56.64 58.82 B: like middle aged er middle school aged 

59.02 59.45 B: kids 

59.59 64.86 B: and it would be kind of like a (( )) type of school which is like where they learn 

64.97 66.36 B: dance and art 

66.48 76.74 B: and writing and politics and history and like lots of creative stuff um and it would be kids from like all over the world and that's like my dream so i'd really really really want to do it and i would 

69.56 69.87 A: cool 

77.08 78.28 B: really really would want 

78.37 80.23 B: the million dollars 

80.38 82.09 B: but i think that 

82.39 84.86 B: barring some kind of loophole that 

86.03 86.49 B: you know 

87.20 90.86 A: yeah i think you could make a lot of people happy with it and i think 

91.81 95.58 A: i think i mean you could give part of it even to your friend i mean 

96.24 97.90 A: you don't have to talk to them but 

98.31 101.60 A: you could like i don't know keep in touch with him somehow 

102.05 105.33 A: like maybe over the internet with chat or something 

106.41 111.35 B: yeah but does that count see i wouldn't if i couldn't see them though 

108.53 108.92 A: i would 

111.81 112.23 B: it would 

112.48 113.76 B: you know 

113.54 114.27 A: yeah 

114.40 116.54 B: like just chatting would be really 

116.68 117.61 A: not as fun 

118.66 119.12 B: yeah 

119.79 120.51 B: i mean 

121.02 123.51 B: like my b- and the other thing is that i think 

123.74 126.73 B: throughout our lives like we um 

127.96 130.30 B: you know like friends kind of come and go and 

130.40 133.50 B: you know the person that was your best friend in the third grade is 

133.91 134.48 B: you know 

134.68 139.04 B: in for most people is not the same best friend that they still have now 

138.37 138.96 A: yeah 

139.21 146.72 B: um but i think that the best friends that i ha- that i have now are going to be with me for probably the rest of my life you know 

146.90 148.72 A: yeah i i believe that too 

149.63 150.02 B: (( well )) 

151.46 156.58 B: like do you have do you have just like one best friend that you're like really close to or do you have like a lot of them or 

156.71 157.93 A: i have a couple 

159.02 162.59 A: pretty good friends i don't know if i'd call them best friends 

164.16 165.18 B: how long have you known them 

166.14 167.37 A: uh quite awhile 

168.43 169.39 A: since high school 

168.48 168.83 B: hm 

170.65 172.08 B: since high school see that 

172.90 175.42 B: actually my friends like i've well one of them 

175.76 178.46 B: i met my senior year of high school but 

179.35 179.79 B: um 

180.37 181.30 B: the rest of them 

181.53 182.51 B: have been kind of 

184.44 187.05 B: you know i've met them in college or at work and stuff and 

188.00 189.87 B: and i think like that's when you really make like your 

190.33 191.54 B: your really like 

191.65 195.07 B: your best friends because you're in a place where you can kind of choose 

196.16 197.76 B: who your best friends are you know 

198.26 200.10 B: like when you're in school you kind of get like forced 

200.88 207.08 B: it's like the people you go to school with and you you do things to be cool and to be accepted and to be popular and 

207.25 207.97 B: and 

208.09 214.30 B: like it's like when you get older it's like you realize that your life is up to you and anything you want to do you can do 

214.49 214.75 B: like 

215.10 220.16 B: yeah like you can kind of pick your friends based on like more intelligent things like whether or not 

220.45 223.20 B: you have like the same values or or interests 

223.38 224.82 B: in the same stuff you know 

224.93 225.46 A: yeah 

226.95 228.01 A: a good point 

229.78 232.84 B: but i mean a million dollars 

233.10 234.04 B: i don't know eh 

234.22 235.44 B: and i'd be like really 

235.89 239.56 B: sketched out by someone that wanted to offer a million dollars for 

240.07 241.13 A: yeah um 

240.50 241.11 B: you know 

241.40 243.95 B: it's kind of like that movie indecent proposal 

245.22 246.31 B: kind of sketchy 

246.85 248.67 A: well i have multiple 

249.03 251.28 A: friends and like one of them if we 

252.11 258.71 A: maybe like if we were starting not to be as good of friends i'd just like yes we are he's my best friend 

259.50 262.54 A: and then get the million and be like tee-hee-hee (( night night )) 

259.51 259.99 B: yeah 

263.33 266.78 B: that's true because they said only singular right 

267.03 270.57 B: like your best friend as opposed to like plural or whatever 

272.81 275.18 B: see that's what i mean like if there's like a loophole to get around it 

275.71 278.27 B: and then i could just like start my school with 

278.42 278.95 B: you know 

279.32 279.72 A: yeah 

279.94 280.97 B: my real best friend 

280.91 282.99 A: bet you'd make a lot of friends there too 

283.72 290.49 B: yeah it's kind of like people coming you know like marrying people in the country just to get a green card or something like that 

290.66 291.13 A: yeah 

292.54 293.58 B: not that you know 

294.97 295.34 B: but 

295.64 296.63 B: where are you calling from 

297.01 298.01 A: wisconsin 

298.39 301.24 B: wisconsin i'm like it sounds like she has 

301.38 303.18 B: (( sorry )) has an accent

316.35 316.91 B: um

323.99 325.08 B: at this school 

326.39 327.55 B: well and

332.34 337.00 B: you know get money to like buy the property or whatever and then like build the school like 

337.83 344.52 B: do it like maybe like do it like a barn raising style you know where like everybody comes and that's going to be working there and like helped create it 

345.90 347.98 B: and then you know start recruiting um 

348.55 351.28 B: kids like based on like an application process so that they can 

351.82 353.37 B: come for free and stuff 

356.69 359.60 B: it'd also be kind of more like activist based 

359.72 361.53 B: like the kids would learn a lot about like 

361.81 362.94 B: social activism and 

364.11 364.59 B: um 

366.04 367.77 B: like social justice issues and stuff

481.86 483.59 B: indicative of that telling

537.49 538.10 B: yeah 

541.28 541.91 B: i mean 

542.42 551.42 B: i think i'm uh kind of interested in seeing like what their results are you know because they're obviously doing this like for a study or something like studying how people 

552.37 562.50 B: interact with each other and like how they communicate and so i'm kind of wondering like if they have like a hypothesis or something if they're working towards some kind of theory and if so like 

562.79 563.44 B: you know 

564.38 565.21 B: to do
