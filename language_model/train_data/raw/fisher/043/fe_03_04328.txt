0.36 2.42 A: hi my name is geraldine 

2.03 4.30 B: hi i'm mallory 

4.55 17.99 B: um so where what would you go back to change if you could change would you go back and change something that you did or or like would you try to change something that happened in in the rest of the world or 

18.19 20.12 A: (( ah you know i )) 

20.33 24.87 A: i i [laughter] i love their philosophical questions [laughter] 

24.06 25.21 B: yeah 

24.79 31.63 A: [laughter] but um what would i change i guess i you know i obviously i always think that you know as you grow older you 

31.52 46.23 A: grow wiser also so i think i would i- if i were to change it would be within my own lifetime it would probably be my teenage years because i feel that you know i i think lack of confidence um [mn] 

46.21 49.28 A: stopped me from pursuing a lot of ah 

49.38 57.36 A: you know discovering more about the world and about my surroundings that you know i wish i had had the opportunity to 

52.02 53.11 B: uh-huh [noise] 

58.48 68.86 A: to explore more things and just out of shyness and lack of confidence you sort of hold yourself back and don't think that you can do it and i've noticed with time you know i think the 

68.91 75.05 A: the beauty of maturity is that you're no longer so self conscious or so self aware 

75.13 85.10 A: of your mistakes you just sort of go for it and you know le- let let the mistakes teach you lessons as opposed to being afraid of what those lessons may be 

84.79 85.90 B: right 

85.58 88.84 A: but um i think that would be about it how about yourself 

88.94 96.59 B: um yeah i would i i i actually i spend way too much time i'm al- i'm always thinking like 

96.67 102.70 B: wishing that i could go back and i you know there are just there are different things in my um 

102.76 107.75 B: like in in high school that i wish that i had gone that i had done differently but 

107.84 120.91 B: um i think god what what if i had what if i had not done this and you know where where would i be now and it's kind of it's kind of silly because you know i did make those choices and so 

120.88 126.78 B: um you know and that's where i am so i i feel i'm like i need to just move on but um 

121.13 122.06 A: right 

126.99 135.99 B: if i try i try not to dwell on it but it's hard because you know they yo- i've they're you know big quest- or big big changes that i've made in 

135.99 147.47 B: in my life like i like when um at the beginning of of high school my family moved and that wasn't really a choice of mine but i was 

147.49 154.75 B: i always think you know what if we had moved somewhere else or what if we had not moved and what would i be doing and [cough] 

153.96 167.89 A: i know it is always i mean i i i can only understand what you're you know you're saying but it's true i mean there there are some things that are more life changing or more dramatic than others i i did go through a big change i i came from um 

167.96 170.53 A: a latin country where i knew my 

170.77 183.89 A: my sort of my ah my friends for the entire i mean through my entire schooling experience from kindergarten i knew them up to the tenth grade and then all of a sudden i moved here 

173.53 174.55 B: mhm 

183.25 184.41 B: right 

183.88 187.05 A: (( i found myself just so like )) 

186.85 201.17 A: pulled out of my element because it wasn't just a language issue it was just cultural and and not re- you know and realising that entire safety net like i could no longer go out because my mother was under the impression you know she still was a- 

201.16 207.25 A: an old fashioned thinker that she had to know the parents of my friends [laughter] [laughter] and 

203.07 204.34 B: mhm 

205.41 206.88 B: right [laughter] 

207.05 218.87 A: even something as simple as that so i found myself just hibernating you know a lot and i think wow you know i now i look back on my high school like you know a the high school book and i say the year book and 

218.71 226.30 A: i look at all these you know and i hate to say it because i am an american now i've been here for twenty years but i call myself an outsider 

223.70 225.05 B: mhm 

225.73 227.11 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

226.65 239.01 A: and i look at all these americans having all these activities and doing all these things and you know being the you know members of the tr- track team and all this i go what did i do i slept it away but you know it was just um 

237.02 238.17 B: [laughter] 

239.45 248.78 A: i i don't know you know some time i think you know i mean i'm not sure oh w- what your experience was um it it does sound it was life changing but um 

248.92 261.69 A: i just find that i i think it i don't know on on general terms i t- i have come to the conclusion that i prefer to experience than to live too sheltered because at least when you experience 

261.71 262.53 A: you 

262.67 277.24 A: there's a layer of yourself that gets um that that gets explored and and that you at least learn something out of it and even if you say i'm never going to do that again y- you test your boundaries and living in a safety 

277.29 281.58 A: i- in sort of a safe bubble doesn't allow you to even ex- 

279.29 280.83 B: right 

281.40 289.71 A: experience those boundaries and say you know i may never wanna do that again i i don't even know that because i was so in in such a sheltered 

289.53 298.21 A: um you know environment but you know i do understand that there are within that there are obviously boundaries that you may never wanna cross you know i'm 

298.23 304.01 B: yeah and i'm happy so that's that's the thing it's like i'm happy now so 

303.92 318.42 B: um what's i- it's it doesn't make a lot of sense for me to to think wh- what would have been if i had done something else because you know i i i did what i did and what happened happened so now that i'm 

315.41 316.38 A: yeah 

316.65 325.53 A: exactly have you have you in cont- ah in touch with friends from that time frame or that were sort of going through a similar experience as yourself 

325.11 331.33 B: yeah sometimes and i mean i i made friends when i moved and um 

326.73 327.45 A: mhm 

331.34 345.25 B: and and there was actually when i when i came there was a girl who was in exactly the same situation we she had just moved from another state and um and we kind of formed a bond because we were both 

345.37 351.88 B: lonely and um so it was it was a way to meet people in in some ways 

347.03 348.11 A: (( yeah )) 

350.63 351.19 A: (( [mn] )) 

351.67 354.36 A: hm no it's just it was interesting when you you 

354.13 362.79 A: keep in touch with ah you know even within the fam- a family you know [mn] you're i i found like my sister and i went through the exact same experience and 

362.56 375.96 A: we both reacted so differently and she's hurt by different things and i'm hurt by other things and i always find that that even if you put two human beings and put then through the exact same experience they come out with a different lesson you know um 

364.61 365.71 B: mhm 

374.29 376.36 B: right right very much 

376.07 383.77 A: so it's just you know it's just curious if you had kept with people from that same time frame and ah and seen what you know what they had 

383.83 389.99 A: what they had become or you know how it had affected them if at all and and all that but um 

390.14 393.19 A: so how did you le- how did you hear about this program 

393.42 399.29 B: um it was it was through a website actually and then i a- and then i also in a magazine 

399.59 400.60 B: um 

399.88 405.00 A: that's interesting 'cause i i saw it a- at a website and then i went onto 

404.89 410.68 A: their site but the one thing that kept me a little bit skeptical was i 

410.56 425.36 A: you know at the beginning i was like well this sounds legit but why are they asking me for my social security number [laughter] you know [laughter] [laughter] so i was like i never give i i mean that i heard that was like a big no no in the internet you never give your social security number so 

415.41 418.60 B: yeah yeah it is a little weird 

423.17 424.47 B: mhm 

425.10 426.16 B: yeah 

425.20 428.78 A: i gave them call and you know they they were legit so 

428.40 441.42 B: yeah i i didn't even think about it because i do a lot of experiments in in um i'm on a college campus and i they they have a lot of like different different psychology experiments that i do so 

441.43 442.25 B: i 

441.50 445.53 A: oh that's interesting what college i- if you don't mind my asking you don't have to answer 

444.80 448.73 B: no it's i go to columbia university in new york city 

448.61 457.38 A: oh nice i just moved from boston to miami of all places [laughter] um i'm going through a major weather shock here 

453.15 454.72 B: (( [laughter] )) 

457.06 458.47 B: yeah i bet 

458.83 461.87 B: um what country are you were you originally from 

461.12 463.05 A: so originally ah venezuela 

462.82 463.90 B: oh wow 

463.90 465.13 A: yeah 

464.70 465.84 B: yeah 

465.24 478.04 A: doing a little bit of jumping around [laughter] but i lived in miami many years when i first be- you know when i first moved to the states i i lived here and then i kind of did a little bit of travelling within the united states and 

467.01 468.30 B: [laughter] 

478.12 487.73 A: for family reasons i've i've returned but not to my you know i definitely think then ah new england is where it's at i i love it up there it's really nice 

486.32 487.43 B: yeah 

487.71 488.89 B: yeah 

488.25 489.41 A: and ah 

489.60 498.56 A: so enjoy your time there because ah you know [laughter] i know that we all end up moving somewhere else at the end you know it's it's nice to you know 

498.36 509.49 A: live wherever you're at enjoy it to its fullest because ah things are all seems to be temporary even when i was like completely set i thought i would never move out of boston i was just so happy there and ah 

509.49 513.44 A: you know so it goes you know you just keep ah keep on trucking as they say 

513.04 525.64 B: right so the i mean since that was that was probably your biggest move though was from from venezuela to here i i mean and then you say and that was what you mentioned when 

514.58 515.47 A: and 

525.61 527.54 A: (( yeah exactly )) 

525.72 535.06 B: as far as the time the time travel is that a- are you are you happy with having made that move i mean i guess it was yeah 

532.65 539.93 A: oh i'm absolutely happy and and that was part of the you know when i asked you if you were keeping in touch because i keep in touch with ah well 

539.74 550.22 A: i keep in touch with you know obviously you know i i i talk with my sister and we talk about you know how that experience ah ah you know affected us or at least how we perceived it 

549.99 563.10 A: and then i also talk to friends that i left behind and their experience and it allows me to at least see what would have happened had i not made the move so i i get it the ability to compare both outcomes and um 

556.86 557.96 B: (( right [noise] )) 

563.14 569.92 A: and i see what they're going through and and i'm i feel very blessed that you know i we had the opportunity to 

570.06 582.59 A: to move here um you do trade things ah because every every decision has a trade off and i think i traded obviously you know experiencing my heritage as an adult 

582.49 587.72 A: and also you know the emotional bond that exists 

587.68 599.89 A: in latin communities are way stronger than i have found here it's just simply as a cultural thing you know the you know people are very you know i i it's not that they are not here 

590.80 592.53 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm ))
