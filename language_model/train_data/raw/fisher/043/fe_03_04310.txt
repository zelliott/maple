96.09 100.88 B: um well i did my thesis on the peace 

100.93 107.84 B: process in northern ireland but i guess it was more of a general focus just western europe kind of 

103.08 103.84 A: uh-huh 

105.75 106.73 A: gotcha 

107.94 110.03 A: gotcha and then if you could 

108.44 109.19 B: of 

110.17 115.25 A: if you could find a a job that would apply to that well like what would your ideal job be 

115.54 120.94 B: [sigh] um i don't think i have one [laughter] i think that's part of the problem 

119.83 120.41 A: (( [laughter] )) 

120.54 124.88 A: gotcha don't know where to look [laughter] gotcha 

122.59 123.84 B: (( that's right )) 

123.90 125.11 B: how 'bout you 

125.33 127.67 A: um about the time travel 

127.70 129.17 B: yeah 

128.56 131.43 A: um if i could change one thing 

131.65 133.36 A: well 

133.72 135.07 A: [sigh] um 

136.04 145.06 A: when ah when i was in college um my ah my parents gave me the opportunity to ah to travel abroad or study abroad for ah 

136.45 137.22 B: [laughter] 

145.29 148.56 A: for a semester and um at the time i 

148.47 154.40 A: got the information i read about it i thought about it but for some reason i just never did it um and then 

153.12 154.11 B: right 

154.30 165.99 A: later on when i finished school i travelled for a couple months and um i met a lot of students that were studying abroad and ah and each of them was just absolutely having the best time of their lives and so 

165.80 178.25 A: um so i kinda think that probably one of the the bigger mistakes i've ever made was was not taking my parents up on that offer to go [laughter] and party in another country for free for a couple of months [laughter] yeah so but ah ah it's 

171.73 172.65 B: right 

173.87 175.35 B: [laughter] 

176.43 178.35 B: so where do you think you would have gone mm 

178.66 183.35 A: a good question it's it's ah the the material that i was reading ah 

183.16 186.74 A: for the program that i was looking into was um was in israel 

186.51 195.38 A: and ah i think that would have just been an amazing experience um i think ah although i i was travelling in europe so so all the people that i met were in 

195.16 206.98 A: italy or spain and places like that and um at the time i i hadn't been thinking about those places but you it'd be just amazing experiences also um so yeah i think i probably would have ended up in israel though like ah 

206.17 207.01 B: right 

207.31 212.59 A: and back then things were a little safer and um that would have been a cool experience to do so 

212.41 213.47 B: yeah 

212.61 216.15 A: [sigh] kinda wish that i could but would i 

216.50 227.86 A: would i actually go back in time to change that don't know if i really would [laughter] i i i mean if if i could go back in time i'd love to go back in time and like see i don't know dinosaurs or you know 

218.79 220.19 B: [laughter] 

228.00 235.00 A: early america like that but i don't know if i'd wanna go and bother with my own life as i [laughter] travelled through time i guess [laughter] 

234.46 238.68 B: no i don't think so either 'cause then something else would get messed up 

236.11 237.44 A: yeah [laughter] 

238.53 239.38 A: yeah 

239.47 247.27 A: [laughter] just like in back to the future and you know what if you met your your old self well that'd be a big trouble right [laughter] um you 

244.01 245.08 B: [laughter] 

245.97 247.69 B: too depressing [laughter] 

247.45 253.69 A: i know totally [laughter] so ah if given the option would you rather travel back or forward 

248.63 249.27 B: [laughter] 

254.38 255.95 B: um 

256.05 257.02 B: (( hm )) 

258.19 261.71 B: i guess i'd rather travel 

262.35 265.49 B: well if i'm travelling forward do i get to come back to now 

265.29 266.61 A: oh yeah definitely 

267.36 271.56 B: i guess i'd rather go back then because if you go forward then 

269.29 270.50 A: yeah ha 

271.91 276.74 B: well i guess it things could be better and then you have something to look forward to 

276.87 277.77 B: but 

277.14 279.74 A: right i guess i'm thinking like 

277.79 280.53 B: if you go forward and think they're awful 

280.66 282.06 A: true true 

282.56 287.23 A: i think if i went forward i'd just go way way forward and and [sigh] ah 

286.31 287.81 B: (( beyond yourself )) 

287.67 299.80 A: yeah way beyond myself just to [sigh] you know so i wouldn't bother with again bother with my own life but um but i could just see you know what humanity's going to [laughter] become in a long time i think that would be kind of cool see if it's even around [laughter] 

299.20 301.37 B: yeah yeah that's a big question 

301.10 308.47 A: yeah see how we we've solved the problems that that are going on today in the far distant future would be kinda cool 

309.00 313.53 A: so [laughter] well so you said you were in philadelphia 

313.24 314.28 B: mhm 

314.10 317.90 A: gotcha and are you a student now or you're all graduated now or 

317.70 320.07 B: yeah i graduated last may 

319.95 320.99 A: gotcha 

320.12 320.93 B: so 

321.28 324.47 A: and ah and how'd you hear about this ah experiment 

324.39 327.79 B: um i think i saw it in a newspaper 

327.81 328.51 A: (( ha )) 

328.91 334.46 A: and i'm wondering what they're gathering from it i don't i don't remember like what the purpose 

334.75 336.35 B: i wonder too 

336.51 337.50 B: (( i ah )) 

336.91 345.66 A: is [laughter] so we've got random people talking to each other and [laughter] no idea who you are and we're talking about time travel but then what [laughter] what do they do with that 

340.38 342.11 B: [laughter] 

345.33 348.61 B: [laughter] just think they'll play this in the classroom some day 

348.58 359.16 A: yeah [laughter] all the students are chuckling right now [laughter] [laughter] no yeah we'd like to travel to the future to see that that's that's what we're talking about here 

352.10 353.76 B: [laughter] 

359.02 361.50 B: that probably is what they're talking about [sigh] 

359.09 367.53 A: [laughter] yeah [laughter] funny stuff well so what else do we do do we do we keep talking or [sigh] 

367.42 371.96 B: i i think we have to keep talking about time travel if they want us to call back again 

371.99 381.34 A: okay [laughter] sounds good um ah well so let's see what else is there to talk about time travel i i'll tell you a funny anecdote um i had a roommate in college who 

373.06 374.53 B: [laughter] 

383.05 389.72 A: [mn] he he was he was crazy and um there were a few things in the world that he 

389.84 394.52 A: proclaimed as hating and those included the french 

394.34 408.95 A: and time travel and those [laughter] were the two things that he absolutely hated in this world and i think i think the french i think it was completely baseless i think he had absolutely no reason to hate the french he had lived in europe for a while um like he was his that was in the army or something but um 

395.79 397.36 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

409.04 416.91 A: but why he would out like outright hate the french ah it made no sense and and time travel he hated because he was he was um 

417.42 422.19 A: i guess he was just kind of like a a science fiction geek in ways and so um 

422.38 431.89 A: and so for some reason the fact that i i think he thought that time travel was totally implausible and so as a result he hated it and so he hated any movie that had anything to do with it 

429.18 430.35 B: [laughter] 

431.65 444.08 A: um you know right on down to something classic like back to the future or something and [sigh] um and he just proclaimed this hate everywhere he [laughter] went it's i hate the french and i hate time travel [laughter] it was really really 

440.66 445.45 B: [laughter] and i hate the french who time travel the most 

444.47 456.13 A: totally that's the worst [laughter] and who can blame him really i mean [laughter] yeah so those are some ah some interesting days living with that guy [laughter] 

446.85 448.50 B: (( ah [laughter] )) 

455.48 461.19 B: yeah i remember i i caught some kind of news blurb and they were saying that one day 

461.43 475.37 B: travel to the past will be possible and my friends were like oh that would be great to think you could you know prevent the holocaust and all these other awful things that have happened and i was like but then maybe you wouldn't have even been born 

470.59 471.83 A: yeah 

475.44 482.35 A: true true and then if if if you affecting the holocaust let's say you went and offed 

476.95 478.18 B: (( you know and then )) 

482.36 483.28 A: (( hitler )) 

483.35 490.05 A: with that and that affected you being born would that affect you existing at that moment offing hitler 

490.04 498.39 A: i don't know [laughter] when all of a sudden you disappear the moment that you did something that would cause your birth not to occur 

491.03 491.91 B: (( yeah no )) 

499.02 500.98 A: [sigh] hard to say [laughter] 

500.84 502.49 B: yeah i think so 

502.35 503.65 A: [laughter] 

502.53 507.05 B: only my grandparents my grandparents met during world war two so 

506.56 507.29 A: (( ha )) 

507.52 511.19 B: they never would have left europe they never would have met 

507.95 508.94 A: (( yeah )) 

511.08 513.82 A: right and my my grandparents ah ah 

514.55 524.41 A: fled from ah my grandfather fled from poland um as a result of the war so i think that's how our family came out here in the first place so 

520.54 521.13 B: (( mm )) 

523.60 526.19 B: right well my grandparents are from poland too 

526.09 529.08 A: oh really [laughter] no like [laughter] are you jewish as well

529.56 531.23 A: no okay gotcha 

531.32 537.32 A: funny stuff though [laughter] so ah yeah so i don't know it would be it would be weird to see us 

532.89 533.51 B: (( not )) 

538.42 540.64 A: (( [sigh] if all of a sudden you would disappear and )) 

540.58 541.83 B: [laughter] 

541.53 543.35 A: then if you would disappear 

543.23 546.05 B: would you be able to go into the future and change that 

545.80 546.77 A: exactly 

547.02 549.30 B: or would you be able to go back even further 

547.20 548.53 A: [laughter] 

549.43 553.25 A: and where would you go would your photos fade like in back to the future [laughter] 

551.08 554.43 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

553.69 557.47 A: [laughter] i just don't know [laughter] 

556.83 559.52 B: maybe photographs would never be invented 

559.60 563.94 A: yeah god who knows what would happen [laughter] 

563.01 568.10 B: i i think we both we both agree that time travel is a bad idea altogether 

568.08 569.52 A: yeah yeah well 

569.84 572.69 A: (( [sigh] ah well i don't know it it )) 

571.49 573.98 B: you're like i i disagree with that comment 

574.04 580.56 A: yeah i'd i'd love to i'd love to go back and see things i just don't know if it'd be a good idea to to mess with things 

580.31 581.23 B: right 

580.60 590.75 A: and i don't know if that's really even possible so i guess we get to leave it up to the people in hollywood to make movies about the past and the future and [laughter] and we can have that for a couple of hours 

590.57 591.66 B: right 

590.94 594.04 A: [laughter] yeah it would be
