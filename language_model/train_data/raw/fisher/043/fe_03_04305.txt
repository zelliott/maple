36.37 47.67 B: a lot of people say that they wouldn't wouldn't change anything but i don't think they ah they say the truth because ah many times we would like things to be changed in our past [sigh] so 

48.00 50.90 B: obviously i would like to change a lot of things 

51.37 56.47 B: but um i have to think a little bit about what the most important [sigh] 

56.54 57.97 B: well um 

58.57 60.63 B: i think i was ah 

61.37 69.39 B: i was really upset when they took me out of a school that i liked and they put me in another school and they didn't ask me i mean my parents so

73.23 74.17 A: mhm 

74.46 76.16 B: (( and ah )) 

76.49 80.95 B: [sigh] there are a lot of other things too but i just came up with one now 

81.17 83.87 B: if you want you can share another one mhm 

83.35 84.92 A: sure um 

84.94 87.54 A: i think probably um 

87.56 97.87 A: my main ah thing i'd like to change is i would have liked to have ah completed college um right out of high school i joined the military service and 

97.81 109.30 A: i ah stayed in the military for four years in active duty and went overseas and went ah into desert storm but i feel like um [lipsmack] now that it it's very difficult 

109.35 117.45 A: ah trying to re enter college um after you've been out for several years so i think if i could change something i would want to change ah 

117.67 122.82 A: ah the fact that i didn't attend college you know right out of high school [laughter] 

122.28 131.76 B: oh okay i see i understand it perfectly well i had a lot of problem with college but eventually i finished it so i graduated few years ago 

131.78 133.31 A: congratulations 

132.92 133.96 B: thanks 

134.02 137.11 B: ah actually i graduated from brooklyn college so 

137.50 141.89 B: i i i live in brooklyn but originally i'm from hungary so 

141.32 142.00 A: (( yeah )) 

142.53 156.24 B: that was another thing that ah i wasn't really asked if i wanted to come here or not but i was already an adult so it was a little bit difficult for me in a few years the first few years in america it was difficult for me but 

156.12 161.26 B: right now i i'm feel like i'm more or less adjusted to this lifestyle 

161.12 162.22 A: good 

162.21 163.72 B: (( and um )) 

164.11 168.20 B: i just think that i wanna i would like to be changed or if i [laughter] 

168.26 169.66 B: well um 

170.28 176.41 B: so many things so ah usually i know what to say because i did it before but ah 

176.51 177.72 A: [laughter] 

176.51 185.41 B: it's a little bit personal because you know a lot of things that are ah you know you wish that they were different and it's a little bit personal you know 

185.49 186.56 A: right 

186.43 187.78 B: you know i mean 

188.12 195.96 B: a lot like if i went out with somebody i wish i went out with somebody else and all these things so [lipsmack] oh 

195.79 199.52 A: right i think um probably another thing i wish i 

199.52 213.61 A: um could have done would been um to have really thought it over before i got married um i've been married um twice and i'm currently not married but i think that it's very important to really um 

213.68 214.73 A: um 

214.80 216.89 A: look into um 

217.37 219.95 A: marriage as a lifetime commitment and 

220.42 231.44 A: that was something i don't think i was so young i didn't really um take it serious as it should be and i i look back on it and i have you know i wish that i could have changed that [laughter] 

230.58 235.57 B: yeah yeah [sigh] it's interesting because i'm just entering my second marriage so 

234.52 235.86 A: mhm 

236.09 242.49 B: obviously i wish i could have done a lot of things in my f- different in my first la- in my first marriage 

242.52 243.47 A: mhm 

242.71 248.03 B: but i wasn't ah think it's almost identical with you because i w- i don't think i was ah 

248.24 257.62 B: mature enough to understand what it meant to be married but um right now i think ah ah i under i mean i've learned a lot of lessons so 

251.23 252.05 A: yes 

258.02 264.31 B: ah hopefully this one will be better [laughter] i mean that's all i can hope for obviously 

261.02 262.38 A: right [laughter] 

264.45 266.04 B: (( and )) 

266.42 273.00 A: i think another thing for me um that i wish i could um go back in time and change is that i wish i would have um 

273.49 278.36 A: had some some kind of a a safety net with my financial um 

278.59 286.13 A: situation before i i decided to have children [laughter] it's ch- children are very expensive to to have and 

281.49 282.31 B: (( ah mm )) 

285.18 286.48 B: oh [sigh] 

286.27 293.74 A: um ah when i had my first um i have two i have a boy and i have a girl i just had a baby the girl and ah 

290.72 291.44 B: (( mm ))

299.11 300.03 B: oh 

299.95 305.50 A: and i wish i when i had my son i was nineteen i wish i would have um had 

305.51 314.70 A: a little bit more put away in savings before i had him because i'm looking now and it's really hard to to see retirement [laughter] 

314.11 320.28 B: i know especially in this in these times like a difficult economic situation and everything 

319.77 321.78 A: yes and it's so uncertain 

322.09 327.38 B: yeah i'm i'm i'm i'm concerned because i have a job now but ah who knows 

327.15 337.47 B: when i'm going to lose it and ah then what i'm gonna do what am i gonna do [sigh] but ah i have to because i wanna get married because i'm already thirty three so 

327.43 328.86 A: correct i know 

337.54 347.74 B: [lipsmack] i mean i did it once but it was really i mean it was a little bit crazy to at at that time so i really hope that um i'm gonna be able to support my family

379.58 387.43 B: my mother told me maybe that's gonna be good for me so i said okay i'm gonna do that [laughter] but it didn't turn out to be a good choice i think 

384.74 385.35 A: (( [laughter] )) 

387.45 394.90 B: especially nowadays when the financial situation is so uncertain anyway like the financial sector and everything so 

387.62 388.97 A: mhm

395.28 399.95 B: you don't need ah people like that i mean they have tons of people mhm 

399.58 409.25 A: yeah you know i wish i would have done the same thing i went to um ah post secondary education i went through training um for dental assisting and

445.63 446.69 B: so we 

445.93 457.47 A: so if i could if i could change that i would have gone back and rethought ah my decision to ah complete that training because i have it and i did very well and received several 

457.84 460.23 A: several commendations for my um 

460.29 464.97 A: for my education do that but i didn't find a job [laughter] in that profession

470.57 471.94 B: [sigh] well um 

472.32 479.56 B: i if i could go back in time i would also change ah my relationship with my brother for example because 

479.95 485.48 B: ah i think ah i bullied him a little [laughter] bit when he was younger 

484.48 489.73 A: [laughter] i think we all did that i have a sister i did that to [laughter] 

485.78 486.92 B: (( and ah )) 

488.46 493.80 B: yeah but i know i did that because i had other pressures on me from other people so 

493.87 506.70 B: you know yeah i just passed it on to him but i wish i could change that now but i tried to make make up for that but i it wasn't that bad but s- still i feel sometimes i feel bad about it 

507.09 509.67 B: [sigh] ah so that's another thing that i 

509.71 512.17 B: you know i wish i could change mhm mm 

510.07 511.25 A: mhm 

511.87 525.84 A: i i wish i could have um [lipsmack] a better relationship with my family and if i could go back and um my my family is normally very close but ah my sister my youngest one has been very um 

525.85 532.18 A: [lipsmack] she's having a lot of trouble and i kind of um have really distanced myself from her because i 

532.85 538.40 A: i just didn't know how to how to react toward her her problems [laughter] and 

537.56 538.55 B: uh-huh 

538.43 548.73 A: i i think she needs somebody to be there for her and it's i i sometimes wish i could go back and and try to be there for her and help her but it's it's hard [laughter] 

547.79 558.68 B: yeah it's really hard to ah even to to help your own sibling it's really hard because [sigh] they have they'll always have different personalities and ah different ah mentalities so 

555.63 556.45 A: yes 

558.64 567.95 B: it's hard to re- sometimes it's hard to talk to them about the most important things but um maybe we should sometimes maybe we shouldn't maybe we should attempt it [sigh] 

568.11 569.72 B: (( it's ah good for us to )) 

569.91 570.84 B: i think 

571.49 573.17 A: i agree [laughter] 

572.30 574.18 B: (( [laughter] yeah yeah yeah )) 

574.40 575.93 B: okay so
