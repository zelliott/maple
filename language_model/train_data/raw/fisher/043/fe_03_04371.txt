18.20 23.53 A: i'd i'd explain it to him and um 

23.90 30.50 A: that would be it i i guess i would that would be it i'd i wouldn't do it but it would set me up for life i 

30.74 36.80 A: it it'd be a horrible thing but he would understand how about you 

37.67 42.91 B: it's a hard one i've got a great i've actually i've got two great best friends so 

43.18 44.36 B: i'd have to pick 

44.70 47.29 B: i don't know if i'd have to not touch both of 'em 

47.43 52.07 B: but [laughter] if if that was the case then that would be bad but 

48.36 49.39 A: yeah 

52.43 53.39 B: um 

54.02 56.92 B: i guess i could write 'em didn't say anything about not writing them 

56.82 59.41 A: (( i i thing it's contact i think that'd )) 

58.14 60.18 B: (( [laughter] )) 

60.42 63.33 B: i know i'm just trying to figure out a good way around it um 

62.72 66.91 A: the the the i i i think they mean any contact i think they 

63.51 65.31 B: (( i i think they're prob- )) 

65.97 68.06 B: yeah i think they do to 

67.19 70.72 A: yeah i i mean writing would be you know i 

69.95 72.50 B: yeah um 

71.52 72.25 A: (( i )) 

72.56 78.97 A: i mean if you see 'em and you you write 'em or or you talk to a friend i mean i you know they they 

73.34 74.02 B: (( [sigh] )) 

78.36 84.75 B: yeah just no contact at all um yeah i'd [sigh] for a million dollars yeah i would because 

80.09 81.20 A: it right 

84.88 86.46 B: you know i think in 

85.03 88.23 A: i mean you got to be honest about it you know [laughter] 

87.31 90.54 B: yeah i i think it's you know 

90.85 94.66 B: if i explained it to 'em or something you know then yeah they'd go for it because 

90.86 91.96 A: (( were )) 

94.72 95.88 B: i think 

96.26 97.59 B: they'd all ah 

97.72 101.06 B: would all pretty much do the same thing i mean you know 

101.69 102.60 B: (( [sigh] )) 

102.06 115.15 A: right i i mean a million dollars i mean people people understand i mean it's not like you're doing it [noise] for a hundred bucks and you're not cheating somebody and people know i mean you're not bill gates huh 

115.03 120.27 A: you know that a million dollars doesn't mean anything to you and it it it would 

115.57 116.52 B: well 

118.71 131.35 B: and and see i kind of liken it to the same thing as well you know moving across the country or something you know because your life goes on and you lose contact and you may not talk to them again anyway 

131.81 142.50 B: but you know i mean it's just sort of that type of thing i think is you know i mean you know they're there and you know you you could get a message to 'em or something if but 

142.71 144.06 B: like if you're 

143.01 150.75 A: you don't you you you know you don't well y- you can't get a mess- well i i mean i- if worst comes to worst 

151.41 159.84 A: i mean maybe you can't talk and you can't get a message but if worst comes to worst i guess you could send 'em ten thousand you know [laughter] 

159.23 162.26 B: (( yeah um but yeah )) 

161.43 176.07 A: a- an- and i mean they you know i i think anybody that's your really your best friend you say well would really you know if it's your best friend's gonna understand th- this would really make your life and you know they 

163.26 163.82 B: (( [cough] )) 

175.89 181.46 A: they would really understand if they're your really your best friend i'd think they would understand 

180.89 191.79 B: yeah they would and and you know and and they'd wish me well and and you know and like i said if if i was to move like i'd probably take the million dollars and move across country or something i lose contact with them anyway 

182.36 183.50 A: (( and if and if )) 

191.85 193.40 B: you know eventually i'd 

192.34 194.23 A: where are you from 

193.70 195.39 B: [sigh] oklahoma 

194.97 197.69 A: yeah i i yeah i'm from california 

197.45 201.08 B: see so if i moved to california then you know 

201.18 203.68 B: my life and her life would be 

203.95 208.60 B: completely pulled apart and not to mention the time zone 

207.31 215.86 A: yeah initially you'd you'd talk for a lot and then it would less and less and less and then maybe once a year and 

215.27 219.54 B: and maybe a card or something every five years or something you know i mean 

218.73 225.14 A: yeah you know you you you'd you'd fade away after so many years and that would be it 

222.02 222.58 B: (( [cough] )) 

223.67 230.45 B: you know and you'd find you'd find another friend you know you i'm sure you'd find another friend somewhere you know wherever i lived at then and 

228.58 242.93 A: you're gonna and and they're going to too and and no matter how good your best friend is i i mean it's you they're gonna they're gonna go but i mean this is something that realistically 

231.53 233.04 B: (( yeah so )) 

243.26 245.63 A: would would make your life 

245.50 246.95 B: yeah 

245.72 260.39 A: you you know i mean it it y- y- y- you know figuring you got your health it would make your life and as i said if it is your best friend they're gonna understand and if they don't they're really not your best friend i 

259.86 261.68 B: yeah and see 

260.71 261.77 A: i w- i 

262.33 263.83 B: my best friend 

262.49 269.87 A: i i would think so and and anybody who is really really honest with themselves would do it 

269.87 270.88 B: yeah 

270.24 271.86 A: i i think so 

271.64 280.27 B: and see my best friend you know after i explained it to her and stuff then i'm sure she'd understand and and she'd wish me well and and you know 

280.14 289.17 B: have a nice life or whatever and and that would probably be the end of it i mean it would be hard but it you know realistically yeah i'd take the million dollars and never contact her again 

288.86 291.12 A: right and i mean if worst comes to w- 

289.69 291.58 B: and she'd do the same thing 

291.45 298.33 A: right y- you know you could just you know yearly or something send a thousand dollars like i would send 

292.01 292.57 B: (( [cough] )) 

299.12 304.24 A: send a thousand and just say have one unbelievable party on me you know 

304.03 309.56 B: yeah you know or pay off her credit card bill or something you know i mean 

306.03 307.60 A: (( you know eliminate )) 

308.52 312.82 A: right or you know just do with it what you want you know 

309.64 310.20 B: (( [cough] )) 

312.96 327.22 A: and really you know have a great dinner on me and you know do whatever you want with it and then you know you go on with with you life and you you make it and i i think that would be the the way to go 

327.33 339.96 A: and ah i think i like i say anyone who who who who who who says they wouldn't do it is is really lying to [noise] themselves you know ah um 

340.05 352.34 A: [noise] even if the person really ah saved your life i i you know i'd i'm thinking of the best of best friends and risked risked their life for you you know 

352.32 360.32 A: and it was your best friend and it was during a war and they tried to save your life i think even they would understand you know 

360.39 362.15 B: yeah well and it 

360.84 368.26 A: i mean somebody like that maybe you would give ten thousand dollars to or twenty five thousand to you know yes 

362.96 363.52 B: (( [cough] )) 

366.54 380.39 B: yeah well see and it's sort of like high school because you know you've got a best friend all through high school or whatever you graduate you go off to college or jobs or move to timbuktu or somewhere and you'll never hear from them again except maybe 

380.17 382.43 B: at a reunion later on in life 

381.02 389.49 A: a reunion or would you go back you know you know somebody moves away you know like i moved away from my home town
