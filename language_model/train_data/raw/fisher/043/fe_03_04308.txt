105.39 114.76 B: at one time that i thought oh i wish i could go back and change that i guess now as i've gotten older and have gotten a little more perspective to it 

109.21 110.59 A: mhm

115.99 123.78 B: i don't know if it was if you know now i'm thinking well heck that wasn't that important that wasn't that big of a deal i'm forty three
