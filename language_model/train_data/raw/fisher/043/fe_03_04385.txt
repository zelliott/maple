240.00 240.45 A: mhm 

240.58 246.42 B: well i'm still trying to refer people so i can get me some extra money -cause financially i'm not doing so great right now 

246.50 246.97 A: right

251.16 252.13 B: yes 

251.88 252.65 A: you know yeah 

253.08 254.79 A: -cause you know -cause you know the the 

255.64 258.26 A: they'll pay a dollar for each male recruit 

259.06 263.30 A: and if you get ten of -em they'll give you a five dollar bonus on top of that 

263.93 264.22 A: but

269.57 272.84 B: yes well the with these (( )) times that we live in 

272.91 273.75 A: exactly 

273.43 276.52 B: you know people are very leery so i can understand it 

274.88 275.79 A: exactly 

276.37 279.37 A: oh i can too yeah uh what do you do for a living 

280.02 282.41 B: well you know what i don't do nothing right now 

282.45 283.06 A: oh 

283.15 285.03 B: um i'm unemployed right now 

284.85 286.25 A: oh gosh yeah 

285.98 288.06 B: um i had a crisis in my family 

288.74 291.02 B: and um i'm taking care of somebody right now 

291.05 291.68 A: mhm 

292.39 293.85 B: until they get well 

293.94 298.28 A: oh yeah but then you you're not really unemployed you are doing home health care 

299.25 303.33 B: yes but you know i don't get paid for it i put a lot of time into it 

299.30 299.96 A: you know 

301.36 301.95 A: right 

302.05 302.44 A: yeah 

303.11 303.92 A: oh yeah 

304.26 304.71 A: yeah 

304.50 305.47 B: so um 

306.51 308.21 B: luckily i was fortunate 

309.59 315.56 B: you know um sometimes you know they give me a little money i take a little money but you know but i don't really like um 

312.47 312.94 A: mhm 

313.92 314.74 A: oh yeah uh 

316.47 317.80 B: taking money for nobody 

317.94 322.11 A: well but on the other hand you know the the bills keep coming in too you know 

322.83 324.02 A: and if you are you know 

324.52 327.43 A: if you are helping someone or taking care of someone 

328.58 334.46 A: i mean they'd probably do a lot better to have you then just somebody they hired out of the phone book or something 

334.25 335.09 B: yes 

335.13 336.34 A: and so uh but it's 

335.98 340.85 B: i'm just a caring person and i sometimes i get caught up in other people's problems 

337.73 338.09 A: yeah 

340.73 343.12 A: yeah 

342.61 345.02 B: so that's that's the thing about um 

345.14 351.62 B: oh uh friendship sometimes you get caught up in other people's problems and sometimes people don't want to get caught up in other people's problems 

351.47 351.87 A: right 

351.76 357.87 B: so that's why they don't want no friends -cause they say that friends are just problems they want to be all in your business 

353.56 354.06 A: wh- 

355.29 356.10 A: that's it and that's 

357.62 358.07 A: yeah 

358.09 362.77 B: and tell all your business and you know really give you a bad name 

362.57 365.62 A: right and see that's that's why i back off you know 

365.72 366.61 B: yes 

366.31 369.74 A: yeah or the other thing too is they'll come and they'll 

369.98 375.69 A: just really pour out things and then you make suggestions and they won't take any of them 

375.49 377.31 B: yes that is true 

376.09 376.64 A: you know 

377.17 377.71 A: and 

377.80 380.10 A: and at some point you just kind of go well 

380.31 388.23 A: i'm tired of this you know i mean you know you come and you cry and you get me all upset and everything and then 

388.33 393.72 A: like i had one friend and she was just having husband problems and all and i said well the one thing you need to do 

393.85 394.70 A: is drive 

395.16 397.10 A: and she had taken driving lessons 

397.83 400.98 A: and the store was just one straight street and not 

412.22 416.01 A: be- because she felt so trapped you know if he left her what was she going to do 

416.45 417.45 B: yes 

417.02 419.03 A: and she had driving lessons 

419.17 420.54 A: you know and she a license 

421.48 422.76 A: and she was on the insurance 

423.60 426.82 A: but she would not drive that two miles to the store 

427.34 436.00 A: so after a month or so every time she would call me balling oh my life is so bad what am i going to do you just kind of say well i've got to go now bye 

436.37 437.06 B: yeah 

437.25 437.70 A: you know 

438.65 441.40 B: -cause eventually you are going to have to do something about your problem 

441.56 442.83 A: yeah and i'm 

442.30 449.20 B: so what i try to do i try not to get in my friend's business because they would put me involved in their relationship 

446.32 446.71 A: right 

449.24 450.41 A: right exactly 

449.88 452.38 B: and if their relationship don't work and i'm mad 

452.53 453.95 B: and they still back together 

454.28 454.75 A: mhm 

458.98 459.36 A: yeah 

459.24 466.57 B: listen to what they have to say and that is it don't give no advice because i don't like wasting my energy on uh 

461.52 461.92 A: mhm 

466.91 468.51 B: on stupid things 

468.34 474.01 A: yeah and you really it takes a lot of energy you know to you know -cause uh you know you try and 

474.29 478.27 A: you know tell -em advise -em and stuff and it does take something out of you 

478.90 484.73 A: and then you know i mean i don't expect -em to jump up that moment and do it but then a month down the road 

484.83 487.42 A: you know not one inch move has been made 

488.51 489.13 A: why 

489.82 490.40 A: then i just 

490.66 492.24 A: wash my hands of it 

491.88 494.69 B: but i just feel like a lot of people just want to talk 

494.68 495.29 A: that is true 

499.36 499.81 A: mhm 

503.13 503.49 A: yeah 

509.62 512.34 A: yeah that is kind of that is what i've kind of learned you know 

512.74 516.37 A: just kind of nod and grin you know or say it once 

516.58 518.11 A: i'll say the thing once 

518.60 519.19 A: but then 

519.54 521.42 A: not keep hammering at it you know 

521.72 524.02 B: yes but a million dollars will be great 

522.30 522.75 A: you know 

524.14 525.89 A: oh god wouldn't that be 

526.99 528.10 A: oh yeah
