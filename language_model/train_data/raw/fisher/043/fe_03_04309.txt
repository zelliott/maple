42.91 43.83 B: mhm 

44.01 58.00 A: i've got two kids now and ah one at elementary and one in ah junior high but i if i could go back i'd probably change it it'd be education wise if ah dreams and aspiration would have probably been to go to law school ah 

48.54 49.46 B: (( okay mhm )) 

58.12 63.45 A: i i would have changed things as education wise try to get more college time in in and ah

72.80 74.11 B: right 

73.72 80.23 A: if i could go back that that'd be one main thing i'd change would be the education ah aspect of it and ah 

80.28 90.35 A: i had started a career in the military and that ah sometimes i wish and look back that if i'd a stuck that out for twenty or thirty years and and did that as a lifetime goal 

90.18 91.17 B: right

92.56 93.85 B: education 

93.81 108.27 B: wow well i i'm thirty four ah ah i'm single and i probably ah looking back now and it's like i'm starting life over you know i'm like paying my dues for my for a lot of like dumb choices and i probably what comes to mind for me is 

105.65 106.49 A: right 

108.39 113.11 B: ah is ah in high school instead of um [lipsmack] 

113.18 126.36 B: wanting to be so cool and so liked and so loved by the popular kids i should have paid much more attention to my schoolwork and my career um you know what i wanted to do as a career 

118.20 119.01 A: right 

124.98 125.82 A: right 

126.26 140.23 B: i um i was a smart kid um but by the time i got i was like a nerd you know and when i got to twelfth grade i met like the cool kids and they accepted me so i was no longer interested really in in school 

134.92 135.92 A: right 

140.04 150.94 B: and ah i mean i you know i had to take my g. e. d. because i wasn't even in class ah because i was hanging out i probably would have forfeited all that coolness 

143.83 144.65 A: right 

145.69 146.46 A: right 

150.80 161.47 B: to just hit the books really hard and probably go to college 'cause then i i took my g. e. d. i wound up going to ah business trade schools i really wasn't finding anything that i liked 

150.82 151.76 A: right 

159.28 160.11 A: right 

161.73 162.67 A: right 

162.01 168.55 B: and that kind of set like a kind of a bad pattern for me with this still trying to be 

168.61 182.58 B: you know in with the in crowd even with adults you know so i probably would have stopped that before it started and i probably would be more further along as far as making as a career choice i'm i mean i'm in the telecommunications now 

170.72 171.58 A: right 

182.39 196.48 B: i ah my hobby is singing i really had wanted to be like this you know celebrity but you know what what have you but probably yeah i would have gone back i would go back in high school and um would have given myself probably some more self esteem 

182.56 183.31 A: right 

188.29 189.29 A: right 

196.37 202.52 B: and um would have just kept hitting those books i mean some people a few people were able to 

202.62 214.42 B: hang out and be crazy and and and hit the books a few of them were able to do that but i was so overwhelmed and drawn into the whole oh my god i can't believe they wanna hang out with me 

208.10 208.91 A: right 

214.36 215.97 A: right right that was 

214.43 215.79 B: that that 

215.90 225.30 A: i wish i could go back in into exactly on what you're talking about and figure out a way 'cause especially with my kids now 'cause my boy's thirteen and my daughter's nine and 

215.90 216.73 B: yeah 

216.89 217.85 B: [laughter] 

223.49 224.35 B: wow 

224.61 225.58 B: okay 

225.23 238.63 A: right now he's he's hitting that age of of going through the change and the puberty and wanting to be cool but he's right now he's holding real good grades both of the kids are but he's entering that stage where so much peer pressure 

234.73 235.65 B: okay 

238.46 241.68 A: is on him going into you know from junior high to high school 

240.92 242.37 B: right 

241.79 243.03 A: (( that ah )) 

242.79 245.71 A: that's where i worry 'cause i look back at myself and i 

244.88 246.08 B: mhm 

245.48 254.42 A: same thing with me i ended up getting my g. e. d. is what i ended up doing and that ah i look back on what you're talking about and there was so much pressure there 

253.79 255.01 B: mhm 

254.19 261.19 A: instead of focus it it almost seems like it's a i don't know if it's a age gap thing or at the age you're at or wanting to be accepted 

260.68 262.00 B: right 

261.29 267.82 A: fartherest thing from my mind was education at the time i find myself more at thirty two years old now 

267.90 281.57 A: ah would love to go back to school now if i had the time and ah i could really just go nuts with it going back to college now but back then that was the last thing on my mind was was you know responsibility and what's going to happen five or ten years from now 

271.40 272.13 B: (( right )) 

277.47 278.33 B: yeah 

281.15 292.56 B: exactly exactly who knew and it's like so everything is so like hard now and it's like i look back and a lotta stuff that you're like ah i'm not going to need that oh that's not going to matter 

287.57 288.39 A: right 

292.47 293.42 A: right 

292.58 303.85 B: it kind of matters now you know and it's i'm sure it's even the pressure's even ah harder on our on our youth like that i mean you said you have a son thirteen and a daughter nine the pressure 

303.95 308.73 B: is is har- even harder i think on them than it was when we were in school 

308.56 319.46 A: right oh yeah my nine year old comes home she's in the third grade she comes home worried to death about what's she's wearing and she says this in the morning before she goes to school how she's gonna look what the kids are gonna say 

314.76 315.82 B: mhm 

319.31 328.36 A: and you know and i tell my wife this is just outrageous she's in third grade you know here she thinks she's sixteen seventeen years old and these kids are competing already 

323.05 324.07 B: (( right ))

327.45 329.17 B: yeah it's crazy 

329.29 334.78 A: but ah yeah i look back with with total regret that worries me with my kids of 

334.66 340.57 A: you know how how do you curtail that how do you fix that to where they don't go through 'cause you know 

340.38 349.93 A: i it with my age and my education i'm looking at any jobs from anywhere from ah you know twenty two thousand ah up to thirty five thousand dollars a year 

349.44 350.32 B: mhm 

349.73 363.28 A: and ah you know i keep telling my kids don't do what i did you know if you can go to college and get a good degree you can make anywhere from sixty to eighty ninety thousand dollars a year and have a better life and have your home paid for and what not and ah 

355.60 356.68 B: mhm 

361.73 363.01 B: exactly 

363.19 371.74 A: so i wish yeah if i could go back it would definitely but i'm i'm like you if i could go back i'd like to go back not just say ten years ago in my early twenties 

371.64 384.51 A: i'd like to go back to the high school days and start fresh from there right at that point where where you really should start worrying about your grades your education if you're going to college or or where you're going from there i'd love to go back and change that 

374.06 375.04 B: mhm 

383.92 392.61 B: yeah 'cause it just ah it just set a pattern that was just it it carried over i mean you don't think that it it's gonna do it but it just 

389.26 390.07 A: right 

391.80 393.27 A: oh yeah 

392.68 399.15 B: it just carries over you know and ah and [lipsmack] now it's like i'm paying for it

528.40 529.38 B: yeah 

528.75 538.20 A: it just seems like and since bush got in office nothing against him but we went from eight years of record breaking numbers the stock market climbing to ultimate highs 

532.76 533.66 B: right 

538.04 551.24 A: the dot com business you know before the bubble busted was just raving people were making a killing more self make millionaires than ever before and it has all went down the toilet so fast it's unreal and ah
