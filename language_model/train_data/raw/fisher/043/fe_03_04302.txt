481.31 481.90 B: (( oh )) 

483.09 484.07 B: right 

483.70 488.89 A: but i just found it to be an interesting field but you know usefulness wise it wasn't 

486.03 487.03 B: mhm 

488.76 489.79 B: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

489.24 499.64 A: so i wish [laughter] i just had not [sigh] you know i had just either taken time off or [sigh] you know had gotten my senses together during college and gone right into nursing 

497.87 498.98 B: right 

499.36 500.47 B: right 

499.83 502.62 A: which has turned out to be a very good field [laughter] 

501.98 506.46 B: oh good [sigh] it takes a special person to be a nurse 

502.81 504.25 A: but you know 

505.78 507.32 A: [sigh] i know but gosh 

506.66 509.70 B: a special calling 'cause i sure couldn't [noise] [noise] 

507.84 512.54 A: [sigh] it does it does but it there's so much more opportunity and and so much 

511.54 513.49 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

512.63 514.63 A: many different fields and 

513.99 515.83 B: especially nowadays 

515.49 516.80 A: [sigh] yeah it's a big 

515.98 517.24 B: you know with a 

516.96 529.19 A: yeah exactly with the population aging and everything [noise] but you feel like you went through um [noise] all this college and then [sigh] you ended up having to pay for two degrees you know and pay for another one [sigh] 

519.29 521.79 B: exactly exactly 

526.94 527.97 B: (( [noise] right )) 

529.02 534.33 B: right [laughter] [laughter] with a four year old and pregnant wowie [laughter] 

529.28 531.11 A: [laughter] 

531.83 532.62 A: (( so oh )) 

532.93 538.58 A: i know [laughter] so that's kind of what i i feel like well had i just done it right from the beginning 

537.95 539.50 B: mhm 

538.68 540.81 A: we wouldn't be paying student loans 

540.65 541.84 B: right 

541.20 544.36 A: you know we i'd be making a lot more money at this point 

543.80 545.61 B: mhm 

544.98 551.87 A: you know things would just be further along than they are but [sigh] you know a lesson learned you know 

546.92 548.07 B: right 

551.94 562.60 A: i don't think uh kids should be pushed that hard but i think you know like what you did is g going into the military was good because by the time you got ready to go to college you you were ready 

554.69 556.10 B: exactly 

557.49 558.93 B: mhm 

562.22 565.66 B: exactly i decided i was going 

565.52 571.62 A: yeah and your the degrees you got were probably you probably thought about 'em for a long time right uh-huh 

566.13 567.14 B: yeah 

567.68 568.87 B: mhm 

571.29 583.36 B: [sigh] well it was uh a run off of the military i was in um office administration and that's what i continued to get my two degrees in personal computers and office administration 

582.90 584.76 A: right right so 

584.08 588.14 B: not that i'm using them i'm staying home with my children for now 

585.63 586.87 A: (( yeah [laughter] [noise] )) 

588.30 590.85 B: [sigh] but it's always something i can fall back on 

590.38 594.95 A: [laughter] [sigh] [sigh] exactly exactly and at least you you took the time to figure it out 

591.33 592.23 B: you know 

594.37 595.83 B: exactly 

595.06 599.89 A: and not run i mean what would you have done if you just went straight into college with no clue
