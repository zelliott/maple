43.96 44.58 A: (( [noise] )) 

44.99 49.39 A: (( hm i don't know there's a lot of there's a lot of things i would change um )) 

51.40 54.10 A: (( [lipsmack] it it's a hard decision um )) 

54.65 56.11 A: (( i ah )) 

57.93 59.26 A: (( hm )) 

60.12 62.16 A: i think 

62.23 67.54 A: well there's a lot of things i could do but um i guess oh what what immediately comes to mind is that um 

67.88 70.22 A: when i was in 

70.50 71.58 A: (( ah )) 

72.91 80.96 A: high school i guess i was ah i was very um [lipsmack] 'cause i was very academically inclined and the somewhat um [lipsmack] 

81.69 83.15 B: [laughter] dorky [noise] 

82.37 87.77 A: i is well i don't know about i don't know d- n- that's not exactly what i'm thinking i guess so i i 

87.80 96.52 A: shunned ah physical activities a lot and um and i came to appreciate the value of ah physical exercise when i was in college and later but when i had a lot less time 

93.77 95.20 B: oh yeah 

96.75 102.44 A: and i wish that i had um had taken advantage of you know the sort of organized high school activities 

102.57 109.86 A: to um to get involved in sports because i sort of feel like like like for example there was a lot of tennis players in my high school and um 

109.09 109.78 B: uh-huh 

110.19 123.86 A: [lipsmack] and i would have liked to get involved in tennis or other physical activities because i feel like i could you know those that's an opportunity to get coaching and to um to make physical exercise a part of your life and to gain a really pretty good skill 

123.94 136.33 A: and then keep it with you and i feel like i haven't had the time to do that since then to to to get to that kind of level well i i i spent spent time doing other things in high school but i sort of wish it was more a little more balanced that way 

133.90 135.59 B: (( yeah [noise] yeah )) 

136.34 147.38 B: so that if you'd started in high school then it would be so in- yeah integrated [noise] you know i was gonna choose something else but now that i think about it me too because i 

136.65 138.07 A: (( yeah )) 

139.12 141.34 A: or earlier yeah yeah [laughter] 

147.52 155.75 B: i sat out of p. e. a lot in high school 'cause i had i had bad knees i went through a tremendous growth spurt 

150.97 152.92 A: mhm 

155.54 156.71 A: oh i see 

155.70 164.16 B: and my my knees were like like a little colt you know and couldn't handle it so i didn't i didn't even start exercising at all until i was like 

160.25 161.08 A: mhm 

164.96 167.78 B: [sigh] god twenty five thirty 

168.45 170.32 B: [noise] and um 

170.43 172.67 B: (( yeah when i was about twenty five )) 

172.58 175.16 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

173.19 174.39 B: and 

174.64 178.32 B: i i realise now how much i really love love it 

178.45 181.29 A: (( mhm yeah yeah )) 

178.70 180.05 B: (( and )) 

180.52 194.80 B: and yet i don't here's one thing if you don't get involved in exercise when you're really young [noise] you don't have you don't build as much lung capacity as much endurance capacity and it's harder to build it as an adult 

190.59 191.65 A: (( mm )) 

195.28 206.07 A: i believe that well it's ac- that's actually one of the reasons big reasons that i didn't exercise when i was younger is that i i'm asthmatic and so i i think i sort of t- picked up on that as something where i 

196.43 197.11 B: (( [sigh] [cough] )) 

201.23 202.03 B: uh-huh 

206.63 208.99 A: almost as an excuse not to exercise 

208.64 209.62 B: mhm 

209.40 219.18 A: whereas of course you know lots of people overcome that i mean my asthma was moderately bad but not horrible there's a lot of people come over overcome worse things than that 

214.74 216.16 B: ah it was exercise 

217.83 220.04 B: was it exercise induced 

219.42 222.83 A: yeah it was completely exercise induced that's a lot of it 

221.48 222.36 B: uh-huh 

222.52 223.54 B: yeah 

223.92 227.79 B: well [sigh] so now i'm grown up and 

228.16 229.51 B: i find that 

229.89 232.60 B: like i i don't i don't have the 

232.61 236.99 B: cardiovascular endurance to do i mean i i can build it 

237.02 237.99 B: but 

238.02 241.71 B: every year if like if i take the winter off of hiking 

241.69 243.58 A: mhm 

241.93 247.29 B: then hiking hiking season comes again every year i start with zero [laughter] all over again 

246.25 249.28 A: right right right 

247.55 251.06 B: you know it's ah it's like okay here we go again 

250.84 253.27 A: mhm mhm 

251.20 257.13 B: you know and if i if i go out dancing after the first dance i'm already exhausted 

256.85 259.66 A: oh right what kind of dancing do you do 

258.57 259.84 B: i do ah 

259.85 270.88 B: country western partner dancing i used to do line i started with line dancing and then i i got a dance partner and i so i do learn more the partner dancing 

262.66 263.73 A: oh wow 

265.38 267.32 A: mhm 

267.98 269.72 A: mhm 

270.88 271.75 A: uh-huh 

271.40 274.86 B: and ah even even line dancing [cough] 

275.08 277.42 B: you know it's all legs 

277.53 279.37 A: mhm 

277.79 280.23 B: and those are your biggest muscle groups 

280.01 281.82 A: right right 

280.37 282.76 B: so it's exhausting 

282.84 284.69 A: mhm 

283.05 287.63 B: and i ha- and i have to tr- almost train for it and the only way to train for it is to do it 

287.69 289.89 A: right 

288.63 292.71 B: which is the other reason to exercise more as a little kid is that 

292.98 297.77 B: you can dev- build muscle memory in a lot of different muscles 

297.78 307.76 A: well that's exactly what i was thinking on the other hand you know i mean muscle memory and muscle mass can you know those those atrophy too very quickly if you don't use them and then you have to rebuild them so 

307.57 308.53 B: yeah 

308.19 311.16 A: you know i think you can still learn a lot as an adult 

311.29 319.17 A: well my my fiancee just started dancing tango ah less than half a yeah ago and she's already gotten very very good and she never danced before so 

314.27 315.66 B: oh really 

316.72 317.65 B: yeah 

319.12 320.93 B: (( oh cool how old is she )) 

319.80 321.78 A: quite remarkable to see [noise] 

322.30 335.65 B: well yeah i never danced either until i was much older but i and i could do it and i'm i'm pretty good but i have to keep doing it i can't train for dance by swimming for instance 

326.33 328.08 A: mhm 

335.17 337.93 A: yeah yeah of course it's all very specific 

336.49 340.74 B: i can't you know yeah it's like you use your legs a lot but 

340.79 349.44 B: the endurance and like i can build endurance for swimming by swimming and i have to build endurance for hiking by hiking and i have to build endurance 

341.23 344.00 A: (( right and the activity is different )) 

347.48 360.94 A: yeah that's another funny thing i always wonder about that endurance wise you would think that you know you would think that like your lu- your cardiovascular system would be pretty transferable but i find that i have great endurance for biking for example and for running i have terrible endurance 

360.62 365.80 B: yeah exactly now i don't know if we started exercising younger whether that would be different 

366.45 369.33 A: no i think it's pretty specific i mean maybe i don't know 

366.60 367.62 B: but 

369.41 372.34 A: so what were you originally going to choose as the thing that you would do over 

372.25 375.26 B: i would change who my parents were 

375.70 380.44 A: oh oh that's that's not fair because then you would you'd be changing who you are 

377.25 378.25 B: [laughter] 

380.16 381.94 B: (( ex- yeah )) 

382.38 393.37 B: and and some of the i mean in some of the [noise] ways that i struggled through life are directly related to who my parents were like the unconscious programing of version one point oh 

388.35 389.69 A: oh i see 

393.95 400.54 B: you know and the and the the struggle of upgrading it to version forty point oh or whatever 

395.26 396.05 A: uh-huh 

400.68 404.13 B: you know it's like it's a constant management 

400.75 401.95 A: (( [laughter] )) 

404.62 406.82 B: (( it's sort of like m- microsoft )) 

404.70 405.54 A: uh-huh 

407.16 409.63 B: you know releasing systems with bugs in it 

409.80 410.76 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

409.95 412.42 B: and then they just go ahead and release them anyway 

413.34 421.06 B: so i [laughter] i'm just sometimes how i feel is the result of being in a family that with the parents that somehow i got 

422.58 425.69 B: that i would have been really different than who i am now 

425.73 431.15 A: oh well i mean you know everybody i mean i don't know i mean plenty of parents have their own strange 

431.17 433.02 A: strange aspects so 

433.21 434.16 B: yeah 

433.43 436.67 A: (( yeah huh )) 

435.21 436.21 B: yeah 

436.33 437.80 B: so well 

437.92 442.70 B: let's go back to exercise that's that would be a longer than eight minute conversation huh 

441.92 448.13 A: huh i can imagine yeah yeah yeah i mean i guess another another thing that so an unrelated ah 

448.50 452.63 A: see then i'm not sure i would change but i i sort of would have liked to changes 

452.94 456.73 A: um so after college i ah i went to taiwan 

456.80 457.62 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

456.93 460.27 A: and ah i studied chinese there i was um [lipsmack] 

460.10 466.08 A: i had studied a lot of chinese before then but i went there and studied the of chinese and i um 

465.90 477.69 A: at the end of the one year i had finished this language program and i had sort of gotten to know everybody there and gotten a little better integrating into the society and i was very happy there 

477.70 492.66 A: and um but i had this scholarship to go to japan and do research there and learn japanese and i thought boy it's such a great opportunity and i i went and it was a very difficult decision because i had just gotten a decent job offer as a translator in 

493.05 503.29 A: in taiwan and i had the opportunity to continue studying chinese and doing even more with it and i had sort of gained fluency and so there there was all this momentum that i had there and i gave it up to go to japan and do something new 

497.19 498.29 B: yeah 

503.57 507.49 A: and a lot of the time i felt i wish i had stayed there for at least another year 

507.57 509.12 A: and really um 

509.57 512.37 A: i guess done more with what i had 

512.86 516.67 A: um and what i had spent all that time studying working to achieve 

513.09 514.11 B: yeah 

516.88 526.39 A: and and of course i had a very you know i had a good time ah in japan too but a lot of ways i wish i hadn't i had done less and ah 

527.54 530.50 A: done less different things and more in depth in one place 

527.87 528.81 B: (( so you got )) 

529.73 532.30 B: yeah he got breadth instead of depth 

530.62 534.03 A: it was very yeah it was very sad that way [lipsmack] 

533.63 534.61 B: yeah 

535.01 538.52 A: those are all those are all difficult traces to make [noise] 

538.12 539.13 B: yeah 

539.32 542.68 B: well ah is is it still sad these days 

542.89 547.31 A: yeah oh yeah of course yeah i think about that uh-huh yeah 

543.16 544.75 B: (( thinking about when you think about it )) 

545.87 549.82 B: are you still in contact with the folks that you thay you met from taiwan uh-huh 

549.24 557.42 A: very little just a couple of people yeah it's it's it's difficult you know um [noise] contact far abroad is hard um 

557.45 564.91 A: it's a lot easier than it used to be of course [noise] but it's still not that easy i mean more recently in the last couple of years it's gotten easier but so for example um 

565.81 577.88 A: you know email contact wh- wh- has been difficult because of my friends didn't use much email or if they did they didn't you know they're chinese speakers and it's only been in the last couple of years that it's really gotten easier to write email in chinese for everybody 

577.63 578.73 B: right 

578.53 582.99 A: so that is a little bit of exaggeration but for the av- for the average person 

583.20 594.37 A: access has sort of lagged a couple of years after um a little slower than [noise] than access in the united states for english speaking people so i i've really lost touch with a lot of people 

591.59 592.28 B: uh-huh 

594.94 596.85 B: (( yeah that would be this )) 

595.72 597.92 A: (( i'm not sure how hard it would be to get back but )) 

598.11 599.89 B: yeah well you'd have to go there
