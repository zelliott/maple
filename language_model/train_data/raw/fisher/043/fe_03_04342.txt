4.83 6.49 B: i'm fine 

6.13 7.56 A: (( good )) 

7.72 8.71 A: well 

8.86 12.35 B: if you could go back in time where would you want to go to 

12.43 15.00 A: i was just thinking about that [laughter] 

14.64 15.69 B: [laughter] 

15.19 17.82 A: and i'm ah i don't know that there's a place 

18.37 21.04 A: back in time that i'd really want to go to 

21.48 23.40 B: well i can think of something 

23.13 25.12 A: well what what where would you go 

24.93 28.35 B: well i would go back to elementary school 

28.01 29.30 A: really 

29.17 35.49 B: because when i was in elementary school i used to not participate in gymnastics 

35.27 36.98 A: uh-huh why is that 

37.12 39.10 B: i just didn't like them 

39.20 41.16 B: but now that i'm older 

40.71 41.94 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

41.28 46.26 B: it's like i wish i did and i wish i was more sports active 

45.86 47.29 A: really 

46.78 48.07 B: yeah 

47.41 48.80 A: oh funny 

48.82 58.58 B: 'cause it's ki- it's kind of like you know i'm not overweight but you know i could stand to be thinner and i think if i was more sport active i would have 

48.82 49.82 A: well why 

50.58 51.64 A: (( [noise] )) 

54.29 55.05 A: (( yeah )) 

56.63 57.65 A: mhm 

58.83 61.82 B: you know stayed more trim you know what i mean 

60.56 64.01 A: oh i see yeah yeah wow 

64.13 65.10 A: (( that's pretty )) 

64.21 69.19 B: is there anything you did like when you were in school or something that you wish you had done differently 

69.32 70.32 A: um 

70.79 79.73 A: there's things i would have liked to avoi- ah have avoided but i just i just don't think i'm the person i would be the person that i am today had i not lived through those experiences 

79.51 81.09 B: because it makes you grow 

80.77 81.76 A: right 

81.80 83.45 A: right and you know 

83.69 89.02 A: it's like even my childhood honestly i had a a pretty miserable childhood 

88.41 89.79 B: oh my god 

89.12 94.76 A: but i'm thinking i i honestly would not be the person i am today if i didn't live through those things 

94.66 97.97 B: because you wouldn't make decisions the way you make decisions today 

96.97 100.49 A: absolutely not it would be so different i can just imagine 

100.51 113.13 A: you know me taking a totally different role in life um by the choices that you know that would have been altered by by the by the things that i had lived through earlier you know does that make sense 

112.83 119.92 B: yes it does yes it does i look at experiences that one has as like a rung on a ladder 

114.02 114.96 A: and 

119.52 120.41 A: uh-huh 

119.94 122.82 B: and each time you have an experience you go up a rung 

122.39 123.88 A: exactly 

123.71 128.22 B: so like if you took a different rung you might be somewhere else 

127.82 136.53 A: exactly totally totally and completely and and it's like i have i have children now and i have wonderful children 

136.57 144.63 A: and the thing that i learned that i dislike from my childhood i can make better for them at least you know what i mean 

143.76 155.33 B: do they do they listen to you though because sometimes it's kind of like you can tell people things that you've learned and it's like they don't listen to you and they have to experience it themselves 

145.63 146.79 A: oh yeah 

153.97 157.32 A: right no they're still little right now so so 

157.02 158.66 B: you can be influential 

158.33 164.11 A: absolutely and and i'm not talking in real complex ways i'm i'm talking about simple things like 

163.99 177.19 A: like you know m- my parents never took the time to read to us when we were little and for me that's just like such a great opportunity you know to read to my children and to spend time reading with them that's just one example you know what i mean 

176.52 178.32 B: right right right 

177.47 180.87 A: and and if i was to go back and change 

180.96 183.53 A: change that in my childhood i don't know 

183.53 185.47 B: whether you'd be reading to your children 

184.98 187.24 A: yeah reading to them as much 

187.37 192.53 A: you know i i i hope that i would still be reading to them you know just because it's it's such a 

192.56 194.64 A: excellent learning tool for them 

194.81 195.56 A: um 

194.91 204.18 B: but on the other hand if you had had reading to you when you were a child you might have been burnt out on it so then you wouldn't be reading to your kids now 

201.48 202.56 A: right 

203.44 207.21 A: it's it's possible it's very much possible you just don't know 

204.68 205.79 B: yeah 

207.22 208.58 B: yeah 

207.34 216.11 A: you know maybe if i had the choice to go back change a few things see how that turned out and if i didn't like it i could go back and change it back [laughter] 

214.34 217.27 B: [laughter] a double dip 

216.71 224.71 A: that's right that's correct well if they could figure out how to go back in time we should be able to do it more than once don't you think [laughter] 

222.27 232.29 B: [laughter] that was a great movie with ah ah what's his name where it was he did time space traveling i can't think it mi- ah michael j. fox 

232.22 234.22 A: oh the back to the future 

233.67 239.69 B: back to the future right right that's kind of like time traveling [laughter] 

234.40 236.27 A: yeah that was cool 

238.84 245.70 A: yeah but but oh my gosh it was just such a brain teaser because if it actually went like that 

245.73 251.11 A: you know there's questions i still have questions about that one [laughter] [laughter] 

248.35 249.98 B: (( i know i know )) 

250.25 259.50 B: [laughter] like when the on one of the movies where he was ah he went back in time and then he made a different choice and his life became different 

259.74 266.71 B: i ca- it was i can't remember it exactly but it was something about it was kind of like very reminiscent of ah 

266.73 269.27 B: the famous christmas movie 

268.93 270.63 A: oh like um 

270.26 272.50 B: you know which one i'm talking about 

271.89 278.49 A: i think so where where the little girl says everytime a bell rings an angels gets to swing miracle is that miracle on 

275.00 277.51 B: yes yes yes 

277.99 281.34 B: miracle on thirty fourth street or something like that 

279.73 281.85 A: yeah some some number street 

281.59 287.96 B: where he kind of like he's ready to kill himself and then the fai- the well the angel stops him 

284.04 285.02 A: right 

285.97 287.18 A: the angel 

287.41 288.86 A: right right 

287.98 297.66 B: and then he says if you weren't around this is what life would be like and he shows all these awful things that's kind of like what time travel is all about 

291.14 292.85 A: would be like yeah 

293.45 294.62 A: right 

296.58 308.48 A: that you know see that would be that would be like the ideal situation just to be able to let let them take you along let somebody an angel or whoever take you along to see how things would change if 

307.55 309.24 B: if you weren't there 

308.79 313.21 A: oh not if you weren't there but if you if you made a few different choices 

312.65 316.79 B: right and then how things would have changed as a result of the choices that you made 

316.17 324.18 A: right right that would be so easy how ch- we would be so cheat- oh man that would be like way cheating life [laughter] 

316.99 319.16 B: that would be pretty cool i know 

322.39 328.60 B: [laughter] i know [laughter] that would be like being in too much control i think 

324.21 325.50 A: [laughter] 

327.93 329.51 A: oh yeah yeah 

328.61 332.28 B: and i don't think you're allowed to be in that much control [laughter] 

331.46 334.84 A: that's true that's true that would be an absolutely insane 

334.75 336.77 B: oh i know i know 

335.41 342.47 A: oh my gosh the options would be just be unlimited totally unlimited [laughter] i mean you could [noise] 

339.15 340.79 B: absolutely 

341.19 343.30 B: what part of the country are you from 

342.98 345.34 A: i am in southern california [noise] 

344.75 347.86 B: oh you are so am i but i'm originally from new york 

347.39 353.27 A: oh okay well i just got to go to new york [laughter] not by time travel either [laughter] 

350.96 351.88 B: oh did you 

352.21 355.07 B: it wasn't time travel had you ever been there before 

354.35 362.95 A: no that was my first time i i went back in november and it was wonderful i so had a wonderful time [laughter] [noise] 

355.86 357.25 B: oh my god 

362.84 364.49 B: (( where are you now oh okay i'm )) 

364.45 366.47 A: oh i'm in westlake village alta loma 

366.84 368.41 B: (( in um alta loma )) 

368.87 372.27 B: oh i know where that is i know where that is i know where that is okay 

369.98 371.05 A: [laughter] 

371.41 373.79 A: oh funny so why did you leave new york 

374.18 378.36 B: um [lipsmack] firstly i went to florida to try to stay with my parents 

377.82 379.12 A: oh okay 

378.54 383.30 B: and then it wasn't working out so i kind of came west with a friend 

382.32 384.12 A: oh oh i see 

383.53 393.62 B: and i think that talking about time travel i think i firmly believe this in another lifetime i think i was brought up in a place that was extremely warm 

389.51 390.37 A: (( [laughter] )) 

393.69 397.96 B: because i've taken to the heat like a duck takes to water 

395.87 396.92 A: oh really 

397.59 399.21 A: [laughter] 

398.23 407.37 B: i adore the heat i love it when it's sunny i love it when it's warm so i really believe that in another lifetime i was born in a desert 

401.65 402.49 A: yeah 

407.25 408.16 A: hm 

408.37 413.01 B: because you know when i b- because when i was brought up in new york it was like always cold 

408.40 409.94 A: maybe you went back 

411.24 411.94 A: (( yeah )) 

412.59 413.43 A: uh-huh 

413.17 414.99 B: and i hated it 

414.19 416.42 A: but they're they have some nice days don't 

416.74 423.18 B: when they have nice days it's like hot and humid it's not as dry as it is here 

421.10 422.33 A: they oh yeah 

422.86 425.32 A: we went in november so it wasn't too bad 

424.53 427.90 B: oh so you have like the winter you were there for the winter 

427.47 432.97 A: but it was really nice it wasn't super cold [laughter] and it wasn't real hot so 

431.97 438.79 B: well see that's another theory i have i think the axis is changing the earth's axis and i think the weather is changing 

436.20 437.79 A: (( the ear- yeah i )) 

438.29 440.77 A: i would have to agree with that definitely 

439.66 446.22 B: because when i was a kid i remember that we used to have these horrible snowstorms where we'd be out of school for three weeks 

445.64 448.54 A: wow how cool [laughter] 

447.56 452.73 B: yeah but you know nowadays they don't have that so i think the axis is tilting 

448.79 449.89 A: (( yeah )) 

452.44 455.46 A: it you're probably right on the money there 

454.80 457.97 B: and that's why the weather keeps changing and everything 

456.77 458.31 A: right right 

458.57 461.37 A: but it was a wonderful i really had a good time there 

460.41 463.74 B: well i'm glad you enjoyed yourself the way i 

461.84 464.76 A: [laughter] so maybe what's that 

464.11 470.51 B: the way i feel about new york now is it's a nice place to visit but i wouldn't want to live there anymore [laughter] 

467.57 469.25 A: [laughter] 

469.36 470.70 A: oh funny 

471.43 480.66 A: so what if what if you did this time travel thing and and this is how you changed your mind you've you've changed your mind about where you want to live [laughter] 

477.87 478.64 B: (( [mn] )) 

479.78 486.70 B: [laughter] really like then what if i was if i did a time travel thing and i 

482.26 483.50 A: (( so funny )) 

486.95 489.67 B: time traveled to a place that was really warm 

489.24 490.11 A: uh-huh 

490.13 495.12 B: that would that mean that now i'd really want to be in a place that it's really cold 

495.31 497.88 A: well no because you found out that you liked it 

497.95 504.77 B: yeah but if you go with my theory that i think i was born in a pla- you know pre born in a place that was really warm 

503.14 503.81 A: (( [mn] )) 

503.94 505.36 A: [laughter] 

505.05 516.06 B: and then i was brought up in a place that was cold so then i had to return to the place that was warm [laughter] [laughter] it could have had an opposite effect you know what i mean 

508.98 511.32 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

511.86 513.35 A: (( so funny )) 

514.27 522.31 A: [laughter] you know what you could have been a polar bear before or something [laughter] a miserable polar bear 

518.61 520.09 B: (( that could be )) 

521.93 524.90 B: and that's why i adore the warmth [laughter] 

523.69 527.49 A: that's right maybe you should have been a camel or something [laughter] 

526.41 529.01 B: [laughter] 

528.39 530.58 A: how funny no 

529.63 531.95 B: or living in a desert or something 

531.30 534.48 A: yeah no kidding huh that would be way too hot i 

533.12 547.84 B: [laughter] no well th- what's cool about new yor- what's cool about southern california is it gets hot but it's not humi- humidity so therefore you can cool off in new york it gets hot and it's humid 

535.11 535.98 A: know that would 

542.75 543.69 A: right it's 

547.53 548.85 A: yeah oh yeah 

548.21 549.14 B: so 

549.17 550.38 B: it's like 

550.61 553.10 B: you feel like you need a bath all the time 

552.63 554.82 A: oh gosh i can only imagine 

553.30 559.62 B: in the summer you know it's like you can cut it with a knife and you're always sweating and the dampness is always around you 

556.23 557.42 A: (( ew )) 

559.26 560.51 A: yucky 

560.51 561.59 B: [laughter] 

560.78 567.78 A: that's when you need to go shopping [laughter] [laughter] you use everybody else's air conditioning [laughter] that 

562.26 564.03 B: i know [laughter] 

564.36 565.17 B: (( i know )) 

566.29 568.94 B: [laughter] i know 

567.89 568.86 A: (( was funny )) 

569.04 570.89 A: (( that was oh man )) 

571.16 574.12 A: time travel that would be incredible it really would be 

574.19 580.96 B: but how would you get there if you could do it would be like in one of those cars that michael j. fox used 

580.22 583.15 A: i don't know i i think i think um more 

582.11 583.98 B: to break a time barrier 

583.81 592.34 A: i n- i think i see it more and more more like um do you remember willie wonka and the chocolate factory remember how the little boy got particlized 

589.00 590.14 B: yes 

592.34 593.34 B: right 

593.03 596.82 A: and i mean they've got to be able to move your particles 

597.06 598.35 A: i just don't know how 

597.19 599.34 B: and put them in the same place 

598.81 599.89 A: right
