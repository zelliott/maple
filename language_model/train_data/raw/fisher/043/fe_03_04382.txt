160.63 166.75 B: i don't feel like th- that no i don't feel that way that i'm not blessed but i just i don't feel that strongly about a friend you know what i'm saying 

166.34 175.23 A: right and you know what that's ah that's an individual opinion you know what whatever you feel from yourself versus how i feel you know everybody's got a different view and a different angle about 

175.28 176.10 A: (( you know )) 

175.55 179.58 B: and you know to me it ah friendship is like a relationship it takes time to develop

191.38 192.34 A: right 

192.68 193.58 A: (( yeah i think )) 

192.86 199.02 B: 'cause you know i find myself being there for people but i don't find myself people being there for me so it's kind of lonely

218.35 231.11 A: so um but like i said you know 'cause i have a i have a i need jaw surgery and stuff like that but i mean it's nothing terminal it's just the fact that you know even before i wasn't even before when i was well i just happened to have an h._m._o. that didn't take care of me basically but 

230.76 231.80 B: okay 

231.46 235.85 A: e- even when i was well and stuff i still had those same friends as when i'm when i was sick 

235.42 238.11 B: that's good that's good 

236.14 237.49 A: yeah so i'm

256.29 261.23 A: (( [laughter] thank you ah yeah yeah exactly [laughter] that's )) 

257.67 258.88 B: and um 

259.90 265.80 B: people are so people are so wary of the programme you know i'm passing out fliers i made forty fliers and passed them all out 

265.35 267.03 A: did you really oh wow 

266.30 268.45 B: telling them about the programme and 

268.11 274.98 A: oh wow yeah i think it's great because for a for the people you know helping out in the different countries and you know the different languages and so on 

274.76 275.69 B: yes 

275.17 287.65 A: i think it's terrific what they're doing and and that's why when i initially called this computer number i um i guess you get um i guess you know you get a a different number each time or something because i tell them i said you know i'll do what i want to do is 

276.85 277.82 B: yes 

286.88 288.79 B: no you don't y- you get the same number 

289.04 290.96 A: oh i'll i'll dial the same number 

290.50 294.59 B: yeah yeah y- you buy your okay you go dial your one eight h- hundred number 

294.39 295.47 A: right 

294.82 302.71 B: or you can dial the p._i._n. number the one eight hundred number's the p._i._n. number no no the one eight hundred number you could dial instead of waiting for them to call you 

296.47 297.45 A: (( oh okay )) 

302.40 303.37 A: right 

302.74 308.24 B: you can call the one eight hundred number yourself and start your initiate your um um 

308.52 310.32 B: conversation with someone else 

310.07 312.29 A: oh you got like a one eight hundred three hundred p._i._n. 

312.75 317.67 B: yeah not that not the p._i._n. one it's a one eight hundred number that they give you 

313.41 314.64 A: (( 'cause i still don't )) 

317.39 324.05 A: yeah the number they gave me in order to get to you what i dialed was eight six six six eight seven four seven five eight 

323.50 326.96 B: yeah yeah that's a that's a one eight hundred number for that 

325.64 328.30 A: yeah it says put in your p._i._n. number type of thing right 

327.60 329.78 B: yeah yeah you've got to put in your p._i._n. number 

329.39 334.86 A: yeah but for when a new study comes up will it be the same number or will it be differ- they told me it'd be a different number 

334.69 336.56 B: it'll probably be a different number 

336.01 337.53 A: (( oh okay how long did you )) 

336.66 341.51 B: but um you know you could pass it on and give somebody your p._i._n. number 

341.48 342.51 A: right 

342.05 343.78 B: and that's how you could make money too 

343.58 352.36 A: oh yeah absolutely as you say i think it's real interesting how they do that because you know they also do like market research studies here in california you have you have those out there too 

350.25 351.27 B: uh-huh 

353.12 354.55 B: (( um )) 

354.92 356.56 B: well not really 

356.17 357.23 A: oh okay 

357.15 359.21 B: really someone told me about it 

358.87 370.64 A: yeah they do they do things not the same one as this but they do similar you know like they want feedback from the consumer like you know do you like this new thing that's out on the market and what do you think about it and and would you buy it if it was this way or that way you know that kind of thing 

370.35 372.24 B: yeah 

370.92 374.38 A: it's comp- it's like consumer you know feedback type of stuff yeah 

373.58 378.12 B: ah yeah this is just like a topic and you just have to talk about the topic for ten minutes 

377.68 379.08 A: right exactly 

378.55 382.27 B: and you get ten dollars i mean you can't beat that 

381.75 385.59 A: no no and you're you know i look at it this way i think it's really beneficial for 

385.63 400.56 A: for what the university is doing and i mean and the different you know like like i say you know when it comes down to money and friends it's just you know everybody has a different perspective of it and and i just feel like if i want to meet if i want to meet an acquaintance somewhere like at the post office and they said something to me like 

393.02 394.06 B: yes 

400.43 401.38 A: oh 

401.40 407.37 A: oh you know what um i would you know give you a million dollars you know even though i just met you today um 

407.38 417.92 A: i i wouldn't most probably talk to that person again anyway because i only knew them as an acquaintance anyway i only knew them for like a day so that would be like no skin off my nose i'd be like hey my million bucks send it on over you know 

411.69 412.90 B: (( yeah )) 

417.36 418.40 B: yes 

418.12 427.97 A: [laughter] so there but apart for as far as for my friends that i have i mean they're worth a million to me so i mean it's it's a different you know i have a different perspective of that 

423.70 424.78 B: yes 

427.84 438.67 A: but um yeah so but you know but that's interesting to hear on your hand you know because you only have different views people have different you know a different opinions in in different ways for different reasons 

438.44 439.64 B: (( yes )) 

439.31 444.96 A: and i just wish you know they said that um it was on both ends for you i mean i wish you know 

445.00 445.63 A: (( ah )) 

445.02 450.23 B: it is okay because it made me a better person it made me a stronger person you know what i'm saying because 

449.46 450.89 A: (( absolutely )) 

450.32 464.08 B: i stand alone i don't stand with nobody ah how many people can stand alone and they d- you know they need somebody they need to they need somebody to validate them they can't be by themselves they can't do anything by themselves they're waiting for a man or they're waiting for somebody 

452.71 453.58 A: right 

454.70 455.67 A: not many 

461.32 462.51 A: (( right exactly )) 

464.04 466.77 B: i'm not waiting on nobody i'll do what i've got to do

477.25 478.38 B: yes 

477.74 492.72 A: i mean as far as you know i you know i state my opinion the way the way i feel about it i don't need i don't need somebody to give me you know tell me okay well you should think this way or you should think you know you should think that way i mean i can speak for myself and i speak for the way i feel 

489.60 490.81 B: (( yes )) 

491.97 495.23 B: if a person really loves you they're going to allow you to be yourself 

494.57 499.48 A: thank- ah thank you that's exactly what i'm talking about and those are people that are down to earth 

499.22 500.43 B: yes
