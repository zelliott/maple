0.00 1.46 A: [noise] 

0.63 2.56 B: hi this is carol 

2.26 4.91 A: [laughter] hi my name's stacey 

4.39 5.39 B: hi 

5.76 8.09 B: what are your thoughts on time travel 

8.11 12.49 A: you know i have never really thought about it it's a kind of unusual subject 

10.10 11.89 B: i didn't either 

13.00 19.00 A: um so it's supposed to be if we could go back and ch- travel time and change something if we would 

17.82 18.75 B: (( yeah )) 

18.76 19.78 B: uh-huh 

19.97 23.88 A: [sigh] i don't know i probably would change something but i don't know what 

24.82 28.85 B: yeah i don't know i i know i'd change something but i don't know what either 

30.27 35.30 A: i don't know maybe i would go to school for something different than i do now than i did 

35.82 37.56 B: that's that's an idea 

39.64 40.72 A: (( i don't know )) 

41.19 45.32 A: sure i've done a lot of stupid things in my life i could change but [lipsmack] 

44.83 49.01 B: yeah or go back and get my masters maybe i would have done that instead to stay in 

51.32 53.35 A: yeah 

53.42 57.12 A: i don't know but you kind of learn something from every mistake you make so 

57.86 60.28 A: probably a good thing we can't go back and change them 

60.31 61.34 B: (( yes )) 

63.13 65.06 B: what part of the country are you from 

65.22 66.56 A: i'm in minnesota 

66.23 68.35 B: oh are you i'm in ohio 

69.84 75.77 A: yeah well i thought maybe this was done because i already got paid from some i did before 

76.58 78.53 A: so i was surprised when they called again 

78.31 80.42 B: oh that's that's good 

81.35 84.58 A: time travel well that's a hard subject to discuss for ten minutes 

84.12 85.46 B: yeah it is 

85.15 88.82 A: [laughter] [noise] 

89.35 93.81 A: maybe it could be like in those back to the future movies where you drive a fancy car to travel through time 

93.45 94.80 B: yeah 

94.26 95.09 A: [laughter] 

98.28 99.54 A: [noise] 

98.95 100.47 B: [laughter] maybe um 

102.31 104.27 B: maybe if i could do it over again 

105.38 106.69 B: (( i'd ah )) 

109.08 113.67 B: i would have probably um yeah probably gotten my masters before i got married 

114.75 116.75 B: it would have been a lot easier for me 

118.64 122.77 B: sometimes once you're married it's awful hard to go back to school after you have kids 

122.54 123.57 A: right 

123.90 125.55 B: very hard 

126.90 129.59 A: yeah i think that's probably true 

130.33 131.78 A: see i went to school 

131.87 133.48 A: um for a long time 

133.33 134.31 B: (( mhm )) 

133.55 135.18 A: before i had kids 

135.63 142.32 A: but now if i got to go back and do it all again i think i'd just go to school for nursing or something 

142.47 144.57 A: that doesn't take quite so long 

144.91 146.82 B: what did you go to school for 

145.08 147.98 A: and you still i'm a chiropractor 

147.58 149.57 B: oh that's wonderful 

148.27 149.18 A: so 

149.41 152.09 A: yeah it took almost eight years though and like 

152.29 156.46 A: a hundred and fifty thousand dollars which i'll never have paid off probably so [laughter] 

155.84 157.39 B: [laughter] 

156.61 163.18 A: and i have a friend who went to be a nurse and she just went for two years um 

163.31 166.71 A: and got became a r._n. like through a vocational school 

166.11 167.12 B: mhm 

167.15 170.88 A: and she loves her job and probably makes more money than i do 

172.45 176.58 A: [sigh] so i'm thinking that might not have been a bad plan [laughter] 

176.86 177.54 A: [laughter] 

177.31 181.42 B: [laughter] i know a lot of my friends went to nursing school and they're still all working 

185.22 186.53 A: [sigh] yeah it's 

186.61 188.86 A: hard to know what you should change if 

189.04 190.99 A: you got to go back and do it all over again 

193.08 195.50 B: yeah it sure is 

196.15 200.36 A: maybe if i could go back and change time i would have had children sooner 

200.60 207.57 A: because i just had a baby in two thousand and one and we were married um eight years before we had any kids 

207.79 208.98 B: oh that's nice 

208.05 212.93 A: because we didn't know you know we knew it would be a lot of work and wanted to kind of wait 

211.53 212.49 B: yeah 

212.95 217.29 A: and now that we have tristan i think oh well we should have done it sooner maybe 

218.81 220.27 B: yeah i was ah 

220.38 225.69 B: rather young when i had my daughter my daughter's twenty seven now i was twenty two when i had her 

227.96 230.77 B: but it was it was nice having her while i was young 

232.90 233.61 A: (( [sigh] )) 

234.26 235.93 B: i got to grow up with her 

236.70 239.00 A: well then you have enough energy to keep up with them 

239.13 240.77 B: yeah [laughter] 

239.66 240.61 A: [laughter] 

241.94 244.61 A: i'm only twenty nine so it's not like i'm really old but 

244.03 245.49 B: no you're very young 

245.43 246.44 A: still 

248.32 250.63 B: what part of minnesota are you from 

250.50 252.00 A: the southern part 

252.07 253.14 B: southern 

252.62 255.08 A: south eastern corner of minnesota 

254.67 255.91 B: mhm 

255.33 256.24 A: (( yeah )) 

256.13 259.78 B: i have a lot of relatives in um virginia minnesota 

259.79 264.35 A: okay that's kind of north we actually went to virginia once um 

264.56 266.54 A: to tour a mine up there 

266.41 267.66 B: oh really 

266.92 269.80 A: a big taconite mine or whatever 

270.58 277.09 A: and we were on vacation up there and we ran out of things to do wh- my husband wanted to go see the mine so we did that 

280.64 283.27 B: oh you guys get really cool winters like we do 

283.25 286.86 A: yeah very cold it was beautiful here today though 

286.72 288.08 B: it was here too 

289.18 294.96 A: that's what we should do is travel back in time and l- live somewhere with warmer weather [laughter] 

293.21 295.46 B: yeah that's [laughter] that's a thought 

296.61 298.36 B: that's that's a thought 

296.61 297.54 A: (( [laughter] )) 

298.08 299.40 A: [noise] 

298.79 300.37 B: i've w- always wanted to 

300.59 304.20 B: live back in florida i like florida real well 

302.29 303.31 A: yeah 

306.11 307.55 A: that would be great 

309.65 315.28 A: i don't know this time of year it's pretty nice here but i think it's going to rain tomorrow we've had a big long stretch of rain lately 

314.80 316.09 B: we have too 

316.95 319.25 B: and tornadoes and everything else 

319.06 323.09 A: yeah we haven't got any of those yet so that's good 

323.23 325.44 A: did you have tornadoes right near where you live 

325.57 329.71 B: pretty close yeah just in ah southern ohio i'm in northern ohio but ah 

329.73 334.02 B: southern ohio around columbus they had tornadoes about two hours away 

334.05 336.74 A: i know they've just had them all over lately 

341.70 347.96 A: well i hope they're done for the year i think they said that they broke records like for having more tornadoes already this year than 

348.49 349.71 A: is normal 

349.72 351.54 B: yeah that's what they said here 

352.44 354.83 B: just in ohio they broke records too 

356.05 356.75 A: um 

360.17 362.60 A: well have you done very many of these calls 

362.34 364.49 B: ah i've only done a couple of other ones 

364.59 366.80 A: yeah i did two other ones 

369.75 374.79 A: they were easier subjects though they were all about the war and stuff like that so that was 

375.65 377.19 A: easier to talk about 

378.24 383.85 B: yeah go back in time i'd like to go forward in time if i didn't age anymore [laughter] [laughter] 

383.36 384.79 A: (( yeah )) 

386.86 389.35 A: yeah it would be fun to travel forward in time 

389.10 390.05 B: yes 

391.51 394.76 A: so you could skip ahead and see what's going to happen and then come back and 

394.77 398.07 A: do things differently and change it if you didn't like it 

395.77 396.92 B: yes 

399.56 401.03 B: that's a good idea 

403.33 407.91 B: yeah but to go back in time yeah i probably would live someplace else in the country 

410.28 413.23 B: i've always wanted to someplace where it's warm all the time 

417.36 421.96 A: i think i would like that except at christmas i just feel a need to have snow at christmas 

421.43 422.37 B: (( do you )) 

422.21 423.82 A: yeah 

427.00 441.80 B: one of the best christmases i had i was six or seven years and and we went to visit some relatives in florida and i thought wow these people are really down here swimming on christmas day [laughter] you know i was so young i just thought that was the greatest i knew then i 

436.89 438.36 A: [laughter] 

441.99 444.62 B: i missed out i should have been in florida 

444.65 445.46 A: (( hm )) 

450.75 453.75 A: mm it's hard to move far away from your family though 

453.48 455.94 B: i know that's why i'm still here 

457.82 465.39 A: yeah i grew up in south dakota so i didn't move too far away but i live about five hours from where i grew up so it takes five hours to get there 

462.89 464.59 B: [laughter] oh that's not too bad 

464.96 466.64 B: yeah 

475.54 478.36 A: i wonder when else we could travel through time to 

478.52 479.78 A: [laughter] 

478.76 479.81 B: [laughter] 

481.09 486.74 A: it would be fun to travel back in time to when you were a really little kid and like see what you were like you know 

485.93 487.25 B: yeah 

488.80 494.25 B: i know sometimes things seemed so much easier when i was little and somebody else made the decisions for me [laughter] 

497.15 504.47 A: that's what i always think with my son he's not even two yet and i just think oh he has it made you know he just gets to play all day and 

504.59 508.14 A: gets cuddled a lot and gets waited on [laughter] 

507.40 508.90 B: yeah 

514.07 517.81 A: probably stressful for him though he has to learn to do a lot of things [laughter] 

517.67 519.58 B: yeah 

525.57 526.14 A: (( [noise] )) 

530.03 533.76 B: i don't think i would like to travel back in time and live in a different country though 

534.54 535.52 A: no 

535.79 537.24 B: i'm happy here 

537.40 539.55 A: i wouldn't want to travel back 

539.72 544.31 A: too many years to find it was you know harder living than it is now 

543.56 544.51 B: yes 

545.26 546.70 B: i agree with that 

549.12 550.25 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

550.97 554.03 B: i can't imagine growing up in a d- in a different country 

557.12 560.56 A: or even growing up in this country when it was like you know 

561.06 564.13 A: out in the frontier and 

564.26 568.77 A: you know no one none of the modern conveniences we have now that would be a lot harder 

567.35 568.99 B: oh that'd be terrible 

571.33 576.18 B: that's how a lot of people live over in the middle east they have no no modern conveniences 

575.70 577.70 A: yeah 

577.77 580.37 A: just like stepping back in time i'm sure 

579.85 581.01 B: mhm 

595.33 599.95 A: [noise] [noise] so have you lived there your most of your life or did you kind of move there from somewhere el-
