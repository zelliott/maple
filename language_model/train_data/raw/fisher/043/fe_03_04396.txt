24.05 25.34 B: (( yeah what i think )) 

25.47 31.81 B: yeah what i heard was that if you are if an unknown benefactor was to give you a million dollars with one stipulation

43.78 51.34 A: [laughter] i i i don't think you can sacrifice friendship for money ah er if you do it's not much of a friendship 

44.72 45.70 B: (( of ah just )) 

51.36 52.62 B: right 

52.37 54.12 A: because um 

54.16 66.24 A: [mn] speaking of friendships i have a friend of mine that i went through um high school and we went all over the country you know and everything and stood in his wedding and everything we've been buddies for 

67.35 69.59 A: fifty eight years 

69.21 70.19 B: wow 

69.75 79.57 A: i wouldn't take five million for him because [mn] if ever i need bobby all i got to do is pick up the phone and no questions asked you know 

79.36 80.33 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

79.72 92.12 A: in fact i was broke down in alabama and i told him i had a flat tyre the only thing he said is where are you and three hours later i was out of a problem 

91.35 92.69 B: wow 

92.50 95.43 A: you know and and ah to me a friend is 

95.56 102.37 A: something that ah you can't put a price on not a million dollars not a not a dollar not any dollars 

103.11 105.88 B: yeah i would i'd have to agree i mean 

106.29 112.23 B: i can't say i've had any friendship for fifty eight years but i think there's something about the principle that i could never stomach 

112.46 113.40 A: uh-huh 

113.04 114.96 B: (( and um you know i )) 

115.95 120.66 B: think it's just a a pretty shallow [laughter] proposition for somebody to accept 

121.48 123.43 B: so it's just a 

122.92 126.86 A: i guess there are a lot of people who would take less than that 

126.41 129.88 B: well probably it probably and i'm sure that you know 

128.34 140.81 A: you know but i i think it ah i think it go- goes back to how you are raised and what your you know values are and ah what your integrity is and you know it goes back a lot of things because i think 

140.84 148.24 A: whatever you ah learned at home you take with you no matter where you go in life don't you feel that's true 

146.42 147.24 B: right 

148.81 152.44 B: ah yeah i definitely agree with that i mean i think that um you 

154.98 159.49 B: know i i'm trying to think of who would a- w- what type of person would accept that kind of an offer 

159.73 161.02 A: who would 

159.96 162.79 B: and i guess somebody who's an an you'd have to be 

161.87 165.94 A: some movie star on a n- on a new york second 

165.52 167.05 B: oh yeah you know 

167.14 174.17 A: a a new york minute a movie star oh yes e- especially when they protested against the war i guarantee you 

174.73 180.76 A: they would think nothing of it 'cause that's what they ah would that's what motivates them is money 

181.22 182.23 A: (( you know )) 

182.13 183.53 B: yeah 

182.89 187.16 A: and another thing about you go to the cemetery with a truck have you 

188.16 189.65 B: i'm sorry what was that 

189.00 194.16 A: i've never seen anyone go to the cemetery with a truck following a hearse 

194.72 195.89 B: [laughter] 

195.98 196.95 A: (( have you )) 

196.84 198.69 B: (( no i can't say i have ))

204.44 210.33 A: it's crazy because ah you you you i don't know how old you are but i'm seventy three 

210.20 223.34 A: and as you get older you realise that things that you thought were so important the material things don't mean a damn thing if you you know if you've got your health and your kids are well and your grand kids are well and everything 

223.11 223.89 B: yeah 

223.24 225.96 A: you c- you can't ask for any more than that you know

235.54 238.16 A: oh okay you're just a 

238.71 252.17 A: just a youngster huh [laughter] well as you get old like me joe you get less stupid and so so it gives you some consolation in life you know [laughter] but 

240.58 242.91 B: yeah i guess so [laughter] 

250.16 252.33 B: yeah well yeah i mean i guess um 

252.95 253.82 B: (( you know )) 

254.71 258.46 B: i know it seems like i- it's actually a hard topic to talk about [laughter] because it seems 

260.04 261.19 B: so quickly 

261.42 266.41 A: it it is i mean it it's nothing to really ponder is it 

267.12 269.14 B: yeah are you still there yeah okay 

267.16 268.28 A: do you think 

269.66 272.45 A: i say it's n- nothing really to ponder 

273.24 275.26 B: yeah that's interesting 

274.19 277.04 A: it's nothing it's really a 

277.35 281.36 A: a a huh it's not much in between 

281.94 284.50 A: you don't have much room for compromise 

282.09 282.93 B: (( yeah but )) 

285.48 289.77 B: yeah it didn't sound like that there was there was compromise and i think ah yeah 

291.60 294.47 A: d- d- do you do you have a best friend 

293.86 298.91 B: ah um d- you know i i can't say i have a friend like the like the one you're describing 

298.44 299.39 A: uh-huh 

299.45 303.91 B: and um you know i i have friends but ah 

303.58 309.30 A: yeah but you're not as old as i am so you haven't had a time to cultivate a friendship that long either 

309.06 310.34 B: that's true 

310.51 311.93 A: (( you know but )) 

310.98 312.97 B: plus i've been ah you know it's a 

313.35 320.52 B: probably also because i moved away whenever i first graduated from college and came back so a lot of people were in different areas and it's just been 

320.61 324.91 B: tough ah you know developing that in terms of a friendship ah 

324.51 326.43 A: yeah 

325.23 326.73 B: and um 

326.70 331.43 A: you don't have any friendship buddies from grammer school though i guess you move around huh 

331.11 337.71 B: you know i do um but one you know i i probably haven't kept in as good a touch as i probably 

337.49 342.72 A: yeah since you would lose contact is it what you're saying huh 

337.95 340.25 B: should have and it's unfortunate 'cause you know it's 

342.19 343.64 B: (( definitely yeah yeah but ah yeah )) 

346.47 353.34 A: it it's funny how they how they ah um rekindle one you know but this maybe ah 

353.49 357.33 A: pick up the phone and call and say how you doing or something you know 

356.49 358.73 B: you know ah i agree 

358.89 367.93 A: i do that every once and a while i think about somebody and i call up you know i'll i'll trace them to find out where they are you know just to see if they're happy to still be on the planet 

368.67 369.44 B: yeah 

368.81 372.85 A: 'cause 'cause a lot of my friends aren't on this planet any more they're on another one 

372.91 374.59 B: yeah 

373.58 375.06 A: if you know what i mean 

375.75 380.77 B: i agree i mean i you know i i see people and the value of you know having friendships 

380.83 389.86 B: um that i i feel like i don't have right now and that it's definitely y- you feel like you're missing something and even without you know you know they talk about 

387.09 388.11 A: (( ah ah )) 

389.45 392.59 A: you you might meet that person today or tomorrow joe 

392.35 393.81 B: that's right 

393.14 400.19 A: you never know you know it might be somebody at work it might be somebody who just do a good turn for something you know 

400.53 405.33 B: even without it i still wouldn't take a million dollars [laughter] because of the principle it just disturbs me it's 

403.41 404.52 A: no 

405.49 406.65 A: no 

407.01 407.87 B: (( ah )) 

408.83 410.09 B: (( but you know )) 

410.84 412.39 B: i guess ah 

414.28 417.88 A: i i don't think you can put any price on friendship 

418.58 423.32 A: 'cause i don't think it's something that can be bought and the ones that can be bought you don't want anyway 

423.13 424.68 B: yeah exactly 

424.08 425.17 A: (( you know )) 

425.38 430.78 A: that's why i really feel sorry for these people that have a lot of money because they don't really know who their real friends are 

430.81 431.56 B: (( no )) 

431.31 433.22 A: they don't know if ah 

433.25 434.57 A: when they 

435.31 444.94 A: if something happens if the stock market fell or whatever and they happen to be ah destitute the next day will that person still be your friend 

445.11 448.60 B: not if they took a million dollars and left their previous best friend 

447.39 458.29 A: [laughter] will will i feel lucky 'cause i've i've had a few i haven't had a few you know and bobby's always there you know 

449.13 451.99 B: [laughter] oh it won't be counted on anymore 

453.22 454.42 B: [laughter] 

457.80 461.05 B: yeah i left it's amazing that's really great uh-huh [laughter] 

459.39 467.44 A: in in fact when when he was when year years ago the drug stores used to delivery the prescriptions you know 

467.52 477.04 A: and he had a job and he didn't have a bike and i gave him my bike and he thought i'd given him a cadillac you know and do you know to this day he still remembers that and that's 

477.71 479.47 A: over fifty years ago 

479.95 481.71 B: yeah it's amazing how 

481.71 491.00 A: its funny how things like that stick in your mind and it it it seems probably insignificant to somebody else but when you 

484.80 485.96 B: yeah 

491.00 497.18 A: think about the relationship back back through the years you know it it's crazy 

497.85 499.56 A: it's really crazy 

499.32 500.51 B: (( yeah but )) 

504.43 506.94 B: (( um to give a to manage )) 

506.96 512.19 B: to pretty much have one best friend you kind of stick ah stick it out a long time that's a long time 

511.67 519.07 A: oh yeah well i i have a few friends but that i'm i'm talking about somebody i've known for a real long long time you know 

517.85 520.09 B: yeah well that's that's cool really ah yeah 

519.48 526.98 A: and we've had our our u- u- ups and downs too and and ah it it don't all- it you know run always smooth either you know 

526.79 527.91 B: (( yeah well )) 

527.40 531.42 A: things happen you know and but we've stuck it out in 

534.38 539.06 A: fact ah we're going to have ah dinner with him and his wife next weekend 

537.67 539.06 B: (( i guess that's )) 

539.19 541.49 A: that's crazy how you do things 

542.88 547.32 A: 'cause he's got eight kids and he he's [laughter] 

547.34 550.24 A: he's got eight kids and about eleven grandchildren 

549.76 551.53 B: (( yeah [laughter] yeah oh it's amazing wow [laughter] wow )) 

551.34 559.04 A: yes it is because 'cause i didn't think he had the temperament for it like but he came through it pretty good 

562.66 570.72 A: this this survey what is it all about i don't understand it exactly is it what what's in people's minds or what 

567.17 568.03 B: (( i know ah um )) 

569.47 575.11 B: ah you know ah i don't really know a lot about it either so i guess probably just 

574.70 577.48 A: you have pick it up on a computer or something 

577.25 578.68 B: what's that

585.40 586.57 A: oh 

586.19 587.68 B: but um 

588.81 594.56 B: you know i'm guessing that they'll they'll look at how well you pick up on topics and talk with and 

593.92 597.25 A: i think it's some kind of a a speech um 

597.73 598.72 B: yeah 

597.74 598.97 A: um
