25.95 27.50 B: yeah 

26.63 29.09 A: oh my okay hypothetical okay 

30.66 35.95 A: i don't think i'd do it for a million dollars to not talk to my best friend i don't think i'd do it [laughter] 

30.74 31.39 B: (( stuff )) 

35.56 40.66 B: i don't think i would either 'cause i think [laughter] friendship's mor- worth more than 

40.82 44.38 B: money m- money can only go so far 

41.48 42.50 A: yeah 

44.22 46.39 A: yeah but it'd go awfully far 

46.10 50.77 B: yeah [laughter] yeah a new house a new car [laughter] 

46.41 47.63 A: [laughter] 

48.27 49.50 A: i don't know 

50.23 58.86 A: yeah that's right my best friend would probably do it though she'd probably say oh i'll take the million instead you know eileen you'll get over it but i want the million [laughter] 

55.47 56.42 B: yeah 

58.67 68.29 B: yeah hell you'd probably get a lot more friends having so much money but they wouldn't be but they wouldn't be true friends probably 

59.79 61.43 A: (( oh my god i don't know )) 

64.11 65.33 A: (( that's true )) 

67.35 71.52 A: yeah yeah i don't know what i'd spend a million on if i took it [sigh] 

70.44 71.63 B: i know 

72.82 75.47 B: that would be hard there's so much stuff 

75.04 78.53 A: god i'd probably go through the first probably half of it 

78.79 85.53 A: and then you know by the time i bought a house and bought a new car and paid off some bills and you know 

85.54 90.17 A: (( probably buy a car for my mom and you know stuff like that but )) 

87.75 88.82 B: yeah 

89.71 91.94 B: [noise] spend it on other people 

90.30 91.33 A: if i was 

91.35 95.77 A: smart i'd invest it and then the one million would become ten million [laughter] 

95.00 101.20 B: yeah you could you could put it in like a c._d. and live off the interest [laughter] for like the rest of your life 

99.49 100.77 A: that's right 

100.95 108.60 A: that's what my cousin did she was she had an accident and it she got ten thousand dollars and she's been living off that ever since and that was 

102.43 103.59 B: really 

107.99 109.01 B: wow 

108.83 110.05 A: nine years ago 

110.32 115.21 A: and i mean that's not that's just the interest it's not the original ten thousand 

110.33 111.60 B: wow 

115.21 117.65 B: yeah oh my goodness 

115.85 116.57 A: so 

116.99 121.16 A: i don't know my sister would take the million though she'd say forget the friend 

119.60 120.70 B: yeah 

120.89 122.00 B: i know 

121.88 124.47 A: you can make new friends and you've got your family but i don't know 

125.72 127.48 B: yeah 

126.51 130.95 A: i guess it depends on how long i've been [noise] friends with the person how long i've known them 

131.15 132.14 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

131.25 134.26 A: if they were you know i guess if they were your best friend they're 

134.61 136.02 A: you know good 

136.22 140.63 A: but if i didn't think that they'd do it for me i don't know maybe at that time i'd take the million 

136.40 137.52 B: yeah 

140.57 144.42 B: yeah i don't think that my best friend i think my best friend would take the million 

143.90 145.44 A: yeah same here 

144.83 156.23 B: maybe a couple of years ago i mean we've gotten a little bit more distant over the years a couple of years ago we were really close and but seems like we're drifting apart slowly 

150.81 151.95 A: mhm 

155.43 157.70 A: well how old are you and your best friend 

157.81 159.50 B: we're both twenty three 

159.11 161.70 A: okay yeah we're both twenty four 

161.58 162.81 B: oh wow 

162.29 165.36 A: yeah same age i thought you sounded young i was like hm 

164.75 166.58 B: yeah [laughter] 

165.47 172.04 A: this ten dollars thing for ten minutes that's not too bad you know it's the first time i just signed up a little bit ago 

168.15 170.29 B: yeah 

171.87 175.65 B: so did i i just signed up this morning [laughter] 

173.24 174.87 A: yeah [laughter] 

175.38 180.84 A: i don't know i heard they pay there so you know it's not a million but hey you it it's something 

177.92 178.81 B: yeah 

179.31 180.51 B: yeah 

180.82 183.22 B: (( yeah )) 

181.32 182.27 A: so 

182.58 185.88 A: i don't know i'm surprised it's funny we'll make phone calls 

186.21 187.67 A: for ten dollars 

187.74 189.82 A: and yet a million we'd pass up 

189.66 191.36 B: yeah oh 

190.04 192.25 A: (( threes something kinda odd about that )) 

191.59 196.10 B: yeah that that's true i didn't even think about that 

194.22 195.33 A: yeah 

195.35 200.25 A: (( i don't know i might i i wouldn't i don't know i guess if it came down to it i probably would )) 

200.28 204.42 A: i'd probably take the million that's just an awful awful lot to pass up 

200.30 201.61 B: yeah 

204.33 205.75 B: yeah it is 

204.63 211.62 A: i mean like when you when i think you know the income that people make per year and i'm like oh my gosh that's a lot that'd be nice to make that much 

211.83 212.80 B: (( yeah )) 

212.13 213.96 A: and then i'd pass up the million 

214.09 215.05 A: (( i don't know )) 

214.25 215.58 B: yeah 

215.76 219.36 B: you're right probably in the end i would take the million [noise] 

218.69 225.05 A: i'd feel awful but you know especially if i thought and i know she would see my best friend really likes the money 

220.27 221.37 B: yeah 

224.99 226.10 B: yeah 

225.26 234.89 A: so she would probably take the money over the friendship and she'd say oh well in a few years you'll forget about the money and you know i'll buy you a car and then we'd be friends again 

232.97 234.02 B: yeah 

235.35 236.16 A: but 

236.26 248.05 B: yeah it's hard i know 'cause we're looking for houses right now me and my husband and it's just hard um like i wish i say every day i'm like i wish we had so much more money we could afford a nicer house 

247.38 255.14 A: no [noise] yeah yeah but then they always say too if you had that money you know if you had enough money and you could afford just say like a eight hundred thousand dollar house 

255.16 260.02 A: you'd want to buy a one million dollar house and if you had a million you'd want to buy you know 

257.53 258.75 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah that's )) 

258.98 260.83 B: yep 

260.56 262.42 A: a hundred you know it just 

262.65 264.86 A: i guess it'd keep getting worse and worse 

264.62 266.31 B: yeah 

265.14 269.14 A: but i i don't need that much money to live i'd probably [laughter] settle for you know 

269.57 272.11 A: (( couple hundred thousand instead of a million [noise] )) 

270.67 278.13 B: yeah i know a million's like i always think that if i w- if i like had to win a lottery i'd be happy with like 

278.34 281.26 B: fifty thousand dollars and like 

279.35 280.99 A: yeah yeah 

281.23 283.02 A: than all of it yeah 

282.67 283.72 B: yep 

283.13 290.05 A: i always think about that too whether i'd take you know they say you g- you get more if you spread it out over a long period of time 

289.94 290.90 B: yeah 

290.18 291.49 A: but then you get 

291.78 294.69 A: you know you get it right away if you take the lump sum 

294.53 295.47 B: yeah 

294.86 300.37 A: so i think about that too like you know best friend a million or would i take you know twenty thousand versus 

300.73 302.22 A: three hundred thousand 

301.89 303.49 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

302.51 310.63 A: so but knowing me i'd probably take it over the long haul though you know 'cause if you're young and you know you invest it 

306.32 307.41 B: yeah 

310.70 313.57 A: you'd have a little bit coming in every year to live off of 

313.02 315.52 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

314.42 317.59 A: so the idea of not having to ever work again would be 

318.38 327.69 A: pleasing i'd be one of those people that got the million and then never worked some people go oh i got a million and i go to work every day at you know as a waitress i'm like no not me 

318.62 320.41 B: nice yeah 

321.75 322.80 B: yeah 

327.56 328.73 B: yeah 

328.13 331.59 A: invest it and live off of it and spend my time doing something else 

331.45 332.34 B: (( yeah )) 

332.43 336.93 A: so god ten minutes is a long time to talk about this [laughter] 

334.69 338.67 B: i know [laughter] i know [laughter] oh 

338.27 341.90 A: oh my god the number i we have call i._d. it came up as university of 

342.07 343.33 A: pennsylvania 

343.25 344.20 B: (( wow )) 

343.39 346.65 A: i'm thinking that's a different number than was supposed to come up and 

346.07 346.96 B: (( i kn- )) 

346.77 359.96 A: so i answered it and then it said after the beep say your name and then i heard you r name but i didn't hear a beep so i'm like is it on you know who knows whatever i guess next time i'll know [noise] you don't really have to wait did you hear a beep 

348.46 349.17 B: (( [noise] )) 

352.47 353.76 B: (( ah oh )) 

354.51 356.75 B: [laughter] 

357.78 358.97 B: yeah 

360.10 364.70 B: i did not hear a peep it just said like to introduce yourself and i was like oh okay 

365.12 366.83 A: [noise] and then you hello 

366.74 367.54 B: (( i know )) 

367.22 369.96 A: (( like there's a retard on the phone over here you know )) 

370.48 371.75 A: say hello 

371.46 373.42 B: [laughter] 

373.22 374.31 A: (( well i don't )) 

373.73 374.66 B: (( oh )) 

374.79 375.64 A: (( know )) 

374.86 381.91 B: must be at least at least it's an easier topic i thought they were going to be like these like in depth like topics but y- 

380.37 389.56 A: yeah [sigh] i mean a million dollars and a best friend that's pretty good once they start throwing at you you know like politics or something then i'm just going to hang up the phone 

382.13 384.53 B: (( yeah that's not bad )) 

384.84 385.98 B: yeah 

388.38 391.58 B: yeah oh yeah [laughter] 

393.57 395.33 B: how did you hear about it oh 

394.71 397.23 A: ((  )) 

397.25 399.40 A: like a refunding group 

399.23 400.24 B: okay 

399.64 407.80 A: and i heard [cough] i read it on there and the women i know the women that posted about it and she said it was a good idea and i said okay let's sign on 

407.96 409.06 B: yeah 

407.97 410.94 A: and they said they give you the option to hang up if 

410.99 413.88 B: if you're not interested in that topic yeah 

411.85 412.90 A: (( yeah )) 

413.27 417.78 A: yeah i mean when i heard they said the topic was a hypothetical situation 

417.80 426.92 A: and i'm thinking okay this could be any number of things hypothetically you know you cross the l- road and you get hit by a car what do you do i mean it could just be any weird thing 

420.76 421.86 B: yeah 

424.39 425.66 B: yeah 

426.76 427.92 B: yeah 

427.30 428.18 A: but 

428.30 436.29 A: then i thought well wonder who else i'm going to be talking to is it like what is the purpose of finding out what i'd do whether i take a million or have a best friend 

430.99 432.22 B: (( i know )) 

435.82 437.07 B: yeah 

436.46 439.49 A: (( you know but [mn] hey i guess you know )) 

440.24 442.17 A: it's not that hard so 

442.04 443.60 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

442.68 444.99 A: if it was five minutes it would be easier though 

444.89 447.12 B: yeah [laughter] a lot easier 

445.23 446.18 A: yeah 

447.26 459.56 A: i had no message just she just came over and she said who's that and i said i don't know and now she's looking at me like i'm nuts and i'm like talking to this person i don't know about best friends and money and you know houses and cars but 

451.38 455.42 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

455.49 456.24 B: (( yeah )) 

459.14 461.08 B: yeah 

460.78 465.61 A: i think there's maybe i think the only person that wouldn't take a million would be my mother 

465.58 466.70 B: you think 

465.88 471.99 A: she wouldn't give up her best friend for a million my sister would my dad would everybody else in my family would 

472.26 473.03 A: but 

472.28 473.94 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

473.47 481.80 A: i think they'd they'd think that maybe they wouldn't but then they think well kinda like i thought you know if you're best friend would do it then you should do it 

481.55 483.61 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

482.62 486.48 A: but you'd like to think that maybe it wouldn't happen 

487.00 493.56 B: you'd like to think uh that a lot like most people in this world would rather have a best friend than the money but actually 

487.18 488.08 A: (( i don't know )) 

493.63 499.92 B: when it comes down to it they're going to take the money friendship which is kind of sad but [laughter] 

497.23 498.13 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

499.78 502.07 A: well i guess it depends i mean i've had 

502.27 506.53 A: my best friend i've known her since ninth grade and we met in cour- 

506.72 507.62 B: okay 

506.77 509.75 A: and then like you said we've grown apart 

509.61 510.87 B: yeah 

509.83 511.94 A: ever since we've gotten out of high school [cough] 

511.95 516.25 A: we've grown apart and now she's married and i have kids and it's just like 

516.34 518.90 A: we don't we talk maybe once a month 

518.85 519.76 B: yeah 

519.08 522.21 A: i mean it's but i we still consider each other our best friends but 

522.42 525.00 A: we're just not as close as we used to be 

524.81 536.81 B: yeah and it's hard once you have children and you have your own life and it's not just hanging out and going out and having fun anymore it's you have responsibilities that'll 

525.04 525.99 A: but then 

536.64 543.02 A: yeah [mn] yeah i mean they built a house and got married and did all this stuff and i'm just like okay 

542.72 543.73 B: yeah 

543.11 550.13 A: you know i mean there's not they don't have kids and i'm not married so it's kind of like that subject there's nothing 

547.64 548.54 B: (( [noise] )) 

549.92 551.03 B: (( [noise] right )) 

550.33 561.41 A: similar and then we're not still in school anymore so i'm thinking well she would take that million 'cause that would pay off her house she'd still have [laughter] nine hundred and ninety nine left 

551.34 552.71 B: yeah 

560.60 563.59 B: [laughter] yep 

561.96 562.85 A: so 

563.12 563.93 A: (( but i don't know )) 

565.42 566.88 B: (( so you have children [noise] )) 

566.73 569.27 A: i do i have a seven and a four year old 

569.21 570.40 B: oh wow 

569.94 571.85 A: yeah they're all i was young 

571.95 572.90 B: yeah 

572.10 573.31 A: (( very very young )) 

573.56 575.92 B: [laughter] i had 

574.10 574.93 A: (( so do )) 

574.97 576.68 A: you have a baby over there 

576.52 581.85 B: i have a th- a three year old and i just had twins three months ago 

581.53 583.25 A: oh my goodness 

582.76 587.99 B: [laughter] so yeah i'm thinking like that million would do a lot for me 

586.60 587.52 A: that would 

587.55 588.82 A: that's right 

588.55 590.21 B: [laughter] 

589.03 592.89 A: [cough] i'm surprised you know i mean i'd like to think that i would 

593.16 596.27 A: stick with a friends but with having two kids 

594.74 595.85 B: yeah 

596.51 599.89 A: i mean god that would i mean that would really that'd be t-
