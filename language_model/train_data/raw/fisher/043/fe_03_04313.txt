10.31 12.08 A: nervous about it but ah 

12.10 15.55 A: we're supposed to talk about something that we would have changed 

15.13 18.70 B: yeah something that we regret or something we would have changed in the past 

18.88 21.05 A: okay so you wanna go first 

20.95 25.83 B: um sure um honestly i would have probably say i would of have 

21.77 22.62 A: okay 

25.94 35.41 B: gone ahead and [sigh] let's see something that i regretted or that i wanted to change from the past i'll say i wanted to get to know my father a little bit m- better 

32.67 33.51 A: (( what )) 

34.86 38.15 A: oh okay you didn't know your father very well 

37.86 39.64 B: no and i didn't care 

39.43 40.90 A: you didn't c- okay 

40.93 43.85 B: you know you it's one of those situations where you really don't care 

43.52 46.23 A: okay were there were there reasons for that 

46.18 49.38 B: well the reasons were because he was never really part of my life 

48.83 49.78 A: okay 

49.79 56.30 B: so because of that i didn't didn't seem all that interesting to me to have him sit there and be part of my life 

55.95 56.86 A: okay 

56.37 57.08 B: (( [noise] )) 

57.17 58.36 B: does that make sense 

57.86 63.02 A: it it does make sense um so so you regret it huh what do you what do you think that 

63.50 69.21 A: it would have changed now if you could have if you could go back and do that how would you be better off i guess 

69.59 81.95 B: probably honestly the truth of the matter is i would be more and i would be more at [mn] understanding of my own bi- ah ba- ah body and how it works and if i'm prone to diabetes or 

77.03 78.07 A: okay 

78.70 79.65 A: okay 

81.00 82.75 A: oh that kinda thing okay 

82.49 94.91 B: yeah and i also would like to know if i have any brothers and sisters if i have um a large family a small family you know what i mean it just several questions where like where certain looks of mine come from 'cause from the n- 

93.56 94.79 A: so it's more like a 

95.02 97.63 A: practic- it's a more of a practical thing 

95.06 95.92 B: huh 

97.75 102.41 A: i mean you just need to know si- more just about information about yourself not not 

102.54 107.93 A: not really sp- ah to develop any ah relationship or feelings or anything like that 

107.78 115.07 B: no i mean ah that's what i would change just to stay in contact with him to meet to know if i have brothers and sisters but not for him to be in my life 

114.49 115.40 A: okay 

115.76 122.30 B: that i don't regret but what i do regret is not at least trying to get in contact to see if i have brothers and sisters and to at least meet him 

116.81 117.60 A: okay 

121.99 122.73 A: okay 

122.13 135.95 B: 'cause ah from the nose up i look like my mom but from the body down i'm all german and since my mom is spanish and it's predominant ah obviously in the eyes in the nose and the hair i would like to ah kind of get an explanation for the other parts 

124.19 125.64 A: (( okay [laughter] )) 

127.14 128.05 A: okay 

131.69 132.92 A: right 

135.63 137.57 A: okay that makes sense 

137.51 138.24 B: yeah 

137.69 141.71 A: and that would help that would make you have more of an idea about who you are 

142.01 143.07 B: (( um it [cough] )) 

143.10 152.46 B: basically just give me comfort as to who i am not necessarily what i am or where i am or you know what i mean it'd just make me more secure and it's just something i regret [noise] 

145.29 146.16 A: okay 

148.72 149.58 A: (( yeah )) 

151.72 152.54 A: okay 

152.96 153.96 B: how 'bout you 

152.99 155.36 A: okay me um 

155.39 161.66 A: i just i totally regret screwing off in college [laughter] and ah not taking it seriously 

161.60 162.90 B: did you finish 

162.38 164.78 A: i did finish by the skin of my teeth 

164.93 166.01 A: um 

166.63 181.19 A: i i did well when i first started out and then i got totally distracted with everything else that was going on around me and the people and places and just got involved in stuff i probably you know i know i shouldn't have gotten involved in and um 

181.86 186.26 A: [sigh] just wasted years um and 

186.32 196.94 A: then i i mean i finally pulled it together enough at the end to get out um and didn't really get i mean i don't really think i got much out of it except for i mean 

196.95 205.59 A: life experiences but i don't have really anything to show for it and i also ended up having to pay a lot of money for it too so um 

206.53 207.95 A: i would really 

208.12 212.30 A: have liked to have you know go back and change that and and 

212.94 213.85 A: um 

214.35 219.06 A: maybe my life would might well hm my life would be very different now i think 

219.15 227.88 A: i'd i'd feel i i don't really i i i don't work i um i'm a stay at home mom but i might have you know had a career 

228.49 229.39 A: (( um )) 

230.26 232.29 B: but you have a degree right 

231.50 237.29 A: i do have a degree but i i don't think it really means that much because if i was to 

237.81 240.68 A: try to go back to school i i [sigh] 

240.79 242.86 A: my grades were very poor 

242.87 244.39 A: so i think that 

245.24 251.59 A: [sigh] i don't know if i could really do anything with it i think that the pay i have a piece of paper but i don't think there's much behind it 

251.88 256.35 A: because i didn't really ah [laughter] i didn't work hard i goofed around 

256.98 257.84 A: so 

257.19 260.57 B: well i can i can somewhat relate to that i went to college for about 

260.72 265.98 B: ah let's see i went to a particular p- ah um private type school very ritzy 

264.68 265.35 A: (( mm )) 

265.83 266.67 A: okay 

266.05 272.89 B: and i totally screwed around the whole time and i gave a lot of lip to my professors to where i got like basically kicked out 

272.51 273.46 A: okay 

273.26 276.10 B: in a very polite manner basically i you know 

274.62 276.45 A: i i wish that i did 

276.66 281.37 A: i really wish i did so i'd maybe sooner so i'd a had a change to 

276.98 277.74 B: you 

281.44 289.29 A: like that that happened to my brother and he had the opportunity to rethink things actually for a few years and then 

289.82 295.41 A: go back and and and learn you know and was much more mature i think i wasn't very mature 

296.49 297.35 A: so 

297.99 304.67 B: yeah but i mean i i at you also have to give consideration to regrets like that is you live as you learn 

304.24 305.98 A: right that's true 

305.34 307.07 B: so you know 

306.20 311.41 A: so is there any way that you could i mean if we go back to yours is is your father still alive 

311.37 314.82 B: yeah but he's not okay he's not an american citizen 

314.26 315.56 A: oh okay 

315.74 318.85 B: see my mother's a my mom was born in the south 

318.25 319.21 A: okay 

318.62 331.60 B: but she used to work ah she spoke spanish obviously and so because of that she would fly a a a mexicana airlines or whatever it was she's not mexican but that was just the airline that hired her and one of the pilots is my father 

321.29 322.19 A: okay 

326.11 326.98 A: uh-huh 

328.88 329.65 A: right 

331.12 332.54 A: oh okay 

332.51 337.44 B: do you hear what i'm saying so who knows where he is you know what i mean he could be in bermuda 

333.32 334.91 A: yeah yeah so 

335.52 336.93 A: you you don't even 

337.04 340.10 A: okay so you have no idea even where he is 

339.47 342.51 B: yeah so that's i mean that's my only regret 

342.75 349.88 B: pretty much i've kind of lived my life to the point where i kinda do everything at least once and if i like it i do it again if i don't like it i just don't do it again 

347.60 348.39 A: (( [laughter] )) 

349.32 352.23 A: well did did you have any con have you ever met him 

352.79 353.92 B: never 

353.33 355.52 A: no okay he does he 

355.80 358.77 A: have you talk i mean does he know you exist 

358.65 369.92 B: yes and he's never tried to make contact with me see so that's why i don't want anything to do with his life i just want to know who he is what he looks like and kind of see what i look like in the future [laughter] 

360.63 361.87 A: oh okay 

363.95 365.61 A: i understand right 

369.84 371.74 A: oh [laughter] okay 

371.75 378.54 A: does so and see if you had any ah siblings or anything like that do you have any siblings otherwise 

374.65 375.56 B: yeah 

376.11 376.83 B: ah 

378.52 380.55 B: yes i have a sister from my mother 

380.02 381.05 A: (( oh okay )) 

380.94 382.77 B: ah i mean from my father i'm sorry 

382.13 384.16 A: have you ever talked about this with your mom 

384.62 392.14 B: yeah she finally broke she finally came out she okay for my whole life she lied to me my whole life she told me that she had that he had died 

389.14 390.05 A: okay 

391.61 392.54 A: (( oh )) 

392.43 404.78 B: and then finally around what six months ago when she went into a coma and she came out of it and she was alive all of a sudden she wanted to tell me the truth so that's when i found his name and everything like that and blah blah blah blah 

396.41 397.45 A: okay 

398.71 399.70 A: okay 

404.27 405.27 A: okay 

405.04 409.06 B: but because he's not an american citizen it's hard to find him 

408.06 411.23 A: okay are you did you make an effort to do that 

411.26 425.23 B: um i've had people do it for me because i just have the money right now 'cause i'm ah first of all i'm in the middle i just finished my pharmacy technician i'm a california state board licensed pharmacy technician and i just finished that training 

421.47 422.53 A: okay 

423.77 425.36 A: oh all right so 

425.19 431.39 B: and i'm also and get this i'm also i can sometimes i'll do acting like if it's an extra work and i have a week off 

430.08 431.80 A: [laughter] okay 

431.62 435.67 B: so my job fell through and i'm so i'm doing that this week you know i'm doing that for two days 

434.98 435.92 A: okay 

435.89 439.81 B: and that does not pay as well as they it should but anyway that's a separate story 

439.18 440.49 A: yeah so 

439.89 441.80 B: um go ahead 

440.98 443.47 A: w- was it a shock to you to find that out 

443.57 445.27 B: (( ah no i've known all my life )) 

445.16 446.28 A: no but i mean 

445.46 448.61 B: i've known from the very beginning that she's lied to me 

447.60 449.94 A: oh you did how did you know that 

450.19 457.18 B: ah instinct i knew it it's almost like when you know like if you have a child you know if your child is hurt 

450.97 452.05 A: instinct 

454.66 455.75 A: right 

456.47 457.40 A: okay 

457.41 463.27 B: it's kind of like that sixth sense you just go well something's not right here if he's dead why also i kept asking her 

462.99 463.97 A: okay 

463.88 468.85 B: and you know the more you ask questions the more that they start to mess up on their answers 

468.55 469.87 A: yeah that's true 

469.79 482.26 B: and the names started to kind of change and then one day when i visited for my sister's wedding back home in louisiana i ran into my aunt and my aunt was telling me that his name was carlos and that she had that one of her friends had seen him 

481.99 482.88 A: okay 

483.82 495.60 B: and i went he's alive and she goes yeah and she goes you didn't know that i go no and to this and we what really made me mad is that everyone even my stepfather knew that he was alive 

491.37 492.16 A: mhm 

496.48 499.43 A: [sigh] so everyone was keeping a secret from you 

497.16 501.85 B: and i can't stand my yeah and i can't stand my stepfather 

501.27 502.17 A: okay 

502.98 508.35 B: and so the fact that he knew more than i did just threw me for a loop i was just so livid 

506.22 509.13 A: well here's the only thing that i can say 

509.21 511.35 A: if everybody lied to you 

511.62 517.06 A: okay you don't know if he if your fa- actual father was lied to 

512.41 513.26 B: (( mhm )) 

517.77 518.84 A: about you 

519.52 528.69 B: well no my mom told me the truth about that she told me is that he knew that i was born and that they had been with each other for two and a half years she was pregnant with me and he didn't want anything to do with me 

521.64 522.50 A: okay 

525.05 526.00 A: okay 

528.12 529.03 A: okay 

529.18 532.73 B: but that could have been through stupidity or whatever i don't care what his motives are 

532.05 532.98 A: right 

532.65 544.26 B: but the fact of the matter is i don't want him as a father i don't even like my biol- you know i don't like my biological father i like my ah stepfather i just regret not trying you know what i mean 

535.59 536.47 A: right 

538.64 539.41 A: right 

539.99 540.78 A: right 

543.67 544.57 A: okay 

544.77 550.71 B: i just regret not 'cause i i've always known it's a lie so i can't sit here and say that i that i 

549.82 559.14 A: you just so it's just more a matter of just a curiosity about yours about you about your your bio the biology and and um and your um yeah 

557.82 563.03 B: yeah and i kinda wanna meet him because that will give me an idea of why my mom did what she did 

562.29 564.94 A: right oh well that yeah that makes a 

563.17 565.52 B: 'cause he obviously isn't that great of a guy 

565.23 567.91 A: okay right so why did he 

566.68 571.09 B: and i mean if he takes off on a pregnant woman i'm sorry keep go i'm i keep rambling 

569.77 572.51 A: no why would she why would she make that choice 

572.41 580.06 B: yeah why would she make that choice if i met him maybe that would answer my question and since i've known my whole life it has been a regret my whole life 

572.67 573.53 A: (( you know wow )) 

581.78 582.49 A: so 

583.21 584.59 A: how well how 

584.80 586.05 A: (( well how old are you )) 

586.40 588.03 B: i'm twenty five 

587.30 588.17 A: okay 

589.33 591.53 B: and she just told me that when i was twenty four 

591.53 593.62 A: oh that's not very good is it 

594.42 599.90 B: no and i always knew it was a lie and i could have i the thing i regret the most is just not asking my grandma
