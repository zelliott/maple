0.45 1.95 B: hi i'm rachel 

1.67 3.74 A: [noise] yes hi i'm aaron 

4.69 5.95 B: hi how are you 

5.00 5.72 A: (( do )) 

5.98 7.59 A: good h- how are you 

7.67 9.71 B: good where are you calling from 

9.56 11.09 A: from new york 

10.95 13.13 B: oh [noise] i'm in philly 

12.97 14.01 A: oh okay 

14.08 16.51 B: [noise] [noise] [laughter] so would you take the money 

14.93 15.86 A: (( so ah )) 

16.99 18.20 A: you know it's 

18.30 19.93 A: i- it's um 

20.13 29.62 A: it's a good question because i they didn't say that like i'm married so if so if they had s- phrased it if they'd said my wife 

25.30 26.17 B: uh-huh 

28.88 30.58 B: [noise] right 

29.98 43.69 A: then then i would then i probably then i wouldn't because they i don't think that's right but then they would they say just best friend then i in my mind i'm thinking now who would that be and ah i just i can't think of any of my friends' 

34.08 36.05 B: (( [noise] right [laughter] [noise] )) 

43.77 45.87 A: outside of my wife see 

45.90 46.87 A: that 

46.35 47.20 B: (( [noise] right )) 

46.81 54.15 A: that i would that i would hold because i i- i- in my life i've gone through 

54.01 59.70 A: through a long time where i've had close friends and then they've drifted apart i guess so 

58.53 59.45 B: right 

59.51 63.18 A: i guess in my mind i'd rationalize that well you know it's 

63.15 75.15 A: i- i- for for the greater good i would just be i would be ah thankful for the time i had with the friend but i could really use that money for better things 

74.86 75.80 B: right 

75.82 81.08 A: and i think it probably all my friends' would understand and probably do the same thing 

80.70 91.07 B: right [laughter] i think yeah i think that's exactly right i'm um because when i think of a best friend of course my husband is my best friend but 

81.54 83.52 A: [laughter] that's how i feel about it right 

91.30 99.77 B: i wouldn't of thought of him with how they phrased that question i would've thought of my best girlfriend from college and i think that 

99.89 103.50 B: um she would feel just the same way that i did that 

103.55 104.50 B: you know 

104.79 107.53 B: and probably be happy for me if i took that money 

107.54 112.47 B: and i i would be happy for her if she took the money of course it would be sad that you can't 

112.94 115.14 B: spend that time with them anymore 

115.92 118.19 B: i don't know it just depends it would be 

118.27 120.03 B: for me it would be a harder 

120.68 121.40 B: [sigh] 

121.78 128.92 B: because you do drift apart the same time right now my best friend and i are really close so we're in one of those times that 

129.23 133.93 B: you know one of our close times and for right now it would be a really hard decision for me 

133.99 134.91 A: (( yeah right )) 

134.18 137.45 B: as to whether to take the money or not but um 

137.65 139.24 B: i don't know hm 

139.42 140.49 A: i think it's 

140.63 151.79 A: it's funny becau- it all depends who you ask the question to because there are some people who would think well m- you know who in their lives they'd say well a million dollars is something that realistically i could i could make 

151.79 152.81 B: right 

151.96 156.57 A: and that you know by doing this that on the other hand they're for that person i think it would be a much 

156.58 159.33 A: more challenging question but for 

158.22 159.24 B: right 

159.47 169.98 A: for from all the people i know it would j- you know that that would they wouldn't know how to to earn a million dollars if you know if their life depended on it so 

169.34 170.43 B: right 

170.40 172.83 A: and and they they probably 

172.90 187.13 A: most people i know have had financial difficulties a- at various times in their life so they know what it feels like so i mean it depends if you're comfortable with what i suppose if you don't if you weren't affected by financial problems or haven't been 

176.56 177.41 B: right 

179.09 179.96 B: right 

184.30 185.17 B: right 

187.02 189.52 A: then that would be an entirely different scenario 

187.46 188.25 B: right 

189.44 192.05 B: exactly i i agree comp- 

190.82 191.93 A: (( but you know )) 

192.03 198.01 A: yeah and a million dollars is y- that's just a number picked out 'cause of i mean i suppose 

198.19 203.18 A: if they wanted to make it harder they would start coming down with that and finding if 

201.77 211.32 B: right and say and say how much what was what would your level be what would the monetary value have to be for you to not to speak to your best friend ever again 

211.13 220.55 A: right that would be a hypothetical question that that would be real- an really really challenging for me because i would then i'd have to quantify it 

211.44 212.31 B: you know 

220.23 229.48 B: then you have to contemplate how much your friend is worth you know how much your friendship is worth and and really i mean it's funny that they 

223.67 224.62 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

229.42 240.77 B: they pose this question because most people wouldn't would you know if you think about it if someone said well how much would someone have to pay you in order to not speak to your friend again if they worded it that way 

240.73 241.93 A: yeah 

241.40 244.41 B: you would say well of course i'm not gonna do that you know 

244.40 245.25 A: right 

244.68 245.50 B: um 

246.57 250.14 B: so of course i don't know they'd they have to 

250.32 261.54 B: word it exactly right in order to get people to participate in the study you know or to ask this question in order to actually have a real answer and not just say ah 

255.95 256.90 A: yeah 

261.60 264.94 B: [laughter] well [laughter] so 

265.38 270.98 A: but do you know there are times [noise] i g- i when i think about it maybe if they said if 

271.13 278.36 A: there'd if in the time would you take a million dollars if you didn't have your your best friend available to you 

278.62 283.08 A: you couldn't speak to them during the hardest the most challenging time in your life 

282.65 283.91 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

283.15 285.44 A: that you've experienced so that would be 

285.37 286.28 B: right 

285.55 293.96 A: that would again change it again because right now let's say i'm i don't feel like i need my friends' as much as i do during a different time in my life 

290.69 291.36 B: (( [noise] )) 

293.81 295.47 B: right 

294.69 296.17 A: so that would 

295.49 300.90 B: that's true it it's all it's all depending on several factors 

300.78 301.67 A: (( [noise] yes )) 

300.97 305.71 B: (( and again it would depend on whether that best friend was my spouse or not )) 

305.69 306.59 A: right 

305.98 307.94 B: or whether i was 

308.20 313.99 B: (( um i mean and and if there w- i was in a hard place in my life [noise] i may not be )) 

314.08 319.07 B: as close to someone you know it may be a thing where [noise] all my friends 

319.19 323.13 B: i mean i have several friends that can help me through a difficult time you know 

323.09 324.05 A: yeah 

325.05 326.02 B: (( ugh )) 

326.16 330.12 B: i don't like these hypothetical situation [laughter] questions [laughter] 

328.35 336.53 A: no i c- i was looking at their other questions and i i was hoping i'm getting one that wasn't because it like yesterday i also had one that i thought was 

333.27 334.49 B: [laughter] 

335.46 336.03 B: (( [noise] )) 

337.30 339.54 A: i forget exactly what it was but i 

338.39 350.06 B: oh what was it yesterday i've had tests i've had i've had several different ones actually this is my fourth call so i was kind of surprised yeah but my husband signed up on our cellphone too so um 

344.25 345.47 A: oh really 

348.99 350.09 A: oh okay 

350.09 354.01 B: maybe they meant to get him i don't know [laughter] but um 

352.03 352.75 A: (( yep )) 

352.94 353.77 A: yeah 

354.46 358.79 B: it's kind of interesting but i've gotten pets i've gotten um 

359.60 361.53 B: oh several different ones 

362.12 368.55 B: but this one [sigh] this one kinda makes you feel like a traitor if you say that you would take the money [laughter] 

366.03 366.93 A: yeah 

368.25 369.10 A: (( yeah it )) 

369.01 371.82 B: you know it just makes you kinda feel lousy 

371.90 372.83 B: [laughter] 

372.04 373.33 A: does there's 

373.55 375.70 A: there's i don't think there's any 

375.95 379.93 A: 'cause even d- no matter what you say you'll probably say well you know 

379.87 381.30 B: (( pro- [laughter] )) 

380.10 389.19 A: one way or the other y- you're y- y- even if you don't s- take the bait and if you say oh my friendship's worth th- everything to me and i would never be sell out but 

383.66 384.34 B: [laughter] 

389.39 395.15 A: i i'd i think that practically if anyone's taking part in this study and they probably need ten dollars to begin with 

393.94 396.19 B: [laughter] right [laughter] 

395.41 401.40 A: well then they're they'd certainly thought about it and then they then n- even if they thought about it it affects them 

400.91 402.32 B: exactly 

402.80 407.74 B: fully [laughter] well and i think in some way or another everybody's a sell out 

402.93 404.65 A: (( [sigh] but ah )) 

407.66 408.56 A: (( yeah a- )) 

408.01 414.33 B: i just think it n- it depends on what extent [laughter] and it just depends on the monetary value because 

414.64 418.73 B: i'm sure in some way or another everyone would sell out their best friend [laughter] 

418.55 419.53 A: yeah 

418.83 422.75 B: but and even without money you sell out your best friend 

419.72 420.28 A: (( it )) 

422.04 424.41 A: you do people do it for nothing 

424.58 429.68 B: with your time with your you know emotions with how you deal with your friends 

427.98 428.75 A: yeah 

429.80 432.52 B: there's always all kinds of ways that you can 

429.92 430.79 A: yeah 

432.96 435.09 B: sell your friendship short [sigh] 

435.42 436.29 A: yeah 

435.73 437.31 B: (( it's too bad [laughter] )) 

437.60 438.92 B: but um 

439.57 440.49 B: so 

441.17 444.50 B: oh it's hard to [laughter] think of anything more on that subject 

444.43 450.38 A: yeah a a that's a- another thing is that some of these questions are easier to fill ten minutes with than others 

450.22 451.26 B: right 

451.27 452.22 A: right 

451.58 455.18 B: right they had oh the i remember one that i had was minimum wage 

455.41 456.28 A: yes 

455.73 458.43 B: i had that i had the one about pets [laughter] 

458.54 459.78 A: i had one that one that was 

458.74 459.66 B: and 

459.86 469.50 A: is there d- was there one something in your life that you regretted and w- what would you have changed how would you have changed it another hypothetical 

467.72 468.60 B: hm 

469.76 470.75 B: boy 

470.58 471.82 A: yeah 

471.24 472.70 B: see that's good 

472.58 473.89 A: (( yeah that was good )) 

473.86 477.25 B: that's that's a good one i would i can't imagine what i would change 

477.43 478.30 A: (( yeah what )) 

477.76 478.95 B: right now 

479.84 480.98 B: (( hm [noise] )) 

481.21 483.39 B: so how did you hear about this study 

483.19 485.67 A: did well i saw it in the village voice 

485.66 486.69 B: oh did you 

486.50 488.92 A: yeah yeah but i'd i really don't know it's a 

489.14 499.09 A: you know i'm very from new york i i just am very suspicious of everything so it it just sounded too strange and i like like why do they need to hear me talk 

499.11 501.05 B: right um 

499.86 505.89 A: and and what i what could they possibly gain from from and w- how could they afford it if 

505.35 508.15 B: right just did you check out the website 

508.26 519.90 A: i all i there was just a very simple page that where i signed up but i didn't see in and i'd sort of went to the department page but i really really didn't understand what they were doing 

516.65 517.58 B: uh-huh 

519.17 521.21 B: at the university of pennsylvania 

520.94 522.16 A: yeah 

521.55 529.80 B: basically they're they're trying to analyze they're trying to set up a computer system that can analyze voices um 

529.92 534.56 B: and and can hear you talk and basically input data from that hm 

534.68 536.08 A: oh okay [noise] 

535.49 538.38 B: hi that's what i've gotten from it anyway [noise] yes

550.07 550.97 A: yeah
