35.29 36.29 B: (( ah )) 

36.33 37.12 A: (( why you )) 

38.31 40.20 A: wanna address that first

44.61 45.75 B: um 

47.58 49.33 B: can you think of anything [laughter] 

48.99 61.74 A: well i was thinking that ah one thing i would like to change ah would have been i would have went directly to college [laughter] because i didn't i started a family first and 

61.69 66.55 A: [lipsmack] starting a family kind of hinders your free time [laughter] 

62.91 67.36 B: um oh sure yeah 

66.73 69.47 A: and it's pretty much more than a full time job 

69.57 73.67 A: so then i i didn't go right away and by the time i went 

73.72 76.19 A: it just i went in segments 

76.41 80.97 A: because it just got so overwhelming every time i tried to go full time 

81.09 85.31 A: so i went part time and it took me many years to get 

85.36 87.52 A: credits and 

86.03 87.04 B: right 

87.54 92.37 A: i'm actually have returned now just to finish a bachelor's [laughter] so

94.46 98.36 A: ah well off and on for about twenty years [laughter] 

97.96 100.24 B: wow well congratulations 

98.89 99.67 A: so 

99.86 108.16 A: if i would do something different i would go back and i would go four years right away and that's what i'm [noise] encourage my children to do 

107.74 117.45 B: sure right well you know i i i give ya a lot of credit for doing it over you know and i'm sure you you know you try to raise the kids and or your kid i'm not sure how many kids you have but ah 

117.82 122.06 B: you know and going to school at the same time must be really really ah tough so 

122.54 124.73 A: right well they have um 

125.41 128.61 A: yeah as accelerated programs now 

128.26 129.12 B: uh-huh 

129.19 138.16 A: and although they're they are exactly that more accelerated um they do offer shorter classroom time 

138.61 146.10 A: um with only four hours in classroom a week so yeah it's it's kind of good 'cause you can work at your pace at home 

141.62 142.49 B: okay 

147.02 157.52 A: and that's that's good for me it works out well because i stay home and i watch my grandkids now and [laughter] um so i have not only my kids but my grandkids and 

152.97 154.43 B: oh good for you 

157.56 164.01 A: so it's kind of interesting it's [noise] and i usually use them for my subjects when i'm writing my papers [laughter] 

163.71 165.73 B: ah what did you study when you were in school 

165.98 171.47 A: well actually went um for three ah every time i needed an 

171.46 181.65 A: education for my employment purposes i would go back for like a year and a half whatever so i took accounting i was an accountant for about fifteen years 

178.72 179.51 B: okay 

182.02 186.15 A: and i just took classes whenever i didn't know how to do something 

186.87 190.39 A: and [sigh] then i went into um 

190.87 191.89 A: teaching 

192.22 193.93 A: teaching small children 

193.55 194.46 B: wow 

194.44 196.72 A: yeah real extreme [laughter] 

196.78 198.33 A: and 

198.34 201.06 A: so i went for early childhood development 

200.55 201.31 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

201.34 202.80 A: for about five years 

203.11 204.64 A: part time [laughter] 

204.81 210.01 A: and [noise] that was really interesting but then i thought this isn't really what i wanna do 

210.44 214.05 A: and so i've converted everything into a business degree 

214.66 218.48 A: and that's basically what i do now is with 

218.98 220.04 A: um 

220.92 227.10 A: and and so it was really a need i help people start businesses and start ministries 

227.21 229.91 A: and start up churches and things like that 

229.49 232.46 B: wow this jack of all trades wow 

230.49 231.44 A: yeah 

232.18 238.83 A: yeah so it's kind of like i'm kinda well rounded with the past it helps me with what i do but yet i'm 

238.93 241.15 A: trying to get more educated on what i do 

240.86 241.72 B: sure 

241.63 242.96 A: so so what's 

243.05 245.90 A: what did you go to college right outta school 

245.40 256.48 B: yeah i did and actually my i i think my thing would probably kind of relate because i i did go to college right after school but i wish actually i'd um it's kind of the opposite i wish i would have taken some time off 

256.75 261.55 B: to take yeah so [laughter] but but um maybe like a year 

256.88 259.80 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

260.52 263.13 A: it's the flipside of the coin here [laughter] 

261.89 269.31 B: yeah exactly because um well what i what happened was that i i graduated school and i i um i 

269.26 277.05 B: i majored in it's kind of strange i majored in finance and culinary arts so i did like i did the accounting stuff 

277.13 280.80 B: but then i also ah went through ah like a hospitality program 

281.11 281.88 A: okay 

281.41 285.81 B: and what i really wanted to do when i graduated school was become a chef 

286.00 294.92 B: but what i wound up doing and you know i loved that i love cooking but what i wound up doing was taking this job with um ah chase manhattan bank here in new york 

286.10 287.08 A: (( oh okay )) 

294.76 303.47 B: [sigh] and um i took it because it was offering me a really nice salary right outta school um through like a a one year training program 

300.95 301.80 A: sure 

303.80 314.85 B: so it was kinda like you know i could start out making very little money as a chef and eventually work my way up or i could you know take this great lucrative job and so i've been working now for 

314.86 323.36 B: seven years at at well now j. p. morgan chase and [sigh] i took i took about four months off and i went down to the caribbean 

323.17 327.32 B: um i took a leave of absence and i i waited tables down there and i cooked 

327.20 340.11 B: and you know bartended stuff like that and i loved it and i i just always regret that i didn't take a year or two off and just travel the world and and um i also regret that i didn't you know kind of go into what i wanted to do you know 

340.37 343.39 A: right that sounds so typical 

341.34 342.17 B: you know 

343.03 344.69 B: but i have i have you know 

343.45 349.69 A: to lot of people do that [noise] because the subsidy always beats out [laughter] you know other things 

349.50 357.88 B: yeah i mean i mean it's a i need to pay my rent and you know and it was practical and i and i it was nothing to sneeze at i mean it was a good job at at a time when 

352.44 353.32 A: right 

358.22 361.76 B: you know things weren't you know ah weren't so great so 

361.85 366.78 B: um yeah i'm happy to have a job now i mean so many people are outta work but i always think about like 

365.72 368.63 A: that's right it's real important now 

368.66 371.92 A: and um you know especially 

372.36 375.24 A: you know be kind of dangerous to 

375.29 382.61 A: switch jobs now although it seems like people don't keep jobs for their whole life now like they used to 

376.85 377.67 B: right 

381.11 382.00 B: right 

382.38 384.08 B: right 

383.36 387.27 A: so i don't know it's kind of a changing times in some 

386.25 387.14 B: right 

388.33 393.31 B: exactly so i i feel like i have you know i feel like i have like plenty of time and you know it 

393.21 399.45 B: i'm been taking a couple classes kind of like what what what you said and just trying to get back into it and maybe 

399.36 412.23 B: you know make the switch or or do something in in the field that's kinda related to maybe something in you know like with food that related to like finance who knows but um oh do you okay 

408.30 409.30 A: mhm 

409.34 411.73 A: well i love to cook and 

411.72 419.71 A: yeah we have a culinary arts college out here ah i'm trying to think of what it's called it keeps soliciting me though you know 

419.30 420.89 B: oh do they really yeah 

419.57 427.40 A: [laughter] 'cause i enquired years ago you know i wanted to go there and [sigh] i like decorating food making it really beautiful 

426.88 427.81 B: sure 

427.70 429.75 A: you know like serving it you know 

430.08 439.71 A: in a unique way or like decorating the outside of a cake to look like different things like a little house or you know whatever the occasion is 

437.14 438.21 B: oh wow 

439.27 440.17 B: sure 

440.53 444.40 A: and i work with a lot of fresh vegetables and make 

444.44 447.46 A: just make them in to looking like things 

447.54 448.43 A: you know 

448.09 449.37 B: oh is that right 

448.55 452.63 A: yeah yeah so i enjoy cooking and being creative with it 

452.64 453.63 A: um 

453.69 463.04 A: that's real interesting to me and so i had i enquired at one time about going into being you know decorative food or stuff or something like that 

462.63 466.35 B: oh and would you ever still consider that i mean is that something you wanna 

463.70 464.40 A: so 

466.27 469.94 A: i think if there came a time where i didn't [sigh] 

470.22 472.46 A: have a lot of necessity 

472.17 473.45 B: right 

472.86 474.21 A: i would do it 

474.48 475.61 A: um 

476.89 482.28 A: i don't know enough people in the industry and i think it's something you need to know people 

481.75 482.56 B: right 

483.04 485.37 A: so i don't think i could make it 

485.52 490.06 A: you know unless i spent a lot of time making ah relationships 

489.56 491.37 B: right 

490.48 503.86 A: yeah right now i'm kind of focused on a different area but yeah if i got to the point in my life where i would do that i would probably go round and try to get to know chefs of all sorts [laughter] so i think it's a real interesting art 

504.37 507.72 B: um how many grandkids do you have if you don't mind me asking 

507.74 509.70 A: i have two i have a 

508.56 509.91 B: oh that's great

521.37 522.42 B: (( sure [noise] )) 

522.49 526.83 A: and you know give 'em the values that i have 

526.24 528.43 B: right right 

527.68 534.43 A: you know even though my daughter she's followed the family values very close and she's a good girl and 

534.07 534.85 B: uh-huh 

534.97 542.71 A: that works out well but she had ended up having to work because [sigh] um her husband had got electrocuted
