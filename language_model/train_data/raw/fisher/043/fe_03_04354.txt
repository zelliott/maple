11.12 13.20 B: we're out florida and yourself 

12.37 16.23 A: florida ah i'm up here near detroit we were just down in florida 

15.98 17.48 B: oh okay 

16.60 21.76 A: few weeks be about a month ago it was cold though [noise] but it warmed up a little bit 

18.57 19.59 B: wow 

21.29 24.07 B: right and now see it's warmer than a normal summer is 

24.10 25.19 A: oh really 

24.46 29.87 B: so yeah it's in the ah eighty ah low ah to high eighties 

29.47 30.57 A: oh wow 

30.51 31.46 B: so 

31.25 36.04 A: i missed out on the good stuff i guess well i don't like it real hot so that's why i live up here in michigan 

32.64 33.85 B: (( ah ah ah ah )) 

36.19 42.75 A: although we get we get about a week usually of ninety degree plus with real humid weather which is probably what you're used to down there 

42.93 48.13 B: well yeah of course you're close to that river up there in detroit there ah rooge river or whatever 

47.11 57.82 A: [lipsmack] oh gosh roosa- roosa- ah we don't like to talk about the roose river [laughter] that's pretty dirty anyway a million dollars not to be able to talk to our best friend 

51.12 52.62 B: oh okay [laughter] 

58.01 62.20 A: ah gosh so so who's your who's your best friend 

62.06 65.54 B: well best friend is one i've had since i was about twelve 

65.33 66.39 A: uh-huh 

65.64 72.03 B: and his name is tom and that's an interesting question would i or would i not talk to tom 

72.07 82.89 B: ah for a million dollars ah that's a real tough question i can't imagine it ah that's where i'm having a problem with it far as that point ah you know 

82.71 85.07 A: if that would be the only stipulation 

85.04 86.91 B: (( that would be the only stipulation )) 

87.07 90.55 B: well i ah tom lives in ohio and i live here 

90.26 92.20 A: mm how often do you talk now 

90.67 92.29 B: (( and i haven't talked to my brother )) 

92.37 95.38 B: oh oh we talk about every three or four days 

94.97 95.91 A: uh-huh 

95.95 98.45 B: ah i have ah i'm on the long distance so 

98.48 104.50 B: ah you know it makes sense ah just give him a call and so forth but a lot of times i'm the one that initiates the calls 

104.70 106.58 A: well you got the unlimited long distance 

104.84 105.74 B: so 

106.53 116.08 B: right yeah one of those programs you know so ah but yeah ah it's an interesting question and i guess i would have to just think oop tom just died 

106.94 108.41 A: [laughter] 

116.56 118.20 A: yeah 

116.60 118.10 B: (( wow huh )) 

118.90 128.66 A: when now they said i you know that i don't know maybe i'm devious but i'm thinking they said you couldn't talk to your friend i wonder if that would mean all forms of communication 

130.20 134.07 B: well that's an interesting question i mean you could still write to him i guess 

133.20 137.43 A: you could write or email or chat online 

138.03 143.10 A: i wonder if they meant ah they didn't really specify they just said talk 

143.38 148.98 A: so i don't know what talk means in this i guess in today's world talk has a lot of meanings [laughter] 

148.35 150.30 B: right right 

149.45 163.73 A: or it could i wonder you know i guess what too they didn't say is they didn't say i guess if you got the million dollars i wonder if they would give you the million they didn't specify either whether the million came before i guess it would have to come up front 'cause they wouldn't have any way of ah 

163.94 170.26 A: you wouldn't be motivated to not talk to your friend if you didn't have the million dollars first 

169.76 170.82 B: (( correct )) 

170.25 182.91 A: so my presumption would be the million dollars would come first and then i suspect there would that's a there's no details there but i would suspect they would they would have some way of checking up as to whether you were quote talking to tom 

183.55 191.39 B: or maybe that's part of the interesting part of it they're trying to find out would you try to go round the codicil of ah you could not talk 

191.26 204.07 A: and would you i and i i was a court reporter for twenty five years so i know that just like depends on what your definition of is is [laughter] well it depends on what your definition of talk is 

191.50 192.42 B: i mean 

194.85 195.66 B: uh-huh 

199.17 200.04 B: right 

200.10 201.59 B: (( [laughter] )) 

204.20 214.01 A: you know did i talk to tom no i mean 'cause nowadays you can chat over the internet you can even talk you know talk by voice over the internet um 

212.89 215.36 B: but that would actually still be talking though i think 

214.23 225.90 A: that would be talking so i i would i would take that that that definition of talk literally as meaning voice communication over either live or over a telephone 

215.76 216.72 B: right 

225.91 226.80 B: right 

225.99 228.29 A: or maybe even over the internet i suppose 

228.36 243.24 A: but that wouldn't leave out email it wouldn't leave out chatting te- text chatting it wouldn't leave out ah you know there's all these other forms of communication so if you put those little caveats in there 

243.38 249.04 A: if if the question was very specific and then but you were able to obviously this makes an easier decision 

249.32 255.35 A: if you were able to communicate through other means with tom but not talk to tom 

255.86 263.98 A: would that change your i mean i would think that would change your ah willingness to take the million and not be able to talk to tom anymore 

265.29 273.21 B: yeah and that's that's the interesting part because as you get older ah your friends your circle of friends that you knew start dying off 

272.90 274.22 A: (( right mhm )) 

273.41 277.09 B: and so like for instance ah my sister's already died 

277.10 283.51 B: ah my mother and father are dead so what if i act like tom was dead effectively and just went on over to ah europe 

283.17 284.44 A: [laughter] 

283.83 292.20 B: ah i mean there's a lot of ramifications of that but i get a lot of pleasure out of my remaining friends but i really only have one or two 

292.30 299.53 B: that are really great friends you know the others are what you call acquaintances is how about you are you the same way 

296.62 297.61 A: mhm 

298.51 309.53 A: ah you know what it's ah it doesn't really the re- the question has real i don't have a best friend i don't really have i mean i have acquaint- i have a lot of a- you know some acquaintances i'm in a men's group ah from our church 

309.43 314.17 A: and those are you know i right now i would say those are more acquaintances really my last 

314.24 318.77 A: re- my my best friend died about oh seven or eight years ago 

319.00 320.65 A: so at this point 

319.70 321.72 B: well your case is a no brainer 

321.13 325.18 A: (( in my case i'd say yeah give me the million [laughter] )) 

323.31 327.50 B: give me the million i will never talk to my friend again [laughter] 

325.75 330.38 A: [laughter] i will never talk to my best friend again no problem [laughter] 

328.82 335.58 B: that's right i will take the money so in in that regard you have no difficulty at all in making that decision 

335.08 344.99 A: yeah i guess i i don't have anyone that i would really struggle over whether to take the you know i don't have anyone i consider such a good friend that i would actually have to think about the decision you know 

345.05 348.59 A: [lipsmack] it would be yeah sure give me you know i have no one 

348.60 359.75 A: that i yeah even if i said even if even if they made me name a quote best friend and i named someone i mean a- the the friend the quote friends that i have are all of about equal 

359.80 363.58 A: importance and i could choose any one of 'em and say 

361.04 361.98 B: (( yeah right )) 

363.87 367.72 A: sure i won't talk i won't talk to that person again 

368.39 375.86 A: [lipsmack] although it would probably mean ah not being in the group that i'm in so that i would have probably have probably have to pick someone 

375.89 377.21 A: in that group 

377.93 380.08 A: and ah are you there 

380.05 381.72 B: yes i was listening 

380.50 381.37 A: okay 

381.42 387.59 A: okay i'd probably have to pick someone in that group and probably dr- drop out of my mens group and join another one i guess [laughter] 

386.78 390.55 B: [laughter] that's a million dollars would you do that 

389.96 399.68 A: yeah yeah i i mean i suspect you know at the level of connection i have at least right now i probably i probably would 

399.76 406.49 A: i can't see anything that would say to me oh wow i just couldn't stand not talking to you know whoever again 

406.54 407.46 A: (( you know )) 

406.72 409.54 B: what ah are you currently married 

408.96 410.85 A: i'm married yep 

410.14 415.99 B: so so your wife's your best friend what they said well you know since you really don't have anybody let's say it's your wife 

415.69 416.67 A: uh-huh 

417.06 420.65 B: would you get rid of her for a million dollars that would be an interesting question 

419.58 427.68 A: [laughter] that's a whole other question [laughter] there was a time in my life not too long ago i probably would have said hell yes 

427.53 428.96 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

427.56 438.69 A: [laughter] now i'd probably although you know she's not in there's one area which is a a cons- you know a business confidant but she's not very ah 

438.49 442.68 A: [lipsmack] not very empathetic and supportive in that really 

442.72 455.64 A: ah so in that respect i don't have and that's the the thing i like to talk i guess i have the most need to talk to somebody about and she doesn't like to talk about that stuff [lipsmack] um but other than that [lipsmack] 

456.12 461.34 A: ah if it wa- if they made me choose my wife i would probably not i would probably 

461.44 468.13 A: give up the million dollars [sigh] but um other than that i don't have anyone in my life that um 

468.22 475.45 A: you know that i would you know if if i guess if a friend were also a re- i a relative like if it were my although [lipsmack] 

475.74 483.41 A: i don't know my daughter's not really a friend i guess that doesn't she doesn't qual- i mean she's i like her and we get along but i guess that i wouldn't 

483.56 496.18 A: ah consider her quote a friend and they shouldn't be there's your you know they're your kids and that's friend carries with it a whole other level of responsibility i guess at least and i haven't had a fr- like i say i haven't had a friend that i would 

496.19 499.26 A: um ah share stuff with since ah 

499.63 500.19 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

500.35 508.01 A: since this fellow passed away about seven or eight years ago so [lipsmack] yeah it's a pretty easy call for me sounds like it would be a harder call for you 

507.52 518.87 B: right right yeah it would be a harder call i guess my question would be would be would i be able to give him half the money at least you know ah to at least ah you know because ah he'd be loosing something too that i would feel 

513.18 514.04 A: (( mhm )) 

518.50 522.03 A: yeah well i guess that would be up to you it would be your money 

520.64 521.48 B: right 

521.88 528.43 B: well but you know again it almost feels like what their definition of talking is now if they'd said have no contact 

522.90 524.32 A: [laughter] 

528.21 529.41 A: right 

528.70 531.12 B: i mean that pretty well defines 

530.05 532.17 A: that would cover all the bases 

531.89 543.41 B: that would cover all the bases since they didn't go that deep they've just said no talking sure i mean ah why not i mean i go for ah you know a couple of times one or two years without talking to him 

542.80 544.18 A: mhm 

543.64 554.49 B: ah now off course is it's on a more regular basis but only because i have the the long distance that i don't have to pay for if i had to pay for a long distance deal and so forth it my go a while [laughter] 

554.36 555.76 A: mhm 

556.35 571.23 A: [lipsmack] so as long as he yeah i think since they just said talk we could probably [laughter] at least i think we could we could make a legal argument for not being ah for being able at least to email and text chatting and what other letters 

571.23 573.62 A: ah the old fashioned way i guess 

573.35 583.35 B: 'course you may just put yourself into purgatory by doing that he well y- you know can you imagine if you sent an email to your friend hey this just happening 'cause well hey this just happened i 

576.41 577.54 A: what's that 

583.27 590.72 B: i just was made president of my company or i was just made or my daughter just had a grandchild 

590.99 596.95 B: and so you may actually create a purgatory for yourself 'cause all the good news that you've passed back and forth 

597.07 599.89 B: and that is that you can't share like what
