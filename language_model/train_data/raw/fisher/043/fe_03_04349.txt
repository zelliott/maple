35.76 36.94 B: ooh 

37.99 43.74 B: i guess it would probably be i would spend more time with my sister 

43.92 47.56 B: since i'm away from home now i don't get to spend as much time with her 

48.20 51.01 B: so yeah yeah i think so 

52.14 58.38 B: but wasn't the directing question a benefactor leaves you a million dollars 

58.49 62.17 B: and ah the only stipulation is 

62.38 67.21 B: um you can never talk to your best friend again in your life would you take the million dollars 

67.04 75.10 A: oh i didn't even hear that i heard they're talking about what would you change in your life if you could go back in time [laughter] 

68.46 69.40 B: oh 

73.59 78.05 B: oh [laughter] we probably had two different prompts then uh-oh 

78.40 79.99 B: well we can talk about both 

80.38 82.46 B: what would what would you change then 

82.58 84.15 A: what would i change 

84.26 87.03 A: i don't know i think i probably would have gone into 

87.53 92.08 A: ah diplomatic service in college instead of social services are 

91.12 94.38 B: really that's what i'm in in college right now 

93.89 96.16 A: (( you really )) 

94.79 98.83 B: yeah yeah i'm a international relations major 

98.69 101.04 A: oh i think that would be great 

100.95 102.90 B: [laughter] that's wonderful 

103.10 104.04 A: [laughter] 

103.19 105.67 B: but how has social services treated you 

105.79 108.79 A: well i've retired from there so 

107.91 110.32 B: oh okay okay 

108.87 109.62 A: mm 

109.67 112.07 A: but but i liked i enjoyed it 

111.61 112.89 B: wonderful 

112.54 125.88 A: i think there was just there was so many people that you couldn't help because of regulations and so many people that didn't really need help but got it because of regulations and and that that would be very frustrating [laughter] mm 

121.19 122.23 B: right 

122.84 123.90 B: right 

125.13 128.44 B: mhm bureaucracies are frustrating 

128.60 129.65 B: [laughter] 

129.46 133.31 A: but what was this deal about the million the million dollars or 

132.53 146.57 B: i heard okay if you had an anonymous benefactor tell you that they would give you one million dollars and the only stipulation was you could never talk to your best friend again would you take the million dollars 

147.65 152.32 A: i think so [laughter] [laughter] 

148.71 161.91 B: yeah [laughter] talk is such a you know such a small world word right you know there are ways to get around it no [laughter] hm that could be a tough decision 

157.07 159.67 A: (( [laughter] )) 

160.27 169.14 A: but that doesn't mean you can't they they didn't mean that you couldn't communicate like s- say email or or whatever you just couldn't talk to them right 

167.61 168.72 B: mhm 

168.81 174.98 B: probably it didn't specify so i think that there could be loop holes there's loop holes in everything 

174.44 182.71 A: oh i think so [laughter] can always find another best friend [laughter] 

175.51 177.17 B: [laughter] 

179.10 181.49 B: exactly [laughter] exactly 

181.51 187.79 B: and a million dollars you know i i don't know about you but a million dollars wouldn't last me that long so [laughter] 

182.72 183.84 A: [laughter] 

187.50 197.35 A: well i think at this stage of my life it probably would 'cause we've reached a point where the house is paid for the kids are grown so a million dollars would last [laughter] yeah 

195.40 196.51 B: [laughter] 

196.75 203.12 B: nineteen year olds leave nineteen years leaves me impractical with the million dollars i'm like oh gosh 

201.57 207.21 A: yeah yeah the prices of today would a house costs almost a quarter of a million dollars 

207.41 215.19 B: mhm mhm exactly oh my gosh yeah that that could go fast that could definitely go fast 

209.50 210.18 A: (( um )) 

212.70 214.28 A: (( yep [laughter] )) 

214.54 220.11 A: and twenty five thousand dollars for a car i mean [laughter] 

217.43 218.74 B: (( mhm )) 

218.88 224.16 B: unbelievable how about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars for a college education 

223.91 227.43 A: ah oh that's horrible [laughter] 

225.67 229.41 B: yeah [laughter] i know oh my gosh 

229.45 232.36 B: that's crazy absolutely crazy 

232.72 235.00 B: but i don't know i think it would be 

235.72 239.50 B: i think for me it would be hard to make that decision because 

239.78 250.81 B: right now i'm at a point in my life where i don't know whether or not i'm going to be making that kind of money you know so having someone offer it to me for free 

247.13 248.58 A: right 

250.85 252.88 B: might ah might not even 

253.31 256.43 B: be that big of a temptation 

257.07 259.60 B: i don't know i think that's also like the 

259.83 267.29 B: mid western protestant work ethic that's been put into me [laughter] that you know if if i haven't slogged away for 

263.19 265.04 A: [laughter] 

267.68 271.25 B: for what i'm getting then i don't deserve to have it but i don't know 

271.69 275.71 B: i- ah it's a lot easier to say that when you don't have it sitting in front of you 

275.75 280.37 A: well that's true too but i don't know um 

280.43 283.47 A: well at your age you haven't had a friend that you've had 

283.57 286.03 A: for fifty years see 

284.71 286.39 B: very very true 

286.08 298.33 A: and at my age most of my friends half of them already are are gone they're dead [laughter] i mean you know so i mean ah to give up another one wouldn't be that hard i don't think [laughter] 

291.06 292.18 B: mhm 

292.19 293.27 B: mhm 

293.95 294.92 B: yeah 

297.46 298.90 B: yeah 

299.18 309.32 B: well plus if you had a friend for fifty years i think that it would be easier to have a friendship that didn't involve talking you know 

308.90 313.63 A: well that's true because i still i still correspond with my high school friends 

312.88 318.06 B: mhm mhm i mean so much at at nineteen relies on 

318.48 333.19 B: talking just ah just speaking to one another whereas you get to a certain point i think where other forms of communication sort of set in and you get to that comfort level where it's not words aren't really needed as much 

332.57 339.23 A: well that's true that's true because you can you almost know what they're thinking and you know all their opinions already 

338.44 343.14 B: mhm yeah exactly and it's like there's there's just this 

343.40 346.73 B: interaction that doesn't doesn't need the words 

346.88 347.75 B: so 

347.63 358.66 A: well and and also your family becomes more important than your friends you realize that your family's the only thing that's going to be with you all the time you know through thick and thin 

356.32 357.24 B: right 

357.38 360.45 B: for ever yeah that's true 

360.87 366.32 B: that's true i haven't yeah i don't know it it's interesting too because 

366.46 371.58 B: going away to college i mean i just went away to college this year so it's kind of 

371.94 378.57 B: a big change well it's really a big change in that who your best friend is sort of 

379.20 385.83 B: it depends on where you are and who you're with and um i know that i 

386.02 390.21 B: i'll stay in touch with the people that i'm with here but i don't know how long 

390.52 394.11 B: you know how long we're going to be this close and mhm 

393.80 402.86 A: [sigh] well that's true because even our old neighbors when my husband would be transferred from one place to another it's amazing how quickly the friendship dissolves 

402.20 412.84 B: right it's sad but but it's true i guess i mean friendship has a lot to do with proximity who's there who's right there with you 

402.88 403.76 A: (( [sigh] )) 

412.97 423.06 B: that's not to say that it doesn't have to do with the person's personality or how compatible you are or anything like that but i think it has a lot to do with who is around you 

422.89 424.79 A: yes that's true [sigh] 

424.58 425.55 B: so 

425.86 426.90 B: (( i don't know )) 

427.80 429.40 B: and i i mean 

429.91 431.68 B: that's that's the way that 

431.85 433.91 B: cliques develop and 

434.20 435.81 B: it's interesting 

436.04 437.55 B: (( it's very interesting )) 

436.13 443.94 A: yeah well you have these these same things in common where you're at your neighborhood your your group [laughter] 

439.41 440.77 B: mhm 

442.48 447.23 B: yeah exactly same issues that you have to deal with so 

447.87 449.68 B: it's very interesting 

449.47 456.51 A: so i don't really think it would be that hard for you to make that decision either [laughter] 

452.81 455.95 B: [laughter] true enough 

456.24 459.82 B: true enough ah one of my friends ah 

460.01 474.54 B: he he was planning out he wanted to make and outfit for me just one outfit and at the end of making this outfit he totalled up all the prices and it was nine thousand five hundred dollars so 

473.76 475.18 A: oh my goodness 

474.58 489.06 B: if i was going to dress like that i would need a million dollars oh my gosh unbelievable he writes down this four thousand dollar watch and this three thousand dollar jacket three hundred dollar shoes and oh my gosh 

479.07 480.38 A: [laughter] 

485.53 486.11 A: (( [noise] )) 

488.57 491.41 A: (( [laughter] )) 

489.97 493.37 B: i wish [laughter] oh well 

492.23 502.12 A: yeah but you think of all the money all the good things you can do with a million dollars really i mean i could go through it in a year i mean there's so many people that [laughter] 

495.76 497.41 B: (( mhm )) 

498.29 501.76 B: oh definitely just travelling i could 

501.77 502.84 B: oh 

502.93 504.04 B: gosh 

503.64 504.77 A: [laughter] 

504.56 507.03 B: i could see the world on a million dollars 

507.31 510.15 A: yeah i've seen a good part of it but [laughter] 

509.48 513.97 B: [laughter] so you could stay in one place and spend a million dollars [laughter] 

513.22 525.78 A: yeah [laughter] that's good support when my my son travels a lot and wherever he happens to be at the time that's where we take our vacation so we've seen a good part mm 

514.11 515.91 B: [laughter] 

516.29 517.45 B: gosh

550.96 551.97 B: oh 

554.40 556.19 B: (( that's just so cool )) 

555.65 563.65 A: [laughter] and it but he'd spend maybe six seven months in one place and he'd save enough money he'd go someplace else he would go 

556.21 557.42 B: (( wow oh my gosh )) 

563.40 565.33 B: that's so amazing
