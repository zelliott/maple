45.70 50.05 A: i know you can always make new friends

51.21 52.43 A: i'm sorry 

52.41 54.71 B: your friend is going to 

54.73 56.88 B: friendship is not permanent anyway 

57.39 58.74 B: you know what i mean they could 

57.74 59.59 A: i don't know i think it is 

59.49 63.84 B: [laughter] maybe you're right [laughter] it depends on the friend do you know what i mean 

63.19 64.51 A: yeah of course 

64.36 67.00 B: i mean at my spot right now i don't know 

65.54 70.79 A: (( yeah )) 

67.45 68.76 B: i think i could 

69.08 75.11 B: sacrifice my best friend for a million dollars yeah they're not going to die i mean well couldn't we 

72.35 73.13 A: (( ah )) 

74.02 76.22 A: oh no i know they're not going to die 

75.77 77.85 B: couldn't i ah 

78.00 79.97 B: write to them 

80.35 81.56 B: they didn't say 

80.42 83.49 A: well that's a form of speaking 

82.96 84.37 B: well i guess it is 

84.69 89.18 A: what they should have said is y- you can never communicate with your friend again 

88.35 91.58 B: yeah they just said speak i guess if you would miss a lot there 

90.91 93.28 A: yeah 

92.25 95.34 B: well that would certainly diminish your quality of life 

95.40 98.79 A: yeah and it would diminish the friend's quality of life also 

99.03 100.62 B: that's true 

100.85 102.64 B: you are a good friend 

102.54 104.06 A: i'm sorry 

103.29 105.33 B: you are a good friend 

105.63 113.98 A: well i ah i hope i am it would be nice i don't have a friend you know m- i don't have a best friend 

107.94 109.61 B: for saying something like that 

113.49 114.43 B: you don't 

114.30 117.07 A: other than my wife of course 

116.41 120.54 B: yeah well i have my girlfriend and i don't think that really counts as a best friend though 

120.63 126.93 A: well i don't think in the i don't think they're talking about the you know in that perspective 

126.49 131.18 B: yeah i don't think so either because if it was about my girlfriend i would say no 

131.56 134.85 A: i think they're talking about a non-related perspective 

134.44 138.02 B: yeah i think so too so what if it was your wife would you say 

138.36 140.47 A: no absolutely not 

138.44 139.91 B: you wouldn't give up your wife 

140.04 146.30 B: so why i'm i'm curious because you said you don't have a best friend but you wouldn't give up the best friend for the million dollars 

145.29 157.19 A: because friendship's important to me a a person a person in this life may only make one best friend and mine's out there somewhere 

148.04 149.99 B: but but you don't have a best friend [laughter] 

158.89 162.06 A: and i'll find him or maybe i won't find him 

162.24 166.73 A: but at least i'll have been true to where true true to the concept 

166.83 168.16 B: that's true huh 

169.48 181.06 A: well if i you know if i knew i was never going to make a a best friend i'd say sure but that may not be the case nobody nobody ever knows that for sure 

175.93 178.05 B: (( mm )) 

180.48 185.00 B: well let's say it's the best friend the the friend that's closest to you now 

186.04 190.46 A: ah i don't know who that would be yes i do too 

191.23 192.30 A: (( ah )) 

191.23 194.44 B: 'cause what if you had to give that person up for the million dollars 

195.48 196.92 A: no offence 

197.19 201.36 A: but this this friend but i'd give him up in a heartbeat 

198.61 200.26 B: (( [laughter] )) 

201.40 215.10 B: that's kind of the way i feel you see because i don't really have a person that is like that close of a friend you know what i mean because i don't think i would if i really had that kind of a friend i wouldn't it's not worth it it's just not worth it but 

210.31 213.24 A: (( yeah )) 

214.95 225.78 B: i have a friend that i would when they say best friend i think they mean the best friend that you have right now not a hypothetical best friend that doesn't ex- you know you haven't met yet i mean that's different 

220.63 222.01 A: well if that's the 

224.83 227.62 A: if that's the case then i then i would say 

227.83 229.84 A: ah yeah sure 

229.52 236.30 B: yes so you're thinking in terms of like your the best friend and that that you've ever met in your life that 

235.61 239.36 A: yeah a close relationship somebody that you would die for 

239.30 243.54 B: oh yeah well yeah i wouldn't give a billion dollars for them 

243.30 244.52 A: i wouldn't either 

244.48 250.23 B: i wonder why they why they asked this kind of question i mean it's deliberately vague what's the purpose of this 

248.79 255.71 A: i think they're trying to to ah find out the diversity in ah 

255.74 258.26 A: in ah interpretations probably 

258.03 261.87 B: maybe it's a linguistic i always thought as a linguistics study and and 

261.00 263.55 A: it it could be yes 

262.69 263.52 B: (( you know )) 

263.79 265.98 A: that would that very well could be 

266.95 273.66 B: that's interesting yeah i've never met somebody like that that i would not give up the money for because that's not really a lot of money when you think about it 

273.16 275.03 A: no it's not 

274.21 277.69 B: but it would pretty much mean you wouldn't have to work ever again 

278.55 282.76 A: no yeah y- you're right i i wouldn't want that either 'cause i 

282.92 284.58 A: i like working 

284.44 289.68 B: yeah but it would mean that you wouldn't have the pressure of of m- ah you have have to work 

287.97 295.30 A: true that's true yeah here's the here's the kicker for me i spend my life in a wheelchair 

295.71 296.68 B: really 

295.78 299.10 A: and and i don't work an outside job 

299.46 306.15 A: right now i'm sitting behind a a homemade trailer loaded with ah limbs 

306.54 308.43 A: that i'm going to cut up and make a 

308.81 311.54 A: a ah rocking chair for my wife for 

311.55 312.86 A: her birthday 

313.05 316.30 A: for that's the that's the most important work i do

318.80 320.60 B: like you're a great guy you
