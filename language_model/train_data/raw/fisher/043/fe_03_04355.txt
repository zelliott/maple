16.11 17.86 A: oh i see 

16.98 25.89 B: so i ah i grabbed the wrong i had printed it off the computer and had grabbed the one that i printed off the website itself before i got my confirmation email

25.97 30.39 B: and it didn't have my p._i._n. number and i thought hmm i wonder what this one is going to be about [laughter] 

30.21 33.36 A: ah i see [laughter] 

33.52 39.03 A: [noise] it is an odd topic or something mhm 

35.46 39.20 B: yeah so if you were offered a million dollars would you um

50.51 52.99 A: oh okay well it could be florida 

52.43 59.04 B: [laughter] ah yeah i was gonna say there's only one other state in in the united states i guess basically that's any more southern than that 

54.25 56.03 A: (( yeah )) 

58.52 62.14 A: that's true i'm actually i'm in new york right now 

59.28 60.43 B: (( ah yeah ))

67.90 76.97 A: i'm in rochester actually [laughter] yeah yeah i go to the university of rochester i'm actually i'm actually graduating on sunday so 

68.87 71.89 B: that right well how about that 

73.01 75.64 B: is that right i thought you sounded rather young 

76.34 79.66 B: really oh congratulations that's great 

77.02 77.96 A: yeah 

78.37 80.81 A: thank you yeah 

79.71 89.76 B: that's wonderful wonderful yeah my ah we we visited the area every year 'course 'course i guess we're supposed to talk about the topic here [laughter] 

83.32 84.72 A: (( [noise] )) 

85.00 86.02 A: oh yeah 

87.53 93.02 A: that's true yeah well i could i could use a million dollars right now graduating and all [laughter] 

91.32 95.32 B: really i could ima- ye- yeah i'm telling you a million dollars 

93.62 96.43 A: (( i don't know ah loosing my best friend though )) 

96.13 98.20 B: (( yeah hm )) 

98.42 99.42 A: (( ah )) 

98.45 99.41 B: i don't 

100.38 105.94 A: mm i wonder if there's there's ways to communicate with your best friend other than talking to them getting around the situation 

105.54 113.28 B: probably not i i would i would think that the stipulations would include i mean if they're going to give you a million dollars for whatever reason 

106.20 108.12 A: [laughter] no 

111.24 112.79 A: (( [noise] mm )) 

113.58 120.04 B: i guess i would have to know [sigh] their reasoning why i i would think if if that were the um 

116.55 118.85 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

120.58 122.92 B: [lipsmack] you know the the the [sigh] 

123.29 128.61 B: stipulation was that there would have to be a reason why they'd want to you to give up your best friend 

123.89 125.68 A: (( yeah )) 

128.03 129.58 A: mhm 

129.04 133.07 B: so i guess i would have to know their reason why before i would even consider it 

132.78 137.43 A: i guess they're seeing whether an amount of money can surpass friendship 

137.15 144.11 B: yeah your right 'cause ah i i i'm somewhat older than you are probably twice as old as you are 

141.77 144.97 A: mhm [laughter] ah no way 

144.49 151.95 B: [laughter] so plus i have a cold so you can't really tell exactly what part of the country i'm from but i have had a major cold so 

149.77 150.65 A: (( uh-huh )) 

151.96 154.11 B: ah flu or something but 

154.55 158.09 B: [sigh] probably at this point in my lifetime i would say 

160.39 169.49 A: i'm sure it would be probably be different for both of us you would probably keep the friendship and i would i'm gonna make many friends yeah [laughter] 

165.95 170.57 B: probably keep the money [laughter] yeah you're gonna think you could keep yeah [laughter] 

169.73 174.21 A: i'm probably gonna go to new places and everything and my friends aren't established yet 

171.78 173.52 B: [laughter] there you go 

173.48 187.71 B: yeah well that's you know actually that that kind of ah that that's good a good theory there but you know i'm that way a lot too and and the only reason i would say that is because i don't necessarily have a best friend i just make lots of friends 

177.78 179.56 A: mhm 

180.40 181.44 A: [laughter] 

187.05 189.82 A: that's true yeah i have many friends 

188.08 200.94 B: so i don't you you know i mean i have a couple of people that i confide some stuff in but i don't necessarily have a best friend i just i just basically like most people you know unless i just find that they're 

201.13 207.85 B: there there's something really evil about them or something really bad i'm i'm one of those southern folk that are really 

203.24 205.59 A: (( mhm )) 

208.26 211.12 B: open to southern hospitality i guess 

210.50 211.62 A: there you go 

211.43 212.50 B: [cough] excuse me 

212.18 213.02 A: oh 

213.41 214.25 B: (( [cough] )) 

213.90 215.25 A: bless you mhm 

215.26 216.07 B: oh 

216.63 219.17 B: but but if ah certainly if i were young 

219.39 221.54 B: you know i would probably say 

221.62 227.07 B: that i'd definitely take the money and even like i said at my age um it's just i i guess i've not 

227.77 233.32 B: i i i just don't do not consider myself to have a best friend it's just lots of friends 

231.20 234.72 A: mhm and a million dollars is a lot of money 

233.51 239.86 B: yeah and a million dollars might make might persuade me even further that i don't have any best friends 

239.62 244.55 A: [laughter] that's true sure you'd have a a bunch of best friends after that 

240.23 241.62 B: (( [laughter] )) 

242.71 247.51 B: [laughter] there you go actually you you'd be amazed i have um 

247.75 250.43 B: a cousin who's actually like my third cousin 

250.15 250.95 A: uh-huh 

250.56 260.99 B: and he won a lottery he he for for years and years and years and years he bought like ten dollars i don't know if it's ten dollars worth of lottery tickets every day or every week or whatever 

259.78 261.46 A: mhm 

261.02 263.92 B: but i mean the man was well enough off as it is 

263.99 267.31 B: but he won two point five million dollars 

266.82 268.00 A: oh wow 

267.76 272.65 B: and it we're talking like the next road over from where i am now [laughter] 

271.17 272.29 A: wow 

273.03 277.63 B: so he and he's told us before now on top of all this the man 

277.83 279.67 B: you know some people are just 

279.69 285.74 B: o- of course i would not just throw my money away anyway but some people are just um ah 

285.99 295.60 B: tight wads as we call them down here i don't know what you call them there but just you know really pinch their money well he's one of those kinds he had plenty of money to begin with not millions maybe but 

287.50 289.20 A: mhm 

295.86 298.08 B: and now you know he's just 

297.49 299.11 A: (( mhm now he's all set )) 

298.57 311.06 B: yeah he's all set and he still saves that money and and he told me no more than two or three months ago that he makes almost a hundred thousand dollars just in [lipsmack] interest or or something yeah a year [laughter] 

307.94 309.13 A: oh wow 

310.30 315.47 A: he didn't take the ah the lump sum he took the the payments over mhm 

313.74 324.57 B: ah yeah i think he took the lump sum i don't i i know it did ah cut it dramas- you know dramatically but he i think he still took the lump sum and he still had plenty of money [laughter] 

316.78 318.60 A: yeah 

319.89 321.27 A: (( there )) 

323.87 328.90 A: see that's the best thing to do is take that and then just invest it because it would be so much 

326.70 328.33 B: right that's what 

328.42 339.98 B: yeah that's what he's done he's he's he's he's invested in you know i don't know what all he's done with all of it but i know he's he's told me he makes a a good hundred thousand dollars a year just on that so 

332.87 335.99 A: [laughter] yeah 

339.38 344.01 A: you should tell him he should spend it while he's got it go on trips and 

341.31 354.16 B: yeah that's that's the thing you know he has built himself a new home out on the coast and he he'll go buy a new truck every year now and that kind of thing but he's not not you know over spending and to top it off the man is an alcoholic 

345.61 347.36 A: mhm 

353.71 354.73 A: [laughter] 

354.49 365.53 B: so i mean i'm not you know that's just life okay now back to the other [laughter] i i i think that the reason for our conversation is just to basically for them to record our conversations anyway isn't it 

355.82 359.95 A: that's not helping yeah yeah 

365.05 370.52 A: mhm i think it's it's just a starting point i don't think we have to really talk about it the whole time or 

370.12 371.95 B: oh and 

370.82 372.46 A: ah do you um 

372.79 375.10 A: do you live near emery at all 

375.04 379.55 B: ah university you mean no i live um
