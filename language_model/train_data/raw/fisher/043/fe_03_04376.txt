10.34 11.41 A: mhm 

18.96 33.41 B: what my mother use to call when my ship comes in [laughter] but ah now she has added a stipulation of not being able to speak to your your best friend for the million dollars that puts a damper on things doesn't it 

21.99 23.17 A: [laughter] 

29.31 31.04 A: i know that'd be pr- 

32.69 38.07 A: yeah i don't know my best friend's my boyfriend and i couldn't survive without talking to him 

37.69 50.65 B: ahah then that's a that's a no brainer for you [laughter] well worth a million dollars um to um hang on to your boyfriend sure well that makes good sense 

41.17 42.12 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

44.50 45.49 A: (( mhm )) 

47.48 48.69 A: yeah 

50.97 51.90 B: (( ah )) 

52.18 62.34 B: i'm ah jeeze i'm in i'm in a bad situation right now in that my best friend is um oh quite a distance away from me and um 

61.21 63.11 A: (( hm mhm [laughter] )) 

62.24 71.39 B: we haven't ah really been keeping contact with each other as much as we should so i don't know [laughter] whether he would notice if i didn't speak to him 

71.53 82.02 B: ah for the rest of our lives maybe someday it might [laughter] cross his mind that ah he misses ah talking to to old bob but i'm not sure 

81.62 88.36 A: [laughter] yeah some friendships are like that you go years without talking to each other then one day you just meet each other 

88.46 101.86 B: yeah yeah that's true that's true and i i kinda like the that type of friendship in a way that type where um somebody picks up the phone one day and you talk to somebody you haven't seen or heard from in years and years and you 

101.72 104.19 B: pick up right where you left off right 

103.46 104.52 A: mhm 

105.06 111.77 B: but ah a million dollars my gosh that's that's ah that's quite a hypothetical situation there 

110.92 118.64 A: [laughter] yeah as i said my best friend's my boyfriend and without him i wouldn't be i wouldn't have the support for half the things i do 

118.50 125.73 B: uh-huh including the spending of a million dollars [laughter] wouldn't be fun doing that alone 

119.91 120.71 A: (( [sigh] )) 

122.00 123.52 A: [laughter] 

125.84 129.79 A: well i don't know how i would get through school without him right now so 

129.58 132.12 B: oh he's ah he's helping you through school 

131.67 137.77 A: he's um supporting me he's does things like reads the text to me 

137.90 138.75 B: (( oh )) 

138.13 139.80 A: so i can remember it 

139.78 142.31 B: that's great that's fantastic 

140.60 142.29 A: (( yeah )) 

143.21 145.89 A: so without that 

145.37 147.10 B: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

147.31 148.01 A: mm 

148.05 150.12 A: but i tend to be very sentimental 

150.14 151.65 A: anyway so 

151.56 158.02 B: oh my gosh oh so what d- you would you ah have second thoughts do you think ah 

157.78 159.99 A: no because he's um 

158.34 159.28 B: no 

160.23 168.58 A: for one thing i'm fortunate he is he comes from well practically he comes from a well to do family so he already has the money 

168.30 169.51 B: (( oh )) 

169.02 175.00 A: [laughter] second of all why would i want to give up somebody who only wants the best for me 

169.55 170.54 B: (( oh well that )) 

174.81 175.85 B: uh-huh 

175.50 179.50 A: no amount of money can replace the relationship 

178.83 179.93 B: okay 

179.78 180.63 A: (( [laughter] )) 

180.29 187.19 B: no i i would go along with that i think you're in a situation where you would ah where i would definitely blow off that million dollars 

186.50 187.99 A: mhm 

187.35 188.62 B: (( and ah )) 

188.92 195.58 B: and then well you say he comes from a wealthy family [laughter] so there's no real concern there ah to boot huh 

195.02 196.39 A: (( [laughter] no )) 

195.88 196.56 B: (( so )) 

197.02 198.86 B: well that's neat 

198.25 205.75 A: but he was the one that encouraged me to go back to school to get my degree he's the one that hm helped me with the research 

202.19 203.11 B: (( mhm )) 

205.83 209.16 A: and why would i want to give up somebody who just wants the best for me 

208.80 210.18 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

211.70 219.77 B: i'm i'm rethinking as we're talking here i'm rethinking my situation ah as i said my best friend and i haven't talked to each other for a long time 

219.12 220.17 A: mhm 

219.70 230.95 B: but ah [lipsmack] unlike your boyfriend ah my friend is um is not very well off financially at all as a matter of fact i've i've had to put a few loans ah his way over the years 

229.52 230.44 A: mhm 

231.00 235.24 B: and um [lipsmack] it occurs to me that ah 

236.46 249.51 B: [lipsmack] maybe it's not maybe it's rationalization maybe it's not but ah if i did accept that million dollars even with the stipulation of not being able to talk to him i still would be able to help him out financially 

243.01 243.98 A: mhm 

249.27 250.42 A: yeah 

249.85 260.46 B: and make sure that um he was taken care of for the rest of his life 'cause right now he doesn't even have medical ah a medical plan and that worries me very much 

257.01 257.77 A: (( mm )) 

260.85 267.30 B: so um [lipsmack] i don't know maybe the best thing for him would be not to talk but to ah 

266.36 267.19 A: yeah 

268.06 274.38 B: [lipsmack] ah take the money and ah help him out as an an as as an anonymous ah 

274.48 275.72 B: donor 

275.50 281.11 A: i know one of my friends has a very rare neurological disease and that is tempting 

281.04 282.62 B: mhm 

281.82 287.85 A: but the one thing you do realize is that this person needs support more than they need money 

287.90 291.00 B: mhm mhm yeah yeah mhm 

291.91 295.61 A: there are times she can't even she went through school 

295.86 308.17 A: got h- had a triple major in college went on and got her master's and half way through her graduate degree she she has an early form of alzheimer's and she started forgetting 

307.94 309.33 B: (( oh my sounds )) 

309.83 311.19 A: yes it is 

310.47 312.21 B: (( bad what a shame )) 

312.75 318.66 A: but how could you turn your back on somebody who was there for you most of your college career hm 

318.35 319.79 B: sure sure 

321.23 325.37 B: of course not um the the stipulation that was mentioned today was that that 

326.18 333.10 B: did the girl say the ah the lady say that ah you would not be able to talk or communicate with your best friend 

332.46 334.49 A: she said talk i think 

334.00 339.02 B: ahah well then that leaves the door open for emails and ah 

337.94 338.87 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

339.12 340.73 B: [lipsmack] and letters 

341.06 347.14 B: [laughter] [laughter] i'm looking for a a ah some type of an escape clause here 

341.78 342.67 A: well 

346.63 356.50 A: [laughter] my best friend ah i had to learn american sign because she and three other friends of mine would sign around me and i couldn't figure out what they were saying 

356.86 361.08 A: so i had to take a a._s._l. to learn what they were talking about 

357.04 358.20 B: (( ah )) 

360.44 364.34 B: oh my word that's well that's interesting so you did learn signing then

365.38 366.38 B: (( that's great )) 

365.53 371.37 A: see they just drove me crazy enough that i had to learn it in order to know what they were talking about

378.07 380.24 B: means of communication for you 

379.82 381.20 A: mhm 

380.25 383.86 B: it's just like picking up a foreign language that's great 

383.64 384.47 A: yes 

387.05 388.09 B: (( so ah )) 

389.52 391.21 B: so do you

424.19 425.75 B: (( [lipsmack] mhm ))

428.33 435.02 B: [lipsmack] yeah yeah with people on the move um and ah very few people staying in one place for 

435.98 438.57 B: all of their lives the way people used to do 

438.68 440.26 B: (( ah but ah ))

479.55 488.25 A: there's a lot to recommend it i've got more friends there than i do in alabama it's just i wanted to spend some time with my grandparents and after i lost my job 

486.52 487.35 B: mhm 

488.26 490.91 A: made sense to take some time

494.44 496.23 B: mhm 

497.45 500.87 B: so this million dollars certainly would help out there though

503.54 504.48 A: but

505.39 506.37 A: no 

505.95 520.23 B: giving up your boyfriend no i don't blame you there [lipsmack] my wife was from the south and she passed away seven years ago but she she was a country girl and ah although we lived in the city she ah was always more comfortable 

520.16 523.65 B: once we got out of the city limits [laughter] 

521.93 536.25 A: uh-uh [cough] that's like me [laughter] it's odd my grandad did some research he's originally from the atlanta area and he got into researching his mother's side of the family found out that they were a tribe of cherokee 

528.97 529.85 B: uh-huh 

536.21 536.92 B: (( oh )) 

536.31 539.53 A: that came from the georgia mountains 

539.67 544.73 A: before i knew that i knew that there was an area of the mountains that i felt instinctually at home 

544.47 546.18 B: mhm 

545.23 552.93 A: um his research indicates that his gra- mother's people came from that side that area so 

552.98 555.14 A: i just tell ryan it's genetic 

555.34 557.95 A: that i feel more comfortable in the mountains 

555.38 556.41 B: (( well )) 

557.78 560.62 B: huh that's an interesting point wow 

559.82 560.69 A: mhm 

562.05 567.68 A: ah but no way is the any money worth giving up relationships people 

562.99 564.02 B: hm i'm still 

566.48 567.49 B: (( ah )) 

567.90 569.71 A: are just more important to me 

569.68 577.98 B: what about um the ah using the money if that stipulation had not been added do you have any ideas what you would do with it 

577.79 582.70 A: i would pay off all the debts from grad school i would um 

583.24 587.84 A: i went on a mission trip to this inner city mission in new orleans 

587.59 588.73 B: uh-huh 

588.23 597.93 A: and they had this big deal you could not walk on the carpet in the sanctuary it took 'em four years to save up to the two thousand dollars for the carpet 

596.54 598.52 B: oh my gosh mm 

598.19 599.90 A: and i swore i was going to buy
