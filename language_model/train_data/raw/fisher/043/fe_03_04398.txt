56.37 59.81 A: when i was little i l- i always what i would do if i had a million dollars 

60.10 64.86 A: not with the condition of course but just all the stuff about a million dollars and uh i'm 

63.57 63.89 B: right 

64.97 69.00 A: getting older and i realize i'm never going to have a million dollars but um 

69.11 69.74 A: i realize 

70.65 73.06 A: i have a whole lot of wonderful times 

73.52 75.03 A: that i could never gotten with money 

75.23 75.63 B: mhm 

75.74 78.28 A: and um most of them have to do with my best friend 

75.91 76.25 B: mhm 

78.38 78.80 B: right 

78.71 85.95 A: and my my best friend i don't know how long you've had yours but my very best friend right now the woman that i'm thinking of um i've known for seventeen years 

86.08 86.48 B: mhm 

86.39 88.75 A: and gosh that's longer than a lot of marriages 

88.85 89.85 B: right 

89.29 90.96 A: and she has always 

91.75 94.78 A: um whe- when i have something to celebrate 

94.96 98.84 A: she would she came up with a celebration when i was really in a horrible 

99.12 103.43 A: situation she would bail me out if i was feeling blue she would do something to cheer me up 

104.50 105.47 A: and 

106.40 107.77 A: i don't see how a million dollars could 

107.88 108.40 A: ever 

108.49 109.26 A: replace that 

109.58 117.60 B: yeah i guess i i guess i have to agree because my um best friend has been with me s- for like fifteen years and and i met her in a really strange situation but um 

118.47 121.09 B: we just balance each other out a- you know very well 

121.21 121.95 B: and 

122.69 127.80 B: i guess maybe if you would ask me when i was maybe seventeen or eighteen i probably would have taken the money honestly 

127.95 128.33 B: but 

129.04 133.13 A: well because you know when you're a teenager you think there's always going to be more people and more friends 

133.07 133.62 B: right 

133.73 137.86 B: right and a million dollars just doesn't go that far to being with you know 

136.20 139.17 A: well i didn't even think well you know practically speaking 

139.76 144.37 A: that's true when i was a a kid it sou- seemed like that would be enough for the rest of my life 

144.45 144.71 B: yeah 

144.96 145.42 B: oh yeah 

146.44 148.77 A: so do you think if it was a billion dollars you would do it 

146.50 146.83 B: yup 

148.84 149.24 B: no 

149.38 158.50 B: no there's just too many good memories that could never like you said they could never be replaced by money and you know y- you could probably find those memories with somebody else 

159.27 159.76 B: but 

161.08 163.70 B: i don't know i g- i guess that there's just really no 

164.04 168.72 B: no amount of money that i could put on her head (( but )) to to replace her with because 

166.60 167.20 A: mhm 

169.13 171.43 B: those memories there there's no (( amount )) of money for those memories 

171.86 172.25 B: so 

172.49 173.64 B: probably not 

173.54 176.00 A: so do you only have um do you have one 

176.46 179.00 A: friend that you consider a best friend or do you have a 

179.32 180.76 A: um like a really close 

181.21 181.89 A: two or three 

182.11 183.82 A: really good friends that um 

184.32 185.41 A: are equally as close 

200.90 202.67 B: i do she's just always not available 

202.85 208.85 B: maybe we're just not as available for each other as my best friend and i are you know she's got a very busy life and and um 

210.23 211.96 B: we're very i mean we can talk for 

213.01 215.67 B: or not talk i should say for maybe two months and still 

215.50 216.19 A: mhm 

216.02 217.76 B: go right back to it but 

218.06 218.62 B: um 

218.81 222.73 B: my best friend and i would never consider going two months without talking to her you know 

222.80 223.33 A: mhm 

222.93 223.36 B: so 

223.99 225.58 A: because it's interesting um 

226.27 227.09 A: my friend (( i was )) 

227.77 231.09 A: jeanette her name's jeanette she a friend um 

231.99 233.37 A: that she's known longer than me 

233.55 233.91 B: mhm 

238.27 239.28 A: a couple of times jeanette 

240.27 247.58 A: told me or written on a card that i was her best friend and i said well what you know what about lilly i thought lilly you've known since you were a girl and 

245.04 245.41 B: mhm 

247.85 251.06 A: um she said well lilly and i are really close and we're we're 

251.42 258.21 A: long-term friends but in terms of being able to tell you things or not have to explain things you're my best friend 

259.06 259.40 B: right 

259.28 259.83 A: and i 

260.03 260.78 A: i think that's 

262.12 263.31 A: that's true it's th- just the 

263.40 266.70 A: uh for me what makes her my best friend is just um 

266.82 267.82 A: the ultimate comfort 

268.04 268.29 B: yup 

269.10 270.07 A: and that um 

270.96 273.09 A: i'm just me i don't have to be anybody else 

273.45 274.19 B: exactly and 

273.48 282.15 A: when i'm with her i don't have to explain things especially now that we've been it's been seventeen years she knows about my old boyfriends and my family and the different jobs i've had 

279.91 280.37 B: right 

280.80 281.26 B: right 

282.62 284.79 B: you just have a you have a really good history together 

285.35 286.29 B: and that's something that 

286.48 289.06 B: t- you know like i said there's just no amount of money that could 

289.38 293.23 B: replace that history and and i have found over the years not so much in the last 

293.97 299.05 B: probably five to eight years but prior to that i would get jealous when she would start talking about somebody else 

299.19 300.29 A: oh really 

309.40 314.32 B: and she was single and and and i was single and we were just together all the time 

314.41 315.37 B: and um 

316.29 325.76 B: and then you know i i had moved away for a little bit but we still talked and everything and and of course she met other people she met other friends and it was like when she would say oh i went out with so-and-so last night and i was like ah 

326.25 335.67 B: why couldn't it have been me you know but uh you grow out of that and and uh but uh yeah it was kind of a jealousy thing so i i just know that she's always been my best friend 

336.47 336.82 B: um 

336.59 337.49 A: well um 

337.87 338.54 A: i remember when 

338.71 341.73 A: she started seeing the man that is her husband now i 

341.58 341.94 B: mhm 

342.10 343.43 A: i was a little bit jealous 

343.32 344.45 B: yes 

344.36 349.70 A: and when i started seriously dating shortly after that i started seriously dating a guy and she was downright mean to him 

350.94 354.10 A: and um she has since apologized many times 

354.20 356.60 A: i thought i'm just so s- she said i and she 

356.88 359.16 A: she didn't think she was jealous because i i 

359.47 360.25 A: confronted her with it once 

360.62 360.97 B: mhm 

360.86 364.11 A: and she just said no he just irritates me but when it was all over 

365.11 369.46 A: and said and done she said yeah i really was jealous i just really didn't want to share you i 

370.57 375.58 B: that's so funny because my girl friend she's she's dating now and 

382.74 383.39 A: yeah 

382.88 385.48 B: and she's like you just don't want me to be happy and i said truly i do but 

385.83 389.04 B: you know these guys that that your bringing up you know with me i'm they're just 

397.33 397.91 A: mhm 

398.82 401.89 B: i just know you know i i feel i know what you need and 

403.02 404.55 B: even though it might now be true 

403.77 404.79 A: you think you really do 

404.95 405.68 B: ye- 

405.99 407.33 B: probably not 

406.87 411.11 A: because because i tell m- my friend um is very very happy with her husband 

411.24 412.04 A: i've never have 

412.25 416.19 A: i would never have picked him for her and i still don't quite see 

416.79 420.98 A: why she she lighted on him to get married they've been married for ten years now and they have a child but 

420.88 421.24 B: mhm 

421.57 422.67 A: i still don't get it 

423.15 425.28 A: i like him but i don't get it 

425.39 425.87 A: um 

426.80 432.06 A: and i really don't think i would have been l- looking at that i don't think i would have been able to pick out the man for her 

432.75 433.96 B: all i know is she um 

440.86 443.49 B: well you know and so it's funny you say that too because 

453.70 454.32 B: chuckle when i 

454.59 458.47 B: when i tell her the story that you know maybe i don't exactly know what you need but 

459.32 463.70 B: i don't know i i just i just want the best and it's just hard for me to find something that's good enough for her 

464.87 467.19 A: good thing they don't let us pick for them huh 

466.87 467.98 B: oh boy 

467.49 469.55 A: i mean i would never let her pick for me either 

469.24 470.08 B: oh i know 

470.49 471.33 B: (( they have towels there )) 

472.10 474.92 B: i know believe me i know 

474.71 476.00 A: so now do you think um 

476.24 480.64 A: this is i'm i've often wondered do you think men have a- you're married i'm not um 

480.83 481.92 A: do you think men have 

482.42 484.59 A: a best friend the way that women seem to 

485.61 486.48 B: um 

486.59 488.60 B: that's (( halfway to the )) answer because my husband doesn't 

489.59 493.01 A: well i don't know a lot of men that do really but i don't i don't like to 

489.78 490.10 B: so 

492.02 492.31 B: yeah 

493.95 499.26 A: to just state it straight out that men don't i've i suspect that they don't 

495.56 496.52 B: i don't think that 

499.57 504.46 B: yeah i i don't think so i don't they get in- as far as like an intimate conversation as women do 

504.91 510.24 B: you know they're just more they're in their caves as they say you know and they just don't share those things 

510.72 513.56 B: and i guess they don't feel the need to so why do they need a best friend 

514.31 515.42 B: you know they have friends 

514.76 515.77 A: oh that's so sad 

516.19 517.15 B: so you know they just 

517.76 519.54 B: they're just not talkers like women are so 

520.06 521.70 B: they're like no we don't need that 

522.39 523.48 B: i think they have a line 

522.59 523.01 A: well 

523.59 525.16 A: men have uh said to me 

526.49 530.04 A: process women want to process things i don't want to process 

530.13 530.47 A: things 

530.69 532.81 A: i did it it's done 

532.62 534.45 B: ri- 

534.14 537.54 A: and i guess a lot of what my best friends and i do 

537.78 538.38 A: is um 

539.19 542.04 A: sort of relate things that are interesting or 

542.90 546.97 A: or exasperating or sort of curious and 

547.66 548.06 A: b- i 

548.35 554.42 A: when it it happens to me i really feel the need to to talk it over not with just anybody but with with her or with a family member 

553.19 553.80 B: right 

555.03 556.39 A: and i guess what guys 

561.60 561.98 A: thing 

562.31 562.90 B: oh yeah 

563.17 563.56 B: yup 

563.39 564.97 A: so they don't look for a best friend
