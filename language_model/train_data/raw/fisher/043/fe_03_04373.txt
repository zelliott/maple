248.64 250.68 B: i believe we have 

254.14 255.14 B: it is supposed to be ten minutes 

255.57 256.09 A: you know 

256.93 258.53 A: well i know it was hard to uh 

258.78 260.27 A: for me to decide exactly 

260.58 262.05 A: when they said best friend because 

262.46 265.58 A: i spend most of my time with my mother and so 

266.01 267.49 A: in a way she is also 

267.84 269.47 A: like my best friend you know i do 

269.58 271.43 A: uh a lot of things with her and 

272.08 276.29 A: spend time shopping with her and doing things so it was almost kind of difficult to say 

276.65 277.07 A: you know 

277.47 278.87 A: who is my best friend 

279.11 281.61 B: mh that is wonderful you still have your mom i lost 

283.00 284.98 B: uh about a year and a half ago and 

284.52 285.28 A: oh my 

286.09 287.62 B: it makes a difference to have 

288.17 291.07 B: the wise motherly contact and 

291.13 291.65 A: yup 

292.45 295.35 B: they they've learned so much and taught us so much and 

295.44 296.04 A: definitely 

297.09 300.31 B: you enjoy your time with her and stay as much as you can with her 

300.50 305.72 A: yeah well we do we do a lot we have to drive an hour to shop and so we shop together and 

306.07 306.39 A: that 

306.78 308.93 A: gives us a lot of time to spend together so 

311.16 312.31 B: well and i think that 

312.54 314.69 B: she would take that as an honor being 

315.03 315.96 A: yup 

315.27 317.86 B: you having to decide if she is your best friend or 

318.62 320.74 B: someone outside your family is your best friend 

320.46 322.50 A: yup 

323.87 325.79 B: so she lives in the same town as you 

325.71 326.06 A: yes 

326.35 329.88 A: yeah i tried to show it to her as i you know i talked to her but 

330.33 332.49 A: we have our moments our mother and daughter moments 

332.59 332.95 A: you know 

333.84 336.29 A: where we don't see eye to eye at times 

338.80 339.89 B: believe that is normal 

340.10 340.98 A: yup definitely 

341.50 344.35 B: and that's another value and i don't think they can place a 

344.76 346.55 B: tag a money tag on either 

345.94 346.88 A: yeah exactly 

348.94 351.00 B: how old was your mother when you were born
