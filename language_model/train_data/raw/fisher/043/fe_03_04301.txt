0.25 1.79 A: hello my name is tim 

2.26 4.48 B: hello tim this is john 

4.42 5.75 A: hey how's it going john 

6.36 8.42 B: oh pretty well thank you 

8.30 10.32 A: pretty well excellent excellent 

10.45 18.19 A: all right so it looks like our discussion is about ah time travel what ah you would ah change something if you can go back in time 

17.28 21.64 B: yes shall we start with ah voting for mcgovern [cough] [laughter] 

22.58 35.01 A: [laughter] yeah [laughter] good idea [laughter] i i was gonna say no but ah yeah yeah definitely [laughter] um is that the ah only thing you would change if you can go back 

24.84 26.84 B: that's what i'd like to do 

35.25 37.72 B: oh i could have a laundry list 

37.30 39.35 A: oh i'm sure it's like most people 

39.94 44.69 B: but then there's the question of whether you believe the many worlds hypothesis 

44.54 46.29 A: right 

44.85 53.04 B: which ah suggests that if ah you change something in the past you create a new future 

52.92 57.92 A: right exactly exactly mhm 

55.20 69.00 B: and then there's the question of well maybe every time we've try tr- time travel so far we've ended up back in the universe where time travel didn't work for us and we never get to see the universes 

68.98 71.71 B: where time travel actually does work 

71.48 78.63 A: right exactly exactly ah i agree a hundred percent i'd i would be afraid that if i did go back in time and change something 

78.54 81.36 A: you you don't really know what you're changing ah 

80.54 81.59 B: mhm 

81.23 96.14 A: it could be something so minute that you might change and realise ah when you come back to the present time that that little small thing that you changed had changed your life completely into somewhere where you might not wanna be so personally it's not something i would ah really wanna mess with at all 

96.57 100.84 A: even if it was something as as minute as ah voting for a different governor just as 

101.00 103.00 A: who knows things could be a lot worse 

103.72 104.54 A: so 

105.12 112.64 A: that's my ah personal opinion but if you could if you could go ahead oh 

109.28 110.29 B: i probably 

111.93 113.28 B: oh please go ahead ah 

113.23 119.04 A: i was just gonna say if you could go back in time and you could change something and not have to worry about it having a negative effect on the future 

119.33 123.74 A: pretty much something that you could change back if you wanted to is there anything that you would change 

122.80 127.04 B: um acquire better habits when i was a kid 

126.73 132.30 A: [laughter] yeah i can i can relate to that definitely 

131.57 134.28 B: ah not become a sugar junkie 

134.29 136.45 A: right right 

134.65 137.40 B: and and acquire a saving habit 

138.40 139.23 A: (( mm )) 

140.28 145.94 A: yeah definitely good one what about something in ah say american history or something along those lines something you could change 

145.78 147.85 B: oh hang george washington 

148.04 150.12 A: oh really oh okay 

149.35 152.79 B: yes ah after the revolution 

152.71 154.50 A: mhm 

152.82 158.22 B: he put us right back into non-revolutionary government with the whisky rebellion 

158.59 160.66 A: right you're absolutely right 

159.56 164.73 B: um suppressing the ah pennsylvania farmers without authority 

163.33 165.93 A: mhm 

164.78 167.62 B: or for that matter alexander hamilton 

167.79 175.36 B: and the constitutional coup that created the constitution from a perfectly good articles of confederation 

174.81 178.27 A: mhm right exactly 

177.18 179.09 B: there's two right there 

178.17 190.18 A: mhm yeah that would that would definitely be interesting to say the least you think that would have a significant change on how our government works to this day mhm 

187.51 192.61 B: ah absolutely then ah there's always ah 

192.87 197.72 B: um oh eliminating the ah william randolph hurst 

197.73 203.74 B: before he got us into an american empire with the spanish american war 

203.65 214.53 A: mhm right exactly so in your opinion should the spanish american have not have happened or 

213.76 214.94 B: um 

215.71 220.65 B: i really would rather leave revolutions to the folks who wanna have 'em 

220.28 225.47 A: right exactly no that makes a lotta sense definitely mhm 

223.69 226.79 B: but the biggest the biggest one 

226.82 228.51 B: has got to be 

229.44 232.77 B: um our intervention in world war one 

233.35 236.79 B: even churchill realised it was wrong 

235.82 240.53 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

238.00 246.58 B: ah had the americans not intervened had the americans not supplied the brits they would have come to peace churchill thought 

246.57 248.36 A: right 

246.88 249.02 B: in fifteen or sixteen 

249.25 251.57 A: mhm without our intervention 

250.62 254.04 B: and then that nas- nasty mr hitler 

252.56 256.13 A: mhm 

254.69 256.88 B: never would have had an opportunity 

257.03 262.83 A: right no i think you're absolutely right i think you're absolutely right so you 

261.73 263.76 B: so what's on your top ten list 

263.77 269.41 A: well you know i don't know if i would go back ah quite as far i think the first thing on my mind um 

269.73 273.77 A: would probably be going back and maybe ah 

274.02 280.18 A: well i would have liked to have seen the u._s. have more action in different ah different international things like i would have liked to have seen us in ah 

280.19 288.55 A: in kosovo a little bit sooner i'd like to have seen us in different parts of south america to to stop certain things and as far as the whole iraq situation 

288.67 289.69 A: um 

289.55 299.27 A: i would have liked to have seen it ah seen us ah stay outta that completely but you know then i don't know all the facts but you know that's just my opinion 

293.62 294.74 B: mhm 

299.10 312.56 A: not going back quite as far in regards to american ros- revolution stuff like that i probably wouldn't change anything and that's not because i think they did everything right i just think it's because ah well i happen to like our quality of life here in the u. s. and i wouldn't change anything to ah 

312.59 318.36 A: to jeopardize that 'cause i i really compared to how other places in the world live i really can't complain 

318.67 324.52 A: so just based on that solely does mean i you know believe in everything we've done over time so 

324.76 327.50 A: i would certainly get rid of slavery and things like that but ah 

327.69 329.43 A: otherwise you know i can't complain 

329.75 335.80 B: yeah the british solution of compensating the slave owners 

335.76 336.63 A: (( mm )) 

336.50 338.27 B: worked in eighteen twenty 

338.65 339.45 A: (( mm )) 

340.92 343.41 B: and they got rid of 

343.45 348.57 B: their dark inheritance much quicker than we did with much less problem 

346.98 348.25 A: right exactly 

348.59 357.46 A: right absolutely right now do you think time travel's something that could ever even be possible do you think there's any 

357.48 360.19 A: any particular area of science that we haven't explored enough 

360.25 361.97 A: that we might be missing out on 

360.73 367.83 B: oh certainly um we we may discover as a result of ah 

368.05 371.37 B: research into h- high energy particle physics 

370.76 373.22 A: mhm 

371.57 379.12 B: ah the super conducting super could have coughed that up i don't know we won't know till we spend the money to find out 

376.56 377.37 A: (( mm )) 

378.93 387.95 A: right exactly exactly do you think that um you know ever that much money will ever be spent on something like that do you think that there's enough people behind it 

386.40 387.99 B: (( ah sooner or later )) 

388.09 397.88 A: sooner or later yeah i can imagine that do you think that there's ah a porthole in space that would make that possible mhm 

389.17 390.16 B: mhm 

395.19 400.96 B: ah i don't know the mechanics of it ah but we won't know unless we we ah go look 

400.85 403.45 A: right exactly so 

405.57 406.35 A: (( ah )) 

406.31 414.66 A: excellent yeah i would have to say i i believe in space travel i mean i'm sorry time travel but i i think i believe something more on some part of a porthole in space 

414.42 424.58 A: where it might be possible or again something that has to do with energy i don't know about the movies or anything like that ah time travel machine or something of that sort so 

417.29 418.32 B: mhm 

424.61 429.81 A: would you ah go into the future if you had an opportunity 

429.41 434.29 B: ah [sigh] well there's almost certainly going to be indoor plumbing there so 

434.10 437.16 A: [laughter] that that's definitely positive 

435.76 436.56 B: but we 

437.29 439.36 B: but we do go into the future 

438.84 441.10 A: mhm 

439.63 441.83 B: each second at a time 

441.80 443.63 A: yeah that's true that's true 

442.94 444.95 B: already so 

444.01 445.72 A: right 

445.73 450.94 B: going into the past is much more intriguing from a possibility of improving things 

450.70 459.12 A: mhm right exactly would you ah if you did go into the past would contacting relatives of yours or your family tree be something that would interest you 

459.65 465.46 B: oh i really don't see much benefit of that ah i know what my family banyan looks like 

462.83 464.55 A: right 

465.33 467.11 A: mhm 

465.63 470.48 B: i think and ah messing with that certainly wouldn't help any 

470.30 472.74 A: [laughter] well it can certainly screw things up 

472.83 473.84 B: mhm 

473.76 476.22 A: so do you think that you'd be interested in 

474.63 475.72 B: but going 

477.07 483.09 A: ah be ah interested in finding certain similarities between you and some of your ancestors 

482.62 493.68 B: um i i don't see much point in that i'm radically different than they are as a result of having grown up in the late twentieth century 

483.93 486.30 A: maybe the way they do things and things of that nature 

488.76 491.75 A: mhm 

493.45 496.98 A: right exactly exactly that would make perfect sense 

495.34 496.40 B: and 

496.89 506.45 B: it would require an awful lotta thought on my part to figure out how to fit in in some other time further to that i'd say ah world war two 

502.63 504.75 A: right exactly 

507.05 510.50 A: right right exactly exactly 

511.59 512.16 A: (( mm )) 

512.79 518.50 A: is there any ah other countries or parts of the world that you would wanna explore in the past 

517.81 532.31 B: mhm no you got me there i haven't given much thought about it i've just looked at focal points in history and said hm now that could stand some improving ah but i haven't through about geography 

521.30 524.15 A: (( [laughter] )) 

529.11 530.88 A: (( mhm )) 

534.49 536.36 B: um 

536.76 539.49 B: nah i'd just try and screw something up good 

539.32 542.24 A: (( [laughter] screw something up good see what happens huh )) 

541.47 542.18 B: yes 

542.33 543.18 B: mhm 

542.50 545.17 A: it's good to have the opportunity ah to think about that stuff 

545.21 555.51 A: i think for me it'd probably be looking at the way the indians lived in the u. s. i think i would always find that interesting the first ah natives native americans to our continent in regards 

554.10 558.48 B: oh there's a writer you might enjoy um william 

557.00 562.41 A: mhm mhm 

558.78 559.96 B: (( saunders )) 

560.95 562.55 B: he's cherokee 

562.76 565.22 B: and has written some pretty good stuff 

565.11 570.45 A: oh okay novels and things like that ah yeah that would definitely be interesting 

567.07 567.86 B: (( yep )) 

570.37 575.67 B: including an alternate history novel the wild blue and the grey 

572.97 574.69 A: mhm 

575.61 579.37 A: mhm 

577.89 579.99 B: that'd be a good one to start with him 

579.86 593.69 A: right exactly exactly i have to wonder i have to wonder ah i was going to say in regards to history in regards to religion i wonder if you went back far enough and got rid of the church just altogether completely got rid of the church 

593.52 597.53 A: what sort of ah what sort of impact that would have on history and on the world today 

597.66 599.89 B: ah i don't think that's possible
