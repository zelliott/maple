218.22 219.34 B: oh corporate 

220.78 222.22 B: oh okay

293.85 297.86 A: i'm sure your friend would understand and i guess they would pick the friend no 

297.25 309.05 B: mhm [noise] well my friend i would have to really really look at it you know 'cause i don't have a lot of friends i have a very few select friends that i ah interact with [cough]

361.50 364.12 B: you know comes down to

365.18 366.95 B: yeah
