0.13 1.34 A: hello 

0.71 4.39 B: hi my name's my name's elizabeth 

1.63 2.58 A: hi 

3.39 5.32 A: hey elizabeth this is mark [laughter] 

5.13 11.55 B: so what would you do if you had an offer of a million dollars i personally think it's kind of a no brainer 

11.18 16.68 A: i know it's a crazy topic well i guess it depends how close you are to your best friends [laughter] 

15.63 25.73 B: well unfortunately my best friend is a person that's been so [noise] so good for me that i'm afraid i'd just have to just pretend that i never even [noise] heard that part of it 

25.74 32.43 B: heard that person bef- of that person offering me the fifty dollars bef- ah i mean the fifty the ah the million dollars before 

30.37 31.41 A: million dollars 

32.15 34.37 A: will you drop your friend for a million dollars 

33.79 43.16 B: no no no i just have to [noise] pass it i mean it would just [noise] ha- it would just be [noise] it would it would just be i mean it would [noise] it's sort of a no brainer i mean there's no way i could do that 

34.42 35.81 A: (( oh no no no no )) 

42.53 49.82 A: of course i mean it it's you know it's one of those things in the short term you have your million dollars but in the long term that goes in your you know oh 

47.65 48.63 B: right [noise] 

48.99 53.68 B: yeah i think i think the ethics of that are pretty [noise] are pretty clear [laughter] 

53.06 58.87 A: well it's weird for me because i've lay i've lived so many places and i've left a lot of best friends behind you know i can 

57.26 69.65 B: [noise] you know that's a good point you know the funny [noise] thing is is that i i actually my [noise] my best friend is somebody i've also moved around a lot as well so my best friend is the person that's not even in this living in this area but 

59.40 60.19 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

69.76 70.92 B: nevertheless 

69.80 71.80 A: (( yeah wh- wh- wh- where do you live )) 

71.34 76.00 B: um [noise] well i actually live in philadelphia where are you in are you in philadelphia or are you calling from somewhere else 

74.77 75.33 A: (( [mn] )) 

75.45 76.99 A: i'm in los angeles 

76.76 82.35 B: you're kidding i didn't realise this programme was everywhere [noise] how interesting 

79.38 83.49 A: yeah no i guess it's cross country i i i i'm from jersey originally 

82.88 85.05 B: oh really [noise] oh 

83.68 87.94 A: yeah but i got new york city so and i know phili pretty well 

87.47 89.39 B: well you know i um 

89.96 100.32 B: [noise] i i've also i'm originally from [noise] minneapolis ah saint saint paul minneapolis area but my husband is ah is a is a librarian so we moved around the [noise] country so 

92.67 94.13 A: (( [laughter] that's funny yeah )) 

94.77 95.54 A: right 

99.39 109.85 A: yeah i guess it depends like if you if you especially if you consider your husband your best friend then of course you wouldn't you know take the million dollars you wouldn't take the million dollars unless you wanted to to run away or something [laughter] but um [laughter] it 

102.89 105.28 B: yeah well there's no way [laughter] 

107.92 115.75 B: but but you brought up an interesting point and that is for a lot of us [noise] i mean we actually [noise] wind up the irony is that we wind up leaving 

116.22 125.17 B: people we really respect you know we have a have a friendship fall behind because of the vagaries of employment and you know 

118.58 119.45 A: yeah 

123.86 129.17 A: yeah and just life ch- life changes and the thing is but i consider those friends life long 

125.65 127.22 B: right exactly 

127.91 131.23 B: but see that's how i feel too i mean i 

130.37 134.29 A: i may not see them for ten years [laughter] but i consider them life long 

133.65 144.08 B: i mean i s- i talk to i talk to i talk to my friend on a regular basis so i just unfortunately i'd i'd go down you know she had we're both sort of prevented from travel by 

135.33 136.12 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

136.53 137.97 A: i talk to my friends too 

144.23 152.66 B: children and you know lack of money [laughter] family responsibilities or i'd actually we'd actually visit each other 

145.18 146.17 A: yeah 

148.12 149.05 A: sure 

152.32 160.24 A: sure well one one of my best friends i used to live in brazil and one of my best friends lives in rio and i was best man at his wedding that's how close we were 

160.44 167.53 A: and i haven't seen him in y- ah he has a kid i've never met before because i i like you i can't af- i can't afford to go down to brazil right now at this point in my life 

167.94 170.47 B: yeah yeah well brazil is kind of a 

169.86 175.52 A: but he was my best friend like my best best best friend for many years and 

171.39 172.83 B: yeah [noise] 

174.10 184.80 B: well i think this kind of thing brings out to you that you know there's there are really you know wherever we g- i i you know actually i was going to just say my it once i was kind of complaining 

184.82 193.36 B: to my cousin that i [noise] i don't know if i was complaining but somehow the subject came up and i said well i didn't really have that many friends i don't even remember if i was actually complaining 

193.07 194.61 A: [laughter] 

193.44 202.14 B: [noise] and um when she actually made [noise] a good point to me that i've never forgotten she said well you know you actually only [noise] re- really need one best friend at a time 

201.31 203.03 A: (( mm mm )) 

202.50 206.31 B: (( and i thought even [noise] at the time even when i was a kid i thought )) 

206.42 209.58 B: oh well that's a good point 

208.28 212.20 A: well is where you live like i've lived in really small towns 

211.49 212.94 B: mhm 

212.14 224.05 A: and it's easy to have one close friend and a lot of acquaintances in a big city i find it easier to have two or three really close friends because you know because everybody's so busy even your best friends sometimes you just don't see them [laughter] 

221.18 223.17 B: [noise] right right 

223.66 230.59 B: well yeah it also depends on on where you are i mean ex- exactly i i have some i have some good friends here i you know they're 

225.97 226.96 A: yeah 

230.84 231.96 B: they're not 

232.05 239.42 B: [noise] you know this one friend of mine is just somebody who's you know kind of you know how it is [noise] once in a million sort of [noise] a sole mate [noise] so you um 

237.52 238.75 A: yeah 

240.10 250.25 B: but you know it came at a wonderful [noise] time when i didn't have a you know didn't have a lot of opportunity for friendship but i have have been fortunately you know same thing here i've had 

243.05 243.91 A: sure 

248.66 249.58 A: (( good )) 

250.53 254.03 B: at least one good friend where i've moved um [noise] 

252.84 256.40 A: that's nice that's nice yeah i mean they it's a it's 

254.76 257.81 B: so so so much for money you know what 

256.66 261.30 A: it's what's that whole thing of what would you do for a million dollars you know [laughter] well what 

259.14 261.15 B: [noise] well 

261.85 268.59 B: [mn] well i do a lot but [laughter] [noise] nothing illegal nothing ah nothing that i couldn't live with myself or 

263.26 264.73 A: [laughter] 

264.92 265.77 A: (( [laughter] )) 

268.96 271.65 B: [cough] although the irony is that 

271.75 285.37 B: you know as i get older [noise] money just you know i hate to say it i mean i'd i'd love to be rich but you know [noise] what you're my god to be you know you just don't [noise] you don't live that long [noise] when it comes right down to it and what what have my 

283.03 283.96 A: yeah 

285.58 291.59 B: i just to not to bore you but my w- my dad is an interesting character he he 

291.59 301.63 B: my [noise] his family was very rich and then his mother [noise] was a widow and my dad's an artist [noise] he's also really flaky [noise] and and my [noise] grandmother was not a very firm parent 

301.66 305.55 B: and so the upshot is my dad basically spent all her money 

305.16 306.10 A: right 

305.69 309.36 B: which is the austin money that i would have inherited as well i mean he spent 

307.67 308.66 A: sure 

309.48 314.28 B: on his art and just not on women and song just kind of things that he felt he needed 

313.96 316.70 A: just living and and he didn't make any money on his own 

314.80 321.23 B: yeah just living the way he felt he needed to live and he just spent you know thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars and um 

320.02 320.99 A: right 

321.75 327.65 B: [cough] and i [cough] once my son said when i you know kind of my son got a older and he said 

327.72 331.75 B: gees mom i don't somehow it came up and he said gees mom you mean 

332.43 344.87 B: you mean what would it be like you know if if gramp hadn't spent all that money that that would mean that you'd have money and i said yeah that would you know we wouldn't be you know 'cause we always tried to live on a single income we had four kids 

337.44 338.74 A: (( [laughter] )) 

344.50 345.57 A: (( yeah right )) 

344.88 347.74 B: and i really did not want to have the kids in daycare 

347.56 349.05 A: yeah good for you 

347.92 349.19 B: and um 

350.02 354.17 B: and i said yeah francis but you know what i'd be a different person 

353.84 355.72 A: yeah they'd 

354.74 366.49 B: you know and i might not have had you [laughter] more to the point [laughter] ah yeah so i said you know i said that's kind of the irony i mean [noise] if gramps had been a rational person and 

356.61 358.19 A: yeah yeah yeah yeah 

359.12 360.88 A: [laughter] oh 

366.49 375.26 B: [noise] hadn't spent all that money and i had been a trust fund baby you know i might have seen the world very differently and that's not necessarily a good thing 

371.27 372.07 A: right 

374.94 376.38 A: yeah of course 

376.03 377.71 B: so there you go so there's 

376.91 391.83 A: well it's it's 'cause my grandmother was v- was very wealthy and i remember everybody would always fight over her money [laughter] like in a way that she's going to pay it all to taxes why doesn't she give us all that you know the x. amount of money a year tax free and this and that and i talked to her 

390.46 392.07 B: [noise] 

391.66 401.48 A: and sh- and i'd just say why don't you just spend all your money [laughter] you know forget about everybody else 'cause she knew people were fighting over her money she hated it you know 'cause it it made all of a sudden what she 

392.10 395.05 B: [noise] 

400.59 405.32 B: well definitely i think they should just give your money to charity [laughter] [laughter] 

403.34 404.61 A: yeah 

404.69 408.74 A: no or s- or or use it for yeah exactly use it at their own discretion 

407.17 409.56 B: [noise] yeah 

408.76 410.13 A: and um 

410.36 414.15 A: you know i mean people get very strange over large sums of money 

414.34 422.50 B: i know as i get older i i think that [noise] i would i would actually be happy to get money if somebody gives me money that i could then kind of 

422.68 427.54 B: give to my favorite less popular charitable [noise] enterprise you know 

426.55 431.22 A: so if you if you if you came into a lot of money you would give it away to charity 

430.09 430.96 B: [noise] 

430.74 437.35 B: ah i just you know i probably [noise] i think as as i get older i never would have said [noise] that believe me i wouldn't have said [noise] that ten years ago [laughter] i mean 

435.90 436.78 A: right 

437.20 446.96 B: after i pay off the house and the bills you know and make sure that we don't have the we don't have that much for retirement and you know make sure that we were you know properly you know we could [noise] our children wouldn't be 

439.18 440.20 A: yeah 

447.34 450.82 B: you know [noise] in in in some in debt over us [noise] i 

450.17 451.11 A: right 

450.87 459.13 B: would like you know i would like to give it to [noise] you know like my son's little school or you know various kinds of charities that aren't [noise] popu- you know quote unquote popular 

458.76 461.54 A: yeah that don't get yeah millions and millions of dollars 

460.50 468.16 B: right exactly so that would give me [noise] tremendous [noise] satisfaction [noise] but your goals [noise] change i think as you get older too 

461.91 463.10 A: but 

464.93 466.16 A: so so you 

468.03 471.93 A: this is true and i'm just about to turn forty so 

471.16 476.44 B: [noise] oh you're a baby god i can't remember when i was you know i was 

472.81 474.79 A: i'm a baby [laughter] 

476.73 482.82 B: [sigh] well i was forty about twelve years ago and it seemed so momentous [noise] and i look back [noise] and it's just like 

482.88 492.47 B: wow it was [noise] so long ago [laughter] i thought i was getting so old now i god i was so young [laughter] 

490.77 500.96 A: mhm mhm mhm well same thing with thirty you know and twenty and [laughter] you look at people who are turning 'cause i look at people turning thirty now and i'm like i'm so old [laughter] yeah right [laughter] 

493.67 494.98 B: yeah well 

499.82 513.05 B: well we had a friend who said ah made rather a humour observation as he was getting a little older and he said so gee you know when you're in your teens and your twenties you think you've got all the time in the world and then you turn thirty and then you're it's like 

513.13 518.52 B: (( thirty two thirty four thirty six he said it's like it's being shot out of a cannon )) 

514.92 515.83 A: (( yeah )) 

518.21 519.76 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

518.82 520.66 B: and i always loved that it's 

520.78 522.16 B: so true 

521.86 523.05 A: yeah it is 

524.36 527.08 B: [noise] so so much for [noise] money um 

526.57 528.03 A: [laughter] 

527.15 534.84 B: [noise] so is your are your are your needs then also satisfied by you know your job i mean you're not broke are you 

533.28 534.33 A: (( well i'm )) 

534.76 536.14 A: what's that 

535.61 541.22 B: i said in terms of not being tempted by to dump good friends for a million dollars i said 

540.35 542.61 A: no but i'm i'm in a i'm an actor 

542.33 544.10 B: oh you're an actor 

543.20 550.23 A: so ah so i'm in that crazy industry where i've made like some year's i've made six figures and some years i've made ba- barely anything 

548.97 551.46 B: (( [noise] oh funny )) 

550.86 563.07 A: and then i've had friends who've taken off and all of a sudden made a million dollars in a year [laughter] you know and and the really interesting thing is how people around them treat them 

556.03 557.12 B: gee 

562.45 564.35 B: (( mhm )) 

563.13 576.61 A: and once in a while how people start really believing what's written about them or how other people treat them and that's really str- strange to see somebody go from being somebody struggling who's like trying to get their life together to all of a sudden having two or three million dollars 

576.51 580.99 A: and acting like like they deserve it [laughter] you know 

580.35 588.89 B: yeah exactly no that's that would be a great i'm sure that would be a- another temptation which i have not god has not 

581.88 583.26 A: i've seen i've seen them 

589.10 599.89 B: seen fit to ah tempt me to ah burden me with [laughter] i doubt that will ever happen to me um [noise] middle aged housewife um [laughter] but it is interesting what 

592.26 593.68 A: (( [laughter] )) 

594.60 595.74 A: (( [laughter] )) 

596.60 599.45 A: [laughter] well you you have to want something like that yeah
