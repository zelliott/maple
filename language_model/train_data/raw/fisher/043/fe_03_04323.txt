24.22 25.17 A: me too 

24.86 26.72 B: okay and we're supposed to talk 

25.60 27.63 A: that's probably why they matched us up 

27.26 31.01 B: okay we're supposed to talk about what we would go back and change 

29.36 30.05 A: (( [cough] )) 

30.46 33.77 A: now we've got to wonder how much else do they know about us 

33.17 35.31 B: i know [laughter] 

34.32 36.10 A: to match us up 

35.67 38.18 B: i know that's kind of odd isn't it or 

37.23 44.97 A: that was that was kind of weird 'cause i was hoping that it was like if you go back in time where would you go or something like that but it became very like 

44.98 51.55 A: just wo- you know a lifetime of regrets [laughter] they're trying to dredge up 

50.91 54.86 B: that uh that's what yeah that's what i was wondering um [lipsmack] 

55.46 60.84 A: it's hard i can't i actually was gonna say um go back to conception 

60.87 63.98 A: change your parents [laughter] 

62.01 63.68 B: [laughter] 

63.85 66.94 B: well that would be good [laughter] 

65.86 71.95 A: not that i don't like my parents or anything but like what if you if you had to change something i guess you could change something completely 

71.89 74.53 B: yeah that's true i would probably 

74.55 76.31 B: change how my parents 

76.40 78.64 B: handled my teenage years maybe 

78.72 79.83 A: wow 

79.52 80.89 B: i kinda like 

80.95 82.74 B: would like for them to have 

83.03 87.62 B: maybe had a few more rules looking back and now that i have kids of my own 

90.30 91.47 A: so we got a 

90.80 97.44 B: 'cause they didn't have my parents were pretty permissive by the time i became a teenager because there were so many kids ahead of me 

97.14 101.96 A: now i wonder how on topic that is 'cause i think it's um if you could go back in time and change something you did 

101.71 103.63 B: oh anything i did 

103.24 105.13 A: i think i mean i don't know 

104.37 106.26 B: i think that's what it said too 

105.47 110.00 A: is it on topic i mean and there was a time well i guess they said time travel but 

109.62 110.81 B: mhm 

110.28 112.15 A: (( m hm )) 

112.28 116.05 B: if i could change anything i did i probably wouldn't have gotten married so young 

115.90 117.03 A: really 

116.82 121.07 B: the first time i got married when i was nineteen almost twenty 

120.84 122.51 A: oh my gosh 

121.97 123.44 B: that's way too young 

123.04 124.77 A: was it a high school sweetheart 

124.67 126.85 B: yes and then we were in coll- 

127.18 133.08 B: we were in college and my parents didn't want me to get married and [lipsmack] i kinda did it just to show 'em i could i think 

132.16 133.97 A: was he your very first lover 

134.54 136.38 B: yes and 

135.53 137.27 A: oh my gosh 

136.50 138.81 B: and it lasted like a year and a half 

138.56 140.48 A: things compound things 

139.96 144.68 B: yes and i think that that is probably like the one turning point in my life that 

145.38 147.77 B: i made bad decisions for a 

147.05 161.31 A: well my guess would be from what i understand of people that i've known in my life that you probably had a strict religious bri- upbringing where you probably you had to be with the first person you had sex with or something like that 

161.22 162.05 B: yes 

161.36 166.87 A: it was a christian thing or not necessarily has to be christian but it has to be a strict upbringing type thing 

166.67 169.25 B: right i was raised catholic 

169.02 169.61 A: (( [cough] )) 

169.78 170.78 B: and 

169.89 174.02 A: um because i was actually talking to my boyfriend tonight about um 

174.51 178.17 A: some my very first boyfriend when i was sixteen 

178.32 179.59 B: [noise] wow 

179.19 184.14 A: and he was um and i'm forty i'm thirty nine and a half 

183.81 185.69 B: really you sound really young [laughter] 

184.98 196.20 A: [laughter] i actually look really young and my boyfriend's eleven years younger than me i like i say he's really mature and i'm i'm sort of im- what would be considered immature for my age so i sa- i say we meet at thirty five 

195.65 197.17 B: oh that's good 

196.57 209.52 A: pretty much and you know i mean i i look a lot younger i live in southern california and i have a an independent life and that type of thing but i was talking to him about about this person who actually i really respect and love a lot and he was 

209.36 212.64 A: even at that time very much a committed christian [cough] 

212.76 214.38 A: and as time came on 

214.85 222.91 A: i'm i wouldn't say i define myself only this way but i would define myself as being um adept at a lot of religions i believe in many religions i was a 

223.05 225.27 A: i was raised in a methodist religion 

225.32 231.28 A: but i was always pretty much a free thinker i think all religions have value and they also have a negative side 

231.48 242.27 A: and and when i was with him at that early age and we were very passionate and into each other and really just we were debaters and meet at debate camp and um 

231.50 232.89 B: i would agree with that [noise] 

242.97 244.84 A: he would not have sex with me 

245.37 246.25 B: (( oh [noise] [noise] )) 

245.61 249.14 A: [laughter] and because of his convictions 

249.17 254.99 A: and basically after a year i broke up with him over that and went and had sex 'cause i was ready 

255.39 270.03 A: and i was gonna have sex and i did and i have to say that i have lived a life without any marriages although i have a really strongly committed boyfriend now i think we're going to get married and have a family and i'm ready for that now but 

270.12 276.64 A: scott who i was talking about the first boyfriend has had two different marriages two divorces two children by two women 

277.44 278.55 B: right 

277.59 284.19 A: and i feel and i asked and he came and saw me after the second divorce he's married again i don't know how that's going 

284.45 287.77 A: and i said scott don't you think that maybe 

288.85 292.16 A: [mn] it wasn't a good idea [laughter] to not 

292.45 298.24 A: you know to live that way because maybe it just didn't work because what happened was everything was so pent up 

298.54 303.06 A: and then when they even have sex he would marry the first person and it it really wasn't real 

302.94 305.97 B: [noise] right and i would have to agree and going back i would 

306.18 308.85 B: i would think that i would change that 

309.59 314.19 B: that my thinking at that time [laughter] looking back i would not have 

311.58 312.80 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

314.25 316.62 B: felt like i had to marry him 

316.19 319.26 A: but we're so different than um how old are you 

319.16 320.18 B: thirty four 

320.26 324.13 A: so aren't we like i mean aren't you just incredibly different than you were at twenty 

323.90 325.74 B: oh absolutely 

324.97 331.69 A: and i am too i mean even if i was okay with maybe maybe that was the right decision for me that one little thing 

332.02 335.56 A: i mean i was i mean i just can't even imagine being who i was then 

335.51 336.58 B: i know 

336.29 337.30 A: (( you know )) 

336.82 345.37 B: i'm a lot better person now i'm a lot nicer person [laughter] i was real bitchy at [laughter] twenty i think and i've mellowed a lot 

338.18 338.92 A: [laughter] 

340.05 341.27 A: yeah me too 

345.24 351.10 A: i don't know if i i wouldn't say that i w- i actually tried to be nice but um sh- my temper i had a terrible temper 

350.68 353.07 B: oh i did too absolutely 

352.47 353.83 A: and uh 

354.10 357.97 A: so yeah i i think i'm a lot nicer too and everything and in fact 

357.98 365.54 A: you know i'm finally grown up enough that i can imagine a real relationship and really deal with it on a relationship 

365.55 370.23 A: level but i still have to answer the question of what i would change 

370.47 373.06 A: it's just so hard for me i feel put on the spot like 

373.07 375.62 A: like you have to regret parts of your life 

376.44 381.51 A: and if you do then you're who are you 'cause you're you're always formed by what happens to you 

382.48 388.18 A: um [cough] i guess i would say i wish i could have been smarter and less of a drinker early on 

388.45 396.29 B: [noise] [laughter] i think we all could say that maybe [laughter] i probably wouldn't have um quit 

389.17 390.16 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

396.74 405.08 B: i quit college after my senior year of college and went back later and i had to to go over again i wouldn't have done that 

400.02 401.03 A: mhm 

405.15 406.85 B: 'cause that just made it harder 

407.46 409.76 B: i think i mean time wise and things 

410.61 412.06 A: and how many kids do you 

412.35 414.63 B: um um i have one 

415.13 418.59 B: who is two and i have a stepson who is eighteen 

418.39 420.03 A: (( have wow )) 

419.70 420.77 B: yeah 

420.32 422.29 A: talk about a disparate group 

422.03 423.30 B: yeah 

422.87 427.76 A: but it's kinda fun i gue- i bet two year old a two year old two year olds are so cute aren't they 

424.53 425.42 B: yeah 

427.49 431.94 B: yes she keeps me busy and the eighteen year old graduates this friday 

431.79 436.31 A: well what do you think about like if i had a child at about forty four i'm very physically fit 

436.90 441.88 A: and i've actually been saying the next work i get i want it to be a very active physical job 

442.78 446.48 A: [laughter] i mean how how much do s- young kids run you around 

443.23 444.09 B: um 

446.61 450.05 B: well more than i thought they did um yes 

448.36 449.29 A: really 

450.07 451.85 B: and i would have to say 

452.04 453.04 B: that 

453.97 455.11 B: having 

455.16 460.10 B: her later in life i should say af- at thirty two is considered later in life around here 

458.92 459.97 A: mhm 

460.12 472.10 B: where i come from because usually they have 'em at fifteen um [laughter] um i would have to say the one thing that i do is probably appreciate her more i didn't feel like i had to go 

463.57 465.04 A: right right 

472.19 472.77 A: (( [cough] )) 

472.29 475.96 B: keep my career and all of that i gave that up to stay home with her 

475.66 476.67 A: mhm 

476.40 478.75 B: for until she goes to school 

479.36 481.20 B: and then i'll go back to work 

481.16 483.47 A: my mom had me when she was thirty two 

484.14 488.88 A: so um [cough] all i know is that i've never really created much of a career i'm a poet [lipsmack] 

489.01 491.44 A: and i've just created a carer about poetry 

491.61 498.01 A: and which we all know does is really not much of a career [laughter] because nobody buys poetry or cares about it really 

498.91 503.20 A: [lipsmack] and i just feel like gosh i i don't know i could never have been a parent before 

504.36 508.31 B: well but you might may have been able to give them things that you didn't realize 

508.54 509.40 B: you would 

509.55 521.72 B: you know might have given them i'm kind of a free spirit about things i quit my teaching job and took off round the country and traveled for seven years before i got remarried 

522.12 525.04 B: so have having her and 

522.58 523.85 A: that's nice 

525.79 528.03 B: giving up traveling was 

528.50 532.07 B: kinda difficult [laughter] it was an adjustment [laughter] 

531.74 535.71 A: right well no i just i feel like i could actually be ready for it you know 

535.91 544.51 A: it's nice i uh think and then people always try to give you this biological doom like uh-oh there's no way and it can't be and all these things but 

544.12 545.43 B: (( oh i'm sure it can )) 

545.22 546.56 A: i don't feel that way 

546.66 549.61 A: i just feel like i'm really strong and fit and 

549.99 556.28 B: yeah it it can be and i there's advantages and disadvantages to having them later in life 

550.00 551.08 A: (( i don't know )) 

556.74 557.67 B: i think 

557.57 562.08 A: well i think the advantage is that i don't feel like i'm giving up anything at all 

562.34 566.00 A: i feel like i'm opening up a whole new chapter or something like that 

564.91 567.92 B: [noise] right yeah i would yeah that 

567.22 573.27 A: now i wonder if they're monitoring like if women just totally open up to each other right away [laughter] 

572.96 576.24 B: i don't know i would think that they probably are 

576.02 577.26 A: [laughter] 

576.38 578.71 B: i mean that's probably part of the study because 

578.95 581.96 B: it said something about trying to get men 

582.28 584.83 B: to participate in the study [laughter] 

583.99 585.59 A: yeah they're looking for men 

585.23 586.24 B: yeah 

585.66 588.05 A: i tried to get my boyfriend to do it and he wouldn't 

587.80 589.95 B: oh i'm going to talk my husband into it 

589.34 599.90 A: and he was like oh i don't want the government hearing my voice nd he's like uh he's not even that like into th- stuff like that either i've never heard him say stuff like that i go like wait i'm the paranoid one what are you talking about 

594.75 596.19 B: [laughter] 

599.53 599.90 B: (( [laughter] ))
