30.51 33.23 B: ah the only thing i could think of is um 

35.29 39.57 B: oh i don't know maybe i would have finished high school when i was supposed to 

39.46 45.53 A: well that's funny 'cause that was like my own kind of thing i was i would have been a little bit more dedicated and determined

68.70 71.41 A: i don't know it just wasn't something that i believe 

71.80 76.38 A: interest in i just wanted to do it so i didn't have to go back and have to do it again 

72.66 73.54 B: uh-huh 

76.83 78.23 A: and um 

78.67 83.90 A: yeah now i think it would have been a little bit better i did is just put a little bit more effort into it 

83.90 86.47 B: yeah well i waited let's see 

87.29 92.51 B: it's ah like fifteen years before i decided to get my g._d. i never needed it really 

90.42 91.45 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

92.59 95.39 B: for any of my jobs i always had good paying jobs 

95.46 100.00 B: but i had that void that i just wanted to go and get my g._e._d. 

95.59 96.85 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

99.20 101.49 A: for your own personal fulfillment like 

100.25 102.26 B: (( yeah for o- yeah )) 

101.90 114.48 A: i've got a friend like that it's like she's incredibly intelligent she does all kinds of things with computers but she hasn't gone back to do that and she's kind of like hesitant because she didn't something like i don't know she'd go for like kind of embarassed but i don't know like 

114.83 118.50 A: she just should do it so like she can finalize that 

116.18 121.68 B: well there's all ages of people in high s- in college there's all ages when i went there was all ages 

121.80 122.76 B: you know

123.84 125.17 A: ah i don't know 

125.49 127.29 A: but i think that that's really cool 

127.03 129.72 B: 'cause that's what i did i i went back i got it and then 

129.76 133.46 B: i started going for social work and then i decided nah 

131.74 133.50 A: mhm 

133.72 140.32 B: you know it was ah it was very s- high stress because um i did my internship and then i went to 

140.34 146.78 B: to to the place where they hired me and i it was just like too much high stress too much emotion involved 

146.84 147.81 A: [noise] yeah 

147.20 149.84 B: and so i went back and took another 

150.07 152.42 B: ah college thing for um 

153.08 157.65 B: for ah what is it called for computers and that's for learning computers 

155.79 156.66 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

157.78 172.14 A: well that i mean like inevitably is going put you in a good well i don't that's funny because like i was doing pathology and the same thing happened to me i'm like i can't do this it's like stressing me out and i kinda had to go into school for like four more years and like like doing this every day like i was freaking out and like 

158.22 159.07 B: (( well )) 

172.06 175.60 A: every little detail was just more than i wanted to do with a regular basis 

175.54 177.77 B: what is pathology what you studied 

177.70 181.00 A: [noise] it's the study of disease so like i would have to like 

181.26 186.08 A: take slides and like samples all that you know i for somebody that gets a biopsy 

186.15 196.31 A: you would like fly stop whatever it was that they'd taken and then look at it under a slide and you have to like try and identify like certain cells and then see how 

196.50 203.90 A: like they're interacting or how many there are and like be able to like determine what's wrong with that i mean all these people are coming down they're like totally like 

203.99 210.59 A: like on their last legs you know how i mean and like you're their last hope ah finding out what's wrong with them you know they don't know what to do 

210.29 213.18 B: uh-huh and that's all you were going to do was just work in the lab 

210.61 211.57 A: (( and that )) 

214.39 215.56 A: well like um 

215.57 218.01 A: i don't know it sounds it would be pretty cool but it 

218.42 224.45 A: there's it's really stressful like all the people that work there like they've been there for a long time and they're like really serious and just like [noise] i 

224.74 230.87 A: don't know i just can't imagine myself having very much fun it'd be like a really good i don't know rewarding job as far as like 

231.22 233.84 A: [noise] i don't know pay or 

234.37 236.77 A: that but i don't i don't think it'd be very fulfilling 

236.23 243.62 B: it would be like dead end well it's kind of if if you were like going to be like a scientist or something w- 

238.20 239.06 A: um 

242.64 253.60 A: well no i mean like i'd have a doctorate degree like i would totally like be a doctor of pathology like histopathology um like something and have to go for like for like minimum seven years but 

248.85 249.71 B: uh-huh 

253.63 256.51 A: then i'd be there with a degree in something that i didn't want be doing 

256.33 260.12 B: yeah but like this thing with sars and stuff like that then you could find a cure 

260.73 262.61 B: (( [laughter] uh-huh )) 

261.65 271.62 A: well see i would just be like identifying the disease i wouldn't be like be at well like finding the cure kind of like end so yeah i'd just do like telling everybody they have it [noise] 

272.32 273.42 B: oh 

272.55 276.84 A: and waiting for well i wouldn't actually have to deal with people i would just deal with their 

275.38 276.23 B: uh-huh 

277.98 282.30 A: (( their i don't know skin cuttings or whatever i don't know but that kind of thing )) 

280.47 281.34 B: oh 

281.41 284.46 B: so did you end up getting your your g._d. or what [sigh] 

284.43 288.39 A: um well no i i graduated in ninety five and then i got um 

288.41 289.94 A: i stopped the 

289.97 292.87 A: the pathology thing and um 

293.02 295.77 A: i got certified as like a laboratory technician 

295.96 298.54 B: you're not doing anything like that now right [mn] 

298.39 301.93 A: no i mean like [laughter] doing it it's not very much fun 

302.32 303.30 B: uh-huh 

302.54 314.14 A: but i mean like it was i thought like i didn't want it to be a total waste of my time so that way at least i could fall back on that and like 'cause i mean like i would that would be an okay 

314.46 319.28 A: career if like everything else failed to do but i didn't like driving a bus or something 

314.83 316.15 B: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

320.17 327.45 A: but i don't know i i let me i do but i just don't think i would want to be showing up to work

438.87 450.16 B: didn't get married to him we we didn't even talk he was very shy so we really didn't even talk and i think way back when my life would have been like so different if i had hooked up with him 

442.43 443.73 A: [laughter] 

450.52 452.03 B: when we were teenagers 

450.59 456.89 A: what was that all like quite a while like you said in high school and and you guys graduated and then didn't see each other or something

513.41 520.57 B: you know going back in time if there was something 'cause it asked the question what would you change i think that's what i would have changed i would have

525.67 526.95 A: (( that's funny )) 

532.53 543.04 A: that's a lot of my like perspective i've read i don't know i've read book where like um you know there's no point in like really regretting what you've done like you can only use that to like proceed on into the future 

541.29 543.98 B: you can't change the past you can only change the future 

543.71 551.94 A: like no like the cliche not crying over spilt milk like it's like i don't know there's no sense with bothering yourself with that it's happened and just use it

573.54 575.74 A: i don't know like the things that like i 

576.45 582.11 A: totally didn't didn't even think about then then like think about on a now like the 

582.73 588.76 A: or something but i mean it's it's so much more like difficult than it was then and i was like totally overwhelmed with it then 

589.00 589.92 B: yeah 

589.22 590.56 A: it seems kind of silly 

591.07 596.52 B: i don't know it your your goals are different when you're older than when you're just young
