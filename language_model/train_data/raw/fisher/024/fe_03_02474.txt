53.55 54.40 A: uh-huh

117.39 118.21 A: (( i don't know- )) 

117.43 120.90 B: like what having a look at a car accident on the way by 

120.42 131.40 A: yeah kind of especially when they do disco because like nobody can sing disco well without like you know eight million tons of synthesizing effects so it's pretty interesting [laughter] 

129.16 130.12 B: right 

132.52 134.69 A: (( but um yeah i don't know )) 

135.38 139.04 A: (( uh [sigh] i'm trying to think of what other reality shows there are )) 

140.03 141.03 B: um 

141.56 146.51 B: you know because i don't watch them i don't really know i mean there is 

145.54 148.18 A: oh what about stuff like the osbournes

156.96 159.30 B: i you know i just can't 

159.69 167.84 B: i just can't tolerate it i guess um it's just it almost seems like it's a waste of my time to actually sit and watch it 

167.54 168.71 A: yeah 

168.26 172.60 B: so i i don't even know like i don't i wouldn't flip through and look for them 

172.82 173.71 B: um 

173.91 176.89 B: i g- i really i don't get why [laughter] 

177.13 183.18 B: watch them though i mean the osbournes it's just like to me from what i've seen it's just um 

183.84 186.60 B: you know this family that is 

187.24 188.13 B: um 

188.25 190.88 B: (( what's the word i'm looking for it's just like this )) 

192.18 193.08 B: um 

193.14 194.45 B: crazy 

195.00 197.27 B: (( you know like a car accident you know )) 

196.42 198.18 A: (( yeah seriously )) 

197.93 206.09 B: it's like you know swearing and i mean that's basically all his conversation everything comes out of his mouth it's you know on regular t._v. gets beeped 

205.90 207.83 A: [laughter] 

206.99 209.78 B: so it's like you know i mean that's 

209.97 212.88 B: it's just kinda like a car wreck you know and just 

212.09 213.19 A: yeah 

213.63 218.40 A: i mean that's how i feel about like the judge show like in divorce court and things like that 

213.91 214.68 B: but 

218.19 219.76 B: oh my god 

219.21 224.73 A: i'm just like i think some people are so desperate to be seen so they'll just do like do anything for fifteen minutes 

224.97 227.96 B: yeah oh yeah they h- you know and it's 

227.97 234.75 B: it i don't know i guess it's um you know you think your life is pathetic you can turn the t._v. on and see a more pathetic life 

234.17 235.30 A: [laughter] 

235.40 238.45 B: and make yourself feel better i'm not really sure 

237.09 238.65 A: yeah seriously 

238.79 240.41 A: and like jerry springer 

241.00 242.98 B: (( oh that's bad that's really )) 

241.00 242.19 A: (( that's just )) 

242.22 244.06 A: yeah that's ridiculous 

245.76 250.89 A: it's like all you have to do to be on that show is show your chest or i don't know 

251.25 254.38 A: have some sort of weird lesbian affair on tv [laughter] 

254.21 256.67 B: bad yeah uh it's pretty gross 

257.25 258.23 A: (( uh )) 

259.64 264.81 A: oh but yeah it's just like i don't know i guess they're cheaper for the networks to make or something 

266.19 269.09 B: probably i mean cost wise 

269.28 281.66 B: although some of those reality shows i mean they're on you know i mean they're being flown to these islands apparently they don't have to feed them all that much so they cut down on food costs but i mean they're flying people everywhere or 

281.32 288.37 A: but still they're not paid actors they're not you know union actors they're not paying them a million dollars an episode or anything like that 

288.06 289.01 B: (( true that's )) 

288.82 291.65 A: you know these people volunteer to be on the show 

289.30 290.01 B: (( true )) 

291.70 293.40 B: right that's true 

293.79 294.62 A: (( so )) 

293.80 298.88 B: uh but you know what the great race that one always seems kind of cool have you seen that 

298.52 302.82 A: w- is that the one where the couples have to go like all over the world and they don't know where they are 

302.71 303.86 B: yeah 

303.98 311.32 A: don't they yeah that seems cool and i think that i would actually like to do something like that but at the same time it seems kind of really scary [laughter] 

310.99 315.17 B: it does seem really scary it does but they um 

315.72 318.24 B: the one episode that i saw they were 

318.46 322.90 B: um like you know that you have to find clues 

322.91 332.38 B: that lead to you you know you're in a foreign country and they they give you this race where all these couples you know you have to i don't know whatever it was either choose 

332.58 334.11 B: to cross 

334.35 338.95 B: um like this desert area either on horseback or on a._t._v. 

338.61 339.47 A: uh-huh 

339.24 344.53 B: and whichever choice you got you know you went to the end and found your clue 

344.79 353.95 B: by either a really easy method or a really difficult method i think it like they were really easy like you had to ride the horse but then you got your answer really easy 

353.43 354.32 A: uh-huh 

354.09 361.58 B: or you rode the a._t._v. but the and to try and get the answer at the end was a little more difficult and then 

360.73 362.45 A: oh that's really interesting 

362.26 370.23 B: and then you come back and you know you have your clue and then you have to figure out what your clue means and then you have to you know 

370.42 372.21 B: whatever get to 

372.36 373.35 B: um 

373.82 388.57 B: a certain point at a certain time like the clue is to get to a restaurant at you know such and such a road or whatever and um you know you have to figure that out because like in whatever your clue was with the 

388.97 398.36 B: title to the restaurant or you know something like that so you have to ask people 'cause of course it's in a foreign language 'cause you're in a foreign country to try and find people to help you 

395.36 396.19 A: (( mhm )) 

398.23 404.51 B: figure it out and and so then you have to figure out how to get there and see you know whether you take 

404.62 406.91 B: a taxi or whatever 

406.51 407.55 A: right 

407.11 411.86 B: and you actually get there and then you know they over a certain period of time they 

412.02 413.11 B: (( um what )) 

413.48 422.22 B: was it they o- you know like so and so won this day and they you know they got so many points along the way or whatever so you get on a like a rating team 

421.84 422.80 A: (( mhm )) 

422.49 429.41 B: and it it was like if you're on like the last you know the person that shows up last gets kicked off 

429.13 430.07 A: okay 

429.99 439.42 B: so but it you could get you didn't know where you were you knew you were like close to last but like you know they'd say well i'm going to go get 

435.28 436.19 A: okay 

439.38 447.11 B: um they'd have things that you could go get and say you have a bye for that day or or you know whatever so you could go 

447.39 461.28 B: you know you race to get your your free pass so you so you didn't have to go through the test or you didn't have to you know you didn't have to deal with that that one day and you could just they'd just hop kick over to the next day 

451.17 451.99 A: (( mhm )) 

460.82 462.05 A: oh that's cool 

461.91 465.44 B: so it was actually pretty interesting but i don't know if it's still on 

465.29 471.74 A: oh that sounds like really cool 'cause it's not just people you know getting on t._v. and doing stupid things it's people actually like you know 

470.80 472.79 B: like fear factor 

472.36 474.49 A: oh my god i hate that show 

474.15 476.11 B: isn't that the grossest thing 

475.71 479.51 A: (( yeah people sticking bugs in their mouths and just like ugh )) 

479.40 481.31 B: that's really nasty 

480.92 482.72 A: yeah yeah i 

481.84 486.60 B: so yeah i mean that was i like i said i don't if it was it's still on because 

486.90 492.73 B: you know maybe it was it was too close to [laughter] being a decent show and so they 

489.63 490.90 A: right 

492.83 494.21 A: they canned it 

493.25 495.91 B: (( i don't know if it if it had a lot of draw )) 

495.91 500.06 A: yeah i don't think was it i don't know was that on c._b._s. or something 

500.62 504.34 B: um you know i don't really know what station it was on 

502.22 503.17 A: (( yeah )) 

504.44 505.00 A: (( oh )) 

504.77 507.56 B: again it was just one of those like i kinda clicked on and 

507.46 508.62 A: right 

507.75 512.69 B: i'd heard about and it was like oh well let's see what it's all about kind of thing 

511.63 512.59 A: (( yeah uh )) 

513.16 514.15 B: so 

514.86 520.18 A: yeah oh man but it just seems like every time i turn on the t._v. there's more and more of those reality shows 

520.54 521.69 B: (( really yeah )) 

521.28 522.38 A: yeah 

522.60 534.33 A: that one that's on fox right now it's mr personality just freaks me out though because like i can't even imagine being in a house like which is a r- all these guys in masks and monica lewinsky like come on that's so scary 

533.94 535.89 B: uh yeah [laughter] i know 

534.84 539.10 A: you don't know and any these people and they show her like kissing the guy and stuff like that 

539.29 540.63 B: oh really 

539.97 544.38 A: yeah and like this is some dude in a mask that you don't know from anybody [mn] 

545.64 550.48 B: you know all of them seem like that like the what was it the bachelor and the bachelorette 

550.14 551.07 A: mm 

551.03 555.32 B: i just i don't know that's to me it's a little creepy to be like you know 

555.70 564.91 B: you know twelve girls fighting over one guy and you know he's going to go on a date with me and then he's going to go on a date with you two hours later 

559.68 560.74 A: yeah 

564.51 565.58 A: right 

565.63 567.87 B: that to me is just really creepy 

567.49 578.80 A: yeah it is really weird like even the dating shows and all where it has like you know five girls against one guy and you know it's just so weird it's so weird to see girls get so competitive over like the dorkiest guys [laughter] 

577.25 578.24 B: (( yes [laughter] )) 

579.40 580.34 B: yeah 

581.03 584.47 A: (( uh it's well whatever but )) 

586.23 587.33 A: um 

587.69 589.58 A: eee 

589.71 592.86 A: trying to think what other reality shows i've seen 

593.71 596.71 A: oh wh- what about this reality movie 

596.73 599.24 A: m._t._v. cancun or something like that 

599.11 599.89 B: (( i know ))
