1.64 5.73 B: hi michael this is angie i've never done this before [laughter] 

3.71 4.66 A: (( how do you do )) 

5.08 8.31 A: [laughter] this is my second night i did it last night so 

8.02 9.08 B: okay 

8.69 17.89 A: ah i've i'll kind of get the topic going then they gave us the seven vices basically they want to know what we think's the worst one 

14.76 15.67 B: right 

17.96 22.45 A: um i guess i'd say a lot of them are bad but ah 

21.34 25.56 B: well to me what were they again or i didn't write them down ah i've sm- 

24.64 26.40 A: no i didn't write them down either 

25.97 28.78 B: smoking to me is probably the worst 

28.15 31.34 A: you think smoking's the worst what about over eating or 

31.47 39.78 A: well over eating they've just come out with a lot of new studies that say how bad it is to be excessively obese 'cause the 

38.42 40.15 B: well but i think 

39.96 53.84 B: the w- the problem i have with smoking is that it's a combination of um bad for you and it's not like you have to do it to live i mean e- food is actually something you do need to do to live 

53.76 60.17 B: but smoking is a choice that you make you know hopefully as an adult and and to me 

56.91 57.86 A: (( obese mhm )) 

58.35 59.34 A: uh-huh 

60.55 71.06 B: even though the other ones are all you know serious the fact that you don't have to smoke smoking i mean a- foo- ah even even drinking alcohol 

64.16 65.09 A: uh-huh 

66.88 68.05 A: oh yeah 

71.02 82.74 B: i don't want to say you have to but but the social aspects of it or or whatever can make it acceptable but um smoking there is no reason for smoking none whatsoever 

77.34 78.21 A: (( uh-huh )) 

81.47 82.31 A: (( no )) 

82.48 95.71 A: no i've i've never smoked in my life so i don't i don't understand what people i think people start when when they're young because they think it's cool or whatever and then um they're they're basically addicted to it and they can't stop and 

94.15 101.41 B: well you know i mean and the and part of the reason i also have a problem with smoking too is that their industry is so um 

101.83 103.61 B: they're such liars 

103.16 104.85 A: (( oh uh-huh yeah uh-huh )) 

103.96 107.89 B: you know so it is there i think a- around the 

108.63 117.79 B: the bigger part of the if if you look at you know reasons why accessibility blah blah blah i think smoking kind of takes the cake for me on 

114.33 116.10 A: yeah 

117.70 124.41 A: okay what about um food you don't have a problem with um well the problem with 

124.54 130.86 A: drinking is that ah if people get behind the wheel and start driving then we have drunk drivers in which they 

129.63 132.16 B: well but but drunk 

132.20 135.25 B: um drinking doesn't kill one out of three people 

135.35 136.85 A: (( uh-huh no uh-uh )) 

136.25 141.50 B: it doesn't you know even even you can't say there is one out of three people is an alcoholic 

137.16 137.93 A: yeah 

141.48 143.02 A: (( no uh-uh no )) 

142.57 155.67 B: so um and and with the exception of somebody who's driving drunk i ah if if you're drinking at home you're not affecting anybody else you know um second hand smoker is just as dangerous 

155.63 164.31 B: if not more so than smoking itself so not only are you choosing to put yourself in jeopardy you're putting me in jeopardy too 

164.30 165.58 A: (( yeah uh-huh uh-huh yeah )) 

164.98 167.97 B: whereas alcohol unless you know 

168.12 172.74 B: heaven forbid a a drunk driving accident or something but 

172.32 173.28 A: uh-huh 

172.76 180.02 B: i- um you know if you're taking the bus or if somebody's driving you home that's not affecting it's not going to hurt other people 

179.64 185.65 A: well it affects the other people in their family like if they have children and their spouses and things 

184.61 187.35 B: it does but how many people are alcoholics 

187.67 188.54 B: (( you know )) 

187.75 190.03 A: i don't what's the statistics i don't know what's 

189.27 195.13 B: of of people who drink alcohol at all i would bet it's not one out of three are alcoholics 

192.04 192.99 A: uh-huh 

195.01 197.47 A: no probably not not that high but 

197.40 200.40 B: you know it'd be kind of like getting in a huff over ah 

200.55 209.02 B: bumble bee stings killing people i mean if if if [laughter] if it's one out of a hundred people who drink alcohol which i bet is high 

203.14 204.08 A: (( [laughter] )) 

204.46 205.37 A: (( uh-huh )) 

209.06 209.86 A: (( uh-huh ))

212.27 213.26 A: (( oh uh-huh )) 

212.91 214.03 B: um 

214.21 219.66 B: if it's one out of a hundred i'd be surprised so it's not ex- you know it's not exactly the 

221.03 223.40 B: a- as big of a killer as smoking 

221.38 222.04 A: (( uh-huh ))
