231.44 232.23 A: (( i mean )) 

232.95 242.33 A: i just think gossiping is bad because you never know what people say about you and [mn] if you say like it's a cycle and then everybody thinks that everybody is saying something about them and then 

242.53 246.97 A: it like it destroys trust and all that stuff you know like 

247.29 260.58 A: it affects it can affect so many people when you when you are smoking it just affects you and maybe if you choose to smoke with other p- in in front of other peo- like you can't prevent people from gossiping you cannot but you can tell somebody 

260.39 263.48 A: all right you can't smoke in front of me you have to get out [mn] 

264.00 264.87 A: so

285.71 288.03 B: excessive drinking 

288.78 290.61 B: (( that's bad )) 

290.37 293.08 A: (( [laughter] that's bad too yeah [mn] ))

296.77 297.71 A: yeah 

298.39 302.86 B: i had more trouble with smoking than i had with drinking and quitting 

303.33 310.21 A: really but people don't become like don't change their behavior when they're smoking they do change their behavior when they're drinking
