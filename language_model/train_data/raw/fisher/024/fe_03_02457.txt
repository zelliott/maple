135.61 136.81 A: (( oh ahah )) 

136.44 142.04 B: and you know i i don't know i thought that was kind of tacky really for for us to 

139.98 141.79 A: i didn't watch that one 

142.06 144.48 B: deal with and see [mn] 

144.67 149.50 A: there was a program on oh gosh maybe a few months before 

150.06 151.62 A: oh can't re- 

150.62 152.87 B: i'm a celebrity get me outta here 

152.55 166.43 A: no no i don't know if it if it's really the topic that we're supposed to be on or not but it was where they [mn] all the contestants were in different countries and they had to run run the race to see who got there first 

153.12 154.21 B: (( okay )) 

165.38 169.11 B: my sister watched that the race 

166.90 168.21 A: that was interesting 

168.57 171.45 A: ah something like that i can't remember the title 

170.04 174.78 B: yeah i didn't watch any of it because i don't know why [mn] 

174.23 185.49 A: well i g i got started i didn't think i would enjoy it but then after a while [mn] ah you got drawn into the characters in it you know some of them you liked and some you didn't 

184.63 187.83 B: was that one where there was like two brothers 

187.10 189.94 A: mhm twins mhm 

187.85 189.73 B: and a husband and wife 

189.77 193.93 B: okay i think i did see a little but not enough to really understand what was going on 

193.58 199.35 A: i wanted the husband and wife to win although i didn't care for him but i sure did like her 

199.46 204.85 A: and i really wanted them to win and at the very end they came in second 

204.29 207.33 B: oh and those brothers won right 

206.75 212.01 A: no they didn't mm mm no and everyone thought they would probably win 

207.55 208.51 B: okay 

212.43 220.57 A: [mn] and i don't know if that qualifies as reality t._v. or not but [mn] either way those are the only two really that i have watched 

215.18 217.77 B: mhm i think so 

219.99 222.04 B: i can't watch the um 

222.32 226.61 B: i can't think fear factor i can't watch that me either 

223.97 234.81 A: i don't like that i watched it one time during dinner [laughter] and i had to turn it over because it was they were eating cockroaches 

234.14 236.83 B: ah see it's just not necessary 

236.39 242.69 A: uh-uh and i thought there's no amount of money in the world that would make me do that you know i just couldn't 

237.24 237.87 B: (( [mn] )) 

241.01 242.05 B: [laughter] 

242.40 252.33 B: [mn] i couldn't either and i was thinking you know about the highest amount and no i don't know not a cockroach not a worm 

250.78 256.13 A: [laughter] but you know that was degrading to me for them to have to even do that 

255.87 256.80 B: [mn] 

256.54 261.98 A: i just thought that was horrible they would even be asked to do that [mn] so 

261.84 265.09 B: you know i think a lot of these shows started with 

265.29 271.94 B: [mn] the idea of this the m._t._v. had real world and oh let me think real quick 

272.40 278.45 B: road rules and in road rules they had to do different things to earn their 

273.53 274.47 A: (( ahah )) 

278.54 284.31 B: chips to have enough at the end so they would win the big bucks 

281.34 282.22 A: oh 

283.65 286.05 A: ahah i didn't watch that 

285.46 292.77 B: um well i at the time i had teenagers living at home and they were into it we were taping it when we were missing it and everything else 

289.25 290.75 A: really 

291.61 299.64 A: well you know you're mentioning teenagers you have um i think a lot of the t._v. now is geared towards the younger person 

299.81 304.22 A: you know and what they like because they have supposedly the buying dollar 

304.22 307.57 B: [mn] [mn] well um that's crazy 

304.44 305.45 A: and 

307.23 310.49 A: well i know because who gives them the buying dollar 

310.23 315.16 B: and they need to be out outside or working [laughter] not watching t._v. 

313.77 316.21 A: (( ahah right )) 

315.31 323.02 B: but um i- -s that why i don't have cable is that why i don't watch hardly any t._v. [laughter] that stuff's not geared to me 

320.48 322.15 A: [laughter] 

322.66 326.50 A: oh gosh [mn] this is fun i 

325.75 328.66 B: you're you're close to my son he's in um 

328.78 330.06 B: sheppard 

330.02 337.26 A: sheppard ah air force oh ahah i was born in wichita falls mhm [lipsmack] that's in texas 

330.82 332.61 B: in wichita falls 

334.50 335.75 B: really 

335.76 338.03 B: all he complains about is the wind 

338.16 340.47 A: well down there it is the wind 

340.49 346.30 A: now i live in the north east corner of oklahoma so really we're quite a ways apart but um 

345.73 348.33 B: yeah but you're a lot closer than i am to him 

347.95 351.33 A: oh yeah how long has it been since you've been with him 

350.86 358.26 B: um he joined in october and we came down in september to watch him graduate and then get married 

353.11 353.94 A: (( ahah )) 

356.57 358.93 A: (( oh ahah ahah )) 

358.58 370.50 B: and my sister lives in um brazoria and she's the one that turned me onto this but um we went from houston to san antonio and to see him and get married

371.51 374.40 B: no he no he's not done trained 

374.46 377.95 B: so i'm hoping that training lasts forever 

375.79 376.51 A: (( ahah )) 

377.52 386.99 A: yeah and the war is basically over now so if he if he does have to go probably it will be a you know a whole whole lot safer 

386.79 391.69 B: exactly until it takes somebody's place to hold one fort down or something but 

391.22 392.40 A: right 

391.75 392.71 B: um 

392.93 394.08 A: (( right )) 

393.24 396.51 B: i guess we're not supposed to talk about the war and all that 

394.78 401.92 A: i don't know probably not lisa [laughter] i don't know i don't know if we can talk ten minutes about reality t._v. or not though 

396.73 397.75 B: (( [laughter] )) 

400.88 407.53 B: you know i watched i'm a celebrity get me outta here and that is it sounded like the most stupid thing in the whole world

548.71 550.31 B: i don't know for kids 

549.17 555.55 A: it probably doesn't stop them if they're if they really have talent they're going to go ahead and pursue it
