54.05 56.22 A: right that's i've watched that 

55.69 62.58 B: yeah i watched that one but now this one where she they they're all masked is she has to choose one 

62.01 63.20 A: right 

62.61 63.45 B: (( i )) 

63.95 69.80 B: [mn] why do you think it's so popular why do you think so many people watch them [noise] 

69.12 73.59 A: well to see that she's picking um the guys not by um 

74.21 78.40 A: it's not by it's not by how they look but it's how their appearance is 

77.70 79.17 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

78.48 87.96 A: and most people i guess they don't look at the appearance they look first at at the out- outside person not the um [mn] not the inside person here she has to [mn] 

87.81 95.07 A: like use like a lot of different senses and she has to instead of just looking at physical she has to see how they are maybe mentally or 

94.94 95.76 B: (( mm )) 

95.12 99.05 A: their personality how they talk and then they were getting drunk on the last one 

98.93 99.95 B: (( ahah i )) 

100.79 102.03 B: think um 

101.99 115.23 B: [mn] i don't know i don't like the double standard with the the shows between the men and the women on the reality shows [mn] like the joe millionaire he could kiss everybody all night but then they had the female version of the bachelorette and they were 

114.99 120.12 B: very concerned about her kissing different people and and what she did and her interaction 

119.76 120.71 A: right 

120.39 134.48 B: i mean a double standard and i'm like well the guy did the same thing [mn] so what's the big deal i didn't really [mn] oh like that but i just think there are so many because people aren't creative any more i think we've resorted to 

133.21 134.29 A: yeah 

134.53 135.63 B: you know 

135.78 139.04 B: (( let's just take it let's just spy basically )) 

138.58 139.91 A: right [laughter] 

139.40 144.23 B: you know just spy into the lives of people you know and market that you know 

144.30 149.88 B: i watched one where um these the couples were getting married [mn] and 

148.46 151.00 A: oh no i didn't see that one i know what you're talking about 

151.08 156.93 B: that was so good and then in the end both couples that made it to the end neither one ended up getting married 

155.98 158.83 A: [laughter] right that i saw the end that's what i saw 

157.85 161.50 B: yeah there was so much pain there and i mean 

161.51 165.15 B: and then after i felt bad even watching it because it's like you know 

164.12 166.21 A: because they were crying and yeah 

166.04 173.70 B: yeah you know and i'm like [mn] who am i to even be watching so and then but i couldn't tear myself away [laughter] 

171.98 175.83 A: all right but i do watch the real world and sometimes on and off 

175.23 177.15 B: yeah yeah 

176.16 183.43 A: it it's about like real life and it's not all staged and i don't think they're act- i don't think they're acting i think everything is really real 

179.60 181.33 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

183.82 185.59 B: i think that's closer to r- 

185.44 195.10 B: a reality show than these other ones the real world that comes on m._t._v. [mn] 'cause it it's very raw but it seems to me like the bachelorette and all that stuff 

190.18 191.23 A: yeah 

194.51 195.47 A: right 

194.94 201.93 B: it i mean they edit things and i just think and they already know the outcome and i just 

200.73 204.09 A: did you watch um temptation island 

203.68 205.35 B: [mn] no 

204.18 205.30 A: everybody 

205.32 211.31 A: part of it i watched where they cheat on each other left and right and they're married or they're going out with people or something 

211.40 218.97 B: [mn] oh and they were ch- somebody was cheating or something like that and got caught or something yeah yeah 

215.76 219.64 A: yeah yeah yeah 

219.33 221.53 B: pretty much like a soap opera 

220.11 229.76 A: it was for um it was a committed couple i don't think they were married and they were testing like the strength of their relationship and there was like i think thirteen women and there was thirteen men 

224.27 225.13 B: (( oh )) 

229.52 230.65 B: mhm 

229.81 239.90 A: and they were doing stupid things and they were insulting each other and [mn] i don't know i watched it [laughter] i taped it so i could like fast forward it that's basically it 

235.70 237.01 B: yeah [mn] 

239.75 245.86 B: yeah someone was saying earlier they didn't think it was really reality t._v. but more escape t._v. 

245.56 246.46 A: right 

246.29 251.79 B: i think part of it the reactions and [mn] the the insight into human character is real 

251.56 252.59 A: mhm 

251.87 256.11 B: but you know the situations are unlikely but it's still 

256.21 258.02 B: real but um 

258.07 263.13 B: they're definitely popular and you are you're watching them and you're like oh 

263.42 266.15 A: (( well they're better than something else that's out there i don't know )) 

263.43 265.18 B: [mn] what happened 

266.34 267.87 B: mhm 

267.45 275.83 A: 'cause i've seen like ah i mean the soap the soap operas are getting boring i've been watching general hospital and port charles and then those talk shows are getting ridiculous [mn] 

273.07 274.41 B: yeah 

275.79 283.45 B: they are they're getting to be and but that's a part of reality t._v. now that is that's that's the part that's the reality for some people 

283.12 284.32 A: (( right right )) 

283.68 288.75 B: you know for very few of us i don't think it's a reflection of america on the whole but 

288.81 296.78 B: they dig up some strange things and that's part of reality television and i think that's part of what started it all 

296.52 297.49 A: mhm 

296.83 302.10 B: ah these crazy talk shows well let's go home with them and find out how they live at home 

301.54 310.11 A: [laughter] oh with that um ozzy osbourne i haven't watched that one yet but that looks so she my f- my daughter watches it it looks retarded though [laughter] 

305.91 308.05 B: yeah 

310.32 314.50 B: now i watched anna nicole and you know before i didn't 

312.81 315.47 A: she watched that too i didn't watch it yet [mn] right 

315.04 322.26 B: but you know i didn't even know anything about her before i didn't even like her really but since i've started watching her reality show i like her 

322.35 331.24 B: because she is every day people who who happen to have come into some money but she is still so country ye- 

329.61 335.77 A: right yeah supposedly she slept with that old man she [noise] and she got a lot of money 

333.09 334.41 B: yeah 

335.08 339.87 B: to get his money but she's still a regular every day working girl single mom 

339.41 342.88 A: yes well now because he's dead [laughter] 

342.12 348.56 B: you know well he's dead but but i don't know if she'll get his money but she'll definitely get money from this reality show 

348.26 349.23 A: right 

349.01 352.03 B: but i think and i think that's part of it you know you 

352.02 364.88 B: you identify with the other person and you're like oh well they're just like me or they grew up with the same things or you know she can't get a date either or you know or she has problems just like any one else 

357.14 358.25 A: (( [noise] right )) 

364.58 365.35 A: (( ahah )) 

364.93 367.91 B: and that may be what makes it popular but 

368.07 372.34 B: [mn] i i don't know i don't want to be overrun with reality t._v. 

371.41 379.55 A: um i've been reading a lot about what they say it's like taking a peek at the lives of the other people and that's what they like about it they can see how other people live 

376.18 377.48 B: mhm 

377.75 379.01 B: mhm 

379.30 390.08 B: mhm [mn] it's like being a nosey neighbor but you don't have to leave home [laughter] you don't have to pull out the binoculars 'cause you just turn on the television set 

382.61 385.33 A: definitely [laughter] 

387.63 388.81 A: (( mhm )) 

390.06 398.60 B: but did you see the reality show with um [mn] this guy he's a millionaire already his family firestone the firestone

412.27 414.17 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

413.39 418.35 B: he was just really serious and i'm thinking why is he on t._v. they know 

417.26 422.18 A: well did he know that um on that one that that he had money 

423.01 426.67 B: (( yeah they know he's firestone they know he's firestone )) 

423.31 424.71 A: oh they know 

426.11 426.90 A: (( ah )) 

426.77 431.19 B: but i mean when you have millions like that you must really be bored 

430.71 432.28 A: [laughter] 

431.66 436.01 B: i mean you save that for the the average joe that you know what i mean 

435.34 436.74 A: yeah 

436.15 440.15 B: (( you got millions of dollars you know you're not going to take home any of these women ))

440.55 443.72 B: (( you know you're not going to take 'em home to your mother or your father )) 

443.41 444.96 A: sure that's true 

444.32 446.23 B: so this i think 

445.20 447.61 A: most of 'em are probably just after the money [mn] 

447.52 457.56 B: yeah yeah and he knows it [mn] and so that was kinda boring to me i really think i liked most the one where the guy was the girls didn't know that he was a millionaire 

448.09 449.52 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

456.71 458.29 A: (( yeah )) 

457.79 460.18 B: and he was such a cutie potootie 

459.81 467.64 A: i know and then he didn't marry her anyway or he didn't he i i heard at the end he never married and they they've ah they lost contact 

460.66 461.64 B: (( [mn] )) 

462.72 463.38 B: w- 

467.49 475.29 B: yeah she wasn't that kind of girl anyway when they were in the hot tub and the other girls came and she got up and left he didn't say anything 

474.62 476.19 A: (( yeah )) 

475.36 478.47 B: i knew then that she he wasn't on her level 

476.36 476.92 A: (( [mn] )) 

478.12 479.42 A: right 

478.67 481.05 B: and he stayed he didn't even move 

481.09 486.85 B: but i knew he wasn't going to pick the other girl 'cause she was so highfalutin' and nasty 

486.39 487.45 A: (( right )) 

487.17 488.47 B: and nasty acting 

487.69 492.36 A: yeah she was she said like he's mine he's mine [laughter] 

490.54 497.13 B: yeah and then she did the hoochy behind the scenes you know [laughter] and you know you need to cut that out 

493.45 494.96 A: [laughter]

497.51 500.53 B: (( huh you know where she did )) 

498.69 502.37 A: well i know she did that but i wonder what she did 

502.07 510.73 B: she did i think somebody at work told me she admitted it or he admitted it or something but she played herself though she 

508.00 509.00 A: right 

510.14 511.82 A: oh my god 

511.53 513.68 B: (( really made herself look )) 

513.90 520.72 B: real bad on national television but i guess that's what it's all about 'cause how how many women 

518.50 519.56 A: right 

520.97 527.24 B: and men in america would do just about anything for a dollar right or 

523.63 526.34 A: to make money or for t._v. 

526.79 529.11 A: yeah 

528.21 529.90 B: get exposure

540.17 544.33 A: i believe it's about ten minutes i never now how do we get paid for this i have no idea 

543.82 552.39 B: well we are supposed to keep talking about it until a prompt comes on to let us know when our ten minutes is up and then we can hang up and then after 

549.95 554.61 A: right right but they don't know me this is the first time i've done this 

554.58 558.39 B: well they don't know me either but they have your information 

558.82 559.82 B: 'cause they knew 

559.06 561.14 A: oh from the phone number you mean 

560.93 562.20 B: (( yeah they have )) 

561.64 565.43 A: okay yeah 'cause the phone is in my name yeah 

562.48 564.03 B: (( your infor- )) 

564.72 568.50 B: (( yeah they have to call and then after your third call evidently )) 

568.38 571.84 A: right no this is my first one i've never i mean i've tried 

568.66 569.41 B: um 

571.62 572.74 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

571.93 574.08 A: but i've never gotten on to [noise] 

574.28 579.67 A: the talking and [mn] just kept saying that they didn't need me or something and and they hung up on me 

577.62 588.50 B: mhm oh yeah so [noise] yeah it's crazy and i'm talking all this but you know what i'll probably turn on my television the very next time [laughter] 

586.90 589.03 A: [laughter] and we're gonna watch it again [laughter] 

588.80 592.12 B: i mean well it's more exciting than my life that's for sure 

591.80 593.73 A: right [laughter] 

592.54 596.05 B: so i guess i guess that's why people are tuning in 

595.70 596.76 A: yeah 

596.55 599.89 B: to watch someone else's drama is always better than your own
