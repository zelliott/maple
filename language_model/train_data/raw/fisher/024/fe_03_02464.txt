46.51 47.68 B: but yeah 

52.37 54.73 A: oh my not again [laughter] 

54.33 56.51 B: i know i know 

56.30 59.27 A: okay so why do you like reality shows so much 

59.61 65.01 B: i i don't know i think it like gives me a glimpse into somebody else's life to live vicariously through it 

64.59 68.96 A: yo isn't that sad though i mean that's why i do it too but [laughter] 

66.37 67.93 B: [laughter] 

68.79 74.42 B: [laughter] i mean i don't know i'm like you know wife couple of kids it gives me my escape 

73.01 73.72 A: (( [laughter] )) 

74.26 75.79 A: yeah exactly 

75.55 78.68 B: [laughter] is that why you watch it too 

76.86 77.77 A: (( [laughter] and )) 

78.52 82.15 A: yeah probably and well do you watch survivor 

82.35 84.41 B: a little bit not very much 

83.58 92.74 A: okay 'cause that one that's the first one i watched and i liked it because i liked seeing how other people interacted and how they 

93.35 98.73 A: you know what went through their minds and why they made the choices they did and 

98.79 99.65 B: right 

100.01 110.18 A: it's just interesting to see how other people think and why they make their decisions [mn] that's probably why i watch it too to see how other people live you know 

110.30 117.68 B: right i agree i mean i watched the first season of survivor and that kind of gave me a bad taste because so many people seemed conniving 

113.81 114.71 A: mhm 

117.72 118.73 A: right 

118.35 125.64 B: i don't know it i mean i would hope that in real life people didn't deal with me that way on a daily basis even though i'm sure they do 

125.35 126.34 A: right 

125.67 127.50 B: and that bothered me a little bit 

128.14 132.53 A: yeah i could see that but it's also at least like survivor is a game i 

132.68 133.86 B: well that's true 

132.86 140.81 A: mean the whole point of the game i mean they say it is to outlive outlast and outwit or something like that i can't remember 

139.45 140.42 B: right 

141.07 149.01 A: [mn] so in shows like that i'm like okay they're supposed to do whatever they can to win this money but then like you know joe millionaire 

150.02 154.32 A: (( they [laughter] that was just weird )) 

151.00 159.26 B: [laughter] i know i hate to admit i was so addicted to that show though it was something that i couldn't contain 

157.14 158.19 A: i know 

159.19 160.81 A: i know so was i 

160.75 167.08 B: you know and then i have like this huge fantasy in my head of what these people are really like and now that it's over and you're seeing them in the media it's 

167.15 168.48 B: totally different 

168.44 171.37 A: oh see i don't i haven't seen them in the media so 

170.77 172.07 B: [laughter] 

172.06 173.32 A: i don't know [mn] 

173.36 174.72 A: so what are they like 

173.50 174.41 B: i mean 

175.11 178.40 B: just totally different like that ted evan marriott 

178.10 179.24 A: (( mhm )) 

178.81 180.18 B: completely 

180.48 187.70 B: seems like such a different individual it seemed like he had you know some of the solid foundations in life that we desire in an individual 

187.48 188.45 A: right 

188.55 191.60 B: and now he seems so different he seems so fake 

191.76 192.48 A: (( hm )) 

192.51 193.88 B: and that bothers me 

193.99 195.00 B: (( you know )) 

194.66 199.90 A: yeah it it almost seemed like during the show though he was like oh i'm doing this so i 

200.05 202.32 A: can get t._v. time and 

202.31 203.61 B: exactly 

202.33 205.10 A: so people can get to know me and 

204.90 206.21 B: exactly 

206.66 207.73 B: i agree 

207.97 209.79 B: what do you think about the new bachelor [noise] 

209.91 214.92 A: oh [mn] um well i think that he's gonna pick kristin 

215.13 219.88 A: but i wish he'd i wish he'd pick jen i like jen she's my favorite 

215.41 216.34 B: (( do you )) 

217.73 218.80 B: (( me too )) 

219.91 221.39 B: i agree [mn] 

220.99 225.35 A: i mean he says things like and she complements him so well 

226.25 228.51 B: i know and that's what i'm looking for 

228.35 229.11 A: yeah 

229.33 231.67 B: but it seems to me such a carnal thing with him 

232.56 234.99 B: and that i don't i don't know 

232.68 233.58 A: you think [noise] 

235.55 236.57 B: i mean 

237.01 237.91 B: (( i guess )) 

239.26 240.27 B: i don't know 

242.29 245.27 B: i i he's not my favorite one they've had yet 

245.48 251.22 A: [mn] now see i've only watched this one and the one before the one with trista the bachelorette 

249.14 249.92 B: really 

251.07 252.93 B: (( right what did you think of that one )) 

252.94 259.59 A: i totally wanted her to pick ryan and didn't think she would and so i was so excited when she did [laughter] 

259.39 265.00 B: i agree and i think that she caught so much bad publicity for it due to the fact that she was a female 

265.35 272.51 B: and that really bothered me yeah about how she kissed too many men and she did this she did that and i that kind of irritated me a little bit 

265.49 266.47 A: really 

266.69 267.55 A: hm 

271.82 278.02 A: oh you see i didn't hear that but no i d- no one's saying that about this new guy it doesn't seem like 

272.57 273.50 B: because 

277.03 282.65 B: exactly and he's kissing every one of them [laughter] every day [laughter] 

280.05 284.09 A: [laughter] and he gets upset when he gets a cheek [laughter] 

283.71 287.46 B: [laughter] i know [laughter] so true 

287.16 288.91 A: like good for you girls 

289.19 297.94 B: [laughter] i don't know i just think that i mean seriously i think the whole reason why i watch it is just to simply live vicariously through others 

297.29 298.61 A: mhm 

298.64 305.36 B: you know and to see maybe how the other side of the world thinks because a lot of my single girlfriends are like oh we do th- we do exactly that 

305.82 306.68 A: hm 

305.97 307.43 B: and it's no different 

307.44 308.37 A: right 

307.71 311.75 B: because i would never i don't think i could ever sell my soul and do that [mn] 

312.39 314.21 A: no i don't think i could either 

313.47 315.80 B: [laughter] 

315.63 316.66 A: (( [laughter] huh-uh )) 

316.05 319.23 B: i mean oh have you watched that one extreme makeovers 

319.39 320.86 A: i haven't seen that one 

321.11 328.09 B: oh it's on after the bachelor [mn] these people have like thousands of dollars of cosmetic surgery 

329.84 330.84 A: (( [mn] hm )) 

330.64 336.07 B: and then like reappear to their family and like these women leave their husband and kids for like six weeks 

336.28 338.66 A: [mn] and do they know what they're going to do 

338.61 347.80 B: yeah they're having like face lifts and lasix and tummy tucks and breast augmentation and it's a very interesting show 

340.78 341.91 A: oh wow 

348.77 353.46 A: oh here's another reality t._v. show i watch although i don't know if you'd call it reality um 

354.22 358.84 A: oh i used to watch it when i had cable what's the name of it trading spaces 

359.08 360.51 B: oh i love that show 

360.13 371.42 A: [laughter] isn't that one good [laughter] now see that one i like because i'm like oh i could do that in my house or it gives me ideas to be daring with colors that i would paint my walls or 

362.30 363.20 B: yes 

366.53 367.79 B: exactly 

369.04 369.98 B: right 

371.70 372.87 B: right 

371.96 373.25 A: things like that 

374.06 376.18 B: nah i really liked that show too 

377.64 378.75 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

378.94 379.66 B: (( [mn] )) 

380.13 381.38 A: [mn] do you ever watch 

380.41 381.52 B: (( trying to think of )) 

381.47 395.14 A: oh go ahead [laughter] do you ever [laughter] do you ever watch the one um like the ones about i don't know police shows and [mn] all those kind of reality shows 

381.58 382.44 B: i'm sorry 

383.44 384.45 B: go ahead 

385.33 386.20 B: [laughter] 

395.08 397.87 B: not really they kind of leave a bad taste in my mouth 

397.52 398.95 A: yeah me too 

399.09 399.97 B: so 

399.64 406.24 A: but it seems like okay that's private you know i don't really want to know all this this is kind of weird 

404.26 405.58 B: exactly 

405.96 409.98 B: i kind of tr- tend to gravitate towards the ones that have less scandal in them 

409.82 411.36 A: yeah yeah [laughter] 

410.73 412.39 B: (( [laughter] you know [laughter] )) 

412.61 415.44 B: i'm looking for adventure but not that much adventure 

414.74 417.23 A: yeah yeah 

416.55 422.82 B: um have you ever oh another one that i watched i used to watch a lot was um the show on m._t._v. called the real world 

422.79 428.26 A: [mn] yeah i watched that a long time ago oh see i've never watched the osbournes 'cause i really 

423.14 424.87 B: and then the osbournes [mn] 

428.42 429.43 A: i don't know 

429.90 439.77 A: i was really young when ozzy osbourne was really popular and he just really grossed me out eating grass and stuff i'm like i don't want to have anything to do with that show [laughter] 

435.26 436.64 B: [laughter] 

439.35 445.88 B: [laughter] i think that my my whole problem with it is is um my kids are twelve and thirteen 

445.97 449.43 B: and if my children acted like that i would beat them 

449.56 451.21 B: (( i would be forced to )) 

451.14 452.82 A: so why did you like it [laughter] 

451.27 452.68 B: (( i mean the kids [mn] )) 

454.53 457.88 B: how can people in that much dysfunction actually function 

458.60 468.25 B: i was always waiting to see the moment where they actually function [laughter] [laughter] and it never happened and part of it is is that my husband is a big fan of ozzy osbourne 

468.04 469.00 A: ah 

468.85 472.64 B: he was real into black sabbath so he more got me into it 

472.27 473.59 A: mhm 

472.87 474.46 B: it's very different though 

474.68 479.56 B: i mean i couldn't imagine my girls actually even approaching me in that manner 

479.31 480.19 A: right 

479.95 480.91 B: (( you know )) 

481.55 483.86 B: but [mn] yeah 

484.14 490.50 B: i don't know but i watched the first season and then when i found out they were coming out with the second season i just couldn't bring myself to 

491.56 495.13 B: oh no did you ever watch the anna nicole show 

492.77 493.68 A: yeah 

495.05 495.97 A: huh-uh 

496.06 497.63 B: oh ah 

496.81 498.53 A: i've never even heard of that one 

498.70 501.18 B: y- you know who anna nicole smith is right 

500.77 502.48 A: yeah 

501.99 505.28 B: (( yeah she had her own it was similar to the osbournes )) 

505.17 506.10 A: (( hm )) 

506.56 508.28 B: and she just 

508.62 511.19 B: i watched it once and that was all it took 

511.31 518.18 A: yeah see ones like that like well i haven't seen that one but well i haven't heard of that one but the ozzy osbourne one i just think 

518.20 519.84 A: that's just almost 

521.10 524.04 A: well like you said it's so dysfunctional [laughter] 

524.12 525.46 B: exactly 

525.26 527.83 A: i don't know maybe it makes people feel better [laughter] 

527.61 529.81 B: [laughter] 

528.54 532.30 A: okay maybe things are messed up but at least it's not that bad [laughter] 

531.97 538.79 B: [laughter] that's true that's true [laughter] never thought of it like that 

540.24 547.36 B: [mn] but i don't know i enjoy reality shows and my girls and i watch them a lot together which is 

546.37 547.40 A: mhm 

547.38 548.55 B: so i mean 

549.08 549.88 B: (( i don't )) 

550.26 554.00 A: [noise] so do you let your twelve and thirteen year olds watch like the bachelor with you 

554.94 556.29 B: (( know [mn] )) 

556.52 558.48 A: [laughter] so what do they watch with you 

557.02 557.88 B: no 

558.36 560.96 B: well they've watched joe millionaire with me quite a bit 

560.40 561.29 A: uh-huh 

561.11 563.28 B: and we were really intrigued by that 

563.30 566.59 B: and then um they're into survivor 

566.36 567.67 A: mhm 

567.04 571.72 B: they'll watch it every once in a while because they swear that that's exactly how middle school is for them 

572.17 575.02 B: all about who can survive [laughter] 

572.39 573.76 A: (( ooh )) 

573.90 576.53 A: yeah that's a very good analogy 

576.71 580.39 B: so you know they're like oh i would do that to my friend or i would do 

580.75 581.83 B: (( that you know )) 

582.12 587.82 B: so i mean i think that they it gives them like a different perspective on how others act 

588.02 595.03 B: and it more gives me time to sit down with them and ask them you know would you do that or could you see yourself or 

588.54 589.53 A: right 

594.99 598.00 A: or how would you feel if someone did that to you 

597.70 599.01 B: exactly 

598.37 599.90 A: (( that's probably a good ))
