21.89 36.15 A: i i don't know if it's just like a large flux of it i've never watched this much reality [laughter] television in my life because i used to see like whatever on m._t._v. and what not now it's just like i skip all the sitcoms and go straight to the reality 

26.46 28.32 B: [laughter] 

30.43 31.52 B: mhm 

34.46 38.76 B: i know me too it's ridiculous which ones have you been watching

49.37 58.58 B: oh it was nuts it was like he took the mask off and he's like and i just wanna tell you something you're 'cause they had a psychic come in and give like their astrological profiles 

56.08 57.49 A: [laughter] 

58.50 67.56 B: and he flipped out he's like how are you gonna let a psychic you know dictate who's the right man for you he just looked stark raving mad [laughter] yeah 

62.81 63.49 A: (( [laughter] )) 

65.66 68.97 A: oh my god was he even like good looking and what not 

68.05 71.20 B: no that's the thing and he's only like your average looking guy 

70.63 72.51 A: right right right 

71.31 82.93 B: but then they profiled him the next day on like one of those t._v. shows like excess hollywood and they were like yeah he's he you know says that he's a mascot for a football team or something but he's actually unemployed it's like 

82.41 84.47 A: [laughter] 

82.77 86.48 B: [laughter] like i think she made the right choice [laughter] 

85.25 91.63 A: that's good did you see the um the last episode um i think pete got kicked off was that the last one 

90.33 91.08 B: he 

91.14 95.58 B: oh i don't know i taped it this week i haven't even gotten a chance to sit down and watch it 

93.71 104.21 A: oh oh i don't wanna i don't wanna spoil it for you then [laughter] but ah she kicked off the guy that i thought was like the cutest one of the bunch [mn] and 

96.30 98.89 B: yeah [laughter] that's 

101.81 102.99 B: oh 

103.14 104.64 B: was he the asian guy 

104.58 110.86 A: oh no he was cute too but you know when okay yeah he did get kicked off right but when he um 

107.70 109.72 B: oh yeah 

111.09 116.53 A: when he took off the m- ah mask she said that she was not attracted to him at all 

116.07 117.37 B: really 

116.38 127.15 A: so maybe it could have been because he was asian or what not but i thought he was like really tall like like really i thought he was a really good looking guy too [mn] so i was really surprised when she said that 

118.60 120.07 B: yeah 

124.19 125.40 B: yeah 

126.57 128.10 B: oh my gosh 

127.14 137.90 A: but another good looking guy got kicked off and he was like my personal favorite i'm like oh she's gonna regret it and once he took off the mask she said she was so surprised she's like oh my god he's such a cutie pie 

137.03 140.16 B: ah [laughter] 

137.74 145.32 A: (( [laughter] yeah oh man now she's stuck with all these [laughter] yeah pete seemed like a normal guy too that's what i liked about him like he seemed really )) 

145.32 147.70 B: (( and i was like he was )) 

145.80 147.07 A: (( straightforward he's like )) 

147.50 149.87 A: (( yeah )) 

148.70 163.36 B: i think he was probably like him and peter were probably like the best looking of the bunch and now they're gone yeah yeah yeah i'm not really quite sure what i'm doing right now and it's so like they said in the prompter like why do people like reality shows i think that's why because [mn] you're watching real people that have like the same issues as you do 

161.61 164.51 A: [laughter] exactly 

163.82 166.28 B: it's kinda refreshing it's not like friends 

165.20 167.41 A: like closer to home yeah 

166.61 176.84 B: yeah with this like amazing apartment and they're all supposedly struggling this and that and it's like oh you can totally identify with just being at that point in your life you're like i don't know what i'm doing but [laughter] 

170.32 171.69 A: right 

172.09 173.08 A: (( [mn] ))

178.58 187.93 A: you know i did you know i watched the first time it came out but i haven't been like following it at all i was hooked on like temptation island 

181.08 182.19 B: mhm 

187.07 188.62 B: oh yeah 

187.87 194.00 A: and i was really upset when like they're not i don't think they're playing it any more or wasn't it 

192.26 194.61 B: i know it was so much fun 

194.21 199.84 A: it's the trashier it is the more i love it you know i'm a sucker for trash and like [laughter] 

196.52 198.65 B: exactly [laughter] 

198.99 203.84 B: did you see love cruise a lot of people missed that one but it was so trashy and fun 

201.35 202.21 A: [mn] 

202.31 203.14 A: (( no )) 

203.16 205.14 A: no what what was that about 

204.46 211.41 B: it was evil it was done by the same people who do the real world so you know they know how to like manipulate situations and get mad drama 

208.42 209.75 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

211.06 212.02 A: right 

211.42 223.90 B: it was like they chose like i i think it was like eight women eight men and the way they set it up for humiliation right from the get go 'cause they put 'em on like separate sides of the boat [mn] and they're like run to the person you're attracted to and you wanna hang out with 

217.34 218.58 A: [laughter] 

223.79 228.47 B: so like some women got like three guys with them some women got nobody 

227.54 230.44 A: [laughter] [mn] [mn] oh that's humiliating yeah 

228.88 237.76 B: isn't it yeah and the one woman cried like in the first episode she's like i don't understand nobody likes me it was just oh my god it was awful but it was so entertaining [laughter] 

235.64 236.68 A: [mn] 

237.14 241.26 A: w- was there people being like voted off or something like 

240.05 251.70 B: i'm trying to remember how they voted people off i think they had a series it was a vote that's right it was just like survivor where they would actually vote and it was like whatever couple remained got like some amazing vacation 

246.97 248.11 A: [laughter] 

251.42 252.77 A: right right 

252.12 265.35 B: but it was cool the way they set it up because they picked attractive people but not models so you could see where they'd have typical insecurities when you know yeah oh those real world people are evil they just know how to get they just know how to pick people at this point 

258.67 260.52 A: (( i see i see wow )) 

264.26 267.42 A: right oh my god that's hilarious 

265.36 266.04 B: they

270.47 274.43 A: yeah i i've never even hear- i don't remember hearing about this 

273.89 284.31 B: i don't think they hyped it that much and i don't think the ratings were that great i remember it was like october of two thousand two because i remember like what job i had at the time and i was like telling people at work like you have to watch this show 

280.77 282.51 A: [laughter]

288.10 292.10 A: (( really i don't why i don't even why i don't even remember this )) 

291.81 298.68 B: probably because you had like a life at the time like [laughter] because that's the problem with these shows i got way too caught up [laughter] 

293.87 295.73 A: [laughter] 

297.11 310.49 A: it's in college it was like a lot worse if actually if i was in college now right and all and all these real- it'd be ten times worse like than um real world and whatever i was watching back then
