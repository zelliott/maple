51.84 55.54 A: oh you know [laughter] i just i 

55.85 61.62 A: i just can't stand smoking smokers i i mean well i mean not on a personal basis but you know 

60.89 62.63 B: yeah but the whole 

62.07 71.72 A: i mean i know people who are smoke- who i like who smoke who i like very much but i mean just sort of as a thing smoking bugs me more than anything for this type of this 

70.05 71.19 B: yeah 

72.04 85.20 B: it's just like first of all why would you want to suck on something like that you know that burns your chest [laughter] it makes you look so ridiculous and then you know it kills the people around you more than it does you 

85.35 90.26 B: and i it's really inconsiderate to to me i think 

90.32 91.80 B: like i mean i guess 

90.41 91.11 A: which 

92.28 104.05 B: it ah it annoys me when people are talking belligerent but you don't see that so much anymore at least i don't and all of that stuff you know and being overweight when you're sitting on the bus you get squashed but ah 

102.88 103.87 A: yeah 

104.04 108.48 B: (( that's not going to kill me [laughter] so but it )) 

107.66 111.86 A: well you can always stand you know if you really if you really can't stand it but there's 

110.06 111.05 B: yeah 

112.29 121.97 A: yeah i mean i i would never say anything that i mean of course someone who wanted to smoke in my house i would say something but i mean you know those people in the street or whatever i would never say anything to them 

119.02 119.58 B: (( mm )) 

121.77 135.56 A: but i mean i will deliberately like speed up to pass people or slow down to let them get ahead of me so that i can avoid their smoke but i wouldn't but i don't think i'm obvious about it i hope not i mean i don't want to be rude really i guess but 

127.76 128.70 B: yeah 

135.45 139.34 A: but i do really go out of my way to try to avoid it 

138.87 148.25 B: see i actually i think the smoking thing is rude anyway so i i have said things to people especially like if i'm sitting at the bus stop i was there first 

142.69 144.18 A: well yes [laughter] 

148.52 158.88 B: and you know they come and sit down with a cigarette or they light up a cigarette after they've sat down and i'll be like you know i mean i have asthma i'm allergic to many of the things in the smoke anyway 

158.87 170.18 B: so i have a serious problem with it so i usually like you know i really have a problem with cigarettes health wise can you please not smoke here can you go over there and i've found that for the most part when you're civilized about it 

170.10 174.49 B: people are willing to obey but this was also in utah 

174.71 184.17 B: so [laughter] i'm orig- i'm originally from ut- well actually i'm originally from georgia but like my mom and i are in utah now i'm just going to school here i'm studying

193.86 195.01 B: (( it yeah )) 

193.99 195.96 A: why are you in utah 

196.05 205.46 B: like she we moved out there because she finished grad school she want- yeah so jobs economy out there's [noise] great and she got an offer so

205.72 215.50 B: you know that's where we ended up but it we've been there for thirteen years it was supposed to be a short stint until she could find something else but [laughter] thirteen years later here we are [laughter] 

214.80 218.43 A: well i've i went to college in utah 

218.00 219.64 B: (( oh you did where'd you go )) 

219.21 220.48 A: b._y._u. 

220.36 222.04 B: (( ah foo )) 

221.31 227.20 A: hm yes well um i no longer am associated with that group 

222.41 224.04 B: (( ah foo )) 

227.35 228.27 B: (( uh-huh )) 

227.35 228.41 A: but um 

228.84 230.03 A: but um 

229.06 231.36 B: that's a whole story i have 

230.81 231.95 A: i'm sorry 

231.75 233.79 B: i said that's a whole another story i 

233.01 243.53 A: yes it is and um i'm perfectly willing to talk about that but um i'm not sure how i know they're recording these things i don't know what i really don't know what they're studying 

238.00 239.25 B: i i think we're 

240.50 241.49 B: yeah 

243.74 244.71 A: um 

244.75 253.87 B: i'm [noise] i've got their information somewhere and they want us it's something about people and their interaction and use of language if i'm not mistaken because it's part of the 

252.50 254.08 A: yes but i'm 

254.68 255.76 B: (( yeah )) 

255.45 263.13 A: you know i mean they don't seem to be zapping us if we move away from the topic a little bit but ah yeah well um 

259.87 260.90 B: [laughter] 

261.20 265.85 B: (( yes i mean i'm sure they have to know that people are going to steer a little so )) 

265.12 280.01 A: sure yeah sure and i'm wondering if there might be something else that they're studying you know like how topics move and from one thing to another or something but who knows but of course if they don't want us to know that because if we know that 

266.23 267.05 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

272.51 274.02 B: (( yes we )) 

277.99 278.81 B: (( then we may )) 

280.63 282.20 B: (( consciously the whole study )) 

280.75 283.48 A: or unconsciously skew the thing so 

283.02 284.86 B: yeah 

284.02 287.41 A: anyway yeah well i i don't know 

287.61 288.65 A: um 

288.79 290.44 A: utah huh well 

290.51 291.38 A: i 

290.82 300.18 B: yes it's interesting though you would think in utah you don't get so many smokers which i found like coming out here like everybody smokes but 

300.60 310.18 B: it seems to be much more pervasive in utah to me i don't know maybe it's because it's like such a clean place anyway and then somebody comes and disrupts your little environment 

310.38 315.72 B: and you're like wait a minute like meanwhile being in phili it's like everywhere you turn there's cigarette smoke 

315.56 319.07 A: well you know it's interesting because i recently read a 

316.20 316.88 B: (( so )) 

319.13 325.58 A: something somewhere um about how the percentage of people smoking are going down 

325.52 334.70 A: um and it was ah of course like it seems to me it was like in the middle twenties of people who smoked 

326.11 326.85 B: (( yeah )) 

334.75 339.03 A: um and you know then they had other things about you know 

339.05 342.93 A: men and women and regional things but ah 

343.08 349.34 A: i know yeah i mean i've lived in california more or less my whole life except for when i was in utah and um 

349.37 350.38 A: (( ah )) 

350.77 353.65 A: when i went back to um 

353.84 361.34 A: washington d._c. a couple of years ago just on a little trip to you know see all the washington d._c. things um 

354.74 355.41 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

361.77 373.69 A: it was just so shocking to go some place where you know they wanted to know whether you wanted to be in the smoking or the non-smoking section where 'cause in california they just don't allow it i mean they don't allow smoking 

368.08 369.37 B: (( yeah the )) 

371.74 373.71 B: (( same thing as in utah )) 

374.21 382.67 A: they don't allow smoking in restaurants they don't allow smoking in bars they don't allow smoking in anything you know i mean and um 

380.65 385.83 B: mm yeah i found really interesting because like even down in georgia the restaurants 

385.85 387.21 B: are pretty much 

387.39 401.83 B: all smoke free like there are some it's not a state law like they don't have a clean air act like they do out in utah but now here it's kind of like do you want smoking or non-smoking and the smoking table's right next to the non-smoking table and you're like is there a point [laughter] you know mhm of 

401.51 414.44 A: you know i went we ate in a some place in in ah virg- er um alexandria you know and the salad bar was in the smoking section and it was like oh gross you know 

413.48 416.27 B: (( course now my salad tastes like cigarettes )) 

415.52 423.88 A: [laughter] yeah so i it was it was you know it's but it's been it's very o- odd going some place else 

416.73 417.68 B: [laughter] 

424.06 427.82 A: um because california is so strict um 

427.02 439.92 B: yeah i think you guys are the only ones with the bar thing like you're supposed to be able to smoke in a bar i think but it's nice to know that i can go to california and go to a bar if i wanted to and like not have to worry about suffocating death [laughter] 

427.90 429.14 A: about this 

439.42 441.24 A: (( yeah ah )) 

440.21 449.33 B: but that that is really interesting it's it was a definite thing for me that i had to get used to coming out here especially when i came to the school like 

449.41 453.75 B: things are smoke free pretty much on campus except for being outside obviously 

453.49 454.32 A: yes 

453.66 465.04 B: so when i finally started like going out and eating out i was like what do you mean like smoking and non smoking like you can't smoke it's a building [laughter] and then i realised no yes you can yeah mm 

464.88 477.35 A: well there is a small town i i'm not sure how much i am supposed to tell you i i live in ventura county which is just north of los angeles and the and one of the smaller towns in the county actually doesn't allow smoking outside 

476.90 478.14 B: oh wow 

477.43 487.69 A: um i mean like well i mean i'm not sure exactly how strict it is but i mean like walking up down the street in the business section you can't smoke on the street it is illegal 

487.71 495.50 A: i'm assuming they let you smoke in your own backyard or whatever but i don't i i don't know the detail but they don't allow smoking on the street 

490.32 491.43 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

495.35 505.02 B: i mean i really think it should be because it's a serious health hazard yeah right [laughter] but it's a serious health hazard i think for other people 

496.03 497.66 A: and 

497.76 500.69 A: so you should move there [laughter] 

501.10 502.17 A: (( yeah )) 

503.46 505.62 A: it is it is 

504.89 513.52 B: and it's like if you can't drink and drive which obviously makes sense like why is it okay to like smoke and endanger everyone around you 

513.61 517.16 B: you know it's a especially i think even over time 

517.43 527.37 B: that you know you if you live in a city or somewhere where there's a lot of smoking going on even if you don't smoke yourself you're going to get enough and it's going to affect you in some way 

526.54 527.89 A: i think so 

527.91 533.15 A: and someone like yourself it sounds like you're already susceptible to um 

533.47 542.00 A: you know like you know i'm assuming like respiratory problems and and whatnot um it would be um even worse 

534.20 535.16 B: (( yeah )) 

536.81 538.06 B: yeah 

541.76 542.75 B: yeah 

542.11 546.00 A: but yeah i just i just can't stand smoking 

545.68 549.72 B: it's it's everything about is just awful to me i think 

550.02 550.90 B: so 

551.34 553.37 A: um okay 

552.31 557.68 B: i mean they're all all the things that they listed were pretty bad vices i think but 

558.10 572.76 B: you know like if someone chooses to be that generally doesn't have too much affect on my life whereas if they're smoking i mean drinking alcohol the way they put it was kind of vague i'm like well like i drink every now and then like not generally that often but 

573.05 579.46 B: you know i still don't drive um and if you know me and my friends were all to the point you know if we ever 

579.58 584.99 B: anybody who had one drink was not allowed to drive and if one person had to drive everyone home 

585.36 587.71 B: you know and we left the cars 

587.96 591.07 B: you know something like that then that's what happens but 

590.32 598.72 A: yeah well you know there's there's drinking and drinking and there's overeating and there's overeating but smoking is always disgusting 

591.34 592.36 B: you know 

598.38 599.95 B: yeah exactly like there's no 

598.93 599.89 A: [laughter]
