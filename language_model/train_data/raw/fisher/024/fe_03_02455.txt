15.44 17.97 A: houston okay i'm in syracuse new york 

17.45 20.06 B: oh quite a little distance there 

19.13 21.11 A: yes a little bit of distance 

20.58 21.59 B: (( ahah )) 

21.63 24.48 A: so i guess the topic is ah reality 

23.95 25.85 B: reality shows 

25.18 27.44 A: i don't watch 'em do you 

27.20 30.80 B: well i did watch a couple when they first came out 

30.04 36.08 A: did you i i might have seen maybe one or part of an episode of survivor but that's about the extent of it 

35.41 40.59 B: [mn] i watched one that was filmed in ah i think it was belize 

40.76 48.62 B: and it was called it wasn't fantasy island but it was something like fantasy island the name not the show 

47.74 49.61 A: (( okay i ah )) 

49.60 50.42 B: (( ah )) 

49.89 64.46 A: doesn't ring a bell with me as i say i probably seen oh maybe a few minutes of ah one of the first few survivors but that was about the extent of it and i did read something here very recently that they're they're talking about a ah whole network on sur- ah reality t._v. 

63.40 66.56 B: oh you're kidding like a cable channel 

64.35 65.61 A: yeah 

65.97 68.39 A: ah yup just exactly like that 

67.45 72.32 B: right now w- instead of having animal planet we'll have e- erotica planet or 

70.84 73.37 A: [laughter] who knows 

73.02 75.36 B: exotica planet 

74.09 75.31 A: (( yeah [cough] )) 

75.65 77.71 A: no i think i think they're overdoing it 

77.77 82.94 A: [mn] but apparently it must work they must make money for the networks they i guess they wouldn't ah put 'em on otherwise 

82.39 88.54 B: [mn] well you know when you consider that somebody like anna nicole smith can have her own ah 

87.76 89.13 A: (( oh yep )) 

88.66 91.60 B: her own channel or her own program 

90.41 91.79 A: (( [cough] yeah [cough] )) 

92.13 94.85 B: then you think anything's possible 

94.10 99.15 A: well that's it the junk they put on television ah is ah is is unbelievable at times [lipsmack] [lipsmack] 

98.69 103.36 B: [mn] yeah it really is and i i you know i think that the cable industry 

103.38 109.54 B: makes a mistake by not giving you a like a cafeteria plan where you can go in and pick what you want 

109.89 113.92 B: and pay accordingly or let you pay by show 

113.64 118.50 A: well w- we do have that up here there it's almost like a pay per view yes 

115.75 117.54 B: do you really 

118.75 122.07 B: so what could you get i mean can you get these ah 

121.63 122.19 A: (( [mn] )) 

122.41 125.12 B: these ah reality shows or 

124.24 131.53 A: well i don't know if you can get that the the the biggest ah group utilizing that are the real sports fans and that 

131.86 142.15 B: yeah well we have pay for view where you can get blocks of sports and blocks of movies and order this and that but [mn] you know i'd like it so i could order if 

131.99 132.85 A: (( th- [mn] )) 

142.41 145.61 B: [mn] [cough] pardon me if i wanted to watch reality shows 

145.83 151.48 B: which i i don't um but i could you know dial in like you do a sports show 

152.10 159.52 B: and pay for it and if then if a week later i want to watch something on the history channel dial it and pay for it 

157.57 166.71 A: yeah yeah yeah [mn] well as i say something similar to that in sports a- and there are some other programs but i some of the other types of programs it just doesn't ring a bell to me right now 

166.52 172.01 B: so why do you think that the viewing public likes this salacious kind of garbage 

171.71 177.82 A: [mn] i don't know it's beyond me you know after you you watch one of them they're pretty much the same in my opinion [mn] [mn] 

178.74 182.23 B: have you seen the previous or the latest one where all these 

182.33 187.35 B: i i think it's like twenty or twenty five men and they all wear different colored masks 

186.69 191.32 A: oh yes yes yes yeah i did see the preview for that yeah 

188.25 189.85 B: and one woman 

190.75 194.39 B: who would wanna make time with someone wearing a mask 

193.28 202.63 A: [laughter] who knows who knows but there's gotta be money in th- in it for these contestants and everything so ah i guess that's what the real motivation is 

202.46 208.40 B: yeah well now you know why the the islamic culture thinks that we're degenerate we are 

207.90 212.39 A: well we are in a way is right exactly yep just out for the 

209.47 210.85 B: yeah we are 

211.24 212.84 B: and it's pitiful 

212.44 214.77 A: just out for the thrill of it a lot of times 

214.50 220.53 B: on the other hand if i got a chance to participate in one of those shows i'd probably do it 

220.14 224.64 A: i probably would too if you you know you d you put enough money to make sure 

224.90 228.57 B: yeah well that's part of the problem it's greed you know 

226.74 230.90 A: yeah well it's that do- motivated by the almighty dollar is right

235.53 239.01 B: iraq that found those big boxes of money 

238.45 239.69 A: exactly 

239.19 242.75 B: there were some that just couldn't keep their hands off of it 

240.99 245.17 A: oh that w- w- i mean w- i often say to myself what would i have done 

245.54 253.11 A: [mn] you know in that situation would i stash a few hundreds away or a few bundles away oh you- you'd think about it that's for sure yeah 

252.38 256.69 B: i wouldn't say i wouldn't do it or i wouldn't say i would ah you know that's 

256.80 261.98 B: i'm not that ah rigid that i'd say absolutely i'd never do it but 

261.03 269.23 A: oh i w- i wouldn't say that either it's like you know if you were driving down a freeway and ah there were an armored truck in front of you and a bag fell off of it what would you do 

269.31 271.51 B: [mn] hijack the truck
