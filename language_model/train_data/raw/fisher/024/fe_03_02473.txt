1.92 4.20 B: hi my name's karen how are you 

4.45 6.18 A: fine thank you how are you karen 

6.03 7.17 B: i'm doing good 

7.05 11.54 A: oh good uh karen i sure don't watch uh reality t._v. do you [noise] 

11.31 17.47 B: well the only thing that i watch and it's always towards the end of the season is the uh [lipsmack] um 

17.64 19.25 B: the survivor show 

19.53 23.77 A: oh you have to tell me then w- what tell me what it's all about i've never seen one 

23.52 25.22 B: you've never seen the survivor show 

25.10 25.80 A: no 

25.37 32.68 B: um well on the the survivor shows they usually have you know x amount of participants that start at the beginning 

32.64 41.16 B: and they usually go thirty to forty days like in the amazon or whatever and um they do contests 

41.22 49.40 B: and um for each contest whoever wins it they get like what's called an immunity necklace and um 

47.69 48.60 A: okay 

49.62 55.95 B: 'cause after the every contest they go and they uh boot somebody off the island they 

55.87 57.10 B: vote 'em off 

57.00 71.52 B: so if you have the immunity necklace then you can't get booted off they can't vote you off so i always like to watch towards like the last couple of three weeks because they're down to like four or five people and then you kinda go hm who's gonna win [laughter] 

57.22 58.09 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

62.30 63.24 A: okay 

70.64 81.15 A: oh my god [laughter] it sounds kind of cruel and humiliating do you find that it has i mean i i think the shows are so misnamed it's such a misnomer to say reality 

80.73 82.49 B: yeah it's not 

81.49 82.24 A: y- 

82.27 87.57 A: yeah like i always go into the amazon or wherever that's real [laughter] 

86.51 91.49 B: yeah well it i think all it's a a challenge of physical physical fitness 

91.36 94.27 B: and basically who 

94.05 107.03 B: you know m- they make alliances with each other and then like two or three people will say well if you vote against this person then i'll help you with this or i'll make sure you don't ever get voted off so you know they kind of do that kind of stuff too 

106.83 112.55 A: oh is it majority rule that um if how many people are there total in the beginning 

112.74 119.91 B: [sigh] i think there's usually like twenty there's like ten and ten and they they put 'em into two separate what's called tribes 

115.87 116.83 A: oh wow 

119.79 121.47 A: [laughter] 

119.97 129.17 B: and then they they're supposed to work as a group and and then it gets down to the point where there's only two people against each other and then um 

122.95 123.85 A: uh-huh 

129.38 138.18 B: i- it then once they get down to i think it's seven people then the other people become part of of um 

138.26 144.83 B: [lipsmack] what is it like a voting panel they get to vote people off not the people that are actually still in the game 

144.98 157.47 B: they get to vote people off so see then it's the the point of well that person voted me off and i think they're a jerk so they'll vote 'em off you know and so it's that kind of part of it is kinda [laughter] 

145.06 146.79 A: oh 

153.17 154.37 A: [laughter] 

156.47 163.53 A: [laughter] so it's vindictive and evil at the end it's not totally merit it's not a merit based thing it's not a democracy based thing 

158.35 159.64 B: yeah 

163.28 175.99 B: basically yeah i mean a- and some of 'em are really good and some of 'em are really vindictive like that it's like you know it's like well i'm going to vote you off because you were a jerk to me and it's like well that's not the way the way that it's supposed to be 

176.05 183.94 B: it's supposed to be who is the best at the physical the challenge the you know the emotional the mental 

176.34 177.25 A: (( it's n- )) 

183.99 185.53 B: that's what i like to see 

184.13 185.16 A: it it's 

185.57 194.28 A: it sounds like it's a popularity contest as well as can you survive eating bugs but do they give the people water and stuff ah [laughter] 

188.96 190.19 B: (( kinda )) 

190.71 192.42 B: [laughter] 

193.53 207.51 B: they get uh the like the first show they didn't give 'em anything and um they had to like earn like fishing hooks and those kind of things to catch and then one of the shows that i watched they actually gave them 

198.05 198.92 A: (( oh )) 

203.78 204.63 A: (( my god )) 

207.70 215.95 B: like rice so much rice um so much fish and that kind of stuff because the people in the one show they they were pretty much starving to death yeah 

209.71 210.65 A: (( [sigh] )) 

210.69 211.50 A: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

215.87 217.14 A: (( oh my god )) 

216.53 224.44 B: so they decided well on the next show we better start giving them at least a ration of rice so then they have to learn how to ration it out until it runs out 

217.95 220.48 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

224.66 226.87 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

224.94 231.91 B: and then so some of the challenges are like the when i watched the last thursday there's one on tonight the last thursday 

231.88 242.22 B: they um they had x amount of dollars and they could uh bid on a food item but they didn't get shown what the item of food was until they were done bidding 

240.28 241.99 A: [laughter] 

242.26 249.32 B: and it was like a steak and a potato i mean and it's just funny to watch these people it's like oh my god it's a steak and potato 

244.66 245.86 A: [laughter] 

250.22 252.13 B: you know and one guy got like a 

251.01 252.31 A: (( that's hilarious )) 

252.32 261.52 B: yeah one guy got like a piece of cheesecake you know and so they're bidding on this you know hoping they're going to get something really good to eat so i think it's funny 

261.39 268.08 A: did they give them anything really stinky like y- you know l- let's make a deal you know like here's a piece of moldy cheese or 

267.86 275.84 B: that's what they do for some of the contests they'll have like um each group they c- say okay you have to come up you have to eat like this nasty bug or you have to 

275.65 283.56 B: swallow whole this raw fish or you have to eat this you know yeah they do do that to see if who's going to lose it you know 

283.80 286.76 A: i mean w- when they were purchasing the food items 

286.18 291.76 B: [laughter] no the food items this time everything was kosher everything was like good food 

286.78 287.96 A: did did 

291.16 296.13 A: oh okay so nobody had to buy with their valuable dollars and ended up getting something really gross 

295.14 300.35 B: no no they didn't do that no i think they would boycott if they did [laughter] 

296.69 298.55 A: oh that's good 'cause that would be awful 

299.63 301.86 A: [laughter] 

301.91 306.46 A: oh i have to sneeze can you hold on a second i oh thank you [noise] 

303.63 304.35 B: (( sure )) 

310.99 313.42 A: sorry allergy season [laughter] 

312.51 317.42 B: the one thing i don't watch things like the bachelor i think that's dumb that's such a dumb show 

317.50 318.47 B: and 

317.54 319.81 A: yeah i haven't gone down that 

318.63 323.69 B: i don't watch what's the other there's some other ones like when the bachelorette 

320.13 320.85 A: yeah 

323.74 326.77 B: i mean i think that stuff's stupid too and the millionaire 

326.58 328.97 A: yeah no sorry 

327.13 328.28 B: and 

328.56 330.85 B: yeah it's like okay 

329.00 329.78 A: yeah 

331.33 332.75 A: yeah i i haven't gone 

331.47 334.04 B: 'cause it never turns out the way they want it to 

334.35 343.03 A: yeah right plus i guess the point is um with so many of those shows and i think there was one recently on on fox s- station and 

335.22 336.27 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] )) 

343.01 347.36 A: i guess somebody the people were supposed to get couples were supposed to be married by america 

347.29 360.26 A: and i as i understand it um none of the couples accepted um being married to one another they were chosen by america and hooked up by america and never met each other before [mn] and and within a matter of weeks they were supposed to get married to one another 

359.93 361.15 B: (( [laughter] oh )) 

360.20 367.61 A: and that but that was a total um fiasco and and of course none of the people said you know oof you know i don't want to commit the rest of my life 

367.64 370.92 A: in [laughter] being married to you [laughter] so 

370.58 371.78 B: yeah 

370.93 371.84 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

372.18 384.28 A: you know it's it's staggering i can't believe the crap that um network e- executives think are are y- you know is going to whet our appetite but what's even more amazing is that advertisers say sure i'll spend millions of dollars paying to 

384.18 388.35 A: uh [laughter] put an advertisement in and pay for this program so 

386.39 387.49 B: yeah 

388.48 394.47 A: oh well and maybe we're all idiots for for watching it but it sounds like you and are aren't at least watching it so that's good 

393.57 400.39 B: [laughter] see that's why i the only one i like is survivor only because it's just 

400.17 410.27 B: um it's not like the bachelor or the bachelorette where it's they're sitting there choosing i mean that's almost like you know like slavery it's like okay i'm going to choose this guy 

409.85 411.59 A: oh it's revolting 

410.27 411.30 B: and 

411.29 417.91 B: well and i don't like that i mean at least with the um the survivor show you know they're doing it for 

417.80 430.45 B: physical fitness and that kind of stuff yeah there's a little bit a you know stuff going on in the background but you know i would be more out to let my kids watch that than i would if i was going have a m- do the bachelorette or whatever it's like okay 

430.40 431.30 A: right 

430.50 433.29 B: you know here and i only get network t._v. 

433.45 437.25 B: i don't i don't pay for cable or any of that kind of stuff 

436.54 438.46 A: [sigh] yeah yeah me too 

437.32 440.85 B: so i don't watch a lot of t._v. because of tho- those kind of shows 

440.76 442.62 A: right right 

442.67 455.98 A: a wise choice yeah i don't know why the current trend is for these reality based shows i guess that the audiences are watching them which i find surprising and i would assume it costs the networks very little to make them to produce them 

456.09 462.09 A: but i find it very surprising that um they're saying that we want to see that stuff 'cause i sure don't 

458.27 459.27 B: yeah 

462.31 464.98 A: um i don't wanna watch that stuff i find it 

465.06 467.41 A: (( pretty damn stupid but )) 

466.32 478.33 B: [laughter] well and then there's this other show um when i was in a hotel room i was watching it on cable and it's basically they put like like eight or ten 

478.18 485.71 B: college slash working people together in like a a great big huge studio apartment type thing 

485.85 493.93 B: um you know one of those great big huge flats and they make 'em all live together and they have to get along 

488.87 489.83 A: okay 

493.86 508.17 B: and they have to like you know dress they have like a communal dressing room a communal bathroom and then the you know their bedrooms are all in separate areas but you know it it they sit there and they film um 

499.89 500.92 A: you're kidding 

508.22 519.79 B: what's going on between the people like when a person pairs up or if this person doesn't get along with that person or that person's talking about that person yeah it's like they threw all these people that don't know each other 

519.72 521.32 A: that's ridiculous [mn] 

519.87 520.70 B: um 

520.73 529.74 B: college age and they film this whole thing and i'm thinking okay what's the point of this whole thing do they get money at the end of it or what's the deal i never did figure out what it was 

529.90 533.42 A: oh my god do you do they get filmed going to the bathroom 

533.68 540.22 B: um they showed a couple of 'em in the bathroom they showed a couple of 'em doing the deed on t._v. too 

540.51 541.61 B: and it's like 

540.59 543.04 A: you are kidding 

542.43 546.54 B: no and it's just like okay like we need to see that 

543.54 545.70 A: oh my god [mn] 

547.18 548.54 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] )) 

547.69 557.53 A: unbelievable i i i'm just i'm i'm completely flabbergasted i can't even think of words to uh describe [laughter] oh my god 

555.60 569.27 B: well and the only reason i sat there and watched it is because i couldn't believe that they would go in and and they would do that it's just like what is this and i never did like i said figure out you know at least with survivor they get a million dollars at the end 

559.48 562.50 A: oh sure i would i would have watched it too [laughter] 

568.93 570.16 A: sure right 

569.52 571.47 B: you know where w- 

570.19 571.33 A: you know that's 

571.73 574.54 B: with this show i have no idea what they do 

574.35 579.30 A: i don't understand that um but i guess you know in college i'm 

579.00 579.62 B: (( [laughter] )) 

579.33 586.74 A: late mid forties forty four um you know we barely had a t._v. it was black and white and you know cable didn't exist back then 

586.06 587.49 B: mhm 

586.54 594.60 A: i can't imagine this that's it's staggering but i guess you know things are so different and that's reality t._v. to watch a whole bunch of people 

594.86 599.89 A: just doing their daily business and then be it sounds like they'd be very gossipy and you know and talking to- 

598.73 599.95 B: yeah
