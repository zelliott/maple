92.79 93.60 A: um 

93.41 108.08 A: even when there's no reason to lie you know what i mean like if someone will call and she never got back to them so just make up a reason instead of the actual reason and stuff like that it makes you wonder how much you know they're telling you lies and how many times she's told you things that you know 

101.34 102.07 B: (( hm )) 

108.25 110.61 A: didn't actually happen but

133.77 135.75 B: i don't know sometimes it's hard to deal with

157.22 159.19 B: yeah so that other one about the 

159.21 161.44 B: exercising i'm like [laughter] 

161.63 167.70 B: i don't know i i'm notoriously bad as far as like exercising outside of dance [laughter] 

167.24 171.63 A: but you but you technically don't you exercise a lot while you're dancing i mean 

171.51 173.98 B: yeah but um most dancers tend to um 

174.97 180.62 B: go to the gym after class and i'm horrible at that i'm just like [laughter] 

176.41 177.34 A: really 

177.94 178.61 A: (( huh )) 

180.10 185.23 A: you have a required amount of of exercises you have to do with your classes and stuff or 

185.29 190.85 B: um well classes themselves take up about four and a half hours a day of just dancing 

190.61 191.51 A: (( mhm right )) 

191.34 192.57 B: so um 

192.50 195.69 A: sounds like enough exercise to me [laughter] 

195.51 196.42 B: yeah 

195.73 197.45 A: do do you smoke or drink 

197.55 199.74 B: i yeah [laughter] which is also 

199.64 200.44 A: okay 

199.82 204.32 B: bad like i i totally don't approve of it i'm like actually trying to quit but [laughter] 

204.86 208.67 A: must be yeah must be you would think like as an athlete you know 

208.37 211.34 B: well it it's kind of strange because growing up like 

211.38 213.37 B: i remember when i was younger um 

213.44 218.48 B: there was i went to the school at the corvallis dance academy 

218.14 218.96 A: uh-huh 

218.63 223.57 B: and every day we had to walk through this cloud of smoke of all the company dancers outside 

222.95 223.90 A: wow 

223.87 228.32 B: and i mean it's like this stigma that goes on that being a dancer is like pretty much 

228.63 230.57 B: i mean a lot of them smoke 

230.21 244.93 A: yeah that's see that's the thing i don't understand because my girlfriend was like that and then she became a vegetarian and you know all this healthy stuff yet she smokes and you know you think like you you have a respect for your body because you're you know basically 

230.60 231.38 B: (( [laughter] )) 

239.05 239.89 B: yeah 

244.85 248.32 A: using it as a you know profession 

248.13 249.15 B: yeah 

248.53 250.50 A: and yet you're you know 

251.13 252.43 A: treating it badly 

252.68 256.85 B: well i think like for personally it's like become my one vice 

256.41 261.98 A: yeah is it nerve thing like that you're nervous about you know what i mean you think that it that's why you 

256.98 257.81 B: (( like )) 

262.08 263.46 A: tend to smoke more 

263.23 276.01 B: i yeah it's like it's a combination of things like um 'cause i know as a dancer you have to like you're supposed to um stick to you know the good food and stuff and you know like i am a vegetarian and i i do everything else is healthy but like 

271.45 272.38 A: right 

273.67 274.56 A: uh-huh 

276.89 279.49 B: because i can't indulge in that i 

278.70 279.65 A: right 

279.57 281.29 B: indulge in something else 

280.80 284.47 A: right and it doesn't have any calories i guess [laughter] 

283.09 286.01 B: yeah it's actually like i 

286.06 288.06 B: a lot of reasons why um 

288.15 294.73 B: not so much any more i um but um because when dancers used to be like anorexic and stuff they would smoke instead of eat 

292.97 293.78 A: right 

294.40 295.29 A: right 

295.14 295.89 B: so 

295.71 298.48 A: it kills your taste buds a little i guess 

297.87 298.97 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

300.56 303.57 A: and what what was the other thing smoking drinking 

303.43 305.71 B: um exercising there was something else 

305.38 308.17 A: oh exercising yeah i don't exercise at all 

308.21 310.19 A: i i have three um 

310.30 314.14 A: children myself i have an eight year old a five year old and a three year old so 

313.85 315.33 B: that makes it kind of hard [laughter] 

314.68 317.32 A: i don't [laughter] yeah i don't have much free time but 

317.23 321.06 A: i'm one of those people that like i've weighed the same since i'm like sixteen so 

320.98 334.27 A: i don't really have a problem with my weight at all but um i guess just like the toning and stuff but it's so i mean by the time i like sit down at eight o'clock it's like the last thing i feel like doing is exercising it 

332.85 335.76 B: [laughter] taking care of kids that age is exercise 

335.47 339.23 A: is it's tiring yeah especially the youngest is you know 

339.28 345.89 A: in the defiant age now and um but i was doing a lot of walking um i was 

341.40 342.31 B: yeah 

345.93 348.93 A: i did a breast avon breast cancer three day walk 

348.65 349.56 B: mhm 

349.11 350.39 A: and um 

350.49 359.55 A: it you know a lot of training 'cause it's like a sixty mile walk over three days so i did a lot of walking over the summer but i haven't really done much since that 

357.08 358.27 B: yeah 

358.61 360.99 B: i've i've actually found that walking is 

361.25 366.27 B: like the one thing that i because i remember wh- when i was at the age i have two younger brothers too 

366.56 371.85 B: and i was about twelve and my mom got she just um i don't know if you- you've ever heard of mall walking 

371.68 374.09 A: yeah they have like these little clubs 

372.23 373.06 B: yeah 

374.06 387.01 B: yeah and you just walk around the mall before the store opens and but she got me mall walking and over i think over the course of like six months i think i lost thirty pounds as a twelve year old [laughter] 

377.88 378.80 A: uh-huh 

384.23 385.10 A: wow 

385.94 388.24 A: wow were you overweight as a twelve year old 

388.07 393.67 B: a little bit but not like extremely i like really like thinned down to a real and i think 

388.96 389.78 A: uh-huh 

393.88 395.33 B: m- because of 

395.45 400.62 B: because we did it like two of us in the morning for one so it like gets the metabolism going and everything and then 

397.72 398.55 A: uh-huh 

399.43 400.69 A: right 

401.16 404.80 B: i don't know it just like because i i ate whatever i wanted 

404.65 405.53 A: uh-huh 

405.17 416.06 B: it wasn't like i did anything else i just walked like we did like two or three miles in the morning every morning and ah that was it and i don't know i personally think it's the best because it's low impact and like 

410.56 411.37 A: wow 

415.42 416.24 A: right 

416.23 421.12 B: i remember most of the people who were there were like you know older senior citizen type 

419.05 419.87 A: right 

420.13 425.06 A: mhm and it's good to do in the mall because you don't have to worry about the weather and all that 

423.76 425.12 B: yeah 

426.75 429.86 B: so yeah that's actually my favorite thing too [laughter] 

429.87 431.35 B: is just go for a walk 

430.45 432.76 A: i find it to be a little boring but 

433.15 438.73 B: yeah well it helped that i was like that i would have my mom to go with you have someone to talk to 

436.64 447.91 A: right you need someone to talk with yeah i had a girlfriend of mine that i would i would go walking with and we ended up just like complaining about work [laughter] you know and stuff like that or our husbands and you know

474.38 475.21 B: uh-huh 

474.74 489.00 A: like i did this initially like months ago i can ah i don't know it was like two months ago and i got like one call and then everything stopped and then they said they guess they were having some problems with their platform or something but they wanted everyone to like re um 

485.61 486.74 B: oh and then they 

488.93 489.93 B: re start 

489.23 497.72 A: re- like yeah i guess like re sign up and um put the times that they were available and all that so i did all that to reactivate it and then i still didn't get any phone calls 

497.51 511.07 A: and my sister is also doing it and she she received two more phone calls so then i'm like i'm going to look at the email again because i remembered the number and i'm like oh let me try this so i just called and did it myself today so this is my second call altogether how many have you done

516.24 517.09 A: uh-huh 

517.06 523.16 B: and the topic was food and then um and then they called me yesterday and i figured just get all three calls 

518.46 519.27 A: (( oh )) 

522.87 526.40 A: right is that all they're allowing is three calls or 

526.01 532.93 B: um yeah for one study it's three calls and then if you have like five different phones you can sign up for that one and they want twenty five callers 

530.23 531.07 A: uh-huh 

532.62 533.49 A: wow 

533.34 534.11 B: so

540.12 541.07 B: mhm 

540.57 544.45 A: wow but you have to you have to call from the different phones is that how it works 

543.72 551.00 B: yeah i think they they're um testing not only like the way people converse but like the way they converse in different format

562.30 563.79 B: [sigh] [laughter] 

564.28 571.77 A: well we have about twenty seconds i thought they were supposed to well maybe it's like a minute i think i started the timer sooner but i thought they were supposed to give us like a three minute warning 

571.65 578.15 B: oh no they the way they did it yesterday they just cut you off at the ten minutes and then they give you thirty seconds to say goodbye 

577.44 578.67 A: (( oh okay )) 

579.37 580.22 B: yeah
