25.18 27.12 A: do you watch reality shows 

26.47 30.38 B: no no go ahead you can talk a couple of minutes and i'll and i'll and i'll rebuttal 

29.83 32.86 A: okay [mn] um well survivor 

31.63 34.20 B: well first of all what what do you think of 'em 

33.60 43.56 A: well tonight's survivor um they're not really i don't really think that they're reality shows they're ah a bunch of ah most of the time spoiled people that um 

43.84 54.70 A: [mn] are very out of touch with reality it seems like especially after they're on the show very long ah the real world is one my wife watches all the time and annoys the hell out of me um [lipsmack] 

53.01 53.93 B: right 

54.66 62.50 A: but it's just a b- it seems like it's a bunch of people trying to be friends and buddies and and be fake and ah i really don't think there's anything real about it 

61.87 74.69 B: well i think y- ah th- they know they're gonna be on t._v. there's producers directors so they know you know i i i i apparently think that they know exactly wh- what they got it's like a script almost 

74.11 75.65 A: right 

74.82 77.03 B: you know it's not like there's hidden cameras 

76.92 80.05 A: (( [mn] yeah well )) 

78.16 81.02 B: you know if if that you know something like that would be 

81.03 83.91 A: i i think it's um just like oh 

82.54 94.98 B: i've never really watched them to tell you the truth i try to stay away from 'em 'cause they don't pique my interest at all for t._v. t._v.'s something you know you want something like [mn] written stories you know like n._y._p._d. or even comedy you know 

94.70 108.83 A: i like the comedy better than the drama shows you know i don't really hoe much into those either the um thing about reality shows that i think ah interest people is everybody i ever talk to and and ah see out they always talk about 

108.68 122.52 A: oh i could win that game or i could do better than they could but i i think ah what we see [mn] the finished product is on most of these shows a week worth of filming in an hour um we don't see a whole lot of really what's going on 

111.38 112.38 B: right 

122.02 122.96 B: right 

122.73 125.96 A: and i think that's kinda kinda sad too ah 

124.44 131.60 B: right there's i think if there was more bickering behind the scenes and more fighting and more you know controversy people would watch it more 

131.09 136.53 A: i'd be interested to see i'd i'd be interested to talk to somebody actually talk to somebody that's been on one 

136.16 137.26 B: (( oh okay )) 

136.68 139.32 A: because i think it's funny um 

139.19 154.09 A: they find a a flaw or a problem with somebody and they really exploit it every time they do that [mn] they show it over and over again they show it in the commercials and and i think a lot of times [mn] some of these people that they call jerks on the reality shows are probably pretty nice people 

153.70 154.62 B: right 

153.96 164.89 A: but they found the flaw or the problem and i wouldn't want to be on one and and have them point out the problems i have you know week after week after week 'cause i think they really blow that up and make it ah into a bigger issue 

160.18 161.38 B: right 

164.33 169.54 B: right and i guess you know they're trying i mean it first started out with one what was the first one sur- 

168.67 173.76 A: well i thought i i'm sure there was something before survivor but i think it was the first big one 

173.30 174.52 B: right 

173.98 176.88 A: um [mn] i don't know what the first one 

176.07 179.78 B: now they got millionaire how to marry a millionaire bachelorette 

179.13 190.74 A: see those are the ones that annoy me i i can't even stand to watch those now survivor i still watch um sometimes but the the joe millionaire the um how to want to marry a millionaire 

187.19 188.06 B: right 

189.97 202.42 B: there was a q- there was a question on my internet and it had you know there's a daily question it had ah if there was a reality channel like a t._v. show t._v. channel just for reality shows would you ever tune in 

202.19 203.89 A: right 

202.72 209.28 B: and i i put no myself and then i could see the results [mn] and believe it or not about three to one 

209.38 212.18 B: were were not w- wouldn't watch this [lipsmack] 

211.87 226.73 A: really ah i wonder who's i mean they're getting good ratings ah so somebody's got to be watching my wife goes to a website called ah television without pity it has a bunch of reality show stuff on there and and ah it's fairly interesting now 

212.54 213.86 B: yeah 

216.12 217.06 B: yeah 

217.63 218.89 B: oh of course 

221.33 222.21 B: okay 

223.74 224.80 B: (( reight )) 

225.98 229.37 B: now now on like like on a on a cable show 

229.02 229.97 A: uh-huh 

229.66 233.18 B: like g. string divas or something if you got some stuff you c- well 

232.89 235.00 A: taxi cab confessions 

234.36 237.61 B: the well that's like the kind of reality i would watch 

237.12 243.41 A: [cough] well i've we've watched something um this week we've been watching a a show called the manor house on p._b._s. 

242.87 243.85 B: (( okay )) 

243.66 252.45 A: which is very interesting and it took people into the edwardian times and um they had to live as servants and then that other family lived as the 

252.59 253.32 A: (( ah ah )) 

253.82 265.07 A: ma- the owners of the house and those are very interesting to me because it seems like um [mn] they're not playing a game i think the games the the whole game show idea of this television 

261.33 262.26 B: okay 

265.29 272.08 A: series ah reality series things really are are what's annoying to me more so than than the show itself 

271.52 274.03 B: is the fear factor like a reality show 

273.56 286.36 A: beats me i never saw it don't care anything about it i saw the commercials on t._v. and this this whole thing about them eating worms and bugs i don't understand how i- it's not really fearful it's gross 

274.87 276.25 B: oh you never saw it 

276.90 277.97 B: (( okay )) 

278.97 279.96 B: right 

281.09 282.28 B: right 

285.82 287.06 B: right right 

286.46 290.29 A: it seems like that that's what they're trying to get into more is is gross on there to me 

289.63 291.63 B: right well it's all for money 

291.42 293.49 A: it's all for money that's right 

292.21 294.41 B: like even ev- even the reality shows 

294.20 300.50 A: now one that i watched ah last week on i think it was on f._x. was um oh 

300.97 303.35 A: [mn] it wasn't 

303.43 306.93 A: it was it was about scaring people basically that that hide cameras 

306.52 307.46 B: okay 

306.85 308.39 A: and um 

308.28 323.10 A: they would tell somebody you know they got hidden cameras in the truck and they put a train on the train track and act like a train's coming at it and they can't get out and just scare people now that's interesting for me to watch i'd probably be pissed off if somebody did that to me but ah it it was very interesting to watch 

312.83 313.81 B: right 

315.52 316.46 B: okay 

319.87 321.07 B: [laughter] 

322.45 332.67 B: right right bec- ah the the reality shows w- i think it would be better if they didn't know that they were going to win money until the very end of some- when somebody did like last 

332.16 335.30 A: well that's kind of how they joe millionaire though 

334.92 335.92 B: okay 

335.41 338.21 A: um ah did you watch any of it 

337.30 342.77 B: nah no i just read it i just read some articles in the paper about how they were all duped he wasn't even a millionaire or something like that 

342.08 352.49 A: right he wasn't a millionaire and you know supposedly at the end of the show he didn't know but they give him a million dollars at the end of the show they give him a million dollars he's supposed to be a construction worker yeah well 

351.90 353.05 B: oh okay 

352.32 358.22 A: it was interesting to watch 'cause i'm i'm originally from arkansas and grew up around farming and all and he's supposed to be 

355.17 356.10 B: right 

358.09 368.25 A: ah this construction guy and when he first got on the show he walked in with his his working clothes supposedly and [mn] he was talking about his shirt being ripped up and he said he got it caught in a combine 

359.41 360.47 B: mhm 

367.89 368.79 B: okay 

368.42 382.92 A: [mn] ah you know i grew up around a farm you get a a shirt caught in a combine you're going to be all minced up but you know it's just a bunch of a bunch of bull and ah i think that's what the producers of the show they try to make these people you know who they're not 

372.35 373.74 B: you're going in with it 

375.11 376.03 B: right 

381.56 384.16 B: now aint monica lewinsky supposed to have one now 

383.90 386.43 A: um it was on last week i believe but i don't 

385.78 387.40 B: is that a reality show too 

386.98 389.60 A: yeah i don't remember what it was 

388.75 393.75 B: now somebody like her i can't even comprehend how she's in front of a camera all she did was get down on her knees 

393.40 395.05 A: yeah [laughter] 

393.91 395.84 B: (( and become fa- you know what i'm saying )) 

395.31 397.11 A: (( i know i )) 

395.85 398.72 B: and become fa- it takes something like that act 

398.78 405.86 B: which i mean don't get me wrong but but for them to publicize her in the media as being nothing more than what she actually is 

405.87 411.14 B: [lipsmack] and giving her a t._v. show and making her popular it doesn't make goo- good role models for girls 

405.95 406.60 A: (( know )) 

410.76 415.20 A: no it doesn't and and that's part of what's wrong with society now you know 

415.21 420.93 B: right i mean all they always telling girls that well if you do that then you can get your t._v. show just do it to the right person 

415.22 417.11 A: (( [mn] c- )) 

419.08 420.29 A: right 

420.46 421.74 A: that's right 

421.33 422.27 B: you know 

422.29 425.35 A: it's ah it is rather interesting i guess i 

424.49 431.17 B: yeah but i mean like one or two of those shows wouldn't have been too bad but i think they're definitely bombarding the airwaves with them 

430.76 433.76 A: [mn] i know well i guess it's what sells so 

432.99 437.95 B: oh of course they wouldn't be doing it if they didn't get the ratings but why do you think people watch 'em 

435.41 436.58 A: yeah 

437.41 449.57 A: [mn] you got me 'cause i don't so it's you know that's hard to say my wife watches um ah real world constantly because of the bickering and the fighting and and all their little problems that they always have 

440.21 442.18 B: but if you did i mean if you did have to think 

443.89 444.84 B: right 

448.64 450.80 B: well is that people who live in the same house or something 

450.80 451.87 A: um [lipsmack] 

451.89 458.30 A: it's on m._t._v. and it's a bunch of eighteen to twenty one year olds yeah 

456.02 462.71 B: right it had it had to be one of the first ones because i think i i i you know saw that like years ago right 

461.05 469.63 A: actually it probably was one of the first ones and i remember watching the first ah two or three years because it was interesting because they give them all challenges to do 

469.24 470.11 B: (( okay )) 

469.64 471.06 A: and um 

471.18 477.73 A: they had their little conflicts in the house and stuff like that [mn] but now it's w- the same people that were on the first show 

477.50 488.91 A: now they have real world verse road rules and they have th- the same people and these damn people don't even have jobs they don't know what life's really about they go out and play a game for they've been playing a game for five years and ah 

480.00 480.98 B: okay 

484.42 485.32 B: right 

487.15 488.20 B: sure 

488.75 493.94 A: that's irritating to me i i don't think enough young people understand what it's like to have to work any more 

490.11 491.00 B: right 

493.13 498.80 B: no i don't think they do [mn] now these now these people who are on these shows are like so called s- ah 

499.09 507.74 B: co contestants or whatever they they end up making some bucks in the media afterwards right even the people who don't last through the like the um 

501.03 502.74 A: (( right )) 

508.42 509.69 B: (( [lipsmack] survivor )) 

509.59 520.70 A: yeah well i was um listening to on the radio there talking the other day about um a college up in missouri paid ah the guy that was on joe millionaire fifteen thousand dollars to do a one hour speech 

520.10 521.47 B: you gotta be kidding me 

520.87 523.35 A: yeah you know ah ah that's 

522.54 527.92 B: talk about what his how how he how he bullshit do you remember you know how he bsed everybody 

527.45 540.73 A: i guess that that's it i don't know if ah i don't know you know i don't know that's the problem a lot of the students were mad because they they spent you know i assume government money to get him there and they said you know i i'd rather talk to a rock 

536.34 537.31 B: sure 

537.83 538.81 B: right 

540.43 545.61 B: well you figure the guy's you know living his fifteen minutes of fame it's probably gonna last longer for that 

545.01 547.93 A: right and i guess that's what they're all all kind 

546.67 551.01 B: even the second place ah i read in the paper the second place girl that he didn't choose 

550.34 553.34 A: of yeah she's going on playboy isn't she yeah 

551.51 554.53 B: yeah so even she's making her bucks 

553.91 556.97 A: yeah but we're all paying 

554.74 555.70 B: you know 

556.40 560.91 B: right now reality sports reality shows about sports i wouldn't mind watching 

560.53 561.91 A: (( well they doing )) 

560.92 564.29 B: something that interests something that interests me reality shows about a band 

564.72 571.27 A: like i like the behind the music on in v._h. one but it's not really a reality show i think it's more of a 

570.69 571.72 B: okay 

571.36 584.73 A: yeah just i d- i don't really know what you would call that yeah a documentary um they're doing a reality show i saw the other day on nascar they're going to start a reality show they're gonna follow one of the drivers around and um 

573.60 575.05 B: that's like a documentary 

576.04 576.96 B: right 

580.10 581.07 B: okay 

584.13 587.23 B: well look that's interesting i mean like they they would probably get 

587.32 589.30 B: an audience you know 

588.91 590.78 A: yeah they'll have their audience 

590.87 599.89 A: [mn] ah but i just don't know how they can make that interesting enough for somebody to watch all the time and but you know i don't see how they make the rest that's interesting for people to watch they do anyway 

595.18 596.27 B: right
