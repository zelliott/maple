17.75 18.71 A: shows 

19.26 25.91 A: no i i kinda [mn] when they first came out i might have looked at 'em for a couple of minutes but um 

27.46 33.79 A: [lipsmack] [sigh] that old guilt that people will do anything for money kinda thing came to mind and i 

31.00 31.89 B: yeah 

33.80 38.75 A: [mn] just didn't think that was anything that i wanted to watch [laughter] 

36.44 37.30 B: well 

37.84 42.25 B: some of 'em are ah a bit reali- a bit unrealistic um 

41.37 42.35 A: yeah 

42.70 51.75 B: i must admit i've watched a few of 'em ah i watched fear factor and i won't watch [mn] i watched it once and i won't watch it again because ah it's 

50.62 52.84 A: now i think i watched that once 

52.38 53.99 B: (( a little strange )) 

53.38 56.05 A: yeah that was just really bizarre 

55.42 56.76 B: especially when they're 

56.84 59.31 B: eating bugs and [mn] stuff like that 

58.35 61.37 A: i watched em in a tank full of snakes 

60.79 62.26 B: [laughter] 

61.65 68.93 A: trying to get hockey bugs off the bottom and i just you know i i i just said wow you know [laughter] 

64.00 64.83 B: (( [mn] )) 

66.52 67.64 B: [laughter] 

68.95 70.01 B: well i watched 

69.15 71.81 A: that's just carrying it a little bit too far 

70.93 75.19 B: [laughter] i watched celebrity and um 

76.15 78.47 B: [mn] i thought that was interesting 

78.23 84.57 A: i think it was a celebrity one i think that's the reason the only reason i watched it was 'cause it was a celebrity one 

84.60 92.40 B: okay this the one i watched was oh several weeks ago and it was help get me outta here i'm a celebrity ah they put 'em in ah 

92.45 95.20 B: i believe they put em in australia 

95.11 106.93 A: oh i watched that i watched that for a couple of times i wanted to i think i watched i looked at it for a few minutes and i would just kinda look at it because i think didn't they play it like every day 

106.80 117.13 B: just about i think just about every night and ah it was winter and um i needed something to get my attention [laughter] because i'm not much of a winter person 

109.02 109.95 A: (( ahah )) 

114.67 116.99 A: nothing else was on t._v. 

117.54 118.90 B: i'm sorry 

118.22 122.14 A: i said ah i remember there was like nothing else on television 

121.35 123.13 B: [laughter] 

123.28 131.94 A: so you kinda just watched it and then i wanted to see who was gonna win at the end so then that kinda hooked me but like survivor no 

123.32 124.01 B: i 

127.21 128.26 B: mhm 

129.43 130.40 B: yeah 

131.83 146.75 B: [mn] i think the reason why i watch it is because um it's the life of kind of like um you get to know somebody through television and ah whereas when you're watching a 

147.31 154.29 B: sitcom it you know that it's just actors and they're pretending and supposedly when you're watching a 

154.41 164.17 B: a reality show it's it's for real but i'm sure they put some things in there just to make it interesting make the show interesting [laughter] 

163.62 164.18 A: (( [mn] )) 

164.89 168.76 B: but ah so you kinda swore off of reality t._v. 

169.87 173.56 B: why do you think you don't want to watch it any more 

173.12 174.27 A: um 

174.59 180.00 A: [mn] i don't know i think i- it's not really real because how often are you gonna be 

180.01 185.62 A: in the outback and you have to you know catch bugs or whatever 

185.66 187.68 A: to eat i i just 

187.52 189.04 B: yeah i agree 

188.42 191.72 A: that's just not a reality a reality 

191.81 196.89 A: [mn] that i would perceive because if i went on a a safari 

197.32 203.04 A: i still wouldn't expect to be eating bugs because i paid to go on this trip [laughter] 

202.75 209.29 B: well the funny what kind of grabbed me in the beginning is they all said oh i didn't expect it would be like this 

208.98 210.09 A: mhm 

209.79 213.50 B: and then i thought oh this is going to be very interesting 

213.55 222.13 B: [lipsmack] and i kind of agree with you ah even though they're in the outback and they did have it pretty much rough 

222.28 233.69 B: um they did have some luxuries that you a normal person in the outback wouldn't have like after so many days of rain they decided the producers decided to 

228.37 230.02 A: (( right )) 

233.75 245.10 B: to get some um some rain trucks in there so that the celebrities wouldn't be complaining so much because they were fed up [laughter] so and you know if you watch like 

241.21 242.57 A: right 

245.74 248.17 B: any other real show 

248.51 252.31 B: ah if they're in the outback they're having a rough time of it 

252.32 254.77 B: from from what i read about ah 

255.06 256.43 B: australia it's 

256.89 258.71 B: pretty rough over there 

258.59 260.31 A: (( [mn] well i don't know )) 

260.01 261.69 B: in that area 

261.44 272.52 A: it's just like it just comes to my mind that people will do anything for money [mn] the price is right you know and [mn] i just think that's just kinda sad 

268.70 269.60 B: [laughter] 

272.69 275.86 B: right i i heard they're gonna have ah i just heard 

276.08 277.06 B: i guess it was 

277.53 282.62 B: last week they're gonna have a reality based network 

282.55 283.34 A: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

282.88 285.23 B: (( [laughter] so )) 

284.60 285.74 A: (( [laughter] oh )) 

285.35 295.10 B: um they're gonna recap on all the reality shows that there are and then i guess they might have one or two of their own for the network 

294.68 295.76 A: [laughter] 

295.34 298.44 B: i thought oh boy there there's no end to this 

296.89 301.95 A: wow they've just kind of taken it to a whole 'nother level 

301.38 305.63 B: mhm i don't know i guess maybe the reason why they 

305.78 311.98 B: decided to start with these reality shows this is what i heard i don't know if it's true or not is because 

312.15 317.13 B: the writers were on strike and they wanted more money and i guess 

317.99 323.86 B: the powers that be decided well we'll just show you we'll start having these unscripted 

321.41 322.43 A: yeah 

322.57 324.56 A: you don't have to write it [laughter] 

324.19 329.13 B: reality [mn] shows that nobody has to write any scripts 

328.57 329.34 A: (( yeah )) 

329.62 332.15 B: so now it just kinda caught on 

332.62 333.88 B: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

333.85 336.70 A: (( whoopee i think ah )) 

336.80 338.15 A: it really 

338.23 342.33 A: they really it really took off when they did that show on m._t._v. 

342.62 344.48 A: called the real world 

343.85 346.64 B: yes that's been on for a while 

344.66 345.68 A: and 

346.00 348.21 A: that's been on for a long time 

347.76 349.69 B: yeah they had another one 

348.38 351.64 A: and they kind of decided they were gonna 

352.17 356.97 A: you know pipe into that and then just kinda take that and run with it 

356.69 362.27 B: oh and they had road rules i don't know if that's like a reality show or not i didn't see that 

361.49 374.65 A: oh kinda except they're in a they're in a camper [mn] instead of in a you know a big house they have to go and they have to do it's kinda like um [mn] i think it was like the predator sort of fear factor kinda 

374.13 375.55 B: oh yeah 

374.59 381.22 A: they have all these tasks they have to perform and that's how they make their money [mn] and that's how they eat if they don't 

376.83 377.85 B: yeah 

381.01 393.71 A: if they don't complete the task or whatever they don't get paid and if they don't get paid they don't eat and those kind of things it kinda forces them to work as a team and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah 

383.05 384.22 B: yeah 

386.12 387.35 B: yeah 

388.38 389.28 B: (( i wat- ))
