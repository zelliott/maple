43.86 54.25 A: here we are yeah i stayed in advertising for a while but now i'm mostly doing the uh the homestead thing [laughter] so yeah so i got a chuckle out of our topic today 

49.24 50.62 B: well good for you 

53.75 56.49 B: i know reality shows do you even watch 'em 

55.02 64.06 A: i know uh well you know what i had resisted them for the longest time and then i caught a couple of episodes of one of the uh 

64.25 76.86 A: the relationship ones not the survivor type things [lipsmack] and then i found myself um catching another episode of one of the more recent ones again was i guess the bachelor the the guy from california the firestone 

67.02 68.24 B: mhm 

75.22 76.23 B: (( oh okay )) 

76.53 77.71 B: yeah 

77.15 79.35 A: yeah what about you 

79.30 89.92 B: uh not really um no uh you know i did when i was in texas i was i just moved back here in the beginning of the year and i spent six years in texas but uh 

80.47 82.11 A: not any of it at all huh 

86.75 87.59 A: oh 

90.73 103.71 B: it it it was funny 'cause i did at one point uh i started watching um the show with the room mates and each week they would cut a room mate out and finally it you know and it was just out of boredom really but um 

103.63 106.42 B: i don't know why they're so popular to be honest with you 

105.02 108.12 A: i well you know what i guess it's like a train wreck 

108.15 112.44 A: it's awful but you just can't tear your eyes from it sometimes when you start watching 

110.30 111.49 B: [laughter] 

112.46 126.45 A: um uh but i think uh one of them though is so bad that i just i couldn't even watch it's like i turned it on and i couldn't hang with it which is uh [sigh] yeah unusual sometimes i mean i'm not saying i'm not a discriminate viewer but [lipsmack] 

126.84 139.12 A: um you know i and i'm not a snob either [laughter] i'll be the first one to say i love to watch t._v. i love to veg out in front of t._v. i just don't have that much time to do it these years [sigh] but uh you know to me it's like mind candy in a way [lipsmack] 

129.52 130.61 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

134.65 135.95 B: yeah 

139.15 146.98 B: yeah i don't know i i guess i i'm not sure i i i just i know i don't like them and i i don't understand why they're so popular 

146.99 156.09 B: for me it's it it coming i'm an also a musician and and so i look at the arts and i think has it gotten that bad that nobody can think of anything creative 

155.50 160.10 A: yeah well and also i think they've also created the audience for it out there too 

160.54 163.96 A: you know it's like i think any other kind of a a habit or 

164.53 173.84 A: you know a a mainstream per se and then it just gets more popular and more popular and more popular until you're finally eating all of that kind of a menu and you've forgotten what 

166.33 167.74 B: mhm yeah 

174.01 178.07 A: you know m- more basic or home cooking or more wholesome foods are so 

177.51 191.04 B: that's what i was just thinking when you were saying that was yeah it's like junk food of t._v. and that it's so easy for people to just like you say it's it's mind candy and that they can turn it on not really get involved and it doesn't matter where it goes 

180.75 182.70 A: mhm mhm 

190.79 198.72 A: and unfortunately it's gotten to that point though because it's a ha- you know you're hard pressed to come up with an alternative even if you have cable solutions 

198.16 199.44 B: yeah 

198.84 204.17 A: you know even the premium channels because a lot of the uh the movies and such really are an art form 

204.37 207.20 A: i've noticed the a decline even in bravo [lipsmack] 

206.96 208.17 B: mhm 

207.67 219.32 A: uh you know where it used to be a lot more in terms of you know a lot more art type films and and foreign films and all and they're not doing that too much i'm surprised you know that [sigh] i've seen a shift in their whole zone or so 

211.91 212.82 B: sure 

219.08 220.97 B: huh that's that's a shame 

220.05 222.21 A: (( [lipsmack] mhm )) 

221.18 227.27 B: i i didn't know that uh i i don't follow bravo anymore i used to when twin peaks was on [laughter] 

226.88 229.38 A: (( oh was it on bravo really )) 

227.56 228.54 B: but uh 

229.10 230.01 B: uh-huh 

229.59 241.29 A: that might have been the turn then [laughter] [laughter] that's right [laughter] that there was the infection right yeah that was a bug descended on bravo [mn] 

231.43 237.34 B: [laughter] yes oh really there there was the demise david lynch once again [laughter] 

237.97 239.56 B: (( [laughter] )) 

240.71 247.25 B: oh yeah what a what a funny uh topic when they when they said reality shows i'm like uh-oh 

246.50 248.95 A: [laughter] what was your topic yesterday 

248.68 251.29 B: oh gosh what was it um 

251.30 253.92 B: you know to be honest with you i can't even think of it 

253.97 261.25 A: um i remember the to- 'cause i just signed up for this the night before last and i was so surprised that yesterday right away a call 

253.99 254.79 B: i was 

257.67 259.10 B: yeah same here 

260.88 261.81 B: mhm 

261.08 269.91 A: and right now right away a call and you know and i wonder if i've missed any but um i i guess i wasn't anticipating being called this frequently or this soon you know two and two 

269.64 278.21 B: yeah i just got back and there was a message that they had called and s- and i had the number so i called in and it's like okay you wanna talk we'll hook you up 

277.05 279.43 A: oh so it does leave a message then 

278.85 285.55 B: yeah yeah they do uh-huh it was funny too 'cause they go yeah today's topic is and it was something else you know and i'm like 

280.02 280.97 A: (( mm )) 

284.82 296.84 A: oh so i guess it's part of that whole random rotation [sigh] yesterday's topic for us was um as best i could hear it it was like what do you consider the w- the worst evil and um 

287.52 289.08 B: yeah mhm 

297.02 300.49 A: and i guess the general topic was personal habits 

300.12 304.09 B: that's yeah you're right and i yeah gossiping was my uh 

304.34 306.59 B: i i thought that was the worst because 

305.84 308.22 A: you thought that was the worst more so than alcohol 

308.01 317.29 B: well yeah because alcohol is self uh inflicted gossiping is something that usually hurts somebody else and i thought well you know that's 

317.52 321.02 B: that's not a very positive uh 

322.22 327.03 B: you know and i it's just not a good thing to do now i may may have misunderstood the topic 

327.28 341.74 B: but uh [mn] you know i i i drink a little alcohol i'm not uh abusive by no means yeah i you know i have a glass of wine or a beer occasionally i i'm at the age now where all that other stuff you know i just i got away from it and uh 

331.53 333.99 A: a teetotaler yeah [laughter] 

335.53 336.69 A: mhm 

340.86 342.01 A: yeah 

342.41 350.61 B: smoking same thing if you smoke you know you're you're hurting yourself you know secondhand smoke will kill us all but uh 

346.26 347.55 A: mhm 

350.30 361.28 A: right but when you said that's self inflicted with the alcoholism i thought of secondhand drinking you know sometimes the people i i mean fortunately we've been blessed that i don't have that in my family in terms of any um alcoholism but [lipsmack] 

354.51 355.44 B: yeah 

361.41 369.98 A: i've certainly see it affect other families and interestingly enough it wasn't one that popped to mind but i became more conscious of it because the gentleman that i was speaking with yesterday 

370.18 373.57 A: told me he had seventeen years of sobriety under his belt so 

372.97 373.95 B: wow 

373.67 376.14 A: yeah so um 

375.11 376.69 B: so it hit home uh 

376.42 384.36 A: so for him it really did right i was still kind of e- eliminating i was in the eliminating phase and then he just piped right up and said no that it was alcohol 

377.82 378.68 B: yeah 

384.10 385.05 B: wow 

384.51 386.76 A: so that kind of uh you know 

386.97 389.77 A: just kind of zeroed in for both of us when we started talking 

388.40 389.39 B: yeah 

389.75 393.04 B: so anyway you you're you're into t._v. what do you watch 

390.03 390.95 A: (( so what do you yeah )) 

392.66 406.34 A: well i wish i could be you know i mean i'm at a point in my life where i'm consist- uh constantly going i don't have a moment to take a breather i've got two young sons you know and uh i've got a quite a bit of a commute between home and where they go to school 

405.80 407.02 B: mhm 

406.40 417.34 A: my mom lives with us she's eighty and she has parkinson's so that's one of the reasons that i've decided to step away from corporate america and [lipsmack] freelance from home and just focus on the kids and and the mother for now 

412.55 414.05 B: (( oh right )) 

417.29 422.77 B: well that's that's that's very very nice of you i mean that it it it's a quite a 

419.92 421.09 A: so it 

421.62 425.04 A: it's my calling for now [laughter] 

423.31 427.76 B: yeah and it's quite a quite a load that you're that you've taken on mhm 

425.39 426.86 A: yeah 

427.06 431.37 A: yeah so um you know because of that i find myself just 

432.10 434.86 A: constantly on the go you know i'm sure some women 

435.28 441.58 A: and some people in general 'cause i've known men this way that are just you know awesome housekeepers and it's just systematic for them 

441.58 446.76 A: and that's not me so it takes [laughter] it takes up and i i wasn't born with that you know 

442.72 444.06 B: [laughter] 

446.56 457.77 A: domesticity dream or whatever that comes with these people but [mn] [lipsmack] so it's a little bit more challenging for me and there's nothing i like better than just you know dropping down with a book when i can or 

458.27 461.95 A: you know just phasing out for a little bit before i go to sleep 

461.31 462.50 B: mhm 

462.00 471.20 A: yeah it took me for years to uh to catch up on all the old reruns of of frasier that was my first my that was my comeback into the world was watching late night frasier 

467.26 468.35 B: (( [laughter] )) 

471.42 473.16 A: all the years that i'd missed 

472.80 473.93 B: mhm 

473.77 474.59 A: (( so um )) 

474.65 475.73 B: yeah i 

474.70 475.91 A: yeah but go 

475.94 476.79 A: ahead 

475.95 477.71 B: oh i'm sorry go ahead mhm 

477.03 484.83 A: no i was just going to say but you know now that i'm now that the boys are a little older and i can kind of cruise a little bit on the t._v. and surf round and see what's happening 

485.06 489.47 A: i again i find myself hard pressed i just go channel after channel after channel 

489.69 500.40 A: that i didn't find that i was even making time for t._v. except unfortunately you know for the last war coverage and all then i realized that oh yeah if there's something i really want to watch then i will make time for it 

500.85 501.81 A: um 

501.18 504.94 B: and that's that's your m- your masculine side coming out 

504.37 505.57 A: what's that 

505.17 506.59 B: channel surfing [laughter] 

506.23 515.48 A: yeah [laughter] but it's you know i mean there there's a bunch of i- it all seems segmented you know you can either watch uh 

515.39 527.51 A: like the w._b. classification where it's all that that e type stuff out there you know where you find all those home type shows in the upper c- cable channels or [mn] [lipsmack] you know but uh even network 

519.81 520.94 B: mhm 

524.06 524.89 B: right 

527.65 529.96 A: those used to be the the king 

530.31 535.16 A: and uh you can't even really distinguish them when you're clicking through 

534.84 541.89 B: right yeah it's it's uh the whole the whole thing even the the movies and the theatres have gotten so uh 

543.13 544.36 A: yeah 

543.20 546.76 B: nobody nobody writes anything creative anymore 

546.00 557.60 A: no no i remember they had uh i would say the equivalent of those was made for television movies back in the seventies you know where [sigh] where you would have something of epic proportions and they'd bring in an artist from 

552.93 553.94 B: mhm 

557.61 561.94 A: from yesteryear or something you know or and and make it a real feature 

562.23 568.54 A: [lipsmack] and then have uh whatever night at the movies and that was a big deal to be able to tune into something like that 

565.53 566.58 B: mhm 

568.56 576.38 B: yeah i'm a i'm a sixties child so i i grew up with kind of you know the old walt disney mickey mouse show and 

568.84 570.08 A: (( i'm sure i'm [lipsmack] )) 

575.79 576.79 A: oh 

576.58 580.08 B: god those those were just gold but i mean they're 

579.23 581.01 A: absolutely 

580.41 582.88 B: absolute classics you know and 

582.21 584.66 A: we still play i mean my kids we y- you know 

583.74 584.72 B: yeah 

584.76 597.49 A: you you just the other day you know 'cause we had moved last summer and i had uh that's one of the things that hadn't gotten unpacked is still stored up somewhere and i told them we need to break those videos out you know it it's been a while you know and i start naming off titles and 

597.33 599.89 A: they were getting excited too you know like yeah we need to find
