0.29 3.49 A: [mn] hi hello my name's carol 

0.37 1.76 B: hello 

3.19 4.87 B: hi carol i'm peggy 

4.72 6.64 A: oh i'm in st louis 

7.26 9.79 B: [lipsmack] [mn] i'm in ah hollywood california 

9.43 11.15 A: oh great 

10.50 11.79 B: how are you 

11.50 12.74 A: i'm fine 

12.47 15.62 B: good [mn] do you watch reality t._v. 

15.73 24.04 A: usually i don't i have occasionally watched um [mn] i think i watched some millionaire show once about 

23.23 24.48 B: [laughter] 

24.21 27.26 A: this guy who had to pick from three women 

27.21 28.41 B: mhm 

27.99 31.39 A: yeah but usually i don't watch it do you 

31.77 41.23 B: ah i stop on it because ah quite a bit because first of all i have a son and he's so involved with it it's so engrossing for them i'm not sure why 

40.90 42.48 A: how old is your son 

41.91 43.12 B: he's nine 

42.81 43.80 A: oh 

43.73 58.27 B: so he'll stop on it but um i find myself because ah it's sort of peer pressure almost that every body talks about these shows so much [mn] that i i f- i kind of want to tune in to see what the heck all the action and talk a- is about 

52.36 53.44 A: yeah 

57.54 58.67 A: yeah 

58.13 62.04 B: [mn] so if i do tune in i like to tune in late in the show 

61.76 62.64 A: (( ahah )) 

62.17 63.74 B: so i don't have to 

64.11 76.01 B: [mn] actually go through the elimination process the questioning process like on on millionaire or these bachelor shows or survivor i like sort of um 

72.21 73.41 A: yeah 

76.73 80.51 B: i- i i find it overly dramatic [lipsmack] 

80.13 81.71 A: yes yes 

80.88 85.45 B: i don't find it real at all [laughter] actually [laughter] 

83.05 86.20 A: yeah yeah i don't think it's real either 

85.71 95.73 B: i i i sort of you know what i what i think of in reality for reality shows is something like the old fashioned candid camera [mn] 

95.84 97.05 A: oh yeah 

96.56 107.08 B: to me that is more reality than what they're depicting these people who know they're being filmed so they're going to dramatize every single time they pick up their fork to me you know what i mean 

106.62 115.80 A: right and then after they do those shows then they end up on oprah talking all about it have you ever seen that happen 

115.31 116.52 B: (( [cough] yes )) 

116.35 122.21 A: oh it's so ridiculous and so then they get more publicity [mn] for um 

121.25 122.49 B: more money 

122.23 133.65 A: yeah going through it but actually the more i think about it i probably have watched i think i checked out survivor because my d- my daughter is thirty five 

130.32 131.17 B: yes 

133.56 140.10 A: and she has an eleven year old son and she watches survivor she she loves it 

135.61 136.75 B: mhm 

138.49 141.01 B: she wouldn't miss it ah ahah 

141.03 146.11 A: and so i checked it out because i thought well my daughter and i are quite a bit alike 

145.84 146.84 B: mhm 

146.20 155.15 A: and i thought well maybe i'll love it too well forget it i didn't love it at all [laughter] i just didn't want to you know i just thought it was stupid 

151.79 152.43 B: (( [laughter] )) 

154.81 164.07 B: [mn] well it it seems a little stupid and it and to me it's very unrealistic [mn] you never see you rarely see anybody kicking back enjoying life 

163.93 165.08 A: right 

164.53 169.14 B: [mn] so it becomes to me um about all about the money 

168.88 170.46 A: exactly because 

169.66 174.32 B: all about the end and i don't really love that in our society 

173.98 175.04 A: right 

174.46 178.59 B: or or to to or to advocate it for for the next generation 

178.34 179.77 A: exactly 

178.43 190.81 B: yes we're capitalists we're all capitalists but [mn] i mean to not see these people like in the survivor case where it's so beautiful there's such a gorgeous setting they may never be there again in their lives 

190.37 191.55 A: yeah 

190.95 202.86 B: and they're battling and dueling and and being nasty to each other for the end of of course winning which is a i mean they i think they choose these contestants because they're fiercely competitive 

202.20 203.83 A: right 

202.86 207.63 B: and in tiptop shape i appreciate all that [mn] but to not enjoy it and to not [lipsmack] 

207.72 214.24 B: have the audience see us enjoy see them enjoy it somewhat i think takes away from the reality 

211.24 212.20 A: yeah 

214.87 216.63 B: ah to me it's not real 

216.32 218.99 A: yeah right right 

216.68 218.01 B: (( because of that i- )) 

218.21 228.48 B: if i were there i'd say well go ahead go ahead you go down the path and i'll [mn] but you know but they may be fired for that i don't know but to see ah more enjoyment i think would be more real 

228.14 232.36 A: yeah [mn] one time when i watched i think it was the millionaire show and 

232.46 241.43 A: a couple of those girls who went on it you know they always have beautiful clothes the families are always perfect and rich 

241.55 242.58 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

241.65 246.20 A: you know and they live in a perfect place of course too 

245.82 247.11 B: mhm 

246.52 254.51 A: and you kind of wonder do they really live there or are they just you know making this like a set for them to see 

253.52 257.33 B: or they or they cast those perfect people 

257.19 258.49 A: oh yeah 

257.77 259.79 B: which is not real either to me 

259.52 261.07 A: right right 

260.42 273.62 B: [noise] you know they could be casting they could be looking for that sort of um [lipsmack] perfect person you know because it is t._v. but [mn] i think it's i think it's wrong to call all of that stuff reality t._v. [noise] 

265.68 266.68 A: yeah 

267.99 268.90 A: yeah 

273.03 274.84 A: yeah i do too 

275.11 278.55 B: because it's based in reality it's based on 

279.52 281.09 B: a lot of fantasy 

280.92 282.79 A: yeah definitely 

281.72 287.42 B: [laughter] so you know there's supposed to be a new channel they've been advertising out here 

287.73 294.92 B: there's a new channel coming that's just gonna be reality it's coming from the makers i think of e. channel 

292.00 293.51 A: oh really 

294.97 296.05 A: oh 

295.20 298.46 B: which is a hot a h- hot channel if you want to catch up on 

298.65 300.76 B: you know trivia news [lipsmack] 

299.98 300.97 A: right 

302.17 316.54 B: but i guess they're gonna do a a one entire channel [lipsmack] maybe this ah [mn] conversation has something to do with it that they're doing surveys or something yeah one channel that you can just watch [mn] reality t._v. twenty four seven 

316.40 317.33 A: oh 

317.01 319.35 B: how exciting [laughter] 

318.50 325.45 A: yeah really i thought this conversation was just for language to study language patterns 

324.85 326.03 B: oh 

325.84 328.55 A: and what kinds of 

328.56 331.29 A: um expressions we use 

330.77 332.04 B: (( mm )) 

331.92 338.60 A: because i saw it in e._s._l. magazine which is english as a second language magazine

350.28 352.85 A: yeah i don't know but who knows 

352.05 353.76 B: (( you could be right ))
