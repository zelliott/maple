8.46 10.27 B: so reality television 

10.44 11.88 A: (( [laughter] yeah [noise] )) 

11.79 23.39 B: um i'm an i'm an addict uh sorry to say [laughter] of a- american idol this season i started watching it and i don't think it's the best it's not the best show on t._v. but i'm i'm definitely an addict [laughter] 

23.92 25.25 A: i love survivor 

25.67 30.57 A: i've been following survivor since the first one i didn't watch it but i sorta got into it 

31.01 35.75 A: [noise] i don't particularly watch american idol i'm very busy i work i work nights sometimes so 

35.55 36.86 B: (( yeah i'm )) 

36.24 37.14 A: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

37.48 38.61 B: um 

38.73 42.58 B: [cough] i'm a singer myself ah so i 

42.45 49.44 B: tend to be real critical [laughter] when i hear other singers and it's not like the best it's not the best singing that i've heard and i've heard a lot of people 

49.30 58.16 B: uh sing better than the people on the show [laughter] but it's just like once i i i started to watch it i didn't watch the one last season i think i watched like one episode of it 

51.87 52.70 A: (( [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

57.97 72.45 B: and i think they kicked off someone that i really liked and it was like i was like oh this is dumb so [laughter] uh this season i started watching it i'm just i'm totally hooked [laughter] uh and last night the the person i think everybody thought was going to get kicked off didn't get kicked off so 

72.35 73.47 B: uh 

73.49 88.26 B: i i i even didn't i didn't watch most of the show last night i we didn't have it on i turned on the t._v. and somebody else was singing and when they are usually singing at the end it usually means that they're going to kick off one of those people so they kind of give them like their last chance and uh 

88.32 99.57 B: uh that happened and uh when i saw the one guy singing i said oh they didn't kick him off and they ended up not kicking him off but this other girl that also oh uh i didn't think was going to get kicked off so it's interesting 

90.29 91.22 A: (( [mn] )) 

101.16 102.71 A: i don't um 

103.09 108.42 A: the only one i really like is survivor although that one that new one with monica lewinsky is really bad
