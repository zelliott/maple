0.02 1.18 A: dawn 

0.90 2.06 B: hello 

1.95 2.83 A: hello 

2.45 4.21 B: uh my my name is barry 

4.27 5.44 A: (( hi barry )) 

5.43 8.42 B: uh what do you think about reality t._v. 

8.26 18.71 A: well you know what we always say that we're not going to watch it my husband and i but we always wind up watching it [laughter] it's l- uh it's i've felt like it's probably 'cause um 

19.44 25.65 A: you you always wanna see what what people will do when they're just you know in their own element 

26.17 38.27 B: well it gets people to do things they wouldn't normally do for money and for uh popularity like some of the people obviously are hoping uh after they were off the show to turn it into some kind of career 

37.08 40.43 A: yeah yeah exactly well just like on um 

40.47 41.38 A: uh 

41.90 56.64 A: we watch uh american idol um and there's a lot of the the people that were in last year's american idol that you know didn't make it and are currently doing sitcoms now and uh 

57.04 64.08 A: and stuff li- and and have albums that are fixing to come out you know so i mean they can do a lot with with their popularity 

64.13 65.83 A: afterwards 

64.17 66.96 B: well it it it kind of 

67.04 71.68 B: the bottom line can be of these shows is that people will do anything for money 

71.49 73.98 A: yeah that's true and 

72.98 78.79 B: and uh it doesn't matter you know how degrading it is or uh whatever uh 

78.94 83.05 B: i'm not sure it sends a good message to to uh younger people 

83.07 86.90 A: well it doesn't send a good message to younger people but um 

87.13 99.42 A: if you're doing it for the right reasons and you're not going to uh jeopardize your um your beliefs and your personality then uh then it it's a good idea 

98.11 111.78 B: well i think pe- pe- people i i think go on the show i'm i'm not saying everybody but at least some people go on the show with certain beliefs that they're not going to go beyond a certain point and then they get into the show 

109.03 110.22 A: mhm 

111.53 112.61 A: and they do 

111.77 120.73 B: and and they're they get pu- shoved or pushed or peer pressure or uh they start thinking you know maybe i can win all this 

120.75 125.16 B: and uh their beliefs certainly are put to the test 

124.64 125.49 A: mhm 

126.20 131.16 A: yeah uh a- and but i- if you are a true person of of god then 

126.22 127.09 B: and 

131.03 145.09 A: then uh you would stand tall and stand true to your beliefs now if you're someone that just likes to put on a front and to uh to say that you know that you're a good person then you're not going to hold true to your beliefs and it's going to come out 

144.87 148.08 B: well i i think that happens a lot on those shows 

144.97 146.68 A: because if you're true 

147.53 151.68 A: oh yeah it will your true nature always comes out no matter what 

150.92 160.11 B: because part of it is back biting you know uh you you're going to be voted off and you're trying to be friends with everybody so you're not the person voted off the show 

160.21 161.59 B: and uh 

161.74 171.72 B: all of a sudden uh y- you know as i said uh you you're conspiring to get rid of other people that you may even like in to some degree or pretend to like 

169.69 170.73 A: yeah 

171.92 181.92 A: that's true that's true well and you know a lot of two facing going on and it's one thing that i've really i've really you know like survivor i watch survivor 

182.00 192.34 A: and i don't know why i just do it's some it just intrigues me for some reason i guess it's mainly to see how many you know nasty people we really do have in this world you know 

193.18 206.64 A: and uh you know like the rob character that's on there he just he befriended a lot of people and then turns around and just you know totally smacks them on uh in the face and says yeah well you shouldn't have trusted me 

206.61 211.60 A: and you know that that shouldn't be the way the the world is you should be able to trust people 

211.87 213.06 A: (( and um )) 

213.28 221.71 A: but of course why would you go on a reality show that uh is basically about not trusting if you were trustworthy you know [laughter] 

221.91 226.70 B: well it reminds me something like jerry springer that these people go on the show 

226.71 238.63 B: and uh if everything is okay in your life at all uh and you're invited on the show by your girlfriend or boyfriend or whatever you know something's coming i mean you have to be just an absolute dumbbell to 

235.63 236.62 A: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

238.40 243.78 B: not know they're going to say they're sleeping with your mother or your brother or your sister or god knows what 

243.26 244.05 A: yeah 

243.85 251.67 B: and uh uh you know you're being set up and yet these people seem to have these expressions like oh i don't believe this 

247.77 248.89 A: still go on 

251.14 251.97 A: yep 

252.51 254.48 B: like it's coming from nowhere 

253.95 255.14 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

254.50 258.37 B: uh these shows are are from the networks' point of view 

258.53 261.36 B: (( are are very popular because )) 

261.37 271.20 B: they can put them on at relatively very low cost they don't have to be paying like the friends people hundreds of thousands of dollars each each one of them for for one 

271.15 285.03 B: uh episode uh the people come on even if they win fifty thousand dollars it's peanuts compared to what they would pay actual actual actors and actresses or people to write uh screenplays or uh comedy shows 

283.26 284.39 A: (( exactly mhm mhm )) 

284.88 292.23 B: and from their point of view it's very popular at a very relatively very low cost i i still think this is going to at some point 

292.21 306.37 B: uh remember the show the you know the millionaire type shows that were on where people would answer questions and they they started off just a little bit and then it was on like three or four or five times a week i i think these shows eventually are going to peter out 

295.81 296.58 A: (( yeah )) 

297.34 298.06 A: yeah 

302.86 303.78 A: mhm 

306.71 307.89 A: yeah i and 

306.85 308.16 B: but i could be wrong 

308.16 313.39 A: well i i believe they will too for the simple fact that um 

313.82 323.05 A: you you're gonna you're gonna r- reach y- right now you're reaching the people that are willing to to degrade themselves and uh and 

322.41 325.51 B: well that's a lot of people for money [laughter] 

324.04 325.09 A: yeah 

325.03 332.95 A: and but then you're gonna then you're gonna get those people that are just you know they're they're not gonna be willing to do that they're not going to 

332.85 344.62 A: uh put themselves on the level just for entertainment and that's exactly what it is they get millions and millions of dollars just in just in showing the show for entertainment and 

344.81 352.74 A: what is it just to give away one million dollars when you're getting five six seven million dollars in the ratings and um 

352.18 353.85 B: (( a lot more than that )) 

353.30 355.74 A: yeah and so you know 

356.41 369.32 A: one of these days people are gonna say well you know kinda tired it's the same thing over and over again you know why do i continue to watch this and w- just like with the with the uh a uh 

369.54 382.86 A: sitcom series it doesn't last that long there's there there comes a time when it's run its course and it's time to say goodbye to it and it will run its course it's just a matter of time working its way out 

383.64 384.22 A: (( [cough] )) 

385.41 398.78 B: well i i'm not a fan of it i have to say uh i don't denigrate anybody that wants to watch it you know everybody has what they like to watch uh i'm not a particular fan of it uh but uh that's just me 

393.20 394.03 A: mhm 

398.21 400.40 A: yeah well [mn] 

398.92 399.80 B: and 

399.98 407.32 B: maybe if i was younger and i had a great beautiful body and everything and all this money was waved ac- you know in front of me 

401.41 402.05 A: (( [laughter] )) 

407.19 415.00 B: and this was my one moment or ch- chance to get fame or get noticed uh maybe my uh attitude would be a lot different 

415.26 419.96 A: well not only that i mean there's the like a a 

421.15 421.94 A: (( um )) 

421.98 423.81 A: the bachelor show 

425.71 429.03 A: i don't understand how you can sit there 

429.13 430.25 A: and 

431.72 432.62 A: (( go thr- )) 

432.80 434.55 A: you know do that kind of stuff 

434.26 438.30 B: well you're making out with uh thirty or forty different women 

437.94 438.78 A: (( yeah )) 

438.41 440.86 B: and uh they're all 

439.44 441.52 A: making out with their partners and 

440.93 447.23 B: [laughter] and they're all sitting around thinking it's wonderful and i just wish he'd make out with me 

441.95 443.39 A: and their partners' partners 

444.34 446.40 A: yeah and it it's disgusting 

446.76 454.84 A: yeah it's it's very disgusting and i don't and then and then you're going to sit there and say well this is the person i want to marry you've only known 'em for a month 

452.68 461.59 B: yeah and and at the end of the show you've known this this person for all of a week or whatever they've known 'em and boy that that that's a great uh 

457.53 458.44 A: yeah 

461.68 464.91 B: uh basis to start a marriage 

464.30 470.12 A: exactly and especially when you just got finished uh smooching all over some other girl [laughter] 

470.78 473.09 A: so you really haven't even known 'em for that long 

472.84 479.11 B: a- and the you know the engagement rings start flying and and two or three weeks later you find out they broke up 

478.54 480.21 A: yeah exactly 

480.41 481.36 A: (( uh it's )) 

480.43 487.59 B: and uh i i just don't see it but as i said maybe i'm just an old fuddy duddy [laughter] ah 

485.22 493.53 A: just [laughter] no because i mean i wouldn't do anything like that either you know people pe- uh m- marriage is is a 

493.52 500.42 A: sacred bond and it should be kept that way you should not go into it lightly 

500.60 501.72 A: (( and um )) 

502.46 507.77 A: so you have people go on a show like that and say okay i'll i'll marry whoever 

507.84 511.08 A: ah you know turns me on the best 

511.23 522.10 A: it's pretty degrading to the people around uh that have been married and put a lot of work into their marriage and believe it to be a bond between two people 

522.04 522.94 B: well 

522.43 526.71 A: and then you see this this man or this woman going around um 

526.47 538.97 B: this this reminds me to to some degree as i said of jerry springer show it may be a little bit elevated i mean at least the people going on are are not completely crazy or nuts like they would be on springer 

530.21 530.93 A: (( yeah )) 

538.92 544.41 B: but to me it's the same idea going on that people will do anything 

544.12 544.88 A: (( yes )) 

545.20 548.30 B: ah for their fame or whatever and uh 

548.47 551.21 B: ah i just think it just you know uh 

551.41 557.03 B: goes to the lowest common denominator but apparently especially among young people it's a very popular 

557.07 563.44 B: and uh i don't i don't blame the the uh networks for putting it on as i said to them it's a 

563.32 564.33 A: it's ratings 

563.47 571.61 B: i- very inexpensive to put on extremely popular they don't have to uh write a lot about it and uh 

565.72 566.43 A: mhm 

571.74 583.11 B: uh it's very cost effective and they're they're looking for some way to compete uh with uh h._b._o. and showtime and uh other uh 

580.76 581.83 A: exactly 

583.18 591.50 B: uh networks like that and uh trying to uh come up with something that's going to get the attention of young people and uh 

591.46 599.89 B: you know uh i'm sure that they would love to put nudity on if they could get away with it and bad language and uh every everything down the line 

597.68 599.89 A: well the and wh- and when they do that
