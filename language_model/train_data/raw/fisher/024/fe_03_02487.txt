1.06 2.58 A: my name's julie 

2.66 5.50 B: hi julie my name is bill how are you today 

5.40 7.43 A: i'm doing good how are you [laughter] 

7.05 11.90 B: good so so what's your take on the reality programs 

11.46 15.50 A: um for the most part i pretty much enjoy 'em [laughter] 

14.77 16.76 B: do you really 

15.96 22.71 A: yeah well most of 'em there's some that are pretty bad but i'm pretty uh addicted to like american idol and big brother 

22.88 26.96 A: and uh shows like that i don't watch 'em all just a few of 'em [laughter] 

26.72 29.93 B: huh i can't handle it 

29.43 31.55 A: oh really [laughter] 

30.72 32.27 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

31.71 42.55 A: [laughter] i mean i think they all have gotten a little bit out of hand with too many of 'em but the ones that first started it you know within the l- like they've gone on four or five years are the ones i pretty much stick to [laughter] 

42.99 54.82 B: huh yeah i i tried to watch the survivor and it looks pretty okay and it seems that could be exciting but it seems so so strange to me i mean 

55.22 62.10 B: to be to be taken out to an island or somewhere and having to do some of the stuff that they have to do 

62.18 71.00 A: yeah survivor's one of the ones i don't watch i don't like that one i could never get into that one uh i always thought it was kind of ridiculous and stupid 

70.90 73.00 B: huh yeah 

71.52 78.86 A: but uh but i do for some reason i did like big brother i don't know if you know which one that one is where they stick 'em in the house [laughter] 

78.49 89.53 B: oh yeah yeah well that's even weirder road rules was the one i sorta used to watch a little bit of before that was pretty cool where they had those challenges to do 

87.09 88.54 A: yeah i've watched that one 

89.43 90.82 A: mhm 

90.58 102.26 B: but um the the i don't know if it's a reality show but the one i think it's on n._b._c. the one where they they have to do perform these acts like ride a bicycle across a 

102.36 106.48 B: a a be- a beam between two buildings 

106.52 107.87 A: fear factor 

106.87 112.32 B: and yeah fear factor yeah [laughter] now that 

108.56 112.84 A: [laughter] yeah i watch that one too [laughter] 

112.15 127.09 B: well that one i sort of slip in and out of uh i can't handle the bug eating thing but i don't know i mean if i had to eat bugs i think i could eat bugs but watching somebody sit there and put their head in a in a vat of bugs seems very peculiar to me 

126.97 131.62 A: well usually whenever they gotta eat something that's when i kinda turn my head i usually don't like that part 

131.32 133.82 B: [laughter] [laughter] well ho- 

132.26 136.08 A: [laughter] i can handle the extreme stunts but [laughter] 

136.21 144.59 B: what what about the one where you put the head your head in with the worms or something that they have i don't know if you've ever seen 

142.89 145.79 A: i don't think i could do that [laughter] 

145.87 148.07 B: yeah it's so- 

146.96 149.18 A: when it comes to the bug part nah 

149.83 157.83 B: the survivor i sort of admire those people i kinda like those d- [mn] i i it's not really a reality show 

157.89 169.36 B: um but it's the one where they do that two hundred mile challenge where they have teams of people that like go down to chile or south america or something and they 

167.75 170.26 A: [laughter] oh the eco challenge 

169.65 171.82 B: eco challenge yeah 

170.70 174.12 A: yeah they got the new one getting ready to come on for fiji [laughter]

188.37 192.26 A: uh i like to veg out in front of the t._v. when i get off a work [laughter] 

192.06 193.16 B: uh-huh 

193.35 201.19 B: yeah am- american idol looks pretty good i've only seen clips of it 'cause i i'm uh hooked on a couple of other shows when those are on 

201.56 205.97 B: but that they're they're i i saw this kid that did um 

206.03 209.28 B: elvis the other night did you see him 

207.57 208.50 A: uh-huh 

209.50 213.76 A: nah i don't think i saw the elvis one was that one on

214.62 229.20 B: eight or nine years old and he w- he he was dressed up like elvis not in a shiny suit but i think he had a leather jacket on with the collar turned up and he was singing a couple of elvi- he sang a elvis song 

223.45 226.44 A: mhm 

229.40 232.64 A: that one i think that one's uh the american kid one 

229.82 230.82 B: yeah 

232.83 238.93 A: 'cause they have two they have one that's like america's most talented kid and then they have american idol which is the adults

239.15 240.41 B: ah 

239.30 244.92 A: like the teenagers and adults and then the other one is kids so that one sounds like that was the kid one

247.95 249.61 B: go ahead 

248.81 257.96 A: i was going to say the one ah show that i am not interested in at all is the one that's hosted by monica lewinsky the mr personality that one looks really stupid [laughter] 

258.05 264.57 B: [lipsmack] oh hey yeah that's really strange where they have the mask oh serious man 

263.43 265.63 A: yeah 

265.00 266.35 B: (( oh )) 

266.41 270.58 A: it looks like some sort of demented wrestling thing going on [laughter] 

266.78 267.74 B: did 

270.51 274.83 B: what kind of woman would want to you know act that way 

275.09 284.40 A: no i i couldn't do that i'd need to see 'em i mean looks don't aren't everything but i gotta see the person so you know i couldn't just go through three months you know trying to date somebody without even seeing 'em 

284.51 286.70 B: is that how long it is three months 

286.69 290.14 A: i think so i think they last twelve weeks is what they do 

290.38 297.86 A: it's either six or twelve weeks i'm not sure exactly but it's such a short period of time and they're trying to say you're going learn their personality that quickly 

290.73 291.82 B: yeah 

297.94 302.34 A: i i just can't see that happening how people can get married off a these shows [laughter] 

302.52 307.97 B: oh hey yeah that did that woman get married the one that was on channel on fox 

308.38 312.23 B: that that uh ma- married in america or something 

308.60 309.95 A: i don't know

314.74 316.33 B: (( yeah i saw th- )) 

315.21 317.70 A: so i don't know i don't know what happened with that one 

317.42 322.47 B: i saw the headline for that and i couldn't believe it i go god wouldn't i- would [mn] 

322.75 326.22 B: wouldn't it be more fun to choose and make your own mistakes 

326.26 328.47 A: yeah [laughter] and 

327.19 331.73 B: i don't know you know married by america let somebody else choose your 

331.81 335.32 B: the person that's there for you huh hm 

335.38 336.69 A: that just doesn't 

335.46 336.61 B: (( yeah i'm )) 

336.89 345.40 B: i d- i'm not much of a reality program show i tho- i think i'll get into it but right now not really 

344.71 351.97 A: i i think one of the biggest reasons why i watch 'em is because it's all that's on there's so many of them they that they monopolize 

351.90 353.55 A: the the time 

353.44 366.65 A: and that you can't get any more regular sitcoms going 'cause i really would rather prefer watching sitcoms like friends i'm really into watching friends but they just don't bring any new ones out any more they just keep bringing more reality 

366.65 370.28 A: and you that's why i get so into 'em because that's all that's on [laughter] 

370.43 375.12 B: yeah that's what that's what they say they interviewed a fellow yesterday 

375.32 389.23 B: and and he he was a contestant on one of the shows one of the reality shows and he said that's the whole new market but i got this cable package and i get a whole bunch of other channels like i get um 

389.81 391.23 B: um 

391.41 397.64 B: i i get i get these movies i get about five or six it's called stars i get these

405.92 406.97 A: yeah 

409.17 412.04 A: yeah we get i have the stars package too but 

412.25 416.86 A: uh most of the good movies they come on i've seen 'em a hundred times [laughter] 

416.56 422.67 B: yeah yeah i like the one i've been hooked on lately is the one with uh robert redford in spy 

423.12 427.31 B: it's it [mn] the spy program where he he uh 

423.41 424.34 A: what 

427.61 431.83 B: he and somebody else are uh he he's the um 

431.85 439.79 B: sort of the uh man that manipulates this uh spy and he has him doing all kind of different things it's a real 

438.41 440.15 A: [lipsmack] i don't think i've seen that one 

440.05 445.26 B: yeah it's really good it's it's one of his red- redford's latest ones 

445.52 459.26 B: and and it's done he's sort of in in in his last days a- at the c._i._a. or the d- d._o._d. department of defense or something and this this guy he used to work with a few years back um 

454.87 455.83 A: mhm 

459.77 467.00 B: w- or tried to uh rescue his this woman he fell in love with and um she's in prison 

464.52 465.36 A: mhm 

467.40 472.09 B: so it i i get that and then i get these other channels like um 

467.55 468.59 A: oh goodness 

472.14 475.78 B: i get bob newhart and i got um 

475.86 481.20 B: the um those these other channels where you get some e._s._p._n. two 

481.07 483.65 A: yeah we have that 

481.29 482.64 B: and 

482.65 496.51 B: and and you get some of these history channels and couple of other channels there's a really great science channel just a really great so when some of this other stuff is on i just peruse through those or cruise those channels 

496.04 504.48 A: yeah i- um usually when football season comes around i'm usually watching football so then uh all the reality kind of goes out the door [laughter] 

504.54 514.44 B: [laughter] so what what do you think of this arena football [laughter] that's not our topic [laughter] well that's kind of a reality show isn't it 

509.92 511.82 A: i know [laughter] 

514.36 515.67 A: i guess so 

514.47 518.80 B: it's an old real- that's an old reality show but now i 

517.62 518.97 A: i i've never 

519.22 526.45 A: i've never watched the arena football but uh except a few times so i i don't have a real big take on it yet [laughter] 

525.82 526.94 B: huh 

526.67 535.56 A: i know we're supposed to be getting an arena team down here in new orleans uh within the next year so maybe i'll get a little more into it once we get a team [laughter] 

536.05 539.53 B: yeah it's a much smaller field and it's played inside the stadium 

540.16 541.90 A: yeah 

540.84 549.82 B: i i do like i- i liked that um survivor program for the different places where they've been at the the different 

548.51 550.60 A: yeah that would be interesting to do 

550.72 558.33 B: and and and and it seems so strange it's like there's these people out there that hold back reality and then they 

550.76 552.74 A: [laughter] if you could go someplace 

558.13 570.26 B: feed these people who win and there's this whole shaping of i used to i studied some psychology and they they try and shape people's behaviour and and stuff um 

569.50 570.72 A: mhm 

571.09 573.32 B: you know it's it's um 

573.42 581.67 B: [lipsmack] it's kind of cool the settings and stuff but some of the the backstabbing and all that other stuff that goes on it's a little bizarre for me 

580.58 592.73 A: yeah all just for money and they tell you do all these things and the worst part is they're doing it in front of millions of people they're showing them their bad side and then that's what people remember 'em for is the backstabbing you know person 

592.79 595.73 A: that screwed some other person just so they could get money 

595.77 599.89 A: and i wouldn't want to be known to be that person for the rest of my life walking down the street say hey
