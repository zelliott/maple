461.42 463.92 B: oh but that's part of their personality though 

463.55 472.52 A: well i guess it would it would lead her into thinking well if he's rich or he does this and that makes him rich so that really wouldn't make it his personality 

464.11 465.37 B: in their jobs 

469.46 470.96 B: oh i see 

471.46 477.70 B: yeah but like what if one's a poet or a painter or something that would be a big part of his character

528.40 536.27 B: [laughter] oh my gosh that's ridiculous [laughter] i guess it's kind of better than having someone choose who you're going to marry
