59.08 60.79 B: whatever the first one was

105.61 106.91 A: oh really 

106.18 112.70 B: yeah i couldn't stand her so i was like you know and then a couple of other people so i i watched one i think and then i thought hm 

112.87 116.89 B: but these other ones with this you know married by america and 

116.68 118.20 A: i haven't seen that 

117.83 122.39 B: yeah that that was i mean i watched a little bit of it 'cause it was so stupid i had to watch it [mn] 

122.43 132.44 A: sure i had to check out the joe millionaire because i had seen commercials or something on a i don't know what about it and thought i had to check it out ah just just 

123.08 124.04 B: yeah 

129.24 130.20 B: yeah 

131.24 134.36 B: oh they got they got a lot of press they did for that show 

133.92 138.59 A: that's probably why but i didn't care for that i didn't like the people per se 

134.81 135.87 B: because that was 

137.72 141.88 B: yeah yeah and then it kinda and it was just you know gold diggers versus 

141.92 147.93 B: silly guy and then you know the ending was the ending was so i mean i had to watch the ending 'cause of 

143.25 145.00 A: exactly [laughter] 

147.25 149.12 A: i didn't see the ending 'cause 

148.45 157.86 B: it was so nobody cared when he said he wasn't a millionaire no one gave two hoots they were just trying to get on t._v. so they could you know 

151.07 152.05 A: right 

155.09 156.19 A: right 

157.70 158.79 A: right 

158.43 160.42 B: go and play boy or 

160.25 161.34 A: oh yuck 

160.55 165.79 B: be a cheerleader or something like that that's what they were [laughter] that's what the girls were doing [noise] 

163.70 164.87 A: oh yuck 

165.32 171.15 A: well and then from of the episodes of the bachelor that i saw i thought the women on joe millionaire were not 

171.46 179.11 A: the same kind of women [noise] 'cause like the w- t- the little bit of the bachelor i saw the ones that i had seen were professional women 

179.03 180.00 B: yeah 

179.37 183.38 A: you know one was a marketing person one was this that or the other thing yeah 

183.68 194.60 B: well that's the difference between a._b._c. and fox i think [laughter] i think it's got to do yeah a._b._c. is pretty good and fox is trash i mean if you any of the trashy reality will be on fox 

185.97 187.71 A: okay [laughter] 

194.58 198.00 A: oh well that's probably why i don't see too much of that [sigh] 

194.87 196.92 B: i think i mean like that 

197.27 201.76 B: yeah that's why married married by america was on fox and uh 

201.59 205.10 A: now what was that was that where they actually like pick the 

205.35 217.28 B: well the they they had a girl that was married getting married and they had to pick guys and america voted down the guys and then they finally got to like three guys and actually she didn't meet him until after the ring was on the finger 

205.44 207.21 A: person to get married 

217.79 220.40 A: no see that's just wrong [laughter] 

217.88 218.78 B: (( it was )) 

219.13 219.97 B: yeah 

220.06 222.90 B: that's what's wrong with the marriage world nowadays you know 

222.79 227.24 A: right i would not even care to watch something like that i wouldn't even check it out 

225.70 226.56 B: yeah 

227.27 233.21 B: yeah well i checked it 'cause it was so stupid maybe there was nothing else on i don't know but i mean i thought this is this is stupid i [noise] 

233.19 244.86 A: you know it is really silly because if you happen to be -e changing channels and you come across something like that you stop for a minute you know and you go what's this and i think the draw 

240.76 241.81 B: (( yeah mm )) 

242.02 245.21 B: yeah people people like reality 

245.28 251.81 A: right it's i think the draw is if these are r- regular people and it's unscripted 

251.85 254.48 A: you know who knows um 

255.32 261.23 A: you know maybe it's more real reality but i think after you watch it for a while you realize okay 

261.42 266.49 A: um okay maybe it's not scripted i don't know that these are exactly regular people 

266.61 272.81 A: and 'cause would a regular person really go on there like you were saying the kind of women you thought why they went on joe millionaire 

272.40 273.69 B: yeah yeah [noise] 

273.07 275.97 A: and [noise] you know the 

276.03 280.54 A: they probably film a whole lot [noise] but then they choose what they put on the show 

280.19 285.45 B: oh yeah it's edited i mean you know one hour could be a week like survivor you know survivor's like 

285.96 290.58 B: a couple of days and then they throw a you know who knows what happened and they'll make you look 

290.82 292.93 B: however they want you to look 

292.65 293.94 A: right 

293.37 298.89 B: you know and that's t._v. though i mean you but you know you better be ready for that if you're giving yourself to the television [noise] 

298.74 308.58 A: right i saw the bachelor aaron talk about one kiss that had been televised and he said they made that scene because they filmed it from three different camera angles 

308.17 309.19 B: mhm 

308.51 315.08 A: they made it seem three times as long and three times as much and three times as whatever as what it really was 

314.81 316.20 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

315.90 320.19 A: and i do get start getting uncomfortable with those shows when they start kissing and stuff 

319.75 322.90 B: yeah but that's that that's ratings 

320.69 321.41 A: (( c- )) 

322.31 331.97 A: 'cause it goes from him or her if it's the bachelorette or whatever i didn't see too much of that but they go from kissing one person onto a date with another person that they're kissing and you're just going okay 

332.13 334.54 B: yeah yeah 

332.20 335.09 A: what what's happening here so i think 

335.36 339.84 B: but you gotta be a special kind of person to want to go on a show like that i think i mean i [laughter] i mean 

338.53 343.33 A: [mn] yeah i don't think you're a regular person i don't think the average joe on the street would go 

340.05 341.42 B: (( yeah i don't think i mean )) 

342.97 349.40 B: yeah i mean you you know and then these ones that you know they they've met the guy or what the girl or whatever it was i watched something and they're 

349.55 358.63 B: all bummed out 'cause after like one day they were in love with this person and then they got kicked off and it was like oh my god and they're crying and stuff like this and i was like wow 

353.35 354.39 A: [laughter] 

356.52 357.44 A: [laughter] 

358.91 361.21 B: you know you guys gotta go get a life 

361.20 362.05 A: yes 

362.30 366.19 B: but you know i mean people like that real life thing there's something about 

366.30 369.22 B: [noise] something about you know they think they 

369.59 376.74 B: there's something happening new or or fresh or you know i don't know it's that dream i suppose being rich too 

376.93 379.03 B: because there's always money involved 

378.68 383.33 A: so really in a way they're not reality shows they're fantasy sh- fantasy shows 

383.44 385.99 B: yeah yeah i mean that's 

386.06 389.60 B: y- you know but to people i mean they're stepping out of 

389.69 396.44 B: stepping out of their life and putting themselves in that position and they kinda dream you know like you say you know it's like a 

391.64 392.51 A: right 

396.90 398.87 B: reality but uh 

399.12 402.27 B: but not real you know i mean it's reality but not real 

402.20 409.31 A: right like if you go to a chateau and you're supposed to be vying for the affections of this millionaire guy 

402.68 403.52 B: 'cause it 

408.93 410.39 B: yeah yeah 

409.56 422.52 A: you know is that really real i guess you do see their real assuming the people are genuine you see their real responses to things like you were saying all the tears when you got cut from the show that you were in love with him 

411.77 412.63 B: and it 

418.63 419.71 B: well you 

419.92 420.84 B: yeah 

422.20 429.05 B: yeah i know that thing and that was well that's ratings i mean she's crying and stuff i mean the ratings people love that stuff it's like here's a woman that's lost it 

429.23 442.12 B: you know but the you know i think you have to be kind of i mean i don't know what kind of person you have to be to you know i don't know where the ad in the newspaper is where it says you know call up if you're a good looking girl to go and 

442.25 449.40 B: go and date somebody in france you know i don't know where these people are looking or where they're getting found 

445.15 446.20 A: right 

448.48 449.57 A: that's true 

449.67 451.06 B: so i think it's but 

450.18 458.79 A: that's true i don't know either i think once a show is there like survivor people would probably figure out oh i really want to go on survivor i can figure out how to [mn] [laughter] 

458.48 468.69 B: yeah i mean that's cool and like fear factor fear factor the same thing if you can see yourself eating some of that junk or putting up with a little bit of that stuff you know you have a chance of winning fifty grand 

468.75 474.04 A: yeah i've seen that i'm sorry i couldn't eat the junk i can't even watch them eat the junk so [laughter] 

472.59 473.41 B: no 

473.47 484.78 B: yeah i i could i mean i could i could eat a certain some of the stuff you know i mean if it's the blender one where it's all pureed and put into a martini glass that was okay i could do something like that 

483.25 489.69 A: i didn't see i don't see it that often i have seen that one now is a show like trading spaces considered a reality show 

489.49 491.43 B: (( trading spaces )) 

490.86 494.91 A: that's the decorating you know where the neighbors swap homes and do up each other's 

493.98 498.12 B: oh i suppose that c- oh i know that one yeah that could be i suppose i mean it's 

497.40 499.45 A: now see i love that show [laughter] 

499.32 508.39 B: that's kind of reality 'cause i mean the neighbors doing their the only thing i i mean i i've watched a couple of those and it's just not not real enough i mean it's 

508.19 515.38 B: i don't know i mean it's they just don't seem that candid about it you know when they actually come and see it some of those ones i don't know which one i've seen but 

514.48 521.50 A: oh yes i've seen some i've seen some people swear and cry and have to say i have to leave the room 

517.76 518.79 B: oh really 

520.94 522.21 B: oh wow 

521.89 523.09 A: [laughter] 

522.42 526.22 B: and then what they do what do they get to do to that room 'cause that's their room right 

525.59 532.27 A: it's their room so they can do whatever they want to change it back if they want to repaint if they want to whatever it's on them though 

526.35 527.41 B: their house 

531.12 532.01 B: (( wow )) 

532.11 537.92 B: well that would be fun to go on see i'd i'd like to go on that but i'd make sure that whoever's redoing it i- you know 

533.59 534.30 A: [laughter] 

538.01 542.99 B: has my tastes or something do you pick do you pick who who redoes it 

540.22 541.01 A: yes 

542.38 548.75 A: i don't think so see i would do it if i could pick 'cause i know the person that i would want to have my room done by 

548.44 554.18 B: yeah 'cause then you know that's hopefully in the same sort of realm of what you want and you 

554.43 557.09 B: you nearly get what you want but with their flair 

557.20 561.55 A: right and i've seen the ones that seem to listen to the homeowners 

561.77 569.49 A: or the people that just go with their own idea and just do it regardless of what the rest of the house looks like what the people have said they want or don't want [laughter] 

568.82 580.25 B: yeah yeah 'cause i watched one and this woman was a little freaked out and i mean the house it didn't go with the house at all it's like all this black and browns and the rest of her house was all fresh and happening and here's this dark 

581.17 583.20 B: weird thing but yeah yeah 

582.06 588.80 A: and that's the thing about trading spaces it's the drama of it if the people don't like it and whatever but otherwise it's just decorating 

586.85 589.93 B: well that that's probably reality 

589.33 596.33 A: it's just decorating otherwise and there's other decorating ones like that similar vein but i can't say that i've seen them 

596.34 599.89 B: yeah i don't know what else is oh oh is well i suppose
