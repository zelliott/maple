55.71 56.90 B: um 

58.16 62.00 B: i have no idea really i guess just m- 

62.69 70.81 B: because maybe people can like relate to the other people and everyone has like you know a dream of just being on t._v. 

65.89 67.43 A: yeah probably 

71.43 72.92 A: yeah yeah 

72.70 76.77 B: ah and like you know i i know a lot of people that watch them and like 

77.07 83.54 B: are always like oh i'm going to be on survivor [sigh] and like you know they're going to submit everything but you know they never do 

84.36 94.40 A: oh yeah yeah yeah so do you think that that it's actually do you think that um these shows are really real t- reality t._v. or are these people are actors 

94.80 95.83 B: um 

98.18 103.71 B: they're ah probably like it depends on the show because like i know 

103.97 108.06 B: like a lot of times they actually you know like hire people 

107.99 110.65 A: yeah that's what i've heard too yeah 

108.32 109.47 B: to do it 

110.04 115.09 B: but i mean i- i'm sure like some of the time it's actually like 

114.85 116.23 A: yeah 

115.67 119.57 B: (( reality but uh i don't know not who knows )) 

120.23 123.47 B: sometimes the people are just a little too dramatic though 

123.44 125.05 A: yeah i yeah i 

123.97 126.80 B: but like 'cause i watch the real world sometimes 

126.62 127.62 A: uh-huh 

127.15 133.66 B: and yeah there's a lot of drama on that it doesn't seem like those are how actually you know people are 

130.86 131.59 A: [mn] 

133.72 138.53 A: yeah yeah i watched the osbournes one time and i was like no 

138.51 153.34 A: 'cause this was like too much i mean i don't know you know it it was like um they went shopping for furniture and then they bought puppies and it was just like who wants to see that you know and then they cleaned up the dog poop 

153.00 154.38 B: [laughter] [laughter]

159.80 173.89 B: yeah i used to i watched it i was like obsessed with it [laughter] but i don't know like i i wouldn't count that like reality t._v. though 'cause i mean that's really not realistic unless you're like a millionaire 

163.80 165.51 A: [laughter] 

171.13 172.60 A: yeah you're right yeah 

174.11 175.14 A: (( [laughter] ))

177.56 179.56 A: (( yeah yeah yeah you're right )) 

179.41 182.65 B: but it's i don't know it's pretty funny [laughter]

183.95 185.61 A: and um 

185.82 195.31 A: [lipsmack] so what about these dating shows um like um 'cause they're kind of like reality t._v. too you know um like meet the parents or something like that

196.97 204.59 B: i haven't really um the o- i think the only one i've seen is like joe millionaire that sort of but i don't know 

204.49 208.94 A: i haven't seen it i've seen pictures of joe millionaire everywhere 

204.67 205.50 B: i 

208.52 209.89 B: yeah 

209.16 211.63 A: but i've never seen the show actually 

211.18 216.89 B: it's it's pretty lame like all the it i don't know i don't like the dating ones 'cause 

217.10 218.64 B: it's just like 

218.81 221.67 A: no you don't i i think they're funny 

221.62 232.28 B: well yeah they're funny but like they make me sad [laughter] 'cause you know it's like i don't know if the people are actually serious and like think like what they actually think they are going to get out of it 

228.83 230.43 A: (( yeah i don't think they're )) 

232.06 237.76 B: like when that um the who wants to marry a millionaire thing was on a couple of years ago 

236.14 237.05 A: mhm 

237.85 239.79 B: like that was just bizarre 

240.52 242.33 A: (( yeah yeah yeah i know )) 

242.85 244.70 A: and um 

244.77 250.14 A: what about like um reality like cop you know that one cops 

249.89 250.95 B: (( mhm )) 

250.96 252.49 A: what do you think about that one 

252.78 254.34 B: um 

256.19 259.00 B: i don't know i've never really watched it but like 

259.36 262.78 B: like my dad's always watching it [laughter] 

262.01 269.09 A: it's a little scary to me sometimes like when you see how people get arrested or you know somebody was beating up 

268.82 270.19 B: yeah 

269.59 276.51 A: his girlfriend and and i don't know with stuff like that i don't really like to see it i don't think it should be on t._v. but 

275.72 282.05 B: it's kinda l- like weird that they'll be arresting someone with like a camera following [laughter] it though 

281.42 286.69 A: i know i know i know if that was me i would never agree to that [laughter] 

287.08 289.06 B: [laughter] yeah it's just bizarre 

289.07 290.55 A: yeah 

290.59 295.63 A: and then it's just you know sometimes things that i don't really want to see like i don't know 

295.13 296.23 B: yeah 

295.44 302.48 A: so many problems and arguments everywhere so to me these you know like who wants to be a millionaire or something like that 

302.28 312.72 A: is at least more i- it's nicer it's a little more entertaining where some of 'em are just like for example that cops i think it's kind of disgusting but [laughter] i don't know [sigh] 

310.93 315.84 B: yeah yeah like i guess the dating ones are like all right they're just 

316.27 323.29 B: i don't know it's it's kind of like good to like look at other people though and be like wow i i would never do that [laughter] 

323.44 324.79 A: yeah 

324.99 326.85 A: what about um

355.15 356.31 A: (( oh yeah [laughter] )) 

356.06 358.19 B: mhm like i remember um 

358.36 363.35 B: i was doing drivers ed and my instructor was like obsessed with survivor 

363.31 371.59 B: like to the point that it was like sick [laughter] and like the entire car ride every day all she would do is talk about survivor 

366.10 367.50 A: really 

371.50 379.45 B: and like listen to the radio and try to like hear what happened and um it was it was yeah it was pretty scary [laughter]

387.00 391.52 B: on online and it's just i don't know that's pretty crazy 

391.78 400.82 A: that's too much then i don't know i know um w- uh when i was still in chicago there was um auditions for temptation island 

400.11 401.55 B: oh wow [laughter] 

401.15 405.89 A: and um there was a lot of people going there too and they were looking for couples 

405.68 406.52 B: uh-huh 

406.28 412.31 A: and then a couple of uh people showed up and claimed they were porn stars and [laughter]

414.44 415.40 B: yeah 

415.48 418.43 B: people do anything to just get on t._v. mhm

421.17 430.73 A: well see i don't i wouldn't want to be i don't know like i'm in l._a. so like i was asked if i wanted to be in like um blind date or extreme dating or stuff like that 

430.61 439.83 A: and they pay you like three hundred dollars but i didn't want to because that's not you know i would not want to be on t._v. for something like that i i'd rather not be on t._v. 

437.62 441.77 B: i don't think it's worth it for three hundred dollars like 

442.01 443.01 B: (( i don't know )) 

442.99 444.30 A: would you have gone 

444.33 451.51 B: for three hundred dollars um probably not i i like maybe if they paid me a lot more [laughter]

456.62 459.69 A: but it yeah no but a lot of people i don't know 

460.61 468.75 A: i guess that you know because it's so popular these shows are so popular that um maybe they think they get discovered or something 

468.48 469.59 B: yeah 

468.83 473.30 A: i don't know i don't think it's the case but people think so [mn] 

472.87 478.21 B: uh they do sometimes i guess like that woman from um who wants to marry a millionaire 

478.15 479.02 A: uh-huh 

478.56 485.46 B: she was in like playboy after and everything so yeah like i think sometimes like

499.82 500.80 A: (( yeah )) 

500.25 501.55 B: yeah 

500.95 508.73 A: yeah probably and do you think that they're more popular in like the bigger cities or more like i don't know somewhere in the country are

526.66 529.27 A: i guess they i don't know [laughter] 

528.01 531.02 B: it's like a completely different mentality so 

531.01 532.18 A: yeah 

532.84 539.57 A: and um when did these shows come out though when did they really get popular like ten years ago five years ago 

539.60 545.26 B: pretty recently like they got really popular like there's always been like the ones on m._t._v.

545.51 546.54 B: and stuff 

545.76 546.75 A: uh-huh

552.59 553.65 A: okay

561.26 570.33 A: and um i don't know and i i never talk about these shows with my friends but i remember um there w- i had a job once as a cashier somewhere
