62.66 63.72 B: yeah actually it's 

64.61 65.48 B: (( probably )) 

65.86 71.13 B: yeah probably i'd probably have to say maybe smoking especially if i'm out at a restaurant 

68.75 69.67 A: smoking 

71.00 71.61 A: (( [mn] )) 

71.16 80.68 B: and um you know if i'm dining um you know i i kind of i find that ah somewhat offensive there um 

73.13 73.69 A: (( [noise] )) 

79.19 80.65 A: right 

81.33 82.53 B: but 

82.83 83.91 B: um 

84.04 88.75 B: especially more so with your cigar smoking and pipe smoking 

88.67 89.99 A: i see mm 

89.42 93.42 B: than yeah although you know occasionally i will smoke a cigar 

90.73 91.75 A: (( what )) 

93.34 101.94 A: i see well i'm actually a a i'm actually a smoker myself but i mean i have i have two children so i mean i'm real cognizant of it 

94.01 94.96 B: yeah 

97.27 98.16 B: okay 

101.48 102.63 B: yeah 

102.21 117.13 A: you know i don't smoke around my kids and i don't smoke in the car and i don't smoke in the house or anything like that so i mean i know how it is ah because most of them have problems and i mean it's my choice you know th- the way i see it i know most people don't at all but i see it as my choice and 

106.09 108.44 B: (( mm )) 

117.24 127.66 A: you know to smoke and if i want to do it i should you know with myself and that's it you know if somebody joins me that's one thing but i shouldn't push it on anybody else just like anything else like cussing or 

124.59 125.65 B: yeah 

127.64 137.36 B: yeah i i i think ah i think a lot of this is ah you know it depends on the environment if i were at at a movie i would find gossiping 

132.82 134.40 A: exactly mm 

137.60 146.54 B: you know ah you know individuals who are you know ah you know whether they're they've seen the movie and they're gossiping about the movie or whether it's about 

137.74 139.44 A: right that's true 

146.84 148.41 B: you know ah 

147.06 148.77 A: nothing to do with the movie 

148.42 150.03 B: (( nothing to do with the movie )) 

149.21 151.23 A: [laughter] right 

150.15 151.94 B: right um that bothers me 

151.61 152.85 A: exactly 

152.63 153.59 B: um 

153.60 157.12 B: so i mean how about yourself what do you find offensive 

156.95 158.08 A: um 

158.44 168.23 A: mm i'm really not easily offended i i i i mean anything's disrespectful is is most offensive to me i mean regardless of you know the person 

165.11 165.97 B: (( mhm )) 

168.23 179.70 A: that's receiving it or that's giving it i mean i don't think there's any reason ever for anybody to be respectful at all like you know if you really if if you have a respect then you know it makes the world go around i think 

175.09 175.99 B: yeah 

179.93 189.82 A: and you know it makes even life a lot easier for everybody and just makes the life the world just a lot easier to live in if people just have mutual respect from the beginning 

190.10 200.70 A: i mean if i'm going to the grocery store and i'm having a bad day you know there's no point in me taking it out on the guy who's bagging my groceries or putting them in the car you know i mean he's got a job to do and that's what he's doing it 

200.59 206.00 A: i mean likewise if he has a bad day i mean he shouldn't you know smash my eggs down into the back seat of my car 

205.47 207.14 B: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

206.34 218.25 A: you know i mean it's it it goes both ways you know and that's ah i guess maybe it's mostly about pet peeves that we're supposed to be a- a- a- that's the way i see it anyway and that's like the biggest one i have i mean 

207.50 208.43 B: yeah 

218.37 228.39 A: i give out respect to people and i just expect it back you know there's no reason i mean unless i do something offensive or wrong i mean i don't really see any reason at all 

228.49 235.59 A: for anybody to to do that and that's pretty much where i am i mean if you drink that's your business if you smoke it's your business if you 

235.62 236.62 B: yeah 

235.78 243.17 A: gossip sometimes i get in on it sometimes i don't you know [laughter] but i mean for the most part it's it's it's respect issues [noise] 

242.97 249.54 B: my big thing was smoking um this is ah i don't know you know i guess 

249.68 255.65 B: many years ago and you know how they at least when i was going through high school and and how they used to teach ya 

255.78 258.98 B: you know second hand smoke is you know 

257.47 258.94 A: (( [noise] right )) 

258.94 272.22 B: takes ages you know just as bad as whether you know it's almost equivalent to as if you were smoking you know but then again you know i think um you know in public places now the the designate areas for individuals to 

264.62 266.05 A: (( [noise] [noise] exactly [noise] )) 

272.35 280.32 B: you know smoking like you said it's you know someone's choice and you know if i'm a non-smoker i don't particularly have to be in that in that particular area 

278.14 289.38 A: [noise] right [noise] yes i mean i personally if i'm in one of those areas and i'm smoking and somebody walks by and they make a face or they don't like it i mean to be quite honest with you i mean i particularly get offended i mean 

285.28 286.76 B: (( mhm mm )) 

289.81 294.07 A: this particular country was founded on the rights of our people and i mean just because 

294.05 305.23 A: i choose to smoke i mean that is my choice and i have the right to choose that i mean just the same as they have the right to not choose and if they choose not to that's okay i mean i'm going where i'm supposed to go to smoke a cigarette and 

305.33 312.79 A: you know i don't i mean i find comments like that particularly offensive because i'm doing what i'm supposed to do if if i make that choice i mean i'm not 

312.72 321.50 A: doing it outside of an area or i'm not forcing it on anybody and i mean i do get that myself like people will walk by and they'll like start choking and they'll look at me and it 

321.49 333.31 A: it's like well i mean it's clearly marked that this is an area and if it's something that irritates you or bothers you i mean there's always a way around that area so you know i mean in a in a sense that's offensive to me as well 

330.21 331.22 B: yeah 

333.16 344.44 B: yeah see see see some things they will you know when we consume alcohol the only person you really you know ultimately are hurting or affect- it affects you you know what i mean 

333.52 334.89 A: so you know i mean 

343.52 345.33 A: exactly ye- yes 

344.41 349.78 B: unless ah ah you know unless you go to the extreme of ah you know 

349.97 356.29 B: in- intoxication and you ah get behind the wheel of a car and you you you wind up you know ah well 

352.40 353.36 A: right 

355.32 365.22 A: right or you're pregnant i mean i i i i find that offensive i mean i find that extremely offensive women who are pregnant and drink you know i've i've i've seen people do that 

356.98 359.82 B: or exactly exactly yeah that's a good point 

360.97 367.51 B: so that i mean like see i don't find drinking i i think drinking is a great social thing you know 

366.98 377.60 A: right i mean i'm the same way i mean i'm completely the same way but i mean i've i've actually seen somebody who was pregnant and drinking and i was just like what are you thinking i mean i mean to me that is 

372.66 374.18 B: (( um yeah )) 

377.40 392.11 A: highly offensive i mean it's it's disrespect for life it's it's disres- you know it's irresponsibility completely i mean there's nobody who forced that person to have sex nobody forced that person to have a child you know or to get pregnant and i mean you're not you know 

388.86 389.89 B: (( mhm )) 

392.22 394.97 A: you're not being responsible with the gift that you have 

395.06 403.74 A: so i mean i but i'm i'm the same way i mean i i know people who find drinking very offensive and like you say i mean as long as you're not i 

403.55 415.47 A: mean there are people who get drunk and get very belligerent you know what there's also people who drink and can't handle it and they choose not to drink because of that and somehow they have some problems with it usually because they can't handle it their self 

406.11 407.20 B: (( mhm )) 

415.61 429.49 A: but i mean i'm a drinker i'm a smoker [laughter] i mean i'm you know but at the same time i'm you know again it goes back to i'm very respectful of other people and their choices i don't ever force it upon anyone or 

418.46 420.31 B: [laughter] 

423.65 424.47 B: (( are you )) 

429.42 436.05 A: you know if somebody doesn't want it in their house i'm not going to bring it in their house and i'm not going to smoke around anybody else if they find it [mn] 

436.11 437.01 A: you know 

437.16 438.30 B: yeah

529.26 540.18 B: you know my my mom she would smoke right before we were you know before i was finished eating and i mean that's something for for um going back to my childhood that really bothered me you know 

539.51 540.45 A: right

580.17 589.73 A: you know i've made a conscious decision that i mean not right now i'm not going to do it right now but within the next three or four years i mean i'm going to stop because i mean when i grew up i saw my mom smoking 

589.69 599.95 A: and it sounds really silly i mean nobody really understands it i guess unless they've been in it but it's like i never smoking as being a bad thing because my mom did it and i realised you're one of m- 

598.23 599.29 B: yeah
