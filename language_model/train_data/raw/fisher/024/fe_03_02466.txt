101.36 114.03 B: i you know i've often wondered that myself that was i was when they asked that question i was hm why do people [mn] i think there's a lot of people that are into voyeurism and so that they like watching that and um [mn]

122.12 129.32 B: there's there's both ends of it you either like you either like to expose yourself so people see you 

129.74 130.83 A: yeah 

129.76 136.28 B: [mn] or you're on the other spectrum where you're the one who likes to watch people and you usually do it you know 

136.22 137.31 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

136.68 150.73 B: on the sly type thing [mn] um i think there are a lot of people that must be into that and then too um i don't know people just [mn] i guess they think it'll make i don't know why people watch it [noise] i can't understand it 

151.56 153.90 A: oh do you know what that beep

167.13 168.35 A: ah i see 

167.95 168.92 B: um 

169.08 173.61 B: but no i guess that the voyeurism is the th- that and 

173.73 183.63 B: i don't know my my one friend i have a one friend she call- she's like she thinks it's like the dumbing down of people because it doesn't challenge you to think of anything 

183.54 184.67 A: huh 

184.15 190.03 B: [mn] when you're watching t._v. you know you don't have to think about it doesn't challenge you in in any way 

189.81 190.72 A: yeah 

190.51 193.41 B: it's just it's just pure entertainment 

193.41 198.37 A: yeah [mn] i know when when i i started watching joe 

198.50 210.77 A: millionaire it was because i liked the idea that well let's see if they choose him for love i kind of got into that idea 'cause normally i don't watch like just to watch the bachelor or something [mn] 

211.29 211.85 B: (( [mn] )) 

211.35 216.48 A: that's kind of why i started watching it and i thought he was kind of cute and stuff [laughter] 

215.57 222.45 B: yeah yeah he is real cute i didn't ever watch it um i saw him on some talk shows and stuff and they always of course 

222.35 224.96 B: it it it got real interesting of course th- 

224.74 237.45 B: they peak it up really good with their commercials you know i don't know [mn] like i never really watched survivor but then there was that time where they showed that alligator and the guy actually got burnt but they made it look like in the commercial he was going to get attacked by an alligator 

227.85 229.08 A: yeah 

236.91 238.30 A: oh yeah 

237.66 245.26 B: you know and of course it's the last thing they show and i watched that episode because the hype from the from the commercial i was like whoa you know 

245.79 249.18 B: i think other people get hyped up from the commercials too 

248.65 250.01 A: oh yeah 

249.32 255.06 B: but then every talk show of course you know talks to every- talks about it and

266.10 270.64 B: i always wondered with these people like don't they work i mean you know 

269.03 271.41 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

270.70 276.28 B: not too many jobs let you off for long periods of time if you don't win that million dollars i don't know what you'd do 

275.96 277.13 A: oh yeah 

276.14 285.83 B: i guess i could see with survivor because it seems like they get to you know sponsor television you know commercials that's the people who do it but the people who watch it i don't know what they get out of it 

285.38 288.03 A: yeah and then 

287.30 293.44 B: i have a friend who really gets into it though boy after she'll watch 'em she'll call me and tell me all about 'em and [mn]

323.84 330.09 A: i think people put them in the the people's place like ooh could i do that am i that brave you know [mn] 

329.56 337.20 B: mhm i think a lot of it is a challenge to people [lipsmack] you know they're not challenged somewhere else so they 

336.28 338.08 A: i don't think i could 

338.14 340.90 A: eat those things or whatever

370.31 375.71 B: i'm not really afraid of snakes too who- whole heck of a lot but you're not going to pour snakes on me 

375.48 376.67 A: yeah

385.05 391.50 B: [mn] yeah oh no so it doesn't h- ah i don't get into 'em [mn] 

391.59 405.41 B: um i'm real disappointed actually in them and i don't understand why people watch 'em because they're getting so popular that they're taking over um the the shows and if you have regular programming i don't know what people watch 

405.12 408.19 A: oh yeah you have to have cable huh 

405.86 407.28 B: (( you know because )) 

407.67 415.07 B: yeah if you don't have cable you're stuck with reality t._v. or paid programming and that's another thing i can't get over people watching these commercials 

415.18 416.08 A: (( uh-huh )) 

416.53 423.70 B: gosh i can't you don't get enough commercials in between your shows you gotta sit there and watch a whole thirty minute spiel [laughter]

426.70 427.85 B: yeah 

427.67 435.77 B: on regular t._v. i was looking and i was thinking golly 'cause [mn] what do the kids watch when they get home from school judge joe brown or paid programming 

435.06 437.22 A: [laughter] 

435.53 445.05 B: [mn] yeah there's a generation of ah credit cards let's spend all your money i guess that's why you gotta get into reality pr- t._v. you're thinking hm can i do that [laughter] 

444.36 448.58 A: so the the the court shows are they're reality t._v. too are they 

448.18 450.80 B: yeah i guess they are [mn] and 

449.95 452.56 A: oh i get i- i get into those 

451.94 465.31 B: now some of them aren't too bad because of course you know it's case law so [mn] law is law you know there's not a whole lot you can do with the law so it is interesting because you learn you know [mn] where the law stands on things 

460.96 461.76 A: right 

464.73 466.10 A: right 

465.26 471.36 B: you learn about contract law and stuff like that i don't want to see people's divorces aired on t._v. 

471.11 472.27 A: (( ah [mn] )) 

471.82 473.80 B: i like the civil ones [lipsmack] 

474.38 476.51 B: if it's a good civil suit 

476.14 477.45 A: right 

476.59 485.88 B: i always like to see it contractual i like to see it if they're contractual then i'll i'll watch them 'cause i always like to see how they're gonna you know go on that one 

485.56 486.94 A: yeah 

487.07 488.29 B: but um 

489.62 494.91 B: [mn] yeah that's about all i do i'm i think reality t._v. would you consider ah 

489.63 490.36 A: (( ah )) 

495.06 497.38 B: changing rooms reality t._v. 

497.58 500.14 B: 'cause i watch that all the time [laughter] 

499.38 500.94 A: what's it called ch- 

500.25 505.11 B: changing rooms trading spaces where they um decorate each other's homes 

504.75 511.49 A: oh yeah that's that's kind of a reality t._v. too but that's a nice that's not that's more nice [laughter] 

510.69 519.94 B: mhm i love those shows 'cause they they give you so many decorating ideas on how to do things inexpensively and they make so much and you [mn] 

520.37 521.88 B: i i like that 

521.77 524.98 A: what i really don't like is jerry springer [laughter] 

524.84 526.54 B: nah that does- 

525.77 529.23 A: 'cause i think that's sensationalized a lot the 

528.47 533.42 B: exploitation sensationalization all of that yeah oh it's good 

532.30 537.06 A: thing is some people really act like this you know if you see your neighbors get in a 

537.14 539.97 A: fight they really act crazy like this [mn] 

539.20 540.64 B: (( mhm )) 

541.13 545.89 A: but i mean i don't need to see it on t._v. 'cause it's all around the world anyway [mn] [mn] 

545.67 558.69 B: exactly some- do- don't you wonder though that these people get ah they get like desensitized to it because they see it on t._v. all the time they then they don't think it's there's anything different about it when they go out and do it in real life 

558.12 561.69 A: oh that's not a good idea 

561.32 575.92 B: you know that's what i think i think when children are watching like really bad shows and stuff after a while all the blood and the guts and the sex on t._v. [mn] well after by the time they're teenagers well heck that ain't nothing new to them they're so used to it 

574.29 575.25 A: yeah 

576.09 577.37 A: (( that's sad )) 

577.11 579.31 B: isn't it it's real sad [mn] 

579.84 582.63 B: it's just t._v. it's corruption 

583.88 593.95 B: of course you know not all the reality t._v. shows are they're not really into corruption i thought where they married that woman off was ridiculous and i don't know why anybody would watch that 

593.41 595.04 A: which one was that the 

594.53 598.74 B: (( the i think it might have been the first one where that woman married some guy the )) 

598.04 599.47 A: bachelor 

598.78 599.90 B: (( the ah n- ))
