14.70 17.66 A: i mean the other stuff seems minor 

18.03 24.68 B: um yeah i'd say except for maybe not exercising but yeah i'd i'll i'll i'll go with gossip 

24.27 28.31 A: well i mean basically everything you do is exercising really 

28.39 29.36 B: (( ah )) 

29.04 31.94 A: i mean unless you were to just lay down [laughter] all the time i 

31.58 35.20 B: if if you real- if you're really lazy 

34.60 38.37 A: mean you'd have to lay down on the couch all the time and not do a thing 

38.99 40.03 B: (( ah )) 

40.44 42.92 B: well i mean a- th- there's exercise

43.94 44.95 B: right 

50.03 53.49 B: well yeah that's what i said but um i ah 

54.93 64.60 B: i yeah i mean but there's exercise and there's really pushing yourself and doing the dishes may count as exercise but it's not like running or something 

64.09 73.47 A: but i definitely think gossiping i'm a military wife and [laughter] yeah [laughter] and i get a lot of that my neighbour and i'm like 

67.81 68.86 B: oh you are

107.21 108.53 B: (( [laughter] yes )) 

107.52 111.13 A: so i would definitely have to say gossiping 

110.56 114.08 B: yeah gossiping i think will win on this on this one pretty big 

114.72 116.93 B: (( i have a feeling )) 

115.60 118.26 A: 'cause i think it's kind of vicious 

116.94 117.82 B: yeah 

118.32 120.88 A: if we're doing that kind of thing 

122.59 126.14 A: but most of the time around here it's true [laughter] 

125.58 133.01 B: well i'm i'm i'm sure that's you know what they said what they say in the in the military about they would agree to gossiping 

132.32 134.51 A: what were the other ones that said though 

134.37 135.47 B: um

146.84 149.83 A: i mean i 'cause that would be a personal choice 

149.42 150.99 B: but yeah i think most 

150.17 153.93 A: who would we to be to judge somebody [laughter] for what they eat 

153.53 162.05 B: i think most of the other ones had ah was there but those other ones had affects i think on um

167.24 168.53 A: yeah 

169.02 174.05 A: i mean everything else it seems like it would be it was more of a personal decision 

174.56 176.46 A: i don't think it would be like 

176.62 177.88 A: anything 

177.93 181.68 A: that i would say okay you shouldn't do that [laughter]

194.02 196.06 B: but you know um 

195.94 198.05 A: it's an overall personal thing 

197.86 199.86 B: yeah exactly 

199.47 202.38 A: like my neighbour had gastric bypass surgery

258.31 261.89 A: up on the couch and gain some weight [laughter] 

261.28 270.55 B: right but you know i i guess some people just are luckier than others and the area of keeping weight off 

269.46 272.38 A: i mean she had been like that since she was born

368.19 369.97 A: [laughter] 

370.42 372.39 A: [laughter] 

373.39 378.09 A: i think that's what all these talks are supposed to be about they you kind of 

376.46 377.67 B: about what 

379.53 381.98 B: um i've never done this before so i'm 

381.26 386.41 A: i haven't either this is like the first time i think they tried to call like two or three times and 

386.54 393.46 A: i didn't know what it was on the caller i._d. and then i just got the email and it's funny i was looking at the email right as the phone rang 

393.60 397.02 A: i was like that was spooky [laughter] 

396.33 401.75 B: r- really 'cause see i um y- yeah i i just signed up for it today i had no 

402.10 404.44 B: idea when the phone rang and um then 

404.67 410.14 B: there was this delay and i heard this automated voice so it kind of made sense what it was 

410.41 415.62 A: but what are the odds that i would have been looking at that email 'cause i had signed up for it like last night 

415.98 421.15 A: and i had seen the number pop up and i was like i don't know anybody in college [laughter] 

421.16 423.49 B: how how did you find out about this 

422.90 425.74 A: um one of my friends sent me an email 

425.54 426.92 B: (( oh well )) 

426.26 432.51 A: yeah last night or yesterday and i was like oh okay [laughter] 

433.15 443.36 A: i used to actually do studies for the university of pennsylvania they would have a little survey to do like once a month and you get paid like three bucks or something for 'em 

440.55 441.58 B: oh really 

443.90 447.23 A: yeah a little ah like research studies 

447.43 451.52 A: i guess they're doing this now instead 'cause they don't do those anymore 

452.44 456.47 B: m- maybe i and i saw in one of the the local newspapers ah so 

456.71 459.96 B: i decided to sign up this morning 'cause um 

458.54 461.05 A: 'cause they used to do those instead 

461.34 464.17 A: they would do 'em on the internet you would just um 

464.43 467.28 A: i guess they'd have them like maybe once a week 

467.74 474.25 A: and you'd sign up for 'em and you'd get paid like three bucks to do this study but the studies were for ever long 

475.35 478.40 A: i just did 'em 'cause the questions were interesting [laughter] 

478.29 479.34 B: right 

478.71 484.16 A: [laughter] yeah they were crazy some of the questions were whacked out [laughter] 

484.35 486.57 B: (( [mn] so how does this work after um )) 

486.48 487.36 A: huh 

487.07 489.66 B: after ten minutes i guess they tell us 

489.85 493.81 A: yeah it tells you and it asks you to give it feedback or whatever 

493.78 494.61 B: (( oh )) 

493.93 499.10 A: this is kind of interesting though i was wondering what kind of questions they were going [laughter] to ask i was like ah 

498.01 501.19 B: yeah i had no idea what it was about ah i 

501.77 504.13 B: figured it was maybe some 

504.21 509.33 B: form of psychological research associated with it um 

507.89 511.52 A: they probably want to know what you're going to start talking about 

510.63 511.60 B: um 

512.29 513.26 B: yeah i 

513.64 521.49 A: [mn] they probably have people like hey where are you from baby [laughter] it'd be like [laughter]
