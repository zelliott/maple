4.19 9.23 A: okay i guess reality t._v. huh [laughter] do you watch 

6.77 8.02 B: yes 

9.01 15.09 B: um some of it i do yes we got completely hooked on survivor the first few times 

14.64 15.63 A: okay 

15.40 16.53 B: how about you 

16.06 26.64 A: um i watch bits and pieces of it i'm not really into that too much ah i don't know it seems to get trashier the the more shows that come out and all that so um 

23.30 24.33 B: (( yeah )) 

26.13 36.60 B: i agree with that they i- i'm not as obsessed with survivor this time as the first few times the first time was just i could not miss an episode 

27.13 28.24 A: (( i'm thinking )) 

32.34 33.22 A: right 

35.85 37.03 A: (( right [mn] )) 

36.71 40.70 B: but it's kind of gotten less with each passing one 

40.13 47.75 A: right i think the first one ah you know it's a it was a new show it was well probably the first real reality show so ah 

46.45 47.83 B: oh yes 

48.12 50.33 A: everyone wanted to see it but then 

50.39 53.46 A: i don't know for me it got kind of boring and 

52.61 66.57 B: well it there is a sa- certain sameness and just the same people get dirty and raggedy and and ah the girls it's pretty evident i think at this point that they're hiring them for how they look and 

55.60 56.61 A: right 

66.15 67.48 A: right 

66.65 69.84 B: not how th- how good they look in the least clothes they can find 

69.23 75.39 A: that's right well i don't watch it any more [laughter] so yeah any other any other shows that you watch or 

70.18 71.10 B: [laughter] 

71.22 72.34 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

75.05 79.99 B: ah we've kinda gotten into american idol which i guess is sort of a reality show too 

77.65 78.61 A: (( oh yeah )) 

79.03 81.36 A: right that's true yes mm 

80.34 92.79 B: yeah so um we've been k- we didn't really watch the first one and then my husband really got interested in it and um [mn] this time we've watched every one of those we have our favorites and you know 

90.42 91.99 A: (( is that right well )) 

92.08 101.56 A: i guess my husband isn't really into them so that's part of the reason i don't watch them but ah he was actually interested in joe millionaire for some reason but um 

95.86 97.79 B: yeah yeah 

100.36 101.47 B: really 

101.78 103.32 A: you know i think 

102.67 106.98 B: i know some of those just kind of take you by surprise once you get interested in them 

105.16 109.42 A: that's right and how can people actually do that you know 

108.64 113.26 B: i know i've never understood that it's it's um 

113.48 121.97 B: sometimes i compare it to you know when you pass an accident and you just can't look away it's just like a morbid curiosity or something 

117.85 119.04 A: right 

121.31 123.70 A: right sure [laughter] 

122.86 124.08 B: and the the 

124.10 129.05 B: the ads this new one ah what is it mr personality where they all have the masks on and 

128.43 134.48 A: okay i hav- i've heard of it but i haven't really noticed the ads but [laughter] 

130.86 138.01 B: no i haven't watched it but i've just seen the ads for it and it's just oh [mn] they're getting worse and worse [laughter] 

136.76 140.09 A: i know i think there's gonna be a point where they just 

140.44 145.78 A: (( i don't know they lose popularity or something and there'll be there'll be something trashier out probably )) 

144.49 150.83 B: i think they're self destructing you know sort of like that ah who wants to be a millionaire phenomenon a couple of years ago 

146.03 147.83 A: (( i know so do )) 

148.98 151.81 A: i that's right yeah so 

150.86 155.41 B: [lipsmack] once it got to be on five days a week then people sort of lost interest [laughter] [laughter] 

154.46 160.50 A: that's right yeah and have you did you see married by america by any chance yeah 

158.77 161.59 B: no no i ah 

161.70 165.86 B: again saw the the ah previews on t._v. of that and um 

165.74 167.38 A: right 

166.38 169.87 B: just think how can people possibly do that 

169.16 173.48 A: i know i saw one show and you could just feel how nervous they were and 

172.85 174.46 B: oh yes 

174.12 177.10 A: and i don't think any of them turned up [laughter] 

174.58 175.41 B: oh we 

176.60 181.14 B: i don't yeah i don't know how it finally ended up if any of them actually got married ah 

181.10 189.03 A: i don't think i what i do is i check the website just to see who's made the next round and i think they they all called it off [laughter] 

184.55 185.41 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

188.12 190.54 B: well i think that's probably smart 

190.11 191.60 A: right 

190.65 200.88 B: [mn] we did watch um my husband is is an inveterate flipper as you know i think most men are and and he ran across that ah what was it meet my parents 

195.40 196.51 A: mhm 

196.87 198.29 A: right 

200.68 201.63 A: okay 

201.17 205.40 B: and so we did watch that a couple of times and that was very interesting 

203.20 204.12 A: right 

204.81 206.35 A: (( is that right oh okay )) 

205.93 209.04 B: um they ah did you ever see that one 

208.78 213.76 A: um no i just read about it and it sounded like it was a bomb so i didn't didn't even bother 

211.98 213.29 B: oh it was 

213.42 215.77 B: it was so weird i mean 

215.35 216.53 A: really 

215.80 229.44 B: it especially when it was the guys that were going to the girl's house and you think the parents are i don't know i got the feeling they're almost pimping their daughter you know to go for a weekend in las vegas or hawaii or somewhere with some guy and 

226.54 229.50 A: right [laughter] boy 

229.72 241.80 B: i just thought uh i don't know but i- it's again just fascinating and [mn] it was one of those things i think that just lasted like an hour and it was over with that was it it wasn't a you know a week to week kind of thing so 

240.25 241.58 A: right sure 

242.02 243.67 B: you kind of got the 

243.70 247.56 B: decision that nigh so it was easier to watch it i think 

246.75 257.75 A: right i g- i guess why they're so popular people just relate to them or i don't know 'cause it's it's real people and doing real things even though the cameras are in their face i'm sure 

251.68 252.88 B: (( i guess )) 

253.71 254.53 B: yeah 

254.70 255.74 B: yeah 

257.24 258.62 B: oh i can't imagine 

257.85 260.17 A: a lot of it is ad lib and 

260.19 267.50 B: well and that that could be i guess you or me up there i guess that's the you know sort of the pull is that anybody can get into these things 

263.62 266.11 A: that's right yeah well 

266.72 268.68 A: that's right not me 

268.00 269.53 B: no no i 

268.82 271.19 A: [laughter] but you know it's possible 

269.54 270.32 B: wouldn't 

270.80 272.95 B: well did you ever watch big brother 

272.47 278.19 A: um [mn] i watched a bit of the first season but it i found it kind of boring not 

276.95 282.54 B: again yeah yeah that i didn't really care what they were doing twenty four seven and 

281.74 283.35 A: (( that's right so )) 

282.95 291.40 B: i they that's one thing i like about survivor they seem to edit it very well that you don't have long periods of just nothingness you know 

287.77 289.01 A: right 

290.31 297.90 A: that's right and the the scenery is nice and i don't know they they have a lot of different conflicting personalities 

293.31 294.45 B: yes 

297.20 299.77 B: yeah always [laughter] 

298.23 299.85 A: [laughter] 

300.08 314.75 B: when i saw the guy on ah letterman the other day he you know he still has the latest survivor that's kicked off and and he said what was the most outstanding thing or something and he said the boredom he said it's just horrible there's nothing to do you can 

306.21 307.02 A: uh-huh 

313.87 316.36 A: [noise] right [laughter] 

314.80 326.32 B: you know you just you can only stare at the fire for so many hours a day and and we don't see that because they're following everybody and interviewing them individually so they they do a good j- editing job of that anyway 

318.80 321.24 A: right that's right 

323.20 324.44 A: right 

325.07 330.91 A: yeah and people say h- how they made them look like a nasty person and they're really a nice person 

329.30 330.23 B: [laughter] 

330.29 332.13 B: yeah [laughter] it's funny 

331.13 332.84 A: [laughter] 

332.17 333.91 B: you've gotta wonder [laughter] 

333.24 336.78 A: that's right but i guess the money is the incentive for them 

335.92 343.30 B: i guess and in this day you'd think a million dollars isn't that much truthfully to put yourself through all that in 

340.04 340.90 A: no 

342.53 344.24 A: that's right yeah 

343.56 344.97 B: front of america 

344.74 347.15 A: but then you get the endorsements after 

346.75 349.94 B: oh yeah a lot of them do and and ah 

347.71 349.46 A: [laughter] 

349.74 353.48 A: so [cough] but i don't know why they're popular now 

353.28 354.02 B: i 

353.50 355.84 A: i'm just waiting for them to fade 

355.42 360.75 B: i guess yeah who knows what'll be the next big thing i'm almost afraid to find out [laughter] 

356.62 357.44 A: (( so )) 

358.49 359.60 A: right 

360.05 362.96 A: (( i know [laughter] so ))

379.50 381.86 B: (( oh i ugh )) 

382.09 386.90 B: just to find out what y- i guess what is the premise just to find our what your worst fear is and make you
