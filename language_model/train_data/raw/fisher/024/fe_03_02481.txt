152.10 153.18 A: mhm 

154.37 163.49 A: me either uh-uh i think people like that are desperate i think you should wait a woman should wait until a man finds her for marriage she shouldn't be out trying to 

163.41 168.48 B: mhm and shouldn't have it broadcast on t._v. and for all the 

163.98 164.82 A: (( you know )) 

166.22 167.60 A: (( mm mm )) 

167.79 168.83 A: no

169.75 170.82 A: i know 

171.37 179.10 B: [cough] what was that other question she said in the beginning i couldn't remember she said to talk about the programs and

179.45 181.37 B: then there was something else 

181.15 185.42 A: i can't remember either she i mean she goes so fast and sometimes her voice is low 

182.38 183.48 B: (( [laughter] )) 

185.57 189.79 A: so you know if you don't catch it all at first you just cannot like

198.72 199.87 A: (( um )) 

199.54 206.18 B: i don't even i can't even think of any right off the bat i was thinking of that american idol 

202.89 204.23 A: i can't either 

206.47 209.45 A: oh yeah american idol yeah [mn] um 

208.49 212.43 B: the but is that a reality show i don't know 

212.10 213.79 A: well i think they 

213.86 217.18 A: they compete against each other to see who who's gonna be 

217.58 220.35 A: the winner of whatever 

220.22 222.16 B: mhm 

220.57 227.63 A: but i've watched it a few times and you know they sing really good the ones that i've s- you know um 

227.78 228.93 A: watched 

228.65 231.29 B: mhm yeah 

229.46 240.02 A: and this the one guy who's the judge the last judge he usually judges people pretty harshly but the other night he was pretty nice [cough] he gave everybody a pretty good rating and everything so i was surprised 

240.38 241.35 B: oh 

240.49 247.19 A: but yeah i don't know how long they have to compete for but i think it's very expensive for them to you know 

247.23 248.32 B: yeah 

247.36 249.68 A: do that every week and everything and then 

249.90 255.20 A: um when they think that they're about to get ahead then that they get kicked off or whatever so 

255.50 257.21 A: i really don't know the 

257.62 258.94 A: [lipsmack] if i had a 

259.46 263.49 A: a child i don't know if i would really want them to invest that much into that 

262.58 268.28 B: mhm i don't think i've ever watched american idol 

267.72 269.89 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

268.70 273.27 B: i watched that something about child stars 

272.63 274.84 A: okay yeah i watched that once too 

274.06 277.19 B: but is that a reality t._v. [laughter] show 

277.14 279.59 A: (( i think it is but um )) 

279.25 285.88 B: or they had those they had some real you know like eight nine ten year old girl singing and 

283.05 284.07 A: (( mhm )) 

284.39 288.19 A: yeah they were really good w- that girl this one girl 

288.14 300.66 A: think she was ten i knew she played the piano i mean it was like wonderful i mean and she said she practised like three hours a day and you can tell because she was really really good and she won that night 

296.37 298.25 B: mhm 

298.77 300.70 B: yeah 

300.71 304.97 B: really yeah wonder if they'll have finals on that [cough] 

301.12 302.44 A: (( so mhm )) 

304.41 305.62 A: (( i don't know )) 

305.27 307.98 B: but i've only seen that once or twice 

307.52 309.31 A: me too i don't really 

308.39 315.18 B: when i did see it i thought oh i couldn't believe the girl that won she i don't think her voice was that good but 

314.52 318.64 A: [laughter] it it amazes me sometimes the people that do win [laughter] 

315.98 316.81 B: (( [laughter] )) 

318.06 324.66 B: you know and then she was dressed like her mom had sewed this dress and it was just absolutely ugly [laughter] 

323.93 327.81 A: oh no you would think she would want her to really look nice 

327.35 328.68 B: mhm 

327.86 330.21 A: sometimes they make 'em look too grown up too 

330.18 333.76 B: yeah it's like a lot of make up and stuff on 'em 

330.76 331.96 A: mhm 

331.97 334.10 A: mhm mhm 

334.17 338.51 A: and those outfits aren't even you know for kids their age sometimes 

337.80 339.95 B: [mn] yeah that's true 

339.46 340.57 A: mhm 

341.61 349.80 A: [lipsmack] so i don't know if it's good for the kids because i think that it's probably more pressure for them when they you know want them to do stuff like that 

350.22 351.60 A: but yeah 

350.26 354.71 B: trying to think yeah i bet the younger they are i think probably the worst it is 

352.26 353.67 A: mhm 

354.47 360.20 A: probably but some of them seem to really enjoy it you know performing and everything so 

355.74 357.75 B: but i still like fear factor 

360.45 368.38 A: but some kids are just really gifted and it doesn't bother bother them so i guess if you know if they're okay with it then it's all right 

367.26 369.32 B: mhm 

369.80 380.07 B: i don't know i still like fear factor that's about the only one i i watch and it's just kinda interesting to see what people do for all that money you 

374.64 375.73 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

379.89 382.68 A: yeah it is it's it's interesting 

380.93 382.24 B: (( know [laughter] )) 

382.91 385.57 B: (( kinda i don't know i guess )) 

387.04 389.73 B: i'm kinda getting tired of it i guess 

389.58 403.33 A: [lipsmack] yeah i did when i saw that that night i i my husband was kinda like getting into watching it but since that i haven't really you know think maybe i watched it once or twice after that but i don't get into it like i used to because 

390.48 391.77 B: (( but you know )) 

403.69 407.79 A: i would just rather watch a movie a pretty good movie on lifetime or something you know mhm 

407.57 411.45 B: oh yeah when they started it it was a lot 

412.56 416.67 B: i i don't know probably a lot worse i think than it was now 

416.17 417.37 A: probably 

417.09 421.34 B: 'cause they had to do you know stuff with snakes and 

419.90 420.78 A: (( mm )) 

421.21 422.31 A: gross 

422.17 427.59 B: really heavy duty gross stuff so 

423.16 424.66 A: mhm 

425.14 432.00 A: mhm [cough] yeah then one night they they had to get like all these fish eggs did you see that one 

431.95 433.09 B: (( fish eggs )) 

433.26 434.49 A: they had to 

434.10 435.90 B: (( oh i can't remember that one )) 

434.88 442.43 A: eat them uh th- they had to go and find them then they had to put 'em get so many and then they were like counting and 

442.52 443.99 A: then they had to eat them 

444.01 445.23 B: oh god 

445.10 458.36 A: mhm that was gross and it was th- the water was really murky and and dirty they could barely see but they did it and it was smelly and this one guy he he wouldn't do it though he says no i'm not doing it and he walked off i don't blame him 

449.95 452.67 B: mhm 

458.26 466.01 B: oh did you see that one where they had uh those dead rats and they had to take 'em by their mouth and throw 'em in a bucket 

463.28 464.07 A: oh 

465.46 467.21 A: oh 

466.94 471.83 B: i think i guess they were rat dead dead mice or dead rats or something 

470.74 474.85 A: oh that is making me sick to my stomach just thinking about it 

473.44 482.87 B: yeah and then they were that one time they were buried like buried in cockroaches and inside a casket or a oh god 

478.87 480.30 A: (( mm mm )) 

483.84 485.44 B: (( that )) 

484.56 489.16 A: i wonder who comes up with that stuff they must be they must really have a sick mind 

486.23 487.96 B: and i won- the 

488.76 494.17 B: yeah [laughter] one time they were in uh what las vegas and they had to go slide down the side of that building 

489.55 490.34 A: (( mm )) 

494.17 496.71 A: yeah i think i saw that mhm 

494.62 497.27 B: did you see that when they were in las vegas 

496.87 500.62 A: mhm was it um the was it men and women that did it 

499.26 503.36 B: mhm yeah 

501.16 503.35 A: yeah i saw that one yeah mhm 

503.65 508.77 B: (( but some of those some of those guys i don't know the girls usually seem like )) 

508.98 511.20 B: they win more than the guys do 

510.86 517.01 A: yeah 'cause they put their all into it if they made up their mind to really do it they just you know go all the way so 

513.09 515.14 B: (( yeah )) 

516.48 518.66 B: mhm 

517.25 519.53 A: you know sometimes they're better than the guys too 

519.55 521.19 B: yeah that's true 

520.91 521.74 A: (( you know )) 

523.15 526.95 B: so i don't know you think reality t._v.'s going to last 

527.02 536.95 A: um hm no not really i don't they gotta come up with something else you know to get the interest back i guess for it but i think it's like fading 

535.83 538.22 B: mhm 

537.66 539.63 A: they just come and they go you know 

538.70 546.04 B: it's like that uh show who wants to be a millionaire that used to be the big rage now it's kind of 

542.54 543.86 A: mhm 

544.59 546.08 A: mhm 

546.21 548.43 A: yeah it's it's filtering down 

548.12 549.30 B: (( kind of )) 

549.76 551.15 B: going away 

550.41 561.64 A: yeah and i don't think they pay enough anyway i think the last two people that are on should get something you know i- just not just one person you know just take it all it's really a cheap show i think 

558.96 561.51 B: mhm 

561.81 563.74 B: (( yeah )) 

562.27 563.91 A: for all that they have to go through 

565.14 573.51 B: yeah i kinda wonder how long those some of those have been on already those reality shows only it's a year or two 

565.92 567.14 A: mhm 

569.93 570.72 A: (( mm ))
