70.42 72.74 A: [laughter] you are a junkie what's the deal 

72.27 81.02 B: [laughter] i don't know what my problem is i just i guess you know i figure i can watch their problems for a while and just forget about my own [laughter] 

78.50 79.62 A: totally 

80.36 87.52 A: oh absolutely you know which one i have gotten into though i was really intr i was really interested in this mr personality 

83.63 84.79 B: what's that 

87.57 88.85 B: (( oh yeah )) 

88.57 93.10 A: that's the only one i've caught and gone hey that's actually kind of a wicked idea [laughter] 

93.16 102.58 B: oh that one i have i haven't done it but um i haven't watched it because we watched that uh married by america and it was such a joke that [mn] well 

101.63 103.43 A: oh was it awful 

103.22 108.35 B: [mn] it was pretty awful i mean nobody ended up getting married and it was it was 

107.31 108.72 A: [laughter] 

108.55 110.42 B: yeah no one got married 

109.32 111.63 A: [laughter] 

111.32 122.58 B: no they could back out they actually two couples went to the altar and um at the both at the altar the one girl that was supposed to get married to the guy she was totally like yeah let's do it 

118.16 119.62 A: (( oh seriously i )) 

121.79 122.61 A: (( thought they had )) 

122.61 132.11 B: and he told her no he he was who her family paired her up with and he he he told her no he was like i wanna know you better first and 

129.72 130.54 A: (( to yow )) 

131.44 132.95 A: [noise] 

132.05 138.05 B: then the other girl told the guy no because she didn't feel like her family cared about her 

138.27 143.78 B: or his family cared about her so they no one got married it was a big waste of money for fox i think 

138.64 139.49 A: (( oh no )) 

143.83 147.05 A: (( [laughter] oh that's awful [laughter] )) 

145.67 152.29 B: yeah [laughter] so i was like well i don't wanna watch this mr personality and get disappointed at the end again 

152.10 153.12 A: right 

153.37 155.01 B: at least survivor 

153.48 162.96 A: well no it's a it was it's a whole different uh i- i- it's a different thing but then then that's not it's it's all coming down to who she picks to to keep dating 

163.01 168.34 A: [mn] um and and it has nothing to do wi- with what he looks like 

168.73 174.58 B: yeah i know but then what happens when he pulls off the mask and then that's another like the the bachelor thing where 

174.47 183.96 B: you know or what was that um joe millionaire i mean they were so great together like on the show and everyone thought they were gonna 'cause i watched that and then you thought zora and the guy were 

182.82 185.44 A: i watched the the last couple of yeah 

185.46 191.36 B: well you really thought they were going to be together and then they kept them separated for a whole month well i think within that whole month 

190.13 196.86 A: no he was a little too interested in himself there was th- that was his main point of interest was him himself and him 

196.84 209.64 B: yeah but if you think about think about it i mean maybe the girl one with this mr personality will will work but if you notice that most of the ones that like have to do with a guy being the main star of it he starts enjoying the limelight and he 

207.38 208.13 A: yes 

208.98 209.77 A: yes 

209.51 213.69 B: gets all these other women throwing themselves at him and i don't think that 

212.47 214.64 A: well no what what guy wouldn't like that 

214.61 227.49 B: yeah so i think it's hard because joe millionaire did he did that and then um [lipsmack] uh the guy from the first bachelor he did that and that girl p- poor thing loved him to death and then 

226.41 228.76 A: [laughter] oh well that's hard 

227.99 242.82 B: she did and now she's all dumped and everything and then i think the second i don't know it just seems like the guys who get all that limelight and they don't like it but it looks like krista from the bachelorette which i didn't watch and it looks like she's going to stay with her man who knows [laughter] 

238.96 239.80 A: (( uh-huh )) 

242.22 243.24 A: (( oh we'll )) 

243.22 244.22 B: (( the um )) 

243.51 251.99 A: see n- no it just seemed it just seemed a lot more interesting sociologically speaking because who do we really fall in love with you know and and what happens when you know 

252.01 253.79 B: when the masks come off 

253.33 255.62 A: (( when the mask comes off yeah )) 

255.04 262.01 B: well you know usually the masks come off in regular dating about three months after you're dating so [laughter] and then you 

260.37 263.04 A: i know [laughter] exactly so 

261.96 272.50 B: because you see that real person and then y- you know [laughter] you'll know if you like them i don't know i guess i just th- that's my main thing for not watching that is i just don't want to be disappointed i don't wanna be like 

271.57 273.28 A: are you in a relationship right now 

273.17 275.20 B: i'm married yeah 

274.56 276.26 A: oh are you fabulous 

276.14 280.80 B: yeah i'm married and i have a a one child so and she's eight months old but 

280.61 291.55 B: i don't know i'm i'm just my husband doesn't like the reality shows my mom she can't believe i watch 'em she's like i can't believe you don't like people like that especially on survivor because they're real sneaky people 

285.06 285.65 A: (( [laughter] )) 

286.56 287.94 A: [laughter] 

291.45 301.32 B: she's like you don't like people like that i'm like i know but i like watching how they work man i'm like look at them they're just totally twisting the minds of these people and it 

291.47 292.70 A: yeah 

300.19 306.02 A: but no that's the that's the way the world works i mean i hate to be i hate to be ugly but it totally is 

302.73 303.85 B: (( it is )) 

306.03 319.03 B: i know it's coming on tonight and i can't wait to see what happens with poor rob because he has totally manipulated this game and he has got i mean it's going to be interesting because now he's he turned on some people that thought they thought he had 

313.03 313.94 A: real 

318.90 329.55 B: that they thought have strong alliances with and it's going to be interesting to see what happens now and i'm like 'cause he y- you know i kept saying rob watch what you're doing man you're ge- you're getting into hot water here and 

321.58 322.40 A: yeah 

328.96 330.61 A: [laughter] 

329.58 344.00 B: it came to it last week and so i'm excited to see now what's gonna happen because he really he threw a big monkey wrench into some plans there so [laughter] it's going to be that's why i guess i watch it i like to see what happens next because 

338.44 339.72 A: wow 

344.61 356.68 B: the control that people think they have and then who actually holds the control it's funny in the end when people are all cocky going oh i've got this in the bag and then it's like they're gone 

347.40 348.41 A: yeah 

355.50 366.01 A: well that's kind of always an illusion 'cause the uh control is always an illusion in your life and and i mean you really don't have any control of anything and once you accept that i mean it's kind of like y- 

366.20 366.88 A: uh 

367.60 372.42 A: saying you know once life is misery once you accept that everything becomes easier 

372.37 373.53 B: right 

372.77 375.64 A: once you once you accept the fact that you don't have control 

375.75 379.87 A: it everything becomes easier you you begin to see things for what they are 

380.01 384.84 B: [mn] yeah i yeah and and i think that's what i don't know i guess just seeing 

384.61 388.60 B: other people think they have control and realizing no hey you have don't have 

388.09 390.70 A: totally [laughter] 

388.42 400.25 B: control and then [laughter] you know it's like see that's what you had to go there to realize you know [laughter] but it's i don't i just enjoy watching this stuff and sometimes their drama is much better than mine so [laughter] 

392.81 393.86 A: right 

398.91 403.86 A: [laughter] well no it's the whole soap opera moment about it i'm sure 

400.34 401.62 B: (( i don't how quite )) 

403.09 416.91 B: e- exactly yeah it is 'cause it yeah i'm i'm new at staying at home and um i'm used to being in the workforce and i got to see my drama there you know [laughter] and and now being at home i pretty much work on my computer and [mn]
