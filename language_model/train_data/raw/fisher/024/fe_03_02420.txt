39.62 43.16 B: it to me it's ah it it's also about er er 

43.43 49.23 B: eating er food which is completely processed and devitalized because it's 

50.03 62.38 B: it's an addiction it's a bad habit and it makes people sick and it creates all sorts kinds of addiction like alcohol and smoking and ah drugs and all of that so ah 

62.49 67.91 B: the way we eat is really ah important it and can be a very bad habit 

68.10 74.34 B: when when we drink and like the sodas and ah it's a lot of ah food with pesticides and 

74.42 77.46 B: all of this will create lot of addictions 

79.13 84.18 A: that's that's a very interesting point i hadn't thought of it that way [laughter] 

83.64 90.85 B: well unfortunately we're so we don't know about that the food which is not ah the way ah 

91.46 99.03 B: spirit created it ah like the the animals in the wild they don't they never get sick and truly um 

93.44 94.02 A: (( [noise] )) 

99.52 106.28 B: when we see the the increase of this is now appearing it's really because of what is like in ah what it means 

106.47 110.97 B: and ah it it it goes from one addiction to another 

111.91 117.86 A: that's a very true point i guess i don't think a whole lot about what i eat [laughter] 

117.87 129.15 B: [laughter] well i notice ah in this study they are going to to consider but it's really [laughter] it's a for for example er sugar goes with salt ah 

129.28 141.49 B: and then it creates a different problems to eats a lot of sugar we create diabetes and if we increase the amount of salt and ah it can create a hydric pressure 

141.78 149.51 B: and then it's more processed food and [laughter] insulin and [laughter] all of that stuff [laughter] 

146.01 147.13 A: (( [noise] )) 

148.00 150.02 A: [laughter] 

150.98 152.67 A: yeah that

155.51 157.33 B: (( all right all right right )) 

158.09 162.76 A: it makes one think about what they're eating i guess [laughter] 

161.19 163.51 B: (( [laughter] mm )) 

163.28 171.30 A: well i think the problem with smoking that i see is the fact that you're not only harming yourself you're harming everyone around you 

170.89 172.35 B: i agree with you 

172.07 177.81 A: you know you're if you're smoking a cigarette you know they've got the commercials out and studies show that 

177.96 181.80 A: that the people around you get more of the nicotine and more of the bad 

181.54 182.76 B: right right 

181.89 184.63 A: bad things than you are more of the bad 

184.86 188.39 A: things than you do [laughter] 

186.57 190.20 B: right right right it's agree with you [laughter] 

189.50 192.79 A: so i'm like just you know eating 

193.03 200.33 A: and putting all the chemicals into your own body or drinking and putting all the chemicals in your own body you're putting them in everybody elses 

197.89 198.74 B: mhm 

200.13 201.36 B: (( mm mm )) 

200.63 202.72 A: (( whether they chose to or not )) 

202.50 205.37 B: right even though it's sad to smoke 

205.66 207.07 B: (( oh yeah )) 

206.46 207.57 A: [laughter] 

207.26 214.21 B: [laughter] li- like i ah i think i was in the park and ah well for example when i go to green market 

214.47 227.28 B: there's beautiful benches and ah sometimes i will like to sit to snack something on something and um i have to look who is smoking there because when people smoke i don't want to be seated next to that person 

227.00 228.06 A: (( [noise] )) 

227.43 232.72 B: (( and even with they don't realise how the the smoke is annoying )) 

233.94 245.54 A: yes that i mean if people need to smoke they could at least make sure that they're not around anyone else which is really tough [laughter] i mean i guess you they would maybe think that they're outside but 

241.57 243.78 B: right right 

245.51 251.88 A: if the wind is blowing right and it goes in your face or whatever and a lot of people have allergies to smoke 

245.53 246.42 B: right 

248.25 249.52 B: right 

251.27 253.43 B: right it's true it's true 

253.52 254.57 B: i agree with 

255.87 263.81 B: you that ah funny and what what er is funny for me is i see this addiction in winter time for example people work in office 

263.83 267.30 B: they go outside to to freeze 

267.78 272.29 B: outside just to smoke it's unbelievable [laughter] 

269.44 270.40 A: [laughter] 

270.99 278.54 A: [laughter] yeah they probably wouldn't stand outside for that long waiting for a cab or something like that but if they're smoking that's [laughter] 

276.04 276.76 B: right 

277.65 288.24 B: r- right ah it's always ah it's it's it's am it's amazing to see that [laughter] the thing which um really i don't like to see is ah when the 

283.17 284.33 A: [laughter] 

288.28 295.71 B: um people are in the car with children and they smoke in the car i don't understand why they can do that to their children 

291.04 292.31 A: mhm 

295.32 297.91 A: i agree totally or a pregnant woman 

297.53 298.77 B: yes they 

298.00 302.45 A: you know all those studies that show what it does to the child and 

302.73 310.63 A: and they i don't i have never heard of any studies about addiction with children but i mean you see studies with addiction with alcoholism 

310.41 312.10 B: right right 

311.40 321.72 A: so maybe that's why there's an increase in there was an increase in teenage smoking is because the parents all smoked when they were pregnant and didn't think anything of it [laughter] 

321.39 329.61 B: right w- well i guess it's a combination of things because the commercials it's interesting on t._v. er why i don't have it 

329.86 332.67 B: they they have higher now 

332.88 335.20 B: childrens psychological 

335.61 347.20 B: ah to make a balance er buy things for the kids and are so that they know that the kids are going to ask for it and it was same for teenagers i believe they see the smoking 

347.27 353.84 B: ah at the advertising they think is great ah it's so exciting it's empowering and all that stuff 

353.95 355.48 B: and um 

355.52 361.48 B: it's ah the way they they are able to manipulate the teenager as well 

361.68 364.23 B: to have them addicted 

364.87 368.51 B: and then what is interesting too in in ah every commercial 

365.03 365.71 A: (( mm )) 

368.55 372.31 B: it's one thing after another it's one addiction with another one 

372.41 375.41 B: (( it's the it's the way it is ah made )) 

374.98 381.06 A: mhm most of the time when you see someone smoking they're drinking or vice versa if somebody is drinking 

381.24 389.79 A: you know i have a friend who smokes who says that whenever he drinks a beer he needs to have a cigarette [laughter] it's kind of to balance it out [laughter] [laughter] 

385.94 387.97 B: right right right 

388.71 402.57 B: right and ah even ah when ah y- you go outside on the billboards you see these pictures of people er together on the beach having fun with a drink it's always ah showing people it's 

402.58 411.79 B: very powering you're so beautiful and you can be friends or you can make a lot of friends when you ah drink and when you smoke it's 

412.37 420.42 B: i- it's interesting and then we have this it's not good for your health blah blah blah and at the meantime they push really people but they 

420.53 426.94 B: if you don't do that you're not going to look good you're not going to look great and be wonderful [laughter] 

426.20 429.72 A: mhm it's funny how society 

429.73 439.59 A: looks down on people that wh- who don't drink in a lot of cases you know if you go out with friends or whatever and you don't drink you're looked down on 

431.38 432.02 B: (( mm mm )) 

439.26 440.32 B: right 

440.15 445.36 A: like well you know well why not what's wrong with you that you don't drink alcohol [laughter] 

444.55 449.11 B: right you know it's amazing because i don't like alcohol and i don't drink it at all 

449.13 460.69 B: and people say how come you're french and you don't drink alcohol i say i don't like it it's not because i'm french but i'm supposed to like it [laughter] it's so interesting [laughter] 

456.15 459.07 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

460.35 464.74 A: yeah it's it really doesn't taste that good [laughter] i mean [noise] 

463.46 473.23 B: it it doesn't taste good i never i remember when i ah was a teenager of course i tasted it and at first i didn't really like it um 

473.23 480.26 B: i i did it when i was going to dance with friends and stuff like that but it was not really 

480.50 482.83 B: something i i enjoyed anyway 

482.70 484.30 A: mhm [laughter] 

483.57 486.95 B: i i don't know what people find in alcohol er 

487.25 488.64 B: when ah 

488.68 495.61 B: they drink it i r- really i don't know even if they are not alcoholic and they drink it on occasion i don't know what's 

495.81 497.31 B: what is nice 

497.96 507.68 A: yeah i [laughter] i guess it's just the the fact of it and how society has glamorized it how it's been glamorized throughout 

507.88 509.79 A: throughout the ages 

509.88 517.76 A: and and in america it's the fact that it's illegal for children or for you know anyone under twenty one 

517.56 518.98 B: right right right 

518.07 520.00 A: and that's i think that's a 

520.17 525.17 A: big big part of the desire to drink [laughter] 

524.13 533.68 B: mhm right it's true that ah when ah you are a teenager you want to experiment because they see people doing it it's like a a child ah who is growing 

533.62 541.52 B: a child won't understand when we say it's not good for you and he sees his parents or other people do it it's it's very confusing 

541.41 542.62 A: mhm 

542.01 549.94 B: so and the teenagers okay ah ah it's the time to experiment to discover who they are and they want to experiment everything 

549.82 558.40 A: mhm and because they can't do it they think it's better [laughter] because only adults can do it they think that they're adults so they can do it [laughter] 

553.50 554.85 B: right right 

555.91 559.95 B: r- right it is true it it's true [laughter] 

559.22 563.81 A: and that's what leads to the alcoholism and the bad habits and the [laughter] 

562.72 563.56 B: (( right )) 

563.58 568.54 B: because i'm amazed to see that with with thing about alcohol is for example 

568.51 580.37 B: (( and also sodas are really addictive too it's like alcohol and it depletes the body of different things ah that people are not aware of it's a very dangerous to you )) 

580.37 583.83 B: and it's more than choice when there is aspartame in it 

583.87 591.69 B: ah because aspartame has ah side effects and bad effects wh- which take a long time to show up 

587.87 589.22 A: mhm 

591.53 592.70 A: yeah 

591.74 595.71 B: a- and um the the sodas are very addictive and they 

596.15 599.89 B: (( they do act l- like they deplete the body out of it's it's k- ))
