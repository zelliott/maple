72.67 75.40 A: well hey i'd be surprised at that too 

74.82 79.56 B: they had to make each of each of 'em had to make themselves seem better than the next you know 

79.44 80.36 A: mm 

80.74 93.11 A: hm well i don't really watch a whole lot of television but my kids from time to time have it on some of these shows i did watch i have to admit i did watch joe millionaire because i wanted to see the ending too and there's 

87.44 88.53 B: mhm 

92.13 93.46 B: mhm 

92.98 100.52 A: nothing that ticked me off more than when they prolonged it past the episode it looked like they were going to give the ending to oh what a waste 

97.56 99.00 B: yeah 

99.24 109.26 B: a- and you to wait another week for two hours of of you know fluff in the front and then and then he finally i guess told her at the end yeah that's the only one i watched 

102.41 103.48 A: yeah 

107.17 108.53 A: yeah well 

108.68 118.69 A: well the backlash for me is i'm not going to bother watching the [laughter] the next one like that oh you know what there is one that i saw just a- an episode or two of that i thought was 

111.79 112.83 B: yeah i 

118.77 122.35 A: really funny and that's the one uh mm [lipsmack] 

122.40 131.87 A: it's the dating one where like three for your for your kids or something and um like your daughter or your son and the parents choose 

130.45 132.43 B: oh meet the parents 

132.26 133.83 A: meet the parents 

133.06 137.16 B: yeah oh you know what now that you say that i've watched that too just off and on 

136.81 147.36 A: i thought that w- i watched it i think i've watched it like three times and i just thought that was funnier than all get out and a part of me felt sorry for them the other part of me felt like well you know 

141.33 142.71 B: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

147.63 151.63 A: you're learning that it doesn't pay to lie [laughter] [laughter] 

149.67 152.48 B: mhm well i i liked 

151.66 155.79 A: because those lie detectors would kill 'em in the end [laughter] 

153.27 154.55 B: yeah 

154.99 163.51 B: i liked that but i i after i saw a couple of shows it was like after the lie detector tests and this and that you know as far as 

162.17 164.30 A: then it lost its uniqueness 

163.67 174.16 B: yeah as far as some of the stuff that the couples had done that the parents were watching on video and stuff like that like out at the jacuzzi or in the pool it takes two to tango 

172.08 172.99 A: uh-huh 

173.84 174.96 A: oh yeah 

174.14 179.90 B: you know and you're putting some woman or a man on a lie detector test everybody's got a past 

179.17 180.38 A: yeah 

179.78 192.35 B: um no one's perfect we've all done things we're not proud of and these th- they're making their decisions on these women based on you know how many people they've slept with how many drinks they have when they go out and you know stuff 

183.30 184.37 A: yeah 

192.26 194.90 B: i'm sure the son doesn't really care [laughter] 

192.36 193.94 A: i think you know the biggest 

194.27 198.70 A: well i think the biggest eye opener to the parents was that their kids are 

198.84 200.60 A: are real adults 

199.97 202.35 B: yeah they are the way they are 

200.74 212.28 A: that was a that wa- yeah and it you know it you you're surprised that your kids would fall into that class and do some of that stuff but they're they're just human beings like everybody else 

207.86 209.64 B: yeah exactly 

211.72 221.09 B: i have a nineteen year old daughter and i always i'd had said to her look when you start having sex with your boyfriend please come to me first don't do it first come to me first so we can discuss it 

221.37 228.31 B: do the planned parenthood thing or you know do what we have to do and she actually did and it was like oh my god i can't believe she's doing this [laughter] 

227.99 230.19 A: [laughter] 

228.47 230.76 B: (( it's like oh jeez )) 

230.43 239.62 A: well you know it's not a bad thing i have a twenty one year old daughter and when i dropped her off at college 'cause she kept saying no no no i don't wanna to talk to you about it and i've always been pretty open about 

239.47 246.54 A: about um sex in general and we talk about it in our house actually and it embarrasses the kids to no end 

241.83 242.93 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

246.06 247.43 B: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

246.59 250.08 A: but i feel like unless you normalize it they won't 

249.39 250.64 B: yeah 

250.25 264.29 A: so uh wh- when i dropped my daughter off at college the number one on my checklist was figuring out where planned parenthood was and showing it to her so that if she doesn't feel comfortable coming to me at least she knew there was someplace else to go 

256.82 257.99 B: yeah 

263.36 272.24 B: yeah well we did the same thing we started going to planned parenthood but then it got into the where i didn't even have to go with her anymore she was sixteen 

272.18 284.84 B: and it was i would call to make her appointments and they're if if you're not shannon we can't talk to you what do you mean this is my daughter i'm being a responsible parent making an appointment for her so she has no babies and you're telling me i can't 

278.45 281.30 A: [laughter] 

285.04 286.13 A: yeah 

285.24 288.99 B: well she doesn't really even have to tell you i'm like what [laughter] 

288.33 298.51 A: wow wow well they did the same i mean once my i sent my daughter off to college because she went young so she was still not eighteen it didn't matter they won't share anything with you they 

297.70 305.88 B: no i was so surprised at that you would figure because you're trying to be a good parent and you know they didn't like me a little bit but [lipsmack] they're s- 

304.68 311.80 A: no they're afraid you're actually a really bad parent checking up on them and you're can be sweet as all get out and it won't they won't buy it [laughter] 

307.96 309.12 B: (( [mn] yeah [laughter] )) 

310.32 315.86 B: yeah 'cause i was like uh who do you think brings her to these appointments you know i sit in that waiting room and wait for her 

315.60 317.34 A: uh-huh [laughter] 

316.34 319.70 B: and now that she's nineteen i have you know i have nothing to do with it 

319.54 328.00 A: but you know the reverse of that that meet the parents thing w- was meet the kids did you see that one i think there was only one episode 

322.32 323.25 B: mhm 

325.10 326.40 B: no 

327.46 329.31 B: i never even heard of that 

328.68 336.09 A: yeah it was meet the kids and it was this uh uh single mom with three grown adult boys 

335.46 337.04 B: oh jeez 

336.32 346.52 A: yeah and then they brought in these three men which apparently they must have prescreened as matching in some way because they it was real clear from the early introduction that they'd already met 

346.04 347.20 B: mhm 

346.56 358.37 A: previously and um so i figure they must have done some prescreening to come up with these three jokers you know but um those boys were just ruthless 

353.10 354.21 B: (( [laughter] )) 

357.79 360.06 B: oh no oh yeah i bet 

359.55 372.21 A: oh they were just ruthless and what was really sad at the end is a mo- the mother was trying to use reverse psychology 'cause they were going to pick somebody who they didn't want their mom to get 'cause she she w- they were tired of seeing her date losers 

371.70 372.74 B: yeah 

372.49 383.15 A: and um on one of the elimination the very first elimination rounds the guy she felt most uh attached to she tried to do some reverse 

383.05 392.53 A: um psychology ah saying you know she didn't have a lot of interest in him thinking that well that's not someone mom would normally date so we should keep him 

392.07 393.05 B: mhm 

392.78 397.96 A: and instead the opposite happened they let him go first [laughter] 

394.65 396.25 B: oh no 

396.81 398.43 B: no way 

398.06 403.09 A: and then it was just two losers in my view that were left [laughter] [laughter] 

400.08 403.67 B: yeah [laughter] no i never heard that i never heard of that at all 

403.31 409.14 A: so it was it was it wasn't so much as a funny show as it was um and it it's all very very humorous 

409.32 413.39 A: there's definitely something humorous about putting a man on a hot seat and about 

412.48 417.03 B: yeah yeah watch him squirm [laughter] 

413.53 426.85 A: l- lying and finding some of those yeah because they brought in past girlfriends that were you know these men and they did show videos and they you know they told things that these guys had done like i guess one guy was an artist and apparently 

417.85 419.56 B: oh yeah 

426.94 434.33 A: someone had told uh some of you know and his friends someone had told that what he had done in a restaurant previously was um 

434.70 439.28 A: um picked up change from another table the waitress' tip to pay his own bill it's 

436.77 437.52 B: oh 

438.34 439.70 B: oh no 

439.34 442.39 A: like ew [laughter] but 

440.58 443.79 B: oh but something like that i mean you know 

442.73 447.75 A: those nasty little traits you really don't want anybody to know about [laughter] 

445.33 453.51 B: yeah yeah but it's not something that that it's you know it's not gonna affect you for the rest of your life if your daughter 

453.12 457.97 A: no but you know they they came up with the weirdest little things like that and it was just sort of an 

453.86 455.39 B: dates this man 

458.02 471.19 A: this just weird sinking feeling it's like you know i really don't want to know this stuff about these guys [laughter] [laughter] but you know what the only show i've really i watch you know one here and one there and it's like beyond that they just don't capture my 

461.94 464.20 B: that's yeah yeah 

470.53 471.25 B: y- 

471.14 473.39 A: imagination much 

472.50 477.71 B: well i'm sitting here the the other one i did watch me i oh i don't watch any and now they're coming up 

477.53 479.11 A: [laughter] 

477.82 480.52 B: big brother the very first big brother 

480.67 484.38 B: did you see that one when they put those like ten people in the house and 

482.30 488.57 A: no i only saw n- i only saw like news reports and clippings on it but i never actually watched any of it 

485.93 487.24 B: okay that was 

487.77 499.20 B: that was really good because it was the second one after the survivor so it was the next one but a different one other you know unlike survivor and that that was really good i liked that 

491.39 493.82 A: oh 

498.16 499.90 A: oh interesting 

500.03 504.37 A: there's just no way i'd be chained in a house with a bunch of strangers like that 

504.28 514.29 B: ah i- i don't know you know what i li- i like the extreme makeover show i went online last night and tried to get an application it's twelve pages long 

513.87 515.36 A: oh you're kidding me 

514.45 522.72 B: the application it's so much writing and videos and pictures you have to send but i guess if you really wanna do it you're gonna do it but 

521.76 529.12 A: oh isn't that isn't that truly an extreme show i mean don't they do like liposuction and facelifts and all kind of stuff 

524.32 525.62 B: oh my 

526.44 529.58 B: mhm yeah yeah 

529.67 531.17 A: oh

531.87 535.87 A: yeah i saw the commercials and i just kinda went ooh 

534.59 539.49 B: can you imagine the money you're saving though i mean if you if you really wanted to do all those things 

537.93 540.21 A: for going on the show they pay for everything 

539.88 543.09 B: i believe so i don't think you pay a dime 

542.68 550.90 A: i think what i'd really hate is if they s- suggested that you they pick something [laughter] you don't want fixed oh wait a minute i thought that was one of my good features 

547.89 549.29 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

550.32 555.57 B: [laughter] we all have probably as far women we all have the same couple of things we want to fix
