74.08 77.12 B: (( [laughter] ))

93.94 94.87 A: yes 

98.23 105.90 A: yes that's the personal habits a question of personal habit ah becomes ah ah kind of social habits because

116.07 120.63 B: yes that's true that's true but um one you know the 

120.87 131.41 B: the thing that i i had experienced before is that i always had ah guests over for dinner and things like this at my home and ah and first i was tolerating ah smoke smoking 

131.49 139.86 B: and um and it was like i think that whenever you have like ten smokers together they tend to smoke more 

139.91 148.78 B: and i was really like you know i couldn't breath it anymore so after a while i said well you know could you just smoke outside and in i think that in you know in my country it's like ah 

148.94 155.31 B: well you know then you're not social if you don't al- allow the you know smokers to smoke in an evening or if you have guests 

155.36 156.58 B: and here 

156.36 169.20 B: i i realise that i have ah friends who smoke also in california you know french friends or things like this but they do ah they usually go outside on the patio to smoke and we have a great weather here so it's easier for

178.55 179.53 B: oh 

183.59 186.32 A: is sort of a by-product of of um 

186.26 198.73 A: you know i don't really exercise to exercise but exercise with the aim that it's it's ah you know it's going to result and [laughter] work a lot but it is so i guess you could make some r- relationship between habits and ah 

198.98 202.52 A: and and art which is a way of trying to 

202.95 205.28 A: ah ah ah break habits 

205.04 206.49 B: yeah yeah yeah

261.14 264.46 B: i have a hard time doing exercise and ah 

265.16 273.29 B: so you know i mean it's great i mean i i did some dance before um you know when i was younger ah but um i just ah 

273.33 275.46 B: that's wonderful that you're dancing it's ah 

275.50 279.69 B: so are you a a a classical ballet dancer or jazz or 

279.53 281.18 A: (( ah well ah ah )) 

281.15 292.42 A: ah those are what shall i call it i i wouldn't exactly call it bad habits but um [laughter] but i you know i've i've had some training in all those things but i you know i've i've had some training in all those things but i i guess the kind of dancing i do but let's not get off on that 

292.36 305.26 A: and um like i think we're supposed to um try to stay on [laughter] i'd love to talk about my dancing and i guess i could relate it to a habit but it's also ah in fact well actually actually the nature of practising 

305.36 309.53 A: ah which is you know a form of habit there's um um 

309.76 320.04 A: there is ah you know you you kind of practise 'til it becomes a habit when you become aware that you're doing habitual things you're practising to break habits and yet you're practising to develop habits 

316.43 317.05 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

319.82 325.41 A: i was interested in what you said about 'cause i think that's true about ah smokers smoke more when they're together 

325.47 332.36 A: ah do you think that's also true with these other possibilities they threw at us like overeaters and and 

331.30 333.86 B: (( right mhm ah yeah um well )) 

332.83 336.92 A: alcoholics do you you alcoholics do drink more if they get together right 

336.17 341.19 B: yeah that's right ah that's right i i ah i see when when i go to parties and people 

341.09 355.56 B: ah ah i mean i had experience in the past with ah with people that ah with like boyfriends that ah would drink more if you know we go to a party and there's like a lot of alcohol in there you know i- if the if there is an occasion people are going to drink or they're going to smoke you know 

355.78 362.14 B: ah i would not say the same thing for eating because i mean usually i would say that i eat more 

362.19 366.64 B: ah i have the bad habit to eat more when i'm alone than when i'm with around people yeah 

366.97 375.87 A: so and so we can't really generalize about habits in general each one th- that you know 'cause i i think you're i think right i think i eat more when i'm alone myself 

376.10 377.57 A: and um 

377.76 387.49 B: i think i think it's the i mean there's some people that have that would eat more if they go to a restaurant with friends you know that's where they tend to overeat but um 

387.53 397.69 B: for my personal experience it's i would eat more when i'm alone because i think that ah i i um i tend to compensate more ah food you know like ah 

392.13 396.07 A: (( yeah )) 

397.65 403.03 B: ah loneliness or boredom or whatever with food so i would do this when i'm alone 

403.04 405.26 B: and ah you know yeah 

405.61 412.00 A: that's that's another topic loneliness and habits and with restaurants that well i i i 

411.83 422.73 A: there's also the question of economics isn't there and i know that ah you know there's a certain feeling when you're you're paying for this food and you know it's sort of embarrassing to take home a doggie bag so i'm tempted to you know it's my you 

422.79 430.14 A: know finish it like that's that's another kind of habit training like you're you know you're parental training to you know eat what's on your plate 

430.15 436.37 A: whereas at home if you cook for yourself you know you could put it away and you know you can you know nobody sees if you throw it out 

436.27 444.14 B: yeah oh but i mean a- th- com- compared to um the habit we have ah in europe ah we don't have the habit to take a doggie bag 

443.54 444.90 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] i )) 

444.54 451.16 B: that's wonderful here because you don't have to finish your your plate you know you could just okay you know i'm i'm not going to finish that i'm going to just going take it home 

451.25 457.15 B: and ah you know but um yeah i would say that ah that's the the huge difference 

456.90 457.46 A: (( know )) 

457.64 471.50 A: oh that's right and europeans um um i think that the last time i was in europe was in ninety eight actually and ah um their habit does seem to be to always kind of leave something on the plate that may may may be the illusion of of plentitude which 

471.44 478.54 A: wasn't always the case i mean ah well it's never the case for everybody but even ah you know middle class europeans certainly suffered during the war 

478.46 479.33 B: yeah 

478.86 486.99 A: and um and i'm thrilled to think that you know we're free of that i i it's something i noticed with people you know leaving things behind on their plate almost um 

487.16 488.64 A: self-consciously 

488.64 493.86 B: yeah and and ah and ah i- if you take europe and not come here and ah 

493.85 501.73 B: and i mean the first time i came here and i ate and then the you know i didn't finish because i was the portions here are huge compared to what we have 

500.17 501.62 A: there's that too [laughter] 

501.60 515.44 B: we have over there and then the the the the the waiter said do you want a d- do you want a you know do you want to take this home and i was like excuse me [laughter] that's that's really a a different you now a huge difference of ah behaviour but ah 

501.67 502.56 A: yes 

515.69 516.92 B: (( you know just ah mm )) 

517.56 528.19 A: well back to smoking [mn] i i recall the same trip that i took in in ninety eight which was actually the last time i was in europe and um and already the anti-smoking 

528.24 540.08 A: um mania had a- forgive me 'cause you don't like smoke but um had taken over in this country so i was very discreet and said would you mind if i smoke it's just that well you know that sort of was just so comical that i would ask the question 

539.84 547.84 B: yeah yeah i think that the yeah i think it's ah but i mean i'm sure if you go like to ah um like the mid west or 

547.70 559.80 B: or or you know like ah texas or things like this i mean everybody smokes you know i mean the the ratio i think the ratio's like ah maybe in california eighty percent of people do not smoke and um 

559.69 565.15 B: twenty percent do smoke and if you go like in another even if you go to nevada to los vegas 

565.39 568.60 B: you know the ratio is reverse i mean there's a lot of people that are smoking there 

568.56 572.80 A: oh well that d- do can they smoke in gambling casinos do you suppose i've never been there 

572.21 580.99 B: oh yes you you you can you can smoke oh everywhere yeah when you go to casinos you have you have that oh huge smoke you know i mean yeah yeah of course i mean they would never 

580.34 583.49 A: it must be very stressful um you now winning and losing
