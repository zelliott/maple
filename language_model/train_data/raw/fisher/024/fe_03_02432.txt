15.54 16.62 A: mhm 

15.85 17.93 B: i i caught smoking 

18.14 27.04 A: okay um there was this is my second time doing this am i supposed to like did they like put me on the list twice or something 

23.91 25.26 B: [laughter] 

27.14 30.60 A: but um it's gossiping and 

30.95 32.23 A: um 

32.90 34.04 A: hm 

34.62 37.96 A: i think lack of exercising overeating 

35.32 36.35 B: (( i think it was )) 

37.66 40.46 B: oh i heard yeah i heard that one um 

41.30 43.33 B: okay well i know that 

43.65 46.48 B: a personal habit that i found annoying 

46.93 59.18 B: from from other people that i know is um smoking 'cause a lot of my friends and my sister smokes at least she smokes at least a pack a day and it's annoying because 

51.02 52.00 A: mhm 

59.60 60.84 B: she 

61.42 62.96 B: if she does it 

63.33 76.82 B: in the same room then it fills up the room with smoke and the smell and if she has to leave the room then it interrupts whatever we were doing like if we were talking or eating or watching a movie then 

76.10 77.11 A: mhm 

76.92 83.12 B: then like it's just really it's really anti-social kind of behaviour 

83.21 84.44 A: yeah 

85.15 87.29 B: i i i i don't 

85.18 86.08 A: (( ah )) 

87.41 94.35 B: i'm not against people smoking in public it's just that when it's somebody i personally know 

94.41 95.89 B: it can be annoying 

94.53 95.79 A: mhm 

97.27 111.38 A: yeah a lot of my friends smoke and okay and i guess they're used to other people not wanting them to smoke because every time that i say it's okay to smoke in my car they're just completely shocked they're like you're the nicest person on earth 

97.63 98.26 B: (( so )) 

110.68 111.83 B: [laughter] 

111.46 117.49 A: but you know like no matter how poor they are they always have money for an extra pack of cigarettes and that's why 

117.50 118.95 B: (( that's true [laughter] that's )) 

117.65 125.85 A: the thing that causes them a lot of stress too like every time they can't find a cigarette i see how much they panic [laughter] it just sucks 

125.73 131.50 B: that's true i i know i've heard that one of the best ways to quit smoking is just to 

131.80 139.24 B: have a jar and put all the money that you would have spent on a pack of cigarettes in the jar and at the end of one month just see how much you've saved 

139.53 141.86 B: and buy something nice with it 

142.21 145.13 A: [laughter] oh my gosh 

143.26 144.21 B: so [laughter] 

144.90 146.32 B: (( i it's )) 

146.40 151.59 B: it's expensive and it all it does is shorten your life i guess 

152.63 153.50 B: but 

152.84 154.11 A: i agree 

154.49 158.54 B: um i guess the other pet peeve [laughter] that i have 

158.61 159.82 B: um 

159.99 161.55 B: is when people 

162.28 163.50 B: gossip 

163.64 176.23 A: yeah oh my god that's like the biggest thing i went to an all girls high school and everybody gossiped to everybody i just hated it i just never went to school i just even the teachers would gossip 

165.17 166.02 B: [laughter] 

168.19 169.42 B: oh 

176.22 181.36 A: and so like i personally have been affected more by gossiping than smoking 

181.25 183.22 B: ah [laughter] [laughter] 

181.40 186.27 A: [laughter] but then it's like i gossip too it's so fun when i gossip 

185.87 188.27 B: well that's true i you [laughter] 

186.28 188.62 A: so it's like i can't speak that [laughter] 

188.48 190.69 B: well i i know that i 

190.77 199.57 B: i get annoyed when people do it to be malicious but i think it's okay if you're in the middle of a conversation and or 

193.72 194.86 A: mhm 

200.31 207.85 B: or like you're you're two friends and you're just having a good time and you're and it's a big joke i think it's okay 

207.72 208.73 A: mhm 

208.40 213.43 B: but when you're doing it to i don't know to ruin somebody's reputation 

213.98 216.09 B: then that's when it's a problem 

216.04 217.34 A: yeah 

216.61 217.58 B: yes 

218.40 220.57 A: i guess gossiping i mean 

221.21 224.65 A: gossiping sounds bad but then it's not like you're 

224.99 226.91 A: i don't know like 

225.91 233.09 B: i think it's ha- i i find it hard to tell what's gossip and what's just like so this is what happened in my day 

232.45 240.55 A: yeah like this person got pregnant or look this person got into stanford or something like is that gossiping i guess it is like 

236.92 238.07 B: (( yeah )) 

239.59 240.75 B: um 

240.86 252.76 B: i don't i don't know well i think it depends on what intentions you have if you if you don't if you're not really concerned about the person like if you say well well this person 

245.56 246.56 A: uh-huh 

253.00 259.29 B: something family member passed away and blah blah blah and you're doing it just because you have genuine concern 

259.42 260.43 A: mhm 

259.60 263.64 B: or you're doing it because you want to sound like 

264.40 270.33 B: um are you you just doing it to get the word around i think that's gossip 

270.80 272.03 A: yeah 

271.80 276.52 B: but that doesn't i i guess gossip in general isn't always bad 

276.74 281.66 A: yeah do you think girls definitely gossip more than guys or are equal 

281.66 282.86 B: um 

282.87 283.96 B: i think it 

284.26 288.32 B: i think it's equal but it's completely different 

288.53 296.09 B: topics types of gossip and i think what people generally consider is gossip is what girls talk about 

289.65 291.16 A: mhm 

296.01 297.68 A: yeah [laughter] 

297.25 300.45 B: [laughter] but i know guys that they're like um 

300.93 310.71 B: well they'll talk about about their like lovelife or something with other guys and or they'll talk about girls that they know or um 

306.06 307.15 A: mhm 

310.80 313.77 B: or like work what's happening at work 

314.28 316.37 B: which is gossip i guess 

316.59 318.12 A: yeah 

317.04 318.13 B: (( yeah )) 

318.23 319.34 B: um 

320.09 322.06 B: i know in my high school 

322.29 323.33 B: there is 

324.73 326.44 B: the everybody who 

326.93 332.26 B: knew or made a point to like know what was going on especially it 

332.33 337.01 B: was like the more popular people the more popular crowd 

336.11 337.55 A: [laughter] 

337.77 339.48 B: so i guess 

338.23 339.46 A: yeah 

339.67 350.36 B: i guess it was kind of it was kind of frustrating especially if if you didn't mean for it to happen like you told somebody who you told not to tell anybody else 

350.47 351.75 A: yeah 

350.56 352.67 B: and of course that never works 

353.16 357.69 A: i think like one of my friendships was ruined by my 

357.57 368.22 A: gossiping but i have no clue like i know i gossiped about her but but she also didn't have that many friends so she was always like hanging around me but everybody would gossip and i'd chime in too 

368.06 373.25 A: and like after high school we lost touch but i know she moved to paris 

373.27 380.28 A: and i was going to visit there this year so i called her just like three weeks ago just to ask her like you know 

380.56 388.73 A: visit and maybe teach me some french and i thought she'd be delighted to hear from me and she like practically hung up on me [laughter] yeah it was like oh god 

387.54 389.94 B: mm oh [laughter] is it because of what happened 

389.08 391.25 A: it must be my gossiping 

390.98 393.78 B: [laughter] well i mean was it 

393.87 397.04 B: stuff that was bad about her or just general 

397.15 400.87 A: yeah everybody had something bad to say about he like 

397.33 398.89 B: (( general information )) 

400.68 414.02 A: not about her style but just about the way she was she really kept to herself was always pissed off and i guess that was just not acceptable and you know everybody was all cheery and she was the only one who's like gloomy 

411.86 413.12 B: (( oh right )) 

414.22 415.44 A: so 

414.43 420.25 B: well yeah i can see well what do you think well would it be okay if 

415.57 416.60 A: yeah 

420.84 422.15 B: if like 

422.22 428.61 B: is there a difference between when you're talking about something that's personal that happened to that person 

428.48 431.14 B: or you're talking about like 

430.99 445.02 B: things that you notice about them like say well is there a difference if you were going to say well this person got pregnant because she slept around a lot and or is she like got into an accident because she was drunk driving or something 

445.08 447.43 B: or if you were saying something like 

447.68 448.83 B: well 

449.84 457.96 B: well whenever she passes by like she always gives me a stare or something or or like you know he's smelly or whatever 

454.09 455.10 A: [laughter] 

458.50 459.60 A: i to- 

458.63 459.46 B: i think 

459.96 460.88 B: (( i'm sorry )) 

460.30 462.38 A: um the personal stuff is 

462.99 466.58 A: i think the personal stuff is more gossipy like 

466.62 468.22 A: i know that with her 

468.00 482.93 A: just anything that was going on her in her life like people were curious about 'cause she would ignore people and so like whatever things she told me i would just let it spread like oh my god she kissed a guy at a bar or [laughter] something like that's totally gossip 

479.59 480.98 B: [laughter] 

483.32 488.04 A: gosh i wish i mean i tried to confront her about it i was like 

488.05 496.30 A: can you tell me why you're avoiding me and she was like well after high school i just really don't need to talk to you [laughter] and she hung up so i really think it was my gossipiness 

496.60 498.75 B: oh it could be better it could be that 

498.76 502.78 B: i don't know maybe her personality she just 

503.30 506.38 B: i don't know she didn't want to keep in contact or be bothered or 

507.43 520.44 A: yeah you would think everybody needs to be bothered some time like it's really difficult for her to make friends or at least from what i've seen so i thought you know even like a distant friend would be appreciated friend 

520.54 522.24 B: yeah i i 

522.37 529.27 B: definitely know what you mean because i have some friends who who just like are horrible at keeping in touch 

529.20 539.41 B: and it's cool because especially when you're people who travel a lot and you call them and you want to visit or you want to or if they visit they could stop by and stay at your place or something like that 

538.75 540.17 A: yeah 

540.43 542.34 B: so and i mean ah 

544.24 546.94 B: especially when you're not going to see that person 

546.98 552.49 B: what could you possibly have to dislike about them like if you don't see them that often 

552.18 554.18 A: yeah that's true 

554.22 561.82 B: like it's not like she is your friend like sitting at home thinking about how much she hates you or how much 

560.84 567.80 A: [laughter] yeah that's true it just somehow managed to linger i don't get it how about 

567.97 569.39 A: exercise 

569.58 570.71 B: [laughter] 

569.63 572.23 A: what are your views on exercise 

571.58 576.18 B: [laughter] um i have i go through stages like 

576.07 587.04 B: especially during the summer i get really hyped up and i go jogging and i do sport and then the winter when it's really cold and crappy out i hate i hate the cold weather 

587.34 591.39 A: mhm yeah oh um are you like in the east coast 

587.64 589.21 B: (( so i tend to like )) 

591.45 592.50 B: (( yes )) 

592.65 595.03 A: oh i'm on the west coast where it's 

594.43 596.92 B: oh that's a little different 

597.05 599.95 A: yeah but i never work out i think the more
