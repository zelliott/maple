49.39 50.64 B: not at once mind you 

50.45 54.65 A: oh that's always a good thing but it is yeah it is it is definitely hard um 

55.08 59.14 A: and we had a lot of we had twenty centimeters or what ten inches i guess whatever 

58.74 61.10 B: oh no you can you can use metric here 

60.37 64.57 A: oh thank you so i guess um 

65.04 69.64 A: how do we how do i keep healthy in this weather well it gets dark by five o'clock so 

69.47 69.85 B: hm 

70.02 73.72 A: essentially in the winter time just making an effort to go outside and 

74.49 75.91 A: taking vitamins and 

76.75 78.68 A: eating my eating vegetables and 

79.16 80.86 B: i tend to drink a lot of orange juice 

81.75 82.36 A: oh do you 

81.84 84.19 B: i don't know whether it's strictly psychological or 

84.83 89.05 B: you know because it doesn't really have all that much all that much vitamin c. compared to 

89.64 92.94 B: you know if i were to take a thousand milligrams of vitamin c. in pill form 

93.95 97.29 B: i would have to literally drink you know drink a hundred gallons of 

98.01 101.27 B: orange juice but i like the stuff and i think that is part of it i don't get 

102.15 105.48 B: so depressed so even if i do get sick i tend to shrug it off 

105.69 106.30 A: oh do you 

106.85 108.40 A: do you get sick a lot uh 

108.49 113.25 B: no no i don't i like i was saying sometimes i you know i'll get a cold for a day or two 

108.53 109.53 A: during the winter (( there )) 

114.82 119.25 A: yeah i don't find that i get very ill either but i think it (( )) you know (( )) 

119.72 122.04 A: if you work in an office just making sure that you 

122.72 124.18 A: clean your hands you know like 

124.56 125.30 B: ah i see 

124.74 126.15 A: basic germ prevention 

126.46 129.84 B: see i work in drug stores i i'm doing inventories of drug stores 

130.29 134.75 B: and that means i have to be in the cough and cold isle a lot and it's often full of sick people 

134.97 136.16 A: oh i bet it is yeah 

136.81 139.21 A: so you use that kind of you know like the 

139.60 142.02 A: those disinfectants for your hands and what not 

142.46 143.58 B: straight soap and water 

143.70 144.14 A: (( )) 

143.95 144.75 B: does just fine 

144.97 146.86 A: yeah that is what i use too and i find 

147.28 149.56 A: i think that that makes a big difference is just 

154.49 156.90 A: i don't get very sick i mean i'm really not very often 

159.06 159.72 A: but uh 

163.14 167.06 A: is is this thing supposed to like prompt us with questions or h- this is my first time 

166.03 169.25 B: oh no it does- it doesn't this is actually my second one we are going to ta- 

168.63 169.38 A: oh is it 

169.72 173.43 B: we're we're basically expected to converse for ten minutes and at the end of it it will 

173.92 175.86 B: tell us to wrap up and say goodbyes 

175.98 177.18 A: okay good i wasn't 

176.77 177.89 B: it's kind of neat really 

178.27 183.98 A: yeah i wasn't sure how it works so i (( )) thought is it going to like um you know mediate and ask questions or 

183.50 186.24 B: oh no just at the end it'll say (( )) (( you know you're )) 

186.37 189.90 B: you are you have got thirty seconds left to say goodbye and wrap up or whatever 

190.10 198.54 A: oh okay good so i (( )) well thank you for filling me in on it i really wasn't sure how it works so i guess we're supposed to keep talking then about 

194.25 194.83 B: oh sure 

199.03 200.10 A: keeping well and 

200.44 204.09 B: what do you what you do think of that statement it made about a cold lasting a week 

200.49 201.36 A: in the winter time 

204.67 207.33 B: if you don't go to the doctor and seven days if you do 

208.87 209.29 A: oh 

210.11 210.86 A: that it lasts 

211.17 212.77 A: the cold lasting a week if it 

212.64 215.41 B: it lasts exactly the same it says you know regardless 

214.67 215.93 A: oh i think it is true 

216.14 219.84 B: i think i think so too i mean all you can really do is treat symptoms 

219.97 220.66 A: exactly 

220.84 221.22 B: see 

221.52 225.61 B: something that that i've got a little bit of biology background something that i've learned 

226.58 227.20 B: is that 

227.66 230.43 B: we come in contact with a lot of infectious disease 

230.65 231.78 B: on a daily basis 

232.56 233.94 B: and the reason 

234.13 234.78 B: why 

235.61 241.15 B: for the most part people in the united states and canada you know and germany and england and what not 

241.62 243.32 B: tend not to die of these things 

244.24 245.00 B: um 

245.17 249.14 B: is that we have a generally higher level of health especially nutrition 

250.41 255.74 B: uh you know than most of the rest of the world if you look at the people who do get affected they tend to be elderly 

256.29 259.99 B: or babies or people living uh you know in poverty 

260.81 262.92 B: uh who don't have access to these things 

264.44 268.03 A: well i p- (( access )) proper nutrition for sure but i mean even within like 

268.85 273.35 A: you know in north american society you have people who can afford in the winter time to buy their 

273.88 276.17 A: fruits and their vegetables and things like this and 

276.96 279.79 A: on the other end of the spectrum you have people who can only eat (( kraft )) dinner 

280.24 284.68 B: uh pretty much yeah uh (( )) you know but the thing is even even if you can only 

285.42 290.39 B: eat kraft dinner i've i've been in that position myself both as a student and both you know 

291.26 293.43 B: between you know being between jobs 

294.02 294.54 B: uh 

294.67 298.63 B: assuming you can cook at all you can usually stay well veg- you know well 

299.07 300.39 B: supplied with vegetables 

301.41 304.38 B: uh you know you might not be able to get some of the more uh 

305.47 306.40 B: uh 

306.81 310.65 B: fancy eh stuff but you know you will certainly be able to get enough onions and 

311.28 312.76 B: broccoli and uh 

313.16 313.43 B: (( )) 

314.61 317.20 A: mhm i th- i think that is true but i you know 

317.60 323.58 A: i wonder then if it is a matter of education because i find that a lot of the time they are not buying the produce and things like that so 

323.42 327.84 B: well it a lot of it is is that and a lot of it is also cultural um 

328.34 330.07 B: a lot of people have grown up 

330.18 331.44 B: in families where 

332.15 332.89 B: um 

333.95 335.92 B: basically only only uh 

336.31 336.80 B: uh 

337.91 343.93 B: uh only comfort foods and only uh what's the word i am thinking of convenience foods were used 

344.76 348.59 B: and so they lack you know i mean if you hand them the can of spinach they go 

348.95 351.39 B: uh y- y- you know okay how do i turn this into food 

351.61 351.89 A: right 

352.49 353.14 B: um 

353.20 353.56 A: true 

353.96 356.76 B: oh you know similarly i mean i i had roommates 

357.50 358.42 B: who 

359.20 362.41 B: uh you know when i was in college i lived with a fellow who was a (( sikh )) 

363.20 365.28 B: uh for example and he would go out 

366.03 369.19 B: and uh purchase literally you know 

369.36 372.25 B: three or four dollars worth of food to eat for five days 

372.76 373.10 A: really 

373.36 378.04 B: and you know and you know he would come back with beans and rice and sauces and 

378.83 379.25 B: you know 

380.29 381.87 B: and and produce very 

382.06 384.58 B: good tasting food you know chic peas or 

386.68 389.67 B: you know uh or or various kinds of beans and 

390.34 391.62 B: and heavy sauces 

392.59 395.75 B: that were perfectly uh you know perfectly nutritious 

396.62 398.24 B: but not things that most people 

399.21 402.45 B: uh you know would produce for themselves to eat uh 

404.72 407.71 B: you know als- also of course you know we have uh 

408.99 409.61 B: uh 

409.75 413.71 B: you know a very a- a- again it's a very cultural thing that there are certain things that people 

414.46 416.64 B: don't associate with uh 

417.97 421.19 B: with food uh a a good example is plantains 

421.67 422.83 B: you know which are which are 

422.94 424.13 B: incredibly cheap 

425.13 427.19 A: i have to admit i never eat those 

425.21 425.54 B: uh 

427.46 428.11 B: well 

427.58 428.93 A: i don't know what to do with them really 

429.32 429.78 B: well 

429.94 432.60 B: they're s- they are basically a starch you can uh 

432.74 440.60 B: use them the same way you would use potatoes when they are unripe and when they are ripe which is when they get soft and and start (( taking )) up black spots 

440.97 443.70 B: they are ripe at the point where you would throw a banana out 

444.37 447.75 B: which is part of what people have trouble with with plantains 

448.03 449.25 B: uh but you can uh 

450.13 454.26 B: when they are ripe most of the starch in them has been converted to sugar by the bacteria 

455.45 455.94 B: in them 

456.20 457.56 B: and they are very sweet 

458.05 459.15 B: uh prior to that 

459.89 461.31 B: they are very uh 

461.80 464.12 B: neutral kind of like eating a raw potato 

464.10 464.61 A: really 

464.96 465.66 B: um but you 

465.12 466.62 A: so what how do you cook them then 

466.82 469.12 B: well you can bake them you can fry them 

469.98 470.66 B: uh 

470.81 473.14 B: i like to take one that's you know that is ripe 

473.93 478.15 B: and put it in some tinfoil with a little bit of jam or jelly or something like that 

479.18 482.47 B: and uh you cook it for about twenty twenty five minutes like that 

483.10 485.77 B: and it's tasty it's you know it's a it's a nice dessert 

486.09 493.11 A: i don't think we come by plantains very easily up here though i i don't think it is something that i normally see in the supermarket 

489.05 490.34 B: no no that is true 

492.79 494.61 B: something that you would find in canada 

494.96 498.56 B: see you know that is interesting because i don't know much about canadian produce 

499.29 499.96 B: um 

500.31 503.44 B: i mean you grow basically everything that we grow as far as i know 

503.67 504.11 A: true 

504.80 508.74 B: the uh i mean you know the equivalent uh i suppose would be uh 

509.17 510.84 B: doing the same thing with bananas 

510.97 511.47 A: yeah 

512.01 516.28 B: uh which also of course you have seen banana chips well you can also make plantain chips 

516.12 516.95 A: yeah yeah 

517.51 521.42 B: uh you can curry plantains you know you can do just about anything with it 

521.98 526.29 B: uh you know potatoes people tend to think of potatoes as either french fried or baked 

527.47 530.72 B: um but of course there are all sorts of things that you know you can do with them 

531.44 533.45 B: carrots yams you know 

534.26 535.66 A: i think you are right but i think that 

536.82 538.57 A: they've learned you know from their parents 

538.70 540.12 A: they they don't know what to do 

540.36 542.34 A: (( fruits )) how to even cook them you know (( )) 

542.50 544.86 B: oh of course i mean if if you give somebody 

545.06 545.57 B: you know 

546.31 547.65 B: a raw avocado 

548.88 549.59 B: you know it just 

550.21 551.32 B: this green lumpy thing
