113.04 113.89 A: oh yeah 

114.71 116.73 B: when he's sick he's definitely 

116.85 120.42 B: bundles up even when it's really hot outside at this past summer 

120.76 124.46 B: i live maryland and we had a really hot summer and we don't have air conditioning and 

124.70 125.08 A: mhm

125.45 127.70 B: bundled in his sweatshirt and sweat pants 

127.94 129.34 B: under a down comforter 

129.53 132.31 B: well i know he's sick when he goes to 

131.00 131.49 A: right 

132.43 135.79 B: to that extreme and he doesn't typically treat himself either 

135.66 136.46 A: right 

136.01 137.21 B: just let it run its course 

137.70 138.38 A: yeah 

139.18 140.71 A: definitely like sweating it out 

140.92 144.06 B: but i definitely think the vitamin c. route is the way to go with lots of fruits 

145.08 146.06 B: and things like that 

146.91 147.94 A: mine is (( )) 

148.27 152.06 A: he couldn't have been wrong about vitamin c. well i guess he could of been but he doesn't seem to be 

152.25 153.18 B: no i think so 

153.67 155.09 A: my wife tell me it's voodoo 

155.60 156.49 B: oh yeah 

155.78 156.51 A: it works 

157.42 160.94 A: she just saying that joking though and then she grudgingly take the vitamin c. when i give it to her 

161.01 163.15 B: so she does not take it or 

163.54 164.55 A: she does yeah yeah 

164.91 166.42 B: my sister takes echinacea 

166.58 167.20 A: oh really 

167.08 167.72 B: yeah she's 

168.04 168.87 B: more the herbal 

169.33 170.74 A: does she believe that works for her 

171.19 174.14 B: yeah she claims it does she even give it to her six year old 

174.47 178.50 A: i've tried it a few times and every once in awhile i take when i'm not feeling all that great 

178.92 179.18 A: but 

179.27 182.70 A: i just really feel like i have no idea whether it's actually doing anything 

182.49 185.83 B: right i think a lot of it is psychological too you never know 

185.16 185.52 A: yeah 

185.88 186.43 A: that's true 

186.71 188.53 B: and a lot of it is mind of over matter 

188.64 191.82 B: my mom was a nurse so we always had to be on our death for 

188.72 190.33 A: mhm mhm 

191.93 192.49 B: (( ))

245.12 245.60 A: nice 

245.78 246.40 B: yeah 

246.73 248.63 B: so is the two year old your only child 

249.07 250.71 A: yeah he's my first 

251.57 253.24 A: my only so far 

254.57 255.39 B: he's a hand full 

255.24 256.29 A: he's a joy 

256.29 257.11 B: yeah 

257.31 260.17 A: of course he helped me get sick last year too 

259.50 260.32 B: oh of course 

260.71 262.02 A: he because we've got a minute 

261.07 263.70 B: i'm a teacher which i bring home a lot of books 

263.81 264.09 B: from 

264.24 264.61 B: school 

264.72 268.39 A: right exactly we've got him in a day care center 

265.84 266.64 B: ah especially 

267.41 268.18 B: oh yeah 

268.64 274.32 A: the other parents and i were always joking about if how your know if one of them is sick we all get sick 

274.34 275.24 B: yeah that's true 

280.59 280.94 A: (( )) 

281.66 282.10 B: right 

282.55 284.00 A: well i've ah and little bit ah 

283.18 283.97 B: that's right 

284.92 286.85 A: whatever else 

286.06 287.51 B: it doesn't take much does it 

288.04 290.73 B: but you know ever child has to got through that whether he's 

288.13 288.80 A: but 

290.87 292.48 B: two or five beginning 

292.10 292.42 A: right 

292.60 292.98 B: school 

293.26 293.67 A: right 

293.43 296.05 B: because they are going to be exposed to other children and other bugs 

296.15 298.92 B: so at least he's building his immunity now at a younger age 

298.88 299.63 A: absolutely 

299.87 301.17 B: now it's probably a good thing 

301.34 302.10 A: absolutely 

302.44 304.82 A: i'm hoping he can avoid when i was a kid i was sick 

305.35 307.35 A: all the time i i was sick a lot 

307.57 307.96 B: were you 

307.88 309.62 A: i had a lot allergies and 

310.23 311.48 B: don't you still have allergies 

310.35 311.90 A: i missed a lot of school 

312.34 314.14 A: i do but they don't knock me out anymore 

315.27 319.12 A: they ever get really really bad i take like a little benadryl or something 

319.24 319.94 B: and that's good 

321.27 323.38 B: i heard claritin is going over the counter now 

323.69 324.12 A: is that right 

325.75 326.00 B: that's 

326.74 328.10 B: be a little more convenient to get it 

330.27 330.83 B: but ah 

332.86 335.62 B: i got sick a lot growing up too i had strep throat every year 

335.77 336.25 A: oh yeah 

335.77 338.42 B: and then finally when i was seventeen i got my tonsils out 

338.96 340.00 B: and that took care of it 

340.19 340.73 A: really 

340.72 341.22 B: mhm 

341.82 343.50 B: yeah i was old to get my tonsils out 

342.00 345.76 A: i had no idea there was even a relationship between strep throat and tonsils 

346.45 347.76 B: i didn't either until 

347.88 349.66 B: it happened to me but actually um 

349.78 354.07 B: one of my second graders just found this week that she's getting her tonsils out because she gets 

354.55 355.16 B: chronic 

355.26 355.55 B: throat 

355.67 356.23 A: mhm 

356.30 357.04 B: so it's just 

357.21 357.66 B: you know 

357.75 358.81 B: when have you had strep 

359.15 360.17 A: i have 

360.36 362.40 B: because you know how the get inflamed and all the red 

362.58 362.90 B: spots 

362.98 363.36 A: right 

363.07 363.36 B: and 

363.49 363.85 B: i guess 

364.12 366.23 B: if your tonsils are a little bit large 

366.68 367.32 B: larger than 

367.52 368.32 B: normal i guess 

368.57 368.92 A: right 

368.88 369.18 B: contributes 

369.35 370.86 B: to it or you're more prone to getting it 

371.54 372.56 B: yeah so that helps 

373.56 375.93 A: so you said one of my two year olds are you a teacher 

376.64 377.90 B: yeah one of my second graders 

377.99 378.36 A: uh-huh 

378.11 378.99 B: i am a teacher 

378.52 380.25 A: i mean to a second grader right that's what i 

379.39 379.81 B: mhm 

380.40 380.82 B: yeah 

380.82 381.64 A: that's what i meant to say 

381.00 381.34 B: yeah 

382.56 385.87 B: so that's what i was saying my first year i felt like i was sick all the time because 

385.72 386.03 A: uh-huh 

386.47 387.85 B: it's like your two year old is going through 

388.09 391.59 B: to day care for the first year you know it's just exposed to so many germs 

391.78 392.29 A: right 

393.80 394.05 B: going to have 

394.19 395.13 B: strong immunity now 

396.26 396.61 A: uh-huh 

397.17 400.20 B: because i don't really get sick anymore and the kids like you say you know 

398.63 399.30 A: oh really 

400.48 401.83 B: one kid brings it in 

401.64 402.14 A: right 

402.23 402.79 B: some parents 

403.49 403.82 B: aren't 

404.61 407.03 B: as considerate you know and they'll just send their kid to 

407.13 407.58 B: school with 

407.22 407.84 A: right yeah 

408.32 409.90 B: running noise and coughing 

411.38 413.62 A: i (( )) wondered about people who ah 

415.02 416.72 A: who work in hospitals 

416.89 417.40 B: mm 

417.02 417.48 A: you know 

417.57 418.11 B: mhm 

418.18 420.99 A: mean ah i use to have a job where i wound up 

421.53 424.70 A: ah going into hospitals just to some 

425.42 427.38 A: service work and ah 

427.91 436.21 A: you know i i i learned after a year of doing it to clean my hands contently and get out of the building as quickly as possible 

432.87 433.52 B: right 

435.00 436.88 B: it's true that's so important to 

436.75 440.16 A: and i thought you know how do people who work here everyday 

440.88 441.61 A: but i guess 

440.93 442.51 B: well i think it's the same idea you just 

442.61 443.84 B: build up your own immunity 

443.68 444.13 A: yeah 

444.30 446.76 A: eventually you've you've gotten exposed to everything and 

446.93 448.98 B: but you're right you have to be conscious about 

449.27 451.86 B: keeping your hands clean and not touching your face 

450.79 451.30 A: yeah 

453.01 453.92 B: yeah man it's just 

454.23 455.55 B: a matter of thinking it through 

458.27 459.66 B: so we got our christmas tree tonight

579.04 580.40 A: well another book that 

580.76 584.73 A: to me seemed like a children's book that i've heard so many adults talk about 

584.54 586.52 B: it really is enjoyable some people 

586.91 587.47 B: just don't

601.88 602.85 B: to see how the movie is
