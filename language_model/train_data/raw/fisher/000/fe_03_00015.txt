17.31 18.00 A: how about you 

18.09 18.81 B: balanced diet 

19.58 23.14 B: probably what i do indirectly otherwise i really 

21.40 22.02 A: huh-huh 

23.40 25.10 B: i really don't do much unless i 

25.28 26.21 B: feel it's coming on 

26.39 28.95 B: then i will really then i'll be more careful and take 

26.43 27.08 A: huh-huh 

29.40 31.37 B: extra vitamins or hum 

31.61 32.53 B: sometimes echinacea 

33.11 34.62 A: oh and does it seem to help 

35.23 38.23 B: echinacea i think does but i i'm not sure if 

38.66 41.52 B: i'm i'm honestly not sure if it's a lot of psychology 

41.43 42.38 A: mhm 

42.12 44.79 B: because it's just i convince myself that it's going to work 

44.47 45.27 A: yeah 

45.01 49.45 B: or you know i i mean it's possible that it actually does too so 

49.62 53.59 A: well yeah it could just activate whatever systems in our brain um 

54.22 55.03 A: kick in our 

55.12 56.38 A: immune system 

56.27 56.60 B: yeah 

56.82 57.07 B: yeah 

57.78 58.85 A: how do you tell 

59.20 59.52 B: yeah 

59.76 64.42 B: yeah i don't know but i really i'm knock on wood i haven't 

64.76 65.08 B: been 

65.26 66.08 B: sick much 

66.17 66.43 B: for 

66.68 68.86 B: any reason for a long time it seems 

69.09 71.03 A: hm um where do you live 

71.35 73.14 B: um i'm in ohio right now 

73.23 73.86 A: huh-huh 

73.43 75.04 B: columbus ohio where are you where do you live 

75.19 76.46 A: huh i'm in quebec 

77.22 77.99 B: oh in quebec 

78.15 78.66 A: yeah 

78.55 79.37 B: oh what part 

79.78 82.85 A: hum i'm halfway between montreal and quebec city 

84.38 87.25 B: so seasons are really drastic there to some extent 

87.18 92.81 A: yeah well summer's not as bad as summer is in ohio but ah winter is pretty rigorous 

93.97 94.38 A: but (( )) 

94.09 96.36 B: yeah i think geography plays a big role 

96.63 97.29 A: mhm 

97.20 98.75 B: because i know i i 

99.04 103.07 B: go to grad school usually in saint louis missouri and saint louis is just 

101.36 101.77 A: uh-huh 

103.64 104.01 B: i guess 

104.13 105.45 B: for some reason like 

105.71 111.70 B: all of the wind patterns in the world seem to converge and b- and blow in all of the pollen along with the humidity 

111.98 112.41 A: uh-huh 

112.23 113.02 B: and they just 

113.27 114.72 B: i mean there are severe problems 

114.99 115.52 B: there with 

115.74 117.30 B: allerg- seasonal allergies 

118.29 119.00 B: me i even 

119.13 121.12 B: even dogs get allergies there 

120.90 121.81 A: oh god 

122.68 132.54 A: yeah come to think of it i used to work uh as a secretary for the kansas veterinary medical association and some of our members were specialists in dog allergies 

132.38 132.70 B: oh 

134.09 134.36 B: yeah 

135.97 138.93 B: now do you believe the saying that they mentioned about um 

140.00 140.64 B: the cold 

140.08 141.09 A: um 

141.37 142.42 A: yeah i 

143.30 144.60 A: well i i think that 

145.11 149.61 A: once or twice in my lifetime i've managed to shorten the span of a cold but 

149.86 153.81 A: mostly yeah you get a cold it lasts for seven days no matter what 

153.67 154.05 B: yeah 

154.40 158.63 B: yeah i've never i guess i've never thought about going to the doctor just for a cold 

158.92 159.61 A: mhm 

160.28 162.09 A: no i i never have either 

162.05 162.44 B: yeah 

162.48 165.27 A: i mean like if i have a sore throat or something then i think 

165.53 167.52 A: an antibiotic would help then i'll go 

167.60 170.99 B: right or like the threat of strep i got strep a lot in high school 

172.13 173.37 B: i'm always nervous about that 

174.97 176.98 A: what are you studying in graduate school 

176.87 178.40 B: children language and literature 

178.49 179.10 A: oh 

179.20 179.63 B: yeah 

179.93 180.88 B: yeah i do um 

181.46 184.27 B: yeah mostly austrian literature and architecture right now 

184.44 184.91 A: mhm 

185.89 187.67 B: and do you still work for a veterinarian 

186.03 186.32 A: (( )) 

187.66 192.30 A: uh no i'm um i'm a teacher but right now i'm waiting for 

192.57 195.84 A: permission to work in quebec so i'm really doing nothing 

196.51 196.86 A: uh 

196.59 197.66 B: where did you teach before 

197.79 199.21 A: uh i taught in kansas 

199.51 200.31 B: uh-huh and w- 

199.95 200.32 A: i ta- 

200.57 203.47 A: i taught french and spanish at high school and college level 

203.90 204.74 B: oh wow 

205.41 206.42 B: oh that would be fun 

206.86 208.42 A: yeah college is fun 

208.30 211.09 B: yeah and i would think with french knowing french you'd be able to do it 

211.43 212.77 B: in quebec fairly easily 

213.28 216.87 A: well when i start working here i'll be teaching english as a second language 

217.07 217.40 B: oh 

217.80 220.43 A: because the people especially in my little area 

220.59 226.65 A: they they really don't have a chance to to learn english well there's no one to practice english with 

227.81 231.26 A: so they they come to english classes pretty well um 

231.59 232.84 A: handicapped 

233.15 233.42 B: oh 

233.88 235.36 B: oh i guess i never really i 

235.57 237.09 B: i've done i used to live in vermont 

237.33 237.68 A: uh-huh 

237.74 240.28 B: and so i ma- my my step father worked 

240.59 246.17 B: for the federal government doing transportation and as a result he had to work in quebec with companies that trucked 

243.44 243.74 A: oh 

246.34 247.39 B: things into the state 

247.63 248.06 A: oh 

248.32 249.11 B: and um 

249.42 254.05 B: so i've been up to montreal but i didn't seem montreal seemed to me so bilingual 

254.09 256.48 A: oh yeah (( )) definitely bilingual 

256.22 259.24 B: so the further and the more rural you get the less bilingual it gets 

259.45 260.64 A: absolutely 

260.23 260.66 B: oh 

260.83 264.24 A: yeah montreal is kind of this little island of 

264.69 265.19 A: it 

265.37 268.04 A: montreal is is an entity into itself 

268.24 268.76 A: and 

269.22 271.11 A: and the rest of quebec is quebec 

271.35 271.64 B: huh 

271.92 272.19 B: huh 

272.30 276.72 B: i guess maybe the university plays a role and just like the size and the amount of traffic 

277.33 281.42 A: yeah well and the fact that it's such a big industrial center 

281.67 282.64 A: with so much 

282.97 284.59 A: influence from the outside world 

284.73 287.09 A: and the airport and transportation and so forth 

287.58 288.99 A: business 

289.33 293.49 A: but the rest of quebec just pretty much keeps to itself speaks french and uh 

294.14 295.06 A: happy being 

295.33 296.70 A: the quebec 

296.01 299.54 B: yeah that's must be quite a change from kansas 

299.83 303.14 A: yeah it's uh it's a pleasant change um 

302.58 302.87 B: oh 

303.76 304.90 A: i don't know people here 

305.31 307.50 A: i i'm developing this theory that uh 

308.15 310.29 A: quebecers are kind to each other 

310.46 311.11 A: and 

311.85 313.25 A: um but very frugal 

313.51 315.80 A: so it's kind of like vermont in the frugality 

316.40 319.45 A: but they also they're very generous and last night i was at uh 

320.17 321.20 A: dunkin donuts 

322.09 323.25 A: in the states it seems like 

323.45 329.08 A: people go into dunkin donuts they get their coffee and donuts and they leave here they get their coffee and donuts and sit at a table 

326.56 326.86 B: yeah 

329.33 331.01 A: and they talk to somebody 

331.12 332.36 A: for hours 

332.46 338.63 A: that's so delightful to see people talking to each other and having a community life of some sort 

333.50 334.04 B: yeah 

335.42 336.11 B: yeah 

338.30 339.30 B: yeah yeah 

339.64 340.93 B: yeah i think that's sort of a 

341.12 346.49 B: a well i don't know i guess it's a general impression i get from even almost all over the world between north and south 

346.78 347.24 A: mhm 

347.24 348.27 B: that sometimes uh 

348.41 352.11 B: uh an issue i know in the north people might be more reserved and 

352.26 353.49 B: slightly frugal in a in a 

353.79 354.34 B: certain ways 

354.84 355.52 B: but um 

355.97 357.39 B: once you get to know them 

357.68 358.16 A: mhm 

357.77 358.39 B: and once 

358.57 359.93 B: they they really make efforts 

360.40 360.90 A: mm 

360.91 361.55 B: and um 

361.88 362.89 B: the south is just so 

364.04 365.58 B: immediately open and warm 

365.89 366.68 A: mhm 

366.51 367.54 B: i think at least 

367.82 368.42 B: at least 

368.75 372.45 B: saint louis seemed to be to me and that made it more southern for me 

372.65 373.35 A: mhm 

373.03 375.90 B: but people just sort of generally but they always keep it very 

376.20 376.86 B: superficial 

377.29 377.83 A: mm 

377.67 381.67 B: and they rarely actually sit down and take the time to chat for a long time 

381.96 383.08 A: yeah 

382.87 384.82 B: um and vermont is at least for 

386.15 387.23 B: vermont as i know they've 

387.50 388.39 B: they'll take the time 

388.77 389.87 B: they'll sit down 

390.14 393.45 B: they may not talk much at first but after a while 

391.63 392.44 A: uh-huh 

392.88 394.82 A: yup 

393.74 396.04 B: yeah 

396.35 397.92 B: yeah hm 

397.63 397.99 A: yeah 

398.13 399.88 B: yeah i miss the cold weather and 

400.86 402.27 B: people and everything in vermont 

403.36 404.86 B: i like cold weather i think the heat 

406.42 411.03 A: yeah i i think the cold weather makes people stronger getting sort of back onto the topic um 

410.53 412.32 B: mhm 

411.17 415.86 A: the i mean it makes stronger psychologically and physically too 

416.01 416.73 A: you know that 

417.03 420.62 A: the threat is out there so you have to steel yourself to it 

420.68 421.01 B: yeah 

421.04 424.37 A: but if it's always warm and nice oh well you know 

424.96 425.56 A: you you 

425.72 427.65 A: you'll get laid back you don't 

427.92 433.12 A: take many precautions and most of the time you get away with it but when i lived in venezuela 

433.79 434.19 A: (( )) 

434.44 439.89 A: it it seemed like if the temperature dropped five degrees everyone caught a cold 

439.81 440.42 B: yeah 

440.82 442.99 B: yeah i thought that was interesting recently 

443.09 447.60 B: that reminded me of somebody that um that whose from the bahamas and she can't even take 

446.47 446.90 A: mhm 

447.90 449.75 B: saint louis fall temperatures 

449.92 450.41 A: huh 

450.34 453.92 B: like she's immediately talking about how awfully cold it is and how 

453.39 454.63 A: oh my goodness 

454.30 456.95 B: and as a result she she drives a lot 

457.38 457.74 A: uh-huh 

457.51 459.98 B: and um stays inside and 

460.11 465.49 B: i mean un- probably doesn't 

465.85 468.35 B: i mean it probably ends up impacting her 

468.74 471.90 B: exercise habits and everything and the amount of time she spends out doors 

472.31 472.93 A: yea 

473.46 478.03 A: yea that's actually one reason i came to quebec cause i thought i'd be spending more time out doors and huh 

478.17 478.91 A: be healthier 

479.12 479.52 B: mm 

479.61 480.78 A: and and it's true 

480.97 485.00 A: course in the summer it's not so deathly hot so you can go out doors and not 

480.98 481.28 B: yea 

485.41 488.09 A: you know have a heat stroke but even in the winter 

486.68 486.99 B: right 

488.29 488.56 A: there's 

489.16 492.13 A: they're people riding there bicycles at twelve degrees 

492.27 492.94 B: wow 

493.05 493.60 A: and 

493.70 500.05 A: people just think nothing of walk a few block to the grocery store or the post office or where ever they need to go and 

500.24 501.69 A: they just get out and walk 

501.46 501.80 B: yea 

502.03 502.32 B: yea 

502.49 504.63 A: i think it's huh a much healthier way to live 

504.99 507.85 B: yea yea i agree i don't know i guess i like 

508.15 509.38 B: mean if your going to 

510.76 512.78 B: to me health being keep staying not 

512.99 518.25 B: or being healthy is combined with being out doors and i like being out doors in the cold so much better than the 

518.40 519.75 B: than the excessive heat 

519.90 520.62 A: yea 

521.47 530.35 A: yea and i try to explain this to people in quebec and they don't quite get it because there's never been an oppressive heat they think that when it gets up to thirty five 

530.53 532.27 A: centigrade in the summer but you know 

532.71 536.54 A: that they've gone to hell in a hand basket and they just can't 

537.12 541.84 A: imagine what it's like to have that day after day from may through september 

542.10 542.43 B: yea 

543.15 545.07 B: yea i've never even realized either 

545.73 551.30 B: being i mean i spent most of my time in northern countries in europe or in in 

551.50 553.65 B: northern states in america really 

553.66 554.11 A: mm 

553.79 557.23 B: and particularly in the summers i always spent summers either in oregon or vermont 

557.42 558.11 A: ah 

557.69 558.47 B: and hum 

558.85 561.28 B: and when i first had my first summer 

561.43 562.97 B: saint saint louis i i mean 

563.28 564.28 B: it's not you'll get 

564.78 566.07 B: physically sick or anything 

566.39 567.13 B: but you go nuts 

567.26 571.06 B: in a certain way and people like had there tempers (( )) 

571.34 571.89 A: mm 

571.42 576.17 B: there's a higher crime rate the hotter it gets because people just get so angry 

576.50 577.57 A: right 

577.50 579.03 B: so i mean there's a version of 

579.59 584.11 B: i guess psychological sickness or illness that comes a long with really hot humid 

585.23 586.08 B: oppressive heat 

586.28 590.08 A: you know and it's too hot to i mean like if you have a boy friend you can't even 

590.55 591.83 A: get close because 

591.94 596.58 A: it's too hot you don't want to do anything that makes you hotter 

592.90 594.68 B: yea 

595.75 600.42 B: yea over cold is just 

600.54 602.26 B: better and it keeps you healthier i think 

602.62 604.97 A: i think so yea sort of like hum 

605.18 607.91 A: are you old enough to remember the mary tyler moore 

608.15 609.53 A: series with 

609.86 611.32 A: she went to huh 

611.89 614.96 A: hum huh minnesota minneapolis to work 

616.53 617.08 A: d._r._p. 

617.51 621.76 B: yea i remember it clearly but i don't remember as many details about it 

621.90 628.00 A: yea well one of the lines from that was that she went to minnesota because it's colder and she thought she'd keep it better 

630.36 638.39 B: yea although i've heard like i guess there's also a danger of 

638.70 640.32 B: of an inability to navigate 

640.46 644.52 B: out side in the winter like minnesota i know for sure 

645.10 645.86 B: where they have 

646.22 647.49 B: a certain campuses 

647.99 648.77 B: like hum 

648.94 653.20 B: i know u. of minnesota have it in the winter they actually string 

653.75 656.96 B: ropes and things between buildings just in case you can't find a way 

657.26 658.19 A: oh 

659.36 660.54 A: hum 

660.54 660.90 B: yea 

661.73 669.24 B: and i don't know i've always i guess the one thing i loved about oregon was the ability that it never really got really warm and it never got seriously clod 

669.47 669.98 A: mm 

669.67 671.92 B: but you can always go to the mountains where it was really cold 

673.20 681.36 B: so you could sort of in where there was so much snow you didn't know what to do about it and i think if you had all that snow all the time 

677.61 678.21 A: mm 

681.85 682.44 B: i don't know 

683.76 684.73 B: i don't know i guess 

684.88 688.40 B: i guess that vermont had all the snow all the time just not above my head 

688.71 689.21 A: mm
