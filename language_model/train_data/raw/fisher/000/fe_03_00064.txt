0.01 1.23 B: hello 

0.86 1.98 A: hello 

1.73 2.73 B: how are you 

2.65 3.67 A: i'm fine 

4.72 5.71 A: how are you 

4.78 8.16 B: um good [laughter] my name's david 

7.66 9.07 A: oh my name's shelia 

9.50 10.52 B: (( shelia okay )) 

10.29 11.18 A: yes 

11.60 16.91 B: um what do you what do you think is uh the worst personal habit 

15.10 16.06 A: (( [noise] )) 

16.47 18.27 A: [cough] well lately i've been uh 

18.32 22.99 A: focused on gossiping i think that's very bad but i don't know if it's as bad as smoking 

22.82 23.64 B: right 

23.03 26.05 A: so i think smoking i'd have to pick that 

25.69 28.90 B: smoking yeah i i think gossiping is [cough] 

29.23 31.89 B: is is probably worse because 

32.83 42.61 B: i think um most of those other things you know only affect one person whereas gossiping usually doesn't affect the person who's doing the gossiping 

42.70 43.98 A: [noise] that's true 

44.30 52.57 A: [cough] well i i don't know maybe in fact uh it does i think a lot of people who gossip a lot end up spending a whole lot of time 

52.89 55.89 A: uh thinking about negative things and then 

55.94 59.15 A: that could have a negative impact on their life 

58.49 59.84 B: yeah 

60.40 68.64 A: if you're always focusing on um [cough] you know all the things that other people are doing that are interesting to gossip about 

68.79 70.39 A: you just seem to be kind of 

70.45 71.76 A: stewing in your 

72.08 73.44 A: negativity 

73.23 74.78 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

74.17 75.35 A: all the time 

75.22 82.36 B: right no i definitely i mean i i agree but what i was you know i i think that like [noise] 

75.46 76.04 A: (( [cough] )) 

83.18 84.41 B: whether they're 

84.53 86.89 B: whether someone that gossips is 

87.32 92.09 B: negative or not like a [noise] negative person doesn't really 

92.10 96.07 B: bother me but when they start talking about other people [noise] i [noise] 

93.42 94.46 A: right 

96.46 102.01 A: right and then there's smoking that you know [cough] that could bother other people all the secondhand smoke and all that 

101.12 103.13 B: yeah 

103.16 105.51 B: i take it you don't smoke 

105.16 107.82 A: no but my husband does and so [cough] 

106.37 107.43 B: oh okay 

107.57 108.21 B: (( um )) 

108.00 113.34 A: he's recently switched to cigars and i don't [cough] feel so great about that but 

113.35 116.15 A: it's better than the cigarettes [noise] 

115.45 123.33 B: right hm yeah i've actually contemplated that same move myself 

117.11 118.24 A: do you smoke 

118.93 120.01 A: [laughter] oh 

122.78 123.98 A: oh really 

123.41 127.22 B: yeah i think that would be like something that i could do 

127.91 132.49 A: right and it worked for him so he yeah he uh switched a year ago 

129.56 130.83 B: it did 

132.23 133.16 B: okay 

132.72 135.56 A: but now he's like smoking like four cigars a day 

135.47 136.41 B: okay 

136.49 139.59 A: and so in one hand it's good because 

140.15 142.02 A: you're not inhaling the smoke 

141.55 142.93 B: right 

142.41 153.05 A: but it it still is compulsive as it ever was you know the the need to light up and to have something in your hand and uh the cigar just replaces the cigarette 

152.33 154.02 B: right 

153.41 157.66 A: and then another the smoke co- that comes off a cigar is much i think 

158.03 160.17 B: it's very pungent yeah 

158.25 161.19 A: unhealthy yeah yeah 

161.32 163.00 A: and so i worry that 

163.50 168.81 A: really you're being exposed to a whole lot of smoke even though you're not smoking cigarettes 

168.23 171.50 B: right so so does he smoke in the house or 

171.24 173.05 A: oh yeah 

171.97 172.85 B: okay 

173.09 174.72 A: yeah so 

175.91 178.44 A: i i've been very conflicted about that 

178.75 185.23 A: because you know if if one nags a person they might give it up but i'm thinking well you know there's personal liberty 

185.75 188.38 A: you know a person has a right to do what they want 

187.68 189.16 B: right [cough] 

188.70 190.48 A: and who am i to say 

190.87 193.98 A: that you you know smoking should be completely done away with 

193.77 198.15 B: right yeah yeah it's a stupid habit i mean 

199.83 202.52 B: (( you know i admit that it's just i don't know )) 

202.05 203.58 A: how long have you been smoking 

203.56 208.01 B: (( i guess probably [mn] eighteen years )) 

209.04 211.42 A: so about what age did you start 

210.75 212.48 B: twenty 

212.34 214.07 A: oh that's pretty late [mn] 

213.73 215.51 B: yeah i started late 

215.55 217.98 B: i was over in uh in europe 

219.35 230.23 A: well my father's been smoking since he was five and so both of my parents smoke and i think they always will and um a lot of people start really young and they just never stop 

222.30 223.10 B: (( wow )) 

229.63 233.07 B: yeah wow five is really young 

232.51 235.78 A: [lipsmack] but you know a little k- kid kinda playing around and then 

234.13 235.06 B: yeah 

236.94 239.15 A: by the time you're twelve you're hooked 

238.97 240.41 B: yeah [mn] 

240.94 245.58 B: oddly enough i was pretty i was anti smoking up until the time i started smoking 

245.83 246.90 A: really 

246.49 248.68 B: [mn] yeah i wouldn't i remember when i was 

249.21 253.66 B: uh younger i first got my i wouldn't let people smoke in my car 

253.58 254.73 A: (( [laughter] )) 

255.01 260.80 B: and whereas now i smoke i mean i i smoke outside i don't smoke in the house 

262.93 267.49 B: um because my wife's kind of against that but i do go outside 

267.81 276.19 A: [mn] yeah you hear that a lot a lot of people will have people smoke outside of their house and and i contemplate that but i just i don't know i just think 

276.43 279.42 A: what's the point you know i mean smoke goes everywhere 

277.84 279.02 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

279.08 282.84 B: right well are you in a warm weather environment or 

282.45 284.23 A: pretty mild yeah 

284.29 286.19 A: i guess if it were colder 

286.95 290.10 A: you you'd get stuffy inside 

289.41 292.18 B: oh yeah yeah um 

292.55 299.31 B: although i never really noticed it but i just thought it it i think it's effective like i have cut down a little bit 

299.69 302.83 B: like generally speaking we have our uh 

303.61 317.94 B: t._v. room up on the second floor and um when i go up there to watch t._v. pretty much i'm done for the night [cough] whereas a couple of years ago when i was smoking in the house i would i would you know occasionally smoke up there as well 

318.76 327.36 A: well my husband uh he's forty five and he got a lung x ray and the doctor told him he had the lungs of a ninety five year old man 

327.06 328.18 B: [noise] oof 

327.84 330.05 A: so that did it you know that was the 

330.44 333.33 A: the uh motivation to stop smoking 

332.97 333.99 B: yeah 

333.42 337.81 A: and in fact uh the breathing and everything got much better immediately 

336.41 340.24 B: oh it did you with smoking with switching to cigars 

339.66 343.29 A: yeah immediately the breathing was uh improved 

342.99 343.87 B: huh 

344.04 351.31 A: [mn] but i can't imagine you know it's just a slow a slowing of the decline of the lungs that has happened and so 

351.47 353.03 A: the other smoke is going to 

353.09 354.62 A: affect it as well 

354.16 356.17 B: right 

356.44 361.54 A: but i wish you the best i mean i hope you don't get emphysema or something terrible like that 

356.61 357.88 B: right 

360.81 364.34 B: (( oh thanks [laughter] yeah it's kinda [mn] )) 

364.58 365.64 B: um 

365.68 367.75 B: yeah 

367.88 369.48 B: yeah i i you know 

369.49 373.84 B: keep saying i'm going to quit maybe maybe i will after having this 

374.66 375.50 A: (( [laughter] )) 

374.73 376.19 B: conversation 

377.42 381.23 B: yeah i've always i've never been a big cigar smoker though um 

380.88 381.91 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

381.43 386.73 B: but i i think it's like it's something i thought maybe would be like a good crutch for a while 

387.09 389.68 A: [cough] oh i think so i think there's um 

390.78 403.98 A: you know there's a certain compulsivity to smoking and the cigars seem to to satisfy that because there's all this stuff on the internet you can you know order cigars over the internet you can order these humidors you can you know there's all these accessories 

393.79 395.32 B: yeah 

404.00 404.87 B: right 

404.24 408.00 A: for cigars and that really kind of fills that need to obsess 

406.96 409.03 B: yeah 

408.29 410.65 A: about the the thing and 

410.96 416.67 B: yeah no uh interest you know does he smoke big cigars i'm actually curious because [mn] 

414.19 415.87 A: yeah they're pretty big 

416.77 417.99 B: yeah 

417.40 418.92 A: yeah yeah 

418.13 420.47 B: and so they last for a long time 

419.88 428.13 A: yeah yeah and and that's kind of an interesting dilemma because you know a cigarette is if it's half done you kinda just toss it but a 

420.72 421.49 B: okay 

425.06 426.41 B: couple of minutes 

427.70 428.81 B: yeah 

428.24 431.02 A: half done cigar you don't really wanna toss it 

430.38 432.31 B: right 

432.43 435.52 A: and so we're he's always saving them and 

432.56 433.44 B: like it 

433.46 434.25 B: oh 

435.31 436.31 B: okay 

436.43 437.74 A: but 

437.83 444.30 B: well i guess that's kind of interesting because like if it m- m- certainly must have must cut down on like those like 

444.30 453.39 B: cigarettes where you're just kind of compulsory you know like i know i i teach at the university and after class i have a tendency to go outside and smoke a cigarette 

454.05 458.32 B: just because i've been doing that for so long and um 

458.89 462.91 B: i guess if i smoked cigars i would probably stop doing that 

463.58 465.59 A: mm because of the time 

465.08 470.17 B: because of the time yeah you only have a couple of minutes in between classes or something and 

466.53 467.74 A: yeah 

469.83 481.34 A: yeah that's true [mn] you couldn't really easily because the the fire on the ends takes a while to go out and you can't really tamp them down apparently the expert cigar smokers say [laughter] you're not supposed to do that 

474.86 475.91 B: yeah 

479.75 480.92 B: [laughter] 

480.99 482.19 B: right 

481.61 484.00 A: so then uh you're stuck with this 

484.07 485.87 A: lit cigar [mn] 

485.42 488.34 B: yeah i actually contemplated going to a pipe 

488.25 489.37 A: [laughter] 

490.04 491.02 B: um 

492.13 495.78 B: be- just because of the the you know you can 

496.72 503.52 B: from what i've ex- from what i've seen pipe smokers seem to always be lighting and putting out lighting and putting out 

504.14 505.11 A: right 

504.17 507.27 B: but i really should probably just quit cold turkey 

508.14 509.98 B: might be the best [mn] 

511.34 516.48 A: right but you know the the pipe and the professorial thing that would go go together 

516.15 519.01 B: yeah i guess [laughter] uh 

519.07 521.90 B: i don't see too many people smoking a pipe any more 

521.77 523.90 A: no it would draw draw attention 

524.63 525.82 B: (( yeah um )) 

526.03 529.52 B: where are you calling from or oklahoma okay 

527.28 528.45 A: oklahoma how 

529.34 530.25 A: about you 

529.98 531.45 B: uh philadelphia 

532.68 536.16 B: so do you does it get cold there in the winter is it cold there now or 

535.36 541.82 A: it it gets damp like this week it was in the thirties so it was chilly but that was the first time this year 

538.11 539.05 B: okay 

539.56 540.42 B: okay 

541.34 543.00 B: oh all right 

542.07 545.35 A: [mn] and you know probably february january it's 

545.76 549.18 A: quite cold and sometimes icy but not for very long 

548.86 549.76 B: okay 

551.10 552.75 A: are you guys under snow 

552.09 555.13 B: hm yeah we are oh it's so annoying 

555.25 563.18 B: we're not really like we don't really get it every year and when we do it doesn't stick around or it usually um and so 

563.11 575.05 B: it's just no one's really prepared for it it just becomes kind of chaos to a certain degree fortunately i live near the uh near the university so i can walk and everything like 

565.64 566.79 A: right 

575.70 577.19 B: (( that but it's still )) 

578.59 580.08 B: (( um kind of frustrating )) 

581.35 584.57 A: yeah i when i moved out here i thought i would miss the snow 

584.17 585.30 B: (( but mhm )) 

584.71 590.13 A: and um and i do i miss how it looks but i really don't miss like walking around in it and 

589.51 593.67 B: yeah especially in the city you know a couple of days it gets all black and 

594.10 594.99 A: yeah 

594.33 595.70 B: (( gross and everything )) 

595.37 600.64 A: and the stuff on the street and you step in it and it gets all over your clothes and it's just very unpleasant 

597.69 598.86 B: yeah 

600.33 602.95 B: yeah where are you from originally 

602.85 604.37 A: uh west virginia 

603.90 604.98 B: (( oh okay )) 

604.60 605.55 A: how about you 

605.61 607.78 B: i'm actually from philadelphia 

607.87 611.83 A: oh wow so [mn] not so far yeah 

609.02 610.54 B: never left 

611.35 616.67 B: [mn] um i think i'll eventually have to have to leave though i'm trying to find 

617.18 618.81 B: a more permanent 

620.23 621.27 A: right 

621.93 623.71 A: how do you like academia 

623.38 625.26 B: (( position so um )) 

625.36 628.98 B: i like it well that's one of those things one of my things about gossip 

629.04 631.48 B: it's very uh i'm in a small department 

630.09 631.13 A: really 

631.50 637.12 B: i'm in a german department and i mean i have been at at various places um 

633.13 634.07 A: mhm 

637.59 638.83 B: in the uh 

639.01 651.10 B: they gossip i i don't know i guess at a certain point you have to draw a line between politics and gossip right now they kind of all seem like one to me and it's just it's just really bad you know the he said she said stuff 

651.10 652.19 A: mhm 

651.27 665.56 B: in a small department is is really bad other than that i like it a lot i i like um i like uh the teaching it uh um both at graduate level and undergraduate level i enjoy that 

666.07 672.00 B: um were it not for the politics and the lack of funding [mn] 

671.54 673.17 A: right yeah 

672.40 674.71 B: you know lack of resources 

674.74 675.86 B: in a uh 

676.84 679.96 B: i guess this department it doesn't really bring in a lot of money 

680.08 685.01 B: so you know we don't get a lot of money but other than that it's fi- other than that i like it 

682.84 683.89 A: right 

684.75 690.76 A: yeah i don't like the politics either and i i didn't think there would be so much you know i think i picked 

691.03 698.27 A: you know graduate school and academia because i thought for some reason it [mn] was going to be different from the rest of the world 

698.09 700.08 B: yeah i did too [mn] 

699.58 701.05 A: and i was wrong 

700.91 704.62 B: oh yeah to a certain degree i think it might be even worse 

704.46 709.26 A: right because the stakes are so small that's what i've come to see is it 

709.48 710.40 A: (( you know )) 

710.61 714.62 A: people just fight over the smallest and stupidest things 

710.65 711.64 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

713.57 719.12 B: right fighting over the over yeah and i think they're probably you know
