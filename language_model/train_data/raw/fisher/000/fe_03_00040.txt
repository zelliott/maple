216.28 218.21 B: be able to take a pill to fix everything 

219.02 223.18 A: uh it depends there's abuse on that like the kids on (( ritalin )) and stuff 

223.40 223.78 A: but 

225.74 228.45 A: i don't think there's a pill that cures everything but there's something 

229.01 229.80 A: for convenience 

232.38 232.71 A: so 

233.67 234.06 B: yeah -m 

234.94 237.10 B: -cause um yeah i'm think- about going in to 

237.28 240.07 B: pharmaceutical industry and some people say oh that's awful 

240.52 240.96 B: to like look 

242.21 242.60 B: you know 

243.13 243.95 B: it's like okay 

244.65 247.00 B: what do people need to do to get healthier

250.09 250.59 A: yeah 

250.12 250.83 B: to eat less 

251.46 253.42 B: stop smoking and drink in moderation 

253.52 255.71 A: and a lot of people aren't going to do that 

253.58 254.15 B: are they (( gonna )) 

254.71 255.00 B: right 

255.26 258.06 B: are they (( gonna )) do that no so i might as well make money off of it

259.78 260.17 B: (( )) 

261.67 262.16 B: oh cool 

264.03 266.56 B: yeah and it's just like okay what can you actually do 

267.29 269.20 B: if you can't change their behavior 

270.01 272.61 B: then you know you can treat like okay granted 

273.01 273.59 B: trauma 

274.48 276.57 B: you know something needs to be done obviously but 

276.61 276.99 A: yeah 

277.19 279.03 B: some of the long term stuff is just like 

280.89 282.65 A: you can treat the symptoms but not 

281.86 282.22 B: right 

283.59 285.01 A: the stuff behind it 

285.50 287.27 B: but no that yeah that's one reason i 

288.94 290.90 B: didn't take the opportunity to go to 

290.99 291.80 B: medical school 

292.13 293.04 A: aw
