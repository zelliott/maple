50.79 55.99 B: most of the time i try to fight it off because i don't care for um 

56.13 56.71 B: um 

56.96 68.63 B: so many of the drugs now just don't work like the antibiotics they warn you warn you against it so you know i'll go by taking more vitamin c. and um 

59.78 60.16 A: yeah 

61.24 61.51 A: yeah 

63.62 64.02 A: mhm 

69.02 69.52 B: um 

69.89 70.81 B: liquids 

71.83 72.19 A: yeah 

72.09 73.30 B: i bet you 

75.35 77.06 A: uh well let's see um 

78.15 82.20 A: i get sick quite a bit so and i'm pretty much 

83.28 86.13 A: i don't want to say a baby maybe i'm a hypochondriac 

86.22 91.03 A: and i do tend to go to the doctors but generally i think the doctors are getting better because they don't 

91.48 99.96 A: automatically when i was growing up they would automatically give you an antibiotic and that was it and i mean th- you always knew you were going to goto the doctor and get an antibiotic but now they don't au- do that all the time 

100.22 104.92 A: they'll say you know like you said drink more liquids and and um 

105.02 106.51 A: get plenty of rest and 

106.79 107.80 A: maybe eat some more 

107.93 111.18 A: balanced meals or fruits or vegetables or what have you 

111.33 113.14 A: but um so 

113.57 116.42 A: i don't know what were the other questions 

114.50 114.83 B: (( )) 

121.77 129.37 B: it is a fact that um you know um in the winter time because of uh 

129.48 130.68 B: the time change 

131.63 134.44 B: um you getting dark earlier 

131.69 132.13 A: yeah 

135.12 135.69 B: um 

135.91 138.63 B: people have more of a tendency of uh 

139.25 140.28 B: becoming ill 

140.50 145.53 A: well that yeah and the different the changes in the weather i don't know where you are but we'll you know one day we'll have 

145.79 148.53 A: sixty degree weather and the next day it will be twenty degree weather 

148.85 150.48 A: and that happens all the time 

148.88 149.68 B: well 

150.60 154.70 B: yeah see fortunately um i'm in southern california 

154.78 158.42 A: oh i'm in upstate new york 

154.85 156.20 B: and um 

157.69 160.58 B: yeah wow yeah 

158.60 161.66 A: a little bit of diff- difference 

161.46 166.37 B: yeah so the the weather i think is a big big factor and uh 

162.34 162.64 A: so 

168.49 173.68 B: um our days are so warm so you more or less um 

174.43 176.77 B: have to layer yourself with clothes 

177.00 177.39 A: yeah 

177.46 183.59 B: because you're taking them off and then um right now it's cold so i have a bit of the heat on 

181.82 182.30 A: mhm 

184.02 186.50 B: um and the mornings are cold but 

186.86 188.72 B: a nice sunny day um 

188.90 189.24 B: i'm 

189.38 192.82 B: just in a turtleneck and i and i feel fine 

193.67 195.87 A: well it's a i- i mean i think that 

196.28 198.97 A: that holds pretty much for where ever you are because 

199.52 199.96 A: where- 

200.06 203.89 A: where we are (( )) you have to layer anyway because they heat the building 

204.91 209.65 A: most of the time they heat the building so hot that where i'm working it's eighty degrees 

210.02 210.48 A: and yet 

210.79 211.41 B: uh-huh 

210.93 215.10 A: today when i went to work it was twenty so i had to have quite quite a bit on 

215.22 218.98 A: and not just a heavy jacket i had to have on a like a sweatshirt and sweater and 

219.67 225.06 A: and but you have to go in layers to peel off when you get to work because otherwise you get to hot and that's when i think people get colds 

225.26 229.03 B: it's true th- this is why i was kind of um 

225.47 226.03 A: (( )) 

231.95 240.28 B: excuse me not knowing what to say because uh a lot of times i think i have a cold but i think it's just like allergies 

240.02 240.43 A: mhm 

240.82 251.55 B: and um that's difficult you know unless you get the right doctor and um again i can't take um over the counter medicine because um 

252.10 254.27 B: my body seems to react to it 

254.36 254.80 A: yeah 

254.54 255.47 B: so uh 

255.04 256.52 A: react badly like 

256.05 258.30 B: yeah react badly yeah 

259.33 259.95 B: yeah 

260.18 262.89 A: well i'm not i used to i used to take a 

260.26 260.69 B: (( )) 

263.05 274.43 A: quite a lot of over the counter medications but i just recently had my first child and i got used to not taking them which was a good thing i think so now i very rarely you know 

270.86 271.49 B: mhm 

274.70 281.52 A: take anything and to tell the truth i i think i'm just the same as if as i was when i was you know 

281.81 284.10 A: taking over the counter medicines it wasn't 

283.43 284.04 B: mhm 

284.26 286.08 A: it wasn't helping as much as i thought it was 

286.51 288.27 B: well that's wonderful 

288.43 290.59 B: that you have a a new baby 

290.65 291.61 A: yeah yeah 

291.31 292.89 B: oh how great 

292.15 298.65 A: yeah and he gets sick more than i do so but i think that's just from being around other little kids and everything 

298.41 300.03 B: oh sure sure 

300.14 302.54 A: but yeah we just went through we just went through the 

300.94 301.56 B: yeah 

302.69 308.93 A: the group with him and that was fun so i'm learning about all sorts of new colds and 

306.04 306.81 B: (( hm )) 

309.30 311.12 A: baby illnesses and 

311.74 313.52 A: everything they could possibly catch 

313.70 314.41 B: uh-huh 

314.00 316.40 A: so but overall i i would rather have a cold 

316.89 319.49 A: than something more serious if he gets a lot of colds that's 

319.93 321.01 A: we can handle that 

320.72 321.70 B: oh sure 

321.91 322.62 B: yeah 

322.75 332.91 B: yeah because isn't it true that babies have a tendency of like uh running a high fever and as long as you kind of keep that fever down 

333.44 334.04 A: well they 

334.36 335.08 A: i mean 

335.45 337.46 A: i i don't know about tendency of running them he's 

337.58 338.63 A: he seems to get them 

338.77 344.97 A: often um between colds and teething and and such but they um 

342.76 343.34 B: mhm 

343.87 344.46 B: yeah 

346.23 349.40 A: i know that when when they're real little you're supposed to 

349.56 351.07 A: you're supposed to 

351.32 356.93 A: take them to the doctor if they have you know a fever of over like a hundred and one but once they pass like three or four months 

354.67 355.62 B: true 

357.52 361.13 A: then it is more common that their fevers get higher and it's not a real 

361.29 362.15 A: big deal because 

362.23 362.83 B: mhm 

362.76 363.62 A: i don't know why (( that )) 

363.78 364.75 A: why that is but 

365.27 366.69 A: so apparently if he has a 

366.77 368.31 A: higher fever right now it's not as 

369.18 370.34 A: not as much as a problem 

370.50 370.83 A: but 

371.88 375.14 A: and with him we don't feed him drugs either really 

374.48 375.04 B: oh that's 

375.15 378.05 B: that's good but you never know 

377.98 378.72 A: yeah 

378.52 381.49 B: yeah it this is my first call how about you 

381.52 385.28 A: yeah it as a matter of fact i just signed up a couple of hours ago 

382.17 382.72 B: yeah 

385.47 386.15 B: uh-huh 

385.51 386.76 A: so 

386.86 387.48 B: yeah 

387.02 388.43 A: i was quite surprised to get it 

388.32 391.07 B: do we have to speak a certain amount of time 

391.22 392.97 A: i'm assuming (( that be )) 

393.17 394.08 B: they'll come back 

393.81 394.61 A: that the 

394.78 397.11 A: rec- recorder comes on line and says 

396.58 397.17 B: uh-huh 

397.70 400.77 A: and says okay that's enough so 

397.75 398.36 B: yeah 

399.87 400.75 B: well 

400.86 409.71 B: illnesses are um it's kind of good to discuss it because i know with my uh friend's little granddaughter 

409.99 412.33 B: um so many time you know um 

412.71 423.83 B: they were in a bit of a panic you know because she was running a high temperature and um they brought her down to emergency they sent her right home you know with tylenol and um 

416.47 416.89 A: mhm 

424.30 426.40 B: very little medication and 

426.77 429.40 B: sure enough after you know a day or two 

430.85 431.53 A: yeah 

431.10 433.56 B: she got back to um her old self 

433.17 435.49 A: well i think with with the kids 

436.23 439.32 A: it's more important like if i f- if i feel really 

440.18 441.57 A: (( gross )) sometimes i'll know it's 

441.71 445.23 A: just a cold and i might wait it out but 

445.32 452.52 A: with any little thing especially with a first baby with any little thing it's like it's not worth it i'm just going to the doctor and if they send me home and say he'll be fine 

452.86 453.97 A: you know i'd rather have that 

453.98 455.11 B: oh sure 

454.36 456.48 A: then have it develop into something more serious 

456.43 457.23 B: yeah 

457.37 459.82 B: yeah well they um 

461.32 468.54 B: i think after a dozen visits yeah they're more a little more um laid back but they would never um 

463.68 464.05 A: yeah 

467.50 468.12 A: yeah 

469.18 471.23 B: you know take any chances 

470.80 472.01 A: oh yeah yeah 

471.55 472.09 B: yeah 

472.22 476.39 B: but i noticed uh i took care of my mom and um 

476.93 478.44 B: she had had a stroke 

478.49 478.88 A: mhm 

478.54 482.99 B: and there definitely were um signs you know of when you know 

483.29 486.16 B: going into um autumn and winter 

486.83 489.33 B: you know there was a little more um 

489.80 490.65 B: depression 

490.79 491.37 A: mhm 

491.77 493.05 B: and um 

495.68 496.77 B: so um 

496.21 498.15 A: well i think the i think the um 

498.72 501.84 A: the change in the time like you said does have something to do with it and that's 

500.58 501.16 B: yeah 

501.55 502.04 B: uh-huh 

502.13 504.63 A: that's tied into the depression and the whole 

504.75 507.20 A: the sad syndrome the sunlight deprivation 

507.55 508.16 B: yeah 

508.01 515.18 A: syndrome i mean it when it first came out everybody was like oh that's (( hokey )) but it's true that when you know when you go into work and it's dark and you come out and it's 

508.37 508.97 B: uh-huh 

515.51 516.92 A: dark again it- 

516.44 517.00 B: mhm 

517.17 519.41 A: it's really is sort of depressing and 

525.62 526.02 A: mhm 

526.80 527.92 B: he hates winter 

528.03 528.41 A: mhm 

528.50 532.22 B: he said i hate it i wake up it's dark 

532.72 541.12 B: i come home it's dark and we always got such a kick out of him you know we would be laughing you know but um 

534.70 535.07 A: yeah 

541.37 542.36 A: (( that's )) true 

541.95 542.65 B: yeah 

542.98 543.68 B: yeah 

554.69 557.07 A: to do stuff where as when it's a nice 

556.05 556.64 B: mhm 

557.32 560.83 A: summer night or spring night and you get out and it's still sunny out 

561.27 564.00 A: you just feel y- you walk outside (( and there's )) sun and it's 

564.16 568.20 A: invigorating and you want to keep going but i think that the 

565.30 566.26 B: oh sure 

566.47 567.02 B: yeah 

569.08 570.46 A: i think all the darkness does
