80.03 80.99 B: nasty stuff would 

81.70 83.45 B: everybody in the dorm would come down with something 

83.65 84.94 A: yeah it's as bad as being in daycare 

85.12 85.57 B: so 

85.43 87.96 A: uh so have have the seasons changed wherever you are

101.24 101.95 A: just wait a minute 

101.32 103.96 B: th- g- the yeah the good thing about oh- yeah exactly 

104.95 107.44 B: you don't like the weather you just wait a minute exactly 

107.60 112.06 A: oh by the way how closely are we supposed to keep to this this little topic that we've got set up about healthcare 

112.55 113.89 B: i'm not sure -cause 

114.08 115.22 B: i don't know i mean 

116.28 118.79 B: beats me uh 

118.49 121.08 A: or is that just supposed to be something to spur off further conversation 

121.50 125.20 B: i suppose i don't know um anyway 

125.37 128.53 A: yeah who listens to a robot tell you what to talk about anyway 

125.66 126.69 B: yeah i don't know 

127.78 128.83 B: exactly 

128.95 129.65 A: yeah 

128.98 132.00 B: i think that should be the topic uh um 

131.86 132.70 A: yeah ha 

132.22 135.70 B: can robots teach what happens when robots try to tell humans what to say 

136.25 138.05 B: and whose idea was it 

138.28 140.27 B: to allow these robots (( )) 

138.36 138.94 A: i don't know 

140.52 145.04 A: or remember um do you know the the kurzweil um electronic organs and stuff like that 

145.77 149.46 A: or the the kurzweil (( )) there's this guy named ray kurzweil 

145.83 146.65 B: no uh uh 

149.65 151.76 A: who is something of a a robotic 

149.66 150.14 B: uh-huh 

152.50 152.97 B: uh-huh 

152.52 160.27 A: sort of a guy and he predicts that the singularity which is the time when human and machine intelligence will merge is going to happen sometime within the next century 

160.69 161.38 B: interesting 

161.60 166.40 A: and he's eating an extra super low calorie diet to try and keep himself alive long enough to witness that 

167.56 168.35 B: wow 

168.44 170.84 A: see that's health that's health okay 

170.67 173.26 B: there you go yeah the low calorie diet thing 

173.18 174.39 A: yeah well uh i- like 

174.57 177.25 A: a thousand calories a day there there are a lot of people who uh 

177.90 180.54 A: who try that who think it's going to lead to longevity it it works in mice 

180.76 182.32 A: but a lot of things work in mice that don't 

182.51 183.60 A: necessarily work in 

183.43 188.13 B: yeah actually uh my fiancee is uh she worked in the uh 

188.60 189.18 B: um 

189.33 190.35 B: psychology lab 

190.30 190.86 A: uh-huh 

190.46 194.42 B: and she said that actually contrary to popular belief the the rats that they 

194.54 195.06 B: deprive 

195.45 197.49 B: of food live longer than the rats that they don't 

197.61 198.02 A: yeah 

198.11 198.87 B: because uh 

198.26 198.60 A: yeah 

199.10 201.82 B: they actually uh the metabolism speeds up the 

202.27 202.97 B: breakdown of the 

203.34 206.28 B: it leads to cancer which is what kills most i guess rats 

206.54 207.27 A: mhm an- 

207.02 207.65 B: as far as i know 

207.82 208.11 A: most 

208.27 210.10 A: a lot of americans too 

209.68 211.83 B: probably true oh definitely 

211.02 216.79 A: my father always claims that if you kept guinea pigs in the garage their metabolism would go more slowly and they'd live longer too but 

217.07 218.60 A: instead of keeping them in the house where it's warmer 

219.86 222.40 A: yeah i thought it was a pretty strange thing to say too but i 

222.12 222.64 B: yeah 

222.97 223.30 A: never 

224.01 225.75 A: kept a cold pack of guinea pigs versus uh 

226.30 229.59 A: tropical guinea pigs (( )) and we could feed them kitchen scraps more easily 

229.81 230.61 B: yeah 

231.36 237.39 A: so do do you have any sort of linguistically interesting thing to say to try to get yourself a a famous speech person in twenty five phone calls and stuff like that 

238.04 239.30 B: i don't know um 

239.69 240.90 B: see uh 

240.99 244.69 B: not really actually that's kind of sad now i think about it i uh 

244.84 246.14 B: really don't have anything very 

246.78 247.47 A: oh my husband 

246.88 247.36 B: ah

250.46 250.82 A: um 

251.47 253.42 A: one uh speech recognition guy who 

254.28 255.20 A: worked on um 

255.65 257.37 A: different length syllables for a little while 

258.14 258.73 A: and 

259.24 264.66 A: what he had these sentences that were very odd that had syllables of different lengths so one of the short syllables was i pop a tip of a pipe 

265.52 266.11 B: uh huh 

266.08 269.32 A: (( )) long syllables was franz glimpsed bleached flesh

304.45 304.70 B: i 

305.82 308.94 B: a- at first i was thinking about going to graduate school in english and 

309.10 310.15 B: then i decided that

312.99 314.41 B: it didn't seem like a 

315.17 316.91 B: the opportunity for um 

318.06 318.68 B: i don't know 

319.56 320.32 B: kind of a limited 

320.47 324.38 B: scope of i guess what you can do as far as especially as far as helping other people which i 

322.30 322.82 A: mhm 

324.65 325.82 B: think would be an important part of 

326.08 326.82 B: what i'm going to do 

327.06 328.40 A: are you thinking of doing public interest law 

328.58 329.79 B: yeah probably 

330.32 331.87 A: any any particular area or 

332.01 332.70 B: um 

333.18 334.81 B: i'm not sure i'm probably 

335.05 337.78 B: i mean my interests are in uh 

338.83 342.82 B: enviro- environmental issues and labor and ah um

343.41 343.85 B: uh 

344.15 345.20 B: things of that nature 

345.42 346.70 B: civil rights stuff like that 

347.56 347.94 B: so

362.34 364.44 B: yeah that sort of thing is um 

365.03 366.99 B: is probably what i'm interested in 

367.18 367.88 B: is uh 

368.39 369.50 B: doing stuff like uh 

370.71 373.95 B: i don't know it it depends i'll have to see like where uh

534.66 535.29 B: yeah 

535.81 536.58 B: it's true 

536.04 537.40 A: which is really scary 

538.01 546.64 B: yeah i was actually uh i'm i'm looking at programs to apply to now that have debt forgiveness programs that for uh public interest work 

546.62 546.95 A: yeah 

547.54 549.18 B: so that's actually a uh 

549.86 552.44 B: you know factoring in pretty heavily on where i decide to go -cause 

558.14 558.55 A: it affect 

558.65 564.35 A: the uh other person i had i knew a couple that was getting caught up in all this um rigamarole

567.66 571.88 A: they just didn't want the husband's money to disappear rather he wasn't a husband yet cause they didn't get married because 

572.40 574.39 A: you know it's a legal situation 

574.30 575.20 B: exactly 

574.85 576.35 A: you'll find out it's a legal choice 

576.81 578.38 A: a lot of people don't realize that when they get married 

578.61 579.18 B: yeah 

579.17 581.08 A: i'm not sure we did but you know we're still married 

581.81 582.24 A: like
