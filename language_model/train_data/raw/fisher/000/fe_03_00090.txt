5.53 11.48 A: i think probably the show i used to watch a lot when i was in college i always watched the real world 

11.68 12.44 B: oh really 

12.22 16.09 A: on m._t._v. and then of course road rules and all 

16.42 18.94 A: people that were my age i wanted to see 

19.10 21.66 B: i never watched the real that was on m._t._v. right 

19.34 19.95 A: (( )) 

21.42 21.68 A: yup 

21.91 24.98 B: i've never actually lived any place that had cable 

25.10 28.03 B: so i've never i've never seen that but um 

42.69 45.08 A: yeah they get to live in like such a posh 

45.53 49.56 A: place and they you know a fancy city and just basically 

49.78 52.83 A: they don't have to have a job they get to do whatever they want 

51.42 52.14 B: yeah 

52.36 54.42 B: i think that's why he wanted to get on the show 

54.72 56.45 A: so it was kind of you know 

56.89 58.97 A: just the the weekly break from 

59.17 60.70 A: the grind of college and 

61.43 62.11 A: a chance to 

62.37 64.80 A: to think oh gee wouldn't that be nice 

65.10 66.55 B: but i i thought that um 

66.66 71.81 B: part of that was wasn't there some scandal or something where they said that part of that was fake 

71.98 73.59 A: yes there's always been 

74.25 76.24 A: the thought that oh 

76.40 77.75 A: that would never work and 

78.17 85.54 A: they had like a kind of a a satire one where they got so tired of people saying that's fake that's fake that they made a fake one 

85.82 87.40 B: oh really that's pretty funny 

86.46 88.58 A: yes and told people what to say and 

88.71 89.90 A: you know to argue and 

90.31 91.14 A: and things like that 

91.73 92.34 A: i do 

91.82 92.19 B: um 

92.58 97.00 A: on occasion i watch survivor but i'm not an addict i don't have to watch it every week 

97.36 107.20 B: yeah i've watched it a couple of times my sister and her husband love it they they have um survivor parties and they invite people over and 

106.94 108.87 A: my boyfriend has to watch it every week 

107.35 108.25 B: and watch that 

109.68 110.36 A: have to 

109.70 110.31 B: yeah 

110.66 111.00 A: and i 

111.10 115.88 A: you know i can't call and disturb or anything that is his time with the t._v. 

112.42 113.99 B: yeah 

124.39 125.89 B: and i said something like 

126.35 131.41 B: i i i asked her a question you know like who is that person and she got really well 

131.86 136.68 B: she didn't say she was upset but it was clear that it was not time to ask questions and 

134.77 136.99 A: you should have known and 

136.83 142.91 B: i i should have reviewed that on my own and but 

137.52 138.49 A: (( )) for the end 

142.13 144.04 A: i don't have cable now because i live 

144.15 145.31 A: back out in the sticks 

145.54 146.55 B: where do you live 

146.37 149.94 A: i live in a really small town between rochester and buffalo new york 

149.96 152.36 B: oh okay i'm from uh new york city 

151.79 152.27 A: oh 

152.72 161.96 A: and so now no more real world and now i just kind of roll my eyes at that whole thing however i'm so embarrassed i got sucked in to the bachelor 

162.30 163.67 A: i did 

162.53 174.21 B: oh i've watched that a couple of times but it's so hokey they do the same thing every time and and no one ever catches supposedly no one catches on like the part in dinner where you have three tasks and 

166.82 168.30 A: i know but i just 

174.05 174.85 A: oh no 

174.43 176.24 B: you would think people would 

174.97 177.57 A: that's that's um meet the parents 

177.28 180.37 B: oh that's different okay yeah sorry sorry yeah 

178.37 178.67 A: yeah 

180.38 181.06 A: but i 

181.22 187.83 A: i watched that with my dad when i went back over to my parent's house and because my dad thinks it's hysterical and of course he wishes 

188.59 193.26 A: you know oh i should do that with your boyfriend i could get him to come over and i could have somebody 

193.29 195.03 B: yeah ask questions 

193.39 193.92 A: like that 

194.66 198.41 A: yeah but i think they filmed them a bunch in the beginning before 

198.58 200.51 B: oh i for everyone new 

199.19 200.88 A: and now like it would never work 

200.99 211.62 B: i see of course all right well that makes sense what do they do in the bachelor oh that's the one with the ridiculous roses and he gives a rose the one he wants to keep 

201.46 202.26 A: because now 

205.07 207.28 A: that's where they start with all the girls and like 

209.35 210.57 A: yeah 

211.05 212.39 A: but see the only reason (( )) 

212.64 216.06 A: i watched the first and then there was a girl that i was rooting for 

216.18 217.04 B: right 

216.67 222.88 A: so now i had to keep watching to see if she would get kicked out and of course she made it to the end but then she lost (( )) 

217.15 217.65 B: and 

218.45 219.57 B: to see 

222.65 223.28 B: right 

223.00 223.56 A: last one 

223.97 224.50 A: i think 

224.01 227.78 B: so in that is the idea that they're going to get married at the end 

227.68 228.19 A: that they're 

228.30 236.05 A: falling in love in front of our eyes it's so hokey and i'm so embarrassed and i think part of that i think 

236.73 238.39 A: reality t._v. has 

238.80 239.60 A: a tie 

240.10 243.66 A: i don't know it's associated with people who aren't intelligent in my opinion 

243.49 245.13 B: oh yeah definitely 

244.03 251.14 A: like i don't want to admit to people oh the bach- i'll be like yeah that show is ridiculous i i wonder who watches that 

251.42 256.42 A: and secretly here i am you know in front of my t._v. i have to watch it tonight 

261.28 263.21 A: maybe that's the draw 

261.78 263.87 B: i mean they're just bimbos 

263.56 267.85 A: maybe that's why it's so popular like i'll watch somebody whose got it way worse than me 

268.09 271.62 B: yeah yeah oh 

268.91 269.33 A: (( )) 

271.87 273.25 A: i think part of it there's always 

274.09 280.06 A: it's nice to see i guess the regular folk on t._v. like that guy he could live down the road from me 

277.77 278.36 B: yeah 

280.55 281.01 A: who knows 

281.05 282.17 B: yeah 

281.72 282.92 A: know like survivor 

283.04 285.31 A: it seems like they come from all walks of life 

285.89 287.15 B: yeah well that's true 

286.11 289.14 A: farmers business men military personnel 

289.36 290.18 A: it matters not 

293.64 295.06 A: it gets a demographic 

298.11 298.43 A: yeah 

299.63 300.74 A: (( )) 

300.57 306.84 B: this person's a single mother and that person's black and you know this person's gay and sort of 

302.40 302.72 A: yeah 

303.59 305.25 A: so everyone can identify 

306.99 307.28 A: yeah 

307.61 309.61 A: so everyone has someone that they can identify with 

309.61 310.82 B: yeah 

310.61 313.06 A: and i think the real world certainly on m._t._v. 

315.26 317.37 A: they pick people who will fight 

317.66 318.63 B: oh yeah 

318.21 323.41 A: they're not there just to be like oh look i bet these people will become best friends it's like oh no they need 

323.84 328.15 A: uh a highly racist individual and then you need someone who 

323.95 325.00 B: conflict 

325.26 325.78 B: yeah 

328.67 329.34 A: all that he will 

329.47 330.96 A: hate and loathe and will 

331.06 331.52 A: shout 

331.98 340.54 A: you know terrible obscenities at and then of course you need someone who was a christian person and then you need a homosexual and then they will argue about that 

332.30 332.92 B: yeah 

340.02 340.89 B: yeah 

340.70 341.34 A: they just ha- 

341.54 342.59 A: it breeds conflict 

342.85 350.16 B: yeah well i guess it's probably no different from any other prime time t._v. show you have to have a certain amount of tension 

347.49 347.89 A: yeah 

349.83 350.25 A: mhm 

350.35 352.79 B: um i don't know if these count as reality shows 

352.91 354.10 B: i guess they do but 

354.26 354.85 B: um 

355.48 361.07 B: i i watched a couple of episodes i forget what it was called but it it ran on t._b._s. and it 

360.76 361.95 A: going to your house 

361.78 363.17 B: i love that 

362.32 364.06 A: i love that show too 

364.02 366.85 B: that's my favorite i'm not interested in 

366.69 367.54 A: see this is 

366.95 370.66 B: twenty first century reality it's like the eighteen hundreds 

368.84 369.26 A: yeah 

370.48 372.61 A: but i think still they pick families who 

372.69 381.22 B: oh yeah you have the sulky teenager sixteen year old i need my friends i need the mall 

375.89 376.27 A: yes 

377.89 381.46 A: i need my make up oh i can't be- yes that's so funny 

381.45 385.47 B: i'm not going to wear that corset 

382.32 383.36 A: it certainly is 

386.07 388.93 B: corset is that how you say it yeah 

386.81 387.19 A: yeah 

388.46 390.25 A: but that is really funny 

389.63 394.56 B: no i like that i'm partly because i think when i was younger i i 

394.84 401.33 B: i really liked little house on the prairie and you know i just like thinking about living in those times and 

397.20 397.85 A: oh me too 

401.42 401.93 A: uh-huh 

402.62 403.28 B: and uh 

402.65 404.00 A: it's always interesting to s- 

404.10 404.54 A: see 

405.80 406.89 A: other people's 

407.01 407.52 A: view 

407.89 409.79 A: like if i watch it with a group of people 

410.14 411.29 A: some people take it 

411.41 412.53 A: so seriously 

412.96 414.03 A: some laugh at it 

414.34 415.13 A: you know and i'll 

415.29 418.16 A: i think what you were saying like you went over to your sister's house 

418.45 418.96 B: yeah 

418.80 420.44 A: and that is a way of life 

420.63 421.12 B: yeah 

420.76 423.14 A: it has truly engulfed some people 

422.76 424.41 B: yeah i mean i have to say i 

424.61 432.06 B: i don't watch a reality show on a regular basis but like my sister on thursday nights watches survivor my friends and i we watch the west wing 

432.11 433.99 A: oh i do enjoy the west wing 

432.30 433.60 B: you know which is our our 

433.82 435.76 B: our anti reality show 

436.29 437.47 B: so 

437.32 441.07 A: i think part of me when i watch television i want to be impressed 

441.48 444.16 A: i never watch boston public because i'm a teacher 

444.71 449.89 A: and i just feel like that's what i do everyday and i don't need to watch it on television because those are the same kids that 

449.64 450.31 B: yeah 

450.16 451.63 A: you know i argue and fight with 

452.24 453.08 B: yeah 

452.65 455.42 A: about those same issues with other faculty members 

455.53 456.30 A: but i 

456.59 457.58 A: am addicted to 

456.72 458.44 B: you want escape from reality 

458.14 464.87 A: yes i want to watch law and order something that i i don't do i feel like i could never do any of the things on that show 

464.17 464.63 B: yeah 

465.19 465.58 A: um 

465.94 468.42 A: so i like to watch things that i feel i 

468.83 471.63 A: won't accomplish and so it gives me a little eye 

472.88 473.87 A: into something that 

474.69 477.73 A: i'm not familiar with so maybe that's why i buy into like e._r. 

478.02 478.69 B: oh right 

478.04 479.57 A: it's because i don't know what it's like 

479.99 481.77 B: yeah i definitely 

480.71 481.41 A: and so 

481.61 485.03 A: when i i don't know i have lots of friends that went through premed 

485.64 486.25 A: and now 

486.54 491.73 A: they're working in hospitals and they laugh they're like i can't sit through e._r. that's so hokey 

491.67 492.54 B: yeah 

492.37 494.25 A: and for me you know that's boston public 

494.62 496.56 A: i can't i don't think it's realistic 

497.00 497.45 B: right 

497.21 498.13 A: for me not enough 

498.57 499.76 B: yeah 

499.11 499.44 A: so 

500.32 501.92 A: i think reality t._v. 

502.33 503.85 A: it's such an ironic title 

504.15 504.84 A: it's not 

504.22 504.75 B: right 

505.22 506.52 A: realistic at 

506.79 507.16 A: all
