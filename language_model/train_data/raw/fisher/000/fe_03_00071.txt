0.29 1.50 A: hi 

1.41 2.58 B: hi 

2.75 3.68 A: um 

2.82 4.23 B: this is saskia 

4.46 9.53 A: hi oh i think i spoke to you before and then we got disconnected yes 

7.29 10.51 B: oh is this adrienne [laughter] 

9.62 10.96 A: how are you doing 

11.08 14.31 B: good i hope i hope we uh last [laughter] 

13.31 26.54 A: yeah you know what the last time i had them on my cellphone and um i told them to change it to my regular phone because i don't think my cellphone hung up on 'em but their system has to detect a constant signal 

26.72 30.02 A: you know that's why like if you use like caller i._d. it doesn't work 

30.02 31.55 B: (( mm okay )) 

30.27 38.63 A: so i think that my phone faded and their system hung up on me that's my theory but it doesn't really matter because now i think it'll be okay 

34.25 35.47 B: (( oh okay )) 

38.85 42.44 B: okay i'm all oh we better talk about the thing [laughter] 

41.57 43.33 A: [laughter] 

42.52 44.84 B: so do you watch any reality shows 

44.83 46.04 A: um 

46.51 54.13 A: i don't watch anything really frequently but i i like those kind of shows i like like the survivor and fear factor kind of ones where they're doing like 

54.63 60.52 A: like i don't know you know sort of not dangerous but like things that i wouldn't necessarily do [mn] 

60.71 61.68 B: (( [mn] )) 

62.07 65.54 B: um why do you think you like those or why do you think people like those 

66.02 67.01 A: um 

67.02 70.64 A: i don't know to me it's like cooler than watching like um 

71.03 76.99 A: whatever like fictional t._v. because like there are a lot of things that aren't really exciting because it's just an illusion 

77.32 78.49 B: mhm 

77.47 84.72 A: like like i like watching like fear factor kind of stuff because they're actually having to do it whereas if it's like in a movie they probably aren't actually doing it 

85.10 98.05 B: huh yeah i haven't go- you know i haven't i haven't watched either of those shows i never watched survivor and i didn't watch fear factor but i've seen the commercials and it looks interesting i've only watched like what's that 

94.90 96.62 A: do you watch any other ones 

97.44 99.22 A: do you watch any other um 

99.64 102.45 B: i have actually watched um 

102.48 103.96 B: a couple like 

104.81 109.75 B: where the parents take your date and that actually was pretty fascinating 

107.17 108.19 A: mhm 

109.85 113.79 B: uh and i watched the original one the m._t._v. 

114.03 115.28 B: (( whatever it is )) 

114.59 115.91 A: oh the real world 

115.97 118.23 B: yeah the real world um 

118.47 126.90 B: and it's in generally in general it's kind of disappointing but i find myself watching it 'cause yeah because it's real and because 

127.03 129.36 B: you know i i think people 

129.41 132.47 B: are definitely interested in 

132.76 137.22 B: in understanding like how the human mind works you know and the ethos 

136.05 137.20 A: yeah 

137.29 139.07 B: that's par- part of it 

138.79 142.50 A: do you feel like when you watch these shows like it's actually realistic 

143.35 144.28 B: um 

144.44 145.43 B: (( no )) 

145.45 148.42 B: because it's all edited you know 

145.58 146.97 A: (( no [mn] )) 

148.59 159.73 B: like i do i do on some level and then i in a lot of times like if i watched the m._t._v. real world show i'm just like oh life sucks because it's so banal banal it's like so 

148.65 149.68 A: yeah 

154.31 155.38 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

159.08 160.36 A: yeah 

160.30 164.98 B: bottom of the rung [mn] as far as the ways we can interact with each other 

165.07 166.53 B: um it's 

165.22 166.38 A: yeah 

166.57 167.44 B: (( [noise] )) 

166.69 179.31 A: i sort of i find it like amazing that those people were so obnoxious and mean and like rude to each other when they knew they were on t._v. because i would think that like if i were being videotaped i couldn't be like that 

176.50 177.50 B: (( [mn] )) 

179.32 188.16 A: obnoxious because i would be like thinking about the fact that i was being videotaped and i wonder sometimes if they did it like on purpose so that people would remember them almost 

184.33 185.21 B: oh really 

188.04 190.75 B: [laughter] right yeah 

189.70 191.82 A: 'cause like we all remember puck right 

192.20 193.82 B: [laughter] 

192.71 197.40 A: like he was like the most obnoxious person ever to be on the real world and that's like his claim to fame 

196.38 197.55 B: oh wait who 

197.47 198.44 A: puck 

198.51 199.58 A: wasn't it maybe 

199.04 203.53 B: oh you know what i do remember that name though i yeah i'm not a big fan though 

201.85 203.51 A: you don't remember why 

203.66 205.83 B: yeah [laughter] 

204.35 207.21 A: well see he got exactly what he wanted 

207.37 211.83 A: he got to be famous for that having people remember that he was a like a jerk [laughter] 

207.53 208.48 B: wow 

211.58 214.20 B: [laughter] that's funny 

214.50 215.43 B: wow 

215.61 217.44 B: (( what did he look like i'm always )) 

217.37 220.32 A: [laughter] wha- what do i look like 

220.22 222.12 B: [laughter] no what did puck look like 

221.34 229.31 A: (( what did he l- oh okay i was like um he had sort of like funky blond hair sort of like spikyish )) 

223.69 224.68 B: (( it gets worse )) 

229.64 230.76 A: um 

230.86 233.51 A: he had like an eyebrow ring i think 

233.90 234.57 B: (( mm mm )) 

235.45 240.18 A: and he made like all these guest appearances on other shows after his real world was over 

236.28 236.84 B: (( [mn] )) 

240.38 243.57 B: oh that's 'cause his real world was over that's 

240.60 242.14 A: just like everybody like 

242.75 249.20 A: yeah [laughter] he's back in our fake world now and he's making t._v. appearances 

243.88 245.58 B: [laughter] 

248.83 252.03 B: [laughter] wow interesting 

251.86 252.94 A: um 

252.40 255.52 B: yeah i i don't know i mean i think 

256.17 262.36 B: i think probably the participants are confused about what real world is you know at that level 

260.97 266.37 A: yeah definitely like i didn't feel like very many of those people seemed to have like 

266.77 270.24 A: an intelligent seeming perspective on what they were doing 

270.71 275.99 A: like some of the shows um i'm trying to think like they had something called the mole for a while 

276.27 278.45 A: where it was like an actual game 

278.51 287.55 A: where like you were there with like twenty people and somebody is the spy and like isn't really playing the same game as everyone else and you're supposed to try to figure out who it is 

284.80 285.55 B: (( [mn] )) 

287.34 297.59 A: and that seemed like cool because the people there were all like no you know i'm just here to play the game and you can't trust anyone because like that's the whole game but it's a game and we're trying to win money and that seemed like 

297.64 299.82 A: i don't know realistic to me 

300.33 301.73 B: [mn] right 

301.79 304.06 B: interesting realistic like 

304.15 307.88 A: well it didn't seem like those people had forgotten that they were on t._v. 

308.25 309.50 B: right 

309.80 311.55 B: i see what you mean mhm 

311.72 317.24 B: although there's also what is that what is that other one there's real world and then there's that one 

317.50 318.82 B: road 

319.72 320.82 A: oh 

319.72 320.63 B: rule 

321.12 322.29 A: yeah 

321.50 325.33 B: i'm not i kinda like those ones i like that one because 

325.87 331.83 A: yeah roa- yeah that's the same kind of thing like the mole where there's like an actual game going on something that they actually have to do 

331.93 334.08 B: yeah and then they actually 

334.16 340.87 B: you know have more of a chance for friendship it still gets kind of dramatic when they're all disappointed in each other for failing or whatever [mn] 

340.38 341.75 A: yeah 

341.17 343.67 B: (( and then they like film them aside [mn] )) 

344.45 348.03 B: i don't know i have really mixed feelings about reality television 

348.84 349.89 B: um 

350.83 352.04 B: yeah 

352.99 355.50 B: just because it's because 

356.49 360.43 B: it's just because of the authenticity of it that's for sure 

361.54 364.05 A: um like you think it isn't 

361.61 362.17 B: (( [mn] )) 

364.32 369.17 B: i i think that it's just really mixed and that you can't really tell 

369.46 370.75 B: on some level 

371.05 372.24 A: yeah 

372.65 380.82 A: i think that like even if they're trying to make it like reality like there's no way that there's nobody who's going to act exactly the same way 

372.74 373.70 B: (( because mhm mhm )) 

380.98 392.23 A: when they know somebody's taking a picture as they would if they were really like quote unquote in their real lives so i don't think that it's possible to have like true reality television 

392.93 404.06 B: yeah or mayb- i mean maybe they get numb to it but like especially like all those bed scenes like come on [laughter] and i'm like all the bed scenes like it's just sick 

396.19 397.11 A: yeah 

399.19 400.61 A: w- what scenes 

401.58 402.79 A: yeah 

403.93 404.64 A: (( [mn] )) 

404.21 407.32 B: [laughter] yeah okay [laughter] 

406.67 415.36 A: well like that's what like they to tried to do with the truman show they tried to show like what it would be like if somebody actually didn't like know i guess did you see the truman show 

414.46 416.64 B: [mn] yeah it was great 

416.38 418.04 A: yeah i really like that 

418.89 419.96 A: um 

419.29 419.97 B: (( mm )) 

421.64 424.93 A: i thought that was really like interesting 'cause like i don't think 

425.06 430.56 A: i mean i don't know it's sort of like cool but like i think a lot of people would be really creeped out if that were actually going on 

430.85 434.17 A: we just wanna see like something that's like almost real [mn] 

434.21 436.85 B: [laughter] oh [noise] 

435.33 439.00 A: well i wouldn't wanna watch a show where it was really somebody's life like that would 

439.48 440.39 A: (( i don't know )) 

439.61 446.84 B: i'd probably end up watching it but i'd be horrified by it but the truth is is that i probably would watch it [laughter] 

443.06 444.28 A: yeah 

446.30 457.33 A: i'd probably watch it like to see what it was like but i i think it would like bother me to watch it much because like if you start getting attached to the person if you start like liking the person then you'd feel so bad for them 

447.68 448.24 B: (( [noise] )) 

448.30 448.94 B: [laughter] 

451.70 453.84 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

457.32 458.40 B: yeah 

457.72 460.08 A: that like they have that life 

460.35 461.42 B: totally 

462.63 471.22 B: [mn] yeah it would be really weird it would be like [laughter] com- there'd be like [mn] guilty addicts to the show [laughter] 

469.74 471.19 A: [laughter] 

472.15 473.05 B: huh 

473.73 477.98 B: yeah reality television it's funny 'cause i've always wanted to um 

478.60 487.80 B: do i love documentary work and i've always wanted to document like if i have kids and like really document that but i've started to realize like wow 

489.10 496.07 B: the dangers of it and um because when they're little they don't know and they're not self conscious so if you grew up with a camera 

490.59 491.62 A: yeah 

496.16 497.23 B: then 

496.71 498.47 A: yeah that's totally true 

498.36 508.43 B: you know well that you like it and then also it's really important for kids to have privacy too so and and anonymity so i don't know um 

504.86 505.86 A: yeah 

508.37 512.94 A: yeah my parents have a lot of videos of me as a little kid and like 

513.12 521.76 A: most of it's like fine but like i know they have pictures of me like pretty much naked that they've like shown to their friends and i'm like you know i know i'm a little kid but that's a little weird 

522.45 523.15 B: (( hm )) 

522.82 523.96 A: [mn] but you 

524.28 529.54 A: i'm like three i'm not like a baby like i've still got i've got all the parts you know 

529.28 531.47 B: (( [laughter] mm )) 

530.29 531.27 A: [mn] 

532.29 542.71 B: yeah i don't know but i at the same time it's like i think it probably comes from partly 'cause i have hardly any photographs or anything i don't have any video footage at all so 

542.14 544.51 A: of like yourself as a little kid 

543.74 548.49 B: mhm yeah so it's like gosh i i'd love to have a 

546.66 548.28 A: yeah 

548.51 549.77 B: picture of me 

548.91 550.63 A: it is definitely fun 

549.82 550.56 B: (( nude )) 

550.71 551.99 A: to watch 

552.26 553.17 B: mhm 

552.98 553.98 A: um 

555.23 556.45 B: but i wouldn't 

555.25 561.79 A: especially 'cause you just totally don't remember at all what being that age is like it's like watching somebody else 

562.28 572.25 A: actually like i recently watched a video of myself as a little kid and i didn't understand something i'd said like i didn't understand like what i meant and my brother actually figured out what i was talking about it 

572.29 581.49 A: was just funny that like i was watching me and i was like what the hell do i mean by that [mn] and then my brother's like i think you meant like bubble car and i was like oh 

572.39 573.45 B: oh wow 

576.61 577.62 B: [laughter] 

581.61 582.35 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

582.00 582.90 B: wow 

582.37 584.90 A: it was sort of like strange 

585.23 592.10 B: yeah 'cause well the thing about that's the thing so like because the camera can totally give you insight right 

592.06 593.14 A: yeah 

592.25 597.76 B: into what it is to be human but it's weird with reality shows because 

598.36 603.03 B: i don't think it's very effective [laughter] 

601.45 603.70 A: yeah yeah that's true 

603.96 608.65 A: i think they've gotten sort of like carried away with making so many different like versions of like 

609.12 623.48 A: the reality shows i think that that happens like a lot with like genres of t._v. shows and then like all of a sudden like they just sort of scale it down and it's back to like the original and 'cause like how many reality shows could you possibly watch 

619.42 620.51 B: mhm 

624.67 634.96 B: right well there's a lot of uh it's weird to hear there's a lot of other countries doing the reality shows like stranger weirder versions [laughter] 

634.52 636.39 A: really that's really funny 

635.99 641.97 B: yeah i think like in russia there was a just a woman's life and it was like everything 

642.71 643.70 B: everything 

643.60 644.96 A: like one woman 

645.10 646.19 B: mhm 

647.24 649.39 A: like the uh the osbournes 

649.76 653.58 B: oh yeah i [mn] do actually like that show [laughter] 

652.74 653.87 A: (( do you )) 

653.98 657.82 B: i do [laughter] i a lot 

655.63 657.91 A: i've never really watched it i don't 

657.98 661.86 A: know enough about the osbournes to appreciate it 

662.05 667.02 B: i didn't really know much about them either i mean i know about ozzie but 

666.63 667.79 A: yeah 

667.24 669.41 B: but it but it's um 

670.09 674.03 B: i don't know it's sort of reminds me of my family in some weird way 

674.48 675.87 A: (( okay [noise] )) 

675.82 677.29 B: ozzie osbourne 

677.58 678.49 B: um 

680.01 686.26 B: it's weird i don't know why i like it and it's kind of boring but it's kind of weird it's like 

686.91 690.42 B: it's weird because if you have a reality show 

690.50 700.27 B: in some regard and you turn it on and it's not particularly exciting or dramatic it's almost like you're they're in your living room [mn] or something it's really weird 

698.66 699.81 A: yeah 

700.53 702.16 B: i don't know i like 

700.81 702.38 A: yeah it is really weird 

703.46 710.36 B: i guess i guess i like it because they're alternative and um feels embarrassing to say there's a lot 

710.38 711.01 A: [mn] 

710.67 713.53 B: (( but it's just like it's got you know )) 

713.66 716.51 B: rock star dad you know 

715.87 719.96 A: yeah i know of cour- it's definitely like it's interesting because you're watching like 

716.77 718.35 B: being regular
