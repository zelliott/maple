59.83 60.50 B: mhm 

60.40 61.93 A: yeah that's what we're saying 

61.96 65.88 B: yeah i mean you know if you're just overeating or you know that 

65.87 69.77 A: yeah that's only within oneself 

67.78 75.87 B: unless unless you've eaten all the food in the house and then no one else has any food but other than that 

72.15 72.73 A: mhm 

76.07 82.76 B: and then i guess what would be the if we were to go and order what would be the next one 

76.89 78.22 A: yeah 

82.64 86.56 A: mmm well i think it maybe drinking alcohol 

86.28 86.85 B: yeah 

86.79 88.10 A: yeah cause sometimes 

88.24 90.85 A: people will act very differently when they 

91.20 92.91 A: drink alcohol 

92.26 93.20 B: yeah 

93.32 97.84 A: yeah it's also because they will effect um other people so 

97.64 98.26 B: yeah 

98.34 99.00 B: yeah 

98.95 100.40 A: i will consider that's more 

100.62 103.53 A: um that's worse than the the other habits 

105.43 105.92 B: yeah 

105.96 106.40 A: well 

107.63 112.09 B: and then uh yeah because well with alcohol i mean if you are 

113.04 113.68 B: um 

114.09 116.27 B: moderate and if you 

115.36 115.94 A: mhm 

116.07 119.02 A: or you just drink it at home by yourself 

117.56 122.44 B: right you know that's fine but if you get in a car and drive of if you 

122.55 124.55 B: start doing stupid things then 

123.85 125.66 A: yeah that's really bad 

125.22 126.39 B: yeah 

127.08 129.28 A: um so 

128.75 130.35 B: and then overeating and 

130.44 141.48 B: under exercising well they're bad but i don't think they're um at the top of the list i think they're more 

140.98 143.37 A: mhm so what do you think about gossiping 

143.98 147.89 B: oh i forgot about gossiping geez 

148.28 151.19 B: um gossiping i think 

151.89 155.81 B: um i i really think it's important not to talk 

156.50 158.27 B: badly about other people 

157.12 157.85 A: mhm 

158.19 158.99 A: yeah 

158.68 160.17 B: but at the same time 

160.51 162.30 B: you know if there's news 

162.55 163.03 A: mhm 

162.73 163.28 B: then 

163.67 165.62 B: i think gossip can actually 

165.85 168.26 B: be a good thing because you can 

168.79 169.31 B: form 

170.05 171.65 B: friendships and bonds 

171.42 172.11 A: mhm 

171.83 173.66 B: you know by sharing gossip 

172.93 173.74 A: yeah 

174.61 175.74 B: as long as it's not 

174.67 177.51 A: so it depends on the the context 

177.27 180.53 B: right right as long as it's not you know 

180.96 183.25 B: untrue or malicious 

183.28 183.97 A: mhm 

183.55 184.21 B: you know 

185.02 186.03 A: yeah as long as (( )) 

185.31 185.71 B: so 

186.25 189.24 A: uh the thing you're talking about is true 

189.35 191.73 A: i think that's okay for gossiping 

191.40 192.10 B: mhm 

192.22 194.92 A: yeah but if you're trying to make up something 

195.06 195.45 A: that's 

195.91 196.42 A: that's not 

196.84 198.51 A: real or um 

198.97 200.82 A: or really hurt other people 

201.15 202.65 A: yeah maybe that's bad habit 

202.66 203.33 B: yeah 

203.46 203.98 B: yeah 

204.45 205.33 A: yeah 

205.58 206.42 A: and uh 

207.13 210.85 A: oh the other one is um caffeine excessively 

211.30 212.47 B: oh i don't think that's a 

213.05 213.88 B: big deal 

213.68 214.34 A: mhm 

214.18 216.88 B: you know i i d- you know it's probably not 

214.74 215.36 A: yeah 

217.79 220.47 B: very healthy for you but um 

218.08 218.75 A: excuse me 

219.34 219.95 A: mhm 

221.17 224.71 B: you know i don't think that that's a big problem 

224.48 225.26 A: yeah i think they're 

225.55 229.14 A: it is just like overeating or not exercising 

228.36 229.94 B: yeah mhm 

229.92 231.02 A: yeah 

234.26 235.16 B: and i don't have 

235.83 237.46 B: any of those problems nope 

237.62 241.21 A: oh that's good 

243.21 248.08 A: well i think i i seldom do exercise but 

249.07 254.10 A: well i i i'm not a beast or yeah but i think that's 

251.68 252.33 B: mhm 

254.35 259.53 A: okay and i i didn't 

259.78 260.19 A: i 

260.50 263.75 A: do or do not exercise yeah i think it's just 

262.31 262.88 B: mhm 

264.15 265.52 A: a matter of time because 

265.99 267.26 A: sometimes i i (( )) 

267.64 269.13 A: they deal with other things or 

269.38 270.05 B: right 

269.86 272.61 A: and didn't think about doing exercise 

272.08 272.76 B: mhm 

272.71 273.17 A: yeah 

273.15 275.42 B: mhm yeah i mean um 

276.96 282.61 B: well i probably i i go through phases there are times where i'm really very good about 

282.74 286.42 B: watching what i eat and not eating too much and 

284.09 284.74 A: mhm 

286.53 288.23 B: exercising and then 

288.71 292.37 B: it seems when i'm really busy or if i'm really tired 

292.13 292.77 A: mhm 

292.79 294.27 B: i tend to 

294.64 299.03 B: not exercise and maybe eat more or eat more of the wrong thing 

295.80 296.71 A: yeah 

298.37 300.63 A: yeah maybe you need more energy 

300.52 301.56 B: right 

301.21 301.65 A: yeah 

302.01 311.59 B: then the caffeine i i really hardly ever drink more than one or two cups of coffee and that's it i can't drink too much more than that otherwise 

311.47 311.98 A: mhm 

311.92 313.52 B: i get really jittery 

313.56 314.64 A: oh 

313.70 314.12 B: so 

314.85 319.93 B: and i don't drink coffee after uh noon either because it'll keep me up 

318.54 319.11 A: mhm 

320.14 321.33 A: yeah 

321.36 322.00 B: so 

322.44 324.60 B: unless i really have to and then 

324.61 325.12 A: yeah 

326.11 329.44 A: i think i like to drink coffee but um i didn't 

326.27 326.75 B: (( )) 

329.79 334.48 A: form the habit of drinking coffee every day or like you know every morning 

334.62 334.99 A: yeah 

335.31 336.00 A: and and i 

336.21 337.52 A: i think it i- it is um 

338.10 345.26 A: special thing for me because uh every time i drink coffee i fa- i fall asleep very easily yeah 

342.80 344.38 B: yeah oh really 

345.14 345.80 B: huh 

345.66 347.70 A: and even if i drink espresso 

347.80 348.28 B: yeah 

347.82 349.22 A: i still fall asleep 

348.93 351.78 B: i have a friend who's like that she um 

352.32 354.61 B: she actually goes out and 

354.98 356.40 B: gets an espresso 

356.29 356.82 A: mhm 

357.05 361.73 B: as like her bed time drink like to make her go to sleep 

359.86 360.91 A: oh 

361.75 362.91 A: mhm 

362.78 371.93 B: and that i just don't understand but oh well i don't think it's it's too bad one way or the other so 

365.88 367.90 A: yeah 

371.28 371.98 A: mhm 

372.70 373.31 A: yeah 

373.63 376.08 B: in fact i think there was a recent study that 

376.21 376.94 B: said 

377.19 380.10 B: that drinking caffeine actually has some benefits 

380.42 381.07 A: mhm 

380.67 386.54 B: uh i can't remember exactly what they were though since i don't drink that much coffee so um 

385.26 385.84 A: mhm 

386.28 386.80 A: yeah 

387.08 391.26 B: there was or other caffeinated drinks i guess it's more than just coffee 

391.36 391.97 A: mhm 

392.21 393.03 B: but um 

394.12 396.60 A: so maybe drinking coffee once in a while 

396.83 397.74 A: not is not a 

397.98 399.01 A: bad thing 

399.19 399.57 A: yeah 

399.27 399.81 B: right 

400.20 405.56 A: yeah but if you- if you're drinking coffee all the time from from morning to 

406.10 409.10 A: the evening maybe they got to be a little bit excessive 

409.41 409.98 B: yeah 

410.34 410.93 B: yeah 

411.14 414.54 B: someone i know said uh everything in moderation 

414.63 415.04 B: and that's 

415.41 416.00 B: you know 

416.68 417.21 B: i think the 

417.32 418.56 B: words to go by 

418.71 419.44 A: yeah 

419.68 422.49 B: whether it's coffee alcohol food 

423.09 424.50 B: exercise you know just 

425.39 426.68 B: every a little bit 

426.90 427.44 A: mhm 

427.28 427.83 B: you know 

428.06 429.11 B: in moderation 

429.27 429.61 B: so 

429.32 429.79 A: yeah 

431.23 431.92 B: anyway 

434.40 435.80 A: so 

436.14 436.69 A: i think we're 

437.22 438.87 A: finishing the topic 

438.60 440.29 B: yeah i think so 

440.07 440.66 A: yeah 

440.75 441.23 B: yeah 

441.41 442.95 B: unless you have something else to 

443.23 443.78 A: mhm 

443.67 444.61 B: add to it 

446.86 449.26 A: well so far i can't think of 

449.42 450.88 A: anything to add 

451.27 453.05 B: so we covered all of them right 

452.63 453.42 A: yeah 

453.28 453.92 B: okay 

454.79 455.42 B: gossip 

455.64 456.43 B: exercise 

456.69 461.51 B: yeah gossip's a funny thing i really really really try hard not to say 

461.84 465.31 B: you know if i know it was something bad that happened i don't 

463.81 464.58 A: mhm 

465.82 466.55 B: really 

467.33 472.45 B: find it you know something i want to talk about but if it's good news or if it's 

473.13 476.38 B: something that i'm curious about then i may 

474.74 477.01 A: mhm or something positive 

477.18 481.65 B: yeah or you know oh i here so and so is getting married you know i mean 

480.78 481.71 A: yeah 

482.22 484.88 A: that'll be a good habit for gossiping 

482.23 482.81 B: so 

483.66 486.65 B: yeah exactly 

486.85 493.60 B: or sometimes if i need to like if i hear something and i need to tell someone i'll tell someone who is 

492.19 492.70 A: mmm 

494.39 500.67 B: like far away from the situation who doesn't know who doesn't know the people involved or 

496.99 497.52 A: mhm 

500.17 500.93 A: oh 

500.89 505.79 B: who would never meet the people involved you know like my mom or something like that 

502.86 503.46 A: mhm 

505.08 506.07 A: yeah 

506.47 509.17 B: so cause she doesn't really you know 

509.31 517.76 B: pay much attention anyway but i feel like once i've said it then i feel like i've gotten it out so 

510.79 512.87 A: mhm 

517.31 518.44 A: yeah 

517.94 518.49 B: you know 

518.90 523.80 A: and sometimes you you will get some advice from those people you talk to 
522.41 524.98 B: right yeah mhm 

524.46 526.58 A: yeah and might be a good thing though 

526.74 527.34 B: yeah 

528.04 528.80 A: yeah 

528.71 534.15 B: so um are you a participant in the study at at the school 

534.12 535.38 A: um yeah 

535.37 536.00 B: okay 

536.06 537.23 A: yeah sort of 

537.23 537.74 B: so
