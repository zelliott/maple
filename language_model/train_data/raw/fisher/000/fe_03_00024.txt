120.02 120.58 A: uh-huh 

122.91 123.29 B: (( )) 

124.14 124.97 B: exactly like

127.35 127.92 A: mhm 

130.59 131.93 B: actually don't walk with 

132.37 136.70 B: like your shoes in the snow um i don't know where you're from but you know 

136.86 137.30 B: it's like 

137.99 147.33 B: just common sense protect yourself from the cold if it is cold outside um i think you have less chances of uh of being sick 

139.66 140.20 A: yeah

149.89 150.52 A: um 

151.08 155.02 B: and you know if people work in a a very social environment i 

155.18 159.03 B: you know even if they do take a lot of precaut- precautions they might um 

159.33 164.22 B: they get might get si- sick sick um no matter what because they're in contact with other 

164.32 165.07 B: sick people

173.93 175.10 B: oh that's nice 

175.04 184.39 A: yeah i don't have that problem i think that for a lot of people sickness has to do with their their attitude and whether they think they are really going to get sick

314.75 315.25 A: don't 

315.90 317.55 A: heat their homes at all 

317.97 320.02 A: in fact some of them just leave their 

318.74 321.43 B: (( )) to get t- t- to build their immune system 

321.59 330.05 A: well yeah it's it's like sixty degrees outside and they've got their doors open and their babies are just kind of bundled up in their little 

330.41 333.06 A: eh places there in their living rooms and

339.26 345.90 A: i wouldn't i don't know i- i actually didn't notice i- i didn't meet a lot of people who were sick but 

346.78 349.72 A: it didn't it didn't seem to make a whole lot of difference to me 

349.81 353.19 B: oh yeah i mean i guess i guess we all have our little myths 

353.32 354.61 B: myths about um 

355.30 355.83 B: about 

356.13 357.49 A: about what makes you sick 

356.64 361.38 B: health and yeah just like the whole you know g- g- grandmother's

368.92 371.30 B: they have these home remedies that 

371.42 372.08 B: don't really 

372.46 377.45 B: work i guess i guess they don't really work scientifically but they make you feel better 

378.04 380.89 A: y- you know that's a good point i noticed that eh 

381.49 392.37 A: that i've never read anything about this or anything but i noticed that if i start to get sick if i eat a lot of sugars then i tend to get sicker but if i stay away from sugar it 

388.71 389.06 B: mhm 

392.68 393.60 A: it i don't get 

393.74 394.02 A: sick 

394.20 395.22 A: quite so easily 

395.51 395.98 B: hm 

396.53 398.69 A: especially with a sore throat 

398.35 400.70 B: sick m- meaning like a cold or a flu 

401.06 401.67 A: um 

402.29 404.79 A: flu not so much but definitely a cold 

405.12 405.74 B: really 

405.86 407.71 A: if i stay away from sugar then 

408.04 410.71 B: it might have to do with the immune system i don't know 

410.73 411.41 A: it could 

411.61 414.57 B: ther- but tha- tha- there's definitely a lot of feel good 

414.81 415.25 B: um 

415.62 416.23 B: foods 

416.50 417.43 B: you like like 

417.38 417.75 A: uh-huh 

417.70 418.20 B: good old 

418.34 419.47 B: chicken soup 

419.51 420.05 A: uh-huh 

420.07 421.98 B: chicken noodle soup you know who 

422.78 424.80 B: i mean i think that everybody in the world 

425.09 426.91 B: or ever- everybody in america just 

428.04 430.28 B: as soon as they get a cold they have 

430.77 432.38 B: they have hot tea or 

432.48 432.85 B: or 

433.10 433.75 B: or hot 

433.13 433.62 A: (( )) 

434.24 435.72 B: chicken noodle soup 

435.77 438.83 A: you know i crave hot things when i get sick especially 

439.03 440.64 A: not even necessarily w- 

440.85 442.76 A: eh (( warms )) but 

442.91 449.27 A: just hotness so whenever i get a sore throat or a cold i really really crave salsa 

449.93 450.69 B: salsa 

450.45 452.07 A: isn't that funny 

451.86 453.08 B: and peppers and stuff 

453.12 455.82 A: yeah salsa and ah just hot things 

453.69 454.21 B: wow 

454.56 455.36 B: well y- 

455.92 456.64 B: you know what 

456.74 457.38 B: i i 

457.54 460.74 B: i do think that that it would make sense because it 

461.17 462.48 B: it makes you sweat 

462.87 463.69 A: yeah 

463.32 471.59 B: so you know it it probably gets rid of a whole lot of things w- (( )) if you if you take um a hot bath 

464.39 465.04 A: that's true 

472.39 472.90 A: uh-huh 

472.80 473.87 B: you know you you 

474.04 478.59 B: you take a hot bath you sweat and then you sort of feel better 

478.72 483.89 A: that's a good point maybe that's why excersi- or one of the reasons why exercise feels so good 

484.08 485.57 B: and drinking a lot of water 

486.43 487.33 A: good point 

487.09 487.71 B: you know 

488.36 488.92 B: yeah 

489.17 490.59 A: (( )) 

489.67 491.33 B: well i think we got it there 

491.94 495.09 B: (( wha-hoo )) well there you go 

494.56 496.32 A: great um 

496.49 502.16 A: have you have you ever tried to or nursed a child through sickness or

504.54 504.87 B: no 

508.35 509.02 B: oh that's cool 

509.06 514.20 A: that's one of the things that kind of makes me nervous i don't know how to take care of a child when it's sick 

515.78 518.44 B: so obviously it's your it's your first child 

517.98 520.41 A: yeah 

518.65 519.30 B: um 

519.97 521.40 B: well i mean they have 

523.15 527.91 B: doctors probably like pediatricians probably have like like good remedies 

528.13 528.57 A: yeah 

528.54 531.44 B: i know there's a th- th- a thing called uh pedia- 

531.69 532.21 B: um 

532.40 533.65 B: what is it pedialyte 

533.88 534.29 A: uh-huh 

534.47 537.78 B: something like that that's like it's basically electrolyte 

538.10 538.48 A: huh 

538.21 541.83 B: you know how when you sick when your sick they tell you to drink um 

542.07 542.78 B: de-
