206.31 206.75 A: got you 

206.78 207.36 B: what do you do 

207.70 208.74 A: i'm a real estate broker 

209.01 209.27 B: oh 

210.13 210.49 A: so 

210.84 213.40 A: it's a slow day in the real estate business but 

214.33 216.16 A: i have a lot of plenty of paper work to do so 

216.74 217.56 B: how old are you 

218.38 219.62 A: thirty four 

219.40 219.99 B: thirty four 

221.33 222.02 A: and yourself 

221.90 222.62 B: twenty four 

226.58 227.96 A: mhm 

228.85 229.37 A: well 

229.89 231.46 A: what are we three minutes into this 

231.53 234.57 B: um my phone actually records it we're almost five minutes actually 

234.89 235.39 A: okay 

235.20 237.35 B: well since the guy called me the computer guy called me 

237.96 238.80 A: yeah (( )) 

239.92 242.86 A: the probably that was probably simultaneous when they did the uh 

242.93 244.69 B: they just call everybody and then figure out 

243.06 243.80 A: introduction 

245.12 246.87 B: how to connect everybody or something like that 

247.28 249.73 A: so do you do you have any idea what what 

249.91 252.43 A: is behind this program what are they doing what kind of 

252.10 253.64 B: my guess is something with 

254.03 255.42 B: where you're from and 

255.60 256.02 B: different 

256.46 257.87 B: speech patterns or something like that 

258.82 261.17 B: but what's the company that you heard about it through what do they do 

258.88 259.63 A: got you 

262.15 262.73 A: um 

263.30 266.89 A: well my my friend works for the government he works at (( nist )) 

267.17 267.62 B: mhm 

268.12 269.39 A: and he's in the uh 

269.72 271.38 A: automated speech recognition 

271.50 272.10 A: division 

272.02 274.58 B: oh okay i bet it's something with that then 

272.23 272.82 A: i think 

275.20 276.25 A: that would make sense 

275.87 278.84 B: because see my friend works for the linguistics data consortium and they do 

279.18 280.05 B: things like that 

280.16 281.43 A: and that's who turned you on to this 

281.88 282.40 B: what 

282.68 284.33 A: that's how you found out about the survey 

283.47 284.08 B: yeah 

284.37 286.62 B: because when i used to work there we did stuff with um 

284.64 285.08 A: got you 

287.12 291.17 B: we'd read news articles and we'd try and figure out what the main topic in the news article was 

292.00 294.50 B: um and the idea was they were trying to figure out 

294.65 297.31 B: if software could be just as good as humans 

297.98 302.13 B: so you'd read an article and say like is it on the topic of you know the war on iraq or something like that 

298.07 298.62 A: got you 

302.37 303.00 B: and 

302.71 303.14 A: got you 

303.72 303.98 B: some 

304.12 305.89 A: so what's your favorite restaurant in new york 

304.38 305.13 B: (( )) 

306.70 307.22 B: restaurant 

307.56 308.15 B: um 

308.39 309.50 B: there's a place called r- 

308.80 310.11 A: what's your favorite type of food 

310.58 311.83 B: well my favorite 

312.07 317.20 B: i like a lot of different kinds of food there's this restaurant called roy's new york and they actually have a few of them around the country i think 

317.29 317.71 B: um 

317.89 318.60 B: which is sort of like 

321.90 322.42 A: okay 

325.99 332.06 B: and once i had a bad experience and complained about it and then i got a fifty dollar coupon the next time so then they started to 

332.27 335.90 B: finding things to (( complain )) about it's like a deal um 

333.98 334.82 A: no way 

336.23 339.12 B: and actually i just finished a project at work and they said we could 

339.73 344.20 B: do something to celebrate i guess so my coworker and i went there and spent like 

344.59 348.54 B: i don't know close to two hundred dollars and a meal it was it was a very good meal 

349.05 349.55 A: wow 

349.46 349.82 B: because i 

349.94 352.21 B: would not be able to afford that on my own 

353.76 354.12 B: um 

353.81 355.81 A: did you school did you school in new york 

356.08 358.81 B: no i went to um university of pennsylvania in philly 

356.74 357.26 A: as well 

359.52 360.02 A: got you 

360.40 361.14 B: where'd you go to school 

361.48 363.32 A: i went to mount saint mary's college 

363.23 363.64 B: oh yeah

368.10 368.96 A: yeah i 

369.17 370.28 A: i mean i've lived here all my life 

370.55 371.37 A: and uh 

372.52 374.18 A: so it's it's a nice state it's it's 

374.53 376.61 A: new york is a fun place to come visit my friend 

377.06 379.87 A: lives who lives up there go up and see him every once in a while but 

380.50 382.26 A: i could never live there he's 

382.39 385.58 A: transplanted and swarmed by it and and says he'll never move 

386.30 389.80 A: and uh so it's it's it's nice to go visit and 

390.70 393.88 A: to spend uh you know long weekend or to see a show but 

394.70 395.96 A: then i got to come home 

395.67 398.14 B: yeah i used to think i can never live here but then 

399.11 401.49 B: i don't know once i moved here it's 

400.86 402.27 A: yeah that's what most that happens 

401.87 402.69 B: it's not different 

402.90 404.21 B: it's not that bad once you move here 

404.56 408.92 B: i feel like when you visit you go to all the really crowded areas and do touristy things when you live here you don't 

404.86 405.26 A: well 

407.37 407.87 A: mhm 

409.15 410.06 B: see that as much 

410.25 411.02 A: right 

410.90 412.12 B: it's a great city i love it 

413.42 416.29 B: i grew up in new jersey so i used to come here a lot when i was a little kid 

416.74 417.70 A: what part of jersey 

417.96 419.26 B: um northern jersey 

419.76 420.41 B: burgen county 

421.08 423.19 A: just about everybody from mount saint mary's is from jersey 

423.23 423.91 B: oh really 

424.03 426.90 A: yeah i think jersey's staple crop is college students isn't it 

427.65 430.87 A: it's like what the state produces most of is college students 

430.78 431.78 B: that's funny 

431.26 434.83 A: no seriously everybody from just about everybody from the mount was 

434.97 435.87 A: from new jersey 

435.52 438.94 B: actually everybody at penn probably was from new jersey too 

438.06 439.41 A: oh see that's 

439.16 440.53 B: that's small state 

440.82 441.48 A: that's what jersey 

440.83 443.17 B: see it's a smart state we all go to college 

443.04 445.72 A: are there no colleges in aren't there like there's rutgers 

445.01 446.12 B: rutgers 

445.86 447.07 A: rutgers is in jersey isn't it 

446.87 449.30 B: yeah and the college of new jersey but that's about it 

450.00 450.42 A: that's it 

450.66 454.31 B: i think for the most part people in new jersey identify with either new york city or philadelphia 

454.46 454.90 A: yeah 

454.81 455.28 B: so 

456.60 457.73 B: people tend to go to 

458.10 461.12 B: other states (( )) because there isn't that much to do in new jersey itself 

461.11 461.51 A: uh-huh 

462.24 464.21 A: so do you know my friend steve louis
