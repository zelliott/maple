270.67 272.24 A: and up in canada 

272.33 275.87 A: quite frankly because everybody has health care something goes wrong 

276.42 277.43 A: they leap to the doctor 

278.09 280.97 A: and because of it it catches so much at the bud 

281.72 284.18 A: that you don't get the major effect 

292.90 293.23 A: yea 

292.96 294.79 B: i always get it a little early so

335.74 336.15 B: right 

336.09 340.85 A: do we have to shuffle the same stuff around over and over again i mean you know 

341.00 344.51 A: if worst gets to worse punch a little hole 

344.85 347.90 B: yea you kind of wish the windows would open 

347.67 349.44 A: exactly you know 

350.27 355.48 A: then of course you hear these wonderful stories about people being sucked out of planes from teeny tiny holes and what not 

355.66 358.06 B: right or you know alien resurrection 

358.51 359.30 A: exactly 

360.47 361.07 A: but hum 

361.82 365.02 A: health unfortunately most people again 

365.32 367.76 A: most people don't know a damn about health until 

367.91 368.99 A: the problems set in 

369.07 369.43 B: right 

369.95 372.70 A: and that's that's part of the trick we don't make 

373.51 374.56 A: we don't make health 

375.36 375.96 A: entertaining 

378.04 382.22 A: you know doctors are paid per view obviously there's the problem 

381.59 382.30 B: right 

382.60 383.05 B: hum 

383.22 386.36 B: that's an interesting concept i wonder what are the sort of things you can draw from that 

391.82 394.13 A: notice that no body has come up with the idea 

396.36 397.08 A: bubble gum 

399.13 404.16 A: right there i have given them an idea that will pay for this entire process 

404.37 404.93 A: i'm sorry 

405.17 405.86 B: oh quite all right 

406.36 409.19 A: ever noti- hey that's the other yea that's how you can tell 

409.96 411.06 A: geniuses who put 

411.63 412.89 A: key pads on 

413.02 417.94 A: pay phones i mean on the phone so while your talking your cheek brushes the numbers 

417.75 421.02 B: oh that dives me crazy particularly with cordless phones because huh 

421.12 426.68 A: cordless phones are designed for people who's heads are a third the size of human beings 

426.37 432.56 B: yes i completely agree with that or ones that have buttons that stick out as far as the ear piece does 

432.68 433.11 A: mm 

432.98 434.85 B: so you can't cradle the phone at all 

435.76 440.08 A: i mean i want one that quite literally has a little microphone and a little ear piece so i can put them in 

441.55 441.98 B: yes 

442.31 442.84 A: there's nothing 

449.99 456.95 B: huh ear pieces and just that little microphone on the side so every one walks around looks like they're talking to them selves 

456.98 457.82 A: well there's the trick 

458.07 460.76 A: right there you know if your going to be a schizophrenic 

461.17 462.42 A: find a cell phone 

462.78 466.71 A: find a dead cell phone and no one ever will know 

468.34 470.75 B: tips on how to be functional in society 

470.90 473.75 A: yea you know you just have to look functional 

473.55 473.89 B: right 

474.85 475.82 A: i mean hum 

476.17 478.28 A: in japan they actually have 

479.24 479.94 A: hair color 

480.47 482.88 A: that they sell to kids who's hair isn't 

483.06 483.93 A: as black 

484.31 485.95 A: as the other kids in their class 

485.82 486.39 B: really 

486.55 486.97 A: yup 

487.11 488.05 B: that i wasn't aware of 

487.25 488.37 A: that's conformity 

489.19 492.03 A: that's scary conformity 

491.89 496.93 B: yea well i mean they've gotten an interesting culture there which is also huh 

497.12 498.67 B: kind of peculiar in a couple of ways 

498.96 499.22 B: but 

498.96 499.37 A: oh yea 

499.74 501.17 A: you know hey 

501.50 511.24 A: you know we we eat mars bars and twinkies after they've been deep fried i don't think we have any right to say we're the supreme country on the face of the planet 

510.48 512.24 B: true enough 

513.03 514.56 B: huh i just remember huh 

514.90 515.92 B: reading on huh 

516.03 524.40 B: flash (( dot )) which is a new site online about a phone scam which had been going around japan in which apparently a bunch of people had been 

518.45 518.81 A: mm 

524.56 527.30 B: huh they they're referred to as one ring 

527.62 528.96 B: scams where 

529.06 533.76 B: hum somebody huh these companies would call peoples cell phones and then 

545.53 550.15 B: since there's such conformity you don't want to say hey i you know 

550.38 553.38 B: i was tricked into calling this company 

553.48 554.88 B: quite a few people just paid it 

555.16 556.84 B: and apparently hum this 

557.17 561.99 B: continues until they actually brought down a wireless phone net work in osaka 

562.09 563.80 A: well they did something like that in australia 

564.09 565.15 A: huh gut they would 

565.28 577.06 A: basically you would join a club you would refu- you know they would cancel the membership because of lousy service and they would send you back your refund but the check would say something like uh you know chronic masturbaters of australia 

578.36 582.91 A: something that was so degrading and vile that you wouldn't show it to people in public 

583.70 584.64 A: and because of that 

585.08 587.39 A: most of the checks never got cashed 

590.42 591.59 A: i have no shame 

591.71 598.24 A: then again i don't think anybody who does any kind of a serve or situation like this could honestly say 

598.81 599.75 A: that huh you know 

600.05 604.01 A: they're going to be as shy and awkward as the first person 

604.50 604.90 B: yea 

605.01 609.16 B: well it's interesting to see how people would behave in different context as well 

609.74 610.18 B: huh 

610.61 615.44 B: cause i've been i normally consider my self a fairly out going person who can usually talk 

615.63 616.73 B: huh even 

616.19 618.01 A: what kind of introvert would do this 

618.39 619.67 B: that's a very good point 

618.73 626.68 A: that's that's the scary thing when you think about it when you know what kind of people fill out surveys 

619.97 620.76 B: i was 

621.22 622.10 B: wondering about that 

627.33 631.22 A: when they tell me four out of five doctors came up with this conclusion which four 

631.69 632.78 A: who's the fifth 

633.17 641.38 A: what are the fifth like what it half of them don't take these test then we only have four out of five no actually we're looking at two out of eight 

642.80 652.69 B: and really that that that's the thing that's sort of interesting particularly polling in the u._s. now if you ever watch c._n._n. their on line poll says this or that 

651.80 654.54 A: plus or minus four percent sixty two percent of the time 

654.44 655.58 B: yes precisely 

655.10 655.74 A: so 

655.96 661.96 A: you sit there and say if your fifty two percent right with in pus or minus four percent how often are you right a hundred percent of the time 

662.88 663.28 A: none 

663.43 666.10 A: thank you then what your saying is bull shit numbers 

664.04 664.42 B: yes 

666.16 667.08 B: exactly 

667.60 672.02 B: well what the d._b. disclaimer is the thing that blows my mind not a scientific poll really 

671.41 681.13 A: mm (( )) my mother said to pick this poem 

682.37 683.70 A: i'm not surprised 

684.33 690.47 A: i'm not surprised that we you know we're the country who can't hey if we're the country where there's twenty five million illiterate people 

690.67 692.94 A: how accurate do you expect the numbers to be 

695.46 698.22 B: huh well i mean that that's huh 

698.36 701.29 B: this country has some interesting things about it and that 

701.94 705.47 B: the voter turn out seems to be just about as accurate as the huh 

705.77 710.30 B: online polls and things like that where you end with what like twenty five percent of 

710.49 710.99 B: the 

711.55 716.82 B: twenty five percent of the fifty percent of the u._s. populous who actually voted for one person or another 

717.04 717.52 A: oh yea
