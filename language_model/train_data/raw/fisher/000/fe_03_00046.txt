1.01 2.27 B: hi 

1.93 3.07 A: hello 

3.22 5.05 B: uh my name is brooke 

4.80 6.30 A: hi brooke i'm kristin 

6.25 7.29 B: hi 

7.90 10.17 A: so uh we're supposed to talk about illness huh 

9.73 11.70 B: [noise] apparently [laughter] 

11.15 14.50 A: [laughter] so uh do you struggle with the winters 

14.70 15.70 B: (( um )) 

15.97 19.36 B: i haven't in the past couple of years actually how about you 

19.32 25.77 A: um i always go through a period where i feel like a bear because uh from like 

26.15 31.16 A: a lot of it well basically from when the time zone you know changes when we have the fall back 

31.22 32.27 B: mhm 

32.08 37.03 A: i always uh go through a period of about a month where i have to i have a really hard time adjusting 

36.89 38.02 B: mhm 

37.38 46.56 A: and uh i find that i sleep a lot more than i otherwise normally do because i guess it's getting dark earlier it sends a signal to me that you know i should be sleeping 

46.52 48.17 B: right right 

47.01 48.98 A: so yeah it's really hard to deal with 

49.27 50.32 B: yeah 

50.50 62.65 B: i'm always uh [mn] i'm always very opposed to getting the flu shot for some reason because uh i never tend to get the flu [mn] and i always feel like it's something i should do but at the same time 

50.54 51.29 A: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

60.79 61.61 A: uh-huh 

62.71 64.75 B: why waste a couple of days of 

64.87 68.43 B: discomfort if i'm not going to get the flu anyway [laughter] 

68.22 69.32 A: right 

69.37 70.00 B: [mn] 

69.43 71.28 A: right yeah well uh 

71.34 73.48 A: it's a terrible thing too because uh 

73.53 88.15 A: well i don't know i don't like getting the flu shot either i just don't like shots uh and i'm just one of these people who are of the mindset that you know if you're going to get sick you might as well get it and ride it out kind of a more ma- natural thing than immunizations i suppose in a roundabout way 

76.51 77.49 B: mhm 

86.35 87.39 B: right 

88.19 97.68 A: but um my company where i work they give free fl- flu shots so if you don't go for a flu shot and then you get the flu and this has happened in real life my 

92.05 93.28 B: mhm 

96.93 99.43 B: you don't get time off or 

98.88 102.24 A: well no we do but my boss laid a guilt trip on me 

101.92 103.18 B: (( oh [laughter] )) 

102.32 112.29 A: well if you had a flu shot this might not have ever happened [laughter] it's just kinda like well gee i'm sorry but i think it's my choice how i choose to do my body but 

106.11 107.63 B: (( [mn] )) 

111.92 113.20 B: right 

112.46 118.12 A: [laughter] uh yeah so it's a strange thing so uh but i'm with you on that one 

116.46 117.54 B: yeah 

118.19 119.98 B: [laughter] 

119.29 120.03 A: (( [cough] )) 

120.29 124.89 A: no i also have kids so uh it's it's also one of those deals where uh 

120.38 121.09 B: uh 

125.92 133.92 A: they always bring something home so in my mind i'm getting the best immunization possible because [mn] i'm being exposed to everything under the sun 

127.79 128.94 B: yeah 

133.64 135.16 B: right right 

134.25 135.80 A: [laughter] 

135.92 148.84 B: yeah i used to get sick when i was much younger i would get sick even two or three times in a given winter but in actually just in the last couple of years i seem to have grown out of it which is nice [laughter] 

148.36 154.16 A: yeah definitely getting sick is no fun seems to always be harder on you when you're older too doesn't it 

148.97 149.74 B: and 

150.98 152.91 B: [laughter] 

154.24 157.48 B: yeah yeah [laughter] 

154.95 167.91 A: [laughter] i don't know i guess just you know we're older and our bodies aren't quite what they used to be so the aches and pains are you know on top of pre existing aches and pains and all that kind of stuff [laughter] 

161.24 162.54 B: [laughter] 

164.99 167.24 B: [laughter] 

169.07 170.01 A: uh-huh 

169.29 170.18 B: yeah 

170.87 178.04 A: yeah my daughter as a matter of fact just uh and this is really crazy she uh just got over chicken pox this past fall 

177.01 179.53 B: oh horrible 

178.51 182.95 A: so talk about uh childhood diseases it was one of those 

181.82 183.45 B: how old is she 

183.02 186.27 A: she's uh seven she'll actually be eight in about a week 

186.05 187.18 B: oh wow 

187.08 188.10 A: so uh it 

188.24 199.44 A: was one of those funny things where her pediatrician and i were talking about it and i'm like now how did this get passed us and he's like you know he says i think i do know and we kinda went through what had happened you know we had 

199.38 204.62 A: one of those when she goes in the kindergarten had the whole gammit of immunizations she had to do and 

204.37 205.41 B: mhm 

204.72 205.66 A: um 

205.65 219.87 A: it was one of those deals where he said oh you know you could get the uh the pox vaccinations but she's had so many we probably shouldn't do it now why don't we wait and you know come back in you know six months or whatever when she has to come in for another routine check and of course that never hap- i mean like 

212.57 213.92 B: right 

218.36 219.66 B: (( and [mn] )) 

219.88 225.41 A: i said my kids are constantly exposed to something so we're always in there for earaches you know something 

221.99 223.03 B: right 

224.72 225.73 B: mhm 

225.46 231.27 A: and uh so we never did have that routine check and then next thing we know she's got she's got chicken pox so 

231.52 237.77 B: chicken pox i definitely consider to be the worst illness i've ever had because i got it when i was thirteen 

237.35 238.49 A: oh no 

237.85 238.85 B: with those 

238.74 246.27 B: pretty i mean i had it at the same time as my brother who was fifteen at the time so he was even worse off than me but 

245.23 246.23 A: yeah 

246.05 257.44 B: i mean i was running like a hundred and three degrees fever for many many days and just yeah i was just i was completely covered it was a very very horrible experience [mn] 

250.81 251.72 A: ew 

256.61 258.14 A: oh yeah 

257.55 267.18 B: we both got it from my younger sister who was let's see if i was thirteen then she was uh seven at the time so you know it's a normal age for chicken pox but [laughter] 

266.58 267.56 A: (( dour )) 

267.70 272.89 A: oh yeah and th- then you get the whole thing you know don't itch or it gets a scar and all that [laughter] 

271.98 274.68 B: yeah and i definitely scarred [laughter] 

273.92 280.01 A: oh no well my daughter i i don't know i maybe this is normal but she even had 'em like in her scalp 

275.18 276.57 B: (( yeah )) 

280.10 282.46 B: oh yeah i had a lot 

282.15 283.05 A: did you 

282.47 290.73 B: in my scalp yeah they were cut like i would just run my hands through my hair and they're following weeks even and i would still be 

290.90 294.28 B: you know pulling them out it was really gross [laughter] 

292.38 293.30 A: oof 

293.52 298.31 A: oh yeah well yeah it's just k- it's an awful disease to have in in general you know 

298.21 299.61 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

299.42 305.83 A: what's even worse is the way people react when they they they hear you've had it they [laughter] they get that oh 

303.37 304.24 B: (( mm )) 

305.73 315.74 A: quarantine you [laughter] [laughter] yeah she's had uh chicken pox and she had um uh oh what's that called uh scarlet fever 

307.39 308.36 B: yeah 

315.43 316.71 B: oh wow 

316.31 327.58 A: yeah she had that when she was like six and that about sent my mom through the roof because i guess uh she had it before they came out with the um you know with antibiotics and that kind of thing 

326.64 330.95 B: right and now it's like nothing but it used to be a really big deal yeah 

328.11 329.40 A: oh yeah 

329.51 336.26 A: exactly yeah so when i told her that she's like oh my god and she's [mn] going on and on and of course you know 

336.94 343.86 A: even though i've got two little girls you know when your mother starts going off the handle about an illness you're just like maaaaa 

340.41 341.27 B: right 

343.37 344.35 B: yeah 

344.40 356.59 A: so i had to call my doctor right back after i hung up and i'm like is this true what my mom said and she's like no she's like you have to understand your mom got it when you know this is pre you know antibiotics and that kind of thing and that's all it's okay 

348.69 350.03 B: oh no 

353.92 355.40 B: yeah 

356.55 362.98 A: [laughter] yeah but we had to definitely quarantine then we i mean we really couldn't go round to anybody that time 

357.29 358.28 B: yeah 

362.69 364.31 B: right right 

363.78 364.74 A: yeah 

364.91 366.02 A: that's rough 

366.11 367.19 B: [laughter] 

366.52 367.88 A: [laughter] 

368.26 371.15 A: i'm just glad i'm in in good health in general 

368.54 369.36 B: (( [mn] )) 

370.96 373.38 B: yeah definitely [laughter] 

375.47 382.59 A: this has been a pr- pretty good uh knock on wood i guess because i don't wanna just jump prematurely but pretty good winter for us really 

382.71 389.29 A: we've not we've not had too many illness you know i mean we've hit the major ones for god sakes we had chicken pox and 

388.31 389.91 B: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

389.49 394.06 A: um i got bronchitis and my daughter got bronchitis but we both have asthma so 

392.34 393.32 B: (( oh )) 

393.99 395.63 B: oh that's horrible 

394.46 399.37 A: we had a we had the cold and i don't know maybe you know the strain um 

399.47 404.66 A: god it's some kind of um virus that usually hits in the fall 

404.77 408.34 A: i can't think of it the doctor told it to me and i've heard it before but anyway 

408.40 415.75 A: he said that there's just something about this one particular virus that you know people like us who have asthma are susceptible to uh having bronchitis 

415.23 417.53 B: huh yeah i'm not sure what that is 

417.51 418.84 A: yeah 

418.95 421.29 B: (( mm doesn't sound nice )) 

421.28 423.26 A: no it wasn't 'cause uh 

423.36 425.64 A: there's nothing worse than not being able to breathe you know 

425.83 432.83 A: even [laughter] even something as simple as not being able to pick uh or trying to take a shower was challenging so 

425.91 427.47 B: oh definitely 

427.81 428.76 B: [laughter] 

432.89 435.88 B: yeah oh that's horrible 

433.73 434.77 A: that was rough 

435.35 436.19 A: yeah 

436.28 437.56 B: it's really 

437.33 438.08 A: (( [mn] )) 

437.84 451.73 B: it's really just an an unacceptable thing for me in my life to get sick at this point i mean i guess i guess you can say the same for anyone's life but i just simply do not have any time for it and uh because i'm a student and i just i can't 

451.61 456.20 B: get sick and then not be able to study on a given night 

454.23 455.57 A: oh i know 

455.77 465.71 A: jeeze well i know and if you miss one class god forbid you don't have a a a good friend or a partner in there to share notes or something 'cause boy that messes you up 

462.78 463.81 B: yeah 

465.52 478.04 B: yeah i mean like only a few of my lectures are video taped and i can watch them on line if i have to miss them but it's more of just that i have you know hours and hours of reading to do every night and if 

478.36 486.83 B: and if you just have that sick feeling to you there's just no way that you can concentrate on reading and it's just it's such a step back so 

484.99 487.94 A: oh yeah oh i know that's true isn't it 

487.76 502.11 B: yeah i mean even if you can make it through your normal day routine and you know because i i tend to never miss class it's just kind of an [laughter] obsessive compulsive thing i have but um even if you can make it through your routine of going to classes and going to 

502.02 505.74 B: everything else you have to do you know at the end of the day 

505.82 509.46 B: [laughter] you still need to be able to think clearly and so that's 

509.91 512.45 B: that's just what i get very scared of 

512.10 521.22 A: yeah yeah and then it's rough 'cause if you are sick and you go into class then everybody harasses you oh why are you coming in you're going to give it to me [laughter] 

518.93 520.26 B: yeah exactly 

521.10 528.05 B: [mn] i'm always i'm always very upset when people come into classes sick and yet i do it myself but [laughter] 

526.18 527.28 A: i know 

527.65 529.33 A: it's a double whammy isn't it 

529.13 531.80 B: yeah definitely [laughter] 

529.81 531.09 A: [laughter] 

531.29 534.61 A: [laughter] oh boy i hear you though because uh 

534.79 546.73 A: whenever i get sick at work like there is uh when i got bronchitis before i even knew i had it i actually fell asleep at my desk and i take night classes also um so [laughter] it was one of those deals where you know 

541.45 542.27 B: oh 

546.75 547.47 A: i 

547.86 550.29 A: finally sent an email to my friend 'cause uh 

550.32 557.13 A: i my boss is a very difficult man and told her i'm like because it's in the middle of an audit i said i'm so sick i can't 

557.14 569.20 A: even keep my eyes open i'm going out to my car to take a nap and i had to like describe where i was going to sleep and you know where i was parked and all that and i told her i said if they come looking for me you have to come and get me [laughter] 

560.37 561.55 B: oh 

563.27 564.48 B: oh 

568.42 569.78 B: oh 

569.19 570.43 A: so i had to like 

570.38 579.26 A: make a little map for her where i was in the parking lot and then somehow miraculously i did wake up like two hours later but i was worthless i was worthless i couldn't do anything 

576.10 577.49 B: oh wow 

579.08 592.09 A: i then luckily i knew what the auditor was looking for so i kind of formulated the response that god forbid he would ask me anything else 'cause i had been like what [mn] when do i get my next dose of medicine i'm [laughter] what was the question 

579.11 580.16 B: oh 

589.91 591.46 B: (( [mn] )) 

591.95 593.82 B: [mn] [laughter] [mn] 

592.11 593.24 A: [laughter] 

597.71 599.34 A: i have friends who um 

599.56 602.51 A: where i work who have to travel from time to time 

602.57 603.57 B: mhm 

602.69 606.74 A: um there's only a few people in our company that have to travel a lot but 

606.68 618.32 A: i have more friends that go to our company's headquarters and wind up 'cause you know when you travel you go into different areas you get exposed to whatever is going around in that city at that time 

615.55 616.55 B: right 

617.02 621.21 B: right not to mention that flying on planes is just horrible 

619.77 624.88 A: yeah oh i know because of the air circulation's not you don't get the fresh air that you need but 

622.30 623.35 B: right 

624.23 625.33 B: right 

625.07 632.95 A: i have more friends say that they they take these planes and they they go to the corporate headquarters and then they get these hotels and they get deathly ill 

633.07 633.96 B: (( mm )) 

633.23 638.93 A: and uh one friend in particular she's like me she's asthmatic and and she's prone to illnesses anyway too 

639.00 640.00 A: and uh 

640.35 653.10 A: she's actually had like she's gotten sick on a wednesday and had to stay [mn] clear through till sunday 'cause she was too sick to leave the room and i'm like oh my god lynne that's gotta be horrible i can't think of anything worse than not being at home when you're sick you know 

645.88 646.63 B: (( ugh )) 

649.97 650.95 B: yeah 

652.88 655.37 B: (( yeah ugh )) 

654.19 655.08 A: so uh 

655.82 659.28 A: every time i think i got it bad i figure there's somebody out there that's probably got it worse than me 

658.88 660.86 B: oh definitely [laughter] 

659.78 661.78 A: (( [laughter] )) 

665.84 667.12 B: (( well )) 

668.14 669.28 A: so uh 

669.81 672.84 A: are we supposed to keep talking for like ten minutes 

669.86 670.86 B: [laughter] 

673.09 677.45 B: i guess so i was assuming that we'd get interrupted but [laughter] i don't 

676.20 679.43 A: i was thinking so too so you've not done this before either 

679.32 680.56 B: know no [laughter] 

680.25 685.82 A: oh [laughter] okay yeah i've not either i just i came across this by chance actually over the internet 

685.74 691.32 B: oh really my uh my linguistics professor emailed it to us yesterday i think so 

691.05 692.26 A: (( oh okay )) 

691.98 693.16 B: yeah 

692.83 693.77 A: okay 

694.52 697.92 A: well uh gosh i don't want to deviate from the plan um 

698.30 704.33 B: [laughter] let's see um do you do anything specific to prevent illness 

704.10 709.83 A: um you know i it's funny you should ask because just this year um actually 

710.00 719.46 A: i'm not sure if it's doing any good because before i got bronchitis i uh kept telling myself you know i'm going to take vitamins i'm really bad about taking pills god forbid i should like in my 

715.33 716.67 B: mhm 

717.26 718.39 B: mhm
