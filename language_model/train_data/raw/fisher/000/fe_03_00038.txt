13.10 14.48 A: okay 

14.14 14.69 B: um 

15.29 16.48 B: do you get sick a lot or 

17.33 20.76 A: uh usually at the end of the semester i'm a student 

20.79 21.60 B: oh okay 

21.73 22.82 A: so it's more like 

23.33 28.07 A: at the end of the semester when i'm done with everything then my body kind of shuts down for a little while 

28.45 29.23 B: yeah 

29.29 30.68 A: but how about you 

30.89 35.30 B: yeah um not necessarily when the seasons change but um 

36.51 38.68 B: philadelphia we get like a 

39.49 41.08 B: drastic weather changes 

41.31 42.04 A: oh really 

42.05 44.79 B: at times and that's usually like when it goes from 

45.74 48.67 B: hot to cold or cold to hot that's when i get sick 

48.81 49.53 A: mhm 

51.33 54.15 B: but last year i got really sick at the end of the semester 

54.76 55.45 B: and um 

57.68 60.02 B: during winter break and um 

60.63 63.40 B: this year i got a flu shot so i'm hoping to avoid that 

63.64 64.65 A: right right 

65.21 68.44 A: yeah last semester i got or last year actually i got 

68.53 69.88 A: really sick um 

70.32 70.96 A: at the end of 

71.29 72.65 A: the spring semester 

72.55 73.34 B: oh really huh 

73.07 75.77 A: so i spent the majority of may honestly 

76.37 78.35 A: being um feeling ill 

78.69 79.08 B: huh 

79.23 80.14 A: but i 

80.39 83.24 A: again i don't know that that has anything to do with the weather 

83.55 84.58 B: yeah um 

84.71 86.77 B: yeah i gu- i think of i guess like exams 

87.87 88.91 A: mhm right 

89.35 91.85 A: but i have heard or recently i heard that 

92.22 98.61 A: there used to be sort of a cycle when people would get sick mostly like in you know starting in the fall and then through the winter 

98.89 99.36 A: and that 

99.48 102.00 A: rarely do people get sick over the summer time 

102.39 106.09 A: but apparently in the past like five to ten years or something that's changed and 

105.78 106.99 B: yeah you know i 

107.48 108.50 B: that makes sense i 

108.74 114.60 B: seem to get remember like the before i got sick this winter i used to always ah it was the spring when i would go 

115.72 117.98 B: when i would go down with some kind of a flu 

119.59 121.69 B: um i don't know why that was but 

122.78 126.52 B: that's always worse for some reason it seems worse when you're sick and it's warm out 

126.88 128.72 A: right yeah it really does 

129.33 133.67 A: but maybe it's because in the winter you know you never really want to go outside anyways so 

133.16 133.79 B: yeah 

134.38 135.31 B: yeah um 

136.61 139.81 B: yeah what what do you do anything to keep yourself healthy or 

140.69 143.55 A: i usually get flu shots and this year i have not yet 

144.41 147.69 A: uh i don't know if i will or not honestly 

144.61 144.91 B: oh 

148.69 150.06 B: is there a reason for that or 

148.79 149.21 A: but 

150.49 151.57 B: don't want to get a shot or 

152.05 153.13 A: no it just 

153.44 156.29 A: right now i cause i just moved to milwaukee 

156.22 156.67 B: okay 

156.66 159.31 A: and i don't know where to go to get a flu shot 

159.52 159.89 B: mhm 

160.00 160.57 A: um 

161.35 164.02 A: i suppose i don't know if my family doctor would have 

164.41 165.35 A: that or not 

165.58 167.25 B: yeah they s- i don't know i have been in 

167.69 168.21 B: i'm a 

168.43 168.73 B: um 

168.94 169.65 B: actually i'm a 

169.76 170.01 B: um 

170.30 171.82 B: a professor at a university and 

174.45 174.98 B: i know that 

175.13 176.32 B: since i've been here 

177.96 179.01 B: ten years they 

179.94 183.15 B: i'd never heard of a flu shot before until i came here 

184.90 186.08 B: advertised for them 

186.27 187.63 B: pushed really hard for 

188.35 188.72 A: hm 

188.38 189.25 B: uh faculty and 

189.37 190.23 B: staff to get them 

190.60 191.06 A: yeah 

191.21 191.95 A: that's smart 

192.31 195.16 A: especially in in the hallways of academia like 

192.49 192.92 B: yeah 

194.69 196.26 B: oh my god yeah 

195.38 197.90 A: cl- you know colds and flus and everything it's 

198.05 199.02 A: (( )) like crazy 

198.99 200.54 B: oh especially i know that 

200.88 201.45 B: um 

202.24 206.86 B: you know well worse classes classrooms are bad but i was ah ah ah 

208.16 210.84 B: what we call here an assistant dean in a residence for 

211.74 213.04 B: a few years so 

213.17 216.28 B: i was responsible basically for ah a dormitory 

217.00 217.78 A: oh no 

217.19 217.55 B: and 

217.85 218.37 B: that 

218.63 220.75 B: that was the absolute worst 

221.09 221.97 A: yup i 

221.54 223.88 B: i w- i you know i think every couple weeks 

224.75 227.10 B: whenever anything would make its rounds you know you could 

227.41 229.54 B: follow it from floor to floor 

229.50 230.71 A: right right 

230.39 232.59 B: and eventually you know you just kind of gave in to it 

232.89 233.51 A: right 

234.71 235.73 B: but uh 

236.19 240.88 A: yeah actually i lived in a dorm i went to school in colorado the university of colorado 

240.58 241.60 B: oh wow okay 

241.28 245.63 A: um when i started my i didn't finish there but i started my undergraduate degree there 

245.42 245.82 B: okay 

246.21 249.20 A: and when i lived in the dorms i got sick and that was the 

249.38 252.56 A: the most miserable illness i've ever had because 

252.96 253.62 A: my my 

253.89 256.97 A: roommate was never home so she was just never around 

255.36 255.69 B: right 

257.38 259.32 A: and i was on the top bunk 

259.42 259.78 B: right 

264.53 265.07 B: oh 

268.42 270.88 A: die in my dorm room and nobody would notice 

271.34 272.47 B: yeah 

272.76 273.16 A: so 

273.47 273.89 A: so when 

274.01 276.97 A: i went crawling over to one of my room- or my um 

277.27 278.32 A: like hallmates 

278.41 278.76 B: right 

278.48 284.07 A: rooms in the middle of the night and i was knocking and i was like will you just make sure i'm alive in the morning 

283.98 286.80 B: yeah it's it's i'll you i don't know whether those 

286.91 292.24 B: illness whether those viruses like take on strength or not but it sure seemed that way to me 

292.38 292.90 A: yeah 

297.80 298.30 B: i guess 

299.38 301.80 B: that was that was worse that was the worst 

302.73 303.08 B: um 

303.28 305.09 B: from a from an illness point of view 

307.01 311.10 B: but i'm not a big i i'm not a big fan i don't know i mean i guess i don't know who is but 

311.71 312.74 B: kind of put off going 

313.88 314.91 A: yeah yup 

316.14 317.06 A: i do too 

321.10 321.62 A: yeah 

322.70 323.61 B: but i guess they say it's 

324.21 325.37 B: bad like people 

325.88 326.36 B: (( that are )) 

326.60 329.04 A: will take it too often or something mhm 

327.58 331.27 B: yeah and i probably would do that i have to admit so 

330.99 331.64 A: right 

334.01 336.25 B: right they probably do it for a reason 

338.35 340.19 A: yeah well right now um 

341.13 347.82 A: the health well i don't know about out there but around here the health care plans are all changing the insurances this year 

346.11 346.48 B: mhm 

347.75 348.34 B: oh okay 

348.44 349.97 A: for whatever reason so 

350.14 352.66 A: all my i'm a graduate student almost everyone that i know 

353.08 358.50 A: just got new insurance starting in august and now we all have to change doctors again in january 

358.43 359.00 B: ugh 

359.25 363.73 A: so that's another reason that we're like god do we want to go for the initial visit an- 

363.91 367.56 A: you know get things taken care of or just wait until january now an- 

368.14 371.74 B: yeah i r- you know i remember when i had to do that i switched from like the 

371.99 373.86 B: the university here had like uh 

375.11 377.45 B: the university's own plan and then 

377.58 378.25 B: when um 

379.29 380.36 B: i switched 

381.12 388.24 B: well when i got married i was (( gonna )) add my wife to it and the price jumped from i mean it was steep and uh i considered it steep it was about 

388.96 390.55 B: like fifty dollars a month 

390.86 391.46 A: mhm 

391.68 392.15 B: um 

393.99 395.96 B: as a single individual 

396.19 396.71 A: right 

396.55 397.63 B: which which is a lot 

397.90 398.44 A: mhm 

398.34 398.89 B: um 

399.62 404.01 B: but when i wanted to add someone it would've gone up to like a hundred and forty dollars a month 

404.22 404.94 A: right 

405.03 405.55 B: and i 

406.25 407.26 B: you know i just could not 

407.80 409.31 B: i mean i thought that was i mean 

409.45 418.23 B: they were i i didn't like the way they treated like a married couple the same way as if like i had five kids you know that like constantly going you know 

415.26 416.83 A: right 

418.34 418.75 B: you know 

426.76 427.81 B: this other plan you had like

436.19 436.73 A: yeah 

439.79 440.43 A: right

460.85 461.87 B: yeah um 

462.55 463.83 B: well she had what i 

464.27 464.73 B: you know

467.73 468.59 B: health care 

468.91 473.63 B: pers- i mean from a working perspective she had what i thought would have been my dream job because 

474.43 476.30 B: she only worked weekends at night 

476.64 477.22 A: mhm 

477.02 480.97 B: and that was considered a full time job so she worked twenty four hours a week 

481.14 481.60 A: right 

483.80 484.72 B: um you know and had 

484.96 488.70 B: two weeks of vacation which you know if you took them consecutively would be a month which is not 

488.81 489.20 B: bad 

489.38 490.37 A: right right 

490.11 492.08 B: for for this country at least and uh 

491.63 492.18 A: yeah 

493.54 494.24 B: she could not take 

495.34 496.75 B: i uh she worked in oncology 

497.60 498.36 A: oh okay 

503.52 503.92 B: the majority of the 

504.48 505.16 B: time so 

505.11 505.71 A: yeah 

507.78 509.15 A: so i'm sure 

509.87 510.59 A: yeah and 

510.21 511.38 B: which is kind of hard for 

515.85 516.83 A: right right 

519.69 520.03 B: so 

520.34 522.58 B: where where what what are you studying in graduate school 

522.87 523.49 A: english 

524.09 526.47 A: yeah i'm actually in a program called modern studies 

526.62 526.91 B: oh 

527.05 529.76 A: which is more cross-disciplinary 

530.75 533.63 A: like english english literature in theory but we also do some 

533.87 537.33 A: like some studies stuff and history and performance study an- 

537.19 537.51 B: okay 

537.72 541.20 A: it's kind of ah within the english department you build your own 

541.31 541.72 A: sort of 

542.07 543.14 B: oh that's kind of nice 

543.11 549.74 A: yeah it's really interesting and that way i can still take literature courses and theory courses and i can take some study classes 

549.88 550.43 A: too or 

550.85 554.53 A: um a lot of people take courses in the communication department and 

554.92 557.42 B: that's good film film is pretty hot right now 

557.59 558.15 A: mhm 

558.26 559.16 B: at least i know 

561.97 562.28 B: (( )) 

567.01 569.45 B: and it seemed to be you know like you you said
