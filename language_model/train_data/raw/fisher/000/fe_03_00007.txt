181.61 187.96 B: yeah i felt that way too you know but you'd be surprised like they charge you so much for room and board in college it's ridiculous you know but 

187.34 188.46 A: (( mhm )) 

188.42 196.74 B: and um if you just lived and ate on your own you could save a lot of money but that's how the college makes money off of you you know it's one of the ways that the college makes money off of 

197.19 198.24 B: (( you there's al ))

304.05 305.43 A: [laughter] 

305.68 314.52 A: [laughter] that's what i like at the dining halls you can almost al- you can always get pasta every day but you can't eat pasta every day like you can't live on italian food 

311.84 313.18 B: (( mhm no )) 

314.47 326.76 B: no no no no it's not it's not really good for you either because there's no protein in pasta and stuff although have you seen they have this new kind of pasta that's like infused with all this protein and stuff i don't i've never tried it but 

318.51 319.76 A: (( yeah )) 

326.10 329.59 A: oh really [noise] 

326.99 328.21 B: yeah 

328.24 340.33 B: it sounds sounds like an interesting option because when i first started cooking for myself after college like that was all i knew how to make you know and i bare- i barely knew how to do that like i didn't know you needed a colander to drain the water and stuff like that that's how like inept i was 

334.68 335.68 A: mhm 

338.51 339.55 A: [mn]

351.04 354.24 A: [mn] so you cre ate and not cook [mn] 

353.92 359.84 B: yeah usually see [mn] to cook stuff out of a cookbook is it takes so much more time you know 

354.69 355.76 A: [laughter] 

359.49 360.48 A: mhm 

359.85 363.97 B: than if you just like kind of open up a bunch of stuff and throw it in and spice it up 

363.18 365.31 A: and hope it tastes okay or 

364.39 368.74 B: exactly yeah like i make stew right and um 

367.82 368.63 A: uh-huh 

368.85 381.09 B: and i just feel like you throw the meat and the beans and all the sauce in there and and then i mean you can work off a recipe but you can also just open your spice cabinet and like toss in oregano and all this stuff [noise] i don't know 

380.49 388.63 A: [noise] i'm not that brave i usually just follow a recipe [mn] and make what i have my mom i ask my mom what i should [mn] put in

411.60 419.18 A: um i like to m- i make chili sometimes i really like that or um chicken enchilada casserole 

414.80 415.86 B: chili 

419.25 421.75 B: (( chicken chicken what enchilada did you say excellent )) 

421.16 426.08 A: chicken enchilada casserole it's this like you like layer the shells and then it has um

449.44 454.18 A: yeah all i have is a microwave i don't have much to work with right now [laughter] 

453.30 457.79 B: (( [laughter] that kind of limits you a little bit like to uncle ben's quick meals and stuff you know )) 

457.28 460.51 A: yeah like roman noodles all the time 

459.91 462.10 B: oh roman yes yes

469.98 471.93 A: i try not to [laughter] 

471.29 474.26 B: [laughter] it's like nine hundred percent of your daily sodium 

474.06 475.63 A: [mn] 

474.89 484.45 B: (( [laughter] it's like uh like soy sauce is really bad for you you know full of salt and but i don't really care you know i just kinda like to eat what i eat you ))

498.94 505.86 A: well then they change their mind and say it's like first they're like eggs are bad for you and then they're like eggs are good for you and 

504.29 513.47 B: sort of exactly the whole medical paradigm like the last thirty years has been overturned in the last year they're like oh no you don't really want to eat twelve things of bread and pasta a day 

509.49 510.77 A: mhm

515.00 516.41 A: yeah that's t- 

517.28 522.60 B: and then you've got this whole other set of doctors that's like no protein is bad it'll kill you it'll cause you heart attacks and [mn]

598.10 600.26 A: [laughter] yeah i can imagine 

600.53 601.76 A: some people are 

601.95 603.76 A: take that too literally

609.87 610.91 A: yeah 

618.71 620.41 A: [laughter] 

619.21 620.35 B: [laughter] 

620.78 622.72 A: that's one way to get your money's worth 

622.22 626.93 B: (( yeah yeah but you know what i miss really it's one of the main things i miss most about college is uh )) 

627.03 632.88 B: it's like being able to eat like with a big group of people like at a an assigned time every day you know 

632.88 634.38 A: (( mhm )) 

633.12 635.58 B: it like really builds community i think [sigh] 

635.95 636.93 B: (( um )) 

637.19 639.75 B: you kind of miss that once you get out but yeah 

639.73 640.69 A: [laughter]

667.39 670.05 A: trying to think of a movie that involves food 

670.96 674.21 A: i just saw my big fat greek wedding that had food in it 

672.69 675.67 B: my big fat greek wedding indeed yeah yeah it 

674.33 677.45 A: [laughter] they're always eating 

677.03 678.06 B: (( was hilarious )) 

678.16 679.69 B: it was hilarious 

681.03 682.03 B: uh 

681.32 685.96 A: well they chose to eat at home and not eat well i guess they do eat out at the restaurant sometimes 

685.17 687.19 B: yeah they have a diner but i guess that's 

687.38 689.16 B: (( it was a lifestyle sort of )) 

687.56 690.55 A: that's still like they're cooking it so it's not really 

689.49 693.35 B: yeah exactly it's like a dual thing it's like the college dining hall right 

693.41 694.73 A: yeah 

694.72 695.61 B: (( um )) 

694.88 699.61 A: but they have to clean up too so that's more eating at home than eating out 

699.26 701.90 B: but you could hire somebody to clean up right 

701.30 702.53 A: oh that's true 

702.08 707.34 B: you kn- you know the help cleans up and and you sort of eat the leftovers or whatever you've cooked or 

707.61 710.23 B: or you can make your own stuff and 

709.74 710.67 A: (( mhm )) 

710.36 714.20 B: i don't know kind of a mixed bag have you ever seen big night
