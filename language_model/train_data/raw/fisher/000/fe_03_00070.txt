37.91 39.58 A: [laughter] 

40.50 43.56 A: (( yeah well i don't know i mean some of it's )) 

43.74 51.80 A: some of it's okay i mean it depends on what they put under reality shows i mean i certainly don't know if i'd watch survivor 

51.97 53.75 B: mm yeah [laughter] 

52.96 58.11 A: but there are some game shows that sort of that are more reality 

58.64 62.36 A: like than others that i've that i've seen and i like 

63.55 65.70 B: do you know like any specific ones 

65.34 68.06 A: um have you ever seen junkyard wars 

67.46 68.79 B: no i haven't 

68.25 71.08 A: oh it's so it's a really funny british show 

70.70 72.89 B: what's it what happens in it 

72.30 74.05 A: well they have a um 

74.08 85.51 A: they have a junkyard and they gather up two teams one of 'em is usually a team that specializes in some engineering or mechanics or something like that and the other one is 

85.44 90.72 A: sort of randomly put together often 'cause like they're all wrestlers or something [laughter] 

90.77 98.93 A: and they're asked to sort of create a machine out of parts that they find in the junk yard in about ten hours 

98.89 99.49 B: (( mhm )) 

99.29 101.92 A: and they then have to the next day they 

102.04 107.48 A: have competitions as to which machine works best under the task 

105.54 107.13 B: (( mhm [laughter] mm )) 

107.17 111.94 B: and they don't have any like do they have a specific requirement of what sort of machine it's supposed to be or 

111.72 119.01 A: well usually they define the task like okay you have to build um um something that 

119.96 129.85 A: some vehicle that travels up to a train track sits on it and then travels along it for a specific distance and you'll be judged on speed and distance and 

125.74 126.53 B: oh 

129.12 134.30 B: wow this is much more creative than survivor like ingenuity kind of exercise 

134.65 140.32 A: yeah it's really it's really fun to watch because it's sort of interesting to see how they come up with solutions 

140.35 144.67 A: too they really describe they spend a l- more than half the show describing 

144.80 146.05 A: how they 

146.35 150.86 A: come up with the plan of what they wanna make and actually actualize it 

150.88 152.47 A: so it's it's interesting 

152.21 153.87 B: (( mm mm yeah i saturday )) 

153.53 157.37 A: i think there's one for kids on like saturday mornings 

158.06 162.01 A: um that's american but i i have never seen that one 

162.94 164.06 B: morning 

164.40 169.32 B: i don't i've never seen it either i don't know i've seen i mean i've seen 

169.36 171.52 B: an episode of survivor 

171.64 172.57 B: (( twice )) 

172.97 174.81 A: the same episode twice 

174.03 178.23 B: no not the same one [laughter] no like two different survivor 

175.19 176.44 A: [laughter] 

178.47 188.21 B: groups like they do like survivor africa survivor australia or whatever and i've seen two different ones but that's only one episode of each and 

180.31 181.20 A: oh 

184.57 185.40 A: huh 

187.61 189.13 A: only one episode of each 

188.50 190.34 B: they were both the last episode 

190.69 195.23 A: oh yeah there there's a lot of hype surrounding the last episodes 

191.30 191.86 B: (( [mn] )) 

194.83 195.84 B: yeah 

195.72 196.62 A: yeah 

196.03 209.75 B: um my family gets really into it [laughter] like they'll like of course they're going to root for like whoever they like but they just like they'll scream at the at the people who are like against their favorite person and they're 

210.29 213.48 B: crazy [laughter] it's it's like a sport 

211.46 219.16 A: [laughter] well i mean honestly it's not like it's not that much different than say watching a sports event 

218.57 220.20 B: mhm that's true 

219.51 224.28 A: so so it's not like i mean if you enjoy it then i think it's fine 

223.76 224.99 B: yeah 

224.36 228.62 A: yeah i i i think it's interesting though like when when 

226.86 227.42 B: (( [mn] )) 

228.65 229.84 A: when we were in 

229.97 235.93 A: we were in germany two years ago living in germany and they came up with big brother 

236.27 240.63 A: it must have been well they didn't come up with it i mean it was it's like dutch i think 

240.67 241.85 A: and um 

241.40 242.72 B: (( mhm )) 

242.07 247.97 A: but they started the season and there was a lot of press in germany about whether or not it was ethical 

248.61 250.91 A: to put these people on television 

249.13 250.32 B: (( yeah oh )) 

251.32 253.44 A: in this somewhat caged setting 

254.32 255.87 B: aren't they volunteering though 

255.69 260.62 A: yep they volunteer and they win lots of money for it but germans are very 

260.87 264.45 A: careful about treatment of others 

263.86 265.25 B: well that makes sense 

264.98 268.87 A: yeah [laughter] and they're they're also really really 

269.28 274.46 A: uh easily pulled into random intellectual discussions 

274.17 275.21 B: (( too [laughter] )) 

274.56 283.51 A: [laughter] so um they had lots and lots of discussions on it and but the actual show turned out to be a huge hit just absolutely gigantic 

282.87 284.16 B: oh yeah 

283.90 287.40 A: and then they did survivor a little bit after that 

287.48 289.31 A: and it totally flopped 

287.56 289.66 B: the german version survivor 

289.35 289.91 A: (( mm )) 

289.71 291.39 B: german version survivor 

290.79 296.00 A: yeah the pretty much the same thing they called it something like go to an island or 

295.11 300.91 B: so it did the opposite of here because big brother was not very big here and survivor was huge 

296.89 297.79 A: yeah 

298.72 299.70 A: right 

300.72 307.07 A: yeah and i wonder why that is like i mean to some extent it probably has to do with the fact of which came out first 

301.20 302.43 B: (( wow mm )) 

307.33 315.87 B: that that's true um i don't know what are what are the elements of of big brother they're just kind of like a bunch of people in a house with cameras 

315.33 316.45 A: yeah 

317.01 321.86 A: yeah which is sort of like except they can't i mean it's like um 

321.98 323.82 B: i was going to say it's like real world but 

323.12 326.19 A: yeah it's like real wor- world but they can't get out 

326.13 326.97 B: okay 

326.74 333.14 A: and they have to do various tasks in order to m- make enough money to 

333.30 336.47 A: supply their house with food and stuff like that 

336.59 338.09 B: (( yeah mm okay huh )) 

338.43 341.84 A: so sometimes they have to raise chickens or 

338.46 339.01 B: (( i )) 

341.11 346.27 B: wonder if there is a cultural thing about that that's makes it so different between the two 

346.30 348.76 B: i don't i i don't see it if there is 

348.44 354.08 A: [mn] i'm thinking that it might have something to do with what is allowed to be shown how much 

354.25 355.04 B: oh 

355.16 356.13 A: maybe 

355.77 356.33 B: (( [mn] )) 

356.26 359.70 A: in in america somehow the context of survivor 

359.99 370.69 A: being out somewhere it it'll it'll that's not in a normal domestic situation that allows um them to take a little bit more liberty with what they're allowed to show 

369.74 371.46 B: (( mm mhm )) 

371.31 375.40 A: and and in germany you can just show anything all the time so 

373.62 375.17 B: (( right right )) 

375.82 389.11 A: you know sh- and they they'll even advertise later they started like doing like girls' house so they just had a bunch of girls and really the main premise was like get old men to watch women in the shower together 

389.81 392.67 A: 'cause they could right [mn] 

392.94 398.38 A: it wasn't it was in america i think they may not show the showers often or if they do then 

398.72 402.14 A: the contestants all wear all their clothes all the time [laughter] 

403.03 404.02 A: yeah 

404.42 410.26 A: but so i think that that might be i think that's sort of the thing that pulls people into survivor it's 'cause 

404.48 405.05 B: (( [laughter] )) 

410.31 412.21 A: it sort of puts 

413.55 416.21 B: wow [mn] mhm well it distances you from it yeah 

415.62 420.34 A: yeah it allows you and it allows you to see people doing things that 

420.87 423.39 A: have some sort of semblance of 

424.70 426.65 A: i don't know true interaction 

425.54 435.58 B: mm yeah [mn] yeah they're well also they're not ki- they're not in a societal setting so they're not necessarily governed by the principles of society like they're kind of in their own they have to formulate their own 

436.40 438.52 B: like way of living so 

437.92 439.73 A: yeah huh 

440.18 444.09 A: wow now i think i like it more than i used to [laughter] yeah 

442.12 445.66 B: [laughter] intellectualize it and then it's more interesting [laughter] 

444.72 456.20 A: [laughter] i don't know i still i i guess i don't have m- the my main reason for not watching it is i usually either don't watch television on the nights stuff like that is on 

456.25 458.38 A: or there's something else that i'm already watching 

457.96 460.73 B: i watch friends and will and grace that night so 

460.27 465.71 A: yeah exactly that's yeah i'm i'm a big fan of those too although fr- 

465.73 472.55 A: will and grace has had too many very special will and grace episodes this this season but i still like it 

469.11 470.54 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

471.29 472.11 B: yeah 

473.18 473.97 A: yeah 

474.08 475.46 B: (( um oh )) 

475.90 479.54 B: (( i forgot what i was i just thought of something else like that really appeals )) 

480.35 483.81 B: um one of the questions wasn't it that what was the appeal of 

487.88 491.09 B: (( oh i had the thing oh i lost it )) 

490.10 492.02 A: yeah i never remember what the 

492.30 496.11 A: robot voice asks asks [laughter] 

493.57 500.25 B: [laughter] you ha- have to wonder about the guy that just sits there and reads off those things do 

500.06 506.53 A: i think it's a computer i think the computer yeah i think it is i i don't know though i mean i've only 

501.71 502.59 B: you think so 

506.14 508.68 B: like maybe like the guy records it 

508.64 514.67 A: yeah that's probably what it is in the in the in the 'cause there's like a shift in the voice tone 

514.38 515.73 B: mhm 

515.14 521.60 A: and so i think that they it it reads a certain script and then it adds in certain elements 

521.22 528.06 B: right like like when you say like you have called eight nine five or whatever like that 

521.98 523.32 A: when necessary 

527.20 531.06 A: right [laughter] yeah how did you learn about this 

530.99 536.22 B: um i'm taking a linguistics course actually right now um harvard yeah 

533.87 535.00 A: oh where 

535.63 536.75 A: oh wow oh 

537.09 542.97 A: okay that's sort of how i learned it my boy about it my boyfriend is a linguistics graduate student 

542.94 543.66 B: oh 

543.41 545.37 A: at ohio state university 

544.46 546.58 B: oh okay are you in ohio 

546.58 547.65 A: yes 

547.05 548.25 B: oh [mn] 

548.31 549.31 A: yeah 

548.53 549.92 B: (( that's fun [mn] )) 

549.88 554.52 A: yeah it's okay right now i i i guess living would be like 

555.25 560.32 A: quite a stretch of the imagine since i really only sit in front of my computer and write 

560.05 561.63 B: [laughter] are you a writer 

560.41 561.38 A: [laughter]

563.65 564.71 B: (( oh okay ))

567.45 568.97 B: [laughter] 

575.89 578.98 B: [laughter] oh i can understand that
