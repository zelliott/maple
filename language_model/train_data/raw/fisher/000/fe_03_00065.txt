56.88 68.52 B: yeah i go to um a real small private college here and i also work there full time so i know everybody and i work in an office where a lot of the problem students come in and cause a problem 

59.47 60.38 A: uh-huh 

68.07 69.36 A: mhm 

68.79 79.51 B: and it's really hard for me to disassociate that between that and talking to the students and saying oh by the way so and so came in screaming at me the other day [laughter] i really have to kinda watch that yeah 

78.32 81.96 A: i would be terrible at that job [laughter] 

80.44 86.97 B: (( [laughter] it's like if ever you seen 'em in the hallway and you just wanna be like why were you yelling at me the other day [laughter] or in a class with you )) 

86.28 88.52 A: [laughter] 

87.34 91.97 B: [laughter] oh now do you do any of the other things like the smoking or 

91.20 92.67 A: i smoke 

92.07 93.44 B: you do okay 

92.73 96.20 A: and it's terrible i think that's for me that was the worst one 

93.93 94.67 B: (( [mn] )) 

95.92 97.09 B: the worst one 

96.54 99.57 A: because yeah and i don't even smoke that much i smoke like 

101.34 103.26 A: less than a pack a week 

102.90 105.56 B: okay oh so that's like hardly anything really 

104.53 109.20 A: hardly any but i've been smoking since i was fourteen and i ca- i still can't quit 

108.78 109.99 B: oh okay 

109.24 110.25 A: so it's like 

110.46 113.49 A: i'm more of a social smoker but it's enough to it 

114.15 117.21 A: i know it's harder to quit than i thought it would be 

116.68 117.67 B: okay 

117.24 120.04 A: and so that's that's the worst one for me 

119.54 125.05 B: okay yes see i don't smoke but my boy- my live in boyfriend does smoke 

124.59 125.75 A: mhm 

125.09 134.04 B: and um actually my father also is a very heavy chain smoker yes and my father just had a heart attack this uh in last march 

129.07 129.95 A: (( is he )) 

133.99 142.43 B: my boyfriend it scared him so much that he quit smoking and he lasted until about a m- about three weeks ago he started smoking again 

136.45 137.84 A: oh that's great 

142.05 142.93 A: (( oh )) 

142.81 155.09 B: and we just moved into a new house while he had quit smoking and now the house smells again and all that but i see how bad it is because i thought he was doing fine and having no cravings and he just all of a sudden started up again after nine months 

153.94 164.80 A: it's so easy yeah i quit for sixteen months once and then i and then i moved and i went to grad school and i met all these people that smoked and it was just so easy to just go right back into it 

156.93 158.09 B: wow 

159.77 160.72 B: yeah 

163.03 163.91 B: yeah 

164.83 165.67 B: yeah 

165.09 169.50 A: um yeah i think it was easy i quit after i graduated college 

169.11 170.35 B: okay okay 

169.51 170.33 A: (( and i )) 

170.76 180.00 A: i lived at home again for a while and nobody smokes at home and and nobody smoked where i worked so it was easy like i associate with people but it's so easy 

178.41 179.38 B: yeah 

179.80 183.41 B: yeah i mean he lasted a long time he had all of his friends smoke 

181.93 182.65 A: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

183.30 192.33 B: and he even went on a trip to a hunting trip to canada with some friends and he drove a a twenty hour trip without smoking with two smokers in the car 

191.63 192.71 A: wow 

192.22 201.34 B: and i'm like you did all that and you came back so i i believe smoking is one probably one of the biggest evils [laughter] but you know you just can't get away from it but 

198.34 199.33 A: i agree 

201.18 215.64 B: i mean even with the alcohol too though i'm thinking is you know if you're just a social drinker and you don't drink that much it's fine but when it gets to the point where you become violent or it affects your family or your work then yeah that's kind of just up there with smoking for me [laughter] 

205.80 206.74 A: mhm 

215.94 223.36 A: i think so too personally i don't know any anybody that i don't think i know anybody that has any serious alcohol problems 

216.61 217.62 B: (( oh yeah )) 

223.20 225.82 B: okay see i had a couple in my family 

225.53 226.44 A: uh-huh 

225.85 230.72 B: and i have a prior boyfriend who was um a very violent alcoholic 

230.84 232.49 A: that's horrible 

231.35 239.17 B: and so i had to i lived with that and i eventually did get out of it but i still i still wonder about him because i know he has two kids with a prior girlfriend 

238.70 239.62 A: uh-huh 

239.07 241.21 B: and um when these kids 

241.08 248.77 B: he's from down south and when the kids come up to visit him he's off at the bar and they have no food in the house to eat and they have they don't go anywhere and 

247.87 248.43 A: (( [mn] )) 

248.57 256.17 B: you know i feel so bad for the people in his family and the people around him and he's ruining himself and everybody that loves him 

249.34 250.39 A: (( that's rough )) 

256.67 258.26 B: (( so yeah )) 

256.98 266.67 A: i have a friend who who who's father was an alcoholic and he he won't even let himself have a glass of wine or anything because he's terrified of becoming like that 

265.97 267.59 B: yeah yeah 

267.03 268.56 A: i can't imagine that 

268.33 278.65 B: yeah see i have i have an aunt and uncle um that were my aunt was the kind who would hide the vodka bottles and you know those collector cans of beers like for harley davidson and all that 

274.72 275.83 A: mhm 

278.07 279.24 A: mhm 

278.55 286.03 B: her son well my cousin had those and she even i mean even af- after they were like ten years old she was drinking those when she got desperate 

286.27 301.23 B: and she lost her licence through drunk driving so she'd be walking up to the liquor store and she was i mean she was my grandma's age so she was in her late seventies when she was doing this and the alcoholism eventually killed her because her she got diabetes but they couldn't treat it 'cause her liver and kidneys were so bad and 

300.15 302.03 A: wow oh no 

301.28 303.94 B: that eventually killed her and she really and 

304.31 311.46 B: her hus- her second husband is the one who kinda forced her to drink 'cause she'd never drank until she met her second husband [mn] 

312.03 313.48 A: do you think um 

314.05 316.39 A: do you think some people are more 

316.44 323.76 A: predisposed to do you think it i mean i guess i'm asking do you think it's a genetic thing do you think it's a family thing or just an environmental thing or 

323.86 326.40 A: 'cause it 'cause it seems like some people i know are just 

327.13 331.06 A: affected by it more easily and are more 

328.34 329.34 B: yeah 

331.19 334.90 B: see i think that part of it is um 

335.00 346.87 B: i think a very small part of it is genetic i i my guess is that it's more environmental but i think too as like w- what i told my boyfriend is i think he has a very um addictive personality 

339.63 340.70 A: mhm 

346.29 348.29 A: (( yeah i guess that was what i was getting at )) 

347.41 350.51 B: where i'm very much of a control freak 

350.06 351.14 A: mhm 

350.53 360.64 B: so it to me as an and i i mean in high school i tried smoking and all that but to me it was this isn't you know i couldn't imagine something like that controlling my life because i'm such a control freak 

354.27 355.12 A: mhm 

359.85 361.86 A: it's not even fun [mn] 

361.16 371.10 B: yeah [laughter] yeah but i think people who are like more laid back and you know kinda like just let things go and you know they kinda allow themselves to almost be more 

362.15 363.36 A: [laughter] 

364.63 365.64 A: uh-huh 

371.21 374.14 B: controlled or be more addictive 

372.10 373.34 A: (( that )) 

373.59 374.88 A: yeah maybe 

374.43 386.91 B: i don't know 'cause it's i always tell him i always say you're weak i don't need that kinda thing you're just weak because you can't walk away from it and i mean i'm like joking with him but i mean i keep telling him i think he he must have more of an addictive personality than me 

387.06 393.79 B: if i could have one and then say well whatever 'cause even when he started back up again it made him sick sicker than a dog for two weeks 

393.94 400.63 B: his stomach hurt he had yeah his stomach hurt he had diarrhea real bad he was like you could even tell he was coughing more and 

394.54 396.06 A: i can believe that 

399.51 402.10 A: oh my gosh i didn't realize it would be that bad 

401.49 409.66 B: yeah it was his sinuses were bugging him and you know he had more phlegm and he he noticed all these kinds of things yet he lived through that to keep smoking 

409.33 416.53 A: did did he pick up where he left off or did he just gradually start smoking again was it a couple every now and then or did he just start 

416.56 421.16 B: he just i mean he's back to he's back to smoking as much as he did 

417.42 418.22 A: (( straight in )) 

420.72 421.92 A: mhm 

421.26 430.42 B: from what i understand it was funny because he was on a hunting trip and he came home and he had a pack of cigarettes in his pocket [laughter] so he had started for probably like three or four days before he even came home 

430.18 444.45 B: before i even knew about it but and originally he was saying okay i'm only going to smoke outside but then it got really cold up here [laughter] so then eventually it just seeped back into the house and he started smoking like normal right away and like i said he put up with being sick for a good two weeks 

435.91 437.10 A: mhm 

444.49 445.44 A: wow 

444.87 452.27 B: in order to be able to smoke and i thought my god how much of a control does that substance have over you [laughter] in order to put up with that 

452.44 458.00 B: 'cause to me i would be i would be like well i'd rather be not smoking which is healthier anyway 

458.34 470.14 A: it's interesting that you said he went hunting when he was doing it because i have some friends who live in michigan who always go camping and that's always the time nobody can quit smoking when there's a camping trip involved you have to put it off until after camping because 

467.17 468.52 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

470.32 471.75 A: (( i don't i don't know )) 

471.35 477.71 B: [laughter] yeah [laughter] but always tell him it's like you're always going to go every year so you gotta survive it at least one year 

474.99 475.98 A: yeah 

478.02 492.76 B: so although now with the last two the overeating and the exercising that's my problem where i may call him addictive but i i mean and i'm not obese i'm not heavily overweight i'd like to lose like maybe twenty thirty pounds which i put on in school [laughter] 

487.00 487.93 A: mhm 

492.00 494.62 A: i gained a lot of weight when i went to school too 

493.29 494.27 B: yeah 

494.44 501.79 B: yeah but it's and i and i'm kinda like i try to do like the heath food and all that kind of stuff and but 

498.88 499.93 A: mhm 

501.74 514.46 B: i no- i notice if i'm like stressed out or bored is i automatically when i was young i was very very overweight as a child i probably weighed more in grade school than i do now [laughter] [laughter] but i mean i i still so i struggle with my weight a lot 

506.98 507.94 A: mhm 

510.15 510.99 A: wow 

513.73 514.72 A: mhm 

514.28 517.80 B: but i see that as being more of a problem for me 

517.84 524.30 B: and more of a habit for me and i am very lazy and i do not like to exercise [laughter] 

523.41 533.76 A: [mn] now see i'm the opposite i don't mi- i haven't been exercising because it's been finals week and i had three papers to do [laughter] but i would rather exercise than 

526.85 527.79 B: mhm 

529.84 531.24 B: (( [laughter] )) 

533.85 541.23 A: i love eating i love eating [laughter] so i don't want to like think about what i eat and i it's disgusting what i eat sometimes 

534.96 537.14 B: yeah yes [laughter] 

540.58 542.30 B: [laughter] 

541.44 552.66 A: but oh i my i have friends at home too and they can go on diets and they can be so careful about what they eat and i ca- i don't have that kind of willpower i have the willpower to exercise but not to 

553.31 555.68 A: eat h- healthy i guess 

554.92 565.06 B: yeah yeah see i just did that where last week i decided i was going to start eating better again and because with me i work full time during the week and then i go to school on the weekends full time

607.87 608.87 A: oh okay 

608.23 616.04 B: it does not taste normal in the microwave and it was okay but it it kinda had like the it reminded me pretty much like a vegetarian hamburger 

615.65 616.54 A: (( mhm )) 

615.88 629.38 B: and you know how there's only certain brands of those you can eat of the veggie burgers it kinda the salisbury steak kinda reminded me of one of the brands i don't like so much [mn] so but i mean the the potatoes were really good [laughter]
