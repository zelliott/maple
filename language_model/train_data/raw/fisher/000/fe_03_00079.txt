52.26 54.42 B: think has some ah 

55.64 62.28 B: insightful value to it but not most of the other shows i don't particularly care for 

63.36 66.46 A: okay so ah what do you like about this 

66.48 67.66 A: survivor 

69.05 70.19 B: uh 

70.33 77.63 B: i like the way that it plays on people's um it tugs at peoples' [lipsmack] 

78.71 79.73 B: their 

79.79 84.03 B: character i guess i would say their their willingness to 

84.12 89.97 B: uh play fair or with dignity or respect or just play 

89.99 92.22 B: outright for a million dollars 

92.76 96.98 B: and disregard honesty and integrity and 

98.60 100.64 A: yeah but 

100.69 101.67 A: i 

101.68 105.13 A: i don't know but i'm not too sure about this kind of um 

105.49 110.15 A: reality shows on the t._v. i think it's too much information to make public 

110.45 112.19 A: don't you agree with me 

111.60 115.98 B: yes i yes to to a great degree i agree wholeheartedly [noise] 

116.89 126.44 A: but still it's so people like to peek into other's personal lives and i mean i think they like it 

127.29 128.16 B: i 

128.18 134.58 B: actually i also like uh some of the challenges that they have i find them interesting but [mn] 

135.47 136.36 B: i 

136.39 139.40 B: don't like the in particular 

139.87 143.43 B: some of the challenges that they give them uh 

143.91 150.35 B: in regards to some of what they may have to eat in order to contend this last particular 

150.46 153.38 B: uh survivor challenge i thought was 

153.39 155.45 B: over the top in that regard 

156.08 164.75 B: um and some of the other reality shows that do the same thing those i'll turn off at those points i [noise] i don't enjoy it any more 

166.12 166.87 A: (( mm )) 

166.56 167.82 B: um 

167.98 170.53 B: the how about the 

170.80 172.15 B: the bachelor 

172.88 174.28 A: excuse me 

173.65 176.12 B: the the showed called the bachelor 

176.00 178.37 A: i've never seen that what's it all about 

177.78 179.07 B: that's uh 

179.63 181.49 B: a single 

181.68 182.90 B: male 

183.00 185.98 B: uh unmarried who's um 

184.25 185.58 A: (( mhm )) 

187.89 189.76 B: [lipsmack] who's put in a position 

189.83 193.11 B: to intermingle date with 

193.77 199.53 B: several different uh also unmarried attractive young females 

199.50 200.39 A: uh-huh 

199.95 206.25 B: and during the course of a period of time i'm not sure if it's six to eight weeks or whatever it is he's 

206.36 208.68 B: he's expected to get to know 

209.25 215.39 B: them and uh dismiss them as he goes along until he comes up with 

215.52 221.07 B: as the show goes along until he comes up with uh one particular female that he thinks he's interested in 

221.63 222.45 A: (( mm )) 

221.75 224.03 B: uh extending a relationship with 

224.55 228.66 B: um and that becomes really uh too 

230.14 233.52 B: too public in regards to personal 

234.21 241.88 A: yeah i would i would agree with that but uh do you think these guys who participate in the show really mean it 

241.69 250.97 A: i think they ju- they are just there because they want popularity and they are not they might not be serious about their whatever they are doing on the screen 

250.76 257.46 B: ah oh yes i also agree with that i think their the majority of it is good acting 

257.43 264.85 A: yeah that's what i would think it's it's a good way to publicize yourself get to you know get on the screen for 

264.86 268.14 A: an hours worth of lot on prime time 

268.20 269.79 B: agreed 

270.06 271.03 A: (( um )) 

271.56 275.79 A: uh but still these are popular i think they are they are 

276.07 281.51 A: people might people inter- people get interested in these um dra- 

281.94 284.37 A: i would call them dramas because 

284.41 285.16 A: they 

285.47 290.04 A: they have a perception that it might be a reality [lipsmack] and 

290.45 299.20 A: that's i think one of the factors that um excites them that i mean this this perception of the reality 

299.70 303.02 B: [mn] [noise] you- you're probably right um 

303.61 314.57 B: the perception of it i think is a good way to word it i and to a great degree i think that it's gonna i think it's gonna phase out very near future i think it's to a great degree i liken it to 

314.94 316.79 B: daytime soaps 

316.70 317.59 A: uh-huh 

317.28 318.29 B: um 

317.65 324.34 A: yeah th- that's that's what i i extremely agree that it's uh it's just like that soap operas 

325.63 328.36 B: they play it over the top what you know 

328.66 329.45 B: (( i )) 

330.26 332.68 B: guess is a phrase that i'm 

333.17 337.63 B: uh familiar with for a long time over the top in trying to 

337.80 339.15 B: attract 

340.09 343.12 B: uh certain age groups i imagine 

346.82 357.28 B: in uh in in in their interests in ah out of the ordinary circumstances and situations i don't really consider it reality i think it's a misnomer in itself 

346.94 347.66 A: wha- 

357.26 364.10 A: uh-huh it's uh yeah that's that's what i was calling the perception of reality it's not actual reality 

365.63 370.31 A: and since since you've raised this topic of the age groups 

370.74 375.49 A: has there been any survey on this kind of um reality shows where they 

375.67 376.71 A: sort of 

376.87 385.70 A: uh study the various age groups to find out their customer base how it's distributed um along the age axis 

385.94 394.64 B: oh i'm sure they have and i'm sure that the advertisers were probably the supporters of that or or the 

392.86 393.44 A: (( mm )) 

394.81 398.11 B: funders of of that study 

398.06 399.95 A: (( mhm )) 

400.89 409.66 A: but but they never publish this kind of information i i i'm not a regular reader of these magazines where they publish these 

409.71 420.52 A: ah new serials and these reality shows and their information but have you ever read these kind of uh magazines where they give this information the various statistics 

420.87 423.60 B: uh no i have not 

423.03 429.46 A: mm but this will be a great thing to look at because i my my guess is that 

429.56 437.23 A: these ah reality shows they will have a very big popular base mostly among young maybe twen- 

437.33 438.09 A: (( ah )) 

438.26 441.14 A: (( ten to twenty year old ten to twenty five )) 

443.14 445.48 B: probably right 

445.53 448.99 B: i that's probably exactly right 

448.20 449.18 A: (( and )) 

449.10 454.41 B: but i think it extends then beyond that age group too but that's probably the biggest percentage of it 

453.88 459.13 A: that's right and i think as you go along like forties or fifties it going to gradually decrease 

458.98 459.85 B: uh-huh 

464.70 467.38 B: um i don't know that i'll watch 

468.16 474.73 B: survivor series after this this particular one and i don't i didn't watch 

475.07 478.31 B: much of or maybe more than 

478.76 483.64 B: half of two different episodes of the bachelor series um 

484.09 486.97 B: [lipsmack] what are some of the other ones uh 

488.75 491.21 B: oh gosh i can't think of it uh 

491.32 492.85 B: fear factor 

493.00 494.29 A: fear factor 

494.24 495.26 B: yes 

494.94 496.10 A: (( mhm )) 

495.54 496.92 B: have you seen that 

497.31 504.49 A: i have may have skimmed i i i usually go get home from work and i would skim the channels and i think i have come across it 

504.72 506.66 A: this this fear factor 

506.40 510.15 B: that's [lipsmack] also another kind of ghastly 

510.64 512.77 B: uh challenge game 

512.19 513.18 A: uh-huh 

513.43 514.91 A: (( oh that's pathetic )) 

515.22 519.39 A: (( [laughter] like i won't get some shows are just too )) 

519.47 524.29 A: i don't know i can't even see it and people would eat anything 

524.18 525.13 B: yes 

524.53 525.96 A: for a couple of dollars 

525.92 533.49 B: or they'd be placed in a in a cage or a glass cage and have um spiders or 

526.02 526.97 A: (( [laughter] )) 

534.15 534.93 B: (( um uh )) 

537.38 543.61 B: other things dumped on them and they'd have to stay in it for a certain length of time 

542.69 544.66 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

544.08 550.06 B: that that becomes again that's like over the top for me too you know [noise] nothing in it 

549.70 550.91 A: (( mhm )) 

550.36 556.94 B: for the amount of money is worth me considering doing ever or watching 

559.22 567.99 A: but but that's th- this is the interesting thing about the show is that it shows how the people would go to any extreme to get money i mean 

568.10 569.16 B: yes 

569.19 577.25 A: and sometimes it's it's more than money also i've seen a lot of people who were straight but they still want to do these crazy things 

577.40 579.99 A: just they just take it as a challenge 

580.44 586.86 B: and perhaps there's a certain desperation in their [noise] lives or something that may cause them to go to such extremes [noise] for 

587.03 592.54 B: that kind of money but i i [noise] in most cases i doubt it 

592.66 594.22 A: (( mhm )) 

601.38 603.62 B: [noise] well do you have anything more 

603.68 614.35 A: well i i would i i see more of t._v. other shows rather than these reality shows i think but [noise] because i'm i'm i'm probably not interested in these kind of shows 

616.77 618.99 A: but i think these are 

620.31 634.02 A: they don't give me the information that i that i want to get out of t- t._v. i would rather see a news channel or the score rather than seeing somebody doing i mean it's it's just the way i prefer 

634.86 637.37 B: and i'm the same in my i'm 

638.32 640.74 B: in my upper forties now so 

640.64 641.77 A: (( mhm )) 

641.16 648.71 B: those you're [noise] right the things you just mentioned are more my main interest for the free time that i have during the course of a day 

648.53 649.61 A: (( mhm )) 

648.99 653.16 B: or a good movie or something when i'm home during the evening 

653.11 654.44 A: (( mhm )) 

654.03 655.62 B: versus these shows 

655.59 657.01 A: (( mhm )) 

661.44 667.35 B: now do we do is there a length of time that that we talk on such 

666.69 669.55 A: yeah that's what i was wondering um 

669.65 671.28 B: because i'm i'm act- 

670.48 673.94 A: maybe just ten minutes i don't but i'm not sure about it 

673.50 677.85 B: okay 'cause i'm actually filling in for my son who signed up 

677.52 678.50 A: uh-huh 

678.42 687.50 B: for this but um he told us about it and had had a couple of good discussions thus far on other topics so uh in 

687.89 690.90 B: lieu of him not being here at the moment i thought that i'd 

691.48 692.42 A: uh-huh 

692.61 698.00 A: yeah it's an hour and five over five now it's been already five minutes i think since we've been talking 

697.55 698.38 B: oh 

698.49 704.93 B: sean and here is the boy now is it is there a length of time ten minutes oh okay 

704.85 708.94 A: okay so we've got to talk for five more minutes [laughter] 

706.76 707.66 B: yes 

708.02 708.98 B: (( [laughter] )) 

709.73 710.89 A: okay 

711.94 713.19 A: so uh 

713.22 719.89 A: okay let's start this way what do you think was the best um survivor that you liked did you like any of the survivor
