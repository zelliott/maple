3.53 4.65 B: how ya doing 

4.28 5.60 A: good how are you 

5.49 6.52 B: good 

6.86 7.76 A: (( my name's )) 

6.92 8.82 B: my name's e- sorry 

8.26 10.13 A: [laughter] what's your name 

9.59 10.59 B: erica 

10.21 11.72 A: hi erica i'm sean 

11.98 13.28 B: how ya doing 

12.99 16.41 A: i'm okay i'm not sick that's for sure 

16.30 17.95 B: [mn] yeah i'm not either 

17.47 19.55 A: that's good 

18.54 22.25 B: i'm uh crossing my fingers that i won't get sick 

22.31 26.24 A: that's good i do sometimes um 

26.42 30.79 A: it seems to be actually like when seasons change or something like that 

30.90 32.24 A: sometimes 

32.06 34.76 B: you really think it's affected by that 

34.70 38.65 A: um i think so by 

38.88 52.22 A: like say weather and things you know if if it gets colder then it seems to me that for some reason that i notice that uh it's not just myself getting sick more people around me are getting sick 

41.21 42.15 B: uh-huh 

52.25 63.73 B: i think the difference is that like when the weather gets cold people close the windows so you're breathing more of everybody's germs rather than getting fresh air inside so it's not so much like 

61.29 62.70 A: yeah that's a 

64.16 66.53 B: a factor of the weather it's like 

67.28 68.49 B: it is 

69.23 71.67 B: i don't know some secondary cause 

71.39 74.13 A: yeah it's indirect cause 

73.94 75.03 B: (( there you go )) 

74.41 87.65 A: i i didn't think of that but i i was thinking that especially when it gets colder i know that um it doesn't it doesn't affect germs i think germs grow better or something when it's colder or something like 

87.90 90.28 A: (( that but )) 

88.59 89.30 B: hm 

89.49 90.94 B: (( i don't know about that )) 

91.59 98.71 B: but i try to keep myself you know free from the germs and wash wash your hands often that's what they say 

98.96 101.09 A: i surely do that i 

100.59 101.84 B: uh-huh [laughter] 

101.57 108.99 A: mean i can try and remind myself to wash my hands so that you know i'm not sick and i don't miss work or 

108.93 112.01 B: yeah i'm totally paranoid about it at work 

112.47 118.23 B: i wash my hands so often and use like antibacterial gel because someone's always sneezing 

117.83 119.13 A: yeah 

118.62 122.10 B: and it's just so easy to pick it up 

121.70 127.75 A: yeah especially when you go to public places like baseball games or you know sporting events or 

127.72 128.83 B: yeah 

128.04 134.17 A: movies or something the mall or you know uh there's germs everywhere on doorknobs and stuff so 

134.26 136.79 A: it's i read in a 

136.81 139.08 A: magazine called the bottom line 

139.17 139.94 B: uh-huh 

139.57 143.49 A: um that washing your hands is by far the number one 

143.55 147.29 A: way to prevent yourself from getting sick so 

146.71 147.49 B: uh-huh 

148.13 149.89 A: i definitely do that 

149.86 151.15 B: yeah 

150.51 152.36 A: i try and eat healthy too 

152.41 153.33 B: do you 

152.97 154.37 A: yeah 

153.99 155.24 B: i do also 

155.93 161.35 B: i'm a vegetarian but i don't know if that's so much for my health it's just like a preference 

160.59 164.95 A: well i i think it helps you at least watch your diet you know 

164.60 165.54 B: uh-huh 

165.13 167.87 A: and you eat well so that's good 

168.51 178.45 A: it seems to me that people that uh don't eat like vegetables and get vitamins and or take vitamins and things like that then they get sicker more often 

178.71 184.32 B: yeah well you don't have the like natural defenses to to fight it off 

183.88 185.41 A: definitely 

186.14 190.16 A: but then there ha- there's seems to be like other people that 

190.33 192.60 A: there's just about nothing they can do 

193.02 200.99 A: like a friend that when i went to college um he was sick all the time he had and then the next week he had like 

201.11 208.46 A: uh one time he [mn] pneumonia and then he he would just have a cold and everything all the time 

204.70 205.57 B: (( [mn] )) 

209.47 210.26 B: (( [laughter] it's )) 

210.55 211.76 B: gotta be 

212.21 214.13 B: probably not very fun [laughter] 

213.44 215.06 A: no not at all 

214.31 216.18 B: (( to be sick all the time )) 

215.69 218.28 A: yeah live your whole life sick [mn] 

217.73 219.03 B: yeah no kidding 

220.54 222.58 B: bad genes maybe uh-huh 

221.82 224.17 A: yeah that's true 

225.61 228.18 A: well do you consider like 

228.35 229.39 A: um 

230.28 243.03 A: like if you went out and you were drinking all night long or something and then you were um throwing up and stuff would you consider that being sick or just no not really yeah 

240.19 241.17 B: no 

241.26 244.21 B: that's different i mean that's making yourself sick 

243.68 250.71 A: yeah very true but you're yeah but you're still sick then maybe 

246.38 247.60 B: yeah 

250.63 257.39 B: yeah i mean you get like the symptoms but it's not like a bacteria or a germ cause 

252.57 253.67 A: (( right )) 

258.48 260.94 B: so- i mean that's something you could have prevented 

261.56 263.15 B: you did it to yourself 

262.57 263.58 A: (( [mn] )) 

265.84 266.79 B: (( uh )) 

268.40 270.74 B: but you know sometimes you just 

270.99 277.94 B: get a bit sick like so many people i know friends of my family are so si- ill right now 

278.46 279.32 B: and it's 

280.44 286.08 B: it's just a very sad story and because there's nothing you can do to protect yourself against it like 

282.63 283.52 A: huh 

286.72 287.96 B: cancer 

288.10 289.55 A: oh i know 

289.33 290.36 B: (( you know )) 

290.56 291.52 B: (( so like )) 

292.67 296.03 B: there keeps there's always studies and the is like 

296.07 303.83 B: if you eat broccoli then you're going to protect yourself against this sort of cancer but then it's going to cause this other kind of cancer it doesn't make 

300.21 301.17 A: yeah 

302.77 303.59 A: yeah 

304.62 305.91 B: (( any kind of sense )) 

305.95 309.47 A: well i i heard on the news the other day that 

309.51 311.69 A: they had like a vaccine 

311.94 315.74 A: uh especially for women that um you could take 

316.25 319.72 A: uh that would prevent uh cervical cancer 

320.03 321.21 B: (( oh really )) 

320.05 332.57 A: which i yeah i thought was very cool i mean like cancer's probably like the most one of the most deadly diseases that we have and you know and it's very sickly and things so i think it's cool that 

332.33 333.23 B: uh-huh 

332.90 335.97 A: they're making strides to help prevent it and 

335.59 338.53 B: i'd be curious to see how that worked out in the long run 

338.03 339.77 A: yeah 

339.83 343.15 A: that's all i know is that they did a study and they 

343.39 351.74 A: gave a bunch of women pills and the ones they gave 'em to they didn't get cervical cancer but the other ones did or something so that was the 

351.62 353.37 B: uh-huh 

356.11 357.46 B: well [sigh] 

356.58 361.56 A: basis of that do you live in uh like an urban area or suburban or rural 

360.70 363.20 B: no i live in a city 

363.57 365.26 A: yeah i live in 

365.46 368.11 A: rural rural area so 

367.93 369.15 B: oh yeah 

368.48 371.08 A: yeah i kinda think that uh 

371.74 372.63 A: um 

374.19 376.22 A: people get sicker 

376.45 381.22 A: i i'm not sure if people more people would be sick in the city or 

381.41 384.81 B: well it's more people in a lot closer quarters 

384.56 385.73 A: yeah 

385.14 390.08 B: i think there's much more opportunity to you know to pick things up 

389.48 393.07 A: yeah but i also wonder if you did like 

393.45 398.01 A: you know like a per capita percentage study or something 

397.53 398.51 B: uh-huh 

397.92 412.36 A: if like the same you know say there's fifty people that live around me and then there's five hundred people that live around you if there's you know a hundred people that are sick that live around you but only you know there's there's ten that live around me that are sick 

405.28 406.06 B: uh-huh 

412.04 412.97 B: (( sure [mn] )) 

412.57 415.00 A: that's the same kind of percentage so 

415.53 417.82 A: i don't i guess that would mean 

417.99 424.18 A: you can't really make a correlation out of it i wonder if if a correlation can be made between the city and 

424.24 425.58 B: that's a good question 

426.67 427.49 B: but 

428.34 430.34 B: i don't know i i don't 

430.59 433.69 B: feel like i get sick more often 

434.20 437.35 B: since i've lived in the city and i've lived here for 

437.89 439.34 B: like six years 

439.38 440.10 A: (( mm )) 

439.91 444.61 B: but it could also be that i just keep better care of myself 

444.01 445.30 A: yeah 

445.00 446.41 B: (( than i used to )) 

446.59 447.85 B: i feel like 

447.92 451.04 B: as i get older and i'm not very old but 

451.08 455.65 B: i just feel that it's increasingly important to take care of myself 

455.30 456.31 A: yes 

456.08 459.09 B: 'cause you start to realize your own mortality 

458.73 459.99 A: yeah 

460.61 461.32 B: (( but )) 

462.00 464.79 B: i don't know if i definitely feel that that's 

465.08 468.41 B: (( the direction my life is heading in and i don't know )) 

469.00 470.04 B: need to 

471.33 474.32 B: eat right and watch your weight and 

474.79 480.85 B: because i intend to like live a long and healthy life and that's how i plan to do it 

480.15 482.13 A: yeah i'd like to 

482.39 485.44 A: as far as i can see if you eat healthy and um 

485.95 491.19 A: and you know do your best to stay healthy then you will for a long time 

490.66 491.34 B: (( mm )) 

493.30 494.34 A: (( so but )) 

493.40 496.35 B: but then again you could get hit by a car [mn] 

495.49 496.78 A: yeah i know 

496.85 498.57 A: in the next ten minutes 

498.25 499.34 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

498.83 500.66 A: yeah 

500.77 501.72 A: uh 

502.06 507.18 A: what about when you you know you are sick like do you just have a cold or something 

506.58 507.44 B: uh-huh 

507.33 510.78 A: what kinda things do you do to try and get rid of your cold i mean 

510.83 516.53 A: do you take all kinds of pills and drugs and or what what do you do to try and get rid of them 

515.89 520.35 B: i don't know i'm [sigh] i'm actually i when i get a cold 

520.58 524.21 B: i get i feel reluctant to take the medicine 

523.81 525.01 A: yeah 

524.42 525.53 B: because 

525.76 527.76 B: even if it like 

528.11 534.32 B: helps the symptoms go away you still feel like groggy and horrible 

533.79 535.29 A: yeah 

534.64 536.76 B: and i'd rather be clear headed 

536.62 542.27 A: that's the way i feel like i'd rather not take like you know drugs and stuff just 'cause 

542.50 549.58 A: i don't know a lot of times i feel like that's all so expensive and it seems to be like a psychological thing 

546.83 547.79 B: uh-huh 

549.29 553.26 B: yeah sometimes it is and like a cup of tea will do the same thing 

552.83 557.50 A: yeah it's like oh i can i'm doing something to help myself you know 

557.23 558.12 B: uh-huh 

557.73 562.41 A: and then your mind tells yourself or som- that's the way it seems to be anyways 

563.12 567.23 A: [sigh] i know that if i have just like a cold and um 

567.89 569.63 A: i'll just drink 

569.70 573.89 A: water i mean like probably two gallons of water a day 

573.67 575.99 B: yeah you have to hydrate yourself 

575.44 581.06 A: yeah just so i'm going to the bathroom all the time and it flushes my system out 

580.52 582.45 B: do you take vitamins or anything 

582.29 583.38 A: um 

583.68 585.13 A: usually i don't 

586.23 588.00 A: i tried and it 

586.47 587.40 B: (( i kno- )) 

587.55 588.11 B: (( [mn] )) 

588.22 591.42 A: doesn't seem to make any difference so i don't know just 

590.83 595.41 B: yeah like i know people who swear by echinacea do you know what that is 

594.83 596.06 A: yeah 

595.82 597.33 B: and uh i don't know 

597.42 601.44 B: i don't feel that that's like [mn] really very beneficial 

601.19 602.21 A: (( i know )) 

601.94 605.83 B: [laughter] just because it never really made a difference like when i tried it 

605.92 612.44 A: my mom i think my mom uses that and that again that's where i think it's like more one of those like 

612.23 614.01 B: psychological things 

612.81 616.17 A: yeah just what you make yourself believe in 

616.78 618.48 A: uh you know 

619.16 624.34 A: and a lot of these companies have ads out oh this will make you better and everything else you know 

624.50 627.24 A: and then they pay celebrities or 

627.05 627.98 B: [laughter] 

627.31 628.76 A: they're people that 

628.82 633.60 A: advertise for 'em and then oh that must be great stuff then [mn] 

633.67 634.96 B: yeah that's true 

634.99 639.46 B: it's all abou- it's all about like the commercialization and the 

640.52 642.98 B: privatization of drug companies 

642.42 643.81 A: oh god they're h- 

643.12 646.10 B: but it's holy cow [laughter] 

645.53 647.65 A: god they're horrible at it 

647.08 649.06 B: yeah 

647.73 649.49 A: it's sickening 

649.59 654.09 A: that they you know they obviously take advantage of people and just 

653.51 660.59 B: absolutely i mean putting prescription pills on advertisements on the t._v. is just beyond my comprehension 

660.23 661.90 A: yeah 

661.01 661.69 B: (( i )) 

661.71 665.77 B: i can't believe it they're allowed to do that [mn] 

665.14 675.69 A: they're all over all the time and that every other day every day i'm seeing a new add for a new kind of pill or drug or something to help and they never explain like what it's for 

667.08 667.93 B: (( i know )) 

674.95 676.79 B: [laughter] 

675.81 679.50 A: it's like oh go see your doctor and find out well 

679.87 680.76 A: see 

679.93 682.63 B: okay they shouldn't bring that up you know 

682.20 686.41 A: and you know what that does it has people go see their doctor and it uh 

686.55 698.86 A: y- i don't know for me but for me it's like five dollars to go see my doctor or something you know some people might be twenty but they just wanna go and find out and that's the only way to find out about it for some people you know 

691.42 692.29 B: uh-huh 

698.92 707.15 B: yeah or they want the doctor to say you know oh that'll cure this thing and then they'll think the people will go oh well you know sign me up [laughter] 

706.74 708.03 A: yeah 

708.28 712.66 A: so these insurance companies are making all this money in medical 

711.20 712.20 B: yeah 

713.20 714.21 A: (( [mn] god )) 

715.02 716.22 B: (( so uh )) 

716.74 719.89 B: [mn] we're a big the only industrialized nation that doesn't have
