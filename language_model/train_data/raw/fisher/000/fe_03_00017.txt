0.09 1.69 B: (( hi i'm matt )) 

1.59 3.32 A: hi i'm maria 

3.52 4.46 B: hi maria 

5.04 6.07 A: so uh 

6.35 9.94 A: a- are you uh where is where there's snow 

10.20 12.67 A: because it's really heavy snow around here 

12.79 15.25 B: oh yeah lots of snow is falling 

15.33 20.66 A: so not good for health [laughter] i try not to go out too much 

20.96 25.96 B: no yeah i'm not used to snow although it's really pretty to look at 

25.00 26.73 A: (( oh yeah it's very pretty )) 

26.74 28.34 A: do you um 

28.21 30.94 B: so this this topic it's uh 

31.02 34.68 B: illness colds what was uh did you understand it 

34.09 40.03 A: yeah i think i think we're supposed to talk about what we do to keep out um 

40.15 53.87 A: you know if you know seasonally there's supposed to be more illness i guess if there's a cold or allergies or whatever and whatever we're supposed to do to stay out of it and you know what we think about it and the doctors and et cetera et cetera [mn] 

54.03 55.77 B: oh okay hm 

54.92 58.86 A: that's why i mentioned snow [laughter] i'm trying to stay with the topic um 

59.13 66.66 A: so uh actually i was going to um get a flu shot this season it would be my first i haven't actually never done this before but i know a lot of people do 

66.89 68.22 A: do you ever do it 

69.24 79.52 B: actually i think that that uh every every time i've known someone who got a flu shot or actually no i can't say everybody my grandma 

79.71 83.07 B: every year the doctor would tell her to get a flu shot because she's elderly 

83.19 91.02 B: and she would always obey the doctor and go and get it and then immediately afterwards she would get really sick and i've never seen 

83.49 84.48 A: right 

89.17 89.98 A: huh 

91.05 96.41 B: the flu shot really have any effect i mean she comes down with the flu anyways every season 

96.59 100.79 B: and usually it's pretty bad i mean she's down for a couple of weeks so 

100.78 103.49 A: is that after the shot or or uh 

101.02 102.02 B: uh 

103.55 112.98 A: you know some time after the shot because the way the shot's supposed to work i think is isn't it and then you're supposed to get a little probably a little cold after the after the shot itself 

113.77 118.29 B: no it's not it's not immediately after it's like a couple of weeks after or 

117.96 119.39 A: yeah 

119.58 127.86 A: well maybe you know that's not exactly a scientific experiment i mean you know maybe she gets less sick than she would if she didn't get the shot [mn] 

127.95 132.13 B: it's possible but given that kind of track record 

132.18 139.67 B: especially knowing what the flu is it's a rapidly mutating virus how can they how can they prepare a vaccine for that 

138.66 146.27 A: that's true [sigh] i don't know i'm just a little bit paranoid this this uh winter just want to make sure that i 

144.99 147.78 B: did they say that the flu is going to be real bad 

148.04 156.95 A: i don't know actually i haven't heard but my husband and i are trying to have a child so it's not a good time not a good time to get it you know to get a flu so 

152.79 154.62 B: oh yeah 

156.95 169.25 A: [sigh] just want to make sure you know i'm all prepared and everything but actually generally i i do generally get some sort of a cold every winter i think um i actually had pneumonia when i was really li- um i think uh 

169.37 170.95 A: nine or so 

170.68 172.04 B: mhm 

171.43 174.53 A: and it was it lasted for six months so it was 

174.34 175.09 B: (( ew )) 

174.48 189.28 A: pre- pretty bad well this was in the soviet union and it was misdiagnosed as bronchitis and so it wasn't treated properly and you know et cetera et cetera [mn] so um i've been sort of getting sick every winter since then so maybe that's i don't know if that's really it or not [mn] 

189.31 191.10 B: what do you do when you get sick 

191.45 193.22 B: just rest it off or 

191.74 192.76 A: well 

193.36 199.75 A: i used i used to just not really do much i'm i'm not much a believer in in medi- in medicine 

199.67 200.53 B: uh-huh 

199.88 202.50 A: um i guess that comes from you know 

202.51 214.83 A: from where i'm from you you don't usually take a lot of drugs like [mn] american's do [laughter] so my first my first instinct is not to take something so i usually just you know drink warm you know tea or milk 

207.61 208.46 B: yeah 

214.96 220.04 A: and uh sleep and you know but uh since i married my husband he kinda 

219.86 230.71 A: introduced nyquil into our lives so [laughter] i sort of g- i've been going that route because you know as you get older you don't wanna be sick because not because of the health i mean that too but 

222.03 223.14 B: [laughter] 

230.48 242.89 A: you don't wanna you know when you're a child you wanna miss school so you you know you don't want to get treated but when you're adults you don't want to miss work and all the other engagements so you're more pressured to get healthy more quickly [laughter] 

237.62 238.45 B: right 

242.37 243.21 B: right 

243.30 244.59 A: do you do anything 

246.11 249.81 B: i usually take something to control the symptoms 

250.38 258.90 B: uh and otherwise i just sleep and drink lots of fluids i don't like to go to the doctor unless i begin to suspect that it's it's uh 

259.75 261.19 A: something more serious 

260.03 262.58 B: a pretty serious infection yeah 

262.08 262.67 A: (( mm )) 

263.49 270.72 A: yeah since i guess that i had i had pneumonia so i think i have a pretty good handle on what you know its pretty serious symptom 

270.75 278.28 A: symptoms mean so if i don't get them which usually i don't i don't go to the doctor either it's like the same thing with the with medicine i don't 

278.41 279.64 B: yeah 

278.48 286.63 A: go to the i don't think of the doctor as something that you know that's like for emergencies and you know for unbearable pain and that sort of thing [laughter] 

285.89 289.55 B: yeah well it has to be for me it has to be 

290.08 295.75 B: a sore throat accompanied by fever and nausea that goes over about four days 

295.90 298.62 B: or an extremely sore throat that goes over two 

298.85 303.11 A: i don't actually i don't i don't think i usually think of sore throat 

299.30 300.98 B: (( before i'll worry about it )) 

303.07 315.41 A: as like a serious unless i can feel it's in my you know in my chest because i know that that just means that it's pretty serious it's like you know this is what the doctor listens to when you go to the doctor he listens if you have any 

307.80 308.60 B: (( mhm )) 

315.34 318.84 A: you know serious um i don't know what the word is 

318.99 329.96 A: like uh sounds in in your chest because that means there's something more wrong but you know if i don't hear it myself it's usually if you take a really deep breath y- you know if it hurts then 

322.24 323.37 B: okay 

328.97 330.17 B: you can tell 

330.12 331.04 A: yeah 

331.36 339.47 A: otherwise i just drink you know tea and and milk with butter which i absolutely hate and it's like for me it's it's a symptom 

332.37 332.93 B: (( [cough] )) 

339.41 344.45 A: you know it's something that's associated with a cold so i i hate it which is by the way i 

344.36 348.87 A: why i hate popcorn because it has exactly the same smell [laughter] 

347.50 349.35 B: [laughter] 

348.69 363.26 A: i just you know like i said i had pneumonia for six months you can imagine how much you know warm fluid i had to consume and and milk with butter is just not [laughter] i really hate it [laughter] the same goes by the way for tea with uh 

354.84 356.26 B: yeah 

357.80 358.70 B: yeah 

363.16 364.37 A: with uh 

364.76 368.83 A: raspberry which was also like a russian remedy 

366.63 367.51 B: huh 

369.18 373.07 B: tea with raspberry that's interesting here it's chicken soup 

369.52 370.21 A: so 

370.54 371.35 A: yeah 

373.79 376.79 B: everyone always has chicken soup whenever they get sick 

373.84 374.89 A: yeah 

375.41 376.62 A: yeah that too 

377.47 387.82 A: i i wasn't surprised with that it sort of seems to be an international kind of uh cure [laughter] it's like kind of always interesting to observe the you know the 

382.18 383.11 B: huh 

387.70 394.76 A: home remedies of different countries and see if they're similar or you know the ways in which they're different and 

393.88 397.02 B: yeah now peppermint tea i can imagine 

397.17 398.28 A: which tea 

398.13 399.35 B: peppermint tea 

399.00 401.42 A: (( peppermint tea i don't think i've ever tried that )) 

399.92 400.82 B: yeah 

402.23 404.49 A: that's is yeah i don't know 

404.44 409.23 A: i i wonder if we're tal- supposed to talk just about the colds or about other seasonal 

409.17 422.28 A: you know stuff like i don't know al- allergies i guess would be the the you know seasonal stuff i've never had them so i i never i never give it much thought [laughter] it's just how when i see all those incessant advertisements on the t._v. 

422.47 425.62 A: that there seems to be i guess a lot of people who are affected by it 

425.89 427.35 A: (( judging by the a- )) 

426.07 429.53 B: yeah hay fever hay fever bothers a lot of people 

427.86 428.76 A: yeah 

430.08 432.15 A: yeah do y- do you suffer 

430.97 435.42 B: it's usually only twice a year yeah i do i've had that since i was a kid 

435.23 437.23 A: yeah see like i 

436.01 437.47 B: usually 

437.49 438.55 A: go ahead 

438.59 440.87 B: usually you can just i can 

440.97 443.62 B: when i was a kid i worried about controlling it more 

444.06 456.16 B: because i really hated it but then i got older and i just kind of ignore it now occasionally i'll take benadryl it becomes kind of like a cold except you don't have a fever you just itchy watery eyes 

447.95 449.34 A: is it like a cold 

454.07 455.92 A: you sneeze and yeah 

457.04 461.74 B: sneezing sometimes coughing a lot of mucus in the throat 

461.93 465.71 B: uh it's a pain it's mostly just a nuisance 

466.09 477.01 A: yeah actually i yeah i hate that that's i don't know that's truly awful like you feel really powerless because there's nothing that really treats that [laughter] it's like the 

475.91 479.72 B: mostly you just drink a lot that's about the only thing i've seen 

480.23 481.44 B: because uh 

480.37 481.32 A: (( i mean do y- )) 

481.85 489.28 B: benadryl and the like uh benadryl will knock you out um most of the decongestants make me grumpy 

490.06 494.85 B: uh so sometimes the medicine is worse than just taking 

494.92 495.92 A: (( yeah )) 

494.98 496.41 B: it living with it 

496.18 507.91 A: yeah i used to take uh some sort of uh antihistamine for my cold and i only i i noticed that i only could take it i- uh at night because otherwise i wouldn't be able to do anything i'd be like a zombie 

508.80 514.72 A: do you take the uh like brand stuff or do you do you not care 

515.05 515.72 A: [mn] 

516.08 517.41 A: in terms of medicine 

516.65 527.50 B: i guess mostly brand stuff but it's not because i care it's just because i go into the store and i recognize the names and so i pick it up i guess it's 

528.71 535.91 A: my father he's uh he's actually not a doctor but he worked in at a medical institute in he was always interested in 

535.98 540.25 A: you know like home medicines he was sort of our family first uh 

540.29 553.96 A: um you know defense [laughter] and uh and he uh kind of told us what medicine to buy when when my brother and i left home and i kind of stuck with them [laughter] and they're usually like non brand stuff because 

542.50 543.33 B: mhm 

554.12 566.79 A: you know as long as you know what the ingredients are because you know if you c- if you look you can see most of them have exactly the same ingredients just maybe like the strengths may be different and uh yeah i don't know 

556.75 558.18 B: right 

564.40 565.32 B: right 

566.86 569.51 A: it's kinda funny that about the cold that uh 

569.68 573.25 A: it's been around for so many years and i mean centuries i should say 

573.95 579.66 A: still not much progress you know [laughter] made into you know it's even made into the 

580.26 584.91 A: proverb you know cure for a common cold and [laughter] 

584.11 587.96 B: yeah well people have been wrestling with it for a long time i guess 

588.26 591.57 A: hm so i wonder how long we're supposed to stay on this topic since uh 

592.14 594.09 A: i think we've covered almost everything 

592.20 599.21 B: i think it was ten minutes or is it sup- does it automatically shut off after a certain amount of time or 

597.43 603.39 A: i don't know i don't know if if we're supposed to finish it or does it this is the first time i'm doing this 

603.16 604.04 B: huh 

603.78 604.91 A: is it for you 

604.99 606.18 B: yeah 

605.67 610.33 A: okay so [laughter] we both don't know how this is supposed to end mm [laughter] 

610.38 611.50 A: let's see 

610.59 613.92 B: well how long have we been talking because it said ten minutes 

614.02 616.83 B: i thought that it would shut down after ten minutes but 

617.44 618.38 A: um 

618.98 630.59 A: i it's been close to close to ten minutes because i picked up the phone around five i don't think it's been ten minutes completely [laughter] which reminds me i don't know if you watch uh friends 

630.71 634.13 A: but uh there was an episode you know friends the show right 

633.75 635.13 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

634.57 637.56 A: uh there was a new episode yesterday in uh 

638.35 640.13 A: (( um i don't know if you know the characters but )) 

640.24 644.80 A: you know ross met another guy who was a boyfriend of his 

644.61 657.81 A: friend for a beer and they had absolutely nothing to talk about and they just stand you know like half an hour just uh you know in ten minutes you're sort of staring into the ceiling and and trying to find a topic to talk about [laughter] 

657.32 658.14 B: huh 

657.62 660.92 A: did y- did you look at the list of the topics for this uh 

661.64 667.82 B: yeah there was illness food uh oh what else was there i forget what they were 

668.00 670.59 B: actually they've got it on the website 

671.09 680.09 A: yeah i couldn't for some i misplaced the link um do you think we should try to stick with the topic for the next three minutes and see if you know if this doesn't go off by itself then 

680.79 682.52 B: then i guess hang up 

681.09 684.17 A: (( we can just yeah just hang up all right )) 

684.19 686.17 A: what else haven't we covered [laughter] 

686.47 688.91 B: gargling with salt water that works 

688.08 694.45 A: oh yeah actually no that's funny i was going to mention that but we don't do it with uh salt water we do it with baking soda 

694.87 697.85 B: oh i've not tried that 

695.69 696.65 A: (( i wonder )) 

696.91 698.26 A: (( i wonder if )) 

698.70 701.96 A: (( if if it was just the uh like the abrasive )) 

702.20 703.14 A: um 

703.56 712.14 A: uh powder that that works or because both of you know both salt and and uh baking soda are a bit abrasive i don't know if that's 

712.60 719.10 A: the reason for why both of them seem to work because yeah baking soda works for me i've never tried it with salt 

719.26 719.90 B: yeah
