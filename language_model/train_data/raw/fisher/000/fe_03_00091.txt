51.35 51.83 B: um 

52.54 55.79 B: just you know stuff produced because it's so cheap to produce (( )) but 

56.04 58.83 B: i've never really experienced it first hand 

57.63 58.01 A: well 

58.17 59.72 A: yeah obviously there are 

59.82 63.58 A: some that are really really really bad like 

63.68 67.10 A: uh you know like boot camp and (( )) 

66.49 67.61 B: what is that one 

67.64 68.69 A: there was like it was like 

68.79 80.47 A: people they take people off to this like boot camp and like do boot camp type stuff to them and then get like eliminated if they can't handle it and there is like temptation island which is just trash it's like 

79.12 81.55 B: heard about that one 

81.13 82.55 A: it's like yeah it's like 

82.72 85.44 A: here we are going to take these couples and try and like 

85.69 90.32 A: split them up basically it's but i the ones i like are more 

86.38 87.24 B: right 

90.61 90.90 A: like 

91.32 94.78 A: where they put people in a situation where they have no 

95.07 95.56 A: other 

95.80 98.28 A: choice but to like interact with the other people that are there 

98.38 101.60 A: like that's how they have like big brother is kind of like that too 

100.95 101.51 B: mhm 

101.69 104.15 B: like where they are in a house and it's they are filming out of it 

102.90 108.22 A: they are in a house and there is no t._v. there is no radio there is no outside like external 

108.78 109.20 B: right 

109.06 109.56 A: you know 

109.95 117.14 A: it is all internal and they just go it's it's almost like you know how do they not go crazy (( )) 

115.70 124.04 B: right especially i mean i have always wondered you know having those cameras and sort of camera crews there all the time wouldn't that you know effect they way they acted 

123.10 123.69 A: yeah 

124.52 127.73 B: and people when people talk about them potentially acting 

127.93 129.33 B: real or naturally 

129.52 134.88 B: i don't know i (( )) if i had like twenty five camera men following me around all the time i i would either like 

135.06 140.16 B: completely shut down or do all sorts of like really crazy stuff (( )) 

138.30 138.70 A: yeah 

139.56 141.75 A: well i don't know i think you probably like 

141.86 143.25 A: i'm sure at first 

143.37 147.63 A: it's really weird i mean and and like in big brother they can't see the camera 

147.83 149.37 A: cameras because they are all like behind 

148.38 149.23 B: oh 

149.62 149.93 A: like 

150.31 151.98 A: you know mirrored glass and stuff but 

151.55 152.18 B: i see 

152.51 155.92 A: but they can hear them they know they are running and everything but i 

156.15 159.00 A: it is probably after you are there for a while you are just 

159.35 160.99 A: you know it's just another thing 

160.78 161.22 B: right 

161.19 163.03 A: you know it's just there in the background 

163.51 164.24 A: i mean that's 

164.75 166.01 A: i'm sure people who have like 

166.30 167.99 A: webcams you know and they are on 

168.39 169.75 A: some on the internet and they're 

169.24 172.27 B: yeah you get used to it i guess yeah 

170.77 174.57 A: they probably just get used to cameras being there and they don't even notice it anymore 

174.52 175.47 B: right 

175.40 175.90 A: i mean 

176.32 179.51 A: (( )) i kind of equate it to like if you live near a train 

179.90 181.60 A: and people visit you and they are like 

182.15 185.98 A: how can you sleep with a train and you are like i don't even notice it anymore (( )) 

183.27 183.94 B: yeah 

184.10 185.25 B: (( )) 

185.54 185.90 B: right 

186.61 195.54 B: well then i mean i guess (( as well )) like if if the filming for the program is only a few weeks or months or something at a time people probably see it as like this special 

195.69 198.53 B: like camp or some thing they are going to and it's like 

197.21 197.77 A: yeah 

199.05 200.07 B: (( )) not exactly 

200.51 202.16 B: because they are giving it (( )) 

200.55 201.25 A: well and i think 

201.50 204.97 A: the good ones will probably last for a really long time because 

205.62 207.92 A: they are always changing that is the thing is like 

207.35 207.87 B: right 

208.12 209.08 A: t._v. nowadays 

209.56 209.99 A: (( is so )) 

210.09 210.59 A: stupid 

210.89 212.45 A: most of the time because it's like 

212.68 214.82 A: the same stuff over and over and over again 

214.00 214.65 B: right 

215.21 217.52 A: where as b. shows tend to be like new 

218.01 218.45 A: you know it's 

218.72 221.17 A: it is like new cast new ideas 

221.09 221.52 B: right 

221.52 224.78 A: because i mean you can't help it (( it's all )) put new people in there 

225.24 225.55 A: it's not 

225.68 231.00 A: the cast of friends for the tenth year and we have seen you all (( before for four million times )) you know 

227.00 227.99 B: right 

229.34 230.02 B: uh-huh 

230.93 234.43 B: and do you find that like as the the cast of the shows change the 

234.78 239.49 B: the dynamics and what what goes on and what people talk about really do change significantly enough or 

238.08 239.10 A: oh totally 

239.70 240.66 A: because like last 

239.74 240.15 B: (( )) 

240.80 243.28 A: year's survivor which was on um 

243.79 245.81 A: (( thailand )) i forget where it was like in 

245.54 245.85 B: mhm 

246.01 246.77 A: pacific coast 

246.94 247.87 A: the pacific ocean 

248.38 252.86 A: and they have like a couple really really religious people on the island 

253.12 253.43 B: hm 

253.47 254.70 A: and that really 

255.14 258.21 A: altered and actually they were the two final people 

258.14 258.61 B: wow 

258.85 259.33 A: and 

259.60 264.14 A: that really changed like the whole atmosphere of the island where as like 

262.99 264.34 B: (( )) 

264.80 265.35 A: you know 

265.49 272.02 A: a couple years before that they had like all these like you know totally different people they were very modern and you know 

272.13 273.94 A: most of them were from cities and 

273.64 274.04 B: right 

274.45 275.86 A: so i mean it totally 

276.42 280.90 A: and there is always like the one woman who such a bitch and everyone hates 

281.09 281.39 A: but 

281.64 282.30 A: it's like 

282.44 283.02 A: yeah 

283.17 283.74 A: i i think 

283.84 284.13 A: that's 

284.27 285.58 A: why people really 

286.07 288.01 A: watch that show still even though it's like 

288.12 288.58 A: (( )) 

288.72 289.43 A: even now 

289.60 290.04 B: right 

290.00 290.28 A: because 

290.67 293.96 A: because it is always different it's always in a different location 

294.84 295.71 A: you know they had 

295.93 298.70 A: same basic as far as like challenges and stuff like that but 

299.51 300.30 A: you know it 

301.50 306.11 A: new people you don't know what they are going to do you don't know who is going to fight with who and 

303.30 303.92 B: right 

306.46 306.86 B: yeah 

306.58 306.95 A: so 

307.17 310.55 B: but i i guess it also i mean it seems that you know you have the new people and and 

310.76 312.14 B: and what not but they do 

312.49 314.44 B: (( seem )) to fit into certain sort of 

314.71 320.23 B: narrative frameworks and stuff that the the producers really construct and so maybe it's not so 

316.68 317.78 A: well yeah 

320.57 323.32 B: i mean maybe the things that people are doing on camera at the moment are sort of 

323.50 329.91 B: what they are doing by choice but sort of the whole structure of it is so heavily edited it seems that 

329.54 332.84 A: yeah and i've heard i mean i have heard like when they watch it 

333.45 337.53 A: you know those people that are on the show are like well yeah they made that scene 

334.61 335.11 B: right 

337.64 342.57 A: (( )) you know worse than it was or because of the way it was edited so 

339.54 340.26 B: yeah 

342.77 343.19 A: you know 

343.64 344.54 A: i i am sure that 

344.66 345.94 A: true and everything but 

345.94 346.40 B: right 

346.27 347.07 A: i don't know 

347.31 348.61 A: i mean they can't really like just 

348.88 351.79 A: air hundreds and hundreds of hours of film 

350.04 353.13 B: yes i mean (( )) right 

352.34 355.33 A: here is some doing lots of boring stuff like 

355.47 356.94 A: going to the restroom and 

364.49 365.00 A: probably 

365.09 366.38 A: i i mean 

366.50 368.07 A: they do show i mean they h- 

368.23 373.39 A: definitely show like everyday stuff that they do but i mean obviously they are not going to show you know 

373.53 376.73 B: right somebody urinating on camera 

373.84 374.20 A: (( )) 

374.40 381.25 A: eight hours that they spend you (( peeling )) logs or something (( )) 

377.76 378.73 B: right right 

381.72 383.88 A: no they tend not to i mean they 

384.20 386.47 A: they do show like water runs and 

386.75 390.48 A: stuff like that you know they go to have to do but usually 

387.75 388.13 B: right 

391.04 392.54 A: while they are going 

393.05 394.36 A: to get the water 

394.57 397.98 A: they are also talking or they have they like cut to a 

396.44 396.98 B: right 

398.27 399.33 A: confessional 

399.15 400.24 B: mhm 

399.59 402.79 A: scene or (( )) where they are talking about stuff and it's just like 

403.39 405.11 A: to make it flow better 

404.77 405.23 B: right 

405.79 407.11 A: but i don't know i still think 

407.42 410.60 A: that the good ones will probably stick around for a while and 

410.86 411.28 B: yeah 

411.63 413.84 A: stupid ones will (( )) i mean the stupid ones 

414.32 418.17 B: yeah (( )) they like play for a season and then are gone or something 

417.52 420.55 A: like who wants to marry a millionaire oh my goodness 

421.01 421.98 A: what was that 

422.13 424.24 B: yeah i i never saw that one either but 

424.35 432.71 B: you know there was so much press coverage (( events )) like yes (( reverting )) back to pre-nineteen fifties

431.64 433.00 A: (( dharma conger )) and 

433.34 436.51 A: oh my goodness that was just insane well and 

435.88 436.32 B: hm 

436.61 439.11 A: i think it they are kind of getting out of hand now because like 

439.51 439.86 A: they are 

440.63 444.61 A: you know like they wanted to have (( lizza minnelli )) reality t._v. show

467.26 471.09 B: i guess if you have enough money you are going to have your own t._v. show 

471.80 474.21 A: well i think that those shows are kind of like 

471.94 472.31 B: (( )) 

474.43 475.60 A: because of the osbournes 

476.28 479.27 B: yeah right which i have never seen either

513.16 522.26 B: like the real world or something (( that are )) sort of like you know everyday people living everyday type lives and like survivor where it is all exotic and sort of completely artificial like
