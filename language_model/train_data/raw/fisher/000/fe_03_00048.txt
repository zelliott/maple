50.01 50.47 A: right 

53.34 53.67 A: yeah 

53.64 55.11 B: but uh there is this sort of 

55.97 65.69 A: yeah (( well )) i guess th- they say they're um inexpensive it doesn't (( )) they don't have to pay actors and all that so it's a sh- she should have produced and as long as people are watching it 

59.65 60.22 B: (( )) 

61.04 62.00 B: that's right yeah 

65.40 65.81 B: right 

66.84 70.89 B: yeah i mean th- a lot of them sort of play off the tension of people 

71.12 71.53 B: uh 

72.22 73.80 B: backstabbing each other or somehow 

73.88 75.43 A: right 

74.32 74.80 B: uh 

75.36 76.92 B: interacting in 

77.23 78.55 B: ways that yeah 

80.37 81.16 A: yeah 

81.75 84.37 B: there's sort of loss (( for )) words (( )) interacting in ways that are sort of um 

84.97 88.72 B: yeah show the u- the unseemly underbelly of human 

89.08 90.88 B: behavior or something like that 

90.69 91.16 A: right 

91.65 92.12 B: yeah 

91.71 93.27 A: why do we enjoy watching it so much 

93.66 94.32 B: why do we 

94.39 96.34 A: yeah (( )) closer 

94.76 97.31 B: (( well )) do we no you and i i don't think we do 

97.51 97.93 B: uh 

99.85 103.32 B: i mean from what we said it seems like neither of us are so attracted to these things so 

103.08 103.48 A: right 

103.64 104.28 B: so uh 

104.57 107.11 B: we have to sort of hypothesize here uh 

106.61 106.89 A: right 

107.55 108.79 B: well what's what's your thought 

110.46 111.71 A: yeah i i don't know 

114.61 120.73 B: yeah actually i do watch something that again could be called sort of borderline reality show it really is not in the same uh 

121.68 124.52 B: genre really but have you ever heard of junk yard wars 

124.95 125.93 A: no what's that 

125.34 128.81 B: it goes under the name scrap heap challenge in britain it's from britain 

128.98 133.55 B: but uh it's on one of these um cable sort of educational channels the learning channel 

133.46 133.81 A: uh-huh 

134.16 134.96 B: and it's uh 

135.12 139.93 B: (( and it is )) a reality show in so far as you said it's no actors and it's probably very cheap to produce 

140.05 140.59 B: but um 

140.78 142.66 B: the uh premise is that 

143.40 145.38 B: they throw people in a junk yard 

145.52 156.77 B: so th- the people make teams so their usually mechanics or some people with mechanical background and they put them in a junk yard and they have some task to complete in ten hours like build a gun that shoots golf balls 

156.94 157.48 A: o._k. 

158.26 161.47 B: uh yeah so that's kind of fun and it's a reality show in the sense of 

162.27 162.99 B: it's uh 

163.11 170.39 B: you know it's really happening but it's not putting people together in a an apartment to watch them bicker or anything like that 

164.20 164.77 A: right 

169.95 170.41 A: right 

171.21 173.23 A: have you ever seen this show trading spaces 

173.56 174.68 A: i don't know 

173.64 174.90 B: yeah that's that's 

175.04 180.10 A: yeah i have an aunt who says she gets all her decorating ideas from watching that show i don't know 

179.55 185.29 B: i have seen that there's a couple different varieties like changing rooms or something too there's a couple different varieties but have you seen it 

183.29 185.07 A: oh o._k. 

185.58 190.84 A: uh yeah i've watched it you know i have a little sister who enjoys watching it also so whenever i'm home she wants me to watch it with her 

190.69 191.25 B: i see 

192.52 193.42 B: yeah it's uh 

193.66 199.18 B: it's a similar kind of thing it's not it's a reality show but not the the the nasty reality show it's sort of just or actually 

197.96 198.55 A: right 

199.30 201.17 B: sort of educational in the sense you're supposed to 

201.39 203.28 B: see how people would do something 

203.06 203.39 A: yeah 

204.95 207.66 B: there's a and in fact i think there's a similar one too where like 

208.33 212.95 B: it's a surprise like the spouse redecorates while the other spouse is away and 

213.24 213.82 A: oh wow 

214.31 217.15 A: (( )) that could like cause marital conflict 

216.92 217.90 B: i'm sorry i didn't hear you what 

217.65 226.01 A: i said it seems like that could be the cause of marital conflict when someone goes away and your husband or wife redecorates the whole house yeah 

220.60 221.33 B: yeah 

221.58 223.15 B: yeah i guess (( it could )) 

225.74 226.10 B: i think it 

226.22 229.76 B: could segue into that yeah that backstabbing bickering reality show but 

229.59 230.17 A: yeah 

229.92 231.44 B: i don't think that it usually does 

231.65 233.41 B: or maybe they don't show that if it does 

233.53 234.02 A: right 

235.20 235.63 B: yeah 

237.31 241.85 B: so there's sort of two questions there's um why do we watch them or why do people watch them and then 

243.70 244.18 B: uh 

245.87 248.50 B: well so we know that the the stations make them because they're cheap 

248.70 248.97 B: but 

248.84 249.26 A: right 

249.33 249.90 B: no one if 

250.08 254.16 B: no one watched them then they would not bother to make them no matter how cheap they were 

254.03 254.52 A: right 

254.45 256.35 B: so what's the appeal 

258.41 259.45 A: yeah i mean i guess 

259.91 261.97 A: because it's real life it's something people can 

262.53 264.93 A: imagine themselves being in more than you can 

265.16 267.45 A: putting yourself in a sitcom i don't know but you know 

267.23 267.96 B: yeah 

267.83 276.41 A: people watch survivor and we're all you know i- i (( )) lots of people who are considering applying to be on the next round of of applying to be on the next round of survivor themselves and 

272.55 273.68 B: mhm 

277.59 278.08 A: i don't know 

278.97 280.35 B: yeah i mean i guess it's like 

281.55 291.87 B: it's like cinema (( )) or something like that they actually people don't don't say their lines cleanly or anything they they sort of talk over each other and they interrupt and so it really has more of a 

292.45 293.47 B: reality uh 

293.90 296.70 B: flavor it's obviously real in a way that cinema and 

296.82 298.71 B: t._v. is obviously not 

298.93 301.64 B: and maybe that i mean that in itself maybe just has an appeal 

301.72 302.16 A: right 

302.51 304.57 B: but of course (( )) there's there's the whole sort of 

305.75 309.08 B: feeling that people are going to be having sex soon or something like that there's something that's 

309.23 316.26 B: very enticing that's going to happening any moment now though it may never actually get around to happening or you may never never see anything so there is that sort of 

313.43 313.77 A: yeah 

316.79 318.79 B: undercurrent aspect of them too 

319.67 320.16 A: mhm 

322.68 325.48 B: we're having trouble finding things to say about reality shows aren't we 

325.45 327.39 A: right um yeah now that we can't (( )) 

327.31 327.81 B: yeah 

330.46 330.73 A: hm 

332.60 333.17 B: um 

336.81 340.93 B: o._k. if you were going to make a reality show i'm really i'm really searching here but 

338.57 339.46 A: (( )) 

342.21 342.97 B: what would you do 

344.70 347.40 B: oh lo- ho- how about this one if you were going to be on a reality show 

347.87 348.28 B: which 

348.43 348.85 B: uh 

349.23 351.72 B: which type of reality show do you think you could swallow best 

353.01 356.67 A: i guess for being stuck in the wilderness (( )) kind of forced to 

356.93 358.64 A: um survive would be kind of 

359.12 360.13 A: would be kind of fun 

360.23 360.87 B: yeah 

360.74 361.25 A: i don't know 

362.65 371.68 A: yeah ew th- that definitely appeals to me more than the um what temptation island or even like fear factor or any of those no yeah the survivor 

368.44 368.88 B: right 

371.87 372.76 A: type um 

373.33 374.73 A: yeah concept says 

375.38 378.55 A: does seem like it would be interesting to actually t- be a part of 

378.53 379.02 B: yeah 

379.39 380.06 A: how about you 

380.13 385.07 B: i think yeah i mean some of those ones just i can't even watch like the bachelor or these marriage ones that are just 

384.25 384.95 A: right 

385.22 386.82 B: so embarrassing and so 

387.05 388.01 B: painful 

387.84 388.41 A: yeah 

388.19 397.96 B: and then and then getting stuck in a house i think could not work out well for me i think i i need some space so like you said these um these ones in the wilderness they're a bit scary but 

392.46 392.88 A: uh-huh 

398.07 400.65 B: yeah if i had to be on one i guess maybe that would be a 

409.50 410.19 A: o._k. right 

410.23 414.26 B: i don't know if they really count as reality shows under this definition uh 

414.78 418.84 B: yeah the wilderness what other kinds are there now so we've got sort of the wilderness variety right 

419.38 420.04 A: right 

419.86 422.38 B: what el- and the the stuck in the house the getting married 

422.49 423.17 A: right 

422.57 423.55 B: or something 

424.11 426.68 A: yeah (( )) there is that temptation island uh 

427.16 430.28 A: yeah a man and twenty women stuck on an island somewhere but 

429.62 431.85 B: oh o._k. i didn't even know what that was but 

430.42 431.40 A: yeah 

432.19 432.66 A: um 

432.97 438.35 A: yeah i don't (( just )) like fear factor count as a reality show the one where people are forced to swallow bugs and 

435.47 436.32 B: oh yeah 

437.84 440.58 B: i- i've never seen but i've seen commercials for it have you seen it 

440.06 442.46 A: uh-huh i've watched it once or twice yeah 

442.49 443.01 B: so 

443.17 444.36 B: how is it 

444.86 446.88 B: is it discus- is it just unwatchable or is it 

446.73 450.76 A: i mean it's basically not much more than what you see in the commercials it's just 

450.40 452.30 B: people nearly vomiting yeah 

450.91 454.65 A: people all take turns trying to swallow twenty bugs or trying to 

455.10 456.35 A: swim in blood or 

456.65 459.37 B: (( )) things that have actually very little to do with fear (( )) much more to (( )) 

456.82 457.27 A: yeah 

459.58 461.32 B: to do with nausea really like or 

460.78 464.69 A: right i mean (( i see if )) (( )) have to like walk across a tight rope between two buildings and 

464.78 465.41 B: o._k. that's 

465.19 465.73 A: things like that 

466.17 467.37 B: that's really like fear 

467.05 467.56 A: yeah 

468.59 473.29 B: yeah that actually no i don't if i could take i would just not do well on such a show probably 

472.85 473.79 A: right 

473.80 474.33 B: but uh 

474.61 480.38 B: yeah it's it's in principle there's an interesting kind of thing pushing people to their limits but i think it comes out being sort of 

481.07 482.32 B: just mostly nasty 

482.47 482.86 A: yeah 

482.68 486.22 B: like mostly uh things you really don't want to have to see 

485.34 485.83 A: right 

486.50 491.08 B: yeah so that's uh there's like those four or five different kinds are there any other kinds that we haven't thought of 

492.42 492.97 A: um 

492.82 493.98 B: there really are so many 

495.02 495.81 A: i don't think so 

498.26 501.57 A: i saw a simpson's episode the other night about reality shows where 

501.33 502.24 B: i saw that as 

501.84 505.40 A: (( )) eighteen century house and 

503.25 503.88 B: oh y- 

504.73 505.77 B: right 

507.13 507.53 A: yeah 

507.51 510.46 B: yeah there is that that other sort of (( )) get another like sub- 

510.64 517.14 B: part there the historical ones right so there have been a couple of those like the th- like you said there was a real eighteen century house one and 

513.03 513.57 A: right 

517.12 517.75 A: oh o._k. 

517.82 523.37 B: made in the u._k. a couple years ago as it's supposed to be more educational like learn how people lived back then 

523.34 523.73 A: uh-huh 

523.86 527.46 B: it wasn't supposed to pit people against each other particularly 

526.92 527.42 A: right 

527.58 528.16 B: but uh 

528.77 531.83 B: yeah and then there's going to be a couple more and then there was one that was like on a ship 

532.01 533.80 B: uh i don't know anything about that but that would be 

534.09 538.33 B: that would really interesting to me and that that would (( be one )) i would really like to be on like be on a 

535.41 535.88 A: uh-huh 

538.44 541.03 B: uh a nineteen century sailing ship 

540.95 541.36 A: yeah 

541.19 543.12 B: like an atlantic sailing ship 

543.79 546.09 B: and get scurvy and eat (( hard tac )) and 

546.08 546.65 A: uh-huh 

546.51 548.00 B: whatever else you do 

547.79 559.67 A: yeah i wonder if the appeal of the these re- reality shows is kind of the same as what appeals about um the game shows like who wants to be a millionaire things like that where just ordinary people are stuck on the show and have a chance to win something 

559.65 560.11 B: yeah 

560.37 563.50 B: there was a real like flood of those i think (( )) a real
