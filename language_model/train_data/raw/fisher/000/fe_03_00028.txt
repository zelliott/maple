31.35 32.56 B: yeah so 

34.25 38.09 A: colds and illness in the winter time 

37.29 43.31 B: um actually when i was back in china i do often get colds from time to time especially in winter 

43.39 54.48 B: and uh well i i kind of believe that if you don't take any medicine it does automatically you do automatically go back to the uh normal situation but actually since i came here 

45.36 48.27 A: (( mhm )) 

54.54 62.74 B: i have never caught a cold [mn] yeah i've been here for for more than a year but i have actually never caught a cold here so what about you

61.12 66.73 A: wow i i um i rarely get sick in the winter time i um [mn] 

66.39 67.92 B: really [laughter] 

67.03 69.36 A: (( yeah but i i think )) 

69.41 75.98 A: i don't know i mean s- i'll get sniffles and stuff in the fall sniffles and um sore throat but i i never 

72.71 73.78 B: mhm 

76.15 79.06 A: i it's been a long time since i've had a cold 

78.52 79.82 B: (( i see [laughter] )) 

79.15 80.93 A: and i think it's um 

81.12 84.08 A: i don't know good luck and diet [laughter] 

83.20 84.13 B: uh-huh 

84.15 91.11 B: and ac- actually i think the air here is pretty good so in china you've got [mn] pollution's very heavy and i guess a lot of bacteria 

84.25 85.03 A: um 

90.57 92.70 A: (( right )) 

91.12 101.29 B: in the air so that's why a lot of people do get uh flu from time to time and i went back to china actually last winter and it was such a bad epidemic there 

95.38 97.03 A: yeah 

101.36 109.04 B: and now i caught a really really bad cold and um but anyw- and especially i got a cold ju- just before i 

109.11 113.59 B: before i had to leave for the states and i stayed on on the plane 

110.92 112.03 A: mhm 

113.71 117.76 B: and it was like feeling really bad but after i came back here 

118.04 124.93 B: i don't recall that i took any medicine i just slept for a day and a half something like that well with the jet lag as well 

124.14 126.34 A: (( [noise] [mn] right well i i )) 

125.14 127.58 B: so well i i recovered [laughter] [mn] 

126.93 133.95 A: i think sleep is is really just one of the the best ways to get rid of any any sort of sickness 

132.70 138.35 B: yeah it seems to me too yeah you know you you just feel drowsy you don't feel like doing anything when you've got a cold yeah 

136.95 140.97 A: yeah i mean it's it's an excuse and it's it's also a cure [mn] for it 

140.46 141.72 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

141.73 150.43 B: but do you just you know do you actually do something regularly to just to keep healthy not not just say food but just to keep healthy 

149.86 154.89 A: um nothing actively you know i mean it's it's it's just a question of um 

154.95 157.90 A: for me i i i i drink a lot of water 

157.53 158.54 B: (( mhm )) 

157.96 158.96 A: and um 

159.07 163.40 A: people make fun of me because the they claim i'm over hydrated but 

162.60 163.68 B: [laughter] 

163.51 176.81 A: uh i i really like just the fact of drinking water you know a gallon a day or so and i i can't help but imagine that that has some sort of salubrious effect on you know the overall health 'cause 

176.97 183.35 A: you're you're flushing out all every every bad thing that gets into your body just flush it out [noise] 

181.29 184.22 B: oh yeah yeah i i agree actually 

184.44 191.64 B: and um yeah i drink water and i i'm taking i don't know whether people will call me a freak or not i take a vitamin 

191.68 196.72 B: something every i take a pill i t- i take a vitamin tablet every day 

192.38 194.31 A: (( [noise] right )) 

196.14 197.11 A: mhm 

196.85 198.13 B: and i 

198.30 199.34 B: i make it 

199.33 204.98 B: i make it a point to eat a lot of fruit and vegetables every day yeah i just feel that if you 

202.26 204.24 A: (( right )) 

204.96 215.33 B: get all your vitamins and stuff that may help to may help to enter the immune system well but that kind of proves again that that a kind of advertisement is everywhere so i tend to 

209.90 210.84 A: yeah 

215.43 221.48 B: believe that i say yeah just go with it it doesn't really have you have to like fruit and vegetables anyway 

220.95 229.63 A: right i i think just you know fresh fruit and the the least the less processed food that you eat the the better it is for your body and especially in the winter when 

229.75 231.77 A: you know th- there's not that much 

231.86 236.20 A: i mean around here you know it's it's harder to get fresh fruit and vegetables in the winter [noise] 

235.25 236.74 B: yeah yeah 

236.32 242.08 A: but um it it is you know an orange a day is a oranges and bananas are really good for you 

240.27 243.20 B: [mn] yeah i like oranges very much 

242.96 244.65 A: yeah 

243.71 248.39 B: do you do you do sports any kind of sports do you do that every week 

248.12 250.07 A: [noise] do i do what 

249.10 250.24 B: (( sports )) 

250.26 252.99 A: oh um i i used to um 

253.65 267.34 A: be more active in sports but it's nowadays it's just going to the um gym and lifting weights and riding riding the bike at the at the gym and um you know that that's good too to keep the circulation 

259.29 260.31 B: (( i see mhm mhm )) 

267.84 274.24 A: going you know circulatory system keep it active and healthy and the heart pumping and getting the blood through the body 

274.11 275.29 B: i see [noise] 

274.84 288.77 A: all this stuff i i just you know th- i feel that when you when i do these sorts of things without it's you know just preventative maintenance basically for the for my body and it it's really done a good job in terms of keeping me free from illness 

289.07 291.99 A: over the over time 

290.96 291.88 B: (( mhm uh-huh )) 

292.38 294.91 B: yeah i think there's a long term thing as well 

294.94 296.75 B: (( yeah uh as for me )) 

296.11 298.09 A: oh yeah very much so 

296.82 299.24 B: yeah yeah for me i 

299.36 307.40 B: i i guess i at least spend at least one afternoon on whatever either volleyball or tennis or table tennis or badminton 

306.86 308.12 A: right [sigh] 

307.55 311.53 B: i don't really like going to the gym that much because i think it's kind of boring 

310.88 323.15 A: well it it's it's really hard because i mean w- when you play sp- you know when you play a sport like football or baseball or something you're supposed to go to the gym to work out you understand the point of going to the gym but when you're just doing it for the [noise] 

311.74 312.61 B: yeah 

318.45 319.45 B: (( oh )) 

321.05 322.02 B: i see 

323.26 336.05 A: you know for some sort of long term health goal it's really hard to stay motivated for going to the gym when there's it's really going to the gym for the sake of going to the the gym you know and you're like oh this is making me stay healthy but 

327.64 328.73 B: uh-huh 

332.38 333.45 B: (( yeah )) 

336.05 341.24 A: you know in reality [noise] it's it's just the way to spend an hour [laughter] and um [noise] 

339.56 340.60 B: mhm 

341.45 343.36 A: i really wish that there was 

343.40 352.78 A: you know the i i really wish i could be more active in you know specific sports rather than just going to the the gym because it it's really hard to stay motivated to keep doing that 

351.69 356.34 B: yeah and if you play a ball game it's just you play with other people it's just 

355.74 361.35 A: right and it's more of a social thing yeah and that i mean you can't discount the 

356.36 358.98 B: more fun and it's easier yeah 

361.28 376.04 A: impact of just having good social relations on your health too it's- everything really impacts on you know how healthy you are just like how you interact with other people and the stuff you do for yourself just in the course of your day and um 

376.50 382.74 A: the social aspects of sport certainly cannot be overlooked in terms of what they do for your overall health [noise] 

381.58 382.42 B: (( [mn] uh-huh )) 

383.41 397.11 B: yeah but it's kind of surprising to me that uh i think especially from my experience i think i used to get a lot get a lot of various kinds of illness when i was in china because i think partly because of the air and because of my diet um habits but here 

397.31 399.17 B: i think the air here is so good 

398.81 400.76 A: mhm 

399.22 413.43 B: and um it seems to me that it's not really really easy to catch a cold anyway but you know sometimes when i go to the hospitals you will see well hospitals are always busy and doctors are always busy and you have to sometimes you can make an appointment you have to wait for 

402.38 402.96 A: (( [noise] )) 

412.13 415.06 A: (( yeah )) 

413.42 417.29 B: you know maybe you don't w- you won't get an appointment for the for the same day 

416.90 417.79 A: mhm 

417.65 420.38 B: so i don't know why there's still some people [mn] [lipsmack] 

421.80 422.85 B: uh 

423.78 429.80 B: [mn] i don't know but s- still there are people who are getting colds every day 

429.30 431.03 A: (( yeah )) 

430.05 438.28 B: and do you think that's just because their immune system's not working well and maybe sometimes you are when you are stressed out you are more likely to catch a cold 

438.34 439.56 B: (( or mhm )) 

438.93 444.62 A: i think that i mean there there's a lot of i mean the stress keeps the 

445.02 448.09 A: weakens the immune system and people um 

448.56 463.23 A: i think people are are too sedentary and um restrict themselves indoors and so when you spend all this time sitting around indoors with recirculated air without getting the fresh air um there's just all the germs floating around in the air and you don't get the chance to get out and get fresh air in your lungs 

462.98 463.98 B: yeah 

463.35 469.75 A: and then you're too stressed to do anything about it to treat yourself well so you you eat poorly you don't sleep as well 

469.79 478.11 A: and all th- all these things just sort of contribute to a general you know sort of feeling lousy you know [noise] and it's the sort of thing that if if you 

469.97 471.10 B: (( [mn] [noise] yeah )) 

475.94 477.00 B: that's right 

478.49 488.47 A: got fresh air and you know ate well and slept properly then that your you'd less likely end up in hospital you know seeing the doctor because you're sick 

486.19 487.12 B: yeah 

488.00 490.14 B: yeah i think so 

490.76 495.88 B: yeah [mn] but actually this is like the finals week um for us 

491.47 492.69 A: but 

495.43 497.01 A: oh god yeah 

495.91 499.94 B: so yeah we have the in ohio from time to time and uh 

498.97 500.93 A: mhm 

500.18 505.82 B: so yeah sometimes i feel really bad and i feel when i'm out there i feel i feel so low 

505.78 515.43 B: and i wonder at such times if i i don't i don't wear wear enough i may actually [mn] get something [laughter] 

514.10 524.55 A: yeah it's uh what the i always there there was a kid i knew from high school who'd always wear shorts and a tee shirt in the in the dead of winter and you'd 

522.33 523.36 B: oh yeah 

523.74 531.43 B: yeah yeah actually i saw a guy who j- who who was just wearing a tee shirt and it was like huh that's 

529.90 536.29 A: and i i don't know how they don't get sick he he was never sick and he he would never wear a jacket he would always you know 

536.19 550.02 A: walk betw- walk around town in the middle of winter in shorts and a tee shirt and you just sort of wonder how and it it wasn't like he was you know fat with this huge insul- layer of insulating fat he was just a skinny kid and he n- i never saw him get sick 

546.32 547.57 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

550.11 553.80 B: i i think it's something genetic maybe 

553.61 555.47 A: yeah 

553.94 557.03 B: somehow they're just not sensitive to cold air 

556.49 557.66 A: (( [mn] )) 

557.52 565.13 B: or maybe there is some kind of heating system you know body element yeah i actually have a class mate and he he's an american student and he 

565.20 568.72 B: he always wears socks and uh sandals 

567.42 568.26 A: (( [mn] )) 

568.90 570.15 A: (( okay )) 

569.73 578.49 B: no matter what and sometimes if if it gets really cold then he will wear a a pair of jeans otherwise he just goes with those shorts 

570.86 572.60 A: right 

575.86 577.57 A: mhm 

578.04 579.17 A: wow 

578.56 584.34 B: and now well i guess these days it's really cold so he's wearing something long 

584.29 586.21 A: [laughter] 

584.36 593.69 B: and but he is just one typical guy and i was talking to my friends i would say i when it started snowing the other day i was saying 

593.57 603.57 B: i really want to see what he's wearing today [laughter] well he was wearing wearing jeans and a t- a long shirt that day but yeah he didn't wear a sweater or whatever 

596.01 597.39 A: (( yeah )) 

601.18 602.44 A: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

603.40 605.22 A: that's a little better but 

604.70 607.71 B: yeah and he's really fit 

607.96 614.18 B: you know so i don't really think that's related to whether you have a lot of fat in your body to burn or what but it's just 

612.31 613.83 A: no [laughter] 

614.21 619.02 B: i that's a miracle they just have something i guess it's something genetic you know yeah 

618.36 621.67 A: yeah i mean some people have got it and some people don't and uh 

620.12 622.48 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

621.68 628.64 A: i don't know if they're lucky or what because i don't mind wearing a j- i'd i'd feel weird just not wearing a 

628.54 631.65 B: yeah and you know the uh seasonal changes are kind of 

631.72 640.51 B: there has to be some for us so if you feel that and i spent two years in singapore where you you you you only have to wear shorts and tee shirt all year round 

633.64 635.56 A: right 

639.85 644.64 A: right 'cause it's always eighty eighty degrees [mn] and humid yeah 

641.77 642.87 B: you feel it's kind of 

642.91 651.06 B: like kind of monotonous and boring you know you you want to experience the cold air and you want to be in the cold air for some time so 

645.14 646.99 A: right 

651.20 654.98 B: i guess yeah maybe it's hard to say whether they like it or not but maybe 

655.02 658.90 B: they they will also be less likely to catch cold i guess [mn] 

657.71 665.38 A: yeah because the they're you know not treating themselves right and not doing what they're supposed to do to adjust to the seasons [laughter] 

660.77 664.23 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

664.76 669.66 B: [laughter] so have you been travelling around 

669.03 673.63 A: actually i'm leaving for jamaica in um a day and a half
