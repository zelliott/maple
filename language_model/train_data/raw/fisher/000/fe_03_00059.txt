59.07 60.52 A: you know someone could be 

61.10 61.63 A: ah 

61.74 67.26 A: i mean i don't don't smoke and don't like it when people do in my presence but i can sort of see how 

68.19 71.24 A: people can feel good while doing it at least 

71.13 71.93 B: right that's true 

71.43 71.82 A: um 

72.77 77.23 A: but um but i i haven't really thought of of abusive alcohol that's different i mean 

77.64 78.96 A: i see nothing wrong with eh 

79.27 82.13 A: you know not abusing alcohol you know just drinking some 

82.06 82.57 B: yeah that's 

82.37 84.32 A: but that's really different from ruining 

84.83 86.26 A: oneself and other people yeah 

84.86 85.21 B: yeah 

86.17 89.11 B: i just thought they said over consumption of alcohol 

89.38 89.86 A: yeah 

89.66 94.07 B: eh eh and i mean if you're talking about over consumption i would say that it would be 

94.95 96.26 B: um to me anyway 

96.73 97.08 A: don't 

96.77 98.08 B: but i agree i'd have i would have 

98.19 101.52 B: see it's my second would probably be not exercising because i agree that 

104.76 105.94 A: yeah 

105.18 106.05 B: get out 

106.14 107.52 A: definitely 

107.43 107.85 B: yes 

108.20 110.08 A: yeah 

110.25 110.86 B: so eh 

110.44 111.07 A: um 

111.85 114.07 B: i don't know what else we're supposed to talk about then 

113.95 117.59 A: eh i don't know so how often do we exercise eh 

117.96 120.03 A: not very often i was going to go today 

120.13 121.75 A: actually i went to yoga this morning 

121.85 122.53 B: oh wow 

122.04 122.76 A: so that counts 

122.89 123.73 A: yeah 

123.25 124.54 B: what yeah that definitely counts 

123.99 124.40 A: um 

124.94 125.36 A: yeah 

126.03 129.99 A: i don't know but it sort of feels like it barely counts because i got myself there 

130.26 130.81 A: and 

130.98 137.50 A: i did my thing and then collapsed on the couch it doesn't feel right 

133.96 134.94 B: oh yes 

136.38 137.29 B: that is true 

137.79 139.29 A: yeah 

138.90 140.98 B: oh i would say that i walk daily 

141.50 142.00 A: aha 

141.85 143.71 B: i like to go on walks you know fifteen 

143.93 145.32 B: twenty minutes or what not 

145.88 147.14 A: yeah good for you yeah 

146.81 148.14 B: if it's too cold though 

148.53 148.92 A: right 

149.04 149.48 A: yeah 

149.69 150.82 A: yeah it's getting really cold 

150.84 151.77 B: yes definitely 

152.20 152.63 A: yeah 

153.59 156.20 B: right i would say instead yeah it's normal exercise 

158.73 159.20 A: yeah 

159.14 160.40 B: i don't go to the gym 

159.35 160.09 A: yeah i used to live 

161.15 163.89 A: yeah i 

164.04 164.57 A: but 

164.91 170.41 A: um b- i used to be in a place where i could just go hiking all the time that was great that was wonderful 

170.44 171.19 B: that would be nice 

171.66 172.10 A: yeah 

173.02 177.74 A: oh and the stair master isn't it's just not the same thing 

177.09 179.39 B: and i think you need the fresh air maybe 

178.88 182.03 A: yeah yeah fresh air and something to look at 

181.66 182.29 B: definitely 

182.85 183.24 A: yeah 

183.93 184.75 A: besides 

184.89 187.04 A: people who look like hamsters 

187.34 187.94 A: yeah 

187.85 188.94 B: that is true 

188.86 192.09 A: and feeling like a hamster too 

191.57 193.59 B: yeah it's exactly just kind of same little 

192.33 192.66 A: (( but )) 

193.84 195.31 B: (( spot )) running around 

195.01 195.94 A: yeah 

197.60 198.96 B: so you don't smoke then either 

199.39 200.80 A: i don't smoke yeah 

201.28 202.06 A: you don't either 

202.05 203.07 B: no definitely not 

202.70 203.63 A: yeah 

203.98 205.65 B: i think that maybe goes along with um 

206.34 207.79 B: liking exercise 

208.14 209.33 A: yeah that's 

209.15 211.99 B: because i think it's kind of hard to exercise if you smoke a lot 

209.51 210.33 A: i that's true 

212.15 213.54 A: yeah that's that's so true 

213.85 214.19 B: so 

214.29 216.62 B: they kind of go hand in hand i guess a lot of those things 

217.22 218.27 A: i think they do yeah 

218.81 221.67 A: i have a nephew who smokes a lot he's only 

221.92 226.63 A: like i mean i saw him when he was sixteen and he was chain smoking i was just shocked 

226.49 227.19 B: oh my goodness 

226.75 227.16 A: and 

227.64 230.16 A: yeah and like i couldn't my brother for 

230.48 231.21 A: you know not 

231.83 233.92 A: uh not doing something about that because he 

234.05 234.91 A: he could've 

235.03 235.63 B: right 

235.23 240.94 A: uh like um especially my brother could have stopped smoking himself that would've i think made a big difference 

239.10 239.93 B: oh 

241.10 241.74 A: but 

242.73 245.68 A: but my nephew was worse than my brother that 

246.17 246.71 A: and 

247.02 248.16 B: wow at sixteen 

247.08 247.92 A: uh 

248.79 249.81 A: yeah and 

249.99 250.87 A: i i just 

251.68 254.22 A: uh i hate to think what's going to happen and 

254.40 255.81 A: uh 

256.44 256.91 A: it's 

257.22 258.37 A: yeah it's very bad 

258.52 259.34 B: yeah especially 

258.85 259.63 A: and he doesn't (( leave )) 

259.74 260.13 A: yeah 

260.17 261.59 B: yeah at a young age like that i mean 

262.25 265.17 B: if you start then when ar- when do you stop you know 

262.35 262.78 A: yeah 

264.61 265.36 A: exactly 

265.57 267.56 A: it's going to be so hard to stop that 

267.70 268.21 B: right 

269.07 269.65 A: um 

270.05 270.52 A: yeah 

270.95 272.40 A: but he sees my brother and of course 

272.96 278.84 A: as far as my nephew is concerned his dad is infinitely old so why does he care so 

277.01 278.46 B: ah i (( )) 

279.21 280.24 B: that is true 

280.28 281.29 A: yeah 

283.20 287.01 B: uh luckily for me i don't really know anyone in my immediate family that smokes and 

283.25 283.79 A: mhm 

287.08 287.48 A: uh-huh 

287.59 290.59 B: and they're i actually have a very health conscious family 

290.72 292.14 B: a lot of exercising and 

293.13 293.66 A: that's good 

293.88 296.88 B: my grandfather's like eigh- eighty four years old and he 

296.98 298.28 B: goes to the gym everyday 

298.55 299.18 A: oh wow 

299.16 300.16 B: it's unbelievable 

300.49 302.19 A: that's really impressive yeah 

302.40 303.66 B: yeah so i don't know 

303.85 304.99 B: and he lifts weights and 

305.50 306.28 B: watches what he eats 

307.29 307.93 A: oh 

309.93 310.95 A: yeah good for him 

310.98 313.85 B: i know it's amazing i can only hope to be that lucky 

313.99 315.80 A: yeah that's that's (( what age )) 

315.92 318.50 A: makes you you know not afraid of getting old 

318.13 319.11 B: right definitely 

319.44 319.70 A: that's 

319.88 320.53 A: that's great 

321.35 323.30 A: yeah is your grandmother still alive 

323.30 324.19 B: um yes she is 

324.90 329.45 B: but she's she's not so much into the exercising i guess she's more of a a reading 

325.57 326.02 A: that's good 

329.88 331.07 B: sit at home kind of person 

331.37 332.01 A: oh okay 

332.08 333.82 B: she loves to read all the time 

332.29 332.65 A: yeah 

333.87 334.20 A: mm 

334.57 335.63 A: that's good too 

336.88 339.91 A: i guess we could talk about that like what are the best topics 

340.60 341.23 B: that's true 

341.69 342.19 A: oh and 

343.43 343.88 A: yeah 

344.25 346.30 A: so reading is good exercising is good 

347.91 349.22 A: talking with people is good 

349.22 349.80 B: mhm 

349.82 352.44 A: i don't know if this counts but 

351.17 353.58 B: i don't know it's interesting it's an interesting idea 

353.62 354.59 A: yeah 

355.81 356.46 A: um 

357.72 359.25 A: yeah let's see so 

359.74 361.74 A: but we didn't talk about all the bad habits yet 

361.77 362.37 B: no 

362.49 363.79 B: like what were (( )) oh 

362.75 363.22 A: uh 

364.02 366.19 B: overconsumption of caffeine i think as well 

366.68 367.96 A: oh right caffeine 

368.06 369.10 A: yeah that's 

369.65 370.87 A: that's kind of bad too isn't it 

370.92 371.72 B: i think so 

372.05 372.46 A: yeah 

372.47 374.21 B: i think especially if it makes people 

374.42 375.49 B: nervous or 

376.15 380.36 B: um hyper active i don't know if you know anybody who if you drink excessive caffeine you get really 

380.87 382.20 B: kind of up tight or 

382.99 383.48 B: um 

383.10 383.74 A: yeah 

384.18 385.18 B: jittery maybe 

386.19 389.67 A: definitely there was a time when i dr- just drank too much coffee and 

389.91 390.89 A: i was always 

390.99 392.16 A: really hyper and 

392.44 392.89 B: mhm 

392.94 394.35 A: i didn't feel good at all 

394.16 394.59 B: mhm 

394.82 398.17 A: um now i'm drinking much less it's like one cup in the morning and that's it 

398.17 398.92 B: oh that's good 

400.03 405.78 B: yeah i don't drink much caffeine at all i mean maybe a soda a a week or something like that but 

405.89 406.35 A: uh-huh 

406.61 410.41 B: most likely no i jus- i don't like that feeling of being agitated 

410.78 411.22 A: yeah 

411.12 411.64 B: you know 

412.48 412.87 B: so 

413.71 415.71 B: and plus i don't really appreciate the uh 

416.00 418.80 B: carbonation that goes along with a lot of caffeinated drinks and 

418.75 419.59 A: that's true yeah 

422.15 423.08 A: yeah that's (( fun )) 

422.93 423.86 B: but i don't think that that's 

424.07 425.02 B: too bad of 

425.19 427.48 B: a habit i guess if it's the worst habit you have it's 

428.21 429.11 B: not too bad 

429.27 430.22 A: i agree yeah 

430.84 432.56 A: yeah definitely it could it can get worse 

432.73 433.71 A: and and also 

434.13 435.87 A: it's just bad for the person 

436.01 437.35 A: who is doing it and 

437.47 438.78 A: like some of the others are 

439.49 440.29 A: i mean things like 

440.60 441.25 A: smoking 

441.44 441.99 B: right 

442.14 443.95 A: affects the the other people as well 

443.95 445.01 B: mhm that's true 

444.73 445.02 A: yeah 

446.12 446.71 A: but it's 

447.30 447.74 A: yeah i'd like 

447.87 449.45 A: to stop drinking the stuff all together 

449.99 453.04 A: than not not (( )) 

451.99 452.36 B: mhm 

453.76 454.72 A: what about overeating 

455.22 456.59 A: do you know anyone who does that 

456.56 458.28 B: not not really no 

458.81 460.67 B: but i can imagine that would be pretty bad 

458.83 459.74 A: hm 

461.17 462.85 A: yeah i think that'd be terrible yeah 

461.55 461.95 B: i mean 

462.90 463.82 B: especially if you don't 

464.02 466.61 B: exercise because then you'd probably gain a lot of weight 

467.18 467.66 A: yeah 

467.59 468.81 B: that's pretty unhealthy 

469.54 470.34 A: yeah that is bad 

470.62 475.76 A: and it's so sad when people can't help it because i think there are a lot of people who who just can't help it and 

475.16 475.74 B: mhm 

476.09 477.65 A: it's it's a disease and it's 

477.89 478.33 A: just 

478.75 479.99 A: just awful 

479.48 479.98 B: mhm 

480.76 481.57 B: yes i agree 

481.97 487.74 A: yeah but i don't know anyone like my family they're all very skinny they have the opposite problem if anything 

485.05 485.52 B: mhm 

485.77 486.23 B: well that's 

487.51 489.69 B: ah no that's lucky at least i guess 

489.87 490.74 A: yeah no it is good 

491.17 494.03 A: that'd be much preferred that way but still yeah 

494.29 495.82 B: ah i can't imagine that i mean 

496.02 496.90 B: and i think that 

497.00 497.89 B: culture kind of 

498.49 501.49 B: um you go out to eat and the proportions are so huge 

501.69 502.79 A: i know yeah 

502.61 505.50 B: that i mean i mea- i at least for myself i always take 

505.81 507.06 B: home leftovers 

507.31 508.26 A: right yeah 

507.76 508.07 B: you know 

508.17 512.36 B: you know and there are some people that can sit and eat the entire thing and then order desert or 

512.60 513.17 B: whatnot 

512.82 513.52 A: that's right 

514.25 517.33 A: and this happened to me that i just kind of i ordered the thing and 

517.51 520.97 A: you know i was brought up to eat what was on my plate and so i do 

520.76 521.19 B: mhm 

521.35 521.90 A: and 

522.12 524.53 A: completely unthinkingly so i just the whole thing 

524.88 528.46 A: and i and then i realize that it was much more than i wanted and 

528.04 529.20 B: oh yeah 

528.69 533.92 A: and certainly more than i needed and yeah um 

530.05 531.54 B: and you feel so full 

534.05 534.68 A: so 

535.35 537.54 A: luckily it d- d- doesn't happen very often i just 

537.65 538.56 A: don't go out that much 

538.65 539.04 B: right 

538.67 539.23 A: but 

539.91 541.90 A: but you're right the portions are so huge 

541.85 542.38 B: mhm 

543.00 545.08 A: why do think that is why do they make them that big 

544.94 551.37 B: i don't know i mean i don't know if you travel a lot but i- if you ever go to other countries it doesn't seem like when you go out to eat that they 

551.93 553.39 B: give you half that much 

553.48 555.43 A: that's right yeah yeah i've noticed that too 

555.55 558.25 B: like especially in europe you get very small portions and 

555.74 556.15 A: yeah 

558.33 559.09 A: that's right 

558.92 561.49 B: it's more like the quality versus the quantity i think 

561.98 564.19 A: yeah there going to restaurants just means that 

564.29 565.05 A: the food is 

565.39 568.09 A: you know it's it's fancier than what you'd make at home and
