1.25 1.68 B: hello 

1.81 2.35 A: hi 

2.81 3.35 B: hi 

3.50 4.44 A: my name's ellen 

4.65 5.45 B: i'm beth 

5.40 5.92 A: hi 

7.13 9.15 A: do you watch reality t._v. 

8.31 10.15 B: actually i don't 

10.31 12.76 A: oh you don't oh shoot 

11.16 13.20 B: i use to watch survivor a lot 

13.31 15.15 A: i did well i watched 

15.36 17.80 A: where was the first survivor i think it was 

18.03 20.32 A: um i want to say africa but i think that was 

20.46 21.95 A: more of a later one 

21.01 23.65 B: that was yeah that was the second one i think 

23.19 24.54 A: okay the first one 

24.69 26.65 B: i don't remember where the first one was 

25.62 26.80 A: australia maybe 

27.41 28.68 B: no that was the third one 

28.46 31.76 A: oh no it was like summer of two thousand 

32.28 32.90 A: um 

32.98 34.25 B: but i don't remember where it was 

34.23 35.10 A: and i know this 

34.51 38.19 B: i just remember i use to watch it and i stopped watching it because i didn't like watching them eat bugs 

38.52 43.51 A: oh i know yeah well that reminds me of the show fear factor 

43.71 44.81 A: do you watch that at all 

44.99 46.86 B: um i started watching it 

45.49 46.40 A: probably not if 

46.94 48.54 B: but i found it a little bias 

49.64 56.69 B: because there was a vegetarian on and one of the dares she had to do was eat uh worms but she's vegetarian 

54.11 54.54 A: oh 

55.11 55.57 A: oh 

56.98 61.22 B: it's not that she's afraid to do it is just that she wouldn't do it because it went against her morals 

60.95 62.12 A: oh 

61.96 63.57 B: and that didn't seem fair to me at all 

63.78 65.12 A: are you a vegetarian too 

65.19 65.88 B: no but 

66.31 67.23 B: i'm i'm i'm 

66.34 66.79 A: (( )) 

67.61 68.76 B: pro-morals you know like 

68.52 69.49 A: sure sure 

70.55 72.14 A: i didn't see that one i 

72.41 77.48 A: i kind a got turned off like you said you did when the survivor people had to eat bugs but 

77.90 79.81 A: i was i liked the fear factor 

79.94 89.25 A: show and the aspect of the daring things they have to do like getting on a airplane and walking down the wing and getting the flag and coming back and 

83.03 83.85 B: mhm 

89.09 90.62 B: yeah at least there 

89.44 93.57 A: certain like those things and riding a bike from building to building you know 

93.44 93.78 B: yeah 

93.78 95.20 A: nine stories high or how ever 

94.58 95.90 B: i don't like the bug things 

95.44 98.97 A: yeah the eating things is is kind a gross but 

99.58 100.14 A: but uh 

100.36 105.68 A: yeah there some aspects of reality t._v. that are intriguing but my husband and i talk about how 

100.38 101.37 B: have you ever (( )) 

102.57 102.96 B: yeah 

106.32 110.61 A: there's al- like in survivor there's always a role a type cast you know there's 

110.24 110.69 B: uh-huh 

111.02 118.30 A: the old guy there's a seeming gay woman there's the incredibly perfect looking woman and 

118.70 123.93 A: a guy you know there's just different roles that your like oh okay there's jerry there's susan you know and 

119.14 121.37 B: uh-huh 

123.55 124.01 B: yeah 

124.05 125.03 A: you can remember 

125.20 126.54 A: you know just matching them up 

126.53 127.92 B: and they should just change it 

128.10 129.03 B: every time 

129.61 130.95 A: and i guess they change it 

129.68 131.87 B: they should have one that's men against woman or something 

132.28 133.80 A: well that'd be interesting 

133.58 135.51 B: yeah 

134.45 135.71 A: that be kind of hard though 

136.68 137.71 B: not really if they 

136.76 137.76 A: that's a good idea 

137.88 141.08 B: if they make it evenly so there's a couple old guys and 

140.89 141.60 A: right 

141.74 145.11 B: you know that are you know pick the (( week ends )) 

145.30 146.46 B: the good guys and the 

145.97 146.58 A: sure 

147.55 149.35 B: strong women and week women you know 

149.37 149.97 A: yeah 

150.03 151.66 B: make them evenly matched 

152.12 153.52 A: it is kind of cool because 

153.65 160.97 A: the people start showing their true colors because there kind of starved and they're just so removed from what they're use to 

160.72 162.81 B: yeah they try to have all these 

161.19 164.43 A: you know that probably men verses women could work 

164.75 165.30 B: probably 

165.43 166.02 A: yeah 

167.05 168.21 A: what else is out there 

168.45 170.25 B: uh big brother 

170.14 171.29 A: oh 

171.29 171.99 B: ever seen that 

172.76 179.03 A: i watched it the first summer it came out i wasn't too into that though that seemed 

179.98 181.00 A: fake to me 

181.44 183.71 B: i liked it especially when they brought in the dog 

182.21 182.92 A: oh did you 

183.89 185.99 A: i guess i didn't see it enough to 

186.16 190.49 B: well i didn't see very many episodes i have kids so it's hard for me to watch to much t._v. but 

190.08 190.72 A: oh 

190.96 195.99 B: i saw an episode and they were all happy about bringing in this new player 

195.78 197.50 A: oh and it was a dog 

196.30 199.06 B: new member of the family and it was a dog 

198.67 201.63 A: oh that's funny i i didn't see that one 

201.41 206.51 B: and they were all ecstatic about having the dog but then they all had fight over who would eat the dog or them 

206.25 207.05 A: oh gross 

207.78 208.09 A: uh 

207.86 209.76 B: well no not eating the dog 

209.38 210.17 A: oh who would what 

210.38 211.49 B: would eat 

211.88 213.85 A: oh oh oh 

212.56 215.50 B: like would they'd feed the dog or would they eat the dog food 

215.18 218.51 A: oh how did they resolve it 

218.81 221.33 B: i don't remember i didn't watch that much afterwards 

219.60 220.08 A: oh 

220.81 222.38 A: yeah i never watched that one 

223.30 224.19 A: and what about mm 

223.45 226.01 B: because they had some food problems in that one 

225.87 226.54 A: oh 

226.25 230.22 B: there not aloud to leave so if they run out of food or some one eats to much food then they're in trouble 

230.09 230.84 A: oh 

231.36 231.64 A: um 

232.53 235.41 A: did ever watch real world because i think that's the original 

235.53 236.62 A: reality t._v. 

235.91 237.71 B: i don't think i've ever even heard of that one 

237.88 241.79 A: that's on m._t._v. and i think m._t._v. was way ahead of fox 

241.36 242.96 B: i don't get m._t._v. 

242.65 243.87 A: oh where do you live 

243.82 245.05 B: i'm in canada 

244.88 245.95 A: oh okay 

246.52 247.09 A: um 

247.69 251.46 A: well m._t._v. is you know music television and they have this show 

249.87 250.44 B: yeah 

251.56 252.46 A: called real world 

253.27 256.42 A: and it's been going i'm not sure maybe ten years 

256.41 257.31 B: it's still going 

256.52 256.78 A: and it 

257.65 258.27 A: yeah 

258.35 258.88 B: wow 

258.76 260.83 A: yeah and i really do think that they were 

261.06 262.72 A: you know the wayward thinkers 

261.90 264.38 B: they're probably the best at it because they've been doing it so long 

264.56 265.49 A: yeah yeah 

265.98 270.77 A: it's always like a young group of kids and they apply and who ever get on gets to go to this 

280.45 283.60 A: they always get these really posh places to live and they're always 

292.54 297.10 A: people together who didn't know each other at first then surviving through the summer together and 

297.29 298.36 A: you know inevitably 

298.94 299.84 A: bull hooks up 

299.93 301.08 A: then inevitably 

301.65 304.56 A: you know a couple of girls might fight it out and battle it out and 

304.75 305.69 A: and so on 

305.99 307.91 B: there's another one temptation island 

307.77 309.91 A: i never watched that one did you 

309.60 314.16 B: i didn't i watched a few times it was amusing but i didn't like it all that much because 

313.46 318.24 A: well i would think if your like the moral take the moral stand point then you would just kind of be like 

318.44 319.61 A: appalled by that one 

319.88 325.62 B: actually i was thinking of getting some guy who wasn't my boyfriend and calling them up and saying come on let us go 

325.86 328.97 B: that would just be fun you know we'd both get a little 

329.20 332.43 B: something if the other person was into and 

331.29 332.17 A: yeah i guess 

333.08 337.61 A: that one i never watched that one because it was a little weird to me there all a little weird 

338.09 341.15 A: it's just amazing that reality t._v. has gone as far as it is 

341.37 342.40 B: yeah 

341.90 342.40 A: and 

342.62 343.48 A: i think now that 

344.17 346.72 A: that call it reality t._v. i really don't think it truly is 

346.99 348.69 A: real t._v. cause it's not 

352.61 354.64 B: my sisters son is upstairs 

354.47 355.16 A: oh 

355.86 356.85 B: he's supposed to be sleeping 

356.99 357.64 A: oh 

358.67 359.11 A: um 

359.94 361.90 A: are you in the same time zone as the east coast 

362.10 363.33 B: yes 

362.69 363.12 A: yeah 

363.53 364.03 B: i think so 

364.71 365.45 B: no wait 

365.02 365.51 A: it's uh 

365.84 366.61 A: eight twenty 

367.50 369.92 B: oh it's eight fifteen by my clock but yes 

369.30 372.82 A: well yeah same 

372.56 374.54 B: five minutes difference isn't that much 

374.28 375.55 A: right right 

376.49 378.56 A: so what other shows are out there in reality 

377.80 378.39 B: um 

378.55 383.07 B: there's one i'm not sure if it's considered reality t._v. but there's the dating game shows 

384.27 387.16 A: oh i haven't seen those maybe there not here in the states 

387.50 390.25 B: i don't know we have a couple of them up here and it's basically 

390.95 392.05 B: they have one where 

392.60 395.38 B: this guy and this girl they're set up together by their 

395.61 397.02 B: like and preference 

396.93 397.55 A: oh 

397.65 399.61 B: and then they have little pop up captions 

399.82 400.61 A: oh really 

400.53 402.09 B: through out the uh date 

402.43 402.92 B: date 

403.49 405.34 A: i haven't i don't think that's on here 

406.48 407.35 A: do you enjoy that one 

407.68 408.37 B: uh i 

408.60 411.89 B: i watch it for the captions because the captions are like um 

412.48 420.20 B: a couple would be talking about something and the guy would be nodding his head as if he's loosing interest and the caption would come up like he's thinking about something different 

420.04 420.91 A: right right 

421.99 422.91 A: that would be funny 

423.20 424.22 B: yeah it was funny 

424.49 425.40 A: i haven't seen that 

424.90 429.61 B: they don't really have a lot of couples that actually date after the first one i think they're just in it for the t._v. 

429.84 430.51 A: no 

430.62 434.17 B: let's be on t._v. and join the show and never actually stay with the person they actually pick 

433.84 438.84 A: right right that's like um millionaire do you get that one or the bachelor i guess 

439.51 440.52 A: do you get the bachelor 

439.61 440.47 B: the bachelor 

441.24 442.41 A: that's um where 

442.64 447.36 A: he supposedly a millionaire and he has his choice of ten women or so 

444.62 445.66 B: yeah 

446.53 448.06 B: that's over though 

448.33 448.95 A: yeah 

449.23 454.50 B: the uh huh i it was all over the papers they get married and then they broke up with in like a week 

454.62 455.41 A: oh they did 

455.34 458.35 B: yes and she got half of his money because they were married 

458.44 459.45 A: you're kidding 

459.24 460.76 B: or something i'm not sure if 

461.11 463.71 B: i don't remember but i remember she did get some money 

463.97 466.65 A: no i didn't hear that they had already broken up i did hear 

465.98 467.28 B: they broke up within a week 

467.71 468.31 A: i knew that 

468.46 473.20 A: he actually did propose cause i don't know how many millionaire have been out 

473.39 475.04 A: but the very first one 

475.37 477.35 A: he seemed like kind of a dog cause he 

477.54 484.49 A: made his final selection and he lives i think in california and the girl he chose lived in kansas or somewhere 

485.08 490.63 A: he made he put like a contingency in the deal i'll marry you if you come to california 

490.63 491.03 B: yeah 

491.50 492.10 A: but um 

491.84 493.03 B: that's the one that broke up 

493.41 497.12 B: the original one they got married they we're married for a week and then they got divorced 

494.66 495.39 A: oh 

495.64 496.53 A: oh they did 

497.21 498.86 A: oh okay i didn't know that 

498.71 503.46 B: it was all over the news and how it was a fraud because they were divorced now and all this 

503.34 505.47 A: oh wow but she got his money uh 

505.74 507.38 B: some of it a least not half but 

507.68 510.37 B: i'm sure there was a pre nup but she still got some money just for being in it 

510.74 511.14 A: uh 

511.74 513.67 A: now there was another one recently 

514.08 516.25 A: and he really did propose 

516.76 517.78 A: on the last show 

519.11 520.81 A: so i don't know how that ones going 

522.27 524.10 A: but what was i going to say there was 

525.99 526.85 A: bachelor 

527.32 529.55 A: oh i saw something on um 

530.74 532.96 A: like e._t. do you get entertainment television 

533.11 533.81 B: uh 

533.14 534.00 A: the e channel 

534.22 535.97 B: i think we get a version of it 

535.88 538.62 A: they were interviewing the producer 

538.73 540.33 A: of the millionaire 

552.11 556.59 A: presents himself as a millionaire and goes through the whole role that 

556.72 560.22 A: the girls through and it turns out he's just some average joe 

560.60 561.96 A: and he's not a millionaire 

562.11 568.49 A: and on the last night you know he makes his final selection and he tells the woman you know i'm not a millionaire after all 

568.83 570.13 A: will you still marry me 

570.38 570.92 A: and 

570.40 571.66 B: i'd like to know if she dumps him 

571.74 575.07 A: yeah well and we don't know we just know that the story line 

575.38 580.31 A: so i'm thinking fox is pretty together cause that would probably get people to watch 

580.73 581.15 B: yeah 

581.19 581.61 A: you know 

583.82 589.07 A: we'll i think i've exhausted my reality t._v. conversation i don't know what other shows are out there 

587.51 588.29 B: um 

589.79 592.96 A: um there certainly are a lot of reality t._v. shows 

592.68 593.10 B: what about 

593.35 595.24 B: uh oh well no there really game shows 

595.82 597.37 A: yeah your right they are 

602.50 603.20 A: yeah 

603.79 607.02 A: yeah i guess you could kind of call that reality but not ass much 

608.16 609.25 A: what else is there 

614.31 616.87 A: i didn't watch any of the survivor in thailand 

614.47 615.41 B: i have no idea 

617.59 620.64 A: but with survivor i hear they make it more difficult each 

617.79 618.55 B: survivor 

621.10 622.00 A: each time 

622.13 622.68 B: do they 

622.19 624.79 A: like they either starve them more 

625.09 625.44 A: they just 

625.70 627.42 B: yeah cause they want to keep the viewers 

627.32 632.79 A: yeah they they ad some twist to it where it make it even more challenging to win the million dollars 

634.05 634.45 A: oh 

635.47 639.47 B: i remember one that sounded a lot like the one you said was on m._t._v. 

639.72 640.69 A: oh the real world 

640.88 641.65 B: yeah it was 

642.15 644.21 B: it had a bunch of four kids 

644.29 645.63 A: yeah like college kids 

645.77 647.21 B: yeah and they were all in like 

647.52 651.95 B: japan or something and they had to come up with money to pay for rent for an apartment 

651.95 652.72 A: oh wow 

653.31 655.56 B: an they all had the money but 

655.83 662.34 B: they had so much trouble getting it because of bank accounts and stuff that wouldn't except it and stuff that they almost lost the apartment 

658.96 659.78 A: oh really 

662.15 663.02 A: oh wow 

663.24 664.50 A: no i didn't see that one 

664.06 665.69 B: and they all had to go home again 

665.70 666.48 A: oh 

667.38 667.78 A: uh 

668.83 671.85 A: and there was something in england i heard on the radio 

672.49 673.15 A: there's uh 

674.01 675.56 A: uh a prison or something 

676.20 677.96 A: and they were putting people 

678.59 681.40 A: did you ever see the arnold schwarzenegger movie running man 

683.30 683.89 A: and it was
