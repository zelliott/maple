61.23 62.38 B: yeah 

63.45 63.94 B: cool 

63.50 64.29 A: mm 

64.60 65.07 A: yeah not

71.21 71.79 B: from 

71.91 74.95 B: from a different program i think biological thing 

75.83 76.43 B: yeah 

77.95 78.58 B: so 

80.21 81.91 A: um let's see 

80.83 81.41 B: yeah um 

82.21 83.03 B: the topic 

83.16 86.27 B: i heard it was about personal habits 

86.61 87.15 A: uh-huh 

87.32 87.71 B: right 

88.02 90.81 A: is that personal habits and the question was 

91.00 91.70 A: um 

91.81 94.40 B: which is worse do you think 

92.92 93.71 A: yeah like 

94.80 96.96 A: okay the choices where gossiping 

97.03 98.58 B: uh-huh smoking 

98.05 99.38 A: smoking 

99.17 100.87 B: drinking alcohol 

100.26 100.75 A: uh-huh 

100.85 103.36 A: eating to much i think and not exercising 

103.35 104.11 B: yeah 

104.33 105.19 A: um 

105.48 109.18 B: that's those are all yeah 

108.95 110.90 A: i don't know i admit that i gossip 

111.14 113.09 A: not maliciously i i should hope 

113.36 115.05 B: i think 

115.22 116.08 B: over eating 

116.35 118.62 B: and not exercising is really bad 

118.54 119.32 A: ye it's true 

119.24 129.97 B: actually i don't really exercise a lot and that's one of my problems i should work out regularly and i should work out regularly i just can't find enough time to do that 

119.57 120.36 A: although 

122.12 122.55 A: mm 

130.28 131.07 B: and 

130.42 130.92 A: mm 

131.20 132.80 B: and that makes me tiered 

133.15 133.75 B: sometimes 

134.35 137.89 A: yeah actually although i think with the alcohol and the smoking thing 

137.77 138.31 B: uh-huh 

138.59 141.77 A: simply because it's sort of something you choose to do 

141.78 142.15 B: right 

142.31 143.26 A: bad verses 

144.23 145.48 A: um it's bad if you 

145.74 146.74 A: don't do it 

146.92 147.76 A: i guess it's 

146.94 147.51 B: uh-huh 

148.12 149.86 A: sort of more of a choice 

150.34 152.31 A: what are those choices 

152.19 152.76 B: mm 

152.63 153.57 A: mm 

153.71 155.76 A: yeah like i guess i'm not 

156.72 159.34 A: like i don't really drink and i don't drink either 

159.86 163.45 B: oh wow what do you do when you hand out with people 

163.70 164.58 A: um 

165.63 169.70 A: i don't know maybe the problem is that we're really boring people 

169.75 171.82 B: science people 

171.61 175.57 A: yeah like all we do is like spas we we're like oh look 

175.67 176.18 B: yeah 

175.79 177.18 A: it's a molecule 

177.34 179.72 B: i understand you yeah 

177.42 178.65 A: and then we go crazy 

180.49 182.14 A: yeah i think we're just 

182.34 182.89 A: yeah 

183.13 185.26 A: it's just my group that's kind of 

185.56 186.53 A: bland i guess 

186.80 189.51 B: right how about oh how about caffeine but 

189.66 191.52 B: i think one of the yeah caffeine 

189.72 190.94 A: oh caffeine 

191.77 192.26 A: um 

192.64 195.49 A: i don't see anything wrong with caffeine actually 

195.46 196.09 B: mm 

196.11 196.73 A: um 

196.93 203.81 B: right i'm i'm really like addicted to coffee a lot i drink a lot of coffee and i don't know how 

204.04 206.24 B: that effects my health or 

206.66 213.99 B: cause i don't even see any problems yet maybe i'll see some late on in my life 

214.22 215.91 A: mm well they do say that 

216.32 219.43 A: actually moderate amounts help you feel better 

219.80 220.49 A: stuff like that 

220.49 221.09 B: right 

220.80 223.43 A: it's like the same thing with alcohol like something about 

223.56 225.18 A: a little bit of like red wine 

225.14 225.67 B: right 

226.62 229.61 B: that makes your liver circulating more 

230.24 231.24 B: better i i know 

230.93 232.49 A: no not the liver the heart 

232.37 233.49 B: the heart the the heart 

233.50 235.73 A: yeah it like helps to prevent heart disease 

235.87 236.52 B: uh-huh 

236.48 237.09 A: i think 

237.58 243.41 A: like i guess between alcohol and smoking i'd say smoking's worse because there are absolutely no health benefits to it 

243.44 245.36 B: yeah that's what i heard too 

245.77 246.87 A: yeah and caffeine 

246.97 248.03 A: yeah i don't know 

248.27 252.36 A: i guess some people consider it a drug too but i kind of like frapachinos 

252.61 254.27 B: you like cappuccino yeah 

255.22 256.00 A: mm 

255.64 256.40 B: mm 

257.61 258.73 B: um 

259.51 263.92 B: yeah i don't know coffees just so popular everywhere these days and 

264.11 264.55 A: mm 

264.75 275.94 B: if if there's really like a serious problem with the caffeine then then there should be a lot of them worries like people who worry about smoking they 

276.16 286.29 B: they are a lot of activist against smoking and high smoking but they i haven't really seen many people who are opposed to caffeine 

280.32 280.88 A: yeah 

286.51 287.32 A: yeah true 

287.15 289.39 B: it's kind of a different situation i think 

289.71 291.21 A: actually have you ever seen 

291.43 294.25 A: have you seen this new drink out called vinergy 

294.66 295.27 B: um n- 

294.90 295.45 A: and it's 

295.53 296.38 B: not really 

296.38 297.70 A: oh it's got um 

298.05 299.79 A: number one it's like carbonated 

299.65 300.06 B: uh-huh 

300.06 304.57 A: and it's got it's basically carbonated wine that they added caffeine too 

304.25 304.65 B: right 

305.24 306.18 A: which is 

306.32 315.42 A: interesting because caffeine's like you know a stimulant and alcohol's a suppressant so i'm not entirely sure what the effect off two of them together will be 

307.14 308.25 B: uh 

315.16 315.90 B: yeah 

316.08 316.93 B: (( or the of )) 

317.09 318.08 B: have you ever tried it 

318.81 321.12 A: i haven't no i've seen ads for it around though 

320.97 321.65 B: uh-huh 

322.13 322.51 B: uh 

323.67 324.33 B: yeah 

325.10 327.93 B: even tea also have some caffeine inside 

328.03 328.66 A: uh-huh 

328.54 330.42 B: do you drink tea do you like tea 

330.40 331.62 A: um a little bit 

331.95 332.55 B: yeah 

332.33 334.06 A: yeah just when it's cold 

340.30 345.61 B: coffee at night just right before they go to sleep and the (( )) can't sleep enough to drinking coffee at night 

345.36 345.87 A: yeah 

345.78 346.18 B: um 

346.29 347.88 B: but i just i have 

348.59 354.19 B: been drinking too much coffee and then i even i i sleep really well even though i 

353.81 355.24 A: wow 

354.50 356.36 B: and then instead of problem (( )) 

356.62 359.15 A: no probably not it's just your body's gotten use to it 

359.28 363.05 B: maybe it's my body just (( )) 

361.56 367.98 A: yeah cause my roommate like if she drinks coffee anytime after twelve noon 

367.90 368.30 B: right 

368.23 370.33 A: then she just basically can't sleep at night 

370.44 371.25 B: wow 

371.36 375.37 A: yeah like i'm not that extreme actually i don't think caffeine does anything to me 

375.46 376.08 B: uh-huh 

376.65 377.07 A: but 

376.79 377.99 B: that's interesting 

377.98 378.51 A: yeah 

379.89 380.44 B: right 

381.09 382.91 A: yeah i suppose 

383.90 385.74 B: how about overeating 

385.57 388.98 A: overeating's very bad i do that 

386.97 387.67 B: yeah 

388.06 389.02 B: um 

389.20 391.90 B: so are you a senior or what's your ranking

411.02 412.87 B: and do that all the time 

412.56 422.31 A: no yeah it's just like when you get busy or else your like you know i'm so lazy i'd rather just sit here and be comfortable 

413.77 415.06 B: yeah i mean 

420.19 421.09 B: lazy 

422.64 423.34 B: right 

423.72 428.11 B: i mean i think i personally i think it's important to work out regularly and

429.41 431.38 B: body healthy 

430.51 434.90 A: true yeah it totally does like i here people say that you know 

433.15 433.75 B: yeah 

435.07 439.29 A: it gives them energy right after they do it and then they can be more efficient and like

536.15 536.42 A: yep

545.18 546.26 B: yeah ha ha ha 

546.11 553.23 A: so we tend to have like it snows and it like grows for a day and then the next day sun the sunshines and the snow and then it melts 

551.97 552.65 B: right 

552.98 553.66 B: yeah 

553.59 554.42 A: very interesting 

554.81 556.69 B: yeah oh my gosh yeah

559.13 560.40 A: heh heh 

560.70 561.92 B: okay 

561.90 562.98 A: hm 

563.07 563.99 B: um did 

564.67 565.97 B: is there any other topic 

566.08 566.85 B: other than 

567.06 569.45 A: the oh we didn't talk about gossiping 

567.47 567.99 B: (( what )) 

569.23 574.54 B: oh gosh (( )) cause i don't really i'm not really into gossiping (( a whole lot )) 

570.39 571.22 A: mm 

574.47 576.95 A: hm i guess gossiping in terms of 

578.14 578.80 A: hm 

579.16 581.69 A: cause like here we have like a little group 

581.65 582.36 B: uh-huh 

581.81 588.35 A: a sort of what we call a blocking group which is basically you go to a dorm with like seven of your closest friends 

588.01 588.94 B: yeah 

588.99 591.64 A: so it's sort of like our main little like social group 

591.70 592.33 B: mhm 

591.91 592.62 A: and like 

593.61 594.31 B: right 

594.00 596.69 A: it's always interesting to talk about guys 

596.49 597.57 B: ha ha ha ha 

597.51 600.06 A: like i'm not sure if that counts as gossiping or not 

599.90 603.60 B: uh what's your definition of of gossiping 

603.89 604.81 A: um 

605.42 605.99 A: hm 

606.29 609.37 A: uh maybe i guess gossiping has more the 

609.63 610.98 A: meaning of um 

612.22 614.85 A: like to say bad things about people 

615.06 616.57 A: behind their back i guess 

616.03 617.58 B: (( instead of )) um negative 

617.78 619.09 B: term for you then 

619.56 621.07 A: i think so 

619.87 620.60 B: gossiping 

620.85 621.30 B: uh-huh 

621.43 624.29 A: yeah gossiping versus say um chatting i guess 

624.58 626.66 B: so yeah those are different things uh 

626.57 627.09 A: yeah 

627.53 628.73 B: yeah 

629.33 630.21 B: gossiping 

630.92 632.54 B: is just talking about other people 

632.93 633.80 B: um 

633.07 633.55 A: yeah 

634.12 634.42 B: (( but )) 

635.29 635.59 B: there 

635.89 637.03 B: bad things ha ha 

637.00 637.54 A: yeah 

637.65 638.70 A: imagine that's kind of 

639.76 640.25 A: hm 

640.90 642.94 A: yeah although there's not very much to talk about 

643.08 643.52 B: right 

644.43 648.40 B: but wh- when you when you talk about guys with your friends what do you talk about them 

648.67 651.95 A: um let's it either they're cute or they're not 

651.88 652.83 B: okay 

652.93 653.73 A: so i guess 

654.46 659.26 A: when we're talking about how they're not or how they're like obnoxious i guess that would be called gossiping
