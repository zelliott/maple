70.30 79.10 A: yeah oh gosh yeah that's true that's true that was one of 'em okay let go go over these again for me let's see i know the gossiping

81.75 82.58 A: right

90.55 101.65 B: i'm not even reme- i may be making this up [laughter] i remember what as i was listening to it i remembered smoking was gonna be my answer but and gossiping is not since i like to [mn] do that myself 

93.02 95.16 A: yeah oh well [laughter] 

101.03 115.41 A: oh oh well see as soon as i heard gossiping i you know that was the first one and i though ooh that's really bad you know and and you know things like drinking and all that stuff and those are personal choices but gossiping hurts o- other people 

107.40 109.10 B: [laughter] 

113.05 119.08 B: gossiping i guess negatively yes it it especially if they find out about it [laughter]

118.65 120.76 A: yeah yeah 

120.40 125.20 B: so okay so your answer is gossiping because it will hurt other people's feelings

129.22 130.39 A: um 

132.89 135.12 A: that's true you know i think i 

134.12 136.96 B: i guess you could die of mouth cancer [laughter] 

136.18 139.48 A: think i'd have to agree with you because smoking 

137.44 138.57 B: [laughter] 

139.62 143.00 A: smoking damages other people through secondhand smoke 

141.67 143.57 B: yeah secondhand smoke

152.66 160.44 B: yes yes well it [laughter] gossiping could cost like us friends if you c- [laughter] if you have to keep replacing them [laughter] [mn] 

153.64 154.79 A: you know it costs 

159.72 169.41 A: right right but then yeah you have to consider the uh public health hazards and uh things like that yeah n- oh gosh 

166.73 167.66 B: (( and )) 

168.76 172.09 B: i guess like pollution but i i'm trying to think and i guess 

171.90 173.23 B: overeating 

173.04 183.96 B: well let's see caffeine my mom my parents both drink caffeine and i'm only like five feet tall so i think it may have stunted my growth [laughter] because my mom drank coffee when i was when she was pregnant with me maybe 

179.78 181.42 A: oh 

183.75 188.40 B: maybe caffeine is bad but um [laughter] i don't know if that might be a rumor 

185.43 189.87 A: oh no no oh i don't 

188.83 190.79 B: that's not the worst thing [mn] 

190.29 200.36 A: i don't think so i mean my mother smoked the entire time she was pregnant with me so you know and um she thinks i'm overly sensitive to tobacco smoke 

191.41 192.11 B: (( oh )) 

193.85 195.75 B: (( [laughter] oh )) 

199.96 201.33 B: (( oh mhm )) 

200.66 209.81 A: she she's a radical smoker she's in her eighties she lives in connecticut that's where i grew up and uh yeah she uh she's gotten a little bit better 

210.26 215.17 A: i mean because the world has changed so much but you know when when they were banning smoking 

215.37 224.14 A: a lot um she just uh oh she couldn't stand to ride in an aeroplane you know [laughter] yeah 

220.19 221.57 B: uh-huh

227.24 228.65 A: (( yeah )) 

227.62 232.29 B: like way of life if you can't like adjust to not being able to 

232.44 246.67 B: either smoke or not be able to like be next to a smoker or do they have um like a smoking well i'm sorry if i'm like losing it today [mn] i was like probably going round saying stuff my answer or doesn't make any sense oh

298.24 302.77 A: well i'm from the east coast i grew up in connecticut yeah and 

301.65 309.78 B: you don't sound very west coast so i couldn't exactly place your accent i wasn't listening at as intently as my usual [mn] 

309.03 310.25 A: uh-huh 

309.94 313.68 B: some i like accents but yeah you sound kind of east coast in your

344.85 346.60 A: right right 

345.23 359.63 B: so i kind of i kind of know her even though i don't um i'm i'm not in the socio linguistics department as she you know i i was doing the computational type but um i like to annoy her because i feel like because i'm from new york and 

354.46 355.29 A: uh-huh 

359.35 360.02 A: (( [mn] )) 

359.82 372.89 B: you know she has this whole like new york jewish thing going on so i always like go over to her and annoy her for no apparent reason everyone's very respectful of her except for me [laughter] so she knows [mn] i feel like we're old buddies now even though like [laughter] i'm just a g 

362.65 363.60 A: uh-huh 

367.92 368.85 A: [laughter]

381.94 383.00 A: uh-huh 

384.57 396.05 B: so um yeah i i uh i know what you're talking about though her an- analysis of the conversation with the new yorkers they just dominate like the whole entire like thanksgiving dinner or something 

391.84 392.81 A: right 

395.00 402.59 A: right and and they feel like they're bonding very nicely with the other new yorkers but the californians feel like they're being attacked

438.86 450.42 A: wow well when i i took a course in computational linguistics now i graduated in seventy nine i mean it was practically punch cards [laughter]

543.71 546.77 B: like yeah let them kill each other [laughter] 

546.80 553.06 B: that's so funny like if you you know i know um i roomed with a girl from oregon or as she says oregon 

553.15 554.13 A: right 

553.22 565.63 B: and she i i've been talking and she'll go like shh like to for me to lower my voice i'm like what i'm the only one you know we were rooming and i knew we were the only ones home i'm like who are we waking up there's no one in the house she's like 

564.89 566.38 A: [laughter] 

565.48 576.37 B: lower your voice i'm like you know i happen to have sensitive hear- like sensitive ears so if i was that loud i know i'd be hurting my own ears so it wasn't like you know the pain threshold or anything like that 

572.45 573.41 A: uh-huh 

575.95 577.07 A: (( oh god )) 

576.27 586.28 B: but um she would just always shush me and i thought it was the rudest thing i've ever heard like who would shush you know like the last time i was shushed was in like the first grade when i talked too much in art classes like you know 

585.26 587.16 A: [laughter] 

586.22 598.99 B: like a friend to shush me because like you know lower doing like the hand signal like you know lower your voice i'm like oh that is so obnoxious [laughter] but i guess to her like i was you know completely offensive to the ears 

594.34 595.62 A: [laughter] 

598.81 606.09 A: well that's really interesting yeah i i have a good friend um i went i actually went to the university of connecticut for two years 

605.63 606.68 B: (( oh wow )) 

606.07 612.10 A: and i met um a friend there who's still a real good friend and and she's like her parents are like your 

612.01 623.94 A: loud new york jewish people but she grew up in connecticut and it's very bizarre she was interesting to me actually she was the first person i knew who ever majored in linguistics so she was rather an inspiration 

621.37 622.41 B: (( wow )) 

623.32 624.52 B: [laughter] 

624.03 629.48 A: and uh she has a very strong new york accent and her younger sisters don't at all 

628.97 629.92 B: oh 

629.45 641.54 A: um but yeah when we would get on the phone when when i was at georgetown and my room mates would you know like i would get louder because she would be loud and and i would be practically yelling [laughter] [laughter] 

638.74 640.59 B: yeah oh my god and 

640.48 651.83 B: and on the phone my friends like would always say my accent got worse or something you know and like i don't know to me i i don't think i you know change around but i guess in class i'd try to kind of curb the you know 

651.62 665.17 B: like the my first day of georgetown um it was actually my second uh first class of my second semester i was in an english class and they made us i hate reading like plays because i don't like to get into them like some of the people in class and they had to read this 

663.38 664.41 A: (( mhm )) 

665.11 666.68 B: this shakespearean 

666.58 672.17 B: play line and it was some it quotes somebody sounded like an incredulous dog 

671.96 675.98 B: and i said the word dog and half the class just started like 

675.76 688.23 B: laughing themselves to death and they're like say it again coffee pot dog and they would like all and i'm like no this is a great way to like disrupt the entire class i'll just just ra- whenever i know now the answer i'll just 

680.02 681.63 A: [laughter] 

688.27 693.32 B: you know make sure i say a word with the or sound and they'll all just be like complete anarchy 

690.65 691.64 A: uh-huh 

692.99 700.17 A: well that that's one of the few things i say that i think makes me sound like that that i say coffee yeah 

699.48 701.41 B: yeah it sounds nice 

700.37 703.27 A: and i guess i say dog 

703.12 716.51 A: and uh i mean very few other words i mean i grew up in fairfield which was you know i mean close enough to the city and my parents were both from the city and um but that's the only thing i bring with me but you really notice it out here 

716.55 719.89 A: um like i work with several people i ha-
