0.23 1.25 A: (( hello )) 

2.16 3.76 A: my name's ted 

3.08 4.92 B: hi i'm bridgette 

4.26 5.78 A: cool where do you live 

5.96 7.60 B: um i'm in boston 

7.27 9.73 A: oh cool i'm in in columbus ohio 

9.65 10.66 B: oh nice 

11.25 14.01 A: so do you watch any uh reality television shows 

13.91 15.95 B: i actually don't do you 

15.61 21.39 A: no i don't either well unless you count the news i suppose that's sort of the the ultimate reality television show 

21.17 22.14 B: [laughter] 

21.89 22.83 A: (( i mean )) 

23.18 33.31 A: that that's the thing that truly boggles m- boggles the mind because uh you end up with you know news shows that i mean the media in general sort of mass television stuff ends up so 

33.10 38.85 A: like bland and sterile that people do anything to you know watch actual people do things 

38.72 39.95 B: yeah for sure 

39.61 51.11 A: and so i mean like that's actually y- you can draw the exact same analogy with the news you have things like you know c._n._n. or fox news or whatever and i much prefer watching cspan and watching actually people who actually do things 

51.38 53.11 B: yeah i love cspan [noise] 

52.76 56.11 A: yeah and so th- that that's sort of been my uh 

55.93 69.74 A: take over the past year or so it's just like i'm i've completely given up on the television news and trying to get actual information from it so i've just started watching cspan the really cool thing about cspan is that you know since they're 

69.91 78.34 A: obviously proceedings only go on during the day and so they'll uh play all sorts of interesting interesting things at night i got to watch um an a._e._p. 

79.01 84.48 A: thing on um which isn't the american electric uh power company um 

82.23 83.34 B: mhm 

84.57 89.74 A: on uh how they're rebuilding afghanistan which is very interesting 

89.21 90.41 B: oh i bet 

90.33 98.12 A: um the the thing that's always boggled my mind a- about reality television shows as well is uh the the whole uh 

98.14 103.41 A: interest factor for the enlarged bulk of american people and things like that 

102.92 106.02 B: [noise] yeah it's kind of this weird like um 

106.14 109.57 B: uh what's the word kind of voyeuristic thing 

109.31 110.59 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

109.98 117.83 B: and the people who go on it i can't understand their mentality either my um my mom's cousin went on that blind date show 

117.47 118.54 A: oh really 

118.19 131.95 B: and he had like the worst time on there and just got humiliated on you know national t._v. it was horrible but i have a tape of it and it's so funny but i mean i felt so bad for him [laughter] 

128.44 129.64 A: [laughter] 

131.15 143.64 A: right well those shows in particular i i really don't understand because who'd want to participate because obviously you're probably not going to end up with anybody in the first place although i th- i think that's happened a couple of times that i've been randomly skipping through channels 

143.45 151.29 A: but otherwise i mean you get humiliated everybody laughs at your expense and the shows are so mindless that i wouldn't understand why you'd want to watch them anyway 

151.12 157.61 B: yeah exactly i mean it it's gotta be just some weird i don't know urge that i can't understand at least 

157.33 163.51 A: well the ironic thing is here we are participating w- with a study talking to relative strangers but [laughter] 

162.66 167.07 B: (( yeah [laughter] there's a little irony in that isn't there [mn] )) 

163.89 164.82 A: [laughter] 

166.31 167.04 A: yeah 

167.28 177.80 A: but uh the really crazy thing is um like the japanese have been doing this for much much longer than americans have and uh the the reality television shows that they have 

177.40 178.68 B: [noise] 

177.88 181.67 A: like blow anything that the americans could possibly do away 

181.82 183.00 B: oh really [noise] 

182.31 187.40 A: yeah there's this one called uh eggplant boy or something like that where they um 

187.48 189.46 A: they basically uh 

189.49 199.62 A: asked a bunch of actors if they were um uh interviewed a bunch of actors and then they kidnapped one put him in a room locked him in there and he was supposed to survive 

199.68 203.99 A: um merely on um like mailing contests 

204.16 213.25 A: so they like stripped him down totally naked and the reason why it was called eggplant boy is they'd always cover his uh uh lower uh nether regions with an eggplant 

204.57 205.50 B: [laughter] 

212.70 214.62 B: [laughter] 

213.48 226.20 A: um and he he ended up just like living in there and like sending away all these uh things in the mail and uh he he'd you know end up you know finally getting food or whatever after a while and things like that and uh 

221.10 221.93 B: (( [noise] )) 

225.47 226.86 B: oh my god 

227.02 236.96 A: yeah that that sounded considerably more uh dramatic and uh people were sort of worried about the human rights ramifications of that particular show but apparently it was very entertaining 

235.14 242.41 B: yeah apparently [laughter] no food for a week [laughter] wow that's crazy 

238.63 239.69 A: yeah 

242.35 251.09 A: yeah it's it's amazing what people will put on television now the the interesting thing is watching all these spin off shows like particular like the blind date shows and things like that 

250.75 251.61 B: yeah 

251.50 261.07 A: t._l._c. actually has blind date shows where people's friends will pick other people up so you know the dates actually tend to work out or you know people actually have a fun time 

259.22 260.06 B: uh-huh 

260.80 261.76 B: mhm 

260.90 274.85 A: and there's no like audience to you know laugh at the expense of these people or whatever and those are i mean like i i actually those are fairly interesting um t._l._c. has like become like my new addiction as far as television goes 

274.13 275.04 B: uh-huh 

274.89 280.56 A: and they've got all sorts of really cool shows uh mainly home improvement shows those things are really cool 

279.98 283.56 B: oh yeah i love those too changing spaces and all those shows 

283.03 289.63 A: yeah and then w- uh there let's see also the um the empty barge uh 

289.68 295.52 A: and various mechanical things like gr- uh junkyard wars and uh full metal challenge or whatever 

295.19 296.19 B: [laughter] 

296.20 297.61 B: yeah 

297.62 304.29 B: unfortunately i you know in my dorm i get three channels i get n._b._c. a._b._c. and p._b._s. 

303.72 304.99 A: (( oh [mn] )) 

304.30 306.83 B: so i'm quite limited [laughter] 

306.39 311.25 A: yeah i- in so you're probably a college student then as well 

311.11 312.18 B: yeah 

311.56 312.50 A: um 

312.52 314.91 A: what u- university do you go to out of curiosity 

314.20 315.40 B: i'm at harvard 

314.98 317.68 A: oh you're at harvard cool i've got a friend who goes there 

315.84 316.78 B: mhm 

317.64 318.63 B: oh really 

318.14 322.14 A: yeah her name's jan although i haven't i'm pretty sure you probably don't know her [mn] yeah 

321.55 324.70 B: no probably not it's a big place i don't know anyone [mn] 

324.61 331.93 A: yeah but that's sort of the uh harvard seems like a very interesting place my mother did her masters there but 

331.38 332.13 B: uh-huh 

331.95 335.32 A: and i've visited the campus i really like harvard square it's very interesting 

334.73 336.18 B: yeah it's very fun 

336.75 338.79 A: but yeah i'm at o._s._u. 

338.82 344.41 A: (( ohio state yeah but uh let's see what were we talking about )) 

339.09 339.86 B: cool 

339.91 340.75 B: cool 

344.75 347.42 B: uh t._l._c. i think we were talking about 

346.77 355.80 A: oh yeah well i don't have a t._v. in my room unfortunately so some of my suite mates have you know televisions and things i usually end up usually watching t._v. when i'm back at my parents' house or whatever 

352.45 353.60 B: mhm 

356.59 357.35 A: (( so )) 

357.55 364.18 A: i mean it's weird because my my dad was gone for three months and i was sort of like staying at his house and uh 

364.77 372.00 A: so he he had only the basic cable so we could keep road runner connected um and so i mean 

369.08 369.81 B: mhm 

371.91 383.38 A: there [mn] no music television type shows which aren't really music any more anyway so who cares um the the major thing that i was missing was like you know the food network which is great to watch i 

377.12 377.89 B: (( yeah )) 

382.72 385.61 B: oh yeah oh yeah [mn] 

383.54 384.53 A: mean 

386.00 397.38 A: i mean it it's weird to see all these the the truly interesting cable shows are you know ones that are all these like weird specialty networks and things like that so i've completely given up on main stream media 

396.70 407.08 B: yeah me too i i love the food network and um like discovery channel and that kind of thing i like watching the sort of realistic shows 

407.54 418.21 A: right yeah it's it's sort of weird so i mean like the the truly interesting things are the r- i mean the shows about reality but the reality television itself is sort of uh 

418.28 419.66 A: uh disturbing 

419.59 423.34 B: yeah it's not my reality you know [laughter] 

421.74 422.63 A: (( right [mn] )) 

424.17 435.83 A: yeah it's it's much more interesting seeing actual people do things as opposed to people who show up for a t._v. show and go okay we're supposed to make things happen like my my room mate always watches the real world which is interesting 

431.49 432.40 B: yeah 

434.59 436.20 B: oh yeah on m._t._v. 

436.04 450.30 A: yeah o- and and and the fact that regardless of who's on the show a fight always breaks out i i've never understood that [mn] i can't i mean like i suppose that's the appeal and everything but i mean like if i wanted to see people argue and fight i just have to you know like 

443.11 443.99 B: yeah 

450.09 452.82 A: talk to my girlfriend about what her room mate's doing 

452.53 453.85 B: [laughter] 

453.09 458.34 A: [laughter] which is you know ten times worse than the real world could ever be so 

457.45 459.03 B: yeah really [noise] 

458.45 470.23 A: i mean wha [mn] i i guess people are you know want to [mn] i mean like i suppose the usual line is people want to um you know spice up their 

470.13 476.30 A: life and watching other people argue or something i have no idea 

477.28 480.08 B: i don't know very strange to me 

479.94 491.81 A: yeah also it seems sort of odd because you really don't get i mean it's very like sterile and you don't really get to meet interesting people i guess i mean like they have 

491.88 505.93 A: i mean since all those have screened i mean if you've been to harvard for a while well i doubt actually real world comes there but the real world occasionally comes by columbus and says you know anybody want to try out or whatever um and then 

500.74 502.01 B: mhm 

506.43 521.40 A: you know they they screen whoever the contestants are and then they ship them off to whatever city and a fight breaks out like now do they plan that do they go okay yeah their personalities are going to clash so we need to put them in a room together [laughter] i mean like that seems 

512.36 513.40 B: mhm 

519.42 521.16 B: [laughter] 

521.95 523.44 A: perverse 

523.11 525.05 B: yeah pretty twisted 

526.15 540.80 B: yeah i've always kind of wondered whether they have like a psychologist working behind the scenes like oh let's let's try to get personalities that just really are not gonna work and then we'll just get the two that are just absolutely like the love match 

526.17 527.30 A: yeah quite strange 

531.44 532.66 A: [laughter] 

540.79 541.63 B: (( you know )) 

541.28 553.31 A: right well the the interesting thing is like you know everybody or or a few of the people will be dating people you know and now that they've moved away from wherever they're living you know you have a long distance relationship going on 

552.23 553.07 B: yeah 

553.26 558.34 A: and see how they're you know trying to screw with people's relationships and stuff like that it's like 

557.28 558.62 B: mhm 

558.56 561.02 A: how incredibly demented we 

561.04 562.22 A: i i mean 

562.63 568.07 A: disturbing is this i mean they're trying to like mess with people's lives it's like 

566.78 568.64 B: yeah exactly 

568.54 574.94 A: and i i suppose they're signing waivers i mean you know they they say okay sure abuse me however you want but still 

573.95 581.87 B: yes i guess like whatever psychological damage you cause i'm not going to hold you responsible for [laughter] seems like these people are going to end up pretty messed up 

577.88 579.25 A: [laughter] right 

581.40 590.20 A: right and i mean i suppose the the allure is large sums of money and i mean the same thing happens to you know like microsoft interns [mn] 

586.54 587.66 B: yeah 

590.16 591.43 B: [laughter] 

591.92 595.37 A: please sign away your your uh mental health for money please 

595.15 596.33 B: yeah really 

595.62 596.20 A: (( [mn] )) 

597.01 597.79 B: (( [laughter] )) 

597.41 602.65 A: so i don't know it it's seems to be a fairly bizarre phenomena but i guess 

601.54 604.22 B: yeah i i would agree with that 

603.66 606.24 A: not entirely a 

606.40 614.66 A: i guess it is reality i- in a way but only on a mental level if you're actually watching the show and you think that that's real then you know that's not really 

614.63 617.61 B: i think you have problems if you think [laughter] that's a reality 

617.42 625.01 A: right which is kind of weird because then i guess you're just saying that real life is like real life if you're talking about the mental levels of a television show [laughter] 

624.84 628.62 B: [laughter] oh boy crazy 

627.69 628.71 A: uh 

629.46 634.39 B: well i don't know what we're supposed to do with this thing are we supposed to just keep talking is it going to tell us 

633.81 644.42 A: yeah um i had a session yesterday and you just keep on talking for ten minutes and then they give you thirty seconds at the end and uh to say goodbye and things like that so uh 

643.75 644.84 B: oh okay 

644.55 648.43 A: um i don't know how long we've been talking but i suppose we should keep talking 

648.25 650.72 B: oh well that's fine um 

649.58 650.42 A: yeah 

651.44 656.66 B: i think if they count who wants to be a millionaire as the reality t._v. show 

654.78 656.06 A: yeah that was 

656.07 664.29 A: that was one of the things that they they suggested i don't know yeah it's kind of curious where they draw the line between you know game show and reality television 

657.02 657.82 B: (( i guess )) 

664.17 669.74 B: yeah because to me i mean i would watch that show that's not really too far beyond the pale for me 

669.31 670.13 A: uh-huh 

669.58 679.29 B: um they actually do recruit a lot of people for that show from here and um yeah one of my friends whose um our linguistics leader that's how i heard about this survey 

673.45 674.37 A: oh really 

678.57 679.80 A: (( oh yeah )) 

679.34 680.47 B: um 

680.53 683.15 B: was on it and won sixteen thousand bucks 

682.94 683.89 A: cool 

683.27 685.16 B: so that was pretty good yeah 

685.07 692.37 A: yeah it was kind of funny because that particular show was um driving the network crazy because what people would do was rather than go for the you know 

692.47 702.33 A: million at the end with the really hard questions they'd just get up to a point where they had a whole lot of money and then call it quits [laughter] so apparently the network was was losing tons of money with that it was like oh 

698.58 699.93 B: yeah [laughter] 

701.35 703.69 B: yeah they want people to lose big time 

703.34 704.48 A: yeah 

703.95 709.68 B: if they give out a a million bucks once it's a lot better than giving out sixty four thousand a lot of times 

709.37 715.59 A: right and th- that that's sort of the the funny thing but i think they revamped the show or something like that i don't know 

715.05 717.27 B: oh have they i haven't seen it in so long 

716.97 719.90 A: i think i've only seen like one or two episodes i i was ne-
