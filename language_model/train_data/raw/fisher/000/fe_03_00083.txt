59.10 63.27 B: t._v. shows and you have people swallowing worms and eating fire 

63.42 64.89 B: it seems as though it's uh 

65.03 67.05 B: purely for the shock factor that i 

67.17 68.80 B: that i think people find it compelling 

69.26 70.12 A: yeah 

69.65 69.94 B: uh 

70.20 71.18 B: if nothing else 

71.28 73.33 A: uh i'd i would agree with that yeah 

71.37 71.80 B: uh 

73.80 76.26 A: and i guess what i don't understand is why do 

73.88 74.36 B: uh 

74.87 75.23 B: go ahead 

76.40 80.69 A: eh and i know you can't answer for most people and neither can i but why 

79.49 79.87 B: sure 

81.15 81.91 A: people 

82.33 88.88 A: find i think they find it escapist they these people you know mo- most of the people who watch are never going to have lead an exciting life 

89.73 91.16 B: uh this is true 

90.85 100.83 A: thus so what they're doing is they're saying oh my if it were me on the desert island or if it were me walking across a tight-rope or eating worms or whatever you know what would i do 

101.44 102.97 A: it's pure escapism 

102.94 110.98 B: yeah i would (( )) agree and i think um just to if i had to was really forced to look into it further i think these ac- shows actually began on m._t._v. 

111.18 117.69 B: of all places uh with uh shows like um oh i ca- can't think of the actual name of it there was a character that was quite famous on it called puck 

118.15 121.96 B: who uh and it was i think that the appeal is that it's not uh 

122.45 126.06 B: prepared for it's totally it's totally real it's not scripted 

126.53 132.89 B: uh and and i think that people can uh associate with that because it's real and it's not um acted 

133.10 133.67 B: per se 

133.85 142.14 A: yeah but people are so mediocre eh i mean if that's the ca- if it's really that scripted then by god people are boring you know 

136.35 138.34 B: yeah 

140.06 140.33 B: hm 

141.74 147.21 B: yeah i i there there's no uh disagreement here i mean i would much prefer something that is 

147.60 149.51 B: uh acted if it's acted well 

149.64 150.11 A: hm mhm 

149.86 155.55 B: i mean shows like e._r. uh c._s._i. which is one of my favorite x files one of my favorite um 

154.99 160.50 A: sure because that takes thought and you're you're actually getting from place a to place b with a little bit of thought 

160.73 165.74 B: right and you can actually then comment on the writer or you can comment on the casting you can comment on the acting 

165.81 166.60 A: yeah yeah 

166.36 166.82 B: uh but 

167.04 173.67 B: any kind of shock factor or whatever it is that they find um it's interesting that we are talking about this because 

173.94 175.97 B: it's a situation where neither one of us watch them 

176.42 185.91 B: i mean it'd be different if uh if i was someone who's really an avid viewer it would be an interesting uh conversation perhaps even further but um i i concur i mean i don't find it appealing and i i 

186.12 189.43 B: i'm sometimes at a loss finding out w- you know why do people find it appealing 

189.72 195.84 A: yeah and and like i say it's beyond me what what i know i get from my teenagers or from my twenty year old daughter 

195.95 196.31 A: so 

196.07 196.78 B: yep yep 

196.65 203.87 A: it's hard to say now do y- are they lumping in and here's a definitional question are they lumping in 

204.39 209.42 A: shows like uh who wants to be millionaire or jeopardy you know the fact based show 

209.56 210.16 A: shows 

210.36 210.77 B: yep 

210.69 211.15 A: and do this 

211.80 212.07 A: cause 

211.80 218.85 B: i it it actually that's interesting that you point that out because um the the operator that preceded our conversation seemed to indicate 

219.18 222.35 B: who wants billion be millionaire group in with survivor 

222.63 224.34 B: and i don't see the parallel at all 

224.43 231.45 A: yeah to me they would be totally different something like like who wants to be a millionaire or jeopardy or or what's that other one missing link 

226.66 227.07 B: and b- 

231.97 233.93 A: or or or weakest link weakest link 

232.04 232.41 B: right 

233.61 237.03 B: weakest link i i i think it would have been a more of an appropriate comparison 

234.50 234.92 A: um 

237.12 240.56 B: they said uh survivor and the amazing race 

241.18 244.20 B: uh is one that's also uh not scripted 

244.52 247.18 B: uh and there are a few others uh the bachelor 

247.95 249.47 B: uh brother big brother 

249.71 253.96 A: oh see i you're you're you're i those those i have no clue what you're talking about 

258.60 259.62 B: in fact uh it's a 

258.66 259.01 A: yeah 

259.77 264.09 B: often the topic of conversation at work and i'm i'm a i usually say talk to the guy in the next cube 

264.18 266.91 A: yeah right cause i i have no idea what it is 

264.50 265.63 B: uh because 

266.48 270.35 B: i i really don't um i usually end up seeing it's interesting i i usually end up seeing who 

270.67 278.82 B: who actually is the person who gets booted off of survivor island because again it happens at the end of the show and i'm changing channels to get ready to watch c._s._i. 

278.90 279.87 A: yeah right 

279.28 282.65 B: that's the only reason why it's my only attachment to that show 

282.59 288.80 A: yeah tha- tha- that's interesting yeah i i agree with you i agree with you on that you know i i know what little bit i know because 

288.93 290.38 A: i hear it from other people 

298.56 299.02 B: who are 

299.14 299.75 B: age 

300.48 301.09 B: bracket 

301.34 305.40 B: who actually do watch the show wondering is wondering if it's po- probably a generational thing 

307.03 311.36 B: i mean i'm thirty two and outside from a woman at my work who's in her forties 

311.73 315.77 B: uh the ones that seem to be uh attached to that show are of a younger crowd 

316.72 318.18 B: and i'm wondering if that might play a role 

317.43 326.59 A: i would agree with you on that i don't know anybody over let's say twenty five or twenty six 

326.34 326.73 B: hm mhm 

326.76 328.07 A: who watches these things 

328.23 330.37 A: with any degree of regularity 

330.85 333.97 B: yeah interesting and maybe that's a i don't know maybe that's a point to be made 

338.10 338.47 A: network 

341.29 342.48 A: sell the advertising they want 

342.92 346.39 A: they don't want they don't want i i'm forty eight they don't want a forty eight year old man 

342.94 343.26 B: yep 

346.77 349.36 A: you know they they want some twenty year old kid who's got 

349.49 351.58 A: you know who who doesn't have responsibilities 

358.33 362.59 B: one of a the associates at my work their nephew was actually going to be 

362.87 365.64 B: a person participating in some show that's but it's going to be 

365.76 367.77 B: the the premise is that it's on a yacht 

368.06 368.93 B: it's on like a boat 

369.25 371.34 B: and he's one of these people he's going to be one of the cast 

371.56 371.87 A: hm 

371.64 373.74 B: characters on the show but again 

373.94 376.08 B: uh we're talking about someone who's of college age 

376.44 382.50 B: uh and i don't kn- may- maybe it's just more uh maybe it's just more a generational thing i mean i don't see the appeal to it i really don't 

382.50 390.61 A: yeah yeah to me neither but but flipping back to the uh you know to the to the uh quiz show as opposed to the reality show 

390.43 390.82 B: okay 

390.71 396.99 A: those i'm engaged i i those engage me i i i'll look at something like who wants to be a millionaire or 

397.08 403.06 A: or um the weakest link and i can answer most of those questions and i start i find myself 

399.63 399.94 B: yep 

403.52 406.80 A: trying to beat the fellow on t._v. with the right answer 

407.00 410.11 B: i i uh com- completely concur with that 

409.40 418.82 A: yeah and and to me that that's more inv- and again that may be generational because we i have a greater life experience and maybe more knowledge than some of these other guys do 

418.29 419.04 B: yeah and 

419.21 422.18 A: but but to me that those are more whole lot more engaging 

419.28 420.13 B: go ahead 

422.49 427.49 B: i would agree i i like the idea um competing along with say jeopardy and 

427.78 434.65 B: and (( )) if i knew a certain thing or just shouting it out and kind of like uh y- people in the room and you just kind of make a game out of it 

434.89 436.57 B: uh it seems much more engaging 

435.31 435.68 A: hm mhm 

436.76 440.91 A: well yeah mean you're you're i don't know if you're old enough to remember trivial pursuit remember trivial pursuit 

436.92 437.34 B: um 

440.62 442.35 B: oh sure yeah i'm thirty two 

441.94 451.19 A: okay okay well sure that was a real hit about ten fifteen years ago and it was great because you kept on pulling those cards out and you could really show how much little crap you knew 

446.03 446.55 B: yep 

453.13 453.95 B: right 

457.35 459.08 A: what most of these game s- these 

459.43 464.53 A: like jeopardy or or or millionaire or something like that is basically the same idea except 

464.71 465.85 A: you know twenty years later 

466.04 469.03 B: exactly and what's interesting too is that they uh 

474.32 474.80 A: yeah 

479.41 488.05 B: uh it's kind of difficult in the sense that you have a time limit and you get to press buttons on a telephone if you press them out of order you don't make it so it's very nervewracking but it 

483.72 484.48 A: oh 

488.25 489.09 B: y- you can 

490.57 493.99 B: you can learn something at the end of that show you may have learned something you didn't 

494.41 495.15 B: (( )) 

495.27 501.84 A: yeah yeah agreed agreed and and actually my daughters have told me that i should try out for it but i just never have so 

496.70 497.81 B: you know and and 

501.49 509.78 B: oh it's definitely worth it i mean it's interesting they ask you i can speak from experience only in that particular show there's a series of three questions that are increase in difficulty 

510.18 512.97 B: and what it is you have to put them in a particular order one through four 

519.76 521.61 B: and you got to get the the the sequence right 

521.85 522.24 A: hm mhm 

521.88 522.21 B: and 

533.45 534.53 B: you know find a way to make 'em 

533.56 536.97 A: yeah and you might you might yeah sure sure and it would be a kick if it happened 

537.07 537.73 B: oh go ahead 

537.91 539.79 B: i mean there's a chance to actually win money there 

537.96 538.34 A: yeah 

539.80 540.92 A: yeah 

540.44 544.61 B: you know eh on on on survivor and i just watch it and if anything 

544.73 552.34 B: and i (( )) have to make this a point uh uh if anything i actually uh when if i do catch a a few minutes of the show i end up having less faith 

552.60 555.74 B: in the human race as a whole because it seems as though the premise 

556.06 557.29 B: of those shows now 

557.54 558.45 B: is talking about 

558.58 562.08 B: how they do the other person in or how they connive them or how they 

562.41 563.31 B: or how they whatever 

563.59 569.07 A: as opposed to how they they thrive and make a uh a a work living area
