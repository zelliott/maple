320.63 321.52 B: but 

323.26 335.14 A: i mean i guess the main i don't know i guess the main things that you need is you know friendship compatibility and there's got to be love and passion in there too you definitely have to have that 

332.81 333.92 B: oh yeah 

334.87 336.28 B: definitely

412.89 416.09 B: um sorry about that i forgot where we were 

415.90 419.71 A: no we were just talking about you know cheating and things like that 

419.18 420.60 B: oh yeah 

420.13 427.10 A: well you know that brings up a really good point too i think trust is really important you have to be able to trust your partner 

426.70 427.92 B: yes 

427.44 430.55 A: to have any kind of relationship anyway you know 

431.38 434.78 B: [noise] i've been through that part too [laughter] [noise] 

432.88 434.01 A: yeah 

434.04 448.20 A: well i mean once you're t- i think with most people and i think this is definitely the case human nature is once you're cheated on you're always suspicious you know but eventually you know if you're with someone that you know you can trust you eventually get over it so 

441.61 442.83 B: mhm 

449.18 450.56 B: yeah i think so 

450.94 455.32 B: i kinda went through that with brian this trust thing that 

453.21 454.19 A: uh-huh 

456.46 458.94 B: 'cause he really doesn't stand up for me 

459.26 460.22 A: okay 

459.38 461.46 B: sometimes and 

461.78 465.18 B: it just seems like he should i always stand up for him 

463.30 464.25 A: right 

465.52 467.11 B: you know if i might say something 

468.75 471.23 B: disparaging i think is the word
