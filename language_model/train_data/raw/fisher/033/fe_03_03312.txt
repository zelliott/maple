24.23 25.35 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

25.76 35.17 A: oh ok yeah i i i think um that's a good qua- oh i don't know i i think um one of the qualities i look for um in 

35.25 36.81 A: a life partner 

37.19 39.45 A: is someone who is 

39.60 44.49 A: open so open minded open to learning new things um 

45.19 49.82 A: you know who who's not who's not a closed minded person i think i think open mindedness is a 

49.84 54.28 A: you know someone you can talk with and you know learn new thing with 

54.15 55.63 B: so acceptance 

55.30 57.54 A: right yeah mhm acceptance hm

57.69 58.56 A: yeah 

59.69 64.31 A: yeah i mean i'm i don't i don't think you know you have to you know uh 

64.78 70.21 A: be um i don't think you both have to agree on every single thing but you know um 

69.49 71.71 B: what [laughter] like you could [laughter] 

70.98 76.09 A: right so yeah i think that's yeah i think it you know acceptance and 

75.70 77.36 B: have you been married a long time 

77.30 78.19 A: huh 

77.83 79.55 B: have you been married a while 

79.44 84.78 A: yes well actually no not not not a long time for four years 

84.84 94.93 B: see i've been in one from seventeen years and i think [laughter] the reason i said forgiveness is because that if i couldn't forgive him all the time it would already be over [laughter] 

91.15 92.48 A: [laughter] 

95.71 96.68 B: (( you know )) 

96.40 98.40 A: mhm so uh 

97.60 102.30 B: but i i think it's important more to like your mate even than to love them [noise] 

102.03 104.86 A: oh i i you know what i i agree with you on that because 

104.93 108.61 A: i mean um you know some sometimes i mean um 

109.22 124.10 A: you know you you you do go through things where you know you have little you know disagreements and you know things like that and um yeah i i i i agree with that i i think it is important to to like to like your mate 

123.48 127.09 B: [noise] and to know that they'll stick by you when times are bad [noise] 

126.79 137.00 A: right i i absolutely i absolutely agree with that you know to know that yeah to know that somebody will be there uh for me it's because it's you know it's easy to be there when 

136.82 147.73 A: you know when things are going fine i mean that's the easy part but you know when times uh get tough and you know that's that's when i mean that's when you that's whenever uh a marriage 

138.60 139.76 B: yeah 

146.64 148.89 B: [noise] but you see if they've let you down 

148.94 150.21 B: and they do 

150.80 153.24 B: that's why you have to come up with the forgiveness 

152.79 154.26 A: mhm 

153.95 156.50 B: i figure they're just you know going through a weak 

157.36 161.61 B: that they're breakable too just 'cause he's a man doesn't mean he's immune to [noise] 

162.11 164.31 B: you know to breakage 

164.08 165.45 A: right 

164.90 168.43 B: 'cause i've just recently gone through a million changes and 

168.47 170.89 B: i found i went through most of them alone 

171.95 174.55 B: which is pretty surprising to me you know 

174.07 175.48 A: mhm 

176.93 177.83 B: so 

177.91 179.46 B: i'm trying to forgive him 

179.16 180.94 A: right 

180.73 183.29 B: but it's hard [laughter] 

182.91 184.00 A: and he wasn't 

183.43 188.15 B: i guess this is the part that they mean when they say you're working you have to work at a marriage [noise] 

187.49 190.35 A: right well i i mean i guess 

190.36 198.41 A: i guess you know when um when your partner's not not there like you thought they would be i guess that can sor- be sort of a let down i guess uh 

197.70 200.02 B: yeah like almost like a betrayal 

199.75 200.68 A: right 

201.40 202.38 B: (( you know )) 

203.19 206.66 B: like a soldier not going to the front [laughter] 

205.00 209.66 A: mhm yeah [laughter] yeah that's what it's a very good analogy 

209.73 210.65 A: (( hm )) 

210.65 214.45 B: so i but i agree with you on your points too you know 

215.13 218.86 B: willingness to be heard willingness to listen to the other one 

219.50 220.94 A: yeah because i 

220.06 223.71 B: but i've taken it offensively that's the hard part 

222.95 226.23 A: right oh yeah i mean and because um 

226.45 227.63 A: i mean uh 

228.20 231.51 A: i as you know when i was younger i learned some 

231.58 235.89 A: hard lessons with that myself i mean i used i used to be one of these people you know uh 

235.80 247.30 A: if i made a point i wanted the other person to agree with me and they had to be and when i was like you know became more mature got a little older i i see that saw that it didn't have to be that way you know i 

246.45 249.28 B: you have to be able to disagree without being disagreeable 

248.69 251.58 A: right exactly because if you know i 

251.47 266.06 A: mean i'm i'm uh thirty six years old now but in my i would say my early twenties i mean i wanted to you know be with a partner who thought along the same lines as i do you know well you know whether you know politically or all kinds of you know all issues you know i wanted to be 

266.11 277.21 A: you know her to be compatible politically and you know on social issues what it caused some um [laughter] tumultuous uh [laughter] times when i was younger 

276.89 280.18 B: yeah what do they mean about opposites attract do you know [laughter] 

279.38 281.60 A: right uh you know and um 

281.63 282.64 A: so 

282.75 286.32 A: you know i i i so i i've learned a lesson with that now you know me and 

286.18 296.18 A: wife now we don't i mean we have some differences on things yeah i mean there're a lot of things that we are compatible a lot of ideas and issues that we are compatible about but there are some things that we you know 

296.12 301.66 A: have uh disagreements on and it's not i mean to say it's not a bone of it's not a source of uh contentiousness 

301.83 304.11 B: do you always feel in love [sigh] 

305.66 307.03 A: (( do i always feel in love )) 

306.64 307.97 B: (( yes )) 

307.32 312.50 A: well i like i said i've been married for four years and yes i i i'm still in love 

314.00 314.74 B: (( mm you )) 

314.71 315.72 A: mhm 

315.15 317.79 B: see sometimes i question what i am doing 

318.10 319.17 A: excuse me 

318.99 323.56 B: sometimes i question myself about that 'cause i'm just what i'm doing 

320.61 321.87 A: right 

323.39 326.31 A: right well you say you've been married for seventeen years 

325.89 327.03 B: yeah 

326.37 337.21 A: okay see i've only been married for four so [laughter] i don't know how i'll be feeling in you know another in another eight or ten years yet [laughter] yeah 

332.38 335.00 B: you wonder if it's a if it's a habit 

336.38 337.37 B: (( you know )) 

337.61 338.30 B: (( [cough] )) 

338.42 339.70 B: because um 

340.05 342.16 B: everything i once loved isn't there 

343.42 344.83 A: right 

344.49 349.59 B: i'm sure he would say the same thing we both say to each other god you've both you've changed so much 

349.04 350.44 A: mhm 

349.97 354.10 B: [mn] and i say well for every action there's an opposite and equal reaction [noise] 

354.01 355.11 A: right 

355.43 357.06 A: i mean uh i'm 

357.37 364.73 A: because i'm i i i think i think i'm i'm sure with the vast majority of people i mean like when uh people 

365.26 368.87 A: two people first you know get married i mean i'm sure that they 

369.00 371.54 A: don't believe that [laughter] you know that 

371.66 374.32 A: down the road that you know that they're uh 

374.46 383.44 A: that they could ever you know fall out of love or that that that first you know uh that bliss honeymoon like bliss whatever 

382.93 385.06 B: yeah well that ended at the two year mark 

385.04 387.08 A: [laughter] the two year mark 

386.94 389.51 B: well the bliss part did don't you think 

389.54 390.75 A: (( well )) 

389.84 394.64 B: think if if you looked back then weren't you thinking about looking out for a marriage counselor at the two year mark 

394.73 396.91 B: because i think everybody does 

397.78 403.62 A: well i would i would say for myself i mean i would say for myself it's still there 

403.60 405.59 B: well maybe 'cause you got married later 

405.58 410.40 A: yeah that yeah that's maybe yeah that i mean that could have something to with it you know 

410.52 414.70 A: you know 'cause you know yeah i got married in my early uh early thirties 

415.85 418.48 B: well [laughter] i got married in my late thirties to this one 

418.15 419.53 A: oh okay 

419.58 423.02 B: in my late teens to the first one i was married for ten years 

422.52 424.03 A: right 

425.12 426.19 B: um 

427.17 430.11 B: [sigh] so what do you think do you think um 

432.65 434.93 B: do you think that uh maybe um 

435.65 437.74 B: compromise might be the 

438.06 439.43 B: the big deal 

439.63 441.04 B: to keep you together 

440.76 443.91 A: oh i i i believe definitely so i mean i think 

443.73 446.21 B: you think honesty's the best policy i don't 

447.27 449.18 A: well i think 

449.40 456.96 A: well i mean let me let me say this i think that uh it depends on what you're being honest [laughter] about i mean i think right i mean i i do believe 

454.10 455.20 B: yeah 

456.76 459.39 B: open communication versus confession 

459.23 460.09 A: huh 

460.34 462.89 B: open communication not confession 

462.34 470.39 A: right and yeah and i think it depends on what you're being honest about i mean i i do believe that most of the time honesty is a good policy but i do agree with you that there 

469.38 470.96 B: forthrightness 

470.45 480.83 A: right and i do agree with you that there are there are times where you know where honesty is not not called for and uh and other things that you know honesty doesn't necessarily mean truth 

480.90 481.93 A: you know 

481.43 482.80 B: there you go 

482.27 488.96 A: right it doesn't necessarily mean you can you can you can be honest about something but yet be completely wrong about it [laughter] so 

489.09 493.18 A: i agree with you i think there are times where honesty may not be called for 

489.38 490.35 B: yeah 

492.84 503.57 B: yeah and uh when i was a young wife i used to think oh you have to tell me everything the truth the truth the truth then i found out and then i couldn't unknow it and i couldn't [laughter] forget it 

502.95 515.60 A: yeah yeah so truth and honesty doesn't always they don't always go hand in hand i mean not not always so and i what and you're right i mean communica- open communication is the is the key i mean and i think as long as you're able to 

515.71 516.82 A: (( you know )) 

516.10 521.45 B: so i think maybe then to be to maintain a friendship probably would be the 

521.68 523.93 B: single most important thing 

523.70 525.12 A: mhm i agree 

524.41 525.88 B: in the 

525.97 529.01 B: survival of a longterm relationship 

528.71 532.33 A: right i well i agree i mean i think friendship is very important 

530.94 537.67 B: if that's possible because if you're friends with someone you won't hurt them you won't betray them you won't lie to them you won't let them down 

537.25 538.71 A: right 

538.47 540.58 B: you'll be honest with them and fair 

541.22 542.48 B: you'll listen 

541.57 544.08 A: mhm 

543.32 544.70 B: and be heard 

544.31 545.95 A: right i i agree 

545.35 547.08 B: without a lot of criticism 

546.68 548.75 A: i i agree 

548.80 551.26 A: uh i i i agree with you there i mean 

551.42 552.98 A: uh me 

552.19 555.00 B: though where do we learn that [laughter] [laughter] 

554.00 561.68 A: well [laughter] well i i guess you learn it through through life experiences um 

561.18 563.73 B: oh life experiences make you hate each other 

563.27 564.33 A: (( well )) 

563.77 567.47 B: [laughter] it's hard to be friendly when you're hating them 

568.34 571.26 B: [mn] and there's always something you know left to 

571.49 573.60 B: [noise] residual pain you know 

575.41 576.93 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

577.40 580.08 B: but i keep trying i really do 

580.48 581.74 B: not that uh 

582.06 583.67 B: it seems to be 

584.28 586.52 B: gaining me a lot of points but 

585.93 589.06 A: right well do you think he's still trying or 

589.13 590.65 B: no not at all 

590.36 591.60 A: right 

592.64 596.31 B: not at all it's almost like the exact opposite almost like he's got 

596.41 599.95 B: marriage suicide on the brain like [laughter] he'd do everything that he can
