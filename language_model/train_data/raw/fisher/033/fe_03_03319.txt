0.51 2.53 A: hello this is joshua 

2.63 4.61 B: hi my name is karen 

4.43 5.54 A: hi 

5.01 6.24 B: how are you 

5.96 7.69 A: good how are you doing 

7.04 8.94 B: oh very good thank you 

8.65 9.31 A: yeah 

9.48 11.04 A: interesting topic 

11.26 14.19 A: did you hear the whole um topic 

13.78 23.83 B: i believe so i think was it life partners and um [mn] what qualities you think are actually m- are makes them best suited for you is that correct or 

23.03 25.75 A: okay yeah that sounded like i heard 

25.17 36.85 B: okay 'cause i want want to make [laughter] sure we agree upon that we've got the right thing to discuss here [mn] um well to start i was going to say that any i have never participated in anything exactly like this so i was going to say i'm not sure um how to 

29.50 30.81 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

36.86 41.58 B: to necessarily proceed but um [laughter] i guess we'll just kind of go from there 

38.65 39.25 A: (( yeah )) 

40.59 42.03 A: (( um )) 

42.37 47.69 A: i did a couple of them i think you just generally talk about what you think about the 

47.75 49.64 A: topic so 

49.60 50.67 B: right 

50.60 56.21 B: well um let's see i i guess i i don't mind beginning [laughter] um i guess wh- 

54.24 55.34 A: sure 

56.05 66.05 B: first and foremost i guess basically though i think um i guess uh as far as life partners goes typically i uh honesty um is the kind of first foremost for me and having somebody who is 

65.98 71.61 B: um dependable and you know that i can rely upon and uh is a very honest individual 

71.65 72.74 A: mhm 

73.01 77.78 B: um i'm trying to think of what else i was going to say did you wanna comment on anything or 

76.85 78.46 A: (( mm um )) 

78.79 79.83 A: (( hm )) 

80.00 94.49 A: yeah i guess for me um whenever i think of something like a life partner that's different i'm just thinking about um any old romantic relationship you get into this is like something more serious that you want someone that 

94.67 107.74 A: you'd know all sides of them and someone that would you know keep you know being humorous and lighthearted and stuff um even in bad times i guess too 

96.66 98.49 B: correct right mm 

108.76 120.19 B: very good now i agree i think that's a good aspect and i think it's nice if you find somebody who is um some people obviously opposites attract and things i know for myself i think i need somebody who is a kindred spirit um 

120.18 127.21 B: who um shares a lot in common with me um i have actually been married before and and divorced and 

127.14 133.45 B: now about five years into dating somebody else since the divorce and so i am getting ready to be remarried again and 

133.25 134.01 A: (( yeah )) 

133.35 137.80 B: um i think you're very much more cautious after you've had that type of an experience and li- 

137.58 147.31 B: you know you really kind of uh narrow it down what you're actually looking for [sigh] and uh i think you know really finding someone who is a true life partner and or soulmate you know you're um 

147.15 159.64 B: [lipsmack] i i think i need somebody who really does keep me um entertained and um that we you know keeps me like you said laughing and is just a very a a good hearted person and just fun to be around and stuff that you enjoy 

159.58 164.71 B: um because i i know that you want to find someone that really um melds well with you so that 

164.60 174.84 B: you don't get um you know bored with the situation [laughter] or anything you know someone who that's really supportive and uh that you feel good about um having in your life day to day you know 

167.92 168.82 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

174.62 175.76 A: mhm 

175.81 178.52 A: yeah i so 

178.94 184.89 A: i mean i think it's really important to have a person be someone that's a good friend and everything too 

184.86 193.44 B: absolutely i agree and i know some people i i've uh witnessed or been party to relationships where they don't have that element and i think that's um 

185.09 186.65 A: (( and um )) 

193.44 201.25 B: that can be very problematic because if you don't respect one another and not regard and also appreciate one another as just friends it's um 

201.23 214.84 B: it's like i you know when you talk about boredom kind of ensuing you know people kind of constrain go their own ways and things like that i think as well and that's not having a lot really um to you know be in common and also be supportive of one another you know [cough] 

214.29 215.39 A: mhm 

215.98 217.34 A: yeah 

216.84 225.27 B: yeah [laughter] it's interesting to talk to a total stranger about something that's like very serious in nature you know 

217.72 218.81 A: [laughter] 

221.02 222.47 A: yeah 

224.44 229.26 A: it is yeah but it it is pretty common to everybody to think about 

225.71 226.71 B: um 

228.67 238.70 B: yeah absolutely well everybo- yeah it's an important issue that everyone at some point in their life has to ponder so it is interesting everyone has a certain opinion about it that's for sure you know [mn] 

236.64 237.63 A: yeah 

238.32 242.30 A: having experienced i guess a marriage before do you feel like 

242.38 249.29 A: there are things that you learned from that experience that you'll you've taken into this new situation mhm 

247.84 258.58 B: absolutely because i think that i um probably married um too suddenly and wasn't as careful as i might have been um i think situationally i think there were factors that presented themselves that 

258.57 271.65 B: um the person was in the military and there was a move and stuff that was going to be happening and i think i was a little bit not content with some factors in my own life and was looking for change and perhaps you know did things for the wrong reasons rather than it really being 

271.59 279.96 B: knowing this person inside and out and knowing that there was true love involved and that this person was a perfect or or close to it could be a good match for me 

279.75 291.18 B: and thinking about it in a lifetime um in those kind of uh uh perspective i don't think that i did that so i didn't have as much foresight and i think um hindsight's always twenty twenty and i think it's a lot clearer 

289.46 290.43 A: yeah 

290.95 297.71 B: and i think you are um a lot stricter to what you really want and need and are are um after you've had a 

297.53 307.27 B: an experience like that you know and uh but fortunate to find somebody that has fit into that bill of what i really thought and what's interesting about it is when i was unhappy during the marriage 

307.06 319.92 B: i would kind of think about what i would want you know as it started to kind of you know falter and so you kind of already have ideas of what you're looking for because you've kind of learned through just like you do with anything you learn through trial and error you know 

312.02 312.89 A: yeah 

319.67 321.06 A: mhm 

320.45 324.87 B: but yeah ha- have you ever been married or [sigh] no 

323.27 330.25 A: no um i've had i think the longest relationship i've had is about a year and nine months or so 

330.07 331.24 B: oh okay 

330.48 344.36 A: i haven't been in too many really long relationships but um it's it's strange like the thing i worry about is [laughter] sometimes worrying too much about looking for a life partner and not not enough for just 

344.40 346.17 A: looking for someone who 

346.36 352.38 A: you know i can be compatible with and have a good time with just for a short amount of time so i 

351.16 353.98 B: right so just for kind of the time being right 

352.78 358.30 A: yeah and my parents actually um got divorced around about ten and so 

358.36 369.43 A: i i feel like that experience of going through my parents' divorce has taught me to be extra critical about like who i am considering dating and stuff like that so 

367.53 368.38 B: oh 

368.73 377.39 B: absolutely and i can appreciate that 'cause i was going to say um which is funny that i would tell you that i felt like i rushed into things and was not as cautious as i might have been 

375.92 376.84 A: (( [laughter] )) 

377.13 378.06 A: yeah 

377.36 384.39 B: but it's funny because my parents are still married and they've been married for thirty odd years or close it's going to forty and so it's 

384.35 393.12 B: i always thought that i would be in that same situation as they were you know and so it's funny that i would end up being divorced and i was divorced after about five years of marriage so 

387.93 389.03 A: yeah 

393.05 395.81 B: i did it's strange too i felt like um 

395.61 410.01 B: [lipsmack] uh what's good is it's nice if you can be comfortable um being on your own too and then like you said extending that to just taking things day for day and kind of appreciating the person for whatever time that you do have with that person rather than 

409.82 420.41 B: it seems like at a certain point you get to where you're starting to kind of in you life where you start to kind of like you said seek out a life partner and you don't can't you know take it day for day and just to some degree you know 

416.36 417.22 A: yeah 

420.12 421.75 A: mhm [mn] yeah 

420.91 426.19 B: or just for what it is i guess you know [mn] but that's interesting how old are you 

423.35 424.69 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

426.16 427.66 A: i'm twenty three 

427.24 435.20 B: twenty three okay well see you're still young i was going to say i i'm not that much older than you but i'm i'm actually i'm i'm in my thirties i was going to say i'm thirty four so 

434.96 435.79 A: mhm 

435.12 449.26 B: it's just um it is different too you know i guess i'm not that but time you know is such a heavily spent time as far as people um begin to get married and start families and things and that that ten year spread between our ages you know 

448.90 452.40 A: yeah yeah so did you get married pretty young [mn] 

449.65 450.61 B: yeah 

451.59 459.45 B: yes i did i was actually i was actually uh one to two year older than you when i first got married yeah so it's it's um it's interesting [laughter] 

458.83 460.31 A: (( yeah [laughter] mhm )) 

459.68 463.94 B: yeah i wish i would have waited but you know i guess you can't um 

463.95 474.36 B: [mn] it always makes more sense after you've done it you can look back and see your mistakes you know so there's always you c- there's good things that come of the bad [laughter] but um 

471.74 473.25 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

474.15 481.86 A: are you a person that feels like there's only one life pert- partner out there for each person or that there are many yeah yeah yeah 

480.71 482.93 B: (( i don't know i mean i )) 

483.52 490.94 B: i i you know sometimes i would say that perhaps i might have thought that way but i don't know it seems interesting in that um 

491.64 499.73 B: i i think that i have probably met people that potentially had the timing or different elements of the uh if the whole situation thing had been right that perhaps 

499.66 506.10 B: there could be others out there so i d- i don't know and it's almost like people change so much as they go through their life 

505.89 516.45 B: individually that perhaps there are multiple partners for people over different stages in their life but i knows that goes against the whole sense of monogamy and finding that one person but 

516.39 526.05 B: i guess it just really depends it um to me i'm it's in a sense of like the individual and what you you know and how dramatically you change throughout your entire life you know 

521.15 523.26 A: (( um )) 

525.95 536.62 B: and what fits your needs but i think that i think there definitely is somebody out there for everybody and perhaps that some people could find more than one person that could fill that bill you know what about you how do you feel about that 

536.19 540.87 A: well [cough] well i think it's definitely important to 

540.88 542.31 A: um 

542.16 549.29 A: to be committed to someone that you really love and are really um compatible with um 

544.98 545.98 B: mhm 

549.15 561.69 A: i think that there are a lot of people out there that probably could be pretty compatible with each person i've just met so many different kinds of people from so many different places um 

562.04 575.08 A: [lipsmack] and different perspectives and stuff that it seems like there could be a lot of people out there for everybody it's just a matter of like running into them at the right time and sort of being open 

572.80 573.86 B: mhm 

575.03 577.50 A: to the possibility a lot so 

576.93 582.84 B: you know and i was just going to say too i think that like you know we were talking about the timing and stuff as well because there are people 

582.69 592.76 B: who perhaps you know they meet somebody and then they've already married somebody else and then they think you know had i still been single then they might have thought they would have been interested and you never know what would happen until 

591.02 591.82 A: (( i [mn] )) 

593.04 599.89 B: these people would obviously unite and to test things out but i think there are you know what we as we talked about the things sometimes are
