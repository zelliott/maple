64.71 66.93 B: oh good [laughter] cute

68.53 69.65 B: yeah 

69.08 74.50 A: um and for me i guess for a lifelong partner was somebody i think who was responsible 

74.26 75.20 B: yeah 

74.67 77.76 A: i didn't want some lazy bum who 

78.24 80.12 A: (( was just going to lay around all day )) 

79.62 82.90 B: yeah that's that's really important isn't it 

83.77 84.70 A: phone call 

85.32 86.77 A: so um 

87.04 90.83 A: other than that uh let's see uh honesty i think was another good one 

90.55 91.56 B: yeah 

93.08 95.34 B: yeah hard worker for sure 

95.19 96.77 A: yeah definitely 

96.10 97.88 B: yeah 

97.83 100.74 A: um somebody who's uh not abusive 

100.77 103.37 B: yes that's a real 

104.04 106.31 B: a real problem now too 

106.41 108.49 A: mm it it does seem to be for some 

108.24 109.22 B: yeah 

110.82 115.29 B: yeah um yeah no i can't think of anything else [laughter] offhand 

115.61 116.29 B: hm 

117.58 121.03 A: (( uh i think friendship has a lot to do with it you know i think )) 

119.60 122.70 B: yes i- yeah you have to be friends first 

122.35 126.68 A: right right because if you can't get along then there's no reason for it to go any further 

126.39 127.75 B: yeah 

129.22 135.99 B: and i think their their family how they were brought up meeting their family seeing you know 

129.59 130.26 A: (( n- )) 

136.58 137.55 B: (( the )) 

137.67 142.04 B: the ideals that their family were were raised with and 

141.45 142.03 A: (( [noise] )) 

142.71 146.34 B: that kind of gives you a good idea of what you got there too 

146.35 147.26 A: uh-huh 

147.68 149.35 A: yeah that's true that's true 

149.59 152.05 A: that's true let's see what else um 

152.84 159.36 A: let's see we've covered somebody who's a hard worker we covered somebody who's non abusive regardless if it's verbal or physical 

158.95 159.95 B: (( mhm [noise] yeah )) 

159.97 162.24 A: um friendship is a good one 

162.56 164.95 A: uh let's see what other 

164.99 169.16 A: you know to be honest with you my own my my husband asked me to go out on a date 

169.34 174.94 A: uh to go have a drink and i haven't been home from that drink since and it's been you know like i said thirteen years so 

174.36 175.77 B: well that's great [laughter] 

175.19 176.76 A: (( [laughter] yes )) 

177.17 180.86 A: [laughter] some would say it's slutty but hey it worked out for me 

180.30 181.86 B: (( that's great )) 

182.08 185.87 A: um let me see um let me see besides being honest 

185.74 186.59 B: (( how about )) 

185.94 192.16 A: uh i think a lot of things that break up a lot of re- of uh relationships is um the cheating 

192.01 193.17 B: yeah 

192.65 197.39 A: i think if people were honest about how they felt about other things 

196.52 197.56 B: right 

197.42 205.37 A: and like we have an open relationship so if one of us wa- wanted to sleep with someone else we would tell the other person first before we did it 

204.97 206.17 B: yeah 

205.56 210.71 A: that way you they're they're you've eliminated the cheat you've eliminated the lie 

208.78 209.60 B: right 

210.88 214.40 A: now all you can get a- mad about it really is the act itself 

214.68 215.47 B: yeah 

214.73 220.97 A: so it's and after you've invested that much time in a relationship is it really worse worth throwing it out the window 

220.62 221.56 B: (( right )) 

221.35 222.79 A: over a 

222.93 225.00 A: a something that happened in the heat of passion 

224.95 226.39 B: yeah 

225.94 226.74 A: so 

226.87 228.88 B: yep that's true no no 

226.89 228.30 A: (( i don't think it is )) 

228.40 230.14 A: yeah you know so 

231.22 232.73 B: and somebody who's fun 

231.57 232.74 A: (( and )) 

233.09 234.46 A: oh definitely 

234.13 234.98 B: yeah 

234.47 241.54 A: uh likes to do things somebody who stays home all the time is boring unless that's your type if you if you're a hermit crab type then that works out for you 

241.35 242.12 B: yeah 

242.07 246.41 A: but not me i'm i'm spontaneous i like to continuously go places you know 

247.57 248.28 A: so 

248.19 249.49 B: good 

249.26 252.20 A: a good hu- a a good sense of humor i think 

251.64 252.63 B: yes 

252.48 254.47 A: helps too yeah 

254.00 259.75 B: yes my husband's a tease he teases everyone teases the kids [laughter] 

257.17 258.29 A: oh [laughter] 

259.36 260.96 A: that's good though 

260.42 261.76 B: yeah 

261.35 265.02 A: i i think that it makes uh life a lot more um 

265.35 272.62 A: spon- spontaneous although i can see i could see in situations where it could become an irritation though if you were trying to be serious [laughter] 

266.67 267.53 B: yeah 

269.72 271.16 B: (( [laughter] yeah no it's )) 

271.76 277.77 B: it's it's okay he knows when to when to quit and when yeah [laughter] yeah [laughter] um [lipsmack] let's see [lipsmack] yeah 

275.08 276.97 A: when to lay off that's good good 

277.89 278.58 A: (( [laughter] )) 

282.43 284.05 A: lifes and partnerships 

284.56 291.13 A: well at least at least they got two people that have been married for a while talking about it anyway instead of somebody who's just been married for a year or something 

290.80 294.61 B: [sigh] yeah they it's [laughter] they don't really have a clue do they and 

293.77 294.35 A: (( [noise] )) 

294.71 295.89 A: no not really 

294.82 298.80 B: i think it changes so much when you bring kids into it too 

298.84 300.56 A: oh yeah all of a sudden now 

299.40 302.81 B: so you'll really notice that if you guys were alone for that long 

302.86 304.62 B: before you had kids 

304.51 315.14 A: yeah yeah it w- all of a sudden y- you can't get up and go w- uh where you want to go when you want to go because now you're dragging a baby and you're thinking oh i can't take the child in because it's an adult place 

309.76 310.74 B: yeah 

314.51 315.82 B: yeah 

315.32 318.19 A: and then the babysitter pr- now that becomes a problem 

318.56 321.19 A: i'm real picky about who i leave my children with 

319.78 320.34 B: (( [sigh] )) 

320.69 322.09 B: (( [noise] yes )) 

322.47 323.29 A: so 

322.99 337.45 B: yeah it really changes your whole and having to share too you know share yourself with someone else that uh it seems to be that a lot of of relationships have [noise] trouble with that when they have kids [noise] 

330.43 331.98 A: [noise] 

335.84 336.96 A: um 

337.10 338.64 A: b- between 

338.73 340.63 A: my husband and my son yes 

340.55 341.37 B: yeah 

340.86 342.83 A: they they fight for my attention 

342.69 343.95 B: yeah 

343.42 344.39 A: (( you know )) 

344.43 347.57 A: um other than that i i don't find too much 

347.86 351.66 A: m- my son he's just he's real clingy anyway i think little boys are 

351.41 352.50 B: yeah 

352.05 359.86 A: they're uh they always want their mother constantly so i don't think that my son's any different than any other child out there it's just him being an only child 

359.82 360.73 B: yeah 

360.14 367.94 A: on top of it probably a- adds a little bit more to the situation because he's not used to oh go play you know what am i going to go play with 

366.28 367.08 B: right 

367.33 368.64 B: yeah exactly 

367.99 369.76 A: (( [laughter] you know )) 

369.24 370.27 B: [laughter] 

371.97 378.80 A: [noise] now let's see you said you had what three kids and you've been married for fif- yeah oh three girls oh that's fun 

374.81 376.35 B: yeah yeah three girls 

377.64 378.38 B: yeah 

378.52 379.30 B: yeah 

379.44 384.56 A: um so you both are praying that one day one of 'em does not come home and say gee mom i'm pregnant 

383.99 386.28 B: exactly [laughter] 

385.33 388.14 A: [laughter] 

387.71 389.18 B: yeah 

389.09 390.46 A: [laughter] 

389.31 390.53 B: that's uh 

390.95 396.19 B: boys sure we're not at the boyfriend age yet because the oldest is thirteen so 

395.56 396.89 A: oh soon 

396.22 397.52 B: i can um 

398.17 404.91 B: that would be another thing [laughter] about p- choosing a life partner my husband is not going to do well with older 

402.18 403.59 A: yeah 

405.43 408.47 B: [sigh] teenage girls so it's going to be [sigh] 

408.51 411.95 B: interesting phase of our relationship too 

408.63 409.99 A: right 

412.02 419.12 A: yeah i i can see that well i mean fathers are very overly protective of their daughters yeah so i can see where that one's going 

419.36 428.07 A: to be yeah i think you'll go through it okay i think i think the first one will will will break him down [laughter] then the other two will not have a problem at all 

424.36 425.37 B: (( yeah yeah it will )) 

427.27 430.13 B: (( be yeah [laughter] that poor first one [laughter] )) 

429.09 434.29 A: [laughter] 

431.76 433.15 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

435.63 438.40 B: mm i can't think of anything else 

436.34 436.91 A: (( [noise] )) 

438.12 442.36 A: yeah well there's there's gotta be things that keep us together i think um 

442.40 444.62 A: when you go through hard times together 

444.82 447.37 A: it makes your relationship a lot stronger 

447.58 456.38 A: when you do get to f- you know when the good times do there and that's probably what makes your relationship so good after all them years is knowing that you've made it through all them hard times together 

456.53 462.23 A: and after going through all that you know that you're going to stick together and continue to to fight the world 

462.51 465.98 A: you know just the two of you against the world and make it work 

465.14 471.85 B: yeah mm mm oh definitely i had um the past year i was sick and ended up having a a tumor in my head 

471.87 472.56 A: mm 

472.07 482.31 B: and had to travel like four hours on an airplane to get surgery and the whole thing and i never thought of my husband as 'cause i'm kind of the stronger one in the relationship and 

481.80 482.61 A: uh-huh 

482.27 496.14 B: and i never thought that he would be able to support me w- w- in that i what i needed if something like that ever happened i thought he'd be oh n- you know like a mess and he was just awesome he was just 

488.50 489.38 A: right 

492.67 493.70 A: mhm 

496.07 498.52 B: he surprised me he was uh 

497.63 498.43 A: right 

498.56 501.42 B: very very strong for me and my kids and 

501.46 505.16 B: and uh so even after fifteen years they can you know 

505.15 507.01 A: yeah yeah 

505.34 507.92 B: (( there i- there is always a surprise [laughter] it's )) 

507.77 517.21 A: but that's good though you know i mean it it could have been worse he could have laid down and been you know been real wimpy about it and not dealt with it very well and you could have constant problems 

508.72 509.59 B: amaz- 

512.49 513.30 B: yeah 

516.50 517.86 B: (( yeah )) 

517.64 525.14 A: so yeah th- that's that's a definite plus i think somebody who's strong enough to be able to hold everything on their shoulders when the time is needed 

522.73 523.45 B: yeah 

524.69 535.16 B: yeah when there when it's necessary 'cause i don't mind being the strong one in our relationship that's the way i am and that's the way he's not but he came through when i needed him to be that way so 

535.02 535.98 A: [noise] 

535.58 537.26 B: so that's good 

536.87 539.11 A: that's awesome that's most awesome 

540.62 542.16 B: yeah 

542.17 542.87 A: (( let's )) 

543.11 543.80 A: (( see )) 

544.58 546.65 A: life partners or relationships 

548.04 552.88 A: i don't know and that's weird because it's been so long since i've had to get out there and look for something 

552.64 553.95 B: mhm 

553.32 557.11 A: that i'm thankful that i don't have to go through that all over again 

557.46 558.24 B: (( yes )) 

557.64 560.13 A: and i won't i won't go through it again actually 

559.86 560.99 B: i know 

560.14 560.84 A: (( i )) 

561.19 564.37 A: i promised myself when i got married i'd get married once and one time only 

564.06 565.08 B: yeah 

564.80 571.46 A: and i picked that person and if he leaves me then that's it i guess i'm going to be on my own but i'm not going to go through it again 

569.40 570.33 B: yeah 

571.45 576.40 B: we have friends that have been married for about fifteen years that are going through a divorce right now and and uh my 

576.24 577.00 A: (( yes )) 

577.46 580.86 B: husband and i were just talking about that like going through that whole 

580.45 582.15 A: [noise] 

581.45 587.52 B: the whole dating and and trying to find oh i can't imagine going through that again 

583.49 584.86 A: mhm 

587.21 599.95 A: yeah the aspects of things that you're looking for again in a life partner you know and it's not really what you're looking for it's whether you two are compatible or not to actually make it work you know they say that you look for certain things in people i don't see i don't 

590.81 591.84 B: (( exactly yeah )) 

594.62 595.56 B: yeah
