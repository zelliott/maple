17.67 22.01 B: oh i see well very pleased to meet you so the topic is life partners 

19.83 20.67 A: nice 

21.60 22.83 A: right 

22.19 23.46 B: do you have one 

23.41 25.61 A: um my husband yes 

25.41 26.72 B: mhm 

25.97 27.43 A: i sure do 

27.05 31.63 B: and what do you think was the most important thing in uh choosing a husband 

31.22 42.30 A: i think um the most important thing uh i think was probably how he felt like about my children i have children 

42.18 43.12 B: i see 

43.31 49.84 A: and um i think that's uh really important about how they get along with your children and how 

49.85 56.08 A: your children get along with them especially after they come from different marriages or so 

56.24 68.65 B: [lipsmack] yeah i can see how that would be important because you all have to be compatible and and uh you know it's it would be very difficult for you if uh [lipsmack] if you had to make a choice 

60.65 62.06 A: exactly 

66.73 67.62 A: mhm 

68.78 75.62 A: yeah 'cause i have a um i have a son and he has downs syndrome so it's um 

75.84 79.19 A: it's kinda you know not everybody just wants 

79.23 84.92 A: every i guess man or woman or and anybody could really handle that you know 

84.62 85.65 B: mhm 

85.79 88.33 A: so what about you do you have a life partner 

87.87 91.40 B: i don't right now [laughter] i'm looking 

89.51 90.92 A: [laughter] 

91.85 96.95 A: so what do you think is like the most important thing about looking for one 

96.85 102.29 B: um i would say compatibility um you know you don't wanna spend your life 

102.35 111.53 B: uh at odds with somebody um it's certainly fine to be different you know you don't have to like the same things but you do have to be respectful and compatible 

104.75 105.90 A: yeah 

111.75 123.74 B: um respectful i think is is a big one as well you know um if if if somebody just just for example if somebody doesn't share your taste in music but you know you you love them dearly 

114.87 116.67 A: [mn] i agree 

123.65 137.68 B: you know you have to be able to take that sort of thing along with everything else [laughter] so you know to to respect that okay this is this is a thing that you like i don't necessarily like it but um you know that's fine that you do 

127.39 130.45 A: [mn] yes i agree very much mhm 

138.43 142.52 B: um and and also respecting other people as well like if uh [lipsmack] 

142.73 147.94 B: if i met somebody and and uh he and i got along famously but uh 

148.07 150.66 B: [lipsmack] oh let's say they were uh 

151.60 153.49 B: they were racist let's say 

153.23 154.30 A: yeah 

153.61 161.13 B: you know but but outside of that we got along i i wouldn't be able to handle that there's there's a line that i would draw you know that uh 

160.55 161.92 A: mhm 

161.28 170.09 B: you know there's certain things i cannot be respectful of so uh so i guess that goes with the compatibility part you really have to to jive and mess with each other 

164.01 165.15 A: that's 

170.33 171.49 B: certainly 

170.36 174.47 A: i think trust is a a big thing too don't you 

174.33 175.30 B: trust 

174.98 176.13 A: yes 

175.48 184.96 B: yes for sure for sure i know i've i've had uh past boyfriends that it's just it was always uh an inner struggle with myself 

184.50 185.69 A: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

185.05 186.07 B: um 

186.30 195.13 B: trying not to check up on them all the time because i just didn't know you know it it was just little things you know um 

190.05 191.39 A: mhm 

194.02 195.63 A: yeah 

195.17 202.17 B: are are they really going out with their friends or what are they doing you know just because they fostered a an environment where i didn't just them [lipsmack] 

201.72 202.86 A: mhm 

202.42 207.19 B: um because some things had happened where i had caught them in lies and things so 

207.34 212.72 A: i think that's real important too 'cause me and my husband we've been together for about 

212.74 215.09 A: like five years but 

214.94 227.11 A: we're really not jealous of each other and and we know like when we go out or something he'll like be with his friends and i'll be like over there with my friends or something 

226.96 231.05 A: we don't have to really be like joined i think it's good to be 

231.03 234.31 A: like that too so we're not both you know 

234.23 248.56 A: so jealous of one another where we can't like say oh well go over there you know and i may not feel like going like to our friends and partying that night but he may want to so i'm like go ahead go ahead 

244.79 245.65 B: mhm 

247.95 251.29 B: yes yeah that would be nice [laughter] 

250.97 252.22 A: (( [laughter] yes )) 

251.89 266.68 B: yeah i'm uh i'm hoping to find somebody to be a life partner i certainly i i've had um [lipsmack] like people in my family a lotta people in my family have had very long term marriages and i've i've seen a lot of healthy relationships and i know what it takes to uh 

266.55 267.59 A: (( yeah )) 

266.86 270.07 B: to commit to somebody for for life but uh 

270.06 271.06 A: mhm 

270.35 273.94 B: occasionally you know you just get to a point where you can't 

274.21 278.14 B: easily meet somebody so [laughter] that's where i'm at you know so 

276.22 277.51 A: i know 

277.95 283.27 A: you know i met my current husband now on a date line here [laughter] 

282.36 295.29 B: did you i i used to work with somebody who had uh gotten together with somebody that way and and i think in the past it was discounted a lot but but now when it's so hard for people to meet that 

295.40 303.31 B: you know online or or telephone chat lines things like that i think that you know that's uh a very good way to meet people now 

296.12 297.16 A: mhm 

301.27 302.54 A: (( exactly )) 

303.36 309.41 A: i think it is too it was good for me because i really couldn't go out because of my son and and 

308.36 309.32 B: mhm 

309.35 312.39 A: everything like that and then you know you 

312.33 319.59 A: and then i got on there as like a joke you know like a [laughter] well okay i'll just get on here and whiz in blah 

319.42 324.13 A: blah blah but i was real safe too 'cause i didn't you know b- 

323.91 334.64 A: a lotta people would leave me a message my box would be stuffed and you know i didn't really i didn't say anything that was like horrible i just said well you know i'm 

334.69 348.23 A: blah blah blah what i look like and then i just said and i like you know football wrestling and you know nascar and and motorcycles and stuff and then all of a sudden it would just be flooded with stuff and then 

347.43 348.04 B: (( [laughter] )) 

348.30 356.77 A: [laughter] and then i would screen them i mean because you can't never be too careful about [laughter] 

355.07 358.06 B: for sure yeah because you don't know you know like uh 

356.91 359.36 A: (( exactly )) 

358.37 367.16 B: i think to to some extent people generally judge people by appearance and when that part's taken away you have to judge them on what they're saying to you 

366.74 368.08 A: mhm 

367.32 370.39 B: you know so you have to to screen them somehow [laughter] 

370.53 375.80 A: i know and we talked for like two hours and i felt really comfortable with him 

375.78 388.96 A: and at ease he didn't make me feel like you know he was he sounded like a person that i really wanted to get to know so i met him over there and i mean god took a lotta trust [laughter] 

388.62 389.87 B: i bet 

390.56 398.93 B: yeah but i mean meeting face to face you know it it takes a lotta t- trust as well it takes a lotta guts and you really have to put yourself on the line even if 

393.04 394.17 A: mhm 

399.05 412.03 B: you know well any any kind of a relationship you know you're you're giving of yourself and you put yourself on on the line and you you know it may work out or you may get hurt you have to have to take the chance and uh yeah 

401.70 402.89 A: mhm 

403.63 405.30 A: exactly 

412.00 420.04 B: as long as you're uh aware of your safety i guess would be uh one thing that i've heard a lot of people you know try to meet in a public place 

412.10 413.32 A: i know 

419.58 421.04 A: (( yeah )) 

420.42 423.61 B: first first meeting you know a coffee shop or something 

423.42 429.19 A: 'cause i was married for a long time before and i mean i really you know 

429.03 441.18 A: it was kinda hard to break up and then be single for a little while you know and at first it's kinda like oh i can do this or i don't have to wash the dishes when i [laughter] 

441.20 444.97 A: when he wants me to i can just leave 'em there 

444.28 446.16 B: [laughter] yeah 

446.53 453.86 A: and then it's like then after a while it's like you know all your friends are married or have boyfriends and you're like 

453.67 464.94 A: okay well come on and then they try to set you up but i mean and then they try to set you up with people of course that you're not compatible with or i'm really tall so 

464.73 475.28 B: mm yeah but i mean your friends' hearts are in the right place they just wanna see you happy and they try to set you up and yeah i know often it doesn't work [laughter] uh i'm like that too you know if i see somebody that 

470.21 471.38 A: mhm 

475.05 483.09 B: that i know is maybe not right for me i think of a friend you know it's like well you know they're they're a nice guy but not for me but maybe so and so will like them [laughter] 

482.92 490.18 A: do you think looks are important though 'cause i i do i mean people say that they don't but i i do think so 

488.94 491.81 B: i do too i think that um 

491.26 492.25 A: [laughter] 

491.83 496.42 B: that that's something that i wouldn't be able to get past um the the way i feel 

496.05 497.25 A: mhm 

496.49 499.34 B: is that uh if 

499.59 503.11 B: if they're gorgeous and i fall in love with them for who they are 

500.85 501.67 A: mhm 

502.80 504.05 A: mhm 

503.19 511.40 B: and then afterwards something happened like their face got burnt or something that would be fine because i love them for who they are but i 

506.14 508.00 A: exactly 

509.69 510.74 A: mhm 

511.80 517.34 B: call me shallow but i need i need to have a physical attraction there first 

516.69 526.66 A: i agree so much because i mean that's i mean that's what you go on is first impression so if you see a person and you know he's like 

518.05 519.18 B: you know it's 

526.69 530.35 A: fat and bald and he doesn't take care of himself you're like 

530.79 532.82 A: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

531.34 543.06 B: exactly 'cause they might have health problems or like you say they don't care of themselves so they don't don't hold themselves in high esteem or anything and i think that's all very important how somebody treats themselves you know if they're 

534.05 535.70 A: mhm 

542.91 557.61 B: i mean they they don't have to be a model but they do have to be attractive to me and attractive to me might not be the same as attractive to you you know like there's people that we see in magazines all the time on the front cover and friends of mine go oh isn't he gorgeous and i think well not really 

549.82 550.87 A: right 

557.48 560.09 A: mhm mhm and do you know what 

558.14 563.52 B: [laughter] i'm more of a ragged outdoorsy kinda bearded guy type you know 

563.11 575.36 A: that's how i am too i mean i really i like long hair too now and all guys now they have like short hair but my husband had short hair and he's the first person i ever 

564.59 566.15 B: yeah [laughter] 

575.42 585.29 A: really liked that had like short you know short hair was more like business looking and stuff like that mostly i like the 

585.33 590.01 A: outdoorsy kinda you know long hair kinda little 

590.34 594.63 A: not rough looking but you know the [laughter] 

593.17 599.89 B: yeah i i think i know what you mean but you see like um like weight lifters or things like that they do not appeal me and and most 

598.81 599.95 A: me either
