106.79 108.87 B: okay so what do you look for 

109.50 119.95 A: well i actually already have one i already have a life partner i think pretty pretty sure so [laughter] i i it really is just a description then of my current partner yeah 

112.89 113.74 B: really 

114.66 115.64 B: (( [laughter] )) 

120.76 122.42 B: well what would that be then 

123.22 124.62 A: oh um

140.23 142.16 B: (( yeah )) 

141.06 143.14 A: (( [laughter] so amusing uh )) 

144.41 145.61 A: generous 

147.16 148.95 A: (( um understanding i suppose )) 

149.15 151.56 A: (( things of of that sort )) 

151.41 153.32 B: yeah 

153.39 156.08 A: somebody who i enjoyed spending a lot of time with who i'm comfortable 

158.57 161.42 B: yeah i would agree with that 

161.53 164.31 B: i think those would be good qualities in a life partner 

164.17 165.48 A: (( with hm sure )) 

165.65 170.47 B: i'm only sixteen so it's not something i'm really thinking about too much all the time right now 

170.64 172.35 A: [laughter] f- fair 

172.63 175.69 A: enough this is this is something that y- uh [laughter] 

173.45 175.19 B: (( yeah )) 

177.16 178.94 A: yeah i can 

179.80 181.26 B: (( yeah )) 

180.48 189.30 A: i can completely understand [laughter] 'cause i if recall when i was sixteen no that [laughter] sort of thing was not on my mind whatsoever 

187.71 188.86 B: yeah 

189.60 201.20 B: well it's still what i look for in any kind of romantic partner are those kind of qualities i think that's what everyone looks for [mn] unless they've got a lot of baggage and wanna be like you know 

196.38 197.24 A: (( yeah )) 

201.91 211.37 B: not treated too well just 'cause that's what they're used to but i think that's like the general things that like people look for in each other 

205.61 206.47 A: sure 

210.63 220.85 A: yeah yeah yeah i think i think uh there's even similar i mean you can put i can even put it more specifically it's also imagining you know like 

220.76 225.82 A: what would happen in sort of really adverse conditions as well or just 

223.72 225.37 B: (( right )) 

225.88 232.29 A: (( you know imagining for example having a family whether the person will have the capacity to be cruel and i and i think )) 

233.55 236.60 A: i'm i'm very certain actually that my current partner 

235.73 238.11 B: what's that 

237.12 239.57 A: doesn't have the capacity to be cruel 

239.54 243.73 B: yeah well i think everyone has the capacity to be cruel 

240.69 241.57 A: (( uh )) 

244.16 246.68 B: but not like 

247.07 258.35 B: uh i think everyone has the c- i think everyone is cruel to another person at one point maybe not with like completely malicious intentions but either way 

258.26 259.31 A: sure 

259.40 260.52 A: yes 

261.64 262.53 A: yeah 

261.87 272.64 B: so you have to take all that for granted it's like look for someone that you're able to deal with it like over a long period of time 

271.43 272.97 A: (( mhm mm )) 

273.89 279.20 B: which is a pretty like bleak way of looking at it if you're just say looking for someone that you can like deal with i suppose 

279.73 280.46 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

279.74 283.56 B: that's what it comes down to sometimes i've found 

283.03 285.11 A: right right 

286.78 292.98 A: yeah no it's the you know tha- that theme of cruelty at least is is uh 

293.71 298.18 A: well may be it's capacity you're quite right it's not the right way to put it but somebody who is 

298.86 302.80 A: uh extremely wary of of uh being that way 

302.60 304.78 B: yeah yeah 

303.30 306.81 A: yeah takes great pains to avoid 

309.88 312.82 A: but i think the thing that sold me at least on my on on 

313.75 320.16 A: my partner is uh every time she walks into a room she makes virtually everybody in the room sort of light up 

320.02 321.00 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

320.63 323.15 A: with uh with with um 

323.80 324.54 A: (( you know )) 

325.11 331.00 A: pleasure at seeing her that's uh i mean it sort of affects me certainly it affects me that way certainly 

330.55 331.49 B: uh-huh 

331.34 333.55 A: it's really uh also a pleasure to see 

333.22 335.17 B: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

333.75 336.84 A: just how she engages all all all manner of people 

338.23 341.63 B: yeah that's always like a good quality in someone 

341.67 342.47 B: that's 

342.85 347.17 B: one of those universal things that i think most people also look for 

346.34 347.99 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

351.34 357.56 A: uh well if it's not something that you think about too often we shouldn't talk about it we should talk about something else 

357.43 359.93 B: uh what do you want to talk about 

358.08 358.93 A: [laughter] 

358.95 364.23 A: [laughter] so well tell me if you're sixteen uh uh ha- 

364.90 370.97 A: i don't even think i had heard about linguistics at the age of sixteen i wasn't even remotely aware of it [mn] 

370.16 372.95 B: it really really interests me like 

373.05 379.58 B: ever since i've liked it um in german class when i was like fourteen i was n- then just like linguistics 

379.42 380.20 A: right 

379.58 391.40 B: like really interests me and um reading about noam chomsky his like h- what he has done for linguistics and it's like the whole idea that linguistics is like all hard wired for language 

383.41 384.13 A: uh-huh 

391.02 392.19 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

391.48 394.79 B: and it's present structure and all these things are like 

394.84 403.70 B: we're born with it and it's not like lang- individual languages are learned but yet like language is just like human nature and like 

402.79 403.67 A: sure 

403.74 406.37 B: thinking about how linguistics like 

406.93 415.63 B: if you can understand language and language is ingrained in your brain you can understand the way the human mind works and that is really interesting to me and like 

416.06 418.14 B: i don't know like i'll read 

418.39 426.87 B: like really dry documents online about like a way a really obscure language is like spoken just 'cause it's interesting for some reason 

427.32 431.43 A: i i completely understand [laughter] i do it every day [laughter] 

429.22 430.07 B: yeah 

430.57 431.51 B: (( mhm )) 

432.05 433.78 A: [laughter] yeah 

433.02 434.61 B: what do you do for a living 

434.67 437.66 A: i'm i'm a graduate student in linguistics actually 

437.20 438.50 B: oh really 

437.90 439.55 A: yeah yeah 

438.94 440.19 B: that's cool 

439.91 441.66 A: at santa cruz 

441.82 443.17 A: yeah

456.59 460.71 A: no i i'm i'm a graduate student i'm a phd student 

460.16 468.93 B: right so i'm not really clear how that you make a living with having that kind of degree what do you do to get like the money 

460.85 462.50 A: yeah so 

468.52 473.25 A: do you mean how am i funded right now or once once i graduate

474.99 484.73 A: yeah i i'm still a student and and i'm funded by the by the university uh typ- typically in exchange for the funding like tuition waivers and a 

479.34 480.60 B: (( oh )) 

484.28 485.17 B: uh-huh 

484.92 487.80 A: a stipend you know like monthly 

488.74 494.57 A: [sigh] they put money in my account to the tune of about eleven hundred dollars a month [laughter] not a lot of money but uh 

492.38 493.57 B: (( mhm )) 

494.26 496.24 B: yeah

514.23 515.10 B: uh-huh 

514.89 518.14 A: that that's a typical arrangement at least in graduate school 

518.74 522.99 B: yeah i don't know that much about higher education i go to a community college right now 

522.78 525.72 A: right right are are you are you um

533.15 534.34 A: yeah 

533.87 538.85 B: yeah it's something that i've thought about going into just 'cause it's something that interests me so much

539.02 543.64 B: but it just doesn't seem like 

545.14 550.76 A: [laughter] like a career move [laughter] [laughter]

576.17 577.05 A: sure 

576.37 582.01 B: but it's not like i don't know it's a long ways off so i'm not really thinking about it um right now
