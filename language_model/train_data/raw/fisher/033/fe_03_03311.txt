23.02 26.48 B: i guess just the normal things like um you

27.75 29.12 A: (( [laughter] )) 

29.26 31.25 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

29.57 32.37 B: responsible you know just the normal things 

32.64 36.38 A: oh yeah somebody who respects you and 

38.28 44.98 A: and you know somebody who will be there for you whenever you need them 

46.92 48.00 B: (( yeah yeah so um )) 

46.92 48.80 A: (( and )) 

48.68 51.00 B: um so you're married 

50.94 55.08 A: [noise] uh no i'm getting married in august i have been married before and 

52.96 54.03 B: oh really 

55.55 60.91 A: that was not somebody that was a life mate [laughter] no no no 

58.06 59.33 B: not a life mate 

61.03 61.91 B: (( no oh )) 

62.72 68.54 B: yeah it's um i haven't been married so i guess i haven't found the qualities of the person that i'm looking for 

68.61 72.19 A: yeah it's taken me a while i've 

72.13 85.45 A: been like i said i've been married once before and i don't know it's really weird with her it was more of what can you do for me not what we can do for each other type thing and the gal i'm with now um 

85.71 97.84 A: i mean sh- she's it's just unbelievable she has every quality that i've looked for in a life mate she respects me i respect her we talk about everything and 

96.81 97.93 B: mhm 

98.48 101.47 B: more like a friend i guess would be a good quality 

98.68 99.55 A: (( [noise] )) 

100.86 104.39 A: yeah exactly she's like one of my best friends 

104.22 105.94 B: yeah 

106.87 110.14 B: so i guess that would be a good quality in a life partner 

108.53 109.09 A: (( [noise] )) 

109.51 111.65 A: yeah it is 

111.69 116.33 A: it is i mean 'cause if you're not friends with them you can't discuss things with them you know it's 

116.56 118.78 A: if you're just in it just for 

119.39 123.64 A: i don't know just 'cause you don't want to be alone then it's not worth it 

122.71 124.56 B: yeah 

123.89 127.56 A: i guess another quality would have to be that um 

128.83 134.93 A: you know that oh i don't know they can deal with every aspect of your attitude [laughter] 

134.78 137.52 B: [laughter] or you their's [laughter] 

135.33 136.91 A: (( er )) 

137.14 138.47 A: yeah 

137.86 139.82 B: [laughter] 

139.95 148.83 A: 'cause sometimes they get frustrated at things and i mean i don't fly off the handle and abuse anybody but i can say a few choice words when i'm angry 

148.49 149.76 B: oh 

149.85 163.26 A: not to my fiancee but i can get a look on my face and start getting a little angry and she deals with it and calms me down just saying hey look and same for her she's you know 

164.39 170.96 A: we both have i wouldn't say an anger problem but short tempers i guess [laughter] 

168.96 170.81 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

171.26 172.77 B: (( nah um )) 

173.19 180.17 B: i know uh my friend just got married in november and they were actually my roommates for um 

176.17 177.27 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

180.46 183.92 B: three months while their house was being finished so that uh [sigh] 

182.37 183.40 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

184.39 194.96 B: i kind of helped them sometimes you know i'd get stuck in the middle of their um problems and sort of that's i think another quality would be somebody that communicates 

194.50 197.94 A: yes communication communication is a big key 

197.82 206.09 B: yeah that's what i tell them mainly the guy talks to me because i'm i've been friends with his now wife for like seven or eight years 

206.18 213.84 B: so he'll come to me and i hate getting in you know but i never say anything to her and then i just kind of he just needs somebody to talk to and 

213.89 227.92 B: um [cough] i never make any bad like um you know like say anything like oh she she should be doing this or whatever you know 'cause she's my friend but i just tell him mainly it's like he needs to communicate more than 

218.01 221.33 A: yeah 

223.18 226.35 A: (( yeah )) 

228.06 236.82 A: oh yeah i mean and and the thing is as you can't go to and him coming to you in a way sometimes it can be good but in a way sometimes it can be bad 

236.33 237.46 B: i know 

236.75 243.26 A: just for the simple fact is i mean if he's got a problem with her he needs to talk to her not somebody else 

241.68 242.73 B: i know 

242.97 246.22 B: that's what i tell him but he just um 

246.27 256.38 B: you know i tell them you know as newlyweds you're going to have things to work out and just like i've just got a roommate and it's just kind of similar you know it's a relationship in that um 

248.36 249.70 A: (( [sigh] )) 

255.33 260.01 A: yeah [laughter] 

256.54 263.24 B: not a life partner hopefully [laughter] 'cause hopefully he'll want to move on to his own place soon but um 

261.56 263.47 A: yeah 

263.28 266.50 B: it's similar where you have to kind of look it's you know 

266.54 268.73 B: there's nobody's perfect so 

268.40 281.59 A: oh exactly well see and with him discussing stuff with you too in a way could be good 'cause i mean he can like you know i have a best friend and whenever i'm going through something i'll toss two or three ideas over and you know he'll give me input on well 

281.40 284.09 A: you know i wouldn't do this but i'd do this 

284.08 285.08 B: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

284.21 289.55 A: and that's how my and that's how my communication is with my fiancee like right now 

289.45 300.40 A: i'm unemployed i've been unemployed for about a year because due to an injury and i'm trying to find a job but where i live it's very hard to find a job 

299.53 301.38 B: [noise] yeah [noise] 

300.74 305.70 A: and so i'm tossing round the idea of becoming self-employed well 

304.58 305.53 B: right 

305.70 316.83 A: she supports me on it so i'm tossing ideas left and right to her and that's another thing of having a life mate i mean you should be able to talk to them without them getting on the defence or 

316.84 324.05 A: you know saying well no you should do it this way because this way's better because this is the way i've done it all my life because everybody's different 

317.84 318.86 B: yeah 

322.24 323.33 B: yeah 

323.81 333.01 B: and then i uh i think another thing is somebody that listens and has good per- uh positive outlook on things too i have it when everybody's negative about everything 

330.31 332.27 A: yeah 

333.71 334.61 B: so 

334.15 337.75 A: yes relationships do not work with negativity 

336.91 341.20 B: positive no pretty much nothing does though [laughter] 

340.08 341.47 A: yes 

341.91 349.50 A: so but um um another quality is that they get along with your family [noise] yes 

346.70 353.89 B: oh yeah and that they get along with their family that seems to be indicative also of what type of their personality is 

351.61 354.53 A: yeah yeah 

354.60 357.45 A: yes big time i mean 

354.67 355.51 B: (( [laughter] so )) 

356.17 364.85 B: i don't like it oh i hate my mom i don't know i don't want to go out with you because there's probably you know not that everybody's perfect when you can look at it but you know it's 

363.60 369.48 A: yeah well and also the fact that i mean you know i mean 

365.40 366.43 B: kinda 

369.86 377.09 A: just for example with my ex wife you know her and her mom have never gotten along but yet they have 

377.14 378.61 A: and it's like 

378.89 382.90 A: even though you get along with your family don't always take your family's advice 

382.87 383.87 B: no 

383.64 391.37 A: [noise] that's another part of hav- finding a soul mate because every time me and my ex wife would have problems her mom's solution was 

391.45 392.94 A: divorce him 

392.46 393.77 B: yeah 

393.36 399.35 A: and my mother in law has had five husbands yeah so 

396.78 398.42 B: [noise] oh my 

399.46 405.95 A: you know it's it's it's good to take family advice on certain things but also you know 

403.36 404.33 B: yeah 

406.27 414.78 A: go with your heart for a life mate as well because if you go with your head you can make some mistakes and hurt some people 

407.41 408.36 B: (( [noise] )) 

414.79 424.30 B: yeah and that's what also is somebody that can have a family but not run to them every time and tell them every little problem and then you know 

422.55 423.90 A: yes 

424.64 427.46 A: yeah 

424.75 429.59 B: expect them to still like the other person whenever they know the bad things too you know 

429.15 430.95 A: yeah 

429.73 433.03 B: that's for the partners to work out 

432.66 434.39 A: yeah 

433.78 434.67 B: but 

435.38 440.69 A: but you know and and also uh another thing to look for in a life mate is 

440.79 448.69 A: in my aspect is somebody who's not going to run in in in a moment's notice of trouble or or you know break off the relationship 

448.26 449.14 B: right 

449.44 450.35 A: (( you know )) 

450.16 451.51 B: yeah 

451.01 459.04 A: life's a gr- relationships are a growing process and everybody argues common knowledge common fact you know 

457.87 458.81 B: (( you're right )) 

459.17 466.24 A: um but if they're going to run at the sign of trouble that's somebody you don't want to hook up with because you're going be like well how stable is this going to be 

466.03 473.85 B: yeah and that's what's kind of nice about my uh friend is that she was dating the guy that she's married to now 

474.28 478.09 B: um before she moved [sigh] up to where we lived um 

478.37 483.76 A: [noise] [noise] mhm 

478.48 486.26 B: away you know and then they had broken up for about a year and a half and he was an attorney and um he had this big cocky attitude 

485.91 486.83 A: uh-huh 

486.18 490.77 B: and then all of a sudden you know he got in this car accident where he was almost killed 

490.57 491.64 A: oh wow 

490.63 502.22 B: and he has a brain injury and so now he has a much better attitude on life doesn't take things for granted treats people you know the way they're supposed to be treated so he 

500.42 502.15 A: yeah 

502.23 507.19 B: would have not made a very good life partner before but now things are going to do just fine [noise] 

504.48 505.54 A: no 

506.55 517.92 A: that's g- well see and that's another thing you know it's it's you get you got to see how they treat the other person you know i mean with my ex wife yeah she would put everybody above herself 

518.04 531.51 A: but in the same instance it was always well what about me what about me you know she was like for instance you know you you got to be able to take care of yourself as well as your significant other in the emotional department [noise] 

521.80 523.09 B: yeah 

531.04 532.04 B: right [noise] 

531.77 541.01 A: um like for instance you know i collect comic books and so i would spend two to five dollars on comics she would get mad financial wise 

540.58 541.98 B: (( oh no [laughter] )) 

541.34 548.76 A: but yet she spent ten dollars to twenty dollars every weekend to go to the races and buy cigarettes 

548.31 549.99 B: yeah 

549.35 557.29 A: and to me somebody to look for in a life partner is you can agree financially on a matter before you do it 

554.45 555.84 B: yeah 

557.41 567.23 A: 'cause she knew i didn't agree on her spending ten dollars at the races because that to me that's a waste of money to me collecting comics 

564.07 565.01 B: right 

567.51 570.14 A: in a sense is more like a an 

570.35 576.93 A: investment because a comic's bought today say ten fifteen years down the road could be worth 

571.38 572.26 B: mhm 

577.83 578.89 A: you know 

579.43 584.65 A: a hundred and fifty thousand dollars it's kind of like playing the stock market so 

581.33 582.21 B: uh-huh 

583.12 584.05 B: (( right [noise] )) 

584.67 593.83 A: you know if you're looking for a life mate you got to be somebody who's going to respect what you do as well as respect themselves 'cause if they don't respect themselves they're not going to respect you 

593.25 598.41 B: yeah they've got to have their own life first before they try to bring somebody else into their life 

597.68 599.01 A: yeah 

599.17 599.89 B: so
