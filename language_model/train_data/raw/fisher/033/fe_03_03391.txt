24.80 29.85 B: yeah well i'm not i don't plan on getting married i just like living in so i think 

30.22 31.83 B: it's an okay topic 

32.03 35.52 A: [cough] you uh so you are living with someone then 

35.45 36.58 B: yeah 

35.99 37.15 A: oh okay 

37.37 41.38 A: so what did you find or what do you find that's most important in your partner 

41.53 46.30 B: uh he was just a good buddy we could hang out we could talk 

46.83 49.78 B: um he's really funny mellow 

50.58 52.00 A: wonderful 

51.17 55.85 B: yep not the big sweeping romance 'cause i could feel it pretty quickly 

55.59 56.78 A: (( mhm )) 

56.57 57.58 B: (( i think )) 

57.76 59.80 A: [cough] it's not everlasting 

60.06 63.80 B: yeah i think just hang out and have fun goof off 

63.87 65.74 A: being good friends 

65.30 67.08 B: (( yeah makes a great )) 

65.93 69.96 A: yeah to me that would be the most important part of having a good friend 

70.66 71.97 A: i um 

70.94 73.43 B: everything else kinda dies out you know no 

73.20 74.38 A: mhm 

75.00 79.00 A: [lipsmack] right [cough] have you done this before 

79.35 80.70 B: no yeah 

80.12 82.42 A: [laughter] so we're both at this 

82.43 83.44 A: um 

84.04 85.79 A: um let's see 

86.31 92.29 A: i would i i have already said it i i would look for someone that could be my friend 

92.55 95.36 A: because um in my past 

95.47 97.91 A: my relationships have been 

98.03 103.05 A: sour because they we couldn't be friends we couldn't discuss 

103.21 108.22 A: you have to be able to communicate and when we met we weren't able to communicate at all 

108.56 112.94 B: yeah it just seems so impossible though i mean with the whole date set up 

112.01 113.91 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

113.25 117.39 B: that you become friends on a date that never made sense to me 

117.41 119.12 B: you know it's so awkward 

117.91 120.21 A: oh right right 

119.37 122.53 B: they're not really showing you the real you and you know 

121.72 122.56 A: no 

122.55 126.82 B: by the time you're a month into it you're just figuring out who the other person is it's 

126.29 127.65 A: exactly 

127.41 129.82 B: not normally a very good picture at that point 

131.01 132.07 A: no 

132.39 133.83 A: i um 

134.53 141.83 A: i'm finding that it's better for me to live alone because i haven't been able to make good choices in that area 

142.20 147.87 A: and um of course i'm older so at this point in my life it's not that big of a deal 

148.40 150.66 A: however um 

151.45 155.55 A: i don't i don't know where to go with this [laughter] i'm having trouble 

154.46 155.34 B: [laughter] 

155.74 156.95 A: um 

158.10 163.26 A: i've found for me spiritually that that helps me also 

164.00 165.24 A: um 

165.41 168.70 A: however we had different outlooks on that too 

169.11 170.17 A: so 

170.71 175.31 A: [lipsmack] but i think that if it was for me myself i would look for somebody that was spiritual 

175.34 177.06 A: and that i could 

177.21 186.16 A: have good conversations with we wouldn't have to talk to all the time obviously but that we could talk and work things out and that um 

186.72 191.57 A: you know we could do things together once in a while but yet we still could be our own person 

192.63 193.45 A: (( [cough] )) 

194.22 197.74 A: are you pretty much like that or is your 

196.83 199.87 B: basically i mean i'm really independent 

199.89 201.49 A: yeah so am i 

200.30 204.32 B: so it worked out well that i just never really dated that much 

204.66 208.47 B: and you know plenty of offers but i just wasn't really interested 

204.77 205.95 A: oh 

207.93 209.33 A: mhm 

209.15 213.22 B: and uh i can't really get interested on a date it's just not 

213.51 216.60 B: (( i don't know it's too contrived )) 

216.66 217.25 A: (( [noise] )) 

217.44 220.89 A: well like you said nobody 

220.99 223.77 A: is themselves on a date 

223.93 228.37 A: you always try to be somebody else or somebody better than who you are or 

229.07 231.40 A: trying to make an impression i guess that's 

231.52 233.03 A: what i'm getting at 

232.82 234.03 B: yeah 

233.77 235.25 A: and um 

236.14 243.85 A: and that that'll last for a while you can pretend my my husband did he uh he was a great pretender until we got married 

244.09 245.18 B: yeah 

244.64 248.18 A: and that night i knew he was a different person 

248.62 250.89 B: yeah it i mean that's 

250.93 255.94 B: one of the problems i have with marriage is i've seen i watched in my parents' marriage you wanna make sure 

256.07 258.56 B: if you're gonna be with someone for the rest of your life 

259.08 262.10 B: that you're very very happy with that outcome you know [laughter] 

261.63 264.61 A: [cough] right how long have you been with this person 

264.83 266.07 B: uh a year 

266.19 267.08 A: a year 

266.21 269.83 B: we've been good friends for a couple of years before we ever 

270.44 272.81 B: even thought about being together 

272.18 273.61 A: mhm 

272.86 275.43 B: we didn't start out we just hung out 

275.92 277.09 A: right 

276.47 284.12 B: so it worked out much better you know i've watched things go around like uh my mother's gay so she has a life partner 

284.48 290.60 B: and they're very very happy but you know it came out about three days before their twenty fifth wedding anniversary 

289.99 291.52 A: (( [mn] )) 

291.47 297.82 B: so i don't have great views on marriage i like the idea of the life partner just 

292.07 293.35 A: (( oh my god )) 

297.68 298.80 A: right 

297.93 301.92 B: somebody you can live with and i think for some people marriage is too official 

302.41 303.59 A: well it is 

302.51 307.37 B: they just the words husband and wife change something in their head with how they look at each other 

304.82 305.68 A: (( [cough] )) 

307.13 308.99 A: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

309.12 314.11 B: like suddenly they're taken for granted like i've got you locked up [laughter] it's contractual now 

314.58 318.14 B: and then uh it's just easier to to think of them 

314.58 315.60 A: right 

318.30 320.09 B: like this other entity 

320.28 323.94 B: rather than the person you actually started with in the beginning you know 

323.32 324.37 A: mhm 

325.47 329.66 A: i guess that's where i come into it spiritually because i think that if people 

331.21 332.44 A: (( are )) 

332.48 346.34 A: if they're both in that room you have to you have to be either both are both or not and i think that's where the problem comes in if one of you is and one of you isn't if either if you're both not then that works out good 

346.37 351.27 A: and uh but if one is and one isn't then that seems to be a real problem 

351.40 352.42 B: yeah 

352.24 355.69 A: and uh actually it's a terrible problem 

356.04 357.00 A: so 

356.97 365.03 B: i mean i never thought what i wanted was all that hard honest friendly relaxed funny kind 

363.29 364.36 A: uh-huh 

365.22 369.62 B: you know that shouldn't be rocket science and it's a lot harder 

365.88 367.19 A: exactly 

369.64 370.40 A: oh 

370.67 371.68 A: yes 

371.56 374.11 B: you know than people give credit for 

373.87 378.77 A: there are very few people that have a lot of those qualities all in one 

379.84 381.20 A: and um 

381.73 384.05 A: [lipsmack] i've met i've met a few 

384.44 390.61 A: that um are married friends that have husbands that are like that and um 

390.84 392.46 A: i think it's wonderful 

392.88 395.77 A: you know and i hope for you it works out really good too 

396.62 399.96 B: oh yeah we've we've done pretty well so far 

399.72 400.71 A: (( [laughter] )) 

400.46 409.82 B: it's the first time i've ever been able to argue with someone and both of us walk away from it actually having resolved it he's very good about talking things out and 

407.28 408.12 A: that 

409.30 410.35 A: mhm 

410.16 414.29 B: you know you don't just ignore until it goes away and that's really healthy 

414.37 416.13 A: it's very healthy 

416.19 425.23 A: and that's that's the difference between somebody that's gonna make it and somebody that won't because if you can't walk if you can't talk it out and you can't work it out 

425.89 427.21 A: it's just gonna 

427.34 431.21 A: boil inside until it eventually blows 

431.48 432.44 B: yeah 

432.08 433.42 A: and um 

434.32 436.37 A: i'm really sorry to hear about your mother 

437.09 443.82 B: yeah i mean it's okay she's happier now and my father's happier now he's remarried but it was just really odd to grow up 

444.21 446.66 B: with thinking of marriage in one respect 

447.02 451.55 B: and then they both split up and i was actually relieved by that but they shouldn't have been together [laughter] 

451.57 452.93 A: right 

451.68 458.38 B: and now they're so much happier in relationships that are right for 'em because they're with someone with the same values 

457.90 468.06 A: mhm yes and that's what i meant i guess more than anything its it's not just spiritual but the same values and you hit the right word 

468.19 469.39 A: because that 

469.97 473.76 A: as you were saying doesn't work otherwise [cough] 

474.47 475.41 A: (( so )) 

476.14 477.35 A: um 

477.56 481.42 A: let's see what else size height does any of that matter 

478.95 479.83 B: [laughter] 

481.20 483.04 B: not really i mean 

483.56 489.62 B: i don't know i'm a i'm a pretty tall person and my last boyfriend was pretty short [laughter] 

488.90 490.08 A: really 

489.66 493.11 B: it's never really bothered me the appearance but mainly 

493.14 499.44 B: they've gotta be really funny they've gotta be really nice and if they're not i just can't 

500.08 504.08 B: uh there's something i don't trust about pretty people [laughter] 

500.73 502.22 A: i love the humor 

503.31 505.60 A: yeah i love the humor 

505.83 513.18 A: i i love to be around people that are funny and that can take something serious and still smile and laugh about it 

513.34 515.86 B: exactly that's rated above everything 

514.32 515.23 A: yeah 

516.00 518.40 A: [laughter] 

516.18 516.90 B: (( [laughter] )) 

518.45 519.75 A: oh 

519.95 520.92 A: (( so )) 

521.53 524.67 A: yeah i'm i'm pretty much that way or i try to be 

525.06 528.77 A: like to always have a smile on my face and 

529.68 530.82 B: yeah 

529.69 531.96 A: get along with everybody [laughter] 

532.94 533.91 A: so 

533.94 539.18 A: [lipsmack] let's see size color hair nationalities 

538.96 541.03 B: no nothing really 

541.16 545.50 B: i've i've been all over the board [laughter] in all the categories yeah 

543.46 544.30 A: have you 

545.09 553.29 A: yeah in in our family i have a niece well actually my son in law i'm caucasian my daughter's caucasian and my son in law is chinese [lipsmack]

564.46 565.43 B: [laughter]

567.98 568.88 B: yeah 

569.01 570.31 A: did we get a beep 

571.01 572.26 B: i don't think so 

571.80 575.36 A: oh i think it's my cell phone [laughter] sorry 

573.95 574.93 B: [laughter] 

575.77 580.45 A: but and they just had a baby and he's so cute but um 

579.45 580.16 B: oh 

580.80 583.77 B: yeah it's never the things you think you're looking for 

583.46 584.60 A: (( mhm )) 

583.90 587.94 B: in the beginning you know like when you're a little kid what you think you're gonna be looking for 

586.57 598.75 A: oh yeah right this is the ideal person [laughter] i'm gonna be happily married by the time i'm x. number of years old and and have so many kids and a white picket fence 

588.22 589.75 B: it's never those things 

594.12 594.98 B: (( [laughter] )) 

597.26 599.95 B: (( and they're gonna look like this and they'll do this and they'll do ))
