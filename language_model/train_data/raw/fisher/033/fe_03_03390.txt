4.58 6.40 B: oh hi carol how are you 

5.86 7.82 A: (( i'm doing pretty good )) 

6.97 11.48 B: oh great uh this is my first time doing this have you done one of these before or 

9.83 15.60 A: [laughter] i've never done this before i just i just signed up today 

12.80 14.30 B: oh [laughter] 

15.29 16.59 B: (( so did i )) 

15.99 19.30 A: oh my gosh i was really surprised that they called so soon 

19.16 22.35 B: i was really surprised too yeah [laughter] 

21.52 26.15 A: so we're supposed to be talking about what's important in selecting a life partner 

25.55 27.51 B: right right 

26.48 28.62 A: what do you think wendy 

28.06 34.98 B: uh well let's see i think most important is probably honesty and trust 

35.37 36.67 B: uh 

36.69 38.00 B: how about you 

37.93 47.06 A: well definitely honesty and trust um do you have a um are you involved with somebody can you talk about it um from a personal perspective 

46.61 57.96 B: oh sure i'm uh married i have been with my husband for about eleven years we've been married for eight of those and uh we have two children and uh 

53.19 54.55 A: wow 

56.07 56.97 A: uh-huh 

58.15 68.36 B: of course there's ups and downs and stuff but i find that the most important thing uh when i chose him was that i felt um 

68.56 78.89 B: that he was uh very sincere uh honest trustworthy um supportive yeah how 'bout yourself 

74.60 75.59 A: uh-huh 

78.27 83.60 A: well um i am not presently married but i've been with my sweetie for um 

83.63 92.35 A: [lipsmack] two years a little bit over two years we've been dating but we actually just moved in with each other [laughter] in novem- um in january of this year so 

92.17 93.78 B: oh wow [noise] 

92.53 104.79 A: um but he's he's a really really wonderful person and um and one of the things that i really love about him is um the fact that i can he's one of the few men that i've ever dated that i can actually trust so i definitely agree with you 

104.72 109.51 A: that trust is um paramount and definitely honesty 

109.52 112.08 A: and um [lipsmack] when you 

112.30 113.49 A: those 

113.55 116.79 A: um qualities in a man a lot of the other things 

116.66 129.15 A: you know as far as um the superficial things like looks and money and all those things those are not important and when i was younger unfortunately a lotta those superficial things were the things that i valued 

128.95 130.31 B: (( okay right )) 

129.23 133.30 A: you know but the older i get [laughter] the more i realize 

133.24 147.55 A: that um you know just being able to go to bed at night and have great peace of mind you know you don't have to worry about so many other things that that we did when we were younger 

147.66 161.24 A: you know so i don't know um what your experience was like [laughter] before you met your husband but um when you find somebody that you can trust and definitely is honest i think those are the people [laughter] that you hold on to 

160.89 174.60 B: right right 'cause looks can fade and money comes and go off really quickly these days [laughter] and uh yeah those i feel like if you get those things then those are just kinda bonuses on top of everything else 

161.55 162.50 A: you know 

165.53 167.96 A: [mn] right right 

174.01 180.28 A: right and i think um a a lotta times people are looking for those qualities in other people but 

180.24 191.33 A: if you wanna honest person you have to be an honest person yourself if you wanna man that you can trust you need to be a trustworthy person yourself and um 

183.77 185.25 B: exactly 

191.21 197.52 A: because whatever happens in a relationship a lotta the times you can't control those things you can only control the person that you are 

197.46 208.73 A: and um and what you bring to the table [laughter] and if you're yelling and screaming at your mate because he was dishonest about something you just need to look at yourself in the mirror [laughter] and a lotta the time 

208.69 214.02 A: you know the standards that we hold for others are the standards we definitely should hold for ourselves 

213.28 219.39 B: right exactly i know it's uh earlier in my relationship with my husband uh 

219.52 231.67 B: i would catch him uh he would come home from work [noise] and said he came straight home from work and i would find out by checking the bank that he had stopped and bought a c. d. at a music store [laughter] on the way home 

230.76 232.83 A: (( [laughter] oh gosh )) 

231.45 236.86 B: and even though that's just a little white lie you know it's just 

236.92 251.69 B: i just feel like you should just lay everything out on the table and and let let everything fall where it may and uh i wasn't upset for him making a purchase it was just [cough] don't come home and pretend like you just came straight home [laughter] 

240.06 241.24 A: right 

249.79 261.97 A: right right and you know the thing about it is a lotta times those little things are the things that you you know if he's not honest about something little you wonder what other things is he dishonest about 

261.26 263.59 B: exactly the bigger things 

261.97 270.84 A: [laughter] so so you um and then you're on guard and you know you're suspicious and you're looking for so many other things but 

270.70 283.17 A: um but that definitely is um the key being honest and i i pride myself on being a you know an honest person but you know there are certain areas in my life that need work too 

279.77 280.88 B: right 

283.08 285.74 A: [laughter] 

283.42 297.69 B: oh i know yeah if we were perfect to people wouldn't exist i don't think [laughter] so you always wanna strive for being your best but i know i fall short quite probably daily [laughter] 

288.52 290.33 A: i know 

296.84 300.97 A: right and you know the other thing that i'm concerned about um 

301.06 312.45 A: my my we should be be fiances soon um and you know a lotta times when you pick a mate like you've been married now you said for eleven years right 

304.63 305.47 B: uh-huh 

311.57 314.15 B: [lipsmack] ah yeah been together for eleven yeah 

313.29 316.22 A: and how many how many children did you say that you have 

315.71 324.10 B: uh we have two we have an eight year old and then we have a one and a half year old so we've got quite a little age gap there [laughter] 

319.88 321.13 A: wow 

321.21 332.29 A: [laughter] yeah one thing that i'm really concerned about is um you know when you get involved in a relationship a lotta times after you have kids the relationship changes so much 

332.18 346.36 A: and the women are the ones with so much of the responsibility of raising the children you know and you know when i was younger i never thought about um those kinds of qualities in a man what he would be like as a father 

342.49 343.43 B: (( right [noise] )) 

346.35 357.58 A: you know because um like now i mean you know when you get married there's no [laughter] i mean it's no joke it's it's a serious commitment and so a lot 

346.36 347.19 B: (( uh-huh )) 

356.02 366.13 B: oh yeah you're also if you have kids from a previous uh relationship it's it's your kids you're involved in any relationship just beside yourself 

361.03 362.22 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

366.30 381.21 B: so i know that's one thing i i definitely did did well on is that when i met my husband he had two dogs and he just dotted on them like they were like they were uh his kids he would take them out morning and noon and night and 

374.89 376.60 A: oh okay 

381.23 391.36 B: uh so i knew he would be a really good father and any time he's home he takes over changing the diaper and uh all of that kinda stuff so that's 

390.33 392.07 A: oh that's great 

391.27 399.80 B: yeah so that that was really important to me 'cause i knew i did wanna have kids and i knew i didn't wanna have them by myself [laughter] so 

397.47 403.80 A: [laughter] right so you you sound like you did pretty well when you chose him 

401.78 408.29 B: yeah i did and there's quite an age difference between us he's he's uh forty seven and i'm thirty three 

407.87 408.98 A: okay 

408.43 420.40 B: so but and and i think in a way [noise] with having kids it was much better to pick an older partner and i just lucked out that he didn't have any children from a previous relationship 

419.53 421.19 A: right 

420.56 426.58 B: so uh he was ready and uh really appreciated having the kids once they came along 

422.31 423.37 A: mhm 

426.33 436.15 A: oh okay 'cause i i don't have any kids and um and i'm thirty seven years old and i've been very very careful along the line not i've never even been pregnant 

426.81 428.59 B: so yeah 

431.60 432.55 B: oh okay 

435.83 436.68 B: yeah 

436.09 447.12 A: you know so um when i have children [laughter] all of my family and my friends they have kids and i've looked at um their relationships and 

446.97 453.33 A: you know how hard it is to be a parent how hard it is to be a wife how hard it is to be a husband 

453.09 454.09 B: (( [noise] right )) 

453.44 460.71 A: and um and a lotta times we glamorize things or we fantasize about things but when you have to come home 

460.57 475.51 A: and the clothes are on the floor or the toilet is not washed or the dishes are in the sink and it's a mess you know and you see a lotta bad habits for your mate that when you were in the dating stage you know [laughter] those things weren't 

474.46 475.90 B: [laughter] 

475.36 484.61 A: important you know and when you live with somebody on a day to day basis you know you have to be very very careful whether or not you want that person to be your life mate 

476.67 477.80 B: right 

484.20 486.13 B: exactly yeah 

485.55 487.54 A: [laughter] i know i'm so blessed 

486.52 493.49 B: and once you have kids i mean they come first and uh romance pretty much goes out the window [laughter] i know by the time 

491.50 493.32 A: [laughter] 

493.27 504.91 B: my husband i climb in bed at night i think we get to w- watch about a half an hour of t. v. and we're just exhausted we just have two high energy kids that are very demanding and uh 

505.39 513.07 B: [laughter] our big luxury is we we pick up one television program to watch and then it's it's time for us to go to sleep 

512.71 516.72 A: wow so there was a big gap between your kids 

516.67 528.09 B: right yeah we we were happy with just our son which is our oldest and didn't really expect to have another one we live in a small house and uh she was just kind of a surprise and 

520.64 521.55 A: uh-huh 

527.98 535.98 B: uh just couldn't imagine life without her now she she had to be special to be able to compete with her brother for attention and she's 

530.79 532.87 A: [laughter] oh wow 

535.05 536.62 A: so do you they get along 

536.67 545.76 B: oh they get along great he just adores her but he doesn't want anybody else to adore her [laughter] he still wants all the attention [laughter] 

541.46 543.42 A: oh okay
