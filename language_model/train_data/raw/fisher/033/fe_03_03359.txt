46.00 48.54 A: i don't know do you think it's different 

48.17 55.05 B: well act- i don't know i just broke up with my girlfriend i don't think it's a really good topic to talk about but um 

56.06 57.73 B: i don't know um 

58.61 67.62 B: you know love is not going to last that long you know what i mean i mean there is love tha- i guess in a life time partner it's something um 

68.05 70.71 B: just when you get old just to help out 

71.01 71.89 B: (( you know )) 

72.47 73.46 A: yeah 

72.60 75.88 B: just help each other out and just live life together 

76.24 78.24 B: i think that's the main thing 

76.51 78.04 A: yeah i think that's 

78.06 79.35 A: i mean there's 

79.39 86.87 A: 'cause you can definitely fall in love with someone and it can be a temporary thing like just 'cause you're in love with someone doesn't mean it's going to last forever you know 

86.73 93.78 B: yeah yeah i mean if it's like you're in love and if you married someone i mean like right now i'm just twenty you know 

88.05 89.16 A: so 

93.92 94.73 A: (( mm )) 

93.99 101.13 B: and you know it's not going to last that long i mean it is going to last a long but once i hit like forty or whatever you know 

101.10 102.96 A: mhm 

101.78 107.44 B: there it's not going to be love it's just um just a partner who's going to help each other out 'cause you live together 

107.52 113.30 A: yeah now do you think it's possible to find a life long partner when you're twenty 

108.43 109.47 B: (( yeah )) 

113.67 114.70 B: um 

115.63 124.00 B: i could be but it's going to be hard for me to know you know like right now i'm just like still young and i i'm still having experience of my life 

118.59 119.69 A: mhm 

124.22 128.23 B: so even if i find one i don't know what exactly i'm going to look for 

128.27 130.11 A: mhm 

128.98 132.34 B: so it's going be hard for me to uh make a decision right now 

132.71 145.74 A: yeah that's true yeah i know for me i'm not married i think i think communication i think if i find a girl that i can really talk to 

134.21 134.99 B: (( right )) 

140.47 141.38 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

145.66 147.35 B: mhm 

146.48 150.38 A: that uh that she be the one and i think that takes time you 

150.46 156.60 B: [noise] yeah i mean i just broke up with my girlfriend a couple of weeks ago and i've been going out with her for like a year or so 

151.23 153.55 A: know but 

156.56 157.95 A: oh right 

157.43 159.72 B: and i think we just had um 

160.12 161.79 B: bad communication 

162.41 165.71 B: that's what i think like we had like a lot of misunderstandings 

166.21 167.31 B: (( and [mn] )) 

168.70 177.57 B: i don't know like a life time uh partner they should uh at least not lie to each other and you tell them whole thing has to be true even if you made a mistake 

177.48 179.29 A: mhm 

178.30 179.70 B: (( yeah mm )) 

180.37 182.45 A: huh so so 

183.18 184.26 A: how 

184.63 191.74 A: how did you come to the realization that you know she definitely wasn't going to be the life lifetime partner i 

191.25 193.44 B: [noise] there was um 

193.55 200.79 B: we had a lot of difference i mean we tried to work out but like i'm a i'm a kind of guy that out of his 

201.09 204.44 B: go out of h- like i don't like to hang out with a lot of people 

204.43 205.31 A: (( guess mhm )) 

204.62 211.38 B: you know i just if i hang out i'm just going to hang out with like five six of my close friends i just drink beers and just 

211.52 218.20 B: dumb stuff like that whereas in she loved to go to club and like meet new people every time 

218.37 219.69 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

219.11 227.67 B: you know and like at first i thought like she was trying to make me jealous or something or whatever right so uh i got over that but like [noise] 

224.55 225.37 A: yeah 

228.11 242.76 B: i don't know she and i were just looking for different things so for about a year we just worked each other out and we came to the conclusion that we ain't like we weren't we're still good friends but we weren't like meant to be as like long term partner 

242.88 244.38 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

243.18 248.49 B: [mn] so like what so we still talk we're still good friends but you know 

249.17 257.74 A: so really it wasn't like the communication thing it sounds like you guys talked you know everything was out on the table things like that it was just almost the difference in interests 

254.82 255.55 B: (( yes )) 

256.19 263.42 B: and there was some stuff she didn't tell me like some stuff like she met a guy at a club and like she didn't le- really want to tell me about 

263.47 264.63 A: mhm 

264.07 274.25 B: and she was talking to him and like i found out through her friend and like i had to go and ask her about it you know like i'm going did you like meet such and such guy and like 

267.95 269.06 A: mhm 

274.10 280.14 B: which at the club and she's like yeah and like why didn't you tell me about it and she's like i though you were going to get mad you know 

280.74 285.41 B: and i'm like i would it be to you tell me not your friend telling me you know 

285.57 286.90 A: right 

286.33 290.50 B: so there was some stuff like it's like it just built up 

290.23 294.95 A: mhm now how long do you think it takes for 

291.30 292.18 B: uh-huh 

295.02 302.27 A: for someone to realize like okay this is the person for me you know what i mean like can you do it in less than a year is that possible or 

302.34 308.63 B: if you are going to think that person is a lifetime partner i'd say it's gonna take uh at least about a year 

308.59 310.04 A: mhm 

309.22 312.98 B: you know like some people say they fall in love you know like first sight in love and stuff 

313.64 321.53 B: but that's like as far as i know that's not going to last that long you know it's just gonna crash if you gonna try to find a life time long partner 

317.57 318.64 A: yeah 

321.85 326.00 B: you need at least like know them a lot more and a lot better 

325.77 327.12 A: mhm 

326.49 327.32 B: (( you know )) 

328.20 329.26 B: (( so [mn] )) 

329.70 336.07 A: yeah that's true i mean and i don't know i think the idea of a life long partner is starting to change too 

329.86 331.39 B: (( mhm )) 

336.01 337.85 B: mhm 

336.19 342.13 A: i mean you know over a half of marriages are div- end in divorces and 

342.24 354.61 A: [sigh] i don't know like you know you got the working class women now kids are kind of a less priority i mean the concept of a family which i think is what kept you know two people together is is drastically changing 

356.06 359.35 A: so i think you know what i mean if you got two working people 

359.49 367.20 A: you know i mean that's it's kind of hard to to be together and have the same interests when you're leading two separate lives you know 

366.43 373.99 B: (( yeah [noise] yeah [noise] yeah [mn] [noise] mhm )) 

372.06 379.41 A: yeah but for me i think i don't know i'm not really close to to finding a partner that's for sure 

379.49 384.24 A: at least uh a life long one but but i've been in love before 

384.35 387.98 A: you know like would you say that you're in love with your girlfriend you'd say that wouldn't you 

388.50 395.45 B: yeah [noise] pretty much i mean like it's kind of hard to define what the love is to start out with anyway you know 

395.49 396.41 A: mhm 

395.78 397.55 B: (( so then i pretty much like )) 

398.65 407.68 B: as far as i know like as far as i can tell people she was the first person that i've really liked a lot more than just a friend 

404.55 405.46 A: mhm 

406.78 408.19 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

407.78 419.14 B: you know so to me i think i've really loved her and i still do like her a lot but like i feel like she's not the uh person that i'm uh going to be with for the rest of my life 

418.18 419.87 A: yeah 

419.21 424.56 B: that's why we came to uh this conclusion that we should uh just separate but i still like her a lot you know 

422.61 423.87 A: (( yeah so )) 

424.56 433.99 A: yeah yeah well okay now here's the next question do you feel like that when you start looking for another girlfriend are you going to be looking for 

424.60 425.44 B: (( [noise] so )) 

432.34 433.62 B: (( mhm )) 

433.84 444.31 A: like you know okay before i really get into this i want to see if she's going to be my life long partner or are you just going to do your thing for a year again and then evaluate the situation in a year's time 

444.08 450.49 B: right now if i were to meet a new person and if i talked to her and if i think she's pretty cool i'm just going to keep talking to her 

450.37 451.38 A: mhm 

450.51 454.95 B: i'm not going to make a decision that like i'm still young you know 

454.89 456.05 A: mhm 

455.48 463.97 B: so for right now for me i'm just going to like if i meet a person and if she's pretty cool i'll just like keep in touch with her and talk to her 

463.89 465.70 A: mhm 

464.75 479.33 B: and hopefully at one point that i can actually feel that she's a life time person that i can like you know just ask her or like to be with me for a long time but like i'm not going to ask her like till i meet somebody twenty six or seven you know 

474.69 475.46 A: mhm 

479.33 484.01 B: (( i'm going to have like certain job and like you know i'm going to have certain things settled )) 

479.48 480.28 A: yeah 

484.04 486.84 B: (( before i ask someone to actually to marry me you know )) 

486.36 488.09 A: yeah 

488.06 495.22 B: so if i meet a person [noise] right now you know i just go talk to 'em but like i'm not actually looking for any relationship anyway so 

495.38 498.17 A: (( yeah now what do you want in a )) 

498.18 501.00 A: in a you know partner for life 

501.02 505.53 A: you want a stay at home mom you want someone that's going to raise your kids you want you know working 

505.61 506.92 A: working wife mhm 

505.69 511.84 B: uh it sort of depends on her you know um as long as she can raise a child and if she want to get a job 

515.84 517.96 B: [noise] if she want to get a job that's fine 

518.05 519.74 A: mhm 

519.03 520.35 B: (( [noise] but if )) 

521.19 524.68 B: she wants to get a job and if she can still raise a child that's fine with me 

524.85 526.37 B: (( [noise] you know )) 

526.39 528.39 B: so [noise] it's all up to her 

528.93 536.68 A: yeah you seem pretty flexible on that now did you did you ever talk about marriage with your ex girlfriend you know did you talk about that much 

531.39 532.22 B: (( yeah )) 

535.22 535.87 B: (( nah )) 

536.54 540.00 B: i mean like we talked about it it was like kind of joking 

539.99 541.30 A: uh-huh [noise] 

540.54 542.80 B: it wasn't talking you know 

542.99 543.79 A: mhm 

543.17 552.38 B: we didn't like talked about it we're like yeah da da da da like let's get married wh- wh- when i'm like twenty seven and she's twenty six but you know that wasn't a real serious you know 

552.01 553.44 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

552.78 555.60 B: (( [noise] so mm it's not that big )) 

556.80 558.97 B: i haven't really talked to anyone about about marriage [noise] 

556.96 557.98 A: (( did you two )) 

559.23 562.29 A: yeah so i mean

567.24 570.82 A: we've talked about marriage you know i can't deny that 

571.39 577.21 A: but [sigh] probably it sounds like i've probably talked about it more than you have but it's um 

571.78 572.34 B: (( [mn] )) 

578.39 584.37 A: you know it's always a touchy subject you know how many kids you want you know things like that 

582.67 589.22 B: yeah it's like that i mean [noise] we talk about those kind of stuff but we knew it wasn't that serious you know
