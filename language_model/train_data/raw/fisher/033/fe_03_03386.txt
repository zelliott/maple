28.30 38.70 B: you know he has to be uh fun and you know he has to be able to um remember what it was like to be young you know to be more youthful 

38.77 39.95 B: um 

40.17 47.43 B: [lipsmack] he can't be too conservative i don't like that too much and he has to really love kids although i don't have any i wanna have some 

47.92 49.18 A: [noise] 

47.98 57.28 B: and uh he just has to be um you know even if he's older he just has to be really youthful and you know not so much a stick in the mud basically 

57.21 60.63 A: right and can adapt to a lotta different ch- changes 

57.62 58.82 B: (( that's what i think )) 

60.22 65.52 B: yeah yeah he has to be the kinda person who's who's not argumentative 

65.62 71.82 B: either you know just really easy going reserved and open to uh new ideas you know

87.95 88.94 A: [laughter] 

88.28 97.74 B: everything about me is pretty youthful so i i like older men so i i really prefer someone older that is you know a life partner he has to be a really fun person 

97.98 100.92 B: he really does that's what i think is really important 

101.01 103.54 A: i'm forty six so i'm like 

104.02 108.44 A: i'm single still i mean i've i've had my relationships but 

105.33 106.35 B: uh-huh 

108.56 109.64 A: i'm just 

110.03 122.03 A: really now i'm not interested in anybody [laughter] because it's just been my daughter and i for so long that i'm afraid that if i get attached to somebody and they get attached to me 

113.95 115.11 B: yeah 

122.05 127.49 A: and we start you know being together all the time i'm afraid i wouldn't be able to 

127.57 133.62 A: handle it you know 'cause i'm used to doing what i wanna do when i wanna do it how i wanna do it 

128.84 129.79 B: uh-huh 

133.15 134.28 B: right 

133.99 138.28 A: so they would in the same sense as me they would have to be able to 

138.56 149.27 A: you know go along with things and just go along with them and don't worry about it you know [laughter] what i wanna do let's do it and that's it if i don't wanna do it fine you know 

143.86 145.21 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

148.89 149.90 B: right 

150.98 158.38 A: so i just you know like i said after you've been you know it's just you you and your daughter for so long that's how you feel you know 

151.09 152.03 B: yeah 

157.88 158.86 B: mhm 

158.40 163.76 A: you still want relationships and everything but you don't want them around you constantly 

163.58 164.58 B: right 

165.06 167.32 A: that's how i feel anyway [laughter] 

165.09 165.93 B: (( yeah i )) 

166.64 171.32 B: i i had what i thought was going to be a life partner a long time ago 

171.39 175.45 B: and um but i i should've known from the very beginning um 

175.53 189.31 B: that it really wasn't going to work out because we were arguing a lot before we even thought of getting married and he had uh nearly cheated on me with someone else before i actually thought of marrying him i forgave him 

189.51 193.32 B: and um he was kinda leaning all over me 

193.34 203.18 B: pretty much making me feel like uh whatever emotional burden he had that i was supposed to carry it which i would have but you have to it has to be equal you know on both ends 

202.39 204.73 A: exactly right 

203.31 213.97 B: and i wanted him to do the same thing for me and he couldn't do that you know and and his parents were always in the way his father was almost like a third party in the relationship because he didn't want us together 

214.07 228.72 B: and um no matter what happened uh it was like even if we weren't around his family it's like they were always there they never liked me and they didn't really care that much about him they didn't want anybody caring about him because they were just you know those kinda people 

228.62 229.66 A: (( [mn] )) 

228.70 239.86 B: but yeah they they uh he was like the black sleep of the family as far as they were concerned but they weren't all that straight upstairs either and i guess i thought that when i got married that i could 

239.78 249.67 B: make things better for him i could uh not really change him into somebody that i would've preferred to be with but to try to change the things that were keeping us arguing all the time 

250.02 264.26 B: um i should've known from the beginning that he had a jealous streak i should've known that if a guy so much as looked at me he wasn't going to be able to handle it i mean i don't understand how a person could have a life partner and never expect uh the usual things that happen 

264.06 276.94 B: not that the person is ever going to cheat on you but that other people are bound to find you attractive and they're bound to find the other person attractive and until they know you are committed they're bound to say something they're bound to approach one or the other 

276.91 291.67 B: i've i've learned to be a bit more open-minded about that and not freak out so much you know with the idea of a girl looking at my guy but when i was married my uh husband could not handle that and i worked around men and women in in this uh 

284.44 285.37 A: mhm 

291.59 292.59 B: um 

292.80 301.48 B: [lipsmack] uh record store that i was in i had to greet people when they came in it got to the point where my husband wasn't even working anymore he was hanging around the record store watching me 

301.88 306.04 B: so [laughter] you know you can't have a life partner doing that 

303.79 309.43 A: [mn] see that's that's something that there's no way you can base a relationship on that even a marriage 

309.32 310.16 B: mhm 

309.44 315.24 A: because it's right there he's saying that he does not trust you and there's got to be trust in a relationship 

314.58 315.74 B: that's right 

315.96 317.12 B: that's right 

315.96 319.26 A: there's definitely got to be trust i mean that's one of the first things 

318.94 320.15 B: (( mhm )) 

320.54 329.74 B: and he didn't he didn't have that i mean he he always felt that i wasn't really his he later told me that as we got divorced he didn't feel i really belonged to him 

329.85 339.76 B: and he felt there was somebody out there for him but the whole time he was with me he always felt that there was somebody better and that i may have been secretly looking for whomever that was 

339.84 351.75 B: but i didn't feel i was doing that it's just that when i came to work crying all the time because we'd been fighting normally uh people pick up on that and they start to try to comfort you try to find out what's wrong 

351.75 355.65 B: and um he took it a whole different way you know 

355.50 368.96 B: he felt he was doing the best he could as far as working and i felt that he was too but when he ultimately stopped to start following me and watching me and then we would go to this gym to work out my trainer couldn't couldn't help me because my husband wouldn't let him 

355.68 356.79 A: right 

369.42 378.09 B: you know it was like he didn't want any other men around me looking at me and i like i said i thought this was gonna be a life partner until that happened and after about two and a half 

376.36 380.74 A: yeah i mean that's that's like saying you can't even walk down the street 

380.56 381.63 B: yeah 

380.85 382.90 A: 'cause somebody's gonna look at you 

382.42 394.51 B: yeah and if i was holding his if i wasn't holding his hand he would get upset if i he wanted me to be overly demonstrative affectionately in public and i didn't mind doing that but not for the reasons he wanted me to do it 

394.52 405.75 B: it was like he wanted it to be a signal to everybody in case other guys were looking she's mine you can't have her it didn't matter to him if i didn't want to be with somebody else it just mattered to him if somebody thought they could have me 

406.26 415.47 B: so after about two and a half years of that i said well i don't think so anymore i'd love to be married again but at least this time i'd be more aware i was twenty one 

406.81 407.68 A: (( [mn] )) 

415.49 422.98 B: when i got married the first time and considered uh having a lifetime relationship and it was for the wrong reasons i think 

422.89 425.37 A: yeah that's still young too 

423.12 424.30 B: (( but that's how )) 

425.06 435.01 B: yeah i felt my reasons were were pretty innocent i mean i don't think a person should marry someone because they're sleeping with them outside of marriage and they're afraid uh of losing them 

435.27 436.19 B: um 

436.09 438.68 B: you know that the sexual thing should never be 

438.58 443.78 B: the bottom line as far as why people should be getting married it should be beyond that 

443.63 455.88 B: and i got married because i was uh afraid of the pressure i was getting from my mom because we were sleeping together before we actually got married and she never really let up on me the church never let up on me it just got to be 

455.73 459.49 B: too much so i i married for the wrong reasons i'm never going to do that again 

459.53 467.38 B: never again your body is your body and what you do with it is your business and you know church and people shouldn't have anything to say about that 

467.34 468.51 A: right 

467.45 477.06 B: so premarital sex or whatever it is that's a whole another topic for people to discuss and argue about and all of that but it's also a part of life 

477.01 479.60 B: and if if had i realized that 

477.17 478.29 A: mhm 

479.50 492.71 B: before i had gotten married it would've been a whole different situation for me and i wouldn't have rushed into it outta fear of spiritual retribution or fear of not being um thought of the same way by my mom you know 

493.12 501.32 B: it's it's ridiculous the people that put the most pressure on that are the people who got pregnant before they got married and married someone just to make everything better 

501.34 509.46 B: and that's wrong too if i was pregnant right now yeah if i was pregnant now and didn't get along with the father of my child i wouldn't marry him 

503.01 504.49 A: yes it is 

509.78 513.07 B: you know i would i would the child as a single mother if i had to 

513.19 516.06 B: and and take it on from there you know 

516.12 529.54 A: mhm as long as he wasn't a real jerk and wanted to i mean you wouldn't you know i wouldn't keep the baby from him or anything you know but you still would not marry him because like you said just because you're gonna have a child does not mean that you 

516.21 517.36 B: (( it's it's crazy )) 

519.91 520.71 B: mhm 

523.04 524.14 B: right 

529.68 532.44 A: want him as a life partner 

531.97 533.77 B: right right 

532.84 540.32 A: and if you were to marry him and you found out that this is definitely not you know for you or it's not for him 

537.72 538.65 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

540.34 542.50 A: who's gonna suffer but the child 

542.18 544.29 B: right exactly 

544.75 546.27 A: so it's 

544.88 545.76 B: yeah 

546.00 558.53 B: i don't think a lotta people these days though are thinking in terms of life partners anymore not from what i've seen around me and on t. v. and stuff like that i don't i don't think people are are thinking in that direction anymore i think some people feel that 

558.49 573.12 B: they're living one day to the next and that they don't know if tomorrow is promised so they're not looking down the road and seeing their whole life ahead of them they're just hoping somebody will love 'em for a day maybe a night maybe a month but 

573.24 578.35 B: i don't think there's a whole life lotta life partner type of thing going on a lotta divorces 

578.54 579.82 A: right 

578.59 586.46 B: because people have lost their jobs uh a lotta people might be marrying the person that just came back from the war because they thought they might lose them 

586.69 594.23 B: and that's not a good enough reason either but i don't think people are thinking in terms of that any anymore i think before the millennium people were 

594.75 597.98 B: before the year two thousand i think people really were 

597.70 599.89 A: and i think a lotta people are
