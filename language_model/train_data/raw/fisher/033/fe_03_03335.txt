19.01 20.00 A: yes 

19.88 21.96 B: okay you want to start 

21.75 22.64 A: sure 

22.46 24.54 B: okay go ahead 

23.65 32.77 A: um well i guess uh the most important thing is i think is obviously love but you also have to be very fr- you have to be a good friend with that person 

32.89 37.46 B: (( yeah l- love ends somewhere down the road )) 

35.59 36.61 A: yes 

37.50 38.89 B: (( [laughter] and )) 

38.17 41.94 A: yeah friendship and love are two of the most important things 

42.28 43.69 A: how about yourself 

43.77 48.35 B: then um i'm married for t- for uh t- thirteen years now 

48.36 49.25 A: uh-huh 

48.80 52.23 B: and i'm i think the friendship is the most important thing 

52.11 53.31 A: (( yes [mn] )) 

52.35 55.71 B: (( uh if you have a good partner that can um )) 

55.94 60.90 B: you can spend the long time of your life together that's the most important thing 

61.08 68.79 B: otherwise the love ends and then you have the kids and it becomes to be a very hard task life 

68.70 71.45 A: right you always need the friendship to fall back on 

70.97 71.90 B: uh-huh 

71.95 75.17 B: someone to that you can talk to you can listen to 

75.76 77.12 B: do things together 

77.49 80.78 A: right you need a lot of uh similar interests 

81.03 82.30 B: yeah 

82.09 84.61 A: [mn] yeah i just got married in march [laughter] 

84.18 89.22 B: [sigh] [laughter] oh man [laughter] so you're really new in this uh 

85.53 86.82 A: [laughter] 

89.03 91.42 A: oh it's my second time around [laughter] 

90.59 93.82 B: oh okay so what happened the first time 

93.63 102.29 A: um i guess we'd actually that brings up a good point i think communication is very key 'cause i didn't have very good communication in the first marriage 

102.83 108.18 A: so communication is definitely a key aspect to a good good relationship life partner 

108.34 114.23 B: [mn] yeah okay yeah that's right yeah if you ca- can't talk to the partner 

110.78 112.44 A: (( yeah )) 

114.76 117.07 B: (( you lose it very fast )) 

116.44 117.42 A: yes 

117.74 128.19 A: yeah i think uh as far as her and i were concerned we thought it was so good in the beginning that [sigh] we didn't talk about everything and then when little things became big things then it was too too late to fix 'em 

128.10 130.63 B: [sigh] yeah do do you have kids 

130.57 133.07 A: [mn] no luckily [mn] 

131.87 134.53 B: oh okay [laughter] i have two of them so oh 

134.67 139.79 B: eh and it's uh it er becomes much tougher when you have the kids 

139.55 141.39 A: right more of a challenge [laughter] 

141.12 145.88 B: (( more of a challenge y- y- yeah the responsibility )) 

145.93 153.68 B: education everything and and if you don't a- a- you don't have the friendship the communication you don't have the links between the two 

147.52 148.67 A: right 

153.68 154.90 A: right 

154.59 166.33 B: it it becomes e- even worse because er when you t- think about it the kids if if you're alone it it's okay but if you have the kids that's er makes the picture completely different 

165.79 170.02 A: right 'cause then you got a lot of your time is taken away by the kids and 

169.37 171.04 B: yeah 

170.75 172.28 A: a lot of your focus 

171.86 186.23 B: uh-huh actually you go from one er the the first shift is at work and then you add to the second one as you eh open the door at home [laughter] and you start your second shift 'til they they go to sleep 

180.74 182.85 A: [laughter] 

186.20 187.92 B: (( and uh even then )) 

188.02 194.30 B: during the night if they're sick or just they get up uh crying or something you have to wake up for them 

194.36 198.05 A: right so there's always something going on huh [mn] 

197.34 203.69 B: uh-huh yeah y- y- yeah you don't have a dull moment [laughter] so 

202.77 204.85 A: n- no time to relax [mn] 

204.22 210.36 B: (( no e- em not not really and e- e- even in the in during the evening when they )) 

210.47 217.48 B: (( after they go to sleep [laughter] you start eh eh cleaning around sort of setting things paying bills )) 

217.59 221.42 B: (( doing all the rest of the things that eh you can't do very well when they're awake )) 

222.07 223.76 A: right 

222.45 226.50 B: (( so yeah our whole life is uh very very full and )) 

228.07 233.35 A: yeah and i guess you face another challenge once they grow up and move out 'cause then you're back to being alone again [laughter] 

232.01 236.54 B: yeah [laughter] so then you you have this eh 

236.74 241.19 B: [mn] this empty time or working time or this hole in the middle [sigh] 

241.70 242.71 A: yeah 

242.03 246.14 B: so it brings it back to the friend or the partner 

246.36 248.06 A: right 

246.56 248.03 B: (( whatever you have )) 

248.77 255.76 A: yes so there's there's um communication and love and friendship i guess are what we're basically saying are the most important things [noise] 

256.08 260.55 B: (( there uh yeah and i- if you prioritize it eh at the beginning it's love )) 

260.82 264.26 B: and then at the beginning if you need you need a good er friendship 

264.73 269.72 B: and then eh y- you must es- establish a communication and the links talking er 

270.09 271.50 B: links between the two 

271.52 278.46 A: right yeah i guess i i have another challenge because my wife is chinese so there is a uh cultural difference as well [laughter] 

277.72 282.64 B: (( [cough] [mn] oh yeah [laughter] [mn] and you're you're born american )) 

282.54 283.47 A: yes 

283.29 287.13 B: (( and you from where are you from um texas )) 

286.90 288.29 A: uh philadelphia 

287.96 295.20 B: oh so i'm i'm in uh actually my uh i'm born in india but brought up in israel and i live in texas 

294.89 297.43 A: wow [laughter] 

295.33 300.95 B: [laughter] so so it's uh it's a lot of differences yeah 

300.37 302.55 A: right uh what is your wife 

302.41 310.12 B: she's eh she was brought up in israel and she actually uh she was born in israel and we are we are not together 

310.36 312.09 A: mhm 

312.04 313.73 B: (( but eh yeah there )) 

313.77 315.76 B: (( are you might say )) 

315.81 320.98 B: gap that also that uh that could be a problem sometimes 

317.47 318.37 A: yes 

321.36 328.36 A: yeah because uh if you if you don't if you're not brought up in the same way a lot of times you look at things differently 

327.40 334.48 B: yeah [laughter] and then that could be sometimes funny sometimes a very [laughter] very bad even 

334.42 335.34 A: yes 

334.59 341.65 B: yeah so something you do um as an american is okay for a chinese it could be very wrong 

341.43 344.15 A: very true [laughter] 

341.88 344.44 B: [laughter] yeah 

344.43 346.87 A: and vice versa [laughter] 

345.48 346.79 B: (( [laughter] oh yeah )) 

347.61 351.77 A: yeah that that's that's very true there's there's lots advantages 

352.19 356.45 A: but i i i do feel that communication is definitely one of the key issues [noise] 

356.63 358.08 B: yeah 

358.36 363.53 B: yeah [laughter] we thought er with the language uh differences when when we would translate from hebrew to english 

363.17 364.06 A: uh-huh 

363.62 367.71 B: it's sometimes in hebrew it's okay in english it's bad so 

367.08 368.80 A: right right [laughter] 

367.94 371.87 B: [laughter] so it could be the same thing with the chinese i don't know 

372.41 382.66 A: yeah that's true because there's a lot of words that she doesn't understand at this point that i take for granted that are that are every day words but it's not really something that she learned because she didn't grow up here [laughter] 

381.97 392.91 B: yeah and you know er i found a way that er er er talking to all americans as an israeli that came over here sometimes i say something and they don't it doesn't seem completely right to 

392.71 393.72 A: right 

393.17 395.57 B: raise the flag say what do you mean over here 

395.67 404.36 B: [laughter] i i don't want to be insulted and i don't want to insult i don't want anyone to get insult from me so i said okay if i said something wrong lets make 

396.26 397.16 A: yeah 

405.07 409.66 A: yeah y- you'd sometimes i think the way you say it they could take it the wrong way for sure 

405.25 406.21 B: [laughter] 

409.03 411.41 B: uh-huh yeah that's right [sigh] 

410.16 413.76 A: 'cause c- certain words can have more than one meaning 

413.85 419.10 A: [mn] and uh and when they become slang then they become more detrimental [laughter] 

416.82 418.74 B: (( [laughter] )) 

418.82 421.07 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

420.03 424.65 A: yeah that's true so ten minutes is a long time to talk about it uh [laughter] 

423.73 428.69 B: [laughter] yeah er actually we are almost eight minutes so it's that's not so bad [mn] 

428.86 432.07 A: that's not too bad so h- did you hear about this on the radio 

432.15 438.21 B: (( er no the- there is um uh to the recreation centre we have in plano )) 

438.27 439.56 B: (( there are actually )) 

439.87 449.23 B: very close to dallas texas so there are classes and you enter them and one was the one of them was the mystic er shopper 

449.31 454.96 A: mhm um i heard about it on the radio so i'm not sure where what one you're 

449.87 451.35 B: you know about it 

455.16 469.13 B: [sigh] so it's it's uh something that's er that you can be like a mystery shopper and you can em go into shops and everything and they don't know that you're coming to check them actually to test them 

468.17 469.27 A: oh okay 

469.20 472.86 B: so one of the things is that this er conversation is also the thing 

473.06 476.46 B: that you come need to come up and er talk about things 

476.13 477.03 A: (( right )) 

477.17 479.00 A: oh yes that that's where you go 

479.01 481.55 A: (( and they don't realise that you're )) 

481.58 483.43 A: being paid to be there 

483.63 487.11 B: yeah exactly yeah 

486.07 491.50 A: yeah i think i've heard about that and then you you rate them on how they served you as a customer [noise] 

491.97 496.42 B: yeah uh-huh yes and you have to go away fill out the survey after that 

496.60 498.68 B: (( fill out a lot of questions [sigh] )) 

498.75 500.26 A: interesting 

499.88 502.31 B: yeah [mn] so 

502.37 504.62 A: [mn] okay so uh 

504.37 509.05 B: so if we summarize our our conversation as the friendship communication eh 

509.62 511.30 B: (( yeah )) 

510.86 512.79 A: and of course love [laughter] 

513.18 515.79 B: love is the first thing yeah 

514.58 522.05 A: yeah for sure i mean that's what gets you together o- other well attraction wears off after a while so i guess you need all those other things to fall back on 

521.62 523.14 B: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

524.45 533.40 A: and i i'd i'd also feel that spending quality time together is very important because you can tend to get caught up in life and not spend the quality time with the person that you need to 

533.17 536.29 B: yeah and it er becomes very important when you have kids 

536.31 540.86 A: yeah i'm sure i'm i we're going to start trying in about two or three months so [laughter] 

537.09 537.93 B: yeah 

540.26 541.13 B: (( [laughter] oh )) 

541.15 548.11 B: oh good luck that's a b- that's a great challenge because it's a a a very beautiful thing to do 

547.94 549.63 A: right 

548.39 554.23 B: (( but very hard okay i'm telling you u- up front it's hard it's hard to have kids )) 

549.70 550.73 A: yes 

554.02 558.38 A: yeah i came from a family of ten so i know it can be rough [laughter] 

556.52 559.25 B: oh wow [laughter] ten kids 

558.92 559.89 A: yes 

559.48 560.52 B: wow 

560.74 563.29 B: uh that's that's unusual for americans 

562.93 564.53 A: yes it is 

563.65 565.21 B: (( [laughter] )) 

565.42 572.09 A: especially nowadays but you know that was back in the wh- i'm i'm thirty nine and my oldest sister's in her fifties so 

572.21 575.42 A: that was quite a long time ago that i that we were growing up 

575.75 577.13 B: (( yeah )) 

577.87 579.13 A: (( [sigh] yeah so )) 

577.95 579.12 B: (( [sigh] okay )) 

579.52 582.80 A: are we at ten minutes yet [laughter] 

580.75 588.78 B: (( [laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah i think it er my my timer says ten almost eleven minutes now )) 

588.62 595.54 A: [laughter] so are they specifically talking about they said life partner so i guess that could be anybody that could be any kind of a couple it doesn't necessarily have to be marriage 

595.35 596.65 B: (( er yeah mhm )) 

597.75 599.89 A: so i guess any kind of relationship requi-
