26.78 29.76 B: (( in a girl or [mn] i mean i think )) 

31.52 36.17 B: o- overall i mean obviously looks are always first looks always first you have to have some sort of appeal 

36.18 50.56 B: um physically but then i mean it's got to be deeper than that you know personality wise i mean you know you have to be able to [sigh] be comfortable enough to carry a conversation that that's just deeper than like an acquaintance conversation you know say and like they have to be [sigh] not like your partner but like your best friend 

36.54 37.48 A: yeah 

50.77 52.21 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

50.77 53.29 B: and i'm looking for someone like that you know s- where they can 

53.44 62.75 B: where it's it's some sort of like chemistry between you that goes deeper than even even like your your friends you know like your boys or whatever like it's de- it's deeper than that you know

80.92 82.03 A: right 

83.39 92.23 A: yeah i i think it's important that uh someone knows what they want they want to do with their life just uh rather than just living it you know i i 

83.83 84.79 B: (( but )) 

88.22 89.77 B: yeah yeah 

91.16 92.37 B: what about you though 

92.78 95.80 A: i think it's important to have someone that you can 

96.64 111.11 A: it it's uh kind of a personality thing but you know [mn] same basic comfort levels i mean you're living with this person so [sigh] you know if you're if you're comfortable with the house being dirty then the other person either needs to 

102.44 103.50 B: mhm 

111.34 114.43 A: [sigh] you it just can't get on their nerves you know 

113.49 114.45 B: yeah 

114.36 128.23 A: it's just a a certain sort of how type a are both people that sort of compatibility um and and of course you know a good personality and and it never hurts if she's really hot [sigh] um so

144.78 150.42 B: and all i mean see i think i don't really think my criteria at all will will ever change i think it's um 

150.60 163.54 B: and and like a lot of times it's kind of hard to put in words you know but you you kind of like see you see like the person the kind of person that you are are attracted to and th- and then you know you see the personality [sigh] and you kind of i think it's more of a feeling than it is you know like uh 

163.66 166.87 B: i spot that girl and that's my wife kind of thing you know yeah 

166.48 167.06 A: (( [sigh] ))

181.31 196.19 B: yeah yeah and if you got to a lot deeper than the looks looks is just like the first oh you passed the first test but yeah you know a few more to pass it's 'cause there there are a lot of good looking girls that you just i just can't stand [laughter] you know i mean you have to look at why [laughter] so 

182.69 183.25 A: (( [mn] )) 

188.59 189.68 A: yeah

235.64 244.92 B: (( i guess that was basically my criteria was just like you know all right first that she's good looking all right she's hot so that w- that was first but then like after that you know we talked to each other [sigh] kind of click in )) 

245.02 256.90 B: [sigh] and then you know we found out we had the same interests and [sigh] just you know [mn] one thing leads to another and [sigh] i think um those are more successful than being just like wow she's hot let me marry her you know 

256.90 258.79 A: yeah 

259.31 262.42 A: yeah the girl that i'm dating right now is just uh

271.17 271.77 B: (( yeah )) 

272.21 278.59 A: it on the surface level you know got all the qualities in her that you know would make a really good drinking buddy [sigh]

457.26 458.36 B: (( yeah )) 

458.79 472.61 B: i like in my personal experience like you just fells like the bar is just not the place to meet like the girlfriend type of girl like e you can meet the the one night stand you can meet you know those all those type of girls but like the one you really really want to spend time with like those type of girls aren't there

479.61 480.60 B: (( i guess ))

487.20 489.19 B: in a random place like you know 

489.18 499.20 B: i'm going to mail something and then you know i see her on my way to my car or something like that you know like it not not really going out to a party and you know and looking for a girl and seeing her there you know

523.96 531.49 A: i dunno i'm just kind of out of ideas it's just like you know i've always heard that the best pla- uh the best way to meet girls is like through your friends [sigh] 

531.53 539.27 A: but what happens when none of your friends know any girls either i'm an engineering student by the way i think that kind of explains a little bit about it 

531.66 532.49 B: uh-huh 

536.78 537.58 B: (( oh )) 

538.66 541.41 B: (( [laughter] you do engineering okay ))
