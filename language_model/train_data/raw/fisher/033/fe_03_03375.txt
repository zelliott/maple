111.97 112.97 B: yes 

112.36 117.25 A: and i'm his best friend and i think that 

118.06 121.78 A: i don't think you can be very very good friends without the values 

121.99 122.96 B: right 

122.39 123.59 A: um 

123.63 125.48 B: priorities [laughter] 

124.84 126.55 A: yes yes 

125.52 126.90 B: um we 

127.60 128.83 B: we um 

129.12 131.89 B: had to get our priorities straight before the kids came 

131.68 133.76 A: [laughter] 

132.33 137.99 B: [laughter] and now that there's two kids you have to make sure that they stay straight be- 

137.07 139.26 A: yes yes well we're 

140.66 143.87 A: our kids the youngest one was 

144.53 145.51 A: (( he's six )) 

146.39 150.61 A: well we married in eighty six but we lived together 

150.81 155.87 A: for a good seven or eight years first so we've been together a long time 

155.22 156.92 B: yeah 

156.15 158.34 A: and our youngest 

158.46 163.25 A: she's not mine but she was barely a year old when we started living together 

162.95 164.25 B: oh 

163.67 165.14 A: and so 

165.29 166.37 A: um 

166.45 167.73 A: you know they've 

167.75 169.37 B: and he had custody 

169.37 172.34 A: no he didn't have custody he had joint custody 

171.75 172.80 B: okay 

172.46 177.03 A: and i had sole custody of my son we have no clue where his father is 

176.79 178.32 B: (( [mn] )) 

177.75 182.49 A: so he's raised my son and i've helped to raise his girls 

182.10 183.91 B: isn't that wonderful 

183.31 185.09 A: yeah so 

184.08 185.85 B: that way they all get good parents 

185.79 187.87 A: yes yes 

187.00 188.98 B: i think that's fantastic 

188.30 195.57 A: right so yeah i think values friendship i think friendship outlasts everything 

195.76 196.99 B: i do too 

196.63 198.28 A: (( and you know )) 

198.74 202.21 A: just the caring part of it you have to care for each other 

202.90 206.04 A: if you don't have that nothing's gonna hold you together 

207.96 212.75 A: because my husband tried that with his ex wife 

212.90 215.43 A: staying together for the kids and 

214.81 216.60 B: [noise] and that's just not 

216.14 217.46 A: doesn't work 

217.19 218.46 B: right 

217.80 219.32 A: nobody's happy 

218.74 223.48 B: nobody's happy and the and the role model they get for a marriage for their future is just 

223.69 225.03 B: not right 

224.40 226.40 A: right right 

225.80 227.16 B: and not healthy 

226.80 227.98 A: yes 

227.49 229.99 B: so yeah i think um 

231.05 233.23 B: (( friendship is a bigger a )) 

234.61 236.55 B: big issue for us has been 

236.69 239.70 B: religion and it sounds so silly that 

239.98 244.72 B: he was my husband was raised very catholic and i was raised very lutheran they're both christian 

244.26 245.36 A: uh-huh 

245.32 250.84 B: and they're very close very similar but it's been a huge issue just because of our extended families 

250.24 251.58 A: mhm 

251.17 256.66 B: and so i think that was another issue that we really had to resolve before 

257.18 260.07 B: i mean not before we got married but before we um 

260.06 264.04 A: had children right well we lucked out there we're not 

260.09 261.41 B: had a family 

264.13 265.63 A: he's jewish 

265.72 269.40 A: i'm christian neither one of us really practice 

269.27 272.53 B: and your families were not [laughter] 

271.24 273.69 A: my our families well he 

273.78 277.34 A: he converted to judaism when he got married the first time 

277.48 281.15 A: and so his girls were raised jewish 

280.52 281.50 B: uh-huh 

281.48 286.50 A: and um his ex mother in law 

286.79 290.35 A: likes me [laughter] 

288.01 291.98 B: [laughter] and that goes a long way 

291.46 294.95 A: yes it does sometimes she likes me better than her own daughter 

295.06 298.89 A: so you know she has included us in 

299.26 300.27 A: um 

302.17 308.18 A: like us having i don't know if you are familiar with the jewish religion but having a sater and stuff like that 

307.17 308.99 B: uh-huh oh that's neat 

308.48 309.69 A: um 

310.90 316.04 A: and we've celebrated both hanukkah and christmas 

316.28 320.00 A: things like that so we've been able to blend that very well 

319.30 324.34 B: that's nice because it can it could be [laughter] very hairy 

323.58 329.38 A: it can be it can be but everybody's tolerant of everybody else and um 

329.78 332.04 A: actually the daughters are 

332.81 334.92 A: practice more than 

335.64 341.66 A: my son or i do which makes it not easier but 

341.67 345.46 A: you know they're tolerant of us and we're tolerant of them and 

344.84 348.55 B: so maybe that would be another [laughter] issue tolerance 

346.36 347.37 A: yes 

347.79 349.66 A: tolerance yes 

349.80 363.12 B: and even even tolerance for families about other issues as well [laughter] because at least here in the bible belt [mn] these families have a lot to do with these extended families are uh 

353.51 355.45 A: right right 

363.66 365.49 B: [cough] right in their face 

364.99 366.95 A: [laughter] 

366.04 367.13 B: at all times 

367.22 368.34 A: uh-huh 

367.35 371.20 B: with their beliefs and their views so that's been a big 

369.02 370.77 A: yeah yeah 

371.95 374.35 B: um issue for us as well 

374.37 378.69 A: well you know it's strange because i was raised lutheran 

379.12 382.86 A: but went to a a methodist church 

381.28 382.43 B: [noise] 

383.87 390.51 A: my my father was catholic my father and my grandmother were catholic my mother and her family were lutheran 

390.72 393.69 A: but again nobody fought over it 

395.25 399.99 A: the way it can yes the way it can happen so 

395.36 396.92 B: now you're lucky 

397.12 399.03 B: [laughter] 

399.66 401.28 B: you were lucky 

400.83 403.55 A: yeah and i think that's probably where 

403.90 406.47 A: you know live and let live comes for me 

406.13 416.31 B: well and it's it's kind of um ironic that all of our ancestors both of our grandparents came straight from germany and all of our grandparents came straight from germany 

416.64 419.61 B: and straight from the same area of germany 

420.01 423.40 B: but i think there there was such a division between the two 

423.05 424.11 A: uh-huh 

423.42 426.39 B: that they just brought it here and they had this 

424.66 425.66 A: right 

426.55 434.41 B: you know they would've probably rather i married someone outside of christianity [laughter] rather than a catholic 

433.80 436.33 A: [laughter] 

435.26 439.15 B: which is you know now i can laugh about it but at the time it was really annoying 

438.68 443.76 A: yes yes well it can get in the way it definitely can get in the way 

439.34 440.10 B: (( so )) 

443.84 448.87 B: and you know when i turned about thirty i decided we'll forget you all and we're on our own thing so 

448.30 455.11 A: right right well you have to you have to create your own family and live the way you think is best for your family 

448.98 450.46 B: (( [laughter] )) 

454.73 455.74 B: right 

455.77 456.61 A: so 

456.34 459.32 B: and thank goodness it's been too painful to do so 

458.74 459.70 A: yes 

460.20 462.58 A: yes we've lucked out that way so 

462.33 465.52 B: (( yes [cough] so have your um )) 

466.68 469.03 B: does your spouse travel or is he home 

469.14 473.55 A: he used to travel a lot um he's home now 

473.57 476.39 A: he works long hours he's in publishing 

476.55 482.52 A: and um when he's up against he's in the publishing end of it he's not a writer 

476.74 478.20 B: oh yeah 

482.53 487.93 A: so when he's up against deadlines i don't see him for months on time but uh 

487.94 491.03 A: then other times you know the rest of the time he's 

491.09 494.50 A: home at like three or four or five o'clock during the day so 

494.17 495.57 B: that's wonderful 

494.98 497.39 A: it's good yeah and i work out of my own 

497.43 499.50 A: office in my house so 

500.54 504.59 A: we kind of when we have free time we're able to spend it together 

504.27 505.86 B: that's nice 

505.21 508.17 A: and we much prefer being with each other 

508.68 510.51 B: over other people 

509.02 509.79 A: i mean 

509.88 516.56 A: right i mean we have friends that we do things with and some of them are on a consistent basis and some of them are on 

512.00 512.90 B: right 

516.72 519.00 A: an an occasional basis but 

519.21 523.00 A: if we go without seeing anybody else that's fine too 

522.74 525.19 B: [laughter] that's exactly where we're at 

525.45 531.79 B: you know when when time is scarce you'd just rather not waste the time and just be together instead 

529.53 530.76 A: mhm 

531.48 535.19 A: [lipsmack] right right so does your husband travel 

535.01 540.34 B: he um actually just turned down an an opportunity 

540.90 548.31 B: quite a bit more money traveling but um we just decided it wasn't the time we have a one year old and a three year old 

546.07 547.29 A: mhm 

547.82 548.72 A: (( ah )) 

548.46 556.15 B: and um i might just absolutely go nuts if he did [laughter] so for our sanity we decided to 

552.24 557.73 A: (( [laughter] )) 

556.26 560.68 B: not going to have as much money and have more time together 

559.77 561.53 A: yes yes 

560.97 563.20 B: so no he he's at home 

563.32 566.48 B: every day pretty much three four five o'clock 

565.86 567.67 A: yeah well that's good 

566.95 569.84 B: so it's very nice and then i um 

568.05 569.23 A: yeah 

570.31 574.87 B: i teach at the college level so i can kind of create my own schedule 

572.38 573.28 A: oh 

574.43 575.53 A: uh-huh 

575.45 578.82 B: depending on the semester and right now when they're 

579.02 584.14 B: so little um i'm working mostly in the evenings and teaching evening classes but 

583.54 587.96 A: oh good so then your husband can be home with them yeah 

586.64 587.60 B: right 

587.96 592.01 B: but um sometimes it doesn't work out that way and 

592.14 594.57 B: we get to hire the babysitter and all of that but 

593.96 595.05 A: right 

594.97 599.70 B: and that's okay too 'cause then we have more time as a family at night i but
