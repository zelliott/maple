12.00 12.93 B: right 

12.96 21.80 A: (( trying to think [laughter] you know what i think the best quality is that makes sense that makes a lot of sense [laughter] yeah yeah well that makes sense [laughter] that that's true i understand that that would get that probably would get boring i've got a girlfriend that you know we've been living together for uh like four years now or something like that uh only real serious girlfriend i've ever had and so however she she it's a lot like what you )) 

20.11 21.23 B: okay 

21.87 25.74 B: well i mean i'm married myself so i've got a fairly good amount of um 

26.14 27.91 B: experience in this field 

28.22 29.31 B: um 

29.70 36.06 B: you know i i think it's really important to find somebody that you have a good common ground with 

36.18 41.89 B: um you know at least somewhat of agreeance on 

42.53 48.43 B: you know philosophy and way of life and those sorts of things um 

46.64 49.04 A: (( had mentioned where uh [sigh] you know it's uh you )) 

48.85 53.39 B: you know i i personally don't think that you should get somebody 

53.56 57.12 B: that is your you know complete you know 

57.92 70.46 B: identical twin you know because you know my wife is always saying how she thinks i need somebody more submissive and you know i wouldn't want anything like that because a little bit of spice in life to me 

66.07 66.63 A: (( know )) 

69.44 71.52 A: (( we got we got )) 

70.78 76.79 B: uh you know it gets pretty damn boring if my wife just said yes dear to everything i said 

71.79 73.03 A: (( some things that you )) 

76.26 79.18 A: (( know certainly are in )) 

79.47 82.67 A: (( common but there's it's not it's not anything where everytime i say )) 

83.09 84.87 A: (( something she immediately agrees )) 

85.38 86.85 A: (( with it or anything )) 

86.96 88.61 A: (( like that )) 

89.89 91.02 A: (( and )) 

91.74 95.97 A: (( i guess that's why we've you know been together for a while )) 

96.63 102.10 A: (( now and it seems to seems to work out pretty well you know compatibility and like you said uh the piece )) 

102.32 109.33 A: (( that adds the uh kind of flavor or spice to it [laughter] so it's not like you're talking to a mirror yeah )) 

109.73 112.73 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah yeah that's true )) 

112.80 114.03 A: (( oh no that's )) 

114.78 116.79 A: (( certainly true there's uh i i think the divorce rate up for )) 

116.99 125.51 A: (( fifty percent or something like that now it's just awful [noise] yeah yeah that makes sense it it i think it's probably a natural thing where )) 

123.80 124.70 B: yeah 

126.76 128.48 B: [noise] and also the uh 

128.53 131.64 B: you know one of the big things is you just have to uh 

131.76 137.24 B: [noise] you know you have to have somebody that is kind of a level head you know because 

137.87 144.48 B: you know because it's humanity you can get into fights so easily especially when you're in such close quarters with somebody 

138.11 138.91 A: (( you )) 

144.63 146.69 A: (( kind of got to struggle there )) 

144.68 145.97 B: and uh 

146.33 152.84 B: you know especially you know it's just as much in a relationship and in a marriage as well especially if 

153.06 155.13 B: you have to have somebody to 

155.34 158.02 B: is wanting to work with you 

158.15 161.71 B: you know 'cause it's so easy just to have a big fight and throw everything away 

162.00 164.13 B: and a lot of people do that these days 

164.09 166.88 A: (( not struggle but you gotta work on it to keep it )) 

164.27 165.23 B: (( and i know )) 

166.83 168.98 B: (( yeah you know relationships can )) 

167.09 171.70 A: (( kind of keep it going keep it interesting and that ma- that makes a lot of sense i mean i i know )) 

170.07 170.89 B: yeah 

170.94 178.21 B: you know and it's the whole of humanity where people you know you can't help but kind of get tired you know 

177.67 179.69 A: (( that there there've been times )) 

178.48 188.96 B: i tell you once you get married it's like well i'm never going to be able to go out with another woman again and you know for the most part i'm fine with that but i mean you get complacent you get to where you 

189.02 193.14 B: you will take the other person for granted and i don't think you can really help 

193.11 200.34 A: (( where i've stopped and thought well you know it's like 'wow' this is [laughter] you know this is the only girl i've been dating )) 

193.80 194.63 B: that 

201.03 206.11 A: (( for four years i haven't talked to anybody else and you know it's but it uh you know we we )) 

206.40 216.16 A: (( have our ups and downs but it works out yeah you just got to have the uh you know the i think it's very important to have somebody that you )) 

216.38 217.35 B: (( i )) 

216.54 218.99 A: (( know just doesn't )) 

219.58 223.09 A: (( tell you it's more important than you know just this one fight we had )) 

220.05 220.96 B: (( think )) 

223.06 225.03 B: you just have to uh 

226.26 231.25 B: (( [noise] oh yeah well )) 

231.48 233.77 B: (( you just uh it )) 

233.95 235.06 A: yeah 

234.46 236.69 B: gets kind of harder when you get two kids 

237.38 238.38 B: (( and uh )) 

238.58 241.16 B: not a very good uh 

241.36 242.88 B: babysitter circle 

242.93 250.04 A: [laughter] i can imagine it and it it seems to become more complicated [laughter] it probably does 

243.18 245.53 B: you know [laughter] the uh 

246.31 247.76 B: that fact becomes 

248.99 250.30 B: yeah you know 

250.33 255.11 B: that's where it comes in more and more useful as you know those times come by but 

255.31 258.53 B: uh you know there i think there's too many people that 

258.63 260.53 B: get [noise] together and stay together 

260.58 261.85 B: that uh 

262.29 263.59 B: that really don't 

263.64 265.63 B: have enough in common or 

266.03 267.83 B: you know like if somebody 

267.88 276.18 B: drinks heavily and the other person doesn't i mean that's i i wouldn't think that would ever be a successful relationship because 

276.55 278.31 B: you know i mean that's 

276.76 278.12 A: that makes sense 

278.32 282.81 B: it it's definitely some time down the road going to cause some kind of problem 

282.49 291.83 A: yeah you're gonna run into something certainly not maybe not now but when the when the excitement and the newness wears off and you realize that all they do is 

292.03 296.09 A: drink every day and the other person doesn't then i i could see how that would be a problem 

296.53 302.66 B: right and it's you know it's the the biggest is just finding you know i don't think there is any perfect 

297.12 297.93 A: (( [laughter] )) 

302.84 304.33 B: model to a 

304.66 307.45 B: uh life partner it would be just 

307.84 310.35 B: you know somebody that fits your particular need 

310.28 313.43 A: yeah uh-huh that makes s- that makes a lot of sense too 

313.62 316.82 A: so depending on who you are you may need somebody who's 

316.91 319.55 A: like you were saying more yeah more with 

319.90 322.82 A: of an opposite or somebody who's more of a 

323.38 329.00 A: you know more close to you or more submissive or something depending on who you are but [sigh] 

326.72 327.62 B: (( [noise] )) 

328.96 340.17 A: i i don't i don't know that there'd ever be anybody [laughter] that would well actually i suppose there probably are people who need somebody who's just a mirror of themselves and i guess if that's what works for the both of them then 

340.27 341.53 A: yeah that would 

341.71 348.94 A: you know i certainly wouldn't question that but um wouldn't work for me i need somebody to argue with me once in a while [laughter] 

348.73 351.53 B: right by that i mean that get into the whole 

351.64 353.23 B: co-dependency type 

353.63 354.63 A: yeah 

353.67 355.82 B: type deal and i don't think that's 

355.91 357.62 B: i think that's more of a 

357.83 362.69 B: um addiction than really uh kind of a chosen life partner 

359.45 360.98 A: (( [noise] )) 

362.69 365.81 A: yeah no that that's true [noise] just kind of somebody that's 

365.88 369.57 A: there not really the relationship that's 

370.25 375.08 A: you know people think about when they talk about a relationship probably kind of a different sort of relationship [sigh] 

375.95 377.28 A: that makes sense 

376.04 389.55 B: oh yeah one you know and it does uh you know people joking you know say that being married doesn't make a difference but i'll tell you right now it does i mean i knew my wife ten years before we got married and uh 

388.48 389.34 A: yeah 

390.50 393.81 B: you know i don't know what it is but it it changes 

393.99 407.44 A: that's see now that's good for me to know because [laughter] nobody i know is married and you know i'm sitting here in this relationship and you know it's you know i i love her and i certainly will get married at some point i imagine but you know i 

394.15 394.94 B: you know 

395.04 395.97 B: and 

407.63 412.79 A: don't know when that's going to be and so it it's good information for me [laughter] to have 

409.93 411.30 B: oh i mean you're 

412.10 416.34 B: i mean what you see now is what you get i'm sure you know because 

414.85 416.22 A: yeah yeah 

416.75 424.12 B: you know but i mean there's there's things that go into it and you know when you get into you know houses and cars and 

423.59 425.21 A: yeah 

424.57 430.24 B: kids and daycare and [laughter] you know actually i think it's the added 

428.14 430.99 A: really really become a family unit then 

430.75 435.47 B: yeah i think it's the added pressure that that makes it so difficult but uh 

435.69 447.66 B: you know i mean if you have if you have a life partner that you know one of the biggest things you know and that's probably is my highest is somebody that you know because everybody's life 

435.75 437.06 A: that makes sense 

447.64 449.00 A: oh yeah yeah 

447.88 453.56 B: i've lived with roommates that after a year we were at each other's throats you know 

452.25 455.14 A: oh that i've had that too [laughter] 

454.59 456.40 B: yeah you can't help it when you're 

456.54 461.70 B: you know that's part of humanity is you know it's like a huge claw you know [laughter] 

459.42 470.98 A: yeah and being being that close to people no i understand i think something something once on the t._v. or at school sometime where they had some study about rats and when they 

462.20 463.03 B: yeah 

471.05 476.66 A: got more than a certain number of them in a you know small location they fought a lot more [sigh] 

476.99 477.94 B: right 

477.07 480.18 A: i think i think people are a lot like that too [sigh] [noise] 

480.55 483.19 B: oh definitely you know and and people 

483.42 484.59 B: you know they 

484.60 488.35 B: they kind of you know especially when they're younger they just throw that away 

488.26 489.25 A: yeah 

488.36 490.60 B: before they kind of realize that 

490.65 493.87 B: you might have thrown away something good because 

493.99 497.89 B: it really doesn't get any it won't be any different with anybody 

497.82 500.97 A: yeah yeah no that's true that's a good point [sigh] [noise] 

498.10 499.13 B: you know 

500.77 511.90 B: and like i said it's you know i mean and i do it too i mean that's you know i need my wife to kind of say well he's upset he's had a bad day you know i have to let him blow off some steam 

509.68 511.75 A: yeah 

512.46 513.33 B: you know 

512.48 515.73 A: yeah somebody who can understand that that makes sense 

514.96 520.68 B: then you know there's some times where she just needs to say okay that's enough just shut the hell up you know [laughter] 

519.61 524.38 A: [laughter] i get i get that too from my girlfriend [laughter] 

521.67 522.84 B: and you know 

524.29 530.21 B: yeah you know and i and i like that you know i wouldn't want a woman that would not feel 

528.72 531.23 A: (( yeah )) 

530.55 532.94 B: she has the power to do that 

532.36 536.67 A: yeah an active partner in the relationship rather than just somebody who's come in 

535.82 536.66 B: yeah 

536.75 539.37 A: like window dressing or you know 

539.05 539.92 B: yeah 

540.13 542.46 B: i don't know that i've told her that you 

541.81 543.30 A: (( [laughter] yes )) 

542.48 543.12 B: (( know )) 

543.15 546.83 B: [laughter] it's a little more touchy when i tell her that you know she'll 

543.62 545.24 A: yeah not that's true 

546.22 549.25 A: [laughter] 

547.27 551.00 B: be a lot a lot more well placed than when she does that to me you know 

550.80 561.37 A: yeah well it's although it's i think its good that you know you find someone who can understand when it's you know what is okay and what's not [laughter] you know 

560.72 562.11 B: (( um right )) 

561.46 568.12 A: telling somebody shut the hell up versus you know if that if that would be something that would bother them [laughter] you know because of whatever reason 

568.48 569.37 A: (( you know )) 

568.95 574.00 B: oh yeah i mean that's the kind of thing that that you find out over time and that's the kind of thing that will 

572.84 573.77 A: yeah 

574.35 576.25 B: you know i mean you'll find 

576.13 577.40 A: yeah 

576.83 577.57 B: (( hello )) 

577.61 578.35 B: oh 

578.16 579.06 A: yeah 

578.39 588.59 B: i mean you'll find as you you get more into your resh- relationship i mean those things do kind of happen you get a little less sensitive and you get a little 

589.05 591.01 B: you know to where you don't 

591.36 593.86 B: kind of walk on egg shells as much 

593.78 595.02 A: yeah that's 

594.04 595.90 B: (( but i think that's good )) 

595.53 598.52 A: oh it's i i think so too that's certainly true i
