0.57 2.36 A: carolie gomman 

1.99 4.19 B: uh larry chambers [sigh] 

4.50 6.89 B: and uh would you like to go first 

7.02 8.39 A: (( [lipsmack] uh sure )) 

8.41 11.75 B: okay what is that you'd be looking for in a life partner 

11.84 13.66 A: [sigh] um [lipsmack] 

14.06 15.65 A: someone who 

15.79 17.88 A: values education 

17.79 18.86 B: yes 

18.00 24.43 A: [lipsmack] uh someone who values um emotional stability 

24.78 26.03 A: (( [sigh] uh )) 

25.59 26.56 B: (( [cough] yes )) 

26.59 34.77 A: where has a very strong work ethic someone [sigh] who can be trusted um someone who can be loyal 

35.86 38.86 A: [lipsmack] and someone who can communicate well 

40.18 42.71 B: well those are all very good qualities 

43.38 44.30 B: uh 

44.95 54.85 B: uh of course you're a female and i'm a male so we'd probably be looking for a few things [laughter] differently but uh i think the first thing i would be looking 

50.26 51.56 A: (( right [laughter] mhm )) 

55.54 58.13 B: in a life's partner uh 

58.21 62.18 B: would be honesty and sincerity 

61.89 62.83 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

62.79 66.49 B: uh because if you can't trust somebody 

66.52 71.76 B: there's no point in being with them so you have to feel that they're honest and sincere 

72.06 74.96 B: [sigh] uh about you or you couldn't trust 

75.13 78.02 B: them and um 

78.38 83.83 B: a lot of people i think men too more than women [sigh] go by uh 

83.95 94.43 B: physical appearance [sigh] and uh that's important only up to a point at least it is for me [sigh] i think what a person uh 

94.99 98.44 B: is is a lot more than just a physical appearance 

98.78 101.42 B: i think uh someone uh as uh 

101.63 103.80 B: honest and uh 

104.35 107.46 B: well all the virtues that you were talking about but [sigh] 

107.53 112.49 B: honesty is the main thing because there's so many people out there today playing games [laughter] 

112.25 113.39 A: right 

113.24 117.22 B: and uh i'm no doubt a little bit older than you are 

117.00 117.88 A: uh-huh 

117.39 118.70 B: but uh 

119.31 123.51 B: that ch- that also changes what you're looking for in someone too 

123.48 124.44 A: right 

123.91 138.56 B: as you go through life and you get a little bit older now i'm older so i wouldn't be looking for the same things in a partner that uh i'm fifty years old at my age [sigh] that i was when i was twenty 

134.15 135.07 A: mhm 

138.21 139.10 A: right 

138.81 140.18 B: (( [sigh] so )) 

140.24 146.13 B: uh along with everything else as you get older that would change too i'm sure but um 

144.53 145.46 A: mhm 

147.06 154.19 B: [cough] [sigh] reasonably attractive but more importantly that they had a good heart and that they were a good person you 

154.02 154.91 A: right 

154.86 161.08 B: know you have to look for somebody that is decent and kind and [sigh] uh 

161.36 165.90 B: well with me they'd have to love children and animals [laughter] 

164.31 165.49 A: mhm 

165.70 174.94 A: [laughter] right [sigh] well i think i think appearance say something about a person and [sigh] i i think um the partner has to 

166.24 168.02 B: (( [laughter] [sigh] )) 

175.06 176.43 A: [sigh] um 

176.71 179.86 A: you know enjoy and appreciate what they're looking at 

180.16 189.56 A: like like i i don't think someone should be someone in spite of the fact that they're this or they're that [sigh] if they're s- if they're not comfortable with it 

188.93 190.79 B: true that's true 

189.62 194.24 A: [sigh] um 'cause i think everybody needs to listen to their personal threshold 

194.20 195.81 B: oh absolutely 

194.95 196.41 A: yeah [laughter] 

196.05 199.53 B: well i don't know how old you are but that's pretty uh 

199.56 202.32 B: pretty astute for someone your age i'm guessing 

201.14 203.75 A: mhm i'm i'm thirty years old 

203.17 205.94 B: oh okay then you are a little bit older too 

203.97 204.91 A: (( yeah )) 

205.22 211.99 A: [cough] yeah my voice is very very uh frou frou so i sound actually probably much younger than 

207.90 208.46 B: (( [sigh] )) 

211.56 215.19 B: i was guessing like um early twenties yeah 

212.29 214.11 A: i actually am [laughter] 

214.57 221.19 A: yeah i'm a kindergarten teacher so i have a good voice for my for my occupation but [laughter] [sigh] um 

218.52 223.40 B: well great yeah the children probably love you [laughter] [laughter] 

221.48 228.87 A: [laughter] [sigh] but i think i think so a person's personality really comes out in the way that they look too 

228.58 230.93 B: [sigh] oh yeah 

228.69 239.01 A: [sigh] and i like i focus so heavily for some reason on mannerisms i'm not really sure why but [sigh] um it i i think it says a lot 

236.57 238.34 B: mannerisms or 

238.44 239.80 B: or manners 

239.44 250.42 A: [sigh] man- mannerisms in other words um [lipsmack] [sigh] the way someone shakes your hand says a lot about who they are and s- they way someone carries themselves 

244.62 246.13 B: [sigh] oh yeah 

249.77 251.15 B: absolutely 

250.21 256.20 A: in a room w- you know filled with people they know versus don't know [sigh] that sort of thing mhm 

254.07 255.28 B: [cough] true 

255.76 268.58 B: [sigh] but there again we're getting into this area of where i'm older than you certainly but you're [sigh] a little bit older too so you are looking for things that are coming from within 

268.44 269.33 A: right 

268.76 273.44 B: where a young girl is just looking at somebody that they think is cute you know [laughter] 

272.25 274.56 A: absolutely absolutely 

273.79 277.95 B: [sigh] so yeah so that all changes i think it all [noise] changes with age 

278.00 280.69 B: i know it did for me and um 

281.15 288.85 B: uh i'm just back into the uh dating game my wife passed a year and a half ago 

288.49 289.84 A: oh okay 

289.28 293.73 B: and so this is like all new to me [laughter] i've never 

292.59 296.07 A: were you married in your twenties thirties forties 

294.75 296.99 B: i was married when i was eighteen 

296.79 298.01 A: oh wow 

297.78 300.49 B: and we were married for thirty five years 

300.64 301.77 A: wow 

301.07 304.36 B: and i've never been single [laughter] 

303.49 305.13 A: yeah right 

304.53 310.51 B: you know so this is all new to me and you really do have to ask yourself [sigh] a lot of questions 

310.56 312.97 B: you know that you never had to ask before 

312.57 313.63 A: right 

313.17 314.82 B: (( you know because uh [lipsmack] )) 

315.12 322.43 B: i don't know that i'm really even ready to start dating yet [sigh] but i have been asked to go out a few times and uh [sigh] 

322.47 324.38 B: i went [sigh] uh 

324.88 327.21 B: and they were very nice uh women 

326.74 327.77 A: mhm 

327.28 332.85 B: [sigh] but i guess i'm just not ready yet i just [laughter] feel like i'm cheating [laughter] [laughter] [sigh] 

330.63 331.77 A: right 

332.02 334.99 A: do you are you are you the the um [sigh] 

335.45 339.90 A: the go getter in the relationship or are you more passive 

340.84 354.07 B: i guess i well i've never dated you know i've never been single so like the one woman finally said you know i'm asking you to go out and i said oh [sigh] 'cause i didn't [sigh] catch it [laughter] you know 

343.59 344.50 A: right 

352.87 354.28 A: right right 

353.90 362.24 B: i'm just i g- i maybe i'm kind of stupid [laughter] i don't know [laughter] but like i just didn't catch it because i'm not thinking like that yet you know 

356.70 358.62 A: [laughter] 

361.36 362.40 A: right 

362.29 364.34 B: but i have thought 

364.44 376.07 B: to myself you know [sigh] if i do meet somebody that i care to i don't mean to rush out and get married again but i mean that i want to go out with what what i [sigh] i wouldn't be looking for anybody 

371.32 372.12 A: right 

375.91 380.49 B: too terribly young [laughter] and uh [cough] 

377.33 379.47 A: right right right right 

380.78 389.54 B: so there's another factor age uh comes back around too because i wouldn't be comfortable with somebody younger than either one of my children 

389.12 389.98 A: right 

389.60 391.84 B: you know i couldn't go that round [sigh] 

391.13 392.15 A: right 

391.86 399.52 B: and uh reasonably attractive of course that's goes without saying but looks are not the everything 

396.19 397.31 A: mhm 

398.88 399.77 A: right 

399.56 401.16 B: definitely not 

400.89 401.75 A: right 

401.69 416.25 B: and uh i think a person's personality and like you said how they conduct themselves and how [sigh] their poise [cough] and how they act like you said in a crowd and are they comfortable with people and that means a lot too 

408.57 410.15 A: mhm mhm 

413.63 414.52 A: right 

415.95 421.51 A: right and if a woman can pull herself together and go out and look fabulous no matter 

421.57 426.49 A: [sigh] you know how how tall or thin or fat she is i think says a lot too 

426.03 428.14 B: [sigh] oh absolutely 

426.59 437.47 A: because then that person has enough [sigh] i i think i think intelligence to [laughter] sort of wear what's appropriate versus not appropriate and [laughter] 

428.26 429.08 B: (( [cough] )) 

433.19 434.49 B: (( [sigh] yes )) 

435.39 436.19 B: (( mm )) 

437.26 442.79 B: absolutely i mean i it'd be kind of hard to be serious about somebody that was an airhead 

442.19 443.53 A: right right 

442.86 446.90 B: that might be amusing for a little while but i myself think that would get old 

446.33 448.43 A: [laughter] right [laughter] right 

447.06 448.06 B: (( you know )) 

448.07 449.42 B: and um 

449.77 455.30 B: [lipsmack] i totally agree with you [sigh] a person it doesn't matter if you're fat or skinny or what 

455.21 466.30 B: i've seen some women uh that were just beautifully well groomed and made such a great appearance [sigh] and if you wanted to be unkind you could say well now aren't they heavy 

465.70 466.62 A: right 

466.26 475.90 B: but yet you didn't even notice that they had overall look you know they groomed their makeup their hair [sigh] they had a a very nice outfit on 

470.48 471.67 A: that's right 

476.08 485.13 B: [sigh] and yeah [cough] that does mean a lot but how about women do women [sigh] look for men to be well groomed is that an important issue 

477.38 478.23 A: right 

484.50 485.78 A: (( [sigh] um )) 

486.28 489.47 A: i think the majority of women want that 

489.53 497.75 A: and you know there are those women out there who want the motorcycle man with the eighteen tattoos and the m- the hair mullet [sigh] um [mn] 

496.40 498.58 B: yes [laughter] 

497.77 509.92 A: but you know i [mn] at least in my circles i really have found that [sigh] women really like the dressed in timberlake look even women who are my age [sigh] and they 

508.46 509.69 B: really 

509.94 516.21 A: n- don't necessarily date that look but they like the kind of high maintenance man [lipsmack] 

512.24 513.19 B: uh-huh 

515.54 516.83 B: (( oh really )) 

516.21 527.56 A: and [sigh] my sister in law dated a man who would spend two hours in the mirror every single day and i d- [sigh] i just don't think i could marry someone quite like that it's [noise] 

527.30 528.55 B: well that's 

527.94 532.30 A: it's a little to vain for me it's a little too much 

528.95 534.92 B: that's a little bit too much yeah [laughter] but i just wondered [cough] 

532.41 546.47 A: it's a little too much but my husband uh it's funny because he lives in tee shirts and this past year he bought some very nice uh clothing because he's doing clinics in vet school so he had to look appropriate 

546.14 547.05 B: uh-huh 

546.31 547.76 A: and he just looks 

547.64 562.44 A: as handsome as ever in these other clothes but i was [sigh] totally used to the [sigh] tee shirts and jeans because he would just go to class every day but now that he's dressing nicer [sigh] it's it's a refreshing change [laughter] [laughter] so i enjoy it [laughter] 

556.89 558.12 B: mhm 

559.08 561.38 B: and you like it do you like that 

561.59 573.29 B: yeah [sigh] well that's great [sigh] uh and your husband's studying to be a vet that's wonderful i love animals i just well i have two dogs two cats and i just inherited a bird [laughter] 

566.50 567.45 A: (( yeah )) 

567.70 568.64 A: yes 

572.07 575.63 A: oh that's great [laughter] we have two cats and a guinea pig 

575.44 576.97 B: oh my 

575.90 582.22 A: 'cause we're in an apartment so once we get the house we'll get a dog too [laughter] but [laughter] we'll have a whole farm soon [sigh] 

579.46 581.29 B: [laughter] 

581.31 583.20 B: well that'll be great 

582.58 591.11 A: yeah oh he adores animals and you know i i would have i don't i don't think in my early twenties i would have ever [sigh] uh 

591.14 597.14 A: looked for someone who quote unquote cared for animals or something like that [sigh] that just happened to be 

595.06 598.13 B: [sigh] i think that tells you a lot about somebody 

597.38 599.89 A: y- oh it does and it just happened to be
