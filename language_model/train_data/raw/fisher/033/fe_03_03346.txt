255.67 256.72 A: right 

256.83 260.66 A: so money isn't really important to you then either look

262.22 263.70 A: (( right i )) 

263.52 264.89 B: (( i don't know why i mean i )) 

263.82 265.98 A: (( know exactly maybe they're taking notes )) 

265.30 268.06 B: i wonder how they pick this topic it's uh 

266.80 275.75 A: i don't i don't know well i just said don't give me something i don't know anything about but life partners i think i would have a lot to say 

275.50 280.24 B: and well yeah but the things is the truth is you really don't know until you 

280.17 288.81 B: live with someone how they are you know what i'm saying although my nieces i have two nieces lived with two fellows for a long time but then they got married 

281.37 283.41 A: that's right that's very true 

288.49 289.49 A: (( ah )) 

288.63 297.81 B: when i was growing up you didn't live with anyone you know you got married and then you found out what he was about [laughter] you know and then uh it's that's 

290.81 292.37 A: no exactly 

293.95 296.48 A: exactly exactly 

296.79 305.56 A: i still do not believe in living together before you're married i but i my children have but i d- i personally do not believe in it 

300.39 301.47 B: yeah well 

304.08 314.18 B: yeah my daughter too and i i don't approve of it but you know it's a different world today it's it's a different world today and that's the way it is i don't approve of it either because [mn] 

306.79 307.75 A: no 

308.75 310.33 A: there's no question 

312.72 323.99 A: right but i don't think a man really shows his colors even though you know you know what his creature habits are but i don't think he's still on his best behavior 

320.66 322.07 B: right right right 

323.71 328.14 B: a- the a- absolutely th- absolutely that's where i feel that uh 

328.34 333.09 B: you really don't know y- you you have to find out yourself you can't tell 

329.56 330.53 A: yeah 

332.68 337.33 A: exactly well what do you feel about looks how important are looks 

333.17 334.46 B: women too are 

336.58 347.00 B: well [laughter] i w- i like looks i mean i uh everyone likes looks but if if someone is charming and nice you somehow forget about their looks after a while you know 

341.62 342.57 A: uh-huh 

345.21 346.52 A: yeah i think 

346.72 359.15 A: like you or like you said earlier as long as they're clean uh i mean i wouldn't have it an- i wouldn't even be interested for two minutes if i didn't think that they were clean and respectable i mean forget it 

350.02 351.65 B: clean right right 

359.07 360.34 B: right well 

359.57 366.48 A: but they don't have to be g- a gorgeous hunk either because once again i feel that puts too much pressure on me 

365.83 367.39 B: right right 

366.75 371.00 A: and you know i'm passable but i'm no beauty queen [laughter] 

369.56 379.61 B: oh i don't know who's i'm not ei- i'm not a beauty queen either but i and i see couples that you wonder how they get together so there has to be more than looks there has to you know uh it has to be 

372.32 373.08 A: it 

376.84 378.32 A: exactly 

378.38 384.70 A: exactly well how do you feel about a sense of humor everybody always says that 

382.45 383.60 B: oh that's 

383.51 398.09 B: that's very important because you have to have a sense of humor if you don't have a sense of humor y- y- you are just you're lost that that saves me sometimes you know you have to try to just forget about your troubles and and keep keep going keep going 

384.91 386.00 A: it is 

390.15 391.64 A: exactly 

395.60 396.74 A: right 

397.32 404.66 A: and if something doesn't work you you just laugh it off and say it isn't going to work let's you know let's move on 

403.35 404.13 B: well 

404.52 418.35 B: right well i i i haven't gone out with a man in a long time that way because uh i just don't i i go to work and i come home and that's it i mean as i said before if he fell from the sky that way that it that then there would be a possibility 

405.37 406.04 A: (( i )) 

412.41 414.04 A: right right 

417.91 426.98 A: oh really um i still look i j- i don't you know i don't go to bars or anything like that but if i'm ever in a place 

418.38 419.99 B: (( [laughter] i )) 

423.46 424.17 B: (( yes )) 

426.98 433.77 A: um church or wherever i would look around and if there was somebody of interest you know 

429.19 430.15 B: yeah 

432.74 442.18 B: well where i live there's a lot of senior citizen places and there a se- my mother belongs to every one but she wa- she's eighty years old [laughter] 

436.34 437.69 A: oh 

439.99 441.18 A: oh really 

441.83 443.85 A: oh my gosh 

442.78 457.65 B: so if i want to join you have to be sixty and up to join i'll be with my mother and i don't think that's a great idea no i [laughter] i don't think that's a great idea they i feel they don't have enough uh you know places for seniors to meet really 

446.78 450.92 A: oh i wouldn't want to do that no no i wouldn't like that at 

451.98 452.99 A: uh-huh 

456.92 460.57 A: right right ah that's interesting 

459.43 467.21 B: and i i'm not very uh i'm not going to ta- some people talk to anyone in the supermarket on the streets i'm not that way 

466.83 467.87 A: uh-huh 

467.54 472.47 B: so you know uh it it's hard to meet someone so i don't i just 

471.21 473.26 A: a- i think that's very true 

473.09 486.66 A: but i mean we both have kind of agreed as to what we're looking for we're saying looks aren't really important clea- cleanliness is important money isn't terribly important but we want somebody that's like 

479.96 481.42 B: right right 

482.85 484.42 B: no no 

486.43 489.03 A: healthy healthy and well 

486.48 492.90 B: somebody right somebody that's there for you someone you can talk to someone you can feel comfortable with you know 

492.46 495.21 A: yep yep and 

493.40 496.34 B: well you know so where is he where is he 

495.73 500.34 A: i know exactly and we want to have a good sense of humor 

499.42 501.23 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

500.88 509.63 A: but i always uh say to my daughter it was uh if i'm looking at anybody that she's dating i look at their teeth and their hands 

508.62 511.02 B: [laughter] i look- 

510.11 513.32 A: and if they have nice clean nails 

511.23 512.15 B: yeah 

512.24 515.61 B: [laughter] i always looked at hands too it's funny 

515.09 523.07 A: a- right and or i look to see because if they had grubby old awful hands it's like you know 

516.59 517.44 B: [laughter] 

523.70 530.71 A: that wouldn't appeal to me what at all and teeth if i thought i had to kiss somebody with a lousy mouth forget that 

525.49 526.42 B: yeah 

527.26 528.35 B: [laughter] 

529.70 539.93 B: i once [laughter] when i was younger i was dating this [laughter] fellow he had a space between his teeth and it annoyed me so much i was much younger i wonder how i would feel about it today i don't know 

537.33 538.16 A: (( uh-huh )) 

539.63 542.15 A: yeah that's right you have to see somebody 

541.11 545.91 B: [laughter] and then you're kissing someone and their teeth come out of their mouth you know [laughter] 

543.85 549.64 A: (( oh forget it oh forget it oh i'm fussier i'm fussier than that )) 

549.65 558.80 A: because what they didn't say to us would you rather be alone if you couldn't find your life partner and the answer is by all means a thousand percent yes 

555.59 556.45 B: yes 

556.76 557.55 B: (( yes )) 

558.16 561.68 B: yes i mean uh you know you find things to interest you 

561.45 562.81 A: exactly 

561.76 567.22 B: whether it's going to the theater whether it's eating out whether having a pet do you have a pet you 

565.60 566.58 A: yes 

566.60 568.16 A: i have a cat 

567.50 569.67 B: oh i have a dog and a parakeet 

569.44 582.48 A: oh do you but i don't care i mean i don't care anymore about i mean i love anima- i absolutely adore animals but i d- would not want to be tied down you know with animals any more 

570.23 571.27 B: yeah and i 

576.10 576.98 B: yeah 

580.14 581.13 B: well 

582.02 584.28 B: it it does tie you down that's true 

584.10 590.44 A: and uh that makes such a difference because it breaks my heart if i would have to board them or something like that 

589.19 590.12 B: right 

590.15 591.19 B: right 

590.59 594.45 A: so but i if a man had a dog that wouldn't turn me off 

594.63 597.75 A: i mean that you know that wouldn't bother me whatsoever 

598.65 599.89 A: but how do you feel about a
