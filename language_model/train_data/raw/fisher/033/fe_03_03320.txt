4.74 7.46 B: well i don't know quite where to start [laughter] 

4.91 10.62 A: [laughter] [laughter] i thought it was going to be easier than that [laughter] 

9.86 10.91 B: um 

12.01 14.25 B: what do we look for in a life partner 

13.23 14.68 A: a life partner 

14.56 16.01 B: compatibility 

16.11 17.36 A: yeah 

16.45 18.49 B: things that you like a- the same 

19.36 22.16 A: uh but i guess i would say honesty 

21.94 24.08 B: yes definitely 

22.90 24.44 A: um [laughter] 

25.26 27.38 B: yes lying doesn't go over big 

26.97 28.33 A: [laughter] no 

27.42 32.91 B: if they're going to lie to you about little things then you can expect big things to be lied to too usually 

31.27 32.29 A: yeah 

33.60 41.78 A: let's see what else [laughter] i'm married twenty six years i guess it's been a while since i've looked um [laughter] 

39.91 41.06 B: [laughter] 

41.53 42.11 B: (( [noise] )) 

43.56 44.72 A: (( honesty )) 

43.60 48.03 B: i was married twenty four the first time and uh ten years this time 

47.69 49.35 A: oh is that right 

49.11 49.96 B: (( [cough] )) 

49.80 55.37 A: well then you've you've had more recent practice so [laughter] um 

52.28 53.83 B: yes a little bit 

54.04 56.16 B: but i think honesty and 

56.21 59.16 B: you have to have some things in in common 

58.92 59.80 A: yeah 

59.20 63.26 B: not everything you'd be boring if you had everything in common but 

62.47 66.18 A: oh absolutely and somebody with a sense of humor 

63.70 65.43 B: some things in common 

65.87 66.86 B: yes 

66.20 67.76 A: for sure 

68.25 71.16 A: ah but like you say somebody definitely that 

71.31 81.57 A: is compatible somebody that [sigh] you're not fighting with over you know you have similar views in terms of money and household and th- you know that sort of thing you can have 

79.85 82.49 B: [noise] yes [noise] that definitely 

83.13 86.76 B: i know it makes it hard if you don't have have things in common [noise] 

86.70 100.99 A: yeah i'm the same my husband and i have very different backgrounds but in terms of the the big things i think um we think similarly like childrearing practices i would think it would be diff- very difficult if you have children and you both have a different vision 

100.97 103.95 A: on how you'd want your children raised or 

103.84 104.77 B: yes 

104.47 109.62 A: things like that how you wanted to spend your money or manage your money if you're savers or 

109.68 115.20 A: every penny goes out the door that you know those sorts of big i guess i see as big topics 

112.57 113.42 B: (( [noise] )) 

116.20 122.06 A: instead of you know whether you both like sports or you know things that you could certainly compromise on or 

119.59 120.40 B: [noise] 

122.10 128.45 B: yeah i agree there's there's a lot of things that you can compromise on if you're not a big sports fan and he is you can 

129.18 136.12 B: you can kind of compromise you know tell him hey we can do this sometimes but let's not do it all the time and 

130.89 131.77 A: yeah 

134.73 141.39 A: yeah those aren't life altering things that you'd ha- i wo- where i would say that you'd really need to see the same 

141.44 142.46 A: path 

144.49 146.25 A: let's see what else would i 

147.48 150.93 A: i have a daughter who's twenty i'm trying to think what i would 

151.12 152.90 A: tell her to look for 

155.52 159.80 B: to me looks and that is not that important you can think that they're 

158.20 159.00 A: no 

160.30 162.29 B: gorgeous and everybody else 

160.50 162.54 A: and you change so much 

162.66 168.37 B: you know [noise] may not but it's you know yours so i don't think looks are important at all 

169.46 170.84 B: a good heart 

170.53 174.00 A: yeah absolutely somebody who's good natured and 

174.89 177.98 A: willing to share and somebody who's loyal [mn] 

179.31 180.16 B: yes 

181.32 182.70 A: (( what else [noise] )) 

184.14 188.60 A: certainly they could have come up with an easier topic [laughter] 

185.69 193.52 B: [laughter] this is a hard one you know what you want but it's hard to put it into words because everybody's different 

190.13 190.99 A: yeah 

191.12 192.12 A: (( yeah i )) 

192.98 195.22 A: think more often you know what you don't want [mn] 

195.00 196.93 B: yeah that would have been easier 

195.95 196.70 A: (( uh-huh )) 

197.49 202.65 B: then i could have [laughter] really gone on 'cause i've been there done that and i know what i don't want this time 

197.94 204.17 A: i guess it's the [laughter] [laughter] oh okay [laughter] [sigh] 

202.70 203.83 B: (( [cough] )) 

204.39 207.02 A: okay maybe we need to just need to work backward 

207.97 210.10 A: what are we not looking for that you wanna 

212.13 213.36 A: (( mm )) 

213.57 217.18 B: i know i was looking for somebody the second time that was [noise] 

214.03 215.01 A: (( like )) 

217.27 219.02 B: had a big heart 

219.22 220.95 B: and didn't try to change me 

220.78 222.05 A: mhm 

221.75 226.02 B: that's what another thing you need to find somebody that'll accept you for you and not 

222.13 224.02 A: yeah somebody who's accept- 

225.96 227.71 A: absolutely 

227.06 231.64 B: try to make you something that you're not because then everybody's miserable 

233.77 237.08 A: and somebody who's who you can count on who's there for you 

236.71 238.06 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

237.72 239.36 A: is not selfish 

239.16 243.49 B: i think they have to become your best frien- they have to be your best friend before you marry 'em 

243.27 244.27 A: mhm 

244.72 246.07 A: yeah somebody 

246.98 248.41 A: i think so many people 

248.68 258.59 A: don't look you know down the line like you said about looks well that changes i mean i don't think i look a whole lot like i did when we first married and my hus- you know after 

249.24 250.17 B: [noise] 

253.48 254.42 B: yes 

258.81 262.99 A: many years you don't look the same and if that's what you know was the one big attraction 

263.43 266.52 A: well that doesn't stay with you for life you 

266.63 269.58 A: want somebody who's there for the long the long haul 

269.22 272.22 B: yes 'cause your looks change your weight changes 

272.56 276.54 B: unless you're really lucky it it changes [laughter] 

273.19 278.24 A: goodness knows [laughter] [laughter] [sigh] 

279.11 282.22 B: but i think the biggest thing is somebody that loves you for you 

283.13 283.76 B: (( just )) 

283.93 286.23 B: has a big heart and just 

286.24 289.32 B: similar similar views in things 

288.90 290.16 A: yeah somebody 

289.43 291.45 B: and is willing to compromise 

291.41 294.42 A: mhm yeah somebody with some flexibility 

296.38 297.77 A: and particularly when you 

298.65 302.99 A: have watched friends who have divorced and then remarried and it's interesting to see 

303.35 308.68 A: you know some of the things aren't quite as important the second time around if you're not going to have a family the sec- you know 

308.98 310.31 A: second time 

311.77 315.32 B: yeah you kind of look for different things and but then you never know 

311.79 312.93 A: some of the 

313.59 315.44 A: mhm 

315.48 317.92 B: you know whether you're going to end up with a family 

317.93 318.66 A: (( mm )) 

318.71 322.34 B: i didn't think i was but we're raising three grandkids so 

318.78 319.54 A: [laughter] 

320.30 321.78 A: is that right 

322.31 324.63 A: [mn] really 

322.54 325.29 B: ended up with a family and 

325.50 326.59 B: but it's [noise] 

325.70 327.54 A: (( well that's an interesting point )) 

328.65 336.64 B: so i think even though i- if it's your second third whatever time you need to take into consideration all the facts 'cause you never know 

338.03 345.13 A: i might have to mention that to two [laughter] to two that are [laughter] on the verge of marrying again yeah they keep saying 

341.51 345.39 B: yeah don't ever say you're never going to have kids 'cause any more kids [noise] 

345.26 350.54 A: yeah they keep saying that some of those things don't matter because you know we're not going there but you're right 

350.59 352.16 A: you don't know where you're going 

352.16 352.97 B: no 

352.53 355.40 A: or what's going to happen that's a great point 

356.46 357.89 A: hm [laughter] 

358.16 362.99 A: and that might might upset a couple of people [laughter] tonight when i talk to them 

360.43 361.99 B: [laughter] 

363.26 364.24 A: (( [sigh] )) 

364.56 366.14 A: okay [laughter] 

366.50 371.99 B: [mn] gee i don't know what else that you'd want in a life partner 

367.32 367.96 A: (( um )) 

370.47 371.39 A: yeah 

373.18 375.33 B: besides somebody that yo- you know 

376.40 381.36 B: somebody that you is your best friend that you can tell anything without them judging you 

381.24 384.97 A: mhm yeah it ah well that's a good one too though non judgmental 

386.64 388.56 A: guess that goes along with some of the other 

386.66 392.17 B: 'cause you know we all have our little quirks in life we do things that some people 

393.45 395.14 B: think are funny or 

395.32 398.26 B: that and you want 'em to not judge you for your little 

398.37 399.21 B: [laughter] 

398.85 399.95 A: mhm 

399.36 400.79 B: silliness 

402.59 403.17 B: (( [noise] )) 

403.45 407.53 A: well pets was much easier yesterday i'll [laughter] i'll say that 

403.60 404.51 B: (( [sigh] [noise] )) 

408.95 410.24 A: (( ah )) 

411.43 413.02 A: (( things you look for in a )) 

411.46 413.92 B: you don't realize ten minutes is a long time 

413.67 414.78 A: no it is well it 

418.25 419.55 B: (( [noise] oh )) 

422.52 423.37 A: (( hm )) 

424.85 428.47 A: well i wonder if a lot of people are finding this really easy [laughter] 

430.70 437.68 B: [noise] i don't know it's not quite as easy 'cause you know what you want but it's hard to put it into words and [noise] just tell somebody what you want 

435.71 437.60 A: and like you say sometimes 

437.63 445.16 A: you don't really recognize 'cause i guess i would say in some respects you'd want similar educational levels but you don't have to have that i mean 

445.82 448.22 A: i don't think it makes it easier 

448.42 450.59 B: [noise] it'd make it easier but 

451.52 455.47 B: [noise] if there's the love there and the compassion and the caring 

453.82 455.29 A: mhm 

455.78 458.46 B: lots of times you can overlook things like that 

457.79 463.28 A: yeah i was going to say if you have a lot lot of other things in common and similar world views or 

463.34 464.64 A: life views 

465.28 467.39 A: (( i'm sure you can bypass that )) 

467.96 474.48 B: it could b- be kind of a helping experience if if you didn't you could kind of help each other with what 

474.54 475.49 B: you know 

476.05 477.19 B: and kind of 

476.08 477.53 A: mhm 

477.22 479.49 B: encourage 'em to grow more 

479.13 481.64 A: yeah i was going to say and that can change too over 

482.04 484.92 A: over the years of marriage your educational level so 

486.26 488.03 A: not necessarily 

494.06 495.37 A: (( um )) 

500.85 503.34 A: what else i don't really think you need 

503.78 506.30 A: to come from the same part of the country or 

507.95 511.32 A: my husband's from a rural town and i'm from a big city so i don't 

511.36 513.90 A: i think you get over those things and find a 

514.69 516.75 A: place for yourselves just 

514.91 515.71 B: (( [noise] )) 

515.79 518.73 B: yeah you find a happy medium between things 

523.73 531.65 B: and in that aspect if you're from do- two different places like that then you can show the other one what that k- type of living is like 

530.44 532.66 A: yeah absolutely 

532.32 535.90 B: so that they can it broadens their horizons or [noise] whatever 

538.40 545.51 B: i know my husband's a truck driver so that's been a little bit [noise] different learning to be 

545.80 548.48 B: a single mother part of the time and a 

547.01 548.59 A: mhm 

548.55 550.84 B: wife and mother part of the time 

553.02 563.88 A: yeah and that might have been something that you would say well i don't think i could ever live like that but you fall in love with the right person 'cause i would think that's a hard life to you know have to be on your own so much of the time 

563.87 576.38 B: [noise] and i don't think i i don't know how i would have handled it if i had have been younger and starting a family and having to do it but i'm older and we'd planned on doing you know going places on his truck together 

564.59 565.15 A: (( [cough] )) 

576.57 581.20 B: didn't have quite planned to become a new mother again but 

578.99 579.97 A: [laughter] 

582.34 590.45 B: i have custody of three gran- well they're step grandkids and [noise] so it was kind of become a new mom 

589.08 590.37 A: (( [mn] )) 

592.89 596.23 B: in ah every aspect except for giving birth to 'em 

595.65 596.67 A: [laughter] 

596.91 599.89 A: thank goodness huh [laughter] at least you got to skip that part 

597.08 599.31 B: (( [noise] yes ))
