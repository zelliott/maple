222.88 228.22 B: (( [laughter] )) 

228.72 232.94 B: would have you would have you not married him if he'd have said a republican 

232.68 233.76 A: i would not 

233.69 235.42 B: you really wouldn't have 

234.81 236.85 A: no because uh 

237.45 244.21 A: i've found that and this is horrible to say but i've found that most very religious and he was 

244.70 247.59 A: not so much now he's gotten older and 

247.12 247.99 B: uh-huh 

247.68 250.95 A: uh but very religious uh 

251.45 257.14 A: uh republicans would not be what i want i'm a social worker and 

256.32 260.43 B: uh-huh i've worked in the mental health field that's what i've i've done for many years 

259.67 262.34 A: okay so so you know what i'm talking about it's 

261.61 263.79 B: a little bit yes i do yes 

262.82 266.39 A: okay you would have a different mindset 

266.66 269.14 A: towards people 

269.28 270.15 B: uh-huh 

269.43 278.39 A: if you were religious and a republican you might be a right but although that isn't true always but i felt that way 

276.54 279.59 B: r- right because i am a republican 

279.42 281.35 A: yeah but you see what i mean 

279.71 285.39 B: and [laughter] and i believe in god i'm not you know i'm not a bible thumper you know that kinda thing 

284.05 287.87 A: yeah but you aren't a uh fundamentalist 

287.39 289.60 B: no not no not at all 

289.21 293.50 A: yeah because if you were it'd be hard to be a social worker or mental health worker 

291.83 300.46 B: right i was i was raised you know i was raised up in a very traditional religious background you know just uh lutheran you know [laughter] 

299.35 301.44 A: mm i was raised catholic 

300.91 307.58 B: yeah well see i was i i i was the child of a mixed marriage my mother was catholic and my father was lutheran 

302.65 304.02 A: that's a difference 

307.49 309.53 A: oh that works out well though 

308.75 311.96 B: well yeah it it really it really did 

310.49 314.48 A: same beliefs it is that same belief with just different things 

312.66 313.57 B: my 

313.86 321.07 B: yeah my grandparents on my mom's side kinda frowned on it [laughter] but but they 

319.52 324.51 A: to me lutherans and it's just the same as the catholics unless they're the 

324.61 326.97 A: (( same thing only thing is it's a different church )) 

325.39 331.64 B: exactly exactly i mean you know if we wanna drink a beer we'll drink a beer you know [laughter] 

329.58 330.82 A: oh yeah i 

330.89 336.58 A: but it's the same thing you're gonna have masses you know here or i could go into most of the lutheran not all of 'em 

336.16 337.19 B: yeah 

336.58 346.33 A: uh i could go into a lutheran church they they it's more catholic than the catholic the episcopal church which is here in which is not higher episcopal it's kinda close 

345.89 346.77 B: uh-huh 

346.71 351.22 A: they're more catholic than the catholic church ever thought it'd be [laughter] i mean it is yes 

349.20 361.28 B: right well see that's the way that's the way the lutheran church is anymore and the lutheran form has always been that way well you know there's not they didn't they the churches aren't split anymore it's all evangelical lutheran 

361.39 367.36 B: and i mean you know even in the apostles' creed you know we still say we believe in the holy catholic church 

366.88 370.29 A: yeah that's because a catholic is a universal 

369.95 372.83 B: it's a universal word exactly but 

371.58 375.10 A: and we you know it it means catholic means universal 

374.67 378.51 B: right for many years we said the holy christian church 

378.09 379.62 A: (( well you know and )) 

378.87 382.49 B: so it's it's it's coming around that you know and

400.24 401.53 B: yeah 

402.45 403.18 B: (( you ))
