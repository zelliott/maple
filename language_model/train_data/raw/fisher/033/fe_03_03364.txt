51.38 52.07 B: (( oh [noise] )) 

52.52 55.34 A: so um i fully agree 

53.71 59.30 B: is it so you think friendship anything else what about what in friendship do you think 

55.51 56.46 A: excuse me 

56.47 57.71 A: [sigh] um 

58.72 67.09 A: i think that there is a huge amount of trust and honesty and they just under- they understand you and you like each other for the right reasons 

63.86 64.66 B: yeah 

66.78 68.03 B: yeah 

67.63 69.68 A: which i think is really good [laughter] 

69.17 82.26 B: and see for me as a [mn] the way i would look at [mn] you know of course trust and [sigh] and and honesty's important i would and i'd just like in for friendship wise i mean somebody that i can't trust and be honest with isn't going to be my friend probably [sigh] but for me it's 

80.82 82.21 A: no definitely 

82.05 97.01 B: it kinda goes beyond that and for relationships and friendship it [sigh] if i'm be friends with someone we're going to have common interests i don't i'm a tennis coach so of course i you know finding [sigh] a life partner that plays tennis would be great not likely maybe but it would be great for me [noise] [mn] 

93.03 95.03 A: [noise] [noise] nice [laughter] [lipsmack] 

98.57 100.86 A: yeah well and also 

101.28 108.93 A: once you get past i don't know how much you i've taken a bunch of classes in college i took a bunch on relationships [sigh] and um 

107.16 108.32 B: oh really [laughter] 

108.81 117.74 A: well just i was a psych major and so i took a bunch of classes where we talked about it and once you get past this thing called limirins which is like the first year and a half to two years 

110.87 111.70 B: okay 

117.85 119.13 B: (( okay huh )) 

118.25 121.80 A: [lipsmack] which is like the passionate love [sigh] you 

121.64 136.61 A: become [mn] you move on to compa- that's when most relationships end and past that you get to companionate love [sigh] which is more like i mean you're basically friends at that point but like or still attracted to each other hopefully and 

136.84 139.00 A: it's more long lasting 

139.14 139.93 B: wow 

139.19 141.74 A: [noise] so i feel like it's easier with friends i mean 

141.94 144.17 A: you can [noise] get to that point if you like it's 

144.71 151.34 B: yeah huh that's the short term i i'm going to remember that for probably the rest of my life that so i got a so like that one to two year 

145.24 148.16 A: it's just easier to get to that point probably because your friends 

148.44 150.27 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

151.42 153.89 B: mark is uh is the key huh 

153.40 165.51 A: is it's eighteen months plus or minus six months and there are different variables that go into it such as like whether you're long distance or [sigh] how early on you have sex and things like that 

156.96 158.09 B: (( [noise] [noise] sure )) 

165.31 166.20 B: wow 

165.75 170.14 A: [lipsmack] it all changes the time but eighteen months is pretty typical 

169.78 173.02 B: so so is it longer for like long distance relationships 

172.41 175.31 A: yeah it tends to be longer for long distance relationships 

173.89 175.13 B: (( well that makes sense )) 

175.60 178.93 B: huh so where where did you graduate college from 

176.42 177.32 A: yeah 

178.36 180.01 A: um i went to cornell 

180.35 184.29 B: oh wow but i have a friend that goes to cornell right now but he's 

183.14 186.08 A: yeah i graduated in two thousand one [lipsmack]

208.23 212.42 B: big difference that's why i get to hear you know sometimes there's relationships between [sigh] 

209.12 209.71 A: (( mm )) 

212.49 215.89 B: the tea- you know team team mates and things and it's [sigh]

226.80 232.47 B: got engaged and six months later they're done [laughter] so [laughter] 

231.67 243.81 A: see so they're in the whole thing [sigh] it's kinda weird most of my relationships end at that point which is what is supposed to happen [laughter] which is kinda scary once you may get past that point you're doing pretty good
