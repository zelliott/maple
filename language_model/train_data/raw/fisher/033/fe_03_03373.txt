99.43 110.12 B: [mn] sometimes you can't but marriage is a two is a partnership and if two people aren't willing to work at it together then the one can't do it for you know you wanna do it for him but you can't 

109.91 111.11 A: right and 

110.13 111.95 B: you can only do it for yourself

175.89 180.71 A: and he also believes in um [lipsmack] oh i can't even think of the word 

180.82 183.61 A: well he loves me unconditionally 

183.07 184.64 B: right right

204.83 213.10 B: i was in the military and you know i i had two kids but i you know was but then i got out of the military and then i started to go to school 

212.99 221.17 B: and i worked part time and that was like oh i'm i'm not doing enough you know and i was still bringing in an income though 'cause i was getting my g. i. bill 

221.32 232.83 B: and then i was um getting paid from my part time job but you know he was just the type of person who i always had to have a lot more so that he could waste and blow you know the money on stuff he wanted 

221.71 222.64 A: right 

231.04 232.31 A: (( on things )) 

233.20 236.64 A: my husband was in the military [laughter]

252.55 255.45 A: and no matter what weight i'm at 

254.90 260.44 B: uh-huh no matter what just unconditionally mhm 

255.71 259.22 A: no matter how terrible the kids are 

259.68 264.61 A: you know 'cause i mean i've got two children that are a. d. h. d. so wives get stuff all 

263.17 264.26 B: mhm 

264.36 265.53 B: yep 

264.91 270.92 A: but that's not my fault i still have to deal with it and it's not fair that i should have to deal with it by myself 

267.08 268.15 B: that's true 

270.34 273.35 B: right it's a partnership in every way 

273.11 276.65 A: exactly and the man i married had no previous children 

273.86 275.01 B: mhm 

276.23 277.58 B: mhm 

276.81 281.59 A: and here he is willing to help me parent these three boys a hundred percent 

280.50 284.88 B: oh that is so great so uh do you think you'll have any kids with him 

285.29 286.89 A: liked to but can't 

286.80 287.95 B: yeah 

286.90 298.64 A: he has a a problem that we didn't realize until after we had already been married which it's a good thing he says that god blessed him with the man i mean with the woman [laughter] with three kids you know there was a reason 

291.28 292.45 B: (( mhm oh )) 

295.78 303.59 B: right right well that's great and that's a great way to look at it you know and [lipsmack] hey that's really good

303.83 306.85 B: mhm mhm mhm 

308.97 314.56 A: well i guess i think the number one for me is faithfulness [laughter] and unconditional love 

312.83 313.80 B: mhm 

314.13 318.63 B: [lipsmack] right no matter what yep so 

314.97 316.32 A: those are probably my 

317.75 321.11 A: 'cause i mean once you've got those you can almost work through anything 

320.53 327.79 B: oh yeah that's right you know knowing that no matter what happens you know a person's still gonna love you and be in your corner so 

327.60 329.44 A: (( exactly [mn] )) 

328.38 334.23 B: mhm and that's how you know me and my husband feel about each other no matter what happens you know we're in this thing together 

332.35 335.58 A: you can work out anything with that 

334.08 343.77 B: mhm yep yep if if it's the two of you against the world in anything or anybody then hey you you got over half the battle whipped right there 

344.38 349.27 A: ex- i mean it's so nice to have someone that automatically comes to my defense 

348.86 350.84 B: (( mhm right )) 

350.30 354.18 A: whether i'm wrong or right you know with other people and 

351.46 353.24 B: right right 

353.27 359.53 B: right they're gonna be on your side and and that's a good feeling mhm mhm right 

355.02 359.09 A: they're not gonna be bad mouthing me to other people you know and 

359.83 365.33 A: i'm like oh my gosh [laughter] 'cause it's almost like i had to be unbrainwashed 

361.20 363.24 B: mhm yeah 

364.79 371.12 B: oh i know you do when you're in an awful marriage you know it takes a long time to really you know 

368.35 369.49 A: (( well [mn] )) 

371.11 376.18 B: um get over that stuff and to because it took me a long time to decide to um 

376.06 384.67 B: go ahead and and want to marry again because i had been you know through so much with that and it was like fifteen years later i stayed single for 

384.54 399.27 B: yeah a long time but you know i i would date and have relationships and they never panned out and it was like you know i was going through the same well you know see i told you he was gonna do this or he was gonna do that but it just wasn't the right person so until you meet that right one you know [lipsmack] 

385.63 386.87 A: oh my goodness 

390.23 390.95 A: (( [cough] )) 

398.79 404.46 A: i i lucked out i was so lucky i mean 'cause i was married for eleven years 

400.11 401.53 B: mhm 

403.88 405.57 B: mhm 

404.92 410.82 A: um had just joined a bowling league a couple of weeks before he had walked out on me 

410.22 411.80 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

411.14 418.21 A: and i joined a league with people that i didn't know but just because i needed time for me and they offered child care 

413.92 415.16 B: mhm 

416.38 417.68 B: mhm 

417.81 424.00 B: mhm that was a good thing too so that you could get outta the house and you know go someplace 

418.72 420.14 A: and i 

423.47 431.11 A: it it really was and so when i told the people that i bowled with one of i bowled with a a guy and an older woman 

424.56 426.30 B: mhm 

427.54 428.98 B: mhm 

430.60 432.19 B: mhm

438.78 440.12 B: mhm 

440.75 443.24 B: ah that was good 

442.40 452.12 A: but i bawled for i still cried over my ex for three years i think that's what proved my love for my husband now is he was willing to put up with me still trying to 

447.83 448.87 B: yeah 

453.16 455.48 A: deal with the emotional baggage 

454.96 458.60 B: yeah well yeah that that is really love 

456.53 458.41 A: 'cause i didn't get over it 

458.86 467.27 B: but they say you know before you try and and uh get into a marriage you should wait at least you know three to four years but at least he was there you know to help you through it and everything so 

466.54 475.54 A: i don't think i could've done it by myself with the boys i mean 'cause they're my boys now are sixteen fourteen and twelve 

468.82 470.86 B: (( mm mhm )) 

472.67 473.91 B: mhm 

475.14 476.13 B: oh okay

495.70 497.12 B: mhm 

497.87 500.01 B: mhm yeah 

499.40 504.88 A: but he just provided that that support that i needed and the friendship 

502.27 505.98 B: mhm mhm mhm 

505.35 509.90 A: and the fact that you know my ex husband was sitting there telling me nobody could ever love me
