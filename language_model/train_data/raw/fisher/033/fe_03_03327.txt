0.91 2.54 A: hi my name is lishea 

2.93 4.99 B: hi my name is dawn 

5.93 9.01 A: so what do you think is the most important thing in a life partner 

10.01 14.95 B: um i believe for me my my opinion um 

15.52 18.16 B: is that they share at least 

18.30 19.24 B: um 

19.50 34.00 B: something that you like even if you can just uh during the relationship enhance on it but at least one thing you know one thing that you can at least always go back to and say remember when [laughter] [noise] 

21.76 22.76 A: mhm 

25.71 26.70 A: mhm 

28.19 29.35 A: right 

32.07 43.47 A: [laughter] yeah yeah i think that would be important um i think probably the most important thing to me would probably be honesty and loyalty um 

43.03 43.93 B: (( mm )) 

43.94 55.11 A: being able to you know answer someone else's questions like if y- if you ever come across the problem like where have you been you know being able to actually say well you know i've been at work or 

55.10 57.09 B: right right 

55.24 57.75 A: you know being loyal to your partner 

57.35 61.55 B: the l- i think when you say honesty you just want uh 

61.98 65.56 B: you wanna make sure that you can you can be able to trust 

65.33 66.44 A: right 

65.87 69.72 B: right so yeah that that is very important i mean 

66.98 67.90 A: right 

69.72 72.60 B: there's you know there's really i don't think there's really one 

72.49 84.78 B: thing there's like a lot of things but i guess i guess i guess to- and i guess th- the topic i don't know if it's most important or what do you choose i guess it's a variety of things it doesn't have to be one thing 

75.83 77.59 A: right right 

83.55 84.66 A: right 

84.94 88.25 B: but is that like the most important to you i guess 

88.09 93.15 A: yeah i think that honesty and loyalty and trust are the most important things to me 

92.77 97.21 B: right what about uh do you look for i know i like someone who 

97.49 104.46 B: understands or likes humor you know [laughter] [laughter] 'cause i know um 

99.13 102.17 A: yeah yeah yeah definitely 

102.28 103.58 A: definitely 

105.26 107.06 B: [lipsmack] i i can 

107.14 110.65 B: be funny but i'm always serious 

110.38 112.22 A: yeah [laughter] 

110.86 120.15 B: so if if my partner can bring out humor in a situation when you know things aren't going too well [laughter] 

115.26 117.15 A: (( yes [laughter] )) 

118.66 121.01 A: yeah make you feel a little bit better 

120.52 123.32 B: that definitely helps 

123.13 124.87 A: yeah i think that's tr- 

123.46 124.45 B: um 

125.05 135.76 B: as for a partner the one that i have now i pretty much um i know a lot of people choose love they say oh you know my first i've been married twice and my first um marriage 

136.07 139.93 B: [lipsmack] was really it was love but i think it was just uh 

138.34 139.49 A: mhm 

140.20 144.07 B: like first love and you really don't 

141.56 142.68 A: mhm 

144.32 157.25 B: um you're i guess you're naive to a lot of things because you think that love will conquer all and i'm not saying that you shouldn't marry because you love someone but [sigh] i don't know i think [sigh] in my 

149.72 150.81 A: oh yeah 

157.35 165.31 B: my first time marriage i just i thought that love was gonna you know conquer financial situations that love was [laughter] gonna [laughter] 

163.02 168.39 A: right right you think that's always going to come into play yeah 

165.14 175.46 B: love was gonna do it all you know and that just didn't that didn't fizzle too well i mean we only lasted seven years trying to be in love and now 

170.08 171.38 A: yeah 

172.60 173.66 A: yeah 

174.21 177.38 A: (( that's a long time for just love [laughter] )) 

176.15 182.22 B: ah [laughter] god [laughter] but right now i'm with a person that 

177.41 178.98 A: [laughter] 

182.26 183.34 B: um 

183.35 187.47 B: and i think just too is very important is commitment 

187.14 189.37 A: [noise] yeah commitment definitely 

188.40 191.93 B: commitment because we finally we made a commitment 

192.04 196.68 B: even though i didn't feel like i was in love like wow or you know 

195.26 196.61 A: right 

196.80 204.45 B: but we made a commitment that we will we were going to work things out when things got tough you know we were going to say no no no you know 

204.57 211.70 B: we're gonna make it through and i think commitment is a very big issue i mean i think people nowadays 

207.35 208.55 A: right 

211.65 224.01 B: they get married blindly and they don't they don't stick to their commitment to their vows you know for better or for worse you know it's not going to be it's not going to be happy every day [laughter] 

213.63 214.78 A: mhm 

218.39 220.96 A: yeah it's too easy these days 

221.88 225.44 A: yep yeah there are some days that are so tough 

225.07 233.00 B: right so i think com- if you know once you choose your life partner or if you know the qualities like you say honesty and loyalty 

226.19 227.39 A: yeah 

232.40 232.96 A: (( [noise] )) 

233.01 234.07 A: mhm 

233.32 235.81 B: um you know commitment 

236.02 238.09 B: on top of that as well 

238.09 238.95 A: (( yes )) 

239.51 246.09 A: definitely but i think if you're honest and you're loyal and and you're in a relationship then you would be committed you know anyway 

245.75 247.08 B: that's true 

246.84 250.06 A: i suppose i mean w- as far as what i'm trying to say 

249.88 254.10 B: right right i mean it all kind of envelopes each other 

250.38 251.44 A: you know 

252.94 254.85 A: all goes yeah 

254.28 260.35 B: right oh well so how do you have you been married for a long time or are you or ab- about to get married or 

255.10 255.80 A: (( yeah )) 

259.75 264.75 A: yeah we're about to get married uh we've been together for three years and we have a little boy 

264.76 265.60 B: oh 

264.97 276.94 A: so um but i think he is very committed i think a lot of times people will always say he seems more committed than i do [laughter] and so i think it's funny sometimes to hear people say that but 

272.05 274.26 B: [laughter] 

275.81 283.09 B: so you you've chosen you think in your life you know in your partner you've chosen those qualities already 

282.27 292.64 A: yes yes yeah i think that we've even had this discussion before about what's most important you know when you're picking your partner and think those are both like top of the list for both of us 

283.32 284.65 B: well that's good 

292.21 297.87 B: right and then you can always like look back and say remember what we spoke on and we said we were going to 

296.41 299.65 A: yeah [laughter] yeah 

298.43 304.79 B: because i think in you know from experience i'm speaking um you know you get into a 

305.21 310.67 B: um [lipsmack] what's it called um yeah a comfort zone that you already have someone 

308.65 309.76 A: yeah 

310.18 311.47 A: mhm 

311.07 318.36 B: and you kind of like it's not so much that you you know because of course if you know that person they know you and they love you because of you but 

318.38 328.41 B: you get kinda like a you were there like wait a minute you weren't like this when we met each other [laughter] you get you know you get too comfort [laughter] zone i think is what 

322.88 324.99 A: yeah yeah yeah i underst- 

326.40 328.90 A: yeah you just get used to each other 

328.45 343.02 B: yeah and then they get they're and they're like wait a minute you know you're you've changed [laughter] no i haven't changed i've been the same person [laughter] but you do change also as you're with your your partner you do change 

331.40 332.59 A: yeah 

333.18 334.96 A: [laughter] 

336.60 337.86 A: yeah 

342.68 343.81 A: mhm 

343.18 347.51 B: and you know like you were saying you look for honesty and loyalty 

347.63 354.39 B: and that definitely plays a part where you know you can communicate and say look you know 

354.23 355.47 A: right 

354.93 359.93 B: i'm having a bad week or you know this and this happened because sometimes uh 

360.55 363.12 B: when the person is not 

363.63 364.60 B: you know 

365.21 368.14 B: i don't know kind of like not talking or not 

367.27 368.38 A: yeah 

368.39 372.14 B: you kind of like think well is it me did i you know did i not 

372.23 373.84 B: do this right or 

373.34 374.58 A: mhm 

373.96 382.42 B: so you know you go back again to what you were saying honesty and loyalty you know you know it's not you it's me there's something going on with me i don't know 

378.26 379.41 A: right 

382.62 385.71 B: you know and and that definitely [lipsmack] 

384.43 386.69 A: communication is a big deal 

386.64 387.65 B: right 

386.87 391.98 A: i think communication falls probably right under the list for me like number two [laughter] 

390.25 391.27 B: wow 

391.11 403.22 B: wow so it's like we have to [sigh] we i guess just like in anything it's you know l- l- like partners it could be you know for life or it could be partners as a friend it could be partners 

402.23 403.39 A: mhm 

403.18 415.96 B: you know in a relationship probably at work but i i think they're talking about like someone that you're actually going to be with for the rest of your life [laughter] okay [laughter] yeah but i think and now that you're saying all that i'm like gosh you know that's so true it's like it almost 

408.33 411.12 A: (( right spend the rest of your life yeah )) 

414.70 415.48 A: [laughter] 

416.50 420.14 B: it almost relates to almost a friendship you know 

419.48 420.51 A: yeah 

420.26 424.97 B: but it seems like i'm more honest with my friends [laughter] than i am with my [laughter] 

423.14 427.33 A: [laughter] yeah it seems like that [laughter] 

426.42 430.99 B: i i know that sometimes i can get that way just because it's easier 

430.75 431.86 A: yeah 

431.39 436.63 B: to talk to a friend as opposed to a l- a partner where you feel like oh no 

435.00 436.02 A: mhm 

436.67 438.41 B: you know if he knows then 

438.54 445.49 B: you know y- you get scared i guess you get scared you know [laughter] so i mean 

439.32 440.63 A: oh yeah 

440.95 441.96 A: oh yeah 

443.10 444.67 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

445.38 454.25 B: the the most important thing too of course you have to love each other definitely because you know you overcome certain things but not the kind of love when i was 

449.79 450.91 A: oh yeah 

454.46 461.36 B: back in the day where i was like oh you know and [laughter] i just didn't see any i didn't see an- you know love is blind [laughter] 

457.11 458.55 A: [laughter] 

460.41 462.11 A: (( oh yeah )) 

461.49 464.95 B: i didn't see any faults and plus you know you think about it 

465.08 473.57 B: when you're um young and and well i'm not saying that you're not young but you're just you go through so many challenges 

469.96 471.20 A: right 

473.22 474.76 A: oh i know 

473.76 482.24 B: and d- you know depending on the type of model that you had when you were growing up i know a lot of people come from divorced families 

478.82 479.95 A: mhm 

482.16 483.14 A: yeah 

482.57 483.97 B: it's actually 

484.02 488.53 B: it's a challenge to stay together and stick to those vows so 

488.67 499.08 A: yeah the partner that i'm with right now he's um mexican and being mexican he's from mexico actually so their divorce is almost zero 

496.27 501.72 B: oh wow wow so you s- uh do you have a spanish or do you have a language barrier or 

501.20 512.36 A: well actually no he um moved here about three years ago and spoke all spanish and learned english he probably has a better vocabulary than i do now but he's only spoken it yeah so 

509.32 522.26 B: oh that's good really good wow so are you guys you guys definitely then mean you know what you were saying honesty and loyalty because i think it's a challenge 

512.71 513.70 A: (( yeah and )) 

513.82 515.72 A: we have a son together 

517.87 519.00 A: oh yeah 

519.25 520.49 A: yes 

522.31 532.46 B: um me being half spanish it's a challenge spanish men tend to [laughter] not be loyal and honest to their women [laughter] 

524.48 525.68 A: mhm 

528.19 529.43 A: oh yeah 

529.67 541.01 A: right right see the thing is though from being from mexico like culture and beliefs and values are so strong down there you barely ever hear of divorce so 

537.64 538.76 B: right 

539.91 541.77 B: right right 

540.94 549.03 A: i know that he his whole thing is you know no divorce if we're married then we're married and we're going to work it out no matter what [laughter] so 

547.30 553.33 B: well that's good at least you know you have that and that's a strong definitely that's a strong 

551.61 552.71 A: yeah 

553.61 556.90 B: you need something you need that foundation like you said 

556.60 557.74 A: right 

557.61 571.99 B: wow and that's interesting i know a lot of um [lipsmack] like i said you know a l- a lot of spanish people and you're right uh that to them but it's just i've ha- i guess i've had a problem with the men part of it 

564.00 565.07 A: mhm 

571.01 573.03 A: [laughter] 

572.27 586.47 B: not that i've ever been wi- with you know but it's just like you see how someti- and you know what i don't care if they're spanish or it's it it's the man itself the way you know society thinks they should be 

573.58 574.45 A: [laughter] 

582.02 583.75 A: yeah yeah 

586.17 587.68 A: (( yeah [noise] right )) 

587.13 594.79 B: but um for some reason men you know spanish men tend to be a little bit um more i guess you know they [lipsmack] 

595.18 598.22 B: what's the word they like they like 

598.60 599.95 B: attracting women
