8.89 10.17 B: hello 

9.89 11.28 A: i'm suzie 

11.00 12.66 B: hi i'm kelly 

12.44 14.25 A: pleased to meet you kelly 

14.57 17.51 A: okay so our topic is life partners 

17.60 19.78 B: i guess [laughter] 

18.53 20.39 A: [laughter] okay 

20.68 29.56 A: so what's the most important thing um that you had uh when you found your life partner or if you're still looking for your life partner 

31.22 36.32 B: um [lipsmack] mostly mine was mostly um stability 

36.98 43.19 B: that they were stable and 'cause my husband has been with the same company for 

43.31 46.79 B: twenty seven years and 

47.01 49.32 B: he's able to 

49.38 51.62 B: take care of us and and 

52.67 53.92 B: we get along 

54.70 56.85 B: normally real well [laughter] 

56.63 66.62 A: that sounds good well i think i was more choosy second time around because uh my first husband or my life partner as they call it 

66.79 69.94 A: um our marriage didn't work out 

70.30 76.19 A: and um in him i just saw this guy that i fell in love with 

76.32 83.09 A: and when i kind of woke up and smelt the roses i'd met an alcoholic 

83.45 86.87 A: um and my first husband died 

86.89 94.08 A: uh so the second time around when i was looking for a life partner i was kinda choosy [laughter] 

92.90 94.05 B: right 

94.37 99.40 A: and uh yes i was looking for someone obviously that was stable 

99.46 107.73 A: um prior to me marrying my second husband he'd been in the royal air force for twenty two years in her majesty's service 

107.75 117.17 A: um and then he um was uh a road safety officer um with the county where we were living in england 

117.10 125.15 A: um so that kind of made me feel good and um he was mature he was older than i was 

125.30 132.77 A: and i kind of thought that was a blessing [laughter] i don't know how how do you feel about having an older partner 

128.42 129.54 B: yes 

133.06 133.95 B: uh 

134.08 137.44 B: it's it's fine with me my husband's older than i am 

137.11 138.11 A: uh-huh 

137.75 140.67 B: and he's he's quite a bit older than i 'cause he's 

141.03 143.91 B: he's about thirteen years older than i am 

143.59 151.82 A: and my husband's fifteen years older than i am [laughter] um were you kind of looking for a father figure oh 

146.89 147.76 B: [laughter] 

152.54 155.58 B: um no not really um 

156.03 159.23 B: i already have two [laughter] so 

157.83 159.01 A: okay 

159.64 160.65 B: (( um )) 

161.50 163.24 B: no it was just 

164.57 170.02 B: we met and and hit it off and and then uh 

170.57 175.89 B: we had a a little boy and and i already had one son 

176.45 179.88 B: and then after that like i think it was 

181.18 183.19 B: almost two years after 

183.49 187.26 B: my youngest son was born when we got married 

186.64 187.70 A: uh-huh 

189.01 193.52 A: so so you realized that you'd you'd found your partner this this time 

193.35 194.38 B: right 

194.09 200.09 A: uh-huh well i i can say from experience that second time around is so much better for me 

200.48 201.62 A: um 

201.76 205.68 A: i i think i was a little bit more choosier this time 

205.76 210.16 A: um i looked for someone that would be a best friend um 

210.54 212.96 A: that we would um be 

213.14 225.41 A: compatible um although we are we are opposites um in many many ways um it's changed because we are best friends uh do you spend a lot of time with your husband 

221.76 223.02 B: mhm 

226.19 227.04 B: um 

227.81 233.85 B: here recently i've we've spent a lot more time together because i don't um

238.90 240.61 B: from inside my home 

240.29 241.38 A: uh-huh

245.24 246.80 A: uh well my 

248.22 249.23 A: (( no )) 

249.26 260.77 A: well when i lived in england i i worked very long hours as a sales office manager and my husband as i say worked for the county but when we moved to america we owned a restaurant so 

249.34 250.21 B: no 

260.67 268.29 A: uh we were both working in the restaurant uh seven days a week [cough] excuse me three hundred and sixty five days a year so

303.25 309.21 A: i i look for him to encourage me in my work which he does um 

309.26 316.78 A: he he basically encourages me in everything i do um and i think that's a great asset in a partner 

317.02 318.18 A: um 

318.39 321.89 A: do do you have any more assets that you can think of in your partner 

322.30 323.19 B: um 

325.74 326.60 B: well

333.26 336.01 B: oh yeah [laughter] he uh 

336.32 344.82 B: he washes dishes and picks up the house and takes care of of uh the two boys that we have 

344.17 345.54 A: (( uh-huh good )) 

345.22 348.55 B: and he's he's a workaholic 

348.27 349.30 A: uh-huh 

349.63 351.20 B: yeah he likes to 

351.75 352.70 B: (( um ))

354.69 355.91 B: working 

355.97 357.29 B: at something 

357.14 358.29 A: yes 

358.45 359.65 B: and then uh 

360.21 361.27 B: we uh 

361.87 363.13 B: spend uh 

363.73 364.80 B: take our 

365.24 369.48 B: kids to the races stock car races and 

370.05 370.81 B: (( [noise] )) 

371.83 373.21 A: that's good 

374.41 375.81 B: uh-huh [laughter] 

375.19 380.20 A: uh-huh um my my family's in england so it really is my husband and myself so 

380.33 390.90 A: he is my family and i mean he comes food shopping with me grocery shopping um we we basically do everything together 

391.04 392.20 A: and 

392.24 402.59 A: i live in florida so we love to go to the beaches uh we live close to bush gardens so we go to bush gardens every couple of weeks together 

402.95 404.31 A: and uh 

404.73 409.08 A: although some of my interests aren't his he he still comes with me 

408.76 409.95 B: mhm 

409.34 417.61 A: and i think that's very important um you know your partner will do something that they kind of are only half interested in [laughter] 

416.88 420.39 B: yeah [laughter] yeah 

420.37 427.47 A: but i i think that goes both ways because sometimes i'll watch um a cowboy movie which i 

427.37 435.91 A: don't like [laughter] or you know um perhaps watch some sport that he's watching with him on television which i don't particularly enjoy 

435.96 439.26 A: but i figure yeah so what we're together 

439.18 444.95 B: mhm [lipsmack] yeah i'm i'm that's that's the way that i am 'cause they like 

440.14 441.19 A: (( and )) 

445.51 446.72 B: they like to 

447.37 451.67 B: especially him he likes to fish and and i'm not a big fisherman but 

451.57 464.69 B: we'll w- sorta like on sundays we'll watch the fishing shows [laughter] and i i don't i don't care for 'em but you know that's what we that's what we do on on sundays together 

455.88 457.06 A: (( uh uh-huh )) 

464.32 466.51 A: yeah uh-huh 

465.77 466.79 B: so 

466.92 468.26 A: yeah so 

468.44 476.05 A: so basically uh getting back to the most important thing in our partners i think we've probably both found it 

475.85 476.81 B: yes 

476.51 478.77 A: you know that we're still with them 

478.76 479.85 B: mhm 

479.26 485.20 A: and uh with my second husband it's been twenty two it's going to be twenty three years this year 

485.29 487.07 A: um so 

487.12 492.72 A: i know it's been happy it's been stable um he's the love of my life 

493.02 494.37 A: um 

494.47 496.48 A: how many years have you been married 

497.01 498.39 B: um 

501.31 502.72 B: well let's see 

506.49 509.43 B: five we've been married for five years 

508.77 511.07 A: uh-huh but you've known each other longer 

510.98 513.96 B: yeah we've we've known each other for 

516.80 518.57 B: oh probably about ten uh 

518.37 520.49 A: yeah uh-huh 

520.73 522.05 A: and 

522.12 524.74 A: is everything going as good as you'd hoped 

525.59 527.30 B: for the most part yes 

527.07 530.14 A: that's good [laughter] 

528.08 529.40 B: [laughter] 

530.13 532.08 B: sometimes you wonder but 

532.54 534.55 B: then it all works out so 

534.36 535.65 A: uh-huh 

535.99 537.31 A: yeah 

537.49 541.96 B: i think everybody has their their trials and tribulations 

537.51 538.40 A: well 

541.60 545.02 A: that's right but if at the end of the 

545.08 555.50 A: end of the day that you can have a cuddle and um go to bed to- together and say goodnight and i love you i think that's the most important thing in a marriage 

555.25 557.09 B: yes yes yes [cough] 

556.65 558.09 A: i really do 

558.28 572.41 A: i always think you know whatever the day brings um even if you have a little disagreement if you can have that little hug at the end of the day and uh tell that person they're the most important person in your life um 

572.62 576.86 A: that kind of um tells you that that is your life partner 

576.87 579.08 B: right yes it does 

578.39 580.04 A: (( yeah )) 

580.28 581.57 B: yeah 

581.24 582.32 A: um 

583.28 588.02 A: what else on this subject [laughter] um 

584.89 585.91 B: [laughter] 

588.28 590.62 B: we get the get the hard ones 

590.16 599.89 A: it is uh ob- obviously with a life partner you um obviously wanted a husband you never ever thought um that you'd want
