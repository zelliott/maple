19.20 26.13 A: what's been the most important thing [sigh] for you i gu- [sigh] um in a life partner 

26.01 27.96 B: um well 

28.27 30.21 B: trustworthiness 

29.81 30.88 A: uh-huh 

30.61 31.97 B: um 

32.96 36.42 B: somebody who is participatory [mn] 

36.33 37.22 A: uh-huh 

36.87 38.39 B: um 

39.78 41.03 B: let's see 

42.82 45.31 B: somebody who i enjoy somebody who 

46.23 49.85 B: um i don't want to say fun because that's too 

52.01 53.37 B: generic 

53.25 54.42 A: yeah 

53.82 57.11 B: um but somebody who i can 

57.95 60.45 B: have positive times with 

60.30 61.66 A: yeah 

61.90 65.59 B: um somebody who shares similar values to me 

65.40 66.74 A: mhm 

67.27 68.73 B: [lipsmack] what about you [sigh] 

68.70 75.49 A: um well the first thing i thought of right off about was the similar values um 

76.36 77.45 A: um 

77.68 79.52 A: it helps 

79.65 84.32 A: i don't know i'm i'm married so i guess i can only say it from a point of view that i'm married [laughter] i 

84.47 85.59 A: i've already 

85.99 87.09 A: um 

88.84 91.19 A: (( [lipsmack] found uh we both )) 

91.43 99.27 A: sh- yeah i can't even talk today we both share the same religious views um the same political views and 

95.39 96.49 B: mhm 

99.30 100.41 A: um 

101.20 103.25 A: but 

103.37 110.01 A: i i think if we disagreed on either one of those that would make things pretty difficult [laughter] but um 

108.40 109.48 B: yeah 

109.92 117.22 B: well i'm civilly unioned from vermont [laughter] uh and same you know s- same 

112.89 113.94 A: uh-huh 

117.25 118.79 B: religious 

119.24 126.30 B: ah well same religion but you know it's that's kind of an interesting thing because we have different levels of practice 

126.30 127.22 A: uh-huh 

126.32 128.66 B: and that has created some 

129.11 132.60 B: not huge amounts of tension but but some disagreement 

132.29 133.42 A: yeah 

132.82 137.14 B: um and political views we're both 

137.76 142.07 B: [mn] we're pretty similar we we agree on most things 

141.20 142.30 A: yeah 

142.24 143.27 B: um 

143.91 145.50 B: and 

145.81 155.99 B: you know i think it's not so much that [mn] with somebody th- not so much having similar views of stuff as much as being open minded 

155.68 157.05 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

156.83 160.46 B: um we run into our greatest problems when 

161.23 165.68 B: [sigh] one person is being rigid [sigh] about something 

164.34 165.20 A: yeah 

166.18 169.69 B: so i think being flexible is important to me [laughter] 

168.99 175.12 A: yeah definitely compromise or flexibility in a relationship is a must [laughter] 

174.53 175.81 B: yeah 

175.39 176.37 A: um 

176.96 178.24 A: knowing to when 

178.46 181.32 A: knowing when to admit you're wrong [laughter] 

180.65 181.63 B: mhm 

181.36 186.17 A: ah that's one of my weaknesses admitting when i'm wrong [laughter] 

185.54 194.72 B: yeah that's one of mine too [laughter] it's hard to do i mean you know there's some stuff that it's easy to do it's it's the it's the hard ones that 

187.47 189.44 A: yeah [laughter] 

192.80 195.23 A: yeah yeah yeah [laughter] i- 

195.41 201.56 B: i have no problem admitting when i'm wrong when it's you know something that's not ah emotionally 

201.23 206.02 A: is there a chicken in the freezer [laughter] that type of thing [laughter] yeah um 

202.59 204.22 B: (( yeah )) 

206.68 208.74 B: how long have you been married 

208.13 211.08 A: [lipsmack] ah it'll be four years in october 

210.73 211.71 B: wow 

211.38 215.33 A: yeah and we have three children under the age of three [laughter] 

214.58 216.28 B: oh my god 

215.81 218.23 A: yeah um i think 

216.70 217.50 B: you 

217.97 219.83 B: a- any twinning in there 

219.63 228.27 A: ah no [laughter] no i ah my son will be three in june and my daughter is seventeen months and 

228.90 231.45 A: my youngest son is five months 

231.29 232.25 B: uh-huh 

231.76 234.77 A: he was born eight days before my daughter's first birthday 

234.22 235.18 B: uh-huh 

235.05 236.98 A: yeah but we're done now 

236.89 237.95 B: yes 

237.15 242.80 A: done done taken care of that all done [laughter] yeah 

240.10 246.76 B: yeah well we have one child who's five and uh you know that's 

243.13 244.26 A: yeah 

247.05 254.78 B: [sigh] you know he autistic so that's cr- we have very different styles when it comes to childrearing 

254.31 255.37 A: (( uh-huh i )) 

254.78 262.83 B: i mean we have some similar views but there are some things that we disagree on which creates some some problems 

262.08 270.47 A: think it depends on how you were raised too that you either don't want to do it the way your parents did or you want to do it the way your parents did or you know just 

269.25 270.28 B: right 

271.18 284.47 B: um so so getting back to the life partners having having a life partner who has similar views about whether or not to have children how many children and uh views about childrearing 

273.02 273.88 A: sorry 

274.01 275.10 A: yeah [laughter] 

284.08 286.58 A: yeah that's for sure 

286.26 288.09 B: is is important 

288.17 297.11 B: uh but we run into a lot of problems um because we have such different styles with david and he's a a dif- difficult child to 

296.44 297.72 A: yeah 

297.49 299.22 B: know what's going on 

299.49 300.91 B: and 

301.25 308.07 B: he like any other child i mean this doesn't autism is irrelevant here he really knows how to work his parents 

307.79 308.76 A: uh-huh 

308.11 310.73 B: so he knows how to bounce one off the other 

310.30 313.64 A: [laughter] it doesn't take 'em very long to figure that out does it 

310.83 311.65 B: it 

312.29 314.66 B: [laughter] no it doesn't 

314.02 316.17 A: [laughter] [sigh] 

315.75 322.24 B: you know i just i mean clearly you folks have enjoyed having children you've got three of had three of 'em boom boom boom 

321.78 323.06 A: yeah 

322.41 326.29 B: um you know it's i just find that 

327.23 331.61 B: i don't you know children put a big strain on the relationship 

330.38 332.87 A: yes yeah i that's 

332.97 336.93 A: i think most of our disagreements tend to be about 

336.97 343.67 A: either something to do with the children or something to do with money [laughter] you know that just or lack thereof [laughter] 

340.56 341.88 B: (( mhm )) 

343.02 349.42 B: yeah ours is time management more than the money it's like you know wh- wh- who's going to get 

344.90 346.11 A: yeah 

349.43 355.69 B: since we only have one it's like you know one of us could theoretically go out some evening while the other is at home 

355.36 356.48 A: mhm 

355.87 369.44 B: um and we also have a regular sitter that comes but it's this you know who's gonna you know take david to to school and [mn] who's going to do this that or the other thing and [mn] 

366.04 367.24 A: yeah yeah [laughter] 

368.85 370.79 A: yeah 

369.88 371.57 B: that that's where our 

372.30 374.05 B: [mn] our struggles come 

374.03 376.84 A: yeah i think 

377.48 379.77 A: humour is 

379.75 394.74 A: is something that's very important i mean to i mean i think a lot of times you know when you're in situations that are difficult sometimes all you need is a little bit of comic relief and luckily both my husband and i are 

395.32 398.33 A: um [lipsmack] we're we're both very good at 

399.22 403.94 A: at doing that i think someone just pointed that out to us [lipsmack] um 

403.97 406.69 A: last night we were with a group of friends and 

404.78 406.16 B: mhm 

406.83 409.67 A: my husband was recently laid off from his job 

409.41 410.46 B: oh boy 

410.10 417.28 A: and well he ou- our big [sigh] praise right now is that ah he 

417.82 424.17 A: just got a job on monday and he starts his new job this coming monday so we're very excited about that but 

421.97 423.02 B: mhm 

424.09 429.60 A: somebody was pointing out to us that even though he'd been laid off for a couple of months that 

429.52 439.39 A: we still managed to retain our humor about things and yeah i think [sigh] a- at least in our relationship that's a very important thing [laughter] 

431.80 433.01 B: mhm 

438.35 441.68 B: yeah yeah well you know my 

441.73 445.45 B: my wife just definitely can make me laugh 

445.03 446.15 A: yeah 

445.51 447.05 B: (( and ah )) 

447.48 450.84 B: i'm not as good in the other direction [laughter] 

450.17 451.88 A: [laughter] 

451.10 459.19 B: which kind of is frustrating because sometimes i try to be you know cute or humorous and then she just kind of looks at me there are other times that i succeed 

457.02 457.98 A: uh-huh 

459.20 462.63 B: but she's generally very good at making me laugh [lipsmack] 

459.40 460.23 A: uh-huh 

462.25 463.61 A: yeah 

463.45 469.02 B: and uh [sigh] yeah hu- humor is definitely important [mn] 

466.15 467.09 A: [laughter] 

468.21 470.00 A: yeah 

470.46 472.79 A: (( [sigh] ooh um )) 

472.83 473.96 A: let's see 

474.54 477.85 A: honesty and trustworthy those are both very important things 

477.23 479.99 B: yeah i can definitely trust her 

479.69 482.07 A: (( yeah so )) 

481.98 484.59 B: that's i mean that's just not even a question 

484.60 486.01 A: yeah 

487.11 488.91 B: so um 

488.99 493.07 A: and love that's a good thing too [laughter] 

490.48 491.67 B: (( mhm )) 

492.73 495.66 B: (( but love is a funny fleeting sort of thing )) 

495.69 496.24 B: (( a )) 

496.07 504.36 A: so um oh i think there's a difference between say like lust and love i think i think love is i mean like 

500.57 501.67 B: okay 

505.51 512.96 A: i i mean when you love your your partner or you love your your child i mean i can't imagine ever not 

514.51 515.51 A: loving 

515.67 525.47 A: my children at least [laughter] there are times when i'm not so fond of my husband but i mean i still love him you know it's definitely love is not a noun it's a verb it's something that you have to 

519.53 520.55 B: mhm 

526.03 527.61 A: do not 

527.77 528.79 A: you know 

528.70 533.82 B: well that's i mean that comment about you know there are times when you're not so fond of your husband i mean that's 

534.67 537.37 B: that's i i i guess 

537.45 543.81 B: the question of love and how does that fit in there i mean when when she pisses me off 

543.56 544.54 A: yeah 

543.90 547.84 B: it's like love is not the thing that i'm like actively 

547.96 549.61 B: feeling [laughter] 

548.75 549.82 A: right 

550.34 555.80 B: i mean we're we're both committed to making the relationship work and we work through these things but 

555.07 556.11 A: right 

555.86 557.03 B: yeah i 

557.86 560.07 B: i i guess you know our 

560.58 565.71 B: media images of love and stuff just i i don't relate to 

565.43 566.60 A: yeah 

566.16 568.52 B: i don't understand what it means 

569.43 574.86 B: 'cause there you know in a relationship there are better times and worse times and 

569.49 570.72 A: (( um yeah )) 

573.80 575.15 A: yeah 

574.88 576.40 B: you know you're 

576.41 581.22 B: at least for me my partner is not always you know the most glorious 

581.28 587.31 B: you know stars in th- seeing stars kind of person there and there are times that are very hard [laughter] 

586.40 588.23 A: yeah 

589.17 593.40 A: that's i mean that's the same way with 

594.05 599.36 A: my husband there are definitely times that uh [lipsmack] 

599.45 599.89 A: (( there are ))
