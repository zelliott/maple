7.07 8.68 B: hi good to meet you 

8.00 9.59 A: hi you too 

10.10 12.17 B: so we're supposed to talk about 

12.27 16.99 B: our most the traits we think are most important for a life partner 

16.99 24.75 A: yeah um i think that a big trait is just uh trust and respect 

17.91 18.86 B: okay 

24.48 25.55 B: uh-huh 

25.65 28.29 A: you really have to i don't know 

28.38 29.37 A: um 

30.31 36.89 A: without trust i don't think that uh you'd be able to really have a very good relationship with the other person 

37.37 43.80 B: yeah i agree with you i think that's really really important and i would i would say um 

41.18 41.97 A: yeah 

43.81 47.18 B: [lipsmack] that you need to hold the same 

47.51 50.89 B: values um as far as you know 

48.75 49.73 A: mhm 

51.56 60.84 B: whether or not you're gonna value a family life or career paths um that you just really need to share the same goals in life 

60.91 70.92 B: um together whatever you decide otherwise you know you're gonna be going in different directions and it's a lot more difficult i think to um 

60.94 61.78 A: (( yeah definitely )) 

71.19 72.07 B: you know 

72.23 76.72 B: stay with someone if you're going in different directions but 

74.88 75.91 A: mhm 

76.80 81.44 B: um are you married or you have c- children at all or 

79.63 89.21 A: no i'm actually um only a senior in high school [laughter] so i'm pretty young um but yeah i have a a 

83.37 84.91 B: oh you are [laughter] 

85.85 87.20 B: yeah 

89.21 98.24 A: my parents are still married and everything and i have a good relationship with them and so i think they're doing a pretty good job as far as the whole life partner thing goes 

91.42 92.57 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

97.62 98.69 B: right 

98.12 105.05 A: um they really i don't know they value each other and really respect each other and everything and so 

102.07 103.13 B: uh-huh 

104.17 108.73 B: uh-huh so you probably that's good that you have such a good um 

105.44 106.44 A: it's really 

108.85 111.99 B: you know example to look at and 

110.27 119.19 A: yeah it is it probably will help later on when i decide to get married or if i get married um how 'bout you 

117.06 118.19 B: yeah 

119.00 121.41 B: i'm married and i have two kids 

121.12 122.27 A: oh cool 

121.93 128.75 B: so um so yeah i've i've i've found you know just so far i've only been married 

122.50 123.12 A: (( uh-huh )) 

129.15 135.30 B: seven and a half years but um [lipsmack] you know it's been really important that my husband and i have 

131.27 132.21 A: oh cool 

135.83 145.65 B: we have similar goals and you know i mean we have different interests but when it comes down to it you know we know 

137.42 138.26 A: yeah 

145.73 151.94 B: our focus is on our family and so that kinda guides all the other stuff we 

152.51 155.48 B: end up doing and decide you know what's 

155.00 155.97 A: yeah 

155.54 157.45 B: what's most important 

157.56 158.41 A: yeah 

157.65 160.68 B: like um for for instance 

160.72 171.94 B: i'm a stay at home mom now i taught school for six years and um which i really enjoyed but then we kinda decided you know we started having kids that we wanted um 

172.34 173.88 B: we just really wanted 

174.21 176.82 B: [lipsmack] them to be raised by 

177.50 179.86 B: us you know and not um 

180.19 189.22 B: go like the day care route and that we just decided and so it's k- it's been a sacrifice you know money wise like we don't have a dual income 

187.89 188.69 A: yeah 

189.12 190.15 A: mhm 

189.51 190.86 B: but um 

190.97 192.01 B: (( [lipsmack] i )) 

192.25 196.87 B: i think it's really paying off you know that we have um 

197.62 202.92 B: an opportunity to just you know kind of mould them and um 

203.03 205.04 B: shape them and 

205.27 209.04 B: hopefully teach them some things anyway [laughter] 

207.92 222.36 A: yeah i know that when my uh when i was younger and my siblings were younger um my mom didn't work she was a stay at home mom too and um now that we have all grown up uh [laughter] she has a job and everything so it's 

215.18 217.01 B: uh-huh that's great 

219.38 220.29 B: yeah 

221.46 223.20 B: good yeah 

222.57 226.50 A: it's always a sacrifice there's always sacrifices to be um 

226.52 231.17 A: made but i mean and i think it all works out perfectly fine so 

230.61 233.07 B: yeah oh yeah 

231.35 232.07 A: um 

232.09 234.88 A: it's always it's always interesting the whole 

234.92 236.97 A: relationship thing [laughter] but 

236.39 237.66 B: right [laughter] 

236.99 240.54 A: yeah so um how 

238.15 238.80 B: (( [cough] )) 

240.56 247.90 A: like when you looked for your husband how did that happen like what what kinda did you look for 

246.06 246.97 B: um 

246.99 248.96 B: well i 

249.12 251.60 B: i was looking for 

252.10 256.01 B: something that was really important to me was um religion 

255.93 257.00 A: (( yeah mm )) 

256.41 261.20 B: my religion you know kind of guides my life and so 

261.48 268.50 B: um [lipsmack] i was looking for someone with the same religion so that kind of narrowed the field you know [laughter] 

268.18 270.78 A: (( yes definitely [laughter] mhm )) 

268.57 275.74 B: and you know and then um [lipsmack] and then also i was just looking for someone who 

276.04 282.05 B: kinda you know felt the way i did about having a family and um 

282.17 284.45 B: you know being able to focus on 

285.00 289.72 B: me b- i knew i had decided already like i know i wanna stay 

289.75 292.39 B: home with my kids if i can and 

292.39 293.19 A: (( yes )) 

293.11 298.22 B: i kinda just looked for that a lot you know and then of course i mean there's all the 

298.14 303.14 B: physical you know you have to be attracted to him too [laughter] but um so 

300.94 301.91 A: (( yeah )) 

302.18 303.13 A: [laughter] 

303.00 309.53 B: there's all those things but then when it comes down to it you gotta go okay now what's most important and do they have that 

309.29 320.96 B: and if not then you've gotta look somewhere else but we actually met in church and so that was the start of it and then and then we just found out we just found [lipsmack] 

309.43 310.21 A: yeah 

312.05 312.84 A: mhm 

314.22 315.03 A: mhm 

320.95 324.76 B: that we liked each other and [laughter] it went from there 

322.66 323.54 A: yeah 

324.04 325.27 A: (( that's awesome )) 

325.03 325.92 B: (( [mn] )) 

326.53 331.47 A: like i haven't dated much or anything but i know that religion is a big thing for me too 

331.09 332.15 B: uh-huh 

331.63 335.45 A: um if they're not a christian then i will date them 

335.27 336.25 B: uh-huh 

337.14 348.87 B: well that's that's that's good because i mean it's it's good to be friends with people of all you know walks but if you're gonna share your entire life together 

337.18 338.90 A: (( personally you know )) 

345.05 346.05 A: (( yeah )) 

348.89 356.10 B: that's something different you know what i mean you've gotta you've gotta have those same basic beliefs together or you're gonna 

356.12 357.70 A: (( have a lotta problems )) 

356.28 357.18 B: (( you know )) 

357.22 367.78 B: yeah you already have enough problems you know [laughter] if you share all those things there's already you know you get into a marriage and you go 

359.27 360.64 A: [laughter] 

367.94 371.69 B: hey i thought you liked that and they're like oh well 

371.68 380.46 B: i was just trying to impress you you know [laughter] like he like um he sang in the choir the church choir and i conducted the church choir 

373.74 375.22 A: yeah [laughter] 

380.39 387.47 B: and so he like sang in the choir and i'm like oh that's cool you know he likes to sing [laughter] then after we got married he's like 

380.43 381.27 A: oh wow 

387.58 396.61 B: well i did kinda like it then 'cause we were dating and suddenly he's like but it's just not what i really like and i'm going [mn] you know 

390.34 391.40 A: [laughter] 

392.13 392.91 A: (( [mn] )) 

396.67 397.71 A: (( definitely )) 

397.36 406.84 B: you know and and that's like i mean it's fine you know but it's just you find out things about each other those types of things and you you wanna be 

407.11 408.71 B: you wanna know that 

408.95 417.06 B: you've got those basic you know values and trust trust is really huge issue too i definitely agree with you 

412.48 413.15 A: (( yes )) 

417.03 418.01 A: yeah 

417.17 418.77 B: you have to be able to 

419.30 424.21 B: [lipsmack] build that trust and expect it so 

423.40 426.09 A: definitely yeah totally 

426.02 432.48 B: yeah and like in your like in you know any in the dating that you've done 

432.55 433.40 A: mhm 

432.58 435.90 B: um have you found anybody who 

437.07 441.50 B: you would consider maybe in the future you know for 

440.58 442.08 A: [laughter] 

442.27 443.43 A: (( no )) 

443.15 449.05 B: no [laughter] which which is fine because you have tons of time [laughter] 

444.04 445.69 A: i don't think so 

447.86 460.22 A: i know [laughter] there's always time but um no i really haven't they've all sort of been losers i mean they were like religious and stuff but just 'cause you're religious doesn't mean that you're gonna click with them 

453.97 454.98 B: yeah 

459.90 461.65 B: yes that's for sure 

460.53 465.92 A: so um yeah we didn't really have anything in common so it really didn't work 

465.40 466.71 B: yeah 

465.96 478.82 A: so and we were totally different people and um just did not mesh together well so it didn't go well but that's okay [laughter] 'cause it happens you know 

472.09 473.02 B: yeah 

476.39 477.88 B: [laughter] 

478.13 479.27 B: right 

478.99 486.23 A: and it's all i guess it's all a learning process along the way and even probably after you're married you probably learn a lot too 

482.37 483.35 B: uh-huh 

486.37 488.43 A: um along the way 

487.08 488.12 B: yeah 

488.40 489.76 B: that's for sure 

488.49 491.42 A: it's not all there automatically so 

491.35 493.03 B: [cough] that's for sure 

491.67 492.66 A: yeah 

493.06 494.81 A: yeah definitely 

494.74 495.89 B: yeah and 

495.94 496.86 B: i mean 

497.21 501.66 B: dating i think is great because you do get to 

502.14 505.14 B: get to know lots of different people and you 

505.58 510.15 B: you see what you like and you see what you don't like you know and 

508.71 509.54 A: yeah 

510.72 512.11 B: and um 

512.84 514.59 B: i don't know i think 

515.00 516.73 B: a lot of um 

517.22 523.83 B: this is my personal opinion but i think a lotta kids like try to get serious in high school 

521.78 522.54 A: mhm 

523.70 524.68 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

523.88 528.55 B: and you now there's there's a lot of fun things at high school like the prom and you 

528.51 532.53 B: you build up you know all these expectations about 

532.46 534.93 B: you know meeting your boyfriend 

534.75 548.77 B: or meeting you know your husband in high school and that kinda stuff and really not that there's a lotta people that are probably you know mature enough to handle things but just haven't experienced you know 

548.70 554.14 B: a lotta different personalities or a lotta different types of people and um 

553.05 553.97 A: mhm 

554.33 556.47 B: i think a lotta times 

556.54 558.67 B: that's why you know people 

558.95 561.23 B: get married really really young 

561.33 562.47 A: mhm 

561.94 562.97 B: then 

563.11 564.21 B: they 

564.45 570.12 B: they haven't had experiences with too many people and then they are kinda left 

570.15 572.04 B: wondering about 

572.76 579.42 B: what you know what else is out there and i i think that's you know contributes to some of the divorce rate 

579.32 580.49 A: probably 

579.59 581.71 B: that that's out there 

581.30 582.39 A: yeah 

581.78 586.51 B: but so it's good it's good to just kinda you know not take 

586.98 599.95 B: dating so seriously i that's my opinion [laughter] i'm sure i'm sure your parents would just love me telling you this too but i mean [laughter] but um but just not take it quite you know super seriously 

590.04 591.14 A: oh well 

592.52 594.68 A: [laughter] yeah 

594.90 595.98 A: (( probably )) 

596.73 597.62 A: i don't know
