18.51 19.66 A: the first thing 

19.18 20.33 B: yeah 

19.67 25.14 A: um probably the thing that would attract me to them you know right off the bat

37.40 41.32 B: i think probably the number one thing would uh be 

41.53 44.80 B: able to communicate with um and i mean like that 

44.10 45.41 A: yeah 

44.83 47.53 B: kinda goes with humor as well like if

54.42 56.44 B: still but um 

56.41 59.60 A: yeah um what else like what else 

59.69 62.34 B: and i think looks are important too no matter 

61.31 63.36 A: oh of course [laughter] 

62.39 70.66 B: no matter how how much anyone can say it's what's on the inside that counts you probably won't initially find the person mhm 

70.17 76.03 A: right like i i went out with this guy he was my best friend for like two weeks and i do not think he's attractive at all 

76.15 79.33 A: but he he was the greatest guy ever i just could not 

79.62 85.58 A: find anything you know attractive about him [laughter] so it just didn't work out but yeah that's still important 

82.33 83.41 B: right 

85.26 86.25 B: mhm 

85.65 86.86 A: (( i think so )) 

86.87 89.28 B: that's like that's initially and then 

89.41 91.65 B: everything else falls into place 

91.58 92.65 A: what was that 

92.39 95.13 B: everything else falls into place after that 

94.92 99.59 A: yeah pretty much yeah i think so plus like after a while you don't even see 

99.92 104.89 A: their looks anymore like we've been married almost four years and i tell you i don't even think his 

102.36 103.72 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

105.17 107.04 A: his looks anymore [laughter] 

106.12 113.23 B: mhm mhm yeah i i was like thinking i talk about this with my single friends a lot like 

107.76 108.53 A: so 

113.20 124.06 B: i'm going to medical school in the fall and uh i have always just planned on marrying a doctor just because you know we'll have so much in common you know similar 

114.78 115.65 A: uh-huh 

123.03 123.96 A: right 

124.03 131.59 B: you know values and and lifestyle and whatever like that so like i kinda think that that's important too like 

125.83 126.68 A: uh-huh 

130.82 133.86 A: yeah 'cause you guys would probably like work 

134.09 135.27 A: quite a bit 

135.02 136.23 B: mhm 

135.44 137.14 A: so you think so that would be 

137.13 138.25 B: mhm 

137.63 139.71 A: is that why you feel like that's one of the 

139.12 143.01 B: yeah like they're the most like because like as i've 

141.76 142.89 A: (( yeah )) 

143.02 150.98 B: been you know in in high school it was oh none of these people are like me and then i met people more like me in college and then 

150.67 151.81 A: (( yeah )) 

151.17 152.14 B: (( you know )) 

151.94 154.85 A: i think uh something important too is also um 

154.89 169.88 A: looking before you get married if if see if they wanna have kids or not [laughter] 'cause a lotta my friends got married and like she wants the kids and he doesn't and it's a major issue like you know two or three um years down the road it's a big deal you know [laughter] 

159.69 160.81 B: mhm 

167.50 168.39 B: right 

169.78 170.95 A: so but

197.63 198.47 A: (( [mn] )) 

199.90 210.43 B: yeah i'm at right now i'm at a an old women's college so like when they said life partner like i automatically thought of of gays 

203.67 204.65 A: oh 

210.18 211.24 A: oh right 

210.45 214.94 B: because like that is the term you know like they don't call

219.20 220.02 A: right 

221.62 222.69 A: [laughter] 

221.80 226.39 B: you'd never you'd probably never call your call your husband an l. p. 

226.16 229.99 A: that's true like that is true do you think they were talking about that 

229.84 232.81 B: i i think they were just being generalized 

231.52 233.39 A: just saying whatever yeah 

232.83 234.49 B: you know and like being 

233.98 235.99 A: i was like oh no [laughter] 

236.37 238.20 A: yeah um 

239.30 243.47 A: yeah we live in an area that's like mostly like gay 

243.39 244.36 B: mhm 

243.56 252.38 A: it's kinda nice 'cause i feel safe [laughter] you know it's just i just it's a nice area and you know there's not trashy people walking around and stuff so [laughter] 

245.59 246.82 B: mhm 

250.96 252.04 B: right 

252.15 253.17 B: right 

252.57 256.18 A: but um are you in arizona or what 

255.17 257.09 B: oh no i'm in pennsylvania actually 

256.47 260.10 A: oh okay okay i'm in arizona so i was just wondering if it was state wide or 

258.60 261.13 B: yeah oh that's exciting that's exciting 

261.14 262.94 B: how you done this before or 

262.58 267.44 A: no actually i was online and i just saw it and i was like hey we could use some money [laughter] 

266.74 268.76 B: uh-huh [laughter] i know i saw that too 

267.81 272.77 A: so i was like hey 'cause we just moved we moved uh from pressick which is like two hours away 

272.39 273.24 B: oh 

272.99 277.19 A: and we moved here like uh three weeks ago four weeks ago 

276.76 277.75 B: mhm 

277.60 282.93 A: so yeah it's kinda crazy right now but [laughter] but 

278.03 278.70 B: oh 

280.67 282.42 B: right right 

282.74 283.67 B: right 

282.95 286.77 A: anyway yeah and that's probably another thing is like someone who can adapt well 

286.70 287.81 B: right 

287.18 293.51 A: 'cause we've been going through some crazy stuff like just having a new baby and moving and and like my husband's still like 

293.53 302.28 A: i i feel like i'm the person who can't adapt [laughter] and he's totally like like easy to deal with and you know so that's it's a good thing for me to look for someone who's 

296.82 297.90 B: mhm 

298.67 299.76 B: right 

301.95 304.53 B: right balancing each other out

304.59 306.04 B: mhm 

305.67 308.45 A: yeah but we're pretty similar too so 

308.11 310.72 B: mhm i think it's a balance of 

310.65 311.65 A: yeah 

311.10 316.56 B: and not dissimilar but then like you know being able to make 

313.54 314.68 A: right 

316.08 318.46 A: i always thought i was gonna have to marry someone 

318.52 329.62 A: um like my mom 'cause she's totally opposite of me and i thought i need someone who's gonna keep me in line [laughter] but i ended up marrying someone who's who's more similar to me i think in that area like as far as 

323.22 324.82 B: (( mhm )) 

325.07 326.56 B: (( [laughter] )) 

330.15 335.99 A: i don't know like i'm just get up whenever and stuff and he's that way too so [laughter] it's nice

350.91 354.35 B: so i'm curious as to where you met your husband 

351.69 360.07 A: [laughter] um he actually lived about an hour away from me and my cousins lived in the same area and they were friends with him 

359.84 360.89 B: mhm 

360.22 371.61 A: and so um we kinda just hung out you know every once and a while when i'd come up to visit and he it was kind of a standing joke we were just like oh he's so cute you know we'd always joke around about it [laughter] and he liked my cousin 

371.90 373.05 B: oh wow

455.42 456.39 B: uh-huh 

456.69 459.87 A: so i i don't know i think that was really important for me 

459.53 461.10 B: mhm 

460.37 463.32 A: to marry someone of my religion 'cause i'm jehovah's witness 

461.88 463.11 B: yeah 

463.52 464.50 B: yeah 

463.63 465.66 A: and um you know

474.71 478.02 B: date and then marry a mormon 

476.63 484.17 A: right right yeah plus like um sex before marriage is a big deal you know in my religion too so 

483.87 485.08 B: right 

484.48 489.44 A: so i didn't wanna you know get involved with someone who'd been like sleeping around and stuff like that so 

488.83 490.36 B: mhm 

489.95 491.83 A: that's was kinda important too
