119.64 132.14 A: we're in synch now and we agree with you know because we have a child too you have to deal and communicate and not argue with each other in front of our son 

123.28 124.27 B: yeah 

127.23 128.25 B: yes 

131.88 133.22 B: yes 

132.57 136.64 A: [laughter] which is and you gotta keep 

137.30 143.51 A: [noise] things intact so you know th- they because kids know and they play off to you you know 

138.73 139.75 B: yeah 

143.22 144.64 B: oh yes yeah 

144.02 145.14 A: [laughter]

145.27 146.17 B: well that's 

146.39 155.13 B: yes we i have two of 'em and it's you know the thing is it's worth you know you've got to agree on the way you discipline them too because 

148.36 149.21 A: uh-huh 

154.68 156.94 A: exactly [laughter] [noise] 

155.48 168.27 B: w- with my ex wife she would if i if i disciplined the kids she would tell me when i got home from work you need to discipline the kids i would discipline the kids and then right in front of the kids she would get on my case 

159.97 160.89 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

167.81 168.84 A: yeah 

168.44 176.17 B: and that you can't do that we even had a counselor say you need to stop doing that because that's showing your kids they don't need to mind their father 

175.57 176.69 A: right 

176.37 181.29 B: and they actually mind me better now than they do her now that we're apart [sigh] 

181.40 182.83 A: oh that's good 

182.10 184.10 B: so yeah and um 

183.67 186.01 A: is tha- are they with you or are they with her 

185.62 195.76 B: they're with her they're with her but i think they're wanting to come live with me because she's chosen alternative lifestyle that i don't agree with and the kids don't agree with and [sigh] 

186.58 187.98 A: yeah 

195.51 197.22 A: yeah 

196.50 198.06 B: you know it's it's 

198.12 204.61 B: you know another thing i look for in a life partner now that it you know of course since i have kids is somebody who'll respect my kids too 

204.30 206.44 A: [noise] [noise] oh yeah i'm sure [noise] 

205.70 214.22 B: because i was dating a girl who had three kids and i respected her kids but she never showed my kids an ounce of respect 

213.39 214.11 A: (( oh )) 

214.31 215.57 B: and 

214.36 221.11 A: well if you're going to merge [noise] two households that [noise] doesn't work [laughter] [noise] [noise] [laughter] [laughter] [noise] 

217.41 225.13 B: oh oh definitely definitely and uh you know just the er the communication is the best key 

225.23 232.90 B: because if you can't communicate you won't last i'm surprised me and my ex wife lasted eight years 'cause she has no communication skills 

227.49 228.93 A: [noise] right [noise] 

229.06 233.20 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [laughter]

388.78 398.16 A: yeah it's i think it's all worth it in the end i mean we're still i mean we're deciding do we want to get a home that's already built do we wanna build 

389.36 390.72 B: and 

397.53 398.84 B: mhm

424.32 425.34 B: [laughter] 

426.15 436.44 B: but but in the long run it's good because you got a i mean i don't know how much you guys pay a month for your rent there but right now we live in a one bedroom apartment and we're paying three hundred dollars a month 

436.24 437.95 A: (( all right well we're [laughter] )) 

436.76 437.81 B: so 

437.97 446.01 B: you know y- you gotta figure at the end of a year there's over you know round four thousand dollars going to waste 

445.30 448.29 A: (( oh i know that's not yeah and )) 

446.00 457.12 B: that that if you buy your own home you're like wow we're saving money by buying our own home yeah you might pay a little more [sigh] with your mortgage but at least at the end of the mortgage 

457.08 459.27 A: you get tax breaks and 

458.54 459.99 B: yeah 

459.44 469.00 A: yeah that's what appea- [laughter] when they were talking that really opened my husband's eyes uh oh yes [laughter] so 

465.88 473.94 B: [laughter] yeah and i mean just just agreeing is another good you know relationship 

473.95 476.91 B: option 'cause if you can't agree on anything then 

477.14 480.00 B: [sigh] that's not somebody to be a life mate with 

479.48 480.81 A: right 

481.40 483.92 A: that's true [laughter] 

482.92 484.24 B: but

497.99 498.75 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

498.99 505.01 B: i i had a chance to do one where i would sell local businesses in my area websites and whatever 

504.54 505.45 A: uh-huh 

505.04 510.91 B: but the guy who was supposed to train me and everything and eventually after three years i would be partner 

510.52 511.46 A: uh-huh 

510.85 521.93 B: um never got off his duff and showed me how set appointments how to go out on appointments he just kind of gave me the overlay of the business but never trained me the way he said he was going to 

516.29 517.39 A: oh wow 

521.57 522.86 A: yeah 

522.24 533.28 B: um 'cause it it sounded like a pretty good business deal um i'm thinking about calling him back and saying look i can't screw around and you need to show me how to do this business or we i can get it up and going for myself 

532.68 534.33 A: yeah 

533.61 547.60 B: 'cause i mean it's you make thirty percent commission on everything you sell plus all's you do is you typeset the words into the website and he's got over two hundred templates he's uh partnered with microsoft
