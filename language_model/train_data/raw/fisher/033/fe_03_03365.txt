195.11 209.35 B: you know and this goes along with looking what do you look for in a partner i think that if someone is dating around that you know they're they're kind of not focused and i i i guess i look for a a partner that is focused and [sigh] and uh 

208.12 209.45 A: i think you're right 

209.25 219.96 B: you know and [sigh] and if they can stick with one person and not get overly distracted and into a lot of different things then you know maybe they can stick with the relationship too 

220.05 221.19 A: mhm 

220.12 225.02 B: um and that's that's another you know strong quality that i look for 

225.10 226.62 B: um in a partner

415.50 416.57 A: mhm 

416.20 421.54 B: and um you know taking my time to get to know them and [sigh] and um 

422.03 427.38 B: you know [sigh] it's it's um [sigh] i try to [mn] also look for someone who in 

427.24 440.06 B: a good quality in a partner is [sigh] someone who doesn't want to jump right into an an involvement and that inclu- you know well will do well engage 

435.99 437.45 A: mhm 

440.15 441.22 B: um 

441.42 449.49 B: in a situation where it's it's more public [sigh] not not being like in the limelight or anything but [sigh] but just you know [sigh] 

447.04 448.70 A: yeah yeah 

449.39 459.34 B: um will do more of a courting you know long period of time doing that [sigh] because that really shows that um [lipsmack] 

459.38 472.75 B: you know that they're okay with you know with themselves and they're they they can be [sigh] in the long run they they can be secure with themselves and and the relationship [sigh] that they don't need to have this big involvement right away 

461.27 462.62 A: mhm 

472.67 474.13 A: mhm 

473.43 482.94 B: you know and uh so i look i look for you know like someone who's nice and can be patient you know [laughter] 

481.17 484.42 A: right and it takes time to get to know somebody 

484.11 485.75 B: yeah 

484.77 488.31 A: and sometimes you think you know somebody and and you really don't 

487.80 489.13 B: sure 

488.66 490.86 A: so it does take a little bit of time 

490.42 492.32 B: (( sure yeah )) 

491.05 493.78 A: and i i b- i know what you're talking about just [sigh] 

494.05 499.45 A: spending much many times in different places doing different things and and just discovering 

497.42 499.07 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

499.62 503.48 A: sometimes you find you like some things you never though you did 

502.73 506.13 B: (( mhm mhm right [laughter] right right yeah )) 

504.60 506.38 A: mhm [laughter] 

506.43 517.94 A: i guess that's probably best way that people find out if they make good friends bef- and i think that's one thing you need to be is is friends before you can have a relationship 

519.45 528.12 A: i hear a lot of people he's he or she is my very best friend which i think is is a wonderful quality if you have that in a in a partner 

527.53 529.06 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

529.22 537.88 B: [lipsmack] yeah and yeah definitely being uh best friends is a a great quality to to look for [lipsmack] in a partner [sigh] 

536.40 537.63 A: mhm 

537.83 549.69 B: and uh if it turns into worst enemies [laughter] that's a quality to stay from in a partner [laughter] [laughter] 

540.57 543.92 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] that's )) 

546.82 547.87 A: right
