85.76 88.45 B: or is not happy with what they're doing 

88.56 92.31 B: um so if i find that if a man

101.21 103.03 A: (( yeah i know what i mean that makes sense )) 

101.33 104.30 B: because a lotta men don't like women 

103.85 109.11 A: well like like women like they are friends with women you know good relationship with their mothers and you know 

108.57 109.84 B: right 

109.13 113.06 A: that type of thing yeah 'cause i've dated both and there's a big difference there

115.42 117.60 A: yeah or just yeah 

117.16 122.83 B: and when they hate their mothers they hate every women walking you know alive [laughter] 

121.36 128.24 A: they don't yeah i'm thinking of like [laughter] my last boyfriend just don't don't treat women like women with as much respect and see the 

128.74 136.14 A: you know i guess the importance of like how to maintain a relationship with a women 'cause they didn't get along with mom that type of thing so never saw 

132.73 133.73 B: uh-huh 

136.55 139.82 A: so didn't have that didn't have any girlfriends just friends 

140.10 141.05 A: (( so )) 

140.87 145.12 B: well i i like a man that has uh friends women as friends 

141.37 142.35 A: that makes sense 

144.34 146.71 A: yeah you want that well to a certain point 

146.87 151.76 B: oh yeah because though it in a way they learn a lot and they get a lot of advice 

147.00 148.31 A: [laughter] 

150.12 151.60 A: mhm 

151.90 166.82 B: whereas they'll get if they have a lot of male friends they're gonna get a macho kind of advice if they you know if they were they have a problem better relate- the relationship this time usually when they have good women friends most of the friends are jealous and they have their own agenda 

155.72 156.84 A: that's true 

166.92 170.52 B: uh they get very good advice of how to treat you 

170.14 172.10 A: that's true that's very true 

171.36 173.88 B: like send flowers [laughter] 

172.55 180.42 A: mhm or how to rather than like yeah a guy's ad- advice compared to what a woman would give a guy is completely different 

179.96 183.74 B: it really is and it's much more insight of how to treat a woman 

180.93 181.94 A: so 

183.88 189.96 B: um i like um i i must have honesty and more importantly a great sense of humor 

189.75 192.75 A: yeah that's true i agree with both that 

192.14 193.84 B: yeah and 

192.95 197.44 A: or just a similar sense of humor even it's not great so you get each other's jokes and 

196.83 201.77 B: right or he appreciates your your sense of humor [laughter] 

197.50 198.37 A: 'cause you 

199.51 205.60 A: yeah ap- that's that's good that ends up being very important i think 'cause if they don't understand you're joking half the time 

203.10 203.97 B: uh-huh 

205.87 215.47 A: you end up you know like if it's you make a joke they don't get it all the time whether it's their sense of humor or not if they don't understand your sense of humor yeah 

213.11 216.27 B: there's no compatibility then you're not on the same level 

215.86 217.45 A: yeah exactly 

216.82 222.82 B: i hate to be teased i don't know about you i think that um uh very vicious when people 

222.91 229.53 A: to a certain extent i think i get to a certain point and then i'm just i get mad but it's fine with me 'til they get to a point 

222.98 223.98 B: you 

226.49 227.38 B: uh-huh 

230.32 235.88 B: and also um [lipsmack] what's very interesting is uh how you argue with them 

230.58 231.54 A: (( i don't know )) 

237.22 238.17 B: um 

237.25 239.24 A: yeah i'm just thinking yeah 

238.94 243.39 B: if they argue well it's interesting or if they attack 

243.72 245.65 B: (( unless the subject's sex )) 

245.83 249.98 A: (( that that's a very important view [laughter] where did you get that )) 

247.66 248.98 B: [laughter] 

249.27 256.00 B: why don't you talk i've been doing a lotta talking i'd love to get your viewpoint on on the sexual part or whatever you wanna talk about 

252.55 253.59 A: (( one )) 

255.49 258.66 A: [mn] well sexuality compatibility definitely 

258.55 271.33 A: 'cause there's a lotta types and you gotta like i don't know be the same wavelength even just like to do it three times a week 'cause you know only like it once a month then if one person likes one way the other one is not gonna work and 

266.19 267.43 B: [laughter] 

267.89 268.50 B: (( then )) 

271.34 273.71 B: well it's also how selfish somebody is 

273.35 278.66 A: yeah that that holds up a lot to how selfish they are in other parts of the relationship too if they're very 

278.81 281.37 A: sexually selfish they're gonna be a lot of 

281.46 283.16 A: selfish in other ways 

281.53 287.93 B: well also don't you find that if you have a a compatible sexual relationship you're able to put up with a lot of the other things 

287.62 288.61 A: that's true 

287.96 289.74 B: 'cause it's very binding 

289.75 290.88 A: mhm 

291.07 291.89 B: (( you know )) 

292.12 295.41 B: sometimes it's overwhelming [laughter] 

292.57 294.16 A: that makes sense yeah 

294.64 301.35 A: yeah but that doesn't that only lasts in the beginning and after a while it's just that sex isn't as important as it was in the beginning 

300.79 306.21 B: that's right oh also the other thing i can't stand is a a man who's cheap 

301.91 302.80 A: yeah 

307.08 309.16 B: who's tight with money 

307.08 311.82 A: that's true yeah yes tight with yeah definitely i agree with you on that one 

311.55 314.88 B: and when they're tight with money they're usually tight with emotions 

314.55 316.01 A: mhm 

315.17 316.91 B: it goes hand in hand 

316.08 324.32 A: that is [laughter] i keep thinking of like the relationships i've had and i completely agree 'cause my ex boyfriend was tight with money tight with emotions it all kinda led into one 

324.18 329.93 B: did he use the money or the gifts when he was feeling very good about himself 

330.56 331.67 A: um 

330.63 334.17 B: 'cause i had a boyfriend that was very 

334.29 340.29 B: very very strange very strange man i loved him but i didn't like him because there were a lotta things about him i didn't like 

339.88 340.88 A: (( [laughter] )) 

340.31 342.48 B: and he used um 

342.60 348.42 B: when he was feeling very good about himself he'd be very generous but generous in an extremely showy way 

348.54 352.24 A: really no he wasn't like that it was more of 

349.24 350.12 B: yeah 

353.08 355.19 A: he wasn't like that that's interesting though 

354.85 358.74 B: yeah he would show the world with like big gifts you know 

357.75 366.59 A: look what i bought her i bought her this ten thousand dollar ring aren't i great kinda thing yeah where it's more giving him self status than being doing a gesture 

359.30 360.74 B: yeah you're right 

361.40 363.58 B: right right and you know i 

364.87 372.10 B: absolutely absolutely so he's a very weird man [laughter] i'll never go with him again 

369.20 370.55 A: yeah 

371.74 382.74 A: yeah well a lotta times uh you know the fifty dollar diamond ring is a lot more special than the two thousand dollar diamond ring 'cause it just depends how they gave it and i don't know yeah is 

377.66 378.57 B: mhm 

381.32 383.54 B: are you involved now i'm not 

382.75 384.09 A: i'm married 

383.70 386.68 B: oh you're married oh huh 

384.35 386.37 A: yeah for a month 

386.44 388.78 A: for we've been married a month now so 

388.20 393.10 B: oh well tell me about your relationship your boyfriend i mean your husband this is great 

388.82 389.90 A: [laughter] 

391.07 394.83 A: yeah well he's real easy going and that's i don't 

394.86 402.90 A: know we didn't know well i got pregnant when we knew each other three months so we didn't know each other that well pre pregnancy so that's a whole different ballpark but 

398.56 399.48 B: uh-huh 

403.09 409.93 A: um he's really easy going real easy with money 'cause i'm not working right now and and i handle the finances and he doesn't care 

407.41 408.33 B: uh-huh 

410.21 422.18 A: and i i think i need that i went from a really like uptight about money boyfriend to this and i really need that like flexibility where it's not like constantly you spent ten cents on this and that kind of stuff 

415.93 416.99 B: mhm 

421.69 428.86 B: oh i can understand well it really is a you know my from my experience it's um it's very tied up with emotions 

428.96 430.00 A: yeah 

429.01 432.52 B: and uh insecurity and those 

430.82 434.39 A: mhm and control in a way too it's a lot of 

433.99 435.36 B: absolutely 

435.29 442.38 A: it's mine and it's not yours and and you can't really have that in a marriage whereas you know this is all mine and none of it's yours 

437.36 438.29 B: (( uh-huh )) 

442.39 451.05 A: or like you know this piece you know to a certain extent but you can't really if he's working and i'm not working the money has to kinda be ours to a certain extent it can't just be his and i get my allowance 

450.40 451.92 B: mhm 

451.32 453.08 A: and 

452.42 456.58 B: well he's gotta make you feel like you're you're a person not an an appendage 

455.14 459.73 A: yeah eq- yeah not a dependent child i'm equal in the relationship 

458.75 461.41 B: are you are you still pregnant or did you give birth 

460.56 462.55 A: no i have a six month old 

462.39 463.25 B: (( huh )) 

462.76 464.46 A: i have a six month old now 

464.20 467.74 B: oh that's wonderful congratulations boy or girl 

464.77 467.20 A: so yeah thank you 

467.60 468.50 A: boy 

468.15 471.40 B: (( oh okay that's so so how is he as a father )) 

468.93 470.10 A: yeah dylan 

471.17 484.58 A: he's pretty good he's not as sensitive as he's a pretty sensitive guy in general so i thought he'd be a lot more sensitive as a dad and he's not which kinda surprised me but he is real good i think it took him some getting used to he was a little overwhelmed in the beginning 

481.84 482.82 B: uh-huh 

484.36 487.08 B: well it's overwhelming everything at once 

484.88 485.94 A: (( kind of )) 

486.66 498.93 A: yeah it it was for us it was definitely everything at once we from him we moved across country he left like everyone everything and completely changed everything and then we had like a really really colicky baby 

498.57 500.11 B: oh uh-huh 

499.17 503.26 A: so that was r- real intense but 

502.04 506.84 B: does he get up in the middle of the night and um does he not [laughter] 

504.34 512.55 A: no [laughter] no no no i'm not working though so that's kinda like what we agreed on like all right you have to work so you need to sleep i can sleep in the day 

511.18 512.10 B: uh-huh 

512.65 522.44 A: but no he's never gotten up at night we do the thing now every every sunday morning he'll get up with the baby the baby wakes up about six in the morning and he'll get up with the baby and then i get 'til eight o'clock to sleep 

521.98 523.12 B: mhm 

522.51 526.88 A: that's our deal now he gets saturdays to sleep in and i get sundays so 

526.19 527.12 B: uh-huh 

526.92 528.20 A: and that's nice 

527.32 535.62 B: well it's it's whatever works for you that's that's so much part of the relationship of um working things out that there's no anger 

529.23 530.47 A: mhm 

534.02 535.11 A: yeah 

535.78 541.12 A: and agreeing whether yeah it doesn't matter if it's equal or not but it's just agreeing yeah 

539.23 540.69 B: no i agree 

540.92 545.82 B: it really doesn't but the important thing is to really be able to talk to each other 

542.14 543.15 A: mhm 

545.54 546.51 A: yeah 

545.92 550.72 B: and because when you don't it gets internalizes 

550.57 551.62 A: mhm 

550.99 555.72 B: and then there there's gonna be anger and it comes out in very strange ways 

555.73 564.27 B: and all of a sudden you'll explode and he won't know what's happening you don't even know what's happening but it's all inside it's internalizing 

560.50 562.38 A: exactly yeah 

562.69 573.79 A: it's all built up it's all built up yeah yeah and that's what i think i need i need to feel appreciated a lot and i need 'cause i lived with another guy for about five years and that was just kinda 

573.93 582.76 A: i really wasn't appreciated for any of the things i did and really i think i need that as like it's just the way i am i think i'm more needy and i need to be appreciated and told that i'm pretty and 

582.93 587.13 A: feel like i'm something special i guess and so if a guy's just gonna treat you like you're his buddy 

587.49 592.38 A: it's a lot difference than if you know you're something really special [noise] and he's so lucky to have you 

588.63 589.71 B: mhm 

592.67 594.57 A: there's a really loud plane going over 

595.31 599.89 B: well relationships are very hard you gotta work on 'em and work on 'em you know we 

597.11 598.22 A: (( yes ))
