36.88 39.03 B: oh yeah the housing and um 

38.92 41.34 A: [noise] i'm sure insurance [noise] 

39.44 48.08 B: you know bills oh everything went up because um what happened on september eleventh somebody's got to pay for it [laughter] so everybody sort of like um 

44.78 46.52 A: yeah this is true 

48.49 51.42 B: you know happier one end but not you know 

50.91 51.49 A: [noise] 

51.51 55.84 B: satisfied with it too because you know it's expensive living in new york city 

54.81 57.71 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] have you lived there [noise] 

56.13 59.96 B: as well as changes there's a lot more security so you know 

59.25 61.02 A: well that's good 

60.44 66.96 B: yeah it's more safe over here safer than we thought it would be but you know again we're reluctant with what's happening right now 

66.36 69.74 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] and have you lived there the whole time um for a long time 

68.76 69.37 B: (( yeah )) 

69.94 71.80 B: yeah i was born here pretty much 

71.27 73.15 A: [noise] oh you were [noise] 

72.09 76.96 B: yeah and you you live in i guess you're born in massachusetts you live there 

75.46 79.76 A: [mn] [noise] no actually i was originally born in europe in the azures 

79.28 80.56 B: oh okay 

79.93 82.49 A: um [noise] but i've lived here most of my life 

82.21 83.54 B: oh all right 

82.95 86.70 A: um i used to live on cape cod [noise] [noise] yeah 

85.02 89.55 B: (( on cape cod okay out in um that's in long island is that or oh )) 

88.54 90.07 A: no it's in mass 

89.89 93.21 B: okay because there's a cape cod out here too 

90.49 91.54 A: (( [noise] um )) 

92.82 93.62 A: (( oh is )) 

93.46 94.85 B: yeah mhm 

95.23 96.77 A: (( there [noise] yeah )) 

95.53 99.67 B: in boston you know cape cod where the kennedys 

99.71 100.83 A: yeah 

100.19 101.73 B: yeah okay 

102.21 103.15 A: (( [noise] yep )) 

102.99 110.02 B: so um what what changes have uh i bet you guys have done some changes al- also right because 

108.63 109.65 A: [noise] 

110.07 111.17 A: yeah i'm in 

110.36 113.45 B: living in massachusetts in you know pretty much 

113.35 118.54 A: yeah it's in the same boat i mean i think the question was directly how how 

118.81 124.30 A: what changes have we made directly because of it um i think people 

122.86 124.97 B: (( mhm yeah that's what it was yeah )) 

124.62 125.53 A: um 

126.17 129.66 A: i think we're more reluctant to travel less because of it 

129.24 130.43 B: right 

130.20 131.26 A: (( um [mn] )) 

130.52 139.60 B: and here we don't i don't travel as much but then again i when i do when i did go on a plane i went down to california you know you get more like 

139.73 142.02 B: kinda fearful when you're on that plane [laughter] 

141.43 142.85 A: oh yeah definitely 

142.20 146.66 B: as to what you know what's gonna happen and you're even more skeptical about taking flying 

146.46 149.16 A: i think unfortunately we are definitely more 

149.44 152.46 A: prone to check out our neighbor than we were before 

151.99 153.09 B: mhm 

152.59 155.19 A: whether it whether it's just walking or 

155.26 156.61 A: you know on a 

156.67 158.28 A: on a plane or 

158.57 165.36 A: or just to be careful who because we're all pretty much petrified that somebody might be [noise] a terrorist which is awful [noise] 

160.61 162.10 B: you talk to you yeah 

164.35 178.97 B: right right well that that that is horrible it you know does exist and you have to look around your neighborhood and actually know who lives around there around here in new york city it's so huge that um well i live in the suburbs of new york 

166.91 168.40 A: [noise] 

169.74 171.04 A: [noise] 

178.51 179.60 A: yeah 

178.97 184.83 B: so it's not like in the city but still there are a lot of people that you know you don't really know 

184.16 185.59 A: (( [noise] [noise] correct )) 

185.67 191.10 B: i think because yours is the sole community to get to uh to meet a lot of those people next to you 

186.50 188.72 A: [noise] 

191.68 192.93 B: and um 

193.21 195.97 B: but over here it's a little more like everyone 

194.44 198.51 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

197.22 201.51 B: there's a lot more people here of all different kinds i would think 

200.74 203.20 A: [noise] [noise] yes [noise] 

201.52 206.65 B: you live in in a certain type of community like you'll have all more italians in one or 

206.14 208.56 A: no actually it's um 

208.80 219.72 A: it's you know it's definitely a seasonal community becoming more and more year round [noise] but overall it's [noise] it's really a variety of people because it's mostly people that [noise] are retired [noise] and this is their summer home 

211.30 212.11 B: mhm 

216.05 217.04 B: oh okay 

219.62 222.15 B: oh okay do you have older folks down there 

219.95 220.90 A: where they 

221.57 226.64 A: yeah [noise] i'd say our our community is mostly [noise] um older people 

225.74 233.13 B: elderly people which is probably more safer yeah [laughter] i would think yeah here you have we do live in a very um 

227.15 227.88 A: (( yeah )) 

228.85 229.96 A: (( yeah )) 

231.96 232.85 A: [noise] 

233.39 243.28 B: uh like we have sections where there's a lot more indians and a lot more sections where there's a lot more chinese and where i live like in near jackson heights they do have a lot of um 

237.97 239.99 A: [noise] yeah 

241.07 243.60 A: (( [noise] )) 

243.44 247.81 B: communities where the indians and a lot of other places where there's chinese 

245.96 248.48 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

247.88 262.21 B: but you know the thing is y- you because you're here i think like for a person like you to come down here would be it would be harder probably for you for you to adjust but since i've been living here you know i pretty much you now you adjust after a way 

248.85 250.83 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

255.24 256.20 A: (( [noise] )) 

262.23 267.13 B: even though after september eleventh even though i never went there i never went to the site 

263.09 264.71 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

266.53 268.21 A: [noise] oh you never did 

267.60 269.66 B: no i never went to the site 

269.81 271.12 B: but um 

271.33 282.23 B: i think if i went to there i'd feel more morbid if i did but i saw it on television and that was even more explicit you know i you know i didn't really want to see the see the rest of it so 

272.39 273.66 A: [noise] 

273.87 274.85 A: (( [noise] )) 

275.79 278.59 A: [noise] yeah [noise] it was awful 

283.51 293.26 B: but um basically more security is around i feel a little more safer because we do have we did have planes flying over in our area 

283.55 284.84 A: [noise] 

285.20 286.30 A: [noise] 

290.73 292.98 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

293.28 294.20 A: (( yeah )) 

293.50 297.62 B: you know i guess i guess the security in the air 

295.05 296.66 A: [noise] 

296.85 299.55 A: [noise] yeah [noise] 

297.95 299.16 B: and uh 

299.50 301.82 B: you know the people pretty much 

300.31 301.48 A: [noise] 

302.20 306.64 B: you know i i was i i'm aware of who lives around me a little more better than before 

306.06 307.12 A: right 

307.04 317.06 B: and um thing is we don't t- new york used to be a friendly place where everyone used to talk to each other now it's a little bit i notice people are not that willing to 

317.09 320.09 B: to talk and be that friendly with anyone you 

317.57 318.43 A: (( [mn] )) 

319.14 326.23 A: right well new new yorkers have never been friendly to begin with [laughter] [laughter] 

320.56 322.48 B: keep to your family and 

322.98 331.59 B: well it was it was but [laughter] you know a lot of people think from the outside it isn't but it you know have you ever lived in new york have you visited 

328.14 329.49 A: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

330.35 331.65 A: hm no [laughter] 

331.68 344.49 B: you've never visited but it is a friendly place it's just that people are so busy that they in the past that they never had time to talk but now it's you know they could be busy but they also you know you don't know what they're planning [laughter] 

343.88 344.88 A: right 

344.42 352.48 B: so it's a different kind of fear like and uh so you don't really talk to too many people as easy as before you know 

352.38 359.44 B: you don't meet you stay with your own family members and pull in maybe a few of your relatives and maybe a couple of friends that you have 

354.24 356.33 A: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

359.51 360.32 B: (( you know )) 

360.79 366.22 B: but um as far as security going on trains and everything going to work by train 

363.08 363.94 A: [noise] 

366.42 368.20 B: which i do it's uh 

367.08 367.65 A: (( [mn] )) 

367.70 368.29 A: (( yeah )) 

368.30 369.21 B: you do 

369.23 370.39 B: you know you do 

370.41 374.44 B: kind of fear that something would happen in a train or something like that but 

374.47 377.82 B: you try it's gets less over time i don't think it uh 

378.30 379.88 B: you know you don't think about it 

380.20 385.81 B: because if you did you'd go you go crazy you know [laughter] um i think you know like everybody 

383.03 383.88 A: yeah 

384.19 385.95 A: [noise] 

386.36 387.51 B: you know it's 

387.63 389.92 B: it's pretty much uh feeling the 

389.32 390.60 A: the same way 

390.06 396.18 B: same way right now right even though new york is a site of um concern a little bit more 

396.44 403.41 B: you know because of uh what happened you know it's targeted we feel we're more targeted than you guys 

403.71 407.20 B: i mean that's where the planes right where the planes were taken from 

406.16 409.81 A: [noise] yeah well this is where they derived from boston so 

409.39 413.87 B: yeah so you guys are a little bit more secure in flights and everything i'm sure 

413.54 416.83 A: oh i hope so [laughter] i'm flying next week so i hope so 

414.45 418.13 B: yeah you're hoping now you're still unsure right [laughter] 

417.16 418.65 A: yeah [laughter] yeah 

418.75 423.22 A: yeah i agree i think we've we've both got the same pretty much ideas on um 

423.45 427.31 B: on how we sort of protect ourselves from the the outside 

425.18 425.98 A: yeah 

426.10 426.97 A: yeah 

427.32 435.16 B: basically um i you know i'm i have a couple of indian friends but i'm not gonna say that they're not you know they're not involved with those things 

434.54 436.11 A: right 

435.31 439.12 B: but you know you do kind of you know i saw a lot of bad things happening where 

439.21 442.98 B: where these people weren't talked to because of their race and everything 

442.36 443.49 A: right 

443.07 448.92 B: and you know it could get pretty distorted and sometimes unfair for those those people too 

449.03 453.87 B: you know especially those people that are living here for a long time and they have their own way of living they 

452.75 454.43 A: [noise] 

453.93 456.55 B: (( you know in other words they um worked here )) 

456.93 465.40 B: they got their jo- they've been here like ten years and they're mangers and this and this and you know they they they run into a lot of problems too 

465.65 468.66 B: but um you know i could imagine but um 

469.43 474.52 B: you know you know it doesn't prevent me from meeting those kind of people either you know 

473.49 474.05 A: (( [mn] )) 

475.53 476.70 B: so um 

477.44 480.76 B: what else do we have to say we have a ten minute thing here [laughter] 

480.04 481.71 A: oh really it's ten minutes 

481.32 483.16 B: i think so yeah 

483.47 486.26 B: i think we would hear something after that 

486.45 487.51 B: um 

487.69 488.85 B: (( i guess we have to c- )) 

488.97 490.46 B: continue talking 

490.27 493.93 A: why does it stop you when it's up i this is my first one 

493.00 495.40 B: um oh this is my first one also 

494.87 496.66 A: i don't think you have ten minutes 

496.57 497.57 B: you don't 

497.05 498.60 A: no i don't think so 

498.33 502.39 B: oh you disconnect and that's it oh all right [laughter] 

499.66 500.75 A: yeah 

501.49 503.61 A: (( [laughter] i don't think )) 

502.49 508.21 B: are you sure because it said ten minutes and then they pay you afterwards they credit you 

508.20 511.18 A: oh see i've never i don't know where did you get that from an email 

510.94 513.80 B: um no i got it from the person that i talked to 

513.87 516.66 A: oh okay no so maybe you're right i don't know 

516.49 519.61 B: yeah i think we better you know continue before [laughter] 

517.66 528.77 A: [laughter] [laughter] if you wanted ten bucks you gonna get paid a dollar a minute [laughter] [laughter] yeah but it goes into then it goes into a lottery i think if you keep doing 'em 

520.41 521.89 B: [laughter] 

521.98 526.57 B: (( yeah possibly [laughter] if you're cut short you're right )) 

527.05 527.87 B: i know 

528.20 529.49 B: oh really 

528.86 530.77 A: yeah i already missed one last week 

530.44 537.98 B: oh i think i missed one that same day you know because i heard a machine and i said oh there's telemarketers and they shut it [laughter] 

532.80 534.06 A: on friday 

537.42 541.54 A: yeah and actually it takes a long time you say hello hello hello hello 

541.33 543.18 B: oh there was nobody on the other end 

542.39 544.60 A: yeah and it takes them a while to say anything 

543.99 550.04 B: oh yeah yeah well when it takes that long yeah but you know but at least they give you another chance which is great you know 

549.44 550.57 A: yeah 

550.39 560.81 B: so as far as the [laughter] terrorists what else can i think about um i think we we still can't believe it i guess when when there's something happened we you know like 

551.87 553.84 A: [laughter] 

553.98 554.90 A: [laughter] 

560.80 567.50 B: like in the past when they had the world war two and three whatever two i'm sorry not three [laughter] but this might be three but you know 

564.45 565.77 A: yeah 

566.37 567.32 A: [laughter] 

567.51 581.01 B: world one and two you know during that time i think you know people they just went about like what they're doing now and if we did have world war three you know we just they try to keep optimistic and just keep busy like bush says you know [laughter] 

580.36 581.56 A: (( yeah )) 

581.72 584.75 B: you know i don't know if bush is doing a good job but [laughter] 

584.85 589.01 B: i don't know if a lot of people like the fact that we're gonna go into war with iraq 

584.94 586.10 A: we'll see 

589.04 592.80 B: but um i think uh war is not always the solution 

590.00 590.67 A: i 

592.42 593.89 A: (( right [noise] )) 

593.17 594.73 B: to everything and uh 

595.68 599.89 B: i think something should be should be done but you know in the correct nice
