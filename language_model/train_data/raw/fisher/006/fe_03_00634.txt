15.24 16.27 A: (( [noise] )) 

17.04 23.88 A: well for a life partner i'd like i i think having similar experiences is 

24.22 25.48 A: helpful 

26.65 27.69 B: okay 

28.16 30.13 B: i think honesty is the 

30.19 31.92 B: number one priority 

34.01 37.40 A: [mn] yeah honesty and faithfulness 

36.86 37.77 B: yeah

40.42 42.54 B: i've been married for thirty four years 

42.58 43.85 B: so i've 

43.96 45.26 B: honesty 

45.67 48.60 B: being totally honest and 

48.89 51.97 B: ev- about everything has worked real well for us 

52.20 58.00 A: i'm just going through a really hideous divorce and my husband left me and the kids for another woman 

54.82 55.56 B: (( oh )) 

57.95 61.08 B: uh-oh so there's the faith- [laughter] faithfulness 

62.46 67.39 A: uh yes and i think you also have to be s- selfless because 

62.69 63.77 B: well 

63.89 64.89 B: oh 

68.63 69.58 A: um 

70.63 75.09 A: he said if everybody if he's happy everybody will be happy 

74.48 75.79 B: oh 

75.81 77.18 B: one of those 

77.05 80.19 A: yeah [laughter] extraordinarily selfish human being 

80.02 81.61 B: that's what it sounds like 

81.69 84.00 A: uh-huh and 

84.66 85.64 A: when 

87.26 91.70 A: i think you have to have a real strength of character when you make commitments that you follow through 

91.08 91.96 B: mhm 

94.56 96.27 A: [sigh] yeah 

95.03 102.41 B: like i said we've been married thirty four years and my husband thinks of everybody else before himself he always has so it works real good 

102.30 105.80 A: yes that's that is important i know i 

106.87 112.77 A: i did the same [laughter] but what a big mistake for me [laughter] 

110.81 113.34 B: [laughter] how long were you married 

113.42 115.39 A: oh sixteen years 

114.79 116.39 B: oh a long time 

116.92 118.91 A: yes and he said we had a good run 

119.88 121.34 B: a good run 

121.17 123.15 A: yes it was a good run 

123.25 124.61 B: did you have kids 

124.73 125.97 A: yes 

125.36 126.45 B: how many 

126.81 127.86 A: two 

127.77 130.51 B: and he walked out on them too i guess 

130.84 131.99 A: pretty much 

135.06 138.56 A: pretty much i mean he sees them every other weekend but 

138.27 139.47 B: how old are they 

140.68 143.90 A: daughter sixteen son twelve 

143.51 151.49 B: uh almost a teenager and teenagers are rough too to deal with at any time with something like this i'm sure it's really hard 

151.28 154.68 A: no it's been going on for over two years now and um 

157.62 158.98 A: in the family 

159.52 160.33 A: [mn] 

161.10 164.05 A: children need their fathers regardless of what they think 

163.12 164.68 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

164.84 166.13 A: and uh 

165.35 167.36 B: well then one of the 

168.10 175.03 B: assets to a life partner would be commitment to children too if you plan to have children they better be committed to 'em 

172.50 173.97 A: [laughter] 

174.98 177.50 A: that's that's right yeah 

176.24 177.94 B: better be committed 

177.60 179.11 A: well commitment is 

179.64 181.18 A: it's probably 

182.25 188.78 A: the honesty and commitment and then faithfulness which i suppose if you've got commitment you would be faithful 

188.09 189.72 B: mhm i think so 

190.11 191.46 A: and um 

191.98 194.01 A: a certain amount of maturity 

194.72 199.10 B: [laughter] he wasn't i guess [laughter] 

199.03 200.12 A: (( [laughter] you )) 

201.74 203.04 A: know most 

202.66 205.95 B: i know it's not funny lynn but [laughter] 

204.16 210.23 A: [laughter] no actually i mean it's it's better to laugh at it than what i've been going through um 

214.30 215.40 A: (( [mn] )) 

215.65 219.08 A: i i guess i grew up always being the very responsible 

219.25 224.06 A: one in the family extraordinarily responsible and uh 

221.76 222.76 B: uh-huh 

225.13 230.74 A: so it was good to have someone that was different than that i mean he really knew how to have fun 

231.44 232.99 A: and um 

235.19 237.20 B: does that make him a good life partner 

236.93 247.34 A: well actually it it worked [mn] up until he decided somebody would be more fun than me um it worked it worked well because he would make the plans and then i would 

241.86 243.05 B: oh 

247.50 250.14 A: um follow through and make sure everything happened 

251.21 256.41 A: and while that i don't think is necessarily a life partner it should made life um flow smooth 

255.95 256.85 B: uh-huh 

257.25 260.32 A: but uh having the same values 

260.79 264.14 B: yeah that's real important that's real important 

262.73 263.76 A: mhm 

265.15 267.41 A: yes and i have to say 

267.45 272.85 B: i guess you both when you got married you both wanted kids you both wanted the two kids and all that wasn't a problem 

274.36 275.19 A: oh i 

275.24 284.32 A: we had discussed it and i thought it was okay i got pregnant [laughter] then all of a sudden it became uh-uh not okay 

284.57 289.08 B: so he didn't what did he do decide he didn't want to be a father and husband 

288.30 293.08 A: after i got yeah initially but the number two one was planned 

294.95 296.04 A: so 

297.42 300.90 B: yeah you have to agree on that one too [laughter] 

299.89 306.26 A: oh no absolutely um no you do and if one partner says they don't want children then you don't have them 

305.88 306.55 B: (( mm )) 

306.50 308.06 A: because 

308.61 310.83 B: or else you don't get married to start with 

310.63 315.46 A: no or you go find or you end the marriage there and then and start over 

314.88 315.74 B: yeah 

316.92 318.98 A: because then you're at cross purposes 

319.61 325.73 B: okay it all comes back to the honesty if you're honest about everything then you know right up front what you're getting into 

325.65 337.12 B: what you want what your plans are you know if if you are honest with one another you don't say well yeah i want kids and you say that just so you can get married and then later well no i really didn't want kids 

334.33 336.11 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

336.81 339.43 A: [laughter] 

337.64 339.36 B: what do i hear in the background 

339.97 342.11 A: oh these cockatoos 

342.00 344.05 B: oh birds okay 

343.36 348.50 A: mhm yes i got them i was given them for mother's day
