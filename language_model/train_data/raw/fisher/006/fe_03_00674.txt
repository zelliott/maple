0.77 2.40 B: david kelsey 

2.18 4.26 A: hi i'm karen walker 

4.22 5.07 B: (( hi karen )) 

5.54 6.52 A: how are you 

6.21 7.35 B: good 

6.74 7.58 A: good 

7.97 9.03 A: (( so what do you think )) 

9.85 15.66 B: oh [cough] what do i think um yeah it will help you know um 

16.07 18.36 B: it won't be a total deterrent 

18.50 20.97 B: i think we've got a long way to go to be honest 

21.04 25.26 A: i don't think that there is anything that they can do for people who are 

25.69 27.46 A: willing to die 

27.45 30.90 B: yeah well i think what we have to look at [mn] 

31.09 34.31 B: is like israel and uh their airline 

34.32 35.30 A: right 

34.92 37.37 B: k._m._l. i believe that's what it's called i could be wrong 

36.71 37.74 A: l._l. 

37.40 39.08 B: l._l. yeah and 

39.24 48.59 B: basically look at the shoe bomber richard reid um he tried to board one of their flights just to blow their flight up before he boarded ah one of our planes 

48.51 60.15 B: and he basically came to the conclusion that it wasn't worth it you know but yet he felt that he had an opportunity on on a u._s. airplane you know luckily i think the guy was kind of a moron you know 

60.02 66.56 B: and wasn't trained well enough and he was stopped but obviously the israelis are doing a um 

66.73 73.64 B: better job at um screening the passengers and have better sophisticated means of um 

73.86 80.74 B: interviewing people or of screening the baggage or whatever to deter that because they've never had a plane hijacked 

80.21 81.25 A: right 

80.92 92.23 B: you know so i mean you would think there would be a bigger target there it's just you know it's known that they're so efficient in what they do and we need to incorporate their 

92.40 96.02 B: um quality control into our um 

96.09 98.81 B: our operations really that's what i feel 

98.55 104.01 A: right but you have people who walk around ah walking you know with machine guns and stuff too 

103.68 105.70 B: yeah [laughter] um 

105.16 109.04 A: and are americans ready to do that 

108.79 111.28 B: (( mm i don't know you know )) 

110.80 112.39 A: for safety 

111.83 113.31 B: yeah that's a good question you know 

114.70 116.17 A: because [cough] 

116.58 119.32 A: i don't know that if someone is 

120.18 122.57 A: [mn] willing to die to 

122.61 126.30 A: take an airplane down if there's anything that anybody can do 

126.13 127.92 B: right 

127.53 129.98 A: um to keep them from 

130.35 132.89 A: with all the measures that we could put in 

133.68 135.22 B: yeah and uh 

135.40 139.09 B: there's many better ways of taking them down to be honest um 

139.84 142.59 B: like all the stinger missiles that are missing right now 

142.79 144.70 A: all the wh- i'm sorry all the what 

144.27 145.76 B: stinger missiles 

145.39 146.47 A: right 

145.77 149.91 B: that are missing from the ah um when we helped the afghanistani 

149.96 150.94 A: right 

150.23 151.33 B: freedom fighters 

151.40 158.57 B: they would be under twenty years old and probably non operational but other countries are going to come up to that technology sooner or later you know 

158.74 161.66 B: and it is just a matter of time before they fall into the wrong hands 

161.81 164.88 B: and ah you know that would be 

165.38 168.06 B: (( probably a more efficient way to be honest you )) 

167.90 168.99 A: right 

170.24 171.51 B: know so 

170.89 176.08 A: but i don't know when you have people who are kamikaze and and willing to die and you know 

173.91 174.83 B: (( sure [mn] )) 

177.80 179.28 B: yeah um 

179.09 185.49 A: i think they could take i think that they could take better measures but i don't know that any measure is going to 

186.91 191.58 A: completely assure that nothing is going to happen 

187.97 188.78 B: sure 

191.30 192.90 B: yeah well um 

193.05 194.98 B: yeah no no no ah 

195.53 197.74 B: procedure is one hundred percent effective 

197.82 198.72 B: you 

198.09 199.37 A: i'm sorry i didn't hear you 

199.00 201.78 B: know no procedure is a hundred percent effective 

201.41 202.67 A: right 

202.00 203.04 B: you know so 

203.25 207.68 B: some things will slip through the cracks but i think we need to tighten up our procedures huh 

207.49 212.27 A: oh i yeah definitely so so what can what to do what 

213.41 214.69 A: what more 

214.30 215.67 B: what more can we do [noise] 

215.20 216.44 A: yeah 

217.21 218.15 B: um 

218.34 220.48 B: now that i don't know [laughter] 

219.29 222.86 A: i mean besides leaving our first born there until we get back 

222.37 224.43 B: yeah yeah um 

224.79 226.36 B: that i'm not too sure 

226.69 227.91 B: what we 

226.87 231.86 A: [laughter] if if we did complete background screens 

232.03 234.51 A: and um 

235.91 241.42 A: and everything that has been brought up and mentioned before it's gonna make flying 

241.69 244.48 A: obsolete because no one will be able to afford it 

243.88 253.53 B: right it would be true yeah at what cost does your does the safety outweigh you know for the benefit of the safety outweigh the cost of it sure 

252.19 253.23 A: right 

254.56 256.48 B: yeah that that i don't know and um 

256.67 261.37 B: that's a really good question and i don't know that and i 

260.59 268.71 A: yeah i don't either because you know i mean if you if you really run a background check you're talking about several hundred dollars 

265.65 266.81 B: mhm 

268.30 270.93 B: yeah for each each passenger and all that 

270.35 277.19 A: yeah yeah and if you had just i mean if you add just the several hundred dollars to each plane ticket 

270.97 271.98 B: yeah 

276.51 279.21 B: [laughter] yeah i i 

278.49 281.79 A: i mean how many flights would that stop you from taking 

281.49 283.57 B: oh yeah well definitely 

283.30 288.32 A: and make it not feasible for you to fly and you go okay i mean i can drive this 

289.60 291.75 B: right i hear you there 

291.54 292.52 A: (( you know )) 

292.08 294.65 B: yep i don't know you know 

293.92 299.75 A: i mean especially salesmen and stuff who are not you know who are paid on commission and they are not reimbursed for their flights 

299.37 306.65 B: right yep i th- i myself haven't flown since nine eleven you know not that i fly that much 

305.80 307.09 A: i haven't either 

306.81 309.21 B: not that i fly that much myself in the first place 

309.40 311.51 B: but um yeah it's 

311.83 312.92 B: who knows mm 

312.00 313.72 A: but i personally 

315.57 317.19 A: have 

317.40 318.71 A: since nine eleven 

318.76 322.15 A: i don't know that i would i would have a lot of 

322.31 325.98 A: apprehension about flying now be- that's before when i didn't 

326.14 327.51 B: mhm 

327.78 328.75 A: (( you know )) 

328.26 329.41 B: (( sure [mn] )) 

329.14 330.20 A: um 

330.24 334.77 A: so even though i haven't flown since then if i had of had the opportunity to 

334.25 335.90 B: mhm 

335.75 338.67 A: you know and say either flown or driven 

338.70 339.44 B: yeah 

338.80 344.38 A: which for me driving is a whole lot driving is painfully 

344.40 347.71 A: is painful for me physically to drive because i have fibromyalgia 

347.54 348.30 B: uh-huh 

349.07 351.11 A: but i would still take driving 

351.34 352.37 B: yeah 

351.79 356.45 A: and i would take the three days that i would be in bed recuperating after the drive 

355.82 356.87 B: oh wow 

356.70 358.85 A: yeah so i mean 

358.88 361.76 A: for me it's you know like it 

362.73 364.38 A: is a big thing 

364.27 365.79 B: (( yeah )) 

366.11 367.03 B: (( it uh )) 

367.97 370.56 B: i don't know where all this will end you know is 

370.69 376.45 B: the best defence against all of this is basically um 

376.83 379.62 B: get out of the middle east in general you know what i mean 

379.70 380.64 B: um 

381.60 385.82 B: kind of i think that you know that the more you stir things up over there 

385.87 388.01 B: it's got to come over here somehow 

387.62 390.22 A: (( or not you know we're not going to get out of the middle east )) 

390.26 393.92 A: and even if we do get out of the middle east there's not going to be peace in the middle east 

393.93 398.84 A: if there's no bible there's not going to be peace in the middle east ever you know and 

396.00 398.49 B: yeah yeah yeah 

399.38 400.75 A: you 

400.76 401.88 A: go [lipsmack] 

404.62 406.55 A: you can't argue with that i mean 

408.38 410.55 A: you know it's just not going to happen [noise] 

411.03 418.74 B: as much as you'd like to see it happen i agree with you there it's just too fractional too nutty really 

418.52 420.81 A: yeah [noise] 

419.06 419.99 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

421.18 424.27 A: you've got people who believe that they're right 

424.43 426.83 A: and instead of being like 

427.38 428.67 A: well like i am 

428.73 434.10 A: i can have an opinion about something and just because you have a different opinion doesn't make me feel like you're wrong 

433.85 435.04 B: right 

434.60 438.84 A: it just means that we different su- you know we have different opinions we're different people 

437.16 437.96 B: mhm 

439.49 441.07 A: and we believe different things 

441.15 446.62 A: but that's not how they believe over there you know if you have a different opinion you know you're 

443.07 443.91 B: yeah theyre 

447.05 448.65 A: they'd just as soon see you dead 

448.40 452.35 B: yeah [laughter] yeah yes it's very fanatical 

450.19 451.70 A: (( you know [noise] )) 

452.90 459.34 A: [noise] so but as far as airport security you know i have no idea what more that they can do 

460.04 464.55 B: [noise] yeah but besides just making it so prohibitively expensive that 

463.80 464.78 A: right 

464.86 468.64 B: everybody goes uh rail for mass transit you know 

468.67 474.61 A: right and then what are they going to do with mass transit you know and rail they are going to end up having to do the same thing 

472.27 473.08 B: yeah 

475.88 478.83 B: yes t- t- to an extent yes yeah 

478.89 479.86 A: you know 

479.47 480.61 B: yeah 

480.35 481.34 A: um 

483.52 488.11 A: but you know we had the bus attacks after after nine eleven 

487.71 489.95 B: yeah yeah 

489.66 490.73 A: (( you know )) 

490.10 492.53 B: yes that's true i remember those [noise] 

491.82 492.82 A: so 

493.97 495.27 B: oh then you know 

495.35 498.51 A: you know i private car 

496.46 506.41 B: [noise] homeland security in general with the d._c. sniper you know the fact that they were of islamic faith and all that kinda you know 

502.27 503.46 A: mhm 

506.75 511.85 B: worse things could happen that pop you have one in every state you know as they said um 

510.00 511.29 A: right 

512.26 521.37 B: where all this leads to i don't know you know [noise] 'cause you know we could go over [noise] to the middle east [noise] and take it out in a matter of months i mean 

521.41 523.60 A: and you don't think that's where we're headed 

523.86 529.03 B: um no 'cause i don't think the u._s. population i don't think the um 

529.41 533.72 B: uh people of america would let it happen to be honest with you let it happen 

534.08 535.45 B: you know um 

535.74 538.80 B: 'cause bush's popularity is waning right now 

538.98 542.46 B: um pretty hard and there's a lot of um 

542.60 551.95 B: anti war sentiment out there and really we're the only nation that besides england you know which will support us in anything we know that that 

552.17 553.12 B: (( um is )) 

553.22 556.02 B: wanting it to be honest you know 

554.72 555.95 A: right 

556.38 558.49 B: [noise] all of our allies are kinda saying [noise] 

558.65 561.70 B: (( you know this is almost gunboat materialism [laughter] )) 

562.18 563.53 A: right 

562.62 571.66 B: and if you go in there and decide to take out the whole entire middle east which i obviously you could very easily um [noise] but at what cost you know 

571.94 576.30 B: you know they'll they'll come back and hit us with something [noise] there's no way they can't 

577.51 585.56 B: [noise] then the big question is you know if you fight a war you should win something right [cough] what would you would you have won [noise] 

582.77 584.17 A: exactly 

585.43 586.41 A: um 

586.90 587.76 A: well 

587.94 589.01 A: it's whether 

589.84 594.09 A: you know it's been something that's been going on for a long time 

593.56 596.01 B: yes that's true 'cause you know um 

596.24 598.90 B: i agree with you there um 

599.35 599.95 B: because
