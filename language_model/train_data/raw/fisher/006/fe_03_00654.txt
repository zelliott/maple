175.73 176.18 A: yeah 

176.99 177.93 B: oh wow 

177.97 180.11 A: just remembered that now that i am thinking about it 

179.82 181.98 B: (( )) my sister works for um 

182.15 186.23 B: an insurance company and they were supposed to be flying out of newark on that flight 

186.98 187.41 A: yeah 

187.05 192.02 B: also it it's something and the lady that was supposed to make the reservations forgot 

192.65 193.07 A: yeah 

192.66 192.94 B: yeah 

193.61 195.54 A: i think that's the type of thing that happened to my 

195.87 197.31 B: yeah see that's eerie 

196.31 196.74 A: that's like 

197.75 198.34 A: yeah that is 

198.56 198.86 B: like 

198.94 199.26 A: hm 

199.04 200.41 B: somebody was watching over 

200.74 201.15 B: (( )) 

200.84 202.03 A: definitely 

201.58 202.16 B: yeah 

204.08 204.53 B: huh

224.04 224.52 A: (( )) 

224.66 226.61 A: i had just knocked over a bunch of books 

227.29 228.22 B: oh no 

227.96 230.14 A: i'm making messes 

230.55 232.97 B: so you are walking around or what 

233.50 234.93 A: i don't know i was just sitting down that's 

235.26 236.55 A: probably the scarier part 

240.48 240.96 B: hm 

241.60 245.01 B: i don't know what else what else are we supposed to talk about besides nine eleven 

242.25 242.51 A: yeah

253.55 254.63 A: yeah 

253.57 255.69 B: and i think it will for a for quite awhile 

255.98 257.08 A: absolutely i agree 

257.18 259.10 B: i don't know if it depends on your age like 

259.38 260.88 B: some some teenagers 

261.30 262.28 B: i don't know if if 

263.06 264.27 B: they'll be thinking about it 

264.64 265.37 B: next year 

265.85 266.48 A: yeah 

266.21 268.05 B: like we will be we probably will be 

268.65 269.09 A: yeah 

270.40 270.97 B: and it is 

271.08 273.63 B: it is upsetting to to still see it again or 

274.15 274.75 A: definitely 

274.61 275.56 B: thinking about it 

275.74 276.99 B: i went to um

312.74 313.21 A: yeah 

313.00 314.30 B: to be there to hear

397.05 401.41 A: it's not uh they are going to have lots to look at 

400.56 401.96 B: i wonder how they um 

402.09 403.31 B: match people up or they just 

403.46 404.44 B: choose them at random 

404.86 405.32 A: yeah 

405.52 407.27 A: it's probably something to do with just the times 

411.06 411.93 B: talk about my dog 

412.19 416.65 B: -cause i don't have a dog i don't have a pet i would have to say no
