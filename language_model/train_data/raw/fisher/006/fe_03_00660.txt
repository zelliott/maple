60.08 61.59 A: it just surprised me 

61.80 62.76 B: yeah me too 

63.09 65.36 A: i mean the first one i thought maybe it 

65.46 67.78 A: might have been an accident but then the second one 

68.32 69.37 A: then i knew something 

70.86 71.91 A: you know something

91.63 96.80 B: being uh on the east coast i immediately was was afraid 

96.36 98.99 A: i imagine because you're a lot closer than i am 

98.51 99.82 B: right 

99.34 102.27 A: and i'm not in located near any big city so 

102.41 103.19 A: you know it 

104.10 106.20 A: i have a lot of family members that live 

106.96 109.13 A: out in california and in florida 

109.22 109.70 B: uh huh 

109.87 110.72 A: but none 

111.19 113.44 A: up towards new york or washington or anywhere 

113.63 118.25 B: right well philadelphia is halfway right between new york and d._c. so 

117.22 119.57 A: yeah so you're you're really close 

119.61 122.17 B: yeah i started looking out the window and 

119.71 120.02 A: (( )) 

121.92 123.62 A: oh i imagine it would be scary to 

124.18 126.38 A: think of something like that that's pretty close 

126.62 130.62 B: yeah it re- it really was and the strange thing is that um 

130.72 136.41 B: the day before that i had uh friends come visit me and they had they were supposed to be on a plane 

136.85 141.47 B: from uh d._c. to uh seattle that day 

141.36 142.43 A: oh my goodness 

142.07 152.21 B: so i was worried about them but the day before we had walked (( )) i was showing them philadelphia and we walked through the city looking for the tallest building we could climb to get a view of the city 

152.20 153.64 A: oh man 

153.49 155.35 B: so it's very strange 

156.03 157.03 B: do you think that um 

157.33 158.80 B: that it's changed you 

159.25 159.94 A: uh 

160.11 160.94 A: i don't think 

161.11 162.60 A: n- not a lot 

162.70 164.14 A: just maybe you know i 

164.71 166.21 A: i try to stay around my family more 

166.56 167.13 A: and you know 

167.32 168.54 A: communicate with them more 

169.07 169.64 B: right 

169.21 169.59 A: and 

170.74 174.00 A: you know i really don't have to worry too much i don't think about 

174.47 175.21 A: (( )) 

175.48 177.29 A: out for terrorist act (( )) 

177.43 177.87 B: right 

177.71 181.52 A: you know cause it's such a small town that i don't think that anybody would try anything 

181.88 183.00 A: you know there's not enough 

183.24 184.53 A: people here to in 

184.96 185.41 A: you know 

185.84 188.71 A: like a big city you know something major could happen 

188.88 189.48 B: yeah 

189.66 191.36 A: has anything changed for you 

191.81 192.40 B: um 

192.83 196.72 B: not i mean right at first i think it's sort of worn off you know 

196.84 198.98 B: but uh i mean at first i was um 

206.03 213.30 B: (( )) but i don't you know i don't feel afraid now or anything i did for a little while cause i thought philadelphia might be hit 

212.95 214.88 A: oh yeah that would be scary living there 

213.46 214.16 B: good target 

215.06 215.58 A: thinking 

215.17 215.57 B: yeah 

215.73 217.06 A: that's you know a pretty 

217.93 219.30 A: popular city and 

219.70 221.65 B: yeah and there's also the you know the 

219.84 220.12 A: (( )) 

221.78 223.46 B: the statue of liberty here so it's got 

223.77 226.40 A: yes that's a major yeah 

224.35 225.43 B: some symbolic 

226.53 226.99 B: yeah 

226.64 227.11 A: um 

228.01 228.47 A: (( )) 

228.04 228.37 B: but i 

228.60 229.36 B: yeah i don't think 

228.96 229.39 A: go ahead 

230.19 230.57 B: what 

230.73 231.37 A: go ahead i'm 

231.84 232.96 A: i interrupted you 

233.41 237.96 B: um i yeah i don't think that like my day to day life has changed in any way 

238.19 238.83 B: because of it 

239.01 242.84 B: i you know i do think that it has changed uh the general 

244.04 246.02 B: like political climate of the country 

247.37 248.15 B: you know and 

248.26 248.61 B: and 

248.29 249.61 A: i think that they should 

250.05 252.63 A: the only thing it's really changed i think they should put more 

253.11 253.73 A: um 

253.86 254.76 A: security points 

255.21 255.54 A: and 

255.78 257.80 A: you know and just try to count at what's more 

258.77 259.25 A: uh 

259.53 261.71 A: activity that's going on in the united states 

261.98 262.62 B: right 

263.38 264.31 A: so far as i don't 

264.80 265.32 A: think 

265.47 267.16 A: anything else for me has changed 

267.49 268.11 B: right 

268.36 274.38 A: you know immediately after i was kind of scared cause i was thinking you know they was going to attack the whole united states 

274.92 277.42 A: the other plane that went down in the field and 

277.77 282.80 B: right and do you matter that they were saying that they there were unaccounted for planes somewhere 

281.66 284.92 A: yes so it makes you wonder then 

284.95 285.53 B: yeah 

285.11 287.41 A: i mean i was scared right afterwards and you know 

288.09 289.00 A: felt re- you know 

289.10 289.62 A: bad 

289.92 290.52 B: yeah 

290.80 291.32 A: um 

292.32 296.68 B: didn't it seem like there was this just sort of this blanket of gloom hanging over everything 

296.46 296.99 A: yes 

297.37 298.49 A: you know cause there was a 

298.95 304.12 A: lot of people that died and i'm sure that there was probably everybody from every state that knew somebody 

304.24 304.78 B: yeah 

305.45 306.34 A: there was so many 

306.57 306.84 A: (( )) 

307.55 308.10 A: um 

309.84 314.32 A: that's about all i can think of that's changed for me that anything else that's changed for you 

312.38 312.93 B: right 

314.70 315.18 B: um 

316.58 326.70 B: no i i i mean do think like like you said just uh staying in touch with your family my sister lives in new york so i was i was very worried about her i was really relieved when i got in touch with her but i do 

326.95 331.01 B: i do think something like that makes you realize how important family is 

331.12 333.31 B: and i think for a lot of people it um 

333.41 335.28 B: not for me personally but 

335.42 341.77 B: i remember hearing about a lot of couples that either decided to get married or to break up 

341.27 342.55 A: yeah right after 

352.00 354.88 B: have the same whether they're supportive that kind of thing 

354.27 354.96 A: oh yeah 

355.60 359.57 A: i don't see why anybody would well i mean i could see some people doing it but 

359.79 360.78 A: you know that may have been a 

361.28 363.18 A: affected really closely by it 

363.58 364.81 A: me myself i don't think 

365.30 367.81 A: that i would have changed now i was already married anyway 

367.77 368.45 B: right 

368.27 368.73 A: and 

369.54 370.42 A: i don't think i 

370.59 372.00 A: i would have went and jumped and 

372.22 373.81 A: got married and all that 

374.12 380.22 B: uh huh yeah it d- it d- i heard i heard a lot of stories though about people who thought you know well 

380.63 382.46 B: you know i don- or who people who were 

382.96 387.33 B: uh who were together and and didn't like how their partners uh 

388.55 389.48 B: reacted or 

389.65 390.26 B: you know 

390.04 390.54 A: yeah 

391.08 393.32 A: i could see uh probably a lot of people that 

393.79 394.17 A: their 

395.00 400.16 A: boyfriend or girlfriend was in the military maybe getting married you know thinking that maybe they would get shipped off 

398.93 399.65 B: right 

400.87 401.45 B: yeah 

402.04 403.97 A: that's what i was afraid we was going to go into 

404.29 406.46 A: to war maybe they was going to attack us 

406.73 408.58 A: that i mean that's another thing i probably was 

409.54 412.09 A: scared about thinking that they was going to attack us on our 

412.54 412.80 A: our 

412.90 413.68 A: our land 

413.76 414.33 B: right 

414.30 415.30 A: and that's scary 

415.85 417.72 B: it does i i don't know i've always kind of had this 

418.05 418.62 B: feeling like 

418.74 419.99 B: uh the united states 

420.90 424.72 B: like we kind of live in a bubble like we're so you know we have the two shores and we're so 

424.85 425.57 B: far away from 

426.00 428.97 B: you know we don't have to worry about canada or mexico 

427.92 428.90 A: yeah 

429.30 429.79 B: um 

430.10 431.70 B: and you know i think it kind of like 

431.87 433.70 B: burst a bubble for me of 

433.82 437.05 B: of feeling safe here like noth- nothing could come through 

437.22 438.71 A: yeah but safety is kind of 

439.24 440.54 A: in- invaded on 

440.66 441.28 B: yeah 

442.19 444.77 B: but i you know like i say i think that feeling is kind of 

446.23 447.74 B: worn out you know i i do feel 

447.98 448.33 B: safe 

448.69 449.16 B: now 

449.45 451.18 A: oh i feel safe now i mean 

451.96 452.28 A: about 

452.38 455.04 A: safe you know because i know that i'm from 

455.16 460.03 A: an area that i don't think anybody even knows some people that would try to attack but um 

460.52 463.88 A: right after you know i did feel a little scared but i don't feel scared now 

464.21 465.05 B: no me either 

464.31 465.04 A: um 

465.18 465.50 A: i 

465.86 466.92 A: i still feel kind of 

467.34 467.99 A: angry 

468.57 469.06 B: right 

468.57 469.75 A: at at the 

470.70 471.58 A: people that done it 

471.92 472.47 A: uh 

472.77 475.10 A: just cause i feel sorry for the families that lost 

475.66 476.32 A: loved ones 

476.67 477.07 B: yeah 

476.78 478.62 A: my dad died not too long after 

478.91 479.49 A: after that 

479.59 479.84 A: so 

479.68 480.69 B: oh i'm sorry 

480.58 481.11 A: um 

482.17 483.90 A: so you know i know how they feel losing 

484.12 487.10 A: one but i don't know how they feel losing one to terrorist acts 

487.33 490.22 B: right yeah it just seems so senseless 

487.71 488.08 A: so 

490.70 491.53 A: yeah and 

492.44 492.87 A: i mean 

492.99 493.65 A: other than that 

494.71 495.01 A: (( )) 

495.70 496.00 A: i 

496.39 496.72 A: (( )) 

497.62 499.70 A: i don't know what good it would be to be angry 

500.92 501.63 A: because 

502.07 503.35 A: i mean they can't find 

504.52 505.58 A: the people that 

506.15 508.08 A: done it because they're they're dead 

508.08 510.11 B: yeah they they're dead 

510.03 514.92 A: and we don't know for sure who was behind it all you know and they say that 

515.69 516.35 A: um 

516.84 518.58 A: i can't think of his name now 

518.30 519.43 B: osama bin laden 

519.16 522.16 A: yes they say that he was behind it but i think there was more than just 

522.64 523.15 A: him 

524.12 524.88 A: behind it 

524.35 524.87 B: yeah 

525.26 527.21 A: i mean they can't just blame it on one person has
