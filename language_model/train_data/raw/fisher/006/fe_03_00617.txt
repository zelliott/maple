25.70 26.10 B: yeah 

26.56 27.08 A: why

39.59 40.12 B: so 

40.24 40.87 B: christmas 

41.23 45.59 B: probably because we actually get guests on that day too and it is like a bigger deal so 

43.58 44.16 A: uh oh 

45.48 46.52 A: oh okay (( )) 

45.71 48.20 B: that would be why how come valentine's day is yours

78.62 79.58 B: that is a tough one 

80.04 85.68 B: i don't know man that is a tough one seriously -cause there is a lot of things that you could have holidays for 

86.22 86.81 B: i 

87.86 91.42 B: i can't think of one like off the top of my head can you think of any

116.66 119.54 B: celebrate someone that i guess that would be my idea 

120.05 121.96 B: so maybe like nelson mandela would be 

122.09 123.31 B: one person i guess 

123.97 129.84 A: okay well then uh i guess i agree but i i think i would probably choose something like (( maybe ))

312.45 312.87 B: which 

313.04 322.84 B: holidays c- came into play when i was thinking about getting a job too actually -cause i mean -cause at night i can only get a job where i'm going to have to work holidays 

323.51 325.71 B: basically -cause i only have a high school education 

326.14 327.02 A: oh really 

327.15 333.42 B: yeah so i was just thinking about that how i am actually lucky i only celebrate like birthdays and 

333.53 334.66 B: like christmas 

335.25 337.88 B: because i'm going to have to work all the holidays probably 

338.37 340.20 A: oh yeah and that's hard because 

340.98 343.62 A: other people want to be off that is right 

343.01 343.42 B: mhm 

344.44 345.20 B: but so 

344.52 344.79 A: well 

346.25 351.33 B: birthdays actually i i should say maybe birthdays like my kids birthdays are probably my favorite holidays 

351.55 352.87 B: the holidays you really don't 

353.41 355.25 B: consider a holiday but i do 

355.01 355.50 A: mhm 

355.99 362.06 B: so that would actually be my favorite -cause we get to do whatever you know whatever the kids want basically for their birthday 

363.21 364.63 B: as long as we have the money i guess 

365.86 366.68 A: well but 

366.90 368.28 A: being fired that is i mean 

368.84 371.36 A: just see i have little kids (( they are always like that too )) 

371.64 373.15 A: well my kids are two and three 

373.82 375.35 A: so um 

376.60 380.07 A: you know but it can be expensive (( )) and other kind of stuff but 

380.13 380.95 B: mhm 

381.21 381.76 B: heck yeah 

382.29 383.92 B: that is why mommy needs a job 

385.86 388.12 B: to afford the holidays 

388.91 390.49 A: so are you married 

390.44 395.94 B: yeah i'm married for um five years a little over five years 

396.06 397.95 A: oh five years oh that is good then 

397.29 397.63 B: yeah 

399.03 399.51 B: yup 

401.20 401.71 B: um 

403.08 404.03 B: how old are your kids 

404.80 406.42 A: how old are my kids 

406.09 406.53 B: yeah 

406.54 407.57 A: my son 

407.71 408.82 A: my son is 

408.93 411.47 A: i guess and three and a half he will be four in april 

411.93 414.14 A: and my daughter has just turned two in september 

414.74 416.34 B: uh isn't it like having twins 

415.16 415.49 A: uh 

417.36 419.94 A: it's kind of like that -cause they are like 

420.06 420.72 A: um 

421.05 422.39 A: they are seventeen months apart 

422.83 423.32 B: right 

423.69 424.75 A: so i mean 

424.93 426.29 A: it was tiring but 

425.49 427.92 B: mine are fifteen 

428.37 430.31 A: and so they were they really 

430.94 434.27 A: were growing up together so i mean i guess that is pretty good 

434.64 435.15 B: mhm 

435.08 436.27 A: and 

436.45 437.74 A: i just don't have to 

439.21 442.56 A: just don't want any more kids where i have to just start all over again 

443.08 445.17 A: when i'm just really getting the feel with them 

446.27 447.69 B: i can oh i'm done too 

448.93 451.16 B: i was glad the day that they were both uh 

451.26 452.81 B: the last one was out of diapers 

453.98 458.24 A: ach i know i mean -cause i was sort of like a (( )) 

458.43 460.44 A: going and buying 

460.61 465.59 A: i was buying pull ups for my son and buying pampers for my daughter but well no actually 

464.26 465.64 B: and that is hard 

465.89 467.87 A: no actually actually 

468.32 469.34 A: at birth 

469.49 470.73 A: i was buying 

472.28 473.15 A: pampers 

473.26 474.25 A: two packs of pampers 

474.56 475.01 B: mhm 

474.73 477.61 A: -cause he wasn't probably ready for pull ups yet so i mean it was like 

478.16 481.03 A: pathetic you know how i'd run (( )) always going in like 

481.15 484.30 A: buy three different packs of pampers and i was like oh my god 

484.32 486.17 B: that is when it really feels like they are twins 

484.49 485.50 A: but then 

486.82 492.66 B: seriously -cause that is when it hurt i think money wise it hurt the most was when they were in diapers 

487.21 487.60 A: yup 

494.30 494.82 B: -cause 

494.34 497.80 A: well we got past that and then we went to just pull ups 

498.30 503.57 A: for her but i have her potty trained now so thank the lord i'm not with any of it 

504.19 506.78 A: and you can really see the difference you know and now you just have to 

507.28 510.78 A: get baby wipes you know just to keep their hands clean or whatever 

509.31 509.95 B: mhm 

510.94 514.08 A: but i mean you could out i can go out a lot more 

511.03 511.31 B: yup 

514.79 521.45 A: and have a pack of pull ups a pack of diapers and some baby wipes and i would (( )) like uh ah 

521.89 522.63 B: yeah 

522.34 523.78 A: something has to give
