65.32 67.58 B: oh there's no pet holiday 

68.07 69.87 B: we should have a pet holiday 

68.27 69.47 A: oh gosh 

69.93 77.79 A: that's a good idea i'm glad you thought of one cause i'm kind of nervous and i didn't hard for me to think right now yeah 

77.68 79.53 B: oh let's see 

78.48 79.10 A: did you have 

79.36 80.33 A: you have pets then 

81.34 85.95 B: well i grew up having dogs and now i have cats cause they're so much easier 

86.30 86.75 A: oh 

87.07 88.60 A: we have a bird we have a parrot 

89.40 91.42 B: oh my cats would love him 

91.12 98.99 A: yeah he screams all the time he drives me nuts but that would be a neat idea though especially for people that really like pets 

100.09 102.26 B: yeah they're they're part of your family 

102.32 105.17 A: yeah yeah they are you don't realize until they're 

105.49 105.92 A: like

112.84 113.33 A: -out him 

116.00 119.67 B: yeah let's see what we call it it would be uh 

123.31 127.07 B: well it's mother's day so i guess we would just call it pet day 

127.20 128.39 A: yeah guess that would have 

127.87 129.98 B: and you get presents for your pets 

130.93 132.64 B: big shopping uh
