0.00 1.23 A: hello 

0.85 2.16 B: hi there 

1.89 3.17 A: my name is ken 

3.28 4.84 B: hi my name is andrew 

4.53 5.64 A: hi andrew 

5.95 15.07 A: i've been asked this question a lot uh i think um along with doing surveys like this on the phone i do a lot of surveys on line uh through emails and stuff 

14.92 20.34 B: (( mhm )) 

15.37 18.62 A: and that's one of their favorite questions and and i 

19.09 25.98 A: i haven't made any changes but even even if i had though i think i would answer that i hadn't 

26.06 28.24 A: (( uh because i i think that's )) 

28.28 39.29 A: part of of uh how i feel that we can respond and we're not gonna tell some we're not gonna exaggerate anything and say something oh you know i'm more afraid than i am or whatever you know but 

39.19 43.46 A: i actually haven't made any changes it really hasn't hasn't affected my life at all 

43.78 50.10 B: you know i felt that same way um i have noticed some of the changes i live on the west coast in california so 

49.73 51.00 A: yeah me too 

50.82 54.70 B: physically i was separated from the actual events however uh 

53.37 54.23 A: yeah 

55.45 67.42 B: [mn] you know the the changes that have come about uh because of them have been sm- have been small and you know slight but they kind of add up to a sort of um 

68.24 77.58 B: kind kind of like a like a small little wave that comes over it like um for instance one of the small things was uh i had to ride the uh metro train to get my school every day 

77.67 81.09 B: and uh that's it's called bath and uh 

81.68 93.88 B: one of the things was they shut down every single restroom [laughter] throughout the entire system and i i know somewhere some want to do that in the name of security but they kept them shut down for about six months 

84.37 85.55 A: wow 

90.88 91.61 A: yeah 

93.34 94.31 A: yeah 

93.93 106.38 B: and that you know i i was kind of disgusted by a lot of the things that happened uh the bathroom really got me because you know how are you gonna shut down bathrooms you know just to save a few bucks in the name of security but also um 

106.63 118.30 B: things like uh the whole car promotion that just wouldn't stop the you know keep america rolling [noise] you know that that really affected my perception of what happened you know i i want to believe things have changed for me but 

118.39 127.26 B: i don't think they really have you know at first you know letterman was like oh you know things have changed no-one can be funny and all these things were just happening all over the place and um 

119.72 120.65 A: (( yeah )) 

127.34 140.87 B: they were like everyone wondered if you know things would be you know the same ever again but it seems like things have settled into exactly the same way they were before and now the mindset's like okay now it's going to stay this way permanently things are never gonna change so 

134.52 135.33 A: yeah 

139.68 140.86 A: (( that's right yeah )) 

140.80 143.07 B: to me that's how things have changed 

142.05 147.93 A: yeah it just it just changed my viewing habits you know i just watch t._v. more that's all you know [laughter] that's about it 

148.36 149.33 A: [laughter] 

149.28 153.70 B: yeah actually t._v. like i i've gotten myself into a 

153.88 156.72 B: a more rigid television structure uh 

156.24 157.02 A: yeah 

156.60 170.37 B: i'll watch you know maybe like some whatever i we're kind of watching fox now because fox has a lot of stupid programming it's mindless and it's kind of fun you know they have that man versus animal and it was so stupid and mindless but 

167.18 168.03 A: yeah 

168.22 175.88 A: well i i actually i actually watch the news more that's what i'm watching i'm watching the news about the terrorism war that's what i'm watching but 

175.17 187.47 B: yeah i was gonna say the same thing we watch something stupid then we watch the news and then we watch letterman it's our stupid very important news every single day ten o'clock you know the good st- solid hour for news and then uh 

176.56 177.32 A: yeah 

179.97 180.77 A: yeah 

185.67 186.48 A: yeah 

187.49 193.51 B: and then something stupid again also on my radio i've set uh a bunch of presets i've set all my a._m. stations to uh 

188.70 189.56 A: yeah 

193.52 195.48 B: purely news stations 

194.94 196.15 A: yeah 

195.63 203.34 B: and uh whenever anything happens anything at all i always you know go right to the a._m. radio station so i can find out what's going on you know 

202.80 203.57 A: yeah 

203.74 206.26 B: and there's always you know alerts on the radio so 

203.93 204.73 A: yeah 

206.01 211.89 A: i i find myself watching news on t._v. all the time oh i just have the news on all the time it's really strange 

210.91 212.76 B: (( uh-huh )) 

212.52 213.81 A: but that's it 

214.34 215.36 B: [laughter] 

215.16 217.34 A: you getting many calls or 

217.30 222.98 B: um yeah at first uh i wasn't sure how to end the calls so i i took like three or four of 'em 

222.33 223.52 A: yeah 

222.97 233.05 B: and uh the sys- but we weren't sure how it's supposed to end so the system gonna it will cut us off after ten minutes and say thank you but we just have to talk- talking till it says thank you 

229.81 231.01 A: oh okay 

232.99 235.55 A: we do so you do have to stay on for ten minutes 

235.04 241.15 B: do have to stay on yeah i found out the hard way because i had done like a whole bunch and apparently they didn't count because we didn't stay on for the full ten minutes 

240.77 242.57 A: oh bummer 

242.22 244.34 B: so yeah 

243.67 250.02 A: okay yeah this is my like my sixth one but we always just shut off really quick so 

249.99 259.80 B: yeah that's that's the way i was doing it at first and then i call them because no one i talked was really sure about how it was supposed to work we finally [laughter] figured out you know um okay this is 

259.99 266.10 B: uh something's not right here because no-one was getting inf- any information so we finally i finally called them and found out oh 

266.08 276.29 B: that the uh you have to wait for ten minutes until it says thank you it was funny because the lady i talked to was living in tennessee and uh i connected to her like three separate times just the way this has been set up 

268.43 269.24 A: okay 

275.83 278.52 A: yeah i got some lady twice yeah 

276.41 277.28 B: then 

278.38 281.48 B: and uh it's because we didn't wait until it said thank you so 

281.20 281.90 A: (( no )) 

281.83 284.03 B: anyway [laughter] 

282.98 289.25 A: that's fine i i don't mind as long as they told us that up front i would i would do it you know but if they don't tell us up front there's no way you can know 

287.29 288.48 B: yeah 

289.20 297.75 B: oh now a lot of us were confused because nowhere in any of the messages or anything we got did it talk about you know oh you have to you know wait for this full ten minutes but anyway 

293.95 295.00 A: that's right 

297.17 298.57 A: that's right yeah 

298.61 300.23 A: i agree 

300.00 306.45 B: a lot of folks need to know [laughter] i actually i found out about this whole survey thing from u. penn 

301.39 302.79 A: yeah really 

306.89 309.83 B: like from a deal website [laughter] 

309.75 310.67 A: wow 

310.53 312.66 B: yeah that's pretty funny but um 

312.97 323.78 B: anyway back to the conversation [laughter] uh security and all that i i notice a lot of stupid security for small things very small things like our traffic court here 

314.87 315.72 A: yeah 

323.82 327.08 B: has this just minor security system set up now 

327.19 335.79 B: and you [mn] tax dollars at work you just can't believe it they make you take off your shoes and your belt before you even go into the building for anybody 

335.73 337.02 A: wow 

336.55 342.03 B: and it's just they they had this like ninety year old man taking off his shoes and his belt in the name of security and i 

342.14 345.25 B: again it was to the point of ridiculousness for me so 

345.24 346.13 A: (( yeah a )) 

346.18 348.90 A: lot of people going way overboard that's for sure 

348.75 354.72 B: yeah um but it it's nice to see that things are loosening up a little bit i was at the airport a little while ago and uh 

354.76 356.02 B: things were 

356.28 358.64 B: a little bit milder than they [laughter] were to begin with 

358.69 367.32 B: uh folks were definitely you know a lot looser the whole federal um security thing at the airports that really um 

367.66 370.26 B: one of the things about that was 

370.75 378.31 B: that you know they were gonna get rid of all the original screeners and here in bay area apparently the screening system was very good but it was all um 

378.52 382.78 B: people who weren't officially u._s. citizens they were they had green cards but they weren't citizens 

382.34 383.74 A: yeah 

383.02 388.93 B: and uh they all got fired and they were excellent screeners and they had no problems ever but 

389.14 396.30 B: they had to put those federal guards in and now all the federal guards you know having the problems and everything and so i don't know i'm just [mn] 

396.28 404.64 B: as far as the security goes it [mn] it's kind of [mn] to a point anal [laughter] 

403.13 405.26 A: yeah that's right yeah 

404.90 408.43 B: and i'm just and and now the way things are going with uh 

408.51 416.08 B: you know in in the name of anti terrorism we have you know the off uh total information awareness in the offers of homeland security it's just 

416.49 421.87 B: it seems like i hate to the be paranoid you know you know person you know 

422.56 433.14 B: ra- [laughter] shaking things up but it it's seems like it we're we're beginning to slip into like a ninety eighty four type situation here i'm not liking it i'm just 

431.21 432.10 A: yeah 

433.21 437.38 B: you know i'm certainly not the paranoid you know information nut but 

437.69 451.73 B: this some of the things here are very scary and also i just heard on the news today that uh bush was talking about some strategic office i think it was called strat commerce and they were talking about deploying nukes in the war that we haven't even decided to fight so 

452.57 454.22 B: (( [mn] )) 

454.03 465.22 A: well it's they have to do something you know and you have to support whatever they do because that's that's what they're for you know there's no sense in in electing somebody and then not giving them any power so [laughter] it's 

464.83 466.77 B: no no i agree with you totally 

465.95 467.37 A: yeah yeah 

466.67 480.27 B: i think you know if bush kind of slipped up in his days but uh i'm sorry not bush clinton clinton should have done something when he was in power but uh i i think you know they definitely need to do something they need to get rid of the whole you know saddam's regime over there 

471.42 472.20 A: yeah 

473.25 474.39 A: yeah 

480.07 480.84 A: yeah 

480.11 484.23 B: that needs to be changed out that's just a matter of fact and uh 

482.78 483.58 A: yeah 

485.28 491.92 B: and you know you you can't claim that we need to do for oil or whatever that's garbage you know we're always going to need oil we're always gonna need that stuff no matter what you do 

491.55 492.77 A: yeah 

492.24 498.95 B: we're gonna have to change it but there's just no changing it so we gotta do something now i don't think nukes are the answer though [laughter] i don't think 

498.89 509.60 A: well i don't know i've i've heard a lot about uh tactical nuclear weapons you know in field in the field for not not mass destruction where you're gonna wipe out a whole city or anything but 

509.18 510.33 B: (( right )) 

509.68 517.81 A: tactical nukes uh you know for limited use i don't see any problem with that if it's gonna be used in the field just against military targets that's 

517.77 530.54 A: we're not we're not talking old technology you know where you're gonna drop 'em from ten miles up and then wipe out half the country we're not talking that you know i wouldn't wouldn't be in favor of that either of course not you know that's just mass destruction that's what we're fighting against 

525.41 526.34 B: yeah 

530.92 533.03 A: but uh tactical nukes 

532.28 539.82 B: i actually i'm gonna claim ignorance because i do not know about the weapons they're talking about all i know is that they were talking about using nuclear type weapons and that's 

539.95 551.39 A: well well i i don't i i when they when they say that um i've heard that too but they had they had tactical nukes in in uh the theater in ninety one for the gulf war too they just didn't use 'em 

550.93 552.30 B: (( [mn] right )) 

551.38 560.31 A: but um i don't know and they probably won't use 'em this time but uh for for the strategy that that they could employ i i would be in favor of it so 

560.48 564.04 B: yeah well whatever gets the job done i guess [mn] 

562.78 569.37 A: yes that's right that's right exactly don't don't take any weapons away from them don't take any of the things that they have options away you know 

569.44 574.07 B: yeah no no no definitely i mean um it's very important that it gets done 

574.13 575.75 B: really it is i mean 

577.15 578.82 B: [mn] 

579.50 589.84 A: well i don't know i've i'm lucky i'm from southern california and and i don't i'm far aware removed i grew up on the east coast so i feel for 'em but uh 

589.42 590.61 B: mhm 

590.81 599.95 A: uh we don't think out here that it affects us because it because it doesn't because they're not here you know it hasn't happened to us maybe when it does maybe everybody's gonna change their minds but
