55.31 62.38 B: and i have had thoughts of things like gee i i you know they say you should have three days worth of food and water and stuff 

62.59 65.45 B: stock piled and i have some stuff but i haven't really 

66.43 68.22 B: made that jump what about you 

69.89 76.67 A: well i don't live that close to you but i think that the thing that the change it's made for me is that everybody in my family is more 

77.09 80.64 A: let's say let's say they're more important you know and i try to be closer 

78.55 79.23 B: mhm 

81.69 87.65 A: and you're right though i i'm afraid more to going to public places for a long time that's starting to go away but 

87.75 90.46 A: yeah i um was really afraid of that for a long time 

89.76 90.18 B: yeah 

90.60 91.89 A: but mostly i think it just 

92.06 93.53 A: each day i'm more aware that 

93.64 99.04 A: it may be taken away from us you know and i just appreciate everybody i love oh so much more 

95.01 95.74 B: yeah 

98.22 101.74 B: i think that i does make a a lot of us you know say wow you know 

101.83 106.13 B: what really matters and uh and i did actually change my career since then but i can't 

106.23 109.18 B: i wouldn't say it's as a result but i did switch into teaching 

109.66 110.05 B: um 

110.32 112.90 B: which is a lot more fulfilling you know to kind of 

113.45 114.36 B: i think a lot of people 

114.53 116.69 B: said okay you know what am i doing with my life 

117.38 118.17 B: and um 

117.49 118.02 A: yeah 

118.46 120.81 B: maybe made some changes as a result 

121.52 128.64 A: when you see on the news 

128.14 128.49 B: i don't 

129.06 130.51 B: i feel more um like 

130.69 133.34 B: fear than hatred and um 

134.06 134.78 B: you know 

135.30 139.05 B: i mean those those two individuals i think are yeah solid evil and and 

139.64 141.01 B: uh i i guess i do feel 

141.55 142.19 B: like they are 

142.29 145.42 B: people that deserve to be hated and you know smited and 

145.65 147.36 B: gotten off this planet but um 

148.23 148.76 B: you know 

149.34 151.64 B: i guess it's more like i'm just scared that 

152.69 154.25 B: like that they have smallpox 

154.38 162.83 B: and that that's why and the president knows it and that's why they're so hell bent on war and it's like man smallpox would really really be horrible 

163.61 164.97 A: oh my gosh yes 

164.32 167.97 B: so that that frightens me um well it's interesting i teach 

168.29 170.25 B: english as a second language and in one of my 

170.39 171.27 B: classes about 

171.44 174.09 B: three quarters of the students are women from afghanistan 

175.17 175.97 A: oh my 

175.22 180.32 B: and so that's really well we they don't have enough english even to talk about that and i wouldn't really 

180.60 182.61 B: want to talk about that with them but 

182.79 185.98 B: you know when i think of afghanistan those are the folks that 

186.17 187.06 B: i think of 

187.82 189.13 B: and not like 

189.59 191.25 B: osama you know what i mean 

191.38 194.22 B: you you get to know these really delightful people 

191.54 192.14 A: mhm 

194.76 195.21 B: um 

195.31 196.12 B: even you know 

196.22 196.82 B: they they 

197.46 200.45 B: they don't feel that way towards america that's why they're here as refugees because 

200.93 201.81 B: they're escaping 

202.16 202.88 B: from that nightmare 

203.68 209.39 A: do you feel awkward when you're talking to them though like you have to avoid different subject because you know we're so aware that 

209.62 211.22 A: they're from these countries and 

210.30 216.23 B: yeah i mean it it's difficult because uh uh part of what i'm supposed to teach them is how to get a job and how to 

216.40 218.03 B: act in the workplace 

218.12 225.20 B: and uh i need to sort of prepare them for the fact that if they do if they cover their heads with a scarf uh you know which is part of their religion 

225.37 228.47 B: that they may be the victim of you know um 

229.15 233.15 B: uh people saying negative things or treating them a certain way 

233.26 237.42 B: um you know it's kind of hard um or one of them this one man last summer was like 

237.65 245.96 B: his name was mohammed he's like that's such a bad name because of mohammed atta you know and he was a you know a nice man he felt like this was a mark on him to have this 

241.89 242.51 A: right 

246.17 247.33 B: this name 

247.50 249.55 B: so it it is kind of awkward 

251.05 255.20 A: i know that it i think it affected us financially too in that we had stocks 

254.65 255.60 B: (( oof )) 

255.29 258.93 A: and then when all this happened the value of the stocks went down for awhile and 

257.67 258.43 B: yeah 

259.04 269.65 A: also i work as an independent contractor doing different jobs and a lot of the jobs were located in downtown cleveland and i couldn't do the jobs naturally because the police wouldn't allow access 

269.07 269.64 B: wow 

270.16 271.76 A: to the federal buildings down there 

271.43 272.48 B: eh so that did 

273.43 275.00 B: impact you financially and 

275.71 277.49 B: the stocks are still you know 

275.73 276.26 A: mhm 

278.02 281.89 A: oh yeah uh that i can't say is related to september eleventh but 

281.07 284.41 B: but that certainly has caused uh it hurt things lets 

284.53 285.42 B: it didn't help 

286.13 294.37 A: no it just i i couldn't believe that this would actually ever happen to us you know not in my lifetime i thought we were safe we were immune i think it made me more aware that 

286.53 287.01 B: no 

295.61 301.04 A: i don't know i'm afraid to go on a plane that's how it's impacted my life but then i do go but i'm very nervous 

298.18 298.76 B: have you ha- 

300.70 301.87 B: yeah i feel 

302.45 305.62 B: more nervous about flying for sure but i have also 

306.45 306.82 B: um 

306.99 307.62 B: taken the 

307.91 309.08 B: taken that step i mean 

309.68 311.20 B: i keep going but your right i mean i think 

312.33 316.97 B: it gave us like this feeling of vulnerability that we didn't have and it's like ugh you know 

315.07 315.67 A: mhm 

315.94 316.42 A: i know 

317.44 318.32 B: nobody should 

318.86 320.77 B: have that and i don't know it's just 

321.51 323.29 B: it's very disturbing um 

324.94 328.18 B: the security needs to happen but like we went to see the liberty bell 

328.80 329.32 B: and 

329.72 331.64 B: it was like getting into um 

331.89 332.29 B: like 

332.49 335.96 B: top security something they're searching people and searching bags and it's like 

336.07 339.63 B: it's just a bell i mean like you could stand outside the glass 

339.89 341.81 B: and detonate a bo- you know what i mean like it was 

341.94 344.23 B: i i know it's a symbol of our country but it's kind of like 

344.89 348.19 B: the uh i- i- i don't know that one seemed a little bit overblown 

348.51 352.90 B: but at the same time it's like well but what if somebody did harm the bell then that would be very upsetting to us 

353.55 354.04 B: um 

354.20 354.75 B: it's just 

354.98 356.23 B: ah it's just tough 

357.34 362.84 A: right i know i agree yeah i worked at the airport in security for awhile and afterwards it was 

362.94 366.36 A: really t- i mean we all had to be fingerprinted and it was really intense 

365.76 366.75 B: right and now i guess 

366.88 367.68 B: they all have to be 

367.87 368.29 B: um 

368.67 370.19 B: part of the t. s. a. or something 

370.88 371.29 B: they've got 

371.62 374.16 B: new regulations keep kind of rolling out and 

374.93 376.35 A: right right 

375.14 375.70 B: you know 

375.92 376.37 B: and 

377.17 378.48 B: and i don't mind any of that 

378.93 384.58 B: i mean i'm like certainly they can take off my shoes they can do whatever they want you know as long as they're going to keep us safe 

383.74 384.65 A: mhm 

385.51 386.94 A: right i agree 

385.56 386.07 B: um 

386.71 389.70 B: but i i do remember the first time i flew after that 

389.85 390.68 B: and seeing 

391.01 392.39 B: people like you know nice 

393.10 396.55 B: so normal looking people getting you know searched and stuff and i just thought 

397.37 401.00 B: that's what these jerks have done to us you know like look what they're making us do 

401.09 402.32 B: and and it really made me 

401.58 402.17 A: mhm 

402.56 403.83 B: angry and sad 

405.11 406.21 A: right 

405.28 405.97 B: so 

406.96 414.67 A: i don't know i just i'd i i just wish it hadn't happened and my heart still go out to all the people that that died what a way to lose somebody you love right 

414.36 417.29 B: yeah i mean i can't think of anything more horrible and 

417.45 417.92 B: um 

418.68 422.53 B: yeah and that's the thing is like it does keep coming back to you and you just go 

422.63 424.09 B: i just can't believe that day 

424.23 425.39 B: happened i mean 

425.86 426.91 B: like this 

427.03 435.53 B: this past i guess late summer and early fall there was some days where it was just um this gorgeous crisp morning and i remember i'd think to myself 

435.90 440.08 B: it was a day just like this 

440.41 445.40 B: you know i remember driving to work and just going oh it's so nice out you know this is such perfect weather and then 

445.95 446.47 B: um 

446.65 448.77 B: and and so there sh- that kind of thing where it's like 

449.45 454.68 B: everything was so fine and then things got so completely not fine 

452.12 452.83 A: mhm 

454.94 456.89 B: and they're never going to be quite you know 

457.25 457.61 B: same 

457.62 458.19 A: i know 

458.41 460.81 A: it's not the same do you have children and are they free 

459.40 461.06 B: no i'm single 

461.74 462.89 B: so i've sure 

463.04 463.87 B: do you have kids 

464.47 471.80 A: yeah i have kids and they're grown and i worry for them my one daughter travels for business all the time and i always make her call me immediately when she gets there because i'm worried 

471.22 471.91 B: yeah 

472.41 473.43 B: yeah i mean 

474.93 481.55 B: i i think people with children of any age it hits home even more and people with little kids i mean how did they explain this 

482.35 483.55 B: to the kids i mean 

482.86 483.86 A: i don't know 

484.51 486.02 B: that's just got to be heartbreaking that 

486.71 487.17 B: um 

488.13 490.26 B: well and that a six year old should even have to know 

490.42 491.39 B: about these things 

492.60 493.43 A: i know 

493.90 494.91 B: that's just awful 

495.61 495.90 B: but 

496.10 499.73 A: i know i mean and w- just think they're going to have to rewrite history books and everything now 

499.18 501.58 B: yes actually one of my textbooks 

502.02 507.89 B: has a cha- this is one that i'll be teaching from this semester has a a chapter on the world trade center and what it 

508.41 514.50 B: well the topic is not just really the center itself but that bomb that they had back in like what ninety one 

515.03 515.53 A: mhm 

515.83 516.75 B: and i mean 

517.37 521.47 B: it's kind of i mean like it's going to give us another jumping point to talk about but 

522.40 523.57 B: you know it's just kind of like 

523.90 527.65 B: sad or any time i see a picture that has those buildings you just go god like 

528.56 530.47 A: oh i know it still doesn't it makes you cry 

530.07 530.71 B: yeah it's just 

530.82 531.97 A: hm yeah i 

533.11 534.37 B: just so shocking but 

535.12 535.57 B: um 

543.70 545.67 A: want to come into his country and bomb them 

546.05 549.06 A: that we're going to think that what we did to the world trade center was 

549.28 550.38 A: nothing 

550.62 552.79 A: that that's how he's going to retaliate re- 

551.77 552.37 B: ugh 

553.49 557.38 B: that's i mean that's the kind of thing that scares me that there's people out there that 

558.35 558.60 B: that 

559.33 561.05 B: saw that as a triumph and can't wait to 

561.32 562.66 B: you know do something else 

563.47 565.15 B: that just scares me to death but 

566.22 566.61 B: um
