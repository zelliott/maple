0.27 3.19 A: hello i'm ronald henderson 

2.23 4.29 B: hi i'm gaylor kaiser 

5.81 6.84 A: hi 

6.60 7.58 B: hi 

7.81 10.00 A: you know what the topic is [mn] 

9.48 11.08 B: it's about um 

11.14 13.51 B: airport security and 

13.53 14.58 B: (( if um )) 

16.97 21.17 B: they think that the heightened um security will 

21.29 25.21 B: keep from i guess the terrorists from attacking again 

25.75 31.63 A: yeah i'm not sure how much height- heightened security they actually have at this point they have 

30.73 32.16 B: i don't 

32.14 37.89 A: substantial amount around trying to uh check people as they get on on the plane 

37.73 38.92 B: yeah 

38.50 43.06 A: but uh that's about all i know um that they are doing 

43.13 48.30 A: um maybe they are also securing the perimeters more 

48.24 50.40 B: i don't really know um 

50.76 55.50 B: and i think that they are checking checking people and luggage more 

55.08 55.64 A: (( uh )) 

55.84 61.16 A: (( mhm )) 

56.54 58.04 B: though i don't really 

59.15 61.55 B: i don't really know you know 

63.86 69.28 A: o- one of the things i know that they have done is changed all those jobs to be federal jobs 

69.08 71.30 B: yeah i i knew about that 

70.82 76.20 A: and i'm not sure how much help that has been from the sense of of really making a difference 

76.26 79.75 A: it certainly increased the cost of running that job 

79.33 80.42 B: yeah 

80.35 83.68 A: it's made more jobs that are a livable wage 

83.42 84.69 B: yeah 

83.99 88.33 A: as opposed to people that were on a job that wasn't a livable wage before 

87.96 88.99 B: yeah 

88.61 92.26 A: and uh having them do the job should be better 

92.36 98.52 B: yeah i i would think if i would think if the government was doing it now that it ought to be better 

97.98 103.08 A: [laughter] i am not really sure of that though i spent a lot of time in the d._c. area 

100.25 101.80 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

102.22 103.44 B: [laughter] 

103.25 107.44 A: and working with different government agencies in the past and so uh 

107.46 121.70 A: um my experience of that does not give me the greatest uh amount of confidence it's almost like my experience of being in the national guards and seeing those big billboards that said sleep well your national guard is awake 

115.76 116.85 B: [laughter] 

121.10 122.37 B: [laughter] 

121.72 126.67 A: does not make me feel real comfortable [laughter] 

124.06 124.69 B: [laughter] 

125.99 128.61 B: well let's hope they do a better job 

128.75 129.75 A: (( yep )) 

130.57 132.99 B: so but no i um 

133.70 135.48 B: i really don't know 

135.75 138.20 B: how much it's really improved 

137.98 140.24 A: (( yeah )) 

138.67 142.83 B: i know here in mustek you have to get there like two hours earlier 

142.90 154.09 A: yeah where are you at oklahoma right i'm out here in pennsylvania so it's a long ways away um but i um 

144.32 145.82 B: in oklahoma 

146.39 147.23 B: (( uh-huh )) 

149.12 150.11 B: okay 

151.52 152.10 B: (( mhm )) 

154.57 165.30 A: i got through fairly quickly the only time we've flown lately it was but we went in and out of the leha valley international airport which is a fairly close airport in here 

164.65 165.44 B: yeah 

165.24 173.02 A: and they um the uh first leg of our flight was actually a a bus ride into newark 

172.99 174.05 B: (( mhm )) 

173.14 177.16 A: and then when we got to newark they just ran us right on through it 

176.99 177.84 B: huh 

177.41 186.60 A: was rather very quickly um so i don't i hadn't really noticed a lot of difference in that situation have you flown any lately 

186.49 193.38 B: no my sister has and um that she says that they haven't really i mean 

187.81 195.24 A: (( mhm )) 

193.78 196.58 B: it's about the same she said other than 

196.79 199.25 B: she has to get there a little bit earlier 

199.65 200.83 B: i mean they 

201.13 204.31 B: i think they still i think they check her luggage and stuff 

205.51 209.29 B: but she hasn't really i mean she hasn't really told me 

209.82 212.25 B: you know that there's any new 

212.22 217.60 A: mhm [mn] [mn] not anything new about the security there 

212.94 214.76 B: anything new really 

215.74 216.56 B: (( uh-uh )) 

217.93 221.33 A: uh with government employees or no government employees 

218.28 219.16 B: no 

221.07 222.18 B: yeah 

221.57 225.44 A: probably hasn't changed much of anything has it scared you more to fly 

226.76 228.15 B: not really 

228.53 229.67 A: (( no )) 

229.23 230.93 B: not really i think 

230.04 231.85 A: me either 

231.23 233.20 B: (( i think that um )) 

233.34 236.48 B: i think that it could happen again i mean i don't 

236.61 238.50 B: it don't really scare me 

238.36 239.18 A: uh-huh 

239.37 240.40 B: i mean 

240.87 246.57 B: i guess they could i i guess it could happen on a bus or a train just as easily 

246.67 249.74 A: right anywhere where there's a large crowd of people 

248.95 250.31 B: yeah 

250.63 257.89 A: um the thing that was so different about nine eleven is that they were actually using those planes as bombs 

256.62 258.95 B: yeah 

257.92 260.51 A: that was a very different situation 

261.21 264.68 A: [mn] so what do you think of the whole homeland securities 

265.80 267.64 A: department 

268.93 270.16 B: oh i don't 

269.23 271.54 A: putting all those agencies together 

272.43 274.01 B: oh i don't know 

274.38 275.33 A: [mn] 

275.70 281.31 A: and their new rules in order to make sure that everybody's safe i guess that's part of that is even at the airport now 

280.82 281.97 B: yeah 

281.45 283.80 A: you're supposed to leave your luggage open 

283.74 284.94 B: yeah 

284.51 286.65 A: so that people can get into it 

286.25 287.32 B: mhm 

291.51 293.79 B: i don't know i think i think there's 

293.83 296.58 B: there's a lot of improvement that needs to be done 

297.32 299.53 A: uh what would you suggest 

301.02 302.05 B: oh 

303.80 307.31 B: they def- well i think i think one good thing would be to 

307.47 309.41 B: (( to train the um )) 

309.78 311.09 B: (( the um )) 

312.29 314.70 B: the stewardess and the um 

314.72 317.22 B: pilots and all that and 

318.73 319.71 B: you know 

319.77 321.77 B: give them some training or 

322.28 327.34 B: give them some leeway of you know what they can and you know what they can do 

328.22 328.78 A: (( [mn] )) 

328.80 329.51 B: (( um )) 

331.41 335.19 B: i wouldn't i wouldn't say give 'em guns or anything like that but 

335.68 339.68 B: i don't i don't mean it may come to that but 

340.57 341.50 B: i don't know 

340.65 342.77 A: you don't think that they should have guns 

345.39 347.05 B: i've not 

347.17 350.08 B: not right now now if we go to war 

350.40 353.77 B: i might change my my mind 

353.88 358.05 A: (( mhm )) 

353.95 355.45 B: (( but um )) 

357.20 359.27 B: right now it's kind of 

359.36 365.51 B: yeah i think if they do give 'em guns then they should make sure that they're trained and everything 

366.95 371.48 A: yeah i think there's a real difference between allowing them to have guns 

371.50 374.35 A: uh and insisting that they carry a gun 

373.96 375.41 B: (( yeah )) 

375.01 377.94 A: i think those are two different kinds of uh 

378.22 385.49 A: pictures with all of that from a security standpoint frankly personally i wouldn't have any problem with 'em having guns i uh 

381.21 382.21 B: yeah 

384.59 385.76 B: yeah 

385.69 391.23 A: i don't think that the guns are what's dangerous i think what's dangerous is people you know 

392.15 394.61 A: using 'em for bad things 

393.92 395.53 B: yeah 

395.10 396.29 A: and uh 

396.29 401.11 B: well i think my biggest concern would be if they if they weren't trained properly 

401.10 402.91 A: mhm 

401.97 403.03 B: then 

403.70 408.69 B: someone might be able you know to take it away from 'em or whatever and 

408.85 414.10 B: you know so i don't i'm kind of iffy on that on that part 

414.58 418.44 A: so you concern would be that they could safely take care of the gun 

418.20 419.52 B: yeah 

418.97 422.46 A: yeah i can understand that 

423.13 423.99 A: (( i'd do )) 

425.64 429.74 A: most people in in oklahoma carry guns or have guns or 

429.57 431.29 B: yeah 

430.71 433.09 A: there are a lot of guns you sort of holding there 

433.39 435.43 B: yeah we have a um 

435.58 437.46 B: we actually have a um 

437.82 440.65 B: they started a concealed um 

438.78 444.15 A: (( right )) 

441.26 446.39 B: weapon law you have to register it and well they always had to do that 

447.88 448.89 B: (( and um )) 

450.31 457.30 B: you can carry it concealed if you have a i guess like a concealed weapon certificate or something like that 

457.75 458.63 A: (( mhm )) 

458.14 459.86 B: i'm not really sure 

460.50 463.17 A: (( yeah )) 

464.48 468.13 A: what else do you think we should be doing for airport security 

468.78 471.40 B: oh well i know um 

472.47 475.53 B: at the um main airport here 

475.98 481.88 B: they have it where you can't um used to you could park in front of the airport 

481.94 484.12 B: and now you have to go park 

484.51 486.72 B: i think that's a good idea 

486.79 487.52 B: um 

493.10 494.47 B: (( just um )) 

494.98 496.84 B: i i think they need to 

497.47 500.43 B: look more and be more cautious i've heard 

500.58 502.84 B: i've heard like on the news people 

502.86 506.39 B: passing security and all that i think they need to 

507.81 510.92 B: look more look more at their security and 

517.46 520.68 A: just try to do whatever they can do to make it better 

519.19 521.43 B: yeah yeah 

523.75 524.33 A: (( mhm )) 

524.38 526.83 A: so how important is security 

527.06 529.31 A: compared to convenience 

530.77 532.98 B: i think i would rather um 

535.01 537.62 B: i think that security would be more important 

538.30 539.06 B: (( um )) 

539.65 543.87 B: at least that way we knew that you know we'd be safe and 

547.68 551.36 A: how much are you willing to allow the government to uh 

551.52 555.91 A: really have access to your life in order to be more secure 

555.94 561.69 A: 'cause that's one of the things that's happening with uh the whole homeland securities rules and regulations 

561.74 564.98 A: is that we're moving more into an era of where uh 

565.40 569.84 A: the government has you know doing all kinds of tracking stuff on people 

569.88 571.23 B: yeah i think 

572.26 577.21 B: i think that we've you know we we still need you know we still need that privacy 

578.20 578.82 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

578.24 579.30 B: (( um )) 

582.48 586.17 B: i don't know i guess it would depend on the situation i don't you know 

587.07 588.28 B: i don't know 

590.12 593.83 B: i think i think that we still you know we still need privacy 

594.90 596.55 B: (( so i don't know ))
