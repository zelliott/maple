49.21 52.64 A: um i i found that um my son recently flew in 

53.16 54.25 A: from virginia 

54.80 55.20 B: uh-huh 

55.06 57.83 A: and i could have easily gone and claimed his baggage 

58.39 61.07 A: i was right there in and out 

58.49 58.86 B: oh 

61.34 64.95 A: i think that the closer you get to um boarding 

65.69 74.09 A: the tighter the security is but in terms of saying that the airport itself is safe it is not perhaps the planes are 

74.50 78.75 B: oh also too i think the terrorists are much more sophisticated 

79.40 79.89 B: um 

80.50 82.92 B: and even if the security 

83.46 88.66 B: uh that they have in place as far as screening etcetera is uh tightened 

88.81 89.53 B: i don't think that 

89.77 90.21 B: (( )) 

90.88 95.77 B: that would matter at all anyway i think that the terrorists are much more sophisticated than anything we have in place 

96.02 97.67 A: that is right um didn't they just 

98.09 99.78 A: arrest a pilot for 

100.61 102.10 A: taking a gun on board 

102.33 105.09 B: oh gee i didn't see that yeah i didn't see that 

102.47 103.45 A: how did that happen 

105.62 106.78 B: i didn't hear about that yet 

107.17 111.48 A: and my son um i said to him i says you know you can't take your nail clippers 

112.21 114.53 A: and your tweezers with you and he said to me 

115.00 117.14 A: i brought them through with me when i came back 

117.84 119.71 A: and i was like no you didn't he says yeah 

120.15 121.38 A: they were in my suitcase 

121.79 122.20 B: yeah 

122.87 123.80 B: well it's (( )) 

124.17 125.04 B: well uh i don't know 

125.28 128.24 A: the other thing too it all depends on when you travel too 

129.05 130.58 A: if you travel late at night 

132.21 133.72 A: there is almost nobody there 

134.38 140.25 A: i would say that the peak hours let us say are monday through friday ma- perhaps between eight and two 

134.48 134.84 B: true 

141.32 147.08 B: uh (( )) i don't know i just don't feel safe we were uh my daughter and i were supposed to uh 

147.37 149.40 B: we were invited to go to egypt 

149.52 150.70 B: with uh you know 

150.88 151.55 B: friends of ours 

152.15 155.23 B: (( )) stay there for a few months and we cancelled 

155.61 156.91 B: (( )) i just don't feel 

157.04 159.75 B: like i want to be in the air at this time 

159.89 162.93 B: especially in the mideast you know just 

163.50 165.82 B: hang out here maybe next year god willing 

166.65 167.58 B: that is about it 

167.31 170.56 A: but it actually it it hasn't deterred me 

170.80 171.52 A: because 

172.13 173.66 A: i guess i have conceded that 

173.78 175.37 A: we are not any safer 

176.19 178.19 A: than we were last year 

178.03 184.73 B: yeah i i guess well you are right in a sense i mean anything could happen i could walk out my door and something could happen 

184.84 189.66 B: but i guess since nine eleven and i was just so closely (( involved )) 

189.68 190.63 A: mhm mhm 

190.45 190.94 B: um 

191.43 193.14 B: i i am just a little bit more leery 

193.29 194.70 B: i i can't explain it i 

194.82 195.38 B: yeah i get 

195.51 206.19 B: the shakes when i hear uh the planes flying over head now as they get lower oh yeah it it affected me because it affected a lot of my family members that were working in manhattan at the time 

199.29 200.05 A: oh really 

204.11 205.52 A: mhm mhm mhm 

206.91 207.77 B: and um 

209.13 213.72 B: i guess that combines with everything else and just all the posturing that bush is doing and 

214.13 216.73 B: uh you know the threat of war and blah blah blah and 

217.41 218.03 B: i i guess 

218.32 219.10 B: i just want to 

219.75 220.19 B: uh 

220.48 222.40 B: i uh i guess it is like a safety 

222.99 223.44 B: uh 

223.54 225.41 B: outlet for me just to stay home 

223.67 225.99 A: yeah if you stay out of the air you feel safer 

226.46 229.31 B: uh it's (( )) it is just that i feel more comfortable in my own home 

229.82 234.13 B: you know like i'll i'll just hang here for a while and see what happens 

232.86 235.38 A: that if you are home y- y- you are safe 

235.10 239.37 B: uh it is not like uh it is an emergency that i have to travel 

239.49 243.21 B: you know it's uh it would be for pleasure only uh it is not for business so 

243.64 246.77 A: (( )) is that um and i was telling somebody 

247.23 250.15 A: and i i really don't think it has anything to do 

250.32 251.22 A: with um 

251.98 253.13 A: terrorism 

254.04 254.31 A: but 

254.48 257.22 A: this the last time my son flew was um 

257.59 258.45 A: the eighteenth 

259.50 260.79 A: the eighth of january 

261.40 263.70 A: and there was a big snowstorm on that morning 

264.06 266.53 A: there was a a plane crash in north carolina 

267.27 272.23 A: and he flew out of here at about two o'clock in the afternoon and that bothered me 

272.41 272.94 B: oh yes 

272.63 274.10 A: but it was weather related 

274.24 274.58 B: yeah 

275.24 276.45 A: as opposed to 

276.83 277.56 B: well that is (( )) 

276.85 277.89 A: that plane 

277.75 280.43 B: yeah that bothers me too when my kids are out and (( )) 

280.04 282.17 A: right being blown away 

280.68 281.71 B: any kind of (( bad weather )) 

282.20 282.50 B: yeah 

282.83 284.99 B: or uh even uh just driving 

285.08 286.25 B: i get uh nervous 

285.26 285.57 A: mhm 

286.35 287.25 B: if i don't hear from them 

287.78 289.48 B: and they are in their thirties you know 

288.31 289.84 A: right right right 

290.26 290.58 B: so 

290.68 292.86 B: my son uh he and his wife 

293.09 293.45 B: just 

293.84 294.42 B: take off 

294.55 297.91 B: at the drop of a hat and um they call me from wherever they are 

296.28 298.84 A: i'm like that too absolutely 

298.56 298.87 B: you know 

299.04 310.85 B: and i feel that is good because if they had told me ahead of time that they were you know just taking off at two o'clock in the morning for parts unknown i would be worried where are they going (( )) so they call me when they get there in the morning oh o._k. good you 

306.47 307.93 A: right right right 

308.19 309.31 A: right right right 

311.23 314.40 A: you are safe there and then you worry when there is an ac- when they are coming back 

315.66 316.35 B: but uh 

316.82 317.70 B: as far as the 

317.81 319.78 B: uh the topic that um 

320.09 321.27 B: was proposed to us 

321.70 323.60 B: no i don't think the heightened security 

324.19 325.77 B: makes a difference in how i feel 

326.29 327.23 B: about uh 

328.08 328.97 B: (( )) that it would 

329.12 329.52 B: uh 

329.67 331.59 B: lighten up on terrorist activities 

331.66 335.04 A: uh i don't think so and and i think the other thing is that 

335.28 336.50 A: they are perhaps 

337.06 338.80 A: if they are planning uh 

339.31 341.02 A: a terrorist attack 

342.13 344.23 A: i think it will not be the airport 

345.90 346.45 B: uh 

345.99 346.84 A: again 

346.61 347.05 B: yeah 

347.43 351.83 A: and it and even if it is i don't think it will be the united states 

352.66 355.25 B: mmm a lot of people feel the same (( )) 

355.38 358.90 B: stay away from the united states (( )) 

358.60 360.51 A: right right right right 

359.79 360.09 B: but 

360.94 362.07 B: you know something i 

362.17 364.81 B: have no idea i i don't think that we are doing 

364.94 366.83 B: such a good job of uh 

367.30 368.82 B: protecting ourselves but 

368.91 370.75 A: yeah but you know what the uh 

371.40 371.72 A: a- 

372.22 374.82 A: aside from from from terrorism 

375.33 381.33 A: i think that the things that we are we are talking about now ought to have been in place a long time ago 

381.84 382.56 B: oh sure 

382.34 384.32 A: because let us say 

384.98 387.37 A: um terrorists aside 

388.50 391.50 A: let us say somebody was just plain old crazy 

392.11 393.86 A: and wanted to hijack an airplane 

394.98 396.37 B: oh yes that is (( )) 

396.09 398.47 A: i mean they could have easily 

399.04 401.70 A: have done it as easy as a terrorist 

402.08 403.62 A: were able to get on 

402.24 402.87 B: oh sure 

403.94 405.55 B: i think they can still do that 

405.53 406.07 A: mhm 

406.28 407.38 B: really if someone is 

407.53 409.69 B: (( )) that is for sure 

409.62 410.64 A: absolutely 

411.17 412.32 B: and uh 

412.43 413.32 B: like you said that was 

413.46 418.35 B: (( )) the uh uh conventional terrorist that you know (( )) 

419.28 420.92 A: what do you um 

421.11 423.41 A: what do you think about um 

424.30 425.69 A: proposals 

427.05 428.61 A: to have armed 

429.90 431.19 A: what did they call them 

430.95 432.92 B: oh the marshals on the plane 

432.44 434.04 A: air air marshals 

434.71 435.33 B: uh 

437.94 438.29 B: if 

438.95 440.82 B: (( )) is very well trained 

440.52 441.23 A: trained 

441.49 442.49 B: then i say yes 

443.14 444.70 B: uh but then again uh 

444.84 445.47 B: you know 

445.69 448.62 B: that that is only as good as the person that is holding the gun 

447.84 448.31 A: right 

448.63 449.02 A: right 

448.73 451.84 B: you know what what is going through their mind at the time 

450.65 454.46 A: well if they say air marshal i i assume that they are going to be like 

454.80 457.64 A: well trained like a marine kind of a 

458.60 459.41 B: yeah but 

459.58 461.33 B: yeah (( )) some of them are nuts too 

462.52 463.03 A: mhm 

467.95 469.27 B: to uh handle a gun 

469.51 470.02 A: mhm 

469.73 476.17 B: has all their marbles (( there )) either you know so uh who knows it is a crap shoot as far as i am concerned 

471.88 473.25 A: mhm mhm mhm 

476.01 476.51 A: mhm 

476.80 477.29 B: you know 

477.55 478.03 B: um 

478.70 481.23 A: and what about um closed cockpits 

482.86 484.24 B: yeah i think they should 

484.29 484.75 A: mhm 

485.30 486.47 A: and i 

485.43 485.75 B: but 

486.66 489.56 A: i guess i i had always assumed that they were locked 

490.73 491.49 B: (( don't )) 

491.71 495.51 A: that that that unless the pilot opened the door for you to get in 

495.96 498.17 A: you couldn't get in but i guess i assumed wrong 

497.43 497.96 B: um 

498.25 503.79 B: yeah no i i i have been on planes where uh we have been invited into the cockpit (( but whether it was locked )) 

504.19 506.23 B: prior to us being invited in 

506.83 509.40 B: i don't know but i just always assumed that 

509.96 510.71 B: you know it was open 

510.91 511.43 A: hm 

511.09 511.49 B: (( )) 

512.22 512.99 B: you know uh 

513.99 517.94 A: but the other thing too uh and and i even 

518.06 523.33 A: i had a conversation with a friend of mine that i consider that terrorism too pilots who are drunk 

524.25 524.90 B: oh sure 

525.58 526.44 B: (( )) but 

526.71 530.93 B: again that that happens also like i said if a person is determined 

531.53 532.24 B: to do something 

532.49 533.82 B: they will find a way 

535.08 535.71 B: to do it 

535.57 536.24 A: (( )) 

536.27 542.84 B: and uh as far as the terrorists they w- first of all we we tip our hands no matter what we are doing we tell everybody 

542.86 543.36 A: mhm 

543.28 547.09 B: so they are already aware of of what precautions we put into place 

545.29 550.44 A: oh what we are ta- we put into place and and are working around that if they are planning
