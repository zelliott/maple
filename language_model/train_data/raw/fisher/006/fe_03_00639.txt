24.76 27.76 A: uh-huh well i'm in delaware i did live in maine 

28.05 30.78 A: the changes that we made were um 

31.34 40.39 A: [mn] well initially we had decided to not to move we were all set had gotten our house on the market ready to sell we had decided not to move 

40.52 46.71 A: uh concerned about being too close to d._c. but we did end up moving what kind of things did you uh did you do 

43.26 43.96 B: right 

46.61 50.13 B: uh basically we didn't take a trip that that year 

50.47 54.22 B: and since then we haven't i've flown once but the family hasn't flown 

54.64 55.53 B: (( 'cause )) 

54.87 56.55 A: you haven't flown 

56.23 57.03 B: no 

56.80 58.28 A: yeah that's a big one 

57.13 64.83 B: well i have but my my uh family meaning my wife and my kids haven't flown because my wife's petrified of the skies [laughter] but uh 

60.44 61.29 A: right 

64.41 66.00 A: was she before that 

65.66 67.90 B: uh yes she was but then this 

68.25 70.59 B: the whole thing that went on just you know 

71.03 73.44 B: made it even worse than it was you know [laughter] 

72.47 80.13 A: sure yeah absolutely now i had i had the same fears i never cared for flying but i wouldn't do it after that 

73.52 74.25 B: so 

74.54 75.37 B: right 

79.63 80.78 B: right 

80.17 82.69 A: so i guess in that respect it changed as well 

82.63 85.52 B: yeah actually i just thought of it as you know 

86.16 94.86 B: if if it was gonna happen it was gonna happen but the odds of it happened happening are very slim compared to other things that could happen to you 

94.92 95.72 B: so 

95.38 96.69 A: (( [mn] uh that's how )) 

96.01 98.20 B: that's the way i look at life you know 

97.79 98.80 A: uh-huh 

98.84 100.98 B: even before and after you know 

101.42 103.30 A: i guess that's uh a good thing 

102.70 103.68 B: yeah 

103.37 107.94 A: i think i'm not sure [laughter] [noise] after i mean 

108.26 110.91 A: i understand and do look at it like if you're 

111.01 114.94 A: if you're destined to go you're going to but i certainly try to avoid what i can 

112.47 113.43 B: right 

114.60 117.37 B: right definitely you have more more than one option on 

114.95 115.89 A: [noise] 

117.41 118.90 B: that part 

118.48 121.20 A: [mn] so have you has it changed any other traveling 

120.98 123.37 B: uh other than that 

123.54 128.47 B: no not trav- otherwise you know taking vacations and that we'll just do day trips 

128.48 134.01 B: but other than that we plan on going to florida next year but we haven't made up a decision which way we're gonna go 

133.55 136.58 A: [noise] yeah so you travel by a different means you mean 

135.89 139.28 B: yeah exactly the c- car or take the train or 

139.92 147.66 B: if i can get 'em to fly i would fly again but it's their final decision if they don't want to fly then [laughter] we won't fly 

147.93 150.89 B: but other than that changes for me 

151.27 153.34 B: uh i couldn't say 

154.60 155.97 B: not too much you know 

155.98 157.47 B: other than that you know 

157.71 163.65 A: i think for me i paid more attention to the news and the politics i have c._n._n. running almost all the time [mn] 

163.31 169.68 B: yeah yeah it usually catches your ear when you hear what's going on in the other parts of the country that or even in the world 

169.64 170.55 A: right 

170.45 171.21 B: (( you know )) 

171.45 173.66 B: because it does reflect what's gonna happen here 

171.65 172.70 A: yeah 

173.76 180.14 A: were you so you said you were in massachusetts were you um at home or near there when it happened 

179.52 185.51 B: actually yes i was i was at home and i did watch it live on t._v. happen 

185.39 186.37 A: wow 

186.00 189.64 B: i mean as you know as as it was happening at the time 

189.04 189.93 A: right 

189.67 191.10 B: but i just uh 

191.27 194.10 B: actually i just was logged onto the internet and then uh 

193.76 194.69 A: mhm 

194.30 197.38 B: i seen it was on my headlines on the yahoo 

198.09 202.45 B: and right then and there i flipped on the t._v. and then i seen the second one come in 

202.29 203.11 A: hm 

202.76 203.53 B: so 

203.59 210.16 A: you know that was another change actually that we made as well um we didn't own a t._v. we wouldn't own one we thought it was bad influence 

210.21 214.66 A: on our um on our kids and after that we got one [laughter] 

214.32 215.53 B: (( right yeah )) 

214.92 226.26 A: so that we would be able to keep updated and [mn] because it was really scary not knowing what was going on but knowing something was we kept getting phone calls [laughter] people telling us and i wanted to see it you know so i had to go to a friend's house to watch it 

225.66 230.14 B: oh actually see it yeah uh changes for my kids they're 

230.44 231.35 B: more 

231.97 234.18 B: you know alert to what's going on [laughter] you know 

233.53 234.59 A: (( they are )) 

234.27 235.80 B: they you know 

235.86 241.35 B: i'm sure it's always in the back of their mind so i'm sure you know some people don't talk about it but it does 

241.48 244.07 B: still affect everybody i believe 

243.65 246.79 A: yeah did you have any family that are military 

246.85 250.72 B: uh no no active family in the military right now 

250.47 251.90 A: then that was good 

251.12 254.07 B: so it hasn't you know changed for them 

253.28 255.92 A: yeah well we did we had um 

256.42 261.12 A: my husband's cousin was he's a captain in the navy i think 

261.19 268.24 A: and then we had some other members who were reserves but actually his sister did get called up she was uh secretarial so she wasn't in combat or any 

268.41 270.94 A: you know threatening things she ended up going down to d._c. 

271.52 272.79 A: and then um 

274.14 278.17 A: we don't know where his all we knew is he he got shipped out his cousin 

278.31 279.23 B: right 

278.64 280.74 A: we couldn't know where to or anything 

280.59 282.92 B: right so they're out of the country now right 

282.61 284.30 A: i don't know [mn] 

283.65 288.15 B: oh oh oh you don't know they don't tell you where they're going [laughter] that's true yeah 

286.70 288.28 A: (( no uh-uh )) 

288.25 289.12 B: right 

288.53 295.68 A: not in his his part anyway for whatever reason they don't so we just keep in touch apparently his wife's not supposed to even know i guess 

295.36 296.60 B: right 

296.48 298.85 A: [mn] but they email and all that 

298.30 299.70 B: (( exactly right )) 

299.32 308.45 A: so but they they weren't anyone that i was exceptionally close with so i don't know too much about their changes [mn] but for us there there's been a lot there really has even though some of them are 

308.99 312.33 A: undercurrents you know like paying more attention to all the news stuff and everything 

311.19 318.21 B: exactly that's that's the way yeah but you know i didn't do any more drastic changes other than that you know 

318.03 320.24 A: did you have any family members out near 

320.46 321.97 A: closer to it than you were 

322.51 323.69 B: to boston 

323.65 325.69 A: yeah closer to um 

326.13 327.49 A: the nine eleven 

328.55 329.61 A: incident 

330.01 331.93 B: n- not that i know of 

331.86 333.85 A: so nobody you were the closest 

333.81 341.48 B: yeah um well we've got relatives that live closer to b- boston we're about fifty miles outside of boston but uh 

342.37 344.06 B: now now i get my uh 

344.27 345.81 B: my uh in law 

346.15 350.13 B: my wife's uh brother works for the aviation department down in 

350.97 353.76 B: down in uh boston logan where it's secure 

352.92 353.84 A: mhm 

354.15 356.03 B: he does uh inspection 

356.20 362.95 B: he got hired after the nine eleven you know months after probably he's been there about three months now 

364.02 367.48 B: so yeah that's actually a change that you could say happened 

365.51 366.08 A: (( [noise] )) 

367.46 371.04 A: mhm well it happened in an indirect way to you 

370.45 374.43 B: right exactly yeah so now he works he works in inspection down there 

374.75 375.54 A: hm 

375.00 378.76 B: he put in for the federal jobs when they put out all the jobs 

379.08 380.11 B: at uh 

380.88 383.25 B: what do they call it homeland security 

383.00 384.19 A: oh okay 

383.69 392.83 B: yeah that he put in for one of those positions and he got that so that now that i think about it it did affect me a little bit different [laughter] i got somebody that's working in the uh 

386.73 387.93 A: terrific 

389.79 390.77 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

393.41 394.68 B: down at logan 

395.38 401.18 B: but uh other than that i can't really think of anything that oh yeah well actually my daughter's 

401.36 407.68 B: trip that was gonna take place in washington d._c. which uh they do every year for the eighth grade students 

403.95 405.14 A: mhm 

407.49 409.06 A: for okay right 

408.43 412.64 B: they go they go away every year she was she was this year she's an eighth grader 

412.45 413.43 A: uh-huh 

413.00 421.44 B: but last year she was a seventh grader and the eighth graders didn't go and again this year they decided not to send them down to washington d._c. for the week 

421.48 422.63 A: you're kidding 

421.75 425.45 B: so it's still affecting them the school committee you know 

424.75 425.80 A: wow 

425.95 428.19 A: gosh we've been down to d._c. 

426.17 426.93 B: (( what's )) 

427.19 427.98 B: that 

428.61 430.88 A: we've been down twice since 

430.46 431.52 B: yeah 

430.90 432.78 A: it's okay getting on [laughter] 

431.64 440.31 B: but the school committee made a decision not to send them for the second year so i don't know how many years in effect this is gonna be you know that's gonna take before they 

440.47 442.41 B: figure it's safe you know right 

441.79 442.86 A: mhm 

443.16 444.52 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

444.68 449.52 A: what about keeping in contact with your family members has it changed for that have you been more diligent 

448.53 451.09 B: yeah yeah i you know i 

451.37 454.47 B: check in a little bit more often than usual you know 

454.16 455.15 A: mhm 

455.42 457.65 B: and the family check in with us 

455.61 456.54 A: i have 

457.73 458.71 A: they do 

458.36 459.54 B: yeah 

459.39 463.44 A: well at the time we were living in maine and my mother was on long island she still is 

463.32 464.48 B: right 

463.87 467.64 A: but um and so that seemed really close even though it's not 

467.86 480.41 A: you know necessarily right on top of it or whatever it was closer than maine [laughter] we seemed much more removed so and for me i i've changed in that i pay more attention to i give her a call a lot more often i really was i laxed in that 

470.98 472.25 B: exactly yeah 

481.39 485.86 B: right i notice myself being more aware you know of everything going around me now 

481.42 482.45 A: (( so you know )) 

485.49 486.57 A: mhm 

486.71 494.33 B: and you know i watch people what they do more [laughter] if you if you would say that you know be more observant of what's going on 

493.07 494.08 A: mhm 

494.31 495.24 A: okay 

494.65 498.16 B: well you don't you don't you don't worry about what people are doing i think i 

498.21 499.81 B: i watch people more 

499.53 500.41 A: mhm 

500.27 502.33 B: and if they don't look you know 

502.40 503.16 B: (( they're )) 

503.25 506.96 B: doing something they [laughter] should do you know i'll even watch even closer 

506.71 514.62 A: mhm so do you find and and i'll just be blunt do you find that you [mn] lean towards watching people who are of a muslim uh ethnicity more 

514.25 516.60 B: yeah not being biased but i think 

517.19 518.18 B: you know that's 

518.37 521.06 B: more what i'm looking at [laughter] you know 

519.52 520.56 A: yeah 

521.79 524.43 A: i i think i do too you know 

523.62 524.67 B: (( but you know )) 

525.12 526.44 B: it's hard you know 

527.24 533.36 B: that's that's the you know if it happens being someone someone else or another nationality or whatever 

533.72 536.09 B: i'd probably do the same thing to them 

535.84 536.79 A: right 

536.56 537.67 B: like you know 

538.07 540.52 B: like if you know someone says you know this 

538.38 539.25 A: (( yeah )) 

540.94 545.65 B: type of person's gonna attempt this thing you're gonna look at that person you know 

545.81 552.01 B: you might not do it you know purposely but you're still gonna look at that person differently than you would before 

552.20 553.14 A: right 

552.23 557.32 B: i think everybody does it even if they tell you they don't look at them differently you know they do 

557.30 558.22 A: hm 

557.90 566.73 B: i think i think even the between themselves they probably look at each other differently subconsciously is what i'm saying it's you know so far 

563.66 565.61 A: mhm mhm 

567.32 571.35 B: if they don't i think they're lying to ya [laughter] yeah 

569.44 570.55 A: yeah 

570.74 574.40 A: did you consider yourself um in general did you consider yourself 

574.62 580.22 A: somebody who would lean toward being prejudiced or not before that happened towards that ethnic group 

580.55 583.59 B: uh probably not probably not you 

582.02 582.81 A: no 

582.99 583.81 A: mhm 

584.17 588.71 B: know because my wife works with doctors that are like muslims and that 

588.13 589.03 A: mhm 

588.93 595.05 B: and and i probably wouldn't but after that you know i would think twice you know [laughter] 

592.29 593.05 A: hm 

595.28 599.89 A: i was i really was i watched a show when i was young called not without my daughter and
