8.23 8.92 B: this is 

10.92 12.78 A: i guess my favorite one would be christmas 

12.90 13.60 B: yes me too 

13.24 16.40 A: and that yeah because it's it's um 

16.75 22.50 A: it's got a special meaning as a holiday we've commercialized it a lot but it is also a time for family and 

22.83 23.98 A: friends to get together 

24.25 24.62 A: so 

25.62 30.69 B: yup mine would be christmas too my favorite suggestion would be um my mom has a big christmas village 

31.29 31.69 B: and 

31.41 31.82 A: oh 

31.82 34.82 B: and an old-fashioned tree and so one day we spend 

35.00 37.64 B: putting the tree up and then the next day we spend doing all the village 

38.48 39.62 A: oh that sounds neat 

38.64 39.54 B: underneath the tree 

39.85 44.00 B: it is a lot of fun and and the best thing about christmas too is the birth of christ 

44.57 45.32 A: oh you bet 

45.37 45.87 B: you know 

45.47 46.19 A: that is the 

46.40 48.12 A: that is the number one reason

54.16 54.46 A: it is 

55.65 56.41 A: um 

56.60 57.49 A: no i think we 

57.65 60.39 A: pretty much agree on that 

58.54 59.81 B: okay 

60.57 61.90 A: and then the other question was

158.19 158.87 A: move on 

158.75 161.00 B: i have no idea i thought we were supposed to talk for ten minutes 

161.80 164.21 A: oh is that was it said i didn't hear it 

162.70 165.71 B: i don't well when i signed up that is what i thought it said 

167.02 167.28 B: so 

167.23 169.95 A: okay you are probably right i kind of reread it as i was 

170.62 172.25 A: waiting for your call to come through 

172.26 172.74 B: uh-huh 

173.16 173.74 A: so i didn't 

173.92 175.32 A: read that part about ten minutes 

175.23 176.30 B: yeah i don't know 

177.49 179.51 B: maybe we could just hang up i don't know 

179.78 181.54 A: yeah or we could talk about your 

181.87 182.69 A: your kids or 

183.19 184.81 A: or our kids 

184.64 186.73 B: yeah i don't want to say too much though because 

186.83 189.90 B: they are recording it and i don't know who they are 

189.19 190.00 A: that is true 

190.12 190.81 A: that is true 

190.73 191.39 B: you know 

191.17 193.96 A: probably could think if we have anything else to say about holidays 

194.09 195.13 B: okay holidays 

195.66 200.59 A: oh like one thing i can say is that we did it a long time ago and we kind of start 

200.83 202.08 A: started to do it again it's 

202.39 203.94 A: trying to think about the people 

204.37 204.82 A: um 

204.92 208.64 A: who don't have family or anyone visiting them like in the nursing homes 

209.40 215.91 A: um so we used to my husband would take his (( )) we would go and visit some of the people in the nursing homes and not just at christmas 

216.01 218.17 A: either but christmas is a time for 

218.71 220.30 A: you know they get forgotten 

220.56 220.94 B: uh-huh 

221.38 226.66 A: and they don't have families some of them and just go into their rooms and they love the kids too 

227.75 229.66 A: so that is just one thing we've done over 

229.96 230.60 A: the holidays 

230.62 232.07 B: would that be one of your favorite traditions 

233.02 237.20 A: yeah i suppose it is just the busyness we kind of got out of it but we did do it 

237.32 238.30 A: this past christmas 

240.93 242.99 B: i was trying to think of my favorite tradition 

243.66 244.73 B: for that besides the 

244.85 245.38 B: tree 

245.54 247.66 B: i don't know though -cause we are just starting 

247.68 248.35 A: yeah 

248.19 250.77 B: we we don't really have a lot of traditions for ourself yet 

251.24 251.76 A: yeah 

251.72 254.29 B: um -cause the kids are really just starting to get into it 

254.92 255.33 A: yeah 

256.57 258.86 A: so do they know about santa claus and or 

258.43 259.76 B: no no santa 

260.13 261.43 A: yeah we didn't do it either 

261.53 262.36 B: no i just 

262.54 263.98 B: yeah we didn't like that idea 

264.33 264.73 A: uh ah 

264.93 266.43 A: -cause it is not santa that gives them the 

266.64 267.04 A: presents 

267.25 268.33 B: right right 

268.25 270.51 A: some people think that they miss out on christmas 

271.24 272.01 A: you know if they don't 

272.47 275.98 A: have santa but we like our daughters to (( )) now 

276.42 277.68 A: she is our youngest and 

277.80 278.93 A: she always 

279.22 283.28 A: knew of santa and she could sit on his lap and all that but he was like 

283.43 285.82 A: he was like uh the easter bunny or 

286.10 287.42 A: just some cute little 

288.21 296.94 A: like porky the pig or daffy duck you know some animated character but not the one that brings gifts or not the reason we celebrate christmas either 

292.29 293.04 B: you are right right 

296.53 297.07 B: right 

299.53 299.87 A: so 

301.18 302.27 A: i guess maybe we 

303.02 307.32 A: after our time is up they will just disconnect us or that operation person will come back on 

307.51 308.29 B: i have no idea 

309.13 310.66 B: did you you didn't talk to someone though 

311.67 314.99 A: i i only talked to um i think it was the recorders operator 

314.67 315.54 B: okay yeah yeah 

315.14 315.70 A: sort of thing 

316.31 316.96 A: is that what you did

377.95 379.28 A: i don't know what we should do 

379.53 381.62 A: i mean i guess that is a good question we should 

382.02 384.89 A: there is a phone number that you can call if you have any questions 

384.94 385.37 B: yeah
