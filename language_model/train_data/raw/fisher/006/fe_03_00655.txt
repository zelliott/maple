38.57 43.47 B: maybe two or three blocks down but i was here i was away at school when it happened 

44.22 49.79 B: and um it was so strange that when i found how i found out about it because i was um 

50.73 53.26 B: working out in my dorm room and 

53.73 55.65 B: i was trying to find a video 

56.47 59.97 B: to do one of my presentations on it and the maker of the video gave me a call

95.25 96.52 B: um from brooklyn 

96.73 100.59 B: from there to brooklyn she has never been back to work since because she was a much a older woman 

100.94 102.47 B: but i can't say that um 

103.31 105.70 B: my life has changed because there's really n- 

106.13 106.88 B: nothing

116.31 117.93 B: you know and i think 

118.75 122.53 B: this all getting back and forth over the years has caused this to 

123.24 126.58 B: come to where it and i and i have to say this if 

127.45 128.10 B: um 

129.06 131.60 B: if united states if america wasn't so cocky 

132.13 136.55 B: we wouldn't be y- i don't think it would ever happen because this is the same country that taught
