51.04 52.32 A: i know i do 

52.37 54.63 A: um but uh 

54.84 59.09 A: i don't think that's the topic we're supposed to be talking about [laughter] 

57.09 57.81 B: no 

58.51 59.76 B: [laughter] 

59.79 62.36 A: [laughter] it just threw me off when i saw that 

62.44 66.84 A: um you know that's the nice thing about having a cell phone or cordless phone is you can go 

67.09 68.13 B: mhm 

67.25 69.75 A: (( all over the place but anyway )) 

72.11 73.50 A: (( i don't know i mean )) 

73.65 78.90 A: (( i was going to say about the last time i flew is some weeks ago and i had a clip in my hair )) 

79.07 81.49 A: you know like a big metal barrette 

81.31 82.41 B: yeah 

81.75 85.17 A: and i got stopped and i got wanded 

85.53 91.85 A: and you know the guy make me take the barrette off and he wanded me again and everything and i thought but that happened before 

92.15 93.56 A: nine eleven too 

94.17 97.98 A: you know because whenever i wore something big like that in my hair they would always 

98.26 101.07 A: stop and make me take it off if i forgot to take it off 

100.94 101.99 B: right 

101.79 103.70 A: you know and put it in the tray so i mean 

104.68 106.65 A: (( you know that stuff has been going on )) 

107.00 110.05 A: but you know nobody's checked my shoes nobody's 

110.44 114.23 A: really checked too much of anything and you know they tell you don't bring uh 

114.89 116.52 A: flammable stuff on 

117.15 124.08 A: and i realized they went through the whole of the trip last time with a little spray can of stain remover in my pocket which i forgot was there 

124.21 128.39 B: which you could have yeah you could have it could have been used for a weapon 

126.28 127.62 A: which could explode 

128.28 129.64 A: yeah exactly 

129.82 134.09 A: you know and of course if i'd known it was there i would have taken it out because i took out my swiss army knife 

134.19 135.09 B: mhm 

134.88 137.24 A: you know but nobody searched my bag 

138.01 138.79 A: so 

139.68 140.72 B: so is it 

140.73 142.81 B: so i don't really think it's helping 

143.32 144.67 A: i think if 

145.78 148.22 B: i think they're profiling people 

148.16 150.27 A: yeah i think they're doing that 

148.71 150.33 B: which doesn't help 

150.66 153.10 B: i mean anybody could be a terrorist 

150.81 152.20 A: yeah 

152.99 157.27 A: yeah i absolutely agree with you and i think terrorists are not stupid 

157.76 162.13 A: you know they may not be nice people but they're also smart a lot of them and you know 

163.40 166.16 A: what if they got some old grandmother 

166.69 169.41 A: you know i mean even if she was a pakistani grandmother 

169.35 170.25 B: mhm 

170.09 171.60 A: you know to to 

172.18 175.55 A: become a suicide bomber it's you know it's uh 

175.77 179.43 A: chances are good that she wouldn't get stopped although on the other hand they did uh 

180.50 184.81 A: or my mother went through the airport in a wheelchair they searched her pretty good one time so 

184.91 187.13 A: (( who's to say [laughter] )) 

185.02 186.04 B: really 

186.12 186.68 B: (( [mn] )) 

187.58 188.23 A: (( right )) 

187.95 189.07 B: well i'm 

188.27 189.18 A: you know 

189.19 192.76 B: flying again on february twenty eighth so 

193.38 196.15 B: i'll see but frankly i don't think 

198.05 203.15 B: from what i've seen and what i've heard from people and from yourself i don't think that 

203.95 209.13 B: i don't think they can really do anything about it i think if people want to get it on there they can get it on 

209.71 214.50 A: it was funny because i was just talking to somebody about this um just before i came home tonight 

214.57 221.79 A: and he said you know there's really this guy's an old retired guy somebody i know 

221.80 225.04 A: and he said he was working in the airline industry pretty much all his life 

225.21 228.62 A: and he said the same thing you know if they want to get it on even now they will 

228.63 229.50 B: (( uh hum )) 

229.21 236.17 A: but the thing is what he said and i kind of agree with him is where they'll stop it will be before they ever get near the plane 

236.79 237.99 A: you know that if 

239.50 241.73 A: the f._b._i. or whatever is 

241.76 244.88 A: trying to locate these people who have these intentions 

245.54 249.55 A: and stop them before it gets to the point where you know you have to search 

250.06 250.90 B: yeah 

251.15 252.27 A: (( them you know )) 

252.14 261.40 B: yeah well i think see i don't know i'm kinda i'm one of those people that's a little paranoid and thinks that the government has access to everything we do 

261.29 262.72 A: yeah yeah 

261.92 266.92 B: and then but then on the other hand that's kind of unreasonable to really think that they're that bright 

267.44 269.29 B: i mean they're just people 

269.37 278.54 B: and i you know that like i said there's part of me that thinks they have access so when these people are checking out books on how to make bombs and stuff i know 

278.62 282.32 B: if they check them out of a library or they buy 'em from a bookstore 

283.73 286.22 B: certain things red light 

286.29 288.01 B: there you know what i mean 

288.04 292.93 B: like buying books on bombs and stuff but i don't really know how accurate that is 

288.44 289.39 A: (( [mn] )) 

293.13 294.94 A: well i yeah 

294.77 296.97 B: you know what i mean i don't really know 

297.14 299.70 B: what kind of a handle they have on this 

300.44 306.15 A: well i i think that some of it is you know old fashioned just leg work 

306.23 307.13 B: mhm 

306.36 309.24 A: you know like old fashioned police work i don't think that 

309.68 314.22 A: you know and i am a librarian and i really don't like the idea of them being able to you know 

314.48 320.39 A: because what if i check out a book on making bombs just so i can find out what to look for the next time i'm on a plane 

318.69 319.69 B: mhm 

320.69 323.42 A: you know does that make me a terrorist i'm not a terrorist 

323.07 324.03 B: no 

323.94 327.01 A: you know but the thing of it is 

328.96 329.92 A: you know 

329.95 331.71 A: on the other hand if you 

332.03 342.50 A: have informants you know or have your sources and you're an f._b._i. agent and you know your one source comes to you and says hey you know that guy mohammed has just moved down the street from me and he's you know 

342.77 354.48 A: he's into all this stuff and he's going to this mosque and he's you know yelled at my wife the other day and said you know she should be in the house and you know america's such a horrible place and everything well you know maybe that guy bears a little bit more checking out 

354.49 355.74 B: mhm 

355.32 362.32 A: you know or maybe the guy down the street who's saying the same thing only his name is john smith and who he's he has some kind of white survivalist guy 

362.48 363.86 B: exactly 

363.57 366.04 A: you know 'cause they're equally both terrorists 

365.82 367.23 B: mhm 

366.98 372.99 A: you know and i think that's the way a lot of these things get solved is through police work rather than through uh 

374.75 377.65 A: [sigh] searching and 

377.22 379.82 B: and all the high tech surveillance and all that 

379.52 382.00 A: yeah and you know randomly 

382.03 383.62 A: going after people 

383.54 384.50 B: yeah 

383.83 385.92 A: you know i think that 

386.41 393.36 A: yeah that's not to say that stuff doesn't have a place 'cause as much as i hate it and i fear it i think it probably does have a place 

393.44 394.66 B: yeah me too 

394.59 395.49 A: (( you know )) 

395.30 398.98 B: i mean i'm afraid of it and i wish that it didn't have to be there but 

398.99 405.93 B: i think a lot of it you know i don't like them watching us i grew up in fear once i saw nineteen eighty four 

405.77 406.74 A: mhm 

406.25 412.43 B: i grew up in fear of that and now it's here and it's like okay but it's kinda necessary 

412.98 418.47 B: some of it you know i mean i got used to having cameras at the workplace 

418.71 419.91 A: (( yes )) 

419.27 423.59 B: and they were all over and my thing was well i'm not doing anything wrong 

424.16 426.73 B: so who cares and i got to where i ignored them 

427.03 427.91 A: yeah 

428.09 430.16 B: but at the same time 

430.44 432.75 B: i don't really like them being there 

432.88 439.23 A: i don't like the presumption that you're guilty until proven innocent you know and that's what it says to me cameras in the workplace 

437.80 438.75 B: mhm 

439.32 441.69 A: i don't know what what they were there for 

441.45 443.55 B: well it was in a grocery store 

443.79 448.05 A: so it was partly there for your protection it was partly there to prevent theft 

447.38 449.55 B: oh yeah definitely 

449.96 457.76 B: and we still had people that we had one girl i mean the cameras were trained right on the check stands and she was pocketing twenty dollar bills 

458.16 460.02 B: you know they're there 

459.93 462.43 A: (( yeah [mn] yeah )) 

460.58 462.88 B: you know i mean how stupid are you 

463.02 467.09 A: well i absolutely someone i know once said crime makes you stupid 

468.17 469.31 B: said what 

469.01 470.88 A: crime makes you stupid 

470.77 471.68 B: yeah 

471.66 473.56 A: you know i mean it's a true 

473.96 478.26 A: you know if you're smart you can find other ways to get ahead besides being a criminal 

477.96 479.13 B: that's right 

479.40 480.64 A: but um 

480.34 491.04 B: i've known a lot of bright criminals and it's just like you know if you just knocked your crap off and put as much effort into something legitimate you'd have money instead of being in jail [laughter] 

483.12 484.03 A: well 

491.35 498.98 A: that's true that's true i mean there and as i said the bright ones are the ones that don't usually get caught but then there's also like a subset of people that are just lazy 

499.10 500.06 B: (( that s true )) 

499.54 500.33 A: (( you )) 

502.20 504.43 A: (( know that's the thing it's )) 

505.14 507.91 A: (( a quick fix solution and you know to get it back to the )) 

508.02 511.26 A: suicide bombers that's what they're trying to go for 

512.03 520.78 A: you know if you think about it it's like well we're not wanting to sit down and dialogue with you people because you know we hate you and we think you're the infidels and you know you should all die right now 

520.72 521.63 B: (( mhm )) 

521.29 524.80 A: so we're going to kill you and you know we'll blow up with you because 

525.21 527.96 A: we're seventeen years old and we just don't care 

528.18 532.37 B: exac- well they have nothing to care about because they haven't been taught any different 

532.49 537.01 A: right and they don't have you know any jobs or any prospects of the future or any kind of 

537.39 541.97 A: you know reason to think that things can be solved peacefully they don't have an example set for them ever 

541.88 545.41 B: and it's and they they're taught to believe it's all our fault 

545.23 546.63 A: (( yes of course they are )) 

545.59 551.60 B: its' not their government it's not that they're all being held bound that the women aren't being given any education that 

552.03 556.44 B: they don't want to come into the twenty first century twenty second century whatever it is 

556.84 558.86 A: (( its twenty first century i think )) 

558.01 561.28 B: [laughter] it is the twenty first okay they don't want to come in 

559.58 563.69 A: yes i think twenty first century is us and twenty second century start from 

564.06 564.87 B: okay 

564.88 569.46 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

565.52 566.67 B: [laughter] 

567.13 575.67 B: i mean they don't they don't want to come in to the new century they don't want to look at anything they want to stay stuck in a bunch of old values 

575.86 577.36 B: that just 

578.15 579.76 B: don't apply any more 

579.79 581.05 A: well you 

580.05 584.81 B: and and they don't work if they worked they would have something 

582.30 583.53 A: (( know but )) 

584.97 586.46 A: (( the thing is it's )) 

587.26 588.82 A: like any other 

591.40 595.26 A: i hate to use the word patriarchal system because it's not exactly what i mean but 

595.79 597.45 A: any other [sigh] 

598.12 599.89 A: kind of system where you get people
