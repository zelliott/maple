28.33 29.16 A: safety 

29.26 31.06 B: yes 

30.05 36.58 A: well that seems pretty pretty self evident so i would agree with that as a sweep sweeping generalization 

32.51 33.14 B: yeah 

33.95 34.36 B: yeah 

37.00 38.38 B: and i said yes also 

40.22 42.32 B: i wonder how long we have to discuss this 

46.34 48.23 A: who's suppose to take charge 

47.97 51.95 B: i have no idea 

51.97 53.35 A: oh okay well 

53.61 55.51 B: i guess we maybe if we're just uh 

56.41 57.77 B: then move onto the next question 

58.33 59.50 A: move onto the next question 

59.42 60.20 B: yeah 

59.93 61.06 A: is their another question 

62.02 62.74 B: i don't know 

66.86 68.09 A: well there has to be some 

70.04 71.99 A: hopefully there some direction here 

71.60 72.65 B: i would hope so 

75.33 78.91 A: or maybe we were suppose to be matched up to disagree 

79.75 80.34 B: i don't know 

81.69 85.74 B: how can you talk how can you discuss a question like that it's such a generalization 

86.90 87.96 A: yes it is just 

88.17 90.08 A: to general i mean 

97.22 99.22 B: you think we're going to get something else here 

99.67 100.85 A: i have no idea 

102.61 103.25 A: i mean i've got 

104.44 105.64 A: potentially lots of 

106.95 109.97 A: political opinions but i would need like a bit of a direction 

112.16 113.51 B: hm 

114.71 115.76 B: no idea 

118.57 119.46 B: i would imagine it's 

119.02 120.84 A: do you hear circus music in the back ground 

120.61 122.24 B: that's that's i'm cleaning up (( )) 

122.69 123.29 A: oh okay 

123.88 124.66 A: ah yes 

126.11 127.72 A: i mean i don't even like 

127.90 130.13 A: it's been years since i've rode an airplane 

131.36 132.07 B: oh i've been 

132.28 133.92 B: and you know i haven't really been on one since 

134.11 135.72 B: nine eleven now that you mention it 

136.94 139.15 A: it's been yeah years before that yes 

140.19 142.74 A: i've heard about people who've like take their shoes off 

142.96 143.50 B: mhm 

143.68 144.69 A: and everyone feels 

145.73 151.57 A: um relatively put out and yet they also feel uncomfortable with you know slightly guilty with feeling put out 

153.16 155.51 B: i think it's it's all about the time factor 

155.92 160.41 B: it's all the complaints i hear about how early you have to get there how long the lines are 

163.74 165.45 B: gosh you think we get anything else here 

166.58 169.47 A: i have no idea this is the first um call i've 

169.66 170.58 B: yeah me too 

169.93 171.44 A: that that i've accepted 

172.22 172.70 B: me too 

172.27 175.22 A: i mean i was under the impression it was ten minutes so i suppose we 

175.29 180.24 B: so where do you live 

175.50 177.32 A: gab along and they get 

177.42 178.50 A: their moneys worth 

181.93 183.33 B: oh geez 

184.38 187.73 B: i just assumed it would be a series of questions with prompts 

189.08 193.29 A: well that would be eh eh that would be an assumption i would share 

193.19 193.73 B: mhm 

194.44 195.18 A: um 

198.80 203.16 A: at the shame time it's something about conveying information so supposedly they're 

204.77 205.17 B: right 

204.88 210.40 A: this this process of us just free falling and feeling like we need to fill up the space must be 

210.70 211.11 A: what 

211.34 212.61 A: what the study is after 

212.65 213.17 B: mhm 

216.55 218.16 B: so is the question really about 

218.42 219.64 B: airport security 

223.08 223.93 A: pretext 

224.06 226.20 A: about it's about throwing people who have 

226.28 232.06 A: who don't know each other um at one another and and seeing what gets stated 

232.51 233.22 A: i would guess 

233.60 234.08 A: but 

234.09 234.84 B: interesting 

238.46 239.53 B: so 

239.81 241.78 A: i suspected this would be like some sort of 

242.72 243.98 A: psych out 

245.87 247.82 B: oh 

248.02 250.03 B: so how long you think we give it 

251.30 255.14 A: i would say just a couple of minutes and then we hang up and who knows what they'll 

254.70 255.85 B: i guess so 

256.38 257.14 A: uh 

259.60 259.98 B: huh 

262.38 263.16 B: that's really funny 

265.60 266.99 A: so you answered yes too 

267.21 267.51 B: yeah 

268.38 275.44 A: right well obviously no one likes the idea on being on airplanes that go smashing into buildings 

272.61 273.27 B: no 

278.38 286.27 A: well if anyone's tape recording this i just want to say that just rounding up people and taking them off to the side i'm definitely against that 

286.42 290.21 B: well i'm also i think we're looking for nail clippers instead of terrorists 

293.30 295.25 A: nail clippers instead of terrorists 

294.94 295.48 B: mhm 

296.62 299.12 B: i think we're looking for weapons instead of terrorists 

302.81 303.93 A: uh if you care to 

304.10 305.26 A: elaborate on that 

305.53 309.23 B: well i think they i i think a certain amount of profiling is necessary 

309.67 310.19 A: oh you do 

310.29 310.84 B: mhm 

312.73 315.43 B: because i think we should be looking for terrorists rather then weapons 

317.03 317.45 A: oh 

318.00 318.59 A: well i guess i would 

318.72 327.05 A: pretty well disagree with that i think like the whole nine eleven phenomena was was pretty well was pretty well a mind game in that an international 

327.80 329.42 A: consortium of terrorists 

330.03 335.90 A: put together an operation then carefully selected people from one particular 

336.21 336.90 A: country 

338.01 341.10 A: as an aim for creating discord between those two countries 

341.08 341.61 B: mhm 

341.68 343.14 A: and i think it allows 

343.47 345.13 A: out own 

345.52 346.94 A: prejudices 

347.71 352.68 A: i think was part of the plan i think i mean anyone who knows anything about bin laden knows that his 

353.17 361.47 A: his chore issue is is u._s. troops in saudi arabia in the government in saudi arabia so he picked saudis 

358.37 358.93 B: mhm 

360.46 360.86 B: picked 

362.19 363.16 A: for the particular 

363.53 364.09 B: mhm 

364.85 365.32 B: (( plane )) 

365.05 366.43 A: for the particular act 

365.44 365.76 B: oh 

366.48 367.05 B: mhm 

369.79 371.78 B: now how close are to you to new york 

372.63 373.81 A: i'm pretty close 

373.61 375.04 B: did it affect you at all personally 

375.80 376.45 B: nine eleven 

378.99 380.94 B: i mean did you know anyone personally 

381.56 382.04 A: no 

382.14 382.48 B: no 

384.39 388.10 A: and i would i would say that that would probably be to my benefit 

387.92 388.43 B: mhm 

389.52 391.35 A: in evaluating the situation 

390.86 391.85 B: right absolutely 

393.34 397.50 A: so i mean so i guess i would i would i would counter you thing by saying you know 

398.13 399.93 A: looking for weapons is more 

400.26 404.46 A: what i would consider the aim then looking for particular 

404.64 408.07 A: because i i do think we were duped into thinking about the saudis 

408.22 408.73 B: mhm 

408.77 409.46 A: so 

414.33 416.27 A: that's just my particular take 

416.57 417.70 A: i don't know if you've done a lot of 

418.87 419.95 A: studying about 

420.48 422.22 A: bin laden i've read a few books 

421.31 422.94 B: no i haven't i really 

422.39 424.07 A: a few books about him 

423.91 427.65 B: no i i mean i basically keep up with it through the news papers and the news 

433.63 437.02 A: i think they should have much better technology for for finding weapons 

436.34 438.62 B: oh absolutely and i think it's out there too 

439.02 439.80 A: and i think (( )) 

440.03 441.11 A: i think they ought to 

441.48 444.46 A: pay the people who do the job more then minimum wage 

443.89 444.89 B: oh absolutely 

445.78 448.84 B: and you know my husband happens to be a ship captain he's all for 

452.06 453.25 B: carrying weapons also 

454.60 456.12 B: (( )) same kind of situation 

459.93 462.62 B: he's the got the responsibility of thousands of people you know 

465.98 466.46 A: right 

467.66 472.52 B: i don't know how i feel about that i don't particular want him carrying a weapon but i i 

472.70 474.26 B: i can understand his feelings 

476.22 478.44 B: his feeling need to defend himself and uh 

478.76 479.43 A: is that a 

479.66 480.16 A: yeah 

480.33 484.65 B: and the other people you know what i mean that he's basically taking a responsibility for 

488.09 490.61 A: is it a coincidence that your husband is in the 

491.05 491.85 A: airfield 

492.07 492.41 A: or 

492.75 496.23 A: would the question was submitted be 

494.11 495.47 B: you know what it's probably 

496.62 499.41 B: i think i answered that i answered that he was in the transportation 

501.84 502.89 B: if i'm not mistaken 

502.92 503.22 A: hm 

502.99 503.29 B: so 

503.42 504.17 B: that might have part 

504.27 504.62 B: part of 

504.31 506.49 A: now that just seems like a staggering coincidence 

506.30 506.82 B: mhm 

512.09 518.34 A: i mean i guess it's pretty interesting that they would have picked such a hot topic well i guess it would have been a lot hotter last year 

518.21 518.77 B: mhm 

518.95 519.67 B: absolutely 

520.52 521.06 A: but uh
