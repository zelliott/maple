12.31 17.01 B: yeah exactly [laughter] oh what do you think about the question 

16.99 22.01 A: i think that anybody who wants to really get onto a plane and do some damage is going to find a way to do it 

21.56 26.69 B: they're going to do it anyway you know they'll get through it i mean maybe it helps get some of the 

22.84 23.72 A: (( yeah )) 

26.73 28.87 B: the toenail clippers out but 

28.27 32.99 A: well you know it's just like a lock makes an honest person honest [laughter] 

32.29 38.09 B: exactly exactly they're still going to get through and they're still going to do what they want to on an airplane regardless 

33.09 34.06 A: [laughter] 

37.53 39.33 A: exactly we do 

39.40 40.44 A: for a living 

40.38 51.18 A: and um you know they talk about the the keeping all the knives and stuff out well excuse me but the bottom line is um if i wanted to i could take a knife right on 

40.44 41.56 B: oh 

49.46 50.22 B: (( [laughter] )) 

51.07 62.54 A: it would be made out of out of uh obsidian which is volcanic glass and obsidian is it goes down to one molecule that's what they used for eye surgery before they had lasers 

51.11 52.25 B: exactly 

55.67 56.46 B: (( yes )) 

62.22 66.88 B: ah well you know you can there's always ways they can find you know 

63.35 64.57 A: so you know 

65.08 71.08 A: yeah yeah i mean one way or the other if they are determined to get in and do some damage they're gonna 

70.59 77.83 B: yeah you know i mean there's just and look how many things that they have found trying to get on airplanes imagine how many they have not found 

77.46 79.93 A: yes exactly exactly 

79.48 85.25 B: you know there is just i truly think that they can just get through with anything they want to if they are 

85.43 89.37 B: seriously minded enough to do it they will find a way to do it 

88.98 91.50 A: i agree one hundred percent 

91.09 97.40 B: you know that's how a lot of the drugs and such come into our country is they find a way to do it [laughter] 

95.75 99.03 A: mhm and as soon as they plug up one hole they find another one 

98.85 99.57 B: (( yes )) 

99.22 100.76 A: [laughter] 

100.12 104.00 B: exactly and you know and if you have to fly you have to fly 

103.77 106.47 A: yeah yeah do you do much flying 

106.36 108.13 B: uh no not really 

107.81 113.31 A: i haven't for a while i did for a i was quite active with it for quite some time 

112.73 115.35 B: i did quite a bit a while back 

114.77 115.76 A: yeah 

115.36 121.27 B: but it's just me and my two teenagers now so we don't do a lot of flying any more [laughter] 

120.47 125.62 A: i understand i've got custody of a fifteen year old grandson [laughter] 

123.61 127.56 B: ah i have a fifteen year old and a thirteen year old so and they're both boys 

127.26 128.15 A: (( ah ha )) 

127.76 131.38 B: you know so we just we just don't do a lot of flying any more um 

130.80 132.28 A: no me either 

131.93 134.97 B: no it i just stay home pretty much 

132.68 134.29 A: (( it's not )) 

134.84 138.41 A: yes [laughter] when the kids around 

135.34 136.43 B: [laughter] 

137.66 140.32 B: oh yeah exactly [laughter] 

139.15 140.82 A: [laughter] 

140.62 144.55 B: [laughter] kids can uh be i tell you a whole handful 

144.26 145.56 A: that's for sure 

145.13 151.66 B: but you know after this whole nine one one thing i don't think either one of my kids would want- would wanted to have got on an airplane 

151.71 152.45 A: no 

152.26 154.84 B: because it's it's scary 

154.46 155.60 A: yes it is 

155.68 156.64 A: (( yes it is )) 

155.78 163.65 B: but you know i mean there was this woman on the news with all this terrorist attack the other d- um oh when it wasn't the other day my gosh it was new years eve 

163.85 168.59 B: and she was in las vegas we live near las vegas and um 

168.60 169.85 B: she says you know 

170.01 177.49 B: there there um has been some kind of terrorist warning on las vegas over new years eve and she says if they're gonna kill me they're gonna kill me 

177.37 178.22 A: mhm 

177.91 182.36 B: if you're flying in an airplane you have to think the exact same thing nowadays [laughter] 

181.49 183.98 A: exactly when it's your time to go it's your time to go 

183.73 188.13 B: well yeah and i kinda wonder too sometimes there's some people that get on the airplane 

188.25 191.29 B: that are allowed to carry a weapon on airplanes 

192.19 195.27 B: well what if they just lost their mind 

195.43 196.65 A: yeah 

196.01 202.48 B: would there be any difference in you know them killing everybody um someone who is allowed to have a weapon on an airplane 

202.17 203.43 A: exactly 

203.45 207.24 B: you know i mean i don't think there's any difference whatsoever [laughter] 

206.46 208.29 A: yeah yeah 

207.36 209.60 B: (( because they're going to get it through )) 

209.21 211.12 A: well and the bottom line is 

211.19 215.63 A: it is kinda like gun control if you take guns away from john q. public 

215.29 216.10 B: uh-huh 

215.98 219.37 A: only the the cops and the robbers have 'em [mn] 

218.76 220.81 B: yeah and the robbers outgun the cops 

220.24 222.23 A: you got it [laughter] 

220.82 223.12 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

222.42 231.66 A: i wintered in arizona for a few years and out there everybody can wear a gun on their hip as long as it is exposed you can carry any gun you want 

231.01 233.57 B: i lived in lake for quite a few years 

233.01 238.38 A: so you understand that and the crime was down because nobody knows if somebody's got 

238.24 239.47 B: exactly 

238.99 242.62 A: you know and they don't have the amount of crime that they have around here 

242.52 247.57 B: no no see where i live we have extremely little crime i live in southern utah 

247.33 248.36 A: (( ah a )) 

247.76 254.47 B: we moved up here about four or five years ago and there is very little crime it's beautiful it's a little too um 

250.13 252.33 A: beautiful state [laughter] 

254.61 257.85 B: [lipsmack] righteous just for me but um [mn] 

257.04 266.38 A: [laughter] i understand what you're saying i caught up in idaho the last couple of springs and i was a full time r._v.er 

266.17 267.10 B: (( [mn] )) 

266.43 268.30 A: and went off the goat trail and 

269.35 275.22 A: idaho and got into canyon and oh god it's wonderful there [laughter] 

274.38 277.09 B: oh it's absolutely gorgeous but you know here 

277.29 286.49 B: you have to get a permit to carry a gun you know and you have to have an if you want to conceal your gun you have to have it but you know what they give the classes down at the local pawn shops 

280.15 280.72 A: (( [mn] )) 

286.67 293.01 A: oh [laughter] well michigan's a little harder than that um they're relatively strict here which is fine 

293.23 301.31 A: i don't have a problem with that as long as people can still have access to them i don't believe in taking them away from everyone 

293.46 294.13 B: (( ah i )) 

294.90 295.70 B: don't 

300.96 302.15 B: (( either i don't )) 

301.50 307.12 A: only because you know crime is definitely deterred if you don't know if there is a gun on the other side of the door 

306.83 314.31 B: yeah exactly that's why i don't have a problem like with airlines some of the people i know that you know do with the 

312.30 313.48 A: [laughter] 

314.36 316.79 B: possibility of a pilot carrying a gun 

317.27 324.54 B: because jeez you know if someone comes to break into the cockpit um they can probably get that gun out real quick 

324.25 325.26 A: (( yup )) 

324.98 327.67 B: you know and save a lot of people on an airplane 

326.92 330.89 A: if they're capable of using it that's the next thing i mean i 

328.63 330.59 B: yeah exactly 

330.93 338.17 A: refused i was a full time r._v.er for ten years and i refused to carry a gun with me because it was only giving someone the ammunition to kill me with 

333.42 334.05 B: (( mm )) 

338.28 338.92 B: (( ex- )) 

339.10 341.41 B: [noise] haven't either uh are you there 

341.17 342.67 A: pardon yeah i'm here 

342.42 347.90 B: my phone just went click i don't understand that um we don't have one either just because i have teenagers 

348.44 351.22 B: you know i mean i live in a good neighbourhood you know but 

351.72 354.02 B: just 'cause i have teenagers i don't have a gun 

353.60 356.81 A: i don't blame you i wouldn't have one around here with my grandson 

356.60 359.90 B: oh no i'd have to lock it up and then what good is it 

359.31 361.37 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

360.69 365.92 B: [laughter] you know i'd say excuse me mr burglar hold on while i go get the ammunition in one room and the gun in the other room 

366.23 367.11 B: you know 

367.26 370.61 B: no no that that's not for me [laughter] 

369.59 372.84 A: yep i understand totally [laughter] 

371.27 372.64 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

373.17 378.16 A: and the bottom line is i could point it at him but i'd never be able to pull the trigger [laughter] 

376.75 380.61 B: you know yeah the only way i ever would is if my sons' lives were in danger 

379.94 382.76 A: yeah well i think maybe then i could but 

382.80 385.27 A: i'm just you know if it were just me 

385.24 386.40 B: yeah 

385.30 387.83 A: you you know they'd take it away from me and kill me 

387.56 389.81 B: oh me too oh sure oh sure 

388.82 391.58 A: why give them the ammunition [laughter] 

390.35 396.25 B: exactly exactly exactly god where did you find out about this survey 

397.40 398.41 A: (( through )) 

398.82 400.61 A: a big big
