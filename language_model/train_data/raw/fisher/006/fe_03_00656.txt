1.73 5.58 A: hi i'm sue from uh syracuse new york 

5.51 8.34 B: hi i'm donna from new jersey 

8.35 9.45 B: how're you doing 

9.20 11.10 A: good thank you how about you 

10.50 13.86 B: oh i'm doing okay what now we have to talk about uh 

13.93 15.11 A: (( security )) 

14.12 15.79 B: heightened security 

15.45 16.31 A: uh-huh 

17.03 30.58 A: yeah i just actually i was checking uh the uh price of tickets on line because i was planning for a trip in may and i just found a price hike due to the well so called uh height heightened security [laughter] 

30.52 35.35 B: [laughter] well that's right now we had the government had to uh 

31.23 32.79 A: (( [laughter] )) 

35.89 40.70 B: put in people and pay them a higher wage so that they'd do a better job 

38.97 43.53 A: i think they also had some kind of state of the art of technology 

43.12 44.70 B: oh was that what it was 

44.03 46.64 A: yeah that's very expensive 

46.27 47.21 B: yes 

47.67 51.95 B: so you think this is gonna uh lessen the uh 

52.64 54.63 B: chance of attack in the air 

54.73 59.45 A: mhm i don't really know but well better safe than sorry i guess 

60.64 63.95 B: yeah yeah i think uh 

66.48 67.91 B: i think it will make it 

68.48 71.43 B: more difficult to achieve 

71.60 73.16 B: but i don't know 

74.05 75.98 B: if it can stop 

76.60 78.16 B: because uh 

78.16 79.14 A: (( hm )) 

79.11 80.78 B: (( i uh )) 

81.12 83.22 B: uh took a plane 

83.11 84.07 A: mhm 

84.38 86.63 B: this past april 

87.31 88.08 A: (( oh )) 

87.40 92.17 B: to texas from new jersey philadelphia international airport 

89.59 90.73 A: mhm 

92.56 96.32 B: and uh we put our bags through the scan you know 

96.72 97.78 A: oh yeah mhm 

97.08 98.55 B: and uh 

99.15 105.02 B: i had a a nail clippers and they went through just fine 

104.92 106.04 A: mhm 

106.07 109.03 B: and then on the way back uh 

109.37 111.06 B: we had uh 

111.40 113.60 B: cho- uh we had our 

113.64 120.70 B: tickets that we used to to get to texas and accidentally gave those to the man to look at 

120.82 123.05 B: and he let us right on through 

122.86 124.13 A: [laughter] 

123.32 125.29 B: without valid tickets 

126.07 130.09 B: so uh we brought this to his attention and he was 

130.10 136.31 B: very upset you know he was very upset that he had allowed this to happen 

131.51 132.48 A: hm 

136.30 144.48 A: yeah but i guess it really depends on the locality like when i was flying to chicago in november last november 

136.70 137.71 B: (( you know )) 

144.56 153.00 A: i i think i got nothing wrong with me but i always got checked when i went through that security door it always bingoed 

153.06 158.55 A: and so the security staff just checked me in and out but nothing was found 

159.43 162.11 B: oh so it malfunctioned 

161.59 167.38 A: yeah well it i guess it's like uh they have a false negative and a false positive 

168.76 170.76 B: [mn] oh gee [laughter] 

171.04 172.20 B: oh gee 

173.25 179.33 A: so kind of i don't like to travel by the air very much now it just uh 

179.86 185.38 A: well and it's like people are lining up just because of the security checks 

185.53 188.07 A: because it takes longer than before 

188.35 190.56 B: [mn] yes a lot longer 

190.72 197.06 A: yeah especially like for a city of syracuse where there is only one gate open and everybody's lined up there 

197.01 198.85 B: [laughter] 

200.33 201.85 B: (( oh my )) 

202.32 204.37 B: yeah i'm not su- i i 

205.06 209.81 B: i think what what all this heightened security does is it's going to make 

209.87 212.61 B: anyone who wants to do something wrong 

211.65 212.41 A: (( [mn] )) 

212.79 219.76 B: a little wiser about how they can get away with it but i know personally myself 

219.36 220.53 A: mhm 

219.90 224.99 B: that i very easily well could was carrying a sharp object 

225.16 226.21 A: mhm 

225.63 231.72 B: and got away with it and then on the way home boarded a plane without having to use my tickets 

231.87 234.64 A: wow you saved some money [laughter] 

232.55 233.81 B: so uh 

234.01 239.48 B: yeah [laughter] well the ticket was already paid for yeah you know so 

235.85 238.33 A: well essentially you could [laughter] 

239.75 245.08 B: i guess if you want to do it you're gonna do it like the the man who had the bomb in his shoe 

243.36 253.74 A: yeah that that's what i think you know like if if you hire a security guard it he could only prevent you know the normal people not the thieves [laughter] 

253.48 255.06 B: right yeah 

254.50 257.31 A: like in a bank that's all would happen 

257.51 259.57 B: yes that's all that happens 

259.70 262.04 B: yeah so i hope uh 

262.16 264.68 B: i don't know i hope it works out i 

264.39 272.79 A: but i think it's like a pose that you have to take to show that uh we have the determination to achieve this 

273.15 274.09 A: so 

273.47 275.55 B: oh yes you have to take 

274.46 281.03 A: you cannot just sit there and you know do nothing as a political move this is pretty wise 

281.06 284.47 B: oh yes oh yes this has to be done 

284.62 286.24 B: it has to be done 

286.12 288.92 A: otherwise the voters would just be mad at them 

289.49 300.33 B: [laughter] the voters would be mad you know i with all this heightened security i don't remember them announcing that they actually caught any terrorists 

300.70 301.85 A: mhm 

303.53 304.37 B: you know 

304.55 306.18 A: i'm not sure 

306.09 312.13 B: i know there were a couple of people that were arrested in florida but it turned out that they weren't um 

312.65 319.62 B: terrorists at all i think maybe what we should concentrate on is making sure our pilots are not inebriated 

319.17 320.76 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

319.98 323.72 B: [laughter] a lot of drunk pilots any more 

320.82 322.21 A: (( well [laughter] )) 

323.58 326.47 A: oh oh well that's too bad 

324.78 325.90 B: right 

326.13 328.73 B: they are i mean two more 

328.78 329.74 B: uh 

330.18 335.75 B: two weeks ago two more were caught drunk and i don't know if this is a new thing 

336.03 337.29 B: or 

337.31 341.08 B: it's just people are more aware of it or 

340.03 343.48 A: it's a this is a plot or they're just 

343.43 348.62 B: or they're drinking because they're nervous because they do have to fly a plane 

344.15 345.49 A: alcoholics 

348.41 353.26 A: i don't think so well i don't think they're trained to behave like this 

353.66 356.00 A: i mean to drink alcohol to 

356.07 359.95 A: make it to solve the nervousness no no way 

359.92 367.32 B: well i i don't think they trained 'em that way but i wouldn't be surprised if there are a lot of nervous pilots 

367.68 371.27 B: and they want to carry guns and 

367.73 369.24 A: yeah 

371.68 375.31 B: oh gee it's a mess i have to take a flight 

375.52 376.42 A: mhm 

375.62 378.14 B: next month to florida and i 

377.79 378.94 A: mhm 

378.35 385.48 B: not looking forward to it i'm trying to think of a way to not possibly i could take a train we could drive 

384.25 386.38 A: hm that's too long 

385.92 389.04 B: but the time yeah the time you spent 

389.27 391.48 B: you lose you know it's 

391.51 403.76 A: yeah actually you know last winter i met a guy in amtrak i was taking amtrak just from new york to boston so it's pretty close but that guy was traveling from arizona to new york 

404.15 405.54 B: wow 

404.93 406.87 A: on the amtrak train 

406.98 408.40 B: wow 

407.75 417.08 A: i think he spent a couple of nights on the train as well as well as three days and he said he just hated you know the security check 

410.48 412.08 B: i'm sure he did 

418.98 420.37 B: [mn] on the train 

420.43 426.88 A: [laughter] well no on the on the on the f- he doesn't he didn't take a plane because of the security checks 

427.67 431.51 A: so and he he thought it might be safer to take the train 

427.78 428.54 B: oh 

431.55 437.31 B: it might be safer but he sure did spend a lot of time to avoid a security check 

433.55 435.40 A: (( it's too slow )) 

437.48 438.99 B: [laughter] 

438.30 439.97 A: [laughter] 

439.07 442.84 B: i mean a security check delays you but not for three days 

440.20 441.34 A: [laughter] 

443.37 447.80 B: well i mean [laughter] that's not a good reason [laughter] 

444.26 445.66 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

446.83 454.25 A: [laughter] and it's well it's much more comfortable if you stay for three days in the air- airport hotel than on the amtrak train [laughter] 

448.93 449.83 B: (( yeah )) 

453.67 459.99 B: oh gee yes yes and the amtrak trains aren't so safe anymore anyway 

454.45 455.89 A: [laughter] 

459.57 460.97 A: (( no )) 

460.17 463.28 B: it's all getting old the rails are old and 

462.58 465.97 A: and they were always late they were never never on time 

466.17 467.69 B: i've taken an 

467.92 474.76 A: well i just take it like once or twice and every time i discover something new and horrible 

475.92 477.52 B: it was horrible 

476.85 478.27 A: [laughter] it was 

478.00 478.88 B: [laughter] 

478.66 487.41 A: last time it was i guess three or four hours late the original journey was only six hours but it was four hours late 

487.92 489.82 A: so we traveled ten hours 

490.77 491.85 B: oh my 

491.55 493.53 A: it was horrible so 

493.82 495.35 B: (( oh my [laughter] )) 

494.51 498.82 A: if i could i would i'd i'd rather go through the security door [laughter] 

500.98 503.27 B: yeah it's not difficult to do 

502.86 512.21 A: i guess if you're not taking an international airliners it wouldn't be that [mn] uh it wouldn't have a high possibility of you know getting really 

512.37 513.75 A: bad 

513.84 517.44 A: 'cause they only hijack those long distance 

517.49 518.74 A: flights 

520.73 522.82 B: mhm let me think 

522.75 524.92 A: because they need enough oil 

525.35 529.45 A: enough gas in in the engine for the engine if they want to 

529.47 530.66 A: really 

530.93 532.30 A: go somewhere 

532.24 535.08 B: that's true unless they carry a bomb 

535.47 539.52 A: oh a bomb will not go through the security door 

536.55 537.54 B: they then 

543.54 549.91 B: well how did the bomb go through the plastic explosive go through when the man had it in his shoe 

550.81 561.44 A: yeah that's why when i went through the security door that uh that the device just bingoed and they just check my shoes and i was so surprised why they were focusing on my shoes 

561.77 562.79 B: [laughter] 

561.98 563.79 A: [laughter] 

562.97 565.23 B: because of the man with the shoe bomb 

564.21 571.17 A: yeah because i didn't think of that at the time and i was so surprised because the lady said you just please take off your shoes 

567.59 569.09 B: yeah that's right 

570.73 571.81 B: mhm 

571.95 574.10 B: so you could have had it in your hair 

573.85 578.59 A: [mn] oh they didn't check my hair though and actually when i 

578.61 589.06 A: i remember once my luggage was also checked but the min- the man didn't really take notice he just um rifled through very very quickly and said okay it's fine just go 

589.31 590.24 B: yeah 

589.66 595.22 A: so i guess i if i really have something inside i might still be able to take it with me 

594.93 596.01 B: yes 

595.40 598.39 A: because they didn't really check you know in details 

597.17 599.89 B: no no and can you imagine
