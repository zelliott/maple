91.36 91.77 B: oh 

92.25 96.59 A: so just the feeling not knowing that my family was okay 

97.01 97.47 B: right 

97.97 102.09 A: you know it kind of does something to you it's kind of uh 

103.64 106.60 A: it's scary it's scary and 

105.05 106.08 B: yeah i can imagine 

106.80 107.46 A: several 

108.17 110.17 A: lives were lost people that i 

110.41 117.34 A: knew as a child and you know the kind that makes you think twice scary 

117.83 118.36 A: scary 

119.21 122.34 A: but you know it's some- like you can't keep dwelling on it 

123.39 127.29 B: no no you can't cause then you'll live your life scared and you won't get any thing accomplished 

127.44 136.95 A: that's right that's right you know you can't live in fear you know but sometimes it's easier to just give into the fear and just be afraid and go hide somewhere 

136.97 138.36 B: [laugh] yeah 

137.47 140.75 A: but you can't you just can't do that life has to go on

142.16 143.81 A: like you know i'm 

144.58 145.07 A: always 

145.20 145.84 A: you know 

146.07 150.02 A: in the back of my mind i'm always like waiting for the next thing 

150.13 161.44 A: you know well when is that going to be every time there's a holiday like the fourth of july christmas new years eve you know anytime there's any thing that comes up you say to yourself 

157.14 157.70 B: yeah

165.58 166.97 A: i go 

167.07 168.88 B: yeah (( )) 

167.90 171.06 A: you know what i mean i go because i know i can't do that 

171.95 172.38 B: yeah 

171.96 172.52 A: wait 

172.91 175.36 A: that's about it other than that you know 

176.58 184.20 A: may- maybe just a little careful more careful about how i spend money too i think i'm a little more careful with my money now i think i think 

184.59 187.01 A: think a little bit more before i spend 

187.69 194.39 A: just because there's a fact that um you know like they said the terrorists might take our banks down 

195.11 195.60 B: yeah 

195.81 200.26 A: yeah it's not that i have anything much in the bank believe me 

199.16 200.41 B: right [laugh] 

200.53 201.52 A: you know i mean 

200.56 203.94 B: that would make it even worse if it was gone [laugh] 

208.85 209.41 A: privacy 

209.56 219.13 A: dollars instead of spending it you know i can walk into the dollar store and i can spend twenty five or thirty dollars without blinking my eyes you know 

215.27 217.92 B: [laugh] yeah me too 

218.80 219.35 B: yeah 

219.94 220.59 A: but it 

220.84 221.94 A: you know that's a very 

222.03 223.59 A: all that's really changed 

225.17 226.71 B: yeah it it didn't really 

226.81 234.16 B: affect me much i don't have family in new york i don't fly so i avoid that whole situation um 

234.93 242.66 A: yeah well pretty much i think if i didn't have you know family in new york i don't know if i ever would have gotten back on a plane again 

239.50 240.28 B: right 

243.12 245.46 A: and i have never been afraid to fly 

243.20 243.77 B: right 

246.23 248.44 A: but i i think that hm 

248.90 254.29 A: having my family there it was more of a matter of like i don't do it i'm not going to see them 

254.73 255.19 B: right 

255.23 264.16 A: you know it's easy to go out and go oh you're never going to see your family again or you're going to get on a plane and do it because it's too difficult for my daughter to come out here with the kids 

264.73 266.27 A: it's easier for me to go there 

266.75 268.54 A: and they wouldn't want her to put the kids on 

269.92 270.34 B: right 

270.12 276.40 A: so more or less it was like i made up my mind i'm just going to do it just like i always did it and i don't go that often 

276.51 279.56 A: you know two or three four times a year sometimes but 

280.25 280.83 A: i wanted 

281.42 287.34 A: just be able to get on the plane and go so i'm glad that i initially did it because if i didn't you know 

288.24 288.64 B: right 

288.95 289.90 A: you know i wouldn't 

289.35 289.73 B: (( )) 

290.08 291.28 A: wouldn't see them 

291.67 292.40 A: miss two 

291.69 293.17 B: yeah i i don't think 

293.38 297.69 B: uh new york suppose to worry about anymore of them cause there's nothing else for them to ruin there 

298.02 300.30 B: [laugh] (( )) somewhere else 

298.52 299.77 A: yeah well actually 

299.96 300.44 A: i don't 

300.62 303.77 A: uh my opinion is i don't think that they would 

304.17 306.99 A: go back and do anything in new york because i think 

307.25 308.64 A: first of all they would ex- 

309.10 311.51 A: -pect that that's what we would expect 

311.57 312.08 B: right 

312.46 317.97 A: you know i think if anything happens it's going to be some place were nobody would even think about 

318.44 318.92 B: right 

320.76 327.21 B: (( )) yeah i live in cleveland and it was a little scary for me at the time seeing as the one plane was heading towards us 

327.79 331.06 B: [laugh] the one that crashed in pennsylvania 

331.93 332.50 B: and 

332.81 335.12 B: it turned around right over our air space 

335.40 336.37 A: oh god 

336.04 336.51 B: so 

336.65 339.59 B: i don't know were they were going [laugh] 

339.76 340.17 B: but 

340.55 345.05 B: i i'm not (( )) i mean i'm very sad that it happened to you know that 

345.13 350.70 B: for all the families and all the people that lives were lost i'm very sad for them but at the same time i'm 

350.95 351.85 B: you know i'm glad that it 

352.03 354.57 B: nothing did happen in cleveland when they could have easily 

354.86 358.92 B: you know we have a lot of big buildings in downtown cleveland where they turned around 

357.40 358.14 A: right 

359.03 360.60 B: they could have easily hit one of those 

359.21 359.99 A: right 

360.95 361.49 A: right 

362.84 366.15 A: right it that was a terrible thing it was awful 

366.73 368.02 A: it was really awful 

368.59 369.26 B: yeah well 

369.38 377.95 A: hm but you don't know you know it could be anywhere next time it could be any place at all but i think it's going to be somewhere where i don't think it's going 

378.11 384.70 A: i don't why i think that i don't think it's going to be in a place like cleveland or eh in a big city 

385.33 385.83 B: yeah 

386.00 386.76 A: i just don't 

387.43 389.21 A: i don't know i just feel like 

389.73 392.33 A: they would think that we're too ready for it 

393.57 396.52 B: well i worry about big events (( )) the super bowl 

396.62 403.17 B: in places where you know well i don't worry about the super bowl anymore it's over but i'm saying like places where a lot of people gather together 

403.35 403.97 A: right 

404.11 404.62 A: right 

405.10 406.09 B: because that would be 

406.36 411.03 B: if i were thinking as a terrorist that would be the best places cause you'll hit as many people 

410.64 411.61 A: sure 

411.92 417.58 A: sure yeah this you're hitting a hell a lot of people and and yeah [laugh]

438.18 440.66 A: yeah i agree with you i agree with you

446.05 446.53 B: yeah 

446.30 447.87 A: you know that they have to be 

448.14 450.35 A: brought up in this kind of an atmosphere
