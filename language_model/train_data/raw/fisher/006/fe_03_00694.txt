0.33 1.56 B: hello 

1.06 2.38 A: hello 

2.24 3.12 B: (( hi )) 

3.60 4.69 B: i'm esky 

4.72 5.82 A: i'm roger 

5.74 6.94 B: nice to meet you 

6.58 7.45 A: (( you too )) 

8.67 11.78 B: so what are we supposed to talk about 

11.33 15.23 A: um i guess we're supposed to talk about airport security i guess 

14.97 16.01 B: okay 

16.00 16.93 A: um 

17.88 22.78 A: they say they want to know if we're if we think it's going to help at all 

23.12 24.00 B: so 

24.51 34.59 A: i've flown once since the terrorist attacks in um two thousand one and i they seem pretty thorough actually i had nail clippers in my 

34.73 39.56 A: school bag at one point and i didn't realize i put them in there and they found them so 

41.59 46.61 A: i think that i think that it's going to help i don't really understand exactly why they're searching for every 

46.77 50.86 A: for nail clippers and stuff like that like i understand that it cold be used as a weapon but you know 

50.88 52.52 B: (( [cough] nail clippers )) 

52.73 59.51 A: yeah like things you clip your nails with yeah 

55.93 57.34 B: yeah okay 

58.13 61.17 B: oh and what did they do with them did they take them 

60.75 73.45 A: they they they took them i could have i didn't really need them because you can just go to the dollar store and buy other ones but they took them i didn't have a problem with that because they just didn't want it on the plane i guess 

73.84 79.17 B: (( yeah but how are you are supposed to clip your nails if they take your nail clip mhm )) 

79.33 87.86 A: well again like i can just i just i didn't realize i put them in there and i can just go like it was my mistake 'cause i accidentally put them in the carry on luggage 

87.77 96.40 A: so i just figured that i can just go to the dollar store and get like another one or something like that so it wasn't really a big deal for me if i had something of value i might ask them to 

96.44 103.50 A: like hold it and put it on my carry on not my carry on but my checked baggage or something like that 

102.86 104.14 B: (( i )) 

104.51 109.32 B: see so when do you think we should stop at what point i mean 

109.42 115.19 A: well i have like i have no problem going through like the security checkpoints and stuff like that but the one of 

115.32 122.28 A: the things that i thought was a little too far was when they decided like i fly usually out of philly international 

122.25 132.26 A: and they were checking shoes that was about the time that that shoe bomber was going off and i just didn't i thought it was a little weird that they were checking shoes but i understand why they're doing 

131.99 135.13 B: actually they did check my shoes when i was um 

133.04 137.15 A: (( it )) 

135.19 139.34 B: leaving or coming i'm not sure but they did check my shoes 

139.46 145.62 B: actually they checked no actually it was at j._f._k. they checked everyone's shoes they had everyone to take off their shoes 

145.83 148.13 B: (( and before going through the ah )) 

149.55 151.36 B: the gate 

150.64 152.53 A: do you think that's too far or 

152.79 156.84 B: (( oh considering that there was a person that ah )) 

154.53 176.27 A: (( yeah )) 

157.21 163.09 B: had sort of a made up bomb in his shoe and tried to explode it in flight 

163.18 167.87 B: then i don't think it's that excessive but um 

169.42 171.87 B: i'm not sure how long 

171.90 175.51 B: um to what extent you can actually um 

176.01 179.26 B: keep this going for how long because let's say 

179.47 184.82 B: you have another terrorist attack involving the airport security and so forth 

185.39 192.86 B: something similar at least then you need other measures and then others and then others so we have to let's say 

193.45 197.42 B: rule a line and try and let's say uh 

198.50 203.35 B: prevent the problem that is per- try and solve the um 

205.96 208.39 B: (( determine what this terrorist )) 

208.82 213.56 B: attacks instead of preventing them through um extra security whatever 

214.17 225.64 A: well also part of what i think part of what i think happened during the terrorist attacks where i think some people i thought i remember them saying that some of it was the employees had planted some of the things on the planes 

225.63 232.42 A: so i think those people also need to go through some sort of security to make sure that they're not bringing things on to the plane so it shouldn't be there also 

232.42 238.33 B: oh yeah that's true because i've seen the um a lot of you know airports and the um the 

239.04 246.75 B: airports at least being pilots and the um stewardess don't go through those security checks or that's a possibility too so 

246.46 250.58 A: yeah and all those people like the people who bring the food on to the plane 

249.20 252.39 B: (( yeah and the work and everything so you never know )) 

251.82 261.75 A: (( yeah )) 

253.55 256.46 B: (( but you know there's always )) 

260.40 264.12 B: um things change after something bad happens 

264.29 266.19 B: (( the problem is you )) 

266.32 277.02 B: don't have to change it too much in order to make it let's say an inconvenience to the people and the public because right now you have to be ah let's say three hours before your flight at the airport 

277.48 283.20 B: it's too much pain too much time to wait there three hours and then wait and then 

283.30 284.46 B: it's crazy 

284.33 288.51 A: part of part of the point of flying was that it was supposed to be faster than any other way 

287.56 290.11 B: yeah and it takes now i don't know 

290.29 294.93 B: how long it should be like a bus i think that's the way to uh 

295.31 302.41 B: (( let's say trip flying in the sense that i think if you travel and the people whatever should be um )) 

302.55 305.21 B: one hundred percent isolated 

304.88 305.90 A: mhm 

305.57 313.36 B: so there will be there would be no less interference between the uh pilot and the um whoever is running the thing 

313.56 315.70 B: and have had these instances before 

315.45 319.88 A: yeah so at least you can at least land the plane and 

318.28 322.67 B: yeah land it and let's make sure that this thing doesn't happen 

322.24 325.40 A: yeah so you can't use the plane as a weapon itself 

324.58 328.96 B: yeah and now i believe the problem then [noise] is 

329.16 330.64 B: because i didn't do any 

331.53 336.65 B: (( internal flights before let's say um non international flights )) 

336.99 341.81 B: so do they check shoes and they check bags and as 

341.98 343.01 B: (( ah )) 

343.86 344.90 B: um 

345.21 346.77 B: an international flight 

347.68 358.76 A: um i would think that they would i think that it would probably be better if like they made sure that the checked baggage definitely would like be they all were screened too 

358.32 360.09 B: (( mhm )) 

360.02 361.86 A: (( well )) 

360.19 366.41 B: but do they do that do they check like the internal flights do they check those things do they do all sort of the same things 

362.36 372.01 A: right now they screen a hundred percent of the baggage for international flights but not for domestic flights 

371.71 373.25 B: (( oh i )) 

372.28 379.33 A: i think that's part of it too because it's easy you could just easily put something on it like in a bag like that 

376.21 376.81 B: (( see )) 

379.30 380.32 B: mhm 

379.73 385.84 A: like you could just easily put something in a bag that's going on a domestic flight and easily just blow it up in the air 

385.80 388.59 B: yes i don't think that's happened before but 

390.38 393.38 B: (( maybe let's not give them any ideas [laughter] )) 

392.47 404.71 A: [laughter] what yeah definitely like at least come up with a way to get people through the lines faster because and you can't keep it keep it you have to find better ways of getting people through that line too 

404.08 405.25 B: (( mhm )) 

406.25 416.62 A: like like what do you think about you know how they're gonna come up with a frequent flyer card for people so that they can just get moved through the line faster because they fly so often do you think that's a good idea 

415.91 417.59 B: i think that's discrimination 

417.93 419.17 B: (( [laughter] )) 

418.53 422.49 A: [laughter] 

419.48 425.46 B: (( it would certainly help me because i'm let's say a frequent flyer but uh i don't think that's fair )) 

428.48 430.31 B: wait in line and that's it 

430.36 433.96 B: why should they get preferential treatment if they fly often that's stupid 

431.09 431.65 A: (( [cough] )) 

433.67 443.52 A: you mean like the way an airline would do now how they have like the special lines for the travelers that travel all the time and stuff like that mhm 

440.55 446.61 B: no the special lines they have is because they pay more there is economy and business if you pay more then okay 

447.89 456.14 B: that's fine but besides that why should there be preferential lines when you're going through security that's stupid 

456.41 464.52 B: security is for everyone it's like having different courts to judge the rich people and different courts to judge the poor people do 

464.80 466.75 B: you see my point 

465.97 467.56 A: (( yeah )) 

466.89 471.07 B: (( so i don't think that should be implemented it's um it's discrimination )) 

471.72 479.24 A: do you like the way do you like um do you like the fact that the united states government took over the airport security in the united states 

479.28 480.93 B: well 

482.91 495.69 B: despite the fact that most people let's say in the united states like as much the let's say in government taking over control and so on i think certain things should be left to the government even though um 

487.10 491.77 A: mhm 

496.22 506.02 B: she may not do a good job as you're supposed to but the point is that uh if you trust something to government um 

506.04 509.56 B: you're not same in a sense sure that you're gonna have 

509.76 511.52 B: minimum performance 

510.63 515.18 A: mhm 

511.69 519.96 B: absolute minimum performance which is let's say is in a sort of way guaranteed where as in a business you may have a um 

519.99 522.41 B: let's say an advertised minimum 

522.44 527.16 B: (( performance but actual minimum performance is actually much )) 

527.69 529.81 A: well yeah i think i think 

529.15 533.24 B: (( less in a public business let's say what they show )) 

533.50 535.87 B: is something different of what they are 

535.79 540.23 A: like the business is gonna try and do it at the lowest cost possible 

538.23 540.18 B: yes exactly 

540.68 547.09 B: i'm not saying that they may not do it better than they may do it better but when you need let's say an absolute minimum performance 

547.23 548.58 B: from a certain 

548.69 552.57 B: let's say a credible facility credible business then 

553.15 556.00 B: (( without considering cost you should do it on you own )) 

556.05 568.91 A: yeah well i think also the federal government at least can standardize it from airport to airport so it's not like you have we have people just running like i know it's not necessarily that way now but maybe at least over 

568.82 571.31 A: while they get this definitely um 

571.70 573.52 A: (( implemented i think that they cam )) 

573.68 579.46 A: train people the same way so everybody has the same background so you can have some sort of the same kind of 

579.88 582.74 A: some sort of standardization 

582.47 583.56 B: (( yeah )) 

582.93 584.65 A: of the security measures 

584.04 585.80 B: (( that's important )) 

587.12 588.20 B: (( yeah )) 

589.93 594.45 B: (( what did you think about that um )) 

594.96 597.81 B: (( that they advertised so much before )) 

598.83 599.95 B: (( have you seen the news ))
