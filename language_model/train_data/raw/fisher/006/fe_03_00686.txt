8.27 10.39 B: oh okay well this is my first 

10.27 15.34 A: okay well i had another one earlier tonight so it's kinda breaking in gradually 

12.87 13.92 B: okay 

14.88 18.59 B: yeah so we're supposed to talk about airport security 

17.31 19.45 A: airport security [noise] 

18.93 26.10 B: i don't know i [laughter] i've been kinda nervous about it ever since the terrorist you know about flying 

26.17 27.12 A: uh-huh 

26.61 27.53 B: um 

27.65 34.12 B: ever since the uh you know september eleventh thing [noise] what about you are you a easy flier or a 

30.05 31.75 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

33.85 39.15 A: um yeah i think so i would i i'd get on a plane in a heartbeat 

36.10 37.33 B: yeah 

38.59 42.34 B: yeah well i have to get on one next week so [laughter] i've gotta get on there 

40.83 42.41 A: oh really where you going 

42.61 43.65 B: to denver 

43.35 45.12 A: oh wow from 

44.65 46.58 B: from um maryland 

46.00 50.00 A: oh wow yeah so you're probably pretty nervous 

47.45 49.15 B: [laughter] 

49.42 51.66 B: yeah yeah i mean 

50.09 51.23 A: yeah 

52.11 62.33 B: i guess you know i felt i always thought of ways that they could um you know bomb planes before i guess i'm kinda paranoid like that and then after that happened wow 

59.75 60.87 A: yeah 

62.14 65.47 A: well does the heightened security make you feel more comfortable about it 

65.12 72.43 B: um [sigh] yeah yeah it does i mean i just i'm really a lot more comfortable now that they got these um 

67.35 68.31 A: yeah 

72.61 82.04 B: [lipsmack] the machines that screen for bombs and all the luggage 'cause i think that you know that's one of the things i thought about you know that would be easy to do 

75.09 76.02 A: uh-huh 

76.48 77.28 A: yeah 

81.67 82.68 A: right 

82.38 85.65 B: 'cause you know they didn't they don't ever screen all of them but 

85.07 88.33 A: right but now they do right yeah 

86.76 90.19 B: yeah well they just started so 

88.92 90.88 A: yeah yeah 

90.27 94.39 B: it does make me feel better but i guess i'm just you know a nervous flier anyway so 

93.61 95.57 A: yeah have you flown much 

95.30 96.26 B: um 

96.55 99.95 B: yeah i mean well maybe about thirty or forty times 

99.29 100.33 A: yeah 

100.06 105.00 B: i was real nervous when i first started and then it just kinda got you routine 

104.56 105.66 A: yeah 

105.05 107.68 B: until this happened and then i started thinking er 

107.32 108.88 A: mhm 

108.03 109.39 B: yeah what about you 

109.24 120.21 A: well [mn] no i my very first time i flew i was a nervous wreck but um since then i found out how easy it is i just it's so much easier than going any other way 

113.92 115.42 B: yeah 

117.58 118.53 B: yeah 

119.46 121.35 B: yeah it's like taking the bus 

121.03 131.82 A: right and i believe that when your time is up your time is up you know no matter where you are right right right and i would not want to go that way 

124.34 125.31 B: yeah 

125.34 128.36 B: there's just nothing you can do right yeah 

131.35 132.39 B: right 

132.18 135.70 A: but if it happened it happened you know 

134.00 136.40 B: yeah yeah 

135.84 138.03 A: i think the heightened security 

139.42 152.65 A: uh almost doesn't ease my mind because you know you get crackpots out there that are going to try to break the system it's like hackers on computers you know you tell them they can't do it 

142.70 143.83 B: yeah 

147.87 149.53 B: right try to break through 

150.28 151.26 B: yeah 

152.42 154.68 B: oh yeah it's a challenge 

152.65 156.86 A: and they're gonna find a way yeah yeah it's like a challenge to 'em 

154.75 155.88 B: yeah 

156.43 157.71 B: yeah 

157.11 161.15 A: and and the fact that i haven't flown since nine eleven 

160.71 161.91 B: yeah 

161.30 162.30 A: but 

162.64 164.60 A: how long it takes now 

164.69 165.81 B: yeah 

165.06 170.90 A: you know from start to finish from the time you have to be at the airport and go through all this and 

170.04 177.53 B: yeah i flew let's see last year about this time i flew like five or six times and that was my first time be- since 

173.83 174.61 A: uh-huh 

177.48 178.47 A: yeah 

177.49 189.98 B: the terrorist thing and i mean it didn't take that i mean the worst of it was over you know it didn't take that long it was a lot better then i had thought it would be but now i don't know now that they put these federal um 

183.86 185.00 A: right 

186.06 187.22 A: right 

190.38 193.25 B: federal inspectors in how different it is 

192.66 194.71 A: right right i 

194.52 196.35 B: i always get stopped anyway 

196.03 198.08 A: do you [laughter] 

196.52 200.92 B: [laughter] i always get my bag searched for bomb 

200.57 201.95 A: yeah 

201.54 202.79 B: i don't know why 

202.38 204.42 A: yeah does it make you nervous 

204.29 208.70 B: no i mean i know i don't have any bombs so [laughter] 

205.05 206.44 A: is it like being 

206.63 210.88 A: yeah i know but to be singled out is like you know 

209.15 219.12 B: yeah no i mean i don't i don't know why i don't know maybe i just uh you know it's every fifth person and i just coincidently keep being the fifth person you never know 

216.81 218.27 A: that fifth person 

218.71 219.72 A: yeah 

219.67 220.63 B: yeah 

221.23 225.33 A: yeah now i don't know i think if they really 

226.20 228.91 A: want to do it it's gonna be done 

227.31 228.30 B: mhm 

228.82 229.76 B: yeah 

229.55 232.51 A: no matter how much they heighten the security 

229.78 230.89 B: of course 

231.81 233.41 B: yeah 

234.22 237.13 B: yeah i mean you can always come up with [noise] some creative way 

236.91 238.49 A: right 

237.28 241.04 B: especially when they keep publicizing exactly what they're checking for 

240.31 248.79 A: exac- yeah exactly and you know what they're doing exactly they know exactly what they're doing and 

241.19 243.43 B: [laughter] 

243.61 244.63 B: yeah 

247.07 253.24 B: yeah and people keep getting through like all these newspaper reporters keep getting through with guns and knives and 

251.55 257.91 A: right right and like i said before as far as just like computer hackers 

253.73 254.61 B: so 

257.52 258.66 B: yeah 

258.20 259.80 A: they gonna you know 

259.27 269.09 B: yeah well that's what i mean you know not that i would do this but if i were a terrorist i used to live in colorado right next to one of the air traffic control centers 

268.52 269.43 A: uh-huh 

269.17 275.48 B: um so in that building there's maybe a hundred a hundred and fifty controllers with all the air space over 

275.53 279.98 B: you know i don't know how many square mile area from denver to kansas city 

277.93 279.25 A: right 

279.51 281.31 A: right 

280.12 284.61 B: i just and there was a little airport near there i'd just fly into that thing 

284.24 285.41 A: right 

284.79 290.34 B: and knock a hundred controllers off the air at once i mean there's always something you can do if you're evil 

287.62 289.15 A: exactly 

289.81 303.67 A: exactly and and all this terrorist at the airport may stop them from boarding the planes and causing the terror but like you said look at these towers you know they're pretty much wide open 

290.55 291.57 B: (( you know )) 

293.58 294.58 B: yeah 

296.64 297.81 B: right 

300.24 301.40 B: yeah 

303.32 304.65 B: (( mhm )) 

303.99 313.92 A: to get to 'em um i deliver mail i'm a mail carrier and we had a concern with we have a mail truck that goes 

305.42 306.69 B: yeah 

307.05 308.22 B: oh yeah 

314.12 318.00 A: right to that tower in our town every day 

315.76 316.60 B: uh-huh 

316.70 317.67 B: right 

318.06 318.97 B: right 

318.15 322.01 A: now our mail trucks aren't secured at night in maine 

319.71 321.08 B: what town are you in 

321.62 322.84 B: in maine okay 

322.10 323.76 A: (( yeah maine )) 

323.97 326.00 A: our mail truck's not secured at night 

325.33 326.11 B: right 

326.21 328.97 A: you know who's to stop somebody 

326.81 327.68 B: yeah 

328.04 330.58 B: someone could out something in it and yeah 

329.41 335.90 A: exactly so you know if they really want to do it they can do it 

333.21 338.82 B: yeah unless we have a police state where everyone gets searched all the time some things are always going to get through 

336.93 337.93 A: mhm 

338.41 339.80 A: exactly 

339.11 344.18 B: you can catch some of them but you know something eventually is going to happen if they want it to and i guess you can't just 

342.54 344.01 A: (( if they want )) 

344.60 347.16 B: worrying about it is not really going to help you know [laughter] 

346.41 353.50 A: it i think you need to work more on relations with other countries and you know 

350.57 351.46 B: right 

352.40 353.41 B: yeah 

353.67 354.60 B: yeah 

354.02 355.49 A: and less on 

356.11 361.17 A: uh i don't know in your face type of you know 

359.86 360.90 B: right 

362.18 363.21 A: but 

363.52 367.23 A: so anyway i think this is interesting yeah 

365.50 369.02 B: yeah [laughter] so what was your other topic before this 

368.79 369.71 A: same thing 

369.62 371.93 B: oh airport security oh okay 

370.49 382.33 A: yeah same thing but it was with a gentleman and it was very strained you know it was he was having a hard time talking to me and i was having a hard time talking to him 

373.93 374.75 B: uh-huh 

376.69 377.80 B: oh really 

380.31 381.16 B: right 

381.86 382.83 B: right 

382.60 385.40 A: and i wonder if that isn't what they're doing trying to 

384.37 385.80 B: where was he from 

385.65 387.79 A: uh iowa 

387.20 393.83 B: okay i think they're putting different because i'm from georgia originally you're in maine he's in the mid west they're probably hooking up 

390.28 391.21 A: yeah 

391.31 392.20 A: yeah 

392.31 393.21 A: yeah 

394.08 402.30 B: people with different accents to get us to talk about the same thing like if i say airplane and you say airplane then it can tell 

398.23 399.73 A: exactly 

402.41 406.85 B: oh this person sounds different than this but they both are saying airplane 

406.39 412.52 A: right right and i think to see how well people relate to each other 

407.30 408.32 B: yeah 

412.17 414.26 B: yeah uh-huh 

412.80 420.29 A: you know you know it's been easy talking yeah it's been easy talking to you where it was strained talking to him 

415.14 418.00 B: total strangers [laughter] 

419.91 428.75 B: well guys aren't very good on the phone anyway i think [laughter] they just sit there and you have to ask you know well ask a question and they go yeah [laughter] 

421.17 424.01 A: no they're not [laughter] 

425.05 425.99 A: yeah 

426.96 433.88 A: yeah unless he's my twenty one year old son then he's got a growth on his ear [laughter] but 

431.22 433.00 B: oh yeah [laughter] 

433.23 442.03 B: that's like my brother won't i mean he's terrible on the phone i mean he's my brother i've known him my whole life and [noise] he's just you know ask him a question yeah everything's fine 

436.98 438.19 A: yeah 

441.78 443.13 A: yeah 

442.36 444.17 B: my dad's the same way so 

443.38 447.03 A: yeah yeah that's how most men are they just don't i 

446.04 451.64 B: [laughter] don't have any verbal ability [laughter] [laughter] 

447.04 448.02 A: don't know 

448.58 458.76 A: [laughter] yeah apprehensive [laughter] so i guess if we are done talking about security that we can just that's the end of it yeah 

455.06 455.90 B: uh-huh 

456.49 457.78 B: we just hang up 

457.94 462.86 B: okay i didn't know i thought maybe we're supposed to talk for a certain amount of time and then it would go boop you're all done
