0.69 1.75 B: (( hello )) 

1.07 2.73 A: (( hello hello )) 

2.46 3.29 B: hi 

3.97 5.42 A: my name's christie 

4.86 6.19 B: hi i'm cathy 

6.03 6.93 A: how are you 

6.64 7.68 B: i'm good 

7.77 8.74 A: [laughter] 

8.39 10.93 B: so what do you think about the airport security [laughter] 

11.35 12.62 A: [sigh] well 

13.78 20.67 A: i don't think it well it does a little bit more good than it used to but i still don't think it's it could be better 

20.61 27.13 B: right that's i feel the same way i don't i don't think there's too much we can do about terrorist attacks if they want to 

27.29 29.46 B: get in they'll figure out a way to do it 

29.19 30.61 A: yep i agree 

30.74 31.99 A: and 

30.77 34.42 B: [mn] tightened security might help like you said a little bit but 

34.60 36.41 A: yeah but it's not gonna 

36.88 39.22 A: if they wanna get in bad enough they will 

38.74 41.04 B: right [laughter] yes i feel the same way 

41.45 47.85 A: [mn] and i don't the new you have to leave your suitcase unlocked i mean that would be fine 

46.20 46.94 B: right 

47.95 53.02 A: as long as you could lock it again before it goes onto baggage or whatever but 

52.60 53.94 B: right i agree 

53.26 59.35 A: that just promotes more airport employees going through your stuff and taking whatever the hell they feel like it 

56.98 58.27 B: exactly 

58.79 60.17 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

59.95 61.22 A: [laughter] 

60.70 69.47 B: i agree i don't really travel that much so i don't i don't feel threatened by it myself because i'm really not a traveller but yep 

64.55 65.50 A: i don't either 

69.35 73.61 A: yeah i very rarely fly anywhere once or twice every you know 

74.03 75.93 A: two three years so 

75.08 78.95 B: yeah that's about me maybe every five or six years [laughter] even [laughter] 

78.31 81.39 A: yeah i really don't go very go anywhere 

81.75 87.48 A: i did however go of course like a month after the september eleventh happened [laughter] i went to las vegas but 

87.13 88.84 B: (( oh [laughter] did you feel safe )) 

87.79 89.80 A: (( but i was a little worried but )) 

89.83 93.32 B: did you feel safer though because they were checking things better 

93.20 95.27 A: i guess i mean 

93.33 93.93 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

95.81 97.87 A: how safe can you really feel though 

97.57 98.92 B: right [laughter] yeah 

98.32 99.96 A: (( you know [laughter] )) 

100.74 103.60 B: well that's what that's how i feel about it you know they can 

100.82 101.59 A: oh 

104.20 111.17 B: tighten security but you're still always you never know what's going to happen i mean you could walk down the street and get hit by a car [laughter] you know 

110.64 111.91 A: exactly 

112.62 117.39 A: yeah i don't think it's gonna i mean it's changed and all it's done is 

117.57 121.50 A: create a bigger hassle for the honest person trying to get on an airplane 

120.68 122.38 B: right i agree 

122.69 125.55 A: but again you look at other countries who 

125.98 131.30 A: their security has have always been really strict and they've always searched everything and and you know it 

131.31 133.55 A: they don't seem to have any problems 

133.34 134.08 B: right 

133.82 138.89 A: but they don't have the amount or the volume of people that we do travelling every day either 

138.09 139.60 B: that's true yeah 

140.72 142.40 A: [mn] kinda difficult [sigh] 

142.92 146.81 A: i mean it's tough for all the airlines too who are losing business because of it 

146.29 147.58 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

147.73 151.07 B: but the thing is people have to travel so you are always gonna 

151.13 152.38 B: have a lot of a 

152.75 155.98 B: lot of airplanes up there and a lot of chance for terrorists to 

156.18 158.69 B: like figure out some other way to get in you know 

158.60 159.53 A: right 

159.79 161.61 A: (( i'm sure they'll figure out a new way )) 

161.28 162.29 B: yes 

162.42 164.51 B: that's the scary part you never know 

162.70 163.56 A: (( you know )) 

164.93 169.20 B: [laughter] no matter what type of security they have you never know what's going to happen next so 

169.28 171.84 A: right and if you have enough money you can buy your own jet 

172.18 173.05 B: right 

172.52 173.94 A: and have your own 

174.09 177.84 A: you know flight crew and stuff and go fly that into a building 

177.26 178.56 B: yeah that's true 

177.99 180.33 A: who's gonna stop that you know 

179.11 179.94 B: right 

180.01 181.24 B: right 

180.60 184.10 A: because it it's a private plane they don't check you like you know 

184.19 185.25 B: yeah 

185.26 186.96 A: i don't think they do anyway 

186.60 192.37 B: yeah i don't think like the smaller airports probably don't have security that they do at the larger ones 

192.41 193.33 A: right 

194.14 195.44 A: (( and i think their )) 

195.68 197.36 A: their xray machines 

198.16 199.47 A: suck to begin with 

199.19 200.16 B: [laughter] 

199.65 203.32 A: i don't think that [laughter] you know i don't think that they really do a good enough job 

202.78 213.27 B: right well look at right after everything happened how many people were going through and they found out that you know they got through with knives and other things that they had and got through the system [laughter] 

212.99 216.99 A: right and i can't one guy hadn't he put dynamite or something in his shoe 

216.58 217.92 B: yeah yeah 

217.50 218.52 A: you know 

219.43 222.14 B: yeah we used to get around that i guess [laughter] 

222.46 225.90 A: [sigh] yeah unfortunately [sigh] well like you said 

226.11 230.25 A: luckily for both of us neither one of us fly very often so it's not that big of a deal [lipsmack] 

229.80 231.13 B: (( right well )) 

234.48 237.56 A: okay well how much time's left [laughter] 

236.52 244.53 B: i don't know that's what i was wondering is this thing or is there a time limit like does it automatically say okay your time is up [laughter] or do you just keep talking [laughter] 

242.94 244.09 A: i'm not sure 

244.42 246.19 A: this is the first one i've done 

245.76 249.50 B: i know this is the first one i've done too i think it said like ten minutes or something 

249.56 250.70 A: yeah 

251.30 255.05 B: but how much can you talk about the one subject for ten minutes [laughter] 

254.18 257.44 A: i know i don't have much more to say other than that [laughter] 

256.59 260.98 B: i don't how do you feel about it well we always say how we feel about it [laughter] [laughter] 

259.93 260.85 A: yeah 

261.10 261.66 B: (( uh )) 

262.88 264.47 A: i don't know it could be better 

264.73 265.89 B: yes i 

265.17 267.10 A: but then it's just gonna create 

267.21 272.56 A: longer lines and bigger hassles but in the long run it would be worth it if you know you're 

271.30 272.14 B: yeah 

272.93 273.86 A: you know 

274.16 277.59 A: not going to be flown into a building or die because of a terrorist 

277.26 278.16 B: (( right yeah )) 

277.91 278.81 A: you know 

280.35 281.66 A: it's worth the 

281.72 284.34 A: longer wait and the bigger hassle that it is 

283.69 284.91 B: that's true too 

286.41 293.60 B: every little bit helps you know if they can tighten security and you know save one plane then they did a good job so 

293.29 294.36 A: mhm 

293.97 295.87 B: you know it's worth it i guess 

294.71 295.45 A: (( yeah i don't )) 

299.21 299.79 A: (( know )) 

300.11 301.30 A: it would take a 

302.10 304.87 A: lot to coordinate something like they did i don't think that 

305.74 307.42 A: (( they would be able to do that again )) 

307.38 308.27 B: right 

308.12 309.99 A: you know take four planes 

310.94 313.21 A: you know at one time and 

312.66 313.51 B: right 

313.73 315.75 A: i mean yeah maybe one 

315.96 317.34 A: you know maybe two 

317.04 317.85 B: yeah 

317.71 320.07 A: but i don't think all at the same time that they 

320.09 322.19 A: (( would ever be able to pull that off again )) 

322.73 331.52 B: but that's the whole thing i don't think they'd ever try to do something the same as the same thing again they'd try it'd be something totally different like who would have ever even thought that you know 

328.98 330.49 A: (( oh right )) 

331.53 337.71 B: what happened could have happened that way you know ever- that's like something nobody even ever dreamed of 

337.47 338.41 A: right 

338.14 346.76 B: so there's probably something else that nobody even ever thought of that they're probably planning right now for ten years from now [laughter] we don't know 

345.47 346.44 A: yeah 

347.30 354.07 A: i'm sure i thought i thought they were i was at work when that happened and i thought somebody was joking when he came to my desk and like get out of here 

352.78 358.51 B: me too i know when we first started hearing about it at my job it was the same way everybody was like what you know and 

359.31 365.00 B: you know you were getting like little pieces of information at the beginning and everybody you know was like 

365.43 368.21 B: (( you know this is you've got to be kidding [laughter] yeah )) 

367.93 375.65 A: yeah i was somebody came up to my desk and told me and i'm like what you're joking right he was like no i'm like oh my god and we 

375.74 384.56 A: got a t._v. set together and i have a radio at my desk and i put it on and like then they said you know the pentagon and i was like oh my god it was just unbelievable [mn] 

384.11 385.27 B: (( it was mhm )) 

386.49 397.34 B: the first i heard about it at work they came in and just said a plane had hit the world trade centre the twin towers and we just thought it was an accident you know like oh wow that s awful you know a plane ran into the building 

394.51 395.48 A: right 

397.84 410.56 B: but then like ten minutes later somebody else called us and they said you know you are not going to believe this it's on the news another plane hit and then we started really talking about it and started you know listening to the radio and everything [mn] 

410.20 411.27 A: yeah 

411.45 412.46 B: (( terrible oh well )) 

415.67 419.00 A: (( yeah oh well hopefully it'll get better and )) 

421.42 425.71 A: you know nothing like that uh plane wise would happen again but like but 

425.76 426.73 A: (( who knows )) 

426.89 428.32 A: we probably have to 

428.72 429.65 A: you know 

430.22 438.29 A: be more secure in all the borders you know from here to canada from here to mexico you know not just airplane rides but 

439.28 443.22 A: you know border patrols and anybody can come into the united states 

440.73 441.53 B: right 

442.29 443.60 B: (( um hopefully not right )) 

444.71 445.70 B: (( right that's true )) 

447.62 451.56 A: [lipsmack] i think that's another reason we've made it too easy for people to get here 

451.37 452.18 B: yeah 

452.09 456.58 A: you know even to fly here from other countries you know if you have a visa or you have you know 

456.95 459.16 A: a green card or whatever you can get in 

458.79 459.97 B: [mn] right and the 

459.35 460.45 A: i don't 

460.35 464.80 B: people that get in stay here or they are here illegally and they're still here anyway for years 

460.54 461.44 A: i don't 

464.63 466.87 A: right i don't think it should be that way either 

466.31 467.48 B: no it shouldn't be 

466.88 467.55 A: i 

467.57 471.13 A: know america's the land of the free but i think we should be a little more uh 

472.19 474.45 A: tight on security and who we let in 

474.34 477.72 B: right well that's it especially now you know not knowing 

478.09 485.22 B: who's a terrorist and who's not you know you can't just let everybody in and say well we'll try to figure it out you know 

480.56 481.70 A: right 

488.78 489.38 A: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

493.00 496.08 A: i mean i guess they come back on and say when your time's up 

496.29 501.85 B: can't do it i guess i would think so [laughter] otherwise people could just talk for days [laughter] 

501.07 502.21 A: [laughter] 

503.31 505.36 A: (( i don't have much more to say though [laughter] )) 

504.55 512.07 B: it would be better if it was a subject that you had more to say about you know like this like there's really not too much more than you can say how you'd feel about it you know 

510.35 511.57 A: (( right well )) 

511.99 513.73 A: we've kinda covered it all 

513.81 515.15 B: yeah i think so 

515.87 519.12 A: i mean i don't know any ways to to make it better but 

520.37 521.15 B: (( right )) 

522.60 525.22 A: something somebody should come up with something [laughter] 

524.52 525.21 B: [laughter] 

528.31 531.71 B: uh we need some kind of like star trek laser things that they just like 

531.81 537.94 B: wave the wand over you and they can tell everything [laughter] inside out what you got you know [laughter] 

535.04 536.88 A: yeah [laughter] 

537.74 539.70 A: [laughter] some space age 

539.54 540.41 B: (( yeah you know )) 

540.42 541.21 A: thing 

542.91 543.93 B: something that's 

544.03 544.84 B: (( and thorough )) 

546.12 547.17 A: (( and )) 

547.35 554.27 A: what they'll let you have on a plane in your carry on is just ridiculous you can't have nail clippers come on now 

552.65 553.49 B: yeah 

554.03 556.10 B: that's true [laughter] 

555.27 558.51 A: (( what is somebody gonna do with a pair of nail clippers [laughter] )) 

558.97 559.65 A: (( come )) 

559.83 561.49 A: (( here and we'll cut your nails off )) 

561.07 563.71 B: yeah pull your toenails out one by one [laughter] 

563.37 566.08 A: [laughter] i mean scissors i can see 

565.87 567.41 B: right something that's sharp 

566.82 571.19 A: a little more dangerous not as obviously you know 

568.27 569.06 B: right 

571.31 574.24 A: you know put it on your check luggage if you have to take 

574.53 578.03 A: scissors or a knife i mean i usually typically carry scissors with me 

577.75 583.34 B: right you that's it you know you'd have like a bag with little things like that scissors nail file and things but 

579.40 580.25 A: you know 

583.39 588.53 A: right of course the scissors i have are the kind that just like clip trim my bangs or something you know 

588.07 588.93 B: (( yeah right )) 

588.56 592.36 A: they're not even sharp on the end so i mean they could be used as a deadly weapon but 

593.62 595.06 A: you know i think it's 

595.41 599.89 A: silly some of the stuff that they say you can't have on your carry on nowadays
