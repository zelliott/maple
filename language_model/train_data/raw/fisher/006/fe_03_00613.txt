312.80 317.55 A: i know these poor people they're going to listen to like they're supposed to talk about holidays and they're talking about pets 

317.78 320.29 A: but it's in relation to our holiday that we invented 

320.02 320.63 B: that is right 

321.66 324.11 A: so is our holiday just going to be called pet day 

323.62 324.01 B: yeah 

325.56 336.97 A: that works see watch now in a couple of months we're going to see they're going to have advertisements for pet day and we're going to be like they got it from our conversation we should get paid for it we invented it 

331.89 332.96 B: oh yeah 

337.06 338.97 B: i live in an apartment so the bird 

339.73 340.32 B: are at best 

340.66 342.69 B: they have cause there is no room 

342.98 343.94 A: oh definitely 

343.49 344.66 B: or a dog or a cat 

345.15 345.95 A: yeah 

345.46 345.76 B: cat 

345.95 346.32 B: i've not 

347.72 351.32 A: we actually just moved out of an apartment we had cats in the apartment and then 

351.42 353.82 A: we just moved and finally were able to get a dog 

354.58 356.17 A: so that was 

356.31 357.45 A: big excitement 

358.73 359.22 B: cat now 

361.02 364.60 A: yeah i don't know if that is a good combination but not that cats and dogs are either so 

364.36 366.12 B: well i think if you get them like 

366.45 367.27 B: cats when they're kittens 

368.27 368.80 A: yeah 

368.45 370.13 B: let them grow up around the bird 

371.21 375.87 A: yeah maybe they'd get used to it it wouldn't be like bringing an adult one in to think he's supposed to eat them 

377.55 378.33 B: cause i my 

378.53 379.85 B: my cockatiels are never 

380.29 381.52 B: there cage is never closed 

382.19 382.63 B: they have

398.69 399.47 A: sounds good 

400.09 400.45 A: huh 

401.52 404.34 A: yeah i've never ever had a bird or anything so i don't really know too much 

404.60 405.51 A: about them other than 

404.71 408.10 B: surprised they're being really quiet they're just like kids as soon as you get on 

408.40 410.20 B: someone gets on the phone they start 

410.68 412.60 B: squawking and making all kinds of noise 

413.99 415.59 A: that is funny 

417.30 420.76 A: so yeah so you said about christmas it's always cold there but

442.05 442.44 B: yeah 

443.14 446.37 A: i mean my options are pretty much new england which 

447.22 450.39 A: no matter where i go i'm either going to get a little less or a lot more
