53.96 54.94 B: right 

54.61 56.60 A: plan fro you you don't you don't know 

56.88 59.03 B: right and i think it's more time is just 

59.13 59.76 B: spending 

59.94 62.73 B: with your family and loved ones you know making that 

63.49 68.20 B: effort to spend more time because like you said you just don't know what's around the corner 

68.25 68.69 A: right 

69.15 72.93 A: and as so many people unfortunately found out they could be gone and 

73.03 78.28 A: you know you you leave things unsaid and undone and you live with regret for the rest of your life 

78.19 78.77 B: oh yes 

79.44 81.17 B: just think of these people who saw 

81.66 84.47 B: their spouses off to work that morning like any other day 

85.37 86.77 B: never to see them again 

86.65 87.54 A: exactly 

88.32 93.56 A: but really other than that i haven't made that many major changes in my life i mean i'm 

94.60 100.66 A: i always believe in being prepared for the worst you know you hope for the best but you always prepare for the worst and 

98.78 99.61 B: right 

100.18 100.64 B: right 

100.77 102.11 A: and so that's a pretty 

102.62 103.77 A: steady in my life 

104.02 104.75 B: yes 

105.09 105.92 B: i'm the same 

106.55 107.14 B: and i just 

107.43 109.62 B: you know and since then 

110.51 112.21 B: just the way things have been 

112.97 115.05 B: it just makes you think 

115.52 116.57 B: it can happen again 

116.96 120.38 A: oh i absolutely believe it will it's just a matter of time 

119.82 122.74 B: right and i think it's going to catch us when you know 

122.86 125.35 B: in the wake of the september eleventh i think everybody was 

125.52 127.48 B: extra cautious and everything 

127.94 128.70 B: the media 

128.99 132.20 B: you know made us be that way and hyped it up more nut 

131.31 131.78 A: right 

132.59 134.41 B: now i think too people 

134.77 136.42 B: are starting to relax a little more and 

136.55 137.38 B: i i see the 

138.02 141.33 B: it'll be boom again when we're all relaxed and not expecting it 

141.00 147.27 A: i absolutely agree with that too boy do did they match us up by how we believe or what 

144.82 146.38 B: yeah really 

147.35 148.30 B: so it's um 

148.71 150.35 B: i don't know what else to think about it 

150.79 152.02 B: you know and 

153.42 158.85 B: with what's going on now with the talk of korea and iraq it's like oh please we don't need another war 

158.26 160.65 A: no we don't you're absolutely right 

159.49 161.05 B: and i think sometimes (( is that )) 

161.46 162.67 B: somehow related to 

163.05 164.47 B: back to september eleventh 

165.26 165.93 A: in what way 

166.69 169.09 B: i don't know i mean now they're thinking maybe 

169.78 172.16 B: you know saddam has got some people who are 

172.79 175.49 B: in his network that are part of the al qaeda qaeda 

176.24 177.84 B: association i don't know 

177.03 177.58 A: well it 

177.91 179.35 A: that's entirely possible 

179.55 179.99 A: um 

179.59 180.44 B: you know but 

180.68 181.73 B: the whole thing 

182.82 187.46 B: i don't think it's just iraq and korea korea i think you've got to look at the whole world i mean 

188.70 190.71 B: if he's got people everywhere 

190.80 192.64 B: you know i think we need to help 

192.81 194.73 B: i don't think america can do it on its own 

194.71 197.98 A: oh i agree with you there america might think it can but 

195.80 196.51 B: i think he needs 

197.82 198.40 B: right 

198.11 199.52 A: we really can't 

199.13 201.11 B: no i think he needs the support of 

201.81 202.65 B: everybody 

202.60 203.70 A: everybody 

202.81 205.15 B: yo know if you want to crack down on terrorism 

206.35 214.07 A: yeah because unless you get cooperation from all the other nations then it's not going to do any good for just a few nations they'll just go to the other nations 

214.07 214.65 B: right 

214.65 215.61 A: that protect them 

220.05 222.84 B: but i feel that you know after initially afterwards 

222.94 223.41 B: when 

223.77 228.63 B: president bush was saying that you know oh he was going for war and eye for eye and all this 

229.16 230.84 B: i could see that in the heat of the moment 

231.52 233.48 B: you know initially after the attack but 

233.23 233.62 A: right 

233.95 234.83 B: it's like 

236.17 238.00 B: what's that going to solve 

244.19 245.73 A: you're not going to get an eye for an eye 

245.96 246.45 B: right 

246.58 249.04 A: somebody else is going to have to take the heat for it 

249.11 249.79 B: right 

249.54 254.72 A: be it a country or uh an individual cell or you know however you want to break it down 

254.70 255.19 B: right 

255.63 258.65 B: and i think even i don't think he's ever going to capture saddam 

258.72 260.28 A: oh no i don't think so either 

259.74 262.57 B: you know that's a lost cause right there 

262.43 264.63 A: no he's he's well prepared 

264.51 269.01 B: yeah he's ten steps ahead of us we're too we're too involved with the bureaucracy and 

266.12 266.62 A: yes 

269.71 270.46 B: political 

270.85 273.09 B: outcome and being politically correct 

272.87 273.86 A: exactly 

273.76 274.39 B: um 

274.54 275.09 B: i hate 

277.01 277.33 B: oh 

278.05 278.35 B: oh 

279.86 281.02 B: i know right 

280.46 287.00 A: uh saddam definitely monitors those channels so he like you said ten steps ahead of us 

284.89 285.56 B: oh yeah 

286.86 287.41 B: yeah 

287.86 289.62 B: same with and i think too in the future 

289.82 294.52 B: you know you've got so many pe- syria is too it sounded like he's got so many people who are willing to 

294.65 296.08 B: do these suicide bombings 

296.76 297.33 B: you know 

297.40 298.80 A: right uh ah yes 

297.99 301.92 B: ha i mean getting him you've got somebody who is ready to step right into his shoes 

302.08 302.51 A: right 

302.82 304.08 A: you're absolutely right 

304.05 304.54 B: scary 

305.31 307.51 B: but i don't know how it's all going to end 

308.62 311.05 B: i mean i don't see an end in sight any time soon 

311.02 313.65 A: well i don't either especially if we go to war with iraq 

313.78 315.01 A: i think that will really 

313.87 315.66 B: uh-huh see that's going to open up a whole 

316.32 319.14 A: whole other can of worms because that will uh 

317.59 318.60 B: oh yes 

319.38 327.04 A: really tick off some other nations like iran and korea and you know that's all we need is another world war 

327.75 330.11 B: and what will that solve if we do go to war 

330.24 330.96 A: not a thing 

331.14 334.53 B: no there'll be retaliation for that and then it's an on-going thing 

331.15 332.26 A: because like you said 

334.98 335.41 A: when 

335.00 337.74 B: the whole thing is they haven't learned from previous wars 

338.07 340.78 A: well i i don't understand why they haven't either but 

341.21 346.60 A: apparently they haven't they think that the show of force is the way to handle everything and i i don't agree with that 

346.85 348.42 B: no neither do i i think just 

349.00 350.73 B: you know showing your military might and 

353.20 355.89 B: i mean one thing about clinton at least he kept them all talking 

357.44 357.95 B: you know 

358.00 358.51 A: yeah 

358.87 361.10 B: you know whereas bush seems to be 

361.32 363.32 B: so gung ho on a war with somebody 

363.76 364.61 B: if it's not going to 

365.08 366.70 B: i mean the funny thing is he's got 

366.82 369.35 B: troops in afghanistan and now he's sending them off out to 

370.45 371.28 B: iraq and 

371.57 372.41 B: other places it 

372.58 372.84 B: like 

373.66 374.14 B: (( )) 

374.32 374.80 B: you know 

374.88 375.30 A: yeah 

375.41 375.80 A: and 

375.96 382.27 A: the the military is going to run out of forces soon because you can't spread them that thin and expect them to do the job that they're supposed to do 

381.33 382.11 B: right 

382.32 383.02 B: exactly 

383.08 385.28 A: which maybe is what our enemies are counting on 

385.46 385.99 B: right 

387.90 388.90 B: so i don't know how 

389.84 391.58 B: i don't know where we go from here 

391.96 396.32 A: i'm not sure either but uh i'm pretty sure that we're going to go to war with iraq 

397.46 400.02 A: at least it seems that way from everything that's happening 

401.04 404.10 B: then iraq starts and then korea will be in on something else 

404.66 408.80 B: but he hasn't actually threatened us or anything so why i don't understand why 

404.69 405.28 A: well 

409.06 410.54 B: he's so go- gung ho on it 

411.21 413.25 A: well he seems to think that they have the 

413.41 416.37 A: the capabilities of doing massive damage 

416.54 416.86 A: with 

417.70 424.83 A: weapons of nucl- uh of massive destruction be it uh germ warfare or you know stuff like that and uh 

420.25 420.58 B: right 

425.33 430.14 A: i have no doubt that he has them and he would use them i mean he did to his own people the kurds 

430.86 434.15 A: and so american people wouldn't mean anything to him they would 

434.03 434.44 B: right 

434.36 435.55 A: celebrate that but 

436.51 437.66 A: i don't know 

438.23 443.89 A: and if we do go to war i think israel will pay the biggest price because they're in hitting range 

444.16 444.64 B: right 

445.78 450.03 A: which uh would not eh oh gosh that would just drag another nation in 

450.03 450.98 B: and just make it 

451.23 452.32 A: that much worse 

452.36 452.87 B: right 

454.64 456.23 B: i mean sometimes i think 

456.65 457.21 B: um 

458.02 458.38 B: huh 

458.61 459.90 B: will the middle east ever 

460.29 461.32 B: will we ever solve our 

461.76 464.97 B: our difference with the middle east or is that just going to be 

465.49 466.68 B: always an on-going 

467.45 467.84 B: fair 

468.16 477.27 A: well it has been for thousands of years i don't see that uh you know this president is going to do anything different than any other president has tried to do and it's never solved it so 

477.38 477.94 B: right 

477.99 480.45 A: i don't see a war solving it that's for sure 

482.40 483.74 A: no absolutely not 

484.15 486.25 B: how long do we're fighting with iran for and 

487.56 488.62 B: are we any better 

488.50 489.51 A: no not at all 

489.05 489.42 B: no 

490.07 491.71 B: same with the september eleventh thing 

492.33 493.28 B: you know that blew 

493.49 496.67 B: that'll come around again i hate sounding pessimistic but 

497.05 501.72 A: well i agree with you a hundred there like i said it's just a matter of time and i think 

502.74 505.88 A: what would escalate it would be for us to start a war over there 

506.10 511.00 A: i think that would give them more reason to have their suicide bombers 

509.62 514.68 B: and i think by starting the war maybe we're playing into saddam's or not saddam's but um 

515.21 515.85 A: al qaeda's 

515.96 517.94 B: uh right hands right there 

516.15 516.71 A: hands 

517.65 519.38 A: i can't think of his name either 

518.99 519.43 B: i know 

519.54 522.38 B: he is so off on that one it's just gone form me 

519.63 521.00 A: uh bin laden 

522.33 523.63 A: bin laden that's it 

523.20 523.71 B: right 

524.38 525.22 A: yup you're 

524.79 526.21 B: playing right into his hands 

525.99 526.39 A: yup 

526.96 528.43 B: and i think that's what he wants 

527.20 527.55 A: and 

528.56 535.23 A: well yes and then if we're all preoccupied with the war and our military is over there fighting the war that kind of leaves us pretty vulnerable here 

535.54 537.63 B: right that was my thought when he said that 

538.04 539.96 B: and that's when something is going to strike again 

540.08 540.60 A: right 

540.56 542.68 B: everybody is going to be focused on the war with 

542.86 543.53 B: saddam and 

543.73 544.23 B: boom 

544.68 545.04 A: yup 

545.33 546.26 B: we get it again 

546.36 547.57 A: and you're right 

547.98 550.80 A: and i've noticed a lot of people getting 

551.08 555.07 A: kind of the way they were before september eleventh you know just uh 

555.84 559.05 A: um i won't say lackadaisical but 

559.93 560.70 A: they forget 

560.96 561.34 A: what
