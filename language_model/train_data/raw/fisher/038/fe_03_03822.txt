174.08 174.84 A: (( oh wow )) 

175.57 176.97 A: (( [laughter] mhm definitely ))

177.42 178.62 A: wow 

178.23 185.95 B: but um movies i i do remember i suppose it was more taken to the movies and ah 

186.42 191.43 B: [mn] you could imagine how long ago this was it was when mary poppins was first out 

191.31 195.38 B: and i remember taking my oldest i think he was about 

195.26 203.53 B: i think he was five four and a half and we got up to the kiosk to pay our money and they said oh sorry we're full 

203.40 210.00 B: because yeah so he he was crying of course and then i'm thinking afterwards well 

203.51 204.79 A: oh no 

209.87 219.35 B: maybe it's just as well because maybe we would have been sitting right up the front and getting a back or something because all the good seats will be gone 

219.36 222.13 B: but ah that stands out in my memory 

222.35 226.94 B: and ah i i don't envy the young parents nowadays i really don't 

227.35 238.42 A: it's very difficult you have to be really careful ah ah and censor the things that you let through your television or you know even cartoons these days we don't let our kids watch even a lot of um the 

238.35 246.17 A: the- there's things the cartoons that are supposed to be funny you know are not always funny you know what i mean they're sometimes dirty so you have to be real careful 

243.42 244.60 B: yes 

246.26 251.29 A: about those kind of um shows comedy movies it doesn't matter you know 

250.30 265.22 B: yeah yes i i do remember sometimes um well this is more in the playground they ask you very awkward questions sometimes and um okay you want to be fairly open but they're knot ready for a lot of things 

265.16 271.80 B: so sometimes you know it was annoying to think that you know that they you have to confront this 

268.55 269.22 A: (( [laughter] )) 

272.01 275.71 B: and ah that i do remember but ah 

274.53 275.66 A: mhm 

275.77 277.38 B: it's um 

277.42 279.65 B: so do you have little boys or are 

279.15 282.07 A: just one little boy mhm and the other two are girls 

282.21 283.94 B: are the girls the oldest 

283.67 287.19 A: uh one of yes the girl's oldest and then the boy and then another girl 

286.77 288.97 B: so she's mother's helper 

288.86 292.37 A: correct yeah yeah when she wants to be 

289.45 291.03 B: [laughter] 

291.96 301.49 B: oh for mine i had the boy first then the girl and of course it was a dead opposite he didn't want anything to do with her not till she got a little bit older 

301.01 302.43 A: oh wow 

301.75 316.69 B: and if there was nobody else about he'd bring out some you know those little matchbox cars and he'd ask her whi- which car would you like to play with [mn] so i mean that was great you know i don't know i suppose you'd call it bonding now but in my time it was 

316.58 318.74 B: harmony and peace and quiet 

318.68 331.62 B: so that was good but ah like i say i i really i don't envy the parents now what about this um i remember president clinton was talking about some b. chip is is that actually 

331.84 333.93 B: (( there now on the t._v.s now )) 

333.83 336.00 A: uh i think it is not in 

335.94 349.41 A: [mn] i think you might have to order it we don't have it on ours but you can censor that it will show at the top of the screen and even now they have it on programs it will say um t. for teams or g. or whatever on every program that comes on 

349.29 354.20 A: so you can use that but that b. chip i i think you have to order that i'm not really sure 

353.94 355.67 B: oh so that works 

354.36 355.67 A: how that works 

356.04 367.23 B: in into an expense for you i mean it's hard enough you know just getting by day to day without you know paying for extra things well 

363.80 365.58 A: exactly without those 

366.63 367.78 A: yeah 

368.21 372.52 B: i i know we got a computer and it's so annoying do you have a computer 

372.27 373.45 A: yes uh-huh 

372.99 379.15 B: (( okay i mean we're stuffed at this ban that we're getting and sometimes )) 

379.20 381.04 B: um okay 

381.19 392.00 B: say if you had a teenager i mean you don't have this problem yet but if you've got a teenager you all this stuff coming on i said to my husband i'm i 

391.99 405.27 B: glad i'm old [laughter] and i'm passed all that but ah also i think um the some of the late night shows getting back more to the subject at hand the late night shows are 

393.25 394.85 A: [laughter] 

402.15 403.17 A: [laughter] 

405.41 408.15 B: (( [mn] some of the things are really shocking )) 

407.98 413.25 A: oh certainly they are they're shocking for me i'm young [laughter] they're very shocking 

410.97 412.32 B: i know 

412.86 415.80 B: i know and i don't understand why 

415.93 423.98 B: okay uh we get jerry springer down here at nine o'clock and i was at the doctor's office this is about a month ago 

423.84 431.65 B: and whatever program was on before was like a local channel like local events and you know fairly interesting 

431.54 443.02 B: and then the jerry springer show came on so the young lady behind the receptionist she came out and she said oh that's it and you know how awful it is you're waiting there for your turn you know 

442.76 443.71 A: mhm 

443.00 443.90 B: (( ah )) 

443.86 458.28 B: time seems to drag and you wonder what you know what your problem is so i suppose in a way it's distracting but she says no none of this so i suppose uh somebody complained or their doctor said hey this isn't appropriate 

458.23 463.97 B: but if nothing else [laughter] he took him by you're so shocked at some of the things that go on 

463.82 464.80 A: right 

464.36 465.56 B: (( but ah )) 

464.84 475.69 A: exactly and the even the the comedy shows that you know were once okay to watch that have been on for several years you know that that they're running them over and over and over 

475.58 481.89 A: are new shows i guess are being produced but by the same show you know after like the fifth season they have to start 

481.83 483.93 A: getting a little bit just 

483.78 486.56 A: you know disgusting and and dirty and saying 

486.36 501.36 A: foul language now they can let those you know curse words on the television but at one time it used to be nice to watch it but because they have to go with the times now they've turned and that comedy show is no longer appropriate to watch i think you know and that's a sad thing because at one time it used to be good 

501.17 510.66 B: yeah that that is a shame it deteriorates i know exactly what you mean and you know when you watch the movies on the t._v. and you get sometimes 

504.63 505.99 A: definitely 

506.16 507.19 A: mhm 

510.69 520.74 B: a very good story and you know you're enjoying the movie and all of a sudden they throw in a scene that is not related to the uh scene 

520.39 521.61 A: exactly 

520.95 533.32 B: not related to the storyline and then ah sometimes they'll bleep out the words [laughter] i suppose i sometimes will say oh gee i think that was whatever 

527.51 528.31 A: mhm 

533.12 534.91 A: [laughter] 

533.91 546.28 B: now this is one luxury when the kids are are gone you know you you can you don't have to watch absolutely every word you say because believe me they hear things i mean things you know 

546.41 556.47 B: not so much talking about that thing but they do pay attention and sometimes you know they can ask you things that kind of put you on the spot 

550.94 551.95 A: mhm 

556.46 561.48 B: so um i don't think that well i believe [sigh] 

561.77 563.56 B: it's all about money 

563.29 564.26 A: mhm 

563.83 565.37 B: you know these ah 

565.80 568.75 B: they could do better shows they 

567.90 573.77 A: yeah they could it's all about ratings and what the people want to see and a lot of people want to see junk you know 

573.47 581.30 B: yes i you know i don't know you're not my generation but my favorite the tonight show with johnny carson 

580.69 582.30 A: oh right mhm 

581.97 594.92 B: so i don't know you know if you ever watched it when he was the the m._c. or or whatever but ah what i liked about that so much he was very funny he was never vulgar 

594.94 599.44 B: and sometimes much as i like jay leno if i'm still awake when it's on 

599.23 599.89 A: [laughter]
