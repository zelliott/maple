14.33 16.13 A: yeah 

15.74 17.24 B: ah long way 

17.30 19.23 A: yeah [laughter] yeah it is 

18.74 21.21 B: yeah okay well hey i guess 

20.13 29.02 A: now this i guess w- w- when they said bad taste i guess isn't that kind of depending on who's doing the listening 

28.75 36.54 B: [lipsmack] mm yeah i think think you're probably right uh what might be bad taste to you may not to me and vice versa right 

35.48 44.01 A: right that's that's why i'm i'm a little a little hesitant hesitant about about uh espousing what bad taste is because 

44.46 45.62 A: i i think 

45.70 57.27 A: i i think there's a a lot of it but but i've talked to other people who've said wasn't that really funny and and uh and so it's got me to to be concerned about what what do you think bad taste is 

57.28 62.59 B: [cough] well i i'm sure it probably relates on to some degree you know the environment we were brought up in 

63.02 67.47 B: [sigh] and uh you know bad taste i guess uh for me is when it uh 

68.07 70.63 B: (( i i you know it's )) 

71.58 76.97 B: they bad language and uh suggesti- suggestions when 

77.04 80.40 B: [sigh] you know it goes to extremes uh 

80.56 87.06 B: for example south park uh you know some of those t._v. comedies now the cart- the cartoon t._v. comedies 

87.25 89.58 B: with supposedly adult comedy 

89.58 90.54 A: yeah 

89.96 93.14 B: you know get really really some of them get really raw 

92.90 101.09 A: well i don't think south park is funny [laughter] funny even [mn] at all i mean i i never i well i shouldn't say that i've only seen about a half a show once and uh 

95.75 96.83 B: (( yeah )) 

101.15 104.55 A: and didn't understand why it was so popular but uh 

103.65 107.39 B: yeah well i haven't watched it that much but i know they do get in 

107.56 110.44 B: to subjects that are pretty raw sometimes 

110.45 125.20 A: i and i'm also surpri- i'm i'm sixty two and i'm surprised that what goes as acceptable language now when i was younger you wouldn't even think about saying some of that stuff 

125.79 130.86 B: yeah i think you're right i'm sixty six [lipsmack] so it sounds like they matched us up fairly well 

130.05 133.44 A: [laughter] yeah i guess so uh 

132.63 134.78 B: (( uh a- and i )) 

133.52 145.31 A: yep because i mean i'm i have i have two grandsons and and [mn] it isn't that they say bad things it's just that some of the things that they say i mean i can remember when i was in um 

145.62 151.33 A: in music class and i was asked to bring some music to records to to listen to 

151.39 165.70 A: and o- one of the songs somebody said damn in it and i knew that and so i told the teacher and she stopped playing it right then uh and and now y y [mn] people wouldn't even think of of even 

165.79 168.13 A: mentioning it i don't think 

167.59 169.42 B: yeah i i think you're 

169.57 175.35 B: you're totally right and you know a lot of the rap the rap music uh of course that's not comedy but uh 

175.86 178.28 B: [lipsmack] you know is [cough] the same way 

178.31 181.34 A: oh yeah i don't unders- yeah i i just don't 

181.65 192.98 A: understand 'cause to me i i you know i guess i'm it's my age but when i hear rap music it just it all sounds like it's the same beat just different words exactly and i i 

193.28 196.31 A: some of them are really awful [laughter] i think 

196.23 200.88 B: well do you do you think comedy you know we're talking about whether comedy's in bad taste or not [sigh] 

200.90 201.99 B: um 

202.67 211.54 B: it is generational and you know what like you say what's acceptable to us in the generation we grew up in now our children 

211.67 215.66 B: grew up in a little bit different generation and especially our grandchildren 

215.27 216.29 A: yeah 

215.69 221.90 B: as you pointed out are growing up in a totally different well in fact the generation the t._v. generation of today 

222.06 225.87 B: and uh they you know it seems that it 

226.18 227.72 B: it's trying to 

228.50 230.58 B: do whatever they can to shock you 

231.30 232.60 A: yeah i well i 

232.62 239.28 A: speaking of shy i remembered when george carwin with what his five or seven words that you couldn't use on 

239.62 247.34 A: on uh say out loud in some places and and now you can turn on television and hear almost almost all of them anywhere 

242.46 243.53 B: right 

246.31 250.46 B: yeah true yeah we've got a problem and nobody thinks anything about it right 

249.00 249.56 A: (( [cough] )) 

249.83 250.82 A: no 

251.00 252.79 B: yeah 

251.12 256.36 A: no so i think when when they say bad taste i- i- it it uh 

256.43 259.02 A: i can i can imagine if two 

259.19 264.91 A: thirty year olds or twenty year olds were talking about about this right now they would think probably uh 

265.93 267.74 A: maybe south park was great 

267.98 272.19 A: j- and just like eddie murphy i i i never never 

273.01 276.28 A: thought he was all that terrifically funny 

275.66 280.72 B: yeah have you gone to any of this um the standup comedy clubs 

277.12 278.59 A: and and a- 

280.65 281.67 A: uh-huh 

281.91 289.55 B: and [mn] and i i've seen a few of 'em i've not been to any live but i've seen a number of 'em on [sigh] cable [sigh] 

290.00 296.53 B: and uh you know some of those are funny and and some aren't i guess so the same um that's from my point of view so 

296.50 307.09 A: well what i what i find interesting is that you know a lot people think that some of the [mn] language and everything is not but you all go back it it the same people like in [mn] you go back and listen to [sigh] 

306.94 321.38 A: old bill cosby standup or old uh bob newhope standup and they'll think they're funny too and and [mn] i find that interesting because i think those were were very funny stand-ups but it some of the stuff today 

321.29 326.97 A: although it it some of it is good some of it is just downright oh 

327.81 334.38 A: i guess to me unfunny i i and i [laughter] and i find that interesting that they're listed as comedians 

330.74 332.39 B: right 

335.27 341.22 B: yeah well i i g you know getting back to you know what is acceptable um 

341.51 347.29 B: probably you look at different parts of the country and you're going to find variations too right 

346.12 351.11 A: oh yeah i guess i didn't think about that i guess that would be true that would be true 

349.71 355.18 B: i mean what might be acceptable in uh louisiana might not be acceptable in new york city or 

355.42 361.89 A: yeah well i i [cough] i lived in the detroit area for a while and and you'd always hear a lot of 

362.12 362.95 A: of 

363.23 371.57 A: jokes about people who lived in hamtrammick and and and it was also funny up there you'd you hear a lot of texas aggie jokes 

371.20 372.39 B: mhm 

371.58 375.20 A: i imagine that wouldn't those might not be funny to you [laughter] 

374.22 383.61 B: [lipsmack] well they wouldn't bother me 'cause i'm not from texas so [laughter] [laughter] but uh yeah that probably with a lot of texans down here they might not be funny but uh [lipsmack] 

376.78 378.58 A: oh [laughter] 

383.97 393.13 B: you know it it it is a shame though we're talking about acceptable humor that uh there are so many what used to be acceptable as ethnic humor today 

393.37 399.35 B: you know is almost verboten i mean you know we had polack jokes and uh 

396.17 397.22 A: yeah 

399.44 407.43 B: you know italian jokes and you know different jokes and and nobody really even if you're an italian or a polack you didn't particularly take offence to them 

406.82 412.87 A: well yeah that's what that's what i find interesting [mn] i was just just think exactly what you said uh i i know knew 

412.82 426.95 A: i lived in omaha and there were a lot of polish people that i knew that lived there and you'd say a joke and they'd laugh probably harder than than some of the other people and and it didn't bother 'em they didn't think any- they didn't think they didn't take it personally they didn't think uh they thought it was just a joke 

419.06 422.53 B: they'd laugh yeah they'd laugh with you yeah 

422.72 423.91 B: yeah 

426.64 438.75 B: yeah that's true today you you know you don't dare uh i mean everything has got to be politically correct and you know you say a lit- something that can be interpreted some other way and that's the way it's interpreted by that group so 

427.40 428.76 A: and uh 

432.17 433.34 A: oh 

438.45 440.37 A: y- yep 

439.32 443.14 B: it's it's kind of a shame that we've gotten to that but 

442.56 447.54 A: oh i i i do think that i've heard for some reason i've heard several 

447.66 460.55 A: blonde jokes lately and i have a few people that i know who are blonde and they think they're funny [laughter] but you [laughter] they [mn] you know they they just accept them and and and i find that 

453.00 455.09 B: yeah well 

460.43 469.29 A: [cough] disheartening that what you just said a- that in america we we seem to w- want to be more politically correct than honest 

468.70 474.82 B: yeah i think you're right well i [sigh] one of the things i do part time is i teach at a local college and uh 

474.97 478.47 B: as can teach teach continuing education for adults 

478.32 479.27 A: mhm 

478.62 481.66 B: and uh it's software computer software 

481.49 482.47 A: oh 

481.56 483.96 B: and i used to for 

483.83 491.51 B: oh i haven't done it a couple of years now but i used to tell jokes in class and you know blonde jokes we'd have jokes of the day and all that sort of thing 

490.81 491.87 A: mhm 

491.37 504.94 B: and we had a really good time and uh i've because of all the controversy over different jokes i finally stopped because i though well one of these days somebody's going to not like one of the jokes even though i've tried to [sigh] you know i always 

504.72 517.40 B: made sure i didn't talk about anything sexual or [sigh] or anything controversial or anything like that and uh it it was getting very hard to do [laughter] because somebody's always got something that's controversial [sigh] 

513.90 515.43 A: yeah so y- 

516.77 524.17 A: so you actually had to or felt that you had to stop saying [mn] making these jokes because of uh 

523.17 528.32 B: well well nobody told me to i just on my own decided that uh 

525.07 526.16 A: right 

528.42 535.46 B: and i'd heard a couple of situations where people got into trouble for saying something they shouldn't have said well you know look at all of our uh 

535.47 540.38 B: politicians every once in a while one of them gets up and makes some constant personal comment [sigh] 

540.52 544.88 B: that uh you know is is not politically correct 

545.19 548.81 B: and uh you know they they're lambasted pretty good for it [laughter] 

548.86 551.27 A: yeah what you just said you just said that that 

551.27 565.71 A: s- you heard you heard some people getting into trouble for things they shouldn't have said but but is it that they shouldn't have said it or that that uh people didn't want to take it in the in the vein that it was intended 

565.33 570.11 B: yeah i i that's i- it i'm sure and i i'm sure people are more much more sensitive 

570.15 575.12 B: you know because we're hearing about that from every you know newspaper story or television [sigh] 

575.18 577.37 B: uh you know the um [lipsmack] 

577.96 591.76 B: the profiling that the police uh do and you know to me it seems that profiling the reason we started in the first place [sigh] is it helped us capture you profiled a criminal [sigh] and if you happened to fit this profile i'm sorry but uh [sigh] 

580.22 581.51 A: oh y- 

587.90 588.76 A: right 

591.82 599.90 B: you know some it's been shown that seventy eighty percent of people in that you know if you stop somebody you're more likely to stop somebody that's committed a crime so [laughter] 

599.37 599.90 A: right
