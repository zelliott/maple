11.80 12.53 B: oh 

12.35 22.64 A: i don't know how to i've never done this before so i don't exactly know how to do this except we're supposed to 'bout talk about comedy and where we draw the line between good humor and bad humor 

22.11 23.10 B: right 

22.78 26.56 A: and [mn] and i don't know what your thoughts are on the whole thing but 

26.05 29.56 B: is this the first time you've ever participated in one of these me too 

27.70 40.60 A: yes it is okay um i don't know what to say except sometimes i find myself out with a group of people and they will tell an off colored joke or whatever and i'm sort of forced to 

41.42 46.78 A: go along with what's going on even though i kind of find it not in the best of taste 

46.50 48.08 B: [mn] um 

48.49 53.11 B: yeah a lot of people do that i um myself 

53.20 65.09 B: ah unless it's in like i just had this situation where i was at work and i've now no longer working but it wasn't because of i had i felt that i had to sit there and not say anything 

64.94 69.13 B: because of [sigh] the views and um 

69.48 70.80 B: (( [lipsmack] and )) 

71.20 75.05 B: um type of humor that these people were comfortable with 

75.19 78.93 B: and once i had said something in ah 

79.32 92.09 B: in response to it um just to let them know how uncomfortable i was and boy did i get a [laughter] so i don't generally sit moot unless it means my job 

84.51 85.28 A: mhm 

86.16 87.07 A: (( mm )) 

92.14 96.24 A: mm it's really hard for me i my views 

92.73 93.79 B: yeah 

96.50 101.15 A: have changed over the years in what's funny and what isn't 

100.71 101.91 B: mhm 

101.21 109.94 A: and i think the older i get the more refined my response to comedy is um my children are 

109.95 110.99 A: um 

110.95 119.13 A: very proper around me i don't know how they what their comedy is around other things i also find now that on the internet 

119.07 127.05 A: sometimes i get some really objectionable comedy that other members thinks really funny but i'm not too thrilled with 

127.18 129.41 B: mhm yeah 

127.82 130.97 A: you know so it makes it kinda hard to know what to do 

130.80 141.28 B: well it makes it difficult and i i mean the inform- i mean the internet is the information age and it flies at us from every different direction 

141.28 155.11 B: and sometimes when you're when you get on these you get this spam or this unsolicited email and it's that sort of stuff sometimes it's the worst sort of thing you can do is unsubscribe because then you've identified 

150.97 151.75 A: mhm 

155.13 163.63 B: yourself as a um as a valid email address so it does make it very difficult to stay out of the way of objectionable 

157.34 159.16 A: (( mhm )) 

164.42 169.73 B: information and material so i kn- i know that it's very difficult [lipsmack] um 

170.15 176.42 B: where i draw the line i think that's what we're supposed to be talking about is um [mn] i think it kind of 

173.18 174.00 A: mhm 

176.53 180.19 B: [noise] it it kind of has to do with what's politically correct 

180.88 181.82 A: (( mhm )) 

180.97 187.51 B: i think that's where most of us are kind of going with that because that's widely discussed in the media 

187.19 191.35 A: mhm i you know sometimes i find things 

191.49 193.98 A: funny and at other times i don't 

194.53 198.98 A: and i think maybe sometimes it depends on the situation and who's in the room 

198.67 199.75 B: (( mm )) 

200.02 201.03 A: um 

200.50 206.23 B: so women can make candid remarks about women as long as it's not men making candid remarks about women [laughter] 

205.17 215.12 A: [laughter] yeah what we find funny as women is not what we find funny coming from men exactly i agree what's going and then the other thing 

211.66 213.37 B: right [laughter] mhm 

215.56 219.51 A: i have found o- over this thing is um 

219.91 223.11 A: my dad is very um 

223.50 225.34 A: judgmental of everybody 

223.71 224.33 B: (( mhm mm )) 

225.35 238.76 A: so i swore that i was never going to be that way and i tried to raise my kids with open minds and all that kind of stuff and i come from a very racially biased area 

238.99 246.76 A: and um i find sometimes our humor is entirely objectionable to me 

247.03 250.52 A: you know and so it it makes it really hard 

251.03 257.10 A: i want i i find myself more as i get older saying you know i don't find that funny 

256.75 257.75 B: mhm 

257.89 263.65 A: i you know and maybe it's age maybe with age you get more about what 

264.01 265.19 A: you're doing [laughter] 

264.04 278.27 B: yeah well as as the younger you are your peers are more important and you want to fit in whereas the older you are it becomes i feel that you become less it it becomes less it's less important to necessarily fit in mhm 

278.62 293.56 A: yeah and and i think comedy is situational too like jay leno or someone like that when they do comedy i find often times it offends me and i don't watch those shows any more because they do offend me 

293.78 296.02 A: their humor is 

296.16 301.90 A: sometimes sick sometimes um prejudicial and 

302.63 306.30 A: i don't appreciate the humor i don't know how you feel about it 

305.64 315.76 B: well part of i think what's going on the majority the audience the major- who the majority audience is and i think i don't know how old you are i'm in my 

315.73 322.48 B: ah early forties and i think the older we are the less we fit in to the majority mm 

322.67 329.57 A: i agree and i'm fifty six so i'm really going down the other end but um yeah and it's so funny um 

329.96 330.91 A: um 

331.42 333.46 A: i find my 

334.06 345.25 A: the younger people these days um have more of a um i don't know how to say it rank sense of humor what they think is is truly funny 

345.44 346.36 A: just 

346.61 348.54 A: totally offends me 

348.67 353.30 A: and maybe i shouldn't feel that way maybe it's age coming in to it i don't even really know 

353.38 359.87 B: mhm i think it's i i think a lot of it is age because when you think about who they're who people are selling 

359.88 363.03 B: who advertising is is pointed to who 

363.07 375.82 B: you know um what that what the target audience is i think it's younger than we are and therefore they have to target that and i think that's a large part of this because [sigh] 

368.37 369.23 A: (( mhm )) 

376.30 388.17 B: some of the things i've i've heard that jay leno and um david letterman and things like that things people like that things that they say and conan o'brien is the absolute worst he really talks way below my 

388.50 389.82 B: age um 

389.90 391.03 B: cohort 

389.93 392.81 A: (( mhm [lipsmack] )) 

391.37 396.51 B: so i i know that i just don't even identify with it so i don't watch it 

397.03 398.73 A: yeah and i think that's 

398.92 401.05 A: [mn] i have 

401.35 403.15 A: walked out of a room 

403.21 407.63 A: rather than participate in something that other people think is funny 

407.30 408.32 B: mhm 

408.10 416.69 A: and whether i'm causing problems or whether i'm offending people by doing that or or whether they think i'm real stick in the mud i don't even know but i think as you 

415.43 418.77 B: it's a free world [laughter] 

416.84 427.00 A: [laughter] yeah i think you i think your values change over what's funny and what's objectionable ah given your situation uh 

427.18 430.09 A: what you've dealt with um 

430.24 433.43 A: and all that that sort of stuff you know it's [mn] 

432.23 433.20 B: certainly 

433.93 438.85 A: i think that has a lot to do with it i have a filipino daughter in law 

438.43 439.30 B: uh-huh 

439.03 441.41 A: [lipsmack] and i have a half filipino 

441.46 442.78 A: granddaughter 

442.54 443.46 B: uh-huh 

442.80 446.20 A: so racial things really bother me these days 

445.87 446.84 B: uh-huh 

446.74 454.62 A: because i've learned to appreciate them as people i i think philippine people are still classed as white 

454.32 455.25 B: yes 

454.80 464.31 A: but they'll see me with my granddaughter who is not very dark but has like a cafe au lait skin and we do get comments 

463.81 464.79 B: uh-huh 

465.06 468.51 A: you know and and or 

468.71 474.61 A: remarks and i just think that's while they might think it's funny i don't find it funny at all 

474.45 475.87 B: right right 

475.17 481.62 A: you know what i mean and i don't know what it's like in arizona i don't know what your racial mix is or anything like that is right now 

476.16 477.01 B: yeah 

480.48 488.90 B: well the county that i live in is more than ninety eight percent white it's very it's very bad here and i'd like to get out of here as soon as i can [laughter] 

487.93 494.53 A: mm and and i'm the opposite um in johnstown we're about um 

495.64 499.45 A: i'd say two thirds white [mn] the other third black 

499.04 500.36 B: mhm 

499.77 505.49 A: you know and i'm a teacher and of course i'm in a classroom with a mixed racial thing all the time 

505.34 516.31 A: and kids are forever making fun of each other or making derogatory jokes or whatever and i try to discourage it as much as possible 

517.41 521.13 A: and i think i think sometimes people 

521.54 528.71 A: use humor in sad circumstances maybe they feel uncomfortable so they make a joke 

525.53 526.87 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

528.51 529.43 B: right 

529.37 531.39 A: you know and i i find that 

532.06 534.09 A: sometimes i feel sorry for them 

533.84 534.80 B: uh-huh 

534.65 535.95 A: and sometimes 

536.03 541.68 A: with my own family i say i i find myself saying every once in a while you know that's totally uncalled for 

541.25 542.21 B: uh-huh 

542.19 551.66 A: i may be a bad judgment i don't know [laughter] you know it makes me wonder sometimes you know and i find humor on t._v. getting kind of bent out of shape these days 

551.09 558.58 B: mhm well it's addressing the majority and we're not it any more [laughter] at least not the t._v. watching majority [laughter] mhm mhm mhm mhm 

555.11 556.07 A: (( no )) 

558.15 561.56 A: (( no well you know um ah humor )) 

561.84 566.85 A: can be a very very good thing and it can be a very very mean and nasty thing 

566.79 577.17 A: and you know i find myself going more to the right as i get older i don't know i guess maybe that's just it getting older life experiences changes what you feel 

577.26 578.64 A: is good humor 

579.05 580.81 A: and what is not good humor 

580.97 591.88 A: and i keep on trying to teach or i i hope i have taught my children but certainly my grandchildren what is kind and what is not unkind and what is funny and what is not funny 

592.50 597.72 A: you know a pig fell in the mud's funny you know calling somebody a pig is not funny 

597.37 599.89 B: right well that's where it begins i mean tha- 

597.96 599.29 A: you know and
