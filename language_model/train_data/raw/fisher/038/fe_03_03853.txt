6.85 11.15 A: i've never done this before so they keep calling but i've never been around 

8.56 9.68 B: (( oh okay )) 

10.57 21.79 B: [laughter] uh i think this is the second time for me and i'm like comedy hm [laughter] [laughter] yeah well i guess we just 

17.48 19.18 A: an interesting topic 

21.58 28.52 B: um bungle on [laughter] um uh let's see i guess i'll just repeat the question 

23.19 25.00 A: that's fine [laughter] 

28.72 37.96 B: um comedy when is it in poor taste i guess i would think that um everyone has their own idea of what's funny 

38.13 43.07 B: and they would be their own personal preference as to what's in poor taste 

43.11 47.12 B: depending on how they were brought up or how 

47.13 47.94 B: um 

48.51 62.91 B: i don't know relaxed they are about certain attitudes i guess for example you know cursing is funny to me [laughter] i mean some of them [laughter] or you know jim carrey could be funny 

51.76 52.70 A: right 

55.85 57.14 A: [laughter] 

61.80 64.70 A: yeah yeah i'm not bothered by any of that 

63.71 71.60 B: yeah yeah i mean even you know like i'm not bothered by eddie murphy or or even chris rock yeah so like 

68.14 70.09 A: no i love eddie murphy 

70.67 74.31 A: there's very yeah i agree there's very little comedy that 

74.66 81.07 A: i find offensive i don't i don't like a lot of stabs at people or 

76.76 77.95 B: yeah 

81.67 87.61 A: people on the basis of race or gender i'm adverse to that kind of thing but almost anything else i find 

87.63 89.71 A: to be pretty amusing so 

87.63 88.86 B: yeah 

89.64 96.97 B: yeah that's true that's true and um gosh you know i i hardly watch comedy central any more so 

96.56 97.83 A: [laughter] 

97.18 99.00 B: so to me it's like wow 

99.36 110.01 B: i'm so out of it um 'cause i have kids and all we do is watch um oh i guess offensive would be oh now i remember [laughter] at least for the kids would be 

108.90 110.46 A: (( that's yeah that's right )) 

109.80 115.35 B: south park [laughter] or um or beavis and butthead 

111.06 112.26 A: [laughter] 

115.47 118.60 B: that's only because you know for them 

118.77 120.03 B: it they're 

120.20 122.51 B: two and five [laughter] 

121.45 126.94 A: yeah that might be a little bit offensive sometimes i think things are not exactly age appropriate 

126.77 128.65 B: right right 

127.48 142.07 A: i've seen part of eddie murphy's a couple of his standup shows and there's twelve and thirteen year olds in the audience and i think his material's funny but i don't think it's [cough] appropriate for a twelve or thirteen year old to be [laughter] at his show [mn] 

133.07 134.36 B: really 

138.82 140.35 B: yeah 

141.50 143.30 B: yeah that's true 

142.50 143.65 A: there may be 

143.72 146.06 A: some age restrictions might be better 

146.15 153.89 B: yeah that's true because um because children are at that age they're still kind of um 

154.01 155.39 B: what do you call it ah 

156.39 159.76 B: too young to really understand um 

159.32 162.73 A: right and you hope they don't understand 

160.04 161.49 B: (( some of the material )) 

162.07 169.00 B: yeah you hope you know they don't come home and start [laughter] and y-you're just going okay 

164.72 166.18 A: [laughter] 

168.43 180.20 A: they're still l- learning about a lot of things in life and a lot of things that [laughter] the comedians are joking about and hopefully they don't have the experience to think that some of that stuff is funny [laughter] 

173.14 174.25 B: yeah 

175.29 176.34 B: exactly 

179.43 187.28 B: yeah yeah that's true but i i um but let's see i like janeane garofalo she's really funny 

186.41 187.75 A: (( mm yes she is )) 

187.40 194.71 B: or um some of the political ones i guess they wouldn't understand but um gosh i guess for me 

194.98 197.38 B: um i have really 

197.98 202.85 B: ah no you know limits [laughter] [laughter] 

200.79 201.88 A: [laughter] 

202.08 207.04 A: i would have to agree i like um i'm actually going tomorrow to see bill cosby 

206.94 209.04 B: oh i love him 

207.34 210.03 A: do a standup show [laughter] 

209.30 211.36 B: oh really 

210.58 214.82 A: yeah and i love him and i think he's hysterical and he makes a lot of effort 

215.02 216.36 B: yeah 

215.07 218.25 A: to keep his comedy very clean and 

217.37 220.41 B: yeah 'cause it's he's family oriented 

219.81 221.57 A: right exactly 

220.99 230.92 B: yeah like um i think i have a video which i haven't seen yet i think it's just for kids like you know like parenting for children or something and 

230.97 235.20 B: i i bought it a long time ago and i meant to you know click it on 

235.00 236.29 A: [laughter] 

235.61 241.96 B: for the kids but i haven't but god bill cosby i would think he's like a universal comedian 

241.71 249.42 A: right anybody of any age could listen to him they might not [laughter] understand all of his comedy but he seems to be very good at 

245.20 246.56 B: (( yeah )) 

249.37 251.26 B: yeah yeah he really 

250.62 253.38 A: being appropriate for anyone and everyone 

253.12 257.51 B: yeah yeah he he understands children so well 

257.67 258.95 A: i think ah 

258.97 264.32 A: there's somewhere also i- in one of eddie murphy's stand up shows where he talks about bill cosby and how 

264.73 274.03 A: [laughter] bill cosby did not think eddie murphy was that funny and he didn't think his material was all that appropriate because it's so based on 

268.47 269.99 B: (( um [laughter] )) 

274.72 278.98 A: sex and going out and being crazy and 

278.24 279.67 B: yeah 

279.05 282.65 A: nothing nothing really that kids should listen to [laughter] 

282.28 289.79 B: yeah but that was um i would think at the time eddie that was this younger days 'cause he's so 

288.14 289.23 A: mhm 

289.80 294.73 B: so kid oriented now like his latest movie um daddy 

293.43 294.72 A: oh that's true 

294.81 296.27 A: daddy day care 

294.90 303.30 B: yeah yeah yeah i-i would think i could take my kids to see that and they'd probably really think it's funny [laughter] 

302.59 306.05 A: yeah i think his early stuff and he was very young when he did 

305.83 307.62 B: yeah yeah i think 

307.66 311.58 B: shocking he just wanted to shock america you know 

310.85 314.75 A: i think a lot of people do that people that i don't find quite as funny 

314.59 315.80 B: yeah 

314.81 321.59 A: it's not even that it's offensive but they people that say things for shock value and use that as comedy 

319.83 321.35 B: exactly 

321.72 330.41 B: yeah i can't remember there was one guy in particular that i had found offensive but that was because it was moan- mainly um 

330.48 338.19 B: talking down about to women or he pretends to be a male chauvinist but i can't remember his name 

335.59 336.68 A: mhm 

338.94 342.67 B: oh [laughter] then howard stern [laughter] 

339.81 340.94 A: [laughter] 

341.95 343.13 A: that's true 

342.78 343.81 B: [laughter] 

343.16 349.32 A: he goes in that category of shock value i gue- that- that's actually a good topic because 

345.70 347.49 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

349.85 355.66 A: i don't i-i don't really care for him or i don't find him all that funny because 

355.25 356.30 B: yeah 

355.67 362.50 A: like i said in the beginning he makes fun of people like people with disabilities or people that just cannot help 

362.77 364.42 B: did he did he 

362.81 365.27 A: something that they have and 

364.51 372.33 B: hm yeah i know that he- he's just you know trying to to get you know good ratings 

371.69 376.28 A: right and he wants to get a reaction from people but a lot of people find him hysterical 

374.09 375.17 B: right 

376.08 377.66 B: [laughter] 

376.87 380.46 A: and he doesn't [laughter] he doesn't make me laugh really 

378.35 379.65 B: [laughter] 

380.26 383.87 B: oh me neither i mean for a long time it took me a while 

384.07 386.89 B: you know 'cause my husband is so into him 

386.35 387.53 A: right 

386.95 389.59 B: and i'd go why are you watching that 

388.65 391.27 A: i know my boyfriend was always listening 

390.19 400.22 B: [laughter] yeah and he goes can't you get it this is a joke but you're yeah you know but it [laughter] but it's you know at my expense this is how i feel 

398.00 398.97 A: right 

400.22 406.86 B: especially have you seen um the one on television where he would have women you know and 

405.79 410.81 A: oh yes and he was always asking them to do all sorts of crazy things that are 

406.93 408.28 B: (( oh )) 

409.92 417.47 B: exactly exactly and i-i think that's in poor taste and i wouldn't want my daughter to watch that you know at any age 

416.72 418.61 A: no certainly not 

417.63 422.82 B: you know so i guess hey we've we've come to [laughter] 

420.39 427.29 A: that's one yes we definitely agree i think i think men find him much funnier than most women do [mn] 

426.65 434.03 B: yes yes i agree maybe you know they see something that we don't and or 

434.80 448.97 B: because i-i guess when i watch his movie i can kind of guess wh- where he's coming from but it's still you know when you watch his shows again you're just going yeah but it's still you know over the top and 

449.06 455.14 A: right that's how i think um i feel about him and i've seen sometimes shows where 

449.16 450.36 B: and 

451.41 452.47 B: yeah 

455.48 461.53 A: [mn] less intelligent people with fairly low i._q.'s will call in and say things and he just 

461.27 461.96 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

461.57 464.32 A: blatantly makes fun of people that have 

464.49 474.89 A: you know severe probl- y- you can tell that they have problems or learning disabilities or things and he uses something like that that i don't i don't particularly find that to be 

467.49 468.71 B: yeah 

469.43 470.60 B: yeah 

474.44 477.28 B: yeah that's true i mean you know 

476.48 477.82 A: all that humorous 

477.57 480.09 B: exactly unless you're not 

480.12 481.09 B: um 

481.15 486.92 B: it's a joke and and those people don't have low i._q. and they just call in and pretend 

485.61 487.36 A: (( mm right that's done )) 

487.26 497.42 B: yeah there's so much so much on t._v. you just can't tell but yeah it's um or um or violence i guess i'm going back to south park [laughter] or 

496.60 500.22 A: that's true i don't find the violence all that funny at all 

499.63 509.44 B: no no it's it's not funny you know un- unless you know you're a grownup and you realize it's a parody and for example the simpsons i think is really funny 

508.74 510.90 A: the simpsons is [mn] 

510.12 513.75 B: yeah whereas such you know diehard 

512.61 515.94 A: it's very intelligent humor to um a lot of people 

516.18 517.21 B: yeah 

516.27 522.64 A: apparently there are references through each show that i probably don't even pick up on and get but just the ones that i do are 

519.72 520.87 B: oh 

522.34 529.88 B: i know and and they're so great because you can keep watching the reruns and get something new out of it [mn] 

529.55 533.20 A: yeah it's very witty humor surprisingly and that's something that 

532.54 539.35 B: yeah and that it's still it's still you know really good is also surprising 

539.60 544.97 B: 'cause you think that you know i don't know how long it is been on the show you know on air 

543.53 546.40 A: i think [mn] something like ten years or 

545.91 547.97 B: wow wow 

546.72 549.05 A: something like years and years 

549.05 561.20 B: yeah yeah and actually my husband got me into the simpsons [laughter] 'cause at first i thought you know the humor is kind of dry and then he said come on watch a few episodes and 

553.31 554.77 A: [laughter] 

561.14 565.35 B: there was one particular episode that i just thought was hysterical 

564.73 566.29 A: [laughter] 

565.30 578.83 B: and you know ever since then i'm diehard fan [laughter] it was the one with the perfume i think he was um what was he great he was a plowman and he's wearing the jacket 

578.89 584.62 B: and he needed [laughter] he needed more clients he had done a commercial 

578.96 579.79 A: (( [laughter] [sigh] )) 

584.68 587.96 B: and it it looked like you know a commercial that 

588.11 598.69 B: you would do for a perfume ad or something but it was just hysterical it was just the way the parody is and you know you either you know you either get it or you don't [laughter] 

597.73 599.95 A: yeah i don't i don't think that i've seen
