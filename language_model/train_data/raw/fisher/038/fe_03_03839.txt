38.66 41.68 A: but we use uh you're from chicago now though huh 

40.96 42.31 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

42.22 45.56 A: well you have a good sense of humor if you're jerry springer on the show there 

44.81 57.17 B: [laughter] um yeah actually a lot of c- comedy comes from here 'cause there's a a famous you know the second city all the comedians out of saturday night live 

53.59 54.41 A: yeah 

56.70 58.44 A: right yeah i knew that 

57.72 61.69 B: studied there like chris farley and jim belushi and all those guys so 

61.31 63.02 A: (( yeah but they all kill themselves though )) 

62.39 71.25 B: yeah right [laughter] but uh i guess the question is when does controversial comedy cross the line to offensive comedy 

63.84 64.46 A: (( [laughter] )) 

71.40 82.09 A: well i think it depends on your audience of course the age of your your people you're talking to i i know that in the fire service that we've got to be careful of um jokes about women because there's women in the fire service 

81.58 83.40 B: right 

82.40 94.07 A: so we have to be really careful about about that however when it's introduced by a woman it seems a little more acceptable it kind of gives you a what what the playing fields all about you know 

84.44 85.36 B: uh-huh 

93.14 98.03 B: uh-huh yeah you have to sort of keep in mind your audience 

95.41 97.20 A: yeah normally the women don't 

97.92 100.72 A: right women don't normally offend the men too often 

100.37 104.82 B: mhm so do you guys make a lot of controversial jokes at work 

104.47 113.65 A: probably i i think like any other i i've got a lot of good friends that are teachers in the l._a. unified school district and and my wife 

105.52 106.95 B: [laughter] 

111.57 112.77 B: yeah 

113.42 121.00 A: um her family had been administrators and teachers for their um for the last thirty forty years but yeah that there is 

116.32 117.23 B: yeah 

120.94 131.01 A: a lot of them like anywhere there's some sexist jokes and things like you know remember richard pryor and things like he would say and chris i guess chris rock now he kinda cross the line sometimes but 

126.29 127.21 B: right 

128.56 129.47 B: right 

130.30 137.75 B: mhm well don't you think those people sort of make of fun of everybody so if you do that then you're sort of covered aren't you 

134.57 135.54 A: yeah 

137.54 140.94 A: i i think so too and i find humor very um 

140.88 154.08 A: tension relieving i know in my job it a lot of times it's stressful seeing somebody die or or uh get seriously injured or burned it's never funny but often times afterwards you may joke about something that happened at a call but just to relieve your tension 

148.40 149.66 B: right 

150.96 151.92 B: uh-huh 

154.29 156.06 A: i think it's great that way 

155.64 160.05 B: right have you ever experienced any comedy that made you sort of 

160.07 168.54 B: shudder at or that insulted you in any way on television or in the movies can you think of anything 

165.45 171.54 A: you know i i really i can only think of i wish i could say that i have but i know i haven't i know that um 

171.57 173.33 A: that my my my 

173.41 182.80 A: my band of uh of humor is goes from sick humor to you know it's a little slapstick i like benny hill i like richard pryor so it's all 

179.39 181.11 B: right 

181.83 182.72 B: uh-huh 

182.85 186.42 A: innocent fun i know that one time one of my instructors for um 

186.39 190.16 A: uh e._m._p. class for paramedics 

190.13 201.89 A: was talking about people how to handle uh take care of patients when they're pretty sensitive and she was talking about the word um i mean the t- term p._m._s. how sometimes women will be a little more uh 

201.70 215.38 A: on edge during that time of the month and she was a female instructor so we felt a little more at ease listening to her say that and um i know i heard a joke one time about someone saying p._m._s. at their house meant pack my suitcase 

202.67 203.79 B: oh right 

215.54 228.09 A: they wanna get out they wanna get out of the house when it was during that time of the month so that was pretty funny but you know i i don't know i you've got to be careful of well two things one with sexist remarks and with uh verbal uh 

215.55 216.53 B: uh-huh 

219.41 221.25 B: (( uh-huh [laughter] )) 

228.60 230.58 A: presentation to your students 

230.32 237.00 B: right yeah i i definitely avoid a lot of issues just to keep myself out of trouble 

236.87 238.81 A: well i know 

237.63 241.41 B: especially things that come up in the classroom i have to be very careful 

240.87 243.97 A: right y- y- your first language is spanish 

243.79 257.43 B: no no my first language is english but i also speak spanish fluently but i have students from all over the world so i don't use spanish in my classroom at all because i have students i have mostly adult students actually so 

246.15 246.97 A: oh 

253.46 254.40 A: oh 

257.42 258.46 A: (( okay )) 

257.48 268.87 B: so there are people from latin america as well as asia and you know russia you know all over the place so so it really wouldn't be fair for to me to speak spanish but um 

262.84 263.70 A: (( great )) 

269.19 282.53 B: i mean we get a lot of inter racial jokes in my classroom just as people like especially from latin america give like for example mexicans will give spanish people a hard time and these jokes seem light hearted 

282.86 286.16 B: but it's but you know feelings do get hurt so 

285.76 287.14 A: oh of course like 

286.53 298.92 B: any time something like that comes up i sort of try to make it clear to the student that you know we are accepting of everybody in the classroom and that those kind of jokes even as light hearted as they seem can't uh 

294.61 295.91 A: a buffer uh-huh 

299.01 301.82 B: can happen unfortunately in my class 

301.88 316.15 B: for me i think you know you have to laugh at everything including yourself and even some of the more outrageous comedians like say for example like howard stern if you've ever listened to him on the radio i mean he bashes everybody but um 

306.14 307.01 A: yeah 

312.67 314.40 A: yeah 

315.92 317.67 A: and he takes it himself too 

316.96 321.10 B: yeah exactly and i think that's that's important but i guess 

321.19 328.66 B: when you have to be careful is when something could be exposed to children um like south park for example 

325.28 326.51 A: right 

328.04 330.93 A: yes i don't even watch that 

329.92 342.61 B: you know that's something that that may be offensive and and maybe it's geared towards adults but i think a lot of kids watch it as well and and i think some of the uh i mean i just hear it at you know 

339.20 340.25 A: yeah 

342.86 350.66 B: i hear from a lot of kids' mouths but you know all the time and a lot of the stuff that they're learning from that show probably aren't very good so 

350.37 352.07 A: well the simpsons as well 

352.37 366.36 B: yeah right i i don't know i'm not one to blame media i think it's the parents' responsibility to sort of be there you know to as sort of to provide guidance of what you know whatever a child is exposed to so 

366.22 368.40 A: did you ever enjoy all in the family at all 

368.33 371.92 B: yeah th- that was probably a little ahead my time but 

371.35 374.69 A: yeah see that was that was right in my prime time 

371.99 373.03 B: um 

374.08 377.32 B: that was probably you know really shocking at one time 

376.52 378.61 A: real racist yeah 

377.63 381.78 B: yeah looking at it now i mean it looks pretty pretty calm [laughter] 

381.54 382.72 A: funny now 

382.13 384.04 B: (( yeah )) 

383.04 388.58 A: it was funny then too but then it was very uh very touchy and you know quite frankly the um 

388.59 398.82 A: the stations on t._v. were very bold in in putting that on t._v. and i know a local radio guy i don't know if you have do you have tom whikiss there in um in chicago 

392.43 394.24 B: right 

397.65 400.46 B: i i don't think so it doesn't sound familiar 

400.17 412.24 A: he's uh he's the top l._a. howard stern is the top radio guy and howard of course is the biggest guy in the morning here but in the afternoons in los angeles tom whikiss has the biggest the largest demographic of any any radio 

403.50 404.57 B: right 

412.03 420.58 A: personality at all and he's very sexist and very um he teaches men how to get tail on forty bucks or less in a day 

412.92 414.18 B: oh really [laughter] 

421.01 428.31 A: only go out three times with a girl before he gets something if he don't drop her and he's just he's really really controversial but he's very very funny 

423.72 424.69 B: uh-huh 

427.96 428.86 B: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

428.11 436.17 A: but he was he was saying as big he's been in radio for fifteen years and as big as he is he's over the six figure on an annual 

436.58 451.31 A: earn but when he gets to gets a chance to be on t._v. every network n._b._c. c._b._s. a._b._c. always tell him you can't say that you can't call a woman this you can't a woman that and he's never had a t._v. show 

447.89 448.91 B: right 

450.35 452.98 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

451.43 458.83 A: they won't they won't cross that line they do on radio but they won't do it except with howard of course you know i don't know if you watch e. channel 

454.63 455.90 B: yeah 

458.14 461.27 B: yeah sometimes i catch his show on there so 

460.11 465.25 A: and they bl- blur a lot of those things and fudge over some of his answers and 

462.25 464.17 B: (( yeah )) 

464.34 469.18 B: i wonder why the f._c._c. is different between radio and television 

468.78 473.44 A: isn't that i don't know that's weird too isn't it i don't understand that so 

471.19 472.82 B: yeah 

473.52 474.46 B: huh 

473.69 479.23 A: maybe we're all we're still learning maybe in twenty or thirty years we're gonna be looking back on ourselves and think we're strange 

478.26 487.87 B: well a- as comedy gets more controversial now what is the point of like what is you know when does it end really like how does 

487.98 492.84 B: as we're getting i mean there's stuff now that you know twenty years ago seemed 

492.86 499.83 B: you know way off track i mean where do you see yourself in twenty years i mean where would you have to go to get a laugh and what 

494.56 495.98 A: right yeah you're right 

500.26 503.28 A: i know when i was very young my parents how old are you can i ask 

502.77 504.71 B: i'm i'm twenty eight 

504.43 506.91 A: (( okay so i'm i've got a daughter twenty seven )) 

506.62 507.46 B: uh-huh 

506.85 508.38 A: (( but i i'm uh )) 

508.18 515.76 A: when i was a kid i remember just just old enough to think things were funny maybe ten or eleven i don't know and my family would listen to um 

515.55 525.21 A: bob newhart and of course bill cosby was funny then too and jonathan winters and those guys weren't dirty now now they're they're are a combination of both 

519.34 520.46 B: right 

524.92 526.36 B: right right 

525.91 530.50 A: maybe murder and and torture and death will be a a funny thing in a year's time 

529.87 537.74 B: yeah maybe i don't know i i sort of grew up on well reading the onion i don't know if it's a satirical newspaper i don't now if you're familiar with it but 

537.06 538.66 A: i i've heard it yeah 

537.92 545.46 B: they're very uh they're very sarcastic about everything and that's the sort of humor that i kind of like and there's a show called the daily show 

543.35 544.48 A: [laughter] 

545.34 554.93 B: on comedy central and uh john stewart and i think those are really funny and uh i think really after nine eleven those type of that type of humor 

545.45 546.47 A: yeah 

546.67 547.75 A: i see it 

548.35 549.36 A: right 

554.93 560.80 B: um i don't know it's it's it was harder to be funny in that way to be so 

560.95 567.23 B: i don't know to be so wry about everything in the sense when everyone was feeling uh 

563.71 564.80 A: that's true 

567.23 574.25 B: uh you know really upset about nine eleven and everything so and actually comedy central and the onion were two two 

574.10 582.70 B: comedic uh outlets that actually you know acknowledged nine eleven and that we were all kind of in a weird space after that and so 

581.82 584.28 A: yeah well now you must have cable t._v. huh 

584.10 585.51 B: yeah i do 

585.46 587.20 A: what does that run you a month 

587.03 594.02 B: uh i pay about thirty dollars but i have a roommate so we share it so it's not that it's really not that bad 

590.06 591.25 A: (( really )) 

591.85 599.89 A: oh okay yeah it's about about without the h._b._o. and the the max cinemax and the other channels we we pay about fifty
