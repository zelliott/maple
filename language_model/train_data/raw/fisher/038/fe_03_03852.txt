451.87 455.04 B: right [noise] sinbad is very clean too 

455.73 468.16 B: [noise] but you got to have a little because it's all about reality you know what i'm saying especially when they hit points [noise] [sigh] see it's like [sigh] how can i put it like if i was a house like if i was a house dad like i pretty much know 

459.21 460.18 A: mhm 

468.31 472.66 B: the the the the s- reality of being a parent 

472.38 473.37 A: uh-huh 

472.90 484.45 B: you know like you know it's got its ups and it's got its downs now if a comedian can come and talk about stuff like that [sigh] oh excuse me and i'm able to relate to that [noise] 

476.19 477.49 A: absolutely 

484.62 492.37 B: then if he might happen to say a cuss word or something or two and then y- i mean i might find it funny 'cause sure i might find myself in a crisis like one time
