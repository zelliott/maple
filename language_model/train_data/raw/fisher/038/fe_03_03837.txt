114.83 115.94 B: okay 

115.53 122.99 A: certain things i sit and i laugh at i don't particularly i have a two year old i don't know as as she got older if i'd want her to watch it 

122.38 123.96 B: right right

127.05 128.27 B: right right 

128.87 130.36 B: mhm mhm 

128.88 133.84 A: but i don't know it it's something that i'd let her watch as she got older and understood more 

133.55 139.00 B: exactly i guess some of the shows are okay but some are like you say they're a little bit risque 

138.57 139.70 A: mhm 

139.08 143.44 B: yeah 'cause there was another uh cartoon and it was called south park

146.28 147.43 A: um

152.25 153.63 B: right right 

153.06 157.37 A: um but it was again another show not for kids 

156.76 160.59 B: right but the whole thing is they got away with some of the stuff they were doing 

160.14 161.63 A: yeah they sure did 

161.35 167.71 B: yeah but you know what it's still playing here and my mother actually watches it now and finds it hilarious 

167.36 168.65 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

168.51 178.98 B: now you know because i mean i think there's just repeats but at the time it was playing when i would watch you know occasionally i really don't didn't care for it 

178.53 179.43 A: right 

179.38 180.89 B: but um yeah 

181.35 184.62 B: yeah some of the cartoons too how do you find them

194.55 195.58 B: (( oh okay )) 

197.26 198.74 B: right right 

198.26 204.62 A: but even the regular cartoons um from when i was growing up when you look at them 

200.15 201.00 B: mhm 

201.45 203.50 B: do you find right 

204.17 205.05 B: mhm 

205.76 209.70 A: i can't believe how um violent they can be 

209.03 216.43 B: they are actually very violent now that you talk you know mention it you would watch road runner right 

213.57 215.29 A: yeah i could not 

215.97 217.16 A: yes 

216.58 218.91 B: and or the bugs bunny hour 

218.80 219.51 A: (( yep )) 

218.96 224.01 B: and they forever would be pounding somebody with mallets throwing them off a cliff 

224.38 229.62 B: and like when we were young that was funny but you know what as an adult i don't find that funny 

229.66 230.42 A: no 

230.66 231.44 A: no 

231.48 239.05 A: i can't believe you know sitting here now and watching it and you're going oh my god i can't believe how violent they are 

234.41 235.48 B: right 

238.88 240.18 B: mhm mhm 

240.44 247.94 B: and see this is what i guess sometimes they're trying to put restrictions on what they show at a certain hour in the evening 

247.86 248.74 A: right 

248.52 251.12 B: right for drama shows 

251.22 257.98 B: but what they c- show in cartoons which should be comedy and fun actually is more violent 

258.26 262.21 B: than what they show in drama say police you know 

262.85 264.44 B: hours or whatever 

264.02 265.12 A: (( yeah )) 

264.50 267.19 B: do you ever find that mhm mhm 

265.43 266.51 A: yeah 

266.63 269.63 A: [mn] it's i like i said it's it's 

270.00 273.02 A: some of the stuff i maybe it's that i'm getting older 

272.64 273.55 B: right 

273.75 281.09 A: um some of the stuff that i found funny i don't find so funny any more like i said i have a feeling it's because i'm getting older 

277.42 278.45 B: right 

280.88 288.89 B: probably probably and what you see and learn from experience and know what hurts one someone right 

281.61 282.99 A: [laughter] 

288.47 289.59 A: yep 

289.60 294.59 B: for kids or young people they don't see that in the same light whatsoever 

294.19 295.32 A: yep 

294.77 295.70 B: you know 

295.85 302.83 B: do you ever watch any um comedy hours like when people go and do you know skits and stuff 

303.18 304.19 A: (( ah )) 

304.64 306.56 B: they're sometimes on television 

304.64 305.43 A: i'm 

306.39 309.31 A: when they go and i'm sorry i didn't hear you go and what 

308.87 313.39 B: like s- comedy skits like we used to have s._c._t._v. 

313.27 314.83 A: oh okay um like 

313.95 315.95 B: mad t._v. 

315.27 317.02 A: like saturday night live 

316.42 317.91 B: right right 

317.48 324.13 A: i haven't i watch it once in a while i don't watch it as much any more i don't find it as funny 

320.36 321.28 B: mhm 

323.57 324.80 B: right right 

324.40 328.16 A: than it like it used to be once in a while i'll put on mad t._v. 

325.97 326.89 B: mhm 

327.76 328.80 B: (( oh okay )) 

328.82 333.92 A: um but i haven't watched like saturday night live in [mn] how long 

333.73 334.98 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

335.15 338.99 B: 'cause you know what sometimes i find that things are almost so demeaning 

338.48 339.44 A: yes 

339.43 342.25 B: to whom ever they're portraying 

342.22 343.30 A: yep 

342.76 347.41 B: and sometimes it's not bad but sometimes it's like if you were that artist 

347.70 349.72 B: i would be so offended 

349.23 350.58 A: mhm 

350.19 351.06 B: (( you know )) 

351.64 356.47 B: so i don't know but um i think though comedy is good for health 

356.36 357.88 A: oh yeah 

357.27 360.61 B: you know that's what they say you need a really good laugh a day 

361.29 362.41 A: yep 

361.85 364.83 B: and it's sort of you know in good taste and all that 

365.40 369.16 B: but um yeah so you just have the one daughter 

369.06 370.57 A: i have one yes yes 

369.95 372.46 B: oh okay okay so she's still young 

372.62 375.50 B: so [mn] are you very restrictive in what she watches 

375.33 378.91 A: well she mostly likes ah the t._b._s. shows 

378.30 379.31 B: okay 

378.97 384.74 A: um like i said she watches 'cause she loves to watch the simpsons and 

383.14 384.14 B: mhm 

385.26 386.72 A: for right 

385.31 388.42 B: maybe it's j- maybe it's just the movement as well 

387.98 395.90 A: right i mean anything to her is um she calls them t- toons instead of cartoons even when you play some of these games on the playstation 

392.29 393.50 B: right right 

395.43 396.43 B: (( oh okay )) 

395.99 397.91 A: they look like cartoons to her 

397.40 398.38 B: right 

398.14 399.13 A: um 

399.16 406.19 A: so for now it's fine but as she got older i don't think i would probably let her watch the simpsons too many ideas 

404.65 408.74 B: right right mhm how about that other show um 

409.01 412.33 B: it's this couple from texas it's a cartoon 

413.34 414.43 A: (( i don't know )) 

414.30 415.67 B: oh you don't get it 

415.28 416.45 A: i don't i'm 

415.88 421.34 B: oh okay yeah in the evening it's a couple and they have i think two kids and they're 

416.49 417.49 A: (( i'm trying )) 

421.53 423.45 B: they live in texas and they have 

422.64 424.57 A: oh king of the hill 

423.97 425.34 B: right right 

424.87 427.40 A: we used to watch that it comes on very late here 

426.80 428.20 B: oh okay 

428.01 429.21 A: yeah we 

428.38 430.20 B: and how did you find that one 

429.87 431.24 A: it was okay 

430.92 433.06 B: okay it was kind of tame 

432.64 436.18 A: right it wasn't [mn] yeah it wasn't 

435.06 435.71 B: (( uh )) 

436.26 442.61 A: like the simpsons it wasn't it was okay like i said it came on very late and my husband used to work nights and we would watch it 

440.33 441.27 B: right 

441.87 445.54 B: oh 'cause you know we get it here like eight o'clock 

442.83 443.56 A: (( and )) 

445.38 446.33 A: okay 

445.97 448.85 B: so it's kind of a prime time 

448.56 449.63 A: right 

448.99 452.24 B: and i find it pretty tame with that peggy 

452.04 453.04 A: (( yes )) 

452.37 455.18 B: that's the mom and i can't remember the dad's name 

454.82 455.79 A: hank 

455.68 459.97 B: hank right but i find they're that comedy is okay 

460.51 465.00 B: but [mn] like you say some of the others are oh a little bit too much 

464.41 468.28 A: yeah like south park i'd never in a million years ever let her watch it 

467.69 469.02 B: mhm mhm 

468.88 469.83 A: never 

469.71 473.93 B: mhm i think when it first came out it was sort of a cute little thing 

473.79 474.75 A: right 

474.15 477.31 B: but you know as time go you know went on 

477.36 482.97 B: it just got too much into it and then they actually had it here late nights very late nights 

482.86 486.66 A: i used to w- when it first came out i used to watch it i got stuff from my 

486.80 497.43 A: um compu- you know from my computer and 'cause i loved it and then like i said it got a little bit over the top and i haven't really watched it 

489.52 490.45 B: right 

490.52 491.56 B: mhm 

494.85 495.72 B: mhm 

497.89 503.10 B: okay but you know when i watch say jay leno and they sometimes have comedians on 

502.77 503.86 A: right 

503.37 505.32 B: that humor i like 

504.80 505.77 A: me too 

505.54 509.95 B: because it's very sort of prime time everybody 

509.67 510.91 A: right 

510.57 513.99 B: or say seinfeld they're playing reruns 

514.25 515.24 A: right 

514.63 523.34 B: do you ever watch seinfeld you know what i never used to watch it before and then all of a sudden my son started watching the reruns and now i'm so hooked on it 

515.77 516.78 A: yes 

522.84 528.58 A: yeah i never watched it it when it had you know when it was out new we watched the repeats here 

526.42 527.74 B: right right 

528.35 534.09 B: oh okay it's sort of a dry humor and it's almost like it's a show about nothing 

534.02 535.17 A: exactly 

534.80 539.18 B: but it's yet i don't know some- somehow it's hooked me to it [laughter] for some reason 

537.88 538.66 A: (( yeah )) 

538.73 545.02 A: i mean some of the things they've do- you know i can identify with with being in the city some of the strange things that go on 

541.60 542.59 B: mhm 

543.82 544.96 B: (( oh okay )) 

545.05 546.00 B: okay 

545.05 545.87 A: (( yeah )) 

545.90 548.61 A: and the other one of our favorites is friends 

548.10 551.60 B: oh friends right right see yeah that's okay too 

551.47 555.27 A: yeah that one we watch my husband had never watched that one before 

554.95 557.80 B: oh me neither can you believe it 

556.02 557.13 A: (( and um )) 

557.21 558.31 A: never 

557.89 561.68 B: no well i mean occasionally occasionally 

558.32 559.29 A: i had been 

562.14 566.56 B: but you know i'm starting to get into those those old shows 

562.28 562.94 A: (( yeah )) 

567.08 568.85 B: the really older ones 

567.10 567.81 A: (( uh )) 

568.58 578.26 A: yeah see i had watched it from the beginning we actually watched the um repeats so that he could try to catch up and the blockbuster here had the first and second seasons 

570.43 571.49 B: okay 

574.26 575.10 B: mhm 

577.69 578.67 B: okay 

578.30 582.59 A: on ah d._v._d. so he watched it so he could kind of catch up 

582.00 583.12 B: right 

583.71 584.75 A: so 

584.46 589.94 B: mhm but you know what somehow with that or say with seinfeld it's almost 

590.33 595.52 B: you can kind of go into it and kind of still get it after a few episodes 

594.91 596.03 A: mhm 

595.81 599.89 B: especially seinfeld but maybe not so much friends because if they start
