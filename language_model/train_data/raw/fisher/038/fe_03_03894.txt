8.66 9.95 B: comedy 

10.78 11.80 A: yes 

11.37 13.62 B: and the line between 

14.13 19.39 B: acceptable and unacceptable humor is that that's my understanding of the topic 

19.31 20.73 A: yeah that's the topic 

20.29 21.24 B: uh-huh 

21.39 24.33 B: h- um is your first uh of these 

23.53 25.64 A: (( yeah this is first time i've never done this )) 

24.60 26.99 B: yeah me too so [laughter] 

27.21 28.62 A: what are we supposed to do 

28.17 30.72 B: um i think we're just supposed to discuss 

31.26 34.85 B: um that topic like how we determine 

35.35 37.96 A: oh what's uh what's comedy and what's not 

37.41 46.39 B: what's comedy what's not or what maybe what crosses the line from [lipsmack] acceptable into bad taste or [sigh] [mn] 

41.82 42.66 A: yeah 

46.98 48.51 B: unacceptable 

49.07 51.47 A: yeah i see what you're saying um 

50.35 51.55 B: yeah 

51.76 53.20 A: i guess it [mn] 

53.73 56.37 A: i don't know you i guess you can start off if you 

56.39 64.94 B: well i i have actually i've i have discussed this because i actually work actu- i [sigh] i um use humor a lot in my work so 

64.89 66.30 A: all right oh really 

65.74 71.50 B: um so it comes up a lot um and it seems that there you know there's different 

71.83 74.69 B: like there's there's the standard um [lipsmack] 

75.43 80.02 B: you know that uh saying that uh tragedy plus time 

80.06 82.57 B: equals comedy have you ever heard that 

82.76 84.88 A: uh i've never heard of it but 

82.80 83.95 B: expression 

84.29 90.48 B: well it it kind of means like like say you know some awful tragic event has happened and you know how 

91.35 102.87 B: how kind of jokes start coming up around it or or a hot you know if there's some kind of hot scandal or something i don't know how how i'm i'm forty seven i don't know how old you are [sigh] 

94.17 95.91 A: yeah yeah true 

102.43 104.85 A: yeah i'm only like twenty one but still 

103.81 107.26 B: uh-huh 'cause i mean you could take something 

107.49 120.13 A: yeah there's like yeah especially like a tr- like other than a personal tragedy but like there's a period of time before any [sigh] i guess if there's any serious event there's a period of time before you can actually start joking about it to a person 

119.38 126.27 B: right before it really feels like it's acceptable even though and then they and then things kind of start trickling 

121.45 122.36 A: yeah 

126.61 130.53 A: yeah [laughter] yeah so like a person gets more comfortable so 

126.68 128.60 B: in right 

130.10 131.34 B: right people put 

130.55 131.34 A: (( can't )) 

131.40 135.24 A: you can't feel someone make someone feel uncomfortable so it's kind of a border 

135.44 141.55 B: yeah but not even personal tragedy kind of [sigh] collective tragedy i i mean i can't think 

135.50 137.06 A: that's a little bit more 

141.73 143.67 B: i i right now i can't think of 

143.71 155.08 B: jokes but i remember there were you know say after the world trade centre events you know there started to be kind of some bin laden jo- at first there weren't bin laden jokes right 

149.24 150.25 A: yeah 

154.89 158.31 A: yeah for in the beginning it was really serious 'cause of what happened 

157.74 161.23 B: right and it still is really serious but at the point at which 

160.36 164.40 A: it hasn't y- yeah but like the bin laden jokes were never there in the beginning 

163.72 165.39 B: right and then 

166.04 168.99 B: stuff like on the tonight show and 

169.21 170.10 B: you know 

169.23 171.00 A: yeah on every yeah 

170.14 174.86 B: on television they the the those kinds of humorous started 

175.89 181.93 B: [mn] you know there was humor that evolved around that topic which it was it was and still is a really 

182.40 184.03 B: [lipsmack] you know a serious 

183.40 185.01 A: serious topic yes 

184.37 186.00 B: to- uh thing but 

186.34 188.70 B: w- you know the humor started [sigh] 

188.43 190.17 A: after a time period 

189.14 192.32 B: yeah and so th- i think that that's where that expression 

192.87 200.28 B: [sigh] um tragedy plus time equals comedy or [sigh] you could take it on a personal level like um [sigh] 

193.31 194.51 A: (( yes mhm )) 

201.05 202.81 B: [lipsmack] you know say your say 

203.40 209.91 B: i mean this is it's very trivial compared to o- other things but say you stub your toe right 

209.77 210.63 A: yes 

210.07 212.46 B: and in the moment that you do it 

212.62 219.57 B: the pain is so tremendous [laughter] [sigh] that that that you can't even laugh about it and then maybe 

215.00 216.46 A: yeah and you're not gonna 

219.57 221.22 A: to you can joke about it later 

220.35 225.01 B: uh yeah even a few seconds later wh- when once that immediate uh 

225.81 231.84 B: impact has worn off you know you might start making jokes about your own clumsiness 

232.29 236.65 B: or something like you know that's a really kind of very simplistic 

236.76 243.42 A: yeah true of course there's a you know period o- there's well uh yeah there's time and th- what other issues could they be on 

238.05 238.90 B: thing 

243.70 247.05 B: and well another thing about what the line of 

247.15 249.06 B: um what is 

249.31 262.99 B: it not on- not [mn] just the come- the tragedy plus time thing but just what [sigh] what is acceptable and what is not acceptable as far as humor and that that changes from uh person to person and i think and group to group 

257.36 258.24 A: yeah 

260.75 261.69 A: yeah that's 

261.78 271.66 A: yeah that's the other thing yeah it depends you have to r- really see who the person is and how they feel about it normal reaction you can say plus your line is 

267.68 268.67 B: (( mhm )) 

269.55 270.52 B: yeah 

271.28 273.93 B: [sigh] yeah well i i um [lipsmack] 

274.30 286.88 B: i i i can appreciate kind of the n- [sigh] the nuances of you know what's called black humor and dark humor and stuff that's on the edge [sigh] but you also have to be careful about w- what 

283.31 284.17 A: yeah 

287.29 289.75 B: the perceptions of 

290.11 291.50 B: the listener 

291.65 295.89 B: are 'cause there are jokes that i think would be perceived as 

297.04 303.30 B: uh are given in in the con- given two different types of audiences or two different people 

303.12 304.43 A: (( mhm )) 

303.71 314.87 B: one person or one audience would understand um a kind of joke to be satire or poking fun at 

315.02 318.51 B: not the subject of the joke but the teller of the joke [sigh] 

318.61 320.30 B: and another group 

318.84 319.79 A: mhm 

320.42 327.80 B: would have a much more simplistic view of it [sigh] like i'm trying t- but i'm trying to think of um an example of 

327.98 330.01 B: the joke there's a a couple 

330.14 343.69 B: that are uh a couple of jokes okay one i'm i'm jewish okay [lipsmack] and there's a joke that i think is a really great joke it's a dark joke and it's complicated but i'm going to tell it and [lipsmack] 

334.51 335.46 A: yeah 

341.16 342.16 A: yeah 

343.78 344.93 B: and then 

345.33 350.32 B: well um you know i it's an example of a joke that in some situations and with some people 

350.19 351.24 A: it's funny 

350.71 353.86 B: if if people are going to get it in the right way 

354.08 362.66 B: other people might laugh at it for the wro- for what i would call the wrong reasons okay [sigh] okay so the joke is i'm i'm walking down the street right 

358.58 359.85 A: (( yeah true )) 

362.48 363.30 A: mhm 

362.82 364.24 B: and um [lipsmack] 

364.88 366.21 B: a guy 

366.31 371.18 B: i see a guy walking down the street and he he looks just like adolf hitler 

371.14 372.08 A: uh-huh 

371.42 373.56 B: and i go up to him and i say hey 

373.90 377.05 B: you look just like adolf hitler 

377.03 377.93 A: yeah 

377.40 380.92 B: and he says well i am adolf hitler and i go 

381.14 388.58 B: [sigh] you're not hitler h- fortunately [sigh] adolf hitler is dead and he goes well um [lipsmack] i am adolf hitler 

388.68 390.42 B: and i came back 

390.43 394.21 B: you know from the dead and i'm him and i said listen why would you 

392.31 393.44 A: yeah 

394.65 403.73 B: [lipsmack] this is the joke remember it goes on for a while [sigh] why would you claim to be adolf hitler who embodies evil right you've killed 

397.47 398.17 A: (( uh-huh )) 

402.14 403.55 A: yeah true 

404.04 406.82 B: millions and millions of people 

407.16 413.13 B: alone you killed just just jews not to mention all the people you killed [sigh] um 

412.09 412.97 A: mhm 

413.31 415.58 B: six million jews alone 

415.79 423.26 B: and millions of others but six million jews and and the guy uh who says he's hitler he says well you know what i'm back 

418.64 419.42 A: yes 

423.34 428.41 B: [sigh] and i'm going to kill six million more jews and a clown 

428.64 430.48 B: and i said a clown 

430.53 431.50 A: yeah 

430.95 433.91 B: and he said see no one gives a shit about the jews 

434.63 435.80 A: oh [laughter] 

435.25 436.40 B: you see [laughter] 

436.18 437.57 A: yeah okay 

436.63 438.47 B: you see the joke [laughter] 

437.77 439.23 A: (( yeah i see the joke )) 

438.93 439.76 B: so 

440.15 445.29 B: it it it the joke it it's a joke about a few things at the same time 

445.33 447.28 A: yeah okay yeah i see 

445.96 450.68 B: you know [sigh] 'cause like some people like if that was if that joke was being told 

450.71 455.31 B: to say a bunch of anti sem- you know people who really hated jews 

455.21 456.20 A: yeah 

455.62 465.17 B: you know what they would be laughing at is yeah [laughter] hitler's going to kill a bunch of jews you know but the joke is not about killing the jews the joke 

461.13 462.33 A: (( yeah that's true )) 

465.63 468.17 B: is kind of about anti semitism 

468.40 471.09 A: (( yeah i see what you're saying and yeah )) 

469.11 473.41 B: right you know it's like because 'cause what he totally focuses on 

473.83 480.13 B: you know it's the absurdity of going and a clown and someone going w- a clown 

480.55 487.06 B: where did that come from you know it's like and and him not and just going yeah well see you didn't even care about all those millions of jews 

481.00 481.73 A: (( i )) 

481.95 482.84 A: see 

487.45 488.49 B: so that's 

488.54 495.24 B: that that's like a i think a an example of a joke that is right it it's in the territory 

495.39 496.38 B: of 

496.87 502.35 B: [mn] in some cases and for some people it it goes too far 

502.26 504.96 A: yeah but see there were yeah [sigh] that actu- 

503.79 510.14 B: and other people accept it because they have a an understanding of all its subtleties 

509.74 515.82 A: you yeah ev- but even if you have an understanding it depends even for a jew it might depend on like as in 

515.98 519.93 A: what like how serious the event was to them you know 

519.23 520.68 B: exactly 

520.56 522.30 A: yeah so there's 

521.09 525.91 B: right 'cause it's not just a mat- it it it's right exactly so [sigh] that's what 

524.99 533.57 A: even if they don't yeah agree with the jew killing but they might just think that or this type of situation is not something even you should joke about even a little you know 

533.07 543.84 B: right p- yeah exactly so that's an exam- i mean i that's [sigh] that's where that joke lives in the territory of i think the topic of this 

533.81 534.56 A: yeah 

544.09 551.04 B: conversation you know that that's why i that's why i used it as an example 'cause it i think it really demonstrates 

545.67 546.64 A: yeah 

551.97 553.22 B: how 

553.39 554.56 B: something 

556.06 556.99 B: can 

557.27 559.08 B: on on one hand 

559.39 559.95 B: (( [mn] )) 

560.33 563.45 B: be understood by [mn] one person 

563.88 574.06 B: you know on all it's levels and they understand the offence that's in it [sigh] but they they get they get that it's almost like a piece of social commentary 

568.77 569.59 A: (( uh-huh )) 

574.42 577.71 B: 'cause the joke really is it's a social satire 

577.80 579.29 B: the joke kind of 

577.92 580.17 A: (( yeah yeah it is )) 

579.52 580.63 B: but 

580.62 584.70 B: a- also i there are cert- there are certainly times when i 

584.49 595.83 B: you know it's not a joke that i tell freely you know i don't go around and go hey did you hear the one about [laughter] you know [laughter] [sigh] you know um you really have to kn- 

590.29 592.79 A: yeah that would definitely you don't want yeah 

596.01 599.89 B: [mn] appreciate and respect the experience [sigh]
