0.76 2.67 B: hello this is valerie 

3.12 5.38 A: [lipsmack] uh orlando medina 

5.24 6.19 B: hello 

7.14 9.79 B: how do you feel about comedy 

10.38 11.16 A: uh 

11.22 12.83 A: it's a good thing 

12.15 13.80 B: (( [laughter] [noise] [laughter] )) 

13.92 19.84 B: i feel that there it is a very good thing everyone needs some comedy in their life to keep 'em happy [sigh] 

20.05 28.06 B: there are the point where some comedy i guess is unacceptable depending on you know [sigh] who you're in the presence of [laughter] 

27.91 39.44 A: right i mean i'm thinking comedy is basically [sigh] you you base your comedy based on knowing what your audience is i think from that point on then if it's 

35.74 37.09 B: (( right exactly )) 

39.27 48.92 A: raunchy comedy then you've obviously selected an audience that's going to deal with that and if it's more of um middle of the road comedy then 

44.15 45.56 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

48.87 57.14 A: that's usually what you expect and i don't think people like to [sigh] experience uh the surprises with comedy for the most part 

55.51 56.38 B: no 

56.57 57.99 B: yeah i agree 

58.94 60.29 B: (( mm [laughter] )) 

61.50 64.71 B: yeah i'd i'd appa- unfortunately i think that there are 

64.82 66.43 B: too many people that 

67.26 68.22 B: don't 

68.81 73.43 B: use it properly and es- especially like you hear things in the workplace that are 

73.97 75.34 B: you know people aren't 

75.92 87.51 B: saying things you know appropriate in front of certain people and [sigh] which sometimes i think that gets taken too far that people are say that they're offended and [sigh] you know take things just too far instead of just kinda 

88.30 91.02 B: taking themselves from the situation you know they they kinda 

90.11 99.43 A: right well then it becomes politically incorrect and then people would consider it not maybe comedy but more a level of harassment too so 

93.07 94.38 B: mhm 

98.10 99.74 B: right yeah 

99.73 100.97 A: [sigh] it uh 

100.09 100.90 B: (( very good )) 

101.64 114.48 B: there are some times when you know i think that a person can just remove theirself from the situation but there are you know i'm sure there are times when it is actually harassment but [sigh] i think of that harassment is just taken a little bit too far in [laughter] in this day 

101.65 102.82 A: it varies 

114.53 120.74 A: [sigh] right but you never can tell when that's going to be used so it's best to stay clear of it [sigh] 

116.55 117.75 B: exactly 

118.13 118.98 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

122.42 124.82 A: hm i'm thinking also 

123.57 124.60 B: (( [lipsmack] [laughter] )) 

124.62 139.60 A: from a comedy standpoint people understand who's delivering the comedy and have also decided whether that is something that they continue or continue like the difference between robin williams and say paul rodriguez [sigh] 

130.32 131.26 B: mhm 

139.56 148.88 A: and if that's the comedy that they enjoy then they tap into it or frequent that uh or improv or whatever that type of comedy is that they're looking for [sigh] 

146.88 147.79 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

148.79 154.81 B: yeah [sigh] obviously if you're going to go see a a show you know who you're going to see so you're not gonna [laughter] 

148.97 149.97 A: and 

153.21 156.55 A: right then uh if you're going to see eddie murphy then it's going to be a little 

155.96 159.06 B: you'd better not bring a young one [laughter] 

157.92 171.47 A: right or andrew andrew dice clay was another one that uh again understanding who you're going to is is also just as important as [sigh] when these comedians get in front of an audience they obviously it's bar none 

171.43 173.58 B: yeah mhm yeah 

171.98 174.99 A: nothing none they don't hold anything back so 

173.88 179.86 B: oh they have no holding back on that [laughter] [sigh] and then there's people like gallagher who you know 

175.67 176.87 A: right 

179.54 183.39 A: right and all you can expect is fruit juice all over yourself [lipsmack] 

179.99 180.89 B: (( prides his )) 

181.25 184.07 B: (( goofy [laughter] )) 

184.95 187.24 A: yeah um [sigh] 

188.57 198.06 A: i guess um if there's levels of comedy there's also kid comedy as well which actually becomes more of t._v. programming 

194.47 195.54 B: yeah 

198.42 199.60 B: yeah 

199.55 209.59 A: versus drama or anything else so and i think kids are into more of [sigh] when they think comedy they think more of slapstick or muppets or something that 

201.51 202.49 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

208.82 209.80 B: yeah just 

210.00 212.09 A: so there's different levels of it 

210.10 211.68 B: pure silly [sigh] 

212.05 213.39 B: i like um 

213.40 226.14 B: comedy about kinda just things that happen [noise] in everyday life 'cause you hear all the someone else thinking it's funny and you realise [sigh] hey that happened to me and it's kinda humorous to hear somebody else say that it's happening to them [laughter] [mn] 

224.71 232.50 A: exactly if you can relate to it then that's draws in more of uh what you think is funny because you can relate [sigh] 

232.43 233.67 B: yeah 

233.08 236.77 A: and i think when people can't relate then it is actually isn't funny so 

236.00 243.19 B: mhm yeah that's why you have to you depending on the audience that you're working with if you were a comedian [laughter] 

243.17 244.32 A: yeah 

243.61 245.10 B: you wouldn't want to be [laughter] 

245.96 258.06 A: well that's when you get into stuff like uh roseanne barr from a housewife's perspective would would tap into stuff like that or [sigh] hm i'm thinking who else would actually get there's more specific on 

250.08 251.30 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

259.26 264.02 A: th- the audience themselves or who they who they think their audience is 

263.57 264.74 B: (( [noise] right )) 

264.51 268.58 A: b- but then there's also you can select gay lesbian 

268.59 272.52 A: comedians and that's what they're going to make fun of probably straight people 

272.12 272.94 B: (( [noise] )) 

273.49 274.77 A: and vice versa [sigh] 

273.83 275.15 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

276.79 277.68 B: there's 

277.79 282.67 B: i've never heard of a gay comedian [laughter] before so i'm not sure [laughter] what what they make fun of but 

281.16 282.62 A: (( oh they )) 

282.81 289.57 A: they they're out there if you go to las vegas and stuff they have comedians of all size and shape 

284.36 285.17 B: huh 

288.87 295.07 B: the only comedian i have ever actually seen live was ray [noise] well who's actually just passed away [noise] 

295.08 299.86 B: but it was ray coombs the comedy i went to a comedy club and he was there [laughter] 

299.24 301.45 A: oh yeah [laughter] [sigh] yep 

302.07 303.56 A: [lipsmack] um 

303.14 304.54 B: (( yeah )) 

305.23 308.20 A: [sigh] i got i'm thinking of other levels of comedy 

309.42 312.87 A: even within the movies themselves [lipsmack] 

309.71 310.96 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

313.37 314.75 B: [noise] yeah there's 

315.48 325.61 B: [sigh] well it just depends on the movies too [noise] i mean you have to really [sigh] i mean when you go to see a movie or you watch one in your home you [sigh] just have to look [noise] and see who's the star and you'll know [noise] if it's going to be [sigh] 

325.53 337.21 B: you know raunchy comedy or just kind of something your family can watch [noise] especially like with [sigh] well i guess eddie murphy's not some of his he's had some more family oriented movies [sigh] [noise] recently but he used to be pretty [laughter] i 

337.03 348.40 A: well with yeah with with eddie murphy raw i think that's kind of where it started and i think he's kind of tapered off a bit [sigh] uh robin williams can go anywhere any time sometimes you just don't know 

337.25 338.03 B: (( don't know )) 

338.21 339.30 B: foul [laughter] 

341.93 343.48 B: (( [noise] yeah yes he )) 

346.69 347.68 B: yeah 

348.04 349.13 B: mhm 

348.50 354.71 A: 'cause this latest one from uh i think it was madison square garden [sigh] he definitely throws in some surprises [sigh] 

353.95 354.79 B: huh 

356.90 364.07 A: and and it was good i mean and he works hard at that but again it's that you get surprised on a lot of his stuff 

357.49 358.74 B: [noise] [noise] 

363.58 364.87 B: yeah huh 

365.96 375.98 B: (( i've just seen him in movies and [sigh] thought he was a pretty good actor but never like i say well ray combs was the only one i've seen [laughter] i don't remember him being terribly )) 

373.55 374.82 A: yeah 

376.04 377.16 B: (( funny [noise] )) 

377.49 382.97 A: [sigh] well and then game show hosts too i mean when you take someone like a letterman or a jay leno then that's 

383.56 389.69 A: that uh actually i think is they can be more of a predicted comedy when you know he's going to do his top ten 

389.78 394.12 A: or whatever else the you know jay leno the headlines 

393.58 394.95 B: mhm 

394.76 401.33 A: those are things that at least you can anticipate that you know it to me that's kind of almost that's a safe comedy 

400.84 402.21 B: mhm 

402.45 404.69 A: was that was that our time 

404.11 411.44 B: no i think i don't know what that was but i think they come on and tell you [laughter] at least that's what i thought [laughter] maybe something on your end [laughter] i don't know what it was [laughter] huh 

405.89 406.62 A: (( oh )) 

407.74 408.90 A: okay 

410.82 411.75 A: no 

412.59 413.57 B: but [sigh] 

415.15 422.10 B: yeah i think that comedy's a good thing i think everyone needs that in their live people that take everything too seriously and 

422.00 430.23 B: you know don't allow themselves to laugh about things especially just the everyday life events that [sigh] comedians usually talk about i think that they're [sigh] 

430.86 435.91 B: kinda losing out on something [laughter] 'cause you need that release [laughter] that laughter gives you [laughter] 

434.03 437.62 A: that's and it can be contagious too so 

436.80 438.07 B: [laughter] 

437.98 451.97 A: yeah and i i have a lot of uh comedy actually comes into play when people just when people socialize because there's always going to be somebody in that group that is the life of the party and it's usually the comedian in the group 

444.75 445.90 B: mhm 

451.43 452.29 B: (( that's true )) 

452.33 461.83 A: that almost takes over and [sigh] basically entertains the group for the rest of the evening i think everybody tries to compete with that one person or at least match up [sigh] 

462.44 468.77 B: yeah are you a comedian yourself do i co- [laughter] you sound very serious and but intelligent 

463.73 465.61 A: no not at all 

468.17 468.73 A: (( [sigh] )) 

469.03 473.27 A: no i but i usually can entertain to a certain point [sigh] 

472.81 474.05 B: yeah 

473.94 479.84 A: but i'm more into actual uh real life situations and how to turn them around 

479.26 480.59 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

480.95 487.45 A: and especially having kids having a highschool daughter you find things that are quite amusing 

486.92 488.84 B: (( oh yeah )) 

487.53 489.61 A: (( [sigh] and )) 

490.16 494.71 B: yeah mine are still young and i have plenty of things already that i [laughter] 

494.40 504.17 A: nope when you can go buy a a dress for two hundred bucks and my first car cost that much that's the problem [sigh] [laughter] i'm thinking you know when do you get the oil changed on that thing anyway 

503.80 507.53 B: [laughter] [sigh] can you drive the dress around [laughter] 

505.39 507.19 A: yeah you cannot 

507.31 516.24 A: nope and the same thing when i go to a a home depot and somebody says this barbecue grill's two hundred bucks and i still go back to the fact that my car cost two hundred bucks 

508.04 508.69 B: [laughter] 

516.81 517.97 B: and they probably say [laughter] 

517.35 520.76 A: and the older man laughs at me says i can relate to that [sigh] 

521.23 522.68 A: he says i don't blame you 

522.53 523.27 B: hm 

524.19 526.46 B: yeah times change fast uh-uh 

526.55 528.11 A: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

528.23 530.86 A: i'm thinking what other aspect of comedy 

531.07 540.28 A: um improv probably i don't know if you've sat through any kind of improvisation where we've done it in chicago where you actually just give them topics 

539.87 541.43 B: (( hm no i've not hm [laughter] )) 

540.40 551.38 A: and they basically take [sigh] a lot of company acronyms and whatever else and turned it into entire [sigh] skit that actually comes pretty close to what we live 

552.76 553.60 B: huh 

553.57 555.36 A: or florida too so 

554.94 556.93 B: i think i would like that [laughter] 

556.24 561.05 A: yeah [sigh] and i think kids too start to want to jump into 

561.17 567.06 A: their version of comedy is more in the approach of probably trying to get attention 

566.75 568.03 B: mhm 

567.42 580.80 A: and i think if you find out most of the comedians out there were in that in that situation [sigh] where they were usually the youngest in the family or the or sometimes the only one that didn't get the attention that was the way to get it 

572.37 573.60 B: oh yes 

575.96 576.76 B: [laughter] 

580.09 588.49 B: mhm well that's what they say about children in school that if they're acting out a lot of the time it's just because they're wanting that attention they're not really if you're the one that's 

588.55 591.20 B: causing a distraction or disruption at school 

588.64 589.24 A: (( [noise] )) 

589.48 595.42 A: yep either attention or they're not being challenged and therefore they become disruptive 

591.73 592.78 B: mhm 

593.03 593.95 B: yeah 

594.81 596.10 B: yeah 

595.68 598.58 A: maybe the comedy starts to leave at one point 

598.54 599.89 B: (( [laughter] it becomes an annoyance ))
