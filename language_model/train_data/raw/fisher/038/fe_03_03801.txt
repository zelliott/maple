20.68 21.90 A: they're asking 

21.97 26.01 A: or like what comedy is in bad taste or what you consider 

25.02 27.10 B: oh comedy oh okay

33.28 34.18 A: i mean 

35.09 43.83 A: you i don't know like there's there's different types of comedy and like a lot of the comedy now is just like really shock comedy like and people say whatever 

43.99 44.93 A: like 

45.07 52.97 A: they'll just say like whatever they think not caring like if it i mean their goal is to like shock people and therefore make 'em laugh you know 

51.50 55.96 B: right right but i think it depends on the audience i mean 

56.02 57.00 A: yeah oh 

56.33 57.92 B: they have to use 

58.23 61.42 B: really good taste depending on audience or 

61.17 64.82 A: yeah you're not gonna go into like a senior citizens home and start talk about you know 

65.05 65.88 B: no 

66.62 69.65 A: stuff that you talk about to like teenagers

76.97 83.67 B: uh i haven't seen the whole thing my grandkids got it and i i looked at it a little bit 

83.68 84.80 A: it's uh 

85.09 87.61 A: like some of that comedy is just like 

87.66 88.60 A: you know 

88.78 98.25 A: it's like the shock you know like people laugh because they don't expect any normal human being to do that like do this those kind of things that those guys do you know 

96.08 98.16 B: right right 

99.38 107.25 A: so like for the audience they're aiming for like people that watch m._t._v. like young the younger crowd you know that that comedy's effective 

104.94 105.97 B: right 

107.55 108.37 A: (( but i )) 

107.57 108.62 B: (( how old are you how )) 

108.86 111.55 A: what how old am i i'm twenty one 

109.76 110.86 B: old are you 

111.49 114.26 B: (( twenty one i'm sixty sixty three )) 

112.11 113.10 A: how about you 

114.05 116.14 A: sixty three you don't sound sixty three 

115.99 118.50 B: oh thank you oh believe me i am [laughter] 

117.94 118.88 A: [laughter] 

118.70 120.99 B: actually i'll be sixty four next week 

120.76 121.76 A: really 

121.79 125.71 B: yeah so probably my uh 

126.25 132.28 B: my outlook is a little different than yours although i'm i consider myself pretty progressive 

128.79 129.58 A: yeah 

132.80 134.93 B: and there's a lot of things that make me laugh 

135.52 136.39 B: um 

137.81 140.35 B: i don't think vulgarity is a necessity 

140.69 146.43 B: but at the same time i i'm not adverse to it once again depending on the audience 

146.87 147.60 B: (( you know )) 

147.68 161.90 A: yeah see like i had a teacher i'm in college right now so i had a professor and she said that like the reason people laugh at like vulgar like vulgarity and like when people tell jokes that are really vulgar is because people are uncomfortable with 

158.64 159.48 B: (( mhm )) 

161.87 168.33 A: like the vulgarity of the joke so laughing is just like a natural reaction to kind of make us more comfortable 

168.06 173.00 B: right right i i agree it's kind of a knee jerk reaction 

172.42 173.72 A: yeah 

173.13 175.54 B: or a cover up so to speak 

175.69 179.98 A: but i i don't know i think it'd be a nice transition to see you know 

180.07 184.15 A: um comedy that doesn't have the vulgarity to come into 

184.90 187.25 A: you know come into its own 

185.36 188.70 B: yeah well i i like some of the old comedy 

188.97 195.13 B: and and some and some of the new like uh everybody loves raymond i think that is hilarious most of the time 

194.48 197.86 A: oh my dad loves that show i love it it's a great show 

197.69 204.21 B: but if you think about it it's a reality show i mean everyone can relate to it everybody's got a raymond in their family somewhere 

203.81 205.45 A: [laughter] 

204.47 208.07 B: you know and everybody's got mama mia in her in their family somewhere 

208.01 208.93 A: (( yeah )) 

208.08 209.92 B: i think that's what makes it funny 

210.10 214.48 B: that everyone can like oh you're much too young to remember uh but 

214.79 216.05 B: archie bunker 

216.38 219.79 B: all in the family you may have seen reruns 

217.21 218.85 A: (( yeah i've seen it )) 

220.34 226.00 B: and in its day i mean it was it was the most controversial program on t._v. 

226.31 228.38 B: but yet it was one of the funniest 

229.14 236.21 B: because every- everyone could relate to it they they were subjects that nobody wanted to talk about in public because they were all taboo 

236.58 240.73 B: but yet everyone knew about it and you know he just brought it to light 

240.66 241.81 A: (( yeah that's )) 

240.98 242.95 B: like prejudice and 

243.27 246.83 B: uh um well that was his main one actually [laughter] 

246.49 250.31 A: [laughter] yeah and now like oh 

250.47 252.93 A: based on like prejudice i mean you see 

252.99 266.58 A: comics all the time like i mean watch comedy central you'll see like a mexican guy making fun of white people black people you see a black guy making fun of white guy white guy making fun of black guy it's just like the race card in comedy has been played 

263.55 264.42 B: right 

266.94 268.59 B: right well 

267.31 269.02 A: quite a few times too 

270.22 271.70 B: i i agree 

271.81 275.29 B: um and i disagree with some of it too i mean 

276.43 281.54 B: there are things that black people can say themselves but if someone else said you know it's a fight 

281.56 283.33 A: yeah 

282.40 283.94 B: i just 

283.48 285.84 A: that doesn't seem right either yeah i know 

285.16 288.48 B: (( no i think we're too hung up on words you know )) 

285.96 287.15 A: i know i def- 

289.41 290.49 A: definitely 

289.83 290.75 B: um 

292.42 297.50 B: i i i i don't quite understand it words are well that's all they are words 

298.25 303.86 B: there used to be a saying that sticks and stones will break my bones but names will never hurt me things have changed i mean 

303.66 304.60 A: [laughter] 

303.94 305.41 B: names start a fight you 

305.97 309.60 B: walk down the street and see a black guy and call him a nigger you're in trouble 

309.37 310.36 A: yeah 

310.38 312.86 B: but yet they can call themselves niggers 

313.47 315.73 B: and see that bothers me 

317.07 321.37 B: i'm caucasian but my heritage is native american you 

321.92 323.57 B: (( know and )) 

324.74 330.87 B: if i run into another native we're not calling each other red necks or 

330.81 331.82 A: yeah 

331.31 333.07 B: (( whatever so i )) 

332.87 338.87 A: and you wouldn't expect that either like i don't walk by another caucasian and say hey whitey what's up you know 

338.07 339.52 B: yeah exactly 

338.97 341.62 A: [laughter] or anything like that yeah it's 

341.41 342.93 B: (( no it's just uh )) 

342.04 344.70 A: well it's like it it seems different like 

344.77 351.84 A: like uh they don't want people to call them that but then they're calling each other it and it's just you know it contradicts itself 

351.54 354.24 B: i i agree and that bothers me 

354.32 361.04 A: and you even see that on t._v. now like comedy central the david chapelle show my friends love it i don't i don't watch it but 

361.06 364.48 A: and he uses that word and they don't edit it out at all 

364.37 366.70 B: (( no i know i )) 

366.12 367.43 A: it's i mean 

367.79 373.45 A: [mn] just he gets carried away and i think comedy will continue to get carried away i mean 

373.81 376.22 A: you're sixty three years old so you know like 

376.95 382.46 A: um how early on you know things weren't like this i mean 

382.88 385.79 A: you know they weren't this drastic and extreme 

382.96 389.32 B: know i absolutely know it just progress through the years and maybe digress i'm sure [laughter] 

388.56 391.06 A: oh yes see that's what i think too like 

391.38 395.37 A: first society like keeps you know like violent video games you know 

396.11 401.18 A: really like vulgar humor like i mean where are we going with this you know 

396.55 397.45 B: yeah 

401.22 403.62 A: and it's just gonna keep escalating 

403.62 411.45 B: i agree i mean i remember when uh george carlin said the seven words you can't say on t._v. and it was you know totally hilarious 

411.60 414.34 A: [laughter] 

411.97 418.60 B: but that was the beginning of it and then richard pryor came along and no holds barred with richard 

419.51 421.05 B: and it went on from there 

421.24 425.81 A: yeah and it just kept escalating and now you have like tom green and you have like 

422.85 423.90 B: right 

426.41 429.14 A: you have some pretty crazy comics i think 

428.21 429.39 B: (( yeah you do )) 

429.85 436.56 A: and it just gets it i don't know i i didn't mind that little switch it was kind of entertaining the 

437.10 442.12 A: the uh candid camera type switch you know where tom green like pulls pranks on people 

441.33 442.85 B: oh yeah yeah that's 

442.68 443.58 A: i didn't 

443.27 446.15 B: 'cause i go back to the days of the old candid camera you know 

445.53 446.63 A: yeah 

446.46 448.49 B: and and that was funny then 

449.27 459.24 B: because the comedy of of the fifties and sixties like i think is the best comedy there ever was but i'm probably prejudice because that was my days you 

460.03 464.87 B: know there was a lot of funny stuff on television and radio 

460.22 461.73 A: and it's kind of hard yeah 

465.52 469.46 A: it's it's kind of hard you know to switch because i mean i 

469.64 476.18 A: i'm sure what you found funny in the fifties i wouldn't find very funny now you know a lot of my environment kind of influence what i 

475.52 478.80 B: (( yeah but i'm not sure of that though )) 

479.06 482.51 B: my grandkids are are your age 

479.56 480.85 A: yeah there might just 

483.06 484.53 B: i've got um 

485.37 494.78 B: a twenty year old and a nine- eighteen year old and they'll watch i love lucy with me happy days with me and just 

494.86 495.79 B: roar 

496.39 497.59 B: (( because it was funny )) 

497.65 501.08 B: w- what was funny then is still funny now i think 

501.55 503.85 A: yeah i like like i like happy days 

501.83 504.83 B: and they don't like the vulgar comedy 

506.25 508.18 B: and they're not uh 

508.39 512.37 B: they're not what you would call prisses or whatever you call 

513.65 516.69 B: them they're into everything like m._t._v. and 

516.97 519.58 B: all the stuff but as far as comedy 

519.61 524.65 B: they'll watch the vulgar and they'll listen to their crap rap music which i totally hate 

524.26 526.24 A: o._h. i hate rap yeah [noise] 

525.57 530.29 B: you know they'll listen to that and a guy can say whatever he wants to say and 

530.45 533.97 B: they have no problem with that but as far as stand up 

535.30 540.15 B: down and out vulgar comedy [noise] they don't think it has a place 

540.61 547.25 B: but like i said they'll they'll sit there and watch the fifties stuff with me and and just you know roar 

547.37 548.80 B: (( like it's the ))

567.40 568.21 B: (( mhm )) 

568.13 575.09 A: and i mean like that's a scream i i like it too like some of the newer comedies like everybody loves raymond i like i like seinfeld 

575.69 576.85 A: i like like

578.07 585.97 A: there's i mean there are some comedies that i like i don't i'm not sure if uh network comedy shows are getting too bad yet 

586.07 589.37 B: there's not many of 'em left that are half way decent 

589.21 590.43 A: (( yeah i know ))
