0.02 3.47 B: okay my name is danny i live in tennessee 

2.89 5.72 A: hi uh my name is sri i'm from houston 

5.45 6.35 B: oh okay 

6.43 8.78 B: two two boys from the south then 

8.54 10.61 A: yeah i guess so [laughter] mhm 

9.40 12.76 B: yeah last time i talked to a guy in michigan i think 

13.06 14.17 B: um 

14.38 17.25 B: i don't know where do you draw the line that's the question 

17.08 29.48 A: oh i mean i guess i usually i usually t- tend to think that most thing i mean i i have a broader you know range of what's acceptable to me because you know i think as long as you're not hurting someone's feelings then 

24.73 25.74 B: yeah 

29.54 34.41 A: somebody as long as someone has a good sense of humor they can laugh at things um 

32.94 42.84 B: yeah [noise] okay um you're talking about when people interact yeah not not like watching it on t._v. or something 

39.20 40.97 A: yeah 

42.80 52.45 A: well i mean i guess like on t._v. i mean there's some things that you know people people tend to be politically correct about they're kind of sensitive like i don't know for example there's like a 

48.34 49.36 B: yeah 

52.96 65.25 A: like a i know uh shaq when shaq and yao ming were going to play against each other they had an interview with him and they asked if he wanted to say anything to yo ming and he's from china he's like yeah tell yo ming you know he 

61.96 62.82 B: yeah 

64.58 66.11 B: oh yeah yeah 

65.21 77.43 A: [laughter] he i mean he was you know made some sounds that sounded like chinese like i didn't think that there's anything really offensive about it but a lot of people you know a lot of chinese americans got really upset and people were calling in saying that but i guess 

68.88 69.70 B: oh 

74.91 84.32 B: oh yeah no i wouldn't find that offensive i in fact i can see the humor in that um so but um 

80.64 82.45 A: yeah 

84.64 88.11 B: yeah i'm kind of i'm kind of the same way you are as long as 

88.13 102.60 B: as long as you're not being offensive to a a race or um a particular group of people um i've noticed uh uh like uh for instance black comedians among themselves they don't seem to have any problem with it 

99.12 100.79 A: mhm 

102.30 104.02 A: yeah 

102.97 112.33 B: but they don't want anybody you know of a different race to say some of the same things that they say and i c- i've always found that double standard a little bit strange 

112.19 125.60 A: yeah well i mean it's like acceptable because you know you're you've been the persecuted group but like if jerry seinfeld went around and said do you ever notice how black people always do this or that you know then people would you know i mean he would he'd catch hell and pay for it you know 

120.34 121.14 B: yeah 

123.83 126.93 B: yeah right right he would yeah 

125.82 132.72 A: but i mean chris rock can go around and talk about how white people do this and white people do that because you know he's the oppressed group not the oppressor 

131.58 133.10 B: yeah right yeah that's 

133.13 136.54 B: kinda strange the way that that standard works 

136.67 139.90 B: but um are you are you a student 

139.58 145.45 A: um well i i just graduated yeah but i've been a student for a while yeah yeah 

141.78 142.83 B: oh okay 

144.00 149.00 B: yeah that's sounds good um and um 

147.48 149.19 A: yeah 

149.35 156.93 B: on this humor thing um i guess when it gets on a personal level i guess that's when i would have to draw the line 

156.80 158.55 A: yeah 

157.48 159.22 B: so um 

160.23 166.08 B: other than that i didn't i'm not i'm kinda like you it takes a lot for me to be offended uh 

166.44 169.22 B: in that respect so 

168.54 171.79 A: yeah i i mean i think the jokes that probably 

171.78 182.38 A: strike me as kind of offensive as ones that imply that certain people are i don't know like they're inferior or stupid or something like that you know like the the people always act that way i mean some of 

179.23 180.99 B: (( yeah )) 

182.39 196.20 A: i mean it's really a fine line though whether you're making fun of that type of joke or whether you're actually like believe that thing yourself and you have to kind of know the people that you're with like the same kind of joke i would make with a stranger might be offensive and then i might make it to a friend and because they don't 

194.60 199.61 B: oh sure well that's true yeah that's true yeah i hadn't thought about that that is true 

196.31 197.20 A: (( you know )) 

199.31 208.89 A: yeah i mean i i like to tell a good you know i like to tell like you know dirty jokes or sometimes you know racist or you know like a joke about an irishman or a frenchman or you know whatever 

199.65 200.54 B: yeah 

203.75 204.68 B: yeah 

207.06 208.30 B: yeah 

208.73 216.87 A: and sometimes when i when i tell jokes like that i'm just telling it 'cause it's you know it's it's a funny joke and people people get offended because i guess they 

213.57 215.09 B: yeah right 

216.79 224.74 A: if they don't know you well enough and they're thinking like oh you know like how can you talk about other people that way well i don't really believe that that's why it's a joke you know 

224.00 234.63 B: yeah yeah right yeah yeah yeah but that's just kind of add to the humor of it of the kind of like it's preposterous to even think about and that's what makes it funny 

225.37 226.20 A: (( [laughter] )) 

229.26 230.87 A: yeah 

234.47 243.84 A: yeah exactly like there's this uh there's this t._v. show on uh comedy central called strangers with candy and they would they'd go out of their way to be politically incorrect you know i mean like 

235.64 236.32 B: yeah 

243.66 248.99 A: they had a whole episode about racism where you know they were find you know and punish this kid who wrote 

248.78 261.14 A: this bad word i mean it started it was like n. i. g. and then it was you could never see the end of the world you know but but the whole episode like everybody was talking about you know we we're gonna find out who wrote this racist word whether it's the k- you know the 

253.32 254.71 B: oh okay 

260.94 263.36 A: chinks the kikes the the spics whatever 

261.96 264.06 B: oh [laughter] yeah 

263.13 276.00 A: and so they were all you know being racist as they were [laughter] trying to find this racist person and that's that's the kind of humor that really you know makes me laugh is when people make fun of you know the the stereotypes uh you know 

265.73 266.58 B: yeah 

267.75 269.82 B: (( hm )) 

275.02 276.00 B: yeah 

276.24 282.51 B: yeah yeah i guess that's what made do you ever see a you're pretty young but did you ever see archie bunker 

282.32 285.06 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

283.06 289.70 B: yeah that was the whole premise of that show is is uh i guess is that uh prejudism is uh 

290.53 293.77 B: so ridiculous it's it's funny sometimes 

293.84 297.96 A: yeah exactly i mean we're making fun of ourselves like it's kinda like the you know the 

296.04 297.20 B: yeah 

297.75 310.71 A: the ralph crampton or the archie bunker or the homer simpson these are like you know this is kind of the base level of you know american society and like okay we all i mean we all have faults and flaws and this is us making fun of our own culture that way you know 

300.58 301.64 B: yeah 

303.54 304.36 B: yeah 

304.47 305.58 B: yeah 

309.43 310.44 B: yeah 

310.74 324.24 B: yeah it's kinda like i can call myself a dumb ass but don't you do it [laughter] so you know because uh then then i find it offensive but as long as i'm saying it i don't find it offensive but 

314.40 318.34 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

323.44 331.77 A: yeah i mean like i gotta i guess like i i wouldn't mind someone calling you know me a dumb ass but if somebody calls my brother a dumb ass that's not okay 

329.94 335.73 B: yeah right yeah yeah i know what you mean i know exactly what you mean i got brothers too 

331.93 333.65 A: yeah 

335.91 340.33 B: and uh i get uh very v- defensive very quick so 

337.81 340.76 A: yeah 

341.12 352.32 A: oh especially like i mean if you think if you think that they're saying it because like not for a joke but just saying just as an insult something like for example if somebody you know if i called one of my friends a dumb ass when i know he's really smart whereas 

351.77 352.65 B: yeah 

352.18 358.88 A: somebody who's you know like retarded or something you know and you started making fun of the way he talks then that's not in good taste because 

354.84 356.04 B: yeah 

356.07 357.30 B: yeah 

358.04 361.17 B: no that's true yeah that's right 

359.50 363.47 A: you're you're just putting him down for something that he can't really control you know 

362.70 366.55 B: yeah yeah you're right yeah that's true 

366.63 367.57 B: um 

368.99 370.06 B: i um 

372.15 385.62 B: i tend to not i like to read jokes but i don't tell 'em very often and i don't know if it's because i don't feel comfortable uh presenting it um i don't have any problem printing one out and giving it to somebody i guess i'm afraid of my presentation 

380.40 382.19 A: mhm 

383.25 385.21 A: (( yeah )) 

385.43 387.68 A: yeah [laughter] 

385.91 393.55 B: as much as anything i'm afraid i'll because i told some i told a joke one day to some guys down at work and they're college students 

393.91 403.87 B: and uh well what the joke was i told 'em about saddam hussein uh his one of his advisors came into his doubles 

398.99 399.93 A: uh-huh 

403.49 404.61 A: yeah 

403.95 410.83 B: all of his doubles you've probably heard this and uh they said we've got good news and bad news saddam hussein's still alive 

410.67 412.35 A: yeah 

411.09 416.12 B: and they said what's the bad news and he said the guy said well he lost his arm 

416.31 423.05 B: which means all his doubles gotta get their arm cut off you know and it those college guys didn't get it and uh 

418.46 420.30 A: [laughter] oh 

421.79 423.54 A: yeah 

423.49 429.69 B: i i i think it was the way i presented it i don't i they didn't first of all they didn't realize it was a joke 

429.35 430.62 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

429.74 438.58 B: they thought i was serious and uh but i think a lot of it's in the telling and even even on t._v. i think that's true 

438.43 442.45 A: yeah i mean that joke that joke could definitely i mean 

438.71 441.06 B: uh the way they present it 

442.41 455.08 A: you can present it but i don't think it would be too offensive either way but like i don't know like uh i mean one one of the guys i was working on this movie you know a couple of weeks ago or i mean actually during the war and um 

445.78 446.94 B: oh no 

454.90 463.93 A: and i asked somebody like you know like whether it was supposed to be a hot day like i don't know but the weather forecast for baghdad is about a thousand degrees and for me that was just like 

462.47 463.56 B: oh yeah 

463.90 465.11 B: yeah 

464.46 468.46 A: i mean i didn't really it it wasn't really too funny for me because it was like 

467.36 468.53 B: yeah 

468.26 479.75 A: he was basically saying uh-huh these guys are gonna all be burning and dying [laughter] like that wasn't it wasn't as much a joke as it was just like uh making fun of somebody because they're in a bad situation you know 

471.80 473.94 B: yeah yeah 

478.92 483.47 B: yeah yeah i i get what you're coming from [noise] yeah that makes sense 

481.54 483.21 A: yeah 

483.57 490.57 B: but uh yeah i i don't know some people seems like when they do tell you something their their whole intent is to to uh 

490.76 491.83 B: (( uh )) 

492.82 495.79 B: um in- insult you or offend you 

496.12 498.81 B: you know like don rickles he's a good example 

498.92 500.47 B: you ever seen him 

500.45 502.73 A: oh yeah yeah 

501.12 514.97 B: okay i mean his his whole thing is is insulting people i mean that's from and and some of it i do find offensive because he because he gets personal with it and i don't care for that too much 

512.24 513.91 A: yeah 

514.26 525.93 A: yeah like on andrew dice clay or somebody like that yeah well maybe that i mean then you know when you go into it the whole point is that he's trying to put it so far out there that i mean it's kind of like 

515.95 519.25 B: yeah right right exactly yeah i guess 

525.73 537.90 A: it's almost funny that someone would say something like that because you're not supposed to say something like that it's not that he really believes it necessarily it's just that he going beyond what what is supposed to be allowed you know that's all 

531.78 533.09 B: yeah 

536.41 538.81 B: yeah right 

537.95 545.54 A: i mean it's it's a fine line i mean it it just it really depends on the audience and the and the person telling the joke i think 

544.43 556.01 B: i think so too y- y- you kind of got a and that's like most any comedian would tell you you have to you have to uh modify your work what you're gonna present to the crowd you've got to work with 

556.52 563.14 B: you know so one joke that you that that a comedian might tell to one group of people he might not tell to another one 

563.78 568.71 B: um if you know if he was on stage do you understand what i mean 

567.19 578.66 A: yeah well yeah i mean it's it's an interaction and so i mean you know that's what a good comedian does is he gauges what's working and what's not working and if you're a bad comedian you'll just keep telling the same jokes [laughter] 

570.28 571.53 B: right 

571.58 572.43 B: yeah 

574.06 574.91 B: yeah 

577.38 579.43 B: that's right yeah 

578.71 589.27 A: no matter what the audience does but if you're a good comedian you'll re- like johnny carson he was really good at that like when when his jokes would fall flat he could react to it and make fun of himself so that everybody keeps laughing you know 

583.24 584.37 B: yeah 

588.49 593.66 B: oh yeah yeah he was good yeah he was real good as a matter of fact 

590.75 592.48 A: yeah 

593.31 594.92 A: (( yeah )) 

594.27 595.58 B: (( so [noise] um )) 

596.79 599.37 B: this has been an interesting conversation 

598.94 599.89 A: yeah i mean 

599.42 599.89 B: (( uh ))
