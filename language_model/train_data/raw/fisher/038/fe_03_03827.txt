0.54 2.67 A: [lipsmack] hi my name is samantha 

2.33 4.50 B: hi i'm kathleen 

4.37 5.26 A: hi 

5.27 6.34 A: [laughter] 

5.37 6.56 B: hi 

6.85 7.87 A: um 

7.35 12.31 B: [sigh] okay well um bad taste um 

12.71 18.29 B: [lipsmack] i don't really find ah foul language in ah comedy 

18.34 19.45 B: funny 

20.28 24.91 B: ah it seems like sometimes people use a lot of bad language 

24.95 26.61 B: um because 

25.70 28.09 A: and it doesn't get the point across any better 

27.03 32.24 B: yeah exactly because they have a limited vocabulary and it's every other word 

28.89 29.76 A: yeah 

30.61 31.57 A: yeah 

31.67 38.14 A: in- yeah instead of looking up something in the thesaurus that might [laughter] be more appropriate yeah they just 

34.70 35.89 B: [laughter] or 

36.13 39.26 B: yeah or being more descriptive or articulate 

38.25 41.96 A: yeah say the f. word because that makes it known to everybody 

41.62 45.90 B: yeah i mean i think ah i think you know sometimes it ah 

42.12 43.41 A: yeah i agree 

46.08 53.10 B: um it reflects real life and that's good but i don't i don't like it to be just every sentence has profanity in it 

52.59 54.13 A: right no i agree 

53.08 62.34 B: or vulgarity and so um [lipsmack] there's a comedy club here where i i live and i it's gotten so that um 

54.75 55.63 A: right 

62.48 68.18 B: ah you know i i check on the comics the headliner that they're having and um 

68.24 77.58 B: you know if they say it's ah you know it's got a lot of vulgarity or profanity in it i just don't bother because i don't find that funny 

74.69 76.22 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

77.48 80.61 A: [mn] i um i also don't like 

81.49 83.14 A: um racial 

83.28 90.27 A: slurs and and that type of thing i just i don't think there's any you know what makes whoever's making the joke 

86.67 87.91 B: yeah 

90.85 96.61 A: think that they're superior to whoever they're making derogatory comments about 

92.59 98.14 B: [noise] yeah you don't see much of that any more most because most people won't stand for that 

97.85 100.50 A: yeah i did say i've heard a i 

98.20 99.38 B: yeah 

100.53 114.85 A: was listening to some radio station the other morning and they were saying some some nasty things and i just i turned it 'cause i thought that's not necessary you know you can you can talk about you know a certain you know ethnicity of people without using 

115.50 120.69 A: bad bad words [laughter] i don't want my kids saying those words so i don't want it you know even on 

116.54 117.54 B: yeah 

120.59 123.07 B: it's interesting yeah um 

121.85 122.75 A: yeah 

123.19 125.21 B: i g- and and so um 

126.24 128.92 B: [lipsmack] yeah and i've seen um 

129.07 136.51 B: that you know there's one thing to ah you know make ah you know make fun of people by 

136.60 145.52 B: exaggerating characteristics or whatever but i've seen some comedians that are very disrespectful about women 

139.86 140.91 A: yeah 

145.38 146.56 A: yes 

145.93 151.20 B: and i would put that in your same category about racial slurs 

148.83 149.76 A: mhm 

150.85 151.82 A: yeah 

151.22 152.40 B: um 

152.44 157.90 B: it's ah it's offensive and it's prejudiced and it i mean it's just not funny 

157.49 164.47 A: no it's and it's not doing anybody any good and i mean you know it doesn't i mean it doesn't make me laugh 

160.48 161.52 B: yeah 

164.28 165.27 B: yeah 

164.64 174.64 A: so i don't i mean and if people are laughing i think it's more because they're uncomfortable with what was just said and it's kind of a defense mechanism as opposed to they really thought it was funny 

167.72 168.67 B: yeah 

172.18 173.45 B: and i like 

174.01 177.30 B: and i like your idea too in that um 

177.39 185.49 B: um you know we're we're we're adults um you know if it's offensive turn the t._v. station turn the radio 

185.27 186.18 A: yeah 

185.48 196.97 B: you know they won't get advertisers because of and the same with the comedy club you know i've left and you know and told management you know i just don't find this funny you know that 

188.53 189.64 A: exactly 

194.81 200.96 A: yeah i won't be back and and that's what gets through is i'm taking my business away because that is 

197.69 207.33 B: exactly i think yeah i think the worst thing you can do is just sit there and be embarrassed or sit there and just wait for it to be over 

205.64 207.06 A: and accept it 

207.09 208.09 A: yeah 

207.42 213.54 B: yeah it's the same with anything in life that's offensive not just comedy you know 

211.49 212.41 A: mhm 

212.93 225.52 A: yeah i just i think that there's there's just not there doesn't seem to be a line any more i mean and maybe maybe that's not a good thing and i don't mean it to be like things should be censored i mean 

225.28 226.37 B: yeah 

225.73 237.61 A: but i mean it used to be that comedy you know you watch old i love lucy reruns and it was funny just because she was such a goober about things [laughter] she was just such a dork and 

230.56 231.63 B: right 

234.73 240.85 B: yeah and it w- and it was a lot of physical comedy but it was her yeah yeah 

238.55 249.63 A: yeah i mean and and now you know you've got these things where it's got to be funny because you know i can say the f. word fourteen times in a minute and one sentence or 

246.77 247.70 B: yeah 

249.64 255.52 A: or you know i can i can cut down everybody in this this row with 

255.55 264.25 A: a a comment and it's just i don't think that that's funny i mean i like like clean humor i mean that makes me laugh a whole lot more than 

256.11 257.99 B: insults yeah 

261.69 271.06 B: yeah i think that the other place where i draw the line is ah n- nastiness or um 

271.13 272.15 B: um 

272.19 274.38 B: really hurting people 

274.07 280.83 A: yeah where you just it cuts to the bone and you're just like wow that wasn't that wasn't funny and it wasn't necessary 

274.84 275.84 B: you know 

278.37 279.71 B: exactly 

280.48 292.64 B: i saw this interview with a a writer for david letterman and i thought it was real interesting saying that um they drew the line at they could make fun of a what what a person did 

284.03 284.88 A: mhm 

292.28 293.25 A: mhm 

292.51 297.05 B: because if this politician you know chose to say something stupid 

296.71 297.79 A: right 

297.13 308.36 B: in public well that's different but they wouldn't make fun of ah how they looked or what religion they were or where they were raised you know because that was 

305.24 306.22 A: mhm 

307.49 309.31 A: they can't do anything about that 

308.41 318.10 B: that was them and it wasn't anything you know that's why you know short jokes and bald jokes are so stupid because you know it doesn't take any creativity or wit 

310.63 311.44 A: right 

317.35 321.20 A: right well you know sometimes i think people are just 

318.21 319.39 B: to do that 

321.51 327.83 A: you know they're doing the cut downs because they can't think of anything funny that's really funny 

324.80 326.02 B: mhm 

327.80 338.60 A: to say and so it's just it's like do we wanna turn the mirror and look at you i mean 'cause this guy may be short and bald but you're you know fat and [laughter] you know you 

328.68 329.88 B: it's easy 

337.45 339.84 B: [laughter] yeah and it's 

338.53 352.55 A: know i mean you don't want that said about you so don't say it about i mean you know but back to the old rule of you don't want somebody you know being nasty to you you know treat others be do unto others as you should have them do unto you you know and i just i don't know mhm 

340.58 341.89 B: exactly 

349.19 350.91 B: yeah 

351.20 357.80 B: but i you know i think lots of ah you know one thing where i where i appreciate is um 

357.75 370.43 B: there are lots of comedians like on t._v. on the those talk shows or whatever who hold ah public officials and public decisions up to scrutiny and i think that's perfectly fine 

367.91 368.92 A: yeah 

370.45 374.74 B: now some people say you you know you shouldn't make jokes about the president because 

374.65 375.87 A: but he he 

375.22 384.14 B: of the office he holds but i'm going like no i mean you know if he makes stupid comments then you know that's perfectly acceptable so 

380.52 381.54 A: right 

383.05 392.58 A: well and he took that that job or that position knowing that he was gonna be in the public's eye and totally scrutinized over everything he said and so people 

386.36 387.37 B: knowing 

392.46 397.09 A: laugh at it well then he's gotta expect that or you know make fun of him for it 

395.12 396.17 B: yeah 

396.97 410.53 A: you know and and you know it's different like you said when they make fun of his person like oh he's you know catholic or jewish or mormon that's different than saying [mn] can you believe what he said about you know whatever 

398.99 399.91 B: well i me- 

405.66 406.94 B: that's different 

407.14 408.27 B: yeah 

409.66 422.34 B: yeah oh and even making fun of ah the war in iraq or the french or you know whatever you know that i think that's perfectly fine it brings light to 

416.80 417.73 A: mhm 

422.53 430.66 B: some of these you know public events and helps people to put them in perspective you know not everything has to be so serious 

427.41 428.31 A: yeah 

431.74 445.31 A: [noise] yeah i agree well and you know the one thing about the war though is i have a brother in law that's over there and i just i get really offensive with people when they when they start we shouldn't be over there and and you know start cutting it down like that 

438.10 439.30 B: mhm 

443.90 445.31 B: well that's hard 

445.08 448.87 A: and because it's just hard on a personal level and i mean 

447.69 450.50 B: it's real hard yeah to be 

449.16 458.15 A: but i understand people use humor as a defense too 'cause i mean they may have a brother over there and they're just trying to trying to to cope with it somehow 

453.63 454.72 B: sure 

458.17 461.36 B: yeah it's hard because you want to be supportive 

461.27 474.06 B: of the individuals and the people but you might not support the public policy the military policy yeah and and humor is one way of kind of dealing with those differences 

464.28 465.21 A: yeah 

465.77 466.68 A: right 

466.79 467.83 A: right 

468.47 470.55 A: yeah that's that's true 

473.39 475.05 A: i know yeah um 

475.44 476.98 A: [laughter] 

477.11 480.29 B: [laughter] okay have you done this before 

478.43 479.55 A: okay 

479.89 482.09 A: um this is only my second one 

481.49 483.71 B: (( okay mine too but still it's like )) 

482.65 495.70 A: yeah [laughter] so the last the last one i did was just talking about pets and it was really hard 'cause we were i mean everything was very forced and this this conversation's been a lot more natural [laughter] 'cause 

492.33 502.64 B: [laughter] [laughter] well they called me the other day and wanted me to talk about huts i'm pretty sure that's what she said and i said no [laughter] i go like 

501.62 502.86 A: huts 

502.69 510.46 B: huts that's what it sounded like h. u. t. s. and i'm knowing like huts i don't think so [laughter] 

504.44 505.30 A: oh 

506.13 507.54 A: o- okay 

509.13 514.49 A: i called in yesterday 'cause i had missed their call and they wanted me to talk about minimum wage and i'm thinking 

514.12 515.17 B: okay 

514.66 516.94 A: i don't want to talk about minimum wage [laughter] 

516.02 518.51 B: well i did that yesterday and it was fine 

517.59 519.68 A: did you was it not too bad 

519.05 524.82 B: no yeah 'cause you know the guy i was talking to was unemployed [laughter] so he had lots of opinions 

519.93 520.79 A: yeah 

522.67 523.52 A: oh 

524.22 526.69 A: yeah so that's that's good [laughter] 

525.02 534.35 B: okay now you ask me now i don't know ah [mn] but it's pretty hard for me to talk ten minutes about anything and so see here we are wandering off topic [laughter] 

531.19 542.92 A: i know especially with somebody you don't know [laughter] it said you have to talk eight minutes about the topic and you know 'cause they i think they expect a little bird tracking up you know around other things but um 

540.39 541.43 B: yeah 

541.85 543.29 B: so um 

542.94 553.73 A: you know um talking about humor though is some of these commercials that are on t._v. now and they're supposed to be funny i think [laughter] and i just i don't get them um 

551.41 552.62 B: like what 

553.95 566.16 A: well let's see this one is a while ago but it was what was it i think it was like a a volkswagen commercial and these two college looking age guys are driving around and they pick up this stinky green chair 

566.58 572.23 A: and then they drop it off a few blocks later 'cause it stunk and then they kept driving i did not get 

571.59 572.87 B: i don't get it 

572.54 580.96 A: where that was supposed to be funny or i mean 'cause i i think funny [noise] was how it was supposed to be portrayed and i i just didn't get it 

580.90 582.42 B: or it didn't fit 

582.30 585.41 A: yeah it just you know and some of them it's just like 

585.38 599.89 A: you know some of their humor and it's like like have you heard the ah the jingle for goldfish crackers you know they've all got a smile on their face until you bite their heads off [laughter] and i'm just it kinda makes me laugh but i'm like that's kinda vicious i mean 

591.81 592.87 B: no 

594.80 596.61 B: [laughter] okay
