1.29 2.43 B: hello 

2.15 4.47 A: hello i'm linda sanders 

4.07 6.15 B: hi i'm angela how are you 

5.88 7.84 A: i'm doing fine angela 

7.73 14.76 B: did did you catch all of the topic i heard how do you distinguish between acceptable comedy and something else 

14.66 18.88 A: and well comedy and bad taste or something like that 

17.62 22.95 B: oh okay [laughter] okay well any thoughts about that 

19.55 20.49 A: [laughter] 

22.29 36.48 A: well uh [laughter] there is a a probably a fine line because i know in some of the movies that i've watched the the comedy movies some of them are really good but some of them are in bad taste in the way they insinuate things 

35.89 39.06 B: yeah well yeah and i think that uh 

39.31 41.54 B: i mean a lot of cases it's 

41.62 45.67 B: i guess something that one person considers bad taste somebody else may not or 

45.53 57.89 B: like i know i i have a friend who you know she only will go to movies that will pretty much rated g. and you know and i like things that sometimes are a little bit [laughter] more racy or something and you know but she thinks that that's 

53.88 55.28 A: yeah me too 

57.85 68.71 B: in bad taste so i think it's i i i guess i question that you can even clearly define it because i think it's something that you know each person has to kind of decide for themselves 

68.12 70.87 A: yes i agree i have a sister who 

69.48 70.20 B: (( you )) 

70.74 83.60 A: who won't watch like shrek because she says it's a dirty movie because of some of the insinuations but then she'll watch a a different type of movie that i find that is really you know kind of 

78.32 79.16 B: know 

83.80 94.15 A: off the wall type stuff and yet she'll watch it so it's like like you said i think it's just and your your or perception and exactly um 

85.08 86.16 B: right 

94.37 98.77 A: what your idea of what is off the wall and what is not 

98.30 108.14 B: yeah yeah i would agree i think i guess i think a lot of people feel like kind of that line is crossed the stuff that gets into stuff that is too sexual in nature or 

108.20 112.89 B: um if it's comedy that has like a lot of cursing in it or something 

112.39 113.69 A: mhm 

113.26 122.18 B: you know i think there's some of those things that you know that i guess for a lot of people it's obvious that they they don't like at kind of stuff but then 

122.38 127.70 B: you know obviously there are people that that feel like i said i think about like um 

128.00 129.89 B: um what's that comedian um 

129.82 131.34 B: martin lawrence 

131.22 132.37 A: mhm 

131.28 145.43 B: um i don't know if you've ever seen anything he's done i you know to me he's he's too extreme but yet i know he's very famous and you know so obviously there are people that like him and don't think that there is anything inappropriate about his comedy i mean 

145.49 148.22 B: these people that are acceptable to and 

148.31 153.60 B: but that's one that wouldn't be acceptable to me so i don't want to listen to 

152.12 152.96 A: yeah 

153.07 154.00 A: well i know 

154.19 165.08 A: you know when he was younger in his you know doing his comedy and stuff and you know he had a lot of insinuations and stuff and people just you know during the air just thought he was fabulous 

164.80 166.10 B: mhm 

164.85 169.84 A: but yet it seemed when i would listen to him it was like he was just too vulgar for me 

169.44 170.56 B: mhm 

169.94 180.50 A: but yet you know adults just thought he was wonderful of course i was a young teenager but but it was like you know i found him offensive for a lot of people didn't so 

179.80 181.18 B: yeah 

180.58 184.12 A: it's just you just don't ever know anymore 

183.57 186.74 B: yeah yeah you don't know how anybody is going to respond 

186.05 197.07 A: i know it cause what you think which people which respond to one thing they they really like it and you know and then they respond to something else and it's like how can you like that kind of stuff 

196.64 197.76 B: yeah 

197.95 200.50 B: i know i've been surprised like i watch um 

200.68 208.29 B: will and grace um on t._v. and i've i've been surprised that like that to me actually i 

208.50 219.48 B: i'm surprised because i still enjoy it but i'm surprised that it's it's on network t._v. because i mean they you know they do make a lot of you know insinuations and sexual related stuff and 

219.52 221.05 B: sometimes i just 

221.30 228.67 B: am amazed that [laughter] people don't object to more you know cause like i was watching it one time recently and um 

229.25 232.39 B: i those girl grace was um 

232.82 245.85 B: i i don't remember what the context was but one of the other females on the show like pointed at her breasts and said something about do those things move cause she's kind of small chested [laughter] and i was just so you know i was just kind of amazed that 

241.22 246.91 A: (( wow [laughter] [laughter] i can't believe it )) 

246.22 257.39 B: [laughter] that it was very funny just the way cause she was trying to get grace to dance that's what it was she was trying to get her to dance and she said something like okay you know shake your groove thing and some other you know 

248.34 250.25 A: (( [laughter] )) 

256.92 259.17 A: [laughter] 

257.88 266.76 B: um saying for dancing and then she just kind of looks at her chest and you know cause she's talking about something about moving and after that [laughter] and like 

262.71 264.21 A: [laughter] 

264.45 266.62 A: [laughter] 

266.52 281.48 B: i was surprised that it seemed like something that probably a lot of people would think was inappropriate especially for network t._v. and i was just kind of surprised that they actually put it on that and but i think all of the i guess all of the t._v. shows i think are getting more 

281.61 282.69 B: you know what 

283.08 288.30 B: obviously what's acceptable today i'm sure wouldn't of been acceptable twenty or thirty years ago [laughter] 

287.97 299.25 A: that's true that is very true cause if they had done something like that immediately it would of been okay we're not going to watch this this not going to be on the air this is what we want to get rid of you know 

289.05 290.24 B: yeah 

296.27 297.30 B: yeah 

299.38 303.54 A: so but there a little more liberal today than they than you know than they used to be 

303.00 304.09 B: yeah 

304.32 307.47 B: yeah and if you look at you know like sometimes on like uh 

307.78 313.58 B: the brady bunch or something on one of the you know channels and you see you know the [laughter] 

309.81 311.06 A: mhm 

313.60 319.39 B: everything is just so totally different and so much like g. rated comedy compared to 

319.49 321.25 B: to what you see today 

320.91 335.59 A: oh yeah oh yeah did a scene a a person any part of their body other than their arms [noise] and legs you know it was like it was taboo and then now it's like there's nothing to go walk around nude 

321.72 322.46 B: [laughter] 

331.09 332.17 B: yeah 

335.04 336.24 B: yeah 

336.54 338.22 B: yeah that's very true 

337.97 339.36 A: yeah 

339.69 345.50 B: but yeah i think i think each person has to just kind of figure out for themselves what they're comfortable with and probably 

345.71 350.60 B: at least make some mistakes of trying some things out to see [laughter] you 

349.51 351.64 A: yeah because really i 

350.92 352.37 B: are not going to know 

352.04 361.84 A: exactly cause i'm the type of person that you know i like a lot of the [noise] the walt disney type movies and stuff but then i'll also like to watch robo cop 

357.85 359.03 B: mhm 

361.76 362.84 B: [laughter] 

361.91 373.26 A: and i like to watch robin hood you know with kevin costner you know so i like different kinds of a variety of of movie type things and some are a little more risky and some of them are not 

364.00 364.92 B: uh-huh 

369.84 370.85 B: yeah 

372.60 373.68 B: yeah 

373.87 383.07 A: but yet i think you know if you look at everything in a in a good context then you know sometimes they just don't you can over look a lot of things 

382.46 383.48 B: (( hm )) 

383.40 387.01 A: and i think that's what a lot of people have done anymore just so that they 

387.42 390.92 A: they can enjoy the movie and just kind of over look a lot of things 

390.52 391.60 B: yeah 

392.22 399.24 B: yeah just blow off the the parts that that might bother them or might potentially offend them and 

396.51 397.74 A: exactly 

398.94 400.23 A: (( [noise] exactly )) 

400.37 405.10 B: i think too that a lot of people if they if they look too rigidly at it 

405.04 416.57 B: i think they end up missing out on some things cause like my friend and i mentioned who's you know is pretty she's pretty ridged about what she will go see at the movies and stuff and you know there there are times that like i think she 

416.74 426.70 B: ends up missing out on things because of that [laughter] you know because she says i mean i one of my very favorite movies is the movie the bird cage and 

420.12 421.40 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

425.92 427.23 A: yes 

426.86 437.99 B: i sat down with her one time to watch it and because she has a problem with homosexuality she just like you could tell was so uncomfortable throughout the whole movie and you know wasn't able to 

437.91 447.78 B: enjoy the comedy that you know there's certainly lots of comedy in there that isn't related to homosexuality just related to funny stuff but you know she was 

443.25 444.89 A: exactly 

447.19 450.27 A: well to me that that's like taking like uh 

451.07 452.06 B: mhm 

451.32 453.92 A: you know who used to be uh ellen's partner 

453.50 454.66 B: yeah 

454.04 459.73 A: you know and and i love to watch her movies because she is just fabulous as an actress 

456.39 457.45 B: yeah 

459.14 460.61 B: yeah she is 

459.78 466.44 A: you know i don't approve of her style but you know but i love to watch her as an actress because she is just great 

465.76 466.89 B: yeah 

466.81 472.36 A: i mean she can take any part and just just just make is hers 

471.68 472.80 B: yeah 

472.41 474.63 A: and it's just really fabulous 

474.59 483.32 B: yeah so if you if you decide based on one thing that you don't like that you're not going to [laughter] not going to pay attention to that person or something you'd miss out on some good movies 

482.82 486.04 A: yes definitely yes i agree 

486.43 488.00 A: it's it's 

489.28 492.08 A: it's kind of strange sometimes because you see people 

492.15 501.19 A: like that that just automatically close their mind and they don't want to see this you know and because of this and that and yet you're looking at such a fabulous 

495.91 496.96 B: yeah 

501.36 502.43 B: yeah 

503.70 517.24 B: yeah that you definitely end up missing out on good stuff cause yeah like i said that was my experience with my friend was i mean i knew before we sat down to watch the movie you know i knew what her feelings were about homosexuality and and you know but i told her i said it's still a funny movie you know [laughter] 

516.94 523.85 A: movie look at the movie don't break it down don't don't dissect it just watch the movie 

517.98 519.00 B: yeah 

522.05 523.09 B: yeah 

523.36 530.29 B: yeah but she was just couldn't get passed that that it was about gay guys [laughter] and just so she just wasn't able to enjoy it 

529.99 536.97 A: have you seen the movie with uh patrick swayze and um i can't remember who the other people are but where he plays the female 

537.52 539.67 B: oh yeah yeah 

539.25 550.95 A: okay i love it i never realised that he would play a part like that and and my daughter called me one day and she said mum you've got to watch this movie patrick swayze is great as a female and it's like excuse me 

539.72 540.86 B: yeah 

542.88 544.25 B: [laughter] 

547.85 549.08 B: [laughter] 

550.22 551.49 B: [laughter] 

551.04 555.72 A: (( i love him as a man i don't know if i want to see him as a woman but he's fabulous in that )) 

554.91 556.07 B: yeah 

556.34 560.95 A: you know and yes sure there's a lot of innuendos in it but he's fabulous 

556.43 557.32 B: yeah 

560.15 564.55 B: yeah that's true that's yeah that's a good example yeah and those were a few 

564.61 569.54 B: if you said okay i don't like the idea of people cross dressing i'm not going to watch the movie you'd miss out on a 

569.30 571.91 A: exactly cause it's a wonderful movie 

569.55 571.09 B: really good movie 

572.56 573.94 A: it is great 

574.50 577.53 A: this is neat though i've never done this before i like this 

577.06 585.20 B: yeah me neither this is i just signed up yesterday this is the first time i've done anything like this and it's an interesting topic [laughter] 

582.77 587.62 A: yeah i signed up yesterday too [laughter] i think 

585.42 586.33 B: [laughter] 

586.68 594.09 B: yeah it's interesting topic i i don't know if they expect a clear cut answer from us cause [laughter] we're not getting one 

592.52 596.79 A: it's wonderful [laughter] we have a clear cut answer [laughter] 

595.09 599.26 B: [laughter] the clear cut answer is that you can't define it okay [laughter] 

598.31 599.95 A: you really can't because
