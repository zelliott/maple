89.43 90.39 B: (( mhm )) 

96.08 107.03 A: you know and like meaning like it's directed at them then i don't think then that's particularly funny but but if you're if it's in passing or

107.09 118.86 A: you know if you're just at a party and someone happens to mention a fat joke then you know there are fat jokes there are skinny joke there's black jokes there's white jokes i mean you know everybody has to be a part of a joke at some point

123.51 124.69 A: mhm 

123.84 127.62 B: but that's because it's so colorful and there's so um 

127.67 140.16 B: it's such a strong culture you know like i'm norwegian you know american norwegian there's hardly any there's like some norwegian jokes but i would it wouldn't bother me if someone told a joke but if they said something kind of nasty 

129.35 130.96 A: mhm 

140.48 145.33 B: that wouldn't be funny to me i to me if it's about me i don't think it's funny i guess 

145.51 153.71 A: right well i'm i'm like i see the funny side in things and especially being english there's a lot of like english jokes 

149.72 150.55 B: mhm 

153.44 154.34 B: mhm 

153.65 165.62 A: i don't you know people are always like oh you're the english the food is so bad and have bad taste and i'm like have you ever been to england have you had the food some people really really good you know and as far as bad taste gees look at the french [laughter] we've got

189.65 192.01 B: yeah i watch that that's pretty funny 

190.93 194.95 A: yeah yeah i think english humor's very different from american humor 

194.30 197.20 B: it's like it's like there's a lot of class consciousness 

197.25 203.20 B: but there's a lot of class consciousness in america humour people just don't want to um recognize it you know 

197.63 198.48 A: yeah 

202.80 207.65 A: right exactly i think that especially with english humour um 

207.96 221.48 A: english humour is is more intellectual i find you have to think about it a lot more you know um where as america humour tends be a lot more flat stick a lot more sort of in your face you know english humour can be very subtle 

211.33 212.19 B: mhm 

218.40 219.41 B: mhm 

221.37 225.13 B: yeah it's more subtle and i think it's a little more 

222.01 223.02 A: you know 

225.83 226.84 A: right 

226.32 229.15 B: like you know um that bean bean guy 

228.92 231.25 A: yeah like um mr bean 

230.61 238.15 B: mr bean it's kind of like the um the audit the of life or whatever well we have mr magoo which is similar 

231.62 232.46 A: yeah 

238.45 239.31 B: (( you know )) 

239.01 244.00 A: and i think all of that kind of humour is totally acceptable and i think that um 

244.35 255.00 A: i think we're all guilty of of of cracking a a derogatory joke about someone without being in their presence do you know what i mean like 

250.43 251.33 B: mhm 

253.68 254.60 B: mhm 

254.80 268.68 A: being with friends in the car and you see a big fat person you know and you crack a joke about them or you know whatever the case maybe i think we are all guilty of doing that um but it's one thing to to do it in the presence of other people as opposed to doing it in 

263.28 263.96 B: mhm 

268.93 271.42 A: (( their in the face of that person do you know what i )) 

270.80 278.47 B: if i feel mad at somebody i'll make like a like a sarcastic joke to kind of like express my anger but not in a mean way 

275.10 276.07 A: (( mean )) 

278.94 281.04 B: to kind of get my point across 

280.52 282.54 A: right exactly 

282.18 288.14 B: i mean i think humour is is so useful i mean it's like a weapon it makes people laugh and i mean 

288.35 295.39 A: oh it's incredibly useful and so many people who just don't have it who don't get certain parts of humour you know 

289.90 290.81 B: (( yeah )) 

294.38 295.26 B: mhm 

295.37 296.21 B: mhm 

295.49 301.29 A: but i think that as far as what's considered okay and what's considered not okay 

301.99 303.92 A: completely depends upon 

304.50 306.02 A: your audience 

305.62 307.02 B: mhm 

306.52 314.59 A: you know i mean we know there's a lot of comics out there who are very risky who broach kind of subjects that other people wouldn't broach 

314.59 325.48 A: some of them do it very well and they're very very funny about it and you're like you know yeah that was good and other people do it and you're like you kind of stepping on toes there you know that's just a little too much you know 

325.23 326.28 B: mhm 

325.87 337.24 A: um jokes about like gays i mean cause there's always funny jokes about gays about jews polish whatever do you know what i mean and then there's the jokes where 

337.68 343.15 A: they're really derogatory that you know come from almost like hate groups do you know what i mean 

342.69 343.56 B: (( yes )) 

343.99 347.76 A: and i'm like i don't find those funny 

347.80 353.08 A: you know i i i can see the humour in it but i don't find it funny if you tell me that joke 

351.98 361.08 B: i have lots of jewish i've had lots of jewish friends so to me jewish jokes are always funny because they're usually about like stinginess or something like that 

360.94 361.88 A: right 

360.99 374.62 B: but i usually tell them with jewish friends but like racial jokes where it's like against i don't know like let's say against like a minority group like let's say against mexican people if it was really nasty you know 

371.80 372.84 A: right 

374.74 377.80 B: it would be like i would bow kind of offended i guess 

377.47 388.05 A: right there's a lot of jokes going around that are sort anti-french jokes because of the war that's just happened and you know i've i come across a lot of these jokes people like e-mail them to me and stuff and i'm like uh not funny 

387.60 392.98 B: see my view is my view is i i don't it doesn't really bother me cause i think it america there's too much 

393.31 406.39 B: like the germans didn't support us either so what should we should be like not eat like german pancakes or german sausage it's just like the french are easy i've i've never i like the french culture i've never 

393.93 394.85 A: right 

396.36 398.90 A: right exactly 

406.28 416.65 B: it's like they have a right to their view point you know i think it was kind of stupid of us to you know boycott them or whatever but but it was fun cause i would like order patriot fries 

408.75 409.74 A: mhm 

416.88 419.75 B: you know instead of french fries but 

418.80 420.63 A: oh yes that's so ridiculous 

420.43 426.22 B: now it's like people go oh don't say that someone actually said if you say that to me i'm not going to give you any 

426.36 431.99 B: you know if you say patriot fries just so everybody is saying french fries again so it's like 

427.21 428.17 A: yeah 

431.12 439.88 A: i mean i i went to a job interview where the guy was like oh i'm totally boycotting everything that's french and i hate the french and you're so lucky that you are english because you are really popular right now 

439.06 441.15 B: from germany they were from germany 

440.85 442.43 A: no he was american 

441.96 442.75 B: uh-huh 

442.45 448.69 A: but i felt like saying to him oh well as a matter of fact half of my family is french bye [laughter] 

446.74 450.57 B: i mean that is so stupid you know i mean it's just like my view is 

450.76 455.91 B: i think political humour is always okay because there's no much political correction 

455.80 468.30 B: and people aren't very knowledgeable it's always good to make fun of politicians and stuff like that and the whole thing with the french i mean i really couldn't care less i mean i never boycotted them i thought that was stupid 

464.84 465.96 A: exactly 

468.18 472.09 B: i think in america it's like they like to have like a black and white approach 

472.27 473.12 A: right 

472.32 475.99 B: it's like if they don't support us and the whole way bush handled it i mean 

476.03 481.25 B: he's just a total dim gog and i mean he's just like he's just crazy 

480.01 481.39 A: (( yeah very )) 

481.59 487.99 B: because in europe you don't have to you know you have the what's that thing called the um european n- um 

488.18 500.58 B: what yeah it's like you guys have to cross right words where as bush i don't think all americas all like that but bush is like we're number one if you're not with us you're against us now that's just stupid 

488.23 490.42 A: (( dangerous )) 

497.79 499.26 A: (( exactly )) 

499.93 508.35 A: it's completely stupid because at the end of the day you know he's trying to preach democracy and a democracy and choosing your own making your own decisions you know what i mean 

507.82 508.88 B: mhm 

509.00 509.98 B: oh um 

509.25 510.10 A: i mean 

510.12 511.68 B: do you read l._a. weekly 

511.84 514.14 A: not really not at all 

512.91 522.32 B: well if you should uh pick it up because they have these this cartoon it's like a paper doll of bush it's like have your own president of the united states 

519.21 520.33 A: mhm 

522.36 535.45 B: and they're really sticking it to him you know like they have this little paratrooper outfit for him and and a little like american flag out fit i i love it when people like dissent in america because it's not really encouraged 

522.54 523.51 A: oh 

527.57 528.69 A: (( god )) 

535.35 539.53 A: right exactly it's it's really frowned upon you know and i think 

538.55 540.40 B: (( mhm )) 

539.74 552.11 A: when it comes down to humour there's humour in everything i mean there's humour in just walking down the street you know when you look at people and they've got funny walks and stuff you know you can't help but but laugh you know and um 

552.52 562.39 A: i think it's bad to laugh at someone who is you know like mentally disabled i would never laugh at somebody uh who is mentally disabled but then again i you know but then again i know 

558.96 560.58 B: yeah that's mean 

562.82 567.05 A: jokes about you know people who are mentally disabled which are quite funny 

566.30 572.69 B: i know like a joke i know i know dead baby jokes but i wouldn't want to sit around listening to them all day 

571.61 582.31 A: exactly i mean exactly you don't listen to them all day you don't tell them in the wrong company you know you know the people that you're telling those jokes to you would never necessarily do them in stand up or something you know 

572.81 573.75 B: (( you know )) 

581.71 582.95 B: mhm 

582.24 595.57 A: so i i think at the end of the day what's considered acceptable and what's not considered acceptable should be up to the audience do you know what i mean i i think that censorship which is basically what that is do you know 

595.25 596.27 B: mhm 

595.62 599.95 A: what i mean is wrong i think you should be able to speak what ever it is that you want to say and
