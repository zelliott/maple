371.19 372.81 B: oh yeah that's true 

373.94 380.19 A: i mean did he start the thing about um if you're a redneck [laughter] 

379.21 380.87 B: yeah i think he did

393.40 395.84 A: uh oh sure they have 

395.86 397.97 A: everything goes to the extreme 

398.43 400.95 A: especially television takes it there 

400.98 407.42 A: i imagine night clubs do i just haven't i don't go to night clubs so i don't know [laughter] 

405.89 414.70 B: yeah have you ever been to a comedy a live comedy show like you know at a at a comedy show or you know comedy 

414.05 418.17 A: i've been to a theater once that was a comedy you know like a 

418.63 427.80 A: [mn] but that's about as close as i got i never have gotten really to a night club act you know where they take turns being comedians or anything 

427.79 431.60 B: mhm we we've been a couple of times when my wife and i were dating 

432.05 442.09 B: uh we went to a couple of comedy clubs like that and and then they were pretty good because you know i mean they had some limits to 'em i mean they you know 

442.07 450.63 B: they kinda got out there at times but you know there wasn't nothing like what they got on you know h._b._o. and stuff nowadays so 

449.84 452.10 A: right tastefully done 

451.97 453.94 B: right but uh 

454.05 456.81 B: those are you know those are pretty funny uh 

456.41 464.91 A: i'd be afraid to go now i'd i'd think they'd pick you out of the audience and pick on you you know like you see 'em do that [laughter] 

463.25 473.44 B: yeah no i i have seen 'em do that we went to a we went to a comedy club thing one night when they were doing a a hypnosis deal 

473.97 475.22 A: (( oh my )) 

474.10 480.07 B: and they brought like i don't know half a dozen people or so out of the audience 

480.14 482.04 A: and really hypnotized them 

481.85 488.33 B: supposedly yeah now we we never did figure out or i never did figure out whether it was you know 

487.79 489.83 A: whether they were in the act or not 

489.44 503.00 B: right i mean i always thought that they were just you know people sitting out there that was part of this you know group and you know he's just like supposedly randomly picking 'em out but you know he knows [laughter] exactly where they're sitting you know 

489.96 491.17 A: yeah 

502.53 504.13 A: right 

503.23 506.56 B: you know i don't know it's hard to say you know but uh 

505.06 506.19 A: uh 

506.72 510.28 B: i wouldn't want to do it i could never do anything like that you know 

511.07 515.58 A: right the embarrassment would never exceed [laughter] 

513.51 522.35 B: oh yeah absolutely yeah but you know what they say that that military people are some of the easiest people to hypnotize 

522.33 524.36 A: and do you know why that is 

524.52 527.54 B: because of the discipline supposedly 

526.83 530.84 A: because they teach you to follow orders and that's what it's all about 

530.64 531.89 B: yeah 

532.31 533.21 A: yeah 

532.86 533.74 B: so 

533.79 537.80 B: but it was funny watching the people up there you know 

536.83 543.62 A: did they do the cu- cr- uh [laughter] uh crow like a rooster and all that kind of thing [laughter] 

541.12 547.27 B: oh yeah just you know all sorts of stuff they were making 'em do you know bark like a dog and 

545.31 555.80 A: oh dear that would just end it wouldn't it [laughter] go home at night and say what did i do oh no you sat there and let me do that [laughter] 

548.08 549.54 B: (( yeah )) 

555.23 562.66 B: yeah you got up on stage you barked like a dog crowed like a rooster you know you just uh [laughter] 

557.66 559.27 A: oh right 

560.50 568.52 A: and that would be one of the unfunny things in my book [laughter] they want to know where i'd draw the line and yeah [laughter] 

567.23 570.79 B: yeah i i think i would have to draw the line there too 

569.99 578.62 A: when they're using us for the joke that's where i wanna draw the line [laughter] oh and uh 

573.71 575.62 B: absolutely 

579.24 587.09 A: of course like you said that f word thing some of them can't tell a joke without using that they can't even talk a sentence without using that 

581.64 582.53 B: yeah 

586.69 589.71 B: (( yeah you know and and what's up with that i mean what )) 

589.49 591.07 A: i don't know 

590.51 595.29 B: you know normal people don't use that in their conversation you know i mean why do 

595.89 597.29 A: mhm 

596.83 599.62 B: so i i don't understand 

597.41 598.80 A: right
