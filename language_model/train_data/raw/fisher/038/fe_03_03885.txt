5.07 10.25 B: hi okay so um we're growing to talk about 

10.38 15.22 A: comedy and between the difference between bad taste and 

15.36 16.92 A: but something funny 

16.62 17.50 B: uh-huh 

17.49 21.22 A: and how you decide the difference and what you do 

21.85 24.36 A: tell me exactly what did you hear from the question 

24.39 30.13 B: yeah something like that you know what is um bad comedy and which one is like not 

30.20 31.51 B: not nice 

31.03 31.92 A: right 

33.85 37.48 A: and how what's your feeling about that 

36.25 47.89 B: um well i think comedy would be like clean fun you know funny stuff like that and i think when it becomes insulting to us some people or maybe 

48.01 50.96 B: you know then that becomes um bad comedy 

51.72 52.75 A: right 

52.96 53.85 A: um 

54.13 62.49 A: do you feel it's okay to you can somewhat poke fun at people but yet when it goes beyond the line of being insulting or 

62.55 66.66 A: in bad taste um i'll say even sexual or 

66.76 67.65 B: yeah 

67.02 70.20 A: even harassment that's not good comedy 

69.87 70.91 B: yeah 

70.36 71.62 A: i agree too 

71.77 79.63 A: um i'm not the type of person that i i'm usually can take fun you know if poke people poke fun and i have a good sense of humour 

80.16 93.12 A: and when i watch comedy shows um some things are very funny but there's times when i completely turn the channel off or i will not listening to the comedian if uh especially very vulgar language 

84.24 85.11 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

92.80 93.77 B: mhm 

93.22 95.03 A: it just turns me off 

94.60 95.64 B: yeah 

95.11 103.18 A: there's a lot of funny things to talk about and funny situations and and there's a lot of funny people but some i feel are just uh 

102.80 104.16 B: too vulgar 

103.72 106.08 A: exactly i agree 

106.13 118.28 A: and i've even come across people that um you just meet maybe at a party or maybe just in a social event where they think the joke is hysterical but it's very bad taste 

115.88 116.65 B: mhm 

117.77 128.48 B: yeah well sometimes some of them are um they just don't know what they're talking about or they don't know that it's you know hurting somebody or hitting somebody in the wrong spot 

127.87 129.05 A: exactly 

129.20 130.47 A: they're out of line 

130.07 131.23 B: yeah 

130.71 134.27 A: i agree so what would you do in a situation like that 

134.58 141.28 B: well i just would just i probably would just tell them you know it's not really as fun as you think 

140.83 141.80 A: correct 

142.36 143.47 A: (( and walk about )) 

143.30 144.88 B: (( and yeah )) 

143.98 144.87 A: i know 

147.40 150.69 A: i know it's true to do you um 

151.81 153.51 A: do you watch comedy shows 

153.18 159.54 B: um yeah yeah i like um like um what is it frasier 

159.41 160.65 A: oh right 

159.99 162.08 B: yeah and friends 

162.94 166.60 A: do you ever watch the do you have a channel that has just comedy on 

166.64 170.82 A: like live comedy or comedians that stand up and have their show 

169.81 173.80 B: um i've watched it a few times not all the time 

172.09 172.86 A: uh-huh 

173.37 174.64 A: yeah 

173.85 177.82 B: i don't remember the names of the comedians though 

177.55 185.73 A: right i know i enjoy that too but there's certain ones that i'll just turn the channel off i can just tell right away that uh 

185.43 188.86 B: yeah a lot of them use really foul language 

188.14 200.22 A: oh very very much so i agree with you and it's not even needed you know some of them can be very funny but for some reason they have to add that and it doesn't do any good to uh 

197.40 198.25 B: mhm 

200.21 205.85 A: the joke doesn't make it funnier and i don't find why they feel that they need to do that 

202.32 203.21 B: well 

205.06 216.62 B: yeah well even those jerry springer shows some people watch it they think it's funny watching those people talk about all of this vulgar stuff but they're not really funny and 

210.09 211.12 A: right 

213.20 215.20 A: i agree yeah 

215.95 217.05 A: i agree 

216.56 221.61 B: and it's not a joke it's a joke on other people and i think most of them are fake 

221.56 222.38 A: right 

221.69 229.02 B: they're not real they are just try to make money out and try to be popular or whatever trying to be in the t._v. and 

224.81 225.94 A: of course 

229.41 232.33 B: that's stupid that's plain stupid i think 

229.52 230.28 A: i 

231.90 240.26 A: i i agree too and you know what too there are so many funny things that you can talk about you know just circumstances with children that you've gone through or 

236.68 237.70 B: mhm 

239.57 240.66 B: mhm 

240.05 250.44 A: or teachers or anything in life you can really you know look at it in a different way and make it funny so there is no need to um make it 

249.32 249.98 B: (( mhm )) 

250.54 252.56 A: to the point that it's not 

253.47 258.87 A: being able to listen to especially i feel as a woman some of the things they say are really degrading 

258.53 259.58 B: yeah 

259.58 263.98 A: so i i yeah i agree with you there and um 

264.31 273.82 A: one thing too is it's a shame because some people are so funny and their jokes are great and even children could listen to them but then they have to throw in 

271.51 272.28 B: yeah 

273.76 274.70 B: (( yeah )) 

274.14 278.25 A: you know something sexual or the bad language and that's a shame 

278.49 281.89 B: you know have you watched that movie it's called it's 

283.17 284.21 A: no 

283.61 286.58 B: steven martin it's it's very funny 

286.02 287.51 A: is it 

286.61 292.45 B: yes it's a good movie they're really con artist something like that but it's real funny 

288.18 289.37 A: (( oh i )) 

291.93 293.79 A: i'll have to look at that 

293.08 295.68 B: it's a it's a real old movie like 

295.35 302.24 A: that's why cause you know yeah years ago they wouldn't think of putting in things like that 

300.35 301.30 B: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

302.35 313.25 A: and so far the um standards have been lowered especially by hollywood and that and it's a shame because uh when i think of my parents watching 

306.75 307.57 B: mhm 

308.52 309.33 B: mhm 

313.35 316.74 A: show and many other programs you know 

313.85 314.68 B: mhm 

316.89 328.73 A: that they came on and they were clean and the whole family could watch them and you still laughed and it was hysterical yet um now i see how things have changed and it's really sad 

321.14 322.02 B: yeah 

327.27 328.22 B: yeah 

328.90 329.95 B: (( yeah )) 

328.97 330.34 A: i don't like it 

330.43 333.75 B: you should also watch the father of the bride that's also

341.34 342.29 B: no 

341.93 352.42 A: oh we enjoy that too it's funny sometimes it's not appropriate for children but um he's really funny cause he really talks and makes you laugh about family life 

351.90 353.37 B: mhm 

353.40 365.66 A: but it is a shame um i know we live in san francisco we love uh to go we used to love not so much now but when we were first married my husband and i we'd go see comedy shows a lot the hotels and that had them
