0.40 1.42 A: hello 

0.87 2.04 B: hello 

1.71 2.61 A: hi 

2.25 3.28 B: (( how are you )) 

2.95 4.04 A: (( good how are you )) 

3.74 9.07 B: good um [lipsmack] i kind of got the question but it's it's just distinguishing good humor from bad humor 

8.94 9.95 A: yeah 

9.59 20.87 B: yeah um do you want me to get my op- my opinion on it because this is the first time i'm doing this right um good humor i kind of think that it's when everybody can laugh and you're not offending anybody in particular 

13.73 14.71 A: yeah 

20.65 21.32 A: uh-huh 

21.01 34.68 B: and i also think that bad humor um is when you know you're making you could be making fun of a group of individuals standing there or a particular person and that goes beyond humor it's like kind of like being insulting 

34.70 48.19 B: and you're trying to get everybody to laugh at it um that's kind of my disting- distinction between good humor good humor's where you're not really offending anybody in particular it's kind of more of a generalized sense of humor 

46.55 47.42 A: yeah 

48.25 53.89 B: as opposed to like bad humor or also bad humor can be um distinguished by 

53.89 67.95 B: not being very funny i mean you could also look at it that way too where you think that it's um [lipsmack] getting or where no one laughs about it and you know no one chuckles about it so you can distinguish it in kind of two ways 

68.08 69.06 A: yeah 

68.12 70.02 B: as as far as um 

70.20 78.20 B: [mn] as far as being bad humor um i think it's very good to have um humor each day i think um laughing is you know 

78.23 81.97 B: very good for the soul and um very good health wise 

81.90 93.46 B: um i love humor and i think that um [mn] pretty much everybody should just um be good humored but sometimes we can't distinguish good humor between bad humor because sometimes we say something 

93.80 98.18 B: assuming that we're not offending somebody and maybe we are 

98.28 111.69 B: um you know we could be saying something about a race or or a sex or something like that and thinking that it's funny to us and it may not be funny to an individual so um 

111.13 120.12 A: uh-huh part of the question was that um what what do you do like how do you deal with that like when it does cross the line how do you deal with that 

120.04 127.08 B: um well it depends on if it's affecting yourself or your your friend that's with you 

127.03 137.06 B: or your children that are with you or your maybe a spouse um how you draw the line a number of things um number one would be to um 

137.42 147.39 B: stop it or if it's been said um see you can change the subject um you can kind of um look to see if the person that 

147.65 153.20 B: if a person was offended that p- like you know your spouse or [mn] your child or whatever 

153.23 155.81 B: um you could kind of just um 

156.29 162.57 B: draw the line you can maybe not let it happen again um let that person or let that person know 

162.60 171.85 B: afterwards that they've offended a particular person um you could do that also um drawing the line you could just um 

171.86 175.54 B: depends on how much you offended the person or or um 

175.80 190.13 B: ah let me see or and and if it was too and and also making sure that the person knows that they said something that wasn't humorous that was in bad taste um letting the person know it depends on how much you know the person 

189.81 190.86 A: yeah 

191.21 192.65 B: am i supposed to continue 

193.01 194.47 B: or are you asking me more

197.35 198.27 B: okay 

198.32 199.28 B: um 

198.94 203.46 A: it's not like really there's not like a lot of pressure or anything it's just a casual conversation 

203.05 203.98 B: okay 

204.66 207.17 B: any um more questions for me or do you want me to continue 

207.78 208.73 A: um

237.08 237.88 B: oh 

237.69 239.47 A: it's just like they 

239.84 242.71 A: they're just doing studies of like um 

243.28 246.75 A: just strangers talking about a particular topic 

246.32 252.42 B: mhm now you're supposed to let me know what your opinion is of it okay i'll let you talk [laughter] 

249.74 250.91 A: yeah 

252.78 257.25 A: um well i mean i agree with everything that you said that's why i didn't really that's you know 

257.49 258.29 A: um 

259.26 260.73 A: i mean usually 

261.34 265.17 A: i mean i love humor too and sometimes i think 

265.36 270.24 A: people try to be too sometimes even like especially nowadays because 

268.02 268.93 B: mhm 

270.48 271.78 A: there's so many 

271.85 274.45 A: different ways that you can offen- offend people 

274.51 275.37 B: mhm 

274.68 276.47 A: and stuff and um 

277.62 285.18 B: i guess high high schoolers are a lot of high schools that i know um and college or especially high school i think that sometimes 

277.68 278.65 A: and so 

279.56 280.41 A: (( yeah mm )) 

285.15 293.36 B: they want to see their friends um get their friends to laugh 'cause i used to be in elementary school you know get one of their friends to laugh at something 

293.33 300.40 B: and sometimes they do off- you know it could be offending another student or a friend you know another friend um 

300.48 303.38 B: and they don't realize how far they've they've gone 

303.00 304.24 A: yeah 

303.69 304.95 B: you know [lipsmack] 

304.36 309.77 A: well a lot of it has to do with like just the natural like mob mentality of people like if you 

309.82 312.01 A: you know how they say like um 

312.22 320.46 A: if you say something funny and you get i mean if i mean if you do something that you're trying to be funny and get some response to it and you have other people that 

321.24 328.78 A: you know harp in on it and laugh on at it and then you'll you'll just like try and keep doing it because you think that everyone thinks it's funny 

328.92 330.08 B: oh okay 

329.37 331.22 A: you know but then other times 

331.54 337.56 A: in the same situation if if someone stops it right away and says that it's not 

337.73 342.46 A: you know right to be doing that then um then no one will 

343.48 347.42 A: it's like everyone will jump in and think yeah it's not funny you know 

347.19 348.25 B: (( mhm )) 

347.45 353.07 A: it kind of goes that way i've noticed that a lot like in other words like whatever the group thinks is funny 

353.18 363.98 A: or thinks is appropriate then people will just kind of go along with that because they're kind of afraid to speak otherwise and be and be and be seen as like an outsider of the group 

353.37 354.01 B: (( mhm )) 

359.24 360.04 B: yes 

363.38 364.32 B: mhm 

364.80 378.78 B: and it's also sometimes kids think it's cool to to um [lipsmack] be funny and and to sometimes like i said before to um [lipsmack] say something about a particular i'm i'm just referring it to schools all of a sudden but i kind of think that 

367.13 368.12 A: yeah 

368.21 369.30 A: exactly 

378.92 389.60 B: like especially with guys they sometimes fell rank on somebody or girls or or whatever just that their buddies can laugh at it i think that i don't know if guys do it more but um 

389.99 393.36 B: i just kind of think that you know how you draw the line is 

393.31 400.04 B: you know you just kind of like you don't you know stop it in the butt right away 'cause it can continue it can get really ugly 

399.63 400.59 A: yeah 

400.00 412.52 B: you know what i mean [lipsmack] it can get like later on in life it can i mean [lipsmack] if they know that they're getting away with it or they're getting a rise out of everybody or a good laugh they might think that it's um the right thing to do 

400.69 401.59 A: yeah 

412.48 421.18 A: yeah well and plus i really believe that people who make jokes at the expense of others definitely there's there's some like security issues with themselves 

412.68 413.65 B: you know 

420.70 422.05 B: oh yeah 

421.34 424.09 A: where they have to like where they feel like 

424.40 425.69 A: you know they'll only 

424.89 426.40 B: to prove themselves 

425.99 428.39 A: right like you know make other people 

428.49 440.90 A: embarrassed or um seem lower because so that they can make themselves appear higher you know in some way or another either by excluding them making them feel like they should be made fun of because they're in a certain group that they're not in you know 

435.24 435.83 B: (( mhm )) 

440.45 441.28 B: yeah 

441.29 443.65 B: yeah well yeah 

441.53 446.03 A: so i mean a lot of that has to do with like personal things i think yeah 

445.09 447.79 B: yeah like in like you said insecurity or um 

448.11 449.88 B: [lipsmack] how secure 

449.89 464.20 B: a person is and stuff like that you know but um you know unfortunately sometimes it goes unnoticed that the person that they're aiming it at or people that they're aiming at might not say anything or might you know and take or or you know you might be doing a very um 

451.51 452.41 A: yeah 

464.29 465.39 B: (( [mn] um )) 

465.54 471.09 B: not directly at the person but like it depends on the person receiving it they could be also insecure 

471.20 472.05 B: too 

471.78 472.66 A: yeah 

472.04 484.95 B: you know and and take it and and but not say anything about it or you know not getting um [lipsmack] you know or not say anything about it where i think that they should address it right away you know address the issue right out 

484.82 493.55 B: you know get um but no good humor is just i guess it's just a joke that it's like a general kind of thing as opposed to hidden 

493.61 498.82 B: targets you know of people and stuff like that have you ever been offended um [lipsmack] 

498.44 499.91 A: oh yeah of course 

499.53 501.20 B: yeah you do 

499.97 503.22 A: [laughter] i mean i think any you too 

503.15 511.74 B: yeah you do in different forms of your life it's funny 'cause sometimes for a lot of times the people are not aware of it right or have you or are you or 

510.98 516.76 A: oh no it's been it's been direct i mean especially in high school because i mean if you're not like if you don't fit into 

517.05 518.00 B: clique [lipsmack] 

517.15 520.58 A: so the the very typical weight 

520.66 522.07 A: um you know 

522.37 523.39 A: um 

523.42 534.84 A: beaver family look household then you're of course going and and it goes along with that same thing i was saying about not belonging to the most common group and um you know people 

525.16 526.08 B: oh 

526.09 527.04 B: yeah 

532.21 533.08 B: yeah 

535.37 538.73 A: feeling that that's something that should be made fun of or something 

538.36 545.47 B: [mn] now do you um [lipsmack] do you think it happens more with girls or more with guys or does it kind of not 

545.60 546.92 B: make a difference 

546.49 550.38 A: yeah i don't think it makes a difference 'cause i mean i know that guys 

550.91 554.94 A: like to do it because they're just brutal sometimes and you know they they feel like 

555.30 556.85 A: picking on other 

556.83 570.39 A: less fortunate guys or girls is like cool or manly or studly or whatever you know especially in high school and then girls too you know how much they cost if they get all catty and stuff so [laughter] but yeah that's a good question male or female i think it's i think it's about the same 

560.81 561.68 B: yeah 

564.43 567.14 B: sure [laughter] i know 

569.77 581.64 B: yeah 'cause um i think on both sides of the coin you like you said they can be um [mn] you know depends on the day the mood the person you know if you have someone that's kinda gawky or someone that's not um 

581.80 592.44 B: [lipsmack] that they you know that they always pick oh like a bookworm or something like that they're gonna they're gonna be more of a more of a target you know what i'm saying it can really and it can go very far 'cause if it doesn't get 

584.64 585.60 A: yeah 

592.34 599.89 B: stopped right away i mean you know sometimes these kids react not necessarily kids but people react um [mn]
