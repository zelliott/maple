0.14 2.15 A: hi i'm becky 

1.61 3.37 B: hi this is sharon 

4.23 5.53 A: how are you today 

5.28 7.26 B: oh good are we connected 

6.65 8.18 A: (( i guess so [laughter] )) 

7.31 14.58 B: okay [laughter] okay so our question is how do we draw the line between acceptable humor and humor that's not good 

14.13 17.75 A: right i think it depends on like um 

15.00 16.10 B: (( okay mhm )) 

18.06 23.21 A: the group at hand and what your beliefs and morals and 

23.91 27.03 A: [sigh] i guess how you live your everyday life i mean 

27.00 27.93 B: right 

27.53 33.44 A: there's distasteful stuff out that that's just i wouldn't want my children to hear most definitely 

31.00 31.67 B: (( yeah )) 

33.44 40.62 B: yeah i i agree i agree um where you stand in just your everyday life is going to determine on what you 

40.80 47.07 B: find funny or not i know some of the things i thought was funny when i was ten 

42.28 43.18 A: right 

46.76 47.68 A: (( [laughter] )) 

47.10 52.91 B: [laughter] i didn't think was funny at fifteen and the stuff i thought was funny at fifteen i didn't think was funny at twenty 

53.23 54.35 B: um 

54.64 58.00 B: so and of course and there's some i guess that's also 

58.04 64.02 B: an age thing as well because some of the stuff at ten wasn't you know appropriate it just was kind of 

62.30 62.86 A: (( mm )) 

63.74 66.63 A: gross [laughter] 

64.53 69.00 B: yeah yeah [laughter] is a little silly a little silly thing 

66.80 72.08 A: yeah i i remember like um i have children uh that are five and under 

72.07 73.17 B: mm me too 

72.31 76.01 A: and they think bellowing noises are just hilarious 

75.57 77.39 B: (( oh yeah yeah )) 

76.41 82.84 A: and uh of course dad encourages this behavior but i wouldn't want them to that in public [laughter] 

79.54 80.66 B: yeah 

81.72 84.44 B: right yeah exactly 

84.53 92.44 B: um 'cause i guess then when we're in the adult level outside of that little child which is kinda humorous stuff and the adult level say 

92.52 102.52 B: even uh because i'm thirty seven when i was and i'm a christian also so when i was in my gosh i got saved when i was about twenty five i guess 

97.23 98.17 A: right 

102.36 115.19 B: those things that i thought funny at twenty five you know not just those childish things but you know some of those really kind of off color things it was just like wow it became shocking to me as i got you know older and more mature in my faith 

114.81 120.00 A: [noise] right [noise] 'cause some of things y- aren't acceptable to talk about once you're 

120.74 122.12 A: older [noise] 

121.76 123.66 B: yeah yeah 

122.49 123.79 A: i'm thirty two 

123.89 127.23 A: so yeah i understand completely um [noise] [noise] 

124.06 125.18 B: (( oh okay )) 

126.28 127.26 B: yeah 

127.64 140.66 B: i remember back in the day i used to watch saturday night live and i used to think it oh this is so funny and all that you know off color and making fun of political figures and all that it was like aha ha ha but now it's like 

140.48 146.63 B: no [laughter] yeah exactly exactly 

141.71 145.15 A: which changed the [laughter] yeah 

145.47 147.58 A: i understand yes 

147.56 158.52 B: yeah and even when i think about you know humor that pokes fun at people and even though that may not be considered off color it's still you know gosh i don't want anybody to feel like 

158.61 165.13 B: they're the butt of somebody's joke because of how they look or dress or whatever 

161.39 162.79 A: right 

163.24 164.17 A: right 

165.37 168.13 A: right and that becomes um 

169.97 173.26 A: i guess it it becomes an issue at the workplace too 

173.41 177.56 B: mm mm yeah good point that's true that's true 

176.72 184.09 A: 'cause especially now with sexual harrassment laws and stuff like that i mean if somebody is offended by you said then 

183.04 184.17 B: mhm 

184.28 188.96 A: you know it doesn't matter how tasteful or tasteless the joke was 

189.14 190.93 A: it it becomes an issue 

190.91 192.67 B: right right 

192.98 202.38 B: and i guess like you say it all goes back to where the person's values are how they live their life what their principles are as to what they're gonna find humorous mhm 

202.24 203.26 A: right 

203.97 205.04 A: are you still there 

204.84 205.72 B: uh-huh 

205.32 209.28 A: okay 'cause it clicked and i'm like i don't have call waiting [laughter] 

208.62 212.35 B: okay oh is that so that wasn't our ten minutes thing that's just a okay 

211.07 212.41 A: no i don't think so 

212.55 213.51 B: okay 

212.59 221.19 A: i'll think she'll come back and tell us when ten minutes is or something i've been to two comedy clubs in my life one of them um was the comedy barn in 

221.32 224.02 A: uh pigeon fords tennessee 

223.86 224.83 B: mhm 

224.40 226.06 A: and it was hilarious 

226.22 235.37 A: primarily because it was good clean fun you know they they didn't make fun of anyone they didn't cuss they didn't um 

235.70 239.80 A: you know embarrass anyone it was just it was like um 

237.80 239.23 B: (( mhm mhm right )) 

240.99 243.11 A: the old vaudeville acts 

242.70 244.96 B: mhm who's on first 

243.23 245.88 A: you know like red skelton and that sort of thing 

245.56 247.91 B: yeah the who's on first kind of thing 

245.97 251.08 A: but the first one i went to yeah the first one it was funny but of course i was twenty one 

251.14 252.15 B: yeah 

251.49 256.78 A: and it was cussing and poking fun and i 

255.76 256.98 B: mhm 

257.06 258.39 B: mhm 

257.35 261.68 A: don't know yes drunks are funny but [laughter] there's a line somewhere 

259.78 260.76 B: yeah 

261.34 262.98 B: right right 

262.95 266.45 B: don't you get kinda tired too of the the direction that 

266.35 278.93 B: uh television humor has gone 'cause you know back in the day of course they tried to play it safe but now it's like let's push the envelope as much as we can you know [laughter] on prime time or whenever let's you know 

268.59 269.74 A: oh yeah 

275.24 276.38 A: right 

278.80 281.62 B: even sometimes cartoons are like that 

281.45 283.07 A: i know um 

281.90 284.90 B: p- particularly with the poking fun stuff 

284.47 285.51 A: yeah 

285.38 286.60 B: mhm 

286.38 287.17 A: um 

287.94 291.35 A: we have some old recordings of 

291.59 297.96 A: bugs bunny and coyote and road runner and and now i watch those and i'm like you know this is really funny any more 

297.69 298.72 B: yeah 

298.09 308.84 A: you know when the poor coyote gets smashed every time the road runner gets the best of him i'm like is this really funny is this stuff for my children to watch [laughter] 

301.38 302.50 B: right 

302.63 303.46 B: yeah 

307.78 311.05 B: right right i have that same problem 

310.99 325.54 B: you know it's it's just very difficult to find things that are amusing i know we watch veggietale sometimes and um and i appreciate you know the things they do and sometimes their humor may be a little bit above the kids' head but it's still appropriate humor it's not 

322.39 323.54 A: yeah 

325.41 329.16 B: you know some of this crazy stuff that's on television 

328.97 329.89 A: right 

329.48 335.03 B: but it still can be kind of mature you know little subtle things that the kids wouldn't pick up 

335.01 340.69 A: we watched the power puff girls the other day i've never seen it before until two days ago 

340.83 344.31 A: and that is such a violent cartoon 

344.49 346.83 A: [laughter] and they poke fun at 

344.62 345.60 B: yeah 

347.08 350.92 A: things that i don't think that my five year old is gonna understand 

350.15 351.22 B: right 

351.28 352.29 B: right 

352.51 353.39 A: i think 

353.46 359.36 A: i think our comedy maturity level like you said has just gone way past what it should be 

359.40 360.56 B: yeah 

360.69 361.89 A: but of course 

362.13 365.52 A: i guess we're considered old fogies now [laughter] 

364.41 367.50 B: yes yeah that's true that's true 

367.59 373.85 B: but i wish there was and i can't even think of any right off hand any comedians that i could say just are 

373.88 380.17 B: have such clean humor you know they do just it's a joy because everybody wants to laugh and likes to laugh 

380.19 384.97 B: but who can you recommend to anybody to say hey you know watch this show or go to this 

385.00 395.05 B: comedy routine and you know you'll be pleasantly surprised that there's nothing offensive i mean there's just at least right now no one i can think of like that 

395.24 396.70 B: do you know of anyone 

397.51 406.63 A: not right off hand but i can i can tell you my husband brought home um this has been a couple of months ago he brought home robin williams the h._b._o. special 

406.35 407.25 B: (( mhm mm )) 

407.54 409.22 A: i was appalled 

410.45 411.39 B: yeah 

410.98 419.48 A: a- i think he's wonderful in movies and that sort of thing he you know he's funny but the language on that h._b._o. special oh my goodness 

414.60 417.39 B: mhm mhm 

419.77 429.21 B: yeah isn't that amazing 'cause you do you see these characters i know sinbad is another one you'll see him in movies and he's so child oriented sometimes in the movie 

429.21 434.91 B: and then you'll hear him and he's um i don't think he's ever anyone who really cusses so much but 

435.07 439.95 B: just the innuendos and things are just like whoa wait [laughter] 

438.94 440.22 A: (( right )) 

440.61 448.97 B: yeah i think probably a lot of those ones that we see in the movies like that then when you really get 'em on their home turf with the comedy 

449.01 453.17 B: and they're like wow so this is what you really find humorous huh 

452.27 456.69 A: i know like george carlin i i'm sure you're familiar with him 

456.34 457.78 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

456.74 460.99 A: um he narrates the thomas the tank engine video 

461.07 462.69 B: [lipsmack] does he really 

461.98 463.11 A: yes 

463.02 464.34 B: (( wow mhm )) 

463.22 476.54 A: and when i first heard the thomas the tank engine video i was like who is that and then of course it showed the credits at the end and it as george carlin and i was i was amazed because you know you always hear about him in such a 

477.16 481.64 A: bad way i guess not not bad necessarily but you know off color 

478.32 480.21 B: right right 

481.35 483.38 B: yes mhm 

482.49 486.51 A: form and here he is narrating for children's videos 

486.41 487.02 B: (( mm )) 

488.48 492.25 A: i'm not sure if that's a real good message to send to our children [laughter] 

491.34 493.58 B: i i know and the 

492.39 497.60 A: hey i can be this way at night but you can be this way during the day you know how hypocritical is that right 

495.54 509.00 B: yeah it well even to think that the producers or whoever did it would be like hey let's go get george carlin [laughter] it's like i just like what [laughter] why as many people out here as can do it [laughter] 

501.36 503.05 A: (( [laughter] )) 

507.77 510.10 A: exactly [laughter] 

508.99 510.56 B: oh man 

510.45 512.66 A: get big bird [laughter] 

511.71 512.42 B: (( yea- )) 

512.50 521.46 B: right oh wouldn't we be surprised if he does stand up somewhere [laughter] oh it's yes [laughter] [lipsmack] 

516.01 518.64 A: oh no [laughter] that'd be awful 

519.16 522.73 A: i guess bob hope is one of the fellows that 

523.02 524.16 B: ah 

523.29 527.41 A: he's pretty he's been clean all these years 

524.47 525.76 B: (( yeah )) 

526.36 529.82 B: yeah that's a good one good one mhm 

529.19 533.75 A: 'cause he does the i mean but he's more along the lines of red skelton 

533.53 537.35 B: yeah yeah real old school real old school mhm 

535.50 536.58 A: yeah 

537.02 538.28 A: i guess the 

538.50 542.42 A: the newer comedy is just off color 

542.46 543.62 B: yeah 

543.68 553.89 B: well it's a very interesting topic and i'm gonna have to tell my husband 'cause he's another one he loves humor even more than myself and it's so hard you know to find anything that's not off color 

547.52 548.11 A: (( [laughter] )) 

553.37 554.56 A: yeah 

554.33 557.36 B: so i've this makes me think that i wanna 

557.71 569.20 B: be even more attentive to that to see if there are any comedians out there you do have family friendly type of of humor 'cause i pretty much as far as sitcoms go i've pretty much given up on 

569.59 581.91 B: there being anything that the whole household 'cause i have like i said children under five as well that the whole household can sit down and watch um like me and my husband we like king of queens but even that um 

576.28 577.27 A: right 

582.05 584.11 A: no match for little biddy people 

582.16 583.15 B: you know 

584.03 584.96 B: yeah 

585.01 585.61 A: (( yeah )) 

585.81 587.06 B: and um 

588.11 589.09 B: they 

589.69 594.38 B: the innuendo you know the sexual innuendo and um 

594.76 599.89 A: not only that ther- there's violence involved you know they have the simpson on and king of the hill 

594.93 595.95 B: doing
