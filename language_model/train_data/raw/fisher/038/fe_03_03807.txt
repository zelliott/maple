88.50 91.19 B: i mean that's just my experience i mean what do 

90.42 101.99 A: i totally agree that is exactly the type of people that do something like that or they're just doing it to get to get a rise out of that person to see if they're willing to stand up for what they believe in

142.65 143.89 B: yeah 

143.98 149.96 A: i think i even admit to m- admit to that myself [laughter] oh my 

148.89 152.42 B: (( i heard a yeah i heard a study on um i )) 

152.59 158.68 B: wish i i could find it because i i remember the people that showed it to me i i don't know if it was a book or an article but it was 

158.79 161.64 B: it was about humor the the the um 

162.09 169.00 B: psychology of humor and jokes and it was and they it was years ago but now now i'm thinking about it again 

169.02 176.75 B: it just analyses like and it kinda broke it down into actually it was kinda like a study on jokes and and and there's 

177.25 180.25 B: oh there might there's maybe twelve categories 

180.34 194.21 B: you know of different kinds of jokes and and like what people find funny and it's not coming back to me that clearly but it was interesting it was it was pretty like accurate i'd never thought before about doing a study on something like that 

181.97 183.16 A: right 

194.10 199.67 B: but um actually analyzing what it is and you know in some some mor- morality 

199.95 201.56 B: forms than others 

201.82 203.10 B: um 

204.45 206.70 A: well it can also go you know 

205.31 210.12 B: for example people laugh at other people's misfortunes that that was in there 

211.61 213.16 B: go sorry i interrupted you 

212.69 213.85 A: no that's okay 

213.85 225.65 A: no that's true people do but it's also who who who is listening to whether it pertains to them like i know i was watching star search the other night and my son loves the comedy part 

215.67 216.87 B: that was in there 

225.54 226.36 B: (( yeah )) 

225.60 239.41 A: and it was a woman doing the comedy you know and she was doing it about her kids and cleaning the house and stuff and he didn't really get it and i loved it you know what i mean [laughter] so it's always too who who who is getting it who's not getting it 

234.36 235.19 B: yeah 

239.34 242.44 A: and who is who is it pointed toward but um 

242.74 246.95 A: but i could see that being a huge study so many different variables 

246.68 251.56 B: yeah i now i'm i'm curious now to try to talk to the people that i 

251.92 255.13 B: that told me about that because i i still talk and so 

253.28 254.55 A: mhm 

255.20 257.84 B: (( now i'm curious maybe you're you're you could be curious too )) 

258.03 262.87 B: like something on it like maybe some- something on the internet you could like research 

262.67 263.70 A: right 

263.27 266.07 B: the the uh 'cause humor and then 

266.20 275.59 B: it it was interesting how it shook out because it really wasn't it actually kind of had a whole lot there wasn't that many different things i mean it was a lot but not that many 

275.35 276.36 A: right 

276.33 278.04 B: and um 

278.33 283.26 B: like if you think of charlie chaplin and falling down and you know 

282.94 286.84 A: [laughter] right slap what do they call it slap 

283.53 284.84 B: that kind of stuff 

286.54 287.66 B: slapstick 

287.22 288.91 A: slapstick humor 

287.85 295.16 B: but that's that's that's that's really into laughing at somebody that you know is different or can't walk right you know 

294.92 296.53 A: yeah 

295.88 301.65 B: although that's kinda like more funny though that's not but i don't know you have to really think don't ya 

298.72 299.73 A: well 

301.52 302.83 A: yeah you do 

302.48 308.37 B: it's interesting because sometimes we get on the surface we get kind of drawn in well 'cause we know it's only a movie right 

307.73 310.24 A: well we know it's a movie and 

309.52 311.55 B: that's not okay necessarily 

311.09 316.23 A: right well you have the comedians too telling about how poor they were when they were young 

311.65 312.52 B: go ahead 

316.19 327.31 A: and you get you feel like you can laugh at it because th- they went through and they're laughing they're trying to make you laugh with it so you feel like you can laugh at it but some people like that's not funny 

316.58 317.37 B: (( yeah )) 

322.76 323.58 B: yeah 

327.57 331.06 A: you know [laughter] th- that's pretty awful [mn] 

328.82 334.51 B: right e- e- especially people with disabilities too that's awful like stuttering you know 

333.03 335.53 A: yeah right 

334.59 338.76 B: well wouldn't call that disability but that's that's one that's typically laughed at 

338.15 339.85 A: yeah it is 

338.79 341.11 B: particularly kids or can be cruel 

340.76 343.44 A: yeah and it just makes it worse anyway 

342.84 354.43 B: you know when i hurt my back i don't know seven or eight years real bad and it was actually it wasn't as bad as it looked but it cert- certainly is painful but fortunately it was only a muscle kind of thing oh uh bones out of line it 

354.44 362.81 B: wasn't a disc problem but i was crooked you know uh i look i i look like uh deformed because i was leaning over one way 

362.61 363.71 A: yeah 

363.84 373.92 B: and it and i had to be that way for three months because it wouldn't unfreeze you know it was so frozen up because i didn't got to the doctor for five days and i did the wrong things 

367.14 368.53 A: wow 

374.24 377.96 B: like i you know i got in a jacuzzi and made it worse you know it felt better 

377.68 379.55 A: yeah yeah 

378.63 382.56 B: (( but it was inflaming it you know you've got to be really careful about how )) 

383.92 389.99 B: and then having that experience for three months going around in public you know people looking at me just amazing 

389.88 391.44 A: mhm 

390.82 391.98 B: comments 

391.54 394.05 A: so you got to get a taste of it 

393.42 396.60 B: comments unbelievable and boy did they 

397.70 400.41 B: uh you know and then i was afraid of being in crowds 

400.42 411.03 B: i was i'm not like i'm a physically strong person you know i i dreaded going to the grocery store because you know any random movement people movement like going in and out of a grocery store 

411.39 415.44 B: you know people don't go single file they don't go in an ordinary manner random 

413.86 415.31 A: (( [noise] right )) 

415.98 424.52 B: i wouldn't even consider getting on a bus you know it's like because all it took was like one bump and the pain was so bad and then if i'd fall forget it 

424.33 431.80 B: you know so i was so i when i see people like with a walker or moving slow or something you know and it's not like old people either 

431.81 435.63 B: i'm very careful like not to give them their space 

436.17 441.67 B: and honor them really uh it's just amazing you know like nobody likes a crip you know 

441.44 442.91 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

442.17 450.65 B: kind of thing you know they they don't have any use for ya you know i don't mean to be callous but there's too much of the population that way 'cause the stereotype is new york city 

451.00 456.11 B: you know where somebody's attacked on the street and people just ignore it keep walking 

456.24 460.57 B: that's the most callous stereotype there is but you know 

459.92 463.20 A: well there's so many in new york city that don't need to be there 

462.75 465.71 B: i don't mean to be cynical oh they don't need to be there what do you mean 

465.80 468.53 A: uh you talking about the bums on the street 

468.94 469.85 B: no 

469.39 471.30 A: oh you're talking about 

469.94 481.77 B: no the average person on the street people don't they don't wanna take it no where somebody is being attacked on the street or mugged they don't that's a it's a cliche but it's true you know i spend enough time there people don't wanna get involved 

471.69 473.55 A: oh the crippled person 

476.02 477.17 A: yeah 

481.19 483.81 A: oh i don't want to you 

482.85 489.33 B: no well nobody does and in this world it's much more dangerous you can't put your hand down to anybody even if they're in a there's a wreck you know 

483.82 485.24 A: yeah 

485.82 486.95 A: yeah 

488.97 490.51 A: yeah i know 

489.93 492.44 B: but getting back to humor um
