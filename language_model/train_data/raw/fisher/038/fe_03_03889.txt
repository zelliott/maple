58.27 59.44 A: oh okay [laughter] 

58.88 63.85 B: so [laughter] god what's acceptable 

64.09 67.12 A: (( i have a pretty broad definition of acceptable )) 

66.21 67.27 B: i do i 

67.40 69.27 B: we tend to be kind of 

69.31 71.29 B: loose with it [laughter] 

71.66 77.12 B: you know every now and then i'll have to go don- don- don't say that [laughter] but 

75.33 77.30 A: yeah i-i think it's 

77.60 83.02 A: for me at least it's really dependent on the groups i'm in because there are some groups are just not going to tell a certain joke or 

83.43 86.86 A: (( some groups where i just get uncomfortable even watching something with them )) 

83.58 84.72 B: (( [sigh] you know it )) 

86.66 89.66 B: yeah me it depends on who you're with too 

89.41 90.39 A: yeah 

90.50 91.77 B: you know i mean 

92.22 95.40 B: i mean down here you know y- y- you have to watch 

95.61 96.50 B: ah 

97.25 98.33 B: racial 

98.63 99.82 B: jokes 

99.42 100.70 A: yeah 

100.09 104.89 B: you know i'm sure that's everywhere but down south you have to really be careful 

104.68 106.36 A: yeah i believe it 

105.47 106.58 B: (( but and )) 

107.08 110.26 B: we like jokes of all kinds sick and otherwise 

110.70 111.60 B: (( you know )) 

111.89 116.57 B: [laughter] so it it it really depends on the company you're with 

116.23 118.21 A: [laughter] [mn] yeah like up here it's 

118.30 123.27 A: i mean especially because i'm still at in school it's pretty acceptable to tell jokes 

123.40 131.42 A: among your peers even the people that you work with um of of like any sort i mean they're terrible some of them but 

124.47 125.73 B: yeah 

126.35 127.38 B: right 

129.29 130.65 B: exactly 

131.25 132.30 B: no i mean 

131.45 138.67 A: people understand that it's it's a joke based on a stereotype or incident and that's where it ends 

136.73 138.52 B: right right 

139.00 141.65 B: and you and you learn um 

142.54 147.39 B: you know you know which people in the office you can't tell dirty jokes to 

146.86 148.31 A: yeah 

147.79 148.83 B: you know 

149.46 153.23 B: we're all a bunch a bunch of crudies at work [laughter] 

151.82 153.89 A: (( [laughter] )) 

154.23 155.41 B: you know i mean 

155.44 156.09 B: (( [mn] )) 

156.26 164.47 B: i mean certain things that are really explicit now you know i even i can draw the line at that but 

163.05 164.17 A: yeah 

164.73 166.19 B: your standard 

166.65 168.02 B: dirty joke 

168.12 170.32 B: sexy joke or whatever you know it's 

170.55 179.22 A: the ones that the ones that really get me though are not the you know ones with explicit words or adult themes or whatever they might want to call them but um 

170.97 172.38 B: (( it's whatever )) 

180.19 184.73 A: th- when you turn on the television a lot of the regular sitcoms the jokes are just so dumb 

182.94 183.77 B: uh-huh 

185.12 187.36 A: (( and insultingly stupid )) 

185.21 186.76 B: oh oh 

186.96 188.46 B: they're well you know 

187.53 189.16 A: that bothers me 

189.08 195.00 B: we we actually quit watching a lot of weeknight television 

195.04 197.54 B: 'cause it's just so inane 

197.36 199.70 A: yeah oh i know what you mean 

198.29 199.08 B: like 

199.47 205.33 B: i mean where there's when my husband's ah in the watching something else in the other room 

205.35 210.32 B: and i'm bored i'll put on everyone loves raymond but i want to slap him 

210.35 211.77 B: he's such a wuss 

211.23 212.92 A: [laughter] 

212.69 213.78 B: you know 

213.36 214.68 A: yeah 

213.80 214.97 B: he's such a 

215.60 217.16 B: oh god you're a weenie 

217.62 218.96 B: [laughter] 

218.06 221.22 A: well it's it's terrible because i- 

221.41 223.99 A: none of them have any sort of 

224.35 226.58 A: jokes that you have to think about any more 

226.50 231.36 B: i no no there's nothing to think about they put everything out 

227.37 228.93 A: 'cause it's so it's 

229.89 234.38 A: got to be in your face and right there and i think that's what 

231.51 232.20 B: (( [sigh] )) 

234.54 237.42 A: actually is the least acceptable to me [sigh] 

236.78 243.87 B: right right exactly i i get tired of all the blatant 

244.19 245.78 B: sexuality 

245.69 247.47 A: oh yeah definitely 

247.33 250.01 B: it's just it's not necessary 

249.57 251.27 A: and it's not funny 

251.01 252.14 B: no 

251.50 254.66 A: and usually it's not even attractive either because it's 

253.91 256.22 B: no yeah it it 

255.11 256.99 A: pushed so far 

257.23 258.08 B: i mean 

258.70 264.40 B: even [mn] if if i see another woman's tits i'm going to scream 

264.54 266.31 A: [laughter] 

265.44 274.78 B: [laughter] you know you never see them having commercials about jockettes but you're going to see commercials for for napkins and tampons 

274.04 276.21 A: yeah yeah 

275.48 278.91 B: you know and that's that's the kind of thing i think 

277.01 278.74 A: it's a little strange 

278.97 280.73 B: it's just not necessary 

281.83 285.18 B: (( and all the women are good looking )) 

285.90 290.13 B: you know big busted young and tall and pretty 

289.62 290.84 A: well of course 

290.57 292.56 B: you know e- everything 

292.73 294.41 B: uses sex 

294.44 295.60 B: to sell 

295.93 299.14 B: you know it just gets so ridiculous 

299.40 300.69 A: yeah 

299.90 305.97 B: but ah you know but i mean as far as jokes i'm i'm pretty laid back about that 

306.06 307.03 B: (( you know )) 

306.76 310.26 A: yeah i i think there's also some places where 

310.34 312.86 A: humour gets inserted where it doesn't need to be 

312.51 314.05 B: mhm mhm 

313.01 314.30 A: (( like ah )) 

314.44 319.55 A: i recently saw [laughter] an article about the carrot top and the

321.30 325.45 A: carrot top the comediennes with red hair in the [laughter] t._v. ads 

322.49 324.39 B: yeah yeah 

325.95 333.19 A: and yeah i don't think anybody likes him or likes the commercials and they just keep coming there's just more of them all the time 

326.02 327.83 B: he's he's weird 

332.66 335.42 B: [laughter] it's like did you ever grow up 

334.92 338.65 A: it's probably what they're trying to do though i mean look whoever it was 

338.83 340.31 A: (( [laughter] remember the )) 

340.04 345.24 B: [laughter] he's probably never been with a girl you know and it's it's like oh my god

345.09 345.70 A: [mn]

352.34 354.17 B: but you know but that's 

354.49 355.43 A: yeah 

354.64 356.38 B: that's you know

359.59 361.20 B: yeah 

362.60 364.43 A: i- i'm coming at it with a 

364.27 365.45 B: (( [sigh] mhm ))

384.13 385.60 B: (( mhm ))

496.52 500.46 B: and in the no- nothing really shocks me so 

500.86 501.82 A: i think 

500.91 504.85 B: mixed mixed company or anything that- that doesn't bother me 

504.37 505.85 A: one of the things that's 

505.91 507.50 A: that i find 

508.94 512.45 A: like about comedy is is that um 

512.61 520.21 A: sometimes i'll be watching something with my mother i mean i'm still like twenty one i go home and then i watch something with my mother and sometimes i just feel 

520.15 531.46 A: you know so uncomfortable watching something because i know she's i know what she's thinking about them [laughter] and i don't want to know 'cause i thought it was funny and she thinks it's just terribly inappropriate and how can i think that's funny 

522.13 523.60 B: [sigh] right 

525.33 526.44 B: yeah

552.64 557.57 A: i i think i mean my parents well my mother at least is pretty open i think for a lot of people it might be 

557.54 558.47 B: uh-huh 

558.03 563.16 A: even more awkward ah 'cause some of my friends have very conservative parents and 

562.34 564.01 B: right right 

563.23 569.10 A: this isn't a very conservative area so they sort of encounter new things when they come here 

568.91 570.23 B: yeah 

569.53 573.76 A: and their parents come and visit and they see the you know the murals on the walls and they're going like

593.43 594.53 B: (( [laughter] )) 

596.81 598.70 B: yeah yeah 

599.11 599.90 B: (( i i i ))
