250.93 262.37 B: i'd i mean i just i i like to laugh but you know some of the stuff it just [noise] just kinda goes over the line like you said with the the racial slurs and 

261.48 262.61 A: (( mhm )) 

262.60 265.79 B: you know and stuff like that that's just a bit too much 

265.64 276.44 A: uh-huh so do you know if the government or institutes in the united states are doing anything to change that their their you know guidelines to the government or 

275.83 285.30 B: i'm not sure about that it's i i think a lot of it has to do with the movie industry and basically what people want to see 

285.52 292.00 B: you know they throwing a lot of stuff out there that seventeen and eighteen teenagers basically wanna see 

285.64 286.55 A: yeah 

291.67 293.87 A: yeah that's true 

292.14 297.40 B: and it a a lot of what they throw out there in as far as movies and shows and stuff 

297.47 302.89 B: is basically would be unacceptable to our parents when we were growing up 

302.56 305.88 A: yes yes that is right 

305.85 309.33 A: yeah but i have heard that uh there is kind of a 

309.31 321.90 A: censorship office or censorship movement in the united states and maybe they can do something about these and give us some uh i don't know an outcome or a or a solution to these 

311.24 312.31 B: mhm 

321.82 328.07 A: you know but anyway you are right there are some things on t._v. in the movies where 

328.25 334.57 A: things that are not appropriate for us not for our parents not for our children not for everyone 

333.00 333.99 B: (( [noise] right )) 

334.23 345.60 B: right like i said there are some shows out there some comedy shows or some comedy movies that you know i i wouldn't let my mother watch and you know my mother's old enough to make up her own mind [laughter] but 

334.71 335.54 A: yeah 

341.53 342.39 A: yeah 

344.32 354.84 A: [laughter] yeah you're right my mother is kind of picky about that too even though she lives in peru and uh we have the same problem in our country you know uh 

348.94 349.79 B: (( [noise] )) 

355.03 356.59 A: bad things on t._v. 

356.86 361.12 A: and talk shows where everything is is showed and 

358.69 360.00 B: mhm 

360.75 361.85 B: right 

361.26 362.97 A: it's every 

363.14 367.29 A: (( all these can be country the socialist countries on t._v. )) 

366.27 373.02 B: i think that well actually i think that's the problem no matter where you go and no matter where you live 

370.92 371.91 A: yeah 

371.99 375.72 A: (( it's an international thing it's an international thing uh-huh )) 

373.41 375.53 B: right i mean unless you 

375.37 389.41 B: unless you live in a country where everything is so tightly controlled you know things are gonna things are gonna get through shows that are not politically correct and and just kinda go over the line and 

387.89 401.18 A: yeah but that is only talk you know we cannot have a country like that [laughter] it wouldn't very we wouldn't be free enough to make our own decisions and that of course of course 

391.62 392.74 B: [laughter] 

392.90 393.95 B: (( oh )) 

395.54 396.71 B: that 

397.04 399.40 B: but that would that would be boring 

399.84 402.26 B: [laughter] 

401.41 409.97 A: yeah you know what i think the free agencies that you have is one of the most important things you have been given so you you need to learn how to use it 

409.55 410.90 B: [laughter] well that's true 

410.52 420.20 A: that's true so you you have bad things and the good ones and you have to be wise enough to choose the good ones and help your family and your community you 

419.91 421.11 B: well that's true 

421.68 428.44 B: you have to just uh know what you want to watch and uh how far you're willing to 

428.53 429.52 A: (( know uh-huh )) 

428.81 434.99 B: how far you're what you're willing to accept as far as good and bad 

433.87 437.63 A: yeah yeah you're right i i agree with that too 

438.28 447.58 A: but anyway uh as i said before i like watching your shows over here not because they have bad implications but because of the language 

447.51 457.93 A: see that doesn't mean that i am using those swearing words in my every day interaction with other people but [laughter] it's just to get to know something so when 

457.76 463.87 A: somebody insults me i will be able to not to respond but to be aware of what that person said to me 

460.75 461.34 B: (( mhm )) 

463.09 466.11 B: you'll be able to understand it [laughter] 

464.30 472.83 A: yeah i'll understand and say hey what's the problem over here do you want me to kill you or split your head or whatever [laughter] i'm just kidding of course 

469.61 471.42 B: [laughter] 

472.07 473.67 B: no don't wanna do that 

473.62 477.70 A: no no no i don't wanna do that yeah 

475.22 477.62 B: [laughter] but uh 

477.94 484.56 A: yeah but um i i like it i mean i i enjoy watching t._v. and um 

485.17 492.53 A: from time to time my wife and i just uh rent a video or get a video from the library and just uh play it 

491.56 492.45 B: mhm 

492.72 504.83 A: and sometimes our kids watch it with us and when there is something inappropriate my wife just elbows me and say eh eh eh so i just yeah i i just pass i just stop it and just 

499.48 500.29 B: (( [laughter] )) 

500.47 501.67 B: hit pause 

504.26 505.26 B: right 

505.04 510.22 A: fast forward it until we get some other scene and we're gone 

508.82 509.67 B: (( uh-huh )) 

510.70 512.35 B: i've done that 

511.64 513.79 A: yeah that's the kind of you know 

513.82 525.44 A: or maybe that's a movie i've seen before and i know that something inappropriate is coming up so okay you say eh just go away and answer the phone or just wash your hands or put on your pajamas so 

524.96 526.61 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

525.38 530.36 A: i just fast forward the movie and then when they come back we just go on watching it [laughter] 

529.71 531.21 B: (( yeah )) 

530.54 533.23 A: (( [laughter] it's a kind of a strategy also )) 

532.74 536.24 B: just kind of get them uh get them away for a little bit to 

535.41 536.87 A: (( yes )) 

536.48 540.10 B: where something would more appropriate pops up 

539.49 546.08 A: mhm but we insist on them watching those other shows kind of cartoons or 

543.89 545.36 B: yeah we have 

546.28 548.67 A: which i which they enjoy a lot 

547.95 552.57 B: right well when you have children you know when you have little ones you have to 

552.66 554.52 B: you have to be very careful

562.11 566.90 A: unfortunately that that's the way the world is nowadays you know 

566.74 568.08 B: yeah that's true 

567.78 570.01 A: some people just choose to 

570.05 577.37 A: show things on t._v. that are not good and we have to be aware of that and just guide our children 

577.50 583.71 A: and just advise them and counsel them so they can make their decisions in the right way so 

583.90 586.03 B: right yeah they uh 

586.13 587.10 B: um
