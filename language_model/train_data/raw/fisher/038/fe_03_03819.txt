0.64 2.87 B: hi this is dave from new york 

2.57 6.06 A: uh this is dennis in kansas city 

6.25 7.43 B: (( how're you doing today )) 

7.34 9.83 A: fine did you say you were in new york 

9.51 11.09 B: yeah manhattan new york 

10.86 20.83 A: oh i see well let's see the the topic is supposed to be comedy when do you draw the line between uh something being funny and something being tasteless 

20.51 22.45 B: yeah 

21.49 22.54 A: uh 

22.73 25.08 A: well i pardon 

23.12 23.93 B: (( to get )) 

25.33 26.86 B: oh go go go 

26.84 29.32 A: no you go ahead 

28.84 34.67 B: well i think it's different for everybody i mean there's acceptable i mean there's lines that you know everybody has 

34.69 43.46 B: personal you know preferences of what's funny and what's not but i think generally for most people like something personal when you're talking about somebody's family 

37.81 39.39 A: yeah 

43.58 45.49 B: um like stereo like 

45.75 50.65 B: stereotypical humor gets some people annoyed stuff like that 

49.97 61.27 A: well yeah i i think it probably a lot depends on the circumstances if you're it depends if you're with a group of uh family members or if you're with a group of uh 

61.12 71.78 A: friends or strangers i mean i suppose the circumstances would be uh the the the environment you're in probably plays an important part of it too 

71.93 74.51 B: definitely i have i have to agree with that i mean 

74.84 83.38 B: a joke a joke about my mother from my dad is different from like one of my friends one of my acquaintances saying something the same joke 

83.35 86.00 A: yeah i think uh 

83.69 84.50 B: (( you know )) 

85.91 93.12 A: it depends and it depends you know like if there's racial or ethnic jokes it depends on the uh 

92.94 101.12 A: for instance if you've got a a a black friend and you're really good friends and you really know one another really really well 

100.94 110.00 A: you could maybe make a comment a joke you know concerning black people that might offend some people but it wouldn't offend him but like i said it depends on the people you're with 

109.92 111.71 B: mhm 

110.72 116.49 A: and everybody has their own degree of tolerance too you know s- s- some people just don't have a sense of humor 

116.85 131.06 A: period and and and some people do and some people are easily offended it's it's it's one of those it's one of those areas that covers such a broad spectrum that uh you in other words you really have to know who you're with before you say anything 

130.60 135.34 B: mhm yeah well i mean when when people get angry about 

131.85 133.39 A: (( you know yeah )) 

135.73 137.90 B: (( you know certain comedians )) 

137.92 139.39 B: holding shows 

139.57 141.91 B: like et cetera et cetera i mean 

142.26 151.60 B: that's up to them just to you know turn it off and not listen to it but i don't i don't i don't find it like a justifiable cause to go out and like personally attack 

151.63 155.34 B: a certain comedian i mean what they might be saying is not 

155.41 159.41 B: something that particularly particular to your liking 

159.57 167.65 B: or it's not you know it doesn't fit you know your ideas of what say certain groups would be or you know for instance russian people or mex- 

167.71 168.98 B: or canadians 

169.30 173.85 B: and whatever i mean that's up to them you know to change the channel not listen to it 

173.86 179.69 A: i i think there's also a difference between uh a vicious uh a vicious 

179.55 192.32 A: k- kind of comedy and a more or less just a funny kind of comedy i mean like there's this uh comedian that was popular three or four years ago uh clay i forget his whole name um clay something 

192.44 197.41 A: he he he attacked a lot of people on in a way that offended a lot of people 

197.47 199.11 B: mhm 

197.69 198.68 A: uh 

198.93 207.80 A: i'm trying to think i wish i could remember he kind of faded from the scene but he got quite famous for it you know his uh comedy uh his either i his first 

207.58 215.96 A: either clay was his first name or last name i c- can't remember but but you know like johnny car- uh johnny carson and uh jay leno 

214.58 215.61 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

215.79 217.56 B: mhm 

215.86 220.67 A: and david letterman they poke fun at the politicians they poke fun at the 

220.63 227.77 A: different famous people but they do in such a way that i personally don't find it offensive i just find it funny 

227.74 235.73 A: and and in many ways there's a lot of truth to what they say but it's not a it's not a vicious or vindictive truth it's just a funny truth 

236.33 239.71 A: you know so i don't those people don't bother me at all 

236.74 237.90 B: well 

239.51 244.59 B: i i think i think that they're like they're conforming to like the television network 

244.44 249.65 A: yeah they they yeah they have to watch their step too you know you've got to be awful careful because uh 

244.65 245.95 B: (( what they have to say )) 

247.90 248.73 B: yeah 

249.98 255.46 A: the networks are owned nowadays by large uh conglomerates 

255.39 257.09 B: mhm 

256.17 265.03 A: which is another subject a person could spend a lot of time talking now with the way the news media seems to be uh in the hands of just a few very powerful 

265.18 266.16 B: yeah 

265.41 269.17 A: so that's a problem too i think you know with comedy 

267.87 274.48 B: well yeah well news news i think news is more inappropriate than you know 

274.72 279.91 B: 'cause you're not gonna to you're not gonna change the channel you know during like news 

278.81 281.10 A: (( no mhm )) 

279.99 283.84 B: i mean whatever whatever they say you're gonna take it for truth 

284.12 284.98 A: mhm 

284.21 290.35 B: i don't know i think i think the war in iraq the way they're following it or the way they covered it is very subjective 

290.33 291.38 A: yeah 

290.80 292.75 B: you know it's very one sided 

292.97 298.59 B: i mean don't get me wrong i'm not i'm not anti american anti war or anything 

298.89 304.32 B: of that nature but i mean just the way that we're projecting ourselves doesn't doesn't seen to fit 

304.37 312.48 B: you know and it doesn't seem like you know i think we're making it i think i think the media is making it that we're always you know kind of right in 

311.22 312.22 A: mhm 

312.41 319.77 A: yeah this was this was the most media war that we've ever had i think uh 

312.78 314.17 B: everything that we do 

319.87 334.72 A: and uh i during the first war over there the media was kinda kept at a distance and people weren't really aware of what was going on but the pentagon seem to have a a greater hold on on the information 

334.86 337.53 A: this time they let the media go in 

337.84 349.30 A: but the media for the most part was you know a like a rallying point you know for the war like a cheerleading squad more or less and and of course you had a couple of um 

343.01 344.84 B: mhm 

347.03 348.20 B: yeah 

349.32 362.34 A: you had a couple of newsmen who made comments that offended a lot of people and one was fired and let me see uh that peter arnett i think i think that was one who worked for c._n._n. or one of those cable channels 

361.62 364.49 B: yeah 

362.84 376.29 A: and that well he maybe did step over the line a little bit because he i think he made some statements that weren't totally true you know and he said things were going bad and it was a total disaster and it's true things got bogged down for a few days but 

376.24 388.84 A: you know i mean i think he portrayed like it was just you know a whole mess and a total disaster which it it wasn't i think i think he had a he was expressing his opinion more or less i don't think it was based on on fact you know 

388.87 390.65 B: mhm 

389.13 398.11 A: so i wish the news media would just you know try to stick to the facts and try to keep their own personal feelings out of it 

396.09 400.85 B: well i mean i personally like i i don't think i mean ever since 

400.91 405.68 B: ever since vietnam i mean the the american public has been very skeptical 

402.87 403.96 A: yeah 

405.45 406.89 A: yeah yeah 

406.16 408.47 B: of the media at best i mean 

408.83 413.88 B: i mean up until i mean the last year or two i mean they said everything was going to be fine 

413.48 414.78 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

414.14 426.88 B: et cetera et cetera i mean they're just showing you know they're just they're portraying the war as like you know kill counts and the number of bodies as as progressing forward when that wasn't even like the scenarios being played 

420.65 422.58 A: yeah 

427.19 428.28 A: yeah 

427.43 429.24 B: also with iraq i mean 

429.30 430.79 B: (( i don't i mean )) 

430.88 441.85 B: where do you draw the line i mean i mean how how far is a reporter gonna go i mean how much are they showing there's too much you know they're showing you know what happens if somebody you know if some iraqi 

432.83 434.39 A: yeah 

437.90 438.88 A: yeah 

442.30 449.34 B: general soldier goes on t._v. and they just look they look beh- they look somewhere in the background we know where they are i mean 

447.16 448.98 A: yeah yeah 

450.01 459.40 A: i think and i remember the vietnam war and i think the news media in some way uh uh helped to bring that to an end because the news media was over there and they 

459.40 468.18 A: they weren't really anti war and they weren't really pro war i think the news media did a pretty good job if i remember right of reporting in vietnam but they 

468.09 470.47 A: they got down to the level of the 

470.39 471.99 A: the soldier 

471.82 486.66 A: and they were talking to the individual soldiers you know and and by by going down and talking to them you know they kinda you kinda got the impression that things weren't quite the same up above with the generals as it was down below with the men you know there was kind of a 

485.97 487.72 B: mhm 

486.92 497.85 A: uh and i think there was more and more truth coming out that things weren't you know quite as hunky dorey as the government was leading us but even of course now we know the government did lie to us a lot about that so 

497.80 509.70 A: but uh of course like uh but getting back to this humor deal i mean you take like don rickles i know somebody i've had people tell me they don't like don rickles because he insults everybody and he's a nasty man 

509.59 510.47 B: mhm 

509.61 520.68 A: well i don't i think he's really funny i don't think he insults people he does insult people but he does it in a he's just doing it in a joking way but i think people take him so seriously 

518.56 519.49 B: yeah 

520.89 534.68 B: well it's always understand that comedy i mean comedian's profession it's a livelihood i mean if some if you're not always on the edge if you're not on the ball if you're not if you're not like intriguing the crowd i mean 

524.96 526.32 A: yeah 

534.25 535.19 A: mhm 

534.55 536.42 B: infamy i mean 

536.71 542.79 B: sometimes could be you know as good as just being you know just telling just good old jokes i mean 

540.46 541.53 A: mhm 

542.95 552.40 B: i mean sometimes you know comedians like to be like hated the thing is popularity i mean you're not i mean you could watch them you know the whole hour they have their comedy special 

552.13 553.20 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

552.33 561.44 B: and you could be like well i hate them i mean i don't agree with what they're saying but those are people who are actually watching it i mean for instance take like howard stern 

561.46 564.11 B: i mean there's people i mean like 

564.89 571.45 B: maybe a quarter of the listeners out there don't agree with anything he says but i mean they'll they're listening to it though 

571.87 578.81 A: yeah that's true too i i think uh uh there's some comedians do seem to be kind of vicious in a way 

578.71 589.01 A: and then some seem to be more or less like your don rickles they kinda vicious but in a less sharp less hostile way so it's a fine line you're walking there you know 

588.94 599.89 A: and that so you have to be real careful uh c- comedy is uh is very scientific very technical in many ways and and uh you know like you know so it's just one of those things i mean 

596.49 597.31 B: (( [noise] ))
