1.19 5.84 B: hi i'm linda i'm linda [laughter] go ahead 

1.42 3.96 A: hello oh hi lind- 

4.38 7.26 A: [mn] hi linda my my name's janevra 

7.49 8.86 B: nice to meet you 

9.00 10.75 B: would you like to start 

10.67 17.55 A: uh sure so what is it ah comedy where do we draw the line between what's ah acceptable and what's bad taste 

16.88 19.28 B: that's correct what do you think about it 

18.96 32.05 A: well i think it really i think well i think that my perspective on that has changed as i got as i've gotten older i'm thirty three right so when i was young when saturday night live was first on television 

31.96 34.39 A: and my parents used to watch it 

34.27 48.55 A: and sometimes um oh what was his name [lipsmack] uh there's a there was a writer for the show who always wrote these really dark things and they would like be very violent and i would think like that's not funny that's not funny 

49.13 51.76 A: or like andy kaufman for instance 

50.57 52.10 B: right right 

51.71 62.41 A: um i always thought like that's not i don't get it like what's with the women's wrestling it's not funny [laughter] [laughter] and ah it would like make me really angry but now 

57.06 58.45 B: [laughter] 

62.30 69.52 A: i think that that stuff is really funny i guess in terms of bad taste 

69.75 74.15 A: i [sigh] it really depends on the audience you know like 

73.95 87.51 A: there are certain jokes i guess i can't think of one of course but that i you know would only feel comfortable telling to people who i feel already have an opinion of me and it won't be changed by a joke um well 

87.51 102.08 A: i guess that i can't think of one now but and i guess like it's a matter of personal preference like i might not think jokes about feminists are funny well that depends on the joke right or racist jokes or 

98.53 99.43 B: right 

102.19 108.15 A: [lipsmack] um ah so i don't i don't know you you you go [laughter] 

106.57 115.68 B: okay well i'm i'm old enough to be your mother because i'm fifty three so i'm probably one of those mothers that was watching when you were just starting watching saturday night live 

112.66 115.55 A: [laughter] 

115.49 123.63 B: and interestingly enough i thought it was very funny then and i no longer find it funny because i think i'm a little too old to be the target audience 

123.45 125.39 A: oh wow that is interesting 

123.50 127.99 B: but as far as whether it's acceptable or not it depends 

127.86 142.41 B: obviously on what kind of a mood i'm in and also who i'm with because i will laugh uproariously at something when my son is in the room that isn't funny otherwise but i don't what i don't funny are the gross 

142.63 151.69 B: tearing bodies apart blood spurting humor that seems to be sort of par for the course on saturday night live and those kind of shows now 

148.31 150.20 A: oh right like the 

151.41 156.36 A: the the m._t._v. movie jackass right well i haven't seen it but 

154.71 155.70 B: (( well no )) 

155.65 164.70 B: i don't get it [laughter] i understand what you're talking about but also anything about race weight gender 

164.64 173.59 B: can be funny or not depending upon whether you're on the receiving end or not and who you're with so that's a big part of it for me 

168.85 169.98 A: mhm 

174.46 175.39 B: um 

174.71 185.90 A: i guess you know i tend to like pick apart these questions like i think well [mn] acceptable unacceptable what does that mean like i i don't think that anything should be not allowed 

185.79 190.51 A: i just you know i may not find it funny 

190.58 191.42 A: um 

191.42 205.93 A: and it's you know it's funny as i've gotten older i've come to appreciate sort of safe comedy like bob hope or johnny carson [laughter] you know what i mean like when i was younger i thought like 

201.22 202.82 B: [laughter] 

203.21 204.38 B: i do 

206.02 213.92 A: oh they're really boring i don't get it but now i think like oh that's nice like it's comforting [laughter] 

213.13 223.16 B: well i yeah and i understand that too i think as far as acceptable and you are right we were kind of getting off the subject there acceptable is whether or not it offends someone is where i draw the line 

222.97 232.93 B: and that person doesn't have to be with me for me to be offended by humor that i consider unacceptable i just cannot tolerate racist humor when it's when it's not done 

233.05 239.27 B: i i don't even wanna say there's a right way to do it but maybe there is but generally it is not funny [laughter] 

233.30 234.77 A: when it's not funny 

236.03 238.67 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

238.71 248.45 A: right it's i mean you know i i think it depends on how um [lipsmack] gently it pokes fun at stereotypes 

247.85 249.02 B: that's right 

248.90 261.86 A: and and whether or not it's funny like i had i remember i remember this very well i was working in a market like a flea market and one of the other marketers told me this racist joke that like not only was 

262.11 272.39 A: racist but was not even funny like at all at all at all i was just like [mn] i don't get it [laughter] and i never forgot of course i never forgot the joke because it wasn't funny 

272.21 278.81 A: and and then i thought like oh god people really think that way like how weird that i'm 

278.65 287.95 A: white and like a part of this ex- exclusive crew that i didn't ask to be a part of like it just made me think of all sorts of things 

287.53 297.27 B: it is f- that that's also true and i think um anything that has to do with your race black white or otherwise when i was growing up i was in nebraska and we always told 

297.11 309.90 B: polack jokes because that was funny i didn't know any polish people at the time well we moved to michigan detroit is full of polish people you don't tell polack jokes in detroit they're not funny any more 

298.28 299.58 A: right of course 

300.84 301.86 A: right 

307.17 308.85 A: [laughter] 

309.71 323.34 B: so it moved into the unacceptable humor category for me where it still stays i mean that's a maturing process is learning that there are people that that actually offended because i just thought they were made up people somewhere when i was a kid i think 

323.21 332.89 A: well everybody has their equivalent of polish people you know for the french it's the bal dens and for the um like my husband is from 

333.39 347.87 A: [mn] illinois right and i think for like people from minnesota it's people from wisconsin and for people from wisconsin it's people from minnesota [laughter] like their equivalent [laughter] you know for 

343.67 345.54 B: (( yeah that's right it is true )) 

346.55 352.04 B: and in texas it's the aggies that's where i'm from right now that's where i'm living right now and we 

351.07 352.32 A: in where 

351.92 361.91 B: in texas and since i'm in austin we tell aggie jokes and those are the same jokes that we grew up with as a kid telling about the polish people identical jokes it's funny when they're about the aggies but they're no longer funny when they're about the polish i think that's it 

361.92 362.82 A: right 

362.00 366.44 B: (( [laughter] right do you happen to be blonde well um no i'm actually not blonde although i bleached )) 

366.49 372.95 A: well it is i mean it's sort of about some fictional really dumb people but they're like blonde jokes 

370.37 371.63 B: (( my hair quite often to )) 

372.30 375.07 B: (( that kind of white blonde so even though i'm not blonde i )) 

374.81 389.10 A: (( and but i was ne- but i was never offended by blonde jokes )) 

383.80 385.13 B: ((  )) 

388.96 395.49 A: because [mn] i you know i know they're not stupid you know i just they're absurd 

394.55 400.46 B: [laughter] and i don't think anyone's offended by blonde jokes so they're not unacceptable to me they're just funny and stupid 

397.01 397.99 A: right 

400.64 401.55 A: right 

402.86 412.39 A: and it's i forgot about those jackass movies i you know this is how i know i'm getting older like i don't understand what the kids are into [laughter] 

410.16 412.80 B: [laughter] and i think you are a kid 

412.56 414.56 A: (( [laughter] i know )) 

412.69 425.62 B: um but i don't get it and i do know some friends whose children have seen it and think it's the most uproariously funny thing but yet they're taking chances with their lives in some cases that isn't funny either 

426.59 428.77 A: yeah i kind of i mean 

429.02 440.79 A: yeah i don't i don't know i don't know i haven't seen them so i don't know i just i i and i know i wasn't interested in seeing them but i did have some friends who thought it was the funniest thing i know i listened well i don't 

440.60 445.18 A: these days i go back and forth with it but i listen to howard stern in the morning sometimes 

444.77 445.65 B: right 

445.54 458.07 A: it's a guilty pleasure of mine although it's really not the same since he got divorced [laughter] and i you know he causes a lot of furor um 

446.87 447.69 B: right 

450.40 452.97 B: [laughter] i understand 

458.13 462.14 A: [lipsmack] ah [mn] and i guess he offends a lot of 

462.21 473.26 A: people including myself i mean that's why i listen to him on and off like i know i have to stop listening when i start thinking i need a boob job [laughter] um but ah 

469.46 471.87 B: [laughter] 

473.23 484.82 A: and and and it's funny because i really think that like part of why i enjoyed listening to him for a while is that i didn't believe and like i believed that his whole shtick was an act 

485.03 486.01 B: right 

485.52 492.02 A: and so that like even though he says these outrageous potentially unacceptable things 

492.17 501.16 A: i thought it was all a act so it didn't really matter i could think it was funny instead of being offended by it that i would have if i thought he really believed it 

500.93 512.73 B: well that's true and if you want to go the other direction you can go to conservative talk radio like rush limbaugh also purely entertainment it is pretty offensive to me to listen to 

506.35 507.81 A: oh yeah 

510.64 513.07 A: it's true i used to listen to rush limbaugh too 

512.65 523.09 B: but it's also funny for much the same reason because it is entertainment and i know that a lot of people take that very seriously though which makes it offensive and maybe borderline for me 

523.15 536.91 A: yeah i would listen to rush on car trips like when i couldn't get anything else and i would find myself yelling at that radio but very entertaining it's true [laughter] 

531.41 533.20 B: [laughter] 

535.77 536.87 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

536.65 547.19 B: i don't know the only thing that is totally acceptable to me in whatever form is a pun and i that's supposedly the lowest form of humor but i also find it the very funniest i love words 

546.99 552.88 B: and i don't think you can hurt anyone by making a funny j- a puny joke with some words 

551.99 553.02 A: right 

553.09 556.30 B: none of which of course i can come up with right now so it's kinda 

555.18 564.69 A: well here's my favorite joke that's sort of a pun and it's partly my favorite because it took me way too long to get it where does the king keep his armies 

565.33 566.96 B: uh i don't know 

566.88 568.67 A: in his sleevies 

568.45 573.47 B: oh that's baddy [laughter] i like that very good 

572.15 575.08 A: (( [laughter] )) 

574.03 574.85 B: well 

575.39 580.03 B: i think we've agreed on um what's acceptable sort of haven't we 

579.90 581.33 A: i think so 

580.13 584.81 B: do you have anything else exciting to add to this topic i'm pretty much exhausted 

584.50 587.09 A: [laughter] so you're in texas 

586.38 588.19 B: i am and where are you 

588.04 589.60 A: i'm in new york city 

589.20 592.10 B: oh gosh we couldn't be much different could we 

591.50 597.92 A: [laughter] and um is this the first or is this this isn't your first conversation i can tell 

596.45 598.85 B: no it isn't is it yours 

598.39 599.64 A: uh no 

599.14 599.89 B: no
