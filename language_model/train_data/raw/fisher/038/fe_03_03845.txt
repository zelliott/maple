0.89 2.01 A: hello 

1.60 2.88 B: hello 

3.37 5.46 A: hi my name is sandy 

4.12 4.98 B: i'm 

5.10 6.28 B: sandy 

6.06 7.00 A: (( mhm )) 

6.64 7.97 B: my name's amanda 

8.26 10.44 A: and i live in california 

9.77 12.22 B: oh me too where at california 

11.63 12.76 A: uh san jose 

12.65 14.20 B: oh okay i'm in santa rosa 

14.26 19.62 A: oh you're not that far away i have friends of mine that live there but that's probably not on topic 

15.38 16.13 B: (( uh-huh )) 

18.66 21.57 B: uh probably not i guess that's comedy 

19.90 20.52 A: [laughter] 

21.68 25.74 B: how do you f- what was it how do you figure out what's appropriate with comedy 

26.19 27.03 A: uh 

28.05 30.91 A: well i guess for the most part if i'm watching them 

31.03 34.03 A: if you feel pissed off it's probably not appropriate oh 

33.49 40.43 B: yeah i guess i would say if i felt like kids could be in the room it's probably appropriate [laughter] 

39.76 49.46 A: that's true although you know there are more adult types of comedy that you know if there weren't any kids in the room would would be appropriate for the uh audience i suppose 

49.02 62.22 B: that's true that's true and there's also you know things that i i do think are funny but i don't think it's appropriate when my parents are around because then it just doesn't feel very funny any more so i guess it's whoever the audience that's going to watch it 

61.04 65.06 A: [laughter] right well i've seen stuff like that especially like around the office 

65.12 65.99 B: mhm 

65.19 71.49 A: when someone makes a joke that's kind of on the edge you know it might be kind of sexually oriented or 

68.49 69.56 B: yeah 

71.50 77.46 A: a little inappropriate you know you kind of look around to see if anyone's getting in a before you laugh 

77.12 81.81 B: yeah totally 'cause you think it's funny but then everyone else are like oh that's just terrible 

81.86 88.79 A: well i have a really morbid sense of humor too so things i would find funny other people might go oh my god that's appalling 

83.88 84.82 B: [laughter] 

88.61 90.54 B: (( okay yeah i see that )) 

89.33 90.07 A: but 

90.50 94.59 A: but there's there's times in life i guess where you know you either laugh or cry 

95.06 96.05 A: and 

95.26 97.64 B: that is true and why not laugh 

98.77 102.00 A: well sometimes you've just done enough crying i suppose 

101.63 103.10 B: yeah 

103.51 108.90 A: well yes like where i work right now we've gone through i don't know how many rounds of layoffs 

108.55 110.33 B: oh yeah 

109.66 111.54 A: but we have a lot of 

111.95 114.57 A: really dry workplace humor going on 

114.46 116.49 B: yeah you have to to get through it 

114.77 115.75 A: and 

116.65 118.24 A: (( you know it's )) 

118.44 126.89 A: one one minute everything's going fine and the next minute they're laying that much more people off so you just kind of stand there and wave at them as they leave with their box of stuff 

126.42 128.32 B: yeah i completely understand 

127.11 128.91 A: and then you make jokes about them [laughter] 

129.46 131.64 A: (( which would be inappropriate in front of them )) 

131.31 133.10 B: [laughter] it would be 

133.20 134.20 B: (( but )) 

134.21 138.31 B: behind them it helps you guys cope with it and deal with it 

139.87 143.97 A: so i think th- that's a lot of what people refer to as inappropriate humor 

143.63 144.66 B: mhm 

144.04 149.69 A: it's maybe it's not the humor itself isn't inappropriate but might be inappropriate for the situation 

149.88 150.92 B: yeah 

150.03 153.95 A: 'cause i think humor is is two sided there's the 

154.11 157.17 A: the delivery and then there's the reception 

157.22 159.93 A: and both have to be [mn] 

160.01 161.66 A: i guess in sync 

161.53 163.03 B: yeah definitely 

162.77 166.34 A: 'cause yeah someone fifteen different people could tell the same joke 

166.69 169.62 A: and some people it would be funny and some people it wouldn't 

169.53 170.62 B: definitely 

169.88 172.82 A: some people it just sounds just sounds gross 

172.87 174.59 A: i've done most of 

172.91 173.78 B: (( oh yeah )) 

174.87 175.87 A: oh go ahead 

175.65 181.46 B: well i was thinking of like um standup comedians when it's like [mn] uh maybe a hispanic actor 

181.45 182.37 A: (( mhm )) 

181.77 189.35 B: making fun of other hispanics that's appropriate but it wouldn't be appropriate for a white person to do the same joke 

185.25 186.16 A: well it's 

189.43 194.78 A: right i think that has a lot to do with our society as well there are certain things that it's okay to laugh at 

194.41 195.73 B: mhm 

195.35 197.44 A: you know like for for a while it's 

198.07 203.39 A: [mn] you know you couldn't make fun of black people because you know that would be inappropriate topic of the 

203.55 209.03 A: (( du jour you know and then then you people going like oh stereotyping went out but it was still okay to make fun of fat people in the same way )) 

208.84 211.62 B: and rednecks yeah yes 

208.94 221.21 A: you could basically just yeah and rednecks you can just take out take out the adjectives and then replace it with something else that's more approved in society and all of a sudden the humor becomes appropriate i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm not 

218.38 219.47 B: totally 

221.30 224.91 A: as amused by that sort of humor i much prefer situational humor 

224.57 225.69 B: definitely 

225.34 226.96 A: which tends to be 

227.42 238.16 A: i think more amusing but some of the topics can be inappropriate based on the audience you know it starts off you get you start off with your toilet humor and you know you most people 

238.29 242.47 A: stop laughing at that when they're like in kindergarten [laughter] but 

240.79 242.96 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

243.02 246.67 A: but that's the start of you know i think situational humor and 

247.42 253.23 A: and as as you get older i mean it's it's appropriate and it's funny as long as you're not going through it 

253.02 254.74 B: mhm that's true 

254.61 267.91 A: i i have you know i know friends who will tell jokes about you know going to funerals and having you know your friends and relatives die or stuff like that which is it can be very funny except if your mother just died [laughter] maybe not so much 

266.32 267.81 B: [laughter] yeah 

267.94 271.83 B: yep then it's not appropriate 'cause you're just in too much pain ex- 

271.61 276.72 A: yeah but how does a comedian know that you know for a general audience i don't think you can 

276.47 290.82 B: totally you can't well i mean you're not going to make everyone laugh anyway if you're a comedian you have to accept that your jokes will make your your hopes are going to make most people laugh [laughter] they're going to be a few that are going to be offended and or just not think it's funny 

277.65 278.48 A: (( i think )) 

287.19 287.90 A: right 

290.93 294.83 A: well i i i think that that could be part of the nature of humor too as well i 

294.40 295.84 B: yeah 

295.42 298.78 A: mean you're you're pointing out that which is 

300.45 301.33 A: different 

301.84 305.46 A: or unusual i mean you're making you know some humor is observational 

305.37 306.28 B: mhm 

305.54 311.28 A: and they're you know they're pointing out these things that you know they're pointing out something about you know a dog 

311.41 316.01 A: people are like ha ha that's funny but if you point out the same sort of behavior in a person 

317.12 320.88 A: and that person's there or [mn] that group of people are there 

321.08 323.06 A: they would feel it was inappropriate [laughter] 

322.35 325.11 B: they feel it's inappropriate or even if um 

325.38 340.12 B: they just had no idea what you're talking about if you're a comedian you get up there and you make a bunch of jokes about how hard is to be married and your entire audience is like a singles' club [laughter] they have no idea what you're talking about [laughter] they have no reference yeah they're like well this is dumb 

337.12 339.45 A: and probably don't care right 

340.25 341.59 B: they don't even know it 

342.49 349.96 A: well i think that that might be why we don't find ah racial humor as funny when it comes from someone of a different group 

350.26 351.36 B: yeah 

350.28 358.98 A: 'cause you know if a white guy's making mexican jokes you're like well he's just prejudiced what does he know about m- eating mexican whereas if a mexican guy's making the same jokes 

354.84 355.64 B: (( uh )) 

358.84 360.83 B: he knows it yeah 

359.04 359.99 A: you're like well 

360.16 363.53 A: he yeah he must have some basis of understanding there 

363.27 364.76 B: totally 

364.64 368.62 A: and i think it would depend also if he was just trying if he was just going for the laugh 

368.69 375.41 A: like if he had a pre- predominantly white audience and he was just making stereotypical mexican mexican jokes because he thought he had an audience of rednecks 

375.06 377.07 B: mhm 

376.09 387.28 A: i think that'd be kind of uncomfortable you know to be in that audience [laughter] whereas whereas if you know there were there was a good proportion of the that same kind of people that he was making fun of and then they found humor in that it'd 

378.28 379.36 B: very [laughter] 

379.80 380.88 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

386.97 387.97 B: (( yeah oh )) 

387.43 392.71 A: be like ah it may not be as amusing for me not coming from that same background i wouldn't know 

392.82 393.71 A: you know 

394.05 397.00 A: what someone you know the behavior of someone's aunt rosa 

397.00 398.22 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

398.89 401.75 A: but if you want to talk about an aunt edith i'm sure 

402.29 405.44 A: some of us have a crazy old aunt that we have in the closet 

404.40 409.68 B: oh yeah [laughter] i got a crazy old uncle [laughter] [mn] 

409.20 415.59 A: somewhere [laughter] oh well have you ever had situations at work where people start telling [mn] kind of 

416.02 417.90 A: cringe making jokes 

417.42 422.07 B: well yeah i've had um since i'm new at this position 'cause i got laid off from my other position 

421.98 423.11 A: mhm 

422.38 423.56 B: and um 

423.72 429.17 B: what i've found recently is a lot of people are making jokes about people that don't work here any more 

429.08 434.58 B: so for one i have no frame of context because i don't know these people so i can't laugh i don't know what they're talking about 

429.38 430.14 A: [laughter] 

434.42 448.95 B: and on the other hand it is a little inappropriate to makes jokes about people that can't even defend themselves any more about you know what a terrible worker they were or something like that and it's kind of like am i supposed to laugh i don't know i mean i hope you don't talk about me like this when i leave 

440.64 442.03 A: (( right )) 

442.27 443.01 A: (( right )) 

447.66 453.96 A: well yeah that's just what i always think when people talk you know make jokes like that i'm like oh so what do you talk about when i leave the room 

453.73 455.91 B: totally i mean that's what you have to wonder it's like 

455.93 460.06 B: okay so yeah that's that's a little uncomfortable but 

460.67 461.86 B: (( what are you going to do )) 

462.81 465.24 A: (( ah roll your eyes and kind of tiptoe )) 

465.16 468.07 B: yeah that's kind of what it is i just kind of change the subject 

465.86 469.25 A: (( away [laughter] mm i think i need to get some more coffee yeah )) 

468.45 471.41 B: so anyway where can i get this information 

472.23 475.53 A: yeah i mean 'cause how do you stop people when they start 

475.67 483.43 A: you know if you're in a one on one or a small group situation when they start really crossing the line from amusing to inappropriate 

483.32 491.47 B: totally imagine how ostracized i would be if i stood up and said that's an inappropriate joke please refrain from that conversation you know [laughter] it'd be like 

488.05 489.47 A: well yeah especially 

490.66 492.18 A: (( i am offended [laughter] )) 

491.65 494.11 B: (( what you don't even know her )) 

492.78 494.06 A: well you know because 

494.15 494.89 A: (( you know )) 

495.02 500.84 A: being a woman you're probably you know get subjected to feminist type jokes every now and again 

500.42 501.76 B: mhm 

501.06 512.36 A: and you know it's like y- you it's one of those double edged swords you just can't win 'cause if you you know if you laugh you know you feel like crap 'cause you're like you know you're denigrating women i'm a woman 

512.33 513.50 B: that's true 

512.59 518.63 A: how inappropriate but if you get all huffy and like you know i don't think that's appropriate they're like ah she's a feminazi 

516.93 520.76 B: oh she's got a stick up her butt yeah totally 

519.14 520.74 A: yeah what's wrong with you 

520.75 523.63 A: you know no sense of humor and i'm like no i just think you 

524.17 526.49 B: that is a double edged sword totally 

526.88 529.00 A: suck [mn] i used to have a boss like that 

528.69 530.05 B: (( oh )) 

529.95 532.64 A: so he used to tell all kinds of [mn] 

532.91 535.00 A: revolting sexual jokes and i- 

535.00 548.39 A: it [mn] i [mn] it's weird when you have a person in power over you doing that because you you don't really know what the appropriate response is and you can't really tell him to stop it 'cause he has control over your job 

545.01 546.04 B: no 

547.78 549.51 B: [laughter] 

548.80 554.25 A: and he can make your life and the particular boss i'm thinking about could make your life more unpleasant in different ways 

554.23 556.01 B: in just two seconds yeah 

554.72 558.39 A: if he wasn't telling stupid jokes i'm like okay it's just a stupid joke 

557.85 563.34 B: yeah just let it roll off but on the other hand you're so offended it's like i don't even want to listen to this guy 

563.25 568.69 A: (( i'm like ah you know i used to have a kind of a laundry list of important errands i had to run at that moment )) 

568.88 571.67 A: oh i got to go make some copies 

570.68 573.38 B: (( got to go [laughter] )) 

572.42 576.62 A: what what can i do you know wash the dog oh wait i'm at work i can't do that [laughter] 

575.44 578.71 B: (( i can't [laughter] 'cause i got to cut my hair oh you know i can't do that yeah )) 

579.18 583.57 A: oh it's my turn to clean out the refrigerator the coffee filter or something 

580.83 582.53 B: [laughter] 

582.75 584.00 B: that's a good one 

585.37 586.30 A: (( yeah )) 

586.74 587.62 A: (( so )) 

587.94 589.06 A: what else 

588.67 591.31 B: um let's see what else is not appropriate 

591.68 593.77 B: well i have to wonder about um 

594.95 599.89 B: the ratings for movies now for appropriate humor and inappropriate do you think it's 

599.25 599.95 A: uh-huh
