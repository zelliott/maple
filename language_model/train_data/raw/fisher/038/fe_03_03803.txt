10.82 13.12 B: mhm 

12.35 15.15 A: well what do you look for in comedy 

15.19 22.95 B: a good laugh how do you know what's a good laugh i i particularly i heard the question was about what's in good taste and what's 

21.89 24.01 A: what's in good taste thank you thank you 

23.06 28.69 B: yeah that's also like [mn] like you're asking what you're looking for in comedy what does it mean to 

27.25 28.22 A: true 

28.95 31.95 B: be entertained at someone's expense 

32.20 33.19 A: (( no )) 

32.38 34.50 B: or what yeah go on 

33.56 38.35 A: well no that's that's a very good point because i i don't agree um 

38.48 43.11 A: at anyone's expense you know to be made a buffoon if you will 

42.46 46.89 B: but what if it's self self deprecating like a lot of comedians 

46.90 51.92 B: get by with putting themselves down you know as and that's that's you know so 

49.74 50.65 A: ah 

51.76 59.68 A: no you no i i have to agree with you on that i forgot because here i am being a hypocrite who did i listen to this morning howard stern 

59.62 60.71 B: what's he say 

60.54 64.29 A: well um the little the little bit i heard he was um 

64.60 67.19 A: what was he talking about he was talking about 

67.48 70.86 A: well he's talking complaining about star jones' weight problem 

70.64 83.08 A: but then in the next second then he'll switch over and he'll tell about his life how tough he had it in roosevelt long island um how he wished his father had been someone else that sort of thing 

83.23 84.35 A: um 

85.29 93.16 A: yeah i didn't listen to too much of it today because i had to rush out but um i i have to admit i do like howard stern though there are 

94.16 107.70 A: and i don't mind when as you said he makes himself the butt of the jokes so to speak but there are certain topics which i felt he shouldn't reach out there's one thing i did hear what i didn't want to hear he had that um 

108.44 112.52 A: head of the one of the heads of the k._k._k. on daniel carver 

112.63 122.48 A: and he was trying to get something funny out of him but with the terms that daniel carver used um saying how the blacks and mexicans whenever they go into 

114.91 116.80 B: mhm 

122.55 129.43 A: a neighborhood they ruin it i just it just turned me off at that point and so at that point i left but 

125.86 127.61 B: mhm 

128.86 142.84 B: so that crosses a boundary and that's part of what i i don't know howard stern at all i just know some of the press that describes his intent is to be boundary walker you know to kind of kick you in the shins get your attention kick you in the shins and 

137.02 138.10 A: mhm 

142.00 155.14 A: well he's done that because i've decided um you know like i said there's a lot of stuff i you know i do like about how- what howard stern has on but the other stuff that i don't it's only what maybe five percent i just turn off or you know 

155.69 158.26 A: i'll go into another room whatever but 

156.96 160.26 B: mhm now does does 

160.41 161.68 B: that 

161.90 171.60 B: does your attraction to that program based on humor on comedy or on social comment or just entertainment or 

170.91 175.63 A: just entertainment and and comedy mainly to get my mind off 

172.20 173.14 B: (( uh-huh )) 

175.42 177.05 B: uh-huh sure 

175.64 183.51 A: whatever's going on in my life or or let's say like you said if you have a bad day before and you know at the job and then 

183.49 191.63 A: you know you go into the job the next day it kinda puts me in a good mood so i can just it just eases me up so i can take care of things you know you 

189.24 190.11 B: (( uh-huh )) 

190.34 191.05 B: (( sure )) 

191.50 197.68 B: cool and that's one of the roles of comedy you know is to detr- distract you from 

191.95 192.69 A: (( know )) 

194.09 195.92 A: mhm mhm 

197.75 199.06 B: those uh 

198.90 199.83 A: mhm 

199.26 206.48 B: from your own problems so that's a part of of the put down humor is wow like at least i'm better off than him you know 

206.18 210.75 A: oh yes that's an excellent that's an excellent point because so many times 

211.50 220.42 A: [laughter] i have i hate to admit it have felt sorry for myself but then all i have to do is hear what he has to say and its like whoa it is not as bad as i 

217.78 221.63 B: uh-huh yeah what a relief yeah 

220.50 224.67 A: thought [laughter] i'm being such a pest you know such a cry baby 

222.86 227.90 B: yeah and a part of it is uh kind of a self 

228.00 235.41 B: uh inflation you know it's like [laughter] well if he only would do that or if she would only get that together you know and it's kinda like a 

234.26 236.30 A: oh true 

235.66 243.51 B: a you know that's one thing that i see myself doing is that that i kinda of gloat or you know kind of uh 

238.90 240.01 A: uh-huh 

241.27 241.86 A: (( [mn] )) 

243.84 244.62 B: (( you )) 

244.69 253.51 B: know it just it just kinda put them down but this goes way back to uh you know probably the oldest well there's lots of 

246.84 248.06 A: [laughter] 

253.57 261.47 B: i don't know i i see a little bit of the very old abbott and costello kind of stuff and uh the 

259.79 261.55 A: mhm mhm 

261.60 270.91 B: old uh what do you call it when the the keystone cops kind of pranks the the physical humor you know of of that kind of comedy 

265.97 267.53 A: oh 

271.28 272.46 A: (( interesting mhm )) 

272.18 274.73 B: so um that's the oldest kind of examples but 

275.00 279.28 B: but those are just real limited they don't mean they don't really relate it's kind of like 

279.99 284.76 B: [mn] you know just for history's sake but but uh 

285.29 298.36 B: my house spends some time watching i love lucy as a humor form that's old but it still has that same sense of put down there's always a little bit of deceit involved in 

289.17 290.84 A: oh 

298.49 301.24 B: who's pulling one over on whom 

301.34 305.01 B: and the objective is to 

301.99 303.07 A: (( mhm )) 

305.07 309.53 B: uh get the other before they get you and and uh 

309.05 310.17 A: (( interesting )) 

309.98 313.18 B: yeah so that's that's just a part of what what they like 

313.77 322.81 B: when my kids were little i would not let them watch anything like bart simpson or beavis and butthead and 

315.15 316.19 A: uh-huh 

321.03 323.39 A: oh well that's understandable 

323.60 324.52 B: why 

324.14 336.51 A: well well maybe not so much well bart simpson i i do watch the simpsons and and when we have just passed a rocky conflict to get my mind off things you know i was going back to the cartoons but 

336.58 344.04 A: bart simpson it it didn't bother me that much but when i heard about the beavis and butthead now bear in mind i don't have cable 

344.08 348.74 A: but i'd heard so many things and in in the fact that 

348.78 355.15 A: um teenagers if you will were doing some of those stupid stunts that they recommended 

354.15 357.41 B: uh-huh yeah yeah 

355.17 360.15 A: but and and i guess and i guess i cannot blame beavis and butthead because at the same time 

360.19 362.34 A: the kid's supposed to have 

362.66 373.94 A: a modicum of common sense you know put if you're gonna light if you're gonna light a lighter to the ear well duh of course it's gonna burn your hair your ear you're gonna feel pain you're gonna have to 

362.96 366.76 B: some kind of sense yeah [laughter] somebody to say 

368.45 370.84 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] duh [laughter] uh )) 

374.02 378.34 A: so so may- maybe i'm maybe that's not an argument for me to call 

378.14 387.30 B: yeah but that's exactly what it's about is you know how much do you put up with because there's only so much the market can bear you know i mean there's there's a place where 

387.35 391.04 B: the ridiculous is funny because it's ridiculous 

390.62 391.96 A: true true 

391.16 403.81 B: but then all of a sudden the ridiculous becomes the norm you know and they're saying oh well we'll try it out ourselves and we'll do it you know and so then it becomes uh quite dangerous like you said and 

395.86 396.57 A: [mn] 

403.76 409.30 A: 'cause what you made me think of when you mentioned beavis and butthead this latest thing in the news where that 

409.53 417.21 A: um teenager did that stunt from the series called jackass and i guess he's still alive and he hit the pavement 

413.32 414.81 B: uh-huh sure 

415.38 418.51 B: oh bless him oh bless him yeah 

417.91 418.91 A: (( you know )) 

418.83 420.41 B: yeah yeah yeah 

419.50 423.16 A: and it's and it's like my goodness i though we were rid of that but 

423.32 424.45 B: mhm 

423.45 428.37 A: i i i was obviously wrong because like i said obviously there's that type of comedy and i 

428.56 432.62 A: i guess also peer pressure would you know go into it 

433.60 434.69 A: (( i don't )) 

434.39 436.55 B: and what did what 

436.88 437.76 B: (( what )) 

438.08 447.46 B: what i heard you just say was about we we got over that well yeah certain parts of the of the population got over it or certain uh 

447.73 448.54 A: (( know )) 

447.95 449.80 B: age group over it but look 

448.60 451.09 A: oh in in reference to bart simpson 

451.05 454.52 B: oh yeah or these physical humors like jackass 

454.24 455.34 A: um 

454.88 458.10 B: and and so now 

458.39 466.48 B: there's like a whole new group that needs to get the message or get some kind of uh exposure to 

465.89 467.39 A: i guess 

466.76 472.12 B: to the practical use of this kind of humor or you know what does it mean in context 

472.10 473.10 A: (( oh )) 

474.24 479.80 A: [mn] well the the message i'm getting is that the parents aren't sitting down with their kids 

479.64 480.51 B: (( mhm uh-huh )) 

480.56 482.18 A: enough but then again 

481.61 484.73 B: to sit down together and laugh together 

482.99 484.78 A: yeah right and you know 

485.00 486.74 A: laugh together 

486.75 489.67 A: and may- maybe try to 

490.01 492.12 A: i don't know if you could really 

492.18 499.25 A: ease the prob- the pressures of peer pressure you know trying to belong to that group even though it 

497.79 498.97 B: right 

499.50 502.98 A: means that you'll get hurt or worse 

501.68 502.90 B: (( yeah )) 

503.47 509.73 B: yeah and you know that that a part of that transfer is into the bullying that goes on 

509.09 510.99 A: yeah i guess so 

510.04 512.20 B: where kids really are 

512.86 514.94 B: pushing each other down and 

514.10 515.71 A: yeah 

515.81 524.37 A: yeah i it's it's it's really tough i guess for kids nowadays not that it wasn't tough when we were growing up but i guess there's 

524.40 526.77 A: there's just a heck of a lot more 

526.01 527.39 B: mhm 

527.02 529.26 A: pressure from all ends 

528.73 532.85 B: yeah but oh man there's some great kids you know in spite of it all they're coming through 

531.30 535.09 A: mhm well that's good that's good you're very lucky 

534.50 541.38 B: and uh um you know humor's a part of that comedy you know the the national 

537.44 538.51 A: mhm 

542.14 543.74 B: standards that are 

543.82 549.65 B: are out there helping kids cope you know and coming up with the right way to respond 

547.79 548.49 A: (( sure )) 

549.03 550.81 A: true true 

553.50 556.07 B: [mn] do you ever attend any comedy clubs 

555.70 558.09 A: yeah mhm that i have never done yet

566.24 567.16 A: mhm 

570.10 574.53 B: a stand up comic type of routine i mean i've seen 'em like at talent shows but 

574.38 575.47 A: oh 

574.81 579.63 B: they're they're they're more entertainment for their ineptness than their 

579.25 580.54 A: right 

579.78 582.84 B: really good good quality 

582.24 583.34 A: mhm 

583.36 584.33 A: hm 

584.27 591.77 B: so it's on my on my list at some point see some [mn] some type of vegas show or some type of comedy 

587.53 589.77 A: maybe i should try that too 

591.73 592.78 A: (( mhm )) 

591.86 593.72 B: stand up routine 

593.55 598.71 A: yeah because now that you mention it i thought i saw a commercial yesterday where seinfeld
