0.42 1.55 B: hello 

1.14 2.31 A: hello 

2.02 3.52 B: [lipsmack] hi my name's john 

3.38 4.64 A: i'm mark [sigh] 

4.94 6.30 B: nice to meet you [lipsmack] 

5.88 6.93 A: likewise [sigh] 

7.16 8.30 B: okay 

8.96 11.40 A: so this is my second time around on this [lipsmack] 

10.94 16.79 B: it's my second time around too but you know you can call the number in and you can actually set up a call every day 

16.95 17.95 A: wow 

17.76 19.93 B: so you could make ten dollars a day wow 

19.81 21.59 A: [laughter] 

22.79 28.48 A: so the topic was where's the line between acceptable humor 

28.21 30.87 B: yeah and offensive 

28.96 32.27 A: and where and offensive humor 

31.08 33.12 B: (( [mn] yeah acceptable and offensive )) 

33.27 34.48 A: uh-huh 

36.66 37.52 A: (( [sigh] hm )) 

37.48 39.42 B: (( what do you think )) 

41.52 42.44 A: well 

41.74 43.85 B: there is no line no okay go ahead [sigh] 

43.37 47.57 A: i i guess the first line is where it starts to hurt someone 

47.12 47.93 B: uh-huh 

47.64 54.27 A: but even that is just sort of kind of mushy thing i mean hurt their feelings 

50.83 51.95 B: yeah 

54.88 57.07 A: is that you know is uh 

57.18 67.06 A: some people uh can take a lot of teasing some people don't i hate to be teased my brother and sister love to tease [laughter] but they also love to be teased 

61.63 62.47 B: uh-huh 

63.73 64.91 B: sure 

67.12 71.70 A: and so they [sigh] that line between hurtful and not hurtful 

71.77 72.93 B: yeah 

72.18 76.49 A: seems um seems to be quite personal 

76.54 84.17 A: [sigh] so [mn] and when i try and apply that to that to this just general kind of topic 

84.11 90.88 B: [lipsmack] yeah you want when i hear the question i can see that the teasing and the join line between teasing and non teasing 

84.40 85.70 A: where it were 

90.86 104.39 B: but um [lipsmack] i find myself thinking more about about this qu- the you know the word offensive you know bad taste versus offensive you know [sigh] um and then i wonder are we talking about like taboo topics 

96.45 97.32 A: mhm 

98.47 100.04 A: mhm 

104.97 107.07 B: you know [mn] i don't know 

108.04 114.26 A: [lipsmack] [sigh] orientation issues that's always one i mean that's ones like [sigh] it's it's 

110.11 111.11 B: yeah that 

114.93 116.55 A: yeah that's a 

117.22 118.87 A: that's an interesting 

119.64 122.67 A: [lipsmack] int- it's it's an interesting area 

120.57 129.29 B: [mn] [lipsmack] it's like for instance you know i i teach school sometimes [sigh] and uh one of the discussions is always the fact that that that black people 

129.42 130.91 B: can use the word nigger 

130.55 132.25 A: (( mm mhm )) 

131.02 140.60 B: but white people can't you know and arguably it's not over the line offensive when black people use it but it is over the line offensive when white people do 

140.46 142.23 A: that's interesting yeah 

141.63 142.96 B: and then 

142.98 146.06 B: you could kind of say well it has to do with power 

146.15 161.05 B: because like the person who's in a dominant you know from a dominant position like white people are dominant in this society they they in some ways their their use of that word suddenly becomes more offensive than it is from someone who's in the other position 

151.51 153.35 A: mhm mhm 

160.76 162.13 A: mhm 

161.33 163.87 B: or from inside the group and outside the group uh 

163.98 170.98 A: mhm you could probably apply that that idea [sigh] to any of the other scenarios 

164.49 165.40 B: (( i don't know )) 

170.38 172.32 B: yeah like like like like the 

171.09 174.47 A: it just seems like you know if it's a gender issue 

174.73 176.74 A: [sigh] or if it's a 

177.36 181.08 B: like like l- like like for instance do you have you ever do you ever watch will and grace 

181.33 183.52 A: uh occasionally yeah 

182.53 188.41 B: you know and and so what they can have is they can have [sigh] gay and gay friendly characters 

188.68 191.14 B: you know kind of making jokes 

188.85 190.26 A: yeah 

191.30 195.55 B: [sigh] and and it and it seems it just doesn't seem particularly offensive at all 

195.66 202.85 A: [sigh] it doesn't it uh well i mean i'm not being gay i i don't know how it would be if i was 

201.52 203.72 B: yeah i guess don't really know either 

203.42 214.79 A: [sigh] but potentially i mean there's the [mn] and the my gay friends they can laugh about it it's a very interesting thing they can tease each other quite a bit but it's because they are 

215.44 218.76 A: they they understand that it is just teasing 

219.73 223.98 B: [sigh] now what about what about when when bill marr the guy from politically incorrect 

223.44 224.74 A: (( [sigh] mhm )) 

224.04 229.55 B: what about when he said that thing after nine one one do you remember that and he got fired for it 

229.03 230.54 A: yeah that's right 

229.79 234.92 B: you remember he said that that that suicide bombers aren't cowardly 

235.02 239.84 B: you know on the other hand people who sit in planes and drop bombs from a mile away are cowardly 

239.98 243.53 A: yeah which is totally true in in 

240.90 241.82 B: so n- 

242.51 256.04 B: yeah which is th- that would that would would that would that fall into do you think that would fall into that that i mean certainly [mn] lot you know i mean most people in america at the time you know like days after the bombing [sigh] found to be over the line 

256.38 259.58 B: you know and hence his career pretty much ended 

260.38 264.83 B: so but it's a is that the type of or is is that i guess that's offensive huh [sigh] 

265.48 267.72 A: [lipsmack] [sigh] i think that that's 

268.09 282.02 A: i i don't think that to me i feel that that feels like more [sigh] political that's a political comment that [sigh] um that where the truth is too close to home i don't i don't see it as uh 

279.69 280.57 B: (( mhm )) 

282.03 286.38 A: bad taste it [sigh] yeah it could be a bad taste 

287.53 288.55 B: yeah 

287.70 290.72 A: issue but [mn] it doesn't it's 

292.29 294.06 A: [lipsmack] it doesn't 

297.24 298.92 A: (( [sigh] it )) 

299.86 308.49 A: if it seems like it's a little bit outside of this topic if i recall the topic being more on the side of wit and when does humor go too far 

307.15 310.01 B: oh the when does humor yeah and that was humor 

308.88 309.86 A: when does 

309.95 310.93 A: yeah 

310.22 313.87 B: right that when it was yeah well i mean basically he phrased that as a joke 

313.61 314.58 A: mhm 

313.90 317.75 B: (( you know it was his sort of kind of provocative humor that he does )) 

317.09 318.28 A: yeah 

317.67 329.82 B: yeah but i but i i get i get the sense that's more about i don't remember the question but it was something [laughter] like w- w- w- it's more like when does it go from being just gross to being to being over the line offensive right 

318.41 319.92 A: that's true [lipsmack] 

326.48 327.77 A: yeah 

329.30 330.64 A: yeah 

330.37 333.14 B: i mean is that kind of what you remember the question as being 

332.43 335.44 A: yeah yep yeah 

333.82 334.79 B: so 

335.90 337.41 B: yeah i don't know i mean 

337.93 338.96 B: you know 

339.09 343.59 B: aristotle defines humor as that which is ugly without being painful 

343.84 346.65 B: so actually that comes close to what you were saying earlier 

346.84 352.49 B: where [sigh] you c- as long [mn] it's like when it crosses the line from being ugly 

352.55 354.75 B: to being painful 

354.50 356.48 A: (( hm yeah )) 

355.88 356.77 B: so 

357.51 362.12 B: [laughter] i don't know w- w- w- what have you heard or seen that's been uh w- what do you 

362.15 365.28 B: can you remember experience any humor and saying that's over the line 

367.71 369.99 A: (( [sigh] )) 

369.75 371.90 B: (( well you know the line keeps on getting pushed back )) 

372.17 375.79 A: yeah trying to 

380.74 385.38 B: you know movies like american pie that's weird you know that it's strange that you know 

382.81 383.96 A: [laughter] 

385.90 388.40 B: i mean there is a line that's so strange 

388.62 390.18 A: yeah 

389.20 391.94 B: um that ben wilder 

392.46 399.40 B: which was the original national lampoon movie you know mass markets seen one of thousands of screens did you see that 

396.65 397.86 A: yeah 

398.99 400.92 A: i didn't i didn't 

399.85 403.25 B: no well there there's a scene where [lipsmack] they 

403.98 410.56 B: [lipsmack] basically extract semen from a bulldog and incorporate it into protein shakes that they send to a fraternity house who are their enemies [laughter] 

410.71 412.56 B: you know and um 

412.62 413.72 A: (( [laughter] )) 

413.18 423.92 B: y- and that seems yeah i don't know you know a- an- and yet [mn] the line has has been pushed in a way that's that's evidently no longer over the line 

423.29 424.66 A: (( [laughter] yeah yeah [sigh] )) 

423.94 428.70 B: because it just well you know it felt they were closing down any theatres [sigh] [sigh] so [lipsmack] 

426.79 434.46 A: yep [sigh] yeah well [laughter] so so i- that's a general retreat in morals 

434.02 437.54 B: yeah something like that yeah you know [sigh] um 

436.52 438.78 A: in some way right i mean like 

437.82 441.83 B: yeah back back they would they didn't let hemingway put the word shit in his books 

442.11 447.49 B: you know even though he was using it for serious reasons the publisher was like no way you can't have that word there 

444.16 445.09 A: yeah 

446.59 448.24 A: yeah 

447.66 448.62 B: (( [sigh] so )) 

448.94 452.96 A: [lipsmack] interesting so general retreat in morals [sigh] or 

449.01 449.80 B: (( i don't know )) 

453.57 466.46 A: so that line is a constantly shifting line depending line depending on your context depending on the era that you're in and depending on the power structure 

458.75 460.06 B: yeah 

465.70 471.85 B: yeah who you are where you are you know [sigh] um so so so i mean perf- 

467.92 469.40 A: yeah 

471.96 475.21 B: so it's interesting 'cause on the one hand i guess it's easy to say 

475.26 488.15 B: well of course offensive means offensive to whom and under what circumstances but i won i mean is there a general line like if you say well this is [sigh] it's kind of like that is this patently offensive or is this kind of [sigh] to community standards you know i don't know 

479.01 480.87 A: mhm 

485.82 486.63 A: [lipsmack] 

487.31 490.27 A: and i think that's constantly being shaped 

489.62 490.94 B: yeah 

490.45 492.36 A: you know i mean either 

492.67 503.77 A: [mn] i- i- in the local newspapers all the way to the supreme court are constantly trying to define and decide those those lines 

496.29 497.50 B: yeah 

504.45 507.14 A: that you know the whole 

507.77 513.56 A: [sigh] the whole hustler magazine [mn] saga is another 

509.95 512.16 B: sure yeah 

513.88 525.31 A: is an example that comes to mind of something that [sigh] you know at the time was a huge challenge and today is accepted and a lot is accepted because of that decision 

519.71 520.52 B: uh-huh 

521.45 522.61 B: yeah 

524.97 525.84 B: uh-huh 

527.75 531.87 B: (( yeah so is i don't know i don't know you know i i guess i um i guess it )) 

532.83 534.67 B: i guess it's a matter of 

535.58 543.26 B: i guess it's got to be negotiated from situation to situation you've got to say this is offensive to me and this is why and i don't know 

544.06 545.11 B: (( [lipsmack] you know [sigh] )) 

544.53 546.43 A: yeah 

547.12 550.36 B: and we would if you were to set your own boundaries what would they be 

551.55 552.23 A: (( [lipsmack] [sigh] )) 

552.78 558.62 A: i i think it would depend on context to context that's the thing if i 

558.80 561.55 B: well like like do you work or a student or 

561.15 562.63 A: i work 

562.15 563.01 B: okay 

562.78 565.14 A: so i work in a kind of mm 

565.91 580.60 A: it's a somewhat relaxed environment but still diversity is [mn] is very much you know supported and defended and [sigh] and it sort of tends to be a fairly liberal place 

579.95 580.87 B: uh-huh 

581.82 590.91 B: so so like a boundary that that that would be at your workplace would be if somebody put i don't know what what what would be over the line there like if somebody [sigh] 

590.65 594.65 A: oh any sort of uh gender comment 

594.05 594.94 B: okay 

594.76 597.56 A: or any sort of uh 

595.00 596.00 B: okay 

598.19 599.96 A: racial or sexual orient-
