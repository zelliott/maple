29.38 33.24 A: only think i can think of is if it would insult anyone or hurt anyone's f- 

33.59 36.69 A: feelings i guess that's where i draw the line 

38.17 39.45 B: and uh 

39.83 40.68 A: [laughter] 

40.05 43.60 B: i'm quite the quiet a person for humour and sarcasm

51.74 53.00 A: (( i was going to say um )) 

53.29 54.85 A: and it changes from 

54.97 56.74 A: you know from person to person 

56.98 59.75 A: it's more the other person's feelings than 

58.49 59.53 B: yeah 

60.08 61.22 A: you know i would 

61.50 68.84 A: kind of like i was on email and jokes that i might send to one person i there are friends that i would definitely not send some of those jokes to 

69.14 73.59 B: yeah see i'm pretty bad about that i would generally send it to everybody 

71.69 75.80 A: (( [laughter] oh ))

77.83 79.73 B: (( any words company )) 

80.25 82.28 B: and uh i've just had to 

82.70 84.21 B: not email anything 

83.85 84.52 A: (( i think )) 

84.61 86.51 A: that's the safest way 

84.64 85.80 B: seriously 

85.97 91.88 B: i think i've done it three or four times and twice somebody kind of went that's a little questionable 

91.58 92.56 A: yeah 

92.68 95.97 B: one of them was like a a picture of a baby giving the finger 

95.80 96.55 A: (( oh [laughter] ))

99.35 102.64 A: yeah [laughter] especially when you have teens 

101.25 106.47 B: and they're like that's a little questionable and i went you know what that's it and at work 

103.60 104.46 A: (( yeah )) 

106.51 109.85 B: ((  )) 

109.20 110.93 A: yeah i've got to say like 

110.97 116.28 A: you have to be especially careful at work when you're at home it's more not wanting to lose friends or 

116.29 117.13 A: (( you know )) 

117.01 118.79 B: ((  )) 

119.11 121.26 A: (( and yeah [laughter] so if they ))

133.30 140.01 A: was going to say i don't i don't usually get insulted you know i either enjoy it or i don't but i don't usually tend to get offended about something 

139.69 140.53 B: no 

141.30 142.69 A: no it's not 

141.73 148.41 B: no i don't either i mean you know even if it's like i'm italian and even if it's an italian joke or something like that 

147.96 153.42 A: yeah if you were receive it from somebody who you know didn't mean any you know if you receive it from somebody who you know meant 

154.83 165.49 A: what's the word [laughter] meant to insult you yeah but if somebody meant it to be funny and didn't take it seriously i guess somebody that really thinks that about italians or whatever 

156.52 157.94 B: maybe it's humour 

165.74 170.90 A: then it's questionable but if it's something that you know thinks you're going to think it's funny 

171.11 173.28 A: and doesn't take it seriously 

172.67 179.29 B: even sometimes even if they they mean it it does you know i don't think a lot of attention to it because you know what 

179.52 181.16 B: that's their problem 

179.62 182.03 A: you're easy [laughter] 

181.49 183.77 B: no seriously you know
