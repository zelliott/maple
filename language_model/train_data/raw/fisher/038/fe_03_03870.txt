24.89 31.68 B: gosh when you're in certain situations with uh like maybe new people that you just met 

30.98 32.68 A: or maybe at work

42.72 45.26 B: definitely true um 

47.59 51.09 B: comedy let's see and drawing the line 

51.84 53.15 B: (( um )) 

53.88 60.43 B: i guess do you would you go ahead and tell someone that you felt uncomfortable with what

62.96 66.14 B: said yeah well that's definitely true

69.42 73.10 B: if if i was like the only one that was like 

73.68 82.22 B: especially at work at times i think this happened to me when i if i was at work and i thought something was going in the wrong direction 

81.51 83.38 A: (( mhm )) 

82.57 86.19 B: but i used to work with a lot of 

86.61 97.32 B: guys and that can be a place where things can go in a totally wrong direction and sometimes you just have to walk away because 

87.58 89.24 A: (( oh yeah )) 

98.07 100.46 B: nothing you say is going to change 

100.77 103.13 B: their mind what they're thinking about 

102.36 103.61 A: (( that is so so )) 

103.70 104.58 A: (( true )) 

107.66 110.16 A: (( and the ratio of um )) 

110.13 123.36 A: female to male comedians out there is like there's ten guys talking about sex and what not compared to maybe five females up against that brick wall talking about sex and what not 

117.42 118.30 B: (( [laughter] )) 

122.67 131.29 B: yeah that's true and that's i think that's more acceptable i guess in society especially when you if you look at that ratio as to what 

131.36 133.31 B: sells on t._v. 

133.90 146.10 A: yeah cause i noticed that so far from what i've seen in the past let's say five years there's maybe been five women comedians who've had their own show 

146.34 148.56 B: that's true like and 

147.04 150.15 A: one for every year [laughter] 

149.30 155.21 B: poor margaret show who i used to watch that got cancelled i don't know if you ever saw that one

163.17 168.84 B: it was it was a long time ago it was a long time ago it was like but she had a show that was 

164.94 166.51 A: (( oh )) 

168.85 169.83 B: i guess 

169.90 176.26 B: yeah i i think there was a little bit of controversy some people might have been offended by it just because she took stereotypes 

175.93 177.14 A: mhm 

176.56 183.72 B: of her chinese family and that's what the comedy was about and 

179.31 180.27 A: mhm 

183.91 184.74 A: [noise] 

184.46 187.92 B: you know [noise] stereotype just like people are upset at the 

188.36 190.23 B: family i guess because 

189.48 191.23 A: mhm 

190.32 193.19 B: i think the mob is depicted inappropriately 

192.79 194.53 A: [laughter] 

193.43 197.22 B: kind of kind of the same thing that was going on with the show 

197.70 199.79 A: yeah 

198.97 201.84 B: it didn't take off but it was a very good show 

201.62 202.79 A: (( [noise] )) 

202.68 203.87 B: yeah 

205.13 206.94 B: where to draw the line

211.80 213.35 B: [laughter] 

212.38 218.85 A: is there a line to be drawn at this point in in life [laughter] 

215.01 216.08 B: well 

216.95 222.92 B: i think i think it all depends on what is uh acceptable at the time 

223.12 224.00 B: like 

224.12 235.26 B: we're in the very p._c. time now i'd say we couldn't in certain circles you don't even have to worry about uh about that like at work 

226.96 228.54 A: oh yeah that's 

235.27 238.32 B: people are often unpc there 

237.96 239.12 A: oh yeah 

239.49 248.30 B: but uh i say at church people are very aware of the things they're talking about and more have to try and 

247.90 250.68 A: yeah i've noticed there's not a lot of bum 

251.01 252.85 A: jokes going around 

252.09 255.77 B: yeah they're so so that's true that's true 

254.86 258.49 A: nobody wants to touch that nobody even wants to go there 

258.53 260.75 A: [laughter] 

261.52 266.77 B: i think i should of written down the uh topic so i could think about it more 

266.79 267.92 B: but um 

266.96 269.68 A: where to draw the line in comedy 

268.94 271.09 B: where to draw the line in comedy 

269.85 270.43 A: [noise] 

272.21 273.46 B: mhm 

276.32 278.67 A: my friends says there's no line to be drawn 

279.24 283.27 B: yeah in comedy i think you can get away with a whole lot more because you 

283.36 291.55 B: you you put you're putting a comedic spin on it so it's not really you don't really mean what you're saying 

285.65 287.02 A: [noise] yeah 

288.15 288.86 A: (( cause )) 

289.04 290.76 A: i remember watching

329.71 331.38 A: i am old 

333.50 343.99 A: yeah all of a sudden you know here i am in my mid thirties [noise] and he's the conductor on shining time station 

344.06 346.69 B: yeah i don't know how that happened 

344.87 351.91 A: mean while this was the man in the sixties who were was saying the southern words that you can't say on t._v. 

351.92 353.29 B: right

357.39 367.59 A: [laughter] i blew a gasket i was like oh my god of all people ringo star yeah but but but him [laughter] 

360.15 360.94 B: [laughter] 

365.58 366.87 B: yeah 

371.57 374.34 B: where to draw the line 

377.46 379.18 B: (( in comedy )) 

381.27 391.64 A: you know who's who's good oh gosh i can't think of his name now what's the what's that really straight guy he does those one liners 

385.11 386.40 B: (( who is that )) 

391.67 394.14 A: you know i got to the end of the 

394.26 397.74 A: the dictionary and found out that the zebra did it 

397.38 399.95 B: no i am not aware of that 

399.27 406.24 A: [laughter] i remember on my dog now he's gone [sigh] 

406.81 408.11 B: (( [laughter] i'm )) 

408.44 410.86 B: thinking about his comedy situation 

417.82 419.01 B: yeah i guess it's 

419.13 422.30 B: old time by the rating system in a way 

421.21 423.07 A: mhm 

422.42 426.08 B: they're the ones deciding but it seems like anything goes 

426.95 434.00 A: yeah especially now it's it's it's the twenty first century pretty much all common decency has been stripped away 

434.24 440.57 B: true because there's people like that guy that was married to um drew barrymore for like 

440.10 442.39 A: oh yes tom green 

442.28 447.26 B: yes see he's got really weird stuff that's going on but that's considered comedy 

446.69 447.95 A: he 

448.30 460.71 A: the only reason why i think he's out spoken is because he had a lot to deal with at the time because he was going through cancer and he was having you know various body parts removed yeah 

460.71 463.90 B: that's that's true because of prostate cancer 

464.04 468.15 B: mhm so maybe that was his little if way of dealing with that 

466.86 472.98 A: that's that was probably his way of dealing with it because if you if you look at the past 

474.13 476.33 A: just before she passed away 

476.47 488.69 A: went on um garry show and the first thing that garry asked her was you know i haven't seen you in like years where have you been and goes dead pan oh 

488.83 492.70 A: battling ovarian cancer and the audience went into hysterics 

493.37 496.92 A: cause they knew it was funny and they knew it was true 

493.55 494.92 B: wow 

498.50 499.56 B: (( amazing )) 

499.80 502.42 B: so maybe the conclusion is if you are 

503.54 507.47 B: going pushing the the uh line on comedy 

506.40 508.26 A: pushing the envelope 

507.65 512.61 B: right then maybe you're battling some disease that could kill you 

512.82 516.60 A: yeah partly [laughter] 

516.47 518.97 B: other people don't spend that much time 

518.44 520.16 A: well um 

520.20 526.82 A: every doctor that will ever tell is they say that laughter is the best medicine no matter what 

526.49 528.91 B: that's true that's 

529.01 529.89 B: (( very true )) 

529.93 533.69 B: so we could of made a good conclusion that we have a new thesis 

533.83 534.80 B: going 

535.58 539.96 B: people who are pushing the envelope are about ready to die 

539.93 541.37 A: [laughter] 

540.73 541.68 B: (( something they )) 

541.45 548.98 A: it's it's it's their way of facing the tough issues it's their way of facing life or death or what have you 

541.90 543.11 B: [noise] 

547.42 548.13 B: (( need )) 

550.11 551.97 B: (( to know about wow )) 

553.51 554.64 B: comedy 

555.71 557.41 A: comedy is confusing 

557.60 558.94 A: [laughter] 

562.00 566.55 A: comedy is easy it's life that's hard 

566.07 567.77 B: [noise] 

568.93 573.99 A: anybody can get up there and tell a joke it's the way you say it 

573.45 575.46 B: that's true and delivering 

575.57 577.46 A: it's all about timing 

575.76 576.60 B: yeah 

583.78 588.49 B: i haven't actually ever been to see anybody do comedy live so 

587.80 589.41 A: oh goodness 

589.44 592.36 B: i know i wonder how that would work then 

590.83 591.85 A: i 

591.99 598.37 A: i live like fifteen twenties minutes away from the comedy club here in brooklyn 

598.23 599.53 B: really
