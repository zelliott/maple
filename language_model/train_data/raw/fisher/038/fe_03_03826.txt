0.00 1.20 A: hello 

0.84 2.15 B: (( hello )) 

1.76 3.57 A: hi i'm audrey 

3.27 6.42 B: hi audrey my name is karen nice to meet you 

5.77 6.88 A: you too 

6.70 20.83 B: great um i guess um i wanted to make sure that i i had heard it correctly so it is comedy and what your opinion is about drawing the line and what's ah i guess good humor and bad humor basically okay just to make sure we're on the same page 

17.54 18.66 A: right 

19.81 21.46 A: [laughter] 

20.87 28.26 B: wonderful so um yeah what are you do you have any thoughts that that come up to ah the forefront of your mind when you first heard it or 

27.82 41.39 A: um yeah just um like how sometimes in movies um i think there should be a line drawn like sometimes it's unacceptable like you really don't want to see some of the things you see on the movies it depends like 

41.42 44.25 A: i mean it depends i guess on age groups too 

43.95 53.51 B: sure absolutely um i i totally agree i mean there's some things that are appropriate um and even not even just a child versus an adult type of a situation but 

53.40 57.44 B: even you know um i think a generational thing as well you know i think 

57.32 69.10 B: my parents might be a little more embarrassed to hear some things than i might be you know [laughter] [laughter] and then my grandparents you know and so forth you know because of just um the way that you were raised and the generation you were raised during and 

59.91 61.09 A: right 

61.38 62.70 A: yeah [laughter] 

69.05 74.79 B: and then i think also one place that i draw the line is things that can be um [lipsmack] in bad taste is 

74.65 85.95 B: you know stuff that can just be construed as um being somehow biased um towards any sort of a particular group of people you know something that would be a slur of some sort or you know there's certain things that you just 

81.64 83.01 A: yeah i think that's 

86.23 88.67 B: find accepting [laughter] you know 

87.87 89.66 A: right mhm 

88.76 97.01 B: um and so i don't like to necessarily hear something that i think is really berating to somebody or espe- particularly like a whole group of people and 

96.86 107.00 B: there's certain things that's like i i can be comfortable um [lipsmack] it's funny i think personally i'm the type of person i like like dark comedy there's certain things i don't necessarily think that i'm just like a real 

106.81 112.06 B: prude about stuff but at the same time i um there's a certain thing that just i don't know that 

112.52 118.29 B: it's almost it's too much it's almost like seeing somebody um when they talk about that men can be um 

118.44 129.70 B: like it's it's almost more enticing for a man to see a woman who is like you know [mn] in a bathing suit or something versus seeing someone all the way naked it's like with comedy you don't have to have it all the way always in your face 

124.64 125.68 A: uh-huh 

129.59 140.69 B: it's like leaving a little bit you know [laughter] but i was gonna say so it doesn't have to be so blatant all the time and sometimes even too like with profanity it can get a little overboard and stuff where you're just like oh you know 

129.59 130.42 A: [laughter] 

131.08 132.61 A: [laughter] 

135.25 136.10 A: mhm 

140.58 141.96 A: oh i know 

141.53 152.05 B: or you know different things or whatever can be um i guess just tasteless but um is there anything in particular you've seen recently that you can think of that you disagreed with or 

151.99 163.55 A: um [lipsmack] i'm trying to think i mean a few like a few of the teenager movies that i've seen actually i mean sometimes they just they degrade i know they degrade some of like other groups like 

163.56 171.69 A: i don't know they seem to like sometimes they just degrade either social groups or um [lipsmack] i don't know like ethnic groups sometimes 

171.03 172.05 B: right 

172.40 178.30 A: so i just i mean there really hasn't been a movie that sticks out in my mind but i know like from 

178.40 179.75 A: you know just from 

179.96 182.51 A: thinking about different movies um 

182.18 195.93 B: right i can't think of anything in particular either and if there's a recent you know comedian but i'm sure there's people out there who are more outspoken that you know you typically kind of correlate with these type of things but um a lot of times it's like women can be preyed upon 

192.67 194.04 A: yeah 

196.23 210.85 B: it can be gender even you know or you get the the women jokes and we're probably a little more and i'm probably gonna be defensive being female [laughter] but um but you know how we can kind of just you know guys can kind of get on the and sometimes you know you even know go like i'm 

197.76 199.13 A: oh yeah 

200.87 201.94 A: [laughter] 

203.65 205.01 A: yeah i know 

210.73 217.26 B: in my thirties so i was gonna say i remember the old school stuff like andrew dice clay [laughter] and he used to be 

217.11 229.47 B: i don't know but it's just um it is funny though but i i just i love comedies and i love to read funny things and what's funny is like it is interesting how i do decide to draw the line some things that it could be 

229.73 242.53 B: um it's hard to really describe but i was gonna say it can kind of be equal like it's funny 'cause somebody could tell a joke about somebody um i have a favorite author that i read and it's his ah name is david sudiris and i don't know if you're familiar with him 

240.41 241.39 A: uh-huh 

242.31 243.36 A: no 

242.43 249.56 B: but he writes on he's actually um he's gay and it's funny because he will tell these jokes from his perspective 

249.33 254.92 B: but if somebody else were to who was maybe ah not gay were to stand up and kinda say the same things 

254.68 265.87 B: to me i would probably not have the same reaction but it's kind of okay for him to do it because he's [sigh] poking fun at himself you know versus like you know a a the stereotype of some group of people or something you know 

257.23 258.22 A: right 

265.71 270.65 B: so it's just interesting how it depends on who's saying it as well and how it's presented you know 

270.17 279.36 A: yeah i know 'cause i mean i have a few actually i have a friend who is gay [laughter] and i mean he jokes about things and i mean it's it's funny it's just like 

273.93 274.91 B: mhm 

279.37 289.17 A: i don't think anything of it when he jokes about some of the things he says like but then when i hear other people saying things it just bothers me and it just it shouldn't be done i don't think 

282.97 283.87 B: right 

288.11 296.09 B: right right so you know there's all this different like i guess there's just a lot of different factors and variables to think about and like you talked about like with age and 

292.76 293.73 A: right 

296.04 303.52 B: who's saying it and how it's presented and if you can tell kind of if you know a little of the history about the person too what type of a person are they a good hearted 

303.33 316.53 B: person let's say if it's someone that you know and it's not like a famous comedian and you're just hearing this and someone's saying something [mn] it kind of sometimes you can read into it and you know that they're not meaning it ill intended it's just kind of you can um 

315.71 317.51 A: (( mhm way the person acts you )) 

316.45 329.53 B: yeah you know just the way that they are and that sometimes people might stick their foot in their mouth and they they don't mean it that way or whatever [mn] and then on the reverse sometimes people take things and you have to kind of also think is it your perception of it as well and stuff you know 

328.78 330.27 A: (( know mhm )) 

329.53 341.78 B: um but um it's interesting though i this one's kind of hard to talk about [laughter] 'cause it's like gosh i don't know that there's any specifics it's not a really black and white kind of an issue where it's just so certain you know 

333.68 335.61 A: it is it is really 

340.03 341.31 A: exactly 

341.93 346.00 B: but um [lipsmack] what else can we think of let's see [laughter] 

344.36 345.26 A: (( um )) 

345.14 353.16 A: um well i actually have a friend who like who does joke about offending things and and he's a guy and he's just 

350.35 351.27 B: uh-huh 

352.99 366.06 A: i mean some of the things he says like they really do hurt me and i don't he he just takes it as you know this is how i am and this is funny it's not supposed to be like serious and but some of the things actually i think are serious 

363.02 364.17 B: mhm 

366.47 374.33 A: so i don't know i think he just does it to girls i don't think it's something that he does to his guy friends and if he does it's probably not the same 

374.12 381.94 B: right well that yeah that is tough because you know it is um people feel a little bit more comfortable sometimes when they know someone pretty personally and they can 

382.13 386.62 B: almost to um you know you find that sometimes you can fall prey to 

386.47 391.29 B: and was in a general situation but also specifics sometimes you can share something with a friend 

391.14 395.92 B: and then they can turn it around or whatever and they're joking but they don't realize that something also could be 

395.70 410.13 B: potentially re- really does hurt and even though you know that they're your friend and everything that it's like you don't want to hear it as a in a joking manner you know [laughter] but um yeah that um i think guys can be prone to kind of tease girls like that even when they're just friends and stuff it seems like you know that might be 

402.31 403.64 A: right 

410.04 421.50 B: more common and they don't really do the same thing to their guy friends you know but um [lipsmack] absolutely though but that's interesting so how do you react to that and what do you do do you say anything to him about it or 

412.97 414.67 A: no yeah 

420.52 427.59 A: well i get defensive of course [laughter] i just i sit there and i say you know i don't really like the way you're talking and it's just 

427.59 436.84 A: and i mean i tell him that you know i'm not you're not supposed to treat me like this and it's not really right and if you're my friend you shouldn't be saying these things to me 

437.11 448.02 A: 'cause i do take them offend- i mean they do offend me and i mean i i don't really goof around with him that much just because i'm not really that serious of a person just i think our sense of humors are different 

440.17 441.26 B: (( uh-huh right )) 

448.06 459.49 B: oh yeah and that's very key too i think that's a lot of it as well when you get into a situation where it is something that you're personally experiencing instead of directly with another individual it is it it's hard when you're 

448.28 449.19 A: so 

459.43 472.44 B: from two different worlds as far as like well maybe not completely but as far as your sense of humor your sense of humors go you know and ah that's difficult because what they might just think is just you know so hilariously funny it's like it's like really winding you you know 

465.00 466.01 A: right 

471.53 473.38 A: [laughter] 

472.41 484.55 B: but um yeah so that that's interesting though i i agree though i think i've had i've been in your shoes before in situations like that and i've also probably inadvertently hurt somebody without intending to because i'm 

484.99 493.73 B: just goofy and um i think that i probably sometimes can be prone to joke about stuff and then not realize that it's like gosh 'cause i'm being so silly but it's funny because i 

486.60 487.53 A: [laughter] 

493.58 504.98 B: as a child or whatever i could always [mn] was one of the people who could dish it out but then i couldn't take it so i think i'm i am more like sensitive about that because i feel horrible when i accidentally hurt somebody when i'm telling a joke or something 

498.09 499.26 A: (( oh )) 

504.07 508.57 A: yeah but sometimes you just can't help it it just comes out 

505.11 505.88 B: yeah 

506.26 507.43 B: yeah 

508.13 512.20 B: yeah and it just kind of like you're just saying you know whatever and then i don't know 

512.38 524.00 B: sometimes if you're ever together with friends and you're like oh you're like having a beer or something and then you're like oh goodness what did i say [laughter] but um but anyway so um it is yeah wow 

518.60 521.15 A: [laughter] yeah 

523.79 531.71 B: um [lipsmack] i'm trying to think of what else though but yeah i i don't know i can't think personally of anything that i've really seen or witnessed recently that has um 

531.71 541.00 B: [lipsmack] been very offensive i don't know maybe i haven't seen that much i'm sure there's probably a lot out there [laughter] but um yeah have you participated in a lot of these studies 

536.84 538.60 A: yeah sure 

540.49 547.60 A: um just one actually yesterday it was about um minimum wage and if um i think that it should be increased or not 

547.22 552.69 B: oh okay yes i did the same one so that's interesting very good yeah but um [lipsmack] 

549.18 550.07 A: [laughter] 

552.51 564.20 B: gosh i'm trying to think of what else oh with some of these it's funny it's easier and you just go on and on or whatever and then you get cut off before you know it and then other once it's like you're struggling like what else to say [laughter] oh my goodness 

559.07 560.77 A: i know 

561.90 563.39 A: i know [sigh] 

564.28 569.49 B: um but let's see i'm trying to think of anything else to tell you about that that i can think of 

569.36 574.58 A: yeah does it have to be from movies or can it be from anything 

570.22 572.15 B: yeah [laughter] 

574.90 575.77 A: or like 

575.03 583.89 B: i guess really anything any kind of walk of life i guess you know pretty much anything that you might encounter that that situation would arise that you'd have to make that judgment call you know 

583.55 584.57 A: right 

583.93 587.55 B: um gosh i don't know it just um 

588.09 589.96 B: [lipsmack] yeah i can't 

589.08 596.00 A: i guess it just i guess it just depends on like your values too like how you were grown how how how you were brought up and i mean 

594.97 599.89 B: very true very true and what you experience in your household and your family and stuff what was ingrained in you
