283.96 285.34 B: [laughter] 

284.38 296.95 A: but it was it he has some really funny stuff and they're good stuff to read like around the campfire if you're a camper or anything like that but it's really it's hilarious that's the good kind of humor that i like 

297.16 299.66 B: oh really that sounds like fun 

299.71 302.99 B: um are you republican or democrat before i

343.62 344.69 B: um 

344.62 346.99 A: does he think that 

344.99 355.74 B: i think he's kind of like a renounced democrat [laughter] 'cause he thinks that they're just spineless and they do what republicans do anyways but don't have the balls to admit it [laughter] 

348.61 349.45 A: (( uh-huh )) 

351.15 352.06 A: right 

354.86 360.94 A: right well i mean it each side has their faults i can agree with that it's hard to choose which side to go on because
