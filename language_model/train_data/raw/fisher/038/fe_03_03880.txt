4.46 5.50 A: good how are you 

5.08 6.61 B: (( [sigh] uh not bad [sigh] )) 

7.20 11.96 A: all right um i guess we're just supposed to talk about the topic 

12.27 13.63 B: (( [sigh] uh )) 

14.68 17.20 A: so where where do you draw the line between 

17.31 19.35 A: acceptable humor and um 

20.15 21.64 A: over the line i don't know 

21.69 23.30 A: unacceptable 

22.88 24.29 B: (( um [sigh] )) 

25.69 35.63 B: um [mn] i think um in my opinion i think this there must be something like um you [sigh] you have to respect somebody else's feelings when you actually um [sigh] 

35.64 38.41 B: are making a humorous joke or something 

38.11 43.15 A: yeah i mean [sigh] the thing is i'm pretty i'm i'm very liberal i would um 

43.79 52.55 A: i'm jewish and a lot of people you know there are a lot of jewish jokes out there but i mean i can still laugh at them and find them funny and i don't know i think um 

53.26 58.45 A: a lot of people have issues with race racist jokes and stuff like that but 

58.57 59.97 A: (( i don't know i mean )) 

61.08 74.43 B: see um i think um for me actually when i was talking to my friend and talking to my coworkers [sigh] if i'm making some kind of jokes or something i i will always think something first will this offend somebody or something 

72.08 76.66 A: yeah you have you definitely have to think about who's around you i mean because you you can't 

74.98 76.11 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

76.73 77.72 A: i mean 

78.04 81.66 A: i know i sometimes i tell unacceptable jokes but i mean 

81.69 84.56 A: you just have to know your surroundings know that 

85.20 90.83 A: you're not you're not going to offend somebody else or get yourself in a situation that is hard to get out of 

90.73 92.32 B: uh-huh [sigh] [sigh] 

91.75 95.06 A: and so you have to know your audience before you tell a joke but 

94.59 103.89 B: that's true so basically if i'm not sure basically sometimes if i'm not sure i will never i i would simply not tell the joke actually because um [sigh] 

102.23 103.93 A: yeah ab- absolutely 

103.98 108.35 B: i must be knowing someone pretty good as in [sigh] and then 

107.55 113.81 A: yeah but if it was like a group of friends that you're you've known for a long time and you're very comfortable with i i feel [sigh] 

111.94 114.20 B: yeah yeah 

113.90 124.50 A: i mean just as like you can discuss anything with a friend a good friend [sigh] you can and tell a joke and i mean [mn] they might be offended but if they're you're close friend you'll be able to 

124.35 129.19 A: explain to them they know you're not trying to be offensive or something that you know 

129.45 141.73 B: yeah that's true even even if for some way i kind of like missed their feelings or something or offended them in some way [sigh] i think they be honest and and i will be in in a better position to apologize to them or something [sigh] 

142.00 149.51 B: and if you're in talking to someone you don't know familiarly you you're not very familiar with then [sigh] then it can be a disaster [sigh] [sigh] 

147.30 149.45 A: yeah you have to be polite and you can't go 

149.81 154.47 A: no you can't go telling some inappropriate jokes to people you've just met 

151.95 153.57 B: yeah 

154.32 155.41 B: (( yeah that's true )) 

154.54 158.52 A: what about like uh movies what do you think of movie humor that 

158.71 166.19 B: um [sigh] sometimes i i see some some kind of movies where they're making some some kind of comedy as it were movie um 

166.30 170.54 B: where they're making some kind of joke i i i don't see something as funny actually 

170.61 175.88 B: and um but uh it really depends on locations [sigh] 

175.31 179.24 A: like what kind of movie what do you have any in like mind that you can 

176.83 187.97 B: i [sigh] i don't have anything [mn] right in right in right in mind [sigh] something like a movie or maybe a newscaster would be something [sigh] or a company com- 

188.10 188.99 B: (( um )) 

189.23 193.95 B: [sigh] when the anchor was trying to make some comments or something they they just uh 

194.02 197.34 B: get something out from their mouth and then 

197.71 200.11 B: [laughter] to some people they're they're funny but 

200.21 203.26 B: to some to the other people maybe they're offensive or something 

203.06 205.39 A: yeah but like um 

205.64 207.73 A: [lipsmack] i know especially like in movies 

207.79 215.82 A: i don't find humor to be offensive in movies because i know it's a movie and know it's a comedy movie and i know the intentions are [sigh] 

215.61 224.37 A: for humor and not for like they they don't have bad intentions because i mean a lot of movies have racist tones to them um religious 

224.54 233.61 A: you know i mean things like that and you have to understand that it's a movie it's not real and um 

233.83 236.97 A: they're just [noise] trying to have fun you know 

236.72 244.05 B: [sigh] um i think the movie i i think these days they seem to be doing a fairly fairly good job these days actually they're [sigh] 

243.92 252.07 B: they they kind of make sure that they they don't mess up with their at at least the majority of the feelings of the audience 

250.61 254.36 A: because there's a lot of politically stuff like that and they have to be careful of that 

252.03 265.01 B: [sigh] yeah and uh even if there is some kind of controversial stuff over there then [sigh] maybe i already heard of the comments before or [sigh] i already read some reviews about it [sigh] so basically maybe i have some kind of like 

265.05 265.98 B: (( uh )) 

266.07 271.12 B: preparations for that so so it's not such a big deal for the movie [sigh] 

271.14 271.86 A: yeah 

271.25 273.86 B: i think [sigh] and um 

274.15 281.57 B: if you just go to a movie you want to see some comedy or something you're just having fun you're not really [sigh] taking it very seriously i think 

280.76 283.96 A: and you're you're the one who's choosing to go to the movie so it's not like 

283.97 287.36 A: if you choose to go to it you can't be offended by something that i mean 

284.97 286.85 B: [sigh] right 

287.16 294.74 B: if i know that that kind of movie is going to be off- offensive maybe i will never [sigh] i will n- i will never put my money into it actually [laughter] uh-huh 

292.95 301.49 A: exactly because i mean you you're you if something offends you [sigh] you're paying them to offend you so it's kind of a it d- 

299.18 302.30 B: right it doesn't make sense 

301.64 303.44 A: it doesn't make sense to do 

304.13 305.58 A: there um 

306.41 308.26 A: i don't know what else is there uh 

308.52 312.72 A: like magazines or anything like funny magazines i don't know um 

312.32 314.02 B: (( right )) 

314.38 327.25 B: [sigh] [sigh] um and news casts all those kinds of things i mean when the when the reporters they are reviewing something or the when they're [sigh] when they anchor and they're doing something [sigh] sometimes they can they can say something 

327.70 335.47 B: they maybe they didn't realize they say something really bad they just think that they just thought that it that it was a joke 

335.81 339.64 A: i don't know i can't think of any off the top of my head but [sigh] 

336.84 338.77 B: (( [sigh] [laughter] )) 

339.74 350.66 A: i understand what you're talking about and plus i mean a newscaster [sigh] uh they don't tell jokes or most of them have such monotonous voices that [sigh] it's not really 

340.99 342.04 B: mhm 

345.88 347.49 B: yeah that's true 

350.25 359.29 B: [sigh] it's very easy for them it's very easy for them to make some mistakes or make some kind of like wrong comments [sigh] or something 

350.97 352.72 A: funny coming from them 

358.85 362.53 A: yeah because there's such a fine line between especially like [mn] 

362.79 370.18 A: like like watching c._n._n. i mean like with the war and stuff they could offend someone who might be from iraq i mean [mn] 

370.23 376.51 A: during watching the war coverage and i mean you just go to be careful you got to be [sigh] sensitive to people's feelings 

375.83 378.04 B: that's true but [sigh] 

378.04 382.29 B: i'm also liberal actually [sigh] um i think in my opinion 

381.14 382.65 A: but you're you're what 

382.16 395.20 B: i i'm also liberal i mean i'm i'm very liberal opinion so basically i'm thinking when i was watching the news actually i i i don't think i think these days [sigh] it has become a more and more i mean [sigh] i mean 

383.42 384.42 A: (( oh oh )) 

385.05 386.20 A: (( right )) 

395.30 401.95 B: there are just um that don't really care about the other people's feeling they just uh talk out loud 

400.65 404.39 A: wel there there are certain news news stations that uh have [mn] 

404.76 410.88 A: you know i mean are more liberal more [sigh] yeah mean and there's there's a lot of different news stations and i mean 

407.08 408.58 B: yeah 

412.32 413.88 A: i don't know i mean [lipsmack] 

414.77 415.68 A: [laughter] 

415.79 419.48 A: it's just it's just hard to please everybody 

418.99 427.28 B: [mn] that's true that's true [sigh] but particularly when you are reporting the news you've got to be very accountable i think in that in that in that case 

419.91 421.23 A: without i mean 

425.65 436.64 A: yeah because especially you you have such a large audience and it's intended for informational purposes and they're not [sigh] they're not people most of the people watching aren't wanting to 

437.02 442.98 A: hear a joke when they're watching the news they want to be informed about the world and 

443.21 444.22 B: that's true 

443.24 450.26 A: things can just go over the line you know v- very easily and something that's so sensitive in so many people 

450.01 451.95 B: mhm 

451.47 459.35 A: and they i don't know i think one thing one thing i know that kind of offends me is um nine eleven jokes 

459.77 461.33 A: jokes about that kind of stuff 

460.54 461.92 B: [laughter] uh-huh uh-huh 

461.57 462.72 A: because i mean 

463.80 465.74 A: it there's a difference between 

466.76 467.86 A: something like th- 

468.62 479.75 A: just a regular joke and something that has to do with so many people losing like that you know a loss of life is not something to be joked about [sigh] and 

480.02 489.79 A: such an enormous loss of life like that is just like [mn] a sensitive thing that i i don't think should be made fun on [mn] 

490.13 491.38 B: [lipsmack] i agree with you 

491.53 501.46 B: yeah i think i don't think that kind of tragedy can [sigh] can be the topic of a joke or something or anything humo- [sigh] humo- humongous or something like that i don't think so 

501.09 515.65 A: also like i mean being jewish i mean i know people make fun of jewish people for being like like stingy with their money and that doesn't that doesn't offend me but things like they make fun of the holocaust that's that's offensive and that it's not something to be joked about 

515.51 520.47 A: loss of life definitely crosses the line when you're joking about things like that 

518.99 521.32 B: yeah that's correct 

520.90 529.92 A: but i mean there's like sexual jokes and things like that that that doesn't bother me i think that's [mn] with an appropriate audience that's perfectly fine 

530.75 532.06 B: mhm 

532.14 545.70 B: [sigh] so basically i think the bottom line is actually the jokes somebody's jokes you're someone a group of people might be kind of like a a very very bad [sigh] poison thing choose the other group of people [sigh] i think that's 

544.06 544.84 A: uh-huh 

545.94 551.28 A: you you have to if you're going to tell a joke you have to know who you're telling it to before you tell it 

550.95 552.19 B: (( yeah that's true )) 

552.22 552.78 B: (( [sigh] )) 

552.25 554.81 A: just people people can be offended i know 

554.87 556.33 A: [mn] a lot of people 

556.16 558.25 A: aren't so open as 

558.07 572.89 A: you seem and i am and are offended much easier so i mean [sigh] you just have to kn- know who you're with and you don't want to you don't want to offend people or hurt their feelings or [sigh] make their um make them uncomfortable [sigh] 

565.85 567.47 B: mhm 

572.92 576.45 A: in a situation that's supposed to be like you know 

576.24 583.02 B: mhm something very very i mean something very [sigh] i mean a tragedy or something like 

582.39 590.44 A: yeah it's it's i don't know y- uh you said that your workplace i am still in school so i'm a student and it's it's a lot different at 

586.55 588.19 B: (( that uh-huh )) 

589.83 591.23 B: (( yeah )) 

590.49 596.29 A: at school than at the workplace i can assume i mean d- are people easier 

596.78 599.95 B: [sigh] actually i i i think in the work actually 

597.36 598.93 A: easily offended
