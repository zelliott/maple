144.04 158.22 A: some of those shows ah you know that are usually on the public br- broadcasting station they're reruns you know every once in a while there's something very funny but it it's more the a- [mn] actions as opposed to the words they're speaking you know 

145.01 146.08 B: mhm 

150.14 151.03 B: mhm 

158.09 159.59 A: and i don't know if ah 

159.85 163.21 A: we're discussing both or whatever um

188.16 193.08 B: on stage um on the radio and even in a movie or show 

189.80 190.62 A: yeah 

193.21 194.93 A: yeah that's right 

193.67 195.80 B: you know even like when he's playing a part 

195.63 205.00 A: uh-huh well you know uh the i don't get no respect was was funny every time all the time it's still funny if he times it right you know 

200.21 201.04 B: yeah 

204.76 205.86 B: yeah 

205.14 211.31 A: um and and uh i'm trying to think of some others 'cause you you've mentioned so many right off the bat that you know it's 

211.47 214.14 A: hard for me to even remember um 

213.06 222.49 B: [laughter] oh but bill cosby he can be funny on stage and when he had his own show going with the you know the cosby family back in what the eighties and early nineties 

221.31 223.39 A: yeah mhm sure 

222.68 227.03 B: i mean that was funny and and you know what there was never any profanity 

227.42 228.60 A: that's right 

227.76 231.87 B: or you know anything like that and i mean it was a lot of fun to watch 

232.29 245.92 A: yeah and and it really was funny and you know um what i don't understand is uh most of us are just you know pining away to get back to those days where we don't have to worry if we listen to something 

245.56 246.74 B: (( yeah )) 

246.13 248.07 A: that it's going to offend someone 

247.76 248.83 B: yeah 

248.26 256.39 A: um and ah i i you know wouldn't it be nice to get back to the days of ah lucille ball and and when bill cosby didn't uh 

256.94 261.77 A: you know pepper it with bad language and you know i i just ah 

259.48 260.58 B: yeah 

261.80 263.04 A: for one thing 

263.19 265.63 A: i think it takes a lot more intelligence 

265.67 279.17 A: to say something not using a dirty word than using a dirty word takes a lot more creativity you know um you know s- another set of comedians that is kind of old but the smothers brothers they were singers but they were funny 

270.82 271.76 B: (( yeah )) 

277.32 278.23 B: yeah 

278.81 279.67 B: yes 

279.26 282.78 A: and ah they never had to indulge in any um 

282.84 284.95 A: profanity or swearing or 

285.01 290.12 A: you know it's ah it was just timing how they looked at each other remarks you know 

290.27 293.67 A: you know mom always liked you best somehow it always 

292.35 293.19 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

293.98 294.78 A: (( you know i- )) 

294.79 298.11 A: i- it just always drew a laugh um 

298.63 301.42 A: i'm trying to think of some other comedians have you thought of any 

302.33 304.34 A: any more that you like 

304.18 313.23 B: i'm trying to think bill cosby ro- ra- rodney dangerfield ah robin williams is good oh jeff foxworthy with his redneck stuff 

309.19 310.49 A: oh yeah 

313.46 315.12 B: he doesn't swear either 

313.81 314.75 A: (( yeah )) 

315.22 321.65 B: and everything is you know you might be a redneck [laughter] and then he tells a story about his family 

315.40 316.26 A: yeah 

318.75 319.78 A: yes 

321.50 322.55 A: uh-huh 

321.96 324.93 B: ah like they had the one where they all went away on vacation 

325.48 332.39 B: and his family had never been away and the maid had their cart in the hall and they took all the shower caps and the free bars of soap 

333.11 336.65 B: [laughter] and they were planning on giving them out for christmas presents 

333.39 334.11 A: [laughter] 

336.02 337.58 A: oh my gosh 

336.99 341.70 B: [laughter] it was pretty funny i think all of jeff foxworthy's stuff is i mean it's 

342.24 347.07 B: it's i- it's slapstick humor i mean it's you just can't help but laugh 

344.81 345.79 A: yeah 

347.08 348.15 A: well you know 

347.10 348.75 B: no matter what you do [laughter] 

348.27 353.93 A: when you bill cosby used to bring up family ah humor he had an album ah years ago 

353.88 357.91 A: and he'd talk about how he'd been raised by his mother and father 

357.80 364.02 A: and they'd be sitting in the dining room and the kids would be upstairs probably fighting or wrestling or acting up 

363.83 374.49 A: and the father would see the the light fixture or the chandelier shaking you know the you know in other words the room downstairs where the father and mother were was shaking because the kids were misbehaving upstairs 

373.89 374.94 B: (( [laughter] )) 

374.60 378.76 A: and it was so funny it's always funny and um 

378.93 381.71 A: ah like foxworthy ah you take a 

381.81 384.48 A: a family situation 

384.58 394.90 A: you know and expand that it really is funny because most things that are funny are things that r- happen in real life you know and so they ah 

392.21 393.37 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

394.93 397.89 A: ah but i remember that album and and it it was 

398.09 401.23 A: you know uh it would just crack me up you know 

401.46 402.51 A: but um 

402.52 411.66 A: i was wondering what you think about dennis miller and his french jokes because that is comedy some of it is very political but it was y- hilarious you know 

411.70 417.88 A: raise one hand if you're ah what is it how did it go one raise one hand if you're british raise two if you're french 

417.65 419.07 B: (( [laughter] yeah [laughter] )) 

417.91 420.98 A: [laughter] you know things like that you know um 

421.44 423.46 B: dennis miller's from pittsburgh too

454.76 465.15 A: and some of the stuff he said about the french was was hilarious you know i imagine he was tr- really trying to make a political point but some of it was just plain old funny you know and um 

463.22 464.48 B: yeah 

465.91 475.31 A: and that's ah that's mostly who we've been talking about down here and then we got a talk you know our talk talk radio ah people who are um 

472.71 473.70 B: mhm
