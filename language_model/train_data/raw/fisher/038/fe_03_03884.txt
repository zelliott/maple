0.80 2.38 A: hi this is kim 

2.17 4.32 B: [sigh] hi this is joe 

5.16 7.18 A: do you want to begin or should i 

8.00 10.37 B: um go ahead 

9.49 17.30 A: okay so the question was acceptable comedy um and i forgot the rest of it or where do i draw the line between that 

16.70 23.82 B: right where do you draw the line between acceptable comedy and comedy that's uh you know just uh in bad taste 

23.05 33.78 A: yeah [sigh] um [sigh] well i guess i mostly watch like nick at night programs or old fashioned comedy like mary tyler moore and you know dick van dyck that type of um 

33.21 34.53 B: (( [noise] no [sigh] )) 

33.64 38.81 A: comedy i don't like stupid humor like get smart or [sigh] austin powers 

39.09 53.55 B: well i uh i find that it depends on [sigh] the situation that you're in as to uh what's acceptable humor and what isn't you might [sigh] be with uh some people [sigh] 

53.42 56.86 B: that uh might f- find certain types of humor 

56.67 70.57 B: [sigh] offensive so [sigh] you have to tone down your your kind of the kind of humor that you might be discussing or [sigh] talking about or situations you might find [sigh] uh funny uh whereas uh in 

70.62 81.21 B: [lipsmack] other situations where people you know when you're with people that might be a little more comfortable with you know some off color remarks and stuff like that you might [sigh] you might be a little more l- 

81.08 90.39 B: looser with your humor and stuff like that so [sigh] i i find that it has a lot to do with um with who you're with at the particular time 

89.58 95.13 A: exactly like in a real life situation i guess i was just thinking of it as the programmes that i watch 

93.76 101.33 B: right right well i i i i f- i find that in terms of the kind of humor i i go for and that i think is really funny is 

101.73 105.30 B: you know it some people might find it offensive but it's still 

105.25 115.83 B: worthy of you know being aired on t._v. not being [sigh] you know [sigh] really foul or nasty or anything like that but [sigh] i kind of like mad t._v. or saturday night live where they might take 

108.76 109.78 A: right 

115.68 124.69 B: [sigh] uh some stuff that might be considered off color and stuff like that but without actual cursing happening or but the situations might be a little [sigh] 

124.48 134.67 B: um [mn] i don't know uh j- off color or something like that but i for some reason i you know sophomore humor like that i g- i get a kick out of 

133.66 147.75 A: yeah exactly 'cause um i don't really like stupid humor necessarily like the get smart austin powers type but [sigh] [sigh] my husband had me sit down and watch um dumb and dumber with him one time because he likes that type of humor [sigh] and and i did find myself laughing 

140.04 140.92 B: mhm 

145.28 147.06 B: yeah 

147.74 154.55 A: at certain times throughout the movie so i guess i like the light [sigh] comedy that's more acceptable to me 

154.37 155.58 B: yeah 

156.02 159.01 B: (( mhm )) 

156.05 170.54 A: yeah and nothing cruel like to [sigh] animals or children i like the they used to do stupid pet tricks on the david letterman show a couple of years ago or i guess it was a long time ago and i though that was sometimes funny 

167.75 168.79 B: uh-huh 

170.39 177.30 B: [lipsmack] i uh for some reason it uh just a lot of the stuff that david letterman did i really got a 

177.16 188.11 B: [sigh] a big charge out of i i think that was the reason why i actually [sigh] purchased a v._c._r. in the first place was 'cause i i wanted to watch letterman but i couldn't stay up late so 

184.45 185.75 A: [laughter] 

188.02 197.31 B: [sigh] i i finally agreed you know to t- i talked my wife into buying a v._c._r. just so i could tape that [sigh] and watch it when i came home from work and then she started uh 

193.63 194.48 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

197.13 211.29 B: [sigh] recording her uh her soap operas on it and then it became [lipsmack] you know f- something that we could both use she would record her soap operas and i would watch letterman and that's mainly b- basically what we used it for and 

200.41 201.85 A: oh yeah 

211.06 217.38 B: [sigh] then we started renting [sigh] renting tapes now i'm going back to like nineteen eighty five ninety eighty six 

217.28 218.57 A: yeah 

217.92 220.51 B: when uh you know v._c._r.s were 

220.77 225.23 B: [lipsmack] weren't really all that common yet they were kind of expensive and stuff 

224.20 232.94 A: oh yeah and they usually just had like um i don't know if they just had v._h._s. when they were kind beta was the popular and they were just turning around to v._h._s. so 

231.91 242.35 B: there was still beta out there v._h._s. was was the most popular by ninety eighty five ninety eighty six but [sigh] it still it hadn't caught on to the point where 

234.16 235.24 A: yeah 

242.24 250.86 B: everybody had one just yet like for example we got married in eighty five but we didn't bother [sigh] getting our um wedding 

250.94 264.17 B: taped on you know on v._c._r. because [lipsmack] um you know we we just didn't think about [sigh] that it would be something that we would like to see later so we don't have any tapes of of our wedding we just have uh pictures 

253.10 253.87 A: oh 

254.05 255.37 A: yeah 

263.61 265.96 A: oh does does david let- 

264.76 273.70 B: whereas like nowadays nobody would even dream of you know getting married without having you know somebody there with a camcorder 

272.58 280.18 A: yeah pretty much does david letterman still do the top ten stupid things if he when he picks on a topic [sigh] okay [laughter] 

277.26 282.61 B: he still does the top ten list and once in a while he still does the the stupid pet tricks too 

282.37 290.96 A: okay [laughter] 'cause i i just don't get a chance to watch it much we have two kids and we're we try and go to bed after they're in bed or get to bed at a decent time 

288.88 298.40 B: yeah yeah i don't i don't watch it uh much anymore either i don't even bother taping it anymore we're just you know 'cause i i don't even have time to to watch stuff that i would tape 

294.00 295.21 A: (( yeah oh )) 

298.42 307.53 B: [sigh] so i got out of the habit of doing that but [sigh] like the last one that i saw was like one of his best of shows that that airs like nine thirty at night or something like that [sigh] 

307.56 316.58 B: uh my favorite one was uh this guy taught his dog to go to the fr- to the fridge and get him a can of beer and bring it over to him 

316.60 327.83 B: and he could actually open the the the door to the refrigerator you know get the can of beer walk over to him with it and [sigh] he would drink it and then give him the empty can and then the dog would go throw it away 

327.89 330.52 A: okay [laughter] oh [laughter] huh have you ever gone to comedy clubs 

328.48 329.27 B: and it [sigh] 

330.78 333.74 A: like live performances with comedians 

332.43 347.05 B: we uh we have a couple of times but not for a long time we we got some we won some tickets from a radio station [sigh] to um go see a a comedy show in philly philadelphia [lipsmack] and we went and uh 

346.98 351.17 B: [sigh] that was when the most popular s- s- station in uh 

351.63 354.74 B: in philly at the time was uh w. n. m. r. 

355.21 357.08 B: [lipsmack] and uh we uh

378.81 383.37 B: their brand of humor they're just very l- loose and they play with the audience and [sigh] 

383.39 388.66 B: so it's just really funny this the perspective and the stuff they come up with

435.95 450.46 B: [mn] he reaches [mn] he he uses his comedy based on his real life uh his real life experiences he had a tough time growing up in his family and stuff like that and [sigh] he kind of based a situation comedy on it and it's on right now it's it's pretty good 

449.67 450.46 A: hm 

451.57 459.76 A: i haven't heard of him i kind of like uh did roseanne kind of base some of her comedy on her life yeah

465.35 467.42 A: oh i love seinfeld [laughter] 

465.64 478.36 B: but oh i just really really liked that show it was so off beat it didn't really seem to have uh [sigh] a real topic it was just kinda just really weird situations 

474.37 475.30 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

475.66 481.58 A: a show about nothing yeah [laughter] [laughter] yeah it was just a a show about nothing it was just funny 

480.90 484.29 B: [sigh] a show about nothing just a bunch of silliness 

483.78 484.95 A: (( yeah )) 

484.99 492.58 A: yeah that was one of the shows that we watch and we occasionally [sigh] um watch that if we don't have anything that we've taped on nick at night 

492.71 493.54 A: so 

493.29 499.91 B: i can even uh like i've seen some of these so many times i can tell what this one is like [sigh] just 'cause the opening scene 

499.84 505.20 B: [sigh] the three of 'em [sigh] are in in his apartment and she she just pulled a 

505.19 515.14 B: the girl elaine just pulled a thing of muffins out of the microwave so i know this one is going to have that bit about [sigh] you know her favorite part of the muffin is the top of muffin and the bottom's just the stump 

513.62 515.17 A: [laughter] oh yeah [laughter] 

515.08 528.46 B: and she you know they didn't know what to [mn] do with all the stumps so they tried giving them to the homeless shelter and they [sigh] they thought they took offense at that 'cause they were dumping the the mu- you know the stumps on 'em and stuff like that and it's just so much silliness 

526.21 527.62 A: right right 

528.52 532.35 A: have you watched her new comedy that just came out 

532.39 533.99 B: w- what one 

533.38 541.16 A: there's a new show um e- the lady that plays that plays elaine i can't think of her name she has a new show out [sigh] i haven't watched it yet 

537.44 540.33 B: [sigh] oh yeah [lipsmack] yeah i 

540.47 552.89 B: [lipsmack] it was it came out and i think they suspended it 'cause it wasn't doing too well and uh then i think they're go- they're bringing it back they've reworked it a little bit [sigh] i tried hard to like that show 

544.89 545.81 A: right 

546.31 547.61 A: (( that was that )) 

549.50 550.63 A: yeah 

552.76 558.41 B: i was really trying but [sigh] it was almost as if she was trying too hard to be 

557.57 558.56 A: yeah 

558.42 571.52 B: to be funny and trying to um bring that spark [sigh] back that that show had and [sigh] it's it's almost like [sigh] it's trying to catch it's like trying to catch lightning in a bottle 

558.63 559.34 A: (( yep )) 

571.51 573.63 B: [sigh] 'cause it it was 

573.75 582.22 B: [lipsmack] appropriate for for the time that it was in [lipsmack] and that time has kinda passed and and y- you try and revive it and it just [sigh] 

582.46 590.66 B: i don't know it's like trying to retell a joke once you've told it and you try you try and tell it again to the same person it's not going to be quite as funny 

589.47 596.90 A: exactly and i think didn't kramer try and have his own show just like a year or so after seinfeld yeah and that one fell too 

593.99 597.45 B: yes he did yeah and that tanked as well 

597.04 599.89 A: yep yeah i think they just all needed to be together
