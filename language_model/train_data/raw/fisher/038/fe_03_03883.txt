279.89 294.50 A: right you know yeah they point him out about the way he looks whether he's g- he looks gay or whate- [sigh] and y- and i it it it's better that they just make a joke joke about something you know and and not single people out in a crowd 

294.25 299.04 B: [sigh] that that's it generalization is always usually a 

295.80 296.79 A: yeah

334.06 335.15 B: yeah 

337.61 340.59 B: but he does it he does it in a tasteful way 

340.19 341.61 A: yes you 

340.60 342.75 B: same as uh jim carrey 

342.56 346.87 A: yeah and george collins and uh uh yeah mhm so the 

344.25 345.26 B: yeah 

345.77 353.57 B: yeah oh geor- george collins can get a little raunchy but the way he does it is just is [mn] it i don't know it i find it's acceptable [laughter] 

348.23 349.00 A: [laughter] 

352.55 355.09 A: yeah as long as you don't have kids in the room 

355.13 356.91 A: you know watching it 

355.32 355.88 B: (( [mn] )) 

356.13 357.43 B: yeah 

356.83 360.73 A: i pretty much can tolerate any kind of comedy as long as you know 

360.59 374.59 A: it it doesn't get with too many m. f. words and you know when it gets to where it's just profanity throughout you know i'm turned off i like to laugh but not if they have to use uh the f. word every two minutes you know every minute 

364.02 366.34 B: yeah well if it 

373.61 384.86 B: yeah and and it's the i think the part that really gets me is when it's used out of context like it doesn't fit into the whole thing it just doesn't doesn't fit in in in the picture 

379.04 380.09 A: right 

381.36 382.71 A: right right 

384.54 385.56 A: yeah

386.74 388.11 A: yeah 

387.65 393.97 B: you know like i said it [mn] my major thing is when when jokes are are put at people's expense 

393.30 394.58 A: that's true 

394.20 396.20 B: you know um 

397.49 409.81 B: [lipsmack] it it it's [sigh] very hard uh it's like you you made a good e- example of it you know like when the [sigh] comedian picks out a person in the audience and just [sigh] just belittles them to no end that that's 

399.47 400.54 A: mhm 

407.70 409.00 A: oh yeah 

409.04 415.57 A: and you know who's good at doing that uh i mean you know who does that a lot what's that guy who says he never gets respect 

415.40 418.50 B: oh uh rodney dangerfield 

417.90 422.00 A: he always does that he always tears people apart in the audience 

419.64 420.36 B: uh 

421.70 423.20 B: oh yeah 

422.60 428.55 A: you know and and but i say poor person who's sitting there you know and they're the target of his insults you know 

428.34 429.66 B: yeah 

429.09 434.96 A: yeah because uh it makes me want to go and sit in a back seat [laughter] back row [laughter] 

432.85 433.71 B: [laughter] 

433.94 438.12 B: that's it that is it it makes you want to say well i am i'm sorry i'm here you know 

436.32 439.18 A: right in the back row [laughter] 

438.39 442.63 B: (( this is exactly exactly [sigh] but you can have a ))

506.11 507.64 A: i know yeah 

508.62 512.47 A: sometimes they they just i i i guess they want to fill up the 

512.16 513.52 B: the space 

512.93 518.96 A: yeah but um they need to because sometimes you can go with children and not even know 

519.12 528.75 A: what the comedian is gonna is all about and suddenly you got you're covering your your children's ears and and and their mouth i mean th- i mean their ears and their eyes 

528.18 529.53 B: yeah 

528.93 534.60 A: you know it's terrible they should rate comedies before you even go to see 'em you know 

530.47 531.95 B: yeah yeah 

534.06 536.53 B: that that's it exactly it should be 

535.12 537.32 A: yeah they should give 'em a rating and then 

536.91 540.46 B: yeah they should pass through a what do they call it screening 

539.88 543.81 A: yeah like the yeah that'd be the safest way 

540.51 542.66 B: and then and then rate it like you say 

543.38 544.91 B: (( yeah you know )) 

545.21 556.06 B: this is not acceptable for animals or beasts [laughter] [laughter] see i'm a pretty good comedian [laughter] oh yeah well [sigh] 

547.52 550.69 A: [laughter] 

552.71 556.80 A: (( yeah you're you want to be a comedian [laughter] )) 

556.03 565.63 B: being being a like i say uh being in living in a a harsh climate sometimes is the only way to get through is is to have a sense of humor
