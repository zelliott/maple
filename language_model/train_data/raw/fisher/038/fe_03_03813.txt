30.71 34.79 B: i don't know i see i have a pretty dry sense of humor so like i can kinda 

35.59 44.30 B: take a pretty good amount [laughter] pretty good amount of stuff it wh- when it starts to hurt somebody when you can you know when you sometimes have that 

35.69 36.96 A: mhm 

37.57 39.03 A: yeah 

43.04 44.46 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

44.49 47.36 A: yeah i think i think it also kind of depends on 

47.45 56.54 A: what kind of company you're in because with some people you know you know you can talk about certain things and it's and you know it's not meant to hurt but then some people you know you can't because 

49.04 51.18 B: yeah that's true 

56.25 57.21 B: right 

56.60 63.05 A: you know some people are more sensitive or they have different tastes and things like that yeah

89.13 90.78 A: yeah yeah 

91.12 98.05 A: yeah that was kinda actually on the border line i mean some of it was funny but some of it was like what are you guys doing [laughter]

129.02 130.60 A: yeah like that stuff 

130.91 142.65 A: like you know like american pie and scary movie it seems like they're they're kinda like going for the same type of humor but american pie just makes it and actually is funny and scary movie kinda like goes beyond you're kinda like 

137.33 138.28 B: yeah 

140.90 146.55 B: yeah okay i guess that's the line then [laughter] where it goes oh 

143.29 148.87 A: yeah [laughter] american pie and scary movie [laughter] 

148.08 150.05 B: you what i think american pie 

150.37 156.99 B: well scary movie kinda pulled in stepped on racial stuff and i think people get kinda kooky when it comes to racial 

157.49 159.07 A: yeah i think 

157.78 160.98 B: humor and and i can't remember at the end all that 

161.83 168.12 B: that deep and [laughter] and american pie i don't remember being all that close to the edge you know 

163.89 165.06 A: right 

168.18 169.64 A: right right 

168.89 170.96 B: (( but i don't know in fact )) 

171.02 174.25 B: like you said before it depends on the comedy that you're in 

171.11 171.91 A: (( i know )) 

174.58 177.59 A: yeah i don't know i also found um 

174.62 176.15 B: (( i mean oh )) 

177.87 180.31 A: i find a lot of uh like um what 

180.35 187.11 A: what are they called i forgot the name but the cohen brothers are think are it they they did the something about mary and uh 

183.77 184.75 B: yeah 

185.88 186.99 B: (( that's right )) 

187.35 191.95 A: yeah i could i kinda find that pretty funny too though at the same time i also 

192.26 196.49 A: know like a handful of people who who found uh the 

197.07 208.30 A: joke where where she put the stuff in her hair a little [laughter] distasteful but i found that [laughter] i found that so funny i was dying [laughter] when that 

199.51 200.08 B: (( [mn] )) 

200.89 203.23 B: (( i thought it was funny [laughter] )) 

203.48 207.32 B: (( i just thought it was hysterical [laughter] )) 

207.37 214.94 B: but you know some people just don't like anything so [laughter] i mean like you know they'll the you know they find offense in 

209.69 212.27 A: happened yeah that's true too 

215.70 217.06 A: yeah 

215.84 216.85 B: (( i don't know )) 

217.48 219.11 A: that's true too i think 

217.89 222.07 B: [sigh] you don't wanna say it's prudish but [laughter] i mean you gotta 

220.95 222.51 A: it's what 

222.11 225.37 B: some people it it would be prudish you know to see 

224.63 226.62 A: right that's true 

225.44 228.46 B: to see something like that and they get all huffy but 

228.23 237.65 A: yeah but i agree with what you said before i think you know when it crosses into where it's hurting someone's feelings or or making fun you know doing something that 

229.32 230.45 B: or the other 

234.60 235.30 B: yeah 

235.90 239.15 B: i'm thinking i guess more along the lines of like a comedian 

239.50 241.16 B: or something 'cause we watch 

239.59 240.98 A: right 

241.18 244.86 B: this is a i don't know if you get the comedy channel out wherever you are 

244.58 245.88 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

245.28 252.54 B: but they wa- i mean we watch it every friday there's some- it they just run constant comedians just different 

251.93 252.88 A: uh-huh 

253.63 257.68 B: half hours of different comedians and some people you know 

254.00 254.65 A: (( [noise] )) 

257.89 259.95 B: i think that's where i notice it more 

260.00 263.39 B: getting closer to the edges than with movies or whatever 

262.85 277.32 A: right i think it's i really like the comedians who kind of um go into intellectual subjects and find humor in that i don't like it when when uh when the comedians are looking for something to be funny and they start picking someone out of the audience 

268.78 269.90 B: yeah 

275.95 278.07 B: (( yeah that yeah they )) 

277.55 283.65 A: and you're like you know you don't have to get you know this person's paying to see you you don't have to get personal with them 

281.72 284.34 B: yeah exactly exactly 

284.20 288.95 A: you know and you don't know what the person's sensibility is in the audience 

287.52 288.76 B: (( that's right )) 

289.11 290.13 A: so 

290.08 294.79 B: you would assume i don't know i went to see george carlin a few weeks ago 

294.87 295.84 A: mhm 

295.27 302.00 B: at up this up the road and he was he was really good and there was a lot [laughter] a lot of stuff in his shows that are 

302.24 305.35 B: i mean with the wrong person [laughter] listening to it could really 

305.61 308.27 A: it could really be of- right right 

305.72 315.07 B: that could be the edge i mean he gets really close to the edge but he's intelligent and he knows you know i don't know i mean he's been around forever 

313.20 315.11 A: yeah i think his whole um 

315.28 325.89 A: his monologue on your shit and my shit or what was you know [laughter] the whole you know when it's my stuff it's it's my stuff but when it's somebody's stuff it's their shit or whatever 

317.60 319.45 B: [laughter] 

321.73 323.54 B: [laughter] 

324.87 327.35 B: [laughter] 

325.93 329.15 A: that's oh he's so [laughter] 

328.04 331.56 B: he is he oh he just cracks me so much 

330.99 333.00 A: yeah he's great at um 

333.32 336.63 A: [noise] what's like like language kind of humor like 

335.55 337.48 B: oh yeah definitely 

337.13 339.50 A: yeah did you ever watch man on the moon 

340.08 341.15 B: n- 

341.65 349.69 A: it was the thing with jim carrey and he did the uh it was the life of um andy kaufman 

341.97 343.54 B: was that about um 

344.79 346.45 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

349.05 352.89 B: yeah yeah i didn't see the movie but i've seen bits and pieces 

352.95 355.99 A: okay well there's there's this um 

356.19 358.82 A: personality that andy kaufman 

358.85 367.07 A: embodies or he like he he puts on this make up and pretends to be this other person like so totally that he won't respond unless you 

363.23 364.07 B: uh-huh 

367.01 370.59 B: oh the the really strait laced guy kinda with a 

367.21 368.58 A: know other people 

370.95 379.22 A: like a really fat kind of guy with a big nose and he puts on like these big sideburns and this really awful kind of ruffled shirt uh vegas 

370.97 372.12 B: (( i think i know yeah )) 

375.14 376.88 B: (( yeah yeah yeah )) 

377.73 379.33 B: yeah i know who you mean 

379.51 392.37 A: yeah and really arrogant and it's you know and uh i was watching the the movie and you know he was they were kind of recreating what he what his comedy act and i put that in quotation 

379.56 383.76 B: yeah and really arrogant [laughter] [laughter] 

392.30 402.49 A: comedy act was and it was just so horrible like he would like verbally abuse people out in the audience and uh you know it 

398.11 399.33 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

400.67 403.55 B: well if the wrong person i'm sorry [laughter] 

402.77 404.54 A: oh no go ahead go ahead it's okay 

403.74 409.48 B: if the wrong person were to walk in on that they would surely take that the wrong way i mean just you know 

407.74 409.93 A: yeah well i mean i think 

410.31 421.31 A: um a lot the people in the audience didn't know what they were seeing like i think andy kaufman's humor was very or his version of comedy or humor was very personal like his 

413.28 414.62 B: yeah 

420.34 421.12 B: (( mhm )) 

421.78 428.28 A: um what he found funny was it it was like personalized to him and his circle of friends and um 

426.47 427.64 B: yeah 

428.63 434.04 A: and every like it was like the rest of the world was like outside of the joke and it wasn't until 

434.44 441.74 A: you know much much later when they're like oh this is stage or this isn't real or this is whatever that you're kinda like oh 

439.37 440.36 B: right 

441.77 443.47 A: but then you're just so 

443.64 448.48 A: you are so caught up in not knowing what was going on that it ceased to be funny anymore 

448.03 451.61 B: right was that remember when they did the wrestling thing 

451.70 455.08 B: was that with the the same guy with the when he did the 

451.96 452.76 A: the 

455.37 457.41 B: the thing with the sideburn guy 

457.49 459.85 B: i remember he did a wrestling thing when he wa- it 

459.78 462.69 A: yeah that's him when he would wrestle women 

460.23 461.39 B: (( was somebody )) 

462.44 465.08 B: okay that was when he was doing that guy 

465.20 467.79 B: that sideburn guy or was that whole different 

465.27 466.26 A: uh yea- 

467.87 469.63 A: um that was 

468.42 471.26 B: i can't remember this is vague i can't remember how 

471.22 479.23 A: yeah he was um he was playing he was being andy kaufman but he was running around going i wanna wrestle woman when he was doing that 

476.71 481.36 B: okay but it was for real though right wasn't or was it [laughter] 

479.77 480.50 A: well 

481.24 494.04 A: well according to the movie he was he was just doing it like as a personal joke to himself like according to the movie it was he was all like he was saying oh woman are weak and i can take on i can beat up any woman blah blah blah 

493.53 494.47 B: uh-huh 

493.90 502.27 A: as a personal joke to himself because he always wanted to be like the bad guy of w._w._f. wrestling and what's the worst bad guy he can come up 

497.59 498.24 B: (( [mn] )) 

502.26 503.47 B: okay 

502.31 510.61 A: but the rest of the world took it completely seriously and thought he actually was being a jerk and a lot of people really hated him for it and were like what's wrong with you 

504.65 505.53 B: [laughter] 

511.15 513.56 A: you know like that kind of humor 

511.62 517.25 B: yeah i'm gonna have to go rent that now and watch it [laughter] watch the whole thing [laughter] 

514.98 516.08 A: (( it's rea- )) 

516.15 528.79 A: yeah it's really biz- you know he's just like a really bizarre person when you when you're watching a movie and you're kinda like okay i get why you're thinking that might be funny but why are you doing that [laughter] 

525.99 527.03 B: (( i remember )) 

527.28 529.03 B: seeing him when he was on

564.63 565.80 A: okay i 

566.84 570.35 A: like the reruns on comedy central and
