0.46 7.53 A: comedy is something that i really enjoy very much um but there is a um 

7.86 16.72 A: a fine line that we draw that um distinguishes comedy in good taste and comedy in bad taste 

16.81 25.29 A: comedy in good taste is something that we have seen over the years in um television production such as i love lucy 

25.24 33.64 A: and ah the bill cosby show all of these are very well documented and um they have been um 

34.06 37.77 A: numerously ah commended upon in 

37.81 46.17 A: um the television and broadcast media as being one of the best of the um the comedy regime 

46.48 58.23 A: um comedy is something that ah is supposed to make people laugh and it should be doing it not so much at the um 

58.32 59.29 A: the 

59.69 64.73 A: ah positioning of making someone feel or look bad 

65.15 76.85 A: and it should also [sigh] um make a person feel good [noise] when they when they are laughing [noise] and the comedy that bill cosby produces 

77.18 87.35 A: and the comedy that um people in the past such as ah lucille ball and ah such comedians in that caliber have produced 

87.42 90.79 A: um fit in to this category very well 

90.72 104.49 A: they they can make people laugh without condemning anybody or putting anybody ah down um and when you actually laugh at that ah production 

104.56 115.22 A: you feel good from the inside out um that is what good comedy is and that is what good comedy in good taste ah is in our opinion 

115.65 120.54 A: however comedy now can also fall into a more 

120.92 130.62 A: disgusting or black area and by black i don't mean racially black i mean black in the sense that it is um 

131.77 144.45 A: less um sunny and less happy type of ah feeling that a person can get from laughing at this type of ah poking jokes at kind of comedy 

144.74 151.15 A: and um this can be done um in in any kind of form 

151.26 159.97 A: anything from making a person look ah stupid or making a race look um demeaning 

159.94 169.91 A: in some way or form in a a national audience or in in any audience um actually not just a national audience um 

168.25 170.26 B: (( [cough] okay )) 

170.30 175.38 B: um let me let me interject for just a second i'm your partner from mississippi 

175.17 176.26 A: okay 

175.81 177.85 B: and you're from 

178.63 179.39 B: what 

178.77 180.95 A: al- albany new york 

180.26 186.90 B: from new york oh i have an uncle who lives there i was really interested in what you were saying about um 

181.23 182.07 A: yeah 

187.34 193.03 B: i kind of relate to the old time comedy the kind of red skeleton sort of jimmy durante the 

193.28 196.02 B: classic comedy routines 

196.40 197.35 B: um 

197.52 201.49 B: and what you said about it makes you feel good when you laugh 

201.25 202.43 A: right 

201.85 207.04 B: i think that's a good definer of comedy that's for a general audience 

207.25 211.26 B: but i think there's an edgier kind of comedy too that um 

211.47 220.13 B: that makes you think and that and that questions some of your values and that sometimes does poke fun at things um 

220.78 228.98 B: but it kind of pokes fun at the person who's laughing too it kind of taps into your prejudices or ideas and you go 

229.01 237.51 B: oh i can't believe i laughed at that that wasn't funny and it makes you it makes you think it makes you kind of sit back and go 

237.65 245.42 B: why did i find that funny and i i enjoy that kind of humor sometimes it just depends [noise] on 

245.97 249.76 B: my definition of whether you've gone too far with it or not 

250.25 252.19 B: do you ever have that feeling of 

252.30 254.59 B: mm this has gone too far 

254.59 261.18 A: um yes i think i have had that feeling in the past where where things can get too far 

261.21 262.38 A: um 

262.36 267.10 A: in in different kinds of comedies i can't exactly specifically say 

266.89 274.08 A: if we were to mention like all in the family as being in ah the category that you're saying at this point 

273.86 282.67 A: i would say that's one of the better shows probably that has poked fun at but yet made your stop and think as to why you're laughing 

282.37 287.35 B: yeah they had a good stopping point they knew just how far to go without 

288.13 300.16 B: [sigh] without carrying it to a level and when you say good taste or when i say good taste i have a little trouble 'cause one person's good taste is is not someone else's 

300.41 307.72 B: but i always felt that that show stopped at a point where it was still in good taste for me 

306.34 311.28 A: right right exactly i feel the same way and um 

312.48 321.58 A: comedy as far as um being demeaning is something that i don't find in good taste something that will either 

321.64 324.36 A: um make women 

324.49 327.12 A: ah look like trash 

327.38 333.88 A: or um treat them like trash and ah i don't find that very amusing 

334.19 337.29 A: um i think women are above 

337.37 339.47 A: that kind of um 

339.86 349.22 A: ah chauvinistic format you know where they try to make women look like um they just use women to to make them 

349.26 350.62 A: (( the ah )) 

350.63 357.56 A: the game of um of fun at times and i i don't appreciate that kind of comedy 

353.60 359.16 B: yeah yeah but then you look at something like georgia and gracie 

359.27 360.70 B: and um 

361.13 364.96 B: she played her little role and the whole time she was playing her dumb role 

365.80 372.75 B: she she always had the upper hand you could say yes she's playing the role of the silly woman 

373.36 378.32 B: but after you watched her work the scene you knew that 

378.54 384.63 B: you know you knew that the jokes were not at your expense they were actually at georgia's expense a lot of the time 

384.43 386.82 A: right right exactly 

385.55 391.63 B: and i think it's that good taste thing again it's it's a whole different thing from um 

392.33 396.83 B: oh like andrew dice clay or something like that that that it's just a spouting of 

397.52 399.31 B: hatred really 

399.15 405.26 A: right exactly it's just another form of hatred in um in calling it something different 

405.77 415.46 A: and it it's something that perpetuates hate in in society and it's not fair to the person that's being demeaned in that fashion 

416.36 419.31 B: i've been surprised at some of the 

419.40 423.07 B: i don't know for want of a better word i call them amateur hours 

423.13 429.47 B: where you've got a a bunch of different comics coming on and it's primarily black 

429.49 435.13 B: and they'll very very often use words that of course are totally unacceptable for us to use 

435.51 447.25 B: and they'll be joking back and forth and tossing those words around and i i kind of have some questions about obviously it's enjoyed by a lot of audiences or it wouldn't be on t._v. 

447.22 457.84 B: but i still kind of have some question about how appropriate that is because it kind of the taboos that we built up about using those words are broken down 

458.24 459.21 B: um 

460.16 472.87 B: and there is the there is the thought of well it's okay if it's amongst your own group but i'm not too sure that it is because it's not okay when we're among our group to do that at all 

473.60 480.15 B: so i don't know i have i have some real taste questions about some things i've seen recently although i have to say they're funny 

480.19 481.23 B: [laughter] 

480.74 481.83 A: [laughter] 

481.65 491.80 B: you know when you and then you say i have to say they're funny but the the joke or the gag portion of the show is generally funny 

491.92 505.05 A: right right but is it is it that it's that group that's actually saying it or is it the writers that are actually demeaning the group and they're just using the actors as ah puppets to 

497.51 498.44 B: yeah 

504.92 507.43 A: their own ends of discrimination 

506.98 513.73 B: no these are are variety shows where the people obviously have crafted their own acts and some of them are kind of amateur 

514.00 514.94 B: um 

515.55 525.48 B: and and there's a lot of um i can't think which channel it's on but there's a lot of that sketch artist kind of thing people who are not necessarily terribly well known and they'll come on and do 

525.54 535.99 B: i don't know four minutes of jokes and then the next person comes on and they seem to run i of course i think part of it is for the shock value they seem to run to that sort of thing 

536.40 540.64 B: and um and my husband of course thinks they're hilarious he thinks it's so funny 

540.74 542.72 B: but i'm not sure that i do 

542.66 550.22 A: right i certainly don't appreciate some of the ah foul language that i've heard on television that they think is very funny 

549.88 552.61 B: yeah that's pretty much um 

550.33 551.33 A: lately 

553.22 556.24 B: i think nation wide as this far as the 

556.32 561.09 B: [sigh] general decline we seem to be going through [laughter] 

560.23 564.10 A: yeah i that's what i felt also is that 

564.12 572.26 A: um i don't know where which audience they're they've gotten whether it's a younger crowd that's finding this funny or 

572.33 573.45 A: um 

574.34 580.75 A: some of the older people that are finding it funny but ah certainly i don't think that i fit into 

580.67 591.15 A: either group one way or another and ah it it's just very degrading and how they find it funny i'm not sure exactly where they're finding their punch lines 

591.20 595.08 A: and ah it it's very um disheartening 

593.88 599.89 B: see a lot of times i g- i get the punch line and i get the point of the joke and it may be a joke about some-
