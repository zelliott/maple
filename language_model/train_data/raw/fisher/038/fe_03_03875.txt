3.36 4.56 A: hi 

5.01 5.98 B: hi this 

5.18 6.73 A: hi this is carol 

6.39 7.96 B: i'm miriam [laughter] 

7.34 8.48 A: hi [laughter] 

8.84 12.27 A: (( ah what was the topic i where do you draw the line )) 

10.51 11.44 B: [laughter] 

12.72 13.89 B: yeah 

12.79 13.88 A: between 

14.56 20.74 A: well i think that's a tough call um i guess in my case a lot of it 

21.10 24.09 A: is the tone with which it's said sometimes 

23.80 29.96 B: yeah exactly like if it di- it it depends on who you're talking to also [laughter] 

29.26 36.59 A: yeah wh- who who you're talking to where you are even it something that i might laugh at if one of my friends said it at a bar 

37.04 39.99 A: said during a meeting could have a completely different 

40.29 42.45 A: tone or quality to it 

42.80 43.79 A: (( um hm )) 

42.85 44.71 B: yeah 

47.93 49.56 B: [noise] um 

49.14 50.71 A: [laughter] 

49.80 53.35 B: [laughter] i guess that's just basically the same 

53.43 55.15 B: thing i know if 

56.08 57.59 B: most of the time it's 

58.42 59.41 B: um 

59.86 62.38 B: i don't know with the practical jokes though 

62.61 66.26 B: i guess it's kinda just depends [laughter] 

65.89 68.54 A: you know actually i have it's a pet peeve of mine 

68.75 71.83 A: although i've been known to do them but personally 

71.12 72.53 B: yeah 

72.08 74.90 A: i i hate when anything of my 

75.32 81.38 A: like my belongings are touched with or messed with like at at april fools recently 

77.42 78.20 B: yes 

81.60 87.70 A: a coworker went and taped all of the the track balls on our mice our computers 

85.96 88.43 B: [laughter] yeah 

87.84 100.70 A: and i almost completely lost it because i i kept trying to restart my computer trying to figure out what was going wrong and i flipped out on him and it was the type of thing that normally i would laugh at something like that but 

90.59 91.74 B: yeah 

101.05 103.19 A: well i guess it some of it is 

103.20 109.64 A: partly where you are like where your mood is too because that day i came in it was a monday morning i had a lot of stuff to do 

105.82 106.88 B: yeah 

109.75 115.80 B: and then your weren't ready for it 'cause i wasn't ready for it either on april fools so [laughter] 

114.20 126.04 A: yeah yeah and yeah and i've just it completely threw off my whole morning and had he done that on like a friday afternoon i came back from lunch and it was like that i probably would have cracked up and said oh you know got me 

125.78 130.95 B: yeah i think a lot of the times i like embrace humor also in 

126.55 127.26 A: but 

131.01 133.06 B: you know and things like that because 

133.64 134.64 B: i don't know 

134.77 136.80 B: i'm just not the type of person that's 

138.63 140.61 B: not like you know 

142.32 143.80 A: you're pretty laid back 

142.37 151.63 B: i mean i don't like somebody that's like always joking like i know there's those types [laughter] of people that they're constantly you know it out of their mouth as a joke but 

149.10 150.16 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

151.66 155.51 B: you know when it comes to like comedy and things like that i mean 

155.98 157.73 B: who doesn't like to laugh 

157.63 161.22 A: oh yeah absolutely [mn] i have a pretty high tolerance for 

158.16 159.06 B: [laughter] 

161.42 171.38 A: [mn] humor that could be questionable sometimes um but like i said i a lot of it i think is the setting and how it's said even if it's clear that somebody 

172.26 175.49 A: you know if somebody makes a joke about me but it's clear that they're 

175.56 180.49 A: laughing with me not at me to use the you know the old phrase 

177.70 179.07 B: yeah 

180.51 185.24 A: like that's a lot different than if it sounds like somebody is 

185.69 192.01 A: making a joke at my expense just to make a joke not not as a way of saying you know 

192.33 197.58 A: hey yeah we know you can be a pain in the arse but you know but but we still love you 

194.21 196.38 B: [laughter] exactly [laughter] 

197.51 198.69 B: yeah 

197.81 200.79 A: it's a it i- it's a hard line 

201.54 204.32 A: it's a hard line to define i think 

205.11 208.96 B: uh 'cause it's a just there's so many other factors involved that 

207.92 210.36 A: yeah there's a lot of variables 

209.73 210.55 B: that 

210.64 217.33 B: could come with that because you're either it depends on your day your mood who you're with 

217.08 219.47 A: mhm yeah absolutely 

219.02 220.50 B: what you're doing 

221.19 222.22 A: ah well 

222.50 230.75 A: okay heres something to think about are there ever like jokes that just completely are never acceptable 

232.27 235.72 A: see i i i i have a couple hot buttons i guess in that area 

234.58 236.85 B: i guess when it has to do with 

238.13 239.08 B: um 

240.77 242.32 A: (( like i'm like the thing that's got )) 

241.26 245.05 B: like culture or race culture or race 

242.48 243.66 A: i'm sorry go ahead 

244.60 246.00 A: (( that's what i was going to say )) 

245.37 246.45 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

246.20 249.32 A: racial jokes [mn] immediately 

249.54 254.41 A: [mn] like get my back up even if i know they're not intended to be 

250.28 251.67 B: yeah 

255.00 267.24 A: derogatory like if other uh if if the person i know who who makes the joke if i know that they re not a racist or they're they don't really think that way it still bothers me 

255.11 256.22 B: right 

267.71 275.33 A: i guess because i know that there are a lot of people who would take it seriously or who would at least partially mean it 

272.57 274.72 B: yeah well in 

275.42 276.53 B: (( yeah 'cause it's )) 

276.55 281.11 B: i'm have a lot of like coworkers and things like that who 

281.40 285.05 B: you know will have those jokes and they mean it [laughter] you know 

284.46 289.43 A: yeah exactly yeah i think we all know somebody like that or probably more than one 

287.22 288.60 B: yeah 

289.10 294.25 B: so i guess i would draw the line there but most of the times i'm just you know i kinda 

295.45 305.70 B: just kinda shrug it off in a way i probably wouldn't be the type of person that would say well hey you know that's not right or anything like that just because of that person is that way [laughter] you know 

304.36 310.14 A: yeah and sometimes you can almost cause more problems than you solve by trying to draw attention to it 

309.85 311.22 B: (( exactly yeah )) 

310.52 313.44 A: i have on occasions said something like 

313.54 320.28 A: uh something to the effect of you know that joke you said at lunch you know i thought was a little over the line i [mn] 

320.34 322.67 A: i probably wouldn't make too big a deal out of it 

322.75 323.93 A: about it 

324.67 325.56 B: yeah 

324.88 332.41 A: but and and most of the time i probably just kind of will shrug it off or just ignore it and pretend you know i didn't hear anything 

332.94 335.86 A: because it it can just get so heated 

336.02 337.77 A: to try and 

337.27 341.31 B: it's kinda like not worth the time to and effort to try and 

341.38 343.17 B: tell them why it was wrong 

342.93 350.21 A: yeah yeah because either they don't get it and they're not going to get it or if it's somebody who doesn't really think that way but just 

343.24 344.34 B: [laughter] 

350.81 359.56 A: said it not really meaning anything like you're just going to make them feel worse probably because they didn't really mean it so i don't know what you really gain that way either 

359.65 360.88 B: yeah [laughter] 

360.34 364.03 A: um i don't i can't think of any other topics that really 

364.66 371.93 A: i always think are off base or or over the line i think even sexist jokes for the most time i can 

368.50 369.52 B: mhm 

371.84 373.70 B: yeah i can deal with that just 

373.13 375.18 A: i can laugh off most of them 

375.29 377.03 A: i i not all 

376.49 377.74 B: yeah 

377.29 379.35 A: but for the most part i think 

380.15 389.44 A: 'cause i think most of them are sort of told in a very wink wink nod nod kind of manner like a a yeah i don't really think this but i'll tell a stupid blonde joke 

389.56 392.85 A: you know what i mean i think that the like those are most of the the jokes that i 

389.80 391.13 B: [laughter] 

393.01 394.75 A: i usually run into 

394.40 395.64 B: yeah 

395.62 396.59 A: um 

396.78 397.60 B: (( hm )) 

398.54 399.34 A: (( hm i )) 

399.78 403.52 A: wonder how much time we've got [laughter] sorry 

401.09 402.81 B: [laughter] 

403.70 404.79 A: uh 

403.84 404.84 B: yeah 

405.73 408.45 A: i just don't know what else to say about that 

405.75 406.41 B: (( i )) 

410.11 416.16 A: i g- it's just it's such a very fuzzy kind of a topic i- it almost would have helped if they gave 

416.33 418.70 B: like what kind yeah 

416.90 421.30 A: an example of something yeah like would something like this be over the line 

422.58 423.43 B: (( hm )) 

422.98 425.77 A: um do you have any other thoughts or 

425.78 427.61 B: no i don't think so 

427.92 430.75 B: i'm trying to think [laughter] but i 

436.61 437.43 A: huh 

437.57 442.77 B: no i think we pretty much covered [laughter] what we could 

440.71 441.82 A: yeah 

442.05 443.35 A: um 

446.08 454.15 A: trying to think what else well what about like foul language in the joke if the joke itself is sort of not offensive but the language 

452.75 453.68 B: (( mm )) 

453.71 455.05 B: i'm not too 

455.08 455.82 B: i 

455.94 460.46 B: don't care really i mean if it's part of the joke it's part of the joke 

459.54 460.47 A: yeah 

460.57 461.51 B: (( you know )) 

461.21 465.01 A: yeah i sort of feel the same way i don't get too hung up on the language stuff 

465.87 466.94 B: um 

468.80 469.59 A: (( mm )) 

472.39 474.73 B: no i think probably the 

475.55 480.84 B: my highest would be a racial joke you know like that would be 

479.21 480.27 A: yeah 

482.53 485.03 B: like my least tolerable [laughter] 

485.08 487.01 A: yeah i would tend to agree 

487.05 488.00 A: um 

488.36 494.98 A: did you hear many jokes about stuff going on with the war or anything like that and did they bother you 

495.24 496.21 B: (( mm )) 

497.82 498.91 B: no 

499.50 504.18 B: not really just b- no i yeah i didn't hear very many 

500.30 501.78 A: you didn't hear many or 

504.78 512.40 A: 'cause i didn't i wouldn't say i ran into many although i had a couple people at work were sending around a lot of 

511.77 513.97 B: forwards and things like that 

513.19 517.34 A: [mn] yeah i mean it [mn] they weren't telling jokes about it so much as 

517.53 527.37 A: yeah sort of emails and graphics and that and it i mo- while ninety nine percent of that stuff didn't bother me i think there were a f- a few things that kinda made light of the fact that 

528.15 534.64 A: you know i mean th- innocent people were dying no matter what you may have thought about the war whether it was right or wrong we 

534.00 535.03 B: right 

534.86 538.90 A: there are people dying which is a bad thing 

538.73 541.68 B: and there's nothing to really laugh about that [laughter] 

540.40 547.03 A: yeah it's real- it's not it uh i found it very hard to find any humor in that i don't know if i would say that i was 

547.52 550.17 A: offended by it per se but 

551.29 554.15 A: yeah like i i didn't understand where that 

554.30 555.67 A: was funny 

555.78 559.82 B: well and just like with september eleventh and things like that there were 

555.81 557.30 A: to make a joke about 

560.24 561.21 A: mhm 

560.79 562.52 B: like some jokes but 

564.29 567.80 B: i don't think i laughed too much [laughter] about that either 

567.48 571.87 A: yeah it it seemed like with september eleventh there weren't as many 

571.55 572.50 B: right 

572.07 577.00 A: v- v- very very few i i think a lot of that was just it was closer to home when it's happening 

577.42 581.85 A: you know five thousand eight thousand miles away however far away iraq is 

582.06 583.43 B: yeah sometimes 

582.29 586.79 A: you know it's like well yeah i can laugh at that because i don't known anybody in iraq so 

587.10 588.12 B: yeah 

587.43 588.72 A: you know whatever 

588.41 589.48 B: right 

589.73 590.88 A: but yeah like y- 

589.79 591.85 B: they kinda have that sense of 

591.97 594.87 B: like if it's not happening to me then 

594.83 597.95 A: sh- yeah then it's funny and i can laugh at it 

595.12 596.93 B: it doesn't matter [laughter] 

598.79 599.96 A: although i mean in
