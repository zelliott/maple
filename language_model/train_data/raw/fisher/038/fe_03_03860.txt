0.00 2.98 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] hi my name is jim morowski 

2.89 4.51 A: (( hi this is alison how )) 

4.52 6.03 B: hi how are you 

5.55 7.46 A: are you [laughter] i'm okay how are you yes 

7.00 11.75 B: good good [sigh] okay [laughter] what do i have to do exactly just talk for ten minutes 

12.08 15.76 A: about um i guess comedy and what's inappropriate and what isn't mhm 

13.79 14.53 B: oh 

15.33 18.00 B: oh okay [cough] okay well 

18.31 25.44 B: [cough] to me comedy is most almost always appropriate as long as it's done in a tasteful [sigh] way uh 

26.28 27.63 B: (( [lipsmack] [sigh] um )) 

27.71 34.59 B: you have to have uh a good subject it's got to relevant it's [mn] doesn't it can be mean but [sigh] 

34.54 48.89 B: the only time i would say that it shouldn't be that mean would be if it's getting too personal especially if it's going after somebody's personal [sigh] ah [mn] problems if they are really 

47.21 48.04 A: right 

49.42 60.51 B: [cough] how shall we say um [lipsmack] if they are getting too intimate in terms of uh [sigh] you know if that person is that they're making fun of is not really in the public limelight 

60.53 61.57 A: mhm 

60.71 75.60 B: uh people who do make fun of people if they are are in the public limelight well they know they're in the limelight and they are basically fair game no matter what [sigh] they do per se [sigh] but if it's someone who's related to them like a family member who's not in the limelight [sigh] 

70.28 71.01 A: right 

75.39 77.72 B: and people start making fun of that person 

77.37 78.35 A: mhm 

77.48 91.43 B: [sigh] i don't think that's very fair because that person really doesn't have a way of defending themselves where the other person who is in the limelight [sigh] has a way of defending themselves they [mn] they usually have usually access to the media and therefore they can rebut it and whatever but the person 

81.90 82.72 A: right 

91.35 97.75 B: [sigh] who's related didn't w- didn't choose that and therefore [sigh] you shouldn't drag them in so 

97.01 97.98 A: (( mm mhm )) 

97.69 110.97 B: when you get something like that that's kind of going over the line but in other subject matters [sigh] you know [sigh] uh it also depends on the audience you're trying uh make fun of or or who you're gearing it up for [sigh] 

110.61 111.54 A: right 

111.00 112.44 B: (( uh [cough] )) 

112.67 114.72 B: uh for for example i mean 

114.63 123.83 B: you have uh you know people who some people like you know risque raunchy humor well that's fine [sigh] if everybody knows that they're in for that type of humor [sigh] 

120.46 121.13 A: mhm 

123.60 130.67 B: if you're going out to see that type of comedy well then you'd better expect it just don't be offended if you're going to a show that's going to be [sigh] 

123.67 124.59 A: mhm 

130.49 144.95 B: you know like george collin or or whatever or robin williams or whatever if you would prefer straight liners [sigh] well then that's who you should be going for but [sigh] if you don't want to be offended well you should you should know before you're going especially [sigh] 

134.58 135.41 A: right 

144.81 147.96 B: in a live venue ususally live venues mean [sigh] 

147.78 155.75 B: it's more energetic more risque and uh therefore when you get to that type to that type of venue [sigh] you know to be ready to be [sigh] 

150.01 150.59 A: (( mhm )) 

155.60 166.21 B: or possibly offended but you know what that's you're [laughter] right to be cho- choosing to get in there [sigh] so when you g- have something like that you definitely want to [sigh] [lipsmack] 

160.29 161.08 A: (( uh-huh )) 

166.83 180.93 B: you know know the bounds but [sigh] as for [noise] other things [sigh] you know i guess that personal problems of someone who's related but [sigh] if somebody who's in the limelight they're fair game for sure 

180.65 181.69 A: mhm 

181.07 191.47 B: you know uh no matter what the subject i mean some subjects i wouldn't [sigh] like but you know what the person has a right to go after that or even make fun of them i mean 

191.67 197.35 B: [sigh] 'cause you have some weird sick people who are out there who do make fun of cer- certain subjects that i would never make fun of 

196.79 198.55 A: right yeah mhm 

197.36 199.13 B: [sigh] i mean uh [sigh] 

199.25 202.32 B: you know no i would not go see somebody who's uh 

202.45 212.39 B: [sigh] into making fun of uh [sigh] uh what is it children or [sigh] or or like a sado mis- masochist kinda g- person or whatever [sigh] but uh there's things [noise] basic 

209.47 210.57 A: right 

212.50 215.30 B: basic [sigh] observational humor or 

215.12 221.89 B: body humor uh [sigh] uh everyday things occurrences like that sexual innuendos [sigh] 

221.71 232.83 B: those are all fine fair game and [sigh] and foul language well you know what that's the way a lot of people speak so if you have that you don't have to worry [sigh] i mean you're going to get into 

227.63 229.02 A: yeah yeah 

232.63 242.47 B: [sigh] risque business and therefore when you get into risque business [sigh] it may get raunchy so no one should be that offended especially if you go out [sigh] 

238.32 238.88 A: (( mm )) 

242.34 250.31 B: like to a comedy club to go see that you know if it's on t._v. however [sigh] you know they also have to use good judgment especially on 

249.72 250.64 A: right 

250.31 264.79 B: you know t._v. where [lipsmack] if it's [sigh] open to the public in terms of access you know [sigh] there are normal viewing hours where children may be watching but i would say that that type of stuff [sigh] should be pushed to to later on or [sigh] 

259.75 260.46 A: (( mhm )) 

264.65 268.69 B: if you have cable then those channels should be either you lock 'em or [sigh] 

268.80 276.83 B: you know you pay for premium so you know [sigh] to sort of do something where [sigh] your ch- kids don't have access to them [sigh] so so 

275.17 276.02 A: right 

277.29 279.12 B: (( [lipsmack] [sigh] and uh )) 

279.79 284.48 B: well like i said the other things making fun of people uh 

285.34 289.75 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] the on- all disabilities i think is going like over usually 

289.86 299.36 B: the line i would not make fu- fun of anybody who had a disability whether it be hand- [sigh] what do you call it speech impediment [sigh] blind deaf dumb [sigh] uh 

291.06 292.06 A: right 

299.50 311.21 B: [mn] walking handicap things of that nature [sigh] i mean they are [sigh] they used to be fair game years ago and and now you have sort of have made a taboo but [sigh] 

302.58 303.45 A: (( mhm right )) 

307.00 307.92 A: right 

311.39 317.56 B: i mean some some humor can be still made but i think you have to also know [sigh] where to go with it [mn] 

317.43 318.32 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

317.56 331.65 B: if if you've ever seen what is it the uh [lipsmack] the movie a fish called wanda uh [sigh] you'll know that there is [sigh] when they had him do the stutterer in there that was hilarious but it was done [laughter] very good [laughter] 

331.17 332.25 A: [laughter] 

331.75 333.72 B: (( did you ever see that movie [mn] )) 

333.22 334.62 A: no i haven't [laughter] 

333.57 347.17 B: no oh it was very g- it's one of the best movies wi- comedy wise [sigh] and you just got to see the guy who does the stutterer i think he's from uh monty python [sigh] tom tom kline oh i think his name is um [sigh] and he's 

342.37 343.10 A: uh-huh 

347.09 349.28 B: what was his name oh ke- kevin kline [sigh] 

349.23 364.03 B: is the other guy and [sigh] i forget what michael palin i think and there he he's torturing this guy and he can't say a word and he's stuttering he's trying to get information and it's just hilarious but [sigh] if it's if it's done like just to make some of someone per se because they stutter [sigh] 

358.05 358.80 A: [laughter] 

363.85 366.72 B: you know that just goes over the line [lipsmack] so 

364.88 365.89 A: right right 

367.16 371.91 B: but as for anything else like i said [sigh] deaf people i mean they sp- 

371.72 386.05 B: you know and the way they talk i mean [sigh] to make fun of them because of that is kind of mean spirited and therefore i wouldn't do it or wouldn't want to see somebody make that type of [sigh] whole long comedy like that i mean if you're going too go after somebody go after somebody [sigh] 

385.96 392.62 B: for usually what they do [sigh] or what they think as opposed to what they are [sigh] in terms of you know 

391.75 392.61 A: (( mhm )) 

393.05 398.32 B: [sigh] if you're black you're black if you're white you're white you know you didn't have you didn't have choose to do that that's what you are so 

398.14 399.61 B: [sigh] leave that alone 

399.44 411.19 B: you know but if you s- if you chose to do something stupid like commit a crime well you know what [laughter] the matter like you know wynona ryder if you like do something like that well you're you're now in fair game territory [sigh] 

399.50 400.24 A: right 

403.79 404.49 A: (( mhm )) 

407.77 409.16 A: right right 

411.14 417.20 B: you didn't weren't born that way you did that and you chose that and you got the money and the whole nine yards and therefore [sigh] 

412.65 413.50 A: uh-huh 

416.80 417.76 A: (( mhm )) 

417.12 427.27 B: anything she got from that is fair game and probably she wouldn't be had have done more to her because [sigh] it seems like she's still getting jobs which means you know wh- what's the point of uh 

427.32 433.48 B: [sigh] of something like that happening and then nothing's no no real punishment's being [sigh] dished out from it so [lipsmack] 

428.75 429.39 A: (( yeah )) 

433.15 433.74 A: (( mhm )) 

433.50 437.95 B: i kinda don't think you know that uh [sigh] excuse me [lipsmack] 

438.07 450.32 B: that uh you know that would be anything mean spirited even though some people say oh leave her alone uh no you know what [laughter] they're in the limelight they have a way of defending themselves they chose to do that [sigh] 

450.21 456.49 B: and this is the silliest if they're not getting punished well you know what then the only way they're really going to see any sort of punishment 

456.28 462.45 B: is by being made fun of [mn] i mean then you have [sigh] the infamous michael jackson i mean [laughter] 

457.96 458.88 A: right 

461.53 462.84 A: right uh-huh 

462.23 476.20 B: i mean you can [laughter] you can talk all day about that i mean [laughter] i mean if you ever saw that stupid special with h- with him with the the other one i mean that was [sigh] weird is the the word doesn't even describe [laughter] the [sigh] 

464.91 466.34 A: uh-huh [laughter] 

468.78 469.83 A: yeah yeah 

470.21 470.91 A: (( [laughter] )) 

472.32 472.91 A: (( mhm )) 

476.20 482.76 B: crazy and then he's now trying to defend himself like oh people got the misconception i don't know how they did that oh [sigh] 

481.11 481.87 A: (( right uh-huh )) 

482.24 483.52 A: (( yeah really )) 

482.68 495.11 B: so but how does you know [mn] you know i i have no problem with any com- comedian making fun of 'em in fact i think they ought to making fun of 'em i mean to if he doesn't [sigh] if he can't get the fact that some things [mn] 

491.18 492.15 A: uh-huh 

494.92 502.96 B: that people perceive of him as being weird [sigh] and it's not just [sigh] one or two people but the majority of people then he's got to take a step back and look and say 

501.03 501.84 A: right 

502.92 506.97 B: why the well either one of two things either he is weird or 

506.83 518.68 B: [lipsmack] excuse me he's trying to cover up and therefore make it perc- perceive that people i'm just this way and therefore don't think i'm a child molester or anything like that i mean [laughter] [laughter] [sigh] i mean but uh a few people have made [sigh] 

509.59 510.17 A: (( mhm )) 

514.32 515.04 A: uh-huh 

518.71 523.85 B: some real good comments about him uh jay leno's done some good stuff i've seen uh 

521.88 523.10 A: right right 

524.36 525.11 B: (( [lipsmack] [lipsmack] [sigh] )) 

525.24 534.75 B: dennis miller did a few good [sigh] comments on him he had a special recently which i loved and uh [lipsmack] but uh the other ones like i said i loved seeing 

529.36 529.99 A: uh-huh 

534.70 538.53 B: [sigh] a lot of the good comedians like i said favorite is 

538.44 540.99 B: [mn] dennis miller chris rock 

540.72 541.71 A: mhm 

540.87 550.05 B: [sigh] george cole and uh bill marr and [sigh] all of them get into areas that you would say well you know someone would say well that's not appropriate well so you know what 

549.89 562.63 B: it's their right and therefore they are doing it on their time and you know paying for it you have no objection to it surely [sigh] and therefore nothing is really over the line per se [sigh] long as it's done [sigh] 

556.22 557.05 A: right 

562.71 573.37 B: and they like have something at least to back it up on as opposed to being [sigh] just mean spirited to make fun of somebody [sigh] when there's nothing there to be made especially if there's no justification for it i mean 

568.62 569.64 A: right 

573.43 580.57 B: [sigh] you get all these things today i mean people are upset with the war [sigh] and there was oh they're making fun of president bush well you know what [sigh] 

577.12 577.94 A: (( right hm mhm )) 

580.74 590.06 B: you know you can make fun of the president if he did something stupid but just to make fun of him per se people who think he's stupid and meanwhile he's not to me he's just wrong because [sigh] 

588.90 589.93 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

589.92 599.95 B: he's not stupid and you're saying he's stupid then you're just being [sigh] a name caller but if he did something stupid you know like w- whatever if he's [sigh] you know if he's shipped over uh i don't know [sigh] 

593.63 594.69 A: mhm
