110.77 112.84 B: (( yeah there you go [laughter] )) 

111.73 122.67 A: yeah [laughter] when you get into the pedophile stuff um i mean you hear hear a lot of stuff you know hear the sex and stuff in in it but when you start i think when it gets too graphic 

114.00 115.36 B: [laughter] 

122.64 123.54 B: mhm 

122.74 127.32 A: and it gets too detailed and it goes into um i 

128.25 129.77 A: don't know [sigh] 

130.19 139.26 A: i guess really s- you know society wise unacceptable sexual behaviour [laughter] you know i don't want to hear about you know adults 

136.09 137.32 B: yeah 

139.38 141.47 A: even thinking about little kids 

141.65 142.93 B: yeah that 

142.29 144.10 A: that i wouldn't find humorous 

145.46 148.39 A: so [laughter] these calls are hard [laughter] 

147.75 150.24 B: i well this topic is hard 

149.64 157.35 A: it really is it's very difficult um but as far as acceptable humor um you can joke joke about just about anything 

157.30 158.29 B: (( uh mhm )) 

157.41 160.25 A: as long as it's done in a 

162.07 169.50 A: in in a way that is just meant to take something that is ludicrously stupid and so commonly sense stupid 

169.42 170.52 B: mhm 

170.12 173.14 A: and it's put out there as okay duh 

173.40 174.73 A: (( you know [laughter] )) 

174.42 175.75 B: right right 

175.34 178.76 A: but not presented in a way that you know 

179.68 182.10 A: [noise] i guess uh would offend anybody 

182.20 184.33 B: mm oh um 

182.41 185.27 A: unless they're that stupid [laughter] 

184.99 188.10 B: i think i was reading an article 

187.74 188.66 A: mhm 

188.24 189.24 B: um 

190.03 194.98 B: by miss manners i think [laughter] and it was actually talking about um 

192.46 193.40 A: uh-huh 

195.10 198.22 B: joking people who joke about death 

198.38 199.55 A: right 

199.20 204.85 B: so there's something that i don't think you should joke [laughter] about is death or anyone getting hurt or accident 

205.40 208.40 B: um anything like that i guess [noise] 

207.82 216.71 A: but at the same time we can all find humor though in in a lot of that stuff just because [noise] we've experienced like you know death is there it's gonna happen it happens to everybody 

216.95 218.66 A: uh a natural death 

217.10 218.42 B: but i mean death 

218.93 222.41 B: death in an immediate family or or anything like that 

219.16 219.90 A: (( uh )) 

222.10 223.10 A: was what 

223.56 225.43 A: oh yeah 

227.15 235.74 A: no that's not good i mean you can't take something that's serious and to the heart and try to make it funny that that's not good 

231.62 232.94 B: right right i 

233.41 234.74 B: (( definitely agree )) 

236.52 242.62 A: [noise] but as far as drawing the line a lot for me just [noise] i like good natured comedy 

243.03 244.06 B: good natured 

243.07 244.93 A: and humor [laughter] 

245.72 246.59 A: huh 

246.78 247.64 B: hello 

247.36 248.32 A: yeah 

248.10 251.19 B: sorry my cellphone has really bad reception [laughter] 

250.13 258.80 A: oh [laughter] but i like good natured humor you know i i i don't feel that they necessarily have to hurt anybody 

251.34 251.92 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

259.11 260.53 B: i agree with that 

260.27 262.83 A: you know to to make a joke 

262.71 263.56 B: (( uh-huh [mn] )) 

262.84 271.34 A: and [noise] if they do it's only [noise] because it's one of those things that's out there everybody's thinking it but everybody's afraid to say it 

271.32 272.36 B: mhm 

272.07 279.69 A: but i don't think that's meant to hurt i think that's meant to say yes we all think it and there it is now get rid of it [laughter] 

279.64 284.48 B: what about humor that that has the truth hidden in it 

285.82 293.17 A: well you know there's i think i think a lot of humor does have that in it and as long as it isn't put out there to deliberately hurt somebody 

292.78 294.50 B: mhm okay 

293.41 299.66 A: you know like like i said you know if if it's just put out there to say yes okay this is what we're all thinking but 

299.87 304.76 A: you know and here it is and it's in a nutshell and it's not hurting anybody but 

305.10 306.97 A: everybody's just afraid to say something 

308.08 309.23 A: do you know what i mean 

309.23 310.61 B: yeah 

310.16 312.15 A: okay [laughter] 

312.28 314.77 A: uh let's see drawing the line 

316.04 319.70 A: gosh ten minutes is a long time you know that [laughter] 

318.91 320.00 B: sorry 

320.67 323.15 A: i said ten minutes is a long time 

323.52 324.94 B: i know 

324.64 325.77 A: [laughter] 

325.15 331.48 B: er is this study to get information on what we think or just to get us to talk 'cause can't we talk about anything else 

329.49 334.67 A: i'm not sure i i honestly have no idea what it is totally about so 

334.14 335.21 B: okay 

335.25 337.64 A: i just know they call [sigh] so 

335.67 336.62 B: (( oh )) 

338.22 341.90 A: but um let's see back to the humor so we 

339.04 339.92 B: oh 

342.21 350.59 A: fulfil the requirement [laughter] um what do you what do you think though about humor that is [sigh] 

345.69 346.58 B: well 

350.66 355.62 A: [lipsmack] like when when when a comedian gets up and makes fun of their wife [laughter] 

355.56 366.15 B: no [laughter] well it depends what they're making fun of because i think a lot of comedians um i think their jokes aren't real because i think they just try to come up with funny um 

356.80 357.88 A: [laughter] 

366.76 372.98 B: funny things to talk about but mostly most likely the the thing that they're talking about hasn't actually happened 

368.19 369.14 A: right 

372.40 376.39 A: not to them but probably in somebody's house and somebody's gonna be able to relate to it 

376.40 378.44 B: yeah um 

377.61 388.57 A: so it's acceptable if it's put out there in a way that it isn't actually happening in their home even though he's saying it is um but somebody else could probably relate to it and get a kick out of it 

383.54 384.64 B: mhm 

388.44 390.45 B: [lipsmack] okay hold can you hold on a second 

389.87 390.71 A: sure [sigh] 

391.12 391.78 B: (( [noise] )) 

396.35 397.60 B: [noise] hello 

397.31 398.43 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

397.99 399.11 B: (( sorry )) 

398.95 400.31 A: (( that's all right [laughter] [noise] hm )) 

400.03 401.46 B: [laughter] um 

402.31 407.74 B: yeah but the thing is a lot of comedians i think the things that they make fun of are mostly stereotyped 

407.81 409.31 A: [noise] [noise] that's very true 

409.20 416.20 B: so they'll make fun of like uh they'll say like oh my wife you know she nags me a lot or something because they're stereotyping what a wife would do 

413.89 415.37 A: right 

416.86 417.77 B: um 

417.70 419.48 A: [noise] and you don't find that acceptable 

417.91 420.61 B: i think that's i think excuse me 

420.45 422.22 A: you don't find that acceptable 

421.99 429.26 B: no i think that's fine um but because i think that if you're gonna go and listen to a comedian um you should kind of go 

423.64 424.90 A: yeah 

429.50 433.69 B: expecting that you kn- you know the things that they're saying are jokes 

433.51 434.42 A: right 

434.55 437.19 B: what's unacceptable is probably 

437.31 443.08 B: i don't know maybe people who can't tell jokes and then therefore they're saying something that sounds really really offensive 

442.80 443.90 A: right 

443.48 447.22 B: or they're trying to make a joke at their wife's expense 

447.03 449.15 A: right at someone else's expense 

447.88 448.57 B: (( mm )) 

449.02 452.37 B: like at a family dinner or something i mean that's really not cool [laughter] 

452.04 453.33 A: (( right yeah )) 

453.51 462.34 A: well the one the one what i find you know what i find acceptable is when there's actually humor in it that doesn't cause another person pain 

459.88 460.59 B: (( hm )) 

462.48 464.43 A: if they're gonna be directing it 

465.03 466.60 A: at people in general 

467.47 469.05 A: do you think that's possible 

467.50 468.75 B: (( so like that pain )) 

469.16 472.53 B: so it's okay if there's humor but um 

472.61 478.32 B: what about if they're making fun of someone else 'cause then that person that they're making fun of might not be there 

478.74 480.10 B: (( but mhm )) 

478.89 488.58 A: yeah but it depends on what what part of them that they're making fun of you know i mean if it's something that we do on a daily basis that you know the person that you're talking about 

488.64 490.84 A: isn't it it thinks it's funny too 

491.80 492.60 B: okay 

492.30 502.08 A: [noise] [noise] you know then yeah i don't see a problem with that [noise] but if they're just going after somebody and attacking them out of viciousness because they think they can get a laugh out of it 

502.21 504.70 A: no i don't think that's acceptable 

506.88 509.29 A: i think that's bad humor [mn] 

509.44 510.09 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

509.91 514.59 A: i'm i've never been one of somebody else getting a laugh at my expense [laughter] 

515.62 516.48 A: so 

516.97 519.43 A: oh my goodness let's see what else [laughter] 

518.86 521.78 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] how many minutes has gone by [laughter] )) 

521.07 525.95 A: huh i don't know i forgot to time this [laughter] but uh 

521.90 523.29 B: (( hard topic )) 

526.16 526.91 B: (( [noise] )) 

526.23 535.62 A: oh let's see [sigh] um i don't i don't like humor i find uh what i find really unacceptable is the shock value humor 

529.60 530.42 B: (( [noise] )) 

536.13 536.90 B: uh-huh 

536.66 544.22 A: er people that they get up on stage and they're telling a story and then all of a sudden they come out with this hideous ending 

544.71 546.01 B: such as 

544.84 547.02 A: that er is shocking 

547.93 549.91 B: um can you give me an example 

549.42 551.05 A: oh gosh 

551.45 562.50 A: well we were watching this not too long ago i'm trying to remember what the whole jist of it was it was i don't know it was about a it was some he was going on about actually it was his own life 

562.44 570.01 A: and he was doing it in a humorous way and it was something that had happened and he was telling this wonderful story about him and his father 

570.12 573.06 A: and it turned into this horrible tragic ending 

573.16 576.45 A: and i was like okay i don't i didn't like that [laughter] 

573.59 574.54 B: (( oh wow )) 

575.70 578.47 B: (( yeah okay that's not good )) 

576.47 580.67 A: you know and yeah and and he laughed 

580.88 585.67 A: you know like it was a joke when to me it was oh my god you need therapy 

585.91 587.42 A: (( [laughter] you know )) 

586.49 590.92 B: do you think he's just sick minded or he's saying it to help him get over certain issues 

590.54 596.33 A: that's what i don't you know i either way i don't think that's the right place to be airing it 

595.73 596.87 B: right 

596.49 599.95 A: you know when to to talk about something like that and
