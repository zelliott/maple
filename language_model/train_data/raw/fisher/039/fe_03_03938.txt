0.95 2.19 B: hello 

1.82 3.11 A: hello 

2.91 4.55 B: this is lily who's this 

4.60 6.33 A: i'm vencat 

5.74 7.28 B: hi how are you 

7.09 8.42 A: (( good how are you )) 

7.29 9.15 B: so what do you think about humor 

9.58 11.24 A: ah pardon 

11.09 13.87 B: humor what do you think about questionable humor 

14.01 17.46 A: yeah humor is necessary in life i think 

17.51 21.31 B: yeah i think so too i think it's really interesting that um 

21.51 33.09 B: that some people draw the line when they talk about humor in the sense that they um they basic they basically like do things that are too political or too religious 

28.58 29.40 A: uh-huh 

34.59 36.84 A: ah i'm no i don't think so 

38.10 41.97 B: so you don't think that humor like has a line to be drawn 

42.17 44.97 A: yeah i don't think there is ah any line to be drawn 

45.37 48.57 A: as long as the other person doesn't get offended 

48.56 49.56 B: no 

50.53 62.67 B: well i mean people do get offended though there's definitely a line subseque- subsequently because people like hear th- they hear things they get offended so for example racial slurs eth- ethnic slurs like 

62.52 66.56 B: it's not proper to say like those kind of words over broadcasts 

66.22 69.14 A: uh-huh yeah that's right like as long as 

69.30 75.81 A: ah it's it doesn't contravene law it's within ah any legal framework i i think it's fine 

76.06 77.97 B: yeah w- people get a 

76.17 78.71 A: humor there there's no need 

79.18 81.71 B: people get offended by that kind of stuff though 

81.87 90.10 A: yeah so if it's going to be under law whatever it's legal requirements then that is wrong one should not do it so people get offended so they 

91.66 92.51 B: hello 

93.62 94.55 A: hello 

94.28 100.19 B: oh i'm sorry the phone just like cut out out of nowhere um no actually i really think that 

97.14 98.20 A: oh okay 

100.20 112.10 B: a lot the time when people are on television and they um say things that oftentimes like people get in trouble or in newsprint for example you're reading the text which is the same as like 

109.02 109.94 A: uh-huh 

112.02 125.98 B: it's just like you know newspaper is dialogue so when people write things that aren't true it's considered slanderous so that because the law like recognizes slander as a type of offence that's you know that's conclusive that language can offend people 

122.40 123.38 A: uh-huh 

126.28 135.40 A: yeah that that's right but thing is what i sometimes feel is like ah the person who feels that that he possibly being 

135.47 142.74 A: more like used as a as an object of humor he thinks that it's racial but the person who actually is ah 

142.95 144.90 A: ah causing that 

145.03 149.04 A: ah he may not be think having the perspective like ah 

149.05 151.03 A: (( like i i'll tell you like )) 

151.04 156.32 A: if you are sitting there in a corner and the two other people are ah just looking at you 

156.42 160.92 A: and they are laughing you'll probably think that they are laughing at you it may not be true 

161.63 162.57 A: isn't it 

162.36 167.13 B: yeah but i don't think it's that's necessarily true like honestly when it comes to 

167.41 179.78 B: like that kind of interpretation like people can feel that that's like our sixth sense like we know the intent like that's why people get that's why there's such thing as sarcasm like sarcasm completely undermines like truth 

178.89 180.42 A: mhm 

179.95 194.47 B: and that's the thing it's all about the levels of understanding the text or the language and textually speaking if there's sarcasm there or if someone's like you know that's why actually with the progression of the english language satire was really really a phenomenon 

184.29 185.50 A: (( yeah but )) 

194.27 198.07 B: like people weren't used to that like that kind of like sub text analysis 

196.06 196.98 A: (( uh-huh )) 

198.31 202.01 A: yeah i yeah i agree i agree with this point 

202.06 203.76 B: well there you have it 

203.49 206.03 A: yeah you are right [laughter] 

205.59 210.57 B: so it's people can be offended and that's why there's a multitude of reasonings and rationale 

210.46 211.80 A: mhm 

211.17 214.45 B: well that's the point that's how wars get started i mean 

214.72 228.07 B: no i shouldn't say that because i really don't understand why wars are started because i i'm not in the military and i have no military training but if i was like a general if i was like napoleon i could explain to you how like like 

222.92 223.86 A: uh-huh 

228.04 239.20 B: our country was established based off of tax like america started based off of an emancipation what did we t- look it's one group of people telling another group of people that they no longer want to be together 

232.20 233.04 A: uh-huh 

239.14 240.05 B: like that's 

239.35 240.59 A: yeah 

239.95 246.60 B: that's the f- one of the first times like up until then we just killed each other but like we had the buffer of sea so 

244.12 245.14 A: yeah 

246.46 261.28 B: the between the buffer of the two countries it was just like the r- the text alone had people come over and i mean like there was one maybe one person would show up like a soldier and say like listen my general says it's time for us to go to war but mostly it was by mail 

252.62 253.43 A: uh-huh 

261.63 263.97 A: yeah yeah uh-huh 

261.82 263.05 B: by cargo 

263.74 269.19 B: and then they'd be like sorry and then that's it the next thing you know there's like all these people showing up and like 

269.13 274.82 B: you know and it was about commerce like the natives were here we needed there was like more land and like 

274.74 285.46 B: with their text we read that like there was plants landscape wise and that's why there's like landscape writing like ah they call it like yeah like landscape writing or like ah 

282.03 282.96 A: uh-huh 

285.54 299.99 B: novel based off of trifid i forgot what the word is or but it's like when you have a tra- oh a travel log travel logs were sent over to europe being like listen this is the situation we've never seen trees like this we've never seen people who look like this like you got to get over here 

291.12 292.57 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

298.22 299.30 A: mhm 

299.82 312.91 B: and then the same with like that's why there's like a joke like i when i learned in in geography class about greenland there was always a joke around it that greenland was told by the vikings to be green but in reality it was brown they just borrowed the money 

307.21 308.12 A: (( mhm )) 

311.62 314.01 A: [laughter] yeah 

313.42 315.18 B: so did you know that joke 

314.99 317.16 A: yeah yeah i [laughter] 

317.87 320.14 B: [noise] yeah and iceland was a better one 

319.97 323.08 A: uh-huh you know a lot of history it's it's 

324.14 325.87 A: it's really interesting 

325.23 326.47 B: i'm sorry 

328.42 330.60 B: i don't like what 

330.73 334.78 B: i don't know if i'm allowed to talk to you about anything other than the subject that we picked 

335.47 337.38 B: otherwise i'd ask you like 

337.48 340.05 B: what's going on but i don't think i'm supposed to 

340.26 350.86 B: like i think i'm just supposed to talk to you so i'm not g- i'm going to avoid asking you any personal questions about like like schools and whatever like i think i'm only supposed to talk to you about language that's the topic that they gave us 

340.32 341.88 A: yeah 

346.99 347.75 A: uh-huh 

350.87 354.23 A: yeah that that that that's right the thing is i'm ah 

354.28 357.40 A: like we are ah incorporating history into humor 

357.95 359.65 A: that's what i'm mentioning 

359.10 362.75 B: yeah oh yeah yeah yeah definitely i sort of see what you're saying 

359.72 362.06 A: it's kind of interesting like 

362.68 364.38 A: yeah yeah like you are bringing 

365.19 367.93 A: history into humor which is very difficult 

368.28 380.63 A: like people usually consider history as a subject which is very boring but there's no more in that basically it is something where ah peoples fought and people ah like the 

371.92 372.87 B: right 

379.13 382.84 B: well yeah but that's because pe- from people like 

382.68 389.15 B: i was just telling a friend of mine like i think the natural progression of the world is that text and books will be obsolete because 

388.96 396.05 B: the way people see history is just a bunch of words in a dusty book what they're missing out is that there was a whole like 

393.08 394.11 A: yeah that 

395.87 409.62 B: people understand textually that like for example that christopher columbus existed but because they never read the travel accounts they never like really looked into the dates as to when what things happened when they'd they or 

401.02 401.94 A: uh-huh 

409.57 419.52 B: actually the most important aspect of written language is t- is ah artifact and what i mean by artifact i mean like you can't like if you notice like how important um 

414.32 415.66 A: yeah because that 

419.36 429.23 B: like you see a thing in a museum like a painting well the script that's next to that painting is of huge importance because without it you'd never know what that thing actually was 

422.05 422.96 A: uh-huh 

425.50 426.51 A: (( yeah that's )) 

428.62 435.84 A: yeah that that's right that's what i'm saying hist- actually human history would not have occurred without humor 

430.47 432.00 B: (( you know what i'm saying [noise] )) 

436.01 439.32 A: because if you are not humorous if you don't like humor 

439.37 448.18 A: there there is no way you you'll feel your life ah life to be interesting if it's not interesting how can there be progress in life basically 

447.92 460.03 B: yeah it it's very strange i like caught a little bit of what you said but like i'm sorry like i'm i'm really thinking about this history thing like i'm trying to understand like better as to why like 

460.14 461.22 B: um 

461.45 467.83 B: why people are moving away from written language what because i think like i think of um 

464.49 465.38 A: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

468.18 473.29 B: of the computers a lot and like what um 'cause like computers are a new form of text 

473.12 478.70 B: people haven't really thought about it too much like it's they're just starting to understand that like the internet is like huge 

478.46 489.52 B: because it's text that's alive it's constantly changing it's ever changing like imagine holding a book and the like the story changing within the book constantly that's what the internet is 

478.83 479.55 A: yeah 

487.81 488.70 A: uh-huh 

489.17 490.92 A: yeah yeah that's right 

490.43 495.82 B: so when people look through the through that box and what they're seeing isn't the same thing twice 

495.64 509.33 B: the time changes the date changes the stories change you press a r- you press reload and you're sped up through a future do you know what i mean like a few screens ago i- that was the past but the thing that you see 

504.29 505.15 A: uh-huh 

509.39 514.53 B: new is what's going on now and that it's kind of like a cerebral consciousness 

514.60 520.73 A: but but does that mean that there's ah nothing like which is reality or which is truth 

521.41 525.91 B: i don't know that's the it's a question of the truth it's of what is truth 

521.67 524.37 A: (( does that mean does )) 

524.76 525.45 A: uh-huh 

526.64 528.33 B: there is no truth 

526.95 527.67 A: (( ah )) 

528.19 534.35 A: ah ha i i don't know i i think there is a s- there is a reason for existence that 

534.43 536.49 A: (( like it's not that there's not truth )) 

536.87 540.14 A: there is some truth and in fact everyone is after that 

540.35 541.20 A: so 

540.44 551.69 B: i don't know i don't know about there being truth or not it's hard to determine i mean descartes thought that there was such thing as truth and he he used mathematics so yes there is truth because the universe is in blue shift 

547.66 548.54 A: uh-huh 

551.75 556.92 B: you know like what is it blue shift or red shift i forgot red shift is backwards or forwards 

557.12 560.16 A: mhm ah no i i don't know this one 

560.23 561.94 B: the universe is going 

562.09 564.15 B: forwards right now they know that much 

564.51 565.74 A: oh okay 

565.77 573.68 B: they used to be that the universe was i- they determined that based off of i'll explain it to you you're going to think i'm crazy but listen 

569.53 571.35 A: mhm 

573.58 586.69 B: they determined the universe is going forward because the farthest telescope like you know we've got f- like we've got fiber optics we have like electromagnetic waves like we can read space right so the farthest we can read space is quasars 

573.76 574.63 A: (( mhm )) 

584.04 586.21 A: yeah no where is it going 

586.80 591.16 A: yeah yeah i i know that but where is it going i never heard it's going 

591.84 594.91 B: it's going forward [noise] 

593.65 595.09 A: which direction 

595.02 599.89 B: yeah it's go- because the quasars are in different i i think the reason why is because the quasars
