43.60 47.01 B: uh i didn't take it you know i didn't hear it when they called or whatever 

47.25 55.70 A: [mn] so we're supposed supposed to be talking about off the cuff comedy as opposed to acceptable humor 

47.65 48.50 B: so 

56.62 68.43 B: do you think they really care what you talk [laughter] about i thought it just had to do with they wanted to know like different sounds and voices and how the sounds come through if you're on a regular phone or cellphone or whatever 

68.28 69.51 A: you know i 

68.51 69.53 B: but uh 

69.62 71.60 A: go ahead i'm sorry 

70.84 83.35 B: oh that's okay [laughter] um i i tried calling one day to get some more information but um i don't know if they ever really answer the phone in person seems like they just call you back and then i never get to talk to anyone 

83.06 86.05 A: how did you get connected with this 

85.74 87.82 B: um they had an ad in the paper 

88.85 90.40 A: because i was 

90.45 92.86 A: signing up with some uh 

93.18 105.64 A: oh just general marketing companies they have their own databases and then i was signing up for mystery shops and this box popped up on the computer 

96.19 97.34 B: mhm 

99.07 100.14 B: mhm 

105.45 106.58 B: mhm 

105.81 111.58 A: would you like to get paid for talking on the phone and i thought well who wouldn't you know 

110.77 112.37 B: yeah [laughter] really 

111.72 117.49 A: so i signed up for it and and i understand it's the university of pennsylvania 

117.62 119.93 B: that's what it said in the ad i think 

117.72 118.59 A: is be- 

120.00 128.12 B: [noise] i'm curious on uh how many of them you can do um if they limit it to three or you can do more than three or i don't know 

127.74 138.81 A: well i don't know i mean uh i i know so little about it all i did was you know fill in a couple of boxes with name and email and so forth and that was it 

138.48 143.31 B: well that'd be interesting to see um when they pay too [laughter] 

143.14 148.66 A: well i did talk to this uh feller from rochester new york 

148.34 149.48 B: mhm 

148.93 154.76 A: and [cough] pardon me he said that his wife's been doing this for some time 

154.69 155.67 B: oh 

155.44 161.52 A: which might lead you to believe you know that maybe it's it's an ongoing thing 

161.88 163.08 B: oh i don't know 

161.91 162.78 A: but i 

163.24 168.22 A: i'd like to know what it is they're even trying to to assess you know 

168.30 179.27 B: aye i'm assuming you know since all these different topics and stuff every day that that's supposed i would think just something to give you something to start talking about 

172.92 178.73 A: (( yeah )) 

179.49 180.52 B: (( i don't know )) 

180.31 185.30 A: but i mean i wonder what the study is trying to measure phone use or 

185.84 194.21 B: well it sounds to me like clar- like um [lipsmack] uh voice uh voice it seems to me like it's voice your voice how how 

193.08 197.34 A: oh the quality of transmission maybe voice 

195.77 202.25 B: maybe yeah or maybe what they're doing is study on just people um like their accents and 

200.46 204.97 A: (( yeah )) 

202.33 205.10 B: you know different things like that who knows 

205.90 211.98 A: i don't know it uh it it i'm just would be curious to know who's behind it too 

206.03 207.05 B: (( but uh )) 

211.93 213.06 B: mhm 

212.61 214.02 A: i mean i know it's 

214.35 224.12 A: not something that uh any university would just do on their own i mean they obviously get the funding probably from a bunch of phone companies or 

224.19 226.54 A: companies that make phones 

226.65 230.64 A: what do you do in your real life besides talk on the phone are you 

229.78 232.74 B: [laughter] i sell wine 

232.90 234.57 A: you sell wine 

234.19 238.12 B: uh-huh i sell to restaurants and hotels i'm a broker 

237.86 241.75 A: well how great i mean are you on your own or do you work for 

240.77 243.01 B: yeah no i work for myself 

243.23 247.69 A: do you sell uh all over the world or just 

246.11 253.81 B: no just basically in the county that i live in and it's orange county i live halfway between l._a. and san diego and um 

252.89 255.84 A: uh-huh what kind of wines do you sell 

255.53 263.88 B: oh from all over the world from california chile or just you know france italy everywhere and i sell beer and spirits too 

261.56 262.58 A: are you f- 

263.93 269.12 A: are you finding the uh uh volume of french wine going down 

268.93 279.82 B: i never sold too many of them to begin with it was one of my least requested uh types of wine before all this this stuff happened so um and it hasn't affected me at all 

278.00 285.37 A: do you think that's because the quality of california wine is so good 

283.82 285.95 B: mm well actually i 

285.81 300.27 B: i think from a long time ago maybe people kind of thought that french wine was expensive and then they started buying california wines which got more prevalent and but then what happened california wines started getting really um high end and then 

300.28 309.69 B: um right now south american wines are very popular 'cause they're perceived to be better buys i mean they are the the quality of their wines and everything are um 

310.53 311.65 B: very good 

311.65 316.79 A: well i think that chilean wines are excellent the few that i've had 

314.86 315.79 B: yeah 

316.40 319.13 B: yeah they're pretty much good they all are 

317.20 318.20 A: (( um )) 

319.07 330.03 A: i've had some wines i think they were made in israel too that were not bad but i tell you if you want some of the worst wine in the world order texas wine 

324.79 325.57 B: (( mm well )) 

329.70 341.06 B: oh really i i i can't say that i've ever had anybody even talk about texas wines or offer them before so um and [laughter] they must make very little [laughter] 

340.57 346.37 A: well actually they don't they they have quite a volume i mean we've got an enormous uh 

346.43 350.06 A: area here in texas that's called the hill country 

349.81 351.16 B: mhm 

350.52 354.59 A: and what it is is it's basically uh 

354.57 363.81 A: [lipsmack] oh kind of a geological band between what in in uh east texas is very flat including the houston area 

363.55 364.97 B: mhm 

363.76 370.74 A: and then when you move out to west texas you actually get some mountains that go up to seven eight and nine thousand feet 

370.58 371.64 B: mhm 

371.08 384.58 A: but transiting between these two plains you've got what we call the hill country [lipsmack] and everybody and their mother's trying to grow wine there and there are actually about six or seven uh 

380.44 381.54 B: mhm 

385.50 389.83 A: what do you call vintner someone that sells wine commercially 

388.06 388.99 B: yeah 

389.76 392.87 B: well vineyards uh wine- wineries 

389.90 391.06 A: there's 

392.61 398.06 A: yeah there's about six or seven uh wineries right now that are selling wine 

398.49 404.41 A: and but out of them there's only one that people even consider decent 

404.50 407.16 B: and why do you think the other ones are so bad 

404.61 406.20 A: and it 

407.15 414.15 A: well i'm not really sure if you have people in there that don't know what they're doing if perhaps the 

414.20 419.91 A: uh climate is not just you know a hundred percent right uh 

420.04 422.65 B: what varietal of grapes are they growing 

422.56 427.86 A: [lipsmack] well they grow uh red and uh there's a few 

426.84 430.59 B: red's not a varietal [laughter] [laughter] 

429.39 432.26 A: i don't know what's a varietal i don't know 

431.31 431.99 B: a 

432.36 442.00 B: varietal is like a cabernet grape or merlot grape or a zinfandel grape or there's actually ten thousand different types of grapes produced 

440.95 455.07 A: well the only wine apparently that people consider decent is a cabernet uh but you're talking to somebody that knows probably as much about wine as i know about the surface of 

446.32 447.44 B: uh-huh 

454.84 456.99 A: of jupiter you know 

456.09 457.75 B: [laughter] 

457.85 461.98 B: well you don't have to know anything except uh what you like [laughter] what tastes good to you 

462.18 473.11 A: well i'm always fascinated by the number of people i've run into over the years that actually have tried to grow grapes and and produce wine 

470.66 471.66 B: mhm 

473.54 475.08 A: and uh 

475.26 479.71 A: i'd say just about all of them have fallen flat on their face 

479.17 487.37 B: that's 'cause it requires a lot of money a lot of patience you know once they plant the grapes it's five years 'til they can harvest anything and then um 

487.54 493.19 B: when you consider the i mean if they're gonna do it commercially when you consider the cost of um 

493.34 499.38 B: oh the cost of the land first of all the labor to do it then the cost of just saving the uh [lipsmack] 

499.52 510.27 B: you know glass bottle or uh label all of that i mean i don't know how anyone can sell bottled wine for ten dollars unless you're huge huge place you know like gallo or something like that 

509.77 515.11 A: mhm uh what is robert mondavi still around 

514.88 516.82 B: yes as far as i know 

517.14 519.89 A: i used to uh when i 

519.81 532.28 A: was practicing oh back in the eighties i used to go out to california quite a bit and try to sneak as many bottles as i could out of the state and uh 

528.51 530.52 B: (( mhm )) 

531.20 532.39 B: mhm 

532.46 535.29 A: of course it get quite heavy you know 

534.43 535.55 B: mhm 

535.80 539.90 A: but uh i always loved their burgundy their cabernet 

540.26 541.31 B: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

540.65 552.80 A: um eh how many of good wineries are there in california 

548.28 552.17 B: oh there's thousands of them there really are there's just tonnes 

553.13 559.09 B: and um it's just amazing it's it's such a competitive it's such a competitive business 

554.17 556.15 A: so who is there anyone that 

557.61 566.93 A: has is there anyone that really has the corner where do the california wines go by the way all over the world 

566.32 568.47 B: yes they do mhm 

568.54 570.92 A: do they stay in the state much 

571.66 576.80 B: oh again it depends on how big the the winery is if they produce enough 

576.69 591.60 B: a lot of the small boutique wineries don't produce enough and they can sell basically what they bottle right out of their winery and then and then it doesn't even go beyond that it doesn't even get to the rest of the state so it really really depends on the size of the winery 

592.81 594.12 A: well how did you 

593.12 593.88 B: so 

594.31 597.05 A: how did you get into brokering wine 

597.68 599.89 B: oh i don't know i started about thirteen
