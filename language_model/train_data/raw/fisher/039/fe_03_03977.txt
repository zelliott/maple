16.20 21.04 B: [laughter] oh well what's the top- i didn't understand what they wanted us to talk about 

21.18 26.10 B: what we thought of comedy in general is that what they're kind of getting at are you thinking 

25.29 32.10 A: i think so they said um where where do you draw the line between good taste and bad taste in comedy 

30.94 34.50 B: right uh so give me your express example [noise] 

34.12 40.84 A: um i don't know i figure like it's such a personal thing what what i think is appropriate isn't necessarily what you do you know 

40.26 42.37 B: right i uh right 

42.51 43.32 B: um 

42.77 43.58 A: but 

43.52 48.07 B: i like comedy i like to watch comedy on on on the comedy channel actually 

48.08 52.28 B: so i like all kinds of certain stuff comedy you know humor wise i can go 

52.69 56.31 B: [noise] um i'm not offended very very easily put it that way 

56.26 58.01 A: me neither yeah 

58.11 59.03 B: um 

58.43 59.76 A: i mean uh 

59.79 65.13 A: the feeling uh like i don't like when people hurt other people's feelings you know so much but 

59.90 60.74 B: [laughter] 

65.33 77.35 B: [noise] well you know i there is a few uh instances where you can deal with it you know 'cause it's funny to a point but then it also sometimes it be get too sickening with them too 

78.55 80.06 A: (( right [noise] )) 

79.13 84.51 B: you know what i mean i mean so it depends on what they're actually what what who they're talking about er i mean 'cause they 

84.68 93.39 B: if you think about it they do talk of comedy and humor is a lot involved with superstars movie stars and such you know what i mean so some of it's 

89.51 91.06 A: (( [noise] exactly [noise] )) 

93.59 96.39 B: all in fun too and not all of it's for real 

97.41 101.34 B: so it depends on what you're taking in in stride i guess with the humor 

101.83 104.33 B: everybody everybody takes it differently 

104.88 105.46 B: (( [noise] )) 

105.63 106.87 A: yeah that's true 

106.52 108.18 B: [laughter] 

107.34 108.71 A: [laughter] 

108.33 110.69 B: [laughter] go go for it your turn 

110.16 111.36 A: [laughter] 

112.11 113.17 A: um 

113.21 119.83 A: i yeah i'm like you like i find i don't find that much stuff funny but uh like i like different types of humor 

121.04 126.85 B: and uh d- do you go to comedy like uh not other than t._v. do you like go in bars or 

126.86 129.34 B: or any comedy clubs anything like that 

129.51 135.07 A: yeah i mean like i like the impromptu stuff i always think that's pretty funny when it's off the cuff and 

135.15 138.04 A: um you know stand up acts and stuff 

138.83 145.97 B: [noise] [noise] yeah well that's where a lot of the lot of the um people start is just right there you know with the impromptu before they even get anywhere 

146.46 152.98 B: but no i i i like all sorts of of humor and comedy um i mean it can be 

153.99 162.56 B: i don't know if you're talking t._v. for instance they have so many different kinds of comedy i mean it could range from any of there from kid comedy to adult comedy 

162.64 163.51 A: right 

163.20 164.09 B: um 

164.62 173.83 B: and you know when they're talking about the kids i don't like the idea that some of the comedy they they do have comedy with kids on on on shows that i um a lot of 

174.00 182.92 B: a lot of it i mean to a point it's like they use a lot of uh nasty words for my little my i have a little three year old grandson that catches on [laughter] too easy you know 

182.77 184.27 A: right [laughter] 

183.70 187.05 B: [laughter] but i mean i guess with [noise] uh 

188.45 190.17 B: it's depending on 

190.34 196.10 B: [noise] i mean again how you take that as well and uh when you're around the house um 

196.46 199.99 B: i'm i like to joke around a lot we're always we're joking around here 

200.41 205.27 B: so we're always in humor and c- [laughter] you know i could just as well be a stand up comedian around the house 

204.80 205.95 A: [laughter] 

205.32 206.28 B: [laughter] 

206.99 211.98 A: well yeah 'cause like i don't i don't know how to define bad taste necessarily 

212.18 217.81 A: but comedy's definitely important you know having fun and not taking things too seriously 

217.50 220.52 B: [noise] right like i said it depends on how serious you take everything 

220.42 221.40 A: right 

221.08 224.93 B: i mean because uh when you talk when you're in when you're c- something's in common you're thinking of 

225.18 231.59 B: oh and personal taste i mean everybody has got personal taste um and i always look at it 

232.16 244.93 B: if you don't like it you either walk away or whatever switch the channel whatever you have the choice you have that opportunity if you don't like it to either turn around walk away or turn the channel or whatever it is that you're what is in front of you you know what i mean 

245.10 248.84 A: exactly you don't have to sit there and be offended by it 

245.76 246.46 B: (( you know )) 

247.42 256.58 B: right right so i defined i don't know i guess it's really hard like you were saying it's i understand it's really hard and to to how do we define comedy what they want to know from us 

257.13 260.40 A: right i i don't know i it's so different like what 

257.58 258.48 B: let me 

260.47 264.19 A: you know i find strange things funny i find you know like 

263.29 263.86 B: (( [noise] )) 

264.60 277.12 A: pointing out observations about life and you know parenthood and all that stuff that stand up comedians do funny but i don't find like fart humor funny or something like that [laughter] as much depending on who it's coming from i guess [laughter] but 

273.24 275.33 B: oh [laughter] right you see that 

276.83 281.18 B: you know that something knocks your door if you're if you think about it a guy probably would [laughter] 

281.03 282.47 A: right [laughter] 

281.80 289.63 B: and so it it again it depends on uh the a different person different situation but i don't think it's funny either i'm not i'm not a 

290.05 296.39 B: eh farting is not like um i to be honest like beavis and butthead they're not i don't think it's funny but my husband does 

296.18 297.58 A: [laughter] right exactly 

296.62 298.92 B: [laughter] i think they're gross 

297.79 298.62 A: [laughter] 

298.98 299.93 A: [laughter] 

299.30 301.99 B: but now like south park is funny but then that 

301.19 302.94 A: yeah it is 

302.20 306.95 B: but then but then that's a different i don't know they're just different i don't know they're 

307.09 307.90 B: they're 

307.92 317.13 B: beavis and butthead are stupid [laughter] more than anything and where south parks are kids and they're just trying to be kids and at the same time trying to keep and i don't know 

310.10 311.02 A: [laughter] 

316.95 319.99 A: right well there's something smart about it you know 

320.02 323.18 B: oh it's again it's something i don't want my grandson to watch 

320.19 321.88 A: south park it is 

323.31 324.62 A: (( right right [laughter] )) 

323.33 324.96 B: 'cause of all the language 

324.97 326.73 B: [laughter] but i like it 

325.17 333.29 A: well it's not and some yeah some people think that if they just swear you know constantly that that's funny but i don't necessarily agree 

334.64 340.09 B: it's too uh south park's still good i mean i l- i like i i don't know that i can't say i hate that 

340.14 346.07 B: um some of the time er it it's kind of s- they got some stupid parts in it so all of it's not always for me you know what i mean 

344.08 345.02 A: [laughter] 

345.88 350.02 A: right but it is it's it's good you know it's good fun 

350.11 353.84 B: [noise] but for the most part i have to say i like south park [laughter] 

353.68 354.86 A: yeah 

354.57 364.59 B: so and see now right see we just got about agree- disagreement that we just had earlier first we said we didn't didn't like them kind of things but yet south park does some of the things we don't like and it's funny 

358.63 359.55 A: [laughter] 

364.48 365.71 A: right 

364.79 366.94 B: you know so how do you define the 

365.78 373.36 A: well i think it's [laughter] it's [laughter] it's only that you know it's little kids you know getting involved it's cute and 

367.33 368.30 B: [laughter] 

371.55 381.12 B: right like i said beavis and butthead they're like a little more adult and they should have been more adult and act more stupider where beavis and butthead like er i mean uh south park are more like the kid sort of 

374.89 375.89 A: right 

381.20 382.46 B: it's funny 

382.64 390.70 B: i think that's what we got i didn't know i mean not all the south park are kids and it's still it's kind of funny [laughter] but i mean for the most part you know 

388.03 389.84 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

391.45 402.84 B: i guess i'm a i'm into i like fox i watch fox t._v. a lot you know and they have a lot of com- um situation with you know malcolm in the middle and all that kind of stuff and and simpsons we watch all that stuff all the time 

402.66 404.54 A: yeah i like the simpsons 

405.20 408.98 B: it's in our and and so that's different too i don't know why but i like that one too 

405.49 406.27 A: so 

410.05 410.80 B: so 

410.78 417.13 A: do you find any like regional differences being from like the mid west area 'cause i grew up in michigan so i 

417.47 418.84 B: [noise] [noise] like what do you mean 

418.81 424.14 A: don't know i mean like different types of humor like you know they have redneck humor and stuff like uh like 

422.67 424.05 B: [noise] i know well 

424.53 425.80 A: (( f- [mn] fox worthy )) 

425.36 433.63 B: yeah um [sigh] yeah i guess uh he's okay but you know he gets it's all i guess after a while he gets it's monotonous 

433.44 434.38 A: right 

433.99 441.76 B: you know so i guess i wouldn't really care for that either so that's not really come- it's comedy but yet it's to me it's not really 

441.91 447.20 B: i guess i'll i'd listen to it and you know laugh to a few of them but after a while you get tired of hearing it you know 

447.02 454.16 A: i know you get like the emails that have like the fifty lines on it and you can just scan through that but [laughter] 

454.17 455.37 B: (( [laughter] yeah [laughter] )) 

454.56 456.62 A: yeah that's really fun [laughter] 

456.93 471.11 B: well like my father-in-law has this this fox worthy tape and you know i mean oh we put it in and i'll laugh for a while and after a while i'm just like let's take this out i just can't finish it because it's just i don't know it's not all funny to me it's just stupid some of it it's just another stupid thing of being funny 

464.69 465.73 A: [laughter] 

471.00 471.97 A: right 

472.01 478.41 B: but then again he's an adult thinking he's funny i guess so i mean if you if you like him you know you're and he's funny 

474.89 475.95 A: [laughter] 

478.86 482.92 B: i suppose too in his own way he really is they're just not in my type [laughter] 

482.79 483.90 A: yeah 

483.66 487.88 B: it's not my kind of i'm not um and like joan rivers 

487.92 489.69 B: i don't quite care for that 

489.78 493.30 B: she overdoes it you know what i mean [laughter] 

490.03 491.07 A: right 

491.27 495.79 A: [laughter] but she also looks like an alien right now too she's 

496.71 499.62 A: she just looks weird lately have you seen her recently 

499.31 501.52 B: [noise] no no i haven't 

500.58 508.76 A: oh my gosh er she's had so much plastic surgery that i don't know how she can make any comments about anyone else 'cause she just looks like 

509.22 512.78 A: completely pulled back and fake and plastic 

512.10 520.59 B: [noise] [noise] but now i see now i don't quite care for her she her com- she's not like i don't care for that either because of the way she 

520.80 531.09 B: she pretty m- i don't know if want to call it running somebody down or if you want to call it just plain being rude about people or there i mean everybody has differences but that's just somewhat overboard sometimes you know 

530.86 532.21 A: yeah i agree 

531.17 532.57 B: she just 

533.24 536.45 B: [noise] i don't know i don't i watched this i saw one a couple of years ago where uh 

536.55 541.82 B: a star it was on a soap opera late i can't remember and she walked up to one gal and she goes 

541.68 553.06 B: [lipsmack] and you're not as pretty as most of the gals i'm like oh my god i can't believe she said that you know [laughter] and then they all laugh everybody thought and it was on a it was on like a a comedian talk show and they were laughing about it and i thought it was kind of 

545.01 546.10 A: [laughter] 

553.10 559.93 B: you know and they were they were talking about how rude she was you know and she was supposed to be funny and how rude she was and i'd never forgotten that 

560.33 561.46 A: yeah 

562.35 562.94 B: (( [noise] )) 

562.86 568.90 A: like i said i don't i don't like when people are just all about putting other people down for you know trying to be funny 

563.04 563.60 B: (( [noise] )) 

566.94 567.98 B: yeah 

568.69 571.43 B: yeah it just doesn't work for me either 

572.31 576.15 B: [noise] but then again now we're if we were sitting at a bar with a bunch of guys 

576.17 579.23 B: the guys would all be into that kind of humor you know 

578.56 580.34 A: right [laughter] exactly 

579.53 580.93 B: [laughter]
