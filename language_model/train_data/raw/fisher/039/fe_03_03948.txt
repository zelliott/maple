0.32 4.32 B: hi my name's kenter roberts i'm from california 

3.43 7.74 A: ah my name is matthew and i'm from ah wisconsin 

8.36 9.19 B: (( hm )) 

9.73 11.65 A: um i'm from wisconsin 

11.25 12.32 B: oh 

12.97 14.20 B: [noise] um 

14.65 15.92 B: okay so 

16.21 17.90 B: about the topic 

18.13 21.42 B: what would you think would be ah comedy in bad taste 

22.11 26.31 A: ah comedy in bad taste i think depends more on 

26.52 36.74 A: ah i think it's more dynamic than just like a black and white bad taste or good taste it depends mostly on the situation i think like they're not going to talk about something ah 

32.62 34.31 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

37.15 44.13 A: you know sexually humor round your grandparents or something but you know if you're with ah some of your friends maybe that's acceptable 

43.87 45.65 B: mhm 

45.60 46.62 A: (( how about you )) 

48.20 54.23 B: how about me well i guess most people will not argue that it depends on the situation 

54.37 57.38 B: whether ah what kind of people you're with ah 

57.66 68.50 B: maybe there's i keep thinking movies when they say comedy that's in bad humor but ah you know like maybe there's a particularly bad scene that was meant to be comical but it's not 

69.00 69.87 A: that's 

69.04 70.59 B: something like that 

70.18 83.99 A: yeah that's true ah i rem- ah quite a few movies like that i mean the movie's just so bad that it's funny or just something is off beat not meant to be you can't help but laugh at it 

80.30 82.59 B: mhm 

83.64 97.39 B: mhm i've been reading some comedies i don't think they were meant to be funny they were supposed to be like literary works serious works but what they do is it's absurdity that's how they do a lot of their comi- 

97.24 105.40 B: comic that's how they do the comic effect so i guess in some cases comedy about like a bad situation will be 

106.20 109.13 B: would be acceptable because it's not 

109.37 111.44 B: if it's maybe it's not intended to 

111.54 113.80 B: be targeted at a particular 

114.24 116.57 B: kind of ah individual 

117.04 118.62 B: (( like [cough] )) 

118.78 120.71 B: okay well here's another example 

121.48 126.94 B: it's not too it's not it's in bad taste to make racial jokes about another race 

127.65 133.26 B: but it's a se- but it most people think it's a sensible to make jokes about your own 

127.82 129.05 A: mhm 

133.50 134.77 A: that's very true 

136.08 137.23 A: that's ah 

136.75 137.31 B: (( [mn] )) 

137.89 144.79 A: yeah i guess that's not that's definitely not situational it's definitely ah like i the situation is it depends on what race you are [laughter] 

144.50 147.41 B: yeah and who you're talking to 

148.40 161.63 A: the absurdity thing is interesting that that's definitely a form of humor i think there's just so many different ah ways you can go about it it's just really depends on what the ah topic is but a- i feel there are some i mean 

155.37 157.15 B: (( mhm )) 

162.26 168.38 A: some absolute lines to cross i mean racial humor that's not intended to be um 

168.97 171.84 A: just a joke more something that's um 

173.23 178.18 A: i don't how it how it b- something that something's going to be made with um 

178.99 181.04 A: i guess malicious intent 

179.48 182.36 B: (( mhm )) 

181.12 184.04 A: is definitely not go- it's going to be ah across the line 

184.93 195.13 B: that reminds me i remember seeing a lot of ah old films of you know old cartoons and stuff of with a really strange depiction of african americans 

195.81 198.47 A: oh yeah i remember 

197.53 199.42 B: all of them were 

199.54 201.06 B: obese or 

201.92 204.60 B: obese with extremely large lips 

205.01 215.85 B: which is not correct but that's very strange i don't know if it was meant for comic effect or it just simply racist but i think it was supposed to be comic 

216.11 223.43 B: and maybe at the time it might have been comical depending on the person watching it but most people aren't too 

223.86 225.77 B: thrilled with that kind of thing right now 

226.04 230.80 A: even even in world war two if you look up some of the old ah warner brothers cartoons 

230.58 232.94 B: of the japanese oh yeah 

231.43 236.39 A: yeah they got bugs bunny and bugs nips the nips and things like that 

235.13 237.67 B: i saw that film i 

236.78 241.42 A: it just u- unbelievable but i guess [mn] i don't know if that's 

240.74 245.32 B: at that time the there was probably some great big hatred at that point 

244.71 247.85 A: yeah but even even then like i guess 

248.69 256.39 A: you you see a lot [mn] with all the stuff going on in the middle east right now you see a lot of a lot of humor from all that area but i don't see anything by a main 

256.79 262.38 A: mainstream media to that you know to that that ah that much um 

258.34 259.40 B: mhm 

262.85 264.63 B: (( yeah )) 

262.94 271.71 A: where you'd actually produce a cartoon about it i mean i there's there's funny ah jokes and you know altered pictures and stuff floating around but um 

267.47 269.26 B: (( yeah )) 

270.53 271.86 B: mhm 

272.24 276.47 A: make light of the situation but nothing that outright 

277.15 283.38 B: [mn] and to the around that kind of humor i guess it depends on what what the target is who the target is 

283.48 288.27 B: like i've seen a lot of ah joke pictures on saddam 

288.69 293.22 B: and most people don't consider it as extremely demoralizing but if 

288.78 290.08 A: mhm 

293.24 298.22 B: somebody had a picture of let's say an afghani person just a general generic one 

297.82 299.08 A: mhm 

298.41 301.31 B: with a lot of stereotypes applied to it within the joke 

301.53 302.53 B: (( that'll be )) 

303.01 305.56 B: that'll be a hundred times more insulting 

306.06 308.87 B: although it was meant for comic effect 

308.80 310.10 A: that's very true 

310.90 319.96 A: although e- even then like it's going to be situational like i- it might be funny over here to people but i'm sure it's not funny if you're you know 

319.77 320.83 B: afghani 

320.46 333.00 A: afghani or you're in the e- even in the region i mean i- i'm sure [mn] i think i all humor is some it's somewhat like that though all humor takes aim at someone or something i mean 

329.80 331.53 B: yeah 

332.72 334.39 B: wo- won't like it mhm 

333.02 334.10 A: it's almost im- 

334.15 340.05 A: yeah it's almost impossible not to try to insult or not to ah insult something or in some way 

340.40 343.05 A: but i mean i we write it off as humor [laughter] 

340.53 341.33 B: (( a )) 

343.02 348.93 B: lot of the stand up comics tend to rely on that kind of thing they target people or 

349.00 350.83 B: or types of people 

350.74 359.54 A: mhm or even even like like you say like the absurdity of ah the situation i've been i w- i watched seinfeld and like ah a little bit of 

359.68 365.22 A: the the standard what is the deal with you know and fill in the blank there 

365.50 367.30 B: mhm 

366.03 374.45 A: what is the deal with airplane peanuts or you know just anything along the same line it's just something pointing out the obvious and then making making light of it 

374.03 375.39 B: mhm 

376.25 384.49 B: yeah and the other way comic effect is produced is maybe ch- making working into a viewpoint that you've never seen before 

384.99 388.61 B: that's so out there that it makes it funny 

388.25 397.66 A: that definitely that definitely st- rings true and that's that's along the same lines as the ah absurdity type thing i mean something you'd never never look at it in a certain way 

392.25 393.98 B: yeah 

394.54 395.94 B: yeah that's true 

399.18 404.80 A: it's just it's interesting too it it goes across like ah class levels too like something that's not 

399.53 401.22 B: so mhm 

404.87 415.56 A: ah [mn] jokes you know if you're a teenager or something or beavis and butthead might have been funny or [laughter] you know and as you move up and stuff gets you consider things stupid and not funny 

414.23 416.83 B: mhm 

417.59 419.36 B: yeah so 

420.09 428.16 B: um with all these variables in it seems like you know jokes could be funny for people of a different age group people of a different race gender 

428.58 429.63 B: hair color 

429.76 431.41 A: mhm 

430.87 437.87 B: oh no music genres it seems like just about every every facet of society 

438.43 443.94 B: has an effect on the comic the comedy ah i mean has an effect on someone's comic tastes 

444.91 447.20 B: would that would that be something that could be 

447.90 449.10 B: arguable 

449.64 455.55 A: i think i think that's definitely ah i i think that's definitely true i mean in my in my opinion it's like 

455.89 466.87 A: every even even different countries like look at the french love ah jerry lewis and [laughter] now i don't i don't know many people in america that say oh yeah we rented that you know 

466.89 468.68 B: mhm 

467.25 471.80 A: jerry lewis film or something but i- if yeah it's just yeah it definitely goes 

472.03 473.42 A: every ah yeah 

472.04 473.70 B: or even culture now 

473.52 478.48 A: every level of different ah differences between people are just 

477.65 481.66 B: have you seen i- have you seen or heard british humor before 

482.09 489.73 A: with a lot of the um um dressing up as women males dressing up as women like the monty python type type stuff 

488.79 491.35 B: yeah monty python kind of thing that's 

492.67 497.42 B: [cough] that's kind of interesting it it's probably cultural more than anything else in that case 

497.16 504.87 A: mhm like their cross dressing is a a huge ah tool for humor and sketch comedy 

501.21 501.98 B: well 

503.37 506.11 B: mhm 

505.08 508.81 A: even even in canada like what if you've ever seen like the kids in the hall 

509.38 516.45 A: they use a lot of a lot of ah cross dressing i i suppose saturday live does too but it's usually more ah outrageous 

515.93 517.74 B: mhm 

517.28 518.74 A: like seeing ah 

519.29 525.63 A: i don't know wilfrid ower or tracey morgan or someone dressed up as a woman is just ridiculous 

524.11 525.87 B: yeah 

526.81 531.80 A: but n- none of that strikes me as inappropriate i mean i don't think anyone women 

530.09 531.04 B: no 

531.98 533.76 A: i'm sure are when 

534.03 538.94 A: wilfrid ower's playing janet reno i'm sure she's not pleased about it and she doesn't think it's appropriate 

537.78 547.83 B: she's probably not satisfied but [mn] she can't do anything that's probably not such a mentally traumatizing even that she's scarred for life 

547.16 549.24 A: yeah exactly 

548.79 552.38 B: and i guess you could say that you know women aren't insulted to see men dressed as 

553.04 562.68 B: women and imitating slightly maybe may maybe at worst annoyed but they wouldn't find it as i mean it wouldn't s- seen shown as 

564.01 565.81 B: racially i mean ah 

565.39 566.07 A: (( [noise] )) 

566.09 567.95 B: as a gender attack 

567.55 576.82 A: yeah i i think that almost almost everything like that is um d- generally people don't take a great offence to it i mean 

569.01 569.57 B: (( [mn] )) 

569.72 571.27 B: yeah 

576.83 580.76 A: people don't take gr- great offence when ah 

581.59 584.66 A: yeah people dress up as women or you know 

585.00 590.44 A: just th- different you know the very the very young or playing the very old or just stuff stuff like that 

589.45 591.99 B: mhm 

593.09 599.89 B: that reminds me of another kind of comedy that i thought from a commercial was a boost mobile cellular phone commercial
