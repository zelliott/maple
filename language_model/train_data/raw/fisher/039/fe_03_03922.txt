16.18 18.43 A: funny and something that's unacceptable

43.49 45.68 B: (( thrown at you you )) 

47.04 51.32 B: (( can walk out [laughter] you know that kind of kind of talk is big trash [mn] but it- it's )) 

50.79 51.82 A: mhm 

51.29 63.49 B: ((  )) 

53.10 54.36 A: mhm 

57.15 58.09 A: right 

63.78 65.11 B: (( you could just say )) 

66.11 71.84 B: (( if something like that is presented and you think it is vulgar you can just say well )) 

66.44 67.34 A: well 

68.19 69.19 A: yeah 

71.88 81.24 B: (( that sounds vulgar to me [mn] and um you don't really appreciate that kind of humor but how about what happens to the )) 

79.65 80.78 A: (( right )) 

81.65 92.24 A: i also think it depends on the individual person i guess 'cause i mean what what one person might think is vulgar might be what some other person thinks is funny or some other person might think is acceptable right 

90.73 91.60 B: (( situation )) 

91.83 92.87 B: (( where it's )) 

93.37 97.24 B: (( not another person maybe if you see )) 

97.72 102.77 B: (( something on television that you think is vulgar i mean how do you think you should respond to )) 

102.82 103.71 A: right 

103.39 104.58 B: (( that )) 

104.69 107.96 B: (( [mn] )) 

106.83 107.84 A: mhm 

115.70 117.30 A: (( mhm )) 

118.17 124.05 B: how how should a [mn] i just turn the television station off i just don't listen to those kinds of programs [mn] 

120.44 122.11 A: [laughter] 

122.70 124.00 A: right right 

124.88 127.55 B: you know there are types who like jerry springer 

127.24 128.17 A: mhm 

127.81 132.25 B: and there are a lot of people who enjoy that well i don't so i don't listen to it i 

131.74 132.59 A: mhm 

132.70 137.84 B: and of course they're not ah they're not finding out what i like so what can i say 

137.32 138.97 A: mhm right 

138.07 143.19 B: i mean they they have they make up these reports you know on who watches what 

142.89 143.78 A: right 

143.33 146.93 B: [laughter] and i haven't i'm not in that loop [laughter] so 

147.30 151.03 B: i don't know [mn] how they get their statistics 

150.69 151.74 A: mhm 

152.15 158.26 A: and also i think that like another component of something that's unacceptable might not necessarily just be something that's vulgar 

158.04 169.61 A: i think maybe like that something that's offensive in terms of like making like racial stereotypes or like like disparaging remarks about like gays or homosexuals as well would be rather insulting as well and rather unacceptable 

163.03 164.12 B: yes 

169.02 170.06 B: (( right [mn] )) 

170.66 175.94 B: well i avoid people like that in general i mean i don't i don't encourage 'em [mn] 

172.57 174.26 A: mhm mhm right 

175.89 176.78 A: right 

177.92 186.62 A: um let's see well then so some people you do agree that some people like think that stuff like that is funny and making jokes about that kind of thing is funny though yeah 

184.82 186.13 B: [mn] oh yeah 

186.34 198.28 B: i mean um [mn] the statistics show that that you that the truth about the population in the united states is forty per cent of you know 

198.29 202.83 B: follow the rules and they're moderate in their behaviour and ah they're more or less 

203.20 204.40 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

205.46 213.79 B: doing you know intellectual things or more academic than the rest so sixty percent we have to deal with 

208.79 209.71 A: mhm 

211.65 212.49 A: mhm 

213.38 215.10 A: right right yeah 

214.63 215.83 B: [laughter] 

216.74 218.40 B: and what can you do 

218.11 220.87 A: yeah i know so yeah that's a real problem 

218.43 228.82 B: so [laughter] it's unf- there are forty percent that are intellectual and enjoy the fine things in life like like shakespeare and poetry and [mn] and the wonderful um 

226.25 227.43 A: mhm mhm 

229.26 236.91 B: compositions that have been written years ago [mn] in music [mn] they're that's it it's forty percent so 

235.34 237.40 A: mhm right right 

237.29 240.39 B: and i don't think those statistics have changed 

239.74 241.24 A: right yeah 

240.55 241.57 B: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

241.25 249.45 A: do you think though it it might be like a situation where like standards differ like maybe like in the past certain things would be offensive and then gradually over time it changes 

250.20 251.66 B: what'd you say [mn] 

251.05 258.41 A: i said like maybe certain things change over time like what we might think is offensive now other people might not think is offensive [mn] in the future 

258.93 260.28 B: oh i don't know 

259.91 261.04 A: mhm 

261.61 262.65 B: (( but ah )) 

263.09 264.01 A: right 

263.68 276.57 B: i i just know that ah we have ah people in congress like this senator from ah pennsylvania i couldn't believe it or is he a congressman anyway [mn] he wants to the supreme court to make a law 

270.37 271.34 A: mhm 

277.54 284.33 B: [lipsmack] against certain types of behaviour and you cannot legislate that kind of thing 

283.85 285.24 A: right right 

284.41 286.34 B: that's just ridiculous 

285.82 287.13 A: mhm 

286.40 289.21 B: who's gonna be watching [laughter] i mean 

288.19 289.09 A: right 

289.41 291.50 A: but like i mean a lot of pe- 

290.56 294.92 B: and so the supreme court with this particular ma- ah 

292.38 293.84 A: mhm 

294.95 307.10 B: case that they're deciding now i think they're gonna have to say this is up to the individual and we cannot we can't make a law and because that is affecting somebody's privacy 

301.19 302.96 A: right yeah 

306.51 318.83 A: mhm mhm but like i mean if a lot of people think that what a person says is like even though person thinks it's funny or it's like particularly humorous if a lot of people like take offence to it then should we be able to like regulate what he says then 

318.65 319.65 B: no 

319.30 320.60 A: mhm 

319.92 324.01 B: never that you cannot censor what people will say 

323.48 325.44 A: right mhm 

324.06 329.08 B: we have to not necessarily accept it but we have to tolerate [mn] 

328.34 329.37 A: [noise] 

329.55 331.77 B: we have to tolerate all speech 

331.83 346.20 A: but like at the same time though i mean those sorts of situations where we don't really want children to be ex- exposed to that say like vulgar sit- vulgar or like offensive material and like if it's in a form where like children can get hold of it like maybe newspapers or so on shouldn't we still censor it then 

347.20 352.61 B: [mn] well i think that um i think that for children you can only restrict them so far 

352.17 353.25 A: right 

352.81 357.92 B: and i think that you have to um be ah be certain or at least try 

354.16 356.30 A: (( mhm )) 

357.50 359.28 A: mhm 

358.04 359.68 B: to manage 

359.88 364.17 B: to see that the child has acceptable people as friends 

363.67 364.84 A: right right 

364.36 368.76 B: and is with acceptable people and you have to know what they're doing 

368.60 370.28 A: (( ahah ahah right )) 

369.51 375.18 B: [mn] and ah i'm i was real proud of my children because [mn] they knew ah ah 

375.16 384.74 B: when they went out what was acceptable to them and if they didn't like it then they moved they moved on they had they had a choice they could either stay or 

378.41 379.37 A: mhm 

385.17 387.36 B: or walk home if necessary 

387.15 394.55 A: so i guess the really important thing is how the individual deals with it i mean if the individual isn't like mature enough to deal with it then there's no way you can actually make a difference 

394.45 395.41 B: what 

395.09 399.24 A: then it just depends on on the individual because if the individual yeah 

397.56 398.67 B: right 

399.15 405.03 B: and you well you have to know you know you have to know what kind of people your child is associating with 

400.74 402.04 A: mhm 

404.63 405.69 A: right 

405.46 414.17 B: and ah it's true you can't ah measure everything but you but on the other hand if you ah if they have a sense of what your values are 

414.58 417.73 B: [mn] ah they will ah usually abide by those 

417.18 425.09 A: right right yeah so i guess it's a matter of making it clear to other people what your standards are and what kind of things that you would tolerate and what you wouldn't 

424.32 425.38 B: (( right [mn] )) 

425.38 427.29 A: right mhm 

428.00 430.05 A: ah so [mn] 

430.19 431.26 A: let's see 

431.51 432.86 A: um 

433.45 434.01 A: (( [mn] )) 

435.42 439.35 A: well lets just supposed to talk about the issue of comedy a little bit longer i think 

439.33 448.23 B: oh how long oh we have to talk some more well what do you think [mn] so ah w- well some of this um ah 

441.66 442.84 A: yeah 

448.29 454.47 B: i don't know i i think that possibly ah people get used to what they hear 

454.15 455.83 A: mhm 

454.77 458.48 B: and um and you know even though [mn] 

457.38 458.65 A: mhm 

458.91 463.79 B: even though it might be offensive to some people they s- they still might get a kick out of it or 

463.29 465.00 A: right right 

463.87 467.90 B: and ah so i don't see anything wrong with that because if the person's 

467.92 474.31 B: if the person's taste is that low or whatever well fine and i mean that's not going to cause any harm 

469.58 470.31 A: [noise] 

473.79 474.95 A: right 

474.76 482.89 B: and i don't think um [mn] and i don't think ah censorship is the way to go at all i mean you know in the past they 

483.08 484.99 B: they banned books that had 

485.06 487.78 B: strong sexual overtones and [lipsmack] 

487.01 488.44 A: mhm 

488.37 496.67 B: like chatterley's lover and a lot of other books that they banned [mn] and ah i don't think that those books can hurt a person [mn] 

492.28 493.46 A: right 

496.09 504.03 A: how about like like comedy where they actually try to like you know make like racial stereotypes or say disparaging things about other kinds of people 

499.85 500.55 B: like 

503.82 505.31 B: like what 

504.58 513.30 A: like maybe like um like comedies that actually try to make disparaging remarks about like races or like perhaps like you know sexual orientation 

510.65 520.42 B: oh well i think you know since we have this policy now more or less of political correctness we don't see that kind of thing often very much now [mn] 

514.76 516.10 A: mhm 

517.71 519.06 A: right right 

520.53 523.16 B: and i don't know whether that's a good thing or a bad thing 

522.68 523.75 A: mhm 

523.73 527.34 B: because ah in the past ah you know people could 

527.40 531.79 B: ah see themselves i mean you have to see yourself as others see you 

531.97 533.96 A: (( well i mean how could it )) 

533.00 540.17 B: and um people can see themselves and accept that as a joke and just move on from there 

537.94 539.53 A: mhm 

539.74 544.23 A: well but i guess some people feel that the jokes that people other people make are 

544.53 552.17 A: not necessarily in good humor and are actually meant to maliciously hurt the person or perpetuate a kind of like false image of the person 

552.12 553.28 B: yeah 

554.78 558.36 B: well it depend- i think it depends on ah what is said 

558.21 559.21 A: mhm 

558.99 563.99 B: but i i certainly don't i i feel that in polite society we need to be tolerant 

563.49 564.80 A: right 

564.21 567.16 B: and we need to ah listen to people 

567.49 570.43 B: [mn] and ah we also need to um 

570.48 574.34 B: just tell them if they are offensive that they are 

574.03 586.66 A: mhm but like isn't it hard to draw the line sometimes i mean some situations are where it seems funny but at the same time let's say like a group could be like offended by it because it is very stereotypical and so forth 

584.90 585.97 B: yeah 

586.09 586.84 B: (( ahah )) 

587.15 594.62 B: well i don't i don't go to any groups like that so i [laughter] i can't tell you i- i'm choosy to begin with 

594.28 595.49 A: right 

595.22 598.49 B: [laughter] so [mn] the people i associate with are 

598.53 599.89 B: (( are not mak- ))
