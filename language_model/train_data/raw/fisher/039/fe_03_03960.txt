117.66 123.05 B: i kind of tend to well i'm k- i don't know in some ways my values are kind of old fashioned [laughter] so ah 

123.12 132.36 B: i like stuff like maybe very clean very clean and very i guess very i don't know they're that the com- the comedian has to be very good

132.65 133.89 B: what's that mm 

133.34 140.06 A: i i kinda like some of the slapstick stuff like i like some of the stuff from years ago although you never see it anymore 

140.11 151.02 A: ah with comedians like um red skelton and and people like that that were funny but didn't [mn] they kind of more poked fun at themselves as opposed to 

151.05 152.46 A: other people 

153.48 154.44 A: [mn] but 

153.67 154.93 B: yeah

184.54 193.60 A: ah actually i must say that none of them i i watch although bob hope i probably might have seen some of his stuff years ago but the other two ah 

193.76 197.44 A: yeah i guess i'm [mn] i'm into really into theirs 

198.03 205.14 A: i guess actually here where i live um sometimes i've watched well sometimes i watched 

205.33 208.81 A: um comedy which is based more 

208.90 216.42 A: on political kind of poking fun at some of the politicians and some of the stuff is good but sometimes they go a little bit too far as well 

217.69 220.64 A: but it's kind of interesting sometimes 

221.21 223.51 B: mm yeah i think 

222.70 224.48 A: whereabouts do you live

241.42 242.03 A: (( so )) 

242.42 246.97 B: hm i wonder if you can i guess you probably get different shows different kind of humor 

242.66 243.85 A: yeah so 

246.82 252.77 A: well we actually get a lot of american shows [laughter] which can be good or bad [laughter] 

249.67 250.90 B: oh really 

251.68 252.63 B: [laughter] 

252.86 255.64 A: [mn] but ah yeah 

255.47 260.57 B: yeah i noticed like a lot of co- like a lot of ah comedy here like especially these days 

260.61 262.54 B: is really geared to 

262.94 275.80 B: how can i put it almost like a street humor [laughter] or like i don't know it's like a it's it's kind of dirty and is is really offensive [laughter] and that's like the way it's going [laughter] 

275.28 285.06 A: oh yeah well i i believe that yeah [mn] [sigh] yeah that's right that's that's why i i don't tend to watch a lot of comedy on t._v. because ah 

285.57 289.78 A: there's just not an awful lot to see [laughter] [mn] 

288.16 294.90 B: yeah the i think the even the comedians today they don't have what the older comedians from years back 

294.91 297.44 B: like before somehow they they can make 

297.65 302.11 B: i don't know they can just like their co- their humor is so different because they just m- 

302.31 306.71 B: make things a a funny way but not insult anybody 

306.55 307.97 A: mhm 

307.20 313.07 B: yeah one of my favorite comedians has got to be roge- oh what's his name rodney dangerfield i 

312.25 313.06 A: (( hm )) 

313.08 315.16 B: don't know if you've ever heard anything by him 

314.46 319.52 A: oh i've heard of him yeah but i can't say i've actually seen him in action [mn] 

318.50 320.51 B: yeah i mean he has um 

321.09 332.35 B: it's just like his timing's really good i mean he has some like dirty stuff but ah a lot of his stuff is just like everyday events but he kinda puts it in a certain way which makes you laugh [laughter] which is think's kinda neat [laughter] 

330.30 331.75 A: mhm 

333.03 338.97 B: but i've also been to like some rare but i went to like comedy clubs out here 

338.68 339.89 A: mhm 

339.17 345.97 B: and the up and coming young comedians they are horrible [laughter] so 

343.11 344.36 A: mhm 

344.95 354.95 A: oh i can believe that yeah that's why i don't think i would go to many of these comedy clubs either because [mn] some of the stuff can be good and others can just be 

355.01 356.91 A: just tasteless [laughter] 

356.17 357.29 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

358.56 370.92 B: it's funny i just notice like ah the co- the comedians these days is they have nothing to say really or they'll just say dirty words [laughter] talk about sex insult people 

370.61 373.45 A: [mn] well that's probably because they don't have an awful lot ah 

373.52 376.67 A: not much of a repertoire probably [laughter] 

375.95 378.14 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

377.48 383.83 A: so they have to fill up their routines 'cause they think that that people are going to like it m- maybe some people do but ah it 

383.86 386.27 A: doesn't really say much about their audience 

386.21 389.07 B: it's amazing i find like a lot of 

389.10 395.75 B: there's a lot of people that like that kind of humor [laughter] i don't know if it's humor to me it's not even humor just 

395.80 405.02 B: when like ah somebody cusses or insults somebody else or something like that there's a lot of people just laugh i don't know if they're programmed or whatever [laughter] but they laugh 

401.37 402.70 A: mhm 

404.84 409.06 A: well i guess that means th- that ah we know where their minds are [laughter] 

409.27 410.69 B: (( yes [laughter] )) 

409.54 410.96 A: (( [laughter] )) 

411.22 424.16 A: [mn] yeah i've been in to california a few times um we wer- we were there in two thousands but ah yeah i can't say i don't go down there so much for ah [mn] 

412.56 413.32 B: (( mm )) 

424.15 436.68 A: for comedy and stuff like that but ah yeah but i've liked being down there mhm [lipsmack] there's a lot of nice nice towns and stuff along the way down the coast too i like going down there 

430.22 431.57 B: mhm 

436.60 442.22 B: yeah it's an interesting place [laughter] there's a lot of different things [laughter] out here 

438.55 439.82 A: mhm 

441.89 444.10 A: (( mhm [mn] yup )) 

445.93 447.46 B: (( hm wow )) 

447.46 448.23 A: (( [mn] )) 

449.81 456.89 B: it's interesting i never h- of all these phone calls so far this is my third one i haven't ah 

455.01 458.42 A: mhm what kind of things have you discussed 

458.38 462.72 B: (( ah one was ah what did you think about the disarming of iraq and )) 

461.92 465.00 A: oh huh that must've been interesting [laughter] 

462.92 463.74 B: (( another )) 

464.51 474.22 B: well it was okay i guess i forgot what the other one was but it's i never had someone that's really like total adversary or [laughter] 

473.84 475.03 A: mhm 

475.18 476.02 B: oh 

475.26 476.12 A: (( [mn] hm )) 

476.23 480.62 B: yeah the other one talked about was like raising of the minimum wage [laughter] 

479.96 481.35 A: oh yeah 

480.97 485.93 B: yeah but i haven't got anybody that's really on the opposite side that's [mn] [laughter] ha 

485.81 489.15 A: oh well actually i talked with somebody about that yesterday 

489.41 495.12 A: i actually j- i i didn't know that it was a federal um [mn] 

494.91 508.86 A: type of thing i because here it's provincial so i think you know every every province has it's own um [mn] minimum wage so i didn't realize that in the u._s. that it would be the same right across 

509.21 513.92 A: the u._s. which doesn't seem like a very good way of doing it 

515.34 522.30 B: hm that's interesting [laughter] i really wouldn't know about the way [laughter] but that's interesting 

521.86 533.83 A: mhm [mn] yeah well i guess i'm i'm just not used to it just being you know federally dictated i don't i don't think that's a good way of doing it because every state and every province [mn] 

533.71 537.27 A: may not have exactly the same standard of living so 

537.42 538.90 A: to put it um 

539.22 543.51 A: [mn] just basically across the board i don't think that's probably 

543.80 552.17 A: the most effective way of of ah dealing with minimum wage but i guess that's the way it is down in the states [mn] [mn] 

549.55 550.53 B: yeah 

550.99 552.45 B: (( yup [laughter] )) 

553.51 555.98 B: hm what else about comedy [mn] 

557.20 558.37 B: (( hm )) 

559.68 567.59 A: as far as sitcoms go i don't watch too many of them but there are there are some that are somewhat interesting but ah [sigh] 

568.73 570.25 A: yeah 

569.96 572.58 B: do you get like a i'm sorry go ahead 

572.04 573.48 A: oh no it's okay 

573.24 580.45 B: yeah i was just wondering if you got if you if you get like british shows or you know from england or other 

580.64 590.05 A: well i i think there are some of those there are some of those around but i i don't watch too many of those well actually there although there was one there was a comedy one 

581.23 582.44 B: european 

590.00 599.95 A: that i watched years back it was actually was actually ah quite funny [mn] it was a series but i don't i don't know if it's on t._v. or not i watched actually at a friend's
