259.26 261.02 B: what are your thoughts on it 

262.13 263.32 B: (( [noise] )) 

262.86 264.08 A: well i i 

264.79 267.14 A: i think that comedy in 

264.99 265.82 B: hello 

267.70 273.05 A: comedy can be carried too far with the vulgarity i don't think that it's necessary a lot of times 

273.04 274.03 B: yeah 

273.46 281.62 A: and it makes it difficult if i'm watching a movie with my kids but it doesn't offend it normally doesn't offend me or anything i just 

281.71 285.52 A: [cough] i don't wanna you know and even with my sixteen year old i let him watch 

281.86 282.42 B: (( [mn] )) 

285.46 286.23 B: oh 

286.15 288.73 A: more than i probably should 

288.83 292.49 A: but i try to watch it w- i have a three year old too i try to watch it with her 

293.00 300.09 B: 'cause i know my mom [mn] my mom when we younger 'cause i'm nineteen now but when we couldn't see like the you know 

300.83 310.36 B: the p._g. thirteen movies you know that were older for us i mean older for children to watch she would like censor it for us she would watch the movies first and then she would you know 

310.02 311.16 A: yeah 

310.38 315.46 B: say whether or not it was okay for us to watch so we weren't allowed to watch rated r. movies 

315.83 317.17 B: not at all 

317.18 319.38 A: i wasn't either when i was growing up 

319.52 320.17 B: (( [laughter] )) 

319.71 324.84 A: even television shows when i was growing up some of 'em i couldn't watch [laughter] 

323.35 325.98 B: (( yeah i some things and )) 

325.26 327.00 A: [laughter] 

326.17 327.14 B: i 

327.33 333.18 B: the censor is funny to me some things are necessary but i think that if you 

333.51 341.68 B: [mn] other countries it's like you know drinking some people think that you know people shouldn't drink i don't agree with you know young people drinking 

342.33 343.68 B: because you know 

343.85 352.85 B: i don't think it's right but in other countries yeah in other countries they drink on a daily basis that's a part of their culture 

345.15 347.29 A: right they're not responsible 

350.90 352.04 A: right 

353.61 363.35 B: so i don't know i mean [mn] as far as vulgarity is concerned i don't think that little children should be watching i mean if you're eighteen or older 

363.34 369.28 B: then that's fine if that's what you wanna do because you're an adult but for younger children 

369.51 376.16 B: no 'cause i couldn't see my little sister my either one of my little sisters i mean the nine year old and the 

376.19 381.94 B: two two year old i couldn't wa- sit down and watch them you know looking at something like that 

382.74 384.89 A: yeah i'd be it's hard for me to 

385.26 386.30 B: yeah 

386.28 388.50 A: to see that with my kids 

388.87 391.35 B: (( yeah i always remember )) 

391.39 394.99 B: i did not understand why my parents wouldn't let me watch certain things 

394.16 396.17 A: [laughter] me either 

395.09 396.53 B: i really couldn't 

396.26 397.43 A: [laughter] 

396.68 401.46 B: my friends would come to school yeah i watched blah blah blah blah blah and i'm like well [mn] 

401.50 402.85 B: i was studying 

402.59 404.17 A: [laughter] 

403.62 405.16 B: or i was watching something 

407.04 409.08 A: i guess the same thing 

407.24 408.06 B: but 

409.70 411.80 B: but when you think about it it make- 

412.80 420.47 B: you know you know that when you were younger if your mom told you not to do something you probably did it anyway behind her back 

418.91 422.62 A: oh most of the time that's exactly right [laughter] 

421.86 423.55 B: yeah so um 

424.11 430.99 B: i don't know wh- when you censor things it makes children want to you know it makes them gravitate to it more 

427.91 428.84 A: makes them 

430.68 433.67 A: more curious yeah that's very true 

431.96 436.76 B: yeah 'cause they're like okay what does mom want to try to hide from me it 

435.76 437.41 A: [laughter] 

437.20 439.21 B: must be something we 

439.00 440.97 A: and you know i could go over to my 

439.47 441.25 B: (( may as well check it out )) 

440.98 451.24 A: i could go over to my friends' house and watch it at their house because their parents would allow it you know [laughter] so just out of curiosity i'd you know go to the neighbor go to my friend's house 

444.12 445.25 B: yeah 

450.60 451.36 B: yeah 

451.26 455.04 A: they could do that a lot to get away with stuff actually 

455.18 456.73 B: (( [mn] )) 

457.13 461.57 B: i can't watch my friends knew because they knew how my mom was 

461.69 462.92 A: i try to 

464.35 470.82 B: (( but that i thought was appropriate something is appropriate now like if someone's cursing like )) 

476.80 477.90 B: at all 

482.24 483.34 A: so do you 

483.84 489.92 A: i don't know do you have any limits that you'll turn something off if it's offen- you know does a- anything offend you or 

489.99 492.03 B: [noise] does anything offend me 

490.51 494.95 A: as far as language vulgarity or certain things that you just don't think 

495.45 500.52 B: okay the things that offend me will mostly with comedy 

500.65 502.33 B: i like watching 

503.53 505.81 B: (( you know but sometimes )) 

507.05 507.98 B: um 

507.17 508.29 A: right 

508.74 509.95 B: (( [cough] )) 

524.93 527.18 B: sex objects and they act like 

528.35 530.49 B: so i can be offended 

531.18 536.99 B: i can get upset when the males say it because a lot of the women don't care about themselves 

537.10 538.22 A: right 

538.99 544.02 B: and then you have the female comics who come on and they're putting themselves down 

544.41 545.35 A: yeah 

544.52 552.70 B: so it's like how do i look up to you when you're basically saying i'm nothing but a sex object and that 

553.46 555.09 B: that's what i should be doing 

555.71 557.55 A: that's very true [mn] 

558.19 559.65 A: [noise] that's very true 

558.94 560.93 B: (( i mean don't get me wrong )) 

561.51 562.93 B: (( they are funny )) 

563.08 567.77 B: and i'll laugh at it but some things i'm like okay that's a little too much 

564.73 565.57 A: right 

567.08 568.87 A: [laughter] 

568.06 570.28 B: (( i don't know about all that )) 

570.83 571.76 B: but 

570.85 573.01 A: i gotta agree with you there 

573.34 575.34 B: yeah 

575.80 579.83 B: (( i know i know our momma [mn] has a lot to say on the subject )) 

579.52 581.01 A: really [laughter]

588.02 589.29 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

588.55 589.81 B: (( but i don't know )) 

590.49 592.59 B: a lot of things are getting 

593.14 594.67 B: out of hand 

595.10 596.38 A: (( yeah [noise] ))
