15.74 18.70 A: yes it was it's so funny um 

17.49 18.69 B: huh 

20.21 21.88 A: basically i 

22.06 25.74 A: um on that comedies when they 

25.79 27.79 A: hit religion or 

28.01 30.98 A: you know race or anything like that 

32.00 34.09 B: (( [noise] um [sigh] )) 

34.87 36.42 B: i guess i'm 

36.81 43.35 B: i'm a little bit more i don't know i guess i might say liberal you know when it comes to comedy in that 

43.47 47.72 B: if i- you know if it's done i guess 

48.36 49.40 B: (( oh )) 

49.76 53.68 B: [sigh] i don't know it's it depending on the audience 

54.09 64.61 B: um [lipsmack] i just what makes me think of that is um i saw a comedian i can't remember his first name but um he p- stars wi- on a 

66.02 67.90 B: have you seen that yet 

67.21 68.62 A: no i haven't 

68.25 71.81 B: okay okay well he he is a black comedian 

69.41 70.55 A: [laughter] 

71.86 74.18 B: and he 

74.21 77.29 B: (( a- most of his material is )) 

77.59 82.05 B: you know it's it's der- it's derogatory towards blacks 

81.86 82.80 A: (( really )) 

82.42 89.10 B: and i guess i figure you know if he can say it and he thinks it's funny then you know 

89.30 98.61 B: okay you know and i'm okay with that and i did actually think that you know he was very funny i stayed up way later than i should have watching it but 

97.70 98.92 A: [laughter] 

98.78 108.90 B: um [mn] you know as long as it's not offensive to anybody else that's present then you know i'm pretty much okay with it you know whatever whether it be 

104.18 105.15 A: yeah 

108.85 114.90 B: you know race um religion you know if as long as it's not um 

115.47 117.00 A: upsets somebody 

116.38 125.25 B: yeah you know and it's done you know just in fun for you know whoever's there and you know whoever's there is pretty much in agreement to it but um 

125.35 135.38 B: other than that you know i don't definitely do not believe in you know telling jokes or anything that you know is meant to offend or or hurt anybody 

134.67 141.49 A: yeah yeah which a lot of them do [laughter] as far as i'm concerned a lot of them do offend somebody out there but 

141.27 151.45 B: yeah you know that's true and you know a lot of them i guess that that i might think you know are entertaining for me to hear you know i would never tell them myself 

150.84 151.71 A: yeah 

151.94 153.05 B: um 

153.67 166.67 B: [lipsmack] i don't know you know i'm not i'm not really that much into comedy i know i like robyn williams [laughter] but i'm not really i'm not really that familiar with a whole lot of comedians it's just you know it's not something that i really kinda 

158.92 159.79 A: yeah 

166.70 170.88 B: take notice of or you know make it a point to watch [noise] 

170.07 170.89 A: yeah 

171.82 178.80 A: no i i will i'm i don't watch them i listen to them a lot 'cause you know a lot of my friends they and listen to them and 

178.88 183.53 A: and i'm always [laughter] around they're playing and i'm like okay 

180.54 181.81 B: yeah 

183.49 196.17 A: was that supposed to have been funny and they're like yeah i'm like it didn't seem funny to me [laughter] [laughter] i said actually it seemed mean [laughter] but they're like you need to lighten up i'm like okay [laughter] 

188.29 189.74 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

196.27 204.94 B: yeah i guess that's kinda how you know how i look at it is you know it it is comedy and you know it's meant to entertain people and 

205.02 214.55 B: and i guess as far as comedians go i mean as much as people pay to go and listen to them or you know if they pay to buy their c._d.s or whatever they kinda know what they're getting 

214.91 215.93 A: yeah 

215.04 223.58 B: you know they you know if somebody's going to go and you know watch a comedian or you know pay for it i think they kinda know what they're getting so 

223.10 225.64 A: they're getting into yeah because i mean 

225.98 227.18 A: basically 

227.96 233.45 A: most jokes are are at the butt of somebody else there's extents so 

231.00 232.12 B: yeah 

234.51 238.40 A: i don't know [laughter] i just don't agree with a lot of it i guess 

239.76 244.62 B: oh [sigh] let's see man this is kind of a hard topic for me to talk on 

243.79 254.81 A: i know the last time we we were wondering has the end or or did we make it to the ten minutes [laughter] 'cause we were like okay what else are we supposed to say about comedy [laughter] 

247.13 248.75 B: [laughter] 

249.34 250.75 B: [laughter] 

254.59 255.85 B: um 

257.22 258.23 B: great like 

258.35 266.41 B: you know i think like eddie murphy i think he's i like to watch him i think his movies are funny but as a comedian you know in just 

265.48 276.06 A: he's not he's no good at all [laughter] as a comedian he- he's a good actor i'm with you on that ah but as stand up comedy i think he he goes a little bit too far i think 

267.06 269.57 B: yeah stand up comedy well 

269.74 272.70 B: yeah but 

275.42 278.14 B: yeah i definitely agree 

276.14 277.33 A: (( as far as )) 

277.40 281.13 A: as far as i'm concerned [laughter] he goes just a little bit too far 

280.54 281.79 B: yeah 

281.14 282.72 A: i mean in 

282.84 296.45 A: you know i i like robin williams i think he's really funny but there are a lot of his stuff that i've heard and i'm like i can't believe he just went there [laughter] but 'cause 'cause he can go a little bit you know too far 

290.94 292.55 B: yeah yeah 

295.90 298.29 B: yeah he can be a little extreme too 

298.78 300.20 B: but um 

300.45 302.95 B: h- i do i do think he's funny and 

301.60 303.45 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

302.71 316.34 B: there were a couple that i did see i watched him i say i don't watch comedians that much and here i'm talking about i'd i have watched two probably in the last month that's more probably more than i watched probably the whole last year [laughter] but um i he i saw an hour special with him and 

310.22 311.74 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

316.12 325.32 B: yeah he did go you know go a couple places i was kinda surprised i went hm i might have been kinda em- embarrassed you know if i was like in a mixed audience or something 

324.28 325.57 A: (( yeah i know )) 

325.66 334.46 B: [laughter] so but eddie murphy he just it's like every other word is you know a cuss word with him and it's like i just i don't find that entertaining at all 

331.72 332.57 A: yeah 

333.70 340.13 A: no i don't i don't either i think they could you know do it without the cussing i mean 

339.36 341.36 B: yeah 

340.29 347.07 A: i mean 'c- 'cause they know you know little kids are watching them sometimes i mean they should understand that and 

347.19 349.36 A: try to keep it a little bit clean [laughter] 

350.15 351.24 B: yeah i'm 

351.31 355.31 B: i well i definitely don't turn it on if my kids are [laughter] around 

354.52 357.19 A: yeah i know but you know some people 

357.24 358.95 A: they play it no matter 

358.67 360.32 B: yeah that's true 

360.12 361.45 A: who's around 

362.53 364.99 B: that's true let's see [noise] 

365.22 366.88 B: i like um 

367.79 375.87 B: you know and i guess some people think ellen degeneres is kind of controversial but i i find her very entertaining i 

375.31 378.57 A: i do too i think she's funny i mean i don't 

378.62 382.35 A: you know 'cause i know she went through that big old thing 'cause you know 

382.89 383.61 A: of 

383.52 385.14 B: her coming out 

383.66 394.89 A: that her coming out and stuff and people were like oh you shouldn't and i'm like why not i mean if that's her choice that's her choice you can't make her do anything you know that's her choice 

392.70 393.86 B: yeah 

395.89 402.45 B: and i you know i think she's very entertaining in you know she doesn't you know have to get into a lot of the 

402.44 410.99 B: you know the vulgar words and [cough] you know things like that she's um i think she's just really a good all around comedian and 

407.12 408.18 A: yeah 

411.02 414.70 B: um [lipsmack] oh what's the lady that played grace 

415.03 416.52 A: oh um 

417.24 426.96 A: [lipsmack] i know who you're talking about i thought she was hilarious 'cause i mean she didn't have to use you know a lot of [noise] cussing or anything and it was clean [noise] humor 

418.73 419.70 B: yeah 

420.44 421.90 B: yeah i think she's 

426.51 427.69 B: right 

426.99 429.28 A: that's what i liked [noise] about it [noise] so 

428.18 429.62 B: yeah [noise] 

430.04 438.73 B: so if i probably had to pick i would probably lean more towards favoring female comedians just because they don't seem quite as vulgar 

431.63 433.47 A: (( [noise] )) 

435.68 438.16 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

439.00 440.09 A: [noise] um 

440.15 452.55 A: i don't know if you watch it i i did watch a s- you know that star search program they had now they had one comedian on there he i mean he didn't i don't think that he did too good but he did not cuss the whole time 

444.10 445.24 B: yeah 

452.60 464.32 A: i mean the whole time and i thought he was funny and i'm like you know what he just proves to people that you can get up there be funny and not even say a cuss word i said that just proves to people that they don't have to do that to make money 

464.05 465.33 B: right 

465.03 466.30 A: (( so i'm like if )) 

466.45 469.20 A: (( man if he can do it why can't the rest of them [laughter] )) 

468.45 478.15 B: well you know in in you know somebody you know they can be successful i think is a stand up comedian without race you know religion 

478.31 480.76 B: ah gender that type of thing but 

480.05 488.75 A: politics a lot of them do politics and i mean you know that's going to get somebody mad you know why you wanna do that [laughter] 

482.29 483.46 B: yeah 

487.88 492.65 B: but then that that's the point that makes it funnier to some people 

492.88 505.47 B: you know because um you know it does get you know digs a little deep with some people and you know they find that entertaining so i guess that's part we'd probably have a lot less comedy you know if 

505.62 508.95 B: we were that limiting to the the topics 

508.62 509.54 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

511.03 512.93 B: [noise] let's see 

512.57 514.09 A: [mn] oh 

513.84 518.49 B: but then i like lucille ball you know i think she was a good comedian [laughter] 

517.78 522.66 A: she was you know all the old time people they were funnier than that 

522.27 523.97 B: and jerry lewis
