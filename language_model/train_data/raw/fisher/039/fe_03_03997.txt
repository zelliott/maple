0.74 3.20 B: [mn] yes hello my name is joe 

3.35 5.20 A: oh hi my name's christian 

5.61 6.77 B: hi christian 

6.42 7.19 A: hi 

8.98 12.33 B: yeah the ah we supposed to start now or 

11.81 13.46 A: i guess so um 

13.64 16.74 B: (( [noise] )) 

13.80 16.82 A: i guess we're just supposed to talk about perjury for ten minutes 

16.75 25.92 B: yes yeah it said something about surgery for a loved one would you consider surgery for a loved one or something like that 

17.47 18.33 A: okay 

24.56 28.18 A: oh i thought it said perjury like would you perjure yourself 

27.61 29.10 B: oh perjure 

29.05 30.27 A: i think so 

29.24 30.47 B: oh okay 

30.41 33.17 A: that could be a different conversation [laughter] 

32.43 35.04 B: yeah different completely 

33.73 34.97 A: yeah 

35.73 39.05 B: [noise] well do you want to start okay 

37.18 38.85 A: i guess so um 

39.16 41.46 A: let's see would i commit perjury 

41.63 47.88 A: for a friend or a loved one i would say in in very rare situations um 

47.92 51.46 A: yes if my wife or close family member's 

52.55 67.37 A: safety depended on it and um i needed to protect them by perjuring myself ah in court or to a law official i would do it because they come to me before ah 

67.75 69.78 B: (( [noise] )) 

68.15 69.46 A: i guess whatever 

69.54 80.39 A: taking care of them or taking care of my wife or my family or kids would be para- ah more important to me than obeying the letter of the law in certain situations but i wouldn't do it like willy nilly for sure 

79.43 80.04 B: (( [noise] )) 

80.59 87.02 B: i agree i agree i think ah the the circumstances most often 

87.11 92.61 B: if it were a friend or loved one would dictate that i would do that that i would perjure myself if 

92.81 94.30 B: the um 

95.03 105.43 B: if the risk to them were great and ah th- of course the closer the loved one to me and the and the closer the friend to me would also factor into it how 

105.62 107.92 B: how much trouble they were in 

107.81 116.88 B: ah how how bad it was um if [mn] if i um [mn] if i believed what they had done was 

116.76 127.58 B: wrong and they really you know were guilty of it [mn] i think the severity of what they did would also have to factor into it um but and whether i thought they 

127.97 129.66 B: based on 

129.92 140.05 B: [mn] you know cir- circumstances whether i- what they did was justified because maybe for example something as ah dire as ah 

134.74 136.06 A: (( mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm mhm )) 

140.26 142.09 B: maybe they you know 

142.05 143.85 B: um killed somebody 

143.67 151.77 B: but it was like a justified justifiable homicide and if my testimony 

151.54 163.43 B: would either get them off or would convict 'em then i'd have to think real hard an- and say okay well did the- do they deserve to get off because there were 

163.49 167.74 B: mitigating circumstances maybe i- like it was aggravated 

167.85 178.46 B: ah assault maybe they were you know being raped a- for example and then the you know for example my wife is being raped and ah she turns around and kills the guy a- 

178.47 186.97 B: a- and my testimony would hinge upon whether she's gonna go to jail or not of course i'm i would perjure myself to in order to get her off 

187.24 190.57 B: but i can see myself in another circumstance 

190.58 200.78 B: [mn] where maybe not someone quite as close to me but still a say a friend in the same kind of instance but i felt as though they 

201.40 208.31 B: you know that th- th- their they th- the crime they committed whether it was murder or you know something to that effect wasn't justified then 

208.39 214.47 B: it it might be a close call it might be very difficult i'd probably have to dwell on it for a while 

213.10 215.53 A: mhm mhm yeah that's a good point because ah 

215.96 220.53 A: i mean tho- the prosecution or defense or whomever the ah 

220.79 231.11 A: offi- authorities who would call us to the stand would do it expecting that we would tell the truth it's not like they would say oh he's a relative he's just gonna get th- you know speak on the other person's behalf 

222.91 224.83 B: (( [noise] )) 

230.58 231.15 B: (( [noise] )) 

231.16 246.10 A: so there would be some obligation to to do the the right thing and and represent what the truth was but not if it's gonna send a very close loved one or friend to jail for something that they were like you said nominally guilty of 

246.55 248.87 B: [noise] right right [mn] 

247.24 255.82 A: i'm not sure how good i'd be at perjuring myself either if i were up on the stand even if i'm not i'm not a very good liar and um don't have a good poker face 

253.08 262.43 B: i agree it would be yeah it would be very tough it would be a tough tough difficult thing to do and ah tough to to be convincing 

262.26 263.09 A: mhm 

262.85 267.10 B: ah because ah by the same at the same time you would be worried 

267.20 269.64 B: that maybe they would have some um 

269.97 277.09 B: information that would ah indicate that you were perjuring yourself and now now you're in hot water 

276.81 280.46 A: that's true yeah well then potentially both are in hot water 

280.22 285.28 B: right it's a it's a really tough call it's a tough thing to do but 

285.74 292.74 B: i know that when when human emotion come you know becomes part of the factor when you 

293.19 295.77 B: you're you're talking about um 

296.04 302.94 B: loyalties and [mn] family ties and things like this it can really muddy the waters i don't ah 

303.64 305.62 B: i don't really [mn] 

305.74 315.42 B: admire well i i do admire but i don't um i feel badly a lot of times for lawyers that have to do this type of work because it can really really be tough 

315.38 322.19 A: mhm mhm yeah especially when they know when they're defending someone who they know is guilty but they have to make every argument of why they're innocent 

321.75 327.81 B: right it's their job to do it and and then they have to live with themselves if they get them off 

323.47 324.26 A: mhm 

326.79 328.20 A: mhm 

328.12 332.92 B: i guess it's a it's a great topic for discussion that's wh- i guess that's why you see so many ah 

333.15 336.17 B: popular t._v. shows ah surrounding 

336.44 345.90 B: you know le- the legal system and police and stuff like that which i happen to enjoy i like a lot of the shows like that judging amy 

338.18 339.33 A: right 

341.86 342.89 A: yeah 

346.08 347.99 B: ah where's she's a a lawyer 

348.11 352.29 B: or ah she's a judge formerly a lawyer and stuff that i i like that show 

351.86 362.10 A: mhm hm yeah 'cause it's i haven't seen it but it's probably like the others to show that um law and the legal system isn't as black and white as we often think or want it to be 

361.91 363.74 B: yep 

362.38 366.97 A: um which is where things like calling a relative to the stand often it seems like 

367.08 375.76 A: lawyers don't i guess one side won't allow it or a judge won't allow because it's either assumed that the person's just gonna say what wants to be heard and that their testimony's not as valid 

375.79 376.77 A: um 

376.92 384.59 A: but i mean eyewitness testimony [noise] isn't incredibly reliable either that if you have three eyewitnesses you'll have three different stories of what happened 

385.43 387.63 A: which is sort of a different thing but it's 

387.84 401.14 A: i don't know if i- it'd be a good question of whether a relative's testimony is more reliable than a neutral eyewitnesses' who has good intentions of telling the truth but who didn't see the truth any clearer than anybody else did 

401.72 408.66 B: right [mn] yeah it's not a perfect system but i i i think it's the best one out there 

402.75 403.64 A: (( i don't know )) 

407.94 411.56 A: mhm oh i think so too highly ah 

411.78 416.56 A: highly preferable to what goes on in a lot other parts of the world unfortunately 

416.88 418.98 B: [mn] tha- this is also true 

418.32 419.54 A: yeah 

420.57 424.68 B: yep yeah i think that um 

425.00 433.98 B: well you look at the different levels of the judicial system t- to the local courts and then you know the you when you end up getting to 

434.05 447.85 B: the county seat and then you know the the state supreme court and stuff like that working things up the channels and down the channels and [sigh] i i tell you the- i i don't i i i understand why there is so much divorce 

435.43 436.70 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

447.65 448.43 A: (( hm )) 

447.83 449.32 B: amongst lawyers 

449.23 450.11 A: oh 

450.52 451.74 A: (( hm )) 

451.15 455.38 B: 'cause it's just a it's a profession that takes up so much of their time 

454.89 455.85 A: yeah 

455.36 465.37 B: and ah they get so wrapped up in different cases and devote so much time to it that their family start life starts to become secondary in nature kind of like the way 

465.25 477.07 B: [mn] doctors are surgeons and stuff their their career just kind of takes over their whole life it's ah it's difficult 

466.94 467.87 A: mhm 

473.08 474.43 A: mhm 

475.77 478.07 A: that's true yeah and they have 

478.71 487.36 A: i guess lawyers don't ever have a thing of perjuring themselves but it seems like some defense lawyers when they're defending someone who is probably guilty or they ask 

487.46 496.13 A: they don't even want to even know the truth from the person they're defending it's just their job to defend 'em i mean that's what shows up on t._v. which who knows if it's true but um 

496.31 502.72 A: on the whole thing of whether they're up there knowingly lying or perjuring perjuring themselves which is a strange word 

502.79 503.75 A: um 

503.82 510.38 A: it seems like some of 'em you know for the they say i don't even want to know if you killed 'em i just want to know your story and i'm going to help you 

510.55 518.56 A: prove your innocence because if they knew that the person had done it it would make it harder for them to get up there with a straight face and defend them 

519.14 525.97 B: [mn] correct yeah and sometimes though they'll withhold evidence knowingly 

520.01 521.14 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

525.99 540.05 B: and maybe the the other lawyer finds out and ah you know accuses them and you know if they're if they're knowingly withholding evidence i don't know if that's considered a form of perjury or a co- or a contempt of court 

538.79 544.82 A: [noise] yeah i guess that would be the thing if they know the person actually [noise] did it but they're saying out the other side of their mouth that they didn't 

544.84 554.79 A: um and withholding stuff you know from a confidential meeting if that's yeah you're right contempt of court or something then that can get 'em in more trouble than just not knowing would 

554.86 559.07 B: yeah or you see the classic example of where they they'll put the lawyer 

559.18 565.94 B: you know in jail for you know a few days or something and have 'em cool off and then decide whether he wants to 

560.53 561.26 A: mm 

562.64 563.50 A: right 

566.08 569.90 B: you know ah bring forth the evidence or or ad- 

570.21 578.48 B: [mn] admit um you know who gave him that evidence or something like that an- and stuff like that and they'll ask him or you know do you want 

578.46 585.76 B: to divulge that information now he says no i don't well put him back in jail for a few more days that's a that's a tough ah 

582.74 583.62 A: mhm 

585.85 590.70 B: career to have where you can end up sitting in jail for a while just because you're doing your job 

590.34 593.14 A: yeah wrestling with those ah 

593.64 595.30 A: the tough kind of um 

595.79 598.55 A: what's the word moral dilemmas that they face every day 

599.14 599.95 B: (( [lipsmack] absolutely ))
