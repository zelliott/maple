0.00 2.02 B: [mn] how're you doing my name's dan 

1.67 4.60 A: hi my name is nina where are you 

4.73 8.62 B: um i'm in california southern california 

7.66 9.62 A: (( wow i'm in new york city )) 

9.74 12.76 B: wow that's ah that's pretty far 

10.36 11.41 A: [laughter] 

11.55 12.35 A: that's 

12.66 15.76 A: great so it's an interesting topic right 

15.47 21.62 B: yeah something about sarcasm and ah i guess the line between bad humor and good humor 

21.25 36.20 A: right well you know one of the things that i always consider is that [lipsmack] sometimes something is funny like if you i mean depending on your own point of view if you think that somebody is is really tasteless in their humor [mn] 

36.48 38.59 A: but what they're really doing is 

39.03 44.10 A: portraying or impersonating a person who has that bad point of view 

44.24 47.96 B: (( mhm yeah i know what you're saying i'm )) 

44.80 48.88 A: (( do you know what i mean like an- like andrew dice clay right )) 

48.93 57.05 A: you know like i used to resent him so because i thought he's up there really making it sound like what he's talking about is okay 

58.07 61.32 B: not quite familiar with ah that person 

61.10 63.72 A: [lipsmack] oh well somebody who has like 

63.79 72.88 A: you know who has really sexist humor or racist humor but they're saying it's not that i think this but i'm talking about people who do think this 

72.96 79.89 B: right right it's kind of like jonathan twist and ah al-dous huxley right kind of 

78.00 79.00 A: um 

79.38 87.17 A: well yeah like sort of in a way except that that was intellectualized that you kind of knew it was satire 

87.02 88.81 B: mhm 

89.30 92.71 B: 'cause i i well so this is like more tasteless humor or mhm 

92.33 98.86 A: yeah like really really sexist humor really really racist humor and 

98.87 103.98 A: you know just making fun of people like you know hard hat people or you know 

104.85 116.05 A: [sigh] something like that i just think that it and then the people who go to see them are the same people about whom they're talking and it sounds as though they're saying what you're doing is fine 

116.97 119.97 B: so you used to resent him correct 

120.41 124.05 A: well that was a mild way of putting it [laughter] but yes 

122.99 127.86 B: [mn] you really probably didn't like him very much and wanted to kick his butt so 

126.29 127.76 A: exactly 

128.37 133.27 B: i mean what about now i mean ha- have your views changed or what 

132.88 143.53 A: well you know he sort of has disappeared so i but i certainly feel that way just in terms of humor in general that sometimes it's truly in bad taste and um [mn] 

144.38 147.89 A: and that's the point of it and i don't know 

148.17 149.41 A: what about you 

149.83 154.79 B: um i'm along the same lines probably i think i mean 

154.93 163.20 B: i i think humor is okay up to a certain extent but when it starts to cross racial lines and anything of that matter i 

162.98 177.60 B: don't think it becomes as funny but i mean if if they're doing it in satire and all in good humor like that i [lipsmack] you know that's that's okay but when they're when they're like just honestly ragging on it that's not cool 

165.51 166.50 A: right 

177.82 184.58 A: [mn] yeah but i guess for me part of this thing is that the- they're doing it as humor but if you are 

184.99 196.15 A: the person like you know if it's racial humor like well if if it's sexist humor and you're a woman do you think it's funny to hear these horrible things about women if 

196.28 198.89 B: oh most definitely not 

196.35 197.33 A: (( you know what )) 

198.06 204.77 A: so that's where like i always get the lines get very confusing for me at that point because um 

205.07 211.08 A: they're saying well we're just talking about how ridiculous it is that people say this but in the end they're saying it 

211.54 212.80 B: right 

211.71 213.28 A: publicly so 

213.86 218.70 A: um i don't know i mean who who do you like as hu- who do you like 

219.29 229.73 B: well like i i mean i'm not too much into satire any more or any of that kind of stuff but i mean i'm guess i'm just more into like blatant humor like chris rock and ah just stuff like that 

224.12 225.03 A: uh-huh 

229.15 230.24 A: uh-huh 

229.93 235.17 B: i mean he makes a pretty good point i i don't know if you've um ever heard of moving called bowling for columbine 

235.16 236.65 A: of course 

236.60 249.16 B: yeah i i think a lot of people have i just i just saw it today and you know there's this one clip about chris rock and he's talking about we don't need gun control we need bullet control now if a bullet was like five thousand dollars then you know 

249.17 252.96 B: i mean like he makes it humorous but then he does make a point to 

253.13 254.12 B: so 

253.78 256.36 A: but wait he says we need what kind of control 

256.34 261.38 B: ah bullet control if if a bullet was like five thousand dollars you'd think twice about shooting someone 

260.47 262.17 A: oh right [laughter] 

262.63 265.27 A: yeah is he bullet worthy [laughter] 

265.29 266.40 B: [laughter] 

266.81 269.15 B: so what part of new york are you from 

268.54 269.77 A: manhattan 

269.65 271.07 B: manhattan okay 

271.17 272.56 A: (( yes )) 

272.57 274.92 A: if we're gonna do it we might as well sorry 

272.57 279.19 B: all right ah yeah sorry i cut you off ah what were you saying 

278.18 279.13 A: no 

279.38 281.49 A: (( just have you ever been to new york )) 

281.82 290.64 B: um no i actually haven't i've been to philadelphia a couple of times and i was planning to go to l._a. but i mean not l._a. new york but that never went through 

290.51 291.51 A: uh-huh 

290.70 291.47 B: so 

292.96 298.36 B: yeah i mean just i think i don't know i think the east coast is pretty cool it's just i like the snow 

298.81 301.06 A: (( oh well that's nice )) 

301.17 302.93 B: yeah 

301.22 303.53 A: but you have snow in california 

304.07 309.62 B: um to be honest i don't think we have snow here i think it's ah 

310.30 312.26 B: i don't know it never snows here 

312.11 318.13 A: well we were down in um palm springs and if you go up to the mountains then people ski in palm springs 

318.04 323.10 B: oh um that's probably bear mountain or something 

322.45 326.81 A: i don't know and then i'm sure that up like up north 

326.98 330.63 A: in the state i know people ski in the north also like in the 

330.85 332.96 A: where [mn] like yosemite 

333.77 344.10 B: yeah i'm i'm actually not too sure on that like the places where i live or where i used to live it never snowed and i used to live up north and i i currently live 

338.56 339.47 A: mhm 

340.09 340.93 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

344.15 347.67 B: ah near l._a. for for college right now 

347.96 350.42 B: and it never really rains either 

350.26 351.39 A: [mn] oh 

351.61 361.75 A: well that's hard but we were in yosemite last year round the place you know there's so many pictures of th- of th- of the mountains covered in snow and that they ah get all snowed in for the winter mm 

363.51 365.61 A: it looked beautiful but 

366.05 368.23 A: not some place i'd want to be [laughter] 

368.36 369.11 B: [laughter] 

369.17 372.02 A: so um and we have enough snow here so 

371.63 381.70 B: yeah definitely like i was there for probably valentines weekend and i got snowed in for like three days three days straight 

380.02 380.58 A: (( [mn] )) 

380.99 384.79 A: oh is it was it fun or was it a bad place to be [laughter] 

384.43 390.53 B: ah it was like twenty four inches of snow and i've never experienced twenty four inches like that 

389.34 390.62 A: wow 

390.65 391.58 B: so 

391.95 393.47 A: that's quite amazing 

393.68 397.04 B: it was an experience definitely 

395.73 396.60 A: (( [laughter] )) 

397.43 398.90 A: (( good for you )) 

399.62 414.10 B: i mean you know i don't i don't really know about humor too much and i don't really listen to humor i mean i don't listen to a lot of like chris rock or any of that i mean i do listen to it somewhat but i mean there's only so much that you can listen to 

408.17 409.30 A: mhm 

410.10 411.04 A: uh-huh 

414.07 421.13 B: you know i i don't know it's like all the humor is kind of raunchy nowadays humor 

421.44 430.08 B: i don't i don't know if you've noticed that but as the years have gone on humor's gone raunchier and raunchier like chris rock is i mean he's pretty raunchy 

429.82 437.06 A: [mn] i know i know and imagine if you see him live as opposed to t._v. because there's always a line there 

430.29 431.06 B: (( you know )) 

435.28 438.91 B: yeah that's got to be so much more fun 

438.77 439.72 A: [laughter] 

439.72 440.61 B: [laughter] 

440.32 454.46 A: i know but i don't know like years ago i remember richard burton the actor said that you know there's such a sho- is there something so wrong with people that they don't have enough command of the language to say something without cursing 

454.36 456.24 B: (( right )) 

454.43 460.98 A: not because certainly not because he was against cursing but just that it is so unimaginative 

461.21 467.52 B: right 'cause i mean it's just like i mean yeah i think it's funny because it's probably crude i mean 

466.50 467.55 A: mhm 

467.45 478.69 B: that's probably one of the reasons why people laugh because yeah you know we got the stereotype of the male you know just beating his chest kinda like a a ape and you know just kinda like cussing scratching himself and stuff like that i 

478.19 479.46 A: (( mhm )) 

479.08 483.91 B: mean that's that's humorous in a no brainer type of way 

483.97 485.73 B: but 

484.03 485.44 A: exactly 

485.80 496.56 B: i mean when i look for humor i i guess that's why i was so attracted to satire in more earlier years i mean i i'm only eighteen right now but i was more attracted to satire probably like two or three years ago 

496.40 497.48 A: wow 

496.45 503.29 B: and you know just i i find that humor when it's intelligent is probably the best type of humor because 

503.39 511.54 B: it strikes those who are intelligent and it strikes those who are less intelligent yeah and it's like 

508.00 512.40 A: mhm mhm well sometimes it goes right over people's heads 

512.43 514.62 B: definite- definitely does 

514.37 518.44 A: well i think one of my favorite is the british humor i just love 

519.26 523.36 B: i don't i don't believe i've ever really read any like british british humor 

523.18 532.75 A: well i don't know so much reading although there are some people who really write funny things in england but like did you ever hear of monty python and the flying circus 

532.80 543.60 B: you know i've heard of that but like i've never i've never ever gotten a chance to like watch monty python or i mean like i've only heard about it all my friends used to do that watch that and stuff but 

542.31 555.55 A: i'm sure that well i know that several of their films are on video and one or two of them are really truly hysterical i mean from the from the credits from the beginning when [laughter] when they have all the introductions and titles 

555.76 557.25 A: and all the way through 

556.56 558.27 B: (( [mn] but )) 

557.94 568.92 A: but they have one i mean they have one of them is really a classic it's called and now for something completely different and it's a number it's just skits from different shows of theirs 

568.97 574.23 A: but then they have one that's called monty python and the meaning of life 

574.53 580.86 A: and it's also skits but they're so f- really bizarre and um 

581.04 583.59 A: some of them are just a riot 

584.51 587.54 B: it's in good taste though right 

586.86 588.28 A: [mn] well 

588.34 596.31 A: in some ways it is and in some ways it isn't because their humor is just so different like they jus- just don't stand their spouting out four letter words 

596.23 597.55 B: [laughter] 

596.72 599.90 A: you know what i mean but they have other kinds of crudeness that
