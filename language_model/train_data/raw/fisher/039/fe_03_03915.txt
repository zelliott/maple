0.00 1.19 B: (( anne )) 

1.42 2.50 A: hello 

2.62 3.53 B: hello 

3.81 5.25 A: hi i'm stan 

5.10 6.36 B: hi i'm anne 

6.71 7.87 B: how are you 

6.73 7.42 A: nice 

7.83 9.69 A: (( i'm doing well how about yourself )) 

9.12 12.87 B: okay thank you okay so we're talking about comedy 

13.09 13.90 A: yes 

13.45 15.56 B: okay so um 

15.62 19.50 B: what do you think is tasteful comedy and not tasteful comedy 

20.40 23.76 A: well i guess in general as long as 

24.04 28.30 A: you're not offending someone um it's tasteful 

28.67 34.65 A: um but it's kind of hard to you know not do that for the most part 

29.01 29.80 B: right 

33.31 41.65 B: i know [laughter] i know i well i happen to think a lot of movies they make today um have ah pretty bad taste comedy [laughter] 

34.85 36.57 A: um 

41.01 43.64 A: (( oh yeah i mean like i said )) 

41.73 42.94 B: (( right )) 

44.43 49.46 A: it's it's hard to kind of draw the line because you don't know how a person's going to take it and 

49.81 61.01 A: or in a group of people or they're going to be and i mean a lot of times people do it with you know honest intentions of maybe educating and maybe kind of getting past it but at the same time 

60.84 65.39 A: and not everybody will be at the same level and that's probably the core of the problem so 

64.71 66.76 B: right like like i feel um 

67.01 68.60 B: they really shouldn't 

68.72 77.09 B: put too much bigotry into comedy because you know it's it's kind of like a fine line there between being funny and ah being offensive 

76.80 78.21 A: exactly 

77.92 79.07 B: right 

78.81 79.90 A: yeah 

79.36 81.05 B: and um 

81.37 82.87 B: i don't know which ah 

82.90 85.80 B: who are your favorite comics or comedians 

85.83 92.22 A: [laughter] well gee as soon as i say that um like i'm very 

86.42 87.90 B: [laughter] 

93.28 95.21 A: like liberal by nature 

95.23 96.84 A: and so 

97.03 104.88 A: to me like sarcasm and in general any kind of sarcasm was like oh very good comedy just because 

104.96 105.85 B: right 

105.25 107.60 A: sarcasm is one of those things where 

107.68 115.72 A: it can be used in a positive manner in a sense where it can be used to you know kind of make people realize and educate yeah 

116.35 121.82 B: i think they kind of the type of comedy that really offends me the most is is rudeness 

116.43 117.37 A: yeah 

122.02 125.64 B: like i've noticed there were some movies lately where um 

126.05 132.33 B: it i think like they're showing being rude is is funny and i just can't um 

132.61 136.08 B: i can't laid on rudeness as being funny 

136.36 140.95 B: ah like ah one one one case in point was that movie um 

136.53 137.55 A: right 

141.00 142.57 B: meet the parents 

142.79 148.15 B: and ah i [laughter] i mean okay like its you know some some parts were funny but 

142.93 144.27 A: oh yes [laughter] 

148.18 153.46 B: um i felt that they treated him a little too rudely 

153.57 160.78 B: and they were being a little too judgmental toward him and that that part i didn't like funny i i didn't think it was funny 

153.72 154.63 A: right 

160.73 162.53 A: yeah it's almost like 

161.88 163.27 B: i i felt like they were 

162.57 166.69 A: and there was so much that even halfway through the m- 

164.76 167.33 B: i felt like they were looking down on him 

167.36 172.78 A: right even halfway through the movie you just felt so bad for the guy that the humor just lost the point you know 

167.61 168.92 B: (( and ah )) 

170.53 183.99 B: yeah [laughter] it was like y- i mean i- like okay like the it did come off as being funny you know because ah the people were v- very talented it was a pretty good script and everything but ah 

173.14 174.45 A: [laughter] 

183.97 193.97 B: but i think just the whole concept that they um [lipsmack] you know like really prejudged him you know in ah not not such a positive way kind of bothered me 

194.22 198.63 B: i i guess i watched that movie i said to myself i wasn't so um 

198.90 202.20 B: i don't know i didn't ah think that movie was too funny 

202.38 208.47 B: i felt that they were just a little bit too rude to him and a little too pre judgmental toward him and ah 

208.84 216.55 B: you know i mean it did have a good outcome which is good you know [laughter] as most comedies do [laughter] [laughter] 

212.13 212.99 A: (( right yeah )) 

214.13 215.09 A: exactly 

215.90 220.20 A: yeah it's it's i guess it's hard to kind of draw the line because 

220.34 224.05 A: you know different things appeal to different people and 

223.79 225.16 B: (( yeah right i mean some- )) 

224.27 231.52 A: it's the i mean it's not like you know the cosby show like where everything is good happy happy and you know 

231.57 235.42 A: like you can never find that kind of comedy any more it's 

235.20 238.07 B: right i know [laughter] 

235.58 238.53 A: like it's like the like now we live in like the 

238.72 240.50 A: cosby show era 

239.99 242.19 B: [laughter] yeah well now i'm 

241.05 246.69 A: you know every sitcom or every movie that comes out is like the opposite of that it's it's never that 

245.14 245.89 B: [laughter] 

246.40 249.94 B: i'll go back even further remember ah all in the family 

250.34 251.97 A: oh i i'm 

250.59 253.70 B: that was [laughter] i mean it was 

252.47 253.59 A: too young for 

253.72 267.04 B: funny you know was a very funny movie of course it was pretty controversial at that time because it brought up a lot of issues that weren't brought up on television before because you know they they got because television was always very slapstick before that 

258.18 259.05 A: (( yeah yeah yeah all )) 

262.16 263.05 A: right 

267.68 274.79 B: you know if you think of the shows back in the fifties and sixties like i love lucy and bewitched and i dream of jeannie 

274.73 288.04 B: i mean if someone didn't get knocked over the head with something in any of those [laughter] [laughter] any of those shows you know it wasn't it wasn't a show you know [laughter] but yeah then all in the family came out and it came out with the oh 

278.26 279.43 A: [laughter] 

283.33 284.63 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

287.85 290.56 B: people with very strong opinions um 

290.27 291.48 A: mhm 

290.87 295.13 B: some people were pretty offended by that show because um 

295.46 303.37 B: they felt maybe they carried it a little bit too far and it always portrayed archie bunker as being the bad guy and always being wrong 

303.46 316.85 B: you know and ah okay he was very bigoted and he was kind of like some males in everything [laughter] but um i think you know that show you know portrayed him like in a very ah 

310.08 310.91 A: right 

316.86 324.28 B: you know negative way i mean ma- maybe more more negative than a p than i believe a per- any person should have been portrayed 

324.24 325.31 A: right 

324.67 326.41 B: you know but um 

327.72 329.67 B: yeah so ah 

330.31 331.02 B: but 

330.56 332.77 A: yeah to me like 

333.00 339.24 A: sometimes i actually enjoy comedies like basically like chris rock because they bring up issues 

339.26 344.75 A: that are kind of true in a sense where all my favorite pieces i've heard personally have 

344.19 355.68 B: chris rock is good i think he's very talented you know i think probably he's more intelligent than most people think he is [laughter] yeah but ah 

345.86 346.91 A: yeah 

347.59 349.23 A: right and 

351.58 352.70 A: yeah exactly 

353.80 359.39 A: yeah one of my favorite parts i ever heard was about when he brought up about diseases and cures like 

359.24 372.80 A: he basically said that you know his point was if you think they are going to find a cure for aids and the answer according to him is no because there's more money in elongating it than finding a cure 

372.30 373.70 B: (( yeah well )) 

373.01 381.90 A: and you know so like i mean he obviously said it in his own way to make it more funny and true but the whole point was it's very possible that you know 

378.85 379.74 B: right 

380.68 388.12 B: he could say something that really isn't funny but he can make it sound funny [laughter] you know [laughter] right right 

384.74 385.88 A: exactly 

386.57 394.95 A: i mean and plus like i mean it it could be very true i mean for all we know you know much money pharmaceutical companies make how much they 

394.93 396.51 A: you know um 

396.38 405.72 A: what it's like sixty percent of like the campaign republican campaign money comes from the pharmaceutical companies like it's just you know it all of it is 

405.59 410.89 A: i mean i'm not trying to be sceptical of everything but it's you know 

410.75 420.72 A: it it's a possibility and it just kind of makes you kind of think like hmm yeah it's funny you laugh at it but then it also kind of makes you think that's the comedy i think i enjoy more than anything else so 

420.90 422.92 B: (( another type of comedy )) 

421.04 424.09 A: it's good to you know laugh at stuff but you know 

422.90 436.18 B: that i notice is out a lot today is a lot of um i guess in way we're we're going towards slapstick but i think we're being sillier about it than we've ever been before [laughter] you know shows a lot like ah jackass 

433.26 434.26 A: yeah 

435.63 437.29 A: jackass yeah i know the one 

436.33 451.03 B: [laughter] you know and i guess they're more shows you know like like jackass and ah i have an eighteen year old son and he a he finds you know shows like that so incredibly funny [laughter] it 

442.21 443.08 A: (( ah )) 

448.40 452.08 A: yeah i mean i have a younger brother who's 

451.54 454.32 B: [laughter] yeah and it 

453.55 460.79 A: it's not just i mean everybody i know people in like thirties like who like who love jackass and i'm just like wow that's 

457.20 462.05 B: who liked it yeah [laughter] [laughter] 

461.74 467.55 A: (( you know it's i mean like like i said it's and another thing is it's also like )) 

468.96 471.96 A: like for a lot of people like you know it's 

472.53 475.76 A: life sucks in many ways and it's like a kind of 

475.46 477.65 B: well comedy is our outlet you 

476.20 485.62 A: very cynical and poor world and so like any kind of like humor where you can just kind of forget about everything and even if it's the dumbest thing you've ever seen but 

477.78 478.55 B: know 

481.26 482.10 B: right 

485.57 492.55 A: as long as it's something that you just need something where you don't have to think and you just want to laugh and you just want to laugh at somebody at at times and 

492.10 493.29 B: exactly 

492.49 502.74 A: it's just a very good outlet and so i think that like those shows are kind of even more [sigh] successful at times because people don't want to deal with reality 

496.39 497.65 B: (( exactly )) 

499.64 500.47 B: i would 

500.64 501.32 B: (( for ))
