13.85 14.94 B: okay 

14.14 15.73 A: have you done one of these before 

15.38 22.77 B: yeah i did two of 'em already and i thought the topic was just going to be comedy but it sounds like it's where do you draw the line 

17.14 17.96 A: uh-huh 

22.81 27.18 B: between acceptable humor and not i mean it's ah it's 

25.07 26.25 A: yeah 

27.24 30.92 B: it it's a fine line okay you know and ah 

30.93 41.91 B: yeah actually i'm i'm thinking in the back of my mind i've been i've been told i do good comedy and people have been urging me to do stand up comedy for a while but i don't get involved really too much with ah 

38.39 39.08 A: (( okay )) 

42.17 48.62 B: any ethnic humor or things like that i don't do i don't do that kind of stuff i just ah are are you in new york by the way 

48.23 49.76 A: yeah i'm in brooklyn 

49.48 52.31 B: oh okay i just do things like ah 

52.39 57.82 B: on some of these weird things that people in new york do [laughter] everything you know the weird behaviour or something 

55.03 56.11 A: (( oh okay )) 

57.23 58.87 A: (( oh y- oh okay yeah )) 

58.26 62.96 B: yeah yeah how do you feel about that topic about the ah topic that they asked about 

61.61 64.75 A: um i think um 

65.38 65.94 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

66.41 71.88 A: well i i mean i don't have a problem with um i mean as long as it's not too distasteful 

71.52 72.65 B: mhm 

71.80 83.06 A: i mean i i can understand like even you know if they if a comic'll do racist humor like one of my favorite comedians is don rickles and he is just he he he there's no limits with him 

79.36 80.31 B: yeah 

82.78 90.64 B: oh right no i like him too i find him to be very funny and he's not at all like that you know because he's very very generous towards his friends 

85.29 86.16 A: sure 

89.60 90.58 A: mhm 

90.57 103.09 B: and ah it's it's an act everybody knows it's an act but the thing is like that they don't know you you know like if you're performing ah a comedy act or something you have to be careful because people don't know who you are 

91.00 92.13 A: definitely 

103.10 111.05 B: you know and and ah it can ah upset a lot of people very easily um you know 

103.58 104.66 A: oh right 

109.84 112.85 A: oh definitely yeah you have to know your audience i guess 

112.32 115.51 B: right i mean one of my fears is that since i'm 

115.53 130.32 B: my routines [cough] the things i the things i find absurd about people in new york i mean i- it could insult people or it could make 'em laugh because i'm sure a lot of people do this like ever notice when it starts to drizzle a slight drizzle a lot of people open up an umbrella 

130.14 131.20 A: mhm 

130.54 135.47 B: at the slightest drizzle and yet they'll walk right in front of a moving car without any thoughts of getting hit 

134.51 136.07 A: absolutely 

135.35 149.45 B: you know and it just it's so it's so inconsistent and everything you know and people screaming out loud on cellphones on the street and everything talking about their personal business how much money they have in their bank account you know it's like ah you it's like it's like i feel like saying you know can i ah i 

145.19 146.67 A: oh it's crazy 

149.42 153.72 B: i might as well stay come in the house and eat dinner with 'em if they're going to talk about their personal stuff 

151.69 152.92 A: i know 

153.30 156.53 A: some of the esp- especially with the cellphones now man 

156.15 159.21 B: oh yeah yeah oh you feel the same way 

158.65 167.35 A: oh yeah especially on the like if you're on the subway and you're going over a bridge or if you're even if you're on like the one and the nine line 

161.70 162.74 B: mhm 

163.44 164.74 B: mhm 

166.99 168.04 B: okay 

167.49 171.32 A: up there you can use the cellphone under underground for a lot of places 

169.83 176.97 B: oh okay it's funny you tell me that because i was using that today and i saw somebody using a cellphone a couple of times on the one oh nine 

176.51 177.55 A: uh-huh 

177.07 185.32 B: and i've been riding it and i'm wondering how in the world they can use that you're not supposed to use it in the subway you're not they say you can't use it do you know how y- they could do it 

184.80 188.27 A: well ah because up there part of the time it's um 

188.36 191.14 A: because i think it's so close to to above ground 

188.51 189.31 B: el- 

190.63 191.67 B: okay 

191.49 198.06 A: but um eventually they said within a few years all the subways you'll be able to talk on the phone they're going to they're putting them under the ground so 

195.61 197.43 B: (( right yeah )) 

197.54 199.77 B: yeah but i didn't know 

199.80 210.34 B: okay so thanks you answered my question because i was very curious i saw it today i saw it a couple of months ago i was wondering what's going on here and everybody on the train gets the the same reaction like looking like they're dead 

210.21 224.66 B: now that kind of humor you know it's not offensive but some people may actually be offended if they hear it i i assume i mean because maybe they engage in that behaviour you know they'll open up an umbrella i mean i don't use umbrellas anyway i never use them [laughter] 

211.89 212.97 A: yeah 

224.00 227.00 A: yeah unless it's a torrential downpour i'm not a big fan 

226.45 238.68 B: right yeah yeah and i don't even i i try not i try to avoid using them at all costs if i have to use a hat i'll use a hat because i've had umbrellas break on me and everything you know and it was just ah very frustrating so um mhm 

233.76 235.02 A: oh of course 

237.16 242.72 A: but like with this topic um what do you think about like movies like american pie 

238.83 239.93 B: mhm 

242.93 249.70 A: or things like that with like or like even like the old school movies like porkies and like old school like old school stuff mhm 

243.00 243.99 B: okay 

247.19 256.36 B: okay yeah porkies i know i haven't seen american pie haven't seen any recent movies ah i didn't find porkies offensive was there anything in there that ah 

255.89 263.76 A: well i guess for the time it was there was a lot of nudity and like there there was the woman who um you know when she was having sex she sounded like a dog 

258.96 259.95 B: right 

263.17 264.34 B: okay 

263.98 271.95 A: so there was that so i guess that was questionable and i guess some people would have thought that was offensive but why would you see porkies though you know if you if you don't want to be 

266.67 267.73 B: yeah 

270.09 280.16 B: yeah well why would you right why would you see it if you're not expec- that that kind of stuff i mean that's ah i thought i heard a buzz just now i don't know if ah they may give us a signal soon 

279.86 280.90 A: oh i don't know 

280.36 281.99 B: i um 

282.04 283.59 B: find that ah 

283.76 289.87 B: i think what this study's talking about is maybe ethnic humor where you're insulting maybe 

289.78 299.94 B: a a a group of people or something or a- any kind of a disability or something something like that where you have to be careful i mean some shows have gotten in trouble for doing this 

292.14 293.10 A: right 

300.06 313.77 B: um i would try to be very very conscious if i ever did stand up comedy of people's feelings but you know i mean some of my act is ah criticizing the way people are in new york i mean this is the ah 

305.25 306.08 A: right 

312.15 313.16 A: sure 

313.55 319.83 A: and i think we have one of the biggest backbones you know in the country that i think the audiences can take it most of them i guess in new york 

316.50 317.62 B: mhm 

319.02 327.31 B: and they probably could you know i mean it's ah because people made fun of them before and they kind of know the way they behave and ah 

323.89 324.73 A: mhm 

327.34 335.40 B: um i've been in groups of people what well imitating people on cellphones and it's gotten a lot of laughs and everything you know and i tell funny because the people i'm talking 

335.45 341.80 B: use cellphones i mean every mo- i think about seventy percent of people in new york use cellphones but it's great comedy material 

341.58 342.30 A: and 

341.91 343.04 B: yeah 

342.44 354.77 A: yeah and wh- what's even crazy now is that they keep the cellphone in the pocket and they have the um the little um cord that comes up and they talk right into the cord and you can't even you don't even see the cellphone now and you think they're talking to you 

349.38 352.32 B: oh oh god oh they 

354.32 355.91 B: (( ah )) 

354.67 358.61 A: they're like hey how's it going and you turn around and you're like hey and they're talking to somebody 

357.05 368.22 B: oh i'm it's it's going fine until i met ya [laughter] you know i might just give them a look what in the world are they doing and if you ever look at people they don't even notice you're looking at 'em you know i mean it's like ah 

359.54 360.54 A: [laughter] 

365.64 366.50 A: yeah 

368.04 371.84 A: they're in their own wor- it's like the other person's there and they're having their own little conversation 

371.36 378.46 B: yeah yeah yeah it is it is weird [mn] but it is funny it's good material most people use the handheld phones 

372.51 373.96 A: but it's so funny 

377.95 379.25 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

378.44 382.92 B: you know and um i myself i mean i don't want a cellphone right now 

382.86 395.41 B: and ah it comes in handy that's for sure but i sure don't want to bore people with my personal conversations on the street you know i'm i'm used to doing it at home and everything you know that's what i'm used to it and in an emergency it's an excellent thing 

388.60 389.93 A: oh of course 

395.19 402.32 B: but you know i mean the abuse of it ma- must make good comedy material they should go to these comedy clubs and take a look at what they're doing nowadays 

401.98 409.10 A: yeah carolines or or something like that or even i like in the village i think they have smaller ones now 

403.49 404.56 B: yeah 

404.67 406.14 B: yeah 

408.89 421.16 B: okay i may look into it because i met somebody who also is very funny and we we would make a good team you know and ah but i don't know i mean it's it's a lot to ask i mean people told me for years i should do this kind of stuff 

414.64 415.43 A: yeah 

421.12 425.29 B: and i've always turned away from it you know because it's not something that ah 

423.12 424.03 A: right 

425.30 438.26 B: i i have performance anxiety where as soon as i have to think of something funny i i can't think it's when i'm not supposed to think of something funny that i can think of something funny which may be funny in itself [laughter] i mean i could talk on stage about performance anxiety 

430.22 431.10 A: (( [laughter] )) 

431.83 432.60 A: right 

434.83 435.67 A: mhm 

438.02 439.03 A: there you go 

438.09 448.12 B: but ah you know i mean it's a good way to make some money and ah get some notoriety you know and ah i mean who knows what might happen it's something i'm interested in 

443.02 443.95 A: sure 

448.16 453.41 B: and um that's why i i mean you could call up this number and ah not ah 

453.56 457.28 B: not take part in the um in the question of the day 

457.47 462.10 B: i don't know if you know that it was told me that ah you can just c- initiate the call on your own 

461.75 462.85 A: oh you can 

462.46 472.13 B: yeah yeah so i called up the other night and i get a topic that interested me so i just hung up i mean and then they called me to tonight i wasn't home and i didn't pick up i mean you know i just ah 

469.55 470.46 A: mhm 

472.12 478.31 B: i mean if i if i don't know what the topic of the day is i'm not going to do it [laughter] you know but ah 

475.17 476.02 A: right 

476.62 479.55 A: yeah but it's an interesting topic and 

478.92 480.17 B: yeah it is 

479.76 481.63 A: i'd like to know um 

481.85 483.95 A: (( [lipsmack] i don't know i i )) 

485.93 493.32 A: guess it's not i guess i don't find too many things questionable i guess i find a lot of things 

493.51 495.44 A: funny and i think whatever you can 

495.92 504.10 A: i mean as long as it's not hurting anybody i see i really think like don rickles when he he gets everybody he gets every group 

497.74 500.07 B: mhm mhm right 

503.46 504.91 B: oh yeah 

504.33 509.04 A: black jewish gay everything and it eh eh right 

505.94 513.10 B: right but they know [mn] they know in advance you know and i've seen him a couple of times go a little bit beyond the borders 

509.52 510.85 A: absolutely 

512.83 513.74 A: right 

513.18 516.98 B: but ah he's really a very gentle kind person 

516.82 517.71 A: sure 

517.23 528.57 B: the exact opposite a lot of people on stage in comedy and everything and in film they are the exact opposite lucille ball wasn't a dumb redhead she was a very conniving very mean woman actually 

521.16 522.12 A: mhm 

527.93 529.05 A: yeah 

528.50 535.07 B: you know and ah people really didn't want to work with her and ah you remember a- abbot and costello 

534.64 535.82 A: mhm 

535.09 541.11 B: yeah ah it w- it was the opposite bud abbot was the one who wasn't that great and lou costello was the brains behind the whole thing 

540.69 541.93 A: really 

541.20 544.51 B: but yet on stage and on screen and television 

544.66 549.27 B: they portrayed an image the opposite of what they really are jack bennie wasn't cheap 

547.16 548.17 A: wow 

549.33 552.41 B: at all but you know it was just it was just they 

550.59 553.00 A: mm i didn't know that 

552.36 564.34 B: yeah yeah it's usually the opposite of what ah i mean i didn't know jack bennie [laughter] but i i mean i've heard he was very generous with his money and you know i'm sure he was and everything you know he had lots of money but it just it went along with his um 

556.57 557.67 A: yeah 

564.35 570.04 B: his personality but the thing is what's good about these comedians was that they had excellent timing you know 

565.44 566.44 A: mhm 

569.49 570.67 A: oh sure 

570.05 572.82 B: i mean the you know and there was just ah 

572.91 575.32 B: it was just a gift and ah 

575.39 579.31 B: i mean i don't know i mean eh the present ones don't compare 

579.50 592.50 B: i think to the real masters because they were the originals the the present ones like jay leno to me is an imitation of johnny carson on the tonight show he's like ah you know a a younger version getting older of ah of johnny carson 

582.31 583.26 A: mhm 

586.94 587.80 A: right 

590.62 591.37 A: (( sure )) 

592.54 596.37 B: you see this is the first time you've participated in this the first call 

595.92 598.24 A: yeah first first ever
