3.31 5.05 A: hi this is jean 

6.73 7.79 B: hi there 

8.62 13.49 A: i'm very new at this this is first time so i'm not really sure what all we're supposed to but 

13.90 16.09 A: if you know you start [laughter] 

15.69 29.99 B: [mn] hm [mn] i'll tell you actually fir- first time today too but um i guess what they want us is to t- to talk about the ah topic and um i i was checking the website about ah two weeks ago when i registered and i notice that there's quite a few things that they 

29.93 44.16 B: have listed there so i thought it was interesting and i and the recording said comedy so i guess um i guess we can talk about the um [lipsmack] what they said on the at at at the beginning of the call which was um [lipsmack] acceptable acceptable humor and i guess the the lines for 

44.37 54.01 B: i guess the boundaries so i guess you know i guess we could talk about that [laughter] [lipsmack] and i don't know i guess i'll tell you i guess ab- i'll just talk a little bit about myself i actually like 

48.64 49.93 A: okay 

53.79 59.97 B: movies very much i i actually i i'm trying to get into movie making or [lipsmack] i'm a- i'm getting into movie making 

60.11 61.54 B: and um 

62.07 70.64 B: [lipsmack] i'm very actually very open minded but ah at the time i'm very sensitive certainly i don't know how to put it i- i'm always in the middle of things i i i 

70.67 73.60 B: ah how could we put it let's say comedy wise 

73.71 77.61 B: i could probably laugh about something that you could say oh no that's nasty but oh it's funny 

77.65 90.30 B: and at the same time i could i could i could probably at the same time say well ah that that was probably a little too much or maybe you should have done it differently i think it depends on where you are or maybe when whether you are you are by yourself or would it be maybe whether you're with somebody else 

90.09 97.32 B: [mn] or maybe if you know with your inner group of friends or maybe with a with family that you know if you laugh you won't be seen 

97.46 104.87 B: as being offensive because you're participating of that maybe maybe you know you're a bit more comfortable or maybe if you're in a gro- in a group 

104.97 116.43 B: [mn] maybe in a in a in a [lipsmack] i don't know maybe you're watching television with people you don't know maybe you would be more cautious about how much you wo- you're gonna go with that gag i guess i'm i'm [mn] you know so in part i guess it has to do with 

116.50 120.74 B: how you want to be perceived i guess [lipsmack] and sure 

118.79 120.44 A: can i ask you a question 

121.28 126.48 A: not exac- you don't have to tell me your exact age but are you in your twenties or thirties 

123.76 124.61 B: sure 

125.66 128.44 B: [mn] hm [lipsmack] i am in my thirties yes 

128.17 130.27 A: okay [mn] um 

130.61 134.91 A: i'm forty seven so i probably view comedy differently than you do 

134.57 135.84 B: (( mhm [lipsmack] )) 

135.45 136.99 A: in the fact that 

137.04 148.26 A: the older you get the more what you consider funny you laugh at and if somebody else has a problem with it it's their problem [laughter] um 

146.54 147.95 B: right right hm 

148.33 151.21 A: it's not that i don't like things that are 

151.42 153.59 A: racist that bothers me 

153.17 154.44 B: mhm 

154.03 160.02 A: ah i do not you know say to somebody else okay you don't have the right to laugh but i would not laugh at that 

158.00 158.83 B: mhm 

159.88 161.01 B: right 

160.42 161.45 A: um 

162.18 170.25 A: i do find off color jokes humorous which a lot of people do not but hey live and let live 

169.80 170.72 B: [laughter] 

170.74 172.19 A: (( ah [laughter] )) 

171.67 172.89 B: yeah 

172.66 174.17 A: one of my ah 

175.44 178.25 A: favorite comedians has got to be george carlin 

178.04 179.24 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

178.66 181.25 A: i like his um 

182.46 184.48 A: skewed look at life 

183.95 185.44 B: mhm 

185.97 189.96 A: and let's see who else do i like that's a good comedian 

190.32 192.05 B: [mn] do you like robin williams 

191.87 193.01 A: oh yeah 

192.61 194.30 B: (( yeah i like him too mm [mn] )) 

193.75 196.76 A: he's very good and he's so quick minded 

196.71 197.61 B: (( yes )) 

197.20 202.57 A: i thought all these years that his comedy was based on his drug use but he swears 

202.83 205.97 A: that now he's not doing drugs and he's still just as funny 

205.68 207.22 B: (( mhm right [mn] right )) 

206.76 209.98 A: now i won't say i don't believe him 

210.26 214.19 A: but i just say his comedy's still good [laughter] either way 

212.63 213.72 B: (( yeah )) 

214.52 215.56 B: (( right [lipsmack] )) 

215.55 218.63 B: i got cable not too lon- well about a year ago but i 

218.39 232.06 B: um [mn] i actually had all the channels where you were able to see some of the comedy specials on h._b._o. and everything [mn] but i had to cut 'em ah a few months ago because it was a little i didn't really see all the channels and i didn't really have the money to pay everything you know the whole 

231.90 232.92 A: yeah 

232.29 244.98 B: gambit of channels but i w- got to see parts of [mn] george carlin and he and but he's very clever and i like him ah there were things about oh but actually i that's par- i guess part of what i'm saying i- i- it um [lipsmack] in a way 

245.64 246.78 B: (( [mn] a lot of it ah )) 

247.20 262.02 B: it made sense and it and it could be like you were saying you know a skewed way at times but he was [mn] ah i- i- in a way i guess you could say he was funny and he he made sense and he he was represented in a very clever way as well and i'm sure that some people could probably be offended about certain things of it 

261.78 273.16 B: but sometimes yeah but sometimes i think when people may get offended about something [mn] [lipsmack] maybe ah and my invitation to probably to them would be try to hear what they're saying in the back because sometimes when someone could be very ironic or or something 

261.90 262.81 A: oh yeah 

272.99 279.12 B: somebody could probably miss a point and go with ah only with the outside part of it and sometimes these comedians who are 

279.03 291.30 B: maybe the kind of comedians we're talking about have something deeper that they're they're ma- they're criticizing or talking about [mn] an- and a- actually going down the line there's um [mn] ah i actually got also got a chance about two months ago before i g- i i 

284.68 285.73 A: exactly 

291.15 301.44 B: changed service i got to see some of the ah john leguizamo i say leguizamo because that's i think that's the way it's pronounced but john leguizamo the actor or the comedian show and he's [mn] um 

301.45 315.60 B: [mn] like he talks like ah what was the name of the show i forgot but he was talking a lot about his background his family growing in new york and and and his dysfunctional father and and then he has all these voices and then he portrays he can portray sometimes 

315.56 318.57 B: ah hi- his girl cousin or sometimes a father 

318.73 323.30 B: and i don't know how they go they call it foul mouth i think i think he used a load of cu- cu- 

323.21 332.48 B: cursing and he was kind of um [mn] kind of out there but but he w- he had he was i think he was um i could perceive what he was doing he was talking about certain things that maybe 

332.27 347.08 B: [mn] maybe just giving examples of how if you do this then this will happen and if people are you know are able to see that then they can probably learn something about maybe someone who came from a bad background and at the same time maybe in a funny way and maybe if if if any even if it isn't funny for that person 

346.90 349.17 B: [mn] they probably could see something there 

349.52 354.04 B: um i don't know [mn] i- i'm i'm just being long winded right now but um 

353.80 354.75 A: [laughter] 

354.26 355.79 B: (( yeah actually yeah mhm )) 

354.92 365.26 A: i like him too and the thing about if you'll notice practically with every comedian there's something traumatic or bad or dysfunctional has happened to them 

365.22 371.19 A: and that's why they went to comedy and somehow during their life they'll work that into the routines 

371.18 372.03 B: right 

371.22 378.15 A: [noise] and you can just always y- to me when you you see the ah comedy 

378.36 383.47 A: ah smiling face and the tragedy frowning face you have to think 

383.68 391.84 A: of comedians because all of their humor is coming from what they've endured and they're laughing on the outside but a lot of times you can look at their eyes and see 

387.56 388.36 B: right 

391.85 394.63 A: that's not really humor to them 

393.21 395.38 B: (( mhm right right [lipsmack] )) 

394.79 396.56 A: it's too close to the truth it's 

396.72 398.76 A: the same with like louie anderson 

398.81 399.67 B: right 

399.06 407.66 A: now he has he's had a bad background but i mean of course everybody laughs at his comedy but it's all about things that's happened to him 

402.54 403.45 B: (( right right )) 

407.33 414.41 B: right [mn] right right i've seen parts of his of his show and i kind of learned that yeah that he he went through a lot of stuff 

414.79 416.24 B: and um 

416.51 417.56 B: [lipsmack] yeah 

416.81 421.83 A: i just wonder where the whole society would be today if comedy was not a part of it 

421.67 423.31 B: (( [lipsmack] right mhm mhm mhm )) 

422.51 423.56 A: (( i mean 'cause )) 

423.97 434.04 A: there's so many bad things just daily bad things if you can't tell a joke or you know a- say something that's punny or you know something 

434.47 437.23 A: you would just be so dragged down i don't think 

437.25 441.46 A: you know i don't think the world would exist you have to have comedy in it 

441.50 442.63 B: (( [lipsmack] right [lipsmack] )) 

442.92 447.90 A: and i don't mean making fun of people i mean actual belly laugh comedy [laughter] 

447.39 448.84 B: mhm 

448.95 455.54 B: [lipsmack] i i many times most people who i i you know like wh- when i talk to people many of course in my 

455.72 463.31 B: sometimes circle of friends or people i know would like him but i wonder if you like woody allen 'cause many people don't like him even my mom's going oh i don't like him ah and i wonder what it is 

463.08 474.60 B: sometimes about people who tha- that they don't like woody allen i love i think i think he's he's a genius and the movie you know i'm talking about his work and the story telling and the and the movies and and comedy and everything yeah 

472.53 473.74 A: well see that's th- 

473.89 478.03 A: yeah you have to separate him from his work and him as a person 

475.64 476.48 B: right 

477.75 478.91 B: right 

478.54 483.33 A: him as a person ah he's not so hot he's made some dumb mistakes 

480.59 481.50 B: right 

482.10 482.84 B: (( right [mn] )) 

483.38 486.30 A: him as a film director 

486.63 489.25 A: him as a comedian that's a whole -nother story 

488.96 490.07 B: (( right right )) 

489.87 491.89 A: but see his is based on 

491.90 496.70 A: his life and h- his bad things come through his comedy 

496.39 497.68 B: mhm 

497.07 505.83 A: and people can laugh at it whereas i'm sure he was in therapy years and years and a lot of the stuff [laughter] that he puts on but 

505.04 506.39 B: (( hm yeah mhm )) 

505.96 510.26 A: it ah we get the comedy out of it and that's that's the good thing about comedians we don't 

510.34 513.24 A: we don't have to hear the therapy sessions just the 

512.83 514.01 B: (( right )) 

513.33 515.19 A: the funny remarks [laughter] 

514.49 522.35 B: that's funny you have very interesting points of view yeah yeah that's that's it's very interesting the way you mention it [laughter] yes i'm thirty six and and um 

518.10 519.22 A: [laughter] 

522.27 526.60 B: [lipsmack] and actually i i would love to be able down the line when i'm able to 

526.41 537.28 B: do it although i'm already getting into this but i'd love to be able to make comedies i'm actually i'm o- open to everything but comedy is something that just really fills me even if [mn] even if if they have music and stuff like that that will be fantastic too 

537.23 541.96 B: to make i know there's some some new movies coming out there's one called a might- a mighty wind about [mn] 

542.05 556.64 B: folksingers and i i appear in one scene it was really funny and i like the i've seen a- some other films he's made before one called best in show about this dog ah contest and and it was so funny it was a very very funny [mn] movie so i hope i can get a chance to see that other one so 

542.85 543.76 A: mhm 

549.81 550.71 A: oh yeah 

552.82 553.63 A: yeah 

555.38 559.04 A: i think comedy is really hard to do i mean 

559.10 562.74 A: ah my hat's off to you if you can do comedy you know [laughter] 

561.75 563.66 B: (( [mn] yeah [laughter] right mhm )) 

562.94 564.26 A: that would be 

564.44 568.76 A: ah an undertaking that should be very well received because 

569.22 577.12 A: anything that you ever hear i mean drama is one thing and people can act dramatic easily but if you've got comic timing 

577.66 579.83 A: you've got to be able to tell a joke 

579.96 588.80 A: and have the right inflection in your voice the right facial you know or whatever and to direct a comedian can you imagine directing robin williams 

583.81 584.58 B: right 

588.46 589.50 B: right 

588.86 590.62 A: he's so improvisational 

590.23 591.44 B: right right 

590.82 594.23 A: you'd never keep him on the script if you tried 

591.88 593.39 B: [laughter] 

593.88 595.26 B: yeah yeah yeah 

594.49 595.64 A: [laughter] 

596.55 598.85 A: what do you think about jim carey 

598.09 599.89 B: (( yes ah funny thing i was going to mention too that ))
