86.25 87.17 A: mhm

92.91 100.58 A: oh i don't want my i don't want my fa- i don't let my daughter watch any of the comedy that they show nowadays and i don't want unless it's classic 

93.72 94.81 B: (( wh- [noise] [noise] )) 

100.54 111.08 A: and i don't allow my husband to watch it because i think it's filthy nowadays they show too much and they they don't understand that kissing isn't funny 

100.56 101.58 B: mhm 

104.07 105.36 B: exactly 

111.28 122.96 B: exactly the last comedy last primetime comedy show i watched when it was playing in in in primetime was full house with the remember with the t- the twins and everybody and danny and uncle 

121.31 122.19 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

122.97 132.21 B: uncle joey and everybody that that was a wh- i mean that's and since then i just don't know i mean i go to the library once a week and and we get tons of movies er you know for free 

132.10 133.17 A: mhm 

132.24 134.93 B: you only have to pay to t- take them out you know and i i 

134.83 139.02 B: i i can't even think of all of them and i think my kids are um 

138.87 141.17 B: one's nineteen and one's sixteen and i think 

140.99 144.67 B: i think i'd never let them watch anything filthy never 

144.46 153.67 B: and i think because of that er their minds gotten better they have better they they think better they behave better they they my kids don't don't don't do that toilet humor 

153.44 165.26 B: you know they don't even like to watch and and i can even trust my kids alone with the t._v. but they don't even want to watch that kind of thing because they know it just it's it's just like eating a a meal out of the toilet you know what you know what i mean 

165.05 169.47 A: mhm well i have a two year old and she's really impressionable 

166.00 166.85 B: yeah 

169.24 170.40 B: (( mhm )) 

169.42 183.69 A: and so it's better that she watches the stuff that she can actually learn from compared to the stuff that has all these swear words because she she'll say them but you know she doesn't understand what they mean if they're shown to her 

183.92 185.46 B: (( [noise] exactly )) 

184.04 194.06 A: and it's best that she doesn't know them because that shows that she's more intelligent than what they're showing on the television as well as other children who are saying those words 

193.89 205.38 B: well make sure you stick to your guns with her 'cause i had a battle with people and and people would go oh you're being so narrow minded and also they'd go oh you know but no no that that's how you keep your kids clean you know that's how you keep them from 

205.24 211.28 B: from from being like that is you stick to your guns you make sure you know you make sure the garbage doesn't go in and you you

303.56 304.97 B: you know and uh 

303.64 305.62 A: ouch mhm
