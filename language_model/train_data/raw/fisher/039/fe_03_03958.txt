47.94 49.81 B: [laughter] 

48.89 49.65 A: (( d- )) 

49.74 51.21 A: does happen in real life 

50.85 52.07 B: yeah 

51.35 52.45 A: [laughter] 

52.55 62.03 B: well i i'm trying to um remember just how she put that it was ah i it's about comedy do you remember just how she worded that 

59.11 60.14 A: mhm 

61.37 67.91 A: yeah what's the what kind of a line do you draw between acceptable humor and um [mn] 

69.00 69.94 A: and 

70.02 71.93 A: humor in bad taste 

71.52 74.69 B: yeah [mn] well y- you know 

75.15 89.41 B: like say [mn] there's a lot of ah [lipsmack] puns that you know are projected at the president and you know anybody up there at the top level i mean someone is always going to [mn] um get some humor into it 

81.29 82.30 A: mhm 

89.10 90.21 A: oh yeah 

89.61 92.44 B: but a lot of times it's in bad taste 

92.10 93.40 A: oh yeah 

92.80 100.06 B: you know because really most of 'em that are there in that position they have a tremendous responsibility 

100.20 106.41 B: and [lipsmack] you know i think it's in poor taste [mn] you know to make a lot of humor over that 

105.59 109.22 A: [mn] oh yeah i agree they're doing the best they can 

107.32 108.71 B: i like um 

108.79 120.45 B: i like humor like um [mn] oh like [mn] jack benny used to be you know when he was on i don't know if you ever remember hearing him or not it was probably before your time but he was really a comedian 

116.56 117.66 A: oh 

120.49 121.40 A: oh yeah 

120.66 124.44 B: and ah there was um ones i really enjoyed 

124.49 128.55 B: were abbott lew abbott and um [mn] costello 

128.33 129.78 A: oh okay yeah 

129.19 139.06 B: i'm sure you've heard of them because you know they they've even carried those movies through the years but i mean they were the funniest things it was just slapstick comedy 

130.80 131.75 A: yeah 

135.03 135.87 A: oh sh- 

138.76 139.70 A: (( ahah )) 

139.26 144.53 B: and even though you laughed at 'em you know it wasn't like you were being critical 

144.45 145.40 A: right 

144.95 149.98 B: i mean you were just having fun with them and that's kind of where i kind of draw the line you know 

149.48 151.84 A: yeah [mn] well i think 

150.34 151.40 B: (( how about you )) 

152.05 160.82 A: you know um who is that one guy eddie murphy he is the h- most horrible i mean for stand up [mn] 'cause he's so dirty 

160.64 162.26 B: yeah 

161.16 162.87 A: i don't like dirty humor 

162.35 163.50 B: i don't either 

163.50 171.53 A: [mn] i think that's just and i mean [mn] it's like he has to swear in order to make a joke and i absolutely hate that so bad [mn] like 

168.44 170.27 B: right 

170.57 174.11 B: and then they have to throw the sex in or something like that you know 

173.10 175.06 A: (( absolutely [mn] yeah )) 

174.37 177.20 B: always has to be something like that 

176.28 179.19 A: i always thought bill cosby used to be so funny 

178.62 180.29 B: yeah 

179.38 182.57 A: 'cause he never swore and he was so funny 

181.96 183.67 B: he was just dry humor 

183.38 184.94 A: yeah [laughter] 

183.97 193.02 B: i can remember um [lipsmack] having a lot of courses and um they used to use him a lot you know ah on different subjects 

193.03 193.97 A: mhm 

193.38 200.20 B: and um like at college you know they'd have him put something on and it was always in good taste 

199.82 200.90 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

200.30 203.65 B: you know he had that humor to him it was it was funny 

202.23 202.94 A: (( mm )) 

203.56 204.53 A: yeah 

203.89 207.15 B: but it wasn't you know bad 

206.33 215.91 A: i think it i think it's because he took so much out of real life you know when he was talking about kids you could totally look at your kids and see exactly what he was talking about [mn] that was so funny 

209.67 210.56 B: (( ahah )) 

212.35 213.23 B: right 

214.89 217.90 B: and you can't say that [mn] you know it was based um 

218.06 222.21 B: you know on his race or anything because everybody really loved him you know 

222.00 226.19 A: oh yeah for the most part i mean [mn] he did do a c- 

222.99 224.19 B: (( i [mn] )) 

225.01 227.44 B: there was no prejudice i don't think there 

227.49 240.14 A: he he did do a couple of things where he [mn] you know he was dressed in white face and and he he played you know the the typical racist white person you know but [mn] i 

233.69 234.64 B: mhm 

235.34 236.45 B: yeah 

240.22 246.78 A: think that was mostly for statement not i mean that was when he was really young too 

246.36 247.30 B: right 

247.15 248.29 A: and um 

248.77 257.23 A: so but i mean [mn] even then if you wanna make a statement that's one thing i mean that's part of freedom of speech that's why we live here in america [laughter] 

256.26 257.45 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

257.30 262.55 A: but i mean when when you just start throwing stuff at people i mean like the pres like you said the president 

262.61 263.62 B: right 

263.18 264.58 A: [mn] he ah 

264.80 266.63 A: i mean you only get one president 

266.68 268.19 A: you can't have ten 

267.33 267.89 B: (( [mn] )) 

268.03 269.27 B: mhm 

268.60 274.80 A: so i mean if the president if that's the way he is then that's the way he is and he's doing the best he can 

272.91 279.15 B: well they they were critical of bill clinton but then when you stop to think about it he was in the public eye 

279.10 279.86 A: (( oh yeah )) 

279.25 282.68 B: but ah there probably isn't a man today 

282.71 286.11 B: [mn] that hasn't done the things that they accused him of doing you know 

286.07 289.39 A: yeah it was just 'cause he was the president and he's supposed to be 

287.69 290.55 B: that was just because he was up there mhm 

289.81 298.79 A: yeah [mn] and i suppose everybody kind of expects the president to be this wholesome wonderful person and [mn] 

296.03 296.97 B: right 

299.12 304.10 A: they probably all did it [laughter] he just got caught you know what i'm saying 

301.05 304.97 B: [laughter] that's [laughter] that's what i mean 

304.78 306.09 A: yeah 

305.49 310.50 B: [laughter] i met him in person years ago when he was young and he was just a governor then 

306.17 307.04 A: he just 

310.33 311.38 A: oh really 

310.72 317.55 B: [mn] yeah and um he wa- he was quite the ladies' man you know he was really really nice to me when i met 

314.99 315.87 A: (( really )) 

317.37 325.91 B: him and it wasn't under the best of circumstances it wasn't as far as i was concerned but it was what i i had gotten into in a few days you know 

317.56 318.66 A: oh yeah 

325.52 326.60 A: (( ahah [laughter] )) 

326.03 326.99 B: (( and )) 

327.08 341.55 B: ah you know he asked me a bunch of questions and everything and i thought ooh dear you know but anyway everything went off well and ah actually he thanked me when we when we were finished talking and you know discussing ah certain things that he wanted to know 

335.93 336.67 A: (( oh )) 

341.50 342.37 A: huh 

341.89 344.08 B: and ah i found him very nice 

343.81 344.91 A: really 

344.70 345.75 B: mhm 

345.14 346.43 A: well i suppose 

346.05 348.56 B: (( but that was quite a few years ago [laughter] )) 

347.79 355.89 A: yeah well i think that's one of the reasons why he got [mn] you know elected in the first place is just the simple fact that he was so young and he was you know 

355.14 356.20 B: popular 

356.25 361.62 A: relatively handsome and charming and all that kind of they wanted another j._f._k. or whatever 

358.61 360.17 B: right 

360.36 362.75 B: yeah [laughter] 

362.39 363.08 A: but 

364.01 365.92 B: [laughter] so we kinda draw the line 

366.06 369.40 B: you know where um it's in bad taste 

368.50 370.67 A: [mn] yeah definitely 

369.74 371.32 B: and 

371.69 375.06 B: [mn] humor is fine we need humor in our lives 

375.79 376.99 B: but um 

377.53 379.46 B: we don't need that kind 

380.31 388.91 A: [mn] well no i mean if it's going to hurt somebody's feelings or if it's gonna you know if its gonna do something that's gonna be detrimental to the person there's certainly no reason for it 

389.28 393.19 B: well you know when other people hear something over and over again 

389.49 390.34 A: or 

393.20 401.55 B: a lot of times you know they begin to accept it even if they didn't in the beginning after they hear all these [mn] you know this bad taste humor 

401.44 402.17 A: (( mm )) 

401.58 405.33 B: i mean then they begin to like accept it you know 

404.73 405.77 A: mhm 

405.83 407.06 B: as a result 

408.16 409.83 A: [mn] well that's why i brought up 

410.46 416.75 A: eddie murphy i don't know if you remember when eddie murphy raw came out when they taped that stand- that particular 

417.44 420.70 A: time he had a tape out called eddie murphy raw 

421.05 426.50 B: no i i probably didn't because i really wasn't interested in it you know [laughter] 

421.31 422.13 A: (( and it )) 

426.27 432.47 A: well i was i was a kid during that time and i swear it wa- everybody quoted that 

428.38 429.55 B: (( yeah )) 

432.12 432.94 B: (( ahah )) 

432.49 434.34 A: that tape and 

435.62 442.30 A: i always thought it was disgusting i never really liked it but i mean my husband grew up you know he's the same age as me and 

442.45 451.27 A: i mean even he will catch himself quoting from that stinking tape and he thinks it's okay and it's just like it's not so i totally understand what you mean 

446.34 447.71 B: [laughter] 

451.03 452.04 B: right 

451.89 457.77 A: you know some people think at first that it's bad taste and then ooh after a while [mn] it's not so bad 

457.06 463.14 B: that's what i mean after they hear it so long and everything you know i- it it's like they adopt it after that [laughter] 

462.82 464.31 A: yeah 

463.80 468.12 B: not everyone but you know generally speaking people do 

465.72 467.16 A: (( well some people do )) 

467.90 471.73 A: yeah yeah it's weird [laughter] 

471.27 471.91 B: (( [laughter] )) 

472.02 473.13 A: (( but )) 

473.03 479.33 B: so what do you listen to now ah that is in good taste ah i don't watch too much t._v. but

519.50 520.32 B: (( oh )) 

520.10 529.17 A: [mn] yeah that's it is totally clean but at the same time it's you know it's just a bunch of kids growing up in the seventies in wisconsin of all places 

528.61 530.12 B: (( ahah huh )) 

529.40 539.56 A: and um [laughter] it's just it's just goofy [mn] so yeah that's a really funny show otherwise i don't really get to watch t._v. very often so
