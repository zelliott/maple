9.47 10.82 A: i guess so 

10.30 15.51 B: [laughter] okay um i think inappropriate comedy would be 

11.08 12.31 A: [laughter] 

15.77 20.86 B: um [sigh] something of sensitive to everybody 

20.96 25.87 B: not um in well not just that but i i think even singling out just one particular

29.26 30.89 A: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

30.93 35.87 A: i think inappropriate comedy is jerry springer show [laughter]

38.01 43.39 A: [laughter] i i don't enjoy that i d- i don't even watch it 

43.58 45.93 A: but of course i know people who do

46.77 47.62 A: but 

48.53 51.29 A: yeah [laughter] yeah 

51.55 57.83 B: um i also think that it depends on what your generation is to determine inappropriate comedy 

57.30 59.50 A: oh that's true too yeah 

58.28 64.56 B: and i think that people in their teens and twenties would think the jerry springer show was excellent entertainment 

64.41 66.91 A: yeah they think different than i do 

68.12 71.60 B: i think inappropriate comedy is something my children can't watch with me

108.46 109.40 A: oh 

111.48 113.41 A: okay [laughter]

145.46 146.70 A: mhm 

146.14 151.34 B: jay leno i think was funnier when he was guest hosting the tonight show rather than when he was in charge 

151.16 152.35 A: oh 

152.71 155.23 A: i only started watching it 

155.28 162.51 A: well i don't watch it steady but since i retired i had to get up to go to work and i couldn't stay awake that late 

162.23 163.34 B: (( [laughter] )) 

163.34 167.96 A: but now i [laughter] fall asleep [laughter] in fact i'd just fallen asleep when the uh 

168.05 169.47 A: the phone rang 

171.02 174.86 B: my first thought was why's the phone ringing that late oh yeah 

173.76 175.30 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

175.95 179.07 B: um let's see what else uh 

178.04 182.01 A: most of my phone calls have come late this late so mhm 

184.87 189.45 A: [lipsmack] uh i don't think women can comedians are as funny as men 

185.12 185.69 B: (( [noise] )) 

189.89 191.79 B: not usually and they're not 

191.88 197.53 B: they're not very well accepted i don't think and when a woman comedian does something bad it seems to 

197.58 202.25 B: uh stick in people's minds a lot longer than if a if a male does something 

201.35 204.12 A: yeah like uh phyllis diller [laughter] [laughter] 

203.54 205.28 B: yeah yeah 

205.99 207.43 B: or um

219.97 221.42 A: oh oh what's her name 

221.05 222.68 B: paula poundstone 

222.53 229.41 A: oh okay yeah um i heard something about it but honestly i don't remember about it 

229.58 231.28 A: (( about what it was mhm )) 

233.74 235.60 A: i just recognized the name 

237.14 240.03 B: [lipsmack] and i can't think of any of the comedy that she did 

241.78 243.13 A: (( i can't either )) 

243.56 245.09 B: this is my first call 

245.08 246.50 A: oh is it 

246.95 253.30 B: i got lots of attempts while i was on vacation but i wasn't here to take them so i didn't think i would get another call it's been a month 

252.77 256.93 A: oh mhm ooh you know we only get three calls don't we 

254.23 255.32 B: (( uh )) 

256.66 259.15 B: yeah yeah it's just three 

257.42 259.78 A: uh-huh this is my third call 

259.79 261.12 B: this is your first 

261.00 262.09 A: third 

261.74 263.01 B: it's your third 

262.43 263.51 A: uh-huh 

263.79 266.27 B: um what other topics did you talk about 

266.28 270.59 A: oh about the war which was interesting yeah 

268.09 269.11 B: really 

271.22 275.45 A: and uh i don't remember the first one it's been a while 

277.16 278.99 A: (( uh i don't remember )) 

280.02 284.01 A: (( [mn] sorry but i'm falling asleep [laughter] )) 

282.18 283.89 B: [laughter] 

284.83 287.96 B: oh [sigh] i'll still be awake for a couple more hours 

287.98 292.19 B: um i do mystery shopping which is how i got started doing this 

292.55 294.36 A: oh that's interesting 

294.11 301.25 B: and so there was a bunch of uh talk about people that didn't think they were going to be paid for these calls but several have been paid so 

301.32 303.70 B: faith is restored i suppose 

303.52 304.73 A: oh 

304.55 307.22 B: and that in itself is comedy 

306.53 308.23 A: when do you get paid 

308.52 321.67 B: uh er they um pay once per month and evidently they had such a huge amount of checks that they had to get somebody from outside the university to process the checks and so it took longer than they anticipated 

321.07 322.35 A: i see mhm 

323.79 325.87 A: that's comedy [laughter] 

325.23 332.95 B: isn't it isn't that great i mean well you would think that they would have an idea of how many checks they would have to cut because they know how many calls they're making 

326.65 327.71 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

332.74 334.20 A: (( mhm )) 

333.48 335.55 B: so that ought to be something they know 

335.57 336.71 B: pretty much 

336.78 337.68 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

336.98 339.22 B: almost exactly i would think 

340.56 343.52 A: do you remember um [lipsmack] 

343.69 346.22 A: you probably don't if you're younger 

346.34 350.39 A: lou uh costello abbott and costello 

348.79 351.10 B: yeah abbott and costello 

350.49 353.47 A: they were funny in their day 

352.17 355.78 B: who's who's on first [laughter] 

354.25 358.62 A: i know yeah i had seen um 

358.55 371.00 A: their movie hit the ice and at the time it was just the funniest movie i had ever seen well then i saw a repeat of it oh 

371.28 376.42 A: i don't know how long ago ten or fifteen years ago it wasn't nearly as funny 

376.76 380.31 A: as i had remembered the first time seeing it 

380.44 381.58 A: but um 

382.00 385.40 A: i i that that really was comedy [laughter] 

385.27 390.60 B: i really like the the shows like um carey grant did arsenic and old lace 

390.62 399.96 B: and i remember watching this in um in english class and it was just hilarious and i've watched it several times since and each time i think it's funny 

399.87 401.19 A: (( uh-huh oh )) 

401.68 409.78 B: um and there was another one the importance of being ernest which everything was a play on words and ernest was his name but he also had to be earnest 

409.74 414.28 A: oh oh and that would be like who's on first huh [laughter] 

409.80 411.83 B: and now he had to 

412.59 423.07 B: yes and it was it was just the most wonderful show and we just laughed all through it and then had to write a report got graded on how well had we paid attention 

418.18 419.29 A: mhm 

423.75 426.54 B: what what were some of the ironies in the show 

427.01 435.96 B: and i thought that that was something that anybody could watch and you didn't have to have a great vocabulary to watch it and laugh at a lot of it 

435.80 437.26 A: (( uh-huh uh-huh oh i )) 

437.81 440.66 B: so that was something that would have been appropriate for everybody 

438.19 442.82 A: don't i never saw that we never saw movies in school [laughter] 

442.10 443.99 B: you didn't get to watch movies in school 

443.54 445.90 A: no no uh-uh 

446.25 454.09 B: that was one of the perks of being a good english student you did all your work at the beginning of the week and the last couple of days there was nothing for you to do so it was like a study hall 

446.55 447.40 A: (( we didn't )) 

454.15 455.24 A: uh-huh 

459.84 462.32 A: mhm oh what else about comedy huh 

461.64 463.36 B: um [sigh] 

463.79 466.35 B: [lipsmack] i don't like carrot top 

466.41 467.86 B: he's annoying 

467.87 470.18 A: [laughter] okay 

470.19 474.70 B: have you seen his m._c._i. commercials or a._t. and t i don't even know who he does any more 

474.49 477.14 A: i don't even know who he is [laughter] 

476.11 482.08 B: he's he's got the scary orange hair and he does some of the some of the phone commercials 

481.61 482.98 A: uh-huh 

482.19 483.24 B: for the 

483.26 486.34 B: like one eight hundred collect or er i think that's uh 

486.68 488.33 B: and i don't think he's funny 

488.50 489.67 B: (( i think he's )) 

488.51 490.04 A: oh [laughter] 

490.72 493.10 B: he was he was uh 

491.70 495.08 A: we'll check him off our list huh [laughter] 

493.58 497.03 B: yeah he was embraced i think because he was just so 

497.14 500.69 B: odd at the time but now everybody is 

498.57 499.63 A: (( [lipsmack] uh-huh mhm ))
