86.29 87.27 A: mhm 

87.85 88.67 A: right

96.39 97.13 B: (( ah )) 

99.81 103.65 A: does it have to be off color does it have to be 

103.73 109.41 A: um making yeah making other people uncomfortable um

116.09 117.08 B: (( i )) 

118.03 119.44 B: as a woman 

119.66 124.18 B: get uncomfortable with comedy when i feel that it's denigrating 

126.57 138.65 B: denigrating me and other women um for no specific reason other than oh you know women we're just not very smart or something general like that 

135.65 136.88 A: mhm

159.74 164.46 B: i'm trying to think about other humor that i find offensive um 

166.85 171.14 B: i suppose humor that one might say falls 

172.04 176.41 B: in the range of political incorrectness 

176.35 177.48 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

177.82 178.79 B: (( um ))

206.65 208.35 B: (( [laughter] ah okay )) 

207.76 210.84 A: [laughter] that's a little bit of humor 

210.55 211.59 B: (( uh-huh )) 

211.07 213.38 A: [laughter] um 

214.07 221.25 A: but any anti female jokes um i'm kind of a staunch feminist um 

217.38 218.20 B: yeah 

219.73 220.35 B: (( mm )) 

221.48 223.56 A: any anti

235.23 236.24 A: um 

236.34 237.66 A: (( puns )) 

237.89 243.46 A: um just something that makes you think not that's very broad 

243.08 244.60 B: mhm 

244.83 250.04 A: so as to what offends me it's the anti jokes um 

250.07 261.05 A: and within that category are the off color jokes that are made against [sigh] um i- i- what it comes down to is against women 

260.63 267.18 B: [sigh] you know don't make anybody feel bad [laughter] whether they're listening or not 

263.72 264.40 A: [laughter]

284.71 285.85 B: comedy 

286.21 288.35 B: (( [laughter] )) 

288.58 289.99 B: i guess 

291.02 295.22 B: it's just not a subject i really think about that much 

294.59 295.44 A: right 

295.24 296.59 B: um 

296.55 299.97 A: comedy to me is witty lines on west wing 

300.24 301.07 A: [laughter] 

300.45 301.57 B: witty what 

301.34 302.91 A: witty lines 

302.32 303.34 B: (( oh okay )) 

302.95 304.42 A: (( on west wing )) 

303.79 310.71 B: yeah oh i was going to say that but i thought yeah but you know that's not really a comedy it's kind of 

306.55 307.86 A: [laughter] 

310.79 317.55 B: a drama but yeah west wing is bar none the best written show on television 

312.01 313.80 A: oh yeah yeah 

317.02 320.17 A: right and their comedy i mean 

319.44 320.22 B: uh-huh 

320.36 326.35 A: [laughter] and i and you're right you can't really call it comedy but some things are very comical 

325.80 326.70 B: right 

326.60 333.03 A: and and it is the writing but that's good comedy to me and good drama 

328.83 329.99 B: mhm 

331.33 332.19 B: yeah 

333.02 335.78 B: yeah i would absolutely buy that 

335.16 336.23 A: mhm 

336.35 337.45 B: um 

337.19 342.17 A: but when i was younger i used to be quite a radical well not a radical 

341.68 342.71 B: uh-huh 

342.39 346.13 A: um and i liked um 

346.38 349.29 A: comedians and comedy 

349.49 351.38 A: more comedians 

350.97 351.92 B: okay

374.96 379.91 A: um i i really enjoyed them i still do to this day

383.79 385.02 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

384.82 388.56 A: maybe it's just growing up i don't know [laughter] 

387.96 390.50 B: [laughter] yeah i don't know um 

391.50 392.54 B: but 

393.71 397.35 B: i guess i went through enough years of being 

397.36 398.47 B: um 

399.57 401.69 B: picky and 

401.70 404.15 B: a political correctness nazi

413.32 415.66 B: really staunch 

416.69 418.38 B: in my views 

417.76 418.76 A: mhm 

418.76 422.81 B: but yeah you know i think 

423.91 429.07 B: it would be really tough for me to think of a comedian who i find funny 

428.47 429.93 A: mhm 

429.43 430.56 B: um 

432.05 433.55 B: anyhow i 

433.37 436.30 A: and and comedy movies 

436.43 438.64 A: today aren't funny to me 

438.39 439.78 B: no [mn] 

439.23 440.29 A: um 

440.38 442.64 A: they used to be back the 

441.37 442.31 B: uh-huh 

443.09 445.15 A: thirties and fourties 

445.21 445.86 B: (( um )) 

445.23 447.36 A: some pretty funny things 

447.14 449.28 B: yeah i could see that 

449.72 450.64 B: (( but )) 

450.92 453.02 B: and i certainly had to watch 

453.16 455.55 B: those films in 

455.69 456.70 B: (( ah the )) 

456.80 461.22 B: history of the cinema classes you know like i do enjoy them 

459.12 460.13 A: mhm 

461.58 462.68 B: (( but [sigh] )) 

462.32 464.67 A: but then i was crazy for animal house 

464.58 465.55 B: okay 

465.03 469.12 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

466.54 467.85 B: um 

468.34 470.52 B: i guess maybe 

470.79 473.49 B: i can't really define 

473.75 474.71 B: what 

475.50 477.20 B: (( comedy is i )) 

477.06 478.19 A: mhm 

478.18 485.91 B: mean you say you're you were crazy about animal house and i'm thinking well what movies have i loved that really made me laugh 

485.42 486.82 A: mhm 

486.09 487.83 B: well certainly 

487.96 490.00 B: the john hughes flicks 

490.11 493.85 B: of the nineteen eighties like 

494.39 496.90 B: pretty in pink or you know those 

496.25 497.54 A: oh yeah 

497.05 499.40 B: films that had molly ringwald 

498.78 499.82 A: mhm 

499.54 500.41 B: (( you know )) 

500.09 501.30 A: mhm 

500.67 503.61 B: and i guess kind of like west wing 

503.76 506.07 B: not as well written but 

505.43 506.42 A: mhm 

506.47 509.09 B: they weren't as much about straight comedy 

508.73 509.55 A: right 

509.18 511.25 B: but more situational 

511.02 512.03 A: (( mhm )) 

512.21 513.36 A: that's right 

513.50 516.22 A: and that's probably why you like seinfeld too 

515.93 516.81 B: yeah 

516.75 521.66 A: his show and his standup are basically the same it's the same humor 

520.16 521.04 B: yeah 

521.32 522.60 B: absolutely 

522.20 523.19 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

523.85 528.17 B: so i think when they tell us that ten minutes are up and they ask for comments 

528.53 535.51 B: i would like to say ask the question a little more slowly and a little more clearly 

532.97 534.20 A: (( yeah )) 

534.91 536.02 A: yes 

537.28 538.32 B: (( ah )) 

538.94 540.46 B: (( that's how )) 

541.98 544.95 B: so how did you get involved with this 

548.48 551.99 B: exam or test or whatever upenn is doing 

551.80 555.61 A: um i just found it on the internet 

555.39 556.20 B: yeah 

556.58 558.71 A: and i thought well that sounds interesting 

558.41 559.31 B: yeah 

559.32 560.74 A: something to do with 

560.87 563.50 A: my in my four minutes of spare time every day 

563.07 564.40 B: yeah exactly 

563.55 565.08 A: [laughter] 

564.44 568.46 B: well you know you've got ten minutes and 

569.07 571.37 B: you know i found out about it through 

571.47 576.68 B: just a posting board where someone put this post up saying hey this is so cool 

576.20 577.46 A: mhm 

576.83 578.28 B: check this out 

577.68 578.67 A: yeah 

578.78 585.84 A: i suppose if you get a really interesting topic it would be good that's interesting to more than just one person 

583.18 584.14 B: yeah 

585.49 586.35 B: right 

587.09 591.10 B: and because i am currently unemployed 

590.94 591.54 A: (( [laughter] )) 

591.32 594.34 B: i have too much time on my hands anyway 

593.90 594.92 A: right 

595.17 596.91 B: but i think if i knew 

596.92 599.95 B: what this study was doing
