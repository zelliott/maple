0.00 1.75 B: hello this is renee 

1.41 3.56 A: hello renee this is mike king 

3.18 5.11 B: (( [lipsmack] hi nice to meet you )) 

4.76 5.59 A: hi 

5.31 6.60 B: um [lipsmack] 

6.72 14.15 B: uh do you think you would commit [noise] perjury for a close friend or family member i would 

14.27 16.16 A: would ya i i'd 

16.33 21.86 A: i think i might do it depends on circumstance but i i would i would try to m- usually not to 

22.17 26.29 B: but yeah i would try not to if there was a way to avoid it 

22.74 23.43 A: i 

26.15 37.70 B: then i would try to take that route first and depending on the circumstances around it like if the the family member [noise] or friend is something [noise] outright blatant wrong 

37.50 38.33 A: right 

37.65 42.66 B: and is trying to get out of it then no i'm not gonna help them 

42.86 43.71 A: (( [lipsmack] right )) 

42.93 54.89 B: but if you're just in a bad [noise] situation or let's say wrong place wrong time and you need a hand i don't see a problem with lending [laughter] a hand you know what i'm saying [noise] [mn] 

53.79 62.60 A: right yeah i think eh the circumstances definitely makes some difference with you know how serious a an offence it would be [lipsmack] and and whether or not you know they were 

62.58 69.85 A: clearly had done something major wrong i mean a- and those cases i don't think i would [lipsmack] ever you know say do perjury [mn] [noise] 

69.48 72.82 B: right exactly i wouldn't either and uh 

73.02 78.43 B: eh i think that i don't know i think that yeah i would do it i would do it 

78.54 82.38 B: for especially for a close friend because 

81.03 81.92 A: mhm 

82.69 87.18 B: sometimes your family has a tendency to say 

87.25 95.82 B: [lipsmack] well if i s- explain the situation like this because you're my blood you're supposed to do something 

95.73 96.68 A: mhm 

96.04 97.39 B: you see what i'm saying 

96.85 97.93 A: right 

97.43 109.86 B: but a friend a close friend you know that person and you're not blood related so it's like you're either gonna help me as a friend this is the situation this is what happened this is what it is 

109.70 117.14 B: but sometimes family members might have a tendency to kind of cover up a little few details you know what i'm saying 

114.29 115.78 A: [laughter] 

116.24 126.48 A: yeah yeah and i think sometimes your family members might expect you to to actually [sigh] do that for them just because you're family i think that would be a difficult i mean that would be 

123.82 125.00 B: (( [lipsmack] exactly )) 

126.50 138.45 A: difficult to be placed in that situation 'cause like i i said i think at first i would i would probably almost never try to commit perjury you know and and definitely for nothing serious i mean if it was something not serious or 

132.97 133.61 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

138.95 149.89 A: a misdemeanor or something it was just a stupid mistake you know you might help somebody out but er but if it was like you know murder or something real serious then you know i i could never see myself perjuring you know saying 

142.94 143.89 B: right 

149.03 150.52 B: exactly 

150.20 152.12 A: saying something that wasn't true 

151.90 153.67 B: yeah that's true [noise] 

153.08 164.87 A: or saying the person was with me or something to give them an alibi but but i could see where if it was something simple you know like i'm trying to think [laughter] what would be er but if something real simple y- you know i could see helping 

159.02 160.14 B: right 

164.90 176.73 B: and see i look at i've i've looked at it like like you said based upon the crime because if you have a person who is a thief 

164.95 166.28 A: out a family member 

170.37 171.32 A: mhm 

176.55 177.61 A: (( mhm mhm [noise] )) 

177.02 181.24 B: and i i've i've talked about this many times if you have a person who is a thief 

181.37 188.41 B: (( and they're getting away with a sentence for a sentence to jail for about [noise] say ten years estimation )) 

187.12 188.06 A: mhm 

188.46 189.36 A: right 

188.74 194.13 B: and it's a close friend or family member and i have a choice to either 

194.18 198.89 B: helping you get over your problem after we get out of the situation 

198.71 199.57 A: mhm 

198.92 200.69 B: and helping you with 

200.61 208.46 B: you know the stop stealing part or sending you with people who are multi 

208.38 221.89 B: multi killers you know [laughter] what i'm saying mass murderers and take a chance on you not coming out a thief any more but coming out a murderer i think i would have to give serious consideration to that 

210.51 211.46 A: mhm 

212.01 212.91 A: right 

216.55 217.57 A: (( [lipsmack] right [lipsmack] )) 

221.91 223.19 B: (( you know what i'm saying )) 

222.80 224.97 A: r- right i understand what you're saying 'cause uh 

224.23 233.54 B: 'cause i i i don't think i would want to send a friend or a family member like you said who committed just a stu- a little simple stupid mistake 

225.85 227.02 A: (( [cough] )) 

233.34 234.39 A: mhm 

233.67 240.72 B: with to be in the setting in an environment with people who have committed totally 

240.57 241.34 A: right 

241.27 245.57 B: massive wrong things i don't think i would be able to do that 

243.17 244.07 A: right 

245.39 259.65 A: [lipsmack] yeah i understand i think i would probably face the same [laughter] you know especially if you know it's if it's a close friend or if it's a [lipsmack] a close you know family member that you care about you know it'd be r- [sigh] i think in those cases it'd be real tempting to 

248.82 249.56 B: yeah 

255.53 256.51 B: right 

257.15 258.05 B: right 

259.78 263.28 A: to definitely say whatever you could that would help them to get free 

262.89 274.11 B: right 'cause me personally i have a personal experience of a family member of mine that had made a minor little mistake that person stole a car 

266.16 267.13 A: mhm 

268.72 269.62 A: mhm 

273.85 274.92 A: mhm 

274.66 279.07 B: and it was either say 

280.01 287.21 B: you know eh this person was with me at the particular time or it was let the person go to jail 

286.98 288.06 A: (( [lipsmack] right )) 

287.47 296.24 B: but at that particular time i was like well you know you made the mistake you've got you do the the crime you gotta do the time 

292.85 293.71 A: mhm 

295.92 297.18 A: mhm 

296.70 300.54 B: but then they wind up sentencing this person to ten years 

300.28 301.28 A: mhm 

300.82 304.86 B: and now when i when i speak to this family member 

305.25 317.76 B: he's always saying about how he's surrounded by people by rapists and killers and and things like that and he just stole a car so now there's a possibility 

311.54 312.26 A: (( mm [lipsmack] )) 

314.93 315.73 A: right 

317.61 329.42 B: that he's gonna come out because of that s- one simple time that i didn't say yeah he was with me now he might come out a rapist or a killer or something like that all because he stole a car 

329.24 335.54 B: and he couldn't have a little perjury involved [laughter] you know what i'm saying [lipsmack] so i i've been [noise] [noise] [noise] 

331.93 333.14 A: (( right right )) 

333.44 338.31 A: no i can understand that that would make you have second thoughts so like i s- like i said like i said before i 

338.37 340.93 A: kind of thought that i would probably really never say 

341.26 348.81 A: you know i'd never give someone an excuse that they did something was fairly a serious you know type of you know like stealing a car or doing something but uh 

348.82 351.60 A: you do have to think about what the outcome would be 

351.16 353.36 B: right right exactly 

351.67 352.68 A: (( you know to )) 

352.73 365.01 A: to the person if they're a young person and make a mistake and they end up getting in hard time in prison and they and everybody they're dealing with is [sigh] like you said people that are killers and rapists and things that would be very difficult to 

357.16 358.76 B: right exactly [noise] 

365.12 370.37 A: think that you know because you didn't help them that's what happened that would be very tough [lipsmack] [mn] 

367.63 369.60 B: exactly exactly 

369.85 377.65 B: so that that that really made me give serious thought to to that whole topic i was like if i could've just said that one thing 

373.05 374.13 A: mhm 

377.75 382.84 B: yeah and that person wouldn't been in this situation from the beginning you know but 

380.98 382.33 A: (( [lipsmack] right [lipsmack] )) 

382.98 387.62 B: still i mean the person is wrong for whatever they did wrong 

387.54 388.36 A: right 

387.75 393.52 B: but if there's some kind of way that you can get them out of that situation and then get them help 

393.34 394.17 A: right 

393.54 399.79 B: in a different direction like maybe counselling or something like that i think that would be 

399.86 406.17 B: a better solution than just letting the person just go all the way down you know 

405.36 412.56 A: [lipsmack] right oh i definitely think you're right if you know if you if you can get the person to to agree to do something 

412.22 413.31 B: (( right [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

412.67 413.92 A: like that then 

413.98 419.59 A: i mean probably saying something that would help them not go to ja- to jail in that case would've been a much better 

419.21 420.33 B: right 

419.76 429.52 A: solution but i think it's really it's really hard 'cause you don't sometimes know you know when you're called on to say something you know what what are going to be the results to the person 

429.34 430.35 B: right 

429.86 431.68 A: 'cause 'cause sometime i guess it 

431.65 445.03 A: depends on the states i know in some states that they only three strikes or three mistakes and you go to jail with no way to get out and that's you have to really think about what's your [lipsmack] you know what the consequences to the person is and if it's your family 

438.79 439.86 B: (( [noise] right mhm )) 

445.21 452.13 A: or close friend it would be [sigh] i would have to admit it would be very easy to want to say something so they didn't face that kind of situation 

451.80 453.47 B: right right mm 

452.74 455.46 A: [lipsmack] especially with ten years of hard time with 

455.62 464.00 A: people like i can see if you had an experience like that that would definitely [laughter] that would definitely make you think about [laughter] uh this whole eh question and how you're gonna answer it 'cause you mm 

460.67 461.71 B: right 

462.95 471.11 B: now if they had the the the court system and the jail system set out whereas though if you are a 

471.07 485.34 B: crook by stealing like cash and checks that's not yours you go to this prison and people that are murderers you go to this prison and people that do other things you go to this prison based upon your crime then no 

475.38 476.20 A: right 

483.95 484.89 A: mhm 

485.49 488.15 B: i have to say no i will not commit perjury 

487.79 489.30 A: (( [noise] right )) 

488.62 501.07 B: [lipsmack] because if i got a whole bunch of a jail full of people who have falsified checks then they're not getting influenced by people who are killers 

495.62 496.53 A: mhm 

500.47 501.58 A: (( [lipsmack] right )) 

501.01 509.26 B: you see what i'm saying so in that instance no i wouldn't but since we had don't have the system set up like that [noise] then yes i think i would [laughter] [noise] 

502.34 503.07 A: right 

508.59 514.79 A: yeah i think the system is that it's just enough overcrowding and there are probably way too many prisons that 

513.25 516.16 B: right 'cause we really we create [noise] the criminals 

515.89 516.89 A: yeah 

516.28 517.27 B: we do 

517.44 529.37 A: unfortunately i think you're right [laughter] on that part that probably when you get young people and put them into a situation where they're around a lot of people that have done more criminal behaviour that you do cause a situation that would lead to 

523.91 526.67 B: (( [noise] [noise] [laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] right )) 

528.97 529.57 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

529.74 532.35 A: you know making it better not to send them there [laughter] 

531.53 533.28 B: right exactly 

532.66 541.81 A: i i could see where you know in that situation where you feel like you this exactly like you do and i guess if [cough] if i had a family member that was fac- or or a real close friend 

542.02 544.24 A: facing a situation like that i 

544.20 552.33 A: would have to admit i think my temptation would be to [lipsmack] to give them excuse or do something to protect them from going you know to a hardened 

550.66 551.30 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

552.28 562.05 A: you know place with criminals and stuff where they might turn out after ten years or so to want to go that to that lifestyle you'd definitely want to protect them from that there's no 

552.70 553.59 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

559.37 560.43 B: mhm 

562.05 569.13 A: you know i'm i'm thinking about my children anything you know you definitely you would [laughter] you you'd almost do anything to protect them from that type of situation [lipsmack] 

564.78 566.32 B: [noise] right exactly 

568.50 570.95 B: and young people are young 

570.87 571.67 A: yeah 

571.07 574.72 B: so they're granted [noise] mistakes automatically 

574.05 575.55 A: [laughter] 

574.72 578.72 B: i made mistakes plenty mistakes but 

577.10 579.31 A: [laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah i think so 

578.67 590.22 B: now that i'm older i wouldn't do those same things so because of the fact that people have bailed me out in the past i never got a opportunity to see hard time 

589.94 590.93 A: (( mhm mhm [lipsmack] )) 

590.46 597.28 B: but if i didn't have those people to bail me out then who knows the type of person that i would be today 

597.16 598.25 A: right 

597.51 599.95 B: you know what i'm saying now i have kids of my own
