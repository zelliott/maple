5.12 6.14 A: okay 

6.10 11.16 B: ah let's see acceptable humour versus not acceptable humour 

10.36 13.49 A: right well where do we draw the line at bad taste 

12.95 14.18 B: right 

14.23 17.94 B: ah this is an interesting topic what do you do for a living jim 

17.44 19.13 A: i'm an actor 

18.81 22.37 B: oh really i'm a publicist myself 

21.76 24.10 A: ah wh- wh- what part of the country are you in 

24.20 25.12 B: l._a. 

24.83 26.44 A: l._a. i'm in new york 

25.96 27.40 B: oh cool 

26.70 28.77 A: okay coast to coast call huh 

28.15 29.81 B: yeah 

29.90 33.13 A: (( um i don't [mn] it's ah [sigh] )) 

30.25 31.28 B: (( ah )) 

33.36 37.68 A: i i i i actually sort of enjoy things that sort of 

37.73 40.91 A: push the envelope pretty far i guess um 

40.12 41.01 B: (( mhm )) 

41.25 47.19 A: um i mean that's sort of that's generally m- my take on comedy i mean ah you know f- for for instance um 

47.31 56.64 A: yeah i was just watching ah i was just watching a sort of an old old episode of saturday night live and i was thinking about how in the old days well you know twenty years ago 

51.99 52.90 B: uh-huh 

56.47 64.95 A: ah a lot of what they did was sort of right on the edge of bad taste but it was so good and so hilarious and also so ah 

64.98 67.69 A: relevant and and and ah 

67.84 78.69 A: and cutting and necessary and you know today you watch that same show and and it's so seldom that anything is is at all you know th- there's hardly anything interesting or new on the show 

77.65 78.58 B: mhm 

78.64 92.27 B: well i think that's a good point because it was so close to the edge of what would be considered bad taste that it was actually good but the way they did it was so fantastic that it became good material 

87.07 88.25 A: mhm 

91.68 93.21 A: right right 

92.33 97.33 B: you know and today there's just nobody who's even trying to do that anymore 

96.87 98.29 A: right right 

97.73 102.45 B: you know they don't take it anywhere they just leave it everybody's a chicken person 

102.48 109.30 A: yeah yeah and people seem to be afraid of sort of ah very often especially in in ah in sort of mass media i guess outside of ah 

103.62 104.55 B: (( you know )) 

109.51 113.26 A: maybe actual theater people are seem to be um 

113.32 117.77 A: wary of sort of going too far um too often it seems 

115.66 116.68 B: yeah 

117.99 119.04 A: um 

119.50 125.12 B: too much money's involved they won't wanna take a risk because they're afraid they'll lose their job 

120.94 122.07 A: yeah 

124.85 134.29 A: yeah i suppose that that that's true i mean i know ah i spent i spent some time in in los angeles and that's sort of in terms of the industry out there it sort of felt that it sort of ran on fear 

130.77 133.22 B: hm 

134.16 135.25 B: yeah 

134.57 135.66 A: um 

135.97 141.78 A: and you know and it's interesting how ah [mn] you know in terms of comedy and and ah 

141.66 153.30 A: other things as well how sort of more interesting ah daring stuff of course isn't on the networks 'cause it's on h._b._o. and and those sort of things course they don't have to answer to sponsors so much but um 

148.50 149.41 B: right 

153.58 163.91 A: [lipsmack] i try to think of anything that that i've seen or or read or in terms of comedy that that i felt sort of went over the line and was in bad taste 

162.20 163.04 B: well 

163.55 172.21 B: we just went over the old versus say ah dysfunctional family or whatever that was 

172.46 176.26 B: the movie starring arlen jones a while back 

176.50 177.99 A: i don't remember this 

178.09 181.02 B: it was a comedy concert movie 

181.84 183.81 A: hm no i don't remember this 

183.50 187.35 B: ah it was all up and down garbage 

186.00 187.69 A: (( hm )) 

187.60 195.07 B: he was just so bad and ragging on everybody or an even worse better bet would be malibu's most wanted 

191.42 192.22 A: (( ha )) 

194.51 203.09 A: ah right well yeah okay there you are i guess that that's another sort of yeah yeah i bet that kind of stuff so some of the reality stuff well th- that's true i suppose ah 

198.95 200.02 B: yeah 

203.25 214.49 A: you know looking at watching some of these some of these daytime shows also um you know the the jerry springer kind of things um where they're clearly going for the comedy um 

206.59 207.52 B: (( mhm )) 

208.98 209.85 B: yeah 

214.93 217.35 A: it's just it's just um 

217.53 231.63 A: you know it wh- whenever i i'm feeling um i feeling sort of depressed in any way i just head to turn on that you know those kind of shows and see how well off i am compared to you know and i guess that's sort of bad taste and sort of showing people in in pretty 

225.27 226.16 B: yeah 

231.39 237.12 A: (( pretty desperate situations and um um i guess it sort of depends on how you how you ah )) 

233.20 234.14 B: yeah 

237.31 243.24 A: how you define it or or ah how broad or narrow ah your definition is of it 

239.16 240.13 B: yeah 

242.92 244.19 B: (( yeah well it )) 

245.00 255.35 B: it's i pretty much think that the line in drawn when it's just so bad it has you walking out of the theater or turning the channel or 

254.96 257.11 A: mhm mhm 

256.47 260.46 B: you know there's a craft to comedy and good 

261.01 266.90 B: there's a difference between good humour and bad humour and you know 

266.60 268.37 A: yeah yeah 

267.85 274.49 B: i mean laurel and hardy had it down pat and a lot of people today would think they were just 

275.38 279.72 B: so over the top and bad taste but they were in their day 

279.33 280.78 A: right right 

281.02 285.19 A: also in a way i guess it is it is ah truly a ah ah a 

285.32 288.31 A: matter of personal taste in many ways 

286.77 287.96 B: yeah 

288.38 289.35 A: um 

290.03 294.12 A: ah i mean i i remember the well there was a movie out out just recently um [lipsmack] 

294.70 306.42 A: barber shop i guess it was right and where they were they were the one of the characters i ah i don't know it must be one of the characters was was bad mouthing martin luther king and a lot of the the sort of the ah 

295.90 297.11 B: yeah 

303.99 304.94 B: uh-huh 

306.47 312.41 A: leaders of the civil rights and civil right movement and people really were up in arms about that and i suppose they would 

311.77 312.83 B: mhm 

312.21 321.53 A: say that was in bad taste and um you know there's the argument that you know free speech is free speech and you know you don't need to watch it i guess but um 

317.93 318.94 B: right 

322.51 328.12 A: yeah and there's tho- what those those late those movies um what was that movie jackass i guess would've 

327.48 329.30 B: yeah please 

328.48 330.96 A: been which i didn't see but i mean 

330.92 332.03 B: yeah 

331.42 339.01 A: but i guess it's sort of like what you're saying you know that some things that you just don't even wanna watch and you just you know [mn] that that that's bad taste i guess yeah 

335.35 336.18 B: (( right )) 

337.39 344.97 B: yeah it's i mean it's just the way they did it on saturday night live was they made it good 

344.25 345.76 A: mhm 

345.13 355.52 B: they actually made it good but the you know i mean come on jousting polar bears or what ever they did on jackass 

354.90 356.91 A: (( oh is that oh jeeze )) 

357.49 360.22 A: did did did did you did you actually see the movie 

359.57 362.38 B: ah i saw the commercials 

361.69 363.25 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

363.28 368.92 B: you know they got a guy kicking his face guys running down on bicycles for 

369.09 376.79 B: um extreme jousting or whatever the hell the call it and you know people pushing panda bears through 

372.47 373.15 A: (( mm )) 

373.18 373.89 A: (( mm )) 

376.80 380.24 B: hu- ah supermarkets i mean come on 

379.86 381.71 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

382.20 383.13 B: (( you know )) 

382.51 386.72 A: yeah yeah well again that way you know they're sort of trying to ah 

387.18 395.55 A: try to be new and and sort of show us something that maybe hasn't been seen before but if it doesn't if it's not funny and it's just sort of 

395.75 396.65 B: yeah 

395.78 399.16 A: sort of almost really for just like a shock value um 

398.30 400.01 B: (( yeah )) 

399.41 401.52 A: without any comedy to it um 

401.62 405.50 B: yeah you get enough shock on the news you need comedy for comedy 

401.69 402.47 A: (( i'm gonna )) 

405.19 409.83 A: right right yeah um 

410.10 412.02 A: i i guess there should be 

412.25 417.93 A: just trying to think that like you know when the last time i was sort of like offended by something 

418.04 420.30 A: that i've seen that was supposed to be comedy 

419.98 420.84 B: uh-huh 

420.38 421.42 A: um 

422.49 424.80 A: i don't know and i guess in new york ah 

425.11 434.76 A: i'm sure in l._a. the same the thing ah any major city you sort of um you're more accepting of of more forms of of things i suppose 

429.43 430.46 B: mhm 

434.39 435.90 B: right 

434.83 438.89 A: you know than if you're in the middle of the country somewhere but um 

439.75 449.69 A: i don't know i can't think of anything that i've that i've i don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing ah ah i guess it probably means that maybe people aren't really being all that that daring in a way but [mn] 

448.35 451.93 B: well yeah i mean i haven't really seen 

451.95 459.57 B: good comedy just quote unquote good comedy in a long time except for street performers to be honest with 

458.22 462.07 A: hm wh- wh- wh- what kind you mean like like stand ups 

462.41 464.85 B: stand up or 

465.45 467.27 B: ah they do 

467.89 473.53 B: there's this one guy named twirly dee he does a basketball routine on ah third street promenade out here 

472.93 473.99 A: (( mm uh-huh )) 

474.19 478.44 B: and he's just telling jokes and twirling basketballs 

477.63 478.83 A: (( mm mm )) 

478.90 486.24 B: you know a lot of people would think i mean come on you know you gotta tip the dancing bear or what have you but he does a good job 

483.86 484.97 A: yeah 

485.69 487.08 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

486.94 489.43 B: you know he's actually very funny 

488.66 491.11 A: mhm and he he gathers a good crowd 

490.90 494.60 B: yeah and 

492.53 493.19 A: mm 

495.06 502.92 B: you would think it's in bad taste because it's out on the street but he's one of the best performers since chevy chase i've ever seen 

502.55 504.15 A: (( ha ha )) 

505.13 509.98 A: once again well hopefully he you know i i guess being right down there in santa monica you would imagine that 

510.34 516.53 A: enough people would see him that s- some- s- some- you know like the right person would see him to sort of ah you know 

515.34 518.47 B: yeah somebody should pick him up and put him on the network 

517.85 519.27 A: you'd think 

518.77 521.80 B: yeah better than anything on now 

521.60 528.70 A: what kind of stuff what kind of comedy do you do you do you like i mean do you have you found that that you've enjoyed recently i guess

547.84 551.68 B: i've got a couple of friends in the industry that try to be funny but 

551.14 559.45 A: are you talking about like stand up stand up comics pretty much mhm mhm well that that's well that's a hard it gotta be a hard gig um 

553.26 554.08 B: yeah 

559.77 573.90 A: i mean there's nothing more painful i have a few friends that that that do it and ah there's nothing more painful than being in an audience when a comic is trying to be funny and he's not you know or or and when he just dying up there on stage it's just oh man 

566.14 568.94 B: (( um )) 

569.78 570.67 B: (( mhm yeah ))
