27.49 29.41 A: okay [laughter] 

28.58 30.39 B: [laughter] 

29.94 33.99 A: so would you like to give your opinion on that first [noise] [noise] 

31.23 32.11 B: [noise] 

33.47 39.37 B: um well i have a very very healthy sense of humor 

39.55 41.78 B: but um 

42.70 48.19 B: i suppose when it comes to some topical things like 

48.49 51.57 B: you know just horrendous things i'm sure there were even 

51.65 64.55 B: tasteless jokes going around nine eleven during the war and stuff and if somebody starts a joke like that i tell them you know don't 'cause i just don't even want to hear anything somethings i just can't find the humor in it 

62.85 63.79 A: right 

64.20 65.16 A: right 

64.86 68.67 B: most things i can find humor in but um 'cause i worked 

68.92 72.21 B: um a lot in medical records so 

71.25 72.18 A: uh-huh 

72.22 77.24 B: you know you kind of get a warped sense of humor [noise] you know [noise] 

76.97 80.51 A: well i've never really sat there and tried to [cough] 

80.71 90.72 A: analyze why something will strike me as something that you shouldn't joke about versus something that it's okay to make a joke about 

86.84 87.81 B: right 

90.05 91.07 B: mhm 

90.85 91.87 A: um 

92.61 94.84 A: but i do find that i 

94.94 99.29 A: that i have opinions about that such as um 

99.55 101.28 A: i don't think it's funny 

101.33 102.32 A: you know 

102.44 110.38 A: to make jokes about like there there's this whole strand of of humor on the internet about killing babies for example 

110.10 111.06 B: oh 

110.47 113.20 A: for some reason that doesn't strike me as funny 

112.81 113.74 B: no 

113.30 117.66 A: and i don't really care for it [laughter] and then there's this um 

113.84 116.03 B: no [laughter] no 

118.43 120.37 A: i don't like jokes about 

121.03 124.63 A: i don't like sacrilegious jokes too much 

123.18 125.00 B: right right 

124.82 129.85 A: and i guess that's because my in my upbringing i was brought up you know to respect 

129.99 132.53 A: um that 

132.49 145.20 A: aspect of life you know i respect everybody's religious beliefs but somehow i don't it real funny when they start making sac- what i would c- de- uh define as sacrilegious jokes 

133.81 134.87 B: mhm 

144.75 145.70 B: right 

145.81 146.54 B: (( right [noise] )) 

146.01 147.87 A: um [cough] 

148.58 155.36 A: or jokes about people that have terminal illnesses or jokes about retarded people 

155.09 156.35 B: right well 

155.63 162.27 A: there's like another whole strand of jokes about retarded people i don't care for that [laughter] too much [laughter] 

160.88 173.18 B: oh i must i must be really out of the loop here in fort wayne because i haven't i haven't heard any of those bad jokes of course i get a lot of things like if it's the joke of the day i delete them a lot before i even go there um 

173.57 180.85 A: for some reason even though i'm a female uh jokes that degrade women or make kind of like 

181.00 181.98 A: um 

183.18 189.86 A: derogatory comments about women sometimes i find those very funny now those don't those don't bother me 

187.05 188.00 B: mhm 

189.45 190.92 B: right yeah uh 

189.93 193.34 A: i guess maybe it's because at heart i don't have an issue 

193.81 199.01 A: with with those topics you know what i mean whereas the other topics are in fact 

196.18 197.13 B: right 

199.27 202.81 A: s- are sensitive topics for some reason or another with me 

202.60 216.37 B: right well just like blonde jokes it's like well i'm not blonde but i find them funny i have a lot of blonde friends and so uh they're usually the first ones i send them to and they always take it in the spirit it's meant it used to be 

205.25 206.10 A: yeah 

212.03 212.92 A: uh-huh 

216.42 218.84 B: i think what they've done is they've just changed 

218.94 221.28 B: polish jokes to blonde jokes 

221.07 222.02 A: mhm 

221.38 223.57 B: it used to be you know 

223.74 224.86 B: (( how do you get )) 

223.80 224.73 A: now 

224.87 228.65 B: a i think they've just changed the verbiage on the jokes 

228.96 230.75 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

230.11 233.55 B: and um i because i'm not really into the 

233.71 237.27 B: um ethnic jokes either i mean [sigh] 

238.45 245.90 A: now as far as those are concerned i i find like all manner of of racist jokes to be humorous 

239.15 239.95 B: i guess 

245.47 246.43 B: mhm 

246.13 258.83 A: but and they make me laugh when i read them and but i hesitate definitely to forward those to anybody because you know you you don't uh some people are offended by those types of things 

248.56 249.65 B: mhm 

257.51 260.37 B: right i guess it's in the context 

260.24 261.34 A: mhm 

260.46 262.17 B: 'cause like um 

262.44 266.38 B: eddie murphy can pull things off that other comedians wouldn't be able to 

266.03 267.18 A: mhm 

266.52 268.93 B: um dave chappelle i don't know 

269.47 278.71 B: if you've seen his show but there's things that i don't even think other black comedians could pull off like he does [noise] um so i guess it's the context 

275.58 276.53 A: yeah 

278.77 280.17 B: but um 

280.78 282.46 B: i don't have any 

283.15 284.19 B: um 

285.98 297.91 B: i guess i when i was younger i'd get on my soapbox more about things and the older i get and i have four kids it doesn't seem to be one of my [laughter] you know issues to argue about so um 

292.51 293.44 A: mhm 

296.08 297.26 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

298.41 299.75 B: (( [cough] i uh )) 

300.10 305.15 B: i don't know i just i know i have a warped sense of humor and a lot of that comes from the medical 

305.45 306.52 B: stuff 

306.58 311.47 A: well um [cough] i guess i got exposed to a lot of 

306.70 307.55 B: (( so )) 

311.62 312.61 A: this 

313.05 322.06 A: what i like to call these this internet humor topics like i mentioned about the babies and the retarded people 

316.66 317.54 B: uh-huh 

321.16 322.42 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

322.54 327.66 A: and you know i just know some people that like know like every single 

327.83 331.78 A: funny or crude saying that's on the internet and where to find it 

331.32 332.25 B: uh-huh 

331.82 335.42 A: and they you know i so i got exposed to some of those things 

335.70 345.12 A: and i was like that's just wrong you don't [laughter] you don't make fun of those kind of things because later on you might have a child that has that problem 

344.58 356.43 B: yeah oh yeah right right i have teenage boys and it's and any time they would say anything about special ed kids at school i would say you know what you may have a child like that some day or you could get in an accident 

352.37 353.21 A: [laughter] 

356.65 362.23 A: [cough] and in fact i guess my er in one of my and i hate to admit this but 

362.66 367.83 A: it's one er an experience i've had over over my lifetime is 

367.87 373.59 A: when i was in high school there was a friend that i had and she was kind of like an acquaintance 

373.80 378.13 A: and her name was rosemary and um she talked kind of slow 

378.02 378.88 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

378.47 382.09 A: and so it made her sound like she was kind of 

382.70 384.09 A: s- slow 

383.89 384.77 B: uh-huh 

384.60 386.68 A: and you know 

386.74 388.22 A: we liked her 

388.98 393.38 A: but when she wasn't around we kind of made fun of how she talked and stuff 

392.79 393.74 B: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

393.47 397.41 A: and come to find out she actually had epilepsy 

397.63 406.23 A: and her speech had been impacted by the fact that she'd had like a lot of seizures and she was on medication for that 

405.88 406.73 B: (( hm )) 

406.71 411.50 A: and so [cough] as it turns out um when i t- 

411.66 414.44 A: was uh turned maybe around eighteen 

414.46 416.72 A: i developed a seizure disorder 

416.38 417.23 B: (( oh )) 

417.91 432.37 A: [laughter] so isn't it ironic [laughter] and see i just i don't know i just that always made that always made me think you don't ever want to sit there and poke fun of things 'cause you just never know when it could happen to you or somebody that 

419.83 421.59 B: right right 

433.33 434.96 A: that you care about 

434.43 436.10 B: right right 

435.09 435.85 A: so 

436.34 437.24 B: well i 

436.56 447.59 A: and i also don't think it's in good taste to um uh and i really dislike this and it cau- and this causes me to form an opinion [noise] about another person as it relates to bad humor 

448.13 454.64 A: is when you uh make fun at an and have a laugh at another person's expense 

454.22 455.23 B: (( uh-huh right )) 

454.65 455.55 A: like 

456.23 458.72 A: for example you're out somewhere 

459.00 465.86 A: and maybe somebody is wearing something that they shouldn't be wearing it doesn't look that good on them where in fact 

466.48 468.94 A: some people would make a joke out of that 

468.25 469.15 B: uh-huh 

469.07 475.88 A: or or somebody's dancing funny and they make a joke out i don't like that if some- i i just like people to be who they want to be 

476.12 481.10 A: and be able to you know be out and not be the uh 

481.57 487.80 A: brunt of other people's humor you know what i'm saying like an overweight person or 

484.11 485.04 B: right 

485.17 486.38 B: right well i'm uh 

487.45 488.45 B: right 

488.25 495.50 A: it it kind of turns me off when i when other people make fun of other people and entertain themselves in that way 

492.67 494.03 B: yeah 

495.30 496.24 B: right 

496.76 497.87 B: yeah 

497.52 498.43 A: so 

498.63 501.76 A: i don't get real uptight about that but it's like come on 

498.65 499.55 B: i know 

501.56 514.69 B: well i was on the brunt i was on the receiving end of that because we have a big big nightclub here and it's primarily early twenties and i'm in my late thirties and me and my friends who are also in their late thirties are out there dancing 

510.19 511.08 A: uh-huh 

514.71 515.72 A: uh-huh

519.96 520.85 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

520.08 533.05 B: and it's like they were making fun of us and we were not dancing disco believe me we don't dance like john travolta and it was like well it just turned me off going to that place but i mean i can being on the receiving end yeah 

530.98 532.45 A: [noise] [noise] so there you go

540.04 549.47 A: well i'm also i'm i'm thirty eight i just turned thirty eight and i don't think twice about going places where the younger crowds go 

549.01 549.89 B: uh-huh 

549.50 553.75 A: but at times you do notice that they look at you like oh what's up with her
