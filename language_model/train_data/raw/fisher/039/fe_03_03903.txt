94.06 95.34 A: right 

94.34 97.89 B: you know that young children can watch that so 

98.03 102.31 B: um you know i think that's very very um inappropriate 

102.21 105.67 A: no i i completely agree with you i-i mean if 

105.75 115.93 A: you know i mean and they and they tell you what what i like what for are you going to watch a program like that i mean hopefully the parents are responsible enough to know what their children are watching 

114.60 115.81 B: mhm 

115.83 120.75 B: you know but so many of them aren't so many of them just let their kids watch 

115.95 117.07 A: you know that they're 

120.64 122.70 A: whatever they want to watch 

120.83 124.17 B: t._v. kind of kind of like a baby sitter 

123.89 124.98 A: right 

124.42 127.85 B: you know and they don't really realise um 

128.06 132.83 B: and you know i'm probably my kids are grown now but i have grandchildren 

132.76 133.69 A: uh-huh 

132.89 136.93 B: and there's several things that i really didn't um 

137.48 142.19 B: you know that that i really didn't give a lot of thought to like um 

142.90 145.21 B: you know some of the more um 

146.15 147.46 B: popular 

147.60 150.36 B: um programs on [mn] 

150.41 152.19 B: even nickelodeon 

152.29 166.68 A: oh yeah no they can be very graphic in what what they consider funny 'cause th- i mean i mean you look at it and you're what are they watching or you know especi- you know even like cartoons when they bring out the guns and shooting and oh and that's just supposed to be funny 

154.08 155.91 B: you know i mean i was 

159.59 160.84 B: mhm 

163.55 164.49 B: oh yeah 

166.30 167.97 B: right right 

167.08 176.38 A: and i don't know maybe maybe i'm like naive a lot of the time because i'm like oh i don't really get that [laughter] unless it's you know pretty blatant to me 

175.78 181.69 B: right right that doesn't that doesn't strike me as funny either like i said i'm kind of the 

176.96 177.90 A: (( you )) 

179.47 181.46 A: no yeah 

182.10 186.65 B: the of the old school and i like the slapstick type 

183.85 184.91 A: uh-huh 

187.32 189.74 B: comedy you know i think ah 

190.37 197.75 B: i think that kind of thing is more more funny than you know than some of the other stuff um 

193.62 194.63 A: uh-huh 

197.76 200.77 A: i enjoy when they make fun of themselves 

200.54 202.09 B: yeah yeah 

201.19 210.34 A: when th- you know they attack themselves and that way in that respect that's not as bad as when they when they attack like say like a whole religion 

203.53 206.84 B: yeah that's not so bad yet that's not so bad 

209.97 211.04 B: right 

210.34 217.69 A: or you know and that that's when it kind of gets uncomfortable because you're like how do they know what type of audience they're speaking to 

213.73 214.98 B: mhm 

217.14 220.89 B: right they're you know i mean maybe 

218.15 219.01 A: or 

221.33 223.57 B: you may disagree but 

223.16 224.03 A: uh-huh 

223.58 228.11 B: for example i i do not see anything funny in the simpsons 

228.64 229.73 A: in the what 

229.32 231.11 B: the simpsons 

230.64 232.03 A: oh okay 

231.79 234.36 B: i don't think they're the least bit funny 

234.11 235.02 A: uh-huh 

234.54 235.58 B: um 

236.44 239.61 B: you know they they um 

239.65 252.78 B: the the boy the boy ah bart is he's disrespectful to his parents you know his parents are portrayed as complete idiots and morons 

242.09 243.83 A: bart uh-huh 

245.75 246.99 A: yeah 

251.08 252.15 A: right 

252.35 253.56 A: yeah 

252.91 258.86 B: and you know i just don't think i don't think that kind of humor is good for children at all 

258.82 266.22 A: well yeah no i don't think it's for kids at all i mean i i do enjoy it i do think it's funny but i don't 

259.07 259.96 B: um 

264.61 268.33 B: well it's a cart- you know it's a cartoon and kids 

268.01 269.87 A: they're attracted to that 

269.00 273.99 B: are attracted to that but i don't think it's the kind of cartoon a kid should be watching 

273.66 280.80 A: no no and my mom my mom's a teacher and it drives her crazy because they come in to school 

280.51 281.42 B: mhm 

280.57 294.72 A: and well if they can do this then i can do this kind of an attitude and my mom's like no you know so my m- it drives my mother crazy but i'm like ha ha ha this is so funny but here i am twenty seven years old thinking it's funny at an adult level 

283.19 284.08 B: right 

291.27 292.62 B: right 

295.14 305.53 A: and you know and she's like wel- and like you said as a baby sitter when parents aren't watching what their kids are watching you know i don't think elementary school kids should be watching that 

304.65 307.94 B: no i i don't either i don't either i uh 

308.33 312.17 B: i just don't think it's it's appropriate at all 

311.98 313.22 A: no 

312.64 318.56 B: and the thing the thing is it that amazes me i guess is um 

318.66 325.31 B: the fact that they now have cartoons that are geared toward adults 

325.07 327.89 A: yeah and they're rated 

325.83 330.61 B: you know i mean that's kind of kind of weird to me i mean 

330.71 340.20 B: cartoons to me cartoons were bugs bunny and daffy duck and you know and yuck yuck and and little kids and that kind of thing and then 

335.15 336.11 A: uh-huh 

340.44 344.79 B: now all of a sudden you have these cartoons that are geared toward adults 

344.64 346.53 A: yeah 

345.01 347.53 B: like some of the ones on m._t._v. 

347.52 353.15 A: oh yeah and see and now look at it and that's and that's all supposed to be funny 

347.87 351.90 B: um you know those are totally geared towards adults 

352.89 353.95 B: right 

353.60 357.88 A: you know with the like i said with like the blowing up or like they're cussing 

357.80 359.01 B: mhm 

358.45 366.30 A: you know and i like the i don't know whether you remember the beavis and butthead i just oh they drove me nuts 

359.32 360.25 B: mhm 

362.62 364.21 B: mhm 

365.68 367.43 B: oh yeah me too 

366.45 368.42 A: that was just 

367.55 375.15 B: that was that was even that was even [laughter] even for adults that was bad [laughter] 

368.85 370.79 A: way uncalled for 

371.02 372.54 A: [laughter] 

374.31 377.55 A: yeah i was just like i don't see 

376.39 379.96 B: that was an insult to anybody's intelligence i think 

379.31 380.79 A: yeah 

380.35 384.37 B: oh [mn] but but you know i probably 

385.24 392.54 B: if i ha- didn't keep up with things as well as i do and my grandchildren were over 

392.99 398.91 B: and i walked through the room and they were watching a cartoon i it probably wouldn't even dawn on me 

393.29 394.04 A: uh-huh 

398.79 399.97 A: right 

399.30 403.76 B: that they were watching something that was not appropriate for 

404.02 406.33 B: young children to be watching 

406.14 407.22 A: right 

406.53 409.24 B: because like i said when i 

409.34 417.38 B: my age group when we grew up there was no such thing as an adult cartoon cartoons were geared toward kids 

414.68 415.75 A: right 

416.92 418.15 A: yeah 

417.90 419.07 B: so 

419.37 424.16 B: i'm good you know i try to keep up with that kind of thing because i don't want them over here 

424.37 427.75 B: you know they they they know their boundaries at home 

427.79 429.84 B: but you know how kids are 

427.99 429.35 A: yeah 

429.56 434.04 A: oh they're going to push 'em everywhere they can uh-huh [laughter] [sigh] 

430.02 439.01 B: they could push the envelope when they're over here and see what they can get away with you know oh yeah grandma's not you know she's not 

438.96 447.59 B: up on all this stuff we can get no sorry [laughter] i hate to tell 'em but i try to keep up with it and 

440.47 444.69 A: yeah [laughter] yeah 

447.63 449.51 B: you know and keep it uh 

450.12 452.94 B: away from them if i possibly can 

452.73 454.40 A: (( yeah oh good )) 

453.57 462.35 B: so but my my daughter is pretty good about monitoring what they they're allowed to do and what they're allowed to watch and you know 

461.03 466.25 A: do you ever go do you ever see live comedy have you ever gone to see live comedy have you ever gone to see a comedy show 

465.68 469.44 B: it's been oh gosh years and years ago 

469.31 470.58 A: yeah 

469.96 474.34 B: and uh and it was in an adult comedy club 

473.71 475.15 A: not uh-huh 

474.90 477.79 B: and so you know that was uh 

479.20 484.41 B: [sigh] i i i just i don't know i just didn't care for it that much 

483.28 484.90 A: no uh-huh 

484.56 485.52 B: um 

487.04 497.90 B: there was a lot of poking fun at people and you know and finger pointing at pe- different people in the audience and i just didn't like that i just didn't think that was very 

489.67 491.19 A: there wa- yeah 

493.20 494.53 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

498.22 501.51 B: very funny it didn't do it for me 

499.34 500.55 A: yeah 

501.17 502.31 A: right 

502.43 506.41 A: no 'cause i had used to work at a place and it would seems like 

502.43 503.31 B: (( mhm )) 

506.21 519.89 A: who was ever on stage they would try and gear it and as soon as they started getting a couple of laughs making fun of something then they would just continually they would just roll with that and continue to go over and over you know and 

511.98 513.02 B: (( mhm )) 

514.78 516.49 B: mhm 

520.03 527.96 A: and one of the times what really offended me was the guy said don't forget to tip your waitresses they'll need it for their abortions 

527.92 530.24 B: oh that was not even funny 

529.16 540.08 A: and i you know because they always you know try and give a plug oh you know give don't forget to tip for this and that which i liked but for him to go over and [mn] pay for abor- i'm like wh- what 

534.18 535.76 B: mhm 

539.76 545.00 B: that that oh yeah that that was definitely uh out of bounds 

540.23 542.42 A: (( is that yeah it )) 

542.96 557.81 A: was so uncalled for yeah i mean he could have said something else like they need to pay for their clothes so they look cute for you or something like that [mn] but to go and a- and attack every single one of us an- and i was oh i was so heated up by 

545.13 547.40 B: (( that was definitely out of bounds )) 

549.80 553.39 B: right oh yeah yeah 

557.57 559.70 A: his comment i was just like 

559.76 563.61 B: oh i can understand that that was uh 

559.77 560.65 A: you know 

563.55 577.32 A: you know because then the people think that he's affiliated there at the place with us and you know and and especially with an abortion i mean people don't take those lightly it's 

564.12 566.13 B: very distasteful 

568.30 569.46 B: mhm 

570.27 571.69 B: right 

576.45 579.22 B: no that's not that's not something 

577.47 579.45 A: so controversial 

580.13 581.60 B: people um 

581.61 586.14 B: like you said they don't take that kind of thing lightly that's a serious issue 

586.10 587.94 A: (( right [mn] )) 

586.56 590.76 B: and not something that should be joked about in any 

591.13 592.57 A: yeah 

591.15 594.02 B: any way shape or form whether you're 

594.49 596.24 B: whether you're pro or
