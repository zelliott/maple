504.14 513.94 A: yeah and i don't like i know there was a movie about called shallow hal i think that's what it was called that i had no desire to see 

513.67 514.70 B: oh 

514.35 522.04 A: because it was basically i thought making fun of people who are overweight i i don't find that funny [mn] 

519.12 520.27 B: yeah 

521.45 526.84 B: no 'cause that's basically discriminating against them just 'cause they're heavy and hey that could be a great person

533.48 546.36 A: yeah it's tasteless now if you know i- i'm i'm a minority i'm a member of a minority group and we'll poke fun at ourselves but if someone's doing it like if there was that mean edge i find that very offensive 

546.03 555.60 B: yeah so do i like i'm i happen to be a blonde and i'll say things like ooh i- i'm blonde what do you want from me but but i'm just making fun of myself i'm not saying you know

564.47 566.64 B: it myself to joke sometimes 

566.12 567.62 A: mhm

570.11 571.51 A: [laughter] 

572.65 583.22 A: [laughter] yeah i think we're right on we're exactly on the same page ah with dealing with middle schoolers sometimes it's hard to get that across to them 

583.28 591.48 A: i i always tell them 'cause they want to tell me jokes and my only rule with middle schoolers is if it's a joke [mn] that you wouldn't tell your grandmother don't tell me 

591.49 598.67 A: now of course i tell those kind of jokes to my friends but i always tell my middle schoolers you don't tell that to me [laughter]
