218.39 232.33 A: you know some if you were really you know like let's say you were a gay person or something you might take offence to maybe some of the things they say but [mn] you know they're just making fun of themselves in a way you know what i mean it's like yeah exactly 

222.73 223.65 B: (( ahah )) 

228.69 231.70 B: right for the most part 

232.17 236.08 A: and i think that's what comedy does so it's really difficult to 

236.23 238.66 A: to say when it's 

237.52 246.09 B: [mn] yeah except for when the only thing i i disagree with is when the comedians bring different religions and stuff into their act 

245.91 252.67 B: you know because there's there's ways of being funny without ah being offensive you know or 

251.63 254.09 A: yeah that's really offensive 

252.89 259.40 B: taking it right or taking it you know just to unnecessary places [mn] 'cause 

258.48 259.91 A: (( [mn] exactly )) 

259.95 265.47 B: there's enough humor in the world you know you can find enough stuff to laugh about 

264.71 266.04 A: [mn] that's true 

266.07 280.17 A: that's true [mn] when i was a kid we used to always watch bill cosby and he would always talk about the other comedians and how they [mn] they use too many too much foul language and stuff like that and that one time that eddie murphy got up on stage and was talking about 

275.11 277.61 B: right right 

280.43 284.10 A: bill cosby [laughter] and um 

282.06 282.97 B: (( ahah )) 

284.13 295.06 A: you know just saying you gotta stop with the filth and the foul and [mn] i don't know if you ever watched that [laughter] but bill cosby had talked to eddie murphy and told him that he needed to stop with all the bad language 

289.58 290.92 B: (( no )) 

294.33 296.18 B: (( really now see )) 

294.90 299.18 A: he was like i'm a millionaire from that [laughter] 

297.44 302.99 B: right but that's more how martin lawrence is too he had in his act one day 

302.83 314.52 B: that his mom was telling him to quit using that language and then he showed her a copy of one of the cheques that they gave him it right you know and then it was like okay 

309.98 313.24 A: yeah exactly [laughter] [laughter] he's just 

313.94 318.35 A: he's just giving the people what they want [laughter] and then 

316.09 319.43 B: right right [noise] 

318.84 322.66 A: h- hello [mn] and if you have kids you just um 

322.69 323.57 A: (( you know )) 

322.78 326.89 B: right some of those things are just not meant for kids to hear right 

323.73 325.72 A: don't don't let 'em watch it 

326.45 329.32 A: yeah just don't let 'em watch it [mn] 

327.00 328.25 B: you know it's not 

329.06 334.69 B: there's no rule to say as kids have to be in the room with the parents all the time and see everything together 

332.48 333.62 A: mhm 

334.42 335.25 A: yeah 

335.06 340.34 B: that's why they have you know cartoon network and kids' channels and all that good stuff 

338.90 339.84 A: mhm 

340.89 342.75 A: mhm that's true 

343.51 345.19 A: [mn] there's ah you know 

344.58 345.29 B: [noise] 

345.29 353.74 A: there's of course always you know the people who don't know when to tell jokes and and who to tell 'em to and stuff like that so they might 

353.93 355.69 B: mhm 

355.01 356.23 A: (( [mn] [cough] [mn] )) 

356.57 361.16 A: say something that might offend somebody you know that that could always happen 

359.02 360.44 B: right 

360.98 362.13 B: right 

363.02 372.34 A: you know like you know you could tell a blonde joke you could tell a fat joke you could tell an- a kinda racial joke and [mn] people are gonna totally take offence to it 

372.06 373.06 B: right 

372.45 379.98 A: you know what i mean and then other people might not but [mn] some things should just be left unsaid whether you think it's funny or not 

379.83 386.34 B: right well i just you know if if it were done or said to you how would you feel you know and then just go from there 

386.38 390.09 B: if you know the golden rule do unto others 

386.39 387.37 A: mhm 

390.02 391.29 A: exactly 

391.83 395.11 B: and people just forget about that sometimes 

392.12 393.31 A: (( exactly )) 

396.50 400.54 A: yeah like if you tell a joke you know would you find it funny if it were if it were 

400.37 401.73 B: right 

400.68 402.73 A: something you know one of 

401.85 403.68 B: geared towards you 

403.36 405.13 A: yeah exactly 

403.79 405.27 B: (( [noise] i )) 

407.18 408.22 B: (( don't know )) 

408.29 410.77 B: (( it gets rough sometimes )) 

410.06 411.08 A: mhm 

411.26 419.42 B: [mn] but then i guess it's really gotta be hard standing up in front of an audience sometimes especially when the audience gets to heckling you you know the comedian 

419.31 420.90 A: yeah that's true 

420.93 424.60 A: [mn] usually the people who heckle are the people who've had too much to drink 

424.18 425.45 B: right 

424.72 428.99 A: [laughter] and they think they're funnier than than the comedian 

425.64 427.05 B: (( right than )) 

427.62 430.41 B: the comedian right 

429.24 443.76 A: and it never ends up that way and sometimes when you i've watched shows where they've had hecklers and they just make it more funny you know because then the comedian goes back at them and so then it ends up being more funny because you know the comedian's definitely 

443.75 444.42 A: (( go- )) 

444.52 450.53 A: got more experience with it and they know what they're saying and what they're doing and [mn] yeah 

446.93 448.42 B: mhm 

450.14 452.09 B: yeah it's it's funny 

452.04 453.18 A: mhm 

453.39 454.21 B: (( [mn] )) 

453.70 461.41 A: i love the comedians who get up on stage and they just um it's all impromptu like they just pick somebody out of the audience and say oh what do you do for a living 

461.10 462.17 B: right 

461.86 464.16 A: and [mn] they just 

462.95 465.00 B: (( that's like d. o. [lipsmack] )) 

464.78 465.91 A: mhm 

465.68 467.75 B: i think he does that a lot 

467.34 468.39 A: mhm 

468.07 476.37 B: [mn] what's you know like oh i like seinfeld's humor his humor is good he's funny but he's not really talking about anything to be funny 

476.03 477.11 A: i know 

477.51 482.86 A: [mn] some of it's funny sometimes i think some of it's boring but some of it's funny his show is hysterical 

483.02 485.30 A: i loved his show when it was on 

485.45 488.53 A: i absolutely loved it i love to watch the reruns but 

487.97 490.01 B: right 

488.64 492.50 A: and he doesn't really offend anybody he doesn't you know 

490.92 497.01 B: no he he that's what i say he's just a you know a basic old just kind of funny you know 

496.38 501.86 A: mhm and he doesn't really talk too bad about anybody in particular you know what i mean 

503.70 507.41 B: (( [laughter] yes )) 

506.13 512.69 A: yeah it's nice to watch comedians that kinda hit home too you know that like you can relate to and 

509.58 511.39 B: (( [mn] right )) 

511.93 515.46 B: the reality kinda shows and things like that

516.84 517.67 A: yeah 

518.76 519.48 B: (( okay )) 

519.48 521.78 A: but there's really no you know 

522.45 528.25 A: i don't think there's any shows on right now as far as comedy shows that really draw the line i know 

528.84 530.29 A: that like um 

529.98 530.65 B: (( mhm )) 

531.22 545.32 A: like when the ellen degeneres show was on a long time ago that was the last time i saw any real um things that people kind of took offence to when she came out of the closet some people were like oh i'm not watching this show any more i'm not going to let my kids watch the show and stuff like that 

546.08 548.54 A: but um i don't think there's 

546.22 549.79 B: yeah ellen was good 

548.91 550.15 A: yeah

566.30 567.43 A: that's okay 

567.57 576.10 A: way back when when you had like controversial shows like archie bunker and then when the jeffersons spun off of that and stuff like that those were like controversial shows 

572.04 573.61 B: [noise] mhm 

576.07 577.92 B: but they were funny 

576.42 577.11 A: they 

577.31 582.71 A: they were funny but they dealt with racial issues especially at a time when they were like 

578.65 580.04 B: yeah
