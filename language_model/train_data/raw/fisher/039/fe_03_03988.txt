14.52 15.23 A: (( ooh )) 

15.01 18.54 B: okay it's on comedy right 

18.12 19.22 A: right 

18.84 20.43 B: (( and what kind you )) 

20.87 24.62 B: draw the line of what you lo- you know what goes too far 

24.37 25.56 A: right 

24.92 27.44 B: let's see i like comedy 

27.83 28.93 B: um 

30.49 36.08 B: some i don't like houston parrs [laughter] 

33.66 36.05 A: [laughter] 

37.62 44.33 A: well i'm originally from chicago so i like both [laughter] i like the humor in both cities um 

38.06 38.92 B: (( [cough] )) 

45.22 50.17 A: this is where to draw the line um i think most comedy is funny 

47.00 47.83 B: (( yes )) 

49.87 51.21 B: yeah 

50.42 51.57 A: um 

51.61 54.96 A: i think it ca- gets touchy when it gets on the basis of 

55.09 58.64 A: more race than anything else a lot of um 

58.85 69.18 A: jokes that are geared toward the sexes like m- um jokes about stereotypes of males or stereotypes of females are pretty acceptable but i think um 

65.32 66.19 B: uh-huh 

69.36 72.04 A: sometimes when it gets to race it gets touchy 

72.04 73.08 B: yeah 

72.39 77.02 A: and it depends on the person whom the joke is being told to 

78.41 86.73 B: yeah or if you know it's comedy and they use a lot of bad language like richard pryor or something [laughter] 

86.88 91.28 A: but he was funny [laughter] he was funny [laughter] 

87.72 90.52 B: he was funny but 

90.79 92.26 B: (( yeah he was )) 

93.86 99.85 B: so i don't know i don't guess i really draw the line [laughter] i just either watch it or i don't 

99.89 101.01 A: (( [laughter] true )) 

101.17 103.70 A: i think that's true um 

103.67 107.08 B: but then i don't watch with kids or nothing [noise] 

106.44 109.74 A: oh absolutely definitely not yeah 

107.19 108.45 B: so 

108.72 111.71 B: either we watch it or we don't 

110.70 113.46 A: like if you're watching a chris rock um 

113.71 117.45 A: on h._b._o. or something you know that the kid needs to be in the bed 

117.10 118.47 B: yeah well 

117.53 119.40 A: definitely [laughter] 

118.73 125.29 B: we don't have any ki- i mean we have grown kids that have moved away so we're just usually mostly here by ourselves 

122.31 124.02 A: oh okay 

125.26 127.51 A: four year old [laughter] 

128.52 129.65 A: um 

130.74 131.58 A: (( mm )) 

131.86 134.21 A: comedy where do you draw the line 

134.60 136.02 A: i i think 

136.55 142.23 A: for me it probably would apply more on a personal level about where you draw the line like you said basically 

142.20 153.29 A: if it's something that's televised or uh that you're hearing of a recording or something like you said if you don't want to hear it then you just don't listen to it and if you do then you do 

144.56 145.47 B: yeah 

150.52 152.63 B: yeah or i might 

153.09 154.78 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

153.66 159.71 A: but it's it's i think it's maybe a different situation if you're face to face like if you're in a 

158.27 158.85 B: [noise] 

159.73 164.30 A: a work environment of course where it's inappropriate um 

164.35 167.65 A: for some type of jokes and some people i don't think 

167.85 174.20 A: i think they know better but maybe they think that people will accept some of the type of jokes that they tell 

172.20 172.93 B: (( [noise] mm )) 

173.56 175.08 B: [noise] [noise] yeah 

174.46 175.66 A: um 

176.62 179.06 B: or men telling dirty jokes to women 

177.89 189.62 A: [noise] e- e- exactly right yeah there's it's definitely a man thing because if it's a group of them you know they'll laugh and they won't tell on each other but if a woman gets offended then 

179.13 180.82 B: yeah 

189.67 190.85 A: um 

191.09 198.52 A: it becomes the women's being sexist which really isn't true there's a uh time and place for 

191.24 191.83 B: (( [noise] )) 

192.94 195.35 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

196.74 197.45 B: (( [noise] )) 

198.70 211.39 A: for all types of jokes and you know at the workplace it's just majority of jokes that you would hear like un like in the venue we were talking about on t._v. stand up or something really shouldn't be told at work 

211.31 212.07 B: mhm 

211.74 213.96 A: you know between friends 

213.97 219.61 A: again if you know your friend and it's one on one you know what's acceptable and what isn't 

218.22 220.08 B: yeah 

220.34 221.41 A: (( so )) 

222.84 223.80 A: hm 

224.85 226.89 A: and where do you draw the line 

227.80 236.62 B: well it could be like you said you have a four year old i mean you might watch something when he's not there but then when he's there you wouldn't watch it 

235.51 237.39 A: right definitely 

237.32 240.25 B: like south park do [laughter] you like south park 

239.02 243.77 A: [laughter] that's hard too south park's funny [laughter] 

242.65 245.89 B: [laughter] 

245.58 247.32 A: oh and they 

246.21 250.89 B: because we watch south park but well you can't watch it when they're the kids around 

250.06 251.14 A: right 

251.20 257.22 A: and you know they may sound a little tougher those south parks when they about a couple of years ago they had a video game out 

256.83 257.92 B: yeah 

257.31 262.42 A: and it was geared toward children but children can't watch the show 

259.21 260.41 B: (( oh really [laughter] yeah )) 

263.20 275.43 A: so that was kinda touchy and the game was pretty clean 'cause um we played it but still it was confusing because you know a kid would want to know well why can't why can i play the game but i cannot watch the show 

275.05 276.02 B: (( yeah oh no )) 

275.57 278.94 A: and then you have to explain to the you know explain to him well 

279.10 285.50 A: this the video game and the show are different and then you get into explaining why and what he can't watch and 

282.90 284.28 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

285.51 290.04 A: then so sometimes they make it tougher for you to draw the line too 

289.71 290.51 B: (( yeah uh-uh )) 

290.19 291.80 A: because the game 

292.07 296.28 A: shouldn't have been geared toward children since they can't watch the show so 

296.44 298.24 A: [laughter] 

296.57 303.95 B: no [laughter] and then i think besides them there there there's another one that's came out with like muppets and that's 

304.38 305.37 A: muppets 

305.21 315.32 B: yeah what's the name of that [noise] it's uh on one of those cable shows uh it's like south park but it's muppets and they talk like 

313.16 314.41 A: oh 

314.54 317.23 A: yes on the comedy central channel 

316.18 320.13 B: yeah they make phone calls to [laughter] people and stuff 

318.36 321.32 A: oh yeah crank that's it 

320.60 329.32 B: yeah yeah so that sort of thing i think online if you're there alone or if there's kids or that because you can just watch it or you can't [laughter] 

326.11 327.57 A: [laughter] 

328.66 330.41 A: right [laughter] 

329.65 330.69 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

331.85 345.59 A: and and it and um like you said that that's a good example too because they've got puppets kids see puppets if you have to be turning by let's day during the day and there's a commercial and the kids see puppets and they think hey i can watch this 

341.78 342.77 B: yeah 

345.22 359.71 B: [laughter] [laughter] even though they're calling somebody and talking dirty to 'em [laughter] you know it would be bad though 'cause they're uh prank people on there [laughter] kids would start calling and pranking people 

345.96 347.45 A: [laughter] 

348.90 350.13 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

355.16 356.40 A: [laughter] 

356.88 358.62 A: i've not heard some of those 

359.50 363.17 A: i've heard some of those pranks though i wouldn't want my kid doing those 

362.91 365.19 B: no i know 

363.31 363.96 A: (( [laughter] )) 

366.12 370.63 B: [noise] but that's the only thing i could think of have you did very many of these surveys 

368.37 369.35 A: (( so )) 

370.83 372.63 A: oh this is my first one 

372.11 377.80 B: oh is it it's my second one i mean they called me every night till one o'clock in the morning 

372.71 373.64 A: um 

377.87 388.84 B: and i've had had forgotten my number 'cause they gave it to me months before [laughter] and then finally i called them and got it and i didn't hear from them for a month [laughter] 

380.50 381.19 A: oh 

382.38 384.60 A: that's what happened to me [laughter] 

388.90 392.54 A: well i think it's good you don't need it now 'cause um 

392.78 400.91 A: as you said i had lost mine and i got an email one day and i was like oh and i wrote it down and this time when i answered i didn't need it so [laughter] 

397.23 398.14 B: yeah 

399.50 405.59 B: yeah that's what well me too i thought oh where did i write that at this time [laughter] 

402.09 403.11 A: right 

407.09 408.19 A: (( so )) 

409.62 415.14 A: in conclusion i would say it all depends on the individual and again whom 

413.58 414.14 B: (( [noise] )) 

415.27 421.72 A: the joke might be directed at or in what what venue the joke is in and that would determine where 

417.50 418.57 B: yeah 

421.86 423.47 A: you draw the line 

423.52 424.42 B: (( yeah )) 

423.98 428.41 A: personally that's what i you know that's kinda what i feel right 

425.93 428.45 B: sounds good to me yeah 

429.34 430.28 A: (( 'cause a )) 

430.33 431.05 B: [noise] 

430.65 438.22 A: joke that your mom might tell you could be [laughter] any type of joke and you may laugh and never be offended at it in any any way shape or form 

438.00 439.07 B: yeah 

438.44 441.84 A: but then someone else can tell it to you and it's offensive 

442.21 443.20 A: (( so )) 

442.42 445.61 B: depending on yeah who the person is [noise] 

444.13 445.35 A: right 

447.01 448.06 A: (( so )) 

448.62 449.85 A: and some 

448.75 449.78 B: okay 

450.05 450.88 B: huh 

450.11 457.15 A: and it i'm sorry [laughter] go ahead and another thing is comedy too says where do you draw the line some times comedy 

451.69 453.14 B: go ahe- you go ahead 

457.25 459.41 A: helps eases tensions too 

459.13 460.58 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

459.46 464.92 A: you know like when they were making jokes during um at the beginning of uh the war 

465.08 470.88 A: and uh well before it started they were making jokes about the president and at that time 

468.69 469.65 B: yeah 

470.94 478.64 A: everyone you know thought it was in in uh good humor but once the war started then no one wanted to make jokes about the president 

476.52 477.32 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

478.70 481.29 A: because they didn't think it was in good taste 

481.76 482.91 A: (( so )) 

484.59 498.98 A: i don't know i think it still it could of it could have helped ease tension because they were still making jokes about middle you know like um was it uh what's his name bin laden and hussein and they had these cards i saw on the internet were just 

498.87 505.15 A: now and i thought that was pretty tasteless but i'm sure [laughter] some people didn't where you you buy cards of uh 

505.27 509.78 A: uh what was it called you're iraqi some type of card 

509.13 517.01 B: yeah but see the army and the government really gave those out to the soldiers so they would know what all these people look like 

517.45 525.17 B: over there everybody had a deck of cards with these pictures on it so they knew who all these people you know the leaders and stuff they were looking for 

524.74 525.70 A: yes 

525.68 530.40 B: so but now they're selling 'em on ebay and everywheres else [laughter] yeah [noise] 

528.26 533.37 A: [laughter] so yeah that i think that's bad taste 

532.95 534.10 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

533.42 547.41 A: that's bad taste and now that's a place i think you should draw the line as you said that wasn't what they were meant for and now everybody's got 'em and buying them and people are making money off a something that was meant for a different purpose so 

543.11 544.32 B: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

546.30 547.26 B: yeah 

549.12 550.07 A: (( but )) 

550.71 553.56 A: just all depends on the individual [laughter] 

553.31 554.31 B: (( it does )) 

554.83 559.06 B: everybody will draw the lines somewheres different i guess 

557.66 558.75 A: right 

560.89 561.46 B: (( [noise] )) 

561.40 568.27 A: they said they'd tell us when it's ten minutes [laughter] i said it's they were going to like uh tell us when it's ten minutes [laughter] 

563.53 564.48 B: (( huh )) 

567.50 571.34 B: it's getting close i just looked we've been on here nine something 

570.76 572.28 A: oh okay 

572.03 575.89 B: it seemed like a long ten minutes though doesn't it 

574.11 576.02 A: yes [laughter] 

575.96 578.81 B: that wasn't a very good subject to talk on 

579.31 581.40 A: no but 

581.43 583.11 A: uh maybe the next one will be 

583.89 586.65 A: better different how should i say it [laughter] 

584.06 586.33 B: something yeah 

587.64 589.62 A: but um
