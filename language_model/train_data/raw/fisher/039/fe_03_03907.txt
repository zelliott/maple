115.06 117.70 A: [laughter] 

115.82 126.08 B: [laughter] and just kinda you know let it go that way it depends on what it is i mean if it if it's just um usually if it's something that's just really nasty 

126.30 127.63 B: i just kinda like 

127.74 142.73 B: shake my head and walk away like i don't wanna even be dealing with that you know i'm not gonna change their attitude about how they're gonna be talking they just maybe need to not be saying that near me if my kids are around [mn] then i'll say something [mn] 

131.15 133.25 A: yeah 

140.11 141.49 A: yeah 

142.76 153.39 A: yeah [mn] oh that's it that's good i'm glad to hear that because um [mn] i don't i'm not sure where you live but i live in washington state 

153.05 153.98 B: mhm 

153.66 156.73 A: and i've noticed that a lot of um 

157.13 164.99 A: adult humor or it seems like there's just like the adults i've seen a lot of you know 

165.73 167.42 A: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

167.61 177.51 A: kind of crassness and i don't know just [mn] them being crass in front of their kids and i was just shocked when i saw that 

175.16 178.79 B: well i mean but you see that now on television 

178.80 184.16 B: where things that to me i think are completely inappropriate um 

182.66 183.53 A: (( ahah )) 

184.20 193.11 B: are prime time television you know i mean eight o'clock television where young kids can see that and that i do find offensive we watch a whole lot of nick 

187.21 189.05 A: yeah exactly 

193.55 198.80 B: [mn] because that's the older shows where they did have some standards 

193.73 194.52 A: (( ahah )) 

198.59 199.81 A: (( ahah [mn] )) 

199.13 201.92 B: where everything wasn't involved with 

202.00 203.50 B: with um 

204.22 214.21 B: either body functions which kids seem to find very funny but i mean but nasty body functions you know where they just have to be very explicit about everything 

208.05 209.25 A: [laughter] 

213.93 215.09 A: yeah 

214.25 217.10 B: and um or a lot of foul language 

217.17 218.10 A: (( ahah )) 

217.71 226.44 B: you know i don't i i think well i don't know that i even think there's a time and a place for that but i think that the time and the place definitely is not when my kids are listening 

226.10 228.13 A: yes exactly 

227.79 230.06 B: you know they have to hear enough stuff 

228.40 229.56 A: i agree 

230.12 231.22 A: i'm sorry 

230.67 234.93 B: [mn] they have to hear enough stuff without having to deal with that when they're little 

232.65 237.73 A: yeah yeah if i may ask what what state are you living in 

236.79 238.47 B: i'm in california 

238.20 251.06 A: oh right [mn] yeah mm that's interesting i just i'm i'm actually from texas and [mn] i was just shocked when i saw like some of the attitudes of some of the people i 

251.01 263.35 A: right now i live in seattle and i just think it's just amazing i don't understand you know how you know crass humor can be so prevalent in you know in this society 

263.71 277.04 A: [mn] just you know i spent like quite some time just never watching t._v. ever [mn] and i don't know i guess i it was just a big wake up call and you know i started ah 

277.24 278.40 A: i was i 

278.29 286.04 A: was i'm now in a situation where there is a t._v. in the house and i do watch it quite a bit [mn] um 

285.84 296.57 A: and then to like have to see it on t._v. as well as experience it in society it's just [mn] you know a very big shock to me [laughter] to my system 

295.18 296.23 B: well i think 

296.24 299.48 B: yeah but i think that's a that part of it is that 

299.59 305.81 B: since people see it every day on television they for some reason think that that makes it acceptable 

302.59 303.55 A: (( ahah )) 

306.20 307.24 A: oh 

306.79 313.80 B: and i don't know that that necessarily does although i certainly don't think that a lot of the things that are on t._v. 

314.05 315.15 B: um 

315.45 321.01 B: that are supposed to be funny are any funnier because they're foul 

321.12 325.76 B: you know i think some of the the more innocent shows from way back when [mn] 

321.97 322.86 A: (( ahah )) 

326.03 335.38 B: are probably more funny than some of the stuff that's on now i mean some of the some of the some of the shows i think are very funny but some things like that anna nicole thing 

329.61 331.03 A: [mn] yeah 

335.76 343.64 B: um or of course that's not for kids but i mean or um [lipsmack] gosh i'm just trying to think of 

336.32 338.02 A: ah i don't think 

339.63 340.60 A: (( oh )) 

343.88 355.60 B: i don't watch a whole lot of sitcom stuff but most of the things i don't know i mean with my kids we watch like seventh heaven and [mn] you know that kind of stuff you know we don't watch a whole lot of the sitcoms 'cause th- they're just nasty 

345.60 346.41 A: (( ahah )) 

349.93 350.79 A: (( ahah )) 

351.92 352.88 A: (( ahah )) 

355.26 357.29 A: yeah i agree 

357.53 367.79 A: i agree [mn] i was actually i was watching i- i'm not i don't i don't mean watching i meant i was reading today [mn] um this article [lipsmack] 

368.25 371.52 A: on a carl young ah website 

371.96 374.51 A: i'm not sure if you're familiar with carl young 

374.07 375.16 B: mhm 

375.20 376.80 A: and um 

377.83 379.40 A: [lipsmack] they were 

379.58 381.23 A: there were um 

381.30 385.50 A: oh this this writer was talking about um 

385.62 391.26 A: [mn] actually about ah violence in school situations 

390.81 391.92 B: mhm 

391.53 393.56 A: and how um 

394.21 398.68 A: [mn] th- there this was some like 

399.02 400.09 A: (( some )) 

400.44 405.36 A: kind of intervention group in zurich [mn] and um 

405.71 409.46 A: [mn] they were talking about how they have to like 

409.52 416.71 A: children in schools need to have a sort of outlet to express their aggressive behaviour without 

416.80 417.95 A: um 

419.07 427.26 A: without repressing it and and to be able to kind of channel that that kind of ah 

428.50 438.34 A: [mn] energy into a pr- you know productive or at least not actually acting out the violence and somehow i i think maybe that 

438.79 440.46 A: (( [mn] you know the )) 

440.78 442.44 A: (( i don't know somehow )) 

442.67 450.36 A: all of this foul comedy it just makes me think of you know rebelling or or 

451.04 452.25 A: um 

453.01 460.78 A: i don't know just trying to have shock value or trying to have [mn] i don't i don't you know it's like 

459.86 467.36 B: well no i th- i think a lot of that's true when you're talking about teenagers and things like that but then when you're talking about 

464.41 465.85 A: mhm 

467.66 476.31 B: i'm trying to think of a show that has it and i just don't even watch that much of it but some show that that is just using [mn] 

479.54 493.30 B: s- um something nasty just to get a laugh that just perpetuates it to everybody else to where it just comes down to like almost the lowest common denominator where everybody thinks well then that must be funny it's on television [mn] 

483.10 484.54 A: mhm 

489.03 490.36 A: yeah 

492.59 493.95 A: yeah 

494.90 506.12 B: 'cause i know like in in the schools here we have signs up in the classroom and it it offends me to end but there are signs up in the classroom that say no pr- you know profanity with a line through it 

495.21 495.99 A: (( yes )) 

501.16 501.98 A: (( ahah )) 

506.15 507.03 A: (( ahah )) 

506.46 516.65 B: it's like i mean that shouldn't even be an option kids swearing in classroom that's disrespectful to the teacher they go up to the principal but that's not even allowed any more you can't tell a kid they can't swear 

512.87 513.80 A: (( ahah )) 

516.61 517.71 A: right 

517.12 518.69 B: because you'll get sued 

518.81 520.14 A: oh no way 

519.30 523.65 B: well i mean i won't get sued but the teacher would get sued oh sure you can't you 

521.73 524.52 A: shoot oh that's terrible 

523.79 538.74 B: yeah you see y- you you know it just i mean it's kind of like starts in the school where you can't [mn] you can't teach any values y- you know not that i think that the kids should be taught teachers' values but they need to know respect 

532.24 533.14 A: (( ahah )) 

534.07 535.69 A: [mn] oh 

536.57 537.38 A: (( ahah )) 

539.30 543.20 B: you know we we never back talked to teachers when we were in school 

539.33 540.15 A: (( ahah )) 

542.77 545.05 A: yeah that's terrible 

543.29 548.65 B: and then you see it but that's what gets the laughs on television these little smart alecky kids 

548.34 549.28 A: (( ahah )) 

549.87 551.67 B: talking back to parents 

552.10 554.14 A: [mn] hm that is 

552.98 557.03 B: i somehow fail to see the humour in that too i'm not a big 

555.29 557.41 A: yeah i i agree 

557.09 559.97 B: (( [mn] big fan of smart alec children [mn] )) 

559.61 566.59 A: yes [laughter] i i agree with that you know and then you mention like the um 

568.01 580.23 A: [lipsmack] you know the people suing for this you know there's at the drop of a hat that's the you know i i just don't agree with that that's just like not taking personal responsibility 

579.55 591.99 B: well no one wants to any more i mean we had a kid at school who stole something off um a lunch cart and she was caught and she was taken up to the principal's office the mother was called in 

580.31 581.49 A: for 

581.80 582.99 A: yeah 

592.17 596.83 B: about this and the mom said she wasn't stealing she just took it
