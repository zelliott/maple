55.94 57.04 B: um 

57.99 60.05 B: i don't like offensive of language 

60.57 61.18 A: okay 

60.87 61.48 B: um 

61.91 62.55 A: you mean like 

62.07 63.33 B: you know

63.46 66.61 B: yeah well you know 

67.55 70.85 B: a little bit of a couple of words are okay but you know 

71.07 73.01 B: not when they start getting into the f. -s and the 

73.34 73.83 B: you know 

73.39 73.83 A: yeah 

74.10 74.54 A: yeah 

74.73 76.45 A: okay i agree with that 

76.57 77.92 A: and i and i guess 

77.54 79.25 B: and none of them are like 

79.67 81.57 B: g._d. and stuff like that 

81.75 82.91 A: okay okay 

83.47 85.86 A: yeah i would agree with that um 

85.97 89.89 A: i guess i also don't like to see um 

90.47 91.11 A: i think 

92.14 93.21 A: when they started getting 

93.54 95.09 A: based in a certain 

95.63 100.77 A: you know ethnic group or you know there are sort of a line that you know 

100.99 104.04 A: you know when you when you start getting uh really 

104.16 108.62 A: pointed toward a certain group of people or or you know you can start 

109.28 110.14 A: um 

110.24 113.51 A: to me it starts becoming in bad taste or um 

112.65 116.06 B: but a lot of the times the black comedians are the ones that are doing it 

116.71 128.58 A: that is true it's yeah it is hard it just depends it depends how it depends who is doing and and and i mean if it is a stand up live comedian making black jokes 

116.78 118.68 B: to the other (( )) 

120.17 120.76 B: right 

129.27 132.33 A: you know i you know i wouldn't take it that way but if it were uh 

132.74 135.69 A: a group of white male (( )) they were making 

135.91 138.24 A: you know female jokes or making 

136.54 139.06 B: the (( )) was (( )) and everything you know 

138.56 142.26 A: yeah it i think you are right and uh i think the setting is important 

142.43 143.40 A: uh 

143.73 148.70 A: (( )) but if it were you know like in the work place i think um 

149.14 150.87 A: you know making um 

151.50 155.12 A: sexually oriented jokes to me is offensive 

155.35 155.83 B: right 

155.81 161.70 A: um making you know i think in a work place you have to be careful about any kind of 

162.12 163.25 A: jokes 

163.39 163.79 B: right 

163.47 167.44 A: you know and you have to be very careful about any racial jokes 

166.10 169.48 B: like the water k- like the water cooler jokes you know and 

169.01 170.78 A: yeah i think you have to be 

169.63 173.91 B: they used to you know they would never say offensive stuff around women 

174.48 175.01 A: uh-huh 

174.61 180.43 B: you know just the guys talking to the guys but they were always real respectful of women and now 

180.91 182.85 B: it seems like it is not that way at all 

183.03 183.50 A: right 

184.08 184.61 A: mhm 

185.26 186.16 A: uh so i think 

185.60 189.32 B: actually some of the female comedians have the worst language of all 

189.54 190.72 A: well yeah you are right 

191.16 193.93 A: and that you know i'm i'm not sure i'm not 

194.36 203.07 A: offended by some of the comedians but i you know uh to me i just don't watch it if i don't want to so it is sort of a different line of profession but um 

203.62 204.95 A: you know i i guess 

205.36 210.70 A: i i'd leave that in a different class of you know they they are in a line of business that's 

211.00 213.44 A: you know sort of a different subject of 

213.82 218.12 A: uh you know i i'll just kind of leave that as a different subject but um 

218.76 219.19 A: you know 

219.32 223.65 A: to me i you know i think you are right um i don't i don't want to hear 

223.80 224.16 A: you know 

224.34 225.24 A: particularly i'd 

225.52 227.26 A: be offended by like you said a lot of 

227.71 231.57 A: f. words and swearing and a lot of heavy profanity and 

231.75 232.50 A: um 

233.03 233.65 A: (( )) 

234.20 237.34 A: like in the (( )) and the work place i think 

237.48 239.23 A: it is inappropriate to 

239.45 240.37 A: to um 

240.64 248.18 A: you know i think one has to be very careful about what they what they say and you know personally i would still be offended 

248.30 251.68 A: um i'm not sure i would want to have friends that 

251.80 252.56 A: um 

252.90 256.57 A: you know made certain kinds of jokes um about 

257.71 258.16 A: you know 

258.86 261.02 A: you know if i continually heard jokes about 

261.27 271.47 A: certain things i i might just start to become uncomfortable or offended and start to wonder or if uh you know depending on what they were you know i don't know i mean even if 

271.93 272.54 A: you know if it was 

272.85 274.58 A: if i had friends that continually made 

274.98 275.89 A: comments about 

276.38 283.66 A: you know black people or ethnic people or things like that i might continue i might start to question their values or i might 

284.02 288.95 A: you know become uncomfortable as as having them as friends or start to wonder if 

289.13 290.42 A: you know maybe i 

290.69 291.72 A: you know am just not 

292.11 294.92 A: comfortable with their viewpoints um 

294.16 294.55 B: i 

295.63 296.35 A: um

305.80 308.14 A: you know i just don't i don't personally 

308.38 309.71 A: think it is right to 

310.02 310.67 A: be a little 

311.99 313.82 A: anybody i you know i try not to 

314.11 321.90 A: do that to any group of people i mean i don't like to make fun of any group of people i really don't i don't really think it's
