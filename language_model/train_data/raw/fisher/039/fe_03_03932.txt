4.34 9.58 B: i'm fine thank you so ah how do you tell the difference between 

9.79 12.75 B: um acceptable and unacceptable humor 

12.41 20.56 A: i i you know i think i might be the wrong person to ask about that because ah i work in a fire department so a lot of what normal 

19.69 23.76 B: so a- so any kind of humor that that goes is fine huh 

23.91 33.30 A: people yeah it's you know it's a coping method you know we deal with a lot of you know grizzly injuries and stuff like that and so a lot of things that 

33.21 44.51 A: o- ninety nine percent of people would think would be just absolutely in bad taste and disgusting really becomes a a way for us to to move on past things that that are kind of upsetting to see 

45.17 48.82 B: yeah that's very interesting to hear about um 

49.00 55.16 B: a- is it the kind of fire department where you're on duty in the firehouse for long periods of time 

54.60 58.04 A: yeah we work like right now i'm at work we work twenty four hour shifts 

57.73 58.68 B: uh-huh 

58.82 62.58 A: so i got here at seven o'clock this morning and i'll leave seven o'clock tomorrow morning 

62.67 66.15 B: wow so you you do you sleep there while you're on duty 

66.18 68.24 A: yeah yeah 

67.38 76.65 B: and w- um ah what are the other kinds of activities that you do in the firehouse i mean like do you sit around and play cards read 

76.72 79.98 A: yeah watch t._v. surf the internet you know 

80.01 80.98 A: whatever 

80.85 84.63 B: you know those things that i mentioned a lot of jokes do get told 

83.80 89.59 A: oh absolutely absolutely and you know a lot of practical jokes a lot of pranks that sort of stuff 

89.84 93.34 B: do do the pranks are an interesting case of 

93.33 105.21 B: things where what seems funny to some people might actually go too far for other people do you ever have the experience of ah some pranks getting out of hand and somebody really getting annoyed at somebody else 

104.96 115.19 A: oh a- absolutely and and it's it's very easy like you said it's very easy for what's funny to two out of the three guys or three out of the four guys that that one fourth guy 

115.05 120.57 A: can really ah you know get some people in trouble if they take it the wrong way or if they're offended and ah 

121.21 130.26 A: you know it's it's makes it a little more difficult because you are with them you know you're with people for twenty four hours at a time so it it kind of becomes like you're married to these people 

130.71 132.66 A: so um 

132.67 139.61 A: yeah pranks can can really get out of hand and and we've had cases where you know guys have been like you know what not today 

139.79 145.87 A: you know i i'm having a bad day leave me alone and and that's fine you know you have to respect that 

146.04 150.50 B: yeah sometimes ah sometimes it's a matter of ah 

151.22 156.64 B: the person that the prank is played on just ah getting pushed over the edge 

156.52 157.74 A: yeah yeah 

157.05 163.97 B: and i guess sometimes it could be a question of the people who are playing the prank just not thinking too hard about how it was going to get taken 

163.93 165.15 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

164.63 168.45 B: i i remember when i was in college once ah 

168.51 181.10 B: i was ah working the night shift in a a ice cream cone factory actually as a mechanic and there were a couple of guys that i was pretty good friends with 

181.18 194.95 B: and we would play around and tell jokes but also play jokes on each other and there was ah one night [mn] and i i was usually tired anyway because i was working a full shift after going to classes all day 

195.05 200.42 B: and ah at the end of the shift when i went to my locker to change to go home 

200.38 210.49 B: and put my shoes on i discovered that they had put like some ah grease in the bottom of my shoes when i put them on 

210.49 211.31 A: uh-huh 

210.92 218.56 B: and that was just too much at the end of a long day i'd i thought it was actually kind of over the top anyway on any day but 

217.33 218.18 A: yeah 

218.41 226.38 B: but i remember just losing it and ah i ah we were never really very good friends again after that 

226.55 227.72 A: i ah 

227.69 234.17 A: we got a guy here that he was always the first one to to kind of play these practical jokes and what not you know 

234.10 247.90 A: you'd be sitting there in the recliner and he would walk in and tip over the recliner and just always you know talking and and just doing stuff so one night i decided to get even with him and i took his car keys and i froze them in a cup of water 

248.90 252.94 A: so when he got to the morning to leave he couldn't find his keys 

253.05 263.06 A: well he never bothered to ask anybody that he was here he just said oh i i must have locked 'em in my truck or something so he calls his wife to bring him his spare set of keys 

263.50 271.78 A: then in the meantime i gave him his keys and i you know he kind of figured out what had happened and ah he went ballistic 

272.25 273.39 A: and ah 

273.65 280.02 A: man it was whole big thing and it was like you know y- if you're going to dish it out you have to be able to take it 

280.83 288.40 B: yeah well that's pretty mild anyway compared to to some things but i guess that's right some some sometimes people who ah 

284.77 286.46 A: yeah 

288.82 294.88 B: especially like to play practical jokes just ah don't like to have it go back the other way 

294.77 305.36 A: yeah and we've had people that they f- they ah you soak the guy's pillow and you put it in the freezer so he goes to go to bed at night and he can't find his pillow and then it's frozen solid stuff like that 

306.31 313.10 B: yeah i have to say ah nobody's done anything like that to me since since summer camp when i was in high school 

309.90 311.44 A: [laughter] 

313.13 318.10 B: [laughter] but i guess ah if i lived ina fire house it might it might happen if 

317.59 322.44 A: yeah i- it gets kind of sophomoric at times ah and you know it 

318.21 319.05 B: (( i if it )) 

322.51 329.91 A: getting back to the the whole what's what's acceptable and what's not you know comedy stuff ah like i said i mean we'll 

329.92 344.66 A: you know we'll see an injury you know like say a broken arm or something and just it it some some of the injuries are so grizzly that you just you have to kind of say something to to put it out of your mind otherwise it you know it just kind of haunts you 

342.15 343.02 B: (( mhm )) 

344.64 352.88 A: and ah i mean [laughter] do you want to hear some of the most tasteless jokes ever you know just stop by your local fire station and [noise] 

353.19 359.05 A: but you know for us it's it's just a way of like i said of a way of getting past it getting through it 

358.58 366.83 B: huh do people actually stop by to talk to you who aren't ah ah part of the company 

366.31 375.59 A: yeah yeah people stop by and just see how things are going you know especially after nine eleven people are a lot more aware of of fire departments of police departments and stuff 

377.79 388.60 B: that's interesting well um i guess ah if somebody wanted to make a collection of the jokes that were going around hanging around a fire house would be a real good way to find them 

387.72 391.66 A: [noise] yeah you bet it would although ah 

392.29 396.72 A: a lot of times you know you you won't hear the real good stuff because that's ah 

396.87 401.41 A: you know one of the things you don't share with the public is all the the really good ones because 

401.78 408.41 A: exactly for the reason we're talking about th- it's very easy to take this stuff out of context if you don't deal with it on a daily basis 

407.95 410.88 B: i see yeah yeah i can imagine 

411.32 413.18 B: (( i can imagine )) 

414.51 420.10 B: [lipsmack] well these days most of the jokes i hear come from my seven year old 

419.76 423.03 A: [laughter] so i'm guessing they're pretty clean 

423.52 433.90 B: yeah except in a ver- you know occasionally he'll repeat something that he's heard that um probably started out as an off color joke that he didn't get but understood differently 

433.47 435.10 A: yeah yeah [laughter] 

434.95 441.51 B: ah but um yeah mostly he and he he'll even make up jokes but he really likes them in fact ah 

441.40 447.76 B: they have once a week a day when they're ah invited to bring in a book 

447.66 456.97 B: that they'd like to share with the other kids and ah last week he brought in a book that he got a while ago called the world's worst jokes 

458.04 465.83 B: which he really appreciated but so usually when i hear a joke it's because he he brings it home and tells me 

464.36 465.04 A: (( [noise] )) 

465.71 466.73 A: i see 

467.58 468.89 B: otherwise i 

468.95 477.52 B: for some reason the people i know i like i like jokes and i like to hear them although i usually can't remember them um but ah 

477.69 482.14 B: most of the people that i'm around these days tell me lots of things but they don't tell me jokes 

482.41 483.58 A: (( ah )) 

486.44 494.14 A: well you should subscribe to ah like an internet thing where they email you a joke a day and then you could provide them to everyone 

494.23 502.02 B: yeah that's true well actually the internet is a good place to find jokes you can find jokes for every taste there i guess all kinds 

495.34 496.34 A: [laughter] 

499.96 500.86 A: yeah 

503.74 512.76 B: all kinds and um you say that ah you have ah internet connected computers at the at the fire station 

512.28 514.96 A: i i usually bring my personal laptop in 

514.26 519.50 B: i see and how you connect over the phone line or do you is there is there a network 

519.52 520.78 B: connection there 

520.59 522.46 A: no it's it's phone line 

522.69 526.52 A: which of course kills me because at home i have ah cable internet so 

526.19 527.82 B: right 

526.69 529.83 A: going back to dialup is just [mn] [laughter] 

529.92 537.72 B: yeah well really i guess if they're going to provide you with t._v. which i suppose they do to help while away the time they'd provide you with internet connection 

537.73 540.54 A: well it's a real touchy subject too because 

540.69 548.66 A: just like any employer they feel that anything you do ah on the internet of course while you're at work ah they could be liable for so 

547.87 559.16 B: oh i see yeah reflect on them so i internet's a little more active and also i guess there's stuff available that they might just as soon not learn not have the taxpayers learn they were providing 

550.85 551.65 A: yeah 

552.39 553.38 A: yeah it's 

558.97 562.77 A: yeah yeah because ah it's actually 

562.91 568.55 A: um there's a policy that says you know you're not supposed to do it while you're at work et cetera et cetera but ah 

568.32 578.29 A: you know around here the guys we just have an understanding that you know if you want to look at porno do it at home but if you need to check your email you know we you know you can check it at work that's not a big problem 

578.58 580.28 B: right 

583.70 584.60 A: so 

584.82 589.33 A: so what i where would you draw the line as far as something that was offensive 

589.61 591.34 A: as far as comedy goes 

592.40 599.89 B: well i guess if it makes some people feel bad that seems like the main criterion
