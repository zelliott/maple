240.54 241.75 B: mhm 

243.62 244.77 B: that right 

247.35 257.37 B: i i always used i used to think that when it got so bad that i said he was really paying people to get up there 'cause that stuff is not true people are not going to embarrass themselves like that [noise] 

256.67 260.28 A: [mn] and you know what you're right because i had a friend who went on that show 

260.09 260.76 B: mhm 

260.34 268.14 A: and they said the more the topic was basically true but the more they exaggerated the crazier they got the more money they would give them 

263.43 264.43 B: mhm 

266.39 266.95 B: (( [mn] )) 

267.55 269.42 B: right mhm 

268.80 282.41 A: if you start beating on your spouse or whatever you can get five six hundred dollars [laughter] so that's why it gets outrageous and people rip their clothes off and [noise] i'm sorry but i wouldn't do any of that just like you know those judge shows [mn] 

272.54 273.78 B: i know it 

276.57 277.91 B: mhm 

279.12 279.95 B: (( mm ))

282.48 283.18 B: (( [mn] )) 

285.61 286.47 B: (( [mn] )) 

287.29 288.25 B: yeah 

287.68 295.05 A: like the divorce shows and all that people get divorced for crazy reasons but [mn] ah you know some- sometimes it's pretty funny [laughter] 

294.36 303.54 B: yeah now i find some of them pretty funny and some of things that they do is unbelievable and they and most of that i guess is really true 

299.09 301.04 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

303.81 305.36 B: i used to ah 

305.52 308.83 B: be on a prayer line and the things that people would 

308.86 317.00 B: come and call in and tell me i thought it was something that you just see in a movie and it wasn't actually happening in real life but it does 

316.98 325.30 B: so some of that [noise] divorce stuff is actually true a lot of it [noise] i- you'd be amazed the things that people do 

325.45 328.29 A: [mn] [mn] i think a lot of people are desperate to get married [mn] 

327.88 329.76 B: yeah that's what i think too 

328.36 332.95 A: and they just close their eyes and then all of a sudden it becomes a comedy of errors [noise] 

330.43 331.41 B: mhm 

332.17 333.50 B: right right 

333.70 338.60 B: and they end it and they [mn] i don't know why they don't want to get out of it but anyway 

337.49 340.34 A: but they need some good shows back on t._v. like um 

340.67 347.35 A: [mn] carol burnett show and all those kind of shows you know where you didn't worry about them crossing the line 'cause they never did 

342.48 345.22 B: oh yeah those shows yeah those were the days 

346.06 347.03 B: right 

347.28 349.83 B: yeah those were the good days

389.81 391.63 B: (( right it is )) 

391.22 396.12 A: ah you know i don't like my friends to talk like that and i certainly wouldn't pay a comedian to talk like that to me 

396.12 397.86 B: i know that's right 

397.26 402.53 A: [mn] you know but [mn] i guess they feel that that's what gets the laughs [mn] 

402.43 404.51 B: (( yeah you know people )) 

403.37 405.47 A: i think a lot of it's nervous laughter [noise] 

405.11 409.25 B: yeah people are different today you know i don't know [noise] 

409.36 414.80 B: maybe it's something in the air or something they're eating or whatever [noise] they just don't think the same anymore 

414.83 416.64 B: and stuff that they 

416.96 420.74 B: ah do for fun these days is just amazing 

421.53 431.17 A: [noise] oh i know they're they're hurting somebody or or doing something like that that- that's hysterical [noise] [noise] like they had on the t._v. with those girls doing all the hazing and all that stuff 

423.55 424.21 B: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

424.84 427.08 B: mhm yeah 

430.83 432.09 B: (( [noise] right mm ))

441.12 442.02 B: (( then you )) 

443.28 454.77 B: right and then you found out the haze and stuff it is actually true that they do have people doing it even today 'cause hear recently i heard of a kid um 

455.01 458.60 B: die because they was forcing him to drink all this water 

458.71 470.10 B: i said you know this just don't make sense the things that people do to each other just to i don't know to be different or for a laugh or 

460.84 462.12 A: (( [noise] [noise] stupid [noise] )) 

467.74 469.94 A: for a laugh you know [noise] 

470.11 475.48 B: ah what it is but it's just ridiculous that's why i said has to be something in the air 

475.59 477.25 B: something that they're eating 

477.95 479.28 B: (( because )) 

479.58 484.51 B: i would imagine they've had better training than that from home you know 

483.88 487.07 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

486.37 487.92 B: but you never know 

487.71 489.72 A: [noise] that's right 

488.65 490.42 B: [noise] you never know 

491.07 499.51 A: but yeah i think comedy and people who do comedy now has really really changed quite a lot um they're either clean or they're filthy 

495.72 496.70 B: oh yeah 

497.14 498.18 B: and 

499.56 500.65 B: right 

499.69 502.50 A: i don't think there's any in between any more 

501.79 516.26 B: [mn] no it's not and [noise] and it's all because this is what the people rely on they're still making money and so i guess as long as they're making money you know and everybody that comes out they figure they got to be nastier than the one before 

515.79 517.91 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

516.58 518.94 B: (( and [noise] ah it seem like that's their goal )) 

519.40 520.14 A: (( huh ))

523.00 524.39 A: (( [noise] unreal )) 

524.12 526.46 B: mhm it is

534.72 535.91 B: yeah 

535.30 549.71 A: unrealistic [mn] you know it's like i like eddie murphy's movies [mn] some of 'em but his concerts are disgusting he is the nastiest person i don't think he likes himself 

541.68 543.01 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

549.90 553.09 A: and he hates everybody it seems like 

550.21 550.83 B: (( oh ))

560.78 564.11 A: but he's very talented he just [mn] i don't know 

564.32 568.74 A: [noise] because he doesn't need to be like that i mean he has children you 

568.80 573.93 A: would think you know somebody who has children would kinda [mn] change their act or something 

573.52 574.99 B: mhm 

574.40 578.79 A: or like andrew dice clay what is so funny about that guy [noise] 

579.11 581.58 A: i don't get it at all [noise]
