0.00 1.89 B: heather mcguinness 

1.78 4.22 A: (( [mn] rita akamatsu )) 

6.05 6.89 A: (( [cough] )) 

7.83 14.51 A: ah so ah do you find some some forms of humor a- more acceptable than others 

14.25 20.40 B: [mn] um i think there's a line that can be crossed in some circumstances whether it's 

20.52 27.09 B: you know plain comedies such as talking about your parents on t._v. i think that's like a little overdone 

27.11 30.09 B: you know i don't think it's acceptable um 

30.12 39.92 B: when people ah when they bring racism into it it's not really something that should be acceptable but i guess it's part of the norm in our society 

39.75 52.07 A: [mn] i guess but i don't like that either i don't like anything that belittles any particular group of people or any particular and what it depends on the attitude and the tone 

51.97 60.56 A: it can be done in a way where that's really not cruel but i don't like cruel humor in fact i don't like cruel humor of any kind 

59.96 61.49 B: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

60.84 65.87 A: ah you know i'm not much of a one [mn] for practical jokes because 

66.19 67.82 A: (( sometimes )) 

67.96 74.05 A: unless you know for certain that the person that you are playing the joke on thinks it's equally funny 

74.19 77.01 A: i don't think practical jokes are very funny [mn] 

77.87 86.85 A: that makes me sound like i don't have much of a sense of humor at all [laughter] [laughter] which is not true i love ah like word plays and puns and i like 

80.50 82.33 B: oh not at all no 

86.98 89.19 A: i like all you know i like 

89.46 97.33 A: comedians and and you know i love robin williams and i don't get offended easily [mn] i just don't like cruel humor [noise] 

96.67 106.66 B: no i totally agree i i don't think that it's necessary to find humor in someone else's pain you know it it just doesn't make sense to me 

106.83 117.14 A: right of course there are occasions where people [mn] can find humor in their own pain and that's not al- not a bad thing that's thinking about like 

117.17 120.26 A: um you know movies like um 

119.81 120.40 B: (( [mn] )) 

120.78 121.78 A: (( um )) 

121.88 134.82 A: i can't think of it ah like life um life is wonderful i think that's the name of it about the holocaust and the guy was always joking and [mn] yeah th- you know that sort of that sort of thing [mn] or in patch adams 

122.01 122.89 B: (( [cough] )) 

129.19 130.58 B: yeah yeah yeah 

132.96 143.49 B: well he did that well didn't he do that to you know let his son know that you know that everything was going to be okay he played a jo- like he played jokes with his son 

143.60 147.18 A: right and his but he but apparently that was kind of his 

147.15 156.24 A: his um his attitude anyway was to try to find the humor in things and i think [mn] you know i- in a bad situation that can be 

156.02 166.62 A: that can be a lifesaver actually if you can find humor in something so that's different [mn] but if you're trying to find it's other people's pain where the problem comes in 

166.63 174.24 A: when you're trying to be make jokes and things it's about other people's pain [mn] yeah i don't like that 

173.80 185.60 B: neither do it i mean if it's if it's like a personal experience [mn] i think that that's more acceptable because you're putting yourself on the line with that and you're not including someone else it's just you 

185.75 187.34 A: (( yeah exactly )) 

185.75 188.03 B: you know it's a solo act 

188.10 191.84 A: exactly [mn] it's you know what 

192.06 194.22 A: you've already agreed 

194.25 195.84 A: (( with yourself )) 

195.88 204.42 A: to find the humor and ah you know where the line is that you're not willing to cross somebody else wouldn't know that 

204.82 206.05 A: (( [mn] yeah [mn] )) 

206.22 207.49 B: exactly 

208.12 217.38 A: um what about [mn] does does language offend you or do you get offended by ah jokes about [mn] 

214.48 215.42 B: (( [cough] )) 

217.39 222.71 A: you know women and men and things like that does that offend you or do you think 

221.45 223.32 B: (( [cough] um [mn] )) 

223.58 235.71 B: i d- i really don't think it'll offend me i mean i- it's become like i don't know it's like so- in today's society i mean you even hear it on t._v. you hear curse words of all types of shapes and forms you know 

235.86 236.89 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

235.86 239.41 B: and ah i- it's like you can't avoid it so 

239.71 241.91 A: it doesn't offend me either 

241.83 242.98 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

242.10 248.67 A: but i do think sitcoms ah most sitcoms really annoy me 

248.77 250.21 A: [mn] because 

248.92 251.32 B: oh i i agree completely 

251.46 259.72 A: [laughter] because that's all that they talk about they all they talk about [mn] is like um 

252.49 254.80 B: [laughter] 

259.82 265.06 A: [mn] you know who's who's having relationships with who and ah 

265.54 266.44 A: (( ah )) 

266.89 268.74 A: y- you know um 

268.77 270.51 A: making jokes about 

271.15 273.18 A: men and women and about 

273.32 278.71 A: being players and i d- i it's just really it's just very silly 

277.16 280.99 B: it's stupid it it really is i mean i mean 

279.03 280.42 A: exactly 

281.19 286.97 B: you you you deal with enough drama in today's society you know y- you don't need to just watch it on t._v. 

287.16 297.94 B: i- it just doesn't make sense i mean like seinfeld personally stand up comedian he's great but you know anything else from that like on the t._v. show 

298.13 303.11 B: i i don't care for it it's just why put yourself in that situation 

304.25 307.33 A: yeah i agree on this most of 'em and they all 

307.66 313.63 A: seem to be alike they just change their names but the characters 

313.68 324.21 A: are not all that different from each other especially like on fox i mean almost every sitcom that they have is just like every other sitcom that they have with a different name 

324.37 329.29 A: and you could write the same script for one as you would write for another one 

329.58 330.42 A: but 

330.48 332.43 A: that to me is not humor 

332.42 334.75 B: yeah exactly i- it's 

335.10 337.86 B: [mn] it i just don't care for it that much 

337.90 341.79 B: [mn] i mean if i had to i you know i wouldn't mind going to a club and watching 

342.15 345.25 B: anyone i mean it's just i think it's humorous to like 

345.17 350.82 B: go there and see some comic that you know it's his first time and you know they're scared and they're nervous and it's just 

350.65 361.03 B: you have to be able to support them and i i just don't think that like you're you're going to find as much hilarity or whatever it is in like sitcoms 

360.46 362.36 A: so who's your favorite comedian 

362.60 364.44 B: oh jeeze [laughter] 

364.02 365.33 A: [laughter] 

364.70 365.74 B: um

370.44 372.95 B: i don't even know um 

373.34 375.05 B: i- i'd probably say 

375.33 378.89 B: like i mean he's he's like new and he's a bit 

378.95 385.01 B: bit wary and he could cut some other crap but dave chappelle is definitely up there with one of my favorites

392.97 397.52 A: but i think i like steven reich i like steven reich because he's so 

398.15 410.04 A: deadpan about his humor and he's one of those people that takes something that's like dark humor and makes it funny i like him a lot i like the way he plays with words 

406.82 408.81 B: (( yeah )) 

409.71 412.15 B: [laughter] 

410.77 415.66 A: [laughter] but and i like robin williams because robin williams is just crazy

494.47 504.82 B: most of the like most of the books that i read you know it's just they're all non fiction and i don't know it's like i don't know it's not really humorous or anything 

504.90 511.65 A: yeah [mn] well looking at it from a well i was an english major and i have a degree in english for you know a little while

512.01 515.69 A: (( looking at it from a a a a point of view of )) 

515.89 522.94 A: for a long period of time i'd say mark twain is probably one of the funniest human beings there's ever been
