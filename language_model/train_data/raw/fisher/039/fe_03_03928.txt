69.33 70.84 B: (( very specific )) 

71.78 83.39 B: on nationality or anything like that and you know that something is going to hurt get hurt i think that should be the point where you know that you know you are doing something wrong 

77.76 78.71 A: sure 

83.19 84.62 A: yeah yeah yeah 

83.64 87.17 B: i mean humor is supposed to make people laugh [laughter]

88.74 89.47 A: yeah 

89.75 91.93 B: yeah but i mean [mn] 

92.65 95.59 B: that should be the line you know it shouldn't be 

95.97 96.90 B: i mean 

97.72 101.45 B: yeah i think so what do you think i mean what 

101.04 109.65 A: well i actually was thinking about when i finally heard what the topic was i not not so long ago i read this book by ah an author called nicholson baker 

109.45 110.35 B: uh-huh 

110.17 113.34 A: and and the title of the book is is you and i a 

113.12 113.96 B: (( uh-huh )) 

113.39 123.08 A: true story nicholson baker in it he's just describing his obsession with with ah the author john updike who's a who is also an author of fiction 

122.98 124.04 B: (( oh )) 

123.65 131.04 A: and and and ah so the entire the entire book just reads like somebody who's totally obsessed and and he knows he's obsessed too 

128.70 129.63 B: uh-huh 

130.96 135.44 A: but there's this beautiful passage in the book where he's describing 

130.97 131.89 B: uh-huh 

135.34 142.43 A: i can't remember exactly what the context is for why he's describing this but i i certainly have run into this kind of situation and the situation is this 

142.33 150.49 A: where you know how some people really do use bad humor humor and bad taste kind of crass and so on and so forth 

146.60 147.74 B: uh-huh 

150.21 151.53 B: mhm 

150.91 152.10 A: (( ah but )) 

152.42 160.03 A: sometimes you notice that somebody who usually who who doesn't use bad humor doesn't use ah humor that's in bad taste will try 

159.66 160.65 B: (( mhm )) 

160.19 164.88 A: to to do something that that appeals to a sense of humor 

164.56 165.63 B: mhm 

165.16 170.47 A: l- like crass sense of humor that those other people have and they can't ever really quite pull it off
