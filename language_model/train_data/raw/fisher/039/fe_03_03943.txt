103.34 108.27 A: i like comedy clubs i i mean to me that's the kind of show i'd like to go see 

103.60 104.57 B: (( you know )) 

108.35 116.73 A: just 'cause [mn] you know like although the only thing is with comedy clubs it's really you see just as good a show on t._v. it's not like there's any big 

112.59 113.48 B: mhm 

116.98 122.80 A: you know anything showy with a comedian it's not like going to a play or something where they have great scenery 'cause 

122.90 127.03 A: the comedy clubs that i've been to it's just like you know a brick wall 

122.95 124.34 B: right 

126.98 128.01 B: (( [laughter] )) 

127.08 128.25 A: [laughter] [mn] 

128.49 131.71 A: but i went to see bill maher's show the other night 

131.73 135.14 A: you know bill maher from um politically incorrect 

131.73 132.67 B: mhm 

134.51 135.96 B: (( [mn] yes )) 

135.81 143.86 A: it was really good um it got bad reviews but a friend of mine had gets really cheap tickets so we went anyhow 

142.41 145.07 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

144.39 146.72 A: and i thought it was really worthwhile 

148.34 156.96 B: i can't wait to um see the ah new eddie murphy movie that they've got coming out what about have you seen the previews on that about the day care 

156.57 159.30 A: [mn] oh yeah i saw the previews 

160.45 162.22 A: i i like eddie murphy 

162.15 162.72 B: (( mm )) 

166.31 167.40 B: (( i ah )) 

167.91 169.96 B: what did you i went and saw 

170.16 171.20 B: um 

171.37 174.27 B: (( my big fat greek wedding what did you think of that [mn] )) 

173.92 178.90 A: you know i was sort of disappointed i mean 'cause i heard how great it was 

176.42 177.25 B: (( [mn] )) 

178.85 184.56 B: i think all the good parts were shown in the previews and then when you you saw it it was kinda like that's it [mn] 

184.06 188.96 A: and it was so predictable you sorta knew right at the beginning what was gonna happen you know 

188.15 192.31 B: right yeah i was kinda disappointed with that myself [laughter] 

189.20 190.02 A: (( ah )) 

191.56 197.77 A: [mn] yeah i think it got like a lot of hype and everybody expected it to be great so they were ready to laugh when they got there 

198.05 204.51 A: but i don't know i was sort of i called it my big fat boring predictable greek wedding movie 

202.97 207.02 B: yeah [laughter] i agree with that [laughter] 

206.63 212.30 A: i i wanna go see the new nicholson movie though i think he's really great when he does comedy [mn] 

210.65 211.68 B: [mn] ah 

212.42 226.99 B: the anger management oh i know i want to see that too there was another one i was gonna see i'm trying to remember what it was and somebody told me it wasn't as funny as it was it was kinda like going to see my big fat greek wedding but i can't remember what it was um 

213.79 215.16 A: yeah 

226.07 226.89 A: (( hm )) 

228.77 233.84 B: i don't i don't know if it was ah the two weeks notice or it was another one i don't know [mn] 

233.31 242.91 A: but i think it is true it's like they show you so many scenes now that [mn] you kind of already know what to expect a lot of times you've already seen all the good parts 

242.71 243.60 B: right 

244.05 252.12 A: and and it really surprises me too like in the theatre they'll show something that you know everybody in the theatre has already seen but they laugh anyway [laughter] 

251.45 253.58 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

252.14 255.36 A: i think that's 'cause people go and they wanna laugh so [mn] 

255.72 256.53 B: (( hm )) 

257.77 272.55 A: but i don't know i like live comedy i to me it's sort of it's kind of expensive 'cause when you go to a comedy club part of the deal is you they usually have a pretty low cover but then you have to buy a certain number of drinks and i'm not a big drinker 

272.57 273.78 A: (( but ah )) 

272.85 274.14 B: oh that hm 

274.53 278.73 A: yeah it's in fact i went to one i saw on um 

278.86 288.35 A: on that website craig's list somebody mentioned that they were doing this free show so i thought oh that sounds good so i went and it ended up costing me forty bucks in 

288.25 302.46 A: table fee and [laughter] you know [mn] i know i felt like i had to pick up the the money for it because a friend of mine came along and i had told her it was free and she wasn't really interested in going but that was the whole reason she went so i sorta got stuck 

290.64 291.86 B: oh my 

301.12 302.01 B: right 

302.41 304.25 A: [mn] but um 

303.43 304.44 B: wow 

304.33 308.45 A: yeah it's better to just watch comedy central [laughter] 

306.42 312.42 B: [laughter] yeah [laughter] i agree with that [laughter] mm 

309.81 311.48 A: but live and learn 

312.42 320.65 A: although there is something to like seeing somebody s- you know really sweating it out 'cause i think it takes a lot of courage to do that 

317.63 318.88 B: yeah 

320.06 320.62 B: (( mm )) 

320.75 324.99 B: have you been watching um the comedians on um star search competing 

324.91 326.69 A: no i haven't seen that 

326.61 338.95 B: [mn] they had but it's not really they've had a couple on there that was pretty funny um like one guy was talking about when you get telemarketing calls and stuff like that and i thought that was kind of funny but other than that it's 

339.19 343.26 B: not like watching them on ah comedy central the pros [mn] 

342.64 344.62 A: mhm yeah 

344.00 345.12 B: mhm 

344.89 349.69 A: the only thing is it's like if you watch enough of that after a while you sort of know everybody's act 

349.51 350.62 B: yeah 

349.75 355.52 A: and even like at bill maher after [mn] this girl that i went with is like a real 

355.54 356.50 A: um 

356.50 369.31 A: you know she wants to see famous people up close and get pictures and stuff and i feel stupid with it but she wanted to hang around by the stage door when he came out [mn] and when he did come out some guy came right up to him and he was like in his face and saying well 

369.07 378.82 A: i came all the way here from florida to see you and you know i wanna go see you when you're in tampa and bill maher said oh don't bother it's the same exact show [laughter] 

378.37 380.23 B: [laughter] 

380.38 381.61 B: that's true 

381.90 384.98 A: but i guess you can only write so much of that [mn] 

384.85 385.60 B: (( mm )) 

386.68 393.13 A: and a lot of it i don't even think is that you know funny i mean sometimes the most famous ones are not the most funny 

393.09 395.01 B: yeah i agree [mn] 

396.05 399.35 B: what do you think of the ah sitcoms on t._v. now 

399.31 402.69 A: [mn] um there's not too much that i watch 

402.28 409.24 B: well i agree [laughter] there's too mu- there's more reality out now and less comedy on t._v. like there used to be 

403.82 404.71 A: i mean 

409.10 423.45 A: yeah well i just i had the t._v. on one day and i didn't know anything about that mr personality show [mn] and i turned it on i thought it was like some kind of kinky show all these guys in masks you know i had the sound off and i didn't know 

416.51 417.28 B: (( ahah )) 

421.56 422.70 B: yeah 

423.41 427.35 A: i mean that seemed to me like it should have been a comedy because it was so bizarre 

427.02 428.09 B: yeah 

428.48 439.05 B: i don't know i think they're just getting you know over rated you know like like i don't know like the bachelor i've watched them and it's like discs come around it's like okay i think they're done they need to just you know 

431.57 432.56 A: mhm 

439.26 442.93 B: just not as good as it was you know the first time you know 

442.96 443.81 A: (( well )) 

443.84 448.76 A: [mn] i for a long time i lived with no t._v. and then when i finally got a t._v. 

448.65 461.72 A: i decided i didn't want to get like stuck you know addicted to it so i decided that what i would do is try to never watch anyone on t._v. that i wouldn't want to have in my home [mn] and man did that cut down on what i watched 

458.69 459.57 B: mhm 

461.42 462.59 B: (( huh [mn] )) 

462.39 465.73 A: 'cause you know most of those people i wouldn't want to have 'em in my home 

465.67 473.51 B: yeah i agree i i get more enjoyment out of i never watched um cartoons when i was a kid and now i'm watching 'em 'cause um 

473.54 478.60 B: i i have my first child and it's like it they're funnier than any other t._v. sh- 

478.15 479.93 A: oh yeah i think it's true 

478.96 480.76 B: the older ones yeah 

480.92 486.91 A: a lot of 'em i think they sort of make it more for adults anyway like the kids don't get half the jokes in it [mn] 

487.71 493.60 A: but i like the cartoons that are on sunday night you know the simpsons and futurama [mn] 

493.92 500.99 B: yeah i've seen the futurama a a couple of times i haven't i've never believe it or not watched the simpsons [laughter] 

499.50 502.09 A: oh i love the simpsons [laughter] 

501.46 502.21 B: hm 

502.83 510.19 A: i guess 'cause the characters are all so like if you watch it a few times you know the whole personality of the different characters 

509.94 510.79 B: mhm 

510.35 513.93 A: i like king of the hill too that's sort of like the same kind of thing 

513.74 514.64 B: yeah 

515.79 520.89 A: but um i personally i'd rather watch cartoons than most of the shows that are on 

521.56 524.18 B: i agree with you there a hundred percent [laughter] 

524.71 531.12 A: [mn] i mean of sitcoms i'm trying to think if there's anything that i really i guess frazier once in a while 

531.04 535.45 B: i've watched the um ah according to jem a couple of times 

535.29 536.79 A: i haven't seen that 

535.71 541.55 B: and life with barney a couple of times but i just i don't know i'm just not really into 'em any more 

541.33 542.22 A: (( ahah )) 

542.69 555.89 B: i don't know i i was kinda you know way back when i love lucy and ah the cosby show and all that it just seems like once the cosby show went off you know there wasn't too much after that that seemed funny 

555.63 556.70 A: mhm 

557.11 561.48 B: and seinfeld i never really got i never understood that [laughter] 

560.87 565.96 A: i don't like seinfeld i think 'cause i don't really like any of the characters on it you know 

565.90 566.74 B: (( mhm )) 

566.06 569.69 A: none of 'em is anyone i want to have in my apartment [laughter] 

568.30 574.15 B: ah yeah i didn't i didn't understand that show didn't get anybody just didn't make no sense [laughter] 

573.88 584.40 A: well and i actually i saw him i went to a comedy club once where [mn] it was a brand new club that was opening and it was all like small little local acts and then 

583.60 584.53 B: mhm 

584.28 595.41 A: after the last person came out seinfeld came out and did his little routine and he was the worst one i mean all these other people were funny and he was like this big famous guy and he wasn't funny at all 

591.21 591.77 B: (( [mn] )) 

596.10 596.91 A: (( [mn] so )) 

596.11 599.89 B: yeah he's the one that's making all the money it just doesn't make any sense [laughter] 

599.45 599.89 A: yeah
