0.76 2.18 A: i'm russell 

1.61 3.09 B: i'm tammy 

2.79 4.08 A: hi tammy 

3.51 4.60 B: how are you 

4.20 5.47 A: good 

4.76 7.28 B: good interesting topic tonight 

7.05 18.48 A: yeah well it's ah it's interesting in that you know everybody has a different opinion of what is acceptable and what is not acceptable in in the realm of comedy 

7.66 8.25 B: (( [laughter] )) 

19.08 23.76 B: yes and this the fact that in the different stages of your life it can change so much 

23.43 32.04 A: absolutely absolutely um i'm a former marine so ah my sense of humor has changed dramatically over the years 

31.13 37.43 B: oh definitely as well as as going from you know a teenager into motherhood with a a pre teen 

37.43 52.23 B: um you know how they change there as well and and i also come from a background of the medical profession which sometimes you know probably as as does a marine requires a bit of a warped sense of humor to just survive on a daily basis 

37.66 38.65 A: (( [mn] )) 

51.65 63.07 A: a- absolutely and now i'm i'm a teacher so i'm yeah it's a completely different world so what what's acceptable and what isn't is ah 

55.96 57.25 B: oh wow [noise] 

63.41 75.43 A: ah is is in great question um as you said it does it does happen to change quite a bit um as as we as we grow older um 

75.48 87.60 A: [cough] and it also has to do with our life experiences um 'cause prior to a- and up to and including the marine corps um you know actually 

87.85 94.90 A: i found you know that ethnic humor was funny and now i don't think it's funny anymore 

94.31 96.04 B: oh definitely 

95.61 99.06 A: you know um and ah i don't know if that's 

99.21 104.62 A: age or if that's awareness or the environment or what but it's ah 

104.35 109.81 B: d- a combination of all things and exposure to different groups probably as well 

110.49 112.63 A: oh yeah absolutely 

111.96 121.70 B: [noise] definitely yeah my i can say as far as mine my values were very rooted as early on in my childhood and so 

121.65 128.79 B: anything that was condescending or of a nature you know that morality issues [noise] 

128.33 129.55 A: mhm 

128.92 132.01 B: that would definitely draw the line there 

131.37 143.50 A: i had a little bit of a different upbringing than that i was brought up in a very much ah ah a white suburban you know neighborhood 

144.16 148.95 A: where i mean we had one black person in my entire school 

148.13 150.92 B: [laughter] we had none [laughter] 

150.00 158.55 A: yeah and ah you know and everybody was christian they were you know there there was nobody of other faiths nobody of other countries 

154.06 155.08 B: yeah 

158.60 163.89 A: um and it actually made it more difficult for me to accept 

164.11 165.85 A: ah other things 

166.10 172.83 A: so as a result you know there was always a lot of humor you know all the polack jokes and the you know 

171.85 172.70 B: yeah 

173.09 178.58 A: and there was all kinds of racial humor um that we thought was funny 

178.01 183.93 B: yeah growing up me too as well and now when when we're in a more integrated society 

184.01 187.83 B: it's [mn] i i do worry about 

188.13 195.51 B: ah what is perceived and you know what my kids did think before you know moving to a integrated area 

194.87 202.44 A: right right and an- and ah also i think another thing that has probably changed us is we're both parents 

202.16 203.60 B: yes definitely 

203.22 206.59 A: you know so that that actually makes a huge difference 

205.44 215.16 B: [laughter] yes movies that used to be funny if you pop 'em in and remembered all just the funny parts and you go to watch it with your child [laughter] all of a sudden you're going oh my [laughter] 

212.33 214.25 A: yeah yeah 

215.06 223.82 A: well i used to love monty python and the holy grail and i still do but i would never watch it with my daughter [laughter] 

217.63 219.09 B: [laughter] yes 

219.47 220.93 B: yes alone 

221.51 223.02 B: exactly 

223.65 227.29 B: that is one that we were talking about then you know a lot of the 

227.50 239.12 B: eighties eighties shows too the the breakfast club and all that kids stuff it's like i loved that movie but i will not sit down with my child and watch that [laughter] yeah 

231.57 233.46 A: right great yeah 

236.25 248.75 A: [laughter] you know but then again there's also um movies that are out now comedies that i don't find humorous at all but the kids do 

249.22 251.73 B: i didn't get the big fat greek wedding thing 

251.84 254.14 A: actually i did like that movie 

253.35 258.42 B: [mn] i i liked it for my kids but i thought i liked sweet home alabama 

258.50 260.63 A: i didn't get a chance to see that 

259.74 265.55 B: oh you need to it's very very cute [laughter] yes definitely 

262.64 264.80 A: is it yeah i'll have to check that out 

264.88 269.00 A: um but it was ah it was definitely um 

269.30 273.23 A: you know like ah for example the all the austin power movies 

272.98 274.30 B: yeah 

274.15 277.02 A: um i found some of it quite humorous 

276.78 277.93 B: mhm 

277.26 281.44 A: and then it went a little too far but the kids just can't seem to get enough of it 

280.89 284.20 B: exactly and thank goodness um most of it goes over their head 

284.08 285.01 A: yeah 

284.39 286.11 B: kind of like doctor dolittle 

286.05 287.80 A: right right 

287.22 293.95 B: thank goodness some of that goes over until they start quoting the parts that they shouldn't oh 

293.27 295.44 A: [laughter] 

294.46 300.59 B: in public the parts that are where the adult overtones but the kids didn't ah- know that so 

299.71 304.26 A: yeah they don't know that they're just they they thought it was funny so they're repeating it 

300.81 302.71 B: no they're kids 

303.53 304.46 B: yeah 

304.55 305.64 A: [laughter] 

304.77 316.96 B: and as far as me [mn] comedy as long as it doesn't go too much into the sexual overtones and as long as it doesn't have too many of the f words in it you know i'm okay [laughter] everybody needs a good laugh 

314.19 316.07 A: mhm well 

316.86 324.83 A: yeah yeah absolutely and there are times when i do have more of a 

324.84 328.15 A: um a strange sense of humor i mean 

328.52 334.07 A: there might be times when i might say you know what i'm in the mood to watch monty python 

334.85 338.61 B: exactly it's like jim carrey at ace ventura style [laughter] 

337.61 339.41 A: yeah yeah yeah 

339.45 345.36 A: i mean like jim carrey is really very very good but i have to be in the right mood for it 

344.67 346.09 B: exactly 

345.63 346.72 A: i mean 

346.82 351.75 A: my wife won't even come close to the movie dumb and dumber 

351.19 352.28 B: [laughter] 

352.30 358.00 A: she won't even touch that movie with a ten foot pole and i actually agree with her on that one 

357.64 358.85 B: yeah 

358.24 361.41 A: um but like ace ventura i thought was hilarious 

360.82 362.72 B: yes definitely 

361.98 368.61 A: you know um but once again that is not something that i would expose a very young child to 

368.31 377.77 B: exactly it's definitely and it just depends i mean you know i don't know i i don't the the movie spoofs like the well 

378.05 381.54 B: kung pow enter the fist or whatever you know the 

381.13 382.39 A: mhm 

381.78 391.19 B: all those i have to be in the right mood to watch those oth- otherwise but my husband he just rolls on the floor i mean anytime there's one out there he is 

390.34 392.19 A: [laughter] 

391.73 400.22 B: i i can't e- i can't go to the theater with him because it's too embarrassing [laughter] but he has a good time so that's okay 

392.28 393.42 A: he likes those 

395.51 397.94 A: [laughter] 

399.56 402.28 A: that's half of it that's half of it right there 

401.90 408.09 B: it's all right so yeah i mean we love watching that whose line is it anyways on t._v. 

407.67 409.31 A: yes yes 

408.43 410.99 B: [mn] that is not one 

409.93 412.78 A: now they push the envelope a little bit too 

411.39 417.86 B: they push it a lot [laughter] with my pre teen watching and i can see the wheels turning but 

413.15 415.37 A: [laughter] 

417.51 419.68 A: yeah well um 

417.94 424.52 B: then again that provides opportunities for discussions [laughter] i guess in a controlled setting that's a 

421.15 422.69 A: right right 

424.73 427.94 B: good way to break some of that up [laughter] 

427.52 429.60 A: (( yeah )) 

428.87 431.94 B: if you need to do all that good stuff 

432.02 433.32 A: yeah that's true 

433.49 435.55 A: um yeah it's 

433.50 434.14 B: yeah 

436.20 439.03 A: it's also you know it's 

439.52 444.74 A: like some of the comedians though lose something if they're censored 

443.95 445.62 B: (( [noise] yes )) 

445.30 447.31 A: um like george carlin 

445.75 446.95 B: chris rock 

447.04 448.55 B: yes oh yeah 

448.49 456.69 A: love george carlin but he has a filthy mouth and you can't put him on network t._v. 

449.53 450.44 B: yes 

456.37 457.88 B: no you can't 

457.23 460.07 A: least it it wouldn't be near as funny 

459.37 463.41 B: yeah they were boycotting him when we lived in idaho 

460.18 461.23 A: um 

463.72 473.12 B: there was a bit stink about him and you know it was the fact of freedom of speech and if you don't like his style don't go but don't throw a fit and deny other people the opportunity 

472.98 473.95 A: right 

473.38 474.61 B: and so 

474.84 478.36 B: that was at least my personal opinion you know if somebody wants to see him 

478.83 490.27 B: and you know you're in a c- very conservative state well you know that doesn't mean there shouldn't be opportunities for him to be there for you know people that want to see him obviously there was a big enough demand 

490.51 491.33 A: yeah 

490.54 494.97 B: and he did come and perform but oh they threw such a ruckus 

495.12 500.74 B: and i just thought you know you're not being forced to watch him you don't have to buy the ticket so [laughter] 

500.98 503.78 A: exactly exactly 

501.35 506.51 B: yes i mean there's the censorship can go a little far as you know 

506.67 510.02 B: but he's good i mean he he's good [laughter] 

509.77 510.77 A: (( [laughter] )) 

511.02 511.66 B: [mn] 

511.45 524.97 A: oh well like there's [sigh] oh what's the name of that there's a movie that's out that has people um where they're doing stupid stuff and they're really getting hurt and i can't remember the name of it 

523.88 529.74 B: oh yeah the the dumb the dumbass movie or whatever [noise] and stuff 

528.89 532.53 A: yeah something like that jackass the movie that's it 

529.94 531.08 B: yeah 

531.32 533.56 B: yeah yeah that one 

533.89 539.08 A: that is ludicrous but for some reason it's making tons of money 

538.48 540.65 B: yeah that's just poor taste 

539.72 545.70 A: um i don't think i don't consider that humor because people are truly getting hurt 

541.30 542.82 B: that's i don't 

545.10 545.94 B: yeah 

546.00 547.08 A: and 

546.06 547.27 B: and it's and 

547.43 551.10 B: comedy has to be have a spontaneous nature to it 

551.45 552.35 A: right 

551.51 556.67 B: it all that is like set up you know i- it doesn't even look real 

557.28 562.05 B: it has to for me to enjoy it anyway it has to have a spontaneity about it 

561.85 563.53 A: right 

562.64 568.16 B: and some things [mn] those are just insincere they rank right up there with the movie cops you know 

568.06 569.97 A: right [laughter] 

568.34 576.98 B: [laughter] like cop shows on t._v. that drive me insane [laughter] i don't know the virtual reality give me you know there's too much 

577.09 586.64 B: you know live action stuff and all that stuff going on reality t._v. is just in our face in the news everyday we need some nice escapes [laughter] 

586.33 587.94 A: right right 

586.79 592.17 B: in comedy and something just to lift your heart and your spirits and not weigh you down 

592.46 596.73 B: and that's exactly uh some of that stuff out there 

596.96 599.89 B: we try to go to the movies when there good family
