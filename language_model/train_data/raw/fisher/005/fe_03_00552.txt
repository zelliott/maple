441.58 441.91 B: well 

442.15 445.16 B: well other than reality t._v. i think it 

445.43 446.67 B: just basically people 

447.13 452.67 B: doing something different and people who want to get into other people's business and 

453.14 456.29 B: basically sometimes they just don't have a life and then they 

456.73 458.52 B: they want to go on a show like that 

458.88 459.32 A: mhm 

459.36 464.61 B: to earn money or like um probably these people another reason these people on um 

464.94 468.64 B: american idol they might be going on there just to see paula or you know 

469.02 474.32 B: to make fools of themselves maybe get an autograph i don't know that is what i would do if i was going to make a fool out of myself 

469.07 470.05 A: right

508.37 508.87 B: yeah 

508.60 509.03 A: you know 

509.87 510.65 A: i i um 

510.76 514.15 A: i don't know if i would be able to handle that day after day 

513.63 517.36 B: yeah i think it is next tuesday it comes on is it eight thirty or is it eight o'clock 

517.25 520.03 A: o._k. so it is eight o'clock yeah it is at eight o'clock 

520.21 520.84 B: eight o'clock 

520.47 526.16 A: yeah because yeah because i actually um went up to bed around nine and it was over so yeah it starts at eight

530.66 531.27 A: oh o._k. 

531.11 533.60 B: because i used to love star search when i was younger 

532.53 533.67 A: (( )) 

533.79 535.00 A: yeah yeah yeah 

534.34 537.47 B: and now it is back and it's on it's supposed to be on tonight too 

537.78 538.41 A: oh o._k. 

538.44 545.44 B: so to me that is reality t._v. that is that is good star search is good for the simple fact it has modeling it has comedy it has it all 

538.71 539.00 A: (( )) 

539.19 539.87 A: (( )) 

540.46 541.98 A: (( )) yeah

547.09 548.54 B: american idol i mean 

547.18 547.87 A: (( )) 

548.72 552.01 B: it doesn't have but singing and let us put down a lot of people 

558.31 562.63 A: and and (( )) productions need um you know they need to make their money and i think that 

562.91 565.73 A: you know that is why they are sitting down and coming up with these ideas 

565.16 565.76 B: right 

566.01 570.05 B: telephone companies too because american idol makes a lot of their money from telephone calls
