60.39 60.82 B: bec- 

60.58 62.45 A: hopefully 

61.78 64.63 B: because do you have much more to say about gossiping 

65.99 67.32 B: other than the fact that it's 

68.11 69.33 B: not the nicest thing to do 

69.85 76.24 A: uh i work with a bunch of women and i and i deal with it all day long and it drives me absolutely insane 

76.92 81.16 A: um it just is one of those things in life that nauseates me 

81.67 86.63 A: i mean i i don't smoke i did it one time and and i drink um casually but 

87.20 88.06 A: you know that's a 

88.25 91.95 A: again it's just more detrimental to your health and it's more of a personal choice 

93.22 93.95 A: to um 

94.12 97.29 A: to gossip constantly you know which i mean we're all guilty of it 

94.15 94.51 B: yeah 

98.14 98.55 A: i- it 

98.67 100.30 A: it gets old 

100.52 101.90 A: you get sick of it 

100.91 101.26 B: yeah 

102.37 103.41 B: well for me um 

104.35 104.63 B: the way 

104.72 105.23 B: for me i'm 

105.43 106.42 B: in college and 

107.33 107.79 B: so 

108.30 108.80 B: um 

109.08 112.25 B: it's a little different i mean it's not a workplace type of thing and 

113.06 113.49 B: i'm not 

113.98 114.80 B: surrounded by 

115.14 116.20 B: specifically women 

116.53 120.01 B: all the time so it's like a little different a little bit of a different dynamic but it's a 

120.21 121.79 B: pretty much of a small community 

121.94 122.45 A: mhm 

122.51 122.92 B: so you 

123.09 123.75 B: there's like a 

123.97 125.88 B: very you know nice little river mill or 

126.25 128.60 B: you know if something happens everyone finds out really fast 

129.19 132.45 B: (( a thing )) when someone starts going out with someone else you know very quickly 

133.10 134.79 B: and that type of stuff and also 

135.42 139.54 B: i'm like and orthodox jew and so there's like this whole set of laws regarding gossip 

140.09 141.36 B: you know it's just like the type of 

141.81 143.07 B: things you're supposed to engage in and what 

143.07 146.27 B: permitted about talking about someone else what's not permitted and 

146.59 146.97 A: mhm 

146.79 147.72 B: so i spent like a lot 

147.97 148.98 B: like i have no there's like 

149.20 152.54 B: all these different parts of speech i spent a large part of my life just learning about 

153.27 153.60 B: so 

154.35 156.95 B: mean it's not just like gossiping in general like 

157.26 163.26 B: can you like even if you should like can you even compliment someone excessively in front of someone you know that they don't like 

163.43 164.26 B: that doesn't like them 

164.50 168.75 B: -cause that will just cause the other person to speak badly about them -cause you know that they don't the other person doesn't like them 

164.61 165.11 A: mhm 

169.03 169.98 A: mhm mhm 

169.56 170.81 B: you know so that type of stuff 

172.17 172.89 B: yeah that's what i've 

173.39 174.13 B: i 

174.52 177.56 B: don't have such strong opinions other than the fact that i'm not so 

178.08 180.26 B: i don't think gossip is that fascinating just because 

180.44 181.90 B: if it doesn't concern me 

182.07 183.27 B: i don't need to talk about it 

182.25 182.87 A: right 

183.45 184.60 A: right right 

192.82 197.20 A: i don't know whether that would actually be classified as gossiping or not you know 

197.60 200.21 A: i guess if you really boil it down it is you know 

200.74 201.04 B: well 

201.20 202.62 B: yeah and also 

203.02 203.47 B: i mean 

203.87 205.26 B: i live in a dorm and 

205.97 206.65 B: you know it's 

207.31 207.77 B: (( and a lot of it )) 

207.88 208.33 B: roommates 

209.24 209.74 B: get along 

220.82 221.28 A: mhm 

223.09 227.92 B: -at's just going to happen because you spend so much time around a group of people and that is just going to happen 

227.99 228.57 A: right 

228.83 230.04 A: well i mean and there's eh 

230.48 234.29 A: obviously there would be different kinds too there there are um 

235.58 236.15 A: you can be s- 

236.29 241.07 A: very vindictive with it and you can just be opinionated with it as well i guess you know if you 

241.77 242.85 A: look at it that way 

243.16 249.03 B: yeah and it could just be like and offhand remark like i was just wrapping something for a bake sale and our friend called and he was just like oh 

249.15 249.47 B: i'm not 

249.57 250.12 B: doing it 

250.72 251.11 A: yeah 

251.06 253.40 B: and then when he hung up we're like are you shocked 

253.49 253.90 B: we were like 

254.26 256.34 B: no brian is the laziest person on earth 

257.01 262.07 B: and it was like at this point we know him for so long and it was just not even mean it was almost affectionate 

262.31 262.80 A: mhm 

262.52 265.64 B: the way we were saying it of course it wasn't a nice statement but it was just 

266.00 268.49 A: but you accept the person for who they are you know and 

268.68 270.89 B: yeah i would we were surprised that he volunteered 

270.99 272.31 B: you know 

271.15 271.49 A: yeah 

271.99 277.42 A: and he probably wouldn't take it personally if he heard you say that either you know he'd probably say yup i am 

275.25 276.09 B: -ull -cause we say it 

277.08 279.90 B: -cause we say it to his face at this point you know 

278.52 279.13 A: yeah 

279.53 279.97 A: yeah 

280.83 282.61 B: but like that type of stuff you know 

282.92 283.55 B: you know how 

285.52 288.79 B: but yeah and some points you know i think the worst is when you're like 

289.13 290.88 B: talking about someone and you're like always nervous 

290.99 291.32 B: like the 

291.41 292.13 B: (( reality )) check 

292.86 294.21 B: check around to make sure if they're 

295.16 297.79 B: you know you're saying something really bad when you start doing that 

296.65 297.16 A: yeah 

297.46 302.54 A: yeah you look to make sure the coast is clear that's horrible 

301.61 306.38 B: i'm sure everyone's had their one or two experiences when someone has actually walked in as they were talking about them 

306.90 308.66 A: yeah and and that is um 

308.91 312.87 A: extremely uncomfortable and embarrassing and then you really have to 

313.07 315.87 A: just kind of check yourself and say well okay 

316.58 318.40 A: you know i kind of deserved that you know 

319.57 319.84 B: but 

320.84 323.06 B: i mean it's like and you always think about how 

323.39 325.30 B: uncomfortable and embarrassing it was for you 

325.86 326.19 B: then you 

326.28 329.14 B: you almost forget like how much worse it was for the person 

329.48 329.96 A: mhm 

330.17 331.58 B: just walked in heard some really 

331.81 333.05 B: bad things being said about them 

333.24 333.68 A: yeah 

333.75 334.77 B: and if you're saying it to 

334.91 337.22 B: this group of people then imagine how another group of people 

337.34 338.58 B: they're imagining getting upset too 

339.29 339.97 A: that's true 

339.90 340.19 B: and 

340.37 341.72 B: if this is what you're thinking 

341.84 343.87 B: then a lot of people might be thinking that also 

344.21 344.73 A: mhm 

345.14 345.45 B: so 

345.84 346.52 B: it's just like 

346.68 348.19 B: because you in those situations like 

349.31 349.76 B: you know 

349.96 352.13 B: you always think about how you felt in that situation 

352.61 354.02 B: and you forget that like other people 

354.80 358.55 B: like you were actually doing something mean to somebody else and they just happened to catch you doing it 

359.29 359.80 A: yeah 

359.96 360.49 A: yeah 

360.61 361.07 A: really 

363.01 365.91 A: i wonder if we get to go on to a different topic 

365.64 366.67 B: i think we do like 

367.21 369.46 B: i mean first of all there were the other things on the lists i guess 

369.61 370.05 B: but like 

371.12 372.17 B: i think i mean 

372.36 373.11 B: can like c- 

373.39 373.78 B: are we 

373.94 378.82 B: beating gossip to death it's not something we want to do it's something we all do because it's human nature 

379.02 379.55 A: mhm 

379.71 382.33 B: because we're surrounded by people we're just going to end up talking about them 

382.69 383.09 B: you know 

383.57 384.90 B: more interesting than the weather 

385.36 386.11 A: definitely 

386.47 386.74 B: but 

386.61 387.28 A: definitely 

388.59 388.97 B: i mean 

389.50 392.81 B: but didn't they say you know when we were like signing up that like you could start like 

392.96 394.82 B: the topic is more like a jumping off board 

396.28 397.03 B: go with something else 

397.52 399.34 B: i recall that being said in the sign up 

400.17 401.15 B: but like maybe i'm wrong 

401.70 402.07 B: says that 

401.89 402.79 A: i don't know 

402.32 403.82 B: did you sign up on line or on the phone 

405.65 406.34 A: if um 

406.51 407.02 A: i looked at 

407.24 408.18 A: through i looked at 

408.84 411.36 A: at it very briefly because they had called earlier 

411.91 414.75 A: when i didn't have my pin number and um 

414.92 418.71 A: i guess they called back you know once or twice more 

419.11 421.67 A: um there was something on my answering machine too so 

421.47 424.72 B: yeah they put me on hold so i didn't like being put on hold so i hung up 

425.23 425.59 A: yeah 

426.25 427.02 B: and 

427.16 427.59 B: you know 

428.39 428.79 A: huh 

428.47 428.84 B: but i 

429.42 429.68 B: but 

430.45 431.31 B: i mean i think that 

432.15 433.63 B: i mean gossip is 

434.63 436.31 B: gossip is gossip it's just like a 

436.56 437.53 B: stupid topic 

437.62 438.14 A: mhm 

438.70 442.76 B: i mean is it detrimental for society to a mean spirited person blah blah blah 

443.31 443.96 B: you know like 

444.21 444.63 B: that's it 

445.29 445.83 B: you know that 

446.02 447.07 B: i think you just beat it to death 

447.25 447.61 B: and 

448.04 449.03 B: the other stuff we're also 

450.36 455.13 B: smoking is bad for health drinking is bad for your health over eating is bad for your health exercise is good for your health like 

456.64 459.13 B: do you remember anything else on the list even that they mention 

458.96 461.27 A: that's the same ones i remember 

461.58 462.71 B: because those are the ones that stick out 

464.44 465.44 B: they didn't mention druggies 

466.14 466.87 A: no 

467.75 468.89 B: that'd be more interesting 

469.31 474.66 A: or just plain out losers that don't want to work that take advantage of society 

475.01 475.54 B: no -cause like 

475.64 476.76 B: drug use is like 

477.30 477.59 B: we talk- 

477.98 479.05 B: -juana

483.51 486.19 A: well you're in college i'm sure you know i mean 

486.15 488.95 B: i haven't i don't do any of this stuff i just think it's interesting 

487.81 488.28 A: yeah 

489.55 492.73 A: but it has to be right under your nose all the time too you know 

492.52 493.92 B: literally 

493.74 496.78 A: and i mean in the clubs and stuff like that too i'm just like sure 

497.18 497.65 B: yeah
