361.59 362.42 B: and all day i kept 

361.86 362.17 A: right 

362.55 364.90 B: worrying about her and calling the vet 

365.25 368.19 A: yeah after i did that too because we got a male and a female 

368.38 370.65 B: oh 

369.06 370.66 A: and we let them have a litter 

370.85 371.95 B: oh really hm 

371.59 373.54 A: yeah and then we got them both fixed 

373.89 374.63 B: uh-huh 

374.31 377.14 A: and after we got her fixed i almost regretted it 

377.34 378.96 B: oh i know 

378.21 382.32 A: because she she turned into this mean li- little witch you know 

382.16 383.35 B: huh 

382.79 389.21 A: but but she's okay now it took her quite a few months it took her probably three or four months before she got back to normal 

389.41 390.22 B: mhm 

390.16 395.10 A: you know back to her sweet self because all the hormonal thing that was going on with her she was mad 

395.42 400.87 A: she was mad she was like what what'd you do you know she just had a attitude about her for a few months you know 

400.71 402.40 B: gu- i've got my 

401.81 404.71 A: and i thought god i ruined my sweet little kitten you know 

411.12 421.65 B: she had a litter of kittens and then i got her fixed and she is just an absolute psycho you'll be petting her and she'll be purring and then all of a sudden she bite back 

416.79 417.52 A: oh yeah 

421.39 422.65 A: yeah that's what this one did 

421.79 424.38 B: really oh 

423.73 429.35 A: yeah and i thought oh my god i ruined her she's going to be mean like this forever but she didn't she got over it 

429.12 430.48 B: huh 

430.29 435.39 A: and now she's back to the sweet you know you can rub her belly and all that kind of stuff again it's just back to being sweet 

436.05 438.16 B: well maybe there's hope 

436.55 441.37 A: i never thought i never thought of the mental repercussions when you fix an animal you know 

441.14 443.86 B: yeah 

442.14 447.29 A: but they go through it they go through some kind of a thing and uh and it makes them angry 

447.55 448.28 B: huh 

449.07 453.57 B: maybe there's hope for my cat then because she's just been like that for a few months and 

453.17 456.47 A: yeah she if she just got spayed give her a few months and she'll get over it 

467.94 468.70 A: uh-huh 

469.14 470.17 B: (( yeah some )) 

469.82 470.18 A: yeah 

470.41 471.88 A: hormonal imbalance 

470.43 471.09 B: can 

472.05 475.44 B: oh well i can relate to that so 

476.22 481.65 A: i never thought of that you know i just thought oh you know you get them spayed no more kittens i never thought about what it would do to her 

481.97 482.73 B: yeah 

482.41 484.60 A: oh i mean how she would go through it you know 

484.89 485.66 B: right 

485.77 491.77 A: then after after i realized that i thought oh god what did i do you know now she's going to be mean she's not going to be sweet anymore 

485.80 486.25 B: huh 

491.91 492.75 B: mhm 

492.86 495.55 A: but she got over it she's right back to her old self again 

496.29 497.14 B: (( well )) 

497.28 498.99 B: gives me some hope 

498.22 502.77 A: the ma- the male on the other hand he's half siamese so he's kind of temperamental anyway 

502.40 506.35 B: oh yeah 

503.81 508.67 A: ah he's was really lovey when we first got her and after they had their kittens and everything and now he just hates her 

508.84 509.71 B: oh 

509.54 512.41 A: he stalks her and he attacks her and he beats her up 

512.40 514.11 B: oh my god
