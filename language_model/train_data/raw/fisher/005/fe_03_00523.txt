81.44 82.20 B: (( mm )) 

83.13 89.40 B: yeah it's sort of strange talking to a you know a stranger about personal habits huh i was like oh okay 

86.70 96.96 A: [laughter] yeah i know i was li- i was wondering as soon as it said personal habits i'm like uh-oh are they going to ask me what my personal habits are and [laughter] yeah 

95.30 98.41 B: right right i guess we're supposed to discuss 

99.10 102.93 B: discuss what did they say what what did we think was worse so 

101.98 108.47 A: yeah and and i would say i don't know smoking's pretty bad drinking's bad of course gossiping 

108.87 119.91 B: yeah i i would think you know everything that they listed is bad because it hurts somebody you know if it's it whether it's your you know yourself personally healthwise or 

114.03 115.10 A: right 

120.02 126.74 B: you know other people as far as feelings and getting hurt whatever passing on things that shouldn't be passed on [laughter] 

120.18 120.80 A: (( hm )) 

123.96 125.10 A: yeah 

126.23 131.31 A: exactly and not exercising that's a big one too but i'm bad at that too 

130.83 140.13 B: i i i i'm very bad at not exercising i you know put it on my list of things to do you know all the time and it you know just sort of gets passed over oops don't have time for that [laughter] 

135.42 136.63 A: i know 

137.74 148.02 A: oh i know exactly exactly i have i have two smaller kids and so it's it's kinda hard to fit that in but it is you know it's important but 

147.67 148.73 B: mhm 

148.37 152.87 A: and it's important to show your kids that you want to take of your- yourself too 

152.47 163.69 B: yeah i think that's that's probably [sigh] very important in that time flies by i mean my kids are both in college so it's a little too late at this point for me to [laughter] 

160.46 164.72 A: oh really wow wow yeah that's yeah 

164.34 170.87 B: [sigh] at this point they have picked up whatever bad habits i have given them [laughter] 

167.81 172.53 A: (( [sigh] [laughter] ooh boy )) 

173.02 175.04 A: so um yeah 

175.11 179.26 A: um [mn] you know what i i actually um 

179.54 193.94 A: i used to smoke and and my parents you know they were like my dad smoked too and my mum is like so against it and she's always saying you know you have to you know to take care of your body more and like don't don't smoke it's bad for you 

184.99 186.27 B: mhm 

193.94 197.72 A: so like that i mean that's a huge problem i think for me 

196.57 205.77 B: yeah yeah both of my parents smoked when i was growing up and i used to um you know like if i had to write a report on something i'd do it on you know like 

205.54 214.46 B: you know the horrors of smoking and make them proof read it for me [laughter] [laughter] not really not really i think eventually my dad gave it up 'cause 

208.32 212.72 A: oh really did it work [laughter] 

214.32 217.82 B: you know he just wanted to be healthier and my mum just got 

217.66 229.77 B: didn't give it up until she got really sick one day and you know couldn't smoke for a while i guess and then finally gave it up but i kept saying you don't want to smoke in front of your grandchildren do you do you want them to smoke 

221.03 222.28 A: (( oh gee )) 

223.99 225.21 A: yeah 

229.42 238.51 A: yeah [laughter] really wow yeah that's that's kinda hard but you know what i think nowadays like um like i have a girlfriend that actually 

230.20 232.09 B: (( [laughter] )) 

238.43 241.91 A: smokes but she just got pregnant again for the second time 

241.41 242.39 B: mhm 

241.81 253.94 A: and she quits those nine months but as soon as she has the baby like she's you know smoking again of course she doesn't smoke around the kids but i'm like thinking you know if you can give it up for nine months i think you could just give it up 

252.80 261.60 B: you you would think so because i mean it's not just [mn] when you're pregnant i mean they're around all that secondhand smoke so you would think that would be bad for them 

254.56 255.42 A: but 

261.26 262.95 A: exactly and 

262.08 269.93 B: i know i had a sister in law who was like oh i'm gonna smoke it makes the baby smaller and it'll be better for me and i'm like okay and why are you having children 

266.80 268.38 A: oh great 

269.50 277.38 A: oh my god yeah that's not good [laughter] that's not good yeah wow i can't believe that 

271.80 272.96 B: [laughter] 

277.10 284.29 B: mm i know my daughter keeps saying well how do you give up things like caffeine while you're pregnant i'm like well [laughter] 

283.16 296.28 A: [laughter] you either do or you yeah i know that was a big one but you know like caffeine i don't know like i think that i i'm okay with a cup of coffee in the morning and like even when i was pregnant with my kids my 

296.13 306.37 A: my doctor said you know don't don't worry about it if you have a cup a day it's not going to be bad but i mean i would imagine if you like smoked a pot or yeah 

300.12 301.20 B: right 

305.97 306.80 B: [laughter] 

306.43 310.98 A: smoked or drank a pot a day that would be pretty bad but i don't know 

308.82 309.89 B: right 

310.78 315.48 B: i guess so i don't know i g- at this point in time i couldn't imagine giving up my coke so 

315.33 324.32 A: yeah exactly yeah it's kinda hard to just go like and give up the caffeine for me at least i n- i need at least a cup a day 

324.31 325.37 B: mhm 

324.93 328.38 A: but i don't think that's so terrible terrible [mn] 

327.03 332.46 B: right well i think all the things on this list are like things that you know people know they shouldn't do 

332.18 333.61 A: exactly 

332.72 335.53 B: but they tend to be things that 

336.10 337.07 B: um 

337.92 338.80 A: you just 

338.06 346.05 B: i guess uh can be sort of addictive or you know or you get you know you you you get something else out of them besides just just doing them so 

340.48 341.62 A: yeah 

345.67 347.14 A: exactly 

346.53 348.00 B: they're hard to give up 

347.81 349.74 A: yeah exactly 

351.59 360.26 A: i don't know it would be nice if i could give up all those things at least you know the the um you know or start doing the things that i should be doing but i don't know [sigh] 

355.01 356.25 B: mhm 

363.32 365.72 B: [sigh] mm so how old are your kids 

364.89 367.12 A: um four and two

370.13 373.85 A: yeah they're actually my daughter is is the two year old 

373.73 386.55 A: and she's now just starting to realise that she can fight back with her brother so [laughter] so she's and he's not liking it at all but i'm thinking you know what he kinda deserves it [laughter] 

378.11 378.65 B: (( ooh )) 

386.32 401.01 B: my my daughter was also the youngest and they're a little under two years apart and she got to the point where she was very good at playing the victim and it took us a while to realise that she [laughter] was doing it [laughter] she liked to get her big brother in trouble [laughter] 

396.00 398.97 A: oh my god [laughter] that's funny ooh 

399.53 406.12 A: i i used to do that too i had a brother that was two years older than me and i was always getting him in trouble 

405.61 406.65 B: (( mm )) 

406.39 409.21 A: now it's i don't know he's probably 

409.70 418.21 A: he's probably like h h he's probably getting back me somehow you know he or he probably will get back at me somehow and get me in trouble for something i don't know [sigh] 

418.84 422.82 B: [mn] [mn] i was an only child so i was totally unprepared for [sigh] 

421.25 424.82 A: oh wow yeah that's got to be 

423.54 425.16 B: al- altogether 

425.16 436.72 A: yeah i have three brothers and a sister so and we sat and i was the youngest so i was like always picked on it seemed like so and then when i got older i got you know a little wiser 

431.89 433.22 B: mhm 

437.65 438.78 A: (( but [sigh] )) 

439.81 446.71 B: [mn] mm so i wonder how how how much they want us to stick [laughter] to this topic i don't how long can you about 

444.37 446.52 A: i don't know i i heard it 

446.90 448.64 B: you know um 

447.63 449.26 A: yeah 

449.22 454.29 B: things like overeating and smoking and gossiping 

449.86 451.03 A: i don't know 

453.18 463.40 A: yeah i mean it's pretty obvious like a- any of th- any of those things are you know bad things to do i mean i think it's just all a matter of how much you do it too you know what i mean like 

463.91 473.48 A: if you i mean if you have a glass of wine a day i mean i don't think that's bad but um you know you know overindulging yourself on anything you know with fat 

467.61 469.07 B: (( oh no uh-uh )) 

473.73 474.98 A: (( um i don't know )) 

475.53 483.65 B: i suppose even if with smoking if you could keep yourself down to a cigarette a day or something it probably wouldn't be horrible either but i don't 

480.72 481.75 A: right 

482.64 488.69 A: right and not and do it outside or you know something you know anything like that i mean 

484.84 485.89 B: right 

488.99 500.16 A: an- and with uh [sigh] i don't know with exercise i mean as long as you i mean as long you're like not like sitting on your butt all day i mean i think that you're doing something but i don't know 

496.90 498.19 B: right 

501.57 509.71 B: yeah running up and down the stairs twenty times a day [laughter] mopping floors and all those kinds of things must count for something [laughter] 

503.82 505.63 A: [laughter] exactly with 

505.71 508.28 A: with my kids exactly 

508.33 517.39 A: the vacuuming exactly all those things i think that's a little bit of exercise but i think yeah but i think if you're not doing anything at all that's pretty bad but 

516.67 517.82 B: mhm 

517.62 518.63 A: um 

518.81 520.70 A: (( i don't know an- and )) 

521.19 523.23 A: i don't know what else they were saying 

523.78 528.47 B: yeah i tried to jot a few down but they sort of rattled them off pretty quickly there 

527.96 529.36 A: yeah 

529.92 534.75 A: i don't know i just i just remember like smoking and overeating and 

535.06 538.56 A: all those things came in mind 'cause of course they're not good for you 

538.22 539.17 B: right 

538.82 539.64 A: but 

543.68 548.57 A: so this this is supposed to be for ten minutes right i i think they're supposed to like come in and 

548.86 552.95 A: and this is all recorded too right [laughter] 

550.43 562.90 B: yeah right [laughter] yeah i had i had heard that they come at some point they come in and say you know wrap it up or something along that line and let you know that you're getting at the end so
