184.80 187.42 B: yeah my neighbourhood you know the people i know here 

188.10 191.33 B: so there's no one i really can confide in

193.05 194.84 A: yeah i don't really try 

195.45 200.83 A: you know you try once or twice and people don't keep your confidences so

212.60 217.30 B: and you know come to find out they're the ones backstabbing you and talking about you 

217.91 220.45 A: i think it's the most widespread problem 

220.28 222.68 B: yeah i agree 

222.29 230.79 A: 'cause it crosses every [sigh] race and gender and um financial group you know it 

230.85 233.15 A: doesn't matter how rich you are or 

233.13 234.38 B: yeah

234.78 237.26 B: or how poor or whatever or what color 

237.03 238.00 A: yeah 

237.39 241.93 B: you know and [sigh] it doesn't m- m- matter if you're male or female 

241.95 244.08 B: it crosses both genders 

243.79 245.54 A: yeah 

244.66 250.22 B: so even though females tend to gossip more than men but that's just my 

249.27 255.47 A: not around here [sigh] yeah [sigh] men are real chatterboxes around here 

250.51 251.89 B: oh really 

255.43 258.67 B: [laughter] that's very un- unusual i mean 

259.01 265.98 B: or maybe it's not i just i'm just n- not around a lot of men like since since i've had her i'm a single mom 

266.22 269.89 B: and men are kinda like [mn] well my shit left so
