0.66 1.88 B: hi my name is kim 

2.19 3.60 A: and my name is rosemary 

5.74 6.43 A: and 

6.91 9.22 A: i believe that iraq should be disarmed 

10.71 12.18 B: well i happen to agree with you 

12.28 17.19 A: oh well this may not be a long con- as long as they want the conversation to be 

19.84 21.35 A: i think it should be a priority 

21.49 22.10 A: and uh 

22.77 23.13 A: you know 

25.91 29.88 B: how they've treated other nations before 

30.19 32.84 B: and i don't think that they're getting any better 

32.86 34.00 A: no and i don't know that 

34.15 34.52 A: i 

34.64 36.94 A: i'm quite certain that they cannot be trusted 

37.56 38.37 B: exactly 

39.03 39.45 A: they haven't 

40.03 41.04 A: proven to me 

41.15 41.56 A: any 

41.85 42.46 A: reason 

42.63 45.25 A: haven't shown me any reason at all why they should be 

45.38 45.98 A: trusted 

46.32 46.65 A: (( )) 

46.32 46.81 B: right 

47.02 49.09 A: many reasons why they should not be trusted 

49.39 50.21 B: exactly 

51.24 52.86 A: i believe they should be disarmed 

53.35 54.70 B: so do i i believe if we had 

55.50 59.64 B: done it sooner we wouldn't be having the pro- some of the problems that we have 

59.67 62.38 A: i i agree i i am sorry that 

62.75 69.40 A: the job wasn't done the first time we went in but i i understand why it wasn't done and i don't believe that president bush wants to 

69.51 72.04 A: to do it only because his father didn't 

72.64 73.81 A: finish the the job i 

73.65 74.17 B: right i 

74.38 77.51 B: i believe he's doing it for the best of the country 

76.81 77.40 A: i do too 

77.65 80.47 B: and not just our country but others as well 

80.03 80.53 A: right 

80.67 80.98 A: i 

81.41 81.95 A: agree 

82.50 86.40 A: oh hardly we ought to argue though shouldn't we are we supposed to argue 

84.23 91.30 B: no it was just more of a discussion on whether you agree or not i believe 

90.70 92.59 A: well that's what i think too uh 

92.86 94.57 A: this is my first time to participate 

94.40 97.71 B: mine too so 

94.90 95.43 A: and such 

96.05 99.91 A: oh so we really don't know what we're supposed to be doing do we 

98.29 101.17 B: no 

101.10 101.99 A: i suppose if we don't 

102.14 105.16 A: talk about what we're supposed to be talking about us they will notify us 

105.25 105.88 B: yeah 

107.46 111.14 A: anyway with all the terrorism that we've had and everything i hope that the superbowl 

111.30 112.46 A: goes well on sunday 

112.85 113.54 A: and uh 

113.94 114.90 A: (( trust that they're )) taking 

115.01 115.71 A: adequate 

116.27 118.84 A: precautions and from what i've read they seem to be 

119.15 119.65 B: yes 

119.86 120.77 A: for safety there 

121.21 121.55 A: uh 

122.34 122.67 A: i 

123.31 124.99 A: i don't see any 

125.17 126.81 A: any hope of trusting 

127.41 127.77 A: uh 

128.46 128.84 A: any 

129.16 131.34 A: iraqi or many of the middle eastern countries 

133.21 133.64 A: and 

134.28 135.27 A: i think we have to 

135.52 137.89 A: we will ne- our country will never be the same again 

138.13 140.04 B: ah right 

140.22 147.26 B: i i believe that um part of the problem is with the other countries that won't help us 

147.62 156.17 B: around them i i have a serious feeling that they have some interest in iraq not being disarmed 

156.40 158.22 A: that that may well be 

158.34 158.79 A: and 

158.93 169.16 A: i also get a little disgusted because if they won't help us we will continue to help them anytime they get into trouble and sometimes i think maybe we need to get a little more um 

170.54 174.07 A: i i believe the united states should continue to be a benevolent country 

174.17 174.67 A: but 

175.16 176.85 A: i don't believe we should be a doormat 

177.19 177.99 B: exactly 

177.25 177.62 A: and 

178.08 179.11 A: i think sometimes 

179.25 189.15 A: people don't help us we just turn around and oh that's okay honey we're help you anyway any time you need help well just let us know we'll come to your aid and i just think it's time to say hey 

187.12 187.52 B: mhm 

189.98 191.02 A: (( )) 

191.47 193.91 A: you're either with us or you're not there's no middle ground 

193.29 195.29 B: right 

197.15 203.83 B: we we haven't seen as much support as we did last time and it's basically the same thing 

197.59 197.86 A: when 

204.16 204.65 A: right 

205.14 205.72 A: exactly 

205.26 207.39 B: uh eh but it it's 

207.82 209.33 B: more urgent this time 

209.55 211.09 A: i think much more urgent this time 

209.70 219.76 B: i mean last time we went in to help a country this time it would be going to help more than one country 

219.39 219.89 A: yes 

220.35 220.88 A: i agree 

221.66 222.15 A: and i 

222.32 224.61 A: i don't i know the cost is going to be great 

225.13 225.45 A: and 

225.26 226.06 B: mhm 

225.96 227.92 A: i my husband fought in world war 

228.17 228.72 A: two 

229.23 232.33 A: and my brother fought in world war and 

232.99 237.80 A: those certainly were not pleasant times and i know they say the world is different now but 

238.15 240.51 A: in many times in many ways 

241.93 245.23 A: soldiers might have it a little easier than they did then because 

245.62 247.20 A: i remember when we went 

248.16 252.43 A: a long time without hearing from our brother i wasn't very old at the time but 

252.52 253.51 A: you know we went 

254.48 256.24 A: over a year without hearing from 

256.60 259.16 A: and he happened to be okay and got got home okay but they 

259.43 263.10 A: they couldn't get messages out from europe during world war two 

263.44 263.72 A: like 

264.03 267.04 A: today you know part of the problem i think is that we see 

268.13 268.90 A: the war 

269.49 272.09 A: played out before us everyday on television 

272.01 272.41 B: yeah 

272.90 275.38 A: and i'm not sure that's good i i think maybe 

275.98 276.40 A: um 

276.81 278.37 A: we know too much um 

279.00 282.68 A: i think some things could should be kept a little more secret than what they are 

282.97 283.55 B: mhm 

283.84 286.67 B: uh eh yeah because everybody can see it 

286.82 287.37 A: right 

287.13 287.90 B: and so and 

288.02 293.08 B: all of the things that they're on t._v. telling us what the government is doing 

293.18 297.98 B: the people in iraq and other can also see it 

296.71 303.60 A: sure they do and you know hey we're going to attack in two or three months if you don't settle down uh well let's just tell them when we're going in 

303.84 304.74 B: right 

304.94 308.11 B: i i believe that we are getting too much information 

308.19 309.16 A: yeah i think we're 

309.43 312.41 A: given much too much information i wish that uh 

312.67 313.39 A: you know when 

313.70 314.04 A: uh 

314.57 315.42 A: president reagan 

315.97 320.68 A: attacked (( )) that was done almost before anyone knew anything about it 

320.87 321.88 B: right 

321.89 328.21 A: and the element of surprise was there well i'm not sure that the element of surprise could ever be in any attack anymore 

326.19 330.06 B: no 

330.62 332.44 A: so and i i think we do need that 

330.86 331.54 B: i 

333.11 333.50 A: so 

333.82 337.56 B: yes there there there is definitely a need for some sort of 

337.67 343.87 B: element of surprise because as of right now you can sit there and watch the television and find out every 

344.12 355.79 B: um almost i mean i know we don't know everything that's going on and i realize that we do need to be informed somewhat of what our country is doing but we don't need to know everything 

350.52 351.27 A: yes 

354.16 354.63 A: that's right 

354.89 355.36 A: every 

355.73 356.63 A: small detail 

357.02 357.39 A: you know 

357.63 364.94 A: and the other countries mostly most e- most especially don't need to know it and there's no way to let the people in the united states know it without letting 

357.76 359.57 B: because if w- 

365.34 366.58 A: everyone else know it 

366.72 367.16 B: right 

368.35 368.72 A: and that 

369.16 372.89 A: i think that's just a major problem that we we have today the the 

373.30 374.07 A: media is 

374.79 375.30 A: is just 

375.89 376.45 A: uh 

376.95 379.03 A: blabbing everything that we might do 

379.17 380.55 A: sometime in the future and i 

381.56 381.85 A: i don't 

382.46 383.58 A: think that's necessary 

383.82 385.52 B: right 

388.16 388.62 A: i 

390.35 393.62 A: no are we supposed to know the cities and towns that the other one is in 

394.07 394.54 A: or not 

394.23 397.06 B: uh i'm not sure 

396.16 398.25 A: i'm not either well i'm in indiana i 

398.03 400.63 B: uh i'm in west virginia so 

398.49 398.81 A: (( )) 

399.54 403.78 A: okay well that's i was in (( your state )) this spring it was a beautiful state this fall winter 

404.19 404.89 B: ah 

404.80 405.69 A: state and uh 

406.21 407.83 A: so i i don't know 

408.07 408.54 A: exactly 

408.71 410.53 A: i don't see that it would hurt to know where 

410.65 412.39 A: the other one was coming from anyway 

411.92 413.11 B: hm no 

413.37 418.12 B: i think they're trying to get them different uh areas of the country so 

417.92 418.45 A: probably 

418.66 420.63 B: and try to get the feel of everybody 

420.68 421.22 A: right 

421.66 422.40 A: well uh 

422.94 429.59 A: they happened to get two that happen to agree pretty with each other so i'm sure they didn't plan it that what uh but uh 

428.38 430.12 B: uh no 

429.96 430.32 A: i 

430.99 433.75 A: i don't know though i have not talked with anyone 

433.93 436.68 A: in this locality who does not believe that we should 

437.21 437.91 A: go ahead and 

438.73 439.11 A: you know 

439.25 440.60 A: do whatever needs to be done 

449.31 458.62 B: the army and getting ready to be shipped over there i i don't you know i worry about what's going to happen but 

451.89 452.32 A: oh 

455.55 455.98 A: sure 

459.17 461.31 B: it was his choice to join the army 

461.48 461.84 A: right 

462.43 472.71 B: and his choice to defend our country in any way that he's needed so i support him in that and even if i didn't believe that we had a place 

466.29 466.59 A: right 

473.04 475.17 B: in iraq then 

475.68 479.47 B: i would still support him being there 

478.70 479.21 A: right 

479.44 480.42 A: right well 

480.53 480.88 A: um 

481.14 481.54 A: i 

481.95 484.78 A: it is true that we do have an all volunteer army now 

485.30 485.68 A: um 

486.60 488.39 A: i don't know if that will continue 

488.80 489.58 A: to be true 

490.08 490.94 A: if not i have 

491.39 493.41 A: a one son that would be young enough 

493.75 494.83 A: and a grandson 

495.57 496.83 A: i don't know my son 

496.93 498.52 A: is my youngest son is 

499.15 499.52 A: uh 

499.64 504.39 A: thirty-two i guess that would probably be young enough that he could be drafted i'm not sure 

500.28 501.63 B: mhm 

505.01 509.14 B: i'm not sure what when it would be what the cut off date is 

508.88 511.35 A: but anyway you know he has a young child and 

511.51 513.20 A: yes i would hate to see him go 

514.29 514.60 A: but 

514.94 515.27 A: some 

515.55 515.96 A: i guess 

516.76 518.48 A: sometimes we have to go beyond our 

519.45 520.13 A: personal 

522.61 523.80 A: uh comfort zone 

524.13 525.08 A: to do what's best 

525.30 525.95 A: for the coun- 

526.13 528.93 A: country and i i do appreciate all the men 

529.19 530.46 A: that have given so much 

530.67 531.26 B: mhm 

530.94 532.35 A: for our freedom and it 

532.89 533.23 A: you know 

533.35 534.55 A: freedom is never free 

534.82 535.75 B: mhm 

535.00 537.54 A: and it never it never has been and it never will be 

537.73 541.50 B: right and we need to everything we can to protect our freedoms 

541.27 543.55 A: that's right if they are being taken away from us 

543.61 552.20 B: and if if we show that we're weak and okay you don't want to do this so you don't have to whether it's a bad or thing or not then 

543.80 544.43 A: that's (( tough )) 

560.79 561.44 A: yes 

566.00 568.73 B: are willing to retaliate and do anything 

569.06 572.14 B: anything needed to 

571.20 571.46 A: right 

572.37 573.56 B: protect ourselves 

573.77 575.15 A: whatever it is whatever 

574.95 575.67 B: mhm 

575.70 576.59 A: i i agree 

577.15 578.85 A: one hundred percent that we need to 

580.01 580.60 A: you know have 

580.75 584.51 A: to be protected and to protect our if we don't protect ourselves 

585.11 586.38 A: and we don't stand up 

587.63 589.21 A: for what we believe in 

589.55 590.63 A: we'll fall for anything 

590.99 591.58 B: mhm 

591.33 591.97 A: and uh 

593.58 594.48 A: it cannot be 

596.38 598.84 A: freedom has cost too much through the ages 

599.26 599.67 A: to
