62.00 63.29 B: that's one thing that i have i 

63.63 66.12 B: i'm not to bad about caffeine i drink 

67.02 69.35 B: mostly tea which isn't to bad and 

69.49 72.93 B: right now i'm drinking diet coke which has plenty of caffeine in it and i can tell 

73.60 74.04 B: um 

75.88 76.51 A: like water 

76.79 82.48 B: yeah i kn- well it tastes good i i at least try to be good and have diet coke so at least try to be good and have diet coke so at least i'm not having all the empty calories 

83.30 89.10 B: but um i do like my coffee from time to time but i don't drink it at home because my husband doesn't like the smell 

90.05 90.88 B: and so i 

91.26 92.62 B: try not to have it at home 

93.27 93.97 B: but um 

94.31 96.43 B: other habits that i'm working on it's 

96.78 97.98 B: i eat to much 

98.24 100.74 B: and i eat just because i like to have my mouth full 

101.13 101.99 A: yeah i- 

101.73 102.33 B: you know 

102.55 103.62 A: it relieves boredom 

103.89 105.78 B: and it- it's a funny thing because 

106.31 109.42 B: even if i'm not very hungry i feel as though i have to have something in my mouth 

109.59 111.18 A: right i- i'm the same way 

111.45 112.18 B: and so 

112.49 113.83 B: i try to at least keep low 

114.09 116.20 B: you know low fat crunchy things around 

116.32 118.24 B: but i'm trying to lose weight because i'm a little 

118.85 123.44 B: overweight and i've been i finally signed up for an aerobics class so i'm getting some exercise 

124.26 126.86 B: and a the only problem with that is that my knee 

127.60 129.42 B: cannot take all that bouncing up and down 

129.56 130.34 A: yeah thats hard 

130.61 131.01 B: yeah 

131.55 132.21 A: yeah i'm 

132.36 133.16 A: trying to lose weight 

133.26 135.63 A: too i have a sixteen month old son and 

135.77 136.39 B: oh my 

136.43 138.72 A: i have yet to lose the weight so 

138.71 142.36 B: yeah i i have a son whose six years old and a 

143.56 146.88 B: i was much more active before i had him then after 

147.41 147.96 A: same here 

147.98 150.30 B: and uh he's very demanding of my time 

150.71 153.31 B: (( )) now at six he can do more himself but he still 

153.61 159.83 B: he's he's a total extrovert he loves to have company even when he's just sitting and watching the t._v. and so he expects me to sit there too 

159.94 162.11 B: fact it's to the point where i think we- maybe i should get a 

162.86 166.22 B: you know a treadmill or something like that course then he would complain about the noise 

167.03 168.29 A: well most treadmills are 

168.68 169.52 A: pretty quiet 

169.91 171.44 A: or one of those ski machines 

171.67 173.30 B: have you tried those before do you like those 

173.33 174.33 A: the ski machines 

174.24 174.71 B: yeah 

175.00 175.81 A: there not to bad 

178.61 182.86 B: well that's what i'm thinking with the treadmill to i'd almost have to do it in the room with the t._v. just because 

182.51 183.00 A: right 

183.49 188.02 B: at least then you've got something to watch i don't i don't know that you can really read while you're doing one of those things 

189.30 191.41 A: that would be kind of hard cause you're kind of bouncing 

192.29 192.73 B: yeah 

195.08 195.50 B: yeah 

197.13 198.08 A: your eyes are moving 

198.06 200.88 B: i guess people do it when they're on on you know those bicycles 

201.60 202.91 A: yeah that would be easy to do 

203.20 205.57 B: yeah that's true cause then you've got something to prop it on 

205.71 206.23 A: right 

206.91 207.97 B: so anyway just 

207.67 208.48 A: i wish i could 

208.89 210.87 A: have the will power to do that 

209.58 212.78 B: i know that's really tough 

212.80 214.33 A: that's my hardest problem is 

214.59 215.17 A: you know i 

216.19 217.49 A: i have good intentions 

217.67 218.05 A: but 

218.37 219.93 A: it never pans out 

219.95 220.53 B: yeah 

220.71 222.31 A: its hard to remem- you know to 

222.65 224.20 A: think about oh i need to exercise 

224.89 227.90 B: yeah when when i just had evan we lived in a 

228.34 234.38 B: in new york city in manhattan and so we couldn't stay in the apartment so i actually got out a fair bit and did some walking 

234.80 235.95 B: which was pretty nice 

236.32 239.19 B: and a there's a lot of palaces you could walk around new york city 

239.63 243.90 B: but know know that i'm back at work my desk job i sit at the desk all day 

245.13 248.02 B: you know i sit in front of the computer a lot of the time and a 

248.44 251.94 B: don't really get up and do much exercise i probably ought to get up and just walk around 

253.17 255.94 A: just walk up and down the stairs or something 

255.98 259.90 B: yeah just something to get going so at least i do my aerobics that's the only thing 

260.38 263.79 B: and i was doing really well i lost a few pounds up until christmas and then 

264.20 265.96 B: over christmas as you can imagine 

265.79 268.83 A: oh yeah all the good food and cookies and 

266.40 268.69 B: all the good food and 

268.99 269.94 B: changes habits 

269.13 271.18 A: cookies and candies and everything 

271.12 273.19 B: i know ah that stuff's so bad for you 

274.41 275.03 A: hard to 

277.17 284.10 B: yeah i you know i don't i haven't really heard from very many people that have a real good solution on how to improve that as a habit either 

287.54 287.96 B: yeah 

290.85 291.44 B: is that right 

293.23 293.70 B: right 

294.49 297.83 B: and so you- you're probably at home too with your child 

297.81 299.13 A: well yeah i work evenings 

299.43 299.99 B: okay 

300.64 302.20 B: so you trade off with child care then 

302.47 304.09 A: well actually i live with my mom 

304.39 306.17 B: oh that's nice so then she could help 

305.78 306.23 A: she wor- 

306.41 308.08 A: my mom works six to two 

308.59 320.50 A: and then i work like five in the evening to one in the morning so she's home to take care of him while i'm at work yeah so that makes things a little easier and i don't have to pay for day-care that way 

314.37 315.28 B: well thats kind of nice 

315.50 315.89 B: uh huh 

320.30 320.89 B: yeah 

321.26 324.56 B: well i mean it- its especially tough i think to overcome 

325.21 330.07 B: habits that aren't so good if you're if you're at home cause if i'm at home i'll eat twice as much just cause i'm there 

330.21 330.70 A: yeah 

330.92 332.22 B: you know so that's that's the pr- 

333.41 336.12 B: and i i could imagine to that i- i mean if you're at home 

336.69 341.00 B: th- the smoke since there's already smoke there yo- you don't mind the smoke smell or things like that 

341.01 344.07 A: right 

341.50 342.49 B: where as if 

342.67 347.18 B: if you go out and you're at work or something i i don't know if your rules are strict i know here they are 

347.53 350.08 B: really strict about where you can smoke and where you can't 

350.30 352.07 A: yeah we ha- i have to 

352.21 353.31 A: go outside to smoke 

353.71 354.38 B: is that right 

356.36 357.37 B: oh my where are you from 

357.71 358.84 A: oh i'm in ohio 

358.93 361.07 B: ohio okay yeah i grew up in the midwest too 

365.41 366.04 B: yeah 

367.55 368.03 B: yeah 

368.31 369.42 B: have you thought about quitting 

370.58 371.55 A: i've thought about it 

372.18 377.70 A: but it's really hard i- i've tried to cut down and 

373.92 374.41 B: yeah 

376.76 378.54 B: do you do you not smoke around your child 

379.52 380.49 A: um i do 

381.42 382.94 A: but i try to you know 

383.33 384.24 A: not as much 

384.21 384.55 B: sure 

385.16 387.45 B: yeah my i my mother in law actually 

387.56 391.66 B: stopped smoking in the room with him although you can still smell it when we when we 

391.10 391.65 A: right 

392.02 392.71 B: go to there house 

393.06 393.42 B: you know it 

393.66 394.72 B: it's always right there 

395.31 395.98 B: but um 

396.17 399.32 B: she's been really good about not smoking right in front of him 

399.56 400.72 B: that works out really well 

402.70 403.41 B: so anyway 

403.63 405.48 B: as far as which one is the worst 

407.16 409.09 B: i guess it it just really depends i mean 

410.45 412.41 B: anything can be bad for your health if it's done 

412.56 414.50 B: if it's overdone that would be caffeine 

414.83 415.91 B: or alcohol 

416.29 419.12 B: or overeating or anything else i don- see i don't drink a lot i drink 

419.24 420.11 B: once in awhile 

420.22 421.01 A: yeah i i 

421.21 422.19 A: rarely drink 

425.78 428.44 B: you know and the funny thing is that i just read something in the paper that 

428.83 431.98 B: that moderate drinking is actually supposed to be healthful for you 

432.89 433.57 B: but um 

434.67 444.06 B: i i went to grad school in wisconsin and learned to drink beer there and and so i like to drink beer once in awhile but that's not something i do very often for one thing it makes me very tired 

444.55 446.18 A: same here 

445.08 451.89 B: and and so well of course if you work in the evenings that would be even worse cause that would be in the time most people would think of doing it 

449.10 449.56 A: right 

452.19 452.55 A: true 

453.17 454.77 A: but you know i i knew someone that 

454.90 455.69 A: had um 

456.10 456.97 A: bladder problem 

457.58 458.55 A: and the doctor per- 

458.66 459.23 A: -scribed 

459.93 460.37 B: really 

461.27 462.61 B: oh my 

462.44 463.37 A: cause i- it helped 

465.52 467.19 B: i suppose i never thought of that 

467.54 469.05 B: that's a that's a very unique 

469.60 472.51 B: unique kind of diagnosis or unique prescription 

473.67 476.20 A: drink it every so often 

474.11 474.87 B: did it work 

475.57 476.10 B: did it work 

477.08 477.77 B: oh that's good 

479.78 480.25 B: so 

480.87 483.31 B: i mean cert- certainly for me th- the worst one is 

483.58 486.18 B: is overeating and the eating without thinking 

487.67 488.03 B: so 

488.41 489.37 B: it's hard to know 

491.60 492.97 B: what to do about that 

493.82 496.49 B: and when i catch myself you know i kind of slap myself 

496.86 499.26 B: on the wrist and say you shouldn't be doing that 

500.13 500.59 B: and 

501.05 504.74 B: and maybe it'll stop me a little bit but boy as soon as i see the food then 

505.27 506.61 A: well maybe getting you know 

506.94 510.32 A: more healthy snacks like apples and carrots and celery 

511.76 513.88 B: ke- keeping the junk-food out is 

514.21 516.12 B: i- you know i got all this chris- this 

516.28 518.13 B: this candy for christmas like chocolates 

518.71 522.73 B: and so ha- half of me is inclined to just eat it know to get it out of the way 

522.54 523.23 A: yeah 

523.24 526.62 B: course that's kind of a well that's kind of a short sighted approach 

527.06 528.72 B: my son helps me eat it to he 

528.82 530.37 B: more than happy to do that and 

530.12 531.55 A: oh i'm sure 

530.83 532.08 B: doesn't bother him a bit 

532.19 534.22 B: gives him more more energy 

532.23 533.62 A: oh (( )) 

534.80 537.93 A: just don't give it to him at you know eight nine o'clock at night 

537.82 538.71 B: yeah that's true 

539.48 540.22 A: (( )) 

540.69 541.99 A: for a couple hours 

542.30 544.54 B: well one of the things that surprised me about him was that 

544.86 547.20 B: he needs no more sleep than i do 

547.58 548.18 B: and so 

548.89 550.11 B: he he is up til 

550.59 552.77 B: nine thirty or ten o'clock even on school night 

553.18 553.68 A: wow 

553.58 556.42 B: and he he survives all right that way he's doing great in school 

556.41 557.13 A: well that's good 

557.15 560.82 B: and so bit were probably teaching him really bad habits by letting him do that 

559.32 561.42 A: he is staying up yeah 

561.65 563.36 B: (( )) it's so it's so hard 

563.95 565.27 B: to maintain that discipline 

565.70 566.18 A: right 

572.76 573.43 B: i suppose 

579.15 579.78 B: wow 

579.54 582.12 A: in that time i only have like three or four cigarettes 

582.50 583.01 B: sure 

582.75 583.02 A: b- 

583.24 587.44 A: because you know having to go outside you know i don't want to stand out in the cold 

586.51 590.22 B: well right plus it's you have to be able to take a break from whatever you're doing to 

589.95 592.57 A: right well i work in a convenient store so you know 

593.19 593.86 A: breaks is 

594.37 595.76 A: breaks are in between customers 

596.33 596.70 B: uh huh
