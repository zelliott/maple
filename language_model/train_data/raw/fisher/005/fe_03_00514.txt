5.08 8.19 B: hi my name is sativa and i don't agree 

9.90 10.77 A: well that works 

14.11 14.94 B: um 

16.92 18.23 B: i don't know do you want to start 

18.94 19.60 A: a pardon 

19.90 20.97 B: do you want to start 

21.97 22.61 A: yeah that's fine 

23.38 23.94 A: um 

26.24 27.61 A: have you been sick so far this year 

27.89 29.18 B: i have been yes 

29.60 29.99 A: oh 

29.81 33.50 B: and it definitely took longer than a week to get over it 

33.87 34.91 A: oh yeah a lot longer 

35.17 37.64 A: i having i'm sick now had it for about two weeks 

35.19 36.01 B: yeah 

37.77 39.50 B: ah yeah 

39.69 42.34 B: mine lasted for a couple of months actually 

42.41 42.78 A: oh 

42.91 44.39 A: hope mine don't get that bad but 

44.43 45.50 B: hm no 

45.75 46.68 A: oh you never know 

47.14 48.12 B: that's true 

49.36 52.93 B: ah i think it depends a lot on the weather too like if you're going 

53.19 59.27 B: stay sick for longer its definitely cold outside and you probably going to stay sick for a lot longer than if it's not as cold outside 

59.84 60.90 A: hm some people 

61.08 62.70 A: i tend to get sick during the summer 

63.03 63.91 B: oh wow 

63.60 66.18 A: ah yeah i rarely get sick during the winter this is 

66.37 67.27 A: one time it got me 

67.89 70.72 B: oh the only time i ever get sick is during the winter time 

72.46 73.60 A: i wouldn't like that too good 

73.94 76.50 B: no not at all especially when it's snowing outside 

76.32 77.90 A: i mean a cold just makes it worse 

77.33 79.43 B: exactly 

81.51 86.25 B: um but usually don't go to the doctor for it's usually something i just take of on my own 

87.44 90.81 A: yeah that's me too unless it gets really really bad i don't bother 

88.61 89.22 B: yeah 

91.03 93.43 B: exactly like it's almost 

92.20 92.98 A: but usually though 

93.57 93.98 A: when you 

93.61 94.94 B: not much they can do 

95.03 99.80 A: yeah when you do get where you want to go the doctor and you actually go you tend to get better the next day 

99.97 101.23 B: yeah exactly 

100.29 103.29 A: like i shouldn't of went i wasted all the money for nothing 

103.56 104.80 B: exactly 

105.18 110.70 A: like if you don't go it will hang on and hang on and hang on waiting two months down the road wishing you would have went a month ago 

111.10 112.60 B: that's true 

114.47 116.94 B: i feel like there's not much they can do so 

117.41 119.21 A: no not too totally much just pretty much 

119.34 121.93 A: standard they just say you go home and take it easy 

122.60 123.94 A: rest take fluids 

124.40 125.75 B: yep exactly 

125.06 125.49 A: which is 

125.59 127.05 A: what you would have done to begin with 

127.48 128.26 B: right 

128.71 131.35 A: if it makes you feel better to spend a little money to get a second opinion 

133.06 134.22 B: true 

133.77 135.01 A: it shouldn't though i guess 

135.33 140.11 B: yeah because they they tell so that the exact same thing that you already know and already been doing 

141.23 144.03 A: yeah but psychology though if you don't do it you feel stupid 

145.40 148.96 A: convince yourself thought well maybe i do have the flu well maybe this or maybe that 

149.98 150.56 B: yeah 

151.56 152.70 A: better safe than sorry 

152.88 153.74 B: that's true 

155.05 158.29 A: worked with a friend quit a few times they didn't have the money to go so you just had to tough it out 

159.16 159.76 B: yeah 

160.51 162.50 B: well i know i hadn't been sick in 

162.66 165.87 B: in years until i moved up north and then 

166.25 174.56 B: every year that i've been here since then i've gotten sick so i like my opinion is is that it's completely related to weather for me at least 

175.31 178.88 A: it could be i lived up north for awhile and that seemed like what it was with me 

179.29 179.93 B: yeah 

180.18 181.51 A: i get sick now once ever 

181.86 183.25 A: i don't know three or four years 

183.52 184.48 B: oh wow 

184.39 187.11 A: yeah but it seems like when i do get it it hangs on and on 

187.31 188.61 B: exactly 

188.49 190.97 A: yeah it makes up for the time i didn't get it before 

190.37 191.42 B: yeah 

191.60 192.77 A: they (( )) 

191.77 192.95 B: that's true 

194.42 194.98 B: yeah 

196.14 198.97 A: so you're up north it must be really cold up there in in the north (( )) 

199.48 201.85 B: it's freezing yeah 

202.63 203.67 A: well we've had a break here 

204.16 204.72 A: (( )) twenty 

204.32 205.82 B: where are you from 

206.13 208.31 A: ah north carolina we're in between storms here 

208.61 211.19 B: ah (( )) i'm in connecticut 

211.41 212.01 A: i don't know 

211.97 213.75 B: really cool 

213.03 213.38 A: yeah 

214.19 215.00 A: well i bet 

215.27 216.28 B: yeah 

215.69 216.37 A: single digits 

217.24 217.95 B: yeah 

218.02 219.42 A: wouldn't want to be in your shoes right now 

220.82 223.39 B: i'd love to be in the south right now 

224.33 226.45 A: well the way it is down here right now we had a storm the 

226.60 226.93 A: past 

227.65 228.03 A: ah 

228.42 229.88 A: four days ago it left four inches 

230.43 231.63 A: two days later it was gone 

232.12 232.88 B: oh wow 

232.34 235.40 A: yesterday there was nothing left and tomorrow it's supposed to hit again 

235.64 235.91 A: so 

236.82 237.46 B: wow 

237.41 240.69 A: yeah with it coming like this and going and coming going everybody's going to be 

241.68 243.13 B: that's definitely true 

243.03 244.62 A: we won't have a chance to (( )) 

245.25 248.69 B: because once you get better it's going to like hit again and you're going to get cold again yeah 

247.33 247.77 A: yeah 

249.54 253.57 A: and today it was so warm people were running around outside without jackets and barefoot and 

254.14 255.33 A: it's it's wild weather 

255.64 259.31 B: now you can't you definitely can't do that that's just asking to be sick 

257.04 257.62 A: no 

259.94 261.79 A: first off me running around giving it to everybody 

262.41 264.00 A: anybody that doesn't have it will have it 

264.41 265.27 B: that's true 

266.34 267.00 B: yeah 

267.15 270.50 A: but everybody on there will arrange (( )) so they should (( )) 

270.94 272.13 B: same thing here 

273.01 277.89 B: except for people tend like people are getting sick and they're getting better but then they definitely get sick again 

278.24 278.82 B: and 

279.11 279.74 B: i don't know 

280.56 282.20 A: they all seem to do that they go around in circles 

282.73 283.33 B: yeah 

283.15 283.97 A: they think (( )) 

284.12 287.67 A: sure that they're over it and the very next day they're just as sick as they were a week ago 

288.12 288.62 B: yeah 

289.80 290.66 A: hope that's not me 

291.01 294.10 A: my sickness has kind of gotten down to a certain level and it's just staying there 

294.34 295.13 B: yeah 

295.12 296.33 A: just enough to make you feel bad 

296.90 299.38 B: sure i'm i'm pretty much over mine now 

299.89 300.57 A: oh i wish 

300.57 300.99 B: but 

301.45 301.90 B: yeah 

303.25 304.55 A: mine kind of comes and goes 

304.64 305.03 A: failed 

305.82 309.79 A: i either wake up feeling this is going to be a good day and it gets worse towards the night or 

310.42 314.81 A: wake up in the morning all stuffy and sneezy and feeling bad get feeling better as the day goes on 

315.19 315.74 B: yeah 

316.01 316.80 A: either way though 

318.88 319.39 A: bottom line 

320.95 322.19 A: you don't feel bad regardless 

322.50 323.96 B: that's true 

326.05 328.41 A: (( )) 

328.88 329.46 B: yeah 

329.64 331.44 B: i don't think there is ever going to be one 

331.54 335.17 A: on and if they did it would take a lot of money out of a lot of different companies pockets 

335.55 336.35 B: yeah 

336.93 339.30 A: it probably wouldn't be real smart for american general if he did 

339.66 340.77 B: no not at all 

341.62 345.27 A: i mean if they cure one disease like that (( )) 

345.83 347.13 A: that comes back every year 

347.95 348.31 A: and that 

348.72 350.99 A: that filters down to where it hurts everybody in the long run 

349.05 349.68 B: (( )) 

351.54 352.44 B: exactly 

352.42 353.93 A: even though it would help a lot to both if they did 

355.15 356.79 B: yeah but 

356.07 357.78 A: which ever way it goes it's still bad 

358.18 363.76 B: that true it would be good for american population but bad for like people in the medical field 

364.81 365.17 B: so 

367.23 368.83 A: can't afford to loose anymore (( )) 

369.17 370.37 B: that's true 

371.35 373.54 A: but it would sure be enough (( )) for a few diseases to be cured though 

373.87 374.64 B: yeah 

375.47 377.32 A: even it was something as simple as a cold 

378.17 378.58 B: yeah 

379.24 382.52 B: yeah maybe one day but i don't i i don't see it happening anytime soon 

382.67 383.45 A: i don't neither 

383.89 384.20 B: yeah 

384.49 387.00 A: i believe politics plays a lot in (( )) and it will never happen 

387.59 388.90 B: that's very true 

390.53 392.12 A: it would be doubtful (( )) 

392.60 394.12 A: actually cure a major disease 

394.63 395.11 B: yeah 

396.80 397.23 A: money 

397.59 399.52 A: how to tend to it with stocks and all a that 

399.74 400.52 B: yeah 

402.59 404.10 A: and that's that's (( )) 

404.56 405.39 A: that's the way i think 

405.81 406.35 B: mhm 

406.79 407.69 B: i agree 

408.97 410.31 A: to bad the government didn't give them 

411.37 415.37 A: i don't know sometime of standard to reimburse them for the money they would loose if they found the cure 

415.86 418.72 A: you know from the sale of the drugs the drugs and medication 

419.00 419.76 B: right 

419.81 421.99 A: then they might be more forthcoming if they come up with it 

422.43 423.86 A: cure or something to alleviate 

425.44 425.90 B: hm 

427.66 430.74 A: but then again i'll guess the government might go bankrupt then (( )) 

431.07 431.98 A: worse then it is now 

432.58 434.52 B: right and that would cause even more problems 

434.75 436.32 A: yeah see either way you go you can't win 

436.56 437.30 B: yeah 

437.51 439.37 A: (( )) even worse 

440.10 440.44 B: yeah 

441.83 442.33 B: yep 

445.18 447.76 B: exactly that's what it comes down to 

448.17 448.94 A: i like that idea 

450.99 456.42 B: getting sick and saying why don't you go to the doctor and trying to get it 

451.58 452.13 A: what up baby 

458.21 460.92 A: yeah but like we said (( )) it's stuff we already know 

461.32 462.22 B: exactly 

463.49 465.41 A: (( )) go through out the big circle you can't win 

466.34 466.83 B: yeah 

466.87 468.58 A: (( )) 

468.79 470.46 B: not at all 

470.94 472.07 A: and i've had quit a few years 

472.30 474.35 A: use for stuff so i guess i could take few more 

474.62 475.43 B: yeah 

476.19 476.78 B: get 

476.92 481.23 B: get a (( )) eventually maybe then people will start eventually moving (( )) or end up getting sick 

481.37 482.01 A: (( )) 

483.40 484.92 A: we were talking the other day it's like maybe it's 

485.80 487.31 A: what would happen if one year 

487.48 490.53 A: if they could figure out some way just to let everybody get sick at once 

490.84 492.73 B: (( )) 

491.38 494.86 A: i wrote there there would be no spreading it around everyone would done and be done with it 

495.18 495.83 B: yeah 

496.52 497.79 A: and you could pick your day (( )) 

498.15 499.57 A: (( )) 

499.86 500.22 A: the 

500.50 501.60 A: september twentieth 

501.84 502.32 A: sick 

502.59 504.55 A: be prepared cancel christmas 

506.02 509.14 A: win the lottery send it out on july tenth i don't care just get it over with 

509.27 511.70 B: right close down all the stores like 

509.93 510.24 A: i'd 

511.13 511.58 A: yeah 

511.82 513.09 B: close everything 

512.89 515.65 A: i would rather know it was coming then have to worry about when it was going to get me 

515.99 517.66 B: cause then you're 

516.59 519.45 A: or being around someone that's sick and wondering damn it am i going to be sick tomorrow 

519.71 520.71 B: exactly 

521.68 522.48 A: well that would be nice 

523.17 525.39 A: it wouldn't you know mean nice but it would be nice 

526.10 527.73 B: yeah i understand 

529.44 531.39 A: people think crazy things sometimes when they're sick though 

531.84 532.38 B: yeah 

532.84 535.85 A: (( )) the person that gave it to me gave it to a hundred other and kept 

535.87 536.82 B: that's true 

536.02 536.93 A: spreading and spreading 

537.34 541.54 B: see i was always the type of person who would give it to everybody else but i would never get it from anybody else 

541.81 542.13 A: yeah 

542.99 543.74 B: i don't know 

543.88 545.17 B: how that works but 

546.38 548.33 A: well i think everything kind of mutates 

549.02 552.83 A: the more it gets around so the coming years up it's probably some new disease that you can get again 

553.17 553.72 B: yeah 

554.32 555.41 A: well that's the bad part of it 

561.21 562.37 A: but it don't work that way 

562.77 564.16 B: that's true yeah 

563.42 564.77 A: it would be nice though wouldn't it 

565.10 566.16 B: it would be great 

567.80 568.97 A: but could you imagine though 

570.39 572.61 A: show interrupted you just roll to the thing ah 

573.14 575.23 A: flu day it's now been announced 

576.90 578.71 A: that'd be crazy but i'd like it 

578.93 579.83 B: yeah 

579.74 583.23 A: i wouldn't mind putting christmas off for a couple of days just to get it over with 

583.45 584.98 B: that's true 

586.24 588.17 A: ah i bet that wouldn't go over with a lot of people though wouldn't it 

588.36 590.32 B: no not at all 

589.59 593.17 A: well the ones that are so sure they won't get it will be the ones 

593.45 594.16 A: to have a cow 

594.46 595.17 B: yeah 

595.27 598.73 B: and they they'd be the one to have the worst during that one day as well 

598.72 599.27 A: why yeah
