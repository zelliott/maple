75.87 80.29 B: for over a month and everybody else in our area also did 

80.01 80.96 A: mm 

80.33 83.82 B: when they got this was in november and december 

83.48 88.69 A: yeah could be weather related too you know because it's colder back there and 

88.09 89.64 B: right damper 

89.33 92.14 A: m- yeah we have the rain out here so 

91.88 93.42 B: yeah um 

93.82 97.34 A: [lipsmack] [noise] so are you a are you a college student or 

96.76 97.85 B: oh no no 

97.66 100.86 A: you're just a participant well see so am i 

98.74 99.71 B: yes 

100.77 101.78 B: yeah 

101.13 109.48 A: and i've never been linked to a participant before this is the first time usually they link me to a s- a researcher that asks me the questions 

104.83 106.19 B: oh okay 

109.10 110.09 B: okay 

110.00 112.89 A: but obviously it took did it take your p._i._n. number 

113.06 114.01 B: yes 

113.50 118.25 A: well it took mine too so they must be recording so we're okay i guess [laughter] 

117.26 119.25 B: okay um 

119.65 121.63 B: [mn] i just noticed um 

121.80 130.58 B: i belong to a health club and just about everybody at the health club stays healthy during the winter if they work out at least twice a week 

128.96 130.28 A: mhm 

130.63 131.63 A: yeah 

131.16 133.66 B: compared to people who don't work out [mn] 

133.11 138.24 A: right i think that makes sense too build your immune system and 

137.64 138.59 B: yeah 

138.41 139.21 A: um 

139.36 141.00 B: and extra juice 

140.68 141.71 A: right 

141.50 143.48 B: and such but um 

143.62 146.61 B: the vitamin c. and then as soon as i get a cold 

146.70 147.82 B: um 

148.03 151.00 B: i'll take the coldeze tablets 

150.82 151.68 A: mm 

151.47 152.89 B: and they seem to help 

152.53 160.93 A: right it may help boost the immune system a little bit [sigh] what was that last question they asked [laughter] i can't remember 

154.77 155.75 B: mhm 

162.80 166.47 B: [sigh] [sigh] about how often we've gotten sick is one and then 

166.19 168.04 A: (( well maybe yeah maybe that was )) 

167.46 173.88 B: um i- if you go to the doctor you have it a week and you still the cold is seven days 

170.73 172.56 A: it that's right the seven 

174.06 175.16 B: um 

174.07 174.97 A: right 

175.19 177.46 B: yeah no matter uh 

177.70 182.83 B: i don't think you can take anything um the doctor would give you that will get rid of the uh 

182.84 185.15 B: cold anyway antibiotics won't work 

184.76 193.81 A: right so you're just wasting your time because it's viral and yeah and generally i end up getting sick when i do visit a doctor's office or a hospital 

185.44 186.51 B: no doubt 

188.21 189.21 B: right 

193.98 196.64 A: (( simply because there are so many germs [lipsmack] )) 

193.98 194.95 B: mhm 

196.04 197.32 B: right 

196.85 201.27 A: and that generally i try to avoid that period [laughter] 

200.27 202.92 B: right i'll take uh another thing that i've done 

202.97 206.97 B: um [lipsmack] is i keep uh baby wipes in the car 

206.83 209.11 A: mm that's a great idea 

207.64 215.54 B: and i have for about fifteen years and my husband does too so if we're out shopping as soon as we'll get in the car we use baby wipes 

212.31 213.01 A: (( mm )) 

215.08 227.02 A: yeah you know goldie hawn uses rubber gloves to pump her gas she keeps a container of rubber gloves in her car [laughter] and doesn't touch anything that's publically used unless she has rubber gloves on 

219.56 220.34 B: oh 

222.28 223.82 B: oh wow 

226.88 227.67 B: oh 

227.58 228.66 A: isn't that funny 

228.48 229.79 B: yeah 

229.15 232.80 A: [laughter] but yeah that's great 

230.77 231.72 B: (( oh but )) 

231.79 239.54 B: [mn] the baby wipes have just been e- excellent and my husband's a referee for basketball and he referees seven days a week 

239.69 247.20 B: and as soon as he gets in the car he uses the um baby wipes because the ball players are sick and then they're handling the basketball 

246.94 250.30 A: mhm that's yeah that's great a great idea 

247.65 248.40 B: yeah 

250.25 253.72 B: so that has really been um a plus too 

253.45 254.95 A: (( mhm [sigh] )) 

254.89 255.87 B: (( um )) 

254.96 267.26 A: well i'm healthy now so hopefully i make it through the rest of the winter without any i haven't had i haven't gotten sick sick in a long long time i think i've had bronchitis once maybe in the last fifteen years 

258.89 259.74 B: (( yeah )) 

266.87 267.75 B: uh-huh 

267.63 271.27 A: and in generally i stay pretty healthy through the winter 

271.14 274.63 B: yeah i do too if i yeah i usually do get to the um 

271.73 272.99 A: (( um [sigh] )) 

274.89 283.65 B: the health club and work out at least a couple of days a week but we were on vacation and i came back and i had a sinus infection and it was very hard to get rid of 

281.20 281.99 A: mm 

283.12 293.56 A: yeah and i think stress has a lot to do with it too if you're stressed you're gonna you're immune system's down and you're more susceptible to getting sick you know like if somebody's ill in your family and you're having to deal with it 

293.48 294.63 B: right 

293.97 305.31 A: and going to the hospital or doctor's office all the time you're gonna end up probably getting sick too because you know it's like i said i normally always get sick whenever i go to urgency care with someone because 

299.19 300.32 B: right 

304.91 305.84 B: yeah 

305.49 309.72 A: somebody in there's got a virus and i then end up breathing spores or something 

309.73 315.01 B: well and and i notice too when you go to the doctor's office they're always washing their hands before they 

315.19 316.29 B: see you 

315.41 316.36 A: mhm 

316.74 318.22 A: yeah 

317.11 318.87 B: too from room to room 

319.07 320.17 B: they um 

319.20 320.04 A: right 

320.52 324.21 B: at least that's what i've noticed there before they even um 

324.11 325.94 A: good point yeah 

325.46 331.52 B: touch you but there's just germs on every handle that you're touching when you're going out shopping or 

330.49 338.70 A: and yeah and money too that's the other thing some people uh just have like a phobia of even touching things that somebody else touched like a pen or 

332.90 333.70 B: yeah 

336.09 337.15 B: mhm 

339.00 340.06 A: (( you know )) 

339.73 340.94 B: yeah 

340.26 348.58 A: um shopping cart [laughter] i don't there's a lot if you got to thinking about it there's a lot of things that that general population uses 

347.67 350.95 B: right and then another thing if you're out um [lipsmack] 

351.08 358.13 B: don't touch your nose or your eyes or your mouth because that's the best way to pick up the virus 

357.51 363.51 A: yeah yeah [sigh] well i think we covered a lot of points on this topic is there anything 

359.51 360.72 B: but that's right 

362.17 365.19 B: yes i don't know do they tell you when to end or what [mn] 

364.52 367.47 A: uh no we end it so it's just uh when 

367.63 374.67 A: unless there's anything else you need to add to it usually it doesn't go for more than five minutes so i think we've been on for almost seven so we're okay 

367.74 368.74 B: oh 

372.14 373.06 B: oh 

373.88 376.75 B: oh wow okay well we're freezing here 

375.27 375.98 A: um 

376.77 379.03 A: okay [laughter] 

377.37 379.51 B: it's below zero so 

379.48 380.61 A: oh well 

379.66 381.98 B: we're uh getting tired of it 

380.64 384.70 A: stoke the fire and [lipsmack] grab some hot chocolate and stay warm 

383.45 388.76 B: yep yeah [laughter] cuddle up [laughter] okay thank you 

384.77 389.77 A: [laughter] [laughter] all right well it was nice talking with you
