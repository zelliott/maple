0.81 2.45 A: my name is mike 

2.12 4.78 B: my name is amant 

5.41 6.68 B: nice to meet you 

7.49 11.20 A: um so we just engage in conversation then [noise] 

10.55 11.62 B: right 

12.17 16.02 B: so the topic is uh about disarming iraq 

16.95 21.95 A: yeah um [lipsmack] well my personal thoughts are that um 

22.56 31.26 A: we should engage with the united nations we should follow through with the planned um inspections to completion 

29.87 31.03 B: (( right um )) 

32.21 35.38 A: and if the pardon 

33.48 34.56 B: but what if 

35.39 39.81 B: going through the united nations does not get you the result 

40.00 42.58 B: that united states expect 

43.18 48.02 A: then i think that the best step for the united states were to um 

48.29 56.46 A: would be to form alliances with neighboring countries to put economic and diplomatic pressure on [sigh] 

56.58 62.13 A: iraq in other words make it economically beneficial for them and also 

62.44 63.73 A: socially 

63.75 71.44 A: [sigh] um beneficial for the leadership i don't think going in and [sigh] starting a war is going to 

71.51 77.09 A: make iraq feel any more secure about itself and therefore give up any means of defenses 

77.39 81.25 B: correct and that is my opinion too as far as 

81.34 84.09 B: (( war with iraq is concerned )) 

84.19 89.10 B: because war not only brings hardship to a lot of innocent people 

89.53 92.21 B: there are far greater consequences 

92.94 94.85 B: in terms of uh 

95.41 105.67 B: innoce- lots of innocent lives being destroyed and you don't know what what what kind of war would it lead to 

105.84 108.99 B: like how long it would last how many people would die 

109.39 110.88 B: and uh 

111.26 116.74 B: it it may spread over to more than just iraq like it may spread over to neighboring countries 

117.49 124.41 B: israel may be involved so you are not very sure like how the war's going to be fought 

125.03 126.26 B: but yes 

126.68 130.63 B: [lipsmack] the one thing that's disturbing me is weapons of mass destruction 

130.64 135.10 B: and united states should be forthright in 

135.34 139.22 B: giving out details or other evidences of 

139.24 141.33 B: that kind 

141.34 144.53 B: so that whatever iraq is portraying 

145.71 152.07 B: united states can tell the world that that it's not correct right 

151.67 160.72 A: i agree um based on the past relationship between iraq and the united states [sigh] um mainly their alliance to fight iran 

160.73 161.89 A: (( [sigh] um )) 

161.87 173.10 A: a lot of information and training was passed on to iraq that america hasn't made public and so it's another very good point you make [sigh] i think america could inform [sigh] the united nations 

173.08 181.60 A: um a lot more than it has on what potentials to expect from iraq in terms of their [sigh] their weapons of mass destruction 

181.51 182.59 B: right 

183.26 193.72 A: uh yeah i also agree to with um the innocents that really bothers me i don't think that this is actually even truly a war it just seem more like an [sigh] 

193.91 198.37 A: um an aggressive muscling of a sovereign nation to 

198.39 201.29 A: obey the will of uh of another 

201.60 210.15 A: [sigh] um even if the leadership of iran is of iraq sorry is very inconvenient it nevertheless is a sovereign country 

209.84 210.93 B: right 

211.84 216.33 B: nobody is saying that saddam is good of course like everyone knows 

217.04 222.87 B: he has done lots of uh things that are not appropriate but yes uh 

223.64 229.05 B: attacking anyone without evidence our without justification 

229.47 231.69 B: may cause hardships to everyone 

233.56 242.25 A: so [lipsmack] yeah i agree [sigh] ha i don't understand at all this rush um i think war should be the most serious of decisions 

242.29 244.39 A: and um just like with a 

244.68 252.04 A: a capital trial based on perhaps a person's um committing of a murder they have [sigh] many many appeals [sigh] 

252.14 262.39 A: they have no limit of time justice is the primary concern and that doesn't seem to be the the concern of the american government at this time 

261.86 265.77 B: right but you may have to also consider 

266.05 267.98 B: the 

268.15 275.06 B: the american government themselves what type of information they have maybe the information they have is too strong 

275.11 276.81 B: or too or 

277.61 279.09 B: what you may call 

279.42 281.61 B: that the information may be 

283.19 287.92 B: may be so strong that they can't pass it on over to the common public 

287.99 292.82 B: because there's always the fear that if information is spread out then 

293.11 296.00 B: maybe they know where the weapons of mass destruction 

296.26 301.74 B: it might give to them a chance to just relocate those weapons somewhere else 

302.68 306.24 A: yeah that that is a good point but um 

307.77 309.01 A: if they 

309.55 314.91 A: you see the if they do have all this amazing satellite um technology if they do [sigh] 

314.92 323.45 A: um maintain their their flying zones over the north and south of iraq i think that they would be easily in a position to monitor any 

323.70 331.71 A: um of the scale of movement required to move storage to move um laboratories those kinds of things 

331.58 333.45 B: (( right )) 

332.69 342.04 A: s- so i don't think it would be something that overnight iraq could change and get away with i think that america would be very carefully observing from every mean they every means they had [sigh] 

342.92 350.63 B: right but what about chemical and biological weapons like from what i heard it could be 

351.50 357.51 B: concealed in a such a small area that even the satellites wouldn't be able to detect it 

358.86 363.54 A: that's true but uh the movement itself unless it was done with 

363.55 366.32 A: preexisting underground tunnels which 

366.58 371.97 A: to my knowledge what i've read don't really exist if they ma- made a convoy of trucks 

372.15 373.45 A: if they um 

373.88 378.19 A: [lipsmack] uh established a new storage site i think um 

378.28 381.93 A: even the sm- smallest of buildings its construction could be 

382.17 383.89 A: monitored from 

383.96 388.95 A: comprehensive satellite imaging with flyover radar scans [sigh] 

389.09 393.15 A: um or even old fashioned intelligence gathering 

393.66 399.99 A: um yeah i i do know that just a small amount of chemical can cause a lot of damage [sigh] 

400.18 406.70 A: but i i still don't see that this whole idea of a sovereign country being attacked by another 

406.92 411.02 A: with just allegations is disturbing to me and um 

410.60 422.57 B: right [sigh] maybe then we all think that some things need to be changed but the manner in which the change has to be done should be different a bit different 

411.81 413.53 A: and until it's proven 

422.53 437.38 A: [lipsmack] yes i i don't think war i think [sigh] if we put as much effort into diplomacy with neighboring countries of iraq who h- who share a [sigh] religious um similarity and also a culture background [sigh] then i think with their 

437.31 438.87 A: gentle leanings 

438.88 441.02 A: they could um mold 

441.07 447.40 A: a different maybe a sense of security within iraq so they wouldn't feel the need to posture as they are right now 

447.65 460.00 B: right but hasn't united states tried that for a long time and they must surely have thought about all those possibilities before deciding on this course 

461.25 464.10 A: [lipsmack] [sigh] i don't know i think that um 

464.46 467.57 A: instability in the mid east has actually been 

467.94 475.17 A: something useful to the united states it's allowed them to build an in- incredibly lopsided power in the state of israel 

475.46 480.54 A: with all these alleged enemies and i think that if there was peace in the middle east um 

480.72 483.21 A: america would have a lot less of a 

483.26 487.00 A: a military presence and therefore a lot less of a 

487.74 488.72 A: um 

488.91 496.57 A: a deciding voice since we have never really seemed to approach things diplomatically we've had al- this country has always used its muscle [sigh] 

496.87 498.11 A: and um 

498.63 500.50 A: [lipsmack] i think that if it were to 

500.80 504.80 A: move towards diplomacy we'd get a lot more done 

504.84 514.15 A: [sigh] than what it's demonstrated so far just with force i find the [laughter] the arab people to be in their history a very resilient and remembering race 

511.26 512.95 B: right 

514.79 519.81 B: yeah but just diplomacy sometimes does not give you the desired result 

520.71 526.47 A: well yeah i i i always link diplomacy with something of benefit to them so 

526.75 531.95 A: um mil- um economic aid and development um 

530.77 531.78 B: (( [sigh] right )) 

532.58 537.54 A: on a similar par with what we've done with israel [sigh] if we were show those same 

535.42 536.38 B: (( right right )) 

538.04 538.99 A: um 

539.14 544.97 A: if that if we showed the same willingness to help develop some of those other poorer countries of which iraq is one 

545.30 549.90 A: [sigh] even though they do have a um a revenue from oil if we were to give them 

550.15 559.89 A: other means of uh developing themselves we'd establish a friendship base not just talk and rhetoric but actually an investment of our time money and expertise and technology [sigh] 

560.21 561.51 A: more like a 

561.86 568.64 A: a sitting down and explain to the [sigh] that we we aren't an enemy to be feared and hence armed against 

568.89 576.85 B: that that's absolutely essential that uh the people of iraq and the united states get closer closer to each other 

577.61 579.15 B: of course like 

579.31 582.58 B: but when it comes to engaging the people of iraq 

582.80 592.14 B: saddam would always come into prominence he's one guy whom we would have to deal with if united states had to deal with iraq 

592.72 599.45 B: and the u._s. is very uncomfortable with dealing with him as things stand right now
