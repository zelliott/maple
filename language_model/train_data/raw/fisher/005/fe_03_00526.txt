13.84 17.54 A: [laughter] [laughter] i have asthma so there you go 

17.07 20.68 B: [laughter] i have to go with gossiping i just think it creates 

20.82 24.12 B: so many problems in the end [laughter] 

23.52 24.98 A: hurts a lot of people 

24.62 26.04 B: exactly 

25.30 28.38 A: yeah i well i i agree with that part but 

28.51 36.94 B: yeah well i guess that as a smoker i can't agree with you well but then again actually i can because it really is bad but i do it anyway 

31.14 32.72 A: [laughter] 

36.75 45.46 A: oh i know it's one of those really hard things it's a well it's a horrible addiction it once it grabs a hold of you it's very difficult to stop my 

38.23 39.53 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

41.19 42.18 B: it is 

44.43 50.38 B: oh especially when you've been doing it for so many years exactly 

47.35 49.73 A: many years yeah my 

49.77 62.29 A: my parents smoked for a lot of years and then when i finally got pregnant i just i said you know i just can't can't be round it any more you're going to have to i went to their house and i said you're going to have to go outside [laughter] if i'm going to come and visit you 

57.44 58.36 B: [laughter] 

61.84 63.45 B: (( oh you w- )) 

62.61 71.41 A: so there you go and then they both stopped because they knew they couldn't be around th- one of my children has a genetic disorder too so couldn't and he's prone to cancer so 

71.29 72.33 B: (( oh [sigh] )) 

71.60 76.91 A: [lipsmack] i just said can't do it around my kids so they quit but you know they had a good reason so 

73.99 75.92 B: (( oh right )) 

76.38 84.94 B: well that's it i mean not only don't you do it but when you can get two other people to quit that's great [laughter] a crusader [laughter] 

80.45 83.36 A: [laughter] [laughter] there you go 

84.68 86.76 A: oh yeah do what you can do 

86.87 94.65 B: that's it [lipsmack] so i'm really not sure like i said i've never done this before so i don't know what they're looking for 

92.71 93.77 A: what's next 

94.03 102.48 A: i guess we just wait for the next question maybe if we i don't know what they do maybe they throw the next question at us it looked like something interesting to do though so 

102.26 107.61 B: or that's what i thought and i've actually done um surveys for [sigh] this same company 

107.04 108.02 A: have you

139.78 140.89 A: oh 

140.55 146.75 B: [lipsmack] yes and it was [sigh] quite devastating and i just decided to 

143.66 144.69 A: i'm sure

153.69 154.60 A: (( ahah )) 

154.51 164.02 B: [lipsmack] so of course i still pay the bills but [laughter] so and just decided you know i had some friends down here and i figured i'd give it a shot and 

156.13 157.21 A: oh sure 

163.11 165.05 A: well what a courageous thing you did 

165.00 172.07 B: yes and i i really do love it but i'm finding that you know every several months at the most i have to go back for a few weeks 

171.21 173.06 A: [noise] sure well 

172.10 174.31 B: because i just miss it so much [laughter] 

173.74 176.22 A: i'm sure he misses mom too so 

176.01 179.07 B: well he won't admit it but he does [sigh] [laughter] 

177.88 180.54 A: [laughter] if you're 

179.58 183.33 B: he likes mom to come home and cook and clean the house [laughter]

188.22 189.63 B: i was twenty 

189.23 193.62 A: yeah see [laughter] well you're about my age then 

190.29 192.49 B: (( [laughter] ))

197.00 199.68 B: (( and little ones s- s- so )) 

199.72 212.05 B: no there's something to be said for that living your life first and then having them [sigh] my sisters were much older when they had theirs and i think it's nice to have them young too because now i'm still young enough to do what i want 

207.37 208.26 A: (( w- what )) 

210.56 211.69 A: right 

211.73 224.04 A: yeah yeah yeah oh i i think there's pros and cons both ways part of me wishes i would have done it sooner 'cause now i'm going to be old [laughter] wh- [laughter] [sigh] so you know well i'm already old but you know 

213.60 214.41 B: (( so um )) 

216.15 217.39 B: exactly 

219.83 222.72 B: [laughter] [laughter] how old are they 

224.12 225.66 B: how old are yours 

224.22 231.76 A: when they when they grow up i'm s- forty three and so you know when they're when they're leaving college i'm going to be [cough] older so 

231.11 231.94 B: (( ahah )) 

232.28 234.41 A: so pros and cons both ways 

234.12 237.70 B: [laughter] mm yeah oh i guess that i don't have any regrets i mean 

237.88 248.42 B: you know my sisters are finding you know a little difficult now especially my youngest one [sigh] my youngest sister she waited quite late [sigh] and she's got her hands full [laughter] 

247.21 249.52 A: [noise] yeah how many does she have 

249.20 252.70 B: she has two but they were both born with a lot of um 

252.96 261.07 B: stomach problems and th- that kind of thing so they didn't sleep through the night and they were in and out of the hospital and 

254.32 255.71 A: (( [noise] oh [noise] )) 

258.55 259.62 A: oh 

259.93 262.03 A: oh how hard 

261.24 268.09 B: [sigh] they never told her that there was a good chance the second one would have the same problems or she said she never would have had another one 

265.69 266.92 A: oh 

267.79 271.80 A: oh that's just heart breaking so it's something inherited 

269.62 270.80 B: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

271.25 272.25 B: yes 

272.27 274.04 B: yes i mean they're doing 

272.79 274.06 A: (( do you know what it is )) 

274.08 284.06 B: i don't recall exactly [sigh] but i mean she would come over and feed them a bottle and they would try to take a little bit and then they would just scream because of the pain 

283.57 284.85 A: oh 

284.53 289.08 B: and they were in and out of the hospital you know for not eating and that kind of thing and 

288.46 289.61 A: oh 

289.41 295.56 B: yeah it was pretty bad they're older now they're uh almost three and six now 

295.35 297.25 A: and are they better or not 

296.20 303.42 B: and they're better but i don't know if you know it has anything to do with it but they're very whiny children [laughter] 

303.35 304.47 A: (( [laughter] great )) 

303.86 306.48 B: [laughter] very difficult to deal with 

306.80 312.17 A: [laughter] boy that says a lot from somebody who doesn't even live with them to have [laughter] 

310.90 317.90 B: [sigh] exactly very loud very whiny just as i said very difficult to deal with they're a handful [laughter] 

312.20 313.06 A: yeah 

314.13 315.05 A: oh 

317.93 324.74 B: so and i'm used to m- you know mine was just so quiet and entertained himself and that kind of thing so 

322.74 323.82 A: yeah 

324.73 326.93 A: oh she sounds like she has her hands full 

326.50 329.17 B: and she works about sixty hours a week [sigh] 

328.75 329.90 A: oh my goodness 

329.55 330.92 B: mhm 

330.27 331.71 A: (( oh yes )) 

331.09 340.48 B: and her husband works mostly nights and weekends so when she's you know off of work she's with the kids by herself so there's like no break [laughter] 

337.65 338.49 A: sure 

340.27 342.81 A: yeah she's a stressed woman isn't she 

342.11 343.85 B: exactly [laughter] 

343.31 345.40 A: and how far away do you live from her 

345.13 353.24 B: [sigh] oh well actually i was about two hours from her she's in connecticut [sigh] but now of course i'm more like ten or eleven hours from her [laughter] 

349.08 349.87 A: (( ahah )) 

352.53 353.64 A: oh 

353.58 357.25 B: but you know like i said i go back to new york every few months [sigh] 

356.07 357.33 A: (( [noise] sure )) 

357.31 368.73 B: and you know i figure that will be for the rest of my life or as long as i'm in north carolina because you know that's where my family and [sigh] a lot of my friends are so [sigh] i'll never let go [laughter] 

368.09 370.29 A: yeah well that's good 

369.85 376.45 B: [sigh] yes i just kind of bounce back and forth and [sigh] you know kind of have the best of both worlds i guess [laughter] 

376.92 378.67 A: [noise] well that's good 

377.88 378.66 B: (( oh )) 

378.72 380.94 B: (( it's nice [noise] oh i hear yours now )) 

380.68 383.96 A: yeah they're entertaining each other so there you go 

383.68 386.58 B: oh that's a good thing how far apart are they in age 

385.67 386.82 A: two years 

386.81 387.89 B: ooh 

387.86 393.98 A: [laughter] well see this is what happens when you're old and you have kids you have to [laughter] hurry up and get it done [laughter] 

388.33 390.47 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

393.92 396.22 B: [laughter] yeah two years though that's a 

396.44 398.98 B: that's fighting age when they get a little older 

398.65 403.02 A: uh-huh well they'll they'll probably be best friends and um 

403.17 406.94 A: and they're just close enough to pick on each other at the same time so 

406.37 407.82 B: mhm 

407.34 409.69 A: it's a good thing and a hard thing so 

409.54 416.10 B: mm yeah i'm the middle of three girls and my older sister is only eleven months older than me

513.41 514.65 A: mhm 

515.75 519.40 A: and it's one of those professions that you can pretty much do wherever you go 

519.16 520.51 B: exactly 

519.99 521.36 A: oh that's good 

520.53 530.73 B: exactly in fact one of th- that was another reason why i chose to come down here because within a few months [sigh] of my marriage ending the place i was working went out of business

546.20 547.34 A: wow 

547.26 548.18 B: so 

548.24 551.29 A: well that's i ki- sounds like it kind of came 

551.46 556.03 A: i- i- in a at a time that kinda helped to make a decision to make big changes in your life 

555.93 565.26 B: [sigh] that's true it did and you know [sigh] some people say well you really haven't made a decision you're kind of going back and forth and i said well it's working for me right now 

556.59 558.46 A: (( [noise] yes [noise] )) 

564.64 566.03 A: (( [noise] sure )) 

565.72 577.13 B: so [sigh] and my son was very dependent on his mom being that i was a stay at home mom and this has given him a chance to get a little more independence without being left totally on his own 

570.88 571.87 A: (( [noise] sure )) 

572.48 573.42 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

576.83 579.34 A: ahah kind of that in between stage

590.20 598.78 B: [sigh] yeah he's um you know he's still a little angry with his dad that the whole thing ended because his dad i guess mid life crisis decided to have an affair [lipsmack] 

598.31 599.95 A: [noise] [lipsmack] yeah
