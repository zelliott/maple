80.32 82.41 A: the way i kind of follow is what you hear about 

82.64 91.38 A: in the news or or on the ads for the shows you know they'll say well so and so got kicked off last week so you kind of keep updated just by the commercials

120.53 121.67 B: mhm 

121.42 127.10 A: because i don't know i just i don't know i wouldn't want to try and meet someone that way huh

142.99 144.25 B: yeah 

144.07 145.73 A: i don't know i i think 

145.88 146.17 A: that 

146.57 147.45 A: like uh 

148.14 150.61 A: there's the one reality show where they're just 

150.77 155.22 A: ridiculous it it's the real dangerous one where kids are actually trying it and getting killed 

155.23 157.12 B: oh yes 

157.58 158.37 B: oh 

158.89 160.35 A: i can't remember the name of that one 

161.46 162.43 B: oh i know what you mean 

162.10 168.40 A: the one episode that comes to mind is the kid leaning out the car to see how close his face could come to the pavement 

168.51 169.66 B: oh my gosh 

169.36 178.07 A: yeah yeah and there was another one that um i think the father there's an actual father that's suing the company for um 

170.97 171.32 B: oh 

178.30 182.14 A: some kid had jumped on a car while it was going 

183.09 183.77 A: and 

184.00 189.86 A: they had done it on t._v. like that and then his kid had done it and died well duh heh heh

197.76 198.23 A: you know 

198.82 200.65 A: it was really odd 

201.09 205.37 A: but i don't know i think sometimes i think the reason these are so popular is because 

208.09 210.07 A: i don't know people don't have a life 

210.25 210.67 A: huh 

210.80 211.89 A: (( kind of )) you know

222.01 222.54 B: yeah 

222.44 227.63 A: you know instead of and then and then you got the ridiculous ones that actually go out and try and do this 

227.42 228.11 B: i know 

227.79 229.25 A: so huh huh huh 

229.56 230.97 A: goes a little too far

260.63 262.32 A: okay okay 

262.81 263.84 B: at least that's what they did 

263.93 265.14 B: so and then uh 

266.03 269.10 B: another automated voice comes on i think to tell you i'm not sure 

269.56 270.15 A: wow 

271.86 276.02 A: well that's kind of interesting it's kind of weird you wonder what they're what they're actually studying

354.90 356.78 A: really yeah i like t._v. shows 

356.63 356.98 B: if you 

357.48 362.25 B: clicking through the t._v. and stuff and you find something you know it'll catch my eye and i'll watch five 

362.52 365.52 B: five minutes or so you know like american idol 

367.19 367.67 B: uh 

367.78 370.34 B: last night you know i watched a few of those and 

371.17 374.57 B: kind of thought how ridiculous it was and how silly and 

373.41 373.89 A: yeah 

374.53 377.06 A: yeah they they catch your eye with the 

377.59 380.03 A: with the action and then what 

380.13 383.58 A: you see after you get into it then you realize it's ridiculous 

384.61 387.49 A: i don't know too many people that really stick with that 

387.83 388.38 B: mhm 

388.29 394.71 A: i've met a couple people but most of the people i know are just like yeah i've seen an episode here i've seen an episode there 

395.37 396.19 A: so 

397.20 399.68 B: yeah that's probably about yeah i don't know anyone who really 

400.46 402.06 B: you know follows it or 

402.68 403.51 A: the first one 

403.88 407.82 A: i remember the first one was a big thing like the first survivor show 

407.67 408.57 B: oh yeah 

408.56 409.03 A: that was a 

409.17 416.32 A: big big thing and i think after that it was just ridiculous and i think some people just tune in to see how silly they can get 

417.10 419.72 A: you know and th- i mean we every once in a while that's why i i'll 

419.99 424.67 A: stay on that channel just to see okay what are they (( gonna )) do this is (( gonna )) be ridiculous 

424.77 429.15 A: you know sometime during this show during this program they are going to do something totally ridiculous 

425.53 426.03 B: yeah 

431.65 434.01 A: oh yeah ow god 

432.44 433.04 B: huh huh huh 

433.65 434.38 B: oh ha huh huh 

434.94 436.35 A: this is ridiculous 

440.59 443.48 A: i think that's why they came up with the dangerous one 

444.23 446.99 A: because you know you got to get the top ratings and and 

447.37 452.26 A: you have so many kids that watch t._v. i mean that they i mean they're (( gonna )) wa- i mean they're your target 

452.25 453.58 B: yeah -at's right yeah 

453.07 454.65 A: you know and so 

454.58 456.71 B: isn't that on like m._t._v. or something that one 

457.08 463.78 A: i'm not sure i'm not sure i haven't seen it i've just heard about it and i've heard that it's caused a lot of problems 

461.41 461.99 B: yeah 

465.20 471.33 A: but i mean you know these rou- it's like my husband was sayin- these shows they're not (( gonna )) have you out there where you're (( gonna )) get 

471.43 471.94 A: where you 

472.26 477.69 A: i mean you're on an island they're not (( gonna )) have you somewhere where you're actually (( gonna )) be in danger 

477.70 478.84 B: that's true yeah 

478.59 486.81 A: you know so they're (( gonna )) make sure that you have food they're (( gonna )) make sure you have water they're not (( gonna )) let you die you know ha ha and these people i mean the it's get- 

487.37 488.93 A: they would get sued if they did 

489.49 492.21 A: so these people are just like well you know 

489.57 490.49 B: mhm 

492.33 495.70 A: oh no if we don't if we don't get some fish or something we're (( gonna )) die 

495.56 496.39 B: hee huh huh huh 

496.21 499.26 A: well they're not (( gonna )) die they're not (( gonna )) let you die -cause you'd sue -em 

499.16 506.46 B: that's right and so much of it is edited i'm sure that it 

500.92 503.08 A: so it's almost not reality 

506.30 506.88 A: mhm 

506.85 507.46 B: you use 

507.98 508.52 B: you know 

509.56 512.62 B: use everything one way or the other to make it more exciting and 

512.44 513.05 A: right 

513.24 513.79 A: right 

515.10 517.32 A: but i don't know if sponsors pay for it 

517.60 518.94 B: that i guess (( i- )) 

519.42 522.99 A: coca cola and sierra mist and all those places they really they pay for it 

525.11 526.96 B: car companies you know with their 

527.69 528.57 A: oh yeah 

530.50 534.55 B: one contestant wins some sort of car or something in one of their contests and it's like hey 

534.71 540.81 A: right yeah and you think i mean you look at those and you think yeah it would be nice to win that hummer or whatever 

540.39 541.01 B: mhm 

540.95 543.63 A: but it's not like you're actually (( gonna )) go i mean 

543.81 544.65 A: i don't know 

544.89 550.70 A: i guess it puts it in y- the commercial puts it in your mind that you know there's this vehicle but 

550.79 553.71 A: when i go to look for a car i'm not thinking of the commercials i've seen 

564.68 565.57 B: mhm 

572.45 573.47 B: yeah
