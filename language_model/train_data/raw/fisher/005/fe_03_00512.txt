59.89 62.49 B: not yet anyway i've been doing good so far 

60.60 64.39 A: yeah that's pretty good have you you've been your whole life or is it like a recent 

64.63 65.76 B: last couple of years 

65.85 67.58 A: that you've got you've had diabetes 

67.58 68.08 B: yeah 

67.93 69.34 A: you've been diagnosed yeah 

68.98 69.36 B: mhm 

69.93 70.40 A: wow 

71.24 82.65 A: that's i i have some friends i have some pretty close friends that are diabetic so i've been kind of learning about that whole thing myself and actually my uncle had some health problems with that when he was older too so 

82.50 82.92 B: mhm 

83.20 83.55 A: it's 

83.68 85.22 A: important to control it 

85.25 85.88 B: yeah 

86.79 90.52 A: um okay i think what was the other question something like 

91.32 94.35 A: if you go to the doctor in seven days 

95.42 95.91 A: it's 

96.92 99.36 A: you catch the cold faster or something like that 

99.75 101.11 A: do you remember the second question 

101.18 102.98 B: eh i think it's that um 

103.21 103.49 B: it 

103.68 106.35 B: it last seven days if you don't 

106.46 106.98 A: okay 

107.21 109.69 B: go to the doctor and if you do 

109.94 112.34 B: i think it says seven days too so i didn't get it 

111.73 114.83 A: well wasn't weren't they talking about like the flu or the cold 

115.24 116.19 B: cold yeah 

115.31 119.23 A: i mean because i thought that you can't get a shot or anything for that 

119.91 128.43 A: you know i mean i've been to the doctor with the flu and they basically just said to or like a cold or a flu and they just said to ride it out -cause it's a virus so i don't know 

128.53 132.36 A: exactly what a doctor would do for you if you went in right away anyway 

132.58 134.13 B: yeah i don't see that point 

133.93 134.91 A: i don't either 

135.01 137.26 A: and you know what i was sick um 

137.80 145.08 A: i got real sick last winter and i happened to be at the doctors office for something else and i was coming down with like 

145.21 149.11 A: the flu and i was so sick and um 

149.29 151.62 A: they there was supposed to be like a flu shot 

152.07 156.53 A: that they that they can give you now but they have to give it to you like within the first twenty four hours 

156.93 157.41 B: yeah 

157.28 166.20 A: and um the doctor didn't have it in stock so i didn't get to try it out and i was really bummed about that and i ended up being like probably the sickest i'd ever been in my whole life 

166.79 175.08 A: so if you ever get sick and you ha- you happen to be at your doctor ask about the shot and see if you can get it but it has to be like within the first twenty four hours 

174.62 175.64 B: first day yeah 

175.79 176.28 A: so 

177.07 178.28 A: um 

178.93 182.73 A: is this your first time doing this or 

182.33 182.96 B: yeah 

183.07 183.97 A: yeah me too 

184.64 187.18 A: it's kind of weird to talk to a stranger and about 

187.44 188.94 A: personal kind of stuff but 

191.83 192.53 A: um 

194.90 196.08 A: let's see 

197.44 199.75 B: what else do we do 

198.62 203.87 A: i think we're supposed to just talk about the topic for ten minutes and they until they tell us that we're done 

205.17 205.73 B: uh-huh 

206.03 206.81 A: so 

206.94 208.97 A: do you have any thoughts to add on 

209.27 210.35 A: your illness or 

209.49 213.50 B: i don't want to catch any colds i drink lots of orange juice and 

213.08 213.48 A: yeah 

213.85 215.41 B: and all that stuff and 

215.85 220.13 B: so far it's been good -cause i can't af- you know when you catch a cold and diabetic 

220.47 221.02 A: yeah 

220.87 223.38 B: it throws your sugar off so bad isn't funny 

223.49 224.24 A: oh really 

224.38 234.83 B: you can't do things like you just can't eat -cause then your sugar will go way down and you don't feel like eating and when your sick anyways and you have to eat to level off your blood 

233.94 236.52 A: so can you drink orange juice when you're a diabetic 

236.13 236.64 B: yeah 

236.83 237.45 A: you can 

238.02 240.66 A: do you do do you like do insulin shots

245.18 245.84 A: really

255.98 258.04 A: that's the same thing happened to my uncle 

258.37 259.73 A: that's the same thing 

259.94 261.77 A: are you are you older or 

259.96 260.37 B: mhm

268.39 271.28 A: god sixties or seventies when that happened 

272.05 273.00 A: but um 

273.76 279.38 A: i mean (( but )) i- if you just like really control your blood sugar and everything thought doesn't that help with the whole um 

278.78 280.52 B: oh yeah you check your you 

279.56 281.24 A: the circulation and everything 

280.98 284.70 B: you check your blood sugar regularly and everything and everyday i 

284.94 289.37 B: just look at my feet so i wont get any more infections and lose anything else 

289.12 289.76 A: right 

290.60 296.33 A: do you have to uh i mean do you have to do like prick your finger with like my friend ha- like pricks it like i think right before she eats 

294.31 294.87 B: yeah 

297.16 298.45 B: well yeah you know you 

298.62 300.20 B: do before you eat breakfast 

300.48 303.15 B: during maybe eating lunch and then you know before you eat supper 

303.21 303.77 A: yeah 

303.32 304.64 B: i do it three times a day 

305.21 315.43 A: yeah i mean i'm just kind of worried too because like i said i mean my uncle had it and um you know i i i've i had like struggled with -eight with weight problems my whole life and um 

315.53 316.23 B: yeah 

315.99 321.28 A: they say that if you're over weight when you get older um you can develop like adult 

321.53 323.23 A: diabetes or whatever 

323.26 323.92 B: yeah 

323.59 327.62 A: so did they have did they give you any ideas about why they thought you developed it or 

327.95 329.19 B: um 

329.40 333.03 B: you know at the time i was i was a little over weight and you know you just 

332.01 332.53 A: right 

333.18 335.96 B: with an infection you can't screw around with it 

335.74 336.21 A: right 

336.81 341.82 A: no i mean getting the diabetes in the first place -cause didn't you say you just got diagnosed with that a couple years ago 

341.93 342.40 B: mhm 

342.60 343.75 A: yeah so did they 

343.91 348.08 A: did they have any ideas i mean was it like a weight problem or just like a hereditary thing or 

348.35 352.41 B: um it could have been a hereditary thing because my grandfather 

352.70 353.69 B: died from it 

354.14 355.44 A: oh wow okay 

355.70 357.06 A: so yeah that's kind of 

357.85 359.84 B: kind of runs in the family i guess 

358.78 360.60 A: yeah that's what i'm like 

360.11 360.62 B: somewhat 

361.03 366.60 A: kind of thinking too so i'm trying to you know watch the weight and exercise did they tell you to exercise 

367.25 371.46 B: yeah i um exercise is good for you anyways keeps your cholesterol 

370.22 372.19 A: yeah no matter what it's good for you 

372.58 376.14 A: but i didn't know uh -cause i mean i i would think it would help with the circulation 

377.37 378.39 B: yeah um 

379.12 384.30 A: -cause isn't that like one of the problems with diabetes is that you have circulation problems that's why you have problems with your feet right 

381.18 388.94 B: yeah that's why i check my feet you know it's hard to get rid of an infection too or even a cut or whatever you got to look out for 

389.14 389.75 A: right 

390.26 390.74 A: hm 

390.91 392.01 B: oh yeah

514.23 514.84 B: yeah 

514.91 518.82 A: i mean you're just like waiting for the sunlight to come out it gets kind of pathetic after a while

532.89 535.37 A: i- exactly exactly 

538.96 541.40 A: well let's see i don't kn- even know what else we can talk about 

541.78 543.60 B: i don't know either it's like 

542.65 548.93 A: i i don't know how much we can talk -cause they said at the end of the conversation they're supposed to like tell us that it's been like ten minutes 

549.44 550.74 A: that's what it said 

551.00 551.73 B: hm 

551.14 551.92 A: in this thing

557.42 558.02 B: yeah 

559.35 560.13 A: so
