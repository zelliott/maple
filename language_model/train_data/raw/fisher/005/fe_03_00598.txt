56.95 57.66 A: yeah 

59.10 62.05 B: one of the best best times about christmas and spending time 

60.92 61.44 A: right 

62.37 63.93 B: with my family and my 

64.38 65.72 B: other family you know parent

67.08 68.22 B: whatever 

68.39 69.67 B: and how about you 

69.89 77.34 A: um i i love christmas i'd say my fe- my favorite one is easter and really there's two reasons behind it the first one is i'm an adoptee 

77.68 81.52 A: and my parents brought me home um the sunday before easter easter sunday 

81.49 81.85 B: mhm 

82.01 87.35 A: so i always kind of correlate my coming home you know to my family to easter and 

87.69 96.39 A: it being almost like in renewal because you know winter time everything's dead the grass everything seems seems kind of you know especially this time year after christmas everything seems kind of sad and 

96.67 97.31 B: right 

96.79 102.43 A: you know bleak and everything and when i think with easter and spring it kind of brings forth the flowers the grass and 

103.56 106.09 A: it's kind of like a new beginning i guess way i like to look at it 

106.16 109.08 B: no that's it's a perfect reason that a whole reborn 

109.27 109.78 B: thing 

110.11 110.67 B: you know 

110.75 111.61 A: right 

111.30 111.69 B: yeah 

113.13 115.10 B: okay 

113.79 117.81 A: i think we're supposed to say now uh if we had a holi- if we could make up a holiday or something 

116.65 118.10 B: if we could make a holiday 

118.69 120.05 A: oh god uh 

119.54 124.27 B: that's a tough one i think they're all taken no um 

126.19 127.44 A: hmm a mother's 

126.69 128.37 B: if i could make a holiday 

128.21 128.70 A: okay 

128.63 136.88 B: what i think would be neat and this is probably totally crazy but um to have sort of um some kind of 

137.81 138.61 B: an eth- 

138.72 139.43 B: ethnic 

139.53 140.21 B: um 

140.89 142.11 B: back to root 

142.54 144.65 B: kind of a holiday um 

143.84 144.30 A: uh-huh 

145.33 147.28 B: a heri- kind of a heritage holiday 

148.16 149.21 B: um that everyone could 

149.31 151.89 B: celebrate by i don't know having 

152.45 161.55 B: you know they're ethnic food i'm italian so it would be neat you know to make all italian food um play italian music 

154.48 155.00 A: uh-huh 

161.73 163.74 B: and you know and my next door neighbor 

164.16 166.53 B: i don't know english they could you know celebrate 

167.45 168.15 B: you know i 

168.29 169.04 B: i don't know that's 

169.46 171.45 B: that's just what i'm thinking off the top of my head 

169.49 169.86 A: yeah 

171.62 174.93 A: where there's me and thinking that (( )) it would kind of introduce people to new cultures 

174.92 176.94 B: exactly and you could you know experience 

177.25 180.01 B: someone else's like you just said you know with them too 

180.44 184.80 B: so yeah uh that would be neat i don't know when i'd have it 

181.75 182.82 A: oh that is a good one 

184.88 189.65 A: something of a month where there's actually no holiday to celebrate but i think every month pretty much has something going on 

189.61 191.45 B: yeah pretty much 

191.26 191.67 A: huh 

191.67 194.89 B: and there's only twelve months to choose from 

194.71 196.15 A: we're set to have a new month 

195.81 198.99 B: yeah that's that's another thing 

199.85 200.53 A: oh gosh 

199.92 202.71 B: instead of celebrate a new a new year will have a new month 

202.15 204.04 A: there you go there you go 

205.09 214.22 A: i cannot think of course i don't have that question approached or anything or asked i cannot i can't eve- i can't even think of anything as far as a a holiday that i would do i like your idea 

214.49 216.34 B: oh okay thanks 

215.29 218.07 A: (( )) i uh 

218.74 225.48 B: well what's weird because i think we just get so used to celebrating yeah we just celebrated martin luther king day and now we're getting ready for valentine's day and it 

225.80 230.18 B: ya- you know everything follows in a pattern so it would be so hard to stick something else in 

230.07 230.57 A: right 

231.51 235.58 A: well it can't be different and two everybody brings in a different background 

235.70 236.08 B: mhm 

235.76 237.19 A: and (( )) we kind of need 

237.72 241.30 A: for children to kind of notice that there heritage is far as know 

241.76 246.95 A: native americans or italian or anything like that cause i really don't know anything about my background so therefore it be kind of neat 

247.23 248.24 A: to experience other people 

247.60 247.99 B: yeah 

249.03 250.97 A: (( )) i mean it brings a new twist to it 

250.87 253.38 B: yeah it does it would i think it would be kind of neat 

253.47 253.85 A: mhm 

253.71 256.57 B: and for people you know to have pride in where they came from 

256.77 257.62 A: right
