4.63 5.82 B: have you done this before 

5.95 7.34 A: um no this is the first time 

7.53 8.82 B: this is my first call too 

8.84 9.93 A: oh okay 

9.58 12.51 B: so i guess we are suppose to talk about reality t._v. 

12.24 14.96 A: yeah and um i actually don't watch them 

15.17 16.31 B: oh you don't how come 

15.91 16.21 A: i 

16.46 21.50 A: i d- well i just don't really enjoy them that much and i believe that the reason 

21.94 28.14 A: that there are so many of them on the air is because it's a lot less expensive then hiring writers and actors 

28.34 29.77 B: absolutely yep 

30.37 30.67 A: so 

30.37 31.66 B: yeah it isn't ah 

31.80 39.28 B: ah cost them hardly any money and some the you know where they only get he fifty thousand is quit cheap for them 

36.42 36.83 A: yeah 

38.54 40.02 A: yeah it's really cheap for them 

40.95 50.13 B: now we actually watch it quit a bit around here and ah lately since there's so many we've been you know on this past week that i new we've been watching them and yeah i i enjoy it 

50.27 51.58 A: which ones do you like best 

51.65 57.63 B: well i like the survivor is our favorite we- and then big brother but that's only on once or twice a year 

53.94 54.32 A: yeah 

57.83 58.28 A: uh-huh 

58.37 62.98 B: um and then now we're into now we just started watching joe millionaire 

63.27 65.34 A: oh really 

65.77 68.91 A: i didn't like the whole premise of that show 

68.44 70.15 B: well i'm 

69.33 71.27 A: that kind of bugs me a little bit 

70.56 76.11 B: well i think we're just going to wait to see their reaction you know whether he's rich or not but um 

73.53 74.03 A: yeah 

76.22 84.90 B: you know and then you've been reading all the tabloids saying well maybe he really does have money so that that kind of takes the fun away from that one 

84.51 85.47 A: yeah 

85.25 92.23 B: but ah yeah we just got done watching the last survivor and you know waiting for the next one to come in but that's are you know favorite one that we actually tape 

92.73 93.26 A: yeah 

93.31 98.27 B: and you get you know cause it's kind of fun to watch the different characters and see how you know they interact 

98.98 102.75 B: ah you know and what happens to them and how they all think they are going to be big super stars when they're done 

103.42 108.00 B: and they're not going to be you don't see to many around anymore 

106.31 106.78 A: i 

107.64 110.29 A: ah they they pass pretty quickly 

110.47 111.74 B: um hm uh-huh 

112.17 116.08 A: and what you know it i think it would be fun to 

116.88 117.76 A: actually 

118.77 120.17 A: be involved with it 

120.44 121.49 A: you know like to be 

122.00 124.30 A: one of the people on the show that might be kind of fun 

124.57 125.31 B: right 

125.43 125.77 A: but 

125.44 126.16 B: right 

126.13 129.80 A: as as far as watching it i'm not really very interested in it 

130.18 131.10 A: so 

131.44 131.82 A: i just 

132.13 132.76 A: i don't know i just 

134.57 139.20 A: i i watch more stuff on um arts and entertainment and discovery 

138.70 139.45 B: um hm 

139.90 143.49 A: um i like to watch shows that i can learn something from and i don't 

143.04 150.01 B: right yeah that we're that's another big one we're big into discovery channel and i like like ah the crime ones and 

146.93 147.82 A: yeah 

149.75 150.96 A: oh yeah 

150.65 152.75 B: i know it 

152.16 155.49 A: the court t._v. has some really good stuff on saturday nights 

155.63 163.06 B: oh i know it i love that too yeah we started to get away from like regular t._v. that's you know the sitcoms and ah 

157.66 158.20 A: yeah 

162.70 163.25 A: yeah 

163.25 166.14 B: you know i don't really you know watch to much you know the 

166.65 169.20 B: the drama shows lately it's just either been you know 

168.47 170.30 A: i have been watching e._r. though 

170.56 174.77 B: oh i haven't been we i got out of that i don't know wh- i think after all the major stars left 

174.92 175.65 A: oh yeah 

175.82 184.46 B: you know and then we sort of got out of that one and then practice and then that you know like that and we tend to go more toward the discovery and biography 

183.20 183.62 A: yeah 

184.74 186.41 A: oh yeah i like biography too 

184.89 185.51 B: those 

185.96 194.29 B: i love that one too and ah but yeah the reality ones you know i'm not i don't know why i find them interesting 

187.60 188.16 A: yeah 

194.53 196.35 A: yeah well i think it's just 

195.09 195.60 B: it's just 

196.53 200.83 A: just the fact of of looking in on other peoples lives probably 

206.58 207.99 A: um yeah uh 

208.11 213.10 B: and then we sit there and think well can we could you eat that you know would you do that would you do that and 

211.38 211.79 A: uh-huh 

212.44 217.11 A: yeah i i think i've caught little bits and pieces of 

217.34 219.22 A: of different ones and 

219.83 220.23 A: i just 

220.33 221.00 A: sa- they just 

221.18 222.90 A: it hasn't been enough to pull me in 

223.14 225.36 B: well yeah and some of the like like 

225.67 229.82 B: ah survivor and big brother you really have to watch from the beginning 

229.91 230.36 A: right 

234.05 234.46 A: yeah 

237.44 237.74 B: what 

237.83 242.39 B: playing maybe what twice a week or something for the people that do miss them because if you do miss them you miss a lot 

242.84 244.88 A: yeah ah like twenty four you know ah 

245.12 248.51 A: i watched twenty four and i don't know anyone else who does yeah 

248.09 252.90 B: yeah i don't watch that one and and i want to but i don't know why i don't because i heard it is so good 

250.34 251.14 A: and you have to 

251.88 252.22 A: fo- 

252.99 256.46 A: because you really have to see every episode you can't miss an episode 

255.91 258.38 B: oh so yeah it runs like that too 

257.50 261.43 A: so it's you know that's probably the same way survivor and everything is 

261.04 261.85 B: mm hm 

262.02 263.75 A: i'm mean there's so much going on 

262.21 262.64 B: yeah 

264.03 265.36 A: that you have to keep track of 

265.39 275.03 B: yeah and it's the little you know and like who fought with this one and why aren't they getting along with that one and what if you didn't see it the previous week then you are just totally out of the loop 

274.69 275.51 A: exactly 

275.82 276.53 B: you know 

275.87 276.19 A: and 

276.31 276.73 A: yeah 

276.98 277.36 A: so 

277.61 284.16 B: and that's why think a lot of them they should you know run you know like repeat it at say at like eleven o'clock at night or something if you don't get to tape it 

284.62 287.35 A: well yeah and if i if i miss twenty four i could always 

287.46 287.84 A: catch 

288.44 293.20 A: um that episode that sunday before the episode on f._x. 

293.38 298.75 B: yeah see that's nice and i see they are doing that a lot more with different shows too even the 

295.07 295.45 A: the 

297.76 298.43 A: yeah and the 

298.89 300.29 A: that's that's a good thing 

300.57 305.86 B: mm hm yep some of the talk shows i've seen some of them are repeating on a different channel too 

305.36 306.27 A: oh really 

306.46 312.39 B: uh-huh like the view or something like i catch that on but it's the repeat from the day before 

312.32 313.34 A: oh okay 

313.45 315.20 B: so i think they're start in to learn that 

316.36 321.45 B: and then i and as far as big brother another big plus about that is it's in the summer when nothing else is on 

321.82 323.78 A: oh okay yeah that might be a good thing 

323.41 326.01 B: you know instead of me watching all the reruns of anything 

326.07 326.71 A: yeah 

326.47 329.01 B: you know it's a nice fresh show something different 

329.28 330.43 B: and so that helps 

330.70 334.02 A: yeah and plus um we have tivo here and so 

333.96 336.71 B: oh, how nice do you like that 

336.79 342.91 A: well i i like it when i have control over it but my roommate has it's his tivo and so 

343.11 347.26 A: he is the one who determines what it's going to tape so 

346.98 349.39 B: oh 

348.05 350.49 A: so when i sit down and want to watch t._v. it's 

350.78 351.03 A: it's 

351.38 354.24 A: the model that we have doesn't allow you 

354.46 357.23 A: to watch anything else but what's being recorded 

357.64 359.77 A: or what's already been recorded 

359.50 360.79 B: oh okay 

360.03 360.53 A: so if 

360.90 362.34 A: something that i want to watch 

362.45 365.76 A: is not what's being recorded and hasn't then it's not on the list 

366.34 369.53 A: of things that's already been recorded i have to watch it somewhere else 

369.81 370.77 B: um 

370.77 371.94 A: and that kind of ticks me off 

372.13 374.55 B: yeah well that would be ch- 

372.82 373.09 A: the 

373.95 379.67 A: but you know if it was my personal tivo and it was full of stuff that i like to watch it's a great technology 

380.28 384.85 B: yeah the only thing i heard is that it's hard to program or hard to figure out how to use 

384.66 388.84 A: well um actually it's bases on a lynx operating system and 

388.45 396.34 B: oh well then that would leave me out i'm still trying to figure out how to copy and paste 

390.27 392.31 A: oh 

393.81 398.69 A: oh no control c control v 

398.44 407.23 B: oh i'm so terrible i'm you know just learning all this stuff you know you get paste a certain age you never learn that stuff in school so 

406.61 410.41 A: oh i know you know they never they didn't even have computers when i was going to school 

410.51 413.16 B: no we just had even the old fashion typewriters you know 

412.92 413.59 A: ah 

414.04 417.26 B: and i think the electric just came in 

415.86 416.48 A: yeah 

417.04 417.46 A: yeah it was 

417.82 421.37 A: they they just got brand new electric typewriters when i was in junior high 

424.28 424.80 A: yeah 

424.89 433.66 B: oh one day i will figure it out then i don't know how i got hooked up on this thing it was on something sign up here and of course i did it it sounded interesting 

432.72 435.90 A: well but it was kind of interesting it was kind of interesting you know i do a lot of surveys 

436.01 437.87 A: on on the internet and ah 

437.45 439.32 B: oh okay yeah i do too 

438.83 439.28 A: at 

439.73 441.39 A: yeah and um like

453.95 455.03 A: so it must of have been 

455.26 456.94 A: it must of been in one of those lists 

457.22 462.02 B: yes yeah i think i got mine off of what big big savings or 

458.42 458.72 A: but 

461.57 462.24 A: oh could be 

462.40 467.09 B: yeah the big big forums and they had it posted on there it sounded fun and 

464.18 464.83 A: yeah and 

467.74 468.59 A: yeah i really 

467.83 468.81 B: something different 

468.85 471.36 A: i really like doing the surveys because um

480.22 482.04 A: put my input and 

482.45 488.69 A: you know if a new product comes and it has something incorporated that i suggested that makes me feel good 

488.46 492.00 B: oh i know it or something that's just awful you know like oh 

489.91 490.17 A: eh 

491.44 491.92 A: yeah

498.19 498.96 A: yeah 

500.76 504.69 A: and then and then plus occasionally you get cash incentive and that's really cool

506.14 507.03 A: yeah 

506.68 518.31 B: you know it's just kind of fun and interesting and you know you talk to other people and not to many people do it or know about it and they are like amazed at what you can do and you know what's going on in different parts of the world 

509.13 509.71 A: yeah 

518.62 519.23 A: yeah
