54.68 63.95 A: right i i know i find that generally uh the people that i've spoken to about it um are not in support of of us going to war again 

63.69 64.28 B: right 

72.10 80.28 A: a lot of middle eastern countries and and people because of nine eleven um you might think that people would be a little bit more behind him 

80.45 83.48 B: i think that's probably the reason they're not because 

80.79 82.02 A: um (( )) 

83.59 89.60 B: they're more focused on them they feel like that's the more important thing to worry about and that saddam is more like just a pain instead of 

89.97 90.74 A: right 

89.97 92.98 B: somebody that might come and crash into one of our towers or something 

92.41 98.25 A: well um right and retaliation do you think that people are very concerned about some sort of retaliation too 

97.31 100.97 B: no -cause i think they almost think saddam's an idiot or something you know 

100.78 102.80 A: i i don't know 

102.94 104.12 A: i i would be 

110.91 111.39 A: inspection 

111.49 116.49 A: but you know there's got to be some smoking gun somewhere and they're just not finding anything 

116.82 120.98 B: yeah exactly and then two i almost think that if they're really 

118.14 118.54 A: um 

121.30 123.72 B: worried about nuclear type stuff or whatever 

123.94 125.48 B: that india and 

125.80 128.09 B: who ever it is pakistan are the bigger threat 

128.19 128.56 B: with 

128.99 129.38 A: right 

129.05 136.04 B: nuclear war than anything saddam is going to do -cause if he was going to do anything at least to us or whoever he would have done it by now 

137.29 137.78 B: yeah 

149.54 150.53 A: her feeling was 

151.01 152.70 A: yet she felt like um 

155.35 155.86 B: mhm 

162.91 163.16 A: and it's 

168.25 168.72 B: mhm 

168.64 180.24 A: um across the board from other countries like we normally would have and even look at at england even though their um tony blair supports us the english people absolutely do not support getting into anything 

180.25 183.54 B: yeah and i'm i guess i'm not real sure in general why 

183.95 187.95 B: they don't -cause i know they like you said after nine eleven they were a lot 

188.14 193.41 B: more so but i definitely get the impression this time that everybody's like let it lie or something 

193.48 203.79 A: right well you you know personally the other concern that i have too is um i am worried about what this is going to do to gas prices and things like that are they going to go up 

203.60 208.42 B: maybe that's what other people are concerned about -cause at least around here they're already going up 

221.36 223.33 A: travel the way i normally travel 

222.99 223.56 B: right 

223.54 225.42 A: you know all of our money will have to be toward 

225.58 229.81 A: getting my husband to work and and things like that and and um 

227.34 228.24 B: exactly 

229.24 233.43 B: and that's one of the big things in my mind about him and with the war last time is i'm 

233.57 234.91 B: i think he was the one that just 

235.11 235.60 B: for 

236.19 240.81 B: just for fun i guess set the oil fields or whatever on fire and just wasted all of that 

239.27 239.93 A: mhm 

241.27 245.31 B: oil and and gasoline that was him right during the war last time 

243.19 243.57 A: right 

244.12 244.54 A: right 

244.68 246.56 A: yeah i think in kuwait 

246.44 246.99 B: mhm 

246.83 249.92 A: they they had those sorts of problems you know 

250.06 252.83 A: i i i see too a lot of people are 

252.95 255.25 A: so much more focused on 

256.03 261.67 A: what's happening at home and things that need to be taken care of here and i think it's that way for people in other countries too 

257.93 258.37 B: yeah 

261.42 261.79 B: yeah 

261.81 262.54 A: they're not 

262.91 269.99 A: um they're not nearly as concerned about what is happening in in other places and they want to focus on what's happening here 

270.35 275.14 A: i recognize the over all threat of the instability in that area and how that that does 

273.84 274.39 B: yeah 

275.28 277.24 A: can potentially affect all of us 

276.99 277.54 B: mhm 

277.51 277.96 A: but 

278.73 279.11 A: i'm 

279.22 282.94 A: still um i still would rather not see us go to war i would rather not 

283.05 284.86 A: see um us lose 

285.40 291.78 A: young men and women um you know and and um and the cost of everything 

286.80 287.49 B: right 

291.46 291.97 B: right 

292.31 294.94 A: um and did you see on t._v. uh 

295.16 298.22 A: well i guess it was our local news that was pointing out what 

305.45 306.25 B: oh okay 

320.47 320.97 A: mhm 

320.60 328.80 B: and i think that people are probably associating that with like a vietnam type thing and that's probably scaring a lot of people -cause they're going to lose their young younger kids 

326.29 326.82 A: right 

328.71 331.29 A: well and like me i have an eleven year old son 

337.02 337.49 B: mhm 

341.65 342.36 A: father was in the n- 

346.52 349.36 A: but when i think about you know my eleven year old son i'm like 

349.52 352.68 A: he's not going over to fight in the desert you know 

351.35 353.22 B: exactly exactly 

352.85 354.15 A: so it's it's um 

353.75 361.39 B: and there was a lot of friendly fire stuff so it's almost like out of all the different places we've fought it seems like maybe desert's a little tougher for us to 

361.54 362.82 B: to fight in maybe huh 

362.32 363.83 A: yeah yeah 

363.21 367.20 B: and just not worth it in terms of you know like israel is a lot more of a 

367.87 370.61 B: concern i would think than -cause saddam isn't even 

370.96 373.48 B: i don't think actively threaten- anybody he's just 

373.86 376.13 B: trying to take over everything or something 

376.14 376.59 A: right 

376.41 380.70 B: you know it's not like the israelis that are killing each other daily in the uh 

376.72 377.08 A: right 

380.99 384.53 B: and who ever it is i'm i'm getting mixed up as to whoever israel fights with but 

385.00 386.98 B: they're s- killing each other every day 

386.59 388.19 A: right right that whole gaza 

388.27 390.94 A: strip area and the fight over the land and everything 

388.55 389.41 B: exactly 

390.22 390.97 B: exactly 

391.11 392.97 B: and that's the same people that were involved 

393.40 394.15 B: over here 

394.66 401.61 B: with um bombing us so i think even there people are more concerned with that than again saddam he's just almost like 

394.84 395.22 A: right 

401.75 408.77 B: you know he got his chest puffed out or something and you know i got a hundred percent of the vote and everybody loves me here you know or something and you know 

403.93 404.38 A: right 

407.43 408.26 A: yeah 

408.36 408.77 A: well 

408.96 413.20 A: yeah what do say that that the people are more frightened of him than they are of us 

413.79 414.40 A: um 

414.30 414.94 B: mhm 

414.72 415.37 A: and and 

415.97 416.77 A: you know 

423.27 423.96 B: mhm 

425.70 426.23 B: yeah 

428.83 429.26 B: yeah 

428.98 430.78 A: the way we do things are right and and 

432.67 433.33 A: for 

433.74 436.05 A: you know thousands of years 

436.10 436.65 B: mhm 

436.40 443.21 A: a certain way doesn't mean that our way really is right you know perhaps they're happy the way they are and they don't really want to be rescued from him 

438.74 439.43 B: that's right 

440.84 441.12 B: yeah 

442.70 443.27 B: that's true 

443.32 448.34 A: the the trouble comes in when he does try to to step into other countries and 

447.90 448.40 B: mhm 

448.80 451.84 A: and do things in other countries but i i wish i 

461.39 464.16 A: through the c._i._a. or whatever intelligence report 

465.14 470.22 A: why oh i i think we better pull it out better show people um 

468.01 468.52 B: mhm 

470.72 478.96 A: because uh obviously they're not finding anything either that or he's got stuff so well hidden and and i don't know if he's smart enough to do that you know 

475.34 476.11 B: exactly 

478.66 484.90 B: yeah i don't think he's a bin laden but i think that he's got some decent enough connection that like you said he's 

485.44 489.21 B: he's going to know where to he's had plenty of time to hide it from the inspectors 

489.46 489.93 A: yeah 

490.23 490.72 A: yeah 

491.81 495.25 A: oh i don't know it's it's a really tough situation for all of us 

498.49 501.75 B: kind of like everybody's like well the u._n. wants to handle it and then we keep 

501.88 507.44 B: or bush or whoever keeps trying to wrestle it back and i think that's what's annoying a lot of people too there's no clear cut 

507.84 508.27 A: right 

508.36 509.55 B: you know path for this 

509.64 515.13 A: well there's also no doubt that we're viewed by a lot of of other countries if not most other countries as police 

515.42 515.98 A: in a hooligan 

515.46 517.50 B: i was going to say yeah bullies 

517.46 519.96 A: we're going to impose our will and and 

524.13 528.38 B: like alaska or something i think i keep hearing about we have other places we can go for oil 

528.54 529.08 A: mhm 

528.81 533.74 B: and he's at the moment i don't think he's like killing anybody or something like the israeli 

533.88 536.61 B: you know the gaza strip thing is going through they're all 

537.12 538.53 B: killing each other there 

538.53 539.01 A: right 

538.76 542.88 B: but i don't think that saddam is actually doing anything right now in terms of hurting people he's 

541.63 542.03 A: right 

543.03 545.83 B: he might be suppressing them but i don't think he's hurting them 

553.98 554.66 B: yeah but 

554.80 555.06 B: true 

562.37 562.95 B: mhm 

564.00 565.48 B: mhm exactly 

567.50 569.33 A: back fired on us in the middle east
