20.54 21.23 A: hi shala 

20.64 22.61 B: how are you 

23.15 24.01 A: i'm good 

24.30 28.01 B: okay so i guess our topic is personal habits 

28.02 29.38 A: right exactly 

31.17 32.62 A: so what do you think is worse 

31.26 31.84 B: which would 

32.89 35.07 B: which would you say is the worst 

36.67 39.20 A: um let's see what were they gossiping 

39.30 42.47 B: it was gossiping smoking 

42.83 48.92 B: excessive caffeine excessive drinking overeating and not exercising i think 

49.94 51.16 A: i'd say smoking 

52.33 54.90 B: you would say smoking is the worst 

55.08 55.66 A: yeah 

56.41 56.78 B: eh uh 

56.61 57.12 A: yeah 

58.33 61.10 B: i would say that probably gossiping is the worst 

61.32 62.76 A: oh well that's interesting 

63.38 64.75 B: i would say like 

64.09 64.62 A: well 

64.93 68.24 B: gossiping is more hurtful to other people 

68.75 69.56 A: right 

70.31 70.83 A: right 

72.28 75.42 B: and as a smoker i guess i'm biased 

72.49 73.54 A: well i i i 

75.09 79.61 A: oh yes 

76.39 80.62 B: i suppose i'm a little biased on that one 

80.90 81.49 A: right 

81.77 86.18 A: but i i get your point i mean i think your absolutely right that it is hurtful to other people 

85.01 85.68 B: i just 

86.12 86.58 B: uh 

86.94 89.30 B: i think the other ones you 

89.46 91.72 B: the people around you have more of a choice 

92.59 94.94 B: in whether they'll participate with you 

95.40 96.84 B: does that make sense 

96.67 101.42 A: well it does and it doesn't when that's the thing about smoking is that that 

96.99 98.35 B: whereas goss- 

101.53 103.55 A: you know if people are in the room 

104.01 107.08 A: they're going to s- they're going to breathe the smoke whether they like it or not 

107.23 112.89 B: well but i guess maybe i'm a more courteous smoker i don't necessarily smoke if 

113.20 116.88 B: the people that i'm around don't want me to i'm willing to go outside 

117.58 118.19 A: right 

118.82 121.85 A: yeah that that's more common place now too 

122.38 124.57 A: that people do that in this country anyway 

124.41 127.05 B: (( yeah it is )) i think 

127.61 130.80 B: you know like with over eating like that's something that 

131.33 134.55 B: is the person's prerogative i don't think it's good for them but 

135.50 138.18 B: it's their prerogative it it doesn't bother me 

138.41 139.16 A: right 

139.34 142.29 A: yeah i agree with you same thing with exercising 

141.87 143.41 B: exactly i mean 

143.65 144.48 A: right 

143.68 148.71 B: i don't do either but i mean i exercise and i don't over eat but 

149.30 155.50 B: if i see someone that is or isn't exercising it doesn't necessarily affect my well-being 

155.80 156.32 A: right 

156.58 159.25 A: wh- whereas smoking and gossiping 

159.95 162.22 A: they they can definitely hurt other people 

162.48 163.46 B: agreed 

164.48 166.84 B: i just i think i think that 

167.01 172.05 B: those two are probably the worst i'd say maybe drinking excessively 

173.62 176.13 B: because i know that can hurt the people around you 

176.21 176.86 A: right 

176.57 176.99 B: but 

179.01 185.31 B: because i know like if you have kids and you're an alcoholic it definitely affects them 

185.69 186.28 A: right 

186.55 188.31 B: if you have friends that are 

186.84 187.46 A: absolutely 

188.66 189.12 A: right 

189.54 189.98 A: right 

190.77 192.20 A: yeah i i um 

192.59 193.42 A: yeah it's true 

194.51 196.16 A: my god that's another really bad one 

202.29 204.19 B: there are a lot of drunk drivers 

202.56 203.55 A: if you 

206.12 208.70 A: yeah yeah that's true too 

212.48 217.28 B: so i guess i would say i'm torn on which one's the absolute worse but 

218.07 220.83 B: there are some that are definitely not as bad as others 

221.98 224.51 A: i i i got it i know which one is the worst 

225.53 226.36 A: it's it's 

226.58 228.62 A: gossiping while driving drunk 

228.77 230.01 A: and smoking cigarettes 

231.15 234.33 B: and eating a hamburger at the same time 

236.27 237.61 B: there you go 

236.66 241.56 A: right yeah there you go and never s- 

239.38 241.75 B: that's like that's like the worst ever 

241.79 242.35 A: yeah 

242.55 247.34 A: and never stopping the car and getting out and taking a walk 

245.52 247.74 B: exactly exactly 

248.97 252.68 A: o._k. good we got it 

256.58 261.78 A: oh go the re- really sad thing is there is probably lots of people that do that 

256.80 259.04 B: that's too much 

262.24 267.15 B: i'm sure well i see them everyday i know there are people you know in my work that 

268.13 270.43 B: you know are just like 

270.80 273.50 B: they take the elevator and i work in a two story building 

274.46 275.45 B: it's horrible 

274.47 275.38 A: oh wow 

276.18 280.22 B: it's like i'd rather take the elevator then take you know what twenty five stairs 

276.28 277.12 A: oh 

280.79 281.32 A: yeah 

282.46 283.10 A: yeah 

283.37 286.54 B: probably on their way down to have get a hamburger and have cigarette 

283.78 284.21 A: i don't 

286.73 288.71 A: right and and i mean 

289.00 293.29 A: how do you look at it do you look at oh here's an opportunity to get a little exercise 

293.43 295.45 B: well i mean 

294.01 295.68 A: because that's how i would look at it 

295.76 300.02 B: well i i actually get my exercise at work by doing the stairs 

300.31 301.93 A: yeah that's what i mean yeah 

302.74 304.87 B: that's how i take my breaks at work 

305.43 310.04 B: is do you know couple laps on the stairs and then go have a cigarette 

309.98 315.92 A: oh no 

310.58 314.40 B: which is horrible 

314.59 319.04 B: it is and i know it's horrible but i can't help myself 

321.82 323.08 A: that's funny 

321.95 328.16 B: and the people i walk with thinks it's horrible like they're like that's so bad for your body i can't believe you like 

328.45 332.09 B: work out and smoke practically at the same time 

330.18 330.69 A: right 

333.04 335.19 B: but it's a habit 

333.72 335.10 A: well i 

335.52 339.22 A: yeah sure i i i totally understand i mean i used to smoke cigarettes 

343.96 345.23 A: so you're right 

344.04 348.36 B: like no matter which of those it is it's pretty hard to quit your bad habits 

348.62 352.86 A: it's true what do but i think cigarette smoking would probably be the hardest to quit 

353.00 356.45 B: well i don't know i think overeating is a 

356.77 358.96 B: pretty major problem for some people 

360.15 364.39 B: i think you know their those people that you see on 

360.20 360.84 A: right 

361.32 362.03 A: right 

364.72 370.42 B: you know oprah and richard simmons and doctor phil that are that's their smoking 

370.89 371.37 A: right 

372.15 373.50 B: is overeating 

372.33 373.18 A: right 

373.65 374.20 A: right 

374.62 380.37 A: yeah right and i mean i'm sure for a lot of people who are alcoholics it's hard to quit also 

381.19 383.08 B: yeah although i yeah 

383.40 385.64 B: i think you're probably right on that one too 

386.18 386.60 A: yeah 

387.15 389.68 B: because i imagine that's pretty hard to quit 

389.64 390.20 A: yeah 

390.85 396.60 A: yeah i'm sure i mean i'm sure if somebody's you know really an alcoholic then 

396.72 397.20 A: you know 

397.79 399.38 A: it'd be very difficult for them 

399.83 400.99 B: yeah definitely 

401.83 402.61 B: definitely 

404.19 410.38 B: i think you know out of uh out of the three i think the hardest one to quit though would be 

410.69 416.71 B: either overeating or smoking because it's like with alcohol you just you're not around it 

417.57 418.56 B: to quit 

418.69 419.32 A: right 

419.39 421.78 B: you know you just like distance yourself from it 

422.41 430.25 B: whereas with smoking it's kind of hard to distance yourself from it all together and with overeating you still have to eat 

427.26 427.85 A: right 

430.58 431.19 A: right 

430.91 433.74 B: you can't distance yourself from eating all together 

434.72 437.81 A: right and and whereas you're saying with the alcohol 

438.30 438.98 A: you can 

439.44 441.02 A: pretty much be oblivious to it 

441.16 442.48 A: you can lie to yourself 

441.54 442.00 B: well 

442.85 454.09 B: well yeah well but i mean you know if you go to restaurants where they don't serve alcohol and you don't go to the bar and you don't stop at the liquor store then it's pretty easy to not be around it 

455.93 457.77 A: oh i see what you're saying right 

458.01 459.44 B: you know if y- 

458.44 463.75 A: but i think for somebody who's really an alcoholic they've they've got to have their drink everyday right 

463.91 464.50 A: i means that's why 

464.19 464.83 B: yeah 

464.96 466.38 B: i imagine so 

467.15 468.89 B: i imagine so 

469.06 473.42 B: i personally have never had a problem with alcohol whatsoever 

473.82 476.94 A: yeah me neither i don't i never found it that attractive 

474.87 476.16 B: like i have a 

477.20 480.89 B: i have well i mean i have a drink here and there but it's not 

481.13 484.42 B: like i guess i don't understand the all powering need for it 

485.20 485.68 A: right 

486.38 493.99 B: like i can have a drink and it's fine and it's like o._k. you know it's cool to go and hang out with my friends or whatever but 

486.49 486.94 A: right 

495.42 500.62 B: i don't i don't get the whole i have to have a drink or i'm going to go crazy 

499.10 499.51 A: uh huh 

501.22 504.57 A: so wh- what is it if i may ask what is it for you with smoking 

505.12 506.36 B: um 

506.66 508.77 B: i actually think it's more 

509.53 510.84 B: just um 

511.22 512.78 B: the social part of it 

513.77 519.04 B: you know like all my friends and all my work friends smoke so it's like 

519.73 521.63 B: i feel like when i've tried to quit 

522.18 522.88 B: um 

523.25 526.87 B: i don't see my friends or it's harder to see my friends
