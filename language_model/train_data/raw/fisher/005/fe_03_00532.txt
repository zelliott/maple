52.13 53.01 B: i'd say 

53.44 55.31 B: cigarette smoking and 

55.92 57.67 B: probably drinking drinking is 

58.23 60.82 B: at least i feel a little more serious because you can affect 

61.58 62.94 B: a lot of other people 

63.39 65.27 B: more seriously hum 

65.48 67.31 B: in one instance whereas i mean 

67.61 70.06 B: second hand smoking is still pretty bad but 

70.33 71.89 B: it doesn't really have the 

72.09 74.13 B: negative en- negative effect 

74.77 78.20 B: as immediately as you know if you're drunk driving or 

78.56 81.49 B: getting into fights with other people because you're drunk or 

81.86 83.49 B: doing things because you're 

83.73 84.70 B: uninhibited 

85.01 86.68 B: that you otherwise wouldn't do that 

86.86 88.81 B: either on faith or go against 

90.00 92.65 B: you know the normal moral codes of a situation 

94.34 103.71 A: i'm in total agreement you just huh you just said everything but well the other is that with smoking hum 

104.00 109.24 A: you know it's the second hand smoke that kills me and i have children so i hate 

106.40 106.75 B: mm 

108.56 109.18 B: yeah my 

109.58 109.91 B: i'm s- 

113.74 115.41 A: i don't like that hum 

115.64 118.15 A: you know when you walk outside a mall 

117.80 118.19 B: huh-huh 

118.39 125.20 A: and people smoke and i'm a i used to smoke so it's i'm use to commit this y- 

125.44 131.96 A: first thing they do is like light up so you walk out with your kids and they walk into this wafting odor 

127.20 127.63 B: right 

131.97 132.34 B: mm 

133.27 134.32 A: huh cigarette smoke 

135.11 136.85 A: you know and then they're inhaling it 

136.99 141.04 A: and so i think it's pretty nasty if you smoke i mean i don't care if 

142.02 145.82 A: somebody is pigging out in front of me because you know it doesn't affect me 

145.83 146.18 B: right 

146.86 149.22 B: i mean my my father smokes and 

149.51 155.27 B: i tried i think i was around ten or something like that and i tried to get him to quit and he did for awhile and then 

155.70 161.59 B: he started smoking again and i got like so frustrated with him that i wouldn't talk to him for like a couple months because 

162.10 165.29 B: i d- i don't think i even knew about all the detrimental health 

165.92 168.60 B: risks of of smoking it was just that 

169.65 177.40 B: i i mean i guess i knew it was bad and it took time and money away from you know the rest of the family so it just frustrated me especially when 

177.68 181.40 B: you know he promised me that he would do something and then he couldn't but that was sort of 

181.94 184.80 B: m- my first taste of understanding what 

184.90 186.49 B: what addiction was and 

186.87 191.90 B: now i'm working at a at a hospital in philadelphia in a cancer ward and i see like 

192.31 193.83 B: all the children who have 

194.20 197.72 B: you know all different types of cancer including lung cancer and i just 

198.17 200.27 B: can't imagine why why something 

200.77 201.89 B: so simple to do as 

202.02 203.60 B: not to start smoking 

204.19 205.29 B: (( )) 

204.54 210.63 A: oh it's just you know everyone's standing around and it oh it's you're so cool and 

210.90 215.85 B: my my dad actually started because he was in the navy and ah that was the only way that he could get 

216.25 219.93 B: you know above deck and get a break 

216.43 217.03 A: a break 

218.04 220.67 A: that's what my father said 

224.43 224.81 B: huh huh 

227.09 231.23 A: if you didn't smoke then you had to work straight through but if you smoke 

231.74 232.80 A: then you could take a break 

233.02 238.80 B: i mean i i still see it today in my huh one of my summer jobs i mean people who smoke they got breaks every 

238.96 239.41 B: you know 

239.66 247.59 B: hour or so and they go outside and then they start chain smoking because then their break turns into like a thirty minute lunch period 

246.25 247.81 A: right 

247.73 252.03 B: and a and a they're getting paid for it huh it doesn't really make sense 

253.63 257.65 B: i don't know i huh i mean i think overeating and not exercising are really 

258.50 260.04 B: huh important issues 

260.21 261.06 B: too because 

261.40 268.88 B: i i think a lot of people just overlook what they can do if they just take you know some time out of their day to do some exercising or just eat 

269.19 271.74 B: more moderate portions of something healthier 

272.50 273.21 A: i guess 

272.51 272.84 B: but 

273.38 274.65 B: i mean i i definitely 

274.09 278.93 A: since i i'm really terrible with overeating and exercising 

276.82 277.23 B: huh huh 

278.36 281.06 B: i am too i mean i'm not that great i used to be like 

281.48 284.10 B: really overweight as a kid and then i 

284.25 286.64 B: cut back on my food intake i haven't really 

287.37 290.44 B: been exercising as much as a probably should 

291.00 292.90 B: i mean huh i'm out of shape but 

293.34 296.79 B: you know i'm almost under weight right now so i mean that's not 

297.12 299.05 B: good it's just going to the other 

298.11 299.60 A: why are you under weight 

300.03 301.62 B: i huh i mean i guess 

302.28 310.41 B: well part of it's because i'm in college and i have no money i li- i live on cereal and like microwave pasta for most of my life 

309.77 314.44 A: oh oh 

310.80 313.12 B: but huh huh 

313.95 324.72 B: i ju- i just don't have time for it i mean i w- i wake up in the morning and i don't really feel like eating and i just start working and skip lunch and then get back later and have so much studying to do and 

324.92 325.79 B: have a light dinner 

325.21 327.37 A: doesn't your mommy like send you cookies 

327.44 329.15 B: i wish she did 

329.76 331.28 B: my mom actually hum 

331.70 335.32 B: she's a social worker which got me interested in psychology 

335.66 336.13 B: and that's 

336.36 339.78 B: sort of how i heard about hum this study through the 

340.21 341.39 B: psychology and linguistics 

341.51 342.02 B: department 

342.59 343.31 B: but hum 

343.91 349.80 B: she started out because she was really overweight and she got involved with overeater's anonymous 

350.40 354.07 B: and hum out of that she started into hum 

354.75 360.64 B: huh graduate school and her thesis was on the addiction of ah overeating and food 

361.32 363.13 B: so i i've seen 

363.06 364.27 A: did she have the answer 

364.88 365.72 B: hum 

366.26 368.53 B: not really i mean she 

369.10 374.13 B: she she's for a while i well most of the time when i was growing up she 

374.23 375.31 B: stopped eating sugar 

375.77 378.35 B: and then after she got divorced from my father 

378.71 379.43 B: hum 

379.69 382.56 B: her new partner was eh huh 

382.80 384.75 B: italian and she was a really good chef 

385.26 388.09 B: and huh she made all this food so my mom sort of 

388.58 391.78 B: gained all the weight back again and i mean she seems 

390.52 391.14 A: right 

392.03 395.52 B: happy now i know sometimes she's really upset about her weight 

395.95 397.50 B: i- it's hard for her because she 

397.63 400.68 B: she likes being active and taking hikes and stuff 

401.06 405.99 B: her heart's not what it should be so she gets out of breath easily and has to sit down 

407.24 408.94 B: i huh i don't know 

408.21 410.35 A: so if she's overweight she should be cooking 

410.65 413.07 B: yeah 

411.43 413.75 A: so why isn't she making you the cookies 

414.11 419.13 B: hum she she never was a really good che- good cook unfortunately she 

418.35 418.71 A: oh 

419.84 426.15 B: and i i think that's the problem i mean everybody's so busy right now that they have to head out to mcdonald's or something because 

426.51 427.13 B: (( )) 

427.63 428.68 B: cheap it's easy 

427.85 429.29 A: i did that on the way home 

429.45 429.88 B: yeah 

430.10 431.43 A: not today yesterday 

432.01 437.28 B: there's a mcdonald's right next to my dorm and everybody goes there late night 

437.14 440.21 A: i would totally not want that smell 

439.51 439.92 B: huh huh

441.16 441.57 A: you know 

444.73 447.07 A: w- what's worse than mcdonald's 

447.41 449.96 B: hum well we have like our building was 

450.55 454.66 B: it's a high rise and it was built in the seventies and it was supposed to last thirty years 

455.12 457.09 B: and then they were going to tear it down but 

457.19 459.25 B: they never did i guess because of budgeting 

459.69 462.93 B: and huh i mean like all our pipes and our vents 

463.04 464.24 B: and heating stuff 

464.93 469.34 B: it's really lousy and then we get rats and mice dying in there so that 

469.44 469.85 B: smells

472.87 475.26 A: go to bath and body works put some like 

476.79 479.57 B: i don't know the two smells combining that might make it worse 

479.76 484.37 A: oh my goodness i'm covering my nose like i can smell it 

481.44 481.79 B: yeah 

484.59 486.68 A: oh that's terrible 

485.97 489.96 B: i'm just so glad we pay the big bucks to live in this dorm 

489.48 490.73 A: oh my god 

492.15 493.19 A: that's terrible 

492.99 497.39 B: it got to the point where i just started naming the rats in our building 

497.07 505.74 A: oh my god i have squirrels in my hou- yeah yeah it's not good they're like you know crawling in my attic i have to call 

499.32 500.34 B: really squirrels 

505.87 509.73 A: oh like huh roofers have to call me up 

509.84 514.43 A: then now no one's called me back but we've totally gotten off the subject okay

532.99 534.63 B: oh i'll be fine 

534.88 537.73 A: you need like chocolate chip cookies i make these 

538.11 543.41 A: like these chocolate chip cookies with raisins and then i dip them halfway in chocolate 

539.85 540.24 B: huh huh 

543.42 545.07 B: oh that sounds good 

545.21 548.02 B: sounds like a mrs. fields cookie or something you see at the mall 

548.04 549.05 A: mm 

549.82 550.53 A: that's why 

551.34 557.93 A: i'm fat cause so overeating is really not a priority for me 

557.34 557.70 B: huh huh

569.74 570.45 B: but i mean 

570.82 572.71 B: i don't necessarily think it's something

592.21 594.86 A: that has fat cells floating in it don't you 

595.91 599.39 B: yeah but i mean i- if you keep active and like
