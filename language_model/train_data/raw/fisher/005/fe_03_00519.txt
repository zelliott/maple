5.23 6.83 A: yeah how you doing kathy 

6.22 7.79 B: good how are you today 

7.33 11.54 A: all right what what what do you think on these habits 

8.12 9.19 B: excellent 

11.13 15.44 B: [lipsmack] oh boy what's the worst i would probably have to say smoking 

15.05 16.04 A: (( smoking mhm )) 

15.73 16.98 B: yeah 

16.44 17.42 A: mhm 

16.98 24.07 B: um i think it interferes with other people's space and the rest of them really don't i mean they're all not great habits 

24.04 33.48 B: but smoking um i don't know if you've ever been out on a date with somebody who didn't smoke or did i don't smoke so going out on a date with somebody who does is 

33.68 35.37 B: it's very it's it's 

35.40 40.70 B: it's rough because they you know have the smoke in your face the whole time and [laughter] 

39.76 47.90 A: what what they don't even ask you i thought most people that smoked these days are so uh so hesitant to do something without getting uh permission all up and down the line i 

45.39 52.59 B: [laughter] [laughter] well i guess uh i guess i've been out with some great guys [laughter] 

51.50 54.72 A: guess that that was the first and only date then right 

53.45 55.65 B: (( [laughter] that was it )) 

55.30 57.64 A: aside from their smoking how was they [noise] 

56.45 58.75 B: all finished um [lipsmack] 

58.76 60.35 B: what about you what do you think 

60.06 62.42 A: well i don't know i think uh 

62.46 65.21 A: i think not exercising could be a problem 'cause 

64.42 66.19 B: mm yeah 

65.55 69.75 A: you can get away with a lot of overeating and a lot of smoking and a lot of abusing yourself 

70.12 73.47 A: but if you exercise okay you're probably gonna have some other 

73.54 76.79 A: decent uh decent health habits to help keep you right 

76.72 78.28 B: [noise] yeah that's a good point 

78.53 87.15 B: um i'm an exerciser myself so [cough] i do know what you mean i don't know that i would call that a bad habit though like somebody's personal habits 

80.94 81.97 A: mhm 

86.34 90.18 A: well not exercising is what they listed at the beginning i believe 

89.68 92.11 B: right yes no they definitely did 

92.19 98.52 B: but the only reason i didn't think of that one really is because i don't know that i would call that like a bad personal habit 

97.97 99.14 A: mhm 

98.70 104.69 B: you know that's more of like a personal choice that you make for yourself that that that was my take on it 

102.16 103.16 A: mhm 

104.07 105.22 A: yeah [cough] 

105.26 109.71 A: what what what did you think about is this your first time you've been on a one of these phone calls 

109.14 110.71 B: it is it is 

110.49 112.23 A: yeah it's my first time too 

111.90 113.54 B: is it [laughter] 

112.71 115.87 A: yeah i wonder what they're looking for they're probably recording us and looking for s- 

116.03 121.19 A: i don't know if they're looking for speech patterns or vocabulary or what the heck they're trying to figure out with this thing 

120.60 127.72 B: i think the way we interact is the way that they're they're trying to see when you speak with a stranger how you interact i think 

122.41 123.27 A: (( mm )) 

127.62 131.05 A: i got no problem talking with strangers i go out of my way to talk with strangers 

130.35 133.39 B: [laughter] very friendly

135.63 136.82 B: oh

149.45 151.88 B: she went to college in 

152.32 157.43 B: somewhere down near there 'cause i passed through there when i went to visit her a little while ago 

157.49 160.66 B: i'm sorry i don't remember the name of the town [laughter] 

161.05 164.48 A: it wasn't alexandria 'cause there's no colleges in alexandria [laughter] 

163.43 166.97 B: no no no i passed through alexandria yeah i remember

168.82 170.27 A: (( merrymount )) 

171.20 172.67 A: mhm yeah 

173.47 180.08 A: yeah that's up in that's up in north arlington [mn] right right across the uh [cough] right across on one of the bridges from d._c. so 

179.93 181.08 B: (( oh okay )) 

180.33 182.34 A: yeah that's a pretty high dollar school too 

182.18 192.92 B: yeah well she was very blessed she got a um scholarship to go there so that was the only but then she wound up interning in d._c. not in her field and now she's working 

185.86 187.60 A: (( mm [mn] )) 

192.85 198.65 B: um at like a concert hall so she's not playing she's a little frustrated about the situation [laughter] right now 

197.47 198.47 A: mhm 

198.54 200.93 A: well i guess there's not a huge market for 

201.00 204.02 A: oboe players even though you might be very skilled 

203.28 210.12 B: i know i know i think you have to play with uh it's not really a solo instrument you have to play with a orchestra 

207.54 208.47 A: mhm 

209.73 210.69 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

210.31 217.60 B: which makes it difficult for you to find you know the right orchestra to play with auditions are always tough so [lipsmack] 

218.18 221.99 B: so yeah that's all i have to say about her [laughter] 

220.64 221.40 A: yeah 

221.72 226.12 A: yeah [cough] but uh yeah i think that's uh that's kind of a interesting uh 

226.17 233.18 A: interesting experiment what they doing i hope i hope they would uh be willing to put up whatever their findings are so we can take a look and see what it's about 

231.46 240.38 B: that's what i wanted yeah i hope they do um at least like afterwards tell us what it was about and what they were looking at i would love to hear that stuff 

239.68 240.79 A: mhm 

241.03 243.55 A: are you one of the paid people on this thing 

243.41 248.34 B: i'm not sure i think so i think they mentioned that you get ten dollars a phone call or something

291.09 291.75 A: (( mm ))
