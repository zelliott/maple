163.40 167.10 A: because i like gainesville then i i grew up in saint pedums florida not um 

166.42 166.81 B: mm 

167.78 170.30 A: up there but i was just there this summer and 

172.89 174.66 B: well this is really a small world huh 

174.41 175.68 A: yeah my mom went 

175.81 177.18 A: to my my parents were both 

177.31 178.42 A: from that area 

178.60 180.26 A: i mean they were born and raised there 

180.61 181.23 A: my mom went 

181.33 181.86 A: to um 

182.01 182.81 A: holy family 

183.66 184.09 A: um 

184.21 186.46 A: i guess catholic school for awhile 

185.64 185.99 B: mhm 

187.26 190.33 A: so and when i was up there this summer we went to their church picnic 

191.24 191.63 B: mhm 

191.71 194.85 A: i don't know if you som- familiar with how the church picnics are but 

196.03 199.98 A: it was real eye opening as far as what i consider picnic from a church 

201.90 207.37 B: well let's see we'll check them out on the over eating huh 

205.91 206.90 A: uh-huh 

207.45 209.32 A: well no they drink at the church picnic 

209.44 210.70 B: oh they do 

210.35 211.20 A: yeah 

211.43 212.49 B: oh my goodness 

212.59 213.73 B: that's a surprise 

213.81 214.99 A: i thought so 

215.42 218.82 A: that's what they do there and they gamble 

218.48 223.87 B: well now they have always had bingo and whatever maybe we should add that to our list too 

224.08 224.41 A: ah 

224.20 224.83 B: gossiping 

224.93 227.39 B: gambling i don't think he said gambling 

227.77 228.52 A: no no 

228.95 230.19 A: no it was this other thing 

232.00 236.00 B: well should we decide which of those things is the worst did he tell us 

236.58 239.26 A: i don't know um exactly what 

239.90 240.45 A: um 

241.70 242.59 A: for but um 

243.43 246.68 A: do they come back on the phone or how does that work 

246.45 249.14 B: well it says i think that's a robot 

248.79 249.46 A: right 

249.54 253.89 B: yeah so he he probably not going to come back and tell us how well we did or what 

254.67 257.57 A: so it just records the conversation type deal and then they 

256.33 256.73 B: yes 

257.18 259.64 B: and then they're going to analyze it for something or other 

259.65 260.28 A: uh-huh 

260.97 262.02 A: oh interesting 

262.10 262.46 B: yes 

262.26 264.23 A: yeah i just checked my email like 

264.37 266.13 A: i don't know about an hour or so ago 

266.60 267.67 A: and um 

268.01 269.52 A: then i didn't um 

270.57 271.27 A: i um 

272.64 273.03 A: i guess 

273.42 276.48 A: when the phone just rang did it took take a long time for you to 

276.62 277.94 A: for someone to answer it 

278.25 280.85 A: or do you have a caller i._d. and you it was them coming or 

280.64 282.39 B: no i don't have caller i._d. 

282.39 283.33 A: yeah me neither 

283.26 283.79 B: yeah 

284.35 284.64 B: and 

284.41 286.75 A: so it take a long time for them to get on the phone 

286.94 288.21 B: it seemed like it did 

288.69 292.88 A: like there was nobody there and i just i don't know why i just held i'm like hello hello hello 

292.44 294.74 B: i kept saying hello hello and then when he 

294.93 297.70 B: and he came on and then it sounded like he started 

297.81 300.58 B: like kind of in the middle like i didn't get the very beginning 

300.79 304.91 A: yeah it was just kind of weird like this is the university of pennsylvania or i don't know what they said it was 

303.88 305.37 B: or whatever yes 

305.53 309.77 A: and so i'm like i know because i could have imagined anyone else in my family would have hung up the phone 

310.60 312.68 A: but i was i remembered my pin number 

312.98 313.67 B: (( )) good 

313.89 315.95 A: i thought so 

314.74 316.33 B: i had to go find mine 

317.06 323.65 A: yeah i i just had been at the computer thank goodness because i wouldn't have had any idea this was going on 

323.69 325.04 B: well i think it's interesting 

325.37 328.33 B: that we both agreed that smoking is not good 

328.42 332.99 B: since floride is just passing these anti smoking laws for the restaurants and things 

332.66 336.96 A: right right does that incorporate bars also 

336.77 338.23 B: yeah it has something to do 

338.48 340.82 B: if it's a free standing bar 

341.49 345.53 B: like if it's a bar all by itself that it's main thing is not selling food 

345.39 345.89 A: right 

346.17 347.85 B: then they don't have to i think 

347.95 348.37 A: hmm 

348.82 352.46 A: yeah i was wondering about that um because because my friend and i went out the other night 

352.64 354.03 A: to the ale house and there was 

354.59 355.05 A: um 

355.60 358.79 A: she thought that once that passed that they would have a hard time because 

358.91 362.57 A: like half of the bar is smoking and half wasn't or restaurant rather 

362.47 362.84 B: mhm 

363.84 366.26 A: and yeah but um i think that 

366.71 371.96 A: the bar situation now i i was thinking more like as as a person you have an option of going in there 

372.10 372.91 A: if you want but 

373.28 373.69 A: um 

374.00 376.31 A: if you work there you're just exposed 

376.48 376.79 B: yeah 

377.22 377.59 A: and that 

377.83 379.53 A: kind of on the sad part you know 

380.06 381.91 B: like airline stewardesses used to 

382.31 383.41 B: get all sorts of stuff 

383.85 384.48 A: like what 

384.76 385.96 B: airline stewardesses 

385.46 386.49 A: right right 

386.60 390.24 B: when they use to smoke on the airplanes they were always coming down with things 

388.02 388.62 A: yeah that's 

390.25 399.23 A: that's true i guess anybody just healthy can do it do too because of the airline i just couldn't imagine taking a flight just sitting there smoking the whole time could you 

399.22 400.53 B: well i used to 

400.34 401.51 A: oh uh-huh 

401.31 401.78 B: yeah 

401.87 402.56 A: yeah 

402.23 404.55 B: i'm a little older i think then you are 

404.46 406.68 A: ah i mean i was on planes um 

407.15 410.27 A: and i guess maybe that would have happened but i don't know 

411.83 412.88 A: but so now i think that 

412.97 417.50 A: pretty bad i guess people can do what they want but not in my face 

416.98 417.94 B: mhm mhm 

417.89 420.47 A: definitely not in my home and i guess um 

420.84 421.26 A: yeah 

422.08 422.47 A: i guess 

423.22 423.83 A: around them 

424.17 427.53 B: or one of the penalties of course for not exercising is that 

427.65 431.39 B: you know it increases the cost in our health care and things like that 

431.27 431.90 A: uh-huh 

431.72 432.82 B: and we all pay for that 

432.96 433.40 A: yeah 

434.90 435.27 A: well that 

434.97 435.29 B: so 

435.40 435.76 A: true 

435.85 436.51 B: we have to 

436.68 438.10 B: to get after the people who 

438.47 439.94 B: who don't do some of those things 

440.98 447.20 A: yeah i think it's pretty important um to stay healthy and it probably helps in a lot of aspects of your life as far as 

447.52 449.82 A: stress or whatever you go through during the day 

450.59 452.26 B: and we pass laws about 

452.54 454.86 B: driving while under the influence and 

456.24 460.66 B: and they just the judge threw out that lawsuit today about that guy that was suing mcdonalds 

460.89 462.01 B: did you hear about that one 

461.68 462.36 A: uh-huh 

462.28 464.14 B: yeah he the judge threw it out 

464.17 466.62 A: oh he did well how smart 

464.99 465.45 B: yes 

466.88 467.44 A: you know 

468.59 469.17 A: don't you think 

469.33 470.50 B: yeah well i certainly do 

471.19 474.00 A: i know it's just like do people really not 

474.16 475.10 A: get it i mean 

475.78 478.60 B: well no one wants to take personal responsibility 

478.80 479.37 A: mhm 

480.47 485.18 A: yeah i think so to and um although i'm not really in favor in limited um 

486.22 487.17 A: ah awards 

487.41 488.04 A: granted by 

495.47 496.24 A: very small 

497.22 498.84 A: judgment a court settlement 

498.98 505.08 A: is not you know it's just like a big slap on the wrist and not hitting the company hard but for something like that i think it is kind of ridiculous 

501.92 502.17 B: yep 

505.32 505.58 B: yes 

508.18 510.88 B: so we covered about everything except gossiping 

510.92 511.52 A: uh-huh 

513.55 514.00 A: um 

514.30 518.63 A: well people do it and sometimes you're at the butt of it and sometimes you are the one doing it 

519.36 522.84 B: yeah i listened to d._r. laura the other day and there were a couple of people on and 

523.25 525.45 B: and i thought you know if if you just 

525.81 528.55 B: didn't tell anybody but you're husband it wouldn't have gotten around 

528.89 529.58 A: uh-huh 

532.38 536.39 A: but i mean people you know if they can um i don't know sometimes 

536.68 539.87 A: you feel like maybe you are at the center of the gossip 

540.03 540.44 B: mhm 

540.70 545.15 A: when that people actually talk about you and it's like i guess it doesn't really bother me that much 

543.05 543.41 B: mhm 

545.59 547.53 A: it's like a just like um 

548.09 549.12 A: i mean i'm not a real 

549.23 551.20 A: gossiper and don't spread 

552.09 556.69 A: rumors and anything but if i have an opinion about something or somebody i will let 

553.52 553.85 B: right 

558.12 559.81 A: my friends or other people 

560.33 561.21 B: yes yes 

560.82 564.19 A: that might not necessarily be gossip it's more like what i 

564.30 565.63 A: feel like and i guess that's just 

566.28 568.12 A: i guess that's what i'm saying people talk about you but 

568.74 569.00 A: friend 

569.12 570.13 A: the actual word 

570.26 573.64 A: gossip that has a connotation is you heard it from somebody else and it 

573.80 575.17 A: not really the right scoop 

575.53 576.41 A: right 

576.12 576.39 B: yes 

577.34 581.10 B: yeah i i think gossip is something that you don't know is based in fact 

581.76 582.42 A: uh-huh 

583.20 589.12 B: somebody says they think that somebody might be something or rather and then you pass it on and so it's true 

589.50 593.85 A: yeah no actually i don't probably don't partake in that that much because i probably have 

593.99 596.13 A: stronger opinions or feelings about things 

596.20 596.72 B: hm yes 

596.25 596.70 A: that's 

597.02 598.60 A: that i would think that would be
