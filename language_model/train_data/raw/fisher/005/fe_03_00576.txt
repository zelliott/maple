79.23 81.54 B: any of the versions of survivor

98.16 99.90 A: popular i 

100.78 103.53 A: think it's because they can relate i guess or 

102.87 103.97 B: could be 

103.61 106.74 A: or somebody's being dirty or [sigh] scheming or something 

106.37 107.52 B: yeah 

107.55 115.62 B: exactly i guess the only ones i've kinda watched and used to kinda watch and enjoy [sigh] you know when they used to have some of the the cop type ones 

115.51 123.37 B: you know they'd actually go along with the cops out on and do their drug busts and [sigh] that kinda stuff some of those were kinda kinda interesting but 

115.64 116.71 A: yeah

147.24 149.28 A: atlanta's bad [laughter] 

149.26 156.54 B: [sigh] yeah i i think think it's pretty much [sigh] pretty much universal any more it's you know i think it used to be the cops were respected and [sigh]

166.44 173.98 B: yeah [lipsmack] yeah i tell you i think i don't think i'd have the patience to to be a cop with some of the stuff they have to put up with and 

174.89 177.12 A: no me either i couldn't do it

183.77 186.83 A: yeah there's a lot of 'em down here in atlanta [sigh] 

187.98 197.13 B: i've i've i've often wondered about some of those [sigh] chase scenes though if they're if they're real or if they're staged for the the t._v. cameras 'cause some of 'em just [sigh] 

197.24 200.58 B: seem almost more like a like a movie than you know than 

199.39 200.90 A: yeah they do 

201.01 203.01 A: makes you wonder some times 

202.33 203.46 B: uh-huh 

206.24 211.82 A: in fact i was driving one day and one of the cops were chasing somebody who was driving all over 

211.65 213.20 B: [sigh] oh my [laughter] 

212.63 218.12 A: [laughter] [sigh] but that's the only one i've ever you know that mm yeah some of them you it makes you wonder if they're staged 

218.39 223.53 B: yep [sigh] that's kind of scary when you're out there driving and they're yeah they're [laughter] chasing somebody [laughter] [laughter] 

221.88 223.10 A: (( [laughter] [lipsmack] )) 

224.70 226.40 A: what time is it there

241.41 248.61 B: i just [sigh] oh [sigh] normally not so bad but boy th- th- this this winter we've had some [sigh] some really cold weather in fact i guess we 

249.71 256.70 B: [sigh] like last you know last night [sigh] it got down below zero i think it's the first fist time this year that we've been below zero and [sigh] 

256.83 261.22 B: it's weird 'cause it seemed like a a week ago we were in the [sigh] in the [sigh] 

261.36 270.08 B: sixties and [sigh] you know this week it's been cold and i guess we're talking [sigh] by monday we're supposed to back up in the fifties again but 

269.48 273.25 A: this weather has been crazy all over the country 

271.63 278.46 B: [laughter] yes [laughter] yes that that that's what you do is have a reality show about people coping with the weather 

276.59 277.27 A: (( [laughter] )) 

277.86 283.64 A: yeah [sigh] it's even uh it's even been cold down here for this part it's not usually this cold 

284.52 299.31 B: yeah 'cause i guess yeah i guess on the news last night they were talking that [sigh] they said the only two states that that uh [sigh] weren't below freezing or uh were uh [mn] hawaii and and uh florida [sigh] like man forty eight states below freezing that's 

295.88 296.84 A: yeah 

298.75 301.52 A: i know that's unusual usually 

302.95 311.83 B: exactly i guess you know you think uh i guess we always think of like you know georgia and down there you know as being nice and warm [sigh] you don't think of it getting cold down there [laughter] 

309.27 310.08 A: (( mm )) 

311.21 317.93 A: [laughter] i think it was like [sigh] twenty something this afternoon and then it's down 

316.16 317.12 B: ooh 

317.87 326.31 A: it doesn't really bug me because i lived in colorado and new york and some places boston it doesn't bug me too much but since i've been down here i guess it does now 

326.53 334.09 B: [sigh] [lipsmack] yes i guess 'cause i think of the the high humidity and [sigh] then it gets cold like that and [laughter] it seems a person would really feel it 

331.91 333.06 A: (( [sigh] well )) 

334.08 340.64 A: it gets hot down here during the summer but the last couple of summers have been cooler for atlanta [lipsmack] [sigh] unbelievable 

340.51 341.37 B: yes 

342.75 346.37 B: [sigh] [laughter] yeah i remember when they had the olympics down there and uh 

346.74 350.30 B: didn't have water fountains at the olympics you had to buy bottled water 

349.78 350.78 A: (( mm ))

366.82 367.63 A: (( [sigh] oh )) 

367.33 379.23 B: [lipsmack] yeah my daughter was down there ooh i think [sigh] three three years ago they had [sigh] had an international uh lutheran lutheran youth gathering down there 

379.34 387.76 B: so she went and and she she's a coke collector so she got to go to the big coke museum down there and she was pretty pretty thrilled with that 

385.45 386.33 A: mm 

389.30 393.04 B: yeah in fact i remember i guess guess the year when i was down there that was when they were 

393.17 396.61 B: [sigh] were first bringing out [sigh] cherry coke and 

396.21 397.25 A: [laughter] 

396.82 410.46 B: [sigh] and [sigh] they had it on all the machines down there and i tried one and thought wow this is good stuff and they said yeah that was apparently that was one of the test markets to you know see how it went over and it wasn't long after that that it went nationwide and turned out to be a big 

410.55 412.68 B: [sigh] big seller for coke but 

412.36 413.17 A: mm 

414.96 417.00 B: (( [sigh] so how long are we supposed to keep talking ))

449.66 451.82 B: [laughter] [sigh] yeah 'cause i used used to have a 

452.29 457.44 B: have one of those used to come on here like like every [sigh] every night after the news it was called cops 

457.34 458.63 A: mhm 

457.96 459.92 B: and seemed like they had a little bit of 

459.93 464.00 B: everything they'd have you know like the drug enforcement officers you know with their 

464.07 467.98 B: their battering rams you know and break down a door you know get in on a 

468.21 470.89 B: on the [sigh] drug people and they'd [sigh] 

471.21 475.28 B: all i guess there were all different kinds of arrests and stuff and 

474.82 475.83 A: yeah 

475.47 483.75 B: [lipsmack] some of it you really kind of felt sorry for the for the people and like like and i watched an episode one night [lipsmack] the poor guy was [sigh] was so 

484.16 486.97 B: just drunk so bombed out of his mind [sigh] 

486.95 490.66 B: that uh he couldn't even stand up couldn't hardly even 

490.62 504.68 B: even talk and [sigh] you know here they were drunk you know he was [laughter] he was driving [laughter] you know and so they busted him and you know the cops were not you know just real happy with him being in that state and being out there in a car and [laughter] 

496.02 497.16 A: [laughter] 

503.67 504.62 A: [laughter] 

504.71 508.98 B: i say yes i am glad i'm [laughter] i'm not out on the same road with that joker but 

508.34 509.34 A: [laughter] 

509.08 513.07 B: but still you kind of felt sorry for him because the guy was so pathetic that just [sigh] 

512.71 513.95 A: yeah 

516.58 519.58 A: and yeah atlanta's usually on 'em too [laughter] [laughter] 

519.14 519.93 B: (( [laughter] [sigh] [laughter] )) 

521.12 523.86 B: oh heck the other reality shows i guess [sigh] 

524.35 526.86 B: well how was that one they had that one that was [sigh] didn't 

526.99 529.39 B: they have one on a cruise ship or something 

529.24 532.75 A: [lipsmack] [lipsmack] oh yeah i think i remember that though i can't remember 

531.77 540.82 B: like i've seen seen commercials for it and [sigh] i think we've had what survivor one two and i don't know what version of survivor [sigh] they're up to by now 

539.45 546.44 A: oh i think they've had three or four i don't know this is too long to watch they had that big brother i never really watched it either 

546.88 553.90 B: [sigh] [lipsmack] and then that and now it's only they're advertising one now uh it's a celebrity survivor apparently they got [sigh] a bunch uh 

552.43 553.30 A: mm 

553.96 555.02 B: of uh [sigh] 

555.86 558.03 B: t._v. or movie stars or something that they're 

558.80 561.56 B: [sigh] throwing out on an island to see how they do 

561.18 563.88 A: that one could actually be interesting maybe 

563.07 564.46 B: [laughter] 

563.89 567.96 A: seeing how long they last i'd probably get bored with it after a couple of shows but 

567.24 568.67 B: (( [sigh] yeah [laughter] [sigh] [laughter] )) 

568.08 571.24 A: that one might actually be [laughter] worth it 

571.42 581.82 B: yeah 'cause i guess actually the closest thing that some kind of reality shows that it was kind of fun to watch was you know who wants to be a millionaire that's kind of fun but i don't know if they consider that a reality show or not 

579.21 580.16 A: yeah 

581.73 586.42 A: [sigh] i haven't seen that come on lately except during the day time the daily one now 

586.29 591.52 B: [sigh] that's right they are having the who's who's the hostess they've got on that too she she seems like she was pretty nice 

591.97 596.23 A: oh i can't think of her name meredith no i can't think what her name is 

595.98 599.89 B: yeah i know she she it seems like she does a really good job of you know kind of get-
