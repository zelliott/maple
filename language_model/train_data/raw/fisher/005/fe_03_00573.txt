119.96 120.36 A: right 

121.10 126.47 A: i think one of the things they want to know is why what is it about it that uh appeals to you 

127.02 131.00 B: like for fear factors i think it's like it's interesting you know because like 

131.77 138.06 B: especially the part where you eat the funny stuff yeah i like to watch that because like

138.81 139.16 B: like 

139.72 141.11 B: it's like uh

146.00 148.50 B: being told to eat this food like it's so funny 

148.68 149.13 A: hmm 

148.83 150.65 B: like the way they act the way they eat 

151.48 152.16 B: yeah

156.79 158.13 B: and the food is yeah 

159.65 160.67 A: go ahead you were saying 

160.97 164.01 B: yeah and the food is so gross yeah but and they still eat it 

164.98 166.14 B: it's so gross you know 

166.20 166.74 A: mhm 

166.59 169.22 B: it's a it's disgusting and they still eat it yeah

172.71 173.08 A: huh 

173.85 177.59 A: uh funny do you think you'd ever like to be a contestant on one of those shows no 

176.09 176.72 B: no 

176.87 180.52 B: no i don't think so but who wants to be a millionaire i would like to be if 

178.13 178.45 A: no 

180.76 181.20 A: mhm 

180.76 181.40 B: i could 

181.57 182.04 A: mhm 

182.05 182.63 B: yeah 

184.74 185.32 B: yeah 

187.25 187.82 B: okay 

188.61 192.72 A: here's my for what it's worse here's my opinion about reality shows 

193.40 197.72 A: such as survivor or big brother or the stuff like this is just my 

197.87 200.96 A: uninformed impression not having watched too many of them 

202.57 203.92 A: they hand pick 

204.83 206.97 A: a group of people from among 

207.31 211.49 A: probably hundreds of thousands of applicants right they hand pick them 

209.97 210.37 B: yeah 

212.49 213.46 A: i'm betting 

213.92 215.56 A: that they don't pick very many 

215.76 216.59 A: ugly people 

217.03 217.46 B: hmm 

217.50 221.26 A: i'm betting that ninety nine percent of the people they 

222.10 224.45 A: pick are young and good looking 

224.74 225.18 B: yeah 

225.48 226.06 A: okay 

226.60 230.48 A: they throw them in to a very staged situation 

230.99 235.41 A: where they know that certain things are going to happen that they have planned out for them 

235.72 236.17 B: yeah 

235.79 239.62 A: they put t._v. cameras on them twenty four hours a day 

239.75 240.23 B: wow 

241.35 243.05 A: and then they call that reality 

245.17 248.72 A: i i kind of have a problem with calling that reality 

259.59 263.66 A: the environment and everything is so you know so planned out 

263.40 263.89 B: yeah 

263.84 271.26 A: and obviously they pick the contestants for certain qualities i mean if they took people totally at random if they just said 

272.04 272.44 A: you know 

272.63 280.13 A: apply to be on a reality show we'll hold a lottery and we'll just pick people completely at random then i might buy it a little bit more 

279.94 282.98 B: oh okay i understand i un- understand your point 

282.75 283.20 A: yeah 

283.26 283.78 B: yeah 

289.69 300.53 A: ratings and people like to look at good looking people instead a ugly people and they probably pick them for certain personality traits to and stuff i i jus- i just have a hard time calling that reality you know what i mean 

293.29 293.90 B: yeah 

300.52 301.06 B: yeah 

302.11 303.53 B: yeah i understand what you're talking about 

303.64 306.64 A: but you know they're very popular nevertheless i guess 

322.74 323.21 B: yeah 

323.73 328.05 A: you know where some of the other ones are almost more like soap operas you know they're like on going 

328.58 329.00 B: yeah 

330.20 337.62 B: you know fear a thing about fear factor is that i don't like is that like it's not fair for man and women to do the same thing i think just men 

337.87 338.86 B: i tend to be more of 

339.10 341.42 B: physical stronger i think 

342.13 353.16 A: that's true but you know they also say that and i don't know you know i don't know much about the kind of stunts outside of eating gross stuff like you say i don't know what other kind of stunts they do on that show but 

342.14 342.84 B: yeah 

351.76 352.23 B: yeah 

353.65 361.68 A: what you say is true that they're physically stronger but it's also i think been brought out that women can like endure pain longer 

361.91 362.49 B: oh 

363.01 366.46 A: you know over a period of time they they adjust to pain 

366.64 370.24 A: better than men do and i guess maybe the best proof of that is the fact that women 

370.51 371.79 A: are pregnant for nine months 

372.42 373.06 B: yeah 

372.80 379.23 A: i mean did you ever think about that if we as guys had to carry children to term the entire human race would die off 

379.55 381.33 A: because we're wimps we could never do it 

382.24 384.51 A: i don't think we could stand the the physical 

385.04 394.81 A: stress of carrying a baby around for nine months but that is kind of off subject but uh you know that is that is just one of the things i think they find out is that uh 

394.48 395.09 B: yeah 

395.42 398.97 A: you know the woman can uh en- endure the pain just a little bit better 

399.22 403.37 A: have you ever watched the uh you know and i'm relying on you for information because i don't 

403.60 407.42 A: i don't watch these shows have you watched any of these ones where they try to 

409.30 413.79 A: marry somebody off you know like the bachelor bachelorette shows have you ever seen those 

414.16 416.70 B: mhm do you consider like blind date something like that 

416.09 419.29 A: well that would be another one that would be kind of like that yeah 

418.71 421.79 B: yeah i watch blind date and fifth the fifth wheel 

422.38 424.49 B: and what's the other one that i watch mm 

425.47 426.29 B: elimidate 

426.57 427.87 B: yeah something like that 

427.55 428.07 A: hmm 

428.28 430.19 B: i didn't watch the one that you said marry 

430.38 432.12 B: oh oh yeah i watched it like 

432.81 439.73 B: no no no i i didn't watch it the one that i watch was that like there is four guys or four women oh no four guys they went to like 

440.22 442.04 B: they went to to a girl's home 

442.21 443.50 B: and and then they 

442.29 442.64 A: mhm 

444.37 446.96 B: and then they stay there and live with their parents and then 

446.26 451.54 A: oh yeah meet the parents or something like that i saw like i saw like two minutes of that 

448.80 449.93 B: yeah (( )) like that 

451.68 455.84 A: just again walking past the t._v. just the other night within the past few nights 

456.67 457.73 A: and they were uh 

458.42 461.74 A: they found out that the one girl had had done 

462.31 473.18 A: something bad in the past and so they like kind of (( )) and then she was crying about it like you know oh gee-whiz because i did this now i don't have a chance and that is that is like all i saw of it but 

473.12 473.90 B: mmm 

473.76 476.72 A: it just se- they just se- seemed kind of goofy to me 

478.50 479.63 B: yeah 

479.50 480.18 A: i think 

479.80 482.77 B: but i like watching i think it's like is the the fifth wheel 

483.56 484.81 B: that's the one that i like most 

484.60 486.78 A: i'm not familiar with that what was that about 

486.51 494.59 B: it's like there is two guys and two girls and then they they will be paired up they will spend some time together and then in the middle of the show like there is there will 

494.74 500.29 B: there will be another guy or another girl who ca- who's going to come and then and then they're going to like 

498.07 498.45 A: mhm 

501.05 502.78 B: there going to choose again all over again 

503.60 504.58 B: do you kind of und- 

503.91 507.42 A: so they given the person another choice besides the ones that they've been with 

507.36 507.93 B: yeah 

508.24 508.91 A: and i do 

508.26 512.72 B: then the funny thing is that there is going to be one girl who is going to be left out 

512.90 514.48 B: or one guy is going to be left out 

512.94 513.35 A: mhm 

514.66 515.13 A: mhm 

515.24 515.81 B: yeah 

529.82 533.49 A: i mean normally we don't get a chance to see like stuff like this going on right 

530.36 530.80 B: yeah 

533.44 533.88 B: yeah 

534.13 536.71 A: so maybe that is part of the appeal that uh people 

537.61 539.98 A: enjoy seeing that sort of thing 

540.10 540.66 B: yeah 

540.81 542.04 A: and uh i don't know 

541.66 543.72 B: then this is what i think so yeah

553.01 553.53 B: oh 

554.39 554.95 B: oh 

563.48 564.09 B: mm
