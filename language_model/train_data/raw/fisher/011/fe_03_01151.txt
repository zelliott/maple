0.59 1.88 B: hi 

2.08 3.71 A: hi i'm mike 

3.42 4.80 B: oh i'm laurie 

4.94 5.95 A: how are you 

5.52 7.30 B: good good [laughter] 

7.03 9.86 A: that's kind of a weird question though [laughter] 

8.47 14.33 B: [laughter] yeah i was thinking it was going to be something real controversial or something like that 

13.14 18.02 A: yeah i just i i just ah found this on on the internet last night but 

16.81 18.24 B: yeah 

18.04 19.04 A: (( ah )) 

19.08 21.68 A: it's definitely a weird question though i mean 

21.47 22.89 B: yeah it is 

22.34 25.03 A: because it's not possible but [laughter] 

25.06 27.12 A: it'd be decent if it was 

26.69 33.04 B: yeah well that's funny because um lately i've kind of had all this um 

33.06 37.80 B: upheaval i'm forty three so it's like i'm going through this looking back and 

37.71 50.27 B: you know regrets and how i might have done more personal things different but i think you know right off the top of my head i think the first thing i thought of was that you know i went to college right after highschool 

50.16 56.76 B: i didn't have a clue of what i wanted to do and i hadn't had any life experience i mean i considered 

56.77 67.19 B: you know it was like a prison to be in school as long as i had so i wish that i had travelled you know gone to europe gone all over the place and seen different cultures 

67.10 77.73 B: and really experienced life and known a little bit more before i went in for four more years you [laughter] so that would be probably my answer on that [laughter] oh right 

77.22 84.48 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah i'm thirty i kinda had the same problem i ah i mean i own a business now and everything in indiana but ah 

82.03 82.92 B: mhm 

83.11 84.13 B: really 

84.69 90.66 A: i'm one of the youngest business owners around but ar- around here and i opened when i was twenty three 

88.14 88.99 B: (( mhm wow )) 

91.35 103.88 A: when i got out of college but there's a lot of things i'd change if i could go back in time i mean there's a lot of things i would've did differently it would have been a lot easier to get you know everything going the way it is now 

103.51 104.56 B: mhm 

104.30 114.99 A: and there's a lot of different ways you know i could've went around a lot of stuff but i did the same thing went to college and took four year- i didn't go back for four more but [laughter] 

113.88 115.03 B: mhm [laughter] 

115.17 116.33 A: (( but ah )) 

116.51 120.71 A: i went into hotel restaurant management and food service sanitation 

118.45 119.33 B: mhm 

121.03 134.33 A: and there was a lot of different things like i say that i wish i would have done that i'd like to go back and do but like i said it's basically it'd be impossible to do it unless they invent something soon [laughter] 

131.70 132.39 B: mhm 

133.69 134.88 B: yeah 

134.24 137.09 A: which i don't see it happening but 

135.61 146.85 B: [laughter] yeah that's i know it's tough because you know you you don't always have the opportunity once i mean you get presented with something um you know when you're young 

146.76 160.60 B: and you don't always get the chance to change that or sometimes you know well for me and my parents financed most of it so you have that feeling that if you don't take advantage of it at that point you might not be able to 

160.55 169.97 B: get it again [laughter] so that's when you look back at the reasons and the choices you made there was always that something was pressuring or whatever so it's 

168.57 169.20 A: (( [noise] )) 

170.02 176.78 B: it isn't always as um logical especially at that age that than it is years' later 

176.80 179.20 B: so i don't know maybe um 

179.78 189.31 B: i mean maybe not everything you did you if you did have a chance to go back it would be even as good as it turned out now so it's hard to say really 

189.48 194.44 A: yeah it is definitely hard to say like i said my my parents were divorced when i was young 

194.61 202.41 A: and so when i was twelve years old i started mowing grass and ah i was making four hundred dollars a week by the time i was thirteen 

197.74 198.83 B: mhm 

202.13 203.10 B: wow 

203.31 204.83 A: and so i just 

204.84 207.92 A: kept all the money in the bank and paid for my own college 

208.24 219.17 A: and everything and then ah like i said i bought my own restaurant and now i have two restaurants a seventeen unit motel and i'm getting ready to open a dollar store so 

218.16 219.07 B: (( [laughter] wow )) 

219.53 221.10 B: that's great 

220.54 221.44 A: (( but ah it )) 

221.74 225.98 A: is definitely different so really if i c- even if i could go back in time i don't know 

226.13 233.06 A: i mean a- i would have liked if i could go back in time i'd like to have changed it and made it a lot easier than it was when i was younger but 

232.28 233.08 B: mhm 

233.07 236.82 A: then you got to look to it like i said what i have now versus then i mean 

237.38 243.04 A: if i would have had it real easy i may have got lazy and not had what i have today either so 

242.85 246.55 B: yeah yeah that's that's a possibility yeah 

246.56 248.88 A: that would have made a big difference [laughter] 

247.86 249.78 B: yeah um 

249.93 260.02 B: yeah it's good that you were able to um you know pay for a lot of that yourself because i think not having that on me made me drift i really didn't 

257.11 257.78 A: [noise] 

259.92 270.02 B: know what to do in college and i just i thought well this is pretty good you know my dad's paying for this and that's not a good thing i think it's better if you really have the 

260.25 261.79 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

267.50 268.54 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

269.93 277.29 B: you know you're in control so i wish that maybe he had actually just lied and said well you know i don't really have that much 

277.27 290.30 B: you know to give you and then i would have really focused in on what i wanted to do 'cause i've often thought i should've been an entrepreneur you know like you 'cause i i ended up majoring in psychology and it has taken me on just the most 

280.43 281.92 A: (( [noise] )) 

290.47 297.12 B: ridiculous floundering journey so that was that was definitely a mistake in in what i ended up doing 

293.91 295.22 A: (( [mn] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

296.97 306.54 B: because it hasn't been i haven't been able to use it to the point where you know it's a professional career or you 'cause you have to go on and get your masters to do anything with it 

306.55 307.66 B: so 

307.03 308.85 A: well you still could though 

308.45 320.77 B: yeah i could if i was motivated and that's the thing not too many people you hear about it at forty three they go back some get their phd but it's really hard it's something about getting out of that 

315.27 316.54 A: [noise] [noise] 

317.03 318.31 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

320.71 329.16 B: um mode of um you know going to school every day and that kind of thing but um you know aside from that i think 

329.67 342.31 B: ah if i could go back and do it all again i might have [sigh] i might have treated my personal relationships different too i ended up um getting married and getting divorced in like six years no children which was good 

342.16 355.13 B: but i you know think my choices of people were really bad too so [laughter] when i w- [laughter] that's another thing you know how easy it is now to look back and say boy i should have not have done 

347.08 348.70 A: [noise] [noise] [laughter] 

355.16 360.22 B: some of the stuff i did you know just i was callous with certain people that i just thought 

360.02 370.29 B: you know w- i just couldn't figure them out and now i look back and i think they were just very shy people and i just treated it like you know i just didn't have the patience for these guys 

370.12 383.91 B: and so that's a deep regret because i don't even know where they are and they seem like they would have been good people instead i chose somebody who who was this i mean he wasn't a bad person but he just didn't meet my emotional needs very well 

383.87 398.52 B: so that was a big mistake too so you know now i'm alone and it's kind of sad if i could do it over again i would've wished i read books or learned more about how to you know to judge people's character better and this kind of thing [laughter] 

393.68 394.68 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

396.02 396.61 A: (( [noise] )) 

397.90 401.10 A: yeah i ah i just got married last year 

400.61 401.50 B: oh 

401.62 406.12 A: and if i could go back in time i would have changed that and made it a lot sooner 

405.31 406.46 B: really 

406.31 407.59 A: because 

407.50 409.58 A: i've been through you know 

409.39 415.29 A: the different girls and all this good stuff and i you know i i just had to be the person that was the football player in 

415.30 427.49 A: you know in highschool and the football player in college and all this good stuff and i met a girl when i was fifteen years old that i was dating and then ah she'd moved away 

427.89 430.77 A: and i hadn't seen her in fifteen years 

430.32 431.48 B: (( wow [laughter] )) 

431.50 437.62 A: and then ah last year i got a phone call at my restaurant someone wanting to know if it was me that owned it 

436.78 438.06 B: oh 

437.65 442.41 A: and i married her [laughter] it was the same girl that i had known 

439.12 441.52 B: (( wow that is so cute [laughter] )) 

442.52 444.94 A: when we were fifteen years old 

445.23 457.55 A: and she had she had seen mike's family restaurant and she said you always said you were going to do it and the only person who i could think of around here that would have a re- have a restaurant named you know mike's family restaurant and she said i knew it had to be you 

457.74 460.48 B: (( wow [laughter] wow that's great wow [laughter] )) 

458.66 459.74 A: and so 

460.01 468.14 A: after fifteen years like i said if i could go back in time i would've i would've changed that you know a long time before now but ah 

468.70 473.47 A: we have ah looks like we have three little kids and i've got a i've got a five month old son now 

474.39 478.74 A: and ah but like i said i would've it would've changed that a lot you know a lot sooner 

478.46 479.75 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

479.22 484.83 A: if i coulda went back in time and did it but ah at the time i wasn't thinking about it you know 

485.40 487.11 A: i was fifteen 

486.73 488.12 B: yeah 

487.76 489.69 A: that's the way it works but ah 

488.76 498.43 B: that's a great story but you know what you might not have had the appreciation of her so you were yeah older to have realised what you almost lost so that's good 

492.81 495.15 A: yeah yeah 

497.83 509.94 A: yeah that's that made a big difference but like i said it definitely you know it's definitely not easy i mean i can make a lot of things easy namely if i could go back in time if i could go back to like nineteen fifty 

499.42 500.66 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

509.32 510.68 B: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

510.19 516.03 A: with the things i know now and and and all the you know all the new innovations of today 

515.56 516.70 B: mhm 

516.25 529.76 A: i could be bill gates you could be anybody you wanted to be with the stuff you know today i mean you could be the richest person in the fifties if you could you know just the simple things i mean like you know i mean satellite t._v. 

520.16 521.59 B: [laughter] yeah 

522.84 523.91 B: right 

529.14 530.18 B: mhm 

529.85 532.04 A: you know cordless phones 

531.24 532.66 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

532.06 533.60 A: or computers 

533.82 537.55 A: you you could be you could be anybody you wanted to be 

537.98 540.99 A: with just the knowledge of what's going on today 

540.43 541.45 B: right 

541.63 543.82 A: that'd be a that'd be a big difference 

542.22 542.87 B: (( right )) 

543.18 545.16 B: yeah that would be that that 

544.55 558.06 A: i mean yeah i'd like to have two hundred million dollars like bill gates or five hundred million [laughter] i mean i and i don't know if i would or not because i mean actually with that you know you pay a price for that too you can't go anywhere you can't do anything 

547.28 548.24 B: (( would be mhm [laughter] )) 

551.56 552.76 B: mhm 

555.29 556.02 B: yeah 

556.95 558.92 B: yeah that's right 

558.03 569.75 A: but ah that's a problem because y- like the rock stars you go out and get mobbed and you know they can't go anywhere can't do anything because they're so famous [laughter] can't take their kids out and do anything or 

566.49 568.15 B: yeah and they're but 

569.13 570.69 B: right right 

570.83 571.81 A: but ah 

571.43 578.14 B: and it's always that security you know that that you're worried that somebody's stalking you or whatever so yeah it's a 

576.77 589.55 A: [noise] yeah constantly having to have body guards and you know security systems on everything and yeah that that would get a little bit there's a lot of stuff you could do i mean like i said if you could go back 

579.16 580.52 B: yeah 

582.16 584.01 B: right yeah 

584.97 586.54 B: yeah 

589.41 590.43 B: mhm 

589.49 592.55 A: you know year's like i said if you could go back fifty years 

592.38 593.48 B: yeah 

592.85 598.03 A: with everything we know now you could you could be like i said you could be anything you wanted to be 

597.58 599.89 B: yeah it's amazing how that would 

599.30 599.89 A: yeah
