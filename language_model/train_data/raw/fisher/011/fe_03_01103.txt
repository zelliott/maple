152.84 153.77 A: (( right )) 

155.52 157.87 A: and how about things like um 

158.60 159.63 A: um 

161.33 163.68 A: what it is the one with with the 

164.09 166.53 A: interior decorator stuff ah 

168.11 182.95 A: i thought about pampered chef too but that even to me it's expensive and like he said in there it asks you wha- if you had um any all the money i still there's jobs out there i don't think i would pay that kind of money to start the business that's out there there's a lot that 

182.87 187.07 A: they seem to be charging a lot of money and then you're are you sure you're going to even 

187.82 191.06 A: r- you know reclaim back your money that you've spent 

190.17 195.48 B: yeah i i always thought it'd be nice either to have a bookstore or a restaurant 

195.58 201.30 A: right i don't want a restaurant because then you've got so much to i thought about a bookstore because i get books 

201.38 204.73 A: and sell them back for half price of what i paid for 

204.34 205.29 B: mhm 

205.52 208.89 B: yeah i have enough books in the house to probably start a store 

208.50 210.40 A: them so we could start a 

209.21 212.69 B: [laughter] but i don't want to give them up they're like my children 

212.84 223.18 A: [laughter] well i figure he my husband reads i read and my husband reads and i'm not i don't usually read a book again or i don't watch a movie again 

223.49 235.90 A: unless it's a i give in to him and go i've already seen this but i don't very seldom do i read a book again so i wouldn't be too worried about selling them although some of them are danielle steele my daughter says no don't 

235.74 236.74 B: [laughter] 

237.88 242.10 B: well i always thought that one thing's that missing in bookstores is 

237.97 238.86 A: (( sell those )) 

242.44 244.24 B: book cases i have 

244.31 248.11 B: i'm out of bookcases i don't have places to put all these books 

244.53 245.51 A: [laughter] 

247.74 249.79 A: (( right that's a thought )) 

248.47 258.26 B: and i think a combination bookstore and a furniture store that has bookcases you know all different kinds would be a great combination 

254.79 255.95 A: right 

258.52 261.52 A: there's something oh there's something else that i thought of as 

261.63 264.61 A: that it needed to be with it and i can't remember [mn] 

265.59 270.50 A: i mean they sell coff- you can get coffee at a bookstore you know if you go 

269.58 270.65 B: mhm 

270.58 273.50 A: i mean to barnes and noble 

273.83 280.61 A: but and that is an idea a bookcase [laughter] so you get your husband to build the bookcases and you sell the books 

280.35 282.75 B: oh no he's not handy 

282.39 284.45 A: no [laughter] 

283.49 285.39 B: but you know you could ah 

285.41 289.64 B: find companies that build bookcases and and char- you know 

287.84 288.79 A: (( right )) 

289.74 298.03 B: have your books on the bookcases in the stores and you know show people that they're they can also buy these bookcases 

297.41 299.07 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

299.41 300.74 A: yeah 

300.46 307.39 B: and i have allergies and i'm allergic to dust so what i want are bookcases with doors 

303.90 304.74 A: oh 

307.49 308.63 A: right 

308.00 309.73 B: because so the books aren't 

309.92 314.25 B: open and collecting dust it's just in an enclosed bookcase 

311.46 312.36 A: right 

314.09 315.01 A: right 

316.63 318.45 A: hm that's a thought 

318.69 320.33 A: (( but then you you know i )) 

321.88 324.56 A: don't know you could make money on that yeah 

324.33 338.24 B: yeah i think so i mean i've there was a used bookstore here a long time ago in where i live and they also sold the bookcases that they had but it was just the one kind somebody made them for them 

325.20 326.30 A: (( yeah )) 

331.08 332.07 A: yeah 

336.56 337.24 A: (( oh ))

431.04 435.99 A: if i could refurbish the building i could open up the front back up 

436.23 440.49 A: and use it as a bookstore or a place to sell 

440.72 442.63 A: a product 

443.11 452.69 A: but i don't want to have to work if i'm doing that if i'm going to a shop you know own my own business and i have a shop i don't want to have to go everyday
