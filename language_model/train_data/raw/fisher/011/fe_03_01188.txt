6.98 7.75 A: oh would you 

8.10 12.17 A: if an unknown benefactor offered you a million dollars to not talk to your best friend would you do it 

12.90 14.94 B: think i would lie about who my best friend was 

15.01 16.53 A: that is a good idea 

17.36 22.50 B: uh that is just the first thing that popped into my head just say oh sure this guy i absolutely hate 

22.78 25.24 B: best friend in the world known him since i was three you know 

26.90 27.59 A: that is an idea 

27.80 31.41 B: other than that i don't know it would be kind of a tough call 

32.89 36.52 B: but i'm a struggling college student so on the other hand a million dollars would 

32.94 33.22 A: i (( )) 

36.82 38.91 B: ease a lot of pain 

38.96 42.24 A: believe me at all ages a million dollars would ease a lot of pain 

42.45 44.47 B: oh 

44.57 46.09 A: i don't know i don't know 

46.58 53.01 A: i wish i my first thought was well um i'm not sure who i consider my best friend right now so i'm not sure that i would say that 

53.30 56.92 A: because um people i think probably think other people are my best friend so 

56.61 57.56 B: yeah yeah 

57.80 61.37 A: now i i really probably would not give up any of my friends for money a million dollars no 

64.80 65.13 A: (( friend )) 

65.78 67.15 A: friends are more important than money 

66.75 67.26 B: mhm 

68.34 68.82 A: and 

68.95 71.78 A: you'd probably make all kinds of new friends though if you had a million dollars 

71.85 72.55 B: yeah 

72.14 73.75 A: people who really didn't like you though 

72.79 74.64 B: yeah 

76.19 76.56 A: and that 

78.86 82.70 B: yeah that is part of it too i'm i'm off at college right now so 

83.07 88.95 B: it's like my best friend at college is probably my best friend different from at home 

89.28 90.06 B: so 

90.46 94.51 B: the one in college i'll probably not see again after i'm done with college so if they considered that you know 

94.88 99.33 A: that is not true i still con- you know i probably still consider my best friend from college my best friend 

99.84 100.88 A: and even though we har- 

101.03 102.73 A: we don't really see each other that much it's 

102.60 103.11 B: yeah 

103.20 103.80 B: yeah 

103.62 106.58 A: it is always like it seems like though when i um 

106.76 107.65 A: call her 

107.84 110.76 A: i never have to explain anything she just understands 

110.64 111.26 B: mhm 

110.95 118.67 A: well even my friends that i probably see every day and they know all the circumstances and they are still like and you think this because of why 

118.83 127.21 A: and but my best friend from college like i don't know i've been going through this bad situation and like i called her one day and i'm like can i just come see you and she's like sure and so then 

127.59 129.30 A: i don't know she just seemed to understand well 

130.01 133.64 A: so i guess i would still call her my best friend your college friend can be your best friend 

133.75 134.29 B: mhm 

134.96 136.61 A: yeah but some college friends you don't see 

137.90 138.37 A: it is 

138.82 139.68 A: like the time 

140.05 141.40 A: after you kind of grows out of it 

141.61 142.13 B: mhm 

142.41 144.68 A: but i guess the thing is if you gave up 

144.87 146.83 A: a mil- you know if you took a million dollars and not 

147.04 150.71 A: talked to your best friend if she really was your best friend wouldn't they talk to you 

151.65 152.81 B: that is it too like 

153.11 157.39 B: you could just say that you are going to and like figure out a way you know 

157.10 158.92 A: i think you are deceptive 

166.39 169.48 B: i i'd be i would definitely try and figure out a way to try and have both 

169.62 171.01 B: is definitely 

171.87 173.48 B: it's like yes i would agree to it 

173.60 177.23 B: but if they are anonymous how well do they know me you know 

177.99 184.04 B: you know what i mean -cause there there it said it was an anonymous benefactor so if they don't know 

184.95 186.28 B: who it is you know and if 

186.55 188.82 B: if they don't know me as well as you know 

189.26 193.72 A: yeah well that is another whole aspect of who is it and what do they expect from you in return 

191.72 192.21 B: mhm 

193.75 194.86 B: yeah yeah 

194.62 195.64 A: like have they ever um 

196.52 198.35 A: read or seen great expectations 

198.60 200.05 B: yes yes 

199.60 204.57 A: so even though there is a benefactor that doesn't mean that some day they won't come back and 

204.69 206.00 A: expect something from you 

207.55 211.42 A: so maybe that would be our problem not giving up our best friend but what is the 

213.26 214.08 A: benefactor 

213.94 219.81 B: well yeah too like if there was other stipulations you have to give up your best friend but 

220.63 228.76 B: you know in the process you're you also have to move or you have to i don't know i think i would more easily give up that than like have to 

229.70 232.64 B: give up some part of myself you know like if they said 

234.13 236.15 B: i don't know give up something that 

240.17 240.59 B: give up 

240.77 243.95 B: acting like your smart or give up acting or like 

244.28 246.75 B: going to work you never have to go to work again well that would 

247.02 247.58 B: drive me nuts 

247.84 248.71 B: you know that would 

248.31 249.00 A: y- really 

249.34 249.84 B: oh yeah 

249.89 253.18 A: most people though if they got the million dollars wouldn't go to work again 

253.47 254.22 B: no 

254.36 256.39 B: if you were told that you can't though 

256.53 257.39 B: you know i mean that is 

256.97 257.55 A: that is true 

257.98 258.82 A: or 

258.31 260.42 B: you got to do something you know 

260.25 260.58 A: right 

261.93 262.36 A: that is true 

262.54 264.05 A: your friends i guess can change but 

264.25 265.12 B: yeah yeah 

265.54 267.25 A: well that goes back to the you know 

267.77 268.59 A: i don't know like 

269.03 271.69 A: when you have brain surgery or whatever they ask you like what 

272.98 275.46 A: um one of my friends told me this that they ask you like what 

275.75 281.16 A: what what sensory would you give up would you rather be able not to see not to remember or not to 

282.59 283.50 A: not to hear 

283.70 286.22 B: yeah i have a friend of mine actually right now that 

286.65 289.14 B: he has got a golf ball size tumor in his brain 

289.90 293.74 B: and they said would you rather have this and have seizures for the rest of your life 

294.56 295.17 B: or 

295.52 298.94 B: do you want us to try and take it out and have a fifty fifty shot that you are blind 

299.78 301.40 B: and he is going in to 

301.68 301.93 B: like 

302.04 303.22 B: chemistry and 

303.52 306.24 B: technology and stuff where he needs to be able to see 

306.58 307.00 A: mhm 

307.01 309.93 B: so he at twenty years old had to make that decision and 

309.81 310.22 A: wow 

310.68 314.35 B: what was more important to him and ach i can't even imagine you know 

315.17 316.91 A: but the seizures won't kill him or anything 

317.37 318.17 B: they could 

318.50 319.04 A: they could 

319.04 325.91 B: they could they probably wouldn't now but if if the tumor gets bigger or something like that and that is the other thing too is the tumor could get bigger 

326.20 326.60 A: right 

326.54 328.45 B: and knock out his 

328.74 331.64 B: sight anyway and by that time it might not be able to be re- 

332.13 333.93 B: repaired or taken out or whatever 

335.52 337.67 A: girl i know she had this tumor and it was 

338.05 341.01 A: it was really far up front they pulled it out through her nose it was really cool 

341.83 343.81 B: (( )) 

350.87 354.38 A: scar and all she had was this little tiny thing and they pulled it out through her nose 

354.54 357.12 B: can you imagine the technology like 

357.20 357.73 A: yeah 

357.25 359.33 B: oh my god how uh 

359.46 363.19 B: how many times did they try that and mess up 

362.08 363.00 A: i know 

364.31 365.07 B: oh funny 

366.80 368.78 A: okay are we up yet 

370.05 370.99 A: have you done this before

471.97 475.35 B: well they kind of picked odd topics too it is not like 

476.62 483.00 B: it is not something that you could i suppose you could have your own opinion on it but it is not something that you would just go oh yeah i talked about this before you know
