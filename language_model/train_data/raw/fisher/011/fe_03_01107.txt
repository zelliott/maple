8.02 21.57 B: i would not have graduated high school early i would have went four years instead of three i would have went straight onto college afterwards and my whole life path would have changed after that 

20.90 30.26 A: [laughter] hi laura my name is chris kelsey um i think i have a similar life path if if i could go back and change it um 

30.68 42.69 A: i did i did three three and a half years of high school but what i would have done was done a little more time got the math and not dodged math the rest of my academic career [laughter] that was 

37.40 39.17 B: (( mhm )) 

39.75 42.54 B: (( mhm [laughter] [laughter] )) 

42.47 46.49 A: so it's not that dissimilar [laughter] 

45.53 51.59 B: well i was really heavy into the sciences and math math i barely made it through 

51.56 61.46 B: it wasn't until i got to college in my twenties when i took my my path off the road and went back to school that i understood algebra 

61.91 65.82 B: oh my god it makes sense now [laughter]

81.86 82.83 B: wow 

82.42 94.49 A: and since i had fulfilled the requirements i quit i started throwing pots and making jewelry in the art department [laughter] then i did my undergraduate work in journalism it required no math 

88.11 89.74 B: oh okay [laughter] 

94.34 95.58 B: right 

94.86 105.40 A: and then last year at the age of not quite fifty i went back to school for a masters in computer science and had to take my first math class since then 

105.60 106.71 B: wow 

106.42 108.33 A: so it it um 

108.83 111.30 A: [lipsmack] it was difficult [laughter]

113.18 116.37 B: when um i went back to the school 

116.40 131.15 B: and then i wasn't really sure if that's what i really wanted to do and at that time you could collect social security until you were like twenty two years old so it was like i was just like looking for a free ride i didn't take anything real seriously um

145.86 148.26 A: [laughter] 

147.30 155.29 B: and you know my geometry and i'm i'm actually just two classes short of my degree 

154.90 156.56 A: congrats 

155.89 161.26 B: thank you however you know i've had cancer a few times over the years and that kind of set me back

161.08 175.27 B: right now i'm taking a break and i plan on enrolling in the fall get those two classes out of the way with but oh yeah my whole life would have been totally different had i just went that extra year 

175.63 183.55 B: you know i mean i didn't have to go i had all my credits but it i could have had a lot more fun [laughter] had 

181.90 186.38 A: yeah and since you didn't you it wasn't like you pushed immediately into your undergrad 

185.81 192.39 B: right i could have taken a bit more classes for fun or more science because i really liked the sciences 

192.46 194.39 B: and just you know 

194.36 202.81 B: been the drone who went to school the four years and you know instead of going off to europe and doing just those things i mean i don't

209.24 210.35 A: yeah 

212.23 222.23 A: yeah see i pushed through and what i i wish i had done apart from you know knowing now that i should like math and it sort of stands between me and all the things that interest me today 

222.00 222.79 B: mhm 

222.27 229.54 A: but i also wish that since since like you i was done early i wish i had been more adamant 

226.85 227.71 B: mhm 

229.69 234.01 A: and and left i i did a half a senior year for half a day 

234.04 243.86 A: and worked the rest of the time i should have been adamant to leave at the end of my junior year and tried to do that traveling because um it it never happened 

235.44 236.28 B: mhm 

243.59 244.64 B: yeah

277.49 279.09 A: oh absolutely 

278.18 289.14 B: and personally you know i kind of like myself [laughter] and you know i'm funny i'm patient i'm tolerant i'm non judgmental 

282.05 283.09 A: (( yeah and )) 

289.02 294.69 B: i can be thrown in a room with a hundred different people not know anybody and leave knowing ninety eight 

293.98 297.47 A: yes i'm exactly the same way and and 

297.64 309.19 A: that part i w- i'm not quite sure how i got that way but i wouldn't trade it for the world because i think we're ahead of you know a whole bunch of people who get up in the morning and don't like who they're living with [sigh] meaning themselves 

302.37 303.28 B: no 

308.47 314.01 B: right or what they see in the mirror and yeah no i mean so

318.15 321.00 B: and and knowing what i know today [mn] 

321.48 327.02 B: and doing and knowing it then instead of being young and stupid and flippant about things 

327.09 333.54 A: yeah but if you weren't young and stupid you wouldn't have done the travels and you wouldn't have the same perspective that you have because of that you know [noise] 

327.45 328.52 B: okay 

333.62 335.90 B: it's true it's really true 

334.39 335.42 A: yeah
