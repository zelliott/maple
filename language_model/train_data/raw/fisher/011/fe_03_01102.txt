1.82 2.91 A: hello 

2.01 4.52 B: this is this is brad 

4.46 5.91 A: oh this is denise 

5.96 7.66 B: hey denise how are you 

7.47 8.53 A: good how are you 

8.80 13.57 B: good good ah so did it already start 

12.97 16.27 A: i guess so so it's supposed to be about bus- opening a business 

16.13 18.40 B: yeah do you want to start it off 

18.66 19.64 A: um 

20.33 21.95 A: sure [laughter] 

21.44 22.87 B: [laughter] 

22.03 24.55 A: um let's see i've actually ah 

26.04 28.59 A: had a small business with the family before 

28.74 29.85 A: so 

30.35 38.69 A: if i had unlimited funds that would be a wonderful thing because it's definitely ah the old saying of it takes money to make money 

38.67 39.82 B: yeah 

38.72 40.38 A: i think that's [mn] 

40.75 43.43 B: now what kind of business was it 

42.86 44.27 A: it was a um 

44.72 47.10 A: photo development like a one hour 

47.22 48.45 A: photo store 

47.41 48.58 B: oh cool 

49.33 50.54 B: oh okay 

51.78 52.87 A: what about you 

51.81 57.46 B: very cool well ah i guess if i were to start a business 

57.69 65.12 B: ah probably fall somewhere in that actual photography range also ah because i'm an 

65.14 67.38 B: amateur photographer and i 

67.45 74.83 B: think that would be a lot of fun to just help people out with that um not a lot of profit there though 

74.88 76.80 B: um [laughter] 

76.67 82.86 A: that's where where the money ah if you have all the the equipment available to you and um 

83.40 93.28 A: you got to know what kind of what kind of service you want to offer i think if it's going to be custom or just you know the the quick one hour you know here's what you get 

94.00 99.23 B: well yeah i guess i'd go with the ah custom you know have all the higher 

99.68 104.15 B: higher priced brands and all that good stuff you know 

102.14 103.11 A: mhm 

104.64 113.40 B: so well i think i'd do that i never really wanted to start my own business though honestly what about you 

113.36 125.09 A: it after doing it the first time it's a lot especially that type of service it's a lot of work i went through a period as working my full time job going to the store 

126.19 137.38 A: working a couple of hours we'd close for an hour or so go get something to eat and then i was back and i would be there pretty much through the night working on orders and then i'd go home take a shower and go back to work 

137.66 143.80 A: and pretty much did that for almost six months and finally said can't do it anymore 

137.83 138.81 B: gee 

144.06 148.13 A: so again by having unlimited funds where you don't have to worry about 

149.28 158.12 A: if the business is actually making it um to pay your other bills as well would be an advantage it would definitely take the the stress off of 

158.17 160.78 A: the situation and probably make it more enjoyable 

161.39 167.08 B: definitely wow yeah i i was reading up on a study that showed that ah 

167.13 179.01 B: what is it i want to see ninety percent of businesses close their doors after ten years i think like they just don't make it 

179.52 182.33 A: i would believe that i'm surprised it would even be ten years 

182.56 194.59 B: yeah it's it's way up there it's just like you're running a long shot if you start your own business but you know it takes the small businesses to make the bigger ones right [laughter] 

194.11 208.21 A: [mn] right and and that's it there's a lot to invest and i think you have to realise especially if you're coming from working at a at a normal type of job where everything's there already there for you you have to realise that 

206.36 208.12 B: mhm 

208.32 212.20 A: you might have to make some changes in the way you you do your normal 

212.30 218.02 A: everyday routines and you might not be able to have the fastest machines 

217.81 232.02 A: available for you have to slow it down a little bit but um not go out and buy the best of everything to start with until you start getting some money in and and also seeing how it's going to work how what kind of business you're going to be getting in 

232.43 236.11 A: for really what kind of equipment you're going to need to take care of it 

236.66 244.53 B: yeah and i guess you you really got a lot of hard lessons ahead of you when you start a business for the first time 

236.87 237.82 A: so 

243.92 247.42 A: yes yes and a lot of re- and 

244.97 246.35 B: [laughter] 

247.46 252.57 A: it's you just have to i think you have to remember to kind of go slow and not jump in 

252.71 255.31 A: (( not t- absolutely everything )) 

255.43 260.35 A: at one time but if you start off slow then you're going to do better because you can 

261.13 261.86 A: (( [sigh] )) 

262.22 263.27 A: um 

264.33 270.13 A: figure out how to do do that thing and do it do it good and then 

270.22 278.73 A: continue add more more offers out there um you know like your custom work you know if you're going to do color and then 

279.01 291.52 A: so you've got that or maybe you do color on the machine and then you do like custom black and white which is so rare to find and ah and specialize find your w- your speciality that no one else is doing 

286.15 286.95 B: yeah 

291.45 298.24 A: and ah get your business growing that way and that would be a good thing but it just takes ah 

299.10 306.19 A: it takes time and you can't rush it and you can't expect to you can't expect to make money right away either which is i think a big um 

306.62 311.13 A: a big thing that people expect and it's a disappointment to them 

311.93 315.90 B: yeah you're supposed to be in the red for two or three years 

316.22 322.52 B: for sure like just losing money at least for two or three years with every small business 

320.44 321.68 A: i think it's not 

322.41 326.93 A: yeah it's not it's not unexpected to have that happen um 

327.46 328.95 A: it's ah 

329.27 337.63 A: there's just so much cost involved in starting up and especially like a photo type thing your supplies you have to have paper you have to have chemicals 

337.54 344.36 A: and um you've got to figure out where your break even point is and it i think it takes time to figure 

344.39 355.11 A: it's kind of hit and miss you try to figure it all out and and ah what kind of coming up with your pricing and what kind of hours you're going to offer and the whole 

355.07 360.32 A: whole thing plus if you're going to have employees or you're going to do it yourself you know like we did um 

360.68 368.13 A: it's ah there's a lot to it and it's very it can be a very stressful time [laughter] 

367.17 368.30 B: yeah 

368.34 369.73 A: we learned that 

370.10 372.73 B: oh i'm sure i'm sure 

373.35 386.78 B: i don't know i was just thinking like if i if funds were really not an issue i think they're what they're driving towards is what's your dream small business or what would you just love doing and i think i would love to do a ah 

386.90 389.57 B: casino party ah 

389.79 391.15 B: company 

391.53 393.02 A: oh those are very cool 

392.99 394.99 B: i know i i love 

393.23 393.91 A: i 

394.06 402.08 A: i've had those at at company parties we've had those and as part of as part of like the holiday party and that's a fun thing 

397.42 398.62 B: yeah 

402.20 403.26 A: um 

402.49 403.25 B: (( yes )) 

403.74 414.03 A: that would be i think for me it would be my sister in-law's actually a jewelry designer and that's a very tough thing starting out in so if i had unlimited funds i would love to be able to 

414.43 421.71 A: fund her in doing that getting her set up and because the work she does is awesome but 

421.82 435.50 A: you're talking you know platinum and eighteen carat and fine gems and everything and that's expensive and it's it's definitely a high end type of thing and um but knowing the work that she does i'd love to be able to 

435.88 441.21 A: help out with something like that and really get it set up in the right way 

441.58 445.03 B: so you'd be the ah the primary investor then 

441.68 442.73 A: but 

444.93 446.86 A: right right 

445.84 448.79 B: [laughter] th- that's excellent [noise] 

448.47 458.63 A: and um i and i doing some of the business stuff because i don't think she quite has the head for that she's definitely the designer side um but um 

458.88 460.67 A: so i'd be able to kind of 

460.87 468.81 A: just write the checks and and and find the right place for her you know the store to be set up and do that kind of footwork and 

468.84 472.35 A: and as side benefits you get to have trips to italy or 

472.44 473.59 B: ho ho 

473.34 483.28 A: thailand or whatever to on your shopping you know once she goes looking for [laughter] for her jewelry um that would be the the side benefit um but i think that would be 

483.25 490.25 A: would would at this point for me would probably be the thing that i would would like to do i would enjoy that because 

490.30 494.33 A: i've seen her her work and and knowing what she's capable of 

494.70 496.34 A: would be a a fun 

496.83 498.62 A: fun thing for me [laughter] 

498.45 504.90 B: oh that'd be cool and that way you get to explore the marketing sides of it and everything 

499.65 500.37 A: so 

504.29 507.51 A: right right that's a very different um [lipsmack] 

508.39 514.81 A: world from what i'm used to so it's just nothing that i've ever done before and retail is so 

514.86 527.87 A: different and i think high end jewelry is very different because it's it's where most people just go in and see something and say yeah i'll take it it's it's a more emotional purchase and so um 

528.35 530.75 A: it's a a different side for people 

530.77 533.40 B: a lot more personal purchase also 

533.18 534.77 A: yeah yeah 

533.96 544.04 B: like you don't want to go to robinsons may and spend three grand on on a necklace you want it made by somebody that you've made a personal connection with 

543.87 554.82 A: right right and you can see the detail that yeah that's that's that's it and ah but at the same time like your idea on the casino thing that's a a fun 

544.94 547.66 B: at least that's for me yeah 

555.19 559.11 A: [mn] you know fun thing and it's another kind of um 

559.76 571.63 A: people you know because it's not real money and so people just kind of can play and do it's a a fantasy it puts them in a fantasy world which i think everyone needs um 

571.67 572.72 A: these days 

573.04 577.16 B: yeah agreed [laughter] 

575.31 578.32 A: [laughter] so and i'm not sure how much um 

579.88 580.89 B: i'm sorry 

579.89 583.03 A: how much of the i'm not sure how much of a a 

584.24 587.03 A: dollar resource you would need to start something like that 

587.42 599.61 B: well i've i mean i do a annual casino party at my house but it's ah obviously you know just total you know cheap stuff just 

599.00 599.89 A: [laughter]
