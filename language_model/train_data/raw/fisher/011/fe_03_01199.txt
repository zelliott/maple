0.47 1.79 B: (( hello )) 

1.36 2.69 A: hi 

2.51 4.24 B: hi my name is cathy 

3.85 5.09 A: i'm jill 

4.95 6.91 B: well jill what do you think 

6.74 9.51 A: i don't know i wasn't expecting that [laughter] 

8.91 12.55 B: no i know i was expecting them to say something about a rat too so 

12.30 16.06 A: [laughter] that would be appropriate for today right 

12.71 14.71 B: i guess i [laughter] 

14.85 16.89 B: they fooled us ha ha 

16.49 17.68 A: yeah 

17.10 18.95 B: [laughter] 

18.27 20.48 A: it's a it's a hard call 

20.15 22.11 B: yeah it really is isn't it 

22.39 23.19 A: 'cause 

22.96 27.74 B: [mn] because your best friend is your best friend but a l- a a million dollars is a lot of money 

27.46 28.82 A: yeah 

28.21 30.15 B: [laughter] 

30.02 31.99 A: yeah i mean it is it's it 

33.37 37.80 A: maybe you could come across another best friend later [laughter] 

37.22 44.74 B: yeah i suppose for a million dollars you might be able to do that and you know what you might find out that that person really wasn't your best friend 

44.16 45.79 A: hey that's a good point 

45.19 49.78 B: and if that was so then you'd really really be upset with yourself wouldn't ya 

49.11 52.40 A: yeah if you didn't take it yeah well i guess that's the only way you'd find out 

50.52 51.53 B: yeah 

52.00 54.66 B: yeah i i i can't think 

55.14 59.00 B: i don't know i don't know if i could give up a million dollars even for a friend 

59.07 61.77 A: i i would probably have to take it this 

61.81 69.26 B: 'cause i think if it was if the shoe was on the other foot that she would probably do the same thing i would think i mean i would expect her to do that you know 

69.07 73.46 A: yeah yeah i feel like i need to talk to all my friends and just let them know that if this ever happens 

69.27 70.20 B: that's a 

71.53 75.78 B: [laughter] just in case you have a millionaire knocks on your door right 

75.32 77.58 A: right yeah they should take the money 

77.20 78.34 B: really 

78.51 79.60 B: i don't know 

80.26 81.37 B: well i 

82.20 86.80 B: i just think that there's a lot of things that you could do with a million dollars but then on the other hand 

87.02 88.04 B: gee 

88.57 91.76 B: you'd never have you could never speak to that person again so 

92.53 94.57 B: i that is a really hard one 

94.23 98.84 A: i wonder if you can send them letters just explain why you can't speak to them any more 

99.54 108.74 B: oh it didn't say it said you couldn't speak to 'em but that doesn't mean that you couldn't email them or you couldn't like yeah yeah you could email 'em a letter 

102.14 103.31 A: that's right 

105.44 106.87 A: exactly 

109.06 111.68 B: or you could tell somebody else and they could tell 'em 

112.00 114.31 A: if you could just speak through somebody 

112.07 115.43 B: and you and you could give 'em some money and then they probably wouldn't hate you 

114.95 116.64 A: hey you could split it 

116.41 118.91 B: there you go [laughter] 

117.97 120.30 A: that solves everybody's problem [laughter] 

119.09 127.84 B: there you go [laughter] and then you could just always be friends through the email and and just not speak because that was the only thing right just speak 

124.84 125.93 A: that's right 

128.20 131.72 A: and with that much cash you could get a really nice computer so you know 

131.46 133.23 B: yeah no kidding 

133.58 136.80 B: no kidding what would you do with a million dollars 

136.91 138.11 A: i don't know 

138.63 139.79 A: i think uh 

140.34 141.98 A: maybe travel 

142.11 143.36 B: yeah 

143.09 145.21 A: take time off and just 

146.06 149.51 A: just wander around the world a little bit might be kinda fun 

149.14 151.80 B: (( it'd be kinda scary right now )) 

151.08 153.65 A: okay i see there you have a good point 

152.48 159.68 B: [laughter] i guess if we're looking at reality but we're we're not we're not looking at reality because nobody's really give it to us right [laughter] 

155.92 157.94 A: right it's all hypothetical 

158.73 164.64 A: well now now i've got it in the back of my mind you know when is this person gonna call and offer me a million dollars [laughter] 

164.35 172.06 B: [laughter] i guess you must be more i must be more of a realist than you [laughter] i'm probably older than you that's probably why 

168.07 170.35 A: yeah yeah apparently 

171.64 174.85 A: [laughter] well that'll come with time huh 

172.90 175.43 B: but if i did get it huh 

175.12 178.39 A: that'll come with time i'll i'll believe that nobody is ever gonna 

176.49 188.61 B: uh yes that comes with time but that's not what we're supposed to be talking about so um but i think i i think maybe yeah i think maybe we've got it solved i think that would probably work i don't know if i'd give 'em i don't know if i'd give 'em half of it though 

189.21 192.11 A: well some you'd give 'em some decent chunk 

191.46 195.74 B: yeah i mean out of a million dollars you could give 'em just about anything [laughter] and they'd be happy 

195.78 196.66 B: (( you know )) 

196.80 201.95 A: i don't know if my if my best friend got the million bucks you know i'd i'd want at least a hundred thousand 

201.36 202.38 B: yeah 

202.44 205.38 A: otherwise otherwise i think 

204.18 206.35 B: you can never speak to 'em again you know 

205.49 207.99 A: i'd feel a little bit gypped so 

207.49 210.41 B: well probably i suppose 

210.67 211.69 B: (( well )) 

211.72 225.35 B: i suppose if i got it i'd probably feel the same way i don't know i've got a really really good friend but i think she'd probably understand maybe not maybe not at first maybe not at first maybe she'd be really hurt but once she thought about the million dollars 

214.71 215.55 A: yeah 

218.79 219.93 A: probably 

224.70 227.85 A: i mean once you put yourself in the other person's place 

225.29 227.09 B: and then she got the check 

227.18 228.96 B: exactly i mean 

229.04 235.84 B: that's really putting somebody on the spot man i thought we were gonna be talking about something you know in the news [laughter] 

235.61 241.15 A: [mn] well you know that might actually be tougher i suppose you know they don't want any heated political arguments 

241.08 247.81 B: well yeah i wouldn't want to be on the news and give my opinion you know or anything like that just in case they [laughter] tape the clip or something 

247.35 252.94 A: that's right exactly but you know it's fairly comfortable to give your opinion on whether or not you'd take a million bucks 

248.55 249.57 B: [laughter] 

252.43 255.77 B: yeah since it's not gonna happen anyway [laughter] 

253.14 254.21 A: i feel a little 

254.68 258.34 A: yeah i feel a little guilty about about you know my decision to 

258.57 261.66 B: well i don't think i'm gonna call her right up and tell her how 'bout you 

258.93 260.28 A: just sell out 

261.38 262.76 A: no probably not 

262.19 267.02 B: [laughter] now how do we talk about this for ten minutes 

266.68 267.85 A: (( [laughter] i don't know )) 

267.29 272.77 B: i haven't been timing this so i have no idea if they just say beep you're done or what the deal happens have you done this before 

272.40 274.68 A: no this is the first one that's connected 

273.67 279.56 B: oh me too okay well um let's see what else can we talk about with this because we really should stay on the subject 

279.97 281.03 A: well 

280.62 282.01 B: um 

281.89 284.45 A: why is it an anonymous benefactor 

284.87 286.20 A: kind of odd 

285.42 291.56 B: probably because somebody older used to watch the millionaire see and you probably don't even know what that is do ya 

291.10 292.08 A: no 

291.75 304.06 B: well you see there was this guy on t._v. who was a multi multi multi millionaire who would have this guy come knock on the door and would give somebody a million dollars 

303.64 304.88 A: oh wow 

304.54 318.02 B: yeah it was [mn] and then that was the process of it and actually that really probably maybe that doesn't have anything to do with it i don't know [cough] they probably just want to see how long we can talk about this and still talk about the same thing which we haven't actually done [laughter] 

306.29 307.87 A: that's a good show well 

317.37 319.35 A: we haven't been too bad 

318.71 321.03 B: well no we haven't been too bad you're right 

321.15 322.22 B: um 

321.62 323.51 A: we're sticking with money [laughter] 

323.41 326.65 B: yeah i was trying to think of what i would do with it 

326.69 334.82 B: i probably would like uh pay my bills i'd pay my mom's bills and i'd pay my son's bills and my brother's bills yeah that'd be the first thing i'd do 

331.77 333.24 A: well you're nice 

334.90 336.89 B: get rid of the bills first 

335.09 335.65 A: (( [mn] )) 

336.27 338.13 A: paying everybody's bills 

337.58 341.48 B: yeah oh yeah i would do that 'cause i know if they got it they would do that for me 

341.83 343.82 B: family's family you know 

341.86 343.57 A: that's very thoughtful 

344.78 350.18 B: and um i of course would have to give some to my friend [laughter] that i was no longer gonna speak to [laughter] 

349.04 352.94 A: that's right the one you can't speak to but you can buy nice gifts for [laughter] 

352.27 363.38 B: that's true you could like yeah you could hey yeah you instead of splitting the money you could just you know do gifts now that's a good idea that's a super good oh that was good 

358.98 359.96 A: that's right 

362.69 364.86 A: you could pick out thoughtful jewelry 

365.27 368.12 B: oh and she likes that too [laughter] 

366.47 371.32 A: [laughter] well see so it's perfect so your best friend is perfect for this scenario 

368.27 369.62 B: yeah yeah 

370.73 375.23 B: yeah [laughter] how 'bout yours is yours that good 

372.94 374.39 A: she might actually be 

375.14 377.41 A: oh i think she would understand 

375.48 376.68 B: not as good 

376.81 378.17 B: she'd understand 

377.55 379.57 A: i think if i paid off her car 

379.25 382.32 B: well see or you could buy her a new one or something 

379.64 380.98 A: (( [laughter] )) 

381.86 383.05 A: that's right 

382.96 386.00 B: yeah that would be just like change or whatever 

385.67 390.54 A: well i guess that's true it's so funny i guess the whole magnitude would change 

390.06 394.86 B: well and you don't usually think in those terms of a million dollars you know 

394.52 396.21 A: no certainly not 

395.05 400.40 B: um but i think that we're we're supposed to be thinking about our friend here too are 

401.02 406.76 B: you gonna change your mind or are you gonna keep it that way [laughter] i think i'm gonna stay with the million dollars 

406.17 407.76 A: yeah yeah it 

407.00 410.25 B: because there's just too many good things that you could do with it 

409.77 413.57 A: would [mn] yeah and any opportunity is really only gonna come along once 

410.71 411.49 B: and it 

413.05 416.74 B: well yeah if it ever did that would only be one time you're right 

416.95 419.65 B: if it came along twice you'd be really happy 

417.55 419.09 A: that's right i'm i'm going 

420.22 424.36 A: yeah especially if you got it multiple times [laughter] and you had to give up multiple friends 

422.33 429.02 B: yeah that'd be cool wouldn't that be cool yeah [laughter] then all of a sudden you'd have no friends and you'd have lots of money [laughter] 

427.98 432.02 A: i think you have to have a balance 'cause it could be depressing to end up with no friends 

431.41 438.48 B: well i think that would be terribly yeah terribly depressing and since the stipulation was only speak to 

438.68 441.53 B: as long as you didn't speak to 'em you could even be around them 

441.57 445.16 A: that would be tough though i mean can you imagine going to lunch and just 

442.84 454.64 B: yeah it would i mean but you would probably be places where you would see 'em or whatever but if you'd already talked about it like on in emails or whatever i'm just trying to figure out how you can get around this and still get the money you know 

454.25 462.45 A: you could get those cameras for your computer so you can look at each other while you're emailing and it would be almost like being together 

457.66 459.14 B: oh there you go 

460.76 462.65 B: almost like being together 

462.74 463.64 B: yeah 

463.01 468.88 A: but you have to wonder if you get together and you talk does somebody take the money back 'cause then you're gonna have a lot of bills 

469.02 470.76 B: no kidding 

470.92 475.68 B: well they didn't say anything about that they just [laughter] they they 

473.34 476.51 A: [laughter] so now we're trying to figure out how to cheat 

475.99 486.82 B: yeah [laughter] no i'm not cheating i'm just trying to figure out how i don't completely have to like break the friendship i mean they s- they've literally said you just couldn't speak to them ever again 

476.64 479.41 A: i have to wonder if this is typical [laughter] 

486.54 490.82 A: right probably meant more than that but we can take it literally [laughter] 

488.48 490.01 B: well maybe it did 

490.09 493.93 B: that [laughter] i'm very much a literalist too [laughter] 

492.90 496.20 A: that's right well you know if it if it helps you work around something then 

495.13 497.56 B: [laughter] sometimes it does 

496.91 499.35 A: you gotta go for it that's what i say 

498.01 503.07 B: that's right that's right that's right well now that we're both minus one friend 

502.85 504.23 A: i know 

503.74 508.26 B: and we uh both have a million dollars where do you want to go [laughter] 

507.41 510.29 A: well yeah you're right that now is not a good time but 

510.11 510.99 B: no 

511.70 515.50 A: we could just uh rent an r._v. and drive across the country 

514.91 517.55 B: gee that would be really fun i've always wanted to do that 

517.44 518.83 A: (( i think it would be fun )) 

518.10 521.48 B: then you'd ha- then maybe you'd find a new friend [laughter] 

520.60 524.62 A: [laughter] somewhere at a truck stop we could find new friends 

521.62 522.96 B: (( [laughter] oh )) 

523.36 534.43 B: [laughter] no no no no no no no [laughter] no no not at a truck stop i don't know if that's a good place [laughter] maybe you could maybe you had a second friend that was your second best friend or something [laughter] 

525.02 526.57 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

527.29 528.33 A: [laughter] 

533.52 536.19 A: (( that's right that's right they would )) 

535.41 538.46 B: or you could always take your husband or your boyfriend or whatever you know 

538.29 543.30 A: oh yeah i wonder how much of the money my husband would think he gets to spend [laughter] if 

542.70 544.01 B: i don't know 

544.47 549.14 B: well if you're the one that got it i guess it'd be yours you're gonna have to decide if you're gonna share it 

548.85 550.39 A: that's right well 

549.39 552.99 B: i would think that if he's your husband you probably would share it with him though [laughter] 

552.57 556.97 A: i would i would let him have a little bit of a say in the money decisions but 

556.20 557.95 B: yeah well that's good 

557.77 561.75 A: i get to overrule all decisions anyway at least that's what he says [laughter] 

560.27 565.44 B: [laughter] that's what you get for being a wife [laughter] that's because you're a woman 

562.32 563.80 A: that's right [laughter] 

565.53 568.27 A: that's right but i'm not sure what the reason is but i'm 

567.50 573.68 B: i know i know well let's see what else can we talk about as far as this friend thing goes 

574.14 580.03 A: trying to think if i have any friends that's an interesting point if you consider your husband your best friend then it would become tougher 

579.94 584.33 B: oh now that'd be rough because then that would mean you'd have to like live separately 

583.98 589.08 A: yeah i don't know if i to be honest i don't think i could do that i think i'd have to give up the million dollars it 

584.50 586.44 B: or get a divorce or something 

589.27 592.11 B: yeah for that you probably would 

591.50 597.85 A: it's too intertwined but for the best friend and my best friend is not even in the same town so it's really it's an easier problem for me 

597.28 599.25 B: oh that would be easy for you then 

599.50 599.89 A: (( yeah ))
