153.07 154.27 A: yeah 

153.72 154.60 B: oh 

154.40 155.51 A: but i'm like 

155.62 167.10 A: you know even it was like just you know not if they said okay no he is part of your life he is part of your family whatever you know if it was one of my g- one of my female friends or one of my good guy friends 

166.50 166.94 B: right 

167.83 176.11 A: i just don't know if i could do that because so many of my anybody that i really consider a friend to me 

175.96 176.49 B: uh-huh 

176.28 178.06 A: is so ingrained in my life 

178.17 178.77 B: right 

178.18 184.41 A: that they are almost family you know that would be like here is a million dollars to never speak to your mom again 

180.19 180.91 B: right 

184.58 185.18 B: yeah 

185.03 187.17 A: you know i could i couldn't do it 

186.91 192.34 B: yeah i i have one good girlfriend and if they knew it was her i couldn't do it either 

192.53 196.57 B: because we are just really really close we've been friends for a lot a lot of years 

196.37 198.38 A: not that you know 

197.63 198.05 B: so 

198.65 202.13 A: if they didn't know me you know now and you know five years ago 

208.23 209.36 B: oh no 

208.63 214.35 A: you know in that situation yes you know if uh somebody from the past who still thinks we are best friends 

214.52 216.74 A: well hell yeah you know 

215.24 216.04 B: yeah 

216.38 217.93 B: definitely huh 

216.89 221.45 A: but 

219.27 227.92 B: but then see then you can consider those kinds of things too like here uh your best friend did what she did and now you lost out on a million dollars you know 

226.84 227.77 A: mhm 

228.12 228.63 B: so 

228.55 229.37 A: and you know it's 

229.94 241.81 A: or if there was some way of you know you you don't know who this person is so is there some way of screwing the system and you know saying oh yeah this is my best friend some random joe i picked off the street 

236.64 237.09 B: right 

241.91 242.50 B: (( yeah )) 

242.29 244.91 A: yeah i i guess i'm kind of you know 

245.13 248.69 A: i'm broke enough that i've thought of all the possibilities you know of 

248.93 249.75 A: how can you 

250.04 251.04 B: so that (( said )) 

250.63 251.40 A: oh 

251.37 255.82 B: we'll give you a million dollars if you never talk to your husband or fiance again 

255.96 258.01 A: i'd be like sorry you know 

257.46 257.95 B: oh 

258.43 264.40 A: and that's and it kind of scares me that you know i know this so much that 

263.59 263.92 B: right 

264.65 272.33 A: you know because that's honestly you know i've been thinking about this on and off for all afternoon and i'm like 

272.84 277.00 A: that really tells me how much of a commitment i have to him 

277.00 277.45 B: right 

277.68 278.73 B: where are you from 

279.04 281.43 A: i live in wisconsin you sound like you're southern 

280.07 285.78 B: i knew it i knew it i could tell by your voice -cause half my family lives in wisconsin 

288.45 290.29 B: half of my family lives there 

290.89 293.74 B: and um what was your first name 

293.87 294.36 A: val 

308.21 309.09 A: uh-huh 

310.11 316.38 A: yeah but i'm just like you know the more and more like i said the more i thought about it -cause they called earlier 

316.59 318.94 A: this afternoon and the call got screwed up 

319.07 319.53 B: mhm 

320.33 326.46 A: so i ended up calling them and saying um well somebody's voice mail picked up i don't know what happened but we were disconnected 

326.61 327.23 B: oh 

327.37 330.61 A: and so i'm like i've had the chance to think about it and i'm just like 

331.56 332.19 A: that 

332.67 337.95 A: the possibility of that to begin with is just really weird you know some random person 

337.80 340.73 B: yeah says never talk to your best friend again 

338.25 340.10 A: you know you 

340.95 343.27 B: and i'll give you a million dollars wow 

343.38 345.63 A: and like to begin with that's really sick 

345.43 346.42 B: yeah it is 

346.09 347.69 A: you know why would somebody do that 

348.14 350.20 A: and especially you know okay 

349.60 356.99 B: the only way that i could think that someone would do that is if they thought your best friend was bad for you and it was like a family member or somebody that 

356.29 366.95 A: right so if it's your parents and they go never talk to this person again what kind of a person is that anyway that would try to run your life like that 

361.01 361.48 B: right 

366.07 371.60 B: you remember that movie years and years ago with demi moore that they gave her a million dollars 

370.72 372.14 A: indecent proposal 

372.17 372.96 B: yeah 

373.05 375.49 A: yeah for sleeping with that guy or whatever 

373.09 373.94 B: you remember that 

374.48 379.99 B: yeah mhm it would be kind of like that i mean after you got the money then it's all ruined you know it's like 

380.44 381.20 A: mhm 

381.47 382.01 B: so 

386.78 387.25 B: mhm 

392.78 393.40 B: yup 

393.50 395.54 A: i almost might do that 

395.23 398.70 B: right oh 

396.07 406.87 A: you know just just for a one time thing and i can still have my finance well he'll be probably be my husband by that point but i can still have all that 

401.36 401.94 B: right 

403.73 404.27 B: right 

405.75 410.40 B: right but then to never talk to him again that's another situation 

409.58 411.64 A: that's entirely different 

411.59 412.16 B: yeah 

412.26 414.62 A: you know and like i said i've been married before and 

415.74 423.85 A: you don't know if you say never talk to him again with what i know now fine you know but 

419.99 420.51 B: right 

420.94 422.14 B: yeah 

422.63 423.27 B: definitely 

424.57 425.07 B: hm 

424.83 432.76 A: for s- for somebody to try to run your life like that and if it was like say your parents or your sister or whatever if they have that kind of money anyway 

430.44 430.91 B: mhm 

432.47 435.43 B: yeah and then they give you a stipulation like that then 

435.50 441.24 A: you know i just oh i can't i just seriously can not imagine that happening in my life anyway 

441.31 442.03 B: right 

442.96 443.95 B: right well 

450.46 451.14 B: yeah 

451.08 454.36 A: you know if it's somebody that that's important to you 

452.00 452.40 B: yeah 

452.57 454.70 B: money is not worth all of it huh 

455.05 455.98 A: not at all 

456.10 462.32 B: no even those sometimes we're as broke as we get or we want to pay our house off or whatever you know 

459.35 460.43 A: uh-huh 

466.36 466.81 B: right 

468.21 468.92 B: oh wow 

470.09 472.81 A: and n- you know knowing i owe him a thousand bucks 

473.06 473.54 B: uh-huh 

473.37 474.74 A: i wouldn't take it 

474.65 475.40 B: right 

476.05 476.50 B: right 

477.41 480.72 B: yeah i guess um i would say same thing because that's just 

481.79 483.59 B: like i said there's uh you know 

484.05 488.01 B: if it was just uh a friend that i wasn't that that close to 

487.94 488.78 A: mhm 

488.88 491.19 B: maybe but i would still feel you know 

491.19 495.26 A: i'd be guilty but if it was somebody i really wasn't that close to 

492.16 492.70 B: yeah 

495.18 495.68 B: yeah 

496.26 499.77 A: you know then i might i would i would really definitely think about it 

499.83 500.40 B: oh yeah 

500.55 503.22 A: but when they specified best friend 

500.97 501.51 B: yeah 

503.93 506.97 B: i wonder if they ever get anybody that says oh yeah i'd take it 

504.17 504.95 A: yeah 

507.07 508.91 A: i'm sure there's enough shallow people out there 

509.05 510.33 B: yeah i'm sure 

510.64 512.96 B: that's the world has gotten the way that it has huh 

512.55 514.61 A: mhm well and okay so 

515.05 516.77 A: say i'm a single mom 

516.89 517.50 A: and 

517.77 519.08 A: i have two kids 

519.90 520.69 A: and 

521.82 524.16 A: my best friend and i talk all the time 

524.28 526.14 A: and we lean on each other 

526.33 528.36 A: but what could a million dollars do for me 

528.67 529.20 B: right 

529.49 532.65 A: you know then i might really think differently
