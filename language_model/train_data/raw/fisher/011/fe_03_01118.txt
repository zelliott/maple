0.08 3.89 B: hi my na- hi [laughter] my name is edgar wagner 

0.22 1.58 A: (( hi )) 

4.05 6.01 A: hi edgar this is dawn 

5.72 8.69 B: hi dawn [laughter] how are you doing 

8.42 9.73 A: (( good how are you )) 

9.30 13.82 B: i'm doing pretty good this is my first time ever doing this so bear with me 

13.34 15.09 A: same here [laughter] 

14.14 21.55 B: same here okay then um i think the question was if we had an opportunity to go back and change some things 

21.65 26.69 B: and what would we change and and why was that the question 

26.50 30.01 A: yeah and i can't think of anything 

27.88 28.87 B: would 

29.64 32.20 B: well i could think of a lot of things um 

32.38 35.23 B: [laughter] so you want me to go first 

34.84 38.66 A: [laughter] yeah you go first a- actually i can think of something but you go first 

35.86 37.04 B: okay 

38.02 42.63 B: okay i'll go first um i think i would change um 

43.82 47.42 B: my perception of reality um 

47.22 48.25 A: (( [noise] mm )) 

48.56 59.86 B: yeah um as um i guess i could say this without being um bashful or anything i'm a gay individual gay individual i'm black african american 

58.25 59.21 A: okay 

59.97 61.83 B: and um 

62.24 75.46 B: when i was younger i had a lot of problems with the the fact that i was gay ah i didn't realize that it was a problem until i got a lot older and that society viewed it as being you know wrong or 

75.98 84.26 B: demeaning or you know that it was just a abomination to god and all that good stuff and i think i would have changed 

82.11 83.26 A: right 

84.96 92.66 B: my i guess my acceptance or my um understanding of my lifestyle and probably embrace it 

92.76 104.82 B: um and and not give too much weight or too much emphasis on what other people um thought or viewed um but that's just a small aspect of me and i've been dealing with it for many many years 

104.95 114.41 B: um i'd say that's probably about the whole thing i would go back and change other than that my life is good i like the way it i like who i am today i like some of the things that i 

114.44 118.75 B: have done sort of you know to learn how to accept myself but 

118.82 121.04 B: overall i'm pretty much um 

121.54 124.75 B: a happy person okay you go [laughter] mhm 

123.37 124.76 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

124.84 128.92 A: wow well mine's a little bit different i um 

129.05 138.77 A: well i i actually have a couple of things but one the first thing that came to mind that i thought of is i i wouldn't have spent so much on my credit cards that i have to pay down now 

137.16 138.03 B: (( oh )) 

138.49 139.79 B: yes mm 

139.50 142.86 A: i would have thought more or learnt how to 

142.88 150.95 A: listened to myself when i said no you don't need this but bought it anyway basically i think i would have changed that because um things would be a little bit easier now 

150.49 151.60 B: yeah 

151.70 157.77 A: um and the other thing i think i would change is i think i might have listened to my parents when i was younger and um 

156.41 158.77 B: (( oh girl [laughter] )) 

158.65 159.71 A: you know 

159.74 161.67 A: you know i'm i'm overweight 

161.87 166.39 A: by at least sixty pounds and i think i would have listened to them because i was an overweight kid 

166.89 168.13 A: and um 

169.50 173.73 A: you know realized they were trying to help me even if they weren't doing it right 

173.20 174.61 B: (( mm yeah )) 

174.04 177.16 A: so that i didn't have to deal with that because i don't know 

177.19 185.98 A: how it's going to affect my health in the future i mean i seem fine i'm healthy now but that doesn't mean it didn't shorten my life or hurt my heart that i don't know of yet 

185.37 186.56 B: (( yeah mm )) 

186.69 189.73 A: so i think i would change those at least 

190.30 193.78 A: so now if i have a problem i still have credit cards to pay down 

193.50 194.66 B: (( okay )) 

194.42 195.48 A: you know 

195.19 205.88 B: well you brought up two interesting you know topics on me i mean i can i can especially the last one you know my mom and i we don't have a we don't really have a working relationship 

198.93 200.99 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

205.69 207.03 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

206.02 210.72 B: um basically i think what i did was i patterned myself around her 

210.75 213.30 B: whatever she did i w- i'd try to do my 

213.29 215.14 B: darndest to do it twice as 

214.99 228.75 B: twice as better [laughter] um and it caused a problem because there's a friction now but now that i look back on it you know she was telling me not to do the things she was doing because she knew what kind of effect it had had on her life 

220.66 221.68 A: right 

228.79 230.09 A: (( right )) 

228.88 232.44 B: but i wanted you know i guess i was looking for approval 

232.72 237.19 B: and i was looking for acceptance so i thought if i patterned myself 

236.97 241.89 B: you know in her lifestyle you know i- i would be more acceptable 

241.67 255.02 B: and she's like finish school do this stay away from that crowd right there that crowd doesn't mean you any good and i'm like well that's the same crowd you hang around with so why should i listen to you you know saying well now that i'm older now 

247.83 249.09 A: right 

252.82 254.48 A: exactly 

254.82 264.26 B: and i look back on it i think god i should have listened my grandma was trying to tell me to save money not spend on no credit cards buy now pay later thingy 

259.37 260.74 A: [noise] 

264.20 277.66 B: and i figured that that thing i i i'm with you on that one right there if if i guess the older you get for me the older i get is a little more difficult to um save money 

277.64 278.84 A: yeah 

277.65 283.33 B: and and not buy into that buy now and pay later thingy because it's so convenient 

283.65 293.66 B: when you have a credit card in your hand you got no cash you know you need something something from the store you need a new outfit or you you see something that caught your eye on t._v. t._v. is the thing for you 

293.73 298.56 B: it's like go get it you don't got to worry about it for thirty days you know 

293.74 294.64 A: (( uh-huh )) 

298.52 299.86 A: (( right )) 

299.00 301.52 B: and ah all of a sudden you just 

301.54 306.93 B: debt debt debt debt debt and that causes a lot of stress and a lot of anxiety because you like 

305.97 307.15 A: [noise] 

307.10 312.32 B: goh see i need to pay my rent i need to pay my bills too so which one do i pay 

312.80 313.69 B: so 

312.92 323.62 A: exactly and like when i think of what i pay out now on the credit cards for the stuff that i've already used up or you know went to the movies and don't even remember which one i saw 

323.13 324.14 B: mm 

323.80 328.36 A: you know stuff like that or went to a restaurant where i didn't need to buy that or this 

328.46 330.67 A: when i think that i'm paying now 

330.68 336.24 A: all this money that i could be using doing whatever i want with out of my paycheck it kills me 

334.39 335.48 B: (( mm )) 

335.54 338.51 B: yes especially interest 

336.50 338.63 A: but i don't to 

338.60 343.82 A: you know i don't want to go through the bankruptcy thing like that because that throws ten years of even more hardship on you 

343.73 344.85 B: definitely 

343.77 353.73 A: and why do you have ten years of hardship where i wouldn't be making my credit better by paying instead of making it worse by throwing a bankruptcy for five years where nothing changes 

353.42 354.43 B: true 

354.42 356.35 A: (( you know i don't want to )) 

356.23 366.10 B: and no one's going to touch you after for those ten years no one's they's they advertise ah we ignore bankruptcy we ignore repossessions 

366.03 374.84 B: they don't ignore that i've had one car i've had one car repo it's my first car ever i had i was i got it like in two thousand and one i 

367.40 369.04 A: (( no they don't )) 

375.17 379.06 B: had a nice car a ninety eight bueller sabre and um 

377.53 379.07 A: [noise] 

379.50 394.06 B: i got it and didn't know i couldn't pay for it i was working part time and i got a full time job and and i thought i could swing it and i didn't think about the i i well i did include the insurance and all that but i didn't i didn't include the speeding tickets 

393.97 395.74 A: right [laughter] 

394.62 405.67 B: and the fines you know i didn't the parking tickets i didn't include all of that and i got a repo and you know these places say well we don't look at the repo and all yes they do 

405.95 407.62 A: yeah they do that's 

406.79 407.94 B: they do 

407.91 413.09 B: (( they that's the first thing that comes up on my credit report is the repo everything else they're going to be looking at )) 

412.98 427.73 B: and i'm like god if i had listened saved my money bought me a car you know we wouldn't have this problem today but if you live and learn but i am tired of living and learning i want to already have learned you know what i'm saying 

418.94 420.14 A: right 

427.80 432.15 A: exactly and my boyfriend had a repossession from his divorce 

431.72 433.05 B: mhm 

432.39 434.45 A: and you know his credit's 

434.69 435.49 A: (( now )) 

435.88 440.23 A: he's paying you know twenty this or twenty that on um 

440.45 442.79 A: credit cards like percent or whatever 

443.02 446.63 A: and it's like well so am i so why should i go through 

446.94 453.16 A: bankruptcy for all that when i may as well just pay them down and get better interest rates and like look like i'm paying [noise] 

452.37 458.97 B: definitely i think that i think that would be the best the best bet because if you go to bankruptcy unless you got 

459.12 468.02 B: i heard that what you do is this is probably illegal [laughter] once you accumulate everything you're going to get the house the car whatever 

468.56 476.08 B: and then you go bankrupt you know you don't bankrupt not having these things already you know situated ah because 

475.01 477.14 A: that's a good point [laughter] 

476.25 484.97 B: yeah [mn] you don't you know you didn't have a house and a car you know it's like what's the sense of you know saying go bankrupt um because in a long way it's going to hurt you 

485.10 486.23 A: right 

485.71 496.38 B: yeah because no one's going to take no one's going to take a risk with you no bank is willing to take a risk with you unless you put up some money and then it costs to go bankrupt it costs about five hundred dollars just to file for bankruptcy 

496.13 498.89 A: yeah i'd rather pay something with it [laughter] 

498.14 502.08 B: yeah it's not it's not cheap to go bankrupt you've got to have money to go bankrupt 

502.09 511.40 B: so i think that's a good idea just pay what you can pay you know i don't think this how this is supposed to work but [laughter] but yeah i think you're doing a good job 

502.19 503.88 A: mhm 

509.13 511.32 A: yeah 

511.56 513.47 A: yeah no and i just 

513.49 515.63 A: i don't worry about what people think i 

515.97 523.49 A: i drive an old car although it looks nice and i keep it nice but i drive an old car and my insurance is like eighty bucks a month you know it's cheap 

522.48 523.62 B: wow 

523.68 525.95 B: you know you must not be in georgia then 

526.13 529.85 A: no i'm in pennsylvania [laughter]

541.31 546.60 A: oh that's not bad at all see i don't have any of that like collision or anything because it's an old car you know 

542.52 543.48 B: yeah that was 

546.07 548.65 B: (( oh okay you know this is full coverage )) 

547.24 550.14 A: and i got it for free so it's like okay 

549.09 560.75 B: oh wow yeah so you could you could afford to pay eighty dollars for insurance definitely you got the car free so you yeah that's cool i thought we'd been on here for twenty minutes now [laughter] look 

559.76 561.69 A: yeah i wonder do they tell you 

561.34 567.21 B: yes it's supposed to be a um a recording that lets you know your ten minutes are up
