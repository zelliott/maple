48.13 49.23 A: so 

48.98 50.32 B: that's wonderful 

49.86 54.83 A: how would you go about ah opening your own coffee shop if money weren't an issue 

54.54 59.02 B: um well what i would do is i would probably um i'm trying to you know 

58.97 62.72 B: work out details i'm thinking like the future maybe in about ten years 

62.66 66.49 B: um possibly looking at um a good location 

66.37 79.70 B: that would be one and then finding enough square feet and enough ah room obviously for a kitchen and some kind of a you know coffee shop layout where they would have tables and a a coffee bar 

66.38 67.21 A: uh-huh 

79.59 84.99 B: and um maybe help yourself but do the cappuccino and lattes behind the counter 

84.71 85.71 A: uh-huh 

85.24 90.11 B: type of like a starbucks but ah you know a little nicer a little more cosy and ah 

90.15 93.93 B: you know more more like a mom and pop but but not 

94.05 94.97 B: you know 

95.56 97.84 B: that type of thing i like what people w- 

95.63 96.58 A: yeah 

97.72 110.88 B: people will be able to ah kind of meet each other and um you know maybe have a relationships or um just you know have let's go out and have coffee tonight we went to the movies that kind of thing or you know 

109.45 110.29 A: uh-huh 

110.97 113.01 B: so that's what i would like to do 

112.98 117.72 A: good i like i like coffee shops how would you how would you ah decorate it 

113.43 114.29 B: um 

117.23 119.13 B: um probably 

119.00 133.17 B: i don't know i i go back and forth with it probably try like the starbucks type of ah lighting where they they actually have a low lighting type like a low but high it's an odd kind of lighting to get you in the mood to drink coffee 

133.18 141.04 B: um that's how i would do the lighting the inside the core would be small tables enough to sit four and um 

141.23 149.63 B: you know basically um i don't know not square floors just something more cosy um you know light in the decorating not too light 

149.46 150.35 A: uh-huh 

149.91 150.92 B: so 

150.48 153.33 A: would you have any food or internet connections 

153.35 164.99 B: um yes i probably would i would have um no i wouldn't make like dinner any dinner type things but maybe like sandwiches you know already made inside the cou- in the um 

164.86 172.03 B: you know inside the glass case um probably breakfast food ah bars things like that 

171.39 172.31 A: uh-huh 

172.46 175.58 A: would you have like any books or games around 

172.73 173.47 B: so 

174.99 176.12 B: um 

176.23 185.95 B: probably i would actually make it part bookshop that's my whole thing i would really like to have it like a part bookshop where you can actually purchase books and read them 

185.92 192.74 B: um maybe i'm not sure but maybe like a t._v. in the corner ah couches kind of thing you know 

192.45 193.47 A: yeah 

192.86 207.24 B: i would have to really like see the size of the room um and how i'd want to lay things out ah you can't i'm just speculating a lot of ideas going through my head i've i've had this idea for a long time but with two kids going through college and it's not something for right now but it will happen 

207.01 208.01 A: uh-huh 

207.64 209.08 B: so um how about you 

208.83 213.41 A: oh wait one more question do you think do you think you'd be a good business owner 

210.05 211.14 B: oh okay 

212.83 224.48 B: i would be a great business owner i've already had a business i ran out of my house for four years when my kids were little and um it was successful ah except for you know you were tied down to it 

214.21 215.25 A: oh good 

224.37 225.24 A: uh-huh 

224.49 230.87 B: you know i mean it is your life you know the phone is ringing and it's ringing in your house you don't have a you know too much of a life 

230.44 231.37 A: uh-huh 

230.89 233.18 B: but um you know y- 

233.25 243.18 B: you can make money i mean it's there's a way of making money and i know that that ah there's ways of getting loans to get this going it's just you know too hard now [laughter] 

242.44 244.31 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

243.70 244.70 B: (( so [mn] )) 

245.22 260.12 A: i might actually kind of change my my idea because i'm not really a business oriented person so i said i'd open my own language school or something but i'd probably just buy a buy a um a franchise kind of business that's already proven successful 

259.53 262.29 B: really like what what are you interested in doing 

260.04 261.11 A: yeah 

261.87 263.48 A: well [sigh] 

263.72 271.04 A: i don't know i don't know [laughter] maybe like a barnes and noble or something because i'm the kind of the same i like i like books and 

270.42 271.37 B: right 

271.53 276.81 A: things like that but it costs a lot you know to to start your own franchise 

275.48 280.36 B: how about like a place like like a a caplin institute where you're teaching kids and 

279.75 284.20 A: oh that's true yeah i guess caplin would have some franchise opportunities 

283.67 285.80 B: yeah something like that 

285.36 286.72 A: that's true 

286.12 294.49 B: you know and then you could basically set it up you could have your computers you could have your your books um you could do referrals things like that 

294.84 295.73 B: yeah 

296.54 303.23 A: yeah and then i would i don't know i guess as the owner of a caplin kind of place i'd have to hire teachers or 

296.70 297.43 B: (( so [lipsmack] )) 

303.32 307.20 A: you know hire people to administer the tests and things like that so 

306.61 321.37 B: right well you can always start on your own right and then or if you know somebody that has a similar interest you know bring them in and then you could start off small and then make it bigger and it doesn't have to exactly be caplin but it could be something you design out of your own head 

319.88 320.80 A: uh-huh 

321.56 322.96 A: yeah 

322.35 323.59 B: (( so [mn] )) 

323.05 333.01 A: i know you make a lot more money usually if you own your business but every business owner i've seen does the like you say have you know they're totally tied to the business and don't have a lot of free time [mn] 

332.62 338.50 B: yeah that's it you know you've got to choose it's either quality of life which is you know you check out at five you're done 

338.65 347.81 B: or ah you know you you're tied to the but you know what all in all i have to say between the two because i work for a b- a company now and um i'm not 

347.74 354.70 B: not happy at all i haven't been since i worked there i've been looking to leave for the six years i've been there [laughter] so 

348.90 349.83 A: uh-huh 

354.93 358.98 B: i mean i after running a business your time is yours 

359.01 363.88 B: and um there's nothing more gratifying at the end of the day than saying you know 

363.78 374.41 B: i did this i created this and this is amazing and look where it's gone and and every day can be a new thing you know every day can be a new experience something new you learn about it 

365.85 366.80 A: mhm 

370.28 371.07 A: yeah 

374.32 381.18 B: um when you're working for someone else it's always the same crap year after year [laughter] you know same people 

378.84 383.06 A: yeah i think that is a benefit that it's a creative process so 

382.36 384.14 B: absolutely and that's 

383.10 384.89 A: whatever you can dream 

384.50 386.70 B: that's the spiritual journey of it all 

387.45 388.44 A: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

388.45 389.92 B: yeah 

390.02 392.05 B: so it's just the money part that 

392.26 393.54 B: holds you back 

393.15 394.21 A: uh-huh 

393.62 394.56 B: you know 

394.73 395.72 B: so 

396.07 396.85 B: that's 

396.08 400.59 A: i have a a friend who's a an artist in tucson and ah 

400.45 413.18 A: we would always dream this is a few years ago when we still lived in the same city but we always dreamed that she'd have sort of like this coffee shop sort of place but it would also be ah a place for her to exhibit her own art 

412.97 414.04 B: excellent 

413.01 417.91 A: and ah she was going to make it like a replica of the taj mahal [laughter] 

417.09 418.84 B: [laughter] 

418.04 421.01 A: there in the middle of the desert in tucson so [mn] 

420.43 421.67 B: that's cool 

422.01 424.07 B: sounds like a good idea to start from 

423.67 427.91 A: yeah but i i like what you said about location location is so key 

427.57 428.58 B: (( it is )) 

427.96 441.68 A: there there was a this business that i thought was just the coolest thing in tucson but the location was bad and so it didn't stay open for more than a few months but it was sort of the same idea it was like a coffee shop but they they showed films every 

436.17 437.15 B: yeah 

441.81 452.52 A: every i don't know like twice a week and ah they had it wasn't on t._v. but they had like a full size screen inside of this um coffee shop you 

452.31 453.22 B: right 

452.55 458.22 A: know and it was sort of m- modeled after the gap too with like wooden floors and um 

458.31 460.65 A: you know things for sale 

460.01 461.46 B: right right 

460.85 467.66 A: yeah it was a really neat idea it was in a way maybe too eclectic because it had you know too much going on and 

467.02 468.16 B: yeah 

467.78 470.88 A: but ah but the location was the major problem 

470.76 479.90 B: yeah well that's it you know what i know from being owning my own business and reading like i just mega read over like everything about having your own business 

479.82 493.82 B: um one thing they said is is that if you ever want to buy a business or you wa- ever want to see how crowded something is before you even decide go sit in front or across the street from the store and see how much traffic passes how much foot people how m- people on foot 

493.68 494.53 A: uh-huh 

493.88 505.33 B: um how m- where's the parking good you know um because that's a big key who wants to try and hike to get to a to a coffee shop or any establishment nobody wants to hike they want parking right in front 

504.96 505.89 A: right 

505.41 509.93 B: and um and basically that that's that's the big key for retail 

509.65 511.27 A: yeah that's true 

510.86 511.99 B: (( so ah )) 

512.12 513.86 B: yeah so you know 

513.96 517.38 B: it'll happen it just again like not right now 

517.73 519.43 B: and anything for you 

519.84 522.73 B: i feel like i'm manipulating this conversation 

521.59 524.71 A: oh no i just think that that's neat that you have that [mn] 

525.10 528.80 A: you know a real dream that you know you're go- you're working at 

528.49 529.52 B: yeah 

528.90 532.43 A: um for now i'm i'm still getting um 

532.46 539.69 A: you know my education finishing my masters degree and i'd like to get a doctorate and being in a you know work at a university as a professor 

539.43 540.42 B: right 

539.92 541.11 A: and ah 

541.54 551.05 A: i don't know if unless it's a private university i wouldn't really ha- have enough option to own you know the university or something i would just be a professor for it 

550.46 555.12 B: right right and you know it's good to learn for a while it sounds like you're young so 

555.05 557.76 A: yeah i'm twenty well i'm not too young i'm twenty eight 

557.46 572.38 B: well that's young [laughter] i'm in my forties and i've been there done that see you know i see people you know like you that you know pretty much just you have to you know what you have to do is you have to go out there and you have to work for somebody for a while and learn it 

558.47 559.53 A: [laughter] 

571.91 572.97 A: mhm 

572.39 584.69 B: learn how people do business and that's how you're going to learn how to do it and then you take if you ever decide that this isn't it you take what you know and you put it you know towards something that you know you might feel it's fulfilling 

575.86 576.59 A: (( yeah )) 

584.30 585.09 A: yeah 

584.71 586.45 B: you know everybody takes 

585.27 595.22 A: i heard once that i heard a piece of advice once and i'll just share it with you not that i can give you advice because you know a lot more abo- but it was a neat idea and and i h- i- it was ah that 

595.36 599.89 A: if you want to be successful like at a certain thing
