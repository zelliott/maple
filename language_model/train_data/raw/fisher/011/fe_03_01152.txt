17.69 25.02 A: would i would change the i guess what comes to mind just off the top of my head is that when i was in school 

25.39 28.31 A: i've always thought this is i would've of um 

28.54 29.86 A: really studied harder 

30.20 32.23 A: and taken it more serious 

32.23 33.09 B: oh yes 

32.88 38.37 A: and um i mean i did study hard when i was in school but i probably would have tried to learn more and 

38.60 39.68 A: get um 

39.80 51.29 A: i guess if the maturity level had been there then i would have um just studied much harder and tried to be at the very top of my class and taken college more seriously and studied harder then and 

51.72 54.30 B: you know what i've heard though is that college (( i uh )) 

54.56 56.31 B: completely agree i actually um 

56.62 57.77 B: i'm back in school 

58.31 60.18 B: and i'm still not studying as hard as i 

60.47 63.00 B: said that i would study after i graduated the first time but 

63.48 65.27 B: i heard that college is when 

65.63 66.25 B: you 

66.87 68.19 B: you (( )) socially 

68.84 71.17 B: and so you are taking all these academic classes and 

71.32 76.69 B: you are trying to study but you are really interacting with the people on your floor if you live in a dorm or your roommates 

77.25 80.47 B: the people with you cla- in your class your professors and you are learning 

80.86 81.73 B: those skills 

82.33 82.87 A: right 

82.34 86.10 B: and that is why you have to go back to school because you realize i haven't learned anything 

86.28 86.86 A: right 

86.98 87.67 B: so so 

88.35 89.74 B: i think we are on the same boat there 

88.37 88.83 A: hm 

89.82 90.36 A: right 

90.54 92.98 A: if you had to change something else what would you change 

93.13 93.52 B: um 

93.70 94.50 A: something besides that 

94.27 96.01 B: immediately i thought of 

96.24 97.96 B: i was supposed to go into the peace corps 

98.30 98.93 B: after 

98.50 99.19 A: mmm 

99.25 100.13 B: college and 

100.97 103.39 B: i didn't for various reasons and think that that 

104.63 107.46 B: has been a big regret but also more recently 

107.58 108.09 B: i got a 

108.64 114.41 B: pretty large bequest from my grandfather when he passed on and i don't know where it went 

114.75 115.47 A: mmm 

114.79 116.66 B: i've no idea i didn't put away 

116.81 117.92 B: to save i just 

118.48 122.43 B: you know i spent it here and there on my dogs and my mom and loans 

122.69 123.60 A: and that was gone 

123.67 125.80 B: when when you have a big chunk of money 

125.99 126.91 B: you should really 

127.16 128.02 B: save all of it 

128.80 131.75 B: you know -cause you are always going to have loans you are always going to have that bills whatever 

131.90 132.40 A: right 

132.20 135.44 B: those are going to get paid for somehow but if you have ten thousand dollars 

135.67 136.20 A: hm 

136.48 137.42 B: you know it could be 

137.71 139.62 B: put toward the house a car 

140.12 141.81 B: you know (( a )) dream vacation 

142.02 142.62 A: right 

142.74 144.88 B: so i regret those two definitely 

144.91 145.35 A: so 

145.54 146.15 A: yeah 

146.83 148.47 A: um let's see 

148.68 151.58 A: something else i regret if i can go back in time 

152.32 153.00 A: is 

154.58 156.66 A: i just want i guess a couple of things 

157.10 160.12 A: i just went through a divorce last year and i have two children 

160.58 168.04 A: and they are one of -em just turned three my little boy did and my little girl is six so i guess i would have taken the red flags 

168.21 169.39 A: more seriously 

169.86 171.90 A: had i known then what i know now 

172.18 176.88 A: i i don't regret it -cause i love my children but if i could go back in time then 

177.29 179.72 A: they weren't serious red flags they were 

180.47 182.26 A: (( )) seemed kind of minor 

182.40 184.02 A: but um i guess i would have 

185.55 188.86 A: i guess you never know if you when back in time but i guess if i knew now 

190.10 192.53 A: what i if i knew then what i know now then 

192.85 194.58 B: but what if it had turned out 

193.05 193.63 A: (( )) 

194.93 197.41 B: completely differently you would have said thank god 

197.74 199.05 B: i hung on 

199.39 200.18 A: that is true 

200.50 201.21 B: so 

201.41 201.87 B: that that's 

202.08 204.22 B: i mean that is always i'm i'm kind of dealing with a 

205.53 206.04 A: mhm 

205.82 208.28 B: you know anybody in a relationship is dealing with that and 

208.67 210.53 B: how do you know how to interpret 

211.27 212.04 B: the flags 

213.12 213.64 B: you know 

214.18 214.66 A: i know 

214.35 214.62 B: my 

215.07 218.25 B: my boy friend is in the other room but he said he just went on st. john's worts 

218.66 219.13 A: uh-huh 

219.06 222.43 B: and he has been an angel today he just got some at (( )) yesterday 

222.57 224.63 B: i'm like well if it is that easy then 

224.92 225.95 B: where the hell have st. 

226.14 228.13 B: john's worts been this whole time 

227.51 234.03 A: right and that is exactly what my issue was is my husband had the worst attitude in the world he was negative he was 

234.59 237.01 A: you know it got to the point to where he was abusive 

237.25 239.58 A: mentally and verbally because he was just 

237.30 238.10 B: oh 

239.68 240.13 A: so 

240.27 240.79 A: ill 

241.05 243.69 A: mannered and such a bad attitude all the time 

244.69 245.25 B: wow 

244.77 246.05 A: and i wish that i had 

246.46 252.06 A: if i went back in time um that when he was grumpy and irritable and i remember asking his parents 

252.52 253.83 A: you know way back if 

254.20 261.61 A: you know what is going on it seems that he is so he is just not happy with anything and is there something that i can do is there something that i should know or 
262.07 264.42 A: and i should have known then that that was a warning sign 

264.45 265.35 B: what did they say 

266.11 267.86 A: well you know that is 

267.99 268.27 A: just 

268.43 269.56 A: (( )) 

270.11 271.61 A: the way he is and 

271.99 275.68 A: no help at all so whenever we had issues i never went back to them at again 

276.45 277.09 B: wow 

276.47 279.54 A: and then ultimately we were married for seven years and ultimately 

279.97 282.44 A: um i really knew the first year we were married 

283.04 283.40 A: that 

283.84 286.25 A: that that was it and i stayed in it for seven 

286.37 288.30 A: and had two children and 

290.49 292.81 A: it was just if i could go back i would really 

293.93 295.99 A: oh just reconsider 

296.25 298.42 A: and and just try to take things more serious 

299.05 303.03 B: you know but though i don't know how many people you know that are still married but i know very very few 

303.28 305.33 A: i know it it is very and i i 

303.88 304.20 B: and 

305.71 311.84 A: i'm thirty four i will be thirty five next month and i will not get and i waited until i was twenty seven to get married it is not like i rushed 

311.87 312.35 B: oh 

312.65 314.44 A: and um i i won't do it again 

315.47 316.23 B: well 

316.59 318.57 B: i was going to say that it is kind of like just 

318.67 320.79 B: biologically how we are as a species 

321.84 323.42 B: my understanding from my own 

323.56 324.84 B: sad family is that 

325.66 327.45 B: you have children with the first husband 

328.20 328.87 B: because he is 

329.34 332.05 B: dashing or whatever something attractive and charismatic 

332.45 334.08 B: and the second husband you marry 

334.45 335.80 B: is the father for your children 

336.33 336.88 A: hm 

337.13 338.03 A: that is interesting 

337.93 341.41 B: yeah and and maybe the third and fourth too but 

341.99 344.16 B: you know i mean i literally i know 

344.27 345.48 B: two people who 

345.66 347.06 B: are married happily and 

348.34 350.08 B: and i'm not sure what their problem is but 

350.98 352.08 B: i it's just it's 

352.73 355.97 B: i think it's human nature you know people do change and 

356.14 360.71 B: and how are you supposed to take the red flag seriously again like how do you know 

360.91 361.52 A: i know 

361.00 362.26 B: you don't know 

362.17 362.89 A: you don't know 

362.92 364.05 B: you trust that you made 

363.28 365.41 A: that is why it just seems that 

366.18 374.76 A: oh married people are so far uh i mean happily married people are so few and far between and the ones that are you don't know if there is some big secret behind the 

375.04 376.00 B: exactly 

375.41 376.88 A: the front door so 

377.21 381.56 A: it just seems to me that you don't know and if you could go back in time 

381.99 384.35 A: how what what are you supposed to know 

384.24 388.49 B: yeah exactly would you not have had your children where would you be in life i mean 

384.66 385.41 A: i don't know 

387.73 388.16 A: right 

388.67 391.74 B: there's so many things you you think that you can trust yourself 

392.14 396.41 B: because you know i met this person i fell in love with him for some reason was i completely stupid 

396.63 397.10 A: right 

397.00 399.28 B: you know there was something there obviously initially 

399.63 400.06 A: right 

400.04 403.08 B: and so how do you know at what point that dies or if it is hiding or if 

403.18 404.98 B: you need to do something differently so 

403.98 404.43 A: right 

405.15 406.98 A: my mother and my grandmother (( )) 

407.26 412.18 A: um you should of known that your marriage wasn't working and you shouldn't have had your son so 

411.80 413.51 B: oh that is not very supportive 

412.55 418.13 A: but but you know what my baby i i wouldn't and that and actually i never really told them this but 

418.49 421.00 A: um if i could go back i wouldn't change it 

421.18 424.75 A: and i would have him again because i though i know this is not going to work but 

425.17 425.79 A: um 

426.00 430.58 A: you know i'm thirty four years old and i had him when i guess i was thirty one 

431.09 434.67 A: and um no i wouldn't change it because they are both from the same father they 

435.07 435.71 A: you know (( )) 

435.89 440.76 A: uh you know i didn't want to get out of one and rush to find somebody else i knew i wanted another child so 

439.39 439.81 B: right 

441.01 445.82 A: i did it on purpose and whether it be it be wrong or it be right i knew i could handle both of my children by myself 

446.05 446.30 B: that's 

446.43 448.15 B: that's pretty good then then 

449.29 451.64 B: then it sounds like that worked out how you wanted it to 

451.82 454.71 B: i mean it's the most important thing and i think for most of 

454.89 455.98 B: women who uh are 

456.11 456.74 B: like that 

457.21 457.91 B: is to have 

458.18 459.25 B: children that you can 

459.54 460.71 B: love and raise 

461.09 461.56 A: right 

462.04 468.08 B: and not to have the father and the husband then i mean that is what my mom did she did the exact same thing 

466.88 467.61 A: be careful 

467.78 468.46 A: who you marry 

469.42 471.89 B: be careful who you marry but still i mean even if you are 

472.14 475.61 B: so careful you think you do everything right you are going to get a shock eventually 

475.68 476.35 A: mhm 

476.27 478.53 B: i mean what if it is in twenty years when your kids 

479.17 482.15 B: are going to have a nervous breakdown because their parents are getting divorced 

482.12 482.60 A: right 

482.68 485.69 B: you know i was like three weeks old or three months old when my dad cheated 

486.27 486.83 A: mmm 

486.30 486.59 B: so 

486.89 488.72 B: i i never knew him and it is fine 

489.15 489.69 A: mmm 

489.70 497.78 B: you know people say oh you should have a mother and a father of course you should have you have just have a lot of things you can have everything you ever wanted but realistically 

494.50 494.95 A: right 

498.20 499.36 B: people do not get along 

499.70 500.73 B: for their entire lives 

501.05 501.49 A: right 

501.62 502.00 B: and 

502.33 504.87 B: you make the best of it and i love my mom she and i have 

505.12 508.55 B: such a close relationship and you and your kids will probably have the same thing 

508.48 509.99 A: yeah we are much closer now 

510.06 511.58 B: yeah it is really interesting 

510.58 512.45 A: now that we are out of the chaos and the 

512.24 515.49 B: yeah you you just compensate and you make new dynamics and 

516.11 517.74 B: and who is to say which is better 

517.85 518.31 A: right
