24.01 26.86 B: well if there is one thing i could change i guess is 

26.99 28.38 B: very personal to me 

30.19 31.12 B: the only thing that comes 

31.26 32.00 B: to mind 

35.61 36.76 B: nineteen years old 

36.94 37.51 B: i 

37.87 38.13 B: got 

38.46 38.98 B: pregnant 

40.01 41.63 B: wasn't married and um 

41.78 42.28 B: ended up 

42.51 43.74 B: having the baby and 

43.88 45.66 B: giving him up for adoption and 

46.45 48.54 B: there hasn't been a day that has gone by that i've 

48.89 50.90 B: you know not thought about it and regretted it 

52.38 53.27 A: i see 

53.09 54.60 B: so it is something you know that's 

55.19 56.76 B: really effected my life and 

56.93 61.21 B: if there was any way to go back in time that's definitely what i would have changed 

62.45 63.19 A: hm 

63.96 65.33 A: that is interesting 

66.06 69.70 A: i uh of course have never been pregnant 

70.63 71.49 B: okay 

72.02 78.10 A: and uh never had that uh experience although one of my daughters 

78.81 79.43 A: uh 

79.52 82.42 A: husband wanted her to have an abortion 

82.87 85.56 A: which we didn't particularly care for 

86.81 87.72 B: understandably 

88.86 89.85 A: but 

90.27 92.32 A: to get back to a personal thing 

93.55 94.38 A: uh 

94.91 99.38 A: there isn't too much in my life that i would have changed if i could 

100.81 103.08 A: um i'm pretty well satisfied 

103.51 105.14 B: so you are pretty happy with how 

105.41 106.88 B: life is for you today 

107.61 108.14 A: yes 

107.62 109.00 B: and sort of with no regrets 

109.38 111.29 A: uh 

112.45 114.54 A: my only regret perhaps 

114.91 116.10 A: is that 

116.35 116.89 A: uh 

117.13 118.31 A: in high school 

119.11 120.39 A: i was a 

120.56 121.92 A: class clown 

122.84 125.75 A: and uh consequently 

126.14 128.00 A: my grades were lousy 

128.50 132.97 A: i think i'm reasonably intelligent and could have done 

133.51 136.90 A: a little more with my life perhaps had i 

137.56 141.09 A: uh pursued an education then 

139.23 139.71 B: uh-huh 

142.38 145.13 A: later after twenty years in the navy 

146.22 148.57 A: i went in to um 

148.76 153.02 A: college and got a degree and uh 

154.70 157.90 A: that hasn't changed my life a great deal because 

158.41 159.56 A: i was married 

160.03 161.26 A: had four children 

161.91 164.92 A: and you know what children do to you 

164.43 165.92 B: yeah well i wish i did 

166.79 167.25 A: pardon 

166.80 167.98 B: but i can imagine 

169.11 169.96 A: well 

170.62 176.60 A: uh children are a very stabilizing influence as far as i am concerned 

177.16 179.09 A: you do what you have to do 

179.84 181.11 A: where you have children 

181.79 183.94 A: i don't think you have too much choice 

181.84 182.19 B: (( birth )) 

184.05 185.51 B: (( birth )) is what you want to do 

185.73 186.27 B: sometimes 

187.31 187.75 A: well 

187.97 188.67 A: perhaps 

189.91 191.07 A: i'm not uh 

192.46 194.27 A: of the opinion that uh 

194.39 197.35 A: children are routinely 

197.83 198.42 A: uh 

198.82 200.01 A: abused 

200.40 201.51 A: i think uh 

201.87 204.68 A: perhaps they are not routinely disciplined 

205.44 206.96 A: in the proper way 

206.93 207.45 B: uh-huh 

208.62 209.40 A: but uh 

211.43 213.83 A: that is about it as far as i can tell you 

214.36 214.94 B: yeah 

215.36 218.98 B: um they didn't really leave us a question that could go on i mean 

219.78 220.33 B: you know we could 

220.60 224.96 B: talk more about the same thing or i don't even know um this is my first call 

225.73 226.73 A: mine too 

226.83 228.56 B: yeah so i'm i'm not really sure 

228.99 229.58 B: what they ex- 

229.68 229.95 B: -pect 

230.57 232.84 A: well could i ask you a question 

233.09 233.66 B: sure 

234.25 237.84 A: uh considering the events of the last 

238.09 239.68 A: four or five hours 

239.62 240.22 B: uh-huh 

239.84 241.98 A: what do you think of what is going on 

243.93 244.71 B: i think we 

245.07 245.72 B: the country 

245.86 246.73 B: has to do 

247.10 248.21 B: what we have to do 

249.91 250.52 A: well i'm 

250.72 253.11 A: somewhat of the same opinion 

254.64 255.60 A: i think it is 

254.85 255.33 B: i mean it 

256.26 257.05 A: excuse me 

257.15 257.69 B: go ahead 

257.88 268.38 A: i think perhaps it is going to be longer than anybody thinks uh in terms of after the war 

268.53 269.53 A: situation 

270.44 271.01 A: but 

271.81 275.12 A: i think we better get something done or we are going to have 

275.43 277.11 A: a lot of nine elevens 

277.23 277.77 B: right 

281.08 283.26 A: i hate to see 

283.94 285.26 A: a war start 

285.56 291.16 A: because i have grandsons and granddaughters as far as that goes um 

291.35 293.18 A: that could be in harms way 

294.50 295.08 A: but 

296.87 297.92 A: just as 

298.06 300.99 A: the two wars that i was involved in 

301.79 302.42 A: um 

304.19 307.00 A: you can't make a cake without breaking some eggs 

307.94 308.44 B: right 

309.67 310.77 B: unfortunately 

311.10 312.06 A: that is true 

311.94 313.01 B: right i mean we can't 

313.32 317.18 B: be picking and choosing you know we want this but we don't want this and this to happen 

318.52 320.73 A: well that is true that uh 

320.87 323.28 A: sometimes you buy the whole package 

325.33 326.03 A: yup 

328.78 329.28 B: um 

328.87 330.06 A: i was born 

330.17 332.26 A: in uh the middle west 

333.19 334.18 A: and uh 

334.35 335.70 A: went to college there 

336.63 337.82 A: but um 

339.61 340.91 A: i've lived 

341.29 342.67 A: all over the world 

343.64 344.52 A: and uh 

345.50 349.63 A: uh as well as hawaii 

349.06 349.95 B: you you were here 

350.25 351.76 A: oh yes many times 

351.16 351.75 B: oh 

353.02 356.17 A: i have a son-in-law that is a (( real )) admiral 

357.33 357.98 A: so 

358.41 361.80 A: we visited him and his family many times 

366.74 371.35 A: well as i say i've lived all over the world and 

371.80 372.74 A: i think that 

372.90 375.55 A: most of the anti- american 

376.15 376.93 A: sentiment 

378.03 379.79 A: is due to envy 

380.91 381.67 B: i agree 

382.92 384.11 B: i definitely agree 

382.95 383.46 A: the 

386.72 388.21 A: the greatest um 

389.07 391.34 A: uh thing seems to be 

391.58 393.71 A: that nobody wants to admit 

394.18 396.78 A: that they are making money off the situation 

397.76 398.48 A: france 

399.04 399.53 A: um 

399.71 401.70 A: by the way i have a good friend 

402.38 403.78 A: uh in france 

404.55 407.45 A: he and i e. mail practically everyday 

407.92 416.08 A: arguing the fine points of this war and so forth it is quite interesting he denies that the french uh 

410.68 411.46 B: uh-huh 

416.68 417.14 A: um 

417.51 420.29 A: have any part in uh arming 

420.47 421.19 A: saddam 

422.54 422.93 A: well 

424.64 427.05 A: we don't see eye to eye on that issue 

430.22 432.71 A: but anyway getting back to your 

432.96 433.47 A: um 

433.94 434.49 A: problem 

436.12 437.22 A: you say 

437.40 440.49 A: or your regret i should say 

440.06 440.56 B: uh-huh 

441.09 443.09 A: you say that it is um 

443.53 446.42 A: an ongoing thing with you that uh 

446.89 447.75 A: the regret 

447.89 450.03 A: uh hasn't been resolved 

450.33 451.28 B: no it hasn't 

451.79 453.26 A: oh that is too bad 

453.25 455.75 B: yeah i mean i've always been one to 

456.13 458.84 B: especially after that you know i was so young and 

459.48 463.03 B: you know i wasn't in the position to really provide for him so i didn't want to 

463.55 465.23 B: you know bring him into my world 

470.24 470.91 B: could provide 

472.88 474.12 B: so hard to give him up 

475.57 478.02 B: you know i was still young in my early twenties and 

478.69 481.65 B: trying to forget and everything but as i get older i'm 

481.82 482.87 B: forty three now 

483.31 483.70 B: you know it's 

484.07 485.09 B: just has not been 

485.24 487.93 B: getting easier at all in fact it is getting harder 

488.77 492.90 A: hm have you made any effort to find the youngster 

492.73 493.25 B: yeah 

494.62 496.10 A: any luck 

495.81 496.83 B: no not yet 

497.69 498.42 A: mhm 

499.90 501.89 A: well that is unfortunate when 

502.49 503.13 A: it is 

503.54 506.36 A: such a problem that there isn't some way of 

507.75 508.19 A: you know 

508.83 510.40 A: uh resolving that 

510.57 513.14 A: particular part of the problem at least 

518.54 521.10 B: is there like a time limit on this do you know 

521.34 522.29 A: i don't know 

522.59 525.31 A: i'm in the dark as well as you i guess 

530.67 531.16 A: well
