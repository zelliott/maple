6.75 8.67 A: good have you ever done this before 

8.73 11.86 B: no i've never done this before but oh 

10.60 17.50 A: okay well this is really interesting because this is my second time tonight and it was the same question last time 

18.36 20.74 A: so [laughter] 

20.62 22.36 B: [laughter] well ah 

21.15 22.33 A: but um 

23.20 26.43 A: ah so do you have any do you have anything that you would change 

23.20 24.01 B: (( what )) 

26.98 28.24 B: (( well um )) 

28.73 31.61 B: let's see i guess i would've um 

32.52 36.09 B: probably done better at school and stayed at college sooner 

36.54 37.51 A: okay 

36.75 45.46 B: that's probably what i would've changed i guess because but then if i would have done that i started out as a early childhood major 

45.46 46.24 A: uh-huh 

45.58 56.91 B: and now i'm a computer information systems major so who knows i'll be teaching school in how to be a computer nerd [laughter] 

54.40 55.45 A: yeah 

56.20 62.32 A: yeah so it's interesting how the choices we make you know just one little choice can make a big difference in your life 

62.62 63.42 A: (( you know )) 

62.71 64.84 B: yeah that's that's true 

64.67 67.24 A: yeah well let's see last um 

66.08 66.91 B: (( [noise] )) 

68.22 75.52 A: um m- mine i wish that i had been more involved in school in highschool 

75.98 84.33 A: that i had been more you know involved with the like year book and just being involved i i went to school i did my work 

84.16 98.30 A: and then i bailed you know i would go and and go play go go hang out with my friends get into trouble you know just whatever but i didn't want to be at school i didn't like school and now i look back and i think i really missed out on a lot and i 

98.33 103.70 A: i think that's also leading to college it would have been really fun and it would have been a neat experience 

103.92 104.92 A: to ah 

104.98 108.37 A: like do the college thing 'cause i i went to a trade school 

108.68 112.15 B: (( yeah i wish i i w- wish i would've went away to college )) 

112.29 114.61 B: 'cause um i went to a school in 

114.65 126.64 B: georgia called georgia state and ah when i first started there you know there was no on campus living or anything like that so it was just like going downtown going to school and going home 

126.94 131.30 B: you know it really wasn't like a real college experience so 

127.02 127.94 A: yeah 

131.42 135.31 B: i still would have done that that would have probably ah been more fun 

134.28 135.66 A: yeah that would've been fun 

136.43 146.71 A: yeah i think that's that i would have to agree with that me too i think i w- would've liked to have gone somewhere where it would've been a a new change a challenge new scene you know 

147.39 157.47 A: but um now last time we did this we just sat here and we talked and we were waiting for the rec- you know for something to prompt us to stop or whatever [laughter] 

156.99 157.92 B: yeah 

157.64 161.07 A: and nothing did we pushed pound nothing happened 

161.24 163.29 A: so um 

163.41 166.82 A: is there anything else that that you would change that 

163.65 164.95 B: (( i don't )) 

167.51 169.88 B: well let's see 

168.32 173.90 A: if you could travel back in time i think that's what they're going for is if you could travel back in time what would you do differently 

173.44 181.63 B: [laughter] well to travel back in time well i mean i guess the only things i could change would be things had to 

181.78 186.17 B: (( study for um my my decision of what ah )) 

186.24 189.06 B: i guess i would've 

189.27 192.99 B: i guess one thing i would've changed i guess i would've um 

193.42 200.60 B: maybe moved to a different city when i had the opportunity when i had the opportunity um 

195.98 196.79 A: okay 

201.40 205.72 B: i should have went back to new orleans i stayed in georgia i i think i'd rather have 

205.79 208.56 B: stayed in new orleans earlier maybe i would've you 

209.84 212.29 B: know move back there 

212.77 213.86 B: (( but you know )) 

212.84 217.28 A: [noise] i'm having a hard i'm having a hard time hearing you are you doing something or 

217.56 220.08 A: while you're talking to me okay 

217.75 218.65 B: no 

220.01 221.38 B: no i'm just sitting 

220.63 225.95 A: but okay 'cause i'm hearing like rustling or something then ah maybe it's on my end i don't know 

224.26 225.13 B: oh 

226.09 227.37 B: oh it might just 

226.14 227.46 A: okay well ah 

227.49 228.91 A: jeez 

228.94 230.26 A: (( um )) 

230.32 233.13 A: well i think you know as you get older and you get more 

233.16 234.08 A: (( ah )) 

234.76 236.87 A: no i've i've gotten more 

237.11 250.15 A: self-secure you know when when you're young you think you know it all but you really don't know anything and you really are pretty insecure you can be confident but you're you know you just don't know anything [laughter] life life beats you up you know 

247.41 248.75 B: yeah that's true 

250.21 253.79 A: i think if i were to go back i would probably make 

254.32 255.50 A: um 

257.87 265.23 A: [noise] i think that my choices that i would've made i mean like i i think back and i think gosh you know i really should've gone 

265.41 270.77 A: um you know i had at one point i had wanted to work on a cruise line 

271.33 277.24 A: um at one point i wanted to be a flight attendant you know 'cause i love to travel 

277.32 283.16 A: but i think i probably would've chosen to do something you know at that young period in my life 

283.21 283.80 B: (( [noise] )) 

283.42 285.07 A: that um 

285.47 286.21 B: (( [noise] )) 

285.67 288.12 A: would've allowed me to travel more 

288.69 293.14 B: you know i really i guess i i guess i really would have 

293.10 305.39 B: i used to perform at highschool i i used to sing and um do drama and all that i really wish i would've stuck to that you know that would have been cool and i would have been able to just um 

305.55 315.81 B: you know perform 'cause i miss performing and i guess if there was one thing i really would go back and do i would concentrate on my music more and i would've i would've 

315.75 325.51 B: put that in my mind i probably would be doing a lot of different different things than what i was back if i was able to go back and just like you know concentrate on my music 

326.00 327.38 B: that's what you know 

326.24 328.62 A: so what did you play an instrument or 

329.05 331.22 B: (( i was learning how to play the piano )) 

331.19 332.13 A: okay 

331.40 334.11 B: and i used to sing so 

333.85 334.88 A: okay 

335.32 339.09 B: i guess that- that's what i guess that's one thing i really would change 

341.01 352.01 A: well really but [laughter] now this is my second call it's funny i wasn't expecting to get you know another call and i certainly wasn't expecting to get asked the same question but 

352.17 354.37 A: once you really start thinking about it 

354.38 363.01 A: i mean you know i love my life i you know i do i have a great life i have great kids i have an incredible husband i'm able to stay home i mean but i 

363.27 372.44 A: just think back to you know now you know i'm older and i'm i'm super responsible i have so many responsibilities now and it would have been nice for me to live a little bit more 

372.72 380.51 A: when i was young you know to experiment some more you know you know to be more daring like i said you know try a job or 

380.43 390.82 A: that was you know where i had to travel new or somewhere where maybe i had never you know i didn't know anyone or something like that but i would never do it now i mean i couldn't for one thing but i i 

391.00 392.39 A: (( you know i just couldn't )) 

392.75 395.94 A: so i can't now ever again you know [laughter] 

392.87 393.96 B: yeah 

395.58 397.22 B: [laughter] 

396.30 399.56 A: till i retire maybe and the kids are gone and my husband and i can 

399.64 402.79 A: do some of that stuff but you know what i mean 

402.77 410.92 B: yeah i understand 'cause i guess now you know you have bills to pay and you know you can't just be ah id- idealistic 

403.20 403.95 A: (( oh )) 

404.46 405.02 A: (( yeah )) 

407.48 408.42 A: yeah 

410.75 412.98 A: right right 

411.14 417.59 B: about it you can't just go and say well hey well tomorrow i'm just going to let just backpack through europe just because 

417.95 419.08 B: or i'm 

417.99 419.88 A: (( yeah right [noise] )) 

419.27 427.56 B: i'm going to just you know i'm going to be a artist [laughter] i'm just going to st- stop working and just sell paintings for a living there i go 

423.21 424.05 A: (( yes )) 

426.58 427.45 A: yeah 

427.54 433.67 A: yeah well i mean i think about what i used to live on every month you know as far as a wage 

428.51 429.45 B: you know 

433.81 438.00 A: my gosh how did i do it [laughter] i mean how did i 

437.01 438.01 B: yeah that's 

438.07 445.95 A: survive [laughter] because i look at my bills now and i go oh man ooh la la yeah but um 

444.75 445.65 B: yeah 

446.45 456.87 B: i think that's when you have you know tell me are you where you worry less about those things 'cause i guess then you know everyone you know was like wow just deal whatever 

456.67 467.70 B: [laughter] no- nobody's thinking about well you know what's the long term impact you know ah you know being responsible you know you don't think about it until -til later 

457.44 458.32 A: (( yes )) 

464.55 465.50 A: right 

467.47 472.53 B: on so then it's like you are enjoying being irresponsible or you know 

468.14 469.45 A: right 

471.24 472.21 A: [laughter] 

472.73 482.93 B: just doing whatever you know yack a little live off just a little money and yeah i can hang out every day you know you wonder how you party with little money [laughter] 

479.30 480.08 A: (( i know )) 

481.78 492.62 A: yeah right right i mean i yeah i'll tell you you know that saying youth is wasted on the on the young it's so true [laughter] not that i'm old i mean i'm thirty seven 

490.07 491.49 B: [laughter] 

492.61 499.96 A: i you know i'm still quite young but ah you know my life is completely differently ah you so 

500.02 503.29 A: i think that's that's probably i mean maybe maybe i would have ah 

504.12 512.96 A: if i could time travel knowing what i know now i would probably hunt down my husband sooner [laughter] find him and marry him 

510.75 512.81 B: [laughter] 

513.03 518.96 A: sooner so that we could have spent some 'cause we got married a little you know we were both in our early thirties and 

513.24 514.29 B: (( oh )) 

519.21 525.20 A: um we i think we would have spent if we had got married earlier we would have spent time just 

525.29 528.91 A: for us with us instead we were like well we don't want to wait 

528.93 539.02 A: too much longer to have kids and all that you know so we we didn't have have a whole lot of time for us to be a married couple before children got into the picture and that type of thing 

539.37 540.21 A: but 

540.77 542.22 A: (( yeah anyway [laughter] )) 

541.02 542.03 B: yeah 

542.87 551.14 B: well i i guess you know in that same token i would have been like to have you know done some things where i can be able to travel more now 

551.60 554.29 B: you know and just be able to um you 

554.65 563.63 B: know see more have seen more of the world you know instead of now playing catch-up you know to to try and do some of those things 

557.96 558.81 A: yeah 

562.97 564.41 A: yeah right 

564.50 572.23 A: right i mean you know and i and i i was always so super super responsible that i'd never i didn't i can't say never but i didn't 

572.81 583.10 A: do a lot of spontaneous things and i did back in ninety four i a friend called me said she had an opportunity for lodging in france 

583.14 590.50 A: and she was going to go did i want to go and i made a decision and twenty one days later i was on a plane to europe
