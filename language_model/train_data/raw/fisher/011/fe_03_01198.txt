0.24 1.58 B: (( hello )) 

1.06 2.36 A: hello [laughter] 

2.02 4.33 B: hi my name is connie tipido 

5.06 6.19 A: i'm amy 

7.18 8.36 B: hi amy 

8.46 11.14 B: (( um have you ever done this before oh )) 

11.03 12.93 A: no [laughter] this is my first call 

12.42 14.89 B: wonderful me too [laughter] 

13.99 15.54 A: [laughter] 

15.02 18.31 B: i was really hoping i was going to get somebody who'd done this before 

17.95 19.23 A: [laughter] 

18.66 26.03 B: the topic is if somebody would give us a million dollars with the stipulation that we could never talk to our best friend again 

27.81 30.94 B: (( um how do you feel about that [laughter] )) 

31.66 38.70 A: i don't know my my best friend lives in in germany so i'm thinking if i could still email her [laughter] and write letters 

37.78 40.57 B: [laughter] and that's not talking correct [laughter] 

39.80 41.46 A: (( correct [laughter] )) 

41.15 43.48 B: see i hadn't thought about it from that angle 

43.52 47.81 B: that would be a possibility in today's world that you could never 

47.29 50.06 A: or i could learn sign language for when we visit 

49.64 61.02 B: well now that's true too see i hadn't thought about that either i keep thinking there is absolutely no way in the whole world that i would never talk to that person again there is nothing worth that 

61.46 67.22 A: yeah yeah if it was just no communication no seeing at all i i would have to say no too i think 

66.32 71.27 B: yeah 'cause that's that's you know that that's one thing that it's like you know 

71.62 78.75 B: friends are friends [laughter] they're like family it's like you know somebody sticks with you through thin and thick and thin 

78.85 82.00 B: you're absolutely going to have to 

82.03 84.37 B: you know stand behind them and 

84.46 87.76 B: not even for money even though it'd be nice 

87.38 91.60 A: [laughter] yeah and then they tax away so much of it anyway [mn] 

91.44 94.24 B: that's true yeah we'd just make uncle same even 

93.26 94.95 A: it wouldn't be a whole million 

94.67 98.42 B: yeah we'd make uncle sam even richer and that would be no fun 

98.19 100.14 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

98.81 100.18 B: [laughter] 

102.11 107.73 B: so like just what other kind of angles would there be on this topic um 

109.50 110.50 A: (( mm )) 

112.16 115.26 B: 'cause it's my understanding that we have to talk for ten minutes 

114.30 116.39 A: for ten minutes [laughter] yes 

116.24 118.15 B: (( gee whiz mm )) 

120.04 121.09 B: uh 

120.11 127.58 A: no i guess i would wonder who is this person that is gonna give a million dollars for that and is it just a joke and 

126.92 128.14 B: that's true 

128.30 129.51 B: that's true 

130.56 137.81 B: and uh who'd have money to give in a situation like that that you would you know forfeit your best friend 

139.11 140.40 B: that would be interesting 

141.57 145.02 B: not a very kind person [laughter] 

141.68 143.02 A: (( [laughter] )) 

145.48 147.62 B: makes you wonder if they have any friends 

147.95 149.40 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

149.02 154.19 B: and and what do they consider to be you know that money is more important than friends 

157.74 159.03 B: interesting 

158.30 162.86 A: [noise] yeah and i wonder if you could discuss this with your best friend first 

163.40 166.88 A: split the money or if you had some really good thing that it was gonna go to 

167.30 168.43 A: (( [laughter] )) 

167.68 169.39 B: yeah that's true 

171.36 180.12 B: could give it to a charity or something like that but then would it make it worth it [laughter] i'm kinda like you i like the idea of the sign language and the email 

176.54 177.50 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

180.00 181.07 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

180.40 186.39 B: [laughter] and that would make then you would have to consider you would really have to maybe consider that 

187.52 192.52 B: gee i did not realise that ten minutes was going to be a very lengthy period of time [laughter] 

193.26 194.22 A: [laughter] 

194.64 196.21 B: you live where 

196.29 198.08 A: washington state

204.32 212.27 B: interesting in in the state of washington and now after nine one one i'm i'm sure that [mn] you all even 

212.35 216.45 B: build a a closer bond like everybody did here in louisiana 

216.77 220.72 B: you know and and that's what you know when i read the topic it was like 

220.95 225.75 B: ooh after nine one one you know everybody got closer and things like that it's like 

225.90 228.50 B: i i just i i couldn't see it 

228.74 232.52 B: and then with the world fixing to go to war it's like you know 

232.77 234.82 B: friends are gonna need friends 

236.55 237.64 A: yeah 

240.20 241.93 A: (( yeah but it's a strange question )) 

242.12 242.86 A: [laughter]

246.90 247.83 B: (( mm ))

254.17 255.31 B: yeah

260.95 264.00 B: oh wow seventeen years [laughter] that's interesting 

264.28 268.18 B: the the person that i would consider to be my best friend 

268.66 273.12 B: is actually she's originally from california and she moved to louisiana 

273.43 275.09 B: (( uh when she got married and )) 

276.49 281.45 B: two totally different people okay but for some reason we bonded 

281.68 285.41 B: and and we've both been through a whole lot 

285.57 292.49 B: and probably if i had to guess it's probably been longer than that my first child is now 

292.60 296.18 B: twenty four so i've known her for twenty four years 

299.01 299.94 B: hello 

299.65 300.65 A: (( yes [laughter] )) 

300.10 303.66 B: okay [laughter] i've known her for twenty four years 

303.85 309.65 B: and it's like there's just no way that i could you know give up our friendship for nothing with her 

311.39 315.23 B: even though we're we're two totally different people [laughter] okay 

316.21 320.67 B: it seems like there has always been something that we have always bonded 

321.04 322.76 B: and kept us together 

323.15 325.80 B: she sees things in different lights than i do 

326.56 330.82 A: mm that's interesting my best friend i think we're friends because we are so much alike and we're 

330.90 331.96 B: really 

331.48 334.71 A: both kind of different you know from most people 

334.59 335.57 B: uh-huh 

334.84 336.63 A: that we found a lot in common 

336.74 339.58 B: oh okay so that was your common bond 

339.30 340.46 A: mhm 

340.07 345.69 B: yeah see my friend her name is angie she makes me see things in a different light 

346.41 357.03 B: and i find that very very helpful i'm i'm kind of i guess closed minded i see things my own way [laughter] and she helps me to see things in another way and it's like oh okay then 

357.87 361.01 B: so i've always found that to be very helpful for me 

358.11 358.72 A: (( mm )) 

361.05 369.39 B: in in our our friendship and i really i can't wait to call her tomorrow and ask her this question and see what [laughter] she would say 

366.96 370.10 A: [laughter] yeah [laughter] 

369.44 374.06 B: [laughter] and say okay angie if somebody would offer you a million dollars 

374.12 376.77 B: but you could never talk to me again 

376.89 382.30 B: she would probably say the same thing you did could we email each other [laughter] 

380.10 380.72 A: (( [cough] )) 

382.92 385.15 B: it's like going around the topic it's like 

385.22 393.17 B: [mn] no form of communication but i never thought about email or sign language those would be different avenues 

393.35 401.45 A: yeah now if my best friend lived next door then i would just have to say no way but since she's in germany anyway and we see each other about every two years 

401.08 402.06 B: oh wow 

401.87 406.12 A: and we mostly do just communicate by email [laughter] yeah 

403.94 404.95 B: really 

405.40 411.53 B: wow because i was going to ask you how do you communicate with somebody who's so far away i mean that's 

410.71 415.65 A: mostly email 'cause the phone is not that expensive any more but you know when you're nine hours apart and everything 

415.52 417.75 B: time time's a factor 

417.29 419.68 A: we both have young children and yeah 

419.39 420.66 B: oh okay 

420.69 422.31 B: (( that's interesting [laughter] )) 

422.87 428.14 B: yeah time i had a son who was in military and time was he was in japan 

428.29 433.18 B: and and that was always such a big thing was to communicate because of the time difference 

433.87 435.38 B: i found that hard 

437.25 438.77 B: well that's interesting 

439.10 441.27 B: so you both have you have small children 

441.59 442.43 A: (( yeah yeah no )) 

442.21 443.07 B: yeah 

445.94 450.71 B: i cannot think of another angle to speak on this topic 

451.55 454.58 A: are they gonna break in and tell us when it's ten minutes [laughter] 

453.94 455.54 B: they're supposed to 

455.12 457.28 A: okay [laughter] 'cause i didn't look at the clock 

457.25 461.30 B: yes i didn't either they're supposed to come in and and say that 

461.37 466.19 B: you know we've con- we've conversed long well that was my understanding i should say 

467.62 468.54 B: (( mm )) 

471.45 474.91 B: yeah who would offer somebody a million dollars it 

477.19 483.61 B: would have to be something like research or something like that i mean first of all who's got a million dollars to give away for no reason 

483.56 484.63 A: mhm 

488.41 490.13 B: so are you a stay at home mum 

490.28 491.10 A: yes 

490.99 492.07 B: yeah 

492.92 498.54 B: i am too now i i did work out for a little while however i'm back at home now 

500.22 504.49 B: and basically all of my children are my my baby is sixteen 

505.75 508.57 A: (( i just have one four year old )) 

507.91 508.88 B: (( how old )) 

508.77 510.89 A: i just have one four year old 

510.28 512.61 B: oh gosh [laughter] i have five 

515.99 521.74 B: and i'm thinking their friends you know if that question were posed to them with their friends 

522.06 530.51 B: my kids would just have a blind fit there would be no way there would be no be- ways that money would entice them 'cause they're very very close bonded 

531.55 534.06 B: extremely close bonded [laughter] 

534.45 541.83 B: so even even in uh uh in younger children i really don't think that even the money factor would come into play with mine 

541.99 544.30 B: you know i i i have children like 

544.73 547.59 B: twenty four twenty three 

547.67 553.81 B: uh twenty seventeen and sixteen and even the sixteen and seventeen year olds 

554.50 560.14 B: they're you know they're so closely bonded with their friends there is no way that even money 

561.78 567.70 B: would tell them you know oh no i'll i'll never give up you know my friendship there is no way they would do that 

567.57 568.21 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

568.67 569.71 A: yeah 

571.28 571.93 B: mm 

572.53 574.85 A: i guess that's a good thing to have friends that are 

575.12 575.87 B: (( oh )) 

575.88 579.46 B: they're believe me they're thick and thin they're closer than bosom buddies 

580.25 581.30 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

581.27 585.49 B: so i guess even age doesn't [mn] play a factor in that either 

586.31 588.94 B: you know to say that money would make a difference 

590.68 594.58 B: it's interesting i can't wait to ask all of my children [laughter] and see 

595.24 598.38 B: if in fact it you know even if that would
