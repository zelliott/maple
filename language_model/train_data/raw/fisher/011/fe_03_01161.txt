64.97 65.47 A: right 

65.24 67.88 B: but i don't have a degree because i didn't finish high school 

67.97 68.42 A: uh-huh

71.66 72.06 A: right 

72.63 73.99 B: done all that kind of stuff 

72.67 73.26 A: well i mean 

73.75 75.25 A: i mean i i'm in uh 

75.44 82.41 A: in grad school now and there's a lo- there's lots of people out here who have really interesting and varied backgrounds and some of them you know didn't start 

82.67 86.91 A: grad school until they were in their fifties and they i mean there's always 

86.70 89.28 B: that's true i mean you can always go back yeah 

89.00 90.68 A: i guess i mean they say high school is a 

91.02 92.80 A: the getting like the equivalency di- 

92.91 94.71 A: diploma isn't really all that

95.54 102.17 B: i don't know i did that i did that before my class graduated high school and i got a jo- i got a degree as a medical assistant but i wanted to be a doctor 

95.76 96.17 A: oh

100.62 101.03 A: uh-huh 

102.46 102.89 A: right 

103.17 103.93 B: you know or 

104.14 109.69 B: a scientist or something that i you know i never took physics i never because i dropped out in tenth grade so 

107.49 107.92 A: oh yeah 

109.24 110.01 A: yeah 

109.81 113.29 B: i i didn't do a lot of the things that i probably could have done 

113.74 114.18 A: yeah 

114.21 115.27 B: you know i could've uh 

115.75 118.26 B: who knows i could have found a cure for something or 

118.40 118.82 A: right 

118.79 119.27 B: you know 

118.91 119.26 A: yeah 

119.40 128.22 B: done something with with what i have instead of just sitting on it you know but you yo- everybody gets these talents in their life and you're supposed to invest them and 

123.19 123.62 A: mhm 

128.53 132.57 B: i don't think i've been investing mine i think i've been sitting on it 

132.92 135.06 A: yeah yeah 

134.07 135.67 B: all right what's your regret 

135.66 138.57 A: well i mean if if you're if you're happy 

139.27 144.12 A: in your current life as i mean maybe the not the you hav- you've missed out on certain uh 

144.62 148.98 A: uh things you could've done but they weren't necessarily more fun than 

148.27 150.67 B: yeah i probably wouldn't have started smoking cigarettes either 

150.76 151.27 A: mmm 

151.48 152.68 A: yeah well that's true 

152.11 154.28 B: cause it's thirty years later and i'm still smoking them 

154.59 155.97 A: oh oh that's too bad 

155.98 157.27 B: so if i could yeah 

156.07 158.26 A: yeah my my sister's always warning me not 

158.36 159.11 A: stay away from that 

159.16 159.68 B: oh yeah 

160.04 161.65 A: well let's see for me uh 

162.59 163.31 A: boy i mean it 

163.55 164.50 A: well i haven't really 

165.99 174.64 A: you know it certain cer- some things in my past are probably so embarrassing that i just blotted them out of my mind i don't even remember what i wanted to have not done or something but 

175.07 179.78 A: um maybe i'm kind of curious like like when i was in college like towards the end i just switched my 

180.51 184.52 A: my degree from physics to linguistics and 

185.79 186.79 A: and it was sort of 

187.20 189.22 A: eh i guess was it was mainly cause i was just 

189.43 199.09 A: sick and tired of the the difficult problem sets and i wasn't you know i could do them with difficulty but i wasn't stellar at them like some of my friends in the dorm or whatever were 

199.41 203.48 A: and so i and i really liked learning languages and stuff so i so i went on to 

203.99 209.62 A: do linguistics instead towards the end of college and still doing it now and i'm sort of real- i'm curious you know 

209.94 210.40 A: maybe 

211.32 214.45 A: what would what would i be doing now if i had stayed in physics you know would i be 

213.84 214.26 B: yeah 

214.81 217.70 A: you know craz- what kind of crazy job would i have 

217.87 218.91 A: now what kind 

217.96 221.84 B: (( )) working for the war department right now 

230.04 231.53 A: not that i necessarily want to 

231.84 234.21 A: devoted to what they'd have me do with it 

235.34 243.29 B: i could've picked up a few languages myself growin- u- in my house they spoked my mother spoke german with my grandmother and my father spoke polish 

240.38 240.80 A: uh-huh 

243.57 246.27 B: but i cou- i could understand the german but i can't speak it 

245.54 246.01 A: mhm 

246.63 247.16 A: yeah 

247.21 250.05 B: so they could speak you know the whole time and i'd know what they were talking about 

250.68 252.81 B: but i never you know i never learned 

250.75 251.35 A: right 

253.66 258.67 B: the second languages that were spoke in the house there's a lot of things i'd go back and change though 

255.97 256.46 A: mhm 

259.40 259.93 A: yeah 

259.99 262.71 B: and some things i wouldn't change though because the things that 

263.02 264.52 B: i did led me to 

265.03 266.03 B: where i am today 

266.54 267.02 A: yeah 

266.93 275.34 B: and to who i'm married to and to you know the church that i go to and there there's there's like so much that i wouldn't change because if those things didn't happen to me 

269.16 269.60 A: right 

275.94 277.22 B: i wouldn't be who i am 

277.89 278.37 A: yeah 

278.53 283.50 B: but smoking's one i would definitely go back and not do 

279.93 280.24 A: (( )) 

282.06 283.27 A: right right 

284.26 285.37 A: definitely 

284.77 286.71 B: especially at the price that they are today 

287.22 287.67 A: yeah 

288.41 289.06 A: i wonder 

288.48 288.88 B: uh 

289.97 294.35 A: i sort of sometimes won- debate you know if i hadn't gone to japan this past summer and 

294.54 298.48 A: and like look at japanese i could've had the money to like buy a car now and i'd 

298.71 304.21 A: you know have have a car but that sounds sort of shallow (( )) i have a feeling i 

304.47 305.32 A: better off 

305.50 307.23 A: without here anyway but uh 

308.81 309.19 A: it's 

308.83 309.21 B: yeah 

309.61 313.16 B: (( well )) other things i would say what else wouldn't i have done 

313.87 316.61 B: you have to go back and change things that you did right 

317.32 319.25 B: not change things that you didn't do 

319.11 325.71 A: well they're kind of the sa- one of the yeah i don't know it sounds like eh along the same lines uh 

326.10 326.71 A: i think 

326.81 329.55 B: i wouldn't have i would not have been as promiscuous as i was 

330.43 331.19 A: yeah 

331.11 334.59 B: because i wound up with an infection that i think impaired my fertility 

335.00 335.86 A: oh yeah 

335.99 336.82 A: well that's that's 

337.57 338.09 B: kids and 

338.31 338.70 A: right 

341.46 341.97 A: mhm 

341.68 343.01 B: or i (( and )) there's one 

343.55 345.12 B: when i had my gallbladder out 

343.68 344.06 A: yeah 

345.30 345.72 A: mhm 

345.76 348.59 B: i wish i would've known that they could have looked at other places 

349.41 349.98 A: oh 

350.07 357.48 B: because they didn't tell me till afterwards that they could've looked like you know this is a guy i'm talking too but they could've looked at my tubes and told me if there was something wrong 

357.58 362.80 B: while they had my while they were in there doing my gallbladder but i didn't know about that so i would change that definitely 

357.82 358.21 A: right 

359.71 360.25 A: right 

360.42 360.72 A: right 

362.88 363.43 A: sure 

363.65 365.01 B: cause then i would've known 

365.45 368.89 B: and maybe we could've fixed it before time was out you know 

365.54 365.97 A: uh-huh 

367.99 368.66 A: yeah 

369.37 370.39 A: yeah yeah 

370.17 370.76 B: um 

371.51 373.95 B: i would've been nicer to my mom and my dad 

374.41 375.19 A: mhm 

375.48 377.57 B: cause i didn't you know my dad died when i was nineteen 

377.84 378.50 A: oh okay 

382.43 383.51 A: yeah yeah 

385.29 389.67 A: yeah that's there's something i'd change i'd i'd i'd get to know my grandpa a lot better before 

390.05 392.63 A: i mean he's actually still alive he's ninety three though and you know he 

392.39 393.52 B: well then go do it 

394.02 398.23 B: (( )) my my aunt's ninety nine and lives with me and like 

395.03 395.56 A: not 

397.57 398.03 A: uh-huh 

398.54 399.71 B: she makes me crazy 

400.42 401.03 A: yeah 

400.67 403.49 B: but i'm glad i took took her to live with me you know 

403.12 403.62 A: right 

404.02 404.66 B: um 

406.09 410.85 B: she didn't need to go in to a nur- she's in a nursing home right now for ten days because i'm on my rested care like 

411.28 412.34 B: (( )) so i get a break 

412.41 412.82 A: mhm 

413.17 413.91 B: but um 

414.09 415.76 B: she's lived with us for five years and 

415.66 415.94 A: yeah 

416.42 420.51 B: yeah eh she's down hill but yeah all the stories and stuff that you learn from them 

421.00 423.47 B: and the history and it's amazing 

421.10 421.57 A: right 

422.07 422.59 A: yeah 

423.61 426.71 B: cause as they got older they only remember the stuff from long time ago 

426.79 427.69 A: right right 

427.26 428.61 B: they don't remember the current stuff 

428.55 428.91 A: yeah 

429.74 431.59 A: well i don't know i mea- my grandpa's not really 

432.33 436.80 A: he's not he's sort of not so friendly these days but he's he's a 

436.99 437.80 A: he's i mean 

438.04 441.39 A: we we sort of we went on a few trips with him back when i was little and stuff and 

441.62 442.28 A: definitely 

442.70 444.07 A: you know a familiar person 

444.47 448.03 A: in my life from from back then but i don't know i feel like i'm kind of at a 

449.00 450.59 A: stage in my life right now where i'm 

451.19 457.22 A: where if i if i don't you know work really hard on my own future it's going to slip away from me and it's sort of unfortunate but 

457.55 458.07 A: um 

458.63 459.58 A: you know i feel like 

460.47 462.07 A: and i and i'd like i'd like to 

463.43 467.36 A: to get to get to know some of these folks some of my other relatives like on my mom's side that 

467.55 472.37 A: my cousins and stuff and you know there's still time with them but still it's sort of like uh more like the kind of 

472.60 474.72 A: the kind of getting to know you get when you're real 

474.82 480.42 A: small when you're when when you're a child which luckily i had with a uh couple of cousins on my dad's side 

475.41 475.81 B: uh-huh 

480.93 481.75 A: um my uncles 

482.20 483.33 A: my dad's brothers uh 

484.23 485.20 A: kids they uh 

485.47 490.85 A: who live in minneapolis and we would go up there several times a year from when we were really really small and we had this great 

491.34 492.44 A: just childhood growing up 

492.94 497.49 A: together thing where you see these people a few times a year and you're growing up together and we're still um 

497.76 499.39 A: well one of them died unfortunately when i was 

499.54 500.28 A: seventeen but 

500.45 502.37 A: when he was seventeen i was sixteen but 

502.63 503.04 A: um 

503.27 503.88 A: we still got 

504.21 505.19 A: got the other one and 

505.65 506.04 A: still 

506.38 510.61 A: great buddies down there and stuff but didn't have that with my with a lot of my other cousins so 

510.32 510.70 B: yeah 

511.17 512.84 B: well see then you can't say there's always time 

511.30 511.79 A: (( )) 

513.62 515.00 B: cause there may not be always time 

514.49 519.11 A: right right well that's what i was thinking i was thinking there's time but it's not not really time to have what we had with 

516.11 516.50 B: yeah 

519.23 520.26 A: with my other cousins 

520.49 521.03 A: growing up 

520.49 524.57 B: and you you're not always just here for yourself and you know and your life 

525.12 526.50 B: you're here for other people too 

526.60 527.03 A: yeah 

527.60 529.88 B: like you were saying what you just said something like 

530.45 531.22 B: uh 

532.60 535.33 B: you need to worry about your own stuff now and your studies and 

535.74 536.16 A: right 

535.86 536.96 B: (( )) you know and like not 

537.32 540.92 B: having to go do that stuff now but you're not just here for yourself 

540.93 541.36 A: right 

541.02 542.81 B: you know 

542.18 544.00 A: well yeah well it's it's 

543.22 546.87 B: you're here for like cause like if one person dies it effects so many people 

546.87 547.34 A: mhm 

547.39 552.04 B: you know so your life touches so many others in so many different ways that 

550.03 550.49 A: yeah 

550.65 551.46 A: yeah well it's 

552.64 554.88 A: and it's it's possible to find a find a balan- 

555.42 562.16 A: i mean you're you're you're all busy and you know you're doing grad school and stuff and it's really intense and you're sort of expected to basically devote yourself to that but you know there's 

562.12 562.55 B: yeah 

562.63 564.85 A: (( )) it's still possible to get away and get a 

563.49 567.34 B: no i don't know i can't say yeah cause i didn't go 

565.94 569.45 A: it's still like like my mom's about to have back surgery and
