0.99 2.46 A: hello my name is tony 

3.57 4.77 B: hi my name is michael snyder 

5.68 9.54 A: um hi michael snyder um may i ask you a question 

9.58 9.92 B: sure 

10.39 19.28 A: what di- uh i was interesting he said or the initial thing i had cause i missed it i happened to be out would be hypothetical and time travel so 

19.38 26.66 A: instead that was an interesting topic whether time travel actually could take place and the physics of it et cetera but they've changed it 

27.37 28.44 A: to um 

29.16 32.08 B: if you could change if you could change anything in your life what would you change 

32.08 39.65 A: yeah that's dif- that i don't know that has anything to do with time travel you know what i mean that's just a setup for for that sort of thing 

40.06 40.78 B: yeah that's true 

40.13 41.99 A: anything in your life you could have changed 

43.41 44.30 A: um 

45.58 50.03 A: well i'll ask let um how do you first of all how do you feel about the question 

50.87 51.71 B: well uh uh 

52.37 53.00 B: i would think of 

53.16 58.90 B: sci- you know when i think of time travel i think of science fiction stuff like star trek star wars and things like that 

57.14 57.67 A: right 

59.00 61.75 B: uh if i could change anything if i could go back and change anything i'd 

61.93 62.40 B: i'd probably like 

63.48 65.14 B: go back in time and remember all that i had 

65.30 66.14 B: i've uh 

66.56 69.75 B: you know if i had the ability to go back in time i want to go back in time knowing what i know now 

70.37 74.59 B: as opposed to just going back in time and starting all over again cause that'd be that'd suck 

70.78 76.47 A: cau- cause otherwise we might go through the same stupid things again 

75.90 80.27 B: yeah or you'd make the same dumb choices who wants to make the same dumb choices 

76.85 77.38 A: yeah 

80.36 80.88 A: right 

80.80 83.98 B: i mean if i had the ability and talent i could do something different or 

84.10 87.36 B: you know i could change the way i think or meet different girls or 

87.77 89.65 B: you know i would know how they're thinking or 

88.46 91.73 A: or live in a different part of the country or choose a different career 

91.82 95.02 B: yeah or or you know i would i'm an elementary 

92.37 92.80 A: yeah 

95.17 97.73 B: teach uh teacher and i didn't know what i wanted to be 

97.89 98.68 B: it took me 

98.90 101.28 B: uh forever for me to figure out what i wanted to be 

101.02 101.54 A: that 

101.65 104.33 A: that's kind of exciting you're an elementary school teacher 

104.44 104.89 B: uh huh 

105.20 108.79 A: now i think that's kind of exciting w- w- may i ask what where in what state 

109.15 110.54 B: uh in california 

110.64 112.51 A: yeah okay well that's that's exciting 

112.84 113.36 B: yeah 

112.86 114.25 A: for how long have you been doing that 

114.50 122.64 B: uh six years so for me i'm thirty two it'd it would have been i would have rather gone directly into teaching rather than taking the stupid route i took you know 

117.46 117.85 A: right 

122.52 123.01 A: right 

123.02 123.91 B: forget the teaching 

124.16 124.91 A: i took 

124.47 124.91 B: so i 

125.14 126.44 A: took you a while to find 

126.92 128.04 B: yeah find my niche 

126.98 128.82 A: that that was what you liked best 

128.98 129.44 B: right 

129.87 130.53 A: yeah 

131.47 132.01 B: but um 

131.72 140.98 A: (( )) so you think mean if you off the top of your head you would have wished you would known sooner that this is something you would love to do 

139.19 139.63 B: yeah 

141.31 141.74 B: yeah 

141.85 142.29 B: i mean 

142.78 143.84 B: wouldn't wouldn't all of us 

144.56 145.24 A: yes 

145.38 147.66 B: i mean and not only that but you have uh 

148.13 151.17 B: you would know how to talk to a woman and not make the mistakes you've made 

151.62 153.24 B: you would know how to um 

153.59 157.00 B: you know articulate yourself in situations and for that matter know 

157.14 160.10 B: papers that you failed or tests you fail you'd know how to 

160.52 163.90 B: do it or pa- papers you know your teachers didn't read you'd know how to 

162.63 163.07 A: right 

164.28 166.64 B: uh circumvent your uh thinking 

166.92 170.50 B: so for me that would be the only way i would want to go back in time if i was able to go back in time 

170.00 170.38 A: in it 

170.70 177.01 A: (( )) interesting that you posed that and i thought about things some things that i wouldn't want to change 

177.40 183.16 A: that i would just live you know how much would i really want to change something maybe one or two really gross sort of things but you just 

183.56 185.35 A: put me into a different way of thinking 

185.68 187.13 A: of going back in time 

187.54 187.96 B: hm mhm 

187.58 188.95 A: and changing things 

189.12 192.59 A: um rather than changing like an event or a thing or a direction 

193.04 193.71 A: um 

195.50 198.52 A: i would wish more like a change in myself 

199.08 200.42 A: that um 

202.05 207.00 A: uh like a couple things i wish that when i was younger i 

207.39 208.51 A: was calmer 

208.96 210.39 A: and less impetuous 

211.35 212.59 A: and 

213.04 213.55 A: uh 

213.07 214.00 B: were you a wild child 

214.54 216.60 A: well n- i was just always 

216.95 217.34 A: like 

217.61 218.01 A: very 

218.27 219.67 A: hyper enthused in any 

219.77 223.02 A: in anything i did and i wish that i had been calmer 

223.30 223.79 A: and less 

223.97 226.71 A: and and less driven and reflected 

226.87 228.83 A: reflected more before i did things 

229.23 230.45 A: i find that um 

229.27 230.04 B: oh okay 

231.59 232.26 A: for the last 

232.40 233.55 A: ten or more years of my life 

233.88 236.41 A: i've really worked on being calmer the calmer i get 

236.86 238.96 A: the happier i am and the more successful i am 

239.34 240.86 A: so that would have been my change 

241.25 243.06 A: would have been mainly a- not not so much 

243.43 245.83 A: yeah i guess sort of couple gross 

245.94 249.37 A: dumb things i did in my life i would have change but i wish as a person 

249.61 252.13 A: i'd been a calmer and more mellow person 

252.85 256.93 A: and that's the thing di- is there anything i mean about your own self that you would 

256.61 258.25 B: i think for for myself if 

258.79 261.88 B: you know i wish i would i i didn't go out for sports and i and i was 

262.40 266.58 B: you know i had a lot of talent and i was s- strong and stuff but i didn't do it because i was insecure 

266.94 267.28 A: right 

267.05 269.44 B: i was afraid of what people were going to think so i 

269.55 270.54 B: i took the route of 

270.96 275.43 B: you know not going out for sports and what actually did try out for sports it was almost like it was too late 

276.10 276.78 B: you know what i'm saying 

277.18 279.10 B: um you know i went out my junior year 

279.32 286.37 B: and my senior year but he didn't they didn't really want want people they wanted people that had been doing it for their whole lives so 

286.90 298.81 A: well interesting you say that because the other thing not in sports but i wish i had been more uh more secure in myself i think part of the reason i was so driven was always trying to p- 

301.30 302.48 A: been more secure 

303.09 304.43 A: that's interesting you mention that 

305.28 307.43 B: eh yeah the whole but you know 

307.56 308.12 B: i mean if 

308.34 314.13 B: if if you have to go ba- if i have to go back in time i really don't want to go back in time because then i have to go through all the scars and the heartache 

314.88 318.84 B: you know i'm finally i've got things i i've got a career i know what i'm doing 

317.97 326.04 A: yeah dude yeah that's what i'm saying i'm not sure there'd be so much i'd change yeah i you know what we survived the growing up part pretty well and the changes 

326.52 326.93 B: yeah 

327.24 337.28 A: you know um and it's odd about going what would you be and to really reverse this what about going backwards um i have three cats right now do you have any pets 

328.11 328.43 B: how 

337.52 339.05 B: yeah i have a dog and a cat 

339.67 343.02 A: well it's really interesting for me to uh the first 

343.52 345.43 A: animal i ever remembered it was my first cat 

345.92 357.71 A: died a couple years ago and he was like twenty one years old and i have one that's now twenty five and people are just like oh it's so terrible to be around when your pet dies et cetera and actually it's been very good because it's taught me about 

364.32 369.04 A: that the cat lived a very good life with me and hopefully he'll go on to a higher life and i 

369.15 370.17 A: really 

370.64 378.57 A: they were talking in one direction of time travel like going you know what would you change and i'm i'm hoping to come back as a 

379.03 386.07 A: as a squirrel in a good park rather than a sea urchin so i i think i think it in both directions do you ever you know 

386.94 388.25 A: speaking of traveling the other way 

389.99 393.54 B: i i don't i don't i don't you mean religiously wise 

393.21 398.45 A: no not really well (( )) they were talking about time travel what if you could go back and change like in its like i 

398.58 400.26 A: i believe that uh 

400.72 406.10 A: we make may come back as a creature a thing a flower whatever and um 

406.69 409.22 A: when they when they say going backwards not only do i think of 

409.57 411.39 A: going backwards i think a lot of going forward 

409.96 414.06 B: y- you you think of it like the y- you're thinking of like the buddhis- buddhist concept 

413.30 413.84 A: right 

414.18 414.62 A: right 

415.08 415.40 B: right 

415.76 417.50 B: no i i personally don't believe in that 

417.56 417.97 A: yeah 

417.75 418.00 B: so 

418.54 418.91 B: that is 

418.89 422.32 A: i'm not i'm it's just a it's a it's a mellow thought in my life so it's like 

421.88 425.20 B: no no that's fine no no you're you're entitled to your opinion i'm not 

424.89 427.93 A: so i i put that in well um 

426.66 427.02 B: yeah 

428.03 431.94 A: it's it's been good talking to you did we use up their ten minutes i don't know if we have to use up their ten minutes 

432.37 433.87 B: i don't i know either so 

433.50 443.05 A: i this is (( )) this is the first conversation i've had but um i think it's gr- i think i think i what you do is great i think i find chil- the 

436.54 437.15 B: okay 

443.35 444.83 A: my ambition 

445.06 451.27 A: at some point was to teach and i may get to do that and i and i actually thought of becoming a substitute teacher part time but 

450.70 451.21 B: oh well 

451.52 452.62 B: good luck on the journey 

459.17 461.51 A: you can make such an impact and such a change 

462.64 464.54 A: so the the there's still hope that they're 

464.64 465.56 A: very fungible 

466.08 466.86 A: at that age 

467.35 467.67 A: hm 

468.15 470.80 B: you know and to go back in time would be fun is to go back and know 

471.15 472.89 B: like if you could buy into apple 

473.54 473.82 A: hm 

476.13 476.73 A: early 

479.61 485.72 B: you know they had the belmont stakes and they it was like seventy three to one and you could that and bet that or go back in time and take an atlas with you 

481.30 481.77 A: right 

485.97 486.28 A: (( )) 

486.11 487.54 B: you could make a killing financially 

487.05 490.90 A: eh and now let me ask you a question if you made all this money what would you do with all the money 

491.57 498.28 B: i think you know that's the funny thing i i'm pretty happy with what i do now so it's not like but i'm just saying if if you know money's not the 

494.65 495.53 A: yeah eh eh i 

497.57 498.23 A: yeah 

498.48 499.78 B: the epitome of all end 

499.84 509.54 A: well it's no but it's not you know it's not i think about that like you know still buy lottery tickets when they go big and what it did i i couldn't eat anymore i couldn't exercise anymore um 

500.24 501.70 B: that would be an interesting concept
