40.43 41.28 A: yeah and 

41.59 46.08 A: i think maybe that's something i would change because it was really small 

46.36 51.91 A: and it was just women and while it was really a unique experience um i didn't get to 

52.10 57.04 A: participate in like all the activities and stuff that a big university has to offer 

58.09 59.43 A: so like like sports 

59.59 61.38 A: and you know having like a 

61.59 68.52 A: affiliation with a team you know like a basketball team or something like that i don't really have that and i think you know it'd be fun 

68.72 70.11 A: it would have been fun to have that 

69.64 71.17 B: to have a gone to a big college 

71.76 75.72 A: yeah yeah big university that kind of thing maybe you know 

72.37 72.74 B: yeah 

75.92 80.16 B: i can see that some people they prefer like the you know the classes are probably smaller and the campus 

85.14 90.78 A: yeah yeah i mean i liked it because it was small and i did have classes that were like eight people 

91.05 93.26 A: you know in a class but i mean 

93.55 96.88 A: i i missed out on something that i think most people have 

97.76 100.78 A: you know if they've gone to school they've gone to a big school 

97.96 98.44 B: yeah 

102.21 103.77 A: so um i think that would be 

104.14 105.21 A: that would be it 

105.34 106.06 A: trying to think of 

105.71 106.00 B: uh

188.39 189.85 A: so what did you do

204.67 205.88 B: it was not a good situation 

206.42 208.36 A: oh wow that would certainly be something 

208.72 210.27 A: i could see why you'd want (( )) 

210.19 210.57 B: yeah 

210.99 216.50 B: yeah but i mean the you know the initial couple of weeks of the intoxication of falling in love and all that is is not to be um 

217.36 219.43 B: uh not to be missed in life but wow 

220.06 220.84 A: yeah 

220.40 221.17 B: what was i thinking 

221.82 226.80 A: well i mean it's easy to get caught up in it though you're right and then you know you think that 

227.28 230.46 A: you know best and you don't want to listen to other people 

228.44 228.92 B: hm mhm 

229.75 232.44 B: right you think everything will be fine she'll be so happy

238.51 239.74 A: how long ago was that 

239.93 242.18 B: uh let me see let me see that would have been uh 

251.16 253.93 A: but the that would be pretty significant 

253.86 255.14 B: oh yeah it was i was 

255.24 259.18 B: when she finally started going crazy i like i hid all the knives in the house and 

259.24 261.33 A: oh no 

259.78 260.34 B: you know 

260.90 262.24 B: you know it was really

282.55 282.99 B: hm mhm 

282.97 284.54 A: that was a better story than mine 

284.53 285.46 B: yeah 

285.63 286.56 B: yeah well it 

287.16 290.69 A: i don't think i have anything like that

297.95 298.28 B: yeah 

298.67 299.06 B: yeah

314.33 314.74 B: yeah 

315.07 318.12 A: especially she was from a noble family maybe you know 

318.24 322.51 B: yeah when she said my my village back in germany she meant her village i mean 

318.38 318.69 A: um 

322.40 323.50 A: oh good lord 

323.58 323.95 B: yeah 

324.54 325.19 A: yeah that 

325.41 327.38 B: and her her family yeah it was 

328.38 331.19 B: apparently like she was not on speaking terms with anybody in the family 

331.98 335.85 B: because her father she had die her her father had died when she was like ten 

336.10 336.70 A: uh huh 

336.50 342.18 B: and he had left her this inordinate amount of money like her and cut out some of her sisters and other people 

342.56 346.35 B: and they spent all their time trying to have her committed to a mental institution 

346.71 348.27 B: so they could take all of her property 

348.78 349.67 B: that he had left her 

348.93 349.35 A: oh 

349.88 350.86 A: my god 

350.87 355.25 B: yeah including her mother i mean her mother they were all you know conspiring to have her 

356.40 357.79 B: so she spent much of her time 

358.06 359.13 B: apparently in her twenties 

359.90 360.18 B: court 

360.51 362.91 B: trying to prove that she wasn't crazy even though she 

363.43 364.41 B: had you know like the 

365.08 365.96 B: she looked crazy 

366.19 368.52 A: i wonder if that's what drove her 

366.68 367.95 B: at that time she probably did 

368.81 369.77 A: to that 

368.82 370.06 B: oh yeah it was part of it yeah 

370.66 371.20 A: ah

379.39 380.90 A: and that's pretty personal 

381.48 382.49 A: that's pretty personal 

381.72 387.22 B: yeah well i figure why not you know it's not really about me you know it's not some horrible embarrassing thing that i did 

383.72 385.54 A: sure 

387.07 390.31 A: right right and it's not like i know even who you are 

390.19 390.58 B: try it

395.82 396.30 B: yeah 

397.14 400.23 A: let's see i'm trying to think if there's anything else that 

400.48 401.72 A: i mean i can think of 

402.35 402.98 A: um 

403.97 404.29 A: gosh 

404.48 407.97 A: i don't know um i i went to law school and i graduated and i just 

408.29 409.75 A: became a lawyer a couple years ago 

410.17 412.78 A: and i don't know if i would still go to law school 

413.15 413.71 B: hm mhm 

414.14 416.12 A: um i love being a lawyer 

416.45 417.35 A: but um 

417.49 418.73 A: just the student loan (( )) 

417.95 420.67 B: well what particular kind of law in anything in specific 

420.92 424.68 A: um i do bankruptcy law so i represent bankruptcy trustees 

425.54 425.89 B: yeah 

425.60 427.13 A: and um the bankruptcy court 

428.55 431.02 A: so um it's it's a little bit uh unique 

431.18 434.12 A: kind of experience because i don't represent the creditors or the debtors 

434.73 435.48 A: um 

435.71 436.73 A: some i'm kind of like gonna 

437.64 440.10 A: i don't know just it's a very unique position 

440.46 442.18 B: yeah and i imagine business is real good 

440.47 441.00 A: and i like 

442.32 444.50 A: right now it is particularly 

443.74 444.08 B: yeah 

444.70 448.27 A: yeah i mean the amount of bankruptcies that we're seeing and going through are just 

448.94 451.59 A: horrible i mean i'm in i'm just outside of l._a. 

452.38 453.08 A: so um 

453.33 454.59 A: it's a it's a pretty big 

454.72 455.57 A: busy practice 

455.70 462.76 A: but um yeah it's just it's just kind of daunting when i go get my statements from my lenders and i see i owe like 

463.05 465.20 A: you know twice as much as i'm earning 

465.25 465.60 B: hm 

465.95 468.31 A: it's it's frightening so i don't know if i would 

468.41 469.29 A: change that 

470.06 471.73 A: i know it's it's hard to say 

472.28 474.01 B: you owe who twice as much as you're earning 

474.17 476.98 A: oh the lenders for your for your student loans 

476.97 479.05 B: oh really you're still paying that off yeah 

477.57 478.45 A: for law school 

479.20 479.65 B: wow 

479.38 480.25 A: yeah law school's 

480.56 482.00 A: really expensive 

480.80 481.29 B: yeah i guess 

482.01 482.38 B: yeah 

483.21 484.03 A: so um 

484.14 485.84 B: so you'd if you time travel 

486.50 489.24 B: you would travel back and what tell your younger self to like 

489.77 490.13 B: artist 

491.62 494.58 A: maybe just um 

495.32 497.43 A: i don't know think twice about um 

497.72 501.93 A: being a lawyer just simply because of the amount of debt that you incur 

502.34 502.74 B: hm 

502.59 506.00 A: in in going to school cause it's it's hard to live like that 

506.46 508.61 A: after going through all that education 

509.20 513.29 B: yeah i mean you're for people in that kind of thing doctors and lawyers and stuff are supposed to live 

514.84 516.24 B: you know not supposed to be uh 

517.43 518.27 A: yeah it's funny because 

517.84 518.77 B: scrimping and saving 

518.99 529.51 A: yeah the perception is that we would live well because we're highly educated and we're supposed to be earning all this money but you know the the downside is that we all graduate with just this horrendous debt 

531.11 536.65 A: it is a scam you know i i talk to some people who are still in law school and they just think that they've been tricked 

537.20 538.21 A: into it 

537.63 541.41 B: well i have i have heard one thing i've heard about law school is that no other profession are people 

542.21 545.58 B: graduated with as little knowledge of how to actually do their job 

545.78 547.36 A: that's true as well 

547.57 549.76 A: yeah you you graduate and um 

547.65 547.98 B: that you 

550.04 551.63 A: you you haven't been taught 

552.07 554.80 A: you know the basics of how to do things 

555.00 557.26 A: um you've just been taught how to think 

558.03 563.26 A: which is you know it's it's a unique experience however like you graduate and you still don't know anything 

563.67 568.50 B: yeah i mean you i would think they'd start you you know basically filling out forms you know would be day one and then 

569.07 572.26 B: day two how to dress for court and how to you know talk to the 

572.70 574.13 B: jury and you know you know 

573.43 574.11 A: hm mhm 

574.43 579.98 A: yeah you would think that they would do something like that but they don't and it's kind of funny because 

580.62 581.25 A: um 

581.55 582.94 A: you know like we're saying it's like 

583.15 586.37 A: my my first job i didn't know i didn't have a clue 

586.68 587.14 B: hm mhm 

587.38 589.67 A: what i was doing and um you know it's it 

590.27 597.82 A: frustrating because you feel like you've just spent three years in school learning to be something that you don't quite have a grasp of yet 

598.83 599.61 A: so um
