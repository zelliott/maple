25.71 28.20 A: okay so do you want to start or [mn] 

27.99 42.79 B: oh yeah if i could go back in time well i had a daughter when i was sixteen and i love her and she's it's great having a daughter but if i could go back in time i think i would wait and have her later because it's well very stressful very hard to have a child that young 

44.11 51.35 B: so that's what i would do if i could go back in time and change anything but i mean if i could have the same daughter again just later 

49.66 56.68 A: yeah yeah huh so why why um do you are you raising your daughter by yourself 

56.45 70.66 B: um she she sees her dad on the weekends but mostly by m- i mean i have her during the week all by myself my mom help my parents helped me out when i was younger but when i turned eighteen i decided that i wanted to move and so it's just been me and her for the last year 

62.62 63.58 A: yeah 

70.70 74.11 A: yeah wow very good okay so 

74.19 84.05 A: what would i do if i could turn back time i think i probably would have listened to my parents a little bit more my parents always told me to 

84.11 96.56 A: save money you know no matter what even when i was a a clerk at a safeway supermarket you know they'd tell me put ten dollars a week away you know put any extra money that you have away in a bank account and 

92.84 93.92 B: (( [noise] )) 

96.50 101.49 A: used to tell me how well off i could be when i reach forty or fifty 

100.68 102.33 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

101.56 105.74 A: so unfortunately i didn't listen to my parents and um 

106.09 111.17 A: you know i have a full time job and i'm doing quite well but um 

111.39 115.57 A: i ah wish i would have listened to my parents and and done that 

115.59 119.42 A: you know it would have made things a lot easier because i have two little kids too i have a 

119.36 131.70 A: a six year old and an eight year old and things are rea- really expensive you know putting them ah in after care at school and in the summertime summer is so expensive if you 

121.89 123.03 B: oh really [mn] 

131.87 134.76 A: you know if you don't have someone at home to watch your kids 

134.80 135.92 B: yeah there 

135.96 144.55 A: you know we're paying eight hundred dollars per child to to you know to keep them occupied during the summer for the summer months and it's really hard 

139.10 140.34 B: [noise] 

144.54 153.77 B: [mn] my gosh my mom watches my daughter so it that cuts back on some expenses but it's still expensive to have a a kids 

153.81 157.29 B: buy clothes for them and all that stuff 

154.14 155.00 A: (( [mn] )) 

157.24 160.54 A: yeah well you know it's funny when you have one child you um 

160.88 168.13 A: you think well having a second child isn't going to be much more of an expense but you know when they start to get older it's fine when they're babies 

168.05 169.14 B: (( mhm )) 

168.14 177.28 A: and they're toddlers but when they get older and you have to ah feed them the same food that you're eating and you know you're you're paying 

177.31 179.57 A: paying ah double 

179.71 186.04 A: for everything you know we can't go to sizzler and and have them eat the salad bar for free we have to pay for them now 

186.03 187.70 B: (( [mn] )) 

186.10 195.36 A: so [laughter] so it does get expensive yeah yeah so what what else in the past would you change anything 

187.88 188.93 B: (( [laughter] )) 

195.53 196.50 B: (( um i )) 

197.22 201.98 B: think i'd probably listen to my parents too just just so i didn't give them such a headache when i was younger [mn] 

202.09 203.92 A: yeah actually i i was 

202.71 204.27 B: with my father 

204.38 209.90 A: i was pretty rebellious myself and i think i gave my ah my parents a very big headache 

209.59 210.70 B: (( [mn] )) 

210.06 216.42 A: you know it's funny you you think you know everything when you're growing up and you really know nothing and and i i 

212.98 214.43 B: (( yeah i did too [mn] )) 

216.48 229.28 A: i tell my six year old daughter all the time 'cause she you know she talks back quite a lot 'cos she thinks she knows everything and i have to keep reminding her you know alex you're six years old and i'm forty three 

227.02 227.86 B: [laughter] 

229.17 234.38 A: and i've been around a lot longer than you have you know and she says oh mom 

234.29 235.56 B: [noise] 

234.68 235.95 A: yeah it's funny 

236.23 242.05 B: i think that i don't know i think that i if i would have listened to my parents more then 

236.61 237.62 A: yeah 

242.06 248.53 B: i wouldn't have maybe i wouldn't have had my daughter so early and [sigh] i don't know things would have changed but 

248.99 252.07 B: everything worked out still good 

249.21 250.49 A: yeah 

251.71 255.16 A: yeah kids are great though they really are they you know it's 

254.99 267.93 A: i i look forward to seeing them everyday when i pick them up from school you know at the end of the day they are they're just so funny [noise] yeah but i'll tell you one one thing i would change probably if it wasn't for the kids i wouldn't have got married to my husband 

258.18 258.88 B: (( uh-huh )) 

267.34 268.93 B: oh oh

287.78 288.36 B: (( [noise] ))
