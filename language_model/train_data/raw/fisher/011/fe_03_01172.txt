12.67 13.44 B: [mn] 

13.61 15.33 A: well let me see 

16.06 17.74 A: have you thought this out 

18.15 24.11 B: um no not really [laughter] obviously the phone just rang about ten seconds ago 

20.15 25.39 A: [laughter] for a million dollars i gather if i never speak to my best friend again 

25.52 27.53 B: yeah a million bucks to 

26.83 32.47 A: well at my age i've lost a lot of good friend without any money involved 

32.24 33.76 B: yeah 

33.33 35.18 A: so for a million dollars 

35.26 38.39 A: i'm trying to think who's my best friend he's gone he's 

37.93 41.07 B: [laughter] yeah 

38.48 40.40 A: he's left me [laughter] 

40.43 43.20 A: my husband died he was my best friend 

42.63 45.05 B: yeah well that's too bad 

44.48 48.61 A: and i have a female pretty good friend but i really 

48.66 55.80 A: i don't have anybody that would worth a million dollars to me how's that i'll take the money 

52.92 53.86 B: yeah 

56.60 59.11 B: so what would you do with it do you think 

58.66 61.73 A: oh invest it my grandson's an a a broker 

61.58 67.17 B: oh there you go oh you yeah you'd have a ready made advisor then for that 

62.58 64.23 A: [laughter] 

66.58 67.72 A: it helps 

68.05 77.52 B: yeah i think i'd kind of be the same way because i really other than my wife which i think that wouldn't really count as a also as a best friend um 

75.77 77.45 A: oh yeah i hope so 

77.71 90.07 B: i'd you know i i tend not to have a whole lot of close friends i've got acquaintances i've got my family but outside of that i've just got a lot of good friends but you know are not necessarily anyone i would consider 

90.13 92.42 B: necessarily a best friend so 

92.19 95.51 A: i did have years ago but i ah not now 

93.37 94.23 B: yeah 

95.19 107.31 B: the same way when i was when i was growing up i certainly did i mean through school and stuff like that i had a you know i had a definite best friend for elementary school and then i moved to a different location and ah 

98.48 99.62 A: oh yeah 

106.34 107.77 A: (( that made you cry )) 

107.19 115.10 B: ended up then with another best friend all the way through high school um but really after that once i got into college and beyond i really 

110.58 111.22 A: (( mhm )) 

115.31 120.65 B: i don't know that i really have had a best friend necessarily too many times so 

120.89 123.30 B: so yeah i'd probably take the money too 

122.98 131.26 A: yeah well in ah in college ah particularly those friends are still very good friends of mine but they're not close to me 

129.82 130.59 B: (( mhm )) 

130.96 133.04 B: yeah well 

132.01 135.18 A: they've gone on they've had their family and so on 

134.17 144.29 B: mhm yeah that's pretty much the way i am too right after i got out of college there was a a couple i got married when i was in college and so did this other couple and 

144.06 152.82 B: and even after we got out of college the the four of us were ah we went over to their house or they came over to ours every friday night and we played cards and 

152.22 154.36 A: oh yes those were the good years 

152.73 165.02 B: we went out to movies together went on trips together and things like that but once they started having kids and then we started having kids of course then it becomes harder to visit because it's not just the two of you anymore 

156.32 157.40 A: mhm 

165.10 169.53 B: and plus then they moved to a different city as well so they 

169.64 174.37 B: you know it's just as you said over time you just tend to kind of drift apart so 

173.57 179.12 A: yeah yes i've ah now that they're all widows like i am i've contacted some of them 

177.20 178.07 B: (( mhm )) 

178.94 179.81 B: yeah 

179.19 185.05 A: and they ah we are very friendly and they remember of course it's nostalgic 

182.00 182.94 B: mhm 

183.57 184.55 B: mhm 

185.30 186.24 B: yeah 

185.48 188.08 A: but that's what it's all about i think 

187.75 189.58 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

188.29 191.71 A: you have to move on i'm probably the oldest one of the gang 

191.34 192.18 B: (( mm )) 

191.72 195.13 A: but i'm still the only one in good health [laughter] 

194.08 195.04 B: oh really 

195.11 197.01 B: well that's fortunate for you 

195.45 198.72 A: so i can't discuss illnesses with them i won't 

198.03 198.75 B: (( mm )) 

198.80 205.67 B: yeah you know that gets so depressing when when you do that so you may as well dwell on the good stuff not the bad 

201.00 202.64 A: yes mhm 

205.12 211.58 A: i signed for great satisfaction and money so the million dollars i could keep me busy for quite a while 

208.04 208.99 B: (( mhm )) 

210.99 213.25 B: sure sure yeah i 

212.46 217.70 A: i did have almost a million once but now i'm down to about a half [laughter] 

216.11 220.22 B: mm well that's you're certainly doing better than most people then 

220.42 223.27 A: well it's taken a life time you know 

220.82 221.55 B: (( ah )) 

222.83 237.81 B: yeah i know well i'm i'm in my mid forties and and still in that kind of accumulation phase so for me a million bucks would be very very welcome i had a i had almost half a million at one point but then 

227.12 228.34 A: (( oh yes )) 

233.76 236.87 A: yeah but you won't need a million when you're my age 

237.76 250.46 B: um went through a divorce which of course took quite a bit of it all oh yes it was very expensive and then also just with what the market has done over the last couple of years some of that has eroded as well so 

240.42 242.40 A: oh that's expensive [laughter] 

250.18 251.80 A: that's what's got me 

251.97 252.81 B: yeah 

252.10 255.61 A: although i do have a broker a gr- my only grandson

437.79 438.62 A: [laughter] 

439.36 442.71 A: you know that's so much better than i have a grand 

442.88 445.33 A: my nephew my only nephew 

446.03 448.23 A: forty six his first baby he 

448.13 449.88 B: (( mm [laughter] ))

451.48 452.40 A: (( grandfather )) 

452.74 454.86 A: [laughter] 

453.29 460.49 B: wow so but my dad actually wouldn't really wouldn't let my mom work you know he was of the old school that 

458.93 463.10 A: that's right i feel that way as a teacher i feel it's very important 

461.24 462.15 B: right 

462.62 476.01 B: right so that's you know so my mom never worked until my youngest but i'm the oldest of three and my youngest brother was probably in i don't know eighth or ninth grade before dad would even let her consider getting a part-time job so 

472.45 474.00 A: that's wonderful 

475.76 478.90 A: i've i it's only the it's a good way to go 

478.63 481.76 B: yeah so but i was fortunate 

480.06 483.97 A: i i'm in favor of of that i my children 

482.50 486.29 B: yeah well and i did the same thing my my ex and i when 

486.16 499.44 B: when we had our first child she stayed home and she stayed home we had two and ah she stayed home until the youngest one was and i think first or second grade you know full time in school she stayed home with them w- 

495.55 498.02 A: okay that's what i did 

498.38 505.40 A: that's what i did i i still say after teaching all those years a home life is number one 

505.03 507.36 B: mhm yeah 

506.68 512.47 A: and the men are too busy i mean they're they've got their mind full of stuff from working all day 

508.46 509.74 B: yeah 

512.71 516.59 A: ah this generation is different than they share everything 

516.21 517.56 B: yeah 

516.94 524.79 A: but ah my husband dan h- he came home he wanted to either rest or play tennis or play golf he didn't want to bother with kids 

522.42 523.25 B: (( mm )) 

524.51 525.86 B: yeah 

525.90 533.29 A: so he didn't really know them as people now my nephew at forty six the most wonderful thing that ever happened in his entire life 

532.92 535.70 B: mhm yeah 

533.49 534.86 A: was his baby 

535.06 537.40 A: years ago he would have drowned it 

537.28 543.98 B: yeah it is awfully like though like you say because i mean he's going to be retiring when the kid graduates from high school 

537.45 538.35 A: [laughter] 

543.37 544.75 A: oh yeah 

544.02 545.84 B: and that's just that 

544.95 550.69 A: but it's such a joy to him it means he spends all every second with her 

549.67 559.50 B: yeah well and that's good because he has the maturity to do that i mean that is one advantage of him having late in life is he has the maturity to realise how important that is 

550.78 553.07 A: he can't think of anything more more 

559.05 566.60 A: yeah well i have one daughter at nineteen i think she may be twenty she had her and i was so jealous because she played with her 

566.29 567.57 B: mhm 

567.09 572.00 A: on the floor and she i mean it she enjoyed her she didn't worry 

572.25 580.86 A: this guy is so worried all the time she's going to pick up some germs you can't wear any shoes in the house it's a nightmare i don't even like to go there 

574.52 575.25 B: (( mm )) 

576.71 578.57 B: mhm 

578.91 580.04 B: mhm 

580.79 581.52 B: (( oh )) 

581.31 586.30 A: well i might touch her my hands are probably where would where'd you stop on the way out here 

584.28 585.05 B: oh 

586.43 591.32 A: oh i w- why didn't you just tell me go and wash your hands [laughter] 

586.49 587.24 B: (( mm )) 

589.27 591.36 B: [laughter] yeah 

591.38 592.70 B: yeah 

592.18 595.50 A: it's it it's bad too you know either way 

594.66 597.12 B: (( mm yeah ))
