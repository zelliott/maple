83.98 84.74 B: (( oh )) 

90.15 91.29 B: exactly 

91.26 98.03 A: and ah so of course i carry a lot of guilt i would have i you know if i had the opportunity to 

98.68 101.38 A: to go back into time and change anything 

101.23 102.24 B: mhm 

101.53 103.68 A: you know it would be that [laughter] 

103.15 104.35 B: exactly 

103.70 107.23 A: you know i would not have um kicked him out 

107.24 116.86 A: um things would have been different if i knew that four months down the line he was going to not be here anymore well my goodness you know 

116.83 126.29 A: that's how i would have switched it you know if i am it's something that i really do wish i could do go back into time if if anything for that 

117.07 118.20 B: exactly 

122.20 123.27 B: exactly 

126.25 127.33 B: exactly 

127.71 128.78 B: okay 

127.77 128.96 A: your turn 

128.96 133.31 B: all right um one thing that i wish i could change actually 

133.56 137.54 B: is spending more time with my family in the past 

137.66 144.44 B: and the reason why i say that is because i'm like the oldest female and i'm only twenty two but 

145.53 153.30 B: my cousin vonnie um has eight children and she was on drugs and prostituting and now she has aids okay 

153.36 161.79 B: and all of her children are split up except one the grandmother was was able to adopt one girl 

162.21 168.52 B: and the rest of her kids have been adopted by other people but they've you know been affected 

168.54 175.28 B: by that and i feel that if i were able to if i had time for my family 

175.40 180.19 B: the girls who were like fifteen and sixteen and seventeen wouldn't have kids now 

180.44 181.53 B: you know 

181.04 183.06 A: (( right that's the way you think though )) 

183.14 184.02 B: (( huh )) 

183.63 185.20 A: that's the way you feel mhm 

185.01 199.29 B: exactly i mean i i know that i can't really you can't really predict when somebody will have a child you know but having a child at like fifteen or sixteen you're really not ready and it's more than just having a child it's having sex unprotected sex period 

199.07 207.88 A: so okay we get into this um this time capsule and you go back into that time so how how far was would that be 

209.07 212.14 B: ooh boy that would be about 

212.33 222.09 A: when you feel that you could have changed that it could have mattered you know that you what you did or what you would do would matter and would be a change and it you know 

221.94 228.86 A: all this that happened with them would not hap- how you know what time frame was that i mean how many years back would you go 

228.56 229.96 B: i would say seven 

229.66 231.26 A: seven years back 

230.40 238.27 B: yeah mhm because they were ignored you know all of my cousins were like pretty much ignored by everyone 

231.73 232.66 A: and 

238.71 244.72 B: so you know and and the poor cousins who really could not afford to take them in took them in 

244.89 251.02 A: well you know there was a a real movie you know a movie about h. g. wells who invi- invented the um 

251.31 256.01 A: you know the time the the time capsule that allowed you to go back into time right 

255.66 256.59 B: uh-huh 

256.13 258.35 A: and i don't know if you saw it but 

258.53 264.27 A: um there was a a detective sherlock holmes who was after the 

265.82 267.00 A: (( wait a minute )) 

267.07 279.77 A: i forgot how it went anyway what the gist of the story was that he really couldn't change time even though he went back or forward he whatever is going to happen 

279.81 281.87 A: is destined to happen you 

281.37 283.49 B: exactly i believe that 

282.84 293.21 A: know so that's you know i mean it's not it's a nice thought that to think about going back i mean i could even say that i wanted to go back into um the time when jesus walked the earth 

292.73 295.26 B: exactly exactly 

293.34 297.68 A: i would have loved to have met him and to right and to see 

295.38 296.52 B: (( me too )) 

297.80 303.84 A: how i would have responded would i would would i have been one of the people that said oh this guy is a lunatic 

303.89 305.02 B: exactly 

304.49 315.66 A: you know because here i think oh you know i believe in god and jesus as the lord and all of this but had i lived in those times would i have thought that he was some lunatic 

316.01 322.19 A: you know right or w- w- or would we have believed him and been one of his followers 

316.20 319.07 B: exactly exactly 

322.54 323.99 B: that's a good question 

323.02 323.58 A: (( [mn] )) 

323.59 335.89 A: you know i mean would you how would you knowing how you are and you took that time capsule back and you saw this guy walking around and saying that he's the son of god or doing all these miracles 

336.18 340.37 A: would you have continued to follow him out of curiosity or as a believer 

341.80 342.84 B: (( hm )) 

343.04 344.24 A: right 

343.37 345.75 B: goodness that's a good question yes 

345.47 346.74 A: mhm 

346.56 353.68 B: because you know they were really ridiculed back then for that you know the followers of jesus and things like that you had to really be a strong person 

349.69 350.57 A: yes 

353.27 354.36 A: that's right 

353.71 358.14 B: to have done that and really had believe and not just have been curious you know 

358.01 366.19 A: yeah i think that was a time when you know ah there was a lot of prejudice at you know prejudice stems a long long time back 

365.55 367.05 B: yes it does 

366.54 372.94 A: you know it it's never ended really they just kind of i feel that it's camouflaged now it's hidden 

373.06 374.14 A: but 

373.25 375.92 B: and there's something else i wish i could have changed because 

375.51 377.31 A: sure you know i mean 

376.68 378.14 B: i should say it 

377.53 383.58 A: how many people died how many slaves were lynched i live in florida now 

383.39 384.26 B: uh-huh 

383.86 387.26 A: and i i'm from new york though but 

387.32 391.43 A: every now in then i say geeze you know i can feel it i can 

390.82 391.90 B: exactly 

391.50 399.65 A: and i can see it but it's still alive and well in the south but then in new york it was still alive and well too 

396.12 397.34 B: exactly 

399.75 401.75 A: but b- living here 

402.31 408.09 A: makes me remember certain things that happened you know so 

405.95 407.54 B: mhm 

408.33 411.65 A: i mean of us going back in a time capsule 

411.85 414.13 A: could we really make a difference 

414.28 426.31 A: if all of us i mean if say fifty percent of the world had that chance to travel back in a time capsule and and travel back into time to these certain periods 

426.24 427.41 B: exactly 

426.43 428.75 A: could we have changed anything 

429.27 433.73 A: you know i mean i'd like to believe yeah knowing what we know now 

431.91 434.41 B: exactly exactly 

434.26 442.26 A: you know not just going back and being dropped off anywhere but knowing what we know now and experiencing what we've experienced 

442.42 444.26 A: i think we could 

444.04 447.50 B: right given the opportunity i probably think i would try you 

447.77 448.53 B: know 

448.36 450.92 A: would you leave what you have to go back 

451.03 455.23 A: if you couldn't take anybody else with you but yourself and what you know 

455.44 457.35 B: yeah i would 

457.70 461.60 A: i would too i'm um i'm an adventurer that way 

461.46 465.42 B: me too but this is also something that i've that i've thought about before you know 

465.68 466.87 A: to go back 

465.68 475.83 B: with all with that time machine movie that came out you know and i was wondering how we could actually how all that will come about and what i would actually do if i was in that situation 

468.36 470.00 A: mhm mhm 

475.63 477.13 A: i would love it 

476.91 478.19 B: exactly

496.30 497.67 B: exactly 

497.37 509.40 A: on the news and i mean how could i h- how could i change that if i took a you know if i took a time capsule back into time how could i change it if anything you know i mean would i stay in new york 

504.70 505.94 B: exactly 

509.50 515.17 A: would i try and warn people because i know about you know i'm going back with this knowledge 

514.73 515.81 B: exactly

531.06 532.38 A: who knows 

532.49 538.10 A: all of this because we live here and if we went we traveled backwards with all these answers 

534.50 535.99 B: mhm

541.86 544.20 B: exactly exactly 

542.72 548.76 A: you know the f._b._i. would have us or they'd stick us in a padded room

551.72 554.05 B: exactly exactly 

553.53 554.44 A: (( you know )) 

554.64 560.08 B: because you know americans i mean well people in general i think we like to be warned but i don't think we can handle it
