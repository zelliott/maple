5.76 8.83 B: i i say you heard the ah topic right

8.90 10.08 B: (( okay [laughter] )) 

9.50 11.49 A: [laughter] 

10.09 12.04 B: do you want to start or do you want me to 

11.67 13.58 A: ah well you can start it 

13.22 21.26 B: oh w- well if i guess if i was going to receive a million dollars and i could never talk to my best friend again i probably wouldn't accept it 

20.87 22.49 A: i don't think i would either 

22.10 25.57 B: it'd depend on what kind of terms my best friend [laughter] and i were on 

24.37 35.53 A: ah y- well y- y- well that too and right and there's kind of what what type of term we was on and and what kind of serious need i was in to have that million dollars 

34.35 39.69 B: that that's it that's true too but i mean as it stands now i don't think that you can 

39.90 47.78 B: i don't think you could take the money and would you be able to explain to your friend what happened [laughter] 'cause obviously you could never talk to them again so they would just 

44.90 45.90 A: no 

46.72 61.63 A: no ah right right i don't think i don't think i would because really i'm not that type of person but if i was in a circumstance where my ah family was in desperate need or a life and death thing i would have to 

52.16 53.16 B: right 

62.18 65.57 B: yeah yeah i well sure i can definitely do that 

63.54 69.76 A: but but if if it's just for the million dollars and everything was okay no i couldn't do it 

68.77 75.96 B: yeah i would i understand why i don't think like it's all like all those reality shows where they do things for the million dollars it's like i wouldn't do that for 

76.25 78.60 B: ah have you ever seen fear factor the 

77.99 79.44 A: yeah uh-huh 

78.89 83.42 B: like for fifty thousand some of the stuff they have to eat and some of i'm like you know i 

80.17 82.03 A: right 

83.27 91.25 A: [laughter] no i don't think i don't think it'd be that serious and and plus plus i don't think i could live with it 

84.03 85.26 B: (( that bad )) 

90.05 91.99 B: ye- i don't i ah 

92.57 98.25 B: what do i mean a friendship over like the course of years is so much more important than money 

96.28 99.73 A: (( mhm right )) 

98.26 103.53 B: the people who end up you know dying lonely with all of this money that they just leave to like some random 

103.19 105.26 A: right 

103.61 107.98 B: something like end up have living having had lived ah a much 

107.99 110.25 B: less fulfilled life i think than 

109.65 114.81 A: ah yeah and i think that i i would be happier with the money if i made it myself 

114.34 115.55 B: oh yeah definitely 

114.94 117.49 A: instead of somebody just giving it 

117.64 126.76 A: don't get me wrong if somebody just want to give it to me with no ah you know no ties i would ah i would deal with it but just to deal with it over someone who i 

119.49 120.90 B: [laughter] 

122.02 123.08 B: right 

126.57 133.36 A: a friend of mine who's like a brother or sister to me i don't i don't i couldn't 

128.21 129.18 B: [noise] 

130.08 131.25 B: yeah 

132.27 134.69 B: yeah no i don't think i could either 

134.05 141.18 A: i couldn't live with myself and and then it'll take over my spiritual beliefs and and then it'll take over ah 

138.63 139.76 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

141.52 142.59 A: (( ah )) 

142.84 145.22 A: you burning in hell for eternity 

144.51 147.81 B: [noise] yeah i would think that that would be something that's ah i 

148.27 151.39 B: mean that's definitely like greed and all the other 

152.13 153.99 A: (( [mn] [mn] yeah )) 

152.87 153.81 B: oh my 

154.62 155.18 A: (( [mn] )) 

154.88 157.19 B: i'm trying to fix my son lunch here so 

156.91 158.94 A: oh okay no problem 

157.65 159.55 B: [laughter] no you're fine 

159.75 160.63 B: but 

160.05 165.66 A: yeah but but really it would it would and and and then it would be like all although they say friends 

165.60 176.07 A: but it would be like ah like like you said when you just bought up fixing your son's lunch that's that that that'll be like someone telling you okay i'll give you a million dollars if you let me have your son 

175.39 181.05 B: ye- oh yeah ye like [laughter] i don't think i would ever even like that wouldn't even be a question 

176.47 178.62 A: [mn] you know [laughter] 

179.33 182.87 A: but uh-huh right right [mn] 

181.89 190.79 B: 'cause i mean i know the who the person who i consider my best friend now is we've definitely gone through times where we may not talk for months and it's not because we're mad we're just like our lives 

190.69 194.45 A: right right 

191.13 192.99 B: has pains and 

193.09 201.94 B: but at the same time like even even so i mean they could have caught me probably at one of those those times and i don't think i could have taken the money for that reason either i mean that's 

200.98 205.96 A: yeah yeah i my my best friend now um 

206.40 214.17 A: ah now is ah like a brother and ah he's my my cousin and he's my ah best friend he's like 

208.91 209.88 B: yeah 

214.39 228.74 A: there's nothing i wouldn't i would give for him ah a- and we've had our ups and downs like any other normal people quote unquote normal ah [laughter] but ah but i mean that's normal that that that's in life and ah 

216.60 217.91 B: that's right yeah 

221.09 221.88 B: (( yes )) 

223.86 225.14 B: [laughter] 

226.62 227.68 B: yeah 

228.81 233.83 A: mon- money doesn't mean as much as as the friendship or love that i have for someone 

232.81 234.36 B: oh that is very true 

235.27 237.23 A: i really think that it's a 

237.64 241.88 A: it's it's a very deep question but it's something that you have to think about sometimes 

241.28 244.79 B: yeah yeah i know my husband and i talk about it a lot as far as 

244.83 253.52 B: you know w- with we- we're well right now we're like a single income family i stay home with my son and stuff and we've had to make a lot of sacrifices with money wise and 

250.88 254.62 A: mhm right 

253.57 265.85 B: but at the same time like i don't think i mean i wouldn't trade the time that i have raising a baby with material things so to me like the money question it's something we've talked about quite a bit and 

258.12 261.67 A: right mhm 

261.78 264.34 A: right 

265.83 269.60 B: it's always been kind of in the forefront of our mind in in the respects that 

269.75 278.70 B: you know we made serious choices to forgo certain things our vacations or you know fancy cars in order to live a lifestyle that we wanted 

275.59 277.59 A: right 

278.76 290.00 A: mm and and and and and i think eventually if you work together towards something that eventually it'll happen if if if you have that faith and ah that that 

285.69 287.42 B: that's yeah oh sure 

290.09 303.29 A: back to belief in god i believe that god will give you anything that you want but he's not just going to give it to you he wants you to work for what you want and like ah in your your situation you working on trying to bring 

298.31 299.72 B: (( sure sure )) 

303.61 304.47 A: (( up )) 

304.49 305.34 A: (( a )) 

305.62 311.62 A: good kid in life and ah ah as long as you do that and you're husband's by your side 

306.30 307.85 B: (( that's right yeah )) 

311.74 313.35 A: then it's going to happen 

312.68 314.04 B: that's right 

313.97 321.91 A: yeah and and and dealing with my life i had to stop working ah early because of ah because i'm ill 

317.95 318.86 B: mhm 

321.62 322.53 B: oh 

322.29 329.41 A: and but ah i know that god is still healing and ah i believe one day i'll still be able to go back and teach again 

329.06 330.80 B: oh what what did you teach 

330.21 331.66 A: i taught special ed 

331.43 337.07 B: oh okay that's my best friend you just [laughter] that's so funny

343.46 345.11 A: and ah once ah 

345.34 349.11 A: everything is taken care of then ah i'll 

349.48 358.31 A: be rewarded if if if if i can't go back and do that then i can find something in the field and if i can't do that then then 

350.50 351.37 B: yeah

511.58 521.48 A: uh-huh and and and is is ah is it's really interesting that ah that that that they would do studies on such such such things as this because

561.94 562.99 B: oh yeah 

565.14 569.72 B: [mn] yeah well i i think situations like that tend to

574.99 576.94 A: right

579.83 581.75 A: right 

584.08 584.98 B: um 

585.01 589.27 B: hate in the world that we can't have it in our own i mean it's just too much 

588.84 591.74 A: right mhm 

589.34 593.85 B: it's too much to deal with and i i i i watched president bush speak last night and it was kind of 

594.11 599.89 B: like oh man you know here we are with a baby and a war starting and it's i was pregnant at the time when september
