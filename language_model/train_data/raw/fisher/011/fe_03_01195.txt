0.07 1.35 B: hello 

1.24 2.41 A: hi 

2.12 3.37 B: hi 

3.53 5.18 B: my name's tracy 

3.78 4.53 A: my 

5.06 6.89 A: hi my name's kate 

6.35 8.35 B: hi [laughter] pleased to meet you 

8.20 9.38 A: you too 

8.99 11.81 B: [laughter] so what do you think 

12.21 13.30 A: (( [laughter] um )) 

13.45 16.02 A: they said a million or a billion 

15.40 16.71 B: a million 

17.12 20.28 A: one million dollars to never talk to your best friend again 

20.43 23.91 B: yeah it's kinda tough i don't know 

23.94 27.78 B: i feel like it's really hard unless you really put yourself in the situation 

27.82 34.12 B: because i i mean if someone gets offered like a million dollars that's a lot of money that could set you up for a really long time 

35.67 37.51 A: yeah i 

36.50 37.43 B: [laughter] 

37.66 38.37 A: mm 

39.99 43.41 A: i'm trying to think if i had a million dollars 

43.67 45.53 B: like what you could do with it 

44.91 49.38 A: versus right versus the value of a lifelong friendship 

48.76 54.23 B: and but also like how long have you known the best friend for you know is it someone that you grew up with 

54.00 64.05 B: since you know your since birth or like is this someone that you know you just like got a new job and it's someone that you work with and you like all of a sudden became really close 

64.31 78.76 A: right well i think [mn] i i mean we can only personalize it to ourselves and i think if i were to pick okay so my best friend mine happens to be somebody who i've known since i was born our families are all 

78.77 86.37 A: my mom and her mom are best friends they grew up together that's why we're best friends spend holidays together she is 

82.74 83.78 B: right 

86.65 88.90 A: godmother of my son 

89.39 95.72 A: so like mine's unequivocally no i wouldn't take a million dollars to never talk to her again because 

95.89 100.66 A: i think in trading the value of what she's gonna bring to my life from now until 

99.16 99.97 B: mhm 

100.87 102.04 A: whenever 

102.11 102.98 B: yeah 

102.35 104.44 A: like it can't even be 

104.45 112.07 A: touched by a million dollars that's certainly not to say that i wouldn't be [laughter] extremely tempted um 

106.17 107.25 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

110.58 111.68 B: exactly 

112.17 117.01 A: because i think about you know how many talks we've had [mn] 

117.11 120.02 A: her and i about financial 

120.44 127.68 A: you know hardships in our own lives and how it would how nice it would be to have money that would take those away 

120.94 122.03 B: right 

127.22 129.07 B: right i mean it 

127.83 131.68 A: um how less stressful life would be [laughter] without 

131.06 135.24 B: but you're also assuming that if you have a million dollars that you'll be 

135.11 147.34 B: like happy after that but you know if you have a million dollars and you don't have your best friend then you know how happy are you really gonna be you're always i feel like you'll always be contemplating like if you made the right decision you know 

136.79 137.65 A: (( um right )) 

147.30 148.67 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

147.89 150.80 B: and like a million dollars can only last so long 

150.78 151.76 A: yeah 

151.84 165.06 A: i agree because you and you're giving up a known for an unknown and although you know everybody in the world would like to have a lot of money um you don't know what having a lot of money brings 

160.81 161.78 B: right 

164.54 165.58 B: exactly 

165.64 167.18 A: and i also think 

167.30 173.10 A: at least i know that really really good friends are not easy to come by 

172.85 173.65 B: (( yes [mn] )) 

173.20 177.71 A: and those that are going to stick with you through the thick and the thin and 

177.76 180.49 A: to have already found that 

179.58 180.97 B: (( mhm yes )) 

180.95 184.22 A: is a pretty i think big gift and if 

185.84 191.81 A: you never know what the money at- you know what that money is actually going to bring to your life is it going to bring 

191.95 198.32 A: i mean will it make my husband and i fight even more about [laughter] money and you know 

195.84 197.46 B: exactly 

197.77 200.74 B: no it's true because you have to think about every aspect 

200.64 202.23 A: right um 

201.12 204.37 B: and it might not make you happier to have all that money 

204.26 211.69 A: right and it's a total unknown as far as what would that actually do to my life the other part i think about is um 

212.73 214.05 A: that 

214.22 221.43 A: look i haven't ever given i probably won't ever give up the hope that perhaps i'll make that type of money 

221.60 222.94 A: (( [mn] on my own )) 

222.47 223.54 B: right 

223.25 228.75 A: you know i don't know [laughter] doing what maybe i'll invent something maybe i'll win the lottery maybe i'll 

227.94 228.98 B: (( right )) 

228.87 229.81 A: you know 

229.45 230.63 B: (( mhm )) 

230.01 242.10 A: get some job that ends up being the next president of a huge company [laughter] you know you never know so i always have a possibility that that might exist but i don't know if i could ever find a friend that would replace her 

233.97 235.62 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

241.67 249.42 B: exactly it's true i feel like everyone's always looking for quick money though you know not many people think about it like that 

249.68 253.40 B: i don't know i mean do you think that most people would take the million dollars true 

255.00 266.39 A: [sigh] i think it [mn] really depend on if you have somebody that you consider your best friend i think there's a lot of people in today's society who don't 

266.74 278.03 A: have someone that they necessarily consider with people in today's society people move a lot you know they don't live in the i mean i don't live in the same i've lived in at least twenty five towns 

272.90 274.00 B: mhm 

277.72 278.68 B: right 

278.14 289.38 A: and you know i don't have real deep roots and so to me to have somebody that i even know in this country from the birth is really important to me 

285.00 285.80 B: (( mhm )) 

288.96 290.34 B: yeah 

289.74 297.68 A: and i don't know ho- i don't know i mean i guess it depends on where you are in your life as far as your friendships if you're somebody who has a lot of friends 

297.03 298.33 B: mhm 

298.42 302.05 A: um you know and you're a very social person 

301.65 302.69 B: right 

302.09 311.93 A: and maybe you don't have one who you consider your best friend and losing one wouldn't necessarily make a huge difference in your life 

302.88 304.10 B: (( exactly )) 

311.33 316.14 B: right but then but if it's your best friend i feel like it will make a difference 

316.18 323.77 B: you know regardless if you have like a million friends you know like if you lose your best friend it will always make a difference even if you have a lot more 

316.19 317.06 A: yeah 

324.16 325.25 B: (( you know um )) 

325.27 326.19 A: yeah 

325.74 335.15 B: i don't know it's hard i've i've i'm i'm a very social person i have a lot of friends and i've been in situations like i've gone um abroad 

335.14 344.17 B: and for five months and i did not find any friends whatsoever that compare at all to the friends that i have at home 

344.11 354.74 B: and i guess like thinking about that i really don't think that i would take the money because i mean i'm also not really that much of a superficial person you know like i don't need a million dollars i'm happy 

344.12 345.16 A: mhm 

354.65 366.36 B: you know i'm content with you know what i have especially you know i just i really learned the value of a friendship you know if you have a million dollars and you don't have the companionship that you need then it really doesn't matter 

366.89 373.57 A: yeah i think to be yeah i think you're right on being alone and having money 

372.16 372.99 B: right 

373.36 374.21 B: (( exactly )) 

373.63 376.84 A: you know money could probably buy you friends but what do they really 

376.67 380.58 B: they wouldn't really be your friends exactly exactly i don't 

376.88 379.56 A: what are they really there for yeah 

380.94 384.45 B: know it's hard i've actually i've heard that about 

384.38 387.45 B: um i saw something on t._v. about um 

387.23 399.85 B: famous people and how they have entourages and how they pay for all their friends to um you know like go out for dinner and stuff and the reason that they do that is because they say like there's no point in having wealth if you can't share it with people you know 

399.90 404.76 B: there's no point in having all the money if you don't have anyone to share it with 

399.90 400.55 A: mm 

404.81 410.27 A: yeah i wonder if if that's it like if they or if they're just 

410.23 415.20 A: they because of the lifestyle that they lead they it has a really hard 

415.10 416.38 A: i've heard a lot of 

416.15 425.32 A: celebrities say it's really hard to figure out who your true friends are because when the money comes rolling in like oprah and like really wealthy people say 

422.43 423.39 B: right 

425.09 436.30 A: you know it's hard to figure out who your friends are usually it's the one that was there before they mone came rolling in because once the money's there you never know what the true motives of somebody hanging round you is 

429.06 429.99 B: right 

435.66 437.06 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

436.41 442.01 A: and certainly and i mean a million dollars wouldn't come close to putting you on that stature i mean 

441.83 442.84 B: (( mhm )) 

442.20 444.71 A: a million dollars today is not 

444.53 446.41 B: it's really not that much 

444.82 445.56 A: not 

446.00 449.89 A: right i mean not like i'd turn it down if somebody wanted to give it to me for free [laughter] 

447.86 448.98 B: [laughter] 

449.02 450.91 B: [laughter] 

449.97 451.09 A: (( but )) 

451.08 452.43 B: (( it's true )) 

451.10 452.52 A: you know i mean 

452.73 453.70 B: (( it's true m- )) 

453.02 454.31 A: it could 

453.72 467.16 B: most people that get money that quickly like say people that win the lottery end up just spending it ridiculously you know and today you never know you can invest it in the stock market and have nothing [laughter] you know you'll end up without the money and the best friend 

464.07 464.84 A: right 

465.00 465.78 A: (( right )) 

467.06 474.80 A: yes i mean you could get yourself out of debt buy a nice car buy a nice house and pretty m- and after taxes you've pretty much spent it [laughter] 

474.43 476.05 B: right so 

475.20 476.93 A: i mean you know 

476.46 486.98 B: yeah it's also i don't know it depends on age also i'm only twenty two so i don't really know what it's like to support myself i'm still kind of living with my parents 

481.66 482.54 A: okay 

486.83 487.74 A: yeah 

487.15 490.30 B: so i mean it's you know if you're like how old are you 

490.74 492.87 A: i'm almost thirty 

492.49 494.18 B: (( okay like )) 

493.26 497.31 A: and i'm married and i have one child a seventeen month old son 

497.13 498.76 B: oh 

497.50 503.09 A: so yeah it's prob- you're exactly right i mean it's a very different perspective of 

503.65 514.60 A: where you are in your life i mean like if my husband and i could get ourselves out of debt and simply live on what it was that we made we could live an extremely nice lifestyle 

514.04 515.30 B: right 

514.59 527.35 A: if we didn't you know if we weren't in debt and i mean a million dollars we could put money away for our son's education we could easily have another baby without h- you know concerning ourselves with finances um 

520.70 521.50 B: mm 

525.55 526.91 B: (( right it's )) 

527.44 529.55 A: but like i said i mean 

528.67 530.26 B: (( still not worth it )) 

529.69 534.27 A: the the actual person that i think of when somebody says your best friend 

533.49 534.61 B: (( mhm )) 

534.46 544.47 A: is so entwined in our lives that taking her out of it by not [laughter] speaking to her again first of all she'd never forgive me she probably wouldn't want to speak to me again either 

539.15 539.97 B: mm 

543.58 545.63 B: i know exactly 

545.31 550.65 A: i mean okay yeah i chose you over money or i chose money over you 

548.22 551.41 B: [laughter] the money over yeah 

550.80 553.58 A: that's not a very [mn] uplifting thing 

553.20 556.37 B: yeah and it doesn't say much about you as a person 

556.48 558.94 B: [laughter] if you're gonna do that you know 

558.76 559.63 A: (( no yeah )) 

559.55 560.67 B: (( so )) 

560.57 562.75 A: have you done this phone survey before 

562.38 564.47 B: no [laughter] 

563.62 565.55 A: i haven't either this is my first time 

564.74 567.28 B: oh it is okay 

565.85 569.02 A: yeah i don't know if we're just like supposed to keep talking 

568.63 570.92 B: i think that there's supposed to be like a beep 

571.40 572.13 A: (( oh )) 

571.78 574.36 B: um but have we been talking for ten minutes 

574.73 577.68 A: yeah 'cause my phone says eleven twenty five 

577.06 578.37 B: really 

577.77 580.16 A: eleven minutes and twenty five seconds yeah 

579.57 587.69 B: and they said um i think that we really only have to talk about the topic for eight minutes we're allowed to like introduce ourselves for two minutes 

587.77 588.99 B: [laughter] 

588.29 589.65 A: (( oh really oh we )) 

589.62 592.43 B: (( yeah i don't know do you think we're good )) 

591.10 594.11 A: did the int- we did the introduction at the end 

593.67 596.15 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

594.98 596.61 A: i have no idea 

596.55 597.81 B: um 

598.20 599.89 B: i don't know i don't even know what else
