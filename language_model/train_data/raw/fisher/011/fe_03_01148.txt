12.92 16.60 B: well if i could go back in time and redo one thing 

17.46 22.91 B: um i don't know i suppose i would stay in college because i went for only two years 

24.00 31.84 B: and i dropped out for financial reasons but i guess if i could change that i would try harder you know to stay in like for a scholarship or something 

32.99 35.48 B: so i think that would be mine 

36.04 41.03 A: um yeah i could probably go along with the same lines i only did like a semester 

40.81 41.72 B: really 

41.17 42.24 A: [laughter] 

41.89 43.56 B: [laughter] 

43.62 51.28 A: i had had gone to frontier decorating which i thought i had wanted to do and then i decided i didn't like it after one class and so i quit 

50.69 55.98 B: really i had kind of a similar situation i wanted to go for journalism 

56.02 67.71 B: um but then once i got there i realised that all i was attracted to was like the layout design part of it i didn't really have any interest in the real like reporting or [laughter] 

67.67 68.48 A: hm 

67.98 70.13 B: you know that kind of 

70.26 72.04 B: that part of it so 

72.55 74.99 B: you know i wasn't really sure what i wanted to do 

75.61 80.65 B: but i guess i had a it just got too much you know money wise 

80.43 81.49 A: right 

81.56 84.57 B: and i just decided to go into the workforce so 

84.75 93.84 A: yep same here i was already i already had one kid and then i got married and had more and so it just was easier not to do it 

93.24 98.63 B: yeah i know me too and now i'm actually finally looking to go back [laughter] 

99.57 101.68 A: i thought about it about a year ago

102.05 104.55 A: but so far i haven't done it yet 

103.93 110.47 B: mhm well my hometown has this like [mn] they're calling it an accelerated degree programme 

110.60 114.83 B: where they say if you have no college experience you can get a degree in two years 

114.64 115.42 A: hm 

115.00 118.13 B: so i'm thinking well with 

118.36 123.33 B: you know having almost two years then maybe i can finish it in less time 

122.70 123.85 A: (( right mhm )) 

123.41 128.47 B: and i'm going to go back for computers because that's kinda become my thing now so 

128.69 132.42 B: that will be really good money once i you know finish it 

132.95 135.24 B: i just think it's going to be really hard [laughter] 

136.21 139.64 B: probably a lot of maths and stuff 

137.15 137.95 A: yeah 

139.02 141.01 A: yeah maths is not my thing 

141.19 148.69 B: me neither [laughter] i mean i i do well at it i got level good a good b. student in math but i don't like it at all

169.19 170.52 A: mhm 

169.88 175.19 B: yeah i like to write too but i mean just ah talking to other students it was like 

175.58 182.18 B: well um you'd be woken up in the middle of the night to go report on some fire or something and i'm like no that's not what i want to do [laughter] 

183.20 190.35 A: yeah i i think it makes it di- it makes a big difference when you do something for fun and then when you actually start 

190.42 191.83 A: doing it for 

193.05 196.27 A: making the money and you're his livelihood 

196.08 197.67 B: mhm 

200.27 202.06 B: yeah that's true 

202.80 216.67 B: i mean i guess that i was going to turn chief for my highschool newspaper and i did ah you know like the desktop publishing part of it on a computer and that's what i really liked i still like doing that kind of stuff so hopefully i can keep that but 

218.11 222.76 B: writing yeah i was actually going to be an english major i toyed with that for a while 

222.37 223.89 A: mhm

227.72 229.69 A: highschool grade school 

229.65 232.59 B: i was thinking about highschool 

232.76 243.17 B: but then you know and i thought about it i'm like highschool classes are tough you know those kids can have a lot of attitude [laughter] [laughter] and they're really mean so 

236.72 237.79 A: mhm 

239.23 240.18 A: yes 

244.06 249.74 B: i'm like mm i don't know maybe college but then that idea kind've flew out the window too 

250.50 264.41 B: i actually i my minor was spanish and i am one class away from completing that with certification to teach but i don't know if i'll i probably will pursue that i guess since it's only one class 

255.97 256.74 A: hm 

261.98 263.08 A: (( mhm )) 

265.45 268.58 B: so if you went back are you still going to go for interior design

274.27 275.42 A: um 

275.83 279.83 A: i've toyed with either a travel agent or something with writing 

280.45 281.21 B: (( mm )) 

283.05 284.53 B: well 

284.60 287.82 B: travel agent that's kind of interesting i think 

287.23 289.66 A: yeah that seems like it would be neat 

289.39 292.82 B: yeah i worked in hotel reservations for a year and a half so 

293.49 295.47 B: it's an interesting field 

295.73 298.57 A: i work in a doctor's office right now so 

297.71 298.80 B: oh do you 

298.85 300.71 B: like the office 

300.40 302.28 A: yeah receptionist 

302.24 308.10 B: mm yeah that's what that was my last job was receptionist for a business though 

310.61 315.33 B: so i'm kinda tired of the you know entry level type stuff [laughter] 

314.24 315.64 A: mhm 

315.38 319.10 B: like if i don't finish my degree that's all i'm ever going to have 

318.83 320.18 A: right 

320.53 321.98 B: so 

324.98 327.14 B: but then again it's just me so 

327.41 331.99 B: it's not like i have a fam- husband or ch- children to think about like you do [laughter] 

331.11 332.29 A: mhm 

335.27 342.22 A: this wasn't quite what i when they said time travel i didn't think it was going to be your own life and actual experiences 

342.24 348.02 B: [laughter] i thought it was going to be like if you could go some place in the future or 

342.73 344.00 A: [laughter] 

346.88 352.07 A: that's what i thought too if you could either go in the past or the future where would you want to go [laughter] 

351.36 361.65 B: i didn't think you would actually have to talk to someone [laughter] i thought it was not that i mind talking to you you seem very nice but it's like i thought they were just going to record you talking you know [laughter] 

360.96 361.91 A: uh-huh 

361.67 364.69 B: or [laughter] it's kinda weird 

365.35 369.53 B: it's like don't we get paid for this what does it say like ten dollars a call or something 

369.13 370.37 A: yeah 

370.51 371.91 B: yeah 

371.57 374.53 A: yeah i figured it sounded like an easy ten dollars 

374.00 377.95 B: so yeah that's what i thought too i'm like well i need money right now so [laughter] 

375.28 375.99 A: [laughter] 

379.00 381.92 B: i actually did you get the one about the soup 

382.28 392.22 B: i got another one that was like if you agreed to be on a conference call talking about soups [laughter] then we'll pay you twenty dollars and i agreed to it but i never got any more 

382.50 383.45 A: no 

392.12 394.55 A: no this was the first one i got 

393.69 400.09 B: [laughter] i never got any more information so i guess i missed that one 

399.90 400.68 A: (( hm )) 

402.33 405.60 B: yeah i get this kinda stuff all the time and i'm like ah i don't know 

407.84 410.74 A: figured i'd see if it actually worked out or not
