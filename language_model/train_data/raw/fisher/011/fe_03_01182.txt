13.66 18.19 B: well no way for a million dollars would i give up my best friend how about you 

18.55 23.13 A: i really don't think so that would be a really hard thing to do 

23.22 26.75 B: i talk to my my best friend every day i mean to just 

23.70 23.95 A: (( )) 

26.92 27.83 B: cut all ties 

28.35 30.83 B: i don't think i would do it for a billion dollars 

31.96 34.32 A: and it would be fun to have somebody to share it with 

34.44 34.72 A: too 

34.90 38.55 B: yeah exactly i mean not that i couldn't use the million dollars of course but 

38.79 39.39 A: so could i 

39.81 42.35 B: i know huh 

42.01 43.30 A: i mean honestly who couldn't 

43.28 46.64 B: yeah oh definitely i well i tried to think about that what 

46.74 48.00 B: you know could i really 

48.65 52.94 B: a million dollars that's a lot of money i could do a lot of things with it but could i really cut off all ties 

53.16 54.91 B: you know to that person forever 

55.90 58.19 B: and there's i just don't think that there's any way 

58.52 59.20 B: to do that 

60.42 62.10 A: well maybe there is a stipulation though 

62.72 63.73 A: -cause they say that you can never 

63.95 65.35 A: speak to your best friend 

65.45 68.23 B: oh that's true 

66.98 71.50 A: i'm wondering if writing and talking over the internet counts 

71.62 75.87 B: i know huh that's good there's a way to get around it i didn't call her 

76.00 77.12 B: we didn't speak 

76.21 76.62 A: (( because )) 

77.43 80.21 A: yeah me and my best friend we talk over the internet every day 

80.51 82.06 B: oh do you are you guys far away 

81.01 84.29 A: over instant messaging well we're close together but 

84.85 86.99 A: just we're always on the internet anyway 

87.02 88.53 B: oh it's just faster that way and 

88.37 88.99 A: yeah 

88.76 89.33 B: cheaper 

89.24 90.19 A: yeah 

90.67 95.47 A: and usually i'm since i work from home i'm working and kind a talking to her at the same time 

95.01 97.74 B: the same time yeah we do that too but on the phone 

98.01 106.82 B: i don't fast type enough to keep up with her she is a transcriptionist so she is like da da da da da she'd be sitting there for seven days waiting for me to type it back you know 

101.33 102.42 A: oh (( wow )) 

106.00 107.25 A: that's what she says about me 

107.57 109.99 B: oh really she is like you take 

108.64 110.62 A: yeah -cause i do document coding 

110.91 112.19 B: you take forever 

112.35 113.39 B: or you type too fast 

113.46 114.35 A: i type too fast 

114.28 125.14 B: you type too fast oh you code the documents well that's that's would be a problem then huh she is like going okay and you are sitting there going okay are you ever going to like type back here ha so 

116.53 116.80 A: (( )) 

123.11 123.42 A: yup 

124.15 125.50 A: that's pretty much how it (( goes )) 

125.49 128.39 B: a million dollars oh what's that 

125.76 126.65 A: but i wonder i- 

126.78 127.87 A: if that would count 

128.11 129.21 A: i wonder if that would count 

129.58 134.75 B: i don't know probably not you know they would probably would say nope that's communication that's that 

134.93 144.04 B: that doesn't uh prevent you from you know i mean that does prevent you from the million dollars because it's a method of communication 

143.02 144.07 A: that's a lot of money 

144.24 144.67 B: i know 

145.53 149.13 B: too bad they didn't say you could never see them again you know you could just close your eyes 

149.39 150.30 B: and blind fold 

150.64 152.68 A: i think i would have to get a lawyer on that one 

153.02 153.76 B: i know huh 

154.10 156.79 B: anonymous benefactor but what kind of person would do that 

157.30 163.90 B: you know i mean what kind of sick human being would be like okay i'm going to give you a million dollars but you could never ever see your friend again i mean that had to be a pretty 

162.98 163.23 A: hm 

164.52 166.26 B: depraved individual i think 

166.94 167.48 A: maybe 

167.67 170.11 A: but there are a lot of weird things on t._v. now so 

167.71 168.76 B: you know if 

170.27 174.23 B: i know but if you had a million dollars to give somebody i mean that would be a pretty cruel 

174.86 175.40 B: condition 

176.28 176.62 A: hm 

176.31 176.71 B: you know 

177.57 179.73 B: but yeah people do do a lot of things for money huh 

177.58 178.00 A: yeah 

180.03 180.42 A: yup 

180.10 182.32 B: the reality shows 

182.09 183.05 A: that's what i was thinking 

183.16 184.79 B: have you seen the new one um 

184.95 185.69 B: the way the 

186.46 189.80 B: they are going to give away a million dollars but it's the servants that are evaluating them 

190.33 191.66 B: do you guys have fox out there 

192.10 193.29 A: oh um 

193.56 194.83 A: i forgot the name of the show 

195.11 195.61 B: yeah 

195.68 197.01 A: where it's like a family 

195.72 196.00 B: but it's 

196.79 199.53 B: it's a family and they are all competing for this inheritance 

197.94 198.67 A: yeah 

200.28 202.70 B: and it's the servants that are evaluating them 

202.81 204.95 B: i can't wait to see the end of that i think that will be a 

205.15 209.74 A: only watched one show and then i forgot all about it because i don't remember what day it comes on or anything 

209.77 213.34 B: i've only seen it a couple of times too but every time i start laughing -cause you know 

213.91 219.56 B: it's the people who you who serve you if you were judged by them what would the verdict be i think that's an interesting 

220.34 220.90 B: topic 

221.04 221.79 A: (( it will be good )) 

221.65 223.85 B: how we how we treat people 

224.09 224.47 B: you know 

224.97 225.46 B: really 

225.65 230.14 B: reflects on who we are and there's a lot of people that have money that don't you know 

230.31 232.15 B: don't reflect at all about how they treat people 

232.82 233.10 A: yeah 

233.42 234.96 B: (( )) 

234.46 236.90 A: i never saw the ending of the joe millionaire (( thing )) 

236.93 239.41 B: oh really now i saw that 

238.15 241.80 A: i saw it when he picked the girl but i didn't see the one after that 

242.83 244.54 B: um no i didn't see that one either 

245.04 246.82 B: but i didn't think they would last too long i thought 

247.11 250.85 B: he she was a little too smart for him 

249.03 249.48 A: yeah 

250.37 253.10 A: -cause i had already seen something i think it was on good day live 

253.21 257.21 A: they were saying that they had already broken up and that was before the show was even half way over 

257.47 258.18 B: oh really 

258.85 262.61 B: talk about keeping it a secret huh 

260.61 261.18 A: really 

261.65 264.45 A: so i was like oh well i know either way 

264.73 269.65 B: i know i know the end i want to i'm glad he picked her though i thought was pretty cool 

264.81 266.39 A: but i still want to see who he picked 

269.80 273.74 A: yeah i was hoping he would pick her but my husband was like well why 

270.40 271.29 B: -cause the other girl 

274.06 275.01 A: because i liked her 

275.22 276.40 B: right because she was 

275.29 279.30 A: and he was like well why would you want him to pick her if you like her then he is tricking her you know 

279.51 281.43 B: yeah but i mean i thought that that was 

281.73 285.60 B: you know she would be the only one that understood -cause the other lady didn't care at all about him just 

285.75 287.93 B: just the money show me the money 

288.70 290.70 B: how much money do they give to the survivors now 

291.53 292.42 A: i don't even know 

292.59 294.83 B: i i don't know either i go to school that night so 

295.78 296.62 B: i never get to watch it 

297.61 298.45 A: oh you are at school 

297.65 298.51 B: but i thought i think 

298.70 300.13 B: i think it was more than yeah 

300.44 302.35 B: more than a million dollars isn't it that the 

302.53 303.67 B: final survivor gets 

304.04 305.68 A: i think so i can't remember 

306.15 307.26 B: yeah i don't know 

307.49 308.14 A: not really 

309.17 310.78 A: but i've never really watched that show 

311.89 312.45 B: oh i think it's 

311.90 313.09 A: just for like once or twice 

313.10 319.66 B: i think it's funny i mean if you like follow it from the beginning to see how people lie and cheat and scheme 

321.11 323.25 B: i don't know human human nature is interesting to me 

326.30 327.73 A: i wonder if we're supposed to be on the whole 

327.92 328.55 A: (( )) topic 

329.44 330.34 B: yeah i think so 

330.43 331.12 A: okay 

330.45 330.73 B: the 

330.87 333.63 B: same one so so tell me about your best friend 

334.20 334.78 A: um 

334.95 337.28 A: well we've known each other for 

337.93 339.75 A: oh gosh it's been like ten years 

340.58 341.08 A: we met 

341.22 342.03 A: at um 

343.15 345.28 A: a job that i was working telemarketing 

345.50 346.64 A: right after high school 

346.87 348.97 B: hm that is a terrible job i did that too 

349.17 349.94 A: it's awful 

349.91 350.28 B: hm 

350.13 350.43 A: huh 

350.54 352.34 A: especially that one we were doing the um 

352.70 353.82 A: political surveys 

354.00 354.78 B: oh gosh 

354.82 356.51 A: they would take like thirty minutes 

355.13 356.28 B: i was trying to sell people 

357.59 358.64 B: oh my god 

359.29 363.00 B: that's terrible i had to did a political survey once but i used to sell home loans 

363.11 363.95 B: re financing 

364.30 365.25 A: oh see that's better 

365.30 366.06 B: that eh oh oh 

365.48 367.15 A: i did that before too 

366.81 372.30 B: well i don't know i think it was worse i would rather be asking people for their opinions than asking them to spend their money 

371.80 375.05 A: uh -cause they don't make you mad with the surveys the political ones 

375.26 376.08 B: mhm 

375.65 381.35 A: -cause they would take so long and you'll get down to like the last five questions and then the person would be like look i really have to go i'm cooking dinner 

381.64 384.05 B: and you are like but i just have five questions 

382.07 385.34 A: and if you don't get those question if you don't get those questions you 

385.74 386.92 A: the whole thing doesn't count 

387.04 390.11 B: uh yeah that would be frustrating that would be frustrating 

387.72 388.56 A: so you toss it out 

390.44 391.60 A: so that's your bonus 

391.81 394.16 B: i think it's just hard to call people at home and interrupt them 

394.44 395.69 A: i know i really hate that 

394.89 395.48 B: and be like 

395.61 396.40 B: you know that's 

396.53 397.22 B: that's a bummer 

397.54 398.52 A: i'd rather call a business 

397.60 399.89 B: so how how many years did you say you guys have been friends 

400.07 401.13 A: um ten years

430.39 430.75 A: yeah 

431.13 432.18 B: it kind of goes back to that
