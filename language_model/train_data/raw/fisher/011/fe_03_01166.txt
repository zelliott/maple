4.40 6.48 B: i'm doing great nancy how are you 

6.03 7.58 A: uh-huh i'm doing fine 

8.90 10.23 B: okay 

10.27 12.24 B: you want to go first 

11.93 13.38 A: um 

13.77 15.15 A: i can try 

15.07 18.20 B: yeah i'm stalling i'm trying to having to think about this a little bit 

18.05 23.42 A: okay the question was if we could go back in time what would we change 

18.28 19.82 B: (( why don't you go ahead )) 

23.93 31.19 A: well i think that um possibly i would change some of my 

31.24 37.58 A: living habits and ah some of the boyfriends that i i might have gone with 

37.62 38.64 B: mhm 

38.01 41.84 A: um [mn] some of the actions that maybe that i had taken 

42.01 44.70 A: what do you think what's your opinion on that 

44.43 50.27 B: well i think in retrospect what i would have done i think i would have um 

51.61 56.57 B: i ah i left college to ah pursue a music career 

56.96 59.64 B: and what i should have done is 

59.67 63.02 B: i had two and a half years in and i was doing fine 

62.94 74.91 B: and what i should have done was put off what i did for a year and a half finished up my degree and then pursued what i did because finishing the deg- degree later on was really a difficult challenge 

74.37 76.09 A: yeah yeah 

76.20 84.43 A: i see what you're saying there well i know that i went ahead and finished school you know and i always said you know that i would finish school 

81.69 82.68 B: right 

84.66 92.04 A: but ah i i didn't have any thoughts of going to college because i didn't have the money to go you know 

91.36 92.79 B: right 

92.08 94.24 A: (( but ah i'd ah )) 

94.51 98.98 A: i'd have probably studied harder in school while i was there 

99.21 105.74 A: because i think back to some of the times that you know i coulda used some of the stuff that maybe i didn't study hard enough on 

105.95 108.07 B: right well i 

106.87 108.59 A: how were you in school 

109.01 111.46 B: what how was i 

110.20 112.39 A: how were you in in high school 

112.11 117.12 B: well i was really i was really good at school um but um 

114.67 115.71 A: uh-huh 

117.43 119.85 B: i had a opportunity um 

119.93 127.64 B: i was either see i had i had even skipped ah first grade 'cause i i was reading seventh grade level in kindergarten 

127.55 129.16 A: hey that sounds good 

128.15 138.05 B: and it's a long long story how that happened but i was raised in a in a rural area and we didn't have anything to wasn't a whole lot of neighbors and so 

138.16 142.81 B: my older brother would come home and we'd play school and he would just teach me what the teacher taught him 

142.42 143.74 A: right 

143.12 150.66 B: and and ah what the deficit the the downside of that was is that by the time i went to school i was kind of a 

150.75 158.33 B: kind of an odd ball you know so they didn't really know exactly how to deal with it but but i think like i said had ah 

152.11 152.97 A: (( mm )) 

154.45 155.49 A: right 

159.05 166.65 B: had i ah had the wisdom really to take good counsel i would have stuck it out for the other year and a half 

166.31 167.23 A: mhm 

166.50 179.52 B: and finished up my my music degree at that time 'cause i was i was considering going to college for medicine but i ended up going for music instead and um i would have finished it up then and that would have made 

179.32 185.38 B: that that one decision would have made a lot of things ah simpler and better in my life 

184.79 186.56 A: right right 

186.59 188.19 A: (( well ah )) 

188.38 198.45 A: like i said i didn't pursue college i didn't think you know that that i wanted to go but i i did go later after i was married and and i should have studied harder 

198.31 207.07 A: in college but you know i i had other thin- i had a child and so i had to quit and take care of my child you know 

205.06 206.20 B: right 

207.20 208.54 A: and um 

209.64 210.58 A: well 

211.58 216.31 A: ah money situation there too but i wanted my husband you know to go on to college too 

216.44 218.12 B: right right 

217.48 231.80 A: [laughter] you know there was things you know you you you would say well okay you go ahead and do this you know because he already had a degree and he wanted to go and get his masters degree and i thought well that was more important than me going to school too 

232.50 235.84 B: well sometimes we don't really consider ah 

236.14 245.18 B: you know in a in an attempt to be kind and gracious sometimes really what's important to us gets put to the side 

244.58 247.07 A: yeah that's true that's true 

247.21 249.03 A: uh-huh um 

250.24 254.22 A: and this the the time machine you know ah 

254.21 263.06 A: when when it was first brought up i i i was thinking of the movie about a time machine that this guy goes back in time 

263.02 270.21 A: you know he gets in the machine and [mn] goes back in time and i was thinking well how can you do that you know you really can't go back in time 

270.10 282.09 A: you know what you do back in the past you know it's it's past you you can't go back and and collect that and say hey i'm going to do it over if we could you know we might be going back in in time 

282.09 293.98 A: every time we turned around and i don't think that ah god meant for us to do that you know we're supposed to go forward and learn by our mistakes that we have done in the past 

294.01 300.90 B: yeah i i i totally agree with that i totally agree with that but and the other thing is that the 

302.37 309.94 B: the the way that we were thinking at that time if if if i know if i went back to when i was fifteen or sixteen 

310.03 314.48 B: i would probably still make some of the some of the dumb choices that i made then 

313.07 314.21 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

314.50 319.28 B: and the reason why is even knowing what i know now if i went back then 

319.31 332.65 B: i would still be thinking like a fifteen or sixteen or eighteen year old and all of a sudden those same things it would make sense to me all over again i used to think well that's still probably the best choice i could make you know 

331.75 335.70 A: well yeah yeah that- that's true too you know 

335.90 350.10 A: a- you know i don't know why people are always saying well if you could go back and change something what would you change you know well you you got to think that if if if you go back you're you're still thinking the same way 

350.09 358.09 A: you know i mean you- you'd still make the same old dumb mistakes and say the same thing over again i mean 

350.23 351.61 B: right 

358.18 361.06 A: [laughter] we can't go back and undo it 

361.17 362.13 A: you know 

361.57 365.79 B: well i i i think that you know that 

365.67 378.34 B: um sometimes when it looks like a mistake or a failure can actually you know work out to the good you know it it can actually have been for our good even really unfortunate situations at times you know 

371.20 372.11 A: right 

377.46 380.71 A: yeah yeah we learn from our mistakes 

378.55 379.53 B: um 

380.49 382.16 B: right 

382.11 383.49 A: (( so [mn] )) 

383.49 393.08 A: you know i i i think that ah the mistakes that i had made i've i've learned from them and i've even ah tried to teach my children 

393.04 398.99 A: you know to l- to learn from my own mistakes but i think sometimes 

397.78 399.83 B: how successful has that been 

399.79 400.81 A: the what 

400.58 402.71 B: how successful has that been 

403.07 404.23 A: um 

404.66 407.58 A: i don't think very very successful 

407.28 410.24 B: well probably about as successful as you know [mn] 

409.39 411.66 A: as our parents tried to teach us 

411.45 413.77 B: absolutely absolutely 

412.23 415.10 A: yeah yeah you know you you you tell them 

415.00 428.33 A: but but they've got a mind of their own to be able to you know they have a choice you know god gave us a choice and and they've got a choice so you know [mn] we just we just can't we can't live 

420.79 421.77 B: right 

428.45 431.22 A: and and say for what our kids would do 

431.32 442.56 A: because you know they're going to do they've got a mind of their own like we had a mind of our own and we did exactly probably the opposite of what we were told not to do 

442.74 449.42 A: and our kids have done the same thing it's just like history history repeats itself so you know 

448.44 453.52 B: i i i yeah i agree well the the the thing the thing that ah 

450.43 451.40 A: [laughter] 

453.52 463.94 B: i think on my part that the only difference i- i've tried to make was to really maintain a better relationship with my children than 

464.11 469.86 B: probably my dad and my mom did where where as at least um i have 

465.94 467.62 A: right yeah 

470.33 475.02 B: you know i've tried to maintain a place where i at least have a platform to speak into their lives 

474.50 476.07 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

475.32 476.55 B: to where 

476.89 478.43 B: you know um 

478.49 484.28 B: i was raised in a in a area i was raised by a real angry father and and um 

485.29 490.37 B: you know it's real hard to hear his counsel it's hard to hear his wisdom because ah 

489.50 491.05 A: right yeah 

490.70 495.95 B: you know his stuck out so much and you know just the character issues 

493.34 494.23 A: yeah 

496.07 496.98 A: yeah 

496.27 497.89 B: and so um 

498.04 505.34 B: but so so my approaching that was that you know we make a lot of mistakes but to try to you know try to maintain 

505.42 517.70 B: the kind of relationship with my children where i can i talk to them my youngest son is eighteen now and he's high school senior and i taught at his school for five years i'm not teaching now but i have i was 

516.18 517.14 A: mhm 

517.35 518.46 A: mhm 

517.82 519.31 B: and um 

519.95 527.30 B: you know and i've got a married daughter and i've got two older step kids and and they have had you know i- i've been 

527.73 532.96 B: you know pretty successful and ah and and and i feel good about that that ah 

533.23 535.99 B: if i made as many mistakes as my dad did 

536.10 539.81 B: or my you know just in general relationships are difficult but 

539.68 543.54 B: ah just to try to maintain a level where 

543.39 547.96 B: you know if i blow it where i just can humble myself to my kids and not 

546.66 548.43 A: yeah yeah 

547.90 558.94 B: and not have to be right all the time and so that there's a relationship there other than you know i'm bigger than you are and so my ways the only way that makes any sense 

558.24 560.03 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

559.44 562.86 B: and and that was that was successful i think 

561.82 566.76 A: yeah well i i know that ah with with ah my kids 

566.70 570.49 A: that ah my husband was very lenient with them 

570.37 579.20 A: you know if he told them no well in a little while he'd go ahead and tell them yes but if i told them no i meant no my kids knew that i meant no 

570.51 572.35 B: mhm 

579.03 585.41 A: but i could tell my kids that i loved them you know where my husband couldn't tell them that he loved them 

584.79 586.03 B: right 

585.61 589.79 A: and ah my my parents they never told me really 

589.80 592.67 A: how much they loved me you know they might 

592.82 596.96 A: i don't think i ever heard my dad say that he loved me 

597.10 599.89 A: but i my mom i think told me one or two times
