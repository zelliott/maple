114.68 129.60 B: and i and they they would give us these um this was kind of a big employee perk believe me they didn't pay us very much but it was our big perk was these um like the employee salvage sales and ah there was a 

129.64 138.29 B: cur- not a curio a like an entertain- an entertainment armoire that i could have bought for like 

138.25 150.10 B: you know only a few hundred dollars that turned out to be like a three thousand dollar armoire we never know what's going to be there and you know just that sixty seconds that i hesitated and then i bought something 

144.11 145.63 A: yeah 

150.13 163.89 B: a a garden set that i had buyer's regret on [laughter] then i thought man i made the wrong decision and you have to think so quickly and oh dear and that's probably a pretty silly thing but i 

152.64 153.59 A: (( [laughter] )) 

153.96 156.29 A: [laughter] 

157.15 158.62 A: [laughter]

163.88 167.40 B: (( [laughter] )) 

167.84 174.75 B: but every you know since then i've only be in a house i'm i'm thirty two and i've only been in my own house for 

174.78 189.22 B: a few years now so it's kind of like a i've needed furniture and it's like i've looked back on that thinking you know i could have used that for my computer i could have used that for my television and when you have to go out and buy r- pay retail for things 

188.61 189.97 A: oh yes 

189.15 201.71 B: oh it's so expensive and this was such a beautiful really fancy like an italian piece and i just oh and it just makes me sick to think about it but you know it's [laughter] 

196.40 197.47 A: uh-huh 

201.45 203.41 A: you just have to let it go don't you 

203.21 208.72 B: yeah you just have to let it go and and pay retail later and as 

208.93 210.10 A: yeah 

209.37 218.47 B: best you can i'm sure the person who got it you know sixty seconds later was thrilled to pieces [laughter] 

216.55 228.07 A: that's right [laughter] i did actually think of something that i regret uh when i got married of course i'm forty three and ah when i got married like twenty years twenty three years go now 

222.93 223.94 B: mhm 

227.79 228.65 B: uh-huh 

228.04 231.82 A: ah i had left some things at my mother and father's house 

231.53 232.42 B: (( oh oh )) 

231.86 241.07 A: and when i went back to get them my mother and went in one of her cleaning spells and threw them out and i had a mickey mantle baseball card 

241.08 254.18 A: and ah it turned out that that baseball card was worth a good bit of money and she had thrown all of my stuff out and that made me sick [laughter] so if i could go back i'd probably go back and swipe all my stuff before she threw it all out 

254.30 257.95 A: [laughter] 

254.63 261.62 B: [laughter] yes sometimes those things sneak up on you and you just never know 

261.01 261.85 A: [laughter] 

261.98 265.77 B: oh that is really sad oh dear 

265.13 279.74 A: i know we were sitt- what it was it wasn't too long after we got married we were sitting watching television and all of a sudden they were talking about this mickey mantle baseball card and i said i have that baseball card and ah so the next morning i take off and go to my mother's house 

269.93 270.92 B: mhm 

275.09 275.94 B: oh 

279.29 280.28 B: uh-huh 

279.70 286.58 A: to get my things and oh i went through that stuff not too long ago and i threw all that stuff out i didn't think you wanted it anymore 

286.29 287.34 B: (( [laughter] )) 

286.65 292.96 A: and so i- i'm in a really sick mood [laughter] 

289.15 300.34 B: [laughter] oh that's so sad [laughter] my parents go through that my dad doesn't clean he just decides like once 

300.11 308.96 B: every few years he just picks up a bunch of stuff and throws it [laughter] and that drives my mom crazy 

303.82 305.59 A: (( mhm )) 

308.21 311.33 A: it doesn't matter what it is out it goes [laughter] 

310.15 317.72 B: [laughter] yeah he just just a bunch of stuff just grabs a bunch of stuff and throws it [laughter] 

315.95 316.81 A: [laughter] 

316.90 320.21 A: just gets tired of seeing it eh and out it goes 

318.92 320.01 B: yeah 

320.22 321.52 A: (( mm mm mm )) 

320.27 332.30 B: yeah yeah it's sad but true i think my other um if i could go back in time the other thing i would change and i know this probably shouldn't mean anything especially now that i'm thirty two but 

332.46 339.25 B: back in back in school that that i could have been a cheerleader and i chose not to 

339.22 340.27 A: (( oh )) 

339.79 343.25 B: because it it conflicted with 

343.32 347.59 B: with choir which seems so silly now 

346.96 348.13 A: [laughter] 

348.05 360.68 B: and it was just my first year and it conflicted with that and i and i love to sing and i chose choir and then after that it's kind of like you really couldn't get back into it 

360.61 367.07 B: so and then i and i kind of regret it because i would have i probably would have been with a different crowd and 

366.71 367.89 A: yeah 

367.16 375.06 B: and i'm you know might have had a little bit more fun in high school because high school's you know pretty hard on most of us 

375.20 381.09 B: and and sometimes wonder if i would have chose the other how different my life might have been 

380.71 387.40 A: yeah that's something you don't ever know isn't it the decis- the little decisions you make it could affect everything 

383.50 384.40 B: it it 

386.91 399.91 B: yeah and i guess i thought that i i could do it later if i wanted to but it was one of those things that once you got into it the first year they they cheerleaders were pretty much set for the rest of school and 

399.24 400.69 A: that's right 

400.21 406.76 B: and [laughter] it would have been i probably would have really enjoyed it but you know when you 

400.82 401.73 A: [laughter] 

406.79 411.23 B: have classes that go up against each other and you have to make a choice you 

411.28 416.94 B: just try to do the best you can at that type time and and hope you don't regret it later 

416.50 420.11 A: yeah but i guess we all have regrets about something 

419.98 421.17 B: yeah 

420.55 424.52 A: even if they are insignificant things [laughter] 

423.32 427.79 B: [laughter] yeah we could probably go on and on all day [laughter] 

426.56 429.97 A: that's right now do you li- where do you live 

429.77 431.63 B: (( i'm in irving texas )) 

431.36 434.55 A: oh well i'm in mississippi 

432.06 433.34 B: where are you 

434.33 436.03 B: oh mississippi i've 

435.24 437.93 A: so we're not too far off [laughter] 

436.91 448.62 B: no no i've i've driven through mississippi one time and and the only thing i really remember is how how tall the i think it was wisteria had gone 

447.66 450.32 A: well probably so ours [noise] 

448.97 456.12 B: oh and it just trees and up phone poles and oh it was just gorgeous 

456.35 461.69 A: [noise] in our town we we have tons of magnolias that's what and older 

461.83 463.82 A: type homes where i live 

463.41 465.33 B: oh how pretty 

463.95 464.80 A: so 

464.95 465.84 A: [laughter] 

465.50 466.81 B: yeah 

465.87 471.33 A: of course it's got we're kind of our town is kind of economically depressed but 

470.59 473.27 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

472.16 476.54 A: i don't know if it there's probably tons of places like that [laughter] [noise] 

476.67 477.65 A: (( yeah )) 

476.99 484.65 B: well yeah that that's probably true um irving is well home of the dallas cowboys we're in dallas county and 

484.74 488.66 B: and it's ah you know they're talking about 

488.89 501.12 B: pe- other places and in our surrounding area have been trying to move the cowboys away and the stadium and all that and and there are some people that are upset about it but when it comes right down to it 

501.66 508.55 B: irving our city we don't really see any of that money i don't know where it goes you know 

507.78 514.03 A: and doesn't that make you wonder when you have things like that why the it's not pumped back into your local economy 

513.47 525.58 B: yeah i mean we have stores that are going out of business here we have um you know a k. mart a huge k. mart just like a lot of places do that it's going under we had um 

525.35 538.23 B: just several major stores that are going under and it just seems like that money is not coming to our city and it's really upsetting [laughter] so i guess i don't care if they leave or not i i don't think they will but 

531.54 535.46 A: [noise] yeah yeah 

538.44 539.94 B: but it's ah 

540.06 543.75 B: it's tough and the area that i live in um 

543.79 553.16 B: dallas we're i think number two in the nation for road rage they say that three thousand people every week move to dallas 

552.65 554.12 A: (( [cough] wow )) 

553.32 563.93 B: now we don't have room for them so when my parents first moved out here with probably like fifteen minutes fifteen years ago and ah it was ah 

555.05 556.73 A: [laughter] 

564.78 572.49 B: it was just outside dallas a little bit further about ten minutes away from where i was everything was so countryish 

572.30 573.94 A: [laughter] 

572.51 584.82 B: and ah boy that is not the case anymore it's just we've got so many people here that there are plenty of times that it makes you think that you want to move further out into the country because [laughter] 

584.17 592.68 A: yeah well now i i guess we're kind of rural and now that might be something i i've lived here all of my life i've never lived anywhere else 

588.04 589.04 B: yeah 

592.13 593.24 B: yeah 

592.58 599.90 A: and maybe that would be something that you know if i could go back in time i might go back and ah make a decision to leave here 

599.52 599.90 B: (( yeah ))
