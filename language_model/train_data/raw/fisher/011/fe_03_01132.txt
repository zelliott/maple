26.65 28.67 B: so i guess the topic was if you could 

29.04 29.58 A: go back 

29.04 30.10 B: travel back in time 

31.03 33.33 B: what would you like to change that you have done 

33.49 34.20 B: and why 

34.84 37.39 A: i don't think i would want to go back in time 

38.19 38.81 B: uh 

41.05 43.02 B: but that's the topic so i think 

43.58 45.42 B: uh i would like to go back in time and 

46.02 48.60 B: not sure if i would like to change something but 

48.78 50.19 B: i would definitely like to see 

51.01 54.04 B: my family and my elders and my parents and how they were 

54.33 54.77 A: right 

55.14 55.56 B: and 

56.76 59.05 B: just how their life was and things like that 

59.07 62.17 A: i mean like it would be good to go back in time if you could like 

62.68 65.75 A: change like major mistakes that you've made in your life 

65.85 66.26 A: but 

66.93 69.25 B: i also can't recall what major mistake i have made 

69.54 70.05 A: what's that 

70.24 74.48 B: i also but i can't recall what major mistake i have made that i would like to change 

74.72 76.09 A: that you can't recall any 

76.29 76.81 B: uh 

77.78 79.70 B: i'm sure i've had my share of mistakes but 

80.16 81.22 A: none that you would change 

81.24 81.74 B: yet no 

82.58 85.02 B: we have to really think of something that we can change 

85.31 85.75 A: right 

85.81 87.28 B: so let me think well 

87.54 88.28 B: you also think 

90.35 91.18 B: change 

94.09 95.44 B: well i was born in india 

95.61 96.01 B: and 

96.78 97.61 B: i came to 

98.17 98.87 B: u._s. 

99.86 100.97 B: like about ten years ago 

104.25 106.62 B: but i guess the topic is something you could change 

106.91 107.33 A: right 

106.94 108.05 B: that you have done not 

108.61 110.49 A: would you change coming to the united states 

111.50 117.76 B: uh no i would not change coming to the united states maybe maybe i would come a little earlier so that's a change 

115.87 116.97 A: yeah oh really 

117.37 117.77 A: yeah 

117.92 121.60 B: i came here for my like uh higher education for college education and all 

122.33 125.49 B: uh maybe i would come and do some schooling here one thing i really missed 

125.68 126.74 B: i would tell you like okay 

126.89 128.03 B: that i can say 

128.17 128.97 B: uh 

129.29 130.75 B: i learned about the proms and 

131.25 133.03 B: what they do in schools here and things like that 

133.27 133.96 B: what fun it is 

134.19 134.57 A: right 

134.79 135.57 B: so maybe i would 

136.30 139.65 B: i would like to come a little earlier if i can could go back in time 

140.35 141.68 B: and start off like 

141.79 143.43 B: taking g. mat g._r._e. -s which i took 

144.46 146.65 B: i should have taken sat earlier and come 

147.51 149.16 B: not sat whatever i should have just 

149.34 150.20 B: come and did some 

150.54 150.82 B: schooling 

151.33 151.76 A: right 

154.59 155.54 B: five years earlier 

160.83 162.01 B: what about you what will you do 

160.88 161.33 A: right 

162.51 162.99 A: um 

163.56 164.33 A: i don't know but i 

164.44 165.45 A: i guess maybe i would 

165.97 167.87 A: go to college -cause i didn't go 

168.06 168.47 B: okay 

168.85 169.27 A: um 

169.48 171.89 A: i went to like trade school instead 

171.96 172.34 B: uh-huh 

172.77 177.51 A: and um which was okay but now like you know i i really don't ha- i don't have a job 

177.93 178.41 B: okay 

178.50 179.19 A: and uh 

180.63 184.26 B: (( )) yeah that's that's a thing like maybe if you could go back in time and 

185.43 187.70 B: that time maybe college didn't was not 

186.83 187.30 A: right 

188.04 189.00 B: so great or 

188.67 190.37 A: right -cause now like uh 

190.51 195.06 A: it's like impossible for me to do that because i have a kid and i'm a single mom and 

196.47 197.15 A: kind of hard 

201.78 203.57 B: yeah and and at that time perhaps we 

203.73 205.64 B: when we are young we don't realize the important 

206.85 209.03 B: or maybe the circumstances of that like that we can't (( change )) 

206.92 207.26 A: yeah 

209.26 209.67 A: right 

209.77 211.38 B: i'm sure if you could change that 

212.44 214.86 B: and i'm i'm sure if you had gone to college things would've been 

216.03 219.33 B: not not saying that things are not better but things may have been even better 

219.59 220.07 A: right 

222.19 223.66 B: i guess we both are uh 

224.20 225.26 B: going towards education 

225.40 227.13 A: yeah right i guess 

226.67 227.10 B: and how 

227.47 229.65 B: how many minutes do we have passed 

227.52 227.94 A: i'm sorry 

228.75 229.51 A: hold on 

230.33 230.68 A: um 

230.96 233.84 A: uh only four minutes and what we have like four more minutes 

233.31 235.03 B: okay so what else would you like to change 

235.10 235.62 A: um 

235.87 236.67 A: i h- i would 

237.19 240.65 A: definitely change some of uh the people that i've 

240.99 243.82 A: met and become friends with 

243.78 244.18 B: uh-huh 

244.30 244.86 A: um 

246.73 248.71 A: backstabbers that 

250.21 251.10 A: have revealed 

250.71 251.49 B: you would like to 

251.68 252.77 B: have like better 

253.55 255.32 B: better relationships better friendships 

253.62 254.01 A: right 

255.38 256.06 A: right 

256.17 264.33 A: uh or you know like one in particular uh girlfriend of mine that you know i was friends with forever just recently you know 

265.24 265.50 A: went 

265.67 267.49 A: crazy and started 

267.62 269.73 A: um talking to my son's father about 

269.94 277.05 A: tom and what a bad mother i am and stuff like stuff that wasn't even true and like telling him stuff that like i 

277.23 280.22 A: would only tell her you know like intimate stuff that 

278.78 279.09 B: oh 

279.91 280.91 B: that's really backstabbing 

280.94 285.34 A: right and so you know i would probably go back and not 

285.46 286.43 A: tell anybody 

287.77 288.15 A: such 

288.45 290.21 A: close things about myself 

293.53 294.67 B: huh okay 

295.03 296.03 B: let me think what i would 

296.42 298.50 B: i would do differently i think like 

298.99 299.81 B: just like here 

299.95 301.74 B: kids go out of the house 

302.53 305.32 B: in india also like once they graduate high school and all that so 

305.47 309.53 B: i have been like practically away from my family for the last what twenty years or even more 

311.60 311.94 B: uh 

312.33 314.70 B: they have done a lot of things for me but i have not done anything 

315.74 317.39 B: so maybe if i could go back in time 

320.15 321.71 B: i mean basically there's stuff always 

321.92 323.28 B: happens like pay it forward 

323.40 324.61 B: parents do something for you 

324.78 325.23 A: right 

325.22 326.42 B: you do it for your kids 

326.71 327.14 A: right 

326.86 328.73 B: but it doesn't go like backwards 

328.71 329.14 A: right 

331.09 332.89 B: i'm like well off now and everything but 

333.21 334.18 B: like have not 

334.59 336.80 B: given them anything or done anything for them so maybe 

337.45 338.68 B: if i could go back in time 

339.67 342.39 B: uh i guess i would try to be a better son or 

343.22 344.16 B: do something for my 

345.31 347.38 B: uh well (( )) who 

347.54 348.21 B: came with me 

348.35 350.99 B: uh who who were associated with me before i was born 

351.67 354.85 B: rather than only for those who i associated with and i chose 

356.28 358.04 B: so that's what i can think of that 

358.19 359.58 B: hey if i could go back in time 

359.88 360.34 A: right 

360.28 360.95 B: maybe i will 

361.15 362.60 B: try to do things a little better i will 

362.76 364.39 B: realize the importance of how 

365.55 367.51 B: important those people were to me and i should 

369.01 369.46 A: yeah 

371.04 372.98 A: yeah that that that's a good point and 

373.51 375.11 A: i if i go back in time i'd 

375.29 377.61 A: try to have a better relationship with my father 

381.83 383.60 B: -cause as we know you can't go back in time and 

383.78 384.67 B: time never comes back 

384.95 385.30 A: yeah 

386.92 388.03 B: you don't get second chances 

395.26 397.11 A: but i guess some of the things that we talked about 

397.32 397.66 B: uh-huh 

399.66 400.61 A: you know 

401.09 401.76 B: yeah i mean 

401.90 402.51 B: definitely 

403.51 404.07 B: maybe 

404.54 406.05 B: and that's for the purpose of this call 

406.97 407.38 B: (( listening )) 

412.97 414.72 B: hey are you not enjoying talking to me 

414.53 417.76 A: oh yeah yeah i was right in the middle of the president 

414.85 416.05 B: i'm just kidding ha ha 

418.58 419.27 B: ha ha 

419.79 423.41 B: oh my goodness i just forgot about it eight o'clock it was supposed to come on isn't it 

427.68 428.13 A: yeah 

431.05 431.97 A: but other than that i mean 

432.23 433.91 B: would you like to change what's happening 

435.10 435.66 A: what's hap- 

435.35 436.50 B: oh let's not go there maybe 

436.92 438.08 A: uh what's happening with what 

438.16 440.63 B: with the iraq situation and all that yeah 

438.93 439.66 A: with the war 

441.18 441.77 A: um 

442.43 445.45 A: no i you know what i i kind of agree with 

445.59 446.33 A: the president 

447.22 447.87 A: because 

449.13 450.75 A: it obviously he 

450.87 454.18 A: you know he knows more stuff than we do about what's going on over there 
453.98 456.03 B: i i really like re- that agree to that 

455.98 456.49 A: and 

456.19 456.64 B: but hey 

456.73 458.21 B: aren't there other countries 

458.95 461.89 B: which are even worse than iraq uh for this kind of 

462.08 463.43 B: thing like north korea if you are 

463.62 467.14 A: oh yeah i definitely think north korea is a bigger threat but 

464.22 464.53 B: (( )) 

466.56 469.83 B: so we are (( )) can and not where yeah we can't 

469.93 470.88 A: right 

471.27 471.72 B: can (( )) 

472.64 474.12 B: secondly like even though 

474.44 476.26 B: see just like how it happens in this country 

476.68 479.36 B: somebody may say like normal domestic disputes and 

479.53 484.40 B: judicial systems somebody may be an offender or maybe (( )) but all the effects and everything is against him 

485.47 487.70 B: everybody has to abide by the decisions of the court 

487.86 488.30 A: right 

488.45 490.47 B: like that we had a world court the u._n. 

491.46 493.05 B: so maybe we don't agree (( )) but 

493.42 496.47 B: hey all of us have consensus are in front of them all countries are members 

496.64 497.07 A: right 

497.12 498.36 B: whole world is against it 

499.30 499.72 B: and 

499.97 501.29 B: because we can't do it 

501.42 502.54 B: we have decided okay 

503.09 504.37 B: if you don't allow us 

505.56 507.30 B: we will ignore you we will just do it anyway 

508.13 509.00 B: so i think 

509.71 512.14 B: that's that's really like saying that we are with the u._n. 

512.86 513.51 B: as long as uh 

514.26 516.23 B: all your decisions are what we want 

516.34 516.83 A: right 

516.92 519.40 B: if you say something against you we don't care get out of here 

519.64 521.14 B: we will do what we want anyway 

521.53 524.65 A: but another point with that though is 

525.52 526.06 A: you know 

526.35 528.78 A: a lot of the other countries just don't want 

529.05 537.89 A: they don't want involved in it which is pretty ridiculous especially france since we were by their their sides for all their wars
