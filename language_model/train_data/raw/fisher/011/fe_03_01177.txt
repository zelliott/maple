16.15 18.94 A: there is um there used to be a book called the book of questions 

19.38 19.80 B: uh-huh 

19.44 25.26 A: that um was i guess was intended to be a conversation starter at parties or something and there was a similar question 

25.48 28.01 A: and in fact there are a couple of questions that were similar one was 

28.53 35.19 A: you know similar or something to do with money i suppose but you um you could either never again leave the state you live in 

35.44 36.79 A: um or you could 

36.95 42.13 A: you had to leave the country and never come back yeah i know so uh never 

39.05 40.13 B: oh my goodness 

40.94 41.50 B: oh 

42.52 45.68 A: a million dollars isn't really that much money in the whole scheme of things 

45.82 46.27 B: no 

46.27 47.06 A: i mean to me 

46.41 46.90 B: no 

47.18 53.78 A: you ten dollars is at the moment but um um to never again i would have to say um 

53.91 58.05 A: god i'd like to say i wouldn't do it but i might 

57.98 58.62 B: yeah um 

58.91 60.03 B: i i li- i y- i 

60.28 70.07 B: (( )) i right now the way the economy is going it is real tempting but um you know money comes and goes and friendships are 

69.75 70.55 A: this is true 

70.48 71.29 B: you know what lasts 

71.41 72.12 B: for 

72.31 75.95 B: hopefully forever or at least for many years and um 

76.32 78.15 B: if you really look at it it is um 

78.38 79.51 B: you know and you look at 

79.64 83.58 B: your household income although a million dollars is a lot of money 

88.03 89.38 A: right yeah 

89.66 96.25 B: we are anything like most people you know you spend it as you get it but um yeah i don't i don't think that would be 

96.75 100.00 B: i don't think that would be worth it but yeah that would be horribly 

97.90 98.70 A: no 

100.16 102.33 B: horribly tempting 

106.53 108.53 A: a million dollars you know if they said 

108.71 111.28 A: nine hundred thousand dollars you would probably say no 

111.40 111.98 B: right 

111.69 115.15 A: but i- but there is something that just sounds so 

115.47 118.05 A: i don't know romantic and 

116.67 117.26 B: but (( )) 

117.59 121.32 B: it does it's it's a fantasy it is an absolute fantasy 

119.71 129.85 A: it really is but like you said um really in the whole scheme of things uh considering what you will earn in a course of an entire lifetime and the fact that a true friendship is really a precious thing 

130.05 130.57 B: mhm 

130.44 133.59 A: um and and they are few and far between ultimately 

133.80 134.22 B: yeah 

134.08 134.41 A: so 

134.67 137.92 A: no i wouldn't do it 

137.51 138.93 B: well and then also 

138.04 143.31 A: what kind of a cruel anonymous benefactor would make that sort of stipulation 

141.50 142.77 B: oh i know 

143.44 144.15 B: no i could i could 

144.28 148.64 B: maybe leave the country i could probably do that one 

149.92 158.16 A: events of the last twenty four hours but yeah that uh and and never again leave the state though that is a tough one 

157.85 160.08 B: oh i i have to leave my family 

162.10 164.33 B: my god 

163.04 164.84 A: which what state is that 

164.74 170.80 B: texas it's uh it's just flat there is nothing here 

165.51 166.21 A: uh 

167.83 169.97 A: yeah yeah 

170.23 173.85 A: well i'm i'm not uh this is north carolina so it is not flat but um 

174.72 176.41 A: you know there uh there are 

176.74 182.45 A: there are certain limitations let's just say wow 

178.67 180.81 B: absolutely 

181.61 182.19 B: yeah 

182.60 186.57 A: that is that is quite an interesting question they gave us isn't it how did you hear about this 

185.22 186.17 B: it is 

187.10 190.33 B: oh oh i came on a a money and shopping dot com 

190.22 190.91 A: oh same 

191.56 193.42 A: yeah 

197.91 203.88 B: sometimes the shopping assignments are kind of hard to do to find a sitter or i'll take her with me and 

201.70 207.41 A: oh i know i know you know i kind of gave up on it -cause i found that i was applying for so many and not getting them 

207.66 208.37 B: oh me too 

207.90 213.34 A: and i eventually started directly e. mailing the schedulers and saying what does one have to do 

212.86 213.48 B: yeah 

213.55 218.21 A: you know seriously and they you know oh you know it's just kind of random and well 

218.33 220.78 A: you know sooner or later you have to pick me 

220.74 221.55 B: well uh you know 

220.91 227.27 A: i had a big rush of them back in like september and october i was doing a few a week and i have a small child too 

225.92 226.23 B: hm 

227.48 228.25 B: oh 

227.48 228.40 A: so it was nice 

228.86 229.30 B: yeah 

228.90 231.42 A: you know -cause i'm not working outside of the house 

231.53 232.07 B: right 

231.96 233.33 A: i don't know if you are but 

233.25 233.73 B: no 

233.64 234.16 A: um 

234.30 235.65 A: you know it was good it wasn't 

235.87 238.46 A: uh but it never seemed to be enough money to make it 

238.94 239.98 A: that worthwhile 

240.22 240.68 B: right 

241.11 242.69 A: unless i'm going to the store anyway 

242.71 243.71 B: right 

243.86 247.70 B: right well the one that has been available i i live in houston 

248.16 250.19 B: and houston is about thirty five miles 

248.46 249.07 A: oh yeah 

250.33 251.55 B: um across 

251.85 253.54 A: oh god 

252.49 256.93 B: and uh you know so i get these ones that are like you know 

257.18 259.01 B: they take me an hour to get there 

259.57 260.71 A: to make eight dollars 

260.50 264.42 B: right and at the point it is just not worth it 

261.11 261.74 A: yeah 

263.26 264.07 A: no 

264.60 267.93 B: but there have there are some that have been closer to home and 

264.77 265.19 A: there is 

268.38 273.08 B: you know like this telephone thing that that's you can't leave that one 
271.13 272.39 A: no you can't beat that 

276.42 276.87 B: yeah 

279.00 280.33 A: lier in the world 

280.69 286.29 A: and so i always feel really bad that i'm uh even though often i i've only um 

283.59 284.12 B: yeah 

286.47 288.10 A: done like three or four of -em 

288.36 289.39 A: and and 

290.01 298.70 A: one of them did not do a very good job but the other three were just fabulous so i mean really i was ended up doing these people a favor -cause i wrote great reviews for them 

298.48 298.96 B: uh-huh 

298.98 299.76 A: but i thought 

300.13 310.73 A: i just hate lying you know it's different to just go in and observe or you know just answer questions but to have to flat out tell a lie about why i you know i was there looking at the apartment 

302.49 303.31 B: well 

310.91 314.02 A: it is not even that i had a philosophical problem i just couldn't do it 
314.14 314.68 B: yeah 

314.17 316.24 A: i'm just not good at it 

315.63 319.79 B: yeah it that that can be very tough i i did a a couple of them and 

320.35 320.94 B: um 

321.26 321.84 B: they were 

322.02 325.90 B: they were pretty far away from my home but you know for twenty five dollars i will 

326.02 331.42 B: i'll drive a little bit further you know and i did two the same day so that worked out well 

327.69 328.83 A: yeah yeah 

330.75 331.50 A: well that is nice 

331.63 334.58 B: yeah and uh i just um i i'm 

334.74 339.03 B: i thought i did pretty good and then before i even got home i got the follow up call 

339.43 339.96 A: oh 

339.63 345.52 B: and i was like okay they knew i was a shopper because they didn't even give me you know forty minutes to get home 

346.87 347.72 A: so the women who 

347.85 348.24 A: was just 

355.09 355.62 B: um 

355.36 366.44 A: and she was very nice i mean and she didn't do anything that would have prevented me from renting an apartment there if i had really been interested but she certainly didn't try to entice me in any way at all 

366.54 367.53 A: and um 

368.29 374.78 A: i but i didn't i didn't think she was on to me or anything so i went you know i went home i did the review and probably and that was on a saturday 

382.40 384.78 B: oh no 

384.31 389.76 A: and just went on about the clubhouse and the pool and the business center and i thought 

390.30 393.45 A: okay somehow you figured this out 

393.06 394.64 B: (( )) 

393.89 397.25 A: so i thought i thought what did i do you know (( this is uh )) 

397.36 397.82 A: weird 

398.00 400.15 B: oh one girl had i mean i walked in and 

400.40 405.02 B: i talked to her on the phone and she had i mean every brochure that company made 

405.16 413.55 B: ready for me i mean i get into the car and i'm like okay where do i put this book um -cause it is one of those apartment complexes that had about 

413.75 415.60 B: you know fifteen floor plans
