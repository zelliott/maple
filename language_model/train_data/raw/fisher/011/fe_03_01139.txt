1.80 2.28 A: hi there 

2.66 3.08 B: hi 

3.21 4.59 A: hi my name's mike i'm 

4.94 6.75 A: here from uh madison wisconsin 

7.28 10.02 B: uh my name is forrest i'm from uh winona minnesota 

10.01 11.59 A: oh not too far away then 

11.72 12.81 B: yeah pretty close to the border 

12.75 16.16 A: yeah it's pretty close uh i guess we're the only two on the call 

15.81 16.43 B: i guess so 

16.80 20.53 A: so i uh if i have this uh understanding right we're supposed to discuss uh 

21.08 24.15 A: we go back in time something we'd want to change and why 

24.28 24.71 B: hm mhm 

24.71 25.77 A: okay um 

26.42 28.64 A: guess uh 

28.76 30.67 A: i mean do you know what your answer is 

30.51 31.02 B: uh 

31.52 32.51 B: i don't really know 

32.51 35.01 A: there's a few things i could i guess i could 

35.27 37.38 A: i guess i could think of 

38.46 41.21 A: let me think what would i do okay probably the most 

41.47 42.08 A: eh 

42.72 43.04 B: hm mhm 

42.79 45.86 A: probably what i would go back and change is i 

46.28 53.91 A: i'm divorced so i guess i would have never i en- i married my best friend i guess i would have never asked her to marry me i guess i would have 

54.18 54.98 A: um 

56.00 56.60 A: rather than 

56.74 58.60 A: getting married i would have just 

59.70 62.62 A: tried to end the relationship without ever asking her to marry me um 

62.95 64.98 A: and of ended it without uh 

65.87 71.46 A: progressing beyond that point and remaining friends be- be- because of that we got married and eventually 

71.59 75.27 A: got divorced amicably but as a result 

73.57 73.95 B: hm 

75.81 86.16 A: we're no longer in contact at all so not only did i lose my wife i lost my best friend so i guess looking back i guess i would rather at this point have not gone through 

86.70 88.61 A: what i went through um 

89.20 91.47 A: with her and still and still had the friendship 

91.83 93.62 A: if that if that makes any kind of sense 

93.43 94.26 B: how long ago was that 

94.37 95.38 A: uh that was 

96.14 96.54 A: i 

98.01 105.01 A: uh let's see got married in ninety seven and divorced in ninety eight we'd been together since ninety three so it's been quite a long 

105.22 107.63 A: relationship before we got married i basically 

108.23 109.66 A: gave in to uh 

110.42 112.71 A: she basically kind of set a deadline um 

112.54 113.02 B: oh 

113.51 114.12 B: that's rough 

122.20 123.03 B: that's pretty funny 

123.32 125.85 A: talking on saint patrick's day right now so um 

126.11 129.45 A: that was going to be the the deadline and i asked her to 

129.80 136.23 A: to marry me uh two days before christmas in i'm trying to think if i've got the timetable right i believe in ninety six 

136.00 136.30 B: hm 

136.39 137.42 A: so um 

137.86 139.33 A: that would probably the 

139.49 144.20 A: the one the major thing because it would have saved i guess uh 

144.36 146.42 A: i wouldn't say wasted years but i guess when you 

146.54 149.15 A: when you spend time invested in a relationship the one thing i can 

156.88 157.22 B: hm 

157.16 166.30 A: and live out and do things that she wouldn't have done if she were still in the relationship with me and she has since remarried and just had her first child last year and went back and got her teaching degree so at least that um 

166.88 169.70 A: i'm very happy about so um she was 

170.02 174.53 A: able to do all of that but if that would probably be the most major thing i guess that uh 

174.65 175.98 A: i can think of in my life if i could 

176.35 179.92 A: get in a time travel machine i guess if that's the hypothetical situation 

178.70 179.08 B: yeah 

180.13 181.86 A: and change so anything 

182.46 183.48 A: that big for you 

183.49 185.22 B: uh well like what 

185.34 186.21 B: i guess like 

186.81 187.64 B: a few years ago 

187.78 188.98 B: i don't remember how long but 

189.31 191.19 B: uh my mom and dad got divorced 

191.28 191.63 A: hm mhm 

191.48 193.38 B: and i guess it was sort of like a messy thing and stuff 

194.11 197.65 B: and then my dad he works in like environmental studies type sort of thing 

197.64 197.98 A: hm mhm 

198.21 200.84 B: and so he moves to asia he moved to the philippines 

200.65 201.34 A: oh wow 

201.57 203.61 B: to work at this place their asian development bank 

203.61 203.94 A: hm mhm 

204.83 205.91 B: and then um 

206.25 209.03 B: one summer like over the summer school break whatever 

209.87 213.70 B: he uh like invited me and my sister to go there to visit him or whatever 

213.52 213.92 A: uh huh 

214.72 215.83 B: but then uh 

216.01 219.07 B: i guess you know the agreement was we'd go there and then we come back at the end of the summer whatever 

219.37 220.63 B: start school that sort of thing 

220.58 220.97 A: right 

221.49 222.14 B: but then 

221.51 222.71 A: and how old were you at the time 

223.15 224.76 B: i was uh like 

226.46 227.04 B: thirteen 

227.08 228.06 A: and how old was your sister 

228.73 230.19 B: she was i don't know 

230.36 231.43 B: uh seven maybe 

231.43 231.79 A: uh huh 

232.82 236.18 B: and so i mean my mom was sort of like suspicious of the situation 

236.10 236.49 A: okay 

237.06 240.60 B: and stuff but we ended up going anyways it was the promise we would return or whatever 

240.61 240.96 A: right 

241.64 244.00 B: but then what ended up happening is he basically sort of 

244.19 245.82 B: uh went against his word 

246.22 248.67 B: and decided that we should stay there sort of indefinitely 

249.85 254.35 B: which was against the agreement that there was there was actually like a legal agreement with the courts or whatever that 

254.81 257.44 B: he would only have custody of us for the limited amount of time 

257.24 257.58 A: right 

258.54 261.54 B: and so basically it got into a situation where eventually 

261.75 265.28 B: he let me come back like cause i was sort of protesting this generally 

265.26 265.62 A: hm mhm 

265.96 268.57 B: but it after li- a few months after i was supposed to come back even 

268.68 269.06 A: okay 

269.46 274.93 B: but then my sister cause she was so young and she didn't really know any better she wasn't you know really trying to get back or whatever 

272.53 272.90 A: right 

274.94 275.24 A: hm mhm 

275.62 278.62 B: she was just sort of content with the situation because she didn't really understand it 

278.69 279.01 A: right 

279.45 284.05 B: and so basically it ended up being this whole thing where she stayed there like way longer than she should have 

284.87 285.87 B: and uh 

287.09 287.84 B: basically 

287.95 290.03 B: my mom had to come and like bring her back 

290.89 294.11 B: and then my dad got like arrested and extradited sort of 

294.20 294.88 A: oh really 

295.13 295.71 B: yeah 

296.44 297.55 B: and then uh 

298.09 301.01 B: yeah that's basically what happened and i guess i would you know obviously 

301.83 306.19 B: reconsider going and basically tell my mom that i thought it was a bad idea and all that sort of thing 

306.22 308.93 A: and try to prevent your sister from going as well i assume right yeah 

308.08 308.86 B: right yeah 

309.75 312.16 B: i mean he didn't like go to prison or anything i think 

309.86 310.22 A: wow 

311.67 312.02 A: hm mhm 

313.05 316.40 B: well i guess he sort of tried to claim he had diplomatic immunity 

316.47 316.80 A: hm mhm 

317.02 319.11 B: cause he was working for this organization but 

319.21 320.20 B: it didn't really happen 

320.33 320.70 A: okay 

320.83 323.27 B: and i don't really know the whole story what happened legally 

323.92 324.76 B: but i guess 

325.12 326.44 B: something happened where he was 

327.58 329.25 B: he went before a judge or something 

329.59 330.29 B: in the u._s. 

330.68 332.80 B: but then uh i don't know what his punishment was 

333.65 335.53 B: but eventually he went back to the philippines 

336.23 338.24 B: and but i mean we haven't gone there or anything 

338.59 339.20 B: since then 

339.95 341.60 A: oh where is he located now 

341.79 342.91 B: he's still in the philippines 

342.60 343.79 A: oh he still is there 

343.84 344.30 B: yeah 

344.44 346.27 A: and how how old are you now can i ask 

346.48 347.48 B: i'm eighteen now 

347.31 349.12 A: oh okay so it's onl- this is 

349.38 351.31 A: not that long ago it was only five years ago 

350.61 351.63 B: no pretty recently 

351.62 352.41 A: oh okay 

352.81 357.03 A: wow so eh what is have yo- since he's gone back there have you seen him 

357.39 359.13 B: uh yeah well i guess 

359.31 360.58 A: i mean he comes back here i assume 

360.59 366.11 B: he does come occasionally like he came for christmas and we saw him for a few days but now everything has to be totally supervised 

366.10 366.62 A: okay 

366.71 370.79 B: like there always has to be a supervisor person from the court system there with us when he visits 

370.76 371.71 A: really wow 

372.00 375.07 B: and then he also he has a he calls us like once a month 

374.99 375.37 A: hm mhm 

375.23 376.60 B: every first friday or 

376.35 377.76 A: and does it have to be monitored or something 

377.55 380.51 B: something like that well no somebody actually has to come and like be on 

380.78 382.84 B: the phone while we're talking and listen to it 

382.01 384.38 A: that's what i mean somebody somebody's listening on the conversation 

383.88 384.34 B: yeah 

384.52 385.04 A: wow 

385.80 388.88 B: so the whole thing just it sort of like escalated everything a lot basically 

385.90 386.25 A: hol- 

388.91 396.05 A: yeah i can imagine what so eh- how did your feelings change as a result of all tha- i mean are you on good terms at a- with him still er 

395.38 395.92 B: well 

396.03 398.90 B: it's sort of like there's really been a big disconnect i think 

399.55 402.36 B: cause it's not like i hate him or anything but he's just like 

401.35 402.11 A: okay 

402.88 404.69 B: really not a part of my life anymore 

404.40 406.19 A: yeah he kind of abandoned you in other words 

406.48 412.40 B: yeah and i mean you know he always is calls me and says what are you doing or whatever and it just ends up being this weird situation 

412.91 415.38 B: where since he doesn't really know anything about what i'm doing 

415.23 415.65 A: right 

415.51 417.86 B: he just sort of ends up asking the same questions over and over 

417.89 418.29 A: hm mhm 

418.51 420.19 B: like he's sort of trying to you know 

421.08 423.47 B: learn stuff about me but he doesn't really know how to go about it 

424.29 426.87 A: yeah i mean i could imagine that must be really tough having 

427.33 433.34 A: to miss yeah your major formative years especially especially in high school my my father 

430.84 431.27 B: right 

436.60 436.91 B: hm 

440.91 445.61 A: lived long enough to see me through you know high school and uh 

447.76 448.11 B: right 

453.78 459.53 A: (( )) unfortunately see me go through a divorce but at least he was he was there for me so yeah i cannot i cannot relate to 

459.67 463.78 A: you know not having both parents there so yeah that's got to my 

464.05 468.65 A: i feel sorry for situation i is is this brought you closer you both closer to your mother then as a result 

468.81 471.68 B: uh i think somewhat i think we were always pretty close 

471.77 472.11 A: hm mhm 

472.21 474.94 B: but now that she's sort of like the one person that i depend on 

475.00 475.28 A: right 

475.70 476.94 B: she did get married again 

476.96 477.26 A: hm mhm 

477.14 478.83 B: so i have a stepfather but i don't know 

479.31 483.73 B: we're not really that close but yeah i guess it did bring (( )) closer to my mother now that i depend on her so much 

484.39 484.92 A: yeah i can 

485.22 486.21 A: can imagine that uh 

486.99 491.89 A: tough eh how does your sister feel about that i mean being obviously significantly younger than you 

491.73 492.79 B: right well i mean 

492.08 492.61 A: um 

492.95 494.14 B: i don't know i guess 

494.56 497.95 B: i sh- i don't think she ever really understood all the ramifications of it 

499.23 502.66 A: is she understanding better now that she's you know i guess she's a teenager now 

499.25 499.76 B: so 

502.76 503.42 A: or close to it 

502.86 503.43 B: uh 

503.79 504.53 B: somewhat 

505.04 505.92 B: but i mean 

506.78 510.53 B: i don't know it's kind of tough like i don't know if my mom would really want to go into the whole situation with her 

510.73 511.71 A: right the rehash 

511.17 512.83 B: and i think she understands sort of like the 

513.30 516.44 B: what he did wrong but still not really quite to the degree 

514.55 514.89 A: hm mhm 

517.12 520.05 B: so i think she probably has a better relationship with him than i do like 

520.61 523.62 B: you know when they talk on the phone she's always sort of excited to talk to him and stuff 

523.72 524.12 A: right 

524.16 526.04 B: whereas i'm not necessarily not 

526.25 527.67 A: right i can understand that 

528.47 534.31 A: because yeah you have a much better comprehension of what what went down and i guess at this point uh there's really no need to
