4.01 6.12 B: hi my name is christine 

6.49 11.58 A: okay and we're supposed to talk about if you could go back and change something 

11.70 18.77 B: yeah [laughter] there's a lot of things i'd like to change if i could go back in time but i think um 

20.07 21.83 B: probably 

22.29 24.62 B: the one thing would have been 

24.70 25.57 B: (( ah )) 

25.93 31.42 B: the choices i made in education i would have made different choices 

30.37 33.42 A: i would have done exactly the same thing [laughter] really 

31.66 37.95 B: [laughter] it seems like you know hindsight twenty twenty kind of thing 

36.34 37.95 A: right right 

38.04 39.19 B: um 

39.45 42.30 B: what kind what kind of ah schooling did you 

42.18 49.95 A: well i i i didn't apply to the really good schools that i um that were courting me 

42.52 43.63 B: actually do 

49.31 51.93 B: [laughter] would you have st- 

49.97 55.21 A: [laughter] 'cause i was convinced that i couldn't get um financial aid and i couldn't afford to go 

55.24 58.35 B: would you have still stayed in the same major 

58.18 60.31 A: oh yeah oh yeah yeah mhm 

58.37 64.29 B: do you think yeah see i think i would have picked a different major altogether i mean 

64.51 77.14 B: i was in school a long time ago [laughter] and [laughter] um i wa- i was a psychology major and i think i would have um leaned more towards science 

67.39 69.66 A: and so was i. [laughter] 

77.10 78.02 A: yeah 

77.41 79.96 B: like a true science kinda thing 

79.32 89.51 A: well again i got an electrical engineering degree and i didn't do real well because i stayed in state and i had to deal with my parents problems and that was kind of ah 

87.51 89.22 B: [laughter] 

89.59 90.43 A: (( you know )) 

90.39 93.05 B: this is like i was a 

90.44 91.55 A: (( you know )) 

93.36 94.66 B: (( i ah )) 

95.46 99.30 B: i was so stubborn and pig headed i guess back then 

99.45 101.68 B: um yeah i refused any 

100.49 102.84 A: [laughter] aren't all teenagers like that 

101.73 107.46 B: no i gu- i i i guess we are when you know that's normal that's like i um 

104.11 105.06 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

107.83 121.33 B: i refuse you know i i i mean i would starve before i would've asked my mom for a dime [laughter] you know kind of thing and so i worked full time and went to school so full time work was the priority 

116.68 117.71 A: mhm 

119.98 120.97 A: (( yeah i know )) 

121.27 122.19 A: yeah 

122.09 126.91 B: and i really wish you know that like i had done a different major but 

126.94 131.94 B: that i had applied myself gotten more out of it you know kind of thing 'cause i c- 

130.83 141.46 A: well i i think i would have gone to er applied for better schools and applied for scholarships because i was talked out of applying for a couple of scholarships 

137.71 138.65 B: mhm 

140.24 150.53 B: well i i didn't even know about like a._e._o._g. um until my junior year of college i mean they don't tell you those things 

142.38 143.57 A: yeah 

144.57 145.57 A: uh-huh 

147.35 148.60 A: [laughter] 

149.60 151.36 A: yeah yeah 

150.74 156.84 B: it's like if you don't know the right questions to ask then you don't get the answers you know 

153.65 154.62 A: yeah 

155.95 157.01 A: uh-huh 

156.86 158.77 B: and it's like um 

158.82 163.65 B: you know i i wish there had been a a required course in highschool or something 

163.85 168.85 A: or um actually it's the guidance counselor's high school guidance counselor's 

168.69 182.23 A: job to tell you but none of the guidance counselors i ever talked to did it was just you know the good kids in school talked about this sort of thing 'cause their parents wanted them to go to school and they researched it and i you know and 

175.96 176.64 B: mm 

179.43 180.78 B: right 

181.30 188.23 B: exactly and i my well my mom was the first person in her family ever to even finish highschool 

182.51 183.40 A: so 

187.69 188.92 A: (( ah )) 

188.24 192.99 B: so it was like that was a biggish big accomplishment you know kind of thing 

193.07 202.59 B: and so my mom and my stepdad it was kinda like just finish there whole goal was for my to finish highschool not wind up pregnant [laughter] you know 

202.23 203.24 A: yeah 

202.48 215.21 B: and when i finished highschool it was you either go to college go in the military or you get married those were your three choices [laughter] you know i mean it's so narrow minded but they thought they had accomplished a lot and they'd done 

209.56 211.37 A: (( ew [laughter] )) 

215.15 218.17 B: done me good [laughter] you know kind of thing 

216.27 218.01 A: yeah yeah 

218.25 219.26 B: whereas 

218.31 222.03 A: and and they're done now well thanks for trying 

220.68 225.97 B: yeah you know and of course back then um the legal age was twenty one 

225.68 226.72 A: mhm 

226.09 237.89 B: and i was only seventeen [laughter] so my mother was petrified what was she going to do with me for the next few [laughter] years you know kind of thing you know because she was still legally responsible for me and all that 

228.10 229.23 A: mhm 

231.14 232.33 A: mhm 

233.91 234.55 A: (( mhm )) 

237.71 238.61 A: right 

238.29 239.42 B: but um 

239.72 248.30 B: i ah i i just think i could have i could've applied myself a lot better and i like i said i would have done a different major something that 

246.33 247.27 A: yeah 

248.67 249.88 B: i you know i 

249.89 261.48 B: not that i don't use my psychology every single day in in life but it's real hard to get a job you don't get paid for it you know [laughter] but you know you don't get paid for 

253.13 254.00 A: mhm 

255.97 258.01 A: you don't get paid for it 

258.59 259.78 A: [laughter] 

259.95 263.66 A: yeah i'm actually going back to school 

263.70 268.39 A: to improve my g._p._a. so that i can go to grad school 

268.11 269.40 B: (( it wow )) 

269.02 273.60 A: so um i'm i'm doing a real good job of improving my g._p._a. 

273.62 279.35 A: but um that's definitely a should've would've could've kind of situation though 

278.95 283.73 B: are you going for a masters then in your same field in electrical engineering 

283.19 285.67 A: well um i'm going for 

285.83 289.90 A: um probably um depending on 

290.07 299.85 A: it's really iffy what i want to do whether it's electrical engineering or computer science depending on the school i apply to 

299.95 312.99 A: and so i'm getting a second bachelor's in computer science so that so that i can um have that option 'cause there's a lot of stuff that is just so very close between the two 

303.16 304.83 B: (( wow [laughter] )) 

313.04 314.12 B: (( [noise] [noise] do you )) 

313.22 317.39 A: but [mn] i haven't studied any of the computer science stuff 

317.21 318.33 B: wow 

317.59 318.24 A: (( so mhm )) 

318.80 327.13 B: i just i i work with computers every day and everything but the only thing i know is from trial and error [laughter] and and and believe it or not i 

324.69 326.19 A: yeah yeah 

327.02 335.70 B: over the years i i've gotten to where like the company i work for i am their first line software support [laughter] you know internal software 

333.28 336.32 A: [laughter] that's always exciting mhm 

335.49 343.71 B: you know the the computers not doing the right thing or my screen's crashing or this or that or and it's always me they call you know kinda thing 

343.31 344.36 A: right 

343.72 345.48 B: and it's like 

345.53 351.60 B: it's it kinda comes natural to me i enjoy [noise] it i enjoy the challenge ye- yeah 

348.62 352.23 A: it's very logical it's very logical 

352.23 359.61 B: yeah [noise] i'm the only person in my office that has an organized day [laughter] and i tell them i have to have it that way because otherwise i can't find 

355.05 356.57 A: [laughter] 

359.60 374.19 B: anything [laughter] you know and so um you know and i think a lot of people are intimidated by computers and intimidated by science and that sort of thing and it it's really not anything you know to be [noise] [noise] 

359.69 362.24 A: [laughter] uh-huh 

369.71 370.32 A: (( yes )) 

372.61 384.53 A: when when i was in college one of the things i did for spare cash was um tutoring students in maths specifically 

384.67 392.30 A: and one of the really interesting things i discovered is that every single one of them 

392.25 401.04 A: had a serious issue with not just math but with a specific math instructor 

401.00 402.22 B: wow 

401.34 408.22 A: everybody could put a name to tha instructor which really surprised me 

407.97 417.60 B: you know thinking back i i can i can put a name to one [laughter] yeah yeah and now you think it and now that you mention it that's w- that's interesting 

411.32 413.20 A: yep [laughter] yep 

414.71 415.71 A: uh-huh 

416.18 429.55 A: er yeah every single student i had and once once i was able to work with them and get that identified they were able to overcome it but until they were able to identify the source of why they hate maths 

429.69 433.54 A: um they they really continued to struggle 

429.72 430.74 B: (( mm )) 

434.04 434.84 A: but 

434.06 436.98 B: that's interesting that is an interesting theory 

437.40 438.98 B: (( to ah to )) 

437.45 446.00 A: yeah yeah ah it's it it was ah there are some people that um that hasn't been true i hear but 

446.25 449.37 A: i would i would typically deal with the people who're 

449.42 456.36 A: smarter in other areas and able to think logically they just had a maths problem 

456.84 457.84 A: so 

456.91 465.09 B: my my thing i was was if i did good in math i didn't do good in english if i did good in english i didn't do good in math i couldn't 

464.41 466.88 A: [laughter] you couldn't do both 

464.93 469.50 B: i couldn't concentrate i couldn't focus on both at the same time 

468.30 471.67 A: (( yeah [laughter] oh mhm mhm uh-huh )) 

469.43 480.59 B: [laughter] and and i tend to be that way as an adult is i can foc- i can if i need to really really focus on one thing um i can i'm really good at focussing in on something 

480.38 495.16 B: but everything else kinda falls to the side you know i kinda almost like total blinders which is good sometimes but then again you know in their in real life you've got lots of different things going on and you kinda have to give 

482.68 483.72 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

494.99 498.36 B: eq- equal attention to different things 

498.67 504.53 B: at any given time you can't just get real focussed on one thing and ignore everything else [laughter] 

504.24 506.24 A: (( right right )) 

505.53 506.09 B: (( [noise] )) 

506.29 516.90 B: but how long are we supposed to do this for [laughter] [laughter] yeah well this is the first one i mean i signed up for this a long time ago but this is the first one i've done so 

508.34 511.15 A: i have no idea [laughter] 

513.76 515.27 A: yeah i had to 

515.85 518.01 A: i had to beg for my pin 

517.66 530.86 B: i [laughter] i kept saying pin number pin number okay well i'll just it's probably the pin number i use for everything you know like for my bank account and stuff and it didn't work and it said that's an invalid pin [laughter] 

518.10 519.96 A: because [laughter] 

521.05 522.76 A: (( wh- where where )) 

524.96 527.89 A: uh-huh mhm i tried that too yeah 

528.17 529.40 A: (( [laughter] )) 

529.85 532.63 A: right right i was in exactly the same situation 

531.81 542.04 B: and then it was like okay where's my paperwork i just saw that the other day and was thinking about it so i run and i had printed out though like the application that that you did no where on there does it say a pin number i'm saying 

538.08 539.59 A: oh wow okay 

539.75 540.47 A: (( mhm oh )) 

541.53 542.65 A: (( yeah )) 

542.03 548.83 B: okay i had to have gotten an email from them [laughter] so real quick find it [laughter] 

545.29 546.55 A: [laughter] 

548.50 549.73 A: right 

549.56 550.91 B: but that's 

550.34 554.25 A: mm i wasn't terribly quick i'm i'm kind of pleased that they 

554.27 555.83 A: held on for me so 

555.11 558.15 B: yeah it gave us plenty of time to ah 

556.09 557.87 A: anyway um 

558.44 561.47 A: yes that is a good question how long have we been talking 

558.60 559.82 B: yeah 

561.57 562.40 A: [laughter] 

561.85 563.97 B: yeah 

562.95 564.01 A: okay 

564.23 568.69 A: um i i think they've had a few bugs with the research because 

564.27 565.48 B: you know and it doesn't 

568.33 569.37 B: really 

569.14 572.24 A: i i that would be my guess as to why 

572.93 574.87 A: [laughter] why it's been so long so 

574.22 581.02 B: [noise] well you know i might have had calls from them but i never know you know because it just comes up as unavailable 

581.26 582.21 B: um 

582.24 589.21 B: and i just happen to be expecting a phone call from someone else this evening [laughter] so when the phone rang i was kinda like oh hello and then it was like 

585.22 586.75 A: mhm [laughter] 

588.02 590.89 A: i i haven't received any other calls 

590.89 599.90 B: but i mean i don't know because i see unavailable you know like when it came up and i lots of times i see unavailable calls have come in on my phone when i haven't been 

591.37 591.95 A: (( mhm )) 

598.48 599.46 A: (( mhm ))
