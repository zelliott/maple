178.87 191.81 A: rainy and no leaves on the trees and things and it just you know it's the returning of life and all the blossoms and all that k- all that kind of good stuff so it would be hard to have health problems uh

220.63 229.87 A: to get uh to find out if they have asthma and get treated for it saying that the the treatment has improved a lot and they can help a lot more than they used to be able to 

229.49 232.08 B: yeah well plus and they have some 

232.30 233.37 B: um

243.87 245.52 B: through prescriptions so 

245.62 249.75 B: you know but a lot has to do also if you're overweight

277.79 278.99 B: it's working 

279.02 285.14 A: yeah i had i had no idea that was that that was related to to uh asthma 

285.21 294.07 A: um i think i think if i think about it maybe i maybe i can get uh more colds when it's going from 

294.08 305.05 A: fall into winter it's uh i think it's partly psychological maybe 'cause it's so it's so depressing 'cause it gets so it gets so dreary here in the winter 

297.92 299.67 B: it could be you know i was 

304.73 307.53 B: well you know what i was wondering if it was uh 

307.73 312.74 B: maybe psychosomatic or something because a lot of people just even when the holidays come 

313.25 317.05 B: they'll you know they get ill or it's a um

360.62 361.33 A: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

362.03 366.77 B: at&t for a little over four years and then i went to

379.14 379.73 A: (( [noise] )) 

380.77 384.55 B: and then um about a year um uh maybe two years ago 

384.65 387.70 B: no i guess three years ago in two thousand i quit 

388.45 395.73 B: and i was happy to do that [laughter] not because i didn't enjoy working on the phone but i couldn't stand working for pacific bell anymore 

388.69 389.94 A: (( mhm )) 

395.76 401.28 A: uh some companies can be uh can be um uh pretty bad sometimes 

400.31 414.19 B: oh they're it was it was terrible oh my gosh the thing is that no one could quit because they would pay so well and the benefits were so great that it you became so dependant on 

414.44 418.68 B: on working there i mean i i know everybody's dependant on their job but 

419.01 429.53 B: i- i- i don't know they even would make you think that [laughter] it was like the only thing you could do was it was crazy but it would not be 

429.82 437.51 B: you know i i i can't even tell you how many times i've seen people have a nervous break down at work and then the ambulance has to come and get them 

437.65 443.00 A: wow that's yeah no amount of money is worth uh worth that huh 

438.49 440.22 B: that's pretty bad 

442.25 444.26 B: [laughter] no it's not 

443.95 450.45 A: worse than worse than uh worse than uh the changes brought about by the seasons changes [laughter] chan- 

450.49 451.50 B: (( i know )) 

450.59 456.26 A: changes brought about about by uh by heavy handed uh management uh 

456.20 462.28 B: yeah you know it was just real stressful they used to monitor the calls all the time and i mean all the time 

456.44 457.31 A: so 

462.27 463.33 A: mhm 

462.54 468.03 B: and you because we were regulated by the p._u._c. we had all these guidelines it was just really really 

468.54 470.51 B: hard 

469.83 479.80 A: oh yeah i'm yeah that's quite i i worked for quest up here for a little bit and they're they're really bad they're re- you know questionable ethics and 

477.64 480.00 B: yeah they just expect perfection 

480.29 481.25 B: seems like 

480.43 485.57 A: mhm yeah i have a they cer- they certainly can 

485.75 486.96 A: so 

487.41 499.84 A: uh wh- where you where you are is there really um as far as this this season seasons thing is uh that much of a of a change in the seasons 

499.08 507.10 B: well you know we don't get all of you know our winters we don't really get a real winter we don't um 

507.62 511.95 B: we don't [noise] it just it doesn't it doesn't seem that das- that drastic 

512.05 513.16 B: um 

513.57 517.81 B: let me see well i know around december [laughter] november december 

517.90 520.45 B: i usually get sick [laughter] at that time 

519.69 520.79 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

520.85 528.93 B: and i think i don't know i think it's just because maybe the colder air is colder than usual usually where i live in my 

529.11 536.95 B: city it's it's a little warmer when it's colder when it's cool in l._a. it's colder here and when it's hot in l._a. it's w- a lot hotter here 

534.41 535.13 A: (( huh )) 

536.97 538.91 B: where i live in the valley 

537.22 538.24 A: so what's it

543.02 544.29 A: [cough] excuse me 

543.29 544.28 B: (( it's about let )) 

544.49 547.42 B: me see it can it can be anywhere from 

547.58 555.79 B: maybe seventy five for us it's really cold [laughter] and then it sounds like oh seventy five but [laughter] it's pretty cold 

555.86 562.49 B: for us um because we're used to being like maybe eighty five or eighty six degrees 

562.89 563.82 A: (( mm )) 

563.24 564.79 B: even in the winter 

565.49 569.99 A: so yeah i mean that's just so so different you would uh uh
