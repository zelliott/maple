72.62 73.98 A: (( yeah ah )) 

77.54 82.75 A: i'm in new york city [laughter] we have a little bit of junk [laughter] 

78.77 84.61 B: oh you're in new york okay well there you go [laughter] definitely plus it's cold as well so 

83.69 95.90 A: yeah that's true it's true and and the the heat the overheated apartments and all that although also i i've been a free lance uh writer and i've been a publicist and whatnot and i've gone back and forth between 

84.77 85.87 B: yeah 

88.10 89.18 B: yeah 

95.87 99.17 A: that and occasionally taking corporate work and they say when you go to a 

99.33 111.62 A: a place you know um where you're surrounded by other people you're it it increases and i have not been in a corporation this past year so maybe that is also a reason why i'm not getting a cold you know 

102.53 103.79 B: oh yeah 

109.26 116.15 B: oh that's right i wouldn't doubt it because i know well definitely offices the recycled air 

115.58 116.88 A: (( mhm )) 

116.26 120.52 B: um and also i was just on a airplane flight i went to brazil 

120.78 127.95 B: and right before i left 'cause the flight's supposed to be like twelve hours long and i'm like oh my god that's horrifying enough but 

127.14 128.34 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

127.88 138.11 B: if i end up getting a cold i'm gonna freak out so [laughter] so i got these little things like they're called airborne they're tablets and they're basically just like a little fizzy like super vitamin 

137.88 139.32 A: oh really 

138.57 146.47 B: but i'll tell you i did not get a cold and i think that's about the first time that i was on a airplane there and back and i did not get a cold 

145.83 147.92 A: (( that's excellent have to remember that )) 

146.57 153.98 B: usu- yeah usually i tot- i totally get cold so i just like try to dose myself with a ton of vitamins when i feel anything coming on 

152.95 154.46 A: mhm 

154.07 158.84 B: and i take a nap and so i don't usually see the doctor [laughter]

166.24 166.99 A: [laughter] 

169.63 176.67 A: yeah well maybe maybe it's my body's rallying for the really big stuff to come down down the pike as they say [laughter] 

171.44 172.52 B: maybe 

175.43 179.08 B: yeah maybe you've had all the viruses [laughter] 

177.04 182.79 A: [laughter] yeah that's right and you run out of them after a while [laughter] [laughter] 

180.97 188.27 B: that'd be great no [laughter] i have no idea but now they say there's all these you know new things coming out and and 

188.25 200.03 B: i i have a girlfriend that's actually a nurse and uh she says that what they think is happening 'cause there's always like super viruses coming out and that's why they last so long and that because there's so much international air travel 

199.72 201.27 A: ah 

200.13 208.89 B: that all these things are mixing and it's you know smarter smarter but anyway i went to brazil and i didn't get anything so i'm happy yeah

226.86 227.99 A: mhm 

227.43 237.18 B: something like that harvard or yale and they were doing a study on him on spiritual healers and uh so i figured if i got a cold on the way there [laughter] 

233.87 238.34 A: (( [laughter] don't trust the city to have one [laughter] )) 

237.67 242.39 B: (( it was like yahoo [laughter] i'll be getting rid of that thing fast ))

267.43 268.69 B: nicaragua 

270.27 273.29 A: [mn] wow the memories already starting it's [laughter] let's see 

272.24 274.39 B: el salvador then where 

274.01 287.02 A: uh el salvador el salvador el salvador right right right and that was that was it well u._n._i._c._e._f. um which uh you know is bureaucratic like every other organisation but they they they managed something that was really cool which was during the 

275.44 277.41 B: el salvador oh my goodness 

277.44 278.45 B: wow 

287.16 299.73 A: the war went on for a long time and um children were not getting vaccinated and all the work that u._n._i._c._e._f. had done was beginning to you know be in jeopardy so they they went to the church there and they went to the um 

296.05 296.73 B: mm 

300.13 304.78 A: uh both sides you know the the rebels as well as the government and the and through the 

304.95 308.25 A: (( intermedi- intermediary church they )) 

308.26 311.09 A: called for a twenty four hour cease fire 

311.24 320.28 A: and everybody stopped and children got vaccinated and even the soldiers we have pictures of the soldiers um helping to you know vaccinate 

311.56 312.54 B: wow 

320.08 333.19 A: and then as soon as that was over they picked [laughter] up their guns and started shooting each other i mean it shows you how crazy people are i mean they're [laughter] so i say if women were running things you know there'll be none of this war nonsense we just wouldn't do it 

323.64 325.14 B: oh no 

326.19 327.84 B: [laughter] 

330.01 331.20 B: [laughter] 

331.66 341.73 B: well that's ex- that's exactly the point [laughter] that's why they keep us out of like oh i shouldn't say this over the phone on a study i might get hunted down 

338.59 343.58 A: [laughter] [laughter] yeah we're being recorded we're being [laughter] 

342.00 354.81 B: [laughter] we could really get into this but that's exactly why they keep women out of stuff like that they wanna be little war heroes or something i dunno probably whoever's studying us right now is having a good laugh 

344.93 346.00 A: [laughter] 

348.19 349.32 A: (( exactly [laughter] )) 

350.79 351.90 A: (( that's right [laughter] )) 

355.40 365.47 A: [laughter] but i i loved the el salvador people they were really really they're such such they had i mean compared to what you know we strive to have in terms of material things you could say that they had practically nothing 

355.51 357.27 B: but yeah that's pretty funny 

365.26 366.25 B: yeah 

365.48 366.54 A: but they 

366.43 379.24 A: the families they loved each other they seemed so genuinely happy with each other and um my children at the time were you know fairly young and they'd get their thing you know what was school like today uh it's boring and like everything was boring and went through that stage and 

368.15 369.23 B: yeah 

379.07 379.84 B: mm 

379.13 384.43 A: these children were sitting waiting for their teacher and she had to walk like three miles across you know rocky 

384.56 390.83 A: terrain and they're sitting there and all they have are pencils and and you know little barely scraps of paper and 

384.66 385.44 B: (( [mn] )) 

390.72 404.11 A: they jump to their feet when she arrived and and they were like thrilled of to have a teacher and they were just hung on to every word and i'm thinking my my ratty children if they could just appreciate what they have and now they're grown up they do but i mean you know 

396.30 397.17 B: yeah 

401.52 403.00 B: yeah it's 

403.62 408.44 B: i think it's it is like a it it's like if you have it too easy 

408.16 409.45 A: (( mhm )) 

408.76 421.64 B: then you really just don't appreciate anything and and uh there's also a lot of lot of anger i think in this country 'cause i've been down to costa rica and i notice the same thing people are extremely what we would call poor 

421.17 422.19 A: mhm 

421.58 432.91 B: but they were so happy and they were so nice like they would never let anything bad happen to you they're always watching out for you even though they don't let you think they are but they'll watch out for you 

423.24 424.74 A: exactly 

425.25 427.14 A: (( [laughter] exactly [laughter] )) 

429.00 430.15 A: mhm 

432.86 443.78 B: and they were so nice and i was like wow people like talk to each other how 'bout that [laughter] but it's almost funny that it's it's kinda weird and it's like 

439.42 440.55 A: (( yeah [laughter] [mn] )) 

444.36 445.90 B: it's just bizarre 

445.61 446.74 A: it is 

446.14 454.48 B: it's the way it should be i really think you know [laughter] um uh i came out to l._a. to do acting and singing um 

448.96 450.15 A: so what do you do 

454.80 463.68 B: so gee what am i doing yeah it's kinda interesting it's been it's been pretty cool out here like i've had some really amazing things happen 

455.59 456.62 A: (( cool )) 

463.93 468.91 B: but i haven't fulfilled my dream completely at all so you know but um 

466.94 467.83 A: (( mm )) 

469.30 470.16 B: it's 

469.45 471.17 A: but you're staying with it 

470.83 472.40 B: yeah what's that 

471.68 473.37 A: you're staying with it 

473.04 478.03 B: ah for a little while yeah um i'm getting to the point where i'm kinda like well 

474.86 475.68 A: (( yeah )) 

477.90 489.26 B: okay [laughter] something something needs to really happen to really keep me here because um i'm just getting tired of the city and stuff like that i i really like like going to south america and stuff like that people i think are much cooler 

478.52 480.73 A: [laughter] 

483.74 484.78 A: (( oh mhm )) 

489.35 493.63 B: and and it seriously is like we have to stick on the cold topic but 

493.36 494.69 A: [laughter] all right 

493.93 504.65 B: i'm like afraid of these colds that come a by i mean they're scary and now with the sars thing they're getting even scarier [laughter] my god they're like getting deadly 

500.19 503.23 A: yeah yeah exactly um well 

504.13 513.99 A: well used to be a cold was something for me that would last ab- you know maybe twenty four hours at the most but there's a there's another kinda cold that's really kinda vicious think like a super cold and 

513.36 514.92 B: the flu or 

514.64 524.25 A: no it's actually a cold and and it just seemed to hang on that was a few years ago and and i occasionally i'd talk and a couple a people would say god i've had this cold for so long i 

515.12 516.29 B: oh just now 

518.85 519.90 B: oh 

524.21 533.32 A: and after talking to people over a period of time and i guess the next time i was vi- visiting my doctor regular check up kind of thing i topic i think might have come up he'd say oh there is a 

533.43 542.00 A: a different kind of cold that's like a you know that's like a week long cold and it and it's it's but i don't i don't know colds are 

538.31 539.23 B: mm 

542.33 548.68 A: you know viruses or not but uh i should know this but i know they can't be cured by antibiotics right therefore 

548.24 551.06 B: no they can't they kinda just boost up your system 

548.83 549.77 A: they're 

550.54 553.04 A: right that's all they can do yeah 

551.70 566.61 B: but you know one time okay like the last really bad cold that came through here was about two and a half to three years ago and i'm wondering if that's the same one you're talking about but it lasted for me about two and a half weeks and then after about after about two and a half weeks it went down to my lungs 

562.21 564.00 A: yeah yeah 

566.72 570.75 B: and you know it goes into your head and your throat and in your chest and 

569.52 571.22 A: and a horrible cough right 

570.78 578.11 B: i thought oh it must be gone 'cause nothing happened for like two or three days then all of a sudden i started noticing that i couldn't take a full breath 

577.81 580.99 A: oh oh gee 

578.00 592.23 B: and i started to br- i couldn't breathe i'd get it my my lung capacity got smaller and smaller and i'm like okay i'm going to die soon [laughter] and i'm talking like this i'll be going and i couldn't cough anything up nothing was coming up it was just growing in my lungs 

585.56 586.55 A: [laughter] 

592.23 596.24 B: and um at the same time this woman from my church says to me
