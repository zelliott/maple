6.89 10.48 A: yeah [laughter] a first for me [laughter] 

9.90 12.37 B: oh same here how did you hear about it 

11.83 14.27 A: um uh my daughter actually 

13.62 18.00 B: oh i f- yeah i found out through my wife actually she uh referred me 

16.99 19.06 A: uh uh okay 

18.40 21.46 B: uh so did you hear the topic of conversation 

20.89 28.57 A: well i was trying to remember what the personal habits that we're supposed to decide which is worst or talk about which is worse 

26.58 27.75 B: correct yes 

27.91 30.73 B: which is worse out of a list of five i think it was 

30.21 34.62 A: oh you counted that's better than me i was answering a fedex at the same time 

31.09 35.25 B: yeah [laughter] [laughter] 

34.94 41.73 A: um [laughter] uh the only one that caught my eye blatantly was smoking but that's because 'cause i 

40.01 43.61 B: smoking okay well i wholeheartedly agree on that one [laughter] 

42.64 48.98 A: i don't i don't smoke and i i get rather irritated at uh people who think that's a 

49.03 50.13 A: (( a uh )) 

50.19 51.35 A: a right 

51.42 56.39 B: i agree because you know it impinges on people you know that are in the vicinity of you 

56.39 57.67 A: yeah 

57.00 66.88 B: i think so and um well i live here in new york and they actually just proposed a non smoking ban on all bars and i couldn't you know be happier about that agreement [laughter] 

65.48 67.74 A: well they did that here in colorado too 

66.89 68.24 B: oh they did okay 

67.93 75.02 A: but uh it was supposed to take effect january first and instead what happened was 

75.08 78.83 A: i i think a whole coalition of marlborough men showed up 

78.11 79.94 B: mhm oh i see [laughter] 

78.87 88.18 A: and uh [laughter] overturned it uh basically put it on hold so it has it has they have to go back and collect it 'cause ess- it was basically 

83.95 85.22 B: oh wow 

88.22 93.87 A: different city councils like denver colorado springs pueblo passed it those are three major cities 

93.26 94.78 B: that's right yes 

94.17 104.89 A: in colorado and uh uh my understanding is pueblo's is still in a- they did take theirs into affect because they didn't have a a large enough signatory to to turn overturn the 

100.18 101.44 B: mm okay 

105.08 108.21 A: to get city council turn it back but i'm not sure 

108.23 116.85 A: but denver and colorado springs forget it i mean the people just swamped city hall and they decided to put it on hold to get the signatures put but it uh 

115.81 117.11 B: oh is that right 

116.99 118.16 A: yeah so it's 

117.41 121.92 B: wow 'cause i always thought of denver as being a very um health conscious city 

119.93 120.92 A: [sigh] 

122.46 127.94 B: actually i think a lot of people you know love the outdoors there you know you would think they would be all for it 

128.09 129.93 A: o- have you ever been to denver 

128.53 134.41 B: like i i well actually i ski all the time in denver i'm i'm a avid skier and snowboarder 

133.81 138.59 A: oh 'cause certain times of the year the pollution the air pollution is so horrible 

137.99 139.85 B: oh is that right yeah 

138.69 146.79 A: and uh up until about ten years ago the air pollution was just a huge huge smog over the city 

146.19 147.06 B: mm 

146.81 150.16 A: and uh really they had to 

149.59 151.14 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

150.26 151.30 A: um 

151.75 166.21 A: enact a whole bunch of uh laws to try to cut down on some of the pollution and start cleaning up business and that's changed so now we don't see the smog nearly so much but it was ugly it was you couldn't see the i mean you'd see yellow mountains i mean it was terrible 

161.32 162.47 B: oh that's good 

166.25 174.51 A: uh but they've done a good job turning it around so but i would've thought they would've uh enacted the no smoking in the bars too but they didn't but there are some 

174.60 181.44 A: restaurants that because their national chains have opted to adopt that policy 

180.75 182.03 B: oh okay 

181.69 185.05 A: and so those do exist independently here 

185.28 189.30 A: but uh trying to get into one of them [laughter] for a meal 

188.72 190.86 B: that's right [laughter] 

189.36 201.50 A: i- is at least an hour away they're very popular because of that they have big signs as you enter saying uh this is a no smoking property so like the outback restaurants are w- are a chain 

193.12 194.08 B: yeah 

200.58 203.23 B: oh the steakhouse right yeah 

201.75 207.14 A: yeah that's a whole chain and the whole chain nationwide is no smoking throughout the whole restaurant and bar 

206.97 212.35 B: yeah the law went into effect here on april first so all bars and restaurants are off limits for smoking nowadays 

212.23 215.93 A: well that'll make visiting new york in september more pleasant for me 

215.12 220.04 B: oh are you coming in september yeah you'll love it here [laughter] it's the best weather wise too in september 

216.18 217.58 A: yeah [laughter] 

219.78 224.03 A: oh well that's not my friend that's not what my friends are telling me given all the snow 

223.65 227.98 B: yeah it's it's quite humid in september but it doesn't rain that much so that's a good thing 

227.56 229.04 A: oh it's a good time 

228.52 238.88 B: yeah that's so it's a good time to come and you'll breathe easier in the bars [laughter] and the restaurants [laughter] it's funny because you see a lot of people congregating nowadays in the in the front entrance 

230.09 231.82 A: okay that sounds great 

233.01 235.56 A: [laughter] 

238.92 249.09 A: well you know and i yeah that's that's kinda way it is in the no smoking restaurants around here but i came from california last year and so i was very accustomed to no smoking 

241.81 243.45 B: yeah 

245.69 246.91 B: oh okay 

249.32 255.59 A: i mean and nobody even gives it a second thought there's a small disgruntled crowd that doesn't like it 

254.95 256.20 B: yeah that's right 

255.80 257.17 A: but it's small 

257.26 261.09 A: i mean smoke- smoking isn't isn't uh 

257.32 259.09 B: yes very much so 

261.21 275.73 A: uh looked at very highly there so it's it's it's really the opposite it's the kids are frowned on from starting smoking i mean it's huge and my understanding is i read a i think i read a research report that showed that uh 

275.73 284.48 A: uh some of the disease issues associated with cancer th- i mean um with smoking has significantly dropped but i don't i don't know if that's for sure 

284.29 286.76 B: [laughter] hm yeah i i didn't read about that but 

284.85 285.71 A: uh 

286.59 287.64 A: yeah they 

286.97 291.47 B: i'd be surprised though you know because i think that smoking is on the on the rise actually 

291.37 298.68 A: yeah well you won't find it in any public any public place actually in california it's so pleasant 

293.94 294.72 B: (( [noise] )) 

295.82 297.36 B: right [laughter] 

297.99 299.88 B: are you originally from california 

299.57 309.35 A: no no i j- i was just a transplant there from oregon to colorado to to california and that was one of the pleasant surprises in moving to california 

307.79 308.64 B: (( oh oh )) 

308.73 312.35 B: that's nice yeah i'm originally from california the san francisco bay area 

312.02 313.48 A: (( huh )) 

312.83 323.34 B: yes and miss it you know i wish i i think i'll probably go back one day you know to start a family 'cause you know it's hard to live in the city in new york and and raise kids here [laughter] 

322.76 328.03 A: yeah well san francisco's nice i was there just a few months ago 

323.93 325.34 B: it's really tough 

327.32 328.81 B: yeah i love it there 

328.62 332.92 A: yeah that's nice well i don't even remember what the other vices were what were they 

332.21 337.36 B: well the other ones were uh lack of exercise uh eating poorly 

337.65 343.15 B: uh drinking excessively and i forgot what the first one was but you know those are 

343.58 348.27 B: you know those can only harm the p- the person that does yourself right they won't 

345.27 346.48 A: yourself 

347.60 349.47 A: well actually that's not true 

349.08 351.17 B: well your loved ones too that's true 

350.44 354.18 A: well your loved ones and then also as you enter the health care system 

351.42 352.36 B: right 

354.25 361.79 A: [laughter] because of the outpouring uh uh then it does cost us all it can only harm 

356.93 358.13 B: that's right 

359.75 360.64 B: correct 

361.90 367.94 A: the person who has it specifically but it can cost society tremendously 

366.56 368.69 B: yes a bundle right [laughter] 

367.83 377.70 A: yeah a bundle a bundle especially uh eating wrong and and or or eating poorly and no exercise because they'll just increase the old uh 

377.72 381.82 A: heart attack factor and that just that's very expensive 

378.83 380.61 B: yeah that's right 

381.68 387.25 B: and that's a tough issue to solve too because you know it it is free will people are are free to do whatever they want 

387.02 388.30 A: absolutely 

387.84 388.84 B: so 

388.82 394.95 A: absolutely so then what do you think of the healthy people campaign that the n._i._h. keeps trying to 

394.35 395.71 B: [laughter] 

395.59 398.40 A: i think for a the last decade they've been trying to 

398.82 404.84 A: ground swell this healthy people campaign and i've yet to see any advertising in any city anywhere 

402.85 411.02 B: yeah i i've yet to see it i think they're just they're being inundated with all the [laughter] i i don't think it'll 

409.96 416.30 A: they spend a lot of money but everything just seems to me it goes down in paper or printed somewhere and i don't see the programs so 

415.63 417.07 B: (( yeah neither do i )) 

416.93 427.35 A: [laughter] so i kinda wondered about that and yet they then they get plaud- applauded for creating programs but i keep thinking is it is it really a worthwhile program if nobody joins in 

417.54 419.06 B: [laughter] 

427.22 428.78 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

428.16 431.20 A: (( hm it's a paper trave )) 

430.87 432.48 B: yep 

431.41 433.03 A: that's all it is 

433.35 438.60 A: but you're right doesn't hurt anybody although i do appreciate healthy people period 

438.73 442.25 B: yeah i think they're more pleasant to be around [laughter] 

441.44 446.85 A: well i do too 'cause i think it a- affects your mental disposition well certainly if you're not exercising 

444.69 445.54 B: sure 

447.53 451.65 A: you're not sending off any of those happy hormones to the brain on a daily basis 

450.19 457.91 B: of course right i mean they said that one of the the best way to combat depression and you know mental illness is to exercise and to eat right 

457.52 458.61 A: yeah 

457.97 462.73 B: yeah y- that's right the endorphins that you release i think that that those help tremendous- 

461.38 464.85 A: yeah so if more people exercise we'd have a happier world 

464.13 466.82 B: yeah that's right [laughter] 

465.88 468.16 A: [laughter] 

467.68 469.90 B: do you engage in a lot of physical activity 

469.51 473.41 A: um i usually do work out at least four or five times a week i 

472.65 474.10 B: oh good good for you 

473.66 475.23 A: yeah how about you 

474.74 478.97 B: yeah i try to do that i belong to a gym and i play tennis outdoors here in central park 

478.80 480.12 A: oh how nice 

479.50 483.48 B: yeah it's very it's a beautiful day today it's about seventy two and sunny today here in new york 

483.13 489.66 A: wow we've got very overcast and about sixty or fifty five outside 

484.44 485.67 B: very nice 

488.03 488.86 B: (( well f- )) 

489.10 492.00 B: well for once we're warmer than you [laughter] 

491.52 505.27 A: yeah well the w- our weather's been playing tricks on us 'cause yesterday it was like seventy five it was gorgeous and and then two days ago it snowed so [laughter] it can't decide what it wants to do i keep thinking today should i plant flowers 

495.79 497.13 B: oh wow okay 

499.10 500.66 B: [laughter] 

505.90 509.21 B: mm [laughter] leave it [laughter] 

506.35 514.41 A: ah think i'll wait another week [laughter] but that's the way this state is i mean we've had snow as late as the last week of may 

514.10 517.91 B: that's but the resorts are are they still open or are they closed the ski resorts 

516.86 522.66 A: n- no i think they're open 'cause they've just they got a whole bunch more snow within the last week or two i i saw 

520.29 521.54 B: wow okay 

522.73 528.14 A: uh i saw a lot of skiing i mean they always you know put that on the news whenever they get some fresh powder 

527.66 528.98 B: right 

528.35 534.50 A: so i i think within just the last week or so 'cause we got snow at the lower elevation it just disappears but at the higher elevation 

534.52 539.79 A: it was uh good enough that they were actually trying to get people up on the slopes 

540.04 545.48 A: but uh you know ironically of all the exercise i could possibly do in this state that's the one i don't do 

544.67 546.62 B: (( mm [laughter] )) 

545.89 547.52 A: (( [laughter] )) 

547.79 549.52 A: (( like uh [laughter] )) 

549.54 554.18 A: i don't know [laughter] going down a hill at a very [laughter] fast speed 

553.68 556.25 B: [laughter] sounds kinda [laughter] 

555.38 566.12 A: yeah this this is not the exercise that i think it would be and then and then a few people i've known who've broken collar bones or or multiple fractures in the legs it just scares me 

558.32 559.56 B: [laughter] 

562.46 564.33 B: or wrists yep 

565.92 567.68 B: yeah my wife just uh 

567.89 571.91 B: tore her ligaments in her knee this season snow boarding with me 

571.13 572.76 A: [laughter] oh 

572.06 577.49 B: yeah it was a freak accident she slipped on a patch of ice and went down pretty hard and you know that that was it 

577.82 580.07 A: (( ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch ouch )) 

579.25 585.62 B: yeah so she's on she was on crutches for the first month and now she's uh you know in rehab physical therapy 

585.97 587.61 A: (( wow )) 

586.99 591.38 B: maybe you know maybe skiing should be one of the [laughter] dangerous activities [laughter] 

590.36 599.89 A: well and it bothers me you know if you take it up when you're younger it y- then even if you have accidents you heal well and fast but the older y- older you are and when you're 

596.77 598.51 B: yeah exactly
