0.65 2.77 B: hello this is my name's christine 

2.34 4.61 A: hi christine i'm sheryl how are you 

4.53 11.39 B: i'm doing really good [laughter] um well personal habits and they're talking about all those different ones you know 

5.68 6.78 A: good 

11.25 12.45 A: yeah 

11.50 12.30 B: um 

12.51 19.50 B: i was just thinking to myself um just because of my own belief system i would say a lot of them are equal in 

19.59 22.63 B: in not okay i wouldn't say that um 

22.76 28.12 B: i wouldn't i wouldn't class you know not working out as one of those gossiping and 

28.15 29.78 A: yeah i 

28.22 30.17 B: and smoking and 

30.78 40.14 A: agree i agree um i guess i guess they're all harmful in in some way but it depends upon how you look at it i guess 

40.37 48.10 B: right i mean and it and it would probably depend on the attitude you know in not working out too i mean if you're not working out just because you don't have the time and you know 

47.90 61.93 B: schedule or whatever you're not you you're actually directly like i'm not trying to work out then really it's not i guess it'd be a heart issue heart issues or goss- gossiping is usually because you want to um you want to blurt other information about other people 

52.87 53.88 A: mhm 

62.01 63.69 A: right right 

62.68 69.93 B: heart issue with smoking is typically because you need something to [laughter] that you think will can you know help you de-stress and 

70.02 71.02 B: whatever 

70.66 75.07 A: right right yeah they're all different in that way but um 

75.20 84.57 A: yeah i i agree it's um though they say you can make time for more working out but i don't know [laughter] i haven't [laughter] 

82.53 88.51 B: [laughter] no oh well we have a day care and a bunch of little kids and um 

87.56 89.83 A: i can hear them in the background 

89.66 92.15 B: (( yeah there's quite few of them )) 

91.84 94.21 A: they're kind of your workout aren't they huh 

94.18 98.39 B: oh i definitely run around with them all quite a bit [laughter] 

96.42 101.67 A: [laughter] oh that's great oh now where are you calling from 

101.78 103.45 B: i'm calling from oregon 

103.05 106.05 A: oregon okay i'm in ah southern california 

105.72 108.00 B: okay yep i used to live over there 

108.10 109.00 A: oh 

109.88 115.31 A: well i guess i think ah one of the more harmful ones that i can remember from the list 

115.44 117.82 A: is gossiping um 

116.98 118.21 B: yeah me too 

119.18 126.43 A: you know i don't think that benefits anybody really and it just you know it just hurts it can end biting you in the b- 

126.44 130.78 A: back i guess and ah ends up hurting a lot more people than 

126.50 127.18 B: (( [laughter] )) 

131.41 134.85 A: than i guess it helps any if that makes sense 

134.75 141.65 B: right yeah i think that's a really bad one too it's just it's wise to keep your tongue and watch what you say 

137.39 139.22 A: yeah 

142.14 144.38 B: about other people so 

143.26 146.01 A: yeah if if you can't say something nice 

144.61 151.25 B: i'd say i think that was one of the worst that i can remember too is just because that one you really do have total control on 

151.21 159.03 A: that's true that's true you're absolutely right you're the one that ah that creates it for yourself that that makes sense 

158.71 164.04 B: because i can see people that smoke you know some you know they have an addiction so addictions are hard to break 

163.64 165.33 A: yeah they are 

164.42 172.33 B: so i wouldn't necessarily think it's a great thing and i wouldn't you know want somebody blowing smoke in my face but i'm not going to you know i wouldn't judge a person because they did it either 

171.82 173.27 A: right right 

172.50 179.10 B: um whereas i may stay away from somebody a lot more because they continue to gossip or talk about me or someone else 

179.09 180.64 A: right because they couldn't 

179.28 181.00 B: (( that really concerns you )) 

180.84 189.76 A: yeah well i mean you figure if they're talking about other people to you then chances are they're probably talking about you to other people as well so 

189.04 195.16 B: right the same way with the the not working out i mean i don't think i would stay away from a person just because they don't work out yeah i 

194.26 199.18 A: no [laughter] that makes sense i know i know 

196.47 197.28 B: (( don't )) 

199.13 203.78 B: remember any of the other topics the ones that they said because it comes out pretty quick 

203.18 205.44 A: ah i know it does and ah 

205.43 214.13 A: my boss was talking to me as as they were going by so [laughter] but um well what else the working out yeah that is 

209.76 210.90 B: yeah 

213.89 221.14 A: you know it's it's a question they say of choice but um you know i think it's just a question of time as well you know there just 

220.46 225.06 B: right and the majority of are extremely busy nowadays so 

224.49 226.53 A: yeah yeah that's true 

226.57 238.12 A: and um i mean i know i have a three year old son and by the time you know i'm up at the break of dawn and then by the time i go to work and come home and pick him up really there literally is no time in the day 

238.10 239.57 B: yeah 

238.14 244.47 A: poss- you know i want to spend as much time as i can with him and then that sort of you know takes away from it mhm 

242.83 247.13 B: i understand i have a three a five a seven and a nine year old 

245.39 246.01 A: (( argh )) 

246.62 248.26 A: (( oh my )) 

247.29 249.22 B: my three year old's a girl 

248.89 250.51 A: oh my goodness 

249.47 254.93 B: and then like i said we do the daycare so we typically have about five other kids here 

254.62 255.38 A: oh 

255.33 257.40 B: majority of the day [laughter] 

257.11 258.78 A: my well you 

257.90 268.79 B: so when they go home then i see my kids and that's just not going to allow me have my own personal time [laughter] and um so once they go to bed then i'm too pooped to do any you know total exercising 

261.85 263.83 A: no no 

268.39 269.48 A: yeah 

268.75 275.76 B: it's probably one of those things that has to be a planned agenda and you know it's kind of like going on a date [laughter] 

273.93 285.01 A: well it is it's it's when you have ah four kids i mean you it's spontaneous it just doesn't happen you have to plan absolutely and then even your best laid plans probably 

285.38 292.53 A: you know get changed around and whatnot just very easily just by the nature of four kids oh my goodness mhm 

291.64 295.02 B: well yeah i was looking at the cost of some places to um 

295.03 303.77 B: you know go workout and and getting membership in some of those alone can kind of be spendy but um so you add the child care on top of that 

300.62 301.67 A: yeah 

303.55 305.34 A: right right 

304.18 306.60 B: and it's just like huh yeah 

305.64 317.11 A: yeah yeah i know and i think you know in i think you can get just as many benefits at home you know whether you're going on a walk with your kids or or you know just 

317.35 321.63 A: buying a treadmill or something like they're so inexpensive these days 

319.20 320.50 B: right 

321.74 330.58 A: or an exercise bike when you're watching t._v. or whenever you have a little free time you know so i know i think you can get the same amount of benefits 

330.85 332.19 B: (( yeah me too )) 

331.46 334.01 A: without having to pay the monthly fee 

334.31 335.46 A: that's true 

334.53 340.65 B: well we have stairs so if i've done something like if if i have ten minutes then i'll just run up and down the stairs as many times as i can 

340.17 354.22 A: [laughter] oh yeah i know we do too but ah boy you're probably running up those stairs much more than i am [laughter] wow oh my goodness well you're you're certainly busy 

341.59 343.17 B: [laughter] 

354.26 357.60 A: i'm trying to think ah some more personal habits 

357.95 359.72 B: personal bad habits i 

359.96 364.63 B: i don't know i mean lying and cheating obviously those categories can kind of be up there with 

365.00 366.10 B: gossiping 

365.82 367.79 A: mhm mhm 

367.65 370.51 B: i guess i don't know if you're a religious person or not 

370.68 371.96 A: i am yes 

371.78 378.57 B: but i would say probably anything that is listed in the bible would definitely be something that i would not be for [laughter] 

378.46 380.69 A: oh really uh-huh yes yes 

378.79 379.96 B: (( yeah )) 

380.08 386.32 B: and then those issue that they kind of named that weren't listed in the bible then i probably wouldn't care about too much [laughter] 

384.76 389.59 A: [laughter] that's true yes i kind of i feel that way as well 

389.63 395.84 A: um that you kind of you know and and everybody has a different value system that's true but ah 

389.81 390.67 B: so 

395.87 397.32 A: i like um 

397.81 405.72 A: you know i agree with you in terms of certain things you can you do have complete control over and then some less so 

404.56 405.68 B: right 

405.81 408.47 A: absolutely absolutely 

406.12 407.05 B: (( well )) 

408.62 411.44 A: but um yeah i um 

412.31 413.96 A: you know i've been 

414.56 427.85 B: when we're building you know just with the nine year old we're working on a lot of character issues with him yeah and um they sh- they show him the negative ones and i show him those positive ones all over the place and um 

419.78 420.98 A: yeah 

424.83 425.89 A: yeah 

428.56 433.77 B: i can just say that it's more pleasant to be around someone i know that he is 

435.03 441.05 B: he is i mean just you know the watching his mouth and watching how he speaks to others and 

440.27 441.43 A: right 

441.40 442.20 B: (( i'm going )) 

442.04 452.63 A: well you certainly want good influences you know as opposed to bad [noise] there's so many so many so much negativity and so many negative influences out there and that it's ah 

445.16 446.62 B: (( to have )) 

452.80 454.47 A: you know sometimes 

454.09 461.18 B: to pick up this crying baby just 'cause somebody is watching my door and she's going to think that i'm she's going to see that a person's come to get her 

455.70 456.68 A: okay 

460.49 462.39 A: no problem do what you have to do 

462.50 463.52 A: [laughter] 

464.37 467.13 A: oh but um [noise] 

465.43 468.76 B: [laughter] she doesn't like other people um 

469.34 474.11 B: she doesn't like she doesn't like to think that someone else is going to pick her up besides me 

473.41 475.64 A: oh well 

475.79 480.42 A: that shows that you're a loving person [laughter] she must have complete confidence in you 

482.13 485.08 A: oh but i know now do they teach 

485.15 487.50 A: i know some schools do these 

487.57 491.61 A: character building courses or they try to um 

491.84 495.77 A: you know included in the curriculum is that the case with your son 

496.18 508.68 B: um well actually i've just taken him out of school i home schooled him recently because i just because he's been making a lot of bad choices with the and refusing to hang around with and so 

500.54 501.82 A: oh wow 

506.46 507.40 A: mhm 

509.35 512.89 B: well it's just amazing how sometimes you get on the phone and then everybody goes down hill 

511.74 513.96 A: [laughter] 

514.62 522.64 A: oh now how is is that working out do you are you um are you finding an improvement or i guess it's it's only been a short time 

521.19 526.50 B: yeah in attitudes very much so and really in behavior very much so and 

526.61 530.39 B: um i've home schooled them all th- all but this last year 

529.85 530.84 A: mhm 

532.39 533.79 B: and so we 

534.00 538.50 B: (( tried [noise] )) 

540.04 546.54 B: um we tried to put him back in because we thought it would give him more social liaison or whatever 

546.13 547.17 A: right 

547.09 548.41 B: and um 

548.54 556.48 B: not that he didn't get a lot of it already because he was going to all kinds of like t._e. he was going to computer classes and church and 

556.33 565.55 B: and all kinds of different things and so we thought okay well you know maybe we'll just give him a little bit of time he's starting to get older and he just kind of chose to hang round the kids with the 

558.17 559.42 A: right 

565.65 567.76 B: the wrong habits 

566.97 568.88 A: oh well 

569.71 570.66 A: (( no you can't )) 

569.78 581.77 B: and that's something you can't really monitor too much while they're there my goal and my thought were taking him out of school to home school him again for a little while longer is just to really try to continue to pray for him 

572.43 573.49 A: (( mhm )) 

581.82 590.59 B: and try to get him to properly understand to make life easier he just really needs to start making some wise choices on his own 

589.23 590.13 A: right 

590.60 594.33 B: he obviously wasn't kind of protecting his heart um 

594.40 598.54 B: and so my thought is right now we'll protect his heart and continue to train him to do it himself 

598.32 599.89 A: yeah yeah
