63.49 64.26 B: yet 

63.63 67.92 A: do you they said when you have a cold how long do you wait before you go to the doctor 

68.74 75.73 B: actually i i don't usually i just buy over the counter stuff and treat it that way 

76.61 81.60 A: i do too and then after a week if it doesn't go away then usually then i'll call 

84.47 96.92 B: i don't whenever you know i know that usually most people most of the people i work with do the same thing but and i usually have to be on almost on death's door before i go to the doctor which i know isn't right but 

97.10 100.45 A: it seems like most guys are that way more that way 

101.95 110.58 B: then i've got sick days at work that i usually don't use them up at all i just on a personal basis i just use them that way i use them whenever i want 

110.77 112.56 A: that would be nice [laughter] 

112.58 114.92 A: if you didn't have to use them for sickness 

116.92 120.87 B: [laughter] well i keep a couple in reserve till uh till um 

121.99 129.95 B: till the end of the year and then if then um well they carry over but it's it's enough that that way at least i got a couple just in case do 

128.77 131.23 A: yes because a person never knows 

133.44 137.63 A: i'm pretty lucky there too don't catch a lot of colds and flu 

139.87 146.53 B: you know the recording said what about seven days what what were they saying that they said there's we we are not uh not they're saying uh what seven days 

146.57 150.94 A: whether how soon you go to the doctor when you catch a cold 

149.63 150.32 B: oh 

154.58 156.77 A: after seven days then i go 

158.13 159.47 A: about a week 

162.14 166.96 B: usually every time i do try to go to the doctor and i'm feeling better than i also when i'm feeling better 

167.51 169.02 B: just when i got ready to go 

168.89 169.51 A: (( [laughter] )) 

169.11 172.39 B: [laughter] that's probably psychological i know but 

173.73 179.07 A: maybe not you know maybe you wait so long that it really does start going away 

181.31 186.85 A: i get bronchitis though if i wait too long have you ever had that 

186.51 189.24 B: i think once a couple of years ago but then i never 

189.95 194.33 B: went to the doctor for that either 'cause i because i had to take off to go in for surgery 

194.27 205.07 B: 'bout about two weeks after just before i had that i mean just two weeks after i got past i had bronchitis i used to like didn't go to the doctor with that since i had to take off work to uh go to the doctor for that 

204.60 205.58 A: for what 

205.36 211.87 B: (( for i had to go in for surgery for an hernia operation that i had that about i think it was three years ago but )) 

206.85 207.99 A: oh 

213.22 215.00 B: i know [laughter] 

213.25 215.44 A: yeah you'd have to go for that [laughter] 

215.50 222.40 B: so with the bronchitis like which i might have had i just like i said took over the counter stuff 

224.45 228.47 A: usually with me it'll take an antibiotic to get over bronchitis 

231.17 232.53 A: but do you smoke 

232.60 234.89 B: yeah i s- smoke too so 

234.31 236.04 A: yeah i do too so 

237.24 240.98 A: thought maybe you didn't maybe why you didn't have to go [laughter] 

240.63 247.95 B: so i didn't know if it was the cigarettes or if it was the or if it was um a cold that that's kind of in the past so 

252.18 255.69 A: are you healthy pretty healthy person then otherwise huh 

255.92 262.52 B: usually uh i haven't the last that was the last time i looked at a doctor in fact was for that operation about three years ago and 

263.11 264.81 A: well that's good 

264.10 269.56 B: i know i don't the the flu shot every fall either like i probably should because say i work in retail but 

270.70 272.24 A: you work in retail 

272.65 275.52 A: oh then you probably be round about sick people 

275.01 277.92 B: (( yeah )) 

278.00 281.46 B: (( a lot of times yeah )) 

280.85 284.40 A: well i hope that doesn't cris- disqualify us i just 

284.79 287.72 A: acid- disconnected my call waiting 

287.99 289.99 B: you you did did what 

289.42 291.06 A: do you have call waiting 

290.74 296.90 B: oh no i i'm just on a i'm on a a not a cellphone but uh remote phone 

296.91 298.06 A: oh 

296.95 299.31 B: antenna phone whatever you want to call it 

299.07 306.77 A: i disconnected my s- cell call my call waiting and they said they'll disqualify you if it beeps like that and mine just beeped 

306.64 308.01 B: oh sorry i don't know what's 

308.86 312.58 B: they said when eight minutes is up they're supposed to pop in on us so ten minutes whatever 

312.50 316.53 A: they will but i'm afraid that just ruined it for us i hope not 

317.38 322.09 A: because i disabled it before you know my time came up at ten o'clock 

325.02 327.56 A: so i shouldn't have even got that call [mn] 

329.13 335.43 B: well i didn't hear any beep so i guess wait a couple more like couple a minutes wait and see 

331.75 332.79 A: it must 

334.89 337.83 A: yes i don't want it to disqualify us 

339.83 343.87 A: i think this is really neat i just heard about it that you could do these surveys 

344.36 345.55 B: i um 

345.58 350.24 B: i got i heard about it through the actually through a freebee board on the internet it's 

350.01 352.59 A: oh i heard it from the internet too 

352.50 357.52 B: from um the one i was yes it's free dot com 

357.63 359.16 B: is where i saw it 

358.53 359.52 A: from where 

359.32 362.11 B: it's got just called it's called yes it's free 

361.61 362.81 A: oh 

362.16 364.29 B: (( y._i._l. )) 

367.19 368.92 A: and i heard about it um 

369.01 370.48 A: free for mom 

372.83 382.55 B: so i just called the number up because i take it from work i called them for any answer and i said yeah i have a answering machine and i noticed there were a couple of calls on it if you would have said hello i don't know 

384.86 390.56 B: about why it would have done that but think maybe i'm getting we're getting off the subject here i hope that doesn't ruin anything but 

390.91 395.19 B: but um uh but sometimes you get pretty strange messages on answering machines anyway 

396.81 400.22 A: oh i sure hope that that doesn't disqualify us 

402.61 404.31 A: that they won't take it 

405.62 407.10 A: we'll find out 

407.76 411.89 B: (( but eight minutes is a long time to talk about what the subject they gave too the )) 

412.44 413.33 A: pardon 

412.98 417.45 B: eight minutes is quite a while to talk about that the subject about going to the doctor and 

416.72 422.71 A: it does seem like a long time but i had one last night too and it was about food 

422.74 427.23 A: and it seemed like we ran out of things to talk about 

428.33 429.64 B: (( all [noise] i guess )) 

428.82 434.14 A: but this is a cold and flu season so it's probably why they would like us to discuss it 

433.95 436.74 B: well mine is more like um 

437.13 441.04 B: allergies right now i think than cold and flu but [noise] and 

441.38 443.27 A: i've been having those too 

444.35 446.69 A: my three daughters had strep throat 

446.99 447.80 A: too 

448.76 451.33 B: you didn't get it that's like that's pretty um 

449.58 450.43 A: no 

451.99 453.33 B: pretty catching i know 

452.95 454.64 A: very contagious 

456.15 458.20 A: so far i've been lucky 

460.03 462.07 A: and i've been around all three of them 

462.28 464.75 B: uh usually when i get a cold it's just in my 

464.80 470.82 B: like a sinus cold or in my gums where it's you don't know whether you've got a toothache or if you if you've got a cold 

471.24 473.11 A: (( oh yes )) 

473.20 476.75 B: and luckily so far it's just been a cold 

477.76 479.58 A: you haven't had a cold this year 

479.42 483.04 B: no not as far as i n- just a sinus type cold in my in my gums 

484.12 490.28 A: i started having a cold and i take zinc when i think i'm going to get a cold right away i take zinc 

491.10 492.90 A: and it seems to help 

495.27 505.02 B: recently i got some product to test sure that was through another type survey type thing probably to test for um for colds it's like a pre-cold thing that you 

505.09 508.83 B: like it's very helpful so that they're not and i think that helped too 

509.57 511.61 A: what was it 

510.25 521.15 B: [noise] it's like a like a s- a you don't have to talk too much about your survey stuff but um that was um uh like a pre- you you spray it like you're supposed to be like you take it if if you think you're coming down with a cold and you then you um use the nasal spray 

521.37 522.68 A: oh really 

522.52 526.63 B: and then even after the cold you're only supposed to still doing it for like a preventive thing 

527.60 529.61 A: oh i've never heard of it 

529.50 533.23 B: it was some kind of thing i did for a survey test 

534.35 538.39 A: well that is neat i'd like to try out something like that 

537.63 542.46 B: (( [noise] what yeah i )) 

541.14 543.34 A: i enjoy doing surveys too 

544.04 547.01 B: do quite a few of those on line

550.05 551.88 B: (( do )) 

551.24 554.21 A: this is the first one that i've had that was a phone one 

554.88 560.84 B: uh yeah this is one this is kind of different but then i've seen this through penn state so i figured it was legit yeah 

562.33 563.55 B: (( yeah )) 

562.37 564.44 A: it's easier than writing [laughter] 

564.17 567.45 B: (( that's does you u. penn you p- up you u. penn )) 

567.50 579.52 B: university of pennsylvania because i printed out the information off the when they sent me a email yeah 

576.94 577.68 A: (( mm )) 

579.03 585.99 A: i did mine over the internet i applied and everything and then they wrote back and said that i had been accepted 

585.41 586.64 B: that's what i did 

586.77 590.61 B: then i just printed off the stuff when i got the email 

592.22 595.04 B: it says up to three calls on here so it says so 

595.23 599.89 A: i was wondering about that do we really only get three calls is that three in a month
