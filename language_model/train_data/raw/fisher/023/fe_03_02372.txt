150.14 159.52 A: yeah i i i remember as a kid my mother always said you know if somebody picks up the phone and talks to you about somebody else you can be guaranteed that when they hang up their phone 

159.38 172.02 A: they're going to be on the phone talking to [laughter] about you [laughter] that's right you know and it's like something that i i think is very true you know i used to notice that even with my kids if they get on the phone to somebody and you know 

161.07 164.64 B: talking to somebody else [laughter] that's right 

171.99 179.57 A: start gossiping and before you know it you know it's like well you know that that story's going around and who knows how it's changed you know 

178.84 193.34 B: yeah well i remember ah a i'm a cosmetologist and i went to when i was in cosmetology school and people you know how they gossip and everything well the teacher started from on one end of the room and said something to someone 

188.03 189.01 A: right 

193.22 194.23 A: right 

193.56 198.39 B: and then by the time it had went through all the way around to the other side of the room 

198.41 202.66 B: oh ah it was totally different from what she had said 

200.41 204.21 A: yeah yeah that's li- like that game telephone 

204.41 206.52 A: you know do you ever play that 

206.30 207.19 B: no 

206.60 220.07 A: you know somebody makes a statement and then they have to whisper it to the next person and then the next and so on and so forth and like i said before you know it it gets down to the end and the story is like you're wondering you know where did they get that from 

219.48 227.49 B: yeah well that's like the teacher done that time th- that's just the way it was by the time it got to the other end of the class in this ah 

219.98 221.95 A: it's not even close 

227.66 231.86 B: it was totally different from what she had said to begin with so 

230.94 233.15 A: right that's yeah that's true

243.20 244.87 B: yeah i can't either 

243.71 250.63 A: um not working out you know all those things are health issues but i think something like gossip can really 

250.53 260.57 A: hurt other than you know just the person themselves i mean i think it can hurt a lot of people you know um without even knowing it like i said i i just got involved with something in 

253.42 254.55 B: right 

260.46 271.90 A: in the family and it turns out that somebody said something and it wasn't even true but before you know it you know my sister took it as the gospel truth and [noise] hello
