115.84 117.15 A: control 

117.48 119.41 A: you know the urge that they're just 

120.46 126.23 A: you know it that it it takes over their lives and and causes and causes 

126.31 128.93 A: problems and interferes with 

129.87 132.82 A: i guess day to day activities so that they can't

135.06 136.83 A: they might be able to 

136.62 141.67 B: well now it really interfere it used to not you used to be able to smoke anywhere 

141.63 147.71 A: i know well no but i'm i'm saying even interfere like somebody smokes and then they're smoking for 

148.49 159.58 A: let's just say twenty years and it doesn't bother them and it's you know it interferes with other people maybe but then all of a sudden they have some problem and they're coughing and then they're coughing up blood and they go to their doctor with it 

159.35 163.57 A: you know they're just their daughter just had their first grandchild and then they have lung cancer 

163.58 167.88 A: (( and it's like uh mm you know ooh why couldn't you quit )) 

167.89 172.76 A: so you know that's that's hard but then you're right also too that's 

173.00 177.02 A: also now an issue i i live 

177.18 182.97 A: in the next state over from new york city and they just totally banned smoking from 

183.28 185.50 A: bars and restaurants 

185.60 187.72 A: so you can't even smoke in a bar 

187.55 189.37 B: now that would be interesting 

189.10 192.38 A: it it is it has been a 

192.90 196.24 A: a um a big change they're actually 

196.47 199.74 A: um it's caused such a huge controversy there was a 

200.42 215.29 A: a um oh lord what do you call the the a bouncer this poor gentleman was just trying to maintain the law that you know there was no smoking in the bars and somebody was smoking and he was trying to get them to leave and they shot him and killed him 

215.08 216.76 B: [cough] oh no 

216.53 228.32 A: so there's a big case going on in new york city and that's that's because of smoking [laughter] somebody wouldn't somebody just wouldn't say like okay i can wait to smoke my cigarette he got so upset over the fact that 

228.65 231.47 A: this poor person who was just employed at 

231.59 236.80 A: you know who knows the poor thing probably made ten dollars [laughter] an hour and they killed him over it 

237.18 239.24 A: so that's uh 

239.79 241.09 A: definitely 

241.57 246.54 A: [laughter] it's definitely changed the situation so let's see 

245.62 251.19 B: awful i i can remember back when i did smoke you know [sigh] 

251.38 258.51 B: going to a bar and sitting and drinking was one of the one times that you really really really wanted a cigarette 

257.96 260.19 A: right i remember yeah 

258.66 265.24 B: or after you got finished eating the very first thing i always wanted was a cigarette 

264.60 265.65 A: right 

265.45 272.15 B: so you're mixing alcohol and no cigarettes [laughter] 

265.81 266.65 A: right 

270.58 273.46 A: uh it's it's very strange 

273.05 279.43 B: but yet at the same time the poor people that didn't smoke that were in bars might as well smoke 

279.07 280.09 A: right 

279.47 282.37 B: because my best friend did not smoke 

282.49 289.97 B: but she loved to go to bars to go have a couple of drinks and dance you know just normal 

290.59 291.97 A: everyday stuff 

291.33 296.16 B: yeah you know just go be a a a young adult 

295.64 296.81 A: right 

296.19 297.75 B: (( and )) 

298.14 302.78 B: she wasn't able to unless she took lots of allergy medicine 

302.57 309.56 A: [laughter] i i i like i say i that would happen to me sometimes when i'd be out 

309.80 320.79 A: and if it was a very smoky bar i would get really congested and then the next morning i'd wake up and my voice would be gone because you know just from breathing in all the smoke and not being used to it 

313.20 314.28 B: (( mhm )) 

316.90 317.94 B: mhm 

320.99 323.45 A: but it's it's funny i i remember 

323.46 332.53 A: my parents both smoked and they quit um years ago like so many people and um my dad used to say for for years he would still 

333.07 343.89 A: you know occasionally with certain things like if he saw somebody else pick up a cigarette he would get that craving you know in certain situations now he doesn't but it's um 

339.38 340.10 B: mhm 

344.21 347.53 A: you know it's it's changed it's definitely changed 

347.96 348.87 A: well 

349.21 357.20 A: so let's see there was what were the other things there was smoking there was excessive smoking excessive drinking not exercising what was the other thing 

357.48 358.93 A: overeating no 

357.59 358.41 B: um 

359.59 360.73 B: i don't know 

360.58 362.71 A: i don't remember well listen 

362.73 364.58 A: i think not exercising 

364.82 368.43 A: it's good for you but i think if you have to compare 

370.11 374.97 B: i don't think it it it affects other people like smoking and drinking does 

372.88 373.82 A: no 

374.57 383.15 A: no i don't i think i think smoking and drinking definitely impact more on other people's lives whether it's the family or friends 

380.64 382.16 B: yeah choosing 

382.52 386.94 B: choosing not to exercise is just you know harming your own body 

386.80 387.64 A: right 

387.81 389.80 A: and [laughter] and uh 

389.81 391.13 A: not affecting 

391.18 395.39 A: not affecting other people i agree [noise] i definitely agree 

395.82 398.44 B: i think there was also gossip 

397.98 400.54 A: oh i forgot about gossip that was the other one 

400.68 402.08 B: gossip 

402.17 403.50 A: (( gossip well )) 

402.85 405.20 B: compared to smoking and drinking 

405.04 406.12 A: hm 

405.84 407.62 B: that's kind of 

407.97 409.69 B: a weird comparison 

409.74 416.64 A: it is a weird comparison but gossip you know thinking about it i mean i know we all do it even though we're not supposed to but 

417.16 418.43 A: (( it's it's )) 

417.47 423.82 B: and if you compare it biblically you know it's just as bad as any of the rest 

424.24 426.15 A: right i'd probably agree 

426.76 429.01 B: but if you compare it 

429.28 433.03 B: socially everybody does it [laughter] 

430.79 431.62 A: or e- 

432.13 434.81 A: or im- impactfully i mean i think 

436.53 437.67 A: i think 

438.04 439.67 A: some of the ways that it might 

438.10 440.73 B: i think you can kill somebody with your tongue you 

440.24 440.96 A: (( hm )) 

440.92 442.93 B: can kill somebody with your tongue 

442.16 445.93 A: i was just gonna say like you know have you ever accidentally been 

446.05 455.52 A: saying something about somebody and then that person overheard or found out and then you felt so terrible in your heart you were thinking that oh my goodness you know you weren't thinking when you were saying something 

455.76 456.79 A: and you weren't 

457.29 463.28 A: you weren't realizing the impact that it possibly could have on their feelings 

464.01 465.19 A: and that's 

465.83 469.08 A: you know i think that's something that but i don't think 

469.25 470.58 A: i don't think that 

471.72 473.14 A: (( that could [noise] affect )) 

473.28 474.62 A: so much 

474.78 476.44 A: the um 

477.43 480.19 A: the impact that smoking or drinking could 

481.96 483.07 B: no 

483.55 485.87 A: i i think smoking or drinking you know 

486.11 491.76 A: the the pain and suffering that it could be causing family members like if 

491.78 496.94 A: let's say you have a spouse that was and you smoke and the smoke causes them to get lung cancer 

496.70 497.74 B: mhm 

497.12 504.10 A: or it causes them to have breathing problems [noise] or they're so worried about you 

504.33 505.79 A: because you're 

505.83 510.66 A: you know constantly coughing and you can't walk up the stairs and um 

511.19 512.46 A: all these other 

512.59 514.51 A: health 

514.93 519.74 A: these things that impact your health and they're so worried over that that's affecting them 

520.09 524.14 A: so yeah i definite- and then drinking the same thing i mean 

524.72 526.94 A: good gosh those people that just um 

528.59 531.92 A: ruin their lives with with you know drinking 

532.03 533.53 A: and um 

534.32 537.36 A: you know cause so much pain to their family i mean 

537.42 538.70 A: one of my 

538.75 542.07 A: um one of my friends her brother her parents have spent 

542.33 545.54 A: so much money trying to put him in um 

546.72 551.31 A: um detox programs you know for for drinking and he just 

552.21 553.27 A: can't stop 

553.46 556.83 A: and um you know it's been going on and on for years 

557.67 560.99 A: and that's so painful to them i mean they're older 

561.09 562.72 A: and um 

562.86 565.60 A: you know you think oh they shouldn't be going through that 

565.98 567.04 A: so 

567.83 569.87 A: definitely think that uh 

570.99 572.33 A: that's an issue 

573.82 575.48 A: and compared to gossip 

576.56 577.38 A: i 

577.40 579.47 A: i i don't think there's any comparison [noise] 

579.71 583.72 A: and the overeating or the um sorry not exercising 

583.42 584.48 B: right 

586.00 588.11 A: you any additional thoughts 

588.26 590.27 B: not that i can think of 

591.93 597.34 B: i just i i can't imagine putting the two of 'em side by side and trying to compare 'em 

597.58 599.59 A: all right no i think i think it's
