162.84 170.88 A: when people gossip and stuff and and i know this from first hand just because my sister and my mother have been through many sev- several jobs and 

169.73 170.63 B: yeah 

171.12 179.51 A: that's what they have to do deal with it's just like everybody gossiping and my mum's come home crying and anxious she's had to go to the hospital with chest pain 

176.12 177.04 B: (( mm )) 

179.15 180.19 B: yeah 

179.65 186.30 A: because everybody you know it's just like all the gossiping and stuff that goes on in an office it really puts a lot of stress on people 

183.92 184.88 B: yeah 

186.09 187.45 B: yeah 

186.80 194.76 A: so and i guess it just depends on how you handle it and everybody's different on how they handle stuff i tend to let it go in where one ear and out the other but

336.61 337.50 A: (( oh )) 

337.82 347.36 A: [laughter] no but those really smoking is probably the only thing that really as far as other people's personal habits but 

345.87 358.44 B: [sigh] yeah yeah 'cause it really does invade you i went to a a a club um last night and i know the and and we recently outlawed smoking in clubs i'm from new york um by the way 

357.66 361.21 A: i was gonna say boston or new york after i heard you talk 

359.16 360.11 B: (( uh-huh )) 

360.78 375.34 B: uh-huh yeah i'm from brooklyn i'm ra- born and raised in brooklyn new york and um that's where i live now and uh but i was in a club in manhattan last night and there's no smoking allowed any more in clubs and most places in in manhatten and new york uh 

375.26 387.78 B: city and uh it's a whole different experience i mean you come home and you take off your clothes and you know like you bring your shirt over your head to take it off and it doesn't smell from smoke any more it's a whole it's a whole new thing and it's 

383.78 385.60 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

386.73 388.58 A: but do you think i mean 

388.93 393.58 A: because they've made that law has it decreased the amount of people that go to the clubs 

393.91 399.27 B: it's it's brand new this law about bars and clubs it's 

396.63 397.95 A: oh 

398.18 401.68 A: is it because of the fires and things that they've had in the past or 

400.03 404.98 B: no it's it's um it's an air it's a health issue it's yeah and it's um 

402.81 403.93 A: (( oh okay )) 

405.07 412.04 B: you know new york has not had those major fires uh in clubs like some other cities 

411.39 412.50 A: cities have 

412.12 417.51 B: 'cause we've got this incredibly strong um fire code like you know the 

417.61 420.56 B: the one of the harshest in the nation and um 

420.81 431.06 B: but yeah this one's a health issue the the mayor is p- is particul- is a rabid anti smoke person and um and so they he helped initiate some of these laws 

426.79 427.80 A: okay 

431.31 444.31 B: um but yeah some of the people are complaining that uh the first week or s- literally it's in the bar- in the bars and clubs it's only like three weeks old so three weeks ago they were talking you know some of the people on t._v. and stuff were talking about 

431.39 431.97 A: (( uh-huh )) 

439.72 440.84 A: oh 

444.09 453.45 B: you know the bars are clo- they're quiet their bars are empty and about three weeks ago i went to one and it was kinda quiet and my friend said gee it's usually not this quiet on a monday night but it was only a monday night too 

452.61 453.58 A: mhm 

453.45 460.62 B: so uh but i think people i think people that are go to bars they'll still go to bars you know they'll 

459.08 460.30 A: yeah 

461.18 462.05 B: (( they'll )) 

462.13 465.38 B: settle into their older habits you know um 

463.61 464.76 A: mhm 

465.45 472.86 B: and what's wor- i guess smoking is the worst for that it'll be in a couple of a months it'll be ten years since i smoked 

472.49 473.75 A: oh that's good 

472.89 476.87 B: a cigarette yeah so that's a good thing yeah 

475.13 477.32 A: yeah you imagine [laughter] 

477.50 481.97 A: all these people i see that smoke for years come in the hospital and they can't breathe any more and [laughter] 

482.31 483.56 B: yeah 

482.46 487.52 A: it's you know you're like well [laughter] of course they didn't know back then that all the dangers 

486.12 494.20 B: well yeah i think uh i think your that your your job is to not be repulsed and not be um 

494.13 499.80 B: not be uh you know pointing fingers but just to help what you can and to you know 

498.10 499.22 A: yeah 

499.74 513.12 B: you know i mean honestly the the idea that y- you know you wanna throw up because somebody is overeating on some- it's sort of it's a little too judgemental for me i you know try to look away and if it bothers you try to realize that it's not your life 

504.64 505.64 A: [laughter] 

512.52 513.90 A: no no 

512.97 515.60 B: is the way that i i feel you know it is 

514.68 515.76 A: yeah 

515.87 523.94 B: you know people ha- have the right to be respected for whatever the hell they do you know they wanna eat a dozen a dozen things well 

520.08 521.37 A: oh sure 

523.44 526.97 A: they have to be accountable for that i mean you know what i mean it's their own 

527.33 530.29 A: but yesterday it just drive me nuts for some reason [laughter] 

529.92 531.02 B: yeah 

530.39 534.72 A: you know females they're in a mood that day and it just carries on [laughter] 

533.93 535.23 B: well did you 

535.24 539.27 B: how come a- how come of all these people only three people ate doughnuts 

538.74 553.66 A: well i didn't feel good and i didn't really feel like eating and then the other girl you know of course we're all skinny bitches so there you go [laughter] [laughter] so they only had three le- left and it was obviously but yeah no um 

543.62 548.93 B: yeah skinny bitches yeah you're really hungry like a mother like a mother and uh 

549.95 551.05 B: yeah 

553.78 560.88 B: i like i like the idea of people consuming what they wanna consume they go for it enjoy yourself that's excessive though 

553.84 555.21 A: but maybe 

559.07 567.75 A: well you know and maybe maybe it wasn't so much the excessive eating either maybe i guess maybe it was actually their personal like the way their mannerisms like how they ate 

567.42 569.62 B: oh right yeah 

567.77 573.61 A: was you know in front of people they're eating like pigs and then they got icing all over their mouth and 

571.30 572.47 B: [laughter] and 

573.27 575.27 B: (( then them [mn] [laughter] )) 

574.27 580.42 A: [laughter] so maybe it's not so much the excessive eating bo- that bothered me it was just their manners but 

578.66 579.91 B: yeah 

580.09 581.54 B: yeah 

580.89 581.72 A: so 

581.77 586.02 B: yeah you know it's it's an interesting thing though in this in this world that 

585.95 599.89 B: you know in so far as like sexual attraction there's people that love heavy people and there's people that love skinny people and and you know it's beau- and you know blacks and whites and you know it it w- w- what one person 

593.34 594.38 A: uh-huh
