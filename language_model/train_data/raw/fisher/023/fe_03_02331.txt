118.96 120.39 A: i'm on it 

119.83 121.21 B: oh does it help 

121.24 123.74 A: well a little bit [laughter] 

123.12 126.07 B: takes a while to get maybe into your system 

126.15 128.89 A: [mn] i've been on it for two years so 

128.36 129.86 B: oh wow [laughter] 

129.23 131.70 A: [laughter] it's well into my system 

130.82 134.03 B: (( guess you've been on it long enough um )) 

133.02 134.89 A: yeah 

134.05 146.99 B: i have i don't know what if it's allergies or what but when the seasons change um i get the migraine headaches very bad when the barometer changes um do you ever get those

150.93 151.87 A: yeah 

151.56 157.39 B: um i think that i've never been diagnosed or tested but i think that's allergies but i don't 

156.45 162.40 A: [mn] but i think that would that would affect your cold a lot more it would make the duration longer 

161.79 164.52 B: [noise] i would think so more miserable too 

165.01 173.10 B: you know getting all clogged up and personally i think i'd rather have a even though they're they're m- they're a pain i'd rather have a head cold than a chest cold 

165.03 166.22 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

173.00 174.35 A: yeah 

173.64 176.06 B: i can't seem to get rid of chest colds 

176.01 177.19 A: no 

176.57 180.42 B: no matter what and head colds at least you can try to take something for it 

180.43 192.03 B: but um i have a um thyroid problem underactive thyroid so you have to be very careful on what you take otherwise for some reason it can interact any sort of medication 

191.98 198.27 B: um especially over the counter could interact to make your heart rate go really really fast like deadly fast 

198.26 199.40 A: (( okay really )) 

198.57 206.98 B: um so that's why they put a warning on the back about thyroid you know if you have thyroid problems not to take most over the counter medications or even cough medicines 

206.18 211.91 A: [mn] 'specially that like acetaminophen i can't take that that'll make my heart just go 

210.16 213.19 B: (( really like tylenol and all that )) 

212.57 215.41 A: anything with acetaminophen i can't take 

214.88 217.28 B: oh wow what happens 

216.48 218.53 A: it stuffs me up and 

218.23 219.67 B: no kidding 

218.90 221.07 A: my heart just races yeah 

220.46 223.14 B: well i wouldn't i'd stay away from it then 

223.01 224.25 A: mhm 

223.59 225.88 B: (( what do you take like ibuprofen )) 

226.27 227.12 A: (( [noise] yeah ))

229.47 231.95 B: isn't that the same thing as ibuprofen or no 

232.63 233.87 A: (( i'm not sure )) 

234.07 245.51 B: you know i know com- ibuprofen comes under a thousand different names like tylenol does too which is all acetaminophen but i may be wrong it may be a different class of medications um 

238.98 239.92 A: yeah 

245.67 259.30 B: usually if i have to go to the doctor for a cold i usually end up on um i end up on antibiotics and and um like prescription cough medicine which i don't like to take because i don't like i don't like to feel drugged [mn] 

259.30 263.51 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] no no and that stays with you until the next day 

262.97 265.44 B: oh i know it's like a drug [noise] hangover 

265.26 266.91 A: yeah yep 

265.80 276.27 B: and there's you know you can't function you can't think [noise] you you know [noise] it's hard to drive even and i so i just won't take it the antibiotics i will um 

273.73 274.58 A: yeah 

276.33 283.38 B: but they don't like to give those out too much anymore anyway unless they're sure that that it's like bacterial and not viral 

283.38 291.96 A: see and a lot of times more often now they'll be like oh it's viral it has to run its course so i'll wait till the fourth day or third day 

283.48 284.37 B: because [noise] 

291.52 292.92 B: [laughter] 

292.18 293.10 A: to go in 

293.26 294.21 B: yeah

296.41 304.32 B: yeah absolutely well the last time i got super super bad um [noise] well actually second to the last time i went into 

304.21 318.75 B: [noise] like a urgent care centre and they did x-rays and all that type of stuff and they said oh you have a you know a cold which duh no kidding i mean i was miserable [noise] i was truly truly miserable and this was going on like a week and a half now 

318.73 327.74 B: and they said but you know you'll be fine and all that and just no we're not going to give you anti- any antibiotics and this is on a sunday morning and on tuesday 

327.64 336.29 B: the man who wrote the radiologist who reread the x-ray said you need to get into your doctor now you have triple pneumonia both lungs and your bronchials 

335.76 337.34 A: (( oh my god ))

350.04 350.88 A: (( mm )) 

350.05 357.03 B: [noise] and then they had then then they had the nerve to charge me for the visit [laughter] after they they misdiagnosed me i mean that could have killed me 

356.86 358.89 A: yes very easily 

357.46 358.35 B: so 

358.59 367.30 B: [laughter] but the last time i had pneumonia um it was very strange because we went to mexico um i won a a free trip from w._r._o._l. 

367.30 379.97 B: and uh my husband and i went to mexico for five days and came back and i had a like a bad chest cold and i thought it was just like bronchitis and i went to the doctor and we went through two courses of augmentin and it didn't do anything 

380.06 393.84 B: and um so the c._d._c. center for disease control got involved and it turned out i had malaria now i didn't i thought first of all i thought malaria was eradicated and i did never knew that a m- malaria can turn into 

394.11 396.36 B: like something like a chest cold 

396.53 397.44 A: (( uh-huh oh my g- )) 

396.69 408.22 B: and um what it actually is some sort of worm and it lives it lives with you forever you don't ever get rid of it but the c._d._c. got involved and i got better they gave me then three days of flagel and i was fine 

408.30 413.18 B: but i went on for like [mn] god about twenty days on on the augmentin 

413.31 415.99 B: um and it still didn't do anything 

415.69 417.67 A: what part of mexico 

417.65 418.83 B: cancun 

419.03 422.88 A: see we were in mazatlan and that happened to my boyfriend 

422.61 424.24 B: did he get malaria too oh 

423.77 426.52 A: same god dang thing yeah 

425.93 428.18 B: now see i hear it's so rare 

428.14 430.29 A: well he had it too 

430.18 431.44 B: (( wow )) 

430.87 433.14 A: (( he was sicker than a dog )) 

432.63 444.00 B: yeah and it seems it seems like it like it starts out just like a cold um you know and i thought maybe it was the airplane or the change because we went it was last year april first remember that big that huge big snowstorm last year 

435.82 436.94 A: mhm 

444.04 457.13 B: uh there was a big blizzard and we left that day and got there it was eighty six degrees so i thought the change in the weather and then going back [mn] from the hot into the cold um did it but it it wasn't it wasn't that at all 

453.46 454.40 A: mhm 

457.71 460.12 B: very strange [laughter] 

459.70 460.43 A: (( hm )) 

460.29 462.01 B: so what did they do for him 

462.51 468.31 A: pretty much the same thing put him onto antibiotics they weren't you know i'm kind of in a little hick town 

465.40 465.96 B: (( [mn] )) 

468.02 469.00 B: yeah 

468.41 473.61 A: they don't get so upset about things like that as they would up there they're better doctors 

472.68 481.47 B: well see they have to well yeah but this doctor that i went to wasn't so good i went back to my old doctor the c._d._c. guy because this guy was just giving me the same thing over and over 

481.48 482.71 B: but um 

482.76 489.32 B: you know he got it right away he knew he says he said it's either strangulitis or it's malaria and they did tests and it was malaria 

489.12 502.38 B: and i understand if you got it while you were in the united states for some reason it has to be reported as a big you know big news thing you know the news cameras come out but if you get it while you're out of the country like in mexico or something like that 

502.30 506.72 B: they they don't they don't count it i can't explain this they don't 

506.99 518.05 B: it's it's not as bad there's no news coverage but if there's an outbreak or even one person gets it when you're in country like if you were to get it from in your back yard then they have to quarantine you and everything else 

515.35 516.26 A: mhm 

518.15 519.09 A: (( oh my )) 

518.28 525.60 B: now with him and the way i was too i bet if it came around again they would think we had that sars stuff 

525.44 528.61 A: yeah pr- probably nowadays yeah 

526.09 526.91 B: (( you know )) 

527.68 536.10 B: but i mean it's the exact same symptoms at least i had i mean extremely high fever i was like a hundred and four hundred and four to a hundred and five 

536.05 539.01 B: bad bad chest you know congestion 

538.90 552.08 B: um the nose all stuffed up uh i felt like i was on some sort of an acid trip i mean i couldn't stand up i couldn't get out i was so cold and shivering i went in the tub to try to warm up i couldn't get out of the tub i was so weak 

544.16 545.15 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

552.41 556.52 B: and didn't even realise it and my husband had to come and lift me out of the tub 

552.44 553.66 A: wow 

556.72 559.94 B: (( and then i would keep climbing back in because i was so cold [laughter] )) 

559.33 560.50 A: (( [laughter] )) 

560.11 567.29 B: but um you know i don't know i don't know what that has to do [noise] really with a cold [mn] but it was cold like symptoms

579.77 588.15 B: i suppose with me personally um if the cold was just a like uh like if it kept getting worse i would go probably day five or six 

588.23 593.13 B: um if it wasn't getting any better or if it was getting worse what [noise] about you 

592.94 596.02 A: i'd go day three i think like i said 

595.79 596.70 B: yeah 

596.08 599.89 A: [noise] there's a lot of things around here and the first time they said that i thought they were just
