17.33 19.82 A: i don't know which one do you think is worse 

19.85 21.24 B: um 

21.38 25.17 B: actually i think pretty much smoking is the worst one 

25.05 29.01 A: i smoke so and i don't drink so i think drinking is the worst so 

28.96 30.18 B: [laughter] 

29.26 30.56 A: [laughter]

51.33 52.11 A: so 

51.55 58.01 B: don't you think it depends on how much somebody drinks like if somebody let's say only has a beer like twice a week 

57.49 58.95 A: yeah 

58.34 60.05 B: well do you think that's bad too 

60.28 69.58 A: ah no no see my problem is i my husband drinks too much so i see a stupid side of him then when i used to drink i drank too much so that's why i don't drink any more 

69.20 70.44 B: oh okay 

70.09 73.66 A: that's why you know i'd like to have a beer but you don't know when to stop so [laughter] 

73.61 74.95 B: right right 

74.29 79.00 A: that's why my mind is set against that way and that's why i don't drink any more so

105.88 118.54 B: my [laughter] my doctor told me that i don't know it's it's also not good because there's something in the coffee that that's kind of bad for your skin [laughter] so i switched over to soy milk and i really miss my coffee

226.90 230.84 A: it's not too bad when you actually like it but for me to go to a gym 

230.33 232.95 B: [laughter] yes i felt the same because 

232.14 236.65 A: it's like a big yeah make myself go i can't do that [laughter] 

235.69 237.10 B: yeah i know 

237.32 246.58 B: that's the same thing because before i was doing ballet and i wanted to just exercise for the sake of exercise i couldn't do it i hated it it was so boring 

246.12 247.67 A: mhm 

247.13 249.25 B: that's probably how you feel right 

248.77 256.71 A: yeah i always thought about maybe i'll go out and run a little bit yeah yeah right [laughter] and then i went no i don't think so too cold out [laughter] 

252.18 253.35 B: uh-huh 

256.09 258.35 B: oh yeah yeah it's probably cold 

256.80 259.50 A: it's too hot i always have a reason why 

259.61 261.17 B: oh [laughter] 

261.95 267.98 A: i actually bought the tai bo tapes too but i gave them to my daughter i didn't even try it once so 

261.99 262.94 B: so 

268.74 271.28 B: wh- what did you say what were you trying 

270.23 272.48 A: those tai bo tapes that they have out 

272.27 273.24 B: uh-huh 

272.93 274.92 A: i actually bought a set of them 

274.58 276.00 B: oh 

275.63 280.44 A: i think there was five in the set and never i never even watched them i gave them to my daughter 

280.32 281.91 B: [laughter] 

281.22 284.07 A: she got use out of them but i i never even seen 

284.56 286.45 A: five minutes of it so 

286.88 295.41 B: so is what would you say is like the um main personal habit you have y- you would like to work on or give it up is there any of them 

294.76 297.38 A: ah smoking definitely 

296.75 297.81 B: smoking 

297.43 301.30 A: yeah because i've been smoking since i was twelve years old 

301.25 301.86 B: (( argh )) 

301.32 303.15 A: and i'm thirty four i 

303.15 305.50 B: (( oh that's a long time [laughter] )) 

303.42 304.52 A: (( know )) 

305.42 313.22 A: you start out when you're a little kid and then you just keep the habit and now you can't kick it and you try to slow down and you just can't 

313.46 316.08 A: i think the more you watch what you're smoking 

316.90 318.36 A: the more you're smoking 

318.58 319.95 B: you think so 

319.15 321.21 A: (( yeah )) 

320.26 326.13 B: because i started smoking early when i was thirteen and i stopped it when i was eighteen 

325.79 327.90 A: really how did you do it 

326.50 327.82 B: yeah and it was 

328.09 338.06 B: um i started like i was smoking like anywhere some- sometimes i was only smoking like two or three cigarettes a day but there were times wh- where i would smoke a pack 

337.44 338.82 A: mhm 

338.27 340.61 B: and um i started coughing 

340.44 341.60 A: mhm 

340.98 353.60 B: and it wouldn't go away it wasn't a cold so i was like no i have to stop and i just all of a sudden i um totally stopped and now i have a cigarette like i don't know once a week or so when i go out or something 

353.18 354.55 A: mhm 

353.86 355.36 B: but that's it 

355.58 357.15 B: i just stopped al- 

355.91 358.68 A: i wish i could do that [laughter] 

357.87 367.23 B: yeah i was really surprised because most people say they have really a problem getting out of the habit and they have you know they try all kinds of stuff but for me i just quit 

367.53 377.36 A: yeah i was i tried one of those pills but i got sick from it but i don't think it worked so i was going to try the patch but they said that if you even like sneak even 

371.23 372.30 B: oh 

377.46 384.46 A: a drag from it when you're on the patch you get really sick because that's like well that's scaring me because i don't know if i c- could actually stay 

384.70 390.05 A: (( away i don't want to end up in hospital so that's right there [laughter] )) 

387.82 389.60 B: yeah 

390.43 395.55 B: and um wa- was what was the other one was it food or something 

394.36 395.07 A: (( i )) 

395.43 399.12 A: th- i just can't remember that i don't think it was dieting 

399.07 406.08 B: no i don't think it was either then what about caffeine 'cause um it's not only coffee what about coke do you drink coke 

399.71 400.82 A: no 

406.60 408.84 A: every now and then 

408.21 409.69 B: so occasionally 

409.22 412.57 A: yeah i just drink water usually 

412.54 414.22 B: yeah that's good though 

414.81 421.36 A: i don't like to have soda in my house because of my two kids the little one she's any kind of sugar makes her crazy 

421.36 422.47 B: oh yeah 

421.96 425.20 A: yeah so she likes water too actually so 

425.00 431.95 B: mhm th- that's good though because i had a hard time liking water and i kind of like forced myself to drink it 

426.69 427.53 A: yeah 

431.47 432.63 A: yeah 

432.01 437.09 B: but i actually like you know diet sprite or diet coke i just like it better 

437.36 440.35 B: but water is definitely better for you 

440.24 452.45 A: yeah actually if i have if i have a coke i have to have it with caffeine in it because i figure well the reason i'm drinking it is trying to get a kick because like i said i don't like i don't like coffee in the afternoon it's only in the morning so if i 

447.79 449.07 B: (( really )) 

452.43 458.42 A: if i need a pick-me-up it has to have caffeine in it so usually that's about the only time i drink soda 

455.62 456.70 B: oh 

458.85 459.94 B: okay 

459.46 461.07 A: yeah 

460.82 462.94 B: (( and um )) 

462.53 466.70 A: (( i i don't i can't remember for the life of me what the other one was )) 

467.61 469.10 A: smoking drinking 

469.17 470.38 A: (( yeah )) 

469.87 473.98 B: let's let's go back to the alcohol then whoops i dropped the phone are you

475.91 477.22 B: (( still there [laughter] )) 

477.59 483.36 B: [laughter] see i just noticed when i um sometimes when i was drinking alcohol 

483.89 486.15 B: like actually there was times when i was drinking 

486.65 488.15 B: (( are you there are you okay )) 

488.26 491.57 B: i'm just going to keep talking for the you know for the machine so 

488.35 490.40 A: a little kid jumping on my back okay 

491.86 496.61 B: um there was times when i would drink like three times a week or something 

496.28 497.49 A: mhm 

496.87 500.79 B: and i would have like two or three drinks but i just felt [noise] hello 

500.58 501.64 A: (( yeah )) 

501.05 502.98 B: yeah i just felt that um 

502.99 510.81 B: my energy the next day was like lacking like i would sleep like ten hours instead of seven and i'd f- feel a little tired 

510.17 511.66 A: yeah 

511.28 513.04 B: (( so i just sort of )) 

513.08 514.47 B: let go of it 

514.69 517.55 A: the drinking yeah so so did i after 

517.57 519.34 A: just if i go out 

519.65 523.48 A: the next day i would feel so horrible i couldn't even do anything 

523.27 525.35 B: oh yeah it was that bad 

524.81 531.26 A: well you couldn't function i know when i drank i smoked more even it was oh my god i can't even breath and 

531.47 532.76 B: yeah 

532.04 533.42 A: yeah so 

534.71 538.28 A: you just couldn't wake up the next day after you drank 

537.83 543.09 B: yeah i notice that too that it it just took away from you know the next day too 

542.73 543.82 A: mhm 

543.22 549.96 B: and then i was like no i need to and then my friend told me that um it just makes you um age faster 

550.00 552.70 A: (( yeah i heard that too yeah i heard that too )) 

551.53 558.78 B: yeah that's what she said too an- that you know it would like not necessarily and so i was like no i don't want to 

558.70 559.68 A: yeah 

559.06 567.93 B: you know but i still have a like a crave for it i like still sometimes when i go out i feel like i want to have a drink so i still like it 

567.51 568.32 A: yeah 

568.05 569.70 B: but i just don't you know 

569.46 583.48 A: i don't think it's too bad if you can do it in moderation but i just [laughter] i i never actually once i started having a drink i'd keep going and keep going and then i'd be drunk and it's like oh [laughter] but one day i just 

572.03 573.36 B: yeah yeah 

580.96 581.93 B: uh-huh 

584.14 588.80 A: just stopped drinking that apparently is hard to do but i got to smoking hard though 

589.83 593.08 B: yeah i think smoking is harder to do than drinking 

592.52 595.03 A: [laughter] 

593.27 599.89 B: but see drinking if if you i mean smoking is is is only long term dangerous for your body but it's not
