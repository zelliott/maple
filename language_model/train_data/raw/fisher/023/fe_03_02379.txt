105.54 106.92 A: but w- 

107.48 115.78 A: i mean just restaurants in general like if we you know all go out to eat as a family you know i don't want to have to inhale someone's smoke while i'm eating 

115.70 117.72 B: i know i find it disgusting 

117.50 123.32 A: i can i can really i truly appreciate that law that was passed you know 

124.68 134.02 A: not permitting people to smoke in public places because you know whether people tend to believe it or not second hand smoke is the most dangerous you know 

133.99 148.44 B: it's dangerous it's very dangerous and it's also just i just find it just really unpleasant if you're going out to spend money on a on a nice dinner or something like that it's just ah it's just s- something really it seems very intrusive to to do that to somebody else 

148.84 153.98 B: smoke near somebody else and i don't i i since i've never smoked myself have you ever smoked at all 

154.21 161.85 A: no well see when i was about eleven years old i tried it once and never again in my life you know 

158.17 159.02 B: okay

165.12 165.99 B: right 

169.15 170.10 B: sure 

173.33 187.94 A: ah you know i never really liked cigarette smoke but i just wanted to see you know why every body was doing it and i i didn't like it you know i was choking for you know minutes afterwards and you know y- you ever notice when you kiss a person that has smoked it's like licking an ashtray 

181.80 182.99 B: yeah 

186.50 187.15 B: (( argh )) 

187.86 193.77 B: sure i know i've never i um fort- i i dated i dated one person who um 

194.32 197.56 B: i only dated one person ever who smoked and she um 

197.34 209.26 B: she she tried to keep it from me not that i'm a judge i really i i have nothing against people who smoke in general if they want to smoke in their own homes or in their own cars or whatever i really don't have a problem with it but she she tried to keep it from me and 

206.84 207.86 A: uh-huh 

209.11 214.00 B: ah it was but you know it's impossible because everything does smell like smoke eventually you 

213.87 219.45 A: exactly yeah and ah case in point i used to work at th- this was like about in nineteen ninety i used to work at tom 

214.11 215.70 B: get around to it 

219.44 232.06 A: (( thumb it's a really upscale grocery store in d- in dallas texas they've got a smoking break room and a non smoking break room right th- they're painted exactly the same except when you go in the smoking break room where you can smoke the walls )) 

226.06 227.05 B: okay 

228.08 228.98 B: okay 

231.92 232.89 B: okay 

232.62 241.52 A: (( are yellow from the cigarette smoking yeah you know i couldn't believe it you know how the it's just that i mean it it's crazy you know people want to smoke and you know what it does to your lungs i've [cough] y- y- yeah )) 

239.83 241.52 B: really wow 

241.74 244.27 A: (( neither are we right certain certain things to me like um )) 

244.29 252.16 A: (( drinking and smoking it's amazing are that they are that they are actually legal when )) 

248.48 250.48 B: it's pretty amazing yeah 

252.92 255.06 A: (( all the health hazards plus you know )) 

256.65 262.64 B: yeah it's amazing that it's legal actually in a way i mean really what it comes down to and i guess i guess c- certain things 

257.01 258.02 A: (( public )) 

262.98 266.65 B: i'm not really a a drinker either but ah you know 

265.40 267.18 A: (( safety hazard as well )) 

266.94 275.27 B: i do have um i do have friends and i'll have like an occasional glass of wine or something like that but i've i've never been quote unquote drunk or anything like 

275.25 277.08 A: right 

280.75 282.07 B: (( that but )) 

284.60 287.02 B: (( i )) 

287.60 292.43 B: guess they're legal probably pretty much because there's a lot of money in 'em sure that's why they're legal 

291.84 294.38 A: exactly exactly 

292.70 295.37 B: but then some other things like um 

296.27 302.94 B: marijuana smoking which is just as dangerous as as alcohol in a lot of ways is is completely illegal [mn] 

302.27 304.24 A: mhm 

303.04 308.49 B: which is kind of frustrating um it it it g- it seems seems a bit hypocritical 

308.24 310.78 A: right very i mean i just 

310.79 315.28 A: it it's crazy you know how you know they can allow people to do this 

315.77 326.06 A: you know if if alcohol was you know if it was illegal you know we wouldn't have people killing people with their vehicles driving drunk you know 

315.97 317.13 B: yeah 

324.64 325.61 B: yeah 

325.96 338.39 B: absolutely i was involved in a car accident i was hit by ah by a truck from a dr- a truck driver who was driving drunk and lucky to even make it out you know i had sixteen stitches in my head and the whole nine yards 

337.28 339.90 A: oh man that was a blessing 

339.67 352.25 B: yeah very much a blessing that i made it through i thought you know incredible it's so therefore that's why i think that's one of the reasons since that happened when i was six seventeen i never really tend to i never decided i would drink at all i 

352.31 357.43 B: i've never had a drink in a bar even though i um i travel around for a living 

357.68 364.33 B: and um but you know i j- i i told myself i would never drink and get even one drink and get behind the wheel of a car 

357.73 358.51 A: (( mm )) 

364.75 365.64 A: uh-huh 

364.92 370.38 B: which is just ah it's just incredible to me that you know that that that's 

370.41 372.74 B: even allowed in this day and age 

372.96 378.46 A: yeah i know it's it's it's really crazy then what do you think about you know peop- 

379.93 381.41 A: oh are you there 

381.16 382.43 B: i'm here yes 

381.87 386.27 A: oh okay [laughter] i thought the phone hung up or something um 

385.16 385.86 B: no 

386.98 394.95 A: ah what do you think about people and you know their you know habits i see some really disgusting habits on the freeway 

395.30 396.71 B: oh yeah 

396.05 401.48 A: particularly people with very nice vehicles i catch them picking picking their nose 

401.77 402.94 B: [laughter] 

402.44 404.97 A: [laughter] you ever seen that 

404.39 413.20 B: sure sure i know i don't i don't get that it's just people feel like they're i think they feel like they're by themselves in there in their cars you know 

405.02 406.37 A: [laughter] 

412.94 414.76 A: e- exactly 

414.03 417.16 B: not realizing that everybody can see everything that they're doing 

416.59 419.54 A: exactly [laughter] 

417.93 419.76 B: when they surround them i know 

419.55 421.06 A: right right 

420.23 421.37 B: and um 

421.49 430.74 B: and cell phones are another thing th- they should i mean that's something that i'm talking on right now as we drive but i'm talking on like ah in a in a in a headset type thing 

430.04 433.69 A: a headset great yeah that's the safest way to do it 

433.11 443.33 B: yeah which is actually a law in new york now too um so you have to wear use that when you talk on a head phone o- on a on a cell phone but that's i mean they cause more accidents than 

443.43 447.24 B: i mean it's very difficult if you're it can be very distracted like that 

446.74 452.87 A: right you know because you can get very emotional on the other line like say you're talking to this girlfriend that wants to break up with you 

450.32 451.15 B: sure 

452.62 453.48 B: yeah 

453.13 457.93 A: you know and you're flying down the highway at seventy miles an hour your eyes full of tears you know 

457.41 458.81 B: [laughter] 

458.45 461.43 A: [laughter] yeah that could be pretty dangerous 

461.04 464.18 B: that's a good point a good point i don't 

462.33 465.88 A: yeah i've seen it [cough] 

465.82 476.49 B: oh yeah i've seen people getting into um i i i've almost had it happen to me a couple of times when someone calls me and you're reaching for your phone and trying to get it together and you realize that you know you're not you're not paying attention it's 

476.38 478.58 A: exactly yeah yeah
