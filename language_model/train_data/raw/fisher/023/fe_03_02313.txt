56.38 57.40 A: right 

57.86 60.11 A: i didn't unfortunately no 

59.89 63.96 B: maybe maybe only one of us hears it and that's um 

63.99 68.37 B: part of this thing i don't know anyway 

67.51 71.64 A: oh oh yeah so what um how how do you feel what do you think um 

71.14 85.28 B: well you know i really hardly ever get sick um i'm very fortunate when i get sick i really get sick like i have my appendix out or something like that but colds and flu and stuff i just never seem to get them 

74.51 75.36 A: right 

78.48 79.57 A: (( oh right )) 

80.88 81.80 A: (( really )) 

82.96 84.10 A: right 

84.36 87.61 A: right same here me too um um 

86.47 88.39 B: yeah 

87.63 92.60 A: people how how they usually you know come down with a cold with the change of weather 

92.21 93.49 B: yes 

93.41 99.06 A: um but you know i thank god that you know that doesn't occur with my metabolism you know 

98.24 102.18 B: yeah i um people at work 

102.26 108.65 B: um envy me a little bit i think because i have so much sick leave piled up 

105.13 106.58 A: right right 

107.62 108.48 A: (( [laughter] )) 

108.69 111.64 B: and um but uh 

111.92 116.79 B: (( so yeah um how did )) 

115.11 115.79 A: that's 

115.87 116.71 A: good 

118.27 132.78 B: so's this is not really a topic that i don't really get sick i the last time i used a b- any amount of sick leave is when i had to have my appendix out so um just the usual typical things i don't seem to get 

128.80 129.70 A: right 

132.86 140.89 A: right right i mean i i agree i'm i'm exactly the same way so this is a very hard topic for both of us to discuss 

141.55 149.11 A: um but um you know a lot of people do unfortunately with the change of weather get get the illness you know get sick [noise] 

149.24 155.01 A: um and it's a variety of age groups you know from little kids you know to adults 

154.65 155.88 B: oh yes 

156.14 157.12 A: (( you know )) 

158.38 160.71 A: but um why did you have your appendix removed 

161.59 163.72 B: 'cause it burst [laughter] 

163.09 171.04 A: oh yeah yeah i was supposed to get operated to remove my spleen but uh i chose not to yeah 

164.29 165.43 B: yeah 

167.41 168.76 B: oh really 

169.89 174.85 B: that that's often because of a very serious accident or something 

173.57 180.41 A: um not at all um i was diagnosed from one day to the other with um low platelet counts 

180.34 181.24 B: really 

180.57 183.84 A: um i dunno if you're familiar with the platelets in your blood 

183.24 185.59 B: um more or less 

185.37 193.73 A: well yeah well the normal count for a human being is around two hundred and twenty five thousand um i was diagnosed with just one 

194.05 195.42 B: really 

194.79 204.96 A: yeah so to make a long story short i was just um you know i was [noise] i was you know told by my doctor that i needed to get my spleen removed 

205.40 206.83 A: and [noise] 

207.32 215.54 A: once i did that you know that my platelets you know maybe will go up you know so it was like fifty fifty 

215.46 216.64 B: huh 

216.23 218.57 A: and this was three years ago i mean i dunno 

218.43 221.10 B: and you decided not to do that 

220.49 226.25 A: decided not to do that yeah and my platelets fortunately wen- went up on their own 

226.07 228.46 B: mm did you um 

228.75 231.86 B: talk to another doctor for a second opinion 

230.44 234.68 A: actually yes that's what i did i actually did get a second opinion um 

234.15 237.53 B: and was that doctor's opinion different or 

237.06 248.63 A: um he you know put me on a few tests um he wanted to leave that as your last resort type of thing um and fortunately i just you know 

244.21 245.15 B: uh-huh 

249.80 252.96 A: honestly i just stopped going to the doctor you know 

252.93 256.69 B: well actually i was just wondering whether that's such a um 

257.19 258.18 B: um 

259.81 262.52 B: serious potential um 

262.86 270.97 B: the potential is seri- you know i don't know you know what i mean i guess maybe um that um if it turned out to not be 

265.76 266.67 A: yeah 

271.34 284.92 B: necessary it would certainly make me wonder if i'd want to continue going there of course you know medicine is a art as they say it's you know differences of opinion and experience of the doctor and each person is different and unique you know so 

278.23 279.31 A: (( absolutely )) 

284.13 285.64 A: right right 

284.80 287.27 B: sort of talking generically about 

287.42 291.62 B: health or something as see ea- each person has 

291.83 294.79 B: each person is different each doctor is different it's 

294.08 295.36 A: (( that's correct used )) 

294.81 297.59 B: sort of a miracle anyone's ever not sick i suppose 

297.79 299.69 B: [laughter] anyway 

298.42 303.10 A: to talk to people i used to talk to people from all over the world you know who had the same disease 

302.74 303.56 B: (( oh )) 

303.25 306.25 A: um there is no cure for it and um it 

307.03 315.69 A: fifty some people they go oh my god yeah i got so much better after i removed my spleen and half the people were like oh it was you know it was a mistake and this and this and that so 

316.08 319.32 B: hm is there a um 

316.96 318.13 A: very confusing 

319.33 325.84 B: typical reason why someone would have low platelets like that 

323.85 324.85 A: (( they )) 

325.52 329.62 A: they have no idea there is no proof really we 

327.56 328.44 B: really 

329.02 333.14 B: so they don't know if it's some sort of genetic thing that's kicked in later or 

332.60 334.67 A: do not know we do not 

333.72 335.31 B: (( um mm )) 

335.68 339.25 A: it's crazy i mean it happened to me one day to the next you know 

339.27 340.23 B: huh 

339.44 342.87 A: i don't know should we be discussing [laughter] this or 

342.28 351.66 B: [laughter] i don't know i guess we're sort of off topic but i'm i'm sort of um my my daughter who's in college was the one who told me about this thing and i 

345.19 346.22 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

349.29 350.15 A: right 

351.67 352.90 B: and uh 

353.04 356.78 B: she says every time you talk to somebody i get some money you know so 

356.84 361.81 B: so [laughter] so i agreed to do it i wasn't quite sure exactly how it'd work and i'm 

356.92 357.98 A: (( true )) 

362.83 373.44 B: from the email that i got it wasn't clear to me exactly exactly what was being studied and how i i know they're recording these conversations but i don't really know um 

364.85 365.84 A: right 

374.69 378.36 B: what it is that they're doing what the aim is but i guess 

378.69 386.37 B: if we knew they probably don't want us to know because if we knew we could skew it one way or the other either accidentally or on purpose so 

384.08 385.56 A: (( absolutely mhm )) 

386.80 392.64 B: i don't know anyway seasonal illnesses [laughter] so if we don't have those much 

392.68 396.71 B: um i don't know if are are there any things that we're not suppo- i mean 

396.79 398.72 B: um like 

398.89 402.30 B: am i supposed to say that i live in california 

402.08 404.14 A: well i'm oh i'm in new york 

403.58 406.74 B: in new york oh okay well huh 

404.53 405.40 A: yeah 

407.94 409.56 B: and 

408.02 412.18 A: right so how long is this discussion supposed to take right 

411.48 417.30 B: uh we're supposed to talk for ten minutes and somehow they're going to indicate to us when the ten minutes is over 

417.16 418.24 A: (( oh okay )) 

418.39 423.88 B: so um we're just sort of uh [laughter] faking our way through this at the at the moment i guess 

423.15 424.55 A: [laughter] 

423.99 425.09 B: (( um )) 

425.10 427.91 B: how did you find out about this project 

427.68 434.20 A: [noise] um my wife um who was in online exactly the same way through through email 

432.37 433.46 B: uh-huh 

434.03 435.78 B: oh yeah mm 

436.35 440.84 B: yeah i don't know how my daughter found out about it but she sent me something the other day 

441.23 455.04 B: and so i said okay what's the worst that'll happen i guess we can if there's some topic they propose a topic that people feel uncomfortable with we can just say we don't wanna talk about it and decline but 

453.07 453.74 A: (( right )) 

455.31 456.29 B: anyway 

456.37 458.37 B: (( um mm mm ))
