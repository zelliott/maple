239.00 243.30 B: y- well it's some type of thing it's kind of like karate or 

243.54 251.87 B: something like that or ju jitsu or something i'm familiar with it i i i've never done it never taken the lessons or anything 

245.31 246.52 A: yeah

249.78 251.47 A: yeah 

251.59 252.70 A: (( [laughter] )) 

252.94 256.49 B: so how does it work w- how is it different from say 

256.72 259.13 B: (( karate judo uh [noise] )) 

259.15 260.64 A: uh it's to music 

261.46 263.79 A: and it's uh it's more fast paced 

264.20 268.22 B: so it's oh it's a- now tae bo is really kind of like 

268.97 273.38 B: a lot of times it's offered in conjunction with uh aerobics 

269.06 270.29 A: little billy boy 

271.92 272.65 A: (( [noise] )) 

273.23 275.09 A: (( yeah exactly it's a mix )) 

273.72 275.64 B: (( it's similar to aerobics )) 

275.45 277.23 A: yeah it's a mix 

276.88 282.24 B: okay so it's really not for self defence it's really for the exercise right 

283.10 284.79 A: right 

285.52 287.23 A: yeah 

285.95 287.34 B: i'm sorry 

287.35 289.07 A: yeah yeah 

288.26 294.82 B: okay that's what i was thinking okay at first i was thinking when you said tae bo i was thinking it would be like 

291.08 291.99 A: right 

295.29 298.79 B: judo or like a defence a- a- 

298.87 303.03 B: certain type of of sport similar to karate or 

303.17 305.01 B: something like that 

304.92 306.21 A: right right 

305.52 308.38 B: for self defence purposes or something 

308.39 309.18 A: (( uh-huh )) 

309.82 314.04 B: but no i've never tried that so you do tae bo on 

312.25 313.19 A: right 

314.28 317.46 B: a regular basis or just every now and then or 

317.47 320.15 A: every now and then yeah 

321.80 324.19 B: [noise] so do you think it burns a lot 

324.72 327.71 A: (( yeah )) 

327.84 328.63 A: hello 

328.43 335.37 B: yeah ju- i s- i'm on a speakerphone now i was asking do you think it burns a lot of calories when you do the tae bo 

335.69 340.70 A: oh yeah i think it does yeah yeah 

341.18 343.27 A: it's a good work out 

341.39 349.89 B: well i like the ca- it's good to kind of change up a little because sometimes you get burned out on walking on running or you know 

348.17 349.37 A: right 

349.83 357.43 B: i kind of switch up i'm i might i try to jog maybe a couple of times a week and then i'll walk for an hour 

355.17 355.96 A: (( [noise] )) 

357.76 359.07 A: (( right [noise] )) 

358.23 369.66 B: and then go biking you know maybe once or tw- maybe on the weekend go biking and do different things so i don't get too bored with the same thing you know 

371.67 374.39 B: that seems to work pretty well for me 

373.00 376.08 A: (( right )) 

376.57 378.81 B: o- other than that i mean

386.33 386.89 A: (( [mn] )) 

390.52 391.68 A: (( [cough] yeah )) 

391.12 394.19 B: no allergies or anything i mean well i've had
