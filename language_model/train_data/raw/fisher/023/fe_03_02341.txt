147.12 148.13 A: yeah 

149.51 151.40 A: (( that could be that could be )) 

150.90 155.84 B: because i spoke to someone yesterday from pennsylvania and i'm just like [mn] you have an accent

161.75 163.55 B: [laughter] 

164.50 167.54 B: yeah that's me [laughter] 

168.43 175.22 B: [laughter] well i'm from queens um like my whole life so like right near j._f._k. so 

171.58 173.46 A: oh yeah

175.65 178.37 B: you definitely definitely hear it 

177.92 179.38 A: yeah 

178.76 183.19 B: so what are we supposed to be discussing [laughter] the personal [mn] 

180.36 184.25 A: oh i know the question was which did we think was worse 

184.76 188.07 A: and i forget was it smoking or drinking 

185.70 189.43 B: um smoking drinking 

189.01 190.86 A: not exercising 

190.58 191.94 B: (( overeating )) 

191.28 192.68 A: overeating 

192.45 194.48 B: and there was something else but i don't 

193.49 197.29 A: and something else 'cause i think that something else was what i thought was worse too 

197.53 199.34 B: 'cause i don't think [mn] 

198.99 200.49 A: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

199.76 203.04 B: [sigh] i don't think anything's like horrific [laughter] 

203.03 211.05 A: no [mn] e- everything in well let's see probably overeating if you overeat too much and you get huge 

203.09 203.65 B: (( [noise] )) 

207.46 208.65 B: yeah i'm 

210.51 211.69 B: right 

211.10 212.91 A: yeah 

212.17 218.23 B: i would say that's i guess the worst out of all of them but i think it's kind of weird how they're 

219.02 228.76 B: like in the same grouping of topics they're doing something like drinking and then something like not exerci- like i don't know it just it's kind of like a broad range of 

228.89 231.46 B: habits that they're talking about 

228.93 232.88 A: bad habits yeah it is they're all totally different 

233.26 237.42 A: yeah none of them are good [laughter] 

235.36 239.35 B: (( no [laughter] they're all okay in [noise] moderation [laughter] )) 

238.13 242.30 A: [laughter] well i think it said excessive drinking so 

242.81 247.22 B: true i mean everything has its you know ramifications 

246.87 248.12 A: (( uh yep )) 

248.29 249.96 A: yep that's true [mn] 

250.64 256.95 A: but being overweight i think is bad 'cause there's just so many health things related to that 

256.76 257.87 B: true 

257.42 261.40 A: yeah and it leads to so many different problems 

261.26 267.73 B: i mean if you're going to like kind of say something like that i mean i smoke but smoking you could say the same exact thing 

267.56 269.59 A: oh yeah oh you smoke really 

269.32 272.01 B: yeah well more socially but 

271.56 272.54 A: yeah 

272.35 273.48 B: yeah 

273.18 275.97 A: all my friends uh used to smoke in high school 

275.98 278.91 A: so i would try it but i never took to it 

279.13 287.22 A: [mn] i'm so glad i never took to it [laughter] even my ex husband i have um i've been married twice and my first husband used to smoke 

287.18 288.36 B: really 

287.53 290.31 A: and still i never picked it up yeah 

290.22 292.43 B: well i think if i was like um 

292.59 297.05 B: married to someone who didn't smoke i would smoke so much less 

297.40 301.28 B: like i like whenever i date someone who doesn't smoke i won't smoke around them 

301.03 302.24 A: oh yeah 

301.64 304.24 B: and now it's illegal anyway in bars 

304.31 305.95 B: to smoke so 

305.65 307.49 A: is it illegal everywhere 

307.29 311.64 B: um not everywhere but in new york um 

308.14 309.18 A: in new york 

312.17 314.53 B: not yet because i know 

314.71 325.01 B: like long island like the beginning of long island it is but like once you get to like suffolk which is kind of going more out i- it's not 

323.02 324.19 A: yeah 

325.22 327.61 B: illegal yet but it's going to be 

327.22 331.62 A: oh yeah that's what's happening even here in our town [mn] um 

331.83 335.26 A: they're considering the smoking ban in restaurants and bars 

335.98 339.53 B: (( [mn] [noise] [mn] i think it's crazy i think it's so crazy )) 

337.50 338.86 A: yeah 

339.21 347.55 A: i know but it kind of cracks me up when you go into a place and they say would you like smoking or non smoking and the non smoking is right next to the smoking so [laughter] 

346.80 351.30 B: yeah well i think like restaurants and stuff that that's like totally different 

351.02 352.11 A: yeah 

351.50 354.81 B: or any place with food but um 

352.94 353.94 A: yeah 

355.33 358.90 B: [lipsmack] see they're kind of like banning a habit right there [laughter] 

358.75 359.80 A: yeah 

360.97 364.83 B: kinda including yeah i know that [noise] they 

364.05 369.58 A: there is there's a lot of public places where you can't smoke now a lot of buildings where you can't smoke 

370.15 374.28 B: i remember when i went to boston like no one was smoking in the bar 

373.90 375.58 A: (( and oh )) 

374.53 379.37 B: and it like wasn't ill- like i felt like a lot of people don't smoke there as opposed to new york 

379.11 385.99 A: oh really no i've never noticed that in fact um we just had a party for a friend of mine we had it in a bar 

379.81 380.86 B: mhm 

386.15 388.15 A: um it was her fortieth birthday 

388.26 396.17 A: ah and the next day my throat was so dry it was killing me because everyone was smoking there and i you know i was breathing in all that smoke 

397.55 399.38 B: [lipsmack] that's so weird because 

398.57 402.11 A: (( no i definitely haven't noticed less smoking around here )) 

402.38 404.75 B: when does it become illegal there 

405.06 406.80 A: um i think 

407.31 410.26 A: like i- it's uh i think it's place by 

410.34 415.00 A: place by place like i'm not quite sure i haven't been in boston for a long time 

415.43 422.36 A: [mn] i don't smoke so i don't pay attention so i'm not sure if it's banned in boston [laughter] but i know here in our town 

418.27 419.34 B: [laughter] 

422.53 425.76 A: um they're considering it so that might go through [lipsmack] 

426.81 431.99 A: and there's several other towns around here where it's banned in restaurants and bars 

433.61 435.70 A: seems kind of silly in a bar 

433.71 434.53 B: (( oh )) 

436.20 437.82 A: (( you know yeah )) 

436.26 437.44 B: yeah 

438.06 444.08 B: no that's my con- that's exactly how i feel 'cause i think it kind of goes together [lipsmack] 

443.47 445.90 A: mhm yeah yeah 

447.00 452.37 B: but like restaurants i understand definitely understand 

450.41 451.31 A: yeah 

451.75 454.58 A: yeah 'cause there's families and things yeah 

455.19 456.88 A: so a little different 

457.95 460.21 A: [mn] so you having nice weather in new york 

459.69 462.49 B: um today yes [laughter] 

461.86 463.18 A: yeah

465.26 466.68 A: oh real yeah 

466.79 468.26 A: it was a bad winter 

467.92 469.12 B: mhm

486.52 488.21 B: (( that's so crazy )) 

487.62 491.99 A: uh yeah and if it wasn't snowing it was really cold so you didn't want to go out 

491.61 493.03 B: yeah

500.15 505.66 A: yeah i know if you had an errand to run i would i would just put it off 'cause i didn't want to go out 

506.67 510.33 B: that also causes me to think that the summer is going to be really hot 

510.64 514.97 A: i know last summer was hot though did you have a hot summer yeah we had that too 

512.92 513.92 B: yeah
