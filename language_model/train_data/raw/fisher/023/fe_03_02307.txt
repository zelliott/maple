2.12 3.72 A: hi i'm daniella 

3.59 4.79 B: hi daniella 

4.76 6.86 A: okay i've never done one of these have you 

6.17 18.32 B: never have i so let's just start i have allergies really bad in the spring so i have to go in to the doctor usually several times to get drugs new new prescriptions this season i had to change 

7.08 7.86 A: (( [laughter] okay )) 

18.36 20.58 B: what about you do you get allergies a lot 

20.55 26.54 A: i do i actually um take shots self administer on a every other week 

25.97 27.91 B: does that make you sicker 

27.93 30.92 B: once you take the shots or does it get better during the spring 

30.90 37.40 A: um i believe it gets better i've been taking it for like seven years so i don't even remember how it is for the health 

36.09 37.33 B: really 

37.64 49.28 B: yeah i have i get i take allegra d. or allegra now and that helps during the spring see there in the fall and all i don't really get sick it's usually just during the spring i get colds and sore throats and everything else from the allergies 

37.73 38.59 A: (( i just )) 

40.68 42.02 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

50.02 53.09 B: but during the what about winter do you get sick during the winter 

50.26 51.05 A: (( [mn] )) 

53.75 60.92 A: ah i do but i don't think that's allergies i think that's just you know it's freezing outside and yeah didn't bring a hat 

57.26 59.16 B: yeah just a cold and stuff 

60.72 67.18 B: yeah but you do do you like it asks do you wait the seven days and then go to the doctor or you just wait until you break a fever or 

67.37 75.88 A: in i currently don't have insurance so unless unless the arm is falling off the body or you know it's 

70.20 71.21 B: oh 

75.03 76.05 B: yeah 

76.03 78.53 A: yeah unfortunately but 

77.47 80.50 B: but see that's me too i just don't want even want to 

80.73 89.62 B: go in unless it's absolutely necessary [laughter] so i just don't even want to do it because it's so much hassle to get in and see the doctor and 

83.64 84.74 A: right 

89.51 96.21 B: so usually i just wait till i'm deathly ill and have been running a fever for four days before i go in [laughter] 

95.21 100.76 A: right nobody even i people usually come out sicker just sitting in the waiting room for an hour with people 

98.48 99.26 B: yeah 

100.02 105.40 B: exactly well the but see i try to stay to stay home if i'm running a fever because i don't want to take it to work 

105.65 113.84 B: you know because then there's the people that come to work bring it to work and then they spread it around and then everyone gets sick so then that makes the whole office 

105.91 106.78 A: (( right it )) 

113.95 118.36 B: you know sick and that's not fun because then you start running even a higher fever and you know 

118.82 124.39 A: [laughter] it that that kills morale however it's a shame to waste uh you know 

119.15 120.04 B: so 

123.99 136.55 B: vacation time [laughter] i know it's like a win it's a lose lose situation either you know stay home and lose the pay or you 

124.98 126.29 A: exactly 

136.73 139.04 B: go to the doctor and get sicker so i don't know 

139.46 148.52 B: but yeah normally the spring is when i usually get the sickest which i think is all related back to allergies 'cause during the winter i'm not bad and the fall i'm not bad and summer well 

149.21 154.46 B: you know how that is you're just to busy during the summer to go do anything i mean to get to even go anywhere to get sick 

154.87 155.75 A: right 

155.20 157.71 B: uh what about do you have kids that get sick 

158.05 163.97 A: no i i i'm not mar- i don't have kids um i'm a kid myself i like to think so uh 

161.07 161.89 B: (( no )) 

162.91 165.69 B: [laughter] 

164.84 168.37 A: yes but my dogs my dogs sneeze a lot though 

168.24 169.34 B: really 

168.67 169.90 A: uh so i don't 

170.08 174.06 A: yeah i i understand dogs can get allergies as well so i've been told 

172.67 174.17 B: i would believe that 

174.25 181.50 B: huh i wonder see my dog let's see they've gotten but here we're talking about dogs it didn't say we had to talk about pe- just people did it 

174.33 175.33 A: yeah 

181.54 187.97 B: [laughter] 'cause let's see my dog when we adopted him one of um one of our dogs we adopted him we uh 

188.34 196.67 B: had been on that certain food and it he got sick 'cause we started feeding him something else 'cause our the food didn't get delivered and we had to take him to the doctor and he had stomach stuff so 

196.92 199.77 B: it was not fun that's another thing stomach stuff 

199.70 200.83 A: [laughter] 

199.99 206.81 B: that's a stomach bugs now that's the worst you know 'cause it i mean you can't even if you go to work you can't really do anything you 

203.62 204.58 A: (( yes )) 

206.90 210.50 B: either have a trash can up to you or you're in the bathroom how gross is that 

207.26 208.17 A: right 

209.01 210.28 A: [laughter] 

210.63 213.73 B: you know so you might as well stay home and not give it to everyone else 

214.00 215.89 A: right and 

214.95 215.91 B: (( [sigh] )) 

215.92 219.52 A: yeah i you can pretty much find an excuse to stay home every day if you 

218.67 224.64 B: [laughter] yeah [laughter] my throat hurts bad [cough] yeah that's it [laughter] 

220.02 221.85 A: it's always something 

225.87 235.82 B: so what else did it say we needed to talk about we're on the illness so we talked about mm going to the doctor which neither of us like to do unless we're deathly ill and 

231.90 232.85 A: right 

234.43 235.59 A: (( right )) 

235.61 241.84 B: just being sick period now i wonder if we can move on to other topic or it has to be illness mm 

237.43 238.04 A: (( yeah )) 

240.97 242.51 A: [laughter] 

242.78 257.01 B: let's see last time i was sick uh well actually last week i had laryngitis i had my sore throat was so bad i had laryngitis and couldn't talk at work oh it was great [laughter] sorry i can't answer the phone i can't talk to customers you'll need to do it

251.76 252.96 A: (( yeah [laughter] [laughter] )) 

257.12 260.17 A: yeah i that that could work to your advantage 

260.56 261.54 A: yeah 

260.79 261.96 B: yeah i would think 

262.39 268.80 A: no i coincidentally i was sick as well last week i was um dehydrated and in bed for like three and a half four days 

265.70 267.11 B: oh 

268.56 269.97 B: really 

269.76 270.91 A: yeah 

270.61 274.17 B: so you just hadn't been drinking water and you'd been doing exercising or 

274.28 275.25 A: (( i'm sorry )) 

274.88 277.91 B: you've been exercising and not drinking your water or 

277.45 281.01 A: i i am training for a marathon and i just did 

281.68 287.06 A: you know a ten mile sprint and yeah and and drank alcohol that eve- 

285.57 287.44 B: (( you were training for a marathon )) 

287.40 291.05 A: yeah and then i had alcohol and i think the combination of 

290.89 292.37 B: no fluid 

291.09 293.73 A: (( no fluids together exactly )) 

293.15 295.98 B: plus oh my word 

294.18 299.60 A: yeah so i yes on on the upside though i i now take it very seriously 

299.61 300.92 A: to hydrate 

300.71 307.77 B: wow i'm impressed just with that [laughter] what you just training for a marathon 

301.78 302.82 A: so 

303.76 304.56 A: oh 

308.11 315.47 B: wow yeah yeah just the training for the marathon that kinda threw me off for a second i was like what wow that's cool [laughter] 

308.16 310.24 A: oh yeah 

314.71 319.20 A: [laughter] yeah well i i my understanding is that i mean it's for some training but 

319.16 333.54 A: um usually the body the immune system just gets lowered 'cause there's such wear and tear on the body especially as the miles are increasing like i think up to fifteen mile mark it just yeah it's very easy to get sick and 

324.74 325.79 B: yeah 

330.38 331.21 B: (( so is )) 

332.93 336.98 B: so is your trainer forcing vitamin c. and stuff on you or what 

336.79 341.43 A: no not yet 'cause i'm only at like the ten miles it's just not 

341.73 345.15 A: in in the jogging world that's nothing to even brag about 

345.28 346.48 A: but uh 

346.72 355.79 A: yeah yeah but it's it's they really they're advocating they will start advocating like the vitamin c. and you know stay off alcohol and just sleep and 

346.75 347.83 B: wow 

355.80 357.77 A: and stuff like that 

357.23 359.03 B: wow huh 

358.33 359.50 A: (( 'cause it's )) 

359.30 360.20 B: yeah 

360.17 374.85 B: i can my husband he used to be in the military and he would come in after their reg marches and stuff he was a combat medic so he would have the [laughter] bags of i._v.s and stuff they'd just hook them up while they were running you know go off to the side for a few minutes hook them up to an i._v. let them re hydrate and then keep running 

375.37 382.99 B: so he he would come home several times when he hadn't had one and he was ill ill ill from not being just hydrated 

383.36 384.84 B: so like wow 

384.77 398.59 B: that's neat i mean neat that you're training for a marathon i'm just kinda shocked not neat that you were sick no that's bad shame on you daniella you should not take care of yourself there is that enough mothering there for you [laughter] 

387.06 388.09 A: oh 

389.59 390.99 A: [laughter] 

396.25 403.82 A: yeah thank you i think 'cause i don't i don't get it from my mother and grandmother so yeah and all my friends [laughter] 

400.24 414.01 B: [laughter] yeah don't tell them that that you were that sick from not drinking water you'd or not drinking anything you yeah they would not be happy [laughter] mom yeah by the way i've been in bed for three days i didn't drink enough water so you know hey 

413.97 415.67 B: [laughter] 

415.79 424.21 B: wow that's impressive so well once the immune system goes down suppose i mean you you start just getting colds and stuff or or what 

415.95 417.54 A: yeah 

423.97 425.04 A: um 

425.04 426.36 B: did he say 

426.79 438.78 A: it i didn't you know i i didn't i didn't really ask so much about it i have friends that have trained and they they said that um it's pretty much colds a lot and just it like they're susceptible to everything 

426.98 428.47 B: or the trainer say 

438.16 441.28 B: to sinus infection cold whatever 

441.27 443.46 A: pretty yeah pretty much 

443.13 455.32 B: wow i never see that never would of crossed my mind that because you're working your metabolism's working so hard and so much overtime that that would drop your immune system it never even occurred to me 

444.24 445.54 A: pretty much yeah 

455.36 459.60 B: 'cause you would think since you're exercising your white count would be up and all that stuff but hm 

455.75 456.47 A: (( mm )) 

460.11 462.21 B: wow that's interesting 

460.23 461.14 A: great 

461.22 462.05 A: well 

462.46 463.15 B: (( hm )) 

462.76 464.24 A: yeah 

464.14 471.77 B: well i guess okay i'm about done on the illness thing that's a bad thing i don't get sick so it's hard to talk on it [laughter] 

469.56 470.42 A: [laughter] 

470.58 473.96 A: well i that's that's a good thing that if you 

473.44 487.39 B: well see my husband though he'll he'll wait till he's he won't even go to the doctor he hates going to doctors from all the i guess poking and prodding that he had when he was in the army because if you had a sniffle they you know made him always go so he waits un- 

485.18 485.86 A: (( know mm )) 

487.47 499.14 B: let's see he finally went to the doctor i had to force him to go to the doctor 'cause he fell at his job and popped some tendons in his leg that was the first time he'd been to the doctor i think since he'd gotten out of the army which was five years ago 

499.70 500.55 A: (( god )) 

500.39 505.13 B: and he just went and he just twisted his ankle and really bad and sprained it but 

505.43 512.30 B: he won't go either i mean he can be running a fever and and have the flu and he won't go well not the flu but you know 

512.41 516.80 B: like a bronchitis or something and he won't go it's like husband that's 

512.81 513.70 A: right 

516.99 519.79 B: you're sick go to the doctor so 

519.81 527.18 B: guess we could pretty much uh the doc- no one likes going to the doctor for the money reason and for the fact that you usually get sicker when you go 

527.30 528.48 A: (( right )) 

528.64 530.57 B: hm so anyway 

530.93 531.91 A: yeah 

531.03 535.26 B: does your family or any do does your family have any illnesses like genetic 

535.45 537.55 A: um i'm actually 

537.61 538.38 A: (( i it's )) 

538.46 544.59 A: quite silly i don't i don't think so i actually interestingly i'm a carrier for two genetic diseases 

544.09 545.13 B: really 

544.86 552.76 A: um which is um i'm actually jewish so it's a it's kind of a it's within the jewish population usually before 

548.54 549.23 B: (( oh )) 

551.81 554.28 B: enlighten me 'cause my mom is um 

554.80 560.41 B: converting to messianic judaism so enlighten me 'cause she has um or friends 

558.83 559.60 A: well 

559.78 563.87 A: okay well this this is genetic so she can't she can't get it right 

561.96 565.82 B: no no but i'm saying she has the genetic or she has friends that are 

566.54 567.64 B: jewish 

566.54 571.59 A: pretty it's more of an eastern european primarily that concentration 

571.23 572.04 B: huh 

571.71 574.94 A: um and so there's there's like seven main 

574.95 576.63 A: diseases um 

578.19 580.51 A: familial disorder nomia 

581.55 587.66 A: it's it's i don't remember all of them and see usually um when people marry kind of within that same 

588.11 599.89 A: uh other people from that same background um they usually go for a blood test prior to marriage to make sure they're not a match 'cause if they're both carriers there's like i think like a twenty five per cent chance that their kids will 

590.02 590.82 B: uh-huh 

593.32 594.55 B: wow
