41.93 51.84 B: no no smoking actually smirking i heard her say after the gossiping and then later on i heard smirking um i heard ah smoking but that's okay 

45.31 46.72 A: no smoking 

51.97 55.18 A: okay what do you think is the worst one 

52.66 54.54 B: (( yeah not exercising )) 

55.72 58.03 B: w- i'm sorry [laughter] 

57.45 59.33 A: which one do you think is worse 

59.25 63.92 B: well i don't know i'm looking over all of those things not ex- i guess 

64.39 65.85 B: right now 

67.12 71.21 B: if you're talking about over indulging in all those things 

71.65 73.30 B: maybe alcohol 

73.45 74.65 A: alcohol 

74.18 75.86 B: yeah because 

76.07 80.12 B: that to me that's pretty close to smoking but um 

80.40 89.22 B: nah you know what i'll change my answer smoking 'cause it disturbs me yeah yeah 'cause if i'm next to somebody that's smoking that's the worst [cough] 

83.42 84.38 A: (( smoking )) 

89.36 101.92 B: in other words i can control myself but i can't control other people if they're drinking it doesn't bother me unless they're out driving and drinking but if they're smoking and ah i'm in a public place or 

89.54 91.54 A: oh yeah it bothers you that much 

102.43 105.27 B: ah where are you from it makes a difference 

104.41 105.41 A: l._a. 

105.91 113.70 B: oh okay so am i so you know it's a little bit different out here in california but when we go to las vegas for instance i can't stand it because do you smoke 

113.56 114.36 A: no 

114.08 119.64 B: okay good [laughter] so i'm in las vegas at a casino or something and i'm next to you know you can't get away from it 

119.62 121.59 A: uh-huh yeah yeah 

120.99 123.78 B: yeah that's my worst what's yours 

124.96 126.38 A: (( um )) 

126.60 137.72 A: i don't really know um i think also smoking w- actually excessively drinking i think is w- i- i- is the worst one because it affects your mental stability 

138.50 146.66 A: and it makes people yeah it affects people's personalities while smoking just you know affects human bodies 

146.73 155.45 A: so i i personally think that you know excessively drinking is the worst but ah long term like ah 

152.44 153.42 B: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

155.52 159.75 A: long term concentration i i think smoking is probably 

160.09 169.04 A: the worst i mean it it depends if you do alcohol in moderation i think smoking is worse but if you drink too much i think smoking is not as bad 

169.04 172.59 B: mhm okay well we kind of agree i think we're pretty close 

172.68 173.85 A: yeah 

172.95 174.49 B: they both can be ah 

175.22 177.24 A: so how do you feel about gossip 

175.50 176.69 B: equally bad 

178.10 182.61 B: hm that ah i don't know i don't mind that too much i mean if people gossip 

182.65 183.56 B: i just 

182.98 184.21 A: you don't 

184.34 185.73 B: no i don't gossip 

186.29 194.73 B: but if they gossip about me well more power to them because i'm not much to gossip about i guess [laughter] so that doesn't bother me um 

193.54 194.60 A: no 

194.66 202.02 B: exercising not exercising not taking care of your body that's i do that all the time i exercise all the time and i try not to over eat but 

202.21 204.70 B: i think exercising is important too 

205.56 217.20 B: it it's interesting that they would group them this way though i mean they're not to me the same kind of thing i mean alcohol and smoking can become addictive um 

217.69 219.84 B: whereas these other things are just 

217.75 221.45 A: yes but the topic is personal habits so 

221.22 222.20 B: yeah 

221.60 229.21 A: i don't think that i- i- the topic is the issue of smoking or drinking it's about personal habits 

228.66 229.83 B: yeah 

229.43 231.95 A: so all all of these you know 

231.82 234.47 B: i guess i never thought of gossiping as a habit 

234.92 235.75 B: but 

235.18 242.56 A: yeah you're right gossip to me is the only one that doesn't really fit the group i agree on this one yeah i think so too 

239.81 240.59 B: yeah 

240.79 241.64 B: right 

241.79 243.63 B: mhm 

243.76 244.62 B: yeah 

243.97 246.11 A: and then um 

246.68 249.70 A: so how yeah how do you feel about over eating do 

250.70 252.67 A: you think that's a bad habit 

252.77 255.88 B: oh sure yeah i mean it disturbs me you know 

256.12 260.36 B: ah it disturbs me when i see people that are excessively over weight 

260.85 261.90 A: uh-huh 

260.93 268.77 B: and and they seem to be assisted by people that live with them you know you see these people i'm talking people that are really obese 

268.99 274.82 B: the kind of people that they can't they can't even walk you know you see these people four or five hundred pounds 

269.33 270.40 A: okay 

274.90 276.09 A: mhm 

275.13 286.76 B: and i'm looking at them and i'm going how in the world number one can they afford it and who's making all this food who's buying this food for them you know the kind of people i'm talking about sometimes you see them in these news 

286.80 292.23 B: ah broadcasts where you see somebody that you know they had to open up the wall of his house to bring him out 

292.25 293.37 A: yeah 

293.28 299.38 B: where you know who is the person that is assisting that that person's almost as guilty as the person that's doing the eating 

299.60 305.45 B: because they're buying them all the junk food and everything else he needs and how they can afford it again is beyond me too 

306.18 308.11 A: how do you feel about the caffeine 

308.96 319.61 B: that one doesn't bother me at all yeah i mean i don't i don't know of anyone that excessive caffeine yeah it's a lot i mean ah i don't know that it happens that often really 

311.40 313.36 A: you don't think it's the 

320.20 326.26 A: well if somebody has let's say three or four cups of coffee a day y- you think that's a good habit or 

325.89 330.49 B: well i don't think that's going to harm you like these other things would 

330.63 334.19 B: maybe long long term it's possible i guess but 

331.13 332.60 A: not as much 

334.12 340.83 A: yeah but it's not as much you know as if somebody would smoke a pack of cigarettes a day yeah i think so too 

338.51 340.70 B: (( mhm but )) 

341.28 348.00 B: i guess i go back to the habits that um that affect other people that annoys me you know that 

348.03 353.39 B: i almost don't mind too much if somebody's locked in their own house and they're smoking or drinking whatever and they're not 

353.53 360.15 B: affecting anyone else's lives but when they get out and they dr- start driving car after they're been drinking or again if they're smoking 

360.14 368.94 B: where i have to breathe the smoke second hand and they have no concern about anyone else but themselves that really disturbs me so 

369.11 373.70 B: i guess that influences how i i view these things and 

369.34 370.47 A: okay 

373.93 376.82 B: again gossiping is not one that you know 

377.57 379.28 A: you don't think it 

378.01 380.64 B: harms me in any way i mean that's just a 

380.38 381.44 A: excuse me 

381.28 386.78 B: that doesn't seem to harm me any way once one way or the other i mean so what i mean so somebody wants to gossip about 

386.11 389.63 A: no i disagree on this one i- it can harm people 

389.23 390.82 B: (( really have you all right have you been )) 

390.07 391.62 A: yes i think so 

391.30 394.40 B: ((  )) 

393.76 397.03 A: i'm not talking about me personally i'm just talking generally 

396.10 398.01 B: (( i mean i'll never meet you )) 

397.76 398.96 A: um 

398.79 401.79 B: ((  )) 

401.86 406.62 A: no i'm just just saying we don't want to get it personal here but um 

402.53 403.69 B: (( i guess )) 

406.20 407.59 B: (( this is only my second one oh )) 

407.69 409.02 A: excuse me 

408.43 412.99 B: ((  )) 

412.94 414.61 A: yes it's also my second one 

414.21 419.89 B: ((  )) 

415.96 416.96 A: but 

418.98 431.13 A: yeah yeah yeah yeah it's it's d- the other time but you know it doesn't matter um but yeah i think gossip can harm other people because um 

431.26 436.08 A: i don't know if if you spread rumors that are not quite true or 

439.14 440.21 A: (( no )) 

440.42 441.47 A: (( matter )) 

441.51 444.80 A: (( if it's true or not )) 

444.99 446.01 A: (( at )) 

448.01 449.36 A: (( least )) 

456.37 460.03 A: you're gonna you know look at them differently a little bit 

460.12 464.62 A: so i think it it affects people's perception of you 

466.65 467.55 B: yeah 

466.87 471.57 A: which m- might result in in adverse reactions 

471.18 477.32 B: hm i just can't yeah but again it's me it's just feelings um 

474.28 475.49 A: so i don't 

477.41 488.97 A: yeah i mean but to me personally to me personally feelings are more important than physical things i would prefer being around somebody that's smoking all the time than being around somebody that's 

477.91 479.81 B: but the other things are physical things you 

482.66 483.75 B: (( know oh really )) 

488.99 492.18 A: that's ah ah hurting my feelings 

491.59 493.08 B: really hm 

492.45 493.47 A: (( yes )) 

493.77 506.13 A: b- i mean it depends you seem like not to be an emotional person which is fine but i am so for me that would be more important i could not stand you know being around a rude person for example or or being 

506.18 509.31 A: around a person that that spreads negative 

509.61 511.25 A: rumors or something i 

511.32 512.06 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

512.08 513.23 B: (( oh okay very interesting )) 

513.79 519.49 A: guess i think that gossiping i- is harmful and should not 

519.61 523.46 A: i- i- it's something that for example would bother me 

523.08 523.96 B: uh-huh 

525.18 527.03 B: all right well that's fair enough 

527.61 528.65 B: (( but ah )) 

527.93 533.47 A: yeah i mean you know we all have different personalities and different environments so 

530.18 531.60 B: (( yeah hm )) 

533.54 537.17 B: how do you feel about the people that don't exercise is that anything that 

536.70 540.94 A: ah no because actually that's everybody's own decision 

540.68 543.78 B: (( yeah like their responsibility mhm )) 

541.21 542.97 A: that doesn't bother me at all 

543.61 551.97 A: yeah i mean that's you know some people just don't enjoy it and some do and that i don't think you should make make people that don't enjoy it make 'em do it no 

551.51 552.36 B: (( mhm fair enough )) 

552.33 554.70 A: i don't think that would be right 

556.40 558.31 A: but um 

558.63 560.33 A: how do you feel about that 

560.60 567.59 B: hm um well i kind of feel like it fits in with people that over eat just people that c- don't take care of their own body 

568.03 580.12 B: so yeah it kind of disturbs me when i see that you know people that that ah just are not able to do the physical things that they should be able to do only because they don't take care of themselves so 

580.45 582.46 A: but how can that bother you 

583.50 588.57 B: yeah well i don't know that it really bothers me um 

588.62 591.09 B: maybe it motivates me more [laughter] i don't know 

591.15 594.03 B: yeah i guess it really doesn't bother me 

594.08 596.92 B: ah i think it annoys me a little bit 

594.30 599.46 A: what if you saw a person if you saw a person if you saw a person um
