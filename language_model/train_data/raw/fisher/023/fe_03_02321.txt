251.07 254.37 A: hey you know it's interesting for a like if they 

251.12 252.36 B: in its own way 

254.65 264.23 A: for maybe a couple of days [laughter] and then you know it's like it's a lot of pressure and it's like my boss wasn't the nicest person to deal with so 

256.20 257.29 B: (( oh yeah [laughter] )) 

263.90 264.84 B: yeah

271.48 275.27 A: here in new york so [laughter] but

289.58 290.59 A: (( oh okay )) 

290.85 293.54 A: yeah well hey maybe well i 

293.32 301.95 A: ba- basically went through people's you know reviews you know so i we they they had a review file about films although i'm the one who got it to all the direct- you know i 

296.40 297.81 B: [laughter] 

299.29 300.21 B: yeah 

301.83 308.56 A: um basically i took the information and you know dispersed it around to all the executives that's what my job was so 

306.86 307.85 B: right 

308.32 317.37 B: right so they could decide what to uh make based on public popularity [laughter] which is one of my big griefs with the movie industry actually [laughter] 

312.09 314.31 A: yeah uh 

315.57 316.40 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

317.04 318.70 A: um so 

318.72 321.54 A: back to i guess to the topic of illness i 

321.28 322.56 B: yeah and there is 

321.66 324.37 A: [laughter] don't know much uh 

322.74 325.43 B: there were some other things we were supposed to 

326.09 328.36 B: oh um something about 

328.99 329.90 B: (( uh )) 

330.02 341.98 B: they she said there's a saying that if you if you don't go to the doctor a cold will be over in seven days and if you do go to a doctor it will be over in one week and whether we think that's true 

342.19 344.25 A: i don't think that's true you've 

344.57 346.38 A: (( basically go you know )) 

346.96 349.24 A: i don't know a doctor's always looking to uh 

349.41 353.89 A: to they're they're all their only answer seems to be in the form of a pill so 

353.43 355.53 B: right [laughter] 

354.07 359.10 A: [laughter] they go okay come and take this and it's like i feel like i waste my time you know 

358.74 359.72 B: yeah 

359.11 372.75 A: like i'm sometimes i'm more interested in like maybe like a holistic type issue [laughter] see what they have to offer i don't really trust the what these doctors are into you know basically they're all they're all funded by you know pharmaceutical companies 

363.34 364.50 B: yeah 

372.93 375.73 A: so [laughter] they all seem you know 

373.82 380.51 B: yeah in a lot of cases what they give you is just to treat the symptoms it doesn't actually make you less sick it just 

379.38 384.30 A: (( yeah i think i'd be better off with like a sugar pill [laughter] )) 

382.08 383.04 B: [laughter] 

383.43 384.72 B: it's possible 

384.50 386.58 A: yeah um 

385.11 389.43 B: yeah actually my dad is a nurse and he says that um sometimes 

389.62 393.45 B: the medication to make you feel better can actually prolong the illness a bit 

393.40 394.67 A: yeah 

394.10 394.95 B: mhm 

394.89 397.22 A: (( so i don't know um )) 

397.59 401.04 A: is there any other questions that they had tha- that they wanted to 

399.93 403.85 B: you know i'm pretty sure there was another one and i'm not remembering what it was that's right 

403.24 405.79 A: yeah they should repeat it somewhere in the c- 

404.79 405.69 B: they should 

405.99 407.50 A: [laughter] 

406.35 410.27 B: break in half way through and say remember what you're supposed to be talking about is 

408.68 414.23 A: remember what you're talking about yeah um i don't know uh 

411.37 412.22 B: yeah 

415.09 419.65 A: wha- we wha- we d- d- did you call in or did you uh they c- you si- 

418.76 420.02 B: no they called me 

419.90 421.01 A: they called you 

420.69 421.67 B: yeah 

421.07 432.42 A: oh okay um i was like because like when they was ringing i forgot that i signed up for the stuff and i've forgotten whe- i didn't think they'd be calling me like every day i just thought they'd give me like three calls or something like that i don't know 

426.35 427.24 B: yeah 

432.34 433.75 B: yeah 

432.69 443.47 A: but they'd be spacing them out apparently i'm getting more and i got one last night and i was right i was right in the middle of watching my t- [laughter] my t._v. show [laughter] and i was kinda like oh forget about it 

436.20 437.60 B: yeah so did i 

440.50 441.65 B: [laughter] 

442.43 447.07 B: yeah i was just making cupcakes so um [laughter] fortunately i'd just pulled a batch out of the oven 

444.14 446.10 A: yeah [laughter] 

446.78 448.16 A: (( yeah it's like )) 

447.08 448.60 B: so it's okay to talk 

448.40 452.88 A: yeah i have to ho i would come or have a random conversation all of a sudden you know 

452.30 453.40 B: right 

452.89 457.77 A: it's pretty bizarre [laughter] they should give you a little bit more about the topic before hand you know 

454.00 455.16 B: [laughter] 

457.25 460.02 B: yeah maybe then you can think of some opinions on it 

458.31 463.14 A: at least then you can think of stuff to say but i don't know if they even actually touching that you know 

462.91 473.20 B: yeah i don't think it matters i think the real issue is that if they put two strangers on the phone together a lot of times what would happen is there would just be this big long ssilence so you know [laughter] 

472.87 475.78 A: [laughter] 

473.27 475.78 B: i think that's their big concern probably 

476.29 480.45 A: yeah i know so you like it out there like it in um that area 

478.63 479.40 B: (( um )) 

480.65 483.32 B: you know i don't as much as i thought i would
