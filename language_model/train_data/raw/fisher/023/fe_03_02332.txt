4.26 7.52 A: [mn] yes um you care to start first or 

7.30 11.89 B: well i guess the topic of the day is is illness and how you take care of yourself 

12.14 16.43 A: [mn] right and changes ha- having to do with the change of the seasons 

16.03 17.25 B: right mhm 

16.75 25.80 A: [mn] um well i live in california [laughter] so um fo- fortunately i don't have that problem as much as i used to uh where are you located 

25.26 28.55 B: in wisconsin so i have quite a bit of change of seasons 

27.97 33.91 A: oh okay okay i used to live in chicago for eight years so i i know i know the drill i know what it's about [mn] 

34.40 36.44 A: and how do you keep yourself well 

36.14 43.80 B: basically all i do is just [mn] take a vitamin a day and try to eat well i generally don't get colds or sick too often 

43.92 45.40 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

44.39 48.73 B: so i then when i do i ra- very rarely go to the doctor well 

48.14 55.79 A: um do you do you attribute that to diet or just um good good genes or um just tak- taking care of yourself or 

55.77 57.13 B: (( it's )) 

57.23 59.38 B: actually probably luck i guess [mn] 

59.09 60.03 A: i'm sorry 

59.60 64.29 B: i pro- probably more luck than anything i guess i don't know as far as 

63.60 64.45 A: [mn] 

64.31 70.22 B: good genes would go my my parents weren't exactly in the best of health [noise] when they were alive so 

68.59 69.55 A: mhm 

70.73 73.55 B: (( i don't know [noise] about that but )) 

73.59 74.77 A: (( [mn] right )) 

73.62 78.10 B: [noise] because i i smoke too so it is probably just pure luck i don't know [laughter] yeah 

77.27 85.01 A: oh that sh- i yeah that that sounds pretty lucky [mn] um i'm thinking back to when there were actually four seasons um 

84.82 94.62 A: yeah i i guess i didn't have the problem as much as well um but when i did um you know i tried to increase my my zinc intake my vitamin c. intake 

94.62 106.91 A: as well as um actually i went a while just doing raw garlic which was quite amazing 'cause i never got sick at all [laughter] with raw garlic so but you know then again people avoided me like the plague you know at that 

106.98 108.71 A: [laughter] 

107.60 111.37 B: [mn] you can take garlic pills which don't have the same odor i guess but 

111.08 112.38 A: i- i'm sorry 

111.86 115.18 B: [noise] you can take like gar- garlic capsules i mean capsules like 

115.18 124.86 A: yeah i'm not sure if those are as ef- i i don't know i've read different things if they are as effective or not so i'm not quite sure there [mn] um 

125.43 128.94 A: i'm trying to think um uh d- the um [lipsmack] 

129.32 132.78 A: second part of the uh question did you did you understand all that 

132.27 137.05 B: it was about seven days you if you go to the doctor after seven days or not i guess 

136.16 142.31 A: right right it was some sort of um [mn] some sort of phrase or saying [mn] 

142.37 152.64 B: and 'cause myself generally when i get a cold i just get like over the counter stuff and treat it myself i don't i don't go to the doctor unless i really absolutely have to 

152.59 153.46 A: sure 

153.55 161.75 A: sure if yeah i i totally agree um [mn] i'm definitely more in the mode of treating it yourself 

162.06 170.60 A: um you know i think it's just a h- good habit to to get into unless you're you know you really feel like your your body's telling you to get to the doctor but [mn] 

170.43 179.05 A: you know other than that i believe you know that we could take care of ourselves pretty well as you know as well [noise] and i think vitamin c. is is a big big part of that 

180.90 189.39 A: so um yeah like i said in california this is not as much of an issue as it was when i was back in chicago [laughter] 

188.34 191.37 B: yeah your seasons don't really change all too much out there 

190.75 202.56 A: no not not really i mean uh we have a we have a winter and it's um [mn] basically we get a bit more rain and the skies are very clear and it's quite it's quite nice actually and um [mn] 

202.87 211.67 A: getting slightly off topic um [mn] it's actually this is kind of a mountainous town an- and the the mountains around here can be you know quite beautiful and snow 

210.26 211.48 B: (( so you live in )) 

211.66 213.20 B: (( northern california or do )) 

211.96 213.04 A: snow capped 

213.09 214.31 A: i- i'm sorry 

213.73 216.03 B: you live in northern california or oh 

215.53 216.91 A: no in los angeles 

216.51 217.64 B: (( los angeles [noise] )) 

217.84 219.87 A: yeah yeah so 

220.14 228.61 A: but back to the the topic i suppose uh one of the big issues is seasonal affective disorder a- are you familiar with this [noise] 

228.68 236.19 B: y- s._a._d. yeah that's where [noise] i know of a lot of people in like in this part of the country get it where its lack of daylight [laughter] 

235.53 245.45 A: absolutely yeah i think i was you know affected by that definitely in in chicago and i know wisconsin's pretty much the same [mn] um november and december seem to be the worst and now 

245.28 256.74 A: as far as you know the question they asked us as far as that goes that was a little tougher to take you know because it wasn't so much ah somatic as you know something mental that you had to take care of 

256.73 262.28 A: um and you know y- y- you get like sometime four or five days of sunshine a month 

262.28 273.74 A: and you just really have to work at being happy [laughter] and that's kind of tough you know and i know in some of the northern climes um minnesota wisconsin they have you know light light therapy 

274.11 275.10 A: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

274.97 286.44 B: [noise] i know that but i've never gone for that but i think up up here more and more more after the holidays is when it starts to g- is when they talk about it getting worse because after the holiday rush gets over too that's when it more starts 

275.14 276.11 A: are you familiar 

286.52 288.12 A: yes 

286.96 288.26 B: (( attacking people )) 

288.22 289.44 A: yes 

289.49 295.53 A: and also it's you know it seems like its dark all the time and so it's it's not so much your your 

295.64 304.38 A: your you know physiological symptoms as much as your mind that you have to watch so [mn] how do you deal with that do you do you have this problem 

304.22 305.57 B: (( i )) 

305.65 309.43 B: i don't think so i mean if i do it's just it's it's just mild but 

308.83 314.26 A: okay i see yeah the winter blues and stuff i think what i do is i try to keep busy 

314.63 321.60 A: i try to work as much as possible and you know if you if you're working you know eighty hours a week you're not even thinking about that type of stuff 

320.58 331.64 B: well like i work in retail so when you work in retail after the holidays it's kind of a for the the month of january's not too bad it's when february comes around 'cause for a while you're you're you're happy to have ah 

332.75 335.26 B: the slow up so to speak 

335.57 338.30 A: right you you look forward to 

339.10 342.93 B: basically yeah you you just start enjoying the holidays and they're over with almost because 

339.26 340.20 A: (( it [mn] )) 

343.83 346.29 A: yeah that that that must be a tough 

346.63 353.93 A: tough thing for you you know working retail that you aren't really you're you just want the ah the holidays to be over i bet 

352.80 355.51 B: (( [laughter] )) 

355.76 356.75 A: is that true 

356.44 363.61 B: [noise] kind of yeah it's it cha- it varies from uh day to day actually [laughter] during the holiday time 

362.16 363.01 A: i see 

363.27 365.60 A: sure are are you in um milwaukee 

365.36 377.64 B: [mn] no i'm up way up in the in uh not quite the sticks but almost in um in northern wi- northern wisconsin north central wisconsin actually so wausau'd be the closest don't know if you've ever heard of wausau 

370.59 371.55 A: (( [mn] ))

387.18 396.91 A: i i don't i'm not sure if we answered the [laughter] the question about the yeah i think we did about the uh doctor it was some sort of saying a saying that i hadn't heard of before 

392.36 393.18 B: yeah 

396.08 400.93 B: yeah well i i was reading the thing that that i got from in the email i tried to print it off 

401.19 406.50 B: but what they the topic they gave us to start us out with well we don't have to actually stick to it per se 

405.90 407.10 A: oh is that right 

406.62 407.97 B: they said they gave us 

409.23 413.88 B: is they realize the conver- conversation of strangers have goals and whatever

422.96 423.82 A: mhm 

423.00 430.34 B: so it's just to get a get it started and it's kind of hard to talk ten minutes about being sick but 

429.76 434.82 A: right right so it's it's not so much to stay on the the topic as [mn] 

434.19 441.30 B: i don't think so it- it's to get you started and to see how strangers converse i guess
