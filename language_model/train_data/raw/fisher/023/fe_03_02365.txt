0.75 3.23 A: hello i'm michelle 

3.01 4.80 B: hi michelle i'm dale 

4.83 5.73 A: (( hi )) 

6.20 7.09 A: um 

7.74 11.53 A: i'm not real sure [laughter] how this works this is the first time they've called me 

12.88 15.42 B: yes ma'am well this is the first time i've tried also 

16.37 21.83 A: okay so um let's see i guess our topic is which of those things are worse 

21.70 22.95 B: yes ma'am 

22.93 25.42 A: um personally 

25.84 27.34 A: i think 

27.48 28.79 A: um 

29.42 32.07 A: probably drinking too much alcohol 

33.56 36.65 A: and the second would probably be smoking 

36.33 37.39 B: yes ma'am 

38.23 44.77 B: yeah that's what i would probably say too is the alcohol would be the worse one and then the smoking would be also 

45.14 46.70 B: the worst 

46.64 51.59 A: yeah because i think with alcohol because it effects your mind you know so 

52.31 56.40 A: i think drinking too much alcohol and um 

56.71 62.50 A: i don't know really why i think it's worst probably like i said it effects your mind so you really don't know what you're doing and then 

63.20 67.88 A: because i don't know gossiping that's not really that bad because i do it myself [laughter] 

67.71 68.76 B: yes ma'am 

69.80 71.07 A: and um 

71.81 73.75 A: let's see um 

74.59 76.26 A: what else was there 

77.97 82.28 A: i believe it was not exercising enough or something 

82.66 85.55 A: like that's bad but that's not going to kill you 

85.28 86.33 B: no ma'am 

87.25 88.44 A: (( but um )) 

88.87 89.95 A: (( let's see )) 

90.19 92.69 A: (( i don't really know what else to say [laughter] )) 

92.56 95.42 B: [laughter] well i i agree with everything that you say 

95.55 100.46 B: i think if you if you put you know physically offensive to the body it would be 

100.94 103.29 B: probably the alcohol or smoking 

103.69 116.29 A: yeah the smoking i think i put because my step dad he smokes like two packs a day and he's just had so many health problems it's just 

116.37 118.00 A: awful he's had 

118.65 129.54 A: heart attacks and he's had a stroke and he's got trouble breathing and i think that's probably why i think is you know cause smoking that's just really bad 

128.85 129.83 B: yes ma'am 

129.63 130.81 A: like that 

131.32 132.48 A: (( but um )) 

134.12 138.83 A: let's see here what else i can think of to say on the subject 

142.07 148.45 A: [noise] i'm so sorry my child just started crying [laughter] [noise] [laughter] come here sweetie [noise] 

143.79 145.09 B: that's okay [laughter]

153.22 154.20 B: yes ma'am [laughter] 

158.51 159.09 A: (( [noise] )) 

160.87 162.62 A: they're recording this so they're 

162.64 164.60 A: [laughter] [noise] [laughter] 

164.31 166.51 B: that's okay i'm sure he'll get used to it 

165.99 166.89 A: [laughter] 

168.10 169.88 A: (( my goodness um )) 

169.99 171.61 A: so let's see 

172.41 177.57 A: i really don't know what to say on the subject so i guess we're just suppose today talk to each other i'm not 

176.97 178.14 B: (( all righty )) 

178.02 181.23 A: sure how this works but [laughter] 

180.01 180.97 B: yes ma'am 

181.40 184.41 B: so have you ever done any opinion polls before 

181.41 182.51 A: (( [sigh] )) 

184.45 190.61 A: um i've done an opinion poll on like products like that 

190.26 191.21 B: yes ma'am 

190.98 192.66 A: like um 

192.69 196.42 A: someone called me about some computer products one time [noise] 

196.80 200.94 A: because um i'm really into computers and things 

200.29 201.63 B: mhm 

201.10 203.26 A: and uh i feel 

203.48 205.20 A: not filled it out well 

205.25 207.97 A: it was kind of half way fill out halfway 

208.45 210.57 A: i had to do the rest online 

210.29 211.61 B: mhm 

211.20 212.29 A: and 

212.34 214.62 A: i actually got paid for that too so 

214.01 216.19 B: oh that's good 

215.25 217.23 A: yeah so that was pretty nice 

217.33 218.40 B: yes ma'am 

219.06 220.40 A: and then [noise] 

222.24 224.27 A: i noticed this thing and 

224.29 226.78 B: yeah i noticed it too i thought i'd give it a try 

226.85 228.25 A: yeah 

227.28 230.11 B: this is the this is the first time i've called them 

230.19 234.47 A: yeah it's a like i said this is my first phone call so 

235.26 239.41 A: so it's as you can probably tell i'm not very shy [laughter] 

239.16 240.61 B: oh that's good though 

241.27 242.15 A: so 

242.36 245.04 A: i figured what the hey i'd give it a try 

244.74 245.77 B: yes ma'am 

246.05 250.56 B: well it sounds to me like what they're what they're gonna do is is present a topic 

250.66 254.11 B: and then take two callers and and match them together 

254.39 258.10 A: yeah i didn't know how it was gonna work then 

257.15 258.37 B: i didn't either 

258.39 260.49 A: they called and they were like 

260.66 265.35 A: please hold while we try and find another caller and i'm like oh no [laughter] 

265.65 266.84 A: (( but um )) 

267.59 274.01 A: yeah it's not that hard i don't think and i think we're supposed to keep to the subject but i don't really 

270.20 270.91 B: (( [noise] )) 

274.11 277.36 A: know anything else to say about the subject [laughter] 

274.24 275.26 B: (( [noise] )) 

276.38 277.64 B: yes ma'am 

278.13 279.29 A: (( but um )) 

279.94 289.03 A: think of what else i can think of cause i can't really remember the other options like i can't remember alcohol smoking and not exercising and gossiping and i think 

288.34 289.94 B: yes ma'am 

291.24 293.21 A: (( that's all i can remember i think there was another one )) 

293.38 295.34 B: i can't remember any others either 

294.99 296.06 A: [laughter] 

296.81 298.12 A: (( but um )) 

298.44 299.69 A: (( let's see )) 

300.63 301.47 A: (( let's )) 

301.73 305.67 A: see if i can get back to the subject i'm not real sure what to say about 

305.84 307.43 A: any of it that's all i 

308.39 310.66 A: i don't know but uh let's see 

312.07 312.85 A: (( but )) 

313.35 316.09 A: not exercising 

316.67 318.57 A: (( let's see i think )) 

319.28 322.94 B: well if you have a small child i'm gonna assume that you're getting plenty of exercise 

322.90 331.58 A: oh yes i get plenty of exercise and especially now that he's um walking almost he's trying to walk so he 

332.11 336.38 A: falls down a lot that's just what now happened [laughter] so 

334.56 335.46 B: oh 

337.78 339.86 A: it's a lot of work 

339.67 341.29 B: i can imagine 

340.60 343.00 A: he's my first and 

343.36 347.85 A: my husband's always at work now to try and 

347.90 349.25 A: help us 

349.50 351.89 A: pay bills and everything so 

352.61 357.77 A: that's why i thought i'd give this a shot cause it's ten dollars but that's ten dollars so 

357.30 358.42 B: yes ma'am 

358.55 361.49 B: so are you planning on doing the other two surveys also 

361.64 362.79 A: um 

362.92 364.95 A: i probably will 

369.72 370.87 A: [noise] but um 

371.29 378.28 A: yeah i was looking into the i can't remember what it was exactly what they called this um 

378.97 381.39 A: some kind of research thing i 

381.62 382.62 B: yes ma'am 

381.73 384.50 A: thought it would kind of be kind of nice to 

386.16 389.27 A: see you know what it was all about [cough] 

391.30 396.96 A: i think probably if they do call me back i'll probably be a little more prepared of what to expect oh [noise] 

396.55 397.72 B: yes ma'am 

399.25 403.35 B: i've got the letter here from the off line computer they call it the

416.59 418.06 B: (( well )) 

418.13 420.23 B: i don't know what else i could say either 

419.90 421.16 A: [laughter] 

420.26 422.04 B: but i agree with what you said 

423.01 429.27 A: yeah and just like i said yeah um i didn't mean to interrupt you go ahead [laughter] 

429.13 430.42 B: oh that's okay 

430.96 431.83 B: uh 

432.20 434.49 B: i guess that's about all i was going to say also 

434.04 441.73 A: [laughter] yeah but i don't know gossiping i don't really see how that could i mean i know how it's bad because 

442.47 447.21 A: i have been the victim of gossiping but it's not gonna you know 

447.50 449.14 A: hurt you and 

449.52 453.39 A: i mean it could hurt other people's feelings but that's pretty much it 

453.49 454.44 B: mhm 

453.57 454.89 A: and 

455.72 456.63 A: well 

457.80 468.69 A: i don't know i guess if you look at it at a certain point it is pretty bad but it's not going to effect your health unless you make somebody really mad [laughter] and they come after you 

464.20 465.22 B: (( yes ma'am [laughter] )) 

469.86 470.95 A: (( but uh um )) 

477.14 480.62 A: this is really strange i don't know why it feels so strange [laughter] [noise] 

482.32 484.83 A: yeah did you think that was funny [laughter] 

488.14 491.61 B: well i've been exactly where your husband's at right now 

492.21 494.15 B: my wife and i we got married 

495.42 496.70 B: eight yours ago

502.50 503.49 A: oh 

503.58 507.46 B: so she turns seven and i can remember what it was like seven years ago 

505.45 506.09 A: (( wow )) 

507.13 508.55 A: [laughter] 

508.42 511.74 B: i was out working as long and as hard as i could 

512.08 515.03 A: yeah mine will be a year old [noise] 

515.12 516.97 A: next month well [noise] 

517.47 518.68 A: in june 

519.01 521.14 A: it's not next month after next 

521.03 531.23 A: in june so he's a handful and my um job that i was working at i was a cashier and [noise] was able to make it but 

531.09 536.40 A: they were suppose today hire me back and they decided that they weren't going to that they didn't need me anymore so 

536.77 538.97 A: that kind of fell apart 

539.48 540.89 A: (( and um )) 

541.49 545.36 A: then we realised even if i did get another job 

545.59 553.51 A: that day care would be so expensive i would just be working to pay for them to take care of my child so i might as well stay home and do it myself [noise] [laughter] 

552.37 553.73 B: (( that's right )) 

553.87 555.21 A: so he's 

554.25 559.02 B: well we had that decision too with with my wife we decided that um 

559.25 563.45 B: we would let her stay home with the babies cause i have two daughters 

563.70 564.92 B: and um 

565.54 569.72 B: um cause she she worked full time up until we had our children 

570.06 576.36 B: and uh she said i'll keep working if you want me to and i said well i said i said if we can do it financially i said i think 

576.47 579.74 B: that the babies will be healthier and will be happier 

579.85 582.20 B: at home with you than in day care centre 

582.40 584.86 A: yeah that was my 

584.80 597.62 A: main thing i really honestly was hoping that [laughter] that we wouldn't be able to afford day care centre because i really wanted to stay home with him because i know in day cares they don't get nearly enough attention they need 

597.18 598.24 B: mhm 

598.02 599.72 A: (( and um ))
