180.69 181.87 A: (( category right )) 

181.19 184.10 B: in in in actually drinking 

184.16 190.60 B: certain drinks with cigarettes it kind of enhances the fun of it i mean i mean and then you talk it's like having coffee for some people 

190.64 191.59 B: and 

190.76 191.71 A: yeah 

191.72 195.90 B: you can't do that here but when i was living in new york and in chicago 

196.03 207.95 B: i mean that law didn't exist so that's how if i had to go to a bar now i would have to have it amended that you can do that or you'd have to find one of these secret bars where you can do that but there are you know you have to really look for that here 

204.11 204.87 A: (( it's like a )) 

207.64 209.38 A: (( negative connotation )) 

208.00 212.27 B: and i that's why you know when i was listening well you know smoking yeah they're 

212.89 215.06 B: and also that's bad i know it's 

215.11 219.21 B: it does awful things to us but but at the same time 

219.60 220.53 A: (( with over )) 

220.26 225.52 B: [cough] it's a relaxant for me and i i mean i do know if i 

221.60 223.53 A: (( eating and that is )) 

225.92 229.12 B: if i ever develop lung cancer it will be my fault 

229.14 241.90 B: but um it's as relaxing to me as drinking coffee [laughter] and i will do that also and um you know but but listening to all those choices i thought but i would never 

230.14 231.20 A: (( kind )) 

241.94 243.13 B: over eat 

243.51 245.59 A: (( of what i i mean it's not true of )) 

245.91 248.79 B: and that thing because to m- well for me though 

248.95 252.66 B: i chose that as being the worst because um 

253.01 256.63 B: it tends to be when i'm in a bar smoking and drinking i tend 

256.67 257.43 B: to 

257.42 259.38 A: (( everyone but )) 

261.44 262.34 B: (( be )) 

263.09 264.16 B: (( gossiping )) 

263.66 274.86 A: (( it is it's the first flash idea that comes through in my mind it's actually bad conditioning you know because we as as this culture with t._v. showing us that and with movies and then just every everything's catered towards very slim people and people who are )) 

274.92 277.64 B: (( too [laughter] like i'm doing )) 

275.39 276.35 A: (( not overweight )) 

276.71 278.33 A: (( then that even conditions more )) 

278.16 279.11 B: (( all these )) 

278.80 279.85 A: (( whenever )) 

279.44 281.66 B: (( bad things already but the )) 

282.34 283.35 A: (( you )) 

282.87 283.85 B: over eating 

284.19 285.21 B: (( part i )) 

286.22 287.68 B: (( there is )) 

288.37 289.72 B: (( an immediate )) 

290.27 291.15 A: (( hear )) 

292.13 292.90 B: (( response )) 

293.30 294.26 B: (( to )) 

295.96 299.60 B: (( the body yeah it's like it's a )) 

300.40 301.67 B: (( negative yeah )) 

302.12 303.72 B: (( yeah yeah tall )) 

303.50 305.42 A: (( over eat it's bad it's bad )) 

303.80 305.10 B: (( and slim )) 

307.09 307.84 B: (( yeah )) 

308.48 315.67 B: and so i'm sure that has something to do with me even saying that because if we were in a culture that s- that 

309.72 310.60 A: yeah 

313.28 314.03 A: (( [laughter] )) 

315.73 322.27 B: did the same exact thing with smoking being very bad i don't i think i would have listed that first 

321.56 323.66 A: yeah that's true 

323.10 325.75 B: but in asia like my friends in 

325.92 333.40 B: here's one in in ghana i've friends that live in in africa and they are um they are professors of mine 

333.50 339.23 B: they believed that it was very very very bad to gossip [laughter] 

338.57 339.65 A: (( uh-huh they really like )) 

341.95 343.05 A: (( you shouldn't talk about )) 

342.41 344.98 B: and they would put that 

345.02 351.82 B: i guess th- they would see over eating as bad they would see smoking as bad not you know just like we do like there are bad things to each 

351.75 361.02 B: there are worse things for each um choice but they really felt that gossiping was over the over the limit you sh- you shouldn't even think about doing that 

358.14 359.35 A: (( your friends yeah )) 

361.10 362.44 B: and um 

362.83 367.94 B: so i think it's cultural i think if i grew up in ghana i would be different if i grew up 

368.11 371.37 B: in tibet where that too is a really bad thing 

371.09 372.10 A: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

371.65 374.77 B: i mean it's super bad it's so cultural though 

374.96 379.76 B: and yeah i mean i've friends in france and they eat all the time but 

379.79 387.16 B: they're not obese i don't know why that is but they don't see overeating i don't know let me thing 

381.35 382.40 A: yeah 

386.39 389.27 A: maybe because they take a long time to eat 

388.58 399.63 B: yeah it might be that th- they spend a lot of time over conversation and food and they do a lot of drinking though and they don't think drinking is bad because i mean a lot of my friends are from france or who have lived in france have said 

391.95 393.04 A: right 

399.76 410.33 B: you don't drink to excess that you get you know smashed but you can drink a lot if you're eating a lot it you just kind of a mix there's nothing bad about it you're enjoying the cuisine of a country 

403.20 404.35 A: right 

409.79 410.98 A: (( right )) 

410.39 422.33 B: well you come over back to new york or back to texas you're like well you know drinking that's bad and then people who don't drink start to think oh i had a g- i had two glasses of wine that's probably bad 

413.11 413.99 A: uh-huh 

421.71 431.00 A: yeah well you know i mean i've gone from from work after not having eaten all day long because i've been so busy and gone and had one 

429.24 430.15 B: mhm 

431.19 435.11 A: drink and just been totally you know drunk 

433.53 435.62 B: mhm mhm mhm 

435.27 446.53 A: you know and then i've had maybe um you know a good meal throughout the day gone out at nine or ten o'clock and had one beer and then like totally in control so 

445.77 446.76 B: mhm 

446.58 457.59 A: you know um but then i've gone to restaurants where i've eaten you know for three or four hours at a um there's a texas day brazil which is a um a 

447.48 449.56 B: right has to do about the food 

457.73 470.45 A: a um th you know the restaurant for brazil with that kind of meat and you sit there with your friends for three or four hours just talking and eating an- and taking breaks and and 

461.32 462.50 B: mhm 

470.61 472.65 A: (( all that kind )) 

472.67 473.79 A: (( of stuff )) 

473.62 475.16 B: right 

474.45 475.48 A: (( and )) 

476.46 479.02 A: (( you're you're not full )) 

479.24 480.34 B: mhm 

480.03 481.15 A: and 

481.41 483.63 A: (( you're not drunk and you're just you )) 

484.08 487.99 B: right [laughter] i think we're bad [laughter] 

486.98 488.26 A: (( know satisfied and )) 

488.20 489.28 B: (( oh )) 

488.54 494.41 A: (( so i i think it's a different style of eating here everything's fast food and fast drinking fast )) 

494.29 503.06 B: yeah i mean it it starts to become slander if you go into the professional sense and in that way it's really bad because there are there are federal um 

494.87 495.58 A: (( smoking )) 

498.17 498.81 A: (( [laughter] )) 

498.98 500.16 A: (( you ))

504.66 505.81 A: (( know )) 

505.70 508.92 B: but also then you start to think morally 

509.27 514.22 B: should you be you know i- is this what you want to pass onto other people that it's okay t- 

514.29 523.71 B: to really gossip about others i mean i do a little and i used to more so when i was in college because it just seemed to be my age 

523.38 524.28 A: (( so )) 

523.79 533.01 B: and um then it depended on the crowd that you were with i just happened to be a teacher and teachers gossip about everyone else it was awful but

542.36 543.89 A: (( gossip is )) 

544.97 545.81 A: (( bad )) 

546.27 556.06 B: yeah there's i mean the lines get blurred you don't know and often you don't just know oh we're gossiping it really starts off very innocent and um 

549.26 550.12 A: yeah 

555.98 569.28 B: it can really progress [laughter] it really can it can a- also change a tenor of a friendship so that if you find that all you do with this one friend is gossip about other people you have to really re-evaluate what kind of friendship is this is this just a gossiping 

558.14 559.02 A: yeah 

567.58 568.78 A: (( yeah but ))
