128.73 130.03 A: oh really 

129.45 138.65 B: yeah and that's uh upon getting the first sign of a cold that's what she takes and sends to us and that seems to work as well so 

138.01 139.65 A: oh really oh okay 

139.69 140.61 B: but uh 

139.72 143.68 A: wha- what is it a a vitamin pill or is it a 

143.08 145.34 B: it's it's almost like a um 

145.46 150.38 B: oh like a tum- like that type of uh thing you suck on it and it uh 

150.02 151.60 A: oh okay uh-huh 

151.15 155.07 B: but it has the zinc in it and that's supposed to work 

155.10 156.06 A: uh-huh 

155.98 166.04 B: and then my daughter on the east coast when colds come up there which they've had the winter snows she makes the homemade uh chicken soup and that 

162.03 162.95 A: uh-huh 

166.32 174.60 B: seems to be a a remedy that has always worked [laughter] yeah that helps for us too i i don't know chicken soup goes way back 

168.90 171.26 A: oh really [laughter] 

172.52 173.34 A: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

173.89 179.41 A: yes they say i haven't had any chicken soup in a while but i don't usually take it when i get sick either

183.18 193.72 B: i have i i if i've had a cold and it seems to persist i i've done that made up some uh homemade chicken soup and it seems to go away 

187.83 189.23 A: oh really uh-huh 

193.44 194.64 A: oh okay 

194.40 207.38 B: but um otherwise if i tell my mother and speak to her she'll send me the lozenges but for me it's always rest yeah it and and i've just uh if i feel i'm coming down with something i'll just go to bed early and uh 

198.30 199.13 A: uh-huh 

201.57 203.11 A: oh okay uh-huh 

207.63 211.24 B: uh sleep what i can and and mine seems to be go away 

211.01 218.19 A: uh-huh oh okay well i had a boss used to tell us to take um if you had a sore throat to um 

218.74 227.24 A: um lemon juice and vinegar lemon juice i'm sorry lemon juice and honey and you would you would boil that up in water 

223.88 224.92 B: oh 

227.34 230.15 A: and it would supposedly uh take away 

230.54 234.86 A: (( to cl- to clear your sore throat she was back from the depression era so )) 

230.56 231.89 B: how interesting 

234.74 235.85 B: sure 

235.01 235.86 A: uh 

236.12 237.13 A: i guess 

236.33 237.11 B: did 

237.33 243.48 B: do you believe what uh they asked us that uh that the seven days about the uh 

244.11 247.00 B: length for a cold to persist 

247.10 251.59 A: no i don't think it lasts that long usually i'd say like three or four days 

251.36 256.69 B: that's what i would say too i would say that something longer than that it's probably some form of a virus 

256.23 261.12 A: uh-huh yeah and then what about do you go to a doctor if you have a cold or 

260.75 262.27 B: no do you

269.13 270.59 B: [laughter] 

271.53 272.99 B: yeah what 

272.31 273.84 A: (( uh-huh 'cause they )) 

273.64 282.20 B: how what an interesting uh theme just to bring up on illness which uh i was just watching t._v. on the sars which is similar 

280.54 281.44 A: uh-huh 

282.47 285.92 B: not to the uh common cold but i guess more to the flu 

285.69 287.31 A: oh yeah uh-huh 

286.28 290.28 B: but it it is a form of illness but um 

290.59 297.14 B: it's said they had three symptoms and i guess that was having a temperature over a hundred and and um 

297.78 298.70 A: uh-huh 

298.11 300.55 B: god i can't remember what the other things were i guess 

299.64 301.49 A: oh really uh you 

300.60 305.29 B: the the body the body feeling real weak and tired and 

304.67 305.70 A: (( uh-huh )) 

305.79 306.62 A: (( well )) 

305.93 307.71 B: anyway i 

306.88 310.03 A: luck luck luckily it hasn't hit our country yet 

309.88 322.17 B: no no although they i was listening tonight and they said something about uh coachella there is a gentleman a young uh man in his twenties that had visited china but came back 

310.12 311.50 A: so yeah 

322.30 327.32 B: uh very ill and he's in quarantine in his own home for ten days 

326.75 329.72 A: oh really where's he live in in america 

327.62 331.54 B: mhm coachella coachella yeah in uh 

332.08 337.19 B: somewhere i guess past san diego down that way i i don't really know where coachella is 

334.69 336.53 A: oh really oh 

336.54 343.36 A: well no no they they say toronto's pretty bad and they were giving out warnings to the baseball players up there 

343.12 344.33 B: oh really 

343.64 356.01 A: about uh the about they said if you sign autographs make sure you have your your same um use your pen and don't use a pen from the fans 'cause of the contacts with the germs on the pen 

356.00 356.84 B: (( mm )) 

356.08 358.71 A: and um basically they 

359.22 366.97 A: i guess they're basically saying like in the airports to try and keep your mouth covered and stuff like that so you don't pick up germs that way 

366.91 367.71 B: (( mm )) 

367.40 373.31 A: and uh but i guess one of the ways to prevent a cold is to wash your hands like before you eat and everything 

373.19 375.93 B: yeah that's what they say wash your hands frequently 

373.50 374.41 A: and 

375.85 377.06 A: yeah 

376.01 378.20 B: uh is probably one of the best 

377.72 380.83 A: uh-huh and don't put your hands on your face 'cause 

380.73 381.91 B: yes 

381.00 385.41 A: that that's where they say like most of the germs are in the mouth and that 

384.15 388.06 B: yeah isn't that interesting they say don't touch your eyes or your mouth 

387.43 389.07 A: oh yeah 

388.53 395.50 B: yeah i i've heard that when you think of it that's our our whole system there with the nose the mouth and the uh 

395.36 396.26 A: uh-huh 

395.65 398.75 B: eyes it's all connected so why not 

398.31 400.09 A: yeah i know yeah 'cause 

400.25 404.64 A: 'cause i guess um once you touch if you have dirty hands and you 

405.00 408.55 A: touch your food and and everything then you eat the food it's in your body 

408.47 412.45 B: well sure when you think about it how much germs are on our hands what we touch 

412.08 413.08 A: uh-huh 

412.49 414.53 B: all day long you know 

414.25 422.00 A: no i know yeah like just different like even at work just papers that everybody passes around the office and things like that 

421.83 424.39 B: oh yeah definitely definitely 

423.09 424.12 A: uh-huh 

424.45 425.81 A: (( or that )) 

424.50 430.91 B: yeah or even if you go to the grocery store anywhere you go if you think about it you're touching things that other people have touched 

430.40 431.87 A: oh yeah uh-huh 

431.25 433.54 B: not that that's uh 

433.58 443.02 B: you know i'm not that kind of a a nut really i mean i just but i do wash my hands a lot i i work at a uh volunteering with cancer patients 

437.47 438.38 A: uh-huh 

442.68 444.34 A: oh okay yeah 

443.03 445.33 B: and they tell you to wash your hands 

445.64 447.46 B: very very often so 

447.06 448.89 A: uh-huh oh okay 

448.54 453.09 B: that's how to teach me anyway even more than i would normally do 

452.79 458.59 A: uh-huh yeah well my mother always told us when we were little to wash our hands all the time before we ate and everything 

458.33 459.46 B: mhm 

458.65 472.64 A: and that so i guess we basically washed them at least three times a day back then and um usually now i wash i got away from washing my hands before lunch for for a while but now i start i started doing it again 

472.31 473.87 B: oh that's good 

472.84 477.37 A: 'cause yeah 'cause well i work with a company called hemophilia health services 

477.12 478.23 B: oh 

477.44 480.01 A: and um one of the things i do as i touch 

480.36 481.30 A: um 

482.11 491.20 A: um medicine that people have sent back that's expired and stuff like that so it's been in their homes and everything so um so there's a lot of germs on that 

485.92 488.71 B: oh boy yes 

489.02 490.15 B: boy you 

490.62 492.12 B: you really do
