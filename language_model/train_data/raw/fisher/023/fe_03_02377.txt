197.45 201.48 B: yeah green tea's supposed to be i guess like the new miracle 

201.60 202.84 B: type thing 

202.53 206.50 A: yeah that's what i heard i i don't know i had some um 

206.50 210.55 A: tree tea the other day i went to this arbor day celebration 

210.48 212.84 A: and they had ah pine 

212.63 226.03 A: i forget what kind of t- it was the the tip of the ah tip of the leaves ah tea it was really good it was very light and and offered a a gentle taste 

225.82 235.16 A: but it was sort of the ul- ultimate natural kind of thing where you get it for free you just take the tips of these buds off the trees and you make your own tea 

234.91 235.68 B: (( mm )) 

235.42 246.31 A: but yeah i i don't know why i don't i have tea here and i bought it but i haven't had it you know i always have to have my coffee though and i 

246.26 252.85 A: i know i'm addicted to bad health give me give me ten hours without coffee and i'm starting to get headaches you know 

252.14 254.44 B: yeah well if i don't drink tea 

254.64 256.38 B: um i get headaches 

256.50 261.78 B: you know yeah if an- and i always used to think it was 

256.65 258.95 A: really 

262.09 266.24 B: you know well just a headache but then i started noticing um 

266.43 271.29 B: if i'm some place where i don't have access to c- i if i don't drink hot tea i drink iced tea 

271.32 276.43 B: and if i don't have access to it i do get headaches and drinking anything that's caffeinated does not help 

276.59 278.02 A: right 

277.05 278.62 B: so you know so 

279.38 284.16 B: i don't know i guess guess all of those choices i think everything is not you know 

284.72 287.74 B: how do you pick one that's that's the worst 

287.92 291.60 A: i don't know but like the exercise one 

292.16 304.30 A: that's the one i i think from w- my own personal notice is is the worst that that's had the strongest influence on me in terms of being able to do stuff 

304.36 310.94 A: because i i walk a lot i work with the census bureau and i walk around a lot knock on doors and stuff 

310.24 311.66 B: yeah 

311.24 315.70 A: and i i live in san francisco so we got a lot of hills here 

315.75 324.24 A: and boy i i won't even take some of these hills i just won't won't do it anymore and i know that's psychological 

324.21 337.89 A: but i also i i did a couple of months ago i did a i climbed up the side of this hill on a bunch of stairs and i was dying by the time i got up there so i think it's lack of exercise 

338.03 347.11 A: and and some of these are combining factors and then there's smoking is the one but all the doctors and then i've been talking to other patients 

341.49 342.67 B: yeah 

347.36 358.25 A: ah i talked to one guy he's in his early fifties and he had this artery in his neck that they cleaned out and it's unbelievable stuff i've been hearing 

357.77 358.95 B: yeah 

358.33 366.74 A: but they they cleaned out this article it was filled with something and that was one thing and then i met this other guy the other day 

366.66 372.89 A: he's got these arteries in his legs and they've been cleaning these out for a couple of years now 

372.71 383.86 A: and they even um they go in and just slice these things up and clean it all out and it collects back up and he's quit smoking because his doctor told him that it's worthless to keep doing this 

384.00 385.40 A: and um 

386.20 389.21 A: and and for him continue smoking so 

389.40 390.96 A: i don't know i 

390.95 402.23 A: i i think the exercise one for my own personal stand point but boy you know it you're right it's like whoa wait a minute each one is bad what were they smoking 

394.77 396.14 B: well yeah 

402.21 407.59 A: caffeine exercise and there were a couple more that i didn't hear 

406.85 412.04 B: yeah that's what i was trying to remember myself because those were the three that like stuck out 

412.38 413.99 B: um for me 

413.85 422.92 A: yeah we hear we hear wh what you's are doing or something i guess so we al- we both know that what we're doing is not the best of things right 

416.61 418.26 B: [laughter] 

421.66 423.71 B: right right 

423.93 426.14 A: do you exercise at all 

425.83 427.01 B: um 

427.02 430.14 B: not on a regular basis no but um 

430.21 432.39 B: i work in in a hotel 

432.60 434.82 B: um so i'm constantly 

435.29 446.30 B: running um all night long you know like t- back and forth to rooms and stuff so that's probably about the most exercise and i guess that i live on on a second floor in a second floor apartment 

436.70 437.39 A: (( oh )) 

446.40 447.77 B: so 

448.18 456.86 B: you know several trips up and down the steps some days but i don't know i just never was one i like to walk ah i work third shift though 

456.99 458.18 B: um 

458.85 461.24 B: so i find myself like you know sleeping 

461.47 465.06 B: during the day time when i should be out exercising or doing something 

463.51 472.73 A: really i try and walk t- i try and walk to the store and like i say my job takes me around where i walk a bit 

465.40 466.77 B: you know so 

471.24 478.13 B: that's that's good you know and i don't you know and i don't think when people say exercise i don't necessarily think it has to be 

473.41 475.34 A: yeah 

479.11 485.08 B: some kind of regiment i mean even like you know with your job you said you walk so that that's exercise 

485.19 495.07 A: yeah but you know i tell you i can really tell the difference by not riding my bike i i could ride my bike for a couple of hours and boy i tell you i feel really good i 

495.02 509.57 A: i s- i i just dr- ride my bike and spit up all this gunk and garbage and stuff and after about two hours man you talk about feeling good man i you know and those cigarettes they they just are so delicious after a couple of hours of riding a bike 

508.77 509.81 B: [laughter] 

509.47 515.21 A: you would not believe you know [laughter] 

512.10 519.10 B: yeah i would believe it yeah i would honestly i would because i think when my daughter was younger and you know 

519.25 521.44 B: was doing a lot more with her 

521.54 522.68 B: um 

522.86 527.99 B: you know yeah i didn't smoke as much now she's twenty and 

528.60 535.86 B: you know i ca- she doesn't want to go to the park with me to play on the swings any more [laughter] i don't know why but you know 

532.34 537.64 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

536.03 541.18 B: so you know yeah i mean i used to get a lot more exercise then than i do now and i realize this 

541.37 544.11 B: and i'm trying not to be a cough potato but 

544.88 547.09 B: (( sometimes it's difficult yeah yeah it's the motiv- and )) 

547.00 548.37 A: (( and )) 

550.36 551.67 B: (( then you keep smoking more cigarettes )) 

551.58 564.55 A: you go light o- i'll light one right after another and then you probably have to have a cup of tea in between your forth or fifth one right yeah i have to have a cup of coffee between my forth and fifth one 

554.75 555.78 B: (( right yeah )) 

557.53 558.41 B: yeah 

559.57 560.77 B: right 

563.46 565.32 B: [laughter] 

564.83 575.26 A: because the taste is weird and yeah so i i guess we- what we're really saying is is the smoking is the one then isn't it 

567.81 569.62 B: (( yeah )) 

573.59 582.32 B: i think yeah i think that's okay let's put that at the top of the list that's like got to be worst and then followed up by exercer- you know not exercising 

583.08 585.05 A: yeah 

583.80 587.94 B: and the caffeine like there's so much caffeine in everything any more 

588.00 589.51 B: because if you have you know 

588.24 591.13 A: well i don't drink sodas do you drink sodas 

590.41 595.94 B: very very rarely um you know and if i do it's usually some- you know 

592.40 593.65 A: yeah 

597.14 599.89 B: um something that doesn't have caffeine in it like
