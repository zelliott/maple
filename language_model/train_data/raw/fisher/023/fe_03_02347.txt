0.37 1.56 B: angela 

1.05 2.90 A: hi jim 

2.47 3.67 B: (( jim hi jim i'm )) 

3.12 4.52 A: hi how are ya 

4.09 5.66 B: pretty swell how are you today 

4.97 7.03 A: pretty well pretty well 

7.11 9.04 A: um interesting topic 

8.68 14.27 B: [laughter] yeah so gossiping smoking alcohol uh what was it overeating 

13.36 14.74 A: overeating 

14.46 16.56 B: or not exercising enough 

16.07 20.53 A: right i don't think so think that's it 

16.88 18.22 B: am i missing one 

20.84 24.56 B: well i i don't know these are all pretty bad habits [laughter] 

23.77 27.95 A: yeah yeah i guess i g- the first thing that struck me um 

28.06 29.90 A: would be that um 

30.31 35.20 A: from you b- m- my my sort of personal takeout would be gossiping would be the worst because it sort of 

35.30 42.06 A: involves more than just yourself somehow i i m- i mean it's you know f- for me if someone is going to chose to 

38.52 39.45 B: (( oh yes )) 

42.05 53.19 A: overeat or to drink too much or drink caffeine too much i think was one of them or over- whatever they were not exercise it's sort of it's sort of like a more personal decision i guess you know um whether or not 

48.23 50.06 B: (( inflicting upon yourself )) 

50.90 51.85 B: yeah 

53.09 61.38 A: um i would chose any one of those er um excessive uh behaviors but gossiping it's sort of it's sort of um 

61.83 72.77 A: [lipsmack] it seems to be mean spirited generally um and it sort of seems to involve yourself in someone else's business i think 

72.05 79.34 B: i would definitely say gossiping is pretty bad but i don't know i kind of lean towards the alcohol [cough] only because i guess alcohol is legal 

76.34 77.19 A: (( mm )) 

79.34 80.50 A: right 

79.85 90.54 B: and you know i mean smoking is legal but you see a lot of anti smoking ads but alcohol is legal and it's kind of uh you know i have a lot of friends who are alcoholics to say the least 

89.97 92.19 A: right right 

90.71 97.31 B: and uh to think that you know i guess driving drunk would come into play if you think about other people but uh 

94.13 99.01 A: [laughter] [laughter] i guess that's true that's true i was 

98.14 112.84 B: the fact that it's legal but everybody seems to do it you know [laughter] well caffeine is the same way though you see that would almost make me think caffeine's worse now that i think about it [laughter] just because caffeine is really really bad for you and that's there's no a- you know no campaigns against drinking coffee 

101.07 101.84 A: (( mm )) 

110.57 111.35 A: (( mm )) 

112.56 113.91 A: right 

113.27 117.68 B: and uh we all know starbucks is going to dominate some time soon [laughter] 

116.72 118.28 A: (( [laughter] )) 

118.16 118.84 B: so 

118.94 119.78 B: (( [cough] )) 

119.73 121.60 A: mm that's true that's 

120.22 120.86 B: i 

120.88 124.23 B: although i don't know i kinda see your point on gossiping [cough] 

124.26 128.54 A: but i guess i guess you know i was sort of seeing how it related how how it sort of 

128.43 140.42 A: uh would affect just an individual as opposed to how each of those um things does impact on society as a you know a- as a whole and actually i suppose each one of them if you sort of you know 

140.97 143.01 A: really look at it like even um 

143.24 155.70 A: overeating i suppose could lead to you know health problems and so it's you're you'd be a greater burden on society if you have health problems and the same with alcohol you know as you were saying drunk driving and of course alcohol 

155.49 158.99 A: in many forms affects all of society um 

159.04 161.81 A: wow [laughter] it's more of a dilemma than our thought 

159.87 161.16 B: [laughter] 

161.33 163.87 B: i guess excessive in general is bad [laughter] 

163.06 164.93 A: well yeah yeah 

164.11 171.32 B: i mean if you excessively drink too many o'dooles non alcoholic beer then you've you know could be excessively a non alcoholic i don't know 

170.91 173.21 A: (( [laughter] i don't know yeah )) 

172.60 185.16 B: um [cough] i don't know i guess if we have to lean towards one more so than the other there i'd have to think about it uh not exercising how could that be worse than alcohol i i don't i can't see that being my my number one choice at all um 

183.20 183.90 A: (( n- )) 

184.14 194.26 A: n- no no um yeah yeah i guess uh if we look at it in terms of which of those behaviors um 

194.58 205.86 A: sort of um well th- there's either which one of these could be most addictive or which of them could sort of uh change you as a person than most i i guess alcohol'd probably 

205.97 211.00 A: be pretty much up there not that that's the issue [laughter] um 

209.41 210.32 B: yeah 

210.35 213.17 B: and alcohol is definitely i think it's so available 

212.93 214.55 A: mhm 

213.32 227.31 B: you know and i mean you start you know it's a social thing it's a social thing and everybody wants to socialize everybody wants to have friends and a lot of times that involves going to bars or going some- you know even dinner where you have wine it might start off as that and then you drink a little bit more 

227.26 234.65 B: and it's like in in especially in a lot of careers like a lot of jobs the the big thing is to drink afterwards to have happy hour after work 

234.64 239.68 B: you know even i've worked at places where they've promoted alcohol drinking [laughter] 

238.62 240.19 A: mhm mhm 

239.55 250.37 B: and it you know evidently though there's no serious campaigns against it and yet everybody sits at work tapping their finger waiting for the hour of happy hour to come up [laughter] 

249.40 251.29 A: right right 

250.67 259.11 B: um and then they of course the next day is always really bad for them i i think it's a personal habit and and it's harder to say no to i think too because it's so available 

259.56 265.39 A: right and like like you said y- c- y- um as a personal habit that only sort of affects yourself 

266.16 269.18 A: i don't know it's sort of i guess it's sort of hard to look at it um 

267.41 267.97 B: (( [cough] )) 

269.82 272.33 A: in sort of a a a um 

272.42 274.92 A: isolated manner i suppose 

273.73 274.65 B: yeah 

274.98 280.23 B: i think i think if it was more personal and you asked yourself which one was probably 

280.92 290.62 B: you know one of the worst for yourself i would guess and not inflicting on other people would definitely be not exercising because how could you not exercising really affect a large cod of people 

290.29 292.65 A: right right right 

290.93 291.77 B: (( you know )) 

292.01 299.56 B: um versus if you're drunk and belligerent [laughter] and you're on the street and you're yelling at somebody or you know if you're [cough] 

295.33 296.46 A: [laughter] 

297.27 298.24 A: mhm 

299.69 309.79 B: i g- guess i don't lean towards smoking 'cause i reason although it has health problems it's it's your health you know and although we have their second hand smoke you know that person chose to be in that environment 

309.63 321.62 A: right right well indeed and that's sort of a big thing right now i'm i'm in new york and right now um a law has just been passed in all the bars and restaurants uh no smoking right no smoke at all 

310.57 311.46 B: so 

318.88 329.73 B: no smoking inside right yeah i just moved to new york i i i thought that was strange [laughter] i mean it's good but y- you still make a choice i guess to be outside talking with your friends who smoke you know i have friends who smoke 

323.58 324.34 A: (( mm )) 

329.20 330.81 A: mhm 

329.81 335.35 B: um on occasion i'll smoke a cigarette but it i don't not in excess but i can't see that being 

335.39 337.10 B: i can't see that being the worst although 

337.82 341.03 B: [cough] overeating there seems like there is one we missed too 

340.54 342.65 A: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

341.73 343.35 B: well i know there is caffeine 

343.77 345.95 B: uh excessive caffeine use 

345.99 347.60 B: how can that be 

347.91 349.35 B: a really bad 

349.51 355.13 B: i mean obviously on your budget if you're a starbucks addict like i am then then you definitely would be [laughter] 

354.39 360.06 A: yeah i think we can probably if if if we can sort of like rule some of these out i would say caffeine probably 

357.91 359.33 B: yeah exactly 

359.59 364.77 B: yeah so we c- we could take out caffeine possibly not exercising at least i would [cough] 

364.05 377.83 A: yeah in terms of sh- well i guess a- again like as as you say if it's in terms of just uh how it relates to yourself um it can't hurt any other people probably i mean it's unlikely um 

375.41 376.29 B: yeah 

376.85 389.92 B: and generally who decides the worst is what the general population right and if you're if you're trying to determine something that is overall most popular whether it's most popular for or most popular against it's a mass majority 

389.50 390.63 A: mhm 

390.00 400.16 B: and so if something's affecting only that person the likelihood of the mass majority agreeing on that being the worst is slim to nothing if you're um you know we're more concerned about ourselves [laughter] 

396.08 397.42 A: right 

398.98 400.53 A: sure sure 

400.37 405.93 B: so i i see i'm crossing 'em out here um smoking 

406.04 409.27 A: oh you're taking notes that's good [laughter] you actually wrote them down 

407.32 412.65 B: [laughter] well yeah it helps me 'cause they said it so fast i was like huh i'd better write these down real quick 

410.90 413.59 A: (( [sigh] [laughter] )) 

412.79 415.65 B: uh overeating i i wouldn't lean towards i'm i'm 

415.66 423.31 B: i'm kinda between gossiping and alcohol because you made such a good point in the beginning about gossiping and gossiping is also kind of a maybe a disorder 

423.36 425.31 B: that's not a choice you make 

425.64 433.19 B: you know some people gossip exc- really excessively and it's not by choice it's not like when you say oh i'm gonna go out and have a drink you just find yourself gossiping 

425.95 426.71 A: that's 

433.46 447.34 A: but that's sort of i i think y- you don't make a conscious choice but but it's sort of probably s- a a habit that's been developed and it's just part of your your life i mean i think you know there's certain people that that's sort of how they function on a on a normal basis i suppose 

442.16 443.38 B: exactly 

446.85 452.14 B: yeah and and there's rehab for alcohol right is there rehab for gossiping [laughter] 

449.17 453.35 A: [laughter] right [laughter] i don't know of any 

452.96 455.70 B: so you you have like uh almost a personal 

455.53 468.68 B: disorder that you've allowed yourself to become a habit and that's gossiping and if you realise that you gossip too much and you find yourself gossiping before you even think about the fact that your mouth is moving and words are coming out you're talking smack about somebody else 

468.66 474.85 B: then uh you know what do you do who do you go turn to you say mum i i have a gossiping problem [laughter] 

472.21 475.16 A: [laughter] in a way it's 

475.47 480.28 A: more um pervasive in a way because it's not actually recognized i suppose as 

480.79 482.68 A: an ill in a way 

481.71 489.79 B: yeah al- almost like i was kinda trying to say about caffeine like there's no like people don't really look at it but gossiping's even more kind of under the covers 

489.36 491.45 A: (( mm mhm )) 

490.03 495.92 B: um so yeah it's a close toss up for me what do you think between gossiping or alcohol excessive alcohol drinking 

493.26 495.47 A: (( mhm mm )) 

495.77 498.52 A: i think i'd have to i'd have to probably 

498.80 501.31 A: rehear ex- the exact phrasing of 

501.61 506.25 A: the um the question sort of put to us uh but it's sort of um 

506.81 510.34 B: i think which do we think is the worst i think out of out of personal habit 

510.48 512.14 A: out of personal okay 

510.60 512.73 B: which do we think is the worst 

512.90 516.44 A: what do we think are the worst as a personal habits um 

516.75 518.21 A: well i think i mean 

518.62 527.45 A: it it would have to sort of probably be excessive alcohol i would think i mean i- in terms of i- i- having the the the the most impact i suppose 

526.33 530.16 B: impact yeah because alcohol affects your budget it affects your health 

530.12 537.00 B: [cough] you know i've seen a lot of ads about how it affects your health and your heart size um you know it affects the people around you 

536.91 547.04 B: um it could affect people that you don't even know if you're driving drunk which a lot of people do and i even know somebody who you know been involved in that situation it's bad you know if you don't wanna 

540.42 542.22 A: right 

545.77 548.04 A: (( mm mhm )) 

547.35 554.34 B: hurt somebody you don't know much less hurt the people you do know or even yourself which at the point you probably have no control over whether or not you're hurting yourself 

554.67 560.30 A: and especially when when we look at it in terms of excessive for any one of these habits if it's really excessive then 

555.25 555.82 B: (( [cough] )) 

557.46 558.20 B: ex- 

559.54 572.78 B: if it's really excessive then alcohol would definitely turn into some of those things because excessive doesn't come along with [cough] she got really drunk but she was completely okay she didn't bother anybody she didn't drive drunk i wouldn't consider that excessive i would consider excessive like she got sick 

560.93 562.18 A: yeah 

562.96 564.01 A: yeah 

568.06 569.15 A: (( [laughter] )) 

570.26 571.55 A: right 

572.69 579.37 B: you know she got in the cab and yelled at the cab driver or she caused a scene on the street or ran over somebody [laughter] you 

578.79 588.82 A: right right and i suppose uh again again it's sort of a a question of i- if we're including um the effects on society as a whole because i suppose 

579.44 580.04 B: (( know )) 

580.30 581.15 B: (( so that's )) 

589.03 599.95 A: real excessive smoking or if you're smoking three packs a day you're gonna kill yourself with lung cancer pretty quickly i suppose um but then then again it's not going to affect society as a whole as 

594.09 595.14 B: true 

598.79 599.85 B: yeah
