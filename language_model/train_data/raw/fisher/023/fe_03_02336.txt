155.67 167.45 B: i had a friend said california was like a controlled terrarium because they were from the east coast [laughter] get the real seasons we just don't we just have one season throughout the year

167.21 168.33 A: yeah 

167.53 172.28 B: [sigh] but illness what else can we talk about illness crystal hm 

171.13 172.69 A: (( oh let's see )) 

172.88 177.78 B: let's see [sigh] do you know anyone who constantly gets ill 

178.13 185.68 A: oh well you know i have a friend at work and he's always getting sick and if anybody else is sick he gets it 

180.93 181.81 B: mhm 

182.91 184.26 B: oh 

185.52 189.45 B: mhm so how does that affect his attitude 

189.87 192.42 A: oh well you know he's just always 

191.89 194.13 B: (( [laughter] )) 

192.46 197.46 A: you know honking and spitting all the time and i'm saying god would you knock that off but 

194.24 198.82 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

198.16 202.71 A: but then that's when i start you know i ta- i take the echinacea and golden seal and zinc 

203.08 206.65 B: that's i i just drink a lot of water myself and take vitamins 

204.14 205.19 A: and 

205.25 206.40 A: yeah 

206.41 214.01 A: yeah but somebody at another job told me to do that you know when everyone else is getting sick take that and it'll help you from getting sick 

211.96 213.43 B: mhm 

214.17 218.19 A: and i've done that and it seems to work most of the time 

214.35 216.61 B: that's great 

218.35 222.06 B: that's great i'm glad thanks for the hot tip 

221.33 226.48 A: yeah you know i mean it's natural and stuff kinda like you know homeopathic and 

223.87 225.33 B: mhm 

226.12 229.44 B: yes i think those are the best remedies anyway 

227.83 236.15 A: yeah rather than like going to the doctor 'cause you know i have a lot of people that i know they oh i'm gonna go get my flu shot and then they get the flu anyway 

234.03 235.36 B: [laughter] 

235.94 238.98 B: exactly because they're giving you flu in the shot 

238.70 243.59 A: yeah or there's so many different strains of flu and cold viruses 

243.35 245.20 B: mhm [laughter] 

243.73 250.30 A: but you're only getting one strain of virus so if somebody else comes along with a different strain and you're gonna get that anyway 

250.41 255.49 B: exactly i just think one should be happy throughout one's life i know it's difficult sometimes 

253.63 254.60 A: [laughter] 

255.42 269.41 B: then you know one will not get ill so the one of the other questions was uh ta- it takes seven days to get rid of a cold and then something about going to the doctor hm or longer if you go to a doctor do you agree with that 

269.76 274.30 A: um i don't i i never go to the doctor if i for a cold or a flu 

270.48 272.34 B: [laughter] 

274.15 277.16 B: (( i don't either we have something in common )) 

275.47 277.92 A: i mean what are they gonna do you know 

277.93 280.26 B: they're gonna charge you for it crystal 

279.32 284.94 A: yeah they're gonna charge you an arm and a leg just to say oh you've got a cold that you already know 

281.41 282.73 B: (( [laughter] )) 

284.97 286.97 B: exactly 

285.12 289.15 A: and then they're gonna say well get lots of fluids rest 

288.77 289.86 B: mhm 

289.45 292.11 A: ah you know take some vitamins 

290.74 291.84 B: and doc- 

292.13 294.26 A: [laughter] 

292.75 297.19 B: [laughter] doctors are just mechanics anyway they can only go on what you tell them 

296.65 299.32 A: yeah take some tylenol for your fever 

297.55 298.79 B: [laughter] 

300.44 314.51 B: exactly so it really doesn't matter i knew a hyp- i i knew a hypochondriac once and the reason she was a sick all the time was because she had such a negative attitude about life and her career et cetera et cetera 

302.95 304.25 A: yeah 

312.75 317.21 A: yeah well being hypochondriac it's kinda psychosomatic too 

317.38 320.77 B: yes [laughter] 

317.91 324.48 A: you know you'll bring it on yourself because you think you're sick so you get sick and you get these symptoms 'cause you're thinking that you are 

324.52 327.04 B: it's true it's absolutely true 

325.53 331.10 A: yeah i have a girlfriend that's a hypochondriac and she's always thinking there's something wrong with her 

328.80 330.44 B: [laughter] 

330.81 337.83 B: [laughter] really [laughter] i know those people always seem to be the people who are sick 

331.80 333.39 A: [laughter] 

337.22 338.33 A: yeah 

338.24 346.02 B: it never fails [laughter] so after the phone calls what do we do crystal i mean after they tell us 

344.68 351.30 A: oh after after nine and a half minutes it'll tell us that we have thirty seconds left to say goodbye and all that 

347.35 348.93 B: mhm 

351.26 353.43 B: oh i see okay 

352.38 355.20 A: and then afterwards if we want 

355.32 360.32 A: to leave a recorded like comment on on whatever we can do that 

359.38 360.28 B: mhm 

360.45 362.76 B: have you left any comments so far 

362.24 368.21 A: no not really i mean it was enough just trying to think what to say to a stranger for ten minutes [laughter] 

363.83 364.85 B: okay 

366.44 374.46 B: [laughter] yeah they should give us a choice of topics to cover i think 

369.23 370.09 A: (( so )) 

373.20 380.34 A: that's what i thought at the very beginning 'cause they gave all these different topics and i thought oh well i can talk about this and this and that and 

379.23 381.25 B: [laughter] 

380.31 391.92 A: and then one time they came on and they you know talking about something and like at least they tell ya at the beginning what the topic is and then if it's if i know i have nothing to say then i i hang up 

382.30 383.18 B: (( [laughter] )) 

387.94 389.58 B: mhm 

390.48 394.49 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] oh that's ))
