0.12 1.31 A: hello 

0.77 1.94 B: hello 

1.94 3.47 A: hi i'm lisa 

3.06 4.21 B: i'm karen 

4.09 7.33 A: hi i didn't even hear the second question they asked did you 

7.14 9.40 B: um i think it said 

9.46 11.81 B: um when the uh 

12.11 15.10 B: when the seasons change people get sick do you 

14.96 15.96 A: mhm 

15.43 17.50 B: and then it said um 

18.24 21.92 B: uh there's a saying the saying one you didn't hear 

21.70 23.04 A: yeah the second one 

22.32 27.38 B: okay um if there's a saying there's a saying that a last a cold lasts 

27.63 31.91 B: um seven days if you don't go to a doctor and a week if you do do you agree 

31.26 36.29 A: [laughter] i would have to say yes 

32.09 33.25 B: [laughter] 

35.23 38.82 B: [laughter] i find that rather funny 

37.51 38.48 A: you know 

39.47 41.69 B: so do you get sick when the seasons change 

42.06 54.86 A: not really but i do have um sinus drainage but i think that comes from just having allergies and when the seasons change there tends to be like more pollen in the air and grass and i'll get sniffly and stuff like that 

54.45 60.93 B: right same here i never really get sick because of the season change i rarely never find myself to have a cold 

61.39 63.73 A: right well that's good 

61.94 68.57 B: other than that yeah i i find that fine so i never have to go to the doctor so i never know how long it lasts [laughter] 

68.33 69.67 A: where do you live 

69.41 71.09 B: in new york where do you live 

70.83 72.03 A: in new york 

71.66 72.67 B: (( oh yeah )) 

72.40 73.83 A: that's strange 

73.12 75.23 B: yeah 

74.91 76.16 A: no um 

76.23 86.74 A: i don't really think you can get sick for a seasonal change um i don't even didn't get sick when weather changes i think a lot of people say that but i i don't really see how it can be true per se 

83.55 84.47 B: right 

86.34 93.39 B: no i just think that possibly when um the cold air gets warmer a germ lasts longer 

94.05 95.51 A: oh that makes sense 

95.03 96.91 B: so um 

97.52 99.63 B: you know it has to come from a germ 

99.74 100.93 A: mhm 

99.93 105.02 B: it doesn't come from like the doctors always say you don't catch a cold because you go outside without a hat on 

105.36 106.34 A: mhm 

106.09 108.30 B: so i you know it's 

108.33 115.45 B: i i don't i agree with you that i don't think you can get sick because the weather per se if you go outside without a jacket or whatever 

115.57 118.52 B: but because germs last longer in warmer weather 

119.43 120.42 B: um 

120.45 121.87 B: that's probably 

122.35 123.27 B: (( you know )) 

123.62 125.58 B: how how one gets sick 

125.86 129.50 A: so what do you do to prevent illness i think was the other question 

128.46 129.84 B: oh yeah that's right 

130.90 132.70 B: i don't really have to do anything 

133.29 136.79 B: you know i just um you know i eat healthily 

136.87 138.88 B: and uh you know i 

139.32 143.23 B: just go along what i do you know i don't even think about it how about you 

142.51 143.37 A: right 

143.61 158.54 A: i think i only really get sick like once a year um i stay fairly healthy to uh eat well like you said and you know exercise and try to maintain like a positive attitude and i think that usually keeps me from being um sick 

146.04 146.98 B: mhm 

149.45 150.86 B: mhm 

158.14 159.37 B: exactly 

158.44 166.93 A: and then and then once a year you know it's just kind of natural from living in new york we're exposed to a lot of toxins and and you know 

164.88 165.84 B: right 

167.51 180.60 A: i don't know bad things in the air i guess with so many people living here in such a small space that your body eventually will will have to release the toxins and like i visit the doctor and he's like you were here last year this exact day with the exact same problem 

179.77 180.59 B: (( oh yes )) 

181.03 190.57 A: and he's like it's just natural your body just builds up toxins and you have to release them no matter how healthy you are or how many precautions you take to not get sick this will eventually happen 

190.12 194.65 B: exactly when you when you get worn you know worn down that's when you feel the most you know 

194.73 198.26 B: that's when you're most susceptible so you just have to make sure that you get a lot of rest 

198.57 199.92 A: mhm 

198.57 201.69 B: and um you know just keep your body 

201.98 207.20 B: not from not getting tired and you don't you don't ever really feel like if you do even catch a little cold 

207.21 214.89 A: yeah and that's true because if i run myself ragged and i'm going out a lot and not sleeping right or not eating right or drinking too much 

214.29 216.26 B: exactly exact 

215.27 222.84 A: then i think i'm more susceptible to getting sick and i'm slugging and trying to do too much and eventually i'll just like break down and be sick 

221.70 225.71 B: yes it's hard to get out of that it's hard to get out of the rut when you get into it 

225.69 226.84 A: that's true 

226.45 230.64 B: yeah i feel like ten minutes has already gone [laughter] 

230.71 232.13 A: you feel like what 

231.60 232.56 B: [laughter] 

232.77 242.39 B: no but i that that you know that's just that you know if you don't if you just take care of yourself then you know most likely you won't get sick and if you do it's not going to be anything more than you know 

242.44 245.99 B: just a little cold due to just normal you know every day 

244.91 246.00 A: mhm 

246.69 251.50 A: and my friends that are chronically sick seem to be the ones that are malnourished and 

251.25 252.22 B: right 

251.42 254.17 A: don't sleep on a regular basis so they never 

254.12 267.40 A: go to bed the same time they may live on four hours of sleep and think they're okay and you know have a liquid lunch and a liquid dinner and not eat right and i'm like why are you always pale and sick and sniffly and you know 

259.87 261.69 B: right exactly 

266.15 268.66 B: well that's because they don't take care of themselves 

268.43 277.82 A: exactly so i think i i think health if you try to maintain a certain level of health and your body runs more efficiently and you won't get as sick 

272.77 273.57 B: yeah 

277.26 281.73 B: exactly and if you don't have time to get sick i don't i never i don't have time to get sick 

281.55 284.50 A: you know no one does living in this city 

282.47 283.31 B: (( so )) 

284.11 295.55 B: right so it you know just if you don't have time you just don't let your body you know if you don't feel well you know you take a little while and that's really all you have to recover so you just can't you can't um 

292.29 293.37 A: mhm 

295.70 301.14 A: and it's like i try not to go to the doctor because you he's just going to tell me what i already know 

295.82 296.95 B: can't let yourself 

300.60 301.63 B: exactly 

301.63 310.66 A: and you know you might get some penicillin you almost feel like there should be like a delivery service for penicillin instead of paying the doctor fees and the prescrip- 

304.02 305.14 B: right 

309.01 311.14 B: let me tell you it should be sold over the counter 

310.95 312.91 A: exactly and it's like 

311.56 312.61 B: [laughter] 

313.27 318.88 A: you they tell you to take it for a week and if you didn't go to him you'd probably be well in a week anyways you know 

318.09 321.67 B: exactly well that was that that's the saying they just said on the 

321.90 324.97 B: on the recording that if you go to the doctor [laughter] 

325.19 329.11 A: it'll take the same time or it'll take a week or as if you don't go to the doctor 

328.35 331.64 B: exactly i mean a cold is a cold you can't you know 

332.12 334.86 B: can't really do anything about a cold just to let it go away 

334.93 335.92 A: mhm 

335.04 337.00 B: get rest and you know 

337.24 339.35 B: drink some fluids [laughter] 

339.06 352.49 A: but it is pretty crazy like when i've worked in an office environment one person gets sick everybody tends to get sick and it's like or are people not like washing their hands are they not like covering their mouth when they or their nose when they sneeze like how does that happen 

344.19 346.09 B: oh yeah it breeds yeah 

351.12 355.86 B: yeah yeah well that's what ha- that's the problem you know germs are airborne 

356.12 357.06 B: so 

357.35 361.14 B: if if somebody is sick you know you're bound to get it if you're in the same 

361.47 364.55 B: you know especially living with you know two kids 

361.87 362.99 A: vicinity 

364.89 373.86 B: and a husband we just went through getting sick and i i'm the only one who didn't get sick so you know it it's really you know you could keep everything clean but it's you know 

367.41 368.36 A: oh 

373.91 375.58 B: you touch one thing 

376.21 378.51 B: you know and you you have a germ 

378.33 379.39 A: mhm 

378.92 380.33 B: so it's uh 

381.10 388.49 B: you know it it's it's inevitable sometimes but as long as you you take care of yourself and you eat right and sleep well 

389.40 392.94 B: and you know and it you know everything should be fine 

392.97 394.26 A: yeah i agree 

394.81 399.69 A: it has to be hard to have two kids that get sick and then you don't end up getting it that's pretty lucky 

399.26 401.94 B: yeah my husband got it too so it uh 

402.26 404.63 B: (( you know three babies i guess )) 

404.91 406.52 A: [laughter] 

405.51 412.27 B: [laughter] um you know so it's yeah well it's hard because you know i had to take care you know when i take care of them it you know 

412.92 421.17 B: but usually usually adults don't get most things that children you know get these days strep throat ear infections 

420.84 421.93 A: mhm 

421.35 426.92 B: you know just a lot of common colds that you know and that kids can't really handle as well 

426.96 430.31 A: right their immune systems not as strong i guess as ours are 

428.20 429.67 B: exactly so 

429.84 431.47 B: exactly so 

431.61 437.77 B: you know but they snapped right out of it so it's you know that's like you know sometimes you get sick and you take care of everything else so 

438.20 440.24 A: are they in school do they get it 

440.27 444.56 B: yeah nursery school so you know they they bring home a germ and everybody has it so it's 

444.98 450.35 B: you know just there's nothing you could do about it well you know you could keep them away from people but you know what you 

445.05 446.36 A: right 

450.51 455.60 B: you either spend your whole life in a bubble or you deal with getting sick every once in a while so 

453.83 455.00 A: [laughter] 

455.52 458.02 A: and i think most of us would rather deal with the latter 

457.76 460.94 B: exactly exactly so 

462.14 463.17 B: what else 

463.62 465.38 A: yeah i wonder how long we've talked 

464.95 467.59 B: i don't know i don't a timer on my phone 

467.98 469.12 A: um 

468.79 470.08 B: [laughter] 

469.25 473.40 A: mine says twelve thirty three but i know i was on hold for a while so i'm not sure 

473.55 474.65 B: oh right 

473.73 476.50 A: how long because they were looking for another person 

475.81 477.21 B: right right 

478.29 479.01 A: (( mm )) 

478.99 480.04 B: (( i don't know )) 

479.12 482.05 A: what else did they ask us talk talk to talk about 

481.49 482.43 B: what 

483.42 485.02 A: i think that's about it right 

484.72 487.72 B: well yeah i think we've covered all i think three topics 

487.97 491.08 A: yeah i don't know what else i could say about illnesses really 

490.68 496.80 B: me either [laughter] so we could just say la la la until they i mean i i know have you ever done one of these before 

496.85 499.74 A: i did one yester- one yesterday 

497.14 498.34 B: this your first one 

499.30 500.07 B: (( oh )) 

500.17 503.38 A: but they have phoned me three times in the last twenty four hours 

502.84 504.08 B: really 

503.72 504.70 A: yeah 

505.52 506.93 A: so that's a lot 

506.39 509.77 B: yeah they called me yesterday but i guess the other person wasn't interested 

510.25 510.96 A: (( mm )) 

510.72 513.22 B: so they hung up 

512.60 515.05 A: yeah yesterday the one i did was on food 

515.19 516.56 B: oh that's funny 

515.19 519.16 A: and if i'd rather eat cook at home or eat out so that was pretty fun 

516.60 517.46 B: i guess 

518.03 519.08 B: (( oh yeah )) 

519.20 523.72 B: yeah that's funny because that's the one i got they must just do like one topic a day 

524.09 525.98 A: yeah that's probably what it is 

526.92 528.74 A: mm so is this your first one 

528.49 529.25 B: yes 

529.98 535.59 A: it's not bad i mean it's ten minutes is quite fast but like the illness one it's like i don't know if they want 

530.82 531.85 B: (( no )) 

534.42 538.35 B: there's really not much to talk about it as far as illness i mean do you get sick no 

538.41 539.45 A: yeah 

538.69 540.67 B: go to the doctor yes [laughter] 

540.65 546.58 A: unless they want to know about like chronic illnesses or like if any of our family members suffer but they didn't really say that 

545.93 549.03 B: no they i think they were just basically talking about a cold 

549.18 550.11 A: right 

549.71 550.70 B: um 

550.98 553.61 B: but other than sinuses i think that 

553.78 556.04 B: both of us don't get sick so 

556.45 557.18 A: (( uh-uh )) 

557.08 558.92 B: (( [laughter] so i'd have to say )) 

557.98 563.20 A: i don't know how we all manage to stay so healthy in new york considering what the city 

563.29 568.27 A: promotes and the night life and the culture and as many people within the from all this city 

566.73 570.13 B: well i wonder how really really how healthy we are [laughter] 

569.56 572.29 A: yeah that's true too and i think we're 

571.23 572.86 B: you never know one day 

573.32 578.51 B: you know that could happen you know one day you you're healthy and happy and then one day you go somewhere and it's like 

579.26 580.17 B: (( you know )) 

580.19 581.67 B: you always have to wonder 

581.52 582.59 A: mhm 

582.41 583.48 B: what's happening 

584.07 588.17 A: or what's in the food that we eat is it genetically processed 

586.12 588.38 B: oh yeah all those things on like 

588.42 591.51 B: on those health risks you know that stuff from the salad bars 

591.53 592.60 A: mhm 

592.94 596.69 B: that's nasty and the restaurants like going out to eat 

594.34 595.17 A: (( yeah that's )) 

596.70 597.92 A: mhm 

596.81 599.96 B: they do all those shows on the you know restaurants and
