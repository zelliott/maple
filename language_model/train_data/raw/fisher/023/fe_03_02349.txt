46.37 50.81 B: then i definitely think that [noise] it would be um you know 

50.90 53.95 A: yes it would be the it would be the worst 

51.33 57.69 B: pretty bad [laughter] because it affects so many people so many other family members and

539.60 540.77 A: you know what i mean

546.13 548.33 A: yeah [laughter] 

547.73 550.32 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] then i could do it for you [noise] )) 

549.47 551.37 A: that's that's right 

550.63 555.53 B: yeah but um if you're [noise] if you're able to homeschool any one else's [noise] kids 

555.64 557.85 B: that's a really good business 

557.26 558.59 A: yeah

568.87 570.10 A: that's great 

569.36 578.92 B: just on homeschool and [noise] living in california is like really really expensive [noise] so if you i encourage people if they have that ability to work with children 

573.15 574.35 A: yeah i know 

578.93 584.24 B: and and they kno- at least anything about home schooling that you could start your own business doing this i mean 

584.33 589.36 B: [noise] thousands and thousands and thousands o- of dollars every month and just stay at home [noise] 

587.31 588.39 A: wow 

589.45 591.64 A: i don't think i'd have the patience [laughter] 

591.27 595.19 B: (( really [laughter] [noise] a lot of people think that too well you know [noise] yourself best )) 

596.43 597.55 B: (( [noise] you know you ))
