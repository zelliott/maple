6.17 7.30 B: um 

7.49 13.38 B: are are we supposed to answer the question of what we think is the worst i think smoking what do you think 

10.69 12.28 A: yeah i'm pretty sure 

12.94 18.26 A: yeah i agree i think smoking is probably the worst as far as health effects and things like that go 

18.10 22.36 B: well are we are we allowed to agree this is my first call so 

21.62 24.45 A: 'cause yeah it's my first also [laughter] 

23.28 26.89 B: oh okay well are we supposed to say why we think smoking 

26.57 28.53 A: yeah i'm pretty sure 

28.10 31.63 B: okay well first of all i think it's very self destructive 

31.12 32.07 A: mhm 

31.73 44.09 B: um and um it's it's a it's a bad and sick habit and i've known people that died of lung cancer uh i had a girlfriend of thirty eight that died of lung cancer 

40.43 41.47 A: mhm 

43.87 44.73 A: yeah 

44.35 48.66 B: and it not only affects yourself but it affects people around you too 

48.28 49.27 A: yeah 

48.67 50.96 B: um residual smoke 

51.68 56.68 A: yeah um i'd say i definitely have to agree that for the smoking that's probably the worst 

56.68 67.91 A: 'cause people my age i'm a teenager and um i know a lot of my friends that smoke and it's definitely really really addictive and they did it because it's relaxing from stress and everything but in the end i mean 

67.79 80.61 A: it really doesn't do anything that's a positive effect at all and people's parents who smoke and [sigh] i've heard percentages and everything of you know kids and things that die from just the secondhand smoke is really really bad yeah 

73.60 74.40 B: (( [noise] )) 

80.47 88.16 B: i don't see any redeeming uh habits to smoking i mean some people feel it keeps their weight down and i'm an ex smoker 

86.20 87.25 A: yeah 

88.13 89.24 A: yeah 

88.27 93.94 B: and when i stopped smoking i didn't put on any weight because i made sure to eat properly 

93.45 94.51 A: mhm 

94.07 105.80 B: um and i felt a lot better i could taste food um i didn't have to clear my throat and this was like twenty years ago when my doctor said my throat was in a precancerous stage 

105.35 106.37 A: mhm 

106.45 118.87 B: so i'm feeling a lot better but i'm a little nervous about it i always have my do you uh well you you're [mn] i'm in my forties so i go for lung xrays every year what about you do you go for any lung or chest xrays 

106.55 107.41 A: wow 

118.64 122.94 A: no i'm just a teenager so [laughter] i'm seventeen 

120.47 121.80 B: how old are you 

122.57 126.14 B: oh that's a wonderful wonderful age did you ever smoke 

124.34 125.45 A: [laughter] 

125.92 134.27 A: um i have tried one drag off of a cigarette once and i hated it and so i'll never try it again and i'll never bother with it no 

134.72 136.45 A: definitely not [laughter] 

135.66 148.11 B: uh-huh well they say it's the hardest thing to give it up but i you i got you know scared so much about smoking that i just automatic- i just stopped cold turkey and i had no problem giving it up 

145.84 146.71 A: yeah 

148.00 152.16 A: yeah i i hear it's pretty hard i mean i have friends that smoke and things and 

152.20 162.19 A: they've tried to quit and they've tried to go on the patch and everything and it just it hasn't worked for them at all so maybe maybe that uh they'll see the light some day [laughter] but 

161.45 174.18 B: well tell them to go to a doctor and they'll scare the hell out of them i had a girlfriend thirty five who died she was a bartender too so she smoked and had residual you know the residual smoke from from tending bar 

168.18 169.01 A: wow 

173.92 175.04 A: mhm 

174.40 187.74 B: so it was a double whammy but it's um [sigh] you know if you have if you get cancer or emphysema from other things it's one thing but we are control of our lives with this 

182.93 184.09 A: mhm 

187.30 188.24 A: yeah 

188.77 194.16 A: yeah [cough] i don't know what do you think about uh in restaurants and things should people be allowed to smoke in there 

193.95 194.97 B: no 

195.15 202.22 B: no only because uh other people are affected by it and i can't handle smoke that's why i don't go to bars 

199.34 199.90 A: (( yeah )) 

201.86 203.81 A: yeah yeah 

202.89 211.58 B: so i i agree with the laws about um not allowing smoking you know in restaurants because it does affect other people 

211.26 212.35 A: mhm 

211.65 213.88 B: if you wanna smoke go smoke at home

221.96 224.69 B: so what else do we have to say about this [laughter] 

224.02 228.18 A: um well i think we're just supposed to keep talking for ten minutes [laughter] 

226.88 231.38 B: oh is it that many minutes just talking about smoking or anything else 

230.92 234.79 A: um well what else was on that list they had overeating or something 

234.67 242.96 B: well overeating i think is also detrimental but you see overeating is um is not deadly it's um 

242.85 248.53 A: yeah it's not as deadly and it's not as much of an addictive thing as something like nicotine or 

248.83 249.90 A: but 

249.29 261.08 B: well it could be addictive you know um people with addictive personalities will gamble smoke overeat or be maybe anorexic or bulimic you know um 

251.17 252.29 A: yeah 

259.30 260.16 A: yeah

396.24 397.19 A: yeah 

399.27 400.24 A: yeah 

399.63 401.25 B: you know it's just not worth it 

401.24 405.52 A: did you ever have any problems like after it was precancerous or anything or 

405.02 413.42 B: no it was it's what you call lucaplecomy which is a um [lipsmack] it it's a temporary situa- it's a it's a changing of the cells 

413.03 414.43 A: mhm 

413.69 422.91 B: and it could change and turn cancerous or it can revert back to normal healthy cells if you eliminate the cause 

419.82 420.88 A: mhm 

422.70 424.00 A: yeah 

423.44 428.59 B: and the cause of of the irritation of the of the change was was the smoking 

428.37 429.71 A: mhm 

428.89 440.09 B: and um and then i said well i'm not gonna gain weight because i'm very you know i'm very active and i'm very involved with with weight and i just had to you know watch it so i 

440.37 451.26 B: [mn] so i just didn't feed my face you know instead of putting of a cigarette in my mouth i wouldn't put a piece of chocolate in my mouth but um yeah i'm very lucky most people have withdrawals 

446.09 447.23 A: mhm 

451.19 458.11 A: yeah wow it it's surprising you were able to get away with from it fairly easily after five years of smoking i mean

463.61 464.80 A: mhm

470.58 471.89 A: yeah 

471.34 472.84 B: than i was 

472.47 480.55 A: yeah defin- yeah probably more health conscious but [laughter] kinda risky at the same time i don't know there's so much stuff going through high school so 

480.63 481.84 A: yeah 

481.26 483.96 B: well you can you know you can't live in a bubble 

483.63 485.11 A: yeah exactly
