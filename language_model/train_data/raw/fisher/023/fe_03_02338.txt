17.56 18.49 B: right 

17.92 30.47 A: of the things from other people hurt people physically the other things some things can hurt other people emotionally so you have like gossiping which can like hurt other people emotionally then you have like smoking which not only hurts you can you know damage other people 

21.95 22.85 B: mhm

38.86 42.01 A: and not exercising which pretty much just hurts you and then 

40.95 42.36 B: hurts you uh-huh 

42.10 45.31 A: what was the last one i don't remember [laughter] 

43.91 46.87 B: (( um i think it let's see there's five )) 

46.05 50.15 A: there was like over like not exerci- over was it overeating

49.77 51.50 B: yeah overeating right 

50.93 52.58 A: oh god 

51.82 63.45 B: mhm i think of the ah the one of the worst is um not exercising for yourself and um other people i guess maybe mm 

63.69 65.72 B: smoking or [laughter] 

65.09 78.07 A: you know what i'm gonna say anne i'm gonna say ah you know consume you know overly consuming alcohol because that not [mn] not o- not only are you you you you know you're damaging yourself 'cause alcohol's such a harmful drug for your body um 

66.63 67.36 B: what 

71.05 71.97 B: mhm 

76.17 77.76 B: right mhm 

78.55 87.07 A: there's a whole set of behaviors that go along and i've i've unfortunately i've got experience with this [laughter] you know ah there's a whole set of behaviors that go along with 

80.21 81.20 B: mhm 

83.79 84.85 B: mhm 

87.02 101.46 A: alcoholism that hurt other people not not only physically which you could you know not only you know do people who some people who consume too much alcohol end up being can be physically abusive but you know they can end up driving and and hurting other people and 

88.88 89.72 B: right 

94.58 95.85 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

100.67 101.49 B: true 

101.33 114.25 A: you know but also you emotionally hurt other people too when you you know there's so i think it it can be damaging to a lot of people in diff- in a lot of different ways but also damaging to yourself so i think out of the five that's probably the worst 

104.07 104.96 B: mhm 

110.89 112.02 B: mhm 

113.61 115.66 B: mhm i think so too 

115.41 116.67 A: yeah okay 

115.88 121.57 B: yeah and so many drunk drivers continue to you know travel our highways and you know take the 

120.67 122.65 A: even after they lose their licenses 

122.24 124.87 B: exactly mhm that's true 

123.12 132.00 A: yeah so i mean you'd be amazed you know i i've worked in the counseling field just how many people have had multiple drunk driving arrests you know just 

125.05 125.63 B: (( mhm )) 

130.81 133.05 B: mhm mhm 

132.44 134.73 A: and then then arrested without you know 

134.63 149.29 A: they fir- they they get arrested they don't have their license and they have the d._u._i. on top of that and it's just it's just a whole circle you know people that you know god [mn] over over five d._u._i.s and it's just oh when are you when are you gonna learn that's there's a problem and 

136.90 138.01 B: mhm 

138.87 139.76 B: right 

148.80 149.87 B: i know 

149.39 152.77 A: our i guess they just don't even care you know 

150.90 155.33 B: they don't they don't after a while they don't even care any more and you know it it makes it 

155.34 159.21 B: bad for the whole you know whole society as a whole because um 

159.33 166.86 B: nobody asks for them to get out there and do that and then when they kill thems- you know usually kill someone else and not themselves 

165.98 170.66 A: yeah yeah because when you're under the influence a lot of times you handle accidents better 

170.14 171.44 B: mhm 

170.78 178.42 A: you know the shock isn't there as much and it's it's kind of strange but yeah that's you're right so like other people are more at risk 

172.38 173.47 B: right 

177.94 180.03 B: mhm that is so true 

179.86 181.65 A: yeah so

191.95 193.09 B: yeah 

193.54 195.28 B: (( yeah that's true )) 

196.67 199.90 A: and a lot of people they it's it's the 

201.42 215.62 A: it's the the duality you wanna quit but it's just like you know no other life besides that and it's just so easy to go back and so tough in the long run to quit it's just the it's it's really really tough it's like i said i've had family members with and it's just 

205.65 207.78 B: mhm mhm 

208.93 209.80 B: right 

214.65 227.64 B: mhm mhm so have i you know and it's sad i'm praying for you know a nephew of mine right now and you know but like what do you do what can you do but the effects on the whole family are just devastating 

215.98 217.85 A: it's such do you 

227.50 232.49 A: there there's you know there's a saying the best thing you can do is just kind of it's detaching with love 

232.43 233.37 B: mhm 

232.60 244.22 A: you know it's it's you you can't you don't wanna do anything to enable the person to continue but you can always tell them that if they sincerely want help you can try to help them you know 

236.91 237.85 B: mhm 

238.40 239.61 B: exactly 

241.65 243.28 B: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

244.45 246.68 A: to a point you know because it's 

245.48 250.10 B: right but nobody can help them until they come to the point that they want help themselves 

248.01 253.19 A: oh absolutely that's that's they they that's they said until if they sincerely want help 

252.59 254.38 B: mhm mhm 

253.39 261.47 A: you know then you can try to help them but up until then you you can't really do anything no they they have to realize it yeah you know and it's you can 

254.87 255.83 B: right 

257.83 258.74 B: mhm 

261.30 271.52 A: [mn] all the the things you can do you can you know say it i'm not gonna be friends with you anymore i'm not gonna talk to you you can you could do that but ultimately yeah you're right that's their choice 

265.84 268.11 B: mhm mhm 

268.51 269.58 B: mhm 

271.06 272.74 B: yep it is 

272.32 276.92 A: it is it's really it's really a a tough thing especially with someone you love you know because 

275.91 277.91 B: yeah right true 

277.04 288.95 A: you see the person and you know the person maybe before they started the drugs and you know they're not a bad person it's just when they get under that influence yeah when they get under the influence of that it they become a totally different person 

278.16 279.16 B: mhm 

280.16 281.92 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

282.19 285.23 B: mhm mhm they just do bad things 

285.93 287.06 B: mhm

289.03 290.58 A: yeah it's really 

289.97 291.39 B: true mhm 

290.73 296.72 A: so it's it's tough because you still try to 'em for the person they really are but it's tough to love the things they do [laughter] 

293.00 295.28 B: mhm mhm 

296.09 298.88 B: right it is it really is

550.70 552.26 A: yeah so 

553.14 558.05 B: well i guess they'll still pay us 'cause we kind of veered away from the subject [laughter] 

557.14 565.91 A: well that i i think they're more looking for a way people converse and they talk you know they just have to give you a subject so you have something to talk about at first 

561.60 562.59 B: yeah 

563.54 564.49 B: right 

565.04 566.87 B: mhm mhm 

566.16 570.60 A: you know 'cause it's a linguistic study so i imagine you know they're just studying the way people 

570.89 571.62 B: (( ah )) 

570.92 572.70 A: people do talk yeah 

571.83 575.00 B: yeah and and converse about certain things 

574.39 586.19 A: yeah but we're we're both in agreement that alcohol ah consuming too much alcohol's probably the most harmful of you know smoking is there smoking 'cause i looked at the things that are harmful to the person and also harmful to other people and 

579.52 581.05 B: it is yeah 

585.55 587.19 B: mhm 

586.23 589.43 A: i think smoking would be second aft- after you know 

589.09 590.14 B: yeah 

589.56 591.36 A: excessive alcoholism 

590.97 599.89 B: yeah and smoking once you start it it it's so hard to quit they say because of the i used to but i quit i was successful in in my quitting you kn- 

594.69 595.73 A: you smoke 

596.86 597.89 A: oh
