9.86 10.93 A: how's it going 

12.43 18.64 A: i haven't seen anything but i [mn] i just got my first call about two weeks ago so i'm i'm you know be patient and see what 

18.86 26.21 A: uh what happens seems seems pretty good i mean legitimate so you know it's a pretty good system so i hope that they come through [laughter] 

26.72 31.15 A: but um but we'll try it out [lipsmack] anyway it's been [mn] it's been interesting calls anyway

33.85 37.46 B: (( yeah um do you have any hobbies )) 

34.99 36.13 A: um 

36.85 40.11 A: mhm well i was just thinking it's funny because 

40.57 42.49 A: i guess it's a fine line between 

42.77 43.98 A: um 

44.05 54.55 A: [lipsmack] i guess [mn] people could say that um what i'm doing uh what i'm trying to do for a living should probably be more of my hobby and sometimes it's told to me by my family or or maybe girls that i meet but i see it uh uh i don't know 

54.60 59.42 A: [lipsmack] for example i lo- love music and i love films and i'm trying to get into those fields 

57.06 57.94 B: uh-huh 

59.61 70.95 A: and i guess you could say since i'm not doing that completely or fully 'cause i have a regular job um that that could probably be sort of my my hobby but i'm [mn] hoping that those things take or lead me to bigger things [laughter] 

71.05 74.37 A: um uh but anyway um 

71.97 72.82 B: yeah 

74.69 76.96 A: (( [lipsmack] for example uh let me see quickly )) 

77.63 84.65 A: [sigh] actually i don't i don't think there's anything else that i do aside from just doing you know doing my work and doing my little things where i that i hope 

84.97 86.66 A: could lead me to other things so 

85.30 87.78 B: what kind of things do you what kind of music things 

86.87 90.98 A: well for example i i have i just bought me a synthesizer 

91.24 103.91 A: a casio synthesizer that's kind of nice sounding almost like the real thing uh a year ago and i once in a while sit down and play with it [lipsmack] but the thing is i'm getting more into filmmaking and pho- photography and stuff like that and um 

94.89 95.64 B: right 

102.59 103.45 B: (( uh-huh )) 

103.83 109.24 A: but i i'm [mn] i'd like to do some acting but the thing is i'm not doing those things too too actively as i could say 

109.06 118.14 A: i'm actually getting more into film distribution with some other friends and i'm just hoping that those things i'm doing some day lead me let me do more of my music or maybe uh 

112.23 113.23 B: (( oh )) 

117.92 124.41 A: like some of my photography to them maybe we do some videos or some little films that i can use my photography you know it's for that 

124.45 130.76 A: but i currently am not doing it so yeah so hopefully the distribution thing [mn] we are actually um [lipsmack] 

130.84 135.56 A: well now actually i was going to say i don't actually could call it a hobby anymore because we have a full fledged 

135.67 145.11 A: [mn] corporation we we sign and [mn] of the state of california and everything and we use a lot of time for that a l- l- um a l- a lot of my money's going into that as well 

145.41 150.80 A: so i don't know uh i'm kind of [laughter] [mn] talking quickly but let me [mn] do you have any hobbies yourself 

151.02 156.20 B: uh yeah i like water skiing and travelling and movies yeah 

154.49 155.46 A: okay 

155.75 156.79 A: okay 

157.38 160.39 A: it sounds like you have a good time [laughter] doing that stuff 

160.17 161.21 B: yeah 

160.63 161.95 A: um 

162.18 163.45 B: where do you live

165.20 167.98 B: oh okay i live in brentwood 

167.84 178.28 A: oh okay funny last time i talked to somebody from [mn] i think it was maybe the the the south west somewhere i mean maybe like it sounded like a tennessee person and the other person was from northern california so that's interesting 

175.06 176.30 B: oh yeah 

178.32 188.26 A: um yeah and actually i'm very much into nutrition myself i i work at a vitamin store and i i i do like taking my vitamins and stuff like that and i guess 

188.21 196.88 A: maybe as a hobby i could say like i've too active with my work but i finally get back to that so i guess i could see that as a hobby although i se- 

197.26 203.20 A: i think it's it's something very important for me to do i do want to get a little stronger and [mn] want to gain some weight 

203.09 216.90 A: and i love you know reading the articles on how a body works and what's good to do for oops my ph i think that's my phone line um and i like to read about how certain vitamins work and what would be a good exercise to do for me and i'm just going very slowly i mean i'm 

203.38 204.44 B: right 

216.90 226.03 A: tall and very thin but it's got a long to go but uh i do want to go slowly and just it's like if i could say that could be a that's a hobby um 

224.75 225.54 B: yeah 

226.35 228.43 A: (( and they were asking if if )) 

228.48 234.43 A: [mn] people should have one and i think everyone should be able to have something [mn] that they occupy themselves that's different from their work 

234.17 235.11 B: right 

234.22 237.14 A: or different from their regular things uh um 

236.91 239.65 A: it's kind of like the way i put it sometimes i think everyone should have a a 

239.51 241.93 A: good best friend and then that 

240.96 241.90 B: mhm 

241.88 255.54 A: you know that person can well they they can do stuff or or talk about life and do things and i guess that could i like talking on the phone i have friends and i like talking to them about all kinds of things that could be a hobby of mine yeah talk to talk to my friend who lives in newtown and we talk about all kinds of stuff 

255.57 259.63 A: and i don't mind spending time on the phone um but you know with that kind of thing
