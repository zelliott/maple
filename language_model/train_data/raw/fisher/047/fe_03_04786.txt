0.24 1.34 A: hi 

1.39 2.86 B: hi [laughter] 

2.23 4.26 A: [laughter] i'm stan it's 

3.73 5.24 B: i'm liz [laughter] 

4.65 5.93 A: nice to meet you liz 

5.48 6.51 B: (( nice to meet you )) 

6.08 9.06 A: [laughter] so do you smoke 

8.73 10.19 B: i don't do you 

9.83 11.25 A: i don't 

10.92 13.23 B: okay what do you think of smoking 

11.42 12.10 A: uh 

12.68 16.14 A: well it's interesting 'cause i live in new york city 

15.54 16.62 B: oh so do i 

16.19 19.89 A: oh okay so you know that it's been like total crackdown 

19.55 21.15 B: right exactly 

20.96 22.10 A: um 

21.97 27.02 A: and a sort of like a regular bar i go to every weekend with my girlfriend 

26.84 41.58 A: which used to be like a place heavily smoking you know great so now everybody has to go outside which is a drag you know socially but [laughter] on the other hand it's like you know i hate to admit it but it's kinda nice to be in there where there's no smoke 

30.75 32.22 B: right right 

38.02 39.34 B: yeah i mean 

41.17 46.93 B: oh yeah from a personal point of view as a non smoker it's definitely nice i don't know how i feel about a um 

44.71 45.62 A: yeah 

47.25 52.01 B: y- you feel like they're sort of taking away some of the freedom that people have you know it's 

51.34 53.40 A: [noise] yeah uh definitely [noise] 

52.73 58.83 B: if they can do this what else can they take away but i i like it it means that we don't come out smelling like smoke afterwards 

56.71 57.96 A: [laughter] 

58.19 61.97 A: exactly 'cause like so many nights we did totally smell of smoke 

62.16 74.48 A: but interesting i was also just uh this sunday um i was at like a tiny little bar in the east village and it was like total smoking haven there were ashtrays on all the table and like 

62.19 63.13 B: um 

73.74 76.10 B: oh so they haven't cracked down on it at all 

75.43 78.22 A: no so like i think the little you know 

76.78 81.25 B: yeah it doesn't seem it's been so well enforced like i i don't know what they do if they 

81.36 83.85 B: what if they catch you smoking [laughter] 

83.06 96.21 A: exactly oh there are so many like tiny little pubs and things in new york it's probably impossible to catch them all and this one's like you know it's very tiny only locals go there and it's sort of in the middle of a block so they figure what are their chances of being caught i guess 

96.18 103.31 B: right right exactly um yeah it's a state law in new york now right or is it just a city law 

97.81 99.41 A: (( hm )) 

101.81 110.01 A: yeah just um i think it was first the city law and then just recently they passed the state law which was like even tougher than the city law 

109.39 113.45 B: right 'cause i had heard something about how i think initially they had said that 

113.52 122.10 B: when it was just a city law they could designate sort of just specific smoking areas in the bars and a lot of the bars have spent a lot of money sort of renovating um 

121.53 122.73 A: mhm 

122.33 130.96 B: to to create these pure smoke you know like just all smoke free zones and then smoke like to separate them and then i think the state law came in 

126.78 127.65 A: yeah 

129.01 129.78 A: yeah 

131.37 134.23 B: you can't even have a smoking area 

132.93 144.74 A: yeah i think i think that's exactly right [laughter] [laughter] yeah i know and i was thinking like back in the past you know a lot of places put in you know air ventilation things for really smoky bars and it's like all 

134.70 138.18 B: so they spent a lot of money on it and i'm sure they're not very happy about it 

143.59 147.23 B: right yeah but it used to be that you would just come back and um 

147.29 153.25 B: all you know your hair would smell like smoke everything you couldn't like get rid of it so i'd have to say i like it 

149.49 151.29 A: yep [laughter] 

152.70 155.27 A: right yeah i guess i do too 

155.34 157.02 A: (( so you know there are )) 

157.09 159.22 A: on one hand it's kind of 

159.24 163.62 A: you know i feel it's a pretty addictive thing smoking in general so i can under- 

162.30 167.93 B: yeah and it's a health hazard to people who aren't smoking as well too i mean secondhand smoke is not good 

165.41 168.82 A: exactly and all the waitresses and the people in there right 

168.12 172.10 B: and the customers and the some people are allergic to it [laughter] 

169.73 170.56 A: yeah 

172.73 184.19 A: but you know it's gonna probably cause a whole new set of problems i know for instance a friend of mine lives above a bar and since now like everybody stands in front of it and smokes it's like twice as noisy as it used to 

172.75 173.56 B: (( uh )) 

182.42 195.69 B: yeah it's like it's like whenever you walk outside now and uh you don't see people in the bars you see them standing outside they're empty i mean i don't know i don't know what the deal is with outdoor seating areas i feel like they can't really 

185.72 186.84 A: [laughter] 

188.88 190.97 A: right [laughter] 

195.18 200.33 A: yeah there was i read something one place got fined because 

196.82 198.49 B: restrict it outdoors 

200.49 207.68 A: i think they had like maybe you're designated one outdoor table or something and they had ashtrays on too many tables or something so it's 

207.70 208.53 A: (( you know )) 

208.58 210.60 A: it's equally weird crackdown 

209.98 211.70 B: right right 

211.49 213.08 A: (( hm )) 

212.30 218.60 B: hm [laughter] i don't know what else to say about this topic um i don't really smoke um 

213.12 217.24 A: [laughter] i know i know we're agreed on this issue 

218.45 224.17 A: i smoke the occasional cigar you know but r- like like you know playing poker with the guys or something 

221.25 224.79 B: right but that's like in a special occasion thing right 

224.99 233.09 B: um [lipsmack] what else is there to say about i don't know have they have they added like new taxes to cigarettes and stuff too or is it just 

227.59 228.51 A: [laughter] 

232.45 243.18 A: well i know that it's it i don't think they've added taxes since the last tax raise but the last tax raise was pretty enormous it was you know it's like seven or eight dollars a pack now or something 

237.46 238.56 B: right 

239.73 241.67 B: (( i mean it's a pretty expensive habit )) 

243.16 244.52 B: yeah 

244.04 256.55 A: and you know a lot of people i know are just i don't know but what i've read is that um people are just you know going outside of the state for cigarettes or ordering it you know over the internet some indian reservations and so 

253.54 255.37 B: like over the internet right 

255.60 258.49 B: like buying it at airports or at the duty free 

257.80 262.00 A: exactly so new york's losing out an all the taxes they'd be collecting if it was you know 

261.34 269.93 B: yeah i'm sure there's still plenty of people buying um i mean they kind of if you're in new york and you want a pack of cigarettes you're gonna buy 'em if you need 'em especially if you're addicted 

266.66 267.55 A: right 

268.22 269.30 A: yeah 

269.47 271.26 A: yeah i suspect so 

271.52 282.20 A: and there's like a lot of uh fake you know like there are these websites saying you can buy a case of marlboro for a really cheap price but they're totally fake marlboros they're not [laughter] [noise] like cheap 

271.60 272.33 B: um 

281.97 287.86 A: quality one people think they're they're getting the real thing so there's this whole black market thing erupting now 

287.82 290.42 B: right right that makes sense to me 

290.06 291.76 A: yeah 

290.88 297.91 B: hm i don't know what are the other states it's new york i know california has a law against no smoking 

296.50 299.94 A: right yeah they were like the first trend setter if i remember 

298.81 301.56 B: are there any other states though i'm not sure 

301.14 302.75 A: hm i don't know 

302.41 305.89 B: [laughter] i mean we live in new york so i know about the new york 

303.02 303.80 A: yeah 

304.22 308.84 A: right typical typical new york centric people i have no idea what's going on in the other states 

308.50 312.20 B: stuff yeah i i mean i know i remember when it was in california but um 

311.62 312.36 A: (( mm )) 

312.69 315.10 A: i saw i just saw a headline today in 

315.28 318.32 A: (( that there were some sort of reliable )) 

316.58 321.13 B: (( 'cause you didn't realize you'd be speaking on it for ten minutes [laughter] )) 

319.05 320.94 A: [laughter] 

321.12 321.91 A: (( [noise] )) 

322.20 322.98 A: (( there was )) 

322.37 324.86 B: okay well what did it say [laughter] 

323.73 332.92 A: [laughter] there was some sort of global pact that's like i don't know many nations decided on some sort of anti tobacco anti smoking deals 

332.59 340.46 B: right i can't imagine this happening in europe so i feel like they would rebel a lot more than [noise] new yorkers do 

332.98 334.02 A: just like the s- 

335.88 337.31 A: yeah really it's like 

338.47 339.46 A: yeah 

339.89 341.43 A: yeah definitely 

341.23 343.26 B: i'm surprised new york has even like 

343.02 344.68 A: [lipsmack] tolerating it 

343.41 345.46 B: been okay with it yeah 

344.78 354.73 A: it's true you would think there'd be more outcry it's like [lipsmack] i don't know i guess people are just sort of finding their own way around it you know some probably don't mind going outside that much and you know 

353.87 362.67 B: well i- it's okay during the summer or as it gets warmer but like now like today where it's raining or when it's freezing cold in the winter not pleasant [laughter] 

356.41 357.58 A: yeah 

358.58 360.05 A: right or true 

360.88 361.79 A: yeah 

361.89 366.02 A: yeah things will probably change a lot when it gets like serious winter out 

365.88 367.05 B: right 

366.86 374.99 A: hm or you know maybe they'll repeal it's a [laughter] the fare hikes if they can find someone smart enough to take it to court 

372.81 374.43 B: right that's true 

374.72 380.25 B: yeah you never know although the fare hikes still haven't been repealed i mean they haven't they haven't overturned 'em yet so 

377.67 378.69 A: yeah 

379.80 380.74 A: true 

380.28 385.19 B: who knows um yeah there it's probably some infringement on some sort of 

385.43 386.60 B: freedom 

386.50 387.51 A: (( huh yeah )) 

386.75 391.02 B: i don't know civil liberty i don't know the right to smoke if that's a real right but 

390.70 392.96 A: [laughter] 

391.56 394.03 B: [laughter] it does seem like 

393.47 399.04 A: it does seem like well i don't know i mean i guess you can you can still smoke in your own home so it becomes just public 

399.41 401.09 B: just public places 

399.96 403.38 A: public issue yeah no 

402.22 407.54 B: um but i mean those are like private establishments too i mean they're kind of taking away 

407.11 408.42 A: (( [noise] true uh i )) 

407.83 409.59 B: they're not it's not like uh 

410.01 414.54 B: an office building or a [noise] government building it's like a p- i mean i i think 

414.36 416.12 A: don't know if there are 

414.83 420.82 B: i don't know like if it's like a private club or something that has a restaurant must be allowed i'm not really sure 

420.61 423.05 A: well for i think 

423.12 429.58 A: just thinking about grand central station if i remember i think before they passed the state law 

430.06 438.42 A: it was going to be okay to like smoke in grand central station and the restaurants that are in grand central station 'cause it's sort of a state owned thing rather than a city owned thing 

437.62 441.39 B: right but now that the state law passed that maybe has changed 

440.58 442.00 A: right 

441.56 444.86 B: hm i'm not quite sure about that 

443.69 453.23 A: yeah and there are laws for like business you know office buildings but i don't know if that's i don't know whose jurisdiction that is under 

449.19 450.34 B: right 

452.25 459.19 B: [noise] there's always been like there's been laws forever but on like airplanes now like you can't smoke on the airplanes or in airports or 

456.88 458.10 A: (( right yeah )) 

459.78 460.79 B: but uh 

460.88 464.92 B: i don't really know what the different laws regulating these different areas are 

463.45 467.05 A: [laughter] yeah exactly 

465.29 466.25 B: um 

466.38 473.89 B: it does seem like an airplane was particularly difficult because you couldn't really escape you know you're stuck on the plane you can't like leave it if you're 

472.57 474.89 A: right there's nowhere for the smoke to go 

474.31 476.19 B: really allergic to it 

475.53 481.14 A: yeah and people are like doing it in the bathrooms in the airplanes and setting off the smoke alarms 

480.52 483.42 B: right which is always a little bit frightening [laughter] 

482.55 485.13 A: [laughter] exactly especially these days 

485.20 489.84 B: um hey i don't know what they're going to do are they going to start arrest- like what happ- do you get fined if you're 

489.90 492.09 B: if you refuse to put out your cigarette i don't know 

491.34 495.06 A: yeah you do well i don't know if you do but i think the bar does 

494.44 497.04 B: oh the bar does but not the individual person 

496.75 504.55 A: in fact at least it's been the case so far i'd th- and i'd think that i think that's always gonna be the case i think it it's all upon the bar 

503.31 507.01 B: but what if the person refuses and the bar asks them to 

506.36 511.21 A: [laughter] right then it's like you know then you end up like the dead bouncer in the village 

511.65 513.25 A: (( not fight you know )) 

513.00 516.61 B: right right i do remember that that was only a couple of weeks ago 

516.14 522.27 A: yeah so i think it's like they're putting all the pressure on the bars and the restaurants to make sure it doesn't happen 

522.07 523.66 B: got it hm 

522.97 525.33 A: (( yeah so i don't know )) 

524.71 529.92 B: that seems kind of like i guess they're gonna have to get big strong bouncers who are you know 

528.56 530.79 A: (( like [laughter] )) 

530.79 539.03 B: and i i guess the police are coming in and checking or are they doing like routine checks i don't really know how this is going to be so well [noise] enforced i hadn't really 

538.16 544.36 A: that's the other thing it's like you know they've got [laughter] they've got a lot of other better things to be doing right now than going around bars 

542.67 547.56 B: it does to me that there would be better things to do than wandering around bars but 

545.19 546.21 A: yeah 

546.87 554.88 A: right i know there was an article uh maybe a week ago in the paper how they you know they did like some token arrests and it was like 

554.81 563.14 A: swankies on the upper west side and and like the pierre hotel they picked like you know a fancy place in like a public kind of hang out 

557.18 558.27 B: [noise] oh really 

563.00 567.60 B: just to cause fear and be able to show them that it was like real 

563.32 564.28 A: and 

564.68 567.97 A: [laughter] exactly set examples 

568.22 569.10 B: hm 

568.66 576.47 A: so you know it's entirely possible they could do that and you know it would be easy enough for them to like pick places that you know they wanna pick on for whatever reason 

576.84 577.85 B: right 

577.86 579.70 B: right that makes sense 

579.04 582.08 A: (( yeah so probably )) 

580.47 583.82 B: hm how much longer do we have to talk on this topic for 

582.39 587.28 A: i don't know it seems like we [laughter] we've [laughter] been talking about smoking for a long time um 

583.92 584.75 B: [laughter] 

587.31 589.52 A: it can't be it can't be much longer 

587.50 588.97 B: [laughter] 

589.50 592.42 B: i don't think so [laughter] 

590.05 591.99 A: [laughter] 

592.33 593.73 A: they're just torture 

592.84 597.65 B: it's all types of smoking too right it doesn't matter what it's uh it's um 

595.71 597.19 A: [laughter] 

598.07 599.89 B: cigarettes pipes all
