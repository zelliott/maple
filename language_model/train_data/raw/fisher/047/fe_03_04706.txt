0.00 0.39 B: (( [mn] )) 

0.51 2.19 B: hello my name is richard 

1.70 4.02 A: [sigh] hi my name is craig 

2.62 3.18 B: (( [mn] )) 

3.86 5.34 B: okay craig 

5.47 11.02 B: well i'm glad to talk to you this is my first chance to discuss hobbies [sigh] now 

9.71 10.98 A: (( [mn] [mn] uh-huh [lipsmack] ah )) 

11.23 16.58 B: f- th- w- well the first thing i'm intrigued about about hobbies is how would you define a hobby 

17.34 20.46 A: i think it would just be something ah 

20.77 25.05 A: [mn] that you do for enjoyment rather for than for income [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] 

25.08 28.75 B: (( [sigh] okay well there's a good definition i my ah )) 

29.03 36.28 B: [lipsmack] my particular perspective on it well why i'm so intrigued about [noise] it it's because [sigh] hobbies can cover a great 

36.76 44.62 B: f- field and i don't simply mean the selection of the hobby itself but the concept of the hobby [sigh] for instance one can say um 

44.87 56.51 B: playing marbles is a hobby but you could also i i could also say philosophy is a hobby but [sigh] playing marbles and studying philosophy are not quite the same thing 

55.94 57.27 A: (( no not at all )) 

56.97 61.48 B: and yet they both could be classified as hobbies that's why i was intrigued [sigh] 

62.17 67.02 B: i was intrigued in what you had to say now i [sigh] consider that um [lipsmack] 

67.96 74.62 B: that hobbies primarily are a form of a protracted activity that one does at leisure [lipsmack] 

74.17 78.46 A: [sigh] yes more or less for entertainment your own entertainment or 

79.05 87.85 A: [sigh] something ah maybe not just to occupy your time but something that you do i would say just merely for the enjoyment of it [noise] 

88.15 96.98 B: yeah enjoyment but something constructive in it and i don't mean pedagogical necessarily but sa- [sigh] there is an objective 

91.58 92.52 A: (( right [sigh] )) 

97.03 103.87 B: in the hobby besides simply passing time there's something [sigh] you're trying to do there's something you're trying to achieve 

103.52 104.65 A: right 

104.03 106.51 B: [sigh] and ah and i think it's [sigh] 

106.96 114.58 B: very it's it it has to be um [mn] classified as constructive because um 

112.46 113.68 A: (( [sigh] right [mn] )) 

114.88 116.46 B: [mn] i feel 

117.26 125.34 B: [sigh] that simply passing time [mn] sitting for instance very seldom will anyone say watching television is a hobby u- 

125.57 126.66 A: that's true 

126.36 127.62 B: (( um [sigh] )) 

127.95 135.47 B: and yet i s- suspect a great many people spend most of their leisure time in front of a television set 

134.90 136.15 A: yeah 

135.87 137.05 B: (( [sigh] so )) 

137.33 146.47 B: [sigh] so i think there's something constructive and there's something on the part of the person that [sigh] who is engaged in a h- h- hobby of course which makes him active [noise] 

148.43 152.28 A: [sigh] [sigh] yeah i know as far as as far as hobby you said ph- 

152.19 163.56 A: that you could say philosophy for you [sigh] but as as far as um a more um [sigh] mainline hobby for myself i'd have to say is is probably coin collecting 

162.99 164.95 B: [lipsmack] oh that's great [lipsmack] 

164.21 171.57 A: so um i've been doing that for a while and and i enjoy it i haven't really [sigh] i know some people do it to try to make money [noise] 

173.95 177.99 A: [mn] some people try to make money with it but i i don't do it for that 

177.70 178.78 B: okay 

178.85 183.34 B: well i could certainly understand that have we been talking ten minutes 

182.99 185.49 A: [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] ah no we haven't that was a 

184.44 187.61 B: i didn't think so i heard some- i heard something i heard some- 

186.73 189.09 A: i heard it also but it's [noise] [sigh] 

188.19 197.28 B: no i don't think we've been talking for ten minutes well coin collecting now i've never collected coins for a while i collected stamps when i was much younger 

195.50 196.38 A: uh-huh 

197.03 198.04 A: (( [sigh] uh-huh [sigh] )) 

197.48 199.07 B: (( and ah )) 

199.36 203.08 B: [sigh] it was something that i quite enjoyed for 

203.37 204.74 B: a short while [sigh] 

204.63 205.97 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

205.21 219.81 B: i think [sigh] one hobby i would like to develop would be [sigh] i would like to develop a taste in art [sigh] because i came from a small town and although books were readily a- a- ah accessible to me 

219.43 220.77 A: (( [sigh] uh-huh [sigh] )) 

220.30 230.43 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] there were no art museums and now that i live in a big city because i'm in philadelphia [sigh] i just f- feel that there's something lacking i can you know i [sigh] 

224.85 225.84 A: uh-huh 

230.68 238.08 B: i can go i mean i can barely tell a a monet from a renoir okay i just [laughter] you know i [sigh] i know what they are 

236.27 237.82 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] yeah well )) 

237.98 245.75 A: i'm pretty much the same way when it comes to art i'm really ah [sigh] i really would be classified as a beginner i really don't know that much about it 

245.32 251.53 B: [noise] well particularly the field field of painting music no i i'm much more ah better grounded but 

250.96 251.88 A: uh-huh 

251.66 258.41 B: ah but actually- when it comes to painting that's the one area where i just [sigh] i once saw a um rodin 

258.44 259.59 B: exhibit 

259.01 260.10 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

259.59 273.45 B: and i thought it was i was i was fascinated but if you asked me well what do you think of it i would say well it's intriguing i mean all the non committal ah [laughter] expressions i could come up with 

273.13 274.15 A: (( [sigh] right )) 

273.58 276.20 B: i i'd you know instead of saying i like it 

276.15 277.76 A: yeah yeah [sigh] 

276.81 282.57 B: and that should have been sufic- that should have been sufficient but [sigh] i'm not quite sure [sigh] 

282.40 293.40 A: well [sigh] i know with with painting i've i've never really been that interested in it [sigh] and i think one of the reasons is [sigh] that i am i am not very good at it at all 

293.31 296.35 A: [sigh] i mean i just i mean there are some people i've seen 

293.34 294.13 B: [laughter] 

296.12 301.58 A: [sigh] that you know they're i mean they they really are classified can be classified as an artist [sigh] 

301.36 315.92 A: and i i am [sigh] like the exact opposite no matter how hard i try [sigh] i just can't i cannot draw i cannot paint [sigh] i i just don't have a knack for it and i think that's why i really [sigh] i don't have that much of an interest for in it [laughter] 

315.60 320.51 B: okay what that's why as an aptitude for painting [sigh] i'd have a hard time drawing a 

320.38 333.11 B: a a a straight line with a ruler [laughter] it's just [sigh] it is totally beyond me [sigh] and ah but i just always felt that it was something lacking but that was a prospective hobby you know 

326.60 327.69 A: (( [sigh] uh-huh )) 

332.48 333.61 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

333.03 337.09 B: and i was thinking well maybe if i really could develop this 

337.28 338.61 B: (( [sigh] ah )) 

338.89 348.55 B: if i could j- just discipline myself to go to the art museum more and just but then there are so many other things i really like doing that i'd rather do so 

342.82 344.01 A: (( [noise] right )) 

348.15 349.13 A: uh-huh 

348.63 350.66 B: and that's what i end up doing 

351.03 353.52 B: [lipsmack] well what's another hobby of yours [sigh] [sigh] [lipsmack] 

353.10 354.72 A: (( [sigh] [lipsmack] [sigh] um )) 

355.53 367.27 A: well i don't i don't i don't really have right now i i don't really have any others that i could think of besides the coin collecting i mean there are other things i like to do [sigh] i like to i like to go you 

367.32 371.76 A: know camping and things like that but i don't really consider those to be hobbies 

372.02 375.28 B: okay that's intriguing and why don't you consider those hobbies [noise] 

374.91 377.37 A: [sigh] that's more of of [lipsmack] [sigh] 

379.08 380.44 A: um 

381.30 386.83 A: i don't know i guess i consider a hobby is just like something that that you would do by yourself 

387.06 391.68 A: [sigh] um i don't know i suppose it could be considered a hobby but um 

392.15 395.81 A: [lipsmack] i know i used to i used to have a um 

396.54 400.11 A: [mn] ah when i was younger i had we moved to this 

400.04 401.41 A: ah place that had a 

401.29 415.15 A: that someone had started building a a one room cabin and [sigh] out in the back [sigh] and i kind of took over from what they had started with and and i kind of considered that a hobby for a while that i was i was building that 

415.18 426.71 B: [sigh] well that sounds like a that sounds like pretty much of of a hobby well it was a pastime [sigh] and ah according to our definition of [lipsmack] at least i think the one we sort of agreed on [sigh] it was something constructive 

419.30 420.49 A: (( [sigh] [noise] yeah [mn] [noise] )) 

426.33 427.50 A: (( [mn] right )) 

426.97 435.48 B: and it was it took protract- it took ah protracted effort so ah i think that that would certainly class- ah [sigh] um [lipsmack] 

431.01 432.05 A: (( right [mn] )) 

435.52 438.36 B: ah could be classified as a hobby 

438.75 444.67 A: yeah well i i really enjoyed doing it and i [sigh] you know and i learned a lot while i was doing it too 

444.77 446.40 B: (( uh-hum )) 

445.75 458.00 A: [mn] [sigh] so [sigh] now i used to another thing i used to do is read and i just doing seem to read as much as i used to i just well it's mainly i suppose because i just don't don't find the time anymore [mn] [sigh] 

458.79 470.89 B: we- well also ah no i i am a i'm one of the great readers i like to think of myself as being [sigh] however i have noticed as i've gotten older it requires more effort 

465.12 466.44 A: (( but i see yeah [sigh] )) 

470.95 476.40 B: [sigh] and i think part of that is also just due to ah [sigh] as you know the ah 

476.83 480.26 B: as you said time [sigh] and also you reach i 

480.22 493.71 B: am reaching what i consider a [sigh] saturation point not that i'm not interested in reading but i've become far more selective at one time i was an avaricious re- reader [sigh] i would just read anything you sl- you you slapped in my hands 

489.38 490.27 A: (( [sigh] uh-huh )) 

493.17 494.38 A: (( yeah [sigh] [sigh] )) 

493.92 498.76 B: and at this stage in life now it's [sigh] getting i'm much more selective [noise] 

498.79 501.08 B: and see i had this particular [noise] 

501.17 509.82 B: um compulsion peculiar compulsion that once i start something i have to finish it [sigh] and i have suffered through awful books 

509.69 518.74 B: [sigh] [sigh] i remember ah as an undergraduate we had to read something called the wahlverwandtschaften it was [sigh] it was a book by goethe it's german 

518.90 527.87 B: it means the elective affinities and i hated that book so badly that i actually cried when i read it when i read the whole thing 

526.24 527.61 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] [sigh] [sigh] )) 

528.03 541.15 B: [lipsmack] and fortunately we were tested on it but now i think i could read it this i think i could sit through it without being upset [sigh] [noise] but i wasn't moved to tears because it was so moving i was moved to tears because i hated the book so much [sigh] [laughter] 

534.67 535.65 A: (( [sigh] [laughter] [lipsmack] yeah )) 

541.56 543.77 A: [sigh] [laughter] but you persevered 

543.16 551.91 B: but i had to i had no choice i just thought you know because it's just one of those things once i start [lipsmack] i always finish at least i try to [lipsmack] 

544.92 546.03 A: (( yeah [sigh] [noise] )) 

552.29 564.84 A: [sigh] oh that's good yeah i i like to i like to finish what i start too because if you don't [sigh] i always feel that that if i don't you know it's like ah it's kind of like i failed not not particularly that i gave up [sigh] but [sigh] 

564.75 569.22 A: it's kind of a little bit of of a sign of failure there and i don't like that either [sigh] 

568.71 570.85 B: (( [sigh] [noise] uh-hum )) 

571.57 575.25 B: well another thing h- hobby now let me think 

575.33 583.69 B: among the hobbies are there any hobbies that you at one time had that you you no longer practice or ah j- just given up on 

583.23 586.19 A: [sigh] [mn] [sigh] well i started when i did the 

586.28 596.42 A: [lipsmack] when i decided to become a coin collector i was also looking at the stamps at the same time [sigh] but it's just i just didn't have the interest or it seemed like there was [sigh] 

591.47 592.68 B: (( uh-huh [noise] [noise] )) 

596.84 598.80 A: there were too many 

599.29 599.89 A: (( and there was ))
