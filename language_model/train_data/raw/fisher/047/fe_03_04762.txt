9.85 11.18 A: i'm good 

10.57 12.39 B: good um 

12.58 17.38 A: so we're talking about how it's pretty much in every major city now 

17.71 19.22 A: um they're 

19.30 21.62 A: getting rid of smoking in public places 

21.78 24.08 B: right the ban on smoking 

23.68 24.76 A: yes 

24.17 31.31 B: um i think it's um pretty ah good idea i am an old smoker i i don't smoke now it's been some years 

30.93 31.75 A: okay 

31.35 41.12 B: but um you know just for as far as people are concerned that don't smoke i think it's a good idea it's for you know really for those that don't smoke um mhm mhm 

40.52 43.00 A: right i um 

43.28 45.13 A: i agree with you i think 

45.74 58.33 A: um [sigh] i think it's gonna hurt well i don't know i have mixed feelings i think it can potentially hurt the businesses in the sense that they're gonna get um 

59.46 65.91 A: fewer people fewer smokers to come to that you know to come these places that are banned from smoking 

66.32 68.64 A: but [sigh] um 

68.90 75.24 A: [lipsmack] you know i think it's i think it is fair i think it is fair 

73.56 77.63 B: it is fair it is fair um are you a smoker 

77.53 80.97 A: i'm a i'm an occasional smoker 

80.52 81.57 B: okay 

81.20 82.43 A: um 

82.82 86.63 A: you know i'll smoke when i go out and there's 

86.73 95.06 A: and there's a um maybe a cocktail involved but um yeah yeah yeah 

89.41 90.51 B: mhm 

90.94 101.10 B: sociably yeah that's what i was [sigh] now has that caused you not to certain places um be- because you might have wanted to smoke 

101.48 104.19 A: no ah good question um 

103.37 104.63 B: (( [laughter] )) 

104.64 107.32 A: no i i'm actually um [lipsmack] 

107.80 109.09 A: um 

109.32 113.22 A: you know i live in los angeles and so that's been in effect for a while 

110.72 111.79 B: okay 

112.82 114.36 B: mhm mhm 

113.53 127.12 A: it really doesn't i think um you know and then almost causing me to take back the comment i said about how it would deter people from coming i mean people people are gonna go people are gonna go to their favorite restaurants regardless 

124.49 125.26 B: right 

126.52 127.96 B: absolutely 

127.16 135.20 A: and there they're gonna go outside so i kinda the more i think about it you know well these these these calls they kind of put you on the spot for having to think but um 

128.89 129.80 B: right 

132.87 133.90 B: right 

135.31 143.34 A: the more i think about it yeah people are gonna go regardless and then they're gonna go outside or they'll go you know out here they have patios with heat lamps if it's you know 

143.09 150.82 B: mhm if you they have designated smoking areas or um like i watch people that smoke if i'm in a function or something 

145.02 146.38 A: yeah 

150.13 151.04 A: yeah 

150.67 163.02 B: um you know i'm here in virginia and um if if if they wanna smoke they they know now they must step outside with it so um i think the ban has has helped 

153.66 154.51 A: mhm 

159.73 160.65 A: right 

160.85 161.84 A: (( that was )) 

162.26 164.92 A: are they getting rid of it in virginia 

164.68 165.76 B: (( yes )) 

165.20 167.83 A: slowly wow 

165.87 167.11 B: yeah 

167.14 171.06 B: yeah more and more [laughter] but you say it's been there for years 

168.77 169.66 A: (( well )) 

170.64 171.80 A: right 

171.11 173.47 B: mhm mhm yeah 

172.23 173.22 A: right 

173.79 177.49 B: i'm i'm sorry i cut across you were you getting ready to ask me something 

177.34 178.73 A: what's that 

178.16 180.64 B: i thought you were ready to ask me something else 

180.06 182.87 A: (( ah no no no no i was )) 

182.90 184.82 A: [lipsmack] um [sigh] 

185.36 190.84 A: let's see so i don't i i the more i do you think it's a good do you think it's a good thing 

190.44 204.72 B: yeah absolutely um i i do um i can tell now when i go into certain places and the ban is not there you know you can tell the difference in the atmosphere you know being an ex smoker um you know 

191.50 192.51 A: yeah 

196.12 196.99 A: mhm 

198.65 199.42 A: yeah 

200.75 201.78 A: sure 

204.74 212.66 B: now i guess i see what i might have you know put other people through you know when i was smoking so um 

209.39 210.24 A: right 

210.92 211.83 A: yeah good 

212.82 227.00 B: i i think i think health purposes it it's definitely a a good thing um and um some restaurants you know they have designated areas so that right there helps a lot 

226.39 228.18 A: mhm sure it's it 

227.26 231.55 B: you know when you come in they'll say smoking or non smoking so so you 

230.68 232.19 A: so it's fair to everybody mhm 

231.58 241.57 B: right you have a choice so that way i guess that's a good way that they don't have to be too concerned about losing a lot of business because they give people the choice 

232.98 233.85 A: yeah 

241.25 246.04 A: right give both smokers and non smokers the choice yeah 

241.64 242.81 B: mhm 

244.04 247.28 B: absolutely right absolutely 

246.52 252.08 A: and i think that's maybe why um maybe why these laws came into effect was because the idea that 

252.13 258.68 A: non smokers don't have a choice when they're in a spot that allows smoking because 

253.26 254.23 B: right 

254.54 255.45 B: right 

258.77 265.72 A: the very um nature of smoking is that it leaks out into the atmosphere and they don't have a choice what they're breathing 

265.38 267.25 B: right right so 

265.94 267.24 A: yeah 

267.45 272.26 B: they um they're given the choice with the ban you know being on so 

270.43 271.42 A: right 

272.21 283.40 B: i i i really think it has been a good idea because there's you know there's moments that i don't want to be around it i don't wanna smell it and then go ugh smoke when they're smoking you know um so 

280.34 281.40 A: sure 

281.93 282.80 A: right 

282.95 284.86 A: and your clothes too you don't have to 

284.18 289.50 B: in your clothes your in your hair [laughter] yeah so 

285.08 286.55 A: it's much better 

286.88 290.28 A: [laughter] but no i mean that's true 

289.85 291.73 B: yeah so um 

291.92 306.68 B: i'm glad that i you know was hooked up with a person that didn't really oppose it you know um the thought of it because i could i was like oh my god i could get a smoker and it could be you know your opinion against my opinion but you know we seem to 

296.93 297.95 A: yeah 

306.67 311.14 B: both agree for heath consciousness for health reasons it's a it is a good thing 

310.83 312.34 A: (( right [cough] )) 

311.30 315.84 B: mhm [lipsmack] yeah yeah so um 

312.96 314.09 A: that is true 

314.96 316.02 A: (( mm )) 

315.92 320.74 B: mhm this is interesting my first um chance doing this 

320.32 322.60 A: me as well yeah 

321.10 330.40 B: okay great all right so i think we've done pretty good we'll continue to talk for ten minutes about smoking until they um tell us to stop 

323.18 323.92 A: yeah 

324.72 325.90 A: mhm 

330.15 331.90 A: that's true that's true 

331.01 334.12 B: okay okay how long did you smoke 

333.81 338.14 A: um well i still you know i i still smoke socially 

337.70 339.16 B: when did you start 

338.86 342.39 A: well [sigh] um i think i must've 

342.68 349.17 A: picked it like my dad always smoked so i i mean i may have may have picked up my first cigarette like thirteen fourteen 

344.39 345.41 B: okay 

348.13 349.90 B: (( um yeah okay )) 

349.34 356.87 A: and but you know i haven't been smoking like a habitual smoker since that age it's just been kind of an experimental thing but then when 

353.55 354.26 B: (( [mn] )) 

356.92 363.36 A: [noise] when i was able to guess when i turned sixteen or eighteen or whenever you know able to buy 'em that 

364.61 370.48 A: that i did kind of start not every day 'cause i was never a daily smoker but when i wanted to 

370.01 371.39 B: more frequently 

370.76 374.62 A: more frequently yeah exactly 

371.56 373.76 B: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

374.14 383.79 B: when i came to college you know try something new and ah [laughter] everybody else was smoking so i think i'll try it too you know so 

376.97 377.88 A: yeah 

377.92 378.82 A: yeah 

380.62 381.75 A: right 

382.94 387.69 A: yeah and that's when a lot of kids actually start when they do get their freedom to 

385.47 386.85 B: mhm 

387.00 391.95 B: yeah do have their freedom of choice it's like so um 

387.72 388.77 A: do that 

389.64 390.69 A: right 

391.93 396.92 B: a habit that time i i i think in the end i was just like you a social 

396.76 397.63 A: yeah 

396.78 405.45 B: a social smoker um if i went out had a drink you know i may have a cigarette you know um got to the point that when i um 

399.80 400.80 A: sure 

402.18 403.06 A: yeah 

405.28 413.19 B: started um smoking i had to have a piece of candy or i it had to be out that i was eating so i knew i was losing the desire 

412.55 414.22 A: right right 

413.12 425.25 B: and then i just you know i prayed on it and god he he released me from that so i [laughter] so it's been some years now so um i i am realy glad to see the ban and 

417.91 418.82 A: good 

419.39 420.58 A: that's good 

421.97 423.32 A: (( that's good )) 

425.06 430.41 B: you know like i said get more of a fresher atmosphere trying to be produced in um 

428.02 428.85 A: yeah 

430.43 434.60 B: the workforce and restaurants and all other places 

434.08 441.93 A: absolutely absolutely it is and when i moved out here just seeing it because it i think california kind of led the charge california's a real um 

434.83 436.24 B: yeah 

439.91 441.06 B: okay 

442.06 450.14 A: progressive state um they they kind of lead the charge on a lot of [sigh] new ideas and it's not to say [sigh] that there aren't lots of weirdos out here 

443.04 444.19 B: okay 

449.65 451.18 B: mhm 

450.36 458.62 A: 'cause i'm i'm from virginia actually mhm yeah i wonder if they paired um i've only been i haven't even been out here a year 

451.87 455.81 B: okay oh isn't that coincidental oh how long have you been 

458.14 460.87 B: oh okay okay okay great 

458.76 459.73 A: yeah 

460.52 471.74 A: but um you do notice that if you do go out um for in to to bars that um you come home and your you know your clothes do not smell 

471.54 472.64 B: (( oh okay )) 

471.97 482.11 A: you know and that's the exact opposite if you're if you're you know you go out and you go out a bunch and i mean you can't help it you're gonna come home smelling like the bar 

481.66 483.04 B: (( bar yeah )) 

482.46 484.24 A: yeah so i noticed that right away

495.51 500.49 A: mm yeah i know it is funny i wonder if the machine kind of paired it up that way i don't know 

500.14 502.25 B: i doubt it ah 

501.26 503.77 A: hm 

502.41 505.51 B: because how would they know you used to live in virginia 

504.94 508.16 A: that's right 'cause i guess i put my current right you don't say where you're 

505.57 509.83 B: [laughter] yeah 'cause you say los ang-

526.78 529.82 A: yeah hm 

532.86 537.85 A: well that's not bad i think it's like ten dollars a phone call something like that just to talk 

533.87 534.69 B: no 

536.05 537.16 B: (( yeah )) 

537.36 544.94 B: right ah so that's not bad at all especially when you have someone that has good conversation yeah [laughter]
