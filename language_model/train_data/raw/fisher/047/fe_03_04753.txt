81.00 82.21 A: exactly 

83.10 88.30 B: and i read i do work but i still read probably about three books a day 

88.23 89.15 A: uh-huh

113.45 123.13 B: i oh i exercise not that i love it but i know that i need it so i go to the gym i try for two hours three times a week 

116.69 119.23 A: right exactly 

123.35 125.17 A: that's that's quite a bit 

124.46 133.88 B: well it's i'm getting i'm in my sixties so it's sort of necessary so i can say that's probably the least of [mn] thing that i like to do but i know that 

133.91 136.27 B: that i need to do it so 

135.74 146.21 A: absolutely i read an article that uh that said uh working out as you age is actually very beneficial not just for your overall cardiovascular health but your 

144.69 145.73 B: mhm 

146.15 153.05 A: your body as well because the more muscle you have the less likely you are to like you know fall and break your hip or 

152.89 165.10 A: or any sort of you know really debilitating things that could happen to you as you age so uh yes i've uh yes i've uh stressed that i've stressed that to my grandmother multiple times that she needs to uh that she ne- 

152.89 153.85 B: right 

156.82 158.31 B: mhm 

158.65 160.64 B: we're supposed to last longer 

162.19 163.44 B: [laughter] 

163.50 165.70 B: but does she take your advice 

165.46 167.42 A: uh she does they have a 

168.28 176.37 A: [mn] work out sessions that she can be a part of down where she lives in florida so uh it's ver- it's very good for her so um 

172.45 174.20 B: okay uh-huh 

175.89 185.36 B: well my brother and his wife just moved to florida and they're he's almost seventy and they exercise and he's had heart attacks and he really keeps up with the gym program 

185.06 192.39 A: yeah it's it's very it's very important [mn] [laughter] so i guess i guess we should both uh count that as one of our hobbies exercising 

185.52 186.43 B: so 

190.99 202.76 B: well what i but i like to eat too i probably should not eat the junk that i eat but i you know i like hoagies or you know with the good stuff on it maybe chicken 

202.63 217.40 B: and so i guess a hobby is really that's how i spend some time with friends just going out and meeting them for dinner because they some of 'em still work full time so on the days that i have off i can meet them after they go to work 

213.13 213.92 A: (( mhm )) 

217.59 218.43 B: so 

218.72 220.86 B: (( it's enough to keep me busy for sure )) 

219.40 219.96 A: (( [mn] )) 

220.80 226.61 A: okay so that we cover all the topics here do you think it's important that uh everyone has a hobby 

226.31 236.41 B: i do i i i think it's important because i think if you get tuned into just yourself you can become very depressed you can become sad 

236.39 250.37 B: and it is sad that someone can get so much in to themself so you need a diversion you definitely definitely need a diversion and i find that i work with people who have a psychiatric illness 

243.31 244.38 A: mhm 

250.40 259.99 B: and we drive please walk please go to the gym please go read a book we say because you need to take your mind off a yourself 

260.20 265.08 B: and [mn] you know stop thinking negative things and go do something 

265.31 266.22 B: so 

265.52 273.06 A: i would i would say i'd have to agree with that i believe it's very important to have an outlet especially um 

273.39 281.65 A: you know just to to branch off from that uh whole idea i would say for just the creative um the element [mn] some most people 

282.05 291.60 A: don't use the opposite side of their brain and so uh they get so locked in to their daily routine or 

285.09 286.53 B: right mhm 

291.26 292.34 B: mhm 

291.45 302.99 A: uh work or school or whatever it may be and they don't make use of you know we we already use such a small percentage of our brain we don't need to be handicapping ourselves 

302.77 307.12 A: by not uh exercising the other parts as often as we can so 

306.14 306.87 B: right 

307.00 318.91 A: like i i try to uh really you know engage in things that are uh of opposite minded i i happen to have a a degree in mathematics so like i try to do things that are completely 

316.51 317.78 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

318.86 321.54 A: unrelated to that as opposed to 

321.44 335.22 A: more related to that even though that might be my interest uh i try to diversify it so that my brain doesn't you know because of the the the the fewer times that you make your brain actually branch out into new 

324.48 325.61 B: mhm 

335.45 345.40 A: ideas and things like that the less you use it the less it becomes active and [mn] you know as you age and i'm sure you can attest to you know y- you find yourself 

336.07 337.09 B: mhm 

342.24 343.14 B: mhm 

345.29 350.05 A: you know having to keep finding new things to keep your mind active um 

349.34 350.22 B: right 

349.86 364.83 A: or or you just become you know it [mn] it it's kind of a self um [lipsmack] self deprecating because you you make yourself ill and you make yourself uh less active by not engaging the most important organ probably in your body 

354.27 355.24 B: mhm 

355.92 356.68 B: (( mhm )) 

357.41 358.46 B: (( mhm )) 

360.97 361.99 B: mhm 

364.63 369.43 B: you're right i know uh it's almost like sedentary i mean your body can become sedentary if you're don't 

368.82 370.08 A: exactly 

369.82 383.46 B: but your brain can can to and if you don't use your eyes and if you're not for instance doing the crossword puzzles or doing something that's really going to keep your bri- brain working then it's almost going to stop functioning so [lipsmack] 

383.46 385.69 B: we have to it's really 

384.51 385.68 A: yes it's 

386.17 388.41 A: yes it's very important uh 

388.37 389.36 B: mhm 

388.51 397.02 A: you know even even [mn] i i happen to be in my twenties so uh i find myself even now you know with 

392.08 393.11 B: mhm 

396.97 411.46 A: and uh just [mn] the daily routine that i fail to have uh all the all the different diverse uh hobbies that i would like you know just because of time constraint or you have responsibilities 

398.00 399.08 B: mhm 

401.67 402.76 B: uh-huh 

410.20 411.16 B: right 

411.46 422.01 A: and uh y- you really have to you have to make that time important to uh ensure that you don't you know i don't i don't [laughter] want to i don't my brain 

416.27 417.11 B: right 

421.42 422.81 B: mhm 

422.32 429.87 A: [lipsmack] being not challenged because when that starts to happen i find myself exactly what you were saying about becoming depressed 

427.71 428.56 B: mhm 

429.53 430.40 B: right 

429.76 438.00 A: it uh you you begin to not appreciate the value of the things that you have 

436.84 437.76 B: mhm 

437.87 451.57 A: and uh everything seems more negative and when you're not engaging yourself and challenging yourself it's just uh it's not as fulfilling as a life is uh as you know we're all we all should be entitled to 

442.23 443.03 B: (( mhm mm mm )) 

451.22 460.52 B: i mean if if it's possible and even if in your twenties if you could say goodbye to work at five o'clock and then do something that you really really enjoy even though you might enjoy work 

460.31 467.64 B: i i think that might be the answer but when you're twenty the companies expect and thirties they expect a lot of you so sometimes it's 

466.91 481.61 A: right and at the and it's it's it's it's it's difficult because you feel like you're in the prime of your life and yet you're spending so much of it occupied in something that really is only meant to sustain you although 

467.79 469.07 B: it's hard to say 

473.21 474.42 B: mhm 

479.69 482.32 B: right that's what i have to say to my kids you know 

482.14 488.60 A: or or i mean granted there's some fulfillment in work as well i i get that or at least i i try to 

484.99 485.88 B: mhm 

488.23 489.20 B: mhm 

488.44 493.07 A: um you know in in doing my job and doing it well but uh 

492.89 502.23 A: there comes a point when i leave the office there so to speak and uh do do something completely unrelated i have to because if i don't 

496.91 497.92 B: mhm 

502.03 513.29 A: what i find is that actually it affects my work life because i become less productive and i become less um innovative in my ideas and my approaches to um 

505.14 506.05 B: right 

509.23 510.30 B: mhm 

513.10 517.88 A: to problems and to solving them and uh it's actually you know 

517.81 530.58 A: uh it it defeats the entire purpose of working extra long hours if you're just sitting there and not getting anything done because you can't think you know you're not you're not you're your mind's a your mind's a muscle and uh 

519.99 520.94 B: mhm 

522.81 523.70 B: right 

528.57 543.36 B: mhm well continue thinking like that because you sound pretty mature and you just don't want your whole life to be work i mean that is really sad and you lose friends that way you know if you get so in- involved in yourself and work 

532.38 534.18 A: [laughter] 

538.23 539.20 A: it 

543.25 544.59 B: [lipsmack] that's tough 

544.67 548.09 A: [mn] so uh so you've been wor- working out now 

547.69 555.39 B: oh i'm working out tomorrow's another day and monday went no i guess it's monday thursday and saturday that's what i do mhm 

548.35 549.40 A: (( hobbies )) 

550.39 551.49 A: uh-huh 

555.12 558.37 A: and what what what type of workout is that 

557.04 565.98 B: i do [mn] uh no not aerobics i do the treadmill i do the bike and i do all the um weight machines and some free weights 

561.16 562.11 A: uh-huh 

566.03 568.02 A: wow that's kind of amazing 

566.53 567.53 B: so 

567.62 568.95 B: yeah it's and 

568.10 572.66 A: that's way more than i do [laughter] i'd like to i'd like to say i did that much 

569.82 580.65 B: i i have a little more time to do that you know than you probably i only working twenty hours a week and i've worked forty forty five before but now i'm down to twenty hours a week so 

577.70 578.60 A: uh-huh 

580.61 585.40 B: that makes a difference and we realize our important life is and how short it is so 

585.42 589.86 B: you might as well do what you like and be with people that you like also 

589.95 599.89 A: absolutely absolutely yes i mean and it it's equally important like we were saying just about exercising the mind as your body because uh it uh you know it'll 

590.36 591.00 B: so 

596.90 598.25 B: mhm
