501.77 502.84 A: (( mhm [noise] the only thing )) 

503.18 509.00 A: (( the only thing is the seat is so damned uncomfy and i [laughter] god [sigh] [noise] [laughter] )) 

506.80 518.21 B: yeah i know they say and i was reading this book that said you got to position the seat just right and i was like well i don't know if i [laughter] i don't have a right position i'm just gonna have to learn to be uncomfortable on it 

517.93 518.83 A: yeah 

518.42 521.62 B: yeah it's it is pretty uncomfortable any bike i've been on 

519.69 529.00 A: 'cause i know my brother he bought you know like a gel fill that didn't you know wasn't real great and you know i mean he never i don't think he's really found the perfect solution [mn] 

525.52 527.17 B: right 

528.95 529.87 B: mhm 

529.57 533.34 A: now i have found the perfect solution to bicyl- bicycling 

533.67 537.05 A: [mn] you go in the gym and you do the recumbent bicycle 

533.74 534.58 B: what is it 

535.31 538.84 B: (( [laughter] )) 

537.35 542.93 A: (( [laughter] big bucket seat like in a car yay there there's my [sigh] you know )) 

538.93 539.91 B: right 

540.50 548.50 B: [laughter] if they only made real bikes like i guess they do [mn] might have real bikes like that but i don't know how i'd like [mn] looking 

544.75 545.57 A: (( well yeah well )) 

547.11 548.21 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

548.63 551.56 B: like that [laughter] riding the bike around the neighborhood 

549.34 550.49 A: no i think 

550.80 554.25 A: right i think you'd [mn] defeat your own purpose [laughter] 

553.41 555.46 B: (( mm [laughter] )) 

555.86 561.41 B: um so what was the other question do you think everybody has a hobby was that it

562.33 562.90 B: (( [mn] )) 

563.24 566.90 B: i think [mn] well i think everybody has one thing that they kind of 

566.97 568.04 B: you know 

567.91 568.97 A: (( yeah [noise] [mn] )) 

568.46 577.92 B: like doing a whole lot and then there's probably one thing that people do more than any other thing you know in their life or whatever i don't know if yet they might not intentionally call it a hobby right 

574.74 575.47 A: they 

576.53 588.57 A: right that when i heard the question that was kind of my reaction [mn] i think you know because have a hobby [mn] kinda gets that thing oh my god i'm supposed to run out and buy forty seven yards of [mn] 

588.43 592.24 A: of yarn and forty two knitting needles and make afgha- you know 

591.59 593.45 B: (( mhm )) 

592.50 595.36 A: in other words [mn] but i you know like mm 

595.47 599.90 A: but i think like they sa- [mn] like you say is that you know everybody has something they like to
