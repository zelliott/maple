0.15 1.75 B: hi i'm danny 

2.81 4.45 A: hello i'm matt 

8.45 10.29 B: so are we supposed to start talk 

9.50 12.91 A: oh are we talking man [laughter] [laughter] okay 

10.59 12.08 B: i i don't know 

12.56 14.70 B: so do you think those programs work 

14.08 15.21 A: um 

16.17 22.34 A: yeah let's see well obviously they've had a big effect on in america i guess 'cause i lived in europe for a couple of years 

22.35 25.53 A: and they still smoke a lot a lot more over there so i've seen 

24.42 25.83 B: more over there 

25.61 28.57 A: oh yeah in france at least 

26.68 27.68 B: really 

28.31 31.93 B: it seems like everybody's smarter over there they wouldn't they would know not to smoke 

31.30 34.10 A: [laughter] well i don't know 

34.36 35.78 A: i think um 

36.35 43.35 A: oh okay i'll tell you what my opinion on all that stuff is like [mn] all of a sudden they're attacking all the tobacco companies 

42.90 43.95 B: uh-huh 

43.98 45.23 A: um 

45.84 55.04 A: i think it's kind of a double standard because they they're like attacking all these cigarette companies whereas 

55.15 56.79 A: and like there 

56.87 61.92 A: there uh ad campaigns and everything they're saying like oh they're targeting you know 

62.65 68.90 A: they're targeting youth and things like that and they're making smoking look good and everything like that 

65.17 66.15 B: uh-huh 

68.87 78.18 A: but then if you like consider the number of people that die in like automo- automobile accidents from drinking beer 

78.31 84.34 A: like you'd see that like the numbers are pretty similar as far as deaths related to like the two 

84.81 87.38 B: consumption of some sort of 

84.89 89.87 A: um yeah some sort of or like just getting drunk and end up 

90.21 91.98 A: getting in crashes and stuff 

91.64 93.33 B: yeah it's definitely double 

92.15 95.26 A: well i was thinking they should also attack 

95.53 98.30 A: um you know just to 

98.31 99.71 A: be consistent [mn] 

99.58 103.86 B: yeah or anywhere they could just let people do whatever they want you know 

103.48 105.72 A: yeah or yeah [laughter] 

104.85 106.81 B: [laughter] it seems like 

106.98 116.81 B: [lipsmack] i don't know my problem i i re- i don't like the uh the most of the stuff they do to keep kids from smoking 'cause i feel like it's [mn] it's not as effective as it could be 

116.44 117.38 A: uh-huh 

116.82 121.61 B: and i feel like it's usually pretty condescending like they net- like they they really 

122.04 125.84 B: like uh the the the ads i've seen on t._v. and stuff 

125.51 126.53 A: mhm 

125.80 139.78 B: seem to seem to really try to make it seem cool not to smoke as opposed to telling people like why they why they shouldn't smoke like they just they're just like oh you don't want to do that it's not cool anymore like 

130.82 131.78 A: yeah 

139.54 140.59 A: yeah 

139.64 143.92 B: it's uh it's just uh i mean it's doing the exact same thing that like ads 

144.30 148.16 B: trying to get people to smoke are doing and there's there's really no information 

148.91 150.20 A: mhm 

149.53 151.31 B: that's what i don't like 

150.71 158.16 A: oh yeah that is kind of true 'cause like you see the commercials with like kids that have like fifteen tattoos and like 

158.34 167.02 A: nose like or their ears are pierced or like the guys have their ears pierced and their nose rings and everything and they're like i don't smoke [laughter] 

166.27 167.71 B: yeah 

167.58 172.03 A: and you're like oh well [laughter] i bet you do other things but [laughter] 

169.24 170.63 B: [laughter] well 

171.37 173.03 B: [laughter] 

173.46 175.57 B: yeah 

174.50 177.05 A: but uh yeah actually i'm even 

177.78 184.27 A: uh [mn] i'm not sure i haven't really thought about that that much though like the actual how effective it has or mhm mhm 

183.65 195.26 B: yeah i don't i i don't know i i think i think that there's some good ideas behind them but i think that it's it's hard they they can't afford to be too consistent with like attacking teen smoking because 

195.41 202.19 B: i mean they the cigarette companies lobby the government and stuff the cigarette companies like aren't 

202.59 210.60 B: like aren't the enemy of the government or anything like that they're they're just a s- sort of a scapegoat in some instances 

211.67 213.23 B: (( and [mn] yeah )) 

212.27 216.35 A: yeah what what i wondered is why all of a sudden it happened like 

216.99 220.53 A: it was like no one was really attacking 'em until 

220.72 222.58 A: around five years ago 

223.15 231.66 A: and then all of a sudden the government really decided they were going to attack 'em and actually i i [mn] noticed it's worked a lot because 

232.23 234.51 A: um a lot less people smoke now [mn] 

234.86 236.49 B: really i see 

235.33 236.29 A: (( but )) 

237.01 238.65 B: i don't know i i 

239.05 244.14 B: i guess now that you mention it i have noticed that that's pretty interesting so do you smoke 

242.88 246.53 A: like oh actually it worked when you think about it it did work because 

246.74 251.37 A: like the opinion of smoking now i've no- it's like changed and 

250.90 252.96 B: yeah i gu- i guess that's true 

254.05 261.53 B: yeah it's it's weird to think about very weird but i mean there's still kids who smoke though i mean 

260.90 261.91 A: yeah 

262.55 265.50 B: that's interesting to me like it's like 

266.83 275.86 B: like it kind of makes sense to me that people would start smoking like a while back when it was like cooler but now now if if there's it's like opinion has changed so like 

276.66 282.31 B: i wonder i wonder what makes kids want to start smoking now if it's it's supposed to not be cool anymore 

283.93 289.35 A: yeah i guess it [mn] hasn't completely left like 

289.84 292.66 A: (( still like a little bit cool maybe i don't know [laughter] but )) 

292.23 296.35 B: yeah [laughter] so do you smoke 

295.73 298.43 A: no i've actually never smoked no 

296.80 299.47 B: yeah yeah me neither 

299.57 300.62 B: i uh 

300.84 304.00 B: i definitely know a lot of people who have smoked though 

305.01 306.09 B: [sigh] 

305.06 306.54 A: yeah i've a 

307.37 311.05 A: i was pressured to smoke like a couple of times but i never did 

310.94 312.94 B: mhm 

312.04 316.60 A: and that's how like yeah i can tell kids would still do it 'cause like 

316.80 319.11 A: even though they know it's destructive 

319.83 322.79 A: it's just something that kids do [laughter] 

323.07 325.11 B: yeah 

323.75 327.82 A: i can remember in just in elementary school kids'd start smoking 

328.06 329.56 A: (( it's kind of crazy but )) 

328.24 329.38 B: wow 

331.57 334.07 B: that's intense elementary school 

333.34 334.96 A: (( [laughter] i know )) 

334.67 342.28 B: so uh uh do you think they i wonder if they they show those no non smoking ads like on like saturday morning cartoons and stuff [laughter] 

341.48 345.98 A: oh yeah [laughter] yeah that that's where they should start i guess [laughter] 

345.55 348.17 B: [mn] [laughter] 

348.99 353.60 A: well i know where i'm from they smoke a lot more than the national average i'm like from the south 

353.43 356.42 B: uh where do you where are you from in the south 

354.09 355.15 A: and so 

355.76 358.64 A: in virginia like southern virginia [mn] 

357.92 359.10 B: yeah right on 

359.94 361.92 A: but right now i'm in utah 

362.38 366.54 A: and it's like no one smokes 

366.22 367.40 B: yeah 

366.75 368.66 A: it's amazing like 

369.10 377.33 A: it's [mn] i've only seen three or four i've been here for almost a year i've seriously in the town that i'm in i've only seen like four or five people smoke [laughter] 

376.69 378.90 B: wow that's crazy 

378.51 379.41 A: [mn] 

380.07 380.90 A: (( but )) 

381.55 382.69 B: wow 

383.06 385.37 B: i wonder hm 

386.19 387.72 A: (( let's see )) 

387.14 388.83 B: i wonder why that is 

389.26 393.80 A: oh well here it's because of the influence of the ch- of the mormon church so [mn] 

393.29 396.38 B: uh are you mormon is that why you moved out there 

395.13 397.80 A: yeah mhm 

396.72 397.60 B: huh 

397.83 399.51 B: that's interesting 

398.05 399.25 A: no one smokes 

401.09 405.97 A: but and it's like if you smoke here it's so out of the ordinary that it's like 

406.32 408.15 A: you kind of really put 

408.86 411.27 A: it's like you really bring attention to yourself you know 

411.07 412.04 B: uh-huh 

411.73 413.94 A: you have to really be different to smoke 

413.46 415.12 B: [laughter] that's really funny 

415.21 416.58 A: (( but [laughter] )) 

416.61 418.39 B: that's really interesting 

418.57 421.88 B: so it's it but it's really big in virginia 

421.79 426.75 A: yeah well in southern southern virginia at least i don't know about northern virginia because it's more 

427.25 433.29 A: they're more educated and stuff but southern virginia it's just 

433.61 436.48 A: i think the poorer class smokes more 

436.82 438.33 B: yeah 

437.80 441.95 A: like i think the south is known to have people that are more overweight 

441.84 442.80 B: uh-huh 

442.08 449.83 A: and [laughter] people that smoke more [laughter] not like the best thing to be known for but [laughter] 

444.57 445.72 B: yeah 

449.17 451.66 B: yeah it's weird i wonder i wonder 

451.70 452.72 B: (( mm i )) 

453.05 455.68 B: wonder why poorer people would smoke more 

456.77 461.39 B: it seems like they would have less money to spend on cigarettes 

460.62 462.56 A: yeah that's true 

462.72 467.11 B: or maybe maybe that's why they're poor [laughter] 

464.86 466.22 A: yeah [laughter] 

467.04 468.31 A: like 

468.38 474.06 A: i guess they just don't want to maybe they don't want to accept their situation or something so they try to escape with smoking i don't know 

474.21 475.65 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

474.97 483.53 A: but uh yeah we talked about that in economics i had a economics class and the taxes that the government wants to put on smoking or they have put on smoking 

483.82 489.28 A: like ends up really hurting even like the [mn] really poor class because 

489.35 491.35 A: they can't stop smoking 

491.45 493.77 A: and they just have to pay more for their cigarettes now [mn] 

493.88 495.15 B: oh wow 

495.23 497.99 B: i hadn't even thought about that 

497.56 499.48 A: yeah it's kind of interesting 

499.87 501.88 B: that is interesting i wonder 

500.60 504.92 A: but smoking is one of things like even if you tax more people will still do it you know but 

504.57 507.41 B: yeah that's true 

508.29 513.73 B: that's really weird i wonder i wonder how much you'd have to tax a cigarette like how much is a 

514.00 520.60 B: a box of cigarettes or whatever a pack of cigarettes would would have to cost for people not to smoke 

519.17 521.50 A: (( yeah that is a good question )) 

521.32 522.65 B: probably a lot 

522.88 525.00 A: yeah th- i know that actually in 

525.14 528.55 A: one state i think it's i think it might be new york 

528.84 536.39 A: or new jersey maybe they completely i mean they tax 'em like crazy like a couple like three or four bucks for each pack 

536.03 537.11 B: (( mhm wow )) 

536.99 540.50 A: so like a pack of cigarettes cost like five bucks now or six bucks 

540.21 541.29 B: wow 

540.96 546.57 A: and so with that that's just encouraging people to go and 

546.91 553.72 A: like buy 'em from indian reservations like kind of illegally or get them from somewhere else and then bring 'em back 

550.63 551.76 B: (( uh [laughter] )) 

553.59 556.04 B: and then sell 'em for cheaper [laughter] 

555.11 559.01 A: yeah [laughter] it's like the whole black market but 

556.16 557.58 B: that's funny 

559.29 563.34 B: [laughter] black market cigarettes that's really crazy to me 

560.49 562.31 A: [laughter] 

563.14 563.91 A: but 

564.01 564.96 B: (( wow )) 

564.92 567.94 A: so i [mn] do they tell us when the ten minutes is over 

567.44 570.28 B: yeah they're supposed to [mn] the 

569.02 570.64 A: (( or have you done this before okay )) 

570.33 571.96 B: i haven't done it before 

573.72 577.21 B: yeah i should just i should wear a watch next time 

576.47 577.58 A: [laughter] 

578.72 581.35 A: um let me think anything else about cigarettes 

581.05 586.15 B: [laughter] yeah it's i mean there's there's so much you can say about talking um 

584.34 585.35 A: [laughter] 

587.13 588.20 B: i don't know 

587.35 590.71 A: my mom she quit smoking when she was like twenty two 

590.82 594.88 B: that's cool it seems like quitting is a really hard part about smoking 

594.41 595.28 A: yeah 

595.25 599.89 B: they [mn] did she like uh did she just stop smoking all together
