92.34 102.00 A: do that but i i've done it for years for my own enjoyment and haven't really wanted rejection [laughter] so it seems safer just enjoying it for myself 

97.74 99.31 B: [laughter] 

102.72 105.29 B: well it might be something to think about though 

102.86 103.66 A: um 

104.94 113.41 A: yeah it's just that i've i've felt i heard one of the the topics to discuss was you know do you feel everyone needs a hobby and i i certainly do and that's 

113.49 117.27 A: my one of my frustrations in being a parent of two little ones is um 

117.45 121.32 A: i've had or i've allowed myself really no time for 

121.43 124.01 A: my hobby in the last couple of years 

124.46 126.86 A: you know which is very uh frustrating to me uh 

128.35 130.22 A: it's nice to have a diversion 

130.50 132.88 B: yeah all things pass though 

132.49 134.31 A: yeah yeah 

133.64 135.93 B: how small are your children well

144.30 147.59 A: so doesn't leave us much time for much of anything 

148.03 150.86 A: your your hobby refunding is that a 

151.05 154.89 A: how much time i mean do you spend a [mn] you said you spend a lot of time on it 

155.22 156.21 B: (( [mn] [mn] oh )) 

157.79 162.94 B: it ebbs and flows but i'd say it averages about two hours a day 

162.44 163.50 A: wow 

165.02 166.26 A: and um 

165.77 168.93 B: and that doesn't include the shopping in the stores 

168.29 169.29 A: sure

179.73 186.21 B: yeah i've been doing it since well 'bout nineteen seventy eight it's grown since then 

186.77 190.20 B: the whole thing has expanded into a lot of different things 

190.01 199.81 A: [laughter] so if someone were to start in your hobby they they don't do they need any special knowledge or any materials or is it just [mn] things that we'd find in our newspapers and our you know coupons 

198.81 205.08 B: yeah newspapers and the pads in the grocery stores or or uh magazines 

202.89 204.00 A: so nothing
