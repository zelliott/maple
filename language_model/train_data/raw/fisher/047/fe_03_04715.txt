59.20 74.10 B: um not yet so far you know i i started it 'cause i i just love the purses [laughter] and 'cause i can justify buying more that way [laughter] um and then now i'm doing a lot of charity work so i'm selling them

68.32 70.43 A: oh okay okay okay 

74.07 84.89 B: with the proceeds going to charity and then they don't you know if i don't make money on them it's not quite so big of a deal [laughter] but um no i haven't gone into business for myself yet

94.00 96.28 A: is that where you sell most of your purses 

95.97 103.75 B: yeah i try to [laughter] but i buy a lot of them too unfortunately there's a lot of fakes out there that's surprising 

97.43 98.94 A: oh okay okay 

101.02 101.98 A: (( oh okay )) 

103.46 110.27 A: yeah that is true 'cause it's kinda hard some um a lot of stuff is kinda hard to tell a fake from an authentic you know 

110.03 112.25 B: right e- absolutely 

112.71 113.82 B: y- i 

112.84 115.28 A: but people just take advantage of it so 

115.12 120.62 B: it's surprising that you know to say that there are people [laughter] other people like me in the world but um 

117.93 119.05 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

120.33 120.96 A: (( [noise] )) 

120.87 127.90 B: you know that [mn] that even people that really know what they're talking about and what they're looking at are sometimes fooled by some of those ebay auctions 

127.47 128.64 A: mhm 

127.94 133.57 B: until they get the the thing [noise] in their hot little hands and then think uh-huh shit i got taken [laughter] 

131.25 132.07 A: then 

132.14 140.80 A: then yeah then that's the only time they can really tell once they already actually touched it [noise] i guess that's the problem with online buying but it's a risk you take but 

134.83 135.83 B: yeah 

136.33 137.28 B: right 

140.03 142.10 B: yeah sure [noise] 

141.57 146.20 A: but if someone a friend of mine always says this if it's too good to be true it usually is but 

142.46 143.48 B: [noise] 

145.62 146.79 B: (( right [noise] )) 

146.47 148.76 A: on the other hand 

148.86 150.76 A: it is kinda hard to say 

150.80 158.35 B: but then again you know i've i've had auctions where i've lost money before you know so there's times where as a buyer you know 

154.92 155.75 A: uh-huh 

158.37 163.52 B: you want to say if it's too good to be true it probably is but sometimes you get lucky [laughter] 

163.30 165.35 A: yeah you're right 

163.96 165.29 B: (( so [noise] )) 

165.79 167.49 B: do you have any other hobbies
