523.52 524.74 A: (( know every once in a while )) 

531.72 539.84 B: [mn] 'cause when i used to do the cross stitch i mean i tried to pick it up when i was a kid i didn't have the patience and then years later i i actually became very good at it [mn] 

540.25 542.59 B: when i was prepared to actually 

542.78 545.22 B: do it you know [mn] 

544.40 553.78 A: but i don't really [noise] okay going to make a lamp with it oh yeah [mn] right [noise] [mn] well i was really good at that stuff when i was a kid and i just stopped doing it for years and years i i used to be able to braid and everything but i just 

546.52 547.52 B: hello

565.83 566.89 B: (( mhm )) 

567.83 582.67 B: [noise] see i always figured it was one of those things that you wouldn't get a really good result right away and i would just lose patience with it and give up and that's i i guess that's the problem with a lot of these things if you [mn] tend to be a perfectionist and you and you tend to be impatience [mn] you know you don't get a good result you know 

583.05 584.51 B: why stick with it 

584.76 585.71 B: yeah 

585.70 599.95 B: um though i had a friend who took one ceramics class when we were in college and within weeks you know she was making these gorgeous vases and plates and her glaze was perfect and the shapes were perfect and -d say how do you do that
