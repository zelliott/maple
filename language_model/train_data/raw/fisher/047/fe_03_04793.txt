108.58 113.04 A: yeah yeah i i get i get you yeah i understand what you're saying yeah yeah 

112.84 124.87 A: it seems that uh many of the place many of the bars here because they've just brought it into effect here that th- uh you can't smoke in a bar [sigh] that many of the bars are ignoring the uh the rule and uh just sort of turning a blind eye 

124.19 129.30 B: hm [mn] well it it's not that bad here that's for sure 

124.93 126.69 A: i don't know how it is out there [lipsmack] 

129.16 131.54 A: i see yeah 

129.81 135.48 B: um yeah basically i don't think anyone would pay attention to it you know 

134.62 137.42 A: the bar the the bars don't pay attention to it 

136.86 140.28 B: (( oh no n- uh out here they wouldn't i i know that for sure )) 

137.51 138.38 A: no 

139.00 142.78 A: they wouldn't yeah yeah is it against the law to smoke in a bar there 

142.72 148.22 B: [mn] no no no in a like in restaurants you have a smoking section and a non smoking section sure 

143.30 144.48 A: oh it's not 

146.31 155.57 A: oh really oh okay well they've banned they've banned all of that completely they've banned it completely uh here as in bars restaurants everything that you can't there there is no smoke 

155.61 161.41 B: [mn] i i think that's really um an infringement on someone's rights 

161.28 170.04 A: well it is and many of the many of the people are i guess justifiably are very upset about this those that smoke and uh you see them outside uh in the winter particularly sh- 

166.67 167.41 B: yeah 

170.33 174.34 A: outside the door it's uh [laughter] yeah 

171.32 172.12 B: yeah 

172.53 173.26 B: yeah 

173.29 182.98 B: so you know uh basically you know 'cause before you look at the way it was thirty years ago you know uh when smoking was much more popular you know and and the the uh 

183.00 186.98 B: other people were on the outside you now you could smoke anywhere you want to at work or you know 

186.56 187.28 A: yeah 

187.10 191.86 B: and i i think that they just take it a probably a good idea just a little bit too far 

192.22 199.81 A: yeah yeah i i i probably agree with you yeah had you smoked at one time no oh never oh okay i used to s- yeah 

192.40 193.57 B: (( [noise] yeah ))
