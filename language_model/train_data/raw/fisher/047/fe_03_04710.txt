26.91 27.91 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

28.28 41.04 A: i don't think i've ever had a hobby i i've tried like collecting baseball cards and stuff when i was a kid that didn't pan out tried uh comics books that didn't pan out i think the only thing that i can really call a hobby is like watching t._v. 

33.83 34.98 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

40.82 42.16 B: (( oh da- [laughter] )) 

41.19 43.58 A: (( [laughter] )) 

42.30 44.93 B: [mn] i excel at that hobby

47.90 49.87 B: i was in pennsylvania 

49.47 50.49 A: okay 

50.05 52.44 B: but i live in atlanta georgia now 

52.06 54.41 A: oh really yeah i went to uh emery 

53.96 56.06 B: oh really i go to georgia tech 

55.27 67.24 A: okay yeah so yeah that'd be a good hobby at at tech is to watch t._v. that was pretty much [mn] well actually i didn't watch a lot of t._v. in college i don't know what my hobby was back then i guess i just hung out with people but 

60.06 61.15 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

66.18 69.62 B: [noise] yeah there's always people around you know so 

69.67 70.93 A: (( yeah yeah so i ))

74.33 75.13 A: yeah 

74.46 78.53 B: but i don't know if that's always because i want to or because i have to [laughter] [mn] 

77.94 82.06 A: yeah yeah i never could really get into h- 

82.41 84.21 A: (( hobbies per se )) 

84.27 98.69 B: there's nothing i really wanna uh like pursue like there's nothing i'm really like i mean i guess depends i guess what you define as a hobby but you said like -aseball cards and stuff i did that when i was younger but [noise] [mn] that's not something i'd want to invest money into now [laughter] 

97.96 101.93 A: right [mn] w- well how do you define a hobby [noise] 

101.29 107.49 B: [mn] yeah that's what i'm saying like it's i i i have no idea how you'd say it i mean i guess it would just be something that you enjoy doing [mn] 

106.79 108.49 A: right 

107.75 116.62 B: but i mean i enjoy doing a whole i mean we had a [mn] keg party at my house the other day that was enjoying but i wouldn't call that a hobby per se [laughter] 

112.28 113.69 A: [laughter] 

116.70 129.94 A: yeah you probably don't want to call that a hobby [laughter] yeah yeah [mn] i think like the definition of hobby is you know just something you do to to pass time that's enjoyable 

118.40 121.40 B: (( [laughter] so [mn] )) 

129.53 130.72 B: yeah

299.76 311.61 A: i didn't play when i was a kid 'cause my brother and all his friends were so much better than i was i was like the person who'd get the control for like ten seconds and then hand it over to the next guy but you know now that i live alone i bought like a p._s. two 

307.12 308.20 B: yeah

350.76 354.39 A: [mn] do a lot of people at tech um play computer games 

354.09 368.50 B: i think so i'm not actually like i'm kinda like you i kinda suck at video games so i just don't really play them that often but i think a lot of k- yeah a lot of kids do you see ads around campus like you know to start like computer gaming groups and stuff [mn] 

357.98 359.80 A: mhm 

367.95 379.60 A: yeah 'cause i was i was looking at um laptops on the dell website today and it was like saying which which consoles or not com- but which like units were good [mn] for for gamers 

379.29 380.89 B: oh really [mn] 

379.49 387.15 A: so i uh only know that that term because i happened to see like this special on m._t._v. one night so otherwise i would have been lost but [noise] 

385.00 385.87 B: (( [laughter] )) 

386.54 387.40 B: [laughter] 

388.03 394.01 B: yeah no i think a lot of kids play a lot of video games here i think it's a pretty popular past time 

394.36 396.48 B: [mn] for a lot of people 

398.56 401.33 B: which is not too bad i guess something to do 

399.36 400.86 A: (( [noise] yeah yeah )) 

402.56 406.01 B: but no yeah p._s. two's good it's probably the best console 

406.94 413.08 A: d- do you know anyone i have like one friend who has an xbox he says that's pretty good actually my my older brother has an xbox too [mn] 

412.80 417.00 B: we had an xbox for a while but we played the playstation [mn] way more 

417.16 419.61 A: an- [mn] is that because it has more games or 

419.31 431.87 B: i i don't know like i i think the xbox uh i'm not real i guess apparently i'm not really hand eye coordinated either i don't really like the controller on the xbox it's got too much shit going on i'm just i like the playstation it's real simple 

427.01 427.93 A: okay 

431.49 433.35 A: yeah 

432.39 437.37 B: and also the games i mean we have like tons of games for the playstation but not very many

446.83 448.23 B: (( oh yeah [laughter] )) 

447.64 453.91 A: and there are complaints 'cause they say it's like too graphic and you know a lot of kids like little kids play video games so 

453.31 454.81 B: yeah 

454.62 459.32 A: i mean it's all about your target audience that's why they have ratings on them you know yeah 

458.13 463.23 B: yeah yeah wasn't like i can't imagine little kids playing grand theft auto [mn] but 

462.59 464.27 A: oh is that really graphic 

463.84 472.73 B: oh it's unbeliev- i mean you pick up prostitutes you [mn] you run like errands for the mob you blow peoples' heads off and it's very detailed [mn] 

473.91 477.75 B: real st- stealing cars and all that kinda stuff [noise] 

476.98 482.10 A: yeah yeah that's um that's why i like ghost recon i like like the first person shooter games

518.18 519.32 B: really 

518.67 520.62 A: then yeah so 

520.48 526.14 B: it kinda just got like spread around my campus someone did it on campus and then posted it for everyone else to do it 

525.45 526.35 A: (( right yeah )) 

526.21 528.05 B: 'cause like for me it's [mn] 

528.14 530.56 B: it's not really a big hassle and it's 

532.47 534.18 B: [mn] paying i guess

546.44 547.46 B: (( oh really )) 

548.13 557.12 A: i mean they're kind of the same but they were different you know so we like agreed on some terms so that that conversation actually went like really quickly and um 

550.82 551.88 B: yeah 

555.41 556.56 B: yeah 

557.32 562.91 A: then i had another one where [mn] that was like on schools or something so 

561.73 563.43 B: that's one i had too 

563.09 572.86 A: and that was a little bit slower 'cause the person i was talking to like the only thing she would say is like yes i agree and it it sounded like she was at work typing or something i don't know so 

569.16 570.32 B: (( oh really )) 

572.22 575.29 B: yeah trying to be secretive about what she's doing
