0.76 1.82 A: hello 

1.61 3.83 B: (( hello yeah )) 

3.20 5.71 A: yeah ah my name's andrew who's this 

5.32 8.05 B: my name's jim i live in california 

7.77 10.09 A: i live in california too wow i 

9.21 13.05 B: oh gee that's that's i spoke to somebody from new york 

10.30 11.34 A: maybe they're 

12.87 17.79 A: yeah ah so ah this is my first time doing this so ah i guess we're just supposed to 

16.27 19.69 B: yeah it's my second time so i don't know much about it either 

19.63 26.96 A: cool well um so i guess we're supposed to talk about the smoking thing um i'm ah what part of california are you in 

26.98 29.24 B: i'm in ah canoga park 

29.08 41.78 A: oh okay well i'm in sherman oaks so yeah the l._a. area ah 'cause i'm sure that our perspective on the the whole smoking ban thing is pretty different than you know people who live in other places in the country 

31.15 33.24 B: oh yeah 

41.94 44.25 A: (( um you know 'cause )) 

42.84 44.73 B: yeah why would you say that 

44.82 49.21 A: ah just because we you know we've had a smoking ban here 

49.42 50.99 A: you know for a while 

50.83 52.17 B: oh i'm new 

51.04 52.09 A: whereas 

52.65 54.04 A: oh you just got here 

53.55 56.78 B: yeah i i'm six moths out of pennsylvania 

56.70 62.70 A: oh wow okay yeah i i'm from back east myself um well welcome to l._a. 

59.98 61.01 B: yeah 

62.50 63.87 B: yeah thank you 

63.76 65.13 A: sure um 

65.37 73.24 A: so yeah i guess the reason i think it's you know kind of a different perspective is because you know when when they first put in the smoking ban here people were 

73.48 81.58 A: you know a lot of people were nervous that it was gonna hurt the restaurant business hurt the bar business and a lot of you know a lot of things that 

81.61 84.74 A: it didn't it ah i don't think it ended up hurting 

84.90 90.94 A: restaurant business at all but at first it looked like it was going to so probably that's why i say our perspective is probably different than 

91.09 93.54 A: you know people from other parts of the country 

92.74 96.02 B: well it's it's had it before and now they're trying to put it back 

96.94 102.31 A: ah no we have a we have smoking ban here you can't smoke in a restaurant anywhere in l._a. 

101.43 102.56 B: oh 

102.85 108.25 B: oh that's all restaurants there's no non smoking ah smoking area in the restaurants 

108.18 113.35 A: no yeah it's like ah yeah back east it's like you'll have the smoking section or the non smoking section 

112.75 114.22 B: yeah 

113.64 123.66 A: in l._a. um you can't have there isn't there is no smoking at all in a restaurant the only way they can have a smoking section is if there's like an outdoor patio 

123.90 133.33 A: and ah then they can have on at tables that are outdoors um but ah well what's your what's your perspective on it 

124.27 125.25 B: (( oh )) 

127.88 129.25 B: oh i see 

133.31 145.77 B: i think it's a good idea i'm i'm a guy that stopped smoking about ten years ago and ah [laughter] i got no complaints i um you know i don't miss it at all and um 

142.21 143.18 A: yeah 

145.94 148.74 B: i've been away from 'em ten years and um 

149.49 150.91 B: (( you know )) 

151.34 155.32 B: [mn] so much the better i ah i applied for um 

151.68 152.62 A: yeah 

156.55 160.12 B: ah term life insurance about six months ago 

160.11 161.54 A: oh yeah 

160.41 164.53 B: and the rates the rates for a non smoker were fifty percent le- 

164.84 168.83 B: of what ah they were for a smoker so that really um 

168.80 169.77 A: wow 

169.93 172.83 B: made me um more happy that i um 

173.35 177.21 B: i quit smoking so i i think it's a good idea it's um 

177.41 184.14 B: they they went on so much about second hand smoking ah being um harmful to others i 

183.47 184.46 A: yeah 

184.42 189.11 B: don't think it hurts i i i'd rather eat in a restaurant without the smoke 

184.59 185.53 A: yeah it 

185.65 186.48 A: yeah 

188.76 193.32 A: yeah that's that's my feeling i mean i i i quit smoking probably 

193.51 202.51 A: eight years ago i was never like a real heavy smoker but for a couple of years that for a couple of years there i was probably like a half a pack a day kind of smoker nothing like 

201.61 204.87 B: oh that's pretty low i smoked about a pack a day 

202.61 203.54 A: (( nothing really )) 

204.84 209.96 A: yeah i was never i was never up that high but um yeah my feeling about it 

209.73 223.14 A: you know ah i go to vegas a lot and in vegas you know they don't have the smoking ba- ban and you really notice it you know you go to a restaurant and you're trying to eat and you smell smoke and it really you know on- once you 

221.83 226.66 B: yeah if you're a non smoker it you sm- you smell it there's no two ways about it 

226.70 228.89 A: yeah and so 

228.88 236.65 A: um yeah i mean i'm i i like the ban i mean i think that people should be allowed to smoke but 

236.65 245.41 A: it should be up to them to do it at a place that it doesn't interfere with ah with pe- with non smokers you know what i mean it's like if if you wanna smoke it's sort of 

243.25 244.40 B: yeah 

245.25 253.08 A: my perspective is it's kind of that's your thing but you need to find a place to do that doesn't interfere with you know other people's 

253.39 268.13 A: life um i the only other thing is i i guess i sort of feel like if a bar wants to have a smoking room where they can keep it completely like like sort of air sealed so that the 

254.03 255.11 B: yeah 

268.38 275.06 A: it you know that it doesn't the smoke doesn't get get into the other side they should be allowed to do that f- for a bar 

270.39 271.72 B: yeah 

275.20 288.48 A: but i guess their their argument for why they didn't do that is that the people who work there don't have a choice you know a waitress doesn't doesn't have choice and so then she's like subjected to the smoke i guess that's sort of what their reasoning was 

288.30 289.38 B: yeah 

288.52 296.98 A: um [lipsmack] but i i mean i sort of feel like it's well especially in southern california having people be allowed to smoke outside 

296.83 308.83 A: you know it's most of the time it's fine to go outside here i mean i guess it would be different in like boston or new york where in the winter it's freezing outside so that probably makes a difference 

306.07 307.86 B: yeah 

309.05 312.59 A: um but ah it's all what part of 

311.38 316.17 B: well i guess the only people that oppose it are those that worry about infringement on our rights 

316.97 319.16 A: yeah and i you know i 

317.82 325.99 B: but um the way that ah the um the bill for ah taking care of smokers in a hospital is going up so much 

326.07 327.06 A: yeah 

326.58 329.57 B: maybe it's a good thing they are banning it 

330.22 332.83 A: yeah i i guess i sort of feel like 

332.86 333.81 A: you know 

333.88 337.89 A: people should be i i don't like the idea of like banning smoking 

337.91 343.44 A: you know illegalizing smoking or something like that i think people should be allowed to smoke i just sort of feel like 

343.49 351.58 A: they need to do it some place that isn't public you know you should be you know it's like a thing that has to happen in private um 

347.68 348.72 B: yeah 

350.59 351.58 B: right 

351.68 365.84 A: and you know the other concern at the beginning was i thought well you know if a restaurant owner's business is gonna be hurt by you know a smoking ban then they should be allowed to have a smoking section but 

365.87 367.27 A: they've you know 

367.50 373.01 A: they've pretty much proven that if anything you know it it helps 

373.06 377.10 A: the business because there's a lot of people ah you know there's 

374.05 375.17 B: yeah 

377.17 379.43 A: ah there's a lot of pe- people who 

379.60 381.71 A: um don't smoke 

381.96 386.62 A: ah you know and don't wanna go to a restaurant where there's gonna be smoke i mean 

386.44 387.61 B: yeah 

386.49 396.93 A: when i'm in vegas when i'm in vegas with my girlfriend and you know smoke bothers her more than it bothers me um we you know there are certain restaurants where it's like [mn] i don't wanna got here it's smokey 

396.75 411.31 A: and so we e- we won't go there um but if there's a ban across the board i mean people who smoke it's not like they're gonna say i'm never gonna go out to eat anymore because i can't smoke there it's like you you know you smoke outside before you eat or after you eat 

398.55 399.58 B: yeah 

411.39 412.39 A: um 

411.51 420.64 B: yeah i mean most smoking is um i mean most of the people i ran into smoke or when i smoked i always wanted to quit 

413.33 414.78 A: so yeah 

420.96 421.85 A: yeah 

421.43 430.08 B: you know and i needed some help and maybe this is the help somebody needs to ah say hey i can get along without a cigarette for five hours or something like that 

429.91 443.12 A: yeah that's actually a really good point it's like you know so much of smoking is a kind of a social thing and when i was smoking it'd be i'd be out at a bar with my friends and you know people are smoking so i would light up you know and it just sort of becomes 

434.93 436.16 B: yeah 

443.30 448.30 A: a habit of that you know and if if you remove smoking from those situations then 

448.21 462.98 A: yeah that would probably help people quit i mean i guess part of the reason i'm against it that you can enforce smoking ban is just kind of selfish i like to be able to you know go places and not have to breathe smoke so it's just kind of a selfish thing i guess but 

462.89 466.62 A: you know if somebody's got to be selfish and i guess you know 

466.92 475.25 A: you know one side is gonna have to be comfortable and one side's gonna have to be uncomfortable but i guess i sort of feel like um 

474.49 478.65 B: yeah it's it's not gonna hurt anybody to go without a cigarette for 

478.75 489.48 B: ah for four hours that's my outlook on it and i think it does the it's it's good for the general welfare in the sense that that too many people are winding up with their lungs going after sixty 

481.77 482.96 A: (( if yeah )) 

489.65 492.69 A: yeah and i guess i sort of feel like when you have a 

492.54 495.35 A: an issue where there's two pe- two sides 

495.20 508.08 A: and one you know one one side is gonna be comfortable and the other side's gonna be uncomfortable i sort of feel like well smoking is something you know you smoke and it makes me uncomfortable it sort of infringes on another person's deal whereas 

506.60 507.91 B: right yeah 

507.89 511.57 A: you know my clean air doesn't really infringe on 

511.75 525.90 A: the right of the smoker so i i guess that's sort of why i'm for the ban but ah but i i will tell you that i've spent some time in other places outside of l._a. where they've talked about smoking ban and people are pretty against it um 

526.01 537.46 A: you know ah they've talked about there [mn] there was talk about doing it in atlanta and people were really against it there and um i know that people really were pretty unhappy about doing it in new york 

532.23 533.25 B: yeah 

537.51 547.13 A: but um you know when it first came along in l._a. i think there was a lot of grumbling and then you know it's worked out really well so you know 

546.98 553.44 B: yeah [mn] as a matter of fact i've been here six months and ah i didn't realise that there was 

553.86 566.09 B: a no smoking ban until you mentioned it you know i've been in restaurants and now that i recall i haven't been in a restaurant where a waitress asked me if she wanted smoking or non i want smoking or non smoking 

565.47 570.75 A: yeah yeah it doesn't even occur to you that if if you were a smoker it would occur to you but yeah it's ah 

568.04 569.13 B: yeah 

569.77 571.45 B: yeah 

570.83 582.28 A: um yeah you'll probably notice it now it's like you just go into a restaurant there's never you're never breathing any smoke you know and it or it they don't do the whole thing ah oh a table for two okay smoking or not you know they just 

576.96 578.19 B: yeah 

581.06 583.18 B: yeah 

582.66 591.87 A: um yeah it's kind of kind of interesting i don't know if it's all of california or if it's just um just um l._a. or l._a. cou- i know it's 

592.12 593.82 A: maybe l._a. county 

593.96 599.89 A: ah i'm not sure like how much of the like where the ban covers or it might be the whole state of califor-
