13.50 14.54 B: oh okay 

14.63 16.56 B: yeah i've never smoked ah 

17.56 21.16 A: so what do you think you think they should ban it in public places 

21.10 26.86 B: um in public places i mean indoors i i i i think so 

26.78 27.77 A: uh-huh 

27.11 36.20 B: i'm i'm okay with ah what new york and florida are doing and california are doing with ah banning smoking indoors 

36.03 38.14 A: what about like at a bar though 

38.45 44.65 A: i mean i you you would think that you'd be able to smoke in a bar i can maybe see like a restaurant you know you're eating 

44.07 54.13 B: right well i mean having been to both types now i mean obviously we've you know both been to like plenty of bars i've ah you know i'm used to you know 

54.18 58.79 B: smoking at a bar and people smoking away however at the same time 

59.25 63.05 B: i do- also like the fact that i can come home and not smell 

63.51 77.48 B: like cigarettes and then have to you know super wash all the clothes or you know frebreeze everything just because you know people are smoking um i mean i think it's a a good thing you know i wouldn't mind seeing you know maybe just a 

65.67 66.63 A: yeah 

77.59 79.73 B: you know a completely 

79.81 86.16 B: designated non smoking areas in a bar per se and also allow smoking but [mn] 

82.43 83.38 A: mhm 

86.36 91.04 B: i don't know i i it might be a little much for the government to start dictating all that stuff 

90.45 97.70 A: yeah i mean if a place is too smokey i just won't go i mean that's kind of my i mean i don't like the smoke either but 

97.78 108.95 A: i don't know like what you just said i think if you open a bar or really even a restaurant anything you should be able to let people smoke i just don't know that it's the government's place though 

109.35 117.95 A: you know i mean yeah i guess maybe public areas you know government owned areas i could see but if you have a private establishment 

117.58 121.07 B: yeah i mean like yeah i mean i could see both ways i mean 

121.33 129.95 B: if voters vote to allow it though you know which which they have in new york then oh you have to [laughter] 

123.93 124.85 A: yeah 

127.41 129.20 A: oh well 

129.23 131.95 A: yeah it doesn't really affect me that much so 

131.77 137.76 B: yeah nah nah same here i mean there is people smoke they smoke next to me no big deal 

137.82 140.79 B: i'm not too worried about it i just wash my clothes the next day 

140.48 141.57 A: yeah 

141.00 143.23 B: long as they're not breathing on me and you know 

143.38 145.48 B: then then it's all good 

145.28 147.99 A: yeah this is true so where do you live 

147.73 150.03 B: i live in ah in d._c. 

149.70 152.19 A: okay i'm down in tampa florida 

151.58 155.33 B: oh are you i'm actually moving to miami in a few months 

152.24 153.15 A: yeah 

154.73 156.15 A: oh are you really 

155.52 157.30 B: yeah going to law school 

157.28 159.89 A: oh cool what school 

158.48 159.40 B: yeah 

159.55 162.26 B: miami university 

160.43 161.45 A: (( nice )) 

162.37 168.73 A: you know i've been in florida for about let's see here twenty six years and i've never been to miami 

168.13 170.46 B: (( oh right that's where i was born and raised so )) 

169.94 171.11 A: (( oh okay )) 

170.61 172.70 B: been in tampa a few places [noise] 

173.40 181.61 B: ah so yeah is there like any sort of smoking laws in tampa 'cause i know in florida there isn't there some statewide measure that's going on 

174.89 175.95 A: in tampa 

181.08 191.75 A: yeah they um i think it passed on the ballot at the last election however i don't think that they've implemented it yet i don't know when it takes effect 

192.25 200.78 A: so yeah i mean 'cause i've been in plenty of places and people are still smoking but um i think some people have voluntarily already um 

200.71 207.62 A: instituted it but i don't really know all the details about it whether they're enforcing it yet or 

207.60 208.59 B: gotcha 

208.35 209.81 A: yeah so 

210.13 216.18 B: it's definitely changing environments they start one once more people start doing it in more municipalities 

217.01 221.46 A: yeah yeah i mean i don't know how it's gonna affect business and whatnot but um 

222.31 223.75 A: yeah i don't know 

223.79 229.93 B: yeah they're saying some business owners are saying like new york some are losing up to forty fifty percent of their business 

229.83 231.20 A: really 

230.58 233.30 B: that's what some people said yeah um 

233.73 239.27 B: meanwhile others are just rebutting by saying you know that the public the public health 

239.30 247.39 B: cost um with dealing all with dealing with all the smoke still outweighs what loss of revenue by the bars might have 

247.76 248.69 B: so 

248.39 250.00 A: yeah um 

250.18 253.60 A: well my question is well if it's banned everywhere then 

253.45 267.77 A: it's not like okay i'm not gonna go over to this establishment 'cause i can't smoke instead i'm going over here but if if it's banned for everyone i'm just kind of curious to know what those people are doing instead of saying go to a bar or a club 

267.81 270.87 B: ah probably just smoking outside i would think 

270.47 271.79 A: oh okay 

271.53 274.85 B: yeah 'cause that's how it's done now you just go outside into the street [mn] 

274.81 286.81 B: you smoke a couple and then you go back in and and you're fine or you know like the way it's done in in some places actually there is that you have you have like just a separate smoking like screened area 

286.32 287.31 A: uh-huh 

286.71 292.45 B: that's still kind of um indoors but it it's completely ventilated 

291.86 292.92 A: okay 

292.48 293.68 B: um 

294.23 295.35 B: [noise] you know 

295.63 301.76 B: that way people could have the choice of actually you know being in either area but still being in the bar and still getting served 

302.61 311.01 A: hm yeah i guess well i guess like in new york city that might not always be practical as far as constructing like a ventilated area 

303.75 304.46 B: which 

310.47 315.95 B: yeah exactly [laughter] definitely not ventilated i think new york has a little congestion 

311.78 314.47 A: (( hm )) 

315.96 316.95 A: (( ha )) 

317.62 320.24 A: that's cool so how long you been in d._c. 

319.66 321.40 B: ah about ten months 

321.25 322.42 A: (( oh okay )) 

322.88 324.43 A: what'd you go up there for 

324.48 331.31 B: um just for fun i i've lived in chicago for three years and decided i knew i'd be going to law school 

325.67 326.71 A: (( just for fun )) 

331.48 336.44 B: coming up so i decided i'd take you know the one year and go go somewhere else and ah 

336.77 341.58 B: i just got a couple of buddies living all over and we sort of all decided ah let's move to d._c. 

341.68 342.99 A: nice man 

342.35 343.74 B: so we did 

343.97 348.53 B: we rent out a house [sigh] and ah that's that and just enjoy ourselves 

348.71 351.82 A: cool what kind of um law do you wanna do 

351.69 356.01 B: [noise] [lipsmack] um i ah well i actually wanna go be a politician 

355.66 356.67 A: okay 

356.07 358.03 B: so um 

358.21 361.03 B: ah i'll probably most likely go 

361.07 367.35 B: um public ah you know pros- the prosecutions office and go state attorney something along those lines 

367.41 369.54 A: mhm 

368.69 370.97 B: [noise] so how old are you what do you do 

369.64 370.68 A: what part 

370.98 375.65 A: um well i was working for horizon doing software development 

375.28 376.23 B: uh-huh 

375.79 382.81 A: but i did that for two and half years and i was just getting really bored with it so i quit and now i trade from home 

382.66 385.70 B: oh really day trading very nice 

383.95 385.15 A: mhm 

385.46 391.33 A: so i just started that a couple of months ago and it's progressing slowly but it's going according to plan 

390.76 392.94 B: that's good so you're doing all right 

392.33 399.36 A: yeah well i mean i'm not yet profitable but i'm not really losing hardly any money because i'm trading really small 

398.75 399.91 B: (( ah there you go )) 

399.59 409.12 A: and um i just trade the s. and p. five hundred tracking stock with the intention once i get my performance up then i'll do the emini s. and p. future contract 

408.47 409.49 B: right 

409.56 414.20 A: and i got enough money to set aside for bills to last me like a year and a half so 

413.68 420.33 B: exactly that's the way to do it i'm actually i was a technical consultant for you know a firm called diamond cluster 

420.19 421.45 A: (( oh really which is you )) 

420.89 428.76 B: and ah yeah and then i got laid off last november ah 

423.59 424.53 A: (( know a competitor to like )) 

428.99 430.73 B: because of the economy and all 

430.35 431.32 A: (( accentra and stuff )) 

430.73 436.07 B: and ah yeah and i had actually saved up enough money while i was working um 

435.96 450.44 B: theoretically gonna be spending it on law school but instead i just been you know collecting unemployment since then and really just you know trying to find another job but at this point i'm just you know i'm just gonna take it easy i've gotten to be able to do any activity i've wanted to and just enjoy life 

450.10 451.21 A: (( mhm uh-huh mhm )) 

450.62 452.00 B: which is really nice 

451.65 453.15 A: oh that's real nice 

453.23 456.14 A: yeah i um i quit i 

456.21 467.89 A: i suppose i could've potentially waited and for a rift to occur and production to fall and then volunteered to get laid off but then i would've been able collect the unemployment but 

467.13 468.56 B: yeah 

467.97 474.04 A: i figure you know i'm quitting on my own will i'm not getting laid off there's no need to suck money from the government 

473.43 482.18 B: yeah yeah exactly i mean i i had moved to d._c. with the intention of eventually finding a job anyway so they just sort of beat me to the punch [laughter] 

481.45 482.82 A: (( [laughter] )) 

482.14 488.68 B: so i wasn't i wasn't too upset about it but i mean just finding another job was just too hard um 

487.89 489.42 A: yeah 

489.01 490.54 B: (( so i was just filling )) 

489.87 492.10 A: so what political party are you in 

491.51 494.28 B: i'm republican yeah yeah 

492.43 493.36 A: (( are you )) 

493.93 495.25 A: that's cool 

495.27 505.42 A: yeah i the more i think about it the more i'm definitely neither a um democrat or republican i'm kind of leaning more towards the libertarian party 

504.85 505.73 B: (( are you )) 

505.71 514.44 A: just because you know like the republicans bush got in office and it seems like he's done a lot of non conservative things like 

514.35 524.71 A: you know you have like all these farm subsidies and you know he's enacted a lot of economic policies that i think are kind of anti conservative 

524.07 525.69 B: some are yeah 

525.43 527.12 A: but yeah i don't know 

527.01 530.30 B: (( no i hear you ah there there's definitely a lot of i i tend to )) 

530.74 533.96 B: there are definitely a lot of things i agree with the libertarian party on 

534.01 536.15 B: um but ah 

536.21 540.05 B: overall i mean first of all i'm if you if i wanna run and win i 

540.18 543.62 B: needed to choose one of the main parties in which i 

542.05 543.23 A: yeah 

543.87 547.84 B: staunchly would go much more republican than democrat but ah 

547.90 549.98 B: you know the other thing is that you know 

550.03 552.56 B: when it comes to economics i'm 

552.69 553.84 B: i'm pretty 

554.29 561.48 B: republican you know and probably 'cause the libertarians agree a lot on on economic policies libertarians take it a little more 

562.10 568.97 B: really even more to the right than republicans do but you know but socially i'm i'm probably 

564.18 565.36 A: yeah 

569.51 572.64 B: i'm actually a little more liberal when it comes to social policy 

572.73 581.77 A: you see i i think almost with regards to that i'm left wing big time so that's why i can't really identify with either par- party 'cause that can 

580.05 590.91 B: yeah myself included i just decided that if it comes i i'm pretty big ah left wing socially for issues that are non economic in nature 

590.39 593.14 A: yeah that's kind of where i fall 

591.57 599.89 B: you know i mean but once we start throwing in dollars and start saying you know we're gonna you know make it this way and throw all this money in well then i'm like whoa let's ta-
