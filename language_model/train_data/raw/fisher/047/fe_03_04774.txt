11.02 14.37 A: you're not i'm no i quit ah sixteen years ago 

14.17 15.54 B: very good 

14.96 18.69 A: and ah haven't had one since and i um 

19.54 28.98 A: sort of obj- i when it first quit i felt i would never object to people smoking but as the time has gone on [laughter] i almost feel i'm more allergic to it 

28.69 29.74 B: right 

29.31 31.81 A: and did you ever smoke or 

31.48 36.58 B: no i never smoked but i have a um twin sister and she smokes 

34.82 37.34 A: mm mhm mhm 

36.40 41.23 B: and um she doesn't smoke in my parent's house she still lives at home i don't 

41.01 53.05 B: but when i go there well actually she smokes in her bedroom and you could smell the smoke coming out and just the smell of smoke i'm allergic to it first of all so i can't stand it but um 

46.82 48.05 A: (( mm yeah )) 

51.54 53.86 A: (( oh yeah [cough] [noise] )) 

52.97 57.39 B: i can't stand the smell of smoke and the way everything smells 

57.28 70.14 B: when people smoke and i'm so happy that they're banning [noise] it in places because when i used to out a lot and ah come home all my clothes would reek of smoke and you can't it out of your hair and 

69.97 70.76 A: mhm 

69.98 74.13 B: your clothing and it was disgusting and it's such a difference because 

74.18 87.16 B: i had gone to the city a couple of weeks ago with my friends and what a difference going into a restaurant and a bar and hanging out and not coming home and smelling [noise] you know like that like a cigarette 

85.04 85.89 A: yeah 

86.94 99.13 A: yeah i well i find that's exactly i was gonna say the same thing and the other thing i find which is almost ludicrous is the idea of having no smoking areas and smoking areas in a particular like a restaurant 

95.53 96.50 B: mhm 

99.24 106.68 A: because the smoke doesn't not come over [laughter] you know like we have some restaurants here that have a little 

103.10 104.81 B: right exactly [noise] 

106.71 112.72 A: ah just above the booth they'll have a piece of glass about maybe twelve to eighteen inches 

108.39 109.22 B: mhm 

112.15 113.41 B: right 

112.83 115.70 A: and on the other side of that people are smoking 

116.05 129.95 B: right well they've yeah they've totally it and i live in nassau county and they've banned it totally smoking in the restaurants and in bars in ah nassau and suffolk county where i live and i even think in manhattan [noise] 

116.08 118.03 A: (( [mn] [cough] mm oh good )) 

120.60 122.22 A: mhm 

124.48 125.73 A: mhm 

129.79 141.54 B: [noise] they've done that as well [noise] like which is you know good and a lot of people were protesting about it but first of all a it's only gonna save their lives and they're not you know giving second hand smoke to 

138.23 139.33 A: mhm 

141.58 143.28 B: you know other people 

141.82 153.66 A: other yeah can you imagine having to work in that like you know for the say a a waitress that doesn't wo- doesn't smoke and has to go in and out of there all the time and um i don't know if it's you know 

144.81 146.37 B: no ugh 

148.19 149.44 B: right and having 

153.72 163.38 A: here they haven't got to that point yet but they've got it down to i think it's sixty percent non smoking in restaurants ah edmonton which is west of here in canada 

158.63 159.61 B: right 

163.43 164.41 B: mhm 

163.55 166.30 A: ah they've banned it from all restaurants 

166.37 168.18 A: there's no smoking at all 

168.39 175.87 A: and um [cough] but i don't what how they can stop people from smoking like they were talking in one of the questions about cessation programs 

174.11 179.93 B: right i mean they raised the price enough that you would think that people wouldn't you know be smoking 

178.88 181.83 A: mm mhm yeah and um 

180.55 185.38 B: i mean it's ridiculous how much you have to pay for a pack of cigarettes or a carton of cigarettes 

183.76 184.88 A: oh i ca- 

185.02 189.79 A: yeah our daughter and and son in law they just quit about a month ago 

189.62 190.56 B: (( mhm )) 

189.95 195.08 A: and ah like they were it was ridiculous you know a hundred and fifty dollars a week for cigarettes 

195.03 196.04 B: right 

195.68 198.41 A: and then they have no money [laughter] 

197.35 200.22 B: right exactly well stop smoking [laughter] 

199.48 207.51 A: [laughter] yeah but i don't know ah how the cessation programs i mean should everybody else be paying for those people to to quit or 

200.66 201.80 B: you know what 

207.70 218.67 B: i know i mean there are people you know that have other addictions that you're not paying for and you know i mean this affects everyone because it's known that second hand smoke 

207.71 208.62 A: (( ah )) 

211.60 212.40 A: mhm 

213.22 214.52 A: mhm 

218.66 225.35 B: you know can you know cause cancer to people as well as you know smoking originally and it's 

224.10 225.26 A: (( yeah the )) 

225.61 226.89 B: consideration 

226.70 233.97 A: yeah the the country you said that you live in [noise] it's no smoking it that like any public building or 

229.90 230.75 B: mhm 

233.52 235.43 B: no public building nowhere 

235.07 241.09 A: absolutely nowhere [cough] like stadium stadiums what about stadiums and that kind of thing you 

236.16 239.70 B: no you can smoke outside of the building like 

240.14 241.11 B: um 

241.12 244.43 B: i don't know 'cause the stadiums are outdoors so i'm 

241.14 242.04 A: (( know )) 

243.55 247.96 A: yeah they're sort of outdoors yeah [noise] 'cause that could be bothersome yeah 

245.15 252.98 B: but i'm not really yeah i mean i have no hesitation whatsoever to tell ask someone to put it out 

252.55 254.48 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

253.32 261.91 B: because it's offensive i mean we were um we were in florida and we went to ah a steakhouse morten's i don't know if you have them near you 

261.64 262.91 A: (( no not a morten's )) 

261.81 272.97 B: but it it's it's an expensive steakhouse and we were sitting next to a man 'cause like you said the cig- the smoking section was one booth over and he was smoking a cigar 

264.06 265.34 A: mhm 

270.34 271.52 A: mhm 

272.78 274.46 A: ouch i hate those 

273.10 278.03 B: in this restaurant yeah i mean it was so offensive we asked to move our table 

277.04 279.65 A: yeah oh yeah mhm 

277.98 291.78 B: you know and they had to rearrange the whole thing and nobody wanted to sit next to him but and so it was like you know up scale steak restaurant you know men like to smoke their cigars there you know no offence or anything but 

288.17 289.64 A: [cough] mhm ah 

290.27 294.89 A: yeah that's a pile a that's that's nonsense though really you know 

293.17 304.52 B: right exactly and i'm like i'm not gonna you know enjoy my dinner and spend a hundred dollars a person to sm- you know to have ah a nice dinner when someone is smoking a cigar in my face 'cause i will not enjoy it 

301.76 303.65 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

304.11 313.12 A: no no right and that's what we ah we like to we go on cruises and ah most of them are no smoking you know except the odd little place 

313.09 322.98 A: and you just stay out of those and it's kind of nice you know that they've changed all of those 'cause the less they can have the smoking around the better as far as i'm concerned 

316.09 317.06 B: yeah 

322.37 332.77 B: yeah exactly and you know i mean i feel bad for the for the people that ah you know that smoke and are being left out but i mean do they get the hint [laughter]

352.28 361.73 A: holding it yeah [laughter] you know and they say the the next disease of smokers is gonna be um pneumonia [laughter] 

359.18 362.17 B: right exactly 'cause they have to be outside 

361.81 363.84 A: (( yeah and ah but ah )) 

363.03 374.25 B: but i don't think that i mean we've already paid for it for the amount of time that we've been alive having to deal with people smoking so i don't think that we should have to pay for you know anything else and people 

366.17 367.87 A: mhm 

369.10 370.39 A: mhm 

373.23 374.58 A: (( yeah yep ))

399.88 401.88 A: (( oh yeah )) 

403.03 411.98 A: yeah yeah i don't know it it just seems to be i know when i was young ah which i'm not now but ah [laughter] it was fashionable to smoke then 

408.85 409.86 B: [laughter] 

411.96 412.90 B: right
