4.56 12.95 B: hi [lipsmack] [sigh] um all right well hobbies um is this something am i supposed to go first or do you go first or does it really matter or 

12.19 17.03 A: [noise] ah [lipsmack] it doesn't matter [sigh] i was just actually writing down some of the stuff they wanted us to talk about [sigh] 

16.56 25.51 B: okay [noise] okay [sigh] i think they said what are your hobbies how much time do you spend and then do you think everyone should have at least one hobby is that right okay 

17.44 18.38 A: um 

19.01 19.60 A: (( [noise] )) 

24.00 27.33 A: [sigh] [sigh] yes absolutely [sigh] absolutely 

26.02 29.62 B: okay [sigh] well if you like i can go ahead i can go first 

28.07 29.85 A: (( [noise] [sigh] sure )) 

29.65 31.38 B: [lipsmack] well i [sigh] 

31.27 45.95 B: i actually have a lot of different hobbies and the reason i do is because i believe it's important to have a well balanced life and [sigh] i've seen too many people have you know just too much concentration on work let's say and they don't b- balance their lives so [sigh] um my hobbies are um 

45.82 47.24 B: [cough] excuse me singing 

47.36 52.44 B: [lipsmack] um playing flute playing piano [sigh] um hiking 

52.42 65.25 B: [sigh] um teaching aerobics and then excising lifting weights [sigh] um and travelling i would say those are probably my main hobbies and then i i also enjoy reading and writing [lipsmack] as well what about you [lipsmack] uh-hum uh-hum 

63.03 64.75 A: excellent 

64.95 76.03 A: [lipsmack] um [sigh] yeah i i actually believe in pretty much what you said it's important to have hobbies to take you mind off of worries from work [sigh] and also give you a little change [sigh] in rhythm 

75.89 90.29 A: um [lipsmack] i enjoy mostly anything outdoors i i i love to do ah camping and hiking [sigh] i ah i try to maintain a small garden and little ah kitchen garden that i tend to grow vegetables in every year 

89.92 91.13 B: (( okay mm [noise] [mn] )) 

90.62 100.62 A: [lipsmack] and ah you know keeping on with outdoors tradition i usually ah like to play a lot of sports [sigh] mainly tennis and [sigh] s- soccer um 

99.11 100.28 B: (( okay [mn] okay )) 

100.95 112.57 A: ah but all of these tend to kind of die down during the winter time so in winter time i kind of pick up on my [sigh] you know hobbies to read and [sigh] just catch up on some of the stuff [noise] [sigh] [lipsmack] 

104.93 106.54 B: (( sure uh-hum )) 

111.42 121.54 B: okay [sigh] i guess in terms of like time that's spent on the hobbies i mean i was thinking about that and [sigh] yeah that's something that i i i wish that i could spend more time on things like my 

121.47 134.63 B: my music i mean i sing in a choir [noise] so that's a regular hobby that i have every week but [sigh] when it comes to playing th- the piano and playing the flute these are hobbies that [sigh] unfortunately i don't have a lot of time for and with the piano you know if you don't have access to a p- 

134.49 141.68 B: to a piano you can't [laughter] p- play the piano [sigh] um so that that's been something that i wish i could spend more time on you know but um 

136.54 138.21 A: (( right [noise] )) 

141.87 142.53 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

142.42 150.44 B: in in terms of my reading and writing that's something i try to do every day i try to [sigh] you know find a new book a at least weekly that i can read you know 

150.38 161.45 B: different subject areas that that interest me [sigh] and [sigh] that's something that i try to do and [sigh] i mean i guess like you you know things the outdoor activities like hiking that i enjoy definitely die down in the winter 

160.81 162.56 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [lipsmack] that's right [laughter] 

161.96 166.79 B: but with summer coming up i'm excited because i you know that'll be a chance to do that more [sigh] [cough] 

166.21 178.52 A: yeah and and outdoor kind of activities you know they they seem to be concentrated like you you want to take some time off you want to take some vacation and then go some place for five six days and [sigh] you'll be doing a lot of outdoors at that time [sigh] 

167.59 168.38 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

174.89 176.05 B: that's right 

178.11 178.93 B: (( yes [noise] )) 

178.34 186.04 A: ah but um and my gardening also picks up some time in march april may timeframe and kind of dies down in august [sigh] [noise] um 

186.10 195.44 A: [lipsmack] however i play tennis kind of regularly throughout the year [lipsmack] [noise] and you know i usually don't play [noise] more than an hour [sigh] and maybe every other day so um 

189.10 190.12 B: okay 

192.49 193.43 B: okay 

194.86 195.79 B: okay 

195.47 201.59 A: [noise] so on an on an average on a given week i probably spend about five or six hours on on these things together 

200.59 201.48 B: okay 

201.61 209.49 A: which kind of helps me and i gives me a good balance and also some time away from [sigh] home family and work [laughter] 

201.62 202.48 B: okay 

203.10 204.22 B: (( uh-hum )) 

207.66 213.30 B: sure sure which sometimes yes can get very overwhelming and you have to have that that balance 

212.89 214.23 A: yeah and i you know 

214.29 223.58 A: going to the next next question i i re- s- surely believe that ah every person should have something else they want they like to do [sigh] other than work 

221.93 222.76 B: (( [sigh] uh-hum )) 

223.30 224.48 B: (( right mm )) 

223.62 226.47 A: [sigh] it it helps people relax um 

226.53 229.76 A: it helps people make new friends [sigh] 

229.92 235.10 A: and ah some time later on in the life and you and when you've done with your work life you know [lipsmack] 

235.23 237.03 A: a lot of people tend to pick 

237.31 249.64 A: ah hobbies as their next major thing and either settle down around what they like to do or even [sigh] you know continue on their employment in their area of ah [lipsmack] hobbies that they like [sigh] so [noise] 

247.33 247.95 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

247.77 257.15 B: yeah but you know sometimes i wonder if [sigh] i wonder if there's a gender difference sometimes in hobbies and the reason that i [sigh] i ask this is because i i know that for a lot of men [sigh] 

257.02 271.39 B: work defines who they are it defines a big portion of who they are and that's just something that society has sort of set out for them [sigh] so i wonder if it's it's if that makes it harder or easier for men to develop hobbies or if they feel that [sigh] you know anything that takes away from work 

271.20 276.71 B: perhaps you you know even if it's a hobby they enjoy that that it's not a worthwhile thing i mean i don't know what do you think 

274.95 275.69 A: (( [sigh] [noise] )) 

275.97 290.95 A: [lipsmack] me i i i tend to think it's it it really doesn't matter that much [sigh] as as far as what gender you are [sigh] most men you you'll see um love sports in one way or another and if they don't play it they'll watch it and [noise] 

281.21 281.93 B: okay 

286.94 288.02 B: (( uh-hum )) 

289.70 290.59 B: true 

290.92 303.28 A: and ah even at work if if two people meet at work they will talk less about work and more about w- who won last sunday night's football game or or stuff like that [sigh] so ah 

300.41 302.39 B: yes that's true 

302.94 303.97 B: (( that's true )) 

303.34 316.81 A: men do tend to actually they seem to bond together m- more on non work issues like you know going to the gym together or [sigh] or playing a game of tennis together or talking about their favorite sports star together so [mn] [sigh] [noise] 

310.79 311.84 B: right 

315.81 324.91 B: sure that makes sense [sigh] i wonder too i mean just going back to the issue of if everyone should develop a hobby if that's [sigh] if it's easier when you're a child to kind of fall into the pattern of 

324.87 339.73 B: [sigh] you know picking up a hobby and if it's something that's encouraged versus if you're an adult you may start to feel that it's forced you know well i need to do this because it's good for me or [sigh] you know so i wonder how hard it is for adults who [sigh] have never really had hobbies at all to just suddenly try to pick it up 

330.45 332.39 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

339.71 346.42 B: [sigh] you know pick something up and like like for you when did you start with with your hobbies like the gardening and the tennis and 

345.71 356.20 A: [sigh] [mn] [lipsmack] um gardening was pretty much ah right from the beginning because my parents used to do it so i kind of worked alongside them [sigh] um as far as tennis it kind of started in college [sigh] 

352.09 353.03 B: okay 

355.54 356.51 B: (( uh-hum okay )) 

356.22 365.36 A: whenever there was free time i would go and play [sigh] but um i you know i kind of agree that a h- hobby is something that a child should be introduced in it's childhood [sigh] 

364.95 365.99 B: yes 

365.48 368.58 A: um [lipsmack] mainly because at that time they can 

368.56 380.33 A: pretty much make up their mind what they want to befriend and what they want to stay busy with [sigh] and then you know if you get involved at that age then over time you'll become b- better and better at whatever you 

380.12 387.27 A: you pick as your hobby [lipsmack] for for example in your case i would think that you probably picked up music at quite an early age 

381.37 382.29 B: right 

386.31 388.99 B: right absolutely absolutely yes 

387.99 394.22 A: [sigh] and it has stayed with you till this day and most likely it'll stay with you you know forever [sigh] [lipsmack] 

392.15 405.03 B: [noise] yes [sigh] and i think part of that you know is is there is a genetic component to that too i mean i i know that you know i got this from my father's side of the family and [sigh] but it's also that he actively encouraged me from an early age and you know if 

405.26 416.51 B: i know i know of some kids who [sigh] you know they they either w- wanted to be musicians or they had that interest but some adults squelched it early on [sigh] or they want to do it but they just they they don't have the 

416.28 428.07 B: encouragement i suppose from their parents or it was never really emphasized very much in their family [sigh] um so i think that genetic or that i don't know what you want to call it that early component is so important [sigh] you know um yes 

421.43 423.22 A: yeah 

427.29 437.02 A: [noise] absolutely [sigh] and and a child will always pick what their parent do if the parent you know [sigh] it's amazing how much ah how often a a child follows in the footstep of their parents [sigh] 

436.79 446.03 A: even in even in you know in in what career they take most likely they they are [sigh] ah inclined to go in what their parents are in [sigh] 

440.81 441.67 B: (( right [noise] )) 

445.43 446.96 B: (( right that's it [noise] [noise] )) 

445.81 454.21 A: yeah and if you know if if the father if the dad or the mom is ah picking up a book and reading a newspaper every day [sigh] making a 

453.99 461.12 A: habit of that the kid will also try to pick up something and read along oh hang on to the comics or whatever [sigh] 

457.80 459.07 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

459.81 471.72 B: that's right [sigh] i wonder too how easy it is to transform a hobby into a full fledged career i mean i just [sigh] you know for instance i think of tennis you know and and you think of [sigh] of of the the tennis stars i mean i'm sure that they began 

471.65 486.16 B: early on taking lessons at an early age they had a lot of [sigh] professional training but [sigh] i wonder if that was ever really sort of a hobby to them or if right away it was emphasized as [sigh] this is what you need to do so it wasn't so much fun [sigh] but it became work you know where is that line uh-hum 

483.00 485.09 A: yeah that's a go- 

485.43 499.33 A: that's a good question i no i didn't think that they probably started it as hey let's try it out and see how how well we can hit the ball and then eventually they figured out [sigh] or a coach told them that they got good potential so they might want to spend more and more time on it [sigh] but you know [lipsmack] 

496.14 496.99 B: (( right right )) 

497.51 498.39 B: (( right [noise] uh-hum )) 

499.20 500.81 A: what i was thinking is even 

500.92 501.67 A: (( you know )) 

501.86 513.59 A: let's say somebody plays a game of softball or baseball throughout their life [sigh] and over time they can probably find some em- employment in that field you know like refereeing a game or 

510.94 511.90 B: sure 

513.38 520.88 A: p- playing or working for a league or something like that [sigh] so lots of times you know they you really do not need to be 

516.32 517.13 B: right 

520.67 534.76 A: the official baseball major league player to actually [laughter] make some money out of your hobby they're a lot of other um jobs associated with that like in your case you know for example there's a there's a musician there are hundreds of jobs that a musician would create [sigh] 

523.12 524.07 B: sure 

525.64 527.10 B: (( sure sure )) 

529.76 530.52 B: (( uh-hum )) 

534.30 535.96 B: right that's true 

534.96 536.88 A: alongside so um 

536.98 538.93 B: but then at one point does that become 

537.41 537.99 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

538.70 543.40 B: not a hobby anymore but work you know so what is the formal definition of a hobby [sigh] 

540.68 542.64 A: yeah 

543.32 557.43 B: and and at what point then does it lose that [sigh] you know because when i think of the word hobby i think of something that you do in your leisure time and [sigh] something that's fun [sigh] you know and that you set the parameters and you set the time but [sigh] when it morphs into work somehow it loses that 

554.18 555.94 A: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

557.29 558.79 B: or it could lose that 

557.35 560.40 A: right right 

558.89 560.90 B: because now you have to earn your living [noise] you 

560.69 570.05 A: right you know sometimes people say you should you should work what you really [sigh] like you should work what you really like to do like to work so [lipsmack] 

567.60 569.12 B: (( know so that's true )) 

570.02 578.63 A: you know maybe it's not a bad idea to eventually at some point pursue your hobby more seriously and [sigh] still do it for the sake of fun but hey 

574.58 575.42 B: (( right )) 

578.68 584.53 A: if if they want to generate some some money then you know so be it [laughter] 

582.90 585.69 B: yeah exactly exactly i do 

584.77 587.09 A: i also go ahead sorry 

586.29 595.70 B: oh i was just going to say now this is just kind of talking more about what the definition of a hobby is i mean have you ever seen a formal definition [sigh] of of what exactly a hobby means or what it is 

595.75 599.89 A: [noise] um i i ah i have not looked but you know i'm sure if 

596.14 596.74 B: (( [sigh] ))
