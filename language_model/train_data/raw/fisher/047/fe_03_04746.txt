230.76 232.55 A: mhm 

231.58 235.32 B: [sigh] um and that's basically it i mean

243.37 244.30 A: (( my )) 

243.55 246.26 B: i don't consider it as a hobby i consider it as 

246.43 248.00 B: my life 

248.00 249.08 A: (( yeah )) 

248.29 251.63 B: my lifestyle i don't consider it as a hobby but um 

251.76 260.75 B: some people would consider it as a hobby they would put that down as a hobby i do i'm i'm a troop leader for the girl scouts um that's that's considered a 

257.66 258.56 A: mhm 

260.85 263.65 B: a hobby because i do that once a week um and 

264.07 269.32 B: then deal with brownies i have girls ages six to nine 

265.43 267.35 A: mhm 

269.72 271.45 B: and i have eleven girls [lipsmack] 

272.11 275.44 B: so that's something that i i'm involved in and um i 

276.75 277.76 A: (( [cough] )) 

277.73 279.41 B: think that's it [laughter] 

278.93 284.99 A: yeah i try to i try to get kids in tune to writing so maybe they can have a hobby 

284.69 285.65 B: yeah 

284.90 295.40 A: because one i teach in inner city so it's like you want kids to have some type of positive outlook for their emotions and their feelings or whatever 

289.06 290.16 B: yeah 

294.81 296.39 B: definitely 

296.55 300.34 A: and it's really me that 

300.09 307.81 B: it is it is that's that's that's a great asset because i know that when i was a child that was something that my father 

308.02 309.82 B: was really into and 

310.09 315.58 B: that was before you even thought about watching t._v. was to read a book to get knowledge in you 

313.66 315.57 A: right 

315.62 318.79 B: your head and watching t._v. just didn't seem 

318.83 324.16 B: beneficial for you to get knowledge it was more so about reading and understanding what you were reading 

324.23 325.85 A: right that's 

324.87 326.14 B: (( and uh [mn] mhm )) 

326.05 329.79 A: that's how i kind of got into my hobby because actually 

329.60 335.22 A: it wasn't about that like we would watch sports me and my dad we'd watch it together but it's like 

335.03 344.63 A: it wasn't inv- inva- it wasn't like non valuable because i got to learn the game i got to learn something even though i was just watching t._v. you got to learn something 

340.38 341.22 B: yeah 

344.66 347.36 A: it's different that way [cough] 

346.12 351.72 B: yeah believe it or not i'm i i watched a lot of t._v. when i was a kid and i used to 

351.83 353.93 B: (( fight with my dad all the time because i would )) 

353.98 361.79 B: i read but i i really liked t._v. now now that i'm an adult [mn] i if i watch t._v. maybe 

362.67 365.72 B: three times a week that would be a miracle 

365.21 366.34 A: (( mhm [mn] )) 

366.10 368.95 B: 'cause i can be home all day and won't even turn the t._v. on 

369.24 377.94 B: and that's just me i mean uh maybe because as a child i watched so much t._v. or tried to now that i'm an adult and i have my own t._v.s i don't even watch it 

378.19 385.22 B: so um i mean my my husband they watch sports and stuff like that basketball 

384.92 385.82 A: (( mm )) 

385.27 392.69 B: stuff like that but far as just sitting here and just watching t._v. no i can be in the living room and the t._v. can be on if they're watching t._v. but 

392.47 406.67 B: i can be on the computer or i'm reading a book so i'm really not even paying it any mind now if it's the news it's different i will watch that for a minute until you know until i just get tired of that and then i'll just say forget it 

406.61 408.99 B: um i'll go back to reading [laughter] 

408.96 423.65 A: right really man i just try to stay active as far as my hobbies uh as far as politically and things like that because things need to change and since being in d. c. is like one of the places where you can change a lot of things with this 

417.00 417.95 B: yeah 

422.90 425.25 B: (( yeah exactly mhm mhm )) 

423.73 434.39 A: but not everybody's uh reputable so that's why i'm very selective and somewhat of a loner about things like that [cough] 

433.76 438.12 B: mhm exactly 'cause you're you're in d. c. so yeah you're observed to a lot of 

438.34 439.81 B: more things than 

439.87 451.35 B: i am but on a c- on a certain scale i'm still i'm still surrounded by you know the politics aspects of things and stuff like that but not as much 

451.70 458.22 B: um but um yeah i mean hobbies are definitely a good thing to have um 

458.56 460.21 B: they definitely 

461.35 464.39 B: have a a a different uh 

464.61 469.02 B: approach on life as itself because you can do it by yourself and be happy 

469.28 482.71 B: and be content [laughter] and don't have to worry about sharing it with nobody else your hobby but [mn] and plus it's something that you really like to do i think that's why you should always pick jobs and something that you really like to do 

470.72 471.79 A: right 

474.09 475.27 A: mhm 

482.53 483.58 A: right 

482.81 485.27 B: around your hobby because then it helps 

485.34 488.93 B: to deal with the things that you have to deal with during the day 

488.68 496.36 A: right like being a teacher i have a lot of access to um well not as much as i used to but i have a good amount of access to computers 

495.83 497.02 B: yeah 

496.42 500.48 A: and you know basically just sharing ideas with other people 

499.87 501.24 B: yeah 

501.05 503.20 A: because really i mean 

503.25 509.77 A: i don't know if hobby has a definition but really my main definition of hobby is basically uh 

509.87 517.01 A: some- [mn] basically something you like doing it doesn't is nece- it doesn't necessarily have to be something very specific 

512.56 513.54 B: yeah 

517.51 518.41 A: (( [cough] )) 

518.00 526.23 B: mhm yeah you're right because we have [mn] there's a lot of things that we may like to do it doesn't necessarily mean it has to be a hobby 

526.35 534.05 B: but it could be just something that we do on a daily basis uh you know you would consider as a hobby we would probably consider it as a routine 

533.79 535.76 A: mhm 

534.33 536.97 B: if anything uh so 

538.85 540.87 B: (( but that's all i can think of mhm mhm )) 

541.18 553.55 A: yeah i mean jersey we have different hobbies compared to basically the rest of the country because basically we uh were the founders of hip hop so 

553.43 562.83 A: that's influenced my a lot of my hobbies as far as uh with music i listen to the type of style that i have uh the type of 

563.10 567.03 A: books that i read that's what molded it really like 

566.29 567.65 B: yeah 

567.22 577.80 A: i mean growing up in the days of you know public enemy and mellie mell and carriers one i mean all these guys they only li- i mean basic- 

570.93 572.05 B: oh yeah mhm 

577.77 583.78 A: [cough] basically new york was only an hour and a half away from where i lived so so new york city so 

581.37 582.80 B: oh yeah 

583.01 584.01 B: uh-huh 

584.09 586.84 A: and philly caught a lot of the um 

588.26 593.91 A: the offshoots of hip hop so we got into it just just as much if not more than uh new york 

593.59 594.56 B: yeah 

594.05 599.95 A: so that's why i see a difference in down here there's a whole lot of other people's view on hi-
