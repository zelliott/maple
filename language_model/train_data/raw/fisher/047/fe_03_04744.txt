111.35 115.50 B: yeah but i haven't gotten much chance to play in a while because of work and stuff 

115.29 127.65 B: like i used to play like a lot when i was bored but now since with like new girlfriend and like this school and then like resumes and stuff for internships that i have to do because i finishing you know my sophomore year this year 

121.68 122.73 A: yep

137.97 138.72 A: (( um )) 

139.38 142.76 B: i guess would lifting lifting wouldn't count as hobby right 

142.36 150.49 A: i i it's sort of sort of weird like whether whether that would be a hobby or not uh uh because it's it's it's more of like a like a self uh self improvement uh 

150.78 158.97 A: activity you know like i wouldn't call like for instance uh like cleaning your house i wouldn't call that a hobby and it's to me they're they're very similar 

154.91 155.77 B: uh-huh 

159.07 167.66 B: oh yeah i think like um how 'bout like wh- what do you think about like building a house or like refurnishing houses would that be like a hobby 

167.31 181.72 A: i suppose like sort of the thing is whether you do it for fun or or try and make money out i don't you know i don't i don't know what the actual definition of it but but i would say if if you really enjoy that yeah i would i would say you know build- building a house are are you are you like a a a a house 

174.54 175.91 B: [laughter] 

181.55 182.56 A: rebuilder 

181.81 187.45 B: (( no no i was just i was just giving an example 'cause uh you said like cleaning a house or something i was just you know just )) 

187.44 194.81 A: okay yeah i mean um but i think i think of you know i think of cleaning your house you you know that's sort of taking care of your house sort of like working out is taking care of your body 

194.58 195.45 B: uh-huh 

195.22 206.63 B: it's not um yeah i guess like things like playing cards i like to play cards also and i guess that's also could be a hobby but like um maybe they're focusing on like collecting things or like things like that 

195.28 196.19 A: the same 

206.42 215.21 B: um i kind of you know i ki- i keep sentimental things like a lot of things like like yeah like movie stubs 

211.90 215.17 A: okay like what like like old old letters 

215.53 229.96 B: yeah movie stubs um just like yeah even like even like wrappers of uh like wrappers of candy if like someone bought and gave it to me or like i just got back from hong kong like i hadn't seen my cousins in ten years and they gave me like 

217.34 218.61 A: (( oh re- oh okay )) 

228.46 229.43 A: mhm 

229.89 234.88 B: like a ring or something i guess i like collecting things like that like sentimental things like 

234.08 241.68 A: that's that's going to be real cool for you later 'cause you're going to have all of these all of these actual physical things to look back and remember these times with 

240.56 252.76 B: yeah and also like i just got a a digital camcorder too so now i like i also like to like to videotape when i'm hanging round with my friends or family and things like that so that's going to be exciting to look at i guess 

248.28 249.30 A: oh cool 

253.52 261.71 B: i guess it's not going to grow old and it's not going to grow out so and i'm not going to be a professional in it so i just i think that considers constitutes as a hobby 

262.08 264.08 A: okay yeah yeah definitely 

262.57 263.51 B: (( you know )) 

264.02 269.57 B: yeah but uh i think uh this asked uh what is it important for people to have hobbies [mn] 

269.75 275.02 B: obviously i think it is important for people to have hobbies [mn] mhm 

270.00 270.90 A: yeah i 

273.89 275.39 A: i think i think 

275.45 288.27 A: uh i think it's it's very very important i i think one of the things i i really used to love about mountain biking was no matter what the hell my problems were uh [mn] if i was doing if if it was serious mountain biking 

288.24 298.06 A: you had to concentrate on the tree stumps and the rocks in front of you you know and i couldn't think about any other problems in my life other than getting down this hill without breaking my fricking neck 

291.52 292.52 B: yeah 

297.81 300.37 B: (( oh yeah yeah um )) 

300.25 313.24 B: like when i used to do it i i i uh ran track all fours of high school and like i i was really into running and stuff and i actually ran sometimes to get away from things and also to like so i can think by myself you know 

304.63 305.59 A: mhm 

313.24 314.55 A: yeah exactly 

313.50 322.21 B: so like it's like it's like you're alone and like you running you know you run faster as you're getting mad or like something it's just you know like are you going to keep pace 

320.52 328.92 A: i i i love that that's that's i i think that that's real important another thing i don't i don't do it very often but i used to uh um 

322.65 323.48 B: yeah 

325.58 326.61 B: yeah 

329.04 337.27 A: uh uh paint uh like you know make paintings and and the thing is i was i am no damn good at it i am just awful 

331.04 331.87 B: uh-huh 

332.83 333.66 B: uh-huh 

336.25 338.26 B: [laughter] 

337.39 342.45 A: and and it was great though because like you know when i when i i'm a songwriter so when i write songs 

342.39 356.53 A: they're they're supposed to be good that's my job to make 'em good but when i'm writing a but when i'm when i'm painting i know it's terrible and it's just really fun to splash the paint around on the canvas and you know even even though i know it's going to be terrible so i 

344.80 345.64 B: uh-huh 

345.86 346.69 B: uh-huh 

354.16 355.28 B: yeah 

355.47 366.02 B: yeah i guess like a hobby's just something you do like for fun like it has to be fun yeah and that's why it's important it's important with like gateways to get away from like life sometimes and uh do something and have fun 

358.17 359.10 A: for fun 

359.18 360.53 A: [mn] yeah it's a rela- 

363.94 365.32 A: yeah 

366.04 374.49 A: i guess my my music started off as a hobby and then and then it ended up being my career and so it's definitely definitely less fun than it used to be
