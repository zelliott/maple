125.54 126.73 A: right 

128.51 140.44 B: cigarette smoking or from joe camel to the lady on the virginia slim pack you know they say you come a long way baby you know smoking virginia slims and so with advertising and all that

166.39 173.40 B: yeah yeah the health reason's definitely number one that's definitely number one taboo and then the price and the inconvenience like you say 

173.31 178.23 A: yeah the price i think is just how much is it now for a pack of cigarettes 

176.72 184.52 B: well every everywhere varies like if you i guess if you get down south they give you get 'em for like three dollars a pack and if you get 'em up here up north they're like 

184.78 188.74 B: anywhere from five to eight dollars a pack so you know you're talking five bucks 

188.10 195.38 A: i think it's around five here yeah something like that but i don't know i just think it's it's up to people 

189.93 190.85 B: yeah 

195.25 204.67 A: themselves also i mean as far as like a bar goes if somebody doesn't wanna smell and and all that then they shouldn't go to a bar that's all

340.23 349.57 A: but um you know like i said it just got to be such a hassle with the i mean it's good that i stopped from a health standpoint but 

344.26 345.65 B: mhm 

348.21 350.60 B: right that's good very good

370.31 372.75 A: about how much do you smoke a week 

372.02 383.12 B: i like ah let me see a week well let me see all depends on how i'm feeling what i'm going through but probably no more than two packs a week but like i said it all depends on what i'm doing how i'm feeling okay like if 

378.83 380.33 A: uh-huh well that's not 

383.21 388.04 B: it's a day that i'm working i may only smoke ten but if i go to the club i might smoke twenty

395.69 400.47 B: so it depends on what i'm doing if i'm at a club if i'm on if i'm at work you know it all depends 

399.84 410.02 A: i didn't have too much trouble stopping but the where i had the biggest problem was when i went into a bar that's that's where i really 

402.69 403.78 B: mhm 

408.04 415.86 B: yeah well it be so smokey in there anyway i can remember even being a kid and and going in there with my parents or for my parents

422.45 424.01 B: (( this stuff is strong )) 

422.49 429.34 A: you'd hardly ever there used to be you'd hardly ever hear anybody even complain about it even if they didn't smoke 

428.71 432.48 B: right 'cause it's a relaxer it's been around been around since bootleg alcohol 

432.12 433.96 A: yeah they they people 

433.08 434.92 B: since moonshine been around mhm 

434.11 443.67 A: people didn't care 'til like you know the past five or ten years it seems ever since it was brought more to the attention of everybody 

443.99 452.80 A: you know before then i mean i never heard people say you know talk about the smoke and if if they didn't like it they just didn't go into a place 

449.06 450.28 B: right never 

452.36 463.25 B: well i know a lot of people was getting sick 'cause like my mom she smoked for like i don't know like i don't know what but she forty years or something like that 'cause she's like sixty five so she smoked a good forty five years 

459.26 460.17 A: uh-huh 

463.28 464.19 A: uh-huh 

463.67 473.13 B: and um and and it started affecting her breathing and stuff and she had to get a respiratory ah on respirator and um so she she quit now like um 

470.00 471.37 A: yeah 

473.29 483.30 B: wow that'd be eight years or something now but it it got to the point where she had got so sick so it's it's really not something that people talk about like you say when ha- when and what 

483.59 491.25 B: made it become like a big issue and and you know a lot of people been suffering from you know tobacco related illnesses or death related 

491.16 492.34 A: yeah 

491.75 500.12 B: and um so now like you said i know where the advertising coming from and all you know capitalism behind it all the big you know rah rah about it because um 

500.21 511.74 B: i guess now and the people i don't know people must have been like you know behind the scenes you know getting sick and having bringing about law suits or something like that something had to something had to light a fire under the 

511.28 512.82 A: (( yeah )) 

511.77 514.49 B: tobacco manufacturer's behind for them to 

514.73 528.85 B: you know for this thing to come to a head and then for them to go to you know litigation and this and that and they had this big law suit and [mn] you know all this and then they sued and then they said they were gonna pay people medical bill then they raised the price of cigarettes it was like a merry-go-round it's ike you know stop let me off 

520.63 522.12 A: yeah 

528.45 533.37 A: yeah so- something you're you're definitely right something happened at some point 

529.62 530.19 B: (( [mn] )) 

532.22 539.81 B: yeah something i mean some kind of s- study or some scientific or laboratory wise something really bad for the 'cause that that was a big issue mhm 

539.64 543.28 A: i mean i i think the other thing that stuns me is the fact that 

543.33 545.72 A: that that it there's such a 

545.85 548.94 A: such a um whole ah 

549.09 553.13 A: you know thing against smoking and being around smoking 

552.52 553.48 B: yeah 

553.16 561.07 A: but it you know [laughter] it's it's considered more dangerous than being around guns which i can't quite figure out 

558.99 559.86 B: right 

560.39 564.51 B: drunk driving and all that stuff yeah it's like at the top of the charts now 

563.83 573.94 A: right right it's you know it's considered you know worse than that i mean it's not a big deal to go out and buy a gun but it it's a big deal to smoke a cigarette in a bar 

570.51 571.74 B: right right 

571.88 580.08 B: right yeah or rob a bank or something or or or be a priest and molest children or be accused of you know yeah like that i don't know 

579.26 583.95 A: yeah yeah i mean i i can't see how that could be worse than 

583.88 590.19 A: than guns because that's that's something that's completely out of hand but you know of course 

584.90 585.73 B: right 

588.08 589.19 B: (( mm )) 

590.04 599.05 A: you know i know that s- you know so to speak the people that lobby for guns and that it's a it's a real powerful organization 

594.69 596.25 B: yeah mhm 

598.11 599.06 B: yeah 

599.10 599.95 B: yeah and ah
