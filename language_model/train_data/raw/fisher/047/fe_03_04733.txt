24.65 26.00 B: (( [noise] [noise] oh )) 

26.10 28.77 B: okay i like to restore old cars 

28.59 29.64 A: (( [laughter] not )) 

29.68 43.36 B: [noise] i like to do a few other things too i c- i actually i collect i collect some out of date records and out of date music but uh my my first passion is restoring old cars but that too they cost a fortune 

40.82 41.74 A: (( free it's not )) 

43.30 46.98 A: ((  )) 

45.32 57.15 B: [noise] i see it's strictly a hobby but there's been times where if i wanted to do another project [mn] i had to sell the project i just finished [mn] uh-huh wow [mn] well i understand that 'cause sewing is the same thing 

51.96 53.34 A: (( [mn] 'cause i when i worked as )) 

57.29 57.97 B: (( when )) 

58.26 61.72 B: (( i had to do it )) 

60.39 61.22 A: (( a mechanic )) 

61.90 63.33 B: (( for money )) 

63.12 64.12 A: (( and got real pay )) 

63.52 66.65 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

66.76 68.26 B: (( [noise] )) 

67.09 71.92 A: (( got pay paid i hated it i totally hated it but what i'm able to do with like i do now i like it you know so )) 

71.95 77.85 A: it was more pressure i i i didn't hate it but it wasn't as much fun 

77.65 81.18 B: yes [mn] that [mn] that that's what it is it's not as much fun [mn] 

78.30 79.15 A: but 

79.48 80.41 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

81.36 85.33 B: but you know s- when i mentioned hobbies i'm thinking back to you know when i was a kid 

85.67 93.11 B: [mn] you know i used to collect stamps and coins and race and [mn] and race slot cars and do all that stuff 

93.13 99.10 B: but it's just like i guess it's as we g- we get older we have uh bigger hobbies more expensive tastes in things [mn] 

98.83 105.07 A: right [mn] well to and i don't know it's kind of frustrating too when you don't have enough time 

104.75 109.30 B: [noise] [mn] that's another one of my problems time time is very very short 

109.42 111.20 B: on the free side [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

110.73 115.04 A: [mn] maybe that's why we enjoy our hobbies so much because it's such a treat 

115.31 126.75 A: to do it you know [mn] i mean like you said we didn't you didn't like [mn] doing uh fixing cars when you were [mn] it was a job and i didn't like sewing when i was getting paid for it so 

126.82 130.48 A: you know maybe it's the idea of mentally that it's a treat 

130.54 132.88 A: to be able to do these things so 

133.03 136.67 B: [mn] you see yeah it it's nice if you do it at your speed 

136.06 137.44 A: (( right [noise] )) 

136.71 138.80 B: you do it the way you want to do it 

138.85 141.87 B: and there's nobody standing over you telling you how to do it [noise] 

141.35 142.82 A: yeah yup 

143.20 146.99 A: [noise] yup well i wish i definitely wish i had more time but um 

147.24 150.85 A: 'cause and and now i've started doing quilts 

150.63 152.21 B: (( [noise] oh okay [mn] [noise] )) 

151.58 165.68 A: because um well i have two grown married children and then i have a little girl also and i thought that would be something very nice to leave them you know they would have something but i i i think too everyone should have a hobby 

160.39 162.03 B: sorry yes yes 

165.34 180.09 B: [noise] oh no i i definitely without a doubt i mean you need something to do get besides the norm i mean people go to [mn] you can go out to people go to movies go out to dinner and do all that that's all fine and dandy but like when i my work on the car is like me just you know doing my own thing 

179.67 182.25 A: (( [noise] [noise] [mn] it's a nice escape isn't it [mn] )) 

181.39 186.35 B: yes oh yes it definitely is [mn] gets you out of the reality of the world for a bit [noise] 

185.45 188.43 A: yeah it takes your mind off your troubles for a little while 

187.65 189.02 B: yeah yeah 

188.97 196.76 A: and i i think it's better too that because at least like when you're doing fixing or restoring your cars and so on you're using your brain 

196.56 197.99 B: (( [noise] [noise] [mn] oh yeah )) 

196.93 200.36 A: you know it's not like just sitting in front of the t._v. and 

200.08 203.20 B: no that's why i guess like with the video games 

202.97 204.00 A: mhm 

203.33 206.37 B: you know i mean [mn] i i have five kids 

206.18 208.02 A: (( oh boy so you know ))

212.09 213.02 A: uh-huh 

218.23 219.62 A: (( yes [mn] [noise] [noise] )) 

218.92 225.99 B: bec- unless they're an educational one like my two and a half year old we got him educational ones that shows him how to count 

226.06 231.48 B: and things like that so that's okay [mn] you know but i don't want to see them stuck in that either 

231.24 232.61 A: right 

231.95 234.50 B: because all that is is fantasy world 

234.07 237.05 A: [noise] and all it is is really like a t._v. 

236.95 238.60 B: (( [noise] yeah it is it is ))

261.79 262.71 A: (( [noise] )) 

264.16 265.18 A: uh-huh 

264.66 275.98 B: and you know that's like that's also a hobby you know but i don't get stuck in it as far as watching movie after movie no no no no we don't do that you know what i'm saying 

270.07 271.02 A: (( right [noise] [mn] )) 

275.40 280.81 A: yeah it's just a a form of entertainment when the time is right you sit down and watch a movie 

277.84 278.64 B: right 

280.02 288.26 B: right right but i had a lot of fun with that actually i call that a hobby too 'cause i built the speakers yeah i built the speakers um

295.69 297.16 A: oh 

298.71 304.96 B: so that was nothing i mean my regular trade is i'm a is i'm a carpenter s- class laborer

306.67 307.76 A: oh 

309.38 310.32 A: uh-huh 

315.45 317.38 A: [noise] right [laughter] 

316.09 327.94 B: [mn] but you know i went out i've slowly bought things and i slowly built things to put the things in because i didn't like what they were selling in the stores you know this press wood furniture they call it 

326.85 328.43 A: oh i know 

327.98 337.08 B: and then then anything that's good is two thousand dollars again i built it myself it took a while i didn't have a lot of time and eventually it all came together [mn]

356.53 357.50 A: really 

356.72 363.71 B: you know building a speaker system is not really all that complicated eh you know when you go into the store and you look what they're charging 

360.25 361.08 A: hm 

363.83 366.17 B: you know it's it's a major mark up 

365.73 367.86 A: oh i'll i believe that 

366.52 377.23 B: you know i mean i can build something decent and maybe put two hundred two fifty in it and when you go to the stores twelve eight it's twelve fifteen hundred dollars but it's the same compatible thing [noise]
