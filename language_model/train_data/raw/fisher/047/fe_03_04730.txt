228.22 236.20 A: um [sigh] it's it's a little bit more spacious there's trees you know it's but it's definitely the city 

235.92 236.98 B: okay 

236.40 241.96 A: but we don't have huge buildings on on this side of the river so um definitely [noise] 

242.15 252.45 B: so you so you do have uh open spaces it's it's it's not it's not like building building building building and then an intersection building building 

242.41 251.56 A: (( [noise] yeah ))

257.05 257.88 B: (( wow )) 

258.46 272.68 A: but uh even it it's j- it's just more the you know big old houses and and lots of trees and you know you go downtown and you you spend any time there and you realise that it's i- it's really very different um 

263.58 264.46 B: (( uh-huh )) 

271.79 279.38 B: yeah well i've been i've been in philly i was there uh when i was [mn] stationed in the service we had to come down and see the cracked bell and you know things like that

301.26 302.57 B: yeah it's it's 

303.07 317.80 B: yeah it's it's it's different because you know i'm in the midwest you know and and i can look out my window and and i can't see anything other than farm and farm ground and anything for miles and miles and miles and 

314.21 316.09 A: right 

316.40 318.66 A: (( [noise] )) 

317.66 322.33 B: so i got out there [mn] i was i kinda enjoyed it it was uh it was different

363.66 364.46 B: (( you know ))

398.11 402.85 A: (( [noise] )) 

401.35 404.04 B: you just that's what you do and uh 

404.03 416.18 A: (( [noise] )) 

404.08 408.96 B: but i'm not haven't gotten into that yet i've i've been retired for a while but uh

441.52 445.97 B: um you know it's it's it's that's the fun part of it i guess 

444.19 448.33 A: (( [noise] )) 

446.44 450.67 B: uh there's no money involved in it so i guess you'd maybe call it a hobby
