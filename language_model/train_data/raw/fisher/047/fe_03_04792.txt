162.95 164.52 A: yeah i saw that movie 

165.30 166.86 A: (( yeah )) 

168.97 177.03 A: mm that was like a scared straight that was one less reason why i never really picked it up i i never really picked it up a cigarette and and did it my friends did it 

173.42 174.47 B: exactly 

174.71 175.44 B: no 

175.72 188.65 B: i smoked on on occasion like once in a while but i mean a pack of cigarettes could've gotten lost in my my pocketbook i would never have noticed [laughter] on the yeah like i just tried it just to see like ooh what's this all about you know and it was like ugh i- 

182.63 183.87 A: oh okay 

188.74 191.49 B: it tastes like an ashtray i don't think i need this 

188.92 189.73 A: (( mm )) 

191.14 200.75 A: right i just i was just never you know that that was one of the reasons was that it scared me just scared straight i didn't wanna smoke at all and i d- and i didn't i never done it 

200.31 209.74 B: i asked one of my friends at work 'cause they were talking about cigarettes and someone said like do you know what the price of cigarettes is now a pack of cigarettes i said i have no idea i think they said around five dollars a pack 

209.15 210.33 A: wow 

209.92 214.79 B: and i was like what i says five dollars a pack i says that is ridiculous 

214.20 216.29 A: it's four something here in d._c. 

215.61 217.00 B: and you get people 

217.21 222.89 B: that smoke like a couple of pa- first of all how someone can smoke a couple of pack of cigarettes in one day i'll never know 

222.50 223.91 A: yeah 

223.60 224.57 B: i mean they 

224.59 237.92 B: and so you figure even if you smoke two packs a day add that times four say four that's fourteen packs a week add that money for one week then for a month then for a year you can go on a pretty good vacation by the time this is all over 

237.70 244.76 A: mhm and see my oldest son smokes and he's like [noise] twenty three years old and i mean he's smoke smoke smoke and i i

255.00 255.68 B: (( mm )) 

259.91 271.85 B: i think it's also if how bad you really want it it's just as bad as trying to go on a diet and stick to it it's an addictive habit and i think it's sometimes worse than dieting at least if you're on a diet i could find something else to eat i 

261.35 262.73 A: they don't work 

271.73 273.14 A: mhm 

271.84 280.59 B: can say i shouldn't have that piece of junk food i can go have a piece of fruit or a vegetable instead or you know drink water where if you smoke cigarettes what are you gonna do 

281.70 284.54 B: and i fi- you know it's probably i think it's probably harder 

284.55 286.99 B: to give up smoking than anything else 

287.18 289.77 B: i'm just really happy that you can't smoke even 

289.82 293.41 B: in front of a lot of public buildings or h- um
