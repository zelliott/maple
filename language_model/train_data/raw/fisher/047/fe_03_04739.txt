349.78 351.35 B: [laughter] 

351.46 354.67 B: oh it's easy to do i've almost killed myself plenty of times 

354.16 355.42 A: (( yeah so i )) 

354.76 357.23 B: (( but you know di- probably different circumstances )) 

356.18 358.69 A: i yeah i just couldn't get the hang of it 

358.13 361.95 B: oh it's it's [mn] i i like i i started skiing when i was four years old

362.05 365.49 B: (( and and uh i just loved it so much and it just [mn] )) 

365.45 377.98 B: angers me so [mn] much that i haven't been able to go you know last year it's just so fricking expensive you know like the average average now like vale when i was colorado and i left vale it was sixty two bucks [mn] a day to buy just to buy a lift ticket 

377.94 379.36 A: man [laughter] 

378.72 390.64 B: and if you want to rent the equipment that's another you know cost a hundred bucks but if you own the equipment if you you know you want to buy [mn] decent boots bindings and skis you're dropping at least a grand and [mn] i don't know 

380.82 381.81 A: (( [cough] yeah )) 

387.50 388.78 A: yeah 

390.48 395.69 A: so why did uh did you did you get a good job up there in uh san francisco is that why you went over there or 

395.45 406.69 B: uh actually i started out when i graduated i was um my job was supposed to take me out here but after i went through the training and everything that was right after september eleven so they kind of put everyone in a holding pattern 

406.35 407.24 A: uh-huh 

406.97 411.02 B: and uh when they placed me they put me down in torrance which is in los angeles 

410.49 412.31 A: yeah i i've heard of that place 

411.75 416.00 B: and i already had a i already had a lease and a with my girlfriend up here 

416.05 417.18 B: so 

417.36 427.16 B: like i couldn't i i couldn't break i mean they were willing to break the lease but i mean my girlfriend has already had a job up here [mn] uh so i quit and i moved out here and i started trading and i've been doing that ever since 

422.69 424.08 A: oh okay 

427.08 428.59 A: oh okay 

428.16 437.81 B: so it's it's it's it's you know it's getting by but it's it's tough to get ahead when you know you got so many so many expenses to cover every month you know
