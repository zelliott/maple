65.14 68.50 A: real stories that are behind the pictures and all that kind of 

68.84 75.21 B: [mn] i i'd that's very important that's very important and i encourage you to do that one of uh 

69.01 70.68 A: stuff how 'bout you 

75.19 88.73 B: the greatest and this leads into my hobby one of the greatest problems in my family was no one was interested in our heritage on my father's side until it became almost too late 

88.34 89.57 A: right 

89.19 103.38 B: uh there were rumors i had notes and then one day my brother commissioned me after i retired to find out about our roots and it has been a very exhausting ten years 

103.89 110.27 B: it's been an awarding ten years though and i actually have made it back to about fifteen eighty seven 

110.18 112.11 A: holy cow 

112.36 115.87 B: but it's required four trips to europe 

116.33 124.56 B: and uh i have found that the most unreliable source of information but one that gives you leads is the mormon 

124.87 128.31 B: uh library uh of of uh 

128.36 129.59 B: of uh 

130.07 143.45 B: basically people who came to the united states and where they came from and all that sort of stuff there's a lot of inaccuracy i don't know why but it gets you going sometimes down the right road and 

136.05 137.11 A: mhm 

142.19 144.38 A: oh well hey [mn] 

143.55 148.84 B: so i'm writing now a book about it it's not going to be published it's just for the family 

149.06 155.74 B: but uh it's amazing two different marriages in my family were first cousins [laughter] 

154.76 156.46 A: oh really 

155.54 166.07 B: very frightening my my father used to say well someday we're going to find out that they were all horse thieves but so far i didn't find one horse thief 

156.64 158.21 A: [laughter] 

165.37 169.68 A: [laughter] just first cousins that marry each other [laughter] 

168.72 172.14 B: yeah uh and that included my great 

172.37 177.80 B: great grandfather and his wife were first cousins and came here from hesse dormsted 

177.89 180.40 B: germany in eighteen forty eight 

180.82 181.95 A: oh 

181.46 196.25 B: my mother's side uh is pre revolutionary and they didn't come over in the mayflower but they came over on something after that but my father's family was always a mystery and two cousins were all that remained 

196.53 199.38 B: when i began this project 

198.82 200.12 A: no kidding 

199.67 209.86 B: and it used to be fun they were both thought they were fading they were losing their minds and they would sit there and argue about who great uncle something or other was 

209.78 223.00 B: and suddenly it clicked and i was able to get over to europe and find out where the root began there but you're doing the right thing did your mom and grandmom do things like this 

222.65 225.40 A: no they did not and um 

225.83 232.10 A: and actually we have a ten year old who and i have just recently started this within the last year or so 

232.12 235.61 A: and um it's amazing how much i have already forgotten 

235.72 241.34 A: about his wee teeny little childhood and um 

241.75 255.94 A: i'm really ashamed to say that [laughter] you know i should have been doing this a long time ago um because we uh we have a two year old now and and i'm able to keep up with with what's going on in his life 

249.55 250.60 B: uh-huh 

256.20 260.76 A: at this time but you know i don't have as much for our older son 

261.15 262.67 A: um so 

263.26 270.81 A: i'm at least trying to go back and and catch us up though and at least through their child [mn] through the beginning of their childhood 

271.19 273.57 B: well in my day [sigh] 

271.41 272.54 A: (( but you know )) 

273.97 280.84 B: uh we did not have video cameras as a matter of fact we barely had box cameras brownies 

281.05 283.72 B: and uh so therefore 

283.81 285.00 B: uh 

285.07 287.31 B: the tools today 

287.64 297.29 B: are far more effective uh for documenting what's important but then what are you going to do twenty years from now [laughter] 

297.34 299.84 A: right well in the the 

299.99 301.35 A: the means of 

301.81 304.98 A: playing what we have today may not be 

305.14 307.35 A: around you know when we've already gone from 

307.58 309.19 A: videotape to 

309.35 311.86 A: d._v._d.s and 

311.50 318.02 B: well that's quite true i have some reel to reel tapes of fine musical performances 

312.00 313.65 A: (( you know um )) 

318.14 328.27 B: and i don't have a reel to reel tape player anymore but i found some guy that specializes in putting these on c._d.s 

321.63 323.04 A: right and [mn] 

328.89 330.50 A: oh well that's good 

330.24 337.60 B: so you know if you see the end is near and you take the action it's not cheap i'll tell you that 

337.11 338.86 A: right right 

337.83 342.38 B: probably why i'm making ten dollars a telephone call [laughter] 

340.73 344.49 A: [laughter] yeah me too when you've got a couple of kids 

342.68 345.31 B: but it's it's uh 

346.19 352.99 B: i think that preserving your family is very important because 

353.16 366.72 B: we're a disjointed nation and we he may end up living in iceland or something one son and another son may end up with a career in chile or something and here you are in 

366.79 368.45 B: north carolina 

367.63 374.55 A: right right and i think often times people don't realise how important it is until it's already gone by 

374.83 375.92 A: and um 

376.43 383.73 A: i want to be like my father in law has a box full of pictures from his um parents and 

382.51 383.41 B: uh-huh 

383.78 385.58 A: most of them aren't marked 

385.61 390.16 A: we don't necessarily know who all of the people are and where they were what year it was 

390.53 392.46 A: and you know it's just 

393.33 397.17 A: kind of heartbreaking that there's not something more 

397.64 402.59 A: um defined for each picture when we don't know a lot about 'em but 

402.03 413.24 B: well that uh that we have an exact example like that in our family we have a photograph uh taken on a obviously a national holiday 

413.30 417.97 B: uh it's got banners and things and it's it's done in 

418.33 425.28 B: my great grandfather's home in marietta pennsylvania not georgia pennsylvania [laughter] 

424.46 425.84 A: [laughter] 

425.21 436.93 B: and uh you can tell it's their house because we had other pictures of it and all these people are lined up and one of the women is not in a summer dress she's in black 

437.21 438.55 B: so 

438.87 444.71 B: someone said well that's anna her son had die- her husband had died the year before 

444.48 457.53 B: she was a young widow and there's her two young sons on one side and there's her older daughter and her granddaughter sitting on the other side it must be the older daughter's husband that took the picture 

457.73 463.00 B: well i got my two cousins together and they were both in the picture as infants 

463.22 470.43 B: and i said i'm not going to show you the names on this who are these people and what year is it taken 

470.63 483.06 B: they said leave it with us robert we will work this out we loo- we'll look at the back they matched every name except the widow the two sons and the girl 

482.91 483.88 A: (( mm )) 

483.38 485.11 B: they were neighbors 

485.19 490.48 B: and it wasn't done in nineteen eighteen it was done in nineteen thirteen 

489.97 491.25 A: [laughter] 

491.35 496.80 B: and you know and and they both died within a year otherwise i would never have known who was in that picture 

495.17 498.07 A: (( never [mn] it'd still be a mystery huh )) 

498.17 507.61 B: so we called it the mystery pictures for years but we finally got it straightened out and if you're stepfather can help you with any of them mark them in 

507.77 509.80 A: yeah that's what um 

509.88 522.48 A: we need to have him look at 'em and and see who he can identify and then we're going to get as many of them as we can into a book so that there won't be any question later on down the road 

521.12 524.85 B: well that is a wonderful hobby and i love mine too 

524.81 526.62 A: (( yeah and it's funny how they )) 

525.14 529.54 B: do you have anything else that you back it up with like needlepoint [laughter] 

529.55 534.99 A: no i don't i got a couple of kids i work you know [laughter] [laughter] [mn] i don't have time i 

532.80 537.44 B: oh do you do the artwork in this scrapbook 

537.49 539.16 A: do i do the artwork 

538.55 547.25 B: like headings at the top of the page or or maybe sew borders around certain programs when you put them in rather than just glue them in 

547.39 551.33 A: um i really just do [mn] pretty simply 

551.48 553.78 A: pages i prefer to 

553.99 560.41 A: get the picture in there and get the story written down rather than spend a whole lot of time on decorating 

561.02 563.69 A: um i put a little bit of stuff but not much 

563.46 569.47 B: my sister in law makes workbooks for all of her grandchildren as well as my 

569.58 575.53 B: our el- uh my older brother's grandchildren and they're sort of activity books 

575.99 581.72 B: and she has sort of incorporated this into making scrapbooks 

581.71 593.34 B: for the grandkids as they get older and get into school and they get the pictures and things she has the the plumbers and she glue glues on when they graduate from 

592.68 593.46 A: (( mm )) 

593.52 599.22 B: grammar school and things like that and she's very busy too but she finds this relaxing
