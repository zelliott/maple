66.50 67.50 B: and so 

69.29 74.02 B: yeah i was ten and we were really close with them and so it um 

73.76 74.40 A: (( [noise] ))

81.58 84.56 A: yeah and i've i've tried to stop here and there 

84.22 93.05 B: yeah i don't have a problem with it at all my ex husband was a smoker and it you know it didn't bother me at all it was just my preference not to 

92.81 96.54 A: [noise] [noise] okay so you're saying your husband was a smoker does he smoke inside the house 

96.18 97.09 B: no 

97.19 99.77 B: no i have kids and one of 'em has asthma 

99.35 100.44 A: (( oh okay )) 

100.16 102.95 B: so he was an outside smoker definitely 

101.84 107.50 A: and living in california you know you guys were the first state to have uh the ban on smoking 

106.01 108.49 B: the no s- yeah we were 

108.99 110.43 B: so it was um 

110.84 114.92 B: not really a big deal there never it never has really bothered me 

114.84 119.08 A: okay but i assume you're real happy about that right when when that law happened 

115.23 116.23 B: (( [noise] so )) 

116.94 117.85 B: (( [cough] )) 

118.53 133.05 B: um you know what [noise] it's it never bothered me before all my friends all my friends are smokers all my [sigh] my brother is so i'm i've always been around it so it didn't bother me when the passed i mean in any way it didn't 

122.25 123.24 A: okay 

129.33 130.25 A: okay 

133.75 140.83 B: it didn't change my dining experience or or anything like that [noise] so 

140.56 141.54 A: okay 

141.48 146.69 B: i don't know how about you are you guys still smoking in restaurants back there 

143.03 144.05 A: (( um )) 

146.30 152.43 A: uh yeah out here yeah you still can smoke in restaurants and bars [lipsmack] and 

147.36 148.38 B: really 

151.53 155.19 B: you can in bars here but that's it basically 

153.58 159.83 A: mhm yeah well i've been out to california plenty of times actually i used to live in boulder in colorado and 

156.37 157.60 B: have you [noise] 

158.63 160.44 B: oh oh okay 

159.84 165.78 A: it was interesting because that was a local ban so in boulder you couldn't smoke in restaurants and bars 

165.05 166.99 B: [sigh] oh really [noise] 

166.29 174.47 A: but you know you can drive out i i actually lived fifteen miles up in the miles and you could smoke in the bars there and you can go to denver for instance and smoke 

173.87 174.61 B: huh 

174.52 179.93 A: but uh i you know i actually like it [laughter] even being a smoker how ironic it is but uh 

177.08 178.01 B: you oh 

179.32 181.48 B: yeah that is that's 

180.50 186.02 A: you know it's it's much nicer i think it's much more pleasant especially if you're a non smoker i can definitely understand 

182.86 183.58 B: (( [cough] )) 

184.73 188.77 B: well i think it is for kids i think it's nice 

188.17 189.51 A: sure 

189.01 195.85 B: but like i said for myself it didn't really it didn't really impact me 'cause my friends are all smokers anyways 

195.44 196.40 A: okay 

196.08 199.63 B: so i mean they all started smoking when we were teenagers 

199.31 205.78 A: yeah and it's real interesting 'cause uh around here where i grew up i actually grew up in d._c. there are lots of local municipalities 

205.35 206.93 B: oh okay 

206.02 216.87 A: so for instance they could try to do their own laws or stuff like that and one community here tried to ban public like smoking outright completely it was in two 

210.29 211.46 B: oh really 

215.96 219.06 B: [noise] oh that's so stupid i think that's stupid 

218.06 223.15 A: oh it was ridiculous i- in the sense that you couldn't walk on the sidewalks and smoke a cigarette 

221.88 227.46 B: yeah [noise] so it's stupid that's like you can't drive in your car with the cigarette [noise] 

226.98 232.97 A: that was one of the only places you're allowed to and it's funny you know it was absolutely ridiculous i thought you know 

229.68 231.03 B: really 

232.08 236.02 B: that yeah that is that's that is ridiculous [noise] 

235.14 239.85 A: 'cause i can understand you know honestly i can understand even being a smoker you know not you know 

239.95 241.53 A: there are health concerns 

241.36 242.93 B: right but 

241.86 244.84 A: about it but you know it's and you know 

243.84 252.09 B: but that's a that's a little over the edge [laughter] [noise] that's a little over the edge [noise] so 

245.76 248.14 A: oh that was very much over the edge 

253.29 257.64 A: okay but for instance your husband's always smoked does he really tried to stop 

256.73 257.80 B: (( [noise] um )) 

257.96 265.10 B: he tried for a little bit but he tried when our son was first born he tried to quit but um 

265.44 266.82 B: he just couldn't 

267.08 268.06 B: so 

268.43 274.43 B: he uh he still smokes but outside and and um when he's not around the kids [noise] 

274.59 275.59 A: (( oh okay )) 

275.32 278.20 B: so but [cough] it's [mn] 

278.84 284.74 B: no bother [noise] it's just an ex- just another expense though the way it that's the way i look at it 

284.09 286.66 A: sure and they're very expensive in california 

285.93 288.29 B: yeah yeah i know that um 

288.52 291.38 B: they're about four bucks a pack 

290.86 294.92 A: mhm like in new york city they're actually seven dollars a pack 

294.43 297.35 B: really [noise] wow 

295.11 297.94 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

297.97 299.29 B: wow 

298.03 304.80 A: and it's and it's funny 'cause living in d._c. it's more expensive in d._c. and maryland but cheaper in virginia 'cause it's all about the state taxes 

304.54 305.75 B: uh-huh [noise] 

305.12 306.04 A: you know 

306.10 312.73 B: yeah and [noise] geez that's expensive i thought we were expensive i though we were real expensive 

312.75 314.11 B: (( so [noise] [noise] )) 

312.93 324.30 A: you know and i think it's it's a deterrent to sell 'em especially to the young which is good you know 'cause money you know m- you know younger kids who are you know basically you know the people start smoking you know that's a lotta money 

316.60 317.62 B: right 

317.84 318.87 B: (( [noise] right )) 

322.94 328.35 B: yeah yeah it is it's [noise] you know more than their lunch money [laughter] 

327.18 332.31 A: yeah that's fine you know i have no problems about that you know if people wanna smoke they gotta pay for it in that sense 

331.62 334.27 B: uh yeah yeah that's true 

334.37 341.52 B: that's true although i do like all the promotional offers they have for them when you save all the points 

341.25 343.62 A: [noise] [laughter] sure have you been collecting points 

343.15 346.64 B: oh you bet i have i collect 'em off the ground [laughter] 

345.53 348.26 A: off what marlborough or camel or both 

347.72 350.29 B: anything [laughter] any of 'em 

349.08 351.34 A: and what have you gotten what's the best thing you've gotten 

350.41 358.57 B: um [lipsmack] from marlborough we got a really nice tackle bag um for fishing we've gotten 

358.90 361.34 B: oh my gosh last year we got 

361.48 366.77 B: ten things you know the maximum per household just from me picking 'em up 

364.90 366.16 A: well that's good 

366.19 370.73 A: [laughter] that's good that's that's utilizing your resources right there 

367.84 368.84 B: (( so )) 

369.78 374.13 B: that's right you know hey if they don't want it for free pers- i want i want it for free 

373.61 374.68 A: sure 

374.53 383.77 B: so and um from newport we've gotten you know gas cards fifty dollar gas cards and um yeah yeah and people are s- you know 

379.75 382.46 A: wow [laughter] 

383.89 388.05 B: that's their little premium they're throwing away i'll take it 

387.46 388.50 A: sure oh 

388.31 394.67 B: so my brother he's a camel smoker and he's um always saved the camel bucks always 

394.45 397.10 A: so he just he just gives 'em to you he doesn't care about 'em 

396.51 406.73 B: no he i- he is started actually doing um the promotions for 'em he just saves them up for a couple of years so he can get the best thing he can 

404.30 405.37 A: (( oh okay )) 

407.50 415.43 A: mm-kay so uh like for instance is i think one of the questions it asks is like well you know if you smoked have you ever tried a class or something like that 

407.67 408.57 B: so 

415.24 416.53 B: (( mm a uh huh uh )) 

415.71 421.23 A: you know has your husband ever tried you know like a formal type of class or he just tried to do it cold turkey 

420.67 421.82 B: cold turkey 

421.60 423.02 A: (( [noise] mm-kay )) 

422.50 427.91 B: cold turkey but it's never never worked so i have a friend who did hypnosis 

428.43 429.46 B: and uh 

428.47 431.45 A: and has that worked at all or did it have partial success 

430.05 435.62 B: it worked for two weeks [laughter] it worked for two weeks and then she just couldn't take it anymore 

432.01 432.60 A: [mn] 

436.16 440.84 B: so and she had tried you know the patch the gum all that stuff 

436.28 437.49 A: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh [noise] )) 

440.94 445.35 B: nothing was working so she tried the hypnosis and that failed her too 

445.21 447.97 A: (( [noise] okay [noise] )) 

448.53 450.76 B: so i don't know [sigh] so 

451.32 459.11 B: it's all another expense and so she spent a lotta money trying to quit and and uh nothing's worked so 

458.02 462.81 A: [noise] mm sure but then again it's all money [laughter] you know that's all it is 

460.79 462.22 B: (( yeah that's true )) 

462.66 464.81 B: yeah that's true i guess 

465.00 466.48 B: (( so [cough] )) 

467.06 471.70 B: she um she's still smoking a couple of packs pack and a half a day though 

472.12 473.65 A: oh wow that's a lot 

472.75 475.45 B: so that's when it's an expensive habit definitely 

475.51 477.46 A: (( yeah well how much do you think your husband smokes )) 

477.29 478.58 B: um 

478.64 485.75 B: at the most a half a pack at the very most that's on the day you know if he's even out at the bar 

480.37 481.31 A: okay 

486.42 487.41 B: so 

487.46 492.20 B: usually it's more like five six cigarettes a day at the most 

492.03 492.97 A: (( mm-kay )) 

492.89 496.76 B: but it can get up to a half a pack a day never more than that though so 

498.84 504.60 A: so like for instance like if you know i assume you like you've seen a parent smoking around their kid before right 

504.02 505.38 B: oh yeah 

504.75 507.21 A: you know does that you know does that bother you at all 

506.89 507.87 B: um 

508.46 515.13 B: sometimes it [mn] it depends you know if i see them driving in the car and all the windows are rolled up that bothers me 

515.53 520.93 B: or um uh but i mean if it's in an open area not really 

520.58 523.37 A: [noise] sure sure like out in the park for instance 

522.78 525.05 B: yeah no not all then 

526.36 527.73 B: and so um 

528.10 533.74 B: it just depends on the on the circumstances if it's completely closed up then yeah it does bother me 

533.35 534.30 A: sure 

534.06 538.00 B: but if it's an open area it's a public open area then no it doesn't 

538.96 539.80 B: so 

540.31 543.62 B: and it also depends on how that person feels about it themselves 

544.00 544.88 B: you know 

544.63 545.47 A: sure 

545.40 547.10 B: i can't tell someone how 

547.53 551.23 B: how to do things with their own kids i don't want 'em telling me how to do things with mine 

552.45 553.36 B: so 

556.21 557.56 B: (( i don't know [sigh] )) 

557.51 558.58 A: [laughter] 

557.95 558.56 B: (( [laughter] )) 

558.86 560.60 B: i don't know [laughter] 

560.95 562.35 B: (( [noise] 'cause um )) 

564.18 567.36 B: [lipsmack] well i don't know what to ask you i mean 

567.49 570.50 B: you coming from the whole other end of the spectrum though 

570.64 572.99 A: (( sure yeah well i you know i'm like )) 

573.44 579.65 A: i stopped the last time i stopped actually was from december to may oh not may to march 

577.92 578.98 B: (( oh well that )) 

579.51 581.41 B: that's a good amount of time 

580.91 582.28 A: oh very much so 

581.44 583.12 B: (( how come you went back )) 

582.76 584.11 A: um 

584.40 587.15 A: it was just like the immediate gratification i guess 

586.72 589.19 B: oh yeah yeah 

587.40 593.86 A: you know 'cause the the the thing about smoking is you know i always like it [laughter] and i still like it 

591.98 593.06 B: yeah 

593.30 595.67 B: and most people who smoke do like it it 

595.00 599.95 A: sure you know it's just i shouldn't do it and so when i wasn't doing it it doesn't 

596.08 596.88 B: (( must )) 

597.41 599.58 B: yeah yeah and i know
