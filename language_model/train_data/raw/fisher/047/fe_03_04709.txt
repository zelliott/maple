57.10 65.07 B: the the b- boss you know isn't part of the equation but as a self employed person i'm i'm always sort of [sigh] you know my work is my hobby so i don't know i'm 

59.94 60.50 A: (( [sigh] )) 

65.17 68.17 A: so in other words you like what you do [laughter] 

65.24 67.27 B: (( [lipsmack] i guess i'm i )) 

67.14 69.87 B: like what i do [sigh] but i guess i guess you know i 

69.78 82.78 B: i maybe a better definition of hobby is something that you sort of do more than most people [sigh] like everybody may walk but if you sort of have walking shoes and go you know for long walks like i probably go to way more movies than the average person so i could say [noise] 

82.67 85.24 B: i guess i could say movie going is is a hobby 

85.70 87.58 B: (( [noise] you know something like that )) 

85.99 91.83 A: okay well i guess i'm like you my hobby is my work too is ah [lipsmack]

106.56 111.13 A: includes ah fixing 'em and i do basically everything 

111.48 114.36 A: from h- handing them out to keeping 'em running [sigh] [sigh] 

115.20 123.72 B: [mn] ha [mn] and so when you for a hobby that's the work side and when when you're playing around after work [noise] what do you do with them like design web sites or surf the web or 

123.51 128.50 A: ah surf the web play games ah you know build my own fix other people's [sigh] 

123.87 124.43 B: (( [sigh] ))

131.00 131.73 A: (( [sigh] u- )) 

132.01 133.20 B: yeah 

132.45 146.23 A: um [sigh] i i guess movies would be a big one too i don't go to see the movies because if i take the wife or myself or me and my son it's like twenty twenty five dollars so i tend to w- wait until they come out on dvd 

145.65 147.82 B: yeah yeah 

146.59 148.95 A: [sigh] but i've got about a thousand of those [sigh]

149.63 150.71 A: [laughter] 

150.06 152.31 B: yeah that would qualify as hobby i'd say 

152.48 156.27 A: [sigh] or is it a hobby or an obsession when you cross that line 

154.86 158.30 B: [laughter] [laughter] yeah [sigh] mm 

158.51 163.16 B: [lipsmack] how about are you the kind of person who's hobbies change over time like [sigh] you know 

163.17 171.62 B: in high in college it this is the big obsession and then it's this and you then you get married and things change or [sigh] are your hobbies sort of consistent over time 

171.18 174.04 A: [noise] well the computers have been consistent since 

174.06 178.17 A: grade well not grade school more like ah junior high 

178.44 179.47 A: i mean 

178.66 179.52 B: yeah 

179.73 185.85 A: considering i'm thirty five that's like way back when when they first started you know when palm was high tech [sigh] 

185.46 186.93 B: exactly 

186.37 187.92 A: [laughter] 

188.25 189.96 A: (( [lipsmack] so ah )) 

190.38 201.03 A: [lipsmack] no that that one's stayed pretty much the same i i you know i've got little side things like i've got a f- an aquar- a sixty gallon aquarium i've done the salt water a- aquarium 

201.09 202.54 B: right 

202.77 212.67 B: right i g- guess a hobby becomes something that you know more about than the average person like ah you know i don't know anything about aquariums so 

203.24 203.97 A: (( but [noise] [noise] )) 

213.70 214.56 B: (( you know )) 

214.84 218.42 B: i guess if you know something about it it qualifies [noise] 

218.21 223.90 A: [sigh] right well it's like y- you know it it is a hobby but it's not you know it's it's 

224.15 231.43 A: more just you know something i do very infrequently as opposed to like computers or movies which is almost a daily thing 

231.21 237.80 B: right oh i know a hobby i have i i didn't even think of this [sigh] um i've built and painted all my own furniture 

238.12 242.43 B: so that's kind of d- different [sigh] yeah that works out pretty well 

238.18 239.13 A: oh 

242.97 244.45 B: [sigh] it it was amazing i 

243.33 245.28 A: (( yeah that's [sigh] ah [noise] one )) 

244.62 255.71 B: i just went down to a salvation army and you know found a twenty twenty five dollar dresser that looked like crap and then just [sigh] fixed it up a little putty some glue you know and a couple of nails 

255.61 270.56 B: [sigh] and then i would paint it just crazy wild caribbean colors and [sigh] they turned into real c- collectors pieces everybody comments on 'em [noise] [lipsmack] i made a couple of dressers magazine racks a dining room table chairs coffee table [sigh] even um modified some halogen lamps and 

270.54 279.42 B: you know some odds and ends [sigh] ah standing there all kinds of stuff most of the stuff in here p- probably is made by my own hand in some fashion 

280.41 285.80 A: of the things you know i'd like to do but you know i've got to do that work thing 

285.13 286.43 B: (( right [sigh] )) 

285.76 287.67 A: [laughter] and [sigh] 

287.59 301.73 A: work does allow me to p- partially work out of my house because basically i serve a whole bunch of remote sites approximately forty to forty two remote sites [sigh] so i i've i spend a lot of time driving i guess music would be another hobby [sigh] i'm 

296.10 297.51 B: (( [lipsmack] really )) 

301.93 303.28 A: [sigh] putting all my 

303.41 310.55 A: ah c._d.s on m._p. threes i've got about five hundred i'm in the ws for the artists and then it's the compilation disks [sigh] [sigh] 

310.39 322.50 B: oh so so you you're b- burning 'em from the a- audio c._d. on to the hard drive of your computer and m._p. wh- what i'm just curious i mean why why are you doing that i mean i know why people like [sigh] 

322.28 328.19 B: download m._p. threes to to n- not pay for it but if you already have the c._d. is it because you want to like make your own 

328.26 331.74 B: tape and cut out the crappy s- songs and stuff or 

328.64 329.53 A: well 

331.56 336.93 A: well the grand plan is to put a computer hooked up to the stereo that i could play my music through 

336.11 340.47 B: [sigh] [sigh] oh [laughter] so like a master computerized jukebox kind of thing right 

339.76 346.65 A: exactly and i use a piece of software called mood logic [sigh] which ah categorizes your song by 

340.90 342.39 B: (( o- oh )) 

346.91 348.43 A: a bunch of different 

348.56 352.49 A: st- statistics [sigh] and you can pick a song and create a mix 

350.03 352.05 B: what's it called moo- mood logic 

352.38 353.25 B: (( oh )) 

354.42 356.65 B: mood did you say it was mood logic 

356.34 357.82 A: (( [sigh] [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

357.25 358.28 B: (( oh okay )) 

358.54 359.83 A: it it's 

359.92 371.78 A: when i initially got on it it was free and then if you ah categorized the songs that they didn't already have you'd earn like credits and now it's like twenty dollars and they do ah like 

371.72 383.60 A: [sigh] sort of ten thousand songs something like that it's not as comprehensive as your music collection would be if you were doing it the way i'm doing it off of c._d.s because i'm getting in all the songs you know 

375.55 376.53 B: [noise] interesting 

383.85 384.72 B: right 

383.89 386.54 A: every artist has one great album 

386.60 394.26 A: or you know there are the artists you know they've got one great album that you know there's no duds on it and then there's others that's got one hit wonder [sigh] 

393.99 394.91 B: yeah 

394.71 395.28 A: (( [noise] ))

402.94 404.36 A: in the car 

404.46 406.61 A: um so i can you know 

405.45 412.77 B: how does that work [lipsmack] is that a piece of hard how does that work is that like a piece of hardware that you plug into the the cigarette lighter 

407.08 408.00 A: what's that [noise] 

411.51 417.63 A: well no actually this one's a you burn your c._d. on your computer and just toss it into 

417.65 418.21 B: (( [sigh] )) 

418.02 421.80 A: a a c._d. player basically it plays c._d.s also 

421.59 434.42 B: now i tried doing that what am i doing wrong i i burned ah mp- you know an audio c._d. and um [sigh] it plays okay on my home boom box but when i put it in my car c._d. player it it doesn't play other 

430.94 431.92 A: (( uh-hum )) 

434.34 438.98 B: so you have a special p- player that you had to put in your car to play these or something [lipsmack] o- 

437.71 445.56 A: well the one the one that i got is because it's designed to play m._p. threes so it actually plays data files 

445.92 447.78 B: o- oh 

447.85 452.94 A: so i can put you know a hundred songs on a c._d. as opposed to ten [laughter]
