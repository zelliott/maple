73.03 80.94 A: well that was in our younger days i would imagine you know i i would imagine that it was in our younger days that we had uh 

76.14 77.11 B: say again 

81.08 82.70 A: you know more hobbies 

82.85 92.24 B: well at least [mn] yeah more hobbies and time to pursue interest i don't know but uh i mean i suppose that i think they asked us uh if uh hobbies are important

102.12 103.50 B: i don't know if they're 

106.13 117.37 B: i suppose you know for me i that's a good point your own worth you know maybe i feel decent enough about myself to where i don't feel like i want to have any hobbies i don't know but i know in the past the hobbies made me feel good about myself you know 

108.93 109.88 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

113.09 114.28 A: well that's [mn] 

116.44 127.56 A: yeah but see again you you'll live life through your eyes and you see the world only the way you see it so you make the call you know you're in charge other than the guy that's paying you 

127.53 135.13 A: you know the boss that's paying you you got to do what he says 'cause he's the boss but other than that you're in charge so 

128.36 129.39 B: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

135.23 147.24 A: you're a reasonable individual right you have to know and assume that you're reasonable enough that you're fair enough with everybody around you that i can call the shots the way i call 'em you know 

147.21 161.32 B: i suppose yeah i mean i didn't look at it in those terms i was thinking hey you know uh i mean i never i haven't even thought about my hobbies too much uh recently i just as i said my life i'm relatively happy you know and and when i do have time like i said i i don't even 

148.17 149.13 A: (( mm mm )) 

153.52 155.24 A: (( mm yeah )) 

160.41 162.41 A: mhm pursue it 

161.63 167.10 B: you know i i tend to not even feel like doing some of the things i did uh you know but 

163.77 164.69 A: (( yeah )) 

165.23 171.83 A: mm and then you have to look back and wonder why at times though you know you you wonder why haven't i even 

171.70 181.38 A: go into it like even building my uh model uh planes i used to do that i used to love that i haven't done that in ten fifteen years now not even 

177.17 178.60 B: mhm 

181.59 184.37 A: stop in the store and looked at one you know 

184.34 187.52 B: you you know what you know what's funny is uh 

186.04 186.91 A: (( mm )) 

187.72 190.61 B: uh a while back i got a uh 

190.71 200.92 B: uh you know my father in law said stuff to me like hey you know what if your hobbies don't lead to anything you know you're going to find that you don't you know that they're not going to last he said something like that 

195.75 196.70 A: (( right )) 

200.49 201.67 A: right 

200.75 207.33 B: and uh you know what at the time i was really into what i was doing you know all of my little hobbies and they were pretty pointless and useless stuff 

203.67 204.93 A: (( mm )) 

206.47 207.49 A: okay 

207.34 213.14 B: and uh now as it turns out he was kind of correct on that you know he's not my father in law any- 

211.14 217.55 A: yeah i grabbed the point when you said it to me i said yeah he's right [laughter] that's right 

216.53 227.34 B: [laughter] you know so you know i mean what was i doing that was so i was so into i i don't even remember but i was just so into these little things i think they had to do with gardening and stuff 

222.74 224.08 A: mhm 

224.93 226.03 A: (( yeah )) 

226.66 227.97 A: mhm 

227.34 232.46 B: and uh ultimately he's been proven right right now at least 

230.64 233.39 A: yeah yeah i understand what he's saying 

232.99 235.41 B: but as far as importance of hobbies 

234.82 236.22 A: mhm 

235.54 245.07 B: you know i think that they play- they were pretty important to me uh maybe ten or fifteen years ago when i was in my teens and early twenties and all that but uh 

243.69 244.61 A: (( [mn] )) 

244.85 253.41 B: now at this particular stage in my life maybe my kids are my hobbies maybe i maybe i just don't even know what my hobbies are you know i have a hobby in trying to make money
