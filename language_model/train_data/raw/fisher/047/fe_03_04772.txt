2.53 3.73 B: hello 

3.52 5.86 A: ah hey what's up man ah my name's mike 

5.53 6.70 B: my name's dan 

6.55 8.15 A: ah what's up man how are you 

7.81 9.49 B: (( good good how are you )) 

9.40 13.40 A: um doing all right um do we just ah start talking now 

12.87 14.01 B: yeah 

13.61 19.18 A: okay um well i guess the topic that they gave us is smoking ah so 

18.18 20.43 B: banned in public places yeah 

19.77 21.40 A: ah do you smoke 

20.81 21.57 B: no 

21.43 28.23 A: no ah i do actually so ah smoking in public places is something that i take for granted and ah you 

21.59 22.35 B: you 

28.30 37.34 A: know i'd prefer that most places don't ban it but you know there are some times when i think that it's pretty appropriate like for example 

36.01 40.63 B: well i i was a smoker i i quit several years ago and it's the 

41.30 53.64 B: i think it if i had you know been a smoker if those rules had been in effect there like today i quit about ten years ago i would've had a real tough time with 'em oh yeah i mean i used to smoke in my office all day long 

50.11 51.25 A: really 

53.50 58.69 A: oh that then well i go to a well are you are you a member of pen staff or 

58.10 59.01 B: no 

58.53 68.85 A: anything i don't know okay so i'm a member of like pen's ah student body and i know that smoking um in offices isn't allowed at all so 

68.55 73.82 B: yeah when i when i smoking it was you know you'd it was your office you close the door did whatever you want 

69.49 70.76 A: people still do it 

73.83 81.68 A: well do you think i mean do you think that it's it's appropriate for people to make regulations about that today 

81.33 84.73 B: i [mn] i have a tough time with it i really do 

84.76 94.83 B: when you stop smoking you kind of you don't like it anymore but yet you know you remember how you felt smokers are kind of a persecuted minority 

94.71 107.94 A: yeah i agree with you because i mean as far like people people have sympathy i think for people who are addicted to other things you know and as far as cigarettes go i guess 'cause they're so distasteful to so many people that 

107.74 119.11 A: you know they just wanna get them the hell out like you know like smoking in restaurants i think and smoking like at mall or something like that i think that's inappropriate you know there's just there's no need to do that but [noise] i don't think 

117.91 128.22 B: well it it it's funny because i mean i'm i don't know how old you are but i'm almost fifty and [laughter] growing up it was like people on t._v. smoked everybody smoked you know 

126.85 138.60 A: yeah i i notice that too i'm only i'm only twenty um but i see that i watch ah o- older programs and i see like for example the twilight zone you know you see rod serling you know like smoking away 

136.96 140.10 B: oh he died from it [laughter] 

138.88 140.59 A: he died from cancer 

140.21 141.15 B: huh 

140.85 142.36 A: did he die from cancer 

141.56 147.38 B: no he he died from ah smoking related heart disease they were he he died in surgery 

145.35 146.32 A: really 

147.25 148.52 A: oh wow 

147.68 149.96 B: yeah they were operating on his heart 

149.28 150.39 A: i did not know 

150.21 151.43 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

150.24 150.91 A: that that's 

150.83 152.78 A: interesting twilight zone trivia 

152.20 153.16 B: (( yeah it )) 

152.76 158.16 A: but ah yeah you never see anyone smoke on t._v. anymore and it's it's a little unnatural 

158.15 171.84 A: i think because there i i walk around outside and i see people like smoking down the street and when i watch t._v. and the only time they show you someone smoking is to point out that is person should not be smoking you know there's something inauthentic about that 

170.81 181.02 B: it's very it's ver- considering you know the the number of people in america of what i understand is it's still after all the anti smoking messages and 

180.61 181.54 A: (( [noise] )) 

181.12 188.95 B: ah nineteen sixty four was the surgeon general's ah ban i still think there's about twenty five percent smokers in this country 

188.69 197.93 A: well you know i think those messages are pretty ineffective i mean i i see them all the time i i pick up a pack of cigarettes i see the surgeon general's warning and i think to myself you know 

197.79 208.94 A: the only the only way i'm gonna stop smoking is if i really decide it's not you know it's not for me and i think i think that's true i mean when you when you quit is what made you quit 

208.53 218.76 B: i started to feel lousy i had been smoking and ah i got a cold and i couldn't shake it and i was in a car with a buddy he was driving and i started to cough 

218.92 228.78 B: and i i just couldn't stop coughing and i came home i said to my wife that's it and she started laughing i said no i'm really i'm done and that was it i was afraid 

220.77 222.04 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

227.01 228.17 A: hey that's good 

228.28 231.01 A: my friend ah one of my friends actually 

230.93 238.68 A: i i feel bad because i think i may have started him smoking ah just because he was around us so often he started bumming cigarettes from us but ah 

238.50 240.94 A: he had a perpetual cold from 

240.75 255.72 A: like mid january to the end of february because he just smoked and smoked and drank and didn't absolutely nothing to take of himself and i was like you know maybe you should stop smoking but he was like oh yeah he was like well i don't i don't think anything's gonna happen to me and i was like well 

255.13 257.46 B: [noise] [noise] well i was one of the dumb people 

255.54 257.06 A: (( you know yeah )) 

257.67 259.15 A: yeah i don't 

258.08 260.60 B: i started smoking when i was twenty seven 

261.19 262.47 B: that's pretty dumb 

262.67 264.04 A: (( know i mean )) 

263.26 265.33 B: most people start when they're younger 

265.48 278.25 A: i i guess it's just it's a novelty thing you know like that's kind of how i started and also because of just like drinking friends you know and whatever like people offer you a cigarette so 

267.66 268.39 B: (( you )) 

268.81 269.75 B: (( know )) 

278.23 283.68 A: you say fine what the hell i mean i'm already i'm already destroying my body with alcohol [laughter] 

282.83 289.96 B: well it it you know [sigh] the la- legislating against cigarettes it's kind of like there are a lot of other vices 

289.60 290.18 A: (( you )) 

290.02 302.91 B: and yet that seems to be the one that everybody jumps on board with and you know attacks the hell out of people ah some of the things i f- the things i think are ridiculous are the some of the open air bans i've seen 

303.16 305.76 A: (( you mean like you can't smoke outside )) 

305.17 306.68 B: (( yeah )) 

306.10 308.93 A: (( where like in in ah where have you heard this )) 

308.71 312.50 B: um i'm i'm thinking san francisco but i'm not positive 

311.99 314.78 A: [mn] i'd believe that [noise] and 

313.66 316.91 B: yeah yeah well that that would be about par for them 

316.33 330.38 A: yeah i think that's a a little idiotic because i mean who can legislate like y- your air around you when sooner or later you won't be able speak in these areas because it's designated like a quiet zone or something like that you know 

330.25 331.13 B: (( i know )) 

330.54 339.19 A: so i don't know i think i think that's ah a little ridiculous but yeah most of my friends still smoke but all of us are kind of trying to quit but 

338.40 342.53 B: well it's funny 'cause when i [mn] i i sing in a singing group and 

341.81 343.51 A: mhm 

342.51 351.68 B: ah when we first started there were five of us and everybody smoked and now none of us smokes it's like as you get older you realise that someday you are gonna die 

351.63 359.50 B: you know we started about fifteen years ago when everybody was in their thirties and now it's like oh shit you know and everybody just quit 

352.55 353.42 A: yeah 

359.87 371.48 A: well i i mean it it's a good it's a good thing i mean like you know obviously it's good that you stopped smoking and you know sooner or later i know i'm gonna stop i'm i'm kind of dwindling down but you know there are like moments when um 

371.27 376.07 A: like i don't know kind of stressed out or what have you and those are [noise] definitely times 

375.32 383.33 B: oh yeah when you i mean when you stop you know everybody tells you oh you know it's great they don't tell you that it's like losing your best friend [laughter] it's what [laughter] 

383.04 385.69 A: yeah yeah that's true i mean 

383.56 384.32 B: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

384.73 387.40 B: it's like i was in mourning for three weeks you know 

386.62 390.41 A: [laughter] well i actually ah 

390.89 397.67 A: when i stopped when i stopped for a brief period um i kind of went off the handle i was really ah 

397.69 399.51 A: really irritable [laughter] 

398.63 400.19 B: oh yeah 

401.21 415.26 A: i mean it's it's a it's it's not only just like it's the habit it's just like the actual the nicotine you know it it affects you i mean [noise] i in in a good way you know when you're smoking and it's good to get that nicotine rush or you know it's [noise] 

407.68 408.55 B: sure 

415.49 416.23 A: but 

415.68 421.23 B: i always found it funny when people would tell me to quit the one thing i wanted most of all at that time was a cigarette 

421.30 425.60 B: you know it was like they were don't stress me out give me a cigarette [laughter] 

424.35 428.04 A: (( yeah oh yeah but you know what it's it's funny when you mention that because )) 

427.89 432.81 A: to me that's like i i don't know i call this like the trigger effect and any time 

432.66 434.47 A: any time i see someone 

434.30 444.11 A: ah smoking a cigarette on t._v. or a movie or a friend it's like or someone ta- takes one out of their pack it's like snap your fingers right there [noise] that's like the trigger you know 

443.72 444.97 B: oh yeah 

443.93 458.30 A: it it starts me smoking i see ah someone's pulling it out and i say to my friend i'd be like god damn you you know you fucking bastard you know you got me to smoke a cigarette and then out comes my pack i mean it's poor will power on my part but either way you know 

457.11 462.36 B: i just well my daughter's your age she's nineteen and i keep worrying that she's gonna start she hasn't yet 

462.67 466.88 B: i've never seen her smoke yet and she doesn't smell like smoke yet so 

464.46 465.65 A: ah well 

466.12 473.58 A: yeah i [noise] i you know like she if she it's probably good that she hasn't but [noise] she ah she's probably tried 

474.55 483.13 B: oh yeah but i mean it if she was smoking i'd you know it's amazing when you stop how you can smell it on other people when you're smoking you can't [laughter] you know when you stop you can 

480.31 481.14 A: but 

481.45 494.53 A: [mn] yeah yeah it you're you're blind to it so when people when people or i don't even know what the word is for that but um yeah i've had the same thing i i start smelling it in my friends rooms when i haven't smoked and you know it's it's 

491.77 493.09 B: mhm 

494.51 501.93 A: [mn] not a horrible smell to me it's definitely unpleasant but it also you know it reminds me of smoking [noise] so 

501.70 513.39 B: well the longer you been away from it you know the more it bothers it you and not not so much the actual somebody actually smoking but the smell afterward the lingering smell on the clothes that does bother you but 

503.49 504.72 A: [noise] 

510.33 511.19 A: yeah 

513.47 518.66 B: ah like i tell my wife i say if they diagnose me with a terminal disease right to seven eleven for cigarettes 

518.45 520.37 A: [laughter] 

518.97 523.83 B: she she gets angry but i say i'm dead serious i'm that's you know

530.93 533.81 A: did she did she always take issue with that like she 

533.11 538.30 B: never that's the part that's part of the problem she figured you you know you wanna do it fine 

535.40 536.87 A: oh really that she 

538.70 539.82 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

538.71 540.53 B: (( you know that's ah and )) 

540.63 548.46 B: we were both you know i mean we were younger she was like twenty four when i started smoking so she deci- see i we had been older she would have hassled me 

545.80 546.84 A: she 

548.42 558.68 A: i see yeah i i can understand that because i guess it's just you know everyone i mean i think it's a good approach to to let people be and you know let them make their own decisions but 

549.09 550.28 B: (( you know so )) 

557.94 561.99 B: but i remember in work th- there was a woman i worked with and she had just stopped

580.25 584.45 A: well okay yeah i mean that's that's fair i mean i guess on her part 

584.23 596.77 A: you know like it is it is a bit condescending of her to comment and say you know i quit you should stop because it's bad let me tell you why i mean you know why smoking is bad i know why smoking is bad yet
