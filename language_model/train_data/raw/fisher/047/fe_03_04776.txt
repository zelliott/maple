15.16 16.13 A: (( yeah i do )) 

16.71 21.22 B: i i'm a d. j. by trade and ah it just kills 

21.24 31.56 B: like that i know i've tried to work in new york before and everywhere that my friends work ah you know they're just dying from having no customers 'cause people don't want to go out if they can't smoke 

31.64 34.79 A: that's right that's right you know i think 

32.51 34.08 B: so [noise] 

35.09 37.12 A: smoking needs you know 

37.51 43.65 A: yes it's a problem but you know it doesn't kill people like drunk drivers or anything else 

40.64 41.27 B: (( oh )) 

44.10 46.44 A: and they're really hard on it 

46.15 55.63 B: well i i understand the idea of you know banning smoking in in y- y- malls and stuff like that but when it comes to bars 

55.69 64.71 B: you know that's it's a place where adults to go to drink and enjoy themselves and if you can't handle the air or say the smoke you should try a different bar 

64.44 69.18 A: well that's true you know like well vegas they pretty well smoke every place 

69.10 71.09 B: yeah 

69.77 77.48 A: you know except ah there's a few casinos that are non smoking out there you know and they ought to do that i mean to 

77.61 80.65 A: go into a restaurant and i smoke still 

80.41 81.49 B: okay 

80.93 85.21 A: but to go into a restaurant and be told you can't smoke 

85.39 87.00 A: ah you know 

87.74 91.53 A: lot of people like [noise] you know that's the cigarette that you enjoy 

91.72 94.86 A: you know is right after a meal 

94.68 107.97 A: and you know the restaurant owners theirself doesn't have a choice either because they're told you know that nobody'll smoke in their establishment which really stinks because you know they have no say so theirself 

109.60 121.49 A: and it's you know it's tough to like you said ev- especially in a bar it is really tough to get people in there to smoke or you know not to smoke and drink 

120.93 125.01 B: yeah especially in places where it's not always convenient to go outside 

124.86 126.40 A: that's right 

125.16 131.74 B: anywhere i know up north in the winter nobody wants to put on three jackets to go stand in the snow for a smoke 

131.62 133.42 A: yeah 

132.01 135.38 B: they just hang out in the house instead 

134.73 144.15 A: yeah well i'm in colorado too and i see that you know and a lot of people just go out there take a few puffs and throw it away you know so 

143.18 144.53 B: yeah 

144.61 148.82 A: um you know it's and then you got the problem of litter outside 

148.76 162.76 B: yeah i was just reading an article about that in new york city they're spending millions of the dollars that they were supposed to be that they were making in extra taxes on cigarettes now they're spending all that money hiring extra people to clean up cigarette butts 

162.50 164.26 A: (( [noise] right )) 

163.45 165.87 B: 'cause there's so many out 

165.12 168.58 A: yeah yeah you know they need to do something to ah 

168.84 174.11 A: change it um you know but that's not the way to do it 

174.12 179.09 B: yeah it it's hard it's hard to to find a medium between 

174.28 175.41 A: (( with [mn] )) 

179.87 183.95 B: personal rights and and public rights in a in a situation like that 

183.53 186.41 A: right right yeah and i i'm 

185.81 192.82 B: 'cause there are people with legitimate health concerns beyond just you know this is gonna give me lung cancer in forty years 

192.76 193.91 A: right 

192.89 196.90 B: and it it it's also unfair to them that they can't go enjoy their favorite ah 

197.58 202.17 B: places to be just because other people have to smoke 

201.59 209.93 A: right right and you know yes um you know what really gets me though [mn] is like you'll see people that have oxygen 

209.99 211.63 A: that smoke 

211.31 212.68 B: (( yeah )) 

212.03 213.72 A: and it's like you know 

213.82 217.88 A: you shouldn't be doing that you know with your oxygen tank on 

217.73 220.78 B: yeah that's for sure that's um not safe 

218.38 220.50 A: (( and you know )) 

221.13 226.47 A: [noise] yeah and they you know they do it and ah you know but the people that truly 

227.05 231.32 A: you know have a problem and don't wanna be around it 

231.71 236.84 A: you know i do believe okay then you know that we ought to do something for you 

237.38 238.56 A: but um 

239.07 240.92 A: these one people that um 

241.33 244.36 A: you know oh yeah i don't like your smoke you know 

244.53 247.40 A: because it you know i have health problems 

247.64 248.90 A: and um 

250.11 258.25 A: they um you know continue like go into a bar or something like that you know i don't have no consideration for 'em there was a 

258.30 267.24 A: they talked about it on the radio a week or two ago because ah they're trying to get i'm in colorado and they're trying to get denver non smoking 

267.44 268.39 B: okay 

268.08 269.48 A: and ah 

270.09 283.20 A: they were saying you know that people nowadays are more considerate the smokers are more considerate you know it used to be you know our parents when they were kids they would take the smoke and blow it in your face and everything else 

283.31 285.33 A: you know as to now where 

285.54 286.65 A: um 

287.55 292.94 A: you know that people are more considerate about smoking you know i know i am 

291.94 295.72 B: (( i i guess i can see that too to to an extent yeah )) 

294.88 297.64 A: you know i i know i am um 

298.56 302.55 A: i um and i've always been that way you know i try if

316.90 319.44 A: but yeah it's 

319.81 323.60 A: it's a tough situation as to what you know 

324.44 329.13 A: what is gonna happen with everything you know um 

327.99 328.87 B: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

329.31 335.65 A: like we went to the zoo which was outdoor area and um 

335.72 339.32 A: you can't smoke there and it's like why 

339.73 343.65 A: you know it's outdoors but 

342.29 345.33 B: that that just doesn't make sense rules like that 

344.08 346.79 A: [noise] no it uh-uh 

345.56 347.58 B: i think um [mn] 

349.08 352.52 A: yeah it it's tough to decide what you know is 

353.03 360.31 A: good for you or isn't you know and yet like you said you have to make a happy medium with the um public 

360.61 364.17 A: you know i know when they start putting in these smoking bans 

364.66 365.89 A: the um 

367.17 369.17 A: restaurants are complaining 

369.52 377.35 A: because and the bars you know they're saying well we're gonna lose you know our percent- our money and if they're gonna do that then they need to 

377.82 381.45 A: you know all that money that um people have gotten 

381.89 387.32 A: or all the states have gotten for smoking they need to compensate the owner 

387.47 389.99 A: you know or do so- do something because they're 

387.57 388.67 B: (( [noise] )) 

389.77 392.76 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

390.00 396.71 A: you know i've heard that they take the money and you know send it someplace else and d- don't even pu- ah spend it on 

393.78 395.25 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

396.73 399.21 A: you know what it's truly meant for 

399.27 411.88 B: [cough] [cough] well you you'd think that well you know with with as much financial concern they have in it that y- the smoking com- ah the tobacco companies would have put a little more effort into trying to keep bills like that from passing 

399.65 400.56 A: you know 

411.75 412.92 A: right 

412.13 426.88 B: like everywhere everywhere you see ah anti smoking ads but the tobacco companies you know there's ah still a lot of smokers and it wouldn't be so hard to get them to rally together and vote against something like that but it seemed like nobody even bothered trying 

423.72 425.08 A: yeah right 

426.99 430.68 A: [noise] yeah and you know why they're doing it 

430.83 433.35 A: you know it's tough to say 

433.81 438.87 A: why the smoking companies are not you know doing more for people 

439.42 440.87 A: um you know 

439.79 440.47 B: i 

441.22 456.22 B: i imagine that it they're just trying to lay low with all the advertising that they have to you know legally buy now that says smoking's a bad thing and a dangerous thing and i wonder if they're just trying to stay out of the limelight whenever possible 

450.95 452.33 A: (( right right it's still probably )) 

456.18 464.63 B: (( even if that includes losing a battle like that yeah )) 

460.17 461.85 A: ((  )) 

463.90 472.11 A: financially yeah and it could be you know ah it's it's tough to say what's gonna happen with 'em you know because it's um 

472.47 479.81 A: [noise] really hard you know well but you also look at it r. j. reynolds you know 

479.82 480.91 A: run a big 

480.94 481.82 A: ah 

481.83 483.17 A: company 

483.23 486.74 A: they also have food and everything else you know 

486.12 487.86 B: yeah 

486.93 487.93 A: um 

488.48 498.55 A: you know is that you know no matter what we do people are gonna buy cigarettes anyway and smoke 'em so we're not worried about 'em you know or is it um 

498.88 503.04 A: you know they don't they don't want to spend the money but 

503.33 508.17 A: i mean it's tough to wonder what is going through their sys- you know their 

508.34 509.63 A: minds 

510.52 514.51 A: as to why they're not fighting on it 

513.90 515.36 B: (( it's ah )) 

515.81 516.79 A: but 

515.96 517.13 B: tricky 

516.88 519.67 A: now do you harp everybody about smoking 

519.70 524.27 B: no i don't bug anybody i ah i smoked for a while and ah 

524.24 528.16 B: i just i quit like three months ago i got a really bad sinus infection 

527.91 528.84 A: uh-huh 

528.14 534.07 B: and ah the just the idea of smoking i was so congested and just thinking about cigarettes i couldn't 

533.97 548.97 B: and it you know how you get like mental stigmas and things i still now have that thought like when i think there are times when i know like i want it i wa- i crave the nicotine but to to think about physically putting a cigarette to my mouth and smoking it it just makes my 

536.97 538.05 A: right 

547.61 548.85 A: (( right [noise] )) 

549.04 558.50 B: lungs and and sinuses and everything just kind of shrivel up and feel all gross so i mean i can totally be around people that are smoking like i said i'm a d. j. so i'm 

558.88 571.32 B: in smokey clubs all night and it does doesn't bother me like i don't nee- it it that the smoke itself doesn't bug me it's just the idea of smoking now i did just i gave myself a stigma from being so sick 

571.00 572.06 A: right 

571.43 572.48 B: (( but ah )) 

573.48 576.15 A: mhm well it's good though 'cause you know

582.93 584.32 B: (( yeah i mean it's )) 

585.29 591.44 B: i don't know it it is a bad habit but it is something that's enjoyable and you know if it's something you wanna do 

592.00 593.11 A: you'll do it 

592.05 592.80 B: (( i'd ))
