0.54 2.95 B: hi i'm kim from florida 

2.77 5.15 A: (( hi i'm greg from san francisco )) 

6.22 7.38 B: (( uh )) 

8.02 12.74 B: and we're just i this is my first call we're just supposed to start talking about the topic 

12.96 15.53 A: i guess this is my first call too [laughter] so 

14.58 16.09 B: (( okay [laughter] )) 

15.85 19.43 A: i don't know it's supposed to do with corporate scandals in america 

19.35 21.62 B: yes i guess on how it's affecting 

21.86 26.07 B: our lives and whether it's causing the recession and uh 

26.49 27.50 B: um 

28.80 30.91 B: i don't think it's had that much effect 

31.19 33.76 B: on my life like directly 

33.84 35.54 B: um right now we 

35.66 43.07 B: [cough] we have some money in 401ks but um we don't have a lot in stocks right now um 

43.35 45.08 B: what about you 

45.52 50.04 A: uh pretty much the same thing i i don't think it really affects me directly but 

50.49 53.59 A: i i'm one of those people that kind of indirectly thinks that 

53.66 56.67 A: this government is responsible for all this anyway [laughter] 

56.70 60.30 B: no i i i agree with that too i think that um 

60.62 61.70 B: i i 

62.04 68.59 B: i wouldn't say i'm a democrat but i'm definitely um i think that the bush administration is so 

68.63 76.14 B: pro-business that um i mean if this hadn't happened i think they would have loosened the reins even more and we could've 

76.21 78.79 B: really ended up with a much bigger problem 

78.42 81.85 A: (( oh definitely yeah i'd have to say that too [laughter] but )) 

81.49 82.34 B: [laughter] 

82.55 84.55 A: (( i i think that uh )) 

85.55 90.57 A: i think the problem is that if our government is being run by these corporate guys 

91.36 99.46 A: and their money is what's funding these politicians and in turn they get laws that make corporate rules like accounting and things like that more lax 

99.90 101.48 A: and they get away with more things 

101.86 107.32 A: and when they do an investigation it's not really an investigation it's more oh what what else can i get away with 

107.87 122.26 B: oh exactly i i agree exactly my whole thing is has always been that unless there is complete public financing of campaigns this none of this will ever end because i mean th- they're beholden to 

122.11 125.87 B: special interests in who pays for their campaigns and um 

125.96 131.61 B: i mean it's just inevitable if you want to stay in a politician you have to take their money 

131.65 132.79 A: oh totally 

134.41 136.26 B: so um 

136.36 141.76 B: i i that's always been one of my pet peeves a- although you know they always 

141.61 143.69 B: couch it in terms of 

143.53 155.47 B: you're anti free speech if you are for you know government funding of campaigns there's no reason they can't last like maybe a month or two and not these thirty second you know attack as in sound but 

155.28 159.78 B: have to you know take an hour and really explain their policies and 

159.81 162.35 B: not take any money from special interests 

162.15 166.56 A: oh definitely and i don't really think there is you know that many anyways a lot of them are 

166.77 169.04 A: are pretty well all businessmen or 

169.28 173.12 A: as in the president's case he basically was handed his fortune by his dad so 

172.99 173.95 B: mhm 

174.00 176.57 A: i i don't i don't really see how 

176.70 179.98 A: corporate financing really helps them anyway it just makes them richer for 

180.40 181.41 B: yeah i 

181.27 184.44 A: whatever reason that's you know [laughter] 

184.92 196.26 B: yeah i almost feel like special interests picked bush b- you know what i mean rather than the other bush decided to run and and then he went and got the money i think the money came to him 

196.42 197.66 A: (( oh definitely [laughter] hm )) 

196.44 197.25 B: (( [mn] )) 

197.30 200.21 B: because they knew what he um 

201.15 206.17 B: you know that he would support i i just think he's just i'm not even sure 

206.91 213.42 B: how i mean i think i he feels things strongly but i'm not sure how bright he is as far as you know 

214.63 218.84 B: [sigh] i don't know that you know i mean how deep i guess i would say but 

221.10 222.02 B: um 

221.74 225.53 A: i'm just curious how how does this call thing supposed to work do you now 

225.26 229.21 B: i'm not sure i think i think they're just studying like the way 

229.33 232.32 B: we speak i think it's like a linguistic 

232.13 233.13 A: oh i 

232.53 246.89 B: um exercise so i mean i think they just pick a topic for us to talk about and then study our speech patterns and i don't i that's the gist that i got out of it um and i don't know how i do you know how long it's supposed to last 

246.55 252.49 A: see that's what i'm not sure about it either i'm not sure if they're supposed to end it like all of a sudden or 

252.32 254.40 B: yeah yeah i'm not sure either 

252.92 255.40 A: (( press a button on the phone or something or )) 

255.37 256.32 B: are you 

255.41 257.10 A: (( how long to go for )) 

256.84 257.78 B: um 

257.90 259.69 B: are you from san francisco 

259.75 264.91 A: (( born and raised in san francisco yes but i'm not there right now per se but i am )) 

261.00 261.93 B: okay 

264.19 275.49 B: oh okay i'm i'm from ohio but i live in florida now i'm i'm i'm from up by cleveland and so i don't know if i'm sure there's a lot of dialects and a lot of times you can tell i mean i've 

275.45 279.66 B: spoken on the phone before and um someone must 

279.78 292.22 B: have detected an accent because i remember them saying go back to ohio [laughter] they were mad at me and it was i think i w- when i was volunteering for a tenant's um union where you help tenants out and [laughter] 

284.41 285.36 A: (( really i )) 

291.81 294.44 A: didn't know people from ohio had accents 

293.98 296.46 B: i didn't think i did either but uh 

295.48 304.91 A: i've never noticed one i think the only times i've noticed an accent is if someone's either from boston new york or somewhere in the south like tennessee or georgia or something 

297.12 298.20 B: yeah 

304.18 306.07 B: yes yes 

305.16 307.04 A: but other than that i don't really 

307.72 309.76 A: (( like hear any accents from anywhere else in the )) 

309.16 318.05 B: i know i d- i don't know if my ears just not attuned or um but i didn't think i had an accent until he said that and i'm like wow that's really strange 

318.00 322.65 A: country but then again maybe people on the east coast think that everyone else has an accent so 

318.12 318.99 B: (( um )) 

322.05 331.01 B: yeah yeah that could be i can't remember yeah i don't know where he was from i don't remember detecting that big a accent with him um [lipsmack] 

332.69 333.91 B: but uh 

332.90 334.52 A: (( that's interesting [laughter] )) 

334.36 338.20 B: how many so we'll we'll do like two to four of these calls or 

338.49 341.70 A: i think they said the maximum you get is like 

342.13 343.60 A: (( uh was it ten calls i think )) 

343.32 344.30 B: (( oh okay )) 

344.33 345.68 A: (( or something like that )) 

345.29 346.20 B: yeah 

346.11 348.60 A: th- that's fine with me [laughter] 

347.92 352.04 B: okay yeah i know i- i- it's kind of interesting um 

352.36 354.08 A: (( and they pay us for it so )) 

352.49 358.06 B: but are you would you consider yourself a democrat or independent or 

358.26 359.18 A: i'd 

359.95 361.74 A: (( i'd say independent more in )) 

362.16 364.69 A: favor of democrats than republican for sure 

364.71 370.78 B: yeah i consider myself independent more but like i would say socially i'm more um [lipsmack] 

371.13 373.12 B: liberal in [mn] um 

373.28 383.04 B: i don't know i g- i and i used to be much more liberal i'm forty one and and as i age i think i get a little more conservative but on like core issues i don't but i i guess on 

383.11 389.19 B: um i don't know welfare and things like that i my views are evolving a little bit 

389.31 394.54 B: or are like i mean some people might say the opposite that they're regressing but i consider 

394.69 396.76 B: them evolving like i'm 

395.96 400.09 A: oh i think as as we get older it starts to apply more 

399.89 401.39 B: yes that's true 

400.72 403.82 A: so it affects you more so yeah of course i can see how that 

403.87 407.58 A: would come into play but i'm only twenty five so 

407.16 408.18 B: okay 

407.99 412.35 A: yeah so i i probably don't see it the same way you do at this point but eventually i probably will [laughter] 

411.86 423.99 B: yeah well i always found like um but i think it's the same because i think there's you know probably ten times more corporate welfare than there is like regular you know welfare i guess i i've just found in 

413.02 415.45 A: (( especially if things don't improve uh-huh )) 

424.06 429.83 B: me personally is that like i used to always help people out financially and and i 

430.24 444.94 B: that seemed like down on their luck and i would either never get paid back and and i think i've finally come to the point where i realise that you don't help people by doing that you know what i mean you're just like prolonging a problem and it took me a while and i almost think the same 

439.23 439.91 A: (( right )) 

444.85 449.82 B: with welfare that you ha- you can you know try to teach them or um 

450.33 456.60 B: but when you just keep throwing money at something i- i- you're just prolonging it 

455.96 460.61 A: (( oh definitely but i i agree i think corporate welfare is more substantial than )) 

457.00 457.97 B: so 

460.78 462.33 A: it is for individuals 

462.97 475.73 A: just because i mean you can even look at the bankruptcy thing companies getting bailed out by the government just because they they screwed up if it was you or i that screwed up ah too bad you know and it's like yeah you file for bankruptcy and you're screwed for years 

467.87 469.23 B: oh yeah 

475.46 476.49 B: mhm 

476.93 480.99 B: yeah and with them it's nothing in fact we bought our house um 

481.57 486.48 B: [lipsmack] through the i don't you might be too young to remember it was r._t._c. when the savings and loan 

486.39 487.32 B: uh 

487.20 496.12 B: i think it ended up being like half a trillion dollars which at the time was a lot of money and it was bailing out the savings and loan which is the same thing they took 

495.93 507.19 B: they took off the um regulatory you know they deregulated and um didn't have a lot of oversight and and one of the bush's sons was one of the um 

507.86 512.48 B: [lipsmack] he h- a bank he was involved with went under too but anyway 

512.75 524.06 B: they had they like made so many poor loans that they were like there was so much real estate all over the country that they had to get rid of and so we ended up getting a house through that and 

523.84 524.84 A: oh wow 

524.60 531.67 B: yeah w- i- for a very good price um but yeah because they the government had to bail 'em out just take over everything 

532.40 533.64 A: (( geez right mm )) 

533.62 543.43 B: [mn] there are are probably hundreds of savings and loans that they had to do this to but in you know the the problem is like we got a house but most everything was um 

544.62 551.42 B: a lot of times like you know the big businesses would turn around and get this stuff probably you know configured in a different way 

551.84 558.64 B: you know it might have been one corporation that did this and then they turned around and you know made out because 

558.73 561.64 B: they got property for so cheap but 

562.56 563.44 B: (( yeah )) 

563.88 568.81 A: (( oh sorry to change the subject but i'm reading the email right now and it says you may participate in up to three calls )) 

568.94 571.58 A: so i guess they call you a few times and as 

571.71 574.69 A: soon as you've completed three calls then that's it 

574.71 579.17 B: okay now so do we go does it say how long you talk or 

579.32 581.29 A: (( no it doesn't it just says if )) 

581.41 585.92 A: you don't want to participate in the topic then you hang up and they'll call you back in forty eight hours 

586.22 587.09 A: but 

587.21 589.49 A: that's all it says in regards to hanging up 

589.28 591.39 B: (( [laughter] )) 

589.61 591.14 A: and ending calls 

591.32 593.09 A: (( it doesn't say anything else )) 

591.90 599.89 B: i can just see us talking for like half hour forty five minutes and not realising that you can hang up at any time i yeah i didn't
