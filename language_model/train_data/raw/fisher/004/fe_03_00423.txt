143.73 144.59 B: (( uh-huh ))

148.51 149.66 B: yes 

150.48 154.84 B: yeah i think family is very important to ah people so 

153.30 154.02 A: (( um mm )) 

155.13 160.57 B: looks like a big strong support i think especially that in chinese tradition 

160.31 161.25 A: (( mhm )) 

160.67 170.41 B: family is really important because each time you have some happy things you share with the family and each time you ha- when you mm 

165.34 166.25 A: (( mhm )) 

170.30 178.76 B: feel bad there is always somebody who will support you or something that feeling is really good [laughter] yeah 

171.71 172.46 A: uh-huh 

176.95 180.62 A: yeah ah and and and and 

179.54 183.69 B: but i'm not sure how 'bout um looks like american people um 

184.02 190.08 B: ah is not ah too much put too much its times on family issues right 

190.03 192.99 A: i think i think it i think it varies i mean 

192.71 195.03 B: is also very important 

194.92 203.04 A: it it to me it's very important but i also think that it has to do like both my paren- my parents have been married for over fifty years 

196.88 197.81 B: (( okay )) 

199.04 200.07 B: mhm 

202.21 204.04 B: oh okay yeah 

203.32 208.62 A: so i think that that has something to do with it because if you have strong 

206.67 207.67 B: mhm 

208.43 209.38 B: mhm 

208.68 209.91 A: parental 

209.93 210.97 B: (( ah yes )) 

210.05 216.51 A: you know guidance i think that family is strong and yet i think if you have 

216.27 217.35 B: mhm 

216.73 223.27 A: a mixed family where you have divorces i think that things can br- things can break down 

219.84 220.80 B: (( oh okay )) 

223.04 233.84 B: yeah because from a lot of ah like american movies [laughter] yeah sometimes you can say that children doesn't care about the family or something but 

234.21 236.51 B: when they were young or some 

234.26 235.23 A: (( mhm well [sigh] )) 

237.08 243.14 B: i think maybe after you h- have a family you will feel more strong stronger 

243.54 245.24 B: (( about family )) 

244.60 250.32 A: yeah i i think that a lot of it has to do with who is able to stay home i know that 

247.22 248.17 B: mhm 

250.85 254.59 A: you know grandparents who are with children 

252.53 253.50 B: mhm 

254.31 255.27 B: yes 

254.69 259.93 A: often as caretakers have a much more stronger relationship 

256.60 257.59 B: yes 

259.29 260.82 B: mhm yes 

260.03 262.25 A: than if um 

261.85 264.17 B: fam- ah the parents [laughter] mhm 

263.67 271.02 A: ah if the parents work all the time their their time in in building that relationship with their children is is interrupted 

270.64 271.70 B: yes 

271.06 279.62 A: so if if you're able to stay home with your children in their formative years you're able you're able to increase that bond 

273.78 274.74 B: mhm 

275.74 276.80 B: yes 

278.89 281.43 B: yeah i think that's very important

286.55 288.65 B: person to you or something 

288.68 290.52 B: not ah so important 

290.61 293.48 B: yeah i think back in china i think ah
