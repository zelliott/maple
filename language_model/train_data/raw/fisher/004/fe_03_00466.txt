299.84 300.81 B: yeah 

301.16 310.78 A: well i was in a forum and then someone told like someone just like po- po- posted a message about this and it was just kind of it was kind of different you know 

307.89 308.96 B: (( oh i )) 

310.62 311.60 B: yeah 

311.13 320.41 A: and so i was just like going to try it out and see if like what like what this really is about i mean like if this is from a university of pennsylvania so i don't think it's a 

320.79 326.94 A: it it it would've it it would actually just be pretty much real or something so i just wanted to try it out 

321.03 321.87 B: yeah 

326.34 329.53 B: yeah that's nice um yeah so 

330.13 332.08 A: so you're going to grad school 

330.54 343.14 B: yeah i haven't had yeah i i do i did make a few friends um but uh it gets harder as you get older i mean you know your base of friends what you started with when you're younger 

338.53 339.81 A: (( [laughter] )) 

343.09 348.27 B: it's it's easier to make friends when you're younger i think once you grow up and you get kind of 

343.30 344.29 A: uh-huh 

346.09 347.49 A: yeah it is actu- 

348.26 360.05 B: you know you get your niche you carve your niche and you have things you like and things you dislike it's m- a lot more open ended so people you meet are yeah yeah 

354.17 355.14 A: uh-huh 

356.41 357.57 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

358.95 363.13 A: and i kind of notice that like when you're in [mn] like when we're in college and like 

363.27 367.30 A: and you as you grow older or something people tend to t- like keep to themse- [mn] 

367.53 372.68 A: their own like previous friends than to yeah real hard 

369.34 374.18 B: circle of friends yeah it i think there is such a thing as overloading 

374.78 375.68 A: excuse me 

375.12 382.56 B: having too many friends i think there is such a thing as overloading where you're just so um caught up in you know just doing 

382.58 384.31 B: you just don't have enough time 

382.80 383.85 A: [laughter] 

384.42 387.22 B: you just can't extend [laughter] beyond what you have 

384.68 386.07 A: yeah 

387.55 399.83 A: yeah and then you start and then you start slowing down and then you start like i don't know it's it's it's actually kind of weird but you know actu- actually i don't think i have [mn] that many friends but [laughter] it's 

399.94 406.44 A: it's pretty it's still overloading especially 'cause like because of work now it's a little hard to um 

406.68 410.67 A: keep tr- like keep in touch with a lot of my old old friends too 

410.89 414.34 B: oh have they moved away or just time wise 

411.43 412.85 A: (( sometimes i should )) 

414.68 424.89 A: time wise 'cause yeah it's it's 'cause as like we grow older or something we we just like have to divert our attention from schoolwork to work and then like 

425.25 434.69 A: because of work it's a lot like less time with like less social time it's more just time making money or something so it's a little diff- it's uh very different actually 

433.27 446.16 B: yeah and i- it's not just the the eight hours a day that work takes but you come home in the evening and a lot of times i just end up sitting home [laughter] i'm just too exhausted to m- do much so the entire 

439.50 440.38 A: [laughter] 

442.59 443.61 A: yeah 

445.07 446.34 A: yeah actually 

446.25 447.27 B: yeah 

447.64 449.14 A: yeah i feel that way 

447.87 449.12 B: (( what were you going to say )) 

449.13 450.08 B: yeah 

449.63 452.22 A: oh no that's about it [laughter] 

451.28 452.28 B: yeah 

452.53 456.51 A: so uh so what else is there to talk about friends [mn] 

456.57 458.26 B: (( um let's see )) 

458.27 459.67 B: (( i don't know i )) 

460.21 461.07 B: (( just )) 

461.36 468.27 B: um so where so do you hope to make more friends at this point or do you have to find more time 

468.50 483.43 A: uh i don't know i think i'm pretty happy with like the group of friends that i have you know i mean like um it's not like i'm really extremely bored every day or like a loner or anything i mean i live with a couple of my friends so you know that's not really that too bad 

469.11 470.05 B: to make friends 

482.92 485.24 B: oh house mates that's a lot of 

484.73 485.85 A: [laughter] 

486.12 495.10 A: yeah so it's not too it's not that ba- like bad right i mean like i feel pretty happy with my the amount of friends i have or something so 

495.30 501.85 A: may- maybe later on or some like maybe later on like to get a change or something but not really like 

502.10 504.79 A: uh top priority for me 

504.46 507.24 B: yeah you're happy in your paddock 

505.58 507.07 A: what about you 

507.83 514.00 B: uh i'm pretty happy too i mean a- as i said i moved out here not too long ago so i've kind of been 

508.04 509.00 A: excuse me 

514.33 516.30 B: uh building um you know 

516.48 523.38 B: building my own circle and i i'm you meet [mn] um yeah i'm beginning to feel pretty happy 

516.92 518.17 A: oh yeah huh 

523.53 525.36 B: with that yeah 

523.69 524.90 A: oh that's cool 

524.92 526.54 A: that's that's cool 

525.53 536.48 B: i have people that i do s- you know specific things with so [laughter] people i go out to hike with people i go out to just sit in the coffee shops and um 

530.48 531.48 A: [laughter] 

536.71 538.90 B: [lipsmack] i don't think i've actually 

537.57 539.06 A: that's like a routine 

539.21 548.98 B: yeah but actually b- it would be quite it would be nicer i i kind of miss my older like high school friends too 'cause those people 

540.63 541.78 A: (( kinda do )) 

547.37 549.25 A: you still keep in touch with them 

549.35 557.85 B: uh i do but um you know they c- come out to see me once in a while but it's it's not the same once you move away i think you kind of 

558.11 559.14 B: yeah 

558.54 561.18 A: yeah like [mn] 'cause i mean it's 

559.82 564.14 B: even if you try to keep in touch through email and such it's just not the same 

564.27 575.85 A: just not yeah yeah especially 'cause if you used to spend you know like all your days with them and then like suddenly you move away and then you do you only see them like five times a year it's a little dif- [laughter] it's just um 

564.83 565.43 B: (( so )) 

576.03 578.41 A: it's so much harder to talk to them 

576.31 581.40 B: yeah and and there's just so much you can catch up with over the phone and email so 

581.23 583.70 A: uh-huh yeah 

581.70 587.51 B: it's just you you do end up kind of moving on and building your own you know building a new circle 

587.72 588.52 B: uh 

587.79 589.77 A: yeah it just 

588.54 599.95 B: but i do kind of miss just calling one person or you know calling having uh one s- specific set of people that i just call and you know that person will call somebody else and just we'll just go out to do all sorts
