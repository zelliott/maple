228.50 229.59 B: grasp at some later time 

229.84 230.57 A: yeah 

231.11 235.68 A: yeah if you if you warn him there are going to be people out there with with uh different 

236.03 238.36 A: kinds of opinions and they are not all wrong 

238.87 240.63 A: uh and he can 

241.06 243.19 A: make good choices for himself 

243.94 244.81 A: and um

262.39 264.82 A: actually before he was one he was walking 

265.34 267.18 A: and he would walk around the house 

267.82 270.68 A: and he would see little bits of dirt on the floor 

271.68 273.25 A: and he would go uh oh

290.08 291.23 A: you know and and 

292.30 295.74 A: walk around everybody's house with a broom and a dust pan 

296.46 297.57 B: usually that's not

317.60 321.25 A: a main door or a room door or something he will say 

321.58 322.71 A: shut door

379.30 382.33 B: every month gets a different person pretty much or unless we go and visit one of them 

382.52 384.74 A: oh that's really cool but you are close enough 

385.13 386.24 A: geographically 

385.25 385.77 B: no

388.14 389.22 B: they're they are flying 

389.38 390.85 B: a couple thousand miles from 

391.06 392.42 B: for two of the three of them 

392.72 393.21 A: yeah 

393.02 394.84 B: in order to come see us we haven't been able to put 

394.07 394.84 A: wow 

395.52 397.31 B: our four year old on an aircraft yet 

397.42 397.91 A: yeah 

398.32 399.45 B: we tried taking him 

400.02 400.53 B: on a 

401.57 404.26 B: two hundred mile (( )) to a big city and staying overnight in a hotel 

404.27 404.78 A: mhm 

404.85 405.75 B: a couple of years ago 

407.54 408.09 B: so that (( )) 

408.23 409.47 B: couldn't sleep in that little bed so 

409.71 410.89 B: he and i didn't sleep that night 

411.04 411.62 A: oh 

411.34 413.07 B: and we came home the next day instead of staying 

413.18 414.17 A: oh 

414.36 416.03 A: oh so he's not 

415.41 416.78 B: and now he's decided 

417.03 417.87 B: hotels are great 

418.32 418.93 A: mhm 

418.82 421.03 B: hotel showers are a fine thing too 

421.13 422.18 B: i don't like the shower 

425.01 426.08 A: oh man 

425.51 428.30 B: and so i was taking this residual bath at night 

427.92 428.54 A: mhm 

428.55 429.78 B: he gets instead to 

430.50 432.92 B: do something different and so he likes going out to 

433.62 435.76 B: places where he can stay in a hotel amusement parks are even better 

436.35 440.69 B: you go you play all day everyone pays attention to you and then at the end of the day you get 

440.88 441.92 B: to stay in a different bed and 

441.94 442.30 A: yeah 

442.38 442.89 B: stay up late 

443.36 443.75 A: oh 

443.60 444.31 B: so 

444.15 445.59 A: stay up late i was thinking 

445.68 448.32 A: af- after spending time in an amusement park he would be 

448.62 449.35 A: conked 

449.61 450.32 B: uh 

450.71 451.76 B: no not to be exact 

452.01 453.62 A: oh 

453.10 455.26 B: you have a much more imagery than i do being a 

455.45 456.12 B: being a child 

457.19 458.39 A: uh 

457.63 458.83 B: so he thinks that you know 

459.12 460.43 B: being carried to places 

460.93 462.51 B: being allowed to sit down a lot 

462.93 464.56 B: that just keeps him going through the day 

464.41 464.88 A: yeah 

465.38 466.20 B: so he gets to see it 

466.77 468.09 B: we usually we will go with 

468.27 470.68 B: one of the grandparents when we do this and so 

469.96 470.36 A: uh-huh 

470.92 472.09 B: if we stay at that pace 

472.53 475.15 B: the grandparents and his parents get worn out and he is 

475.30 476.32 B: just raring to go 

476.56 477.12 A: wow 

477.12 477.88 B: wants to go back 

478.35 479.20 B: just enjoys 

480.85 482.45 B: the time that he gets to spend with people 

482.65 483.25 A: yeah 

483.01 486.35 B: he uh his big thing is quality time he constantly says to me 

487.01 489.38 B: when will you be off of work so i can play with you 

489.11 490.56 A: aw 

490.70 492.18 B: yeah that's heartbreaking thanks 

491.93 493.54 A: ah
