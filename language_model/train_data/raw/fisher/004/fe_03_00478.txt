424.98 427.43 A: oh it doesn't have to snow okay that's good 

436.90 438.25 A: so this is this isn't 

438.43 441.81 A: that is interesting just sitting around trying to talk about a cold for a 

441.93 444.27 A: how how long do we talk about this for 

443.44 446.80 B: i don't know this is my first one 

444.38 445.04 A: ten minutes 

446.56 448.91 A: oh okay it's mine too and i'm like 

449.31 450.35 A: okay this is interes- 

449.88 451.09 B: okay 

451.20 460.96 B: whatever 

460.50 461.32 A: wow what's that 

461.73 467.36 B: that is uh push me popper 

468.17 471.16 A: oh oh i remember those with the um 

471.27 474.27 A: and you roll it and it's got the little clear bubble on top 

474.25 474.84 B: right 

474.98 475.68 B: and it pops 

475.17 475.98 A: oh okay 

476.15 478.20 B: one of the loudest toys ever made 

478.69 479.73 A: they are classic 

480.07 480.87 A: and kids love them 

481.00 483.41 B: oh yeah this one thinks it's a vacuum cleaner 

484.36 488.28 B: so he goes back and forth and back and forth i suppose like he's vacuuming 

490.14 493.90 A: and they usually you uh lose interest by the time they could really be vacuuming 

494.01 494.30 A: so 

498.38 500.21 B: well i don't do you do we hang up 

501.62 502.44 A: uh i 

502.56 508.28 A: think that i i'm sure that it's on or something when the the time is up i believe or let me see 

507.52 509.90 B: is there a timer uh this is my very first one ever 

510.41 512.81 A: well it's mine too let me see how long it's been on 

515.39 515.69 A: huh 

515.89 521.69 A: well i have ten minutes and thirty eight seconds on the phone but it took them a while to connect me so 

522.39 523.55 B: i did let me see how much i (( )) 

526.06 527.26 B: nine minutes and it did take 

529.19 529.92 A: oh okay 

532.93 533.52 A: unless 

533.61 536.29 A: i don't know my timer is kind of funky i'd gotten a call 

536.68 537.32 A: and then i'd 

537.71 541.08 A: clicked over and there was the call so i think yours is more accurate than mine 

543.03 543.79 A: (( )) 

544.42 549.88 A: (( )) for sixty more seconds i guess and hopefully they'll break in like thank you you've talked for ten minutes 

557.69 561.99 A: it's an interesting survey though i was like find out about like the kind of
