2.84 4.78 A: hi i'm debbie how you doing 

4.69 5.26 B: fine 

9.40 12.73 A: um i guess we're suppose to talk about this topic 

11.38 12.42 B: oh we're suppose to yes 

12.62 17.30 B: okay our topic is um illness and whether a cold last seven days if you do anything about it 

17.47 18.35 B: seven days if you 

18.77 19.55 B: don't 

19.66 22.92 B: and um whether we get ill more frequently when 

24.03 25.81 A: right yes yes 

28.89 37.31 B: absolutely right i don't think too much of anything changes the duration of a cold but you can change how badly it makes you feel 

37.33 39.60 A: i'd agree with that yeah definitely 

40.82 41.10 B: (( )) 

42.39 42.92 B: (( bring )) hot 

52.88 55.86 A: i agree with that definitely yes yes 

59.93 62.14 A: um well 

62.98 66.14 A: i guess when it gets colder people head inside and 

67.20 74.41 A: i guess a lot of the times it's the the summer ch- turning into the fall and then the kids are together and that's when everything starts uh incubating again 

73.66 74.47 B: yeah people 

74.71 78.54 B: i c- you're right people spread germs more frequently i have um 

78.83 83.01 B: i'm allergic to a lot of different things so when the seasons change especially spring 

84.10 84.69 B: i get 

84.95 88.07 B: you know such horrible allergy attacks it's like being sick 

88.73 91.13 A: oh i'm sure yeah yeah well especially in the 

91.41 96.44 A: well i i always notice it in the fall you turn the heating system on and there goes all the dust coming out 

103.80 109.51 B: you know but you'd think that the cold would actually make it better because you would think it would kill some infections and germs and pollen 

110.98 113.29 A: no not enough of them anyway 

112.97 113.67 B: i know 

114.54 115.22 A: uh

258.20 260.54 B: more infections and illnesses and 

263.78 265.18 A: mhm 

278.03 280.94 A: they need to come up with some more interesting topics for us 

280.80 281.14 B: (( )) 

281.26 282.85 B: illness is kind of interesting 

284.57 286.00 B: i guess not if you're 

286.65 288.49 B: not sick a lot there 

288.09 290.03 A: well that's true that's true 

289.52 291.52 B: if you're basically pretty healthy and 

292.12 294.12 B: you know your family is pretty healthy and 

294.30 297.70 B: you know as i said i'm allergic to a lot of different things but you you know 

300.22 301.36 A: mhm 

300.99 301.60 B: and it's not 

301.77 304.83 B: you know the same as being ill or catching an illness we haven't had a 

308.30 309.49 B: well not even the little one um 

310.03 310.33 B: (( the )) 

310.58 312.07 B: five year old went back to school 

312.37 313.44 B: w- his first year 

313.95 314.65 B: and has still has 

316.48 317.85 A: that's not bad 

318.10 318.39 B: no 

324.24 325.05 A: okay 

327.83 328.36 B: few stomach 

332.25 333.41 A: mhm 

339.95 340.52 A: yep 

340.29 341.30 B: that kind of germy thing 

341.47 342.53 A: mhm 

343.60 345.46 B: yeah i think that that's where a lot of illness 

348.82 350.25 B: people that work in 

356.06 357.36 A: oh yeah 

356.90 357.23 B: uh 

357.42 357.69 B: (( )) 

360.87 362.66 A: i would think so yeah 

367.73 368.10 B: you know 

368.19 371.18 B: where people are sneezing in the store while they're shopping then they're handing you 

371.38 372.25 B: their money or their 

372.26 373.39 A: um hm uh 

381.62 382.21 B: i don't know 

383.92 386.04 B: and then i work in telecommunication 

390.55 392.00 B: you know people use each other's phone 

392.50 394.60 A: oh okay that would do it 

398.67 399.95 A: mhm 

399.70 401.00 B: but a round of illness 

405.35 406.69 A: yeah that's a good idea 

410.18 411.23 B: phone p- you know the 

411.74 414.34 B: ear pieces on the phone wiped off and the the desk 

417.39 418.08 B: that helps some 

420.33 427.58 A: yeah i know some of the the school teachers started handing out those wipes here they had so many kids out they j- the kids would clean their desks with them 

427.84 430.22 B: oh yeah well you have to because they they live 

430.33 431.50 B: i don't know i think that 

431.65 434.87 B: a cold virus and a cold germ doesn't live for very long 

436.74 438.82 A: okay probably not 

436.97 438.09 B: i think when they're on a eh 

438.43 439.98 B: when they're on an exposed surface 

444.32 444.91 B: you know almos- 

445.31 447.06 B: touch somebody right after they had 

448.77 450.00 A: um hm uh

466.20 467.26 B: the on-line studies 

467.49 468.88 A: right right 

467.85 469.81 B: and they are so interesting 

470.37 471.24 A: um hm uh 

472.94 475.21 B: (( )) it's all just very interesting but this 

477.51 477.83 B: study 

479.16 481.79 B: you know and i think that i'm sure they realize that uh 

484.74 485.09 B: (( )) 

486.40 487.75 B: not going to be quite real sure and 

488.31 489.95 B: they may start doing more um 

492.66 493.25 B: detailed 

494.24 496.22 B: scenarios for us to go through 

496.03 497.25 A: mhm 

501.58 503.15 A: i think so 

507.18 512.84 A: no just the same well that i i like the hot tea and the hot soup that that's the usual one i use

530.51 532.05 A: right right

547.60 548.02 B: strangers 

549.40 550.85 A: that would be my guess 

553.46 556.23 B: you know or what people do to fill a silence on the phone 

556.17 557.24 A: mhm 

571.83 574.09 B: got to be interesting i think you can get the results of
