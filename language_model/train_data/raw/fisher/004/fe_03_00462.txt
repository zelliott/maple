115.38 115.83 A: yeah 

117.60 121.78 A: see i wonder though if you can have more then one best friend 

123.60 131.93 B: i don't know i think their could be controversy and jealousy between people because i know that's how it gets

139.34 139.89 B: right 

140.07 142.75 B: right i think you always have one that you just 

140.45 141.87 A: because i don't talk to him 

143.32 144.49 B: confide everything in 

144.64 145.14 A: yeah 

146.25 147.55 A: well it was awesome 

150.73 151.23 A: right 

153.43 154.93 B: almost like jealousy sometimes 

155.25 156.28 A: i know 

155.83 157.79 B: because she is a single girl and 

157.90 163.49 B: they're able to do more stuff then i can do so i think it's a little bit i just think you have one one friend that you just 

159.89 160.44 A: right 

163.11 163.36 A: that's 

163.49 164.16 A: true

166.51 168.55 B: other then that i mean 

168.72 169.85 B: can only you know i just 

170.04 177.47 B: trust is a hard thing you know friends you have to be able to trust your friends and your friends have to be there for you and vice versa 

171.59 172.03 A: yeah

191.23 192.13 B: growing up maybe 

192.14 192.62 A: yeah 

192.75 196.03 B: because i had a best friend all through school like kindergarten through high school

198.98 200.54 A: college and everything 

199.88 204.83 B: yeah weren't in the same you know town anymore so you kind of lose touch

204.93 205.74 A: exactly 

205.35 207.46 B: yeah we still talk but not like 

207.65 210.32 B: high school high school is different though i think so

213.22 216.07 B: yeah yeah mhm 

215.95 218.64 A: you know what i i'm still busy now but it's different 

219.33 219.85 B: well yeah 

220.39 227.83 B: because you're an adult now you can do what you want on your own level high school is plan plan planned so 

224.16 224.79 A: yeah 

225.47 225.93 A: yeah 

227.65 228.50 A: exactly 

228.23 228.82 B: mhm

236.25 236.90 B: mhm 

236.95 240.93 A: well we have um you know this other person we worked with and i just you know like 

241.35 243.88 A: it's so true how that say three is a crowd 

244.11 244.74 B: yeah 

244.45 247.63 A: and although we were all friends it just got kind of weird 

252.31 254.43 B: like i just i'm not i don't 

253.47 255.62 A: here i i got very jealous 

255.31 255.68 B: i don't 

255.79 259.08 B: see because i don't like her and i don't see what she sees in her i guess 

258.23 258.96 A: right 

259.50 267.13 A: well see even even if you are friends you still get jealous because this person who um randy and i are both friends with 

259.57 260.45 B: you know it's like 

267.29 267.71 B: mhm 

268.04 270.81 A: you know although like i was friends with him too 

270.99 271.42 B: mhm 

271.51 271.91 A: i just

281.13 281.69 A: right 

281.76 283.33 B: and i can't you know and 

283.18 284.07 A: that makes sense 

284.22 286.02 B: you know i feel like left out a lot 

285.85 291.13 A: i do i get jealous too i get really jealous i have a definite jealous issue 

288.16 288.63 B: mhm 

292.14 294.34 B: yeah 

292.17 295.08 A: but i feel bad you know i don't tell her anything because 

295.89 297.80 A: i i don't see any reason because 

297.90 299.56 A: that i should be jealous you know 

297.93 298.36 B: mhm 

299.70 300.32 B: yeah 

300.69 304.88 B: well i don't know i mean i know you need your friends but 

305.29 310.28 B: i'm at that point in my life where i don't need a million because i have my family you know 

308.52 312.63 A: i know i don't you know i don't think you ever have a million do you know what i mean 

311.54 311.99 B: yeah 

312.81 315.17 B: but like in high school you want to be popular 

312.97 313.48 A: you just 

314.40 318.21 A: well i have like i have a lot a lot a lot of friends but 

318.62 320.64 A: i can't keep in touch with all of them 

320.29 320.98 B: mhm 

321.22 322.98 B: who's got time i know i don't 

322.74 325.90 A: not no not at all even with the internet know and days 

325.79 326.39 B: mhm 

326.18 330.41 A: you still i mean you hop online there are a bazillion people you still can't even talk to all of them 

330.00 333.60 B: mm i know that is how i stay in touch with a lot of people though 

333.27 334.80 A: yeah well it helps a lot 

334.01 335.75 B: sending a hello or 

335.26 336.79 A: it's so much easier 

336.62 337.20 B: mhm 

337.11 338.17 A: but it's still i mean like 

338.51 341.83 A: you know i have a lot of friends that i met in different points of my life that i would 

341.93 343.66 A: like to talk to 

343.77 350.90 B: right because every body is in a different point in there life you know 

344.28 345.01 A: but i don't 

345.48 346.41 A: get the chance 

348.17 348.53 A: yeah 

350.00 351.87 A: in a different state 

351.96 353.14 B: that that's true 

352.99 355.23 A: that always makes it a little more difficult 

355.24 357.47 B: i think i'm more better friends with family 

357.63 358.13 B: then 

358.62 359.72 B: you know cousins and 

359.50 360.32 A: really 

360.19 360.77 B: yeah

360.95 363.39 B: you know but a lot of them out of state so 

361.62 363.41 A: my family is crazy 

364.08 372.60 A: i think it depends on you family like i'm definitely close with my very immediate family but as it extends to cousins they also live far away 

368.90 369.28 B: right 

373.15 375.39 B: yeah see i have a few cousins we all grew up together so

448.22 448.69 B: mhm 

448.69 449.44 A: is the thing 

449.99 454.42 A: i don't like her at all like i guess she's kind of nice but find her to be sort of an air head 

450.81 452.23 B: and it's hard 

455.54 455.99 A: and 

456.26 457.60 A: um i i really 

457.74 463.15 A: don't like her but randy likes to hang out with her and i mean i don't i wouldn't mind hanging out with her

468.30 471.64 A: i don't want to go any where i just just didn't want to go it was freezing 

469.49 469.93 B: mhm 

471.81 477.95 B: and that's how like my girl friend kelly her friend dorothy the one i don't like she likes to go downtown and i'm an hour from downtown 

477.78 479.22 A: right oh my gosh 

478.62 481.13 B: you know i (( )) chicago and go downtown well 

480.74 481.22 A: right

484.30 487.91 A: yeah you know let's go next store to the bagel place you know 

487.20 495.25 B: and be safe i mean i don't need to be driving downtown you know and i just and i'm not looking for a guy and i think that's because they're single 

490.37 490.93 A: yeah 

493.86 495.68 A: yeah well they went out to a club 

495.43 496.54 B: uh-huh and that's what they did

507.00 507.30 A: and i 

507.66 509.86 A: i think it would be a lot different in the summer though 

509.92 510.36 B: mhm 

510.34 511.97 A: which is funny do you know what i mean 

512.48 513.58 A: i wouldn't mind so much 

512.51 514.73 B: i think more people want to do stuff in the summer 

514.47 518.14 A: well that's terrible i mean no matter you know you park right next store anyway you 

518.49 519.51 A: you can't 

520.10 524.49 A: it's just too cold you don't want to get out of your car you don't want to walk in you don't you know what i mean 

524.38 524.89 B: mhm 

525.08 527.20 A: it's just a hassle makes everything harder
