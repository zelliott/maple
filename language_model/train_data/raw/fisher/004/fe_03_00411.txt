0.92 1.87 A: hello 

1.35 2.71 B: yes hi

8.57 9.98 B: (( oh delilah )) 

10.19 12.16 A: (( all right )) 

11.46 14.52 B: so i guess we're supposed to talk about education and computers huh 

14.62 21.54 A: yeah i guess they help anyhow i i would think it helps [noise] in every in every aspect of it 

18.81 19.73 B: well i 

21.25 22.87 B: oh yeah such as 

22.17 22.90 A: [noise] 

23.30 30.59 A: [noise] well i mean [noise] like i'm i'm a computer science major in university and every day i use a computer 

27.87 28.88 B: oh okay 

30.65 31.77 B: mhm 

31.45 32.67 A: and like 

32.78 42.39 A: [noise] without computers [noise] i i mean like even like with students with the emails and things like that they can email teachers and quickly speak to teachers and ask questions and they get the feedback really quick [noise] 

37.11 38.04 B: mhm 

42.57 51.30 A: and if not the teacher the the teaching assistant can help them [noise] and they get more help that way which is a lot faster than any like traditional [noise] [noise] 

52.00 53.93 B: yeah i can't hear you very well 

54.62 55.96 A: oh sorry 

55.73 56.97 B: okay [laughter] 

56.19 58.47 A: [noise] that that a little better hold on let me [noise] [noise] 

57.43 59.38 B: yeah yeah that's yeah that's better 

59.36 60.24 A: okay 

59.92 70.89 B: you were fading in and out there for a second y- yeah that's all right no i i agree that you know that computers can help i think they neither um harm nor really i think they just facilitate really 

61.89 63.50 A: oh okay i'm sorry [noise] 

70.29 73.72 A: [noise] [noise] right [noise] right 'cause like [noise] what [noise] 

71.65 72.79 B: (( and like things )) 

73.58 80.73 B: they make things easier you know they can't replace a certain type of instruction you know like in a college setting 

75.34 76.43 A: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

80.74 81.95 A: right 

80.97 87.27 B: um but they can you know um add to it supplement it you know in a efficient way 

85.37 86.68 A: (( [noise] [noise] well )) 

87.15 91.53 A: [noise] right i think also li- li- at at a young age when the kids use computers 

91.58 98.15 A: [noise] for like school wise it ends up teaching them a lot more than like like like now at this age i only learn- 

93.16 94.01 B: mhm 

98.02 104.99 A: i only started using computers when i was like probably [noise] in high school [noise] kids like my little niece and nephews they use computers [noise] like 

104.83 117.10 A: in elementary it's like that so they know the ins and the outs of computers and [noise] they're a lot more they're like a lot more used to it so like they they they benefit a lot more from it ah learning at a early age the computers [noise] 

116.54 121.82 B: right yeah i see the same things my niece and nephews i think they were born with a mouse in their hands you know [laughter] 

121.12 122.67 A: you're right 

122.15 131.10 B: when i when they when i first bought an ibook at home they looked at it then they go auntie you don't have a mouse [laughter] 'cause you know it's a track pad you know 

128.49 130.10 A: [laughter] 

130.48 131.82 A: right 

131.11 139.33 B: and they're like where's your mouse i'm like i don't need one [laughter] yeah but don't you think they're less curious about other things like books for instance 

134.83 136.13 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

139.10 140.06 A: (( [noise] uh )) 

142.27 143.28 A: (( [noise] hello )) 

143.11 149.80 B: yes i was saying don't you think that they're less curious of other things like books they tend to read less 

143.93 144.81 A: yeah 

148.23 150.12 A: right yeah [noise] 

150.44 156.65 A: i think i think it goes both both ways it could be like some kids read a lot more but then 

150.49 151.69 B: 'cause they expect 

156.62 167.42 A: like kids some kids the kids who are used to computers they might not read as well read as much but they might get more information off the web such as news and stuff like that which they wouldn't get ah 

163.62 164.53 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

167.59 170.16 A: living at home by themselves doing nothing [noise] 

169.81 177.66 B: right do they really know how to get information though or are are they just to just you know getting stuff by clicking on a mouse isn't that kind of 

177.00 184.51 A: yeah a- again that goes back to i guess how they're taught to use a computer what they use it for yeah i mean that's true 

177.67 178.87 B: (( too easy )) 

181.42 182.64 B: mhm 

184.50 193.90 B: it's too easy [laughter] [laughter] and you know there are more and more students cheating also because they find so much information available online 

185.77 187.52 A: [noise] yeah it is 

188.28 189.52 A: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

193.89 195.08 A: that is true 

194.80 199.33 B: you can actually you know buy papers for all kinds of classes and so on 

198.62 200.48 A: (( [noise] oh right so in that sense i guess )) 

201.36 204.40 A: it would harm education [noise] it does harm yeah i guess it he- harms that way but [noise] 

204.45 213.23 A: i think in the long run it's got to be it's got to be a lot more beneficial than harmful [noise] but yeah there's always the pros and cons of each side [noise] each [noise] 

212.50 213.64 B: mhm 

213.96 217.71 B: what about ah what do you think of ah digital divide 

218.00 220.02 A: which kind what kind of devices 

219.81 228.75 B: no the digital digital divide you know the fact that if you have access to a computer you have access of a lot more things than if you don't have access to a computer 

226.72 227.67 A: oh right 

228.79 231.21 A: right the kids i mean i'm sure the kids who 

231.30 238.51 A: who lack in computer i mean lack the access to computers like for a while when um [noise] at my house [noise] 

238.46 245.33 A: we didn't a com- the internet was messed up and that that time alone maybe it was three or four days 

245.29 256.61 A: the kids like all the kids in the house were it's really like hurting that they couldn't get to the websites they needed and like a lot of the homework and the stuff that we need are on the websites now 

256.33 257.40 B: mhm 

256.54 264.49 A: instead of delivered 'cause i i i mean i'm from the university university of texas at austin and it's a really big university with classes like two or three hundred people 

260.71 261.76 B: mhm 

264.52 278.25 A: so they don't always like pass out papers or anything like that they tell us to go to websites and say hey we're gonna save some money on like paper and you know whatever but it's easier to tell the students go to websites and the second you don't have that access 

278.40 281.08 A: lose a lot a lot lot of time ah potential 

281.32 283.15 A: time to do homework [noise] [noise] 

282.76 289.42 B: actually at big universities like ah u._t. don't you have don't all incoming freshmen have to have a computer 

289.36 290.71 A: [noise] no they don't 

290.40 293.28 B: oh okay i thought so well i guess i was mistaken 

291.32 294.13 A: yeah they don't don't have that going on right now 

294.33 299.03 A: [noise] i think some of the honors programs have that but the general students don't 

294.45 295.40 B: oh okay 

299.05 302.34 B: hm oh okay i guess i was wrong that's interesting 

301.42 303.05 A: yeah 

303.32 307.61 A: yeah i think that might be at something like at most universities higher level 

303.41 304.43 B: yeah 

308.26 312.52 A: universities they just make every student incoming freshman buy a computer 

312.23 313.85 B: mhm 

313.34 316.56 A: so i mean i think some some our engineering ah 

316.97 318.01 A: school 

318.10 328.81 A: makes sure the kids get ah what's it um they buy laptops even like the graduate school here the graduate school they all have laptops when they come around they had to buy 'em [noise] 

324.14 325.04 B: mhm 

328.68 329.57 B: right 

330.41 331.19 A: (( so )) 

332.47 335.62 B: yeah so more money for more education [laughter] 

335.20 343.54 A: right it's i mean education's getting a lot more expensive it seemed like steady climb when i first got to university i think my 

335.70 336.63 B: [laughter] 

343.90 350.28 A: monthly my semester fees were like eighteen hundred for like twelve to thirt- fourteen hours now it's like 

350.33 352.64 A: twenty one twenty two hundred 

352.65 353.85 B: oh yeah 

352.68 353.31 A: (( [noise] )) 

353.50 355.91 A: yeah it's a lot more now [noise] 

355.37 359.15 B: wow that's kind of of unfair to people who can't afford it though huh 

359.27 369.22 A: yeah it's true 'cause i mean like but also i mean i don't think there's no one who can't go to university 'cause the uni- our government pays like will give you loans to 

369.61 380.28 A: enough for you to live ah live like [noise] enough for your books tuition and some living costs they always give loans if not grants or anything they'll always give loans to everybody 

380.39 389.60 B: right but you know the the loans i mean financially is it conditional you know upon a bunch of factors n- not everybody can get financial aid and then 

380.83 381.58 A: so 

389.49 404.07 B: it put also more pressure on you once you graduate to actually get a job you know within six months so i'm you know don't you think maybe some people are more reluctant to go to college because they don't want to be you know in debt by the time they graduate 

393.48 394.94 A: oh yeah of course 

404.31 407.21 A: yeah i i'm sure some people find it 

407.38 420.55 A: like a hill to climb to get the money and then having like once you gain the money how are you gonna pay it back and just a whole opt- if you don't have the option of getting some somewhere then finding the money is hard [noise] 

420.09 421.14 B: mhm 

420.81 428.18 A: and i'm sure it deters people from school but that's something like at any time you gotta risk something before you gain something 

428.14 428.98 B: right 

428.24 431.26 A: so i mean risking some mon- like the chances of 

431.29 435.55 A: having to pay something back and they get an education out of it or you can earn money higher 

435.87 441.69 A: higher paid i think that all [noise] most people that who who are willing to take a chance will 

441.81 442.88 A: go for it 

442.70 444.27 B: yeah i guess so 

444.36 445.29 A: so 

444.44 458.53 B: i guess so well you know the other thing i was thinking about the use of computers in education is that it makes since you know you interact less and less with people and more and more through you know the computer it makes education less ah 

458.56 463.33 B: you know individual less personalized isn't that ah a negative effect 

463.45 468.89 A: [noise] [noise] yeah i mean i i i as of right now where i'm at at university you see less 

469.00 472.34 A: student teacher interaction so that alone [noise] 

472.26 482.91 A: hurts i mean introduction of computers like the websites that of course we don't get the ah [noise] the i mean it's a lot different [noise] when teacher tells you in your face [noise] 

482.70 491.72 A: and she'll helps you do it while ot- now where it's set the slides and stuff like that are all on the website you don't get the whole the effect of 

491.79 496.66 A: yeah i'm sure you get a lot more from you know teacher itself one on one interaction [noise] 

494.60 495.71 B: right i mean 

495.98 499.09 B: yeah i mean you might as well stay home and just study online 

498.84 504.45 A: [noise] yeah you i mean you lo- i mean you can probably get through the class but you don't get as much out of it [noise] so [noise] 

504.20 505.59 B: mhm 

504.60 506.14 A: (( [noise] )) 

506.45 507.48 B: yeah 

507.81 510.49 B: it's interesting because see you're a student right 

510.40 511.59 A: (( [noise] right )) 

510.91 515.80 B: yeah i'm a professor [laughter] [laughter] and 

514.56 517.35 A: mm [noise] you're the other aspects [noise] [noise] 

516.38 524.78 B: yeah exactly [laughter] and and i can see you know in large class- i don't like large classes but the largest i teach have fifty students in them 

524.41 525.45 A: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

524.79 529.59 B: but the largest you know the class the more stude- the more i use the computer 

526.33 527.31 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

529.61 544.10 B: you know i have a website and a discussion forum online and i encourage students you know to get a hold of me through email and at first you know a lot more things online they can access class notes and papers and all kinds of stuff 

529.69 530.89 A: (( right [noise] [noise] )) 

533.52 535.05 A: (( ah [noise] exactly )) 

544.05 557.73 B: but i feel i get to know the students a lot less and the rapport between me and the student is not as good as in you know smaller classes where i've got less than thirty students and i get to know the names you know within a couple of weeks 

544.05 544.86 A: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

550.62 551.72 A: [noise] that's true 

557.80 558.91 A: yeah 

558.15 564.33 B: and and i feel like i care about them you know and they're not just a social security number on a piece of paper 

564.29 566.59 A: right i understand 'cause like 

566.36 567.21 B: yeah 

566.54 576.63 A: when i when i first got here at the university like i took all the classes that were like the freshman core classes [noise] and there was like two three hundred people in each class but now that i'm taking my 

572.36 573.25 B: mhm 

576.53 583.36 A: i've been doing c._s. classes [noise] there's not more than like maybe twenty or thirty [noise] and sometimes say twelve [noise] 

580.75 581.63 B: right 

583.12 584.28 B: mhm 

583.90 595.57 A: and of course there's a m- there's a like these teachers maybe they know your name they know everything how you progressed through the class [noise] and so you get you get a better understanding a better feel of the class al- also 

595.42 596.22 B: right 

595.58 599.95 A: you're not left out in the open in just out in the open you're just kind of like hanging out w- 

599.44 599.95 B: mhm
