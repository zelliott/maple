6.99 9.72 B: [laughter] i live in a cold climate here so 

8.96 10.99 A: uh us too we're in illinois 

10.70 13.88 B: yeah and i'm in a area of pennsylvania so 

13.08 14.59 A: there you go [laughter]

22.77 35.29 A: yes yes i have three kids in school so we go through the strep throat and the colds and the stomach flus we've had like three stomach flus already since school started in late august 

35.22 43.52 B: oh my word yeah i've been lucky this year um i got the flu shot and i haven't got the flu but i'm just going through uh almost a 

44.18 49.08 B: uh sinus infection type thing for about the last year and 

47.89 51.22 A: [laughter] gotcha yep those are absolutely horrible 

51.19 64.70 B: and it's like you know i've you know go to the doctor but just like they says it's like you know i gets even if we get a little bit of an antibiotic it just might clear up for a week or two and it's really back so i don't gain too much 

62.52 63.37 A: right 

64.22 73.79 A: yeah because if you don't clear out your nose then it's just gonna keep happening no matter how many antibiotics you have 'cause it'll keep stuffing up and getting clogged you know 

73.55 80.60 B: yeah yeah i heard where they say you almost have to be on something a good month or more it might take to really push it out and then 

79.98 80.79 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

80.87 92.63 A: i've um a girlfriend's husband had a very very terrible sinus infection and was on antibiotics for about six weeks before he was finally able to go out and right when he was done [noise] he got another sinus infection 

92.34 93.65 B: (( oh my word )) 

93.30 97.31 A: but he didn't have it for two months while he was on the antibiotics 

97.22 102.53 B: yeah yeah and you just can't you know stay on something like that so basically i just try to

102.59 116.90 B: i go uh you know try to [sigh] get out in the weather my husband and i you know we'll go out maybe ski once a week and but i have to i get those little foamy earplugs in the one ear that always seems it's like um [laughter] i remember my little earplug and of course m- in our g- 

111.17 111.94 A: yeah 

112.37 113.59 A: yeah

121.89 123.12 A: (( yeah [noise] ))

127.34 128.74 A: exactly 

128.93 132.73 A: i always wear a hat now [noise] i i never used to when i was younger at all

135.85 138.82 B: [laughter] yeah and like i say i 

138.89 149.37 B: anymore of a [sigh] i mean used to anymore like any of the o- over the counter and the medicines and things they just i don't know they seem to bother me more than if i don't i don't know like i'll 

149.22 156.35 B: i'll get something to dry it up and then that gets you a headache and you get something the other way so i've kind of i just don't really 

152.28 153.22 A: yeah 

156.22 158.26 A: there's really yeah there's nothing 

157.11 168.75 B: use anything like that anymore like i'll heat something them things in the microwave that are like a heat oh like it has little pellets in it or oatmeal and kind of and like lean on that or 

164.29 164.87 A: (( [noise] )) 

166.57 167.84 A: [mn] yeah [noise] 

170.73 183.83 A: yeah that those are i i'm actually [noise] on an allergy medication for nasal allergies i have them all year round depending it's just called vitaray it helps but there are still a few times when i'm really sick that it doesn't work [laughter] 

176.48 178.12 B: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

183.25 186.22 B: yeah well about once a year i do get a

191.70 192.55 A: okay 

192.33 195.73 B: and then in between i don't know if you've ever heard it like nasal calm 

195.47 198.80 A: yes but mhm mhm the nasal spray yeah 

195.76 197.36 B: you spray it in your 

197.88 202.09 B: yeah and that really surprisingly if i keep on that 

201.61 202.46 A: huh 

202.19 208.81 B: and it's more natural it's not like it doesn't have anything like you're taking them things that make you a little sleepy you know mhm 

206.37 207.59 A: right it 

208.17 214.69 A: yes exactly and it doesn't exactly get rid of all it [noise] it's still a little bit there so 

213.33 215.45 B: right but yeah 

214.83 216.66 A: (( sarah's home dad's home too )) 

217.20 228.23 B: but like i say you said with your children with the streps and i mean as a child i i just continuously had that type of thing streps and oh i know what you know you're dealing with there 

224.51 226.42 A: yeah it's not fun 

227.80 233.61 A: it's uh my daughter is seven almost and i'm we both have type one diabetes 

233.35 234.51 B: oh 

234.00 237.37 A: so we have our immune system's a little bit suppressed 

236.37 237.91 B: mhm 

237.45 244.54 A: and i get i this year thank goodness i have not gotten strep once not yet last year i had it like six 

244.64 245.74 B: wow 

244.96 249.23 A: times so so far so good [laughter] 

246.90 248.46 B: [laughter] yeah i guess 

249.22 260.06 B: i think that k- it's kinda like if you get something real bad for so many years in a row and you get a little reprieve i think they say you build up and then maybe a year or two two like i like with my allergy that's 

249.34 250.20 A: (( oh )) 

254.16 255.09 A: mhm 

259.39 260.61 A: mhm 

260.02 270.63 B: i know i've had years where i'd just be horrible and then all of a sudden you'll get a year it's kind of you build up a little immune and then then of course then it [laughter] a year later it starts all over again 

264.40 265.67 A: not that bad 

265.99 266.97 A: mhm 

268.18 269.04 A: yeah 

270.33 280.94 A: i i i've been very i switched from we use paper towels everywhere when we wash our hands and we just throw them out i just and i'm very careful about washing my hands 

275.65 276.58 B: uh-huh 

280.92 291.71 B: well that's that's another thing i i've i mean i've not that when i go anymore like to a public restrooms i get the i come out i get the paper towel first [laughter] i turn the 

286.72 288.12 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

291.74 300.06 B: w- you know after i wash my hands i shut spickets off with it [laughter] i open the door and then i i reach in and give it a toss where hopefully it will land in a can you know i 

292.71 294.33 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

294.81 296.82 A: with the door yeah 

297.43 305.41 A: mhm yeah [laughter] that is so funny it you it's just disgusting i can't 

300.79 302.38 B: [laughter] 

304.27 305.20 B: but they 

305.44 320.33 A: i can't even think of you know we always come home from the store we wash our hands and it's like you can it's not just it's not just um germs i mean you can especially the grocery store i don't know if it's picking up all the stuff off the shelf and putting it in your cart but your hands are dirty mhm 

320.01 332.97 B: well they say i mean actually you can get more from touching stuff like that or shaking hands i've heard more so than if you actually like sneeze on somebody per se you know 

332.18 334.02 A: oh really 

333.10 335.58 B: just more by shaking hands 

335.38 336.55 A: okay 

336.09 340.86 B: 'cause i used to [mn] and at the church where we're going you know they'd have that little shake hands that they 

340.48 341.49 A: mhm 

340.88 346.45 B: in a certain part of it and i started getting like oh dear i was carrying this little sanitizer [laughter] 

345.41 346.32 A: yeah 

346.46 358.60 B: you know afterwards and then my husband laughed oh they- they'll probably you know smell that [laughter] but then i read that's just kinda we use that stuff too much they say can be bad it makes your immune systems not like 

357.88 361.13 A: [laughter] right it doesn't make it keep it strong i understand yes 

359.84 366.20 B: they say that children today are catching more things because we have you know the all the antibacterial soap 

365.35 368.75 A: mhm yeah the soap and stuff they don't really cause us mhm 

366.67 370.13 B: and the sponges and it says really that makes it that you 

370.28 373.38 B: don't get strong you're better if you 

371.78 375.95 A: right you don't build up an immunity to it yep i've heard that too we 

373.53 374.87 B: (( mhm uh-huh )) 

376.00 387.27 A: we are i used to do the same especially when they were babies but now that they're older we just wash our hands and try not you know i have a three year old so she keeps she still puts her hand in her mouth and all that 

387.32 396.58 A: but she's she's getting better the other two fortunately are they don't touch their face that's my biggest i don't even don't touch your face [laughter] 

396.92 399.07 B: but like i say basically the 

399.18 409.05 B: getting through the cold season i mean i used to have things on hand like your oh your hot cold medicine and this thing and that but it's kind of i've i've [mn] in the last year 

405.02 405.87 A: yeah 

409.18 410.35 B: i've kinda 

410.37 411.25 A: right 

410.88 418.04 B: laid off of it a little unless it's absolutely you know necessary or you'd get a prescription and you need it because 

412.39 413.52 A: mhm 

413.92 415.54 A: yeah necessary 

418.85 425.20 B: so much of it didn't really i it just made it made me made you feel a little better [laughter] made you sleepy and 

423.22 431.53 A: yeah right it didn't really [mn] yeah and i felt i always anything anything over the counter gave me made me either irritable or 

431.58 439.42 A: made me tired so it wasn't worth it i didn't take i stopped taking almost you know i don't take anything over the counter really it doesn't work [laughter] 

437.51 438.46 B: uh-huh 

438.96 441.66 B: and what do you kind of then do just kinda the 

441.42 449.15 A: the my prescription allergy medicine works and other than that if i'm really sick i kinda tough it out because i can't really 

449.32 454.05 A: since i take it on a daily basis i can't really take any other antihistamine 

452.34 453.34 B: yeah 

453.67 454.73 B: (( mhm )) 

454.07 455.98 A: so and it's like 

455.03 456.97 B: and what are you taking like uh 

456.71 457.99 A: it's clarynox 

457.96 470.74 B: claryn- oh okay i've heard of that yeah for in between when i'd get the allergy shot and he'd say if you get a real bad day i'd have some of the old uh allegra which is a similar on the same idea they don't make you uh mhm 

458.82 459.64 A: yeah 

463.89 464.75 A: yeah 

466.87 467.68 A: yeah 

468.04 468.90 A: yeah 

470.30 476.42 A: yes but see i was on allegra and i i suffered from one of the main side effects which was back pain 

476.54 487.18 A: i've never had i've had three kids even huge pregnant i never really had back problems and i'm just i kept going along and going along and i'm like man my back is killing me my back is killing me 

476.66 477.57 B: oh 

487.17 495.46 A: and then i talked to the doctor and he said well it could cause back pain and it must've been that because i stopped taking it and my back pain went away i mean 

493.25 493.98 B: (( mm )) 

494.61 497.74 B: well that's strange yeah some of the side effects 

495.92 498.56 A: right it's not for everybody but 

498.28 499.22 B: uh-huh 

498.69 500.09 A: for me [laughter] 

499.64 504.02 B: yeah well see i never was on it steady enough it was like 

503.91 504.75 A: yeah 

504.15 510.07 B: i i would just get a day maybe i'd be out in an area like go at a fair where there'd be lots of pollen or 

509.84 510.92 A: yeah 

509.92 515.95 B: or like we ride motorcycle where i'd where we'd be in some place where it's dust and real i'd get a real bad uh 

515.80 527.26 B: attack of it even with the allergy shot wouldn't help and i would just take it for that one day you know what i mean i didn't stay on it like as a day in and day out thing so i probably didn't experience that side effect 

516.74 517.54 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

519.82 521.40 A: (( mhm right )) 

521.94 522.86 A: yeah

553.19 557.85 A: mhm yeah yeah that's the sinus pressure it kills me mhm 

555.76 563.23 B: mhm and a ra- a rare time i'll try like something that don't have a either just a plain old

567.23 569.32 A: yeah mhm mhm 

568.42 579.47 B: but like the stuff like well sudafed and some of that you know i've gotta the one time the doctor says i was like on borderline for blood pressure so don't so three fou- three out of four of those things 

579.73 586.82 B: i guess they say like sudafed and some of them things he named he says just you know it wouldn't be you know good to 

586.30 589.82 A: yeah because yeah because of your it might actually increase your bl- mhm mhm 

589.20 590.17 B: right
