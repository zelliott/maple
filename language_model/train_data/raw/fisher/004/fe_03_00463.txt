402.51 406.07 A: the stress off of me to have to you know entertain them 

406.29 407.68 B: uh sure sure that 

407.52 412.17 A: because the other children entertain them and so i just keep an eye on them and watch them and 

412.87 418.05 A: and then the other kids just uh just play and they have a good time and give me a little break 

418.01 419.72 B: (( )) great that's great

444.90 445.23 A: that's 

445.42 450.43 A: that's true and i think that what we do is um we're a christian family 

450.39 451.14 B: all right 

451.28 457.17 A: and so we try to make our house an outreach to their children and sometimes we have to put limits 

455.12 455.77 B: oh great 

457.29 461.26 A: and we put we do put limits on the children uh or boundaries 

457.34 457.76 B: uh-huh 

461.42 461.94 B: uh-huh 

461.83 468.22 A: and you know as far as language goes and as far as um things like that and they know that when they come here 

464.00 464.42 B: yeah 

468.27 469.02 B: uh-huh that 

468.99 470.32 A: that can't do that

474.54 475.26 B: all right gre- 

485.87 486.40 B: great 

486.22 487.45 A: and they don't have to worry about 

487.53 489.42 A: then anything happening to them 

489.12 489.65 B: right 

489.55 500.19 A: um anything bad happening to them and so um you know we limit it when if the children are children that wouldn't uh wouldn't be a good influence on them you know we limit that and we watch that 

500.28 509.98 A: and if it's something that is is causing our children to act bad or or do things bad then then you know then we'll cut it off but we haven't had to to run into that you know 

503.23 503.70 B: uh-huh 

510.23 514.55 A: i want my children to be able to be involved with other children and know how to be involved with 

514.67 517.78 A: children that are different than them that are you know difficult 

518.01 526.90 A: but if it's if it's a children that's going to um be the wrong kind of influence them over time then then you know we'll cut that off but but we're we're always watching for that so 

521.96 522.40 B: right 

527.05 527.55 B: sure 

527.99 529.04 B: how about i mean
