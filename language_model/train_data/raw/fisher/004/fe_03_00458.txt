234.87 235.84 B: (( )) the 

235.96 240.88 B: because the sea is mild here they don't do it as much in california because the sea is too rough

409.75 412.04 B: dark already at four thirty five

417.29 417.71 A: mhm 

418.20 421.70 B: i mean they're short days so we can't really run down to the beach whenever we want 

422.09 422.57 A: mhm 

422.80 423.93 B: without some planning 

424.26 428.21 B: (( )) regretting it (( )) because it's supposed to cool off 

429.00 432.71 B: but otherwise i was planning to escape today i was planning to rollerblade and 

429.10 429.49 A: yeah 

433.37 435.87 A: right e- i mean is it along santa monica 

436.47 437.47 B: y- exactly 

438.04 438.97 A: right alright that's 

438.48 443.02 B: santa monica venice i think you can rollerblade (( )) on the way 

443.46 444.01 B: (( )) 

444.84 449.69 B: (( )) sure how that's done because there is an airport in between 

450.05 451.14 B: could do it 

451.99 455.06 B: but there's a long long long way that you can bike or 

455.27 455.66 B: blade 

455.81 458.63 B: (( )) i'll be adventurous enough to try it 

459.09 466.02 A: right you know i i actually (( )) and i (( )) but i (( )) complete it because ah 

466.22 474.30 A: [laugh] um i mean because of the parking because in l._a. the parking is the parking people are so strict and stringent 

474.46 474.76 A: [laugh] 

479.25 479.69 A: yeah 

481.37 482.80 B: (( )) 

482.95 483.49 B: (( )) 

484.17 485.16 B: (( )) 

485.93 487.96 B: ah beverly hills is i don't know 

488.95 489.31 B: (( )) 

489.95 491.21 B: if you get close 

494.39 494.67 B: (( )) 

495.88 497.40 B: (( )) 

498.28 498.69 B: (( )) 

499.16 499.99 B: so ridiculous 

500.81 501.38 A: yeah 

500.84 507.49 B: so that's (( )) that's another part of it if you want to do outdoor activities here in california most people gravitate to the beach 

507.81 509.71 B: and then you have to think about where to park 

507.89 508.21 A: mhm 

510.85 511.88 A: right 

511.14 512.48 B: so not so easy 

528.22 537.53 B: well people i mean most people now go skiing and to the beach because right now we have weather and snow in our mountains that are only and hour and a half away 

537.79 538.07 A: mhm 

538.64 541.91 B: so a lot of people are going to big bear which is our mountain 

542.00 543.44 B: in our mountain ski area 

542.27 542.55 A: mhm 

543.86 545.96 B: and you can also go to the beach if you're lucky
