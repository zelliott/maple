29.14 31.58 A: so we have to talk about uh computers in s- 

29.39 29.64 B: e- 

31.87 33.16 A: education right 

33.87 38.17 B: at think that was their plan and then we we just go if it's good or bad 

38.43 41.26 B: well pranks i say they get what they got coming 

38.61 39.04 A: um 

41.73 42.64 B: you can tell 

42.83 43.42 A: alright 

43.92 44.36 A: um 

44.73 45.93 A: think it's probably a good thing 

46.59 48.08 A: good uh as long as there is uh 

48.26 49.12 A: certain precaution 

49.78 50.35 A: you know uh 

50.81 52.22 A: good multi media tools 

53.09 56.48 A: uh certain kinds of access to the internet that kind of thing is uh 

57.01 59.38 A: pretty good uh for assisting and education 

60.73 61.61 B: i don't know 

60.93 61.43 A: so i think 

61.77 62.53 A: you don't know 

62.60 66.55 B: i have a little boy he is uh fascinated with pornography 

67.13 71.19 B: and he is thirteen and he can't get on the internet without somebody 

71.64 72.75 B: or a filter 

73.27 74.40 B: or some sort 

74.62 77.13 A: right and that's why i said with certain limitations so 

77.23 79.93 B: yeah yeah lots of limitations 

78.14 78.42 A: you just 

80.40 84.61 A: but i mean you know set up in the right environment you can put those kinds of filters on and 

85.04 88.00 A: you can you know use c._d. roms that are 

88.18 90.31 A: specifically for educational purposes and 

90.83 93.46 A: accomplish what you want to accomplish in terms of education 

94.44 94.94 B: but doesn't 

94.47 97.51 A: but yeah there's a lot of uh interesting information out there 

97.94 98.44 A: a lot of 

99.12 99.84 A: weird stuff 

101.12 108.97 B: right and at the same time doesn't give a person a false sense of accomplishment just because they see something down on a computer 

109.56 112.37 B: doesn't it take away their ability to do it themselves 

113.85 116.38 B: they are spending so much time in front of the computer 

117.04 121.35 B: when do they go out and explore and learn for themselves in the real world 

123.28 123.67 A: mhm 

123.76 124.23 A: okay 

124.73 125.60 A: i can agree with that 

126.68 129.34 B: i don't know it it's a and you know and it's a good 

129.59 134.57 B: computers are a good advancement for mankind there's no doubt about it but where does it end 

136.69 137.07 A: well 

137.27 139.24 A: you know i guess it's like anything in life 

140.21 141.25 A: you have to take the uh 

141.81 143.80 A: the uh good and bad together and sort of 

144.53 146.05 A: try to get the best you can out of it 

147.18 151.36 B: i imagine there are mothers sitting around after the invention of fire 

147.24 147.68 A: but uh 

151.93 158.04 B: thinking well that fire is good -cause the meat tastes better but i can't get johnny to come in from the outdoors 

159.39 159.85 B: so 

160.11 162.32 B: maybe it's just a natural progression 

162.89 163.72 B: the interest 

163.84 166.05 B: and the abilities that brings kids 

167.79 169.19 B: that just the signs that 

170.07 176.24 B: that's the way that where we are going to go but i just don't see the big boxes being the computer in the next ten years 

177.13 178.00 A: so what do you think it is 

179.23 182.10 B: maybe a material that they wear 

182.67 186.25 B: maybe they have screens that are on the inside jackets of their 

186.39 186.88 B: coat 

188.84 190.32 B: and maybe they wear a wrist watch 

191.13 191.54 B: i just 

191.66 193.38 B: see it is as a more personal (( )) 

193.57 194.10 B: experience 

194.22 194.77 B: that really 

194.89 196.26 B: takes a whole person 

197.18 199.06 B: in to account rather than a 

199.43 200.35 B: and apply it 

202.03 205.92 A: yeah i i can understand that but each person has to get what they can out of that and 

206.40 208.80 A: the nice thing about the computer and and 

208.91 211.14 A: all the information that's out there is that 

211.52 213.86 A: it really can apply to so many different people so 

214.53 216.23 A: think once you give people enough 

216.51 216.94 A: tools 

217.62 220.70 A: to know how to use and how to explore and and find those things 

222.24 224.73 A: or maybe design programs in which they can get the best 

224.98 225.93 A: out of it then 

227.96 228.24 A: think 

228.40 231.70 A: i think it can be really useful i think it is really useful now i mean i 
232.27 233.21 A: i pretty much use 

233.40 235.64 A: i use the computer to do all of my graduate work 

236.14 237.94 A: and um i you know i was 

239.42 242.28 A: i was in a place where i didn't have access to really good libraries 

242.43 246.36 A: so i had to use the computer and i was able to find so many different kinds of resources that 

246.89 247.90 A: helped me finish school 

248.82 249.64 A: and uh 

250.57 255.82 A: you know so i mean uh for me it was just an invaluable tool it's something i probably wouldn't have been 

256.23 261.85 A: i wouldn't have b- been able to accomplish the same thing in the same setting without the the computer and without those options 

262.51 262.96 A: so 

263.29 264.12 A: i i think 

264.33 265.60 A: uh i think it is the 

265.83 267.17 A: the tool of the future it's just 

267.29 267.57 A: the 

268.02 269.17 A: the matter of how 

269.33 271.56 A: i guess how society t- chooses to use it 

272.35 274.28 A: and i think it should be implemented 

274.86 276.72 A: really on a much broader scale 

277.65 279.32 A: but with really good planning you know 

280.36 286.35 B: (( )) and i know but at the same time i say i know i was around when the hand held calculator was invented 

287.27 289.85 B: what a what a great accomplishment was ex- 

289.95 293.42 B: -spensive but if you a hundred or two hundred bucks you could get one 

294.02 296.43 B: but it wasn't allowed in the classroom 

297.38 299.62 B: all the way until i got finished with high 

299.73 300.16 B: school 

300.68 302.30 B: and the price of them fell 

303.24 305.63 B: from a couple of hundred to thirty or forty bucks 

306.06 309.02 B: they were still never allowed in the classroom 

309.48 310.24 B: do i think i 

309.49 310.28 A: isn't that a good 

310.49 311.49 A: isn't that a good thing 

310.58 310.93 B: i g- 

311.58 313.04 A: i mean you're the whole purp- 

312.39 314.94 B: yes that was an excellent thing 

314.66 316.26 A: right 

316.36 320.05 B: there's some problems that i don't know how to do to this day but having a 

319.28 322.59 A: but it it's a different situation i mean when you are talking about 

323.33 328.44 A: keeping a piece of technology out of really out of the hands of the youth so that they can 

328.63 329.86 A: learn the skills of 

330.63 337.13 A: of doing mathematics on that base level you know which everyone needs to do be able to do without the uh 

337.57 338.26 A: without the uh 

341.46 342.51 A: (( )) in terms of 

342.85 345.82 A: access to information is sort of like a really big library 

346.96 352.83 B: well i i agree but you can't it can never substitute for the knowledge found inside of a book 

353.33 354.44 A: sorry once again please 

354.77 355.25 B: well 

355.52 357.68 B: i've read like several pages 

357.79 361.67 B: on a computer and after about the fifth or sixth page i'm gone 

362.23 367.03 B: i'm bored with it and i'm looking for another link or another source of information 

367.49 374.03 B: but if i had a book in front of me i wouldn't expect to find it in the first four or five pages of browsing through a book 

375.01 378.55 B: i don't think there is a substitute for a good library 

380.66 381.08 A: so 

380.70 381.15 B: i b- 

381.21 385.02 A: i mean uh basically in that case you feel people need to learn research skills before 

385.53 386.63 A: being allowed to use it 

387.69 390.45 B: and i believe that although it's a good tool 

390.93 394.07 B: it should be used as an entertainment tool 

394.86 402.29 B: and not so much of the cultural education because it gives a person a false sense of accomplishment like they really did learn something 

403.12 405.69 B: where the learning isn't exactly just an (( )) 

406.38 408.03 B: you're reading about it but 

408.56 409.38 B: experiencing 

410.42 410.85 B: and um 

410.56 410.86 A: (( )) 

411.22 415.20 A: yeah i mean i i totally see your point i mean uh you do have to learn a certain level of (( basic )) 

415.32 415.64 A: skills 

416.66 417.20 B: yeah 

420.92 421.76 A: but um 

422.95 429.65 A: hm i i i honestly it l- this is my opinion that that it should be used in in the capacity of uh 

424.02 424.37 B: but 

430.81 437.85 A: of like a research tool and people should be given uh like a sort of a class on how really to use it as a research tool and not as an 

438.05 441.29 A: as solely entertainment tool like your your son uses it where 

441.59 445.35 A: he just jumps from page to page i mean there are organized 

446.28 446.66 A: you know 

465.60 466.46 A: of uh training 

467.42 469.59 B: well right i agree with that 

469.70 473.83 B: in china do you know how they teach their kids how to problem solve 

474.12 474.46 A: right 

475.01 477.42 B: they put the problem up there on the board 

478.18 480.54 B: so they can see what the problem is now they put the 

480.97 482.70 B: they put the answer up there 

482.72 483.13 A: mhm 

483.52 486.93 B: and then they work backwards to find out what the question was 

487.35 494.09 B: and i think that just robs everybody involved that the answer and the question are so immediately available 

494.56 496.23 B: there's no thought process 

496.87 497.55 B: there's not 

498.26 503.10 B: i mean i i can see what you're saying for older kids for high school or in 

503.78 504.89 B: college and 

504.15 511.52 A: true but why not but i i guess for me it's like it's not saying just you know freehandedly give them an open access to the internet it's 

512.61 514.97 A: put a computer throughout a child's life 

515.52 516.40 A: in front of them 

516.84 517.32 A: and 

518.31 518.57 A: use 

518.74 524.50 A: the the knowledge of how to use a computer for the purpose of research for the purpose of growing intellectually 

525.00 526.75 A: uh you know as a part of the curriculum 

527.14 527.63 A: and 

528.82 536.83 A: it doesn't you know it's it's nothing something that you just rely on and you don't gra- you know gain inductive reasoning or deductive reasoning from um 

536.98 539.52 A: you learn how to use it in conjunction and i think 

540.23 545.90 A: i think you are going to have you are going to need both skills anyways and especially our society is so reliant 

546.14 546.73 A: on 

547.06 552.64 A: on computers nowadays that i i think that having that uh that education from a very young age
