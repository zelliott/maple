69.70 70.98 B: sort of ah 

71.11 75.64 B: if not if not the government some outside uh board 

75.91 83.12 B: uh that they have to be responsible to you know and uh that they would have to report things and

90.57 97.07 B: putting into effect and uh how the check out the board members and so forth 

98.54 100.44 A: yeah right now looks like all i got it (( )) 

100.56 104.18 A: cause in sales and i mean it looks like they're having a really big old time 

102.67 103.20 B: mhm 

105.77 112.09 A: but uh like i said i don't get involved with stocks cause uh i'm a homemaker and my husband's retired so we don't have a lot of money to put in stocks 

112.19 112.59 A: but uh 

113.61 114.14 A: you know it's 

114.42 116.72 A: i just think it's sad that the way the companies do 

115.46 117.42 B: yeah i don't yes people uh 

117.53 128.72 B: you know they put their money in these companies and then they uh they're taking a risk where they think that believe that they're honest and their uh going to s- make money that they put in is going to be safe 

129.22 130.20 B: and uh 

130.52 132.16 B: and then all of a sudden you know 

130.64 131.15 A: mhm 

132.56 135.44 B: there they are i- it's like the old savings and loan 

135.59 136.00 B: uh 

136.43 138.81 B: uh situations that they had years ago 

139.62 151.00 B: and people just you know people who really can't afford it lose everything and you have all these big executives you know taking millions of dollars and living living like royalty 

140.71 141.27 A: yeah 

151.65 156.61 A: yeah i tell you what if i had the money i'd be kind of still kind of scared to put it into anything 

155.05 155.58 B: mhm 

157.41 162.69 A: actually safer in my my my husband in a safe or in a you know in our savings account 

161.37 161.74 B: yeah 

163.16 163.45 A: in th- 

163.30 164.87 B: i know you you don't get uh 

163.63 164.64 A: in a good old bank 

165.29 171.41 B: uh it's much interest or yo- money that can grow that fast but at least you you think you're 

171.68 175.94 B: you think it's safe anyway 

172.22 173.67 A: at least you know it's there 

177.12 183.91 A: oh yeah so like i said this uh we don't play the stocks cause uh he's retired and everything but uh 

181.83 182.29 B: uh huh 

184.31 188.35 A: i've uh i know uh a i have a relative that did and i they lost so- lost some money 

187.14 187.59 B: yeah 

188.22 190.54 B: yeah especially these days i think even you know 

190.04 190.51 A: (( )) 

190.65 191.14 B: um 

191.60 192.61 B: besides the uh 

193.03 198.18 B: the the corporate uh stuff that goes on i think it's just uh kind of a risky business now 

198.52 200.79 B: things are too unsettled and uncertain and 

200.26 200.70 A: mhm 

201.33 202.87 B: and everything you know that uh 

203.13 205.09 B: to even uh think about um 

205.71 207.50 B: putting money in in stocks 

207.61 211.08 B: unless you really have you have enough that you can afford to lose it 

209.46 210.38 A: yeah 

211.35 211.87 B: that's 

213.12 213.46 A: oh 

213.74 221.65 A: yeah i definitely don't like that he's retir- he was a state worker former state worker and retired so and the state never pays much 

217.70 218.25 B: uh huh 

220.50 225.43 B: yeah i can imagine i know i'm retired too and uh and of course i n- 

225.61 226.29 B: i've never 

226.63 227.06 B: um 

227.19 228.18 B: had any stock 

228.58 234.29 B: and uh but it's just uh always made me a little nervous 

235.20 238.79 A: yeah uh huh i like knowing having my money where i know where it's at 

237.09 237.88 B: right 

238.03 238.50 B: if you can 

239.63 242.51 A: the little that we have i like to keep it where you know 

240.55 241.84 B: that's for sure and 

242.09 245.34 B: somewhere where you can get to it easy and you don't have um 

245.81 247.73 B: uh a lot of people um 

248.17 248.86 B: i guess 

249.44 253.81 B: not that they handle it but that they're involved in the process of you know 

254.17 261.13 B: of of that so where your money is uh you just put it in and it sits there 

260.57 261.64 A: yeah uh huh 

262.00 264.54 A: oh shoo- 

264.17 268.91 B: uh do you know how how long we're supposed to talk or do they tell you 

277.49 278.99 A: and the first one was from uh 

279.80 280.10 A: from 

280.73 283.26 A: oh philadelphia some guy from philadelphia 

281.73 282.27 B: uh huh 

284.78 289.49 A: (( so jackson )) philadelphia so we talked for a few minutes and he had to said he had to cut it short he had stuff to do 

288.04 288.49 B: uh huh 

290.51 293.18 A: so uh so what part of kentucky are you from 

291.44 292.67 B: i'm in louisville 

294.80 297.19 A: oh yeah my daughter i got a daughter that lives up there in uh 

297.95 302.01 A: in hartford and i hear it's going to be really cold there they've had a lot of snow 

300.41 301.75 B: yeah it's been uh 

301.86 304.74 B: it's been cold very cold here uh too 

305.03 307.11 B: and we were supposed to get a big storm 

307.68 308.73 B: uh but uh 

309.03 311.30 B: uh we didn't we only got maybe 

311.40 313.64 B: oh just a light covering on the ground 

314.06 316.01 B: let's see they were first they were saying like 

316.21 323.55 B: uh three to six inches but uh we only got uh a little bit i guess it bypassed us for some reason 

326.97 328.68 A: talking to you like i said (( may ah )) 

328.88 333.13 A: i think they ought to have just have a bunch of maybe some stricter laws and guidelines for those people 

331.98 336.69 B: yeah i think they need somebody that they have to answer to that's that's the thing that they're not just 

336.81 337.24 B: (( free to )) 

337.74 340.02 B: uh to just you know do 

340.13 341.30 B: do whatever they want 

341.97 349.54 A: yeah i think that would cu- i think that would cut down on a lot of the scandals and a lot of the uh embezzlement and crooking and cheating going on up in ther- up in them businesses 

348.45 351.58 B: yes if if if they know that somebody is checking up on them 

351.94 352.87 B: and that uh 

352.97 359.10 B: can it you know investigate in what they're doing then i think they'd be they would be less apt to try something 

359.24 359.95 B: uh you know 

360.15 362.44 B: (( of )) all this uh stu- stuff going on 

366.02 368.22 B: it are are we supposed to talk any certain 

368.32 369.31 B: length of time 

371.39 375.16 A: i don't know like i said i'm very new at this i'd come across it on the internet 

373.81 377.12 B: uh huh i did too and i just registered today

389.80 393.42 B: all that much and ah i read what they had on their web site 

393.70 394.55 B: and um 

394.79 399.06 B: they said something i think they mentioned something about ten minutes or something but um 

399.73 401.55 B: uh some things you know 

401.65 402.25 B: uh 

402.74 403.25 B: there's 

403.79 404.43 B: you don't 

404.82 407.27 B: you don't have that much to say about it or there's not 

407.63 408.39 B: you know uh 

408.50 409.84 B: that much time involved 

411.81 416.53 A: yeah cause like i said i hear about it on the news all the time and like i said now it's what about a few months ago that 

416.66 417.18 B: uh huh 

416.83 417.21 A: big 

417.38 418.67 A: scandal with enron 

419.19 421.65 A: i remember seeing all that in the in the (( inquiry )) about all the 

422.14 424.43 A: part- big wild parties and 

424.83 425.87 A: going on with all them 

426.17 428.97 A: big businessmen and them taking them self big raises 

427.41 427.96 B: mhm 

428.48 429.44 B: yeah it's 

429.80 432.46 B: i know it's sad because it's the little people that lose 

430.48 430.86 A: so 

432.62 433.07 B: you know 

433.40 440.43 B: uh lose their money and have to have to suffer for it and i'm sure they probably would never be able to recover their losses 

438.59 439.02 A: yeah 

442.33 445.27 A: oh no that's why i don't think i ever put my money in any kind of business 

443.81 444.33 B: mhm 

444.73 445.58 B: i know it's 

446.19 447.34 B: it's rough and it's uh 

447.45 448.06 B: it's uh 

448.33 449.84 B: scary you know and like i say it's 

450.59 452.08 B: if you can afford to 

452.20 458.38 B: you know try investing in something that you can afford to lose the money then maybe it's okay 

458.57 459.32 B: but um 

459.55 464.91 B: i'd say for the average people these days they can't afford to lose any money 

466.54 471.06 A: talk about (( )) i need all mine to spend on q._v._c. shopping network 

468.83 471.15 B: yeah 

472.11 477.74 A: (( )) home shopping network or ebay or any pl- any of those good places 

476.11 477.68 B: right
