403.07 408.20 B: yea i haven't personally experienced it but i know that it it it's 

408.39 418.30 B: you know it's out there like here in new jersey the n._j._i._t. the new jersey institute of technology and there really that's the college i went to and there really 

416.78 417.21 A: huh-huh 

418.80 425.97 B: there there growing by leaps and bounds too and and that's one of the areas where i where i heard that they are doing 

426.44 431.89 B: like people taking graduate courses there have virtual class rooms 

428.82 429.19 A: huh-huh 

432.62 440.02 B: that that's more than just a the class that i've taken so far are just totally automated 

433.51 433.96 A: oh 

440.15 440.84 B: there's no 

441.00 446.48 B: you know you can take them whenever you want it's just distance learning 

446.60 447.38 B: basically 

446.98 447.61 A: right 

447.58 448.08 B: yea it 

447.86 456.44 A: right but now when you take one of these classes you read the material online and then take a test after a portion is done 

454.73 457.00 B: right yes 

457.18 457.61 A: huh 

457.67 459.61 B: yea and huh 

458.01 463.04 A: and then at the end of that you would take a master test of an exam 

463.27 463.65 B: well 

464.14 467.09 B: some are on like the 

467.43 470.45 B: introductory level the course like 

476.64 486.59 B: you watch this screen of screens after you see so many you may hum 

481.46 481.80 A: yea 

487.39 491.11 B: you take a test it's up to you to take notes or not 

490.98 491.90 A: oh 

491.31 494.36 B: that that's on the beginner level 

494.77 504.91 B: on the intermediate level there's an online portion and there's an in person person in the old days they tell me the in person ones 

502.00 502.35 A: mm 

505.51 514.99 B: for instance would be a four week course you would go for eight hours a day five days a week for four weeks but now they broke it up where 

511.38 511.80 A: right 

515.14 516.02 B: half of it 

516.28 527.70 B: or actually more than half is online and you do it the same way like i just said with the beginner courses you watch all these screens go by you take a test after so many 

525.74 526.14 A: huh-huh 

528.11 537.09 B: what you'll learn instead of a four week in person course it's a one week now you really 

533.10 533.78 A: oh 

534.63 535.21 A: huh 

537.33 544.26 B: now if you cheated you just cheated because if you didn't you didn't huh 

544.36 550.89 B: because like the way you can cheat i watch the screens go by i can just print the screen 

550.91 552.07 A: oh i see 

551.75 553.91 B: i can hit the print screen button 

554.25 556.68 B: and i'll have a stack of papers 

556.88 558.91 A: oh so you can skim through them 

557.15 558.40 B: of the screen 

558.84 561.29 B: right and then when the test comes up i'll just look it up 

561.49 562.30 A: right i see 

562.05 562.47 B: yea 

562.56 563.10 A: i see 

562.56 563.18 B: so that 

563.32 575.21 B: may even no be cheating i remember when i got to the senior level of classes in college for my bachelors they were open book test you so it's 

564.17 564.51 A: yea 

571.74 572.86 A: that's right yea 

573.08 573.41 A: yea 

585.62 589.20 A: can you reproduce it in a comprehensive way 

589.37 594.34 A: hum in analytical way and your welcome to use any resource that you choose just have to 

594.85 598.56 A: answer my exam was ten questions and it was a hum
