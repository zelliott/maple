125.65 126.11 B: (( )) 

125.67 130.71 A: that's a very good decision by the way for the next oh five or ten years 

130.46 130.79 B: yep 

130.85 131.41 A: um 

132.32 134.87 A: kids should be in their own home for christmas i think 

134.93 135.71 B: yeah that that's 

135.85 142.87 B: but you know it's kind of my wife was pushing it and you know me you know i'm used to having it at my mom's house so if it's not at my mom's house it didn't seem like christmas but 

140.86 141.25 A: yeah 

142.69 143.31 A: yeah but 

143.13 144.78 B: it was it was really nice having it here 

144.27 145.85 A: but the children 

145.95 146.50 A: um 

146.88 153.80 A: to have their familiar surroundings and have their new toys and all their new goodies with them and not be pulled away on christmas day 

153.60 154.00 B: yeah 

153.98 156.11 A: i think it's really a nice thing too do 

156.14 158.69 B: christmas eve with have here christmas day we still go to her family's 

158.61 161.16 A: yeah but but well of course it was never as you know 

161.23 161.60 B: yeah 

162.22 167.72 A: you know what i mean whene- whenever you celebrate to have the time to have the kids have their own stuff not be 

162.25 163.41 B: it was it was nice to have 

168.65 169.58 A: um 

170.00 177.85 A: in my generation was kind of okay here's all your new christmas toys now we go visit everybody and you don't to see all your new stuff again 

176.95 180.52 B: yeah i have some relatives who do that my my nephew he went to 

181.29 184.62 B: i think between christmas and christmas day i think he went to six different houses 

185.01 185.41 A: yeah 

185.48 187.00 B: and they have a daughter who 

187.64 188.61 B: i think she's around two 

189.28 194.19 B: so i'm like man i mean she at one point i guess she was just like okay i just want to go home you can keep your presents just 

190.03 190.33 A: uh 

193.37 193.87 A: yes 

194.03 194.33 A: yeah 

194.57 198.80 A: just want to go home and rest i think what you're doing you know trying to keep the kids in 

199.31 202.11 A: uh uh a ah stable routine environment 

202.61 202.99 B: yeah 

202.63 208.51 A: and something they're totally familiar with i think that really makes christmas much more to them and makes it more of a family thing 

208.78 209.66 B: yeah i think so 

209.73 211.65 A: and we had to fight our family to do it 

212.31 217.54 A: uh my mother wanted christmas at her house no matter what when our kids were that age it was like 

217.94 222.03 A: you can come to me everybody can come to me i don't care for the children 

219.28 219.68 B: yeah 

222.26 223.07 A: they need this 

223.33 223.66 B: yep 

223.77 225.33 A: they need not to be dragged 

226.20 232.82 A: to have some time you know in front of the t- the tree the tree is all lit up it all so pretty and then you just look at them and say okay you saw the tree 

232.99 235.12 A: let's go 

234.64 239.39 B: there was it was probably about ten twelve years ago my parents bought a artificial tree it's about three feet tall 

239.86 245.17 B: can't and they bought it with the lights on it and take it upstairs every every year and set it on the table and plug it in 

245.34 247.32 B: so my mom is more than happy to uh 

247.63 249.11 B: because my parents are both in their seventies 

249.51 249.94 A: yeah 

249.77 250.85 B: and and they were more than 

251.38 255.18 B: happy to say okay someone else can do christmas eve because yo know they've done it for 

255.86 261.70 B: now see my sister is fifty so yo know they've done it long enough and they're just okay great somebody else do it so 

258.01 258.47 A: yeah 

261.85 266.55 A: well you're lucky that they were willing to let it go because our my parents weren't willing to let it go i mean my mother was 

266.78 276.99 A: pretty much on her deathbed telling her the oncologist well she took the holidays away from me i mean you want them back you want to cook this year 

276.51 279.27 B: yeah my mom actually called to thank me oh thank you for taking 

278.49 279.29 A: yeah 

279.69 286.19 A: this is that's that's the way i feel and it's like i said it's great when they one year my daughter in law just said you know i feel like doing thanksgiving this year 

286.61 287.06 A: okay 

287.45 288.26 B: yeah exactly 

288.25 290.50 A: and now it goes out and you know and plus she's 

290.75 292.59 A: breaking the tradition i don't like turkey 

292.84 293.56 A: i really don't 

293.74 301.14 A: and for the first year that my daughter in law said i think i'll do christmas this year if you guys don't mind which is really sweet um 

301.57 302.72 A: she did individual 

303.32 304.15 A: cornish game hens 

304.28 304.91 B: oh that's cool 

304.52 306.18 A: we had so much fun 

306.85 309.12 A: and now it's like okay we don't need 

309.47 312.16 A: the country's traditions as much as we need our own traditions 

312.26 313.12 B: right 

313.11 315.64 A: so we're making our own and we're having a blast it it 

315.18 315.66 B: and it's 

315.76 318.80 B: that's why we're planning to start having christmas eve here because we run a 

319.32 321.56 B: she would say we we need to get traditions for our kids 

321.79 324.28 B: what we do on christmas eve what we do on christmas morning 

324.67 326.55 B: as opposed to dragging them to the other families 

324.76 325.20 A: yeah 

326.71 327.10 B: to 

327.26 328.36 B: partake in what they do 

328.47 328.98 A: yeah 

329.03 338.97 B: so you know i like we just brought out a one of those spiral cut hams and had ham my family for christmas eve has always been we don't really sit down for a big meal we just graze all day 

338.89 340.53 A: great 

340.22 345.08 B: you know we have we have shrimp and and (( )) sandwiches and we have the ham and 

341.66 342.02 A: well 

345.04 345.43 A: yeah 

345.34 351.99 B: so it was different what what we used to do my mom you know she used to try to get a meal but that was probably what five or six years ago she kind of 

352.58 353.18 B: just great 

352.95 353.39 A: hm 

353.87 354.59 A: and that's that's the 

354.73 356.85 A: that's great because it should be 

357.18 365.91 A: it should be what you want and the kids want not what somebody three generations or four generations ago started doing and everybody feels like they have to do it that way now 

359.14 359.70 B: right 

366.09 373.92 B: right like it's like there's there's one thing my wife's family does for christmas which i absolutely hate they put clues on the tags for presents 

373.78 374.41 A: oh 

374.48 381.70 B: like for socks they'll say these will keep your feet warm well it takes all the joy out of it to me it takes all the joy of opening presents because you read the clue 

381.50 382.16 A: uh yeah 

382.17 384.50 B: you now know what's inside the box you might as well just 

384.91 386.93 B: put it over in the corner and take it home 

385.40 390.45 A: why why bother unwrapping it just to see what color it is 

387.09 387.66 B: i mean it's it's 

390.03 393.62 B: yeah so every present i wrap i put on the clue don't eat this 

394.53 395.61 B: unless it's food 

395.76 396.26 B: then i write 

396.41 397.17 B: okay to eat 

397.55 405.35 B: that that's my clue i mean that that's it if you can figure it out from that great but it's just it's so anticlimactic because everybody in the room is guessing what it is 

403.30 404.01 A: yeah 

405.58 408.77 A: w- when you said clues yo made me think of something my 

409.00 409.71 A: daughter in laws 

410.12 413.28 A: family does i think it's it's at easter instead of easter egg hunts 

413.47 413.83 B: mhm 

414.01 415.83 A: they make these little poems these clues 

416.28 420.35 A: and they have these these cute little thoughtful very inexpensive gifts for everybody 

420.42 421.00 B: oh that's cool 

421.10 423.14 A: but they're hidden all around the house 

429.85 431.60 B: sounds like blues clues for adults 

430.50 438.56 A: and you got people running all around the house looking for (( )) oh it's hysterical it's an adult easter egg hunt 

439.16 445.15 A: without the eggs so if something doesn't get found at least you don't have it rotting in a corner some place 

450.21 450.55 B: i'm 

450.65 452.57 B: exactly (( )) but um 

452.69 455.03 B: they hid easter eggs for me and i didn't find a bunch of them 

455.70 457.25 B: so next year we found them 

457.24 458.83 A: oh ick 

458.76 462.04 B: we no it's weird my mother in law never smelled them in her house 

462.56 467.92 B: but yeah it was a year later that we found some of the eggs like oh this one doesn't look so good oh it's from last year 

466.69 469.15 A: you're you're mother in law does not have a dog or cat 

469.15 470.19 B: no 

469.27 474.37 A: my dog would have definitely found them 

474.26 474.84 B: yeah 

475.11 476.35 B: but it was pretty funny 

476.17 478.26 A: oh that is hysterical 

478.85 485.81 A: and then then of course you get the discussion uh excuse me but when is the last time you cleaned that corner 

482.99 486.85 B: yeah that's that's exactly what it was i looked and i said pretty thorough cleaning huh 

488.82 492.22 A: that could happen to my house 

492.80 494.42 A: oh that's wild 

494.66 495.67 A: that's wild was 

494.84 496.14 B: yeah that was pretty funny 

495.88 497.37 A: sounds like you have a great family 

497.57 500.05 B: yeah i like it i i like my in laws and and uh 

500.19 501.77 B: you know my family likes my wife and 

502.43 504.68 B: you know of course there's a black sheep in every family but you know 

505.01 505.94 B: which one doesn't 

505.86 510.78 A: well you know one of the things that the keeps i think that keeps the marriage going because 

510.01 510.76 B: yeah 

510.98 511.48 A: with 

511.79 512.82 A: in our case 

513.49 516.52 A: if my son and his wife got split up i'm not letting her go 

516.66 522.84 A: he better hang on to her peter because i'm not letting her go
