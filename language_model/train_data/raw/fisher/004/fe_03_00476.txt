189.59 190.41 B: oh i don't 

190.96 195.44 B: i don't understand how you can have a un-carbohydrate diet that's when i crave 

195.22 198.13 A: i did it for like four hours and i thought i was going to die 

198.67 201.09 B: i don't even know that i would last that long 

201.50 202.16 B: but 

201.68 202.12 A: well 

202.52 205.65 A: yeah it it was hard i i just don't think that i'm cut out for that 

206.28 211.37 B: i don't think i am either th- there was i guy i worked with who had great success with it 

211.56 212.91 B: i couldn't do it 

213.09 215.13 B: when are you sitting there and eating all this meat and stuff uh 

213.28 218.55 A: yeah i don't really like meat too much and i don't really like cheese so that's pretty much what they tell you to eat 

218.95 222.34 B: yeah and i love cheese but i couldn't live on cheese alone 

222.68 228.68 A: yeah i was i kind of like it too but i started to not like it after just like there like have a snack of cheese 

222.98 224.57 B: i can't imagine not having 

228.50 231.25 B: here just eat a hunk of cheese 

231.17 235.48 A: yeah my friends and i were planning our like pre-college diet so we'd go there and be all 

236.00 238.10 A: i don't know in shape but we'd we'd 

238.69 241.30 A: got rid of that idea after about four hours 

242.34 252.51 B: i remember for me i was so worried about getting like (( )) fifteen when i was in college that i was like under such a strict diet um 

248.24 248.88 A: yeah 

252.77 255.78 B: and i just i can't stick with that very long 

256.05 256.64 A: yeah 

256.11 256.67 B: but 

257.72 262.84 B: oh wow what else do i like i like cookies i like baking things i think 

263.18 267.05 A: yeah i'm more of a baker i don't really cook like meals but i'll make cookies and stuff a lot 

263.25 265.07 B: as opposed to 

267.40 269.91 B: yeah me too i just made peanut butter cookies yesterday 

270.22 270.72 A: hmm 

270.38 270.86 B: ow 

271.39 274.64 A: i really like making christmas cookies and frosting and that's always fun 

275.02 276.10 B: ooh that is fun 

276.35 277.86 B: have you ever made ginger bread cookies 

278.04 278.84 A: yeah 

279.58 280.14 A: that's fun 

282.49 282.97 A: oh 

290.90 294.63 A: oh one time we put gingerbread men on our tree but they were made out of like glue 

295.15 300.06 A: and then (( )) had a babysitter you'd try to eat them i remember that i was really little (( )) remember that happening 

295.33 296.21 B: oh 

302.60 307.17 B: uh anyway so okay so what do we do then i guess when we're done with the conversation do they come in and tell us 

306.46 308.94 A: i think we can just hang up i don't think we have to do anything 

309.36 310.66 B: okay cause i (( )) 

310.10 311.69 A: i don't know i've never done this before 

310.94 311.79 B: first live action 

311.91 315.40 B: neither have i so an i know they said you're supposed to talk 

314.22 315.83 A: it's all kind of strange but 

316.23 320.38 B: yeah you're supposed to talk for ten minutes i think hold on a second i'm on a cell i can check 

320.04 320.49 A: okay 

321.94 323.71 B: i think it's only been probably like six 

323.87 324.77 B: but i'm not 

324.23 324.74 A: okay 

325.12 327.02 B: i'm not sure what else we're supposed to do i 

327.38 329.84 B: i really kind of exhausted the food topic 

330.50 333.42 A: i think it's it's probably good enough i don't know 

334.00 335.29 B: okay well i guess 

335.40 339.06 B: if i (( )) don't get a check then it'll know that we have to wait longer 

339.10 340.21 A: yeah 

340.44 341.64 B: talk longer or something 

342.98 347.49 B: but all right okay well here maybe this will extend the conversation if you were going to plan like 

347.87 353.06 B: like a really romantic meal for valentine's day or something what would you want like what would you plan to have 

350.89 351.42 A: oh 

353.57 354.99 A: well let me think here 

355.51 358.85 B: assuming you didn't have to do any of the cooking or cleaning up 

358.56 360.51 A: oh that would be nice i hate cleaning up 

360.87 361.81 B: i do too 

361.09 362.48 A: i guess that 

362.64 365.32 A: i would have my boyfriend really likes 

365.64 367.29 A: salmon so 

367.67 369.19 A: i guess he'd want to have that 

369.93 376.44 A: and i i really like asparagus a lot so i but but i never buy it cause i i don't know i don't really know how to make it 

376.56 378.88 A: and probably some sort of chocolate cake 

379.78 381.12 A: maybe some 

379.90 380.63 B: ooh
