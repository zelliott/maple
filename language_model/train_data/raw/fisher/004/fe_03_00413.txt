21.44 22.67 A: mhm 

22.07 27.38 B: ah life is very different for me ah i have a family bush as opposed to a family tree 

26.80 28.11 A: [laughter] 

29.02 30.09 A: how so 

30.31 42.38 B: um mom and dad divorced kids living in separate states step parents remarriages um deaths in the family it really altered the fa- the traditional family structure 

34.79 35.47 A: mhm 

42.16 43.06 A: okay 

43.35 44.22 B: how 'bout 

43.40 55.45 A: i i actually am the on- one of the people i know that still has the fifties my parents are still together they're about to celebrate their fortieth wedding anniversary um 

51.52 52.35 B: mhm 

55.51 68.35 A: you know so we had the two and half kids you know i have a brother and a sister and me and it it has always been very strange in that it's together and everybody else i know it's very different for 

58.30 59.10 B: mhm 

68.26 76.90 B: well see that's where you and i are are different my father's with my stepmother my own mother ah died when i was six months of age 

72.38 73.34 A: mhm 

76.39 77.23 A: okay 

77.14 80.81 B: and my father eventually remarried when i was six years old 

80.28 81.20 A: mhm 

80.90 87.39 B: and then introduced the stepfamily so i have br- my natural brothers and i have stepsisters 

84.99 86.10 A: mhm 

87.24 88.12 A: okay 

87.83 92.68 B: which brings another parent into the situation because they have their father 

92.45 93.37 A: okay 

93.21 96.73 B: so it's you know dad deceased mom 

96.83 100.26 B: stepmother and then stepmother's ex husband 

99.88 101.06 A: (( wow [noise] )) 

101.95 102.88 A: (( you have )) 

102.13 106.23 B: so it it made for very interesting family dynamics [noise] [noise] 

105.25 113.06 A: definitely you you have the big immediate family while i have the big extended family my father was one of ten kids 

106.24 107.32 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

112.65 114.41 B: (( [noise] mhm mm )) 

113.23 121.84 A: and and so i have i have two ah one brother one sister i have twenty five cousins so i have a very very large family that way 

122.36 135.22 B: i'm similar my father had seven siblings and there are there are tens of tonnes of cousins and in that way it's still very traditional it's just you know my dad seemed to have br- broke the mould because my mother died 

125.07 125.85 A: (( oh yeah )) 

127.70 128.66 A: mhm 

134.96 135.88 A: (( uh-huh okay )) 

137.18 149.50 A: that's interesting families i i've i've always i've had a lot of people comment to me that that they they actually find it odd that that my parents are still together we still kind of have that nuc- nuclear family going 

138.58 140.79 B: (( hm )) 

149.48 156.79 B: mhm well my stepparents have been together um well my stepmother and father have been together for tw- twenty plus years now 

156.36 157.61 A: mhm 

156.98 171.81 B: um so essentially i mean they're doing fine they've stayed married [noise] they did not have any children together um so that that that made things kind of awkward in in that it was always yours and my kids it was there was never an our child 

162.10 162.88 A: okay 

168.73 169.74 A: mhm 

171.08 171.87 A: okay 

172.15 176.34 A: do you do you think that that helped between the siblings or was different 

172.16 173.09 B: (( um )) 

176.48 181.66 A: i i've heard different i mean i haven't an opinion it i've heard people say different things about that 

181.43 187.40 B: well for me i always wanted a little brother or sister i was the youngest so i always wanted somebody else younger than 

184.96 185.71 A: okay 

187.24 200.86 B: then myself and when i asked they said no and that was the end of the su- end of the topic um m- my siblings were all older um middle school high school and older they had they adjusted much better than i did 

192.05 192.85 A: uh-huh 

197.77 198.53 A: okay 

200.35 201.17 A: okay 

202.39 209.83 B: and and i see that even in my own daughter's ah circle of friends these days a lot of single families households 

207.34 207.90 A: (( mm )) 

209.51 210.28 A: okay 

210.22 220.59 B: where there isn't even a stepmom or a stepdad a lot of times the parents are divorced sometimes mom has a boyfriend sometimes she doesn't and and they're they're they're living by themselves [noise] 

220.03 220.73 A: (( mm )) 

220.96 221.69 A: mm 

221.89 230.65 A: that that's interesting um reminds me my even though like my parents is once they um my brother had been married and divorced once 

230.34 231.55 B: mhm 

230.98 235.66 A: and he has one son my sister has been married and divorced three times 

235.74 239.32 A: and she has one son from her her second marriage 

239.18 240.01 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

239.32 240.57 A: and 

240.53 245.98 A: and she has a boyfriend who has two children and then her 

245.90 252.83 A: ex husband who she had the son with has another son from a a previous relationship 

252.75 267.61 A: and it it's interesting that my sister is actually closer to her ex stepson if that makes sense than than her ex husband is you know like they they actually got in contact again with one another and are able to spend time with one another 

259.87 260.66 B: (( mhm )) 

267.31 268.42 B: mhm 

267.83 269.07 A: again so 

269.17 271.45 A: here comes extended family out that way 

271.07 276.05 B: yeah it does get peculiar my um my when my oldest stepsister got married 

275.55 276.27 A: mhm 

276.14 283.49 B: ah as i said she's she's my stepmother's daughter well her father went and remarried and had three additional children 

279.09 279.77 A: (( okay )) 

283.23 284.35 A: mhm 

283.70 292.03 B: so here we are in southern texas trying to explain that this is my sister this is my sister and this is my sister's sister 

291.76 293.32 A: [laughter] 

292.47 294.33 B: but she's not my sister 

294.27 295.45 A: mhm 

294.81 301.70 B: and getting stunned glazed looks by the very religious bible belt family we were trying to explain this all to 

299.61 300.33 A: yeah 

301.28 304.73 A: i'm from georgia so i i understand [laughter] [laughter] 

303.66 316.96 B: [laughter] okay and i i just think it i don't know how middle america lives but i know on the east coast in my circle of friends there seems to be more fragmented families than there are whole families 

309.21 310.03 A: uh-huh 

316.37 317.60 A: definitely 

318.58 320.38 A: (( definitely agree with that )) 

321.67 323.03 A: hm interesting 

323.04 324.13 A: um 

324.68 327.31 A: i don't know i'm drawing a blank on all this [laughter] 

326.68 332.02 B: well i mean are are you close with family do you see your nieces and nephews even though there have been 

332.75 334.70 B: sep- some some changes 

332.93 333.73 A: um 

334.63 339.13 A: ye- yes and geography has a lot to do with that 

338.85 339.71 B: mhm 

339.43 344.01 A: all of us for the most part live in and around atlanta 

343.72 345.00 B: mhm 

344.25 354.09 A: and um but my brother's son is still in kentucky and because of that i don't see him very often my ex sister in law 

348.53 349.69 B: mhm 

353.91 360.31 A: i just found out is getting remarried and basically kind of starting anew and and 

360.10 371.31 A: ah when they first got divorced like she made a whole lot of effort to bring my nephew down and visit you know his grandparent and visit my family and now that seems to be trailing off a little bit 

368.03 368.83 B: mhm 

370.14 371.03 B: sure 

371.17 375.37 A: and um but otherwise yeah i kind of see my family 

375.86 384.02 A: most most of my family at least once a month just because they're close i'm potentially getting a job soon that will have 

379.77 380.62 B: mhm 

384.32 388.94 A: put me to some place else in the country and i have a feeling that'll change things 

388.53 396.20 B: [noise] that's gonna be difficult ah i was close with my younger stepsister and she up and moved to florida about six years ago 

392.70 393.57 A: mhm 

395.95 396.73 A: okay 

396.64 409.84 B: and it went from seeing her every holidays seeing the niece and the nephew the brother in law you know and going over on an occasional saturday and having a spaghetti dinner [noise] all that [noise] suddenly got pulled away [noise] and i found that very distressing [noise] 

409.62 410.87 A: mhm 

410.21 420.60 B: you know that support system that we had whether she was hiding christmas presents at my place or we just went and had a cup of coffee together the sanity that we shared 

420.61 423.73 B: i miss that i lost that piece of family 

423.09 436.10 A: yeah yeah i can see that my my sister and i are very very close we're very different me me and my brother and sister i'd say if if you took the same person and split them three different ways you'd have us 

429.99 430.78 B: mhm 

435.78 436.81 B: [laughter] 

436.47 443.20 A: 'cause at the core we're very much the same but you know our lives are just very very different and our views are very different on certain things 

443.21 451.17 A: but ah her and i are very close and that would that would hurt a lot if you know i lost whatever with her on a normal basis 

450.50 458.67 B: [mn] [mn] [mn] yeah well see that's what i'm concerned i'm hearing it hearing that might happen to you i mean that that distance really i mean i'm 

455.00 455.92 A: yeah 

458.31 460.68 A: i've done it before i've been away before 

458.79 459.95 B: any oh 

460.34 470.52 B: i'm in pennsylvania and she's in florida so that's that's an eighteen twenty hour automobile drive or at least a couple of hours on an airplane it's expense 

461.86 462.68 A: (( oh yeah )) 

463.25 464.04 A: okay 

466.68 467.63 A: yeah 

470.55 475.26 B: and um it does you do lose some of the closeness that was there 

474.67 477.12 A: mhm hm 

477.27 484.08 A: ah hopefully that won't happen i may be going closer rather than further so maybe that will that will be a very good thing 

481.32 483.05 B: that would be a good thing 

484.09 497.03 A: um going back to something you said earlier it's kind of interesting that you're the youngest and wanted a si- a younger sibling i'm the youngest and never wanted a y- a younger sibling i was always completely fine that i was youngest and um 

497.10 507.87 A: ah my sister's eight years older and my brother's six years old than i am so i kind of had the the two lives of being a younger sibling and kind of being an only child at the same time 

507.48 508.47 B: (( [noise] mhm mhm [noise] )) 

508.00 522.99 A: 'cause by the time i was in late middle school to high school both my brother and sister had completely moved out [noise] so i kind of had both of those lives together and just was an interesting childhood where i was able to bond with my brother and sister and bond with my parents 

513.38 514.25 B: (( mhm [mn] mhm )) 

523.03 525.89 A: in in very different ways 

525.23 535.95 B: yeah it's just that my closest closest sibling is six years older than i am and then i have two that are ten years older than i am and then one that's fourteen years older than i 

529.89 530.63 A: okay 

535.31 535.99 A: (( [mn] oh )) 

536.23 539.51 B: am and it gets to be a real gap 

539.28 540.68 A: mhm 

540.03 547.88 B: you know it my i was entering kindergarten and my oldest sister was working out in the real world 

547.48 548.43 A: wow 

548.27 551.95 B: and she was legally able to drink alcohol and vote 

551.43 553.15 A: [laughter] 

552.36 556.38 B: [laughter] so we didn't have a whole lot in common 

555.87 557.73 A: [laughter] no 

558.69 561.16 A: no i could see that 

560.36 565.47 B: [sigh] and and that's some of the reason why i wanted somebody else around the house i wanted somebody to play with 

565.06 566.14 A: yeah 

566.39 569.95 A: yeah i guess my brother and sister were close enough they picked on me a whole lot 

569.93 582.57 A: but like looking back and and my sister'll make comments every now and then of i think she kind of saw me as as like her pre daughter [laughter] that she could kind of practice and and and you know 

577.76 579.63 B: (( mm )) 

582.61 592.06 A: with her with her son right now she'll make comments i'll be like well how are you going to deal with him about x. situation she'll be like well this is what i did with you and that seems to have worked out okay 

592.21 595.73 A: yeah but i had another set of parents besides you at the same time 

595.69 596.41 B: (( [noise] mm )) 

596.33 597.75 A: (( need to work it out )) 

597.93 599.89 B: it is interesting though but you know you get
