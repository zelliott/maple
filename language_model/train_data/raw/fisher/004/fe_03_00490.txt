22.93 24.19 B: (( oh okay )) 

23.54 29.68 A: so it's easier not to get [laughter] sick but every year i get sick [laughter] so 

25.72 27.49 B: [laughter] 

28.86 31.98 B: how cold how cold does it get in the wintertime 

31.55 38.58 A: um it's been cold this month and the coldest that it's gotten i think was seventeen 

38.52 40.03 B: oh wow that's not 

38.97 41.14 A: and that was really cold [laughter] 

40.44 42.61 B: yeah that is cold that is pretty

58.25 59.07 B: yeah 

62.14 63.89 B: (( oh wow [mn] )) 

62.97 65.25 A: and i'm a college student [laughter] 

64.72 67.59 B: oh my goodness that must be really tough [mn] 

67.12 70.03 A: yeah it is horrible [laughter] 

69.31 70.95 B: [laughter] 

70.09 72.54 A: i thought it would be really easy 

72.38 73.60 B: oh 

72.60 75.92 A: i thought you know it'll be so easy but it's not 

75.83 76.95 B: oh wow 

76.09 84.61 A: so i i i try to keep my health i you know i try to do things that i know are good for me um and i did get a flu shot this year 

77.03 77.59 B: (( [mn] )) 

79.05 80.20 B: yeah 

84.30 86.50 B: yeah i got a flu shot as well 

84.70 85.44 A: (( [mn] )) 

86.17 92.57 A: so it seems that i haven't gotten really sick this year so i'm crossing my fingers and hoping that it [laughter] doesn't happen 

91.15 92.47 B: yeah 

92.76 100.59 B: so do your kids get sick more easily in the wintertime do you think uh do they get more easily uh sick more easily than adults do 

100.83 101.59 A: no 

101.91 105.53 A: i i think they are m- they are more 

106.49 109.17 A: resistant than we are yes 

107.67 110.20 B: really oh wow okay 

109.24 110.61 A: i really do [lipsmack] 

110.96 112.52 B: i wouldn't have thought so 

111.05 115.86 A: and i think what [mn] i think when they do get sick though it's it's usually in the summer 

115.85 117.02 B: oh okay 

115.92 120.25 A: or or at the very end of the summer where the seasons are changing 

119.42 120.77 B: (( when are )) 

120.88 121.95 A: yeah 

121.06 122.83 B: not ready for the cold 

122.48 125.21 A: yeah that's usually when it is 

123.33 124.43 B: i got it 

125.06 126.79 B: [laughter] 

125.93 129.14 A: but normally they're usually they're in pretty good health 

129.60 130.44 A: (( [laughter] )) 

130.24 143.18 B: i would think that i would've thought that kids would get sick more easily and then you're going to get sick because all your kids are sick maybe because i think they're going to school they're meeting a lot of other kids who are you know who have a flu or have a cold as well 

142.34 147.99 A: yeah well it that's funny because usually my husband is the one that brings it home 

147.42 148.72 B: [laughter] 

148.26 155.31 A: and then the kids get it and i am the last one to get it and i always keep it longer than anyone else 

151.80 152.80 B: [laughter] 

154.12 158.00 B: oh no because you're taking care of everybody else i'm sure 

156.78 159.17 A: yeah [laughter] yes 

158.19 159.05 B: i think 

159.17 165.00 B: yeah you spend your energy doing all this stuff and then you're going to get ill as well 

164.55 167.45 A: (( and then no one's here to take care of me [laughter] )) 

166.67 172.46 B: [laughter] that's right oh my gosh and see so much responsibility 

167.61 170.19 A: i have to go to school anyway [laughter] 

172.08 173.47 A: yeah it's 

172.74 174.03 B: yeah 

173.54 175.72 A: you just have to balance it 

175.18 180.32 B: mhm do you think do you think that going to the doctor helps when you have a cold 

175.79 176.96 A: (( you just have )) 

180.21 184.12 A: yeah i i think that sometimes 

181.23 182.12 B: yeah 

184.44 196.62 A: sometimes now sometimes when you know you just have something that doesn't matter what they give you sometimes i go and they say well there's nothing we can do you just just take this and do this and i think 

190.22 191.39 B: yeah 

193.34 194.69 B: i know 

196.57 205.30 A: i came here because i wanted to get better but there's really sometimes there's nothing they can do but i but i am a doctor person [laughter] 

197.72 198.75 B: [laughter] 

199.75 200.69 B: i know 

202.28 203.59 B: i think [mn] 

204.94 206.28 B: oh 

205.81 208.54 A: i believe in the medical field [laughter] 

207.64 219.31 B: [laughter] they always send me antibiotics home but i don't think it helps at all i mean if i just stay in bed and rest a lot have lots of water i think that will help more than anything else 

219.37 224.54 B: and then you also have to go to the doctor then you go outside and it's cold and you're feeling awful so 

223.96 225.41 A: (( i know [laughter] )) 

225.24 226.27 B: yeah 

225.99 235.03 A: usually usually you do get better on your own your body if you're [noise] normal and your healthy your body will recuperate by itself normally 

231.29 232.13 B: yeah 

234.11 234.84 B: yeah 

234.89 236.65 B: definitely definitely 

237.04 243.04 B: [laughter] i don't know um [laughter] what else uh 

243.70 251.05 B: do you think a lot of other students like i think for us a lot of students here will get sick all at the same time 

250.94 264.99 B: so we'll be living in a dorm together and i mean one person will catch it and the whole entire um you know floor will have it too because we have communal showers we have um communal living spaces you know living rooms so 

262.76 264.25 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

264.16 271.13 A: that makes sense [laughter] well we because i don't live in the dorms i can't say that much but i do know that 

265.46 266.53 B: yeah 

268.30 269.57 B: yeah mhm 

270.16 271.08 B: right 

271.00 285.09 A: um because i'm in my upper level classes now so um most everyone that is in my field we take all the same classes so we're around each other all day every day 

274.15 275.64 B: uh-huh right 

281.01 282.13 B: oh okay 

282.86 283.97 B: yeah 

284.99 287.66 A: so we do end up passing 

285.02 285.92 B: yeah 

287.71 294.06 A: i'm telling you that flu shot [laughter] because i haven't gotten anything yet but almost everyone has had it 

289.62 291.06 B: [laughter] 

294.08 295.57 B: yeah 

294.99 307.08 A: so i'm i i try to say god please don't let me get it [laughter] but everyone else has been sick this semester so far [laughter] [noise] but me and about three of my friends 

298.31 299.67 B: [laughter] 

304.30 305.56 B: yeah 

306.73 307.65 B: mhm 

307.15 311.81 A: [noise] so i i think uh it's it is easy [noise] to pass along a lot of things [noise] i 

311.14 316.51 B: i know i mean we've only started to come back to school but already i think people 

316.60 322.78 B: [noise] you're all somewhere else and you're maybe coming back from a long way 

318.75 319.84 A: (( think it's the )) 

321.02 321.89 A: (( shock of coming )) 

322.80 337.57 A: back from holidays too [noise] [noise] yeah and i that that too can affect it i think when you travel or when you get i know it was hard to go back this semester [laughter] and getting back in the groove because of the break was so long 

333.20 335.80 B: yeah that's right 

336.04 337.21 B: any stress 

337.52 338.80 B: any stress 

337.60 338.25 A: it 

338.32 345.94 A: yeah though well the break was so long i i've been going and going and going and i'm not taking breaks and 

341.12 342.09 B: yeah 

345.78 346.84 B: yeah 

346.19 355.61 A: usually the summer break is [noise] it i don't know maybe the summer just seem to pass more swiftly than uh the low cold winter [laughter] [noise] 

350.90 352.38 B: [laughter] 

353.16 363.93 B: that's true but it's always nice to look forward to i think in the springtime at least things get warmer and warmer it's awful in the fall when you know that every day is just going to be colder than the last 

356.33 356.89 A: [noise] 

361.37 370.04 A: [noise] [laughter] my children have decided they don't want to leave me alone 

367.89 369.21 B: (( oh that's )) 

369.45 373.71 B: oh no i can hear them in the background but [laughter] it's all right 

372.25 382.90 A: well they yeah well the kitty cat scratched him he seems to he's at that age and he will won't stay out of her face and she ends up biting him [laughter] 

375.67 376.48 B: (( yes )) 

380.57 381.19 B: (( mm )) 

382.17 383.65 B: (( how old are your kids )) 

383.81 390.12 A: um i have a five year old he'll be six in march and then i have a one year old who'll be two in [laughter] march 

386.95 387.74 B: uh-huh 

389.74 391.95 B: oh wow okay 

390.90 394.82 A: so they're little so it's even harder [laughter] sometimes 

392.42 398.42 B: yes they are very little it's kinda i know but i guess they have fun playing with e- playing with each other 

398.08 399.55 A: sometimes 

399.21 401.58 B: (( [laughter] you [mn] )) 

400.37 402.17 A: sometimes they fight 

402.05 405.90 B: oh the gap's pretty big though you know the 

402.83 403.79 A: so some- 

405.32 406.25 A: yeah 

406.03 407.22 B: age gap 

406.31 418.18 A: it's yeah mhm uh and that's what i thought but so many people say oh no they i've talked to people who've had kids that are like seventeen years apart i'm like you're crazy [laughter] 

407.66 408.62 B: [laughter] 

415.38 416.33 B: yeah 

417.06 418.34 B: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

418.24 431.15 A: 'cause i don't think i can handle it because i i mean you just have to start all over every time [noise] anything that you learned before was minimal compared to what the next one's going to teach you [laughter] yeah 

422.79 424.18 B: yeah i know 

426.75 427.64 B: [laughter] 

428.07 433.66 B: really you'd think that once you have one everything will pass through right 

433.05 437.93 A: yeah [laughter] it it's easy [noise] it's easy with the first one because 

434.14 435.30 B: oh wow 

437.02 437.92 B: yeah 

438.27 439.76 A: [noise] as far as 

440.09 442.27 A: you you don't know a lot 

442.17 443.13 B: mhm 

442.23 444.45 A: because you've never had kids but 

444.33 456.31 A: there's no one there for them to argue and fight and fuss with [laughter] you don't have to worry about sharing [laughter] and all of that 'cause i mean you do but really at a minimum point 

444.44 445.24 B: yeah 

448.29 450.04 B: yeah that's true 

452.07 454.15 B: yeah that's true 

456.13 460.88 A: you don't have to live with other people they have to share with [laughter] so 

456.28 457.05 B: yeah 

458.43 459.73 B: [laughter] 

460.06 464.22 B: they get all your attention too so then they're not jealous right 

464.29 466.41 A: yeah and i think 

466.73 469.08 A: speaking of that i think last year 

469.14 482.04 A: was it last year if not two thousand two but two thousand one the year that i had my son i was really i got sick really easy that year i was sick about four times i think it was just from 

477.09 478.44 B: oh wow 

480.28 481.06 B: is it 

482.01 484.45 A: i mean the weather has something to do with it but 

484.45 488.40 B: were you just really tired from just having given birth or 

486.26 486.97 A: (( yeah )) 

487.82 493.04 A: yeah your b- well i think your body just the baby takes so much from you 

493.06 503.34 A: and then your body has to like rebuild your you know your immunities and everything else because when you're pregnant they pump you so full of vitamins and 

499.61 500.38 B: (( hm mhm yeah )) 

502.91 504.38 B: [laughter] do they 

503.16 509.23 A: there's no way you're getting sick [laughter] i'm like yeah i'm the healthiest person alive [laughter] 

504.48 505.96 B: [laughter] 

508.10 509.47 B: [laughter] 

510.40 511.30 A: so 

510.70 518.10 B: so you just have to keep taking your vitamins [laughter] afterwards too i'm really bad at that i never remember to take my vitamins 

513.04 514.05 A: yeah 

514.80 515.73 A: yeah 

517.69 521.71 A: yeah i forget to take medication i don't wa- [laughter] it 

520.08 527.77 B: i know yeah i don't enjoy it i think that you should be able to get all your nutrients from your regular food but you know 

525.72 526.92 A: yeah 

526.98 528.71 A: but [laughter] 

528.76 533.23 A: but [laughter] we have we have that fast food diet 

530.07 531.22 B: (( but so )) 

532.55 534.27 B: yeah that's right 

533.47 546.74 A: society we do and yeah it is and sometimes it's it's just it is it is easier to you don't have time you have other things that you have to do and you're hungry 

535.09 537.05 B: it's convenient mhm 

546.77 547.55 A: (( [laughter] )) 

546.93 548.85 B: yeah that's right 

547.63 551.69 A: so you eat [laughter] what is available [laughter] 

549.53 550.83 B: [laughter] 

551.48 556.52 B: i know and it's cheap you know it makes it very easy for everyone to get into it 

556.17 562.45 A: yeah and i imagine s- especially for you because you're a college student you're away from home 

559.12 560.20 B: yeah 

560.40 562.11 B: yeah exactly 

562.15 564.89 B: and you don't want to be cooking yourself and 

564.28 567.79 A: yeah i can imagine [laughter] yes 

565.04 566.69 B: yeah definitely 

567.33 573.34 B: but no i mean with your kids i'm sure you have to cook a bit more and it's even more time consuming for you right 

573.93 586.19 A: sometimes sometimes i i don't cook very often um i i probably should cook more i i probably cook twice a week maybe sometimes sometimes i cook every day of the week 

574.02 574.90 B: yeah 

578.09 579.14 B: yeah 

583.43 584.24 B: okay
