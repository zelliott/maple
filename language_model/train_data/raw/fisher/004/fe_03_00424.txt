204.12 205.13 B: um 

207.19 207.95 B: that's 

208.59 211.37 B: i guess my family would be more like my friends 

211.90 212.89 B: than my 

213.09 214.34 B: because

242.95 243.90 B: mhm 

246.07 247.22 B: um 

246.77 250.07 A: [noise] my family [noise] 

251.23 254.25 A: see i told you the scale didn't break 

254.48 261.98 A: [noise] i don't know it's just an electronic scale they break periodically [noise] 

262.77 263.66 A: (( yes )) 

266.42 272.13 A: [noise] you know that that brings up a good topic that people you end up living with at dorms 

272.19 281.13 A: can also become [noise] part of a you know sort of your family as well because you're stuck with them for eight months a year 

282.29 283.15 B: (( uh-huh )) 

282.32 288.81 A: and you know if [noise] if you end up living with them in subsequent years then 

289.21 293.21 A: they can in effect become family especially if you guys you know 

293.70 297.84 A: go and rent an apartment or someplace off campus 

298.24 300.93 B: how many years have you been with your roommates 

300.94 302.09 A: um 

302.26 305.98 A: i'm i'm with all these people for the first time 

305.77 308.32 B: okay are you still getting along with them 

308.66 309.84 A: um 

310.33 316.65 A: [noise] [lipsmack] my roommate and i are pretty different i'm like i i'm from minnesota and i'm 

317.25 327.36 A: [noise] very very very liberal and of course he's from georgia and he's pretty conservative but so are are most of the people in my hall 

327.45 332.45 A: but um generally speaking i get along with 

332.53 342.78 A: [noise] the majority of the well yeah everybody in my section i get along with and there are of course those people that you get along with better and those that you don't 

342.92 346.30 A: are you still living in on campus housing [noise] [noise] 

346.09 351.47 B: no i live off campus i live with six other girls that 

352.58 355.58 B: freshman year one of then actually was my roommate 

356.46 357.28 B: so 

357.31 360.09 B: um which is weird because when we were in the same room 

360.33 362.74 B: (( we really didn't get along but )) 

363.14 368.29 B: the year after like we were pretty much best friends once we had our space 

368.64 372.19 B: and it's interesting it'll be interesting to see 

372.62 373.59 B: like 

373.90 375.43 B: if we're still close after 

377.55 384.67 B: was their last year and i guess as in like living with your family you need space from them 

384.85 390.43 B: and you're not as close any more after being in close spaces so 

391.04 396.94 B: they all get along but i think that our new house is a better fit for each other 'cause we're all pretty 

397.07 401.54 B: relaxed and we have the same schedule and we like to do the same stuff 

402.33 404.43 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] what are you majoring in

490.84 495.26 B: so i used to want to be an engineer but at the last second i decided
