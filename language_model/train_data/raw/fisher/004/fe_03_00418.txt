202.74 204.94 B: well i grew up in the episcopal church which is 

205.12 208.01 B: quite a lot different from the church of god i think but maybe not

238.46 240.87 B: well there's a church of god right around the corner 

241.35 241.90 B: from me 

243.23 244.37 B: and they're very active 

245.66 246.71 B: and they're always out 

247.28 248.96 B: sweeping the parking lot and 

249.79 253.85 B: carrying furniture around and doing all that community service stuff 

253.26 254.17 A: oh that's good

257.48 258.96 A: people in your church like family 

259.35 259.88 A: or do you 

260.15 261.26 B: ah no i don't 

262.23 263.32 B: excuse me 

263.74 265.11 A: because when my dad died 

265.69 268.72 A: i had friends in connecticut that i haven't even um 

269.61 270.92 A: seen for a while 

271.10 274.73 A: and several of them called me several times it was like they're still

276.32 277.62 B: oh yes 

279.18 280.13 A: and we just 

280.83 283.62 A: yeah it's like it's like having other sisters and brothers 

284.26 286.13 A: and i was going to say in central america 

286.49 288.16 A: everybody calls me sister ellen 

288.46 288.77 B: yeah

292.24 293.61 A: respond the same way 

294.61 303.32 A: because they i mean they want to know that that i'm a part of their family too so i have to remember to say sister rosalinda or brother byron 

299.15 299.74 B: sure 

304.15 304.47 A: and it 

304.60 305.04 A: it was

317.25 318.82 A: they call each other sister and brother
