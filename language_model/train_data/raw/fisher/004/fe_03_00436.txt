2.45 3.09 B: hi 

3.54 4.05 A: hi 

4.98 6.13 A: um this is kelly 

6.52 7.33 B: this is donna 

7.69 8.10 A: hi 

8.47 8.93 B: hi 

9.05 9.69 A: hi 

10.33 12.43 A: uh so we're suppose to talk about 

13.27 13.76 A: um 

13.87 14.47 B: corporate 

13.98 15.87 A: corporate conduct in america 

15.88 17.44 B: yeah is this your first one 

17.62 18.45 A: yes 

18.05 20.86 B: mine too so they must have just started this 

18.74 20.13 A: yeah 

20.60 24.56 A: yes i just signed up actually my husband signed me up last night 

24.65 32.32 B: mhm well i don't think the only way it affects us really is i guess um stocks and markets and stuff like that 

25.38 25.65 A: so 

33.37 33.92 B: (( )) 

34.12 36.00 B: that's just dropping dropping 

36.35 36.90 A: mhm 

37.15 37.66 A: yeah 

38.00 38.45 A: yeah 

39.26 40.59 A: i don't really 

41.43 45.11 A: um know much actually about the corporate climate in america 

45.73 48.98 A: um stop laughing at me uh 

47.50 50.74 B: well i know like the big shots are ripping off everybody 

50.57 53.48 A: yes yes that's what you here time and again 

51.06 52.04 B: the big 

53.22 56.44 B: yeah and i think they should go to jail for that stuff 

56.55 57.24 A: oh well 

57.34 58.37 A: that would be nice but it 

58.76 66.01 A: will probably never happen i would think they were the ones funding all the people who make the laws correct so 

64.84 68.51 B: probably but that's things that should be changed 

66.14 69.81 A: therefore well yeah wouldn't that be nice 

69.98 72.64 B: but how do we change them is the problem right 

70.19 70.72 A: that'll 

72.57 73.09 A: (( you're right )) 

73.20 73.66 A: (( yeah )) 

73.63 74.25 B: (( )) 

73.80 74.48 A: right 

74.84 75.14 A: so 

75.31 75.78 B: yeah 

75.94 78.20 B: i forgot what else he said 

78.10 78.62 A: pardon 

78.71 81.01 B: i forgot what else he said the questions 

81.04 84.42 A: he just uh gosh what else did he say oh has it affected you 

84.70 87.35 B: oh well just in like the stocks and 

88.67 92.63 B: (( )) (( i._r._a.'s )) and you know all that kind of stuff 

88.86 89.52 A: yeah 

93.41 96.24 A: but i think another one of the questions was whether or not um 

97.33 99.19 A: you think the 

99.35 103.90 A: uh the way that they're behaving is affecting the stocks or if 

104.18 105.60 A: it's just happening 

106.31 106.88 A: and 

107.33 108.12 A: you know what i mean 

108.33 110.03 A: if it's a cause and effect sort of thing 

108.43 108.99 B: mhm 

110.58 112.82 B: yeah well i i think it is 

112.77 113.34 A: oh really 

113.69 115.38 B: it's part of it it's got to be 

115.53 117.56 A: oh i just figure uh 

118.86 121.68 A: it was probably going to go down anyhow that's what i think 

121.59 122.13 B: you do 

122.46 123.57 A: yeah because um 

124.08 124.66 A: i 

125.14 131.14 A: this is what i think i could be completely wrong here but i think the big huge drop in stocks 

131.47 135.03 A: and stuff like that is probably caused by all the people who have (( the money )) 

135.44 137.59 A: because just like normal people who invest 

138.06 139.60 A: don't have that much effect 

139.77 143.17 A: it's the big players who have the most effect and they're also the ones who are breaking the laws 

144.20 145.39 A: so 

146.09 151.71 B: right yeah that's affecting everybody i mean it's even if you only have a little in there they are taking it 

146.22 147.13 A: you know 

148.71 151.60 A: oh it's definitely affecting everyone mhm 

151.90 154.40 A: oh yes it's affecting everyone 

151.99 153.32 B: you know 

153.81 157.29 B: and social security for people you know 

157.46 160.43 B: i don't know kind of ripping everybody i guess 

160.36 161.60 A: yes they are 

161.64 164.72 B: but i i don't know how anybody would change anything 

164.79 167.74 A: yes i d- i was supposed to talk about how they would change it 

168.18 169.26 B: i don't know 

169.67 174.30 B: eh they say the questions kind of fast and i gu- i guess (( )) write them down 

169.78 170.69 A: (( )) 

174.43 177.88 B: but then you probably wouldn't have time to write them down either 

174.72 175.82 A: uh-huh yeah 

177.24 177.94 A: yeah they 

178.37 179.12 A: yeah 

178.37 182.10 B: it's kind of hard (( the )) first one anyway i think don't you 

180.37 181.35 A: mhm 

181.46 182.97 A: well yes 

182.25 184.14 B: it's like you don't really know what to say 

184.19 184.80 A: yeah 

184.37 186.20 B: so i don't know 

186.27 188.07 A: i don't know i don't really have a 

188.20 188.63 A: (( )) 

188.86 193.24 A: you know i don't really follow it that much in the papers or anything so i really only have my 

193.96 197.07 A: opinions and i don't really have any facts to base anything up on 

197.81 198.29 A: you know 

211.56 214.57 B: stuff like that and i kind of watch the stock market 

215.85 216.50 B: i don't know 

216.96 218.23 A: i don't even really follow that 

218.52 219.31 B: oh 

219.84 222.48 B: yeah (( i )) i watch for that but 

223.44 226.25 B: i don't know they're still dropping so 

226.47 227.22 B: i don't know 

226.60 226.99 A: oh 

227.24 228.29 A: well that's not good 

228.26 229.11 B: no 

229.26 235.06 B: they might go up a little bit one day and then the next day they go way back down again and up and down but they're going nowhere 

235.61 236.14 A: wow 

236.07 238.70 B: never get back to where they were i don't think 

239.44 239.96 A: yeah it was 

240.42 244.23 A: really high a couple years ago or (( about )) year and a half ago or something and then th- 

242.70 243.44 B: yeah 

245.14 246.48 A: all took a nose dive 

246.57 251.54 B: mhm yeah i suppose with the war- if it starts war and stuff it will go down more yet 

251.36 254.75 A: good lord yeah i d- i don't know i have always heard that um 

255.44 259.96 A: the quote unquote war machine is good for the economy so i don't know what would happen to stocks if 

260.04 260.55 B: hm 

260.53 261.37 A: it went to war 

262.18 262.70 A: um 

263.31 266.39 A: yeah i don't know i mean i don't if it's good for the economy 

266.71 272.10 A: if that is actually true that war is good for the economy then i would imagine maybe the stocks would go up eventually 

272.87 274.26 A: although i don't see how i mean 

274.77 275.24 A: i don't know 

275.83 280.62 A: if we were at war i would be pretty nervous i wouldn't be investing my money all over the place 

288.82 291.83 A: yeah you know you always here about that 

292.67 297.54 A: yeah well that's what that's what i was saying i don't know how that works they alwa- that's what they say 

297.89 300.88 A: yeah you go to history class blah blah blah war is great for the economy 

301.38 301.89 B: mhm 

301.41 302.86 A: oh really okay well 

303.22 304.52 A: i'm not exactly sure 

305.21 307.97 A: what you know you just always hear that or at least i always did 

308.16 315.52 B: yeah history isn't my strong suit i i like math and stuff i don't like history too much 

314.99 317.85 A: oh yes well that's what they always 

315.87 316.39 B: right 

318.00 319.08 A: said anyhow but it 

319.21 323.93 A: i don't know if it's really good for the regular people maybe it's good for all the big shots or something 

324.02 325.23 B: what state are you from 

325.42 326.35 A: (( i'm )) wisconsin 

326.51 327.21 B: oh so am i

333.18 335.64 A: oh oh you're a bit further north then 

334.84 340.28 B: i thought maybe they would pick somebody from one (( state )) and one from another so huh never know. 

340.20 341.93 A: yes yes (( )) 

341.18 341.97 B: yeah 

342.05 344.00 A: i guess they're (( )) well this is the

350.72 352.49 A: yes i guess that was the problem 

351.44 353.83 B: so i suppose being new it's kind of hard 

354.58 356.64 A: yeah i suppose i don't know 

356.38 365.14 B: i don't know how it works either but anyway i don't know we are supposed to talk for ten minutes i don't know what to even else to talk about because

416.01 417.81 A: yeah that will that would be nice i- 

418.20 422.44 B: but all they'll do is they'll get somebody else in and they'll rip people off too probably

514.49 515.57 B: yeah right 

517.70 518.25 B: um 

518.60 520.69 B: on the site on the computer
