47.82 49.63 A: in your cl- in your classroom 

48.83 49.48 B: (( uh-huh )) 

49.80 50.64 B: we 

50.09 51.91 A: in in in what way 

51.18 59.99 B: um we use like it's well we call it an elmo i don't know what else it's called but you know you hook it to the computer and it projects onto a screen whatever's on your p._c. 

60.07 62.13 A: okay okay it's called an elmo 

60.46 61.60 B: so 

61.87 66.09 B: yeah that's what we call i'm i'm that's what kind we have we call it the elmo so 

65.79 67.93 A: (( okay [laughter] all right )) 

66.27 77.23 B: [laughter] yeah and um [lipsmack] yeah we use that to like get websites off the computer that we can use with the kids and so we can do stuff you know on the big screen for then to see it 

75.59 76.46 A: right 

76.49 78.78 A: right and do they do the 

78.81 83.29 A: so do the kids use the computer at all or do you run the whole thing 

81.94 87.16 B: w- um when stuff like that i will just do it because i'm afraid of what they'll tap into 

87.13 88.46 A: yeah yeah 

87.41 93.20 B: you know god forbid they type in the wrong letter or the wrong space somewhere and who knows what will pop up 

91.11 92.09 A: yeah 

92.72 95.57 A: yeah sure no that's true that's true 

94.11 97.30 B: but yeah for the most part it's just me doing those things 

97.71 99.07 A: do they do they s- 

99.49 104.38 A: do you think they use computers at home and and feel comfortable using a computer at home 

103.87 107.44 B: [mn] um i come from a very rural school 

107.56 109.40 A: okay where where are you 

107.59 108.90 B: so i don't think a lot 

109.07 112.61 B: um from maryland yeah so 

109.48 110.63 A: (( where are you now )) 

111.40 112.39 A: okay 

112.56 125.09 B: they ah not a lot of the kids at my school don't have a lot computers at home but um but i mean they to it really fast so i think it's something really easy for them to learn and once you show 'em how to do it that's it that's all they need 

116.29 117.58 A: right right 

122.27 123.21 A: yeah 

125.16 126.16 A: right 

125.33 129.15 B: 'cause you know working on the computers is sort of enough for them to get doing stuff i 

129.38 135.72 A: yeah yeah i guess the i i'm trying to think how it could harm education 

135.03 136.44 B: (( don't know i mean )) 

135.74 141.71 A: i mean well i mean the only thing is that that i would think of would be that um 

137.45 138.01 B: (( [mn] )) 

141.98 144.66 A: using the internet for research 

143.61 144.78 B: yeah 

144.76 150.07 A: um you know my my girlfriend she teaches as well and she teaches ah 

150.93 153.22 A: [lipsmack] she teaches high school biology 

152.71 153.91 B: (( mm )) 

153.77 156.52 A: and she's amazed at how much 

156.83 160.12 A: information they get off of the internet 

159.39 160.56 B: yeah 

160.54 169.06 A: so much so that she now is thinking about actually limiting the amount of citations they actually use from the internet i 

168.49 171.96 B: yeah plus you don't know if they're coming from a reputable 

169.59 170.88 A: mean because they don't 

171.65 180.10 A: well you know exactly you don't know if they're if the information is yeah you're right is is accurate if it's good information and where it's coming from 

179.99 190.11 A: um not to mention the fact that you know people need to be able to go to the library and look some- you know and look up research and find research you know out of a 

188.66 189.75 B: mhm 

190.18 196.15 A: out of a book or out of a journal so i mean i'm thinking trying to think of where using a computer might 

196.50 200.76 A: you know might be a detriment to education and that really is the one thing that i could 

200.40 201.54 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

200.88 202.75 A: that i could actually think of 

202.13 208.14 B: that and and being able to get into sites that you shouldn't [laughter] would be the big problem 

205.98 207.57 A: (( yeah yeah yeah yeah )) 

208.13 210.21 A: yeah has that 

208.84 218.09 B: 'cause i know at our school we have a computer lab and they had to to make sure that kids were only going typing in exactly what like in fourth and fifth grade the older grades 

217.60 219.27 A: sure sure 

218.13 223.23 B: 'cause you see some of them were surfing other [laughter] things even at that age 

221.93 227.00 A: do they any do they have any kind of filters or anything on those computers 

224.85 232.31 B: not that i'm aware of i mean i've i'm on the internet at school and i've never you know encountered anything where i couldn't get to a site or 

232.10 233.04 A: right 

232.46 236.34 B: you know but then again i haven't gone to any like really horrible things so 

233.44 234.21 A: right 

235.11 237.86 A: exactly yeah really 

236.75 239.66 B: maybe i need to try one of those on time but [laughter] 

239.53 245.92 A: well i know that ah ah where melinda teaches that they have a you know they have a they do have a filter 

245.82 246.97 B: mhm 

246.03 247.72 A: for for you know 

248.65 251.97 A: a lot you know a lot of different kinds of websites but ah 

252.16 255.60 A: you know at penn that's certainly not the case but ah 

256.00 258.88 A: they definitely they definitely do that where she works 

258.28 259.56 B: (( yeah they )) 

259.26 273.92 A: you know and our students i mean that's all they ever do is i mean everything in on the computer we even now have a have a system which i've just started using recently called web cafe and web cafe is um 

263.65 264.69 B: mhm 

274.76 276.20 A: it's almost like a 

277.23 280.50 A: offline or not really offline but it's a place where 

280.76 281.59 A: (( ah )) 

281.46 286.97 A: you know you just you can store all of your papers i mean we keep everything the syllabus the 

284.92 286.02 B: oh 

286.81 296.84 A: you know all the papers that students turn in they don't if they don't want to they don't have to turn in a hard copy to the to the professor they can just drop it in this little you know they go online 

296.80 304.74 A: copy it from their from their computer and just paste it into a folder yeah yeah it's i know well i it's it's ah 

296.87 299.28 B: (( oh they just put it in the folder or something )) 

300.07 302.92 B: (( oh my god i'd never had that in either of my [laughter] )) 

304.54 313.65 A: relatively new um on campus and it is amazing how functional it is because not only can you put um 

313.74 324.08 A: you know all of the documents that you need for the class syllabus you can always you can constantly update stuff and it'll send students notices when things are updated or changed there's also 

320.94 322.07 B: mhm 

324.11 334.34 A: ah an instructor folder and nobody can g- the only people that can get into the instructor folder are the people that actually set it up so the instructors themselves are the only people that have access so you can put 

334.30 340.78 A: quizzes tests um all of your grades and everything online and um 

340.81 342.08 A: you know you can 

342.40 343.88 A: keep everything there 

343.96 348.13 A: and you can access it anywhere it doesn't matter wherever there's an internet connection you can 

347.66 348.82 B: yeah 

348.39 350.30 A: access the web cafe 

350.03 353.20 B: see that's the gr- that's the good thing it does you know [laughter] for 

352.67 357.55 A: yeah i know exactly it definitely i mean i think that it's 

353.41 354.68 B: for education 

357.80 359.60 A: it's not like it's going away 

358.75 367.90 B: no i think you have to deal with the bad because it's inevitable i mean i have to that's just the way things are going it's only going to get more and more and more [laughter] 

359.62 360.92 A: and 

363.11 364.16 A: yeah 

365.44 366.96 A: right how 

367.97 371.94 A: yeah sure sure and students are and kids are gonna become more 

372.04 377.87 A: more fluent and more ah computer savvy which they you know i mean they are already 

372.56 373.62 B: (( uh-huh )) 

377.19 378.24 B: oh yeah 

378.16 382.18 A: it's amazing what a generational difference i mean it's it's almost fel- ah it's 

380.01 381.05 B: uh-huh 

382.22 383.08 A: like 

383.21 390.89 A: computers you know became popular and everybody kn- learned about them but right before that there's that whole group of people that just have no clue 

389.98 391.21 B: oh yeah 

391.44 395.01 B: i mean i have a nephew who was two and he could turn you know 

391.57 392.43 A: (( you know )) 

394.90 409.64 B: go in to click start shut down you know he could do all that he couldn't even read but he knew because you know of the way everything's laid out so user friendly and his grandfather couldn't do it you know [laughter] like he'd have to him to shut down the computer you know two years old 

399.87 400.95 A: yeah 

405.87 407.39 A: yeah yeah 

408.92 417.20 A: well i do a i i volunteer teach computer training to adults and um 

417.27 425.26 A: it's here here in center city philadelphia and it's people who it's a lot of you know low income older adults 

421.40 422.44 B: mhm 

425.55 431.89 A: who really are trying to gain some computer skills just so they can get a job pretty much anywhere 

431.17 432.22 B: oh yeah 

432.10 436.04 A: and um it's amazing to the biggest hurdle 

436.21 444.50 A: of of anything it's not sitting down and you know typing and and you know turning a computer on it's using the mouse 

444.21 445.24 B: uh-huh 

445.23 447.73 A: there's this complete disconnect between 

447.89 449.75 A: holding the mouse 

449.83 454.99 A: you know in your hand and seeing it move on the screen 

454.36 455.97 B: yeah 

455.47 456.93 A: and they can not 

457.12 458.75 A: they can't ah 

459.67 464.38 A: it's it's such a hard jump for them for some reason i can't quite figure it out when we 

461.45 462.49 B: mhm 

463.31 469.20 B: you know it's kind of like the older you get the more i don't know it seems like the more child you become you know as far as 

468.61 471.65 A: perh- yeah like it's it's there's definitely 

469.46 478.76 B: and if you put a little kid on a computer they can't understand you know that where the arrow is pointing is where i'm moving the mouse it's kind of the same [laughter] guess when you get older 

476.22 477.37 A: right 

477.56 478.88 A: yeah 

478.95 481.76 A: yeah so it's it's ah 

482.15 484.26 A: you know and it's interesting because 

484.92 488.98 A: now with kids there isn't a single kid that i could think of who 

489.32 496.80 A: doesn't really feel comfortable sitting in front of a computer and they learned it they learned it somewhere you know they learned it from 

492.58 493.57 B: mhm 

494.36 497.16 B: yeah well they'll just try it they don't have the fear 

497.27 501.03 B: i mean they're not afraid to break things and to mess it up [laughter] you know 

497.47 498.25 A: right 

498.30 499.40 A: right 

500.76 510.40 A: ri- right where with adult learners sitting down and never having used a computer before it's it's a it's incredibly intimidating to them 

504.58 505.54 B: yeah 

508.76 513.24 B: mhm you're so worried about doing the right thing you don't want to mess it up or break it or 

512.80 515.36 A: they're they think that they're gonna break the computer 

513.28 514.20 B: (( yeah )) 

514.32 516.21 B: yeah click on the wrong thing 

516.73 518.25 A: yeah 

518.26 520.54 A: definitely so how long you been in teaching 

520.07 522.02 B: um this is my third year 

522.24 523.37 A: oh really 

522.61 523.51 B: mhm 

523.46 527.44 A: wow and have you always been teaching at at that school that same school 

526.59 528.03 B: yeah mhm 

527.71 534.58 A: yeah and it's a a rural school in maryland you said yeah okay 

528.34 529.17 B: (( yeah )) 

532.20 533.07 B: yeah 

533.93 535.74 B: yep so 

535.23 537.40 A: and that's where you're are you from that area 

536.77 538.10 B: yeah uh-huh 

537.91 539.66 A: oh okay okay 

539.21 542.67 B: well a little farther away from it [laughter] not quite [laughter] 

541.47 542.33 A: yeah 

542.55 544.15 A: but in the area at least 

542.96 546.57 B: yeah my little city is considered a big city to them so 

546.60 548.13 A: okay [laughter] 

546.87 549.27 B: yeah it's kind of one of those things 

549.32 550.93 A: right right 

549.74 551.40 B: but yeah 

551.93 556.74 B: so we don't have very many parents involved in technology [laughter] no [laughter] 

555.24 557.40 A: no yeah 

556.83 557.84 B: no 

558.42 563.91 A: yeah interesting very interesting well i think we've spoken for at least ten minutes haven't we 

559.68 560.67 B: no 

563.34 568.73 B: i think it's ah okay thought i heard something [laughter] i think it's supposed to come on and tell us 

568.66 570.20 A: and tell us okay 

569.02 573.72 B: yeah but at least 'cause i i had done i've only done one other one of these before 

572.97 575.74 A: oh you have done one other oh okay what 

573.88 578.19 B: yeah but it was really bad so [laughter] i don't 'cause i just 

577.47 578.63 A: was your 

578.69 580.26 A: what was your experience 

579.32 592.67 B: um we were talking about marriage or family values i guess and we only talked for like a minute and then he just said okay you know see you later and i said okay bye and then i hung up and i thought well that's odd 'cause i know we're supposed to do it for ten minutes 

584.16 585.32 A: oh goodness 

592.55 593.77 A: yeah 

592.83 599.95 B: yeah and then i talked to a lady i work with at school who actually is the wife of someone indirectly involved with the study some-
