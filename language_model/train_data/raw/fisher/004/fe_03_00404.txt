0.45 1.60 B: hi 

2.17 3.09 B: hello 

2.40 3.67 A: hello 

3.54 5.95 B: (( hi ah this is ah chrisu )) 

6.11 8.17 A: yes ah my name's kevin 

8.03 9.93 B: ah hi how are you 

9.73 11.05 A: very good 

10.46 14.72 B: ah so we are supposed to talk about education 

14.44 20.89 A: yeah computers whether they make [sigh] whether they're good for education or bad i guess 

20.74 23.52 B: um why bad 

24.46 25.73 A: what's that 

25.14 27.78 B: ah why specifically bad 

27.27 34.05 A: well i don't know that what i'm saying ah i think the thing is ah do they help or hinder education 

34.67 35.70 B: um 

36.44 44.68 B: i guess if they are used as just a distraction i would say yeah they they are a problem for education but ah there is one issue in that i think they 

44.70 50.21 B: prevent people from actually reading more books that's one of the things that i i notice 

51.28 52.99 A: ah and i would agree they 

53.14 59.39 A: do tend to be a distracter from more mainstream type things um 

60.68 62.20 A: and you know 

62.24 63.54 A: as far as 

64.02 68.28 A: i mean i don't know how far they want to go on the computer topic however 

68.45 74.49 A: i would say that if you're looking at the computer using the internet for research 

74.76 78.97 A: ah for something you don't really know 

78.93 91.27 A: the validity of a website um because there isn't anything that where anyone has to check or double check the information put on a website whereas if you were to 

91.91 99.45 A: get information from a a book you know the editor of the book or whoever has double checked the information 

99.50 110.66 B: um yeah i mean but depending on the kind of information you were looking for there are sources of information that ah are more or less official on on the internet 

110.65 119.20 B: so you depending on whether the person prefer looking for information on um medicine for example you have number of sites that are 

119.22 126.63 B: um maintained by organizations that are professional organizations so you go look for information there i 

126.72 132.59 B: i think it's the same with books i mean you go to the library depending on what you're looking for you might not 

132.61 141.76 B: find a source that would be ah believable in many respects um i guess that that risk also exists in with this 

141.84 156.29 B: ah the point is that on the internet you have way more information than we can handling a lot of information that ah is not identified as having a specific source so that that's i guess that's complicates 

155.67 160.36 A: yeah yeah it complicates when there is no providence for it ah 

160.46 169.12 A: the other thing with computers that are helpful in one respect ah say in completing a paper 

169.27 171.87 A: your computers obviously help you 

172.05 183.20 A: ah to correct spelling and grammer ah problems however that ha- that's a double edged sword in that ah 

184.70 191.60 A: having that that computer do the spelling check the spelling and check some of the grammer for you 

191.95 193.01 A: people 

193.29 201.89 A: it seems now have a lot harder time doing that themselves nobody seems to know gee how's that really spelt 

203.04 212.14 B: um i yeah i don't really know i mean i don't know about any specific issues where it should that people might mention i i i think 

212.19 223.28 B: even for people who are not like don't even know how to use a spell checker ah on a computer i think they they show the same kind of problems with respect to spell- especially in english 

216.42 217.32 A: mhm 

223.16 229.13 B: in which there are so many problems with vowels for example and the way they are spelt i i guess 

226.37 227.28 A: right 

229.67 240.10 B: i i i i wouldn't give up on the idea that we have something automatic because it's actu- in the end it's actually boring to check for spelling on the text or anything like this 

240.20 250.68 B: um and i guess some people just don't don't care about such issues i mean if they know it they they do but if they don't they just don't don't pay so much attention to this 

250.46 257.89 A: [mn] and you may have a very point it may not be the fault of the the technology it may be 

258.11 269.15 A: [laughter] the fault of the desire of the people involved the desire to do it correctly or or the desire just to [sigh] not care about it you know 

267.55 268.45 B: (( i )) 

269.06 277.39 B: um yeah i i guess i mean like there's people people who deal with publications for example many times people who write papers for example 

277.40 278.63 B: they just 

278.64 278.99 B: (( ah )) 

279.00 293.98 B: don't even care so much about this 'cause they say oh there is going to be someone who's gonna be the ah gonna be the copy editing and they're gonna find ah problems like this so it's not something that i should worry about and they actually catch a lot of these things in the end 

293.38 295.69 A: yeah that's probably true ah [mn] 

296.14 303.11 A: you know i don't know ah a lot of other issues that are regarding to computers regarding computers in education 

303.19 304.66 A: other than ah 

305.94 310.26 A: you know how how they're i guess they could be used more in ah 

310.43 312.77 A: some sort of research um 

314.15 324.75 A: ah you know used as data compilers but ah i don't really know anything about that um have you had any experience with ah computers in education [noise] 

324.97 339.35 B: oh well i mean basically i i i people don't especially if you are college education it's impossible to d- do anything without the computer nowadays especially because many of the things have been over the the internet 

339.40 347.88 B: so you exchange a lot of information with students and materials and it's just impossible not to rely on the computer 

347.99 354.06 B: um and i think people are moving more and more in this direction so for example 

353.98 361.85 B: many classes are taught nowadays with ah all the material being made available on the internet 

361.76 371.95 B: ah so it's not usually the case that we'd bring printouts to classes anymore because many things are just made available to the students and they just go and check 

372.66 381.46 B: so they don't for example homework many people are actually moving in the direction of having assignments made available on the web they don't grade them 

381.63 390.97 B: the students just have to do them and then they go and check the the the answers for the assignments if the if it is just homework 

382.27 383.23 A: wow all 

391.42 400.88 B: ah but i mean it's just gonna be a matter of time before people actually um just accept the idea that we shouldn't be 

400.81 415.54 B: ah checking on what students are doing all the time the people should give them more responsibility in that well they want to learn and if they want to do that it's it doesn't make much sense to be checking on whether they are doing their work or not 

415.64 420.33 A: right either if if they want to learn they'll work towards it 

417.28 419.68 B: (( yeah )) 

420.37 422.98 A: and if they don't want to learn then they won't 

423.30 425.13 A: then they won't learn it 

424.42 435.23 B: well i mean there are going to be there are there are ah thresholds right they have to to pass certain ah ah they have to satisfy certain requirements so 

435.21 445.09 B: it doesn't mean that because they don't need to be graded on their assignment they are not going to be graded at all so in the end they have to take an exam they have to write the final paper 

445.21 451.23 B: ah things that i mean at some point throughout the course a whole semester course 

451.27 460.60 B: they are going to be tested on how much they have learned and ah that's when we actually know whether the students are actually doing their work on a regular basis or not 

459.97 464.43 A: [lipsmack] and that makes more sense ah obviously at some point 

461.92 463.71 B: (( yeah )) 

464.56 470.03 A: you know ah the school isn't as responsible maybe as the 

470.06 479.43 A: or the college university isn't as responsible as the student is about ah attempting to learn the information i 

477.01 478.38 B: exactly 

480.42 485.11 A: you know this whole conversation comes back around to ah 

485.24 495.87 A: the computers again once again it's i i think that computers can be very useful for education if they are 

496.24 499.85 A: you know if they're exploited properly and not 

500.42 505.01 A: not abused i mean obviously any type of research you know like i said earlier 

505.13 508.43 A: you know there are websites that don't have the right ah 

508.62 523.33 A: providence and may be putting out bad info but like you pointed out there are there are books that have the same problem you can print just about anything so it comes down to you know verifying your sources one way or another 

524.35 525.39 B: yes 

525.66 539.94 B: um i mean but now with respect to the the computers that's just using the computers in general i mean there are things nowadays that we can't even do without the computer in terms of like education they are not used just as support 

539.62 540.91 A: right 

540.58 551.90 B: they are actually ah the main tool to to do a lot of things in many in many fields so people are actually moving in the direction of not being able to do their work 

551.91 562.69 B: efficiently without the computer at all i mean if you're talking about people who like are writers or like philosophers ah historians people who actually rely 

562.77 565.61 B: on print material a lot 

565.81 577.14 B: it may not be such an issue because in the end they're gonna use computers for maybe ah word processing in many respects but in other fields in which we should need to do experimental work 

577.28 582.90 B: like lab work it's just impossible for people to do much without the computer 

578.47 580.39 A: right 

582.54 584.19 A: mm because they can 

584.54 591.81 A: they can process the data that a human being just can't can't do 

591.55 599.89 B: yeah but i mean actu- actually the data collection itself ah is many things are now made through computers so it's not
