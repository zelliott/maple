0.75 1.24 A: hello 

1.49 2.77 B: hi 

2.19 3.47 A: hi my name's jennifer 

3.39 4.53 B: hi my name's kim 

4.61 10.34 A: um i guess um when do you want to what do you want to start with 

10.39 17.11 B: um well let's see actually i think computers i work in the i._t. industry and i think that 

17.35 19.49 B: computers are great in the uh 

20.13 21.09 B: education 

21.19 21.87 B: field 

21.84 24.30 A: i happen to agree um 

24.85 27.57 A: let me think what d- what do you think like what 

28.20 34.60 A: area do you think they are most beneficial to like math or geography or anything in particular 

34.70 38.36 B: um well probably anything i mean 

38.72 41.85 B: history you know with google you can 

42.16 42.69 A: mhm 

42.29 46.70 B: research pretty much anything you want to 

44.90 45.46 A: mhm 

47.36 53.09 B: i would say history or geography any of those math um 

53.33 55.40 B: i'm not really so sure 

55.16 55.87 A: yeah 

56.19 58.81 A: other than like games or something like that or 

59.01 60.13 B: right exactly 

59.44 62.66 A: problems they can do on the computer um now 

62.96 64.97 A: are you talking about like um 

65.47 67.31 A: like college education as well 

67.64 72.72 B: yeah yeah i think high school or college either one i mean i think 

68.59 69.48 A: yeah me too 

73.06 76.24 B: mostly um the colleges (( use )) 

76.65 77.59 B: have 

78.30 78.69 B: uh 

79.02 80.03 B: computer 

80.20 83.25 B: lab in almost every classroom now so 

82.87 84.05 A: mhm mhm 

84.93 87.54 A: yeah i agree i think i think computers are very 

88.21 88.83 A: um 

98.96 103.85 A: um you know a lot of the kids fool around and stuff so like i'm not so sure if like 

104.11 106.11 A: lower elementary schools like they're that 

106.50 109.72 A: as useful as with um high school and college 

110.77 112.70 B: yeah i think so too um 

110.89 111.98 A: but um 

115.00 115.55 B: but i 

115.82 116.93 B: i don't know when 

117.23 120.34 B: i was in elementary school it was pretty much apple computers 

120.15 121.32 A: yeah oh yeah 

120.65 130.78 B: so it's like what did you do with those and now i mean i have a friend who has a five year old and 

123.83 125.48 A: yeah that's true 

131.22 136.35 B: he is into computer games like i'm going five years old but 

133.96 134.51 A: mhm 

136.69 138.39 B: he is learning 

138.41 138.96 A: mhm 

138.56 142.54 B: you know and he's only five and knows how to use the computer and loves it so i think 

141.79 142.49 A: yeah 

142.67 146.49 B: i think elementary school it's helpful too because they have 

146.62 149.74 B: the um learn how to read and the 

149.85 154.28 B: math games and everything they're games but they're educational so 

152.66 153.29 A: mhm 

153.67 162.63 A: yeah i guess i guess that makes more sense like the the programs are more specialized that they can use and more accessible to younger children 

162.43 165.54 B: exactly it's not oregon trail or anything 

165.05 167.66 A: yeah yeah 

166.74 167.65 B: so 

168.34 169.12 A: (( i don't know i guess )) 

168.72 169.01 B: that's 

169.24 170.87 B: that's what i think i don't 

170.24 171.02 A: yeah 

171.43 173.37 B: i don't know do we do we have a time limit 

173.36 179.71 A: i don't know i thought it wa- i thought the time limit was like ten minutes but 

179.26 180.33 B: oh really 

180.04 183.65 A: i've uh a i can't imagine like some of the topics i can't imagine talking for that long 

183.68 184.35 B: no 

184.78 185.43 A: um 

185.21 185.83 B: um 

186.20 188.16 B: do we stay on or do we hang up or 

188.74 189.99 A: oh i don't know 

190.67 192.53 A: i this is my first one i've done 

190.73 191.18 B: (( i mean )) 

192.31 192.91 B: me too 

193.90 198.69 B: yeah me too but i mean i guess we have to i don't really know much 

198.92 200.20 B: else to say about 

200.00 200.48 A: yeah 

200.59 201.31 B: them just 

201.51 205.95 A: well um maybe we can talk about like the internet specifically like 

206.24 208.49 A: for a minute 

208.04 210.31 B: (( )) well i'm a huge fan of google 

210.45 214.21 A: yeah i am too i'm using it right now actually 

212.67 213.29 B: yeah 

213.51 220.26 B: i mean and plus email students can well a lot of the high schools i think especially are 

220.37 221.76 B: putting up um 

223.46 231.76 B: homework on on web sites and homework help and things like that that's really helpful too and email you can email your teacher if 

229.04 229.60 A: mhm 

231.01 231.66 A: mhm 

232.03 234.22 B: help i think that's pretty 

234.40 235.15 B: useful 

234.47 238.58 A: yeah i agree i think that um especially emailing 

238.89 244.14 A: oh i don't know if it should be necessarily available like in school on the school computers um 

244.61 247.01 B: for kids to email yeah 

244.77 246.61 A: all the ti- on all of them 

252.76 253.88 A: kids would feel more 

254.24 256.69 A: comfortable asking questions in class or 

257.07 260.82 A: especially in college like you know i only see my professors every 

261.45 265.66 A: every other day or so and it's it's really helpful to be able to have that contact with them 

265.86 267.03 B: right exactly 

266.89 268.16 A: so 

268.38 269.30 A: um 

269.79 271.19 A: yeah i think that's how i 

271.61 274.37 A: that's what i think about that so 

274.14 275.73 B: um 

277.47 278.72 B: (( try to )) think what else 

280.50 281.06 B: (( )) 

281.77 283.10 A: um l- 

283.23 284.31 A: let's see i 

285.38 286.18 A: do 

285.52 289.56 B: google and internet let's see email 

290.80 297.02 A: um what about let's see i don't know how your school systems are wherever you're from but 

297.16 298.49 A: um i know 

298.69 301.83 A: i grew up in souther minnesota and 

302.05 306.20 A: our school system like they would spend lots of money on 

306.69 310.85 A: getting computers and like making their technology 

311.17 313.26 A: you know upgrading or whatever 

313.46 320.46 A: but yet they were cutting programs like their art programs and their music programs do you feel that like 

318.30 318.73 B: yeah 

321.34 322.50 A: that kind of 

322.19 323.19 B: you said 

322.96 328.41 A: sacrifice you know like one over the other like it's worth it or i don't know just like your opinion 

328.15 329.17 B: well 

329.60 332.02 B: you know i think that 

332.60 336.88 B: computers the computer industry in general is where the jobs are at 

336.83 337.41 A: mhm 

337.15 340.24 B: so i don't necessarily think it's a good thing 

340.29 340.88 A: mhm 

340.38 341.76 B: to take 

341.85 345.45 B: art and music and those type of things away but 

345.58 348.52 B: it i think it helps kids in the long run 

348.77 353.49 A: right cause they're it's more like real world experience they'll have experience (( )) 

353.10 354.25 B: exactly 

353.78 356.41 A: computers and won't be left behind and stuff 

355.99 358.95 B: exactly i mean i um 

359.68 369.37 B: my sister just graduated from high school not long ago and she they actually designed their own school's web site and everything they it was a class 

369.59 370.72 A: oh wow mhm 

370.26 374.64 B: and so i think that's really neat i mean she has the experience to go 

374.91 376.80 B: into front page and 

376.99 379.60 B: design a web page if she needs to 

379.43 380.27 A: mhm 

380.06 382.59 B: and otherwise i don't think she would have 

382.82 386.22 B: probably not done that unless it had of been 

386.60 391.20 B: something she had to do you know she wouldn't have taken that up on herself to do 

387.99 388.88 A: mhm 

391.13 391.72 A: mhm 

391.81 392.70 B: and so 

391.94 392.41 A: (( mhm )) 

393.66 395.70 B: i mean they get a lot of knowledge 

395.84 398.38 B: um you know if you go out 

398.88 399.45 B: into the 

399.72 404.96 B: the world to work after education you're going to have to know about computers 

404.71 405.33 A: yeah 

405.56 406.02 A: yeah 

406.20 407.58 B: because if you don't 

407.68 410.70 B: i mean even if you're flipping hamburgers at mcdonald's 

410.50 411.03 A: uh huh 

410.98 412.07 B: you know there are still 

412.70 419.23 B: computerized cash registers and wh- wh- whatever they're ordering system is so 

414.93 415.76 A: yeah 

418.78 419.33 A: mhm 

419.86 422.46 B: i think in the long run it's helped 

422.19 422.80 A: yeah 

423.52 424.60 A: yeah i agree 

425.44 428.31 A: i wish i didn't have to get those programs though 

428.87 429.56 B: (( oh the )) what 

429.48 432.67 A: i wish i didn't have to get those programs though all the time 

432.41 434.11 B: yeah yeah that's true 

432.84 435.57 A: but i i do understand like the 

435.97 437.55 A: the pay offs are good so 

438.38 441.01 B: yeah well unless you have some really gifted 

441.20 442.22 B: student who 

442.92 443.97 B: you know is 

444.13 446.78 B: an amazing artist or something that 

446.26 446.90 A: mhm 

447.15 449.56 B: they're going to suffer from it but 

449.72 450.35 A: yeah 

451.52 452.80 B: most of the time 

453.76 457.73 B: i don't know (( )) where i went to school we didn't have an art class 

457.88 460.29 B: anyway so 

457.97 458.45 A: mhm 

460.98 466.79 B: and we only had music in elementary unless it was band so actually our school didn't 

464.26 465.06 A: oh oh 

468.03 468.83 B: really 

469.39 472.52 B: suffer from losing anything for getting 

472.56 473.20 A: mhm 

473.20 473.95 B: (( )) 

474.11 477.93 B: the computer lab but you know we did um 

478.59 480.97 B: and i imagine this was probably a 

482.67 483.52 B: entire 

484.20 485.53 B: u._s. thing but the 

485.76 487.07 B: um blue 

487.24 488.83 B: pepsi bottle caps 

488.65 489.21 A: mhm 

489.14 490.87 B: do you remember that 

491.35 492.99 A: um what what about them 

492.96 493.43 B: (( well )) 

493.59 496.65 B: it was like five cents towards your school for computers 

496.93 497.81 B: for bottle caps 

497.94 501.30 A: oh i don't i don't think they did that in our school district 

500.89 505.51 B: really well we we had um 

501.66 502.43 A: yeah 

506.98 512.85 B: if you collected a blue bottle cap you got five cents to your school if you turn them in to your school 

511.31 512.05 A: oh 

512.58 513.07 A: uh huh 

513.22 514.21 B: and 

514.77 516.61 B: it actually ended up being this 

516.95 520.08 B: huge like competition between 

520.60 524.89 B: the grades in the high school to see who could get the most which was 

525.60 526.55 A: oh wow 

526.66 527.38 B: and we 

527.80 529.72 B: got a lot of 

529.91 536.77 B: computers with those bottle caps so that's kind of you know that's not really taking away 

532.01 532.97 A: oh yeah 

536.68 537.97 A: yeah it's just kind of 

537.14 538.02 B: (( )) 

538.16 547.52 B: it's you know you're raising the money and then i think maybe i'm not exactly for sure how it works but maybe the school match store the 

540.44 541.02 A: uh huh 

546.89 547.42 A: mhm 

547.65 549.26 B: we all of the computers 

549.38 554.93 B: that um they bought were gateways so maybe gateway had something 

554.94 555.90 A: yeah 

555.15 557.13 B: that they rigged it but 

556.19 556.94 A: yeah 

557.59 561.73 A: so but i think that's a good idea then you don't need to like take away from anything else 

561.91 565.65 B: yeah if you found the money somewhere else through donations and stuff 

562.51 563.22 A: and 

565.21 565.75 A: yeah 

566.26 567.58 A: well that's a really good idea 

568.99 569.66 B: should we just 

569.85 571.81 B: i don't know what to talk about anymore 

571.36 573.27 A: i don't either 

572.49 577.63 B: i don't know how long we have to stay on the phone it said that it was recorded but do they stop us
