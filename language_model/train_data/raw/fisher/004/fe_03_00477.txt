24.79 30.60 A: that's okay um i think we're supposed to first describe whether we'd rather eat at a restaurant or eat at home 

31.02 33.44 A: and if what our favorite meal is 

32.02 32.51 B: right 

32.80 34.77 B: what are my favorite meals okay you want to go first 

34.93 35.65 A: sure 

35.46 35.90 B: okay 

35.98 36.55 A: um 

36.92 38.80 A: well i don't know it's kind of a toss up 

39.26 43.08 A: sometimes i'd really like to eat in a restaurant and sometimes i'd really like to cook at home 

43.55 44.81 A: especially if i have a lot of time 

45.06 45.69 B: right 

45.68 49.81 A: if i don't have time and i've got you know i have to be somewhere quick 

45.82 46.79 B: (( )) 

47.09 48.03 B: (( )) 

50.16 51.81 A: sometimes it's easier just to eat out 

52.36 54.47 B: yeah and actually i i feel 

55.79 58.92 B: pretty close to the same way it's it's really hard sometimes with 

59.36 62.28 B: my three year old to go to a restaurant because he 

63.86 64.60 B: tolerates sitting 

64.75 65.45 B: very 

65.87 68.45 B: for very long periods of time and 

67.24 67.76 A: mhm 

68.62 69.66 B: eating at home is 

70.56 71.00 B: actually 

71.54 73.25 B: it's cheaper too and it 

73.04 74.56 A: sure it's a lot cheaper 

73.73 80.39 B: and that's another yeah and that's another issue i used to when i was married we ate out all the time and now that i'm single 

80.59 81.05 B: you just 

81.30 83.99 B: you learn to cut corners and that was one of the corners i 

84.25 85.61 A: well it just costs so much 

84.79 85.07 B: (( )) 

85.41 86.49 B: yeah yeah 

86.73 93.06 A: and we eat at home a lot mostly because um couple of other special dietary things 

93.54 96.09 A: and it's easier you know what you're fixing too 

96.09 96.40 B: right 

96.60 96.97 B: right 

96.99 100.80 A: because sometimes when you eat in a restaurant you don't know who has made it if it was even made there 

97.35 97.67 B: yeah 

99.33 100.12 B: i know 

100.91 101.31 B: yeah 

101.07 102.54 A: if it was made a week ago 

102.79 103.67 B: i know or or 

103.79 105.01 B: how cleanly the 

105.09 105.70 A: yes 

105.44 109.23 B: the uh procedures are yeah 

108.39 111.79 A: we were real careful during this flu season we haven't been eating out much 

112.07 112.42 B: yeah 

112.48 113.71 A: oh so many people have had this 

113.85 115.93 A: you know really bad intestinal problems 

115.89 116.51 B: right 

116.43 119.42 A: you know pass around (( )) i don't think i even want to eat out 

119.82 121.19 A: so we've been eating at home a lot 

121.49 122.43 B: we have and i 

122.61 127.10 B: we do the same thing my (( )) actually it was my birthday today and my daughter made 

126.96 128.04 A: oh happy birthday 

127.59 129.65 B: yeah thank you my daughter made uh 

129.81 131.01 B: made dinner and 

131.19 136.17 B: and and cake and so we ate here at home and we typically do the only 

137.09 138.26 B: like tomorrow i mean 

138.35 139.35 B: i'm going out with 

139.74 142.52 B: a girlfriend and we're going to lunch but unless it's like a 

143.82 148.24 B: i mean at least doesn't always have to be a special occasion but that's typically why 

148.10 148.69 A: mhm 

148.97 150.35 B: why i eat out at a restaurant 

149.98 153.39 A: well it makes you enjoy it more i think too when you don't eat out as much 

152.18 152.73 B: yeah 

153.44 154.07 B: yeah 

154.03 156.28 A: i think it's it makes just that much more special 

155.42 155.96 B: (( )) 

156.59 158.20 B: right 

158.16 158.66 A: mhm 

158.74 159.68 B: that is very true 

159.82 167.02 A: yeah i think we enjoy it for that reason like today we went out to lunch we were all off today and we have a friend that's been visiting 

159.97 160.91 B: and then and then 

167.28 168.04 B: uh-huh

303.51 304.11 A: portions 

304.24 304.66 B: uh-huh 

304.74 309.48 A: and i need to really get my protein in so it's important that i eat something that's high in protein 

309.73 310.11 B: right 

310.38 311.02 A: and uh 

311.25 311.99 B: is that part of 

311.50 311.95 A: so 

312.34 312.87 B: is that part of 

313.19 314.08 B: the surgery having 

314.45 315.74 B: surgery is eating the high proteins 

316.03 316.94 A: yeah well 

317.15 318.14 A: not you have 

318.53 320.22 A: to you you've got mal absorption 

320.84 323.58 A: so you have to make your calories count 

323.99 328.03 A: and you need to get in sixty grams of protein a day which isn't a tremendous amount 

328.69 332.32 A: uh well we they gauge it to everybody's size my amount is sixty 

332.45 332.92 B: uh-huh 

332.76 335.46 A: so that you eat very small meals and we eat about 

335.75 337.45 A: a cup cup and a half at a time 

338.31 339.88 A: so you eat about six meals a day 

340.17 340.46 B: wow 

340.38 340.67 A: so 

341.02 343.00 A: you're put- taking in about 

344.75 347.32 A: anywhere from seven hundred to twelve hundred calories 

347.54 348.48 A: pretty much you choose 

349.29 349.89 B: well that's not 

349.52 349.85 A: and 

350.02 352.44 B: yeah that's not that's about what i'm trying to on

483.21 483.73 B: (( )) 

483.94 484.85 B: yeah that's the killer 

485.07 487.01 A: it's so has so much fat in it

504.46 505.50 B: until you mentioned it i 

505.84 507.09 B: guess i didn't really think 

507.58 512.42 B: about that as much as i did i mean i've been so focused on the calorie and the fat intake (( )) 

512.28 512.82 A: mhm 

512.96 513.71 B: dieting and that 

514.32 516.53 B: but yeah you're right i mean we don't know what
