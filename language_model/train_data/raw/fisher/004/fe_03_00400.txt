291.05 291.40 A: hm 

292.99 294.92 B: some 

294.24 300.58 A: yeah especially if we keep doing it the same way and then find out later it didn't count 

300.71 301.29 B: yeah 

300.83 305.28 A: yeah that would be that wouldn't be good but i honestly don't know since this is the first one i've done so

323.33 323.74 A: yeah 

325.84 329.91 A: oh they've been trying to reach me earlier today but i was 

330.04 335.78 A: away from my phone so i have like three or four messages from their computer um 

335.33 337.14 B: yeah i guess they're needing some people to 

337.59 337.94 B: do it 

339.40 347.34 A: all right they told me it would start today so i guess they've been trying to reach me but i guess this is the first time they've been able to reach me here 

347.64 348.43 A: um 

354.98 355.49 B: right 

361.22 362.18 A: so if you didn't know

363.15 364.55 A: yeah i mean if you hadn't said 

364.67 367.42 A: if you hadn't said it i i wouldn't know exactly what we were 

377.54 379.27 A: so you were talking about the same things earlier 

379.36 379.72 A: today 

385.95 389.44 B: and for the whole school and that it was very beneficial and i was like wow 

389.65 392.03 B: that's kind of crazy that i got hooked up with you 

392.25 401.00 B: i was thinking that i wonder that they manipulated this but they didn't me and you don't aren't involved in education because she asked me if i was a teacher and i was like no 

392.53 393.00 A: uh-huh 

401.41 405.08 B: but that my major at university of georgia i take a lot of um 

405.48 407.81 B: a lot of the early childhood classes 

408.07 409.86 B: because it's a similar major 

408.38 408.73 A: uh-huh 

410.25 411.87 B: are you did you go to school 

412.00 412.62 B: (( )) 

412.88 413.25 B: college 

413.87 417.63 A: yeah yeah um i'm wondering if maybe that has something to do with it 

414.72 415.06 B: uh-huh 

418.21 426.78 A: all though the message that they left me before said like the topic of the day is education so maybe it has nothing to do with us maybe it's just the way they are one today 

427.64 428.59 A: i don't i don't really know 

427.90 432.55 B: uh yeah because they left me a message saying it was for middle east so 

432.95 438.05 B: i don't think it has to really necessarily do with education but it seems like yes 

436.26 437.28 A: middle east huh 

438.43 439.09 B: trying to 

439.67 440.98 B: i want to see 

441.34 444.79 B: do you have the number the time of how long we've been on here 

445.41 446.00 A: do i have the what 

445.87 447.99 B: seems like we've been on here for ten minutes 

448.96 453.26 A: oh yeah i've been timing us actually we've been on for almost eight minutes 

449.09 449.73 B: (( )) 

453.88 454.98 B: okay do you want to just 

455.10 457.62 B: sit on the phone until they just 

457.37 459.38 A: (( )) if you are 

466.38 467.73 B: i mean if it 

467.90 474.04 B: i mean i definitely wouldn't want to just hang up at nine nine minutes and thirty seconds and it's like man 

474.16 475.87 B: not going to get ten dollars you know 

474.41 475.12 A: right 

476.17 477.04 A: yeah that 

476.20 478.38 B: because i don't i don't really care so we can just 

477.88 479.15 A: no body benefits from that 

479.34 481.10 A: probably not even them 

489.78 490.14 A: yeah 

509.01 509.50 A: yeah 

509.27 511.09 B: what kind of what kind of ice cream do you want
