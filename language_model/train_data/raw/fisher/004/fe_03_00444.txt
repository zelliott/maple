0.56 1.04 A: jan 

2.87 3.20 A: hi 

3.70 4.08 B: hello 

4.25 5.06 A: what's your name 

6.27 7.82 A: steve i'm jan um 

8.38 13.58 A: i got a call earlier today about the same topic and so you go ahead and give your input 

13.70 16.73 A: and then i guess i'll respond then i think we just hang up 

17.07 17.46 B: alright 

18.25 19.03 B: well um 

19.56 20.93 B: corporate conduct today uh 

21.77 24.48 B: i haven't been personally i haven't personally been affected 

24.73 25.66 B: but um 

25.99 28.15 B: i've seen a lot of stuff on the news about it 

30.60 32.24 B: these days in the government we've we've 

32.59 37.19 B: uh actually for a long time in the u._s. we've had a laissez faire attitude you know we just say you know 

37.34 38.50 B: stay away from the government 

38.67 39.96 B: let them do what ever they want to do 

40.15 42.33 B: and stay away from business let them do what ever they want to do 

42.74 43.81 B: and it it's all good 

43.96 44.45 B: but 

45.54 47.87 B: i i don't see that the government has a responsibility 

48.39 50.51 B: to make sure that share holders make money 

50.95 52.65 B: it's just it doesn't make any sense to me 

55.48 56.44 A: um 

56.94 62.94 A: i do feel like uh i agree that the it's not affected me in any way uh 

63.56 69.17 A: i do feel like this is securities and exchange commission should be doing uh 

69.52 71.37 A: more deeper checks and balances 

71.66 72.19 A: on 

72.34 75.48 A: on the commission on the big corporations that are 

75.11 76.53 B: well the thing is though that um 

77.15 79.07 B: the companies are not out of line 

79.26 86.35 B: they lied on their statements yes but on the truth is though they all used loop holes to make their companies look better 

87.16 87.58 A: yeah 

88.20 88.47 A: yeah 

88.29 92.94 B: you have to actually make sure the g._a._p._p. no g._a._a._p. 

93.40 99.07 B: um and s._e._c. actually updated their guidelines which is not going to happened because they're all made up by businessmen 

99.71 100.24 A: right 

100.14 102.73 B: mostly businessmen and maybe some academics 

103.22 108.55 A: yeah that i agree that their not going to make it any more difficult on themselves 

108.94 109.35 A: but 

109.49 109.96 A: uh 

110.06 115.50 A: i i also feel like the government is too involved in too many other things to be concerned about 

115.81 117.84 A: uh running large corporations 

118.36 119.16 B: well well 

118.39 118.95 A: you know 

119.40 124.01 B: we we should be concerned with that because we're in a recessionary economy 

123.81 124.27 A: mhm 

124.24 128.93 B: and even though uh republicans will say that uh war 

129.27 130.72 B: does rejuvenate the economy 

131.03 131.97 B: which is very true 

132.50 135.13 B: it it might not be something we all want to go into to 

135.80 136.38 A: right 

136.81 138.37 B: which that's just my opinion obviously 

138.55 138.92 A: yeah 

138.95 139.77 B: i don't know what you think 

140.09 140.46 A: well 

141.28 150.39 A: i think that they do need to have deeper checks and balances like you say it's probably not going to happen but it's something that should happen and uh 

151.91 153.20 A: uh fortunately 

153.41 153.92 A: you know 

154.35 162.50 A: i don't feel like it's hurt the stock market and the global economy that much but i do feel like it has contributed some what to the recession that we're in 

162.36 166.36 B: i think it's it's reduced uh confidence in in companies 

166.43 167.09 A: right 

166.72 171.42 B: the american persons confidence in the stock market which we though before it was bullet proof 

168.66 169.03 A: right 

171.58 171.99 A: mhm 

171.83 175.90 B: all these dot coms making making all this money not even making all this money but 

176.04 178.63 B: producing returns for the investor 

179.51 186.15 B: and uh the investor felt good and today and today after enron and and kodak and xerox or which ever it was 

186.19 186.67 A: mhm 

186.83 188.10 B: they they all feel uh 

188.75 189.62 B: they've been betrayed 

189.84 190.28 A: mhm 

189.88 190.31 B: like 

190.53 191.32 B: uh 

191.14 191.82 A: right 

191.62 197.94 B: but the truth is though that these companies have nothing they really have no responsibility to the shareholder 

198.03 200.32 B: except to produce returns and 

200.07 202.36 A: right to try and make a profit for them yeah 

201.84 205.74 B: and to make a profit exactly they have no social responsibility at all 

205.91 206.30 B: so 

206.58 212.90 B: even even though they are lies that the american public and maybe even a little bit to their shareholders they were doing it in 

213.56 215.92 B: if not their own best interest you know the 

216.15 223.25 B: the c._e._o.'s the c._f._o.'s the presidents not even not if even their best interest also the share holders interest 

223.44 223.83 A: yeah 

225.83 229.29 B: lie here you know advertise here you know they all do it 

233.65 235.88 A: some of them are getting caught because it's getting so 

236.47 237.93 A: deep that you know 

238.86 240.07 A: it's starting to 

240.58 245.07 A: there's so many loses that people are going wait a minute and then they're getting found out but 

246.07 250.21 A: i i do believe that it has contributed to to the recession do you 

250.67 250.99 A: same 

251.17 252.48 B: the recession um 

252.77 255.27 A: or the sagging economy we are having 

254.70 258.47 B: i think the economy was was was already doing poorly even before 

258.88 264.00 B: uh what is recognized as the break down of the economy which is september eleventh 

258.98 259.92 A: before yeah 

264.12 264.79 A: right 

264.92 265.99 B: um 

266.31 275.65 A: i agree with that too because i had heard on the news that they were saying that when clinton left office that bush actually went into office at the start of a recession 

275.72 278.00 B: yeah which which is actually um 

275.83 276.36 A: you know 

278.28 279.73 A: before any of this 

279.55 279.94 B: yeah 

280.10 280.53 A: yeah 

281.37 282.48 B: and um 

281.48 281.91 A: um 

283.20 285.67 B: just the it just couldn't it obviously um 

286.49 287.58 B: helps make 

287.77 289.07 B: the consumer feel bad 

289.46 292.51 B: um makes him feel a little be bit less optimistic 

292.95 295.10 B: about getting him out of the recession but 

295.36 297.88 B: contributing significantly i don't think so 

298.53 298.93 A: yeah 

298.93 300.81 B: it may have slowed investing but 

301.15 304.40 B: the truth is investing wasn't happening anyway because we were already in a recession 

309.78 312.42 A: for us not relying on the government because 

312.67 315.17 A: you know americans have always been able to pick themselves up 

315.32 322.40 A: from what ever crisis and move on and actually that's kind of the attitude i have and i believe that 

322.67 324.68 A: if we can do it we should try and make 

324.94 325.31 A: uh 

325.90 328.25 A: not become consumer drones but 

328.36 338.11 A: you know try to make large purchases if we can if if we have the need for that item and and try to stimulate the economy which is what i just did we just purchased a second home so 

337.76 338.53 B: wow 

338.74 340.25 A: well we bought it for my father 

340.65 340.99 A: but 

341.45 350.41 A: i was like you know tell the bank lady when we're there taking out the loan we're trying to do our part to stimulate the sagging economy here 

350.57 358.56 A: so i i do feel like it's not something the governments going to pull us out of that we just need to pull up our boots and 

358.68 361.35 A: muddle through it just like we did the recession of the eighties 

361.47 362.68 B: well i think i think 

363.20 365.47 B: me being a college student first of all 

366.12 370.22 B: um i i'm a bit more liberal fresh eyed 

369.78 370.19 A: mhm 

370.32 370.90 A: mhm 

370.32 370.99 B: you know what it is right 

371.65 372.23 B: and 

372.60 373.27 B: it it just 

373.55 374.66 B: strikes me as 

375.55 376.20 B: um 

376.69 377.54 B: a little 

378.92 381.69 B: a little naive to just think that we should we should try to just 

382.34 383.99 B: um spend our way out of it 

384.14 392.03 B: which works the whole economy thing because i think we should be thinking deeper and harder about other issues that are causing us to feel this so hard 

394.20 394.96 A: like 

395.25 395.63 B: well 

395.25 396.69 A: what what is she 

396.96 398.54 B: well um i don't know um 

400.75 402.77 B: this experiment is kind of funny because 

403.16 404.87 B: i really have no idea who it talks to 

405.43 407.10 A: right well same here yeah 

405.83 406.40 B: right 

408.52 409.18 B: but um 

409.10 411.80 A: i'm i'm a forty two year our female 

411.65 413.56 B: i'm a nineteen year old college student 

413.09 413.56 A: okay 

414.78 417.01 A: it that that may be a naive 

414.83 415.45 B: um 

417.27 420.42 A: uh aspect from your from your viewpoint but 

420.84 423.37 A: i don't i don't see another way 

421.89 427.21 B: no it's not naive it's perfectly rational and sensible it it's totally sensible 

427.76 429.51 B: because i can see exactly where you're coming from 

430.49 432.69 B: but me i i where i don't even have a job 

432.83 433.39 A: right 

433.34 433.96 B: right 

433.63 435.32 A: you're a struggling student 

434.93 443.04 B: i'm just i'm just a student exactly i i'm just trying to be a little more idealistic why do we have these problems and why 

443.59 444.70 B: why is it that we must 

444.89 446.38 B: get ourselves out of this economy 

447.38 449.39 B: why is our economy so consumer driven 

449.79 450.33 A: mhm 

450.19 451.44 B: you know 

452.19 459.25 B: if if our government adopted more liberal stance or a more socialistic stance you know social programs government health care health care you know that kind of thing 

459.33 459.81 A: mhm 

460.20 460.74 B: i think 

461.02 462.70 B: even if we were in a recession 

464.05 473.25 B: um our people would not have such a hard time um trusting the government which we have a problem here we have a problem trusting the government we have a problem trusting the 

473.39 474.90 B: uh trusting companies 

475.56 477.63 B: look at canada canada um 

480.06 480.56 A: mhm 

483.90 486.29 B: all the all the liberals here are clamoring for 

486.70 489.96 B: and what's what's their unemployment rate fifteen percent 

490.39 491.96 B: three times what we have here in america 

492.60 494.50 B: even in a recessionary economy 

494.68 495.14 A: mhm 

494.97 496.03 B: which is strange you know 

496.43 497.46 B: to to think that 

497.57 498.28 B: canada 

498.79 500.44 B: has such a high unemployment rate 

501.68 505.24 B: and they're supposedly such a great country and they are 

505.25 505.66 A: mhm 

505.76 506.99 B: they're not as militaristic 

507.18 507.72 B: they don't get 

507.83 510.21 B: all their tax money doesn't go to the military 

510.74 511.37 B: um 

512.42 518.51 B: there's not as many corporate scandals because uh it's not such a consumer driven society that 

518.72 519.59 B: will always 

520.08 520.67 B: um 

521.30 523.66 B: put the interest of the corporation before the person 

523.77 524.24 A: mhm 

527.68 531.97 B: i mean do you feel that like that some some sometimes that the corporations is actually treated more 

532.55 536.34 B: treated more importantly then the actual individual here in america 

536.58 537.55 A: oh definitely 

537.69 538.33 A: definitely 

538.46 539.48 A: uh you know that's 

540.21 540.60 A: you know 

540.69 543.57 A: to me the men the people in power like that's what makes 

543.84 545.45 A: our wheels turn you know 

545.70 546.01 B: yeah 

546.12 546.63 A: uh 

546.99 551.48 A: to heck with the little people you know definitely i definitely 

550.30 551.67 B: what part of the country you are in 

551.74 558.26 A: i'm in oklahoma and say i'm forty two so i mean be kind of cynical by now and you know 

558.62 560.09 A: kind of raised in the 

560.25 563.98 A: in the sixty seventies era you know where 

562.90 564.01 B: uh-huh flower power 

564.09 567.49 A: where never don't don't trust any of them anyway you know 

567.64 568.64 A: so um 

568.95 570.58 A: yeah and 

569.78 572.05 B: there's no reason to trust them their really isn't 

571.54 572.00 A: right 

572.10 574.32 A: because they're just i mean 

574.77 583.22 A: truly all the people in power are there for their own gain they're not their to represent you or make life better for you or get you out of welfare you know 

583.10 583.70 B: not at all 

583.82 588.40 A: no they don't care they could they can't even be bothered with us 

584.36 584.97 B: not at all 

588.77 590.74 B: no it it's all about 

590.91 592.45 B: catering to their interests 

592.93 595.63 B: um try to make them trying to make themselves richer 

595.80 596.14 A: yeah 

596.41 596.78 B: you know 

596.83 599.96 A: and if that involves manipulating some numbers hey
