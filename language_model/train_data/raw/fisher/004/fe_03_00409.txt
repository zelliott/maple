25.42 26.93 A: yeah 

26.75 29.63 B: yeah and i think she had the same topic today as a matter of fact 

30.52 31.22 A: oh 

31.94 32.37 B: so 

32.27 35.34 A: cool okay so computers and education 

35.45 36.01 B: exactly 

35.45 36.69 A: um 

37.18 39.94 A: i'm actually a computer science student 

40.12 40.90 B: really 

41.02 42.35 B: i have a b._s. in computer science 

41.11 41.61 A: yeah 

42.85 43.51 A: oh 

44.77 46.33 B: that's weird yeah 

46.24 47.91 A: so 

47.31 50.08 B: i'm sure we should we probably share the same views 

50.69 52.62 A: probably that it's good 

52.33 53.07 B: yeah true 

54.22 54.77 A: hm 

55.18 55.74 B: well 

55.98 56.90 B: that's um 

57.79 58.88 B: see because when i was in 

60.10 62.28 B: elementary school middle school even high school 

62.70 63.44 B: you know we didn't 

64.05 66.96 B: you know we didn't have it that was because i graduated in high school in eighty eight 

67.48 68.07 A: right 

67.99 70.10 B: so computers back then were apple two e.'s 

70.52 71.89 B: you know i grew up on a (( )) 

72.02 73.12 B: foreign so now 

74.28 75.04 B: ah 

75.59 81.55 B: of course it's important i mean it's everywhere you go it's in the work place and of course i'm a little bias i work for i._b._m. in colorado so 

82.70 83.04 B: so i 

83.23 83.95 B: (( )) 

84.24 85.49 B: computers have a ah 

85.67 86.61 B: place in education 

87.08 87.99 B: absolutely 

89.23 90.01 B: so 

90.55 92.00 B: i mean if you don't if you don't know it 

92.67 93.41 B: you know what i'm saying 

93.66 96.06 B: it's part of your everyday like so yeah i 

93.82 94.41 A: yeah 

96.55 97.23 A: yeah 

97.05 97.85 B: of course i agree 

98.29 101.67 A: i think since computers are involved in so many things 

101.79 102.22 B: mhm 

102.13 102.94 A: ah 

103.65 107.60 A: even if you are not directly doing something with computers 

108.32 110.27 A: you wouldn't normally think of it that 

110.42 112.07 A: you would probably come across it 

112.21 113.07 A: so 

112.24 113.07 B: right right 

113.45 115.06 A: like the younger you learn it the 

115.27 115.81 A: more like 

116.88 119.75 A: you know well you can adjust and stuff 

118.94 122.29 B: that's yeah because for me i can i remember back 

122.93 125.89 B: i can i'm not old old i'm in my low thirties but 

126.05 126.47 A: uh-huh 

126.59 127.71 B: i can remember 

128.33 129.11 B: no having 

129.79 130.95 B: computers you know what i'm saying 

131.21 131.75 A: yeah 

131.62 135.28 B: now we have let me see i'm just looking at my computer room one 

135.70 136.52 B: two three 

136.63 137.04 B: four 

137.34 137.96 B: five 

138.16 139.44 B: just in my computer room 

139.59 140.59 A: wow 

140.09 144.55 B: and kim has one and i've a work laptop so we've got seven or eight in the house 

145.27 147.39 B: so i mean with out email i would be lost 

148.00 148.64 A: right 

148.07 149.70 B: so of course my mom and dad 

150.49 158.27 B: now my dad tries to be a geek but he's not but my mom my mom's not she's got a computer so she's learning i think the older you are 

155.06 155.95 A: yeah 

158.46 159.33 B: you know the less 

159.60 161.47 B: i don't know well i don't know that's that's kind of 

162.49 164.17 B: being stereotypical but 

163.88 164.52 A: right 

164.47 165.82 B: at least for my folks it is 

166.48 169.14 A: yeah for my mom it's the same like 

166.87 167.26 B: so 

170.37 172.42 A: like she tries to learn but 

172.59 175.31 A: she doesn't pick up that quickly and like 

174.52 175.22 B: exactly yeah 

175.48 176.11 B: yeah that's 

175.52 178.27 A: maybe some other people can but just 

178.45 179.83 A: i don't know she can't 

179.09 182.62 B: well that's that's the way my mom is she's a little she's a little scared of it and i have ah 

180.81 181.43 A: yeah 

183.12 187.11 B: i have a niece who is probably creeping up on three and so you know 

187.36 188.84 B: so she's being brought up 

189.74 191.18 B: on computers do you know what i'm saying 

191.42 192.04 A: right 

191.43 193.21 B: so she she's around it everyday 

194.30 198.14 B: so by the time she gets you know a couple more years two or three more years whatever she's in 

198.50 200.35 B: first grade you know she's eh 

200.68 201.81 B: you know she'll know the basics 

202.31 205.53 B: i'm assuming you know she know what it is and how to navigate and 

202.42 203.12 A: right 

205.80 207.80 B: at least try to find out where the games are 

208.21 208.55 B: so 

208.29 208.80 A: right 

209.38 211.57 B: yeah so i agree it has it's place in 

211.96 213.86 B: in in education obviously 

213.98 214.29 B: so 

214.65 215.19 A: yeah 

215.62 216.20 B: ah 

216.33 217.62 B: computer science major i guess 

218.22 222.47 A: yeah computer science um the university of pennsylvania 

218.66 219.32 B: what school 

222.26 223.37 B: oh and at penn 

224.25 224.65 A: hm

250.19 254.19 A: um several several different schools but i signed up 

252.90 253.42 B: uh-huh 

254.30 255.75 A: from a webpage that 

256.26 258.52 A: was associated with my school 

258.65 260.47 B: right yeah so did we 

259.24 261.06 A: which the program 

260.80 261.23 B: yeah 

261.54 265.50 A: um because my brother goes to um the university of or 

266.21 266.81 A: um 

267.25 274.27 A: west chester institute of technology and he sent me a link because apparently their school is doing it too 

269.44 269.72 B: hm 

274.41 274.88 B: right 

275.22 277.49 A: so how did you sign up for it like 

277.07 280.11 B: we i found this i we live um 

280.42 281.58 B: in boulder colorado 

282.23 282.61 A: mhm 

282.84 283.82 B: and ah 

284.00 287.70 B: there's a a magazine it's like a free weekly newspaper called the boulder weekly 

288.28 288.84 A: oh 

288.30 292.31 B: and it caters to the university the students of the university of colorado university 

292.70 293.73 B: and the catch was 

294.79 297.75 B: pay get ten dollars to do this study 

297.91 298.71 B: see what it was about 

299.17 300.19 A: right yeah 

299.79 301.73 B: and i was telling my wife about it and we're like 

302.13 303.89 B: yeah sure why not let's do it anyway 

304.04 304.31 B: so 

304.39 304.72 A: yeah 

304.99 306.24 B: we decided to do it so 

306.46 308.71 B: we we've been getting several calls 

309.16 309.84 A: really 

309.25 310.79 B: yeah so it's 

310.35 313.64 A: i think my page said you could only get up to three 

313.93 316.26 B: yeah that's what ours says but our phones been ringing off the hook 

316.42 318.06 A: wow that's so cool 

317.74 319.20 B: because we haven't been home 

319.54 320.80 B: and then last night i got 

319.80 320.29 A: uh-huh 

321.92 323.49 B: a little impatient and hung up 

323.98 324.95 A: oh 

324.07 324.59 B: oh 

324.73 326.34 B: but ah but today 

326.67 329.62 B: when i answered the phone you and i were connected immediately 

329.97 331.12 A: oh okay yeah 

330.35 332.46 B: and when when she got her call 

332.80 337.19 B: she was also connecting immediately and i guess we're all talking about the same topic so 

337.65 338.13 A: right 

338.49 339.13 B: but anyway 

340.08 341.74 A: yeah mm hm 

341.96 344.32 B: so what do we do do we hang out until they say we can stop 

344.46 348.17 A: i think so i think they said ten minuets so we've been 

347.07 351.82 B: so what're what are they do you know what they are doing with this are they recording this and do they listen to it later 

352.16 352.72 A: well i think 

353.22 355.77 A: i'm not sure what the actual study is 

355.88 358.82 A: i didn't read it too thoroughly 

358.06 361.36 B: yeah i did a little bit i wasn't sure if it was 

362.27 366.20 B: i don't know if it's focused on like linguistics or if it's focused on 

366.61 369.70 B: like information exchange or 

369.32 370.35 A: right 

369.99 373.18 B: enter you know interaction or communication i'm not rally sure what it's 

373.71 375.24 B: what it's actually focusing on 

375.68 376.05 B: if 

375.71 379.28 A: right i i think it might be something like 

379.50 384.55 A: um just studying the way people interact and talk maybe to like reproduce it somehow 

384.37 386.28 B: mm okay i see what you're saying 

385.52 386.87 A: like maybe 

386.98 387.63 A: with in 

388.12 390.01 A: i don't know an expert system or like 

390.33 390.99 A: something 

391.15 395.65 A: i'm not sure but they must be recording it 

392.49 393.81 B: well that makes sense because see 

394.90 398.96 B: yeah they i think they said they were because because my thing would be okay this is a topic 

399.44 400.27 B: i mean but how 

401.07 402.88 B: i mean how long can you go on about that 

403.29 405.02 B: you either agree or disagree and i 

403.33 403.89 A: right 

405.10 405.77 A: yeah 

405.48 408.31 B: think the majority of people are going to agree because it's pretty obvious 

409.05 412.94 A: right i can't think of anything that is bad about it 

409.24 410.00 B: it's really 

412.76 413.13 B: yeah 

413.38 417.39 B: because i think yesterday when i got before i got impatient and hung up the topic was 

418.62 419.58 B: uh 

420.24 422.45 B: what nation or nations 

422.56 423.33 B: do you think 

423.49 424.31 B: pose a threat 

424.51 426.14 B: to the u._s. or something to that 

426.00 426.63 A: oh 

427.32 430.03 B: i mean that maybe could have sparked a little discussion 

430.58 431.18 A: right 

431.05 432.27 B: this seems pretty straight 

431.77 441.68 A: but only if only if you're like knowledgeable about that like if you really don't pay attention to anything then you wouldn't have much to say 

436.16 436.63 B: yeah 

439.56 441.00 B: yeah that's true that's true 

441.54 443.85 B: but i i think what would have been interesting 

444.05 446.16 B: for this topic i think it's weird that 

447.05 447.67 B: two 

448.17 449.03 B: computer science 

449.50 450.87 B: people got hooked up but 

451.27 453.70 B: you know say you or me talking to 

451.35 452.32 A: right 

454.24 454.78 B: someone who's 

455.45 455.98 B: sixty 

456.44 460.01 B: you know or seventy again that's being slightly stereotypical but 

457.24 457.85 A: right 

460.18 460.69 A: right 

460.85 465.12 B: you know you never know like my mom if she took part in this and she had this discussion you know 

465.58 466.14 A: uh-huh 

465.74 467.95 B: it would be interesting to see what she had to say about it 

467.78 469.54 A: yeah that's true 

470.13 470.47 B: so 

470.21 470.55 A: true 

472.10 473.38 B: so how's the weather in philadelphia 

473.64 474.31 A: um 

474.42 476.39 A: it was really cold today 

476.26 476.77 B: oh really 

476.56 479.40 A: yeah i can't wait for it to get warmer 

479.47 481.48 B: well it's cold in colorado we suppose 

481.17 482.82 A: oh i bet 

481.72 482.85 B: gets some snow but 

483.05 485.49 B: we we've been missing out on the snow so 

487.52 490.41 B: so we've had a pretty mild a mild and dry 

487.73 489.19 A: that's good at least 

491.78 493.25 B: mild and dry winter 

493.62 494.38 A: oh 

494.33 494.98 B: yeah 

494.49 496.39 A: but you usual get a lot of snow
