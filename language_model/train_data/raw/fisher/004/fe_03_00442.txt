49.61 54.56 B: right i think that maybe there's too much government involvement as it is 

55.25 60.11 A: well see i think that the i don't know if it's as much the government or just the uh 

60.25 64.66 A: f._a._s._d. needs to which is the organization that oversees accounting 

65.31 69.32 A: and sets up the gaff rules which are the generally accepted accounting practices 

69.83 73.33 A: i think that those practices need to be reviewed by 

73.70 75.04 A: f._a._s._d. 

75.59 77.12 A: and i think the government should 

78.06 85.46 A: uh be willing to put some penalties in when people don't follow gaff but i think gaff needs to be reviewed not 

85.94 89.80 A: really the government getting in and doing something about it specifically 

90.93 91.30 B: well 

91.15 92.32 A: that's what my thoughts are 

92.72 95.20 B: you seem to have a little more knowledge about what the 

95.35 95.70 B: the 

95.85 96.11 B: about 

96.28 98.42 B: the government than i i haven- 

98.66 101.03 B: i have it from the other angle of social work 

101.30 104.17 B: kind of angle and i know that uh 

102.39 103.00 A: ah 

104.46 107.93 B: a a lot of small the government interference 

107.95 108.43 A: mhm 

108.07 110.07 B: causes a lot of small businesses 

110.42 111.57 B: to go defunk 

112.10 112.65 B: and 

113.89 114.29 B: a 

114.54 117.29 B: corporate the large corporations 

117.40 127.62 B: uh seem to be what the government is there to protect and i guess i can understand why because you're talking about a majority of the voters and the and the and the population that are effected 

121.98 122.65 A: that i can 

128.06 128.61 A: yeah 

128.54 129.14 B: but uh 

129.54 131.48 B: you know i can understand why there emp- there 

129.59 130.31 A: well i think i'm 

132.72 134.08 B: why they are 

134.37 134.86 B: um 

135.78 136.85 B: they ke- they 

137.08 138.98 B: key in on uh 

139.22 141.89 B: the larger corporations but uh 

142.08 146.93 B: yeah i'm not i have no idea about accounting practices cause that's not my 

146.07 149.29 A: yeah see i i'm coming at it from an accounting point of view 

150.00 151.72 A: because that's my background 

151.89 156.52 A: so i and i can see your coming at it from a different one that's which is interesting 

154.65 158.78 B: right i'm coming at yeah that's that it's interesting cause cause 

158.97 161.13 B: you know i i i indicated that 

161.57 164.44 B: you know on the questionnaire you know 

162.88 163.44 A: uh-huh 

163.57 165.18 A: yes i indicated that 

172.37 183.22 A: accounting but i've also been doing bookkeeping for years which i didn't even i did not put all of that information but and i also have run a small business and i also do web design so 

183.98 189.42 A: you know i do see it from the small business point of view to i guess it it should have been 

190.15 197.15 A: i wish i would've heard the question poignantly i'm thinking that what you're saying is what they wanted us to discuss is 

198.13 201.82 A: what's happened you know if we want the government to get involved 

199.62 201.84 B: right what's happened with enron and 

202.27 205.87 A: to to make sure things like enron don't happen again and i would say 

206.61 213.66 A: if that is the question that you got to get at the root of the problem i don't think the government can come i don't want the government getting in to 

214.34 219.83 A: in to businesses either small business or large businesses if at all possible i think it should stop 

220.29 223.63 A: the problem should be identified and stopped and and certain ex- 

223.78 225.19 A: expectations set out 

225.66 226.67 A: from the get go 

227.00 230.47 A: for both small and large businesses it's just a matter of everybody 

230.59 231.90 A: truly does need 

232.02 232.71 A: to be 

233.07 237.99 A: um handled evenhandedly though whether it's large or small businesses i don't 

238.56 243.39 A: i see what you're saying you're saying well it seems to you like there there's more enforcement on the 

243.50 246.58 A: small businesses than there are on the big because the big can pay to 

247.31 248.39 A: to skirt around them 

248.48 249.39 A: and that's true 

248.68 249.15 B: right 

249.54 250.09 B: yes 

249.69 251.84 A: that's true i agree a hundred percent 

252.17 259.29 A: unfortunately that's kind of the way of the world it's been like that for you know four thousand years 

254.35 256.27 B: well right right 

256.41 258.21 B: right and i 

258.49 261.44 B: yes an- and and and you can understand why 

261.54 263.62 B: but th- that doesn't make it uh 

261.56 262.27 A: hm 

264.32 268.12 B: make it any easier to to digest especially when you're on the 

265.37 265.97 A: yeah 

268.24 276.64 B: receiving end norma- i mean i work for the government in the social work angle and and i have worked for small businesses and 

269.59 270.13 A: right 

273.30 274.05 A: mhm 

276.80 281.44 B: you see where the pressures from the small busin- th- that that the small businesses 

282.27 283.72 B: take from 

284.21 286.12 B: too much government interference 

285.41 286.11 A: oh yeah 

286.21 294.55 A: well i mean it can be the be it can eve- even be the thing i mean it so easily the thing that just ruins a small business because there so fragile 

293.21 293.66 B: right 

294.99 297.54 A: a large business is so much more resilient 

298.10 302.32 A: you know by the time it gets to the point where it's an enron oh my word 

303.16 305.95 A: you know those guys at a you could have a 

306.32 310.97 A: you know a hundred million dollar settlement against them and it will hardly make them bat an eye 

312.18 312.68 A: so 

312.90 317.28 A: whereas a small busi- i have a friend who's um right now being sued 

317.41 321.19 A: he's got no relation to what happened but it's a construction kind of thing 

322.51 330.87 A: and somebody got hurt on the construction site which he had no he was like another sub-contractor no bearing on it at all 

331.18 333.30 A: it's costing him thousands of dollars 

333.91 335.41 B: or that he can ill afford 

334.34 334.77 A: for 

335.61 338.04 A: which he can ill afford exactly 

337.49 337.99 B: right 

338.55 340.39 A: and the insurance company 

340.99 345.19 A: can afford you know umpteenth thousands of dollars 

344.90 345.72 B: right they 

345.92 350.08 A: to hit everybody who's wi- within a stones throw of where this guy got hurt 

350.24 355.26 A: and that's basically what they're doing they're throwing out a wide net which that's a tort reform issue 

356.32 357.27 A: you know 

358.26 363.11 A: and i think that's another issue but it's not necessarily directly related to 

363.90 365.34 A: to the enron case 

365.78 372.45 A: but it seems to me i mean i have learned tremendous amount about the way that like when when a company sells options 

372.90 378.39 A: that used to not an option is basically an obligation it's almost a liability for the company 

379.01 381.60 A: and yet it's not even on any of the reportings 

381.96 385.64 A: it's not necessarily in any reporting so a company can look 

386.65 389.38 A: like they're doing a lot better than they are in one sense 

389.96 391.07 A: and that's because 

391.23 392.03 A: of the gap 

392.22 398.04 A: holes that's because the accounting rules and i think the accounting industry is going to have 

398.24 401.00 A: most people who are you know in that 

401.38 402.54 A: sector will a say that 

402.71 411.34 A: there's going to be tremendous changes and a lot of re-training because things are getting going to have to be done differently otherwise we're going to have this problem 

413.30 415.79 B: i agree with you i mean 

416.00 417.27 B: i agree with you 

417.81 418.56 B: pretty much 

419.33 419.97 B: under- 

420.10 425.23 B: e- even without understanding a lot of what you're saying because i like i said that is 

425.39 428.72 B: you know that is just not my field 

428.48 429.10 A: right 

429.09 429.61 B: and 

429.21 432.58 A: well ga- to simplify it gaff is just the rules 

432.98 433.56 A: that 

433.81 435.93 A: accountants are supposed to live by 

436.18 443.29 A: that's the way they're supposed to record uh uh liability or an asset or stocks or 

443.40 445.49 A: just how how you do your books 

446.01 448.72 A: it's just your ba- basic rules for how to do the books 

449.87 450.72 B: okay 

450.06 452.36 A: and if those bo- if those rules 

452.86 461.09 A: have all these loopholes so that even though you have obligations are liabilities or loans you can almost think of it like loans it's like not putting on 

461.64 462.23 A: your 

462.85 464.87 A: your statement that says your worth 

465.12 466.75 A: (( )) hundred thousand dollars 

467.34 472.00 A: you say you're worth a hundred thousand dollars but if you don't put on there that ninety percent of it 

472.33 474.19 A: either it be assets that you own 

474.63 481.13 A: or actually owned by your bank because you have a loan for ninety thousands dollars on your house now that's not being really truthful is it 

477.02 477.54 B: right 

481.09 483.11 B: right okay i get you there yes 

482.87 488.30 A: see so that's what happens for instance in the in just the one aspect of options 

488.64 489.60 A: options are like 

489.85 491.00 A: a liability 

491.43 496.95 A: they are basically something that you owe somebody in a sense at any time they can say 

497.51 499.09 A: all right you now have to pay me 

499.48 501.23 A: okay it's there option to say 

501.89 502.69 A: you got to pay me 

502.97 507.15 A: so you have to think of it as a liability it's like a loan in a sense 

506.75 507.41 B: uh-huh 

507.25 509.82 A: for those companies but they are not required to put 

510.41 514.83 A: options on there balance sheets on there income statements or anything like that 

516.78 519.36 A: and that's because of the rules of accounting 

520.49 521.19 A: that said 

520.70 526.70 B: cause the rules of accounting that that's a necessity so maybe somehow those need to be changed 

524.35 525.30 A: right 

526.49 530.81 A: exactly and that's where i think that before we get a whole lot of government 

531.23 532.76 A: fiddling around in there 

533.05 537.26 A: i mean i think it'd be reasonable for the government to look at the rules the gaff rules 

537.38 537.85 B: mhm 

537.99 539.38 A: and say okay 

539.79 547.76 A: this looks reasonable this doesn't you know they could check them over but the organization that usually sets up the gaff rules is called the f._a._f._b. 

548.37 549.88 A: and the f._a._f._b. 

550.18 555.48 A: is in meetings right now to review and revi- and revise all of the gaff rules 

556.11 560.69 A: in fact some of the companies have already said we're going to now start listing 

575.96 577.23 B: voluntarily 

593.60 593.95 B: right 

594.63 599.11 B: if the economy turns around people are going to forget all about what happened with enron
