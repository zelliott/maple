49.29 50.78 B: i'm assuming that 

54.50 56.81 A: introduce yourself and then you go on to outdoor activities 

57.30 58.19 B: oh okay 

58.38 59.18 A: but i don't know 

59.56 60.86 B: me neither i'm not sure 

61.05 62.49 A: i figure by now it would have already 

62.87 63.49 A: chimed in 

64.27 64.94 B: oh 

64.40 66.56 A: i mean i guess we could start on it 

66.51 67.83 B: yeah that would be a good idea 

67.94 68.39 A: um 

69.21 71.88 A: i like to do activities that are in the cold so 

72.00 73.38 A: because i i don't like 

74.05 74.54 A: um 

75.00 77.30 A: i don't like to be outside in the hot it makes me 

77.41 79.45 A: like sweat too much and then i just don't feel like 

79.56 80.60 A: continuing working 

81.13 83.56 A: or working out or anything like that like walking or 

81.15 81.49 B: oh 

83.73 85.57 A: running or bicycling something like that 

86.18 87.02 B: oh okay 

87.25 89.64 B: well i like um activities outdoor too 

90.29 92.09 B: i don't like t- the cold outside 

92.49 92.87 A: yeah 

93.36 102.21 B: yeah i like t- i think there's more options to go out you know the weather's nice and everything even though it's hot you could wear less clothes but if it's cold you could basically get sick from the cold 

102.33 102.73 A: right 

103.16 103.96 B: yeah and i like 

103.38 105.96 A: and then of course your body warms up as you start doing something 

106.21 108.24 B: yeah exactly and plus i like 

107.51 108.47 A: so that helps with it 

108.80 110.14 B: yeah i work out at the gym 

110.73 111.29 A: oh do you 

111.43 111.99 B: yeah 

112.12 113.26 B: so that's like 

113.35 116.64 B: that's great for me you know that's convenient any time of the year 

116.95 117.40 A: right 

118.20 121.22 A: see i don't i don't work out at the gym i don't have membership to do that 

121.63 122.61 A: so i just basically 

122.78 124.12 A: do like tapes or 

124.44 126.10 A: go outside and walk or 

126.72 127.24 A: you know 

127.50 129.20 A: we walk stairs stuff like that 

129.63 135.11 B: yeah because i live in north carolina and it's like basically in all these other states besides new york you have to like 

135.54 139.95 B: drive everywhere to go so like walking is like really you know you can't really walk to go anywhere 

140.15 140.62 A: right 

141.00 142.19 B: yeah so 

142.01 144.88 A: well i'm in texas you can pretty much walk everywhere 

144.63 145.67 B: oh okay 

145.78 150.09 B: because i used to live in new york and i used to walk everywhere take the train you know that was good exercise for me 

150.44 150.91 A: right 

151.47 151.89 B: yeah 

152.03 152.64 B: well i've nev- 

152.04 153.37 A: yeah i've got a friend from new york 

153.76 155.16 B: yeah i've never like um 

153.89 154.37 A: yeah 

155.26 156.56 B: just recently it snowed 

156.83 158.46 B: here yesterday but i've never really 

158.60 162.32 B: tried any outside snowing sports like skiing or anything like that 

163.18 167.79 A: yeah my thing with the skiing i'm always afraid i'd be the one that would break their leg or something 

168.43 169.90 A: because that just seems like a dangerous 

170.01 172.01 A: sport that you can't control once your going down 

172.21 177.14 B: yeah exactly and that's like for the adventurous person i'm not really like into that kind of thing either 

177.00 177.45 A: right 

177.77 179.51 A: or like the rock climbing kind of thing 

179.97 182.50 B: yeah in the summertime we i like going to the beach and stuff 

183.19 183.67 A: yeah 

183.90 185.81 B: there's a lot of activities you can do there 

186.32 189.05 A: right where i live there's not a lot of beaches there's some 

189.27 190.48 A: nasty lakes 

190.66 191.04 A: but 

191.54 192.00 A: you know 

192.33 193.87 A: we do play volleyball after 

194.03 194.53 A: church 

194.66 195.94 A: and stuff like that that's kind of fun 

196.24 197.23 B: oh okay well 

196.76 197.94 A: because you could be out there and 

198.15 200.02 A: you know it gets you motivated or whatever 

200.33 201.08 B: oh that's nice 

201.35 204.06 B: i live in apartment building and they have a pool right across 

204.22 206.58 B: from my apartment building so we can just go and swim 

207.33 208.48 A: oh that would be nice 

208.78 209.32 B: yeah 

208.93 210.13 A: i wish i was close to a 

210.67 213.98 A: a pool because swimming just to tone up because i love to swim 

214.55 217.14 A: plus you're in the water and the water's normally cool 

217.67 218.43 B: yeah 

218.54 220.58 A: and it also provides that resistance too 

220.98 221.44 B: uh huh 

223.00 223.52 A: hmm 

223.80 225.74 A: i wish i had a pool but no 

226.54 230.02 A: i just basically got to cheap do the cheap stuff and then walking and 

230.28 231.51 A: running and all that other stuff 

232.22 232.66 B: yeah 

235.83 239.44 B: i wonder how long this conversation is supposed to go on for i'm like thinking in my mind 

239.59 240.36 A: i don't know 

241.08 241.75 B: oh okay 

241.87 243.33 A: that's the only thing is they (( the only )) 

243.43 244.34 A: tell us anything 

245.11 245.65 A: about it 

246.40 251.22 B: yeah that's what i was trying to figure out maybe they're probably going to tell you if they're recording or something when to stop 

252.92 254.08 A: well i don't know 

254.43 254.94 B: (( we need )) 

254.48 256.08 A: i mean all it said was participate 

256.73 257.20 A: you know 

257.60 258.17 A: in a 

258.74 262.93 A: in a survey but it never did say like when you're done or anything like that you know press this or 

263.15 265.16 B: oh how did you sign up for the survey 

263.69 264.29 A: or not 

265.57 265.96 A: huh 

266.00 267.99 B: how did you sign up did you find out about the survey 

268.04 269.39 A: um one of my friends sent me 

269.50 270.36 A: an email about it 

270.77 271.72 B: oh okay so she 

271.31 272.11 A: (( )) 

272.46 274.98 B: and she did it and she told you about it or she just 

274.69 279.72 A: no she just said there would that there was a survey thing out there if i would be interested i don't know if she signed up or not 

280.04 280.75 B: oh okay because 

280.38 281.73 A: but i went ahead and signed up 

281.71 286.01 B: because this is like the first survey that i did that's actually on the phone usually i do online surveys 

287.36 287.86 B: and 

287.50 288.87 A: well this is my first one period 

289.22 290.12 B: oh okay 

290.94 294.17 A: but i don't know i mean it didn't in like the directions it just said you'll be receiving a call 

294.64 295.27 B: yeah i know 

294.64 300.65 A: to participate in a survey but it didn't say anything like you'd be talking to anyone else i just figured it would be something like you press the tone or 

300.99 303.32 B: yeah i thought yeah me too i didn't know 

303.67 304.73 B: (( )) about it either 

305.08 305.44 A: yeah 

305.82 309.38 A: but i don't know how you i mean i don't know when it's going to end or anything like that i mean 

310.04 312.48 A: outdoor activities yeah you can 

313.38 315.40 A: talk about a lot of stuff but i mean 

315.92 319.80 B: yeah but like yeah you you don't know wh- where to take it from afterwards and when it's going to end 

320.19 320.65 A: yeah 

320.84 322.03 B: yeah that's the thing 

322.31 323.69 A: so that i mean plus 

323.95 327.59 A: if somebody doesn't enjoy any activities at all indoor or outdoor 

327.96 329.29 A: cold or hot 

329.79 333.17 B: yeah i think that they said if you wasn't interested in the topic you could just you know 

333.57 337.15 B: not take answer because they ask they tell you the topic and if you're interested 

337.34 338.93 B: to put in your pin number or whatever 

339.25 339.72 A: yeah 

340.08 342.98 B: yeah and i think like they pay you ten dollars per survey or something like that 

343.31 344.42 A: that's what they said 

344.83 349.41 B: yeah i d- i don't know really anybody this is something new i don't anybody who really actually done it 

349.95 350.69 A: i don't either 

351.08 356.12 A: she just got it sent to her and i guess she just forwarded it to me i mean i think it's a cool concept but i mean i 

351.11 351.68 B: oh 

356.24 357.87 A: i don't know i just figured there would be like 

358.62 359.88 A: i just figured they would like 

360.03 362.14 A: talk to you and ask other little things 

362.39 363.09 A: do you enjoy this 

363.18 364.96 A: bored or that's bored 

364.86 368.00 B: yeah exactly so you'd know where to go but they're not really saying anything 

368.19 369.78 A: uh uh they're not doing anything at all 

370.23 371.01 B: oh okay 

371.23 374.11 A: i mean i like basketball and volleyball and 

374.63 378.28 A: stuff like that but you know i mean i don't know like really what they're 

379.80 380.26 B: yeah 

379.89 380.58 A: they're wanting 

380.98 381.95 B: yeah exactly 

381.78 385.58 A: i mean the majority of that is outdoor activities but i just don't like to be 

386.16 389.45 A: an outdoor activity in a hundred degree weather which in texas 

390.12 390.57 B: yeah 

390.62 393.15 A: happens a lot or you could be snowing one day 

390.70 391.11 B: (( it's weird )) 

393.83 397.11 A: be seventy degrees the next and then the next day it could be 

397.37 397.90 A: you know 

398.44 399.71 A: windy and freezing 

400.28 401.62 B: yeah that's true 

401.45 404.63 A: so that's the only thing with the activities is you have to plan around the weather 

405.26 405.72 B: yeah 

405.98 406.61 B: exactly 

407.95 418.56 B: well i don't really drive so it's like hard for me to like basically i have to wait for my husband to go anywhere and basically i just go to the gym and like i said i live in apartment buildings and wherever you got to go you got to drive 

418.83 419.32 A: right 

419.50 424.09 B: yeah so walking is like basically i mean when i used to live in new york i used to walk everywhere 

424.53 424.96 A: right 

425.14 425.58 B: yeah 

426.04 429.67 A: i wonder if there's an area around there that you can walk around your apartment complex 

429.63 435.54 B: yeah that's that's what my husband was saying but i was laughing i was like we look really weird just walking up and down the apartment complex 

436.23 436.74 A: yeah 

437.55 437.88 B: yeah 

437.60 439.84 A: sometimes some of those little places have little trails 

440.34 442.02 B: yeah they do walking trails 

442.23 442.64 A: yeah 

442.96 445.95 B: i like uh i went actually horse back riding recently 

446.22 446.64 A: mhm 

446.58 448.99 B: that was my first time and it was really nice 

448.84 449.86 A: oh that's cool 

450.09 450.46 B: yeah 

450.50 451.62 A: were you sore 

451.69 454.53 B: no not really it was really good we had like and instructor 

454.76 456.41 B: and everyone had their own horses 

457.00 459.25 B: and he was like telling us what to like which 

459.45 460.81 B: way to pull the horse you know 

461.19 463.16 B: thing the strings or whatever they call it 

463.32 463.80 A: mhm 

463.85 465.29 B: and to adjust the horse 

465.46 468.35 B: that if you pull it right it would go left it would turn left and whatever 

469.14 470.10 A: oh that's cool 

470.17 476.46 B: yeah so that was like the first time i ever did it but my husband he never like at that time i wasn't married so he never did anything like that 

476.95 477.52 A: right 

478.01 478.33 B: yeah 

478.94 479.90 A: oh that's cool 

480.32 481.78 B: yeah that's that's really fun 

482.37 485.67 A: yeah i'd like to go horse back riding but some of the stables up here it's just so 

486.11 489.49 A: it's so hard to get in with their hours and then to pay for it 

489.81 491.66 B: oh okay actually we went on a trip 

491.79 492.65 B: on a class trip 

493.49 496.01 B: that's how we got yeah it was like fifty dollars and i 

496.16 499.62 B: it not only includes horse back riding like boating and all that stuff 

500.09 501.11 A: oh that's pretty cool 

501.09 505.12 B: yeah outdoor activities and included dinner at a restaurant and everything so it was like 

505.47 506.22 B: pretty nice 

506.94 508.00 A: oh that's cool 

508.10 508.94 B: yeah 

508.81 512.62 A: yeah i think that would be fun because you don't you're not on your feet really 

512.79 513.30 B: uh huh 

513.00 517.10 A: i mean you get to go a little faster but you still get to see the scenery outside 

517.39 518.52 B: yeah exactly 

518.00 523.67 A: and it's good you know it's good activity and then like if it were to start raining you could really 

523.45 524.60 B: yeah 

524.21 525.98 A: go go faster faster 

526.86 527.23 B: yeah 

527.68 539.19 B: well we was lucky the w- weather was really nice when we had to do it the only thing like when we went horse back riding there was a particular trail that you had to go through through the woods or whatever and it was like really stink because the horse dung was on the floor 

527.81 528.20 A: yeah 

536.03 536.53 A: mhm 

539.71 540.82 A: oo 

539.77 540.12 B: but i 

540.46 545.06 B: yeah but we of of course we're not walking on it it's the horse that's walking on it 

543.86 544.47 A: right 

544.90 546.94 A: but still you got to smell all that 

546.72 547.59 B: yeah that's a really 

547.88 548.98 A: eh 

547.94 550.92 B: that's the only that's the only down part about it other than that it's really fun 

551.18 551.68 A: yeah
