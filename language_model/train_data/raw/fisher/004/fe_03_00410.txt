104.54 113.82 A: oh well this is my first time too but i think the essential thing is they're gi- what they're doing is at at the linguistics lab is that they're they're trying to see how people 

111.15 111.70 B: right 

114.40 120.66 A: i think they're trying to to to to see how people converse when they've just met each other like you kn- you know how 

121.47 131.62 A: how if you know two people who don't know each other how they in a conversation go about getting to know each other or going about talking about a conversation where they don't know each other i'm not sure exactly what it is i think we just need to talk about the 

131.95 133.23 A: the topic and 

133.82 137.26 A: that's it i don't know we just converse on that topic and see where it leads

138.26 139.07 A: um 

138.38 142.12 B: well i tell you what i say at the elementary level 

142.46 145.34 B: the opportunities for students and children who in some 

145.70 149.81 B: uh households and income levels wh- who would never have an opportunity 

150.42 153.24 B: to provide them children with the 

153.46 156.96 B: uh computer backup and setup that they have in the schools 

157.41 159.71 B: is so enormous and the interest that 

159.41 159.94 A: yeah 

159.91 167.83 B: they uh give children you know they have a opportunity to share with other students even in the higher level the secondary levels 

168.33 171.99 B: the sharing of the computers and sharing of the educational levels 

172.68 173.91 B: uh the interest 

173.47 174.34 A: right 

174.02 177.16 B: encouraging the interest i think is so fantastic 

177.58 180.39 A: well where where do you work uh what school 

179.23 181.04 B: montgomery county public schools 

181.21 182.07 A: which one

192.42 193.07 B: right 

193.82 196.11 B: well that's a fine educational 

196.25 197.01 B: place 

197.37 198.07 B: uh 

197.56 203.30 A: it is it -ell it's interesting i um i'm not that familiar with the public (( sen- uh )) i know the public schools in philadelphia are 

203.56 208.18 A: are struggling compared to i went to high school you know just an hour outside the city and um 

209.34 215.55 A: um in the suburbs and we had what was supposed to be one of the like the fourth best school in the country and there's so much um 

215.73 222.71 A: there are so many financial resources and so many resources for the kids at that school compared to what i've heard in the public schools of philadelphia i haven't gotten a chance to 

223.27 223.70 B: well 

223.31 227.69 A: to really explore that (( resources there )) in philadelphia yet but i'm curious because it's it's you know 

228.29 230.69 A: big issue in philadelphia especially with um 

228.51 228.92 B: sure 

231.04 231.67 A: the um 

232.08 234.06 A: what was it edison that took over the school system 

234.36 234.96 A: last year 

234.40 234.80 B: right 

235.09 235.55 B: right 

235.79 236.25 A: right 

236.65 240.43 B: well in montgomery county we used to be the number one school system 

240.30 241.49 A: really 

240.85 245.25 B: uh still a very high um high percentage um 

245.29 248.59 B: (( was )) and and some of our schools and several of our schools 

248.77 253.84 B: i would say that ninety nine percent of the students go on with a college education 

254.17 260.59 B: and are all honor students and probably the highest number of of honors courses taught in a 

260.72 263.36 B: particular school system are right here in montgomery county 

263.53 264.79 A: right right 

263.71 271.21 B: so it's it's well known but then fairfax county and some of the other counties have come along and caught up with us but montgomery county 

271.59 274.37 B: is well known for its education system 

274.49 280.37 A: well i guess it's good that other people are are catching up but so the comp- the i gu- (( )) to stay on topic that the computers 

280.49 283.92 A: uh kind of computer classes are good availability 

291.28 293.48 B: and there's no doubt about it that the computer 

291.43 292.05 A: right 

293.79 297.48 B: has made the educational system so much finer for students 

294.06 294.52 A: right 

297.54 299.34 A: right you know that's interesting i had 

298.12 299.13 B: uh 

299.47 303.57 A: i had a debate with a college professor of mine who actually thought that 

304.41 308.88 A: well -cause we asked him if he thought like in the computer age if papers at a high level were 

308.88 313.00 A: better or worse than they were before and he actually thought they were worse because he thought people 

313.27 318.36 A: didn't have to think as hard about what they were writing because you can just sort of write and manipulate and and and 

317.75 319.26 B: right true that's true 

318.48 325.19 A: cut and paste and you didn't have to deliberate as much before you put something on paper and that p- you know what i mean which i thought was an interesting theory 

324.30 328.73 B: yeah but there are students out there who still want to express and use their own ideas 

328.84 330.09 B: and and 

329.00 329.69 A: right 

329.80 330.15 A: right 

330.34 330.86 B: and 

331.36 333.77 B: function with their own thoughts and ideas 

333.83 334.65 A: right right 

333.85 336.09 B: so and but it and it gives them more time 

336.44 340.12 B: uh more opportunity to be able to put it all there 

336.77 337.17 A: right 

340.55 342.91 B: so i i think it's a great help myself 

340.84 341.29 A: right 

343.30 345.89 B: i can't imagine what we ever did without them 

343.44 343.97 A: right 

346.39 347.93 A: no i mean i i obviously can't 

348.11 350.87 A: can't fathom it i mean my mother talks about when she used to write 

351.39 352.50 A: used to type up for par- 

352.68 357.44 A: you know for part time money she used to type up other people's dissertations on the c- on the typewriter and you know it used to be one 

354.98 356.43 B: right exactly 

357.79 361.13 A: one word incorrect and you sort of had to go back and start from scratch 

359.94 366.23 B: exactly i remember that so much when i first started working for the system which is probably thirty years ago 

366.47 367.21 B: uh 

366.51 367.04 A: mhm 

367.33 377.30 B: if you made a mistake and you had to tape and right now the only disadvantage is and this is what i see in your problem now folks rewrite and rewrite 

377.72 385.18 B: whereas before you wrote it and that was it now if pre- if you're working your boss decides to change his mind fifty thousand times 

385.59 387.67 B: it's easy to change 

385.62 389.70 A: true true i i worked in a uh in a law firm and um 

390.16 392.45 A: one tiny little thing (( )) 

397.39 399.36 B: right exactly 

398.63 405.65 A: seven floors down make the little correction print it out seven floors back up and you know it was somewhat unproductive and at the 

405.88 413.15 B: so that's the only disadvantage is folks keep changing their mind i don't know that that's bad but it certainly does um 

413.82 414.77 B: string out 

415.61 416.06 A: right 

416.16 417.55 B: you know stretch it out more 

417.93 418.34 B: what 

418.20 418.59 A: right 

418.46 423.33 B: that's an advantage but it's also a disadvantage if you have a small operation 

423.56 426.71 B: and you want to keep changing your thoughts and your ideas and 

423.99 424.38 A: mhm 

427.10 427.59 B: and 

428.37 429.80 B: that would be a disadvantage 

434.70 436.58 B: no no no no 

439.37 445.92 B: i think also i don't know how you feel about it but i think also the fact that that we're constantly changing constantly changing 

446.20 447.54 B: i think it's unnecessary 

448.06 450.69 B: i don't believe we need to have to upgrade yes 

449.23 451.49 A: oh the computers you know like u- up update it uh like 

451.27 451.69 B: yeah 

451.89 455.81 A: bringing up the technology you know it's true it the technology is outdated so quickly 

451.92 452.45 B: yeah 

456.01 458.94 B: right i mean it's out outdated and it's a costly thing 

459.32 460.82 B: uh so i think they could 

461.08 463.99 B: refrain from some of that that we really could 

464.17 466.75 B: carry on with some of those that we have without 

466.92 468.81 B: the new changes so frequently 

469.57 470.48 A: true that's a 

469.57 470.70 B: but you know 

471.32 472.12 B: it's cau- it 

471.41 477.61 A: you get spoiled though you get then like when i went to college i got so used to having the latest and greatest and the quickest connections and 

477.30 478.55 B: oh yes well that's 

478.12 482.60 A: and then i go and i went to work in a in a law firm and all the computers were way outdated and i couldn't 

482.77 485.32 A: stand it i i it just drove me absolutely insane 

484.88 488.02 B: i mean you know everywhere you go someone has some other 

488.13 497.27 B: of type it's using some other method some other file so it's constantly changing you have to constantly keep updated or you're lost 

492.24 492.70 A: mhm 

493.16 493.53 A: right 

497.71 498.25 A: yeah 

498.33 503.81 B: so i i guess it's good from that standpoint but i think it's also a disadvantage it's a cost feature 

504.61 509.82 A: it is it's true i mean it is a like it's a it's a huge industry a lot of people are you know making their living of it i suppose 

509.07 510.25 B: yes yes 

510.47 510.92 A: as much as 

510.51 514.04 B: so the pros and cons are yes it it's tough 

514.62 515.13 A: yeah 

516.03 519.73 A: yeah i mean there th- th- at this point there's no going back but really it's it's amazing to me like the 

516.07 516.53 B: (( so )) 

519.90 521.43 A: how some people really don't like just 

521.92 526.64 A: the bits of computer education i did get in high school like just li- how to learn how to use the um 

527.02 530.49 A: the home keys how to type without looking at the keyboard things that i took for granted 

530.58 531.69 B: (( why it's testing )) 

530.76 533.99 A: i see other people uh you know grew up a lot of adults but also like 

532.02 532.57 B: yeah 

534.34 543.94 A: my my boyfriend was from india and he could- he could only type with his two fingers looking at the keyboard and that's something i realized you know it's a i- it's an immense advantage for me just to even be able it's like a whole 

544.19 547.29 A: -nother language i mean my father's the same way he has to type with his fingers 

547.48 552.34 B: well my son's the same way and let me tell you we do a first class when we do something on 

548.39 549.07 A: and look at it 

552.45 553.75 B: m._s._n. or something 

554.16 555.12 B: he's got hi- 

554.28 556.32 A: you do what what do you call it did you say you had first class 

556.58 557.06 B: yes 

557.40 559.00 A: oh we had first class in college 

559.17 564.21 B: right but i mean i'm i'm using that for an example i (( )) first class or something like that 

562.28 562.94 A: mhm
