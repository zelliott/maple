310.35 311.55 A: go to the military 

311.62 312.07 B: mhm 

312.19 315.41 A: and i mean it's just everybody just decides to do their own thing

320.75 321.27 B: yeah 

322.11 323.41 B: i think after college it's a lot 

323.57 325.52 B: it's a lot harder to meet new people too because 

326.13 327.11 B: it's like you got to 

327.24 333.52 B: you got to go out and you got to make an effort but like when you're here there peop- there new people all over the place i mean you're living in a dorm 

332.14 332.65 A: uh-huh 

333.61 336.37 A: and you can't walk five feet without running into somebody 

335.47 335.97 B: yeah 

336.53 337.28 B: right so 

338.27 340.97 B: yeah it's it's a lot different after after you get out of school 

341.99 342.65 A: it is 

343.55 346.22 A: i don't know just like i haven't met too many people recently except for

355.05 356.68 A: i don't know people that at work 

357.32 359.70 A: just that's about it though i haven't met too many new people 

360.73 361.73 A: just i don't know 

362.39 363.65 A: getting older it just gets harder
