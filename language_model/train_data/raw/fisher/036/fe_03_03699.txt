74.49 80.31 B: ah i definitely don't see how you're gonna you're gonna [noise] support barely one person 

81.09 84.16 B: it's it's it is crazy isn't it 

84.25 97.75 A: i i i don't know if it is that is that the way they they expect people to ah live or is this ah considered a base wage people are just gonna you know people in like the fifth you know ages fifteen through i don't know eighteen are supposed to be making this or 

97.36 101.18 B: no no five that's minimum wage is what the minimum they have to pay you 

101.13 111.58 A: oh i know but i'm i'm just i was just wondering who who decided that's a good idea to pay people that i mean people can people can barely survive on that i don't think it's a a great idea 

101.20 103.01 B: to work 

106.67 108.60 B: congress 

111.01 116.57 B: it's congress think about this do you know where they're being paid work less is ah servers [sigh] 

116.67 122.57 A: oh yeah th- i saw that in the ah paper today i was looking for jobs and two thirty three plus tips 

120.17 122.33 B: (( [noise] ah yeah )) 

122.43 128.32 B: yup yup yup so if you're in a good placed shift you're gonna get money but if you're in a slow place you're screwed 

128.34 130.06 A: yeah 

129.25 139.31 B: you know it's getting crazy out there well the way they see it is if they raise the rate then less people have jobs and less money flows 

139.57 149.73 B: but ah i don't know 'cause i tell you i've seen i get people coming in who have like three kids and ah they're barely making like thirteen grand a year 

150.12 153.05 B: (( i don't know how a family can do that )) 

152.37 156.39 A: yeah that's ah close to starvation level there 

155.42 157.05 B: (( pretty much )) 

157.09 159.22 B: (( that's why they get the in- income credit )) 

160.04 166.63 B: ah yeah i'm hoping they'll have raised the minimum wage some day soon i'm just in 

165.71 173.65 A: yeah that would be certainly nice if they did but i don't know but what's considering ah considered a i've heard the term here a lot ah a living wage 

173.13 174.16 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

174.12 180.31 A: is that that's considered i think ah i don't know like maybe twenty or twenty five a year i think 

179.56 190.99 B: that i could yeah that's about what i'd could see a year even twenty thousand would be a little better anyway even you know like military some of those guys make barely minimum wage [noise] 

190.90 200.73 A: military ah yeah that i can see that too but military your at least at the very least you're getting i mean that's not that that's still a it's still a pretty bad wage but in the military at least you're given 

201.01 202.88 A: room and board i mean 

203.25 204.24 B: (( [noise] true )) 

203.79 210.78 A: if you're doing minimum wage outside of something like that you gotta provide yourself with food and living and then on top of that 

209.04 214.46 B: but i'm talking like let's take a private who's married has a kid 

214.47 217.21 B: so he's getting a little basic allowance 

217.32 220.06 B: but they still well 

219.46 223.59 A: oh they still only make ah minimum wa- at five fifteen an hour 

223.43 225.05 B: they make about 

225.20 232.16 B: [lipsmack] see they the guys i've seen come through my s- place they get about thirteen to twenty grand a year 

232.23 234.32 A: ah that's just not [laughter] 

233.83 236.00 B: [laughter] that's why ah 

236.32 245.29 B: [cough] have you have you seen on the news when they've been doing those ads about if you ah loved one's in the military and you're having financial problems to call the the j._a._g. outfit 

244.95 246.68 A: mhm 

245.62 251.92 B: 'cause they have a lot of people when they were called back into service for the war as they say um 

252.48 266.81 B: were making way more in their civilian life than they were making in their military life and when and when they go back to the s- to the military they loose their civilian pay 'cause they have to keep you're job but they don't have to pay you 

258.01 259.86 A: [noise] oh i can see that 

266.85 273.88 A: yeah not only that but they also yeah you if you have a business or something or anything that requires ah a 

272.89 274.98 B: (( [noise] yep [lipsmack] )) 

274.00 277.94 A: commitment [noise] then those things are basically ah done 

278.04 288.45 B: yep so yeah they they really need to fix minimum wage i mean real wage should really be probably seven to eight dollars an hour that would w- 

287.32 293.79 A: that would be ah that would be definitely much more ah acceptable for the you know population at large but 

292.60 295.56 B: only then i wouldn't even work for that little when i was eighteen 

295.89 305.84 A: yeah i i have to say i don't think i've ever worked minimum wage in my life either i think ah lowest i ever started at was six fifty seven and that was you know like seven years ago or so 

296.97 299.69 B: [laughter] 

305.63 311.20 B: th- there's not many places you see that really do pay minimum wage but there are still a few 

311.17 320.60 A: yeah i'd have to say that i'd i see 'em out there advertised and i mean i aside from that i i don't see what the benefit of any of those those places would be most of them don't offer any sort of ah 

321.41 324.00 A: you know great room for advancement or ah 

323.08 337.50 B: grunt work is what gets the minimum wage and they're the one's that are getting screwed actually people who people who don't have an education all they can do is grunt work they're the ones laborers i should say they're the ones that get minimum wage and they're the ones that need the most money usually 

326.89 328.72 A: which ones 

330.76 331.62 A: oh 

336.69 343.90 A: true but i i think that that's mostly that even um i think the trades are usually a a pretty good place to go i mean if you 

343.02 352.68 B: well i don't mean skilled labor i mean labor like lawn care moving heavy objects 

345.71 346.61 A: okay 

347.32 349.44 A: just general ah maybe in the 

352.81 355.98 B: ah warehouse work 

355.19 357.06 A: the service industry kind of 

356.35 359.22 B: right they usually do 

359.19 361.87 A: [noise] yeah i definitely see that i ah 

362.20 368.96 A: i'm in college right now actually and i'm i've been looking for ah jobs for the summer and i'm i'm looking somewhere between you know 

368.98 373.14 A: i don't know anywhere between ten and fifteen an hour is what i'm i'm looking for 

372.63 374.93 B: (( [noise] [noise] and it's hard to find isn't it )) 

374.30 384.71 A: it's it's hard to find it but i i have to say if i if i i don't even think twice about something that's five you know between five six seven dollars an hour is not that doesn't cut it for me and i'm you know [laughter] 

384.31 387.42 B: [noise] yup [noise] well what 

385.54 387.97 A: i've got of other things to support myself with 

387.95 396.07 B: luckily some of the other some jobs are i you know like fast food and things these days aren't paying minimum wage which is good 

395.57 397.13 A: yeah that is definitely 

396.43 405.11 B: most of them pay around eight to nine dollars in our area at least i've noticed but so it's not too bad there but it's the ones who you know 

406.56 412.88 B: [noise] who need a lot lot of working overtime and you know the grunt the lowest level worker 

412.91 417.20 B: and that's who they do the five the you know five something an hour and 

417.26 419.38 B: it's just not cool 

418.70 422.16 A: yeah that just doesn't allow ah room for ah survival 

421.48 429.85 B: it [noise] no not at all that's where mom and dad are both working you had to get a paper round just to buy your comics [laughter] 

424.33 425.03 A: (( [noise] )) 

429.79 430.65 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

430.52 431.19 B: it 

431.53 443.41 B: get's pretty bad so you know you gotta remember th- who's making the laws it's congress and you know they sit up there you know we gotta do budget cuts but hey let's give ourselves a raise 

443.04 445.04 A: yeah exactly 

443.99 446.78 B: (( [noise] but we won't get minimum wage raised because )) 

446.85 450.11 B: our high priced friends who need cheap labor 

450.16 451.32 B: will get mad [noise] 

451.31 456.87 A: well i hear common a common excuse is for that too is that while we can't increase minimum wage because then 

456.89 462.91 A: the ah companies will have to pay out more and then that will slow down the economy but it it what strikes me is that um 

462.96 469.26 A: today's age is m- motivated more by um you know consumer than ah survival 

467.45 472.71 B: [noise] right is that right you so you pay them more but they'll spend more 

472.26 474.54 A: exactly exactly i i don't see how it 

473.43 483.66 B: and then they'll go in the and we'll go we'll [noise] and then they government will have to pay out more and it'll end up coming out back in the long run but no one sees the big picture [noise] 

481.76 483.44 A: mhm 

484.30 486.93 B: they see the quick fix 

487.06 495.41 B: unfortunately see you know you you raise it up fifty cents to seventy five and everybody's happy whoo hoo you know and [noise] that's about it 

488.61 489.72 A: (( ah definitely )) 

495.34 497.99 A: i definitely do see that as a as a difficulty 

497.79 507.14 B: yeah [laughter] it's cause it's the people who use the the the cheap labor are the ones making sure it doesn't get more expensive 

507.08 514.85 A: i see too that the um gap between the rich and the poor i mean has increased steadily since you know nineteen 

513.20 514.95 B: (( [noise] [noise] oh oh )) 

515.00 517.40 A: nineteen fifties i think is where the um 

517.62 527.12 A: quality of living index ah adjusted you know over time is was the highest for people was right after the post war era and since then it's steadily declined 

525.93 529.04 B: [noise] yeah yeah there's there in times there's big gaps again 

530.05 537.10 B: from a you know buh there's not even a big gap between just a few of them really there's big gap between all of 'em 

536.68 538.42 A: mhm 

537.55 543.70 B: so there's a big gap between the the the poor the middle class and there's a huge gap between the middle class and the rich 

543.67 549.83 A: and also the the middle class seems to be ah um becoming s- progressively smaller 

549.38 560.55 B: true true yeah well yeah ah yeah if you really there's a lot of places you gotta be making ah you know sixty grand a year or more if you want to have kids and raise them in most cities 

560.71 565.60 A: yeah and people are working l- longer hours and ah are you know putting in 

563.52 564.58 B: (( that's it so )) 

564.93 568.88 B: longer hours less vacations less money yup 

567.67 569.76 A: sixty seventy hours a week and then 

569.09 570.06 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

569.85 573.59 A: people wonder why they can't spend time with their children and 

572.65 573.63 B: yup 

573.71 576.58 B: it's crazy isn't it 

575.81 577.19 A: (( yeah it's kinda fun )) 

578.91 579.95 B: (( i don't know )) 

578.93 580.61 A: yeah 

580.05 589.70 B: [noise] maybe it'll get fixed some day we shall see but yeah i i was i hear that they might be raising the the minimum wage soon but probably not gonna be by much 

590.06 597.64 A: ah every time it seems that there's something up for um you know a a significant increase like a dollar or more it just just just falls apart 

597.87 599.89 A: i mean people don't want to you know they won't
