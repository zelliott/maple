103.49 107.88 B: ab- absolutely um you know g- i- if you if you have if you you 

107.76 120.50 B: know simply going to work the commuting costs in going to work cost quite a bit you know own a car and pay for gas and the gas prices is the last few months have g- have ah skyrocketed quite a bit 

119.65 126.21 A: that's right i mean i mean i used to i used to work like since i graduated from high school that was about a year and a half ago 

126.07 137.05 A: (( i worked for a g._m. company a branch you know detroit i used to get paid like about ah eleven bucks an hour that was very good to me but it's like after two months i got laid off )) 

137.12 140.10 A: (( and that was just because of the economic )) 

140.28 146.28 A: and it's like what they have right now for unemployment they don't even pay you fifty percent what you used to get i 

146.43 150.28 A: mean it's i could barely pay my phone bill right now 

149.82 156.15 B: y- understand ah how the cost of living ah d- do you actually live right in right in detroit 

156.34 165.69 A: yeah i live in detroit but i'm like i'm living with a someone else right now a friend of mine to share some payments with him but 'cause my with- 

166.26 167.57 B: understand yeah 

166.64 170.19 A: without that friend it would be very difficult to get through 

171.10 180.25 B: i- it's um i- i- well th- that's what you know that's where you have to you know if the if the um minimum wage doesn't keep up people have to get creative 

180.24 186.37 B: to help defray costs and i hear what you said you you it sounds like you're you know sharing costs um 

185.58 186.55 A: that's right 

187.05 196.66 B: and that's what i know i just moved into a a a new house here i'm renting a house from a friend and ah um it's not exactly where i want to live um but 

196.09 198.27 A: but you just have to right 

197.63 211.33 B: yeah i just have to yeah it's it's it's absolutely true and you know you've gotta you know more and more these days your counting your your your pennies and you know really taking into account where you spend your money you have to be very careful 

210.67 221.86 A: but but what i'm thinking right now i i'm saying it's like before we think about like raising the minimum wage we should be like thinking of ways to get offer more jobs like create more jobs 

221.94 226.78 A: before we could like raise the wages because you if you don't even have a job it 

227.21 231.51 A: even not get things even if the wages go up there's like no 

231.53 234.86 A: for some of us who are laid off right now 

235.01 239.42 A: so basically there should be a way to create jobs before we 

239.61 242.38 A: create or make high wages 

243.18 248.55 B: well th- that that would probably help too to get right to to to create more opportunities 

248.57 256.43 B: to ah for people who are out of work i know the the u- you know the unemployment's rising right now and it just seems like that's um 

256.96 270.21 B: [lipsmack] you know that a con- that's a you know function of people you know companies trying to get by with fewer workers and and that you know that's again- that you know the now to think of it that's a that's a problem i don't know if that's gonna you know um 

262.58 263.71 A: that's right 

270.24 275.59 B: you know encourage encourage the country ah companies to pay ah lay off more people 

275.35 287.45 B: um that's the only thing i'm i would be a- afraid of but um you know in these in these times i- it you know people working are working hard and i i i know f- i have a lot of friends who 

287.55 300.85 B: you know are putting in their time and are working hard and ah ah you know i i think it's only fair that you you're you know you get a fair wage for a fair day ah you know fairs day fair day work mm 

297.51 298.18 A: well 

298.47 304.24 A: you're right i mean like even some of my friends who are not even taking their yearly vacation annual vacation 

303.97 305.16 B: mhm 

304.61 315.61 A: they're not even taking their vacations just to save some money and keep the from they get laid off or lose their jobs i mean it's really getting harder and harder there doing i hope 

315.99 317.71 A: it'll improve in the future 

318.00 324.37 B: that it it's frustrating what you you had said earlier you worked for a g._m. company did um 

322.78 328.79 A: yes a branch of a g._m. company the company but like we used to be a warehouse for parts 

328.79 330.21 B: yes okay 

329.27 336.20 A: and deliver them all over the world but a- as i said it's like lasted only three months and i got laid off it's i mean 

335.87 340.52 B: it's it's it's tough that's when you really feel it yeah is 

339.23 340.74 A: that's right i mean i'm 

340.86 351.98 A: i worked hard to get that job so i could like just after i graduated from high school and all that i just barely got that job and i'm just suddenly i'm out of it 

351.84 364.70 B: it is it is it your ah th- it has to do with the ah state of the eco- of you know the the actual ah you know the the car industry or um you know the the fact that you know the pa- you know the as you said you worked in a parts ah 

364.42 365.61 A: yeah that's right 

365.17 371.61 B: yeah and it ah you know i guess if the if the car industry is hurting a little bit then you know everything that feeds into it 

371.62 376.41 B: gets affected um i know in philadelphia here 

376.40 390.59 B: um you know the housing ah the m- housing costs have gone up quite a bit you know the houses the cost of houses have gone up and um that makes that ma- that makes things a lot tougher um and i and i've felt the pinch 

390.44 404.74 B: um and that's why i used to own a house i had to sell that and you know basically now i'm you know like i said earlier i'm living ah not exactly where i am but wh- not exactly where i want to be but um yeah you've got got to so 

404.60 406.99 A: yeah you've just gotta find a way out 

407.22 415.32 B: yeah e- e- e- exactly and um you know ah i you had mentioned nine eleven earlier i think that's ah in in 

414.60 417.59 A: i believe it's like the prime cause of it maybe 

417.74 428.55 B: i i i you know i think that's a it's a big thing it's made p- it's made ah everybody a little less confident in what you know going forward and especially the companies i think they've 

428.64 430.29 B: um you know they're 

429.43 440.94 A: but i mean i mean i lived in the u._s. like less than six years so i mean i came from iraq i was ah iraqi born there but i mean when i first came in ninety seven everything was going fine 

440.76 444.58 A: i mean there was a lot of jobs like almost like if you 

444.59 458.93 A: if you get if you quit your job or get fired from it you've got you've got a second day you find another job right now it took like three months to find another job then i get laid off and i'm still looking it's i mean after september eleven everything changed [noise] 

455.96 456.89 B: yeah 

459.58 472.59 B: are are y- you know you you had said you'd only been you have been here seven years are are you um less than seven years you're y- you know have you been disappointed or you know ex- expectations have not been met by 

464.17 465.64 A: (( yeah less than seven years )) 

471.84 480.37 A: yeah because like th- the prime cause like we came for the u._s. like the land of opportunity now it's like the the land of making me poor 

477.49 478.33 B: yes 

480.54 494.99 B: it's the land of making [laughter] i i i've never heard that one before but that's [laughter] that's ah it that's ah you know at this point it's it's it is it you know i th- in comparison you came over at a time i think when 

481.79 484.51 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

485.48 487.41 A: (( [laughter] )) 

494.87 497.88 B: you know things were going so well you know 

497.01 498.00 A: that's right 

498.07 499.66 B: and yeah everybody'd 

499.46 512.87 B: and then unfortunately i know i talk with my friends and every you know we all got kind of caught up in that you know that we thought things were gonna get better and better and you know everybody was gonna be making money like they always did during the nineteen nineties 

512.79 517.05 B: and you know it's not that's not the case now well here we are talking about 

516.92 530.98 B: you know ah trying to keep our heads above water and hoping that you know minimum wage um you know keeps up with you know our you know things that we want to do and just support you know for the necessities um it kind of 

530.06 539.01 A: i mean i j- i just want to say another thing it's like i mean the ma- the main thing is like ah i'm not employed i don't know it's like maybe because like i'm a student college student right now 

532.35 533.10 B: (( yeah )) 

538.45 539.31 B: sure 

539.01 547.77 A: and it's like it's difficult because it classes like the the most you could work maybe like twenty hours a week or something like that and it's like 

547.80 560.16 A: it's really hard to find like a part time job right now i thought maybe if i didn't if i didn't have to go to school maybe it would be easier to get a job but i mean would w- doing both at the same time it would be very difficult 

560.16 574.39 B: v- yeah very difficult and it an- and that that just shows you how much you know if you if you can only wo- if you can only work part time or only work twenty hours a week you want to make as much as you can and um i think it's important that um [lipsmack] 

574.79 578.39 B: that that there is a minimum a minimum wage so you do 

577.51 583.42 A: yeah that's right we've all come to the same point i mean some of the like part time's like if they raise the wages 

579.97 580.80 B: yeah 

583.28 584.17 B: right 

583.47 587.33 A: (( as i said maybe around six something like there that'll be just like )) 

587.47 594.17 A: making a lot of better like so even if you work like few hours you'll be making a a good cheque at least 

594.41 599.95 B: right you can you can t- take home enough to you know pay your rent and buy some food
