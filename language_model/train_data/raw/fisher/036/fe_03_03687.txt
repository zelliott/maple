0.06 1.97 A: (( hi my name is emmanuel )) 

0.06 1.56 B: hi my name is gene- 

1.64 3.19 B: my name is geneka 

3.44 5.00 A: hi geneka 

4.27 5.23 B: how are you 

5.22 6.32 A: i'm good you 

6.06 7.21 B: i'm good 

8.16 10.34 A: so this is an interesting topic 

8.22 9.66 B: um i yes 

9.98 11.91 B: i know [laughter] 

12.08 15.46 B: um it raised from five dollars to five fifteen 

15.78 17.79 B: i mean i still think that's pretty low 

17.82 20.35 B: i mean ah it should've been a bigger increase 

20.92 24.58 A: i have to agree with you who can live on five fifteen an hour 

24.60 27.39 B: i mean especially in today's economy number one 

27.37 40.33 B: with things being just so bad i mean i understand that you know fifteen cents to some is a big deal [laughter] but you know in in other in other things i don't think it is i mean like like a thirty cent raise maybe 

40.61 48.93 B: fifty cents i mean that i don't understand like the five fifteen should just make it like a round off number like or five fifty an hour or six dollars an hour 

48.97 52.37 B: [mn] i mean especially in today's market today's economy i think 

52.46 55.56 B: five fifteen is definitely not enough to live on at all 

56.14 61.49 A: i have to agree especially in some jobs you don't even get the five fifteen like if you 

61.58 69.85 A: um work in a restaurant in wait service they expect the tips to equal the five fifteen an hour your employer may only be paying you two dollars an hour 

69.58 82.38 B: right i mean so i mean i think in like a lot of markets like they're just kind of getting over really [laughter] because you know they figure okay like like you said you know in restaurants like i have a friend who works in a restaurant he makes three bucks an hour 

82.37 94.91 B: and then his tips you know kind of equal the rest and you know if you don't make tips you know if you don't have a good night you're only making three dollars an hour and then you know you've got to kind of support your family think about how many people in the restaurant business 

95.06 97.04 B: support your family and then 

97.12 106.55 B: you know you have big time restaurants who are you know benefitting off them only making three dollars an hour because you know they're putting the rest of the money in their pocket you know after everything you know 

107.60 112.56 A: another thing if the minimum wage was more people would be spending more money which would improve the economy 

112.77 115.03 B: definitely i think you know 

115.21 120.31 B: especially right now if people were spending a little bit more money [mn] then 

120.90 123.77 B: you know the economy would definitely be a lot better but i 

123.99 132.85 B: mean i work in a field right now where i run into people all the time you know saying that well hey look i can't do this because financial status i can't do that because of financial status 

132.86 138.52 B: i mean we're always looking for different ways to make money because of the fact that it's so low 

138.72 139.68 B: you know 

140.91 143.55 A: i know where i work we have a lot of people who 

143.64 148.56 A: [mn] um say they can't even live on minimum wage if they could get a minimum wage job 

148.95 150.07 B: yep 

150.22 158.22 B: i mean minimum wage jobs i mean you have to really think about it like this like so many of us don't want a minimum wage job because of the fact that we know it's going to be 

158.28 160.45 B: five to five fifteen an hour 

160.66 165.63 B: and then we're we're always looking for something more and then trying to look for something more they want 

165.65 176.77 B: you have to have a college degree you have to have a bachelor degree or associate degree and then with all that it's like you know you need money to go to college [laughter] you need college to make money 

176.36 180.62 A: (( [noise] that's right and if you're making five fifteen an hour you're not going to be able to afford to go to college )) 

180.19 184.68 B: there's just no way i mean you know i i tell people that i know now i'm like you know 

184.75 188.35 B: it's like you need a to get to b. and you need b. to get to c. it's like 

188.59 198.76 B: me now i'm struggling [laughter] right now for money and it's like you know you a need a car to have a good job you need a good job to pay for your car [laughter] 

199.01 205.59 B: and it's like you know one or the other and making five fifteen an hour is just not going to pay it especially when you have [mn] you know a family 

205.67 207.36 B: (( [mn] especially people nowadays )) 

207.40 215.87 B: you know who are getting laid off because of the economy people who you know are struggling just for that you know that little bit of money 

215.93 220.90 B: it- it's not going to happen especially making five fifteen an hour i mean i i think it's ridiculous 

222.12 224.15 A: i can't agree with you more 

223.59 230.85 B: [laughter] i mean you know i'm in a field now where money is definitely everything and people 

231.26 232.83 B: definitely you know 

233.02 235.39 B: depend on money to get them by i mean 

235.63 240.94 B: i mean thank goodness you know i don't have any children or anything to support making five fifteen an hour 

241.04 251.27 B: because i don't think i would be able to do it you know you see so many people out on the streets so many people are homeless and society is not is not taking it into consideration that it's only five fifteen an hour 

251.45 255.04 B: they're like oh well you know still pay your bills still do this still do that 

255.12 261.30 B: it's like you know your credit card companies are still going to call you the same time every month whether you get laid off or not 

261.80 276.67 B: and it's it's really ridiculous to know that we got to do this on five fifteen an hour and then we're not getting any type of leeway and [mn] trying to get you know financial help is just it's out the door like you have to be a certain minimum class just to get financial aid and 

276.75 281.54 B: you know [mn] i mean five fifteen an hour's definitely i don't i don't agree with it at all 

281.56 289.52 B: i mean i think it's ridiculous to just make something five fifteen an hour especially with the rising price of society i mean inflation is just 

289.72 290.95 B: it's just crazy 

291.16 296.78 A: [noise] exactly and how much gas is you're spending half of what you earn just getting t- to work and back 

296.49 299.21 B: yeah i mean i don't know whe- where are you from

304.40 308.93 B: so funny but i you guys got it a little bit better than new yorkers let me tell you 

309.07 314.41 B: because i run up to places right now where it's almost two dollars for for gas 

314.20 322.14 A: [laughter] yeah but going into the city seven dollars for the bridge that's over a dollar that's over one hour's worth of work if you make a minimum rate minimum wage [mn] 

319.47 320.43 B: oh yeah 

320.94 330.42 B: it's like it's like you know and then they've they're cutting hours you know it's like okay i'm making five fifteen an hour and i'm only working twenty hours a week or you're making 

329.41 334.21 A: i know what that's like i work at unemployment so i take the claims from everyone who has their hours cut 

333.82 337.89 B: yeah and i mean it's crazy it's like you know you you look at things on line where 

337.90 339.24 B: you have people 

339.51 344.73 B: walking on the sides of the road like i i'm an i. t. manager [laughter] and i need a job 

345.00 348.58 B: [cough] and it's and it's crazy you have these people who were making 

348.72 352.32 B: eighty thousand ninety thousand dollars a year who have been laid off 

352.56 359.47 B: and it's like now they have they have to go from making ninety thousand dollars a year a hundred thousand to five fifteen an hour 

352.65 353.38 A: yeah 

356.37 358.06 A: to five fifteen an hour 

358.86 362.48 A: and people still don't want to hire them because they say they're overqualified [laughter] 

361.77 367.80 B: exactly it's like oh you know you're overqualified like honestly i ran into that same problem i worked for horizon wireless 

367.85 373.91 B: and [mn] they just told me i was making like fifteen dollars an hour going down to now making nine 

374.04 379.56 B: because it's like you know you're it's the economy is so so bad right now 

379.66 385.92 B: and five fifteen an hour i i mean i don't know what to say five fifteen isn't ah it's just not sufficient 

385.93 388.27 B: it's either lower the price of living 

388.51 393.83 B: or raise the price of you know our work or create more jobs something mhm 

393.99 400.50 A: i know at at five fifteen an hour you've really got to work four full four full time jobs to make enough but that's 

400.64 403.29 A: thirty two hours and there's only twenty four hours in a day 

402.90 411.09 B: yep it's like you know it's like right now ah you know i work two jobs and i do bartending and you know i'm glad i kind of locked into my job 

411.08 419.00 B: you know before everything hit i'd been working at my job a couple of years and you know i started out making like when it was like four ninety five an hour [laughter] 

418.67 423.47 A: exactly an- and your tips got to make up the difference and if someone stiffs you on a tip 

422.09 422.80 B: right 

423.61 424.67 B: (( it's like you know )) 

423.88 426.42 A: you're out that money your boss isn't going to give it to you [laughter] 

426.08 433.65 B: yeah oh no definitely not and people and you know and it's like you've got to kind of understand that especially like if you work in a restaurant 

433.70 438.24 B: a people who come into a restaurant you know they're trying to save money as well 

438.48 443.55 B: you know but they have to remember that you know you're trying to live on that money that they're spending 

443.64 446.92 B: so it's like when you go to a restaurant and you know that you're in a budget 

447.06 450.64 B: you know you shouldn't order the priciest thing on the menu 

450.96 464.81 B: you know so so that way you can't leave a tip [laughter] and i have friends that do it all the time because i'm like you know i understand like i have a friend that works you know in ah this restaurant called da pablo's and the restaurant he makes three bucks [laughter] an hour 

464.86 470.73 B: and when people come in they're like oh you know i really can't leave that much tip you just he just bust his butt [mn] 

470.80 479.60 B: you know to work twelve thirteen hours to make maybe a hundred dollars to make mayb- you know what i mean 

479.52 484.42 A: exactly and that person will then go like now that person's making less than the minimum wage 

484.07 485.19 B: yeah 

485.67 488.17 B: and it's like you know it's like 

487.38 488.48 A: [noise] i don't have 

490.19 491.92 A: (( them [noise] look in the closet )) 

492.02 493.27 A: i'm sorry about that 

492.72 494.13 B: that's okay [laughter] 

494.78 508.21 B: but you know it's it's they're you know they're they're making like this less of money and then they're they're working really hard i mean if you've really seen the people in restaurants you know you know that they're making not that much because they're working that much harder they put up with rude customers 

508.22 512.81 B: i'm like you know i couldn't do it i couldn't make five fifteen an hour because it's crazy 

512.87 522.93 B: you know i'm i'm i go online i look for jobs i look for everything i'm willing to relocate because it's the cost of living especially in new york and new jersey 

523.06 524.08 B: it's it's 

523.76 527.65 A: maybe down south you could live on five fifteen an hour but you can't up here 

527.36 535.69 B: you can't but you know what the minute that you move down south the cost of living is cheaper but the minimum the wage is lower 

535.85 538.51 A: but it doesn't go below the five fifteen though 

538.04 547.25 B: no not at all it's like it's um it's at least six dollars i think it's like the minimum wage is like six bucks an hour and the cost of living you know it's it's cheaper 

538.91 539.64 A: (( [noise] )) 

547.37 561.42 B: the stuff down there is a lot cheaper you go down there and you get stuff at wholesale that's why so many people are now flocking down south so many new yorkers and people from the tri-state areas are like you know running to go down south because of the fact that 

561.51 569.18 B: it's it's cheaper they know it's cheaper five fifteen an hour especially in new york especially in the metro area is just 

569.24 573.84 B: i mean it's not enough and then even if you try to cut and try to save 

573.92 575.38 B: try taking a bus 

574.83 577.02 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

575.61 582.72 B: try taking a train you take a train twice a d- a day to work back and forth that's your pay check right there 

580.41 580.99 A: (( [noise] )) 

583.03 585.10 B: (( [laughter] you know )) 

585.08 590.61 A: [noise] [noise] that's four dollars a day before taxes taking out that money
