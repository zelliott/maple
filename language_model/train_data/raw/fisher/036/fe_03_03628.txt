0.79 2.42 A: (( um matt )) 

1.69 4.09 B: hi i'm diane how ya doin' 

3.73 8.32 A: i'm doin' fine how 'bout yourself good good 

5.35 6.89 B: not too bad 

7.69 10.47 B: well the topic of the day is minimum wage 

10.06 13.14 A: right [laughter] 

11.19 15.47 B: and five fifteen an hour is certainly minimum wage 

15.39 17.80 A: right certainly uh 

16.79 18.51 B: how do you feel about it 

19.34 20.25 A: oh 

20.31 31.62 A: i- minimum wage in generally uh five i don't know i think all the state minimum wages are higher than five fifteen but [laughter] um th- i think that's just the national one but um 

31.09 32.34 B: where are you 

32.25 35.69 A: oh i'm in california wh- are you from uh jersey 

35.34 38.14 B: no [laughter] i i'm from new york 

36.11 36.99 A: uh-huh 

37.76 42.85 A: new york okay i was just trying to take a guess yeah 

40.30 41.52 B: close 

41.90 48.87 B: um i think our minimum in new york is five seventy five or five fifty 

48.62 54.35 A: yeah i think that's california too but five seventy five i think 

51.55 52.45 B: um 

53.77 60.74 B: but even that i mean can you imagine being like a person who wants to get off welfare 

60.61 62.44 A: (( right )) 

60.81 65.46 B: or has to get off welfare a mo- like a single parent 

65.54 72.54 B: either a mother or a father that has to take a job for minimum wage how can you possibly live on that 

72.36 75.84 A: exactly but yeah 

75.11 77.83 B: i mean i don't know what you do um 

77.03 81.73 A: b- i'm a student right now but yeah 

78.87 86.62 B: you're a student okay so y- you must know how much it co- you know they pay to work in mcdonald's 

85.98 87.85 A: yeah 

86.68 89.03 B: like how much is that these days 

89.15 93.47 A: oh i th- i think it starts at minimum wage i yeah 

93.27 104.72 B: i mean what you know what is the incentive for people to try to better themselves and go to work when all they're making is less than you can live on 

104.88 111.41 A: yeah the thi- the difficult thing about minimum wage also is that you know as soon as uh as so- 

111.34 118.88 A: i mean the fault lies with the company too 'cause as soon as um any government raises minimum wage whether it's state or federal 

118.81 131.16 A: they raise the prices to like compensate for minimum wage so th- so the prices of goods go up at the same time people are making more so minimum wage is never going to be enough because [laughter] or oftentimes because of the [laughter] 

120.22 121.45 B: [laughter] 

130.34 135.28 B: that's true and i know right now in new york that the um 

135.69 144.86 B: the transit just went up additional fifty cents so now it's two do- which it's two dollars a ride 

139.60 140.64 A: oh 

144.94 152.15 B: so you figure you know a person gotta get to and from their place of business and they're making minimum wage 

152.04 161.01 A: and it's at least four dollars to now do do they charge extra for uh for ch- for uh switching trains or 

152.26 153.24 B: so 

153.53 155.69 B: it's at least four dollars 

160.70 161.63 B: well 

161.74 165.42 B: you know i'm not a big transit person because i drive 

163.99 165.08 A: (( oh okay )) 

165.45 170.86 B: but there are of course there are places you can get free free transfers 

170.68 171.99 A: okay 

171.36 177.69 B: but still you know you're working like an hour just to pay to get to and from where you're going 

177.46 178.85 A: (( exactly [laughter] )) 

178.38 181.76 B: because taxes oh you know are what they are 

181.81 187.40 B: and it's really kinda ridiculous although we're you know like if you 

187.53 196.26 B: if you raise minimum wage then everything gotta get go up so it's kinda like you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't 

191.51 193.44 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

196.01 198.40 A: right exactly 

196.52 202.79 B: [laughter] so you know we're and where do they pick these topics anyway i mean [laughter] 

201.34 202.56 A: [laughter] i don't know 

203.03 207.12 A: i don't yeah wh- what i i guess 

207.53 211.08 A: the deeper problem i see behind it is you know we have this uh 

211.28 212.21 A: this 

213.63 218.59 A: o- okay no no one wants blue collar jobs anymore everyone wants white collar jobs and so 

217.54 218.45 B: right 

218.48 229.57 A: blue collar work isn't valued so they're not paid as much so the wh- you have this huge difference between the white collar and uh th- the white collar workers and the blue collar workers where as if you dec- 

229.81 243.09 A: i- if you lessen the difference then the blue col- white collar workers wouldn't make as much but they'd still be living fine and the blue collar workers would be living a lot better and i mean [laughter] and yeah 

240.34 243.78 B: yeah but that's kinda like would anybody do that 

243.38 247.16 A: exactly 'cause no one values blue collar work anymore [laughter] i mean 

246.79 250.34 B: yeah but who's you know like who's gonna serve your hamburger 

248.28 250.02 A: yeah 

250.21 251.35 A: exactly 

250.40 254.99 B: you know or who's gonna um work in the dry cleaning store you know 

254.94 269.01 B: um and mostly you know it's people like immigrants that do it you know or um the less quote lesser um people of the community and kids you know kids 

259.65 261.51 A: mhm 

267.50 269.37 A: yeah 

268.97 275.02 B: i've listen i could understand i don't know how old you are if you're a student if you're are you in college 

274.57 278.43 A: yeah i'm uh i'm graduating this ma'am i'm twenty i'm twenty two 

276.73 277.51 B: oh 

277.94 279.47 B: congratulations 

278.88 280.08 A: oh thank you 

279.62 280.99 B: what's your major 

280.70 281.87 A: english 

281.40 283.49 B: oh really okay 

282.41 284.22 A: yeah 

284.04 296.30 B: i'd bet- i'd better s- talk well then [laughter] i could understand paying a student maybe minimum wage or a little bit better 

286.87 290.86 A: oh no it's okay [laughter] no 

295.87 298.13 A: mhm 

296.43 300.05 B: but i i think it should be like maybe 

300.33 301.34 B: (( uh um )) 

301.68 305.52 B: if you're in your twenties you get paid a little more 

305.92 308.98 B: or in your thirties you get paid a little more 

309.59 315.97 B: because usually people you know students you know of course students need money they always do 

309.86 311.64 A: yeah 

316.22 321.69 B: but people in their twenties and thirties who have to work at minimum wage jobs 

321.81 329.95 B: usually have to support themselves you know they're not they can't go to their parents for money they can't take a student loan 

324.82 326.69 A: (( right )) 

330.06 337.80 B: um i don't know if if that's just dreaming or you know that would ever happen but i i don't know i don't 

338.19 339.63 B: i i know i 

339.73 350.42 B: i would like to find myself 'cause i don't work right now but i'd like to find a part time job but like i wouldn't work for less than fifteen dollars an hour 

350.07 355.39 A: exactly a- and especially in new york city i mean [laughter] isn't it expensive to live there 

352.42 354.08 B: [laughter] 

354.60 360.80 B: well i'm sure it's wh- i don't know what part of california you're in but california is up there too 

360.45 362.70 A: that's true yeah 

361.23 367.68 B: i mean you know you're not in uh like the deep south you know um in appalachia or something 

365.74 374.84 A: yeah [laughter] exactly if i was in appalachia i wouldn't be able to find a job to do anything [laughter] 

368.24 369.76 B: so you know 

372.61 376.26 B: [laughter] that's true they can't find even minimum wage jobs 

376.31 386.06 B: but um ca- i mean i was in i went to california it's a beautiful state i was in san francisco and went up the coast i- i- it's stunning 

386.17 390.10 B: um but it's not cheap there either i mean no- 

389.19 390.89 A: yeah 

390.20 393.86 B: w- really there's nowhere that cheap anymore 

393.69 395.49 A: (( no yeah )) 

394.33 399.40 B: um new york i'm in i'm in brooklyn you ever h- heard of brooklyn new york 

398.90 401.33 A: oh yeah of course yeah 

399.70 405.45 B: okay um [cough] i don't live in the city because i can't afford to 

405.58 406.54 B: um 

406.68 410.02 B: i i couldn't possibly afford the rents 

409.93 411.21 A: yeah 

410.08 411.03 B: um 

411.39 422.63 B: nobody in the city i'm sure that has an apartment is making minimum wage [laughter] because they could a studio goes for eighteen hundred dollars 

418.37 420.14 A: yeah 

421.80 423.31 A: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

423.03 426.09 B: so you know like there's just no way 

426.05 432.73 B: um unless you have a rent controlled apartment that's been handed down for years and you're paying like a hundred dollars a month 

432.19 434.24 A: mhm 

432.67 441.90 B: um and let's face it minimum wage jobs are usually the pits you know it's usually the the dirty work the work that nobody else wants to do 

442.35 444.00 B: so um 

443.12 445.05 A: right 

445.11 446.39 B: i i 

446.80 450.75 B: i don't even remember what the topic said we should talk about 

449.30 450.24 A: (( oh )) 

450.31 453.96 A: what do you think about the rate as a and if it's enough and things like 

453.11 455.62 B: oh well five fifteen 

455.83 460.21 B: when you take taxes out that has to be like four something an hour 

458.14 464.79 A: that yeah probably about four seventy five or around th- yeah i don't know yeah 

463.44 468.42 B: is that depressing or what i mean [laughter] you know like 

465.32 467.61 A: yeah [laughter] 

469.10 476.22 B: h- how you know you can't even have pride in what you do when you're making that kind of money you know what i mean 

476.14 477.98 A: (( r- right )) 

476.90 482.00 B: and i always wondered why when i went to mcdonald's you know like went through the drive through 

482.01 493.06 B: i always got these cruddy sandwiches because you [laughter] you know like they look so good on t._v. you know with the nice lettuce and tomato and you get it home it's like one big moosh 

484.27 486.97 A: [laughter] yeah no joy 

492.84 494.72 A: yeah 

493.03 498.80 B: that's because you got people who don't care about what they're doing because they're not making enough to do anything 

498.79 507.75 A: well yeah i yeah i and i don't know the thing is is that we'll co- i think a lot of companies are so concerned about profits too you know 

507.83 515.67 A: i- like th- they don't just wanna make money they always wanna be making more money n- you know just p- pay your workers well and make your money 

515.21 530.05 B: well look at enron i mean you know [laughter] look at that i mean all the all the bigwigs you know the high management guys got made fortunes and the poor you know th- the people who really keep companies in business 

517.11 518.94 A: (( yeah )) 

525.11 526.97 A: right 

530.10 541.51 B: don't get paid you know and all you hear now is the economy's bad you know we can't pay you i know my girlfriend was working for a company for like seventeen years 

541.15 543.00 A: mhm 

541.72 544.29 B: and she went to go on vacation 

544.31 549.71 B: and the friday that she was leaving on vacation they told her don't come back 

549.37 550.12 A: (( ooh )) 

550.34 558.11 B: so when she went out to look for a new job this you know she has all this experience and th- the 

558.27 561.56 B: companies that she went looking for they didn't wanna pay what sh- 

561.58 562.99 B: she was making 

563.02 569.92 B: because they can get someone you know c- just coming outta college and stuff and pay them much less 

567.53 568.63 A: right 

570.38 580.46 B: and they didn't care about the experience they figure you know we'll train you know we'll train you or whatever so it was really hard and i i could imagine how 

576.21 577.32 A: right 

580.66 587.94 B: bad people must feel that gotta work in these jobs that really have like a family to support 

587.70 589.07 A: exactly 

588.43 594.19 B: and stuff i mean i- you know they must come home at the end of the day and go what the hell am i doing 

593.95 594.90 A: (( [laughter] mm )) 

594.27 597.79 B: i mean even my cleaning girl makes more than that
