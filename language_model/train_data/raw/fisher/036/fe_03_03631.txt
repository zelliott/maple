12.71 13.97 B: mhm 

14.06 17.28 A: and we're our topic is minimum wage 

16.25 19.39 B: minimum wage of five dollars and fifteen cents an hour 

19.14 20.20 A: okay 

19.82 23.53 B: is there anyone left that makes five dollars and fifteen cents an hour 

23.60 33.30 A: i don't know where about where you live but here um in san francisco that buys you about a cup of coffee [laughter] at starbucks that's about all 

31.66 34.37 B: and it's not much more in philadelphia 

33.45 38.18 A: [laughter] [laughter] so i uh 

38.43 46.73 A: i could see both sides if you were a small business owner [sigh] i'm sure um by the time you paid your insurance and your taxes and 

39.84 40.70 B: mhm 

46.99 51.56 A: all that cu- your rent it probably is uh 

49.38 50.18 B: mhm 

51.79 57.96 A: all you'd wanna pay for an employee but if you're trying to make ends meet there's no way you can do that in today 

55.67 70.65 B: well in in philadelphia unfortunately we have a lot of single parent no no you know trying to raise children and they're not gonna do that on five dollars and fifteen cents an hour working in the mcdonald's or burger king or 

65.36 66.41 A: right 

70.14 71.46 A: right 

70.60 72.92 B: all those others and especially when you 

71.91 73.01 A: correct 

72.99 75.21 B: factor in the cost of healthcare 

75.78 77.02 A: exactly 

76.49 78.39 B: yeah and i know in philidal- 

77.22 81.78 A: even if you're even if you're just single or even a teenager 

81.27 82.48 B: mhm 

81.90 88.87 A: i mean uh i don't know where you live but here we are our movie theatre is just ten dollars to get in 

88.41 92.20 B: well i think we're about eight here in philadelphia down the down 

90.58 101.10 A: okay and then if a if a teenager wanted to go and uh put gas in his tank and get a pizza he would have to work a- all day to put [laughter] 

97.50 103.05 B: i'm sure the gas i'm sure the gas in california's a little bit higher than here in philadelphia 

101.13 106.07 A: [laughter] yeah he would have to work all day at five dollars 

103.60 109.44 B: w- w- w- w- we were shocked at a dollar sixty five an hour and i think you guys might've been closer to two dollars now 

108.96 111.52 A: yeah we're two thirty right now 

110.31 111.14 B: oh 

111.15 112.23 B: right now 

111.89 113.41 A: yeah two twenty nine 

113.04 118.97 B: oh well right now in philadelphia we're down to i think it's a dollar forty eight or so 

118.91 121.92 A: yeah that's that's very good 

121.16 122.37 B: mhm 

122.23 126.86 A: but um in order to have the money for uh 

127.23 133.78 A: to just get by you have like seven teenagers not even thinking of a family or having a single parent 

133.15 134.84 B: mhm 

134.29 144.93 A: you need a lot more than five dollars but also where we live we're very fortunate because most jobs even for the students and that start at least at eight dollars 

136.48 137.26 B: right 

144.44 145.36 B: okay 

145.23 152.44 A: so um the the baseline is five up but we are are fortunate enough to um 

152.14 156.91 B: well how 'bout your local politicians do they support a minimum wage increase 

156.81 166.18 A: oh yes definitely well um in the state of california which is primarily democrat so they they always want more because 

157.90 158.75 B: okay 

162.24 163.26 B: mhm 

164.71 172.58 B: well we're we're in philadelphia and we have a democratic mayor and a democratic city council but unfortunately they act like uh republicans for a lot of time [laughter] 

168.75 169.62 A: right 

173.17 175.38 A: well they uh they want 

175.67 179.19 A: they do want wages higher but 

179.76 186.97 A: of course where we live the [sigh] rent and the lease is so high and the property value's so high 

186.50 187.63 B: mhm 

187.00 192.51 A: that if you are a small businessperson it is very hard to uh 

192.75 194.05 A: (( employ a )) 

194.39 202.99 A: lot of employees because of the fact that your overhead is so much that you have to cut back on the other end which is not good but what are you gonna do 

195.46 196.30 B: mhm 

201.67 202.50 B: right 

202.84 204.04 B: mhm 

203.70 206.83 A: so i can see it for both sides you know 

207.14 212.61 A: and uh although it's a shame that the person working has to do without 

212.76 217.65 A: but i guess some way somehow you have to balance the books 

217.45 221.27 B: [lipsmack] well [sigh] i don't know i i i think it's 

221.10 235.31 B: everyone that goes out there and tries to work an honest living and working for forty hours a week or thirty five hours a week or thirty seven and a half hours a week deserves some type of wage and some type of healthcare benefits that will 

234.31 235.11 A: right 

235.56 237.59 B: help them you know 

237.98 245.65 B: help them s- support their family and obviously you're not doing that on five dollars an hour or five dollars and fifteen cents an hour so 

240.42 241.31 A: (( i know )) 

245.17 246.13 A: right 

246.43 250.51 A: it's true and that's probably why so much i- i know 

250.70 255.25 A: we have three teenagers why we stress definitely education right now 

254.14 255.00 B: mhm 

255.19 266.66 A: because uh years ago you could just pump gas or go work at k-mart or walmart or whatever and you could make it on just the basic salary or be a truck driver or whatever but nowadays 

260.70 261.57 B: mhm 

264.06 264.97 B: well 

265.31 272.50 B: it's interesting that you should mention walmart because uh walmart is trying to do an expansion here in our neighborhood here in philadelphia 

272.26 273.01 A: uh-huh 

272.62 277.20 B: and i would say most of our neighborhood is totally opposed to them 

277.04 277.97 A: really 

277.59 281.32 B: yes they are one of the most successful companies 

281.39 283.82 B: businesses in the united states 

283.46 284.41 A: mhm 

283.91 287.24 B: yet they provide no healthcare for their employees 

286.85 287.76 A: right 

287.62 297.22 B: so i- it may be nice to pay your employees seven dollars or earn eight dollars an hour they pay above the minimum but if you don't provide them any type of healthcare 

287.78 289.41 A: they just give you a flat w- 

292.57 293.38 A: uh-huh 

294.26 295.11 A: okay 

296.68 297.51 A: okay 

297.32 299.22 B: yeah it's 

298.33 301.09 A: so that's the reason they don't want them in 

300.99 314.78 B: mm well th- th- i would say i- i- it's you know i- i- in our neighborhood here in philadelphia if if you have someone uh uh with some older areas where they're to renovate you wanna bring some type of new business in 

314.21 315.48 A: of course 

315.01 321.78 B: but you bring this new business in but don't provide any type of decent healthcare 

322.04 335.99 B: for the employees who work there and you are without a doubt the most richest company in the united states and don't provide that for your employees you know frown upon it w- i live in a very union area in the city of philadelphia 

334.75 336.57 A: mhm mhm 

336.59 339.05 B: and while walmart may 

339.07 341.12 B: build their 

341.23 348.19 B: buildings using union labor they do not use union labor for the folks who work inside there 

348.11 349.03 A: okay 

349.09 350.81 A: now how's your unemployment though 

351.05 361.94 B: [lipsmack] in philadelphia i would say we're pretty much now with the rest of the area i mean our our college students are struggling to get jobs because of what's going on in the country 

352.20 353.18 A: yes 

361.48 362.30 A: okay 

362.00 366.45 B: right it's uh it's great that our president would like to do 

366.51 373.69 B: have universal healthcare for the folks of iraq but what about the folks of the united states 

374.74 378.28 A: well i uh i wonder why um [lipsmack] 

378.36 382.70 A: they don't still want walmart though because even though 

383.10 391.37 A: it's not good for older people or or even it it is good they do employ seniors and you would think it would 

389.81 390.76 B: mhm 

391.33 398.06 B: and the seniors are going to work there because the seniors cannot pay their premiums that they have to pay for healthcare now 

391.47 392.59 A: it could c- 

397.47 399.82 A: right right 

398.19 407.44 B: because they're retired and they wanna enjoy the retirement years and now because of this healthcare crisis they can't afford their healthcare so they h- have to go out and get a part time job 

407.35 408.55 A: i i 

407.48 410.78 B: while they should be enjoying their retirement years yeah 

409.82 415.37 A: don't know exactly but the whether the solution though because of the fact that um 

416.25 422.24 A: it'll just end up being we're paying for the healthcare unless these companies pick it up 

422.68 425.26 A: and obviously they're not going to 

425.44 428.39 A: so what do you do in that situation 

428.82 432.69 A: it'll end up coming out of our pockets in the long run the people that are working 

433.08 438.65 A: so here you're taxed more so it comes back that your wages are dropped actually 

437.03 449.82 B: [lipsmack] mhm yeah but i think we're already taxed because those folks who are in our country now who are uninsured or have no health insurance those of us who have health insurance are in fact paying for them 

444.64 445.47 A: right 

449.60 451.16 A: of course i'm right on 

449.90 458.56 B: all all of us all of us who have health insurance our premiums are part of that premium is to go towards the uninsured or under insured 

458.58 464.97 B: and when you take forty one or forty two million americans working americans don't have health insurance 

465.11 466.45 B: there's something wrong 

466.23 469.48 A: right and a- a lot of i know our problem is 

469.65 477.07 A: being as we're close to l._a. and san diego and we're on the border of mexico we have a lot of illegal immigrants here 

476.07 478.17 B: yes mhm oh th- 

477.21 487.00 A: or people with just green cards and we are g- supplying them fully with healthcare while ou- while our own american people have do not have it 

482.43 483.24 B: mhm 

486.19 487.38 B: mhm 

487.05 494.36 A: and i see that every day as well as educating um the students and spending thousands of dollars a year 

494.41 500.57 A: and our own students are are uh not doing well because there's not enough money 

500.16 501.67 B: yep that's right 

501.56 503.46 A: so the whole situation 

501.92 511.62 B: i i i have two i have two children who graduated from college and yeah it's both of them when they graduated and one's twenty five and one's twenty three and it was you know 

505.30 506.26 A: mhm 

510.30 511.26 A: mhm 

511.86 516.10 B: and uh a little bit of a chore the past couple of years for them to get a decent paying job 

515.84 516.99 A: of course 

516.59 517.75 B: (( yeah )) 

518.03 524.29 A: well i don't know but i love walmart sorry [laughter] 

521.17 524.54 B: [laughter] so i guess you like sam's books too 

524.64 535.15 A: [laughter] i don't have we don't have that we just have walmart and that's i have to drive about forty mi- five minutes away to get one we don't have one here so but 

526.19 527.32 B: (( oh okay )) 

531.42 532.29 B: mhm 

533.51 545.11 B: oh i i just have a problem when what they tell you is one of the most the largest employer of united states citizens throughout this country is walmart and when you don't 

539.27 540.07 A: uh-huh 

543.24 544.16 A: okay 

545.23 559.52 B: pay them a high enough wage or provide them with healthcare benefits i have a problem with that i also have a problem where walmart actually coaches coaches their employees how to go to their state 

559.58 566.32 B: to get some type of health benefits because they don't pay them enough high enough wage and in fact that's yes 

563.02 566.18 A: oh okay i di- i wasn't aware of that 

566.32 573.41 A: i do know th- that in nebraska and that's where my family originated from in that um [lipsmack] 

573.68 579.88 A: a lot of the people that are still on farms or [sigh] are still in the small ti- towns 

579.80 594.35 A: see to them they would never fight i mean they need healthcare i agree with that but they would never fight for the higher wages because to them th- it's almost like they're rich when they get their paycheck it's i- when we go back there we laugh because it's not um 

583.40 584.20 B: mhm 

594.70 599.89 A: anywhere near what we could live on but yet their life is so simple and their 

595.54 598.47 B: (( mm right mm )) 

598.76 599.80 B: mhm
