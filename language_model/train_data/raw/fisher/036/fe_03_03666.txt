0.47 2.22 A: hi i'm mark how're you 

1.69 5.91 B: hi i'm rhonda how are you go- i'm good [laughter] thanks 

7.03 11.41 A: [laughter] um so minimum wage how do you feel about that 

10.48 18.42 B: uh not too good i don't think that's nearly enough for most people for well for [laughter] any person to live on 

18.49 20.45 B: it's pretty bad 

20.21 31.16 A: yeah i'm not i i'm so distanced from uh from minimum wage that i don't know enough about it but from everything that i've heard it's way too low um 

29.94 31.06 B: right 

32.47 33.47 A: (( i uh )) 

33.43 38.28 A: i heard some nasty like practices that have changed that i read recently which are 

38.17 51.84 A: kind of annoying [lipsmack] um one of 'em is starbucks [cough] so that the new type of software that people are selling which is called uh like resource management software i don't know if you're familiar with that but um [lipsmack] 

51.89 61.47 A: they use it to like optimize their um use of employees and things like that so like the traditional coffee house um [lipsmack] 

57.57 59.22 B: oh really 

61.39 63.78 A: will have like uh 

63.68 78.17 A: you know an employee that works there all day where starbucks now figured out that you know they only really need extra people in the mornings and the evenings and have people that work these horrible shifts they work from like six to nine a._m. and then five to eight p._m. like clock or split shifts and stuff 

77.78 78.85 B: right 

78.93 80.28 A: (( pretty lame )) 

79.63 83.39 B: yep well do they pay minimum wage or 

83.40 84.66 B: like starbucks 

83.58 87.32 A: um i think they pay probably higher than that but still it's uh 

87.37 101.61 B: oh really yeah no it's just i i think the minimum wage should be like twelve dollars [laughter] an hour or something i know like businesses couldn't support that kind of wage but i mean for people who have a decent living you know 

102.19 112.33 B: that's really what they need you know at least to get you know an apartment a decent apartment or a decent you know place to live and you know proper food 

112.65 117.51 B: it would have to take that much money you know i mean not that [laughter] that's a lot but 

117.52 118.88 B: you know what i mean 

119.00 121.23 A: oh yes totally it's uh 

120.97 130.79 B: i mean but then again you got your teenagers who are living at home and they don't need you know a huge amount of money 'cause the parents are supporting them 

131.33 144.83 A: yeah i heard there's uh some recent statistics that are looked at like people working at mcdonald's and it used to be mainly like teenagers and people with no experience and now there's lots of older people that are taking those jobs 

131.63 132.67 B: so that co- 

144.42 147.26 B: yeah like seniors like i 

146.48 147.87 A: horrible ages 

147.47 150.94 B: yeah i've seen like you know you go into um 

150.95 159.27 B: i'm trying to think where i've seen seniors working like like donut places and stuff like that and you kinda wonder like you know 

159.28 161.90 B: i always think that maybe you know 

162.47 169.10 B: retirement isn't giving them enough money that they need to you know start working you know part time job 

169.51 178.23 B: but it's sad for them because they've worked all their lives and then they have to get minimum wage but maybe it just gets them out of the house they don't care you know 

178.55 181.97 B: there's always that to it too you know something to do 

182.48 184.30 A: what's that 

184.14 190.98 B: oh like senior citizens you know how they how you see them working like in minimum wage type jobs 

191.71 193.06 A: yeah 

191.85 202.17 B: they you know like you wonder if the pension isn't like holding out [laughter] you know they're not getting enough money or whatever or or whether they just wanna like work 

202.36 204.51 B: and they don't really care about the money 

202.48 211.39 A: yeah i think some of it's probably partially not having enough retirement savings and second you know i think some people just get bored you know 

211.05 212.53 B: yeah 

212.22 217.14 A: but i mean some of the jobs they're doing don't look like things you'd [laughter] wanna do for fun so 

215.70 216.38 B: (( mm )) 

217.01 219.24 B: no really yeah 

218.95 231.78 A: or they're yeah i wonder so what do you think the effects would be if you raised the minimum wage to twelve dollars i mean how would that affect the economy how would that affect like you and i on a daily basis what would that do like what would be the side effects 

223.95 224.80 B: [laughter] 

231.83 241.72 B: well i think that maybe um see see the thing is teenagers come into that too 'cause they get affected by the minimum wage and uh so 

242.49 247.60 B: they don't have the skills to or the experience you know 

247.97 248.83 B: to 

249.09 251.79 B: um wh- what's the word i'm looking for to 

252.50 260.79 B: to justify that that wage you know so it's across the boards you know because i mean there's laws you know you can't discriminate against 

260.84 263.43 B: age and stuff like that so 

263.50 264.75 B: who knows 

263.58 264.27 A: (( um )) 

264.89 269.49 B: but uh so have you done this this before this uh 

270.18 272.46 A: i've done this is my third time i guess 

272.04 274.69 B: your third time yeah this is my second time 

274.87 283.22 B: actually the person i spoke to last night i don't wanna get off topic too much but it it's about the way we speak it's not about the topic right 

283.19 288.92 A: [noise] ri- ri- right exactly it's about the way people interact a fr- friend of mine that's in a um 

285.43 286.44 B: yeah they jus- 

289.10 300.79 A: [lipsmack] program that's working on her phd doing something with linguistics that actually told me about this so i figured if she was like oh yeah we need more data for the database it's great so [laughter] 

299.46 313.65 B: yeah so it's not exa- 'cause somebody told me last night they said well you know i think if we get off topic you know like wh- you uh we're not gonna get paid and i said well you know i said i don't think it has [laughter] anything to do with topic they just want you to keep talking [laughter] you know 

313.52 314.71 B: so that they can 

313.77 325.04 A: when i was on my first conversation i was talking with somebody about censorship in schools and [laughter] we talked for about two minutes and realized we were in complete agreement so we ran out of [laughter] stuff to talk about 

324.39 333.98 B: oh really yeah 'cause i think it's just the voices that they're interested in that's why you know you get asked like where you're born and where you're from so where where are you 

334.12 336.13 A: um i'm in seattle how 'bout you 

336.58 341.32 B: uh the guy last night was from seattle [laughter] too i'm in toronto 

340.05 340.84 A: [laughter] 

341.42 342.58 B: canada 

341.61 342.63 A: (( oh )) 

342.89 350.36 B: so that's that that's kind of it's kind of strange like you know i 'cause you sound like you could be from here you know 

350.62 351.42 B: like you're 

350.70 357.79 A: yeah i've lived all over the place though i grew up in phoenix i've lived in germany i've lived in switzerland i've lived in new zealand so 

358.01 360.56 A: i've kind of got a 

360.67 362.79 A: lived in a bunch of different places 

362.22 367.38 B: yeah well i work for a swiss company so that's kinda interesting but 

367.62 369.39 A: huh do you get to go out there much 

369.16 381.96 B: uh no no [laughter] i've never been out there no i'd like to go not not see it do anything but the [laughter] with the company but you know just to go out there yeah yeah that'd be interesting 

378.28 380.19 A: do a vacation right 

382.04 384.28 A: yeah that'd be really cool 

383.79 384.96 B: yeah 

384.98 386.92 A: so what do you do for them 

386.45 391.44 B: uh i'm a sensory um specialist i 

391.48 396.08 B: smell things and taste things and i um 

396.19 398.87 B: evaluate things food 

399.10 401.53 A: oh for like products like 

400.74 402.60 B: yeah 

401.85 404.80 A: for recipes and things like that 

403.85 417.47 B: yeah for well basically for the foods that this company manufactures and you know i tell them how sweet something is or how because the human palate is much more sophisticated than 

417.51 421.97 B: a computer or any kind of testing they can do on foods so 

422.00 424.83 B: it's pretty interesting it it's a lot of fun 

425.10 433.54 A: so they they basically do this to figure out um like how to change recipes to make things taste better or 

432.85 436.35 B: yeah to to let them know like what 

436.79 442.63 B: levels things are at like as far as salt sweet acidity um 

442.68 450.95 B: oh there's a whole bunch of things you know i mean it just depends on the food how many layers of tastes are in a food you know 

451.40 452.50 B: so it it's 

452.83 466.73 B: it's a really unusual field people ask me about it all the time [laughter] and i say well i don't think there's a lot of places like you can uh you know train for this or study it i although i think you know where you live the university 

466.78 470.51 B: of washington actually has a has a course 

471.15 475.36 B: on that yeah yeah so i think that's abo- 

471.29 472.85 A: oh really wow 

474.51 476.09 A: that's interesting 

475.45 480.34 B: it's about the only place where you can actually go to school for it but it's 

479.64 481.52 A: how long have you been doing that for 

481.30 490.91 B: uh not long i just sort of changed fields i wanted to get into something more interesting and kind of more fun [laughter] so to speak you know 

490.96 492.53 B: uh just about a year 

492.64 494.62 A: huh it sounds cool 

494.00 495.43 B: yeah so 

494.99 497.64 A: well you'd get exposed to a lot of interesting stuff 

497.48 506.57 B: yeah and it's not like a sit down desk job and you know where you're just sitting there typing away or whatever you know 

506.87 509.75 B: dealing with the day to day grind you know you're 

509.78 512.89 B: doing something that actually you know interests 

513.33 516.36 B: well interests me personally so 

516.75 517.64 B: but 

517.89 519.46 A: uh that's great 

518.75 520.28 B: yeah it is 

520.50 526.97 B: i like it it's uh something really unusual it's a real conversation [laughter] starter 

527.28 527.99 B: (( so )) 

527.46 533.04 A: [laughter] having a job that you uh enjoy makes such a big difference you know 

533.26 541.41 B: yeah getting back you know the we're supposed to be [laughter] on topic getting back to the minimum wage thing like that's the thing th- those people don't 

541.43 545.18 B: enjoy their jobs i don't think i don't think there's much gratification 

545.27 548.98 A: yeah although there's a lot less pressure too i mean i have to say like 

545.63 546.30 B: in 

549.04 562.29 A: you know i worked in uh high tech industry for a long time and you know th- the pressure is tremendous i mean i was working at least sixty hours a week and you know there were periods where 

562.14 570.75 A: there was one period for like two and a half three months i was working a minimum of twelve hour days seven days a week you know and uh 

570.65 578.25 A: you don't get paid any extra for it you know you get whatever your salary is and you just have to get done what you have to get done regardless of you know 

578.50 581.81 A: um what happens so in s- but 

580.72 581.96 B: right 

581.93 593.06 A: definitely working a job that you like is important but you know having set hours and being able to you know say hey it's five o'clock i'm leaving is is uh is quite a 

593.18 594.75 A: quite a bonus 

594.86 599.89 B: yeah well that's the thing thing with my job is that uh the human
