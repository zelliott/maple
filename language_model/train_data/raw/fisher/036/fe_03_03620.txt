237.37 248.92 A: now i have lived you know outside of the city limits my whole life and i've been to the city a lot and nobody ever that was the first time in my life that somebody actually was like pushing tourism 

248.87 251.23 B: wow well that's great great right huh 

250.07 252.33 A: [laughter] yeah yeah 

251.26 256.25 B: so how is the minimum wage decided upon is it ah like the they ah [noise] 

254.98 257.20 A: well i'll tell you the truth i 

257.93 268.85 A: not many places actually pay minimum wage most places um let's say like if you get a job like in mcdonalds which is like like one of the lowest paying jobs around 

265.43 266.44 B: mhm 

268.11 269.68 B: yeah same here yeah 

269.07 270.72 A: seven dollars an hour here 

270.52 271.74 B: yeah 

271.09 272.44 A: they would get seven 

272.77 274.64 A: that would be the going rate 

272.81 273.66 B: wow 

274.26 277.73 B: yeah i guess otherwise you're not going to get anybody to work for you you know so 

276.99 281.67 A: no i i really can't think of anybody who would work for five fifteen an hour 

281.40 282.64 B: mhm 

281.95 294.78 A: i mean i i i i don't even know what the minimum wage was until the person you know before the survey started asked the question you know said the question that the minimum wage is going up first to five fifteen 

291.20 292.12 B: right 

294.54 295.37 B: wow 

294.71 297.72 A: i had no idea that it was even that low 

297.26 307.83 B: yeah see five fifteen u._s. would be approximately seven fifty canadian dollars seven seven dollars and fifty cents and i believe our minimum wage is eight something 

303.30 304.19 A: yeah 

307.61 308.49 A: right 

307.90 311.17 B: here so it it'd be comparable anyway and and ah 

311.65 321.23 B: oh yeah i i don't know of anybody other than students you know students would make a minimum wage because they have no experience and a lot of them still live at home or on campus 

320.44 322.49 A: you know even like you know 

322.50 324.39 A: i had um 

325.92 328.32 A: my daughter has was looking for a job 

328.34 339.16 A: and she had gone into a place and right away they were going to say oh we'll give you like six fifty an hour because if you're 'cause you know they thought she was younger than what she was 

338.56 339.45 B: right 

339.21 350.55 A: and that's with like the kids sixteen seventeen summer jobs they're getting it's like six fifty but even them they're not getting that little because it's just too little 

343.98 345.18 B: (( right mhm )) 

350.31 351.46 B: yeah 

350.78 352.70 A: it's like why bother 

352.44 353.82 B: right exactly 

353.32 357.62 A: i mean and you after taxes there's there's nothing left 

357.07 365.75 B: mhm and now a lot of people can do work on the computer you know at home and they can make a lot more money doing something like that where they don't 

363.62 367.16 A: i know like doing like doing surveys for fisher 

366.77 369.42 B: exactly this is my second one how about you

387.23 388.05 B: (( mm yeah )) 

387.57 400.75 A: because it was quite a while ago but just last week i got two checks for them from them for twenty dollars and they came separately so you know that's you know and there's a way of doing more 

391.79 393.16 B: oh that's great

465.47 467.22 A: it was so boring 

467.97 481.09 B: kind of know like i almost didn't accept this call 'cause i thought what do i know about minimum wage and i and i know that ah the fisher program originates from the u._s._a. and i thought okay well i know even less about their [laughter] minimum wage but then i thought well like

541.20 546.02 B: yeah [laughter] you know you you think that but then you also think you know i know people in toronto and 

545.79 558.30 B: and people in toronto are definitely walking around without masks they don't care they're getting on the subway you know it's just so few cases you know it's like you're you're you're you're more 

555.55 560.86 A: i know but they're it's going to hurt it's going to hurt your tourism there this summer 

559.62 569.47 B: it definitely definitely it's too bad because i mean you're you're more likely to get like chickenpox or something you know it's just it's so slim of a chance of getting it but
