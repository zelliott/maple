50.21 52.65 B: yeah they're ah they're having fun 

52.84 54.09 B: they're having fun 

54.39 57.20 B: so we're supposed to talk about um 

56.52 58.64 A: minimum wage [laughter] 

57.64 60.20 B: of being what five fifteen 

60.21 61.59 A: is that all it is 

62.02 63.86 B: do you know what i 

63.10 65.86 A: it was like five fifteen two years ago [noise] 

65.24 66.34 B: i don't 

66.41 68.24 B: believe it's enough 

68.86 70.09 B: and 

70.73 75.12 B: ah here in it- it's different here it's ah 

75.33 82.59 B: i get offered jobs as an administrative assistant for eight dollars an hour and they think that's good 

83.28 89.87 A: see eight dollars an hour wouldn't get you a i i mean you know in new york our pizza delivery guys get more than eight dollars an hour 

86.65 87.95 B: wouldn't do anything 

89.48 99.04 B: i know i made ah um more than half of that so i i i more than doubled my money when i was living in new york than eight dollars so 

99.09 101.00 B: five fifteen an hour 

101.88 104.79 B: there's too many people not making enough money now 

104.26 106.41 A: no it's insane [laughter] 

104.84 110.25 B: and if they allowed to only pay five fifteen an hour they're going to do what they can to pay 'em that 

109.22 110.12 A: yeah 

110.16 122.82 A: well not only that but if you make five fifteen an hour and you figure that's not enough to feed the normal person all you're doing is wasting somebody's time who's going to have to turn around and get government assistance anyway 'cause they're not making enough money to survive 

121.79 124.49 B: i know i think it's okay for 

125.21 131.80 B: i used to work at the wrestler when i lived in new york um you know when you're when you're in high school five fifteen an hour 

125.32 126.20 A: kids 

132.07 139.34 B: i guess in certain circumstances it it isn't bad but it it also the fact is it qualifies for adults also 

134.12 135.36 A: yeah sure 

139.76 141.60 B: it's not just for kids 

139.98 141.11 A: yeah and that's 

141.30 151.26 A: and that's where i mean five fifteen an hour no matter where you live is not going to get you anywhere i mean if we expect people to stay off welfare and and work for a living and we pay them five fifteen an hour i 

151.41 153.85 A: mean that's you can't live off that 

153.17 162.05 B: no no no no you can't um what is it is it n- i think it's what four seventy five four eighty five now 

153.86 154.90 A: (( it's insane )) 

161.75 172.69 A: i didn't realise it was that low i thought it was much higher than that i guess it's just been a long time since i mean i got lucky when i was a kid i was a lifeguard so we got more than minimum [laughter] wage but i didn't realise it was that low 

172.17 173.48 B: yeah 

173.38 174.67 A: that's crazy 

173.81 179.28 B: yeah yeah it is and and for waitresses it's actually different it's 

178.67 181.64 A: oh yeah they get like two and change 'cause of tips 

180.09 186.36 B: it's still the same but you know it's funny because people won't tip thinking that they're getting paid 

186.80 191.73 B: but as waitresses you're only getting paid whatever minimum wage for waitresses are 

191.80 195.55 B: so they rely on their tips because the minimum wage isn't enough 

195.59 204.08 A: yeah that's why i know my sister was a waitress for a long time and i was always she was always complaining about people who stiffed you know who stiffed the tip because technically you get taxed 

204.35 211.54 A: the government assumes that you're making a certain percentage of tips and you actually get taxed on tips so if somebody stiffs you a tip you actually lose money 

211.25 214.87 B: right right it's i think um when i waitressed it was 

215.04 222.66 B: i think eight eight or ten percent of what the sales were of what you turned in in sales 

215.55 218.31 A: percent yeah it was around eight or nine percent 

222.86 223.94 A: (( yeah see )) 

223.80 225.33 B: so um 

224.80 230.15 A: a waitress would have to spit in my food in order for me to stiff the tip you know what i mean come on now 

227.80 228.81 B: [laughter] 

228.82 232.30 B: i know i know i know it's true 

231.80 238.38 A: but i i don't know anybody who can i mean except for a fifteen or sixteen year old kid i don't know anybody who's willing to 

238.71 246.81 A: [noise] work an eight hour or ten hour day and make and walk away with forty dollars and that's before taxes you know i mean that's 

243.62 244.57 B: (( i know )) 

245.62 246.57 B: you know 

247.40 251.95 B: down here if you do extra work in the movies you get paid six dollars an hour 

252.30 255.53 B: so you get paid more than the minimum but 

255.86 260.38 B: and that's not i i turned down extra work well because i 

260.39 263.20 B: i ah do more than that now but 

263.28 268.31 B: a few years ago i was like i can't can't afford to take six dollars an hour 

268.12 268.97 A: no 

268.50 272.89 B: for ten eleven hours a day and it's not overti- you don't get overtime or anything 

273.68 281.05 B: it ended up being forty eight dollars a day and i was like this is crazy it's it's i d- i can't believe where people work like that and 

281.56 284.40 A: yeah i don't i don't know how they survive i mean 

282.30 283.00 B: i 

283.53 284.20 B: i 

285.81 288.84 B: i think people who they don't have a choice 

288.88 293.72 B: maybe they're not american citizens and they have to take what they can get 

293.50 295.69 A: unskilled labor i 

294.51 298.10 B: i i still don't think fi- five fifteen is not enough 

298.36 299.63 B: um 

299.86 308.71 A: mean think about it ah i mean they would have to do the math and figure out what the poverty level was you know like what constitutes somebody to be below the poverty level 

308.83 316.86 A: and work out like you know a forty or fifty hour work week i mean there's just no way five dollars an hour would keep you above poverty level 

312.87 313.83 B: i know 

316.74 318.10 B: they um [lipsmack] 

318.69 323.47 B: with my eight dollars an hour at forty hours a week because we don't get paid for lunch here 

324.40 332.51 B: um i figured that after taxes i'm like you know i- i- i- ah forty times eight is what three [mn] three hundred and sixty i think it was 

332.20 333.04 A: yeah 

332.77 336.97 B: um after tax under under three hundred dollars 

337.10 344.14 B: so i'm doing sales i i resorted to doing life insurance and health insurance and stuff 

343.09 346.05 A: you've got to do i mean you've got to do something you know it's 

344.95 345.73 B: i 

345.74 351.98 B: yeah so i'm commission only so there's some weeks when i don't make any money but i was like my time is money 

352.74 357.40 B: and and eight dollars an hour just isn't worth it for me to sit in an office 

356.09 357.01 A: (( no )) 

357.54 364.74 B: let alone five fifteen an hour i would rather not work than to spend forty hours a week making five dollars 

361.69 363.43 A: and find something else 

364.53 370.61 A: exactly and all you're doing is driving people to do illegitimate work you know or of the books work you know and things like that 

369.79 370.61 B: right 

370.66 371.61 B: right and 

370.78 373.67 A: so at least they can overcome the tax problem 

373.41 381.08 B: and and people who are on unemployment aren't going to quit a job are- aren't going to go off of unemployment for that because they're going to lose their unemployment 

378.89 379.70 A: no 

381.74 384.83 B: while they're still making less than what their unemployment is 

386.10 391.35 A: yeah i mean all you're doing is promoting exactly you're promoting people not to want to get off welfare 

390.96 392.08 B: yeah 

391.42 397.30 A: and not to want to you know seek jobs because it's such i mean we'd be better off 

397.65 402.59 A: i'd rather see the same money that we pay for like welfare to go towards higher 

402.61 411.01 A: you know higher payment of minimum wage because people feel better when they're earning they tend to be more functional citizens when they're actually working in a job 

406.85 407.74 B: yeah 

411.13 416.25 A: and making money versus not working and making the same amount of money from welfare 

415.88 416.83 B: right 

416.42 424.18 A: you know so some of the money towards you know towards the business owners that are paying the the minimum wage or subsidize the minimum wage 

424.65 430.67 A: you know let the business owner pay five fifteen and the government kick in an extra dollar an hour or whatever the case may be 

430.20 437.38 B: yeah yeah i i just it it i it it's kind of degrading to get offered the ah minimum wage 

431.26 432.51 A: (( you know i mean it's )) 

438.04 441.67 A: oh yeah five fifteen an hour i mean good lord i 

438.65 439.66 B: you know 

440.94 442.94 B: that's [laughter] 

443.55 455.54 A: mean i'm in the military so i might as well work for minimum wage for all intent and purposes in terms of our hours but we get a lot of benefits so i mean our our pay works out a lot higher than it 

446.65 448.04 B: oh 

455.51 463.01 A: [noise] may seem on paper because we don't you know we don't pay health care a lot of our food and housing is subsidized so 

459.52 460.49 B: right 

462.89 468.73 B: see it's fun- that's right you know people don't realize that i know with the health insurance 

468.82 471.01 B: when i talk to people 

471.35 475.28 B: they don't realize how much money they're actually making 

475.50 478.71 B: because they're not paying for their medical insurance 

478.17 479.70 A: exactly 

479.07 485.99 B: you know and then suddenly if they lose their medical insurance they're looking for another job with the same money 

486.22 489.87 B: but it ends up being less if they're not offered the same benefits 

489.65 492.72 A: 'cause they've got to turn around and pay all those things they didn't pay before 

491.00 491.84 B: then they 

492.36 497.06 B: exactly [noise] exactly it's so rough out there right now 

493.46 494.43 A: oh yeah 

498.09 500.90 A: (( [noise] well i'm only glad that i'm in a field that's not )) 

500.96 515.58 A: technology related i mean the people who really took a hit were all those all the people who worked for the computer companies and the dot com companies and all these comp- you know computer companies that have scaled back now i mean i know so many friends who 

515.87 521.62 A: you know were working you know high tech computer fields making a lot of money and now they're all out of jobs it's 

521.00 527.25 B: yeah [noise] yeah yeah it really is ah i i think the best thing it seems 

522.23 523.26 A: amazing 

527.74 531.88 B: right now is to work for yourself because y- you 

532.90 535.43 B: you're not relying on someone else 

535.60 537.40 B: you're relying on yourself 

535.94 537.08 A: (( yeah ex- yeah you've )) 

538.21 548.38 A: got to sell something that's the only way [laughter] people are still buying as much as we might be in a [noise] recession people are still buying things so if you can find something [noise] to sell [laughter] you know 

545.38 546.26 B: i know 

548.39 550.70 A: y- you're all right 

549.68 552.94 B: i know i'm ah also selling ah kirby's 

553.71 555.34 B: which are um 

555.64 559.56 B: an upper it's a it's it's a mercedes 

560.68 562.64 B: in in vacuum form 

562.85 564.03 A: (( oh okay )) 

563.65 569.31 B: it's an amazing thing i sold one today for fourteen hundred which was actually a lot less than what they go for 

569.26 570.18 A: wow 

569.59 578.58 B: so people are yeah well that came out of my commission when you sell it for that much less than what they should go for i made that much less 

575.23 576.34 A: (( for less it )) 

579.15 582.28 B: but you know i have a product 

582.56 597.38 B: people love it and they will find a way to pay for it [noise] [lipsmack] so that was an easy two hundred dollars today where people make five fifteen an hour have to work forty hours a week to make that two hundred bucks when i i made it in 

594.07 595.66 A: (( takes forty yeah )) 

597.43 599.89 B: well it took me a little longer i made it in three hour
