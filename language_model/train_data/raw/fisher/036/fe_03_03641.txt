35.60 37.95 A: no not at no five fifteen 

37.46 39.04 B: no it's not 

38.57 47.36 A: and then i don't think that it's right for them to you make bad enough make a minimum wage and then get taxes taken out that's not [noise] hm 

45.63 51.43 B: no doubt no doubt i'm telling you who are those taxes going to if they're taking them from the five fifteen people 

51.36 51.92 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

52.17 55.59 A: (( yeah that's the only thing it's like you might as well not even tax that )) 

55.02 56.19 B: [laughter] 

55.78 66.25 A: i mean to me they should make minimum wage something where you could at least live off of five fifteen that's just maybe enough for you to get to work and maybe eat 

65.85 75.26 B: i'd just rather see 'em do a flat tax on every on just either wages or on all products and then get rid of both 'cause you get taxed two ways no matter how it is 

74.97 76.35 A: uh yeah 

75.75 82.89 B: you know you get taxed on your income and then you turn around and the only break you get is they don't tax you on groceries well big deal 

81.52 82.67 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

83.13 89.26 B: i know i know here in kentucky we pay you probably do too we pay a property tax every year 

89.42 92.19 B: on things that you own do they do that in philadelphia 

91.77 94.55 A: uh n- what you mean on things like 

94.00 95.22 B: like your car 

95.14 97.53 A: you have to pay a property tax on your car 

96.97 98.06 B: yes sir 

98.32 99.44 B: every year 

99.46 101.36 A: no i never heard of that 

100.52 104.78 B: well see we pay we pay a sales tax of six percent when we buy it 

104.20 105.37 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

104.88 107.62 B: and then we turn around and we pay i think it's 

108.42 111.03 B: [sigh] i think it's a tenth of a percent every year 

111.95 116.88 B: i've got a jeep liberty and it's two twenty five every year property tax just on the car have 

117.03 118.99 B: you ever heard of such nonsense 

118.82 120.01 A: no 

119.43 124.83 B: and that's people they don't care if you make minimum wage or if you make a hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year 

124.47 125.51 A: uh-huh 

125.47 127.64 B: so i don't know how those people are making it 

125.60 138.14 A: two twenty five i w- yeah all i'm saying th- if you make a minimum wage how could you afford something like that and you need a car to get to work and how do they figure out where tax suppose you just buy a car off a the street or something 

138.24 140.75 B: no well then you won't have it licensed 

141.93 143.30 B: you know if it it we- 

141.97 145.53 A: [sigh] and then y'all have y'all have to have insurance too 

145.03 145.96 B: right 

146.39 148.03 A: that's that's crazy 

146.77 153.61 B: we have to carry a li- you know at least liability insurance and then they have to carry um 

148.99 149.88 A: mhm 

153.76 163.11 B: you know when you go into the courthouse to have it registered each year which is you know it just depends on where you where you live what state it's anywhere from fifteen to thirty dollars 

162.49 164.38 A: yeah 

163.44 168.69 B: but that's when they hit you for the taxes so you pay the sales tax on it the first year 

169.00 173.82 B: and then you pretty well pay the sales tax again over the next five or six years that you own it 

174.06 175.29 A: [sigh] 

174.93 183.28 B: and then of course you know we pay property taxes like everybody does i think just about every state does that but we do that in addition to it we pay it on our boats too 

177.89 178.94 A: yeah 

179.67 180.79 A: yeah 

183.75 186.27 A: sheesh th- that's a lot 

184.47 187.66 B: [laughter] i'm telling you 

186.35 189.41 A: i thought down south it'd be cheaper than than the 

188.35 195.97 B: well it's supposed to be that's what everybody says you know we have the six percent sales tax which is a lot cheaper than most places 

195.49 196.75 A: yeah 

196.11 199.65 B: but then they tax you on everything else and i don't know how people make it 

199.53 200.77 A: mhm 

200.31 206.21 B: i work at a plant where most of the men are making seventeen to twenty dollars an hour and i see some of them not making it 

206.04 216.14 A: [laughter] yeah that's what i that's what i'm looking at like how are you supposed to on five fifteen and i can't imagine making it off of [mn] anything less than 

210.61 211.61 B: i don't 

216.70 227.79 A: [sigh] i mean i don't even know like six seven ten dollars an hour i think is about the minimum that you can maybe make it off of with all the stuff you have to pay and here in philly 

225.85 228.79 B: (( i know and i tell you wh- go ahead )) 

228.15 231.96 A: we have a a wage tax they've been trying to fight it to get it 

231.79 243.77 A: taken down but a lot of businesses have left because of that wage tax like they take like close to a hundred dollars outta my check just off a the wage tax that's not counting that's just for 

242.89 246.36 B: now do you get that back are you able to file that with your state 

246.41 247.88 A: uh no 

246.71 247.63 B: (( see at the end )) 

247.64 254.90 B: see we have something like that too it's called k. r. e. d. a. kentucky rural economic development council something or another 

249.97 250.98 A: uh-huh 

254.43 255.30 A: (( mm )) 

254.86 267.82 B: and uh what happens is when these differing manufacturing places i guess anybody can get it but a manufacturing firms who usually gets it they'll go in and they get a tax break because they're hiring more workers and they're increasing the tax base 

267.51 268.77 A: oh okay 

267.94 272.74 B: and so what happens is a certain percentage of your income gets paid in 

272.92 276.80 B: you're basically the employees pay the tax for the company 

277.03 288.57 B: for getting the work but like the first five years the employee themselves gets to claim it as a state tax and then after that you don't get to claim it any more it's really weird it's really weird 

288.21 289.63 A: yeah 

289.07 290.17 B: but there's n- 

290.24 301.77 B: i'm i think it all comes down to our healthcare problem in this country if we had better healthcare if we had more like canadian healthcare i think we'd have less problems with people living in poverty 

301.65 304.45 A: yeah you would and then if you had 

304.61 309.44 A: it would then that's another thing 'cause most minimum wage jobs don't even have healthcare so 

308.60 310.01 B: no no 

309.59 315.73 A: those people get stuck in a rut where they can't get out and if they ever get sick they gotta keep going to work 

315.82 327.29 A: because they can't afford to miss any days because they make so little that what they make is just barely enough to to get them maybe to and from work and and to eat 

319.85 320.69 B: right 

326.76 332.09 B: and then there's there's women especially that may have two children no husband no father figure 

331.79 332.69 A: mhm 

332.05 343.22 B: you know so they're their single wage earner and they're trying to support children of course they don't dare go get a job for any more than than minimum wage because then they they don't have any healthcare for their children 

343.24 344.26 A: yeah 

343.28 351.46 B: you know according to the state or you know whichever state you're in if you're making seven eight dollars an hour oh gosh you can provide everything for our family 

351.00 352.36 A: yeah they don't g- 

351.47 353.26 B: you don't need any help 

352.89 355.75 A: (( yeah you don't need any help and )) 

354.85 356.01 B: and that's wrong 

355.77 364.08 A: yeah th- th- that's wrong too you know 'cause they i don't know where th- they get their figures from that you can provide so much off a 

364.08 372.50 A: seven or eight dollars when you know stuff costs so much just just i mean even the cheapest stuff is still 

372.77 374.92 A: is still costing you something 

374.35 375.98 B: oh yeah a- 

375.08 383.84 A: you know if you don't have a car like here we have one of the highest transportation you know costs in the country it's like two dollars to ride the bus 

383.89 385.30 A: that's one way 

384.50 385.55 B: ride the bus 

385.35 387.08 A: yeah ride the bus 

386.94 388.53 B: my gosh 

387.91 391.81 A: yeah ours is ours i think maybe like number two or three 

391.74 392.71 B: good 

391.92 397.08 A: so either two dollars to ride the bus and you're only making five fifteen a hour 

397.76 400.62 B: yeah so so the first hour that y- yeah 

398.30 404.63 A: so you figure it almost takes you a hours pay just to pay for what you had to pay maybe to get to work 

404.51 407.64 B: well not to mention if you're having to pay for childcare in the end term 

407.69 408.99 B: while you're on the bus 

407.87 416.15 A: uh yeah that the cost if you do have a car i mean up here gasoline is starting to go down but it was up to like one 

416.23 419.49 A: one seventy a couple of weeks back 

417.37 418.37 B: yeah 

419.35 421.12 B: that's that's ridiculous 

420.75 423.66 A: uh yeah so like 

424.00 429.00 A: five fifteen is is is is nothing 

428.41 429.96 B: no no 

429.01 433.41 A: and then they wonder why people do you know illegal stuff to 

432.49 434.63 B: no doubt no doubt 

434.39 441.07 A: you know so then they say well i you know you can get a job and i mean but it's hard you got people out here 

434.95 435.75 B: (( hey )) 

441.41 446.09 A: college people that're graduating from college taking entry level jobs 

445.88 446.80 B: right 

446.69 459.88 A: and so what is left for the person that maybe didn't get a chance to go to college that's all that's what they used to get was entry level jobs where you know they would make about ten dollars an hour that was enough but now you got college students getting those jobs so now 

459.66 463.01 A: only thing left for anybody else is minimum wage 

462.40 463.32 B: yeah 

463.38 467.10 B: well and we've just we've turned into such a bureaucratic 

463.52 464.37 A: and 

467.34 476.08 B: society you know when you look at the when you look at the pyramid it's upside down you know the federal workers and state workers make up the majority 

476.26 477.77 B: of your workforce 

477.37 478.37 A: mhm 

477.78 488.56 B: and then it pyramids down 'til you get to the very bottom with skilled laborers and and you know manufacturing personnel and you know your electricians and your different things like that are 

488.24 489.29 A: mhm 

488.94 492.99 B: and that's screwed up now that's just plain old screwed up [laughter] 

492.73 493.94 A: yeah 

493.39 503.59 B: i mean ti- you know nineteen fifty nineteen sixty it wasn't that way you had small government and lots of people you know just normal everyday people don't have that now 

497.14 498.22 A: mhm 

501.84 502.91 A: yeah 

504.23 510.13 B: and the thing is if these people making five fifteen an hour could make enough 

510.51 515.75 B: that you know if you didn't have all these companies having to pay in these gigantic taxes 

516.03 518.95 B: they could pay their workers more money 

518.11 520.09 A: more money yeah 

519.43 532.58 B: well i know for a fact the company i'm with we figure for every ten dollars that we spend per employee per hour we spend an additional four to six dollars on top a that 

532.70 534.42 B: in benefits 

534.52 547.39 B: taxes you know just maintaining stuff so if you figure a guy's making twenty dollars an hour we're spending anywhere from eight to twelve additional hour- dollars per hour 

538.25 539.28 A: uh-huh 

547.90 554.92 B: just maintaining the the paper work the taxes the you know the unemployment tax the social security 

550.53 551.57 A: mhm 

554.54 555.55 A: mhm 

555.08 559.31 B: i mean it's a huge amount and just think if you weren't paying that twelve dollars an hour 

559.34 562.94 B: you could split the difference between you and that fellow that's working 

563.39 566.07 B: there's your minimum wage problem right there 

565.16 567.51 A: right there yeah 

566.58 572.08 B: i i truly believe that i believe it's it we've got too much government and not enough solutions 

571.96 575.20 A: yeah that's what it is and then it's the you know 

572.69 573.50 B: [laughter] 

575.52 584.86 A: th- the big business where the people that are had the most money they're paying the politicians to keep the minimum wage down 

584.57 585.52 B: right 

585.08 599.89 A: they they're like w- w- we'll they'll gladly pay some politician you know send him on a trip or this and that and to say look keep the minimum wage below six dollars or below this because if you do you know and it's not like they're gonna lose 

591.85 592.81 B: right
