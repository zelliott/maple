1.75 3.89 B: (( hi i'm scottie )) 

3.58 4.72 A: (( how're you doing )) 

4.36 5.92 B: good how are you 

5.41 6.67 A: i'm okay 

6.15 7.00 B: [laughter] 

7.84 14.91 A: so the topic for the day is um is fifteen dol- fifteen ah um five fifteen minimum wage enough 

14.43 15.79 B: yeah 

15.26 16.10 A: no 

15.99 22.11 B: [laughter] no [laughter] okay why why not [laughter] 

16.46 17.68 A: [laughter] 

17.86 19.25 A: absolutely 

21.37 22.79 A: because 

22.96 27.15 A: people need to live and with the 

24.80 25.82 B: right 

27.32 33.18 A: inflation costs of basically everything [noise] food groceries shoes clothes 

30.24 31.02 B: right 

33.14 46.77 A: everything you can't live off of five fifteen you [noise] [noise] just it's too it's too hard [noise] [noise] and i mean y- they i think that they should increase the minimum wage to at least about eight or nine dollars 

36.06 37.11 B: right 

38.22 39.09 B: right 

46.27 47.39 B: right 

46.82 58.96 A: an hour because if we have enough money to give to all these different countries [noise] who the need of this and need of that then we have money to pay our own people half way decent 

59.05 60.19 B: right 

59.42 61.29 A: [noise] [noise] bottom line 

60.95 72.01 B: bottom line [laughter] you're right i mean if we have the money to send over all these ships and bomb let's say iraq [laughter] 

62.07 64.61 A: [noise] [laughter] yeah [noise] 

70.85 72.27 A: right 

72.29 74.40 B: we should definitely have the money to 

74.76 76.59 B: increase minimum wage 

76.39 81.14 A: yeah because i work for five fifteen when i work 

76.98 77.91 B: yeah 

79.92 81.88 B: uh-huh oh you do 

81.49 86.12 A: when i i did when i was younger and i have two children 

82.77 84.00 B: oh okay 

84.24 85.21 B: right 

85.94 87.09 B: right 

86.36 88.86 A: and i could barely make it 

88.44 89.58 B: right 

89.35 104.24 A: and at least if they increase the minimum wage a little bit someone could go out and get a part time job and at least be making about ten total but now at five fifteen you have to go out and get another full time job just to get to ten 

97.44 99.23 B: right right 

104.03 106.64 B: right yeah but that's not right yeah 

105.41 107.95 A: ye- yeah i mean that's ridiculous 

107.36 109.39 B: that is totally ridiculous 

108.77 112.53 A: and we have so many people who come over here from different 

112.56 122.66 A: ah countries and different backgrounds and they're saying united states the land of the free but you're working for basically nothing how are these people supposed to live 

118.03 119.70 B: [laughter] 

122.47 126.41 B: right exactly exactly absolutely 

123.10 124.78 A: (( you you know what i'm saying )) 

125.76 135.99 A: and if minimum wage was more i do believe that we wouldn't be giving away so much money in government you know like welfare things like that 

135.38 136.40 B: right 

136.08 138.93 A: because people would have no problem going out getting a job mm 

136.74 137.66 B: right 

138.32 139.99 B: right exactly 

140.14 141.68 B: no it seems to be 

141.27 149.38 A: but actually 'cause i used to get social services [noise] um and they pay more than minimum wage 

141.86 142.85 B: a little 

144.69 145.62 B: uh-huh 

149.59 154.67 B: really see i really don't know much about this [laughter] so educate me 

150.33 151.74 A: yeah so 

154.51 163.85 A: yeah i when i got a social services it basically works like this if you don't work at all and you don't do absolutely nothing than sit home they will pay you 

159.51 160.30 B: uh-huh 

161.99 162.93 B: uh-huh 

163.92 165.94 A: (( about six hundred dollars a month )) 

165.92 166.85 B: huh 

166.41 170.19 A: based on how many children you have like if you have one 

170.29 172.68 A: and yourself they'll pay you about five 

172.29 173.35 B: (( okay okay )) 

172.96 175.85 A: if you have another one they'll pay you about six 

175.38 177.11 B: mhm 

176.12 180.06 A: in d._c. they pay like a grand per child 

180.37 181.73 B: wow 

181.19 182.46 A: (( you know what i'm saying )) 

181.78 184.14 B: just because it's more expensive to live there 

183.43 184.48 A: right 

184.26 185.15 B: uh-huh 

184.89 186.57 A: ah but i'm saying 

186.82 190.13 A: the minute you go out and get a job let's say you go out 

189.25 191.61 B: yeah you don't get that anymore right

201.65 204.96 A: the state you know what i'm saying [noise] i'm making the about the same thing 

202.60 210.25 B: absolutely yeah exactly i might as well stay home and you know take care of my kids or do whatever 

209.71 214.10 A: [noise] right exactly that that that's not helping anybody do anything 

213.85 227.75 B: that is not helping at all and it's helping people that do work and that pay you know it it's hurting people that do work and pay taxes because i'm going to have to increase taxes [laughter] on people that do work because people say [mn] why should i work i can just stay at home 

223.75 224.90 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] exactly [noise] ))

258.95 268.52 B: (( mcdonalds is a rough one [laughter] like you know you're hot you're running around people are grumpy and hungry [laughter] ))

290.05 292.87 B: yeah have some coffee [laughter] 

292.24 294.13 A: hey how 'bout that 

293.46 295.45 B: yeah [laughter]

573.09 579.05 B: (( exactly [laughter] )) 

574.58 577.86 A: [laughter] [noise] right though 

578.03 584.03 A: i think that yeah i think i'm going to write somebody in congress or something like that 

579.83 581.12 B: yeah 

583.90 593.65 A: to see if we can make a change or the or you know minimum wage is for some people even less than that because like people waitresses
