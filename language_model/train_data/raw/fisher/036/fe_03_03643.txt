0.47 2.47 B: hi i'm renee worder 

2.32 11.02 B: um i would say that uh the minimum wage depends on uh what job you have um i had a job once in uh santa clara california it was uh 

10.83 25.36 B: uh room service position which is kinda like being a waitress and you deliver things from rooms and pick up things it can be anything besides food but then you get tips too and we get the share in the tips so it didn't really matter uh which person went to wh- what room at the end when the person 

25.35 32.08 B: checked they would leave a a major tip [laughter] for like all the room service that they got while they were staying at the westin hotel 

32.09 44.00 B: um over in santa clara and um we usually got quite a bit i mean it ended up being like maybe eight nine dollars sometimes maybe a little less maybe a little more so it really depends on the position 

44.08 49.80 B: and uh i think that the supervisors at the time knew that five fifteen would be 

50.89 59.44 B: usually i mean they well they did say that we usually get more than that anyways so um they they knew that we probably at least get seven dollars per hour on average so 

59.54 65.62 B: um it really does d- um depend on the job [lipsmack] um and the place that you work at the same time 

65.95 67.79 B: um i would say that 

68.10 76.08 B: some companies aren't going to be fair and they don't have tips and so possibly six dollars per hour might be better for minimum wage 

77.41 79.92 A: huh i i'm john by the way 

79.59 82.86 B: oh hi i [laughter] i didn't know i had a partner [laughter] 

83.07 84.16 A: um 

84.40 88.14 A: y- yeah responding on the on the minimum wage 

87.50 88.39 B: mhm 

88.26 92.25 A: uh i've never had a minimum wage uh job [laughter] in my life 

91.86 92.90 B: (( mhm )) 

92.63 96.19 A: unfortunately and fortunately so i really don't know that side of the uh 

96.25 106.42 A: of the fence but i mean five dollars an hour just seems awfully low but then again usually th- those are part time jobs and for jobs for people in school 

106.13 107.02 B: uh-huh 

106.46 113.32 A: who don't need a lot of money you know i'd hate to tax the you know the small businesses 

113.24 122.54 A: to the point where now they have to start closing their doors 'cause they can't afford to operate a- and how you lose the additional income within the economy 

117.77 118.87 B: (( mhm )) 

122.09 125.31 B: true i mean of course you have to consider the business and the 

125.50 129.69 B: the employee too i mean both have their their rights of course to a point 

129.56 132.37 A: right i- it's just like taxes it's a fine line 

130.06 130.98 B: you know 

130.95 144.21 B: and i've never been a manager and owner of a business so i don't know exactly what they're dealing with and you know i know that certain ones are going to be unfair and take advantage of the minimum wage and other ones might just give it to people 'cause they don't care about their income but [sigh] 

143.22 144.21 A: (( right right )) 

144.00 149.14 B: it does seem like maybe there should be a well obviously a minimum wage and at least there is one but 

149.20 156.38 B: um i mean at the time when i i was working i mean i got like four twenty five for [laughter] minimum wage so it was a lot less but 

156.40 157.43 B: um 

157.64 167.32 B: it it does seem like you would need to have at least two part time jobs obviously or full time if you did get minimum wage and only five fifteen because r- rent i mean you're lucky 

167.39 171.95 B: if you find something that's uh under five hundred dollars per month you know 

172.36 174.68 B: so you wouldn't have [laughter] too much spending money 

175.21 176.13 B: um 

176.70 182.02 B: you wo- you said you never worked at any minimum wage job or anything close to it like six dollars per hour even when you were 

176.94 177.77 A: yeah 

181.98 183.48 A: well you know it's c- 

182.43 183.86 B: like years back or 

183.76 191.65 A: it's it's kinda kinda hard i was a lifeguard and i think i made like twelve dollars an hour back in high school i mean that was a lot of money back then 

186.92 187.78 B: mhm 

190.21 193.75 B: mhm well that's a good for a high school person [laughter] 

192.88 197.11 A: yeah but you only did it like you know two hours a night or something ridiculous i mean 

196.50 197.45 B: mhm 

197.47 202.38 A: and then um and then i think the worse i ever made was thirteen dollars an hour 

202.06 203.37 B: mhm 

202.80 206.13 A: but that was a- as an airline pilot and uh 

206.53 219.12 A: and you know that was [laughter] on seventy five hours over the month so i guess that probably would be minimum wage actually a little bit below it because i know i only made like ten thousand and uh i was scrimping 

212.81 213.72 B: right 

219.20 224.89 A: and uh but it was exempt from minimum wage anyway so that we may even been below that i don't know 

224.69 227.25 B: what jobs can you see uh 

227.25 234.33 B: a person getting minimum wage for i mean like sweeping i mean some of that stuff is really easy and i mean i know it could be hard work but what if they just 

232.08 232.95 A: well 

234.12 242.44 B: say take it easy just sweep a little here and there they don't have to hurry there's no deadlines or like stuffing envelopes or someth- you know what i'm saying it seems like some jobs would be 

242.46 251.27 B: i mean would pay no more than maybe six dollars per hour at the most [laughter] i have to admit that but at the same time i don't know if sometimes they can should consider the person 

251.39 259.03 B: uh and how much well i mean the average person has so many bills you know and maybe they should consider that too and 

256.24 257.29 A: right 

259.05 267.99 A: well you're also looking at as a as a starting point i mean nobo- nobody's gonna sit at minimum wage the rest of their life if they do they have other issues 

259.29 260.61 B: i don't know [laughter] 

266.67 269.57 B: true true they could always try different jobs 

269.63 277.14 A: yeah i mean uh the person who's gonna get minimum wage has no work history no education um really no desire 

275.72 288.52 B: yeah what if they're an and nothing against the immigrants but what if they are new and they can't help it and they don't know english good and and so that hurts their their position too because the the employer wants them to speak english but they only speak a little bit but they hire 'em anyways 

288.53 300.81 B: and then uh they only do the or they're handicapped or whatever and of course they deserve to have a chance and what if they pay 'em a little less because of um the way they do the job or something i mean i don't know if it should be that way or not either 

289.09 290.47 A: (( [laughter] yeah but )) 

301.68 303.18 A: well notoriously 

301.71 309.64 B: um actually i don't think it has to do with that how well they perform i think they just pick somebody and whoever gets it they do pay 'em the same amount all the time [laughter] 

309.12 311.42 A: right i i mean i 

311.31 324.14 A: like i said i really don't have a lot of experience i mean i've witnessed people who who make minimum wage and [noise] you get you get what you pay for [laughter] i mean y- you pay a minimum wage you're gonna get mi- minimal performance right [lipsmack] 

316.36 317.34 B: (( mhm )) 

319.06 319.92 B: right 

323.49 333.70 B: oh you know what too is there's also jobs not just like waitressing type jobs or room service things like that where you get tips but there's also jobs where uh instead of giving you straight commission like sales jobs 

333.63 345.27 B: y- you know let's say if you get a job where it's all commission they usually give you a lot of the commission they give you like forty or fifty percent of the sale and and like the sale could be like several hundred dollars so you might get half of that for one sale 

340.53 341.56 A: right 

345.18 353.60 B: so let's say you wanna feel a little secure so that you think it's you would think it was nice to have at least five fifteen per hour in addition to commission 

353.51 365.14 B: so that i look at that as extra and that would be nice fund to have the minimum wage and i wouldn't expect anything else because i have tried for different sales jobs whether it be face to face sales you know when you kinda dress up in a 

366.45 367.29 B: hello 

367.22 369.62 A: yeah are you still there 

368.84 374.88 B: okay i don't know if our ten minutes is up but anyways i'll keep going um [laughter] i don't know if um 

377.19 379.05 B: okay did you push a button or something 

379.04 381.26 A: no i haven't 

381.01 389.56 B: okay anyways um yeah it doesn't matter if it was like face to face type sales or telemarketing like over the phone or it was more formal or not i mean some 

389.60 391.83 B: i meant they they normally 

391.92 402.78 B: uh like if they give you a lot of commission they give you only commission or a l- a small wage just to for for the times that are tougher on you or you're calling a bad area 

402.92 406.93 B: you know where people don't have as much money or whatever so at least you have something 

407.70 417.70 B: to fall back on if [laughter] you know you're not doing good with sales or like when you're you're first training in a sales position they might give you a minimum wage and then they get rid of that 

407.71 408.58 A: right 

418.13 421.19 B: and give you a higher commission or straight commission 

421.55 428.87 B: and then that motivates you more but then you don't have no wage at all you know or no you know um minimum per hour so 

429.13 430.39 A: yeah i 

429.42 434.57 B: i think it it can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it could be motivating or it can be uh 

434.91 444.35 B: you know like i said depends on if it's sales or if you get tips otherwise it would be very low for five fifteen and it seems to me it should be at least six dollars per hour you'd think 

444.35 450.74 A: well you know i i i would hate to jack it up you know just right now because 

449.41 455.22 B: well it's true you do have to think about yeah you do i mean we would have to know more about different businesses and what they're dealing with 

455.23 465.78 B: i guess to know how much it should be raised i mean i'm the type who'd wanna analyze it all [laughter] you know and i i wouldn't just be sure so sure of myself to say exactly what it should be either but 

459.92 460.76 A: right 

467.21 474.24 A: yeah i i i'm just siding right now with my limited knowledge i'd probably side with the businesses because business are 

472.51 473.41 B: (( mhm )) 

473.53 474.64 B: (( i might mhm )) 

474.27 479.92 A: are are suffering right now and and everybody's taking pay cuts across the board i mean 

480.24 489.65 A: i mean i know people who hundreds of people thousands of people are unemployed right now you know they're all taking pay cuts just to stay employed you know and um 

490.29 501.63 A: you know five dollars an hour i mean it's not great but it's a starting point where you could probably you know pay some bills get a small apartment on your own you know at least get your foot in the in the light 

500.92 508.76 B: yeah you you could you could make it if you cut down enough or or hopefully they wouldn't have too many kids or anything you know if they did have kids [laughter] 

506.65 514.42 A: well i mean yeah i i i i just honestly don't think that there's that many jobs out there that literally pay minimum wage i mean 

513.83 514.73 B: true 

514.58 521.03 A: hell mcdonald's and burger king and everything else i mean you see seven fifty twelve you know whatever it is in the window 

520.23 522.65 B: some of them too might be like picking 

522.75 537.66 B: berries or something or pickin' vegetables [laughter] you know out of a garden or something but then some of those jobs can be tougher in a way i mean they're not mentally challenging but they can be it can be so darn boring and then you you're in the hot sun and i mean depending on what you don't like and i mean i hate being around bugs 

525.47 526.77 A: (( out of a right )) 

530.44 531.35 A: right 

537.85 552.34 B: you know as a little kid i got paid something like five dollars once for picking a bunch of berries and it wasn't a job but i mean it i and then i read stuff uh years later about how they have certain migrant workers and stuff getting paid minimum wage for picking 

552.17 558.65 B: fruits and vegetables and that's all they do all day but that's that can be kinda tiring and you have bugs around you and it's hot 

558.81 559.80 B: you know 

559.34 561.02 A: yeah yeah 

560.10 568.15 B: and there's people who sweep floors and have [laughter] just wipe off counters and stuff and that's all they do is clean or something and then they probably have it easier 

568.82 571.34 B: depending on how quick they have to move and 

568.92 570.61 A: but then again you 

570.96 576.11 A: don't like it you get a little bit more education and a little bit more experience and move on yeah 

573.99 574.86 B: true 

575.02 582.14 B: true and it is up to the the the business and the employer it's up to them but it's it is nice to have something at least 

582.74 586.35 B: similar to or around five fifteen i guess 

586.54 589.01 A: i mean i i i w- i 

589.45 599.89 A: [laughter] i won't argue with you know legislature uh that's already set at you know have they've spent a whole lot more time uh thinking this out than we have in the last uh four or five minutes or whatever it is
