0.13 3.19 B: hi my name is stacy cavanaugh i live in new york city [laughter] 

3.21 8.18 A: um hi my name is andrea and i live in ah deerjack michigan 

9.67 14.17 A: um so what do [laughter] yeah what do you think about the minimum wage it's 

10.79 12.17 B: (( oh yeah [laughter] )) 

13.51 24.83 B: i i think it should be more than five fifteen an hour [laughter] yeah i lived in los angeles before and it was five seventy five and i don't even think that's really all that much you know for somebody to make 

16.68 17.82 A: yeah 

23.75 24.68 A: yeah 

24.87 26.27 B: what do you think [laughter] 

26.02 38.48 A: um yeah and it and it really depends on what area of the country you live in too 'cause there are some areas where the cost of living is so much higher that minimum wage won't even barely get you by and then 

30.18 31.17 B: (( absolutely )) 

36.99 42.12 B: yeah like in new york that would never cover your rent at all you know much less your food or necessities [laughter] 

38.53 40.26 A: yeah yeah 

41.08 52.51 A: right but then there's other places ah you know like some places down south where you can rent places for dirt cheap and and that might be enough for somebody if they're you know single and don't have kids um 

51.91 56.83 B: right yes but it's i mean i think it's hard if especially if somebody has children or something 

53.03 54.42 A: yeah 

56.56 57.45 A: yeah 

57.05 70.29 B: um in santa monica california they have like a living wage law where the city takes what the minimum wage is despite what the federal minimum wage and it's like up to ten bucks an hour there for people that live in ho- ah that work in hotels and things like that you know 

60.68 61.67 A: mhm 

65.25 66.10 A: uh-huh 

68.05 68.99 A: wow 

69.05 70.01 A: (( yeah )) 

70.90 79.49 A: yeah yeah i don't know five dollars and fifteen cents if you work forty hours that's like what two hundred dollars a week 

78.66 81.95 B: two hundred a week yeah and then they take taxes out on that [laughter] you know 

80.98 83.94 A: yeah i mean that's really not very much 

83.25 85.28 B: yeah it's really not that much at all 

85.05 97.66 A: you think that'd pay for a car and insurance and your house or your rent for your apartment or you know and then clothes and food and a- a- all that and gas and and you know oil for your car and 

98.10 100.69 A: it's hard to get by on that 

99.89 105.89 B: yeah i think it's really hard to get by what do you think about like small business owners ah do you think it's hard for them to pay people more or 

105.75 109.08 A: um yeah it probably um 

109.70 116.77 A: probably well it's it's a cost of doing business and i guess whatever their product is they just have to make the price of their product a little bit higher 

116.32 119.22 B: i agree [laughter] yeah [laughter] 

117.05 123.45 A: you know in order to [laughter] afford to pay i mean you have to pay a decent wage to your workers it's not fair if you don't 

122.46 124.76 B: yeah it's really not fair to the people at all 

124.64 125.53 A: right 

125.69 132.09 B: and when jobs are so hard to come by right now anyway you know the economy's not doing so well and people really need to get a living wage you 

128.22 129.32 A: yeah 

129.78 130.73 A: right 

131.88 132.72 A: yeah 

133.76 146.44 A: yep and and it's even harder though when you think about the third world countries where people work for you know pennies [laughter] yeah and then all the companies can go over there and it's cheaper for them to do business if they hire these people that 

139.30 141.73 B: (( know pennies yeah absolutely )) 

146.21 150.25 A: you know are willing to work for that 'cause to them it's that or starve you know 

149.82 160.10 B: yeah that's true i mean i don't know if america losses a lot of business to other countries because of the minimum wage laws you know maybe with major i mean like nike and people like that that employ people in mexico 

157.82 158.79 A: mhm 

160.21 161.07 B: (( you know )) 

161.01 162.01 A: yeah 

161.55 163.96 B: but i still yeah i still think it'd be better for 

164.02 167.16 B: you know people to get a wage that they can actually live on you know 

167.16 168.79 A: yes definitely 

168.77 174.56 B: yeah i think unions and everything like that are a great idea too to make sure people are making the money that they deserve you know 

174.13 185.80 A: yeah yeah as long as as long as the union i don't know i belong i went i worked at a um at at a store as a cashier and you had to belong to the union 

185.46 186.53 B: oh really 

185.91 200.40 A: and you had to pay dues to the union so it's like you're working this job where you're getting minimum wage and you have to pay you know a certain amount a month to this union as far as i can tell the union didn't do anything [laughter] you know it was just like 

187.65 189.21 B: pay dues yeah 

198.02 202.54 B: that's terrible [laughter] the unions need to be regulated too by the people or something 

200.63 213.71 A: you know you just had it it was a- a- and i i had thought that they had already passed laws that you can't it's called a closed shop and you couldn't have that where you're forced to bel- but if if you had if you worked at this place you had to pay dues and you had to belong to the union 

213.53 214.88 B: that's crazy 

213.61 219.68 A: it was part of the union's contract with the store that all the employees had to [laughter] pay to a union 

219.10 221.06 B: wow and you still made minimum wage 

219.70 220.51 A: like 

221.06 222.97 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

221.90 225.80 B: oh yeah you'd think the unions should fight for that and better benefits you know 

224.86 225.89 A: yeah 

226.18 237.13 A: yeah and it's like and if you worked part time which is what they tried to do is make most of their workers part time you didn't get any benefits all you got you know [laughter] it's like what is the point of this union you know 

232.88 235.67 B: that's terrible that's terrible 

235.88 238.47 B: yeah what's the point and then you're paying dues on top of that 

237.80 247.40 A: yeah and you had and it wasn't like a huge amount but it was still you know a certain amount every month came out of your pay check a couple of dollars to pay the union it was just very strange 

245.41 247.65 B: yeah that's not really good at all 

247.83 249.41 A: so yeah 

251.02 259.15 B: yeah well yeah but five fifteen definitely [laughter] is not i didn't even think it was still five fifteen i thought it was five thirty five already or something 

254.63 255.58 A: yeah 

256.72 257.90 A: (( yeah )) 

258.68 263.29 A: yeah i don't know and it's like every time they want to raise the minimum wage l- 

263.41 269.87 A: like congress has to fight over it and people you know and it's like why don't they just do it [laughter] you know 

268.45 272.75 B: let's do it already yeah it shouldn't have to be i mean those guys aren't making anything like 

269.98 278.53 A: yeah i mean the congressmen they would they make way more than minimum wage themselves where they can you know what do they you know beefing about 

272.79 273.73 B: (( it [laughter] )) 

273.75 275.62 B: way more than minimum wage 

276.95 291.26 B: they should have to live on minimum wage for a week [laughter] and see what it's like [laughter] no it's terrible it's terribly low i mean even in small i think even in small towns it barely you know barely meets your living costs i mean even if you did live you know 

278.64 279.65 A: yeah 

280.62 281.76 A: yeah 

289.22 290.11 A: yeah 

291.74 295.25 B: backward you know alabama [laughter] or something i think it would still be 

293.88 295.11 A: yeah 

295.26 302.52 B: not enough money to make you know especially a lot of most working class people i think have children you know most people making minimum wage do 

296.71 298.05 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

300.58 301.42 A: (( yeah )) 

302.30 303.37 A: yeah 

303.63 307.06 B: h- how is it in michigan do they have a state wage there 

306.49 313.05 A: um i don't think so i think a- as far as i know they don't it's just they just go by the federal minimum wage 

312.23 315.11 B: go by the federal everywhere i've lived i think they have their own 

313.20 313.84 A: yeah 

314.71 315.92 A: (( mhm )) 

315.28 325.47 B: um their own state wages you know i know california there was just nothing there it's just six and a quarter from five seventy five you know so i think people there really fight for [laughter] 

317.55 318.49 A: (( [noise] mm )) 

321.79 323.03 A: yeah 

324.79 326.30 A: [noise] yeah [noise] 

326.37 328.60 A: yeah 'cause it's expensive out there 

327.98 329.93 B: (( yeah 'cause we've relations live out there )) 

330.26 331.40 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

331.28 343.14 B: but then there's people that still go you know and hire [mn] and people without paying the minimum wage there's so many cash jobs and people that employ people under the table to to get away with not paying the minimum wage you know 

340.64 341.56 A: (( yeah )) 

342.46 343.83 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

343.82 346.17 B: so i guess it kind of goes back and forth [laughter] 

345.84 346.86 A: right 

348.47 349.63 A: yep 

351.15 352.64 A: (( yeah i don't know i don't )) 

352.73 355.97 A: i i'm an author so i work from home and i 

356.39 362.44 A: so i don't i don't even yeah i don't keep touch with what the minimum wage is anymore 'cause i'm not working [noise] out there in 

362.98 364.40 A: (( [noise] in the )) 

364.98 366.94 A: as a anything anymore 

366.60 374.14 B: yeah i work from home too but i have a like a small business but i don't really have any employees i guess if i were to get employees then 

372.40 373.33 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

374.26 377.11 B: yeah it might affect me [laughter] you know the opposite way 

376.01 378.17 A: yeah yeah that's true 

377.77 385.98 B: but um i still you know even if i had employees i'd still probably at least pay them six dollars an hour because you really can't live on that you know not at all 

384.02 385.06 A: yeah 

385.92 391.53 A: yeah i mean if you're like a retired person and you're just doing it for like to supplement 

391.18 392.18 B: right 

391.53 402.96 A: you know some other income or something work part time and you know live off your retirement funds and whatever source you have um then it might be enough but if it's what you really need to live on i mean five dollars 

403.10 405.34 A: and fifteen cents is not enough 

405.24 413.94 B: yeah i think like maybe even state programmes should take into account um you know like a welfare program or something like that should take into account like supplemental income you know 

410.69 411.71 A: yeah 

413.56 414.97 A: yeah 

413.92 418.86 B: 'cause i think you really can't get welfare checks through any sort of special um 

418.70 428.70 B: you know any sort of special money you know extra money if you do make minimum wage even if you do have children and maybe they should i mean if they want to keep the minimum wage low change that to 

420.70 421.87 A: mhm 

423.26 424.58 A: yeah 

425.59 426.54 A: yeah 

428.48 434.73 B: you know people that qualify for extra money you know or live in bigger cities or have a lot of children you know that need extra 

429.93 431.22 A: yeah 

433.41 434.43 A: yeah 

434.92 441.29 A: yeah from what i've heard in michigan that if you're on welfare it doesn't even pay minimum wage [laughter] you know it's like 

439.99 442.05 B: yeah i don't think it does at all 

441.51 442.64 A: and um 

442.67 452.17 A: a- well i mean in michigan they have this big we- welfare to work thing that they i mean they were one of the first states to get into that so they really i- i- if you're receiving 

448.69 449.88 B: mhm 

452.35 454.86 A: welfare you're required to 

454.96 456.06 A: work 

456.00 465.83 A: for forty hours a week if you're not working then you have to be spend forty hours a week and document that you are searching for a job for forty hours a week well if you live in a small town 

465.22 469.17 B: [laughter] yeah and searching for a job right 

465.74 472.89 A: i mean and you could go to every business three times a day and and you know in in order to get forty hours worth but 

472.21 476.00 B: right and then you just keep harassing people who you never [laughter] 

473.06 473.70 A: (( [mn] )) 

474.16 481.31 A: yes i know i'm sorry but i have to come back again i know i was here yesterday but you know i've got to get my forty hours in that's a [mn] 

477.73 479.62 B: right [laughter] 

479.75 482.09 B: nobody would ever give you a job that way 

481.67 482.82 A: yeah 

482.20 488.32 B: yeah i think so any state programs you know really just need a change [laughter] they just actually don't end up helping people at all 

485.56 486.61 A: yeah 

487.98 489.02 A: yeah 

488.62 489.47 B: (( you know )) 

489.80 495.63 B: in los angeles there's a lot of actors of course unemployed actors you know and they um 

494.28 495.34 A: mhm 

495.87 499.76 B: they have a the way their unemployment system works out there is if you're an actor 

499.88 507.71 B: and then you can prove that you're searching for acting jobs you can get unemployment and um even when you're working like if you work one or two jobs a week 

505.61 506.45 A: (( mm )) 

507.20 508.30 A: interesting 

507.78 512.45 B: they have like a supplemental unemployment i think they should have something like that maybe with minimum wage 

511.85 513.17 A: yeah 

512.80 515.87 B: you know i mean that doesn't really help people with children it's you 

515.93 519.53 B: know i mean honestly it keeps people unemployed [laughter] i think but um 

516.56 517.49 A: right 

518.35 519.29 A: yeah 

519.66 523.00 B: you know they should maybe work something out like that where if you're making 

523.09 527.49 B: a certain amount of money and it doesn't meet your bills you know you should be able to get some sort of government assistance 

527.17 528.34 A: (( yes )) 

528.29 530.99 B: ah i i guess i'm a little bit liberal minded but [laughter] 

530.08 531.80 A: i guess yeah 

531.08 532.17 B: yeah 

532.60 533.88 A: (( yeah i don't know )) 

533.54 537.28 B: people need to eat [laughter] right [laughter] 

534.94 536.32 A: yes that's true 

537.04 540.88 A: and i mean you can you can find cheaper food to eat than 

541.41 550.70 A: you know 'cause i i don't make a lot i [laughter] live on very little [laughter] i i probably live on i probably live on way less than minimum wage right now but it's hard 

544.34 545.56 B: (( right i do to )) 

547.13 552.56 B: yeah i do too [laughter] i hate working for yourself it's hard it is very hard [laughter] 

550.81 564.87 A: you know and it's like i get tired of eating you know beans and rice and [laughter] yes spaghetti and you know cheap stuff that doesn't cost too much macaroni and cheese and all that stuff but yeah 

555.16 557.63 B: (( spaghetti [laughter] )) 

561.34 562.47 B: right 

562.54 565.17 B: yeah it really is hard 

565.16 566.58 A: yes it is 

565.90 571.35 B: but at least i mean i know i'm choosing what i'm doing you know and a lot of people really can't 

568.77 569.89 A: yeah 

571.49 575.16 B: do you know and then can only get minimum wage jobs you know 

574.30 575.09 A: right 

575.34 587.61 B: those people really i think deserve [laughter] i don't know a little bit of a better chance you know and their children do too you know a kid can't be going to school without a lunch or you know being able to have pin folds or whatever if their mother's not making enough money 

579.56 580.64 A: yeah 

581.17 582.01 A: (( yes )) 

583.52 584.42 A: right 

587.20 588.16 A: yeah 

588.04 589.03 B: (( you know )) 

588.92 589.66 A: yeah 

589.77 593.72 B: plus i think people that have minimum wage jobs tend to work really hard too you know 

592.86 593.77 A: (( yeah )) 

593.85 599.89 A: it's e- it seemed like the minimum wage jobs are the worst jobs you know the ones where you have to work the hardest and 

596.99 599.47 B: (( i think they are yeah [laughter] ri ))
