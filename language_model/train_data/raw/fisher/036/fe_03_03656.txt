0.00 1.82 B: hi i'm andrea 

1.58 3.59 A: (( hi i'm kadesha )) 

3.39 4.43 B: hello 

4.16 5.32 A: hi 

5.41 8.40 B: uh so talk about the minimum wage 

7.96 10.03 A: i'm not hearing you properly 

9.91 11.80 B: okay um 

11.96 18.16 B: i think that it should i think that it should be increased i don't think that five fifteen an hour is sufficient 

19.13 21.67 A: [mn] i'm still not hearing you for whatever reason 

20.76 22.38 B: (( oh i'm sorry um )) 

21.89 24.05 A: are you soft spoken 'cause 

24.54 26.07 B: a little bit [laughter] 

25.34 27.06 A: okay all right 

26.99 27.91 B: um 

27.17 29.96 A: i- if you speak a little louder i might be able to hear you 

29.75 30.63 B: okay 

30.67 37.82 B: um i i just think that the minimum wage is not sufficient at five fifteen an hour 

38.68 47.29 A: yeah i agree with you totally because five fifteen an hour if that that's eight hours say you work a full time job right eight hours to the day 

45.60 46.49 B: uh-huh 

47.28 60.94 A: say roughly that's forty something dollars for the day well how can you really survive on you know like two hundred dollars for the week 'cause i mean we live in new york so rent in new york is like extremely expensive 

53.43 54.32 B: exactly 

55.44 56.36 B: exactly 

60.82 61.85 B: (( yeah )) 

61.24 62.11 A: um 

62.22 72.41 A: for somebody who works for minimum wage and have to support like a family and stuff and buy food and pay rent and stuff that's going to be really hard 

72.39 79.67 A: so i think at least it should be at least like seven dollars or eight dollars they should go up a notch like you know 

79.54 80.35 B: yes 

80.30 81.94 A: and set it up to that 

80.45 81.21 B: i 

81.76 85.20 B: i definitely agree with you on that um and i mean 

83.25 85.91 A: yeah i think it's too low 

85.75 93.33 B: yeah i think it is too low too i mean there are a lot of states that like have their own minimum wage that's like above 

87.31 88.30 A: mhm 

93.45 99.36 B: the federal one like in massachusetts it's six dollars and seventy five cents an hour 

98.98 100.13 A: right 

99.56 102.71 B: um and that that's pretty good that's that's 

101.67 104.32 A: mhm that is yeah i guess that's okay 

104.06 109.17 B: yeah but i mean like it also depends on you know where you'd be living because 

109.01 122.64 B: if you're living in like a small town in massachusetts then you have yo- you're making enough money minimum wage but if you live in boston which is really expensive like six seventy five in many cases might not be enough 

114.98 115.91 A: uh-huh 

122.10 123.03 A: right 

123.13 127.54 B: so i think like that should be taken into consideration because 

126.87 127.71 A: right 

127.65 129.22 B: you know or maybe 

128.20 138.81 A: yeah totally i agree with you at that um [lipsmack] but i think even so i mean what's the motivation behind it you know when you work you want to get paid 

138.54 139.80 B: right 

138.97 139.97 A: you know 

139.82 144.76 A: and working for like five fifteen or even six seventy five an hour you know 

144.33 145.21 B: mhm 

144.57 146.60 A: that's still a little bit of money 

146.41 158.05 A: because i mean some employers they okay they say okay this is the minimum wage this is we go- this is what we're going to pay you you understand there's nothing you can do about it and sometimes you're stuck in like a job 

153.33 154.13 B: right 

157.87 168.98 A: and they don't care they just give you minimum wage listen you have to work for that you know and you leave work feeling like you feel so drained i'm like what am i working for you know 

163.15 164.08 B: uh-huh 

168.59 173.54 B: exactly 'cause your money's not going to not going to go as far as you need it to go 

170.94 171.84 A: yeah 

171.92 176.59 A: because by the time you buy a pair of jeans and a pair of sneakers that's it 

176.21 178.39 B: that's all the money you have exactly 

177.25 178.25 A: yeah 

178.44 189.07 B: and like you know and and while you know five fifteen might be enough for somebody who's living by themselves maybe five fifteen's not enough if you have children or if you have a family 

184.78 185.97 A: (( [noise] right )) 

187.17 189.58 A: no definitely not 

189.15 191.37 B: medical bills things like that 

191.47 196.81 A: right and most of these companies their medical plans are now you know 

196.84 199.08 A: they're going real cheap on them 

198.94 200.04 B: yeah 

199.44 205.87 A: like they're not taking care of their employees well with like health plans and dental plans and stuff like that 

205.52 206.48 B: right 

205.88 215.11 A: so yeah definitely i agree with you they should go up i would say honestly if i was in that position i would at least put it for like eight dollars 

214.82 217.20 B: yes i agree i agree 

216.08 226.09 A: yeah eight dollars an hour because they're people i mean just i'm just sayin- saying for example in new york there are people who make like thirty forty dollars an hour 

225.79 227.02 B: correct yes 

226.37 236.69 A: you know and the distribution of wealth is you know very inconsistent across new york across the board you know i should say across the united states totally 

236.37 238.47 B: yes yes 

236.80 238.21 A: you know so 

238.29 240.18 A: definitely [laughter] 

239.53 241.12 B: [laughter] 

240.67 243.73 A: okay so what do we talk about again that's it 

243.12 253.61 B: well i was i was also thinking um [mn] i was living in oregon for a while and a lot of people in oregon there was like there was a campaign for a living wage 

247.89 248.92 A: mhm 

253.58 265.00 B: which is you know [noise] the the money you like an average person would need to live and that basically evens out to around thirteen or fourteen dollars an hour in order to like 

253.74 254.59 A: right 

263.92 265.61 A: mm that's good 

264.97 268.75 B: have a family and things like that and so [mn] you know 

266.94 267.89 A: yeah 

269.28 274.18 B: eight dollars an hour is def- is a definite improvement you know but 

272.21 273.39 A: yeah 

274.38 282.21 B: you know even more could be done it could be twelve thirteen fourteen dollars an hour especially in places that are more expensive to live 

275.05 275.88 A: yeah 

280.76 281.80 A: yeah 

281.86 288.60 A: and then too the o- the only thing the sad thing to that is that income tax is progressive in nature 

288.51 289.53 B: yes 

288.92 293.26 A: so the more you work for the more taxes you're going to have to pay anyway right 

292.87 294.14 B: yes yeah 

293.50 304.92 A: so you know that's something that too's going to make you okay oh my god i'm working for all this money and i still have to give away half of it you know that a deterrent for a lot of people too 

301.45 303.52 B: exactly exactly 

304.91 307.99 B: yeah yeah i mean because even if you're only making 

307.39 310.28 A: um can you hold for a second 

309.01 309.99 B: yes 

310.49 313.84 A: okay all right i'll probably have to just go into the machine 

313.63 314.43 B: (( okay ahah )) 

314.30 315.92 A: yeah so um 

316.74 324.61 A: to ask you i just did this over the internet i signed up for it right so we just talk about the topic and stuff 

324.18 325.24 B: yes 

324.88 329.75 A: so you guys call me like every day at eight o'clock or whatever and you just talk about the topic 

329.46 331.67 B: um i believe so yes 

331.30 333.29 A: and that's what we get paid for 

332.95 335.72 B: yeah ten dollars each each time 

333.64 334.54 A: oh 

335.71 341.42 A: right but um you know what one more question i don't know if i can ask you this how do we get paid 

336.46 337.21 B: yeah 

341.22 348.13 B: um i think like when you sign up on the internet you put in your your home address and then they they'll mail you a cheque 

345.58 346.58 A: right 

347.52 349.37 A: oh okay that's cool 

348.86 350.02 B: yeah 

349.78 352.58 A: yeah is this like a research thing 

352.33 356.21 B: yes yeah i- it's ah i guess it's for linguistic research 

355.64 356.80 A: right 

356.44 357.54 B: yeah 

357.28 359.17 A: oh okay that's good 

358.58 360.44 B: yeah 

359.81 362.70 A: yeah oh what do you get paid by the minute or something 

362.49 368.41 B: ah i get paid per call like you you can do up to three calls and you get ten dollars a per call 

368.07 369.47 A: oh okay 

369.11 370.16 B: yeah 

369.90 371.11 A: that's good 

370.69 371.76 B: (( yeah )) 

371.43 372.38 A: yeah 

373.20 375.20 A: you want to say anything to me again 

374.98 375.90 B: um 

376.24 379.57 B: [lipsmack] i can't really think of anything else [laughter] 

379.32 383.87 A: [laughter] yeah i think the the whole baseline of it yeah they should raise 

383.66 384.88 B: mhm 

384.21 387.98 A: the minimum wage i think five fifteen is too low 

387.74 394.02 B: that's it's extremely low it's extraordinarily low i mean there there aren't very many states that even 

389.32 390.38 A: yeah 

394.14 395.03 B: have 

394.50 397.27 A: acknowledge that being the minimum wage [noise] 

396.88 398.97 B: exactly exactly 

397.98 398.79 A: (( yeah i )) 

399.07 400.66 A: mean new york does 

401.14 411.20 A: like when you work in the colleges and stuff or if like you work a very low end paying jobs they're going employers are going to say to you look listen we pay minimum wage 

410.97 412.11 B: (( mhm )) 

411.49 415.83 A: you know and there are a lot of people sadly who work for minimum wage 

415.60 420.05 B: (( what is something that's like you know you're not going to live off that in new york city )) 

419.61 420.56 A: no 

420.34 421.76 B: there's no way 

420.77 424.30 A: definitely not in new york city an apartment in new york city 

424.62 428.41 A: can run you at least from fifteen hundred dollars up 

428.01 430.00 B: (( exactly [mn] )) 

428.89 430.04 A: (( you know )) 

430.44 431.26 A: so 

430.97 439.80 B: so it's just incredible i mean you know five fifteen an hour might be fine you know like if you live in like a small town or a really inexpensive place to live but 

439.19 440.26 A: mhm 

439.88 440.89 B: you know 

440.92 445.10 A: [mn] yeah like i have some friends who live out in um miami 

444.86 445.84 B: mhm 

445.49 454.55 A: and they actually say that you know the cost of living in miami's not really high like you can get a decent like a three bedroom apartment for like seven hundred dollars 

454.38 455.41 B: (( mhm )) 

455.08 460.43 A: you know and they some of them do get you know minimum wage and they actually survive you know 

460.02 461.05 B: yes 

460.44 470.85 A: 'cause they work forty sometimes fifty hours a week and they survive but i mean that is a strain you know it is a strain to work fifty hours a week and get paid five fifteen an hour 

470.90 477.90 A: and s- yo- you're not doing anything with your life you know you don't have the time to go back to school you know 

477.62 478.60 B: yeah 

477.99 482.98 A: and you don't have the time to do anything to improve your standard of living so 

482.22 483.69 B: exactly 

483.06 485.75 A: yeah they should raise it definitely 

485.53 486.57 B: i i 

485.77 487.84 A: how can we campaign against this 

487.73 491.70 B: yeah i i that you know what there's probably ways to do that i mean 

491.31 494.21 A: yeah write to albany or something 

493.81 496.80 B: (( yeah exactly exactly )) 

495.47 496.94 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

496.96 501.09 B: or like write to like senators you know in in in washington 

501.09 502.88 A: yeah so 

501.35 503.10 B: (( or something like that )) 

503.12 510.40 B: i guess if enough people were you know upset about it publicly then something would have to be done about it 

508.07 513.91 A: yeah that's true but [noise] [mn] a lot of the people um 

514.12 518.71 A: like it's not announced like you know i'm working for minimum wage 

518.26 519.17 B: mhm 

518.92 528.77 A: you know so even if you are upset about it i think people just live with it or deal with it you know or just stop working and go on unemployment or something 

524.64 525.67 B: right 

528.75 529.69 B: right 

529.39 530.66 A: (( you know so )) 

531.20 533.38 A: i guess most people just deal with it 

533.32 534.57 B: yeah 

534.98 536.49 B: (( which is unfortunate )) 

535.07 543.32 A: and i think too the low p- like i won't say the low paying jobs but like the jobs that the average american won't want to do 

543.07 543.89 B: uh-huh 

543.55 553.68 A: you know like the cleaning jobs and the restaurant jobs and stuff like that i think those are the jobs that pay like minimum wage and the workers have to um 

554.14 556.35 A: depend on their tips and stuff 

555.87 556.87 B: yes 

556.51 558.55 A: to make it through the night so 

558.74 561.60 A: definitely that's my point of view sweetie 

561.47 574.15 B: yeah i i completely agree with you i mean it it could be even more frustrating too i mean if you're like a waitress or something because there are a lot of places that you don't even get paid minimum wage because they say well oh you're making tips 

563.51 564.87 A: (( all right )) 

567.43 568.45 A: yeah 

574.06 578.11 B: so you don't need five dollars an hour we'll pay you two dollars or whatever 

576.30 580.33 A: that is so true i know some places pay people three dollars an hour 

579.87 588.22 B: exactly and i mean that's pretty terrible because like then you're completely reliant on you know how much how much business you get in the night 

582.43 583.28 A: yeah 

586.54 590.12 A: tips you make what if nobody visits the restaurant that night 

589.71 593.14 B: exactly then what are you going to do how are you going to you know pay your rent 

592.81 593.74 A: yeah 

593.83 599.24 A: and with the economy going the way it is a lot of people are rather staying home and cooking 

598.98 599.95 B: exactly
