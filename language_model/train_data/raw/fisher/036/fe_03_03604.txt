0.13 1.94 B: john from philly 

2.15 5.64 A: uh shaun from fort worth 

7.19 9.82 A: uh so what d'ya think 

9.51 12.16 B: uh what was the topic one more time 

11.56 14.53 A: uh i think minimum wage or something like that 

14.01 16.93 B: if you agree with th- minimum wage being raised 

16.78 18.85 A: (( yeah )) 

18.28 32.28 B: uh i agree that minimum wage should be raised uh just because just because i believe that that that w- isn't isn't based entirely off of i i just believe that there's a lot of a lot of uh [lipsmack] 

32.39 45.11 B: racism i know i'm talking circular but i believe that there's racism and and other type of of ways that people are are put down and minimal wage kinda goes against that it kinda protects that i guess 

40.74 41.94 A: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

42.88 57.27 A: yeah mhm yeah plus it um you know the economy just keeps rising and gets be- or or right now i wouldn't say that but you know like before before the war and everything it was pr- going pretty high so 

57.69 60.73 A: ever- i mean it's expected to go up anyways 

60.76 65.33 B: yeah yeah that's true too so you you think that it's good for the economy 

64.93 66.34 A: yeah 'cause i mean 

66.39 74.44 A: like back in the fifties maybe it would be a it was like maybe a dol- a dollar or something but now it's you know six dollars everything's been changed u- up so 

74.98 83.97 B: yeah yeah that's true i i don't know you could argue that well i mean so what minimum wage started in the depression right i think 

82.25 84.02 A: (( mhm i i guess )) 

84.52 86.82 B: (( i dun- i don- oh )) 

86.94 98.12 B: i- it could be seen that oh sometimes those federal programs that came around during the depression kinda like they were good then but they're kinda like outta date now but we're still trying to use 'em like 

97.00 98.76 A: mhm 

97.90 105.74 B: i don't know but but it it's also i think i don't know i think it's good i think i- go ahead 

103.00 104.74 A: yeah 

105.81 118.61 A: oh um i yeah 'cause i mean there's also some people that just lost jobs and you know they're going for like you know whatever they can get and you know if you still got a family to feed and everything you know that extra couple of bucks will help a lot so 

118.75 127.44 B: yeah yeah that's true uh i dunno i mean minimum wage is still really low i mean it's hard to have a family off the just minimum wage 

124.48 126.05 A: mhm 

126.43 127.57 A: (( yeah i know )) 

128.07 128.95 B: but 

129.70 130.52 B: i 

130.84 145.51 B: yeah it's i guess it's good just so that if if people come in here from other from other countries like if people came in from mexico just 'cause that's the easiest example just so they don't undercut workers but on the other hand it still happens anyway so 

145.12 146.82 A: mhm 

146.46 147.94 B: (( i don't um [lipsmack] )) 

147.99 149.06 B: (( i dunno )) 

149.50 151.23 A: yeah 

150.26 152.42 B: have you ever had to work for minimum wage 

152.50 156.53 A: me uh yeah well like for a golf course about a year ago 

157.05 159.44 B: oh wh- what was that 

158.95 160.80 A: i had to work at a golf course 

160.75 162.92 B: oh and you got minimum wage 

162.41 166.63 A: yeah like two years ago and that was like i think it was like four dollars and something 

168.15 169.06 A: so

191.43 192.41 B: oh really 

192.10 193.28 A: yeah 

192.76 195.52 B: do you wh- you know what school you're going to where you're going 

194.91 198.56 A: um trying to i'm try and go to north texas so 

198.70 201.15 B: oh all right all right 

200.60 201.96 A: (( yeah so )) 

202.50 208.14 B: is that a problem in texas with like people jumping the border and like undercutting american workers 

208.22 220.74 A: oh uh i'm sure that happens all the well every before um before the war and everything they i'm sure they did that all the time but like now after the war the coast uh the borders been like more secure and everything but you know 

220.80 227.25 A: they i mean there're still a lot of people that i mean i bet you we have a lot of it illegal immigrants around here still so 

220.99 222.88 B: yeah 

227.43 228.42 B: yeah 

227.71 234.76 A: and they found out ways 'cause i mean they can go all the way to california or new mexico and then come o- over here so 

234.60 236.23 B: yeah yeah that's true 

237.23 238.20 A: (( yeah so )) 

239.58 249.18 B: do you agree that like um well what do you think like do you think the federal government should have control over a minimum wage or you think it should be sanctioned off to the state 

249.59 250.68 A: (( um )) 

252.13 260.67 A: my i think i don't know 'cause see it's go or it the minimum wage are like all around the u._s. right or is it just uh [lipsmack] 

260.77 263.40 B: no it's a federal law yeah 

262.94 264.55 A: okay so it okay 

265.40 266.49 A: um 

267.38 269.68 A: well i don't know i i think it woul- 

270.13 274.38 A: if our government is responsible enough yeah go ahead and do that because 

274.34 283.38 A: i- it would also be like you know new york work minimum wage o- over there they'll probably have like i don't know ten bucks i'm just you know exaggerating but and over here in texas it's 

283.33 293.18 A: a lot of stuff is pretty cheap like uh so it maybe like four three or four dollars you know so i'm just exaggerating there too but i mean 'cause 

291.61 292.54 B: yeah 

293.48 302.91 A: what else in new york you know you have to pay for like uh par- parking and things like that and over here it's like you don't pa- pay for that stuff and i mean 

302.07 303.73 B: yeah 

303.45 304.65 A: (( so uh )) 

303.74 304.49 B: ye- 

305.52 312.27 A: like different states have di- uh different amount of money so uh you know it just i think it'll mess up our system or 

312.83 317.41 A: you know especially for when people who are moving from here to new york or anywhere else or 

313.05 314.05 B: yeah 

317.97 318.84 A: so 

320.12 321.20 A: that's why i 

320.33 326.80 B: yeah yeah it's kinda hard for like a federal government to generalize for like ev- every state 

326.11 328.19 A: mhm that's true too 

328.15 341.88 B: i i i dunno i guess i guess like if you just think about the minimum wage law it's like it's good because you want people to be able to make some minimum amount but it's shitty too because it just gives more power to the federal government which 

338.09 338.88 A: mhm 

341.29 342.46 A: yeah 

343.11 346.03 A: and who knows what they're gonna do with that money too 'cause 

346.37 354.18 A: i i i was watching the news one time and they said that uh they like had really nice rest area and there's 

354.25 367.98 A: i mean i i cost like a lot i don't know how much i forgot but i- i- it looks really nice on the outside and the inside it probably doesn't even work there's only one toilet and it's just like you know it's a waste of money it was and that was part of our tax dollar 

368.58 373.20 A: and that this is like a couple of years ago it's i felt i can't remember whether i think it was 

368.90 369.91 B: yeah 

373.86 379.17 A: i think uh i think it was in pennsylvania i'm not sure it's somewhere up north i can't remember but 

379.48 380.30 B: mm 

380.12 390.12 A: but i'm just saying like that for example you know if you were gonna put all that money into something like that you know and i mean what kinda people you have in the government you know 

390.38 391.25 A: so 

390.74 392.43 B: y- yeah 

393.66 399.35 B: so so you guys uh [laughter] are you guys in favor of uh george bush in texas 

399.16 400.50 A: uh 

400.68 406.00 A: yeah uh i guess you know we're be- we're behind him except for the dixie chicks [laughter] so 

405.56 407.97 B: ex- except for what the dixie chicks 

407.77 409.13 A: what's that 

408.72 410.39 B: except for what 

409.80 411.56 A: except for the dixie chicks 

411.22 414.29 B: [laughter] oh what they don't like him 

413.66 424.24 A: no i mean they're talking about uh they're all saying that he's not from texas and all this stuff and th- i mean you know if you look in the news and lot of the like people seem pretty happy you know 

424.30 425.83 A: and so it's like 

426.01 428.85 A: and so what if we didn't do anything either you know 

428.78 429.83 B: yeah 

430.81 431.60 A: (( i mean )) 

432.00 437.57 B: yeah well i don't think george bush is controlling minimum wage it's kinda been set in motion for a while 

437.23 439.07 A: mhm 

439.43 442.86 A: (( yeah that yeah i don't think he has anything to do with that though )) 

443.91 448.29 B: uh i'm sure he he's busy enough trying to start war 

444.35 446.30 A: (( mhm )) 

448.19 449.18 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

449.85 452.25 A: (( yeah )) 

453.18 455.01 B: what's that 

454.92 469.47 A: he he did a lot of stuff i mean like before the war like i think he was like working on like benefits and like el- elderly peoples and stuff and medications and all that but um but then after the war everything i guess is getting cut down so i 

469.40 477.03 B: yeah yeah kinda once war starts like everything shifts towards that like homeland homeland stops trying to change it 

476.12 478.35 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

477.45 479.42 B: (( but [cough] )) 

479.84 480.68 B: (( mm [lipsmack] ))
