14.69 16.21 A: yeah i guess so 

15.73 21.09 B: okay we'll have to go on this discussion i guess i thought they were gonna give us some sort of ah 

21.12 24.34 B: you know tell us when but i guess [laughter] they want us to 

22.52 28.75 A: yeah that's what i thought too [laughter] so what do what do what do you think is five fifteen enough 

24.46 25.33 B: yep 

28.29 34.94 B: no no not anywhere near the reason why i think it is if you don't mind me going first 

30.97 31.72 A: (( uh-huh )) 

34.22 35.49 A: go for it 

34.93 48.32 B: okay um because of today's ah high prices nobody can really um you know make a living and pay their bills or let's say a single person let's say a single mother or something or 

48.29 53.28 B: ah even just a single person not married couldn't couldn't do anything with that you know [lipsmack] 

52.36 56.06 A: mhm i would i entirely agree yeah i i 

54.70 56.44 B: that ah yeah 

56.23 68.73 A: think that there's a major argument that the corporations make is that oh you know they'll they'll they'll be forced to lay off workers if they have to raise it any higher but i i think that's just un- untrue when you look at the salaries that they're getting you know if they 

68.76 73.68 A: ditched down a little bit i think that they could could pay their workers substantially more 

73.70 82.16 B: that's correct and we are living in two thousand and three and those wages are from back at the nineteen sixties [laughter] 

81.13 83.80 A: (( uh-huh [laughter] yeah yeah )) 

82.22 84.64 B: (( well seventy eighty you know [noise] )) 

84.32 85.80 A: yeah 

85.51 88.07 B: but i think they're outrageous for 

88.08 89.88 B: people like us you know 

89.87 92.99 A: oh yeah given all all the wealth in this country 

92.65 96.20 B: yeah not even teens want to work for that amount 

95.89 96.67 A: (( uh-huh )) 

96.58 100.14 B: they're out to make ten dollars at least or more an hour 

100.34 102.49 A: oh yeah 

103.11 115.52 A: yeah it's it's interesting seeing in some places where they they have enacted living wage legislation like in i think what santa cruz california they have like a twelve dollar minimum wage or something for the city 

115.17 116.82 B: (( [noise] what area are you from )) 

116.44 118.80 A: i'm i'm from ah madison wisconsin 

118.39 122.18 B: oh wisconsin i'm from florida i'm speaking from florida 

120.44 123.78 A: oh okay interesting 

122.43 130.58 B: and everything is high priced here i don't know about wisconsin if you're at that peak of ah you know expense probably are [laughter] 

125.24 127.01 A: oh yeah 

129.97 134.01 A: (( uh-huh that's the case just about everywhere it's yeah )) 

132.25 139.16 B: right right unless you're in japan i think [laughter] i think we'd be doing good at that wage because they get paid very little you know 

134.78 136.13 A: (( [laughter] )) 

139.63 143.13 B: some of these foreign countries it might be okay for you know 

139.63 140.53 A: (( mm )) 

143.07 143.81 A: (( uh-huh )) 

143.16 148.16 B: because they would think it was a lot of money but for united states forget it you know 

148.06 149.37 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

148.76 151.32 B: obsolete obsolete [laughter] 

151.36 152.13 A: (( uh-huh )) 

152.35 156.60 B: no i wouldn't think of working for that price at all huh 

156.36 170.05 A: no i guess s- some k- some people just don't have a choice i know like around here there's a a meat packing plant right outside of town and ah the the corporation wants to dock wages like four dollars an hour and bring 'em down to eight eight eight an hour 

163.45 164.44 B: mhm 

169.76 171.31 B: oh my god 

170.21 178.05 A: and just just for no reason just because they can and so they're going on strike but they're bringing in other workers and it's just really scary they 

178.36 180.86 A: 'cause i mean it's just gonna devastate the community 

180.62 183.63 B: i believe on strike that they should do that 

183.05 184.32 A: oh yeah exactly 

184.31 187.33 B: alert the government alert everybody you know 

187.20 187.97 A: uh-huh 

187.91 197.18 B: because it should be unheard of in the united states you know in our country maybe foreign countries they love that because they would be ahead at five dollars you know 

192.26 193.57 A: (( oh i )) 

197.01 198.06 A: (( know )) 

197.68 200.21 B: they're making like a dollar a day or something 

199.20 201.07 A: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

200.79 202.38 B: like israel you know 

202.97 203.89 A: (( mm )) 

203.45 213.80 B: i know a man in israel he's a reporter and he only makes like god maybe fifty dollars a month or something like that you know he has four kids so to him that would be good wages you know 

213.53 215.51 A: mhm yeah 

214.42 221.83 B: but not in the united states no i couldn't support anybody couldn't help anybody i'd just have to get two three more jobs 

221.77 225.47 A: oh yeah s- so what what do you think a good minimum wage would be 

226.12 229.82 B: well to me you know the higher the better you know [laughter] 

229.02 231.33 A: uh-huh yeah [laughter] same here 

230.08 231.52 B: [laughter] 

231.94 242.34 B: to me i i would say as least ah ten dollars an hour as a minimum at least ten because i think you should be making at least fifteen or seventeen eighteen 

235.68 237.39 A: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

242.38 249.67 B: to twenty dollars an hour and minimum should be ten to give people something to live on you know 

249.38 250.09 A: uh-huh 

249.84 254.49 B: and so they wouldn't have to work so hard because many people are pulling two three 

254.61 263.59 B: jobs you know and that isn't right they should be able to relax and enjoy whoever you know their families or themselves or read a book or whatever [laughter] 

256.22 257.49 A: oh yeah 

262.93 267.25 A: oh exactly everyone [laughter] deserves a decent life 

266.81 268.00 B: yep 

267.58 280.99 A: yeah i it's it's interesting though i i'd i'd be i'd be curious to you know see what's going on in these in these cities where they have established these really high minimum wages it would be interesting to see if a lot of businesses left or or what happened 

280.93 283.42 B: me too i'd like to see that 

282.86 284.05 A: yeah 

283.43 289.79 B: florida's not doing too well with the businesses down here at this time k-mart has gone out 

289.71 291.06 A: (( mm )) 

290.46 292.40 B: has it gone out in your city 

291.98 296.23 A: i i think it has i think it it went bankrupt like nationwide 

295.79 298.13 B: that was minimum wage i think 

298.16 299.56 A: really wow 

298.69 306.51 B: or a little bit above i'm not sure how much k-mart workers made but that was close to minimum wage i think these stores were or 

306.74 307.46 A: uh-huh 

307.15 312.15 B: maybe they're nah maybe they're at seven or something but still it's outrageous yeah 

310.68 312.92 A: oh yeah 

312.30 316.34 B: companies are going down the tubes that are paying that amount 

316.43 317.21 A: uh-huh 

317.29 323.24 A: yeah well i'm i guess i'm not so sad to see the big you know k-mart stores go just because they're 

323.56 336.24 A: they have a history of being so cruel to their workers i mean especially you know w- wall mart i mean all the law suits spread against them for you know making people work without pay and such it's just scary 

335.80 342.77 B: yes i worked for close to minimum wage with a vertical company once and i was very unhappy to go to work 

340.39 341.53 A: (( mm )) 

342.91 343.66 A: uh-huh 

344.39 345.57 A: yeah 

344.42 352.17 B: i didn't have a lot to do there but it was isolated and they thought that was a fine amount to pay you know i was a receptionist 

347.31 349.49 A: oh yeah 

352.36 355.94 B: and um i didn't think it was a good amount to pay 

356.11 357.06 A: (( no )) 

356.20 358.66 B: and i didn't stay with it very long [laughter] 

358.08 359.30 A: really good for you 

359.52 361.15 B: i got out of there 

360.91 361.95 A: (( yeah it's )) 

361.99 366.40 B: but it is disgraceful in these ah two thousand and three you 

366.33 367.13 A: uh-huh 

367.68 368.51 A: (( [noise] )) 

367.76 369.09 B: (( know 'cause )) 

369.61 370.54 B: um 

369.64 371.48 A: yeah 

370.72 373.62 B: i don't know who chooses these wages 

373.32 375.50 A: well our our government [laughter] 

375.11 376.36 B: the president 

376.00 382.04 A: well the the first thing yeah congress has to pass pass the legislation and then the president signs it 

376.74 378.03 B: congress 

381.82 385.71 B: well i'd think they would have more sense you look at all the money they're making you know 

385.12 391.74 A: uh-huh of course if the if they did pass such legislation you know they wouldn't get any campaign contributions so 

386.01 387.25 B: and the poor 

391.53 393.56 B: yeah it's unfair the 

393.38 394.22 A: uh-huh 

394.28 403.43 B: whole country should picket it i think and then they'd have to do something 'cause the teenage- you can't even get a teen to cut your grass for that amount today you know 

396.50 399.48 A: oh yeah yeah 

402.71 404.14 A: (( [laughter] uh-huh )) 

404.85 409.33 B: i don't know any teen doesn't want to work for ten bucks my daughter she's ah 

408.80 410.81 A: really wow not 

409.48 413.01 B: twenty she's working at ten and she thinks that's too little 

413.15 414.75 A: uh-huh what does she do 

414.45 415.90 B: she's a book keeper 

416.52 420.37 B: and she wants to make fifteen she thinks that would be reasonable 

420.16 422.98 A: oh uh-huh does she is she she have a lot of training or 

422.45 423.64 B: yes uh-huh 

423.30 426.31 A: yeah well it seems like that if yeah if you 

426.27 438.38 B: she's going to college to be an accountant and then she will make further wages but as an example of ten dollars an hour she's not happy so can you imagine somebody making the minimum wage [laughter] 

437.82 438.73 A: (( uh-huh )) 

438.38 442.36 B: they're really unhappy about this so even then a girl twenty 

440.42 442.04 A: yeah 

442.42 449.08 B: even teenagers don't want to work for that amount they can't get anybody unless they're really desperate out there 

449.17 451.48 B: and they don't have any education 

452.07 457.42 B: maybe some foreign people but they're gonna have to have two or three other jobs to 

457.32 459.61 A: mhm 

457.57 460.03 B: you know support themselves on 

460.17 473.91 A: mm the problem where i am it seems like you know everyone's educated and so like i mean i'm i'm a college student as well and you know i worked at a grocery store last summer and you know there were there were people with masters degrees working at this grocery store just because 

467.61 468.59 B: right 

472.74 475.17 B: was that at minimum wage mm 

474.40 481.18 A: um it was ah we were making i was making eight fifty some of the other people were making ten probably 

480.75 486.55 B: i'm surprised at a grocery store that it was not that you know at least in your area 

484.45 491.62 A: uh-huh it was it was kind of an unusual place but yeah we we were pretty lucky to be making what we are we were i think 

491.21 502.60 B: florida has very low minimum wages at these places at these stores you know florida does not have a high pay and many people have left the state because of this there's 

494.57 495.60 A: (( mm )) 

502.71 506.69 B: not a lot of money to be made depends what field you're in 

506.69 508.76 A: oh yeah 

509.59 513.94 B: but your way i'm sure there's a lot of good um jobs out there 

509.86 510.51 A: (( yeah )) 

513.65 519.55 A: well [laughter] i don't know we'll see i guess it just depends on on what you what you're into 

519.34 527.47 B: yeah but that minimum wage i don't agree to at all and i wouldn't be happy with it at all i wouldn't even accept anything 

525.47 526.45 A: (( mm no )) 

528.08 530.75 B: you can't even get a baby sitter for that amount 

530.35 541.79 A: oh yeah well i guess the question is you know what do we do as a you know a general population you know if we feel that this is too low i mean it seems like we should be protesting and you know getting our legislators 

542.14 544.33 A: you know out there doing something 

544.54 548.19 B: yes email the white house and the congress and tell them 

547.38 548.24 A: (( [laughter] yeah mm )) 

548.20 554.85 B: how disgusted we are this is two thousand and three this is not the nineteen eighties you know 

550.08 551.21 A: yeah 

558.67 559.55 A: (( mhm )) 

561.25 568.96 B: and that's how i feel about the whole thing but um i don't see any changing it at all i really don't see any change 

568.40 573.32 A: nei- neither do i do you think do you think most of the people you know would would agree with you 

569.83 570.55 B: no 

573.04 574.35 B: yes uh-huh 

574.01 577.24 A: (( yeah so so do i i mean it yeah it j- )) 

575.87 583.81 B: well many people i know are not doing minimum wage but they're paying higher but they're still disturbed about their wages they don't think 

582.88 584.39 A: oh yeah uh-huh 

583.91 586.26 B: they're getting paid what they're worth 

586.39 592.76 B: but at this point i can't say i know anybody making minimum wage except i was in a job 

592.85 596.80 B: oh about two years ago i got stuck into a job that was ah 

596.93 599.90 B: that it was a little bit over that you know
