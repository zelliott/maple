109.59 110.53 A: okay 

114.71 116.33 A: oh of course

124.03 125.07 A: right 

124.44 130.93 B: to just get that little bit of money un- unfort- you know fortunately i have my own business so 

130.34 131.73 A: oh that's nice 

131.06 138.59 B: yeah i'm an an accountant so i just you know i i feel that the minimum wage should be much more actually 

133.11 134.62 A: right 

137.94 139.74 A: right right 

138.64 150.54 B: you know um although um i might be only a small voice that think then you know and the big businesses that can pay more will probably say no why should we pay more 

144.57 145.57 A: (( ah )) 

150.16 158.17 A: exactly yeah no i think it should be more too i mean that er nowadays you can't you can't do anything on that 

150.87 152.38 B: yeah 

157.67 159.13 B: that's right 

158.27 161.67 A: and um and in fact i'm i'm kind of a um 

162.24 170.10 A: stay at home mom right now but i would like to find something just kind of part time to do while my kids are in school 

163.93 165.28 B: okay 

167.31 168.60 B: mhm 

170.21 178.04 A: but because i didn't finish um college i kind of run into that problem of not having 

173.37 174.51 B: mhm 

178.05 191.87 A: a degree so i don't have very much choices [mn] you know and of course most things around here are more than minimum wage i mean you know they're like eight an hour is pretty much i guess seven and eight an hour is pretty much standard 

191.39 201.16 B: and and your s- in in your area in alabama yeah 'cause you know up here they still they really aren't still paying the minimum wage again the um [noise] 

193.28 194.56 A: yeah 

199.22 201.14 A: (( no no )) 

201.30 206.87 A: 'cause i work for a surgeon um in ohio and i think we were making thirteen 

202.97 204.21 B: okay 

206.34 207.61 B: mhm 

206.98 208.65 A: and that was part time 

208.20 211.42 B: well oh that's that's good yeah [mn] 

208.72 214.41 A: ye- yeah yeah that's not bad but um i can't find that down here 

211.48 213.26 B: no it's not 

214.19 215.00 B: (( mm )) 

214.46 223.37 A: part time [laughter] you know ah they pay a little bit better up there but i think of these poor people that are that have no education 

215.27 217.46 B: oh okay okay 

222.88 224.39 B: yes 

223.67 229.30 A: and no skills and trying to make a living off of five fifty or whatever i mean 

228.10 231.91 B: mhm it's it's not good and no it isn't 

229.32 236.85 A: that is nothing no and then they pull taxes out of that and well they're making four something an hour 

233.38 235.15 B: that's right that's 

236.39 247.94 B: fine it's the i think it's even less than that you know depending on how many or what they do as far as ah on that um w. four form you know if if it's 

238.91 240.14 A: yeah 

246.61 248.65 A: mhm right you're the 

248.38 257.16 B: mhm if if they put zero then the person who's only been making close to about three dollars and some cents you know 'cause it was from the taxes 

249.09 250.12 A: right 

254.47 261.29 A: yeah yeah 'cause that's what i had to put on mine whenever i worked because my husband has the deductions 

260.61 262.30 B: all right okay 

261.36 264.89 A: so um you know so they pull so much out so 

264.12 266.92 B: m- y- a whole lot of taxes out you know 

265.68 274.78 A: yeah and you think of all these poor single moms or single dads and and then you've got to find somebody to take care of your children that's kind of my dilemma my god 

268.16 269.77 B: i know 

273.82 275.92 B: ok- yeah babysitting 

274.83 281.32 A: i've got to pay somebody to keep my children and if i'm you know if i'm making eight dollars an hour 

276.21 278.83 B: that's right and and to 

281.85 285.07 A: and i'm paying them five [laughter] 

283.21 289.27 B: yeah you still coming on the yeah out of the end of the whole plan you know 

285.82 293.54 A: yeah [laughter] exactly so um of course i don't have answers i wish i had answers to it but 

289.40 291.03 B: yeah but i i 

292.80 307.45 B: i i know i i would love to be able to give 'em an answer but it's like a- like i said at least a ten dollar minimum to to maybe help you know maybe ten to fif- well i would even go to fifteen 

304.20 305.26 A: right 

307.59 310.17 A: oh that'd be wonderful yeah yeah 

307.66 311.15 B: fifteen dollars yeah because um 

310.62 314.83 A: of course your small businesses though probably can't do that you know 

313.42 321.38 B: no yes yes because ah we because i have a small business and i i believe that depending on your um 

315.23 316.27 A: you think 

322.18 332.52 B: what you can get ah to assist you on the financial area you know like maybe grants or loans and to help you run your business 

326.87 327.87 A: mhm 

332.39 333.45 A: right 

332.75 337.97 B: if we are able to get that and say people are able to get that for the business then 

338.27 346.92 B: you know fifteen dollars an hour is not bad 'cause l- look at well what what i ch- charge for because i'm a c._p._a. okay 

338.57 339.86 A: you can pay 'em 

346.41 348.08 A: right right 

347.29 357.45 B: what i would charge a person just if i have to defend on it in front of the internal revenue my fee is a hundred and twenty five dollars an hour 

354.62 355.64 A: mhm 

357.24 360.15 A: right so you can certainly pay that person 

357.58 359.12 B: so you know 

359.90 363.49 B: yeah you know the t- ten to fifteen dollars 

360.72 362.38 A: ten to fift- yeah 

363.28 364.28 A: mhm 

363.60 375.85 B: and and not feel really bad about two much well not bad behind what you're paying 'em but five dollars and fifty cents i feel very guilty you 

370.89 371.88 A: mhm 

373.49 374.53 A: right 

375.22 377.61 A: yeah yeah that's just nothing 

375.97 384.74 B: know knowing what i'm getting and then seeing that these people might have a family that they need to support also you know 

383.07 394.26 A: right well you know and it's still the same ten hours in a day [laughter] you know you think oh wow i make fifty dollars a day and you make five hundred seven hundred a day you know it's just 

386.72 388.87 B: that's right that's right 

390.64 392.21 B: mhm 

392.77 400.83 B: that's right and and they're just not equal and it it is i mean although i know everyone does [mn] they you know the degrees 

394.48 396.51 A: it's so unfair [laughter] 

400.66 409.46 B: people who do not have a degree but in some businesses which i'm trying to hopefully be able to do also is to give that tuition remission 

409.33 420.10 B: where they can go to school and ah go and get what they're trying to seek you know hopefully it's something in what we're doing together to better themselves 

411.61 412.93 A: right 

415.04 416.54 A: exactly 

418.46 419.56 A: mhm 

419.87 421.54 A: right right 

420.28 421.88 B: so um 

421.94 430.06 A: yeah that's what i'm in the process of doing now is trying to get student loans so i can go back to school so you know it's just um and i i 

425.11 426.37 B: okay 

429.06 434.72 B: are you going to how how are you going by your income for the student loan 

435.19 439.53 A: i don't know what i'm going to do i don't have an income [laughter] 

437.54 449.98 B: oh okay okay 'cause um it's sometimes it's better and then well your husband you're married so i was going to say isn't this good sometimes when women are um single 

439.91 440.77 A: so i 

444.09 445.11 A: right 

449.67 451.17 A: (( right they're )) 

449.98 454.05 B: you know 'cause they can can get the loans much easier 

453.48 455.33 A: (( mhm i know )) 

454.19 455.24 B: but being 

455.17 460.49 B: um married and with a husband that could possibly be making 

460.38 471.32 B: earning enough income it's difficult sometimes for them to even give you a loan i mean no n- well you can get the loan excuse me you get the get you can get the loan but you won't be able to get the grants 

464.73 466.04 A: (( i know )) 

471.34 473.14 A: right right 

472.26 478.32 B: and what you need would be the grants [laughter] you know so won't you won't have to pay them back 

473.23 474.95 A: and it's the same 

475.18 477.09 A: mhm you're right 

478.34 482.51 A: right so that i'm not they were not minimum wage thing yeah [laughter] 

478.69 479.83 B: but with the 

481.07 489.21 B: right and with that minimum wage though you know with [sigh] i don't know with the minimum wage i think that we 

489.92 492.97 B: it well it could increased it could be increased 

492.30 493.78 A: yeah yeah 

493.00 502.77 B: you know and um some of our big like i said the larger business even the small business can focus on that you know 'cause like i said the money's out there 

500.17 500.87 A: (( mm )) 

502.67 514.35 B: for businesses to get and it's just though applying for it and trying to increase what they have to increase other people's pockets 

514.22 515.98 A: right right 

514.80 517.10 B: you know so i ah 

516.36 520.02 A: 'cause you just i mean i just can't think of how anybody would make it 

520.03 531.69 B: (( it's impossible it's impossible you know unless you're a child um you know a little kid in school high school now yeah on five fifty an hour you can do for them but )) 

520.19 523.38 A: these days on minimum wage mm mm 

525.68 528.97 A: (( oh yeah exactly )) 

531.02 543.30 A: and that's not you know and when you're in high school all you need is to fill u p your gas tank and go eat pizza you know [laughter] so that five dollars an hour is you know is okay but not when you're trying to feed your family or 

534.20 535.69 B: that's it 

536.10 539.10 B: [laughter] that's it 

540.51 541.22 B: [laughter] 

542.44 553.71 B: no no no and then a lot of the kids that are in school have family like a lot of the young girls you know they're they're having babies earlier 

543.42 545.71 A: or anything like that but um 

550.60 551.88 A: mhm 

553.68 562.09 B: and only thing you know they're trying to help and assist their parents by working part time or whatever 

553.99 555.14 A: yeah 

562.12 574.55 B: to help sup- you know with the cost of that second child ah the first child that they had and yeah it's just no five fifty ah [mn] no [laughter] and 

565.94 566.99 A: right 

573.10 578.87 A: yeah i don't even i don't know if it's five fifteen or five fifty i'm not even sure what they say it is 

576.85 586.00 B: i think h- yeah i think she said five 'cause they it was at five fifteen at one time and i th- and that was the last 

586.07 587.50 B: increase 

587.22 588.19 A: okay 

587.57 593.67 B: and then um i think yeah they had just increased and i think it is now at five fifty 

588.59 590.26 A: they've just increased it 

593.39 595.28 A: right right 

594.18 599.89 B: but um like i said the only ones that i could see surviving off the five fifty are students
