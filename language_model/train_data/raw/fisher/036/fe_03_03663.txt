7.24 8.31 A: how you doin' 

9.32 11.45 B: please go ahead 

10.52 15.79 A: okay um yeah i guess the topic was supposed to be minimum wage is that 

15.16 16.07 B: right 

16.80 19.91 A: so it's at five fifteen an hour um 

19.95 24.76 A: i'm out in california i thought it was higher than that maybe they're talking about nationwide or something 

24.82 28.53 B: yeah i was surprised too because i thought that uh 

28.84 31.26 B: the minimum wage was uh 

31.31 35.07 B: higher than that already but uh 

33.09 34.46 A: yeah 

34.74 41.27 A: yeah last i checked it was over i don't know i mean i haven't made minimum wage but it's been over six dollars an hour 

41.79 43.52 B: yeah uh 

44.50 47.29 A: where're you at wh- i mean wh- where are you calling from 

46.71 48.68 B: uh dayton ohio 

48.23 49.45 A: oh okay 

49.09 50.40 B: and yourself 

50.32 52.37 A: i'm out in california 

51.75 53.04 B: oh okay 

52.68 58.98 A: yeah southern california so i know the it was higher even i think over six dollars 

59.11 60.10 A: so 

60.45 62.67 A: it's an old recording or 

63.16 64.33 A: uh 

64.37 67.53 A: it's current in some other part of the country 

66.91 68.29 B: or uh 

67.55 70.93 A: but i think that's really low for for minimum wage 

70.72 74.26 B: yeah or maybe they're just being uh 

74.34 79.54 B: you know devious and uh trying to put all us off the track here and uh 

75.92 77.01 A: [laughter] 

79.44 81.20 A: i guess it worked 

80.76 85.17 B: [laughter] yeah maybe to include that as part of a conversation 

84.91 89.86 A: yeah but uh what do you think it's pretty low huh 

85.92 87.15 B: (( that's how )) 

90.15 91.01 B: uh 

91.18 93.57 B: i i i think so uh 

93.98 96.84 B: relatively speaking you know uh 

97.04 98.06 B: (( um )) 

98.09 106.27 B: because of course i can remember you know when of course the minimum wage was was less than that and of course so was everything else 

105.95 107.18 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

106.50 107.62 B: um 

107.83 109.69 B: if it's uh 

109.72 113.95 B: m- you know the amount in and of itself isn't uh 

114.19 124.83 B: uh the the key thing it's it's of course the buying power and how much you can actually purchase with the money at at that point in time 

120.70 121.73 A: sure 

124.19 135.47 A: yeah like i know out here it wouldn't get me very far but other parts of the country maybe [laughter] or maybe you know if you have a job that's uh minimum wage plus 

135.64 137.37 A: overtime or plus 

137.51 140.13 A: commission it might work out 

141.57 143.59 B: right but uh 

142.13 154.56 A: you know there's there's jobs like that i had one minimum wage job a while back it was about fifty hours a week so that kinda made up for the the the wage 'cause it was a lot of hours 

154.79 157.23 A: you know plus overtime 

157.50 160.73 A: but i i doubt i could live on that nowadays 

161.65 164.37 B: yeah you sometimes wonder you know uh 

165.16 166.54 B: when uh 

167.34 170.71 B: when you have these ads you know that are essentially for 

170.77 173.19 B: just minimum wage you know 

172.97 174.04 A: mhm 

173.38 178.88 B: uh how it is that people are gonna manage when they go to respond to these things 

178.68 179.78 A: right 

179.11 180.14 B: uh 

180.82 183.47 B: that the amount that they're gonna get uh 

184.13 191.71 B: isn't going to pay everything that you need to to live uh i had a chance to uh 

191.92 194.76 B: to go to england last year and uh 

194.41 196.19 A: oh yeah 

195.52 198.78 B: and the minimum wage over there for example 

199.00 201.98 B: you know everything there is roughly about uh 

202.39 206.76 B: oh two thirds as much as i should say uh 

207.03 209.91 A: yeah 'cause they have the the pound it's about 

207.11 208.04 B: yeah 

208.53 213.91 B: perhaps as much as as well when you c- even at the conversion you know 

213.38 214.61 A: mhm 

214.07 221.00 B: uh it's uh 'bout three and a half pounds uh as as much as it would be here 

221.46 224.16 B: and uh i spoke with um 

224.53 228.14 B: [sigh] i had some time to spoke with some people and i 

228.24 238.21 B: asked them uh where they lived and most of the people that uh that were poor the ones that made minimum wage 

237.83 238.98 A: yeah 

238.32 246.28 B: uh they uh they they had to commute into the city they couldn't afford to live inside the city 

245.96 249.67 A: okay was it a it was the minimum wage for england 

249.15 251.73 B: yeah yes yeah 

249.75 250.68 A: they were getting 

251.94 254.26 B: um that uh 

254.89 265.55 B: you know london is is expensive enough and that when you look at uh the cost of housing and uh what it takes to uh 

265.98 268.21 B: to live in certain neighborhoods 

268.73 272.29 B: it it wasn't for them uh it's not a min- 

270.70 276.07 A: so probably you'd have to live outside the city to even get by getting paid minimum wage over there huh 

274.03 275.63 B: yeah exactly 

276.03 285.88 B: you know they've got a very decent national transportation system trains that of course is designed so that if you're on on a minimum wage job 

279.51 280.56 A: yeah 

285.92 288.53 B: you know it's passable it'll work 

288.60 289.99 B: but uh 

290.46 294.70 A: well i guess you could get into the city from taking the the tubes and the trains 

294.35 295.83 B: exactly 

295.22 296.83 A: yeah 

295.85 301.02 B: yeah take the trains and then ge- and within the city you've go- of course you've got the tubes 

301.30 303.14 B: uh where you can um 

303.42 305.46 B: move about and uh 

305.99 307.87 B: and of course you know if 

308.08 315.95 B: um there if if if you're gonna travel every day uh you you get a monthly pass or a ticket 

315.75 317.11 A: yeah 

316.17 320.69 B: or a combination which is sometimes the saving is as much as 

319.75 324.83 A: so you were just there on v- vacation vacation huh you were just there on vacation 

320.86 322.16 B: forty percent 

322.69 325.83 B: pardon me no it was it was for my job 

325.70 328.40 A: oh all right oh they paid you to be there 

328.14 329.95 B: yeah yeah 

329.33 331.23 A: (( oh all right )) 

330.11 333.50 B: uh th- that turned out to be nice yeah 

333.26 335.70 A: they probably paid you more than minimum wage huh 

335.61 344.09 B: oh yeah [laughter] i couldn't have afforded it if it was just minimum wage so 

336.38 337.62 A: [laughter] 

342.93 346.90 A: yeah they usually don't send you to to europe on minimum wage 

346.79 348.71 B: yeah so 

348.72 353.60 A: yeah i was i was there too a couple of years ago but it was more of a vacation 

354.25 361.43 A: i didn't get to to do the whole working thing there but i did have a friend uh that lived there and she had i think three jobs 

361.74 364.35 A: uh just to get by out in uh 

363.12 364.11 B: wow 

365.10 371.38 A: [lipsmack] it was kinda on the outskirts as well it was uh wat- waterloo i think it was it's just outside of london 

372.68 377.86 A: 'cause probably like very hard to live in the city getting paid you know 

380.17 382.87 A: with just one job with the low pay 

382.84 386.10 B: now was it close to the waterloo train station uh 

386.04 397.89 A: um yeah i i don't even think they had a car 'cause the like you said the transportation was so good they took the uh the tube all around into into the city and uh 

398.21 409.72 A: you're right they could buy like monthly passes weekly passes most of the people that i've seen on there w- were kinda like going to work almost like a little subway kinda like uh new york subway kinda thing 

400.40 402.35 B: mhm yeah 

409.00 409.95 B: right 

410.69 415.74 B: right i i had to do that i actually went there for the farnborough air show 

415.75 416.67 A: yeah 

415.79 417.25 B: and uh 

417.63 422.23 B: you know so in the morning you had to get up and uh 

422.30 426.14 B: uh get go down to the tube uh 

425.78 427.95 A: mhm 

426.28 431.90 B: take the tube down to the waterloo uh uh train station and then 

431.26 432.93 A: (( yeah )) 

432.01 434.88 B: take the train then to farnborough 

434.90 444.04 B: and then from farnborough uh at the farnborough train station get off and then catch a bus that took me then to the farnborough uh 

444.09 446.56 B: uh air station uh 

446.89 448.20 B: and uh 

448.55 452.54 B: that's where they they have the exhibits and i was there 

450.94 455.99 A: yeah but you had to pay for the the uh train and the bus right or did they 

455.13 460.40 B: w- well uh you know i i got that pass which uh 

460.53 465.41 B: you know even for a week it was a considerable savings 

465.12 470.48 A: oh yeah i think they have uh unlimited uh day day pass and week pass right 

465.92 466.69 B: but 

469.81 470.76 B: right 

470.52 475.35 A: yeah 'cause you need to get quite a few like transfers sometime 

471.16 472.79 B: and uh 

475.23 476.44 B: so 

475.48 477.15 A: to get there 

476.49 483.49 B: by by having that you know i was able to go back and forth at any time 

482.56 483.42 A: (( mm )) 

483.68 487.37 B: [cough] excuse me and uh but i still of course had the uh 

487.44 490.20 B: the bus to pay on top of that 

490.56 492.42 A: yeah 

491.11 492.17 B: (( uh )) 

492.55 495.08 B: [lipsmack] but uh it's uh 

495.98 503.55 B: you know i i don't think it's that much different uh in in some of the major cities uh in the united states where 

503.72 507.92 B: you know it's only the rich that can afford it to a to a degree 

508.12 520.56 A: mhm yeah i know uh i kinda live on the outskirts of l._a. here and a lot of people i know or myself that i live on the outskirts too when you live in the downtown area uh 

508.53 509.28 B: um 

520.60 528.85 A: you pretty much you have to have a really good job or you know shack up with some room mates or have a couple of jobs to get buy 

527.89 529.39 B: mhm 

529.11 536.71 A: uh with the like minimum wage job you're not gonna you're not gonna be able to to make it [laughter] at all like in the b- 

536.50 549.14 A: downtown l._a. hollywood area when i lived out there i had a roommate but some people have like you know three four roommates just to get by that's why i live on the outskirts here 

550.54 553.75 B: yeah you sometimes wonder how it was that people 

554.01 556.68 B: after like world war i._i. you know you 

556.77 569.85 B: you you hear and you see and you know you read about uh of course the times back then where you had of course only one wage earner in the family 

569.41 571.27 A: yeah 

569.92 574.23 B: and he wasn't earning that much more than a minimum wage 

574.25 575.08 A: (( uh-huh )) 

574.38 580.97 B: but he was able to e- essentially provide for everything that was needed 

581.83 585.04 B: and it was somehow enough to 

585.40 589.07 B: to take care of the entire family 

588.41 589.52 A: yeah 

589.24 593.26 B: and that was enough to provide for 

593.64 599.89 B: saving or paying for uh a home or making the down you know a down payment
