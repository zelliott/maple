455.52 456.41 B: okay 

456.42 457.54 A: um 

458.87 461.52 A: so what are what are your thoughts about it 

462.00 464.19 B: i think it's terrible 

464.71 476.16 B: i think eight dollars an hour what i'm making right now is terrible [laughter] 'cause i can't support i have two kids and i can't support 'em i have to get ah help like i pay 

468.57 469.76 A: yeah 

476.35 479.39 B: rent and i pay my insurance and i pay 

479.44 486.15 B: food and i pay day care and i am broke i mean i don't even have enough that day care's paying 

486.06 496.26 B: i got some assistance to pay like a percentage of my day care and i mean we're not doing good and i'm making more than minimum three dollars more than minimum wage 

495.85 497.16 A: yeah 

496.61 503.77 B: so a single mother on minimum wage or even ah two people that would be ten dollars an hour 

504.18 509.58 B: for two people to work and i can't make it on eight and it's ridiculous 

504.28 505.33 A: yeah 

509.84 512.58 B: it just keeps people on welfare 

513.04 514.62 B: (( that's what i think )) 

514.87 516.69 A: yeah now yeah i mean i 

516.91 519.47 A: i feel like it's too low myself 

519.18 521.62 B: (( yeah )) 

520.35 521.59 A: (( um [cough] )) 

522.96 531.74 A: i mean i i mean i know there are people in the new york area who work on minimum wage and i'm not really sure how they get by i mean i 

530.59 533.92 B: [noise] no doubt how much is rent there [noise] 

531.87 533.10 A: they probably 

533.77 543.05 A: rent here well i only really know manhattan it's cheaper if you go out to like brooklyn or queens but um 

543.07 544.63 A: in manhattan 

544.78 550.13 A: average rent is about a thousand dollars a month for a one bedroom apartment 

547.75 548.73 B: (( oh my god )) 

549.57 550.99 B: a one bedroom 

550.76 553.38 A: well actually well more like a studio 

553.39 555.35 B: oh my god 

553.56 554.26 A: you 

554.89 558.63 A: yeah it's it's the rent is just ridiculous 

557.55 562.67 B: [noise] see i i wouldn't know what to do if all those bills were passing through my hands you know 

563.07 565.17 A: (( [laughter] throw 'em in the trash )) 

564.52 565.93 B: (( yeah )) 

565.64 568.82 A: yeah it's yeah it's it's just crazy 

567.94 569.96 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

569.14 573.50 A: although i think that um i think san francisco charges even more 

574.13 575.76 B: more than that 

575.50 577.87 A: yeah so i think 

576.36 579.27 B: so a three bedroom would be what 

579.48 581.96 A: [lipsmack] three bedroom in manhattan 

581.16 582.18 B: yeah 

582.55 588.54 A: ah depending on the neighbourhood it'd probably be like thirty five hundred a month 

587.62 589.69 B: oh my god 

590.14 591.53 B: [laughter] 

590.78 592.25 A: (( yeah )) 

592.06 593.65 B: oh that's funny 

593.54 599.89 A: but i mean if you live out in the some of the other boroughs it'd be maybe like two thousand a month there or less 

594.18 595.05 B: (( [noise] ))
