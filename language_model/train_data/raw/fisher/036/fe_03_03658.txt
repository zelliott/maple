121.59 124.15 A: absolutely [laughter] 

123.30 124.65 B: so what do you do 

124.69 130.01 A: what do i do i um actually i'm a substitute teacher at the time 'cause i'm looking for employment 

129.47 133.80 B: oh well substitute teaching is cool but that's pretty close to minimum wage huh 

133.41 137.61 A: [laughter] yeah actually it's a little bit above it it's like a hundred dollars a day [laughter] 

137.01 138.33 B: oh okay 

137.94 138.87 A: not bad 

138.55 143.25 B: yeah actually that isn't bad in l._a. they pay a hundred and thirty 

140.13 141.06 A: no 

143.04 145.04 A: oh in los angeles 

144.47 145.84 B: yeah 

145.61 147.53 A: you see that that's good 

147.21 154.44 B: yeah that that you know but in los angeles i don't know what sch- your school district looks like but in los angeles you really earn it 

153.90 155.52 A: yeah oh really 

155.02 160.41 B: well you're dealing with more if it was just teaching it'd be cool but you gotta deal with all the social issues too 

157.23 157.94 A: (( yes )) 

160.05 161.13 A: yeah 

161.13 163.96 B: yeah like trying to stay alive and all that stuff 

163.41 165.44 A: really is it really that rough 

165.58 176.23 B: in many places yeah particularly if you try to be a good teacher in and you know i mean try to enforce the quiet rules and get people focused and studying and stuff 

167.23 168.55 A: really 

175.33 176.27 A: right 

176.52 178.05 B: yeah it can be bad 

176.70 179.06 A: it's difficult huh wow 

178.73 185.03 B: and the self reinforcing because of course all the substitute teachers then just sit there and read and it becomes a cycle 

184.45 188.84 A: yeah exactly [laughter] you don't see it's good babysitting [laughter] you know 

188.20 192.98 B: yeah exactly well good for you so what kinda oh never mind we're off topic 

190.06 191.35 A: (( basically what it is )) 

192.66 195.32 A: yeah no sorry [laughter] 

194.65 197.31 B: well you're not looking for a minimum wage job i know 

197.12 201.90 A: definitely not no i'm looking for something in um sports uh casting 

202.34 204.13 B: oh very cool 

203.47 208.19 A: yeah i guess so who knows you know so's everybody else i'm sure [laughter] 

205.54 206.97 B: very cool 

208.02 211.31 B: well isn't e._s._p._n. like in connecticut 

210.72 214.25 A: yeah that's definitely accurate but i don't know 

214.54 215.51 B: (( yeah )) 

214.62 218.75 A: i don't know you see it's it's a little far though from where i am 

217.62 220.37 B: so you're gonna have to go to an affiliate market 

220.03 222.74 A: yeah i'm gonna have to go somewhere 

222.68 225.51 B: like albuquerque for the albuquerque devils 

225.64 226.55 A: what 

226.46 229.81 B: and like going to albuquerque for the alva- albuquerque devils 

229.11 231.84 A: yeah something like that [laughter] 

230.74 241.38 B: oh that's interesting see i'm an extra and i worked with a lady that had been a sportscaster yeah and she wants she wants to be an actress so she's left sportscasting and gone into acting 

233.88 235.06 A: oh you are 

235.67 236.89 A: [noise] see 

240.67 248.26 A: see that's what i initially wanted but i'm afraid i 'cause i have never taken any like uh actual classes or courses so 

247.56 251.37 B: oh sure like keanu reeves has studied all his life come on 

251.11 252.33 A: yeah 

251.76 253.61 B: none of those people study 

252.72 254.95 A: because i have to move out to l._a. for it 

255.15 257.70 B: um actually if you wanted 

257.71 263.01 B: it's easier this may sound weird but it's easier to get into the screen actors union 

262.94 264.10 A: really in 

263.33 266.25 B: in new york than it is out here in l._a. 

264.26 265.28 A: really 

266.02 267.44 A: really 

266.81 272.75 B: yeah they're better with their extras as far as getting them cards and stuff you know the union cards 

272.11 272.96 A: yes 

272.82 284.53 B: and there's enough shows that are filmed in new york i would really recommend doing the extra gig in new york get your card and then come out to los angeles 'cause if you don't have your card 

284.61 285.55 A: right 

284.96 286.61 B: there's no point in coming out 

286.28 287.27 A: really 

287.04 288.27 B: yeah 

287.77 288.58 A: (( no )) 

288.83 291.92 B: oh you can do it here i mean i don't mean to be sound pessimistic 

290.95 293.89 A: no no no that no that's a good step 

292.45 295.74 B: (( it's much easier it's easier in new york )) 

295.25 303.18 A: absolutely thank you for telling me 'cause i just you know everyone's like oh you can't do it here if you wanna go on broadway you can or soap operas you know 

302.89 307.43 B: well that's another way to get your card though and there's a lot of good actors that come up that rank too 

307.08 309.19 A: yeah that's true 

309.57 312.38 B: so cool good for you for following your dreams 

311.22 313.31 A: [laughter] 

313.08 314.96 B: that is really cool 

314.40 318.45 A: oh yeah so cool that's why i'm substitute teaching [laughter] 

317.80 323.37 B: yeah i know well it takes a while to get a running head start at it there's just another word of advice i gotta give you 

320.66 322.33 A: yeah definitely 

322.98 323.81 A: sure 

323.76 326.28 B: don't take anything personally 

325.69 332.25 A: no definitely definit- see you know that's definitely one big thing that i have to get over too 

332.65 336.38 B: 'cause sometimes you know what it boils down to is the pictures inside their heads 

335.94 337.39 A: mhm 

336.77 341.36 B: and sometimes the voices inside no i'm just kidding [laughter] it's the pictures inside their heads 

340.53 343.00 A: no no it's it's they 

341.70 345.39 B: and it's literally all about that 

344.80 346.83 A: and it's all it's not about 

346.99 349.54 A: you know it's all about who you know not what you know 

349.23 356.08 B: well actually that's not true though i don't wanna make it sound bad you gotta be able to when you get your break you gotta be able to do something with it 

350.59 351.49 A: no 

355.53 356.58 A: right 

356.50 363.10 B: but um actually as far as what's up a lot of people with will tell you it's about contacts 

363.30 372.48 B: but it's basically just being able to look like you'd be fun to be around and then the rest of it is candy to the workers everybody's job's riding on performance 

367.59 368.50 A: right 

371.85 372.74 A: right 

372.43 381.62 B: and no matter how nice a person you are or how much they wanna help you if you make them look bad then they're not likely to get their next job and it just kinda escalates 

381.12 382.07 A: yeah 

382.22 385.22 B: so all you gotta do is look like you belong in the clubhouse 

384.94 386.51 A: right [laughter] 

385.45 387.29 B: and and you'll be fun 

386.87 388.33 A: okay [laughter] 

387.32 392.08 B: and then after that it's what you bring to the table as far as your talent is concerned 

390.01 390.93 A: right 

393.35 394.10 A: so 

394.13 395.24 A: (( all right )) 

396.21 398.41 A: (( [noise] my daughter you hear this )) 

398.18 401.09 B: wow [laughter] 

399.53 403.63 A: (( [laughter] i don't know why [laughter] she's screaming )) 

402.07 405.10 B: (( wow it's a cheerleader camp cool )) 

404.46 408.51 A: (( [laughter] cheerleader camp i [laughter] i was a cheerleader but )) 

407.38 411.84 B: [laughter] hanging on the camp is no fun 

409.08 416.67 A: [laughter] she thinks she thought she knew someone on the news she's screaming right across [laughter] the house like [laughter] someone killed her 

414.46 415.50 B: oh 

415.74 419.49 B: talking talking to a television set is always a good sign 

418.88 420.61 A: yes it's lovely [laughter] 

419.89 422.66 B: [laughter] 

421.94 424.15 A: we don't get out much yes [laughter] 

422.84 427.12 B: when the people with the white coats start coming just say hi nice to see you 

426.48 430.33 A: (( exactly and the straight jacket [laughter] )) 

429.30 435.79 B: [laughter] well that's cool so when you guys come out you'll actually know people that you can scream at the television 

431.24 431.97 A: so 

435.22 437.24 A: (( yes [laughter] absolutely )) 

435.89 436.91 B: [laughter] 

438.55 440.89 B: yeah what will you tell strangers 

440.67 443.69 A: (( okay [laughter] )) 

443.62 446.29 B: well very cool so are you studying at all or 

446.14 449.49 A: um no i need to start getting into a program 'cause 

449.52 453.25 A: i obviously i'm not gonna be able to to just 

453.51 455.88 A: go and wing it 

455.65 458.77 B: (( well yeah that's true that's very true )) 

455.96 461.19 A: 'cause you can't you know you need to have some background just so you're secure 

459.25 461.58 B: even if it's only for yourself 

462.06 462.92 A: (( you're what )) 

462.63 465.56 B: even if it's only for yourself that you know you can do it 

465.09 470.34 A: right see that's why i i wanna get into a class where i can so i can just 

470.86 472.42 A: [lipsmack] 'cause sometimes you know 

472.47 473.16 A: in 

473.27 478.89 A: you know i'm afraid to go for classes 'cause then i could get into one technique or something 

478.90 485.58 A: but then i i'm like if i don't do it then i'm gonna feel insecure and that's gonna show so it's not good 

484.98 493.63 B: yeah that isn't good you know the thing about classes though is here's the deal you just do it 'til you get it and then you add your own flavor to it anyways 

490.52 491.69 A: mhm 

493.15 494.40 A: (( yeah )) 

494.00 497.49 B: like picasso studied to be a completely representational painter 

497.07 498.20 A: right 

497.57 499.34 B: and then he totally changed 

498.77 499.63 A: right 

499.57 501.58 B: so you can do the same thing 

501.69 506.99 B: and the cool part about it is what the training helps you to do is you fall back on it in times of stress 

506.63 507.52 A: right 

507.34 509.26 B: and that's all it takes 

509.37 510.19 A: right 

509.66 517.75 B: basically screen acting is getting to your mark and um underplaying don't don't go for stage training 

517.52 518.43 A: no 

518.38 520.80 B: 'cause that totally shows up in camera fake 

520.94 522.03 A: yes 

521.88 522.96 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

522.53 527.41 A: definitely i wanna be like julian barberry the top she's slid in [laughter] she's good though 

527.17 530.01 B: [laughter] yeah is she from new jersey too 

527.85 529.22 A: [laughter] 

529.47 532.88 A: i don't know where the hell she's from no i think she's from canada actually 

530.81 532.25 B: she seems like it 

532.54 535.51 B: say it one more time oh from canada you're right 

533.37 534.71 A: canada mhm 

534.80 536.63 A: [laughter] 

535.93 541.68 B: you're right well she's one of our local newscasters so i i watched her grow up from weather person to personality 

537.61 539.41 A: yes yes yes 

541.96 543.54 A: what what is that 

542.56 546.53 B: i watched her grow up from weather person to personality it's interesting 

544.91 545.76 A: yes 

545.99 547.90 A: absolutely [laughter] 

547.58 551.36 B: well it sounds like you you just need to get out there and do something 

550.68 554.40 A: yes absolutely i just have to go out and do it [laughter] 

553.68 554.92 B: yeah 

554.63 558.19 A: i'm going for an interview with the david letterman show on monday so 

557.46 560.00 B: oh very cool 

559.14 562.12 A: yeah hopefully something'll pan out [laughter] 

561.74 563.55 B: very cool 

563.17 567.71 A: behind the scenes whatever i have to do you know [laughter] good contacts anyway 

565.36 567.25 B: oh yeah no kidding 

567.87 572.09 B: yep and you know a lot of time it's just knowing you can have fun too 

571.75 573.91 A: exactly so 

573.06 574.88 B: oh that'll be great 

574.17 577.24 A: yeah so i figure why not no harm 

576.85 579.14 B: just watch out you don't end up as a producer 

579.25 581.25 A: oh do- that's not good right 

580.63 586.52 B: no it's no- it's not bad it's just if you wanna act it's not what you wanna do it's it's dangerous if you go for backstage work 

583.65 585.26 A: no exactly 

586.19 588.14 A: i'll be miserable for the rest of my life 

587.71 591.00 B: well maybe not but you never end up getting the acts 

590.51 591.76 A: no i know 

591.53 599.89 B: like i made the mistake of going into business in legal affairs and when somebody a director i met offered me a role and my boss wouldn't let me go
