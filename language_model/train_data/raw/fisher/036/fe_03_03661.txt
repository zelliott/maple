0.52 2.08 B: brian ramona 

2.33 5.09 A: crouski st james 

5.41 6.33 A: (( brian )) 

6.43 11.02 B: yeah hi [laughter] i i'm doin' well how are you doing 

8.25 9.23 A: (( how ya doin' )) 

10.85 12.43 A: i'm doing well 

12.16 17.76 B: i i would say that [laughter] five fifteen an hour i know if i had to live on it it would be pretty tough 

17.98 20.10 A: (( yeah um where are you at )) 

20.25 22.26 B: uh outside of philadelphia 

20.29 21.12 A: (( where are you living )) 

22.13 28.59 A: yeah i i live in l._a. and [laughter] if i was to go on five fifteen an hour it just wouldn't cut it at all 

28.02 36.82 B: yeah i know that i h- having lived in california before i know that uh the cost of living there is even more severe than it is here so 

36.88 45.65 B: uh having looked at actually at one at one point relocating uh i originally grew up in northern california so i'm [laughter] pretty aware of how expensive it is to live out there 

44.69 45.56 A: (( yeah )) 

45.70 59.44 B: so uh i mean do you know people that are making that kinda money now 'cause i i frankly don't i don't either uh i've encountered them but i don't know them and i wouldn't even know where how to ask them how they how they do it especially when they have kids and a family 

49.82 51.46 A: (( i don't i don't )) 

59.29 61.89 A: yeah yeah and i'm i'm finding i just um 

61.98 72.04 A: recently moved so i was looking for an apartment and found that the rent was outrageous compared to what i was making i mean just uh the bare minimum rent was nuts 

72.26 79.97 B: oh a- and that's yeah i know when i investigated apartments it was like twelve hundred a month for a one or two bedroom apartment it was incredible a- 

78.76 82.32 A: yeah i don't know how some of them making five fifteen 

82.50 85.33 A: could possibly afford that 

84.44 97.65 B: and even with two fa- you know two people working in the family it's uh i think five fifteen an hour is not fair but you know at the same time even though five fifteen an hour is is certainly not something you could live on 

97.61 108.36 B: you also can't expect somebody to make at mcdonald's you can't give them fifty thousand a year to flip a burger too so it's kind of like a a double edged sword i mean i 

107.25 108.49 A: yeah catch twenty two 

108.57 116.02 B: mean to me if it were i- it's almost a motivator to not continue to make that kinda money 

115.89 120.11 A: right to find something else that's uh a little bit more accommodating 

116.48 117.53 B: and 

119.71 122.43 B: exactly exactly 

121.45 123.70 A: [noise] yeah definitely i don't know um 

124.73 130.38 A: i i could live with being in a high school and and i think minimum wage was like three fifty or something 

130.56 134.50 A: and that to me it's just i can't believe it it's not 

134.18 149.17 B: oh yeah i think yeah i think i'm trying to think when i when i g- when i got outta school [laughter] long time ago but i know that that that the minimum wage issue is one that's been floating around for so long that it's it's almost uh e- e- everybody has always looked for more 

148.79 162.79 A: [noise] well it's funny to me is that a lot of the employers a lot of the businesses are getting a- i mean they don't uh they're not worried about it you know i mean 'cause they know people need work so they're gonna pay the people as little as possible and know that they're gonna accept it 

162.10 175.36 B: even even paying minimum wage and i don't know how welfare compares but i i know that there are people on welfare who i can't imagine could be making more than five fifteen an hour if you compared working a forty hour week 

175.12 184.10 B: but there are some people who who should probably even just even consider minimum wage just to get back working again to make themselves viable but guess 

181.47 182.46 A: right 

183.31 186.23 A: i i agree with that i agree with that 

185.09 192.15 B: but they won't they won't consider a minimum minimum wage job because it may be below what they're what they believe that they're worth or 

192.21 196.48 A: right and everyone's got their own their own self worth value 

192.23 193.19 B: or 

197.01 210.67 B: yeah i mean i know if it were me there's no way i would want to do it myself i mean there is no question i would i i i w- w- i would struggle at five fifteen an hour and i work party salary and commission so i make a very low 

210.93 218.47 B: i guess if you look at it on a per hour basis i probably don't make a ton of money per hour in salary but because i 

218.59 224.65 B: hopefully augmenting that in in what i make in commissions it makes it more palatable but 

224.28 226.33 A: (( yeah right right but but )) 

225.16 231.96 B: uh i i know that [laughter] i i i pity somebody have to to and that's really their only option 

232.11 233.14 B: uh 

232.97 242.42 A: i mean i i would do it as a stepping stone you know if i got knocked down to the very bottom or something something happened and i knew that i had to get back up and that was the only way i could survive right now you know 

241.60 242.97 B: yeah 

242.50 243.91 A: you have to 

243.85 246.75 B: y- you gotta do what you gotta do exactly and 

246.13 248.76 A: i'm not above it you know what i mean but uh i- i- i- it's 

248.79 250.94 A: kinda sad that it 

251.90 256.05 A: nobody's doing anything to increase it for the people who have no other choice 

255.98 268.68 B: that's true i was i know at one point about ten twelve years ago i was actually i answered ads for jobs that i didn't even know you know there weren't even really jobs there if you 

268.55 279.03 B: wanted to go out and sell perfume door to door and stuff like that and they you know they didn't even pay minimum wage i mean they they were more or less scam positions they weren't real 

271.37 273.80 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

279.09 279.92 A: right 

279.46 292.49 B: but they were you know y- y- again it was like the situation like you say doing what you have to do just to get just to survive and make enough to to pay your bills and you know 'cause unemployment is no picnic either 

288.85 289.96 A: yep 

292.45 293.61 A: right 

292.58 304.86 B: [laughter] having been on unemployment before uh and i i don't know if the rules are different state to state [noise] but i know in in in pennsylvania and new jersey where i and and massachusetts where i've lived and and have pin- 

304.65 307.78 B: and collected unemployment in all those fine states um 

306.73 308.88 A: [laughter] 

308.00 319.96 B: uh it's [noise] it's not i- i- you can't survive on it for very long and [noise] i i managed to do it somehow i i don't know how sometimes 

315.27 315.99 A: right 

320.11 325.25 B: uh but i i think compared to minimum wage 

325.65 337.17 B: the unemployment compensation was was actually probably slightly more so i think right at least right now i know that there are people on unemployment that got extensions after nine eleven 

335.30 336.46 A: (( yeah so what's )) 

338.37 351.07 A: that's i don't know that's news to me as well we're spending uh his worth and now unemployment is getting more than minimum wage too sit at home and you know i'm not saying that you sat at home but a lot of people do 

350.80 351.94 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

351.94 359.63 A: collect unemployment so they're they're sitting at home making more than the person who's working at mcdonald's and working forty hours a week and busting their butt 

358.99 372.64 B: exactly and a- and there's not really that much incentive for them to go out and get work because they feel like in a lot of cases i know a lot of people have said why should i why should i run out and get a job because the only job i can get right now 

372.49 377.48 B: is a minimum wage job i'll end up having to take a pay cut so [laughter] i 

376.71 378.16 A: exactly 

377.58 379.50 B: i can't imagine 

379.95 394.52 B: i i know if if if they were to raise the minimum wage i know how they should raise it they should raise it by cutting the salaries of people that work in washington but [laughter] we all know that that's never gonna happen 

391.74 393.52 A: [laughter] 

393.94 394.76 A: right 

394.55 402.15 B: because you know they just keep voting themselves pay increases while people are are barely able to survive in their in 

401.53 404.93 A: whether you work at mcdonald's or whether you run the government 

405.01 407.99 A: everyone should make exactly the same amount of money 

407.96 410.95 B: [noise] oh it's it's im- it yeah uh it's it 

408.74 409.36 A: (( [laughter] )) 

411.01 417.47 B: it it's so funny well is it i could say it's funny i don't think it's funny if i if i were in the situation 

416.10 418.95 A: [laughter] 

417.68 421.24 B: but the uh what people have to go through 

421.85 429.22 B: an- just just to even get ki- you know just to just to make make things happen in their lives it's 

429.39 434.82 B: and with the economy the way it is and people getting laid off all over an- and i talk to people in every 

434.84 438.56 B: in every type of industry and they all 

438.68 445.08 B: every industry's been hit by lay offs and people have no hope of getting jobs in their chosen field 

445.21 457.49 B: in a lot of cases people at middle management levels have no where to turn whatsoever so uh you know they they're living in a two hundred thousand dollar house they can't go make five fifteen an hour 

451.30 452.89 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

457.36 461.09 A: [noise] right bec- 'cause they've set it up like that 

459.66 464.44 B: mhm they've they've gotten themselves to a certain point 

464.09 467.23 A: (( right i went to pay my taxes today ex- )) 

464.78 471.38 B: where that's all that's all they can go th- they could never take a job like that because they would lose they would lose 

471.21 472.41 A: right you'd have to 

472.65 474.76 A: start giving them everything and start over 

475.29 486.02 B: and then you know i i don't even know if you know is the five fifteen an hour job enough in- incentive to keep people from from criminal activity maybe in some cases maybe not 

485.46 490.65 A: well i don't think it is i mean uh it it's easier to go and uh 

490.80 492.71 A: steal a parking meter [laughter] 

492.57 493.69 B: (( yeah )) 

493.13 497.55 A: and and do that in five minutes and make more than five fifteen an hour 

497.43 501.35 B: yeah walking down the street knock- you know mugging somebody who 

501.03 502.14 A: yeah 

501.43 507.12 B: some poor unsuspecting soul might have two hundred dollars on him it's probably more than they make in a week 

507.48 516.18 B: you know working uh delivering pizzas for dominos and a- and you know m- may the minimum wage being low contributes to a higher crime rate i don't know 

510.77 511.73 A: right 

516.05 518.39 A: i also think that's a very good uh 

518.53 521.67 A: (( i i wonder if there's a study or something on that because it uh )) 

522.12 524.35 A: if they they hire if they raise 

525.22 528.36 B: heaven knows the economists should really be looking at that 

528.07 529.50 A: right 

528.69 530.43 B: it's an issue that 

530.47 541.07 B: with the economy a- and how they're going to rebuild it and they talk about getting people back to work well you gotta make 'em you gotta give an inc- uh them the incentive to want to make what they're offering and 

540.41 541.64 A: exactly 

541.39 548.38 B: i know that o- our company we hired some telemarketers and they were [laughter] not paying them very much and they had trouble finding them so 

547.49 550.84 A: well i went and just i just did my taxes a- and um 

551.16 560.50 A: i was talking to the preparer and he was telling me how this year or the last coupla years actually how so many people have had so many different w. twos 

560.57 563.34 A: and nobody has been on a solid job 

563.19 564.47 B: (( oh man )) 

563.56 564.87 A: for more than a year 

564.78 566.11 B: oh man 

565.97 570.95 A: yeah he used like it's the last coupla years he it's increased so much 

570.96 573.25 A: and he's like if it's just unbelievable 

573.14 584.39 B: that's kinda what my w. twos look [laughter] like the last couple of years actually i've had a different main i've had a different main job each year for the last let me see if it this is the forth year now 

573.34 574.02 A: (( to )) 

576.97 578.95 A: him but mine as well 

584.73 587.09 B: i've had a different main employer 

587.33 590.35 B: which is crazy but you know 

589.58 592.69 A: i worked in uh television production so 

591.90 593.58 B: oh okay so [laughter]
