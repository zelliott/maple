50.84 60.12 B: okay i i agree with you that the minimum wage of uh a- anywhere around five dollars whatever it is is just ridiculous people can't survive on that kinda money today 

59.20 60.52 A: i know mhm 

60.38 68.22 B: they can't they can't uh you know you know personally uh i've always said to other people i think that what they should do the government should do is uh 

68.24 76.41 B: anything below uh five fifty to five seventy five dollar five seventy five an hour should be tax free 

76.03 77.00 A: yep 

76.53 79.27 B: so that uh people can uh 

78.54 80.10 A: actually live yep 

79.68 87.35 B: actually live on that money you know they take that money and they tax that and that's ridiculous it's a wonder people [sigh] have got to go out and work a 

83.66 84.38 A: no 

86.24 87.52 A: wonder people 

88.12 92.87 A: live in a homeless shelter and then they're always saying why don't you go out and get a job and when they do they 

92.85 93.78 B: mhm 

93.06 95.01 A: don't get a job worth anything 

94.71 98.62 B: they get a job and you can't even get ahead you can't pay the rent because of that low money 

97.99 99.44 A: (( i know [laughter] )) 

99.09 106.40 B: uh i i think it's ridiculous th- they should uh have it tax free to the point where people can uh 

105.73 107.25 A: hold on one second okay 

106.84 107.68 B: sure 

115.73 116.54 A: [noise]

123.40 130.53 B: yeah all right yeah um uh can i ask h- how is the uh employment situation in your part of the country 

130.51 133.74 A: uh i mean it's pretty good but not spectacular 

133.49 137.48 B: yeah do you think you got a lot of people on minimum wage 

137.36 139.33 A: yeah my um [lipsmack] 

139.35 141.40 A: my daughter candace dooley 

141.18 142.32 B: mhm 

141.67 149.77 A: she's a minimum wage job and she has to have three job two jobs so she has two jobs right now that's minimum wage so 

149.34 150.33 B: yeah th- 

149.82 151.15 A: she's making 

152.25 155.35 A: you know about ten dollars every hour 

155.46 156.37 B: (( oh )) 

156.68 160.55 A: (( sh- she's not even making that i think she's making like six fifty an hour )) 

156.78 158.12 B: (( really )) 

160.92 162.34 A: in each job 

161.92 163.54 B: s- six fifty 

163.11 164.20 A: yeah 

163.56 164.71 B: yeah 

164.82 173.62 B: [sigh] uh let's and they wonder why they have high levels of crime and and and uh trouble and i i think personally a 

170.77 171.41 A: (( they )) 

172.76 173.85 A: don't pay 

173.68 179.71 B: lot of that stems from people not being able to to buy the things they need let alone things they want 

179.45 180.18 A: (( no )) 

179.88 187.90 B: uh it j- if they br- brought it up to oh oh six fifty let's say six fifty to start 

188.15 191.54 B: i think that would uh and and make it tax free 

191.61 195.30 A: i think anything below eight dollars should be tax free 

195.21 203.88 B: eight dollars really yeah well what's your experience have you held [cough] a lot of jobs in th- that were minimum wage in in your you have 

196.11 197.05 A: yeah 

202.25 203.47 A: yes 

203.49 204.79 A: i one 

204.74 208.38 B: okay and w- did you have hard times while you were working at the 

207.49 209.87 A: yes yes very hard times 

209.42 217.12 B: w- with your finances and things and trying to pay the bills and were you tempted to get another job to in in addition to the one you had 

210.91 212.01 A: mhm 

216.95 218.06 A: (( um )) 

218.22 219.16 A: sorta 

218.96 227.60 B: mhm w- what you were earning on that job w- were were your basic needs being met or or were a lot of things that you needed uh 

226.69 229.24 A: no a lot of things i needed i can't get 

228.78 237.96 B: you couldn't get from that job from that wage yeah was it a forty hours a a a job or is it more than forty or less than forty 

230.84 231.58 A: yes 

237.36 240.17 A: um i think it was forty or less 

239.94 241.36 B: mhm 

241.94 252.11 B: yeah a a lot of things too is that uh when people uh th- those lower wage jobs they um uh people don't stay in them that long and they have high turnover 

252.11 252.74 A: (( mm )) 

252.38 265.05 B: th- th- th- they y- y- a new person comes in off the street and you have to train them all over again and it takes time uh if there's a procedure and th- this is lost to the company because the person isn't isn't skilled 

257.55 258.65 A: (( mhm yep )) 

265.39 272.27 B: and uh it just that uh if the person uh the company paid a bit more the people might stay longer 

266.02 266.73 A: (( ouch )) 

272.15 279.22 A: yeah 'cause you're right basically if they can't pay you enough then you're wasting your time because nobody's gonna stay at a job that's not that good 

272.58 273.88 B: at that 

278.86 291.54 B: exactly so th- th- i think personally that there should be a cut off time or a a a a starting wage to where uh the beginning uh rate would be uh six fifty to start 

291.69 300.29 B: and and then go from go up from there for five dollars this is the year two thousand and three and that's ridiculous you know uh uh uh 

296.69 297.64 A: (( yeah )) 

300.31 304.79 B: high school kids are making eight or nine dollars an hour at at wendy's 

304.65 305.90 A: yep 

305.27 314.97 B: and if you have a child or if you have uh uh rent or apartment or car payment uh five dollars an hour is is it it's a joke it's not even worth considering 

314.69 320.64 A: yes well my thirteen year old's always momma momma momma 

320.91 322.71 B: you have a thirteen year old 

322.16 324.34 A: a thirteen year old and a twenty year old 

323.95 325.73 B: oh my goodness okay 

325.81 329.95 B: so o- obviously y- you're feeling the pinch about uh not earning enough 

329.83 331.30 A: well yeah 

330.81 337.21 B: i- i- if you had a a minimum wage job at this time with those two children would you be able to make it 

337.09 338.25 A: (( no [laughter] )) 

338.04 339.84 B: yeah 

340.34 351.22 B: yeah same here it's like it's like having a a house payment that [laughter] and you know being able to you you can't do it it just uh e- even car insurance car insurance now is mandatory 

347.47 348.31 A: mhm 

351.08 360.61 B: with a car uh if it's mandatory by law how how uh i think it's probably mandatory there in in uh arkansas or alabama alabama 

360.05 361.13 A: alabama 

361.05 368.20 B: uh how do they expect people to do this i- if you're not you know i- i- if they're making these kind of requirements of people in general 

368.25 371.65 B: they've got to also make it easier for them to do it 

371.75 374.00 B: okay raise that wage 

374.05 380.55 B: make that wage tax free up to a certain point in my opinion 

380.43 382.11 A: it is ridiculous 

381.79 383.65 B: yeah yeah yeah but 

382.98 385.29 A: (( how old are you you sound sorta young )) 

385.10 391.08 B: really you're kidding me uh well i i i'm old a a youthful forty five 

385.65 386.45 A: yeah 

386.88 388.37 A: no why 

390.50 391.35 A: oh 

391.21 392.37 B: how 'bout you 

392.40 393.39 A: fifty 

393.27 396.30 B: really you you you sound good yourself thank you 

393.92 394.71 A: (( yeah )) 

396.67 406.11 B: yeah but uh i- i- i think personally another thing you might cut out is a lot of crime in the country it might come out a lot cut out a lot problems 

402.50 403.54 A: mhm 

404.51 415.31 A: yes yes because people are stealing because they don't have jobs that're paying 'em paying them enough so therefore they steal what they need and what they want because they don't have enough money 

415.16 420.02 B: exactly and the the job market is bad and those jobs that they do have the employer 

419.90 423.40 B: realizes they can get away with cheap labor and cheap wages 

423.22 432.71 B: because there's a hundred other people out there looking for that position but there should be a law that provides for that person to get that job to start at at a wage which is decent 

432.53 437.75 B: to i- i- in relation to the times in relation to the the ec- the economy 

437.56 447.90 B: uh like six fifty an hour would be a good starting wage i don't care wh- if it's a high school kid outta school or or what have you so five dollars an hour should be phased out 

448.22 449.07 A: (( yep )) 

448.70 452.07 B: that's just as bad as as as asking for three dollars an hour 

452.70 454.76 B: it it it just does it doesn't 

453.82 463.31 A: well i mean is someone if i went into a job and tol- somebody told me i was getting paid three dollars an hour i would turn around and i would say goodbye and i would walk outta the door 

463.37 474.88 B: well that's probably up to five dollars an hour also and you can't do anything with it look at the cost of gasoline if you have a car even if you don't if you ride the bus what's a bus cost more or less today 

470.45 471.34 A: (( yeah )) 

474.89 475.72 A: more 

475.48 476.47 B: more 

476.57 485.51 B: sure everything costs more and and and all these uh higher prices are all being passed on to grocery store the if you have to get a prescription for something 

485.27 496.52 B: uh higher prices are there e- e- in order for you to do it in order to make it without considering even or thinking of crime or you know the law end of the scale for us people earning money 

496.51 506.52 B: th- th- th- that would be a way to to cut it out or wait it t- to stop or cut back on the crime rate if they will um be- because other than that 

502.74 503.96 A: mhm 

506.32 512.81 B: uh you're gonna h- you know most of the crime is is caught b- or done by people of low wage 

512.67 513.80 A: yes 

513.15 515.56 B: n- not by your upper scale people 

515.86 527.02 B: and i i think the company the country should come in with a federally mandated law to start the minimum wage at um at uh six six fifty an hour as soon as possible 

526.22 527.78 A: at least 

527.20 528.05 B: yeah 

528.54 531.31 B: [lipsmack] six fif- not six dollars six fifty an hour 

531.46 533.75 B: i thought it was around there right now 

533.60 536.60 A: yeah no it's it's five five fifty 

534.29 535.55 B: i'm dead serious 

536.18 539.89 B: it's at five fifty i had no idea [lipsmack] 

537.51 538.36 A: yes 

539.70 544.28 A: no no i think that like my little girl just told my little thirteen year old told me a couple a days ago 

545.54 548.73 A: it's um five thirty five 

548.42 552.03 B: oh a- and you know that they tax that too 

549.35 550.78 A: minimum wage 

551.89 553.20 A: mhm 

552.79 554.69 B: that's before taxes 

555.23 557.53 B: i mean it's just it's a shame 

557.72 560.02 B: what if some people are w- working for 

560.80 572.85 B: and and they wonder again like they wonder uh why why uh uh you know the crime situation is bad people do things th- all right th- th- th- that will be one serious way to eliminate um [lipsmack] 

573.18 577.56 B: a lot of a lot of trouble a lot of problems on the lower end of the scale 

576.56 577.74 A: yes 

577.43 590.83 B: and then you got young people they can earn money for uh clothing or school or what have you um i- if a business can't afford to pay that kinda thing well maybe they shouldn't be in business 

590.67 592.94 A: yes that's that's very true 

591.46 599.89 B: um but but th- th- uh as far as as as um using people um for low a low wage like that that's that's that's
