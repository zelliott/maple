203.52 204.09 A: (( [noise] )) 

204.82 205.53 A: (( mm )) 

205.85 208.19 A: well think uh 

208.49 211.81 A: i think in new york uh three bedroom 

212.23 217.30 A: three bedroom apartment would be i don't know uh probably upwards of 

217.58 220.21 A: of two thousand dollars so 

219.54 220.40 B: (( wow )) 

220.63 222.01 A: (( obviously it wouldn't be )) 

222.30 223.86 A: enough for uh 

224.18 228.16 A: for that situation i know in some city uh 

228.72 230.33 A: there's um 

230.46 235.02 A: in some cities uh workers that work for the government are 

235.92 239.65 A: uh required to be paid um 

239.73 246.27 A: a different minimum wage uh like in san francisco it's something like fifteen dollars an hour 

246.61 253.12 B: (( fifteen oh now that's good okay well that meets uh the standard of living there is higher )) 

252.47 253.07 A: [noise] 

253.59 256.68 A: yeah 'cause uh while the cost of living is higher 

256.92 257.87 A: (( um )) 

258.53 264.59 A: but then again if you're living uh in a different part of the united s- a three bedroom house 

264.62 266.25 A: might cost uh 

267.92 268.74 A: (( uh )) 

270.70 273.91 A: (( eight hundred and that could be more reasonable )) 

272.24 274.95 B: yeah i i i we have 

274.97 281.20 B: here but the a three bedroom house will cost about seven fifty eight hundred 

281.45 283.54 A: (( seven fifty mhm )) 

282.84 285.23 B: (( seven seven hundred and fifty )) 

284.78 285.94 A: mhm 

285.29 287.49 B: eight hundred dollars uh 

288.06 294.43 B: in such suburbs it's difficult for you to get jobs anyhow because uh 

294.58 297.28 B: (( uh they they're suburbs with uh )) 

299.82 303.24 B: small populations the population of the suburb is low 

303.20 311.84 A: mhm and probably if you lived in the suburbs uh you'd have to rent a car or you'd [noise] buy a car as well 

311.14 317.85 B: (( yes i i think you must get a car because um most suburb here do not have good transportation system )) 

317.76 319.89 A: mhm yeah that's 

320.06 321.37 A: that's definitely true 

322.01 323.84 A: how much do you think uh 

324.12 330.22 A: that a single single bedroom apartment in would go for over there 

329.62 331.59 B: (( okay where where i )) 

332.22 337.34 B: (( live a single bedroom apartment will cost about seven )) 

337.41 340.00 B: (( hundred to eight hundred hundred )) 

339.63 340.59 A: mhm 

340.62 341.65 A: oh really 

341.85 343.90 B: in the suburb i i stay 

343.91 345.21 A: mhm 

344.72 350.62 B: in chicago the um uh west chicago area is called austin austin area of chicago 

350.77 357.85 B: uh a single bedroom house might cost about four fifty 

357.50 359.29 A: mhm 

358.59 360.01 B: (( or five hundred )) 

361.75 365.68 B: (( but even at that it means you are asking that person )) 

365.91 370.74 B: to live on maybe two hundred dollars a month because you will have paid 

370.90 372.72 B: (( uh five hundred you )) 

372.78 375.22 B: will now pay utilities 

375.76 376.68 B: and 

376.61 381.50 A: mhm then they wouldn't pay for for food [noise] telephone 

379.32 384.00 B: (( um the i mean yes there it is )) 

384.50 387.45 B: so it's a little bit difficult very difficult 

384.67 385.60 A: mhm 

387.51 389.09 A: mhm 

388.36 392.93 B: but how much do you think we should be go- uh correct uh minimum wage 

393.18 395.66 A: well once that uh 

395.86 397.91 A: person's well 

398.23 401.22 A: there are there are a lot of people who 

402.65 404.38 A: whose reason 

404.95 406.84 A: (( again are not )) 

407.35 408.91 A: though even though it's 

410.16 411.56 A: (( uh bu- )) 

412.15 412.83 A: (( [noise] )) 

414.65 416.50 A: (( um [noise] )) 

415.83 417.97 B: (( are are are you are you using a cell phone )) 

419.61 421.20 B: (( are you speaking on your cell phone )) 

422.19 423.75 A: excuse me [lipsmack] 

423.36 426.63 B: (( are you sp- speaking with a cell phone are you using a cell phone )) 

429.37 430.15 A: hello 

429.76 430.68 B: (( hello )) 

431.34 432.02 A: (( [noise] )) 

432.97 433.91 B: (( hello )) 

433.94 434.74 A: hello 

434.87 436.99 B: (( yeah okay i'm hearing you now )) 

437.11 437.88 A: okay 

438.84 440.25 A: yeah so 

440.29 442.71 A: what are the alternatives to uh 

443.56 456.27 A: raising the minimum wage might be uh might be increasing taxes for um for for people that earn more so that so that the government can provide services for uh 

457.03 464.94 A: for people who actually are say working at minimum wage because those are the people that need the most assistance from the government 

464.10 467.85 B: yeah you know i i i lived a bit in england and 

468.04 474.74 B: uh in england the transport syst- system for example was uh much better than here 

475.00 475.71 B: uh 

475.01 477.18 A: the transportation system 

476.49 477.63 B: yes 

477.51 478.80 A: mhm 

477.71 482.10 B: (( and um you could get a a one year ticket )) 

482.30 485.98 B: for the subway and the and the buses 

484.05 484.61 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

486.11 487.90 B: and it is very cheap for you 

488.79 492.80 B: (( but here i mean if well here where where i )) 

493.30 497.06 B: live it's uh wherever you go to you pay a dollar fifty 

497.01 497.98 A: mhm 

497.23 499.05 B: uh uh 

498.42 503.14 A: yeah yeah that's a s- here in uh as in new york it's a dollar fifty 

503.01 510.35 B: (( yeah so it's uh it's not a good i mean if they can improve this transportation system and um )) 

510.49 511.81 B: (( just like you said they )) 

511.93 514.58 B: increase taxes for the rich 

515.11 516.68 A: mhm 

515.15 517.32 B: and reduce taxes for the poor 

517.69 518.64 A: mhm 

518.53 521.66 B: they it might uh it might it might improve things 

521.41 528.65 A: mhm because because if you increase the minimum wage then that puts that puts the burden on 

528.67 530.01 A: (( you know uh )) 

530.86 532.78 A: on smaller businesses 

532.57 533.87 B: (( oh yes )) 

533.27 537.49 A: and we need you know we need small businesses to grow for 

536.66 537.51 B: grow 

537.56 538.22 B: (( yeah )) 

537.63 547.28 A: for the economy to be strong whereas you know increasing the taxes of someone that already earns a hundred thousand a year is not as big of a burden 

539.55 540.36 B: right 

547.53 551.07 B: (( yeah but is the only thing i know is uh )) 

551.09 553.46 B: (( those that are any more )) 

553.56 556.13 B: have ways of reducing their taxes 

556.47 557.43 A: mhm 

556.72 559.95 B: they they have a lot of tax relief that uh 

560.03 561.92 B: (( they can they can take )) 

562.55 563.39 A: (( right )) 

562.63 563.47 B: (( so if )) 

563.73 565.36 B: so the way government could 

565.67 568.25 B: (( relie- take more from them )) 

568.98 573.70 B: um and put it back onto the low income group 

571.88 574.84 A: mhm 

574.32 575.52 B: (( it would help a lot )) 

575.45 578.15 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

577.94 578.94 B: so 

579.10 585.81 A: so it's probably one of the uh i think [noise] we we can probably agree that 

579.39 580.38 B: uh 

585.87 589.12 A: that for a parent uh 

589.15 599.95 A: for for a family with say uh with a wife a husband and one child it's probably not possible at five dollars and fifteen
