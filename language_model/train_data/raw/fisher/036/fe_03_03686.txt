18.65 23.53 A: okay um first i want to ask you wh- what's the um minimum wage out there 

19.22 19.94 B: so 

23.18 29.62 B: i don't know what it is ah i thought it was a nationwide ah you know ah nationwide it was the same thing 

27.74 28.99 A: all just one 

29.73 32.41 A: (( oh yeah i don't know anything about no )) 

32.49 41.22 A: thing our landlord they they pay um young kids that's in school like middle school like fifteen sixteen years old they pay them that 

37.27 38.19 B: uh-huh 

40.39 46.82 B: okay five fifty is is it ah oh so oh so they're already paying that there and the minimum it's it's already there 

42.55 43.45 A: (( but )) 

45.10 54.97 A: ah but that's just for young people it's like the older you is the more they pay you because you know you're adult and you gotta pay your bills and live and and stuff like that but um [noise] 

51.99 52.85 B: uh-huh 

55.46 61.29 A: i don't know that the f- i i thought it was like um they raised it something like five seventy five or whatever [noise] 

60.86 69.95 B: i haven't heard anything about the minimum wage being raised recently i'm kinda suprised usually you hear all about it for you know [laughter] like a month or so beforehand but um 

69.86 81.19 B: i mean i i- it seems to me i i have my brother ah has a degree in economics and furthermore he loves to argue and so i've heard you know quite a bit about his ah 

77.89 80.48 A: (( [laughter] too [noise] )) 

81.27 85.35 B: thoughts on minimum wage and it's and one some of the points he's made is like 

85.04 85.69 A: [cough] 

85.64 86.86 B: well of course 

87.07 101.25 B: as soon as you raise the minimum wage the short side of you is hey cool you know the employees are making more money which which is great now but then it always comes back around you know when the employers then have to pay more money to hire them and eventually they have to you know 

94.16 95.27 A: mhm [noise] 

101.41 113.01 B: ah you know raise their prices and you know maybe people have fewer jobs because of that or i- it you know i- they raise it and event- i mean the more you raise it then the more you need to raise it so why even 

106.54 107.65 A: yeah 

110.66 112.27 A: the more cut backs [noise] 

113.42 120.66 B: why even bother and then ah another point that he and i i think maybe other's have i've heard made is um 

115.14 116.00 A: true 

121.10 133.97 B: well what is the minimum wage supposed to be for i mean it it seems like if if you're if the idea is that the minimum wage is supposed to be a a wage that someone could earn and and ah you know survive on 

134.05 142.90 B: well gosh in that case even whatever it is now or whatever they're proposing to raise it to is is not going to be sufficient ah we we can't hope to make it 

143.11 152.38 B: accomplish that goal so in that case what what is a minimum wage supposed to do i- ah do you seriously intend it to be a living wage or is it 

152.76 153.83 B: (( ah )) 

152.91 154.79 A: yeah 

153.99 157.29 B: you know r- r- and so that is that your understanding of what it's supposed to be 

158.00 164.78 A: yeah i i don't know what it's supposed to be i don't i don't see the point wh- wh- what can a person do out there five fifteen [noise] 

164.54 174.90 B: yeah i mean if you work full time on a minimum wage ah and even if then you can get forty or you know forty more ah hours a week on a minimum wage whatever job it is um 

175.42 178.28 B: i i think ah i i'm not sure that ah 

178.56 180.18 B: you could ah 

180.85 183.55 B: really ah survive on that anyway so 

181.10 182.13 A: (( yeah you )) 

182.79 185.19 A: no you can't in this ah [laughter] 

183.71 187.65 B: so it's either [laughter] it's like like they want you to make up your mind e- either 

187.49 197.01 B: if you really want to be on a living wage well then really you know really raise it up to what into some amount and then and then figure out what what how to handle whatever economic consequences there are gonna be 

196.94 207.12 B: or forget about it in that case even lower it [laughter] if the idea is to make it such a crummy wage that people are then you know ah ah motivated to get better jobs i don't i m- you know i j- i just don't know what ah 

200.42 201.94 A: [laughter] oh no 

207.69 212.75 B: ah it's a fundamental misunderstanding on my part what you know what what 

211.49 215.44 A: yeah i recently i recently read that like um 

215.89 217.47 A: the minimum 

216.93 218.67 B: (( mhm )) 

217.84 219.21 A: (( ah wage )) 

219.94 232.18 A: to live off ah would be like ten fifty [noise] an hour you can't live off none less than that in these day and times because of prices and the rent and all that so i i i guess it would have to be raised to ten fifty [laughter] to be you 

226.05 227.09 B: mhm 

232.20 234.78 A: know able to live off live off it 

232.34 233.27 B: okay 

233.65 246.22 B: yeah yeah right so now let's see what would my brother ah say about that or actually i think i've even heard you know the employers themselves make this argument even when they have to raise it like ten or fifteen cents they say okay you know we raise it this much then 

246.54 252.31 B: sorry we're gonna go out of business and then then we're not we [laughter] then we're not hiring anybody so 

251.50 252.96 A: (( [noise] 'cause of fifteen cents )) 

253.11 254.30 B: mhm 

253.28 255.75 A: [laughter] over fifteen cents 

255.65 260.34 B: over fif- over fifteen cents if they have to you know completely double it um 

259.33 260.62 A: (( yeah true )) 

260.39 268.57 B: then certainly you know if if that were required then there'd be one heck of a lot more people going out of business ah and you know and not hiring people so 

268.86 270.09 B: [lipsmack] i mean what 

270.40 279.16 B: sometimes like my brother he talks about this economic stuff as say's well okay you know wh- wh- why don't i ever hear any politicians saying this and the obvious answer is you know it'll lose them votes but i mean 

277.77 278.87 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

279.18 286.16 B: what would happen if they actually said that would would people just ignore 'em or would someone say oh yeah you're right and then just vote 'em out of office or what [laughter] 

285.87 288.78 A: no they wouldn't they don't they don't i don't think they care 

288.36 289.79 B: yeah 

289.12 300.82 A: i really don't [laughter] minimum wage i mean i used to make minimum wage i used to work for you ever heard of a temporary company called this was when i was like fifteen years old but it the ah temp's called labor ready 

290.35 291.27 B: so 

296.93 297.76 B: uh-huh 

301.13 305.21 B: i've heard of them i i temped for a [lipsmack] place called olsten one time 

305.23 306.21 B: (( but ah )) 

305.23 310.32 A: oh my god labor ready you do the hardest work in the world 

309.91 310.83 B: uh-huh 

310.68 314.34 A: and they pay you like five fifteen an hour [laughter] 

313.99 315.27 B: yeah 

314.64 316.69 A: they tax you real good [laughter] 

315.97 327.50 B: and i mean yeah and i mean i mean i i was making minimum wage the summer i worked in a you know in a in a mall ah cookie bakery but that was when i was in high school and didn't have to pay rent you know [laughter] 

323.55 324.76 A: oh okay 

326.78 329.20 A: yeah just spending 

329.33 330.17 A: (( [laughter] )) 

330.15 331.15 B: well 

330.36 331.84 A: yeah [laughter] 

332.00 343.80 B: well so if um if raising it i mean if if if raising it to the full amount that you know that th- that is going to be the livable wage of ten ten fifty is that what you said 

343.10 344.32 A: yeah ten fifty 

343.96 345.61 B: i mean if that's completely 

345.62 346.83 A: (( that's the minimum )) 

345.94 358.53 B: if that's where it needs to be raised to be a liveable wage and that's completely out of the question in that case then we've decided that it you know minimum wage if it if it cannot be a liveable wage then in that case 

358.68 359.54 B: (( ah )) 

359.61 367.41 B: what is it supposed to do and in that case is five fifteen gonna do it or would would four you know four dollars and fifty cents do it 

367.61 369.27 B: so um [lipsmack] 

369.85 375.61 B: ah now if y- i i've heard people like you know rush lindball say yes it should be low you know to so to get these 

375.73 388.35 B: you know lazy bums who are gonna ah that you're not supposed to be happy with the minimum wage drop you know you have your th- wages low enough and you're gonna go out and and you know ah magically find a better job [laughter] 

378.12 379.44 A: why 

388.07 389.65 A: that's not true you're 

389.92 391.04 B: so um 

390.09 394.90 A: gonna be depressed and poor sad and not motivated [laughter] 

394.21 395.09 B: uh-huh 

394.92 409.25 B: well i mean i in that i guess the comeback to that would be well um yeah and and so and and you'd also be that way at you know five fifteen an hour if that were the only job you were doing you know and you have to your gonna wind up having to put two or three jobs together 

409.65 410.97 B: (( to ah )) 

411.20 413.47 B: you know to to make a living uh-huh to you 

413.41 419.56 A: my minimum is eight because i i made eight an hour for the longest stretch of my 

420.16 429.98 A: first very very first job and then i went to that afterwards oh my god um [lipsmack] but if it's about eight i can live of eight here in atlanta 

431.19 432.93 B: (( know the rent and stuff's pretty cheap )) 

431.94 432.69 A: (( uh-huh )) 

432.79 442.89 A: and yeah but um yeah that five fifteen that's that's ridiculous man that's ridiculous and you know i- i the thing i really hate they they were hiring ah i mean 

443.11 450.83 A: or whatever they're more considerate you know they like okay this is an adult 'cause i i was not supervised for them and 

445.05 445.96 B: (( you know uh-huh )) 

450.69 461.44 A: they started me at like ah eight twenty five and during this this orientation process all the other people was like younger at high school middle school 

461.21 462.00 B: mhm 

461.23 466.95 A: and they told them your gonna get five seventy five you're gonna get five fifteen you know and it's like i was like what the hell 

466.80 480.28 A: i was like why am i getting paid more and i was told it was basically because of my age or whatever but i think a lot of companies should do that because i mean it that's ridiculous i step in the door to some places and like the most they can offer is like ah five fifty an hour 

480.39 482.08 A: (( like what the hell )) 

481.39 483.17 B: mhm 

482.45 491.51 A: yeah i think that's that's bad and all the others should should at least consider ah you know the age and that people have families and stuff like that you know 

491.79 496.91 A: (( but like i said earlier yeah i don't think they really care anyway you know it's more like the money )) 

496.78 497.77 B: (( yeah )) 

497.05 504.15 A: the money they're getting in their pockets that [sigh] so i think that's bad you know i i maybe we i don't know but i 

504.25 507.16 A: (( voting and it in i don't know )) 

508.36 511.41 B: well i'm i i didn't catch that last part folk 

508.37 509.45 A: (( you know you know )) 

510.68 517.03 A: i mean like if e- if enough people complain about it and really try to do something about it i think that it it could get raised 

513.25 514.12 B: uh-huh 

517.81 526.40 B: well i mean getting off the minimum wage ah a little bit just i- in order to j- just getting to the goal of of minimum wage um 

526.36 535.16 B: if we if we throw away the other option that like you know no it's not supposed to be a living wage it's supposed to be a wage that you know motivates you to you know not want to make minimum wage 

535.23 545.28 B: if if we say that well no we we do want to have an object of you know having every american able to you know work at a job that allows them to to you know make a make a living 

545.60 547.16 B: (( [lipsmack] ah if )) 

545.90 548.48 A: but see then br- oh go ahead 

547.79 556.77 B: i'm saying you know if if a minimum wage is not the way to do that then i wonder what what else what are the ways that might be of ah yeah trying to accomplish that goal 

556.89 560.14 A: what to m- to motivate people i mean then oh 

558.44 564.47 B: no no no no i mean the goal of you know if if if the goal of minimum wage really is then to um 

564.87 571.11 B: try to ensure that you know everyone can work at a job and make money make a living wage 

571.17 572.77 B: from that job 

572.86 573.88 B: um 

573.98 584.60 B: if if the minimum wage isn't gonna do it now and um and and it doesn't seem like it's possible to make a minimum wage do that i mean i'm wondering is there's some other sort of creative 

585.56 588.15 B: ah kind of approach um 

587.42 593.03 A: ah ah i think it should be set the pay wages should be set to ages 

593.13 594.03 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

593.15 599.89 A: at whatever age you is you know you you make a minimum allowance you know it you know not mentioning you know 

597.07 598.18 B: okay
