10.16 15.08 A: well i really don't think that that is enough especially in today's economy 

15.61 18.31 B: yeah me too i think it's kinda 

18.54 21.28 B: i don't know it's kinda silly it's got so low 

20.15 26.32 A: it is really silly 'cause you know when you listen to the news everything the price and everything is going up 

21.65 22.59 B: [laughter] 

26.31 27.89 B: yep [laughter] 

27.21 31.80 A: and that's you know five fifteen really cannot cannot you know have any effect on 

32.70 34.27 A: on one's um 

34.91 36.91 A: responsibilities these days 

36.78 37.73 B: yeah 

37.19 39.15 A: financial responsibilities 

38.77 41.28 B: (( hm )) 

39.88 41.50 A: (( so what do you think about it )) 

41.33 44.19 B: yeah i think it i don't know i think you

48.41 50.68 B: high school kids that's about it 

49.16 50.63 A: [mn] exactly 

50.81 52.00 A: [noise] i agree 

50.84 62.19 B: otherwise yeah otherwise it's i don't know it's doesn't do anything it gets us kind of like politics it's like um feels like laws and rules [laughter] and some of them are useless 

61.88 62.90 A: right 

63.46 66.83 A: yeah with five fifteen it it's nothing 

66.74 67.61 B: (( yep )) 

66.90 69.29 A: (( 'cause really when you calculate that )) 

69.58 70.82 A: (( let's say that )) 

71.39 73.62 A: let's say with seven dollars a day 

74.62 75.59 B: (( yeah )) 

74.98 78.27 A: you know calculate that times five days a week 

78.62 79.91 B: yeah and then there's 

79.36 81.94 A: and plus taxes have to be taken out of that 

81.61 83.81 B: yep that's the other thing 

83.44 85.33 A: you know one cannot live on that 

85.30 86.11 B: no 

85.45 92.01 A: and stuff like you said a high school student or or one who really doesn't have any kind of financial obligations 

91.68 93.45 B: that's right 

92.98 94.17 A: (( [laughter] )) 

93.61 97.28 B: [laughter] wow we agree [laughter] 

95.77 97.84 A: [laughter] yeah we have 

97.50 103.45 B: [laughter] hm you think it'll go up at all or no probably not 

102.87 107.38 A: i don't think so because for the longest while it was five dollars 

107.05 108.13 B: (( oh yeah )) 

107.48 108.60 A: wasn't it 

108.89 112.16 B: (( oh yeah i think even less was five )) 

111.24 116.27 A: yes it it was like that for for many years it's only recently went up 

114.28 115.33 B: yes 

117.17 119.11 B: to like nothing [laughter] 

118.47 122.24 A: yeah it is like nothing but fifty cents cannot reflect anywhere it 

122.18 123.32 B: yep 

122.82 124.14 A: (( really can't )) 

125.69 128.34 B: (( hm )) 

125.74 127.21 A: (( [laughter] )) 

128.24 131.32 A: (( um [laughter] huh )) 

128.85 130.99 B: (( there's not much to talk about [laughter] i guess )) 

131.46 133.51 B: really not much to talk about 

132.91 136.55 A: no for ten minutes [laughter] that's a lot of time to talk about that 

136.42 137.98 B: i'm sorry what's that 

137.80 141.11 A: i said ten minutes is a lot of time to talk about that 

140.52 146.88 B: oh yeah about [laughter] that unless we totally don't like disagree with each other then i guess it so 

145.30 148.70 A: right exactly then it really would have a a debate 

148.32 149.54 B: yeah 

148.92 152.66 A: but since we both agree ha- you know agree on the same thing 

152.77 156.46 A: [laughter] so i guess we gotta [laughter] find things 

153.45 154.86 B: (( mm yeah )) 

155.90 156.84 B: yeah 

157.73 160.09 B: but you know there are some people um 

160.37 168.46 B: that we got uh who think minimum wage is a good idea and their uh argument i guess is that um 

160.85 162.70 A: [noise] 

168.83 172.84 B: if the minimum wage were raised to let's say like ten twelve dollars an hour 

172.33 173.79 A: mhm 

172.98 174.84 B: then companies wouldn't hire 

174.85 179.94 B: lesser skilled people or educate people to do the other jobs 

179.65 181.61 A: yeah they may have a point there though 

183.07 184.22 B: but still 

183.51 187.00 A: they might have a point but it's still not enough 

185.47 186.05 B: (( yeah )) 

187.16 188.22 B: yeah 

187.58 199.06 A: [laughter] and and i guess if they're if they really raise if they raise it to ten or twelve dollars an hour like you said then there'd be higher they'd hire less people 

188.25 189.99 B: [laughter] 

199.14 200.15 B: yes 

199.65 204.54 A: you know when when when i suppose to let's say they're gonna hire ten people 

205.11 210.33 A: ten people to take you know to to take care of a p- a project or whatever 

209.91 211.18 B: right 

210.60 214.31 A: then they might hire five [noise] 

212.20 212.97 B: right 

215.14 216.60 A: yeah [noise] 

215.80 216.62 B: (( yep )) 

216.95 220.24 A: so it you know i guess you have to look at um 

220.29 221.71 A: the employers' 

221.83 224.04 A: side of it 

223.17 232.31 B: yeah i i just think like to me i think over long term if uh the minimum wage went up to let's say ten dollars an hour or even nine 

231.19 233.36 A: [noise] mhm 

232.56 238.73 B: i think everything will adjust i mean after like a period of you know a lot of unemployment [laughter] 

238.56 242.31 A: you can't but i would think you know okay let's say even if 

242.41 247.27 A: they don't they don't wanna go up to ten or or twelve dollars at least eight 

247.21 248.77 B: oh yeah that would be 

248.15 251.34 A: at least eight might be a little more um you know livable 

251.38 252.50 B: yeah 

251.93 259.95 A: one can live on that depending on their again the financial obligations 'cause then you have you know you have all the 

259.99 263.05 A: the rent and the all this and the that to pay 

263.16 265.05 A: (( eight dollars an hour is nothing )) 

265.25 267.00 B: (( yeah it [laughter] certainly isn't )) 

266.40 268.17 A: [laughter] 

267.28 269.42 B: unless everything else goes down [laughter] 

269.10 271.24 A: right and that's not gonna happen 

271.22 273.64 B: no that's not gonna it's gonna go the other way 

272.09 274.19 A: (( not gonna happen )) 

273.82 275.80 B: it's gonna go way the other way [laughter] 

275.19 278.02 A: right always the other way it's always goes up 

277.68 278.65 B: yep 

278.12 283.42 A: [laughter] you know they always say what goes up must come down but not that [laughter] 

281.77 284.60 B: not that [laughter] or taxes not that either 

283.48 286.12 A: [laughter] that would definitely not come down 

287.14 297.14 B: hm so what do you think about well what do you think of well i guess there're like people that make lots of money i think they should maybe take a little bit of a cut and mi- the minimum wage go up 

295.81 303.81 A: oh no that wouldn't happen because you realize that some people or most people the more they get is the more they want 

303.81 304.89 B: (( uh yeah )) 

304.24 306.37 A: they're still not satisfied because 

306.61 310.25 A: see another thing is that they their lifestyles 

310.85 314.56 A: is geared towards them the amount of money they make their income 

314.81 316.17 B: oh yeah that's 

315.39 323.53 A: you know what i mean so their life is already set up that way they would not wanna take a cut because than that mean they'll have to cut out some of the um 

316.31 317.42 B: mhm 

323.60 325.77 A: the fringe benefits they enjoy 

325.93 331.95 B: i wish they would just a little bit 'cause i mean their fringe benefits are like way fringe benefits 

331.59 334.70 A: but but to us though they're not to them 

334.61 335.61 B: (( oh )) 

335.22 336.51 A: [laughter] 

335.84 337.47 B: that's true that's true 

336.74 338.89 A: yeah to us not them at all 

338.61 340.07 B: [laughter] 

339.65 340.95 A: (( [laughter] isn't )) 

340.20 345.97 B: kinda strange one some of these people are making say twenty five million dollars a year or more 

345.90 347.69 A: (( that unfair )) 

348.11 355.29 A: when you look at some people who make so much money and some make almost nothing 

352.03 353.10 B: i know 

355.54 356.41 B: (( yeah )) 

355.84 358.52 A: it's really you know one extreme to the other 

358.71 359.93 B: yeah it's like 

359.30 360.65 A: it really is 

361.21 362.85 B: (( hm )) 

361.28 363.16 A: (( so how long have you been doing these )) 

363.37 365.20 B: these uh phone things 

364.33 365.62 A: calls uh-huh 

365.41 367.60 B: this is only my second one [laughter] 

366.94 370.52 A: oh this is my first i missed last nights 

368.06 369.33 B: oh your first 

370.21 378.72 B: oh i didn't do last night but um two days ago i did what did i do i did uh i did like the whole iraq disarming thing 

378.19 379.58 A: oh 

379.23 380.08 B: (( uh-huh )) 

379.84 384.22 A: yeah they called last time my daughter and said that i missed i missed the um 

384.49 389.46 A: the the cues the prompts you know to to punch in whatever whatever 

389.17 390.39 B: oh yeah 

389.82 391.76 A: so i wasn't able to get on so 

391.34 394.04 B: i just what i do is i just call the number 

393.99 396.17 A: i did though but it said um 

396.44 399.45 A: they couldn't take your call at the time leave a message 

399.51 400.35 B: (( really )) 

399.72 402.00 A: and yet it gave you business hours 

401.75 402.91 B: (( oh )) 

402.46 404.72 A: so i i didn't bother to leave a message 

404.41 406.33 B: (( [laughter] no [laughter] )) 

405.66 409.71 A: [laughter] yes i i think we agree on the same thing though 

409.43 411.28 B: yeah we do [laughter] 

410.56 412.41 A: we do agree on the same thing 

412.06 414.68 B: but you know out here i live in california 

414.19 415.67 A: mhm 

414.77 420.35 B: so out here there was like a big issue with uh minimum wage raising it 

419.92 420.90 A: (( mhm )) 

420.50 431.19 B: and like a certain area of town and i don't know if it passed or not it probably didn't it they wanted to r- in certain areas they wanted to raise it to what was it ten dollars an hour 

430.64 435.46 A: really that one might not pass to go from five dollars to ten 

431.53 432.38 B: yeah 

435.37 436.42 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

435.77 438.93 A: i doubt that well i live in new york 

436.74 438.05 B: (( no [laughter] )) 

439.78 440.63 B: oh 

440.83 443.60 A: i live in new york and you know the cost of living in new york 

443.12 446.69 B: yes i've heard i think it's more expensive than here [laughter] 

446.08 451.17 A: yeah new york the cost of living is high but isn't california another um 

452.61 454.86 A: high cost of living um state too 

454.60 458.42 B: oh yes like los angeles that's where i am so we get 

457.72 459.03 A: oh okay 

459.13 461.26 A: yeah you know how um 

461.55 463.13 A: high cost of living 

462.95 471.66 B: yeah so we went to like the midwest well it wouldn't matter anyways [laughter] but then the jobs would be less and less paying and all that [laughter] 

466.43 468.89 A: (( yeah )) 

471.68 473.82 A: yeah but but remember in the um 

474.37 476.75 A: in w- in some of those states where 

477.71 480.49 A: their cost of living is not as high as ours 

480.31 481.61 B: right 

481.20 483.27 A: so it really make a difference 

483.24 486.82 B: well it depends on the jobs also i would think 

486.23 490.33 A: you've got a job that pay less there because the cost of living is less 

490.25 491.09 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

490.47 494.96 A: so in those case i doubt that they you know they really um like 

495.04 496.45 A: to have the 

497.31 499.92 A: minimum wage raised 

499.82 501.64 B: probably not 

500.95 502.64 A: yeah i don't think so 

503.64 509.66 A: but but for new york five dollars or five fifty is definitely not high enough 

510.96 512.54 A: definitely not 

513.25 514.21 B: [laughter] 

514.03 517.34 A: (( [laughter] how many minutes do you think we've gone so far [laughter] )) 

516.89 520.59 B: wow is was that ten minutes no it wasn't [laughter] 

519.76 521.76 A: we didn't make ten yet 

521.31 522.83 B: oh my goodness 

522.92 524.11 B: (( last night )) 

523.11 526.33 A: (( because they said they'll let you know when ten minutes is up )) 

525.29 530.62 B: oh boy see last time that one just like it just went by like that [laughter] 

529.47 533.34 A: okay w- w- last night's topic was more uh challenging 

533.85 535.12 B: oh yes 

534.55 536.49 A: yeah would be more challenging 

537.06 541.07 A: [laughter] so do you know if these calls are recorded 

537.78 538.60 B: uh 

540.30 542.06 B: they are recorded 

541.60 543.38 A: no i'm asking you do you know 

543.06 544.69 B: i have no idea they 

543.96 545.36 A: (( oh i don't know either )) 

545.48 548.83 B: give you all like it is a test or some kind 

548.30 549.93 A: yeah you never know 

548.86 551.21 B: how people react or something 

550.60 555.10 A: (( yeah but i think it's supposed to give you comments after )) 

555.44 556.97 B: um 

556.36 558.00 A: didn't it say that 

557.95 561.75 B: yeah it did say something like that but i think but i think it's it's optional though 

559.31 561.17 A: yeah it said something like that 

561.59 562.87 A: yeah okay 

562.58 564.26 B: so i don't know [laughter] 

563.83 567.78 A: [laughter] but i i don't think five fifteen's enough
