33.07 34.11 B: yeah 

33.61 39.16 A: i mean i don't make [laughter] a minimum wage but still there's i mean you know people who 

39.80 44.43 A: can't find something better ah and it costs too much to live anymore 

44.45 45.50 B: (( that's true )) 

45.90 48.59 A: i mean the cheapest rent around here 

49.21 54.24 A: or or even a mortage is like six twenty for a two bedroom

88.03 89.78 B: (( for a long time )) 

88.04 89.01 A: yeah 

90.81 102.05 B: but yeah i think it's pretty harsh that minimum wage is that low i mean at the very least it should be a living wage something that people can buy food and pay some sort of rent and 

91.06 91.92 A: (( oh )) 

102.75 110.09 B: you know just your very basic necessities should be covered and they should factor that into the amount per hour that they pay you 

110.16 111.73 A: yeah but i mean 

112.12 120.54 A: minimum i mean if you have a car payment and everything minimum your your bills are like eighteen hundred a month [noise]

138.46 147.81 A: an- anymore you have to pay an arm and a leg even with your co-payments for hospital payments and [laughter] five dollars and fifteen cents is not going to cover 

147.92 156.21 A: you know ah four or five days in the hospital if you have to pay a hundred dollars a day there you go you go into debt because just 'cause of that 

152.70 154.51 B: (( [laughter] especially with kids )) 

156.71 163.30 B: yeah especially with kids too it makes it much harder because you not only have to support yourself but

215.38 217.10 A: i i couldn't do it 

215.62 216.41 B: (( definitely )) 

216.99 226.16 B: especially considering the the jobs that you're doing for five dollars an hour are probably the jobs you least want to do or anyone least wants to do 

226.21 230.66 B: you know you should be compensated for that too just the fact that you're 

226.46 227.26 A: (( and ah )) 

230.73 235.86 B: standing in the middle of the grease pit flipping burgers or doing whatever you're doing
