15.88 17.61 A: yeah 

16.98 17.85 B: um 

18.65 19.64 A: so 

18.75 20.32 B: do you happen to be a mormon 

20.25 21.97 A: i am actually [noise] 

21.27 22.67 B: yeah well so am i 

22.50 25.73 A: cool [laughter] good deal [laughter] 

23.89 27.95 B: [laughter] i guess that's not on the topic list though 

27.46 29.55 A: right [laughter] 

28.88 30.89 B: so minimum wage huh 

30.46 32.97 A: yeah i 

31.79 33.46 B: five fifteen 

33.60 34.56 A: (( mm )) 

33.95 37.76 B: i think they said should it be increased to that 

35.54 41.52 A: yeah um i think the question was is that you know is that enough basically 

40.69 42.39 B: was what 

41.96 49.95 A: is i think the question was sort of is that enough you know is minimum wage [noise] sufficient 

50.04 51.91 B: uh-huh i don't think so 

50.11 55.74 A: and i would yeah i don't think so [laughter] i tend to agree what's that 

52.79 54.20 B: (( ah [laughter] )) 

54.69 57.11 B: ah do you know what the minimum wage is 

57.39 60.04 A: they said they said five fifteen 

59.94 64.87 B: yeah and yeah that's what i thought they said and i don't think that's um 

62.30 63.50 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

66.35 67.48 B: um 

67.79 71.31 B: i don't know i guess there's some jobs maybe like 

71.46 74.55 B: but even flipping burgers or something you i mean 

74.56 78.65 B: unle- you know unless you live next door there's expenses to get there 

78.24 80.18 A: (( huh right )) 

78.96 80.30 B: and um 

83.33 85.05 A: i guess it depends on 

85.61 95.02 A: you know i i think with um with kids that just you know a sixteen year old in high school they could you know use that money but 

92.92 95.05 B: (( um you know it's right )) 

95.04 100.95 A: so i can kind of see where they could you know get away with that [laughter] i that sense you know 

101.22 108.15 A: but as far as you know jobs that like you say for people that are trying to make a living there's just no way 

108.63 111.00 A: you could do anything with minimum wage you know 

110.23 111.92 B: no it doesn't um 

112.70 119.73 B: 'cause ah forty hours that would only be a little over two hundred dollars and then you gotta take taxes out 

119.15 120.58 A: (( [noise] right [laughter] [noise] )) 

120.38 121.23 B: so 

121.61 122.53 B: um 

123.62 124.58 B: (( i mean )) 

124.73 128.91 B: i used to live up north and down here in san antonio the 

129.28 131.24 B: wages aren't real high 

131.34 137.84 B: but and the expenses aren't maybe as much as some other places but still you still can't 

131.37 132.30 A: mhm 

137.86 141.45 B: [sigh] i mean you can't already find a place to live for 

141.54 146.54 B: that much let alone have money for utilities or food and 

145.63 147.00 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] right [laughter] )) 

146.80 149.32 B: f- five dollars and fifteen cents 

150.68 155.06 B: you know if they're gonna have a a wage of you know a law that says 

155.11 157.30 B: you have to pay a certain amount 

157.51 159.41 A: mhm 

157.55 163.38 B: ah maybe they should go further and subdivide it into you know 

163.59 165.13 B: the person's 

165.66 169.96 B: you know like if it is a college kid working for the summer or 

170.05 172.59 B: somebody that d- doesn't have a family 

172.32 173.73 A: (( right [noise] )) 

172.86 178.75 B: but somebody that's got a family um you know the there might be a maybe there should be a 

178.95 180.60 B: a different structure 

180.33 182.40 A: (( yeah i know what you're saying )) 

181.05 183.33 B: based on need you know 

183.66 184.67 B: um 

184.97 195.82 A: yeah i think it it's like around here [noise] i mean i honestly don't see every once in a while i'll see a job that that says they'll pay minimum wage most of the time it's 

195.90 201.92 A: you know a couple of dollars more like maybe seven dollars or six fifty you know 

199.10 200.03 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

202.13 204.18 A: (( but )) 

204.98 206.72 A: [cough] you know i'm sure that 

207.28 209.03 A: i think 

209.08 220.79 A: well i don't know i don't know if i have a real problem with you know that policy just because of the fact i don't see a real problem as far as people trying to you know pay people that much 

220.99 221.87 A: you know 

222.39 227.29 A: seems like maybe it's competition or something but the 

227.53 238.83 A: the the s- the standard set by the government isn't necessarily [laughter] the minimum wage as far as you know most jobs [cough] but i don't know that's just my perspective on it but 

238.66 240.16 B: what do you think um 

241.29 247.46 B: like you know five fifteen if we both agree that that's not enough what do you think would be [laughter] 

246.80 249.22 A: [noise] yeah that's [laughter] 

249.42 252.02 A: yeah that's a good question i think 

250.84 257.46 B: 'course when we're deciding this we know that it's ah we're the ones paying taxes that it comes out of 

255.80 256.80 A: mhm 

257.20 258.81 A: exactly [laughter] 

258.58 259.88 B: but um 

260.06 261.03 B: i don't know 

261.07 266.54 A: yeah i don't know either that's [noise] i think that's 

265.53 270.12 B: some reason six dollars seems to come to my mind pretty quick 

270.11 273.15 A: yeah well i think so 

271.42 274.78 B: i mean as opposed to five fifteen 

273.29 277.39 A: (( it [noise] right )) 

275.02 281.11 B: you know i'm not i'd probably have to do some research to come up with a more precise figure but 

277.57 278.23 A: (( [noise] )) 

281.80 284.74 B: i think [sigh] ah i'd um i 

282.39 285.33 A: (( yeah )) 

285.84 291.13 B: don't know six dollars is still not that much but it's a lot better than five fifteen 

291.11 292.92 A: (( yeah [noise] well )) 

293.01 294.40 A: i wonder if that's 

294.81 297.78 A: i'm assuming that they have that you know based on 

298.13 310.04 A: statistics and [noise] maybe there's some you know maybe knowing the reasoning behind it would help us help you know well is that fair is that [laughter] is that working you know [laughter] 

310.39 311.58 A: 'cause that's 

311.91 314.00 A: you know my experience i 

314.60 317.28 A: [noise] most of the jobs i've had have been 

317.76 321.52 A: you know not not super high but they haven't been 

321.71 323.76 A: that low that's usually like 

324.06 327.24 A: well maybe fast food jobs might try and do that i don't know 

328.06 336.28 A: but maybe it would like you said maybe the economy how the economy was doing in areas would 

336.73 338.33 A: would affect that too 

339.28 343.64 A: [noise] 'cause if a standard is set um by the government and then 

343.89 348.55 A: but the economy's such that all jobs are minimum wage pretty much then 

348.71 360.19 A: then maybe the minimum wage in that area would you know [laughter] have to go up higher or [noise] i don't know if that would be feasible but it's kind of a complex thing [laughter] 

361.18 364.82 B: mhm ah well i don't know i'd you know ah ah 

361.42 362.62 A: (( [noise] ah anyway )) 

366.37 368.27 B: i suppose ah 

368.98 370.79 B: you'd have to look at what 

370.81 374.03 B: it takes to provide the basic necessities 

374.06 375.91 A: yeah 

374.69 375.65 B: you know 

375.74 378.18 B: on an average in the whole country 

378.72 379.93 B: and um 

378.77 380.11 A: (( right [noise] )) 

381.04 385.41 B: you know for housing and food and transportation 

386.36 388.16 B: just for one person 

389.43 390.28 B: um 

390.67 396.62 B: to determine if you know the minimum wage would at least give somebody a minimum 

397.10 398.44 B: existance 

398.96 400.32 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

401.65 405.08 A: yeah 'cause i can't like you said i can't see anybody 

405.51 407.86 A: being able to live off of that 

405.65 408.00 B: (( um i mean i i i )) 

408.39 411.45 B: ah i think it's good that there is a minimum that there is a minimum 

415.74 418.03 A: [noise] yeah 'cause like 

418.11 423.68 A: maybe maybe the point of it is to more keep things from happening like you know 

423.88 431.28 A: problems with [laughter] peop- you know children working all day or you know how they i think the history behind it 

431.43 433.07 A: you know getting 

431.97 433.23 B: (( um huh )) 

433.12 439.74 A: the history behind it probably like with you know before people would hire kids and 

438.56 442.37 B: yeah they were paying them nothing yeah 

439.93 441.30 A: nothing you know 

441.79 449.59 A: and that takes advantage of people that can't do anything else but ah you know maybe physical labor or something like that 

449.67 450.98 A: so 

451.90 453.67 A: [noise] anyway i've 

454.08 456.42 A: yeah [laughter] 

456.81 463.81 A: so you're have you had much experience as far as i don't know working in a type of place where 

462.66 466.06 B: [cough] yeah i've i've worked um ah ah 

463.96 465.16 A: that 

466.31 467.51 B: a 

467.60 473.84 B: huge amount of different jobs in my life i'm like fifty four now and 

471.53 474.90 A: mhm oh yeah so you've probably [noise] 

473.87 477.07 B: semi retired but i've done 

477.21 483.95 B: i've had you know a huge amount of different jobs when i was younger especially i've worked in ah 

481.00 483.73 A: mhm 

484.10 485.62 B: done about everything 

486.21 487.01 B: um 

486.25 487.99 A: yeah 

487.79 490.30 B: except for be a millionaire but um 

489.43 491.54 A: [laughter] 

490.81 492.84 B: [laughter] 

491.80 493.67 A: (( missed out on that one huh [noise] )) 

493.80 495.03 B: yeah 

494.07 494.63 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

495.14 496.49 B: and um [lipsmack] 

499.34 500.52 B: i don't know 

502.70 507.80 A: did you ever i don't know feel like the wage you were getting was too little for what 

506.88 508.31 B: ah pardon me 

507.94 514.90 A: did you ever feel like the wage you earned was was not enough for what you were doing i mean was it fair yeah 

512.15 519.25 B: oh yeah yeah but it and it and it was always you know most i'm pretty sure i 

520.63 524.62 B: i don't think i ever worked for minimum wage um 

524.10 525.75 A: right 

524.87 528.31 B: it was always above it but um 

529.63 536.55 B: although it might maybe when i first started off like sacking groceries at a you know grocery store or something ah 

535.82 537.83 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

536.95 538.14 B: but um 

540.46 548.74 A: well that's a funny thing it seems to me the minimum wage is higher than five fifteen now [laughter] when i think about it and like 'cause like 

548.88 561.43 A: my wife had applied to a grocery store here and it was like six fifty an hour that they were paying but maybe that wasn't maybe they were giving extra perks or something [laughter] anyway 

561.32 566.58 B: [noise] well and you know i- i- they can al- you can always pay more than minimum wage i mean 

565.97 567.70 A: yeah 

566.65 568.45 B: you get um 

569.18 574.91 B: you know the the more you pay the more you can demand of your employees and it 

574.68 576.50 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

575.00 578.99 B: it works both ways you know the the better they work the more they can earn 

579.11 580.26 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

579.23 581.55 B: i mean to a certain extent i mean but 

584.65 586.66 B: um um if you've got somebody 

586.86 592.22 B: and you hire 'em at minimum wage and all they do is just show up and do 

592.27 594.34 B: a minimum work then 

594.64 599.89 B: minimum wage is probably all they need and you know i mean with somebody else that that 

596.33 598.01 A: (( mhm yeah [laughter] ))
