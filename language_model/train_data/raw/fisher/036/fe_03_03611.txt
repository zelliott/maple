26.28 27.10 A: (( mhm )) 

28.79 32.30 A: okay how much is it i have no idea 

31.90 34.53 B: um i believe it's five fifteen an hour 

34.15 35.37 A: oh really 

35.06 36.79 B: mhm 

36.59 43.29 A: ah i thought that would be more now because i remember [laughter] when it was like four 

43.40 49.37 A: something four twenty five four seventy five but that was about eight years ago 

46.05 47.42 B: (( mhm )) 

49.17 52.92 B: yeah so do you think it needs to go up 

53.30 54.30 A: um 

54.37 60.87 A: probably i live in boston i don't know how people can survive on five dollars an hour 

60.41 63.45 B: i live in california and you can't [laughter] 

62.78 65.97 A: [laughter] [laughter] you know um 

66.04 73.45 A: i go to the city and i feel really sorry for those people working at the cash registers 

74.01 77.68 A: and they probably don't even get the health benefits 

77.14 80.73 B: no i don't think they do um i mean it's 

80.96 82.58 B: i th- i think 

82.89 93.48 B: we need to go ahead and give them more money and it will help our economy because when you have more money you spend more money 

86.58 87.65 A: mhm 

94.21 96.84 A: (( that's right but )) 

97.75 110.24 A: at the same time in this terrible economy now that i'm interviewing for jobs i don't even know what salary is acceptable for a full time job you know 

109.83 111.05 B: oh what do you do 

111.09 115.47 A: i'm in marketing sales and i just got laid off so 

115.57 116.62 A: um 

117.77 119.92 A: and well but yet 

118.86 122.60 B: were you working for a huge were you working for a large company 

122.16 128.46 A: yes i was working for an international company manufacturing corporation and 

127.67 130.08 B: in marketing wow 

129.14 137.69 A: yes yeah and now i just i don't even know what to ask for [laughter] 

137.84 139.58 A: so um 

139.91 142.33 B: it's it's expensive i mean 

142.86 149.11 B: i i would go to monster dot com and find out how much things are 

146.27 147.81 A: right [laughter] 

149.44 152.78 B: you know how much they're paying in other parts of the country 

154.05 155.65 A: (( right um )) 

154.78 156.14 B: (( it )) 

158.01 165.85 A: but and they don't know and it feels like ah to go and work for a minimum wage wouldn't even make any sense 

165.86 169.38 A: because unemployment pays better you know 

169.60 170.97 A: so i don't know 

171.05 173.96 A: and five twenty five that's about like 

174.09 178.94 A: less than el- eleven thousand a year that's t- definitely not enough 

177.06 182.98 B: it is it it is it is at poverty level and they need really need to 

183.37 187.49 B: increase it like you were saying you make more money 

187.76 188.84 B: um 

190.49 196.13 B: not working than you do at a five fifteen dollar an hour job 

195.74 198.20 A: (( right but at the same time )) 

198.43 201.60 A: i don't know who works at minimum wage now 

201.93 202.98 A: you know 

202.06 202.83 B: (( um )) 

203.85 209.65 B: i think a lot of the people who are working at minimum wage at least out here from what i see 

208.90 210.04 A: really 

210.06 213.28 B: is basically a lot of students 

213.35 215.90 A: well yes probably 

214.09 215.12 B: and 

215.27 218.33 B: and moms or a single parent 

217.85 226.38 A: mhm but you know at the same time we had a janitors' strike here in boston 

225.92 227.09 B: (( mhm )) 

226.88 233.96 A: a few months' ago and they were all you know asking for benefits and all that stuff 

234.64 241.71 A: and i was surprised to find out that they were making like eighteen dollars an hour 

242.09 245.73 B: i know it's surprising a janitor i know it 

242.59 243.55 A: (( a janitor )) 

244.36 248.23 A: [laughter] [laughter] you know that's why 

248.70 249.76 A: i don't 

248.73 252.91 B: yeah i mean here you go to college and you spend six eight years and 

252.05 253.97 A: exactly [laughter] 

252.92 255.16 B: and the janitor is making more than you 

255.30 259.76 A: and ah and up with the students' loans and everything 

259.26 260.22 B: mhm 

260.85 264.95 B: oh i know and at five fifteen an hour it's 

265.36 268.21 B: you can't even pay your student loans back 

268.08 272.93 A: you can't pay for anything you know i don't know rent is just 

273.33 274.91 A: expensive too 

274.11 276.62 B: is rent real expensive in boston 

276.40 281.40 A: oh it's terrible it's outrageous i used to live in ohio 

281.54 285.36 A: and when i moved to boston i was in shock 

286.56 289.62 A: (( and that's the thing you know it's probably )) 

286.87 287.75 B: (( wow )) 

291.04 297.57 A: [sigh] i don't know see i don't work ah i i don't look at jobs at min- minimum wage but um 

295.96 297.06 B: right 

298.67 299.86 A: you know 

299.90 303.60 A: is it countrywide five twenty five an hour 

303.67 304.44 B: (( uh-huh )) 

304.56 307.57 B: it it is it's countrywide 

306.99 308.80 A: because probably at some 

309.01 312.06 A: you know cheaper poorer states 

312.44 315.92 B: well some states are are pretty inexpensive 

312.52 313.98 A: (( it may be enough )) 

315.52 316.75 A: mhm 

316.55 318.01 B: to live 

317.65 318.72 A: right 

318.89 324.20 B: so i know like here well i live in california and i live in the middle of california 

323.77 324.85 A: mhm 

324.26 330.27 B: so it's not the most expensive but it's not the cheapest and for 

326.05 327.10 A: mhm 

327.95 328.99 A: mhm 

330.28 333.50 B: but i my husband and i own our home

420.24 421.35 A: (( mhm )) 

422.51 428.54 B: the the more minimum wage is when you get out to the very rural areas it's 

429.24 436.18 B: [noise] you know minimum wage and i i really do think that they need to go through and 

432.01 432.87 A: right 

437.36 441.34 B: and keep up with the cost of living at least 

443.13 444.33 A: yeah

487.24 489.86 A: i don't know who works for it [laughter] 

490.40 494.30 B: it's i i i think the people who are working there are

497.59 498.59 A: mhm 

498.59 499.94 B: and

504.72 506.49 B: to make ends meet 

506.30 507.76 A: right [mn] 

508.24 515.35 A: i i was working for a minimum wage when i was a student some of those campers' jobs 

514.72 515.70 B: right 

516.28 522.57 A: but ah i would work there because it was convenient you don't have to drive and those were 

521.54 522.51 B: correct 

522.76 524.39 A: easy jobs 

523.73 525.41 B: [noise] correct 

525.30 526.53 A: but 

527.34 529.81 A: at the same time you know it's like 

530.49 534.70 A: probably people i guess it's all the matter of choice 

534.52 537.96 B: (( mhm and also too a lot of retired people )) 

535.25 536.22 A: (( you know ))

573.64 575.65 B: and then there's childcare 

574.83 580.61 A: but you know they're probably getting some s- kind of subsidizing from the state because 

580.94 583.79 A: i can't understand how it's possible 

584.30 590.02 A: and then i can't understand how mcdonalds can find people to work for it 

590.28 593.66 B: i know it it's a huge corporation and it's 

591.17 591.89 A: (( [laughter] ))
