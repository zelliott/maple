1.19 2.36 B: hello 

2.08 3.33 A: hi 

3.52 6.40 A: ah my name is nikki [laughter] how are you [laughter] 

5.12 7.09 B: hi i'm lisa 

7.10 7.98 A: (( okay )) 

8.60 10.89 B: (( ah so minimum wage )) 

12.20 16.12 A: do you ah what is um no i don't think that's sufficient so it 

17.10 20.20 B: on what basis do you not think that that's sufficient 

20.99 22.13 A: um 

22.50 25.48 A: well um i'm a single mom so 

25.91 30.23 A: i mean i'm a college graduate but i know that a lot of us aren't so 

30.10 30.91 B: right 

30.80 32.40 A: i know that that's 

32.45 36.99 A: that's hard for a lot of people i guess it depends on where w- you're talking 

37.03 39.81 A: in california no i don't think it's sufficient 

39.85 42.72 A: i'm from wisconsin there yeah that's plenty 

43.22 44.20 B: really 

43.99 46.00 A: you can live on that there 

47.35 52.74 B: wow i i'm i'm from california and i'm living in new york now and ah 

47.79 49.03 A: (( if if you're )) 

52.58 64.29 B: i feel like that's just not i mean you can not raise a family and if you're talking about a single person living you know maybe in wisconsin but i don't think even a family can get raised 

64.53 70.05 B: on on a parent or two parents making five fifteen an hour mm 

69.87 71.96 A: um n- no not [mn] 

72.68 74.85 A: absolutely not um 

75.03 78.38 A: i mean i i guess i get child support so that makes a difference but 

78.85 79.80 A: um 

80.65 84.49 A: but no i mean i never i never made that little but 

84.56 98.11 A: i know like rents are cheaper there and and things are cheaper but like there's no way i could do it out here there's no way it would never work [laughter] so good thing i went to college i guess but that it's yeah that's just too little 

98.40 99.23 A: um 

99.11 103.51 B: but i think the scary thing is that with today's economy a college 

103.52 106.30 B: graduate is not even secured 

106.98 108.75 B: above minimum wage 

108.74 118.08 A: oh definitely not i mean l- like definitely not i mean i had to start out at if it weren't for my ex husband i wouldn't be able to do it and i'm 

117.99 132.49 A: absolutely certain that that um i'm quite lucky [laughter] 'cause i've you know i mean i mean i know that there's a lot of of women that don't have that help and i can't imagine being a couple and and trying to raise a family on that 

122.31 123.25 B: yeah 

132.63 133.67 B: (( that's true )) 

132.72 134.29 A: or without it 

134.16 148.37 B: i think that the most interesting thing about minimum wage is that it's always the hardest workers that earn it i mean i've worked incredibly menial jobs and i'm currently a graduate student so i have my college education but i was doing the menial jobs 

148.32 156.85 B: um and i was making above minimum wage and i wasn't doing anything that's so strenuous or that required anything 

156.92 157.82 B: (( i mean )) 

157.87 167.16 B: anything that anyone else couldn't have done and that's what always surprises me is that the people who are out there you know physical labor working really hard those are the ones that make the least amount of money 

167.23 168.55 A: absolutely 

168.84 173.28 A: and um in in certain fields too i think it's it's harder and 

173.67 174.59 A: um 

176.18 184.91 A: i know that that a lot of women end up ah even college graduates undertaking jobs like that um that are minimum wage because they 

185.52 189.15 A: tend to be um more flexible with hours [laughter] 

189.24 190.13 B: right 

189.38 192.17 A: um th- they tend to be easier jobs to replace 

192.73 203.89 A: um you don't want to get a really good job and then have to quit because or get fired because your child gets sick or you have to leave work early to go do this or that with to to to take care of your kids and [mn] 

204.83 212.45 A: and so you maybe end up sacrificing what you wanted to do with what you know you have to do because you know that they won't fire you for it or you can you know 

212.74 213.57 A: um 

215.82 219.79 A: and and usually minimum wage jobs offer the worst benefits too [laughter] 

219.94 222.91 B: that's well or if they do offer benefits 

222.48 223.82 A: yeah 

223.52 233.26 B: i think that's key and especially because most of them don't i mean what i think of minimum wage is mostly like migrant workers or um 

233.28 237.69 B: you know people bus boys or something like that who 

238.13 251.03 B: really have big families and can need the benefits the most and you know let alone that they're making minimum wage they don't have the benefits and so i mean there's no way to do that it's you can barely even do it on seven dollars an hour with benefits 

244.24 244.92 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

251.03 260.08 A: right i know when i was younger i used to think it was a lot and i i when i was you know before i had children i i i remember thinking like oh wow i'm making so much money and 

252.31 253.27 B: and so 

260.00 266.62 A: you know but i was living at home and i wasn't making payments for all kinds of things that you have to pay for when you're an adult 

266.66 272.20 A: and i'd i it never occurred to me that there were people that were working with me that were grown up 

272.43 280.07 A: and they were making the same amount of money as me and how they did it i cannot even imagine [laughter] 

279.17 279.99 B: yeah 

280.01 281.68 B: what what do you do 

282.10 291.03 A: um i work [laughter] i work as a booking agent at an escort service now [laughter] but it's i don't i i make more than minimum wage 

291.36 295.35 A: but at the time um when i was making minimum wage um 

291.65 292.55 B: (( oh that's )) 

295.95 299.09 A: [cough] i worked um at a t._v. studio 

301.03 303.42 A: and after that 

303.66 304.60 A: um 

304.93 319.47 A: like when my children were little and i wasn't doing as well i worked as a waitress because you could make more money and it was a hard job but it was better than minimum wage you know bartending it was long hours on your feet and it was hard work but 

320.62 322.71 A: you know it offered 

323.65 333.32 A: no benefits but i had m- more money and i ha- you know i didn't want to do it i wanted to work in my field um i have a communications degree but i just couldn't afford to 

334.29 335.11 A: um 

334.32 335.19 B: wow 

336.18 342.68 A: yeah and i'm sure i'm su- i'm sure i'm not the only one that's gotten kind of trapped into that you know 

336.88 338.99 B: that must be hard right 

342.98 348.68 A: i went to school for this but i have to do this because the you know when you first get done with college 

349.27 354.39 A: generally you don't make a lot of money i mean a lot of jobs especially in california a lot of them are 

354.68 360.08 A: they want to offer internships and not get paid at all [laughter] so you're lucky if you get something that's 

361.83 362.77 A: (( so it's )) 

362.13 364.07 B: i mean i i i guess it's you know 

364.11 369.91 B: what is the value of a college education these days 'cause i remember in my parents' generation 

370.40 384.58 B: a high school diploma was of utmost importance and then when i was growing up you couldn't go anywhere without a college education and now it seems like that doesn't even do you any good and it's all about graduate school and experience and 

381.08 381.89 A: right 

383.87 384.62 A: (( well )) 

385.37 395.87 A: oh yeah absolutely i mean my dad had a great job i i i mean it wasn't it was physically demanding until he was there for a while but he worked for the railroad he graduated from high school and that's all 

396.01 400.52 A: and he made you know by the time he retired he was making like sixty thousand dollars a year 

400.97 405.03 A: and in rural wisconsin that's a lot of money and 

405.27 409.74 A: i could never hope to make that even with a college degree not not um 

410.02 415.08 A: not without moving up in my position and really really working hard at it 

415.18 416.01 A: um 

416.99 420.06 A: i mean he basically just worked there that long he didn't 

420.12 420.85 B: (( wow wow )) 

420.42 424.08 A: he didn't you know finish up as like a [laughter] 

424.60 431.33 A: a c._e._o. or anything i mean he was just still basically in the same you know he was unskilled labor 

431.37 434.10 A: um like a tooling guy type of person 

434.57 444.73 A: which i mean he had to do a lot of training for it but it was still not it wasn't college it wasn't it was all on the job and that just doesn't really happen anymore 

445.17 446.45 B: that's true 

447.29 453.38 B: and i think that with the sacrifices have to come and it's what what you're willing to sacrifice 

454.62 456.28 A: right 

456.56 458.59 A: but i kn- i know like um 

458.66 462.10 A: there's a hotel across the street and all the people it's all 

462.71 465.44 A: [cough] it's all um latina 

466.90 467.81 A: um 

467.85 479.88 A: and latina m- men and women that that have to that do it because it's it's crappy pay and they're working really hard i mean they're working really long hours i see the same people every day early and late 

480.22 488.45 A: and you know they're not making that much money and and so you're right it is like the crappiest jobs and it is the hardest work that 

487.45 489.33 B: and they have the best ethics 

489.59 492.27 A: yeah absolutely absolutely 

489.64 494.79 B: they're there every day and they're not complaining and it's amazing 

495.32 496.79 A: definitely not 

496.87 503.10 A: i know i could- i couldn't but i remember me thinking when i was young once i get done with college everything's going to be great i'm going to have it made 

503.89 511.86 A: and i know i worked in a t._v. studio for two years and i felt like i ended up with like a dollar raise total and i started out at a little bit over minimum wage 

511.74 512.79 B: wow 

513.28 516.77 A: and that was with you know a college degree 

517.17 518.28 A: and 

519.05 522.49 A: i mean if it weren't for my ex i probably wouldn't have been okay 'cause 

523.28 531.02 A: i i got used to having things you know when i was in school i was getting loans and i was getting grants and that i got used to living a certain way 

531.77 533.06 A: which isn't even 

531.81 533.37 B: what what does he do 

533.48 537.54 A: which wasn't even good i mean it was just it was just not not um 

537.99 538.69 A: (( [laughter] )) 

538.85 540.72 A: not struggling not 

541.14 545.03 A: i mean it wasn't like we were living that fantastic we just weren't 

545.46 553.65 A: i wasn't working all the time and i wasn't you now because i was in school and i i got a lot of grants because i had good grads and a scholarship but [cough] 

555.25 558.19 A: so i can't imagine what it was like for people that 

558.54 561.54 A: that don't even have the opportunity to finish school or or 

561.76 566.91 A: and and to try and i worked at a at a rental car place and i remember we were hiring a 

567.50 570.41 A: a car detailer just a car to wash cars and 

570.80 577.88 A: the manager wouldn't hire this [laughter] one guy because he he was like fifty six he was retired from his his job 'cause he got hurt 

578.05 582.14 A: and he had never graduated from high school but he ran his own business for like thirty five years 

582.23 583.16 B: (( wow ah oh )) 

583.16 587.89 A: and she actually said right to his face oh you never finished school huh [laughter] and i'm like 

588.31 593.81 A: you've got to be kidding me he's you know it's a car washing position for minimum wage and you're 

595.16 597.64 A: worried about his high school diploma 

598.56 599.59 A: (( [sigh] )) 

598.61 599.95 B: god oh that's amazing
