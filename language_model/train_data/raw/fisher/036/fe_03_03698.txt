1.08 3.09 A: hi my name is sarah 

1.38 2.59 B: (( priscilla )) 

3.37 5.10 B: (( hi sarah i'm priscilla )) 

5.11 6.64 A: it's nice to meet you 

6.57 8.12 B: [laughter] nice to meet you 

8.28 13.49 A: okay this should be interesting [lipsmack] well i feel minimum wage should be a little bit higher 

14.00 27.29 B: yeah i actually um i agree with that i do feel that it should be higher than that you know given the cost of living and basic things that you need to do such as rent car payments um 

27.76 30.31 B: utilities transportation 

30.58 43.00 B: ah just other basic needs that you have and i certainly don't think that five fifteen an hour um multiply that by eight hours a day multiply that by forty hours in a week is sufficient for yeah so 

40.03 41.74 A: it's not nearly enough 

43.74 44.84 A: and um 

43.95 44.64 B: (( hm oh )) 

44.94 50.41 A: especially because a lot of the work seems to be very grueling i know a lot of the jobs i have had 

48.58 49.50 B: yeah 

50.83 54.03 A: and i feel that a lot of that work is worth more 

55.13 60.72 B: definitely um 'cause when you think of minimum wage you think of of working at a fast food restaurant 

60.75 61.65 A: mhm 

61.06 62.71 B: (( perhaps )) 

62.63 76.32 B: and um just to maintain a standard o- of living i know that ah i certainly make a lot more than minimum wage and i don't even think that the amount that i make is nearly enough to keep me going so i don't see how people do it 

76.25 77.20 A: right 

77.22 81.42 A: well i know in the area that i live in um it's very hard to find jobs period 

81.43 82.92 B: mhm where do you live 

81.56 82.57 A: so alo- 

82.67 84.71 A: gra- um i'm in minnesota 

84.61 86.74 B: minnesota okay i'm in michigan 

85.82 86.59 A: (( yeah )) 

86.90 88.35 A: oh okay okay 

88.22 89.26 B: yeah 

88.48 89.37 A: um 

89.75 95.88 A: but a lot of people have to settle for minimum wage jobs and you know if you're working in a factory or 

95.82 96.98 B: mhm 

96.65 97.71 A: anything 

98.14 100.63 A: it's not nearly enough and if you have children 

100.82 103.81 B: oh gosh forget about that if you have children 

103.15 104.46 A: exactly 

104.52 107.07 A: can't even coupon clip your way out of that 

104.81 105.76 B: yeah 

107.11 108.40 B: (( mm hm )) 

108.85 111.75 A: wow this is harder than i thought it would be [laughter] 

108.90 110.64 B: no it won't be 

110.96 113.61 B: [laughter] it's what 

113.60 116.13 A: it's harder than i thought it would be [laughter] 

115.59 117.35 B: [laughter] yeah it is 

116.56 119.16 A: talking on one subject um 

118.27 120.00 B: [laughter] 

119.18 121.97 A: well i don't even know what is minimum wage right now 

121.94 128.76 B: you know i don't even know i was talking to my brother about that ah the other night but i think he indicated that it may be five fifteen 

128.77 133.92 A: okay 'cause i know i started at four fifteen way back when [laughter] 

129.53 130.44 B: (( that's rea- )) 

133.13 139.88 B: yeah i was just going to say a few years ago when i was working when i was in high school i think i was like at four twenty five maybe 

140.00 141.86 A: yeah that sounds about right 

140.31 140.87 B: (( [mn] )) 

141.44 150.52 B: and that was maybe eight years ago so even if you think of inflation itself it certainly seems as though minimum wage should be at least seven dollars an hour 

150.46 155.05 A: oh definitely just the price of gas and the price of food has gone up so much 

154.69 156.83 B: yeah yeah 

156.87 162.84 A: [noise] and i wonder too how much it goes up um and how often i'm really not up on the statistics 

161.90 171.80 B: yeah obviously it doesn't go up that often if you come to think of it because if it's at five fifteen right now and when i was in high school that was years ago 

166.75 167.77 A: mhm 

172.54 174.72 B: that's a shame 

174.76 179.72 A: oh definitely i mean the only thing i think about is like people who work in daycares 

175.06 175.76 B: hm 

179.89 187.59 A: they're making five fifteen an hour not even it's that's awful taking care of other people's children and they're being paid nothing 

180.20 181.18 B: mhm 

190.01 191.34 B: (( oh yeah )) 

190.49 191.34 A: (( so i don't )) 

192.31 194.32 A: know um 

193.43 194.15 B: hm 

194.53 197.60 A: (( [laughter] what else shall we talk about )) 

195.62 197.29 B: [laughter] 

197.99 205.07 B: uh well i guess we've pretty much established that we we both do feel that it should be increased and it's certainly not enough [mn] 

205.11 206.00 A: right 

205.80 211.54 B: if it's at five fifteen right now it's certainly not enough to maintain basic standards of living 

211.61 216.35 A: and i would think that um the companies would be able to afford that as well 

215.91 219.71 B: mhm yeah they're just trying to keep overheads down [laughter] 

217.59 218.43 A: (( yeah )) 

219.50 222.44 A: mhm as their prices go up and 

221.64 222.93 B: (( yeah )) 

222.77 226.01 A: what not i'm willing to pay a little bit more [laughter] 

223.24 224.89 B: and making huge profits 

226.36 235.54 B: [mn] but you know what the only job that i can think of that it ha- that are probably are are at minimum wage would be fast food restaurants that's the only thing i can think of 

233.80 234.92 A: mhm 

235.03 237.26 A: like mcdonalds and 

236.34 238.25 B: yeah mcdonalds 

237.90 239.14 A: burger king 

239.20 248.57 B: yeah yo- you know you got to give people incentives if you want them to be hard workers because you know the turnover rate is going to be very high in the fast food industry anyways 

248.38 250.42 A: right right and you want to keep them 

250.30 256.23 B: yeah so if you want to keep them you know give them offer them incentives increase the the minimum wage 

251.05 252.17 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

256.88 261.12 A: right and most of them i would think a lot of people are only part time 

261.09 262.07 B: mhm 

261.22 263.15 A: they're not getting benefits 

263.16 265.75 B: yeah no be- yeah you're right about that 

266.93 268.09 B: no benefits 

266.93 268.71 A: that's a whole 'nother thing 

268.88 269.91 B: yeah 

270.88 273.37 A: yeah living is expensive [laughter] 

271.30 271.94 B: (( hm )) 

273.18 282.64 B: it is i was just you know trying to refinance my car and i'm trying to you know take stock of my monthly expenses and you know you've got to 

282.01 286.66 A: all of a sudden you wonder where did all the money go [laughter] there's nothing left over 

284.19 286.57 B: oh yeah it goes so quickly 

286.61 287.97 B: mhm no 

287.46 293.67 A: yeah i'm in i'm in school right now and so i'm trying to figure out all my loans and everything but it's very difficult 

289.48 290.35 B: are you 

294.18 295.35 B: yeah 

296.37 301.02 B: hm h- [laughter] how many minutes has it been so far [laughter] 

296.62 297.66 A: (( um )) 

300.43 304.84 A: (( [laughter] i don't know [laughter] this is going so much slower than i thought it would )) 

305.08 313.92 B: yeah that's a hard topic you know especially since we don't even know what the minimum wage is at right now but i can't imagine making minimum wage 

313.82 315.15 A: no no 

315.41 318.87 A: i know that i started out at that but i was sixteen [laughter] 

318.53 319.93 B: mhm 

319.43 321.66 A: [mn] and i thought that was big money but 

321.56 325.68 B: oh yeah i remember when i first got my pay check [laughter] so many years ago 

324.64 325.49 A: yeah 

325.69 329.56 A: but as a teenager too you think about it there's not a lot that you have to pay for 

329.74 330.76 B: no 

331.50 332.97 B: (( no not at all )) 

332.73 335.24 A: you don't have to make house payments [laughter] 

335.09 336.21 B: no 

337.47 338.69 B: but um 

339.67 344.70 B: yeah i i definitely think it should be at least seven dollars [laughter] an hour 

344.93 346.50 A: oh wouldn't that be great 

346.45 354.71 B: yeah 'cause these companies they make so much money you know off of work it's it's yeah they can certainly afford 

349.76 351.04 A: mhm 

354.93 358.65 B: paying people a bit more than what they currently do hm 

356.92 358.37 A: [noise] yeah i would think so 

359.13 364.08 A: i wonder what do you think a reasonable increase would be let's say that it's at five right now 

363.88 364.75 B: uh-huh 

364.11 366.65 A: i- i'm just pulling that out of my butt but 

367.25 369.25 A: if it's at five now 

369.84 374.25 A: i wonder i don't know even five fifty would be a nice jump [laughter] 

374.40 375.88 B: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

375.30 377.75 A: not not enough of a jump but 

378.12 384.27 B: i really think ah for whatever reason seven dollars an hour is like just stuck in my head 

384.72 391.48 B: because even if you were to work at the mall 'cause i worked at the mall um a couple of years ago over the summer and i was making seven dollars an hour 

385.16 385.77 A: (( and )) 

391.70 394.82 A: were you uh can i ask um were you working full time 

395.08 398.06 B: (( [mn] was i working full time no i was working part time )) 

398.16 399.03 A: okay 

399.55 401.37 A: yeah 'cause even part time e- 

401.77 403.55 A: we need the money it's 

403.46 405.45 B: yeah yeah yeah 

405.52 407.06 B: (( definitely you know )) 

406.00 411.41 A: very difficult and then too um i wonder how many of them make overtime 

407.23 408.24 B: (( are you )) 

411.94 417.45 B: [mn] not a lot you know especially in this day and age you know probably there is no overtime 

417.43 418.47 A: mhm 

418.39 419.00 B: (( [laughter] )) 

419.42 421.34 B: probably there is no overtime 

419.79 421.07 A: big corporations 

422.23 424.85 A: they don't care about the little people [laughter] 

422.28 423.19 B: (( [noise] [lipsmack] )) 

424.44 427.91 B: no they don't all they care about are profits profits profits 

427.66 428.83 A: exactly 

429.09 431.73 A: they charge us money and then they pay us nothing 

431.64 442.86 B: mhm [laughter] i mean it's a shame that the government actually has to impose a minimum wage so to speak you know 'cause you know companies try to get away with as much as they can 

438.67 440.25 A: oh definitely 

442.90 444.97 A: mhm can i ask how old are you 

445.06 446.39 B: i'm twenty six 

446.28 448.10 A: okay i'm twenty three [laughter] 

447.53 451.10 B: (( you're twenty oh okay [laughter] and you're still at school right um you're )) 

449.14 450.42 A: (( i was just kidding )) 

451.19 453.83 B: (( are you in ah are you working on your bachelor's or oh okay )) 

453.35 460.12 A: um i'm working on my masters right now so then i can go and get a minimum wage job [laughter] 

458.64 461.32 B: [laughter] what are you studying if i may ask 

461.33 463.32 A: um computer science 

463.08 463.99 B: okay 

464.20 465.09 A: so 

465.33 467.06 A: and then um what do you do [noise]

527.84 539.60 B: yeah yeah well e- e- just speaking of um li- moving elsewhere like california the cost of living is so high there they definitely should not they should definitely increase the minimum wage

539.62 540.90 A: oh for sure 

539.90 540.79 B: (( you know ))

548.67 549.25 B: (( mhm )) 

548.89 553.72 A: i mean you look at it people would work so much harder if they knew that they were actually getting something 

554.38 555.89 A: for their work 

556.11 558.83 B: exactly something that's reasonable 

558.79 562.65 A: right as you've stated before you know you need some kind of incentive 

560.91 562.03 B: (( yeah )) 

562.34 568.25 B: yeah i mean just getting back and forth to work you know with gas being so expensive
