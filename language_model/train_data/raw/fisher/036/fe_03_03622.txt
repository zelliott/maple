0.99 2.06 B: ken 

1.08 3.07 A: hi my name's kevin 

2.98 4.35 B: hi this is ken 

4.90 5.81 B: how're you 

4.99 5.81 A: yeah 

6.15 9.01 A: (( um good how you doing )) 

8.65 9.90 B: i'm not bad 

9.67 10.49 A: cool 

10.98 16.52 A: um minimum wage five fifteen i don't think five fifteen's enough 

16.21 19.55 B: i don't think five fifteen's enough too y- y- you know actually 

17.59 18.96 A: (( to w- )) 

20.10 34.90 A: um five fifteen might be okay if you're like a high school kid and you just need a little bit extra money for you know pocket money but i don't see how someone could live on five fifteen paying rent and paying bills and maybe even supporting a family and all that so 

35.00 42.27 B: that's true with all those kind of uh spendings keep rising uh i just don't think that five fifteen is is enough 

35.87 36.67 A: yeah 

41.87 49.58 A: right five fifteen doesn't seem like anything and that's before tax i mean that's before you know insurance and healthcare and all that stuff i mean 

49.67 50.43 A: (( no )) 

49.79 60.48 B: i don't think that um i don't think that if you earning some money around like five fif- five fifteen per hour you will get er any kind of health insurance or you will get anything 

60.27 61.15 A: no 

60.64 66.06 B: you y- y- y- you just end up paying yourself actually for that 

64.73 74.14 A: yeah it's not a living wage i mean it's you know uh i mean if if you're living with your parents or something it's fine but to actually live on your own i can't see how that would be enough 

74.31 75.74 B: yeah that's true 

75.25 77.39 A: yeah um 

78.21 79.08 A: okay 

80.05 83.53 B: so how much money you think the minimum wage should be 

83.57 85.87 A: i don't know um 

86.29 94.01 A: i have no idea i mean at least seven i i would guess i mean i can't imagine anyone really seven or eight at least 

94.15 98.01 B: i know that my companies they pay for internship for like um 

98.11 101.54 B: ten dollars or eleven dollars per per hour 

100.98 109.28 A: yeah i mean that seems that seems enough to to live on i mean maybe not live well but you know i think you 

102.23 103.74 B: up around 

108.19 114.32 B: mhm but what yeah but what the company can do about it actually they just uh 

109.31 111.43 A: you could scrape by on that 

114.33 118.14 B: they just want to keep the cost low and then and and they're trying to 

118.43 119.42 B: um 

120.40 130.45 B: i just think they're trying to keep the cost low and then trying to keep their all the kind of other other staff down then so basically they can they can't get more money out of it so 

129.03 137.98 A: yeah yeah i mean that's okay for an intern that's gonna be there for a few months and then leave but you know for for someone that's really gonna stick around i mean 

135.27 135.98 B: [noise] 

138.44 139.71 B: (( yeah that's true )) 

138.72 139.70 A: i don't know 

140.39 141.36 A: um 

141.92 143.61 A: yeah 

145.12 146.56 B: (( well )) 

147.23 148.64 A: and wh- 

147.24 148.77 B: (( [cough] um )) 

149.20 154.35 A: i think another thing you have to take into account is just the cost of living in different parts of the country i mean 

154.11 155.64 B: yeah that's true the 

154.82 156.63 A: some place like new york 

156.59 159.84 B: (( location yeah location's definitely going to factor into it )) 

157.52 160.60 A: yeah or california i mean maybe um 

160.63 164.88 A: maybe in a a rural location or something that might be enough money 

164.67 172.86 B: mhm even new york i don't think that a- a- a- actually in new york i think maybe twenty dollars or fifteen dollars [laughter] 

164.91 166.12 A: but 

171.27 174.13 A: yeah well i live in new york and i mean you know 

173.63 175.62 B: oh you live in new york 

174.52 176.39 A: yeah i'm [laughter] there right now and 

175.64 177.74 B: okay [laughter] 

176.67 183.17 A: but it would be nice if the minimum wage was at least that for everybody so but i don't see that happening any time soon so 

183.54 196.21 B: actually i i i i mean because you know actually i think um even in brazil i i i i think the minimum wage around like five seventy five or something or five fifty or something around that time around that ballpark 

194.28 195.05 A: uh-huh 

196.86 198.25 A: that's what it is now 

198.43 199.23 B: (( what )) 

198.96 200.72 A: that's what it is now or 

200.24 203.96 B: i think i think maybe i i i'm not really sure 

203.37 206.17 A: yeah well it's a federal thing isn't it 

206.18 210.95 B: yeah that's a federal thing and they do they ever increase that or 

210.61 212.36 A: do they increase it when 

212.11 216.06 B: um do they ever increase the minimum wage per year or just for 

215.15 220.39 A: i don't think it's per year i think it's just every so often they adjust it but 

218.46 219.50 B: uh-huh 

219.89 226.92 B: actually we're talking about inflation every year but the actually the minimum wage doesn't got increased every year i don- i don't think that's fair 

226.21 239.01 A: yeah well yeah i don't know i think they they announce every so often they're gonna increase it and like and a year from then they're gonna increase it as well and i don't know i remember the last time i made minimum wage i was you know 

238.63 240.52 B: mhm 

238.82 242.89 A: watching all those things very closely but i haven't done that for a while so 

243.36 249.59 B: yeah but actually i think a lot of impa- [noise] a lot of immigration workers are working on minimum wage though 

249.41 252.53 A: oh yeah yeah absolutely 

250.25 251.97 B: mhm 

252.92 253.70 A: (( uh )) 

252.99 262.96 B: um all kinds of stuff there they're working actually i learned i think around my my neighborhood i see all those kinda like um uh gardeners and then those [laughter] 

263.01 271.17 B: uh handymans actually not handyman actually the helper to to the handyman actually doing doing all the cool kind of stuff labor work 

264.35 265.53 A: (( migrant workers )) 

269.42 280.37 A: yeah well that's that's probably under the table too i remember when i lived in san francisco people would just stand on the side of the road and just wait for work and people would pick them up and it was pretty weird 

278.75 280.11 B: mhm 

281.22 282.26 B: yeah 

282.33 288.45 A: um and then i guess there's a separate minimum wage for restaurant workers for like waitresses and 

287.13 287.88 B: (( oh )) 

287.93 290.15 B: (( can you say that again like )) 

289.40 292.06 A: stuff there's a separate minimum wage for um 

292.27 294.63 A: like waiters and waitresses 

293.86 296.22 B: i don't know [laughter] 

294.92 297.60 A: there yeah there is 'cause they since they get tips 

296.50 300.87 B: i yeah i think they have i he- what i heard is something like uh 

301.00 303.84 B: two dollars for one hour 

302.05 303.53 A: yeah two something 

303.56 304.81 A: yeah 

304.15 310.61 B: they they they really don't live on their on the minimum wage actually they live on the tips i think 

309.88 314.04 A: yeah exactly but that's making two something an hour uh-huh 

310.97 312.03 B: uh-huh 

315.36 319.31 B: that's what i heard i have a friend who is actually a waitress 

319.50 326.00 B: and she's not really a real waitress she's just like a receptionist actually and she can get like around like 

323.75 324.44 A: (( yeah )) 

326.05 332.11 B: um for sometime very good she does nothing but just to leading people to to table or 

331.32 333.54 A: right right and they share the tips 

332.23 337.05 B: the cashier actually do do do those kinda stuff but different times i got tips 

334.98 335.81 A: yeah 

337.15 343.22 B: and every night he got he can o- o- on a better night he might get like forty dollars or thirty dollars 

342.45 343.90 A: yeah 

343.50 351.54 B: that's like uh five hours work or six hours work but still higher than the five dollars fifteen cents 

347.04 347.91 A: yeah 

351.29 356.18 A: right i think they they have a minimum wage that's like two something and then if they don't make 

356.76 362.65 A: if they don't if their tips don't make up for regular minimum wage then they they're supposed to get paid for it or something 

362.54 364.25 B: mhm 

362.79 365.53 A: i don't know but i guess everyone's tips make up for it so 

366.63 367.68 B: yep 

367.12 368.25 A: (( i don't know )) 

370.66 371.52 A: (( can ))

377.56 379.32 B: (( hm so the minimum wage now is )) 

378.54 380.99 A: (( seventy five five fifteen )) 

380.83 384.42 B: (( five fifteen is that right is i think )) 

383.14 384.99 A: (( yeah maybe i think )) 

384.57 388.35 B: ((  )) 

388.49 390.22 B: (( the last time i )) 

391.58 395.90 B: (( was making minimum wage it was four twenty five and then i think )) 

395.61 397.38 A: (( i think it must be because otherwise )) 

396.58 399.77 B: (( i think it did go up to four seventy five when )) 

399.66 403.15 A: (( they won't they won't let us know about it [laughter] i thought it was just raised a few )) 

403.53 404.70 B: (( i was making )) 

403.63 407.97 A: ((  )) 

407.42 412.64 B: minimum wage i i work i once worked when i was in college actually

444.71 447.65 B: it's just student union thing and uh 

447.90 449.87 B: it's um [cough]
