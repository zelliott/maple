22.32 29.51 A: well i got some good friends in webster groves and uh haven't been to st charles since i lived in kansas city over twenty years ago 

29.12 30.84 B: yep you drove through it 

30.70 33.71 A: uh [laughter] yeah went by [laughter] 

33.81 37.02 A: but the minimum wage that's a pretty interesting topic 

36.53 38.19 B: mhm 

37.56 42.17 A: i'm wondering what prompted their choice of that uh have have you done this before 

42.15 45.07 B: uh i've done a couple of 'em 

44.47 46.01 A: uh-huh same here 

46.59 49.71 A: what what's the minimum wage in uh missouri these days 

50.11 51.49 B: (( uh )) 

53.93 54.78 B: it's 

55.72 58.73 B: same as i guess the national wage i'm not sure what 

57.48 66.28 A: as the federal yeah 'cause washington state i think has the second highest we're like at six seventy five six eighty five something like that 

65.77 67.09 B: (( yeah i think it's uh )) 

66.14 76.57 A: and i used to live in massachusetts which historically has always had the highest minimum wage the state at i forget what on their law it's over seven dollars now though 

77.13 78.32 A: but uh 

78.56 80.10 A: in this economy 

80.62 90.79 A: uh we're currently washington state is currently second in the nation in unemployment and boosting the minimum wage won't do anything except probably 

91.19 94.07 A: you know lessen the number of jobs available spur 

94.54 104.45 A: lots i i don't know about your part of the world but out here there are lots of jobs way above entry level that pay barely over minimum wage you know seven and a half eight bucks an hour 

102.55 103.69 B: mhm 

104.94 107.06 B: yeah same here 

106.96 108.02 A: really 

107.46 109.36 B: (( uh and it's )) 

111.20 112.65 B: you know for the 

113.61 117.36 B: to me for the type of work that minimum wage 

118.02 123.81 B: jobs pay or that they required you know no skill 

125.44 129.41 B: basically temporary help for the most part 

130.47 131.35 B: uh 

132.02 133.57 B: (( i think it's too high where )) 

134.25 135.25 B: (( you get )) 

135.36 138.30 B: some of your small businesses and even you know 

139.15 141.34 B: (( restaurants are typically think of )) 

142.14 143.69 B: minimum wage jobs 

146.00 147.08 B: that that would 

148.57 154.98 B: kind of prohibit them from or cost them more money than they're worth cost the employers 

153.39 154.34 A: yeah 

158.90 161.51 B: to me sometimes more money than they're worth 

161.99 169.07 A: yeah i know business always lobbies against increases in the minimum wage for that reason and and uh 

169.19 183.65 A: in the current ah you know labor market they could there's been proposals in the past i know for for like a student wage or for you know a less than minimum wage for the kinds of things you're talking about part time no skill jobs 

182.35 184.83 B: yeah a part time wage 

185.03 185.73 B: (( i )) 

185.52 186.60 A: yeah 

186.09 188.41 B: (( i would be in favor like a part time wage )) 

188.25 198.15 A: but what happens then is that people for instance here we have lots of agriculture workers and without a minimum wage they'll literally truck in uh illegal 

198.18 202.41 A: aliens and pay 'em a buck a day if they can get away with it 

202.02 203.09 B: yeah 

202.52 206.66 A: um you know and housing 'em in substandard housing and uh 

206.88 213.09 A: the the thing that bothers me is that the bush administration is now 

213.42 214.56 A: um 

215.30 218.37 A: proposing i think it's still in proposal phase 

218.47 232.51 A: a law which would pretty much eliminnews personate uh overtime for a a wide variety of jobs so people who might be for instance uh an aircraft uh assembly person at a boeing plant here or out near st louis 

233.01 240.96 A: could be uh kept on the line if times get better but not be paid time and a half over forty hours 

241.23 243.43 A: and if that goes through 

244.00 248.33 A: then even somebody who's making you know let's say twenty bucks an hour 

248.60 263.10 A: uh where they would get thirty an hour for overtime that's not gonna happen anymore and i know in my past history um i worked in broadcasting for many years and they'd always couch you as a management person even if you were just an on air disk jockey 

262.98 263.76 A: (( or )) 

264.09 267.79 A: um so there never was time and a half overtime uh 

266.88 267.84 B: (( right )) 

267.87 270.29 A: and you know when i was 

270.30 277.06 A: living in kansas city in in the uh late seventies and was in radio most of the uh you know 

277.25 282.73 A: moon line uh broadcaster came more than sales came more than a sales job 

282.83 296.11 A: they paid maybe a buck over minimum wage an hour you know everybody thinks people in radio and t._v. make a lot of money but on the radio side anyway it [laughter] it was not much and the only thing i think would be good about increasing minimum wage 

296.16 298.60 A: would be for jobs like that where people 

298.90 299.97 A: (( [lipsmack] uh )) 

300.12 301.95 A: they don't get time and a half 

302.03 309.95 A: you know overtime but i can i can also see like you said small business particularly get hit by labor costs that's a major 

303.39 304.44 B: yeah 

310.59 312.44 A: you know their major budget item 

315.28 317.36 B: (( yeah i mean for the )) 

318.64 320.87 B: i haven't read or 

321.79 324.58 B: um heard a lot about that bill i heard 

325.58 332.69 B: you know the what i've heard is i guess the labor side that just says it's bad you 

332.62 334.02 A: right 

333.40 335.08 B: know i haven't heard uh 

337.95 338.85 B: (( what the )) 

339.50 343.56 B: actual provisions of the bill are i found some emphasis tha- 

344.73 348.59 B: it doesn't ap- it wouldn't apply as much to 

348.70 350.43 B: say like the boeing 

351.09 352.13 B: (( the )) 

352.19 353.29 B: union 

354.20 355.98 B: a lot of the union jobs 

355.90 357.36 A: right 

357.47 359.89 B: um but 

360.93 361.91 B: that was what 

361.08 366.45 A: i don't know i always i always think back to to my first paying job whi- which was as a paper boy 

366.42 379.00 A: and i was you know ten eleven years old and it was four dollars a week [laughter] you know and it was however long it took you to deliver your fifty papers that's the time you put in and it was four bucks a week flat rate but i think 

376.12 377.19 B: yeah 

379.28 390.11 A: i think uh in the current economy i i don't know if there's anything pending about another raise in the in- in the minimum wage federally i guess there's one slated to go into effect 

390.44 394.88 A: uh in two thousand and four maybe they've already done that but it's not 

393.55 394.61 B: (( yeah i heard that )) 

394.88 399.33 B: i think it was uh i guess a set increase 

400.20 401.12 B: or 

402.39 412.22 B: increase that from the last time they raised it that you know a few years it'd go up a little higher and still higher um 

405.38 406.43 A: right 

411.67 424.94 A: right over several years um but i don't see you know people uh working for ten or twelve bucks an hour if they increase the minimum wage it's not those jobs aren't going to get a 

425.36 431.92 A: you know an equivalent they're not gonna get an equivalent raise exactly and for people in that category who uh 

425.49 427.14 B: (( they're not gonna get a raise )) 

432.28 440.95 A: you know for instance i've seen jobs here that require master's degrees that are paying eighteen to twenty thousand dollars a year now that's ten bucks an hour 

440.82 441.89 B: right 

441.30 446.44 A: and the uh the current state of the economy you're not gonna [laughter] see those salaries go up mhm yeah 

445.89 447.37 B: yeah and even 

447.89 448.56 B: (( you )) 

449.15 455.12 B: know i have a bachelor's degree in psychology and the only thing i can do with that is maybe work on a psyche ward somewhere 

455.79 456.94 B: that pays you 

458.54 460.12 B: (( know twenty )) 

461.83 466.41 B: twenty thousand dollars or twenty to twenty five thousand dollars a a year around here 

466.94 469.22 B: and that's barely 

471.44 472.82 B: ten bucks an hour 

472.67 477.95 A: right i think it'd be interesting if they uh and of course companies 

477.98 479.19 A: like uh 

479.30 491.14 A: enron or tyco or uh worldcom don't have a lot of low wage jobs unless it's people in their telemarketing centers but it'd be interesting to tie 

491.30 493.87 A: um beginning wages to the 

493.72 507.73 A: uh salaries paid to the c._e._o.s [laughter] you know if if you're giving your your uh c._e._o. ten million dollars a year then you have to start everybody at ten dollars an hour or if you're giving him two million dollars a year 

508.00 510.57 A: you have to start 'em at two 

509.86 510.55 B: (( uh )) 

510.66 517.80 A: dollars an hour that would [laughter] be very interesting way to change the salary structures i don't think that'd happen 

517.95 518.81 B: no 

520.26 521.10 B: (( i guess )) 

521.70 523.01 B: you could um 

525.61 528.83 B: i know we get a cost of living allowance 

528.89 533.04 B: you know if they wanna raise it according to cost of living as 

533.42 539.84 B: the cost of living goes up you might raise the minimum wage on that uh 

538.34 539.36 A: (( right )) 

541.44 547.38 B: and not just an arbitrary you know in three years we're gonna raise it two dollars or a dollar or whatever 

548.85 549.95 B: (( but as )) 

550.02 552.17 B: you know the cost of 

554.41 556.79 B: living goes up you 

556.96 558.48 B: (( adjust the wage )) 

558.46 561.00 A: right and uh 

561.27 566.50 A: the other argument for something like that is in real terms 

566.70 575.68 A: incomes have gone down um you know middle class average salaries compared to thirty years ago are actually less 

575.61 585.05 A: and what increases there have been in the minimum wage compared to inflation over thirty years it's actually less so that's the other argument for increasing it 

588.98 592.90 B: yeah 

592.31 595.89 A: did you ever have a minimum wage job as a kid 

595.34 597.01 B: oh yeah i 

598.88 599.95 B: uh
