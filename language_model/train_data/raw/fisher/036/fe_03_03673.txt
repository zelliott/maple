0.35 2.21 B: hi my name is barb 

1.74 4.80 A: hi barb my name is [laughter] rachel how are ya 

4.30 5.85 B: i'm fine rachel 

5.52 6.62 A: (( good )) 

6.55 17.00 A: um [mn] i you know i have to say i just moved back from um moved back here from mexico after living in mexico for four years and i didn't even know what the min- minimum wage was so so 

13.23 14.09 B: uh-huh 

15.99 17.15 B: oh okay 

16.90 22.07 A: i had no idea 'cause it was the last time i heard was when i was high school and it was about three fifteen or something like that 

21.98 24.58 B: wow and so when were you in high school 

24.53 28.30 A: ah well in nineteen eighty seven i graduated from high school yeah 

26.35 35.28 B: oh okay all right yeah so i guess from nineteen eighty seven to two thousand and three that probably seems like a sufficient increase to you huh or did it not 

31.84 33.02 A: (( that just )) 

34.31 39.51 A: i don't know i don't think it seems i don't know [laughter] i don't i got to say five what did they say five do- five fifteen 

38.34 39.88 B: five fifteen uh-huh 

39.82 44.04 A: that's minimum wage so if you work a forty hour job that's two hundred dollars a week 

40.95 41.71 B: uh-huh 

43.67 44.50 B: uh-huh 

44.77 46.07 B: less taxes 

45.94 48.93 A: that does not sound like very much money to me 

49.97 51.87 A: (( that doesn't sound like very much money )) 

51.10 54.70 B: let's see it's five fifteen for eight hours 

54.48 62.26 A: well five fifteen times forty would be two hundred dollars but basically two hundred dollars a week times four would be like eight hundred dollars a month 

56.18 61.33 B: yeah times forty yeah so that would get it yeah yep that's it 

61.91 64.68 B: what do you do for a living michelle or or how mu 

63.55 71.38 A: i'm a i'm a stay at home mom i'm a homemaker and my husband makes you know way more than minimum wage and he 

65.67 66.91 B: (( okay [mn] )) 

70.48 72.45 B: thank goodness [laughter] 

71.53 77.22 A: with yeah thank goodness i know he makes way more than minimum wage and we're still always like where did the money go 

76.97 77.89 B: uh-huh 

77.46 91.84 A: so i don't know five fifteen doesn't sound like a whole lot of money to me so i would say yeah i'd say that an increase to five fifteen sounds pretty good in fact i think they ought to increase it a little more but that puts a lot of people that that puts a lot of strain on a lot of businesses especially small businesses 

86.48 87.29 B: right 

92.02 92.81 B: well 

92.09 92.65 A: (( [noise] )) 

92.85 96.52 B: [mn] that's true but you know i ah i am a small business owner and ah 

95.58 96.39 A: uh-huh 

96.63 102.51 B: ah i find that if i'm paying minimum wage i'm i'm i'm going to get minimum i'm going to get minimum work 

102.32 103.71 A: yeah [laughter] 

102.66 112.03 B: because they can flip burgers ah you know i'm not going to get the dedication i need so for um i guess that's just kind of like a ballpark starting point because 

104.58 105.92 A: yeah exactly 

106.57 107.41 A: yeah 

111.36 113.75 A: yeah what kind of business do you have 

112.09 112.89 B: um 

113.31 128.12 B: well i'm a legal nurse consultant and i do a lot of research and just educating the attorney on the medical side of cases but i also hire like clerical people to help um to just make copies and do different things and file and and answer phones and and ah 

121.45 122.80 A: yeah mhm 

125.17 125.99 A: (( right [noise] )) 

128.32 130.56 B: nobody wants to do it for five fifteen an hour 

130.26 132.61 A: (( nobody wants to do that for five fifteen an hour )) 

132.01 135.04 B: so no they don't want to do research and so 

134.42 136.19 A: and you want somebody full time 

135.94 144.04 B: well no no i'm happy with just you know i'm happy with just supplemental because i'm really not you know i i i manage a office out of my home you know and i 

136.97 138.06 A: no not even 

141.07 142.71 A: you can do some of it 

144.01 151.81 B: i do a lot but every once in a while i get swamped maybe like this last week when i had like twenty cases come in at one time and so i needed somebody to just catagor- you know get 'em in here 

151.67 165.19 B: log 'em in s- get 'em in in in the right order to which one needs to go back out first and you know just take care of ancillary things answer the phones so i can do the research or help with the research ah some of the issues are really easy to do but no one really wants to do it 

154.45 155.77 A: (( right [mn] )) 

162.94 168.16 A: and so if somebody who can make five fifteen is like somebody's who's qualified to flip burgers like you said 

167.56 180.55 B: yeah right and so that they would rather do that so that they have the i- it's more of a fun job you know it's more they're seeing people and the time goes faster instead of using their brain they don't eat nobody wants to use their brain for five fifteen an hour so that's what you run against 

172.92 175.02 A: [laughter] mor- more brainless 

178.67 184.05 A: so how well that's like so for a job like that like wh- h- what do you pay people six dollars an hour 

182.71 184.51 B: oh seven seven ten 

184.43 185.58 A: seven ten 

185.15 191.99 B: mhm but there are no benefits now see that that that's what factors in but then see a lot of your minimum wage jobs anymore now 

185.88 187.10 A: yet 

187.64 188.64 A: right 

191.78 200.59 B: that's what they're doing it's twenty to thirty hours and you have to work two of 'em and you still don't get any benefits and you're really in trouble or that's the way it is here in kentucky i don't know where you are but 

199.39 213.35 A: oh yeah i'm in north carolina but like i said i just moved back here so i'm really i mean the whole minimum wage thing but i know that a lot of places um ah you know they keep they they keep more part time employees so that they don't have to pay benefits because it's really expensive to pay benefits 

203.03 203.94 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

210.99 212.39 B: right 

212.73 219.83 B: that's correct so they'll hire two people and and s- you know split shifts and and and it's horrible 'cause you are 

214.78 215.79 A: right 

217.43 230.44 A: right well how i mean how if you're tell me how if you're making minimum wage if you're making two hundred and something dollars a week minus taxes how in god's name are you supposed to pay health insurance and 

225.19 226.52 B: mhm right 

229.78 239.64 B: it's very difficult that's i guess that's why ah i don't i like i would like to see them either raise the minimum wage a little bit more or force the companies to actually 

236.64 237.60 A: yeah 

239.41 242.33 A: offer benefits for part time employees mhm 

240.57 252.62 B: offer well either either that either offer it or force them to to you know they have allowed because the laws are so liberal the the sm- business owners can do what they want to do so therefore 

252.55 266.98 B: they do hire two twenty hour in instead of one forty hour so if they're not going to order actual benefits then i think they should go through and say well wait a minute you've got like all of these part time people unless you can give us some justification for it then you either need to pay those part time people more 

254.91 255.94 A: yeah 

262.45 263.37 A: right 

267.06 269.59 A: yeah offer them benefits 

267.48 275.49 B: or you need to offer them benefits because that's you- you're right i mean it's really hard and now in in especially if you've got even a even a single 

275.51 279.30 B: you know a single parent it's difficult to make it a single 

276.68 277.78 A: yeah 

278.56 281.55 A: even if you're not a single parent even if you're a single person 

279.87 289.33 B: well even if you're not parent if it's just a couple or a single person that's right it's forcing our country to go i'm seeing more and more of kids going back and living with their parents or or living you know 

287.32 288.35 A: right 

289.21 292.91 A: after like well after high school or not even leaving the house 

290.05 290.83 B: yeah 

290.86 299.18 B: down the street or yeah right there's more and more of that and getting back to the old days when everybody lived on the farm [laughter] because they can't afford not to 

296.86 297.80 A: right [laughter] 

298.84 306.00 A: right exactly no gosh i don't know how people can live on minimum wage thank god i mean don't you you just say thank god you haven't 

299.41 301.42 B: um and 

303.06 304.33 B: it's tough i 

304.57 307.59 B: it's been a while since i've had to and i don't think i could 

307.10 309.25 A: i know thank god you have an education 

308.86 323.85 B: right well see and that's part of it if because if you're working minimum wage it's really hard to pay for your education or pay for childcare to get your education so that you can make more so i think that you know i i guess it's just me but [mn] even a small business owner i know that i have to pay more to get what i want 

313.45 314.45 A: (( [mn] )) 

314.89 316.59 A: yeah exactly 

322.77 324.79 A: right right exactly uh-huh 

323.99 327.01 B: and to me it's better in the long run because i 

327.40 340.12 B: i think the lower when you've got that these people are so stressed there's more crime there's more there's more suicide there's more drugs because what have they got to look forward to they're busting their buns and they never really get anywhere 

331.04 332.07 A: yeah 

332.58 333.53 A: yeah 

333.87 335.00 A: yeah 

336.72 338.15 A: (( i know )) 

338.40 343.95 A: well was there someone for example like if someone's working in ah target are they making five fifteen an hour 

343.40 344.40 B: yes ma'am 

344.97 355.13 B: yes ma'am and that's why i get so aggravated when i go out and i see people being so rude to the cashiers of course some of the cashiers are rude i'll admit some of them are rude but then i keep i always in the back of my mind i keep saying 

345.32 346.61 A: (( god i mean i don't know )) 

350.74 352.91 A: yeah yeah exactly [laughter] [mn] 

355.18 363.75 B: they're doing this because that's all they can do if they could do something different they would be so it's kind of like you know you don't you know you're like not rude to mentally 

357.49 360.00 A: ex- exactly that's it's this or nothing 

363.72 370.34 B: deficit people or or or older people or babies you know so you don't be rude to cashiers either because if they could be doing something else they would 

364.67 365.67 A: yeah 

365.89 366.91 A: yeah 

368.43 369.46 A: yeah 

370.07 372.85 A: yeah exac- that's exactly right but it's 

370.98 384.98 B: you know and they're stuck in this rat race and th- you know i've got some really good friends who do this and it's not that they're lesser people i love 'em it's just that they're stuck in this rat race because of a divorce or this or that or what have you or getting pregnant early or and they can't get out of it because they're 

373.78 375.82 A: it is a total rat race 

377.20 378.19 A: yeah 

380.74 381.71 A: right 

385.21 395.69 B: there's not you know if they have a job they can't get government money to to help with their education and they don't have time to go back and get more of an education because they're having to work two part time jobs 

385.71 388.84 A: because there's no way it's a vicious ci- it's a vicious cycle 

389.30 390.17 A: right 

395.12 396.42 A: that's right 

395.83 397.88 B: to make ends meet and their children 

396.86 399.69 A: now are you democrat 'cause you sound like a democrat 

399.23 403.14 B: oh really now do i really that's hilarious now why do you say that 

400.28 401.77 A: [laughter] yeah 

402.33 404.30 A: well because you well 

404.06 412.68 A: because i usually think of um [lipsmack] i don't know 'cause i usually think of republicans as like pull yourself up by your boot straps you know don't don't look to us for help 

412.44 424.24 A: you know we can't really y- you know you guys got to get yoursel- you got to get your act together but and i don't really i don't really hear most ah republicans having a lot of compassion for people who are stuck in that vicious cycle that you're talking about 

416.39 417.22 B: yeah 

423.50 438.31 B: how funny while i guess um i guess the giveaway there i am a democrat just now that since you know but actually my major flaw is the fact that i'm a nurse and nurses are usually very compassionate and because of being a nurse i see all walks of people i deal with the attorneys with the lexus 

431.31 432.33 A: [laughter] 

432.62 433.90 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

436.05 440.43 A: i'm sure you do you work at but you don't work in a hospital you work in yeah 

438.86 442.79 B: no no i did oh god um over twenty years um 

442.03 448.78 A: well there you must see a lot of people who you know are making minimum wage and can't afford good healthcare so they come in through the emergency room door 

446.44 447.80 B: right 

448.33 454.41 B: oh yeah i mean i've seen 'em come in and and you know it's like you people ah and i've seen my coworkers who were doctors driving lexus' 

454.35 461.73 B: be down on them like oh they haven't had a bath in a week well you know when i go to their home to do their home health or to visit them or to check on them 

461.52 470.57 B: you find out well there's no running water and you know there's eight people living in one house trailer and you know and ever- an- and you got three people working minimum wage 

463.49 465.08 A: (( yeah oh i know )) 

466.70 467.75 A: (( i know )) 

469.40 471.97 A: (( i know i know yeah )) 

470.60 484.26 B: and they're doing good to keep you know the elect- sometimes there's three trailers and you know there's one electri- one person has electricity and there's and the other person has a phone and they share you know like they run extension cords and the children are not getting proper care and you know they 

478.20 479.09 A: yeah 

479.84 481.21 A: yeah yeah yeah 

481.24 482.01 A: (( yeah )) 

483.37 486.81 A: i know it's so sad isn't it now minimum wage is 

485.76 487.74 B: and that's what it irritates me at 

486.85 496.50 A: it makes you it makes you look at other societies who have like you know like more specialistic systems and go okay now those people have they're you know that's what we should be doing around here but 

491.26 492.30 B: mhm 

495.88 502.31 B: but well the sad part is is what america does is we take care of those people in other countries and we let our people starve you know 

500.06 501.25 A: yeah 

501.55 502.67 A: yeah [laughter]

563.32 564.17 B: right 

565.18 565.97 B: right
