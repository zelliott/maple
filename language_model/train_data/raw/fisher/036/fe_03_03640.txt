4.60 7.00 B: uh hi um 

6.07 6.86 A: (( how're you )) 

7.61 9.06 B: (( [noise] what )) 

8.50 9.25 A: hi 

9.59 12.65 B: sorry was the topic was if we're affected by it 

12.77 16.25 A: i think it was whether we think it's sufficient no i don't remember 

16.22 17.51 B: uh 

17.14 21.80 A: we could answer both eh ten we have ten minutes so [laughter] 

19.93 21.33 B: yeah um 

21.46 25.72 B: yeah i think uh from [laughter] from what to five fifteen 

26.59 31.37 A: i i don't think he just said it went to five fifteen which i thought i think it's higher than that now actually 

28.94 29.74 B: (( oh )) 

30.58 40.52 B: well it depends on where you are i know that in like fresno it's uh or in parts of california it's i think eight dollars eight fifty or something like that yeah 

32.41 33.15 A: right 

38.95 45.57 A: real- and i is seven dollars but i i think texas is like two dollars so i think but i if federal government supersedes 

46.01 47.27 A: the state 

46.95 48.64 B: okay um 

49.10 59.07 B: so whether or not it's sufficient uh i mean there's all sorts of issues there with uh minimum wage laws i mean they say if i mean ac- actually no i remember [noise] the question in california there's this uh 

58.87 67.91 B: [noise] in san francisco like a the minimum wage was raised to eight fifty or something and uh i mean but one of the huge effects was that a lot of the 

63.21 64.07 A: really 

67.84 75.97 B: neighboring well lot of the industry in san francisco just outsourced a lot of um jobs to neighboring areas 

75.86 84.86 B: which is i mean really bad for san francisco because they did lose a lot of their high paying jobs in like the recent dot com bust so that is something that i mean it's you know 

85.19 88.58 B: [noise] hard to say if it's good or bad but um 

87.21 92.18 A: yeah well it's probably good for me if i'm gonna be moving out there soon so housing prices probably have come down [laughter] 

92.02 100.14 B: yeah that's true um yeah actually sorry my friend just bought an apartment there and yeah says it's definitely good timing right now 

94.47 95.32 A: yeah i mean 

100.22 113.03 A: really uh that's good to know yeah i mean you know i think you're talking five fifteen on a nationwide level i mean it might be appropriate in some place like iowa or somewhere like that but you know in a large metropolitan area do you figure if somebody works forty hours a week at five fifteen 

101.02 101.77 B: (( yeah )) 

110.20 110.90 B: (( [noise] )) 

110.93 113.27 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

113.24 116.78 A: is making about two hundred and twenty dollars a week 

115.62 117.79 B: (( mhm mhm [noise] )) 

117.04 119.41 A: (( i mean it's really not you know )) 

118.55 119.52 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

119.81 122.25 A: i don't pay rent in san francisco 

121.69 123.52 B: [noise] no i don't think so 

122.52 124.40 A: for ha- for half a month you know 

124.49 127.69 A: from that regard it's probably little bit too low 

124.52 125.30 B: (( [noise] nope [noise] )) 

127.80 128.62 B: (( uh-huh )) 

129.10 130.28 B: but i mean 

129.24 131.47 A: but at the same time there's the jobs 

131.22 132.21 B: yeah [noise] 

132.94 134.11 B: 'cause i mean some peop- 

133.98 139.21 B: uh i mean there's also the question of you know sufficient for who you know like some people 

139.18 150.84 B: you know work a job supplement a- another income well i mean not necessarily for that but i mean like part i'm thinking of you know students who work part time and stuff like that things like that so it's hard to say 

147.52 148.67 A: right 

151.23 152.35 B: um 

151.78 155.62 A: yeah i mean also maybe the market doesn't really you know maybe they're doing 

155.94 159.46 A: french fry making at mcdonald's and that's really wh- all the market's willing to pay 

156.08 157.10 B: mhm 

159.17 160.98 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

160.38 162.35 A: in that regard it's sorta interesting 

162.48 165.80 A: quandary as to whether it's really appropriate for them 

165.21 166.81 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

167.17 168.72 B: (( [lipsmack] um [lipsmack] )) 

169.94 171.09 B: what else 

172.70 177.40 A: [laughter] i don't know i mean it's a lot of time to talk about a very narrow topic 

176.94 178.65 B: yeah 

177.90 179.51 A: which is sort of itching 

179.97 186.43 A: but i i i found out the actual reason why they're doing this [noise] it's for um speech recognition soft- software is what they're trying to figure out 

180.01 180.95 B: (( mm )) 

186.40 188.74 B: oh yeah i really [noise] 

187.09 188.38 A: or speech patter 

189.05 197.06 B: yeah i was wondering about that in the 'cause like the last guy i did one before and the guy like had a really accent so i'd be curious about that 

190.98 191.69 A: (( [noise] )) 

197.77 203.38 A: yeah and th- it's the actual users behind it i actually called and a girl started talking to me for like twenty minutes 

203.52 216.93 A: and she was tell me the girl who who answered the phone when i called to ask a question kept talking for like twenty minutes and she was like rec- they're trying to develop speech recognition software patterns and things like that and understand sort of you know how to better do that 

203.68 204.48 B: huh 

208.62 210.51 B: (( oh yeah [noise] )) 

216.41 219.41 B: well we're probably messing it up then [laughter] 

218.61 222.12 A: no i mean i think we're just talking i think it's more their trying to 

220.67 226.60 B: oh oh okay i thought it meant it would try to l- locate the topic you know based upon what people said [noise] oh 

225.52 230.14 A: no i think it's more just like i'm getting like the software to like recognize human voice better 

230.39 233.14 B: oh and that's fine i don't feel bad then [laughter] 

232.38 235.69 A: no [laughter] which is sorta interesting 

233.19 234.84 B: um [noise] 

235.57 237.34 B: yeah uh 

236.41 239.66 A: i mean it is it's a really narrow topic 

239.58 241.33 B: yeah um 

241.98 244.53 B: but i did one before and it was on uh 

246.58 248.74 B: [lipsmack] uh it was on um 

249.42 251.38 B: like life partners or something hello 

251.31 252.53 A: yep 

252.36 257.18 B: okay i couldn't hear some- so i thought that you got cut off it's a pretty good deal though 

254.19 254.87 A: (( oh )) 

255.65 256.43 A: (( no )) 

257.35 260.64 A: (( yeah no it is life partners yeah i did one the other day that was on pets )) 

260.83 262.00 B: oh that's pretty good 

260.94 266.30 A: which was thrilling yeah w- the woman i was talking to had like eight birds and a cat 

262.71 263.96 B: yeah 

266.96 268.71 B: okay [laughter] 

267.27 275.31 A: [laughter] i was like oh that's very fitting she was telling me how she lets her birds out and stuff like that i was like well it's thrilling stuff 

269.39 270.13 B: yeah 

272.16 274.00 B: (( mhm )) 

275.60 282.27 A: yeah no they're actually not bad i mean minimum wage let's see what else yeah it really has never affected me i mean 

275.66 276.70 B: yep yep 

281.58 283.41 B: it's a i guess it's interesting 

283.43 288.78 B: here because i mean [laughter] these uh speech things we're making way more than that 

288.50 292.00 A: [laughter] that's actually an interesting point 

288.93 291.24 B: [laughter] i mean this is to 

291.45 294.27 B: me that's a viable job market thing 

293.89 297.53 A: yeah no i mean it's a shame you can only do three of these otherwise you know sign me up for 

296.20 297.53 B: (( yeah )) 

297.54 298.87 A: every day you know 

298.32 300.24 B: yeah i know you'd be making what 

299.31 304.22 A: you'd be enough well they said they use twelve thousand people or more by the end of the summer 

304.50 305.34 B: (( oh yeah )) 

305.23 307.77 A: (( yeah i )) 

306.22 312.82 B: and i i saw posted something new like more male voices or something that i guess they had a lot of female voices already maybe 

312.14 315.05 A: yes she said that they needed more mostly males now 

315.05 316.27 B: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

316.01 317.35 A: which is sorta interesting 

316.30 317.30 B: cool 

317.47 318.33 B: (( mhm )) 

317.79 320.28 A: yeah no it works how did you hear about this stuff 

320.34 329.21 B: uh there's a message board online at wallet dot com they do all they they list all sorts of like deals and like uh you know any sort of thing like this so 

329.02 334.07 A: yeah no i've heard of it yeah a friend told me he saw it on craig list so i checked it out 

329.31 330.39 B: that's cool 

333.80 336.54 B: mm okay wa- so where are you where do you live 

336.50 337.61 A: right near boston 

337.64 341.03 B: oh okay i thought craig hills was bay area

343.81 351.31 B: oh i didn't realize i didn't realize they other place 'cause i'm in new york right now but there's this uh craigs list for um 

351.85 352.41 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

352.77 356.69 B: there's this craigs list for san francisco that like i know most of my friends use so 

356.59 361.11 A: right now i think that that was the first one and i think it's expanded out to other cities also 

361.05 361.97 B: oh 

362.18 369.63 A: which is interesting but h- he saw it posted there and he asked me whether he whether i thought it was legit and i'm like well you know i'll try and find out [noise] 

369.25 372.02 B: well the reason why i i mean 'cause there's there 

371.88 386.54 B: must be all the time it's just like you know people post like if there's you know usually like online deals and stuff like that but they also post like things like this and like you know most of the people there you know had said they'd done it before and i figured they couldn't all be you know [laughter] on the toke so i figured anyone else 

382.33 383.09 A: yeah 

386.72 389.82 A: hey even if it is you know it's thirty minutes of your time 

389.53 391.16 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

390.49 392.25 A: so which is really not that

547.40 555.58 B: i don't know it's like we there's a lot of like confusion over language and stuff like that so that was most of the conversation actually [laughter] 

554.83 564.28 A: yeah i i mean imag- um the one i had on pets you know the woman was like eighty seven years old i can imagine having that kind of conversation with her she's like somebody that's gonna be alive for the next five years
