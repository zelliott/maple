0.10 2.00 A: hi my name's ava 

1.78 3.35 B: (( hi i'm kat )) 

3.33 4.67 A: hi nice to meet you 

4.78 9.68 B: nice to meet you did she say five dollars and fifteen cents or fifty cents 

5.59 6.47 A: (( mhm )) 

7.92 9.26 A: yeah what did it 

9.71 11.74 A: i think it was fifteen 

12.06 13.81 A: what did it used to be 

14.06 15.00 A: do you know 

14.45 16.41 B: well it was four fifty 

16.21 17.20 A: okay 

16.87 20.26 B: i thought it'd already been raised again it could have just been 

20.44 21.45 A: yeah 

20.82 21.90 B: like the 

22.16 29.12 B: standard other than d._c. so that would not even be a living wage if you worked full time and over time 

26.77 27.92 A: (( it yeah )) 

28.66 36.20 A: mhm and that's actually kind of neat that you're in d._c. and i'm in wisconsin so that's like up here everything's really cheap 

36.28 39.99 A: um so i mean that maybe i mean 

36.44 37.64 B: yeah 

40.28 43.40 A: i think for a high school or something that's good but 

43.43 47.54 A: for a working adult i think you know that's not good [laughter] 

47.20 48.83 B: (( yeah it is )) 

47.67 51.39 A: it would be hard to pay rent and make all the bills with that kind of a wage 

51.20 54.81 B: let alone if you had any dependents i can't even imagine 

54.53 68.24 A: yeah yeah i know i think when i was in high school i was making minimum wage and i think back then maybe i was making a little above minimum wage and it you know still it was like just perfect for me in high school i think i was making like six something 

68.53 70.22 A: so i mean 

70.71 72.33 A: (( that was even you know )) 

70.88 72.10 B: (( yeah i mean )) 

72.39 76.60 B: most places if they want good help they're going to have to pay more anyway 

76.24 77.76 A: yeah yeah 

77.56 91.49 B: by what minimum wage is just because the demand is so high like i know mcdonalds pays a lot an hour like they start you at six an hour because it's so hard to keep people in that job because it's a horrible job no one wants to do it 

86.14 87.29 A: oh really 

90.79 99.49 A: yeah and i think my little brother was telling me like the dollar store makes like eight an hour or [laughter] something i'm like oh that's cool you know minimum wage is 

98.11 98.95 B: yeah 

99.51 101.44 A: so low i 

102.10 107.84 A: i don't know i would think that that would you know i think personally it should be higher because 

108.72 112.04 A: for an hour's work i mean that's pretty damn cheap 

112.35 118.96 B: yeah any more you you really couldn't get a box of cereal for that you know you get the cereal but no milk or 

112.48 113.60 A: personally 

115.93 116.87 A: no 

118.64 121.68 A: yeah yeah that's hard 

120.34 128.06 B: not good and i mean i used to live in missouri in a small town in missouri and you know rent was like a hundred fifty a month 

124.66 125.56 A: mhm 

127.69 129.11 A: i know isn't 

128.19 129.98 B: (( or a hundred to pay a month and )) 

129.43 134.11 A: yeah is the minimum wage um is that the same all throughout the u._s. 

134.51 135.70 A: it must be 

134.62 136.74 B: it is but um 

136.89 138.57 B: i think so anyway 

138.14 140.44 A: i think ah that that don't seem right you know 

140.42 146.71 B: i thought that missouri had raised their's as a state but i think minimum wage is like a federal law 

146.74 155.55 A: mm 'cause that that don't seem right 'cause like you said you live in washington and i live in wisconsin and i think the pr- price differences for 

155.61 157.03 A: you know even 

157.12 162.45 B: oh yeah a few years' ago if you shared a house with four people you're still paying seven fifty a month in rent 

157.39 158.80 A: loans or 

162.31 165.46 A: yeah and i'm actually i live in a 

165.52 168.31 A: a big size like the top of a house one room 

168.50 173.72 A: the rent's i'm sorry one bedroom apartment type thing and we pay two eighty a month 

173.82 177.32 B: yeah the the problem though is like smaller businesses 

177.18 178.04 A: mhm 

178.20 180.06 B: have a really hard time 

180.07 185.43 B: making up the difference like i was working in a restaurant so i was still in college when they raised it last time 

185.09 185.99 A: uh-huh 

185.91 189.36 B: and i remember all the prices had to go up 

188.38 189.29 A: yeah 

189.43 194.81 B: because it cost him more and then when they were talking about um mandating carrying health insurance 

189.74 190.41 A: (( yeah )) 

194.72 195.69 A: mhm 

195.83 202.03 B: for jobs you know in like the food service industry or whatever and he was like oh we'd go bankrupt there was no way i could cover it 

201.89 203.21 A: yeah 

202.48 205.97 B: a few cents i don't think is that you know i mean even if it was 

206.77 208.12 B: five fifty 

208.09 209.04 A: mhm 

208.30 210.31 B: instead of like five ninety 

210.14 213.82 A: i just can't imagine making that much now [laughter] you know 

211.30 212.97 B: it's not that outrageous 

213.81 214.84 B: yeah 

214.32 217.21 A: i don't know and i think if you're 

217.61 219.02 A: if you're an adult 

219.88 221.63 A: [noise] i think um 

221.66 231.37 A: i think it would be like impossible to just make that much i mean to get by on just that much you know i th- i think for like high school students and whatnot i think that's an okay price 

231.40 239.22 A: because they're still living at home but i i don't know i think once you're independent and on your own it it would be too difficult to make and need 

239.22 246.13 B: yeah yeah but i mean the problem is is like i actually work with a lot of poverty groups and you 

245.70 246.56 A: mhm 

246.21 250.16 B: know we deal with a lot of immigrants and you know 

250.49 256.82 B: prisoners that's that's if there is a criminal record and they just have such a hard time with no education and 

251.69 252.85 A: yeah 

256.22 257.47 A: yeah 

256.86 260.39 B: now that they are adults trying to raise a family on minimum wage right 

259.82 260.77 A: yeah 

261.19 263.41 A: yeah i think it should be increased 

263.47 264.78 A: like at least 

264.79 276.05 A: you know like i think five fifty would at least be better you know um especially for those people like that and i know the other thing is i know here they have like some 

276.06 279.97 A: like drive drive through or drive in restaurants like the 

280.93 284.41 A: what do you call it where you drive up and they come to your window and bring you food 

284.17 285.41 B: mhm 

284.84 286.19 A: and um 

286.06 288.31 B: they can pay you less for that 

287.76 293.88 A: yeah and they were making like three something an hour and then plus tips and i think that's 

291.59 292.75 B: (( oh yeah it's if )) 

292.79 295.23 B: you work as a waiter your 

295.24 298.81 B: minimum wage is like a dollar twenty five i think an hour 

298.04 299.91 A: yeah that's crazy 

299.08 306.08 B: 'cause you're expected to make up for it in tips which may or may not happen but you're also being taxed on your tips 

301.48 302.87 A: yeah 

306.00 313.84 A: yeah and i know my friend he used to cook in the back and they paid her the same thinking somehow she was going to get tips you know 

313.76 314.79 B: yeah 

313.87 316.05 A: and that's ridiculous i don't know 

315.65 320.85 B: yeah i feel bad for waiters and waitresses because they have to tip the bartender and the bus boys out 

320.78 321.79 A: mhm 

321.15 330.16 B: and taxes out of that and they're only making a dollar twenty five an hour so if someone's or someone's at at a table for hours having coffee and talking 

322.51 323.32 A: yeah 

328.21 329.14 A: mhm 

330.04 330.89 A: yeah 

330.21 333.53 B: they're not going to make enough tips to have even made minimum [laughter] wage 

333.12 334.63 A: yeah but 

333.75 334.50 B: (( unless )) 

334.98 336.27 B: wage right 

336.37 338.41 A: yeah that that's crazy 

338.57 344.11 A: i don't know um i think that's why schooling is so important nowadays [laughter] you know 

343.36 344.12 B: yeah 

344.34 345.68 A: i i just 

345.46 348.36 B: although anymore like even the entry level jobs 

348.70 352.11 B: that i'm looking at in my field all require phds 

351.91 353.10 A: oh really 

352.74 354.99 B: 'cause you know and unemployment's 

355.16 359.41 B: so hard well finding a job is so hard 

358.87 362.65 A: yeah and now that everybody a lot of people are looking for jobs and 

361.99 367.01 B: right and everyone's educated now like so many more people are just getting degrees and 

364.77 369.17 A: well the qualifications are going to be way up yeah that's the 

367.37 372.82 B: yeah and you know when the economy started going bad a lot of people just said well 

372.87 377.95 B: i'll just go in grad school and you know it's barely an edge to have your phd 

375.20 376.08 A: mhm 

377.42 384.37 A: mhm i know luckily i i did some technical college you know and i didn't get a degree or anything but 

384.65 388.05 A: [mn] i started out in like in the company i'm in 

388.07 399.65 A: really low i think i started out like eight dollars an hour and i've just been working my way up and that's that's been good if you can get into a company like that but i don't know a lot of people can't so 

397.30 397.86 B: (( mm )) 

399.85 401.72 A: education's very important 

400.03 401.85 B: yeah 

402.26 403.67 B: definitely 

403.09 414.88 A: it's hard you know 'cause a lot of people say either three years' experience or a degree in this field you know and how are you supposed to get that experience if you don't you know get get a chance to do it 

409.46 410.58 B: right 

412.78 413.91 B: right 

414.19 420.79 B: and how do you how can you pay for that degree and um if you already have a job that'll pay you [laughter] you know it does seem a lot of money yeah 

417.49 418.41 A: yeah 

418.86 427.17 A: well you just about have to start like when you're still in your parents' house just about you know start going to college or 

427.94 435.41 A: technical school or something 'cause it's too hard i think to work and try to get a degree and especially on on minimum wage 

433.50 439.17 B: yeah but i mean i had to there wasn't a choice like even with a scholarship i didn't make enough money 

438.78 439.90 A: yeah 

439.57 440.90 B: (( you know so )) 

440.93 442.65 A: especially on minimum wage huh 

441.20 446.70 B: it was really hard so minimum wage was important to me at that point because that was you know 

446.63 447.83 A: mhm 

447.27 454.66 B: 'cause going to voluntarily give you a raise but i'm trying to do school full time and that that is pretty rotten 

450.02 450.97 A: yeah 

454.88 461.82 A: yeah i know around here i don't think many places pay the minimum wage like i think they pay above the minimum wage 

461.56 465.52 B: right well do you see they would have to just to be able to keep you 

462.50 463.45 A: so 

465.40 466.49 A: yeah 

465.78 472.44 B: [laughter] there and plus like a lot of the janitorial office services are labor unions 

466.58 467.48 A: yeah 

471.83 473.05 A: (( mm mhm )) 

473.09 476.31 B: so they're protected but i know in other towns like 

473.37 474.61 A: well they have people 

476.73 482.01 B: that was the worst job you could get because they would just pay you the bare minimum no health insurance 

481.95 483.05 A: mhm 

482.37 486.54 B: you had to work crazy hours like the janitors would be cleaning the campus 

486.70 489.67 B: at two and three in the morning because that's when they could get in 

490.63 494.57 A: yeah yeah so so what do you think do you think the minimum wage should be raised 

490.65 491.77 B: to do it 

494.46 496.41 B: (( i definitely think it should be raised )) 

495.90 497.94 A: (( and what do you think it should be raised to )) 

499.55 500.94 B: (( i'd say )) 

501.32 502.96 B: five sixty 

502.55 506.13 A: yeah i would say between five fifty and six 

506.57 508.98 A: i think um and 

507.46 508.37 B: yeah 

509.41 512.57 B: six i think would be hard to get people to go for 

512.19 513.17 A: what's that 

513.23 519.96 B: i think six would be hard to get people to go for because they threw a huge stink last time about that 

520.00 522.67 B: a forty [laughter] raise or something 

521.99 529.06 A: oh yeah yeah um i mean j- if i was making the laws [laughter] that's what i'd do but um 

526.14 526.89 B: yeah 

529.72 535.66 A: i don't know but then there's a lot of businesses just barely getting by too and i suppose it's hard to find help and 

535.02 538.67 B: right but i mean i don't think that it's that extreme 

539.39 540.72 B: in terms of 

540.91 541.81 B: (( you know )) 

542.10 546.65 B: under six dollars you're still looking at maybe fifty cents more an hour you know 

546.58 548.32 A: yeah and 

548.10 553.03 B: which is going to work out to maybe twelve more bucks a week or you know depending on how much stuff 

552.65 559.32 A: yeah let's say you get a ten cent raise for each employee if they work the forty hour week it's only going to be four dollars 

559.08 562.39 B: yeah of course if they would just restructure the tax 

559.56 560.88 A: you know different 

562.47 564.32 B: [laughter] but um 

562.96 564.37 A: yeah there we go 

564.55 570.23 B: then that would save a lot more money and actually tax a little bit more appropriately according to income 

570.00 573.50 A: yeah yeah and i just think i think it's 

573.78 577.40 A: like i was saying before i just think it's weird that i think each 

577.52 579.72 A: (( state just about or )) 

579.75 584.24 A: i don't know it's it's hard to come up with a minimum wage for the whole u._s. you know 

583.74 586.15 B: right it is extremely it's 

584.30 586.83 A: because there's so many different 

587.51 589.00 A: different um 

589.61 590.99 A: what am i trying to say i 

591.71 593.58 A: can't think of the word i'm thinking of but 

593.82 595.34 A: you know because there's 

594.63 599.89 B: such a regional thing like if ah you have a hundred dollars in one area it's not going to spend 

595.93 596.98 A: yeah
