2.67 4.47 A: hello matt my name's a._j. 

4.46 5.98 B: hi a._j. how are you 

5.91 8.45 A: i'm doing fine yourself 

7.22 9.19 B: i'm doing well 

8.83 10.31 A: that's good 

10.38 18.24 A: well this is an interesting top we got they seem to ramble on a bit 

12.63 14.92 B: [laughter] yeah i bet it is 

15.45 19.97 B: [laughter] ah yeah um well where shall we start [laughter] 

19.83 23.44 A: (( um i mean has the i )) 

23.40 37.07 A: can't even do the voice [laughter] um has corporate scandals affected the economy [laughter] i guess start with the larger and what and then what could be done is i guess what they're trying to figure out what we in the street think 

29.19 30.26 B: yeah 

37.11 41.69 B: yeah okay yeah and what then what the government can do about it or whatever right 

37.27 38.48 A: um 

40.84 46.28 A: yeah yeah i mean as a having lots of fun being an employed 

41.78 42.68 B: okay 

46.34 58.63 A: um person right now i do know that it hasn't made anything easier with the ups and downs that the economy has gone through because companies seem to be a bit gun shy especially you know 

57.69 58.96 B: right 

58.57 65.26 A: with the overall effect that these scandals have on the economy not that individual companies are but that you know 

65.32 72.47 A: companies you know the economy is just sort of like um are we gonna have to lose another few billion dollars because someone lied again 

71.79 73.19 B: yeah 

73.21 76.90 A: so i mean it's affected me in general um 

76.13 84.23 B: yeah i- i'm in a similar ah situation i mean luckily i've got just some contract part time work but um 

84.32 90.57 B: yeah i mean my take on the whole thing is kinda like you know when you have um companies like enron that um [sigh] 

91.03 96.02 B: you know do what they did um it really undermines um 

96.33 106.83 B: undermines confidence so you don't have as many investors willing to invest in those larger companies which means the company don't have as much money which means they you know lay off workers i mean it's 

106.63 109.49 A: [noise] 

106.66 117.30 B: it's bad e- essentially our entire economy it seems is based on a certain level of trust you know that you that you trust people and and when people take advantage of that 

112.25 112.95 A: uh-huh 

117.34 127.04 B: ah it really is you know i mean a few people get rich but i- it really hurts the vast majority of people and ultimately trickles down to people like you and i 

123.63 125.30 A: (( [noise] [noise] it )) 

126.39 138.36 A: is kinda funny because enron in itself i don't think [noise] really i think it was just oh if they could lie then other people i think it was stuff like the lovely arthur andersen you know 

138.35 142.09 A: wait these are the people who are supposedly patrolling everything 

141.79 142.68 B: yeah 

141.90 155.25 A: the fact that you know all the stuff that was going on with the s._e._c. where wi- where the s._e._c. chairman had to resign for conflict of interest and you know et cetera et cetera it's like all of sudden it's like okay one company goes down 

150.80 151.76 B: yeah 

155.20 165.06 A: no one's happy but you know every few years some comp- yeah well this was the biggest sin- you know since like the twenties [laughter] so all right maybe there was a little something in enron 

162.19 163.32 B: yeah 

164.18 165.40 B: yeah 

165.17 166.97 A: but at the same time i mean 

166.76 172.27 A: looking at the arthur andersens and looking at all those you know the fact that 

172.28 182.43 A: the people who are supposed to be protecting us or are supposed to be giving us the information you know the analysts and all this and to see all the extra interests that were involved 

182.14 183.30 B: (( [mn] right )) 

182.32 193.10 A: i guess when you look at that i would hope you know more happens with the government it's not so much more laws or more like oh if you do this we're gonna slap you really hard 

192.87 202.49 A: it's just forcing more openness in a sense that better data you know more real time data better you know forcing companies to actually s- 

202.30 213.62 A: reali- you know to say what's going on with [noise] their financials you know and to keep it open so other people can look in where it's not such a card game in a sense 

205.98 207.08 B: right 

212.65 220.58 B: yeah well you bring up a really interesting point there too something that i hadn't really thought about but makes perfect sense and that is 

220.69 230.11 B: that um companies like andersen really their job like you're saying i- it really is um to protect us and to audit these companies and whatever 

230.10 241.66 B: and yet um the policing force of the companies you know i mean i- if that's the function that they serve um and they have some sort of a profitable interest in um 

234.00 235.46 A: (( [noise] )) 

242.10 251.42 B: in you know propelling the lie as andersen did um then you're right it it makes a difficult ah 

251.56 256.66 B: you know i- [mn] th- th- the real question for me is who then can you trust you know 

256.60 262.95 B: and i think i think by being more open or by the government playing that role um 

256.63 257.38 A: well 

257.97 261.54 A: [noise] 

262.88 275.99 B: it might kind of cause any conflict of interest that might be kind of out into the open and and that might help restore you know confidence in the in investing and confidence in the company 

275.71 287.14 A: oh yeah i i agree completely i think you know it's like sh- i don't have a problem with so much you know one company doing auditing and consulting as long as it's front up and center it's like 

286.70 287.70 B: yeah 

287.10 301.72 A: um who's the [noise] financial analyst who got slapped around but now is back on um c._n._b._c. um kramer or whatever his name is yeah you know the guy with the big mouth and the thing is i was watching he was on something and i was watching it the other day when i was at the gym 

294.15 296.14 B: oh yeah yeah 

301.73 304.14 A: and almost after every stock he's like 

304.13 316.78 A: oh i own a position in this or you know it was like i used to own a position in this or you know it's like you know what if that were sort the way where it's like oh you know you look af- you know you look to the financial prospectus 

309.36 310.20 B: yeah 

316.64 326.58 A: they came out like oh yes we were audited by arthur andersen if there was also the next line being oh and they also did our consulting for you know x million dollars 

326.44 339.57 A: and here's the information that they looked over you know people would go over with a finer tooth you know comb it would just be like okay [mn] oh so they did both well let's look at the numbers closely none of this eh you know 

331.33 332.36 B: yeah 

339.87 343.33 A: you know give us real data give you know 

343.28 347.24 A: no not everyone is gonna look but enough people especially in this 

347.25 360.98 A: day and age are gonna sit down and go through it closely to then be able to get the information out and i think that just sort of like i don't know the analysts it's very interesting i think if the government 

354.44 355.75 B: yeah 

360.83 374.65 A: um the whole deal that wh happened where the finan- you know financial analysts for a lot of the investment banks did you he- they forced them to say okay you know if you know you gotta say what you own you can't yeah you have to 

367.02 368.12 B: exactly 

374.77 386.94 A: break up the ties of saying 'all right well our investment bank is buying this so therefore our analysts are gonna boom it' but right after they agreed to this just like a month later one of them got caught 

387.40 392.36 A: not merrill maybe it was merrill lynch got caught um paying another investment firm 

392.40 396.75 A: to highlight with their analysts so it's like oh yeah we 

394.78 397.31 B: oh i hadn't heard about that 

396.65 410.56 A: won't do it but we'll pay someone else to do it [laughter] it's like okay you know they got caught but those are the types of things i really [noise] i want more of from the government none of you know n- 

400.47 401.70 B: yeah 

410.49 418.76 A: i do- i could care less if the president of the company signs his name on a piece of paper and says i'll go to jail if we lie you know that does nothing 'cause [mn] 

416.23 417.17 B: yeah 

418.63 432.63 A: they have to get caught but if they force them to do real time of like insider trading you know insider stock purchase or sales you know all those types of stuff then it's like okay that could mean something 

420.15 421.00 B: yeah 

431.29 439.68 B: yeah you suppose if the government um forces more open disclosure ah that it might hurt the marketplace at all 

439.43 442.04 A: oh i think it would hurt i mean 

442.07 452.86 A: what would happen is it depends on how it's done 'cause you gotta look at like um like this whole debate about options you know expensing options versus 

451.84 452.70 B: right 

453.09 460.58 A: you know taking them as a write off and all those fun things it's like the companies that do are gonna show a lot less 

460.62 471.95 A: you know income you know because they're expenses especially for a technology company but the thing is if enough companies do it and are vocal enough 

462.56 463.86 B: yeah 

466.31 467.35 B: you're right 

472.27 478.30 A: you know you start taking away a lot of the surprises where you start going okay you know what 

478.09 479.42 A: this company 

479.43 489.07 A: yeah it doesn't have as good a p._e. earning and blah blah blah blah but in reality they might have a higher p._e. earnings 'cause they've already taken out x. y. z expenses 

489.07 502.90 A: you know so like you go and look at someone else's who doesn't take out their option expenses but i at least know what they are i could calculate it myself you know who cares if this guy you know publishes that have a p._e. of five 

497.49 498.40 B: right 

502.74 507.68 A: if i can put the numbers together and see in reality he has a p._e. of four hundred 

507.60 509.03 B: yeah 

508.93 513.40 A: and i think that would help a lot 

510.04 511.09 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

512.19 519.27 B: yeah so i mean essentially it sounds like what you're saying is ah number one to have ah more disclosure which will ah 

519.40 526.36 B: you know more disclosure which'll you know restore confidence and hopefully not cause 

526.62 540.31 B: you know the type of problems ah that were associated with enron and et cetera et cetera and number two to have it ah to have it be it has to be consistent and straight across the board with all companies 

531.80 532.95 A: (( yeah )) 

538.76 541.27 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

540.13 547.43 B: in order so that um it doesn't just end up hurting a few companies and you know whatever but really that the government has to 

547.58 552.95 B: you know force more open disclosure and and make it consistent straight across the board 

552.32 563.37 A: yeah i think it would be interesting right now 'cause a few companies have on their own started saying all right we're you know we're gonna come out and open up you know a lot of you know especially people like w- 

563.38 573.99 A: you know where warren buffet's active he's been forcing a lot of companies to be more open that he owns positions in it'd be interesting to see what the effect on their stocks are when they show you know 

568.53 569.78 B: mhm 

574.46 588.25 A: all these things if their stock took hits or you know actually you know got a little benefit because people believe their numbers more that would be you know that would be an interesting thing to find out but i think the government 

583.39 584.43 B: yeah 

588.07 599.95 A: instead of trying to police you know who does what or how you know i think by f- you know having an open type of financial disclosure requirement not just you know this
