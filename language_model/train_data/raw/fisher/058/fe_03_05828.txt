1.78 3.84 A: hello there this is andrew 

3.66 5.11 B: andrew i'm steven 

5.08 7.63 A: hey steven nice to meet you as it were 

6.40 8.64 B: nice to meet you how are you today 

7.65 11.26 A: [laughter] i'm good um and yourself 

10.95 12.68 B: very well thank you 

12.02 15.62 A: i'm i'm finding today's topic very interesting um 

15.53 16.38 B: yes 

15.76 22.84 A: i i i myself am currently unemployed and have been for the past four months so this is a subject that definitely strikes home for me [laughter] 

21.78 25.27 B: uh-huh and were you working in the corporate world 

23.19 24.00 A: uh 

25.07 29.46 A: um i was working in information technology for a corporate company 

28.80 30.22 B: i see 

29.61 35.85 A: so i i i am yet you yet another in the many ranks of unemployed geeks right now [laughter] 

34.58 37.30 B: uh-huh are are you a programmer 

37.27 42.38 A: um no mostly i network engineer uh technical support that sort of thing 

41.79 43.23 B: i see so 

42.58 48.95 A: so yeah uh basically my job was keeping the blinky lights and everything going [laughter] 

47.19 49.10 B: uh-huh gotcha 

49.20 62.02 A: so i i i i find today's topic interesting as i said and uh you know um definitely i think corporate accountability has not to put a too fine a point has gone down the shitter recently um 

49.23 50.28 B: [laughter] 

61.67 63.12 B: absolutely 

62.54 77.34 A: i i think that you know w- a- a lot of you know uh board boards of directors for various incendiary companies are so obsessive about the bottom line than the here and now and the immediate stock returns that there is no long term accountability and i think 

77.43 86.39 A: that's the phrase that's missing from a lot of the dialogues today in in terms of uh you know [laughter] what do we do about these companies because it's all about the here and now 

86.37 96.26 A: and there's no looking back on certain companies long term you know performance say over the past decade or two decades or so i- it's all very flash in the pan so uh 

93.17 94.36 B: mhm 

96.21 105.66 A: i think that uh government definitely needs to take a look at you know addressing those companies that you know haven't taken long term goals and also you know 

105.79 112.96 A: providing these examples companies that have you know stood up and you know done something over the past two decades have really taken care of uh 

113.00 122.18 A: not only their employees but you know their shareholders too and have consistently done the right and proper thing instead of the um monetarily expedient thing 

121.54 125.84 B: yes and you know i i feel like th- this approach uh 

125.86 139.19 B: that you're talking about which i i agree with what you're saying is extremely short sighted because i think it impacts the consumer in the service area in a very important way and that it to me is it's just an 

139.17 147.05 B: ongoing source of irritation in dealing with these corporations and observing some of the practices they use 

147.02 158.04 B: to squeeze money out of customers and what happens is the customers very quickly lose trust in these companies and get irritated and so 

157.90 169.71 B: i think it impacts their bottom line i- it's not even all that long term i think people are getting a- are increasingly infuriated with the way they're being treated by these corporations and the kind of service they're getting 

169.61 173.12 B: and and comparing it with the kind of service they used to get 

174.33 185.85 A: oh absolutely i mean you know i i i found myself you know [laughter] you know saying i would often say to my girlfriend that i'm seeing l- look out honey i'm i'm about to put on my old codger hat and complain because 

174.88 175.63 B: (( [laughter] )) 

185.75 186.84 A: you know even 

186.61 201.16 A: two or three four years ago things you know there there are certain things especially you know in in the technical services industry where i had to you know call up certain vendors for support and you know used to be there certain people you could always rely on you could get somebody on the phone and uh 

188.43 189.23 B: yeah 

200.69 202.25 B: yeah 

201.30 214.62 A: nowadays you know um the the euphemism that i've heard uh some of my out of work friends use is uh these jobs have been globally rebalanced to say uh bangalore india you know over there and um 

209.07 210.99 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

211.78 213.20 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

213.43 214.63 B: (( right )) 

214.64 221.67 A: you know first of all you you're getting people that you know just aren't as accountable because they're not there they're they're outsourced 

219.95 220.82 B: yeah 

221.75 233.40 A: and secondly you know you've taken jobs out of the u._s. market which you know okay it makes the bottom line for a company look really good and whoa hoo hoo look at our stock portfolio look at all this fat we've trimmed 

225.47 226.30 B: right 

233.43 245.23 A: but then you've taken all this money out of the economy which can no longer be used for you know taxation which means what are you know local state and federal governments going to do you know 

244.21 247.12 B: and you're alienating the the consumers 

246.98 248.71 A: absolutely 

247.29 261.12 B: e- e- each day more more profoundly people are getting turned off by by this by this practice and by the fact that the- i- they are clearly operating from a very cold sort of mechanistic bottom line 

261.15 269.63 B: uh mentality rather than a service mentali- i- it's really you know i i come at this from a little different point of view i'm a composer and uh 

269.35 270.41 A: oh really 

269.84 284.14 B: i i've done a lot of uh spiritual work in search of the source of creativity and and so in my you know in my spiritual work i'm finding that uh the way that i treat people 

284.22 289.53 B: on a day to day basis has a very powerful impact obviously on what on my success 

289.77 293.69 B: and uh it's just basic it's very basic human 

291.85 294.56 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

293.84 298.50 B: you know sort of golden rule kind of mentality that's missing from this 

299.07 313.65 A: absolutely and tr- you know one one of the basic tenants i learned when i was very young which is you treat people how you yourself would like to be treated and i know that you know whenever i was in a position where i would be taking someone's technical support call you know 

306.52 307.34 B: yes 

313.71 322.47 A: i- it used to be that you know there was there was an immed- you know assumption that okay the person on the other end while they're working for a corporation is gonna give me a fair shake 

322.49 327.16 A: now you know in the the past year up until i was laid off if i got a phone call 

327.25 333.79 A: people were much more adversarial immediately and it was i i had to put a lot more effort out there to go ahead and say 

329.54 330.69 B: yeah yeah 

333.83 347.24 A: to let them know look i'm listening to your problem and i'm gonna help but you know and of course you know people people vote with their pocketbooks and it that's why i'm out of a job now [laughter] you know because 

342.71 343.71 B: absolutely 

345.87 351.80 B: and i find myself increasingly drawn to companies just because i get the feeling that they're going to 

351.82 357.98 B: give good and sort of human oriented service to back up whatever it is they're selling [laughter] and 

357.65 359.48 A: oh absolutely [noise] 

357.96 370.96 B: i i if i think that i- that i'm gonna have a horrible time reaching somebody if i have a problem or if i'm going to get like this the cable company that uh that i get my uh internet service and and television from 

371.04 379.95 B: has this practice of they say they sent you a notice that you're going to get some kind of increased service that's going to cost more 

378.32 379.57 A: [laughter] 

379.75 386.11 B: and if you don't respond they'll assume that you want it so suddenly i find charges added on to my bill 

385.77 388.51 A: mm ssilence is complicity yeah [laughter] 

386.24 387.05 B: that 

387.65 394.32 B: i i never asked for these things and i often didn't even get the notification that they were going to do this 

394.17 403.44 B: and it just infuriates me it just brings out a a i i hate them [laughter] you know uh if there's any alternative i'll go to somebody else after something like that happens 

404.81 407.69 B: i didn't realize i was so emotional about this [laughter] but 

407.98 408.98 B: um 

409.08 411.35 B: it's very em- it's a very important issue 

412.63 413.70 B: are you there 

413.95 414.72 B: uh 

417.16 418.92 B: we seem to have lost each other

432.50 434.20 B: (( all right ))
