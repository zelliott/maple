22.40 33.10 A: ah i've always been pretty close to my family like they mean a lot to me like i guess it's just like i have like the classic view of a family like somebody that i come home and they're there they're they're there for you and they 

33.57 35.58 A: can be for what you're going through 

38.39 51.38 B: i agree ah i come from a close knit family also and we have b- b- black sheep in our family but we still stick close to them ah family's very important especially in raising the children ah it shows about bonding

69.97 72.86 A: i guess that's like the biggest thing i get from my family 

73.03 80.82 A: 'cause like the way that like that is something that that what they think is really important in their ideas has like left a big impact on me 

83.37 87.97 B: yeah i i think i agree um especially in the in the arguments you learn to argue ah 

88.26 94.17 B: ah productively you get to listen and you learn to compromise and your family's really important 

95.18 96.77 A: (( and ah basically just )) 

95.41 96.42 B: i raised 

96.92 98.01 B: oh go ahead 

97.30 100.79 A: your fam- when you're younger your family just basically gets you to 

101.71 108.02 A: for the real world and it leaves you with friendships and everything it basically trains you for the your entire life 

108.98 116.41 B: oh i agree they're the guidelines that they teach you i mean we produce what we are it's just that they teach us the guidelines the proper things to do 

118.88 120.91 A: i ah what else ah 

128.11 130.74 A: i don't know what else is there to talk about families 

135.06 135.94 A: hello 

135.95 138.26 B: yes i'm here okay let's see um [mn] 

138.76 142.33 A: sorry there's a plane going over my head right now so it's kind of hard to hear 

140.12 147.23 B: and oh okay so i'm talking on my cellphone i have only the door open so we have traffic outside the house so [laughter] 

146.18 147.51 A: yeah like [laughter] 

147.77 149.38 B: ah i've 

148.69 152.64 A: talking on the cellphone isn't really the best place to have this but we should probably stay on the topic 

152.77 156.71 B: yes um there's a lot of things that they don't um 

157.06 161.12 B: like m- probably my most important thing in my family was was my grandmother 

161.26 164.00 B: um she brought me back to the old world 

164.08 173.93 B: ah she taught me the rules ah that i believe is important today for kids who are growing up in a in a multi culture melting pot ah type of um 

172.67 173.62 A: yeah 

174.79 177.84 B: so you know each person is that's what makes us individuals 

177.99 185.84 A: yeah like that's i guess that's one one thing that i really lacked in my family 'cause i'm you know i've lived like this is like the fifth or sixth generation that's 

178.11 179.29 B: and it's great 

186.05 191.40 A: been in america so i you know i'm not really exposed to that through my family but 

192.36 196.22 A: i guess that like just everybody's different situations are different 

195.58 200.01 B: oh okay well i agree too but y- yeah you know they still have they 

200.27 201.51 B: (( have needed )) 

201.62 205.92 B: each parent or as you grow up you carry your traditions from 

206.91 210.79 B: from your ancestors and it's from some in most cases 

208.68 209.92 A: yeah 

210.92 212.21 B: and so 

212.37 225.23 B: you know th- these are things i bring back to my children i teach them you know what you know that you're american and remember this is a melting pot be who you are succeed best at what you can do make sure you get an education 

225.20 230.12 B: um these are guidelines i bring them through ah i praise them um 

230.21 235.53 B: as my parents praised me which made me mine have you know continued to do more 

236.14 241.87 A: yeah oh try think of different things to talk about um 

245.97 252.53 A: ah this is a bad topic for me well not really a bad topic it's a hard topic for me 'cause i don't really have much 

247.65 248.96 B: (( i- [laughter] )) 

252.72 254.79 A: to say about it 

253.96 258.67 B: i think that may have this i i think family has a lot of problems of output 

258.84 263.82 B: um there are some families where um abuse is involved 

263.88 269.42 B: um i feel that that you know in especially in today's times where it needs to be correcting 

269.66 273.70 B: um i believe that they should teach parenting in in in school 

273.98 275.17 B: ah so they 

274.04 278.44 A: yeah i i completely agree with that like i mean like i guess 

279.23 287.02 A: college i but like i see people around me that are having kids like that and you see how they treat them and it's just it's insane [laughter] 

287.73 289.00 A: how 

287.89 289.34 B: what that 

289.06 291.90 A: how almost pathetic it is 

291.86 297.33 B: [mn] it is and that that you know and when they when you look at the family value they're that that patheticness is [mn] 

297.82 299.69 B: is continued through the child 

300.37 302.11 A: yeah 

300.78 305.41 B: and and so i think of family i think the unity of the family ah proper 

305.55 307.25 B: is plays a whole 

307.73 320.04 B: large value to they contribute contribute ah contribute actually [laughter] contribute it to that family unit and as a child grows up they you know produce that to their offspring etcetera 

320.72 321.92 A: yeah ah 

322.74 324.18 A: (( it's like )) 

324.77 327.27 A: but i kind of got what you were saying [laughter] 

327.48 328.91 B: [laughter] it's 

329.51 333.59 A: i'm sorry i i'm not into right now but 

334.35 339.28 A: um mm something there for a second that i didn't talk about i completely forgot it mm 

346.33 348.43 B: (( okay let's see )) 

349.42 353.89 A: it'd be nice if there were somewhere that they could keep the conversation with different prompts like that 

352.28 361.16 B: right ah ah let's see ah how about um [mn] okay brothers and sisters ah i think brothers and sisters play a large part of um ah 

362.52 375.13 B: that governing ah body of the family because you know the older your your brother is or your sister is they show more the responsibility the younger they are it plays a role in that line 

375.36 376.89 B: (( um let's see )) 

377.68 380.87 B: ah which are of course the parents guide 

381.03 381.99 B: um 

383.08 384.16 B: let's see what's 

384.97 387.62 A: see like one thing with ah like my 

385.34 386.94 B: yeah 

387.51 394.21 A: a little bit younger but like i don't know this is not really what she's or i guess this is kind of what she did to me 

393.99 406.16 A: but like i through my sister and talking to like other friends that are female like i learned a lot of like what i did wrong being a big brother and stuff like that 'cause i heard 

406.01 417.52 A: like different things that girls have told to me about their big brothers how they pick on 'em and stuff like that and it's really taught me to be more sensitive to not just my sister but to others in general because 

417.52 422.69 A: i guess that's not really family like i said it's friends that are interacting or that are teaching me that but ah 

422.84 425.88 A: i guess that's a big thing that just that the interaction 

425.93 433.01 A: with other people has taught me with my sister how to h- what where i've gone wrong and has pointed out mistakes to me before 

433.33 444.59 B: oh i agree very much um i'm i'm the baby in my family but i watch my big brothers and my big sisters and see what they went through and say like oh my god they how how um is this how i want to treat people 

444.72 450.10 B: and um thank god we never fought in my family there was a rule in my family that we don't fight with each other 

450.38 451.55 B: and um 

450.63 451.95 A: yeah 

452.14 454.51 B: so we learned a lot through just 

455.29 462.22 B: like talking things out something you know sometimes we yell and scream at each other but i think all families do that ah 

455.71 456.58 A: yeah 

461.19 466.61 A: yeah i see that like i don't have a big brother or anything like that but like and the people i do see 

466.51 479.03 A: a lot where a like i it's incredible how much of an influence like a big brother will have on a younger child or a a a brother that's maybe a couple of years youn- younger and it's like that and just really influencing them from everything like 

479.06 491.33 A: the type of music they or the the and the type of people they are all kinds of stuff like that you really see like all over the place like going their fr- seeing friends and stuff like that and how they interact with their family it's so apparent how 

491.31 495.67 A: just the whole family ah everybody in the family affects the different people 

496.46 501.05 B: well i agree it it it and then there's a- another point of idolizing you know it's 

501.24 507.20 B: i idolize my older sister and my older brother for a lot of things but the older i got i've just been you know 

507.45 518.18 B: it's just something i learnt from them and now you know my kids they look at me and my brothers and my sisters now idolize me for who i am and i don't know there there's no point in that and this is something i learned from new 

518.72 522.04 B: and ah this is something that was brought to us by our parents 

522.07 532.17 B: not even through our hardships ah we know how to deal with hardships in a certain way we learn that that's character we learn that you know hardships doesn't mean that you go out and shoot somebody because you're having a bad day 

532.25 533.31 B: um 

534.19 538.08 B: it just gives us respect for you know people that for life period 

539.24 542.35 A: yeah i i agree with that 

549.35 553.46 B: ah family ah you know the family unit is very important ah 

553.75 557.24 B: it it plays a major part in anyone's life 

557.31 564.84 B: um as as as as i find it difficult for single parents ah to raise their children now i've been a single parent for a while 

557.58 559.38 A: yes definitely 

565.07 577.14 B: and um while i still am a single parent but all my kids are grown now but i tried my best and i tried it's hard to make up for my wife who passed away um they miss their mother but it's 

569.03 570.06 A: yeah 

577.66 584.14 B: it's difficult but i didn't do too bad i learned that encouraging ah praising your children 

584.50 585.48 B: um 

585.79 599.89 B: ah t- teaching them what is right and wrong um sometimes you know um in my family religion played an important part for morals ah it plays a big part so i tried to do that's my children also so i don't feel that
