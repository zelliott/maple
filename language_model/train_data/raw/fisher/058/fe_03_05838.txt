17.50 20.47 A: i guess i'm vic- pessimistic person 

21.32 23.09 B: yeah i think um 

23.22 28.81 B: by their very nature and the way they're kinda intertwined i think for the government to really regulate 

28.60 41.39 B: big business that would in essence hurt them and it would hurt their interests so i don't i don't think there's any way that the government's ever really going to truly regulate you know corporations in the interest of the american people

41.15 43.33 A: i totally agree with you

90.22 91.44 B: yeah 

90.77 100.98 A: and like just here you wonder with boeing what's gonna be what's gonna be how is this city gonna change with you know if boeing leaves and because this used to be a a real 

101.02 103.38 A: powerful company and if you 

102.71 105.53 B: yeah if aren't they based out of seattle 

104.91 106.71 A: got yeah they are 

106.12 107.65 B: (( oh gosh [noise] mm )) 

106.92 118.31 A: yeah they certainly are and [sigh] like i said you know i was at the airport today and you know one of the things in the front page was five thousand to be laid off 

118.58 120.33 A: and um 

120.39 124.25 A: you know a a friend and i were talking wh- you know what how was that gonna [mn] 

124.50 128.12 A: you know once again change the city and weaken it and uh 

128.41 138.09 A: you know the the problems that are gonna be following and uh [sigh] you know still so many people out of work that i just don't know 

138.17 139.97 A: what that's gonna say 

139.99 142.08 B: yeah 

141.55 142.82 A: and um 

143.21 147.64 A: i was talking to a friend and he has no company loyalty anymore because 

143.27 143.94 B: (( w- )) 

147.73 151.22 A: you know the last two companies he's worked for have gone 

151.59 153.94 A: have gone belly up 

153.40 154.12 B: (( mm )) 

154.30 155.82 A: and uh so 

156.54 159.18 A: i just don't see any 

159.58 164.54 A: easy fix or early you know a a positive prognosis here [laughter] 

164.04 170.34 B: [laughter] no absolutely i mean have have you specifically been affected by it directly or 

170.35 171.82 B: uh just through 

171.55 173.06 A: (( [sigh] i haven't dir- )) 

172.13 173.84 B: like you said through friends 

173.54 175.39 A: i haven't directly just 

175.52 179.97 A: friends and uh acquaintances and um 

177.89 178.61 B: (( mm )) 

180.95 186.54 A: cause i've had you know friends working for boeing and then when they lost their job 

186.81 195.44 A: and you know going from a pretty nice salary to unemployment and looking for a job and trying to sell yourself again 

194.98 196.13 B: yeah 

195.63 197.14 A: and um 

197.23 210.67 A: some have had a real hard time finding an- and finding a comparable job you know comparable salary comparable position i've seen friends taking take that have taken 

211.77 218.01 A: cuts and have worked humble jobs compared to what they were doing you know 

217.54 219.14 B: mm absolutely 

219.21 225.28 A: yeah and so i [sigh] to think that there's any security just cause you have a decent job these days 

224.98 225.94 B: yeah 

225.97 230.41 B: definitely my situation right now i've i've been in new york for two weeks 

230.09 231.36 A: wow 

231.14 244.86 B: and um [sigh] [laughter] and am trying to find employment and things like that and you're correct there's just there's very few people hiring right now i think the economy has just taken such an extreme downturn and there's 

244.80 254.63 B: there's no job security to the point where even if i wind up getting a good job in my field and enjoying it there's n- there's nothing to say that you know in a month the company might 

255.10 261.75 B: you know might be scaling back or downsizing and then you know i'm the lowest man on the totem pole so i'm gonna be the first one to go 

257.98 259.07 A: (( yep yeah )) 

262.06 264.81 A: so you just moved to new york 

264.27 266.01 B: yeah i did 

265.74 268.13 A: wow where'd you come from 

267.30 269.17 B: uh near philadelphia 

269.23 271.77 A: wow that took a lot of courage 

271.46 280.37 B: [laughter] yeah it's an interesting situation um my fiancee's starting grad school in the fall so we just basically picked up and moved here 

277.27 278.21 A: (( okay )) 

280.95 282.30 A: (( wow )) 

281.12 284.07 B: so [laughter] we're staying with friends and 

283.77 285.18 A: good 

284.51 294.38 B: no we're not employed and so it's it's interesting because it's definitely uh kind of a high pressure situation we need to get ourselves you know settled by 

291.06 292.87 A: [laughter] 

294.51 296.06 B: this time next month 

296.34 301.75 A: uh yeah [laughter] well well in your case it's kinda scary but fun too you know 

297.33 298.66 B: [laughter] 

301.26 304.38 B: oh yes it it's an adventure but it's still it's 

304.64 308.55 B: it definitely it can be terrifying at times [laughter] 

306.60 312.51 A: [laughter] y- yes yes uh so you're out of school 

310.72 311.28 B: (( [noise] )) 

312.09 316.27 B: yes i am um i'm i've been out for two years now 

313.34 314.25 A: yeah 

316.62 321.09 A: yeah um one of the smartest things i did was i i finished my master's degree ten years ago 

320.87 322.10 B: oh wow 

321.14 329.92 A: you know and i'm just so glad i did because now i you know we were saying i you and i were talking about i i couldn't go back to school now it would just be impossible 

329.42 330.83 B: yeah 

330.01 332.92 A: you know with all kinds of things and 

331.94 333.45 B: what's your degree in 

333.36 335.25 A: um psychology 

335.12 336.85 B: oh great great 

335.84 339.49 A: yeah i got a master's in psychology and um 

339.66 344.35 A: but and like w- what are you like early twenties 

344.16 345.95 B: yeah uh mid twenties 

345.72 360.13 A: yeah like see i'm fifty four when you're my age god knows what the wh- what things are gonna be like you know [laughter] and i i fear for children and my kids my kids aren't that young any more but you know what they're facing 

351.13 352.93 B: (( yeah mm )) 

359.33 360.83 B: yeah 

360.68 367.78 A: because i remember when i was your age find find like you know you go to the gas station with a quarter and get a gallon of gas 

362.94 364.44 B: oh yeah 

367.49 369.04 B: yeah [laughter] 

368.06 378.89 A: you know [laughter] it's so things have have changed markedly and see like with seattle boeing may be going belly up and like i you know five thousand people are laid off once again 

379.24 387.66 A: and uh just wondering what is gonna happen to the city if if that company moves 

387.48 393.25 B: yeah i i i just think it's terrifying that our own government is 

388.17 389.12 A: and that's j- 

393.40 400.14 B: preaching that they're looking out for the interests of us and of other countries and it's 

397.53 399.11 A: oh yeah 

399.48 400.63 A: (( yes )) 

400.62 412.91 B: so thin and one sided and they're they're looking out for themselves and they're looking out for romanian imperialistic regime that they've that we've been since you know since the late [laughter] fifteenth century 

413.06 418.97 A: oh yeah like preaching is rightly or not they're not looking out for our best interests 

419.19 424.83 A: and um everything has become so dog eat dog you know 

424.17 425.12 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

425.20 427.96 A: and it's just a kind of a 

428.21 430.51 A: a frightening time to live 

430.16 431.27 B: yeah 

430.60 436.04 A: i know my kids depend which is fine you know very heavily on me and i'm trying to 

436.27 441.44 A: trying to get them stronger because you know if i effectively drop over dead today [laughter] you 

438.44 439.53 B: [laughter] 

440.99 442.60 B: [laughter] 

441.62 442.89 A: know because this is 

443.17 445.60 A: [laughter] this is not a time to be 

445.85 448.26 A: to be um vulnerable you know 

448.04 453.37 B: no absolutely this is this is definitely a time i think in our country's history when 

453.40 467.03 B: we can uh just like right now we can look back to ten years ago and point out you know the differences and how it was better back then c- i mean even two years from now we're gonna look back and and i mean my family was 

461.68 462.38 A: yeah 

467.26 472.89 B: i didn't know this at the time but my family was pretty directly affected um 

472.99 475.40 B: when enron went down a year ago 

475.02 476.50 A: really 

475.90 484.55 B: and i mean my my parents have had [noise] stock for years and i knew that we had stock but i had no idea what we had it in and i just knew that it was in 

484.37 485.58 A: wow 

484.60 487.26 B: and i don't know the first thing about stock i know it's 

486.64 487.46 A: (( [laughter] )) 

487.31 490.38 B: we had diversified portfolios that's all i knew 

490.04 491.22 A: okay 

491.04 505.17 B: but a big part of that of a diversified portfolio is energy and so when enron went down i mean we we lost uh a good chunk of money that i didn't really know until about six months ago when my mom told me so i mean we're 

503.67 506.25 A: [noise] wow so you've been yeah yeah 

505.62 507.72 B: we're definitely not you know we're 

508.26 517.80 B: we're not struggling as a result of it but i mean there has been a direct effect i mean it it affected my my stepfather's retirement he was gonna retire this year and now 

517.09 518.26 A: (( oh okay )) 

517.90 522.90 B: because of this situation he he can't he's gotta stay working for probably another three four years 

523.99 525.39 A: wow 

525.14 526.57 B: yeah 

525.76 527.55 A: yeah i was just um 

527.62 531.44 A: talking to a friend last night and um 

532.16 538.76 A: he wants to [sigh] to retire but there's no way you know not not imminently and um 

537.42 539.73 B: (( yeah )) 

538.95 543.71 A: was was looking forward to a an early retirement that is not gonna happen 

543.10 544.58 B: (( mhm )) 

545.00 548.18 B: that's the scary thing is that there's people who have been putting their 

547.98 558.88 B: their lives and all their money into a four o. one k. and into their benefits packages and i mean you never know with these companies if it's just gonna vanish i mean these things that you're putting your your life 

558.79 569.11 B: your life's work and your life savings into can just can completely up and disappear as as quickly as the company can lay off thousands of people your you know your financial stability can just vanish 

569.40 573.09 A: yeah yes vanish is the word too sadly 

571.90 574.23 B: mhm yeah 

573.20 576.33 A: and what i don't like it's changed me cause i'm 

576.81 586.27 A: [sigh] you know it's making me become more self centered and and more um you know looking out for my own interests which i don't like thinking that way but i'm having to you know 

579.92 580.64 B: (( [noise] mm )) 

585.95 587.29 B: oh yeah 

586.80 588.63 A: [sigh] you know because um 

588.79 593.22 A: in ten years i'm gonna be you know in my mid sixties and you have to look at things realistically 

593.11 599.98 B: yeah definitely and like you said about taking sort of a pessimistic attitude toward it i mean i i try
