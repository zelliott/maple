107.12 110.09 A: (( yeah )) 

111.64 121.21 A: yeah it's yeah you know and it's you know l- like i said we go on vacation and i like that because then it just slows down for that time where i don't have to be

175.01 177.40 A: ah well that's what i think is wr- ah ah 

177.28 180.51 A: what's wrong with a lot of kids these days 

180.35 183.07 A: you know because they have too much time 

183.08 196.65 A: with themselves and not with their parents and and like i said that's because in today's society both parents have to work like you said i'm lucky i i my wife only has to work part time but most parents have to work full time and ah and it's 

196.62 203.90 A: ah you got to make that time available and when you do have that time make it as much as possible you know the best you can 

203.49 217.19 B: right yeah yeah i mean it's getting to a point now like i think i heard on the news like some ah the government's going to give you money back or something if you spend time with your kids or a school district is going to give you money back if you actually spend time with your kids because that's how yeah yeah i know 

203.96 205.81 A: you make it 

215.46 229.48 A: well that's that's they had in that point that's kind of sad you know you know that's they're what they're saying is we know that you're working a lot we're going to give you money to try to spend time with your kids but that's the thing i want to do naturally it's just that it's so expen- 

218.67 219.48 B: (( yes )) 

228.44 242.64 B: well that's they they they have to prioritize it for those types of people i mean the only thing that they're looking for is the money and these people are like you know going out of their way to help them give them money so that they'll actually do what's supposed they're supposed to be doing anyway 

231.41 232.38 A: mhm 

234.19 234.99 A: uh-huh 

238.45 239.45 A: mhm 

242.10 244.63 A: (( yeah and )) 

242.78 247.15 B: and it's just it's just a just a warped kind of like morale situation 

245.96 251.62 A: mm mhm yeah that's something that should come naturally you know you shouldn't you know 

251.61 257.04 A: and you know maybe the government's thinking well maybe ah well that's another sad thing if the government knows that you're so 

256.91 258.01 A: you know 

257.84 266.08 A: where you don't have money to do stuff like that and they're saying well ah well let's give them some money so they can do something then that's a sad thing too 

265.86 275.36 A: you know they're saying that you know people are poor because i look at it this way there's two kinds of ah people now you've got poor and rich and you know 

266.06 266.97 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

275.38 284.51 A: i you know i work year around and very hard and ah and it always seems like that you just stay your head above water 

284.84 295.80 B: oh yeah definitely yeah it's like we can never do enough like you've always got to push a little bit further you've always got to like that especially the times when you think you like got everything covered and yeah right true right 

288.00 290.06 A: oh yeah yeah 

294.87 300.69 A: oh yeah that i just hit one of them days it's funny i just had one of them days like i got a ninety nine decoder

323.21 329.03 B: yeah exactly it's like you know you got to you got to find different ways you got to get more creative and it's like it seems like 

323.77 325.19 A: [laughter] 

326.15 326.82 A: (( mm )) 

327.49 329.87 A: yeah and then it'll be like okay ah 

329.19 334.06 B: just when you think you hit like a new a new low point or a high point whichever way you want to look at it 

331.84 333.14 A: (( [laughter] )) 

333.65 335.02 A: oh yeah because like 

334.09 338.03 B: sure enough next time around it's the same damn thing over again right right 

336.03 338.52 A: oh y- oh yes 'cause they know we ah 

338.53 346.82 A: you know talk about family i want to take my family we have what's called a farm fair um up in new jersey a big we're called the garden state for a reason we're a big farm state 

346.70 356.92 A: and ah we have a big farm fair and it's you know it's it's really nice you know so we want to go to that tomorrow and ah it's payday tomorrow but even though i got to pay all them bills i i i'll keep like i said ah 

356.93 369.07 A: paul will be paid later you know family comes first [laughter] you know you know instead like if my electric bills a hundred i'll give 'em fifty [laughter] put fifty in my pocket so i can take care of my family but yeah 

358.73 359.61 B: yeah 

359.93 361.95 B: see exactly like ah that's 

364.23 365.19 B: yeah 

366.96 373.28 B: exactly as long as you can you know show your family a good time i mean 'cause those those those moments you're not going to ever get back

374.56 376.58 A: you have you know 

376.41 381.38 A: you have to make that time because like you said y- you can never get that time back 

381.22 391.79 A: and that that's a that's the thing like ah mine my child's five years old and i remember my best friend he gave me the best advice remember every moment like when your when your daughter gives up the bottle 

391.60 396.67 A: then she gives up the sippy cup those moments pass by fast like you know my daughter's 

395.00 395.98 B: right 

397.19 406.44 A: so even you know tell me what i'm doing wrong [laughter] they're they're they're very funny you know but ah those moments pass by very fast 

400.12 401.35 B: yeah i 

405.63 417.53 B: yeah my brother told me the same thing he has a my nephew's four and a half it's his first son and ah he was telling me basically the same thing like when you see him do the ah the you know tie up his shoes for the first time 

408.78 409.36 A: (( mm )) 

416.92 418.06 A: (( mhm )) 

417.90 431.06 B: that's it you know it's never going to happen again he's never going to tell you that he keeps doing it because once he does it yeah and then that's it he's never going to it's never going to happen again so either you're there and you're a part of it or you just missed out 

418.83 420.50 A: y- oh yeah 

422.03 425.15 A: mhm no they'll show you that one time yeah 

430.47 443.71 A: that's right that's absolutely right 'cause i remember my daughter you know sh- you know how she showed me she tied my shoes [laughter] she said daddy let me tie 'em let let me tie your shoes i was like great ah ah it was ah you know it was awesome because 

437.53 438.43 B: (( oh yeah )) 

443.81 449.82 A: she was ah sh- that was the only thing she was behind in tieing shoes ah she just did it about a month ago 

449.58 460.26 A: and she was so excited and i she goes dad i let me let me show you i know how to tie shoes now so she did that that one time and ever since then i never see it again 

460.41 466.11 B: uh-huh [laughter] i think i think my brother gave up on this kid because he got the ah velcro sneakers 

460.84 462.36 A: just like ah when she was 

465.18 467.37 A: [laughter] 

466.15 478.31 B: 'cause anytime he gets any string like he starts making like knots and knots and knots and then he has this like natural tendency to go for tape and then he gets the tape like a you know like a roll of tape and he goes off on that 

470.02 471.38 A: [laughter] 

472.87 474.34 A: [laughter] 

476.41 477.29 A: (( mhm )) 

477.77 479.10 A: mhm [laughter] 

478.16 486.74 B: and he just the whole house gets taped up he tries to make knots with the tape and i don't know what the correlation is between string and tape but i don't know i guess it all makes sense to him right uh-huh right 

483.82 489.70 A: [laughter] ah it's a kid has a see kids have a big ima- imagination 

489.63 498.56 A: and that's another thing to watch you got to remember their imagination and it's also like when i i remember when my daughter was little she used to call her elbow belbow 

498.42 499.38 B: (( right right )) 

498.45 512.21 A: and now um then when all of a sudden that left i was like oh 'cause that was sweet to hear her go oh there's my belbow and and right and the only word left now that she doesn't say right is animals she calls them aminals 

511.66 513.40 B: right aminals right right 

512.26 516.64 A: yeah [laughter] so yeah those little moments you've got to cherish 

513.51 528.50 B: right yeah that's that's that kind of stuff and it and it's weird too because like you know i don't really my my brother's ah um first you know they're on the west coast and i'm actually you know i'm over here so it's like i i probably see him like maybe once a year 'cause our schedule's are so busy 

522.29 523.58 A: mhm 

528.06 529.06 A: mhm 

528.41 536.72 B: and it's just so weird like in a year like al- almost all the baby talk just said like disappeared and he was just like a little man now 

534.22 535.10 A: uh-huh 

536.64 547.37 B: you know like has his own wants and desires he wants to do this he wants to do that and it's like where the heck did you come from it's like you're not like a little baby anymore you're like a little you're like a little man 

537.19 538.05 A: (( o- oh )) 

543.43 546.81 A: oh yes that's that's very true it's like 

546.87 555.69 A: it's tr- ah well ah cats in the cradle that song right there that that song puts it before you know it they will be a grown grown man 

555.55 565.90 A: even you know you got to make them time you got whoa you got to because that's even with your like even my mom and dad you see my mom and dad are still alive and and ah 

565.70 570.97 A: i was fortunate with grandparents i had my grandparents for quite a while and ah 

571.03 578.38 A: you always say i'm going to get over and visit make sure you get over and visit before you know it's too late you know yeah 

576.16 586.19 B: yeah yeah well i can't say that i had the same experience my grandparents passed away all of them within like three years all of them just like it was like a big convention
