0.00 1.22 A: hi 

1.06 2.19 B: hi 

2.22 4.91 A: yeah um my name is ritchie 

4.72 7.89 B: yeah my name is steve 

7.00 8.76 A: okay how you doing 

8.18 9.13 B: okay 

9.01 14.51 A: okay so today's topic is what corporate ah behavior or something okay 

12.73 14.55 B: yeah 

14.83 25.21 A: yeah ah basically if my personal opinion is required i would say that i guess desperate people do desperate things at times um 

25.82 29.52 A: i mean people running the show are human right so 

29.58 31.46 B: yeah 

29.58 30.14 A: [noise] 

30.76 34.01 A: [lipsmack] i mean they have responsibilities but they make mistakes 

34.24 36.25 B: mhm 

35.07 40.45 A: so i don't know what if you can really blame them or not 

40.32 40.96 B: (( [noise] )) 

40.49 43.74 A: it does affect a lot of people in a bad way but 

44.27 45.47 A: i don't know 

46.14 54.46 A: i guess you have to be in their shoes to realize why they took those decisions and if they are doing it purely out of greed yeah [noise] that's totally wrong but [mn] 

54.76 55.89 A: i don't know 

55.83 66.32 B: yeah well i think [noise] that some people [noise] take the easy way out or just want to make as much money as possible without caring about the consequences 

66.25 67.16 A: (( hm )) 

66.25 71.69 B: so they take the money and they just do what they think is gonna work 

71.47 84.25 B: and then when it doesn't work in the end they don't want to take the responsibility for it it's sort of like [mn] you know it's easy to be a crook it's not but it's not easy to live with the consequences of being a crook 

83.84 85.30 A: yeah that's true 

86.11 97.25 B: yeah it's like anyone can you know say oh yeah let's make a whole lot of money dishonestly and hope we don't get caught unfortunately [mn] things don't usually work that way 

97.25 107.93 B: somebody gets caught somebody winds up paying for it [noise] 

100.96 101.93 A: mhm 

102.35 107.35 A: yeah and a lot of people innocent people get caught in between for no reason 

108.10 118.71 B: yeah it's a shame that you know you c- you used to be able to trust when people said things and did things [mn] and now you have to be so suspicious you know you 

118.48 124.57 B: you know like once upon a time co- a- companies actually lived up to their word 

125.00 135.53 B: [noise] they hired people they kept them on for thirty years and they d- built good products now it's like as long as they make money for shareholders nothing else matters 

135.49 136.57 A: yeah 

135.67 140.66 B: and there's just no loyalty no honesty no decency 

140.70 151.01 B: you know and when you tell the boss something's wrong they don't want to hear it they just want and they don't want to have their l- you know as long as they make their money they're okay 

151.36 156.31 A: mhm yeah and i think that's basically what 

153.08 155.10 B: yeah 

156.35 168.92 A: what everyone is scared of in the economy right now right that they don't know who to trust who not to trust they don't trust the analysts they don't trust the company people they don't trust the newspapers 

157.67 158.41 B: (( [cough] )) 

159.78 161.65 B: yeah 

168.69 169.59 B: mhm 

169.22 174.27 A: no one's really will to put their money in the market just because 

174.29 185.35 A: some some companies said that they expect better earnings that doesn't mean that they will get it and s- some companies saying they had better earnings doesn't mean that they really had them 

178.22 179.18 B: (( [noise] mm )) 

185.26 194.43 B: yeah i- it's it's on it's on you know you're you don't want to p- you know people didn't want to rely on stocks to make money they 

186.03 187.12 A: yeah 

194.58 203.26 B: rely on them as an investment now everybody want it j- they just want to be rich and make money so as now [mn] you know it's [mn] 

203.41 204.30 B: (( you know )) 

204.44 208.44 B: i- i- it's so different you know you can't trust [noise] 

209.05 209.94 B: um 

210.56 224.21 B: even your broker to be honest with you any more 'cause he's making his money and everyone is making their money all the way down the line [noise] except for you so you know when the com- you know brokers make money no matter what happens 

214.22 215.39 A: mhm 

223.88 225.27 A: (( [lipsmack] right )) 

224.83 230.67 B: so you know they sell and buy stocks and you know it's like if you lose your money 

229.89 231.14 A: [laughter] 

230.54 232.89 B: (( oh well you know that's like you know )) 

232.66 240.91 B: sorry that happened you know and that's that's a shame because you know you have to be able to trust 

234.69 235.92 A: yeah 

240.81 253.07 B: someone at some point with something and it's a shame that you can't even rely on the people who're supposed to be reliable i- it's sort of um 

254.51 259.63 B: you know it's disheartening it's kinda kinda sad you know like you turn the newsp- here 

259.41 270.87 B: you open up the newspaper and it's like you know which corporate executive is going to jail today or being indicted i- you know it's like and that that's not a good way to live you 

264.77 265.71 A: [laughter] 

270.04 271.74 A: right that's true 

271.30 274.94 B: you want to you want to be able to trust 

275.16 276.17 B: um 

276.73 285.49 B: [mn] like when you put your money someplace that it stays someplace without being used by crooks you know so they can have you know nicer houses 

285.76 286.71 A: mhm 

285.77 289.55 B: you know but it's just [mn] it's just kind of ridiculous ah yo- 

289.67 294.23 B: yo- you know you s- you expect one thing to happen and then 

294.43 298.91 B: it's not that it doesn't happen it's that it it only doesn't not happen but the people s- 

298.81 309.75 B: stealing the money are lau- almost laughing at you as they like have their big house and their kids go to harvard and you know they have lives with no suffering or concern and you 

309.86 318.68 B: we're supposed to trust these people a- and you know you they don't care whether you trust 'em or not they got their money 

311.91 313.32 A: mhm

463.06 474.93 A: [mn] yeah but the way these guys are going god knows [laughter] when that'll happen it's like there's no certainty when that can happen it can happen [mn] it might not even happen for the next ten years who knows 

474.57 482.46 B: i would i would hope it would t- i i think the economy will eventually get better i don't think this is gonna go on more than another
