16.75 17.99 B: um 

18.80 24.68 B: [noise] i didn't quite catch the topic i mean i got the gist of it but um can you hear the topic of the day 

24.75 35.42 A: okay basically um how has corporate scandals affected you or do you think um what is what is the affect of corporate scandals on america 

35.27 41.70 A: um do you believe it's responsible for the m- the mild recession that we we been having lately mm 

42.86 43.80 B: right 

43.83 45.03 A: mhm 

45.71 47.50 B: (( um [sigh] )) 

48.35 57.24 B: (( well uh personally for me to the the solution and uh you know the aftermath of the uh )) 

57.36 62.21 B: uh the uh tech boom and the uh bubble thereafter 

62.49 66.67 B: because i think um probably um because uh 

66.89 72.64 B: i think because of my ignorance at that point in time about um [lipsmack] 

70.31 71.39 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

72.87 75.44 B: about probably what i would call 

75.58 76.53 B: uh 

77.35 82.20 B: the truth as i see it wh- what actually goes on in in the um 

82.59 85.74 B: in in the stock market as well as uh 

85.76 89.63 B: uh the biggest uh financial institutions uh 

89.72 91.15 B: in america 

91.56 92.72 B: um 

93.23 97.50 B: [lipsmack] but initially e- i- i- i really could not believe uh 

97.58 111.86 B: um things that were coming out uh in in the newspapers you know arthur anderson and [sigh] uh citibank [sigh] merrill lynch you know just n- name a all those groups were like uh um being charged for 

111.90 113.98 B: um um 

114.42 121.88 B: for misguiding and misleading uh the investors and and thereby um 

118.18 119.35 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

122.44 137.36 B: in my words uh duping people uh of their money uh uh pretty blatantly knowing full well what they were doing [sigh] um so um i for me that was an eye opener um 

129.23 130.21 A: mhm 

137.80 140.49 B: uh but 

140.53 152.67 B: strangely enough i i went back and i um looked at the previous bubbles you know the south sea bubble the crash in nineteen forty nine and so on and so forth 

148.86 149.72 A: (( [noise] )) 

152.35 153.17 A: (( mm )) 

153.15 155.40 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

157.52 160.80 B: it just seems uh a a pretty n- 

161.26 165.16 B: normal phenomena that takes place every 

165.34 169.62 B: kind of every thirty forty years this this also happened in the eighties 

169.11 170.10 A: (( [noise] mm )) 

169.79 175.69 B: um you know um with the uh let's see 

176.04 177.52 B: (( uh )) 

178.03 181.55 B: (( um wagon we just on the uh king )) 

181.45 182.78 A: mhm 

182.64 192.43 B: so um i i guess you know whene- whenever there's an opportunity for uh people to make money off other people's um greed 

192.48 197.05 B: um you know i i think uh all those people 

197.12 201.82 B: uh waiting uh to take advantage of those situations i 

201.87 206.76 B: you know a- and and and to a very large extent it's pretty normal it's pretty human 

206.71 217.34 B: uh to do so it it probably requires a very strong willed person who's in a position to take advantage of other people you know fleece them of [laughter] their money 

217.14 218.04 A: (( mhm )) 

217.64 219.14 B: who would not do it 

219.34 221.04 B: so um 

221.69 222.84 B: [lipsmack] you know 

222.92 223.94 B: i mean 

223.97 232.48 B: y- uh i i'm presenting two sides of the coin i mean one is the shock and you know yes my eyes are opened and and um 

232.50 233.72 B: and um 

234.27 239.02 B: um and personally i would be very i am very skeptical 

239.12 250.75 B: of uh of uh the big firms in general you know not not over skeptical but you know skeptical to the extent i think uh i should be but i de- 

243.79 244.59 A: (( mhm )) 

250.69 258.08 B: at the same time i i also understand uh uh probably um the reasons you know 

258.38 260.99 B: uh natural human um 

261.54 263.00 B: reasons that uh 

263.38 265.72 B: why people would do such a thing 

265.90 266.84 A: mm 

267.37 268.77 A: well 

269.64 276.32 A: uh this is not shocking it isn't really shocking to me but what is kinda shocking is the response 

272.49 274.56 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

276.25 277.14 B: mhm 

276.43 286.89 A: to like the repercussions that happen because of uh people of just p- who who do this type of thing and like it it is kinda it is kinda human nature 

286.58 288.32 B: right 

286.83 294.15 A: um to wanna get ahead it is is very dar- darwinistic and everything don't you know only the strong survive 

289.03 290.02 B: right 

293.92 301.93 A: and so of course if you could take a shortcut then you're gonna take it which is understandable i mean it's not right it's it's lo- it's logical though 

298.54 300.89 B: right right 

301.72 303.57 B: right 

301.77 303.21 A: but 

303.01 311.32 A: [lipsmack] certain things are uh punished more than others and and th- and white collar crime and stuff like that is not one of 'em it's 

308.19 308.99 B: (( right [noise] )) 

311.10 319.64 A: it's punished kinda lightly uh you you have people uh going to jail uh for for um 

313.12 314.87 B: right 

316.77 318.37 B: right 

320.16 330.73 A: possessing crack you know possessing cocaine and these people who embel- embezzle embezzle millions of dollars don't even get jail time they get probation 

321.88 325.18 B: right right 

327.90 329.63 B: mhm 

330.68 331.90 B: right 

331.09 341.78 A: and as i i think it's bec- it might it maybe it's because it's a soft crime because people think oh well you know and he didn't hurt anyone but that's hurting people 

335.91 337.71 B: mhm 

341.48 342.41 B: (( right )) 

341.64 354.83 A: and you know we we [laughter] uh all of us hurt uh because of that and i believe it's contributed to the recession it's i mean the recess- recessions happen because they happen i mean they they come in waves 

343.25 345.01 B: (( yeah )) 

354.85 369.26 A: but i don't i don't think that me- [laughter] i don't think that america takes white collar white collar crimes seriously and it doesn't it doesn't try to it doesn't try to stop it at all i don't i think 

354.97 356.71 B: right 

364.70 366.36 B: right 

369.10 373.26 A: i don't know h- uh if you have a theory behind that because also 

369.87 370.76 B: right 

373.26 387.63 A: i think the main people who are running the the country the main people who are actually contributing to politicians who run the countr- the country are all these companies who are so rich and have all this money and so if they you know if they 

375.65 377.38 B: mhm 

383.06 383.86 B: right 

387.49 402.09 A: embezzle a few million dollars it doesn't hurt anyone 'cause we're still in power th- these are the um the people in power who are talking you know we're st- we're still in power and like they're still paying us off so it doesn't really matter but everyone but everyone else hurts in the long run so 

391.10 392.21 B: right 

399.31 400.47 B: (( right right )) 

401.98 403.01 A: i don't know 

403.42 405.39 B: right right um [lipsmack] 

407.28 417.11 B: um i i definitely uh i definitely agree with you i think it's it's taken uh far too lightly than it probably should have 

417.22 419.07 B: i mean um 

420.19 434.75 B: [mn] i mean we i guess we all know of uh stories of people who uh who've lo- lost their life savings which they invest in the stock market at that point in time due to bad advice and um on the part of the brokers that they'd uh 

428.59 429.76 A: mhm mhm 

434.74 437.54 B: they were paying and giving their money to 

437.89 439.39 B: um 

439.96 443.38 B: uh definitely i mean the country as a whole the 

443.42 457.74 B: people of the country as a whole are suffering because um because of the greed of of a few who who you know who made a killing not only people individually like uh i think kruger 

457.73 463.03 B: if that's his name but also the companies that we was representing 

463.16 464.58 B: and um 

464.67 472.01 B: and that that definitely was a very astonishing uh uh facet of this of this bust 

471.90 472.89 A: (( mhm )) 

472.19 473.48 B: um 

473.53 474.42 B: uh 

474.52 479.86 B: (( clearly during time he he was imprisoned for ten years )) 

479.27 480.60 A: right 

479.99 481.43 B: um 

482.08 487.00 B: [lipsmack] [laughter] not that that changed to much thereafter but you know 

486.91 501.89 B: i mean sending these uh people i- who knowingly duped other people of large sums of money um having a stronger punishment for them would send a very strong signal 

501.87 507.27 B: um throughout um the financial community that uh 

507.51 512.45 B: that that's not acceptable and and i think uh i think you're right i mean 

509.02 510.15 A: mhm mhm 

513.36 520.25 B: uh these companies and uh are probably the ones funding uh people uh in power 

520.27 525.09 B: even above them you know in politics and so on and so forth and and um [lipsmack] 

521.68 522.94 A: mhm 

525.50 529.72 B: which uh which um makes it uh difficult um 

530.00 533.77 B: um for them to be um probably given 

534.00 535.40 B: (( uh )) 

535.78 539.21 B: but but i think um 

542.31 557.19 B: politicians is one thing but i mean i'm not too um but what is surprising is you know law is supposed to be above politics it's supposed to be above all of that and and and um 

554.39 555.59 A: right 

557.91 559.24 B: [lipsmack] i guess 

559.71 560.94 B: um 

561.64 572.20 B: you know s- something would have to be done in in the books of law where perhaps some of these uh some of these actions 

572.21 575.28 B: (( uh were not previously )) 

575.56 576.79 B: um 

578.98 580.84 B: [lipsmack] um 

584.41 594.66 B: [lipsmack] they weren't previously considered that harmful um and and um i guess i guess the starting point would be 

587.96 589.14 A: (( mm )) 

594.71 596.13 B: um 

596.59 599.89 B: someone actually sitting down and and
