76.96 81.87 B: four one ks that i had from the one place where i did not retire but 

82.75 85.05 A: i think another topic was uh 

86.04 87.04 A: (( in the )) 

87.41 91.66 A: how can the government curb illegal business activities something like that 

90.74 91.93 B: yes

95.43 96.13 A: i

109.30 110.98 B: oh ok- okay 

111.11 112.00 A: yeah 

113.20 115.95 A: as far as the drug trade is concerned i i 

116.98 118.25 A: (( can you hear me )) 

117.63 119.01 B: yes i can 

118.72 119.55 A: okay 

126.86 127.67 B: well 

127.71 128.84 B: yes 

132.64 134.84 B: now you're you're breaking up now 

134.98 135.94 A: okay 

135.41 136.55 B: can't hear you 

136.82 138.00 A: th- what about now 

137.87 139.63 B: that's good 

139.27 140.05 A: okay 

140.22 143.01 A: yeah um i was saying uh the 

143.52 154.17 A: if they if they legalize marijuana then they could save all that money that they spend against marijuana and finding crops and all that and put that to another use you know it's i think it's over a billion dollars that they spend a year 

154.46 161.32 A: on things like that but i mean the moral aspect of course is that is that i mean condoning something like that 

161.88 163.07 A: i mean i think 

163.12 164.74 A: (( can you still hear me )) 

164.11 165.14 B: yes 

165.37 167.50 A: uh i've 

168.44 170.65 A: done by actually uh some senate 

171.23 182.18 A: from the seventies uh that nixon appointed that said they concluded that uh marijuana usage wasn't that harmful i- in the long term effects as far as memory is concerned 

182.21 188.52 A: i've heard it's actually less harmful then cigarettes because cigarettes you know all those chemicals cause all these cancers but i mean 

188.70 194.09 A: smoking anything is bad of course for your health but i don't know i think 

192.02 193.46 B: yes it is 

193.61 195.02 B: w- well being 

195.30 199.63 B: obviously somewhat older than you i have very mixed thoughts on that but 

199.61 200.71 A: mhm 

200.09 202.81 B: it would certainly be something that would be worth a trial 

203.96 207.36 B: and so where the government could uh 

204.09 205.40 A: yeah i mean 

208.19 212.46 B: indeed take control of part of it and tax it 

212.74 216.20 A: yeah another yeah right they could tax it and make money of that 

215.59 219.17 B: have additional additional tax income 

218.84 221.82 A: right l- like uh all those commercials 

221.84 223.34 A: i see that uh 

223.44 224.61 A: all are 

224.78 234.54 A: you you buy uh marijuana then you help to support terrorists but that wouldn't be true if the government was taxing it you know if it was legal then terrorists wouldn't be getting any of the money so 

233.98 236.00 B: absolutely the thing that i 

236.56 240.69 B: definitely wanna comment on is you see all these drug raids 

240.99 245.53 B: and the street value of the drugs that they confiscate and everything 

245.50 246.55 A: right 

245.88 249.71 B: but nobody has any idea how much 

249.78 251.26 B: slips through 

252.21 253.65 A: oh this is true 

252.50 258.26 B: that that they [sigh] don't know anything about it could be it could be 

256.45 259.32 A: yeah i heard somewhere that 

259.52 261.23 A: uh can you hear me 

261.08 262.32 B: yes i can 

262.28 269.61 A: i heard somewhere that at at the border of mexico they catch maybe one out of five every five and one out of every ten packages drug packages going through 

269.74 271.45 B: that's what i was going to say 

271.48 272.92 B: i think [sigh] 

273.73 280.73 B: the amount that gets past without being caught could be four five six seven maybe ten times 

281.17 282.98 B: what they confiscate 

283.18 285.66 A: right definitely true 

284.48 285.19 B: (( bec- )) 

285.26 288.64 B: because i lived in florida for a few years 

288.54 289.45 A: uh-huh 

289.61 291.36 B: and there of course 

293.03 295.44 B: even more drugs coming in [sigh] 

295.93 297.03 A: mhm 

296.41 298.36 B: by water than [sigh] 

299.40 301.81 B: here and so on plus they cl- 

299.67 300.66 A: right 

302.41 306.28 B: closed down an airstrip that was mainly used as a drug running 

306.56 308.92 A: yeah and it's pretty ludicrous that uh 

309.99 324.42 A: that teachers that grow grow a little bit of plants in their back yard you know they i mean they they're law abiding citizens they're they're doing federal jail time three to five years you know just cause they had a couple of marijuana plants you know they wanted to make a little extra money 

316.07 316.63 B: (( mm )) 

324.27 325.46 B: yes 

325.96 334.99 A: i mean i thi- think they're cracking on kinda harsh on that as far as uh illegal subjects uh what do you think about um the whole thing with uh 

335.67 337.26 A: like uh music 

337.62 338.57 B: with what 

337.79 338.84 A: was 

339.36 340.80 A: like m._p. threes 

341.58 343.75 A: there's a big uh controversy over 

344.60 350.35 A: uh artists not getting the royalty fees and people buying off c._d.s and things like that 

350.59 353.50 B: that i that i really 

351.01 352.11 A: (( can you hear me )) 

354.47 357.26 B: [sigh] i'm very unfamiliar with [sigh] 

356.84 357.68 A: uh-huh 

358.57 361.31 B: don't know anything about the uh [sigh] 

361.78 364.84 B: what are they doing making illegal c._d.s 

362.14 363.29 A: (( i see )) 

364.95 372.75 A: right uh basically they're files you yourself you can download just about any song you want for free and play it on your computer 

365.57 366.59 B: copies 

372.44 376.09 B: oh okay i'm kind of let's say i'm very u- 

372.83 373.46 A: (( y- )) 

375.18 377.90 A: and you can burn them onto c._d.s as well 

377.32 381.20 B: i'm not familiar with that whatsoever i do not have a computer 

381.05 382.27 A: i see 

382.87 383.92 B: (( so that's [laughter] )) 

384.51 386.44 B: that i really have no [sigh] 

388.19 391.47 B: no hard opinion on [sigh] or no opinion 

390.34 394.30 A: mhm what do you think about the whole situation in iraq how 

394.31 395.12 A: uh 

395.99 408.13 A: the president we- we're spending billions of dollars occupying them and because no other a lot of other countries didn't wanna didn't back us into war they don't wanna back us now in our uh the occupation in you know 

409.60 412.63 A: the uh transition of government 

413.18 419.20 B: well it's a proven fact so far that they sure didn't find any weapons of mass destruction 

417.14 419.07 A: yeah it's true 

419.31 421.43 A: they haven't found anything so far 

419.56 420.82 B: and so on 

421.72 424.54 B: but [mn] we are now there 

424.72 428.46 A: mhm we're spending billions of dollars too 

424.86 427.36 B: and there's no 

427.88 431.69 B: and they're yeah absolutely but there is no way they can get out 

431.89 433.63 A: right 

434.27 435.44 A: yeah so 

434.70 436.11 B: without being 

438.04 440.31 B: even more severely [sigh] 

438.10 439.90 A: (( and maybe )) 

440.86 442.05 B: criticized 

441.02 451.27 A: and they're doing terrorist attacks on them to- as well right now the the iraqis that are still far out they're doing terrorist attacks on u._s. soldiers you know that are just there to try to keep the peace 

448.53 449.58 B: yes 

452.02 462.30 A: i mean i definitely think going in to it was good that they got saddam out but it was if there was no oil there you wouldn't hear about it basically 

456.83 457.49 B: (( so )) 

462.47 465.17 B: this is absolutely correct 

465.78 472.33 B: wh- what would you suggest now for the united states to do there since they are there and in the position that they are 

473.20 476.87 A: i i think they should just keep doing what they're do- [laughter] 

477.12 483.41 A: for i mean eventually i think something will turn up this they did say they had some other pl- uh plutonium 

484.18 489.03 A: from one of the plants was missing enough to make nuclear weapons but i mean the 

489.50 495.23 A: this you know it's not hard it's not hard facts until you actual- actually find the weapons so 

496.92 501.45 A: and i mean they also could have destroyed all the weapons before they we came in there so 

501.79 503.88 A: i don't know it's a tough call 

503.45 505.01 B: yes they could've 

504.98 507.22 A: (( i'm glad i don't have to make that decision [laughter] )) 

506.72 511.65 B: [laughter] absolutely and and then they keep talking about north korea and the same 

511.71 513.67 A: yeah 

513.23 515.41 B: same context and [sigh] 

516.46 518.29 A: yeah north korea's 

518.70 520.55 A: it's kinda scary there 

520.77 524.84 A: if they if they do have nuclear weap- i believe they do have nuclear weapons so they're 

525.01 526.37 A: they're another threat 

527.69 529.25 B: it [sigh] 

529.57 535.22 B: well comes down to the point of whether [sigh] whether you believe the united states 

535.62 537.37 B: government in their 

539.01 541.08 B: c._i._a. and everything [sigh] 

540.91 541.99 A: right 

541.28 543.28 B: intelligence reports 

543.72 549.66 A: well after nine eleven the c._i._a. were pretty stupid i think because they had a lot of it 

544.24 545.06 B: which 

546.31 548.53 B: yes which which proved 

549.13 555.06 B: which proved to be incorrect with the so far with the mass weapons of mass destruction in iraq 

554.97 556.09 A: right 

555.51 556.65 B: and now 

557.54 559.54 B: does north korea have 

559.93 562.66 B: nuclear weapons or don't they 

562.62 572.05 A: mhm it's definitely gonna affect the next the upcoming presidential race how bush performs well you know if he performs well in the next year or so 

574.89 575.97 B: and or course 

577.40 579.13 B: the democrats [sigh] 

580.19 582.16 B: everybody wants to run 

582.44 585.29 A: yeah they they don't have a strong clear candidate 

584.49 587.41 B: and they have no no leader no 

588.02 595.18 A: i've heard uh i've heard hilary wants to run i personally don't wouldn't would not like to see her as the president 

595.45 599.01 A: i think she's pretty i mean she's competent but i think she's pretty selfish
