4.33 6.58 B: hey richard i'm down in los angeles 

6.15 7.40 A: (( oh cool )) 

6.89 15.51 B: i used to live up in vancouver so i bet the whole topic of activities is very different up where you are than when uh where i am [laughter] 

9.03 10.45 A: really 

12.21 13.51 A: yeah i used 

14.37 16.27 A: (( i used to live in hills )) 

16.05 17.74 B: (( oh yeah )) 

17.04 20.96 A: yeah um well uh shoot what do you think 

20.30 25.08 B: well i think that might as well talk about what they've asked us to talk about i um [lipsmack] 

24.51 27.59 A: (( yeah )) 

25.65 36.02 B: i certainly have different activities when i lived in vancouver because just it's it's cleaner it's more natural there's a lot of hiking there was a lot of walking a lot of biking and is it the sort of stuff that you do in seattle 

28.29 29.59 A: yeah 

31.82 34.95 A: yeah okay 

36.48 37.65 B: what do you like to do 

36.88 39.26 A: um i'm not an outdoors person 

38.71 39.67 B: okay 

39.64 48.91 A: but um there's a lot of culture here for you know there's the rep and there's all kinds of theatre and the opera and [cough] so it you don't want for culture 

48.90 60.95 B: that's good yeah i i'm finding there actually is culture here you have to really look for it but it's here [laughter] the orminson theatre they have a lot of national touring shows and stuff so i went to see lily tomlin so that's an activity i guess and [mn] 

53.00 54.01 A: really 

59.83 61.20 A: okay 

60.92 69.36 B: um i also like things like scrabble and i i guess they they wanted indoor and outdoor activities so that's certainly an activity 

67.16 68.14 A: yes 

69.88 75.14 A: well [sigh] the the good thing is you know because there there is a lot of culture here 

75.25 80.12 A: because of uh and like where i live there's a library within walking distance 

80.46 81.57 A: and then 

81.86 86.34 A: um [sigh] you know seattle's a big enough city 

86.47 92.85 A: that you don't have to you know feel deprived and uh well i been thinking maybe there would be you know 

89.29 90.81 B: (( [lipsmack] mhm )) 

93.22 97.66 A: i just think l._a. there'd be a hundred times more than what i uh have here 

97.01 106.34 B: oh well there's definitely tons to do but i think part of the uh challenge of finding these activities is just the city is so spread out um people often get so tired of the driving 

98.67 99.63 A: okay 

106.30 107.58 A: yeah 

106.31 112.79 B: outside they just wanna concentrate on whatever's in their own area for the most part and if they go out it's a big deal uh 

112.53 113.62 A: okay 

113.12 118.75 B: however um in the summer time the um [sigh] [lipsmack] the hollywood bowl have you ever heard of that 

118.14 119.20 A: (( yes okay )) 

118.90 125.01 B: yeah that is great cause you you really don't even feel like you're in the city you're sitting outside you can have a picnic and 

124.98 137.92 B: enjoying whatever's was whatever's on there they've a- all sorts of different concerts and a lot of really inexpensive tickets too they uh i- it's owned by the i believe it's owned by the city of los angeles so so the tickets are like five dollars 

137.31 138.69 A: all right 

137.96 146.96 B: so you can go in there and go amped at the top and and the sound system's great so you can hear just as well as in the front row you might need binoculars to see the the stage but [laughter] 

146.80 148.01 A: all right 

147.28 152.96 B: it's still w- actually it's one of my most enjoyable activities in los angeles is going to the hollywood bowl 

152.42 153.63 A: oh 

154.32 161.94 A: and i know here sports wise you know there's field and uh [sigh] so sport uh football and baseball are big here 

161.20 162.76 B: do you do that much 

162.45 174.65 A: um no because it's not w- you know i'm not interested enough and i don't wanna i'd rather spend my money on and i have such little time i'd ha- i'd rather spend my money and time on things that really i'm interested in 

174.37 175.58 B: well of course 

175.17 176.55 A: yeah 

175.92 182.24 B: yeah there's all sorts of activities that uh there are available for us but we don't wanna do the stuff we're not interested in 

182.34 184.86 A: and there's a lot of you know here 

184.88 189.73 A: [sigh] it's kinda more successful in in l._a. because uh here there are a lot of 

190.40 199.13 A: student things and a lot of um [lipsmack] smaller theatres that you can go to that are really really very inexpensive 

199.55 209.40 B: well we have a lot of comedy clubs too and that's fun to do i i live fairly close to the second city it's a tr- it's a training company for comedy actors so they they always have a lot of different shows 

201.59 203.34 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

204.69 206.48 A: okay okay 

209.51 217.71 B: the other night i went to a show there uh it w- it had dan i don't know how to say his last name castenella i think from the simpsons 

217.44 218.62 A: okay 

218.01 224.72 B: he's homer simpson and they were they had old movies that they were showing and they would lip synch new dialogue to it 

224.76 226.18 A: oh 

225.49 226.90 B: which was a lot of fun 

227.19 229.81 B: and five dollars [laughter] what a deal 

227.32 228.36 A: oh 

230.43 231.64 A: really 

231.23 236.94 B: yeah there's a lot of these underground things here you just sort of have to find out about 

231.80 232.94 A: wow 

236.52 237.99 A: (( oh okay )) 

238.41 239.78 A: [cough] but no i 

240.38 241.42 A: cause in 

241.65 248.58 A: [sigh] in college i was a you know a double major i was a psych and music major so i'm very [laughter] culture oriented 

246.61 247.48 B: (( mm )) 

248.41 250.78 B: yeah i was a music major too i played french horn 

250.60 253.09 A: oh really wow 

251.50 252.67 B: yeah 

253.73 256.53 A: uh i went to pacific in tacoma 

255.93 257.55 B: mhm 

256.67 259.39 A: and [sigh] so i'm very interested 

259.40 264.96 A: in the arts and i even though now music is still is is a hobby i take it real seriously 

264.59 267.30 B: do you ever get to see any outdoor concerts 

267.10 268.91 A: um [sigh] 

268.95 270.76 A: they're here but uh 

272.12 279.10 A: uh where they are here it's it's at the eastern s- uh east eastern side of the mountains 

278.90 280.32 B: so it's a little far for you 

279.25 282.67 A: where well i- it's not so much the distance it's the heat 

282.85 286.65 B: yeah boy compared to here it must be a lot cooler but um 

282.91 283.83 A: you know 

286.47 289.67 A: well we have our hot days like today it's gonna be like ninety 

289.17 290.09 B: (( mm )) 

289.77 293.22 A: but it's not that intense horrible heat that i remember 

292.61 294.23 B: (( [mn] w- )) 

293.33 295.12 A: from hills 

294.36 303.67 B: i think that definitely restricts my outdoor activities cause i as i said in yeah i'm i'm not attuned to the heat at all i don't know if it's just my body or living in canada for so long but 

297.43 298.73 A: the heat 

303.64 317.71 B: i would always get outside in in vancouver always be hiking as i said and biking but here i just don't as much cause it's just too oppressive in the summertime especially but it's nice cause at night it cools off cause it's a desert so i i tend to get out more at night 

315.53 316.44 A: [laughter] 

317.56 320.14 A: yeah it does cool off a a little doesn't it 

319.92 328.30 B: quite a bit usually um even if it's a really hot day and i'm say i'm at the hollywood bowl and you know you might even need a jacket at night 

320.94 322.46 A: as i remember 

323.47 324.40 A: (( okay )) 

327.66 329.00 A: really 

328.41 330.01 B: pretty amazing 

329.48 330.64 A: wow 

330.42 333.22 B: so what sort of indoor things do you enjoy doing 

332.96 335.86 A: shoot um well like i said 

336.03 349.93 A: i'm thinking of going back to school so i really like going to the library and research and you know going back to school is is something i really en- i like the times when i've had to study and a- and stuff like that so 

349.62 352.72 B: do you have any hobbies or anything that you do for fun indoors 

351.87 353.26 A: well i um 

353.86 359.23 A: [lipsmack] i still play the piano and so the piano is is quite a serious hobby with me 

358.70 362.46 B: that's an activity that that fits the topic [laughter] 

361.29 370.64 A: right and yeah and it's uh you know and i get when i do it i i get paid so i- it's you know the best of both worlds i enjoy it and i keep in practice 

366.16 368.02 B: oh great 

370.75 374.51 A: boy the french horn is something i had wish i had taken up 

374.31 386.09 B: well i wish i still played it but i don't anymore i have i had to cause i had a hernia problem with m- my stomach and i can no l- no longer support it you know physically i can't do it anymore 

376.58 378.60 A: (( oh you let it go cause i thought )) 

379.32 380.61 A: oh 

382.80 383.97 A: oh 

385.56 393.58 A: but so i shoot sometimes i still play for a ballet company and i always play for church or something when they ask me 

393.55 397.12 B: well sounds like you're involved in a lot of different things that's great 

393.69 394.66 A: and so 

396.88 402.42 A: well i would s- if it weren't for the heat i would still might seriously think about living 

402.53 405.64 A: where you are but that heat is just too intense 

405.46 419.78 B: well i find i i think my activities would be even more restricted if i lived in a place like say phoenix or las vegas and i had gone to palm springs on july forth weekend last year that was a big mistake [laughter] we um uh it was a hundred and twenty degrees uh 

410.78 412.10 A: oh gosh yeah 

416.55 417.73 A: was it hot 

419.03 420.15 A: oh no 

419.79 427.52 B: it was one of the hottest days they'd had and uh i just found that i we ended up going to a movie because it was so oppressive so uh 

426.71 428.22 A: really 

427.89 429.82 B: we had to deal with all the uh 

429.87 433.39 B: you know the heat so we just stayed in the air conditioning [laughter] even 

432.40 434.86 A: i can't imagine a hundred and twenty yeah 

434.13 448.77 B: well even a swim in the pool it wasn't even enjoyable i just i think the summer season is a slow season there cause people just can't partake in any activities um although there is one great thing in in palm springs to do that's fun outdoors um there's a tram that goes up a mountain 

448.37 449.63 A: oh 

449.13 452.88 B: and it's way cooler up there in and i went up there to hike one day 

450.83 451.87 A: oh 

452.85 454.34 A: oh 

454.61 455.71 A: wow 

456.53 459.73 A: i can't imagine anything cool in arizona 

459.40 463.27 B: oh well it was it's california palm springs in the in the desert 

462.02 465.26 A: oh that's right you said palm springs i was hearing arizona i'm sorry 

463.28 469.30 B: yeah no but uh c- altitude of course is cooler you know when you go higher 

468.16 469.61 A: okay okay 

469.48 471.34 B: the air's a little thinner but it's okay 

472.00 482.56 B: so yeah it's it's a shame cause i think if there was less pollution and the con- the climate were more temperate we'd all be doing a lot more outdoor activities cause it's it's nice to get out into nature 

472.04 473.10 A: but 

483.01 485.02 A: [sigh] well i'm not 

483.61 487.84 B: at least for me it is you might not be into that but that's kinda my thing 

486.83 489.38 A: i'm not an outdoorsy person at all 

489.65 493.27 A: you know like i have friends who are going camping do not invite me 

493.00 497.71 B: yeah i don't really enjoy that sort of activity either the camping is not really my thing 

497.11 498.11 A: i mean 

498.80 504.00 A: [sigh] anything below motel six is is is not well anything i'm interested in 

501.00 502.31 B: (( [laughter] )) 

503.67 514.84 B: well i kinda like a little bit of both you know i like doing the hiking during the day but i want i would wanna go back to a a shower and war- a nice warm clean bed at night i don't really like the idea of sleeping on the ground 

505.97 506.95 A: yeah 

513.78 524.36 A: [laughter] yeah the only thing i've ever done uh being at one with the snakes and all that no i'm not into that and i had a friend who had almost had a run in with a bear one time so no 

523.91 528.95 B: [noise] oh yeah yeah i used to live in banff alberta i don't know if you've heard of that place 

524.43 525.34 A: i don- 

527.93 529.28 A: yes 

528.91 542.94 B: really in the middle of the mountains there and um we'd go out and you've have like keys or or you'd make noise so that the bears would hear you and they don't wanna encounter you they don't wanna encounter you any more than you wanna encounter them so as long as you don't happen to separate them from their cubs 

539.18 540.55 A: oh okay 

542.46 543.64 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

542.92 556.07 B: you're fine if you do that then you're in trouble [laughter] cause if what if the what if the mother is on one side of the path and the cubs are on the other side of the path then she perceives that you're getting in between her and her kids and sh- she doesn't like that 

544.89 546.31 A: okay 

551.18 552.08 A: (( oh yeah )) 

555.77 561.77 A: um see yeah well i've lived in alaska for a while about six months and um [sigh] 

558.38 559.53 B: oh really 

562.38 565.04 A: [sigh] it was a very long six months 

564.99 569.40 B: what sort of activities could you do there was it all in is it was it wintertime or summer time 

566.75 567.46 A: (( [laughter] )) 

568.39 570.01 A: no it was it wa- 

570.37 578.13 A: um it was summer and so it was very t- very nice climate um but shoot talk about 

574.65 575.58 B: (( mm )) 

576.95 579.27 B: so what kinda things were you able to do there 

578.83 584.23 A: well activity wise y- there's a lot of drinking and i don't drink 

583.41 585.22 B: [laughter] 

584.31 586.92 A: but i found myself you know unless i was gonna be 

587.55 593.99 A: alone for like six months i would go into the bars because that's where all my friends were and one of the people i worked with were there 

594.03 597.37 A: and there's a high alcoholism rate there and i can see why 

597.05 599.91 B: mhm does it because it's lonely 

597.88 598.86 A: and that's
