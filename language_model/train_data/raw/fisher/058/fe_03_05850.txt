347.72 349.60 A: yeah 

348.42 351.86 B: know doing a workout exercise right here or little pull ups 

352.50 353.77 A: yep 

353.48 354.41 B: (( just cause ))

365.31 366.18 A: (( yeah [laughter] uh )) 

365.58 368.69 B: get away with it [laughter] you know 

369.16 383.83 B: yeah [lipsmack] so i mean it basically this is those are all the sports you know that i i i really play with but um i find it easier to breathe in the winter than in the summer when you play sports yeah breathing 

371.29 372.55 A: it's fun 

381.36 382.39 A: to breathe 

383.46 384.62 A: oh really 

384.21 388.61 B: yeah because in the summer like you always get outta breath right away when you're playing sports 

387.07 387.63 A: (( [cough] )) 

388.45 390.15 A: i have the opposite 

390.23 394.32 A: because i- in the winter i have asthma and i can't really breathe 

392.97 396.83 B: mm yeah you can't yeah you can't that's different yeah that's true 

396.80 400.98 A: and i so in the winter i have a hard time doing anything outside really 

400.91 408.33 B: in the winter i could do a lot of stuff but like in the summer it's because of the the heat and the sun you know just like coming down on you 

408.15 409.42 A: pounding yeah 

408.67 414.35 B: makes it a little harder you know to like breathing you're always outta air you're always like you drink too much water 

412.12 413.36 A: yeah 

415.16 417.74 B: where in the winter you don't really drink as much water 

418.18 419.59 B: (( when you play sports )) 

419.63 420.89 A: yeah 

420.28 422.01 B: take a little sip and that's it 

421.00 425.25 A: i think that's where you lose some weight in the summer cause you're drinking so much 

424.78 429.11 B: yeah you're sweating it out though e- everything you drink you sweat out right away immediately 

425.92 427.67 A: you're just so thirsty 

429.02 431.07 A: right right 

430.36 431.24 B: (( you know )) 

431.46 432.86 B: i try bowling 

432.99 436.72 B: in the winter in the winter [laughter] i tried it 

433.33 434.34 A: bowling 

436.54 441.75 A: uh that's one my least sports i can do least well

442.01 445.77 A: i cannot bowl for some reason i am not good at 

444.54 452.62 B: i mean i i i didn't do it because i wanted to i just did it because it was like cold and you wanna be indoors you know playing some type of sport you know 

449.53 450.43 A: yeah 

452.78 455.41 A: but there's no exercise in bowling really 

452.83 453.71 B: (( it takes )) 

454.61 459.34 B: not really i guess you just have to have a strong arm you know those balls weigh a little bit you know 

459.09 460.20 A: yeah 

459.58 461.25 B: they weigh pretty much so 

461.22 463.93 A: you're not getting much there as far as exercise 

462.51 465.75 B: you're not really getting much of an exercise but the thing is that 

465.00 467.22 A: it's fun it's just more of a 

465.82 468.87 B: it's fun you know you're just trying to knock down ten pins 

468.69 471.51 A: yeah kinda like pool 

471.30 477.45 B: yeah pool that's another that's another sport that's that uh not a sp- that's not even i don't even think they consider that a sport 

475.58 478.38 A: not even a sport it's a game really 

477.63 483.29 B: it's a game but that's good in the winter because you can go indoors anything that's indoors is good for the winter

500.56 502.64 B: it gets hot it's gets hot 

502.65 505.39 B: because everybody's breathing that same air from the ventilator 

505.32 506.86 A: right 

506.51 508.01 B: (( so it's really not you know )) 

507.11 510.80 A: like basketball or something indoors it it's a killer 

509.23 510.25 B: oh no
