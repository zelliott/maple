100.06 100.67 B: (( yeah )) 

100.52 102.42 A: ah keep you out of 

102.68 103.68 A: i guess 

103.70 105.99 A: situations that maybe you know come 

105.05 110.90 B: of course along with that is the responsibility for you to keep your family out of situations and to make sure 

109.83 111.41 A: yeah yes 

111.08 113.71 B: (( you know it's a two way street )) 

112.60 114.52 A: (( mhm um )) 

114.78 117.62 A: so it's k- yeah i see what you're saying 

117.91 119.10 A: um 

118.62 121.42 B: so along with family comes a lot of responsibilities 

121.49 123.36 A: (( uh-huh ah )) 

123.50 126.99 A: the the thing you were talking about tradition 

126.89 128.67 B: mhm 

127.08 128.04 A: um 

128.08 129.33 A: i don't know 

129.63 131.85 A: i i know what you're saying but um 

132.48 135.69 A: are you talking about like it could be anything like 

135.15 147.36 B: well what i what specifically what i meant was every family has their own traditions their own customs their own ways of doing things their own ways of living life and dating back to 

144.50 145.37 A: uh-huh 

148.07 157.70 B: whenever [laughter] i mean i don't know what your religious believes are i guess but back to the beginning our society has thrived and advanced based on 

153.36 154.19 A: mhm 

157.80 167.11 B: family values traditions and different cultural beliefs being passed down from one generation to the next obviously in today's day in society 

163.67 165.00 A: mhm 

167.21 170.24 B: it's been devalued by 

170.25 179.65 B: the advances in the educational system and different medias between newspapers television the internet whatever else 

179.51 180.94 A: mhm 

180.34 188.61 B: but ah at it's core you don't trust anybody near as much as you trust your own family at least in most cases in this country 

187.38 188.28 A: (( yeah )) 

188.90 194.72 B: and because of that you rely on them to teach you certain things when you're younger 

193.34 194.92 A: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

195.33 198.09 A: and that's how you turn out as a person 

198.25 199.93 A: (( you hope right )) 

198.36 204.47 B: well nature versus nurture i guess it is [laughter] what it boils down to but that's a that's a whole different ah discussion 

202.08 202.86 A: mhm 

205.55 207.04 A: (( ah they ah )) 

207.05 209.75 A: firstly my family ah 

209.92 210.83 A: you know 

210.85 215.60 A: brought brought me up into the ah christian faith 

215.48 216.93 B: mhm 

216.01 217.14 A: so 

217.38 224.56 A: and you know a lot of the values and yeah you're right morals you know and um 

225.08 225.97 A: (( ah mhm )) 

225.25 233.59 B: ex- exactly i mean that's your that's your family upbringing that brought you to that particular place in life me personally i was brought up jewish 

233.43 234.64 A: mhm 

234.11 243.78 B: and because of that you know or with i should say without that you and i could have been brought up with the exact opposites you know 

243.13 244.46 A: yeah yeah 

243.81 248.91 B: and if your family was not christian you probably would not have been been brought up christian 

248.88 249.85 A: exactly 

248.95 252.80 B: just as i would not [laughter] have been brought up jewish if my family was not jewish 

252.10 254.91 A: are you still jewish jewish sorry 

253.76 254.76 B: yes 

255.32 257.06 A: are you still remain jew 

257.01 258.00 B: of course 

257.84 258.91 A: y- okay 

259.30 261.34 A: and you said you live in new york 

260.81 262.47 B: (( mhm [mn] manhattan )) 

262.97 264.48 A: (( um [mn] what )) 

264.62 267.92 A: (( was i going to say say sorry about that ah )) 

269.68 271.14 A: yeah um 

271.23 275.78 A: and also it also ah i guess would do you think it affects like your 

275.81 280.78 A: maybe your job status like what you're going to like 

280.13 284.64 B: i think i i think and it i think it ties in with everything in your life 

284.16 285.08 A: mhm 

284.51 295.95 B: for example my entire life i watched my i i watched my dad go to work every day come home basically never call in sick you know always do what he had to do 

295.82 296.72 A: uh-huh 

296.43 298.78 B: and and as a result 

298.94 303.43 B: you know i've always strived to obtain that same work ethic 

303.30 304.26 A: mhm 

303.65 305.69 B: as my father did because 

306.08 319.89 B: if for no other reason i i thought it was i i i always thought it was kind of amazing when when people would say to him other family members or friends of his when i was around and younger would say to him oh why don't you just take a sick day and we'll go off and do this and he was like 

316.15 316.98 A: (( yeah )) 

319.85 322.28 B: and his response to them would always be 

322.71 325.19 B: i haven't taken a sick day in ten years 

325.14 326.00 A: (( yeah )) 

325.21 327.28 B: you know or 

327.71 337.53 B: [mn] when somebody would call and ask him for something if he if it was in his power he would go ahead and do it so this is what i grew up seeing and watching and as a result 

337.68 340.78 B: a lot of that rubbed off on me 

340.08 346.75 A: uh-huh and you ah so i take it that you've got a really good work ethic and everything right 

346.46 347.46 B: i try ah 

347.48 353.11 A: you i mean it sounds like that's what i've taken [laughter] you know from this ah 

353.27 358.93 A: yeah it sounds so it sounds like you ah you were brought up you know work hard right and kind of 

358.04 360.23 B: yes without a doubt 

359.25 360.76 A: yeah without okay 

360.88 365.40 A: and and where did you say you you lived in new york the 

364.46 365.56 B: (( in manhattan ))

376.80 377.82 A: okay 

377.96 380.90 A: so [laughter] he's nuclear medicine 

378.06 383.45 B: i'm in business two completely different avenues but it's it's more the ah 

383.77 385.88 B: what what i was getting at was more the 

386.08 391.29 B: the part that was passed down wasn't necessarily like a trade it's not like it's not like we're going back to 

391.20 396.31 B: to the to the early nineteen hundreds and the eighteen hundreds and the seventeen hundreds where you know if you were 

396.23 408.25 B: if you were a blacksmith and you you passed that down you know more the type of thing were just the lifestyle that he led and the way that he did things is what was passed on to me 

399.48 400.61 A: mhm 

406.06 406.98 A: (( yeah )) 

409.02 410.03 A: (( um )) 

410.37 415.18 A: my parents and it'd be i guess it'd be my dad and my ah 

415.58 422.12 A: grandpa they were brought up there there jobs were um you know professions i guess were 

422.13 425.56 A: ah were in the logging industry 

425.03 426.81 B: mhm 

425.77 428.66 A: and because it was in the logging industry we were 

428.74 431.35 A: kind of you know ah 

431.81 433.66 A: pr- ah pro 

433.81 440.78 A: you know w- you know sometimes when you you hear about the jobs being lost at the mills just ah 

440.83 447.70 A: that affects us and we we you know we we've been we've been a lot you know we've 

440.85 442.05 B: right 

447.84 449.80 A: we've ah what 

449.67 452.60 B: obviously it's been passed down through a lot of generations 

449.82 450.98 A: i'm trying to get at 

452.59 454.39 A: uh-huh exactly 

454.40 456.21 A: so we when 

456.10 469.78 A: when all we can see our jobs have been affected through it and i don't know if this is what happened to the family but see what i'm saying i if my family wasn't logging maybe it wouldn't ah you know i was brought up with logging and all as a 

459.40 461.11 B: mhm 

468.78 470.47 B: right 

470.07 472.03 A: [mn] i guess as a career or whatever 

472.08 480.75 A: ah then probably ah this the you know the environment and all that stuff would not be as big of an issue 

480.72 487.73 A: you know what i'm saying but because it's a job to try to you know that was there that's their way of life i guess 

481.48 483.26 B: mhm 

489.03 492.62 B: right and i'm and i'm sure these were these were things that were passed down to you 

489.24 490.15 A: oh 

492.58 495.61 A: mhm ah no personally i'm not [laughter] 

495.04 502.75 B: i i'm not saying i'm not saying the career was passed down to you but i'm sure that a lot of those values were passed down to you 'cause that's what you grew up with 

500.63 501.43 A: mhm 

502.10 504.07 A: (( exactly um )) 

503.49 512.06 B: i mean one of the best ah ah descriptions of what i think the greatest family values is that i've ever heard 

511.50 512.39 A: uh-huh 

512.01 526.38 B: was a very close family friend he ah i don't know if they have anyone my age or at least i don't really know them but my grandmother's best friend happens to be wealthy beyond any imagination 

521.00 522.31 A: mhm 

526.09 527.10 A: yes 

527.05 532.01 B: ah we're talking multiple millions she had three children 

532.09 534.66 B: out of ah each of these three children 

535.04 545.35 B: although they were given everything that was necessary i mean they always had a roof over their head there was always food on the table clothes on their back books on their desks so forth and so forth 

545.05 546.31 A: mhm 

545.99 550.10 B: and she believed in raising them that she didn't want to spoil them 

549.84 550.98 A: exactly 

550.43 557.67 B: as the result they each of them had to buy their own cars their own first cars this is just one small example 

557.32 558.62 A: mhm 

558.08 559.54 B: the oldest one 

559.66 562.43 B: all he could afford at at the time was a hearse 

562.57 563.88 A: mhm 

564.27 573.25 B: the son of this ah the son of these multi million ah multi millionaires was driving around in a hearse and now today these these three children 

569.20 570.11 A: (( uh-huh )) 

573.38 579.98 B: one's a gemologist and two are doctors and they're all millionaires in their own right with families of their own 

577.12 578.86 A: (( they made it good um themselves )) 

580.04 581.20 B: and it 

581.25 584.84 B: and and it just kind of in a way goes to show you how 

585.43 592.94 B: even if even if your family has everything or has nothing it's more a matter of the values in which you are brought up on 

588.75 589.68 A: uh-huh 

593.83 597.20 B: that kind of molds you into the person that you become 

597.98 599.89 B: obviously there are exceptions there
