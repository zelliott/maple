132.98 134.02 B: right 

134.66 136.66 A: my parents never said 

136.86 147.02 A: don't you can't do it they just said 'cause 'cause seeing as my dad grew up in the depression it's like of course he has a whole different way of looking at things it's like that's not secure 

146.93 152.23 A: and it's not secure in general anyways but especially for someone who grew up in a time when 

152.40 155.55 A: like it is now but even worse maybe but um 

156.76 158.80 A: you know so of course 

159.46 174.12 A: i am not like i don't know at least some people at least i'm dealing with people from a lot of cultures in my job so and i find that they whatever their parents say goes even up to the point when they're like in their twenties and thirties 

173.53 185.82 B: right well that's that's that's not really a family tour for me that's more like you know a [mn] not a role figure anymore not a role model it's more like i'm the commanding presence you know do what i say regardless of what you think 

177.44 178.32 A: yeah 

180.47 181.31 A: huh 

184.88 186.88 A: [laughter] yeah 

185.93 195.11 B: with my family it's my parents you know supported me in whatever i chose to do they you know opened me to a wide variety of items different things i could do different sports 

193.15 194.96 A: yeah 

195.10 203.02 B: activities it wasn't you're you're going to do piano lessons and play the violin after school i don't give a shit what you want to do this is what we want you to do 

195.26 196.46 A: yeah 

199.20 200.11 A: [laughter] 

201.40 204.54 A: [laughter] yeah 

203.16 206.88 B: no family was they supported you in whatever you chose to do 

206.85 211.68 A: yeah as long as it was something that would keep you afloat [laughter] 

208.37 209.30 B: i mean 

211.31 224.76 B: pretty much right but i mean they even let me fail just like in you know instead of saying well you know that's not s- s- so tell me however the hell life goes they'd rather have like let me find myself for myself and family if your family doesn't do that 

214.20 215.91 A: yeah 

222.43 223.65 A: yeah 

224.83 234.68 B: then w- well then what are they really there for what are they ah i mean w- what's their point i mean yeah great that they're to support you and everything but if w- what do you need support for if they're going to tell you everything 

228.81 230.56 A: yeah 

234.72 235.49 A: uh-huh 

235.61 247.82 A: well you know ah the way i look at my family is the parameters are different like when my parents were growing up 'cause my dad did grow up in the depression and they're both like in their eighties and seventies now 

247.86 259.44 A: and the thing is it's like there's different variables and a whole different environment we're dealing with i mean things were a little less complex back then i think now that 

257.63 263.84 B: right they didn't have so much going on they had you know here's your standard family values kind of like you know the fifties of 

263.62 273.60 B: here's what family is dad comes home from work mom's got the t- ah t- ah dinner ready on the table you know that whole mind set has been totally destroyed and in today's world you know 

268.79 269.68 A: yeah 

271.44 274.22 A: (( right and and )) 

273.63 278.61 B: your wife or mother or whatever might be you know the one making the money and you're the one sitting home doing the cooking 

278.47 279.71 A: right 

279.19 281.99 B: i mean the whole entire role reversal is switched 

281.46 292.13 A: and also the idea of in their time like my parents time is like you've got a job and you stuck with that job for your life now it's like you've got to learn ten dif- 

288.10 288.94 B: right 

289.31 290.12 B: right 

290.50 292.11 B: you don't like it move on 

292.32 299.17 A: yeah you've got to learn ten different skills or you're not going to you know but the world's going to change and you're not you know but ah 

298.13 299.94 B: (( you're going to be stuck behind )) 

300.39 312.26 B: yeah but i mean family that you know they're they're to s- you know to help you through that you know to help you ah like you know i just pretty much i'm i'm not working right now and my family's you know kind of helping me right now you know pay the bills and whatever because 

300.39 301.71 A: yeah 

303.93 305.08 A: yeah 

308.16 309.02 A: okay 

310.60 311.57 A: oh 

312.01 313.91 A: that's good 

312.22 317.85 B: i still haven't found a job since i just moved so you know they're they're just you know to help you out when you need it and you know 

314.34 316.32 A: yeah 

317.69 319.72 A: yeah 

318.75 323.87 B: pretty much like to be ah what is what's the word i ah like a lighthouse in the storm 

323.43 328.07 A: [laughter] yeah i've i've i've i mean i got to admit i've i've 

328.32 337.92 A: i've gone a a little overboard on that i think in terms of like how much i've i like money and stuff like i'm tired of 

335.80 336.80 B: (( mm )) 

337.81 344.12 A: um it's been rocky in new york as you probably know the economy here i mean the employment rate this year is just ah 

341.23 342.15 B: right 

344.46 346.27 A: (( ah you know like a )) 

346.73 348.53 A: just the worst 

346.79 349.46 B: it's it's an all time high yeah 

348.88 350.52 A: yeah but um 

351.62 358.90 A: one thing i can say is if if i didn't have my parents didn't show me like and you know like 

358.74 372.74 A: the arts when i was young then i wouldn't have i don't i don't feel i feel like they showed me that by the way just to say okay this is it it's for you if you want it here it here it is they didn't ever say i'm taking you to this opera or you're going to this classical concert 

367.44 368.43 B: right 

372.15 385.22 B: they gave you an option to s- you know to culture yourself it wasn't you know like i said really they're not going to force you to you know all right you're taking the you're taking you know piano lessons after school it's you choose what you want to do with your life they don't choose it for you 

374.58 376.21 A: (( yeah )) 

383.18 389.85 A: yeah but at the same time they did want they did try and instill in my like you know why don't you just 

391.08 396.43 A: [pause] like is going to be a solid field to go into you know 

395.09 398.48 B: right they they they steer you they don't drive you 

397.26 399.08 A: yeah 

398.96 399.99 B: they could be 

399.14 411.09 A: but then again there was a rigidity too there was [laughter] i mean it's growing up in a roman catholic family half time half hours is like oh my god if my parents were both taurus's so they if you get into horoscope then it's like 

408.42 409.43 B: right 

410.29 412.31 B: i understand completely don't worry 

411.61 413.74 A: well you know what i'm saying but ah 

414.72 425.96 A: you know as far as it goes i i i sometimes wish like for example the first time i think all my brothers will be together like my mother got married once and i have another brother ah 

425.91 436.26 A: like we may all just be together for the first time in years like you know i guess like the whole family like my brother his son and then my other brother who's older 

430.58 431.46 B: right 

436.28 438.05 A: it's pretty cool you know we're 

437.46 439.50 B: right i 

438.64 439.62 A: jewish 

441.13 456.09 A: [pause] gotten together at least you're just i think affirmation like okay we're we're still here we're still alive we're we're not you know no ones no ones ah addicted to heroin no one's dead no one's committed suicide [laughter] [laughter] 

454.15 462.22 B: right i mean the last time i think i've seen my entire family you know my brothers my parents ah i've got my fiancee now ah 

460.92 462.56 A: (( i mean oh nice )) 

462.25 464.54 B: ah what is it oh thank you 

462.69 464.32 A: good luck there 

464.55 469.88 B: ah you know my entire family was probably you know before i met her seven years ago 

469.87 470.70 A: uh-huh 

470.05 472.34 B: six years ago even way before i met her 

472.35 481.13 B: and that was probably the last time i've seen them all it's like yeah so you know probably a third of my cousins i haven't last time i've seen all my cousins was when i was five 

480.09 482.03 A: (( mhm )) 

481.37 483.34 B: and they were in their twenties 

483.05 490.93 A: yeah yeah yeah i've got a question it it's regarding what we're doing now like how many times did they call you to do this like three or four times i mean i know 

484.58 485.43 B: so 

489.89 492.95 B: this is the first this is the first time i just emailed them today 

492.64 497.70 A: oh okay 'cause i've done this like three times already and i thought you're only supposed to do it three times 

497.28 502.11 B: hey who knows they said three or more they can call me anytime they want i need the money 

498.33 500.33 A: yeah oh 

501.58 504.35 A: [laughter] i got you man anyways 

504.45 505.57 A: um 

506.17 514.63 A: so yeah i guess if i'm a at this point in my life i'll just say that if i'm going to i'm going to f. up then i've got nobody to blame because i know 

506.31 507.08 B: (( [laughter] is it )) 

514.65 524.15 A: like at least they tried to like scare me and like anything i've done at this point 'cause i'm past my thirties like i'm in my thirties now i consider to be my own 

521.85 525.07 B: i figured as much by how you said how old your parents were 

525.01 534.16 A: yeah 'cause they had me like like my mother's her first husband died and then she got married again to my you know my biological father but um [mn] 

532.42 533.52 B: right 

534.63 538.10 A: but anyways yeah so i was going to say you know like 

538.54 542.50 A: family [sigh] i totally just what we were saying then [laughter] sorry 

541.53 543.31 B: (( don't worry about it don't worry about it )) 

542.82 543.78 A: (( um )) 

544.13 548.53 A: but anyways yeah that that's how i i look at things and i mean 

549.17 551.51 A: (( you know um i'm )) 

551.89 557.99 A: lucky i guess that i just had a family like i did even if they were hard core like my dad's hard core 'cause he was like a professor or so 

557.68 565.69 B: right i mean at at least i mean at least we both grew up with you know families around us that helped us through whatever we needed to there are people out there who don't really have a family anymore 

558.01 558.92 A: (( so i )) 

565.47 566.62 A: that's true 

565.71 571.54 B: or that chose not to have a family that chose to be you know all right screw you guys i'm fifteen i'm running away 

571.80 582.46 A: well what do you think about the concept of of of family about like as far as what's what's happening now with like same sex families and you know it's funny 'cause i 

580.37 581.47 B: (( yeah i )) 

581.61 590.43 B: have i have no issues with that whatsoever people can do what they want with their life it's their life i'm not going to you know try to say oh it's unethical it's not right 

585.42 587.14 A: yeah 

590.77 594.35 B: who said it's unethical by what book and by what standards
