17.44 27.97 B: yeah i am too uh but i guess if i had to choose one of the other um i guess i'd rather be a little warm than be like you know chilled to the bone freezing as far as i'm concerned

45.35 53.25 B: um but i guess as far as indoor or outdoor um i mean i don't really do like w- w- i i guess when i'm outdoors i don't really do 

53.46 64.69 B: that much except for just you know hang out outside with friends or whatever it's not like i do that many outdoor athletic activities mostly i'm more of an indoor gym kinda guy when it comes to indoor activities but 

64.01 70.86 A: uh see i like outdoor activities better but it's you know as you get as you get into a certain age bracket it's hard to find people to do 'em with 

70.52 72.34 B: that's true yeah

77.86 86.25 A: so you know that's you know and as far as winter sport i mean i love skiing snowboarding um so i i prefer outdoor activities much more than indoor activities 

82.02 82.81 B: mhm 

85.68 91.80 B: yeah cause for i i mean i have friends who go kayaking and they hike and they do all sorts of stuff but 

91.57 103.05 B: yeah for me mostly just to to keep in shape i pretty much go to the gym and um but when i'm outdoors you know i i'll walk just you know because i'm in new york city i you know i tend to do a lot of walking as it is so 

102.96 107.85 B: um just being out and about in new york city is kind of an outdoor activity in itself um 

107.16 110.59 A: yeah yeah s- m- me as well i roller blade everywhere so 

110.02 112.68 B: yeah yeah that's popular um 

112.04 114.06 A: yeah well it's an easy way to get around you know i 

113.49 115.16 B: right right 

114.49 117.98 A: don't have to worry about people stealing your roller blades as compared to the bike 

117.41 118.68 B: exactly 

118.74 119.85 B: um 

120.75 123.39 B: hm i trying to think of other other ways we can 

121.60 124.47 A: [laughter] can't beat this man get get paid to talk 

124.12 133.28 B: i'm trying to think of other ways we can discuss this issue [laughter] do you find it that it i mean have you lived i- in other places and has it changed your p- 

127.86 129.64 A: uh [sigh] let's s- 

132.64 135.08 A: yeah i lived in l._a. for like ten years 

134.78 138.79 B: and and is it pretty much the same as far as what you like to do out there 

138.05 143.98 A: no no uh l._a. is much much much more outdoor just for the simple fact that it's warm all year round 

143.32 144.90 B: right 

144.31 146.99 A: and you have geographical you know 

147.12 152.81 A: like your limitations are aren't as strict as they here because you have the beach and you have the mountains 

152.34 154.06 B: right right 

152.89 158.52 A: you know and and and you have the city so it's kinda like you know i'm with in with the climate being 

158.58 160.50 A: (( [lipsmack] you know temperate all year )) 

160.31 161.19 B: mhm 

160.77 167.35 A: you know you can basically do what you want like in in the winter you can actually i mean if you have a wet suit you can surf and then you can ski in the same day 

166.90 168.64 B: right right 

167.81 169.31 A: which is kinda cool 

169.04 169.94 B: cool 

170.86 179.12 A: [noise] but uh yeah i mean i you know i i prefer i prefer to be outside more so than inside as i'm sure most people do 

175.74 176.85 B: yeah 

178.77 180.12 B: right 

179.45 180.99 A: well maybe not maybe not 

180.58 181.86 B: [laughter] 

181.56 185.04 A: [laughter] come a lo- across a lot of people who don't even wanna leave their house uh 

181.97 183.12 B: (( uh i mean )) 

184.35 191.14 B: right like a- around here i guess do y- do you tend to go out to long island and stuff as far as you know getting out to the ocean more 

188.82 190.27 A: (( um )) 

191.98 196.77 A: you know what i really haven't i'm i'm i'm a little i'm new to the area so 

192.01 193.41 B: or or do you go 

193.66 194.69 B: (( yeah oh )) 

196.12 197.06 B: okay 

197.15 204.53 A: you know as far as i mean i i tend to go to more the jersey shore you know like avalon just just because i'm familiar with it 

201.34 202.20 B: okay 

204.20 205.50 B: yeah 

204.96 211.72 A: you know what i mean i'm not really familiar with the hamptons or you know how any part of that yet i mean i'm sure it will be i- in the coming seasons but 

208.79 210.09 B: right 

211.15 226.04 B: yeah well it's funny cause i'm i just t- two weeks ago a cousin of mine who's very outdoorsy and into hiking and biking and all sorts of outdoorsy stuff um he w- he was staying with me and so he kinda pushed the envelope a little bit with me in terms of what i like to do [laughter] so 

211.96 212.91 A: so now 

225.82 226.89 A: (( yeah )) 

225.83 229.96 B: that was good and so we ended up going out to long island and going out to fire island and just you know 

230.09 234.47 B: going to different national parks areas and stuff and so that was fun 

233.00 233.72 A: right 

234.84 238.18 A: yeah i just i really just haven't had the chance to venture out there yet 

237.67 240.31 B: yeah there's there's a lot to do [laughter] 

238.40 239.19 A: (( yeah )) 

239.94 241.60 A: yeah i hear i hear 

241.11 242.09 B: yeah 

241.63 245.47 A: just it just when you move to a new city i'm trying to get acclimated with everything 

244.79 246.19 B: right right 

245.36 258.21 A: you know i mean i've visited here plenty of times you know working and doing that but see i'm i am familiar with the areas it's just that you know a- as you get older you know your life become [laughter] seems like there's less hours in the day to do what you wanna do so 

248.28 249.74 B: mhm 

257.51 267.34 B: right no i i've been here for about four years now but i i just discovered this amazing park up at the top up at the up at the the top tip of manhattan uh it's uh 

267.17 269.70 B: around inwood it's uh before trian park 

269.49 273.01 B: and it's just it's beautiful up there it's like this kinda medieval 

269.71 270.65 A: oh really 

272.90 276.89 B: you you feel like you're in lord of the rings or something because i mean it's so wooded and just ev- 

276.89 291.45 B: just trees everywhere and you're kinda up in this hillside and you're looking down at the river and yet you don't see any big buildings or anything and and there's this there's this sort of medieval museum that's run by the met that that's up there also that's kind of a monastery of some sort but 

291.17 291.87 A: huh 

291.35 295.70 B: uh that's probably m- one of my top outdoor areas i've seen in new york city so far 

295.55 299.82 A: cool where wh- uh what train there's a six- oh nah does the six go up there 

299.25 306.08 B: you'd take no uh i think you'd wanna take um the a or the one nine up there and um 

304.63 308.25 A: oh the one nine it goes all the way up to like washington heights past there 

307.84 316.86 B: yeah i mean actually probably i guess if you took the a and but it's it's right around um like i guess the the top of the park is around dikeman avenue and then um 

317.08 323.20 B: but it- it's pretty obvious on the map if you look at the subway map how to get up there but but it's gorgeous up there it's really nice 

322.03 324.52 A: hm oh i definitely have to check that out 

324.31 325.34 B: um 

325.37 332.87 B: and th- there's a little cafe in the middle of the whole place but it but it there are just all sorts of old trails to walk around and stuff it's cool 

332.11 339.13 A: that's cool is it is it is it pretty safe cause i know once you start getting up to like washington heights and enwood it kinda gets a little sketchy in some areas 

338.00 347.56 B: oh i mean it- it's great i mean cause it's it's funny cause i in one area it's like all these sort of older people in this kinda peaceful area of the park just sitting around looking at the looking at nature and then 

347.41 361.53 B: um it's it's a lot of i mean it seems like a lot of younger folks i mean i i live in harlem right now actually um in fact i used to live in astoria but when i saw how how cheap the and and how huge the the places are in harlem then i i moved here two two years ago 

360.30 362.68 A: right right that's where i'm actually looking there 

362.20 364.04 B: okay yeah 

362.79 368.35 A: in that gen- in that general area just cause it's it's it's like a forth of the price of anywhere else 

367.74 380.64 B: completely yeah man and i have a place that right and and i have a place that's like twelve hundred square feet and um you know is th- three bedrooms and direct view to the river and and it's right by a big state park that's right across the way that's really nice um it's it's 

368.75 370.80 A: yeah and you're on the island 

379.51 381.34 A: uh can't beat that 

380.77 382.58 B: built out over the river a little bit 

382.60 388.54 B: and ther- there's a gym close by that's only a hundred and fifty bucks for the year and s- insan- insanely cheap 

388.21 389.09 A: (( really )) 

388.42 397.17 B: but uh but yeah so but up in this area it's like every week i see new people moving in and so i mean it- it's it's at the point where now i mean safety it's 

396.95 405.89 B: supposed to be i mean in in in in the daytime safety's not at all a concern um and even at night i mean i come home at three in the morning sometimes and it's i've never really felt unsafe at all 

400.13 400.91 A: right 

405.73 408.89 A: right yeah i mean it's it's a far cry from what it was twenty years ago 

408.29 409.75 B: yeah yeah 

408.98 420.55 A: just for the simple fact that manhattan's so expensive that everybody's [laughter] looking for you know the cheaper area to move to and you know and there's so many people in this city that [lipsmack] that you're just gonna you know that everybody's gonna flock you see you know rent for 

412.02 412.95 B: right 

414.42 415.21 B: right 

420.44 426.60 A: eight hundred dollars versus twenty four hundred dollars you're [laughter] you're going with the eight hundred i'll take my chances [laughter] 

422.99 424.66 B: yeah 

425.11 432.57 B: exactly okay here's an outdoor topic um in terms of like ocean temperature and stuff if you surf and all that um so i guess 

432.61 441.07 B: cause i was i was just out on fire island and uh mos- most people weren't even in the water cause it was so cold so i assume out west i mean it's probably pretty 

440.22 444.54 A: out west no out west out west the water's colder the pacific water's colder yeah 

442.83 444.90 B: oh it's colder oh wow 

444.68 446.50 A: yeah like the what it is 

446.54 455.30 A: since it hasn't been a a blistering summer here yet i mean you know we had some ninety but you know remember how there was a couple you know a lot of hundred degree days last year 

449.40 450.43 B: mhm 

453.94 455.93 B: right right 

455.15 466.25 A: it takes a lot for the water to get warm but once y- once the atlantic water's warm it it gets like you know it almost gets like bath water whereas with the pacific especially like other than malibu 

457.27 458.49 B: yeah 

466.34 478.91 A: it's kind of in august the middle of august even with the temperature being you know the climate that it is you still ha- you still were like shivering in the water cause water yeah the atlantic water's at least ten degrees warmer in the summer 

466.38 467.52 B: yeah 

472.03 473.47 B: right 

474.35 475.74 B: really 

478.35 479.19 B: huh 

479.48 480.35 B: wow 

479.66 490.91 A: yeah any- anybody'll uh anybody that's lived there'll tell you that it's it's really weird because you know it's like ninety five degrees out you're like oh i don't wanna go in the ocean you get in there you're like oh [laughter] yeah [laughter] it's it's pr- 

487.54 489.03 B: yeah [laughter] 

489.78 497.84 B: well also i mean i guess they had all the red flags that were put up because the the tide was so high um the waves were incredible just this like two weeks ago 

497.69 509.04 A: right right well yeah also with hurricane season and everything since it the gulf and the atlantic it that that's gonna you know that that transmits up here even in the water and it just takes a week or two for it to move 

498.11 498.84 B: (( um )) 

500.47 502.17 B: right 

505.76 507.71 B: mhm 

508.80 511.24 B: right 

510.64 511.40 A: (( so )) 

511.62 519.40 A: yeah but pacific's definitely cold that's why even in the summer you'll see people with like uh rash guards or like wet suits you know like real you know like short sleeve ones 

519.23 520.13 B: wow 

520.50 524.52 A: it's i mean you know it looks pretty but it's [laughter] it's a little cold 

520.77 521.50 B: (( hm )) 

523.90 530.37 B: yeah for me w- i mean i i was at just probably after my you know fives or so and that was about as far as i was gonna go [laughter] 

530.43 531.88 B: it was pretty pretty freaky 

530.50 537.26 A: yeah yeah i mean but like this month and and august you'll notice it like if you go back there you'll notice a big change 

535.43 537.00 B: yeah 

537.68 539.39 B: yeah hope so [laughter] 

539.11 540.23 A: [laughter] 

540.42 542.36 A: yeah definitely that's true [laughter] 

540.58 544.06 B: but it w- it was still it was still beautiful out there though it was nice 

544.28 550.66 A: yeah that's what i hear as i said i haven't got you know a chance to check it out but [lipsmack] i'm sure i will before the season's over 

550.71 553.44 B: and my cousin has this lit- because i guess um 

553.27 567.05 B: out there at fire island it's an official national park parkland or whatever so my my my cousin has this book where he has to get a stamp at every national park or whatever so it's like we have to go to wherever the visitors center is so he can get his silly stamp and [laughter] 

564.41 565.27 A: (( [laughter] )) 

567.03 569.02 A: r- everybody's got this thing man
