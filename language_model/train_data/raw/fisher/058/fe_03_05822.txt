80.89 88.00 A: my industry really was starting to be affected before all these corporate scandals came out the actual editing side of it 

88.16 90.11 A: um so 

90.37 105.09 A: what's happened i believe is that all the scandals has made um american investors really really leery about putting their money in the stock market because they feel that everybody's crooked at the top which i quite honestly believe because i worked around these people for like ten years 

104.68 105.84 B: mhm 

105.25 109.95 A: so there's just um there's just a lot of um [lipsmack] [mn] 

110.43 118.84 A: skepticism about people investing in the stock market not only in the united states but actually a lot of europeans as well because 

118.85 126.37 A: people just don't feel everything is just above board they feel there's a lot of kind of you know duplicitous behavior and intrigue and 

126.52 129.89 A: just tremendous um unabashed greed [laughter]

165.60 174.82 B: oh okay well i don't even know what corporate scandals they're talking about because the news just is nothing to me i think the government is the ultimate corporate scandal 

174.11 176.24 A: well of course of course of course 

174.97 177.75 B: and i- i- it's a total sham and 

176.90 180.94 A: well usually with the corporation and governments it's the they're the that's the same people so there's no difference 

179.94 186.74 B: exactly the same thing so like i don't even they're saying what do you think the government can do to curb this and i think government 

185.67 187.55 A: the government can't do anything

333.74 345.67 A: unbelievable and you can own stock and work at these companies you can own it all you have to do is put it in a different family member's name or you can form your own corporation and [laughter] still buy stock for c- for company for 

345.58 360.29 A: yo- yo- you can buy stock in a company that if you're a financial analyst that you're doing analyses on all you have to do is form another company ah form a company under a different name and buy the stock although you're the one do- doing all the an- analyses on the stock 

360.59 361.84 B: oh my god 

361.43 365.45 A: [mn] yeah of course you can do it but see so many years ago you couldn't do that 

364.44 365.77 B: right 

365.46 369.94 A: this is how they've changed it this is how the government and 

368.35 373.63 B: oh man it's all totally totally corrupt everything about it [laughter] 

371.09 372.78 A: it's totally 

372.78 377.58 A: so the only that's gonna change is what ariana helfigson said when i saw her 

377.38 390.58 A: at this great lecture at the ninety second street y. three months ago we've got to have a revolution i'm sorry that's it you can't fix it no not party's gonna be able to fix this i'm sure ah the cops will come and pick me up after i say this but [cough] you

388.81 393.54 B: or i gotta yeah right [laughter] yeah 

390.89 393.88 A: gotta be careful what you say but because 

394.34 405.54 A: everything is so corrupt the democrats the republicans all of it nobody that you put in office is going to be able to change anything now it's too much money it's too much pe- people are getting paid too much money to be corrupt 

404.80 406.05 B: yeah 

405.41 410.52 A: so it's gotta be a whole new way of having a government that's the only way it's gonna change 

409.94 415.74 B: right how do you what do you suppose could bring that about 'cause i've been wracking my brain about this too but yeah but 

414.49 419.93 A: [mn] no the ah the people the people are the only ones how the people can do it [mn] 

417.58 419.45 B: what can the people do 

419.89 421.54 B: what do you think the people could do 

421.02 422.67 A: i'm not quite sure 

422.40 434.47 B: like there g- there are all these protests and the cops beat everyone up and then they protest at the cops' violence you know that last saturday there was a protest against that and like still nothing like i i it looks like

438.65 439.86 B: right right 

440.36 441.70 B: i agree with that 

441.04 443.79 A: but um [mn] 

445.06 450.79 A: well i think one thing that could change a whole lot is if people would stop consuming 

450.58 462.44 A: now of course the economy would really go down the tubes if that happened but if people stopped buying this shit that they sell and say we're not gonna buy your shit unless you change some laws 

452.63 455.97 B: (( i agree completely because yeah [laughter] )) 

456.74 459.45 B: [laughter] oh 

461.59 463.45 B: y- yeah 

462.26 475.58 A: we're gonna sit at home we're gonna plant the potatoes in the backyard and eat it before we buy this shit from you because let me tell you during the civil rights movement that's what people did and it did change things to a degree [mn] 

467.33 468.37 B: wow

481.65 483.84 B: this is exactly how i feel though 

483.00 495.46 A: i've worked in this industry for years believe me people taking their dollars and saying we're not gonna do it we're not gonna buy your shit anymore believe me it can change peacefully 

485.22 486.21 B: uh-huh 

495.45 499.92 A: it can change 'cause i don't believe violence vio- violence changes anything 

498.00 501.64 B: i agree with that too it just scares people and then they'll win 

500.25 509.73 A: it scares people and it kinda gives you this kind of you know thrill yeah we beat their ass yeah yeah yeah you know but in the end ah you know yo- yo- yo- yo- you become just as bad as your oppressors
