0.13 4.38 B: (( hi i'm uh hey matt what's your name )) 

0.15 1.55 A: (( hello uh uh )) 

3.33 4.75 A: hi my name's mark 

4.71 6.58 B: mark hey so what do you think about all this 

7.41 21.28 A: uh i don't like these corporations much i think they are causing a lot of these economic problems certainly um just in terms of being able to predict uh you know for investors what is a good stock they don't really know any more 

21.08 22.84 B: yeah 

21.35 23.83 A: it caused a lot of insecurity 

23.24 28.13 B: so do you think it's surprising that something like enron or these other like gascos happened 

28.12 32.51 A: [noise] uh [sigh] see i i'm not really an expert on that kind of stuff i can't 

31.21 35.53 B: no i mean i know i i i'm not asking for your expert opinion i mean what do you really think 

34.29 42.33 A: yeah uh i don't really think it's that surprising just working in companies myself i see a lot of dishonest stuff going 

39.93 40.75 B: yeah 

42.07 48.76 B: yeah and i think it's kinda the nature of like the situation which we live that it's not that we encourage dishonest but we encourage like 

48.77 57.63 B: um i don't know like monopoly you know right right which at any cost which i think this is like a necessary for obvious throwback that 

55.33 67.62 A: yeah in terms of there being like laws ag- like specifically buying things i don't even think people are mostly aware of like laws when they made these big decisions it seems like it's more of like a secondary concern 

63.07 63.91 B: no 

65.18 66.93 B: yeah 

67.52 74.67 B: and i mean i don't think there's any accountability or there's not mu- there's not many watch dog groups or anything to make sure it doesn't happen right 

74.22 83.56 A: yeah pretty much i mean i don't think i mean the s. a. c. has some kind of power there but uh i don't think that they have any like binding powers just 

83.37 87.70 B: yeah but the s. c. c. is itself a conglomerate right remember there the- 

86.04 88.11 A: i said the uh the s. a. c. 

87.75 96.59 B: yeah there was just recently that law passed by consolidated airpower too which was terrifying right the s. c. c. you know like consolidated all the airwaves and t._v. waves 

92.46 94.74 A: (( oh definitely oh )) 

96.57 98.70 A: that's s. c. c. that's different 

98.34 99.76 B: i'm sorry what did you say then 

99.55 102.63 A: s. a. c. security and exchange commission 

100.52 101.85 B: oh s. e. c. 

102.03 107.95 B: oh that's right no i was wondering how these two tied in i was thinking what are you talking about oh i see yeah yeah 

107.05 110.95 A: but uh i think of that's political too you know in terms of uh 

111.20 116.46 A: these companies seem to have all kinds of connections in the congress and the presidency and uh 

115.10 126.84 B: yeah especially with this current one huh like with the whole enron thing that was really sketchy and even halbert to a y- well even to more of an extent halbert is like a terrifying entity [laughter] in itself i think 

117.31 118.34 A: yeah 

126.87 141.29 A: yeah and i i think the court system isn't helping much either like in the worldcom settlement they were able to settle for less than a billion dollars when they committed eleven billion dollars worth of fraud so it means they they could pretty much eat you know more than ten billion dollars that they got illegally 

136.49 138.97 B: [laughter] right 

139.96 143.64 B: that's a good point i didn't know about those statistics wow 

142.48 144.36 A: yeah it's pretty disturbing 

144.00 148.19 B: so it's just like gambling they can go all right our loss will be one billion but our gain will be ten billion 

148.34 157.85 A: yeah they just basically were able to compromise they go to court and some judge gives them a lenient sentence you know it looks like a lot of money seven hundred and fifty million dollars but 

156.06 161.94 B: right but like considering the big picture of like what worldcom's assets are it's not very significant 

160.92 168.85 A: i heard that they're actually gonna be in a better position than like at&t and some of the and like sprint after this bankruptcy than before 

165.55 167.41 B: [laughter] wow 

167.87 174.85 B: [laughter] wow that's funny that's funny i mean do do you think all this stuff is shaking investor confidence 

169.30 171.15 A: which really disturbed me 

175.33 176.32 A: um 

176.65 181.04 A: see it's hard for me to tell uh i think it sh- probably small investors yes 

178.16 179.06 B: yeah 

180.84 182.59 B: yeah 

181.53 195.62 A: cause uh it seems like the institutional investors have like this edge you know they know what's really going on they can tell what people in these companies are really doing but uh the the smaller guy it's much more difficult for him to have any kind of connections 

191.07 191.84 B: [noise] 

195.47 197.20 B: yeah 

196.51 201.95 A: so yeah i guess it's more difficult in that way and shakes investor confidence so 

200.65 206.45 B: and then and then so it has negative repercussions on you know the economy and stuff oh once it does that right 

205.67 210.97 A: yeah definitely i mean if we're under this supposedly capitalist system and it's best to be 

211.04 220.17 A: you know based on people investing our knowledge and if they don't know what they're investing in and it it makes a lot of problems in the system sure 

217.09 218.95 B: right 

219.16 230.82 B: right and like who know- like yeah if there was something like i would in- i mean i i could invest money in theory but i don't even know whether i could or should support so if there was like a watch dog group or series of groups 

230.69 245.03 B: that could like somehow take care of accountability and make sure that workers are paid fairly and that nothing shady is going on behind the scenes and actually maybe have some companies volunteer to have their books you know like coca cola did this too they were like right after enron they were like okay now all of our books are open 

244.83 252.75 B: so you're like p- cr- no public investors and they can see what we're doing with our money i think more companies should just follow that 

252.18 264.94 A: yeah i i think it's unlikely to happen though it's it's just like the they're all gonna have so much to hide and then so much to benefit by not letting everyone know and i think a lot of the uh people inside a lot of the executives wind up 

254.30 255.56 B: no i know 

257.53 258.54 B: yeah 

264.97 270.61 A: uh making money off of uh selling things at the right time and things l- uh you know insider information 

268.56 271.96 B: yeah really like martha stewart [laughter] yeah 

270.81 272.52 A: like yeah exactly 

272.38 273.42 B: yeah 

272.56 276.17 A: with bush and his pelican shares is not really a good example 

274.71 280.06 B: [noise] yeah that's sketchy to- that's even more sketchy than martha stewart yeah that's r- 

278.95 283.35 A: yeah it's like it what kind of an example is he setting it's like uh 

283.45 292.34 A: i- i- it's he's allowed to you know sell his stocks when he knows that the stock's gonna go down you know you can't really expect this guy to do that much 

289.48 290.64 B: (( right )) 

292.10 294.26 B: [laughter] and so he didn't neither did he 

294.42 306.75 A: well he got these memos and he wound up and he just said that he didn't read them you know i mean if every corporate executive was like well i didn't bother to read all these memos and legalistic stuff you know then then everyone can just plead ignorance i- 

294.59 295.25 B: (( so )) 

298.86 299.78 B: right 

302.14 302.95 B: yeah 

305.76 314.73 B: [laughter] but then again i as far as george bush goes i wouldn't be surprised if he you know didn't or couldn't read them in the first place so [laughter] i give him that much but what 

312.06 313.13 A: if what 

314.41 317.51 A: if he what if he didn't read them in the first 

315.39 320.34 B: (( yeah if he couldn't read them or if he didn't read them cause he doesn't seem like the most literate like knowledgeable person but )) 

320.67 323.80 B: yes so it's no excuse there's no doubt 

322.72 327.36 A: yeah i don't know i think he uh he's smarter than people give him credit for 

324.95 325.86 B: (( no u- )) 

326.69 328.40 B: yeah you think so you think it's an act 

328.39 335.26 A: yeah i think most of it's an act like really just playing j- you know he turns into a character and it's a big theatre 

329.07 331.25 B: or to an extent yeah cause h- 

335.33 346.08 A: but uh i i think he's he's not as dumb as as he sounds i mean probably um like some intellectual issues but like on in terms of like world like politics he knows what he's doing 

336.54 338.23 B: yeah 

339.01 340.53 B: no i mean 

343.97 344.67 B: (( is it )) 

344.93 349.70 B: yeah and as a businessman like he knows his shit too that's essentially what he is 

347.23 355.47 A: yeah he has no problems like firing people hiring people you know knowing what he has to do to get ahead 

354.88 359.05 B: yeah no it doesn't seem like he has that problem yeah 

357.68 361.51 A: i have to ask can you remember any of these other questions i can't [noise] 

360.40 368.51 B: w- i'm not really clear i mean i remember how yeah i'm not sure i mean i think the other one was how how would it affect the economy as a whole right 

367.84 372.14 A: yeah so i guess uh hm i don't know what do you think on that one 

372.13 373.50 B: [laughter] i mean i 

372.38 375.23 A: what do you think the long term and short term prospects are 

375.01 382.72 B: i i think they're bleak a- and you know here in new york our as of today our our unemployment's lower than national unemployment level 

382.68 383.89 A: really 

383.26 391.54 B: which is like a first time since some said the depression or something yeah it's reached it's like six point three or something and the national level's six point two or six point one 

391.65 394.96 A: officially probably people just off unemployment 

391.71 393.70 B: so like we're yeah 

394.88 403.82 B: right and never mind people who are like working part time jobs and like just bar- not even really making money they're just employed by like mcdonald's or something so like 

401.57 408.33 A: yeah oh cause i heard in chinatown they had a fif- like a not fifty percent but i think it was like tw- around twenty five percent unemployment 

407.92 416.41 B: wow wow i'm not surprised i mean i think that part of that is it in fact the a symptom of the lack of investor confidence and 

409.31 410.07 A: no 

416.32 423.78 B: trusting giving money to the corporations and people are investing less money in terms of result there's less money and it's just a down running spiral 

423.06 432.60 A: yeah i think any any impact its had on like making the recession worse is just like an im- take more time for any investors to have any confidence in this 

432.62 436.51 A: you know it's a it doesn't have to be that um 

437.12 451.51 A: it you know one individual investor you know does enough confidence but it it it pulls together all these people and it creates like a net effect and you know so these a lot of people may be saying oh yeah it's fine to invest now but uh 

445.24 447.02 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

451.71 460.96 A: i think in the long term they have a yeah they need to create some kind of commission or some kind of god like something that's simple but you know is gonna get done 

456.30 458.08 B: yeah 

460.72 467.90 B: i mean with i think i wo- would it would it be simple enough just to be like all right here's like a a voluntary thing that the company is gonna do 

467.85 480.19 B: and if they do it then like potential investors'll be like oh this company is legitimate they have their books on you know on record and they have like public accountants checking things over they're obviously going to do better they're not gonna be there's no fraud going on there's no insider trading 

480.17 486.97 B: so maybe that would encourage investors to invest in companies and that would encourage the companies to become to have their records public no 

486.01 493.64 A: i like what they did with the uh getting the c._f._o.s and c._e._o.s to like sign some statement but i haven't heard much on that lately 

493.04 501.48 B: but do you think it did anything i remember i remember that being signed but i heard it was just a lot of like hubbub it has not real i'm not sure though i mean i i who knows what i've actually understood 

497.57 499.01 A: oh really 

500.96 504.88 A: yeah people could just say oh i just signed that but didn't really look over the books 

503.23 507.96 B: yeah yeah i mean it was a huge document that they signed right it 

508.11 509.85 B: (( was like a [noise] )) 

508.24 511.99 A: uh i think it was just supposed to be just like a one page kinda deal 

511.31 512.24 B: oh really 

512.01 513.33 A: yeah 

512.39 513.23 B: (( huh it )) 

513.70 514.79 A: but uh 

513.73 518.73 B: was a good step but i mean i think it's just a cred- a a kind of ostentatious right it's just showy 

518.91 522.63 B: nothing really who knows what could really come of it i wanna see the results you know 

522.38 529.57 A: exactly yeah i i just don't know how to measure them just cause i'm so distant from these financial community 

529.05 535.28 B: yes similar to i mean i know i really realistically wouldn't indulge in that i mean money i can't even see that money maybe the future i will 

534.50 535.31 A: [laughter] 

535.16 536.15 B: (( [laughter] )) 

535.92 550.29 B: yeah i never meant working for a corporation or anything like that i can't i've never even been in a similar situation it's just hard for me to relate to it i just know what's go- i know what's going on is wrong and that like upsets me cause i know people can stop it they don't cause they're being either they're getting kickbacks or they're getting some kind of 

541.79 542.82 A: [noise] i hear you 

549.48 553.49 A: and i think i think one of the the big problems with all this is that uh 

553.42 566.20 A: the longer the real another effect that this could have is like one company is like putting up false profits this makes them seem like more profitable like the better company and then this other company might have to like lay people off 

565.98 567.79 B: yeah 

566.11 569.11 A: all kinds of like negative repercussions in that vein 

569.18 570.46 B: yeah that's true 

571.52 581.67 B: i mean i i think furthermore another problem is that both republicans and democrats are getting kickbacks from companies that they probably know are doing illegal activities or they you know that they don't look or they assume the blind eye towards 

581.35 589.60 A: it may be uh some kind of actual campaign finance reform would be uh a major boost to the markets when there's 

588.34 594.16 B: and that's a good point yeah i mean i there doesn't seem like related like a related point but i think actually it you just bind them together 

594.40 597.36 B: yeah and that that would increase investor confidence too i think 

597.73 599.89 A: yeah i guess uh it'll never happen but
