60.00 69.48 A: well the code of conduct i- i believe is that uh you know uh i think the government need to do something but then again i'm not sure how uh 

69.70 78.40 A: how well the government can do it considering they're all gonna be considering a lot of people are just gonna be political about it they're gonna be in it for their own investments as well 

78.45 79.66 A: uh 

79.76 89.28 A: and so i i think that uh there needs to be a sort of checks and balance system as well in regards i suppose to one by the government type of thing 

89.44 102.34 B: yeah same here actually um i think they should start putting more take care of more tax and more securities because like people still try to get away by fooling some for somewhere 

102.50 108.83 B: like they do some kind of wrong things and yeah they escape through these 

108.91 113.76 B: normal rules and regulations because they are they're finding some loopholes everywhere
