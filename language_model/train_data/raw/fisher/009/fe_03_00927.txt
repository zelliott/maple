0.15 2.36 B: hi my name is beth 

1.96 4.87 A: hello beth my name is wendell how are you today 

4.26 6.75 B: i'm doing good wendell how about you 

6.32 8.16 A: i'm doing terrific 

7.79 11.43 B: good i'm gonna let you open up on this 

11.42 15.78 A: oh my goodness well they er certainly picked a good topic today didn't they 

12.32 14.03 B: [laughter] 

15.75 17.16 B: oh yes 

15.81 19.76 A: what what what should the united states do well 

19.78 26.65 A: my thought is that we have a very evil person running iraq 

26.64 39.17 A: [mn] and he pretty clearly has either developed or is about to develop some very bad weapons that would have awful consequences for the world if they were used [mn] 

39.25 44.43 A: and i'm of the opinion that he needs to be removed 

44.44 53.87 A: and that if ah france and germany aren't gonna join with the united states the united states probably needs to go in and do it ourselves 

45.40 46.30 B: [noise] 

54.25 57.59 A: [lipsmack] how does that compare with your thoughts on the matter 

55.95 57.41 B: (( [noise] [mn] [sigh] )) 

58.36 67.63 B: what is so confusing for me is i mean they've known this for the last ten years since the gulf war why now 

68.43 77.29 B: [noise] that that's where my confusion comes from [lipsmack] is why do they want to go to war now what has happened in you know 

77.32 86.14 B: in a relatively short period of time like like say the last year to cause them to want to do this y- do you understand what i'm saying 

84.96 87.72 A: uh-huh yes i do well 

86.53 92.40 B: because this has been going on for a long time and i really think it has to do with the oil 

89.65 91.37 A: yes yes it has [lipsmack] 

93.36 98.13 A: well one thing of course that's happened was nine eleven [mn] 

93.82 94.82 B: [noise] 

98.04 111.70 A: and the recognition that there's a growing number of people who not only hate the united states but are now very actively acting upon those feelings [lipsmack] 

111.87 119.93 A: and i think perhaps more of us recognize that the threat is perhaps greater than we had perceived it to be 

120.50 123.16 A: a- among some of these people 

122.57 129.82 B: yeah i think you're right i think that brought it to awareness because you know america just always thought it was so superior 

130.17 133.94 B: um and untouchable maybe that's the word i need 

130.87 131.94 A: well we 

133.33 136.36 A: w- we had never really had ah 

136.72 146.79 A: we had never been attacked ah in the continental united states pearl harbor had been attacked and that was the only time that happened since when the war of eighteen twelve i guess when the british ah 

140.71 143.11 B: [noise] exactly 

146.94 153.58 A: burned washington so um [lipsmack] for many many years it wasn't really even thought of that 

153.67 157.39 A: others could hurt us [lipsmack] and now it's pretty clear that they can 

158.43 166.26 B: i mean i i understand what you're saying i i just don't agree that war is the answer because there is the c._i._a. 

165.32 165.88 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

166.95 176.05 B: and they've always had covert operations and you know they've tried to take out you know all these bad people here and there or people that they just didn't or 

167.40 168.27 A: right 

176.05 185.76 B: for whatever reason and i don't understand why so many people have to be hurt to do that when there is a more efficient way of doing it 

182.26 182.97 A: (( no )) 

185.31 189.30 A: uh-huh well how how would you ah how do you think it should be handled 

189.32 190.11 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

190.27 196.61 A: like y- y- y- you say y- you're suggesting that the c._i._a. go in and and what assassinate saddam hussein or 

196.38 199.42 B: well i mean it would be one way to get rid of him [noise] 

196.77 198.43 A: destabilize the 

199.14 206.16 A: [mn] i i believe the plan is that the c._i._a. is expected to play a part in the war in any event 

206.45 209.11 A: that that's part of the strategy but 

209.46 210.81 A: um 

211.59 219.99 A: th- th- the people in the defense department apparently don't believe that's enough to get the job done alone without conventional forces 

219.87 220.65 B: mm 

221.26 225.36 B: that may be true but i'd like to see it done that way [laughter] 

221.28 222.59 A: and it put [laughter] 

225.94 232.43 A: well of course nobody wants bloodshed and loss of american particularly american lives or any lives 

231.20 234.84 B: well a lot of people are going to get hurt no matter what 

234.21 236.08 A: well that's that's right 

235.33 242.17 B: i mean you know there are going to be civilians in iraq that are going to be hurt and again in neighboring countries [noise] [noise] 

242.73 245.29 A: that's right and if we don't go to war 

246.50 253.65 B: i mean saddam hussein is still going to do horrible things to people because we know he's done it in the past 

246.51 247.93 A: (( [lipsmack] then )) 

252.93 258.05 A: well then so a number of people would get hurt in that event as well 

257.04 260.09 B: [noise] true but i think it would be a whole lot 

260.52 266.40 B: it would be more cost efficient to take him out discreetly as opposed to 

266.52 269.28 B: mounting a whole all out war 

268.81 274.56 A: well that that'd be a great way to go if it's possible they say he has body doubles and [sigh] 

275.46 278.81 A: all kinds of security around him and [sigh] 

279.33 280.26 A: (( ah )) 

279.50 282.24 B: [mn] that's true and you can be very careful but it 

282.39 284.62 B: i don't think anything is perfect 

284.51 290.37 A: well that's true after all ah several american presidents have been assassinated haven't they so 

291.08 301.45 A: and ah we always think we have pretty good security of course we've got an open society here and the president goes around and makes speeches in various places and um 

300.48 303.38 B: [noise] [lipsmack] that's true [noise] 

301.70 304.67 A: it- it's a little different over there 

304.92 317.18 B: but also when the president travels it's like they close down roads you know they inspect everybody that's coming into whatever crowd they're hand selected so it's not like you know he just goes in among the people 

316.93 319.86 A: well that's right and and they still get killed 

318.84 321.71 B: [noise] yes so i [noise] 

320.42 323.55 A: or or or wounded reagan got shot and ah 

323.78 325.61 A: fortunately survived 

325.66 327.49 A: ah but there's ah 

327.85 333.18 A: so you're right that ah security can't be perfect 

333.76 335.43 B: [mn] that's true 

334.32 340.18 A: so that that might be worth trying and i i share your concern about the ah 

340.46 347.39 A: the bloodshed that's gonna happen if we go to war it looks like we're going to ah barring a barring a last minute miracle 

344.82 345.83 B: i know 

347.14 350.12 B: [noise] i know the president's supposed to go on t._v. tonight 

351.34 352.75 A: well 

355.78 356.85 A: (( [lipsmack] so )) 

357.70 361.72 B: but it's it's just a [noise] very frightening thing all the way around 

361.76 364.54 A: it's one of these situations where 

365.33 371.23 A: there's no ideal solution it seems that whatever whether we do or don't go in 

371.91 375.39 A: [lipsmack] um some bad things are gonna happen 

374.36 376.18 B: [noise] [mn] well yeah i mean 

376.51 386.22 B: hindsight will always be twenty twenty and you know once this is all over or years after this is all [noise] over everybody will say well this should have been done or that should have been done 

386.63 391.05 A: well and i i think it'll be known pretty quickly ah w- 

391.28 402.27 A: if and when we go in we're we're either gonna find some of these weapons that they've been hiding or we're not [mn] and once once we take over the country it won't be too long before that's discovered 

402.83 416.81 A: ah as it is now the inspectors go around trying to find these things and ah apparently there're still a lot of them that haven't been accounted for that it's known that they had and i don't believe they they just vanished into thin air they're they're 

410.36 412.25 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

416.73 418.34 A: being hidden somewhere 

417.54 419.45 B: [noise] oh definitely 

420.15 424.33 B: definitely and i do [noise] not want to see that used 

425.52 430.47 B: but who knows what war or bombing could do to those things 

431.26 432.95 A: (( well it's ah )) 

431.92 443.55 B: 'cause i mean if they're hidden and you know they get hit with a bomb you know whatever it is whatev- whether it's a biological agent or chemical will get loosened into the atmosphere 

443.80 447.09 A: mhm and that would not be a good thing 

446.14 448.12 B: no so i mean there's a lot 

448.47 451.64 B: (( [noise] there's a lot to look at from all ends i guess )) 

453.00 454.74 A: well you're right ah mm [mn] 

455.20 459.56 B: and it's well of course like anything else it's something that you just can't 

460.05 463.54 B: you know go into without giving it any thought 

463.93 466.36 B: and there is no right or wrong in this one 

467.53 470.35 A: world war two was pretty clear [lipsmack] ah 

469.59 470.89 B: oh yes 

470.99 476.10 A: and ah times are a bit more complex nowadays al- although 

474.49 479.29 B: true but then again the united states did not get involved until pearl harbor 

479.26 481.38 A: that's right and 

480.83 483.37 B: not until we were directly attacked 

482.47 486.05 A: that's kinda what's happening again isn't it ah they ah 

486.08 490.28 A: [lipsmack] attacked new york and and washington and now suddenly we're 

489.57 490.52 B: yeah 

490.60 493.74 A: more interested in these things 

490.74 491.96 B: (( but )) 

493.28 498.55 B: but it's kinda hard to say like how much saddam hussein had to do with that 

500.32 502.43 A: [mn] ah you're right [mn] 

502.27 508.68 B: you know it's like he just became the evil person or the target because we can't find bin laden 

510.37 511.24 A: well 

512.70 517.29 A: [mn] you could say that or another way to look at it is that there's more than one threat [lipsmack] 

517.37 519.94 B: y- exactly [laughter] 

517.65 521.75 A: that ah al al qaeda are not the only people who are 

521.87 527.41 A: who are dangerous to the world that ah iraq is as well and ah 

523.77 525.21 B: exactly 

528.04 531.17 A: and then we have ah north korea causing trouble [lipsmack] 

531.27 532.22 A: (( ah )) 

532.55 533.67 B: that's true 

532.59 539.37 A: the latest i heard yesterday i- is that we're sending some bombers over there to ah make a point that 

539.68 541.23 A: they shouldn't be ah 

542.27 545.33 A: doing ah getting into mischief ah while we're 

545.37 547.89 A: while our attention is diverted [mn] 

547.67 560.83 B: wow i mean that's something that's very important because [noise] [noise] you know with a distraction going on with a war they could come into power very quickly or could sneak in under you know our radar so to speak 

550.93 551.86 A: and there's 

560.82 566.06 A: well and we lost a lot of american lives in the korean war last time 

566.38 578.71 A: [lipsmack] and that's um i- iraq is one thing you've got saddam hussein and ah there's no question if we go in we're gonna win but north korea now you're talking well is there 

566.62 567.66 B: that's true 

578.82 592.19 A: china behind them or russia now you're talking about some very big powers and the potential to to really ah ah get ugly [lipsmack] if some of these countries wind up ah fighting 

588.06 589.89 B: yeah that's very [noise] true 

592.43 596.69 A: [lipsmack] so that's possibly even a greater danger 

598.73 599.95 B: i think you're r
