61.97 62.53 A: uh-huh 

62.68 63.59 B: and uh

75.69 77.80 B: you know i think they're so popular 

78.14 78.98 B: uh 

80.62 82.96 A: because if you are look at a people who are suffering 

83.12 84.07 B: well 

83.40 86.34 A: and i believe their their true personalities show up 

86.98 92.40 A: and to tell you the truth i'm not even sure if they're really true or if they're just trying to show off or if they're just pretending 

92.50 93.31 B: right 

93.11 95.17 A: i d- i d- you know i don't get them 

95.60 97.07 A: i seriously don't get them

128.52 134.41 B: actually th- one of the women one of the finalists or whatever was from boulder so she was kind of popular and that's 

134.54 136.62 B: very near by where i live

142.53 145.48 B: uh love for hire or 

146.46 149.86 A: but just the idea of who wants to get to marry a millionaire i mean 

149.42 150.33 B: right 

150.02 155.33 A: right i- it it is great if you really love that person but to show up on how many 

155.43 156.85 A: five or six shows 

157.25 157.68 B: right 

157.28 160.63 A: to be chosen by somebody and then to marry him 

158.94 159.64 B: yes 

160.68 161.26 B: uh 

160.75 162.75 A: or her it's ridiculous

179.92 180.71 B: yeah 

181.47 182.84 B: not bad 

181.91 184.27 A: but obviously with no school and no money

187.25 188.39 A: oh uh really 

188.40 190.90 B: no to carry it off no 

190.63 191.83 A: oh okay

196.62 197.53 A: (( america )) 

197.73 198.72 B: yeah and 

198.24 199.38 A: that's just sad 

199.61 200.60 B: it's very sad 

200.76 202.22 B: i don't know it's kind of a 

202.40 204.25 B: picture of society 

204.71 207.22 A: the the- well this is this is something interesting 

207.36 212.45 A: and i just i watched it the other night this was with practice i believe they they their 

212.89 219.88 A: shoot their uh uh you know (( friend )) time was sc- uh switched from sunday to monday 

219.98 220.45 B: uh-huh 

220.38 221.97 A: because a reality show 

222.70 224.87 A: is the one that is taking place 

225.04 229.22 A: uh that is being um i'm looking for a word now 

229.50 229.99 B: it's more 

229.52 232.44 A: it is being show instead of their i- i- in their time frame 

232.54 233.23 B: oh 

232.71 238.47 A: so they had to be pushed from sunday to monday and everybody was just you know uh extremely upset 

238.90 239.63 A: and uh 

239.86 247.98 A: and complaining on t._v. i mean some of the i- it seems that all the script movies and all the script series are being pushed aside by these reality shows 

249.07 254.44 A: i would really like to see somebody who likes (( it you know )) just to see what is so interesting about them 

258.85 262.79 B: perhaps um you know sailing across the ocean you know real adventure 

262.28 269.25 A: like documentaries or something but without any you know cu- cutting the scenes out just showing everyday i i think that's what we need 

263.31 264.46 B: yes 

268.14 268.57 B: or 

268.96 279.03 B: or without pitting other humans against one another i i don't like the competition you know that it's so mean and they have to vote people out i think that's horrible 

272.12 273.15 A: oh 

278.35 281.76 A: i agree with you i couldn't agree more 

279.31 282.76 B: i i wouldn't be able to d- do it i wouldn't be able to do it 

283.53 284.92 A: no neither could i 

283.68 285.40 B: you know vote somebody out 

286.11 288.82 B: so i i guess i'm too nice to be on survivor 

289.06 293.99 A: i agree and i don't think t- to tell you the truth i don't think i'm i'm t- tough enough to be on a survivor 

294.52 298.62 A: it's like i you know what i don't care i just want to go back home this is not worth it 

298.83 301.22 B: well some of the things i have watched the osbournes 

301.52 302.01 A: uh-huh 

301.80 308.43 B: and that- that's kind of a reality show i mean it shows a day in the life of the osbourne family and that's kind of funny 

309.14 315.38 A: i haven't watched that one but t- tell me tell me more about it they started from th- from the very beginning from the very beginning of the day 

311.93 312.68 B: it's uh 

315.45 320.20 B: it's ozzy osbourne uh you know an old like heavy metal rock star 

320.02 320.42 A: mhm

325.99 328.50 A: i've seen them on t._v. they're extremely ugly 

328.54 334.10 B: they're very strange and ugly and he wanders around sort of in a daze and uh the family 

334.78 338.12 B: interaction is is just kind of funny to watch i think that's 

338.72 342.28 B: that's kind of funny because they're not trying to you know hurt anybody or 

342.47 342.98 A: uh-huh 

343.03 344.68 B: you know it's a day in the life 

343.48 346.05 A: you just see how their how their (( though )) they go 

346.22 346.83 B: yeah 

346.36 350.40 A: i'm just curious if it's a reality show how real it really is 

350.50 351.08 B: right 

351.31 354.43 A: you know they know they're being uh you know 

355.36 355.91 A: filmed 

356.33 356.82 B: right 

356.60 366.30 A: is this really what their life is about or do they just try to bicker and try to be mean to one another just because they're on a reality show and they know some other people 

358.95 359.49 B: right 

366.42 367.50 A: will be watching

371.82 373.70 A: (( you know )) 

372.10 380.01 B: they don't feed -em they don't feed them well and i thought you know if i was starving and there was a camera person right there and i knew they were eating dinner 

380.13 383.07 B: i i d- you know i don't think i could do that 

384.26 393.61 A: oh i that's this is good that was really good w- well tell me what happened with the other what was the preface of that show just to show those people live or 

393.74 394.72 B: the osbournes 

394.52 395.01 A: uh-huh 

395.19 395.61 B: yes 

395.77 399.29 B: and there's also another show that's similar to that with uh 

399.91 401.54 B: oh what is it that blonde 

401.90 402.94 B: bomb shell 

403.12 405.08 B: woman that i can't remember her name 

405.24 408.61 B: right this moment but it's another day in the life of her 

408.50 409.52 A: is it pamela anderson 

408.76 409.03 B: and 

409.96 410.23 A: no 

410.03 416.13 B: no no close very close but this and i can't remember her name but it you know it's 

413.02 414.17 A: no i can't no 

416.64 420.70 B: i don't know maybe everyone's life is just so boring and they have to 

420.94 429.35 A: see how other people are living i know they're very th- that's what they were talking about on on the other show that they're very easy and very cheap to produce 

429.52 429.98 B: right 

430.06 432.31 A: and if they have such a good uh 

432.40 438.09 A: public and a- audience you know it's worth it for them to shoot cheap shows if they're going to be watched 

438.19 438.91 B: right 

438.94 439.74 A: so 

440.15 445.56 A: but i don't know what is so interesting about them except that the other people as we said bicker and 

440.26 440.63 B: (( also )) 

445.76 448.67 B: i guess or unless it's sort of v- voyeur 

446.11 446.52 A: and 

447.54 448.72 A: appreciate your life more 

448.88 452.38 B: you know voyeuristic where you're watching someone else's life but 

453.17 455.35 B: but it's not like you're really spying on them 

454.14 457.94 A: that is scary and freaky and twisted 

456.16 457.61 B: it is a little scary 

458.54 459.07 B: yes 

459.33 460.33 A: oh no 

459.46 462.58 B: well i mean of course they know that they're being watched so 

462.96 464.06 B: you know they must act 

464.17 464.80 B: differently 

465.65 468.30 B: you know i i know there was a re- reality show 

466.81 467.22 A: uh-huh 

468.42 469.83 B: back when um 

470.54 472.01 B: couples living together 

472.04 472.55 A: mhm 

472.75 477.82 B: and you know how they bicker and how you know they fight and you know how they 

477.98 479.52 B: try to get along and 

480.33 484.59 B: but uh yeah maybe it's kind of a voyeuristic thing where you know 

485.03 486.66 B: people can watch and 

487.30 487.99 B: i don't know 

487.52 492.22 A: and they're allowed to do that they're don't think it's it's bad what they're doing and it's not acceptable 

488.70 489.70 B: and they're allowed to 

492.19 495.33 B: it's socially acceptable on t._v. mhm 

493.85 494.25 A: right 

495.89 496.42 A: wow 

496.40 496.95 B: huh 

497.26 502.94 A: well i never thought i would be thinking about reality shows as much as i just did 

499.68 501.29 B: me neither 

504.25 510.58 B: me neither i probably won't watch -em after this anymore than i did before 

511.44 517.50 A: survivor's commercials are amazing for in- for misused indefinite pronouns i love that 

516.96 521.04 B: that's great what what what grade do you teach 

518.35 520.91 A: so oh goodness 

521.08 527.26 A: i i'm i work with international students if you haven't noticed i have a- an accent so 

525.99 526.67 B: yes you do 

527.69 531.77 A: i work with international students and i also teach beginners writing to americans 

532.00 532.83 B: wonderful 

532.25 535.05 A: so both of those classes and i t- i teach writing 

535.33 539.20 A: so it really works well just to show that as an examp- as an example 

539.94 543.15 B: uh t._v. and newspapers get away with it all the time 

542.80 543.75 A: oh th- i know 

544.00 544.58 A: i know 

544.73 552.58 A: and it's interesting every it's interesting too i sometimes would mention survivor and all of those reality shows they're ashamed to say they're watching them 

552.79 553.36 B: ah ha 

553.61 554.91 B: ashamed 

573.47 574.74 B: ah ha 

574.42 576.25 A: so i don't know
