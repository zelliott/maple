11.82 14.32 A: sounds like we are going to talk about bio terrorism 

14.67 16.59 B: bio terrorism 

17.03 18.44 B: one of my favorites 

18.80 19.38 A: yes 

19.65 20.39 B: yes 

20.94 22.26 A: well what are your thoughts 

22.30 23.38 B: my thoughts 

24.01 28.73 B: gee whiz we we developed and we sold it to them and now we are going to get it back 

29.57 31.62 A: i think that's a very good observation 

32.27 32.80 A: i think that 

32.32 34.74 B: i think it's a very reasonable observation 

34.53 37.64 A: i think it is as well um i guess the next 

37.79 43.16 A: w- thing would be what what do you think about how we would prevent it though i mean uh do you there's a way to 

43.30 47.70 B: uh i i don't believe there is any way to prevent bio terrorism period 

47.00 47.84 A: i agree with you 

48.08 49.52 A: i agree with you i think it's tough 

48.47 49.42 B: uh uh i i 

49.85 51.95 B: i i think that the actual 

52.18 52.67 B: ah 

53.36 56.87 B: threat about terrorism is is vastly overrated 

57.28 57.66 A: do you 

57.98 59.36 B: yes i do i i 

58.92 59.38 A: by 

59.90 64.75 A: by thinking that it's not realistic to happen or that that if it did happen it wouldn't be as devastating 

64.77 68.11 B: i i don't think that it would be as devastating as as 

68.71 71.50 B: most people think i mean think about the anthrax 

71.52 71.90 A: mhm 

72.02 73.92 B: scare tha- that occurred what 

73.64 74.02 A: mhm 

74.12 75.31 B: uh year and a half ago 

75.24 75.65 A: right 

76.22 78.05 B: the uh anthrax 

78.80 82.28 B: was handled by a lot of different people a lot of people were exposed to it 

82.65 84.58 B: and how many actual cases were there 

85.06 85.53 A: right 

85.82 86.07 B: uh 

87.35 90.72 B: i read a report recently that that indicated 

91.21 93.66 B: that most of the stuff that's out there 

93.85 96.57 B: your your normal immune system would take care of 

96.58 97.10 A: really 

96.77 98.51 B: u- unless you got a direct 

99.36 102.21 B: you know inhalation just just a huge 

102.58 103.71 B: huge gulp of it 

103.98 108.53 A: so you think um like bio terrorism would be like them gassing us 

108.70 112.13 A: to some extent or do you think it would be more of a form 

112.73 117.41 A: like anthrax was like through a different avenue through or mail or through 

118.45 121.05 A: i mean (( how )) what would you think the most logical form of 

120.49 120.75 B: uh 

121.19 124.69 B: i'll i'll think that it it would probably be done with water supply 

124.93 125.38 A: really 

125.60 128.79 B: yeah i i think that would be the easiest and most effective manner 

128.99 129.47 A: mhm 

129.89 130.57 B: but uh 

131.08 135.45 B: i i don't think that really they could deliver it to a large enough population 

135.93 139.86 B: e- even in a a large population center like new york or los angeles 

140.47 142.42 A: before it was stopped or before it was caught 

142.59 145.43 B: before it was caught and and stopped and i mean 

143.72 144.11 A: mhm 

145.08 145.94 A: treated or whatever 

146.07 149.63 B: is is just going to be carried by prevailing winds in the one area 

149.88 150.38 A: mhm 

150.24 154.11 B: and that's not what they are looking to do they are looking to get masses of people 

154.26 154.74 A: right 

155.40 157.36 B: so so i i don't feel like 

157.50 160.64 B: i feel like water supply is would be the easiest way for them to do it 

161.19 165.56 A: i think it would be extremely tough because it seems that the terrorists 

166.65 171.58 A: seem to be here already or can easily come here at their will 

172.20 172.61 A: and 

172.27 174.75 B: uh i i think they've been here for years uh uh 

174.44 174.94 A: mhm 

175.09 178.87 B: you know i i think that this is not not is just now being orchestrated 

179.06 179.34 B: hm 

179.20 179.64 A: right 

180.31 189.85 A: as far as as much planned that it seemed that nine eleven was um it seems that their forethought in planning these attacks like you say could've been years 

180.36 180.62 B: i (( )) 

189.96 191.32 A: years ago and 

191.86 195.52 A: you know already have a targeted date and if we can prevent that it 

195.62 196.21 A: be 

196.35 196.89 A: having 

197.11 198.75 A: some inside knowledge that 

199.37 201.13 A: i don't know that we could obtain 

201.71 202.98 B: yes i 

203.62 207.37 B: you know i i kind of feel like we're getting a lot of erroneous 

207.47 208.30 B: information 

208.56 209.26 B: at this point 

209.67 210.14 B: the uh 

210.44 213.01 B: the gentleman that they they just arrested 

213.94 217.71 B: i i don't believe that he would tell them the truth on penalty of his life 

217.67 218.07 A: mhm 

218.42 224.08 B: i i think that he would give us as much false information as he could it may be that it may be from that false information 

224.39 225.65 B: we can extract the truth 

225.95 231.12 A: right well i don't think they value life all that much not so much ours but their own even i mean that the 

231.54 233.72 A: that the passion they seem to have for 

234.16 236.27 A: for i don't know if it's passion or hatred 

237.18 238.92 A: or ignorance but they 

239.37 241.83 A: don't seem i don't that we could get it out of them 

242.92 243.35 A: any 

244.26 245.27 A: good reason i mean they 

245.38 247.13 A: have no reason to tell us the truth 

247.24 250.06 B: you know when when you're trained to believe that 

250.24 251.28 B: that honor 

251.65 254.26 B: will will get you in to heaven and that is honor 

254.95 262.09 B: then then it's very difficult to to break that thought i mean it's it's more than just a thought it's more than just an ideal it 

257.52 257.95 A: mhm 

261.77 262.14 A: right 

262.21 263.76 B: it it it's ingrained 

263.76 264.17 A: right 

264.44 265.69 B: in their psyche and and 

266.27 267.59 B: and and perhaps uh that 

267.84 269.91 B: you know we should be more like that perhaps 

270.16 271.61 B: eh you know in some respects 

271.32 272.55 A: in other in other 

272.81 274.70 A: passions or in other 

273.52 273.96 B: right 

275.00 275.82 A: allegiances 

276.01 276.46 B: right 

276.05 276.52 A: rather 

277.16 280.57 A: -cause it just seems so um misdirected i can't see what 

280.71 282.77 A: where their root of 

283.89 286.54 A: logic is coming from to target 

286.92 287.34 A: here 

287.03 287.41 B: well 

287.55 293.23 B: it it it see- seems odd to me that that we've made uh most of those nations wealthy 

294.39 295.53 A: mhm 

294.40 296.22 B: you know by by our use of oil 

296.45 297.42 B: and and and 

297.88 300.67 B: you know we we produce a great of their food huh 

300.46 300.99 A: mhm 

301.19 304.89 B: which is 

301.29 301.54 A: (( )) 

305.13 305.62 A: right 

305.81 307.46 B: and it seems odd that they 

307.55 308.90 B: but but then again you know i 

309.00 311.09 B: and and that's the way people are huh 

311.30 313.05 B: you you always hate the things that 

315.13 316.49 A: bite the hands that feed you 

316.18 317.46 B: yeah i i mean 

317.56 319.60 B: it it's just like most people hate their boss 

319.82 321.83 A: right and he's employed you right 

321.64 324.16 B: r- he he gives you your food every day huh 

323.96 324.54 A: mhm 

324.74 325.38 A: mhm 

324.84 326.35 B: but but yeah you despise him 

326.71 327.43 A: right 

328.29 333.25 A: right but i mean i guess i've never really heard of why they do this like i mean what 

333.35 333.95 A: i mean 

334.07 336.67 A: they think of us as just evil right i mean 

336.44 338.20 B: yeah we're we're a decadent culture 

338.58 341.70 A: and so they they're jealous i mean or i mean 

341.88 344.27 A: to the extent that we shouldn't exist 

345.29 345.68 B: well 

345.39 347.03 A: i mean that we should kill our innocent 

347.48 348.50 A: children and our 

348.63 351.70 A: people that are just living day to day like them 

352.19 353.38 A: seems to odd to me 

353.52 353.95 A: that they're 

354.16 356.26 A: logic could be ingrained in them 

356.42 356.95 A: um 

357.90 359.20 A: that we are so evil 

359.51 359.95 B: yeah i 

360.55 362.52 B: but but you know that that's not just there 

362.83 364.41 B: that you know that's that's in um 

364.78 365.58 B: north korea 

366.28 366.90 A: mhm 

366.90 369.46 B: it is another country that's very much that way 

369.75 373.94 B: and i think that that if the troops were told that the chinese think very much like that 

374.13 374.85 B: about us 

375.19 376.45 A: as inferior and 

378.91 379.27 B: it 

378.94 379.29 A: hm 

379.37 380.74 B: i i i think the whole deal 

382.65 383.70 B: with them is 

384.34 384.80 B: that that 

386.81 390.47 B: they have been the have nots for so long and it appears we are the haves 

390.55 390.97 A: right 

391.17 392.50 B: you know they don't see 

393.30 395.97 B: the normal every day working american 

396.31 400.19 B: who do they see they see the movie stars they see the politicians 

399.06 399.74 A: right 

400.30 401.11 A: right 

400.85 401.15 B: and 

401.38 404.40 B: and there is always a sex scandal going on (( )) 

403.73 404.27 A: sure 

404.90 405.31 B: and 

404.94 405.40 A: right 

405.59 408.20 B: and that's something that they're they are very private about 

408.44 409.13 A: correct 

409.47 412.11 A: so we're we're like a sinful nation to them 

412.21 413.96 B: that's it we're we're los vegas 

414.14 414.74 A: right 

415.00 416.62 A: right since sin city 

416.85 417.58 A: eh just 

417.99 420.04 B: but we do have fun don't we (( you know )) 

420.57 423.04 B: so bomb -em and bring on the bio terrorism 

423.86 425.95 A: yeah right uh that's 

426.25 430.22 A: i i was when i read that question i was thinking gosh i don't 

430.45 434.68 A: the you know i don't know that we could prevent it i mean i know we are putting in different 

435.11 435.69 A: um 

436.19 440.99 A: measures to go over to different places and try to see what they have and try to 

441.75 448.96 A: figure out what they've got but i think you are right when you made your first comment was that we are the ones that give it to -em in the first place and uh 

449.54 451.68 B: well we d- we developed a great deal of of 

451.94 455.94 B: well and and let's face facts the cold war wasn't just nuclear 

456.03 457.33 B: you know there were a lot of uh 

458.30 458.78 B: uh o- 

459.01 459.43 B: of 

459.92 460.78 B: bio 

461.16 461.67 B: you know 

462.31 463.93 B: w- w- what do they call it um 

465.07 467.01 B: bio weapons developed 

467.31 471.09 B: you know over the years you know i i know they talked about that on several 

471.74 474.93 B: several shows i've seen and and i know we've got uh 

475.43 478.77 B: big samples of every disease that's ever existed 

479.18 480.62 B: and like the c._d._c.'s 

481.43 483.65 B: you know they're they're in like cold storage right 

483.73 484.18 A: mhm 

484.43 487.86 B: and they were d- they were discussing at one time what was it was it polio 

488.49 489.68 B: that had been wiped out 

489.78 490.49 B: completely 

491.95 494.53 B: it it was something that had been wiped out completely 

495.03 496.81 B: except for that one sample 

496.94 497.62 B: that they had 

498.01 498.97 A: and they maintained 

499.49 502.85 B: and they they maintained and they were asking whether it should be destroyed 

504.27 505.25 A: it 

504.57 510.34 B: it seems seems to be if you got rid of a scourge why do you want to give it a chance to mutate and start again you know 

508.13 508.79 A: correct 

509.73 511.43 A: correct jeeze 

511.79 516.94 A: that's a scary thought but i bet you you're right i bet you there's all types of of things that have been
