14.57 17.57 A: so we're supposed to talk about what is important to look for in a life partner 

17.59 18.35 B: right 

18.24 19.50 A: okay are you married 

19.90 20.28 B: no 

21.31 21.76 A: i am 

22.03 25.34 A: okay (( )) i'll tell you what i think is important 

22.29 23.14 B: you are 

23.57 25.23 B: so what did you look for 

25.65 26.28 B: right 

26.39 30.59 A: uh my husband is sitting here too so he'll get educated um 

30.73 32.51 A: i think um probably 

32.76 37.20 A: life goals is one of the most important things and wanting the same things in your future 

39.14 40.31 B: yeah 

39.83 44.61 A: whether you want kids or want to settle down in a house or if you want to travel or you know 

45.05 47.28 B: so you don't think some of those would change 

45.12 45.55 A: (( )) 

48.62 49.79 A: they probably change 

49.99 50.35 A: but 

51.48 55.41 A: i don't know there's some you know if you know that you don't kids or you know you don't want to 

56.58 59.29 A: live in a city or something that might not change so 

59.40 60.48 B: not well that is true 

61.80 64.39 B: what about goals in terms of 

64.61 76.11 B: one person completely believing that they want to do one thing and then all of a sudden they change their mind but that is what both of you decided that is what you were going to set your mind to 

78.88 79.73 A: uh 

80.24 81.94 A: yeah i well i have a friend who uh 

82.46 83.09 A: was convinced 

83.20 84.72 A: so that she did not want to have kids 

85.47 91.38 A: her husband we all knew he wanted to have kids before they even got married and she's turned around and now they have a daughter so 

91.97 95.08 A: i guess that can work out if you don't have the same goals but for me 

94.76 95.07 B: (( )) 

95.91 96.90 A: i would i couldn't 

97.46 97.96 A: i couldn't have 

98.07 100.10 A: settled for you know gone into something like that 

100.97 102.00 B: that makes sense 

102.42 103.53 B: makes a lot of sense 

107.90 108.82 A: (( )) 

109.25 112.35 B: right because eventually you are going to get to a point 

112.63 115.17 B: where you are going to disagree on certain things and 

116.33 118.46 B: it would be hard to 

118.74 119.28 B: um 

120.23 122.13 B: i guess compromise on certain things 

123.30 124.26 B: that is why 

124.38 126.73 B: divorce is as high as it is 

126.94 127.71 B: these days 

128.10 129.43 B: so how long have you been married 

130.24 131.05 A: eight and a half years 

131.37 133.20 B: oh so that is a long time 

133.62 134.63 A: yeah i think we 

137.01 137.87 B: that is good 

139.66 140.98 B: do you have kids of your own 

145.70 146.23 B: wow 

146.77 147.98 A: well that was something that kind of 

148.91 152.12 A: changed along the way we knew we were going to have kids but you know the number 

152.72 153.31 B: right 

153.69 154.10 A: kind of 

154.42 157.30 A: have to wait -til you have one and figure out 

157.15 158.18 B: right right 

157.48 158.47 A: how that goes 

158.65 159.18 B: right 

159.68 163.71 B: -cause i think that definitely can change i i initially didn't want any kids 

163.82 174.21 B: and i have one i don't want another one but no i don't but if i you know everybody always tells me you know if you decide to 

167.50 168.12 A: (( nah )) 

174.36 174.65 B: (( )) 

174.86 176.09 B: be back married 

175.10 175.35 A: (( )) 

176.59 177.50 B: then 

177.61 180.07 B: you know you might change your mind but 

181.16 183.05 B: as of right now umhum 

185.78 187.57 A: another life thing that you know you have to 

192.48 193.31 B: oh okay 

199.48 199.99 B: i think 

201.13 203.79 A: right and i just didn't want to leave him 

201.70 202.70 B: right right 

203.99 204.26 A: so 

204.65 205.61 A: i don't know 

205.76 206.98 B: well that is a good thing 

206.38 207.08 A: but um 

207.28 209.14 A: yeah so i mean i guess that could have been 

208.67 211.09 B: but that is a hard compromise within itself 

209.80 212.06 A: that could have been a big stumbling block yeah 

211.81 212.45 B: yeah 

212.41 212.72 A: but 

213.07 216.00 B: a really hard compromise because you initially 

216.26 217.03 B: um 

217.22 218.81 B: think that you know 

219.32 220.06 A: exactly 

219.67 222.23 B: what kind of lifestyle you are going to have and 

222.88 224.69 B: the lifestyle will include 

224.84 225.30 B: you know 

225.61 227.18 B: both parties working or not 

232.75 233.65 B: yeah 

233.11 233.41 A: would 

234.27 235.56 A: always still that it would be nice 

237.40 237.79 B: right 

238.36 241.67 B: but you can look there's alternative ways to have income always 

238.37 239.12 A: but then (( )) 

241.83 244.68 A: you know like the cell phone call thing 

243.60 244.74 B: yes 

245.04 250.01 B: that of of many things and there are a lot of things that you can do from the house 

250.12 250.49 A: yeah 

250.16 252.87 B: and you probably save money on child care so 

252.89 255.09 A: well that is part yeah that was a big part of it 

255.22 255.83 B: yeah 

255.23 257.63 A: more than more than one kid in child care and 

255.95 256.60 B: (( even to )) 

257.89 258.48 B: right 

258.37 259.10 A: all that just 

261.23 261.57 B: yup 

261.80 262.61 B: and (( )) (( and it )) 

261.89 262.60 A: now what state 

262.72 263.34 A: do you live in 

263.67 264.22 B: florida 

264.48 264.94 A: florida 

265.28 265.71 B: mhm 

266.66 269.67 B: oh really i was assuming that everybody was in the same state 

269.91 271.20 A: oh really no 

270.86 272.76 B: yeah no well i'm in florida 

273.33 274.96 B: and child care is expensive 

275.14 275.65 A: oh yeah 

276.25 276.69 B: so 

278.43 279.37 B: -cause you want to (( )) 

278.93 279.22 A: the 

279.36 281.80 A: we did that for a year and that was uh 

282.58 286.39 A: that was you know just felt like a big chunk of money every month 

286.14 289.34 B: it is it is so you have a little baby 

289.85 292.29 A: yeah he is nursing right now i have a 

291.87 292.69 B: yeah 

292.43 293.80 A: three month old and 

293.85 294.95 B: wow 

294.38 295.34 A: my oldest is six 

296.40 297.25 B: wow 

298.33 299.04 A: how old is yours 

299.29 299.86 B: two 

301.02 304.75 B: yeah but he nursed for a long time he nursed until he was ten months 

301.63 302.30 A: so (( )) 

304.81 305.23 A: yeah 

305.70 306.16 B: yeah 

305.93 306.26 A: great 

307.07 311.69 A: yeah that is what i would do go as long as i can so 

310.57 317.17 B: yeah it's it's really good for the kids that's something you know and that you have to agree with before you 

317.49 319.64 B: get married as well because 

318.95 319.47 A: yeah 

319.81 321.45 B: some people don't agree with nursing 

321.65 324.40 A: yeah that which i can't understand at all but yeah 

324.26 325.11 B: me either 

324.68 329.71 A: but some men are weird about it yeah (( )) 

326.41 326.88 B: yup 

327.38 330.32 B: yup and some men are real territorial 

330.48 331.13 A: yeah 

330.60 331.87 B: so they look at 

332.40 334.39 B: their wife as theirs 

334.55 335.37 A: exac- yeah 

335.61 338.21 B: and it's hard for them to watch their child 

338.13 339.10 A: yeah (( )) 

338.51 339.19 B: nursing 

339.29 342.36 A: why uh -cause they sexualize everything 

341.52 343.27 B: right right right 

343.50 343.91 A: yeah 

344.20 345.06 A: but no 

344.51 346.59 B: so that is something you have to to talk about 

345.54 350.84 A: my husband doesn't mind it it means he doesn't have to get up in the night so 

348.98 349.78 B: yeah 

350.79 351.42 B: yeah 

351.02 353.10 A: that is good for him (( )) 

352.38 355.67 B: and then some men feel like um they don't have a part 

356.01 357.94 B: if they can't feed their child 

356.50 363.58 A: that is true i i know like in terms like grandparents also my mom would love it if she could give him a bottle sometimes and stuff but 

362.94 363.62 B: yeah 

364.30 366.45 A: that is not what we do so my sister is 

366.72 370.45 A: using a bottle with her little girl so she gets to do it with her 

369.83 371.13 B: how old is her little girl 

371.63 372.11 A: five months 

372.56 375.31 B: oh so you all were pregnant about the same time 

373.77 374.44 A: yes 

374.66 376.03 A: yeah yeah 

375.81 377.08 B: that is really neat 

379.66 380.96 B: they will grow up together 

383.92 388.83 A: i wonder how much we are supposed to stay on to- on topic or if that's part of the whole phone conver- the 

389.91 391.03 B: i don't know 

392.44 393.63 B: i don't know 

394.11 395.51 B: i didn't get much guidance 

395.76 396.91 A: no umhum 

395.84 396.26 B: (( )) 

396.71 398.18 B: when i started it so 

398.38 399.08 A: it's like (( i think )) 

399.87 401.04 A: supposed to just give you a a 

401.53 402.10 A: starting off 

402.21 402.53 A: point 

403.02 404.49 B: and then you go from there 

404.10 405.18 A: yeah i guess so 

408.16 409.51 A: so were you married before 

409.92 410.24 A: (( i don't )) 

409.94 411.42 B: i was yes 

410.65 411.19 A: you were 

411.31 411.59 A: (( )) 

411.80 412.16 A: (( )) 

412.32 413.28 A: and 

413.28 415.62 B: mhm not for very long though so 

413.90 416.39 A: not for very long yeah 

416.15 416.65 B: no 

416.96 417.54 B: no 

417.16 417.56 A: was it 

417.68 419.62 A: something that changed in (( )) in what 

420.35 421.63 B: i think it was the 

420.55 423.25 A: so you had gone in to know- you know knowing 

422.61 427.01 B: i i think that i probably knew a lot of the um 

424.48 424.82 A: (( oh )) 

427.31 430.38 B: the things that would make us in incompatible 

428.54 429.21 A: (( mhm )) 

429.40 429.81 A: (( out of )) 

430.51 431.51 B: but ignored them 

431.75 435.01 B: for the sake of you know i've been with him for so long that the next 

435.51 437.17 B: automatic step was marriage 

435.67 437.57 A: that was just the next thing to do right 

437.79 438.29 A: yeah 

438.36 438.96 B: so 

439.14 443.08 B: but i think we are better off now that is what kind of scares me about 

439.23 440.03 A: yeah 

443.26 444.14 A: (( )) 

443.26 445.38 B: marriage because i did know him for so long 

444.34 445.41 A: of a (( )) 

445.62 446.16 A: uh-huh 

446.48 448.20 B: and now you know we are 

446.99 447.89 A: yeah (( )) 

448.26 449.57 A: did you live together 

448.40 450.68 B: running back and forth to court huh 

450.49 452.04 A: did you live together or anything 

451.65 453.41 B: not before we were married no 

454.10 455.10 A: (( that's not )) 

454.31 456.11 B: that is something that um 

455.22 456.21 A: (( )) 

456.94 458.99 B: that a lot of people think helps 

457.39 458.52 A: why people think 

459.17 459.95 A: yeah 

459.49 461.58 B: is living together prior to marriage 

461.40 461.83 A: yeah 

462.87 465.57 B: so maybe i will try that next time if i ever 

465.60 466.20 A: yeah 

466.05 467.20 B: decide to get married again 

466.58 467.59 A: and it probably doesn't hurt 

467.71 471.07 A: but you know 

468.33 469.94 B: yeah -cause at least you know 

470.92 474.25 B: certain things about each other that you wouldn't know 

472.47 473.55 A: right yeah 

474.07 480.73 A: well i had so many roommates and i had the hardest time with roommates so it's reassuring to know that i can live with somebody 

479.91 481.39 B: well yeah 

481.62 485.60 B: yeah i've never had too many problems with roommates but 

481.83 482.47 A: but uh 

482.65 483.59 A: (( )) 

485.11 486.14 A: (( )) 

486.48 490.03 B: i did and had even lived with um male friends before but 

489.57 489.96 A: (( but )) 

490.93 492.37 B: wow it just was different 

493.82 499.73 B: and then the scary part of it is when what comes with divorce is you know court battles and 

499.82 500.94 A: right 

500.01 503.34 B: child custody and that kind of thing so 

501.79 502.24 A: (( )) 

503.43 504.35 A: still dealing with it 

504.58 506.35 B: oh yeah and it's been two years 

507.73 508.23 B: so 

509.14 511.45 B: yup back and forth to court still 

512.48 513.18 B: it does 

513.32 515.74 B: and it is sad for the you know for the kids 

516.87 524.47 B: that they have to kind of be stuck in the middle so that is what makes you know picking the life partner that much more crucial if you are going to have kids involved
