60.60 61.27 A: that brat 

61.88 66.97 B: yeah i know what you mean um or even exam- for the example of the osbournes i don't know why famous people 

67.38 70.26 B: would want to put themselves so 

70.89 71.83 B: i don't know i guess it's 

71.94 73.15 B: to make money or 

73.62 74.27 B: and i 

73.71 74.40 A: i don't know 

74.72 75.39 B: i suppose it 

75.51 76.70 B: boosts their career 

77.69 79.74 A: i think so i think in that case it was the 

80.00 80.63 A: (( enrati )) 

81.14 83.86 A: a lot of -em are uh they do it for their mhm like the um 

85.98 86.41 A: um 

86.71 87.10 A: think about 

87.43 89.34 A: i haven't watched a lot of their shows but like i watched 

89.89 90.47 A: part of the s- 

90.76 92.24 A: shows for that joe millionaire 

92.52 94.40 B: mhm yeah i watched some of those too 

94.90 99.66 A: but i think i think a lot of the girls in that one did it for the chance to um 

100.16 100.88 A: like maybe 

101.27 102.58 A: get a break 

102.86 103.21 A: um 

103.39 104.95 A: like in their c- their career like 

105.57 108.60 A: or make money or marry money or whatever but like 

108.91 111.44 A: but the one girl that was like the runner up or whatever 

111.49 111.96 B: mhm 

111.80 114.44 A: it came out that she you know she had been in um 

115.21 116.62 A: earlier had been in uh 

117.29 117.79 A: some kind of 

118.47 119.80 A: porn movies or somethin- 

119.47 119.88 B: oh 

120.38 121.43 B: oh no 

120.85 121.50 A: i'd heard 

122.29 126.80 A: yeah so i think i mean i she she probably did it for like her career and stuff 

126.74 127.99 B: yeah yeah 

128.41 128.98 B: um 

130.56 137.94 B: or then the people that do it and they aren't famous before hand sometimes like joe millionaire that guy he was on another 

136.08 136.52 A: right 

138.15 139.72 B: show and it it does 

139.86 147.01 B: put them more in the public eye and i guess make them famous for the time being but at the same time it seems as though they're being mocked 

147.12 147.61 B: by 

148.14 149.14 B: a lot of people 

149.79 150.40 B: so 

151.14 151.70 B: um 

151.44 153.67 A: i think -cause like i like a lot of people either um 

155.43 158.67 A: ha- hate it or love it as as far as what they tell people 

158.88 159.25 B: mhm 

158.95 161.28 A: but then i think you know the people that swear they hate it 

161.61 166.78 A: they have this secret fascination and and sometimes even watch it to see what's going on i know this one girl that 

167.22 169.59 A: was like really on her her boyfriend for 

169.79 176.22 A: for watching joe millionaire and stuff -cause he was like a really educated and had a really good job or whatever and he was fascinated with this this 

176.59 180.59 A: co- kind of cheesy concept for this show or whatever and but then 

179.45 179.98 B: mhm 

181.12 182.08 A: she would like 

182.29 191.14 A: what happened what you know what happened the last show or whatever but yet she would be down on him for watching it or whatever but she would kind of fascinated with it a little bit too you know so i don't know 

191.47 195.18 B: yeah i i watched a couple shows that i won't openly admit that i watched 

195.32 198.09 B: them um but 

196.39 196.94 A: yeah 

198.27 200.35 B: it's it's kind of um 

201.46 201.91 B: it's 

202.07 203.90 B: an interesting concept 

204.10 205.39 B: that i don't know i 

205.65 207.00 B: forgot what i was going to say but 

207.47 207.97 B: um 

210.70 211.26 B: that 

212.43 214.20 B: oh i don't even remember what i was going to say 

214.47 214.95 B: but 

215.89 217.87 A: i don't know i just i don't even want to do it 

218.03 218.76 A: i um 

219.47 222.31 A: i guess i'm a very private person i wouldn't want to go on one of those shows 

222.82 223.27 B: right 

223.02 224.10 A: necessarily 

224.40 226.19 A: if they were going to find out you know all my 

226.32 228.02 A: you know things about my life or 

228.57 229.18 A: and just 

229.45 233.83 A: kind of expose it in whatever light they want or whatever spin they wanted to put on it you know because 

233.43 234.03 B: right 

234.67 237.04 A: um they don't show everything and you know 

237.34 238.47 A: and it just makes you wonder 

239.22 240.05 A: but some of the 

240.38 243.70 A: i haven't seen a lot of -em but like they mention that on the topics about 

243.91 245.21 A: like survivor or whatever 

245.84 246.83 A: i never really could get int- 

247.31 247.76 A: those 

248.34 248.94 B: yeah 

248.50 249.01 A: shows 

249.84 250.66 A: yeah the 

252.34 253.74 A: i don't know 

255.46 256.14 B: yeah i 

256.44 257.04 B: or like 

257.27 261.98 B: with the osbournes i don't know i guess well it boosted one of their daughter's careers like she 

262.26 262.98 B: can't really 

263.20 263.54 B: sing 

263.59 264.11 A: right 

264.33 265.33 B: and 

264.74 265.32 A: yeah 

265.49 271.66 B: she's totally got a career out of it now and very much in the public eye and i i suppose um 

273.21 273.94 B: um 

274.75 275.15 B: it's just 

275.46 277.19 B: a way i don't it's i gue- 

277.43 278.01 B: it's a 

278.69 281.53 B: the reason why probably a lot of people do it and i know i do it 

281.67 282.49 B: just mindless 

282.66 288.16 B: entertainment gets you to do something or not really do something but it's you know a form to like 

285.81 286.61 A: right 

288.59 295.90 B: not really have to think about much of anything and you're watching other people's lives and maybe it makes you feel better about your own life because you're not there 

295.36 301.77 A: i think you mi- i think you may be right with that because yeah you can kind of compare your life to theirs and kind of see how they relate 

302.42 307.67 A: and you can say well i don't do that i'm not dressed like that or whatever you know or 

307.17 307.74 B: right 

307.79 308.37 A: or 

309.17 309.92 A: whatever 

309.26 309.67 B: or 

310.18 312.78 B: or like with joe millionaire i would watch um 

319.87 320.48 A: right 

322.67 323.47 B: yet 

323.68 326.26 B: that sort of thing it was really funny 

326.36 330.60 B: but um and you know what i live with a lot of international students and 

331.18 331.59 A: uh-huh 

333.26 333.79 A: oh really 

339.99 341.30 B: they would sit there and watch it 

340.18 340.63 A: uh-huh 

341.66 345.54 B: and when my friend from my house mate from um the u._k. she was 

345.90 348.40 B: like oh that's a bunch of bunch of rubbish but she'd 

348.51 348.91 B: still 

349.76 351.10 B: still watch it somewhat 

352.12 352.64 A: yeah 

352.89 358.02 B: so it's it's not i guess just america that would that takes interest in it i don't know 

358.94 360.21 A: i think you're right um 

361.74 363.32 A: i was trying to think what other reality 

363.54 366.45 A: (( reality )) reality based t._v. shows there are but 

366.76 368.73 A: um i know the mentioned survivor 

369.64 371.82 A: and who wants to marry a millionaire but i didn't watch 

371.93 372.63 A: that 

372.79 374.85 B: i didn't watch that either there is um 

375.40 377.56 B: there's one that's coming up i guess that's um 

378.80 382.07 B: uh married by america or something 

382.83 384.24 A: oh i saw a part of that 

384.46 384.74 A: i 

385.11 386.19 A: do you think i don't know 

386.49 389.65 A: for sure is that considered reality based because it's kind 

390.53 394.00 A: when i watched it it looks almost like a game show format because they had 

393.52 394.18 B: oh really 

394.61 397.29 A: well they had like an audience and they had the people there 

397.39 399.16 A: uh but kind of like um 

400.69 403.61 A: oh what's that one where the people see you compete for 

403.93 404.52 B: oh 

404.06 405.47 A: american idol or 

405.14 406.12 B: yeah yeah 

406.45 410.95 A: it was kind of like that because they were they were inter- it was interactive interview of the people there 

410.51 411.22 B: oh 

411.18 412.44 A: in front of an audience 

413.14 413.98 A: and 

414.58 414.84 A: there 

415.03 416.09 A: they would have like 

417.12 420.76 A: members of the person that was going to get married's family and friends 

421.22 422.17 A: questioning like 

422.35 424.25 A: three prospective people that 

424.47 426.48 A: they would choose for them to marry this person 

427.38 427.81 B: uh-huh 

427.52 428.02 A: and 

428.70 430.64 A: and there would be in america voted on 

431.65 433.42 A: they narrowed it down to three people 

433.72 434.31 A: and then 

435.88 437.05 A: the family friends around it 

437.65 442.58 A: narrowed it down to two and then america you voted got to vote by phone 

442.95 444.28 A: between two people 

445.07 448.75 A: and then like the next week would that would say which one won or whatever but 

449.27 452.16 A: that's just the one part of the show i saw i i wasn't really 

453.63 454.94 A: didn't really get into it really 

455.25 457.33 B: yeah i don't i don't know exactly what 

457.50 460.48 B: if that would be considered reality based or not then 

460.63 461.31 B: but um 

461.77 463.63 B: yeah the full concept i guess it it 

464.97 466.50 B: i guess it's good for like the 

466.68 476.76 B: t._v. industry to have the (( real- )) reality based shows because it does pull in a lot of viewers for who knows why i don't know why i watch it but or not consistently but 

477.36 478.16 B: you know when i do wa- 

477.55 478.32 A: i also heard that 

478.53 483.22 A: yeah i also heard that that it's very inexpensive shows actually to produce in the long run 

483.67 484.42 A: if um 

485.42 486.71 A: that's one of the reasons that that 

487.22 488.56 A: the stations like it because 

488.83 489.59 A: they can um 

490.97 492.88 A: it's not an expensive show to produce 

494.59 495.31 B: that makes sense 

498.60 499.32 A: but um 

501.12 501.64 A: i guess 

502.24 505.50 A: i guess i'm into some of it and some of it i'm not depending on what it is 

505.72 506.42 A: you know the 

506.27 506.72 B: well yeah 

507.88 508.36 A: um 

509.42 510.75 A: that anna nicole show 

510.92 511.69 B: oh yeah 

511.85 514.13 A: is that a reality i guess that would be considered one 

513.46 513.98 B: yeah 

515.69 516.86 A: that's just something else 

517.30 523.49 B: i know i know i i wonder why they air that sometimes although you know what i i i do 

523.93 528.04 B: watch it when like when it's on t._v. i'll sit there and watch it and be like hm that's in- 

527.52 531.87 A: i will i will too (( if i'm )) flipping channels and i come across it i'll watch it i mean i don't make a point to 

532.18 537.66 A: oh thursday night or whatever time is anna nicole i don't do that but if i find it i'll wa- sit and watch it 

534.55 535.32 B: right i 

538.20 538.82 A: i think it's just 

539.40 540.42 A: i think i'm just so 

541.48 542.77 A: amazed and 

543.66 544.04 A: at 

544.40 546.89 A: the things that go on 

545.90 547.81 B: i know i know what you mean 

547.01 549.56 A: i was like i would sit there with my mouth open or something 

551.08 552.96 A: the guy that was decorating her house 

552.95 555.51 B: oh oh my goodness that was so funny 

553.07 553.60 A: and stuff 

556.40 558.31 B: i kno- yeah i don't know why 

559.46 565.67 B: like why somebody would want to do that it doesn't i don't know if she doesn't watch herself after she
