133.70 134.17 A: that's good 

133.72 142.63 B: uh i like thanksgiving and christmas because that's the time that our entire family gets together but i probably like thanksgiving better just cause it doesn't seem as 

139.17 139.56 A: right 

143.36 148.43 B: stressful and busy and you don't have to i mean it's just kind of relaxed 

145.69 146.06 A: right 

148.93 149.36 A: right 

149.37 149.80 B: um it's 

150.28 153.84 B: and thanksgiving is always more casual for our family and it's just kind of 

154.96 156.72 B: nice and relaxing and 

156.98 159.04 B: good to have all the family together 

159.09 162.59 A: (( )) thanksgiving runs right up there in my 

163.17 163.74 A: three list

164.93 166.07 A: it has to uh 

167.25 171.21 A: i don't know for me christmas is dependent a little bit too commercial 

171.49 172.66 B: you're right 

172.45 175.83 A: i really don't celebrate the gift giving on christmas uh 

176.34 176.99 A: well i 

177.32 178.89 A: not as much these days 

179.47 180.03 B: yeah 

179.82 182.69 A: eh you know seems like people are invading (( )) 

183.20 184.56 A: the purpose of christmas 

184.91 185.37 B: right 

187.93 188.22 A: you got 

188.34 192.04 A: santa getting more attention than jesus you know thi- th- that's a problem 

192.27 198.87 B: exactly exactly i don't think kids understand what christmas is about anymore 

198.70 204.25 A: well ye- yeah i mean you'll sit there and it- it's like you'll ask a child 

204.60 207.97 A: what are you expecting for christmas uh you know what do you expect for christmas santa 

208.77 209.65 B: yeah 

210.03 212.22 A: and uh you know it- it's really 

212.70 216.24 A: the the commercialization of christmas is very 

217.29 218.25 A: it's appalling 

218.46 219.15 B: yeah 

218.81 219.63 A: it really is 

220.75 223.57 A: uh i mean this is (( )) 

223.87 224.41 A: really 

226.11 227.71 A: so if you had to pick a second 

228.04 228.75 A: holiday 

229.11 229.79 A: which would it be 

230.55 231.25 B: uh huh ah 

232.66 237.79 B: i would probably have to say christmas but i mean i do agree that it 

237.93 240.33 B: too commercial and we try very hard to 

240.98 242.46 B: you know make sure 

242.82 245.26 B: we remember the meaning of christmas and we 

245.95 246.85 B: try and keep it 

247.03 248.20 B: mild you know 

248.42 249.19 A: right right 

249.01 253.29 B: but uh and i don't like all the weeks that lead up to christmas but 

253.26 254.68 A: oh man 

253.72 260.78 B: christmas day is nice when we have everybody together and we always read the christmas story from the bible and things like that 

261.10 262.62 B: so it's nice 

263.23 270.39 A: talking about the weeks before christmas the weeks that you spend all your savings of the year yeah 

263.24 263.59 B: and 

267.48 270.08 B: that's right 

270.42 271.76 B: er the w- we 

272.02 279.18 B: just try and scramble to find and it i it's hard cause you feel like you can't even spend time finding just the right gift you just try and find something 

279.13 279.93 A: exactly 

279.80 280.76 B: to give 

281.56 283.92 B: so what would your second favorite be 

284.20 286.21 A: oh my second favorite would 

286.41 286.90 A: have 

287.00 288.60 A: to be uh 

289.19 290.20 A: independence day 

291.10 291.94 B: and why is that 

291.19 296.73 A: not not not so far as patriotism well it's two days out of my birthday for one 

296.89 298.07 B: oh 

300.23 305.16 A: and like you know it's it's really like the only holiday in the middle of the summer 

305.76 306.49 A: and 

306.86 307.60 A: you know 

308.16 315.44 A: when i when i was younger you know of course it meant nothing because you know you're off for the summer and everything but to get off from a job like two days 

315.55 318.22 A: (( )) you know i can kind of 

318.65 321.31 A: call sick on the day after my birthday so i get 

322.00 324.77 B: so it's the day off that matters 

324.48 331.83 A: yes yes yes i i and then you get a chance to just really uh i think i spend more time with my friends eh 

332.00 335.29 A: more so than my family or anything 

335.51 337.87 A: independence day go out barbecue uh 

337.53 338.58 B: yeah 

338.39 340.44 A: catch some games at the park 

340.58 342.76 A: and then the fireworks don't hurt either you know 

342.76 343.65 B: right 

343.56 345.14 A: down here in georgia we 

345.31 347.90 A: it is illegal to have fireworks 

348.21 348.71 A: so 

348.22 349.27 B: even in the city 

349.74 351.75 A: yeah well i mean uh 

351.52 351.87 B: like 

352.11 354.57 B: not firecrackers but like a firework show

360.79 364.66 A: you know and in and in your own backyard (( )) 

364.83 366.86 A: although we do it sometimes you know 

367.51 368.07 A: uh

375.00 375.38 A: uh 

376.99 377.94 A: so

384.53 388.26 A: i don't know um if i could invent a holiday 

388.80 390.16 A: it would be 

393.28 394.44 A: employee day 

394.61 398.62 B: employee day instead of a boss's day that's a good idea 

397.76 399.44 A: yeah i mean 

399.62 400.53 A: you you know um 

401.18 404.34 A: a lot of people a lot of bosses i i don't know if you

427.74 429.76 A: uh change and switch (( )) 

429.21 429.75 B: hm mhm

460.39 462.03 B: you know it's just kind of a nice 

462.77 468.24 B: thing and so we invented kid's day and i i you know i think kid's day would be a good day to have 

464.27 465.03 A: (( ))
