24.75 32.91 B: yeah i've watched every single reality show myself that exists [laughter] so i'm a big junkie myself i love reality 

29.00 30.88 A: oh my golly gee 

31.32 32.20 A: (( holy [mn] )) 

32.99 35.83 A: call call call call her ms reality 

35.36 38.18 B: oh yes [laughter] i don't miss any of 

36.45 37.79 A: (( ah we- we- )) 

38.70 39.53 B: (( them )) 

38.73 40.82 A: we- well what do you think of them well 

40.22 54.81 B: [laughter] i love them i mean it it's just something different you know regular t._v. you've got scripts people telling you what to say reality is real people just like our neighbors you know our relatives and it's people doing real things that's what attracts my attention you know 

54.96 62.62 A: i i i don't know i mean i watched this this um joe millionaire thing and you've got this really studly guy 

62.36 63.29 B: mhm 

62.66 75.65 A: and these twenty gorgeous women i mean that's th- the g- i i don't know any girls [mn] well maybe one girl at work [laughter] that comes close to that i mean they're all models ah actors actresses 

70.83 71.52 B: (( right )) 

75.51 81.56 B: well yeah they they of course they selectively [mn] was really selective about the women on that show and 

80.89 82.14 A: yes 

81.83 93.88 B: that's more for just entertainment purposes you know in my in my opinion that's more like a t._v. that they're they're telling 'em what to do even though it's real people they are like you said they're they're more selective with those shows 

83.87 85.87 A: mhm 

93.50 95.43 A: mhm 

94.06 102.28 B: and i think that is just more for just laughable you know ha this is funny i can't believe that people would be ch- pining over somebody like this 

101.77 103.54 A: (( [laughter] )) 

102.36 110.06 B: so that's the reason i like those just for the pure fact that i can't believe people would do this you know [laughter] so that's what drives that 

107.47 108.34 A: (( uh )) 

108.36 111.95 A: now now what do you have you thought of survivor so far 

111.70 113.96 B: um it depends on the season 

113.72 114.78 A: okay 

114.16 120.20 B: yeah each season is different the last season i did not enjoy it was rather boring 

120.05 121.17 A: okay 

120.55 122.89 B: but i stuck through it you know i 

122.99 128.90 B: i'm just that i'm loyal to a show if i like the first two or three seasons i'm gonna stick with it and try another one 

128.95 132.02 B: and ah this season i like it again it's 

131.32 139.11 A: [mn] well i ah i i like the fact i liked you know i watched the first survivor mostly all the way through and ah i 

139.18 143.28 A: like when they have people on there like ah well i li- i liked rudy 

143.05 144.24 B: [laughter] yeah 

143.56 153.34 A: because he was he was a regular kinda guy i mean when you think of a survivor that's what i think of [laughter] he could've [laughter] survived anything you know 

146.83 147.75 B: mhm 

149.89 151.29 B: exactly 

152.91 156.52 B: [laughter] oh yeah i w- i do wish they would do it a little bit more 

156.62 159.70 B: survivalistic towards personally 

159.55 161.30 A: right where [mn] 

159.92 168.40 B: everything is such a group effort but that doesn't mean you can actually survive what if you went out there and and had them ha- had to make their own beds you know 

168.26 170.03 A: sure yeah 

168.30 180.80 B: [laughter] so i mean that's one thing i think that if they did a reality show they could improve on it by simply making it be more of a personal issue with survivor who really are true survivors you know 

177.87 179.34 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

179.72 182.70 A: it's it's now more like gilligan's island 

181.93 193.63 B: yeah yeah and it's just ha ha [laughter] although this season the men and the women against each other is making it harder for the women it's making them have to learn things that they're not used to having to do 

182.91 184.34 A: [laughter] 

184.92 185.99 A: (( [laughter] )) 

193.51 195.07 A: (( right that [laughter] right i )) 

193.95 204.09 B: so obviously they're not making good beds [laughter] so um they're having a problem but it makes it more interesting because they're they're not expected to do this they didn't expect to have to do this 

196.56 198.73 A: (( and it's like fallen into their hands i've gotta make )) 

203.89 205.52 A: (( a fire i've gotta make a you know )) 

208.64 214.30 A: shelter i think that was a great idea on part to ah separate it into guys and gals 

210.44 211.40 B: yeah 

213.75 215.93 B: mhm i loved the idea 

215.41 226.12 A: i think he uh that was a real uh winner because you get the ah you you you ah got a lotta the guys watching hey the cat fight oh they're yelling at each other again 

225.28 239.93 B: [mn] ah and and and of of course people like the flirting and you don't get that when they live together guys and girls live together in reality don't get along as well as if they're separated and they're wanting to be near each other so you're getting more flirting in that kinda 

230.65 231.70 A: mhm 

238.67 243.32 A: unl- unless you get with the one gay girl in there or whatever yeah [laughter] 

242.04 244.85 B: i [mn] i didn't even realize there was um 

244.13 247.85 A: no i'm just i'm kidding i don't think there is any but 

245.18 246.38 B: oh oh 

247.24 254.50 B: i don't think it would be a problem anyway you know they're too busy worrying about surviving and trying to like i said they're trying to stay dry every night 

248.93 250.58 A: [laughter] 

253.53 255.01 A: sure sure 

254.73 257.26 B: um did you watch big brother

307.15 319.84 B: right but yeah it it was fun to see how all those different people interacted with each other and it's like you didn't expect these people to end up friends by the end of the show but they were i mean they actually kinda had a friendship and it was pretty cool

335.36 348.71 B: [laughter] i should've guessed it from the some of the things she did but that's a good little show because you have to if at home you can't really do that show i mean it's not something you can guess because you can't like write down on a piece of paper everything about everybody but ah
