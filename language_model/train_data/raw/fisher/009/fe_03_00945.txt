323.60 325.08 A: (( well let's see )) 

325.66 330.95 A: ah we could have a parade [cough] and everybody could show how cute their babies are 

330.81 332.20 B: (( [laughter] )) 

331.62 334.20 A: (( and ah )) 

335.10 338.30 A: make dog treats you know 

338.56 339.37 B: yeah 

339.17 343.09 A: you know cheap and inexpensive or something i don't know 

343.07 351.89 B: oh i totally hear you i grew up around buffalo and ah one of the the local supermarkets used to get involved with the s._p._c._a. and every summer 

352.14 366.77 B: they would have a day in one of the big parks down town and everybody would bring their dog and they would give out little treats and things like that and it was it was similar to that like a little parade there was little outfits on half the dogs so it was a ton of fun i actually worked it a couple of years 

355.25 355.92 A: oh 

360.84 361.83 A: yeah 

366.38 367.39 A: yeah 

366.78 373.00 B: 'cause i worked for a company that handed out some of the stuff at the things but you know it was so much fun all the people bringing their dogs out 

372.75 374.32 A: yeah we had uh 

374.68 378.02 A: here where i live we had a they called it 

378.23 379.00 A: (( ah )) 

379.05 380.74 A: doggy poker 

381.04 381.71 B: (( [laughter] )) 

381.21 383.49 A: i said what is doggy poker 

383.63 388.43 A: and ah the animal shelter humane society the animal shelter 

388.59 393.34 A: ran this event and you would take your dog and you ra- walked for 

393.53 397.84 A: i think it was like a mile and a half or something like that or maybe two miles at the most 

397.94 402.23 A: and there were different stations around and when you got to each station 

402.49 408.76 A: you picked out an envelope and inside that envelope was a card a playing card 

408.96 410.91 A: [mn] and then when you got back 

411.08 413.34 A: to the animal shelter 

413.44 415.40 A: you had five envelopes 

415.44 421.85 A: and so they'd open the envelopes and see what kind of hand you got so it was just total luck of the draw 

422.05 428.12 A: and i think they gave away like a hundred dollars or something for the best hand 

427.98 428.61 B: oh 

428.61 429.73 A: and that was 

428.72 431.51 B: that's kind of a really good idea though 

431.04 437.56 A: yeah it made 'em money and it was just fun and everybody was out there with their dogs walking their dogs and 

436.95 438.06 B: (( mhm )) 

437.78 442.63 A: and doing that kind of stuff so it was it was it was g- it was fun i'd do it again 

442.72 444.51 B: [laughter] 

443.24 444.24 A: i think it's 

444.55 447.75 A: i think that was the second annual doggy poker 

448.01 449.69 A: so i think it 

448.90 450.59 B: and now who did that 

450.48 456.81 A: it was the uh humane society you know the animal shelter and the humane society together 

456.83 460.95 B: oh wow that is a great idea i've never heard of that before 

457.75 458.59 A: yeah 

460.66 466.88 A: yeah i hadn't either and it- it's just kinda interesting to see what you do you know you just 

466.94 471.01 A: you may get something i got nothing [laughter] 

469.60 472.78 B: [laughter] did you take all five of your dogs 

473.06 476.19 A: ah that no we just took two 

476.30 478.20 B: [laughter] 

477.07 481.11 A: 'cause there was only two of us we weren't we got one um 

481.21 483.19 A: one of the pound dogs 

483.48 490.03 A: she you never know how she's gonna be ah sometimes she's real nice with everybody and the next time 

490.46 496.25 A: she just wants to fight everybody and mess round like that and just be you know 

496.32 502.81 A: try to be the boss dog and so y- you know it's not a good thing to take her out in public 

498.35 499.43 B: [laughter] 

502.66 508.08 B: they all have their little personalities it's so funny how you know ah 

506.10 507.43 A: oh yeah 

508.19 521.73 B: my parents' labs they're all just you know there's one really sneaky one and then there's one that just has to have everybody's toy when they're n- you know what i mean they they'll walk around collecting all the toys and you know can't have any of the toys that that dog has it's so funny 

520.52 521.56 A: yeah 

522.11 522.98 B: (( so )) 

523.08 524.93 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

523.84 528.14 A: yeah ours are real funny they just totally 

528.91 530.61 A: you know we got one 

530.71 533.98 A: we ha- we got one schnauzer we bought him at like ah 

534.02 540.29 A: pet land and he had been there for like four weeks 

540.57 545.29 A: so he was like three he was maybe he'd been there eight weeks 

545.44 552.50 A: and so he's so needy he's gotta be petted and reassured all the time because he's just a real needy boy 

552.93 558.05 A: and we got another one that you know she's just a character 

558.32 560.44 A: just a total hoot 

560.93 566.23 A: and you know they're so and the schnauzers are so different from the other dogs 

566.52 570.30 A: because the schnauzers love to eat fruit 

570.78 572.00 B: really 

571.55 582.34 A: yeah they'll eat strawberries bananas apples i mean to to them that's just a total treat they will stand there and beg for fruit 

576.13 577.32 B: wow 

583.96 594.89 B: [laughter] [mn] that's so interesting our d- my parents' dogs like they won't eat anything green it's so funny like you know you'll my brother will feed them grapes and they'll roll them around in their mouth and spit them out 

594.83 599.89 B: [laughter] it's just so funny to watch them do it but it's just about just about anything green they won't eat
