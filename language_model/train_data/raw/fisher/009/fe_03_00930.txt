4.55 7.56 A: interesting topic since the president's talking about it right now 

7.15 12.50 B: oh really i i just got a call from my father actually to watch it but i didn't have the t._v. on 

7.81 9.57 A: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

12.15 15.44 A: oh yeah yep he's talking about it right now 

12.66 14.37 B: so yeah 

15.05 16.02 B: really 

15.88 22.76 A: and i kinda think i agree with him i hate disarming him in every way but war is the best i mean that's the least we want to do but 

22.43 30.39 B: [sigh] i know i i we have a couple of friends over there right now that have been stationed and it's really scary i think he should be disarmed but 

25.55 26.33 A: (( right )) 

30.64 35.23 B: the whole war thing and the the chemical warfare really kinda scares me [laughter] 

34.49 44.63 A: i know well it scares everybody and it's but you know one thing he brought up tonight was this has been going on for twelve years [noise] they've been trying to get saddam to disarm for twelve years 

40.57 42.07 B: yeah 

44.83 45.69 B: (( i know )) 

44.93 51.31 A: and he just mentioned that that fourteen fourteen whatever that resolution that he signed actually signed something that said he had none 

51.82 52.64 B: hm 

52.21 57.20 A: and then he came out and said oh but oh yeah well here's some and here's this and 

56.51 59.63 B: yeah and supposedly they destroyed a couple didn't they [noise] 

57.87 58.67 A: (( [noise] )) 

59.46 60.40 A: yeah 

60.41 66.97 A: yeah so he started out by having none to oh by the way here's [laughter] 

65.31 68.95 B: yeah and then they have the ones that could fly further than they were supposed to 

68.56 70.22 A: right right [noise] 

69.68 72.32 B: so at the weren't those the ones that they destroyed 

72.12 75.77 A: i i think so you know i don't stay up top of it that closely 

74.64 77.11 B: i know i don't either i feel bad but it 

76.25 78.84 A: i kn- i know what a great subject huh 

78.22 84.10 B: i know if i watch too much of it though it it just scares me and i think about the people over there and just oh it's horrible 

80.92 82.18 A: exactly 

83.94 87.89 A: well i was commenting too the president is ah looking older 

87.79 88.84 B: he is 

88.20 91.94 A: isn't it amazing how that job ah um ages them 

91.56 93.89 B: i know i mean even right now i just turned it on 

93.62 94.88 A: yeah 

94.10 95.73 B: he looks older than he did 

95.52 96.57 A: yeah 

95.94 99.86 B: when he first came into office [laughter] it's just nuts 

97.89 98.86 A: yeah 

99.47 110.71 A: i know i just mentioned that to my husband he says oh my gosh just think of the weight that he has on his shoulders especially with this whole thing with nine eleven and and i mean that is so heavy on his mind all the time 

103.54 104.36 B: yeah 

110.05 112.63 B: exactly i can't imagine the pressure but 

112.68 113.55 A: no 

114.11 127.40 A: but i know they're saying now that i mean i know all the they listed all the countries that were still against the war part but it i think it's coming down to okay what [laughter] you know it's like the spoiled child thing 

126.88 128.17 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

127.50 134.71 A: he keeps saying okay then you know give up you know give up give up let's do an inspection give 'em up give 'em up and then twelve years later 

134.33 136.06 B: yeah he's still doing it 

135.39 137.43 A: he's still doing it 

136.86 139.01 B: i don't understand how he thinks he could ever win 

138.83 140.20 A: (( [sigh] i don't either )) 

139.08 142.22 B: [laughter] 'cause i mean there's all these nations against him 

141.80 142.85 A: (( i know )) 

142.40 145.38 B: and he's just sitting there by himself with maybe like one other one 

145.43 146.53 A: yeah 

145.84 147.25 B: on his side 

146.71 160.94 A: i know and [noise] the president was also talking about mak- you know we do have ah food supplies ready to go into the iraqi people and i know that what was it the other day he asked he even said saddam should step down wasn't that in the paper or something 

148.81 149.67 B: (( maybe )) 

154.02 155.34 B: mhm 

160.44 164.21 B: (( he wanted him to go into exile or something yeah yeah )) 

161.84 163.64 A: that's right that's what it was 

163.69 164.53 A: yeah 

164.47 168.86 B: that that would be that would be dangerous i would think because you don't know where he is 

166.35 167.40 A: yeah 

168.27 169.75 A: no you don't 

169.02 172.68 B: you what could he be doing he's probably building another army if he does that 

171.87 173.82 A: oh my gosh i know 

172.90 177.00 B: and just think if he comes back i mean it's really sad to say but if we could just kill him 

176.80 181.96 A: i know and it w- like we wh- we didn't do that twelve years ago or whenever it was you know 

177.33 178.65 B: [laughter] 

180.21 181.05 B: yeah 

181.28 181.84 B: (( mm )) 

182.03 188.37 A: and then they s- he said what what all the evidence that shows you know he tortures his own people and 

187.05 189.26 B: i know i know and i wonder 

188.82 189.79 A: (( [mn] )) 

189.84 195.00 B: he probably does i just wonder if they exaggerate it a bit as sort of like propaganda to make us 

192.82 193.84 A: (( i know )) 

194.75 195.94 A: (( right oh )) 

195.17 196.97 B: want to attack him more 

196.57 200.50 A: i know you wonder don't you how much truth is in everything 

197.82 199.09 B: (( mhm )) 

199.92 201.49 B: exactly i mean 

200.75 213.49 A: oh everything oh i just i i'm like you i i try not to listen it a lot it's like watching the news a lot [laughter] [noise] yeah because it's constantly negative stuff 

205.60 206.78 B: mhm 

207.67 210.83 B: yeah i try not to watch news 'cause it's all bad [laughter] 

212.81 214.43 B: yeah 

213.70 219.64 A: constantly and some of the questions these guys are asking tonight why is it or how's it affect the economy well 

219.71 224.21 A: we know how nine eleven affected the economy 'cause we're still it's we're still reeling from it 

224.32 225.26 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

224.37 231.95 A: but war boosts the economy but then i guess it goes right the opposite so then what do you say oh okay that's 

226.71 227.93 B: exactly 

232.27 234.56 A: that's the opposite side but 

234.09 235.45 B: yeah um 

234.84 236.16 A: i don't know 

236.48 237.95 B: it- it's [sigh] 

238.11 243.54 B: ah they've kin- in a way they've put it off for a long time and now everybody's fighting against it 

240.54 241.66 A: right 

243.19 244.44 A: right 

244.20 247.08 B: but ah he's not going to get the u._n. votes anyway 

246.89 261.58 A: well you know that's another thing one of the one of the ah news people brought up and said um if you have this this this country and all this against you in the in the security council he said yeah but when we voted on the resolution the last time [noise] i'm on the phone get off now [noise] um 

261.62 276.11 A: when the the um u._n. resolution that they voted before and they they had a lot of discussion before and they were saying oh no i don't know if we agree when they finally came down to final vote it was fifteen to zero in agreement yeah so his point was okay 

273.23 274.32 B: really 

275.95 277.61 A: when the time came 

277.82 279.60 A: and push came to shove 

279.90 285.26 A: they all were in agreement so he said yes th- the last thing we're looking at is war but you know 

281.14 282.33 B: mhm 

285.65 287.90 A: [mn] i think he's banking on the fact well 

287.94 293.44 A: you know when it really comes down it maybe they see the true color saddam's true colors and all that have back to the 

293.64 298.35 A: fifteen to zero 'cause i thought it was an interesting comment i don't know if anybody knew that 

294.65 295.53 B: yeah 

296.77 299.34 B: i don't know i hadn't heard that i mean 

298.63 300.36 A: nah i hadn't either 

299.97 303.51 B: hopefully because i i'd hate to see him do it with 

303.74 307.55 B: with nobody on our side except i think britain is is backing us 

305.10 306.02 A: right 

307.56 312.31 A: yeah except that they even said whoa was it today they even said somebody on the um 

312.70 314.03 A: not um 

314.06 325.19 A: the usual name you hear over there but ah another high up in the in the u._k. was said something about um [lipsmack] um not going to war right away either it's like what 

324.83 327.27 B: (( yeah i how are they going to put it off yeah )) 

325.39 328.64 A: now they're even say- yeah now they're even saying that 

328.84 329.70 B: and 

329.06 331.35 A: so what's the answer you know 

330.48 341.03 B: it i don't know what they're thinking because even if they did succeed in taking us out and let's say they killed everybody in the united states they're going to go after the next biggest power after that i mean who's next it's 

332.23 332.91 A: (( [cough] )) 

334.45 335.42 A: right 

336.79 337.65 A: right 

338.93 340.00 A: right 

340.45 342.01 A: and then they'd be weak 

341.51 342.65 B: mhm 

342.03 343.59 A: then they'd be weakened 

343.26 344.40 B: exactly 

343.76 347.74 A: they wouldn't have anybody then they [cough] it's almost like world war two 

347.50 348.62 B: mhm 

348.00 350.63 A: we got involved when we weren't going to 

350.20 351.28 B: mhm 

350.67 354.48 A: because it hit us well that's the same thing that's going to it would happen 

354.53 362.32 A: if saddam started doing something then all of a sudden people were saying no no no then all of a s- and everybody would jump in 'cause oh wait a minute it does involve us 

361.67 363.87 B: yeah yeah suddenly they're threatened so [laughter] 

363.10 366.55 A: exactly exactly sort of like nine eleven did to us 

366.09 367.14 B: yeah 

366.58 369.90 A: we finally realized that it can touch us 

369.37 372.10 B: yeah 'cause we'd watched it happen to everybody else 

371.47 372.43 A: right 

372.16 373.61 B: and then all of a sudden oh 

373.68 375.34 A: oh oh [laughter] 

374.43 375.61 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

375.77 384.08 A: wow but i you know i don't know what more can what c- more can the u._n. council do as far as getting him to disarm i don't under- i don't know 

384.30 391.97 A: what i you know another thing i don't understand is how do they know all this is when they when they come back and say well we don't really think he's disclosing everything 

392.04 392.81 B: (( mhm )) 

392.09 395.59 A: when the- what what are they walking around and are they 

395.84 402.20 A: getting blueprints of places and are they i i guess that that's one thing i really haven't paid enough attention to 

401.88 411.27 B: yeah i mean it's just got to be intelligence it h- has to be people in there because they have 'em here we've always had spies here they've been found here and there but 

404.54 406.04 A: it must be huh 

408.88 410.66 A: right right 

411.03 419.09 A: well yeah but i mean he's got this u._n. council the- there in his country and he's supposed to be disclosing stuff well then where do you start 

411.70 412.92 B: (( he's gotta have 'em )) 

418.70 419.80 B: yeah 

419.21 424.18 A: (( [laughter] how do i know he's not how do i know he's not not lying to me )) 

419.87 420.69 B: i know 

423.79 424.84 B: yeah 

424.25 434.81 A: how do i know he's disclosing anything i mean like you said it's gotta be like maybe secur- pictures maybe photographs taken from radar i don't you know all that stuff that we supposedly have the technology 

425.90 426.50 B: (( mm )) 

429.54 430.48 B: mhm 

434.37 435.86 B: yeah 

435.32 437.03 A: i mean i g- i'm assuming 

437.01 438.02 B: it's it's 

437.92 439.29 A: [laughter] 

438.08 441.33 B: gotta be i mean it and then again they they know of 

441.42 443.56 B: where he's hiding this and that 

442.96 443.97 A: right 

444.07 450.34 B: ah and then they say it on the news that they know where the scud is they should just keep it to themselves and take care of it and 

447.40 448.68 A: (( right and )) 

449.73 457.05 A: right ex- that's what i was wondering is why don't they just go in and then they do find something and the- they what was that one time they just found all those empty shells 

457.24 460.22 A: it was a shell for a for bombs or something 

458.00 459.45 B: yeah 

459.59 464.05 B: yeah and they were thinking that maybe he was getting ready to arm them with some kind of chemical 

463.66 465.69 A: right right 

464.18 466.22 B: weapon and shoot 'em over here 

465.91 467.89 A: oh gosh 

467.56 472.97 B: i mean that's a scary thing even here in maine they've started doing the the smallpox vaccine 

472.62 474.57 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

473.55 477.02 B: and that's kinda creepy [laughter] 

476.01 485.19 A: well what's yeah what was the story on that i heard the other day that um [lipsmack] some of nurses or something were having reactions to it and the president put a fund in place 

482.32 483.15 B: yeah 

485.31 489.82 A: a small to give um a little amount of money for death or 

489.44 490.38 B: mhm 

489.84 496.70 A: anything else caused by the smallpox for i guess government people in government have to take it that's what it was right 

491.83 492.75 B: yeah they were 

494.86 495.50 B: yeah 

495.78 498.65 B: yeah i think so because they make military men 

498.34 508.33 A: yeah yeah and i think government employees have to because they might handle mail i don't know if it's mail but any of that kind of stuff that i guess people out there are people getting sick from it 

499.30 500.77 B: (( and anthrax vaccine )) 

505.14 506.22 B: mhm 

507.83 511.33 B: yeah i've heard that they they had a high reaction rate to it 

511.27 512.27 A: ooh 

511.75 520.00 B: and they i mean a lot of people probably already have it though because they didn't stop it till the the like mid seventies didn't stop giving it so 

517.86 519.32 A: right right 

519.86 524.65 A: oh so the- so they're they're stepping up in maine and more people are getting it 

523.96 531.36 B: yeah they i've heard on the news um that actually i don't know probably a couple of hospitals have started it and people are volunteering 

531.46 532.65 A: wow 

532.25 535.39 B: but i mean [sigh] yeah 

534.50 541.49 A: yeah 'cause i knew they were doing they were targeting ah all the government employees first right right and then they didn't want to run out 

538.64 539.79 B: (( yeah )) 

541.10 542.29 B: yeah 

541.64 547.31 A: 'cause they had to ha- had to cover everybody like that so now they're starting the population huh 

547.24 548.76 B: (( yeah yeah i th- )) 

547.87 550.90 A: and that only lasts a certain length of time 

550.76 554.57 B: i don't know i thought it was forever like uh like they have the chickenpox vaccine now 

554.24 558.37 A: well but then why are us who are young enough to get the vaccine 

558.63 564.80 A: having to have another one though that's what i don't sort of understand this i don't there can't be it can't last must not last forever 

561.20 562.56 B: yeah 

564.48 568.51 B: yeah maybe not i don't know or new strains and stuff maybe 

567.05 577.08 A: yeah that too but gosh [mn] this whole thing is just well i don't think anybody there again going back to the nine eleven and its and saddam hu- hussein i don't think they 

577.33 580.93 A: took saddam hussein serious until the nine eleven thing happened 

580.31 584.05 B: no i don't think they did they just thought he was in the the woodwork again 

583.69 584.92 A: right 

584.25 587.93 B: and i mean it's hard to tell what he's got over there 

585.58 586.84 A: oh good he's 

587.33 594.15 A: yeah oh good he's just staying in his own country he's just doing his own thing there oh right he's probably helped financing this and 

591.15 592.16 B: mhm 

593.79 594.65 B: yeah 

594.84 596.94 A: oh man [sigh] 

596.10 599.89 B: yeah like who he's got backing him i'm sure there's plenty of crazy people giving him money and
