14.08 15.06 B: mhm 

14.31 25.02 A: and it made me feel a little bit more comfortable because it was talking about how the reality of anything doing as much damage as the media is portraying is pretty slim 

23.17 24.61 B: [laughter] 

25.25 32.28 A: so that made me feel better and as far as like subway attacks that have happened in the past most of the people 

32.33 36.55 A: didn't die there's so many ways to protect yourself 

35.96 37.23 B: mhm 

37.23 40.44 A: but it still scares me a whole lot [laughter] 

39.93 43.88 B: yeah actually out of all of them that scares me the most i'm

68.91 73.74 B: so this is close to home but that's one of the things that really scares me and i think that's because it's 

73.76 77.52 B: insidious you know you know it's not something you can really see 

75.22 76.50 A: yeah 

77.29 78.38 A: right 

78.11 81.12 B: not that you could stop a bullet or a bomb but

134.96 137.12 A: (( yeah so )) 

137.90 141.42 A: have you heard any new news updates or anything 

140.99 149.37 B: actually i was just watching the news and they were just going back and forth about the security council and it's very frustrating 

148.90 150.21 A: yeah 

149.51 152.54 B: i don't know if are you pro war or 

151.93 157.34 A: i i'm definitely not pro war but i know we have to protect ourselves 

154.55 155.75 B: mhm 

157.09 158.26 B: yeah 

157.53 171.48 A: whatever we it's kind of hard i mean i'd much rather us not have to do that especially you know right now at any time but it's kind of like if we don't do anything i don't know what's going to happen either 

166.03 167.29 B: mhm 

170.83 172.76 B: yeah i mean 

172.82 177.99 B: part of my background is i've worked in law enforcement i'm a therapist 

177.18 178.66 A: oh wow 

178.09 189.78 B: so there's a lot of criminal thinking involved here you know and i also know a lot of um federal people who deal with terrorism and stuff 

182.51 183.59 A: right 

189.38 190.38 A: uhuh 

190.01 193.20 B: so you put the two together and you have to act 

192.85 194.18 A: yeah 

193.30 196.11 B: that's how i feel i know i'm you know 

196.20 198.28 B: totally to one side 

197.68 203.22 A: yeah it's horrifying it's funny because i was a flight attendant for eight and a half years 

198.51 199.72 B: but 

202.63 205.45 B: oh my god [laughter] 

203.24 214.67 A: so we're both like in the same like i'm the airplane aspect that's so funny yeah and that in itself i mean i would have i actually was on maternity leave um planning on quitting when 

206.90 208.34 B: yeah 

214.87 227.61 A: september eleven happened i was supposed to my daughter was born december of two thousand and my maternity leave goes up december of two thousand and one and i if she had hadn't been born and i wasn't going to stay home with her i would have quit 

216.34 217.33 B: uhuh 

227.63 228.39 B: (( oh )) 

227.86 233.55 A: because flying isn't what it used to be and that's just too close to home 

230.58 231.63 B: yeah 

233.19 238.02 B: oh this it's amazing [laughter] who did you fly for 

235.19 236.83 A: yeah 

237.46 238.73 A: continental 

238.29 239.66 B: mhm 

239.03 246.88 A: so my husband's a pilot too so for me i absolutely really had to quit 'cause somebody had to stay home and he's still flying 

244.78 245.79 B: (( aha )) 

246.53 249.68 B: so he's still flying how does he feel about all that 

248.49 260.72 A: he well i mean he there's been so many crazy things that happen i've had situations even where i had a passenger with a loaded gun on one of my flights and so weird things do happen 

257.39 258.37 B: (( uhuh )) 

260.17 261.12 B: uhuh 

260.60 268.98 A: but i mean the security it's like now with all the talk about possibly carrying weapons he's a co captain 

268.76 269.74 B: okay 

269.25 281.22 A: so you know the possibility of some of those guys carrying guns and the cockpit doors are so sealed now and but i mean it's his job and he's got to do it 

280.63 285.67 B: mhm you're you're very close to it too then amazing 

284.07 287.98 A: yeah yeah i know isn't that funny 

287.36 291.58 B: yeah to get two people who you know have 

288.04 289.13 A: wow 

290.79 293.33 A: both sides of yeah 

292.36 294.69 B: yeah just experiencing it 

293.43 297.62 A: the whole thing right of being able to relate to those people you know 

296.99 301.11 B: mhm well tell him you know i feel for him and um 

301.00 303.02 A: thanks yeah 

301.53 306.21 B: you know i don't know what to say you don't say good luck to somebody like that 

305.15 317.33 A: no but i mean but then i think of all the people who are fire fighters who are you know nats they have to be in the scariest place because i mean as an airline pilot like me and my husband have to deal with it but 

317.12 326.99 A: that's only one aspect of what they can do i mean police officers and fire fighters have i mean no matter what they do they have to be on the scene 

320.03 321.14 B: mhm 

326.66 330.48 B: yeah unfortunately a lot of the guys who were in that we knew 

330.20 331.72 A: oh wow 

330.95 339.69 B: because we had to deal with them you know living in that area but that was their job and they would have given you know their left leg for it so 

333.92 335.26 A: yeah 

338.62 340.29 A: oh wow 

339.90 341.09 B: people 

341.17 342.99 B: do what they love doing 

342.24 352.78 A: exactly and yeah and if i mean thank goodness for those people because what would this world be like if there weren't people dedicated and we'd be really in big trouble 

349.96 351.21 B: mhm 

352.27 355.71 B: yeah do you have c._m._r._t. teams in ohio 

355.57 356.72 A: say that again 

356.39 361.38 B: c._m._r._t. teams they're community emergency response teams that 

357.64 359.11 A: no i haven't 

360.73 362.99 A: i haven't heard of that i know 

362.08 363.17 B: really 

363.30 369.33 A: they're talking about you know different plans but i haven't heard of anything specific like that 

365.98 366.92 B: mhm 

369.20 376.21 B: because that they started them here it's just a way for the community to get involved too and my husband and i did that 

372.06 373.17 A: oh 

375.61 378.51 A: oh that's great i should look into that 

377.91 379.54 B: it helps you like 

379.85 388.12 B: well you're in you know you're right on the plane and stuff anyway so you guys are right in the middle of it but for people who have like no sense of control 

383.21 384.50 A: yeah 

385.50 386.62 A: yeah 

387.77 388.91 A: right 

388.47 390.89 B: it helps people have a sense of control 

390.47 394.68 A: yeah just the community i think it helps to talk with other people 

394.17 395.24 B: mhm 

394.93 396.20 A: yeah 

395.59 396.80 B: definitely 

396.12 402.66 A: because fear i mean it really it's like a fog has blit every time they talk about on the news something 

402.52 414.15 A: coming close to home and when they were we were on high alert and everybody is buying duct tape and vialed water i mean it really you need to kinda talk to people because otherwise it's 

414.23 415.84 A: the stress levels 

415.42 416.92 B: mhm 

416.40 423.68 A: and i'm thinking i'm nervous enough about going through labor again in like with the hospitals who knows what they can do there 

423.48 424.60 B: mhm 

423.98 428.19 A: like there's just so many things that you could be afraid of day to day 

428.05 434.40 B: that's true but at least at the hospital you have security and stuff like that and i'm sure they'd beef that up 

431.47 432.51 A: right 

433.79 437.31 A: and if it's going to happen i mean it's like you think about 

436.15 438.17 B: yeah that's the other side of it 

437.51 447.04 A: yeah there's you're powerless over it so why you know worry about it because there's absolutely nothing you can do you can take every precaution but 

438.20 439.75 B: mhm 

442.55 443.63 B: mhm 

446.57 447.41 B: right 

447.12 454.23 A: you know when you think about all the people in the world trade centre i mean they're all angels they didn't they had no idea either 

454.21 462.52 B: that's exactly how i think of them i mean we know a few of them but nobody actually family or anything family did work down there 

457.45 458.70 A: wow 

461.93 463.25 A: wow 

462.55 467.87 B: but they didn't you know it's just like um colleagues of my husband's sisters 

467.65 468.68 A: oh 

467.94 470.52 B: dying classmates and stuff like 

469.97 471.85 A: i just can't imagine 

471.75 483.97 B: that i can't imagine that i did go down there i had to yeah i had to go to new york for a funeral so i made i dragged my mother along down there and just stood there with our mouths open 

474.55 476.93 A: you did oh 

480.51 482.10 A: (( wow )) 

483.54 485.35 A: (( yeah i bet )) 

485.38 486.49 B: (( you know )) 

486.10 492.27 A: i can't my husband flew over it and that was hard enough to be but i mean to be right there ugh 

489.00 490.25 B: yeah 

491.63 493.05 B: yeah 

493.47 497.57 A: yeah that's just something i don't think anybody is ever going to get over 

497.13 498.24 B: mhm 

497.93 509.81 A: it's so scary and you wonder what would make what goes through those people's minds i mean i know that they're from a whole other world but i can't imagine a human being 

503.68 505.69 B: [laughter] 

510.11 511.89 A: isn't that weird 

511.28 516.81 B: thinking you mean to hurt all those people yeah that's the criminal thinking again 

512.75 514.68 A: (( right yes )) 

516.02 528.91 A: it's so frightening that people think that way well and i'm real into like i watch law and order every week and all those shows and now boomtown and i'm thinking how do people how what makes a person like that 

521.00 522.70 B: (( [laughter] )) 

529.04 531.38 B: it's a whole it's a 

531.35 533.62 A: chemicals and 

532.95 537.39 B: yeah it's actually a form of addictive behaviour but um 

537.01 537.80 A: (( ugh )) 

537.47 540.80 B: it's hard to explain but it is a whole other way of thinking 

540.37 541.66 A: yeah 

541.16 547.34 B: it's like i kept saying to someone you know they put all the effort we put into leading our daily lives into getting over 

548.00 551.56 B: on people you know that term to get over on people 

548.98 550.20 A: yeah 

551.28 552.36 A: uhuh 

552.20 555.84 B: so i guess bin laden thinks he got over on the u._s. 

555.38 556.64 A: right 

556.03 558.34 B: or something i don't know 

557.20 559.49 A: and that's so sad 

559.16 560.22 B: yeah 

560.25 563.74 A: yeah it's going to be interesting in the next year what happens 

563.20 564.26 B: mhm 

564.25 567.46 A: hopefully next year at this time everything will be peaceful 

567.24 571.54 B: yeah and your daughter will be born right or your i said daughter like or 

569.25 570.59 A: yeah 

571.20 572.34 A: it is

572.47 575.31 A: yeah i have another daughter coming so 

574.95 575.97 B: okay 

575.65 577.15 A: definitely my 

577.22 585.32 A: two year old kept saying that it was going to be a sister and we had a i actually had to have a few ultrasounds so they confirmed it but it's funny how she just knew 

585.06 585.90 B: (( ha )) 

585.71 586.98 A: yeah 

586.29 587.83 B: that's interesting 

587.33 588.82 A: it's exciting 

588.35 591.84 B: yeah so you think you you'll go back to flying or 

591.03 599.89 A: i don't think so sometimes my husband and i talk about it like when the kids are grown up and you know he's flying and i can be a flight attendant i i
