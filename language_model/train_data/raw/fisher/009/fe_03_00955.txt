242.44 242.99 A: (( )) 

245.61 246.66 B: a lot of people told me that 

245.72 246.83 A: hm mhm

271.27 271.83 A: yeah 

273.12 274.38 B: the people we saw as 

274.22 274.90 A: hm mhm 

275.79 278.25 B: were the japanese because they were the ones who ultimately 

278.37 279.38 B: you know touched us 

279.94 284.01 B: who know ultimately you know got the pearl harbor thing so they were these like closest to us 

280.31 281.29 A: right

345.57 346.48 A: no 

346.13 353.69 B: is it's own course of action and look at like afghanistan i mean the whole reason it got to the point it was is because of its changing hands with
