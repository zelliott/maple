6.25 7.50 B: hi nathan 

7.33 8.27 A: hi 

8.21 12.72 B: this is a loaded ah topic isn't it [laughter] 

10.33 11.72 A: [laughter] 

11.87 13.07 A: yeah 

15.15 18.31 B: i was just watching um the news ah 

18.39 22.72 B: tonight or the oh i guess it was oprah i watched ah 

22.76 26.36 B: (( about ah iraq and saddam hussein )) 

26.73 28.04 B: so ah 

28.19 29.44 B: what is your 

29.50 31.53 B: take on all that's going on 

31.51 33.32 A: well i'm 

33.68 36.64 A: still a little undecided on it um 

36.78 47.10 A: [mn] i kind of i mean i do definitely have the i don't know i feel like the u._s. does have a special interest in going over there and making sure that we're not in danger 

47.19 50.41 A: the whole idea of the war though doesn't really appeal to me 

50.40 52.12 B: ah i have to agree 

52.51 55.92 B: i have to agree but i think that the man needs to be taken 

56.15 58.21 B: taken out ah 

59.77 63.04 B: but ah it would be nice if it could be done without a war 

63.11 64.04 A: right 

64.27 65.22 B: um 

64.47 65.32 A: i 

65.88 67.15 B: (( he ah )) 

67.23 73.17 B: you know like he's a a dictator where there's a lot of people and if they do anything wrong they get killed so 

73.45 74.64 A: (( [noise] right )) 

73.51 77.18 B: there's no- they can't mount much of a of a ah [noise] 

77.64 79.25 B: protest or 

80.22 83.43 B: ah h- [mn] he's got such control of them 

84.24 91.36 B: so so what do you do you know like i i really don't think that i really don't think that iraq is a threat 

91.43 93.63 B: and i think using that ah 

94.84 98.14 B: the [noise] world trade center and osama 

98.14 111.22 B: is probably not ah i mean that's just ah a good excuse i guess to go back in and finish what should have been finished in the first place [noise] [noise] [noise] 

108.72 109.82 A: yeah 

110.69 111.83 A: it's uh 

112.34 116.32 A: i c- i agree with that um i do see some of the threat as 

116.54 130.46 A: i don't know for me not necessarily that iraq intends to attack the united states because that was i mean the retribution that he would receive for that ah would just be you know more than he would be wanti- i think more than he would want to take on 

130.69 135.93 A: but er the threat that i see there is if he is you know developing the the weapons of mass destruction 

136.15 136.98 A: (( um )) 

137.11 148.79 A: ah the ah possible sale t- of those to terrorist factions whether he is necessarily involved in okay and i mean i really don't have an opinion on that haven't seen any evidence to show necessarily that he is or not but 

148.85 149.89 A: um 

150.10 157.34 A: i per- i personally don't think that he would have any qualms about selling those to terrorist groups 

157.50 159.47 A: who would be willing to use those 

157.54 158.71 B: (( [noise] oh for sure )) 

158.75 162.24 B: for sure not yeah tha- that's that's true 

162.81 169.76 B: that's true but it just seems like there could be a better way of of accomplishing what he wants to accomplish 

165.99 167.17 A: yeah 

169.67 170.83 A: i've actually been 

171.17 172.05 B: (( you know )) 

172.80 173.94 A: are you there 

173.86 178.76 B: yeah i'm here i'm i'm just moving [laughter] i'm moving i've got a a hand held phone 

174.71 176.07 A: kinda breaking up 

178.44 179.37 A: okay 

178.94 186.78 B: and i'm moving around i have i was over in another building when the call came and i had to run over and get my p._i._n. number 

185.33 186.39 A: [laughter] 

187.24 188.14 A: right 

187.71 190.05 B: yeah so ah 

191.11 201.38 B: i there was somebody else that was i i don't know that a lot of people i- i- it bothers me that a lot of christian people are you know out for for blood 

201.23 202.53 A: right 

202.02 205.80 B: and um i just don't see that as uh 

206.50 207.52 B: um 

207.95 209.88 B: really the way it should be 

209.48 210.68 A: yeah 

210.25 212.14 B: but um oh 

211.45 219.70 A: like i don't know i see part of it as being i mean we hear about the things that he does and again we don't have a whole lot at least i haven't seen a lot of evidence just kind of rumors about 

219.71 226.35 A: you know the mass graves and the weapons testing that he does over there biological weapons testing and things on you know on his own people 

226.24 227.24 B: right 

226.64 233.11 A: and i don't really know you know how much of that is true and how much of that is just sensationalism um 

233.27 238.97 A: but if if part of that is true then i do kind of see a i mean i like 

239.76 249.97 A: a need moral need and ethical need um i don't know if i want to say it's a christian need because ah christianity tends to be much more passive than than anything 

249.76 263.78 B: yeah what christians have you been talking to [laughter] [laughter] yeah [laughter] yeah well i mean you know like i get a lot of them quoting from the bible that ah you know that that's the thing to do 

252.23 255.24 A: i guess the ideal maybe that's what i'm thinking 

255.30 257.10 A: christ himself was 

257.25 258.09 A: (( ah )) 

263.68 264.72 A: right 

264.09 266.90 B: to go over there and wipe him out but ah 

266.53 270.09 A: it's funny now that i mention that i think about the the best passive 

270.10 272.87 A: you know ideal that i've ever seen was gandhi 

272.71 273.74 B: mhm 

273.35 276.63 A: who you know hindu rather than christian maybe it's 

276.72 278.42 A: [laughter] anyway 

278.17 280.28 B: yeah well bas uh yeah 

280.75 289.77 A: my ah my personal opinion i was thinking about this the other like earlier this week you know like what would be a better way than to of going in there rather than just starting a war 

280.90 281.79 B: (( the )) 

289.80 290.89 A: and um 

290.99 291.80 A: my 

292.18 296.11 A: feelings on it were that the only really way if we could reach osama or ah 

296.53 298.22 A: saddam hussein 

298.49 299.49 A: (( ah )) 

299.58 310.60 A: was just to you know stop importing oil which would create i mean a a need for in complete unity within the united states to stop using oil to the extent that we have been 

310.79 320.00 A: ah you know enough to get by with the exports we can get from venezuela or some of the other arab countries that we don't feel so hostile towards 

320.56 332.56 B: well my thing is is why not ah develop alternative ah other alternative powers and and uh and and also or if um [lipsmack] i didn't mean power but ah 

326.35 328.00 A: oh absolutely 

332.62 334.88 B: s- you know sources for 

334.93 335.95 B: um 

336.91 340.80 B: (( electricity like the [cough] there's um )) 

338.13 339.02 A: yeah 

341.07 345.50 B: ah i've i've seen things on the um the internet ah 

345.56 347.50 B: that um 

347.77 350.64 B: ah i don't know if you ever heard of ah 

350.65 354.34 B: nikolai ah nik- nikola tesa- tesla 

354.71 356.22 A: ah no i don't think so 

355.87 368.07 B: no well he he was um he was kind of an eccentric uh inventor who um ah thought of i i guess he was the inventor of d._c. 

368.13 369.16 B: power 

368.23 369.12 A: okay 

369.41 381.34 B: and he felt that uh direct current was better than um alternating current and edison had a bigger ah following i think it was edison 

381.55 387.95 B: and so y- and had you know people of uh with money and power behind him 

387.98 390.82 B: so that was the one that was developed 

390.68 391.41 A: (( mm )) 

391.17 392.34 B: and 

392.71 395.69 B: [cough] so uh and you know to me um 

396.91 400.07 B: [mn] i just i look at it and i think that ah 

400.22 402.97 B: the united states needs to 

403.10 412.36 B: ah you know to maybe pull back like th- her- here's another scenario that's very scary about all of this is here are all of these troops over 

412.30 417.95 B: [mn] in the gulf ready to to go ah and you know take out hussein 

417.85 429.95 B: and yet um you know there's this problem with korea and then there's the problem in the philippines plus all of the other things that the united states has got their nose stuck into 

424.95 425.85 A: right 

430.05 434.83 B: and um ah you know is there enough to 

434.92 435.97 B: um 

436.37 449.15 B: to go around you know are there enough troops is there enough manpower and then and then there's uh the uh obligation to um support this country if if they 

438.38 439.22 A: right 

449.19 453.13 B: ah you know if if bush acts unilaterally 

453.51 455.74 B: (( [cough] so )) 

456.91 458.42 B: that's um 

458.75 466.54 B: you know is is this the the way to to bankrupt the u._s. and to break it is by spreading you know because it's like the old saying 

466.58 469.27 B: um let's see now what is that 

469.45 470.16 B: ah 

470.59 471.60 B: [mn] 

471.90 475.30 B: toge- oh let's see divided no what is that one 

475.65 476.74 A: (( i don't know )) 

476.37 478.11 B: you never heard that quote 

477.79 481.03 A: something about spreading yourself too thin is that 

479.46 482.81 B: well yeah th- that part but there's the one ah 

483.22 485.33 B: um about ah 

485.64 488.53 B: together we stand divided we fall 

488.29 489.21 A: okay 

488.97 490.02 B: yeah 

490.15 491.14 B: so 

491.73 498.11 B: [noise] and then and that i mean that you can still be divided in a common interest but if you're i mean to um 

498.24 505.09 B: together in a common interest but if you're spread out too thin then that's as bad as not not agreeing 

505.49 508.87 B: so i kinda wonder about that too [cough] 

508.40 509.67 A: mhm 

510.87 512.50 B: i don't know um 

513.04 518.24 B: it's ah did you watch that um interview that dan rather did with him 

517.91 521.64 A: no i i didn't i didn't hear about it until after it was over [laughter] 

520.80 526.04 B: yeah well th- i didn't get to see the interview i just saw today um 

526.18 527.75 B: (( what ah )) 

527.97 533.39 B: on oprah they talked to dan rather and he was talking about how ah 

534.23 539.47 B: he figures he won the the the war in ninety because he 

539.51 540.65 B: um 

541.56 544.36 B: because h- he's still alive 

545.12 547.36 A: oh yeah i guess it depends on what your 

547.67 550.84 A: what your goals are at the end of that 

549.93 553.00 B: yeah so he figures that he's going to 

553.10 554.24 B: um 

554.40 559.71 B: that no matter what happens he's still going to be ah standing when it's all said and done 

559.95 560.67 A: mm 

560.45 565.76 B: but how i what i what boggles my mind is how can somebody do th- you know 

566.22 569.64 B: [mn] do the um things that he's done 

570.16 575.53 B: perpetrate the atrocities that he has upon the people on his his own people 

575.61 577.10 B: and um 

577.71 580.21 B: that he's supposed to be protecting 

580.74 586.88 B: a- how c- how can he ah you know like uh th- that kind of mentality is just 

586.90 588.46 B: oh i can't 

588.98 590.92 B: i c- it's hard for me to fathom 

590.75 591.93 A: right 

592.15 594.23 B: because it's just um [mn] 

596.11 597.00 B: just 

597.18 598.94 B: like for why 

599.07 599.90 B: i i like
