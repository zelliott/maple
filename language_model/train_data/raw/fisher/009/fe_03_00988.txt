3.35 4.89 B: hi kristy 

4.33 6.14 A: i'm in louisiana 

5.56 9.84 B: hi kristy and i'm sylvia and i'm in california in sacramento 

9.59 11.15 A: oh okay 

11.80 18.29 A: we're supposed to talk about bioterrorism [laughter] not a subject i'm very familiar with 

13.20 16.23 B: (( bioterrorism [laughter] )) 

17.83 19.51 B: right 

18.32 19.40 A: [laughter] 

19.57 21.82 A: anyway it is pretty scary 

21.70 26.58 B: you know it is and it's something that i wish that we hadn't become this familiar with 

26.26 28.24 A: yeah me too um 

28.40 39.69 A: i remember during the um anthrax scare i opened all of our company mail and we were told you know if you don't want to open it don't you know just give it to the person it's addressed to and let them decide 

35.29 37.01 B: really 

38.62 42.78 B: and let them deal with it oh my goodness yeah it's very scary 

42.89 46.09 B: and gosh what can we do to [sigh] 

46.20 48.70 B: what can our country do to 

48.82 52.26 B: avoid a bioterrorist attack is that what they were saying 

51.87 60.01 A: yeah i think so and you know as far as i'm concerned i think they're on the right track trying to find the you know the weapons track them down 

58.71 60.41 B: continue to look 

60.22 62.45 A: is a good way to start 

60.56 64.90 B: you know hope that they can get saddam hussein to 

64.27 65.30 A: right 

65.48 66.78 B: disarm 

66.86 67.95 A: right 

67.79 71.81 B: i don't know it doesn't look like he's making much of an effort 

71.69 73.62 A: no it really doesn't so 

74.61 79.96 B: so i don't know i'm in favor of going to war if that's what it's going to have to see 

79.15 91.94 A: me too you know a lot of my friends are very anti war and they have tried to convince me you know that saddam has done nothing to us but i mean you know and that we shouldn't have a war because he hasn't done anything to us 

92.57 93.89 A: but i don't 

92.60 93.67 B: so you 

93.81 100.22 B: know i have to say and of course i'm being in california there's [mn] many many people against the war 

94.01 94.59 A: (( [mn] )) 

99.74 101.51 A: right yeah 

100.97 104.20 B: and i'm sure that's all over the country but 

104.40 109.14 B: i mean what do they think you know are we going to wait until he attacks us 

108.47 117.80 A: right it's kind of too late once he has done something but i mean according to their perspective then war's only justified i guess after somebody has attacked us 

110.45 112.01 B: i think so 

117.66 118.60 B: (( mm )) 

119.09 125.31 B: i see and i just and i feel like and i can understand that way of thinking but i do feel like um 

126.08 128.13 B: you know if we don't he's going to 

128.18 131.31 A: yeah and i watch c._n._n. a lot and 

131.43 137.99 A: you know he's very supportive of terrorism so i mean there's no proof i guess that he would give weapons to 

138.09 143.05 A: um al qaeda but [mn] what's to prevent him from doing that i mean 

142.37 143.76 B: exactly 

143.24 147.57 A: he's anti america and um pro terrorism so 

146.10 150.57 B: it's amazing how these people are so anti american 

150.14 151.43 A: i know 

151.27 154.83 B: you know i really wasn't aware of that before nine eleven 

154.45 155.89 A: yeah 

155.83 157.16 B: but um 

157.23 166.37 B: it is very scary and i don't know i think that we are on the right track i i'm i'm hopeful that they will find something and be able to really act on it 

166.06 175.26 A: yeah yeah i'm hoping that war can be avoided too but i think there has to be the threat of war or he'll just do whatever he pleases you know i mean 

173.86 174.67 B: yeah 

174.76 176.71 B: i think that's very true 

176.22 177.92 A: and then you know my 

178.01 185.01 A: bad the thing too is that we're kind of ignoring north korea not that they're a bio bioterrorism but 

185.05 192.16 A: you know they're out there firing missiles and stuff and we're just pretty much ignoring that so 

192.14 197.76 B: you know i yes that's very true and you kind of wonder wha you know that's a loose cannon right there 

193.43 194.83 A: [laughter] 

195.90 205.37 A: yeah what's going on with that i mean we're so concentrated on saddam hussein that we're just letting north korea do whatever it wants 

204.19 206.27 B: certainly do what they want to do 

205.99 212.66 A: right i think hoping that somebody else will make them stop and that [laughter] we don't have to get involved [laughter] 

207.03 208.41 B: (( um [sigh] )) 

209.67 210.55 B: (( [sigh] )) 

212.43 225.77 B: yeah but you know you know [mn] i was listening to the radio just a few minutes ago on the way home and [sigh] they were saying that you know [sigh] the perception out there now is america at one time was 

225.59 229.16 B: definitely a war i mean a world leader 

228.82 229.91 A: mhm 

229.28 234.60 B: and now the perception is that they're is that we're just kind of war hungry 

234.30 235.50 A: yeah 

234.88 238.11 B: and that's so sad to me because ah 

238.20 243.86 B: i think that's so far from the truth it's more just protecting 

241.03 242.83 A: yeah i think so too 

244.01 248.58 B: us protecting americans and our land and our interests 

248.31 250.32 A: yeah and i think we have to 

251.00 253.55 B: (( we don't [laughter] who's going to )) 

253.99 258.83 B: i mean that was pretty obvious with nine eleven who would have ever thought 

256.86 271.34 A: oh i know of yeah who would have thought i didn't even know about that until about four o'clock in the afternoon when the kids came home from school i felt like such an idiot i had been out and around and everybody was real jumpy that day but nobody said anything 

264.18 265.68 B: oh my goodness 

268.65 269.96 B: [laughter] 

270.09 272.34 B: but nobody said anything 

271.43 287.21 A: no and i hadn't put the t._v. on i had been out in the morning and then i came home and cleaned house and my next door neighbour was a cop and he had slept all day he had worked the night shift and slept all day and we were the last two on earth to know anything [laughter] the kids came home screaming we're at war and we were going 

275.66 276.50 B: mhm 

283.11 284.87 B: oh how funny 

286.52 287.55 B: (( [mn] )) 

287.01 288.58 A: yes sure we are 

288.02 289.62 B: (( you're like what )) 

289.27 297.48 A: put the t._v. on and he came over and said ma'am do you know what's going on you know so i'll look at c._n._n. and find out you know 

289.99 291.05 B: yeah 

293.16 295.41 B: oh my goodness 

297.17 305.05 B: my daughter i had just i do consulting work and i had just finished a contract and [mn] decided to take a week off 

305.04 314.51 B: and i was sleeping in you know trying to relax and my daughter called at you know gosh seven i don't early in the morning and 

315.59 316.68 B: (( said )) 

317.79 321.13 B: you know mum turn on the get up get up turn on the t._v. 

321.34 327.94 B: and um she said i'm on my way over so she dropped the kids at school and came over and we were just glued to uh 

328.31 333.68 B: to the t._v. the rest of the day but you know that was the beginning of a whole new world for us 

329.99 330.99 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

333.02 338.57 A: yeah it was i remember that right after when everybody was so paranoid about everything and then um 

338.70 346.17 A: right after that the president was a hundred i mean we live in a little i'm in west monroe i'm in north louisiana nobody ever heard of it you know 

345.82 346.88 B: yeah 

346.26 356.76 A: so what do we have to worry about terrorism but the president was in shreveport which is less than a hundred miles from here and we were like please go home [laughter] we don't want you 

352.44 354.13 B: oh my goodness 

356.49 359.38 B: no [laughter] that's right 

358.09 369.50 A: not right now [laughter] but that was kind of making everyone paranoid that the president was a hundred miles away because otherwise al qaeda don't know who we are [laughter] you know he'd never find us so 

359.51 360.99 B: [laughter] 

363.62 365.58 B: because that's right [laughter] 

367.30 368.70 B: [laughter] 

369.46 376.01 B: [laughter] and that's kind of i keep thinking well we i'm in sacramento and it's okay it's not san francisco or l._a. 

371.39 372.36 A: [laughter] 

375.08 376.67 A: yeah 

376.37 387.89 B: but it is the state capital [sigh] and right so you just you know what who knows though who knows what's going in on in their minds 

378.73 382.70 A: yeah we don't even have a world trade centre [laughter] 

385.42 386.44 A: yeah 

387.43 388.51 A: right 

388.26 394.44 B: and that's exactly what's so scary i just think that you know all this increased um 

394.92 402.76 B: you know security and you know heightened awareness is definitely what we have to do we have to continue that 

402.86 412.71 B: um i don't know i actually have heard of a couple of instances where reports were made that weren't taken seriously right after nine eleven 

412.35 413.25 A: (( ahah mhm )) 

413.29 421.04 B: my daughter was i guess somebody that works with her husband or i don't know something somebody that they knew maybe through one of the kids 

421.64 426.01 B: said that there was a mcdonalds here in town that if the kids go to 

426.52 430.11 B: or people go to apply for jobs and if they don't have green cards 

430.38 439.14 B: um they tell them to go to this particular address in you know one of the nearby cities and they'll fix them up 

438.46 439.82 A: mhm 

439.39 443.15 B: and get them the documentation that they need 

443.17 455.52 B: well that was just very frightening [laughter] you know it's that easy and so she called the f._b._i. hotline remember there was they were publicizing if you hear and they were like okay fine thanks 

446.60 448.60 A: yeah yeah it is 

451.02 452.14 A: yeah 

455.86 460.07 B: they just were not you know they didn't ask any details or anything 

459.76 460.81 A: yeah 

460.53 469.04 B: so that was a little scary but you know who knows maybe they did get enough information you know we don't know how they follow up on these things 

468.31 470.41 A: yeah hopefully you know 

469.68 471.10 B: [laughter] 

470.58 479.33 A: i got an email a while back it was forwarded to me and it was from written by somebody that was in the military that supposedly knew a lot about bioterrorism but 

479.24 489.14 A: you know i don't know how legitimate it was but he says you know it's really hard for them he went in you know went into great detail to explain all of this different stuff it's hard for them to get enough of it 

489.21 491.33 A: into the environment to really 

491.61 497.60 A: hurt very many people and supposedly you know according to him most of it you can just wash off or you know 

497.17 501.61 B: yeah yeah i actually did hear something about that recently 

497.94 499.97 A: just get out of the area 

500.89 510.27 A: yeah he he made it seem like it wasn't nearly as serious and you know i try not to panic about things like that too i mean you know of course if you have respiratory illness or 

510.45 512.83 A: you know a bad immune system or something 

510.50 514.92 B: well that's right and some people are going to be more susceptible but in general 

513.17 516.02 A: yeah my son and i are very healthy 

516.12 519.09 B: yeah i think it's just a matter of 

516.60 517.39 A: (( so )) 

519.30 529.96 B: knowing you know of of of being aware like i said i mean but they i have heard that too that it's going to if they hit it's not like it's not like it's going to wipe out the city 

527.98 536.11 A: you know yeah i was originally picturing something like the plagues of the olden days you know everybody was just croaking left and right 

532.22 533.77 B: i know [laughter] 

534.97 537.74 B: right yeah well you know 

536.21 546.92 A: that's probably the best thing to do if it's on your skin you know it has to get into your blood stream or you have to breathe it or something like that it's the best thing to do is you know get out of the area don't breathe in the confined space if you can help it 

546.70 547.68 B: right 

546.97 551.27 A: you know get into fresh air and take a shower as quickly as possible 

549.65 550.57 B: yeah 

550.97 561.18 B: yeah yeah that's right i don't know you see all these people that are stockpiling gas masks and everything [sigh] but i don't know we haven't gone that far [laughter] 

556.81 557.78 A: yeah 

560.48 565.22 A: yeah and then what was this the government was saying go out and buy duct tape and oh 

564.53 566.98 B: [sigh] oh my goodness 

566.21 571.45 A: plastic wrap what were we supposed to do with the duct tape and the plastic wrap i don't get that 

570.83 573.59 B: i guess seal up your houses but then 

571.81 573.58 A: [laughter] 

573.68 577.80 B: wouldn't you suffocate eventually [laughter] i mean you know [laughter] 

575.10 576.57 A: yeah 

576.66 579.57 A: yeah if you make it so airtight that the 

579.67 582.66 A: chemicals can't get in how are you going breathe 

582.14 586.16 B: that's right yeah exactly you need fresh air too so 

583.10 584.11 A: [laughter] 

585.51 587.10 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

586.35 598.18 B: i don't know i mean i think it's just an unknown and people jump to conclusions and make announcements and even the government you know they are people [sigh] but um it is scary 

598.25 599.61 B: that's for sure
