6.07 7.50 B: [mn] good how are you doing 

7.32 10.53 A: i'm all right well would you panic 

12.00 15.18 B: i don't think there's a whole lot to do about it so you 

14.36 16.62 A: yeah [laughter] i don't think there is either 

17.71 19.42 B: (( know i [mn] you're )) 

19.48 21.28 B: i guess from the south aren't you 

21.25 23.72 A: ah yes i am from atlanta how about you 

23.25 24.65 B: i'm in tampa 

24.55 27.22 A: oh okay i i love tampa 

25.51 26.59 B: (( so ah )) 

27.23 34.52 B: yeah we have ah macdill air force base here so you know the central command so you know obviously 

30.64 32.48 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

34.53 39.05 B: i'm sure that's on the hit list if there is such a thing [laughter] 

38.13 51.11 A: well i'm sure it is i'm in a financial tower in atlanta that spans one of the ma key artery interstates and i'm in the building that is over the interstate we've already been told by the f._b._i. we're a target you 

41.80 42.83 B: mhm 

50.84 52.22 B: yeah 

51.60 55.86 A: know i mean we're to the point you know they police the parking that sort of thing 

56.16 57.46 A: yeah it's 

56.20 60.08 B: yeah and with with your airport up there being so busy [laughter] 

59.44 62.91 A: exactly um i mean 

63.27 70.50 A: yeah like you said i don't at the point you get it it's too late to panic and i unfortunately you just learn to live with it 

71.81 73.46 A: at least i have you know 

71.95 72.75 B: yeah 

73.74 76.92 B: yeah that's pretty much the same way with myself i just ah 

77.77 88.73 B: you know at at a point it gets almost redundant you know they're looking for something to to report on there [laughter] you know it seems like sometimes the news media is a little disappointed something hasn't happened 

88.53 97.29 A: you know that's a good point i was just watching the news over lunch and there's no news out there yet there's nothing going on 

97.68 98.69 A: um 

99.09 112.73 A: plus they're so fixated on the iraq problem which they need to be but there're a lot of other issues out there i mean let's face it the iranians have the capability to make a bomb now [mn] india and pakistan are still damn near a hot war you know 

113.16 117.17 B: and there's always the wild card in north korea 

116.54 123.84 A: well that's true i was an exchange student in south korea um yeah my guess is 

121.11 121.90 B: oh 

123.87 128.21 A: he's insane but we could probably buy him off for a short period of time 

129.50 130.41 A: so 

130.91 138.37 B: well that's that's becoming a little concern of mine too is that ah it it appears that we we're attempting to fight wars with a cheque book now 

138.96 143.24 A: [noise] well that's true but it's also something we've always done 

144.85 157.11 B: maybe it just wasn't so blatant you know it's like like [mn] it's like bidding with with turkey to have bases there you know [laughter] we'll we'll give you this much money if we ah we can have a base and they'll come back and say no we want more 

146.91 148.66 A: [noise] well that's true 

157.38 162.83 A: well and you know the big problem to me there is turkey is a nato ally 

157.88 158.86 B: (( [laughter] )) 

163.08 165.59 A: we shouldn't be having to bid at all 

166.35 168.96 A: i mean they are a member of nato 

168.45 170.33 B: so so is germany 

169.99 170.92 A: yeah 

171.38 176.06 A: this is true um and needless to say the germans 

176.36 186.38 A: well it amused me the comment i heard the other day the foreign minister of portugal hold on said that he had you know if anything happened 

181.60 182.52 B: mhm 

186.92 192.29 A: he doubted that the french and the germans would be there to help him but he knew that the united states would 

193.58 194.50 A: so 

195.47 207.05 A: you know it's interesting how [sigh] some of our allies look at it and some of them don't um and we need to look at the question of how much business do the french actually do with the iranian or iraqis 

207.28 210.76 B: yeah i think it's it's really a tremendous amount 

210.19 211.25 A: mhm 

211.63 217.98 B: (( and ah you know they're they're looking at ah you know they they finally realized that the beaujois weren't running beaujolais )) 

211.80 213.53 A: well it's it's also 

218.12 219.06 B: so 

218.21 219.61 A: that's right 

219.69 222.70 B: they're a little concerned they have all their oil contracts ah 

219.92 221.16 A: (( i )) 

222.99 229.64 B: that you know could conceivably be nullified by war if saddam's gone whoever comes in just says okay all bets are off 

229.68 234.79 A: [mn] well and if you're the russians you have the added issue of the fact that they owe 

234.99 247.42 A: the iraqis owe the russians about eight billion dollars and as a consequence it's going you know if they're not a part of the post war government they're probably not going to get paid 

249.11 250.03 A: so 

249.65 251.44 B: yeah i guess that's the you know 

252.10 256.59 B: we all want to get paid but i'm sure we've all had bad debts in the past [laughter] 

255.96 260.86 A: oh yeah oh i think that's a relatively common problem unfortunately 

260.90 262.75 A: especially in this economy 

262.55 267.79 B: yeah you say you're in a financial tower are you in the financial markets or 

263.67 264.48 A: so 

267.77 273.17 A: i am um i'm with a boutique financial services firm um 

273.35 282.30 A: basically what we do is we raise money for companies in the one to twenty five million dollar range either debt or equity financing 

281.47 283.33 B: mhm 

282.68 283.91 A: what do you do 

284.05 286.31 B: well i'm retired but i was in ah 

286.57 291.76 B: mortgage banking mortgage brokerage for quite a while and i i worked on wall street as a as a 

289.01 289.97 A: oh 

292.17 296.47 B: matter of fact i was working on wall street when they were building the world trade centre [laughter] 

292.28 293.36 A: okay 

296.61 302.90 A: wow [noise] from nineteen ninety nine to about two thousand and two i worked at the world trade centre 

302.65 303.92 B: did you yeah 

303.33 306.03 A: yeah [mn] or in the area or there 

306.91 307.82 A: so 

306.99 311.35 B: yeah i was in and out of the building more than once i'll tell you that [laughter] over the years 

310.40 311.25 A: (( oh were you )) 

311.35 315.21 A: you know i lived in the world trade centre marriott for a while 

314.70 315.99 B: mhm 

316.30 321.19 A: um i'm just sitting here there but for the grace of god could have been i 

321.35 325.16 A: you know i would have been in the hotel about that time of day too 

324.86 326.81 B: (( yeah )) 

326.20 327.12 A: so 

327.82 331.68 A: it's amazing how our world has changed in the last couple of years 

331.71 333.31 B: how is it affecting ah you 

333.63 340.47 B: know back to the terrorism thing have any of your customers given that any thought or are they just as essentially start up companies 

335.28 336.04 A: mhm 

338.14 339.33 A: oh yes 

340.87 342.61 B: just trying to look for a niche 

341.20 342.03 A: i 

342.59 349.44 A: well start up companies looking for a niche but where i'm noticing it is the companies when we try and place finance 

349.63 352.57 A: financing that's where we're having the trouble 

350.49 351.39 B: mhm 

352.71 358.46 A: people are you know concerned wanting to stay more liquid stay in safer investments 

358.59 365.25 A: that sort of thing where we would have been able to place equity a couple of years ago now we're placing debt instruments 

365.72 368.59 A: you know with a guaranteed dividend 

368.32 369.54 B: right 

368.99 369.85 A: um 

369.93 380.32 A: one structure we're looking at now is guaranteeing everything with life insurance policies so if you put up your investment you're getting about seventy to eighty per cent back if the company fails 

381.20 384.93 A: so it has altered our perspective somewhat there 

386.89 387.77 A: so 

387.69 390.65 B: yeah everybody's looking looking for the new angle my ah 

390.75 392.21 B: i i could do some 

392.50 397.13 B: finance you know not financial work for them [laughter] they're my broker morgan stanley 

396.82 397.74 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

397.35 402.00 B: and ah you know they're they've come out with i haven't really looked at it but ah 

402.52 412.26 B: you know a guaranteed two per cent return on your money but it also rises with the dow but never goes below two per cent 

411.72 416.48 A: hey that's nice especially in an environment where inflation is only one per cent 

415.87 426.54 B: yeah you know so you know it beats the heck out of the money funds not [laughter] [mn] but you know two per cent doesn't sound like much but it's double one per cent [laughter] yeah 

425.54 431.08 A: [noise] oh yeah i mean it certainly beats a you know just a cash management account 

431.62 445.67 A: which you know um a friend of mine i had to redo her four oh one k. for her the other day because all she had was a cash management account now granted she's lost no money but i at least found her a couple of bond funds where she'd get a little bit more return [noise] 

446.73 447.67 A: so 

447.38 449.29 B: i've been buying a little bit of ah 

449.77 453.32 B: what i i think are you know reasonably defensive 

454.27 457.80 B: you know corporate paper you know some preferreds and 

457.83 462.76 B: things like that but i'm sticking with the you know the general motors the dow chemical 

462.32 466.11 A: [noise] the companies that are going to be in business 

466.52 478.45 A: you know that's i've got a client the only guy i do any retail work with i moved him just because i said no matter who bombs what the ford motor company is going to be in business 

478.08 480.09 B: yep 

479.48 484.18 A: you know just no matter what you're getting ford for less than the cash on the books 

485.23 486.10 A: so 

485.90 489.46 B: yeah and there's you know it's a place you can still you know still park some 

490.52 500.55 B: ah some long term money you know and not especially some long term with with a a decent call on it you know you can still grab about five five per cent five and a half per cent 

492.40 493.54 A: definitely 

496.10 497.53 A: exactly 

500.08 502.21 A: oh definitely definitely 

502.31 504.63 A: how long do we talk on this or 

504.43 507.29 B: i i haven't been i haven't been timing but ah 

504.64 505.46 A: just 

507.39 510.37 B: you obviously have work to do [laughter] 

509.74 513.70 A: well i [mn] do you think we've talked long enough or 

514.82 524.25 B: i b i believe we probably have and i think we've stuck pretty much to the topic of i think we both we both agree that there's not a whole lot we can do about it terrorism that is 

519.04 519.97 A: okay 

523.06 530.95 A: no there really isn't i mean a there really isn't if it hits you're done i mean and it sounds awful to say it that way but 

531.20 532.19 A: you can't 

532.47 535.12 A: terrorists don't give warning 

534.65 542.40 B: yeah and ah it doesn't it's not going to do you any any good whether you're in pork bellies or ah jenny maes you're going to be just as dead [laughter] 

541.72 544.81 A: (( well and [mn] panic isn't [mn] )) 

544.89 549.27 A: unfortunately you're probably not going to be in a position to have enough time to panic 

548.97 550.44 B: (( yeah )) 

549.83 552.15 A: so well it was good talking to you 

551.69 552.89 B: good talking to you 

552.67 553.86 A: okay bye bye 

553.16 554.13 B: take care bye
