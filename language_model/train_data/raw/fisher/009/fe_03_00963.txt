5.17 6.58 A: about airport security 

6.60 6.88 B: yes 

7.26 8.25 A: um 

8.88 12.41 A: i think that um i think it's a terrific thing you know 

12.72 13.49 A: um 

13.95 17.50 A: especially you know in light of the threat of terrorism and um 

18.15 18.95 A: uh 

19.55 22.41 A: i know that it's they have done a lot to tighten up uh 

22.94 25.17 A: things that they already do and um 

25.74 28.43 A: you know it's a shame kind of in a way that it's all come to this but 

29.11 31.20 A: you know you have to take precaution so 

31.94 32.48 A: um 

32.77 34.12 A: do you what do you think 

34.34 37.10 B: well i i am in agreement uh 

38.41 40.47 B: it i i was traveling 

40.83 41.91 B: uh during 

42.12 44.50 B: the time-frame time-frame of nine nine eleven 

44.53 44.96 A: mhm 

45.17 46.68 B: and uh so i 

47.40 56.52 B: i had some firsthand experience with the change of the results uh i was across the country in uh california when when that occurred and uh 

49.97 50.74 A: yeah 

51.33 52.24 A: yeah 

57.13 58.00 B: um 

58.26 62.07 B: my first experience was that i was not able to fly back i had to drive back 

62.20 64.93 A: oh dear a lot of people were kind of stuck in this kind of 

63.32 65.84 B: uh 

65.68 66.14 A: things 

66.45 69.44 B: so but uh you know after that experience 

69.82 74.83 B: uh in in fact my my boss had been traveling with me on that one he opted to fly back 

75.42 76.82 B: uh but i 

77.19 80.60 B: physically carried several of his items because he knew they would be confiscated if 

80.97 81.95 A: if he yeah 

81.29 82.07 B: he were to flown 

82.18 82.60 A: right 

82.78 83.65 B: um 

83.79 86.12 B: you know since then i've traveled uh 

87.28 88.38 B: oh 

89.53 90.27 B: twice i believe 

90.53 90.98 A: mhm 

91.04 94.58 B: and both times uh the the heightened security 

95.63 96.67 B: was not as 

96.83 98.77 B: significant as i expected it to be 

98.78 99.25 A: mhm 

99.80 100.78 B: uh but 

101.60 102.39 B: you know the the the 

102.88 105.09 B: the first time i was flying out of my home 

105.19 107.20 B: area which is a very small airport 

107.54 107.93 A: yeah 

107.90 108.58 B: uh 

108.95 109.58 B: and 

109.72 116.79 B: the security there was drastically higher than it had been but it was it still seemed somewhat laid back 

116.70 117.18 A: mhm 

117.16 118.20 B: uh but com- 

118.37 124.27 B: compared to what it used to be with a small town airport it was drastically significant 

124.33 124.76 A: yeah 

124.73 130.77 B: and uh but at the same time you are scratching your head trying to figure what terrorist is going to leave from this little town 

130.79 131.28 A: right 

131.56 134.83 B: you know yeah 

131.60 132.67 A: right right 

132.83 140.88 A: in in in what effect does this have in the big picture of things you know how what i'm like you i've traveled probably 

136.53 137.72 B: right exactly 

141.12 143.87 A: two or three times since then myself and 

144.01 146.45 A: i i noticed that at the point 

146.71 147.28 A: um 

147.67 150.94 A: that you would kind of expect the security to be a bit more 

151.35 152.66 A: um tight 

152.96 154.06 A: it is not as tight as 

154.26 154.95 A: i don't know 

155.27 163.60 A: as i was expecting it to be but yet like the baggage check and so forth was more thorough much more thorough than 

156.49 156.85 B: mhm 

163.03 163.40 B: mhm 

163.72 165.13 A: than any i've ever 

165.37 170.30 A: ever been through before or since really but of course that was a pretty big airport 

170.17 170.59 B: mhm 

170.69 171.37 A: but um 

172.09 174.12 A: it it's definitely uh 

174.44 182.26 A: it's definitely changed everything as far as travel goes i've got a real good friend of mine is a flight attendant and um 

177.23 177.67 B: right 

182.37 183.03 A: you know 

183.12 183.83 A: things have just 

184.03 195.41 A: really really um they had to think about so many more things now than they did before nine eleven and they find or she seems to find herself in situations where she feels like um 

195.70 197.92 A: she may even be kind of um 

198.46 199.72 A: um like it is like 

200.07 201.01 A: she is trying to be 

201.22 203.13 A: um framed in to like 

203.29 204.11 A: a racial 

204.32 204.73 B: mhm 

204.48 208.20 A: profiling and things like that almost like she is being provoked 

205.41 205.80 B: mhm 

208.28 208.80 B: mhm 

208.32 210.48 A: so she they they get into real um 

210.64 211.16 A: you know 

211.36 214.00 A: tricky situations real nerve wracking 

212.28 212.82 B: mhm 

213.71 214.13 B: right 

214.23 214.97 A: kind of things 

215.27 218.43 B: but then again it is nothing they haven't had to deal with with a uh 

218.57 220.22 B: unruly passenger to begin with 

220.38 221.17 A: exactly 

221.27 221.78 B: so 

221.38 222.48 A: exactly 

222.22 222.77 B: um 

223.21 223.63 B: granted 

229.54 232.03 A: had too much to drink yeah 

242.36 242.79 B: other 

244.26 245.32 B: you know d- dangerous 

245.45 250.95 B: goods on board so i know the last time that i traveled before nine eleven 

245.51 246.12 A: true 

246.78 247.57 A: absolutely 

251.16 251.96 B: um 

252.78 256.17 B: we were traveling up to uh yellowstone and uh i 

256.61 262.25 B: insisted on taking my walking staff because i knew that i was going to need it i would never consider 

260.39 260.82 A: mhm 

262.42 264.61 B: flying with that staff now 

264.42 265.00 A: yeah 

265.01 267.12 B: uh one i would have to check it and 

267.24 267.81 B: it would be 

268.05 273.01 B: you know it's a one of a find item that was handmade and it would be destroyed and i wouldn't i wouldn't travel with it 

271.19 271.87 A: yeah 

272.82 273.27 A: right 

273.49 274.61 B: but uh 

275.12 278.03 B: at the same time both my wife and i wear uh 

278.52 279.99 B: handmade orthotics 

279.94 280.44 A: mhm 

280.23 282.58 B: which look like plastic 

282.65 283.19 A: yeah 

283.17 287.31 B: well they they are plastic they are probably (( propaline )) but for the untrained eye 

287.72 289.45 B: somebody who is looking for trouble 

289.78 290.58 B: they could look like 

289.79 290.19 A: yeah 

291.33 291.87 B: we are 

292.44 292.76 B: you know 

292.94 296.34 B: friends with mister reed 

294.42 296.46 A: right right 

296.66 297.18 B: so 

296.72 297.66 A: yeah 

297.31 298.16 B: so it is uh 

298.85 307.09 B: a a a and it it strikes home very close for us right now my wife is leaving in two or three days for london for a week and of course 

305.18 305.63 A: mhm 

307.57 310.28 B: the anticipation that maybe hostilities are going to 

311.17 311.91 B: actually take 

312.14 312.90 A: escalate 

312.14 315.17 B: effect while she is in transit 

314.98 316.35 A: true very true 

315.71 318.00 B: is terrifying for us 

317.34 317.95 A: yeah 

318.16 318.60 A: yeah 

318.78 321.34 B: so you know the hope is that uh 

322.03 324.78 B: that the security aspects are going to uh 

325.00 325.71 B: improve 

325.68 326.16 A: right 

326.11 331.47 B: the the h- u- r- at least at least i mean the the ideal situation is that they prevent something so that 

332.75 333.37 B: something that 

333.62 335.68 B: might have happened you never find out about 

335.73 336.40 A: right 

336.53 339.56 B: uh you know that that it never does take place so 

339.21 339.63 A: right 

339.84 340.94 A: and who knows 

340.27 341.34 B: at least that would be the hope 

341.45 344.20 A: i mean i often think myself that there is so many 

344.31 345.62 A: things that um 

345.95 350.14 A: that we probably don't have all the facts or information about 

349.69 350.47 B: oh without a doubt 

350.62 353.52 A: and i'm really i don't want i don't you know i 

353.81 359.58 A: i worry sometimes that we get too much information about security issues and about 

359.77 362.06 A: um even even national 

363.67 364.02 B: uh-huh 

368.19 370.10 A: also has this information now 

370.40 376.16 A: and i'm not always comfortable with that at all you know i don't think they need to know all our security 

372.33 372.73 B: yeah 

376.42 377.72 A: precautions and 

377.43 381.24 B: no no they they don't but at the same time uh 

378.10 378.86 A: and um 

382.53 390.94 B: us not saying that uh officially not saying what those precautions are you know darn well there are lots of precautions that are not talked about but uh 

389.34 389.78 A: right 

391.81 394.12 B: the very act i mean the very act 

394.33 400.42 B: of what has been done to improve security has changed our society so drastically 

400.58 401.04 A: yeah 

401.05 406.19 B: at this point that they have indeed achieved one of their goals 

406.19 406.87 A: right 

406.70 412.12 B: the goal has always been to change that free american society to be a little bit more repressive 

412.13 412.56 A: right 

412.74 414.58 B: and indeed they have done that 

414.43 416.36 A: they they have they have accomplished that 

415.46 416.01 B: um 

416.68 418.80 B: at the same time most countries in europe 

418.92 420.66 B: kind of shock their heads and said 

420.95 421.75 B: why 

422.74 431.88 B: you know what what is the big deal it is the same as the european countries looking at us and saying why are they so upset about gas prices getting almost to two dollars a gallon you know that's 

430.78 431.34 A: yeah 

432.03 434.32 B: that is what the rest of the wor- world pays 

434.26 437.13 A: right that is what we've been paying yeah 

434.82 438.23 B: so what 

438.34 443.63 B: so that is what the rest of the world pays so you know and and the same goes for airport security most of the 

444.01 444.87 B: most of the airports 

445.01 446.47 B: uh in europe have been 

447.12 449.06 B: far more secure to the point where 

449.25 450.86 B: you know the average american traveler 

451.46 451.94 B: uh 

452.68 453.27 B: would be 

453.92 454.48 B: distressed 

454.66 456.12 B: by some of that security 

455.87 457.57 A: oh definitely i i'm not 

457.69 459.62 A: myself i've not traveled 

459.91 462.21 A: abroad or not gone to europe or anything but this 

462.32 468.20 A: friend of mine that is a flight attendant has done has traveled extensively to europe and um 

463.36 463.69 B: mhm 

469.04 474.66 A: uh j- just a lot of international travel and she said just up until nine eleven you know that was always 

471.24 471.60 B: mhm 

475.23 483.96 A: b- best thing about coming back to america would be the the relaxed security and it felt great not to be in in 

477.53 477.92 B: mhm 

480.25 480.66 B: mhm 

484.13 484.69 A: um 

484.89 489.24 A: you know it just felt great to be in a freer society you just feel it 

485.50 485.90 B: mhm 

487.70 488.53 B: right exactly 

489.50 490.61 A: but like you say that 

490.74 493.98 A: one of their objectives have you know they have met that now so 

495.15 496.39 A: but what do you do i mean you 

496.52 497.16 A: can't 

497.32 501.85 A: just let -em we got to be safe for everybody's benefit you know 

499.52 500.09 B: that is right 

502.38 503.07 A: so um 

503.91 504.55 A: i uh 

505.04 505.90 A: i can't help but 

506.05 506.58 A: think that 

506.90 509.89 A: the tighter security at airports also can't 

510.01 510.57 A: um 

511.00 513.98 A: i can't help but think it won't also effect other 

514.55 519.39 A: um kind of criminal elements like you know uh drug smuggling and um 

516.52 516.88 B: mhm
