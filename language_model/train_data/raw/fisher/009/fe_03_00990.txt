0.23 1.24 B: (( hello hi )) 

0.77 2.23 A: hi 

2.55 3.96 A: my name's donna 

3.73 6.21 B: my name is ria from new york 

5.94 7.43 A: did you say lydia 

7.16 9.12 B: ria from new york 

8.55 11.05 A: ria from new york i'm in delaware 

10.61 11.67 B: (( you're in delaware )) 

11.82 18.77 A: and [sigh] okay ah what do i think the question is what do you think the u._s. can do 

18.95 20.25 A: to avoid 

20.34 22.35 A: bioterrorism right 

21.72 23.06 B: mhm 

22.97 28.55 A: [mn] okay i guess this is a little over my head but i'll try 

29.24 30.12 B: [mn] i don't 

29.32 32.39 A: unless you can give me your opinion first [laughter] 

31.61 39.89 B: right i don't basically think they can do too much because they can't they can't watch everybody and everything and all you need is a little packet 

40.40 42.77 B: (( it can contaminate a whole train )) 

42.48 43.77 A: that's true 

43.83 46.24 A: that's true i'm not 

45.21 49.27 B: i think if they really wanted to go there they can they very much can do it 

49.78 54.96 A: i think they might have kind of proved that with the anthrax you know like 

53.67 54.79 B: mhm 

55.00 64.59 A: uh how quickly it can spread and how much damage it can do with so little but how are they planning to you see i don't [mn] know the different types of 

64.71 68.62 A: uh bio chemicals and how they're 

65.07 66.60 B: (( that's another thing )) 

66.72 70.10 B: that's another thing we don't even know what we're looking for 

69.55 71.24 A: (( yeah )) 

70.27 73.72 B: so how can they prevent it if they really want to do it 

74.21 76.50 B: mhm it's scary isn't it 

75.87 81.23 A: well yeah it is it's okay how much do they know 

76.97 77.64 B: (( [mn] )) 

81.55 85.34 A: as compared to how much do the do the 

83.64 85.58 B: (( they're letting us know right mm )) 

85.40 98.33 A: well no how much do the terrorists know about getting this stuff across and how to sneak it in and how to you know where to place it and what it does to the body what kind of scientists do we have that 

88.32 89.43 B: mhm 

98.38 99.45 A: um 

100.08 101.85 A: [mn] come up with the 

101.92 113.71 A: you know the chemicals and know how many people it'll kill at one time and so how much of that does the u._s. know also because wasn't it this case somewhere i remember it 

114.11 118.49 A: very vaguely about um gas 

119.07 127.79 A: ah they used some kind of tear gas or some kind of gas to get the people out it was it was a huge amount of people i think in a theater somewhere 

127.21 133.12 B: mhm they did it too one time in i'm thinking japan or china the subway systems there 

128.08 129.66 A: and 

132.95 139.39 A: oh yeah now that i do remember and it's just so i mean it's a scary thought because you never know 

133.80 135.18 B: mhm 

139.51 143.11 A: who and you know we lead such a busy life that 

143.19 149.15 A: um well then again i i guess that's uh it depends on how much you use public 

149.41 155.41 A: transportation in that sense but how okay what can they do to prevent it ah 

151.17 152.21 B: mhm 

155.50 158.11 A: well if they're smarter than those guys 

158.17 168.32 A: then they could try to stay one step ahead of them maybe maybe the u._s. was being um noncha- too nonchalant about oh they won't do this 

166.57 167.49 B: (( yes they start )) 

167.67 169.27 B: (( calling their bluff you know )) 

168.74 178.69 A: yeah they think that those people think like we think you know and you know no they don't think like that yeah yeah they don't 

173.22 174.15 B: mhm 

175.17 177.50 B: (( i don't think they're too civilized myself )) 

177.92 178.52 B: (( mm )) 

178.94 186.83 A: have the morals that the u._s. has and um they really they it's it's hard you know what makes it so hard 

186.89 188.31 A: is um 

189.16 191.01 A: these people want to die 

190.97 196.26 B: yeah and they don't care that's right and they won't mind taking a bunch of us with 

191.26 195.11 A: for their cause for what they think they're willing to die so what can you 

195.71 198.19 A: yeah what can you do 

198.23 200.20 A: with that i mean shh 

200.10 210.28 B: them i don't see nothing that they they can do they can keep up their little watch and checking everybody's packages and stuff but the ones that they should be checking they're not doing 

210.27 218.67 B: i mean i really think they should have a blocked mail from anybody even coming from that country over here now until we get this straight we've got some kind of understanding 

214.95 216.02 A: yeah 

216.66 217.97 A: oh boy 

218.60 231.90 A: oh boy and you know and it's it is scary because you don't know how much the government tells you it seems like we are on a need to know basis you know okay like um ju- just like this guy that was just here over on this 

221.66 222.56 B: mhm 

223.59 224.60 B: right 

225.54 226.69 B: mhm 

232.12 236.87 A: side doing all these killings the two guys that were doing the 

235.10 236.13 B: (( uh-hum )) 

237.24 248.67 A: just picking people off just at random you know those guys until they came unto the public and said look the guys are driving a such and such car and that's when somebody in the public actually said well hey you know 

238.68 239.54 B: yes 

239.69 240.55 B: mhm 

249.08 250.70 A: lookee here you know 

250.97 255.17 A: i found this guy but i don't think they would tell us until they abso- 

255.04 256.24 B: yeah like 

255.50 258.89 A: -lutely have to because they really don't want to have any control 

256.31 259.70 B: (( we have to be protected from panic yeah huh )) 

259.39 261.88 A: and panic you know what panic people 

260.07 261.08 B: (( yeah )) 

261.46 267.33 B: and panic even more when they do tell us and they tell us also that they can't do nothing about it 

266.66 272.14 A: and you know what mass panic is is is what they are afraid of because 

267.62 268.39 B: (( mm )) 

272.18 284.24 A: you know the police are out here and so forth and the armed forces but they can only do so much when so many people just lose it or something over something like that you know it's like mass panic they cannot control they don't want 

280.59 281.61 B: mhm 

284.04 292.08 A: t- it leads to things like r- riots and things you know people on the edge even after september eleventh you know people were going and being 

292.09 294.59 A: (( vigant- what do you call them um )) 

294.13 295.97 B: vigilantes yeah 

294.77 302.72 A: yeah vigilantes you know [mn] and taking it out on people just because they looked like they were from over there you know so um 

300.86 301.86 B: (( mhm )) 

302.01 309.27 B: and i thought that was going happen here in new york in a big way but in reality they didn't do it they really didn't do it 

306.98 308.04 A: yeah 

308.61 312.36 A: so what can they actually do well 

313.09 314.55 A: i think the only 

314.63 327.41 A: option they might have is i don't think the question is what can they do to stop it because they can't stop it but how can they have the least amount of casualties how quickly can they respond to something 

325.04 326.05 B: right 

326.20 328.98 B: that's what i was thinking about right then too 

328.56 329.90 A: yeah 

329.27 333.59 B: show us some antibodies you know things like that you know 

330.95 333.12 A: yeah or something you know 

333.21 339.71 A: and you know you see they've done that with the doctors and so forth and everyone getting shots in 

337.36 338.39 B: (( yes but )) 

339.15 340.11 B: but what 

340.32 345.55 A: n- yeah no w- [laughter] i think we're casualties you you know we're 

341.36 342.32 B: (( about us )) 

342.60 343.86 B: [laughter] 

345.72 349.29 A: those necessary casualties of war you [mn] know 

347.87 349.79 B: (( mhm yeah you know )) 

349.13 363.79 A: somebody is going have to unfortunately it's like when a lot of things in life something tragic has to happen before something is really done about it even though all the telltale signs point and say look this is going to lead to this this is going to lead to this this is going to lead to this 

363.71 368.82 A: you know until something actually happens tragic do they actually move anything 

367.57 376.19 B: and then that's when the panic starts because everybody going to try to seek help at the same time well we all can begin to prepare for this now mhm that's 

372.31 373.69 A: yeah 

375.59 383.24 A: okay so since they can't prevent it and since it looks like there are going to be some 

383.15 394.77 A: casualties somewhere along the line why not equip us by giving us the information that we need um to inform ourselves as informed citizens to protect ourselves and our families 

394.17 395.01 B: right 

394.79 398.84 A: you know so let us make that decision don't play with our lives 

398.29 402.71 B: mhm and don't keep busting a blind about things that you all already know 

402.32 404.75 A: yeah yeah you know so 

404.34 414.98 B: because some people some people can take care of themselves you know and not just physically with the antibodies we also need to prepare ourselves mentally and emotionally for this kind of thing you 

406.88 407.89 A: mhm 

413.31 415.69 A: yeah yeah y- 

415.25 418.41 B: know just all of a sudden this hit us like that 

418.04 421.42 A: [sigh] boy well you know what i think we kind of got our 

421.40 422.33 B: mhm 

421.50 435.11 A: our eyes and ears open now as far as the public [mn] y- you know like w- we're aware that [mn] come on you know the united states was in a lull a sleeping lull like we were this big giant that you know no-one would dare 

431.28 431.93 B: (( mm )) 

434.97 435.87 B: yeah 

435.12 443.32 A: and here you know they show that no we don't care about that you know you big the bigger you are the harder you fall [mn] so um 

438.78 439.85 B: mhm 

443.33 446.36 A: ah so i guess i can that there's not 

446.46 455.65 A: uh what they should do is inform the public they should educate uh the public as to what types of chemicals 

455.52 464.20 A: uh bio chemicals are out there how they affect the body you know get some kind of web sites together or something that informs that you know people can get there quickly 

457.23 458.10 B: mhm 

459.32 460.10 B: (( right mhm )) 

464.09 468.61 A: find this information out and try to at least prepare themselves and be aware 

468.49 480.34 A: of something might that might look suspicious now whereas it didn't if you didn't have this information you know things to kind of be on the lookout for that might look out of place or something or or you know 

478.60 479.52 B: yes 

480.29 485.28 B: and right now they can be doing this to us right now we wouldn't even know the side effects and nothing like that 

484.69 485.96 A: yeah 

485.36 489.98 B: people would be out here walking around with colds might not be a cold you know 

488.64 489.72 A: yeah 

489.86 496.14 A: yeah and you know we're so quick to go to work [mn] with colds go to schools with colds go on kids go to school 

492.42 493.47 B: mhm 

494.26 499.16 B: right and then and then there's a a have a long-term of effect 

498.88 499.90 A: yeah 

499.30 501.59 B: but they can be attacking us right now 

501.29 504.16 A: yeah [sigh] so 

503.58 506.00 B: no way and no one's saying nothing 

505.67 506.66 A: yeah 

506.04 508.02 B: and then the last minute 

507.90 509.36 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

508.37 513.46 B: and while we've been watching it on the t._v. that's when we know right [laughter] 

511.82 526.29 A: well you know what i don't even trust so much the the news media i've learned [mn] over the years that you know [mn] they're not always going to give you the right scoop either so like i say i think education is its best 

522.38 523.32 B: (( mhm right )) 

526.20 535.37 A: the united states best weapon or you know it'd help you know it's a it- since it seems like it can't be prevented at 

528.69 529.72 B: mhm 

530.86 531.68 B: yes 

535.73 541.57 A: least you know don't like if if something happens over here ah and somebody dies and they say oh 

541.38 551.50 A: oh this is what it is and everybody's running to the doctor like you said everybody's running everybody wants to get inoculated now and everybody you know and there's that mass panic whereas you know if you educate us now we can 

551.38 559.82 A: make our own uh uh decision as to okay do i think that this threat is enough for me to go and take this antibiotic or 

559.04 559.98 B: (( mhm mm )) 

560.12 565.66 A: enough to take these precautions when it comes to protecting my children because you know [mn] 

565.70 572.48 A: face it we really take too many antibiotics and our bodies my husband says it all the time you know our bodies grow immune 

568.14 569.10 B: mhm 

572.54 585.33 A: and and so when something really comes along you know and we try to hit it with antibiotics [mn] it's nothing the antibiotics or the the germs are mutating into something else you know because the our systems are so used to that so 

582.18 583.09 B: mhm 

585.37 588.63 A: uh again i say my thought is 

588.66 599.89 A: educate the public get some web sites together get some flyers out in the mail mass mailings maybe make people aware of what type of 'cause w- when i first heard this
