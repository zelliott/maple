124.90 126.06 A: have you 

124.90 135.49 B: especially here yeah especially here i think sometimes either they know something's going to happen or somebody's in the airport cause we get a lot of you know v._i._p. through our airport

166.31 166.89 B: strict 

167.33 171.68 B: about you couldn't take your coat through it had to go through the x-ray machine

210.58 212.26 A: and huh they would be i'm being
