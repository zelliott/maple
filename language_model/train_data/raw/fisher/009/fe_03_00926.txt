20.26 22.03 A: he sure was 

21.77 24.12 B: they had to ask us a tough question huh 

23.69 26.23 A: they have they really have 

24.49 27.15 B: oh my gosh [laughter] [laughter] 

27.47 28.57 A: y- y- 

27.91 31.31 B: i was hoping to get like an easy one like i was supposed to have yesterday 

31.84 33.18 B: which was like 

32.11 38.06 A: they were i know the one i saw the other day was on health related issues and i'm a nurse so that would have been perfect 

37.48 40.14 B: oh that would have been great [laughter] 

38.71 44.00 A: yeah it would have [laughter] that is a hard one that they've asked us but you know i guess 

44.92 46.73 A: it's something that's really 

46.77 49.20 A: majorly in the news these days 

48.33 52.31 B: yeah that's i got the news on right now and that's all they're talking about 

51.73 52.87 A: (( right [mn] )) 

53.58 56.23 B: so i i don't know if we've 

56.74 59.09 B: we will be successful in disarming them 

60.10 64.59 B: i mean there there's i'm sure they'll always have something to hide some place to hide somewhere 

64.27 65.90 A: i think so too 

65.20 66.36 B: yeah 

66.34 73.53 A: i think so too it's kind of a hard issue to know kind of where i stand even because i don't have 

73.56 82.83 A: aged children that would be able to go over right now i'm sure it'll be a tough issue if you had yourself or or children that that would be sent over right now and 

82.16 85.36 B: right yeah mi- mine are little luckily 

83.08 84.60 A: (( to start a war [mn] but )) 

89.16 94.03 A: it's it's kinda hard to say where i would place myself right now i do think something should be done 

94.18 95.22 A: um 

95.37 99.72 A: to try to disarm them and tr- to try to keep them in line but 

100.44 103.24 A: i don't totally know what i think that should be 

102.76 109.11 B: i know i know it's so hard to understand oh there goes my call waiting i think i'll ignore it though [laughter] 

107.84 108.84 A: [laughter] 

110.91 118.99 B: yeah i i don't know ah it's it's so hard it's like well it should stop soon because we don't want them hurting anyone else 

119.44 123.74 B: but then again who are we to tell another country exactly what to do 

125.85 126.77 B: so 

126.82 128.93 B: and i know it all comes down to 

129.99 132.45 B: actually i don't know what it comes down to [laughter] 

132.36 133.58 A: yeah 

134.02 141.52 B: the funny thing is my ex is in the military so you'd think i'd be more in tune to these things yeah he he's in the air force 

138.65 139.89 A: oh really 

141.43 144.40 A: is he overseas or anything right now or 

143.75 145.67 B: i have no contact with him 

145.34 147.40 A: do you not no 

145.94 146.80 B: (( no )) 

147.00 151.09 B: no ah last i heard he was flying air force two for um 

151.21 153.92 B: at the time it was president ah vice president gore 

153.46 154.72 A: oh wow 

154.24 156.87 B: yeah it was it was exciting for him i guess 

156.42 161.17 A: my father was actually a pilot also he was in the navy at one time 

160.60 161.89 B: oh how cool 

161.52 162.85 A: yeah 

163.12 164.45 A: but um 

165.96 175.01 A: i do kinda stand behind bush i think that you know i i'm hoping that h- he's the type person that'll lead us in the right direction and uh 

174.90 181.34 A: to make the right decisions i don't always agree with everything he does but i do respect him so 

178.90 180.24 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

181.20 184.02 B: yeah i think he's done a wonderful job since nine eleven 

183.69 185.27 A: i think he has too 

185.13 187.94 B: yeah and then then tell you the truth i did not vote for him 

188.29 192.63 B: see i was like oh no i don't want another bush in the white house but i think he's done a remarkable job 

192.20 204.17 A: i think he has too i've really grown re- you know all right i did vote for him and i already respected him but you know things that have happened since then my my esteem of his him has really gone up 

203.60 204.95 B: oh definitely 

204.66 209.21 A: i i think he's helped this country through one of the most difficult times it's probably ever gone through 

208.81 212.74 B: and let's hope it's the last time it's ever we've ever gone through something like this [laughter] [noise] 

212.21 223.82 A: and the the problem is i don't you know you don't you can't believe that it is though because of all the stuff that's going on and and all the problems and all the scary people in the world 

216.14 217.28 B: i know 

223.23 224.95 B: oh i know it's horrible 

224.97 227.90 B: i live in a tiny little town so i'm hoping you know 

228.03 231.35 B: keep hoping oh well we should be safe down here but you never know 

232.12 234.50 B: you know we're not that far from d._c. 

234.59 235.89 A: that's true 

235.39 239.49 B: so yeah we're about an hour and a half from d._c. so yeah

240.08 240.81 A: they 

242.15 247.47 A: from all the news reports i've seen they say unless you live in an area like that you know 

247.61 259.33 A: very closely to an area like that that more than likely anything that they could have or would have for short term stuff is is pretty much not going to affect you 

258.98 260.31 B: yeah 

259.38 263.56 A: right now so it kinda made me feel better when i heard that [laughter]
