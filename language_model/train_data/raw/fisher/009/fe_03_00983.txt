50.11 51.30 A: that you can use uh 

51.51 59.49 A: that much duck tape and plastic to fully seal your house and then if you do seal your house uh what are you going to do when you run out of food and water you (( gotta )) go outside 

59.60 60.25 A: sometime 

68.09 70.25 B: since it's the year two thousand when they 

70.44 72.90 B: the world was (( gonna )) end they had asked us to do that

86.43 86.94 A: okay 

90.44 99.20 B: i think the the secu- you know as far as um the anthrax and all that type of stuff i just think it's something that american people have to stay on top and beware of things 

99.74 102.57 B: i don't think there is any other way that we can protect ourselves 

99.94 100.44 A: right 

103.09 104.54 B: we have to keep our guard up 

104.77 105.81 B: other than that 

104.80 105.87 A: yeah and i'm an uh 

106.01 114.67 A: and i'm afraid of the of of the uh they have a vaccine for smallpox isn't that yeah and you can get sick from that vaccine 

114.95 115.73 B: that is correct 

115.88 118.24 B: that is correct um it is um 

119.01 123.60 B: i don't know you're age but i've had i've had that vaccine when i was a child 

123.86 124.26 A: uh-huh 

124.37 129.50 B: so i'm more or less susceptible too since i've already had it as a child i know that i could have it again 

130.15 135.04 B: but people who are under that age don't know and it is a fear you know it's it's a big fear 

134.28 136.44 A: i think i had it also -cause i'm fifty eight 

137.10 140.15 B: oh you're fifty eight okay i'm fifty so if you had it be- 

138.32 138.79 A: uh-huh

140.73 151.06 B: i know if you had it before you have less of a chance of having a um a reaction to it um that's what i've been told um my son is a doctor 

147.45 147.87 A: oh 

151.43 151.87 A: okay

152.89 153.39 B: he 

153.51 154.02 B: he would 

154.36 158.44 B: he is a little sceptical of taking it though i'll be honest because he never had the vaccine as a child 

158.96 159.86 A: so are you (( gonna )) take it 

159.07 159.76 B: ah

162.98 163.94 B: you know it's it's 

164.64 170.34 B: i think i would only for the fact that i don't think i want smallpox because as a child i had it

317.74 323.43 B: no uh ah because it's you know and again -cause you don't know who it might be someone from 

323.22 323.72 A: that is right 

324.02 324.83 A: right right 

324.33 333.25 B: another country and that is an awful way to feel and unfortunately i like like you like like to have an open mind as far as trusting people but you can't stay

346.14 347.05 B: oh really 

347.16 347.94 A: yeah i 

347.23 348.06 B: that is a shame

350.79 351.31 A: you know 

351.75 352.34 B: right 

351.81 352.40 A: they are getting ready to 

352.73 362.14 A: pull out a gun or something and hijack this plane and that is awful i mean that is you know that is i'm a black person so i know what i feels like to be you know 
362.28 362.67 A: to 

362.92 369.65 A: uh have people think that you are you know just because you are black that you know you are a criminal or whatever and i'm sure that all 

368.76 369.58 B: and that is a shame 

370.47 370.81 A: excuse me 

371.10 376.19 B: that is a shame that people have to feel that way -cause i'm i'm white and i was raised in a very prejudiced 

374.08 374.55 A: uh-huh 

376.58 384.41 B: parents and unfortunately i i didn't like it and i told my kids to be the opposite because you can't judge people by their skin their color or 

384.13 384.67 A: i know but 

384.99 385.86 A: but i'm jus- i'm 

385.03 385.75 B: their money

416.05 417.20 A: but you know what 

416.24 419.15 B: but i think that is any way we are going to do it
