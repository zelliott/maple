311.13 313.10 A: because like [noise] 

312.16 325.78 B: i got hooked on a._b._c. family always had marathons and even if i'd already seen like the bachelor i would just i would be like i don't remember who he kicks off this time so i'd have to watch it it's addictive

323.52 325.26 A: mhm mhm 

325.90 329.61 A: [noise] yeah and they just get people to come back every week because

390.79 401.12 A: yeah um comparing joe millionaire to bachelorette though the girls on that seemed to be very very petty like they had a lot like very materialistic and petty girls 

399.63 400.53 B: you mean 

400.84 405.10 B: like the bachelor like all the contestants i agree

442.59 449.09 A: and how do they read the people like and what they're like do they have to take like personality tests or what come in [noise] 

448.71 458.25 B: whoever did the ones for bachelor i think did a great job because the g- i could deal with those girls like there weren't girls that i hated really i mean some 

455.14 456.35 A: yeah 

456.55 458.03 A: (( yeah uh huh ))
