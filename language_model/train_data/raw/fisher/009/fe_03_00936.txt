4.79 6.10 A: how are you today 

6.54 7.62 A: good 

7.79 10.36 A: that's an interesting topic isn't it [laughter] 

9.62 13.42 B: it is yeah [laughter] yeah 

10.59 13.75 A: [laughter] at least it's fun [laughter] ah 

13.85 14.77 A: oh 

13.88 18.68 B: yeah there's always preparations going on for whatever the next holiday is 

18.36 24.64 A: right ah i think my favorite holiday is christmas 'cause it brings out the child in me what's yours mhm 

24.55 31.52 B: i would agree christmas is my favorite it's it's the time when i get together with relatives and um 

32.01 34.22 B: everybody takes the day off on christmas 

34.08 46.38 A: yes [laughter] it it it um it's so much fun because all the lights and just the everybody it seems like everybody's so festive and and they're even better that time of year 

34.64 35.89 B: [laughter] 

45.98 47.21 B: mhm 

47.25 49.27 B: i agree yeah 

48.01 49.40 A: [laughter] 

49.66 62.26 B: it's ah it's the one time of year w- that i actually decorate my house and make an effort to make things really special and and focus on the family traditions and do things we don't do other times of year 

55.70 57.10 A: mhm 

62.42 63.55 A: right 

62.87 68.18 B: and people come from out of town and it's nice to have dinner with people you don't see very often 

68.26 72.58 A: i agree with that it's an excuse for all the family to get together [noise] 

72.33 79.16 B: and it's something that my son and my nephews look forward to for months in advance which is really fun 

80.12 93.68 A: my daughter learnt um she just realized about christmas this year so um all this year she's been asking if santa claus is coming today [laughter] i had to say no soon but not right now [laughter] 

88.72 90.11 B: [laughter] 

93.38 97.87 B: uh huh yeah an- and when they're really young co- the concept of time is 

97.92 98.84 A: right 

98.07 99.75 B: hard to grasp 

99.23 106.60 A: right um i think the other question was if we could create a holiday what would that be 

106.22 108.55 B: yeah that's an interesting question 

108.20 109.47 A: (( mm mhm )) 

109.55 114.89 B: um if i could change anything about christmas i would want to make it less commercial and i would 

115.04 120.58 B: i would ah i would have less shopping and buying and giving presents i think 

120.66 132.06 B: 'cause i think recently people h- have started really going overboard on presents like the crossing guard in our town near the school she had this huge pile of presents [laughter] i just thought that's a bit much 

120.94 121.81 A: right 

130.01 131.10 A: [laughter] 

131.99 134.22 A: and that was the crossing guard 

133.41 135.63 B: (( [laughter] yeah [laughter] that was the crossing guard )) 

136.63 138.19 A: [laughter] 

137.52 140.62 B: we don't even know her name and people are buying her stuff 

140.18 148.01 A: [laughter] i think um a lot of the time ah people really go into debt for these big presents for christmas 

141.96 142.55 B: (( [mn] )) 

147.73 149.16 B: yeah 

148.41 151.43 A: and i feel it's really unnecessary 

150.91 152.15 B: yeah 

152.91 156.74 B: so maybe if if i were to design my own holiday i would want it to b- 

156.86 164.65 B: be focused on getting together with the people that are close to you family and friends but there wouldn't be an obligation to buy gifts for people 

164.70 166.83 A: that's a good one i like that one 

167.18 172.80 A: i think mine would be something to do with celebrating um children 

172.85 173.82 B: mhm 

173.39 175.22 A: just um 

175.35 186.02 A: maybe parents and relatives and friends of children just taking the day out to spend time and realizing how special the children are 

185.76 189.48 B: i think that's great and i think that there are other cultures that do that 

189.22 190.93 A: (( do they okay )) 

189.93 191.64 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

190.96 194.66 A: i think that would be really important because i think a lot of times um 

194.71 197.85 A: our children get kind of looked over 

197.43 198.42 B: mhm 

198.34 202.04 A: you know you've heard that phrase have you hugged your child today 

202.19 206.89 A: and i think um a lot of times we don't pay attention to that [laughter] 

206.25 210.39 B: mhm so how would you celebrate it what would you want to do with the kids to make them feel 

210.22 217.29 A: um [lipsmack] i think oh goodness [laughter] now you put me on the spot i can't think 

210.61 212.08 B: appreciated 

215.88 219.65 B: [laughter] first of all no school that day [laughter] 

218.82 222.51 A: yes definitely no school um 

219.80 223.81 B: [laughter] no work for the parents 

223.34 229.47 A: right no work for the parents that's a good one and maybe just um 

224.80 225.81 B: [laughter] 

230.00 239.24 A: gosh i wanna say take 'em to the zoo [laughter] [laughter] but just ah maybe have a day of family activities um 

232.43 233.63 B: mhm 

239.74 246.66 A: maybe calling relatives that may not be in the state to get together mhm 

245.09 246.18 B: mhm 

246.77 248.21 A: um 

249.39 253.21 A: i don't know goodness [laughter] 

251.58 252.23 B: (( [laughter] )) 

253.54 258.82 A: [laughter] and just kind of spending time you know talking with your children and and just um 

259.28 261.75 A: letting them know [noise] how special they are 

261.33 262.28 B: mhm 

261.94 266.49 A: and if you don't have your own children maybe a [noise] child in the neighborhood that 

266.58 271.10 A: might not have a large family or or things like that 

270.47 271.50 B: mhm 

271.71 272.61 A: so 

273.28 274.12 A: (( mm )) 

274.21 275.94 B: yeah i think that sounds great 

276.40 279.28 B: i think that when when kids feel appreciated 

279.30 284.07 B: when they're children that's something that they carry with them into adulthood 

284.42 287.05 A: right it helps build their self esteem 

286.47 287.67 B: yeah 

287.66 293.53 A: and um i think they end up being more of a a rounded person 

293.18 294.75 B: mhm i agree 

294.61 295.79 A: um 

296.98 298.57 A: a lot less 

299.84 301.33 A: um 

302.60 306.70 A: [mn] less reliable on other people for that 

307.19 311.23 A: (( boost of confidence they have it inside them i think )) 

312.25 313.18 B: (( mhm yeah yeah )) 

312.44 313.26 A: (( some )) 

314.90 317.59 B: i think it's also good to have um 

318.15 326.21 B: to give kids some activities some like responsibilities for things to do like maybe have them in charge of doing something nice 

326.25 330.42 A: [sigh] yeah because then they feel like they've 

330.58 332.46 A: put something into it 

331.78 335.90 B: yeah like maybe they have their own special job that day or something i don't know 

335.97 340.19 A: well that's a good one i know my daughter really um enjoys 

340.23 347.68 A: well she's only three but she really enjoys helping around the house and helping me do things and she'll say mommy can i help 

347.30 348.60 B: mhm 

347.66 357.52 A: so i think maybe children actually have that kind of built into them where they want to help just sometimes um they don't know how or we don't give them the opportunity 

357.08 357.98 B: mhm 

358.29 360.00 A: that would be a good thing 

361.11 364.26 B: like maybe they could make cards for their parents or something 

363.75 366.08 A: mhm yeah 

367.57 369.74 A: yeah i think a lot of times um 

369.81 378.67 A: like you said making something like a craft or or something like that it's more of a hands on instead of just um i think a lot of times we 

378.74 384.14 A: let the children sit in front of the t._v. or such instead of [noise] having them do things 

384.12 385.21 B: right 

384.87 389.74 A: like when we were younger i think we did more with our parents you know we were 

389.79 394.02 A: out active doing things instead of just sitting in front of the tv [laughter] 

393.51 396.67 B: yeah well we certainly didn't have cable or 

396.82 399.97 B: v._c._r.s 

398.54 400.11 A: right [laughter] 

400.73 403.07 B: or computer games 

401.94 407.69 A: [laughter] oh yes the computer games i tell you [noise] that's really gone off [laughter] 

407.03 408.05 B: mhm 

410.33 414.95 A: um let's see here can you think of any other holiday you would want to do 

415.59 416.88 B: um 

418.43 429.97 B: [mn] well i've been hearing about the mexican holiday where they c- they celebrate their dead ancestors and we don't really have an equivalent like that here i was wondering if that would work in this country where people 

429.88 438.04 B: remember the ancestors that they that they knew the relatives that they knew who were no longer alive and maybe hear stories about people that they didn't know 

438.02 444.07 A: [noise] [mn] oh that's really good [noise] because that would be a way of passing on um 

444.42 449.50 A: [sigh] maybe different traditions or a few [noise] ideas that their ancestor had [noise] 

449.08 450.11 B: mhm 

449.94 454.66 A: you know a way of keeping their family spirit alive 

454.02 460.57 B: right and r- and passing on information you know stories about who did what and who was what kind of person i'm 

460.50 461.65 A: (( [noise] right )) 

461.11 464.34 B: concerned about that being lost over over time 

464.63 466.71 A: definitely i think um 

466.97 468.84 A: a lot of times 

469.87 471.92 A: we tend to 

471.99 476.32 A: more [noise] concentrate on the [noise] grief of losing someone [noise] than 

475.09 476.32 B: mhm 

476.48 478.62 A: celebrating their life [noise] 

477.88 479.29 B: (( right right yeah )) 

479.45 481.73 A: that's that's definitely true 

483.28 487.29 B: so i think it'd be interesting if we had a holiday kind of like that here 

487.26 490.83 A: yeah that would that really would because um 

491.39 494.46 A: we have so many different um 

494.70 504.09 A: ethnic backgrounds and and stuff like that where if we did have that it would be a great opportunity to learn about other people 

496.14 497.18 B: right 

497.59 498.51 B: (( right )) 

502.47 503.78 B: right yeah 

505.12 506.39 B: yeah 

505.16 518.75 A: you know i'm kind of i don't mean to be but there's a lot of things that i don't know about about different people and what they've ah learnt in their countries and different practices that they have but i would love to learn about some of that stuff 

518.16 519.15 B: mhm 

521.12 522.25 A: (( hmm )) 

522.34 524.82 A: ten minutes is a long time when you're trying to talk 

523.76 524.59 B: [laughter] 

524.98 526.84 B: [laughter] 

526.22 529.75 A: [laughter] [laughter] um 

530.04 535.44 B: do you have any plans to do anything uh um for the first day of spring to celebrate that 

535.99 545.75 A: no but i probably should [laughter] i've already been getting myself ah active in my spring cleaning 'cause i love the fact that the sun's out right now 

537.72 539.40 B: [laughter] 

545.22 546.21 B: mhm 

546.12 551.39 A: um it's it's so sunny and i can't wait till the snow melts and [laughter] 

550.43 551.44 B: mhm
