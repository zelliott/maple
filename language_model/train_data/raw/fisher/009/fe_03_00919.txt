298.18 299.47 A: so it was kinda funny 

298.65 301.24 B: was it like a what kind of forum was it

333.16 343.04 A: oh yeah [laughter] i was supposed to get paid ten dollars for talking ten minutes to a stranger and he knows i do a lot of really weird things like that so he was thought that was really funny 

343.29 344.00 A: [laughter] 

343.30 347.86 B: yeah totally [sigh] i don't know it's weird but 

348.05 357.71 B: i don't know what exactly they want to know i mean like about reality television it seems kind of weird like do they just want to see how people actually communicate with each other like 

358.01 363.50 B: 'cause i i found it 'cause i was looking up linguistics on- online like for school 

360.75 361.79 A: mhm 

361.85 362.64 A: oh 

363.12 364.30 A: yeah 

363.71 369.52 B: for this school project i was working on and i was like sweet i can talk to somebody for ten minutes and make ten bucks 

369.12 371.82 A: [laughter] yeah 

370.04 371.20 B: (( [laughter] you know )) 

371.25 377.51 B: i don't i don't really know what they want to kn- i mean are they like some sort of is it statistical information for 

376.72 387.71 A: i asked um when they called me with my p._i._n. number and they said they they study and record it um for different purposes one of them to develop voice recognition software 

378.51 379.52 B: yeah 

388.44 390.19 A: so i thought that was interesting 

389.49 391.59 B: oh that's kinda creepy 

391.52 395.74 A: [laughter] you know we're being recorded [laughter] 

393.60 394.54 B: [laughter] 

395.41 398.27 B: yeah yeah huh 

396.95 397.66 A: (( [mn] )) 

398.66 404.98 A: but um yeah i f- i- it's like i thought it sounded like an interesting way to make ten dollars 

399.17 400.18 B: we are 

405.92 409.08 B: yeah except for now it's like like they have my 

407.27 420.24 A: yeah and they pick different topics the topic yesterday was season and the topic the day before when i was on hold was oh what was it i think it was health or illness or something like that 

420.25 421.11 B: (( oh )) 

420.43 422.71 A: illness illness was what it was 

422.74 423.87 B: yeah 

423.47 427.97 A: so and i had a lot to say about illness but there was no one to talk to [laughter] 

427.60 430.58 B: yeah maybe it's 'cause it's a later time slot you know 

430.46 437.32 A: yeah that's what i was thinking for me i mean you're an hour a- oh wait you're in the same time zone but when you're in alaska you're an hour earlier than me aren't you 

437.30 438.72 B: yeah totally 

438.31 442.91 A: yeah so i picked this time because i figured this is the time i'm most at home 

442.99 445.79 B: yeah exactly and like i'm not really doing anything 

445.33 446.93 A: (( uh huh uh huh )) 

446.34 447.06 B: so 

447.51 455.56 B: yeah i i really wonder what exactly they want to know about people you know are they just like how they communicate or is it some kind of weird government thing or 

455.11 456.71 A: [laughter] 

455.99 461.28 B: you know i mean who knows and who g- i mean really who gives a shit about reality television i 

461.60 467.44 A: well i would think sponsors and producers might but they seem to be doing fine without our input 

462.46 463.93 B: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

467.48 468.53 B: yeah 

467.75 472.46 A: so they they get they have those shows i can't believe how many people watch those things 

472.60 476.86 B: yeah it's just kinda like tabloids you know or something i don't know but 

474.90 475.71 A: yeah 

478.23 479.74 B: (( [sigh] weird )) 

479.52 480.69 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

479.93 481.02 B: anyway 

480.84 486.86 A: it's like you said it's um it- it's like addictive and it just sucks you [laughter] in 

487.66 489.77 B: yeah i i kinda feel like it's like 

490.32 498.86 B: i don't know i really haven't watched i- i've seen like a tiny bit of american idol and i've heard people talk about survivor but 

500.43 501.46 B: (( i don't know )) 

500.53 503.23 A: i don't know if fear factor is considered one 

503.72 504.74 B: oh really 

503.72 512.65 A: i don't know if it is but i i've watched that a couple of times too and it's like the the one where they eat things are so gross 

512.66 518.09 A: or i guess they eat things or they have bugs crawl on you or stuff like that and it's like that is totally gross 

513.08 513.87 B: (( i )) 

518.80 528.66 B: mean come one like like the reality for most americans is like living in a double wide trailer like eating greasy food [laughter] you know what i mean like 

527.33 528.17 A: [laughter] 

528.68 530.40 B: driving a truck

536.61 537.72 B: (( i don't know )) 

538.56 540.17 B: it'd be interesting if it was 

540.37 541.51 B: if they really 

541.96 545.87 B: wanted to know what real people did like the majority of people 

545.65 546.79 A: yeah 

546.34 550.78 B: in our country it wouldn't be very interesting i don't think so you know but i don't
