0.09 1.31 A: hello 

0.73 2.26 B: hello 

1.70 3.16 A: my name is veevee 

2.94 4.71 B: my name is stanley bush 

4.61 8.20 A: i'm sorry what was it stanley nice to meet you 

5.52 7.03 B: stanley bush 

7.77 8.96 B: (( nice to meet you )) 

8.78 11.70 A: and we're supposed to talk about airport security 

11.07 12.01 B: yes 

11.80 13.61 A: okay go ahead 

13.54 16.73 B: ah what do you think about airport security at this moment 

16.82 21.77 A: well i think it's probably a pretty good idea with everything that's going on in the world 

22.28 23.44 A: what do you think 

23.36 30.22 B: i think i- [mn] i think really it's kinda too late ah yeah 

27.74 28.69 A: too late 

29.19 33.15 A: yeah well we've certainly had disasters you know a year and a half ago everything 

32.98 36.70 B: yeah plus a ah me i think they public the public 

37.38 39.74 B: we talk too much about what we're gonna do 

39.36 46.33 A: oh yeah that's true that's really true because you know you see it on the news and they and you know they're watching the news just like we are 

46.03 56.05 B: mm so they like anything we seem to know that we're gonna do it like security wise they would know anyway and that give 'em a chance to ah bypass it 

52.78 53.73 A: mhm 

54.30 57.28 A: yeah yeah that's probably true 

56.06 58.96 B: and i think ah i also think ah 

59.67 61.57 B: you know our rights 

62.09 64.97 B: you know to ah you know privacy 

64.45 65.70 A: mhm 

65.13 68.41 B: you know i think they've been violated too 

68.03 69.55 A: mhm 

68.97 73.14 B: 'cause like they got security now where they can see everything straight through you 

72.78 76.21 A: well that's pretty bad too yeah [laughter] 

73.32 74.10 B: (( to y- )) 

74.52 76.68 B: to you know to the skeleton bone 

76.24 77.60 A: mhm 

76.86 79.47 B: and i think that's invading privacy 

79.00 90.51 A: [lipsmack] and i think you're right they're looking at ways to get around it because they know what we're doing and that guy with the bomb in his shoe he came from france so all they have to do is come from a different country instead of coming from the u._s. 

86.49 88.27 B: yeah 

90.63 94.55 A: and then they just you know it doesn't matter what we do 'cause france didn't screen 'em 

94.49 96.59 B: yeah 

94.69 102.48 A: or whatever it was [mn] i think he came through france or england and they didn't screen him and that he was on his way to chicago or somewhere like that 

103.06 105.84 B: (( well i think if they're going to um [lipsmack] )) 

106.97 112.94 B: beef up security you know then that should um open more jobs up for people also 

113.06 115.13 A: you mean like at airport security 

113.15 114.48 B: but i think 

114.56 122.66 B: yeah you know 'cause you know they're going to do more airport security and that you know that gonna put a lot of strain on a lot of people that already there for security 

115.21 116.25 A: mhm 

121.97 123.50 A: mhm that's true 

123.12 127.47 B: plus the thing is you know a lotta airports going bankruptcy 

127.19 128.41 A: mhm 

128.04 129.04 B: (( you know )) 

129.57 135.96 B: even though i don't really think people are really looking for you know trying to catch a plane [noise] you know [noise] 

133.96 136.27 A: that's right that's right 

136.19 139.82 B: and that one thing i did not agree with that a pilot having a gun 

139.78 141.92 A: mhm yeah 

141.21 145.91 B: you know 'cause a p- a pilot can't do nothing really 'cause he's flying a plane 

143.88 144.78 A: no 

145.78 149.26 A: that's right and somebody could get the gun away from him and then they would have the gun 

147.76 148.73 B: (( yeah )) 

148.76 155.99 B: plus they p- you know advertised that on the news where a pilot's going to start carrying a gun so that's like telling them okay we got a pilot going to have a gun 

151.57 152.27 A: mm 

155.98 157.95 A: mhm that's pretty scary 

156.58 161.05 B: and plus if he shoots the gun and it penetrates the airplane 

160.69 164.12 A: [laughter] mhm 

161.27 163.30 B: you know then there's more disaster 

164.01 166.25 B: but i think they should do a better w- [noise] 

167.54 168.70 A: mhm 

168.82 171.99 A: have you flown on an airplane since um nine eleven 

171.46 172.43 B: (( [mn] no )) 

172.15 173.70 A: [mn] i've flown 

172.67 175.05 B: i haven't been on a plane since then mm 

174.51 184.52 A: mhm yeah a lot of people are avoiding it now we were ah my husband and i were going on vacation and um they stopped l- little kids an- and i know you could put a bomb on a little kid if you wanted to but 

184.31 190.99 A: that's not the people who we need to watch out for and they were stopping old ladies and stuff just like you hear on the news they were stopping people like that 

190.84 197.75 A: and they're letting other people go through who looked a lot more suspicious to us there was a guy getting on the plane behind us and he was 

197.58 207.32 A: apparently he had some sort of mental condition and he was like muttering and spluttering to himself and everything like a like a kind of a mentally disturbed person and they didn't stop him he just walks right on 

202.16 203.13 B: (( oh )) 

207.31 216.87 A: and not to say that he's a terrorist but he could have had you know he could've kinda gone crazy and tried to hurt somebody and they didn't stop him and then they were stopping little kids 

216.10 218.44 B: (( [mn] [mn] they were stopping little kids )) 

217.85 222.30 A: mhm [mn] little kids little kids with checking out their stuffed toys and stuff 

223.39 225.39 A: so maybe they need to do some 

225.53 228.11 A: i don't know thinking about who they're stopping or 

228.23 234.39 B: [mn] [noise] well i understand like the one guy they stopped going on had a knife in his umbrella 

228.81 229.71 A: (( i don't )) 

234.05 236.26 A: (( know oh yeah i didn't hear about that )) 

234.77 240.35 B: yeah he got on board with it when he got to where he was going near where he was going then they caught him 

239.97 241.78 A: so that was too late 

240.89 249.72 B: [noise] yeah [noise] you know but the only you could make a weapon without um using metal though 

242.07 243.86 A: it would've been too late anyway 

249.53 250.95 A: mhm 

250.26 254.12 B: you know still you know bypass their security 

253.37 259.94 A: yeah i'm sure that you could really if you were really bent on it you could use your shoe string to choke somebody or you know anything 

259.97 267.19 B: [mn] you know y- you're talking about a pilot having a gun you you could use something else and if you get the gun away from him [mn] you know 

265.59 266.70 A: mhm 

267.24 275.50 B: i just think they should not advertise about what they gonna do with airport security and just keep it between the ah people who're doing security [noise] 

272.28 274.03 A: yeah 

274.98 277.44 A: that's probably a good idea i think that's right 

278.05 282.44 A: yeah i don't know anybody who works for um airport security do you 

282.23 283.22 B: (( no )) 

284.15 291.41 A: no i guess they were going to be hiring some new people but i don't know if they did or they just changed the jobs the existing jobs over to federal jobs 

291.24 304.94 B: well they i guess they gonna um do a lot of background checks [noise] also with people y- you know [noise] before they hire security 'cause i you know a security guard can um you can pay h- someone off 

291.84 293.67 A: 'cause that's 

298.42 299.66 A: that's probably a good thing 

304.68 307.54 A: mhm yeah easily 

305.32 306.32 B: you know 

307.39 312.10 B: then you know they can plant something you know someone could come pick it up but 

311.09 312.67 A: mhm yeah 

312.84 314.34 A: i'm certain they're going to get 

314.59 317.13 A: think of ways to get around it if they want to 

317.43 327.42 B: i think should should you know not publicize on the news about what they gonna do about security wise for the airport and ah just keep it a hush hush 

324.32 325.48 A: mhm 

327.40 328.36 A: right 

327.54 328.59 B: (( you know )) 

329.36 331.13 A: that'd probably be a better idea 

330.31 333.07 B: then the people just have to deal with it you know 

333.15 337.22 B: when they go into the airport long as they don't say nothing 

334.68 335.76 A: mhm 

337.37 338.30 B: (( you know [mn] )) 

337.39 341.13 A: i guess that's what people were complaining about the lines being so long 

341.24 342.97 A: at the airport mhm 

342.18 344.23 B: yeah a lot of delays 

344.57 345.39 B: (( you know )) 

344.67 350.12 A: having to take off their shoes and stuff but you know what if it saves their lives i think that's probably worth it 

350.90 354.15 A: [mn] you just have to leave earlier to get to the airport get where you're going 

353.72 356.07 B: (( yeah a lot of people would be in a rush )) 

356.10 366.08 B: wait till the last minute then want to try and get up then when they get down there when they get checked for you know through security then um then they're complaining 'cause they had to be there so long 

358.32 359.90 A: yeah 

365.88 367.51 A: mhm yeah 

368.23 369.92 A: yeah 

368.86 370.95 B: [mn] but i figure they should do have 

370.98 373.53 B: [mn] you know figure better ways 

373.55 374.57 B: you know 

374.14 376.33 A: you agree with the background checks though 

376.40 378.44 B: the background checks yes 

377.31 380.08 A: [mn] on the people the people who work there 

379.35 391.87 B: [mn] yeah but you o- you have to have a bad background if you're surely gonna do something you know they find the people they had for the planes you know they brought 'em in took 'em to sch- you know went to school and everything you know 

383.30 384.31 A: mhm 

389.94 391.05 A: mhm 

391.92 397.54 B: but they had a you know they knew what they wanted to do they had clean backgrounds [noise] you know 

395.75 396.63 A: right 

398.07 398.69 A: (( mm )) 

398.70 401.51 B: and still you know did nine eleven 

401.72 402.79 A: that's right 

402.66 405.58 B: but the thing is i don't know why people [mn] you know 

406.66 412.94 B: [noise] you know i don't know it's just hard you know how they having things now they just making it harder 

412.77 414.00 A: mhm 

413.56 419.50 B: and to me they just [noise] you know talk too much you know i've been in the military for eight years [noise] to me they just talk too much 

419.05 419.99 A: mhm 

419.74 421.87 B: [noise] about what they gonna do instead of doing it 

421.87 423.51 A: are you in the military right now 

423.18 425.53 B: [mn] i'm trying to go back 

424.47 425.52 A: oh okay 

426.03 427.13 A: what branch 

426.84 428.01 B: (( [mn] army )) 

427.98 428.54 A: (( mm )) 

429.47 431.38 A: so you're trying to see if you can get back in 

431.45 435.77 B: [noise] yeah already getting my paper trying to get my paperwork together 

435.11 440.14 A: really even this time of everything going on that's why you want to go back 

435.80 437.62 B: yeah 

440.58 443.01 A: because of a- all the the war coming up 

442.90 446.98 B: no it's just how things are at this moment you know 

445.74 448.89 A: mhm mhm is that your best decision for right now mhm 

449.90 451.36 B: (( [noise] female )) 

453.79 462.30 A: oh oh we're talking about the wrong thing [laughter] well we [laughter] i can't think of anything more to say about it [mn] let me see um 

456.45 457.07 B: (( [noise] )) 

462.90 464.76 A: [noise] um well 

464.93 473.13 A: [mn] i know um my husband and i have actually been to a foreign country s- i mean it's not a big foreign country but it's the bahamas you know since nine eleven 

471.02 472.04 B: [noise] uh-huh 

472.92 483.52 A: and um it seemed real easy for americans to get back into the country which is fine you know it's they had two different lines one for a passport if a ah american passport and one for a non american passport 

483.36 484.27 B: yeah 

483.68 490.94 A: and our line went real fast and that's that's okay except for i suppose a terrorist could get an american passport i don't know they could probably fake one 

490.25 493.18 B: how was the security on the um overseas 

493.14 494.74 A: it wasn't bad at all 

493.51 495.59 B: the airport security 

494.82 497.92 A: it wasn't bad at all it was pretty lax 

498.03 507.60 A: 'cause we were coming on and i guess they just figured we're all americans and you know nobody wants to attack the bahamas so i guess they feel like they're not at risk so there was um 

507.78 511.19 A: you know there w- there was really hardly any to tell you the truth 

511.73 519.58 A: and but i you know i don't think that they're they're probably right the terrorists don't have any reason to target them because it's america that they're mad at 

520.85 522.76 A: not ah not the bahamas 

522.17 528.41 B: [noise] mm you heard anything lately on the security [noise] the any updates on airport security 

527.67 534.66 A: mm no not lately and you'd think you would because of the you know probably things are going to start happening maybe in about a week 

534.76 547.69 A: you know 'cause that's what bush is saying that there might be a war in about a week [mn] you'd think that i work at a v._a. hospital and they're talking about um a red alert coming up pretty soon you know th- you have all those different levels of alert 

547.38 548.51 B: (( yes [mn] )) 

547.89 558.15 A: and we were on orange alert for a while but now we've gone back down to and that's like a medium level and we've gone do- back down to like hardly any but they're talking about going up to the highest level 

558.19 563.51 A: so that's about the only thing i've heard i suppose if we're on high level ah airports are on a high level too 

563.73 565.17 A: high level alert 

566.79 570.05 A: [mn] so but that's you know that's probably going to be in about a week from now 

572.75 577.13 B: how about the um you hear about the n- um that new sc- um [mn] 

578.13 584.63 B: the new detector they have the one when they ah you walk through it screens your whole body 

584.04 590.04 A: uh-uh yeah i heard about that a a while ago is there something new on that or are th- are they actually using that 

589.51 597.69 B: [mn] i head they was doing tests on it they had it o- o- at one airport yeah that's all i heard of it 

594.40 595.59 A: mhm 

597.38 599.89 A: and i- they didn't say whether it was um
