20.53 22.22 B: [laughter] 

21.54 29.05 A: (( [laughter] i was actually thinking about signing up for a different time of day 'cause it's so rare to actually get someone at this time of day )) 

28.64 32.17 B: yeah yeah well 

32.72 34.78 B: um what do you think 

34.73 39.31 A: well i am definitely against the war over there i think that 

38.59 39.85 B: (( oh yeah )) 

39.22 54.21 A: um i think it's pretty ridiculous what they're doing it's like bush wants to go ahead with the war no matter what people all over the world are against it and people are trying to raise awareness and trying to say no we don't want this and he's still consistently trying to go to war 

52.90 55.96 B: to push it yeah yeah 

55.34 69.87 A: so i i think that you know what they're saying about the disarmament i was just watching the news last night i don't get a chance to do that often but han- hans blix was saying that they actually seem to be disarming a little bit and yet we're still like oh let's just go to war [laughter] 

69.40 71.19 B: yeah yeah 

70.22 72.30 A: so what do you think 

71.90 76.57 B: well i was telling a friend this this evening that i even 

76.58 90.55 B: even without you know nine eleven happening we were going to have conflicts but i didn't think it would it would be escalated to this point however being that bush is in office i think this is what this is kinda like at the top of his agenda 

90.69 91.91 A: mhm 

90.77 93.27 B: to to get at um hussein 

93.41 94.33 B: but 

93.64 101.73 A: do you think that that's the point that he wants to get hussein or do you think maybe it's just he's trying to distract us from the the terrible economy we have 

96.57 98.62 B: ah yeah i i do 

100.70 106.81 B: exactly exactly yeah yeah i just you know as soon as he got into office 

102.02 102.98 A: [laughter] 

103.34 104.68 A: yeah 

106.92 109.41 B: you know everything just went down hill 

109.59 110.71 A: (( mhm )) 

110.38 111.66 B: yeah so 

112.03 119.11 B: um but i'm think- i'm i'm hopeful that you know um hussein does cooperate and um 

119.42 120.41 A: mhm 

119.84 124.57 B: remove those weapons and whatever else he may have over there and cooperate you know 

125.46 128.97 B: um at least fifty per cent more 

125.53 126.48 A: yeah 

129.07 133.96 B: you know and that'll give us some hope but yeah everybody around the world is against it 

133.41 134.56 A: yeah 

133.98 138.29 B: and i think that if we do go to war we will lose a lot of our power 

138.33 139.27 A: mhm 

138.35 140.65 B: and things will never be the same for us 

141.37 145.50 A: right like we're not gonna be secure in our own country i don't think 

144.60 146.83 B: exactly exactly 

145.83 151.90 A: like this homeland security is a joke it's the exact opposite because everyone in the world's gonna be against us 

149.14 150.09 B: yeah 

151.33 152.41 B: right 

152.40 153.72 A: mhm 

153.10 166.36 B: yeah and you know and even now you know i'm fearful i want to travel outside the country and you know it's like any time we could go to war an- and who's to say that you won't even be able to get back in the country even though you're a citizen 

158.16 159.05 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

164.48 165.67 A: yeah 

166.39 167.88 A: (( yeah for real )) 

167.49 168.71 B: you know so 

167.91 172.45 A: 'cause then they'll be like where have you been and why did you leave and what have you been doing 

170.69 175.01 B: exactly you'll be interrogated even though you are a citizen 

173.50 174.06 A: (( mm )) 

175.02 176.46 A: it's ridiculous 

175.95 177.34 B: yeah 

176.68 189.64 A: i'll probably still go though i love traveling and like you know it's really sad how many people don't travel 'cause they watch the media and they get scared it's like that's the whole point that's why they're trying to scare you don't listen [laughter] go travel anyway 

179.21 180.04 B: i do too 

186.54 187.62 B: right 

187.76 188.78 B: right 

189.63 191.37 B: yeah yeah 

190.73 191.51 A: yeah 

191.55 192.48 B: so 

191.59 192.45 A: mm 

193.31 196.10 A: well i i don't know like do you think that 

193.34 194.13 B: (( ah )) 

196.17 206.90 A: it's i 'cause i think it's a big reason we're going to this war is because the economy is falling apart you know like he's the schools are struggling everything's was struggling already 

206.80 219.92 A: and then he's taking even more money away and putting it towards fighting instead of finding more money from the military and putting it towards schools and everything else like i love that bumper sticker that it'll be like it'll be a fine day when 

208.80 209.92 B: (( right right )) 

219.82 228.14 A: the u._s. military has to have a back sale to pay for the weapons they use [laughter] and schools have all that they need to have class 

224.62 225.96 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] yeah )) 

227.61 232.14 B: yeah and and the sad part about it is they're not even giving them new equipment 

232.78 240.55 B: i've found out you know they they're giving them you know antiquated equipment and some of it doesn't doesn't even function properly 

232.98 233.90 A: no 

234.22 235.97 A: right exactly 

237.75 238.76 A: yeah 

240.57 246.92 A: well i know some teachers that had to buy their own paper and pencils for class which is never it's not usually that way 

246.55 247.61 B: mhm 

247.18 249.22 A: (( and they're having to go get their own stuff )) 

248.96 250.71 B: yeah yeah 

250.01 257.54 A: but there are people that are going over right now that are being like human shields in iraq and i was thinking that would be neat because um 

257.57 271.05 A: it's like i listening to n._p._r. and this guy he was basically for peace he wanted no war and then he went over to do n._p._r. stories and after looking around meeting some people and hearing stories about how saddam had treated them 

271.28 278.08 A: then they de- they he realized how bad it was and he decided he'd start going to war with the this was about three or four months ago 

277.73 278.82 B: wow 

278.54 288.06 A: and um so that made me wonder what are the people really living like you know if they're really living a really detrimental bad day to day life where they're dying anyway 

288.23 292.14 A: well then it seems more logical if you're gonna die anyway okay i mean 

292.07 306.93 A: if we can take him out of power and give them all a better life i think it's worth it but that's that's the only place i've heard that most everyone else is all saying like this is ridiculous and yeah the life there isn't as good as ours but it doesn't mean we need to intervene 

294.46 296.37 B: right right 

306.99 311.66 A: to make it better like where's our right to do that [laughter] 

310.77 315.40 B: yeah well i've heard stories you know where people or families you know 

316.15 326.44 B: if they make it ou- if one person in the family makes it out you know they can't even help you know their their other family m- members that are there and they can't even say anything 

319.69 320.62 A: mhm 

326.47 332.38 B: you know for fear that their their family will be tortured or or yet worse you know um killed 

326.62 327.74 A: oh really 

332.59 333.46 A: (( mm )) 

332.76 336.82 B: which is really bad you know and if that's if that's 

334.59 335.60 A: yeah 

336.98 344.98 B: you know an indication of hi- of his uh leadership then yeah something needs to be done it's you know it's about human rights 

342.58 343.70 A: right 

345.20 355.69 A: mhm yeah that that's the thing and i think bush doesn't actually talk about that very much which either number one it's not as bad as some people say it is like it's maybe not that bad 

355.34 356.32 B: right 

356.39 358.75 A: or he would be talking about it you know 

357.76 359.63 B: right r- exactly 

359.23 370.36 A: if it's really that bad i would think that would make a lot of us more convinced that we need to help it's more like a power trip right now we're gonna beat saddam it's not like we want to help the people 

369.71 374.41 B: absolutely it's a power ego trip for him and 

372.93 377.66 A: yeah and like money and oil too all that mhm 

375.80 380.53 B: exactly all of that and i think that's been his agenda all along you know 

380.30 381.31 A: (( right [mn] )) 

380.65 383.13 B: and um i think that 

383.29 390.39 B: he must have promised his father all along like if i ever get into office you know i'm gonna go get him okay 

387.97 388.71 A: yeah 

390.03 391.67 A: (( yeah [laughter] that's right )) 

391.60 392.87 B: [laughter] you know 

391.97 394.96 A: i'll finish your job you can stop now dad i'll come along 

393.57 398.29 B: right right you can retire [laughter] [laughter] you can retire 

395.62 399.26 A: [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] yeah really 

398.67 402.51 B: yeah but it- it's you know i feel really sad 

399.75 400.46 A: ah 

402.93 404.06 A: mhm 

402.94 409.15 B: for all you know for everyone that's involved in that especially you know um our military 

406.33 407.65 A: mhm 

409.37 418.04 B: you know having to leave and go over there leave their families and you know and leave whole towns just almost empty you know 

412.93 414.13 A: yeah 

417.58 418.80 A: it's true 

418.93 422.14 A: have you known many people that are going over yet or anything 

421.89 430.36 B: and um actually i don't my son um actually got out of the military last year and he knows quite a few people 

430.08 431.24 A: (( oh yeah )) 

430.67 435.53 B: that have gone over and yeah he's told me about he lives in um 

432.47 433.79 A: mhm 

435.64 443.06 B: fayetteville north carolina and he's told me about how you know empty it's even become because you know everybody's been shipped out

455.06 456.07 A: right 

455.77 459.63 B: you know and then my neighbor her brother he's um 

459.68 461.96 B: sixty one years old and they called him 

462.18 463.35 A: (( yeah )) 

463.04 465.99 B: [laughter] yeah even for a desk job but they called him 

464.10 465.04 A: (( wow ))

472.15 473.43 A: (( that's crazy [noise] )) 

473.97 477.73 A: mm like they're really putting people to work huh 

477.23 479.68 B: yeah they definitely are 

478.65 480.43 A: (( [noise] wow )) 

481.01 489.55 A: well i i have a couple friends who are going over there and what's interesting is they're really excited you know it's like 

489.53 496.20 A: i've been training for this i'm so excited to finally use what i've been learning and i'm like dude do you really 

492.89 494.57 B: right right 

496.18 506.41 A: see the big picture here like they want to have the experience of going what what this training has been all about you know a friend of mine was even in the reserves and after nine eleven he joined again 

502.66 503.57 B: right 

506.29 507.29 B: (( mhm right right )) 

506.55 508.87 A: back in it's like i'm thinking 

508.98 515.80 A: um i understand where you want to get your learning in and stuff but do you really want to go and be a part of killing people for no reason 

516.89 527.71 A: yeah they've kinda lost track of the big picture then and it seems like the media's very convincing like i love to watch like b._b._c. the british um british news station 

526.67 528.05 B: (( uh huh uh huh )) 

527.99 537.97 A: it's so much more objective i've lived in europe and [mn] the news i'd hear over there was more objective it seemed like a lot more um realistic what's going on and what are people saying 

538.21 542.72 A: um i liked seeing the news last night they actually showed hans blix talking 

542.74 547.69 A: and that way you could see what they're really saying and not the biased media perspective 

548.05 553.97 A: because that's what i want to know is what's really going on i wish i knew someone that was over in iraq right now it'd be like what's going on there really 

552.98 555.94 B: mhm right right right yeah yeah that's true 

556.21 560.25 B: true i've always felt that you know um our our media 

556.26 557.13 A: yeah 

560.39 565.10 B: has always sensationalized things you know on their behalf not 

565.01 565.92 A: right 

565.35 568.39 B: necessarily you know for us you know 

568.00 569.17 A: mhm 

568.54 570.30 B: keeping us informed 

570.37 570.96 A: ah 

570.56 571.65 B: (( never )) 

571.88 575.26 A: right not objective it's whatever it's going to benefit them 

574.73 576.39 B: oh yeah yeah 

575.59 579.11 A: like the media and the government works so hand in hand [laughter] 

578.38 582.37 B: [laughter] yeah definitely great bed partners [laughter] 

580.77 581.48 A: (( oh )) 

582.66 590.60 A: [laughter] yeah oh wow so are you involved in anything to like any of the peace rallies or anything like that
