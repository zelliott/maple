63.37 65.99 B: yeah well used to be not so much anymore 

65.96 66.52 A: uh-huh 

66.68 68.51 B: as a matter of fact my husband is kind of 

68.68 72.67 B: obsessed with trying to get on the show but i think he has finally given up 

72.51 73.32 A: really 

73.20 74.40 B: yeah 

74.24 78.73 A: wow that's bad my husband has been hooked on um the new um

90.80 93.64 B: i've watched that one not too much though 

93.68 97.21 A: no i haven't either i've seen it for the first time the other night and i only caught a part of it 

98.37 100.43 B: it just didn't do it for me 

100.03 101.33 A: yeah i know it 

102.54 104.71 A: huh so i then i wonder then what happens 

106.11 108.55 A: like does the recording thing come back or 

108.62 109.81 B: i have no idea 

110.05 111.88 B: i think they record the whole conversation but 

112.17 114.21 B: i think it's supposed to be a ten minute call right 

115.05 117.06 B: so i assume at some point it says 

118.01 119.91 B: okay you've talked long enough 

119.99 122.22 A: yeah i don't know um 

123.38 129.32 A: i don't know i would guess though as far as like reality t._v. goes that um people are in to them 

129.43 132.42 A: you know because i mean it's like everybody's life you know 

132.53 133.39 A: that you don't get to

250.82 251.50 A: oh really

358.42 362.48 A: what do they do just like send you um a thing telling you to go to this restaurant 

363.75 367.91 B: some of them actually have job postings and you can sign up for it right online 

368.02 371.14 B: and others of -em it's kind of like a lottery first come first serve 

371.35 371.89 A: really 

371.97 373.40 B: yeah but it's it's kind of neat 

373.74 375.38 A: i uh it sounds really neat 

382.52 386.06 B: a seven fifty food allowance and you have to order a couple different meals 

386.26 391.20 B: but um like the nicer restaurants they will pay you like forty dollars which is 

386.41 386.87 A: uh-huh 

391.35 393.64 B: i mean not nice like a family style restaurant 

393.95 395.13 A: wow 

394.72 396.74 B: which is enough to get uh 

397.50 398.04 A: right 

397.78 400.20 B: you know like two adult dinners and two kid dinners 

400.46 400.87 A: right 

401.38 404.67 B: or roughly in there and and then you know after you finish 

405.07 406.07 B: they 

406.89 408.09 B: you you write up a report 

408.62 411.49 B: and they want to know different things like people's names how much 

411.82 414.25 B: spend how long did it take you to sit how did they 

414.63 417.28 B: treat you were they friendly and then like time frame

420.57 422.75 B: you know they want to know how all different kinds of details 

423.30 424.21 A: now i wonder if it's 

424.33 424.59 A: just 

424.72 426.48 A: um maybe there isn't many 

426.82 429.03 A: different restaurants in my area that do that
