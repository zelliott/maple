109.30 110.13 A: you know like

112.22 112.75 B: right 

115.08 117.55 A: you kind of feel like you are 

117.91 120.71 A: k- a little taken advantage of you know and 

121.36 123.51 A: i don't know i'm not how do you feel about it 

122.73 126.50 B: family some time in may i'm scared to death already of it 

126.85 127.40 B: um 

127.51 132.19 B: i don't like flying to begin with it's just gotten worse as i've gotten older 

130.42 131.00 A: right 

132.29 136.22 B: um but i have had occasions to um pick up 

136.77 142.34 B: um visitors f- from different places for my family i had a cousin come in from um 

140.25 140.95 A: right 

142.83 144.74 B: from canada uh this summer 

145.11 149.07 B: and so i picked her up at the airport and took her back and she is m- middle eastern 

149.71 150.35 B: um 

150.90 157.24 B: and she didn't have to go through you know i mean she all they had was those little (( tabs )) that they kind of um 

157.50 159.81 B: wiped across the top of the suitcases 

160.78 164.15 B: to see if there was you know any any kind of explosives in there 

164.66 167.22 B: um and she would bring um 

167.52 170.75 B: fingernail clippers every time so every time they would make her send those back 

168.41 168.88 A: right 

171.41 179.75 B: and she told me she would you know get off a plane if she saw somebody else you know that was kind of middle eastern even though she is which i thought was kind of interesting 

172.52 174.93 A: right 

180.45 185.26 B: um do you find yourself looking around the plane to see what kind of people are on when you've 

185.81 186.68 B: flown or 

187.78 188.58 A: right 

194.03 196.93 A: no no you know i 

200.14 200.61 B: right 

203.89 204.54 B: really 

207.12 208.09 A: the middle east and 

208.23 212.00 A: you know just all different types of people so i never ever look around me 

211.80 212.30 B: really 

218.35 219.94 A: i don't you know i don't do that 

227.92 228.17 B: r- 

228.65 229.71 B: oh 

230.94 233.64 B: well i've (( )) oh i bet 

233.99 234.85 B: oh i bet 

241.95 242.55 B: right 

243.54 244.00 B: right 

245.22 250.96 A: you know are very typical just like john or janes or something in our society that is 

245.76 246.38 B: right 

251.09 256.01 A: you know not uncommon for like an osama and when everyone 

256.26 258.27 A: stopped what they were doing and 

256.70 257.31 B: right 

258.60 258.91 A: just 

259.32 264.39 A: turned around and you know was looking at the person that was saying that over the p._a. so 

264.81 265.52 A: um 

266.10 267.95 A: i don't know i mean as far 

268.85 276.14 A: as far as like the idea of the heightened security do i feel safer or anything like that i don't know i mean i think that 

277.05 286.30 A: i think when it first occurred i thought okay well why wasn't it like this before i mean why did something of this magnitude have to happen for us to take notice 

278.20 279.71 B: right exactly 

286.72 287.54 A: and 

288.25 296.18 A: you know for us to take notice and just you know our ears stand up and be like huh you know like what is going on here why don't we just have this heightened security i 

292.53 293.05 B: right 

295.58 296.52 B: right 

296.47 298.67 A: i don't know that i really 

298.89 303.71 A: a- agree or disagree i'm kind of indifferent since i don't travel as much 

304.66 312.46 A: but i get very pissed off whenever i will you know when i do have to fly and 

310.47 312.23 B: so you are more interested in 

312.48 316.96 B: how (( of this )) you are more interested in in the inconvenience maybe that causes 

312.63 314.69 A: you know i have to go through such a 

314.80 315.98 A: time to 

316.27 320.63 A: uh get to my gate 

317.40 320.06 B: you not thinking that maybe it is it's helpful 

320.29 320.76 B: as it 

321.10 323.08 B: kind of portrays so kind of looks 

323.38 324.61 B: better than what it really is 

330.59 331.35 A: yeah i 

330.93 331.91 B: right right 

331.64 332.90 A: i think 

332.65 333.60 B: well that makes sense 

333.29 336.88 A: i think that i don't know if it is as helpful as it 

337.56 339.94 A: as it should be i don't know i 

338.82 339.23 B: right 

340.92 341.52 A: i think 

342.42 344.80 A: i think it turns out to be more of a hindrance 

345.27 348.36 A: for a lot of people and i think that 

348.78 353.64 A: with you know with our government i think that we should definitely be focused more on 

353.96 354.99 A: you know events 

356.24 359.30 A: that you know i don't know i i don't think that our airports 

359.77 360.32 A: need 

360.52 364.01 A: and it seems like the security is getting more and more hei- heightened 

364.56 368.07 A: um because i mean i know down here at hartfield 

368.76 369.32 A: um 

370.04 374.02 A: recently it's like okay now you have to get to your gate 

371.75 372.53 B: right 

374.59 375.73 B: right yeah 

375.59 378.02 A: now we have to get to our gates you know 

378.16 386.34 A: two hours before time and to me i'm like really that that is just sitting there 

382.40 382.68 B: hm 

386.56 387.79 A: and um 

388.17 388.92 B: (( hike )) 

388.52 394.32 A: i don't know i overall for me the whole heightened security is to 

389.97 391.72 B: more than anything wow 

392.70 393.04 B: that 

394.72 396.05 A: i think is just 

397.67 398.22 A: yeah 

398.52 399.21 A: definite- 

400.79 401.76 A: definitely 

400.83 409.21 B: you know that we couldn't go back in the gate area with her and that was through the colorado springs airport and my town is too small you know to have much traffic here 

407.86 408.58 A: mhm 

409.75 412.20 B: um and colorado springs is about an hour away 

412.62 416.46 B: but my mom was born and raised in beirut lebanon 

416.55 419.39 B: so i also understand what you are saying about 

419.50 422.15 B: you know all the different countries and not paying attention to it 

422.63 429.49 B: and you know i was kind of upset i think when all of it started happening because you know there's a lot of people from different countries in here that 

429.97 431.36 B: you know support the u._s. 

431.53 437.46 B: and really you know i mean they they were citizens my mom ironically told everybody she was from germany 

440.12 440.60 A: right 

453.78 454.17 B: um 

454.27 458.69 B: ironically today i almost went to the airport just now um i had a uh 

455.64 456.24 A: right 

459.14 459.89 B: a dog 

460.17 466.99 B: um shipped in i purchased a dog from missouri it that's arriving to the airport in colorado springs today 

467.49 470.68 B: and i sent my roommate up um to get the dog 

480.86 484.24 B: (( force )) it's going to be you know i'm i'm sure she'll have some tales 

484.09 485.33 A: right 

484.66 485.72 B: to tell i wonder if it 

486.23 487.14 A: right 

487.15 491.45 B: you think it is going to increase with all this war do you think it is going to be harder to 

492.06 495.19 B: to fly or or more scary or i mean 

492.93 493.29 A: (( )) 

496.03 496.59 B: what do you 

502.61 503.69 B: yeah 

504.12 505.85 A: i think that 

506.11 506.73 A: um 

507.50 509.42 A: with the impending 

509.59 510.81 A: situation 

511.00 514.01 A: you know that is going on i think that 

512.03 512.74 B: really 

514.98 516.29 A: i think that um 

517.24 519.94 A: it it will definitely become more heightened 

520.55 524.54 A: i think because especially with all the stuff that is going on 

524.64 527.04 A: you know and and how people are very very 

527.22 527.76 A: um 

528.16 528.65 B: wow 

528.28 533.34 A: pretty scared with everything that is going on and i think that the security
