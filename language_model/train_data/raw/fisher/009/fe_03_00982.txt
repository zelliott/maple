0.36 2.40 B: hi my name is melia 

1.90 3.70 A: hi i'm carrie 

3.43 4.60 B: hi carrie 

4.21 5.36 A: how are you 

4.94 6.31 B: good thanks 

7.18 9.31 A: [noise] no she's not that's not it 

9.86 11.88 A: so our topic is 

12.23 13.81 B: (( ah bioterrorism )) 

13.55 14.92 A: yeah what do you think 

14.31 17.10 B: what do we think the government can do to prevent this 

16.65 17.62 A: yes 

17.11 21.39 B: the whole thing is absolutely so frightening to me that [sigh] i mean 

21.67 23.01 B: do you have children 

22.81 23.88 A: yes i do 

23.45 26.62 B: yeah so you're probably feeling the same way 

26.28 27.36 A: oh yeah 

27.11 37.60 B: it's just i mean it's [sigh] i was talking to my husband the other day about it and i said you know living in the united states of america we've never really had to deal with this kind of thing 

38.23 47.35 B: so as far as what i think the government can do about it [sigh] obviously i think there's probably a lot we can do i think our borders need to be tighter 

47.05 48.33 A: (( so do i )) 

48.07 53.59 B: i think that to me is you know i mean i think just about anything and anybody has been able to get through our borders 

53.82 59.98 B: and even since september eleventh i don't think that we've probably tightened them as much as we should 

60.66 62.06 A: no we haven't 

61.84 64.87 B: so i don't know what else comes to mind 

66.98 67.83 A: yeah 

67.84 70.50 A: just like you the whole thing is just so 

70.57 73.45 A: scary you almost want to dig a hole in the ground and 

72.30 73.22 B: yeah 

73.65 77.53 A: put your whole family down there you know [laughter] 

74.74 78.89 B: exactly i know i know absolutely 

78.13 86.59 A: 'cause you know they're talking about everybody's out buying you know air masks and you know get duct tape and and plastic wrap your house 

84.21 85.42 B: i know 

86.05 87.82 B: i know i know 

87.24 88.81 A: you know i don't 

88.72 89.75 B: (( i know )) 

90.02 91.88 B: i mean it's 

92.38 106.50 B: i don't know if you look at it from of the government's standpoint i guess making people aware is very important um but it seems like it's almost a borderline you know where you're pushing the button a little bit to where you're almost pushing people into a panic 

106.32 107.52 A: right 

106.95 114.55 B: so i know for myself i haven't gone out and purchased duct tape or any of that we always keep extra water in the house 

114.40 125.42 B: simply because we live in california and there's always the threat of earthquake [laughter] but other than that i you know i mean we have a little emergency kit and that's about it 

118.97 120.35 A: [laughter] 

124.90 126.22 A: yeah 

126.20 129.16 B: but i don't know what else do you think the government could do 

128.65 137.66 A: i don't know we have enough milit people in the military that they should be able to guard our borders you know 

137.11 146.95 B: yeah i agree with that and the other thing is what about all the other i mean we have agencies c._i._a. everything that you could imagine you know all these secret service agencies 

147.06 153.38 B: and i think one of the biggest problems and why september eleventh was even possible was that they don't communicate 

152.69 154.01 A: mhm 

153.81 166.54 B: you know they're all looking out for themselves and rather than have open lines of communication and supporting each other they're basically looking at what they can do to you know to get promotions and whatever it is 

165.83 170.41 A: right because you know with the september eleventh thing somebody had to have heard something 

170.02 173.14 B: absolutely no doubt absolutely 

171.07 172.12 A: you know 

173.27 180.79 A: so i mean you would think if something like the bioterrorism what happened somebody would have to hear something before it happened 

180.27 187.03 B: well i think now they're being a little bit they're a lot actually they're probably a lot more aware of the kind of conversations that they're intercepting 

187.27 191.76 B: and i think that has to do with you know how the alert went up recently to an orange 

191.46 192.71 A: mhm 

192.05 198.79 B: um and i think that had to do with them overhearing some of the secret service agencies overhearing conversations 

198.65 202.78 A: which can make you even more nervous when a terror alert goes up 

200.30 202.02 B: (( i know i know )) 

202.18 203.46 B: i know oh i know 

203.20 204.91 A: and nobody knows why 

204.43 208.74 B: nobody knows why and what do you do keep your children home what do you do 

205.24 206.36 A: [laughter] 

208.55 209.99 A: how old are your children 

209.56 222.13 B: my children are too old to keep home my youngest one has just turned eighteen and she's getting ready to she's been looking at east coast colleges and she's getting ready to actually go spend a week at n._y._u. 

211.75 213.24 A: [laughter] 

222.19 223.49 A: (( ooh )) 

222.59 225.34 B: and i'm in a major panic over here 

224.85 226.65 A: yeah i probably would be too 

225.94 228.59 B: yeah i don't want to let her go and then my older daughter 

228.98 232.90 B: she goes to school locally college locally she just turned twenty 

232.95 242.53 B: but she likes to pretty much stay close to home when she's finished she's heading down to san diego state so she wants to stick close to home the other one wants to travel the world [laughter] 

232.97 233.99 A: (( oh )) 

241.52 243.34 A: yeah 

242.72 248.44 B: and i want her to but it's just everything is so uncertain right now 

248.16 250.95 A: yeah you kind of want them all close by 

249.83 252.46 B: what else do you think the government can do 

252.64 253.68 A: um 

253.61 259.75 B: besides tightening the borders having the agencies work you know more interactively together do 

260.73 263.17 B: you think there's anything else that can be done 

263.22 271.01 A: my only opinion you know i ask my husband all the time why we just don't go over there and bomb their whole country and get rid of it you know [laughter] 

268.89 269.80 B: i know 

270.24 272.54 B: i know it's called politics 

272.02 275.05 A: i know but you know it would just make things so much easier 

273.66 278.25 B: yeah well now you know we don't have a hundred per cent support thanks to france 

277.76 278.88 A: yes 

278.43 282.04 B: they've decided that they are not going to be in our corner so 

283.35 291.89 B: yeah i don't know i'd like to think that we can go in there and do what we need to do with iraq and that will put this all to rest but 

291.91 294.28 B: i think it's probably bigger than that 

294.27 297.78 A: yeah because you know we have the guys over there looking at all their 

298.46 299.49 A: um 

299.34 302.40 B: the u._n. security yeah right 

300.48 304.64 A: yeah and you know there's millions of stuff they're not seeing 

304.12 306.96 B: of course they're only seeing what 

307.11 309.77 B: saddam hussein wants them to see yeah 

309.18 310.19 A: right 

310.59 314.40 A: yeah there's stuff all over the place there they're not seeing so 

311.96 313.16 B: i know 

313.58 314.71 B: yeah 

315.65 318.33 B: but as far as bioterrorism i mean 

318.70 321.27 B: gosh i just i mean look at all the 

320.17 322.11 A: the thought of it it's 

321.49 333.13 B: i know and look at all of the think of all the tankers that come in and from foreign countries foreign lands you know with all of our the imports that we have everything that comes into our ports 

333.26 338.40 B: that's always scary too i mean something could come off of a port and have a bomb on it 

338.35 341.56 A: oh yeah oh yeah 

339.35 342.77 B: so i don't know it's just ugh 

342.92 345.08 A: it's almost too much to 

345.40 346.67 A: grasp 

346.65 351.03 B: really and i think part of it is that we've never really had to deal with this before 

350.99 359.02 B: we've had the luxury of living in the u._s._a. and the u._s._a. never had to deal with those kinds of things i mean we used to look at other countries 

358.86 366.28 B: with terrorist attacks buses that were you know bombed and things like that and go oh my gosh they are uncivil 

365.92 369.12 A: could you imagine living like that and now here we are 

367.44 368.24 B: (( no )) 

368.59 369.86 B: and here we are right 

369.84 377.11 A: here we are and you know we don't know whether the bioterrorism would come from you know it could come from korea 

376.56 377.95 B: oh absolutely 

377.57 378.70 A: yeah 

378.11 385.54 B: absolutely i think one of the things that's really scary is you know like nerve gas and some of that stuff that they've been talking about 

386.04 392.68 B: and then what do you do if they go to a code red you know i mean what do you do sit in front of your television 

388.84 390.62 A: [laughter] 

392.43 393.45 A: right 

393.35 396.38 B: ah i mean jeez louise 

394.17 395.26 A: i know 

396.75 397.80 B: i don't know 

397.88 398.90 B: i 

400.21 409.46 B: you know it's always in my mind now unfortunately it's always in the back of my mind i'm always watching things that may look suspicious and i guess that's good um 

409.32 412.02 A: yeah it's just that you never thought you would have to live that way 

411.44 412.78 B: no really 

412.50 413.45 A: (( you know )) 

412.68 422.86 B: and i'm really sick of the news i put the news on for a few minutes and it's like it's the same old thing you know just the same old thing pictures of saddam hussein pictures of president bush and 

417.36 418.55 A: oh yeah 

422.71 428.65 B: maybe united you know nations security council and are we moving towards war or away from it 

428.86 430.35 B: (( it's just i don't )) 

430.58 434.25 B: know i think part of it is you feel somewhat helpless 

434.33 435.71 A: yeah 

435.30 440.76 B: you really do because your you know your future is in the hands of others 

441.30 442.70 B: so [sigh] 

441.42 443.46 A: and there's nothing you can do about it 

442.86 453.22 B: yeah i really do think though that tightening the borders is one thing and also looking at the people i mean we have so many people in our country illegally 

452.71 454.04 A: oh i know 

453.65 461.61 B: and this whole thing about i just learned the other day that someone could actually an illegal alien could actually commit a crime in our country 

461.98 466.06 B: go to goal and the i._n._s. is not informed 

467.32 468.42 A: (( oh )) 

468.23 470.23 B: i thought that was very interesting 

469.56 471.20 A: yeah i didn't know that either 

470.59 473.83 B: no there's some yeah so 

474.62 483.92 B: there's just i think there's so much you know they walk a fine line with this whole you know with our whole doctrine being what it is the land of the free 

483.98 491.55 B: but people that i don't know i just feel that people that come in here from another country and haven't earned that right 

491.98 493.08 A: right 

492.51 494.01 B: don't deserve it 

493.63 498.61 A: well i mean even right now even with all of the security tightened just about anybody can get in here 

498.01 504.76 B: yes absolutely i mean we live very close to the san diego border that which is you know close to tijuana 

504.94 517.36 B: and we have border patrols throughout this that area coming through and even as far as about thirty five forty miles inland but a lot of times we'll come back through and they'll be closed 

518.35 519.13 A: hm 

518.71 529.26 B: and i know that they work together with the other border you know the other border patrol checks so some are open and some are closed but nonetheless i don't know i just can't help but think that 

521.99 522.99 A: right 

529.22 534.34 B: you know the only way those terrorists got in our got in an aeroplane was because we let them in our country 

533.91 541.11 A: that's right and i live i live in florida and you know it scares me to death because we're like hanging off here our little state 

539.40 540.46 B: (( mhm )) 

540.79 541.91 B: mhm 

541.34 545.77 A: by ourselves and it's pretty much get rid of our whole state with 

542.25 544.43 B: (( yes i know [laughter] )) 

545.16 546.49 B: i know 

546.11 547.21 A: (( you know )) 

546.75 549.18 B: yeah i know 

549.06 552.29 A: so you know i really don't know 

549.98 550.91 B: yeah 

552.32 558.29 A: and with all the brains the power they have in the government you'd think they would have already figured it out 

558.54 561.26 A: you know of of what they could do 

561.19 566.45 B: yeah and you ask yourself is it just the red tape that it that is preventing 

566.68 575.32 B: you know them from taking quicker action is it kind of like running a big corporation where you can't turn on a dime is that basically what's involved here 

575.38 586.34 B: you know that they don't have the freedom i thought this whole homeland security thing was supposed to free up one government agency so that they could make decisions you know very quickly 

584.31 585.75 A: right and only 

585.82 587.07 A: do that 

587.04 588.13 B: so 

588.73 594.94 B: i don't know other than tightening up the borders and really paying close attention to who's already in the country 

594.36 595.44 A: [laughter] 

595.65 599.89 B: i mean it's like maybe they need to do some sort of spontaneous
