198.05 206.11 A: um i don't know how you would how you would get about celebrating that because there's so much hatred in the world um especially in the united states still um 

203.13 204.23 B: yeah there sure is 

206.92 215.12 A: yeah that would be rea- hard that would be a real fantasy cause i don't you know it might be accomplished in the u._s. but i don't think it would be a worldwide 

210.05 211.60 B: yeah 

215.40 218.76 A: holiday that you could celebrate because there's too much 

217.82 218.26 B: yep 

218.96 226.59 A: for for years and you know as long as the earth's been in existence i imagine there's been some type of hatred somewhere for everyone else so 

224.82 225.36 B: right 

226.24 228.15 B: that's right how about you 

227.33 227.77 A: yeah 

228.61 233.85 A: hm that's a hard one i'm not sure i'll um

239.45 239.89 B: (( )) 

241.04 241.45 B: ok

304.70 305.57 A: self 

305.82 308.86 A: they're too centered on themselves and not centered on

490.28 490.59 B: and 

490.69 501.63 B: families and elderly people i mean it's just it's really interesting to see that in a society where you know we view to be very different from ours and and 

503.35 505.86 B: don't i don't always agree with their culture but 

506.11 506.60 B: um 

507.08 508.85 A: no family will imitate (( )) 

508.93 511.02 A: limiting the family size is 

511.13 515.85 A: (( )) something i wouldn't necessarily agree with and i guess it's more china than japan 

515.43 515.79 B: yeah 

515.90 517.24 B: yeah 

516.85 522.54 A: yeah after i said that i realized that but we did have a ge- grandparents day because i know i've seen
