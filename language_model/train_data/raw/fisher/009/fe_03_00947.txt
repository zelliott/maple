372.83 387.57 A: you know it's but they've it's been so commercialized and and i think people just have the wrong concept of it like you know you can give gifts all year round to show somebody that you love them and it's just not about going out you know 'cause you know there's a going out and buying what you can buy 

375.40 376.32 B: (( in ))

485.61 500.35 A: she's small ah going out and buying for her but you know just the little things that you can do for kids outside this country and and knowing that you can bring some happiness and some brightness in their lives you know so i y- you know if we could do away with christmas in terms of the commercialism 

500.42 502.16 A: i'd be all for it 

501.78 503.72 B: i i totally agree 

503.06 509.94 A: i'd be all for it but you know otherwise ah i i don't know what other holiday i could come up with that would probably could could replace it
