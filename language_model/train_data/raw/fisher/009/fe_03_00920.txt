15.55 15.90 A: uh-huh 

17.95 19.13 B: um 

26.04 27.74 B: (( )) can be pretty um 

29.71 30.68 B: outstanding i guess 

32.53 33.39 B: believe we shouldn't 

33.53 34.54 B: go to war at all 

34.74 35.32 A: yes 

35.46 35.81 A: uh-huh 

38.86 42.27 B: it's wrong that and we're in right now a country people are 

43.74 44.60 B: telling us we can't 

44.77 45.81 B: protest against it 

47.69 48.49 B: and i'm not 

48.70 51.19 B: i don't think we should go to war at all with iraq 

51.59 52.55 A: yes uh-huh 

52.57 53.10 B: you agree 

53.45 59.15 A: what do you think about the the threat he the saddam hussein is to the world 

59.19 60.85 B: well i understand that i mean 

59.43 60.17 A: he's 

61.96 65.44 B: i believe that should've been taken care of a long time ago i mean that i mean 

66.81 69.02 B: i just don't think war is the answer though 

69.22 69.75 A: uh-huh 

71.92 73.56 A: so we shouldn't go mhm 

73.17 75.87 B: no i don't well why should any people die 

76.04 80.69 B: why should innocent people be killed young men and women be killed in a war on both sides 

81.12 82.09 A: yes mhm 

81.63 83.65 B: and that's wrong that is wrong i mean what 

83.41 83.99 A: yeah 

83.82 86.04 B: the world is (( )) what these people are (( )) 

87.08 88.39 B: they are not the ones that are going to be killed 

88.97 91.12 B: it's the innocent people that are going to be dying children 

91.40 91.82 A: yeah 

92.26 93.03 B: and that is wrong 

92.86 93.44 A: that is true 

93.80 97.44 A: well i i i share your opinion on it and i also think that 

98.19 101.53 A: um we shouldn't go in there and just um 

103.72 104.45 A: and kill 

105.65 106.13 A: uh um 

106.67 106.95 A: b- 

107.15 112.89 A: because what what will happen is if we go in there it looks like we'll be sure to to anything 

113.42 113.99 A: um 

114.24 116.85 A: which happened before in the same region 

117.07 120.49 A: and they don't have the the type of force which can 

121.22 126.29 A: uh you know stand-up to to american uh military uh force or 

126.66 127.70 B: exactly 

127.97 129.87 A: so they would just be there you know and 

130.35 130.86 A: um 

148.32 155.81 A: and they can do nothing and so the the casualties from uh the on the american side will be um 

157.07 158.96 A: you know very very small 

159.08 159.88 B: yeah yeah 

159.16 160.45 A: where where 

160.82 164.88 A: the casualties on the iraqi side will be very high and and it's 

165.01 167.81 A: it's sad that this type of war involves 

167.93 169.36 A: many um 

169.62 170.49 A: civilians 

170.61 172.20 B: exactly i agree with that 

170.62 172.02 A: so like 

172.40 173.51 A: unlike um 

174.52 176.90 A: you know previous uh centuries 

177.06 178.68 A: war now involves 

178.77 189.59 A: mostly and it seems to be usually usually killing civilians and not military people before it was someone died in the war it was a knight or a soldier 

189.73 190.29 B: mhm 

189.86 191.22 A: now it seems to be 

192.52 200.77 B: it is a waste i mean to kill innocent people there is no r- there is no reason no reason to kill people who shouldn't be killed i mean children they have their whole lives to live and 

194.37 196.03 A: it absolutely uh-huh 

197.63 198.21 A: yeah 

201.52 202.34 B: that is wrong and 

202.40 203.01 A: yeah 

202.79 205.36 B: and we and and and and the u._s. they send 

205.65 207.80 B: they have to we send our children 

207.92 212.53 B: um i have a son you know i don't want to send him and he is only a child but what if there's wars when he is older 

212.65 213.46 A: yes 

213.15 218.83 B: i mean i'm i'm thinking of him i mean he is my only child i mean but what if another mother has a child that is going to war i mean 

214.56 215.01 A: yes 

219.01 220.04 B: not just in the u._s. 

219.03 219.68 A: mhm 

220.41 221.77 B: anywhere else it's it's 

220.49 220.78 A: mhm 

223.05 224.96 B: you can't kill killing is wrong 

224.72 226.00 A: mhm how old is your son 

226.15 226.67 B: four 

227.22 227.79 A: okay 

227.79 230.65 B: no he's got awhile but still you've got to think of the future 

229.15 230.11 A: no 

231.03 232.22 A: that is true that is true 

231.63 233.68 B: you've got to think of the future i keep thinking i mean 

233.93 234.29 A: mhm 

234.47 236.51 B: i mean i'd rather i'd rather go than him 

236.95 238.12 B: because i've had my life 

238.59 239.04 A: yeah 

239.03 240.74 B: and he hasn't so i mean i don't 

241.10 242.18 B: killing is wrong 

242.03 242.64 A: uh-huh 

242.88 243.70 A: yeah 

243.82 253.85 A: and i i happen to be i'm i'm not american so i sort of speak from a a different perspective -cause i'm polish i was born in poland and 

247.09 247.66 B: okay 

253.47 254.57 B: okay 

254.32 254.78 A: um 

255.32 261.59 A: but i i am here i've been here for awhile so this is (( new )) and i also read a lot of things from um 

261.93 271.03 A: uh you know like um newspapers from poland and and people in poland unfortunately they think that americans all want war you know because there is 

269.92 270.40 B: yes 

270.76 272.79 B: they do they think that they all think we're we're

274.12 276.47 A: well you know maybe it's sort of 

275.03 275.52 B: wants 

276.58 282.24 A: sort of to someone who doesn't know the reality over here that they have is sort of uh shallow 

282.93 291.18 A: understanding of what america is about but i i from what you say i believe that a majority of the americans don't want to go to war 

290.52 291.23 B: no they don't 

291.34 293.92 B: and then when we say we don't we want peace 

291.44 291.78 A: they just 

294.23 294.61 A: mhm
