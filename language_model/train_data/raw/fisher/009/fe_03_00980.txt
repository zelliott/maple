14.39 18.45 A: oh okay i haven't either but we're supposed to talk about bioterrorism 

17.89 21.76 B: yeah about what we can do to prevent a bioterrorism attack i think yeah 

20.74 23.59 A: yeah i really don't know much about other than the fact that like 

23.86 27.76 A: something will come out and then air by breeze the air and that's all really i know about it 

27.37 30.77 B: mhm yeah and the and the i think it's um 

32.45 37.21 B: i guess i guess they've been doing a lot and that that's when they had that warning about duck taping or 

37.71 43.26 A: yeah duck taping you're ah doors and window with plastic stuff and um 

37.91 40.34 B: you're home and windows and things 

42.05 42.45 B: mhm 

43.60 46.73 A: and wearing masks or something i don't really understand it really 

50.13 56.45 B: i remember the the hardware stores were out of duck tape i didn't go out and buy any duck tape but apparently a lot of people did um 

53.78 54.25 A: mhm 

55.45 55.85 A: mhm 

56.73 61.24 A: i know i say something on court t._v. sometime one time where um that had happened it was at an um 

61.68 67.82 A: it was kind of weird some people had put some and ah bacteria on a salad bar or something 

67.99 68.38 B: mhm 

68.34 71.52 A: and everybody that had a salad that day got violently ill 

71.76 74.93 B: oh like e. coli or something like that i think i heard about that 

72.19 72.97 A: and that was 

73.37 74.50 A: yeah it was kind of 

74.80 78.40 A: a bioterrorism ah for food or something 

78.23 78.78 B: mhm 

78.70 82.36 A: and ah it was really evil and people put stuff on this salad 

82.76 87.10 A: at the salad bar and every body got sick and people were close to dying and everything 

87.22 88.38 A: and so um 

88.39 88.87 B: oh wow 

88.52 93.14 A: that's the only thing i know about bioterrorism thinking about food and the air 

93.01 93.42 B: mhm 

93.27 95.87 A: i don't know it's just really it's very evil 

96.11 97.58 B: yeah i guess it could be water too 

97.81 98.86 A: oh it could be water 

97.81 99.65 B: um like water water supplies 

99.86 101.26 A: hm i didn't know that 

100.03 103.32 B: ah reservoirs things like that i guess they're targets 

102.27 102.95 A: hm 

103.87 105.03 A: how would they do the water 

105.07 111.71 B: i don't know i i don't know whether that's ever been done in in history but i guess that's something they can imagine happening with enough of 

111.17 111.62 A: mhm 

112.05 114.84 B: enough poison or something like that they probably could 

113.54 114.89 A: yeah 

115.26 119.81 A: that's really sad well we certainly are spending a lot of money on defense to do all of this 

118.80 119.26 B: yeah 

120.29 124.59 B: yeah it it it seems like that would be really expensive defending against these things because it's um 

123.67 124.12 A: mhm 

126.03 129.87 B: it i don't don't rea- it it it seems very easy for 

129.99 134.72 B: if just a few people to do something like this and ah it would be very expensive stopping 

135.48 137.04 B: something so easy i guess 

137.27 142.05 A: so then you would have monitor the water that you drink and monitor the food that you eat 

140.18 140.61 B: mhm 

142.61 146.28 A: and how how do you monitor the air that you breath and stuff like that 

146.38 149.74 B: yeah i don't know if if they going if we're going to start seeing 

149.97 157.95 B: like like they have the the detect like smoke detectors and the and the c._o._t._w._o. and all that i wonder if we'll start seeing like anthrax detectors and 

158.09 161.23 B: ah i don't know what other kind of gases they use cyanide gas or 

158.22 158.83 A: mhm 

161.50 161.95 B: i don't know 

161.74 163.81 A: i know what what is wrong with the world 

164.60 168.16 A: everybody is just getting to be so so mean about everything 

168.30 175.66 B: yeah there's there's so many so many bad things out there that we can use to to hurt people with instead of weapons and bombs it just 

173.29 173.94 A: i know 

174.89 175.85 A: it's so sad 

176.93 178.75 A: how how our country got like this 

178.81 179.25 B: mhm 

179.36 179.94 A: you know 

180.84 181.62 A: what can you do 

182.34 184.91 B: yeah yeah i i guess i don't know if there's anything we can do about it 

184.99 185.55 A: mhm 

184.99 189.46 B: i know i'm not doing anything about it now at at least i hope that i i don't ever have too 

189.64 190.12 A: mhm 

189.85 192.11 B: yeah 

190.29 191.42 A: so you live in michigan 

192.10 192.52 A: mhm 

193.35 194.43 B: yeah it it it's not 

194.75 197.62 B: eh people here don't seem seem to be to worried about it 

197.74 200.38 A: oh see in atlanta everybody's worried about it 

200.30 203.43 B: mhm yeah the east coast cities yeah 

201.19 203.82 A: ah like in taller buildings they um are always 

203.98 213.75 A: you know i went to this um downtown office building one time and they have these codes out they say today is an orange code alert or whatever and they are making us more aware of it 

211.61 212.02 B: mhm 

213.85 214.50 B: oh wow 

214.51 220.81 A: yeah it's everywhere you go and then people get scared to work in taller buildings now here because it's you know 

219.24 219.66 B: mhm 

221.36 226.68 A: downtown and midtown have a lot of tall buildings and security is much more ah beefed up now 

223.19 223.93 B: yeah 

226.56 227.00 B: mhm 

227.51 230.72 A: so it's just it's kind of pain but it's a necessary pain 

231.22 233.16 B: yeah i guess i guess you guys would be worried i mean 

233.30 235.07 B: you'd be on the east coast and i guess 

235.33 237.46 B: that was were the olympic park bombing was 

237.50 238.57 A: right mhm 

237.67 243.08 B: right i guess that you've seen more of that then the midwest doesn't seem all that concerned we're not 

242.50 242.92 A: mhm 

243.19 246.85 B: i i i work in detroit and there's really people don't seem 

247.51 252.37 B: to be that concerned about it but i used to look in in new york city before nine eleven i'm not really sure 

250.12 250.56 A: mhm 

252.73 257.14 B: how people are responding there but i'm guessing that they are taking it a lot more seriously there than we are 

255.88 256.43 A: yeah 

256.62 257.53 A: that's so said 

258.49 258.98 A: so 

259.02 259.56 B: yeah 

259.39 263.17 A: do they tell us when our time is up or do we are we suppose to monitor this or what 

262.78 267.27 B: i think i think i think it's just fifteen minutes is that how much it's suppose to be 

266.68 269.00 A: oh i i heard ten but 

268.42 273.20 B: oh maybe it's ten minutes i i think i think they'll tell us when we're done i think we're suppose to keep talking until 

269.49 269.94 A: mhm 

271.58 272.21 A: oh okay 

272.83 275.73 A: okay all right bioterrorism um 

277.04 278.33 A: i don't really know 

278.50 280.40 A: i know my cousin is the army 

280.53 280.91 B: mhm 

280.90 283.88 A: and he is all into you know all these things they had to do 

284.57 286.54 A: it sounded kind of crazy they had to ah 

287.15 289.77 A: ingest all this stuff and make themselves sick and 

290.21 293.39 A: see how they reacted and take all these shots and everything 

293.02 296.11 B: oh they had to actually oh like like the um 

297.65 300.39 A: he's in the um army he's stationed somewhere in arizona 

300.40 300.80 B: mhm 

301.22 304.99 A: and they had to ah do all this crazy stuff you know he went to um 

305.91 307.40 A: what do you call that oh west point 

307.53 307.92 B: mhm 

308.17 312.08 A: and then now he's you know he knows a lot about the defense and all of this 

313.19 316.45 A: i don't know we are just spending too much money on this thing 

316.26 320.93 B: yeah eh all all of these smallpox um 

321.15 326.30 B: inoculations and all of that it's very expensive to do all of this and and to to manufacture all the an- anthrax vaccine very 

322.66 323.06 A: mhm 

326.95 330.00 A: really yeah i was thinking about getting a small pox vaccine 

327.36 328.06 B: things like that 

329.86 334.25 B: yeah i i think it makes you sick for a little while though that's the only problem with it 

334.11 335.55 A: oh it does i didn't know that 

335.47 337.16 B: yeah it it it that for i mean 

337.31 343.92 B: for some people it can be very dangerous um i definitely i don't think they recommend most just people doing it and and i i think ah 

338.89 339.39 A: mhm 

341.74 342.22 A: mhm 

345.34 346.66 B: for the most part they 

346.91 352.46 B: they just want like government workers ah to to have it just because they're they're in more harms way i guess 

352.48 352.92 A: mhm 

353.10 353.62 B: um 

353.85 355.43 B: but the- i guess it can make you really sick 

355.95 356.33 A: um 

356.10 365.80 B: um most people get a little ill like like after you get a flu shot or something you get a little ill ah um i think the same thing happened with smallpox but some people could really have some bad reactions to it 

366.88 367.42 B: (( )) 

367.66 367.99 B: yeah 

368.93 370.57 A: yeah i don't know why these um 

370.92 374.84 A: iraqis and kuwaitis people hate americans 

374.82 375.92 B: mhm 

375.66 378.30 A: i mean i just don't understand what we've ever done to them 

378.64 379.79 B: yeah what what yeah 

378.79 381.02 A: to make them want to hate us and kill us and all this 

381.10 383.77 B: and and give us small pox yeah they're they're pretty 

382.78 383.22 A: yeah 

385.72 386.13 A: mhm 

387.76 388.24 A: mhm 

388.62 389.15 B: um 

389.33 391.73 B: like to just give regular people small pox like this then 

391.83 392.34 A: mhm 

391.89 392.28 B: which 

392.60 393.74 B: i mean it's a horrible way to 

394.19 398.24 A: oh all over the news all you ever hear about is how much money we're spending on the defense 

398.46 398.88 B: mhm 

398.80 403.08 A: and it's just and we need to be spending more money on the economy and getting because i'm 

403.49 409.12 A: i have been laid off and i need i i'm mean i'm i'm of course worried about terrorism and everything but at the same time 

404.93 405.58 B: mhm 

409.61 411.61 A: i'm worried about how i'm going to pay my bills 

411.78 412.20 B: mhm 

412.23 412.70 A: you know 

412.87 416.83 B: yeah yeah i i think that's a bigger deal right now for most people i think 

415.75 416.22 A: mhm 

417.56 418.98 B: yeah yeah my my families 

419.12 423.40 B: er- er- er- er pretty much on the edge of being laid off and everything er- er- er- and everyday it's 

423.79 424.61 B: more and more 

425.11 429.34 B: that seems to be a bigger deal then then bioterrorism at the moment 

426.60 427.06 A: mhm 

429.10 433.23 A: yeah i mean we have to worry about bioterrorism and terrorist attacks i realize that 

431.46 432.68 B: mhm 

433.58 435.68 A: but at the same time you know 

436.39 442.01 A: i mean somebody in my apartment just got evicted the other day i mean that's really sad you know all her stuff was thrown out 

440.17 441.04 B: that is sad 

442.03 443.00 B: that's horrible 

442.76 444.99 A: on the street i mean how sad is that 

443.65 444.50 B: mhm 

446.25 447.77 B: yeah that's that's that's really sad 

447.83 448.26 A: mhm 

448.32 455.87 B: oh i i i'm surprised that they can't use the two i mean we have this problem with the the terrorism and and some how create a lot make a lot of jobs out of 

456.12 458.38 A: i know that's a great idea 

456.42 468.19 B: and and use it to to to we need a lot people to manufacture the vaccine we need people to do to all the security and we need people to do things but for some reason it's not i don't know i don't know it's not making enough jobs or 

467.81 471.66 A: i know there's more internet security jobs now then there use to be 

470.71 471.11 B: mhm 

471.96 472.42 B: okay 

472.80 477.70 A: um because i used to work in the internet for an internet company and um 

478.31 482.41 A: you know hackers and stuff like that they seem to be more internet security jobs 

482.36 482.74 B: mhm 

483.12 485.10 A: and there seem to be more medical jobs 

485.58 486.47 B: yeah that's true 

486.00 487.50 A: because you're right we need more ah 

488.17 489.84 A: terrorism jobs or something 

489.91 490.31 B: mhm 

490.43 490.87 A: yeah 

490.98 492.97 B: yeah it it seems to be like the i mean 

493.09 497.44 B: we need people to to make all these things that we're going to use against them like what if 

497.66 498.31 B: all these 

499.20 499.88 B: um 

500.63 502.08 B: to make the vaccines and 

502.40 505.49 A: you mean like a terrorist f._b._i. agent or something like 

505.66 510.99 B: yeah i i guess that would be a lot of jobs too well well we need like like these people security personal 

511.19 511.69 A: mhm 

511.54 518.40 B: all over the place i i guess they have had probably a lot more security in airports so that has probably created a lot more of those kinds of jobs 

515.86 516.31 A: mhm 

518.75 523.80 A: well basically it would just be security guards for um the luggage and stuff right 

524.27 528.30 B: yeah i think so i i don't really fly very often i don't know if i've really seen very much 

525.47 525.79 A: hm 

529.23 536.97 B: seen a lot more people and detroit airport has hasn't had a good reputation about about complying to these new regulations 

533.28 533.60 A: hm 

535.94 542.04 A: ah i know in the atlanta airport they're advising us to get down there like three hours ahead of ah our flight time 

541.88 542.52 B: oh wow 

542.47 543.99 A: yeah it's just way to much 

544.29 553.74 B: yeah detroit was not like that yet i guess in some way it's it's kind of i kind of wish it was like that because that means at least it means they're they're probably doing their job 

545.72 546.18 A: yeah 

548.89 549.38 A: mhm 

554.11 555.24 B: go through since 

554.95 556.60 A: yeah and then you know um 

556.88 560.65 A: they won't let you take cars up to the curb anymore or they wouldn't for awhile 

561.00 563.84 B: oh okay yeah some airports are letting you do that now 

561.58 562.66 A: because of terrorism 

563.81 567.50 A: yeah so it's just you know it's just a lot more hassle 

567.71 568.15 B: mhm 

568.15 568.89 A: to do that 

570.28 570.84 A: so 

571.02 577.88 B: yeah i guess i've i if i felt there's a big threat i wouldn't mind doing it sometimes i'm like i don't know how big the threat is 

574.98 575.45 A: mhm 

577.83 578.44 A: right 

578.25 581.79 B: i don't know if i'm really i don't think we're taking the must of a risk by flying on a plane 

582.11 584.77 B: i think it's i think i think it's pretty safe 

584.43 587.49 A: yeah well everybody else would argue differently 

587.57 588.06 B: yeah 

598.88 599.32 A: mhm
