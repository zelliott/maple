26.22 28.90 B: different shows and then tried to mimic what they saw 

29.85 30.49 B: and um 

30.66 35.29 B: one of them um was about a month ago that the boy had um 

36.60 44.99 B: thought that he could uh stand at the top of a parking garage that was three stories tall and jump off into a a snow bank 

45.95 50.16 B: and thought that the snow bank would break his fall but instead it broke his back 

50.22 50.73 A: mhm 

51.31 53.73 B: and um another incident were 

53.93 56.20 B: um another boy um 

56.34 59.45 B: had gotten a b._m._x. bicycle for christmas 

68.69 75.11 B: landed off a um down a hill and landed into a lake lost the bike but um 

75.25 79.33 B: luckily survived after crashing through the ice 

80.80 92.69 B: but i don't know i think for adults um you know some of the shows like the um you know like the caught on video and police chases that kind of thing 

92.37 92.81 A: mhm 

92.78 95.16 B: um i think they're kind of um 

95.30 98.38 B: once you get into 'em sometimes they can be kind of addicting 

99.31 101.31 B: compared to made up stories 

102.90 105.59 A: yeah there's that certain aspect of it i think that 

106.25 107.40 A: this really happened 

108.94 109.21 A: like 

109.64 111.40 A: like you say when someone gets hurt 

111.64 114.47 A: on the reality shows they really got hurt it's not someone 

115.83 119.34 A: that's just being an actor and you know they walk off the set after the scene's over 

120.03 120.76 A: i think that's 

120.94 121.47 A: the way that 

122.08 123.43 A: people get interested in 'em 

124.43 124.97 A: that uh 

124.48 126.22 B: do you watch a lot of that uh 

126.45 127.09 A: no i don't 

128.08 128.55 A: um 

130.78 132.68 A: most reality shows are pretty stupid my so 

132.59 133.01 B: yeah 

133.60 134.06 A: uh 

133.69 133.98 B: yeah 

135.53 138.13 A: goes back to lowest common denominator thing 

139.14 139.90 B: right 

141.94 142.50 A: survivor 

143.21 143.73 A: they're making

146.49 148.08 B: um 

148.21 151.78 B: more like um crime investigation or court t._v. or 

151.95 152.86 B: sci fi or 

153.32 155.02 A: yeah i watch a lot of news stuff 

157.68 158.60 A: n._y._p._d. blue 

158.93 159.29 B: mhm 

160.26 160.94 B: oh yeah 

160.70 160.95 A: or 

161.26 161.69 A: there's a 

162.64 165.19 A: there's a reality aspect to it that it's not 

167.79 169.73 A: it's a little different since it's you know 

170.07 170.89 A: artistic 

171.32 172.40 B: right 

172.22 173.98 A: the acting is artistic and the writing 

175.11 175.36 A: not 

175.75 178.89 B: more logical and more educated and 

177.90 178.37 A: yeah 

179.00 179.60 B: yeah 

179.06 181.41 A: not some moron robbing a convenience store 

181.55 182.67 A: and is caught on a hidden 

183.58 192.25 B: oh i know some of that stuff is just amazing (( )) you know like why why would anyone think they can get away with whatever it is they're doing or 

192.37 198.97 B: or um you know how could they think that they were going to pull something like that off or you know especially the ones where they're just 

199.17 200.47 B: you know 

200.57 203.05 B: taking their life in their hands it just 

203.32 206.50 B: it i i don't know i don't know what gets into people or what they're thinking 

207.52 208.03 A: yeah 

208.54 209.93 A: i think that's another part of it that 

210.64 213.20 A: when they have the world's dumbest criminals or whatever on t._v. 

214.33 216.05 A: people watch it and say ha ha ha 

216.78 219.26 A: at least i'm not that dumb or you know 

218.29 221.39 B: did you see like a month ago when they had the i guess it was 

221.70 223.32 B: three weeks a month ago when 

223.47 226.79 B: when that m- uh man had hijacked the uh 

227.00 228.93 B: the postal worker down in miami 

229.18 229.75 A: yeah

236.13 241.51 B: of all people a postal worker you know in in one of those vans that can't go over like thirty 

241.29 243.04 A: right 

243.28 244.78 A: maybe he wanted to drop the mail off 

256.75 257.17 A: well 

257.66 261.33 A: he wanted his fifteen minutes of fame i guess and you know he was on c._n._n. and 

262.00 263.17 A: m._s._n._b._c. and 

263.31 264.67 A: fox news and all that so 

265.19 267.46 B: oh so you think it's sensationalism 

268.42 269.53 A: yeah i think so where 

269.84 271.71 A: all these shows are making stars out of 

272.50 273.63 A: normal people

286.26 287.94 A: all these talk shows and 

293.80 294.49 A: oh yeah 

293.94 298.39 B: and if the person will do it they'll they'll you know pay them like five thousand dollars to 

298.53 299.29 B: you know just to 

299.93 307.83 B: perform this crazy act on t._v. and usually it you know it includes just things that are gruesome and like 

307.26 308.67 A: yeah they have shows where 

309.18 310.92 A: they go for money and you have to like eat

332.40 333.56 A: yeah that 

334.25 334.84 A: that's uh 

335.42 336.42 A: not your loss there

345.38 346.96 B: since that's basically my um 

347.20 349.22 B: my point of business so 

356.44 366.15 B: you know we have a a satellite so we get like a hundred and fifty stations but uh other than when news break comes on and c._n._n. or something i really don't get 

360.24 360.67 A: oh yeah 

366.28 368.02 B: to pay much attention to it 

369.59 370.16 B: so

418.04 418.47 A: yeah 

418.46 428.08 B: did you know that that from what i understand the reason why this uh university is doing this study is so that they can develop better software
