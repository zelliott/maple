0.44 2.07 B: hi my name is jay 

1.84 4.20 A: hi ah my name is lynn 

4.79 7.61 B: (( hi lynn ah yeah [lipsmack] well )) 

7.68 9.53 B: my opinion on the um 

10.57 18.24 B: [noise] um inspectors in iraq is that um i just got to finish listening to the presidential address and i kinda agree with him that 

20.11 25.16 B: [noise] the um inspectors if if saddam really wants to disarm he would 

26.02 38.90 B: take the inspectors and take all his weapons or whatever he has and then in a parking lot and just destroy everything right there in front of them but he hasn't done that and it's taken them twelve years just to disarm 

39.65 40.88 A: (( [noise] right )) 

42.34 43.69 A: that is true 

44.06 47.81 A: as far as you know that he should have already done it before 

47.91 49.22 A: but um 

49.69 54.29 A: [mn] i don't know i i i guess i'm just so nervous about the whole thing that i 

55.21 63.09 A: [cough] i hope that the arms inspectors certainly know what they're doing i mean i i'd really hope that they do and assuming that they do 

63.74 64.58 A: um 

65.06 67.51 A: i don't know what do you think do you think that they 

67.64 71.72 A: ah actually know what they're doing and that he's not getting away with 

71.48 72.77 B: well 

72.34 73.90 A: some kinda deceiving 

74.15 78.20 B: [lipsmack] i think saddam's dece- um deceiving them by 

78.21 89.10 B: moving um his weapons around you know when the inspectors supposed to be at this place you know they move stuff the- the- they move the stuff to a diff- you know they just moving it all around to you know 

84.25 85.18 A: right 

89.15 92.34 B: play the cat and mouse game with the inspectors 

91.75 92.80 A: right 

92.79 94.95 B: um and then you know 

95.91 110.60 B: and you know everything that i'm saying i'm going off what the president is telling me so you know who's to say if that's the truth but he's also said president bush i'm talking about he's also said that um the scientists have been bugged so when they interview these scientists you know they don't say anything 

101.93 103.43 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

110.82 114.77 B: ah you know against saddam 'cause they'll be killed or their families will be killed 

114.80 116.10 A: right 

116.70 119.21 A: yeah i know what you mean i um 

120.20 129.85 A: [lipsmack] i know i mean i- i- it's like ah you gotta read all the papers and and like you we watch the the president listen to him speak watch all the news and i just wonder 

130.29 132.62 A: how much of it it is 

133.21 136.97 A: is for is truth and how much of it is just 

137.01 138.05 A: um 

138.17 150.34 A: stuff that they've fabricated to make it look better or i i don't know i mean it's so hard to pick and choose i guess and like you say he's our president and i guess we're supposed to believe what he says is true 

150.58 152.60 A: and i certainly hope so but 

151.96 162.52 B: well i hope they're sharing the intelligence that they so call have that they're not telling us with the inspectors you know and i- if that's true then why haven't the inspectors been able to 

156.55 157.90 A: [mn] yeah 

158.12 159.57 A: (( mm [mn] the next day )) 

162.62 166.93 B: you know go into these so called places that the united states knows 

166.94 178.09 B: where these biological weapons are why haven't they just gone straight directly to those places and maybe they have gone to those places and like i said earlier you know saddam's playing the cat and mouse game and he's you know 

178.08 182.39 B: moving the weapons out of the pl- the places where the united states you know 

182.46 185.90 B: know they're they're there that one day but yo- 

186.12 187.32 A: (( they're in a different place )) 

186.83 189.19 B: (( you know right )) 

188.56 199.80 A: yeah i know well there was that incident too where apparently before all this started to happen there was a cargo ship or whatever some type of uh ship like that that that was seen leaving 

199.89 213.26 A: the country or that area of the country and so the ports have been you know like what was on it do you remember that yeah that that's kind of it's kind of scary because you know a lot of people can certainly suffer but ah 

204.19 205.67 B: yeah i remember that 

206.15 207.55 B: yep 

214.01 216.18 A: yeah i don't know [sigh] um

249.23 251.59 A: you know supposedly gonna do here 

251.71 256.33 A: and it just makes a rift between all the other countries so it all kind of snowballs down or 

256.35 260.87 A: around all the other countries and the whole world i mean it's [noise] 

261.11 262.40 A: a terrible thing

318.17 325.53 A: [lipsmack] that um saddam hussein would just like leave the country you know and go into exile or something to save his hide but ah 

324.25 327.87 B: i don't even see that happening [laughter] 

326.11 332.00 A: yeah right wouldn't that have been great but then on the other hand i we would never have found him probably
