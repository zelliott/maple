200.31 207.51 B: yeah basketball's cool too um i mean i'm playing men's sports mostly like tennis basketball table tennis 

202.42 203.23 A: yeah 

206.06 207.16 A: yeah 

207.89 215.88 A: and probably my my favorite thing to watch is like the figure skating you know all that ice stuff 

208.03 209.12 B: but there are 

216.18 217.86 A: that they have you know 

217.87 218.82 A: um

233.84 234.56 B: (( cool )) 

235.86 245.20 A: that kind of professional sport but part of the reason i like watching that is 'cause there's no way i could do it myself [laughter] hav- have you ever done any 

242.88 243.73 B: (( cool )) 

243.92 249.39 B: and and and the cowboys are washington right or uh 

247.94 249.89 A: uh they're in dallas texas 

249.88 250.66 B: (( duh )) 

251.45 252.73 B: almost got it 

252.69 253.76 A: [laughter] 

253.18 254.97 B: [laughter] 

254.32 256.04 A: (( where do you live )) 

255.82 257.57 B: i'm michigan detroit 

257.46 259.31 A: oh in michigan okay 

258.84 260.73 B: (( so you live in texas too huh )) 

260.46 263.84 A: well i live in arkansas now i was raised in texas 

264.07 268.63 A: but arkansas is right here by texas so [laughter] i guess once you 

267.55 271.11 B: then why they don't have a good team [laughter] 

270.40 274.27 A: uh well we don't have a professional team we got uh 

274.12 286.02 A: the state team is the razorbacks which you know i mean i that would be who i would wanna watch but they're not a professional team we we have a i think we have a semi pro team 

286.54 299.33 A: but i don't i don't remember even what they're the twisters or something like that but i've never gone to see them [laughter] and i guess when you're raised in texas everybody knows about the dallas cowboys so 

299.41 304.41 B: okay so the only reason i didn't know that because i told you like i don't watch that much sport 

304.17 306.24 A: [laughter] that you don't know yeah 

304.70 308.67 B: and mostly i i mostly like to play it myself instead of watching 

308.83 313.20 A: so if you're not watching i mean you would rather be playing than watching huh 

312.51 315.61 B: yeah i would rather be playing instead of just watching 

315.78 319.01 A: do you ever bet on any of it that you watch 

318.52 324.66 B: uh i don't really i believe just once or twice i'm not into uh 

324.89 327.99 B: (( the uh stadium i bet for )) 

328.15 336.83 A: yeah i've never i've never done anything like that now you all have one in detroit you all have uh a big stadium

355.76 358.77 A: [noise] you haven't been but it is big isn't it 

358.64 365.39 B: yeah that's right well mostly it's like the red wings we got in detroit they're good at hockey so most people it's like 

365.59 367.25 B: prefer watching them 

367.53 370.57 A: [noise] prefer watching the hockey do they have a 

369.38 370.52 B: (( yeah hockey )) 

370.91 374.58 A: do they have a professional [noise] uh hockey team in detroit [noise] 

373.75 379.61 B: oh yeah oh yeah they won uh the big at least four times they won the uh the american champ yeah four 

379.00 382.01 A: oh oh okay now which one is that 

380.42 381.40 B: they're good 

382.37 385.87 B: the red wings they call them the detroit red red wings 

385.67 396.28 A: the red wings okay okay i thought there was something there but hockey seems like it's awfully they they really get after each other [laughter] 

395.13 397.28 B: (( well yeah there's a lot of fighting )) 

396.93 408.94 A: yeah they a lot of them don't have their teeth or anything any more you know [laughter] i can remember watching somethings about that you know they'll how they get with those sticks a whole lot so 

409.66 414.68 A: i can imagine well i guess that you're used to the cold weather that's why hockey's a big sport 

413.56 418.59 B: oh yeah i suppose with crazy weather in michigan it's like one day it's raining another snowing 

418.66 422.72 B: one day thunderstorm blah blah [laughter] tornados [laughter] 

421.08 422.19 A: yeah 

423.01 424.03 B: (( it's crazy )) 

423.07 424.22 A: yeah i'm 

424.37 429.48 A: and uh i guess hockey can be done inside or outside is that 

429.14 430.91 B: that's right 

430.13 431.55 A: but they have 

431.57 434.66 A: hockey games when it's like warm or 

435.00 437.57 B: i don't think so mostly it's like 

438.01 439.28 A: not really 

438.68 441.15 B: uh yeah because i don't even it's like 

442.38 444.46 B: to the stadium there or 

444.60 447.20 B: mostly just like watching it on t._v. 

448.33 450.35 A: it's easier to do that 

449.95 451.94 B: yeah and cheaper too 

451.98 454.86 A: [laughter] yeah how much is that 

452.19 453.91 B: [laughter] 

455.89 462.60 B: well on t._v. it's most of the time they show it for free but uh if you go to the stadium it depends on the seat you sit in 

456.12 457.02 A: (( is it ex- )) 

459.45 460.31 A: yeah 

464.67 468.41 A: but if it's a pro team or something it's pretty expensive isn't it 

467.84 472.77 B: (( that's right well and as i say it's like to depend on the seat all those things )) 

473.56 476.21 B: the front or the back or the middle 

476.69 478.84 B: (( all that is more cost to go )) 

476.84 477.92 A: mhm 

479.12 482.54 B: good view when you get a good view you've gotta pay more 

482.23 486.69 A: [noise] yeah i would think so well i know in uh 

486.96 487.87 A: in 

488.00 489.31 A: dallas 

489.76 491.62 A: i have gone to 

491.68 493.92 A: something there and we were 

494.04 501.51 A: we had watched one game that week in dallas and so we were gonna watch the cowboys play on t._v. 

501.69 503.73 A: instead of going to the game 

503.95 508.92 A: and because they didn't sell out the stadium we had to drive like 

509.10 513.02 A: [noise] fifty miles out of town to watch it on television 

512.87 513.96 B: wow 

513.87 514.94 A: because they 

514.46 516.84 B: fifty miles [laughter] 

516.21 522.51 A: because they hadn't sold out so does that does it work like that in detroit if they don't sell out that they make you all go somewhere else [laughter] 

522.19 523.56 B: oh that's rough 

523.57 527.61 A: [laughter] they've never let they've never made you do that 

528.24 531.01 B: (( no i don't remember i i'm not sure ))

531.72 532.44 B: (( no )) 

534.73 541.41 A: you know that if you lived in town there that you could still get the signal but you couldn't watch it on t._v. 

541.87 544.36 A: if they didn't sell out tickets so 

544.74 556.25 B: well i mean most of times like it's just there on t._v. i don't watch all the time but most of the time i do it's like every time they put it on the t._v. there i'm not sure 

549.15 550.03 A: uh-huh 

555.09 555.94 A: uh-huh
