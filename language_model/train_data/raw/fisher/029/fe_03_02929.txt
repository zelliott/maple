177.55 178.80 A: [laughter] sure 

178.34 179.97 B: that's even worse 

179.50 181.91 A: [laughter] well 

180.95 184.51 B: i don't even i don't even pay any attention to it any more 

184.18 189.66 A: yeah i'm located uh i'm located in south dakota so i'm quite close to minnesota 

189.17 190.11 B: (( oh )) 

189.49 200.45 A: and i lived in minnesota for about uh thirty thirty five years so i i kinda follow them but again it's still the same old thing if they're if they're winning that's fine if they're not uh i 

199.62 201.02 B: (( turn it off )) 

200.37 207.02 A: i used to have some people that would get up and leave a meeting so they could go watch a football i i'm not that avid a fan you 

206.34 207.85 B: right 

207.23 216.01 A: know if the if i'm there that's fine and i'll watch it and i'll cheer 'em on but hey you know my life or death does not hang on whether they win or lose 

215.78 216.90 B: right

220.58 221.70 B: ohio 

221.26 224.18 A: ohio yeah i kinda figured that probably was the case 

224.65 230.08 A: so no i'm just you know i'm kinda a lukewarm sports fan but 

232.09 235.75 B: well you don't have too many sports there in north dakota do you 

235.35 237.44 A: in south dakota oh 

236.52 238.17 B: (( south dakota )) 

237.75 239.66 A: no i'm in south dakota 

239.24 240.44 B: yeah 

239.84 248.88 A: yeah well you know i mean we have we have our our baseball team the sioux falls canaries and then we have

256.71 257.64 A: (( yeah )) 

258.76 270.59 A: yeah and then of course you know like we were talking about there we have the high school sports and so on but we don't have any we don't have a truly professional team you know in in here we're not big enough to do that 

265.16 266.35 B: major 

267.09 268.21 B: right 

270.04 272.18 B: yeah 

272.26 275.15 B: you take up on the minnesota twins at all 

275.11 283.63 A: a little yeah and i'm i'm again i'm not with all of these i'm not a real avid fan but i watch a little and i'm always intrigued when they win 

276.21 277.29 B: yeah 

283.46 284.54 B: yeah 

283.81 291.54 A: you know and and follow 'em a little bit that way but again it's it's not that big a deal if they win or lose i obviously i want 'em to win [laughter] 

291.38 295.39 B: well actually i guess i'm into sports quite a bit 

294.88 296.01 A: are you really 

295.63 298.70 B: yeah i am quite into sports 

298.65 302.44 A: well that's that's good a lot of people are and a lot of people enjoy it 

301.50 305.37 B: but i don't like to watch all those games 

305.34 307.27 A: well so what do you do 

306.13 308.02 B: it makes me too nervous 

307.77 311.37 A: you listen on the radio then or you just listen to the scores or what 

310.75 312.85 B: i i watch the scores 

312.21 319.49 A: yeah yeah well see i i was not ever able to play any sports 

319.58 329.76 A: so i just had to pick up on on what i liked and what i disliked you know and didn't care that much about but i i was not an active participant in any sport so 

323.77 324.99 B: yeah 

326.18 327.37 B: yeah 

329.51 331.01 B: yeah 

334.57 342.83 A: so you know i don't know we're we're talking what does anybody know exactly what we're doing here or they're they're monitoring what we're talking about or what 

342.25 346.35 B: right just uh watching professional watching sports 

345.64 350.41 A: sure sure i suppose it's interesting and they in turn can draw some comments on it 

349.46 351.93 B: do you watch e._s._p._n. and all 

351.95 361.09 A: uh yes and uh when i do that i i wa- i like to watch um when they have e._s._p._n. i like some of these strong men contests 

360.93 362.12 B: oh do you 

361.74 363.38 A: oh yeah 

362.62 365.81 B: i've seen some of those they're very interesting 

365.22 367.98 A: i really i really feel for some of those guys 

368.25 371.88 A: i wouldn't wanna i wouldn't wanna strain my body quite that hard 

368.45 369.65 B: oh yeah 

371.49 373.18 B: right 

372.60 376.50 A: i don't care what kind of shape they're in i still think damn that's too 

375.65 379.11 B: well i think professional wrestling would be worse than that 

378.10 379.06 A: (( oh )) 

379.32 389.70 A: but professional y- you're right but professional wrestling from from my standpoint is such a a great deal of showmanship and uh acting and more 

388.88 393.25 B: well i don't have you seen some of that stuff that's for real 

393.15 394.42 A: well 

393.81 398.10 B: they've shown some of what they do they're act- that's actual a lot of them now 

397.68 400.27 A: well i i guess 

400.57 403.73 A: i'm not as positive of that as some people are 

404.32 406.42 A: i i i you know 

405.62 412.03 B: maybe the winner is already determined but all that stuff that is showmanship that goes on 

411.95 413.18 A: but you know 

412.22 416.13 B: the beating up of the head and body and everything 

415.53 424.21 A: i'm i'm not sure how you can take steel chair and hit somebody over the back of the head and you draw a little bit of blood the crack should kill 'em you know if 

423.39 426.60 B: well it's a lead they are heavy steel chairs 

426.24 433.44 A: yeah well but you know you come out and they throw you against the they throw you against the steel railing of the ring 

433.18 434.63 B: yeah 

434.01 437.07 A: i don't know about that uh 

437.13 447.41 A: you know particular if you get some vulnerable part of the body and you are i don't care what kind of shape those guys are in by george you hit that you hit your back on the sharp edge of that ring 

438.30 439.85 B: probably padded 

447.90 452.85 A: i think you're gonna do some damage particularly when the guy's that doing it is three hundred four hundred pounds 

452.57 454.61 B: right 

455.86 457.01 A: and you fly 

456.06 459.49 B: i just wouldn't wanna watch it it's just too gory for me 

458.42 459.28 A: yeah 

459.32 460.11 A: (( nah )) 

460.34 466.19 A: it just again it doesn't appeal to me i'm not that kind of a person where you take somebody 

464.39 467.19 B: right i'm not a violent person neither 

466.49 472.58 A: no you take somebody that's down like that and you begin to kick 'em and hit 'em and that's not for me 

472.02 473.62 B: not for me either 

473.18 474.76 A: (( no you betcha )) 

474.92 480.49 B: well i'm pretty much i'm into three sports that would be football baseball and basketball 

479.88 481.87 A: (( oh yeah were you like that at high school )) 

482.90 485.46 B: well i was basketball in school 

484.92 488.77 A: oh yeah mhm mhm what position did you play 

487.27 487.98 B: (( so )) 

489.15 490.38 B: guard 

490.02 494.35 A: oh yeah oh yeah was your team was the team pretty good 

494.35 496.39 B: no [laughter] 

495.04 495.83 A: oh 

496.53 497.99 A: well [laughter] 

498.10 508.23 A: that kind reminds me of one time a guy said you know our basketball team you know really he said they're not too bad they can't run they can't shoot and they can't uh they can't pass but other than that they're a great team 

507.63 508.93 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

508.66 514.75 A: [laughter] so so when does this conversation end by the way 

513.91 518.38 B: after ten minutes i guess our ten minutes are about up 

515.17 516.05 A: oh for 

517.78 525.36 A: it is it isn't that you i don't like talking to you i'm just saying hey you know this seems to be going on for quite a period of time if i were 

524.41 525.95 B: but uh 

526.15 531.98 B: i i don't like i'm i i can see that chicago's quite a sports town 

531.37 532.62 A: yeah 

532.22 537.81 B: uh seeing it in the chicago cubs is that too far away for you 

537.88 541.90 A: well that's uh quite a few hours away yeah mhm 

541.02 543.17 B: do you get them on television 

542.56 545.06 A: oh sure we get 'em on w._g._m. 

544.48 546.63 B: but you like the twins 

546.26 554.36 A: yeah yeah i take twins because uh they're close enough that if i wanna jump in the car i can run up there we're only a couple of hundred miles away from them 

553.79 557.15 B: oh i see and then chicago is how far away 

556.62 560.72 A: oh chicago would probably be about uh six hours seven hours 

560.55 562.23 B: oh that's too far 

561.63 574.85 A: yeah yeah and then you get there and fight the traffic and nah i'm not that i'm not that interested and when you're that far away too you don't really build any kind of uh allegiance to the team members uh you know 

566.02 567.48 B: nah right 

574.35 578.75 B: well that's a big part is building allegiance to various teams 

578.14 579.92 A: you bet you bet 

579.02 584.82 B: then you'll watch 'em i think they're televising the reds games a hundred times this year 

584.87 594.70 A: yeah and you know if you're if you're an avid sports fan and you sit in front of that t._v. you you develop almost a personal relationship with those players you know 

594.46 597.08 B: i like to watch a good game 

596.97 599.89 A: well my grandkids are are great with statistics
