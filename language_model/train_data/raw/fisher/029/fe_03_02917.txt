484.74 488.97 A: (( and i don't like watch that on t._v. but like i like to bowl you know )) 

485.17 486.02 B: yeah

535.14 536.49 B: going like the

553.19 554.50 B: yeah 

553.91 562.01 A: even even like people who don't watch it can talk about how they don't watch it and which ones they do actually watch and which ones are interesting you know
