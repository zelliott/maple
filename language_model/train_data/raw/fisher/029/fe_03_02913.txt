76.73 80.32 A: yeah you you guys are loving it out there [laughter] you know 

79.06 84.21 B: yeah well you know it's it's the the city hasn't been that hot on uh 

84.40 92.30 B: uh of of late or up until this past year because well the baseball the the the phillies are starting to do well 

91.75 92.99 A: mhm 

92.21 102.36 B: we got a lot of uh a lot of relatively you know name players have come in suddenly and then the uh the eagles had a fairly good season last year 

102.31 106.90 A: [noise] yeah they did actually [laughter] i thought i thought they'd get a lot further than they did [laughter] 

106.70 112.63 B: yeah well you know what it is you can never never count on beating that team that you beat all the time 

112.55 117.31 A: [noise] isn't that it uh [laughter] it's like a curse if you beat 'em twice you're not going to beat them in the playoffs 

116.93 119.24 B: yeah yeah really 

117.36 119.32 A: (( [laughter] )) 

119.48 131.69 A: yeah so it was it was a good year for philly i'm i'm out here in california i grew up uh kinda like in a bunch of different teams but i'm definitely a lakers fan so [laughter] i'm going to watch the game here in a little while 

129.70 130.76 B: (( oh )) 

131.73 140.08 B: yeah well i i gotta i gotta i gotta feeling that uh well if we get if we get past uh detroit let's see then then 

141.24 148.00 B: yeah then then we'll have one more series on on this coast and then [sigh] then we'll probably wind up having to play you guys 

147.69 153.49 A: [laughter] looks that way unless uh sacramento can pull it out [noise] they're a real tough team this year [noise] [noise] 

153.10 158.90 B: yeah yeah well you know it's something something about uh uh well 

159.04 168.41 B: i just don't i don't i don't like kobe and shaq and obviously they they they they are they have the talent to carry off their attitude so 

161.98 164.02 A: [laughter] 

167.54 174.55 A: exactly yeah yeah i mean you know you gotta you gotta love the the ability that they can play at and everything but yeah as far as 

174.53 183.80 A: you know egotistical type people [laughter] they're two of the top [laughter] so yeah and and they don't work well together really i mean on the court they do but 

178.54 179.62 B: really 

183.93 191.73 A: even then they they still complain a lot and you you can see that without without shaq the team wouldn't would go nowhere with kobe 

186.45 187.79 B: [laughter] 

191.69 192.85 B: oh yeah 

192.12 197.46 A: with a regular size big man in there so i think that that partially he resents that you know [laughter] 

194.18 195.28 B: really 'cause 

196.58 199.83 B: 'cause he seems like he's a he's a me me me guy 

199.18 208.90 A: mhm he's definitely a he's the me guy and and you know he he's supposed to be the future of the team but at the same time you're like well shaq'll be here for 

208.83 214.89 A: maybe three more seasons and then he's going to retire i mean he's got a lot of injuries so i don't expect him to stay around too much longer 

214.71 215.61 B: yeah 

214.91 217.51 A: and then by then it'll be kobe's team but 

217.59 222.61 A: you know [laughter] whether they're going to get somebody in there that you know can complement him you know we'll have to see 

221.70 225.28 B: well you know maybe maybe maybe they'll make a trade for yo 

225.15 229.76 A: yeah yo [laughter] that that'd definitely be good 

226.25 227.67 B: [laughter] 

228.58 233.67 B: that that that has to got to be one of the uh the the greatest ads that uh 

233.86 235.65 B: that i have ever seen 

235.56 239.58 A: oh yeah i i just thought you know where do they come up with this stuff [laughter] because 

239.67 250.57 A: this year i would say out of all the years before we've had some of the best sports commercials [laughter] i i don't i don't know what it is they just finally started making good ones now or what [laughter] but [noise] 

249.53 261.61 B: yeah i i don't know i i i think you're right i don't i don't know who is who is coming up with them specifically but uh but you see that well here in here in philly yo is a greeting 

261.29 266.91 A: [noise] oh yeah that's true [laughter] mostly on the east coast actually yeah [laughter] 

263.35 265.72 B: you know so so if i can i mean 

266.04 271.03 B: everybody's walking yo what's happening you know like that and then to have it be on there 

271.05 279.43 B: uh it's it's even more funny and then then that that follow up when yogi bear walks in and he's like yo no yogi yeah 

273.06 274.57 A: (( [noise] [noise] [laughter] )) 

276.33 286.20 A: [noise] [laughter] yeah that's hilarious [laughter] [laughter] yeah i thought that's really good [laughter] but you'd think somebody in new york would probably know who yogi was 

286.15 291.30 B: yeah really but then again she those those all those people were kinda young 

286.93 289.31 A: [laughter] 

290.92 298.92 A: [noise] yeah that's true that's very true [laughter] they're very young [laughter] and most girls don't follow sports like that [laughter] 

297.69 298.88 B: that's true 

299.49 302.93 A: yeah so um so yeah i guess you'll be watching wrestling tonight then uh 

303.05 308.45 B: oh yeah well i'm i'm kind of uh i got it on mute [laughter] 

306.51 311.45 A: mhm oh i see that's right i keep forgetting you got it on early timeframe so 

311.10 312.28 B: yeah 

311.67 313.67 A: you get it at a whole different time than we do 

313.42 314.75 B: yeah 

314.29 328.49 A: yeah so makes it tough for you starts out here at nine o'clock so [laughter] by the time we're you know watching it it's primed and ready to go [laughter] like it's uh i watch i i mainly watch mondays but it's kinda tough to get on the thursdays 

328.15 331.60 B: oh for the uh smackdown 

328.63 329.41 A: so 

330.08 331.14 A: for the raw 

331.24 341.24 A: smackdown yeah smackdown yeah so [mn] um yeah but but i i enjoy it you know i've been watching it get a bunch of people over here and have a few beers it's good good to go 

341.68 354.12 B: yeah well like like you say that is that kind of shifts more shifts more towards entertainment than than sport although um what's his name kurt kurt angle would like us to think that uh 

353.86 354.77 A: yeah 

354.07 361.45 B: he is he is uh the greatest athlete that ever ever lived and we we should never forget that he got two olympic gold medals 

360.59 366.04 A: [laughter] yeah well and that's the thing it's like yeah sure brock lesnar was great in college too but 

366.03 378.05 A: now you know most of it's the talking [laughter] they banter back and forth so much that the actual wrestling time is very little [laughter] [laughter] but you know [noise] that's the so how do you feel about the rock [noise] 

373.14 374.37 B: that's true 

378.51 381.15 A: one of your favorites or one of your hateds [laughter] 

380.52 383.85 B: uh well you know i i think he should stick with movies now 

383.49 384.89 A: [laughter] 

385.25 391.79 A: i agree i think i think the fan base uh pretty much would agree with you on that too from his the welcome that he gets now 

391.48 394.55 B: did you uh did you happen to watch the kentucky derby 

394.76 403.09 A: you know what i actually did not catch that it was uh you know it was on and i didn't didn't get a chance to actually watch it but uh yeah uh did you guys watch it

402.67 404.88 B: yeah yeah it was it was a 

403.65 407.95 A: (( [noise] hey [noise] yes yes )) 

405.87 412.64 B: it was a great uh i guess at what you'd call an upset because it was uh the first time a uh 

409.54 410.21 A: (( [laughter] )) 

412.83 413.88 A: yeah 

413.26 419.51 B: had won in i think twenty five years and the first time ever a new york trained horse had won 

419.38 430.58 A: really oh wow that's cool yeah you know i i i used to go to the horse races because bay meadows isn't so far from where i'm at uh so it's kinda nice if you get to go there and and see 'em in person but 

430.58 437.17 A: uh i used to try to catch the you know the the top three races and that was about it on tv [laughter] 

436.56 442.87 B: bay meadows so you're in uh oh here we go we're shifting away from the sacks here you're in you're in northern california then
