7.92 8.49 B: (( [noise] )) 

9.63 12.10 B: (( hi danielle [noise] i'm gina )) 

12.51 16.69 B: um i think we're supposed to this is my first call a- 

15.73 17.60 A: yes mine as well [laughter] mhm 

16.92 19.35 B: [laughter] uh 

19.52 23.95 B: the topic is um professional sports on t._v. 

24.12 28.79 B: and at the moment my husband is watching basketball on t._v. 

28.87 33.25 B: um i probably watch um about 

34.48 41.96 B: i would say maybe i usually catch just parts of games i don't think i've ever watched an entire game 

41.92 49.50 B: all the way through and i usually just watch maybe the last few minutes or catch a few minutes here and there 

49.86 51.04 B: um 

51.45 56.07 B: my favorite sport to watch on t._v. is probably football 

56.41 57.61 B: um 

58.44 62.25 B: i have no good reason why it's just the most interesting to me 

60.90 61.46 A: (( [mn] )) 

62.51 63.51 A: okay 

63.50 64.82 B: what about you 

64.70 67.75 A: okay um well i um 

65.28 66.02 B: [laughter] 

67.89 79.65 A: i lately i've been watching a lot of n._b._a. but i would say football is um probably the sport that i watch the most and usually i watch that from uh beginning to end 

80.32 83.85 A: especially during the um the football season i watch that 

83.67 84.85 B: right 

83.92 87.81 A: for football i know i know i know more about football than any other sport [laughter] 

87.67 89.33 B: i think i do too 

89.12 90.20 A: yeah 

90.25 97.15 B: i think i i used to play football with my brothers growing up and i think the fact that there's only 

97.28 103.61 B: like a dozen games or probably maybe there's sixteen games during the season 

103.26 104.24 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

103.87 114.03 B: whereas i mean there are so many basketball games and i think my least favorite sport is baseball because that's pretty much like a sleeping pill 

113.68 122.53 A: [laughter] yeah also yeah baseball i would say ba- well i don't really say baseball i think my least favorite sport would probably be soccer 

114.92 116.08 B: to me 

122.75 124.97 B: [mn] oh you know what i don't th- 

122.97 123.74 A: [laughter] 

123.78 126.57 A: i know absolutely nothing about soccer [laughter] 

126.20 133.37 B: i don't think i've ever watched a soccer professional soccer game on t._v. so i would [laughter] other than 

131.04 132.08 A: right 

132.43 134.89 A: (( soccer is my least [laughter] favorite )) 

134.13 136.18 B: right other than my 

135.20 137.63 A: and this is yeah yeah [noise] 

137.07 138.55 B: that's funny 

138.57 142.15 B: well um let's see as far as um 

142.24 156.69 B: are there any other sports that that you like to watch actually on um [lipsmack] once a year i'll watch tennis on t._v. when it's wimbledon but again if i catch maybe part of a match here and part of a match there 

156.73 165.11 B: that's probably it i just never actually i think get to sit down and watch an entire game in any sport um 

164.33 165.09 A: right 

165.13 167.98 B: from start to finish on t._v. 

167.03 176.37 A: um i would say i'm uh f- my my other favorite sport um and i'll probably say this above above football or right up there with football is ice skating i 

176.41 182.18 A: like to watch ice skating competitions and you know also recreationally i ice skate as well 

181.94 183.02 B: okay 

182.24 187.70 A: so i i really get into the ice skating where there's a yeah yeah 

184.85 186.51 B: i like that too 

187.68 188.66 B: (( but i think )) 

187.70 198.20 A: i i mean and there's usually the the i would say the competition i watch mostly with ice skating is the um either the um uh i like to watch the the female figure skating the singles 

198.30 199.44 B: right 

199.05 200.12 A: yeah 

199.90 202.51 B: that's good i like to watch them also 

202.54 208.00 B: um usually when it's either a championship or probably the olympics 

207.78 208.65 A: yeah 

208.83 212.24 A: yeah i would say the ol- i would say the championship is pretty good 

214.21 215.50 A: so yeah 

215.69 218.91 B: [noise] uh let's see what other sports 

218.96 220.93 B: um [noise] do i watch 

221.15 222.83 B: um i 

222.27 224.17 A: gymnastics is good 

224.35 230.48 B: uh yeah you know and again that's probably another sport that i probably only watch around the olympics 

229.67 231.04 A: [laughter] 

230.46 242.40 B: with ice skating well you know if it comes on the t._v. i i would typically you know keep it on i have um young girls and uh they of course like um figure skating 

242.16 243.14 A: right 

242.61 250.48 B: and so you know if we can catch it that's something but again i i would say if we watched that just a couple of times a year on t._v. 

250.44 253.97 B: that's probably it i think the main one's my husband is a 

253.93 261.65 B: an avid sports fan so we pretty much get uh professional hockey on t._v. uh basketball 

259.46 260.31 A: (( [mn] mm )) 

261.61 274.07 B: um he even he watches baseball also but not that's not his favorite either um so therefore we don't get [laughter] stuck with watching a lot of it on t._v. 

268.06 269.10 A: right 

273.96 274.91 A: right 

274.64 275.67 B: um 

276.50 282.73 B: so um [lipsmack] let's see what else can i tell you or maybe i can ask you um 

283.30 284.54 B: um 

284.63 292.15 B: do you typically watch um professional sports games when you're by yourself or is it more like with someone 

292.26 298.32 A: it's it's both um it's some it's really by myself they're like i mean you know it's just 

298.30 311.50 A: you know just to be watching sports in general not like saying uh you know round you know superbowl time or what have you or you know uh olympics i usually watch it by myself if there's nothing else to watch [mn] 

311.12 312.33 B: really 

311.59 318.93 A: but yeah if if i'm you know over at a friend's house and everybody's watching it then it it's a little more fun for me 

318.69 319.64 B: right 

319.03 320.99 A: to watch it with a group of people 

320.75 321.86 B: right 

321.24 329.11 A: you know to get everybody's reaction and you know everybody has something to say about this [laughter] and you know it's really interesting 

329.21 333.13 A: you know you can it's it's more animated when you're watching with a group of people 

333.37 335.36 B: right i agree 

334.21 334.83 A: yeah 

335.12 336.11 A: yeah 

335.52 340.82 B: i would probably say that if i was by myself i probably would not 

340.84 352.36 B: watch sports on t._v. i i pretty much would you know usually watch it because you know my husband is is watching not that i don't you know wouldn't enjoy it but again 

343.28 343.85 A: (( mm )) 

351.76 352.61 A: right 

352.24 363.56 B: if i was by myself i probably do not think that i would be watching sports uh unless it's figure skating or gymnastics [laughter] such a girl 

360.03 364.62 A: [laughter] yeah yeah yeah 

364.18 367.43 B: um but i do i enjoy um 

367.45 377.89 B: i enjoy watching sports i was kind of athletic growing up and so i played you know nothing dramatic but you know basketball and softball and um 

377.79 385.77 B: and such and and even football you know with like you know in the neighborhood so i do enjoy watching them on t._v. 

381.51 382.52 A: right 

382.87 383.71 A: right 

385.71 395.16 A: yeah i just recently started watching basketball i mean i'm still learning you know the ins and outs about the game and you know um 

395.14 401.01 A: i i've actually started watching it because of you know certain you know basketball players because i like the way they play 

401.04 408.00 A: and it was like okay so all i know is two pointers and three pointers so i'm just getting in to basketball [laughter] 

406.17 408.80 B: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

408.17 411.84 A: i have a lot of friends that that watch basketball pretty often 

411.88 423.36 A: so whenever i'm over at their place you know i i really have no other choice but to look at it [laughter] so uh that's how i pretty much got you know um slightly interested in basketball 

416.80 417.85 B: right 

422.89 424.80 B: [laughter] 

424.05 431.08 A: but i'll i'll go to you know a basketball court and you know play play a little basketball with some friends just for fun 

430.75 431.82 B: right 

431.18 439.09 A: but to sit there and you know actually watch if i if i was by myself and you know i had the choice of a sport it definitely wouldn't be basketball [laughter] 

438.43 440.66 B: right 

439.29 441.53 A: that wouldn't be my first choice at all [laughter] 

441.23 450.05 B: well at least there's more action when you're watching basketball on t._v. especially professional at least there's a lot of scoring going on 

443.77 445.01 A: right 

447.41 448.43 A: mhm 

449.99 450.76 A: yeah 

450.02 457.33 B: i find the opposite with say baseball where when you're just watching baseball um 

457.40 458.54 B: i mean it's 

458.93 466.46 B: there there're so few you know scores it seems in the games i watch anyway and the announcer 

464.66 465.37 A: right 

466.50 475.35 B: that does the baseball games is talks in in such a monotone [laughter] voice that [mn] again it just you know puts me to sleep 

475.24 476.90 A: right right 

475.49 486.73 B: and so whereas in basketball at least and usually when it comes down to the last couple of minutes like i said i usually catch just maybe the last few minutes of a game um 

486.75 494.92 B: if it's close you know i- it's really fun to watch when it's close because it literally could go either way 

491.21 492.13 A: right 

494.87 496.15 A: exactly 

495.05 497.66 B: um yeah so um 

497.87 503.56 B: [lipsmack] let's see [laughter] i can't believe i talked this long about professional sports 

503.02 506.07 A: [mn] [laughter] how long are we supposed to talk about it again 

505.41 508.39 B: uh ten minutes as far as i know 

507.93 508.79 A: (( okay okay )) 

508.65 511.02 B: and like i said this is my first time 

510.90 515.45 A: yeah mine too [laughter] um i'm trying to think another sport um 

515.67 517.01 A: that's um 

517.17 522.63 A: pretty interesting is um volleyball 'cause i played it in you know when i was in high school and everything 

522.38 524.85 B: i don't know that i've ever watched 

525.02 529.70 B: professional volleyball on t._v. i don't think ever 

528.71 533.25 A: i've watched it maybe i can count on one hand how many times i've watched it 

533.29 540.26 A: and um i mean i've yeah they they've actually i think it's an olympic sport as well something some olympic 

533.49 534.05 B: (( [mn] )) 

534.50 535.23 B: i 

538.85 545.13 B: i was just going to say i might have caught it at the olympics possibly like the summer olympics 

542.26 544.15 A: mhm yeah 

545.23 547.26 B: or something of that nature 

547.21 548.12 A: yeah 

547.28 548.35 B: um 

548.45 552.67 B: i mean really honestly the when the olympics are on 

552.84 556.72 B: i probably watch sports constantly on t._v. 

556.99 565.66 B: um they're not technically professional but i mean that's something where i would definitely turn on the t._v. even if i was alone 

565.87 567.30 B: and watch 

567.41 572.10 B: you know whatever event uh even the speed skating or 

572.12 580.15 B: um you know with the winter sports like even luge or you know something that i wouldn't normally you know put on t._v. 

579.94 580.81 A: right 

580.39 584.14 B: um for some reason it just really gets my interest 

584.19 586.34 B: and i enjoy watching it 

586.64 591.64 A: yeah i would say another sport that i like to watch um is boxing 

592.12 593.30 B: oh 

592.68 599.17 A: and it really depends upon who's boxing [laughter] that's the only re- the only way i would watch it 

598.62 599.95 B: right 

599.38 599.89 A: and
