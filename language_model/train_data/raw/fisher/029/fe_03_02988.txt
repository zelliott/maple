113.64 114.54 B: (( [laughter] that's )) 

114.36 123.04 A: no there's like a blizzard out but now it's better 'cause we live in our house and um have a back yard so i can just let her out and let her terrorize the neighbors

135.70 145.32 A: and so she always goes over there because they always like feed her chocolate and stuff like that [laughter] so it's easy to find her she's um she's pretty small she's like fifty five pound she's ah a um

172.75 174.49 B: it- it's my parents' yes 

173.90 185.02 A: okay i had a cocker spaniel growing up it was a whole different experience than having like a dog with this much 'cause she's all muscle she's like one big muscle the dog i have now and if she doesn't 

181.22 182.78 B: (( right mm )) 

185.16 190.76 A: if we don't take her like on excursions and luckily i'm pretty like to go hiking and stuff but if she doesn't go 

190.97 203.94 A: if there [laughter] like five days passes she doesn't go somewhere to really really run she starts tearing things apart in the house which is kind of my fault i feel like at this point 'cause i knew when i got her that i would have to 

198.28 199.15 B: (( [laughter] )) 

204.02 205.66 A: spend a lot of time 

206.08 210.27 A: with her and i i guess she was really abused at her old 

206.23 207.04 B: right 

210.43 214.72 A: her old in her past life 'cause she has psychological scarring [laughter] 

212.59 213.15 B: (( [mn] )) 

214.39 215.81 B: (( that's no good )) 

215.21 217.55 A: [laughter] anywa- 

216.77 227.02 B: yeah ou- our two little dogs weren't much of a they were always really good in the house because they were good house pets we had a we had a larger dog before that but he was a little too big for my little sister at the time so we had to get rid of him 

221.51 222.47 A: yeah 

226.99 230.52 A: yeah i kind of worry about that kind of stuff 'cause you know it's such a big 

230.60 234.26 A: commitment she'll be around for like the next fourteen years 

233.56 235.01 B: right 

234.44 238.50 A: and it you know she's really she can be real crazy sometimes though 

238.54 240.50 A: i worry if i have kids 

240.29 241.43 B: mhm 

240.83 250.18 A: i have a kid and she's gonna be like all over the place but hopefully by then i'll have a bigger yard be able to like build a structure or something not be renting anymore 

245.38 246.68 B: right 

249.76 251.97 B: do you let your dog run round the entire house 

251.70 253.29 A: yeah yeah 

252.68 257.14 B: okay we never used to do that there wa- there was always places that the dogs were restricted 

256.58 260.25 A: yeah i don't let her in my i paint so i don't let her in my studio 

257.45 258.03 B: (( oh )) 

260.00 261.06 B: okay 

260.44 268.73 A: it's because she walks through it and she's all over the place she has like some she has some blue on her ear right now actually it's very becoming [laughter] 

261.30 263.02 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

266.37 267.08 B: (( [laughter] i )) 

268.28 269.59 B: (( don't )) 

269.28 272.40 A: so the blue really sets off her eyes her skin tone 

272.80 273.65 A: [laughter] 

274.03 276.46 A: (( but and i also have a cat i've had it )) 

277.14 280.87 A: since i was in highschool and he's just he's been around forever 

281.16 282.76 B: like cats too much 

282.53 283.78 A: (( you don't [laughter] )) 

283.16 288.37 B: no i'm always a dog person i cats aren't as i don't know not as loveable not as 

288.66 290.17 B: (( i don't know [laughter] oh )) 

289.84 296.98 A: mine's developed a kind of a weird behavior lately he's always been really good and he's always been more like a dog like he comes when you call him 

297.04 298.23 B: okay 

297.32 300.44 A: and he plays with you and stuff like that and 

299.54 302.34 B: yeah so that's why i i guess i just never liked cats they 

301.68 309.03 A: most cats aren't like that he's kind of an exception but now lately he he cries all night because we're sleeping 

303.29 304.19 B: right 

308.98 322.34 A: and he doesn't want us to sleep [laughter] and it works [laughter] because it keeps me awake [laughter] so it hasn't been good lately i don't know what i'm gonna do about that i can't think of like what you're supposed to do in that situation i should call the pet psychic 

310.53 311.53 B: yeah 

322.20 324.97 B: you should probably just ah not let him in the bedroom 

324.39 329.56 A: he he doesn't he's outside the door he cries so loud though he's he can i can hear him 

326.47 327.42 B: (( oh )) 

329.18 330.34 B: okay 

330.24 342.60 A: when he first started doing it it was when we were still letting him in the bedroom and he'd get right up like right by my face and right two inches from my face let out the biggest wail [laughter] to wake me up i thought there was a fire 

334.00 334.88 B: right 

342.69 349.22 A: but no we don't let him in the bedroom but he still manages to wake us up but i don't know 

343.36 343.92 B: (( [mn] )) 

349.65 352.19 A: he's go- um maybe i should sedate him 

351.90 352.88 B: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

352.27 354.24 A: in the evenings [laughter] 

354.30 358.14 B: maybe i don't know if there's a hallway between your bedroom and 

357.62 366.19 A: no unfortunately the house is so small i feel like anywhere that he yelled it's like a really bizarre little house it's set up um 

361.90 363.12 B: (( oh okay )) 

366.22 377.78 A: i think it's the kind of the plainest place where someone added on a room because they had fifty more dollars in their pocket you know [laughter] which is not a good reason to add on a room for a good price so [laughter] 

372.34 373.84 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] oh )) 

378.13 381.14 A: it's funny it doesn't matter though 'cause it's just a rental 

381.32 382.31 B: okay 

382.64 385.02 A: so can you have animals where you live now 

384.54 389.76 B: um actually the policy is normally no but i just have a little old landlady and she's 

389.89 400.15 B: when i moved in she said that if i wanted to i we could talk about it so she doe- she doesn't prefer it but i don't as long as it's smaller animals i don't think she has much of a problem with it but 

393.12 394.31 A: right 

396.77 397.67 A: right 

399.95 402.84 A: we had all kinds of ex- snakes and things when i was little 

402.68 406.58 B: i have a friend that like collects snakes like she has like six 

406.01 408.54 A: oh really does she have any interesting 

406.70 410.84 B: yeah and she insis- i i don't even know what they are she insists that they're cute 

409.57 410.74 A: (( no [laughter] )) 

410.76 412.22 A: yeah [laughter] 

411.45 415.25 B: i never see that though when i see them i mean i see interesting 

414.90 416.76 A: [laughter] 

415.32 418.85 B: no but she she insists that they're the cutest things in 

418.20 424.29 A: my brothers had all these snakes and we used to fill up a baby pool in the back yard so they could play and take baths and stuff [laughter] 

424.93 426.99 A: and um it 

427.36 438.55 A: it was very interesting they would be at like all over the yard and they'd always they'd always be getting loose always and they'd always be in the bathtub when you're stepping in to take a shower or something you know you'd always have to watch where you'd step 

438.47 441.81 B: the bathtub they'd they'd just roam free 

439.45 440.64 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

441.21 444.24 A: they kept getting out they're they were like escape artists 

442.43 445.40 B: (( oh okay i was going to say what [laughter] [mn] oh )) 

444.91 448.01 A: and he had so many that he had to build these little um 

448.26 452.66 A: structures and they weren't really the kind of thing that you're supposed to keep snakes in i don't think 

454.02 456.46 A: we lived in florida so you'd just find them 

456.34 458.02 B: okay yeah 

456.80 463.49 A: all over the place we'd find we'd find sad cases like this this gardener snake we had for a while um 

463.55 466.11 A: cut run over by my uncle's lawnmower 

466.13 467.63 B: (( mm )) 

466.31 473.75 A: and he went flying and i guess he went through the mechanism and it broke his back it was really sad and it's like a three foot snake 

473.64 481.66 A: so i took it inside and i just fed it fish and um they really like little minnows they live near creeks i don't know if you're familiar [mn] 

481.42 485.10 B: i didn't know snakes could break there back though so that kind of threw me 

484.79 491.86 A: yeah yeah it had it had like a um it healed because i was feeding it and it just stayed really still and it healed but it 

491.98 497.31 A: this is going to sound like a i'm making it up like it's a cartoon or something but the back was kind of bent so 

497.44 501.52 A: he would no matter where he crawled it would eventually be like a big circle 

501.92 505.06 B: [mn] i don't understand they don't have bones so like what did they break oh 

504.51 508.71 A: i don't know but he healed i don't know what happened to him but he was crooked 

508.33 509.41 B: okay 

508.79 509.95 A: (( in the middle )) 

510.07 512.80 A: they don't have bones what kind of skeletons do they have 

512.81 518.90 B: i guess they do for like the the their body isn't is it i i guess their skull i don't know 

517.68 522.28 A: yeah i don't know what snakes have i know at the um natural history museum 

522.42 525.00 A: they have the bones of bigger snakes 

524.44 526.05 B: all right well i guess they do 

525.01 529.80 A: so those have those have but i don't know about the little ones 'cause this guy was like a little skinny thing 

530.18 531.91 A: so i don't know but whatever 

530.95 534.22 B: i i guess i just never thought of them as having bones just because uh 

535.00 540.44 A: yeah i don't know but they're so strong when they constrict but it seems like they're just one long muscle 

538.86 542.17 B: hm right i guess that's the way i always thought of em 

541.91 548.48 A: or like kind of like insects kind of like maybe an exoskeleton [laughter] their scales serve as an exoskeleton or something 

544.46 545.51 B: right 

547.50 552.46 B: right i guess they have to have a skull i can't imagine them not having a skull so they must have 

548.67 549.45 A: i don't 

550.00 551.06 A: yeah 

551.72 556.98 A: oh they do have a skull because um when their jaw unhinges they can swallow big rats 

555.92 557.66 B: right 

557.48 558.48 A: but um 

558.95 561.07 A: are we supposed to not be off topic 

560.92 562.58 B: well it's still pets 

562.35 571.11 A: oh okay [laughter] but anyway so he would go in big circles and eventually he just died and i don't know if it was from his injuries 'cause he didn't seem like he was old 

562.96 564.45 B: [laughter] 

571.33 577.59 A: i wouldn't know i guess so how would i know he was old he just looked so fresh and green [laughter] 

572.52 573.82 B: right [laughter] 

575.58 576.66 B: [laughter] 

576.87 580.71 B: was it a little garden snakes i don- i guess i wouldn't think of them living that long 

580.67 587.62 A: yeah i don't know 'cause most snakes live a long time my brother's snakes lived a long time he has a ball python right now 

583.40 584.81 B: really mm 

587.87 596.12 A: and it's been around for like um twenty years that we know of 'cause it was um our cousin's snake who's older and he gave it to him 

596.85 599.89 A: um so that's i mean i think it's been
