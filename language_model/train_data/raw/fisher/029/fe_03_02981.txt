92.13 93.38 A: they don't fly away 

93.59 105.12 B: well they're older when they were young we used to clip their wings so that they couldn't fly of course we don't let them outside you know they're in the house they're out of their cages but in the house 

100.79 102.22 A: oh just inside 

102.66 103.73 A: oh so 

104.49 106.87 A: so really there's really nowhere to go i guess 

106.59 113.98 B: no it it they um it wouldn't be safe with them outside first of all even if you trained them to come back to you 

113.83 114.51 A: mm 

113.96 121.96 B: there are predators out there that they wouldn't know what to do about but they can fly through the house although they mostly choose to walk 

122.28 123.45 A: (( [noise] [noise] really )) 

122.28 126.61 B: you know they foll- follow you around on the floor like a little puppy 

126.58 127.63 A: (( hm )) 

127.02 128.30 B: [laughter] 

128.18 130.20 A: that's really interesting tha- that they get along 

130.65 144.79 B: ah yeah um tw- but they have two of them are big birds and one's a smaller bird and the two big ones play together i have a cockatoo and an african grey and they play together and ah every once in a while they are like kids you know they'll have a little spat 

141.06 142.24 A: (( [noise] )) 

144.68 151.56 B: and go their separate ways and then they're playing together again the other one just sort of ignores them and does her own thing 

152.18 160.69 B: she she mainly hangs out on her the top of her cage and looks out the windows and if i walk by she jumps on me [laughter] you 

160.54 161.43 A: huh 

160.99 161.79 B: know

166.34 167.25 B: yeah 

166.39 167.60 A: cages all day 

167.51 172.53 B: yeah well most most people think that birds are ah 

172.99 178.59 B: you know something to look at and i put it that way you put them in a cage you give them water and seeds but 

178.61 191.56 B: birds are much more than that and once you start interacting with them yo- you realise that i mean like our birds eat dinner with us you know they eat little bits of the food that we eat they always have seeds and water in the cage but 

186.43 187.41 A: really 

191.50 194.28 B: you know in the morning they'll have scrambled eggs with us 

194.41 198.24 B: or you know if we eat chicken wings they eat the bone 

198.56 201.34 A: [laughter] is that good for them 

198.57 199.76 B: [laughter] 

199.98 205.74 B: oh yeah they crack open the bones spit out the hard part and eat the marrow it's very good for them 

206.44 209.11 B: a little bit cannibalistic but [laughter] 

206.80 207.78 A: (( oh how interest- )) 

208.55 211.48 A: yeah oh wow how long have you had them for 

211.68 215.04 B: um the one we've had ah

218.92 230.87 B: no twelve years next month and one we've had ten years and one we've had eight and they were all babies when we got them we hand fed them and you know watched them grow their feathers and learn to fly and so on 

223.39 223.95 A: (( [mn] )) 

230.89 232.81 A: (( do they live that long now birds )) 

232.61 239.02 B: oh yeah the cockatoo could live as long as seventy years they're in our will yeah 

237.02 238.08 A: seventy 

238.80 240.90 A: that's a long time 

239.67 245.11 B: it sure is they're they're in our will you know we have a lot of grandchildren so 

242.58 243.44 A: uh-huh 

245.36 255.81 B: certain grandchildren are going to get the birds [laughter] because we wouldn't want to you know have them just put in a a like a humane society or something 

248.78 250.39 A: [laughter] 

255.97 259.97 B: they know our grandchildren and they would be comfortable with them 

260.17 261.96 A: [noise] seventy years wow 

260.18 261.02 B: (( you know )) 

261.75 263.94 B: yeah my my 

263.03 264.19 A: longer than you 

263.98 264.84 B: pardon 

264.68 266.36 A: [laughter] longer than some people 

266.04 276.21 B: well that's the truth and and that's why you really have to take care of them and put them in your will because if you don't what happens to them you know i mean if something happened to you 

276.22 289.99 B: ah the authorities would kind of put them in a um like a humane society or whatever and maybe try to adopt them out and meanwhile they're used to a certain activity certain food and so on and um 

290.10 291.68 B: so they're in our will 

291.94 302.67 B: you know [laughter] each grandchild that's gonna get a bird knows about it and if something happens to us they've already said that they're willing to take the bird and you know care for it for as long as they 

302.73 304.70 B: it lives you know 

304.10 306.78 A: well that's good you obviously have a contingency plan 

306.54 313.73 B: yeah you know having a b- bird is like having children you've gotta specify you know who's gonna take care of them 

313.98 324.09 B: you know most peo- everybody'll take a dog everybody'll take a cat but birds are unique you know and everybody doesn't wanna bird they're messy and noisy and 

318.23 319.30 A: yeah 

324.43 327.59 B: you know all sorts of things so [laughter] 

326.70 329.98 A: yeah so what else were we supposed to talk about [noise]

361.92 362.85 B: yeah 

362.57 363.79 A: obviously my mother 

364.19 375.92 B: yeah well cats yeah they they are unique they they don't need a lot of time and the time they spend with you is what they want to spend with you not what you wan- 'em to spend necessarily

376.56 390.36 B: yeah yeah well we've had cats i enjoy cats i love cats but with the dog we have a dog that chases everything it sees and then of course with the birds the cat would either be you know 

390.34 398.70 B: ah somebody would be going after it or it would be going after someone so [laughter] we had to eliminate the thought of a cat
