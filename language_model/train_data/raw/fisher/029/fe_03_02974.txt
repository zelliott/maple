100.41 101.28 A: mhm 

101.50 103.05 A: yeah yeah i guess 

104.83 108.17 A: i still don't know the rules for baseball [laughter] 

107.63 114.85 B: you know it just it seems very silly e- especially since all they're really doing is you know hitting the ball and running around 

114.82 116.08 A: mhm 

114.99 117.81 B: [laughter] you know it seems a little too uh 

118.08 121.63 B: complex considering what they're actually doing 

120.35 123.61 A: yeah do you like basketball 

125.07 132.22 B: um [lipsmack] you know i never really watched it i remember being in like uh junior high and thinking like dennis rodman was cool [laughter] but 

132.35 134.48 B: as for the sport itself 

132.36 135.41 A: [laughter] yeah dennis rodman i liked him too 

135.24 141.07 B: yeah [laughter] i know i it's just funny 'cause i never really watched the sport i just kinda found him amusing 

137.57 138.15 A: (( [laughter] )) 

141.70 143.54 A: yeah yeah yeah me too 

141.72 142.62 B: but 

143.30 150.68 B: yeah i don't really i don't really watch it i actually kind of make sure i turn it off if it's sports [laughter] most of the time 

150.39 151.71 A: [noise] yeah me too 

151.44 159.58 B: um a friend of mine wanted to go hang out and they were like oh we're watching the lakers game i'm like okay then i'm not coming over so 

159.02 168.53 A: [noise] well yeah yeah i know i know and like when it's superbowl you know like everybody will stay at home [noise] and have parties and you know it's like no [noise] 

164.98 166.77 B: yeah 

167.26 170.00 B: and i'm like wait what it's the superbowl oh 

170.21 174.41 B: i hear the commercials are good [laughter] 

170.61 171.28 A: (( [noise] y- )) 

172.02 180.72 A: yeah i know [laughter] do you think it's mainly a guy thing like the guys are more into sports than than women are or [noise] 

174.48 175.62 B: yeah 

180.01 187.97 B: i i think that's so but i also think it's kind of silly because i think there's a lot of guys who aren't into sports and they're like looked down on 

188.01 190.17 B: because they're not into sports i- 

190.40 193.95 A: yeah you know what you're right you're totally right 

193.34 200.57 B: it seems like the very like macho like tough jock guy to be into sports and like the football star and everything 

200.51 202.07 A: yeah yeah yeah 

201.65 210.51 B: 'cause i even know like from my boyfriend he likes soccer and that's about it and he doesn't really play sports i guess he did when he was in high school 

202.08 203.47 A: yeah i think you're right 

206.11 207.61 A: mhm 

210.73 217.40 B: but you know in high school he was not like popular 'cause he wasn't an athlete or he wasn't you know 

210.90 212.22 A: mhm 

217.56 219.36 B: mr football star 

219.54 222.75 A: i know a lot of times that's what happens mhm 

222.37 225.63 B: it seems really silly 'cause you know i mean it 

225.78 231.27 B: sports are good because you know you can be athletic and it's a good way to 

231.30 237.92 B: get out of the house and burn some energy but you know as a requirement for popularity it seems a little fun [noise] 

232.82 234.11 A: yeah 

238.10 239.75 A: yeah i think you're right 

240.04 241.30 B: yeah 

240.38 245.64 A: and do you like olympics like gymnastics and stuff like this 'cause this seems to me go ahead 

243.42 244.28 B: (( you know )) 

245.46 251.07 B: i really did like like the gymnastics but i [sigh] you know like you know like you said um 

251.53 253.86 B: don't really have time to follow it 

253.25 255.19 A: yeah me too mhm 

254.31 256.07 B: so um 

257.17 267.49 B: [noise] i don't know like i don't watch the olympics when they're on now but i remember as a kid i really liked watching like gymnastics and ice skating but those are like the the girl sports you know 

260.86 261.60 A: mhm 

266.94 269.41 A: yeah mhm yeah [noise] 

268.44 275.12 B: there's like the girl sports and the guy sports and i mean soccer got kind of big with females for a while because the women's team got big 

275.10 288.86 B: but you know it's still not really a female thing females are supposed to be like shopping and hair and makeup and [laughter] all of the you know and guys supposed to be sports i mean i know it's not really supposed to be like that there's supposed to be equality now 

275.34 276.33 A: mhm 

283.33 284.71 A: yeah i know 

288.18 289.02 A: mhm 

288.86 292.77 B: but i think society still kinda sees male female roles 

289.18 290.53 A: mhm 

291.54 293.31 A: (( yeah )) 

293.72 295.80 A: do you like what about boxing 

295.94 300.08 B: i like boxing i do it- it's bad because i do 

298.13 299.17 A: you do 

300.18 303.58 B: i you know it's bad because it's like violent 

303.73 311.08 B: but i actually do follow a little bit of boxing like when it's on i'll watch it or like 

311.89 321.17 B: sometimes when there's like a big hype around it or like a big fight coming up i find myself being more interested in it actually when i was young i kind of wanted to be a boxer for a while 

321.13 322.34 A: mhm 

321.20 327.56 B: but then thought my nose would probably get pretty ugly from people hitting it all the time so i kind of resorted 

326.17 327.86 A: yeah it would have [noise] 

327.57 331.43 B: back to that female attitude and it was like no i don't wanna get hit 

331.73 336.82 A: what about um oh what is it uh wrestling do you like wrestling [noise] 

331.79 332.61 B: so 

336.30 341.63 B: you know [laughter] when i was really young i watched like wwf [laughter] 

340.19 342.13 A: me too me too same thing 

341.91 351.68 B: yeah i don't know why i mean looking back i you know i crack up and go why did i watch that but no i i did i did watch w._w._f. and i liked like all the 

351.70 357.46 B: superstars and like hulk hogan and the whole thing but not so much now 

356.18 368.16 A: once i found out that um uh um once i found out that they were actually like not real about it like everything was fake then i kinda lost interest [laughter] 

357.62 358.55 B: mhm 

363.56 364.57 B: uh-huh 

367.87 371.80 B: yeah yeah that kinda happened for me also like 

371.90 380.39 B: i started kinda associating with like white trash kinda like how people um associate nascar [laughter] nascar with white trash so 

376.13 377.73 A: yeah yeah 

379.98 380.95 A: uh-huh 

380.58 385.95 B: um that kinda lost i kinda lost it that way as well [laughter] 

385.42 386.75 A: yeah i know 

386.10 389.81 B: yeah well it it's funny when they first said it was fake i didn't believe it 

389.91 394.32 A: me me neither i i thought it was real too but then no i 

393.82 395.99 B: no not at all [laughter] 

394.78 397.11 A: mean it's totally fake right everything 

396.85 400.23 B: yeah i don't think it's even slightly real ever 

400.84 406.44 B: i don't know i guess that's kinda cool though that they can suck that many people into it and i think that's 

401.27 402.03 A: (( true )) 

405.22 407.86 A: yeah and everybody know it's fake you know 

407.18 410.67 B: yeah oh i know and people still totally watch it 

410.70 411.67 A: yeah 

410.80 418.66 B: but then again that's television and society thin- a lot of things are fake and people still watch it like it's a train wreck or something [sigh] 

416.24 418.93 A: mhm yeah 

418.94 421.39 B: um yeah 

420.83 424.06 A: (( oh and and um )) 

424.56 428.63 A: (( what about uh car racing do you like car racing )) 

428.32 438.81 B: you know my parents like it but i think it's ridiculous i mean i think like street racing and things like that if you're actually involved in it is cool but as for like watching it on television 

439.03 444.89 B: i don't know i don't see any appeal to just watching a car drive around and round on track 

444.03 447.37 A: [noise] yeah [noise] yeah it's kinda boring you're right 

447.30 452.14 B: i don't know there doesn't seem to be a lot of sports that are that interesting to me like 

452.56 457.42 B: baseball i went to baseball games as a kid but it's really boring to watch on t._v. 

457.81 462.44 A: [noise] yeah yeah yeah yeah well i don't i still don't know the rules of baseball 

459.43 462.00 B: it's like you're always waiting for something to happen

463.50 465.22 A: [laughter] 

464.97 471.27 B: i think i did when i watched it a lot but like you know i lack interest in it now so i definitely 

470.46 471.30 A: mhm

498.33 508.35 B: you know i don't really have time and when i am home a lot of my work i have to be on the internet to like seek out more jobs and email people and things like that so 

507.85 508.85 A: mhm
