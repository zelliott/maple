166.38 170.54 A: to is it i thought it always had something to do with the with manufacturing 

170.73 178.65 A: that it was like that akron was i have never i guess i must have been imagining this that akron was in some way a a zipper manufacturing capital or something like that 

177.92 180.95 B: well i never heard that before i might have to check this out 

180.40 183.80 A: well i mean if that i'd be interested [laughter] in hearing what you come up with 'cause it 

183.03 186.24 B: and that's really strange because i used to do um 

186.40 196.18 B: some catering and stuff and i i catered parties for the akron you know the akron zip every year in september it was like the big the big thing to do you know 

195.78 198.19 A: who's their big rival akron

217.31 220.95 B: uh just um an aide just a student aide 

220.70 221.38 A: uh-huh 

221.42 226.58 B: uh it's it's interesting and i wouldn't wanna do it in a big city but it's nice in in a small town 

226.14 235.15 A: that's tough i have a lot of friends who very much wanna teach and something about the idea i think of just doing it in new york is uh 

234.75 236.02 B: yeah 

235.74 237.78 A: very very difficult for people like 

236.55 242.90 B: it would be scar- i wouldn't even wanna do it in cleveland i wouldn't want my job in canton or [laughter] akron even you know 

241.24 254.24 A: [laughter] i know it's tough 'cause it's like you i mean you know that it's a place that needs help but at the same time it's just i mean it's something that i thought about doing but i mean i grew up in the suburbs and i was used to a very difficult i think 

246.86 247.80 B: yeah 

251.71 252.50 B: (( mhm )) 

254.67 259.53 A: like culture of how one goes about going to school and up here it's like 

257.78 258.98 B: right 

259.05 264.56 B: you try to relate to the kids you know now that are gonna like if you live new york you live close to the city 

263.06 263.92 A: if i'm 

264.24 268.55 A: i'm in the city i'm in the city yeah i grew up well i grew up in jersey and then i uh 

264.90 266.73 B: you're right in the city 

268.76 272.15 A: i moved in here uh a couple of years back 

271.65 274.41 B: (( okay that's where my husband is now in jersey he )) 

272.31 273.11 A: and 

274.03 275.21 A: really where in 

274.63 280.00 B: goes to jersey i'm not sure he needs to call me and let me know [laughter] he drives for 

277.40 278.98 A: [laughter] 

279.12 280.89 A: well is he lost or something 

280.26 285.04 B: no he's drives a truck he's probably making a delivery somewhere i don't know he 

282.77 283.68 A: yeah 

284.22 291.31 A: there's a lot a lot of [laughter] truck driving stuff going on in jersey i used to have a job for a while where i had a lot of uh interaction with 

291.33 299.57 A: the local guys i know the the real over the road stuff seems a lot more like those guys probably have a better time they have to travel a lot more i guess but 

292.54 293.53 B: mhm 

299.13 301.60 B: yeah but they do a lot of sitting and waiting 

301.19 305.14 A: yeah the the local guys were terrible drivers which really surprised me 

301.70 302.64 B: (( for no reason )) 

304.77 306.37 B: [laughter] yeah they are 

305.39 317.48 A: 'cause i had i had this job for a summer i was paving parking lots and they'd be in jersey because there's all these i i mean i don't it used to be mobbed up and now i don't even know what the story is but it used to be this like 

317.76 322.34 A: you could like the over the road guys would take it but then they'd have to drop off at a certain point 

321.80 322.98 B: mhm 

322.38 332.89 A: so that they the local guys could pick up because the local guys had a contract and the over the road guys didn't and the local guys and they just about ran over one of my friends one time we were like paving something it just 

324.24 325.23 B: mhm 

326.07 327.09 B: yeah 

327.26 329.13 B: they weren't allowed to go in that area 

330.77 331.59 B: (( oh )) 

332.61 333.64 B: oh yeah 

333.00 337.20 A: they didn't even have the excuse of having been up for forty eight hours [laughter] you know they were just like 

335.43 338.45 B: [laughter] they're just bad drivers 

337.23 339.20 A: inept at what they did 

338.91 340.53 B: bad drivers 

339.77 343.64 A: but yeah no i uh i grew up there and i came into the city and i uh 

343.79 353.01 A: i don't know like i work at brooklyn college now i have a a d- my day job is there i'm a i'm a writer and i that's what i what i like to do but the uh 

348.07 349.08 B: oh 

349.83 350.55 B: (( okay )) 

353.31 358.71 A: brooklyn college is is kind of interesting there's a lot of public school like kids out of the new york public school system that go there 

358.32 359.37 B: (( oh okay )) 

359.08 365.27 A: and it actually seems like you know a lot of them are are real smart and everything it just seems like it's a very difficult place to 

365.88 375.12 A: to go to school like new york just because of the fact that the system's kinda underfunded and like nobody really pays much attention to it [sigh] 

367.45 368.51 B: (( i'm sure it is )) 

374.17 375.56 B: that's sad too 

375.50 381.81 A: it is 'cause i think i don't know exactly how much better it can be like city school systems are just sort of 

381.83 384.03 A: they're rough as a general rule i think 

383.28 384.42 B: mhm 

384.28 391.83 A: but like new york is sort of like the whole rest of the state spends a lot of time fighting about whether or not you know their money's going into new york and like 

391.26 400.78 B: yeah that seems to be nationwide right now though with the with the school funding the library funding and kind of uh hot topics right 

394.03 395.07 A: (( yeah i don't )) 

399.82 412.77 A: it is yes my sister was in detroit and apparently like she says that there it's like it's this big code word for like when the rest of michigan talks about detroit they're basically like you don't want give your money there like you don't wanna send there 

411.93 412.86 B: (( now [laughter] )) 

412.69 419.92 A: it's just basically like something that nobody will really talk about that like there's like this big city who are all split which is sort of i 

419.92 421.41 B: oh it's amazing 

420.07 426.92 A: don't know yeah i can still feel it in [laughter] in new york i mean like just having grown up in the suburbs like there's a lot of things about the city that don't 

426.97 428.92 A: quite rub me properly 

428.43 429.29 B: (( no )) 

429.07 431.64 A: but [laughter] it's sort of the way it is 

431.37 434.33 B: down in akron that's why we kinda moved out [laughter] 

433.57 440.32 A: yeah so you were in akron for some of the some of your your adult life then or i mean you just grew up there yeah 

437.54 444.94 B: mhm mhm mhm yeah well i grew up there then and some of my adult life then my husband transferred down here and 

444.91 453.42 B: of course that company went out of business but [laughter] then now he's working in akron again but we're just commuting [laughter] he's working out of akron not in it and 

446.98 447.89 A: [laughter] 

452.53 455.72 A: jeeze that's uh the company what company was this 

455.32 462.48 B: uh um the company that went out of business well he last worked for consolidated freightways which you might be familiar with they went out 

457.57 458.54 A: mhm 

461.64 466.09 A: i think i have heard the name like i've certainly probably seen it on the side of a truck somewhere at least 

463.31 463.90 B: (( yeah )) 

464.33 470.23 B: yeah well like labor day they went out of business and put thousands of people out of work so 

469.49 471.13 A: jeeze just recently 

470.81 473.34 B: uh september labor day yeah 

472.75 474.07 A: that's terrible 

473.54 474.31 B: yeah 

474.12 475.29 A: (( [mn] man )) 

475.52 477.62 B: so back to sports what do you watch 

476.84 490.22 A: yeah there you go [laughter] i was watching the nicks actually just now that's my my local basketball team my uh and they just beat the celtics i'm very happy and incidentally i happen actually be wearing a cleveland browns shirt here around my house 

477.83 479.24 B: [laughter] 

482.52 484.17 B: yeah yeah yeah 

485.57 487.07 B: well good 

489.83 491.97 B: oh well now how did you get that 

491.36 498.01 A: i got that uh pretty much strictly by coincidence i um i'm not really a collector makes it sound real serious 

497.76 498.58 B: mhm 

498.00 508.17 A: i just periodically when i'm at work and don't have that much to do i'll look for cheap jerseys on ebay so i got one for a guy who was i would unless you were a huge browns fan with a really good memory 

502.17 503.21 B: oh okay 

506.64 507.48 B: mhm 

508.04 509.08 B: mhm 

508.46 510.92 A: uh it's an eric duret jersey 

511.38 515.75 A: the only reason i really liked the guy i remembered him from when he was in college went to the university of florida but 

511.48 512.24 B: (( mm )) 

515.11 516.11 B: (( oh okay )) 

515.84 520.98 A: what's amazing about him is just that he spells his first name in a way that i've never seen anyone spell it before 

521.09 527.46 A: it was er- so his name is eric red but his first name was spelt e. r. r. i. c. c. t. 

527.31 528.08 B: (( oh )) 

528.31 537.30 A: which is just like three or four more letters than are necessary but but you you gotta be impressed by it but yeah so that was i didn't realize that 

528.62 529.27 B: (( wow okay )) 

531.72 533.23 B: yeah exactly 

534.23 535.55 B: [laughter] 

536.62 538.27 B: (( catches your attention doesn't it mm )) 

537.72 542.30 A: yeah but i um yeah i was definitely watching the uh i was watching my nets just now 

542.38 549.37 B: i watch uh i watch uh o- ohio state games too i should say because it's not considered professional here though that's college 

549.04 550.80 A: there's nothing wrong with it they're you know 

550.37 551.23 B: (( no )) 

550.84 552.84 A: it's [laughter] nominally college 

552.00 566.79 B: we had some local players some people from this area that well uh steve grant who plays on uh ohio state was from oh about fifteen miles from here so he grew up here and yeah it's kinda kinda neat when you can watch and some hometown people are playing 

560.68 561.53 A: really 

566.45 569.25 A: i guess i shouldn't say this but my sister went to university of michigan 

569.80 571.15 B: (( ooh ouch )) 

569.95 576.75 A: i hope i hope just 'cause you shouldn't hang up on me 'cause we're not going to get our ten dollars if you do all right i appreciate that [laughter] but 

573.33 575.34 B: yeah right i won't hang up on ya 

575.50 579.65 B: [laughter] oh it's too bad she had to do that but [laughter] 

577.70 587.47 A: i never i never really got that into that rivalry but like i know my father who and my father you know whatever like he grew up in jersey city new jersey like he didn't go to a big college like 

580.44 581.08 B: (( mm )) 

586.86 588.01 B: mhm 

587.36 599.89 A: but he really latched onto that he just loves the idea that like my sister went to a major football scho- i went to a little school out in california like not a big you know athletic program by any stretch and i think he just i've seen him do it like if you see 

593.91 594.88 B: (( mm [laughter] )) 

596.27 597.27 B: mhm
