365.03 366.14 A: (( yeah so )) 

367.17 373.66 A: but this is the tough one um this is my third survey or call or whatever they're called but um 

374.25 379.45 A: the other two topics were so easy and and just talking and talking 

380.05 383.57 A: (( but i don't know what to say about sports [laughter] )) 

382.18 387.11 B: i know i know i was just going to say the same thing the other ones i could relate to but this um 

387.38 394.49 B: [noise] i don't know i i know nothing about sports but i wanted to you know accept the call 'cause i figured it'd be interesting to 

394.85 395.84 B: you know 

395.88 397.11 A: (( yeah )) 

396.06 399.70 B: if the person on the other end may have known about sports but 

399.27 401.25 A: (( i i i mean i know )) 

401.38 415.28 A: s- how the games are played except for football that's the only one i could never figure out and and it's not the type of game where you can ask questions during the game because you're going to got get something thrown at you 

404.44 405.60 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

415.40 418.69 B: right [laughter] that's true [laughter] 

415.56 416.83 A: (( you know [laughter] )) 

417.03 424.66 A: like like you never go to a superbowl party and think well what is that and you're like shh [laughter] 

423.03 425.80 B: you'll be kicked out for sure [laughter] 

426.00 436.76 A: so i mean nobody is willing to explain the game to you and you're really can't ask questions unless you're watching the game because you don't know what to ask questions about 

436.12 438.33 B: mhm right 

436.96 438.53 A: and so 

438.99 443.67 A: unless my son starts playing football i'll probably never know what it's about 

443.19 445.37 B: (( [noise] [laughter] i think you're probably right then )) 

445.56 452.24 B: see i got trained from growing up and that's all that was ever on on the weekends and everything at my house from my dad and my brother 

451.97 452.94 A: (( [laughter] uh-oh )) 

452.89 458.92 B: so that's all we ever watched sports all year round it was annoying [noise] [laughter] 

458.20 458.78 A: (( yeah )) 

459.18 464.95 A: [laughter] luckily my father never liked sports well he likes baseball but he never watched it on t._v. 

464.64 465.64 B: (( mm )) 

465.19 471.84 A: but um he was never into football and um he never sat down and watched sports 

472.32 481.12 A: and um my mother now she did watch football on t._v. but only when it got to like um the superbowl 

480.77 482.39 B: mhm 

482.16 483.41 A: but she 

483.65 487.78 A: found out like how the game went because my brother was in it 

487.94 488.95 B: who was

492.05 493.00 B: mhm 

494.33 495.15 B: (( oh )) 

494.82 496.58 A: but i was too young

497.83 509.94 A: be able to take up any of that plus i didn't you know i had to tag along to the games too but i was too busy running around playing with the other kids that were there instead of watching the game 

499.63 500.76 B: mhm

545.70 547.77 A: yeah and um well 

547.96 552.47 A: because she was a flyers' wife she always got season tickets
