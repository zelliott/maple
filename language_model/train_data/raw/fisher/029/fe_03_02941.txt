343.48 344.08 A: (( huh )) 

345.99 350.56 A: i think i think it could be here what what's happening with us instead of 

350.81 352.81 A: what's happening on the t._v. 

355.49 357.94 A: have you been in san diego forever 

358.00 363.72 B: [mn] okay right okay um pretty much most of my life yeah i've lived here so 

361.82 364.01 A: mhm 

364.48 365.96 A: it's so pretty there 

364.99 365.65 B: (( i )) 

365.96 372.63 B: i haven't had a really big sports town like like you say texas dal- dallas texas 

368.04 368.71 A: y- 

372.31 380.17 A: yeah yeah [laughter] jeez [laughter] yeah denver's pretty good too about that but you know 

374.43 375.24 B: probably 

375.34 376.83 B: (( vegetable [laughter] )) 

380.31 382.81 A: denver er uh fans are so fickle 

383.26 387.07 A: when they had when they had the superbowl in san diego 

383.51 384.22 B: (( [mn] correct )) 

387.40 389.39 A: denver played washington 

390.03 393.32 A: and uh washington won 

393.62 398.37 A: and the denver fans took their denver jackets out in the middle of the field and burned them 

398.97 404.96 A: and i thought well you know that doesn't show support for your team i mean if they lost somebody's got to lose 

402.48 403.38 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh [mn] [laughter] oh )) 

405.68 412.43 A: i thought that was the most horrible thing i'd ever seen and i said i i used to pull for denver and i wouldn't do it now because i don't like the fans 

413.31 416.01 B: (( oh oh but that would be horrible )) 

413.65 414.73 A: i thought that was 

415.58 417.80 A: i thought that was really sick 

418.08 419.35 A: (( and huh you know )) 

418.29 419.18 B: (( you live [mn] )) 

419.53 423.65 A: in in dallas uh if if dallas lost 

423.68 424.56 B: yeah 

423.93 426.70 A: (( the fans went out to the airport anyway and met them )) 

426.77 427.86 B: yeah that's 

426.85 428.88 A: i never saw a town like that 

428.85 430.66 B: that's really great 

430.07 437.54 A: ye- yeah so uh but [laughter] but that denver bunch they're they're not uh they're not what i call a good fan 

437.72 444.95 B: i think in denver they have a lot of people that move into denver so maybe they're not born and raised 

444.79 447.43 A: maybe that's it could be 

445.43 446.29 B: (( around )) 

447.38 448.92 B: (( yeah but they have like [mn] )) 

447.67 449.60 A: could be but yeah 

450.85 455.38 A: i think if i had been in the denver football team i would have moved out of denver 

455.16 456.16 B: [laughter] 

455.71 459.34 A: you know if they're burning their jackets because i lost the game 

459.65 462.98 A: uh i think i'd say well the heck with you guys 

463.09 464.22 B: (( no kidding )) 

463.32 466.13 A: some people love us we'll just go somewhere else 

466.18 470.79 B: yeah i always feel so bad for the losing team on those big games 

470.46 471.55 A: i do too 

471.73 474.19 A: i do too 'cause they come that far 

474.78 477.85 A: and uh and then when they don't make it it's got to be 

478.06 480.35 A: it's got to be heart wren- wrenching 

481.10 487.16 A: and then people say oh look he's crying well he's emotional and he's not really crying he's uh 

487.24 488.72 A: he's um 

490.06 492.35 A: what is it when you get all all 

492.56 493.18 A: (( [mn] )) 

493.12 494.30 B: (( [mn] yeah [laughter] [mn] oh yeah )) 

493.83 498.60 A: excited and then you're let down uh it's an emotional strain and uh 

499.09 503.24 A: and it's not [laughter] it's just an automatic thing that the body does 

503.28 504.75 B: oh yeah i 

504.84 508.12 B: i don't know i i could never do anything against the team 

507.88 508.68 A: no 

508.33 516.62 B: but um i feel like crying half the time when i look at them and oh they're so what they've been working on for so long 

512.66 513.75 A: yeah 

514.01 515.29 A: and they've tried 

516.20 522.90 A: yeah for the whole season actually some of them for their lifetime and they get to the superbowl and they never make it 

516.73 517.38 B: (( [noise] )) 

520.37 521.27 B: right 

522.92 525.13 B: have their one chance there and 

525.08 530.71 A: uh yeah yeah times pretty pretty heart rending for the guys 

531.40 541.77 A: a on the other hand you know they they make so dang much money [laughter] sometimes you can't feel sorry for them and sometimes you have to [laughter] 

538.87 539.95 B: (( oh yeah [laughter] [mn] [mn] )) 

540.99 546.29 B: well for the really big popular idiot ones i don't really care but [noise] 

545.65 549.20 A: yeah yeah well like baseball the baseball players 

550.24 552.42 A: there's no physical 

553.05 554.16 A: (( um )) 

554.26 555.30 A: harm 

555.65 559.44 A: hardly to them you know sliding in they might hurt theirselves but they're not 

559.70 570.20 A: they're not doing doing anything to hurt theirselves and they if they don't get if i don't get a million dollars this year i'm going to i'm going to go on strike and that that really irritates me 

568.52 569.24 B: oh 

570.13 572.61 B: yeah the past few years i have been 

573.10 576.32 B: just totally turned off by the whole baseball issue 

574.78 575.72 A: yeah 

575.99 580.93 A: the attitude is just uh uh [laughter] i mean they're just playing a game 

581.15 581.93 B: (( yeah )) 

581.19 585.05 A: they're just playing we played it when we were kids we went around them bases
