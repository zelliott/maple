157.40 163.37 A: that happens to me with baseball i like watching hockey in the winter a little bit too like especially if i'm at the bar or something 

163.73 166.82 A: but it definitely can uh interfere 

166.94 174.65 A: 'cause like baseball games go on so long if you if you get into watching 'em sometimes like my whole day will shot or my whole weekend you know 

170.39 171.30 B: (( [noise] )) 

177.24 181.73 A: but no i mean i do you think there's too much too much sports on t._v.

187.96 189.27 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

188.24 201.94 B: i guess like like right now is like the perfect time we've got the draft going on in in camp and we've got basketball in the playoffs hockey's in playoffs baseball starting up you got soccer starting up 

200.91 205.59 A: yeah it's a busy time of year right now the springtime for for sports 

206.14 211.38 A: big time like the- i think that and like right during the holidays too there's a lot of stuff 

210.76 212.09 B: (( right )) 

212.93 215.45 A: (( [sigh] oh i don't know so no )) 

213.59 216.98 B: (( [noise] you watching the basketball um playoffs )) 

217.24 225.44 A: not really i've i've never i've never been a big basketball fan even though i'm from uh the detroit area they 

225.20 236.14 A: i i like i i like playing it some haven't for a long time but i used to like to play it or watch it in like high school to college in in live but not really on t._v. 

233.69 234.29 B: (( yeah )) 

236.21 243.67 A: i just don't feel like it's a great t._v. sport 'cause you're everybody's really good at shooting and they just go back and forth and back and forth [laughter] 

243.03 245.03 B: (( yeah and everybody plays defence )) 

244.68 246.59 A: yeah everybody plays defence i 

246.92 252.20 A: because you know everybody can shoot pretty good you know or they wouldn't be in the m._b._a. [laughter] 

251.54 253.89 B: yeah i kinda i kinda only watch the playoffs 

254.72 256.46 A: you don't like follow it all year 

255.88 258.00 B: i games or whatever 

257.83 261.53 A: yeah yeah and football i find more interesting i mean 

261.75 272.32 A: the biggest thing about american football that drives me crazy watching on t._v. is 'cause it was like made for commercial television so with all those interceptions it likes stops all the time 

268.42 269.62 B: (( mhm )) 

271.74 273.08 B: (( yeah )) 

272.37 276.16 A: so that that always distracts me where if you watch like um 

276.55 282.17 A: you know english football or or australian or something it just keeps going like soccer you know 

282.28 285.85 A: and it's just it's like nonstop crazy action 

285.89 289.45 A: so i think american football sometimes is a little too uh 

289.70 292.31 A: i don't know too structured [laughter] 

291.43 293.59 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

292.95 299.55 A: but it's still fun i mean there's a lot of strategy in it i think a lot of people don't see that it's not just a bunch of guys built like refrigerators you know 

299.38 300.63 B: yeah 

300.03 301.59 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

300.93 304.80 B: so you watch do you watch arena football at all or any of that stuff 

304.54 305.69 A: (( a little bit )) 

305.71 310.76 A: a little bit usually other just with other guys or something i don't i don't really have 

311.14 318.93 A: i'm so busy in in new york i mean it's kind of a bad excuse but i'm so busy a lot of times here like just working and hanging out with friends and everything that 

318.90 329.22 A: i just don't have a lot of time to follow a lot of sports [noise] so if i do i'll i'll like follow it in the papers or online or go to the game but not so much on on t._v. 

329.57 333.74 A: you know it's just i don't have a lot of time to sit in front of the t._v. so 

333.86 345.88 A: [sigh] so for this topic [laughter] following sports on t._v. i just i don't have a lot of time i definitely had a lot more time to watch t._v. when i lived in michigan [laughter] than in new york 

336.34 337.76 B: (( [mn] well uh ))
