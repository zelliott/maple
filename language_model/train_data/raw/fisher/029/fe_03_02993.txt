4.78 5.62 A: (( caris )) 

6.81 10.01 A: i do have a pet um her name is lexa 

10.23 14.52 A: she is with me uh practically all the time 

14.78 19.79 A: the reason is that she's a service dog and has been specially trained 

19.81 22.19 A: to help people with disabilities 

22.38 26.31 A: and um she does things for me like opening dogs 

26.84 30.21 A: helping me transfer from my wheelchair to 

30.29 31.21 A: um 

31.50 35.67 A: the recliner or the bed or the toilet et cetera 

35.90 40.57 A: um [mn] i love her very much she's a wonderful dog 

40.59 42.77 B: that's amazing what kind of dog is it 

42.49 44.41 A: um she's a 

44.65 48.51 A: uh golden retriever and yellow lab mix 

49.11 52.92 B: that's incredible [noise] she can actually help you get from your wheelchair into your bed 

52.84 56.09 A: yes though what she does is she offers balance 

56.70 57.50 A: um 

57.05 58.20 B: (( ah )) 

57.83 68.26 A: so she'll walk with me very um slowly so that i can uh rest my hand on her back and she can give me some balance some support 

68.37 69.69 A: um so 

70.19 72.61 A: that way i'm not as likely to fall 

73.42 77.52 B: that's really incredible and i'm sure she provides a lot of companionship as well 

77.05 85.27 A: oh good lord right now she's sitting in my lap [laughter] this this is a golden lab right i have a fifty pound lapdog 

79.91 81.68 B: she's your best friend i bet 

85.08 91.17 B: wow i just to have a golden retriever but my golden retriever was not nearly as well trained as your dog 

85.53 87.00 A: [laughter] 

90.80 94.47 A: well yeah they spend eight months um 

94.75 96.59 A: with professional trainers 

96.71 102.29 A: and then eight months with puppy raisers and they're taught something like forty three commands 

102.88 104.80 B: that's so incredible 

104.31 108.27 A: it is yeah but you have you have a golden retriever 

105.81 107.51 B: and then you probably don't 

108.49 109.55 B: what's that 

109.01 111.30 A: did you say you had a golden retriever 

109.96 122.27 B: ah yeah i used to have a golden retriever she died quite early she was only eight or nine years old and she died she got i think it's really common for golden retrievers she got some sort of thing on her back it it kinda pussed out like a football 

122.18 134.17 B: and it would suck the blood from her body until she finally um you know she just didn't have anything left in her and it had to be drained it was it was sort of cancerous i don't think it was cancer it was i don't 

134.18 136.12 B: even know what it was i was really young 

136.01 137.02 A: yeah 

136.63 138.27 B: it was really sad 

137.91 141.72 A: yeah they're they're known for tumors some kind of tumors 

138.81 140.38 B: (( i don't know what those things are )) 

140.93 143.16 B: yeah it was some some kind of tumor right 

142.53 146.08 A: right yeah it's so sad i mean you know 

146.16 147.89 B: and how long have you had your dog 

147.54 150.09 A: um i've only had her for a year 

150.11 151.04 B: mhm 

150.77 157.54 A: but she's three years old so all that you know time prior to my receiving her she was in training 

157.65 161.17 A: you know they've got something like twelve thousand dollars in these dogs 

161.39 165.26 B: that's incredible it's probably still a lot cheaper than you having an assistant 

162.32 163.32 A: it is 

165.49 170.72 A: um well i have an assistant too [laughter] i actually have m._s. yeah yeah 

167.40 169.11 B: oh as well right 

170.03 173.54 B: oh that's interesting actually because i worked for a woman with m._s. 

173.28 174.33 A: oh did you 

173.60 183.16 B: for for several months and i was her assistant and i helped her you know get in and out of the wheelchair i took her to swimming and i've done a lot of in home care and um 

183.64 184.43 B: it's 

184.60 186.36 B: m._s. is very hard 

186.07 189.88 A: so she had advanced disease or she was just older 

189.91 191.06 B: um 

191.21 203.60 B: it wasn't extraordinarily advanced she could still walk with a walker but she was extraordinarily hunched over um and she was losing losing her weakness as the days went on she needed to exercise more and 

195.22 195.98 A: mhm 

197.32 198.14 A: right 

203.79 216.81 B: um i think that she was very embarrassed by her condition and as a result she wouldn't spend very much time with her friends or her family and then got got more depressed as a result and then of course it's sort of a domino affect 

216.42 217.40 A: right 

217.69 219.58 A: well one thing leads to another 

217.94 219.76 B: how long have you had m._s. for 

219.74 227.83 A: well i was only diagnosed five years ago so it's gone um very fast for me it's been a rapid progression 

227.95 229.06 B: wow 

228.56 230.16 A: yeah it it it 

230.66 231.51 A: yeah 

232.01 238.75 A: i have a powered wheelchair so um because the lesion that um ate manhattan as i refer to it as uh 

238.54 239.38 B: [laughter] 

238.95 246.36 A: stage three four and five you know is right smack dab in the middle of my neck so everything from the neck down's been affected 

242.84 244.06 B: oh wow 

246.37 247.39 B: mhm 

247.12 249.24 A: and it it's really gone fast 

249.76 251.71 A: so i went to work um 

252.18 257.62 A: on the wednesday for the last time after being diagnosed on monday 

257.74 259.11 B: oh my goodness 

258.58 259.49 A: yeah 

259.72 263.57 A: did you find it hard um to be a a 

263.72 265.76 A: an attendant or a caregiver 

265.22 277.39 B: i did find it hard especially even though this woman uh she had she was in very good spirits and was very optimistic in a lot of ways there were days where i would show up where she just didn't wanna get out of bed and i would have to 

272.30 273.25 A: (( mhm mm )) 

277.47 281.40 B: help her out of bed and convince her that you know the day was worth living 

281.39 292.87 B: and she just would isolate herself so much in in her house she was actually in seattle and she just didn't wanna leave so and other days she was good and she would wanna go shopping and i would take her out to the mall 

290.99 291.78 A: yeah 

292.95 293.86 B: um 

294.22 303.91 B: but yeah it was it was very very trying and exhausting but it it was also was sort of a privilege 'cause it made me realize um how lucky i am and i think that i took 

297.46 298.24 A: yeah 

304.01 309.65 B: life um less for granted after working for her 'cause she's quite quite a courageous woman 

310.13 311.03 A: yeah 

311.27 314.43 B: it's it takes a lot of it takes a lot of courage 

311.79 313.34 A: (( [laughter] i )) 

313.59 320.70 A: i can i can identify with with what you're saying on both ends you know that yeah i s- i see the 

317.76 319.27 B: yeah 

320.75 323.85 A: um anxiety that my caregiver 

324.18 328.69 A: (( goes through and also i am able to identify of course with )) 

325.28 326.20 B: (( uh-huh )) 

328.82 332.74 A: the emotional swing you know that you experience as 

332.78 346.82 A: a person with a chronic illness so actually i i'm i'm quite surprised this is nice i was expecting to be talking to a robot the entire time i didn't realize there was gonna be a person on the other [laughter] end of the phone 

334.64 335.80 B: mhm 

341.41 342.60 B: (( [laughter] i know )) 

344.89 345.94 B: [laughter] 

346.58 349.91 B: i know i'm i'm i'm a real person [laughter] 

348.88 360.02 A: [laughter] so it's a pleasant surprise i thought you know now how is this robot gonna do interpret whatever it is i have to say and come back with the correct response you know 

349.96 352.30 B: and coincidentally enough 

357.55 358.98 B: right 

359.38 360.56 B: i know 

360.21 364.79 A: i thought technology's good but it isn't that good [laughter] 

362.68 374.23 B: [laughter] it's true well it's also very interesting that you have m._s. because i worked with a woman with m._s. and i would have i would still be working for her right now if i didn't move 

374.50 377.52 B: uh now i'm in the city trying to find work but um 

377.99 380.08 A: where you at what state 

380.13 381.84 B: i'm in new york state 

381.27 382.93 A: (( new york state oh )) 

382.30 383.21 B: yeah 

384.43 393.90 B: so but you're lucky to have your dog because i'm sure that she is a fantastic companion and probably provides a lot of friendship and support in all different ways 

393.82 397.70 A: you know it's it's really surprising how um 

398.01 399.55 A: a service dog 

399.64 403.47 A: um with um their master their owner 

403.42 404.43 B: mhm 

403.81 405.61 A: we've become like a team 

405.63 406.66 B: i bet 

406.29 409.48 A: and and she anticipates my needs 

409.83 412.23 A: uh i find it absolutely 

412.40 413.90 A: phenomenal that 

414.01 418.56 A: um for example i'll stop the wheelchair park it next to 

418.63 421.66 A: the recliner and she'll jump out of bed 

421.77 427.65 A: and um come over and get ready to lift my foot plates for me you know i taught her to do that 

427.79 432.35 A: so she'll anticipate what my my need is going to be at a certain time 

432.37 439.08 A: or um i'll take my cup she'll see me take my cup over to the refrigerator and she'll come over and get ready to open the door 

439.17 440.68 A: of the refrigerator 

439.39 441.20 B: that is so cool 

440.85 442.17 A: isn't that something 

441.87 448.53 B: that is real i had no idea that i mean i knew that dogs were great assistants but i didn't know that they could do that much 

448.17 449.16 A: (( i know )) 

449.16 452.37 B: to really be able to anticipate the next the next move 

449.32 450.26 A: i know 

452.10 455.89 A: yeah or or on days when i'm not keeping well 

453.58 454.14 B: (( [noise] )) 

456.05 458.00 A: um she has like a sixth 

458.11 463.17 A: sense about that and and she seems to be able to um 

459.71 460.91 B: mhm 

464.33 469.71 A: to know that there's something not right with me that day and she'll 

468.97 472.78 B: and so what does she do then she'll come over and give you attention 

472.80 485.13 A: sh- yeah we're attached at the hip i mean she's right there the whole day for example and i'll release her there's a command that's release which means you know be a dog you don't have to work for me right now okay 

485.23 489.56 A: so i'll release her and she'll go um lie down in her bed 

489.63 492.89 A: and i might go into the bathroom to you know just 

493.32 496.46 A: get or arrange or whatever medicine or something 

496.55 503.60 A: and really don't need her in there if i'm gone for more than a couple of minutes she'll come in and check it out 

504.08 505.63 A: where are you what you doing 

505.55 506.85 B: wow 

506.42 508.73 A: and she'll just just stand and look at me 

508.87 522.61 B: i bet it makes her feel good as a dog too to be needed i mean all creatures especially animals like to know that they're not so much cats cats can go on their own but i bet it makes her feel good to be some support as well 

522.22 526.36 A: i don't know i really would like to learn more about animal behavior 

526.50 530.43 A: you know we we went for very extensive training in new york 

530.50 534.75 A: (( this is canine companions they're independent have you ever heard of them )) 

534.91 536.19 B: no i haven't [noise] 

535.78 537.50 A: they're on long island 

537.70 540.80 A: um that's the northeast regional center 

540.67 541.88 B: right 

541.33 542.20 A: um 

542.78 544.46 A: and we went two weeks 

545.03 547.16 A: like very intensive weeks 

547.22 559.26 A: to learn how to you know manage the dog the dogs were perfect we were the dummies at that [laughter] point i think you know we had to learn the commands and you know how how to correct et cetera 

554.21 555.30 B: yeah 

559.31 560.87 A: and um 

561.25 563.22 A: they taught us an awful lot about 

563.23 567.15 A: dogs in general and their behavior but i think it would be 

565.08 565.94 B: (( [noise] )) 

567.28 572.23 A: fascinating to um do further research in that area from here 

572.71 576.90 B: i know 'cause dogs seem seem very different than other animals in that way where 

576.95 577.95 B: um 

578.06 581.81 B: they they seem to respond to another's emotional needs 

581.96 584.60 B: e- e- with some sort of satisfaction 

584.54 586.18 A: yeah yeah how 

584.89 595.98 B: you know um when i remember when i was a kid and i was sad my dog could tell i was sad and it made her feel good to come over and and you know lay by me or whatever it seemed it seemed that way anyway 

595.61 597.54 A: (( old were you when she died )) 

597.72 599.95 B: i guess i was fifteen when she finally
