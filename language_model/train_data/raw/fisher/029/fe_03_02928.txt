150.39 151.65 B: [laughter] 

152.15 153.95 B: [laughter] like i think for

159.42 161.36 A: oh yeah oh so 

160.46 161.86 B: [laughter] 

161.72 164.10 A: i'm we're twin fans here

167.86 173.63 A: atlanta and the twins i mean that was [lipsmack] those were a couple of good series [noise] 

169.19 170.83 B: [laughter] 

173.67 174.48 B: i 

173.78 175.82 A: when uh they played [noise] 

175.90 177.31 B: i know 

176.96 178.00 A: (( [noise] so )) 

178.48 184.05 A: that would be fun to see again the twins got close this year i how did the braves do last year i don't remember [noise] 

182.86 185.85 B: y. you know for some reason um 

187.53 192.57 B: i really couldn't tell you because it's for some reason i i guess because 

193.66 200.52 B: since they have moved we have not really you know been following them 

199.64 201.31 A: [noise] oh uh-huh 

201.05 210.83 B: because you know for spring training they were in the west palm beach area you know the florida area and then they moved to disney world you know 

203.85 204.83 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

205.05 205.86 A: uh-huh 

206.70 207.57 A: sure 

210.09 211.81 A: [noise] oh okay 

210.91 221.82 B: [laughter] so [laughter] and th- uh for some reason they have been going downhill as as far as not being able to get into 

212.18 213.41 A: yeah 

221.87 226.78 B: you know the world series you know to to win it the way that they did 

222.77 224.41 A: [noise] mhm 

226.45 227.52 A: yeah 

228.02 232.07 A: well that goes i- i- it seems like all these teams just kind [noise] of go in 

232.11 233.86 A: cycles i mean they have their 

234.08 236.64 A: period of time that they're just kind of down 

236.74 243.34 B: and i think another reason is because since they have been doing strikes and things um 

243.39 246.64 B: i i think they lost a lot of fans 

246.43 249.25 A: [noise] oh yeah definitely it's not 

249.28 252.06 A: we were watching uh field of dreams 

252.18 254.18 B: oh i loved that movie 

252.59 254.45 A: oh not too long ago 

254.55 260.61 A: and i [noise] love that movie and they and it just kind of reminds you that baseball is not at all what

262.99 264.85 A: you know the guys i mean they would've 

265.16 266.76 A: the would've played for 

267.49 273.89 A: well they did [noise] some of them probably paid just enough to pay their bills and they didn't care they were playing professional baseball 

271.01 272.27 B: (( i know )) 

274.33 275.40 A: and uh 

275.59 280.92 A: it's certain [noise] i i am just amazed at the money [laughter] that they make in baseball 

279.18 281.83 B: [laughter] i know 

281.36 288.17 A: you know i don't begrudge them i mean obviously somebody has the money to pay them but it's just kind of unbelievable that [noise] you can make 

288.35 292.22 A: eight million dollars a year [noise] playing baseball [noise] 

291.66 302.90 B: i know and my son told me he said that the yankees they are they're the most expensive team to own because everyone is a you know
