87.71 95.87 A: [lipsmack] um but that's the only sports that i'm even remotely interested in and i think actually in my opinion they have too many 

96.05 102.14 A: uh programmes on t._v. [laughter] that take up all the channels you know so 

96.76 97.66 B: events 

99.04 100.14 B: yeah 

102.19 104.10 B: now did you ever get into the um

113.93 118.60 B: and um i did happen to go to a a couple of those games 

118.66 120.12 B: it was the um 

120.79 124.76 B: the extreme sports league that that that um 

123.18 124.53 A: oh okay 

124.78 126.29 B: vincent mcmahon put on 

127.00 128.45 B: the the wrestling guy 

129.50 136.74 A: oh yeah vincent man yeah in fact it's funny that you said that 'cause my husband's in the bedroom watching his wrestling now 

136.39 137.51 B: (( oh yeah )) 

137.07 146.19 A: and i heard vincent man a little while ago so [laughter] he's into that and he's also into football but that's about the only things you know we do so 

139.20 140.06 B: yeah 

140.88 141.76 B: uh 

146.30 150.20 B: i like football but only when i can go and watch it my son plays it so 

150.08 152.30 A: oh really ah 

150.74 151.92 B: yeah 

152.55 155.01 B: (( but um not very )) 

155.44 156.42 B: (( um )) 

156.28 159.39 A: well i think they earn entirely too much money what do you think 

159.21 160.72 B: (( oh yeah definitely )) 

160.10 161.71 A: [laughter] 

160.86 167.37 B: definitely but you know what no actually actually i don't because i'm uh uh the wear and tear that it does on the body 

167.81 169.49 B: that's a that's a lot 

169.11 170.61 A: well that's true 

169.86 172.17 B: replaces the knees and the hips and the 

172.26 180.00 B: the different joints and you know they have to go through and and look at joe namath and how bad you know he's gone through what two pairs of knees so far 

180.92 182.56 A: well i guess what 

183.10 186.24 A: irritates me about their pay is that um 

186.67 188.73 A: my son is in the military 

188.52 189.69 B: yeah 

189.10 202.75 A: and you know they make like fourteen thousand dollars a year and he's out there putting his life on the line you know every day so [laughter] when you compare that with six million dollars you know it's like um there's something ain't right here [noise] 

192.40 193.50 B: right and 

194.90 195.99 B: i understand 

200.31 201.27 B: yeah 

202.73 204.09 B: i understand that 

204.48 205.70 A: but uh 

204.88 206.05 B: what branch 

206.54 214.34 A: but i think that uh [noise] a lot of the players are just spoiled and you know they're not going to do anything unless they get all that [noise] money and 

213.77 217.42 B: oh definitely they're they're they are spoilt and that's that's you know 

217.58 223.50 A: yeah which in turns you know affects us consumers that you know may wanna pay for a game or whatever and 

224.02 225.73 A: it's outrageous so 

226.34 228.39 A: i don't know that's just my opinion on it 

228.26 229.91 B: (( i agree i have )) 

229.28 230.76 A: where are you from kathy 

230.43 231.50 B: california 

231.33 232.13 A: where

234.78 237.81 B: misery huh [laughter] so you didn't get any of the tornados 

238.04 247.73 A: no thank goodness and it was weird because i had some uh some jobs that i was supposed to do up there 'cause i do like retail merchandising and stuff 

247.32 248.09 B: uh-huh 

247.75 255.23 A: and i was supposed to do some jobs up there and then i decided i don't know i guess i listened to my women's intuition because i decided 

255.28 261.90 A: to just go on home and submit some reports because i didn't feel like driving any further and boy i'm glad i didn't so 

261.96 263.80 B: yeah that would not have been a good thing 

263.49 266.68 A: yeah 'cause i've in fact i have several 

266.85 273.51 A: job projects there you know on a weekly basis and i don't even know right now what i can get into and what i can't so 

273.38 273.95 B: (( [noise] ))
