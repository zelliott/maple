367.98 371.62 A: 'cause i guess she gets paid for a certain number of people for signing up a certain number of 

371.15 376.77 B: right right i guess that's kind of how i got started in it somebody thought well you know 

376.87 382.71 B: and which is good you know we're college students and it's nice to be able to have some extra change [laughter] so

442.66 446.08 B: [laughter] right 

444.73 450.18 A: (( the journal of psycho social psycho babble or something [laughter] )) 

448.64 460.53 B: right right but i was in one chatroom and it looked like someone that um had talked to somebody else's daughter without even realising it and just in conversation 

460.36 464.59 B: they found out that the two of them had met and i thought that is pretty nice 

460.62 461.43 A: oh 

462.73 472.65 A: [noise] oh wow that is pretty cool how they were [noise] able to figure that out 'cause there must be there must be hundreds of people participat- if not thousands participating in this thing

485.90 487.18 A: (( oh yeah )) 

486.64 492.84 B: you move from place to place and then you look up and you're in the grocery store and there's your old neighbor from ten years ago 

492.10 494.28 A: [laughter] 

493.66 494.59 B: so 

494.68 509.57 A: yeah it's funny how that happens i mean i i guess i moved i moved a fair amount in my life not that much not as much as i would in the military but that still even happens to me literally in the grocery store run into somebody that i went to high school with twenty years ago [laughter] you know 

496.21 497.16 B: yeah

568.60 569.76 B: yeah 

568.87 581.97 A: i guess it's kind of this i guess because i i don't do the the chatrooms on the internet i don't have that experience much of talking to complete strangers which [laughter] probably a lot of people do nowadays 

577.72 579.62 B: right right 

581.67 589.40 B: [mn] really they do it it's amazing and you'd think they've known each other for years and they've just talked for a couple of minutes [laughter] 

588.20 594.77 A: right yeah people can really connect and click with somebody who's [sigh] you know may be very very different from themselves 

595.07 599.95 B: right because you have nothing else to go on other than your likes or your differen-
