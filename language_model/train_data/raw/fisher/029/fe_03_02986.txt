206.97 216.72 B: i mean it was okay i mean i've never really grown up with pets like my parents didn't allow me to have pets when i was growing up i was i was an only child so 

213.81 215.53 A: [laughter] 

216.78 228.87 B: they decided it was too much of a hassle um an- and my parents were both career people so they spent very little time at home so i didn't really have pets so i kind of i was a late bloomer in terms of pets 

228.42 229.72 A: [laughter] 

229.01 231.41 B: so i i had pets in my 

231.77 234.99 B: [lipsmack] like mid twenties my first pets were 

235.39 242.54 B: like hamsters and they were they were very cute but they've got such a short life span i mean like two or three years and 

242.10 246.90 A: yeah they do [laughter] [laughter] 

242.99 248.07 B: and i'm like oh oh no just when you start like you know 

248.67 253.49 B: having fun with them and getting to know them 'cause they they all i think all animals have like 

253.59 266.30 B: individual personalities and and and then they're gone you know it's like oh okay but um it was a it was a good diversion it was definitely relieved a lot of stress and you know 

257.85 259.82 A: [noise] yeah [noise] 

266.87 275.21 B: it was it was fun to have them um i had roommate too she kinda took care of 'em more than i did i just kinda played with them so um 

274.29 275.39 A: (( [noise] )) 

275.37 277.59 B: i mean i'm sure if i you know i mean i'm 

277.84 279.24 B: still i'm i'm 

279.31 284.17 B: single and i'm not married and i don't have children and um 

284.43 295.80 B: i guess eventually down the road i mean i spend most of time at work anyway so i guess when i'm ready to sort of settle down and and have kids i'm [laughter] sure i'll have some more pets 

292.85 293.81 A: [laughter] 

295.31 297.33 A: [noise] [laughter] yeah 

296.72 301.86 B: 'cause it's it's hard i mean i mean did you have pets before you had children 

298.11 299.61 A: (( [noise] )) 

302.07 304.85 A: um well no not 

304.86 307.06 A: [noise] only when i was growing up i did 

306.36 307.72 B: yeah yeah

310.11 311.30 B: yeah 

317.79 318.86 B: mhm 

318.91 322.52 A: and once you have kids you might as well get pets [laughter] [noise] 

321.46 336.20 B: 'cause you're all you know you're at home and it's kinda fun and you're like okay it's like you take children take care of pets it's okay right as opposed to if you're kinda single and you're like okay i need to do this i need to go there i can't oh now i've gotta find a pet sitter or you know so 

327.85 329.58 A: yeah
