309.92 314.02 A: um my girlfriend is a sportscaster for e._s._p._n. 

314.16 320.07 A: [laughter] and i've never seen her on television so i guess we don't watch enough sports

339.35 349.16 A: like i make sure that i know something that's going on so that if someone mentions it i don't need to know every play no ones every going to quiz you but before you go into a meeting 

339.38 340.36 B: oh 

349.13 358.85 A: so that i'm not disadvantaged in some respects for their like who won last night did you see that game did you see the score do you know who's playing tonight i'm always careful about that 

358.65 361.09 B: wow that's really a smart thing to do 

361.49 366.05 A: yeah women in business it's a really yes it's a good thing 

361.63 363.68 B: (( have you noticed that it helps you out ))

375.78 386.28 A: i'm i'm just cognizant of that and i know that these you know [mn] you just don't want to start off 'cause you know the the uh most inappropriate question and i think sometimes people 

386.61 389.70 A: men especially qualify um 

389.78 390.77 A: someone 

390.80 394.49 A: that they're in front of by asking a question like that to sink them 

394.62 395.97 B: definitely

400.17 400.97 A: yeah 

401.72 416.13 A: [laughter] oh really you didn't think about it [laughter] i grab the page or i put on the sports radio for a good ten minutes if i need to if i'm going to be in meetings or in and out of uh client offices all day 

401.87 402.75 B: um

431.66 441.31 B: um but then like i'm a junior this year so i've kind of eased off of that but actually i've never been to the basketball like a lot of people have

455.06 457.74 A: yeah i'm not i'm not big on watching that either 

460.66 471.60 A: [laughter] yeah that's a that's a riot now i think i i you know i don't know i know a lot of girls really do follow sports more than i do i would say where would you put yourself if you had to categorize 

473.49 475.88 B: (( [mn] if like if i found myself )) 

474.69 478.34 A: yeah in the top four tiles of the on the bottom core top 

479.11 487.59 B: um i would probably say somewhere towards the middle but i know a li- a little a lot more than most women do about like football 

487.86 488.84 A: really 

488.22 496.25 B: but could yeah 'cause i really like football and soccer so i'm pretty knowledgeable about those but other than that i don't know anything 

498.06 500.96 A: yeah i'm not i'm not very knowledgeable about that either 

501.54 504.61 B: oh but you know about more about basketball 

503.88 505.75 A: the last uh the last 

504.83 508.15 B: you know about um baseball i'm sorry than most people do 

507.56 511.66 A: baseball i do i mean i know that i it's pretty 

511.83 513.38 A: it's pretty basic 

514.22 517.30 A: it's pretty basic for baseball um 

517.69 526.75 A: yeah i've always got like trivia i avoid [laughter] i avoid that 'cause what i don't know know really olympics didn't you did you watch them 

527.18 534.75 B: um no i haven't recently when i was younger i used to watch them like faithfully but i i haven't actually seen 

534.77 536.77 B: the olympics in some time 

537.97 548.07 B: but i used to watch them faithfully but i do i like the track part of the summer olympics and i like figure skating a lot in the winter olympics

574.45 577.33 B: i mean how it's like hyped up before the 

577.79 579.27 B: i think that's cool 

579.41 584.27 B: and i like seeing the same people that used to be in it like the penn relays then you see them there so it's fun 

584.28 584.89 B: [noise]
