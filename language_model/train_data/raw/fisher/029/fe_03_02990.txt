257.42 259.76 A: it's going pretty well actually 

258.58 261.39 B: if it were cats i don't think i would have much to say

263.20 264.29 B: yeah 

263.57 265.92 A: i don't think that they're 

264.54 272.32 B: my ah my parents would never allow me to have a a pet when i was growing up except for a fish a goldfish 

271.34 272.71 A: (( oh why is that )) 

272.39 281.62 B: oh they were really weird and so i had to i had fish but you know then i didn't really take care of them very well so they'd always be floating when i got home from school 

281.49 282.76 A: right 

281.96 285.52 B: yeah on the top of the water there and ah it's was kind 

284.11 292.03 A: well my parents always allowed me to have a dog never any cats and not not not only the fact that i was allergic but they just they smell 

291.75 293.17 B: yeah

329.93 333.94 A: well no actually we had found all of them except for this one

337.21 338.84 B: yeah oh no 

337.86 342.06 A: and we put him in the cage and they ate him i guess because he was sick or whatever 

341.56 345.26 B: oh no please did you watch them eat it 

342.55 344.51 A: yes they ate him so we got 

344.69 352.59 A: well we didn't we didn't see it we come back a while later and they had eaten him yeah and we got rid of them we were like oh no this is ridiculous

373.78 374.67 A: (( i )) 

376.71 386.11 A: i was wondering i wondered that too i i said the only reason i would think they would eat it because they didn't eat each other any other time but that one was sick so i said maybe they did it 

382.56 383.81 B: (( know no )) 

384.31 388.87 B: you know maybe it's almost nature saying let's get rid of this sick one you know or
