78.31 86.10 A: and then all my friends always complain that when the go away on a vacation you know [noise] they have to board it and it's just not worth it 

78.66 79.66 B: oh 

84.26 85.38 B: mhm 

86.26 87.12 B: mhm 

86.53 88.67 A: all the aggravation so 

88.88 90.86 A: did you have a pet growing up 

91.04 97.50 B: yeah um actually i had a lot of pets i had like uh a couple of parakeets 

97.70 101.17 B: and then i had um guinea pigs 

101.46 106.07 B: and then i also had a dog um we had a a rottweiler 

107.28 115.25 B: and um yeah and when i moved out you know like the birds died and so the guinea pigs we gave away 

115.42 122.77 B: and then the dog my mom kept it and i would love to have another one but um i'm just not allowed to so 

122.70 126.14 A: well maybe when you move from there one day you'll be able to 

126.01 130.59 B: yeah yeah 'cause i really like them i'm really into dogs especially 

130.73 135.82 A: we had a cockatiel before i had any of my kids wh- and um 

134.62 135.65 B: mhm 

135.93 138.47 A: he got very sick like out of the blue 

138.43 139.16 B: (( [noise] )) 

138.49 144.17 A: and um he pas- you know he just passed away it was very odd because we had no 

144.75 152.96 A: you know we had no idea that he was sick he we just like the morning he woke up and that was that it was very odd and another time he was very ill 

152.89 163.91 A: and you know he went to an animal hospital and everything and he was fine it was just so strange that one morning we just woke up and he wasn't there any more my husband was very attached to him 

164.25 166.17 B: (( [noise] oh [noise] )) 

164.42 172.17 A: and so he grew up with a cockatiel and he only wanted one and at least that's like not so much work so 

171.75 172.88 B: mhm 

172.25 176.76 A: you know we had one for a while i guess we almost had it for like two years 

176.77 177.67 B: uh-huh 

178.10 188.19 A: he was he was cute he was cute but he used to li- he used to come out if we took him out of the cage he would fly to like this video rack and he would chew like on all the video boxes 

180.88 181.79 B: uh-huh 

188.10 190.02 B: really 

189.22 190.29 A: (( so it was )) 

190.27 204.70 A: it was pretty funny and i'd never had a pet growing up really i had my fish also and that's it that's probably why i don't like it that's probably why i don't wanna be bothered like you said you you grew up with a dog and you want one like we never had it 

193.98 194.99 B: oh no 

201.67 202.67 B: mhm 

204.74 215.59 A: so i guess i'm just used to not having it and my kids are very afraid if they go to somebody else- else's house especially my daughter like if they have a dog 

213.50 216.21 B: oh really and they have pets 

215.65 229.02 A: it it could be the smallest dog you've ever seen and my next door neighbor has a little poodle and down the block they have a a little mutt and they're so tiny i mean they only come up to like your ankles and they're very cute 

226.16 226.76 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

228.90 230.41 B: mhm 

229.01 236.23 A: and she's so afraid of them even if they you know come out on leash she just won't go near them 

236.29 238.42 B: [noise] really that's that's 

238.55 239.78 B: wow 

239.02 245.38 A: isn't that odd and it it's not like anything's ever happened to her like at all she just doesn't like them 

240.45 241.66 B: yeah it's kinda 

245.60 246.87 A: so um 

246.04 247.61 B: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

247.38 258.40 A: she really doesn't like them if they're out on the leash she would purposely like cross the street and wait for the bus on the other side of the block so that when she goes to school she doesn't have to be near the dog 

258.58 261.87 A: and the dog is still on a leash you know [laughter] 

258.61 260.12 B: (( really )) 

261.89 267.51 A: (( an- yeah she's very nervous very nervous so it's odd )) 

262.24 263.42 B: oh 

267.69 268.64 A: you know 

267.72 276.03 B: yeah it is because most people that i know especially kids um you know they usually are not afraid of dogs 

274.89 285.50 A: they wanna go up to them especially like you know i can see her being nervous if it was a big one like you know a golden retriever or something like that but they're very tiny 

276.32 277.79 B: yeah yeah 

283.20 284.26 B: mhm 

286.17 296.86 A: so she's very you know very nervous the fact that she won't go to somebody's house for a play date or anything if they have a dog they have to come here [laughter] yeah 

286.37 287.25 B: oh 

294.72 300.29 B: oh my god [laughter] oh so i guess you will never get one then [laughter] 

298.74 300.98 A: no i'm not gonna get one 

300.55 301.86 B: [laughter] 

301.16 307.38 A: my my little four year old son says that he wants one and i said you know we can't get one because 

307.62 309.88 A: you know his sister's afraid of it 

310.02 311.25 A: so uh 

311.61 320.09 A: he he goes that he'll just keep it in his room [laughter] he thinks that he can just keep a dog in his room he has no idea it's very funny 

315.30 316.41 B: oh 

317.80 319.24 B: (( no no no )) 

319.76 326.86 B: i'm just um it's just uh the only thing where i would hesitate to get one it just it it requires quite some time 

326.59 327.76 A: right 

327.51 340.44 B: and then it also requires quite some money so i think in order to actually get a pet like a dog um 'cause a a dog is kinda like a high maintenance pet you know compared to like a cat or a rabbit or something 

340.11 341.35 A: right 

341.00 348.10 B: so i think um i should be prepared financially and then also you know time wise otherwise i shouldn't 

346.52 349.78 A: right it's a lot of responsibility it's like a child 

348.62 349.69 B: yeah 

350.09 352.17 A: it's exactly like a child 

352.25 363.71 A: you really need the time for it especially in the beginning when they're getting accustomed to everything you know you don't wanna my other friend just got one and she's like every time she used to leave the house in the beginning 

352.72 354.45 B: [noise] 

358.54 359.58 B: [noise] 

363.54 364.39 B: mhm 

363.68 368.72 A: that he would chew up all their stuff and she had to get a trainer 

367.07 367.97 B: uh-huh 

368.90 372.00 A: and uh they rescued from a from 

371.84 383.58 A: the the animal shelter it was a wee small dog but it's like a mass of cute and he would chew on like everything the second that they walked out of the house because he missed everyone 

383.37 393.00 A: and it she you know i said to her you're gonna have to stay home for like a week or so you know and then start going like slow like five minutes out of the house and then ten minutes out 

387.94 389.15 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

392.79 400.27 A: like doing quick so she had to start doing quick errands and then coming back to show him that he was she was always coming back 

399.92 400.87 B: uh-huh 

400.37 410.02 A: and um but he's he's such a big dog he's really big now i don't know he i think it's just like a big mack but they're still trying to train him 

410.39 412.48 A: he likes to sit up on the furniture 

412.50 419.83 A: and she says it's a lot of work and it's very expensive and he's very picky with the type of food [noise] 

417.05 419.38 B: [noise] yeah that's like if they 

419.77 430.76 B: they have um you know like if they break their legs or something like that you have to take 'em in for surgery and that like easily runs up like a thousand dollars you know with 

424.14 425.12 A: right 

429.88 430.79 A: [mn] he just 

430.83 440.73 A: that just happened to her puppy actually she well he he didn't break his leg but he sprained a ligament and um he was hop- 

440.73 455.69 A: you know like hobbling practically and she said at first she didn't want to take him in because she knew it would be expensive but you you know and that she just thought it was something that was swollen and it would go down but um you know he was hobbling and whimpering 

450.10 453.57 B: mhm [noise] 

454.01 455.20 B: (( [noise] )) 

456.21 468.78 A: and she did bring him in and it cost her a fortune and she said you know and it has to just repair itself so he's all bandaged up and she's like it's worse she should have just left on her own 

456.24 457.19 B: yeah 

463.50 465.08 B: (( [noise] )) 

466.73 468.97 B: (( [noise] )) 

468.76 474.66 A: to heal and her daughter you know it doesn't help that like when her daughter's in school he'll relax and he'll rest 

469.12 470.84 B: [noise] 

471.31 487.24 B: (( [noise] )) 

475.14 482.26 A: but when her daughter comes home from school all she wants to do all the dog wants to do is like get play with her daughter 

483.19 484.05 A: so 

484.59 486.56 A: it's getting very staticy 

487.04 495.12 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] uh-huh [noise] [noise] excuse me [noise] it's got better now )) 

488.63 493.41 A: can you hear me i have like static in my uh connection oh it got it got better 

494.62 495.55 A: (( yes )) 

495.63 502.83 B: 'cause i was somewhere and it was kinda windy here i'm sorry that's probably what it was so the wind was kinda blowing into the earpiece 

503.16 505.02 B: but now i'm back [laughter] 

504.62 506.31 A: (( what city you in )) 

506.45 514.06 B: um la [noise] [noise] oh okay so all the way [laughter] all the way 

508.15 510.44 A: (( oh really and i'm in new york )) 

512.47 514.89 A: i'm i'm in new york yes 

514.28 515.32 B: yeah 

515.19 516.09 A: yeah 

515.51 528.03 B: and um have you ever [noise] like what do you think about like wild pets like [noise] snakes and stuff like that [noise] no me neither [noise] [noise] 

520.39 528.53 A: i don't i don't like that at all i would never wanna keep that in my kids 'cause what if it ever got out you'd be freaking out like 

528.77 530.67 A: you don't know where they go 

530.90 544.85 B: yeah yeah i think that most people buy it and then they buy it i don't know because they think it's cool or hip and then after like three or four months they decide they don't want it so it's really unfair for the pet i think yeah 

532.52 533.63 A: and i hate 

541.31 542.40 A: right 

543.61 551.10 A: that just had that here in new york it was in the newspapers in new york city some people i think had an alligator as a pet 

550.69 552.40 B: (( [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

551.01 559.06 A: and then it got to big and out of control for them and they let it go in in central park they found an alligator 

554.37 555.31 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

559.12 561.57 A: [laughter] you know and it i mean 

559.34 560.76 B: (( oh [noise] )) 

561.79 568.80 A: it's gotta be because it was a pet it's just you know it got it's not meant to be as a pet and then and 

568.15 570.17 B: i know [noise] 

568.63 581.75 A: and then they're they're risking their lives and then well not only themselves but now the poor alligator is like out of his you know habitat it's amazing i i hope you know they picked them up and they rescued him 

581.93 584.39 A: so they didn't say what they were gonna do with it though 

583.08 588.88 B: yeah that's what i think they do with snakes and alligators and stuff like that people buy because i don't know 

588.71 599.95 B: because they're crazy because they think it's like cool or something but they don't really wanna you know have it like they just think it's like i don't know fashionable or something and then after a while they don't want it anymore and they get 

595.51 596.62 A: right
