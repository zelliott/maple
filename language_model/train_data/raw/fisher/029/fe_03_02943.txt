73.91 82.61 B: yeah see i still i still kind of root for them but i don't watch basketball as much as i used to like [noise] before the strike 

81.99 83.89 A: yeah 

82.50 96.55 B: a few years ago i was like a really big basketball fan and then i don't know i just got tired of the complaining oh i only make sixty million dollars a year like if i made sixty thousand dollars a year i'd be set [noise] that would be just fine 

90.59 91.79 A: (( yeah i know )) 

94.71 96.34 A: (( i uh )) 

96.41 105.73 A: i know but i'll tell ya basketball's exciting especially now with the playoffs i mean but if you watch the last five minutes you really watch the whole end the whole game end of the game you know what i mean 

100.78 101.92 B: yeah 

104.87 111.36 B: and that's the other thing i always flip to the last part of the game and you know you go talk about stuff that happened 

110.44 113.11 A: [noise] right right 

111.74 114.65 B: so you see who wins and you get to go [laughter] 

114.08 123.38 A: but i do like basketball much better than hockey i mean i mean just the action and the plays and then i like uh uh football of course the best 

116.93 118.00 B: (( yeah )) 

124.28 128.48 B: [noise] yeah i so uh my biggest thing is football i actually 

124.74 126.43 A: (( overall )) 

128.56 142.13 B: did i had no clue i hated it until i was about in eighth grade and our teacher we had a really big football in our in my high school like they would structure classes around football games 

132.74 133.97 A: oh 

141.72 143.14 A: right i see 

142.18 152.44 B: but we would get out early to watch the football games the home games and then we went to state championships you know we had like two hours of school and then school let out for us to go the games 

146.35 148.21 A: right 

148.46 149.34 A: (( oh )) 

152.25 154.05 A: right 

152.31 159.88 B: it was great but um she was like well you have to understand football because football's a really big tradition in our school and so we did a unit 

159.88 172.07 B: on football and we had to learn how to play and learn the strategy of the game and all that kind of stuff so now once i finally understood it i was like oh [noise] so i used it all the time and then i got to college 

172.25 183.71 B: and it just started i was partying more than anything else so usually i was sleeping in my freshman year so i stopped watching [noise] it 'cause [laughter] i was so tired at the time that the game was on 

183.18 184.51 A: (( right yeah )) 

183.82 185.98 B: you know i couldn't see it and then [noise] 

185.08 196.24 A: yeah but after watching football and basketball and hockey if you watch hockey and then you turn on baseball it's so slow moving compared until you get used to it you know what i mean 

195.38 199.69 B: yeah i can't stand it like [noise] my great grandmother 

199.71 204.91 B: you know she used to love watching baseball 'cause we're from georgia she was the biggest 

205.12 206.71 B: um braves fan 

205.93 209.19 A: atlanta braves fan huh yeah 

207.20 213.67 B: oh yeah she [noise] you couldn't touch the t._v. she was like no my game is on [laughter] and we'd be like granny but 

212.90 222.56 A: well you know baseball's good when it comes to som- just some games but you know to sit through the whole game is kinda tough sometimes unless it's uh maybe a high scoring game and things like that 

218.17 219.32 B: yeah 

219.33 222.25 B: (( well who else i know yeah )) 

222.28 226.06 B: (( when [noise] the world series comes on you know i'll i'll check in and watch 'em for fun )) 

225.13 233.89 A: and baseball's every day don't forget and football's only once a week and and builds the excitement up a little bit more in football 

229.09 230.62 B: exactly
