96.07 97.87 A: yeah 

97.96 102.55 A: so i guess they had like didn't have a team for a while so that was kinda hard on browns' fans 

102.15 108.33 B: oh that's my daughter's fiance is just like bonkers about sports in general but he loves the browns 

108.42 112.59 B: and that's what he said he said he just was so upset when they didn't have a team 

112.84 113.90 A: yeah 

113.32 119.78 B: well really i was too because you know the the rivalry between pittsburgh and and cleveland was 

119.81 121.63 B: was a really big thing 

121.89 129.91 B: so when when cleveland was gone we really didn't have anyone you know with that kind of a rivalry going on 

131.09 136.68 A: yeah you know around here it's more i don't know college college sports seem to be more

145.89 149.43 B: well you know i live in columbus so you can imagine 

149.62 150.77 A: yeah 

150.20 156.30 B: you know buckeyes were just and they were phenomenal this year in football i mean 

154.59 155.92 A: yeah i was i was 

156.41 157.79 B: who would have thought 

157.80 166.18 A: yeah especially like miami was so good i think their quarterback was like thirty forty one or something 

158.68 159.34 B: i 

165.58 166.87 B: wow 

166.71 169.38 A: with starting games and that was like his second loss in like 

169.83 171.93 A: four years or something [laughter] 

170.55 177.74 B: [laughter] i'm i was yeah i was really surprised each game i would be like okay

181.48 182.80 A: yeah 

182.44 185.08 B: i think i like you know i've gotten kind of 

185.41 187.13 B: turned off of um 

188.70 197.21 B: professional base- football and basket- especially basketball 'cause it seems like the younger guys have come in and 

193.56 194.43 A: yeah 

197.04 197.86 A: [noise] 

199.02 202.85 B: just a lot of you know how much money can you make and 

202.10 203.88 A: yeah 

203.19 205.87 B: doesn't seem to have the same caliber 

206.52 208.06 B: of you know 

208.31 209.26 B: people 

209.13 211.04 A: [noise] yeah they have some 

209.77 211.66 B: or maybe i'm just getting old 

211.57 217.35 A: yeah they have some good players coming up like the lebron james kid and all that scandal about 

216.11 218.11 B: oh yeah 

218.06 219.55 A: that's crazy 

219.02 221.21 B: the one whose mother bought him a hummer 

221.06 224.09 A: yeah and they they live in the project and 

221.55 222.62 B: yeah 

223.42 224.87 B: and he has a hummer 

224.76 228.07 A: and he's practised with cleveland already i guess 

227.48 228.80 B: oh really 

228.54 238.12 A: yeah like a lot of people think that um this year they might like be doing bad like the cows they might be doing bad on purpose just so they can get a first draft pick 

237.52 239.19 B: oh okay 

240.42 245.19 B: how did they do bad last year as well 'cause i don't really follow the cows very much 

245.49 247.63 A: um i'm not really sure 

247.77 258.81 A: i know they they did kinda bad last year but i think like they're they're just doing terrible this year and i i think that they're like supposedly they shouldn't be doing that bad it's just 

257.81 260.85 B: okay so maybe they are trying to get a first round 

260.62 261.82 A: yeah 

261.25 262.14 B: huh 

262.92 270.48 B: now this young man this lebron james he will go pro this year won't he i mean he's not even gonna attempt college 

270.15 283.32 A: i'm pretty sure he will i think actually he's ineligible to play basketball in college because i think he's like played in like more than two all star games or something i think that makes you ineligible for like a year of college ball or something i'm not sure 

271.40 272.42 B: yeah 

280.56 281.44 B: (( oh )) 

282.25 285.00 B: oh does it okay i didn't know that 

286.26 294.02 A: so yeah that's been like a big deal actually my school my school played his school like last year at like in the state 

288.74 289.71 B: yeah 'cause 

293.87 294.74 B: uh-huh 

294.54 298.11 A: and so i went and like actually saw him playing it was 

297.81 304.94 B: well i saw him they had they televised which you know i mean they do not really televise high school games that much 

304.97 313.37 B: and they did televise one of one of his games and it wasn't like a state game it was it was just because it was him 

305.04 305.84 A: yeah 

313.42 314.56 A: yeah 

314.01 318.39 B: and my daughter called me up because her and her fiance had been talking about him 

318.47 325.43 B: and she called me up and told me to turn it on you know and he was phenomenal and he was really good for a kid for a young man 

325.73 328.55 A: he's been on he's been on t._v. so much 

328.18 330.67 B: yeah so i was just hoping that you know 

332.70 338.04 B: he seems to have a lot of other problems and i'm just kinda hoping that you know with with 

338.10 343.85 B: going and being on television and with all of the notoriety and all the things that come with that 

344.07 348.37 B: that he's able to keep his head on straight 'cause he's so young 

349.35 350.30 A: yeah 

349.38 352.31 B: and that's a lot of pressure to put on a young kid 

352.20 353.91 A: yeah 

353.99 358.62 B: i mean i think coby was able to do it because his parents were right there beside him 

358.65 359.73 A: mhm 

359.12 361.40 B: you know even when he went pro 

361.62 365.19 B: he they were still right there and kind kept him you know 

365.85 370.21 B: in the right direction 'cause i can you imagine having millions of dollars 

369.49 371.46 A: uh-huh yeah i 

370.62 372.98 B: and being eighteen [mn] 

372.20 373.02 A: (( yeah it'd )) 

373.04 374.39 A: be pretty nice 

373.96 382.67 B: yeah oh well yeah if you if you had someone who could you know maybe not keep you from going off to something that was really not good 

382.48 384.61 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

384.45 387.27 B: so you know i'm hoping that you know that 

388.33 393.74 B: that his mother will do that even though she did buy him a hummer which i thought was really weird 

393.70 400.54 A: yeah he got he got a lot of fl- attention for that a lot of bad attention about that 

399.36 408.82 B: that's what i that's what i'm saying what was she thinking this is not the attention you would want for this child at this stag- at this stage of his game 

408.70 409.76 A: yeah 

409.24 411.68 B: you wouldn't want all that negativity 

412.24 415.17 B: that's why i'm wondering you know i hope i hope she can 

415.33 419.89 B: give him the right direction when it's involving millions of dollars 

419.99 421.41 A: yeah 

422.39 426.15 B: 'cause you know going from from the project 

427.39 430.51 B: to having that might be a little overwhelming 

429.91 433.55 A: [noise] yeah and right from high school to like pro basketball 

433.07 438.39 B: right and from the project to what millions of dollars wow 

437.17 438.27 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

440.05 442.98 B: that just might make anybody have a real problem 

445.65 449.30 B: so you say you like what did you say um 

448.68 450.52 A: i like soccer too 

449.83 450.83 B: soccer 

450.78 457.21 A: and another sport they don't they don't show it that much on t._v. but [noise] i like i wrestled in high school and i like wrestling 

456.64 457.88 B: okay 

458.31 463.36 B: um no they they don't show soccer very much because i don't see it very often 

463.53 470.76 B: um i don't know that much about it my daughter played soccer when she was in high school but i mean that still doesn't help me much 

463.78 464.79 A: yeah 

470.90 471.81 B: um 

471.05 471.63 A: (( mhm )) 

472.28 476.14 B: 'cause she just had such a problem with hitting the ball with her head 

476.35 479.07 B: (( she kept saying but it's gonna mess up my hair )) 

478.83 479.82 A: [laughter] 

479.28 483.33 B: and her coach kept saying i don't care about your hair [laughter] 

483.24 489.72 A: yeah i think i think it's i i don't know most sports that they do televise are i don't know they 

489.83 497.53 A: maybe if you don't like like it particular or something i i think sometimes it's fun to watch just because of the intensity and like of the um 

497.70 499.54 A: the type of athletes they have 

499.30 506.94 B: yeah oh exactly you could really appreciate that just like now i did watch some soccer last year but it wasn't here in the united states 

507.25 508.49 B: it was 

507.41 508.18 A: yeah 

509.02 518.14 B: i don't know if it was in england or if it was in europe but it was what is the big soccer thing i mean they have like a finals or 

518.20 519.33 A: the world cup 

518.58 522.99 B: a cup or something like that yeah it was one i was watching one of those games 

522.84 523.88 A: yeah 

523.34 529.31 B: and i was kind of amazed at the ability because it didn't look anything like what my daughter did 

529.78 530.96 A: mhm 

530.38 536.27 B: you know there was they it'd would take them a lot of a lot of sports ability to be able to do that 

535.72 540.13 A: yeah those people they can run so fast and they can kick the ball so far [laughter] i mean it looks easy 

539.83 541.45 B: yeah 

540.71 545.44 A: 'cause you don't realize like how big those fields are and it just looks they make it easy 

545.16 547.97 B: that's just like i've watched some um 

549.27 553.33 B: [sigh] i guess volleyball still called volleyball i guess
