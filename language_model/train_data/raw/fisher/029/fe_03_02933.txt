207.77 209.01 B: wherever it was 

209.72 218.85 B: i loved the ice skating but the whole the whole thing and the summer ones too the summer ones i always am glued to the gymnastics which is always really beautiful 

217.01 218.69 A: (( yeah )) 

219.03 223.72 B: and the winter ones there's the ice skating there's the ski jumps which are amazing 

224.24 229.04 B: you know it's it's really watching those people whip down the mountain is pretty awesome 

228.81 231.15 A: it is and the bobsled is fun 

230.62 236.90 B: yeah the bob sled yeah and this year they uh were whatever the last olympics that was actually 

237.34 240.42 B: [noise] a lot of drama about that do you remember that 

240.61 243.72 B: with the bobsled with the women's bob sled 

240.71 241.64 A: (( um )) 

243.17 245.30 A: no that one i don't remember 

244.20 246.25 B: yeah it was there [noise] because 

248.26 253.63 B: i guess the the person who's sort of in control of the bobsled and then there's the 

254.54 255.98 A: oh that's right 

254.64 259.19 B: back person right who is supposed to be like the push off person 

256.00 258.57 A: right they kicked somebody off the team 

258.74 259.66 A: uh-huh 

259.37 261.84 B: and this one girl who was 

262.46 270.81 B: supposed to be really talented in her sports switched her partner basically ditched her long time partner and took somebody else on at the last minute 

270.39 272.10 A: i remember that now 

271.01 279.25 B: who she thought was better and then they totally lost and it was [noise] it i think it it all just reflected really badly on her 

278.80 280.69 A: yeah 

279.34 286.85 B: 'cause she had [noise] she was proven to have no loyalty and she still lost [laughter] yeah well that was like a whole big soap opera 

283.10 284.93 A: (( yeah that's )) 

286.51 287.84 A: that was a shame 

287.89 289.79 B: yeah it kind of was but 

290.02 295.73 B: i don't know it's one of those things where if she'd won that kind of would have seemed like a shame too you know 

295.42 296.53 A: mhm 

295.87 299.49 B: like no loyalty got rewarded or something 

298.87 299.98 A: right 

300.18 308.81 B: but that was um yeah that was a big drama normally i don't think i i relate that much or think that much about the bobsledding but that's [laughter] how i see it 

308.78 323.42 B: and that the guys the skiing guys were awfully dynamic and cute that time i thought wasn't that like bodie millar right well he was he was great i mean a great athlete and like a charismatic guy as i remember 

314.30 316.41 A: [laughter] 

317.25 318.11 A: uh-huh 

323.42 329.34 A: well in the summer olympics i like to watch the gymnastics like you [noise] and then i'll i'll watch the swimming 

327.00 328.63 B: mhm 

329.70 331.51 A: love to watch the swimming 

329.79 330.79 B: yeah 

331.02 332.76 B: yeah that's beautiful too 

331.64 334.25 A: just incredible to me how fast i mean 

334.74 344.54 A: you know they measure their time in tenths and hundredths of seconds and i'm always amazed they can declare somebody a winner sometimes they're so close 

341.86 346.61 B: [noise] yeah i mean it can be almost heart breaking for the other people 

345.18 346.97 A: yeah 

346.71 348.05 B: [noise] yeah that's kind of 

348.11 356.29 B: it's really intense [noise] [mn] i was actually speaking of being on the phone i was just on the phone earlier with a friend who 

356.97 358.84 B: um used to be a 

359.21 363.77 B: when she was a chi- when we were kids i knew her in childhood and she was a um 

365.95 374.22 B: [noise] semi pro i guess tennis player you know she was working her way up the ranks of professional tennis players in like elementary school 

373.96 375.78 A: mhm 

374.30 376.19 B: [noise] and we were talking about um 

376.90 388.39 B: you know why she gave it up and i guess it sort of relates to what we just said about the swimming like you know the the tenths of a second and how you have to have just that really super competitive drive that 

388.35 392.28 B: not only are you swimming to swim but you're swimming to beat the other people 

392.46 395.93 B: you know you really have to you have to want to 

396.76 407.16 B: to be the one who gets there two tenths of a second ahead and i mean it is about doing your best job but it's also about making sure that your best job is 

399.98 401.82 A: mhm 

407.47 417.57 B: better than anyone else's if you can [mn] and she i guess she kind of [cough] excuse me she didn't have that as a tennis player she just didn't have that killer spirit 

417.58 422.29 B: so she ended up not keeping at it professionally because she just didn't have that 

422.68 426.28 B: that hyper competitive edge you know 

426.46 433.54 A: well so many of those athletes i mean they almost leave home to train at such an early age it makes you wonder 

430.13 431.96 B: (( [lipsmack] [noise] mhm )) 

432.00 433.17 B: mhm 

433.80 436.41 A: if the price of it is worth it 

435.49 439.91 B: right well uh that's another thing that she said actually [noise] 'cause she thought that um 

440.55 447.54 B: [lipsmack] she had gotten to the point where she would have had to give up a lot to keep devoting herself to tennis and she kind of wasn't willing 

447.79 457.89 B: so yeah but it's [noise] it's amazing when when they actually get there and they just you know perform their hearts out [mn] what was the name of the girl who won the ice skating 

458.05 459.23 B: do you remember 

459.30 464.13 A: um it's an unusual name sarah no it's not sarah hughes 

463.05 468.59 B: [noise] yeah yeah yeah yeah that's right that's right and she was did you see her final 

464.18 465.46 A: yeah that's not 

468.78 472.87 B: skate you know the one that pretty much won her the gold oh 

471.12 475.52 A: [noise] yes 'cause i was really rooting for the um [lipsmack] 

476.63 478.63 A: oh man my mind is blank 

477.67 480.78 B: [noise] michelle kwan i wanted her too 

478.89 480.12 A: michelle kwan 

480.35 488.34 A: i really did 'cause she just spent so many years and worked so hard and had so much personality going into it 

481.08 482.38 B: yeah me too 

485.04 486.12 B: yeah 

486.15 495.59 B: i know and grace and beauty and i kind of felt like she got robbed the time before by that little carol lepinski girl who i never liked [cough] 

493.60 495.25 A: yeah 

496.13 499.80 B: so yeah i kind of wanted her too but then sarah hughes just 

500.22 505.81 B: you couldn't not like her you know she was she was beautiful and she was actually a really likeable figure 

505.39 507.18 A: yeah 

506.62 508.51 B: (( [lipsmack] so yeah but [noise] [mn] )) 

507.41 511.84 A: and she's turned out to be a you know very talented 'cause she's kept on 

511.32 515.14 B: uh-huh yeah she didn't retire [noise] which a lot of the 

516.03 525.95 B: gold medal people i think do 'cause they figure okay i've done that now i can i i can't really better that so i might as well just go ahead and be professional and make some money 

526.61 530.37 B: [noise] but i think she's she'll be at the next olympics i wonder [lipsmack] 

530.61 531.46 B: huh 

531.88 536.48 B: i wonder if that's tough you know to go into it knowing that she has all that to live up to 

536.62 537.92 A: it's got to be 

537.71 539.24 B: (( [noise] [lipsmack] i suppose [noise] )) 

538.98 544.79 A: i mean if you're the defending champion you've got that much more pressure on you to 

545.06 546.96 A: do it again i would think 

545.68 549.12 B: [noise] yeah yeah yeah that must be what she's 

548.54 550.22 A: uh do you play any sports 

550.41 563.64 B: it must be rough i'm just thinking oh well i used to do gymnastics in high school uh but a long time ago when i think back on like what i used to be able to do i sure as hell can't do it anymore [mn] um 

563.66 566.21 B: [lipsmack] [noise] so i did that um 

567.49 574.96 B: i hit a tennis ball occasionally but you can't really call it a game i just sort of hit a ball around um 

575.52 585.25 B: [noise] and you know i get to the gym but i don't really do anything competitively or and i don't really jog or anything like that [lipsmack] which i probably should do more often 

585.50 587.49 B: so you don't play soccer anymore [cough] 

587.09 588.38 A: mhm 

588.67 589.80 B: do you run mhm 

589.49 595.90 A: i did i i got into cycling it's a lot easier on your knees so i do a lot of bicycling 

593.35 594.47 B: sure 

595.19 596.57 B: oh that's good 

596.87 598.02 B: (( that's nice [noise] )) 

598.15 599.89 B: yeah it it seems like
