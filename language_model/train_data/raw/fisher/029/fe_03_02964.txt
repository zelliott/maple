62.81 64.56 B: i don't think i ever saw it 

62.83 64.40 A: [laughter] so 

64.46 65.43 A: (( hmm ))

67.72 73.17 A: yeah it's very few it's maybe you'll catch it like a couple of times a year 

73.23 77.05 A: and that's it other than that um i might watch football 

78.92 83.24 A: but i don't spend that many hours watching football it might be just like um 

84.34 86.34 A: it depends on um 

86.77 90.33 A: what team they're playing really that's how i watch it [laughter] [sigh] 

90.17 100.93 B: well i pr- i don't i don't have much interested in uh professional sports i um i may catch it on the news to see what's going on what the news reports say about uh 

94.77 95.44 A: (( mm )) 

101.26 104.63 B: like the if it's the end of the basketball season or 

104.70 109.62 B: the baseball what the how ba- the mariners are doing the mariners are like one of the favorite teams here 

109.56 110.36 A: (( mm )) 

110.43 113.87 B: um or the you know like the sonics 

113.99 118.68 B: um but i don't really understand basketball or football at all 

118.76 123.73 B: um baseball i do i used to go to the philadelphia phillies' games when i was younger 

124.19 128.08 B: but i um don't have as much interest in it now 

128.22 139.43 B: i think i feel like professional sports is too much about money making money and people aren't loyal to the teams like they used to be like when i was a kid my brother and i used to collect actually collect baseball cards and we had 

139.47 147.32 B: thousands of them they'll probably be worth a lot of money now but back then we didn't i don't know what we did with them all but we had you know some of the best 

139.59 140.51 A: right 

147.38 149.73 B: cards and things but um 

150.06 153.26 A: yeah see we had baseball cards too um 

153.68 156.13 A: was me and my sisters into collecting 

155.72 156.82 B: (( mhm oh )) 

156.22 161.27 A: but um nobody told us that to hold on to 'em and they will be worth money one day [laughter] 

160.00 163.75 B: i know 'cause i probably you know had some good ones but 

164.02 172.80 B: um they said i think because it's so much involved with making money and not really loyal to the teams right just feel like it's not 

171.14 172.29 A: mhm 

173.44 181.41 B: something that i find very good i think maybe it's college football is more they're really in it for the game 

181.46 183.16 A: mhm 

181.69 182.74 B: um 

183.90 188.96 B: [lipsmack] but uh i just think they get paid too much money and they have attitudes a lot of them 

188.81 201.27 A: [laughter] you're right about the attitude thing i think um uh a lot of the um athletes are really about money most of them come from like poor backgrounds or you know 

190.80 191.82 B: (( [laughter] )) 

197.39 198.35 B: (( mhm )) 

201.40 210.87 A: low poverty whatever and then they get this money and then they act crazy they get arrested or they just expect people and they feel that was okay 

206.70 207.73 B: mm 

210.73 212.03 B: mhm 

211.28 212.41 A: um 

212.67 213.94 A: but if 

213.99 217.08 A: um the problem i have with um 

217.60 223.49 A: the football team is you're right there is no loyalty because you have like every year you got a whole new team 

223.54 226.36 A: you know most of the people are traded or whatever 

223.55 224.55 B: (( i know )) 

225.99 236.24 B: even here they the uh coaches um they you know [mn] they stay and uh they go to other teams and that sort of thing are really just uh 

226.45 227.44 A: even if 

230.79 231.85 A: right 

235.23 238.42 A: 'cause i was watching basketball the other day and 

238.49 244.15 A: i known that on the six fifteen this guy tyrone who uh was traded like a couple of years ago 

243.85 244.67 B: mm 

244.63 247.68 A: and he's back i'm like when did he come back 

247.10 248.15 B: mm 

248.04 261.35 A: [laughter] so my nephew said oh yeah they made this trade and i'm like they keep up on it the the young guys like to keep up on it they don't care if it's if it's basketball season they're in basketball season with football season they're in football season 

255.43 256.44 B: (( mhm )) 

259.12 260.28 B: yeah 

261.30 265.74 A: i think the only thing that they don't watch so much of is um 

266.15 272.91 A: baseball even though sometimes they like to know who's doing what but they don't spend a whole lot of time watching baseball 

272.97 283.01 A: but they but they whatever season it is and then they they'll watch all the teams play especially during the playoff games time which is like [lipsmack] during this uh 

277.97 279.45 B: mhm 

283.71 287.69 A: next couple of weeks they'll watch maybe basketball maybe 

288.06 290.72 A: like three games a night [laughter] 

290.95 301.71 B: yeah i kind of tally of the uh when it gets towards the end of the season basketball season or football season or baseball season i kind of keep an eye on what's going on but the rest of the year i don't pay much attention to it 

302.06 304.83 B: and um i think women you know 

305.28 310.21 B: [mn] i'm older and we didn't have so much emphasis on sports but um 

309.07 310.65 A: mhm how old are you 

311.05 313.23 B: i'll be f- fifty two on saturday 

313.15 314.79 A: oh god bless 

313.46 315.22 B: but um 

315.80 328.59 B: [lipsmack] i mean i know that women now um it's good if they're involved in sports it helps them with their confidence and self esteem and i you know look up to women that you know are involved in sports and trying to 

323.92 325.35 A: (( you mhm )) 

328.66 332.62 B: compete with the men and that sort of thing and we let them play golf now and 

332.09 335.28 A: oh yeah i was really amazed about that 

332.83 333.95 B: yeah 

334.88 335.86 B: mhm 

336.06 345.19 B: so in it they need more women to be in sports i think the one woman that's involved in golf she's competing against a man somebody who's really good not tiger woods but somebody else 

344.78 345.85 A: mhm 

345.78 347.21 B: but um 

347.46 355.51 B: they seem only be interested in is racing car racing i don't know if they consider that a sport i guess it kind of is but but i i like racing car racing 

351.88 354.02 A: (( yeah that is a sport mhm )) 

355.28 363.47 A: i think it's so dangerous just to watch them go at such fast speeds and i used to watch it every now and then if i could catch it 

362.87 363.87 B: mhm 

363.57 369.93 A: um but it was just like so scary 'specially when they came around the curves and looked like the cars was crashing i 

370.11 375.68 A: i didn't want to scream so i stopped [laughter] 'cause it i think i was more excited than they were 

371.63 374.25 B: mhm mhm 

376.29 379.84 B: so do you jog or anything 'cause you're [mn] you say you haven't had just 

378.76 382.30 A: i work out at the gym almost every day but um 

381.42 382.37 B: (( mhm )) 

383.85 386.78 A: it's more sort of to tone the fat 'cause i'm forty one 

386.63 388.74 B: oh okay you sound younger 

387.47 390.18 A: [laughter] and and uh i do 

390.33 393.19 B: yeah i work out too at a women's health club but 

393.07 393.85 A: mhm 

393.36 396.54 B: it's it's nowhere like you know playing sports 

396.60 405.71 A: no no well it's a lot of athletic people that come in here they [mn] they all look like they're in shape sometime i feel like i'm the only the flabbiest one in here 

402.38 403.30 B: mm 

406.00 407.91 B: well they they raided seattle 

406.02 416.26 A: [laughter] but it's a new gym and there's only w- and there's and there's like the guys were saying you know one of the trainers told me he says well you know the all these guys come here to watch you sweat 

416.09 417.16 B: (( mm )) 

416.58 429.07 A: [laughter] because there's like very few women that go and usually if the weather's bad nobody goes but i'll go but then i know i can do whatever i want and i don't have to worry about m- waiting for somebody to get on something so 

423.08 424.02 B: (( mhm )) 

428.39 431.12 B: mhm mm how long have you been working out 

431.20 434.36 A: (( it's been this has been this is going on my third year )) 

434.38 435.84 B: (( have you seen a difference )) 

435.98 437.85 A: oh yeah i used to be um 

438.24 447.45 A: a size eighteen two hundred and five pounds i'm down to a size eight i now weigh like one i weigh one fifty 

441.61 442.47 B: mhm 

443.92 445.11 B: well that's cool 

447.27 449.03 B: that's cool yeah 

448.37 449.45 A: mhm 

449.88 453.74 A: i'm happy 'cause i started working out 'cause i was real stressful 

454.02 455.22 A: situation 

454.18 460.15 B: yeah i do a lot of walking too 'cause it takes me to seattle i don't have a car you don't have to have one here and 

460.08 460.88 A: mm 

460.25 467.14 B: i live in the downtown area so it's really a lot better to get around without a car and it's hard to find parking here you have to pay uh quite a bit of money to 

467.23 468.95 B: have your car parked 

467.44 469.38 A: oh yeah 'cause you're downtown 

468.97 479.14 B: mhm i did have a car for a while but i even when i did have one i didn't use because for maybe if i was going out for the weekend or at night or shopping but i 

470.12 470.93 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

479.17 482.60 B: i really do like having to walk and 

482.11 487.39 A: mhm i would love to move downtown it'll be great 'cause i like to walk anyway and it [mn] 

482.62 483.37 B: (( so )) 

484.82 488.52 B: mhm i love walking helps relieve stress like you said 

488.28 491.13 A: yeah and the bus fares so high so 

492.27 498.01 B: yeah right here in building apartment the bill is seventy a month to park and that's low considered to some places so 

498.44 500.07 B: um and then you're uh 

499.27 501.01 A: how much is it you said again 

500.77 503.58 B: seventy dollars a month to park your car 

502.44 504.07 A: oh whoo 

504.31 505.65 B: yeah so 

504.72 513.69 A: i think a lot of people that work downtown pay a lot of money but that the bad thing is like when you had those sporting events or whatever they come to town 

512.07 513.18 B: (( mhm )) 

513.32 514.42 B: mhm 

513.82 517.66 A: then they're in trouble 'cause people park all over the place 

517.24 524.23 B: oh yeah that's how it is here 'cause the safeco field and the sea uh hawks stadium which is both fairly new 

524.23 534.01 B: are downtown in area and god you should see what they charge at at f- i can't believe that sometimes they'll charge forty dollars for them to park the car they take advantage of people 

532.35 533.31 A: (( mm )) 

534.55 536.61 B: (( but people pay it you know it's )) 

535.98 539.17 A: mhm well they tow a lot of cars around here 

536.78 538.38 B: (( i don't know how it's going to be now )) 

539.27 540.70 B: they do yeah 

539.42 548.34 A: they do a lot of towing and it's ridiculous because they've got to the point that people from new jersey didn't want to come and work in philly because of the high rates of parking 

540.89 541.84 B: (( mhm mm )) 

548.02 553.56 B: yeah i that's why i used to when i worked in i lived in and i used to commute to philadelphia to work 

553.43 554.32 A: (( [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

554.33 558.14 B: yeah but we had parking still for e._p._s. for a while and we had parking 

559.08 560.21 B: (( but um )) 

561.89 567.38 B: other than that i don't know it's different f- for you know for a lot of women's uh sports i think they have a a 

567.62 568.77 A: mhm 

567.74 569.77 B: different outlook but um 

570.15 572.89 B: tennis i guess more tennis and 

573.89 576.03 B: [lipsmack] some golf and um 

576.35 578.05 B: well they have softball teams 

578.14 579.13 A: yeah 

578.87 582.73 B: but we're not into football yet i think they did try to start a women's football 

583.14 587.82 B: retire post team or something like that but i think football's really dangerous 'cause 

585.30 586.52 A: (( mhm )) 

588.02 588.98 A: (( oh my )) 

588.38 591.78 B: you'd get a lot of injuries from being trampled on 

591.14 595.34 A: but it seems like the guys enjoy being smashed into each other 'cause [laughter] 

594.69 596.02 B: mhm 

597.08 599.89 B: they're rough and tumble in anyway i guess when i was a kid
