82.84 89.04 B: that are you know fun fun people to watch characters and personalities and so i'll 

88.88 99.32 B: i'll i'll do that uh a little and that was actually one of the reasons we we got uh we got cable t._v. last year was to look at watch the mariners' games occasionally 

99.37 102.38 B: but uh it's it's it's a pretty 

102.60 105.66 B: uh pretty small obsession for [laughter] for us 

105.70 107.35 B: uh so 

107.77 111.13 A: [sigh] mhm well it is for uh for here too uh 

108.32 109.34 B: yeah i don't 

111.19 119.91 A: once in a blue moon i might watch tennis not very often more than anything i'd watch figure skating or the olympics when they're around 

115.50 116.17 B: (( [cough] [mn] )) 

119.58 126.55 B: now you're getting now there's a there's a there's something they olympics are fun to watch even if it's like like sports i'm not terribly into 

126.50 137.25 B: you know there's the to see the people from all of the different countries and and they're they're they're so good and the sk- the skaters skating can be so pretty and 

126.51 128.31 A: right 

136.36 138.01 A: beautiful 

138.04 138.79 B: (( mm )) 

138.10 144.63 A: even the gymnastics i don't know how y- how well built you are but i'm a short little chubby lady 

144.41 145.47 B: (( uh-huh [cough] )) 

144.65 155.44 A: and i can just see me doing all those somersaults and uh uh the the the the moves that those ath- that those athletes makes just absolutely astounding 

155.67 157.72 A: uh now um 

158.30 172.38 A: i've got a sister that's thirteen years old she's very slender built she can do any of it but you know i'm just a little chubby girl and and i can't i c- i couldn't even begin to do a triple somersault or whatever they call it 

172.61 173.66 A: um 

173.72 179.19 A: [lipsmack] anyway um i'd say other than football there's just not a whole lot now the wrestling 

179.42 181.14 B: do do you watch the wrestling 

180.52 181.93 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

181.54 195.51 B: okay now that's a i uh i you i did when i was a kid and i just haven't seen it on too much re- recently i think that that uh it falls in the category from what i understand of uh 

195.52 200.78 B: of entertainment or theatre as much as as sport so 

200.95 201.77 B: (( in )) 

201.00 212.94 A: yeah exactly that's the reason why why i kind of follow along 'cause you got hulk hogan and uh the rock and you know there's just so many of them that's went into big movies 

201.82 202.79 B: (( in a )) 

203.26 203.82 B: (( [cough] )) 

212.67 214.11 B: (( mhm )) 

213.42 217.08 A: and you know it's just kind of fun to say well which one's going in this time 

217.31 218.24 B: right 

217.38 223.60 A: you know i say now that there's a lot of hype on on the wrestling thing i mean i don't think any of it's real anymore 

223.63 226.74 A: horribly sometimes it is but very rarely 

226.89 227.83 A: so 

227.17 229.76 B: i guess there i used to watch uh 

230.00 234.49 B: (( roller derby kind of like that too and i don't know how many groups are there )) 

232.53 237.07 A: no i've watched yeah i've watched roller derbies like that too a few times 

237.12 237.96 B: but 

237.22 239.56 A: (( they don't even know it down here i think )) 

239.57 245.51 B: yeah i've i don't even i haven't done it in in a while i was actually on a vacation one time 

245.38 258.06 B: and they the the roller derby happened to be on the uh on the the channel when we we were just in the hotel and and i had it was like uh [mn] something i hadn't seen in twenty years probably so 

258.19 261.41 B: so it was kind of fun to to um 

261.52 264.07 B: uh to watch but um 

263.97 271.21 B: i don't i'm not a big television watcher in general uh so that probably uh 

271.06 280.06 B: probably have something to do with it i don't even keep track i i would watch the mariners more often but i i don't even really keep track of uh when things are on so 

280.03 291.10 B: [laughter] it's kind of uh kind of hard to spend more of my time in front of a screen um doing stuff on the internet these days with the computer 

291.18 292.20 B: so 

292.85 294.55 B: just uh different uh 

294.87 295.70 B: diff- 

295.78 298.52 B: different uh priorities i guess 

298.34 309.63 A: yeah well th- [mn] i've got um my thirteen year old sister's in uh uh softball and quite frankly when it's softball season that's where i'm at anyway 

309.81 316.65 A: either practising two days a week and and two games a week or three games a week and practising two day two days a week 

316.57 331.50 B: [cough] oh that's great you're actually you actually get out and do that i would dearly love to play some play some softball or uh baseball but i've never i've never done the things to hook up with the uh [cough] you know with the leagues or whatever i wish there were some 

317.00 317.75 A: (( so )) 

331.35 338.79 B: i wish there were some ways where people who were just into it casually could you know could go go and play 

338.83 340.19 B: play some 

340.38 344.98 B: like famlot games or work up or something like we did when we were kids 

344.11 346.11 A: (( [noise] [cough] mhm )) 

345.51 349.12 B: um 'cause it's it's such a lot of fun i enjoy 

349.40 350.53 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

349.40 360.78 B: i enjoy hitting a ball around and and uh however my luck's if i started again i'm in i'm in my forties i probably sprain an ankle or or something like that but [cough] 

359.16 360.43 A: [laughter] 

360.80 370.68 A: once you get in your forties uh n- nothing personal but it seems like it's pretty close to time to worry about being a spectator and not a not a participant 

362.66 363.25 B: (( mm )) 

370.18 380.15 B: nah yeah i know what you're saying but i don't a- i i w- i keep doing you know i w- i w- i still walk and swim and you know try 

371.25 372.71 A: (( uh )) 

379.39 383.71 A: oh i still walk and swim there's no question we just got back from the lake yesterday 

383.70 385.07 B: mhm 

384.14 387.94 A: uh we went down there for the first time this year and it's still kind of nippy 

388.03 394.41 A: but as far well just like uh where i used to be on a league bowling league there 

388.20 389.34 B: yeah 

394.29 395.31 B: mhm 

394.45 397.37 A: ain't no way we tried to go uh bowling 

397.38 400.32 A: uh back uh back in the winter 

400.38 404.29 A: i could not raise the ball high enough 

404.53 413.45 A: on the heavy balls that were had the holes big enough for my fingers and the lighter balls [mn] i couldn't get my fingers in so i was having to do it like 

404.59 405.37 B: (( mhm )) 

413.40 423.02 A: a little bitty kid you know getting up there to the very line and just rolling it a little bit i did better than than uh my my uh thirteen uh ten year old cousin though 

423.18 424.24 B: uh-huh 

423.81 429.20 A: she had ninety nine percent gutter balls at least i didn't have uh seventy five percent gutter balls [laughter] 

428.27 432.31 B: (( [laughter] the yeah bowling bow- )) 

431.15 432.14 A: now i w- 

432.74 441.06 A: uh yeah i- it's it's a lot of fun but at the same time if you if you got a back that's got any problems at all it's going to show up with bowling 

441.20 442.09 B: yeah 

441.89 456.26 A: so you know nah well anyway uh i'm a big fan of uh parent child just like uh two or three times that we've had um [lipsmack] andrea has been in uh softball we've had a parent's game 

455.98 457.24 B: i uh-huh 

456.92 462.49 A: and uh where the parents were against the kids and it was hilarious 

461.84 464.88 B: i bet that would that would be a blast 

464.22 472.62 A: yeah the and and to see these older people getting up there women you know full grown women that's got to have going to have a problem running 

472.49 473.63 B: (( [laughter] )) 

472.81 479.70 A: uh i mean if you can hardly see a women holding herself up and running it looks hilarious 

479.80 485.70 A: but at least they got the guts to get out there i'm not trying to be vulgar but [laughter] it was so funny 

486.03 487.08 B: that's uh 

487.11 488.27 B: that's 

488.63 493.35 B: i like i like that kind of stuff i i s- i i'd like i think that's part of 

493.37 504.85 B: the thing uh i don't watch more sports on t._v. is i think in general it's be better for par- people for participative stuff more even if they aren't really good if you know 

504.32 514.84 A: [sigh] yeah or else is it now i- in their case the kids changed up the the rules a little bit uh where you know the kids kind of had an edge [noise] 

510.54 511.53 B: [laughter] 

515.19 516.66 A: [laughter] 

515.77 519.92 B: gosh i i would think so yeah [laughter] i would think that that they'd be 

519.07 523.00 A: hey they were practising all the time us parents didn't 

523.14 532.16 B: i bet they i b- i i i bet they uh they really enjoyed b- uh i i i assume they probably beat the parents and uh really enjoyed it 

529.48 531.23 A: [noise] yes becau- 

532.07 536.72 A: because the if if the uh daddies hit the ball over the fence 

537.11 538.99 A: they were automatically out 

539.15 545.91 B: oh okay so that was like a like a uh a an equalizer thing so 

545.14 555.18 A: all right because the menfolk could hit it over the uh fence because uh the you know field was uh meant for uh adolescents not adults 

555.20 556.24 B: (( mhm mm )) 

555.47 556.71 A: um 

557.10 561.70 A: [lipsmack] let's see what was another g- oh and i escaped because i was in charge of the cookout 

562.20 564.05 A: so i didn't have to get out there 

564.74 571.28 A: [laughter] but um my sister'd got my dad out on a pop fly she was playing in uh uh hind catcher 

571.77 573.82 A: that was hilarious 

574.09 575.00 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

574.70 583.93 A: and i got my dad out on uh [cough] a pop fly that nearly went over the fence but i caught using his glove 

585.09 589.96 A: so yeah i enjoy participating as long as it's not one of those things where you're 

590.03 593.18 A: um criticized you know 

593.32 595.16 A: a- as long as it's in fun 

594.87 598.91 B: right you know that's that's the point i think the i think 

599.23 599.89 B: for me any-
