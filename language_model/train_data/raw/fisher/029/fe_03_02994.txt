421.70 426.01 A: but actually the vet helped us out 'cause it was almost a thousand dollars 

426.13 427.69 B: (( yikes )) 

426.19 434.12 A: but he was he was young so that it grew back without having to have it um a metal plate or anything on 

434.09 435.42 B: yeah

437.10 438.58 B: well now they have

450.66 460.65 A: and pull on him like that we took him to one vet and they said oh all we have to do is drain it let's just keep it in a week we kept in a week and a half and then went back and they said oh 

452.08 453.52 B: poor animal 

461.96 476.11 A: oh if if we take it out now it's gonna drain back out let's leave it in in a little bit longer it's like no he's walking around with his cone on his head he's knocking everybody over you know he's having a hard time getting around let's just take it out 

476.20 482.76 A: we took it out within two days it it blew back up so we took him to another vet that cost us a hundred and fifty 

482.77 483.92 B: and then what ha- 

482.97 486.64 A: for that so we took him to two other vets got um 

487.77 494.96 A: what do you want to say to recheck him and revaluate it and they said he needed an operation which is called quilting 

495.12 504.81 A: where they stitch his ear up [laughter] it looks like a quilt afterwards it's not the same but 'til we got done and all through it was eight hundred dollars

545.88 552.50 A: i've i've never checked into it but i guess it's supposed to be okay when they're young it's when they're older
