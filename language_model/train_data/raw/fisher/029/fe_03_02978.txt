130.49 137.01 A: and he she stays up under your feet and i really didn't want my daddy to have her because i was scared that he would fall over her 

136.28 137.85 B: mhm

165.49 169.02 A: and she doesn't really like men that much either [noise] 

170.50 174.10 A: she doesn't like men at all [noise] 'cause she barks 

172.27 173.54 B: mine it was 

173.98 178.48 B: mine used to crawl in between the me and my boyfriend when we were laying down on the bed 

178.72 180.97 B: and like try and push me away from him 

180.49 190.07 A: [noise] [noise] [laughter] gosh mm we've had to buy this one one of those bark control collars because she barks about everything but my husband works um 

190.35 198.95 A: him and his father own this business that's um l. j. n. communications where they work on police radios and towers and all that kind of stuff like that 

198.37 200.17 B: mhm 

199.21 203.33 A: and we had the sheriff of our town [noise] come over one day and she bit him 

203.50 204.49 B: (( ooh )) 

204.08 207.07 A: she's very high strung [laughter] 

207.67 213.41 A: she's not not a dog i'd wanna get again but [noise] now like i said now that i have her i wouldn't get rid of her 

213.10 214.81 B: yeah you're too attached 

214.19 215.78 A: right right 

216.27 217.98 A: would not get rid of her 

218.80 221.47 A: but now like our outside dogs they're 

222.52 225.46 A: [sigh] we had a rottweiler and he died 

225.90 231.32 A: like right after we had our son so we decided not to get another one 'cause we had had him like seven or eight years 

231.55 232.72 A: and um 

232.85 237.16 A: it wasn't too far after that dog died we had a dog wander up at the house 

237.65 247.52 A: and it was some- you know how people would ride around and throw a dog out [noise] and we felt sorry for her so we put her in a pen and a couple of months later i think she had nine puppies 

241.08 242.03 B: yes 

247.32 248.79 B: oh my [laughter] 

248.02 258.05 A: [laughter] yeah and so we gave a few of them away and ended up keeping some of them and we had her fixed so she couldn't have any more puppies and she ended up getting bit by a rattlesnake 

257.85 259.01 B: (( oh )) 

258.57 269.76 A: [noise] and then her puppies have went on to give us other puppies [laughter] so but we just let them ramble because we live in the middle of a pine tree [noise] field so they have plenty of room to run around 

270.05 271.68 A: so we just let 'em ramble 

272.55 280.91 A: and what comes home comes home sometimes they'll be gone a week at a time and we figure they got somebody else's house they go stay at [noise] and eat for a little while and then come home 

284.10 285.19 A: (( [noise] what is that )) 

284.23 287.44 B: so did your dog pass away from the rattlesnake bite or 

287.16 295.70 A: [mn] the one that we had fixed now she did she um when she came up her head was like swollen at three times the size it should have been 

295.31 296.27 B: uh-huh 

295.74 300.66 A: and we took him the vet took her to the vet and they said that she was too far gone 

300.44 301.75 B: yeah the venom 

301.84 307.52 A: yeah yeah because of where he had hit her too that it had closed her airway 

307.26 308.56 B: mhm 

307.99 316.91 A: but now the other dog that i had the one that i had for so long now he was just oh he had started getting seizures and everything else 

317.02 318.80 B: (( a lot of health problems )) 

317.27 319.13 A: (( [cough] right )) 

319.67 333.58 A: he could be walking around and he'd pee pee on hisself and didn't even know he was doing it and he'd wake up in the middle of the night having those seizures and stuff like they wanted us to put him to sleep but there was no way i could i had had him since i was like in eighth grade 

333.57 335.15 B: (( yeah that's a long time )) 

333.73 335.34 A: i just couldn't imagine 

335.69 342.78 A: putting him to sleep i said that'd be like putting your grandma or grandpa in the nursing home and they'd say well we don't think we can do anything for him no more let's just put him to sleep 

342.46 343.46 B: uh-huh 

343.01 347.75 A: i just couldn't be doing that it would have broke my heart 

349.06 349.72 A: (( [noise] )) 

349.87 351.69 B: i miss having my dog [mn] 

351.42 353.89 A: it's it's a lot of companionship i just 

353.22 354.35 B: yes 

354.12 358.57 A: couldn't imagine it either like i said when spike died and my when i had to learn 

358.86 369.71 A: [cough] that outside dog that had just wandered up i got where i would bring her in the house and give her a bath and make her stay in here and i mean she was a bigger dog it wasn't like she was a little peekapoo like he was 

369.80 377.60 A: and she'd be like oh my god why are you bringing me in here like this she'd sit by the door wanting to go back outside but i just had to have somebody in here with me 

372.42 373.55 B: [laughter] 

377.75 381.00 A: but now if i wouldn't have gotten ceecee 

381.23 386.09 A: the dog we have now before my son was born [noise] you know 

386.14 392.07 A: i really don't think i'd have one because i was kinda scared of how it was gonna be inside with them 

392.58 398.19 A: [noise] like with her pad back there and i could imagine him going back there and getting on that and all that stuff like that 

392.82 393.62 B: (( yeah )) 

398.50 401.72 A: but i mean he seems like he really enjoys [noise] her 

402.78 403.84 A: [laughter] 

403.96 413.08 A: he chases her around the house everywhere [laughter] and she i mean he can stick his hand all in her mouth and pull her by the tail and all that and she acts like she doesn't care 

412.68 414.81 B: yeah that's the way some dogs are 

414.02 421.29 A: [mn] yeah for her to be attached to him as she is i really scared that we were gonna have bad problems with her 

421.62 425.31 A: trying to bite him but she doesn't care at all 

425.50 428.37 A: she follows him around like he's gonna drop food all the time 

428.80 433.05 A: like we don't ever feed her [laughter] she's just a big butter ball 

428.81 431.43 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

434.87 440.34 A: [mn] but then again we worried about the fur being everywhere and all that stuff and it hasn't been that bad either 

440.72 446.88 A: so 'cause my other dog was black i guess we didn't see the fur as much as we do with her because she's white and you see the fur 

446.51 448.61 B: yeah and it goes on everything 

446.97 448.94 A: and no matter how much you vacuum 

449.04 450.78 A: they still lie around [laughter] 

450.97 454.11 B: and they're not really short haired animals either 

453.71 462.69 A: no we just had her shaved and when we took her to get her shaved i said i want her to look like one of those japanese hairless dogs [laughter] i don't care if she doesn't have a bit of hair on her head 

459.77 461.54 B: [laughter] 

462.28 463.98 B: (( like a sharpie [laughter] )) 

463.28 467.80 A: yeah [laughter] i said she can look like a rat i don't care 

468.60 476.74 A: [cough] because her hair grows so fast too which is [noise] ugh it's awful we have to get her cut at least twice a month 

477.79 485.77 A: i'm sitting here just talking [laughter] you can go ahead [laughter] you can tell i stay at home all day with a baby [laughter] never having anybody to talk to 

486.84 489.96 A: 'til my husband comes home and then i bother him and 

491.84 493.60 A: any other pets [noise] 

493.99 499.95 B: uh at this moment no we have about i'd say a good month ago we had to get rid of her 

501.03 504.37 A: oh that's not much how long did you have her before you had to get rid of her 

503.85 504.91 B: a year 

504.60 505.95 A: oh goodness 

506.52 508.62 B: my daughter was attached to her 

508.57 509.39 A: mm 

509.87 513.02 A: [noise] did you give her away to somebody that you knew or 

511.63 514.95 B: yes it was it was one of our friends that had taken her 

514.54 516.60 A: (( [noise] well at least you can still her then )) 

516.54 517.74 B: yeah she's

521.02 521.92 A: [laughter] 

523.04 526.50 A: and you it is a bigger dog so she really needed somewhere to run 

526.25 527.28 B: mhm 

527.57 529.66 A: [noise] do you live in a big city then 

527.73 528.47 B: i 

529.72 532.75 B: no i live in a small town and i live in an apartment so 

531.04 531.93 A: oh 

532.25 533.13 A: oh 

533.76 534.49 A: mm 

534.84 536.42 A: i couldn't imagine when we 

536.54 549.75 A: [mn] before we moved to where we were we are now we had that rottweiler and we had to get him treated for heartworms and we had to keep him inside and i know that was awful it was like every time he turned around he knocked something over he didn't mean to but 

548.94 554.20 B: mhm well the people who have taken my dog they have two rotties

559.42 560.30 A: but 

560.52 571.92 A: we thought you know how people say they're so bad with kids and all that that we'd just wait 'til our little boy was a little bit older before we got another one because we really did like him a lot he was a good dog [noise] 

565.49 566.49 B: no 

571.99 576.09 B: yeah rotties are just how they're brought up is how is how they're gonna be 

575.11 576.80 A: (( right right [noise] [noise] )) 

576.53 580.10 B: just like a german shepherd they say german shepherds are really bad too 

582.07 583.76 B: just how you treat 'em 

583.45 584.87 A: that's very true 

585.00 587.69 A: [noise] it di- it's like 

588.32 593.76 A: [noise] any dog would bite you just never know 'cause we have those outside dogs now like i said when
