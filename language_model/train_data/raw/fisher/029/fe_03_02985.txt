152.89 153.83 B: and then how 

154.71 156.32 B: oh my word [laughter] [noise] [noise] 

156.36 159.42 A: it was so cute 'cause he got to the airport 

159.39 171.63 A: and uh the flight attendants and everything they were just you know they were like what's in here we don't see anything in here she had shredded up a bunch of newspaper and he was underneath the newspaper just shivering 

171.52 173.31 B: probably terrified 

171.74 176.83 A: and all we could see was the yeah all we could see was the newspaper [laughter] moving 

176.02 177.88 B: oh poor little thing 

177.50 179.70 A: he was so tiny [laughter] 

180.02 181.03 B: (( [noise] uh )) 

181.09 185.45 B: well our english setter um we got we got her from a breeder 

185.02 186.30 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

185.66 190.01 B: nearby and um we'd found them they were in the newspaper 

191.03 196.34 B: and we knew that we wanted an english setter because my husband wanted to try and hunt with her 

191.43 192.86 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

196.00 197.91 A: mhm 

196.84 200.55 B: well as it turns out she had the 

200.69 207.48 B: bluest blood you can possibly get for an english setter and all the the fancy pedigree but she's as dumb as a post 

207.17 208.98 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

208.79 216.01 B: there there is no way anybody would ever dare try to hunt with this dog because you take her out on the 

216.03 219.01 B: into the field and she'd go off 

218.81 219.97 A: [laughter] 

219.36 221.24 B: and you'd never know if she'd come back 

221.19 222.64 A: oh no [laughter] 

221.83 232.25 B: and he he had all these plans of training her he got the book he you know got the cap gun and shot it off next to her when she was eating and she just 

232.63 235.55 B: looked at him as if he was nuts and went back to eating 

235.30 236.53 A: [laughter] 

235.63 239.42 B: and it didn't faze her at all and he thought okay i'm all set 

239.59 240.85 B: until 

241.37 250.94 B: then we tried to you know we were tried to house break her and train her to sit and we did succeed in those things but it took an awful long time 

250.66 252.09 A: mhm 

250.99 255.22 B: um thankfully she was sweet and loving and gentle as can be 

256.13 259.07 B: which is why we why we kept her [laughter] 

258.64 260.04 A: yes 

259.39 266.03 B: basically if it weren't for her personality um i i think she would have been long gone [laughter] mm 

265.35 267.52 A: yeah [laughter] 

267.65 269.77 A: yeah you gotta have dog that's uh 

269.83 272.41 A: good has a good personality 

272.16 273.28 B: mhm 

272.84 281.22 A: i don't know how these people keep these dogs that are so mean like across the street we have a [noise] our neighbor his his dog is just absolutely 

281.49 294.02 A: vicious and he leaves them in the cag- in his fenced in little area cage like a it's a little tiny kennel he made for him he leaves him there all the time [noise] and it just i don't understand why he even has a dog 

282.74 283.65 B: (( ugh )) 

288.32 290.02 B: mhm yeah 

291.21 292.16 B: (( oh )) 

293.98 295.79 B: yeah that's cruel 

295.36 297.75 A: [noise] yeah he doesn't spend time with him 

298.51 299.40 B: mhm 

299.10 305.89 A: my dog is an indoor dog he even goes potty in the house on newspapers [laughter] and uh 

303.41 304.95 B: (( ah okay )) 

305.91 315.31 A: the reason i did that is because [noise] um it gets really cold here and uh i used to have a chihuahua a long time ago and he [noise] um collapsed outside in the cold one time 

309.61 310.38 B: (( mm )) 

315.18 316.36 B: (( oh my word )) 

315.77 318.75 A: so i swore if i ever got another one i would uh 

319.33 331.87 A: i would tra- train him for the newspapers and it's really nice 'cause it's really easy to clean up and you know it's way out of the way i don't have to worry about [noise] getting him out on time and he's he's really good about going there so 

329.22 330.21 B: mhm 

332.08 334.10 A: that helps [laughter] 

332.27 333.41 B: (( well good )) 

334.56 336.04 B: [mn] how do 

336.10 338.58 B: how do your dog and cat get along 

338.52 341.41 A: [noise] they absolutely adore each other 

341.38 350.13 A: i got the i got my cat first she i found her on the road um it was like the middle of night and i was going down a country road [noise] had my window down 

348.72 349.64 B: mhm 

350.11 361.07 A: and i hear this meowing when i come to a stop so i got out and i realized it was coming from under my car [noise] and there was a little tiny baby kitten there and [noise] she was very sickly 

358.97 360.03 B: aw 

361.12 363.76 A: and i thought she was gonna die so i brought her home and 

363.78 370.18 A: i told my husband you know you're gonna be mad me 'cause he doesn't like cats and [laughter] i said but i couldn't leave her there 

367.23 368.88 B: [laughter] 

370.15 381.76 A: so he he just he let me keep her and he thought for sure she was gonna die and i kept her alive [noise] she's deaf in one ear though but she's really really healthy now so 

370.48 371.28 B: right 

380.55 381.59 B: mhm 

381.75 389.21 A: that's how i got her and then a few months later i got drako and i think she thought she was drako's mother or something 

389.40 391.35 A: they can't live without each other 

392.06 392.79 B: ah 

392.09 395.15 A: i know if one passes away the other one's gonna be just 

395.49 397.37 A: distraught [laughter] it's just 

396.71 401.07 B: so you'll end up getting a second one we did that we had [noise] 

398.55 399.59 A: yeah 

401.23 415.02 B: we've always had two cats um we started a long time ago in law school where two different cats adopted us a year apart and they were totally inseparable well when the one died the other 

410.23 411.18 A: mhm 

415.01 419.20 B: just kept wandering a- around the house crying looking for 

419.52 420.65 B: her sister 

420.26 421.88 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

421.60 423.55 B: and we ended up 

423.85 428.38 B: going uh we have a um no kill animal shelter in the next town 

428.08 429.01 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

428.39 433.70 B: and it's neat because they have a cat room and they have a kitten room 

433.91 440.43 B: and the the adult cats are all in one room together and the kittens are all in the other room and you just go in the room with them 

440.45 443.80 B: and pet them and play with them and see what you think 

443.45 444.84 A: (( oh wow )) 

444.46 449.34 B: and rather than you know just being able to see them through the cages 

448.62 449.67 A: mhm 

449.58 453.59 B: and um so we end- you know so we got 

454.66 455.60 B: (( purse )) 

455.71 457.08 B: a new sibling 

457.18 464.15 B: and then when she died of course our cat the new cat was used to a buddy 

463.84 465.06 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

464.42 467.57 B: and i mean they adore shannon shannon's our dog 

467.31 468.51 A: yeah 

467.89 476.97 B: and um they they play and they get along great but shannon's older she's twelve years ol- she's well let see she's now thirteen 

476.99 479.56 B: which is really old for an english setter 

479.21 480.34 A: mhm 

480.43 483.46 B: 'cause their average life expectancy is twelve 

483.17 484.28 A: wow 

483.61 486.09 B: and so she doesn't wanna play a whole lot [laughter] 

485.31 486.87 A: yeah [laughter] 

486.62 494.58 B: and uh she still thinks she's a puppy in a lot of ways but she's not as playful with them as she used to be 

494.64 497.94 B: and uh so we got another one and uh 

498.14 501.11 B: max is he's a grey tabby 

501.21 502.24 A: (( aw )) 

501.46 503.01 B: and is the 

503.14 507.21 B: he i swear he thinks he's a dog 'cause he plays fetch 

505.45 507.27 A: [laughter] 

507.46 509.83 B: you get those little crinkle balls 

509.16 510.63 A: (( yeah )) 

510.13 515.53 B: that they have they're made of yarn but they may have some crinkly paper in them as well 

515.49 526.75 B: and he'll walk around the house cry- with this horrible cry that sounds like he's in great pain and what it is is he's meowing with this ball in his mouth 

525.33 527.93 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

526.91 528.01 B: and [laughter] 

528.29 531.64 B: and he'll drop it at your feet you throw it he fetches it 

528.75 529.38 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

531.24 532.73 A: oh my gosh [noise]

539.64 540.69 B: (( and uh )) 

541.36 551.27 B: yeah well he first sa- he's the second cat of ours that has done that and we didn't train them to do it they they just had a ball and we threw it for 'em and they decided to return it 

545.10 545.94 A: oh 

550.97 553.28 A: [laughter] so you could do it again 

552.06 552.83 B: uh 

553.31 555.00 A: that is just so neat 

554.18 556.23 B: yeah and with our other cat 

556.27 562.16 B: um she has no interest in playing fetch whatsoever she'll chase the ball but she won't bring it back 

559.87 561.55 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

561.70 563.59 A: yeah

589.95 591.03 A: yeah
