48.77 50.91 A: oh i didn't know that w- 

50.15 51.23 B: so 

51.21 61.76 A: yeah we got a big buy out going on here so they're saying that they're going to keep the team here and we're hoping that they will so it's a texas guy that's maybe going to buy our team 

62.44 63.34 A: so 

62.50 64.56 B: [noise] well that'll be neat 

63.93 66.18 A: yeah if he keeps it here 

65.79 67.11 B: yeah 

66.43 68.99 A: yeah if they make it a favorable uh 

69.42 70.50 A: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

71.08 77.00 A: you know concessions for him he'll keep it here but if they don't he may move the team to texas too 

73.39 74.67 B: yeah 

77.28 79.74 B: i think texas has enough 

79.77 81.30 A: yeah they do 

81.46 87.93 B: i don't think they need to bring in anymore they're going to be strapped in the pockets of texas citizens 

85.66 87.08 A: yeah 

87.11 90.02 A: yeah and that'll leave us out because we 

89.04 90.92 B: yeah 

90.12 99.09 A: we love our [mn] we love our team and um we support them as best we can uh they don't have that good a turnout unless they're winning 

99.46 101.30 A: and we don't always win 

102.25 103.19 B: yeah 

102.30 103.10 A: we 

103.41 108.19 B: cowboys hadn't done much in the last couple of years but you got to love them 

108.21 111.05 A: yeah that's how we feel we got a new um 

111.05 124.27 A: uh vic vic somebody i can't remember his name michael vick we got a new quarter back and he's so young and he seems like he's kind of carrying a ball by himself he's not getting much blocking 

124.35 126.03 A: and that's aggravating 

125.98 129.53 B: yeah but maybe with him being young he'll take it somewhere 

128.92 132.21 A: we're hoping we're hoping he's he's very strong 

132.24 136.90 A: but he's just not getting that he doesn't he's not uh co- coordinated with the team yet 

137.02 138.04 A: yeah 

137.23 142.18 B: dallas just got rid of emmett smith and sent him off to arizona cardinals 

141.71 144.86 A: oh emmett must be as old as i am [laughter] at least 

144.06 155.41 B: right and on one level i was like you know it's it's good to get rid of him 'cause he's old and he's not as fast as he used to be but on the other hand you know he's been with dallas for so long 

149.57 151.12 A: yeah yeah 

155.44 157.56 B: what are these guys going to do without him 

157.19 160.14 A: yeah yeah it seems like he would be a draw 

160.00 161.19 B: yeah 

160.41 162.88 A: because he's so famous nationally 

162.49 163.73 B: right 

163.74 178.19 B: so i- uh i- i figure it'll bring something to arizona it'll bring in a little more revenue for them 'cause i i've talked to a lot of people who are big fans of emmett smith and said that they'll no longer do anything for dallas they're switching 

166.92 168.41 A: (( so right )) 

178.48 180.60 B: to arizona they're following emmett 

180.37 186.88 A: oh my goodness isn't that something i didn't know they were that crazy of fans i stick with the team 

186.78 189.52 B: i guess it's just uh the area 

188.88 190.00 A: (( mhm )) 

189.57 193.04 B: 'cause it's oklahoma doesn't have an n._f._l. team 

193.17 194.27 A: (( mm )) 

193.50 202.15 B: and the closest we have is kansas city chiefs to the north of us the arizona cardinals to the west of us 

198.55 199.91 A: right 

201.98 203.89 A: right 

202.31 204.77 B: or the dallas cowboys to the south 

204.17 207.11 A: oh okay so that'll be good to have a team
