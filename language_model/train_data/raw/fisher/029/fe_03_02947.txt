381.41 390.00 B: yeah that's right yeah well wimbledon's quite exciting because it's played on grass and you know it's a different surface all together normally you see it mostly on a 

384.03 385.02 A: yeah 

389.85 396.20 B: hard surface or on clay or something like that but [cough] wimbledon is a little different because uh
