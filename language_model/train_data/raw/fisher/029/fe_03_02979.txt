177.09 177.72 A: (( oh )) 

177.27 187.52 B: because um you know quite a few years ago when i was getting my wisdom teeth um pulled out they were all impacted and it was a really painless surgery 

187.57 188.87 B: (( and i )) 

189.25 193.63 B: had wa- i had asked my dad for a cat i kept saying can i have a cat can i have a cat 

193.66 205.18 B: and he was sort of reticent anyway so as i am recovering on the couch after this horrible surgery um there was this crying outside the window and it just wouldn't stop 

203.06 204.02 A: mhm 

205.14 210.32 B: and i was sort of half in and half out it you know 'cause i was just coming down off all the drugs 

210.33 211.67 B: and um 

211.81 215.50 B: i i slept through the night hearing that crying 

215.14 216.26 A: oh 

215.78 224.29 B: and the next day um our wacky neighbour from upstairs came down and said there's been a cat crying outside your window this whole time you know 

224.32 233.17 B: um do you want you know is this your cat and and i couldn't even speak my face was as big as a couch and uh my dad said well yeah we'll bring her in 

233.22 243.74 B: and i had always like since i was you know six years old wanted to have an all white cat i just thought it would be so much fun but i i was always told oh they're blind or they're deaf or something 

240.41 241.65 A: mhm 

243.51 244.64 A: oh 

244.31 249.60 B: yeah and so anyway my dad walks in with this little white kitten 

249.20 250.59 A: (( no ooh )) 

249.97 252.21 B: and uh i mean she was probably 

252.48 265.69 B: she was probably about ten weeks old so she wasn't you know tiny like sitting in the palm of your hand but she was you know big enough to be perfect really [laughter] and uh he put her down on the couch and she has been with me ever since 

257.04 257.80 A: mhm 

261.20 262.21 A: yeah 

265.33 266.85 A: (( ooh )) 

266.16 275.63 B: and she just i mean it it's so rare that i mean how seriously how many times have you seen white cats you know just like for sale or whatever you 

274.97 280.95 A: right right so is your cat deaf or blind or anything [laughter] 

276.17 276.94 B: (( know so it )) 

278.97 288.09 B: no she is perfect she is just i mean she truly is a gift from god she is just the best cat i've ever had in my life 

281.37 282.15 A: (( ooh )) 

287.66 288.85 A: (( ooh )) 

288.55 292.66 B: and then when she had um kittens she um 

292.95 298.71 B: she was the the best mother i ever could have asked for you know she just really took care of them and she was 

294.07 294.61 A: (( ooh )) 

297.91 299.39 A: (( how )) 

298.76 304.70 B: she wasn't freaky she she actually told us when she was gonna have her kittens i mean it sounds so crazy but 

304.79 306.37 B: it's true you know 

306.22 307.60 A: (( interesting )) 

307.14 308.27 B: yeah 

307.67 309.25 A: how'd she do that 

309.21 316.16 B: she uh well what happened was i had been i i have had cats that had kittens before so i knew that they could be really um 

316.40 322.25 B: unruly and they could you know have the cats on your bed or have them on your favorite shoes you know just anywhere they wanted to 

321.55 323.12 A: mhm 

322.25 333.70 B: and i had been trying to train her like i i got a box out and i put my one of my shirts in it so she liked the smell and i would put her in it and i would you know talk her and say this is where you're gonna have your babies 

329.00 330.03 A: mhm 

333.12 334.06 A: [laughter] 

334.51 339.42 B: and it sounds crazy but [mn] so then i was away at work one night and um 

339.49 345.88 B: my dad said that she came up to her and was crying like he'd never heard her before 

345.99 354.39 B: and he you know he asked her what was going on and she just kept crying and he followed her into my room she jumped into the box pop out came the kittens 

353.82 355.68 A: oh my goodness 

355.01 364.00 B: and then you know a second one came out and i came home by then and i was there for the rest of the the birthing but i mean that it just like un- 

363.07 365.29 A: that is that's incredible 

364.85 365.80 B: i know 

365.89 367.27 A: aw 

366.99 371.12 B: [laughter] so when i heard that this was the topic today i'm like oh i can do this [laughter] 

370.10 375.20 A: [laughter] have you had any kind of uh medical problems with the 

374.36 377.94 B: no i mean there was one time when um 

378.06 389.54 B: she when when she had her kittens um somehow she got a fever or something like so i had to you know take her and the kittens to the doctor and i had it was funny i had to like um 

389.79 392.85 B: uh feed the babies with eye drops and 

392.05 393.56 A: oh my goodness [noise] 

393.08 401.90 B: it was prob- that's probably the hardest job you know being a being a mom because oh my god i had to feed them you know every two hours by 

401.12 402.24 A: oh 

401.91 407.58 B: the time i got done feeding all six of them it was time to feed them again [laughter] 

405.04 406.71 A: it was almost time again 

406.74 407.67 A: yeah 

408.15 412.92 B: so but otherwise no i haven't had any problems with her she's she's truly been you know a god

424.17 425.27 A: oh 

428.02 436.32 B: two of them went to [mn] a friend of mine at work she wanted to have two kittens that were you know brother and sister so she took two and then the other two 

436.33 443.69 B: my dad was really getting tired of the you know the pooping and stuff like so he just he basically got rid of them he just handed them off to somebody 

439.67 440.77 A: mhm 

443.30 444.45 A: oh 

443.92 445.86 B: which kind of bums me out but

446.41 456.86 B: um two of them were all white and um two of them were sort of tabby and then but the other two it was so funny they had these funny little black markings on their head 

456.33 457.24 A: mhm 

456.85 462.06 B: and one had a black marking that was just off to the side enough and so i called toupee 

461.94 463.12 A: (( aw [noise] ))
