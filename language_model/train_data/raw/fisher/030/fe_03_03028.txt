473.90 482.87 A: yeah actually they like kinda going out in the snow 'cause i mean you let 'em out and they just start bouncing through the snow and you'd think they'd be freezing out there 'cause i mean 

474.51 475.80 B: oh really they like 

482.80 489.14 A: but they just bounce through the snow and they play in it and you can see where they've chased each other around out there in the snow 

489.41 496.96 A: but they when it gets really cold like below zero and you know just cold and no fun to play in the snow they like to come in and lay by the fireplace 

494.89 496.00 B: (( [noise] yeah [mn] )) 

497.42 501.44 A: but they're pretty mellow they just they're getting older so they're just
