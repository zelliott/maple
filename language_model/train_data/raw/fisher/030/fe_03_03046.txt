159.37 173.42 B: i i did have a pet growing up [noise] like we always had pets you know like it was always seemed to be like a dog and a rabbit is what it seemed to be and then i i'm married now just a couple of years it'll be five years 

162.80 163.84 A: (( mm )) 

166.30 167.04 A: mm 

173.33 183.37 B: so up until like five years ago i lived with my mother [noise] and [lipsmack] we had a [noise] dog um a full bred dalmatian [noise] which of course is still at home 

181.42 182.24 A: [sigh] 

183.52 187.57 B: um she is going on she's going to be ten years

198.87 199.43 A: (( mm )) 

199.20 212.33 B: so which is kind of getting a little bit you know [noise] my mom's getting worried you know [noise] she is starting to lose like [noise] you know going to the bathroom and stuff like that [noise] like she can't help herself 

204.92 205.92 A: yeah 

209.77 210.81 A: mhm 

212.34 219.58 A: well you know i've just with locie we had the same problem and that's where the medication from the vet is helping her 

219.65 228.74 A: and we also ha- just i have blankets that i put down for her all the time she has her own special spot that she lays under the table 

222.20 223.60 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

228.76 231.81 A: and we keep blankets i took 

231.90 233.28 A: tablecloths 

233.01 234.13 B: (( uh-huh [noise] [noise] )) 

233.42 243.98 A: plastic tablecloths that are cheap put those down and put blankets over that and i can wash the blankets i do more laundry for her than i do for us 

242.76 245.46 B: [laughter] 

244.31 253.66 A: but it helped solve that problem to a certain extent as to having her mess all over the house because she is pretty much in one spot 

248.19 249.51 B: (( [laughter] [noise] [noise] ah )) 

253.63 254.79 B: uh-huh 

253.90 258.29 A: and we still do some cleaning up here and there but [cough] 

257.39 258.63 B: right 

258.65 263.54 A: um the vet the vet has medication that did definitely help with that 

259.30 260.15 B: well that's 

262.78 269.69 B: oh see i know my mom i guess is taking her i know she has an appointment to take her i think her hearing is also going 

269.30 270.36 A: mhm 

269.73 281.63 B: i don't know if that seems to be i think my mom said that's like a common thing in dalmatians too because you know like when you'd ring the door bell she would always come like flying down the steps you know you know how it you know how dogs are 

274.83 275.81 A: mhm 

278.88 279.92 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

280.81 282.14 A: exactly 

281.58 287.93 B: you know but now i guess she kinda doesn't even bother until you're actually like like in the room with her 

288.15 288.77 A: (( mm )) 

288.16 291.85 B: so i don't know if it's like how far she hears 

291.90 296.21 B: [noise] you know or what it is now i don't know if there's anything they could do for that 

296.00 302.99 A: again the medication did help locie in some ways with that she does seem to hear better 

302.89 304.50 B: (( oh [noise] )) 

303.39 308.57 A: it didn't bring it completely but it she does seem to hear better now 

308.14 311.31 B: was this like a pill that you gave her [noise] [noise] [noise] 

308.69 309.46 A: so 

311.00 319.66 A: the the first visit he gave her a shot and then we could opt to either give her a pill morning and evening or to 

319.77 331.49 A: have her come back for a shot once a week well the pills are well pills are really easy and ah ah medication costs us thirteen dollars a week which isn't bad 

321.60 322.47 B: [noise] 

322.72 325.93 B: oh every week okay [noise] [noise] 

330.91 332.36 B: no [noise] 

331.98 342.69 A: and it's um we just she gets used to it she gets her hotdog in the morning she gets one piece with a pill and one piece without so she's a happy 

342.51 347.58 B: [noise] [noise] yeah well that's good do you see where they have insurance for pets now 

344.95 345.75 A: yeah 

347.43 349.59 A: i can't afford that 

348.87 359.23 B: [laughter] i never had checked on it but i just i just had thought of it when you said about the price of the pills [noise] [sigh] i thought like getting health insurance for your pet i'm thinking oh my goodness 

355.00 355.84 A: right 

357.60 358.67 A: mhm 

358.97 362.53 A: [laughter] yeah well we felt 

359.53 361.36 B: that's hysterical 

361.45 362.28 B: so you're 

362.63 363.85 A: no go ahead 

362.97 366.40 B: your your cats are all healthy [noise] 

366.13 374.04 A: yes they're doing very well squash is not showing much sign of aging other than tooth loss 

374.07 382.02 A: she has lost some teeth and raven who is the other older cat she's about ten now 

382.07 384.93 A: they've lost their fangs 

385.19 391.12 A: both of 'em so we feed them more moist cat food now and we separate everybody 

391.09 403.64 A: so that squash and raven each we make sure that they get their food so they get moist food and then we have dry food down all the time for them so they can nibble whenever they want to 

395.98 397.59 B: [noise] mhm [noise]
