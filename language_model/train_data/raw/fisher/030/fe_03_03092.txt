355.39 362.29 A: well that's that's you know that's pretty good 'cause she's mixed with something else smaller 'cause the big dogs don't live as long

393.70 394.53 B: oh 

397.84 405.10 B: well this one had bad teeth show you how mu- [laughter] how much we care about her she had some bad teeth 

405.27 417.27 B: and she even had a bump below her eye it was abscessed so bad and the vet told us the antibiotic wouldn't take care of it and we'd have to get 'em pulled and 

416.62 417.53 A: (( [mn] ooh )) 

417.98 418.87 A: (( ooh )) 

418.24 424.50 B: it it cost us a pretty penny but i i balled and balled and balled i couldn't let her die [mn] 

423.89 424.91 A: no 

425.37 432.98 A: yeah i i was amazed at how expensive it was to have dental work done on a dog 'cause they have to knock 'em out for everything even just to brush their teeth you 

432.75 434.19 B: yeah i know 

433.39 436.41 A: know and that anesthesia's expensive 

436.14 441.94 B: well they cau- charged us about three hundred almost three hundred dollars to you know for everything 

442.25 456.07 A: i i think my vet told me it's really funny 'cause she never revisited it she told me about three years ago oh she's got some bad teeth we're going to have to do some work you know she's never brought it up again i started buying those um what are those those dental bones that are supposed to remove tartar 

455.78 458.85 B: yeah i been getting them off and on lately too 

458.24 472.23 A: i give her one once once a month you know and she loves it and i even asked my vet i was just there i said how's the tartar she said oh her teeth look great are you brushing 'em [laughter] i thought well no [laughter] like she'd let me brush her teeth 

468.03 469.55 B: [laughter] 

472.11 482.30 A: but um apparently those things work pretty good 'cause you know i didn't have to and she was telling me i was gonna have to have probably have two teeth pulled on on the dog and now it's three years later and they're fine 

478.80 479.61 B: (( oh )) 

482.01 487.87 B: oh that's good um this one will let me brush 'em she she doesn't like it but she'll let me 

483.03 484.12 A: yeah 

487.73 489.58 A: oh really i don't know 

488.43 490.65 B: yeah it i i 

489.88 490.69 A: (( i don't know )) 

490.91 496.96 B: i got some regular toothpaste for dogs and it says it says people toothpaste will upset their stomachs 

491.11 491.95 A: go ahead 

493.64 494.67 A: (( oh okay )) 

497.50 498.32 A: (( oh )) 

498.19 501.03 B: 'cause of the i think because of the fluoride 

500.47 501.45 A: oh 

501.58 509.87 A: you know that's possible i i don't know i don't brush her teeth i just i bought these bones and but they were the easy way out because [laughter] i don't think she'd let me [mn] 

509.48 516.01 B: [mn] well i wouldn't i can't do the cat i think i'd come back with a bloody hand if i tried to do her [laughter] 

515.95 517.68 A: so how old is the cat 

517.79 520.88 B: um she's about ten i think 

521.09 523.21 A: is it just a you know generic 

523.32 530.60 B: yeah she was a drop off she was a she was a oh um this one though she was a real small kitten
