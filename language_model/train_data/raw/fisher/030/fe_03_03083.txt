92.94 95.71 B: did you say that it's part tibetan terrier 

95.33 96.39 A: yes 

96.05 110.34 B: i've never heard of that breed i i have relatives in both sides of the family that bred terriers uh one side boston terriers and one side wire hair but i've never heard of a tibetan terrier how wh- what type of dog is that how is that what's that bred for normally 

110.07 117.19 A: you know i i don't know much about dog breeding but ah they're usually grey and white and their hair grows 

117.29 120.35 A: oh i can guess it grows up to ten inches 

119.90 120.80 B: okay 

120.44 133.16 A: we keep her clipped just because it's easier so it's sort of a benji looking dog um she has the short legs i don't know where those come from um tibetan terriers usually have legs 

132.36 133.79 B: (( [mn] you )) 

133.16 141.26 A: ten to twelve inches her's are more like seven or eight and she's got this big fluffy tail that that winds up over the top of her hair 

141.31 150.40 A: ah big brown eyes bushy crazy hair um everyone says she should be in the movies she's a disney dog so it's um 

150.96 158.95 A: you know she doesn't shed and ah she's just an angel she does everything we ask her to do if she starts walking down the street i say 

159.58 164.45 A: what are you doing come back here honey she just looks at me and says oh oh okay 

164.60 169.52 B: know that's interesting for terriers because terriers usually are not very um 

169.65 175.39 B: are not very um ah submissive dogs usually the terriers that i've had experience with 

175.48 179.38 B: were very very independent and extremely stubborn 

177.67 178.61 A: uh-huh 

179.44 193.52 A: yeah this is what we've heard too although we've had a neighbor that had a full bred tibetan terrier she was very docile so i but then the neighbor over here in in this neighborhood um that dog would run away what a pain in the neck 

184.24 185.18 B: okay 

193.72 199.81 A: you know more of a traditional terrier i think whatever the herding dog the sheepdog that she has in her 

199.99 204.59 A: or maybe her experience um she was getting ready to get put down 

204.32 205.20 B: ooh 

204.72 209.22 A: you know something happened to her in her life i think she was probably always pretty sweet but 

209.62 212.50 A: you know sh- i think she's really appreciative 

212.57 216.91 B: yeah when you say herder are you talking about like one of those um 

217.51 220.27 B: [lipsmack] the border collie type or or 

219.80 231.26 A: when i ask her to go get the kitty she's she's really sweet they're great friends um she herds him up against the wall and she's always trying to herd people over right or left 

222.08 222.74 B: (( mm )) 

224.26 225.19 B: okay 

225.22 225.78 B: (( [mn] )) 

230.52 232.96 B: yeah that sounds like a border collie mix 

232.47 236.24 A: yeah yeah but border collies of course have longer legs 

235.95 248.73 B: yeah but they have they have extremely high high herding in- inst- instincts about of all the oth- of all the dogs that are h- herders they tend to be the most aggressive in terms of just literally not letting you walk in a straight line 

248.68 256.35 A: yeah no she do- and when i run i mean unfortunately she likes to you know kind of get in front of my feet [laughter] 

248.80 249.82 B: (( it's y- )) 

255.62 261.38 B: yeah that's that's a breed characteristic also the a a border collie is one of the most intelligent 

261.50 262.97 B: (( of all breeds )) 

263.16 274.79 A: we- well maybe maybe there's something to that you know in her um but anyway she's she's a great little addition we've really lucked out with her especially since we took her we were um 

274.90 285.06 A: we were doing foster care and she was she was going down for the count she had bacterial and viral infection and they said they didn't think she would make it but could we help out with her 

280.23 281.93 B: ooh nasty 

285.10 286.99 B: boy that must have been brutal 

287.15 289.17 B: (( that must have been absolutely brutal )) 

287.26 294.68 A: yeah we had some of these dogs she's so cute that the the rescue people thought well if she makes it through this 

294.81 296.91 A: she'll she'll be a great pet 

296.77 298.42 B: and how old is she now 

298.23 299.69 A: she's five 

299.97 302.38 B: how about the cat what kind of cat 

302.11 307.58 A: well the cat um unfortunately it's it's not a rescue cat it's a full 

307.69 310.22 A: bred um manx 

310.27 314.84 B: oh that's an interesting one i haven't seen too many of them they're the tailless breed right 

314.26 321.06 A: oh let me tell you a a neighbor had the most beautiful cat i'd ever seen a manx um 

318.84 319.80 B: okay 

320.08 320.92 B: yeah 

321.11 332.05 A: beautiful champagne color with brown striking brown features the most unflappable sweetest gentle sociable cat i have ever seen 

323.59 324.30 B: (( oh )) 

332.56 340.43 A: and so we live in the bay area and they drove about three hours up towards lake tahoe to buy her from this breeder which was this 

337.94 338.91 B: okay 

340.55 349.96 A: eighty five year old woman who lived on a farm up up in the mountains she bred um manx cats and miniature ponies 

345.40 346.93 B: (( oh that sounds nice )) 

349.58 350.47 B: wow 

350.41 361.81 A: so we went up there to get her this cat's brother you know from another litter and it was like going to fairy land i have a an eight year old daughter and it was just unbelievable 

361.81 366.17 A: the ponies and the kitties you know it was like [laughter] 

365.35 367.65 B: sounds like a very dedicated breeder 

367.49 369.59 A: well you know she's 

369.61 380.97 A: she doesn't have a lot but she loves loves these animals and so we got this little guy and he's about a year old and he is just as precious and as sweet 

381.18 385.24 A: and loving as you can get and gorgeous 

384.77 386.55 B: and how did you hear about her 

386.71 396.53 A: um from my neighbor down the street and i don't know how they heard about her i guess they got online or something looking for a breeder and she was advertised or in a back of a kitty magazine or something 

396.63 406.27 B: well that's important to get ah t- to get a reputable breeder i've known a few people that have bought purebred animals not not cats but dogs 

406.39 414.44 B: and with a lot of the with a lot of the dogs they get if the breeds get too popular or you don't go to the right breeder you can have a lot of genetic problems 

414.42 427.91 A: well i i don't really believe in breeders but this cat was just the cat down the street was just so lovely and i had just gotten our last cat from the pound and he kept running away 

419.87 420.69 B: yeah 

427.85 434.25 A: and i had a kitty for fourteen years who died and then we got him and he just kept running away and then he was gone 

433.89 435.60 B: wow that's terrible 

435.18 443.00 A: so my first cat that i had for fifteen years i got from the pound and she was always sick all the time she got kitty croup earlier on 

441.00 441.89 B: wow 

442.82 447.09 B: that one i never heard of kitty croup is that a very dangerous disease [mn] 

446.56 454.20 A: i don't know it's something like an asthma thing but she she went down for the count the vet told me that she was dead three times 

453.59 456.71 B: oh damn that's something awful i never even heard of it 

456.19 466.11 A: oh my and th- the money i spent on her and they kept wanting me to put her on steroids and i finally said i'm not doing it to this cat she's too sweet it's going to kill her anyway 

466.22 468.05 A: and so she lived to fifteen 

468.06 475.28 B: but did they ah did they tell you where that comes from is it a genetic thing or infectious or what is kitty croup i've never heard of it 

473.58 477.95 A: they thought it she caught it from the pound 

477.76 480.38 B: oh my god that's wild 

479.20 484.75 A: so i severe asthma kitty you know kennel cough that type of thing 

484.47 487.87 B: (( i heard of kennel cough but i thought that was a dog disease )) 

485.73 487.24 A: yeah well that's that's what 

487.30 490.64 A: yeah that's that's kind of what i was talking about but um 

490.30 491.38 B: yeah 

490.79 494.05 A: it turned into like a a pretty severe thing 

493.58 495.42 B: oh that sucks you know 

494.48 501.43 A: but she lasted fifteen years and she was precious and i didn't put her on steroids and that's probably why she lasted so long 

501.43 508.11 B: yeah well sometimes you know it- it's sometimes things are a crap shoot you do everything you're supposed to do and you have bad luck 

508.14 514.06 B: and sometimes you do everything that they tell you not to do an- and ah it turns out fantastic
