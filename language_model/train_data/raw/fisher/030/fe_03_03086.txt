108.40 120.71 B: we want him as a house dog even though he's going to be big he's short haired so it will be um it won't be as bad as the other dog that we had so anyway 

120.58 127.35 A: yeah if you have a furry one then you spend all your time if he's inside cleaning up after it or cleaning off your clothes 

125.14 126.46 B: that's that's true 

126.62 135.84 B: that's true we just we just had to put our other dog to sleep because he was old and um he um had ah 

136.24 137.76 B: ah some um

147.59 152.13 A: you know you have 'em so long and you have to put 'em down it it hurts you worse than them i think [laughter] 

151.33 153.69 B: it does it does uh-huh 

153.42 154.95 A: yeah that's so 

155.01 156.04 B: (( we ah ))

159.53 161.00 B: and but ah 

161.04 165.37 B: our other dog we kept food out for him all the time because he was an outside dog 

164.80 170.51 A: oh right yeah 'cause you don't know when they're hungry or whether they're finding something themselves to eat somewhere or 

165.78 166.65 B: so 

170.13 171.68 B: that's right uh-huh 

171.70 179.80 B: now um we when we bought this dog we were given the information that we should only feed him um 

180.07 180.92 B: ah 

182.39 188.42 B: dog food that that we buy and preferably a brand called eukenuba 

187.93 190.08 A: [laughter] oh yes i've heard of that uh-huh 

189.41 198.13 B: and it's very expensive but they say it grows better on that the dog ah thrives better on it and um 

196.30 197.04 A: (( hm )) 

198.35 202.80 B: then also and it shouldn't eat people food it they said 

202.83 207.66 A: well yeah but everybody feeds their dogs' table scraps that's bad i know but [laughter] 

203.08 203.95 B: but

228.36 230.14 B: yes well 

229.39 230.56 A: actually can be 

230.66 232.04 A: toxic to them 

230.66 231.71 B: yeah my 

231.87 239.06 B: my son was reading about it and he said that um he ah found out that it should be good for him 

238.95 240.33 A: oh well that's good 

239.47 245.10 B: so so that's good mhm now if we can get him to eat apples that would be nice [laughter] 

244.64 250.43 A: yeah w- y- you don't have to they they grow plentiful up here so you don't have to worry about [laughter] 

249.62 254.00 B: that's right um ah we have a son that lives in wenatchee

336.87 345.35 A: yeah i guess we're supposed to be are we supposed to be talking about dogs the whole time yeah i i just didn't want to i didn't want to get in trouble with anybody out there you know [laughter] 

339.67 342.06 B: yes yes we're supposed to be talking about 

344.06 350.97 B: well i don't either i don't either so ah what ah what dog do you plan what kind of dog to get 

345.77 346.68 A: right 

349.22 359.49 A: well we're my husband and i are kinda so far we haven't really decided and i kinda grew up with dachshunds and i've had dachshunds and i you know if i had my druthers i'd want a dachshund and 

359.33 367.28 A: he kinda ha- has had bad experiences with 'em so we're probably gonna settle on something else we're kinda looking at mayb- maybe something like a ah a 

367.85 380.03 A: shih-tzu or a lhasa apso or a we- we've seen like a bichon frise they're just beautiful but ah they may be too big for us we don't know so we're just kind of we're still on the kind of the wishful thinking stage you know [laughter] 

379.55 380.94 B: mhm mhm 

380.11 390.19 A: we get down to the last year we've got the names of a couple of bichon breeders that are up in this area and there was another one that i came across and i can't remember it was a cross between 

385.36 386.21 B: (( oh ah )) 

390.72 395.45 A: um i'm trying to between a shar pei and something else i can't remember 

395.95 399.16 A: that ah we saw the the puppies online 

399.36 400.28 B: oh 

399.43 406.03 A: and my husband put it away somewhere but it it was a cross breed and they were the cutest puppies i can't remember what the other breed was 

405.75 406.91 B: well 

406.12 408.67 A: they were just little tiny ones not very big 

408.46 409.50 B: oh 

409.10 417.19 A: but they were ah you know the puppies they had like six or eight of the different puppies on on their website and the puppies were just gorgeous 

414.78 415.65 B: (( mm )) 

416.89 418.88 B: oh oh that'd be fun to ha- 

417.71 421.10 A: and i can't rem- i can't remember what the mix was now 

421.06 421.74 B: (( mm )) 

421.28 430.66 A: and just for the life of me i can't i know my husband put notes on it put it away we have like a little a little retirement folder we're starting for things we want to do after we retire [laughter] 

429.67 431.80 B: oh well that's a good idea 

431.16 441.76 A: right so he put that away so well we really nobody would i w- i work part time during the day so we real- really wouldn't be available to take care of beyond especially a new puppy to get it trained so 

431.94 432.71 B: uh-huh 

441.03 442.24 B: oh uh-huh 

441.91 443.34 A: when i retire 

443.63 445.14 B: then you would 

444.49 450.69 A: then there'll be somebody here to give it the attention that it needs and to be able to walk it and all that kind of stuff 

447.58 448.91 B: mhm 

449.70 453.51 B: oh well a puppy needs a a lot of attention 

452.95 454.27 A: right 

453.81 455.17 B: (( mhm )) 

454.36 460.26 A: yeah they need the attention so yeah we'd probably just we'd just as well get a puppy rather than kinda get something that somebody's already 

460.19 463.26 B: yep right trained to their ah ways 

462.29 466.01 A: to their needs or given it bad habits or fears or whatever 

465.35 466.90 B: right right uh-huh 

466.16 467.36 A: [laughter] 

467.21 470.99 B: we used to have a little peekapoo that was really cute yeah 

470.98 482.31 A: [cough] you know i'm thinking that that maybe that's i can't remember whether it was a poodle mixed with it i can't remember what you know i i'll have to look that into those notes up now it's got my own curiosity 'cause i can't remember what they were mixed with 

482.16 487.71 B: well they're they're nice dogs to have any dog that's part poodle because it doesn't shed 

487.69 488.89 A: right 

488.58 489.83 B: so uh-huh 

489.99 493.45 B: so anyway she she got old and so 

493.99 496.74 B: she had to be put to sleep too [mn] 

496.43 501.28 A: i know it's t- it's sad you know you keep the dogs for a long time but they 

501.49 512.87 A: they especially if they get one of those you know some kind of a internal problem i think like it it's just more than most more you know usually you don't know about it too they're too physically ill to 

505.58 507.65 B: right mhm 

513.57 515.04 A: know what to do with it 

514.61 516.53 B: mhm that's true that's true 

515.79 520.73 A: and sometimes you know if you're economically challenged it's more than your budget can handle [laughter] 

520.47 523.00 B: (( that's right yeah that's right )) 

521.94 522.78 A: (( now )) 

522.96 536.08 A: now do have you ever have you ever used the pet insurance that they have out there now that you can get like through the um i know the ah pet co up here you know has a sign up you know that you can buy it's like health insurance for your pets 

535.68 545.71 B: well no we haven't but we've been thinking about it for this dog because he was the a little more than what we had planned to spend on a dog [mn] 

544.92 548.63 A: that's what we were thinking too if we spend very much you just i mean it's 

548.85 560.42 A: you know it's better to have that and even if you pay out a hundred or two hundred a year than to have a emergency where you need a me- expensive surgery and you know you love the dog and you can't keep it because you just can't afford it 

559.15 562.82 B: that's true and then we hope to maybe ah 

562.85 567.60 B: ah breed our dog or you know have um whatever they call it 

564.82 565.87 A: (( oh uh-huh )) 

567.65 578.17 B: um do that service and ah so i think in order to do that that you have to um do you ah h- have to have insurance on it i wonder 

578.40 584.32 A: that you th- ah that you probably would want to check with other breeders and see what kind of 

584.60 592.41 A: ah you know breeding liability or whatever that might be through a regular insurance provider i really don't know now is your dog a female or a male 

590.18 591.26 B: well we'll have to 

592.11 593.39 B: it's a male 

592.85 596.48 A: it's a male okay so you want to have one that stud service then probably 

593.60 594.62 B: yeah 

595.70 598.86 B: yeah that's what you call it uh mhm 

597.46 599.95 A: right yeah you that you would have
