84.58 86.59 B: in a dorm 

85.65 87.30 A: yeah i'm a college student 

87.35 88.63 B: where at 

88.46 90.27 A: ah university of pennsylvania 

90.09 93.16 B: oh i'm in california silicon valley 

92.57 93.51 A: (( all right )) 

94.37 95.27 B: so 

94.62 95.50 A: yeah 

95.54 98.89 A: there's um [lipsmack] the dean on housing here 

99.09 104.05 A: i- she ha- she lives with her husband and they took in some ah greyhound dogs 

104.27 108.10 A: they have two of them so they're allowed becau- 'cause they live in the in the dorm they're 

108.21 113.81 A: (( allowed to to have pets 'cause you know they're kind of just living you know like a so they're trying to live like a normal family )) 

111.59 112.70 B: right 

113.87 118.33 A: but yeah every like al- every time they go to walk them like you'll see them in the elevators 

118.51 123.96 A: either going up or down and they're just lying down [laughter] but i think its like they're they're pretty 

118.94 119.68 B: (( mm )) 

124.02 135.90 A: old and so i think its like the greyhounds that he saves from the races or or save after they've raced and they're you know instead of sacrificing them they they take 'em to orphanages and i think that that's what they are because they're so 

136.12 141.88 A: docile and they don't they i i've yet to hear them bark i mean [laughter] they're just so you know 

140.88 143.85 B: mm grey- greyhounds generally don't bark but 

143.77 145.88 A: (( oh really okay guess that's just )) 

145.26 148.62 B: they're quiet dogs but yes they they could be rescues 

149.11 153.16 B: so my onl- my only experience with pets in a dorm is a friend of mine 

153.75 158.40 B: was ah putting peanuts on his balcony for the squirrels 

158.30 159.09 A: (( oh oh )) 

159.15 167.77 B: and then he succeeded in actually trapping a squirrel inside his dorm room and he said that's cool and then he then he went to class 

164.37 165.45 A: my god 

167.78 169.03 A: (( mhm the )) 

168.76 173.83 B: and when he came back the squirrel had trashed the room [laughter] 

173.12 174.83 A: room i'm sure 

174.63 179.10 B: [laughter] i had no idea that a squirrel could do that much damage 

175.53 176.38 A: [laughter] 

179.19 180.02 A: oh 

179.26 187.77 B: the curtains were down the bed was ripped apart the pillows were all over the room it was just the squirrel had himself a fit 

187.80 188.91 A: wow 

188.60 191.67 B: and as soon as they opened the window poof he's gone 

191.59 192.99 A: right of course 

193.63 194.94 B: [sigh] 

193.91 199.35 A: that's funny i guess i never heard the stories about don't try and keep squirrels as pets [laughter] 

199.38 203.06 B: well he was he was just goofing around but 

203.15 204.53 B: got his lesson 

204.53 206.08 A: yeah well 

206.62 214.64 B: so ah do you know anything about this group about the are they doing like voice ah language studies or 

214.04 219.71 A: um it sounds that way more like language but in terms of how people get to know each other 

219.95 221.56 B: oh interesting 

220.96 230.28 A: yeah tha- when i was reading it online that's what it it sounds like and so i think the previous study that they did before they just had people meet and then they just had to talk about a- anything 

230.20 243.01 A: and how you know how people would talk and get to know each other and i think now they're trying to put a little twist on it and give people a certain topic to talk about i still this is my third time doing this and i'm still not quite sure if [lipsmack] 

231.76 233.28 B: right just ju- 

238.10 239.89 B: see how long they stay on this 

243.43 256.11 A: we're supposed to stay on the topic for as long as that we poss- for as long as we possibly can for the full ten minutes or if we just use that as a stepping block to start a -sation and then kind of go on you know and talk about whatever to just 

255.50 267.27 B: yeah its its i i think i- if its natural language processing then they're looking at the the directions um c- communication goes and doing communication analysis 

256.33 257.18 A: (( kind of thing )) 

265.46 266.52 A: right 

267.43 271.69 B: interesting stuff i've i'm actually got into this because i 

267.62 268.30 A: (( right )) 

271.71 278.83 B: work with the group that does the ah voice recognition ah voice to text software 

278.92 280.11 A: oh oh 

279.11 281.37 B: here and ah 

281.93 282.91 B: you know they're 

283.38 287.97 B: th- that stuff has been making leaps and bounds forward and it's 

288.10 292.83 B: it's getting to the point where you know there's there's potential that ah 

293.56 307.75 B: it it's not you're not going to be able to carry it in your pocket yet it's still about you need about a two hundred watt processor to do it but you can do it in real time i mean you can have it producing text as fa- as fast as a person talks 

300.91 301.71 A: okay 

307.60 308.85 A: wow 

309.27 310.53 B: [sigh] at about 

309.83 311.08 A: (( that's incredible )) 

310.75 320.34 B: two hundred watts but that's that's a lot of power but you can still use a system where you you know you call something on the phone and copy it in and text it out and 

319.75 321.08 A: right 

320.84 321.98 B: so there's 

321.99 328.64 B: there's going to be a a real breakthrough in about five or ten years when they figure out how to do it you know and 

327.38 328.27 A: right 

328.86 330.64 B: every person carries a 

331.40 335.74 B: a voice detect- and instead of typing we'll all start just talking 

335.16 336.28 A: right 

336.32 341.98 A: wow that's great i am i'm taking a sign language class here at penn it's my last year here 

340.69 341.68 B: yeah 

342.13 350.76 A: and so like i decided to do something that i might actually have fun [laughter] doing i'm a bio engineering major so a lot of my classes haven't been too much like fun necessarily 

350.13 351.68 B: [laughter] 

350.90 365.31 A: [laughter] so yeah i'm taking this class and of course it ends up being one of the like the best class i've taken here just because i find that like it was going to class is like not a bore like or a chore kind of thing like i actually wanted to go to class and learn more 

365.24 375.94 A: and if you do do that i know that that'll be great just for like the deaf community because th- in terms o- right now they have a relay system if a deaf person wants to talk to a hearing person 

375.82 381.38 A: then they need to get get um do a relay system where there's an operator who's in between who 

380.77 382.10 B: right 

381.51 391.81 A: reads the message that the deaf person types in to their t. p. y. and then tells it to the hearing person and then vice versa the p- the hearing person tells her or him and then they type it in 

390.68 392.75 B: a- access to communication 

392.64 393.93 A: right exactly 

393.90 394.83 B: no i w- 

393.99 400.62 A: yeah i mean just because i just came out of this sign language class that was my first reaction like wow if you could do that there would be no reason for 

400.63 402.57 A: the relaying system [laughter] 

401.96 405.67 B: yeah well i imagine that these new text phones are 

405.75 410.86 B: probably ah coming out one thing i thought was interesting about that whole issue is 

411.07 421.58 B: um i read a paper a few years back about someone who had gone into this and learned sign language and started working in it and said that um 

421.75 424.44 B: there is a cultural difference 

424.30 425.25 A: (( mhm )) 

425.00 430.50 B: um between deaf society and um regular americans 

430.16 443.02 A: no ah there is that's the biggest thing that we learned the the culture and that they're a proud culture and they're proud of who they are and stuff i tried to say this to my parents but the thing is is is that hearing people without 

443.32 453.39 A: taking a class or without learning about the culture they see it as a disability they see that being deaf you're disabled like it's a complete disability you're just disabled and why wouldn't you want to hear 

453.44 464.04 A: but for them its like its who they are and not necessarily that they're disabled because they're still proud of the fact that they can get on in the same world that we're living in and just as fine you know like 

463.96 474.69 A: they can still they still have friends they still party they still shop they still own their own houses they still drive th- you know what i mean like i- for them its not really a handicap necessarily you know what i mean 'cause they can still 

473.19 475.51 B: yeah it's it's a cultural difference 

475.23 480.56 A: right exactly and so i- its i mean your friend is absolutely right i mean i think that's something 

481.07 487.31 A: when you learn its kind of fascinating 'cause you didn't realize that it was that they see themselves as a completely different culture 

487.27 490.71 B: and there was a there was a p._b._s. show on 

487.57 488.19 A: (( mm )) 

490.77 499.37 B: the co- the the fight about ah cochlea implants r- actually repairing deaf some deaf people are against it saying that you know 

497.99 500.16 A: yeah a a lot of people are actually 

499.69 502.67 B: you know that they don't they don't want the change over 

502.63 513.65 A: right no well this um w- we had a a talk where this woman the first ah deaf principal of the p- school the pennsylvania school for the deaf she came to talk 

503.22 503.99 B: (( so )) 

513.00 515.11 B: the one in washington d._c. 

514.81 519.29 A: no no it's the pennsylvania school for the deaf like more of like a high school kind of thing 

516.61 517.76 B: oh okay 

519.31 527.55 A: and so she came to talk to us and she basically said that this is a discussion that gets talked about a lot within the deaf community and the thing is for them 

527.78 536.65 A: it's like oh instead of saying okay cochlea implants they make it easier like if you could take a pill like a magic pill that would just make you hear would you take it and a lot of them are like 

536.71 545.81 A: very like strong in the belief that no i would not take it 'cause that's like you start taking me away from the culture that i have lived in that i love to be in like the people that i know 

545.81 552.07 A: and this one one of the deaf professors who was who was also there 'cause ah all levels of sign language classes 

552.12 554.51 A: all the professors were there for the talk 

554.73 568.78 A: and he one of them he he's a black man and he said like honestly he was like he could not take it because for him taking that pill would be like a pill to make him white and like he j- wh- he doesn't feel the need to make him like everyone like to take a pill to make him like everyone else because 

568.71 571.46 A: that's how strong it is for him the belief that he is 

571.25 579.12 A: that deafness is a part of a culture just as much as being black is for him is being part of a certain culture and i think that's what made it to me 

576.90 578.41 B: (( hm )) 

578.89 586.80 A: i think that was the statement that said it all for me that made me totally understand ah wow that's how strong it is like that's how strong the belief is that 

586.68 596.84 B: well that that leads to interesting things down the future because causes of deafness are fading ah for instance one thing that helen keller 

587.03 588.11 A: (( the both of them )) 

596.91 599.95 B: is famous for is her work with the blind and
