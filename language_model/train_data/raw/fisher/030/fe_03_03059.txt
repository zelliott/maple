128.87 142.81 A: yeah well i if i have a big dog i would prefer to have like a golden retriever i just love their personalities and you know just a nice family pet i the the rotties seem to be high maintenance you know 

135.34 136.45 B: uh 

142.27 145.05 B: yeah i wanna get a rottie for myself you know 

144.23 153.65 A: yeah yeah and if you're real active and get out there and you know do the hiking and all that stuff they love i think that's nice but i think people need to be tailored to 

153.71 158.54 A: their animals instead of making the animals tailored to them you know so 

155.47 156.54 B: oh yeah 

158.81 163.17 B: [noise] so many people that's why you see so many um pure breeds go to back to the pound 

162.83 170.79 A: yeah well when we were looking for we named him bentley when we were looking for um a new you know puppy 

170.93 176.99 A: i started looking for the actual adoption areas that they have for pure breeds 

176.98 178.50 B: yeah that's what i did too 

177.21 177.85 A: (( and )) 

178.22 185.02 A: yeah i was shocked how many people just give 'em up it's really sad that i'm glad 

180.65 181.58 B: mhm 

183.53 185.90 B: because the the yeah 

185.85 187.14 A: (( you know i i'm )) 

186.28 191.05 B: like you said i'm sorry the dog doesn't fit the lifestyle at all and they end up taking it back 

189.67 190.63 A: yeah 

190.80 195.38 A: yeah so and it's so hard to find the small breeds 

195.33 196.35 B: mhm 

195.42 206.64 A: you know they're uh it's very i don't know where you're at but the popular breed around here is like the um cattle dog you know and or the border collie and 

205.44 207.42 B: oh like a yeah like a spaniel 

207.08 216.91 A: yeah yeah so it's a mid sized dog and we wanted smaller than that and it was horrible trying to find something that didn't you know cost [mn] 

208.08 209.01 B: mhm 

217.09 220.25 A: 'cause you to go in debt to get one but 

219.35 224.76 B: right yeah i imagine it would be because you don't really see smaller dogs in pounds now that i think of it 

222.47 223.70 A: mhm 

223.71 233.37 A: [noise] yeah and you know you pay mightily for them too like at pet stores and whatnot and i don't know that kinda turns me off but we were able to find him 

228.63 229.57 B: oh yeah 

233.35 246.98 A: from private um breeders and you know checked him out and talked to them a few times and then we had to go all the way to climus falls to get him so [laughter] he's the million dollar puppy [laughter] 

244.33 245.27 B: (( [noise] [noise] man )) 

246.02 252.44 B: [laughter] i actually got my dog when i had her i got her through seattle purebred adoption rescue 

247.13 248.78 A: yeah so

257.08 259.02 B: they're great family dogs 

258.53 269.44 A: uh-huh yeah he's just you know he's so entertaining and i was kinda worried with you know little dogs they kinda get yappy and persnickety and i was worried about him 

262.93 264.23 B: oh i bet 

267.16 268.14 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

269.33 278.75 A: with the little kids but he he prefers them if anything you know he tolerates other people he is attached to me at the hip and you know he likes the family but 

278.59 286.64 A: when little kids come to visit boy he just latches right on to them so i was glad about that 'cause you know you just never know 

284.66 291.89 B: yeah the bulldog i had too they they love kids they just adore children so much 

286.93 287.90 A: yeah

290.85 291.77 A: yeah 

291.80 293.77 A: and that's important you know 

292.14 295.93 B: and then kids get a kick out of him because you know the wrinkles and everything 

295.34 299.38 A: uh-huh [laughter] it was what was it a sharpei

316.19 323.90 B: oh i adopted her when she was five and i had her till she was twelve so a long time yeah bulldogs are only supposed to go about eight to ten years 

319.73 321.72 A: oh wow wow 

323.63 326.75 A: so she yeah that was a nice life span then 

325.99 333.78 B: yeah and i felt i felt really lucky really lucky and she she you know people are surprised i mean it's a big dog but wi- with short feet 

328.67 329.37 A: mm 

333.34 334.35 A: (( uh-huh [laughter] ))

335.96 336.73 A: yeah 

337.09 341.39 A: yeah that's it now and you know if that's what you want is a house 

341.32 349.05 A: pet i think that's what they need to be or people dogs you know that want to be with you mhm and i hate it when 

344.61 347.36 B: right you don't leave it outside 

348.96 356.95 A: they're the type that want to be around people and then the people work and then you know the dog suffers mhm mhm so 

353.83 362.51 B: throw it out yeah well that's what is good about these people is that you know they do work during the day and then i come over about one o'clock 

360.20 361.00 A: (( right )) 

362.16 363.16 A: uh-huh 

362.99 365.62 B: and then take the dog out and uh 

364.46 368.80 A: is is that something that a lot of people do there have people come in and 

368.84 371.20 A: pet sit or whatever i mean i 

370.54 372.10 B: yeah i think so 

371.26 371.93 A: (( in )) 

372.29 375.92 A: a big area like you're in you know that would be something 

374.93 376.65 B: yeah it's pretty popular 

376.24 378.91 A: yeah i would think i would think yeah 

378.48 387.09 B: you know especially [mn] you know depending on where you live i mean they have a a house with a fenced yard but they still want to crate train her so 

383.85 384.83 A: uh-huh 

386.57 388.32 A: right right 

387.43 390.14 B: and she's a puppy so you don't want to leave her outside all day 

389.65 395.74 A: yeah well and then they start to chew and the anxiety stuff that they go through it's sad so 

390.93 392.05 B: and so 

393.33 394.50 B: mhm 

395.35 405.84 B: right so they're crating her during the day even though they have the fenced yard and then i come um in the middle of the day and let her out and we walk and we play in the yard 

395.85 397.78 A: yeah especially 

400.24 401.23 A: uh-huh 

405.98 419.31 B: 'cause she really can't walk too far i mean she can but her attention span is just not enough yet [laughter] [laughter] we usually walk about i don't know ten blocks or so you know about twenty twenty thirty minutes and that's that's good for her 

411.18 413.21 A: yeah yeah 

418.96 422.26 A: mhm well you do the training for her too or 

419.96 420.98 B: otherwise 

421.99 423.63 B: yeah i work with her yeah 

423.25 425.30 A: oh well good good 

424.50 426.14 B: yeah [noise] 

425.44 436.03 A: yeah we're still trying to get no into my little dog's vocabulary [laughter] but he's so cute he just turns his head and looks so i think i'm half the problem [laughter] i try you 

430.26 432.71 B: [laughter] 

435.69 440.90 B: yeah not to use no too much with him because i'm i'm afraid that you know people are always told no 

436.41 437.26 A: know 

440.48 441.53 A: uh-huh 

441.00 443.71 B: and so it won't be as effective i use um 

443.77 449.33 B: drop it a lot if she like grabs my shoe something she shouldn't have in her mouth i say drop it 

444.95 445.76 A: oh 

446.50 447.47 A: uh-huh 

448.90 449.92 A: oh 

449.99 451.05 A: yeah 

450.38 451.85 B: or um 

452.36 462.22 B: if she's sniffing something on the sidewalk or whatever i just say come you know i just yank her leash a little bit and say and say come i don't say no you know get away or whatever i just say come you know try to correct her on her on the leash 

455.12 456.12 A: uh-huh 

458.24 459.29 A: yeah 

461.84 467.32 A: mhm well i believe his is selective obedience because 

466.15 469.67 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

467.30 481.30 A: really yeah because he can understand doing tricks he's got it all down you know or he he even hears the word outside word to the point we have to spell it now or potty you know i mean 

473.37 474.67 B: (( [noise] right )) 

480.56 482.22 B: right oh yeah they know 

481.72 489.56 A: yeah he's doing something else he comes bounding from another room but boy when he's on a scent of something and he wants to do something 

489.72 499.03 A: he becomes stupid you know so that's what i call it selective obedience what he chooses to understand and comprehend so [laughter] 

491.80 492.67 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

498.28 503.92 B: that i mean she's she's at the age too i mean she's just a puppy she's not even like i said she's not even eight or ten weeks and um 

503.04 504.05 A: uh-huh 

504.02 511.83 A: yeah bentley's just over a year so [sigh] i think he has you know a little bit of puppy mentality left there so 

504.62 505.55 B: (( you know )) 

510.50 511.81 B: [laughter] 

511.79 519.36 A: or we're hitting the terrible twos i don't know which but [laughter] i wouldn't trade him for anything he's just a real sweetheart so 

519.39 523.64 B: yeah i love going out and walking her she's just so funny she cracks me up 

522.46 534.67 A: yeah well everything's a major investigation with him at that age you know a blade of grass is just more than they can deal with sometimes [laughter] with the excitement and whatnot but yeah 

526.67 527.73 B: right 

533.77 542.90 B: oh yeah i take her out in the back yard and that's what she does she like lays in the grass and like chews at it i i get her i i taught her how to fetch the ball so she's doing that really well 

536.94 539.63 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

542.47 543.56 A: uh-huh 

543.40 546.71 B: 'cause i i wanted to get her exercised [laughter] 

543.63 544.89 A: does she come 

545.72 559.32 A: does she bring it back that's the problem yeah oh well he'll he'll come with whatever little toy you know you toss ar- across the room oh he has no problem getting it it's coming back he'll come and go past you 

546.92 549.14 B: yeah she brings it back yes 

553.19 554.01 B: right 

559.22 566.56 A: and then go under yeah go in to the living room underneath the chair there and tease you you know that he got it so 

559.35 561.51 B: oh and take it away [laughter] 

566.07 567.06 B: right 

566.54 575.33 A: yeah he he's just quite the character there but yeah to have him come and just drop it in front of you again that hasn't happened yet but 

574.86 579.29 B: she doesn't drop it i mean she brings it back though and she flops down 

575.87 577.11 A: yeah 

577.26 585.25 A: yeah it's a good thing he doesn't have to earn his living you know [laughter] in obedience he wouldn't make it two two days so 

580.51 583.12 B: [laughter] 

584.74 586.49 B: [laughter] 

585.27 599.96 A: but he he's cute enough we'll just keep him on that basis but yeah he he's i can see he's going to be a the new student for the obedience because i worry you know if he gets off leash he better know to come for his own safety 

597.52 598.65 B: right
