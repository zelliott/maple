291.48 306.00 A: by hand um doesn't doesn't get it taken care of it's just right now here in northern california it's just really bad and like i said it doesn't matter what environment you live in they're just city or country they're just really bad

364.94 375.09 A: i was thinking about it i've been thinking about it 'cause they're so unusual that you know you you you buy goldfish as pets and you got to anticipate that they don't 

375.24 378.47 A: they're not the type of pet that lives for very long 

378.30 379.41 B: yeah 

378.76 386.66 A: but mine have lived forever and they just keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger and i got 'em when they were the not even no bigger than a dime

397.05 399.04 B: [laughter] 

397.91 402.37 A: i haven't even really named it the reason i named him flipper is because ah 

399.85 401.07 B: (( [laughter] )) 

402.31 413.92 A: ah whenever it come time to feeding he'd literally and i've never seen a goldfish do this before would flip up out of the tank and in the air and back into the water 'cause he knows it's feeding time 

412.13 413.88 B: i didn't know they could do that 

413.89 414.99 B: wow 

414.56 417.94 A: plus the ol- you know the old show flipper 

417.58 418.67 B: yeah

431.67 435.54 A: oh yeah i really enjoy my animals i'm a i'm a pet 

435.60 443.58 A: when when you when the call first came in and said the subject was pets i go oh this is something i could talk about [laughter] for sure [sigh] 

440.83 444.02 B: you know yeah yeah definitely 

443.72 444.97 A: yeah 

444.99 453.36 B: 'cause i don't have pets at home but we have you know family members that have pets and we you know when we did have pets it was just like 

450.08 451.18 A: uh-huh 

453.26 454.30 A: uh-huh 

453.31 466.84 B: yeah mostly dogs you know but occasionally there would be the fish there's been rabbits and it just [laughter] it's just you know they're very time consuming and if you you know if you want to be gone for any length of time 

458.93 459.81 A: uh-huh 

460.44 461.69 A: yeah 

466.90 474.60 B: um it's difficult you know when you have the pets because you've got to find either take 'em with you or find somebody to watch them
