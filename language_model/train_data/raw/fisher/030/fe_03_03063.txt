121.87 131.96 A: somebody watched him who watched him before and we really wanted him to come to our house just you know 'cause he's close by just to let him out a couple of times a day but 

128.86 129.68 B: right 

130.54 131.54 B: (( right mm )) 

132.14 134.59 A: he wanted to bring him to his house 

134.67 141.43 A: and spoil him and it's not a good idea because he still hasn't eaten since we got back and it's been almost a week 

141.19 142.41 B: (( ahah )) 

142.09 147.51 A: actually it's been more than a week we went we got back monday so yesterday was a week and he's just eating 

147.70 153.47 A: the stuff that we put on top of his dry he's like picking it out and he has not eaten yeah because he's so spoilt 

150.20 152.18 B: oh yeah 

153.02 156.48 B: 'cause what did he get at the other place did they give him crap and 

154.66 155.61 A: um 

155.64 158.67 A: [mn] at the table sandwiches at the table 

158.27 159.20 B: (( ach )) 

158.77 163.65 A: slept in in the kids' beds with them you know where he's not allowed to do that here 

161.25 162.14 B: oh 

163.18 164.36 B: right 

164.13 166.35 A: and it's just kinda like 

166.52 169.59 A: he eats and he will only eat when we have dinner 

169.29 170.14 B: right 

169.94 179.96 A: so it's like dinner time we put his bowl down and for the past over a week now he's just looking at it looking at us he'll eat the hotdog or whatever is on top of it maybe 

179.39 181.35 B: but he won't eat his regular food 

180.57 188.06 A: yeah and then i'll say you have to go eat your dinner buddy and he'd give me a dirty look and he goes downstairs to his his bed 

188.14 192.52 B: maybe you could um what we used to do for my dog is we would take 

192.53 194.08 B: either gravy 

194.41 200.95 B: and mix it in with the dry food so that he can't really well even then they sometimes will lick it off 

196.17 197.14 A: mhm 

199.84 202.99 A: that's what he's doing we tried barbeque sauce [laughter] 

202.42 205.15 B: ach [sigh] i know i've had i have 

203.41 205.43 A: we had bar- it's 

205.18 212.94 B: pet sitted before for people who have picky pets [laughter] one lady always had to put um parmesan cheese on her dog's 

212.38 214.48 A: oh really that's funny 

212.99 214.03 B: food 

214.19 228.24 B: and um but but and then these other people would put they'd just get a can of baby food turkey the ground turkey and and gravy or whatever and they'd mix that in with their food and the dog usually likes that 

219.95 221.04 A: mhm 

228.51 229.51 B: but 

229.27 240.33 A: well that's what we we've b- basically been doing mixing it in if if we're having you know if we're grilling he gets the hotdog otherwise he gets like a half a can of the wet and it was working out great and 

234.22 235.05 B: right 

237.88 238.83 B: right 

240.31 247.49 A: come to think of it when we got married last year he had him and the same thing happened so it looks like 

245.19 249.47 B: ach so it sounds like maybe you better not let that guy babysit any more 

247.75 253.70 A: well yeah i think that's gonna be the case but it's gonna i i don't know what we're gonna do 

251.10 252.14 B: oh 

252.67 256.33 B: well and it's not like he he likes the dog [laughter] you know 

255.88 261.75 A: he loves the dog but he's not listening to us it's kinda like when you watch someone's kid you really need to do what 

256.78 257.78 B: yeah 

258.07 259.07 B: right he's 

260.94 264.25 B: you have to follow in with the same procedure right 

262.15 267.81 A: their rules right because it turns them off dogs are just like little kids that way they're totally 

266.25 269.07 B: right they need their routine 

268.53 269.82 A: exactly 

269.65 270.63 B: um 

269.84 272.62 A: so he's just wild now it's crazy 

271.86 273.20 B: (( [laughter] uh-oh )) 

273.45 274.28 A: (( i )) 

273.59 276.94 B: well i went my friend amanda she left for um 

277.03 280.00 B: she and her husband were going away for their anniversary 

280.03 286.95 B: and she called me that morning and said oh my gosh my dog ran away she's like i don't know what to do because he 

283.98 285.17 A: oh no 

285.28 286.00 A: (( [laughter] )) 

287.00 291.98 B: he had an electric fence collar and we've had this trip planned forever and 

291.81 305.92 B: our reservations can't be cancelled and you know she went on and on and she said but i can't leave jack i can't leave knowing that jack may never come back or if he does that no one's going to be here so she asked me to go over and watch the house 

300.16 301.35 A: right 

306.29 310.26 B: so i stayed there for five days and jack never came back 

309.69 311.09 A: oh 

310.79 316.88 B: and um i called the s._p._c._a. i called just all over the place trying to get um 

317.60 329.49 B: any information to where jack could be and it turned out that um like three days after she got home she retraced all my steps she called the uh electric fence company and did everything 

319.61 320.58 A: oh 

329.66 336.46 B: and um the s._p._c._a. ended up calling her and telling her to look in the paper because there was an article and the description might 

336.89 343.17 B: match jack um 'cause i guess the s._p._c._a. runs free ads if you've found a pet 

337.83 338.91 A: mhm 

343.24 344.51 B: they they 

344.74 351.86 B: or the newspapers they will they'll let you say that you've found the pet so that yeah you don't have to pay for it or anything 

346.55 348.13 A: oh i didn't know that 

352.07 358.10 B: and then the s._p._c._a. checks those ads every day to see if there's any that match lost pets 

357.83 358.77 A: okay 

358.42 363.90 B: and so they called her and sure enough it was jack well it turned out he was found by 

364.35 375.20 B: a family that lives down the street he'd [laughter] crawled into their back yard and when she called her dogs in he ran straight into their living room and picked up one of the other dog's toys and started playing with it 

368.03 369.00 A: mhm 

374.47 376.44 A: so he didn't even get really far 

376.07 378.17 B: no he was only a block away 

376.66 377.83 A: that's funny 

377.90 378.70 A: (( mm )) 

378.37 383.45 B: but um the people ended up keeping him and taking care of him 

383.47 385.38 B: while they tried to find the owners 

384.82 386.02 A: mhm 

385.39 394.70 B: and they said if they they this was this article that they posted was the last ditch effort to find his owners and they were going to keep him otherwise um 

393.79 395.90 A: did he have he didn't have tags or 

396.23 398.56 B: no because he had an electric collar 

397.76 399.93 A: (( oh yeah )) 

398.63 401.47 B: the electric fence collar and it didn't have 

400.05 400.84 A: (( uh-huh )) 

401.75 404.62 B: any other information he has a chip in his head 

404.37 405.67 A: oh okay 

405.03 409.23 B: but um i guess they didn't take him in to to inspect that 

407.79 411.06 A: well how would they know i mean is it is it visible 

409.39 410.50 B: right 

410.86 412.08 B: no huh-uh 

411.30 412.84 A: to anybody else 

412.50 419.59 B: no the collar was but he i guess he just learned how to run through the fence yeah 

414.84 416.39 A: but got no tags 

418.62 419.84 A: oh gee 

419.80 421.40 B: so no name tags 

419.93 421.82 A: i didn't think they could get through 

422.22 435.11 B: they i guess they said that they thought maybe the batteries were running low on his collar so it didn't shock him but some dogs if there's enough incentive they'll just they know that they can get shocked and then they're done and they can run free 

426.53 427.88 A: mhm 

434.41 435.44 A: right 

435.37 437.78 B: so those fences don't always work 

437.61 438.33 A: mm 

438.40 442.46 B: but anyway [laughter] it turned out the people who found him were um 

443.15 448.25 B: they had worked for the s._p._c._a. during college they'd met each other there and 

448.38 449.33 B: um 

449.48 451.59 B: they you know so they had um 

451.64 455.56 B: they had always loved animals and they were really good to jack the whole time that 

456.07 459.29 A: he must have almost like he sensed it was a good place to go 

456.12 457.52 B: amanda was gone 

458.84 460.26 B: right [laughter] 

459.64 461.99 A: he might have been mad that they were going away 

462.14 463.27 B: maybe 

462.98 464.92 A: wanted to take his own little trip 

464.34 467.15 B: (( [laughter] right [laughter] he's like why can't i come )) 

466.59 475.03 A: [laughter] down the street or maybe he heard it from uh some of the other dogs came by and told him yeah this s._p._c._a. couple down the street [laughter] party at their house right 

470.89 471.78 B: (( right )) 

472.57 474.06 B: [laughter] that's right 

474.19 484.71 B: yeah there's better toys and better food well and they let him sleep in their bed with them like all three dogs piled into the bed and [laughter] this is just funny they they really liked him a lot so 

475.66 477.40 A: [laughter] there you go 

485.52 487.65 A: (( oh he had a nice little vacation too then ))

498.73 510.97 A: there's no way he could have gotten out unless somebody left the gate open but i was at work you know i was getting all upset and i i couldn't leave and um i so i called my fiance at the time and 

502.08 503.10 B: (( right mhm ))

515.01 515.95 B: oh 

515.70 523.38 A: she didn't even check the whole house [laughter] i mean i was glad he was here i was kinda mad at her but it was like everybody's out looking all over the neighborhood

559.99 562.08 A: right get them worried sure 

561.83 562.87 B: and um 

562.87 570.58 B: he showed up but for the life of me i can't figure out where he hid and i told his owners that when they got back and they said 

570.43 580.13 B: he hides he'll go in their closet and he'll sleep on this pile of blankets at the very top of their closet 'cause it has like one of those organizers so he can kinda jump up there 

573.12 574.11 A: mhm
