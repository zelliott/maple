55.90 56.88 A: oh 

59.48 61.74 A: mhm yeah yeah

69.51 72.21 B: ah well the big thing was our kids um 

72.46 80.75 B: [lipsmack] ah growing up getting married or getting their own places and each of them at one point took so many of the cats each 

76.39 77.67 A: mhm

86.38 89.18 A: yes it is a huge number yeah 

88.16 92.47 B: does does it just happen vicariously or do you just love to collect cats 

91.88 103.10 A: um ha a a little of both i mean we we definitely have too many it's it's more than we like but we're really just in love them and we're unwilling to give them [laughter] up too so

178.73 188.58 A: we had one cat and our neighbors had a couple of cats um all disappear right around the same time and we suspect it was dogs that were running around yeah 

183.69 184.64 B: (( mhm )) 

186.63 189.02 B: oh really wild dog packs huh 

188.51 200.14 A: yeah something like that and ah so what we actually did was i made a big outdoor area for them and so they're sort of contained even though they can go outside but ah 

189.78 190.34 B: (( [cough] ))

209.45 224.17 A: i have ah i i i do carpentry so ah um i ma- actually made some cat walks for them like up near the ceiling that they can walk around and what we did was take like a four by four pole and wrap it with sisal rope and they can 

215.03 215.96 B: mhm 

222.53 223.75 B: mhm right 

224.16 228.98 A: scoot up and down that yeah so

231.90 232.93 A: uh-huh 

234.70 243.60 B: and then i was um using one our couple of our bedrooms in our big old house to start on my next company which was a high tech data com company 

242.99 244.32 A: mhm 

243.82 247.83 B: and um my chief engineer worked in one of the rooms 

247.93 251.41 B: and um was violently allergic to fur 

251.17 253.22 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

251.79 252.86 B: um 

252.89 256.48 B: and he'd walk around ah with a surgical mask on 

256.07 257.17 A: uh-huh 

256.62 261.32 B: [lipsmack] and we had a um screen door actually ah put on to 

261.76 267.00 B: entrance to the room so that um you know he could both get air but keep the cats out 

267.03 268.66 A: right right 

267.27 272.96 B: and um ah one day he went to the bathroom and left the door slightly ajar 

272.47 274.18 A: uh-oh [laughter] 

273.28 278.74 B: and the cat went in climbed up on his work bench and peed right on his schematics and ah 

277.27 280.20 A: [laughter] 

279.19 282.36 B: as they say cats know i guess [laughter] 

280.64 290.70 A: [laughter] i guess so certainly in that case [laughter] oh my [laughter] 

285.53 286.48 B: yeah 

290.77 294.14 A: oh well that's a good story [laughter] 

293.76 296.89 B: so so how far are you from kemberton and those areas 

297.17 298.70 A: from from where

306.87 307.94 A: um 

307.70 311.01 B: okay i can't think of any nearby towns um mhm 

311.89 319.20 A: um if it's i think i know where you're talking about it's kind of a little bit north west of philadelphia 

318.51 320.56 B: oh that could be yeah 

320.36 322.02 A: yeah um 

321.05 321.87 B: okay 

322.24 325.35 A: don't know what else would be 'round there phoenixville or 

324.97 326.25 B: (( oh yeah )) 

325.87 329.18 A: ah valley forge that sort of area that way 

327.53 331.10 B: mhm right right like hershey and all those places 

330.92 336.63 A: right well hershey's out actually out further west um by a bit 

334.16 335.44 B: mhm 

335.87 336.76 B: (( okay )) 

337.15 342.62 A: but yeah an- and m- mostly i'm going between oxford and philadelphia itself so 

341.93 342.70 B: yeah 

344.42 347.31 B: so you only have the cats no dogs no other 

346.84 357.63 A: um ah no no other animals which the the cats are enough for now um i mean i had dogs growing up um and we had like one cat um 

351.49 352.68 B: yeah yeah 

356.27 357.80 B: mhm 

357.74 365.12 A: you know i certainly don't have anything against dogs but ah th- the cats are actually you know less maintenance as a whole it's um 

364.83 366.09 B: mhm 

365.15 372.35 A: you know y- y- you don't have to walk 'em and you know the- they'll come to you when they want to and [laughter] um 

372.18 375.49 B: that's true ah or when they want you otherwise they don't 

372.75 374.17 A: (( you know and )) 

374.65 377.37 A: right [laughter] yeah right right mm 

376.54 379.45 B: yeah i assume you have cat boxes around the house 

379.10 381.49 A: yes yes several [laughter] 

380.22 380.96 B: (( and )) 

381.80 383.61 A: yeah 

382.00 383.59 B: that's a pain in the neck 

383.82 386.10 A: yeah yeah and um 

385.94 400.18 A: and when we first brought them indoors um they were used to being out and they they kind of freaked out a little bit and and did start ah peeing in places where they shouldn't and they sort of got in that habit which is pretty unfortunate so tha- 

395.78 396.90 B: mhm 

398.99 400.62 B: yeah yeah 

400.29 403.03 A: that's that's something to deal with but ah 

403.63 413.18 A: but [sigh] you know it's ah we just m- and we do just really really enjoy 'em and ah you know really couldn't imagine just giving them up so um 

411.58 413.90 B: mhm mhm 

413.37 417.85 A: but we're determined not to collect any more [laughter] mm 

416.67 421.28 B: well our two youngest children each have um two maybe three cats 

420.80 422.02 A: mhm 

421.43 430.22 B: ah but my oldest daughter ah who's the takes takes totally after her mother in this regard i think has five or six plus two dogs 

429.82 432.10 A: okay that's a good collection 

430.72 435.11 B: and so she's um [lipsmack] totally animal rich as they say 

434.79 436.30 A: mhm mhm 

436.28 440.68 B: and she even had a cat ah that had diabetes or has diabetes 

440.30 441.56 A: oh okay 

440.89 446.99 B: and she comes home every day religiously from work ah to give it its insulin and um 

447.18 449.57 B: take care of it and ah you know 

449.74 456.08 B: maybe i'm bad guy but i would take the approach that that the poor thing must be in enough misery not to keep it 

456.29 460.53 B: going although it seems with her care to be happy and 

457.13 458.40 A: right 

460.00 470.56 A: right right yeah that's something that you have to think to kind of balance you know what's best for the cat and at what point is it suffering too much 

461.00 462.05 B: but still 

467.65 468.73 B: mhm 

470.08 472.50 B: yeah anyway 

470.61 472.25 A: yeah 

472.34 479.89 A: huh we ha- we have one cat that um has seizures um but ah it keeps under control with medication 

479.31 480.25 B: uh-huh 

480.13 493.56 A: so he's in good shape but he has to be pilled twice a day which um kind of is ha- difficult 'cause you know you can't really go away for a couple of days and where you normally could and yeah but 

490.37 491.92 B: mhm right yeah and that's a problem 

492.65 494.03 B: do you have any children 

494.04 495.78 A: no no we don't 

494.79 495.53 B: (( yeah )) 

495.55 496.80 B: mhm 

496.43 497.33 A: um 

497.48 499.36 A: and not really planning on it [mn] 

498.44 504.65 B: well you ah i don't know how old you are but remember the good old days when you'd go to a vet and a vet would charge you ten bucks 

504.86 510.12 B: or he might even put the cat or dog overnight and the cardiom might be twenty bucks 

510.35 514.44 B: 'cause now they charge what um people doctors charge 

514.67 516.62 A: right right 

514.94 516.46 B: and um [lipsmack] 

516.74 523.12 B: so you can't really do anything and now of course ah th- the care that you can get from these people includes 

523.15 528.04 B: regular teeth cleaning um and other treatments and um 

524.81 526.56 A: mhm mhm 

528.53 532.02 B: you know it's quite extraordinary i've been to venice 

530.62 531.53 A: right 

532.12 536.34 B: [lipsmack] and other places around the world where cats wander free 

536.57 542.10 B: and um the last thing people would do is invest a nickel in them um 

540.56 541.61 A: (( right mm )) 

543.17 548.70 B: [cough] and um you know there's no such thing as a small animal [cough] 

549.32 552.16 B: excuse me vet or doctor unless of course 

552.25 555.21 B: you're wealthy and um americanized 

555.12 564.56 A: right right well heck they even have pet psychiatrists nowadays [laughter] so [laughter] i've heard of such things i've never i've never actually met one but ah 

558.98 560.04 B: oh really 

563.55 568.30 B: yeah i don't know if you've heard of this um comedian stan holloway or 

568.48 571.40 B: whatever he did a recording once of 

571.51 574.11 B: this very snooty woman who um 

574.30 576.32 B: had a cat um 

576.41 584.71 B: that was her pet and it was you know primped and carried in her arm all the time it had perfume and ribbons and gold 

584.40 585.36 A: mhm 

584.77 590.36 B: jewelry and um you know it was absolutely so pampered pampered that ah 

588.70 589.73 A: mhm 

590.45 599.89 B: it was obscene and it was being particularly cranky and um you know um crotchety [mn] so that the woman brought it to this
