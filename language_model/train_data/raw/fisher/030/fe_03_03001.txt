75.78 76.91 B: yeah 

76.31 84.31 A: yeah we spent a a bunch of money and he had an operation and ah he was about six at that time so he went on to have another ten years but 

83.77 84.87 B: wow 

84.38 92.60 A: um you know we were really fortunate cause i guess we got him as a gift some a friend of a friend brought him over and ah 

92.12 92.82 B: (( okay )) 

92.50 104.16 A: he just thought he'd be a good fit for the family and he just he was um not a very big dog which was kind of perfect for the family here and he had a real good disposition he 

100.87 101.63 B: (( mm )) 

104.00 108.83 A: he got along with strangers ah he did his job if someone came to the door he barked 

108.68 110.37 B: mhm 

108.70 115.56 A: um but other than that he was very friendly and he got along with people and other animals and um 

115.35 125.64 A: the only problem i think we had was i mean we put up with it but my father was not big on shedding and oh boy when he shed he shed [laughter] so um 

121.55 122.80 B: mhm 

124.51 127.46 B: yeah did he have like long fur short fur 

127.33 133.49 A: um no it was i i don't know h- how to describe it maybe like a a medium type but um 

132.06 133.35 B: okay okay 

133.38 142.40 A: yeah come spring he definitely left his mark wherever he would lay down and oh boy lot of vacuuming and ah lot of brushing but ah 

136.64 137.78 B: [laughter] 

142.39 149.79 A: ah you know you get so used to him and yo- you just ah yeah so it was it was a good experience um 

145.66 146.60 B: yeah 

149.78 163.60 A: ah you know i don't think i'd have another one only cause i'm so active and like you it just isn't practical because i'm like not home much and um you know you want to put some time into it you know you don't just want to get a pet for the pet's sake you know 

155.31 156.42 B: yeah 

157.66 158.99 B: (( yeah exactly )) 

161.06 161.89 B: (( mm )) 

163.05 164.44 B: (( yeah yeah have )) 

163.96 166.42 A: you want to treat it as part of the family so 

165.89 168.99 B: you ever thought about got- getting a a cat 

168.46 183.39 A: you know what um i'm not a big fan of cats and i i guess that's a a general statement cause of the cats i've met in my life i guess there are some really um affectionate cats but they just seem to me very standoffish and 

171.70 172.90 B: (( yeah )) 

175.86 176.81 B: okay 

181.65 184.28 B: (( aloof standoffish yeah )) 

183.61 186.00 A: yeah they just don't they don't 

186.16 188.97 A: seem to capture me i i you know a dog 

189.28 194.29 A: ah my dog even if like you stepped on him he'd come to apologize to you i mean they 

193.73 195.29 B: (( for being in the way )) 

194.52 207.06 A: yeah for being in the way you know and a cat would just they just look like they have an attitude [laughter] problem at least like i said the one's i've i've been in contact with but yeah so no that's that's not my idea of a pet 

195.57 196.61 B: [laughter] oh 

200.21 201.48 B: (( yeah )) 

202.43 204.30 B: mhm 

206.90 207.83 B: okay 

207.41 209.18 A: yeah um but 

208.47 210.18 B: (( i didn't yeah )) 

209.54 219.89 A: we did have also we had a bird at one time but ah yeah ah we couldn't let him out of the cage he wasn't the type the kind of t- i- if he saw an open window he would have been gone so 

212.63 213.57 B: oh 

219.40 220.99 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

219.96 220.96 A: um 

221.18 226.93 A: but anyway so how about have you been exposed to other animals other than the ones you had 

226.01 237.13 B: um my brother had a cat for a while and um i got it to be personally i thought it it was just completely it was so adorable but i think the thing about cats is just um 

234.89 235.67 A: (( mm )) 

238.03 242.70 B: they it's a lot harder to kind of earn their respect and their trust 

241.63 242.93 A: mhm okay 

242.47 254.36 B: ah and so like you really have to spend a lot of time with them before they'll feel comfortable with you ah like petting them or something like that and they're never really affectionate i think just cause they're really independent animals 

247.58 248.45 A: mhm 

254.01 255.23 A: right right 

254.49 260.42 B: but i don't know i kind of i kind of respect that about them [laughter] it's it's interesting it's kind of ah 

257.55 258.52 A: (( aha )) 

261.17 262.46 B: yeah 

261.62 270.66 A: they they do seem incredibly intelligent they just look like they have everything under control um you know where you know a dog ah 

264.86 265.78 B: mhm 

267.05 268.31 B: (( yes [mn] )) 

270.48 284.00 A: can be pretty stupid at times i mean they have good instincts but i mean on the whole i mean a cat is no comparison i- in my opinion but um yeah they do seem quite independent and quite under control and just 

277.13 280.53 B: (( yeah hm )) 

281.51 282.78 B: (( mhm )) 

283.87 293.16 A: they seem very smart to me but um yeah i i i don't know i don't i guess my that's not my opinion of a pet though i just want 

285.84 287.77 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

293.13 302.04 A: i want to be laying down and have my ah pet come to sit next to me and ah you know just say hey i'm here i'm i'm your companion [laughter] 

296.55 299.39 B: (( mm precisely and that's true )) 

301.18 315.72 B: i think like um you know in the animal like um you can always devote the relationship with it and it could be completely contrary to o- other people's um experiences and will ah people might say like um i have a friend who has a chinchilla 

312.64 313.44 A: right 

315.45 316.79 A: (( okay mhm )) 

316.21 317.40 B: and um 

317.43 318.66 B: like 

318.74 329.69 B: and when she first got it like sh- what she heard was that chinchillas are very territorial and um they're very difficult to make pets that basically you you keep them cause they look nice and stuff like that but um 

329.76 337.10 B: it's been a it's been about two years now and then like the chinchilla is just like the most adorable thing in the world it would like 

336.86 349.99 B: um my friend would be typing her essay and ah the chinchilla would like just like walk up to her and like sit on top of her keyboard and be like you know just like roll over and like you know scratch my stomach you know scratch my stomach i'm not gonna let you do your homework if i 

347.18 347.98 A: (( mhm really [laughter] )) 

349.89 357.07 B: ah [laughter] yeah um it was just completely unheard of for like you know a chinchilla they're tree rats for crying out loud but um 

350.51 351.46 A: wow 

352.10 353.04 A: yeah 

356.30 357.44 A: (( mhm wow )) 

357.15 358.42 B: (( yeah )) 

357.81 363.90 A: yeah i guess you're right i guess it i guess it depends on the animal and it also depends on the owner and the the relationship 

361.04 365.18 B: yeah yeah and the relationship that they've both got 

364.67 369.99 A: yeah well i do have a friend that has one dog and three cats and ah 

368.44 370.64 B: (( hm )) 

369.77 375.83 A: he says that ah i mean his cat he'll swear is the most intelligent animal he's ah ever seen which i 

374.26 375.51 B: (( hm )) 

375.60 384.67 A: i don't know it seems probably a little biased coming from him but i mean every night he says when he goes to bed the cat comes in the bed and just perches like 

378.82 379.98 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

384.43 390.13 A: right alongside his arm and stays there the whole night it's like his spot and and um 

387.62 388.59 B: (( oh )) 

389.95 403.45 A: you know he heard when he's not at home that cat will cry all night and i mean they've developed they've bonded and and i i find that surprising for a cat i mean it could be more typical than i know but um i was really surprised to hear that and ah 

393.80 394.82 B: oh 

400.62 401.36 B: (( mm )) 

403.16 403.87 B: (( mm )) 

403.41 406.41 A: the dog is a little bit high strung um 

406.31 420.96 A: it it could be partially because of the owner as well they said they did kind of ah take up with the owner as like um the cat is ah the dog's a little high strung but he's also um just i don't know just a really affectionate animal and 

409.76 410.66 B: (( yeah )) 

412.54 414.41 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

420.38 422.49 B: yeah in general they are 

421.04 421.88 A: um 

422.32 433.70 A: you know i but you do have to be lucky 'cause i i i grew up ah with a friend of mine down the block who had a schnauzer and um for whatever reason and my friend was just a very 

433.79 445.84 A: friendly kind person from what i can telly this dog was just oh you got within three feet of him and he wanted to bite you and he wouldn't st- stop barking until you left the vicinity and 

436.69 437.51 B: (( mhm is he )) 

442.21 444.03 B: (( mhm )) 

445.60 447.23 B: mhm 

445.94 457.58 A: i was thinking to myself gee th- you know you you wanna pet and you get something like that i mean i hope when he was in the comfort of their home alone you know he was you know a better pet for them but 

451.51 452.89 B: it's not worth it 

456.91 458.18 B: yeah 

457.51 469.49 A: i he just seemed liked the nastiest pet i mean i don't know his background you know i don't know if he was abused or something before they got him but you know that was ah that wasn't my idea of a pet you know but 

461.05 462.99 B: yeah 

464.11 466.24 B: yeah yeah 

468.82 470.76 B: yeah 

469.83 471.99 A: yeah i guess you know i guess mhm 

471.24 486.20 B: that could be very well be at the like um i don't know i just think 'cause one of my friends before he's he's got a pet dog um and when i was really small ah the dog was really really friendly to everybody but um at one point [laughter] 

486.07 500.19 B: he invited these um a couple of other kids to his place and you know how children can be really cruel like and the children were [mn] really really cruel to his dog um while my friend went out to buy dinner or something like that um 

491.41 492.58 A: yes mhm 

500.22 504.78 B: and as a result of this trauma like the dog has never been the same the 

503.86 505.45 A: oh my goodness mhm 

504.70 509.80 B: dog only trusts it's fa- like it's family but to everybody else if you 

509.71 520.51 B: come so close it's like no yeah basically if you if you even like just approach it or try to pet it it'll like it- it's bitten people and it's hurt people before yeah and it's 

519.06 521.31 A: wow that's sad yeah 

520.51 525.93 B: it's completely completely changed it's disposition like hundred eighty degrees yeah 

523.81 531.51 A: oh oh boy that they're it's that's sad it's it's amazing how one experience could shape the dog like that but 

530.73 532.18 B: mhm yeah 

531.66 537.67 A: again i guess it depends on the dog um something i did learn about dogs ah a friend of mine um 

537.63 549.65 A: he took a pit bull in it was um he found it at a gas station and they were kinda feeding it for a while but it was a stray and they were just kinda having mercy on it so he took it in and um 

545.78 546.88 B: (( mm [mn] )) 

549.73 562.70 A: i mean the only side effect of it being a stray and i guess having a rough life on the street was that it it just is very very scared to be alone now so it just kinda follows my friend from room to room and you know but 

558.51 559.29 B: (( mm )) 

560.24 561.10 B: oh 

561.52 562.74 B: [laughter] 

562.49 568.75 A: but he was never trained as people understand ah pit bulls pit bulls are not um 

568.60 573.96 A: are not vicious are not they don't attack other dogs ah without training he 

570.52 571.51 B: yeah 

572.20 572.99 B: (( mm )) 

573.44 574.34 B: yeah 

573.77 576.72 A: he's the most loving dog i mean 

576.50 590.75 A: you know unfortunately in the back of my head i have you know god forbid he he loses it for thirty seconds ah i can be history but u- unfortunately that's in the back of my head but i mean on the surface this is the most loving dog i have probably ever seen in my life and 

584.03 584.90 B: [laughter] 

590.17 591.11 B: wow 

590.68 599.89 A: it it just you know that stereotype that they're mean or you know they're attack dogs is untrue um from what he told me he did some reading on them 

595.16 597.07 B: yeah 

597.20 597.97 B: (( mm ))
