0.17 2.16 A: [noise] hi 

0.27 1.44 B: (( hello )) 

2.45 4.01 B: hi i'm stacey 

3.98 9.59 A: hi stacey this is sydney at the building education centre in berkeley california 

8.98 11.70 B: okay well i'm in panama city florida 

11.84 14.57 A: great how are you doing today 

14.58 19.53 B: i'm doing good um can can you hear me okay 'cause i'm on my cell phone 

15.86 16.72 A: have you 

17.82 18.46 A: (( yeah )) 

18.96 20.80 A: yes i can hear you fine 

20.68 24.35 B: okay well if it if it goes out or comes in and out just let me know 

24.36 29.75 A: [noise] okay ah for now it seems fine have you participated on these calls before 

29.75 33.82 B: ah no i got a call um a week or so ago 

33.99 41.05 B: and i forgot and i didn't know what it was so every time they would call i just thought it was advertisement and i kept hanging up [laughter] 

40.40 42.40 A: [laughter] oh really 

41.35 49.76 B: and then i then i remembered what it was 'cause i did the thing online through shopping probably a month ago 

49.48 51.10 A: mhm 

50.38 56.55 B: so i had just really forgotten about it so i said well if i get it again i'm going to talk this time 

52.62 53.72 A: well i've 

55.90 62.79 A: right i hung up i did one on it said what is the worse vice you know it was vices and sins 

62.63 77.19 A: and then the second one they called about was reality t._v. and i hung up 'cause i really didn't want to talk about reality t._v. but today i i i have a dog and i have fish and i love my pets so that's a good topic for me 

70.13 71.31 B: yeah 

76.66 90.06 B: what right and it was for me and mine that i called um said something about ah a topic of nine one one and i just like i said i didn't even remember what it was and when i hung up then it dawned on me and then by then they never they didn't call me back so 

89.29 90.64 A: mhm 

89.95 95.79 B: but yes i'm i'm a big pet person i have um three um calico cats 

95.94 101.87 B: and um and a an aquarium with fish and my two daughters have a couple hamsters 

102.23 103.43 B: so um 

103.55 109.50 B: i mean they're definitely part of the family they're just more more of the children i guess [laughter] 

108.69 113.51 A: [noise] i think that's true that they really do make a family ah 

113.79 117.86 A: more complete especially when you have the little kids [noise] 

117.35 120.94 B: oh yeah and i think it's important that um 

121.05 128.89 B: you know like my daughter's that i have a seven and a nine year old and you know i've expressed to them well you know the hamsters only live a couple of years and uh 

129.09 137.27 B: 'cause they've never really experienced like death or anything and i think it's one way to train or teach children 

132.86 134.15 A: (( right [noise] )) 

137.36 143.73 B: you know about death that it kinda helps i guess helps a little bit to prepare if a family member 

143.85 145.42 B: happens to die 

145.57 148.59 B: or a cat or dog that's kind of 

148.70 157.39 B: probably more loved than maybe just like something like a hamster but it kinda teaches them about you know death and things like that so i think that that's 

157.42 159.96 B: my opinion i think that kinda helps them a little bit 

159.62 164.61 A: well i guess if a hamster lasts a couple of years that's a pretty long life [noise] 

164.53 170.84 B: yeah well that's what i heard when we got 'em we haven't had 'em quite a year but when we let 'em know when we got them that 

170.77 180.52 B: okay these are your responsibility and then one day you know they are not going to live forever not going to be around as long as a cat or a dog will you know ten or fifteen years they're not going to be here that long [laughter] 

180.06 181.47 A: mhm 

181.57 185.21 B: so and you have what what did you say you have a dog 

184.38 189.00 A: i well i have an aquarium with about a dozen fish that ah 

188.91 197.68 A: i it's funny how attached i get to the different fish and the personality and there's i have a frog in there and an eel but my dog 

196.74 198.08 B: oh really 

197.59 212.25 A: oh yeah but my dog is my baby he's ah [sigh] he's a almost two and a half year old rottweiler he's huge and i got him when he was two years old he was raised by his mother and his father 

198.90 199.80 B: (( oh )) 

212.38 219.71 A: and he was the only child and he's got his tail and his ears and he's just the biggest baby on earth [lipsmack] 

219.48 222.34 B: yeah and i think it also you know people 

222.35 228.82 B: have such a bad opinion of those dogs but i think it depends on the owner the animals pick up their owner's personality 

228.78 229.90 A: i think 

229.10 233.80 B: and every animal has such a different i mean personality they're 

233.99 236.49 B: they're just like little people [laughter] 

235.32 239.96 A: mhm i think for the most part that's true i suppose there's some dogs that maybe 

239.94 241.08 A: that 

240.92 245.02 A: regardless of the breed are just you know meaner than others but 

244.84 256.93 A: i think it really does always boils down to the the care givers and the training and whatnot that they get i wi- i really wish i could have a cat but i'm a little nervous because 

252.16 253.20 B: right 

256.83 267.21 A: i just don't know him being so big and his paws being so big i know he'd just wanna play but you know i i i'm a little ah hesitant to do that 

262.61 263.69 B: mhm 

267.15 272.14 B: yeah well he may not he may be jealous on one end but then 

272.15 279.49 B: he may just look at it as a toy for him [laughter] oh i can play with this this is fun [laughter] 

275.13 276.14 A: mhm 

278.15 280.45 A: mhm 

279.69 283.01 B: but yeah we're we're looking to um get 

283.12 287.50 B: a dog actually we're in the process of building a home so 

287.72 292.73 B: in a couple months' time when the home is finished and we have a big back yard we're looking at getting

512.04 515.65 B: i don't know why i'm just not i guess because you can't really 

515.66 521.00 B: pick 'em up and love 'em like you can a dog and a cat i mean i guess you could if it was a larger bird 

520.76 521.85 A: mhm 

521.16 526.39 B: but they just seem to be more delicate i have had birds in the past and i just

528.64 529.61 B: you know 

529.71 530.29 B: (( [mn] )) 

530.43 532.85 B: cat or dog type person 

532.57 536.60 A: they do seem more fussy and hard to take care of that's for sure it 

536.17 543.01 B: yeah and i the one we had the food was all over the floor and even though we would put something around the bottom of the cage 

542.39 543.75 A: was always a mess 

543.62 556.24 B: it would just throw stuff out of the cage a cockatiel a couple cocka- cockatiels and they just threw stuff out all the time and so but no we'll get get don't wanna get back into the bird thing [laughter] 

555.55 557.16 A: well berkeley 

556.34 569.08 B: i'd rather actually rather though what i do is i do put out a a bird house and a bird feeder and and that type thing in the back yard so i love to watch 'em outside and i'm definitely an animal person with 

564.72 565.28 A: (( [noise] )) 

569.14 574.47 B: watching on the squirrels seem to eat the bird food but that's okay 'cause i like them too but 

574.09 575.45 A: [laughter] 

574.87 584.61 B: [laughter] but don't want any of those in the house birds would not fit in with the cat [laughter] they would end up in as a meal i think 

579.25 581.22 A: [noise] right 

585.12 599.89 A: well it seems like everybody in berkeley has a dog and they have parks that are dedicated to dogs and we have a lot of nice shoreline parks too which is really good for the kids to get out and you know take the dogs to 

585.30 586.07 B: but
