276.15 284.15 B: well ah we basically like i say i i'm here all the time so they're literally here all the time too so 

280.86 282.08 A: yeah

290.85 292.59 B: mhm

298.52 300.56 A: we have to brush him down 

299.24 301.16 B: one of 'em 

301.20 314.99 B: yeah understand that [laughter] that's one thing about lizards the only thing i'll have to worry about there is feeding them crickets and and ah cleaning up after them like a little cat with a [laughter] yeah with a little scooper out of the sand you know 

303.26 304.01 A: yeah 

307.54 308.59 A: yeah 

311.94 313.40 A: (( oh yeah )) 

314.60 319.03 A: ah we've had crickets the last couple of summers really bad 

318.41 321.79 B: ah different kind of crickets this is the one like you use for fish bait 

321.57 323.13 A: (( oh oh )) 

321.95 323.38 B: li- little brown 

324.10 325.63 A: (( okay )) 

325.18 329.93 B: yeah and i got to got to feed the darn things and and everything else 

329.97 333.99 A: what about your cats do you have a certain cat food that you 

333.36 345.80 B: [sigh] ah we basically we use meow mix for dry stuff and then we use ah ah canned stuff we feed them every other day for their coats and have you know fish and that kind of stuff in it 

344.86 352.55 A: mhm i started mine out on a dry dog food and i've stayed with that because i can buy it in the big twenty five fifty pound sacks 

352.31 358.58 B: yeah w- when i a a kid we had a do- we had dogs eh i l- i was raised on a farm 

353.34 354.54 A: and so 

358.31 359.43 A: oh okay 

358.74 363.23 B: and we um we always fed 'em the dry stuff you know 'cause 

362.62 363.91 A: yeah 

363.28 370.75 B: you know usually with dogs especially they don't seem to you know they seem to do just as good or better than they on that stuff than the other anyway 

364.48 365.81 A: easier to keep 

368.44 370.29 A: oh yeah yeah 

370.56 380.80 A: well he does get a treat every once in a while that he'll do some tricks for i've i've taught him how to roll over and sit and shake and you know all those kind of things and 

373.90 375.22 B: (( hm )) 

377.79 378.69 B: yeah 

380.15 388.71 B: you know the the thing a a lot of people have to have in their you know un- unfortunately what they don't do with their dogs is just train them how to behave mm 

388.01 397.78 A: [laughter] oh yeah yeah well ah he started out being a people dog because ever since he was a puppy he's been around people and he loves kids 

397.85 408.92 A: and the thing that concerns me is he if he ever got out he'd follow anybody anywhere and ah he loves to get in the car and so if someone just drove up opened their car door he'd jump in 

402.52 403.72 B: yeah 

408.62 409.89 B: mhm 

409.37 423.33 A: and ah one i do let him out to go to the mail box ah to get the mail and ah one day he just went across the street went right in to the neighbor's ah house 'cause she had the door open just walked right on in 

422.89 424.12 B: yeah 

423.77 435.34 A: so ah he he he's very friendly and ah i'd had him in the car one day when i was taking my wife somewhere and we got out and there's some people standing there and one of the ladies asked me does he bite 

425.13 425.70 B: (( [mn] )) 

426.66 427.86 B: yeah 

435.34 439.68 A: because people the first thing they think of is a dog may react 

435.67 438.25 B: [laughter] 

439.72 442.10 A: to you and maybe try to bite you 

441.76 442.91 B: yeah 

442.31 447.25 A: ah i don't think he knows what that is you know he's he's so friendly 

445.76 448.42 B: and the only way he's going to bite is if you mistreat him 

448.15 453.47 A: yes and he's never been mistreated um that i know of 

451.53 456.74 B: yeah i don't know you know i- i've n- i've never unde- been able to understand these people that can 

456.78 461.74 B: mistreat their pets it's i put that in the same class as mistreating your kids 

457.79 459.59 A: oh yeah 

461.08 469.03 A: oh yes yes that's a terrible terrible thing to do because a dog doesn't know any better you know she's 

468.30 475.62 B: a dog is one of the most loyal pets you'll ever have you know 'cause you could mistreat the heck out of him and he still wants you to love him 

470.70 473.32 A: oh yes yes 

474.77 477.88 A: oh yeah ah i think people 

476.64 482.31 B: cats are a little more different you know they you mistreat a cat and ah eventually they'll move on 

482.08 483.11 A: yes 

483.25 495.62 B: you know but a dog he'll you know you can beat him and kick him and everything else and he'll still sit there and want you to pet him and it's it's a it's a shame there's so darn many people that have dogs 

483.26 484.27 A: yeah i 

484.94 485.72 A: yeah 

488.55 490.98 A: yes yes he will 

494.85 497.35 A: oh yeah makes me sick 

496.79 500.65 B: yeah like i say i- i- it's in the same class as beating your kids 

500.41 506.10 A: [lipsmack] but ah i tell you what we we love our dog and we spend time with him and 

500.80 501.82 B: (( ah )) 

505.50 507.56 B: (( yeah don't )) 

506.16 520.09 A: and ah he's a real joy and he's a real companion and a real comfort to have around and when you you feel down he he makes you feel better and he always brings a smile to your face and ah 

512.38 513.33 B: yeah 

518.03 526.56 B: yeah at the end of the day sometimes when you don't understand what's going on at work you come home and at least you know somebody cares [laughter] 

522.85 523.82 A: yeah 

524.65 535.65 A: oh yeah yeah i- in fact people have said you know if if people would like would like me unconditionally like my dog was i'd get along more often ha you know 

535.13 540.46 B: yeah un- unfortunately th- there's too darn many people out there that are just plain 

535.80 537.77 A: because they just accept you 

540.24 541.68 A: yeah 

541.28 542.95 B: (( ah i don't know they're )) 

542.21 544.22 A: yeah 

543.32 550.59 B: they're just not a gr- you know they don't they they make no effort to get along with anybody and i've never been able to understand why you know 'cause 

547.63 548.51 A: well th- 

549.38 554.40 A: yeah i hadn't either th- this is our fourth generation of sheltie 

554.10 555.30 B: yeah 

554.30 569.06 A: ah and i've i when we lost our last one ah my son and my wife and i all stood over him when the vet took him and just cried and you know had a hard time letting him go 

569.18 574.39 A: and i said but the best thing we can do is just go out and get an- get a puppy 

569.25 571.30 B: oh yeah but 

573.96 575.13 B: yeah 

574.48 582.53 A: and a lot of people won't do that but we just felt like that was the best thing and when we did we've been happy about it ever since 

578.04 580.71 B: yeah well you know it's 

581.70 593.42 B: yeah well it's you know it's ah it's something you don't want to do with them too you know it's you know like if they ge- if they're really sick you know th- you know i- it's you know you don't want them to suffer 

592.82 594.74 A: right right 

593.44 595.95 B: or at least i you know i don't you know 

595.20 596.70 A: i i don't either 

596.09 599.89 B: i'd you know i i hate seeing an animal suffer like i say you know 

599.03 599.89 A: oh sure
