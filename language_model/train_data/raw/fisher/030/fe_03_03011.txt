218.17 218.82 B: uh-huh 

218.57 223.02 A: ah in fact my cocker she paid her way here 'cause she went through three litters 

223.17 224.19 B: oh 

223.83 225.11 A: (( so she kind of )) 

225.30 227.23 A: paid her own room and board 

226.62 227.65 B: uh-huh 

227.77 233.12 B: great but you say this ah cockatiel is every bit as 

228.54 229.77 A: but um 

233.17 235.61 B: warm and friendly as a dog mm 

235.60 238.00 A: well at first they're not because they're 

238.47 246.61 A: what i want to say that that they're nervous type that they're just unsure of the surroundings and the people they take a little longer to warm up to you 

246.78 248.00 B: okay 

247.42 254.17 A: but now i can o- i open the cage and he just hops right up at the door and i put my hand out he'll hop up on my hand and 

254.41 264.68 A: he's he's ah getting much better now and it just takes time you know and i walk ar- i don't walk around but i roll around with him and like i say he sits on my shoulder and does different things 

265.62 266.55 B: yeah 

265.65 268.88 A: you know e- even gotten him so he starts to play a little bit too 

268.61 269.59 B: (( uh-huh )) 

269.22 273.50 A: where he'll he'll make like he's biting you but he's not and he's just kind of playing 

273.20 275.22 B: yeah 

274.42 277.96 A: and in the beginning you couldn't pet him at all you i can now 

278.76 279.87 B: (( oh wow )) 

278.93 283.41 A: so it's just it's just like i say getting used to his surroundings i think it what it was 

283.21 285.42 B: right 

285.83 286.89 B: (( uh-huh )) 

285.88 288.04 A: but he's he's pretty good 

288.22 290.31 B: yeah 

290.08 292.97 A: he's just sitting up on the perch watching right now [laughter] 

293.81 294.66 B: (( [mn] oh )) 

294.98 300.00 A: he- he's really funny 'cause he- he's all white with these two orange spots on his ah up around his beak 

300.51 303.89 B: okay i haven't seen that before 

301.55 302.52 A: yeah 

303.21 308.79 A: no it's it's it's really a very unique i've only seen one other and that was at the same pet store where we got this one 

309.36 312.63 A: um most of them are are gray in color 

313.00 314.05 B: uh-huh 

313.64 319.27 A: and this one just seems to be different and since he's different in his looks he's different in his personality 

319.89 320.74 B: huh 

320.88 324.79 B: so do you have a method to teaching him how to speak 

324.52 329.33 A: um the only method you really can use is just to to sit with him and just keep repeating things 

329.06 330.82 B: mhm 

329.95 337.00 A: you know like ah like i say he learned the wolf call to whistle first and then he picked up the phone 'cause he's close to the phone he hears that 

337.20 340.74 A: but i've gotten him to do other whistles and it's just by repeating the whistle 

341.18 343.52 A: and eventually he he picks it up 

343.49 344.56 B: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

344.21 345.69 A: it's just repetition 

345.88 346.98 B: yeah you 

346.27 348.29 A: like a lot of people learn [mn] 

349.13 351.99 B: you do a lot of ah wolf calls right 

351.36 357.93 A: ah no i don't [laughter] that that was the strange one that's why it was kind of funny that that's the first one he picked up [mn] 

352.28 354.62 B: [laughter] yeah well [mn] 

357.16 359.95 B: yeah huh 

360.66 362.53 B: interesting 

362.03 364.24 A: (( yeah it is i- ah like i say he's )) 

364.25 367.72 A: he's shown me a couple of different things i will say that you know but ah 

368.51 373.81 A: i i'd never really thought of a bird until ah i had my my problem here and then i thought well this 

373.99 377.99 A: he's here you can talk to him and you can tell when he's listening to you 

378.44 379.38 B: uh-huh 

378.46 381.93 A: because he'll cock his head so you know he's he's listening 

382.33 384.36 A: how much he understands who knows 

385.27 390.08 B: yeah do you have other family members who have ah any pets 

389.86 392.60 A: but ah my daughter has two two dogs 

392.84 394.52 A: they're driving her nuts 

393.05 393.67 B: [mn] 

394.55 397.57 B: oh dear but she keeps them 

394.65 395.80 A: [laughter] 

397.68 401.31 A: well she yeah they're both young that's why they're driving her nuts 

401.63 406.21 A: ah her and her husband are constantly you know with the take 'em out take 'em out take care of them this way and 

406.23 410.97 A: one is ah very hyperactive and the other is just normal active so they 

411.04 412.91 A: they really keep 'em going 

413.04 414.49 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

415.05 416.50 A: constantly moving 

416.12 420.91 B: yeah if i were to get a dog i i would be very um 

421.34 424.07 B: um what picky 

424.27 436.20 B: you know in what i i want as far as you know temperament and have to be a very smart dog you know and quiet and yeah 

426.22 427.20 A: mhm 

431.69 432.59 A: sure 

435.17 437.56 A: quiet there's not a lot of quiet dogs 

437.29 438.37 B: oh no 

437.92 440.09 A: no not until they get older [laughter] 

439.48 440.47 B: oh 

440.14 441.63 A: [laughter] 

441.66 443.95 B: i don't know like a german shepherd 

444.11 446.87 A: see now the one hers is a german shepherd 

447.26 448.73 B: and he's noisy 

448.12 453.42 A: he's not real noisy but he does make noise but maybe that comes from the fact that the other dog 

453.46 457.10 A: is there to play with and to you know talk to and and do things with 

457.43 459.17 A: (( that might be part of the re- you know ah )) 

459.32 463.38 A: he doesn't um well he's still young but he doesn't um 

463.63 466.27 A: initiate a lot of barking but he does bark 

465.79 467.94 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

467.68 472.17 A: i would say out of out of all the dogs i've had that the cocker was probably the quietest 

473.36 476.47 A: um 'cause after you get past the the puppy stage 

476.49 479.06 A: the cocker really calms down and ah 

479.39 481.57 A: really does become a family dog 

481.73 483.17 B: (( hm )) 

483.23 485.54 B: yeah they are pretty sedate 

484.81 486.85 A: mhm mhm 

486.20 489.81 B: yeah but they leave too much hair 

489.67 491.52 A: ah that can happen yes 

490.99 494.96 B: yeah that's right another qualification i need is ah 

495.29 496.41 B: you know they 

496.48 498.29 B: i don't want a shedder 

497.75 500.59 A: it well they all shed a little remember that 

500.01 503.35 B: yeah some but some a lot more than others 

500.63 501.95 A: [laughter] 

502.77 503.83 A: oh yes 

503.94 505.77 B: yeah 

504.20 512.00 A: yeah yeah i ah the the noisiest dog i've ever had was was my airedale but um she basically was a watch dog 

511.94 513.13 B: okay 

512.41 516.73 A: (( but you kind of wanted her to do that but airedales were um )) 

517.02 520.11 A: originally bred as hunting dogs um 

520.84 522.47 B: yeah 

521.67 525.81 A: (( can't remember where they exactly i think they were from scotland originally )) 

523.69 525.09 B: yeah 

525.38 526.40 B: huh 

526.75 531.58 A: and ah that's what they were bred to do there there was kind of like the like the german has the german shepherd 

531.82 534.12 A: the airedale was the was their hunting dog 

535.18 537.65 B: okay well at least you know what you're getting then 

535.42 536.26 A: (( and )) 

537.43 538.51 A: oh yes 

538.25 539.95 B: yeah 

538.64 540.21 A: yeah 

540.46 545.75 A: yeah that that dog had a personality she used to think she was a lap dog even though she weighed eighty five pounds 

545.67 546.65 B: huh 

546.27 547.66 A: [laughter] 

547.08 547.97 B: (( [mn] )) 

548.31 552.43 A: um maybe that was our fault by letting her ha be on the lap so much when she was younger 

553.64 555.73 B: mhm 

555.47 560.71 A: or or she'd just come into a room and decide this is where i'm going to sit and take over a chair a spot on the floor and 

560.72 562.28 A: (( you c- you weren't going to move her )) 

562.36 563.50 B: uh-huh 

562.61 564.87 A: [laughter] 

564.31 567.39 B: (( yeah )) 

567.74 569.32 B: (( well ))
