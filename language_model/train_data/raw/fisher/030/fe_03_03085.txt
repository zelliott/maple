21.43 32.16 B: but ah in my house my ah i i live with my parents ah my mom and sister both have allergies so unfortunately she's got to be an outdoor cat 

25.37 26.61 A: mhm 

31.03 34.35 A: oh yeah that makes it difficult 

34.56 36.45 A: especially with the long fur 

36.50 37.53 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

37.69 44.83 A: we have um [lipsmack] let's see well we used to have three cats and now we have two ah we recently lost a pet 

45.07 52.01 A: [mn] but ah i have two little boys one's named stinky and the other named slam 

52.12 53.11 B: [laughter] 

53.36 58.23 A: and ah one's black one's white [laughter] and they are 

58.28 59.96 A: ah with me 

60.10 61.37 A: all the time 

61.80 65.95 A: [laughter] they're indoor cats they they hate the outdoors 

66.02 66.94 A: um 

67.08 71.30 A: and i don't blame 'em around here it gets a little cold in north dakota 

71.06 76.66 B: oh yeah [mn] i bet i ah live up here in ah washington 

76.05 77.39 A: oh yeah 

76.62 86.40 B: in kind of the seattle area and it rains a lot and [mn] cats don't like it it's kind of an interesting story actually how ah we ended up with this cat 

78.01 78.98 A: mhm 

85.94 87.04 A: oh really 

86.74 95.42 B: ah we had a cat before who ah we had for like ten years and ah we had her from a kitten on 

90.88 92.15 A: mhm 

95.54 100.28 B: ah but then she ended up getting hit by a car about six months ago 

99.80 100.69 A: mhm 

100.87 104.46 B: but in the meantime our neighbor's cat 

104.74 109.40 B: ah they ended up getting a new kitten which was part wild cat 

108.68 109.94 A: oh wow 

109.86 111.49 B: (( and ah )) 

112.51 117.56 B: [mn] it basically chased off this older cat who's fifteen years old 

116.88 117.97 A: mhm 

117.71 128.29 B: and the poor thing was all mangy and you know his fur was all matted and my mom started feeding it on our out on our front porch and 

119.95 121.56 A: oh man 

126.82 127.47 A: (( [mn] )) 

128.46 139.61 B: you know immediately when our you know old cat got hit by a car it kind of became our ah surrogate cat so it kind of filled the the spot of the old cat 

134.43 136.20 A: mhm mhm 

138.95 140.00 A: right 

140.08 146.64 B: but ah ever since we've been feeding her and taking care of her she looks you know five seven years younger 

146.58 147.71 A: wow 

148.39 158.08 A: see th- well it's nice that you can actually help out and and and keep a cat fed and keep it relatively safe and and happy 

158.08 159.31 B: yeah 

159.14 162.99 A: you know i hate to see all the cats ending up in the shelters 

163.14 167.75 B: yeah i know we have like a local program here um 

168.34 170.68 B: called ah hooterville 

170.00 171.32 A: mhm 

170.70 175.29 B: i know that sounds pr- like a strip club or something but ah 

172.37 173.39 A: well 

174.15 175.10 A: [laughter] 

175.68 182.17 B: it's ah hooterville pets and it's ah like an adoption agency and they do ah 

179.61 180.55 A: mhm 

183.48 186.15 B: [lipsmack] a program where they ah 

187.21 190.90 B: they actually hold the animals and they don't do ah 

191.30 196.74 B: any what do you call it where they like they don't euthanize any of the animals [noise] 

193.77 194.60 A: they 

194.84 196.13 A: right 

197.37 198.67 B: it's 

198.05 203.47 A: it's hard to keep a program like that running because there's so many animals 

201.19 202.99 B: (( yeah )) 

204.02 205.55 A: and and it's [mn] 

205.92 215.36 A: it's almost difficult to convince people to take a cat that e- especially an older cat um everybody wants a kitten you know 

215.25 219.13 B: (( yeah )) 

215.76 219.51 A: um but we've we've gotten each of ours 

219.64 225.70 A: um as hand me downs i guess you could say from people who just couldn't take care of them any more 

225.62 226.49 B: (( oh )) 

226.41 227.67 A: (( and ah )) 

226.87 229.84 B: (( yeah )) 

227.82 228.76 A: so 

228.78 236.08 A: you know i- it's rewarding and and we love to have 'em around but gosh they're they're worse than kids sometimes 

236.18 237.04 A: um 

236.22 238.21 B: yeah 

237.49 240.47 A: our ah our white cat stinky 

240.58 247.53 A: [lipsmack] um is getting older now he's i guess about fifteen and he has diabetes 

247.54 248.69 B: oh 

247.55 250.80 A: and last year he ended up with kidney failure 

250.69 253.44 B: oh poor cat 

251.94 261.60 A: yeah so ah [mn] we've been working pretty hard to to keep him healthy [lipsmack] and he gets insulin every day 

261.79 263.46 B: oh wow 

263.00 268.31 A: um and he's on a special diet he's lost most of his teeth 

268.41 271.51 A: um because of the diabetes 

270.74 272.56 B: oh poor cat [mn] 

272.56 277.82 A: but ah he's really happy he he ah has a lot more energy he actually 

277.93 284.07 A: seems like he's almost a kitten again because he feels so much healthier 

284.31 294.82 B: yeah he's lucky to have an owner that'll take care of him like that i know i had a friend who had a cat with diabetes and they couldn't afford to take care of it [mn] 

284.57 285.37 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

288.45 289.52 A: (( well )) 

294.98 298.98 B: so they had to ah give it to ah animal control 

298.26 304.69 A: right well it the diabetes itself isn't that expensive to take care of 

304.67 315.47 A: but it's all of the other things that come along with it because just like people who get diabetes they end up with ah wounds that don't heal 

315.75 322.98 A: and um they end up having circulation problems and then kidney problems go along with that too 

323.36 328.88 A: and so you know we- we've had a lot of a lot of cat vet bills but 

329.21 330.19 A: um 

330.64 335.25 A: the diabetes itself is just you know a a maybe 

335.43 341.11 A: forty dollars for a little thing of insulin every couple of months and that's not too bad 

340.80 342.71 B: yeah 

342.43 346.69 A: but ah yeah it's a lot of work they're like kids 

344.88 349.71 B: yeah isn't it yeah with the kidney failure and stuff do you have to ah 

349.91 353.66 B: have like dialysis done or is it not that bad 

352.95 359.28 A: well um no one in our area was willing to do that so what we had to do 

359.60 362.19 A: was ah give him subcu- 

362.23 375.25 A: subcutaneous ah fluids we had i._v. bags that we would ah give him an i._v. and push the fluids into his system and it would overload his system with water 

364.96 367.05 B: oh yeah 

375.33 379.31 A: and and fluid and force the impurities out 

379.54 380.92 B: oh wow 

380.65 382.53 A: yeah he hated that 

382.66 384.84 B: [mn] that's a lot of work 

383.16 384.87 A: [laughter] 

384.89 398.19 A: [mn] yeah well it it was just a little disturbing at first because you know you don't want to hurt your cat but when you're doing something that's for their own good and and that will make them feel better 

398.56 400.42 A: [lipsmack] you kind of get used to 

400.88 402.60 A: you know what you have to do 

402.33 404.11 B: yeah 

403.61 405.93 A: but ah yeah they're wonderful 

407.73 416.76 A: wonderful things [mn] um we we really wanted a dog but we have been living in apartments for so long that it just hasn't been 

416.83 419.36 A: ah feasible to get a dog 

418.75 420.79 B: yeah 

421.15 423.38 B: (( i don't think the ah the )) 

423.62 425.97 B: landlords or ah 

427.85 432.57 B: yeah the people in apartments next door would like the barking 

431.76 433.33 A: right right 

433.49 437.57 A: well and i mean it's hard enough to move 

437.72 440.77 A: and find an apartment if you have cats 

440.51 442.34 B: yeah 

440.80 444.24 A: and i think it's even more difficult when you have a dog so 

444.19 449.78 B: yeah and then you've got to take it for walks and everything and 

447.95 451.49 A: right although it's a good way to get some exercise 

451.04 457.42 B: yeah although the bad thing is if you ah you know like if you work full time and 

451.61 452.87 A: (( yeah )) 

457.58 461.61 B: there's nobody around for it they get lonely and 

459.97 466.43 A: yeah and then they end up being loud and and disruptive and because they want attention 

467.64 469.55 B: [mn] yeah [mn] 

469.50 472.45 A: well again they're just like kids you know [mn] 

471.79 474.11 B: yeah exactly 

472.71 483.82 A: i don't think people realize whenever they they initially get pets that it's ah a commitment for the lifetime of the pet you know people see 

483.88 497.31 A: [mn] this cuddly little animal and and they think it's great but they don't think long term about ah the the many years that that animal's going to be around and and how that's going to work into their lives 

497.44 501.73 A: [mn] i mean i know we've run into a lot of problems with with cat sitting 

501.77 507.49 A: because if you go if you go on vacation it's hard to find a cat sitter [laughter] 

501.82 504.17 B: [mn] oh yeah 

507.65 508.75 B: (( yeah [mn] [mn] )) 

508.60 511.89 A: you know it'd be easier if we had outdoor pets like you 

512.00 521.16 A: um because they could [mn] cats end up being a little bit you know um able to take care of themselves to an extent 

521.56 527.02 A: but ah these guys just wouldn't [mn] they wouldn't be able to handle it [laughter] 

527.50 534.41 B: yeah what we actually end up doing for the ah for the poor cat that we've got now is we put her in the garage at night 

533.78 534.83 A: mhm 

534.43 545.02 B: just 'cause there's ah you know coy ah not coyotes but raccoons and ah [mn] all sorts of stuff and it ends up where she doesn't sleep very well if she's outside 

540.79 542.21 A: right 

544.34 545.32 A: mhm 

545.06 548.42 B: she's got this spot ah right between ah 

549.69 554.31 B: [mn] it's ah like ah two sets out of a ah older car 

554.03 555.16 A: mhm 

554.50 557.23 B: we put together a kind of a little ah 

558.37 561.22 B: hiding spot or whatever for her to ah 

561.21 563.41 A: makes a nice little house for her 

562.82 569.84 B: yeah she's always out there and then we have these ah stairs which come down from the attic and she'll run right up there 

563.46 564.37 A: yeah 

569.48 570.81 A: mhm 

570.10 572.37 B: and go after mice and stuff 

572.20 575.22 A: oh see now that that's great ah 

575.41 578.53 A: do you live in kind of a wooded area 

578.21 585.49 B: [mn] um it was at one time really wooded but you know over time it's kind of um 

581.88 583.01 A: mhm 

586.18 589.15 B: [mn] you know we have a big road right by our house 

589.22 597.34 B: that's ah like i think it's three lanes and it's gotten really developed you know fifteen years ago when we moved here 

594.82 595.77 A: wow 

597.13 598.22 A: mhm 

597.71 599.89 B: you know there used to be deer that would show
