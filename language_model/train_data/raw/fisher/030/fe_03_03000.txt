106.25 107.28 A: um 

107.39 112.94 A: i think i think it's more so personality than how it looks or anything like that but it is just a just a rude

113.70 114.88 B: oh boy 

114.69 116.08 A: (( so [laughter] )) 

115.94 123.62 B: well the only thing i know about bulldogs is when i was a kid there was a family friend that had one and i used to dance with it 

123.40 124.60 A: oh really 

123.95 129.68 B: yeah it was a real big dog and i'd just sit it on my shoulders and we danced 

125.17 125.73 A: (( [mn] )) 

129.32 130.70 A: [laughter] 

131.21 138.54 A: that's neat the ah yeah this one's not quite that mature i i don't know what this one's deal is it's just 

138.52 146.74 A: ah i mean everybody else seems to love it besides me so maybe it's just a thing but i he's just i don't know [laughter] 

145.80 148.67 B: (( [laughter] some dogs are like that )) 

147.86 152.44 A: yeah so what made you decide on getting a a a german sheppard oh 

152.55 154.06 B: a german shorthair 

153.73 155.32 A: i'm sorry a german shorthair 

154.95 161.72 B: i like the coloring of that kind of dog and i just looked around until i saw an ad and went and looked at him 

162.25 165.30 B: and they're just the cutest little things when they're puppies 

166.13 166.98 B: i think 

166.29 168.95 A: [laughter] how how big did she get 

168.94 171.68 B: right now she's seventy pounds 

169.87 170.71 A: yeah 

171.17 172.16 A: wow 

172.39 177.83 B: and when i first looked at her i think she was three weeks old and 

177.93 180.13 B: i don't know if you know what they look like 

179.91 181.39 A: no i don't 

180.46 190.97 B: fu- full size they have kind of a narrow face with a long snout and when she was three weeks old all of the puppies they didn't have any snout at all 

185.40 186.34 A: okay 

191.50 193.79 B: it was just all real baggy skin 

193.58 194.78 A: [laughter] 

194.15 196.55 B: and it kind of grew into the face 

196.45 197.91 A: oh that's interesting 

197.50 198.99 B: mhm 

199.06 200.16 A: (( the ah )) 

200.74 202.58 A: (( i was going what was i going to ask you )) 

202.77 208.90 A: um as far as like the the does this dog shed a lot does it not shed a lot does it like 

208.09 217.59 B: well she has short hair and she does shed somewhat like any dog would but it's not very noticeable because it's so short 

213.53 214.45 A: (( right oh )) 

218.57 220.82 A: that's interes- a friend of my had a ah 

220.92 233.32 A: or still does i guess um a greyhound that he had rescued from from a track and i al- i always thought that that was just the neatest dog 'cause it had such short hair it seemed like it never shed anywhere although i'm sure it did 

224.78 225.64 B: oh 

226.37 227.26 B: uh-huh 

231.67 233.58 B: yeah 

233.29 243.60 A: and because it was so agile that even though it was kinda tall it ah behaved very much like a a small dog it didn't knock things over it was never kind of 

243.53 252.81 A: all over the place or anything like that it was a very ah very docile just ah sweet dog that really slept a whole lot 

252.44 253.44 B: mhm 

253.24 262.25 A: so i i always thought that if i ever did come to a point where i wanted a dog or my family wanted a dog or something like that that might be a a good direction to go 

261.76 265.80 B: yeah i've heard that those are very nice dogs when you rescue them 

266.79 268.58 B: they're just very nice 

270.34 276.88 A: yep wha- what are- like are you like in the country or are you i- in a urban area or 

276.26 279.49 B: we live in the country there is um 

279.60 283.63 B: seventy some acres that our family has 

283.40 284.42 A: (( oh wow )) 

283.93 286.99 B: my in laws live at one end and we live at the other 

287.21 290.72 B: so between us there is about seventy some acres 

290.51 293.17 A: [laughter] so your dog gets to really roam around 

292.53 298.97 B: well she might take off a little bit so we have to watch her when we let her go but 

300.40 303.62 B: she's hooked up when we can't be right out there with her 

303.51 310.65 A: right that's still better than some of the dogs that grow up in the city and stuff like that or you know i mean where they're always on a leash or they're always 

310.71 311.78 A: (( ah )) 

312.22 319.01 A: you know have to you know they- they're walking on the streets and stuff like that that that's ah a much better scenario for a pet i would assume 

315.17 317.95 B: yeah yeah 

318.81 323.02 B: especially a big dog i think they need ro- room to run 

320.83 321.74 A: right 

323.58 333.28 A: certainly yeah where where you said it's a german shorthair like what are like what is that breed of dog like known for do you know 

332.95 340.64 B: ah yeah they're hunters and she has a lot of hunting instinct right in her that we never taught her 

334.98 335.93 A: okay 

340.81 349.86 B: like my husband shoots his gun and she has the instinct to stay right by him rather than you know we were afraid she would run out 

340.84 341.65 A: (( oh )) 

350.00 354.06 B: and get shot but he'll st- she'll stay right there while he's shooting 

354.01 354.97 A: huh 

354.82 357.23 B: and she was never taught that 

358.23 367.11 A: that my parent's have a a dog it's a bit of a mutt i'm not quite sure what all it is but one of them is is like a bird dog and um 

365.11 366.29 B: oh uh-huh 

367.45 368.74 A: you if 

368.84 373.99 A: if i guess it's a he no it's a she if she hears a bird 

374.12 376.46 A: she lifts one of her front legs 

376.11 378.31 B: oh yeah she's pointing 

378.03 386.50 A: yeah so [laughter] but it's just like you said ne- never taught that never ah any of those kind of things it just kinda does it out of instinct 

378.93 380.29 B: yeah 

382.13 383.91 B: (( yeah )) 

385.56 390.21 B: yeah that's what we felt with ours too there's so much instinct there 

391.23 395.92 A: makes you kinda wonder sometimes why ah there is not more instinct in human beings 

395.87 396.98 B: yeah [laughter] 

396.76 400.92 A: (( the yeah jus- just because you're one thing or another you know what i mean i )) 

400.98 406.99 A: i was brought up in a certain area doesn't mean you specifically take after those traits or anything like that 

405.42 409.71 B: right right well dogs do i know that 

409.49 413.26 A: yeah it's it's ah interesting i guess genetic 

413.05 417.67 B: yeah yep so you've never had a dog 

413.43 414.39 A: feature 

417.31 423.76 A: ah i did growing up and actually i i have asthma and stuff like that so at at a certain age when i started getting that we ah 

420.06 420.99 B: oh 

423.93 436.40 A: we had a dog and then when when that dog eventually passed on ah we just didn't get another one we had a little ah it was like a lhasa apso mutt it looked a lot like benji but it was black and white 

435.18 436.83 B: oh uh-huh 

436.66 443.40 A: and then it it was a cute wonderful dog ah you know and ah but once i then went to college 

443.32 453.21 A: ah my parents yeah we went a number of years then without a pet and then once i went to college my parents got another dog um and but once i got away from that 

449.72 450.56 B: mm 

453.11 461.86 A: ah environment my allergies get even worse now because i think my tolerance is is significantly less in my in my system 

461.65 463.63 B: yeah 

461.85 472.05 A: ah to the pets and the animals i i can go to my parents' house now for about two hours and then about after that i really my eyes start itching and i start sneezing and stuff like that so 

466.66 467.55 B: mm 

471.36 474.37 B: yeah well that's how my husband is with cats 

474.12 475.49 A: [laughter] 

474.61 475.71 B: [laughter] 

475.98 477.09 A: (( [mn] well )) 

476.06 477.84 B: he gets miserable too 

477.78 480.36 A: he's he's a better man than me then for ah 

479.51 480.69 B: [laughter] 

480.51 482.49 A: hanging in there so 

481.82 488.61 B: we have had cats in the house too so he has lived with it 

488.77 497.86 A: there there was a girl that i i dated ah after college and and i would go to pick her up at her apartment and i wouldn't even have to be in her apartment for more than 

498.33 509.22 A: thirty seconds i wouldn't sit down i wouldn't do anything i would basically knock on the door wait for her to go and grab her purse or whatever and it would i i was so allergic to her cat that i would probably be wheezing for the next half hour 

508.70 509.78 B: mm 

509.46 512.34 A: it was just and i've never met any other pet 

512.94 523.63 A: like that that affected me that badly um and there's some that i can be around a lot and it doesn't bother me at all so it it is kind of weird th- the only way i guess i could really have one is if i ah 

523.88 525.89 A: if i had decided to ah so 

525.99 528.59 A: you could lend me one for about a month 

528.63 531.23 A: and see whether i'm allergic to it or not [laughter] 

528.87 529.61 B: (( [mn] )) 

529.67 533.24 B: yeah yeah well there is medication so 

533.27 538.55 B: you know to take care of the allergies it's so much better now than it it has been 

535.08 536.35 A: right 

538.35 539.53 A: that's true 

539.09 543.48 B: so if you ever wanted to get a dog maybe that would be the way to go 

543.77 546.84 A: that is true i i could look into that i i 

547.61 554.05 A: ah you know i i try to stay away from any unnecessary types of things like that but these days it's almost just more of a 

554.26 558.56 A: you know a histamine blocker type thing one of those not necessarily something that's 

558.69 568.52 A: you know like some of these other medications you can take are you know they are bad for your liver or they're bad for this and they're bad for that but i don't i don't think most of your allergy medications are are like that so 

563.36 564.38 B: oh 

568.05 575.70 B: my husband's been on stuff like that for quite some time and he has changed so much with his physical health 

576.32 581.64 B: um not that we c- could have a cat in the house but the dog doesn't bother him at all 

581.51 583.36 A: yeah well that's wonderful 

582.65 584.08 B: mhm 

583.60 585.84 A: that's that's really great i 

586.62 588.90 A: ah i i really think my 

588.94 594.56 A: not immune system but my tolerances are really just once i got away from them just went down the tubes i have a cousin 

593.48 594.72 B: yeah 

594.59 599.89 A: who grew up on a f- on a horse farm she went away to college and then all of a sudden she came home from college and she had
