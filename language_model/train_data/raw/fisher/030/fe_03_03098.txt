22.50 24.51 B: [laughter] 

22.85 28.20 A: [laughter] i don't know but um i guess the topic of the day is pets do you have any pets 

27.78 31.94 B: oh yeah we have three cats and a dog what 

28.46 29.99 A: oh no [laughter] 

30.76 32.90 A: oh okay i have two dogs

33.77 35.41 A: i have two boxers 

35.71 40.31 B: we have a our's is a chocolate lab and australian blue heeler mix 

40.09 42.78 A: oh wow that must be interesting looking 

42.33 48.86 B: well actually he looks like a lab but he's the size of a australian blue heeler so everybody thinks he a puppy 

48.77 50.25 A: oh you're kidding 

49.60 52.67 B: no he's three years old and he still looks like a puppy 

52.47 53.86 A: oh 

53.18 58.53 B: [laughter] you know that old theory everything's cute until it grows up [laughter] 

54.22 55.10 A: and what 

57.23 60.53 A: right and he's not gonna ever grow up apparently 

59.85 63.11 B: right exactly [laughter] 

61.69 70.05 A: it's funny 'cause one of my dogs he has a skin problem and he's prematurely grey in the face and has been since he's been two 

70.01 82.79 A: and people think he's like ten or fourteen somebody said the other day oh he's about fourteen i'm like no he's five [laughter] he just looks kinda old in the face but he isn't grey anywhere else just around his face so 

76.13 78.24 B: [laughter] 

83.00 85.55 A: but and you have cats too you said 

84.94 88.82 B: yeah we have one outdoor cat because we live in the country 

88.28 89.17 A: mhm 

88.97 94.49 B: and he he was an inside cat but he don't like being inside and then we have two house cats 

94.80 95.64 B: um 

96.01 107.96 B: we we really enjoy our cats our dog he's inside and outside and he has a a run outside he's in at night he's out when we are not home and he's out quite a bit during the day 

99.51 100.49 A: mhm 

108.09 109.01 B: but 

109.17 113.55 A: [laughter] and here we live in the city so ha it's a little bit different 

112.93 115.12 B: they have to be in all the time 

114.50 122.32 A: well they i mean we have we have what they call a yard [laughter] although it's about two two patches of grass 

118.64 120.18 B: oh yeah 

121.73 123.26 B: [laughter] 

122.37 132.59 A: but they only y- you know why they go out there but we take 'em i mean they walk a lot which i think is a lot different we used to live in upstate new york and um 

132.62 143.26 A: you know we have a yard and all that but we didn't walk 'em as much so it seems as though they're better on a leash now they walk better because we walk them all the time so 

143.44 146.07 A: um it's just one of those trade offs 

144.15 148.30 B: yeah i used to walk my dog but he always um 

148.91 153.25 B: tugged and pulled he just couldn't get the heal thing down pat 

150.10 151.04 A: [laughter] 

151.47 152.34 A: uh-huh 

152.91 153.70 A: (( ah )) 

153.27 155.96 B: so i don't walk him any more because ah i 

156.11 163.88 B: have a degenerative disc disease in my neck i just can't take it [laughter] so he he doesn't walk with me any more unless we go 

158.46 159.35 A: oh 

160.37 161.48 A: (( i see )) 

163.95 174.75 B: if we're going like ah up into the state game lands i take him out he'll run right out and get in the van and he goes straight to his leash and straight back to the door when you untie him 

170.69 171.80 A: oh wow 

174.43 175.86 A: oh my goodness 

175.23 183.69 B: he- he's really great but i'll take him with me if i go up in the state game lands because i don't have to have him on a leash 'cause there's no roads up there nobody to hit him 

180.95 181.81 A: right 

183.68 197.12 A: that must be the the lab in him too then have him come back to you 'cause boxers you take 'em off the leash [laughter] and they'll never come back they just have no they're totally they love me but they're totally not dedicated to me so 

184.02 184.99 B: and 

186.39 187.33 B: yeah 

191.58 192.89 B: yeah 

196.73 208.10 B: a friend of mine had a boxer and she finally gave it to a lady who had a ah rottweiler and had a six foot tall chain linked fence around two acres because 

206.45 207.52 A: (( uh-huh [mn] )) 

208.34 217.75 B: there was just no controlling him he was everywhere all the time he was all over town and she kept getting fined and i mean he was a wonderful dog 

215.16 216.72 A: (( they're a hard kind )) 

216.91 227.85 A: they're just not a dog for everyone and they've gotten a little too popular so people i think think they're cute but they don't understand the kind of dog that they are which is they 

227.87 236.67 A: mature very late [laughter] they ah always remain puppy like and they need a lot of exercise so 

236.57 239.27 B: yeah and a lot of attention [laughter] 

237.12 238.08 A: you know 

238.51 251.97 A: absolutely they're they're more like people than i think dogs um because they're just they ah you know my dogs think that they're supposed to be watching t._v. and they're [laughter] you know 'cause i i ended up 

242.21 243.23 B: yeah 

252.00 255.88 A: changing my work schedule so i could work at home for my dogs 

255.87 267.36 A: i mean that- that's how crazy things got 'cause the- they both had separation anxiety when they were younger that's why i got the second dog to keep the first one company but 

257.98 259.21 B: [laughter] 

267.15 275.18 A: ah it works out great for me know but at the time it's like oh these two are going to drive me to drink [laughter] they're only nine months apart 

272.20 274.14 B: [laughter] 

274.98 283.15 A: so they're they were i basically had two puppies at the same time which was just crazy we'd never do that again but um 

282.13 285.15 B: yeah we had our dog we had his brother 

285.39 291.92 B: and um we found a home for him because ah it was too much having two of 'em together they didn't listen 

291.63 292.53 A: mhm 

292.20 296.58 B: they were too into each other to pay attention to the us 

293.98 294.90 A: [laughter] 

296.12 297.12 A: sure 

296.94 308.41 B: and um so we ended up giving him away and we could not ask for a better dog i mean we spend hours with him but sometimes his hours are just he goes over and lays on his bed in the corner 

307.79 308.84 A: [laughter] 

308.64 315.35 B: and you know when he's happy he wanders out occasionally to get a little bit of petting or you know somebody to talk to him 

310.30 311.21 A: (( uh-huh oh )) 

315.42 322.08 B: but lots of times he'll just go over there and lay down and watch t._v. and watch what's going on he's really quiet 

318.88 319.64 A: sure 

322.33 330.52 B: um except for the first five minutes he's at the house [laughter] but um he's real quiet and well behaved and um 

324.67 326.35 A: [laughter] right right 

331.27 337.40 B: i always joke and say he ah swallows his food whole for fear of biting it he wouldn't bite anything 

335.60 336.72 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

338.02 344.49 B: occasionally he plays with the cats when they yeah they have to go lure him into it though 

340.08 341.26 A: oh really 

344.82 345.61 B: um 

346.02 347.08 B: but we 

347.16 352.50 B: and he won't he doesn't do any tricks well i can't say that he'll jump up for a piece of food 

351.78 352.60 A: (( [laughter] uh-huh )) 

352.55 353.75 B: but he doesn't 

354.28 358.36 B: roll over he'll chase a ball but he won't bring it back more than once 

358.32 371.24 A: right well that's better than mine i mean boxers are definitely not retrievers so you throw the ball they'll get it and then run away with it [laughter] so it took me a while to figure out i'm like why why does everybody else's dog you know why do they run 

358.94 360.29 B: but both of [laughter] 

371.19 384.44 A: and can bring the ball back but ah my dogs just didn't get it i'm like you know then i realised oh maybe i should teach him come [laughter] and then they'll come back with it but they can't carry it in their mouth like a lab can 

378.70 379.69 B: yeah 

384.47 393.15 A: so we don't really do that but they know they know how to play dead they know how to um play really dead so they're on their back um 

391.57 392.73 B: [laughter] 

393.21 401.73 A: they can catch um biscuits and stuff like that so i i apparently have too much free time on my hands that i was able [laughter] to do that but 

401.58 413.18 A: they um i think they they like anything that um makes them think a little bit you know so that it because it tires them too if you don't just do physical exercise but stuff that's 

407.82 409.71 B: (( yeah )) 

413.20 416.32 A: mentally straining on their brains as well 

416.26 425.89 A: and ah they're all the ti- i mean i can't i just walked into the other room and the two of them followed me because they just have to be on top of me so when you say your dog 

425.74 431.66 A: you know goes and lays down oh mine don't ever do that they're right on top of me twenty four hours a day 

431.61 436.43 B: see now if you stepped foot in the kitchen you have a dog and two cats around your feet here 

435.29 437.25 A: [laughter] 

436.49 441.21 B: i mean they automatically think if you step foot in the kitchen it's something for them 

440.31 442.55 A: for them exactly 

441.87 445.95 B: um now the dog he does not do dog treats whatsoever 

445.54 446.76 A: oh really 

446.38 458.19 B: no we have a little store not far from here and i used to just take him with me because the owners are friends of mine and they have a a daycare also they run a daycare out of their home and then they have a store next door 

458.36 463.90 B: and they have a chain linked fence in the back yard and the kids in the daycare just love to play with him 

464.07 470.01 B: they had a chihuahua that wouldn't let 'em play you know that i mean the kids couldn't play with him 

470.09 484.44 B: so i'd just take him and turn him loose out there with the kids and um he'd run around and you know let 'em pet him and stuff and i would get him these little beef jerky sticks they're five for a dollar so he thinks beef jerky that's his treat 

483.80 485.41 A: (( ah [laughter] )) 

484.56 490.91 B: and if it's not beef jerky he doesn't eat it and our cats are exactly the opposite to the dog 

490.30 491.74 A: they'll eat anything 

491.61 501.08 B: they catch they fetch and they don't eat anything but cat food and they don't drink anything but water you can't get 'em to touch milk you can't get 'em to touch table scraps 

501.47 502.59 A: (( [laughter] ha wow )) 

501.47 506.42 B: and the dog he'd rather have anything but dog food [laughter] 

505.46 506.60 A: really 

506.43 512.49 B: he'll eat dog food but he would much rather have table scraps even vegetables over dog food 

511.88 513.43 A: oh really [mn] 

513.25 517.82 B: yeah and i i mean i just had this discussion with my daughter the other day 

517.83 521.87 B: before we got our dog we'd had another dog and um 

522.34 528.15 B: while my sons were out walking him it was in the winter and it was really cold and they went to change 

528.80 542.01 B: you know one was going to give the leash to the other and it slipped through his hand and the dog ran across the main highway and he called him back and for the first time in his life the dog listened and ran back across the highway in front of a truck 

539.35 540.98 A: [laughter] 

542.35 545.18 B: and my daughter says to me she says well 

545.72 549.33 B: while they were discussing with one of the neighbor kids and i overheard him 

549.49 550.61 B: (( that ah the )) 

551.01 554.79 B: little neighbor girl said that ah her dog had gone to heaven 

554.80 555.79 A: (( oh ha )) 

555.04 556.63 B: that she recently lost 

556.93 561.42 B: and my daughter says no my mom says dogs don't go to heaven they don't have fools 

561.85 567.66 B: and so then they got into this little discussion about how boring heaven would be without animals [laughter] 

566.44 568.10 A: [laughter] oh 

568.02 569.34 B: and ah 

570.20 575.39 B: anyway that really makes you think just how important you know when you think about eternity without animals 

574.91 576.82 A: i can't ima- i mean 

576.20 577.30 B: [laughter] 

576.86 581.40 A: you know my dogs are just they have i think before 

581.62 592.15 A: you know i grew up with animals and stuff but never had my own dogs and waited quite some time before we could get our own dogs just because we were moving around so much 

591.98 599.89 A: and i never thought they had such distinct personalities like they do and and they absolutely fit in like sometimes i forget they're
