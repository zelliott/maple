439.20 439.77 B: (( [noise] )) 

445.24 449.06 A: and he would go outside and so there was always a flea problem 

449.18 455.72 A: and it was you'd almost never get rid of them because they laid eggs in the carpet especially if you have carpeting 

453.81 454.68 B: right 

455.90 459.27 A: and ah you have to do like a flea bomb and everything and it's 

459.48 461.81 A: it's like a r- a real mess so ah 

462.19 465.67 A: and that's always a problem with pets is is fleas 

465.65 467.86 B: what what do you use now 

468.28 475.10 A: um well no no i took care of the problem last year and that was with an another cat that i had but this with my 

473.55 474.33 B: uh-huh 

475.15 479.98 A: current cat it she's an indoor cat so it's not a problem um 

478.21 486.38 B: yeah well we use frontline because he does go out he's he stays in most of the time but he likes to go out and hunt 

486.37 487.23 A: (( oh )) 

486.99 488.26 B: we use that 

488.06 489.29 A: yeah 

488.69 495.70 B: we had a problem um he with him having tapeworms i know they can be caused by swallowing a flea or also eating rodents 

495.70 496.71 A: right 

496.00 496.80 B: so 

496.86 498.02 B: he takes 

498.04 502.76 B: anytime we notice that he's g- having a problem he takes medicine for that but 

503.74 508.00 B: we don't notice a problem really with fleas now or anything but 

509.49 510.64 B: i had him 

510.83 513.35 B: neutered in ninety eight 

513.05 513.96 A: uh-huh 

514.86 517.89 B: so i could keep him in the house because i was told that 

518.08 519.16 B: once they're 

519.50 524.90 B: six months old or so they'll start to spray and ruin your things in your house 

524.47 525.74 A: (( right right )) 

525.44 527.06 B: (( so i had him fixed )) 

528.36 531.96 B: and plus i think there's a lot of homeless animals out there as it is 

531.71 533.55 A: right yeah 

533.90 538.51 A: do you ever feed your your pets um like scraps or people food 

538.28 539.23 B: no 

540.09 542.15 B: no ah we 

542.80 546.24 B: our cat his name is oliver and um 

546.62 551.96 B: we used to he really really loved ice cream and he would give him ice cream on occasions 

551.98 552.85 A: (( yeah all right )) 

552.18 553.17 B: (( and ah )) 

553.51 555.67 B: he got to having a problem i mean 

555.96 565.03 B: i actually thought he was dying because he was drooling and and just acting very sick and he we noticed he wanted to drink a lot of water so i took him to the vet i mean 

565.05 578.82 B: i called at night it was an emergency i felt like and we got him there and it turned out to be um he had a kidney infection he couldn't urinate and it was from i guess from the ice cream you're not supposed to give them dairy products because it'll 

578.75 581.40 B: cause their urine to crystallize 

580.84 581.76 A: right 

581.62 586.82 B: and so he was really sick from that so i don't try that anymore no more milk or ice cream 

586.02 587.84 A: (( right right )) 

588.03 589.21 A: yeah i think ah 

589.25 592.78 A: ah you know that dairy products aren't good for them you know 

592.09 593.00 B: no 

592.79 594.44 A: yeah 

593.51 595.91 B: i don't i don't think it's good for their stomachs 

595.96 599.19 B: as well because they can't digest it as easily 

596.05 596.93 A: yeah 

598.99 599.89 A: right
