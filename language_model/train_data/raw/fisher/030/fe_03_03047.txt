130.06 141.13 B: okay we didn't we didn't we're not quite that [mn] as far as the dogs we we bought though actually we got both of them from a pet store ah from the same pet store and ah we've never had any troubles they've been 

136.91 137.87 A: uh-huh 

141.24 143.66 B: well you know max is still a puppy so 

143.73 149.28 B: who knows how much trouble he might turn into but um at this point he's a pretty good puppy 

150.06 151.33 A: that's neat 

151.20 154.96 B: yeah ah we like we we have always had big dogs 

154.83 155.77 A: mhm 

155.10 158.13 B: and ah we used to have a um a lab 

158.50 159.74 B: (( and ah )) 

159.65 161.45 A: we had a lab as well 

159.89 160.64 B: (( [mn] )) 

160.98 170.00 B: did you yeah we had her she was twelve years old or actually thirteen years old when we had to have her put put to sleep she finally got so old that ah and the arthritis in the back legs 

166.08 166.88 A: yeah 

170.07 173.80 A: yeah we had we had the same thing with our black lab 

170.33 171.24 B: um 

173.79 178.76 B: really yeah they i think they said it was like you know pretty much hereditary of that kind of ah 

174.46 175.45 A: yeah 

178.19 179.59 A: (( mhm )) 

178.78 180.89 B: that kind of a dog um 

180.94 187.38 B: but ah you know then we pretty much swore that we would never have another animal you know that was kinda tough to get through and and um 

185.10 186.48 A: oh yeah 

187.39 196.54 B: but then we found mandy first she's the lasso apso and she's a small dog they're you know both under twenty pounds um which is something we're not used to having around 

196.89 201.69 B: [lipsmack] we're used to having the big dogs but ah to tell you the truth i really enjoy 

198.63 199.76 A: right 

201.85 205.40 B: having the smaller ones and ah they don't shed 

205.67 209.61 B: which is like the biggest plus no dog hair around the house 

209.04 210.07 A: (( oh )) 

210.18 213.04 A: we certainly could use that [laughter] 

212.07 219.86 B: yeah i'm s- i'm sure you could and i know what it was like when we had the last [noise] um we had hair ev- dog hair everywhere so i am 

218.19 219.46 A: yeah we 

220.23 221.73 B: i'm sorry go ahead 

220.95 222.87 A: no go ahead i'm sorry 

222.54 223.56 B: um 

223.95 228.37 B: so i you know i am definitely a- appreciating that part of 

228.44 235.11 B: ah the dogs um not having to clean up the i mean there's still some dog hair around but nothing like it was with the lab 

235.55 240.86 A: yeah we have ah the golden retriever um [mn] shaved every few months 

240.84 254.59 A: because we also have a two year old and we were finding dog hair in the two year old's food so [laughter] we decided we'd start shaving her so she's due for another hair cut here now that it's starting to get warm here 

247.04 249.13 B: oh [laughter] yeah i kn- [laughter] 

254.59 259.78 B: oh right right well both of our dogs need they have to be groomed about every six weeks um 

258.79 260.30 A: yeah 

259.69 271.66 B: and we keep 'em we keep 'em cut short you know the lasso apsos and actually the shih-tzus you know peep when they show them they're you know got hair down to the ground and and ah but you know i don't have time to take care of that 

271.48 274.00 A: no that's a lot of work i can would imagine 

272.98 276.50 B: yeah oh right so yeah so i keep them ah 

276.76 280.87 B: ah trimmed they're they're pretty short both of 'em um 

281.21 289.59 B: and it's re- and it's just easier i mean ah when they start getting the hair starts getting long again it gets matted and you know it's just too much of a pain in the butt to try to 

289.76 292.02 B: to keep up with that 

292.27 299.13 B: um it would be a brushing it would mean i would have to brush them every day well you know i haven't got time for everyday brushing 

298.79 300.46 A: yeah i can imagine 

300.80 304.05 A: i know that feeling ours is pretty self 

301.08 303.66 B: [laughter] what part of the country do you live in 

304.06 310.39 A: reliant we just open the back door for her and when she wants to come back in she scratches on the door 

310.44 313.92 B: [lipsmack] you know that's pretty much mandy but now with the puppy 

313.70 326.06 B: um i i pretty much go out everytime ah when when we had mandy by herself we could just open the back door let her out in the backyard and she'd let us know when she want to come in but now that we have the puppy you know we went through the whole big potty training bit 

325.85 333.06 B: and ah you know still can't trust him send him out the back door and and he'll be following right behind me and he you know trying to pick up her 

333.13 335.31 B: her ah her her ah 

335.37 342.39 B: [mn] her dog poop and [laughter] you know so i don't know what's up with that we've we've never had that trouble with ah 

336.79 339.28 A: oh oh [laughter] 

339.89 341.13 A: [laughter] 

342.19 350.90 B: with any kind of a dog and um and and he just you know so i have to be out there i'm constantly on him smacking him when i have to and you know 

350.94 354.57 B: he's going to get the hint soon that that's not the thing to do [laughter] 

353.79 356.54 A: [laughter] you hope [laughter] 

355.90 369.47 B: right well he's also our first male dog so i don't know if it's it's the it's the male dog if it's the breed um i don't know um we've tried everything actually the last thing we tried was putting a scent in their dog food 

361.07 362.18 A: (( wow )) 

369.11 370.01 A: uh-huh 

369.80 381.03 B: you know they say the reason that they do that is because um it's to them or to him it smells like um their dog treats 

380.98 382.82 A: (( oh )) 

381.59 387.42 B: you know and now my dogs get a lot of treats they in fact every time they go out and come in they get a treat 

387.57 389.06 B: so you know th- 

389.20 392.25 B: he's not doesn't have enough brains i guess to 

392.85 397.69 B: figure out that that's not the thing to do he's gonna figure it out though because [laughter] 

398.00 400.28 B: (( it's nasty [laughter] m- )) 

399.49 401.49 A: (( it is nasty )) 

400.84 402.81 B: yeah yeah so [lipsmack] 

401.68 402.30 A: (( huh )) 

402.91 404.15 B: i don't know 

402.98 404.10 A: [laughter] 

404.46 409.82 B: but ah i don't know let's see what else can we talk about here [noise] [lipsmack] um 

410.62 413.05 A: what other kinds of dogs have you had in the past 

412.76 416.84 B: we've had ah a- to tell you the truth most of them have been mutts 

416.95 420.22 A: yeah they're always the best kind they're so loveable 

417.12 418.10 B: um 

419.73 431.42 B: to tell you the truth right um [noise] they really were the best dogs but so far and i should be knocking on wood we haven't really had any trouble with any of our dogs as far as chewing 

431.50 432.46 A: mhm 

431.81 441.45 B: you know of furniture um you know things they're not supposed to we really truly have not ever had that so you know i guess in t- in one respect we can 

434.85 435.68 A: (( [mn] )) 

441.58 443.16 B: (( be thank- -ful [noise] )) 

441.89 448.29 A: and you're pretty lu- oh yeah i had a dog before this one that was a black lab and ah 

448.71 462.20 A: she had a habit of eating the insides out of shoes she never touched the outside or other parts but would eat eat just the inside so you [laughter] you'd go to put your shoes on and [laughter] there was no insides and boy did that hurt 

453.12 455.65 B: okay just the inside really 

456.93 457.88 B: uh-huh 

462.07 464.12 B: oh no kidding no no 

463.24 465.73 A: [laughter] to ruin them take the whole thing 

465.69 472.51 B: ah right now your ah your ah golden you still have a golden retriever is that what you have um you've had any problems with that one 

469.37 471.06 A: right mhm 

472.58 481.18 A: no um sh- she's absolutely wonderful and we have four kids and she's just so placid she's 

481.16 488.84 A: definitely a dog that's made for children because our youngest one's two and torments the dog 

484.80 485.85 B: (( oh right )) 

488.75 501.63 B: oh right but but see the dog's grown up with that right so yeah so that that makes it a little bit different you know they say ah lasso apsos are are not good children dogs [noise] 

488.99 490.85 A: and the dog 

491.58 493.14 A: yeah huh huh 

501.76 507.70 B: and we have six children which are all grown and gone and we have six grandchildren 

507.83 518.97 B: um so we were a little skeptical when we first got her but you know what it it's like once you have them around kids when they're little um that doesn't seem to bother her at all 

518.96 520.47 A: that's good 

520.43 528.48 B: um you know i mean and they have to have that i mean we have the the you know can't get rid of the grandkids so it's either going to be the dog you know or ah 

525.13 526.91 A: nope [laughter] 

528.87 531.37 B: nothing actually um [noise] 

530.80 536.85 A: i was real worried the um the dog and the two year old would have a hard time because the dog 

535.07 535.63 B: (( [noise] )) 

536.97 551.26 A: the dog's really funny the dog gets real jealous of the attention the two year old gets if my husband's playing with the two year old the dog comes to me if i'm playing with the two year old the dog goes to my husband she definitely has to have attention at the same time 

551.00 552.85 B: really really 

551.48 556.43 A: but she never she's very protective of the two year old um 

554.52 555.52 B: right 

556.44 564.61 A: we ah recently built a pool and were teaching her to swim ah we have someone coming out to the house to teach her to swim 

560.44 561.58 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

564.42 565.39 B: okay 

564.79 566.11 A: and 

566.16 574.78 A: she got dunked under the water by her instructor and the dog went nuts she didn't go after the instructor but was re- yeah was running around the pool 

570.47 572.81 B: oh no kidding thought she was being hurt 

575.09 581.69 A: barking her head off worrying worrying about the baby it was really interesting to watch her 

576.88 578.16 B: oh no kidding 

579.51 580.85 B: right 

581.92 582.72 B: huh 

582.56 587.61 A: and when my husband rough houses with any of the kids the dog goes after my husband 

587.29 590.68 B: right right 'cause he's right [laughter] 

587.96 589.37 A: [laughter] 

590.01 590.83 A: so 

591.16 595.89 A: goldens are definitely [mn] children's dogs but they're such attention seekers 

591.30 592.32 B: he he 

595.93 599.95 B: oh yeah both of mine are oh yeah they don't ah you know if you're petting
