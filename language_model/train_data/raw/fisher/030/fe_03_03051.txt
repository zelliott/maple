410.92 412.26 A: right [laughter] 

412.64 413.93 B: but um 

414.63 417.34 B: for the most part what what um 

417.27 432.04 B: what happened was you know it's it's like he just kind of like interrupt and interfere and be a pain and ah i didn't want to have him around and she wanted to have him come in and you know sleep on the bed and you know 

432.43 438.49 B: jump on and watch t._v. and all of that and it's like no i don't think so 

436.62 437.52 A: right 

438.05 440.71 A: she wanted a cat that had free rein over everything 

440.10 446.68 B: exactly and the and the cat did have free rein over everything except when 

440.78 441.98 A: just spoil it 

446.69 452.21 B: i was there and it was so funny because i'd come into the room the cat would leave 

447.59 448.58 A: right 

451.86 453.80 A: [laughter] 

453.34 456.07 B: but we understood each other very well 

455.40 461.44 A: yeah yeah that's one thing i do like about animals is f- if they're their instinctiveness 

460.86 462.31 B: yeah 

461.59 470.15 A: and most most animals do you know in a in a real raw sense treat you the way you treat them or unless they've been conditioned by other people 

467.89 468.75 B: right 

470.16 473.12 A: like i lived in this apartment in new york and my neighbors 

473.31 476.61 A: um breeded rottweiler pit bull mixes 

476.96 480.65 A: so it had the body of a rottweiler and the face of a pit bull 

480.38 481.72 B: wow 

481.22 485.91 A: yeah so they were basically there to protect and attack if they didn't know you 

485.75 487.35 B: yeah [laughter] 

486.54 491.56 A: you know and like luckily i knew them when they were puppies so they were used to me 

491.61 499.05 A: but i don't care how whate- you know they were those dogs were trained in a way that you know there's nothing you can do no matter what kind of person you are 

499.80 500.95 B: okay 

500.62 506.29 A: you know i mean they were aggressive and they had a little chihuahua that would st- always start the attacks [laughter] and 

507.13 513.99 A: like the the big dogs would kind of just like growl and the little chihuahua would run after people and then that was when the big dogs would go to protect the chihuahua 

511.41 512.68 B: wow 

515.03 516.18 A: (( it was funny )) 

517.49 518.61 A: so 

517.87 520.08 B: wow [laughter] 

518.90 521.90 A: yeah no these were my neighbors' and um 

522.25 525.90 A: you know it was a kind of a working class neighborhood in new york 

528.29 530.67 A: so you like living in l._a. 

531.47 532.72 B: yes 

532.75 533.66 A: mhm

554.94 558.18 B: okay what brought you out to california 

555.81 556.69 A: did you move 

557.58 563.66 A: oh i'm an actor [laughter] yeah [laughter] it's almost too much of a cliche in l._a. but 

558.92 561.44 B: (( ah ah )) 

563.06 565.12 B: [laughter] 

563.92 565.46 A: it's where the work is 

565.19 571.12 B: well yeah i mean it's like if you are an actor this is where you probably need to be 

570.47 580.28 A: it's one of the places i mean you know it d- it depends what kind of career you want to have you know if you just want to act and you don't care about making a living from it you don't need to be in l._a. 

574.04 575.07 B: yeah 

580.32 589.49 A: if you like doing theater and getting you know enough money to get by you can do that in a lot of places but if you want to get into film t._v. you need to be here 

589.14 590.21 B: okay 

589.88 594.51 A: you know i mean there's other parts of the world parts of the country that have small film industries but

597.19 599.03 B: yeah 

598.58 599.68 A: so 

599.44 599.89 B: yeah
