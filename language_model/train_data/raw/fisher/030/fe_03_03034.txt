198.38 210.90 B: my bird um mario though my bird is a cage bird as soon as he comes out he goes looking around the floor like it's natural to look for food you know i've never fed him on the floor but he goes picking at the carpet um 

198.47 199.26 A: my 

205.94 207.72 A: oh really 

210.10 212.05 A: (( well he must be very young ))

215.70 217.58 B: yeah smart baby bird so 

217.41 218.23 A: ah 

218.69 222.05 A: i've never seen them do that though i've never had them that young 

221.36 224.06 B: you never had a parakeet have you had a parakeet before 

223.31 234.14 A: yeah i did have one ah when i was younger and no i've never seen them do that they i guess they were quite old my father had got them from the pet store he had gotten four of them 

230.08 231.42 B: mhm 

234.01 235.04 B: is that right 

235.30 237.10 A: yeah 

236.89 238.87 B: did your pets get tamed 

239.22 249.56 A: um i guess they were like hand tamed when we got them because you were able to just like put your hand in the cage and they'd be fine with that except for this one 

243.47 244.43 B: mhm 

249.73 257.42 A: but all the other ones were just like perfectly fine they were just very friendly and will sit on your hand and eat out of your hand 

252.52 253.22 B: (( were mhm )) 

257.54 261.05 B: and how long did you have your parakeets for did you have them a long time 

260.94 267.05 A: i had them for [sigh] maybe about three or four months before the cat knocked the cage down [laughter] 

266.50 267.91 B: okay and then you lost them 

267.49 268.75 A: yeah 

268.13 270.29 B: so your cats don't like parakeets 

270.05 273.08 A: ah this particular cat apparently doesn't 

272.65 275.40 B: how do you do you think maybe the cats were jealous 

275.65 282.00 A: mm i don't think so i mean i i've spent more time with the cat than i spent with the parakeet [laughter] 

280.35 282.05 B: [laughter] 

282.96 286.38 A: so the cat just kinda trailed behind me all time so 

285.08 286.16 B: mhm 

287.19 292.87 B: that's right my parakeet seems to be jealous as soon as i get on the phone he seems to come out from nowhere 

292.81 293.75 A: (( really )) 

293.39 295.35 B: yes so he does 

294.20 296.31 A: oh i never heard them do that 

296.02 296.99 B: [laughter] 

296.76 310.92 A: well i like since animals sometimes can tell when you're upset they'll like if somebody strange comes in the house they'll you know they'll be scared and be concerned about you and try and protect you and stuff like that they're pretty smart 

304.04 305.46 B: mhm 

306.38 307.46 B: mhm 

309.43 310.69 B: is that right 

311.26 316.04 B: i don't imagine how a parakeet would protect you though do you think he would go and attack 'em 

315.51 317.56 A: they will dive bomb 

316.81 318.47 B: [laughter] 

317.69 325.31 A: the person who they think is you know a stranger or an enemy they'll j- they'll fly over their head and try and peck them and stuff like that [mn] 

326.04 327.76 A: they are very protective 

327.62 335.49 B: oh so is there anything unique about your cats since you've got cats and i have parakeets and you know about my parakeets what do your cats do that are unique anything unique 

335.27 341.30 A: [noise] ah they run around at exactly four a._m. chasing each other 

341.12 342.02 B: huh 

341.70 343.02 A: every night 

343.92 349.79 A: and you can time it they'll start running from one end of the house to the other just chasing each other in a circle 

349.96 350.72 B: huh 

350.64 352.94 A: but it's just like play 

352.76 353.51 B: (( [laughter] )) 

353.26 359.13 A: it's not vicious or anything but they gallop kinda like horses chasing each other all night 

359.81 362.98 A: for a good couple of hours and then they go to sleep on my foot 

362.88 366.02 B: is that right so you don't have to put slippers on 

363.70 364.56 A: yeah 

366.20 369.32 A: [laughter] no actually no they're very warm so it's fine 

369.54 370.11 B: (( [laughter] )) 

370.24 371.32 B: wow 

371.66 373.52 B: and do your cats have names 

373.40 375.01 A: yeah ah one is 

373.83 376.30 B: i forgot what you said

378.47 382.15 B: wow that's pretty names for cats 

380.57 381.74 A: (( oh thank you )) 

382.17 384.09 B: and have you always liked cats 

384.10 390.08 A: ah yeah i'm pretty much an animal person i used to work for the humane society for a while 

389.85 399.61 A: and you know they were a dog and cat shelter and i worked with them for a really long time and it's like having fifty cats and sixty dogs you know 

399.84 407.01 A: they're like all yours and you they you know look forward to seeing you every day so yeah i do like cats and dogs a lot 

406.84 407.86 B: (( uh-huh wow )) 

408.73 412.67 B: so cats are pretty interesting i had cats but we can't have them here 

412.68 415.32 B: so i do have the um you know the 

413.25 413.81 A: (( [mn] )) 

415.79 425.94 B: the parakeet who seems to keep me pretty good company the only thing is that he's too smart you know i take um some strings and tie up his doors and he gets out of that too 

418.54 420.28 A: mm how come you can't have them 

422.87 423.93 A: [laughter] 

425.72 426.95 A: [laughter] 

426.05 432.94 B: and then when i go to look for him he's flying around and the next thing i know he's back in his cage so he's a smart bird i think parakeets are smart 

431.58 432.35 A: yeah 

432.62 440.35 A: yeah they are pretty smart um like parakeets and parrots those birds are not dumb like people think they're really not 

438.77 439.46 B: (( [laughter] )) 

440.97 441.85 B: no 

442.42 443.42 B: well 

442.78 446.41 A: well how come you can't have a cat or a dog are you allergic to them 

446.09 453.03 B: no the landlady won't let us have the cat or dog [laughter] not allergic even if i was allergic i'd have 'em because you know i love animals too 

447.75 449.45 A: oh 

450.04 451.00 A: [laughter] 

452.44 453.71 A: yeah 

453.11 455.13 B: (( i'm an animal lover and um )) 

454.47 456.74 A: oh oh that's a shame 

457.07 463.36 B: yeah that is a shame but i don't see any difference between that and the bird because the bird can be pretty messy sometimes too you know 

463.19 477.86 A: yeah well landlords they kinda like my mother ah is a landlord and their the problem is cats if they're male and they're really young they and they haven't been ah neutered they'll spray in the house and that smell never goes away
