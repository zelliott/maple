160.87 168.36 B: yeah oscars they say that's one of the the only um fish that's really like a pet because they do live so long 

168.45 173.92 B: and um you know you can you can kind of become attached to them because they're they're so long lived 

175.28 186.37 A: and they just so you know they're so they're a beautiful fish and i just i love them you know the color you know all the different fish but even though you know the other ones all the colors the blues and the yellows and all that 

185.78 187.63 B: yeah 

186.21 194.65 A: um and you know they're beautiful and you know some seahorses thrown in there for good measures but um i like the oscars of all the fish and 

194.05 196.33 B: so then you have another saltwater tank 

195.74 197.11 A: yeah 

197.42 199.09 B: how big is that 

198.47 201.06 A: that's a small one it's like twenty five gallon 

201.25 211.37 A: and it's mainly ah a transfer tank that you know we use when we bring fish in to ah you know get them ah a- you know a lot of the water from you know from the shop 

211.57 212.56 A: um 

212.50 214.66 B: but the oscar that's a freshwater fish 

214.01 217.76 A: that's freshwater fish but i'm saying the larger tank is is a freshwater tank 

214.92 215.86 B: (( oh okay )) 

217.48 219.83 B: oh i thought you said it was saltwater sorry 

219.12 222.24 A: no the saltwater tank is is the you know it's a small one 

222.36 225.21 A: with the oscar you it's a freshwater tank so 

224.62 226.36 B: right right 

226.70 231.32 A: and as i said um you know i've just been had it for had him for a long time and it's just kind of 

231.40 233.67 B: so what's his name i'm sure he has one 

232.85 237.75 A: [laughter] ah his name is pepe 

237.65 239.23 B: [laughter] 

238.46 246.59 A: [laughter] because that's what he does a lot when we see him yeah we used to clean the water we had to change the water a lot you know because that's what he was doing 

246.81 249.12 B: let's see we we have um 

250.19 251.83 B: we we only 

251.88 254.43 B: i'm trying to think if we named any of our fish 

254.90 259.64 B: i know the the one fancy goldfish we had was all black 

260.17 261.90 B: and he looks like ah 

262.24 264.36 B: admiral akbar from 

263.37 264.89 A: [laughter] 

264.49 269.10 B: from star wars so we were calling him that for a while and then ah 

265.33 266.39 A: (( oh really )) 

267.16 268.15 A: (( oh )) 

269.96 281.70 B: and then he start i guess this happens with goldfish sometimes they tend to lose their color as they age especially the black ones it's kind of rare to see a a very a very dark older black goldfish 

276.38 277.30 A: right 

281.75 287.79 B: and so he started turning almost i mean almost white and so then we started calling him michael jackson 

287.52 292.99 A: (( oh really [laughter] oh michael jackson )) 

288.26 289.22 B: (( yeah )) 

291.52 296.09 B: but ah yeah he was he died not too long ago and then one of my fish now 

296.59 300.47 B: um he's he's all white and he um 

301.01 304.52 B: i don't know i think there's something wrong with him he's always swimming upside down 

304.21 305.56 A: oh really 

304.89 314.43 B: yeah and so i took in a a sample of water to the fish store the pet store where i bought him and they said you know my water chemistry was all screwed up and 

314.35 324.07 B: which it was well i got that cleared up now and he still swims upside down every now and then it's not like he does it all the time but sometimes you know when i wake up in the morning i'll go down look at the tank 

320.57 321.52 A: mhm 

324.24 326.65 B: and he's just kind of sitting upside down 

326.42 328.26 A: (( [laughter] )) 

327.26 329.49 B: i guess it's just comfortable for him 

328.67 330.24 A: yeah maybe 

330.42 339.23 A: maybe maybe he developed that after he you know like you said the water the micro bites in the water might have been you know too high and then i guess maybe that's what was doing 

339.68 341.63 A: (( but ah it's they're )) 

340.69 341.73 B: (( yeah i don't )) 

341.72 345.95 A: quite interesting ah i was we were at um 

346.51 354.44 A: ah what is it the bahamas ah atlantis or i don't know if you've ever gone there or not but you know they have where you can walk through 

354.51 357.77 A: ah like ah and you can see all the fish they got ah 

358.61 366.03 A: it's almost like walking through and the fish they they're overhead and they all si- they all around you except for under- underneath you and you walk through 

366.08 367.74 A: you see all these fish it's 

367.28 369.59 B: know oh is it an aquarium or are you in the water

460.38 461.66 A: exactly 

464.20 466.32 A: no it's not and actually 

464.97 467.17 B: you know they're really building it up and 

466.52 472.58 A: right six i guess about seven years ago ah when we we just kind of got to this area seven 

472.40 481.97 A: and there wasn't a whole lot going on then but now it's in the past three well three years or four years it's boomed and everything's built all around the place 

481.78 482.70 B: yeah 

482.07 491.51 A: actually they're widening four hundred um making extra lanes and exit ways yeah so um it's got real real real quite 

485.72 486.89 B: oh are they 

491.35 498.14 B: are they doing that all the way down to um you know where it hits seventy five or just you know north of like 

496.05 496.88 A: ah 

498.27 500.15 B: north of roswell or 

499.67 504.06 A: well it's all the way from um amernethy 

504.38 505.60 A: um 

505.91 510.19 A: all the way past the exit ah eleven to into forsyth county way 

505.95 506.81 B: north 

510.63 514.17 A: so because we were at exit number eleven and fo- and um 

514.24 519.69 A: fulton county forsyth county started exit thirteen so we were like ah an exit two before the next county 

519.38 520.20 B: okay 

519.88 527.86 A: so we are right near the end of um you know the county and it stops and go to a full lane ah about the next two or three exits though 

527.96 532.02 A: we're about five miles ah from the actual termination point or the actual 

532.03 534.75 A: you know part of it and you know it goes to four lane 

535.78 539.86 A: oh man so ah you going to acquire any more fish any time soon 

539.80 541.86 B: um i don't think so 

542.16 546.12 B: they're ah i mean they're g- they're pretty big you know they get 

542.86 544.35 A: they're a lot of work huh 

544.38 545.70 A: [laughter] 

546.31 550.59 B: they get the ones i have are about probably 

550.64 556.47 B: six inches from head to tail now you know but they got long pretty long tails they're all in a 

552.46 553.48 A: mhm 

556.60 558.17 B: thirty eight gallon 

558.27 563.49 B: gallon tank so yeah i don't think i'll be getting anymore they're all so expensive the fancy goldfish 

559.33 560.28 A: (( oh okay )) 

563.20 564.59 A: oh yeah 

564.00 574.96 B: you know i mean they're if you buy them when they're any decent size which is like a couple of inches in my mind they're they're going to be like i don't know over ten dollars 

570.84 571.71 A: right 

575.60 576.51 B: so 

577.03 581.91 A: i know oscars are expensive but you know you normally they'll only sell in pairs 

577.23 578.20 B: i don't know 

582.04 586.06 A: a lot a lot of times the only way they do it because they need to have a companion 

585.73 587.16 B: oh yeah 

586.25 591.47 A: yeah and that's a that's a downside about it and you have and some die off and like i said this one is 

591.71 595.72 A: had you know a number come and go and he's kind of stayed you know um 

595.98 598.05 B: so do you feed him live fish
