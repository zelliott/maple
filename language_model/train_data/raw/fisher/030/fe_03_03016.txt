58.60 63.33 B: i've got ah we had four cats one of them died last week so we've got three cats 

63.37 75.92 B: and i'm home a lot now 'cause i'm sort of under employed so you know i'm spending a lot of time with them so far as like actually individual attention like petting them you know periodically throughout the day probably

90.01 91.41 A: mm oh really 

90.73 97.82 B: um and actually sometimes sleeps sort of huddled in my arms so that you know i guess that counts as time spent with the pet 

94.25 95.35 A: (( [laughter] )) 

97.15 98.08 A: oh 

98.36 99.27 A: so

121.55 122.44 A: (( you know )) 

122.45 128.32 A: and you go go out there it's 'cause like she's a pretty big dog you know so we can't bring her in to the house 

128.22 129.41 B: right 

128.84 132.93 A: so she got her own house outside the outside our house 

133.46 139.22 A: and so like on the weekend i come home and i come out there and i just play with her in the yard you know cha- 

138.26 140.93 B: so the do- the dog has a dog h- where's the dog sleep 

141.04 143.59 A: um the dog sleep in her own house 

143.39 145.85 B: oh wow you built like a little wooden dog house 

145.39 148.49 A: yeah yeah it's it's a wooden dog house yeah 

148.24 151.66 B: wow what happens when it gets cold at night is it heated the little dog house 

151.50 156.28 A: um well actually no 'cause um we we put like blanket out there 

156.12 156.91 B: uh-huh 

156.62 163.84 A: and like we we we patterned the thing pretty ah secure and um the dog house like actually my dad make the dog house 

163.78 164.83 B: (( yeah )) 

164.27 173.59 A: so like he put a door on there so it's keep the heat in there you know so it doesn't let the wind come in like other dog house they have just like a door 

168.76 169.54 B: right 

174.05 174.86 B: uh-huh 

175.27 184.00 A: but um my my dad he made it c- ah he make kind of like a a little s- swinging swinging door so the dog can just go in and the door will swing shut 

185.25 186.51 A: yeah 

185.92 190.22 B: so the dog can get in and out it doesn't need somebody to come he can come in and out 

188.72 191.98 A: yeah yeah the do- the dog can get in and out yeah 

191.29 196.69 B: gotcha and then you can hear the dog like if something happened at night or something you'd be able to hear it from inside the house 

195.16 202.95 A: yeah yeah yeah actually like ah she's pretty good at guarding guarding the house like people walking near my house she start barking 

202.96 203.78 B: (( right i )) 

203.82 204.66 A: (( yeah sure )) 

203.97 208.22 B: wonder how much cold they can take before they need you know additional blankets 

206.68 217.18 A: um depend depend on how what kind of dog it is like like dog with thick fur you know they they can and like they're big they they can they can take a lot 

212.80 214.54 B: (( yeah )) 

216.81 225.37 B: yeah you think you think what into the thirty degree range i'm just ah always curious about that guess it depends on where they're from maybe and what their breed is like and 

221.41 222.36 A: (( um )) 

223.73 224.53 A: (( ah )) 

224.66 228.29 A: 'cause like it doesn't get that cold in sacramento where i stay 

227.26 229.84 B: right that's a good that's a good point yeah right 

228.81 233.10 A: yeah it's um usually how many degrees does it get down to do you 

234.46 236.17 A: (( know [noise] yeah fifty )) 

236.67 240.09 A: [noise] yeah it gets down to around like fifty at the coldest 

240.20 244.35 B: right and they can probably take that it's not that bad yeah 

241.63 248.93 A: yeah so they can take that 'cause like when when we had her when she was like a puppy we usually put her in the um 

249.18 253.69 A: in the in in the room where we do our laundry in the laundry room 

253.72 254.52 B: uh-huh 

254.74 259.40 A: but then since she got she got kind of big she we just ha let her out 

259.64 262.50 B: did she get sad that she can't come in the house is that a big deal for her 

262.46 263.44 A: um 

263.67 266.61 A: yeah she gets sad sometimes but um 

267.42 273.43 A: but then like when i see her sad i just go go out there and play with her a little bit yeah but um 

271.42 272.45 B: right 

273.64 276.41 A: right where our back yard is it's

285.09 285.88 B: uh-huh

320.81 332.49 A: [laughter] yeah she just stayed there a- a- and and you know just stayed there so so we took her in then we start feeding her and stuff like that right and so she became our pet but the weird thing is 

332.74 337.23 A: w- as she get older like when i s- when i try to pet her 

337.43 339.51 A: she would turn around and bite me

379.26 382.11 B: yeah she might have been abused or or who knows you know 

381.64 392.28 A: yeah i i i don't know what happened but um this was way back when we were living in an apartment so when when we moved my dad was like you know this cat is is is not very friendly

392.05 394.75 B: [laughter] right poor cat yeah 

392.76 393.73 A: so 

393.92 407.17 A: yeah and so like we just we brought her near like an asian market and like near the dumpster and then we just let her loose there so like you know it in case she she need food she can just go to the dumpster and get food 

399.23 400.00 B: uh-huh 

406.82 408.12 B: right 

407.52 411.85 A: yeah so sh- we just left her there then we just [laughter] go 

411.77 414.13 B: yep wow 

412.92 422.55 A: yeah but it was weird but like when i was young i remember my family have like like a couple of cats and they weren't like that you know 

422.50 425.07 B: did you feel sad leaving the cat by the dumpster 

425.46 427.24 A: yeah i feel kind of sad 

427.54 431.97 A: but at the same time like the cat it got like no love for us 

431.86 432.87 B: no love 

432.06 445.07 A: yeah yeah you know like i mean like we took it in we haven't done anything to it like we start feeding it right and like they turn around and like it bit me it bit my brother and then they bit my dad too 

434.15 435.02 B: yeah 

438.92 440.03 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

444.90 447.85 B: and you were actually buying like cat food for the cat right

447.91 448.93 B: yeah 

450.63 454.20 B: probably better than cat food buy the food you had and then you know whatever you had 

453.82 457.60 A: yeah ah you know we we were feeding it like cat food too 

454.71 455.51 B: (( yeah )) 

458.18 465.26 A: but i i really i i don't know what happened like we bought a litter box and we spent like a quite a bit on the cat 

458.19 459.30 B: (( yeah )) 

465.05 466.34 B: right 

465.69 471.68 A: but um yeah it it it was odd you know it the cat was just totally different from my dog 

472.34 474.44 A: [mn] like my dog when she 

472.75 478.36 B: yeah dog totally affectionate yeah dogs are cats are more fickle that way they're you unpredictable you know 

477.90 485.82 A: yeah but but i mean like usually cat it's supposed to be more affectionate than dog you know dog sh- she likes to play rough and 

485.69 494.41 A: like to play catch and stuff like that but cat cats supposed to be like near you and then she always like rub against you and and she always want attention you know 

487.89 488.98 B: sure 

494.40 495.51 B: yeah 

494.90 497.47 A: but this cat it just weird 

496.72 500.69 B: strange maybe abu- probably an abused cat that's probably why she ran away or something 

500.54 501.50 A: yeah 

500.81 501.84 B: that's sad 

502.28 504.35 A: yeah but like another thing is 

502.71 510.51 B: but ah hopefully hopefully hopefully she got by you know sh- you put her near a dumpster and there was food and maybe somebody spotted her or something so 

505.83 506.81 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

512.06 514.58 A: yeah hopefully [laughter] 

513.99 515.10 B: (( that's cool )) 

514.94 521.91 A: but um the the other thing is like my my for some reason like my dog she hates the cat 

522.08 524.70 A: huh so when when we brought the cat in 

524.94 528.71 A: she every time she sees the cat she always wants to chase it 

528.09 528.72 B: (( [noise] ))

531.84 533.05 B: yep

536.07 536.96 B: (( [laughter] )) 

538.24 539.48 B: right 

539.86 541.14 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

540.16 545.05 B: so you don't have to take your dogs out for a walk right i mean a dog just lives lives outdoors 

542.98 544.72 A: (( [noise] yeah ah )) 

545.43 551.85 B: yeah in the city like you have you know in um in an apartment you have to take the dog out it's like a whole thing three times a day
