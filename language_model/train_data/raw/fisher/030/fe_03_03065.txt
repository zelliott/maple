5.77 7.60 A: i'm good regina 

7.05 14.63 B: okay well this topic sounds pretty simple they're talking about pets and they would happen to pick a person who's a pet owner [laughter] 

14.98 17.58 A: oh wait are you you are a pet owner 

17.11 22.40 B: yes i am not that you have to be they said they just said the topic of the day is pets 

21.79 30.51 A: right yeah no that'll make it easier for us 'cause i don't have any pets so i'll just be talking about other people's pets and you know 

25.53 26.43 B: oh okay 

29.26 42.23 B: that's uh yeah all the all the routine stuff and the let's see the first question they asked i think was how much time do i spend with my pet actually i own a dog it's a cocker spaniel he's a pure bred he's 

41.69 44.50 A: (( oh those are my favorite dogs [lipsmack] )) 

43.71 49.84 B: he's so funny and cute i swear i've had him since he was a pup 

49.94 59.80 B: so that was like what ah eight weeks nine weeks old he's will soon be seven this summer he has the same birthday as mine i thought that was bizarre [laughter] 

59.20 61.80 A: oh that's so cute 

60.16 61.46 B: but he really 

61.38 65.74 B: he really is precious now as far as genuine time i spend with him 

65.62 76.61 B: because of the hours that i work my mother winds up taking on like half the day so all in all i may spend i mean in terms of face to face contact 

76.66 91.15 B: probably about um [lipsmack] maybe two or three hours a day now as far as real quality time [laughter] is concerned that's usually for the weekends when i usually go and take him out and we go play ball and whatnot 

91.10 92.93 B: so he's really a sweetie 

91.13 92.33 A: right 

93.58 96.37 A: right wow what color is he 

95.80 104.76 B: he's a he's actually buff it's funny i actually got when i got the papers i'm like ooh you have a. k. c. parents but i won't be breeding you [laughter] 

104.55 106.05 A: (( wait what is he )) 

105.59 108.52 B: a. k. c. american kennel club 

108.50 110.24 A: oh okay 

110.54 120.29 B: and so when i got his papers i'm like oh so you came from like real pure bred lineage and i was like well that's all nice and everything but i wasn't planning to breed him because 

120.09 125.80 B: i wasn't too keen on the fact of increasing the pet population by accident or otherwise 

125.50 132.76 A: oh wow that is a good point all the hunger we have in the world we really need to breed more pets yeah 

126.22 127.22 B: so i want 

129.50 130.39 B: mhm 

132.18 143.86 B: right so i wound up having him neutered now as far as the other question how important he is to me well considering you know i'm a single person my dog is my child [laughter] 

143.67 145.63 A: oh 

144.74 145.98 B: so it's like i 

145.80 152.51 B: so i spoil him rotten i give him people food which i shouldn't take him regularly to the vet try and buy him 

152.31 161.14 B: toys he's just he's just really great company when all he does is just you know sit there and look over his shoulder at you saying what do you want 

161.32 169.81 A: yeah those are beautiful dogs i mean ah do you find them to be smart though i heard something like cocker spaniels aren't that intelligent 

169.26 176.08 B: [laughter] ah well i'm trying to think because i did actually take him for training for a time 

176.17 187.99 B: i wouldn't i wouldn't say he's dumb i would say that i you'd have to probably work with him to get him into the habit of doing stuff stuff i do routinely with him like tell him to sit tell him to stay 

187.94 195.56 B: ah he'll follow that as long as he feels you know like he wants to but when he's like something is more intriguing forget it [laughter] 

196.16 200.17 B: like oh i want that ball in the corner so i don't wanna sit right now [laughter] 

199.58 204.59 A: right yes exactly like all people in a way but 

201.79 202.68 B: but 

202.95 203.99 B: yeah 

205.19 219.90 B: but all in all he has he has he has his moments he he's he's not aggravating he's not ah he's not noisy that's one of the main reasons i got him i wanted a dog that would be perfect for an urban environment which is where i live 

219.01 220.52 A: (( oh )) 

220.13 224.33 B: and also at the same time you know could deal with ah 

224.27 231.88 B: apartment or a small house life in an urban setting and at the same time would not be noisy i have ah 

231.80 244.06 B: my other half i call my boyfriend my other half he owns chihuahuas i'm like you gotta be kidding [laughter] i'm not saying chihuahuas aren't cute or anything like that but they're noisy they bark at 

235.31 236.79 A: (( aw )) 

243.08 244.81 A: yeah they are noisy 

244.12 246.80 B: they bark at every little thing whereas 

246.13 248.39 A: that little high pitched 

247.37 259.67 B: yes and i'm like my dog is at least selective if something is wrong he barks doesn't bark for like every random noise that he hears or if or if another dog would pass on the street so he's good in that sense 

259.91 264.61 B: so i can always get a decent night's sleep and not have to worry about [laughter] other things 

264.56 265.94 A: wow 

266.33 268.56 A: yeah those are um 

269.13 274.33 A: if i were to have a pet in the future that'd be what i'd have that or fish or um 

274.66 279.25 A: a siamese cat i love siamese cats i think they're beautiful 

277.63 289.82 B: i had a girl friend who had one once they are so pretty i i i'm in general i'm a i mean for the most part i'm an animal lover throughout i don't think i know of too many pets that i don't like 

282.15 283.49 A: they are 

289.79 298.26 B: um some exotic animals i'd probably have to learn to handle before i liked them like snakes i'm like oh i don't know if i wanna snake [laughter] 

298.28 302.78 B: grass snake or otherwise [laughter] well some people say they're great pets [laughter] 

303.16 306.92 A: right yeah i know somebody um has a 

307.20 309.06 A: has rats as pets 

309.26 318.81 B: well i know for for me i'm like hm i'm like okay if they were raised in the proper environment maybe i've seen i've been around do- 

310.12 312.01 A: i'm not a fan of that 

318.57 324.82 B: i've only owned dogs but i've been around people who have had cats birds fish 

324.94 338.78 B: actually ah a family friend of ours had ah basically like practically a barn because they lived in a more rural setting out in connecticut so they had dogs cats birds fish roosters at one point they even had a cow [laughter] 

338.85 340.17 B: i'd a i was like 

339.39 341.18 A: they had a cow 

340.56 346.70 B: yeah they did it was it was like they had enough space where they had one cow i think they actually would 

346.77 356.45 B: ah leave it in like the front i don't want to call it the front yard but [laughter] in a way that's what it was i was like when did they get a cow i was used to all the other animals 

355.69 360.85 A: wow so they weren't trying to do anything with it milk it re- you know 

359.46 367.62 B: i don't know i never knew why they owned that cow i think it was kinda short lived but inside it was a wonderful menagerie 

367.96 379.16 B: and no i think pets are important to teach people in general how to be more humane if you will because i do not like it when i see any type of animal abused or mistreated 

378.98 384.41 B: i mean i think that's just plain wrong and you have no sense of humanity of you do such a thing 

384.59 387.33 A: (( hm absolutely )) 

387.38 393.63 A: yeah that does it makes me really sad because i feel like they're so trusting and dependent of human beings 

393.14 394.15 B: mhm 

393.58 403.77 A: when they are you know not always but when they are you know it took something for them to trust this um sort of foreign species of control and everything and then 

404.30 408.08 A: ah wow it just made me think in a 

408.14 413.29 A: whole in a whole separate direction of this movie have you ever seen that movie um radio flier 

413.03 416.13 B: i've heard of it but i have not seen it 

416.19 428.94 A: yeah it had um there was a dog in it that was really really important to the little boy and you know the whole time the step father is abusive to both of the little boys um both his girlfriend's little boys 

428.80 436.69 A: and um you know you're you're rooting for them to get out of there but then the really low point is when he 

436.79 442.09 A: ah gets that they love this dog too much and it's making them too happy apparently you know 

441.09 442.07 B: (( uh-oh mm )) 

442.11 447.43 A: ah and that the dog's a threat to him and he just shoots the dog in front of these little kids 

445.46 446.70 B: oh 

447.36 449.56 B: (( oh no )) 

449.08 459.16 A: right and you know and i'm watching the whole time and i mean you know ah abusing children is obviously disgusting and unacceptable and despicable and all that good stuff and 

458.93 470.69 A: deserves to be prosecuted but there's this sense that the children can speak for themselves to some extent they can go to they can you know do something but it's like that dog didn't have nothing to do with nothing [sigh] 

463.64 465.50 B: mhm right 

470.80 471.73 A: (( you know )) 

471.34 480.75 B: you got that right i can truly understand that point man oh it's like we won't go into quote unquote dog movies or pet 

480.70 483.61 A: old yeller and all that stuff yeah 

482.30 488.41 B: oh yeah don't start i i grew up on benji movies benji could pull a heart string off a anyone [laughter] 

487.94 495.72 A: oh god that's right i have not seen a benji in so long i remem- i did use to watch that when i was little 

492.20 493.33 B: that 

495.26 506.00 B: yeah it's like and then the funny thing is i'm like gee it's like does he in essence still exist any more because i don't see any more it's like every now and again you may run across a lassie movie 

505.89 513.48 B: but ah benji was all benji would just pull you benji was part cocker spaniel too i found out [laughter] 

512.83 525.20 A: oh wait wait wait maybe i'm getting them confused so who was benji then wait i know who lassie is that's that pretty dog benji was sort of like a scruffy looking dog right 

517.02 518.15 B: (( benji )) 

519.64 520.71 B: mhm 

523.83 530.58 B: yes he was a he was a he was a mixed breed mutt he had he was like part cocker spaniel and part something else 

530.36 540.25 B: and he always he was staying with some type of family he was real independent minded but he always seemed to manage to ah help somebody out who was 

540.06 547.13 B: in the midst of another person or group that was trying to do wrong usually involving children families children or whatnot 

547.09 557.15 B: like oh i forget one episode in particular i think ah he wound up taking care of these leopard cubs whose mother was shot 

556.23 557.91 A: oh no 

557.82 571.13 B: it was amazing oh it it really was it's like here this dog is taking care of three leopard cubs you know going out and finding food and even when his owner was calling him and looking for him out in these woods he wouldn't leave 'em [laughter] 

571.44 574.75 B: it was really touching [laughter] and then at the 

573.77 576.99 A: and these leopard cubs didn't give him a scratch or two 

576.55 585.73 B: oh ah no actually they followed him like he was mother it was so sweet [laughter] it really was touching and in the end 

582.06 583.22 A: (( aw )) 

585.54 592.41 B: when you ah when he is so close to ah 'cause the main thing is he sees another 

592.58 599.95 B: ah another leopard with a baby and he's trying to get these these three to basically connect he's
