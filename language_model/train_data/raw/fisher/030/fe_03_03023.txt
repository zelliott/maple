174.48 179.14 B: maybe we'll have a l- you know in texas everybody wants a like a little spread so 

178.99 182.79 A: yeah texas i guess it would be a little bit more feasible to have a horse 

183.32 184.22 B: yeah 

183.56 184.39 A: but 

185.02 187.96 B: so i think that would be nice to have oh 

185.82 186.73 A: that's 

187.34 191.80 A: well i'm a teacher and we had a class pet and that wa- that was ah 

191.94 194.42 A: they were crawdads we had three of them 

193.98 195.24 B: okay 

194.81 198.11 A: so the kids liked them they couldn't really touch them or anything but 

198.64 201.78 A: they were pretty they were pretty active so that was cool 

201.81 207.18 B: okay what would be if you had a if you were going to get an exotic pet what would you consider 

207.72 209.34 A: (( oh geeze )) 

211.04 215.34 A: well my fiancee had an iguana i don't know if that's considered an exotic pet 

214.65 215.93 B: definitely 

215.45 218.89 A: and that one wasn't too exciting to me 

218.41 219.55 B: [laughter] 

218.91 226.35 A: [laughter] they're i mean they're not necessarily mean but their skin is rough and they have really sharp teeth and 

225.57 227.69 B: how do you feel about cats 

227.65 229.03 A: i don't like cats 

228.79 232.42 B: okay it's amazing you're either a cat person or a dog person okay are 

229.43 230.12 A: ca- 

231.81 238.37 A: yeah i i mean they're independent and i guess if my kids one day want a cat i mean i'll go with it but 

238.46 241.71 A: they're just not they're not exciting enough for me 

242.19 245.81 A: i think a a good trop- exotic would be like 

246.87 251.18 A: [sigh] like a rare form of a bird like some type of parrot or 

249.43 250.28 B: (( you yeah oh )) 

251.46 252.99 B: (( okay that would be cool that would be )) 

251.59 253.24 A: i think those would be cool 

254.26 259.39 A: but they're not necessarily very exciting either i mean i guess you can't do too much with them 

258.08 260.94 B: cool no ferrets nothing like that huh 

260.26 261.35 A: no 

261.09 262.08 B: (( [laughter] okay )) 

261.76 269.57 A: [laughter] i i worked i was i'm a science person and in college i worked with rats so that just is too close to me 

269.43 275.03 B: [laughter] i i like that we have a little in common i don't like hamsters [laughter] 

274.43 277.44 A: yeah they're not too 

276.07 290.67 B: no well my little girl is after me very she wants a pet really really bad she's five years old and everytime she sees a puppy s- can we take it home can we take it home but i plan to buy her a german shepherd 

286.99 288.19 A: yeah 

290.60 291.22 B: (( puppy )) 

290.62 292.63 A: oh that's a good dog 

292.07 302.68 B: yes i think that's a good dog and the reason i plan to buy her one is because i know about their temperament and plus i'm i i my and they got machoism okay 

298.55 299.64 A: right 

302.23 303.81 A: (( yeah )) 

303.44 306.18 B: can't you know i don't want like a poodle you know 

305.96 309.94 A: yeah little dogs see if you have a little dog you might as well have a cat 

309.32 311.92 B: (( [laughter] mm )) 

310.33 313.47 A: i don't like little rat dogs they're not too exciting 

313.75 314.53 A: (( yeah )) 

315.14 320.17 A: little dogs i agree don't our wiemeranas are pretty big and 

320.27 322.74 A: that was another reason i would 

322.79 328.44 A: i we only had the the three year wiemerana at first and that's why we got another one because 

328.45 333.87 A: they are they're big and the companionship like they get lonely if if you're not there all the time with them 

333.58 335.57 B: and what's the temperament of them 

334.90 345.11 A: but their temperament they're they're real like they're real hyper dogs but they're real happy and they're really really good around kids like they're they're even though they're hyper they're still 

339.70 340.80 B: (( oh okay )) 

341.60 342.51 B: (( all right )) 

345.16 351.43 A: gentle around kids and like we've had them around his nephew and niece and they've been really good so 

351.81 353.68 A: that was good about them too 

353.21 356.50 B: okay what's peculiar about one of them 

356.55 357.83 A: (( what's peculiar )) 

356.68 362.78 B: what you would consider that's peculiar you know because all dogs animals have like personalities and 

362.17 363.58 A: right 

362.88 364.25 B: temperaments 

364.14 365.79 A: i think their biggest 

366.11 369.22 A: difference from other dogs is like we'll take them 

369.32 378.92 A: on a two hour hike and they'll just be you know all over the place having having a great time and then we get home they still want to play 

378.50 379.59 B: [laughter] 

379.15 392.27 A: like i think that's weird to me most dogs would be tired and not want to play anymore and they still want to play which is weird to me but and another thing their eyes are are really pretty they're like a greenish color 

381.39 382.50 B: (( [laughter] oh okay )) 

390.86 393.69 B: (( hm )) 

392.72 393.75 A: and 

394.63 400.74 A: and they really stand out like i don't notice that in other dogs most other dogs i think their eyes tend to be a little bit darker 

402.37 403.71 A: so that's cool 

403.44 409.73 B: oh so would you ah ever plan to buy another one or do you breed them or anything like that 

409.14 416.52 A: no we don't breed um all we'll probably buy one like if one of them passes away heaven forbid um 

416.69 419.23 A: then we'll probably look into getting 

419.99 422.16 A: getting a couple more but they 

422.44 429.86 A: they're best in twos so i don't know we'll s- we'll see what happens i've never been around an older one like ten or eleven 

429.87 431.56 A: so i'm not too sure 

431.79 433.79 A: how they are when they're older 

433.38 435.62 B: yeah when you were growing up did you have pets 

435.68 438.70 A: yeah i had a black lab 

439.08 442.17 B: okay what what was the black lab's name 

439.09 440.78 A: and her name was toby 

441.67 442.62 A: toby 

442.32 444.74 B: toby toby and how long did you have toby 

444.47 451.02 A: toby's still alive she's she's going strong we had her i think we got her when i was in the fourth grade 

445.62 447.73 B: [laughter] 

447.96 449.53 B: (( [mn] hm )) 

451.04 453.88 A: and now i'm two years out of college 

453.36 455.27 B: yeah that's yeah well toby is 

454.45 460.97 A: so yes toby is toby's getting very old though um she lives with my parents 

456.57 459.45 B: hm 

460.98 462.03 A: and 

462.31 463.76 A: she's very cool 

464.38 467.70 B: and when you were a little girl did ah toby used to protect you 

464.62 465.43 A: but 

468.12 469.45 A: um 

469.52 473.13 B: now the reason i say that is like a girl in my neighborhood when i was young 

473.33 485.29 B: and she had a shepherd that's why i want to get my little dog my little girl one because now the the dog was very very very friendly i mean anybody could play with this german shepherd he was a beautiful full blooded german shepherd 

473.40 474.32 A: right 

485.34 490.97 B: but if you looked like you was raising your hand or you know you could barely play with her 

491.17 504.96 B: because the dog was real protective of her if the dog thought and the dog she would walk to school and because we lived like right near the school and she would c- and she like lived four houses down they would like walk to school the dog would wait on the corner 

501.25 502.14 A: mhm 

505.39 515.61 B: for her and when she came out of school he would walk her home and i was like wow this is amazing and then from doing a little studying about ah german shepherds that's their temperament just their nature you 

506.32 507.19 A: right 

515.82 522.17 B: know they're really really friendly but they're protective of their owners yeah and i was like that's neat yeah you know 

518.93 519.98 A: wow 

521.87 523.05 A: that is cool 

522.69 528.63 B: have my little girl going down the street with her dog not going to bother anybody but he's not going to let anybody bother her 

528.54 531.31 A: yeah that's good um 

531.48 533.47 A: let's see where was 

534.55 542.64 A: toby was one time someone came into our backyard and no one was back there and she didn't know that um someone was coming 

542.69 544.14 A: and she 

544.25 545.29 A: she like 

545.47 555.25 A: she didn't bite them or anything but like she went after them which i thought was weird because she doesn't usually she's not usually like that she's always been a very very mellow dog 

555.28 556.27 A: um 

556.74 558.57 A: so i thought that was cool 

558.32 561.10 B: and what do you feed your current pets 

561.12 562.61 A: um 

563.48 565.58 A: [laughter] thor and kona 

566.22 568.33 A: gosh what is it called 

569.61 572.86 A: i think the the food is called 

573.81 576.17 A: nutri care i want to say 

576.53 580.39 A: i think that it's in um we buy it at sams club 

579.43 581.07 B: (( mm oh okay )) 

582.92 583.90 A: and then 

584.10 585.34 A: my parents feed 

585.46 588.84 A: our do- our other dog they feed her science diet 

589.05 596.50 B: mhm well that's go- well maybe you need to put them on that because thor ah what's the other one's name ah the lab's name 

595.94 597.09 A: toby 

596.56 599.95 B: toby's been living a long time [laughter] [laughter] [mn] 

597.89 599.41 A: (( yeah i know [laughter] ))
