0.51 2.56 A: hi my name's aaron 

0.54 1.93 B: hi my na- 

2.49 4.04 B: my name's matt 

3.63 6.90 A: matt sorry i talked over you there for a second i've never done one of these 

6.15 8.86 B: (( mm me neither [laughter] )) 

9.06 10.96 A: [laughter] fair enough so you have any pets 

11.19 13.03 B: (( no i don't do you )) 

12.26 20.58 A: i've i've got um actually a couple of stray cats that my girlfriend and i feed on our front porch and it's kind of become a neighborhood thing where 

20.95 32.57 A: some at some point somebody's been leaving food and water for the these cats on our porch as well so i don't know if it's the actual owners of these cats or what the deal is but it's ah it's 

30.77 31.90 B: [laughter] 

32.56 46.77 A: interesting to go out there and of course if they want everytime one of the cats gets sick or something you know or throws up or something like that my girlfriend's convinced that it's this other cat food that ah these people are feeding them because it's different than the cat food we feed them i don't know 

46.80 51.89 B: [laughter] so the there's just these pets that come up to your back door and 

47.64 48.87 A: something she does 

51.29 54.40 A: it's it's actually on our front porch it's ah 

53.81 55.29 B: oh your front porch 

54.96 61.45 A: yeah and they just they just come up i i don't know we moved into the house and her dad had been doing this for years apparently 

61.33 72.47 A: so they knew to come and we had to start feeding them [laughter] and i think i i don't know that all of them rely on us or if it's just an extra snack so they can get fat or what the deal is but 

61.59 62.69 B: [laughter] 

65.34 66.52 B: [laughter] 

71.36 72.57 B: oh wow 

72.65 87.56 A: yeah it's i don't know i mean i've kind of grown attached to them and they ah seem to like one of them particularly likes to come in the house and tries to climb in the ah we got an old house so they try to climb in the dock work and so forth and 

74.97 75.98 B: [laughter] 

86.12 87.28 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

88.64 94.12 A: just ah can make a mess and we're allergic to cats both of us so it's yeah [laughter] 

89.22 91.22 B: hm 

92.07 97.06 B: (( oh geeze [laughter] so you try and keep them outside )) 

96.71 107.04 A: yeah well that's that's the goal and i you know they it's they're cute and you know they they're friendly and they're cats and they're fun creatures and so forth so you want to have them inside but 

101.88 102.73 B: yeah 

107.38 114.01 A: i don't know eventually i get it gets old trying to keep them off the couch and so forth and yeah it's just 

111.70 112.87 B: [laughter] 

114.39 117.12 B: are are you both very allergic or 

116.48 124.53 A: no no not not nothing terrible eyes water a little bit and you know i guess if we probably rubbed our face on the cats we'd have problems but 

117.44 118.37 B: (( okay okay )) 

120.38 121.30 B: (( oh )) 

123.85 125.24 B: [laughter] 

124.71 128.06 A: keep petting with the hand seems to work have 

127.23 129.29 B: [laughter] yeah 

128.31 130.51 A: you ever had any pets at all 

130.33 132.95 B: um well see 

133.61 138.15 B: supposedly my whole family is allergic to ah dogs and cats 

138.02 139.18 A: oh well that's 

138.43 146.49 B: and so um never really had either um my mom's especially allergic to both those so 

146.46 159.94 B: um that never worked out um i think that maybe in the next couple of years i might test how allergic i am and maybe maybe get a cat or something because it's manageable [laughter] you don't have to 

157.20 166.62 A: yeah i think that i think there's a couple kinds of hairless cats or something like that i don't know that they're particularly attractive to look at but 

160.05 161.44 B: (( you don't have to walk it )) 

163.71 164.88 B: [laughter] 

166.93 169.06 B: probably not [laughter] 

168.07 170.46 A: [laughter] it might solve the allergy issue 

170.59 173.05 B: well i i tried to ah 

170.84 171.64 A: (( but ah )) 

173.38 174.62 B: (( i tried to )) 

174.85 178.29 B: ah have fish when i was younger and ah 

178.45 185.86 B: for some reason that we we would get fish for free like you know when they have like fairs and things like that and they have a fish in a bag yeah 

183.72 184.98 A: (( oh yeah yeah oh god )) 

185.99 198.98 B: so ah my brother and i got these fish when we were like eight years old and got the pet food and everything and we were going to go buy a tank the next day everything like that but the ah fish died overnight 

198.20 201.19 A: [laughter] 

200.24 212.43 B: [laughter] so i mean even when we tried to get fish a couple of times they would always die there's that it's probably not the best environment though to get a fish from you know [laughter] 

210.34 214.71 A: yeah you won them at the fair and you don't really know where they came from 

214.06 223.58 B: yeah i'm sure they kind of get freaked out by that point especially like going in the car and temperature change and things like that are probably not good for them and then i 

217.74 218.71 A: (( [laughter] )) 

219.41 220.79 A: [laughter] 

222.07 224.53 A: probably give them fish heart attacks 

224.53 227.86 B: yeah i tried to ah i i had like a 

228.34 241.19 B: like one of those digital fish on my computer but [laughter] [laughter] i don't i kind of i kind of wonder though what the point of really even having fish is anyway i mean they just kind of sit there you feed them and 

231.38 233.58 A: [laughter] 

238.18 238.80 A: (( yeah )) 

240.48 249.87 A: [mn] they they look pretty i mean it's like flowers but i don't know they all seem to die to me i've never known anybody that had a fish for more than like a month before it died so 

249.59 250.52 B: really 

250.39 256.09 A: yeah it's and i don't want to be fishing hell there's nothing there's nothing nice about fishing dead fish out of their 

255.95 257.27 B: [laughter] 

256.53 258.30 A: tank i don't imagine 

258.44 260.03 A: (( so ah )) 

259.50 261.79 B: no it's pretty unpleasant smell 

261.59 262.88 A: (( yeah it is )) 

262.16 270.65 B: picture it yeah you got to get lucky and have them die right away and get noticed [laughter] 

267.48 273.65 A: yeah yeah you can get get ones that will live for a long time and don't care if you don't feed them regularly i 

273.55 279.63 B: yeah well i yeah i can't even take care of plants though so i don't know whether i should ever get a pet 

279.66 281.60 B: [laughter] 

280.41 281.96 A: understand that 

281.91 288.94 B: so well ho- okay so supposedly we're supposed to now ah how much time do you spend with the cats 

288.63 296.78 A: oh that's a good that's a good thing i almost forgot about that ah i spend about ten minutes a day with the cats because i yeah i don't 

295.08 296.13 B: yeah 

297.11 300.63 A: care to hang out with them that much and i figured that they can 

299.42 300.83 B: [laughter] 

300.68 305.67 A: hang out with each other and play cat games or whatever it is cats do together but 

305.95 310.13 A: um they'll hopefully not make kittens that would not be good [laughter] but ah 

309.23 310.69 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

310.63 317.86 A: my girlfriend seems to when she's around she likes to ah spend twenty minutes or thirty minutes sitting on the porch petting the cat 

317.97 318.90 B: oh 

318.13 324.73 A: or one of them's old and it doesn't wash itself so well anymore so she takes a sponge out there and washes it which is 

322.09 322.93 B: (( well oh )) 

325.05 331.63 A: you know very endearing and nice and everything but not anything you could convince me to do despite 

330.51 331.56 B: yeah 

331.70 332.72 A: (( [mn] )) 

332.20 333.76 B: (( yeah )) 

333.97 343.29 B: well i really didn't want ah pets when i was younger honestly like a a cat or a dog because also because also ah 

340.80 341.76 A: yeah 

343.48 347.32 B: when i was young um i was at a friend's house and i 

347.39 351.86 B: walked into a dark room and i think i stepped on the cat's tail or something 

351.27 352.48 A: oh 

351.89 356.01 B: and it just like bit right into my my ankle and 

355.31 357.00 A: oh that's not good 

356.64 360.38 B: yeah it was just like why am i bleeding all of a sudden 

360.30 362.61 A: that's awful [mn] 

361.68 365.60 B: yeah it was really unpleasant so ah 

365.98 374.26 B: yeah i didn't definitely didn't want it at that point but then ah i stayed at a i visited new york a couple of years ago and i 

374.70 386.09 B: was at a bed and breakfast and the owner of the bed and which is weird because you wouldn't think they'd have bed and breakfasts in new york but they do and um the owner had a 

382.83 383.74 A: yeah 

386.35 393.15 B: had a couple of cats and ah they would just sit on me while i watched t._v. or read [laughter] and so 

391.57 394.57 A: (( oh [laughter] see i )) 

393.26 395.30 B: that was kind of pleasant 

394.70 401.10 A: see i wouldn't expect them in a bed and breakfast because i'd expect that they'd be you know really sensitive to people coming in being allergic and stuff but 

401.22 404.07 A: yeah maybe not maybe it adds that home feeling 

403.97 405.92 B: [laughter] 

404.62 406.10 A: to bed and breakfast 

406.02 415.28 B: well i had a feeling though this this lady wasn't exactly someone who really cared that much how positive your experience was i don't think 

413.53 415.52 A: [laughter] 

415.42 419.60 B: she got your money and you were there and that was the end of that [laughter] 

418.94 429.92 A: yeah yeah yeah it's i suppose i suppose depending on your financial situation you can afford to do things like that or you can't if you can you really don't care whether or not people come back 

425.47 427.31 B: [laughter] 

429.55 438.82 B: [laughter] well they had she would have orange juice in the refrigerator for the next morning and i wouldn't get up in time for for breakfast so ah 

438.75 446.16 B: i would come home at night and i would try and drink some of the orange juice and after two days she left me a note saying please don't drink the orange juice 

445.47 447.54 A: [laughter] 

447.58 449.17 A: (( [laughter] that's )) 

447.71 449.80 B: [laughter] it was so weird 

449.52 454.59 A: it's certainly an interesting experience i've never stayed anywhere like that we had ah we 

455.25 461.48 A: had a couple of cats when i was younger too that's why i think i'm more used to and comfortable around cats but 

459.85 460.82 B: (( yeah )) 

461.74 464.13 A: (( they ah you know one of them that )) 

464.21 472.97 A: died when i was like thirteen or something i just yeah oh and it was the one that i'd grown up with forever and then um so i kind of swore off 

466.82 467.73 B: oh 

470.33 471.24 B: (( i know )) 

472.99 486.10 A: pets after that point because i figure you get attached and then they die and you're not going to fi- you know it's going to be real hard for us to find a a pet that will outlive you and then you've got to think about the fact that the pet's going to be around you're going to be dead 

475.87 477.01 B: yeah 

482.18 483.23 B: oh yeah 

486.31 488.06 A: and who's going to take care of it 

486.93 487.74 B: yeah 

488.28 489.48 A: so ah 

488.29 490.32 B: yeah [laughter] 

490.02 494.92 A: i don't know if had had we not gotten this kind of inherited these ah 

494.63 495.73 B: [laughter] 

495.05 501.14 A: cats from her dad when her dad moved [laughter] i think you know we probably wouldn't have gotten any but ah 

500.98 502.08 B: [laughter] 

501.94 510.73 A: you know after after that cat died my parents got and my younger brother and sister went out and got two kittens and they ah 

511.19 518.27 A: have urinary issues where they don't like urinating anywhere but like on the rug and all around the house and 

516.32 517.53 B: [laughter] 

518.10 528.57 A: just awful on the beds too that was that's one of my mom's favorite experiences just laying down and having the ah cat on her feet and then feeling something wet and warm ooh that's exciting 

519.87 521.15 B: (( [laughter] )) 

528.64 531.70 B: [mn] [laughter] yeah 

528.96 529.98 A: but ah 

530.44 531.51 A: that was 

531.99 533.77 A: pretty bad 

532.59 533.31 B: i 

533.33 547.83 B: i think i'd rather ah spend my time and money on taking care of myself rather than [laughter] [laughter] something that's going to pee all over the place that's yeah [noise] not pleasant or 

538.80 541.01 A: (( exactly [laughter] )) 

545.21 546.23 A: yeah 

546.79 547.78 A: (( yeah it's )) 

549.04 552.18 B: a friend of mine ah is living with um 

552.31 555.17 B: someone at her school and um 

555.57 559.21 B: she her frie- her roommate has a um 

559.24 564.34 B: has a little dog that just jumps in the room like no matter what she does somehow 

563.66 564.46 A: (( [mn] )) 

564.23 569.58 B: manages to get the door open every time it seems like you almost have to wonder whether he 

566.41 567.26 A: (( no )) 

569.36 583.37 B: has opposable thumbs that he's hiding um to open the door something but he o- he'll come in there all the time and tear up her room and everything and she can't do that much about it because she's good friends with her roommate and it's not her dog you know [laughter] 

582.40 585.29 A: yeah yeah what are you going to do it's ah 

585.58 586.62 B: yeah 

586.04 588.28 A: one of those things i guess yeah the ah 

588.38 592.82 A: cats we got after that first one died we got a pair of them they were from the same litter and ah 

593.11 595.34 A: you know besides peeing eventually they ah 

595.45 599.89 A: one of them i forget which decided it was a good idea to chase f- people's feet it
