162.84 163.38 B: i have actually 

165.09 165.83 A: and they told me 

166.06 168.00 A: i had four miscarriages before 

168.33 170.55 A: you know i passed the fourth month with her 

171.00 171.91 B: oh wow 

171.73 173.56 A: they told me don't look forward to anything 

174.24 174.93 B: hm 

174.73 176.80 A: ah but she is hear and 

175.71 176.35 B: wow 

177.30 178.51 A: she is a miracle kid 

177.38 178.47 B: well that is one thing you could 

178.91 180.51 B: that is one thing you could change too 

181.38 184.23 B: and that uh not that you could do anything different about that but 

181.45 182.21 A: oh 

184.86 185.49 B: but um 

185.91 187.93 B: well you could always look into adopting 

188.81 189.88 B: that would be an option 

190.11 190.57 A: yeah 

190.89 192.42 A: uh we we've thought about that 

192.62 192.99 A: i just 

194.18 197.11 A: ah i'm not sure how i would feel about having more 

197.87 198.60 B: oh really 

198.01 199.41 A: yeah 

199.70 204.11 B: it well i am kind of spoiled with just my daughter and let me tell you she is a very easy kid 

204.77 206.15 A: oh that is good 

204.97 205.57 B: and 

205.85 206.14 B: and 

206.78 208.93 B: uh so i've been very very lucky so far 

209.55 214.07 B: that is one thing i would not change is her she was a little slow with walking and everything 

214.17 216.88 B: -cause she was close to eighteen months when she started walking 

217.10 217.76 A: oh wow 

217.49 218.16 B: but um 

219.07 220.63 B: other than that i probably wouldn't 

221.15 223.71 B: change a darn thing about her she is such a great kid 

224.39 224.84 A: this one 

224.43 224.88 B: (( )) 

225.03 226.53 A: this one took off at nine months 

227.47 228.59 B: oh my gosh you are kidding 

228.52 228.92 A: no 

229.67 232.89 A: took off walking she is very independent very independent 

229.72 230.42 B: wow 

233.44 235.35 A: she doesn't want my help with anything 

233.56 234.49 B: wow 

235.97 239.19 B: no my daughter here only started crawling at twelve and a half months 

239.60 241.98 A: oh this one well 

243.06 245.26 A: i gave her a lot of attention 

245.66 249.04 A: a lot and i made her my entire world 

250.41 252.15 A: and i'm very independent 

252.63 253.51 A: she probably 

252.88 253.36 B: okay 

254.35 256.10 A: yeah in fact i know she is just like me 

257.91 260.68 A: i don't want anybody's help and she doesn't want mommy's help 

261.23 262.28 A: until she realizes 

261.42 261.69 B: she 

262.53 266.26 A: you know she can't do it on her own and then she asks me for my help but 
266.61 267.16 B: yeah 

267.14 269.19 A: other than that she wants to do it on her own 

269.80 270.50 B: nah jes- 

270.65 272.63 B: jessica likes to um 

273.87 275.15 B: she likes to have 

276.13 279.90 B: her time you know where she wants you to get her things and 

280.31 283.14 B: but she is learning she can start doing things on her own now too 

281.78 284.01 A: that is good 

283.84 284.48 B: but um 

285.37 286.33 B: she is a good kid 

286.58 288.15 A: that might be one thing i would change 

288.77 289.45 A: for her to be a 

289.96 290.77 A: a baby 

290.97 292.19 A: mommy's 

291.34 291.70 B: yeah 

292.30 293.62 A: baby a little bit more 

294.49 295.53 B: now that is one thing she 

295.65 301.32 B: she is really good about going to other people she has never been like very clingy which is kind of a nice thing 

301.84 302.24 A: yeah 

303.00 303.74 B: and 

304.38 305.17 B: you know she is 

305.38 307.34 B: she has been such a good kid and 

307.90 310.32 B: everybody keeps telling me with my second one that 

310.91 312.58 B: is going to be the exact opposite of her 

312.66 313.38 A: it yeah 

314.53 315.44 A: that is what i've heard 

315.95 316.76 A: do you know what you are having 

317.75 318.26 B: a girl 

318.47 318.90 A: oh 

318.80 320.48 B: i'm ha- having another little girl 

320.59 324.81 A: well that is good well boys are supposed to be easier but 

322.13 323.00 B: so yeah 

325.20 325.91 A: they are 

325.50 327.01 B: oh i don't know about that 

327.74 329.99 B: i have fourteen nieces and nephews 

330.30 331.03 A: oh goodness 

330.81 334.84 B: and my one brother has two girls and then a boy 

335.06 338.03 B: and their boy is a handful let me tell you 

336.39 340.47 A: so 

339.41 340.23 B: he is just 

340.55 343.82 B: one big ball of energy he is only three 

343.77 344.45 A: oh goodness 

344.81 346.44 B: and it is just like oh my gosh 

347.14 349.32 B: he like bounces off the wall when you see him 

351.73 352.48 A: oh 

351.80 357.14 B: but yeah so are we supposed to be talking about anything else do you know or 

355.35 361.12 A: uh well we have to talk about this subject for about ten minutes and then they will tell us when to hang up 

359.26 359.75 B: okay 

361.70 362.27 B: yeah 

363.33 365.58 B: did you go to college or anything 

365.50 366.78 A: no i didn't 

368.58 369.97 A: really like school 

370.55 372.22 B: that pace is not for everybody 

372.76 375.99 B: my feeling with college is it is just to get you 

376.83 383.31 B: you know it just it depending if you know what you want to do to get you into that first job and let me tell you i learned more 

379.40 379.77 A: yeah 

384.55 386.88 B: in college being on my own 

387.24 389.76 B: than i did with actual textbook knowledge 

390.21 390.72 A: oh 

390.58 391.42 B: and uh 

392.55 396.21 B: and i wouldn't change that for anything -cause i really grew up when i was in college 

396.99 397.65 B: but um 

399.05 401.02 B: i i definitely would have changed my major though 

401.90 405.06 B: would have gone but now like i said i have always wanted to be a stay at home mom 

405.78 407.22 B: and that is what i'm doing right now 

408.23 409.38 B: and uh 

408.23 413.83 A: i i didn't always know i wanted the kids but i knew i didn't want to work 

411.24 412.01 B: oh 

414.31 416.44 A: i knew i wanted to be taken care of 

414.41 415.52 B: i don't bla- 

416.69 419.56 B: i don't blame you there 

418.23 418.95 A: come on sugar 

421.31 422.50 A: come on dog 

421.55 422.06 B: and i don't 

424.67 425.45 A: so 

426.01 427.71 B: i hear her (( )) in the background 

428.01 432.83 A: yeah but the the dog wanted to come inside and she is 

433.03 434.65 A: telling me let the dog in so 

434.60 436.09 B: what kind of dog do you have 

436.47 438.82 A: a mutt i

440.86 441.50 B: yeah 

441.87 442.53 B: same here 

443.34 444.46 B: same here we um 

445.19 445.90 B: i i 

446.18 451.43 B: this past summer i fostered some kittens from the humane league the our local humane league and 

452.02 453.64 B: and they were too young to be adopted 

453.96 457.68 B: and so they try to find people to to take them for -til they are adoptable 

457.79 458.21 A: mhm 

458.25 459.97 B: and i did that this summer 

460.17 461.24 A: (( )) 

460.83 464.02 B: and i i just have this love for animals and i you know i 

464.45 466.89 B: i think if i would ever go back to work i would probably look 

467.38 468.52 B: in to doing something 

469.31 470.16 B: with animals 

470.26 472.02 B: just because i love them so much and 

472.28 477.54 A: i think i agree with you i would probably you know get an internship if i ever did go 

477.67 478.31 A: to work 

478.97 480.81 A: again i like animals too 

479.97 480.40 B: yeah
