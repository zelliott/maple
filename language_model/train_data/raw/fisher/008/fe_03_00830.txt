34.14 36.24 A: okay so okay we can talk about this then 

36.75 39.12 B: i uh you want to go first go ahead 

38.88 40.16 A: um 

41.42 42.49 A: i guess uh 

43.87 44.40 A: oh 

44.84 46.24 A: if okay i i have a good one 

46.61 55.41 A: if i could go back in time i would uh go back to uh when i was applying for colleges and make sure that i applied to a broader range of schools 

55.96 57.86 B: hm hm larger range of schools 

57.61 58.08 A: yeah 

59.13 61.62 B: something for me would be probably 

61.85 64.34 B: car when i purchased my car uh 

64.83 69.34 B: if i were to go back in time i would want to maybe rethink what car i purchased and uh 

70.12 71.30 B: and get a different car 

71.50 75.17 B: i guess uh cause i didn't like the one i had i don't like the one i have right now 

75.18 75.74 A: what'd you get 

76.19 78.75 B: an audi i just i didn't i wanted a different model and 

79.25 80.18 A: which one did you get 

80.75 83.28 B: uh i got an a six and i wanted an s four 

83.98 86.86 A: why would you have gotten the nicer one if you wanted the less nice one 

87.30 91.67 B: i mean no i wanted i wanted the nicer one but i i didn't know much about cars back then so i mean 

92.17 93.88 B: i uh i really 

94.36 96.38 B: i wanted uh originally wanted an a four 

96.97 100.19 B: i looked at the a four then i saw that they the a six was a 

100.58 102.89 B: actually cheaper than the a four so they i 

102.52 103.41 A: that's really weird 

103.50 107.52 B: yeah i was ac- for the lease payments were much cheaper for the a six 

108.24 109.16 B: for some reason 

109.33 112.74 B: and so i got that one and i i didn't know anything about the a six 

113.32 115.39 B: and they two on two on stock 

115.53 116.70 B: a white and a gold one 

117.37 119.13 B: and since the guy like 

119.55 121.59 B: basically get the gold one it's a less 

121.79 122.17 B: gets 

122.27 123.17 B: dirty less 

123.91 125.03 B: so i chose that one and then 

125.59 131.96 B: as time progressed i reali- i became an enthusiast i i mean i love i love audis now but i just wish i had uh 

132.14 136.25 B: cho- chose the s four another er smaller car than the one i have right now 

136.00 137.00 A: how long have you already had it 

137.39 139.09 B: about a year and a half so i'm working 

139.36 140.97 B: uh working towards uh 

141.19 144.11 B: i want to maybe get in get the lease get out of the lease earlier you know

147.50 148.13 A: oh okay 

148.88 150.86 B: so i'm just trying to get out of the lease as quick as possible 

150.97 153.24 B: but i i'll probably if i get a job a new job

237.06 237.42 B: in your

262.20 264.04 B: yeah let me think i would uh 

264.89 266.04 B: if i went back in time 

267.40 269.32 B: i could prob- i would probably change uh 

269.86 272.14 B: the way i approach people you know like say uh 

272.73 274.19 B: how i talk to them or whatever 

274.43 277.57 B: said something to them or something like that i would probably change that because you know uh 

278.30 279.39 B: to my advantage it would be 

279.79 280.78 B: it would be helpful you know 

280.88 281.31 A: yeah 

281.95 283.24 B: um hm 

283.76 284.15 B: other 

283.88 285.83 A: how long are we supposed to talk for on this for 

285.66 286.38 B: i think ten minutes

287.55 288.32 B: yeah 

288.05 288.66 A: oh wow 

289.46 290.74 A: um 

291.26 292.66 A: let's see 

292.96 293.66 A: uh 

294.73 296.13 A: what else would i change 

296.15 299.47 B: i i have another thing ac- uh another thing i would change was 

301.19 301.96 B: uh not 

302.83 304.47 B: in a sense i would change uh 

305.44 306.06 B: my 

306.66 307.82 B: my habits like 

307.95 309.44 B: towards like something like a computer 

310.10 311.47 B: spending too much time on the computer 

311.80 313.79 A: oh you spend do you spend a lot of time at your computer 

314.07 319.85 B: not i mean it's it's it's it's really uh from from before i i mean it's not it's not a lot from before 

320.31 320.75 A: right 

320.38 322.26 B: before was much much more but uh 

322.57 326.22 B: yeah i would probably change i spend a lot of time on i i used to spend a lot of time on the computer 

327.02 327.48 A: yeah 

327.11 333.65 B: playing games and everything so that's one thing i would probably change instead of uh instead of doing gaming like uh online gaming and everything 

334.25 335.63 A: huh that's an interesting one 

335.76 336.07 B: huh 

336.34 337.33 A: that's an interesting one 

337.44 338.81 B: oh you're into online gaming 

338.90 340.31 A: uh no i'm not just at the 

340.45 340.96 A: (( )) 

341.14 342.15 A: see i don't know 

342.27 344.65 A: interesting thing to think that you'd want to go back and change 

344.78 347.22 B: yeah i mean cause it was you know it was a waste of time you know sitting there 

347.80 349.48 B: and playing games online or whatever 

349.61 350.09 A: yeah 

349.99 351.33 B: could have done more productive things than 

351.90 353.51 B: you know sit there and play games 

353.28 353.71 A: yeah 

354.61 357.43 A: i guess if i could if i could change something broader i would 

357.80 359.39 A: i would have been less uh 

360.11 362.67 A: i would have restricted myself less in high school 

363.30 364.04 A: i don't know i would have 

364.41 364.80 A: just 

365.03 365.94 A: partied more and 

366.42 368.31 A: been less self conscious you know 

368.44 373.61 B: yeah i i actually would change myself if i was back in high school i would if i went back in time 

373.75 374.36 B: i would have 

375.06 377.10 B: i would i would probably become more you know like uh 

378.39 380.98 B: i wasn't i wasn't i didn't like to in high school i was 

381.38 384.23 B: i guess the first year i was real active and then i slightly you know i sli- i 

385.28 387.05 B: didn't shut down i mean i didn't i started 

387.17 391.00 B: like uh limiting myself i was more quiet in classes and everything 

390.77 391.19 A: right 

391.17 393.15 B: school wasn't that important to me so i mean 

393.70 394.16 B: aw- 

394.75 397.15 B: i realized like the last year in senior year that i that 

397.60 400.40 B: you know colleges were coming up and i realized that damn my grades are not 

400.70 407.34 B: they're they're not good enough to get into the college i wanted to or i was i wanted to i wanted to get into to cal state uh california state uh 

407.53 408.21 B: northridge 

408.37 409.85 A: oh yeah i know exactly where that is 

409.04 409.44 B: and i 

409.95 410.77 B: yeah and i realized that 

411.25 414.10 B: i needed one i ne- i had not taken one math class 

414.71 417.77 B: i realized that i sh- if i had like taken one other math class and 

418.17 422.44 B: and other english class or something i would have got i would have been able to get into cal state northridge 

422.54 423.07 A: oh 

423.15 424.33 B: so i mean i wi- wish had 

424.45 426.81 B: taken i instead of doing that i took like an elective 

427.72 431.18 B: and i re- i i should have instead of that i should have you know i should have taken the 

432.14 433.92 B: those math classes and i would have been in uh 

434.17 436.44 B: instead of a community college right now i would have been in a thing 

436.75 438.91 A: uh is there a community college in beverly hills 

439.04 441.23 B: no there's no community college in beverly hills in santa monica
