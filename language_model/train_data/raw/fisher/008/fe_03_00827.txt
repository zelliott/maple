6.43 11.33 B: my name's tim it's nice to ah be talking to you in this strange way 

10.58 12.46 A: yeah [laugh] 

12.57 13.87 B: so um 

14.10 18.01 B: okay hypothetical going back in time and changing 

18.69 21.37 B: something you've done do you have anything off the top of your head 

21.34 28.49 A: um gosh no i'm trying to think of ah you know what i deeply regret and ah so forth 

28.77 35.44 B: actually you know ah i have ah my i do have one thing that ah pops into my head offhand which is the um 

31.88 32.35 A: mhm 

34.64 34.94 A: [breath] 

35.53 37.83 B: my choice of of colleges 

37.89 38.38 A: mhm 

38.59 43.82 B: um i gradu- you know i went i left for for you know i went away to college to ah at ten 

43.93 52.42 B: eleven years ago i guess and ah when i was in high school and i was looking you know looking into college i had no idea 

52.87 53.73 B: what i wanted 

53.98 54.50 B: you know what i me- 

54.73 63.07 B: didn't know if i wanted to go to a city school a you know a country school big small you know liberal conservative et cetera 

59.80 60.19 A: [breath] 

60.86 64.73 A: yeah i kind of felt the same way i didn't know what i wanted to do 

63.93 66.46 B: all i wanted to do is get get out of the house 

66.21 66.68 A: mhm 

66.94 71.64 B: um and so i just applied to a wide variety of schools for w- not 

71.81 81.48 B: a particularly clear reason and i wound up going to boston college which was really nice and all (( )) it was a beautiful campus but ah 

90.62 95.92 B: but i've often thought that if i could go back and do it again i would definitely do it differently 

96.41 102.51 B: and go for something that was probably a bit smaller and a bit more liberal 

102.90 107.10 B: um (( )) a little bit more a little less ah you know like a sports 

107.66 110.06 B: focused campus environment 

110.26 115.93 B: just because i didn't play sports or watch them so i felt a little left out ah that a part of the 

116.25 118.06 B: whole b. c. experience 

118.40 118.83 A: [breath] 

118.51 118.88 B: so 

119.51 120.49 B: so that's just one thought 

120.61 121.04 B: [breath] 

120.98 129.47 A: i'm at swarthmore right now and ah we sure aren't too big on sports here you know we got rid of our football team a few years ago 

129.48 129.88 B: yeah 

129.87 131.18 A: yeah that was a big hoopla 

131.31 132.03 A: um 

131.62 131.98 B: yeah 

133.42 137.44 A: yeah i kind of just applied to colleges like you actually i um 

137.73 140.54 A: you know i i went and applied to a bunch of 

140.66 149.98 A: schools just all over big schools little schools all types of schools and ah i finally decided i wanted to go to a liberal arts college and i also wanted to get 

150.42 152.20 A: ah quite some distance from home 

152.55 152.96 B: yeah 

155.00 156.99 A: so i came out here to pennsylvania 

157.73 158.25 B: i see 

157.75 163.38 A: and and sure enough one day i got a email about a linguistics data collection 

163.24 163.94 B: [laugh] 

164.08 164.75 A: [breath] 

164.81 166.49 B: [breath] well where are you originally from? 

166.57 167.53 A: minneapolis 

167.68 168.72 B: okay i see 

169.82 172.17 B: so any other things you would go back and do differently? 

172.36 173.89 B: so are you in college now then? 

173.83 178.37 A: yeah yeah yeah i'm just finishing up oh gosh maybe i'd 

176.45 177.04 B: i see 

178.64 181.22 A: get going on my grad school applications earlier 

181.50 182.41 B: [breath] 

182.59 183.04 A: [breath] 

183.33 185.92 B: [breath] i'm trying to think what else i would do differently 

186.31 187.91 B: i think that um 

189.19 191.27 B: i think if i could if (( )) if i 

191.50 192.72 B: thought about it 

192.85 195.12 B: a little bit more when i was younger i wish i had 

195.27 196.79 B: taken up an instrument 

197.08 197.99 B: or like 

198.08 202.95 B: i don't know i know i know everyone always says you could do it at any point in your life but um 

201.82 203.90 A: yeah it's a lot easier when you're younger though 

204.03 205.69 B: yeah i mean i i just 

204.18 205.35 A: [breath] 

206.06 211.12 B: i i i would like it would be great if i could say i've been playing the guitar for fifteen years 

206.34 207.94 A: [breath] 

210.82 211.40 A: yeah 

211.34 216.65 B: but i don't really feel like taking it up now because frankly i barely have enough time between work and you know i'm i 

216.88 221.47 B: go to grad school in the evenings and i don't have enough time to pick up a new hobby 

221.17 225.35 A: yeah i kind of wish i had kept playing the piano and flute when i 

225.46 226.67 A: came to college here 

226.97 231.72 A: i you know i still have them but i and i can still play and i do sometimes but ah 

227.12 227.60 B: yeah 

232.83 233.59 A: (( should have you know )) 

233.69 235.13 A: taken lessons or something 

235.35 239.18 B: yeah you know in a similar vein i think i would ah 

235.64 236.38 A: once i got here 

239.61 242.51 B: i wish [breath] okay here's one i wish i had taken 

241.04 241.48 A: uh-huh 

256.56 257.09 A: (( )) 

257.81 260.57 B: and um i took french because of um 

260.77 262.38 B: because of a panteen commercial 

262.61 264.03 A: [laugh] 

262.70 263.03 B: (( )) 

263.70 271.08 B: a woman with a really sexy french accent so i took french but i really 

271.63 275.12 B: i i seem to encounter spanish quite a bit more often you know 

274.80 275.22 A: mhm 

275.55 284.63 B: um (( )) i mean i'm living in the northeast so it's not even all that um you know like hispanic an area per se but it seems like there's so much more of an application to it 

284.92 285.72 B: you know 

299.11 303.57 B: for a ah the few times i've been to france i've been able to you know understand enough 

304.00 306.34 B: or that's actually being generous 

305.57 307.75 A: [laugh] 

315.62 318.58 B: in thing i read in movies and stuff like that 

318.15 318.67 A: mhm 

318.76 320.58 B: so in music particularly 

320.80 329.62 A: yeah i took i took spanish when i had the same choice in ah about ninth grade and i'm glad i did because it does it is 

329.74 332.56 A: useful um but 

332.71 340.92 A: but i kind of wish i had done french back then because the french teacher was so much better than the lousy spanish teachers we had 

341.11 341.94 B: yeah yeah 

342.45 352.29 B: [breath] well do you have speaking of things that you could go back and change is there anyone that you ah that you broke up with yourself that you would ah that in retrospect that you think was a bad idea 

352.78 356.83 A: oh maybe i mean that's all stuff from 

356.73 357.49 B: [laugh] 

357.16 359.42 A: pretty early high school and 

359.72 363.50 A: i don't think that that would have done much anyways so 

364.10 366.88 A: so no that was all fun but no regrets there 

367.27 367.76 B: yeah 

368.53 370.23 B: one trying to think what else i would 

370.69 377.15 B: do differently okay here's another thing i spent my junior year in college um 

377.36 379.07 B: studying abroad in england 

379.80 382.83 B: and ah i definitely traveled a lot while i was there 

383.29 389.74 B: but it seemed like i i mean i was in london so there was tons to do you know in in the city so i really wish that i um 

386.69 388.03 A: yeah 

390.04 394.45 B: traveled more in england itself i spent a lot of time traveling around the rest of europe 

394.78 396.68 B: um but i wish i had spent like 

394.84 395.15 A: hm 

396.91 401.70 B: more time because now now i've got you know i work i've got 

401.91 403.68 B: two weeks of vacation a year 

404.42 410.25 B: um and you know i can't can't y- you can't obviously travel as much as i could while i was 

410.78 413.23 B: ah you know in school there which you know 

420.21 425.43 B: really unfortunate because um i'm half irish and i've got distant relations there 

425.73 428.00 B: i never made the effort to go over there which is um 

428.18 430.07 B: you know just too bad (( )) 

430.35 436.45 B: start to realize i've got a lot of things i would have changed in my life but nothing major i guess 

436.43 437.82 A: yeah it's 

438.25 442.47 A: th- probably good that you can't think of anything too big 

442.46 443.35 B: yeah yeah 

443.92 447.95 B: [breath] yeah no i think i've made some ah i think i've made so good decisions when i heard that ah 

448.04 453.19 B: you know the hypothetical situation about time travel is when i first got on the phone and (( )) said you know 

453.02 453.45 A: mhm 

453.39 459.59 B: hypothetical situation time travel and i was thinking i would ask like if you could got back in any period in time 

459.83 464.86 B: or forward you know like which would you choose e because that seems like a more interesting topic to me 

464.97 469.22 A: oh i i would love to go forward just to see how it all turns out 

467.43 468.93 B: i definitely would too 

469.74 471.08 B: yeah i'd love to jump ahead maybe like 

471.47 473.21 B: fifty or a hundred years or so 

473.57 475.71 B: just to see what you know what life is like 

476.24 478.37 B: or how messed up it would be 

478.07 480.00 A: yeah hopefully not so bad 

480.28 486.45 B: see the only problem there is that i think if you jump ahead and you see things that you don't like then you you know just having the knowledge of it 

487.09 488.07 B: might be 

489.27 490.99 B: just you know might not be a good thing 

490.98 492.82 A: yeah it might really depress you 

492.98 501.38 B: yeah yeah although it wouldn't be ah it would be that bad to maybe go a year ahead in time and see what stocks are looking good and 

501.07 501.55 A: mhm 

501.98 504.23 B: coming back and ah you know 

504.53 506.56 B: making some ah purchases accordingly 

506.68 509.30 A: pick the winners we're so short 

506.70 507.26 B: try to make a 

507.93 508.83 B: yeah 

509.41 511.15 B: yeah oh exactly 

511.93 515.79 B: so let's see any other things you'd go back and change? 

519.84 521.13 A: [breath] 

522.84 524.20 A: well i would have liked to have 

524.74 527.51 A: traveled more but i'll get enough chances to do that 

527.99 528.60 B: [breath] 

528.70 530.62 B: [breath] you just finishing up your senior year now 

530.60 531.16 A: yeah

537.09 537.68 B: oh okay 

538.74 542.16 B: [breath] well it's a lot easier than looking for a job at the moment 

541.39 542.44 A: yeah 

542.99 543.59 A: yup 

543.76 544.86 A: i know that well

584.24 585.57 B: hm did
