14.57 16.99 B: oh i could tell that too [laughter] 

15.80 18.79 A: (( [laughter] yeah down near new orleans [laughter] )) 

17.49 20.31 B: h- have you ever done these calls before 

19.71 21.99 A: no this is the first one have you 

21.59 23.99 B: no it's it's my first too 

23.55 26.70 A: okay well good do you watch reality t._v. 

26.15 29.24 B: yes i'm a sucker for reality t._v. 

28.39 37.13 A: oh okay well good one of us will know something about it [laughter] well i've watched a little bit but i don't watch a lot of t._v. anyway so 

31.41 33.35 B: you haven't watched any of 'em 

36.26 37.19 B: (( ahah )) 

37.29 42.13 A: so i really don't know all that much about very many i remember the first survivor 

41.87 47.74 B: yes that's the one my sister in law used to watch and she'd tell me all about it every week 

44.92 45.82 A: (( ahah )) 

47.31 59.38 A: right i missed the beginning of it too and it was my sister in law that told me too [laughter] ahah [mn] oh yeah she was a sucker for it she was just talking about it all of the time so i caught some of the end 

51.02 53.65 B: oh that's so funny and [laughter] 

59.15 62.39 B: well what happened was then the the following year 

62.44 65.56 B: [lipsmack] she got me into starting to watch the first one 

65.34 66.24 A: (( ahah )) 

65.61 72.16 B: so i i definitely i followed it every week and we had something to talk about and it was funny 

68.55 69.48 A: right 

70.69 80.52 A: right yeah [lipsmack] they are funny i mean it's something that you kn- like the question says why do you think they're so popular i i don't know wh- why are they [mn] 

72.20 73.05 B: yeah 

80.22 81.66 B: (( [noise] [noise] well i )) 

81.74 86.02 B: i guess because it's non scripted t._v. that we're watching 

86.21 87.01 B: and 

86.22 94.49 A: i think it's i think it's because the scripted t._v.'s gotten so stupid [laughter] you know i was watching the ah one of the sitcoms the other night 

89.70 91.24 B: maybe that's it 

94.58 96.70 A: [lipsmack] and people don't act like that 

96.52 98.60 B: no yeah you're right 

97.28 108.46 A: you know they were ju- it was it was my big fat greek wife but i mean it was everything was a little one liner and people that the little laugh track would go and i didn't think it was funny and people don't really act that way so 

108.32 113.46 A: [mn] [lipsmack] i guess people have gone to reality t._v. because that's really how people act [laughter] 

112.46 118.74 B: yeah i would have liked to try to watch that but i was probably watching some other reality tv [laughter] [cough] 

118.03 121.19 A: well what are they now which ones are on 

120.80 123.81 B: well there's still survivor which i started watching 

122.58 123.36 A: (( ahah )) 

123.44 124.43 A: mhm 

124.02 126.76 B: and then i'm sure you've heard about joe millionaire 

126.62 131.02 A: right i watched the a few of those what happened when they found out he wasn't a millionaire 

130.77 135.90 B: well that's [noise] that's where it was funny [noise] that's why we watched it all season 

134.70 140.97 A: right well i i watched enough to f- to know that i wanted to watch that one and i missed it [laughter] 

140.28 148.19 B: well they were all pretty surprised to hear that but in the end he ended up getting a half a million dollars anyway which was a surprise to him 

142.68 143.52 A: (( ahah )) 

147.76 150.13 A: oh he didn't know he was gonna get that 

149.57 160.24 B: no and the girl he picked but from what i hear now from the news they're not together anyway so it wasn't to get married or to get engaged or any of that so it was 

155.21 155.92 A: (( [mn] )) 

157.45 159.28 A: right right 

159.38 164.43 A: i saw her on something else and she looked pretty neat i mean she looked like she was pretty down to earth 

163.99 169.12 B: yeah i think that's why he liked her you know he picked her because if he [noise] 

165.67 166.52 A: (( ahah )) 

168.14 168.70 A: (( [mn] )) 

169.35 172.93 B: if he was a millionaire she wouldn't be going after him for his money 

172.62 178.20 A: right and and he was pretty down to earth obviously because [laughter] he had to be [laughter] 

173.30 174.06 B: so 

176.12 179.95 B: [laughter] yeah a construction worker i would guess so 

178.79 180.73 A: yeah right 

179.99 189.88 B: but what happened was though they both live on different coasts and they're not going to get together but it was fun to watch but there are some out there now that are 

185.48 187.35 A: right right 

189.89 194.23 B: absolutely ridiculous like married by america i tried 

191.30 192.35 A: right 

193.39 200.57 A: now i saw the first maybe five minutes of that and i went yow right and and switched off i mean that was silly [lipsmack] 

200.17 203.88 B: now there's something with the same format american 

202.85 206.29 A: those people really are going to be married or [mn] 

205.48 208.85 B: i suppose or they're gonna supposedly live together 

208.76 209.79 A: yeah 

209.21 214.73 B: and see if they wanna get married but i don't think i'm giving that one another chance um 

210.93 211.82 A: right 

213.14 214.34 A: (( right [mn] [mn] )) 

214.90 220.82 B: there's something with the same format like the american idol that i enjoy because it's people singing 

220.54 221.41 A: right 

221.16 224.86 B: and the judges tell them what they think and they eliminate them 

223.44 224.32 A: right 

224.51 233.43 A: right there's some talent to that [mn] my husband's a recording engineer and [mn] in the very beginning of those when they had all the people that were so terrible coming on singing 

233.19 233.96 B: (( ahah )) 

233.26 246.62 A: and they didn't know they were so terrible i mean they really thought they were good [mn] he could really relate to that because he had people come in his studio to record [mn] that were horrible and i mean they would listen to themselves and still think they were good 

235.26 236.39 B: [laughter] 

242.46 243.48 B: oh so 

246.23 251.09 B: oh my so i thought this was maybe an act but they are that bad 

248.85 259.90 A: no he says there are people like that and i say well you know those people have obviously never heard themselves like on tape and steve says no he has heard people he's recorded them and played it back to them and they still think it's good 

259.44 260.55 B: [laughter] 

260.27 264.23 A: (( so [laughter] he goes their ear's just wrong )) 

262.13 263.40 B: well it's pretty 

263.76 266.32 B: it's pretty interesting to watch that but i guess 

265.39 266.77 A: mhm 

266.38 273.60 B: i guess they're trying to follow the same format with three judges with that married by america and it just to me it was terrible 

269.74 270.55 A: right 

273.29 274.52 A: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

273.65 276.46 B: yeah i found no reason to want to watch it again 

276.27 277.20 A: right 

276.49 279.32 B: but i am watching [mn] all the others 

277.84 285.47 A: i was thinking yeah i was thinking that that might if they had taken the format like the old dating game those were a kick you know 

285.20 286.59 B: right 

285.23 295.42 A: and they i saw a um a special about that the other day and all the celebrities that had started out there before anyone knew who they were [mn] and that was pretty funny you know when you saw 

294.42 298.03 B: yeah and the newlywed game that used to be funny 

297.04 303.64 A: yeah yeah of course if those were on now they wouldn't go over we're way too sophisticated for that [mn] 

301.05 302.02 B: well that's 

303.04 306.70 B: i read an article about reality t._v. just today 

306.86 310.28 B: and it's funny that i should get this subject to talk to you about 

309.34 310.76 A: [laughter] really 

310.39 314.65 B: but they said they were going to try to bring back the dating game and the newly g- the newlywed game 

314.28 315.37 A: oh really 

314.87 319.61 B: but they were gonna they were gonna have to update them but they were gonna try to keep the same 

317.28 318.59 A: oh sure they are 

320.29 322.63 B: same format in a way 

320.95 321.95 A: yeah 

322.07 323.00 A: yeah 

322.84 323.80 B: so 

323.35 329.49 A: [mn] well they've stolen that format for so many other game shows it's i mean i was i saw one that [lipsmack] 

326.83 328.19 B: yeah 

330.09 341.16 A: let's see street smarts i think [mn] that's a lot like some of the ones that i you know they have three people on the ah street and they ask them a question and you have to choose which one you think is gonna be right 

340.91 342.99 B: oh that sounds interesting 

341.50 352.12 A: it's a yeah it's that one's not i actually kinda get a kick out of that one because it's it's almost like reality t._v. in that they just find people in the street [mn] and talk to 'em 

351.56 352.83 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

352.23 365.35 A: and so there's nothing scripted about their answers the only problem with it is that some of these people are really pretty stupid and i i feel sorry for 'em when they put that on national t._v. i mean they're asking 'em something like [mn] you know i don't know 

357.62 359.04 B: [laughter] 

365.44 371.08 A: wh- just some question about you know where is north dakota or whatever and these people don't know [laughter] 

369.74 370.94 B: [laughter] 

371.24 373.41 B: yeah so you feel sorry for them 

372.81 379.82 A: you do but they're they kind of jive their answers sometimes and like they know they don't know and [laughter] it's okay [mn] 

378.14 383.95 B: yeah and i guess there's there's certain i don't know if you would call 'em reality t._v. 

384.12 387.98 B: exactly but things like candid camera i like those 

386.75 388.87 A: right right [mn] 

388.22 391.72 B: you know where they or videotapes like real t._v. or 

391.31 392.18 A: right 

391.76 394.18 B: funniest videos those are kind of funny 

393.57 395.58 A: exactly exactly 

394.46 398.88 B: and again it's unscripted you know i don't care for the whole s- 

396.41 397.29 A: (( ahah )) 

398.09 401.51 A: some of those the funniest videos are the funniest the pets' one 

401.38 403.55 A: i can turn those on like 

402.97 403.71 B: (( [noise] )) 

403.41 416.48 A: in the middle of the night i wake up and i can't go back to sleep no sound or anything and just watch it and that's funny because it's real people whereas if i turned on a t._v. show you'd have to listen to the sound because you have no idea what's really going on [laughter] 

410.14 411.16 B: right 

415.74 417.69 B: yeah you have to follow it 

416.94 419.39 A: you have to follow a a story line 

419.03 420.47 B: yeah that's right 

419.47 424.47 A: and maybe that's the other thing about the reality t._v. there's i mean there's not really a story line 

424.40 425.95 B: that's it maybe 

425.09 433.31 A: [lipsmack] although i am really curious since you've watched all the survivors what's the deal with the tribes why do they feel like they have to get in tribes [lipsmack] 

432.94 438.04 B: i that i don't know but this this year they did men versus women 

438.15 439.25 A: yeah 

438.59 444.18 B: and they decided that might work i i missed maybe one or two of these 

441.28 442.27 A: [mn] 

443.61 444.55 A: (( ahah )) 

444.28 445.43 B: um 

444.92 447.56 A: well i saw the wo- the first woman that 

447.36 449.40 A: that was voted off or whatever 

449.26 462.53 A: [cough] on letterman [mn] and she said that was a really stupid idea [laughter] because men are just naturally stronger than women so where they were that was a real advantage plus the women apparently got really bitchy toward each other [laughter] so 

453.19 454.94 B: maybe maybe it was 

461.64 465.01 B: yeah but the women were winning that's the whole thing 

463.33 464.42 A: were they 

464.56 466.31 A: ah okay [mn] 

465.37 468.32 B: unexpectedly they were winning so 

467.53 473.83 A: well this woman sounded like she had some sour grapes going too being the first one asked to leave you know 

471.02 471.96 B: (( i )) 

473.35 479.42 B: think that's a lot of what america when people want to watch these shows do they wanna see conflict 

479.29 480.11 A: yeah 

479.68 485.72 B: so there was there was another one high school reunion i vowed this year i'm gonna try them all so 

484.80 487.87 A: i didn't see high i did not hear about high school reunion 

487.68 492.11 B: [cough] well that one again they took like several i don't know how many ten people 

492.46 498.57 B: who graduated ten years ago threw 'em in a house together so naturally some of the old 

496.42 497.60 A: oh lord 

498.07 498.67 A: (( [cough] )) 

498.87 505.00 B: um [lipsmack] you know rivalry comes out so i guess people wanna just watch this i don't know 

501.56 502.48 A: sure 

503.86 508.24 A: yeah i had kinda forgotten about the ones they threw in houses together and made 'em stay 

507.37 515.38 B: yeah i mean i never watched the others like big brother or any of those there's there's only so much time there seem to be so many of 'em these days 

511.22 512.16 A: yeah 

514.46 519.21 A: there are you know now that you're saying it and there's the one where they doing that road race thing 

518.81 522.45 B: that was interesting amazing race is that what you're talking about 

520.76 521.68 A: (( ahah )) 

521.71 522.64 A: (( ahah )) 

522.47 530.28 B: now that was nice because they had to go around the world catch planes cla- catch trains and get to a destination before 

526.09 527.05 A: right 

527.12 528.21 A: right 

529.13 533.72 A: right they had something to do there was a reason for them to be together to do something [noise] 

533.09 536.28 B: right that was kind of like a game just spread out 

533.99 534.78 A: (( and )) 

535.03 542.53 A: yeah that was the one that i saw and one time i think they were in rome or something and i was going ooh i wanna get picked for this one [laughter] i wanna go around the world 

539.88 545.26 B: yeah yeah it looked like at least they get to see a lot of different things you know 

543.94 545.35 A: exactly 

545.37 548.65 B: so it it but it seems to me there is just 

548.78 551.53 A: well i heard about one that um 

551.77 562.41 A: th- i don't know that it's even gonna air i can't remember what network it was supposed to be sci fi i think or something like that anyway that was gonna do a reality show that it was supposed to scare you to death 

562.03 563.19 B: oh boy 

562.75 574.17 A: and that was the name of it or something well they took a person out in on a car ride in the desert [lipsmack] and they faked like they had car trouble and they got out and were attacked by aliens [mn] 

566.31 566.94 B: [laughter] 

573.75 577.40 B: oh i think i saw some some little clip of that [laughter] 

576.15 580.71 A: yeah well she sued 'em because she had like a seizure or something 

580.16 582.08 B: oh no 

581.47 587.04 A: oh no it wasn't a seizure that's the the people in the airplane she had anyway she had some kind of a problem you know 

586.83 587.88 B: yeah 

587.16 594.98 A: [lipsmack] but she was running or he i don't even know if it was a he or a she [mn] was running away thinking that these really were aliens 

594.51 596.48 B: oh now come on [laughter] 

595.44 596.90 A: and they i mean 

597.16 599.89 A: you know you kinda gotta stop but the person who was doing
