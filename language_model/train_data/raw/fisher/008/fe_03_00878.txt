2.73 7.25 B: yeah i guess i enjoy going to movies for the most part um i've gotten a lot more 

7.77 11.10 B: select about it 'cause the ticket prices keep going up but i would 

11.72 13.97 B: say i do enjoy [mn] going to the movies 

13.99 14.86 A: (( um )) 

15.29 18.82 A: i do but the ticket price is a problem 

18.40 19.44 B: yeah 

18.84 21.90 A: i don't have a job or anything and i am a student 

21.39 22.47 B: (( right [mn] )) 

22.01 26.36 A: so i definitely do prefer watching movies at my house 

26.44 30.96 B: yeah i definitely would have that preference though watching at home [laughter] yeah 

29.16 30.91 A: (( i'd say [laughter] yeah [laughter] )) 

30.95 32.52 A: and um 

32.93 35.97 A: actually i find it cheaper just to buy movies 

35.90 37.69 B: certainly yeah 

37.44 47.03 A: um especially since there are lots of dis- discount sites on the web and stuff and you can probably buy a movie for the same price that you can go to the movies for 

41.78 42.86 B: mhm 

46.58 48.26 B: yes [laughter] 

47.47 50.34 A: so that's what i prefer to do [laughter] 

49.42 50.79 B: yeah 

51.21 54.45 A: [laughter] and what was the other question [mn] 

54.49 55.51 B: (( i think that was )) 

54.74 57.15 A: well how often do you go to the movies 

56.93 58.09 B: (( ah probably )) 

59.11 62.68 B: i guess on the average once a month but i mean there are months when i don't go [mn] 

62.66 67.99 A: same here i've probably gone about two times in the last six months 

67.57 69.19 B: yeah 

68.36 71.54 A: so definitely not often [laughter] 

70.76 72.23 B: (( right right [mn] )) 

72.58 82.57 A: i used to go a lot more especially a few summers ago i'd go to a movie probably each day my friend worked in a movie theater 

74.31 75.53 B: mhm 

82.22 84.20 B: (( oh right yeah )) 

83.44 84.81 A: it was free 

85.13 85.81 A: (( [mn] )) 

85.49 87.85 B: movies are better in the summer anyway so 

87.44 88.72 A: that's true 

88.20 89.49 B: yeah 

89.66 92.89 A: so yeah that's what i did every day [mn] 

92.36 93.93 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

93.95 96.21 A: [mn] and um 

96.34 98.66 A: i don't really rent many movies 

99.07 102.66 A: i don't see any point since i can buy them 

99.09 100.42 B: yeah 

100.68 101.98 B: right 

102.42 103.24 B: (( right )) 

105.83 107.52 A: and what was the other question 

108.04 109.28 B: um 

110.61 111.21 B: (( i )) 

111.46 113.99 B: (( gue- i guess what was the last movie you went to )) 

115.10 116.97 B: and did you enjoy it [laughter] 

116.38 121.22 A: um [mn] the last one i went to was my big fat greek wedding 

120.98 122.05 B: (( oh yeah )) 

121.46 124.01 A: that was an excellent movie 

123.67 125.10 B: yeah 

124.48 125.82 A: (( very funny )) 

126.16 127.32 A: and

130.67 131.85 B: mhm 

131.24 138.76 A: and there were people of all age ranges and genders and [mn] everyone enjoyed it 

139.01 140.38 B: (( right )) 

139.74 141.38 A: which one did you go to 

140.97 142.66 B: ah it was a 

143.28 147.30 B: movie called may um it was sort of like a black comedy 

147.65 149.27 A: oh those are always good oh 

148.60 153.78 B: m yeah it was pretty fun and it was a pretty big crowd it was part of a horror film festival so it was 

154.47 158.72 B: a little bit different than your usual movie crowd but um yeah it was fun 

157.31 158.14 A: yeah 

159.14 160.49 A: well that's cool 

160.89 162.42 A: what was that one about 

162.62 164.99 B: [mn] ah it's just about this um 

166.25 169.82 B: this woman when she was a little kid her mother told her if you can't 

170.12 173.60 B: um make if you can't find new friends make one 

174.05 178.63 B: and so she killed a bunch of people and made the parts together [laughter] 

176.91 177.71 A: (( [mn] )) 

178.67 179.80 B: that was [mn] 

180.37 183.19 A: very interesting that's called 

181.50 185.63 B: yeah it it was a little better than my description but that's the basic 

185.76 187.72 B: root of the plot [laughter] 

187.66 190.25 A: [mn] that was called may or 

189.51 191.93 B: yeah m. a. y. that was her name [mn] 

192.17 196.47 A: ah i think i will actually check that out i love black comedies so 

194.78 196.03 B: (( [mn] oh yeah )) 

197.13 198.61 A: definitely 

197.47 200.11 B: (( yeah )) 

199.53 205.16 A: and that's actually basically what i watch that's basically what i buy 

202.56 203.45 B: right 

204.62 207.83 B: mhm 

206.57 210.95 A: and i've gotten a lot lately probably in the last month 

211.26 213.71 A: since i do choose to buy movies 

213.75 215.57 A: so i try to buy about one a week 

215.55 218.45 B: oh oh that's pretty frequent yeah [laughter] 

218.12 222.05 A: (( [mn] yeah [laughter] i know i've got an addiction to dvds )) 

221.89 226.88 B: oh yeah you can do that netflix thing now where you they just deliver it to you and you send it back you know 

225.53 226.62 A: oh yeah 

226.78 227.74 A: that's true 

227.81 229.37 B: (( yeah )) 

228.99 232.70 A: but i don't like that that much 'cause i can't keep it 

232.49 234.34 B: yeah that's true [laughter] 

233.35 236.37 A: [laughter] and there's the responsibility there 

235.77 236.87 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

238.02 239.60 A: [mn] [mn] um 

240.82 244.84 A: what was the movie you saw before [mn] that last one [mn] 

246.05 248.23 B: (( wow i can't even remember um )) 

250.60 251.77 B: (( um i )) 

253.43 258.83 B: guess i went to see lord of the rings i'm not a huge fan of that but it was all right yeah [mn] 

258.81 262.71 A: yeah i didn't see that one i fell asleep during the first one 

262.35 265.04 B: (( yeah i did too [laughter] )) 

263.30 264.32 A: [laughter] 

264.37 269.57 A: well i figured i probably shouldn't especially since i heard it was longer than the first one mm 

269.49 273.70 B: yeah it did seem a little longer but i think there was a little more action though so 

274.09 279.96 A: i might eventually see it but [mn] definitely wasn't running to the theater for that 

275.72 277.07 B: yeah 

279.36 280.82 B: yeah yeah it wasn't 

282.21 286.28 A: [mn] and probably the last one i saw at the theater 

286.52 291.70 A: [mn] before my big fat greek wedding [lipsmack] was bowling for columbine 

291.85 294.35 B: [laughter] oh yeah i meant to go see that but it only 

294.61 297.72 B: played for a few weeks here but you know never got around to it [laughter] 

296.41 297.24 A: oh 

298.06 301.12 A: well we have lots of independent movie theaters here 

300.91 301.90 B: yeah where do you live 

301.73 303.81 A: i live in cleveland ohio 

303.18 307.30 B: oh yeah yeah we have a few but they kind of come and go quickly [mn] 

306.94 307.99 A: oh 

307.65 308.26 B: (( yeah )) 

308.01 315.98 A: [mn] [mn] well that one actually did play for many many weeks here so when it's on video i definitely suggest it 

312.38 313.57 B: (( oh well )) 

315.77 318.37 B: yeah yeah i've read some good reviews of it yeah 

318.05 325.48 A: yeah definitely good makes you think a lot and makes you cry it doesn't matter who you are you will cry [mn] 

320.47 321.41 B: mhm 

321.82 322.73 B: oh 

324.05 324.75 B: (( well )) 

324.82 326.89 B: (( right )) 

326.05 329.00 A: [laughter] so expect that 

327.74 328.96 B: (( [laughter] okay )) 

329.83 331.73 A: [mn] and um 

332.18 338.98 A: trying to think of what other movies i've seen in the theater [mn] i don't know if i can even think of any [mn] 

338.91 339.56 B: yeah 

341.78 344.83 A: no idea um 

344.85 350.38 A: there's a movie actually i do want to rent though 'cause it's way too expensive to buy right now um 

350.48 353.67 A: who is cletis tout have you heard of that one 

354.27 356.98 B: yeah i've heard of that what is that i've heard of that though 

356.58 365.17 A: um it's got christian slater in it and i think that he runs away from jail [mn] and 

359.35 360.25 B: okay 

365.32 370.31 A: takes on a new identity [mn] and i'm not quite sure what else 

369.61 370.70 B: (( oh okay )) 

370.57 371.28 A: but 

371.44 374.56 A: it seems interesting from what i've heard 

372.63 373.82 B: mhm 

375.15 378.82 A: [mn] and now dreams are actually starting to enter in 

378.84 383.80 A: like movies are starting to enter into my dreams and [mn] i think i had a dream about it last night [laughter] 

382.99 384.58 B: right [laughter] 

383.94 390.68 A: and other dreams about movies and i was in a lot of movies and it was very strange so it's funny that i got this topic 

389.96 392.16 B: [laughter] yeah 

391.53 395.62 A: (( [laughter] so now i have to see it since i dreamed about it )) 

394.34 397.06 B: yeah since you dreamed about it you have to see it 

396.32 399.05 A: [laughter] yes i think it's a definite sign 

398.87 400.06 B: (( [laughter] )) 

400.27 403.61 A: [mn] but i haven't i've only seen it [lipsmack] 

403.62 407.57 A: at one rental place i haven't seen it anywhere to buy 

407.13 408.65 B: yeah 

407.78 410.68 A: i don't know if its independent or what it is 

410.96 413.51 B: i think it is i could be wrong but it 

413.65 415.65 B: it seemed like it was mm 

414.94 421.20 A: yeah probably and i like independent films more rather than the hollywood films 

418.79 421.31 B: (( yeah i do too yeah )) 

421.79 425.31 B: (( yeah )) 

424.61 427.75 A: and what other movies do you like

433.91 435.40 B: um 

435.44 437.90 B: [lipsmack] i can't really narrow down one genre but 

437.95 443.27 B: just independent using that umbrella term for [laughter] what i enjoy more 

441.29 442.47 A: yeah 

443.22 450.61 A: [mn] in movies ah especially with dark comedies they don't get a lot of rave reviews and you don't really hear about them 

446.93 447.57 B: (( mm )) 

450.15 451.71 B: yeah that's true 

451.10 457.22 A: but they're really good 'cause there's another movie love and a forty five have you heard of that one

489.94 492.47 B: just no budget movies [laughter] 

491.74 493.75 A: (( [mn] those are the best ))
