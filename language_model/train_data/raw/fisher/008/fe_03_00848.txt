0.71 2.03 A: hi i'm danny how are you doing 

2.32 4.28 B: hey this is rich doing good 

5.95 7.03 B: so 

7.17 9.17 B: what do you think 

8.36 8.83 A: um 

9.20 14.28 A: i i i can't see that i would take the the million dollars um i mean 

15.03 17.64 A: friendship is obviously important to me and um and 

17.81 21.72 A: uh and there i mean there's other issues that come in and i'm like as a 

21.82 23.06 A: as a 

23.19 26.19 A: i'm a college student um and i've got uh like a 

26.30 35.11 A: pretty good life looking ahead of ahead of me so it's not like i need the money for anything so um that would be my thought on the subject so how about you 

29.76 30.25 B: mhm 

31.96 32.37 B: right 

35.89 36.84 B: yeah i don't 

39.75 40.15 A: mhm 

40.97 41.43 A: yeah 

43.18 47.51 B: i would take you know any amount of money to never talk to her again so 

46.18 46.79 A: yeah that would 

47.06 48.38 A: that that would be uh 

47.76 49.84 B: like not an option so 

48.64 51.56 A: a particularly strong case is that how long have you been married 

51.86 54.83 B: um i've been married like almost four years it's been about 

55.07 57.13 B: three and half a little over three and a half years so 

58.26 59.34 A: and very happy 

59.15 59.63 B: oh yeah 

59.62 60.15 A: that's great 

59.80 60.23 B: definitely 

60.75 61.69 A: that's good to hear 

62.16 63.73 B: yeah and like you said i mean 

64.17 65.12 B: there's a lot of other 

65.91 67.12 B: things in life that 

68.03 69.40 B: going well it's not like 

69.57 69.93 B: i'm 

70.53 71.85 B: in need of a million dollars but 

71.70 72.08 A: right 

72.08 73.26 B: yeah 

72.56 77.30 A: yeah i mean a million dollars can never hurt but like 

74.00 74.72 B: that'd be great but 

75.20 76.46 B: yeah 

78.73 84.93 A: can you think of an- an- un- un- i'm trying cause i don't i feel like that's just sort of a yes or no question so um 

84.52 84.91 B: right 

85.26 91.40 A: can you think of other like dubious circumstances under which you would take the million dollars or like 

91.81 92.53 B: um 

94.79 95.62 B: well like 

95.98 98.03 B: yeah i don't know i just 

98.98 99.87 B: that just seems kind of 

100.52 104.92 B: slimy you know cause if it was your best friend it just kind of seems like 

101.19 102.96 A: yeah yeah it is it's 

104.40 107.22 A: yeah yeah the the whole um 

105.12 106.15 B: you're selling your best friend 

107.39 116.40 A: anonymous benefactor thing is is kind of sketchy for this person to just come up to you and say um here's a million dollars if you do this um 

109.43 109.81 B: right 

113.15 113.51 B: yeah 

116.97 117.30 B: right 

117.94 119.05 A: in in general 

118.46 119.85 B: it doesn't happen very often but 

119.66 126.83 A: yeah yeah yeah this is this is uh i guess all the hypothetical situations are a little bit um odd but this one seems particularly um 

124.00 124.75 B: right 

127.07 127.65 B: yeah 

127.64 129.14 A: unrealistic so 

129.90 130.33 A: um 

131.45 131.86 B: cool 

132.05 132.39 B: well 

133.15 135.03 B: i don't know what else we're supposed to say anything 

134.96 138.22 A: yeah have you have you done this one have you done this before or 

137.55 139.31 B: no this is my first time 

138.75 141.26 A: yeah this is my first call as well so 

141.21 142.19 B: so i guess we just 

142.38 142.77 B: say 

143.49 143.78 A: we 

143.51 144.25 B: all right and 

144.45 145.09 B: hang up huh 

144.96 149.45 A: yeah well i think i think we're supposed to um talk for the complete ten minutes so 

149.39 150.10 B: oh okay 

150.21 151.42 B: well that's good to know 

151.04 151.86 A: um 

151.61 159.82 B: i didn't even think of that 

152.87 153.93 A: um yeah 

154.31 157.62 A: the that be i that would be my guess at least so um 

164.11 169.68 A: um uh yeah well this one is sort of the same i guess one million dollars to leave the u._s. um 

169.80 172.49 A: how would you feel about that one and never return 

170.07 170.59 B: uh 

172.42 175.05 B: never return to the u._s. for a million dollars hm 

176.46 179.83 B: that one's a little more tempting to me 

177.75 178.28 A: yeah 

178.60 180.28 A: yeah yeah where do you live 

180.33 182.03 B: uh i'm in provo 

182.15 182.49 A: mhm 

182.24 183.17 B: utah so 

182.82 183.15 A: mhm 

183.37 183.89 B: how about you 

183.86 187.27 A: um i'm outside um philadelphia pennsylvania so 

186.92 187.48 B: oh cool 

187.53 189.29 A: yeah and um 

189.48 191.17 A: and i i actually spent um 

191.62 199.87 A: last fall in um rome studying abroad um and it was pretty cool um so i mean i don't know if i if i'd 

196.90 197.33 B: yeah 

200.05 202.39 A: could live in italy my whole life cause it's just (( )) 

202.53 203.34 A: completely 

203.73 207.72 A: different um outlook on life and everything but um 

205.71 206.06 B: right 

208.75 210.03 B: yeah just uh the 

210.71 211.29 B: the ability 

211.51 212.46 B: that would come from 

212.56 213.81 B: cause like 

214.06 218.74 B: my wife would have a hard time living outside the u._s. and i you know and i love the u._s. but 

217.19 217.59 A: mhm 

218.47 218.90 A: yeah 

219.54 223.32 B: if that was you know that's kind of a different situation i think on that one i would probably 

221.75 222.29 A: yeah 

224.11 225.54 B: at least think about it and 

225.24 232.44 A: yeah yeah that's what i um and and i mean canada is not that different from the u._s. um so 

229.62 230.08 B: right 

230.48 230.98 B: right 

232.12 233.25 B: could you know 

233.42 237.57 B: put your money in the bank and live off of interest and 

235.00 235.46 A: yeah 

236.28 240.55 A: yeah absolutely that i mean that's what i always tell people if i if i got a million dollars just 

237.75 238.01 B: right 

240.73 244.53 A: put it in the bank and live off the interest you don't need to go off and buy 

244.36 244.70 B: right 

244.71 247.91 A: big fancy houses or expensive cars or anything um 

248.12 248.48 B: yeah 

249.14 251.27 A: i mean see people win the lottery and then they 

251.38 251.63 A: they 

251.83 256.60 A: do all this stuff with the money and then they they're break broke again within like 

256.36 256.86 B: right 

256.91 257.72 A: and i 

258.80 264.64 A: it's a different outlook on life i guess i mean my my brother and i are my younger brother and i are completely different in that respect he 

265.20 274.18 A: he gets a paycheck and within like a week it's it's all gone it seems like and he he's thinking about buying a new ca- or a new used car and everything and it's just 

270.51 270.90 B: right 

274.48 281.67 A: he he just doesn't have the money and i just don't understand how he how he keeps going like this and i'm curious to see how he'll turn out and everything so 

281.55 282.15 B: mhm 

282.91 283.61 B: well i think 

284.34 290.77 B: i mean you're in college now and you kind of know how that is to save you have to be careful with your money otherwise you can't 

287.62 288.05 A: yeah 

288.60 289.50 A: yeah yeah 

290.88 293.63 B: go to next you know go on to next semester 

291.67 292.09 A: yeah 

301.72 302.09 B: mhm 

310.23 310.83 B: (( that's right )) 

311.27 316.77 A: and like when i'm on campus i don't really have any expenses or anything so it's pretty much like that's just going right into the bank 

317.53 318.08 B: good deal 

318.53 319.70 A: about a hundred bucks a week that 

320.11 321.66 A: just storing away and everything so 

320.33 320.68 B: yeah 

321.70 322.41 B: that's great 

322.53 323.15 A: what do you do 

323.88 326.33 B: um i'm i'm doing both like uh 

327.03 330.16 B: working on campus i have two jobs on campus but it's only about 

328.80 329.16 A: mhm 

331.01 333.39 B: probably uh ten or twenty hours a week so it's 

332.86 333.23 A: mhm 

333.51 334.96 B: not too bad but 

335.61 336.71 B: keeps me busy you know 

336.39 336.74 A: mhm 

336.88 337.38 B: and 

342.37 343.10 A: no no 

344.11 347.03 B: yeah when you're on your own it's a little bit i think as far as 

344.17 344.56 A: yeah 

346.39 346.76 A: mhm 

347.84 349.65 B: preparing for the future but uh 

350.55 351.18 B: yeah we 

351.42 352.06 B: my wife 

352.66 355.77 B: you know she generally would be working at the same time and so we 

356.25 357.43 B: usually do pretty well but 

357.69 358.12 B: it's 

358.73 361.05 B: tuition is pretty expensive we haven't really 

362.19 368.40 B: gotten a lot of loans and stuff so we've now it's been good we've been able to stay out of debt but it's 

363.40 363.84 A: mhm 

367.46 368.42 A: right right 

368.80 369.48 B: kind of living 

370.20 371.89 B: you know from semester to semester 

371.43 371.79 A: mhm 

372.19 373.54 A: what what are you studying 

372.26 372.59 B: but 

373.65 377.93 B: um i was studying in chinese i got a bachelors in chinese now i'm 

376.88 377.21 A: mhm 

378.16 380.26 B: doing it's called language acquisition it's kind of 

379.63 380.08 A: mhm 

381.04 383.18 B: more about how to learn language and some things so 

381.08 381.41 A: that's 

381.99 385.39 A: you know that's very interesting because i'm actually a linguistics major 

385.23 386.12 B: cool 

385.86 387.76 A: um some stuff that i i've 

387.85 390.46 A: i've i've i've studied a little bit 

390.76 392.41 A: and just in in um 

393.39 401.33 A: in being in rome um and trying to learn italian some some stuff i realized about foreign languages and stuff 

400.99 401.52 B: yeah 

402.26 403.10 B: how long were you there 

403.74 405.39 A: i was there about um 

406.61 408.43 A: just under four months um 

408.18 409.62 B: four months yeah that's good 

409.76 415.11 A: and then you you learn quickly when you're immersed in the language and you have to learn it to 

415.32 417.19 A: to get by and everything so 

416.79 421.21 B: mhm were their a lot of english speakers there or was it pretty 

420.23 421.13 A: in um 

421.36 429.10 A: in rome around like the touristy areas like down by the coliseum at saint peters there were a lot of people that um 

426.38 427.00 B: mhm 

429.53 436.13 A: that spoke at least some english but once you got into like the city itself and um where the tourists didn't go 

436.98 437.54 A: there 

438.95 440.64 A: there some people would be able to like 

440.76 441.02 A: get 

441.14 448.17 A: by in english but um it was a whole lot easier my italian after a month or so was better then their english so 

443.16 443.98 B: yeah 

448.13 450.96 B: wow that's good that helps 

449.18 450.12 A: yeah 

450.61 457.88 A: yeah yeah and i i had studied french and spanish in high school and college so learning italian was 

458.46 459.47 A: was easier so 

459.16 459.61 B: yeah 

460.65 461.35 B: well that's good 

460.66 461.68 A: have you been to china 

462.16 471.56 B: yeah we went to my wife and i went to taiwan for like it was about three and a half months so about the same amount of time but i had a different experience so this is so funny because 

466.02 466.39 A: mhm 

467.88 468.23 A: mhm 

472.37 475.62 B: the people there were either afraid to talk to us because they didn't know english 

475.40 475.76 A: mhm 

476.47 477.02 B: um 

477.24 478.96 B: even though we wanted to speak chinese or 

479.53 483.29 B: there's a lot of dialects there's a dialect there called taiwanese 

483.07 483.42 A: mhm 

484.05 490.17 B: and uh so the older people spoke taiwanese and the young people were kind of 

487.50 487.94 A: mhm 

490.45 495.15 B: hesitant to talk to us and and of course my chinese really wasn't good enough to 

495.41 500.57 B: warrant them wanting to talk to me so i was it was fun though it was a good experience so 

495.92 496.40 A: mhm 

499.94 504.67 A: yeah yeah from everything i've heard chinese is very difficult with the tones and everything 

504.81 505.26 A: so 

504.88 506.43 B: yeah it's 

506.78 507.72 B: it makes it a little bit 

507.99 508.41 B: you know 

508.56 511.58 B: and at having not spoken a tonal language before then 

510.83 511.91 A: mhm yeah yeah 

512.64 514.68 B: but you know it comes slowly so 

514.36 514.72 A: mhm 

515.60 523.55 A: yeah the uh i'm taking a class this semester on um the structure of kahn which is a language spoken in ghana um 

523.10 524.05 B: oh yeah 

523.77 532.66 A: and we aren't like we aren't learning how to speak the language we are just learning stuff about the language but so we are picking up a little of the language along the way 

529.35 529.80 B: right 

538.03 538.84 B: yeah 

543.14 545.49 A: i i'm used to because in english 

545.62 548.93 A: it doesn't matter and it's something new so 

546.76 547.43 B: right 

549.22 550.50 B: yeah that's good 

550.20 553.17 A: it's good to train your hear to recognize different stuff though so 

551.00 551.61 B: good background 

553.30 554.10 B: yeah definitely 

554.27 560.12 A: and the professor is actually from ghana which is great so we actually get a native speaker so 

557.38 557.73 B: wow 

558.92 559.42 B: that's 

560.51 562.81 B: yeah that's always a plus 

562.07 563.31 A: yeah yeah it is 

564.27 564.59 B: cool 

565.65 566.79 B: what got you into 

567.05 567.53 B: i don't know 

568.14 569.04 A: linguistics 

568.86 569.28 B: yeah 

578.14 581.77 A: me and text i can read it out loud but i won't know what i 

582.10 582.53 B: oh 

582.54 587.14 A: i'll just know i'll know like the letters and how to sound it out and everything so i had this 

585.66 586.25 B: that's neat 

587.43 595.11 A: so i wanted to learn some hebrew because it's a it's a good language to know in terms of studying religion and what not um 

591.57 592.03 B: yeah 

594.73 595.25 B: definitely
