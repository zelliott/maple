71.54 73.02 B: a lot of times you know 

73.18 77.24 B: you know when when after you have children and things like that it is kind of you know hard to

79.56 80.06 A: yeah 

80.25 81.07 B: you know but 

81.61 83.94 B: you know i kind of noticed that um 

84.22 90.17 B: you know different situations that people are going through now they are having a lot of different programs and stuff 

90.43 91.95 B: you know like when you have kids 

92.16 92.50 A: yeah 

92.38 94.19 B: if you want to try something 

94.55 97.92 B: you know a lot of times they'll give you they they have uh free 

98.20 98.72 B: um 

99.76 102.14 B: day care you know when you have small children 

101.01 102.06 A: yeah yeah 

102.28 106.73 B: and that is a good thing i mean you know because you know 

104.23 104.68 A: yeah 

106.88 110.97 B: if they are going to offer you school it's it's really hard sometimes you know when you have 

111.21 113.61 B: kids and you don't have anyone to watch them you know 

113.59 114.35 A: yeah 

114.23 122.43 B: i know that because you know i have a sister that has she has four children and um she finally got in to a program where she started taking i think some 

122.55 123.47 B: was it um 

123.57 124.69 B: nurses assistant 

124.75 125.24 A: yeah 

125.12 132.45 B: and that was a really good thing you know for her and she she was all worried about her children so you know she got some help 

132.56 137.64 B: you know through the county and then they they uh actually paid a family member 

137.45 137.94 A: yeah 

138.08 142.50 B: and that's and that was a good thing you know they they let her pick who she wanted 

138.51 139.49 A: yeah 

142.67 143.13 A: yeah 

143.39 144.94 B: you know so i mean that is 

144.15 144.95 A: (( that's a good )) (( )) 

145.15 146.34 B: that's pretty good huh 

145.93 147.68 A: yeah yeah i think so 

147.74 148.51 B: yeah and my 

148.61 151.17 B: self i basically um 

151.75 162.84 B: i i got married at seventeen and i think that that would be something if i had to do all over again i think that would be something that i would've changed because pretty much i grew up with him 

158.47 159.51 A: yeah (( )) 

163.14 163.66 A: yeah 

163.76 166.66 B: and you know and then after you 

166.78 168.45 B: even though you love a person 

168.50 168.92 A: yeah 

169.19 170.60 B: after you get a you know get 

170.90 182.41 B: to a certain point in your life you don't really necessarily want to be you know dealing with the same situation if you you know because they think of you as a kid especially if they are a lot older than you 

182.48 183.65 A: yeah yes 

182.62 187.46 B: -cause he is like i'd say about my husband is about ten years older than me so 

187.62 199.33 B: it makes you wonder what would it be like if i had waited you know and found someone you know waited -til i was twenty something and then you know like a lot of people do and and married the the man of my dreams you know 

191.64 192.09 A: yeah 

199.01 200.09 A: yeah yeah 

199.50 207.67 B: you took a little time to look around more and not just the first person that you you know thought you fell in love with which was puppy love you know
