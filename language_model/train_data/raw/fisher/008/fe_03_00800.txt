13.43 14.82 A: (( oh yeah )) 

13.94 15.61 B: i think it's something that 

16.35 19.84 B: i i've talked about with my friends hypothetically 

19.39 20.32 A: uh-huh 

20.06 20.81 B: ah 

21.12 24.34 B: just sort of a way to make money but nothing i've ever 

24.69 26.48 B: seriously considered 

26.82 31.93 B: um one of the things we've talked about is opening a club um 

31.21 31.94 A: (( oh )) 

32.13 33.90 B: 'cause i'm a student so 

33.96 42.11 B: and ah i live in a college town so that's something that we do a lot and spend a lot of our own money on [laughter] so 

36.52 38.49 A: yeah 

41.76 43.38 A: [laughter] 

42.59 44.48 B: we could see the ways that 

44.53 47.63 B: ah you could make a lot of money from it i guess 

47.64 58.00 A: yeah like and do you see like if there is a certain kind of club you would go to it but there isn't one so you'd like to open one like that 

57.01 60.35 B: um i'm not sure i mean th- there are several 

60.51 64.36 B: ah around where we live that are really good and 

65.01 69.56 B: um people go to a lot but there's always 

70.25 76.27 B: i guess when you live in a college town there's always like the places that everyone goes to and then 

75.63 76.74 A: mhm 

76.29 78.88 B: the places that people don't so 

78.96 81.04 B: you know you could think of ways to 

81.65 85.67 B: take over those ones and make 'em better you know better music and 

86.02 86.93 B: ah 

87.57 90.59 B: you know just better atmosphere and um 

87.65 88.78 A: yeah 

92.37 95.14 B: you know keeping it a lot of times 

95.15 97.10 B: keeping it over twenty one 

97.13 98.53 B: is a good way to 

98.86 100.47 B: keep it a little more 

100.89 103.35 B: i guess it keeps it 

103.57 107.79 B: like a little classier you know a little more upscale if it's over twenty one 

105.12 106.04 A: uh-huh 

108.23 109.35 B: um 

109.97 111.11 B: also 

111.43 112.53 B: keeping it 

112.60 113.94 B: affordable 

114.54 115.86 B: for um 

117.17 118.70 B: students i guess 

117.62 118.99 A: yeah students 

119.06 120.41 B: is another thing 

121.73 123.20 B: how about yourself 

123.37 128.20 A: um well me and my husband have thought about opening lots of businesses 

128.43 129.39 A: um 

130.13 142.75 A: like ev- every time we think we need this [laughter] hey we could open a business and make money [laughter] but um we've never done it um we've had this dream of after 

134.53 135.67 B: [laughter] 

136.14 137.00 B: uh-huh 

143.05 150.65 A: we you know live our life working the nine to five grind of opening a restaurant together 

146.96 147.79 B: (( mhm )) 

150.27 151.17 B: mhm 

150.69 154.87 A: just the two of us when we're older and that would be fun because we both like to cook 

155.22 160.71 A: and you know every time we talk about it we have different ideas of what kind of food we'd serve or 

159.55 160.77 B: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

160.83 169.63 A: it would be you know one specific kind of food or a vegetarian restaurant or no it would be any kind of food from all over the world because we also like to travel 

167.41 168.56 B: mhm 

170.33 172.22 A: um that sort of thing 

172.02 173.21 B: mhm 

172.58 175.99 A: but restaurants are scary the 

176.28 179.18 A: um to open a restaurant's really risky 

178.93 179.80 B: mhm 

180.67 184.02 B: i think opening any kind of business that would 

184.20 191.40 B: that's either like a restaurant or a bar or a club or any kind of like food or entertainment [cough] kind of depends on 

187.38 189.52 A: yeah 

191.59 193.67 B: what the people like wherever 

193.74 200.39 B: you happen to open it what what else is around that you know is competition and 

197.94 199.55 A: yeah exactly 

200.50 201.58 B: um 

202.54 205.32 B: a lot of it is the image 

205.42 208.00 B: that you put into it too i think like 

207.44 217.81 A: i think so like yeah and like you were talking about your club you'd have to find a an atmosphere thing to make your niche so that people 

214.18 214.99 B: right 

217.47 218.42 B: right 

218.18 223.94 A: want to come to your place specifically because they like the atmosphere or think it's cool 

224.72 225.72 B: (( right a )) 

225.95 232.00 B: lot of people don't want to i mean actually some people prefer to go to a place that's 

232.06 238.89 B: not as nice and you know a little bit more laid back where you don't have to dress a certain way but 

238.27 239.94 A: right 

239.27 240.76 B: every once in a while 

240.82 241.67 B: (( ah )) 

242.41 245.83 B: even people who don't like to do that all the time would like to 

245.81 260.16 B: you know on special occasions and stuff go to somewhere where it's nice and people are dressed nicely and there's a nice place to sit down as well as somewhere where you can dance and you know you feel also you feel safe there 

247.52 249.27 A: yeah 

260.18 262.39 A: yeah that's a big one 

262.39 263.94 B: yeah i mean with 

264.34 266.16 B: a lot of ah 

266.79 269.36 B: bars and clubs and stuff that i've been to 

269.95 271.70 B: certain ones that 

271.74 273.05 B: aren't 

273.16 280.44 B: really as nice there you know there can be fights and people are just being stupid and 

279.84 281.31 A: mhm 

280.84 283.46 B: it it makes you not have fun so 

283.84 287.40 B: you'd want to kind of you'd have to keep a certain image for 

288.02 289.06 B: um 

289.61 291.81 B: for it to go right basically 

292.21 294.49 A: yeah so 

294.94 295.78 B: (( [cough] )) 

295.41 299.36 A: p._r. would be very important to opening that sort of business 

296.94 297.88 B: mhm 

299.22 300.14 B: (( yeah )) 

299.53 300.90 A: for a restaurant too 

302.33 303.18 A: just 

303.35 305.56 A: word of mouth and that sort of thing as well 

305.61 306.45 B: what 

306.15 308.04 A: and word of mouth 

307.27 308.08 B: mm 

308.32 309.53 A: be big 

309.64 312.74 B: that's true i think another thing though is that 

312.95 317.02 B: i mean at least at the beginning you'd have to spend all your time there 

316.82 318.19 A: oh yeah 

317.50 320.09 B: getting it started i mean i mean eventually you'd 

320.23 328.54 B: you'd work up to where you can have a staff that you can trust to you know be honest and 

323.74 325.08 A: yeah 

329.13 333.16 B: do things the way that you want them done and not 

333.39 336.57 B: ah mess things up or try to you know 

336.96 338.75 B: steal your money or [laughter] 

338.31 339.43 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

338.99 342.09 B: anything like that but um at first i mean 

342.24 356.84 B: i'm sure like at least the first couple of years it would have to you'd have to be constantly on top of it and there every day and every night making sure that people were happy and kind of also seeing if you know any changes need to be made to 

347.53 348.34 A: yeah 

357.10 361.14 B: you know the kind of food you're serving or the kind of music you're playing or 

360.41 362.23 A: mhm 

361.38 364.28 B: the you know the decoration or 

364.31 366.10 B: anything like that so 

366.25 372.85 A: yeah i think you're right at the beginning of any business like that y- it would have to be your life for 

373.33 380.10 A: a while while you built it up which i think that's what's so daunting about starting your own businesses 

374.95 376.07 B: exactly 

380.34 386.22 A: you know you spend your life on it for a certain period of time and then if it fails 

386.62 392.30 A: it's a big blow i think i think that's why more people don't do it you know what i mean 

387.74 388.75 B: mhm 

392.11 393.43 B: mhm 

393.50 396.00 B: mhm i actually know um 

396.36 397.82 B: a family who 

397.84 400.21 B: opened ah their own deli 

400.37 404.05 B: and i think it was for like the first 

404.07 406.48 B: maybe two or three years that 

407.08 410.65 B: they weren't really doing very good business um 

409.43 410.37 A: uh-huh 

411.00 412.29 B: and 

413.40 427.29 B: ah it was just you know it was kind of slow because there were a lot of other ah places it it was in a business district and there were you know tons of other places where people could go and it was a tiny little place but eventually 

427.71 428.69 A: mhm 

427.96 430.53 B: um ended up doing so well that 

431.03 434.99 B: ah they opened up a liquor store next door and another deli 

434.57 435.64 A: wow 

435.07 444.07 B: in the next town over so but that was after like it was the first two or three years that they weren't doing well then they started doing well and i think it was about four years after that 

444.29 445.55 A: wow 

444.33 449.55 B: they were eventually able to expand it so i mean it does it takes a lot of time and patience and 

449.58 451.85 B: i know there were several times where 

451.99 455.71 B: they had considered you know giving up and 

455.08 456.99 A: yeah 

455.73 457.88 B: going and doing something else but 

458.05 462.18 A: yeah i think you'd have to have a vision you know of 

462.33 470.57 A: something you're waiting you're waiting it out because you have this vision of how it can be [laughter] if you just wait long enough and work hard enough 

467.23 468.47 B: exactly 

471.37 474.59 A: so you can't be half hearted about it i totally agree 

474.39 476.95 B: exactly and i think that also if it 

476.98 483.11 B: if it involves someone who has a family and often times i think the whole family gets involved in it 

482.79 484.08 A: mhm 

483.43 486.00 B: and it becomes something that's 

486.04 493.29 B: a commitment for everyone like this this family that i was talking about that ah owns a the deli and the liquor store and everything now 

493.56 499.65 B: um when they first started even you know their kids were coming and working there after school and 

498.97 500.53 A: mhm 

499.78 501.01 B: you know um 

501.06 504.92 B: they had nieces and nephews who came and helped out 

505.16 506.10 B: um 

506.25 508.70 B: after hours and stuff you know so it's 

508.96 514.44 B: i mean it takes a lot of commitment and also a lot of support from family and friends to really 

515.12 516.04 A: uh-huh 

515.59 520.44 B: get something like that going and keep it going really 

516.64 518.14 A: definitely 

520.58 523.83 A: yeah and like in my situation where 

523.90 531.64 A: if my husband would want to start something or if i would want to start something we'd totally need each other's commitment because otherwise it'd be such a strain 

529.05 530.03 B: mhm 

531.74 532.72 B: (( right mhm )) 

532.29 533.40 A: (( you know if )) 

533.44 538.73 A: if one of us is doing something the other didn't really believe in and was taking so much time and energy 

539.30 542.26 A: so it wouldn't hardly be worth it yeah it just takes so much 

542.05 543.27 B: exactly 

544.15 545.31 A: (( work in the beginning )) 

545.82 548.69 A: (( that's what's scary to me so much work for a )) 

548.75 551.10 A: (( possibility [laughter] mhm you know th- th- wherever you )) 

550.68 551.65 B: mhm 

551.83 553.88 A: (( live offers so many other )) 

554.25 556.64 A: (( opportunities you know so many other restaurants and so )) 

555.74 559.00 B: yeah it's true it's i mean it's a big risk it's um 

562.09 563.36 B: especially if you're 

562.46 563.21 A: (( many other )) 

564.21 566.46 B: in a place where there's so many 

566.26 568.62 A: (( bars and )) 

570.76 571.61 B: other 

575.15 576.29 A: (( things right )) 

576.05 577.35 B: things it's 

577.95 580.87 B: something like that is just it's a huge risk and 

580.96 591.06 B: you know it- it's constantly how do you make yourself better than the next person and how do you keep it better than the next person who's going to open another place 

591.04 592.15 A: right 

592.43 599.90 A: and on the other hand if you you may open something totally new but if it's in a small community where there aren't enough people to support it
