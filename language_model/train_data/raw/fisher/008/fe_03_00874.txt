0.00 1.75 B: [mn] hi i'm joshua 

1.59 3.23 A: hi i'm brita 

2.66 4.34 B: [mn] i'm sorry what was your name 

4.36 5.34 A: um brita 

5.27 6.56 B: brita nice to mee- 

5.94 7.64 A: it's like rita with a b 

7.22 8.87 B: oh [mn] okay 

8.62 9.89 A: yeah 

9.28 12.08 B: so ah are you in favor of affirmative action 

12.11 13.93 A: [mn] [mn] you know um 

12.39 12.95 B: (( [mn] )) 

13.98 17.39 A: [mn] it's really not a yes or no for me it's kind of 

18.42 24.36 A: i guess to some extent yeah but a lot of times ah it gets mistaken as a quota system 

24.29 27.76 B: [mn] yeah exactly so that's basic [mn] oh 

27.98 38.00 B: well is it so there's quota systems but then there's also things where for instance um sometimes you know there's there's one thing there's lots of [mn] well there's lots of kinds of affirmative action right there's when people 

38.11 41.27 B: um [lipsmack] just try to do more recruiting 

40.98 41.74 A: (( ahah )) 

41.46 54.10 B: you know you try to you just you just work extra hard to find qualified candidates and th- [mn] and then there's times which sounds fine and then there's things like [mn] especially i'm a i'm a computer programmer and i've seen lots of um [lipsmack] 

46.05 46.79 A: (( ahah )) 

54.18 57.91 B: internship programs and things for like [mn] they have affirmative action 

58.01 60.07 B: for students 

60.16 63.96 B: to try [noise] to try to get people later which which seems o._k. 

60.24 61.14 A: (( ahah and )) 

62.77 65.53 A: (( i think that's great yeah i think that's )) 

64.65 65.64 B: but then 

66.72 73.24 B: but then i've also seen things like in fire departments or wherever where [mn] like they'll have a test and you have to score you know twenty points less 

73.54 74.62 B: (( ah )) 

73.81 74.50 A: (( less )) 

74.71 84.45 B: like like y- you know there so- for like some public things they'll have a test that you take [mn] and and if you're of a certain race or whatever then you can score you can get a lower score and still get in 

79.44 80.37 A: (( oh okay )) 

84.79 86.06 A: (( oh )) 

85.46 87.55 B: and that that doesn't seem right 

86.67 88.62 A: yeah that i don't think is 

88.69 95.46 A: i don't agree on that but if i were in a situation where i lost a job to somebody who was exact same 

95.52 97.83 A: score as me the exact same 

98.15 102.91 A: um qualifications as [noise] me um yeah then i would be fine with it 

102.74 106.00 B: if you mean if loss was just as a tiebreaker and nothing else [mn] 

105.94 107.56 A: yeah 

107.21 113.60 B: yeah sometimes s- i've i've seen cases where people claim it's a tiebreaker but then it's not really 

113.21 115.23 A: yeah i guess that's a good point tiebreaker 

115.46 116.46 B: ah 

116.76 117.55 B: (( you kn- if )) 

116.80 121.30 A: yeah but it it doesn't really work out like that right most of the time 

121.18 134.91 B: [mn] oh no i think it i think it was the university of michigan that's not really in hiring but still um claim that they had they have a a score based system and they were adding like ten or twenty points and they claimed it was a tiebreaker except it was ten or twenty points i mean it was 

134.38 135.20 A: (( ahah [noise] )) 

135.01 141.83 B: on a um i d- i can't remember what the number was [lipsmack] like sometimes people say it's a tiebreaker but it isn't really 

142.10 142.88 A: (( okay i )) 

143.07 144.29 B: yeah 

143.86 145.61 A: think at the same time i just 

146.16 154.23 A: i mean i'm white and i just get sick of going to universities here going here and there and just seeing mostly white people and i know it's not 

147.34 148.62 B: (( yeah )) 

154.31 165.22 A: i know it's a lot of times maybe other people aren't being able to go to these universities for example because ah maybe because they just don't have opportunities like a lot of white americans do 

164.99 171.87 B: [mn] um yeah well well i i'm at at the university level i'm i'm in favor of ah 

171.86 172.49 B: [mn] 

172.37 180.35 B: well i mean we i'd consider affirmative action but but there are issues with race for instance i had a coworker who who married a mexic- 

178.12 178.80 A: (( ahah )) 

180.22 189.92 B: [mn] who married a woman whose mother was mexican and so he and he's very well off and very and and reasonably well educated and stuff but his children will count as hispanic 

182.97 183.83 A: okay 

190.06 191.07 A: (( oh okay )) 

190.24 197.09 B: um even though you kn- they will be one quarter hispanic and he's actually [mn] yeah ah [mn] they're not in the least disadvantaged 

194.74 196.15 A: yeah okay well 

197.10 203.30 A: in that in that yeah in that situation no but i guess they can't really take and look at case by case situation right 

202.91 204.38 B: (( well sure they can )) 

204.27 206.72 A: you think they can 'cause if they could that would be better 

206.21 215.45 B: well i i mean there are other there are other things like parental education right so people whose parents okay you can ask people whether their parents went to college and what their parents' income was 

215.24 224.06 B: [mn] and those kind of things are probably better indicators of of whether you come from a disadvantaged background [mn] than than what your race is 

215.72 216.47 A: (( ahah )) 

223.41 228.89 A: yeah that's true so maybe they could do something [mn] instead of maybe making it affirmative action um 

228.95 235.49 A: as far as race maybe socioeconomic status i don't know i don't know if that would work but maybe that'd be more close to what we're trying to get 

234.85 237.26 B: certainly it seems more fair 

236.83 238.39 A: yeah that's true 

238.39 239.43 B: (( ah )) 

239.53 250.98 B: um that's a little hard to do at the at the business like in college it sort of makes some sense but then like once you [mn] you know if you [mn] [mn] by the time you're out into the business world asking asking [mn] ques- 

250.93 254.56 B: somebody about their parents' socioeconomic level starting to seem a little odd 

251.12 251.80 A: yeah 

255.16 256.52 A: (( that's true that's true )) 

257.02 261.08 A: (( but um huh it's kind of a tricky situation )) 

261.18 262.21 A: [mn] um 

262.66 263.35 A: (( hm )) 

263.29 265.73 B: (( [mn] it's a little weird for me we ah )) 

266.04 269.76 B: (( where i work sorry a- as i say i'm a computer programmer and it's a little odd there's )) 

269.83 271.98 B: there's very few 

272.11 275.46 B: anything but white and asian males 

274.94 277.59 A: do you think there's very few that are non white 

277.01 285.42 B: there well there's asian male there's asian man and white man and maybe the occasional indian man but you kn- black men no hispanic men no women no 

285.46 286.56 B: (( [mn] ah )) 

285.66 286.63 A: really 

286.69 288.13 B: (( ah not in the computer [mn] )) 

287.00 288.01 A: (( how many how many )) 

289.25 290.56 A: how many employees 

291.02 296.72 B: oh i mean it you know it's not that there's zero in the company but just ah you know on my 

296.88 301.75 B: um in my see in my division i know there are no black people 

301.61 303.55 A: [noise] and how large is that 

302.05 303.17 B: ah 

303.31 305.14 B: that's about four hundred people 

304.89 306.23 A: four hundred people 

306.00 307.08 B: yeah 

306.41 307.82 A: and there's no blacks at all 

307.63 309.05 B: none [mn] 

308.83 311.28 A: wh- where what part of the country is this 

311.11 321.77 B: ah it's it's in ah it's in seattle it's [mn] it's not a particularly it's not a particularly diverse area to start with but ah you'd think you'd think there'd be 

314.60 315.51 A: (( oh really [mn] )) 

322.14 325.80 B: some i mean we we recruit from a all over the country so 

325.91 326.92 B: (( ah )) 

326.45 329.07 A: yeah the funny thing is i'm i'm actually from seattle too 

329.15 330.30 B: [laughter] 

329.67 332.61 A: um [laughter] interesting [mn] but um 

333.72 339.26 A: [mn] and the strange thing is i had a really good friend who did work at an internet company 

338.84 339.71 B: (( ahah )) 

339.44 342.06 A: and they made a conscious effort i guess i don't know if they 

341.29 350.12 B: oh yeah if somebody if somebody works hard at it they they work very hard to try to to recruit ah it's just very hard ah 

342.16 342.90 A: i 

344.01 344.82 A: yeah 

349.43 350.23 A: yeah 

350.44 351.46 B: (( they're they're )) 

351.79 352.80 B: um 

353.41 362.16 B: ah they among other things they have some some some some inter- i think they try to get interns and things [mn] too who are you know from from different backgrounds 

362.17 363.94 B: (( but ah )) 

366.00 368.77 B: [mn] but for whatever reason there aren't there aren't a lot [mn] 

369.60 371.42 A: for whatever reason what was that [noise] 

370.94 374.23 B: for for whatever reason there there just aren't a lot of of 

375.32 376.13 A: (( [noise] i'm sorry )) 

376.88 378.27 A: (( [laughter] )) 

377.82 378.62 B: [laughter] 

379.12 380.73 A: um go ahead 

380.19 381.15 B: [mn] they're for 

381.17 388.31 B: you know i know i know they work hard to recruit people but they they don't seem to ah be able to to find people who they actually hire 

388.31 396.39 B: or th- th- they don't n- not even usually i i don't even think i mean i don't know who applies but i know i haven't even seen very many m- minority for the interview 

395.28 397.91 A: maybe there's fewer that meet the requirements right 

397.97 410.14 B: yeah well yeah i mean well it as i said compu- you know it's computer programming so [mn] i know that women tend to be less interested in [mn] um and that's i don't know wheth- i don't know what you know if there's so- some reason 

410.27 413.34 B: [mn] that few of our people end up as computer programmers or 

413.43 415.65 B: what what's going on there 

413.78 414.62 A: well 

415.12 420.16 A: yeah what is going on there um how how how did you get hired i mean i don't know if this has anything to do with it but 

419.91 421.04 B: ah 

420.31 420.87 A: (( [noise] )) 

421.12 422.15 B: i 

421.15 425.85 A: but do they make you perform a i mean is there a test to see if you can do 

424.83 428.69 B: (( it's yeah there's a th- there there's a lot of tough interviewing )) 

428.51 429.32 A: (( huh )) 

429.29 432.21 B: the the interviews are tough um 

431.11 431.90 A: (( mm )) 

432.38 433.17 A: (( mm )) 

432.43 446.95 B: you know but but i don't think i don't even think that's the issue 'cause i haven't even seen black people applying i think it has more to do with i haven't s- i haven't seen black computer programmers at other companies or any- you kn- it's fairly rare it's yeah it's certainly they're 

446.95 449.54 B: not evenly represented 

447.97 449.60 A: it might be rare but 

449.61 453.82 A: yeah i don't know my boyfriend's one [laughter] 

453.03 454.66 B: he's a black computer programmer 

454.55 462.65 A: yeah [laughter] this is why i'm c- like weird in in in seattle but anyway that's just maybe [mn] not very 

455.80 456.77 B: (( oh )) 

461.24 465.45 B: well like ob- obviously your boyfriend doesn't work in my division [mn] [mn] ah 

464.85 469.79 A: [laughter] no probably not do you mind if i ask ah what company 

469.19 472.92 B: [mn] i'd rather not say not because i don't want you to know but because ah 

472.47 474.57 A: oh because the ah m 

473.78 477.04 B: yeah because [mn] who kn- god only knows who's going to read this 

477.42 478.83 A: (( yeah mm )) 

478.38 479.45 B: (( [mn] ah )) 

479.50 482.18 A: interesting it's obviously pretty big though right [mn] 

482.03 483.91 B: yeah it's a big org it's a big company 

483.57 485.59 A: yeah huh 

484.79 485.77 B: um 

486.59 487.59 A: interesting 

488.05 488.94 B: (( so )) 

488.11 489.13 A: so ah 

489.23 494.94 B: ah have have you ever talked to your boyfriend about affirmative action or about whether he's he's found it hard he found it hard to get hired or 

494.78 499.94 A: um i i've talked to him about it a little bit and he is more under the impression that he doesn't 

500.24 501.83 A: um [mn] 

502.14 507.95 A: he doesn't want to be hired just because you know he's black or just because he's this so he kind of feels 

505.25 506.02 B: yeah 

508.21 512.97 A: you know he doesn't want to be handed any freebies so he tries you know very hard to um 

514.89 520.81 A: basically yeah i i'm not saying that he's not in favor of it but i'm sure that if there's a situation where he was um 

521.93 536.02 A: basically th- they had two choices for a certain position and one was white or asian and or not asian excuse me white and one and he was running oh kind of up against them i'm sure that he would feel that [mn] maybe he should be given the job 

536.25 541.81 B: ah does he come from a disadvantaged background or [mn] or a a an average background or 

540.66 545.11 A: well yeah because he's pretty angry about the whole feeling that maybe 

546.02 547.87 A: [mn] he deserves something what 

547.22 556.17 B: well so so so from that you know i've known black people from you know tough backgrounds i've known black people who are the children of lawyers ah 

555.55 557.16 A: was that say it again you know 

556.61 562.68 B: i've known black people who came from some pretty tough backgrounds but i've also known some black people who whose parents were lawyers and things like that right 

561.98 563.62 A: e- exactly yeah that's true 

562.95 568.91 B: the ones whose parents were lawyers i don't think ah have have experienced that much ah hardship 

569.02 569.96 B: (( ah )) 

569.32 570.05 A: (( true )) 

570.41 572.81 B: ah so what what about your boyfriend 

572.28 573.10 A: (( mm )) 

575.15 582.59 A: definitely didn't come from a privileged background definitely not but i'm not saying that they were you know dead poor [mn] but um 

581.12 581.95 B: (( ahah )) 

583.56 593.61 A: i think yeah but i think he feels like he has worked hard on his own to get to where he is and so i'm not [mn] see [mn] we haven't really i haven't really ever really asked him the question are you in favor of affirmative action but 

587.64 588.50 B: (( ahah )) 

594.22 595.30 A: (( um )) 

595.31 599.42 A: i we've definitely go- we've talked about you know that um [mn]
