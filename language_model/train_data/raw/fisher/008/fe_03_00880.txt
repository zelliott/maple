146.23 155.94 B: ah it's not yeah it's less than what you would pay in a regular theater but not much less but the idea is everybody that that's watching the movie wants to be there

156.10 157.05 A: right 

156.82 159.93 B: so you don't get the people talking on their cell phones

181.30 183.13 A: [laughter] they might be 

183.43 184.54 A: i don't know 

184.90 186.21 A: yeah i 

186.39 195.76 A: my biggest problem with going to see movies though is the price it seems like a lot of money and if i were to do it every week it would be kind of expensive i think 

195.99 200.61 A: [mn] so that's why i enjoy going to the dollar theater and just waiting a few months until it 

201.21 204.51 A: comes to the theater for a dollar 

203.37 207.71 B: [laughter] now they have a thing now they have a thing if you like to watch movies you can d- ah 

208.13 209.94 B: rent them on line 

210.29 213.34 B: (( like a netflix i don't know if you ever heard of that )) 

212.76 213.68 A: (( uh-uh )) 

213.84 221.38 B: yeah it's a um a website where you sign up and make a list and for twenty dollars a month 

221.47 224.52 B: you can see as many movies as 

224.74 229.72 B: you can as th- they send you three at a time and then you send one back they send you another 

230.36 231.41 A: really 

230.62 235.34 B: one yeah you make your list on line and they they send it to you right from the top of your list 

233.11 233.91 A: (( ahah )) 

235.42 239.20 B: so if you always have one in the mail you're getting movies every couple of days 

239.91 246.29 B: d._v._d.s yeah d._v._d._s. and they're prepaid mailers and you drop it in the mailbox and they mail mail you another one 

239.95 241.06 A: wow 

246.98 248.82 A: and and what is the website 

248.45 250.32 B: netflix dot com 

250.18 251.95 A: netflix hm 

251.36 256.80 B: (( and you know who else does it now ah wal-mart at wal-mart wal-mart dot com )) 

254.59 255.62 A: wow 

257.13 259.15 B: [mn] and they're a couple of dollars cheaper 

259.35 260.17 A: (( ahah )) 

261.11 263.56 A: gee whiz well that's good to know 

263.22 266.38 B: yeah i i'm just a fountain of information tonight 

266.22 276.06 A: yeah ah it's good to talk to you [laughter] yeah i i know that i've heard of cleanflicks where they take r. rated movies and edit them 

268.55 269.97 B: [laughter] yeah same here 

276.35 282.20 B: oh wow that i haven't heard of half the fun of watching an r. movie is so they don't clean 'em up 

276.62 277.48 A: which 

278.67 279.78 A: yes 

281.67 287.15 A: [laughter] yeah i think it's kind of silly too if you want to know the truth 

282.25 283.05 B: [laughter] 

286.47 291.79 B: i don't understand that i must again you live in utah i mean [laughter] 

288.47 289.34 A: because 

291.06 293.80 A: yeah exactly i think if there's only 

292.58 293.72 B: are you a mormon 

293.95 295.10 A: yes i am 

294.58 295.67 B: oh there you go 

295.50 296.88 A: mhm [mn] 

296.96 300.58 A: yeah the thing with the cleanflicks they can't take out 

300.93 303.60 A: like i don't think they actually take out 

303.81 305.99 A: maybe they can take out scenes 

305.70 307.94 B: oh but they they just clean them up 

306.98 307.99 A: but they 

308.14 309.83 A: yeah they take out some 

308.16 310.16 B: they clean up the dialogue [noise] 

310.26 319.44 A: yeah but the thing with the dialogue all they can do is really make it quiet so you can still see what they're saying and know exactly what they're doing 

318.94 321.10 B: yeah right [laughter] 

319.97 328.50 A: so i just think it's silly that people just want to be a part of it and yet they don't want to watch an r. movie so they think they're renting a cleanflick 

328.53 331.35 A: that they're somehow saving themselves 

332.09 334.68 B: that's interesting that's interesting 

332.35 333.52 A: but anyway 

334.48 335.80 A: yeah that's 

334.69 336.42 B: how long are we supposed to talk 

336.96 343.15 A: i think we're supposed to talk until that recording comes back on and says this is the end of your call 

343.76 345.04 A: (( and [mn] )) 

343.88 350.05 B: oh i i haven't this is the first ah one that i've actually gotten to i d- keep losing my p._i._n. 

350.43 352.41 A: oh really yeah this

355.30 368.09 A: oh i was gonna say this is my first phone call too [mn] but my friend is also doing this and he had he has received a call and in in order to receive your ten dollars you have to wait until they finish the phone call 

367.94 372.15 B: oh okay well i'm enjoying it so it it can't be bad 

369.14 370.04 A: yeah 

371.99 374.93 A: that's right absolutely not yeah so how 

373.74 376.38 B: is it the content or the linguistics
