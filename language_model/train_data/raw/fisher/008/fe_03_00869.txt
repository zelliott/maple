7.74 8.46 B: good 

8.78 10.86 A: about the public schools 

10.14 11.72 B: public schools 

12.16 12.82 B: what do you think 

13.49 18.23 A: well i uh when i was holding i was thinking of a number of you know the the topics about 'em like uh 

18.64 24.03 A: violence and zero tolerance policies came to mind and i was just reading something online about 

24.46 27.07 A: grade inflation as i graded some college papers 

27.40 30.90 A: what uh what kind of things do you think about when you think of public schools 

31.69 35.21 B: i don't i haven't really thought about it very much but the question when it said 

34.71 35.07 A: hm mhm 

35.49 38.05 B: is there something seriously wrong with public schools 

38.04 38.45 A: hm mhm 

38.72 41.30 B: i don't know that i would call anything seriously wrong 

41.54 41.96 A: hm mhm 

41.94 46.53 B: i think they do a decent job for what they have for the money they have and the things that they can do 

47.31 48.68 B: there are things wrong but 

48.68 49.02 A: right 

49.43 53.49 A: well when uh i mean i graduated in nineteen eighty seven wh- uh when did you graduate 

53.99 54.70 B: from high school 

54.75 55.88 A: yeah or yeah from or 

55.14 55.94 B: nineteen ninety nine 

56.61 57.65 A: from when i mean when 

57.75 58.57 B: nineteen ninety nine 

63.36 63.92 B: yeah 

64.72 69.51 A: now we have two kids and we're thinking about you know well wh- where to send them when they go to kindergarten and everything and 

70.15 79.71 A: uh i i i think i agree with you saying well dang it you know uh whatever problems are maybe there i got out of 'em fine uh and so a lot of it 

77.30 77.73 B: yeah 

79.92 86.36 A: is just a matter of you know the kids themselves and and if they're parents are you know going to sit on them and make 'em do the work 

86.05 86.57 B: yeah 

86.47 87.11 A: but um 

87.77 89.76 A: wh- wha- what uh was your impression from 

90.41 91.64 A: your experience there 

92.58 93.15 B: um 

93.76 94.86 B: i don't know what (( )) 

95.77 97.14 B: sorry 

96.93 97.40 A: okay 

97.61 98.19 B: i 

99.02 100.23 B: i think that 

101.90 105.86 B: i a lot of the things that i think are a problem are a result of the other kids in school 

106.01 106.42 A: hm mhm 

106.61 107.62 B: and not so much 

107.76 110.92 B: a problem with the school itself when i think about sending my kids 

111.28 112.25 B: not that i have any kids 

112.27 113.05 A: right 

112.48 114.26 B: but if i did in to a 

114.38 118.10 B: to a public school it scares me but only because of the other kids 

119.67 120.12 A: so 

120.51 122.63 B: like when you talked about violence in school 

121.65 124.90 A: e- e- e okay yeah so not so much the educational system but the but 

127.24 129.67 A: other problems that get in the way of the education there 

129.07 129.53 B: yeah 

129.95 131.09 B: yeah for sure 

130.52 130.94 A: uh huh 

131.24 132.65 A: well so what do you think about the uh 

132.96 138.07 A: i mean i remember when i was in high school ge- picture if you will this happening in two thousand three 

138.44 138.88 B: hm mhm 

146.73 153.41 A: and you'd all put your names on there and kick in you know five dollars or something and then when the game began you received your assignment and it was a hit 

160.57 162.92 A: then their hit assignment became yours 

163.23 168.34 A: until eventually you know only two assassins were left and then one of them got the other and then the uh the winner 

168.95 179.68 A: got all the remaining money and i i got picked off on like the second day as i walked out of my english class but i mean can you im- but i was you know i actually had velcro in my my jacket with a water gun in there 

179.89 184.19 A: and eh every time i think about actually doing that these days it's almost oh my go 

183.25 185.28 B: that is really really scary 

185.16 190.82 A: yeah so how fast would someone like that be just kicked out of school in an a heartbeat these days 

190.43 190.89 B: yeah 

192.22 193.39 A: it so i think zero tol- 

193.52 195.65 A: zero tolerance policies are um 

196.93 198.10 A: k- kind of the wrong way 

198.22 199.10 A: to go about 

199.87 203.76 A: wh- whatever they're trying to do here you know when kids get kicked out for bringing 

204.54 210.09 A: uh you er er there's like an exacto knife that they forgot about in their glove compartment and somebody finds it and they 

208.27 208.68 B: yeah 

210.26 212.55 A: they get thrown out i mean did that happen in your school any 

213.14 215.35 B: um a little bit i think my school 

215.99 222.95 B: my school was really tolerant about stuff like that i know things that happened that people got warning slap on the wrist for all the time 

218.33 218.67 A: hm mhm 

223.11 223.60 B: like 

225.12 225.62 B: i don't know 

225.73 226.22 B: i think 

226.84 228.39 B: it just depends on the school system 

228.80 229.56 B: for your (( )) 

229.94 230.27 A: hm mhm 

229.99 233.15 B: cause i think my school system could have done better but then i hear of people who have 

233.67 235.20 B: a pocket knife on their keychain 

235.85 236.47 B: and they get 

236.93 238.10 B: kicked out of school for it 

238.22 238.63 A: hm mhm 

238.38 239.91 B: it's just ridiculous so 

240.02 242.76 B: if they're going to do something like that they might as well make it universal 

244.22 246.40 A: so make it universal in other words um 

247.70 251.32 A: i mean go for it all the way eve- ridiculous cases and all just to make sure that 

250.73 251.88 B: yeah if they're going to 

252.00 254.08 B: do it for ridiculous cases and if they're going to 

253.66 254.01 A: hm mhm 

254.47 255.89 B: actually decide what 

256.30 259.87 B: is worth kicking kids out of school for and what's not then 

260.14 262.45 B: i don't know just make it so it's even for everyone 

263.30 266.89 B: because i think the opinion on that could be a lot different depending on the school system 

267.01 267.40 A: hm mhm 

267.27 269.23 B: i don't think it's a problem with schools in general 

269.97 270.95 B: in the united states 

271.94 272.80 B: and some go 

272.99 275.60 B: too far one way and some definitely go too far the other way 

275.65 276.02 A: hm mhm 

276.37 276.72 A: well i mean 

277.29 284.64 A: to me i mean when i hear about 'em going too far it seems like it always arises from them they're they're they're blinded here instead of these these policies that they've set out themselves 

285.24 285.68 B: yeah 

285.25 286.14 A: but are you saying that that's 

286.34 287.08 A: um i mean that 

287.54 293.16 A: despite those that that this the best way to implement a zero tolerance policy or or some sort of you know policy on weapons in school 

294.35 294.72 A: hm mhm 

295.13 296.15 A: and where was your school 

296.63 297.49 B: in new mexico 

297.63 300.58 A: uh okay so it mi- mi- mine mine was in houston so 

300.37 300.91 B: okay 

300.79 301.08 A: um 

302.39 303.34 A: hm well 

309.99 312.19 A: and so of course i i've been infected with uh 

312.95 317.79 A: some of his views and his on this is the the very hard line um you know civil rights 

318.26 320.02 A: point of view saying that you know you you 

320.16 320.66 A: um 

320.81 325.62 A: you got to have oh you know probable cause and uh you know don't don't try to 

325.77 326.28 A: um 

326.76 329.45 A: make everybody suffer because of the few people who do wrong 

330.18 331.87 A: and so i kind of have a hard time 

332.45 336.33 A: with some of these but wi- with the policies that just uh are so um 

338.11 338.88 A: yeah so 

338.53 339.40 B: so strict 

339.58 344.56 A: trick- so uh what do you call it you know all or nothing uh you know uh uh as i say you know zero tolerance 

345.13 348.84 A: uh i've read i mean i've read a lot of new principals saying well the fact is that they work 

349.03 352.93 A: and you know they have to be that way because as soon as you let it slip a little bit then 

353.28 361.51 A: then you immediately open yourself up for discrimination lawsuits you know well so and so brought this and you didn't kick them out but my kid is mexican and you know 

361.65 365.07 A: you got kicked out and it's like so uh 

366.64 367.16 A: hm 

367.28 370.42 A: you know what kind of solution would i propose for this here 

370.01 377.90 B: i don't know because i think when i think about i think yeah everyone needs a chance that's really ridiculous how how they sometimes go so far with 

375.61 375.98 A: hm mhm 

378.60 383.86 B: i you know like if someone having a pocket knife at school but at the same time when i think of when i was in high school 

384.63 386.62 B: i remember one day i was in an art class 

386.98 387.84 B: and the kid 

388.06 390.72 B: behind me made a comment about the girl sitting next to me 

390.74 391.12 A: hm mhm 

391.37 394.21 B: and she grabbed a knife out of her backpack and started chasing him around the room 

394.91 398.30 B: like it was totally scary and i think 

398.29 401.16 A: that's what you that's the kind of case we need it for yeah you know 

398.41 400.60 B: you know if someone's got a pocket knife 

400.70 404.44 B: yeah and if someone's got a pocket knife in their backpack and that's what their going to do 

404.80 405.54 B: and i think 

406.03 408.85 B: i don't even know if she got kicked out of school which is really scary 

409.44 409.76 B: but 

410.18 412.53 B: i think of sending my kids to school and having 

412.99 416.63 B: if it was tolerant about things like that i would be so scared 

416.97 417.41 A: hm mhm 

417.25 417.96 B: because 

418.34 419.22 B: it was just it was 

419.64 420.30 B: crazy 

420.46 421.60 B: it was completely crazy 

421.85 423.10 A: yeah so like yeah 

422.13 424.25 B: so i think if we're going for safety 

424.40 424.96 B: then 

424.46 425.79 A: like the princi- sorry go ahead 

426.30 428.90 B: oh no (( )) think that if we're going for 

429.28 430.89 B: safety on that issue 

431.53 435.23 B: then if why not take it to extremes cause you can warn people you can say 

435.16 435.58 A: hm mhm 

435.58 438.06 B: don't bring this kind of stuff to school be really careful 

438.98 449.07 B: but at the same time i look at it on the other hand and think wow i had a pocket knife on my keychain and a nail file you know and so i don't know it's really hard it's hard to find where a line is 

449.20 450.55 B: so i don't know what a solution would be 

450.80 457.38 A: well basically if we're talking about safety go ahead and go to extremes and just make sure that no matter how extreme it is make sure you're doing it consistently 

457.53 459.64 A: uh across th- so there's no room for 

457.55 458.42 B: yeah 

460.13 462.76 A: uh you accusations of bias or uh 

462.87 464.43 A: unfairness or whatever 

464.14 464.93 B: absolutely 

465.24 467.25 A: okay well now that we've got that settled 

466.21 468.20 B: well and to make sure warn everyone 

468.52 471.11 B: of what the rules are what they're getting in trouble for 

469.69 470.08 A: hm mhm 

471.43 472.34 B: so the innocent people 

472.71 473.89 B: if they take care of themselves 

474.12 476.13 A: so much greater what uh awareness 

476.48 478.42 A: policy to cut down on the 

476.54 476.90 B: hm mhm 

478.69 480.03 A: those getting caught in the uh 

481.28 482.21 A: caught unawares 

482.71 483.11 B: hm mhm 

485.08 493.37 A: well i guess that sounds reasonable let's see in the uh couple minutes we have left what should we take on next uh how about let's see uh drugs or uh 

489.49 490.45 B: um 

492.47 497.63 B: drugs drugs would be good there are a lot of drugs in my school when i was in high school 

493.60 494.52 A: okay okay 

496.66 497.99 A: there there were plenty of them then or what 

498.35 499.11 B: oh yeah 

499.71 501.85 B: definitely the drug dogs came at least once a week 

502.40 502.75 A: wow 

503.03 505.09 A: (( )) never got actually you know 

503.07 503.76 B: (( )) 

505.66 508.35 A: searched for drugs as a at least not to my knowledge 

508.86 511.69 A: but uh i know there was one guy that would sell these little you know 

512.07 513.23 A: dots of whatever 

517.20 517.89 B: really 

523.50 524.81 B: wow yeah 

538.97 539.37 B: uh huh 

544.10 547.46 B: you don't think i'm going to take that do you
