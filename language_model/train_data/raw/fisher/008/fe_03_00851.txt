40.23 46.20 A: okay well let's see what's the topic do we think something's wrong with public schools the school system 

57.28 63.47 A: money is very short these days and you know people say one thing but when it comes you know coming out of their pocket 

63.33 65.29 B: yeah yeah when it comes to paying taxes uh 

65.39 67.63 B: it's different 

76.96 78.57 A: when they get older and you know 

78.80 79.19 B: yeah 

79.02 81.49 A: can't compete for jobs can't get into college and 

82.56 84.70 A: so what's your take on it 

84.57 87.27 B: yeah yeah what do you see as the problem 

101.30 101.76 B: yeah 

104.34 108.89 A: a lot of the teachers are bored or either they don't care anymore so 

108.93 113.44 B: i think sometimes i agree i think teachers are bored and i think teachers are also uh 

114.47 116.00 B: uh how do i put this 

116.25 119.30 B: they're resources to help a child 

119.71 121.69 B: as far as discipline goes 

121.46 121.96 A: yes 

121.79 129.08 B: seem very limited because parents aren't willing to take responsibility for their children so when something goes wrong 

129.40 131.20 B: they automatically blame the teacher 

130.95 140.97 A: oh yeah well i i definitely agree with you there i mean there's no accountability you know with the parents and but i'm i also think they're (( )) with the unions that some of these 

134.99 135.41 B: yeah 

145.94 146.41 B: yeah 

151.09 161.00 A: starts with funding you know i think that every time that i i know you can't have mismanaging of funding but you know you always hear about what we can't afford this we can't do that we can't do this so 

160.04 161.23 B: yeah that's true too 

161.14 171.14 A: you know but parents you know definitely i think you know and that's i think you're right that's primarily the biggest problem cause i think if they're are involved with you know their child early on 

170.72 171.12 B: uh huh 

175.35 178.01 B: right and the teacher won't have the same issues that 

182.77 183.28 B: yep 

187.74 188.18 B: yeah 

191.00 200.80 B: yep that's right i've seen that happen i've also my brother in fact has a problem writing and he was asked to compose this is like high school he was asked to compose an essay 

201.40 203.54 B: and my dad helped him write it a little and kind of 

203.69 206.52 B: read it before it re- went in and my dad 

206.60 208.98 B: guessed that it was probably a c or a d 

209.24 210.12 B: piece of work 

210.52 212.31 B: and it came home with an a on it 

212.51 216.60 B: yeah so he goes in at oh sorry go ahead 

212.52 214.33 A: (( )) 

214.45 216.03 A: i guess that 

216.13 221.48 A: i guess that if chagrined that uh what he perceives to be a d is someone else's eyes is an a huh 

226.88 228.18 A: ok 

230.75 236.09 B: i told my son this was bad work and you give him an a and now he doesn't trust me and now he thinks this is a work 

236.24 237.22 B: cause it was d work 

237.49 240.06 A: what was the teacher's response out of curiosity 

238.79 240.54 B: the teacher said 

240.72 242.94 B: most students complain when their 

243.17 244.78 B: children get bad grades 

244.94 245.51 A: ok 

245.34 256.73 B: or most parents most parents complain they said most parents complain when their students get get bad grades so i'm surprised that you're even in here talking to me is basically what the teacher said 

246.44 248.47 A: most parents complain yeah 

259.91 260.98 B: yeah 

268.15 268.62 B: uh huh 

272.64 273.39 B: did he 

278.16 278.56 B: yeah 

278.63 279.07 A: and 

279.15 288.70 A: the amount of people would show up even though it it was a minimal number he still show up and that's what i'm saying man he need that type of effort you know both both ways you know 

286.20 286.88 B: that's right 

287.79 294.29 B: there needs to be some care on the part of the teacher as well as as on the part of the parent like you said professional integrity is a big deal 

293.77 297.00 A: yeah so it's it's a big thing but uh 

297.11 306.25 A: you know i is i with everything man there is no easy answer i guess you could talk to a hundred people and get a total a hundred different opinions about what should be done 

305.73 306.67 B: yeah i agree 

306.45 307.98 A: so i don't know 

307.79 309.34 B: i agree i don't know i

436.94 443.36 B: my oldest is almost four and we're looking at the public school system and we're looking at our ability to teach 'em at home 

438.82 439.39 A: ok 

443.91 444.55 A: oh ok 

444.39 448.08 B: and we're we're seriously consider considering teaching him at home 

449.16 455.66 B: because we think we can do a better job than the not than the teachers necessarily but than the system 

454.37 455.07 A: yes 

455.65 465.53 A: what's the policy with (( )) references to like you know home schooling is it like uh a certain i mean uh i'm won- i guess after completion do you have to take some type of 

465.80 471.53 A: uh test as a kid child to make sure that it's up to standard or is it that's kind of interesting i've always heard 

470.81 471.32 B: yeah 

471.69 473.19 B: it varies based on state
