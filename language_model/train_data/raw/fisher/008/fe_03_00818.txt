9.70 10.99 A: tricky topic 

11.31 12.02 B: time travel 

12.12 13.96 A: really makes you think uh 

13.37 14.07 B: yeah 

14.72 16.31 A: is there something you would change 

17.81 18.45 A: gosh 

19.31 19.96 A: how about you 

20.50 21.86 B: yeah i think 

22.20 23.87 B: i don't know i think i would change the way i 

23.98 25.77 B: i've taken care of myself over the years 

27.06 28.33 B: cause i'm a diabetic so 

28.68 34.84 A: uh oh you know that's a yeah that's a good one i know uh i'm my uh i have a sister that's diabetic and i'm sure she would too 

34.85 35.30 B: yeah 

35.53 36.08 A: um 

36.15 39.52 B: i'm not always the the best one what i eat and stuff like that 

39.43 42.63 A: yeah that that's a good one i um 

42.81 44.15 A: i probably would 

44.71 48.99 A: i never finished school i went to college a couple years got sick of it never finished it um 

48.52 48.96 B: hm mhm 

49.97 54.00 A: so i probably would do that that would be one thing i'd have something to fall back on once my kids are grown 

54.12 54.58 B: yeah 

54.86 55.52 A: um 

57.18 57.89 A: uh 

58.21 61.01 A: uh you know my my home life was great growing up 

61.28 61.81 A: um 

62.28 63.84 A: i don't i really there's nothing 

64.30 71.07 A: as a young child that i think i would change uh i probably did a few things maybe uh in my early years that maybe i uh 

71.55 73.33 A: could have been a nicer person or you know 

73.45 75.45 A: didn't make fun of that person or something 

75.75 78.72 B: yeah i think i think i would have uh treated my parents differently 

80.01 80.76 A: yeah yeah 

81.20 82.61 A: hindsight huh 

82.17 83.20 B: yeah 

83.13 83.94 A: but uh 

83.31 84.61 B: they say it's twenty twenty 

84.46 85.73 A: yeah isn't that the truth 

86.23 88.09 A: yeah i mean honestly i i 

89.35 94.17 A: i think if i had the choice i wouldn't do it though i mean if i had the choice to relive anything i don't think there's anything 

95.19 96.07 A: probably 

96.79 99.05 A: uh a major thing that i would have to go back for 

99.65 102.03 A: personally with time travel i think i'd rather go forward 

101.90 102.41 B: yeah 

102.67 104.52 A: i think that would be kind of cool but uh 

105.24 106.93 A: i don't know i think um 

107.18 110.39 A: like i said a career move would probably my biggest thing because 

110.70 114.76 A: although my kids are still young i i have nothing once they're done to fall back on 

115.64 116.97 B: well i have a six year old so 

117.04 118.66 A: oh d- that's my youngest 

119.10 121.08 A: that's my youngest i have four but um 

121.58 122.67 B: i only have the one 

121.76 122.22 A: but yeah 

122.85 123.47 A: oh really 

123.53 123.83 B: yeah 

123.68 125.28 A: that's busy enough huh 

126.44 127.39 A: yeah i uh 

127.77 131.43 A: even i think probably some of my my raising you know i have four and they're all close 

131.74 133.79 A: and i i would not change that at all 

134.37 134.91 A: um 

135.97 138.22 A: but i haven't always been the most patient with four 

138.75 142.64 A: i do my best but there are some times probably i over reacted or 

143.28 143.86 A: um 

144.16 144.70 A: probably 

144.23 147.75 B: well i can imagine cause i'm not always the most patient with mine and i only have one 

146.84 147.15 A: yeah 

147.59 150.80 A: it is it's very tough well my oldest is 

149.90 151.62 B: but see mine is a._d._h._d. so 

151.81 157.89 A: oh oh well that's that's i i don't have that i have i have a very active son but not uh 

158.43 162.47 A: i i i've seen er i have some neighbors that have the a- a- a._d._h._d. and 

162.68 164.04 A: that's tough that's tough to deal with 

165.05 165.62 A: but uh 

166.27 169.55 A: yeah i think there are definitely some things i think i i could probably be a 

169.72 171.20 A: a better mother at times 

171.88 172.40 A: um 

172.00 173.10 B: i think we all can 

172.88 177.60 A: yeah yeah you have those moments where you say things that you out of madness that you don't mean to 

177.72 180.15 A: um that kind of stuff i think i would probably change 

181.24 184.91 A: but i just there's really it's it's a tough one i would rather just go back 

185.78 191.69 A: i would rather go back in time to visit some you know relatives that are no longer with us to see my grandfather again 

191.54 192.00 B: yeah 

191.85 192.58 A: um 

192.70 194.30 A: not so much to change anything 

194.91 195.42 A: um 

195.60 196.50 A: minor things 

197.27 198.84 A: but would be nice to be able to 

199.97 202.81 A: to see them and visit with them again 

203.11 203.58 B: yeah 

204.93 209.68 A: huh ten minutes of this huh this is a little tougher than i thought 

209.43 209.98 B: yeah 

209.98 211.01 A: is this your first call 

210.87 214.37 B: this is only the second one of these things that i've done so i'm not exactly sure of the 

212.98 213.73 A: oh you've you 

214.57 216.31 A: you've had another call though you've done this 

215.88 217.05 B: yeah one have you 

216.83 218.57 A: okay no i just actually signed up today 

219.63 220.65 A: so this is the first 

220.01 221.91 B: you just signed up today and you got your first call 

221.60 222.78 A: yeah isn't that something 

222.72 224.56 B: wow i didn't get my first call until like 

224.83 227.14 B: i might have been signed up for like two weeks before i got my first call 

226.83 231.16 A: oh my no i signed up about i think i signed up somewhere between twelve and one this this afternoon that's it 

231.41 232.15 B: wow 

231.82 234.90 A: and we're eastern time so yeah yeah within four hours 

235.14 235.79 A: so um 

235.94 237.44 A: but yeah it's kind of an interesting 

237.62 239.32 A: an you know interesting concept 

239.87 240.40 A: um 

241.10 244.26 A: very tough to stay on top wa- was your other topic any easier 

244.96 245.57 B: actually it was 

245.68 249.61 B: pretty much the same thing but the the person i spoke to was like you know 

249.76 250.10 B: i guess 

250.53 252.69 B: she said like we were supposed to do like one thing and then she hung up 

253.32 255.58 B: but i don't i don't know exactly what we're supposed to do 

255.43 262.50 A: oh no i you're supposed i know you're supposed to talk ten minutes um a friend of mine did it and she um actually she just got a call today and they after 

263.04 265.33 A: after i guess the ten minutes they actually um 

265.97 269.53 A: she got like okay you have thirty seconds to say goodbye and then that was the end of the call 

269.76 270.19 B: huh 

270.18 276.44 A: so i think you have to do like the whole ten minutes and i and i don't know what they're analyzing but it's very hard to stay on topic for ten minutes of 

276.55 277.47 A: um you know 

277.63 279.13 A: of something that's not quite 

280.10 281.96 A: i'm not sure what else we could say you know 

281.53 283.13 B: well i've got another one for time travel 

283.20 283.62 A: did you 

283.92 284.46 B: how about 

284.75 287.35 B: for us to be able to travel into the past 

287.49 287.98 B: change 

288.40 291.34 B: the things that are happening as far as the war and stuff like that 

290.82 292.12 A: oh well that's true 

292.23 294.81 A: oh that's true 

295.17 296.38 A: that would be a big thing 

296.45 296.92 B: yeah 

297.05 297.61 A: um 

298.10 300.75 A: or even you know even like this shuttle thing you know 

301.17 304.05 A: go back and and and say hey check that 

304.37 306.38 A: check that underneath that wing or whatever 

305.71 306.29 B: or even 

306.48 308.17 B: even before the tra- the shuttle 

308.32 312.48 B: tragedy what about going back and and before like el- nine eleven 

310.68 311.90 A: nine one one 

312.30 314.89 A: yeah boy yeah that would be that would be now uh 

315.17 320.17 A: a very useful and amazing thing oh gosh all the stuff we could stop 

320.29 322.71 A: i mean i don't think you can avoid all tragedy but the big ones 

323.04 325.08 A: yeah that nine one one boy i don't know 

324.83 332.95 B: that i think must be the maj- the most major since i've been alive i mean i was born right around when the vietnam thing was going on but i wasn't old enough to be able to 

328.05 328.44 A: yeah 

332.75 333.84 A: right under yeah 

333.23 334.50 B: to comprehend it 

334.24 340.42 A: right right yeah this is probably our biggest the the alfred b murrah was a big one but the nine one one was definitely 

341.06 344.59 A: um huge i mean that's the one we won't forget cause even some of the 

345.32 345.97 A: you know 

346.14 347.67 A: assassinations and stuff 

348.51 351.50 B: yeah but things like that things like that have to happen 

348.56 348.81 A: or 

348.94 349.88 A: little foggy 

351.27 351.67 A: right 

351.68 352.51 B: along the line 

352.55 352.91 A: right 

353.05 356.00 B: but i mean for nine eleven it was like such a major loss 

356.03 356.45 A: yeah 

356.55 358.83 B: and the people that were taken were not even 

359.14 359.86 A: no that was 

359.42 360.11 B: key players 

360.35 361.59 B: or anything like that in the 

360.47 360.77 A: that 

361.16 361.53 A: yeah 

362.21 366.49 A: i don't know how you would stop something like that though you know you know who believes you hey i kn- i have this 

366.88 369.01 A: i have this insight i know what's going to happen 

369.54 374.15 B: maybe you would go back to the person who actually gave the warning to the the government in the first place and told 'em 

373.50 374.22 A: that's true 

374.43 375.14 A: that's true 

374.64 375.02 B: you know 

375.38 377.84 B: make them have the power or the ability to 

378.30 380.15 B: to make their warning stand out more 

380.21 380.53 A: right 

380.82 382.36 A: right that that would be a good one 

381.21 382.99 B: make it be make people pay attention more 

383.56 384.18 A: that's true 

384.98 387.81 A: that would be an amazing thing to be able to do oh my gosh 

388.91 390.01 A: what a gift that would be 

390.80 395.10 A: yeah that that would be probably like i said that yeah that would be much more uh futile much more um 

396.32 401.02 A: uh worthwhile i guess because like i said my life doesn't need too many changes but 

397.87 398.28 B: yeah 

401.70 403.00 A: if you could do that for the world 

403.93 407.07 A: that would probably be the first one i think that would be the first one i would do 

407.77 408.86 A: too many people uh 

410.03 411.23 A: too many people were hurt and 

411.37 414.86 B: and because especially like all those children stuff like that that were born like without 

413.81 414.24 A: yeah 

414.98 416.73 B: their their parents because of the 

415.33 415.88 A: parents 

416.98 421.02 A: i know that's awful yeah that's that's just an excellent uh 

421.56 422.80 A: an excellent idea 

423.69 426.32 A: there's probably like you know numerous other ones we could 

426.51 427.25 A: we could avoid 

426.78 431.91 B: well like you were saying about the uh the (( )) with the uh social security building or whatever 

431.81 432.22 A: hm mhm 

432.59 435.23 B: that that was big but i was still i don't know 

435.52 436.90 B: i guess i was still too young to 

437.92 439.11 A: to really appreciate that 

438.79 439.23 B: yeah 

439.56 441.46 A: i do remember that one because i was home with 

442.15 445.42 B: well i remember it being on t._v. and i remember seeing the pictures and 

442.34 443.46 A: one of my older kids 

445.17 445.62 A: yeah 

445.59 447.43 B: i even remember the trials but 

447.89 451.48 A: no i i sat in front of that t._v. for that one too uh that was awful 

452.27 455.79 A: and i i remember her- yeah i even think for that one 

456.84 462.38 A: some people were getting this one was much more the the nine yeah the nine one one was much more upsetting i mean people were 

462.62 467.62 A: brought their kids home from school and and all that i don't think the alfred p murrah was that 

467.81 469.78 A: that big of a deal but um 

470.25 471.33 A: but it definitely was 

472.07 473.08 B: oh like i had worked 

472.58 472.83 A: uh 

473.44 474.85 B: um on the night shift and i 

474.95 475.59 B: before 

476.01 476.91 A: oh (( )) 

476.56 479.16 B: and i had come home and i was like just getting to bed 

479.44 481.53 B: and my husband came and woke me up and told me about the uh 

481.81 482.81 B: plane hitting the towers 

482.78 483.27 A: uh 

484.09 484.57 B: and 

484.70 486.38 B: that i sat in front of the t._v. for 

486.78 489.30 B: and i collected all the papers for it and everything like that 

489.59 491.56 B: but since then i haven't for any 

491.69 493.36 B: any in fact even the challenger shut- 

493.48 494.27 B: the challenger 

493.50 493.95 A: right 

494.47 494.85 A: no 

494.51 495.04 B: tragedy 

495.61 496.50 A: i didn't either 

495.62 497.91 B: i haven't sat in front of the t._v. for the whole thing 

497.75 498.09 A: right 

498.60 504.16 A: no yeah i re- that nine one one i actually didn't even know it happened until i think i was on with my mother on the phone and and 

504.74 508.15 A: and we were talking and she's like do you have the news on and i was like no 

508.36 511.61 A: and i think i think i actually only started watching after both planes hit but 

515.90 516.48 B: yeah
