1.53 3.59 A: [lipsmack] hello oh 

2.06 3.09 B: hello 

4.46 5.43 A: go ahead 

5.27 7.58 B: (( hello go no go ahead go ahead mhm )) 

7.31 9.05 A: ah my name's rochelle 

10.48 11.93 B: [lipsmack] ah i'm chris 

11.48 12.52 A: hi 

13.75 15.63 B: (( [cough] [sigh] )) 

14.97 18.21 A: do you have any strong feelings about affirmative action 

17.83 22.90 B: not not particularly i was kind of hoping they'd pick the video game topic today [mn] 

22.27 27.16 A: yeah i [laughter] it would have been nicer a lighter topic [laughter] 

26.70 33.30 B: right um i don't really have a whole lot of knowledge on this particular issue to be honest with you 

32.66 34.12 A: (( [laughter] really )) 

33.54 34.87 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

36.45 43.83 B: ah not sure exactly i know it has something to do with with quotas and what not based on um [lipsmack] ah 

41.29 42.56 A: right 

44.37 51.73 B: either either racial or gender or or any sort of protected class but other than that i'm not really sure how it works [cough] right mhm 

48.80 50.20 A: right 

51.00 62.80 A: mm well i mean as a woman i guess i guess if you were to think about it i don't think i should really be given preference over a male if he's equally suited for the position 

63.29 68.13 A: i mean i'm positive i've probably been discriminated against 

68.32 71.21 A: in the workforce i mean sometimes maybe 

71.49 74.29 A: because someone was a male and they thought 

74.42 88.04 A: perhaps ah he would have been better suited and but then people discriminate because of your looks or your weight or your ah maybe you have children and they don't want children and i think there are so many different forms 

88.26 90.51 A: of discrimination that 

90.70 96.68 A: you know wh- where would it end do you know what i'm saying like where would you would you have quotas for everything 

94.12 94.95 B: yeah 

96.77 100.46 A: i mean [laughter] i think 

98.31 104.11 B: right right do you ever feel like ah do you ever feel like you've been discriminated against because you were 

100.78 101.70 A: (( [mn] [lipsmack] )) 

104.59 107.11 B: in a certain cat- category or not or 

107.47 112.43 B: or perhaps you were better qualified but there should have been something in place yeah right right there'd be a lot of hostility for sure right [mn] 

112.27 118.84 A: um no because i feel that had people been forced to hire me 

119.04 125.95 A: i think that politics would have gotten me in the end i mean i think if you're not really welcome some place 

125.92 134.45 A: in in a particular environment that you probably wouldn't be happy there or that there'd probably be continual 

134.50 137.19 A: road blocks in your way or 

137.36 138.34 A: you know 

138.41 140.64 A: i wouldn't feel comfortable 

140.73 143.35 A: if i wasn't really welcomed 

143.94 152.36 A: you know i think that there's so many i mean there are corporate you know every everyone feels different in different work places i mean i'm sure 

152.96 159.31 A: you know i don't know what your experience is but there are some companies that you know where you mesh better with certain people and i think 

159.43 162.18 A: there are others where you just don't and 

162.82 165.11 A: it kind of works out that way 

164.81 168.63 B: yeah yeah i don't guess i've ever been in a situation where 

165.39 167.11 A: (( you know mm mhm )) 

169.39 172.54 B: i've been [lipsmack] there was one job where 

174.23 186.32 B: maybe i felt a little bit out of place but there wouldn't wasn't anybody any sort of particular class everybody was white everybody was male ah this was when i was working on shore so there were there was exactly one female 

180.53 182.21 A: mhm mhm 

185.95 187.00 A: mhm 

186.34 190.40 B: ah on one of the rigs that i was on other than that but 

188.47 189.92 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

190.40 194.68 A: so was it a male industry is that why they were all males it was a male domin- 

193.83 197.33 B: pretty much it it's very difficult for them to integrate 

197.10 198.69 A: why is that 

197.43 198.16 B: um 

198.37 205.25 B: ah prob- mainly because the rigs are so small because [cough] when you're dealing with something like like the military for instance 

204.58 206.48 A: oh right right 

205.85 218.28 B: um you've got large numbers of people and it's very easy relatively easy to to take one yeah well this particular barracks and make it male and this particular barracks and make it female but if you're on an oil rig 

214.60 217.14 A: mhm right 

218.48 220.08 B: you're talking 

220.44 223.87 B: twenty to sixty people at the most 

224.83 236.69 B: and the one the one area they've been able to integrate is is in the company that i worked for was ah they had a safety rep position that individual had their own room with their own 

227.83 228.88 A: mhm 

236.95 249.39 B: bathroom whatever shower or whatever you want to call it so it was very easy for them but but to have them the rest of the living quarters converted it's just not cost effective it's not practical on on such a small installation 

245.96 246.86 A: (( mm mhm )) 

249.00 249.89 A: (( mhm mhm mm mm )) 

250.37 254.98 A: [mn] well i could see that you know it's funny 'cause i worked for a military um 

250.57 251.72 B: other than that 

256.09 263.98 A: [lipsmack] well they built military they built ships for the military and um it was mostly males i mean they were mostly males there 

259.02 260.49 B: (( oh okay sweet )) 

264.02 265.53 A: but um 

266.38 273.02 A: i mean i don't know what their policy was on hiring i i th- i just felt that it was basically male because 

273.16 276.33 A: those were the um there was one woman there 

276.54 282.33 A: who was working in the same department as me and i think there was only about three women on the whole floor 

282.77 284.54 A: and um 

284.87 292.45 A: i don't know whether there was lack of interest on the part of other women why there weren't more women but i didn't feel discriminated against at all 

292.24 295.02 B: [mn] were you all in an office environment or were you all out right right 

293.78 296.99 A: yeah it was an office environment i felt very comfortable 

297.01 299.14 A: i didn't feel uncomfortable so 

300.16 308.63 A: i don't i mean i i think also there are certain fields that females tend to gravitate to more than males and 

308.87 312.17 A: vice versa and i i i just um 

312.69 315.82 A: (( [mn] i don't know i think i i don't )) 

316.60 317.85 A: i don't feel that 

317.97 322.13 A: i think that people really want something they usually can they can get it 

321.83 323.44 B: yeah 

322.46 324.60 A: in this day and age i don't think 

325.49 326.36 A: that it 

326.38 330.37 A: (( that there are that many barriers any more i mean when i was off shore i didn't i didn't see any )) 

332.16 335.33 B: so that s- pretty much seems to be ah 

335.82 340.21 B: kind of the way things are across the board i mean mhm towards 

340.80 341.59 B: (( the )) 

341.59 342.54 A: (( hostility mhm )) 

341.89 343.18 B: idea of having women 

343.29 348.73 B: on the rigs you know as long as they could do the job was was the predominant attitude [mn] um you know 

344.01 345.58 A: mhm 

349.91 355.40 B: i can't really think of any other job of course i've i've done a variety of different environments and i can't really think of anything 

349.95 351.51 A: mhm 

354.08 355.42 A: yeah 

355.55 356.87 A: (( yeah i mean you know )) 

356.30 357.28 B: than 

357.64 361.72 A: i see you know the the just the recent space 

361.81 363.11 A: launch 

363.16 367.18 A: you know as tragic as it was it was a mix of different types of people 

367.38 369.60 A: so i don't think 

370.45 378.45 A: that there you know are the barriers that there used to be i think that you know people are finding a way to get what they want 

374.05 375.51 B: (( mhm )) 

379.10 381.88 A: without having to meet quotas i mean [lipsmack] 

383.51 386.51 A: i don't really yeah 

385.01 388.63 B: do you think there's anything any type of work environment where 

388.66 392.50 B: a certain category of individuals shouldn't be in that environment 

392.76 394.11 A: what do you mean by that 

393.96 394.97 B: um 

395.48 397.87 B: [cough] like for instance ah 

398.13 399.11 B: (( i don't know )) 

399.36 402.37 B: i guess i guess i can't really think of anything either um um 

401.78 402.64 A: (( mm )) 

405.47 410.31 B: like say if somebody felt that women shouldn't be off shore that that kind of thing 

410.35 411.39 B: um 

411.74 412.75 A: well 

412.00 416.09 B: or or for instance women women going into combat and you you have mhm right 

414.68 417.56 A: i know well i i don't know because i 

417.66 421.65 A: they always say well you know in israel women serve in the army 

422.07 423.93 A: (( [lipsmack] and [mn] )) 

424.36 426.06 A: i don't know 

426.82 430.66 A: really what capacity it's based serve fully or not 

430.88 431.78 A: but 

433.71 437.70 A: i don't know i mean i i really haven't 

438.15 440.06 A: thought about that 

439.81 441.76 B: honestly that's the only thing i can 

441.32 442.71 A: yeah 

442.06 444.72 B: think of that that anybody bothers to say look this 

444.30 445.72 A: mhm 

445.24 454.37 B: group isn't welcome [lipsmack] from what i understand women women still aren't officially allowed but every now and again somebody sort of shows up 

448.18 449.22 A: mhm 

454.38 464.19 B: in a situation you know a woman goes into the army she ends up in a situation you know of course when you go into the army you're trained as a soldier i don't think they train women 

457.03 458.58 A: mhm 

464.37 475.17 B: not to fight [cough] and i think situations arrive where ah a female ends up in a combat situation and and she's a soldier she has to do what she has to do so 

473.20 474.34 A: (( mhm right right )) 

475.18 476.50 B: (( i don't know mhm right )) 

475.81 481.28 A: but is it but today with the ah you know all the technology 

482.25 483.18 A: (( i d- )) 

483.32 490.19 A: well i think women will be able to serve in a much more expanded category of combat 

490.46 496.36 A: i don't know about you know physically when they get to the land and it's more 

497.13 503.45 B: there's there's much more somebody to sit at a consul and push a button is that the 

497.61 499.00 A: front line 

502.76 507.17 A: yeah i mean right i mean if you're using technology and 

508.55 510.78 A: behind the scenes or 

511.38 518.65 A: up to a certain point where you're not really you know face to face where you're almost like down at the um 

519.72 521.76 A: already after you're 

522.07 523.30 A: you've you know 

523.42 535.47 A: like say we went to iraq and we were suddenly you know when you're doing it from above from the air and sea it's not the same as when you're in on land and you have foot soldiers 

525.43 526.21 B: (( [noise] right )) 

535.33 540.31 A: and i think you know when you get into the foot soldier category i think it might be a little different 

540.41 542.94 B: do you think that 

543.75 546.22 B: the military ought to 

548.19 559.13 B: give the more desk orientated jobs to like say if they want to prohibit ah say if they want to prevent women from actually going in in as ground troops they don't want women 

552.43 553.83 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

559.79 563.04 B: on the ground with a rifle the same as men 

561.65 563.00 A: mhm 

563.26 564.98 B: should they give 

565.30 571.22 B: more of the desk jobs the the consul sort of button pushing jobs to women do you think 

570.53 572.77 A: well that might be discrimination though 

573.39 576.25 B: ah i think that kind of comes back 

575.31 576.39 A: mhm 

576.30 583.23 B: to the area towards controversial you've got just as many women want to join the army as men for instance 

578.57 579.58 A: right 

584.38 586.18 B: maybe there's not as many 

586.28 588.29 B: many opportunities 

588.19 589.10 A: (( mm )) 

588.90 591.68 B: i don't think so i'm sort of playing devil's advocate here 

591.02 592.60 A: i know well 

591.77 593.17 B: now [laughter] 

593.29 594.46 B: (( trying to keep this going )) 

593.34 597.29 A: i don't i don't know i mean i've never really thought about that i don't 

597.72 599.89 A: ah i don't really know i like you know
