145.86 147.08 B: and maybe 

147.32 149.22 B: lived in a place where it didn't snow 

149.96 150.44 A: hm 

152.67 153.11 A: pardon me

172.13 180.51 B: right well we get we get snow all the time here and it's cold and i don't like it i think i would have chosen a place where it is warm all the time 

172.94 173.34 A: yeah 

177.07 177.51 A: mhm 

180.95 181.40 A: mhm

227.12 227.55 A: uh 

227.39 228.44 B: so 

230.66 234.07 B: um i think something else that i would have changed is um

241.73 242.13 A: bills 

242.34 243.74 B: yeah bills you know

245.31 246.92 B: high mortgage payments 

247.83 248.27 A: hm 

247.85 248.49 B: um 

250.70 254.67 B: uh vehicle payments that you didn't realize that you couldn't handle later 

252.49 253.03 A: mhm 

254.94 255.37 A: mhm 

257.01 257.65 B: and 

257.75 258.52 B: maybe put 

259.02 260.97 B: kids in to private schools 

261.33 261.77 A: mhm 

261.74 263.23 B: public schools are horrible

266.63 267.30 A: thing to know 

267.61 268.20 B: yeah 

270.95 273.23 B: maybe chosen a career like 

273.36 275.12 B: a doctor or or 

276.76 278.97 B: lots of things you could change 

279.59 281.05 A: that is good 

283.08 284.86 A: well if you are a doctor you 

284.97 288.33 A: definitely don't have that much time to to think about anything 

289.05 290.53 B: yeah so 

291.37 291.79 B: uh-huh 

295.21 296.42 A: so um 

295.86 298.00 B: i guess just make better choices 

298.75 299.69 A: yeah that could be 

299.94 300.50 B: yeah 

303.62 303.99 A: (( -cause )) 

304.18 306.91 A: the investment of lives is 

307.05 307.65 A: big 

309.94 310.36 B: yeah 

313.99 314.74 B: i think uh 

316.36 318.10 B: school is a big part of life 

318.33 319.03 A: mhm 

327.07 329.74 A: well for me um

336.75 338.39 A: for the past five years 

339.73 342.24 A: but before that i'm kind of upsetting 

343.09 347.00 A: and if i can go back to the time even earlier 

347.57 350.18 A: i guess i would just change my 

350.57 352.71 A: personality or the way i 

353.40 355.19 A: i show off myself 

355.19 355.78 B: yeah

361.41 362.40 B: there is a um 

363.75 364.80 B: lots of things that 

365.12 366.56 B: could have been changed like 

367.86 369.46 B: maybe less wars 

369.75 370.27 A: mhm 

374.06 376.13 B: less fighting less arguing 

376.71 377.19 A: yeah 

386.21 390.34 B: well we've been doing this for nine minutes i think it was the requirement was ten 

390.62 391.49 A: oh okay 

392.04 396.83 A: yeah counting the minutes that is good

426.85 427.55 A: should i change 

429.81 430.36 A: well 

430.79 431.50 A: probably 

431.61 432.50 A: change 

432.91 435.23 A: the laziness of myself 

435.45 436.06 B: yeah 

436.18 439.27 A: to be more like a motivated person 

440.46 447.21 A: doing like more aggressive to whatever i'm doing at right now 

447.25 447.78 B: right 

453.55 457.51 B: or got get scholarships and stuff for like free college and 

455.99 456.61 A: yeah 

457.81 458.42 A: mhm 

459.63 460.07 A: yeah 

460.55 462.76 A: well (( )) does help a little bit 

462.97 463.61 B: yeah 

464.04 465.30 B: are you going to college 

465.78 467.82 A: i went for the college already 

468.06 468.72 B: oh yeah 

468.67 471.53 A: yeah but it was really tough for me to find a job 

471.61 472.43 B: oh is it 

472.75 473.10 A: yeah 

473.39 476.79 B: well even if you go to college it is still tough to find jobs huh 

476.58 477.29 A: yeah 

477.46 478.78 A: i guess there is so many 

479.13 481.54 A: like college students out there right now 

481.66 482.45 B: yeah 

482.25 482.98 A: so and i 

483.32 487.31 A: think maybe if you go for a h- a little bit higher education 

487.91 488.46 A: that will be 

488.57 489.84 A: better maybe 

489.92 490.54 B: yeah 

491.00 496.46 A: yeah i wish like something like a master degree or well not talking about a p._h._d. because 

496.59 498.90 A: i know i would never ever go and do that 

499.96 501.44 A: but the maximum i can probably 

501.53 503.30 A: probably um a master degree 

503.77 504.35 B: yeah 

504.85 507.30 B: yeah i never went to college and i wish that i 

507.50 508.20 B: would have 

508.49 508.90 A: mhm 

509.90 510.32 A: i think 

510.51 511.25 A: um maybe 

511.34 512.99 A: people can get uh uh 

514.00 515.76 A: a state grant or something 

515.91 516.58 B: yeah 

517.60 518.88 B: well there is lots of uh 

519.73 520.18 B: uh 

520.71 525.05 B: financial aid that you can qualify for but still you got to pay all that back
