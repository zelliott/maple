12.58 14.39 A: i have not no 

13.54 16.39 B: (( okay [laughter] )) 

14.90 17.32 A: (( okay i haven't either so [laughter] oh goodness i've got to think about when )) 

23.88 27.08 A: (( they said time travel i was not thinking of my life i thought [laughter] i thought )) 

26.40 28.37 B: let's see [laughter] 

27.56 28.96 A: (( they meant another period so )) 

29.66 31.43 B: oh gosh 

31.39 35.99 A: hm yeah i i know [laughter] i can't really think of anything that i would actually go back and change 

35.56 41.47 B: yeah i'm feeling similarly which i feel glad to feel that way [laughter] 

39.27 40.41 A: uh-huh 

41.30 45.53 A: i mean i would love to t- to go back through time travel 

44.88 46.99 B: yes yes 

45.64 49.67 A: but i i i would not want to change anything in my life 

49.11 60.19 B: yeah i feel the same way because now i have three young kids and i'm you know i'm often making the decisions of things they're going to be involved with and oh my goodness [laughter] 

57.05 59.27 A: mhm and i have five 

59.34 61.24 A: [laughter] 

60.21 62.49 B: what age ranges are yours 

61.81 67.58 A: um i have a seven year old nine year old twins an eleven year old and a thirteen year old 

66.82 74.70 B: oh my goodness [laughter] you're really busy then wow mine are one three and five 

67.65 69.46 A: [laughter] 

70.28 72.32 A: what about what ages are yours 

74.14 75.56 A: oh okay 

74.85 81.39 B: so so they're littler but yeah it's kind of strange to be on the parenting side because you need to be making those dec- you know 

80.86 82.65 A: yeah that's true 

82.13 87.76 B: so yeah i know i keep i mean the one's in ballet now and i had never done anything like that so 

87.37 98.87 A: yeah i mean y- you know what now that i think about when you mentioned ballet because i used to be a dancer i u- u- used to do ballet and jazz and maybe the only thing i would do was instead of um 

92.49 93.86 B: (( oh )) 

98.82 109.87 A: if i could go back n- n- and change something instead of even though listening to my mom you know was a lucrative career in ah communications 

107.15 108.15 B: uh-huh 

109.21 110.44 B: (( yeah )) 

109.94 113.94 A: i would have wanted to dance that was my one thing 

111.76 113.74 B: oh okay 

114.05 116.24 B: now how long did you stick with it 

116.21 120.44 A: i st- i even danced in college from when i was little 

116.26 117.82 B: or did you do it for quite a while 

118.89 120.06 B: oh wow 

120.35 131.36 A: and in college i actually wanted to go on to you know new york and try out for shows and that too but that you know she was like you know dancing is just a hobby 

124.73 126.44 B: oh wow 

130.93 132.10 B: (( yeah )) 

131.22 137.65 A: it's not something that you do as a career you need to get a career and do something with that so 

135.68 137.43 B: right oh 

137.58 145.78 B: well you could probably sympathize with her now because you know if one of your kids did [laughter] you'd probably be feeling the same way like hm are you sure [laughter] 

141.53 142.89 A: [laughter] 

144.24 150.71 A: you know i would i probably would feel the same way but i don't think i'd be so adamant and stop them 

146.96 148.21 B: yeah 

149.04 150.12 B: yeah 

150.17 154.42 B: yeah because you'd want them to follow their dream and yeah 

152.32 154.78 A: right right and i think that's like 

155.03 167.56 A: the one thing that i i would have loved to have done because i still love to dance even now and every time there's a broadway show every time there's a movie with dancing you know i'm watching it so 

159.24 160.19 B: (( yeah oh )) 

163.33 164.79 B: wow 

165.17 166.66 B: yeah 

166.87 169.26 B: oh that's awes- have you seen chicago 

169.35 175.54 A: no as a matter of fact i'm going this weekend to see chicago my kids were sick for the past two weekends 

170.55 173.94 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] that's awesome )) 

174.73 176.29 B: yes 

175.89 176.97 A: (( so )) 

176.39 182.40 B: yeah you probably don't get to see too many movies with five children [laughter] 

179.55 186.27 A: no i really don't and my friend asked me if i wanted to go and and sh- she asked me last weekend but the children were sick 

185.65 188.29 B: (( yes [laughter] )) 

186.34 195.76 A: so i am going this weekend and i can't wait to see that yeah every time there's a movie that comes on like that i want to see it so i probably would have changed that 

188.95 191.29 B: oh well that's neat 

193.24 194.36 B: (( yeah )) 

195.16 197.55 B: yeah well that's interesting 

197.31 199.03 A: [laughter] 

198.39 207.71 B: [laughter] i know i'm trying to think if there's anything i would change but i don't know i g- i guess i would have thought it would be neat to take a little bit of some kind of dance lesson because i was always so klutzy 

207.25 208.66 A: mhm 

207.73 212.50 B: [laughter] and that's kind of why i have my daughter in it so hopefully she'll avoid that but 

211.77 223.31 A: actually my mom put me in it because i was very shy as a child and she put me in it to bring me out of my shyness because i would not talk to anyone and was really really shy 

215.17 216.81 B: oh okay 

219.62 220.64 B: (( yeah )) 

222.72 224.39 B: and do you think it worked 

224.10 227.44 A: oh yes definitely definitely 

224.68 225.83 B: okay 

226.05 230.60 B: because my daughter's shy too and that was another kind of hope that yeah yeah 

228.61 239.69 A: mhm yeah definitely it it it definitely works because it got me to open up and you know it was something i loved doing once i got in it you know so yeah 

234.93 235.86 B: yeah 

236.86 238.02 B: yes 

239.07 243.60 B: oh that's neat well you probably did make a good decision though following your mom's advice because 

242.71 256.18 A: i did like i say it was very lucrative in mean in in in the career you know i- i- it has lead to other things you know but it it was not my dream you know how you still have your dreams 

249.29 250.22 B: yes 

252.83 254.75 B: yes yeah 

255.50 257.14 B: that's true 

256.36 261.43 A: you know buried with- i- i- you know inside and you still think about it and 

259.02 260.19 B: (( yes )) 

260.67 271.42 B: well maybe you could still do something [laughter] you know [laughter] did you ever see oprah i saw on oprah a month or so ago about a lady who always wanted to wa- be one of the rockettes or something 

263.21 265.12 A: [laughter] 

270.51 280.71 A: oh that's right i saw that i saw that and i could so sympathize with her and i thought oh wicked i would have loved to do that just even for a day [laughter] 

272.18 273.46 B: [laughter] 

274.25 275.25 B: (( yeah )) 

275.33 276.63 B: [laughter] 

277.14 282.04 B: that's what you reminded me of [laughter] oh gosh 

281.42 287.58 A: i remember seeing that because i was like oh i would so love to do that for just for a day even 

282.91 291.61 B: yes it seemed really neat [laughter] well you ought to write to her you never know [laughter] 

288.93 292.30 A: (( [laughter] )) 

291.75 295.40 B: oh gosh that would be neat [laughter] 

293.58 299.92 A: yeah but ah no th- that's the only thing i could think of but anything else i mean ac- you know it's been 

300.10 303.35 A: every thing's fallen in line when it should have 

302.63 309.11 B: that's wonderful yeah i feel pretty much that way too and i feel blessed that way because you know you hear of so many people with regrets and 

308.71 309.96 A: mhm 

309.12 316.48 B: various things they'd like to change but i've always yeah i try to be real specific in the decisions i make for my life 

310.54 312.14 A: mhm that's true 

315.90 323.41 A: i do too i do too i was i was always slow actually about making a decision until it was well thought out 

316.82 317.73 B: (( yeah )) 

320.76 321.96 B: uh-huh 

322.55 324.63 B: yes and that's a good thing 

323.44 329.25 A: you know because i mean my mom always saying you never jump into anything so 

327.71 336.91 B: yes now do your kids seem to be i mean they're older yours are some of them are old enough that you can start seeing th that they seem to be doing the same thing or are they more 

335.89 348.15 A: now my older son is is very he's very um he's al- he's a lot like me he takes the time he thinks before he does something and he already knows that he wants to be an engineer 

341.98 343.01 B: okay 

343.52 344.53 B: (( yeah )) 

347.67 351.89 B: oh well okay well i married one of those so [laughter] 

349.98 357.10 A: oh really [laughter] and so he's taking technology in school but yeah he he's very um 

354.93 356.31 B: okay 

357.16 368.04 A: determined to do what he wants to do and everything is well thought out he doesn't jump into anything without thinking it through so it's now the next son the second one he's the 

363.04 364.29 B: uh-huh 

367.86 377.31 A: exact opposite he jumps into any and everything without thinking [laughter] about the consequences or anything 

369.21 370.52 B: yeah [laughter] 

373.43 376.38 B: (( [laughter] )) 

377.06 378.67 B: oh gosh 

378.06 381.58 A: and um then the girls my twin girls are 

381.84 382.83 A: kind of 

383.66 388.38 A: a little bit different one's one's more gutsy than the other one 

387.56 388.78 B: mhm 

388.60 401.73 A: and the other one she's more she's more low key and she thinks things through more but she's much more outgoing where the other one is more gutsy but she's still a little bit more reserved and shy 

395.78 396.87 B: okay 

401.05 402.32 B: (( ah huh )) 

401.92 409.65 A: so you know that's an interesting combination and then my youngest son he- he's another one he's just you know go home and off 

407.06 407.91 B: [laughter] 

409.19 410.05 B: wow 

409.54 421.44 A: you know but he's a type too but you know you ever met one those people that ev- anything they set out to do they accomplish he's that type of person he can do any and everything he sets his mind to 

416.06 416.88 B: yes 

418.73 420.43 B: oh that's great 

420.79 421.82 B: yes 

421.34 427.30 A: you know you teach him something new he gets it like immediately he never forgets it 

423.35 424.36 B: uh-huh 

425.38 426.71 B: oh wow 

426.93 440.10 B: that's great well it's nice that your youngest could be that way [laughter] because you're probably tired by now [laughter] [laughter] oh i'm just thinking wow you were very brave t- especially after the twins to have another one 

429.49 430.58 A: mhm 

431.10 435.20 A: yeah that's oh that's so true [laughter] 

439.56 450.03 A: yeah well you know the first two were planned and the t- and the twins well we thought were going to be the third one was planned because we we spaced out their ages everything 

446.25 447.40 B: (( yeah )) 

448.59 451.00 B: yeah oh that's smart 

450.27 457.01 A: and then i got pregnant with twins and we're like okay twins there is no twins on either side of the family 

456.25 459.52 B: i was going to ask yeah oh wow 

457.31 458.56 A: yeah no 

458.84 468.54 A: like where did the twins came in at now the last one we just we got caught with [laughter] one christmas i know exactly [laughter] when he was conceived 

466.90 469.23 B: oh that's funny 

468.45 474.57 A: [laughter] he was like a chis- he was our christmas present [laughter] 

469.61 473.09 B: but probably at that point you were so tired it's like yeah 

473.58 483.29 B: [laughter] throw caution to the wind [laughter] but you haven't done that again have [laughter] oh how funny 

475.25 477.92 A: [laughter] yeah definitely 

478.68 481.18 A: oh no no no not after that one 

481.87 490.91 A: mhm that was it the twins we- were a surprise enough an- and to have the fifth one come along too and the twins were still in diapers 

483.40 484.61 B: gosh 

490.25 494.54 B: oh my word 'cause how much space is between the twins and your youngest 

491.00 492.99 A: [laughter] 

494.13 497.99 A: there is actually um tw- no ex- 

498.03 500.35 A: yeah twenty months between them 

499.11 499.89 B: oh 

500.17 504.37 B: gosh bless your heart [laughter] yeah that's close [laughter] 

504.65 507.71 A: yeah there's actually twenty months between them 

506.44 513.66 B: wow so does it get easier as they get older or just different or does it get harder [laughter] 

510.28 511.16 A: (( a- you )) 

512.45 518.38 A: know what yo yo- actually with your five year old ah you're going to start um 

515.85 516.83 B: (( yeah )) 

518.27 521.89 A: for a couple of years you're going to see a really easy flow 

521.43 522.37 B: yeah 

521.78 528.15 A: aft- but it starts about six because they're a little bit more independent they want to be independent 

524.20 525.41 B: okay 

526.10 526.98 B: (( yeah )) 

527.97 538.28 A: they start doing stuff and they become much more helpful and y- y you know you kind of breeze i'd say from about six to nine years of age it's really not that bad 

535.65 536.74 B: (( yeah )) 

537.56 538.31 B: oh 

538.31 548.65 A: then ten comes along and i don't know what happens at ten you know they say pre teens i think it starts at ten 'cause ten they start thinking about pre teens 

539.63 541.16 B: (( [laughter] oh oh )) 

544.11 545.31 B: yeah 

547.89 549.37 B: uh-huh 

548.93 556.19 A: and you start seeing a little bit of a different trend and then you have to put a whole different hold them and slow them down 

554.10 555.03 B: (( oh )) 

555.77 559.00 B: gosh yeah i'm not looking forward to that 

558.07 564.19 A: yeah now my teen- the thirteen year old has really not given me any problem he he's you know ah 

561.86 562.56 B: (( [laughter] )) 

563.55 567.96 B: although he sounds like a real self disciplined kid if he's going to be an engineer and 

565.47 576.60 A: he is he's very i don't have to say do your homework i mean he does sports homework everything and everything is done i don't have to get on him too much now i can foresee problems with the 

569.81 570.98 B: (( yeah )) 

576.45 587.53 A: eleven year old already [laughter] yeah you know he just he goes when he gets up in the morning he's on until he drops at night
