109.45 110.45 A: in a christian home 

111.72 112.42 A: that uh 

112.53 114.05 A: their lives might be better today 

114.58 115.01 B: yeah 

115.45 117.11 B: what kind of home were they brought up in 

117.69 120.17 A: well i mean you know they were brought up in a good home 

120.21 120.59 B: mhm 

121.17 121.65 A: uh 

122.20 123.34 A: their father was kind of 

124.02 125.14 A: demanding 

125.69 126.79 A: uh controlling 

128.28 128.90 A: and uh 

129.20 129.80 A: but then he 

130.38 132.09 A: was killed in a car wreck when my 

133.28 135.65 A: my baby was just only eight years old 

137.10 137.80 A: and uh 

139.26 142.76 A: maybe that might not have even happened you know if if things had been different 

142.85 143.32 B: yes 

146.17 146.77 A: my my 

147.06 149.00 A: my oldest one he's the only boy i've got 

149.77 150.02 A: he's 

150.15 152.04 A: he's kind of controlling and demanding 

152.83 154.90 A: he's like his father because that's the way he's brought up 

155.28 155.70 B: yes 

159.12 160.76 A: i'd just like for him to have a better life 

162.02 163.85 A: and i i pray every day you know that 

165.11 165.77 A: that uh 

166.07 167.09 A: they do get a better life 

168.36 168.92 B: yes 

170.14 171.61 B: do you think they might eventually 

172.34 173.10 B: begin to 

173.39 175.57 B: attend church more regularly like you 

176.43 176.93 A: oh 

177.81 178.41 A: one of -em 

178.58 178.94 B: yeah 

179.97 182.09 A: one of -em i have real hopes for that she'll 

183.07 184.45 A: she'll get in church my son 

185.97 188.67 A: he's he's too much like his father i doubt that he'll ever 

189.35 191.24 A: be in church but that's what i pray for every day 

192.52 193.11 A: and uh 

193.41 194.38 A: my oldest daughter 

195.18 196.11 A: i live with her 

197.00 198.35 A: and her husband's real 

198.52 200.05 A: demanding and real controlling 

200.61 200.94 B: yes 

201.16 201.79 A: and uh 

202.07 203.34 A: as a result she doesn't 

204.28 209.17 A: she's in the same situation she doesn't go to church and she doesn't do this and she doesn't do that and i tell her you know 

210.15 210.49 A: that 

211.56 212.63 A: i think if she would 

212.86 213.18 A: you know 

213.80 214.76 A: it would better her life 

217.00 219.42 A: you can't make -em do it any more than you could when they were 

220.65 221.58 A: teenagers you know 

221.52 222.54 B: certainly not 

223.14 226.81 B: yes i was brought up in a strict irish catholic home and uh 

227.73 229.14 B: my parents are very 

229.69 231.18 B: controlling in the sense of 

231.55 233.84 B: of religion and it's ending so that 

232.25 232.54 A: yeah 

233.96 235.94 B: actually had the opposite effect 

236.28 238.45 A: yeah you know i wouldn't have wanted to 

238.69 239.56 A: to have brought -em up in a 

240.16 240.55 A: in a 

241.14 242.51 A: christian controlled 

242.54 243.04 B: mhm 

243.34 244.62 A: you know but a a relaxed 

245.47 246.34 A: i know uh 

246.45 249.12 A: the church uh before i moved where i live now 

250.17 250.54 A: uh 

251.02 253.03 A: it was a nondenominational church 

253.67 254.30 A: and uh 

254.42 255.65 A: my pastor and his wife 

256.57 256.96 A: brought up 

257.08 257.74 A: three boys 

258.31 258.90 A: and a girl 

259.65 260.67 A: in a christian home 

262.33 263.01 A: and uh 

265.28 266.84 A: two three of them are 

266.95 267.58 A: are very 

268.77 270.12 A: religious an- and uh 

270.30 270.62 A: an- uh 

272.57 273.90 A: they're they're just good kids 

274.62 275.45 B: yes 

275.15 277.76 A: one of -em totally rebelled against the whole thing like you know 

278.02 278.43 B: mhm 

278.47 278.99 A: it had the 

279.75 280.92 A: opposite effect on him 

284.33 285.80 A: just some o- some of the kids are just 

287.77 288.19 A: uh 

288.79 289.18 A: i don't know 

290.64 292.45 A: seems like it it gives them a better life 

292.95 293.46 B: yeah 

296.48 296.82 A: yep 

300.34 301.24 A: so wha- what 

301.59 302.05 A: uh 

303.43 308.32 A: i don't know how long we're supposed to carry on this conversation this is the first phone call 

305.13 305.96 B: i know 

308.60 310.18 A: i at first i lost my pin number 

308.62 309.10 B: eh 

310.38 311.26 B: oh no 

311.95 314.18 A: and i couldn't find it and then i got it and then 

314.75 317.26 A: they called me a couple times and they couldn't find any participant 

317.57 318.17 B: yeah 

318.21 318.51 A: so 

320.29 320.69 A: oh 

322.97 325.40 A: how do you think it would've changed your life if uh 

326.39 327.79 A: if you hadn't been brought up in a 

328.60 329.71 A: if you'd been in a more 

329.90 331.28 A: kind of a relaxed christian 

332.66 332.99 A: home 

332.70 334.31 B: oh um 

336.37 337.62 B: i don't think i would view 

338.45 341.39 B: religion as a whole with such uh 

342.09 342.76 B: decepti- 

342.92 346.07 B: skepticism you know being um 

343.83 344.15 A: yeah 

348.49 349.70 B: being brought up so 

349.80 351.56 B: strictly in terms of religion 

352.22 352.86 B: um 

353.44 355.46 B: i always had had very 

355.98 359.74 B: you know curious questions about some things and um 

358.90 359.15 A: yeah 

361.62 362.27 B: it was just 

362.45 363.46 B: religion was just 

365.14 365.65 B: uh 

369.73 370.02 A: yeah 

372.04 373.11 B: did what you were told and 

376.73 377.46 A: yeah 

377.56 378.21 B: but um 

379.40 380.12 B: i have 

380.24 383.74 B: i've gone a couple times with some other friends of mine to a less 

384.50 385.22 B: strict uh 

386.10 387.23 B: religious services 

387.53 387.79 A: yeah 

387.56 388.25 B: and um 

389.61 390.18 B: i think if 

390.85 393.40 B: if i had been brought up that way then it would've been 

393.61 393.86 A: yeah 

394.01 394.86 B: much better 

395.03 396.86 B: i don't know if i would've you know 

397.18 399.04 B: attended regularly or changed 

399.29 401.97 B: m- you know what i would've changed but um 

402.52 403.05 B: i think i'd 

403.27 403.81 B: have a 

404.13 406.10 B: a fair view on things 

406.13 406.41 A: yeah 

408.27 409.48 A: i uh i think you're right 

411.29 411.97 A: some kids 

412.84 415.67 A: if they're brought in too strict of a religious home 

416.47 416.83 A: they just 

417.05 418.81 A: they just rebel against the whole thing 

419.24 419.65 B: yes 

420.82 421.26 A: gives -em 

421.65 423.17 A: not a very good outlook on everything 

424.22 424.75 B: no 

425.47 427.86 B: kind of makes you think quite alone 

427.58 427.97 A: yeah 

429.56 430.12 B: but uh 

432.31 434.47 A: well i'll say some prayers for you and hope that uh 

435.45 437.37 A: that you can get into something that uh 

438.94 439.96 A: will give you a better outlook 

440.22 441.26 B: well thanks 

442.03 443.35 B: yeah 

450.28 451.39 B: so what made you 

451.92 452.74 B: start to uh 

453.51 454.54 B: attend regularly 

454.91 455.66 B: and become more 

455.82 456.29 B: religious 

457.54 457.98 A: uh 

459.94 460.40 A: about 

460.53 461.21 A: um
