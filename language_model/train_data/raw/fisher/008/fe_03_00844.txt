16.01 18.61 A: if i were offered a million dollars i 

19.64 21.86 A: and not be able to talk to my best friend 

22.53 24.49 A: i don't think i would take the money 

25.10 27.60 B: uh i agree i don't think i um 

27.85 28.88 B: would be able to at 

29.43 31.66 B: at this point in my life now 

31.96 32.83 B: if um 

34.00 34.59 B: you know maybe 

35.15 40.23 B: earlier it just you know it if it mattered that i needed the money to feed my family 

40.41 42.17 B: so forth you know it would be more tempting 

42.29 43.00 A: mm 

42.74 44.41 B: but um of course 

43.98 44.72 A: yeah i think 

45.54 48.70 A: um in most circumstance i wouldn't take it unless it was like 

49.53 50.31 A: die or need 

50.69 51.13 B: right 

52.77 53.57 A: sister was 

54.32 55.51 A: heart transplant 

55.69 56.75 A: i would definitely 

57.68 60.32 A: uh well yeah i would that would be a 

60.77 62.09 A: a (( )) consequence but 

62.87 64.80 A: i wouldn't want to lose a sister 

65.03 67.16 A: compared to not being able to talk to one of my friends 

67.87 68.32 B: right 

68.38 68.65 A: but 

69.21 69.83 A: in most 

70.14 73.20 A: most situations i wouldn't want to i wouldn't do that 

74.44 76.42 A: i don't think that's my opinion 

76.69 78.68 B: yeah well that's mine too it would be 

78.88 80.86 B: i think if if you took the money 

83.02 88.93 B: and let's say you know you had fun spending it for awhile and then you i think you would realize that hey 

89.41 90.92 B: um money doesn't buy 

91.30 92.70 B: can't buy friendships 

92.93 93.32 A: right 

101.60 102.99 A: i think that 

103.28 104.52 A: like i wouldn't i 

104.66 108.90 A: even if like i could get the money without a friend without losing a friend 

109.45 110.60 A: i don't know if i would 

111.05 112.23 A: you know it must be weird 

112.75 113.35 A: winning it 

114.08 116.14 A: not buy -cause if you earn it then it 

116.26 118.48 A: makes you feel a lot it would be a lot different 

118.52 126.95 B: right well i've always said if that i win the lottery i would want to win it without anyone knowing because everyone would treat you so different 

126.80 128.06 A: mhm oh yeah 

127.28 129.12 B: uh you wouldn't know um 

129.62 131.06 B: who your true friends were 

131.36 132.24 A: right 

131.80 132.42 B: um 

132.57 133.07 B: they would just 

133.16 138.97 B: you know look at you differently so i would and i would even try to hide i wouldn't buy a lot i don't think 

139.00 139.83 A: right i would 

140.08 142.09 A: buy a lot but like as if 

142.45 144.29 A: in the time it would have taken me to 

144.44 145.80 A: earn the money from working 

146.53 147.08 A: know what i mean 

147.11 147.68 B: mhm 

147.72 149.08 A: let it make it feel that 

149.67 152.35 A: that i'm just working really hard 

152.10 153.07 B: yeah 

153.63 154.35 A: um 

155.73 157.41 A: and so yeah i don't think i would 

158.59 162.93 A: do that i don't think i would lose my friend i know i wouldn't rather 

163.15 163.61 B: right 

163.45 164.53 A: i would not lose 

164.98 168.15 A: saying no to my best friend i just talked to her and 

168.59 172.05 A: i am in college and i miss her 

172.75 173.55 A: and so i 

174.41 176.93 A: i had i wouldn't be able to do that 

177.13 177.59 B: right 

177.62 178.47 A: that is well 

179.58 183.55 A: i (( )) it would just be out of the question no like your mother wouldn't 

184.07 184.87 A: just another 

185.06 187.53 A: a parent wouldn't accept a million dollars to 

188.24 191.93 A: if they could give up if they had to give up their child for the million dollars 

192.15 192.65 A: they wouldn't 

192.92 193.33 B: right 

193.29 197.11 A: i wouldn't give up my best friend for a million dollar i wouldn't give her up for 

198.31 198.69 A: five 

198.82 200.03 A: billion dollars 

200.52 201.53 B: yeah i agree 

201.79 202.12 A: not 

202.41 203.81 A: for anything 

204.59 207.75 A: at all that's almost almost common sense 

207.95 209.78 A: i would think anybody would think that 

210.36 217.59 B: well i do to unless like it's a you know a situation i'm not in a situation where it's life and death you know my children are well 

217.80 218.21 A: yeah 

221.98 228.01 B: i'm able to pay for their college education it's not like i have a lot of burdens but there are some people that 

228.15 228.67 B: um 

229.28 233.74 B: have never had anything in their life and they would think that that would mean happiness too 

234.45 237.04 B: so but i just don't equate money with happiness 

237.98 239.35 A: right yeah i mean 

239.98 243.93 A: it just you know would not be you get all these people who 

244.65 246.56 A: say that their your friend but they are 

246.69 249.76 A: just using you for their money they want you to pay for this and then 

250.66 253.99 A: and plus then you start your friends who you are your friends they'll start 

254.38 256.10 A: can i borrow some money and 

255.71 256.85 B: right 

256.66 258.41 A: they will start to feel that 

259.72 261.49 A: oh it's okay i can just borrow it from him 

261.91 263.84 A: or they can feel that um 

264.39 265.96 A: they won't have any 

266.67 269.13 A: like responsibility that they need to you know what i mean 

269.17 269.91 B: right 

269.72 270.29 A: and then like 

270.42 271.47 A: what happens if you'd 

271.58 273.61 A: die or you mo- move away 

274.10 275.53 A: or something and then they 

276.25 280.74 A: feel lost without you if you keep giving them money and they won't know how to go on 

280.77 281.43 B: that's true 

281.65 284.28 A: that's another way to look at it i just thought of that too 

285.26 286.05 A: um 

286.89 287.48 A: yeah 

289.00 289.42 A: think 

291.72 293.79 A: is that all we are supposed to talk about um 

293.75 296.85 B: i think so i don't know how how long are we supposed to talk 

297.29 298.90 A: um let me check i have 

299.11 300.27 A: my email here 

301.76 306.30 A: you may participate in up to three calls each call will receive (( )) a lottery 

310.84 312.57 A: i'm not sure if it says so or not 

313.05 315.23 A: however long we're supposed to talk for 

318.82 329.22 B: well i know oprah said when she um course she earned all her money but you know she said she you'd be surprised how many people that you know call that you've never heard of before 

323.20 323.63 A: yeah 

329.50 330.10 B: um 

330.32 331.79 B: i just can't imagine anyone 

333.55 336.87 B: i would never even if i had a distant relative that 

337.32 341.70 B: won a lot of money or inherited a lot money i would feel badly 

342.09 344.67 B: trying to be their friend all of a sudden or trying to 

344.23 346.51 A: oh yeah if it if i mean it was 

344.87 346.24 B: called them all of a sudden 

346.89 349.06 A: if it was like the other way around 

349.16 349.74 B: mhm 

349.77 351.93 A: like i would feel very i would feel like 

352.17 352.88 A: cheap 

352.96 353.86 B: right 

353.09 355.19 A: i think i would i wouldn't like (( that )) (( awhile )) 

355.79 356.93 A: you know i wouldn't like that at all 

356.94 357.57 B: no 

358.22 362.04 B: no that's why i said if i ever had if i ever inherited a lot of money 

362.52 364.33 B: or um course if you're 

363.50 364.97 A: try to make it hush hush 

364.81 370.93 B: yeah i would not want anyone to know and i would just you know try to really hide it and i you know of course i would i would probably 

371.30 373.47 B: you know give a lot to my children but 

373.80 374.39 B: um 

374.30 375.11 A: well i mean they are 

375.50 380.72 A: they are just going to like you more they are they are going to or they are not going to like you 

379.54 380.16 B: mhm 

380.88 384.59 A: well i mean just i know how some kids are i'm not saying that 

384.71 385.45 A: you're a bad 

386.19 388.30 A: you sound like a bad mother 

388.90 390.88 A: if however that sounded i don't know 

390.68 391.37 B: (( no )) 

391.09 391.56 A: um 

393.33 395.09 A: but yeah that makes sense i mean
