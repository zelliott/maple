18.94 22.30 B: yeah me too so [laughter] um 

22.41 26.30 B: i do- do you know what exactly we're supposed to talk about like 

25.79 36.98 A: i think we're [sigh] we're just supposed to be able to talk and they're going to be looking at maybe the quality of our voices and the effect and 'cause they keep in mind where you're calling from like i'm calling from a cell phone 

37.02 38.07 B: oh okay 

37.98 39.02 A: so 

39.59 40.50 A: um 

40.65 42.08 B: oh um 

42.98 48.07 B: [mn] what was the question do we think there's a problem with the public school system 

48.85 51.51 A: um yeah i mean it's it's i mean i 

51.60 59.16 A: if we can keep on talking for like ten straight minutes i think that'd be fine it's i don't think they're really looking at content i think they're just looking for quality 

59.06 59.92 B: oh 

60.30 61.66 B: okay [laughter] 

61.57 63.13 A: [laughter] 

61.99 63.58 B: [laughter]

64.81 65.81 A: um 

66.51 67.30 A: (( so )) 

67.93 68.93 A: um 

68.84 72.76 B: well i don't i thought it was purely based on the topic i 

72.89 78.10 B: they've been calling me for a while but [mn] if i don't like the topic i don't push the 

77.39 78.57 A: you don't go for it 

78.71 79.95 B: yeah 

78.80 79.60 A: well 

79.61 83.39 A: what interests what interests you you in the topic for this evening 

84.01 84.84 B: i 

85.08 94.32 B: well i just um i just graduated from college and i went through a public school system for most of high school but i was in a magnet school 

94.20 95.23 A: mhm 

94.63 98.12 B: so my education was a little bit different from 

98.18 109.30 B: most of the rest of the public school system you know of schools but [mn] i just based on comparis- comparing our school to the rest of the schools in the city 

109.29 113.60 B: is that the other schools leave much to be desired 

115.18 118.51 A: now was there a particular focus of the magnet school you went to 

118.33 120.44 B: it was overall academics 

120.24 121.24 A: okay 

120.61 131.81 B: we have just three i think three or four in nashville that were there's one that's um for science and technology one that's for all of academics one that's for the arts and one's for business 

131.86 133.08 A: mhm 

132.48 134.52 B: i just went to the overall 

134.49 135.77 A: academic one 

135.87 137.09 B: yeah 

137.32 147.14 A: oh [mn] the school system in ah i'm from los angeles it's it's kind of piecemeal here here you know it's it's either you have a really great school district or you don't and 

146.34 147.45 B: yeah 

147.09 155.01 A: if you live in greater los angeles you know within the actual city um they have magnet schools and they have different focuses 

155.19 163.47 A: [mn] you know it's whether or not you actually want to go into media and journalism and communications as opposed to science and technology 

163.37 174.79 A: um and i mean they just they have an incredible variety of schools available um alternative schools as well for students who just don't fit the profile of a regular high school student 

174.46 175.52 B: oh wow 

174.95 176.06 A: um 

176.16 181.56 A: and they actually have i think it's two campuses devoted to students who 

181.63 195.32 A: um it's they're for lesbian you know bisexual transgendered um you know they they they're very tiny programs but it's it's available for students who are having issues within you know their own system 

194.96 195.89 B: yeah 

195.48 201.22 A: and would feel more comfortable in a curriculum that's more geared towards their interests and their concerns 

201.37 214.32 B: [mn] i guess that's a big difference and nashville's growing but it's not nearly the size of los angeles like we don't have anywhere close to that variety of in programs and it's kind of 

212.14 213.41 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

214.43 219.42 B: limited on even being able to go to the magnet schools and you know the specialized schools 

219.26 220.70 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

219.55 220.41 B: it is 

220.76 233.53 A: well i mean i don't know it's i went to public school um and they had you know like a gate program you know it's like for for students who just um you know just through elementary school and through junior high had 

234.06 241.12 A: like an extra curriculum that they would go to or be bussed in for like you know a particular morning when w- one day a week or something like that 

236.21 237.12 B: mhm 

240.51 241.74 B: yeah 

241.15 247.15 A: that would encourage them and those are the students that tended to actually go into advanced placement courses in high school 

246.73 251.69 B: yeah we had ours was called encore but it sounds pretty much the same 

251.57 254.42 A: yeah it's everyone calls it a little something different 

254.37 255.59 B: yeah 

255.79 265.81 B: but the only thing with those here they don't they're limited i guess because of the locations they usually do them outside of the school that you actually go to 

265.78 266.63 A: mhm 

266.00 266.87 B: so 

267.36 270.49 B: they have like specifications for getting in 

271.00 276.13 B: i was on the waiting list for encore for a while before i actually ever went 

275.67 277.05 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

276.42 289.60 B: so in the meantime you know like i had teachers trying to skip me and so of course my mom wanted me to stay with my same age group so when you don't have outside stimulation you know you get sometimes kids get bored in the classroom 

289.24 290.58 A: (( [noise] yeah they do )) 

291.22 291.98 B: so 

291.25 292.26 A: (( they do )) 

293.01 295.07 B: i don't know do you have any of your own 

295.66 296.52 B: kids 

296.81 301.85 A: i don't i don't i finished graduate school last year and um you know 

302.58 304.72 A: haven't had the pleasure of having kids yet 

304.39 305.47 B: oh okay 

304.88 305.98 A: (( so [noise] )) 

305.79 309.23 B: i haven't had to go through it yet but i just had one so 

309.52 311.09 A: how old is the baby 

310.86 313.49 B: ah she's a week old 

313.42 314.85 A: oh my goodness

318.75 322.54 A: was delivery everything you had hoped it would be [laughter] 

321.91 326.17 B: [laughter] well i did mine natural so 

325.12 326.08 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

326.23 331.49 B: that was an experience but i was only in labor for f- about five hours 

331.04 332.74 A: oh congratulations 

332.16 337.78 B: so yeah i i made it okay but i can't imagine going through that for much longer 

338.20 339.26 A: well it's 

339.56 342.65 A: it's i've heard horror stories from the past you know 

343.01 348.91 A: six days and you know you're just like going no no no no no no i'm never having children 

344.26 345.66 B: [laughter] 

347.43 348.42 B: yeah 

348.72 354.20 B: i had a friend that went through i th- she did have natural and she i think she did 

349.04 349.95 A: (( you know )) 

354.31 357.30 B: she went through eighteen hours of labor maybe 

356.70 357.85 A: wow 

357.79 361.01 B: and i was just i think i might have had a i am 

361.32 370.97 B: [lipsmack] afraid of i just am terrified of needles so i was not even contemplating an epidural but [mn] i don't know at that point i might have had to get one [mn] [lipsmack] 

363.97 364.89 A: mhm 

370.60 371.53 A: mhm 

371.57 375.98 B: but no hers went really well she was small she was only 

376.38 380.02 B: five pounds and not quite fourteen ounces so 

380.21 384.83 B: she wasn't real big i didn't have to get an episiotomy or anything so 

384.03 385.28 A: that's great 

384.90 386.42 B: mine went pretty well 

386.58 388.01 A: oh that's good 

388.04 391.58 A: you guys were i mean just you're home now and 

390.95 392.27 B: yeah 

391.69 392.78 A: having fun 

392.39 402.78 B: we had to stay in hospital for two days i think i think when everything is okay and you don't have a c. section they keep you for two days as part of [mn] normal hospital policy so 

402.03 402.99 A: mhm 

402.91 405.27 B: yeah we were there for two days but we're back home 

404.55 405.33 A: (( oh )) 

405.41 406.21 A: okay 

407.12 407.98 A: (( okay )) 

408.45 415.76 A: now th- there's a lot of options available now did you just have a birthing room did you stay in there or did you 

414.57 421.67 B: they had us in a birthing room and then once i was done and probably about an hour or two later they moved 

422.01 423.31 B: us into 

423.78 429.74 B: just like a regular well it was still i guess [mn] it was just on the other side of the hall or the other side of the little 

429.94 438.75 B: office area the birthing s- suites they call them are huge and i guess they were just they save those for delivery and then once you get done with delivery they move you 

433.83 434.96 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

436.65 437.83 A: mhm 

438.86 445.56 B: to a room that's probably about half to a third of the size it's still a decent size but 

445.00 445.97 A: (( mm [mn] )) 

445.62 449.04 B: just i guess they don't y- figure you need as much room 

449.00 450.00 A: yeah 

450.42 451.15 B: oh 

450.72 451.64 A: (( oh )) 

451.45 454.32 A: it's changed so much more last ten years since 

454.11 463.07 A: i used to nanny before i went into college and you know it was very sterile and you know you actually went into a surgery room and the like 

462.92 474.23 A: and now it's oh yeah we've been in the same room and you know we have these big wide chairs so the dads can come and sleep in and it's just like going he's doing a sleep over your baby stays in the room with you and [mn] 

467.82 469.44 B: yeah [laughter] 

474.44 487.03 B: yeah the only the first night she couldn't stay in the room unless somebody was going to be awake at all times you know somebody had to be awake but after that it didn't matter you could call in and get her whenever you wanted and 

475.21 476.21 A: so 

480.47 481.39 A: mhm 

486.74 487.62 A: wow 

487.47 489.17 B: so forth i was 

489.18 493.37 B: impressed with the security at the hospital they had um 

493.76 495.51 B: tags around their 

495.57 497.16 B: or some kind of security 

498.13 504.54 B: [mn] little device around their ankles that were wrapped around and then they had arm bands and 

504.75 515.54 B: ah or wristbands and ankle bands and they had one on you and the father too and then whenever you dropped them off in the nursery and came to pick them back up they checked your 

515.79 521.35 B: your little band to make sure the number matched or whenever you were away from them and came back together 

521.26 522.11 A: (( [noise] ahah )) 

521.70 525.41 B: they checked the little bands and the little security tag um 

526.56 527.64 B: if you 

527.78 533.52 B: if it moved kind of like away from the ankle at all i guess it alerts somebody at the front office 

533.90 535.16 A: (( [noise] wow )) 

534.74 538.25 B: and you can't walk around with them in your arms you have to put them in those little 

538.87 543.16 B: cart things that they have them in sleeping so [mn] they're pretty 

541.43 542.63 A: mhm 

543.88 547.37 B: [lipsmack] pretty strict on it i guess they've had problems in the past 

548.47 555.97 A: [noise] well you hear of horror stories of name badges being swapped and things like that and picking up the wrong baby and [mn] 

552.50 553.80 B: yeah 

556.05 557.00 A: so 

557.53 558.09 A: (( [mn] )) 

558.42 562.82 A: 'cause they all kind of look the same they all do and they all don't at the same time and 

562.03 563.22 B: yeah 

563.21 563.97 A: so 

563.68 571.44 B: well i was like i am biracial and he's quite dark but she came out looking a lot like me so she didn't look real similar 

571.45 572.60 A: mhm 

571.50 573.88 B: to most of the babies in there 

573.66 576.40 A: [laughter] she had a very distinctive look [mn] 

574.12 575.12 B: so [laughter] 

575.61 576.99 B: yeah 

576.53 578.35 A: that one's mine [mn] 

578.29 582.32 B: yeah [mn] i used to always be able to kind of look through and tell which one 

579.28 580.46 A: that's nice 

582.38 587.96 B: she's she's really light but um she still has just has her own look 

589.54 590.38 B: (( [lipsmack] so )) 

589.76 590.83 A: that's nice 

591.04 592.30 A: mm that's nice 

592.77 593.71 A: (( so )) 

595.03 598.76 B: oh where did you go to graduate school or what did you do
