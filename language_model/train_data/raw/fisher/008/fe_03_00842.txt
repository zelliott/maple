246.23 246.73 A: right 

247.44 248.13 A: that's right 

248.02 249.23 B: okay but if you're 

249.74 251.44 B: if you were living with them 

251.57 258.28 B: and what if it was an emergency what if like (( )) a tarantula spider crawling up your husbands neck 

258.16 258.72 A: yes 

258.42 260.79 B: and you couldn't tell him i guess you could 

260.92 261.68 A: write it down 

260.92 262.36 B: write it down 

261.99 262.38 A: yup 

262.54 266.53 B: or um uh now see i i i do

267.06 267.43 B: huh 

267.76 270.10 A: take something and just smack the tarantula of him 

270.24 273.85 B: yeah uh yeah you could do that but but what if 

274.02 276.76 B: mm what if it what if it was a car 

277.48 284.08 B: well you'd just have to lose the million dollars if he was about to get hit by a car and you like were across the street you know 

283.71 284.24 A: right 

284.55 285.68 B: you'd have to shout at him 

285.74 286.07 A: yeah 

286.16 287.45 B: um 

287.22 287.88 A: or you can just 

288.01 293.17 A: shout hey (( )) hit by a car i'm not speaking to you but hey you know 

292.84 299.68 B: yeah well then there's the the aspect of it says you just never speak to your breast best friend now uh now what there's different 

294.15 294.45 A: yeah 

306.77 316.63 B: what if your a a deaf person what if your hus- husband's a deaf were a deaf person or my girlfriend was deaf and you used sign language to talk to them is that allowed

313.39 315.15 A: right sign language 

315.60 316.01 A: yes 

316.79 317.51 A: i don't know 

317.72 318.45 B: um 

318.57 319.86 B: uh and 

321.49 321.74 B: i 

321.92 324.84 B: well no that probably falls under the heading of speaking 

324.52 325.53 A: yeah probably 

325.73 326.80 B: and then um 

327.02 331.98 A: (( )) we have four kids though ah i could just tell them and they could tell him you know so 

331.91 332.87 B: yeah 

339.35 340.17 A: right 

342.56 343.12 A: right 

344.89 348.62 B: and if my girlfriend knew morse code i could go i could talk to her like 

348.96 354.25 B: (( )) 

350.86 351.29 A: right 

352.94 358.17 A: right what about email is that speaking no that's not speaking to people you could send them email you could 

358.25 362.13 B: oh yeah e. email would work um you could have um 

358.32 360.07 A: instant message them 

360.39 360.88 A: yes 

362.32 363.06 B: uh 

363.27 371.14 B: right um and pretty soon they'll have such small email devices that even wireless they do now but you can text messaging you know but 

369.07 375.05 A: yeah we are we have we have uh we have cell phones with uh instant messenger and 

374.82 375.88 B: yeah 

375.17 377.10 A: a._o._l. and everything on them 

377.31 384.65 B: yeah okay now what do you do if you're in if you're in bed with your husband or if i'm in bed with my girlfriend i mean you have to 

384.76 385.99 B: you have to um 

386.72 387.46 B: um 

387.64 390.19 B: watch all the noises one makes when 

389.43 390.72 A: that's not speaking 

390.79 394.71 B: that's not speaking you're right you're but you have to be careful not to speak 

391.58 392.10 A: no 

394.20 397.38 A: you're talking to yourself 

396.80 398.20 B: yeah that's true 

399.43 400.44 B: that's true 

401.56 406.83 A: i mean that's really because that's really weird because they didn't say you couldn't see them again or anything they just said you couldn't speak to them 

406.04 407.79 B: yeah but i i have a 

407.92 410.85 B: yeah i have a feeling they may have meant that but they didn't say that 

407.94 408.55 A: you know 

410.52 412.17 A: but that's not what they said yeah 

411.65 412.29 B: yeah 

412.41 413.76 B: they said speak to your best 

413.37 417.48 A: and a million dollars is a lot of money you know i think i'd probably try to find some way 

415.30 415.77 B: yeah 

418.00 421.85 A: you know it being if it was if we're saying it was our husband and stuff 

422.17 423.27 B: yeah 

422.38 422.91 A: you know 

423.15 424.26 A: i mean because 

424.64 425.81 A: a million dollars 

426.36 427.57 A: that can buy a lot of things 

427.70 428.17 A: you know 

427.76 428.12 B: yeah 

428.63 433.42 A: i mean but if they you know changed it said you know you can't 

433.62 439.32 A: be with them you can't see them and you can't instant message them or you can't leave them notes or 

439.80 446.81 B: yeah and like dissociate with them for ten years completely that would be a different story too and yeah 

442.71 443.44 A: right 

444.22 444.88 A: right 

446.53 448.79 A: but i mean if they're just talking best friend 

448.97 449.77 A: then i would 

449.91 451.45 A: i would definitely take the money 

456.46 460.93 A: yeah you put it in the bank and get interest you know 

461.28 462.97 A: that would make up for it 

463.27 471.08 B: yeah you have to know i have to i'd have to know something about the million whether i would get it in installments so i could invest it all along you know 

468.30 469.10 A: right 

470.48 475.51 A: right if they give you a million dollars up front then you could invest then it'd be worth something 

473.15 475.31 B: yeah 

475.85 485.06 B: well this is this is amazing how we're thinking of all these um uh these different things just to fill up this ten minutes i think that's 

485.19 489.24 A: do you know what time it was when we started i don't know when ten minutes is 

489.74 491.27 A: oh no 

497.30 499.16 B: exactly how you're suppose to do this i haven't 

498.78 507.70 A: i don't know i didn't been i don't know anything about it my husband just said sign up for this thing and you can make ten bucks or something so i signed up and 

505.24 505.73 B: yeah 

506.94 507.62 B: yeah 

507.80 508.45 A: um 

510.45 510.80 A: oh 

520.95 522.61 A: do they come on the phone are they listening 

522.83 524.36 B: um no i think they tape it
