101.09 101.53 A: boy 

101.76 105.51 A: and uh i've viewed the world as a father and i 

105.83 116.22 A: take him to high school basketball and i have an uncle and and uh who has a son who plays at the local high school and i sit in the stands and i i look at the game and i look at my cousin 

116.48 120.10 A: through a father's eyes you know and i wonder you know what my son's going to be doing

131.48 132.12 A: um 

132.61 138.72 A: you know i f- i firmly believe that i'm where i am today because of all the decisions that were made along the way 

138.58 139.42 B: absolutely 

138.84 139.20 A: so 

139.45 149.96 A: you know if i went back and changed something i i believe you know i wouldn't have met my wife we wouldn't have produced this beautiful baby and uh so uh so i don't i don't know if uh 

150.59 155.46 A: if i if i would have gone back and changed anything but i don't know if that's the question i think the question was uh 

156.22 160.73 A: what what would i if uh if i did go back so um but you hit a 

160.95 162.52 A: you hit a profound one um i'm 

162.72 168.67 A: blessed enough i guess to have my my parents still alive and i i haven't really walked in the the shoes that uh 

168.81 169.98 A: that your experience did 

170.47 170.99 A: um 

171.87 176.54 A: i lost a a mother in law uh just a little over uh a year ago 

176.77 177.59 A: but um 

179.06 183.63 A: moment that we were together was a quality moment she really made an impact on my life she was a 

181.59 182.10 B: mhm 

193.12 193.75 B: right 

193.26 196.17 A: did it by example you know she didn't she didn't slap me in the face with 

194.66 195.10 B: right 

201.10 203.18 A: i'm i guess coming up with one although i've 

202.94 204.18 B: yeah i well 

203.44 204.78 A: i've made lots of mistakes 

204.97 207.72 A: but um like they got me where i wa- where i am now so 

207.82 208.77 B: i think what you had 

209.00 211.84 B: had to say though is very true um 

211.98 216.63 B: you know that there's a lot of things that i look back in my life and i'm i'm almost as old as you i'm 

216.95 223.99 B: thirty six and you know there there is a few things that i i would really like to have changed that i did or didn't do that i 

224.10 227.26 B: would have liked to have done but you're right uh who you are 

227.97 229.47 B: is is based on 

229.86 231.79 B: how you shaped your life and 

232.00 235.17 B: and you know uh i'm happy with my life now and 

235.34 237.33 B: perhaps if i had done things differently i 

237.66 239.73 B: wouldn't be as happy or you know 

239.87 241.06 A: we wouldn't be on this phone call 

241.26 243.70 B: exactly exactly true 

243.34 245.01 A: um 

244.26 244.96 B: very true 

245.27 251.64 A: i i don't know if this is on the subject matter or not but as far as going back in time i was alive when 

252.09 252.97 A: when uh 

253.82 254.84 A: kennedy you know 

258.92 259.34 B: uh-huh 

259.93 261.53 A: very intrigued with that era 

262.02 262.68 A: um 

263.04 266.50 A: and uh i don't i don't know why maybe it's because i wasn't around then but i 

266.95 269.55 A: i i would like to go back and uh 

270.72 271.26 A: and 

271.64 278.82 A: know that president more he just uh i'm intrigued with him for some reason i don't know if it's it's the charisma he had or if it's the whole 

282.03 283.41 A: uh kennedy family tragedy type time line that (( just the son uh )) 

282.16 282.64 B: right 

284.46 287.03 A: duh he had he had a uh beautiful wife 

289.67 290.89 A: white house and we haven't 

291.40 296.82 A: really know that in our generation uh a president to take office you know with small children and 

296.60 297.25 B: mhm 

298.53 298.80 A: stock 

299.41 300.66 B: that's very true that's 

300.78 301.61 B: very true 

302.31 303.56 B: uh yeah it 

304.21 314.53 B: i i have always been interested in that era too and and uh see well i was born in the wrong era i i should have been born in you know sometime in the early twenties or thirties because that always intrigued me that 

314.97 317.17 B: that era of our history um 

317.40 321.90 B: i was thinking more about the the original question and i i i wish there was 

322.04 324.32 B: such a thing as time travel because um 

325.24 325.89 B: um 

326.36 330.18 B: i i work with um our local community on um 

330.50 331.97 B: helping um 

332.19 335.46 B: do child identification kits and and stuff so that 

336.10 340.57 B: if people had a child that was um taken or something that that 

341.04 348.82 B: the police have informa- more information such as finger prints and hair samples and stuff like that and i would love to be a time traveler and go back and and 

343.94 344.33 A: got you 

348.96 352.73 B: you know these certain situations such uh as that girl in utah that 

352.82 360.90 B: disappeared you know to be able to go back in time and stand in her bedroom before she's kidnapped and be able to stop it or something that 

361.09 366.93 B: that's what i would love to be able to use time travel as a uh as a good tool almost like a a police or 

367.16 368.28 B: or something like that 

369.23 373.72 A: profound thought you had as you were telling me that i'm thinking of an article i just read about 

374.89 375.77 A: the um 

376.14 379.32 A: the the two snipers that they're currently prosecuting 

378.96 379.59 B: mhm 

379.46 389.73 A: um they they ran across they actually ran across that car they found out ten different times during all those road blocks and stuff and because they were looking for the white van they were looking for white people 

385.70 386.78 B: oh that's right 

389.30 390.05 B: that's right 

389.89 390.33 A: um 

390.52 393.84 A: but they you know they're kicking themselves that they uh they had that 

394.38 398.32 A: caprice tip early on and they just kind of put it on the side and didn't 

398.79 400.53 A: didn't pursue that and uh 

406.98 409.48 B: yeah i wonder how many uh tips 

409.81 411.21 B: police receive that are 

411.56 413.21 B: somewhat overlooked that that 

413.36 415.21 B: in reality could be the key to 

415.50 418.38 B: finding people and and solving cases and stuff 

419.59 421.67 B: but people are just human too so 

422.79 423.35 A: there was a 

423.63 428.89 A: t._v. show i don't think it's on anymore about a guy he got he would get he would get the next day's paper 

429.04 429.78 A: every morning 

429.10 430.41 B: oh that's right yes 

434.22 439.89 A: and uh it the premise sounds so cool i i never got to watch it but the premises was really cool and then he had to make decisions on what he would spend the the 

440.02 443.86 A: finding hours of the day you know how you would prioritize what he was going to 

444.30 446.73 A: save or or what he was going to change 

448.04 450.07 A: to impact the planet (( image uh )) 

450.75 452.38 A: people so that's kind of a twist on 

454.68 455.05 B: well 

455.26 455.57 B: sort of 

455.86 457.57 B: all relate to time travel though 

457.47 458.13 A: yeah yeah 

458.58 462.04 A: uh a bizarre one that i'll throw at you is is um 

462.70 465.48 A: are you are you familiar with um the roswell incident 

465.91 467.88 A: it was it was a report it was back in the 

468.09 470.40 A: forties uh roswell new mexico 

470.23 472.19 B: yes i actually um 

470.84 471.49 A: there was a 

472.42 478.02 B: i i have somewhat of an interest in u._f._o. things and my husband got me this book for christmas that totally 

472.92 473.27 A: i w- 

478.16 480.11 B: debunked the whole thing 

479.67 488.26 A: does it does it maybe i should read that because i'm i would have loved to be a fly on the wall even though there was no walls out there in the desert when all that took place 

480.22 481.08 B: yes it does 

488.39 489.52 A: to see uh ex- 

488.90 490.75 B: a coyote in the desert 

490.25 491.70 A: exactly what it was 

492.15 496.79 B: yeah that would have been interesting and and even though i've read the book and the book has a lot of valid 

497.06 504.22 B: points um i do still feel that the government is covering something up i don't know if it is necessarily aliens or 

504.06 504.40 A: yeah 

504.43 505.99 B: whatever but i'm sure that there is 

506.40 508.95 B: for the safety of our country some kind of cover up 

512.75 514.62 A: okay finally thought of one that's relevant 

515.30 515.82 B: what's that 

516.09 516.92 A: the um 

517.22 518.58 A: i would just go b- i would go back 

519.19 522.46 A: i would go back two weeks ago and and i would uh 

523.18 526.08 A: i would do everything i could to make the columbia uh 

527.75 528.25 B: yeah 

528.76 529.52 B: very true 

529.73 533.21 B: there's so many things you could do if there was such thing as time travel 

536.27 536.59 A: was it 

536.70 538.42 A: uh einstein 

538.70 540.59 A: somebody had a theory on time travel 

544.72 546.63 B: i think he yes his uh 

547.39 549.41 B: his his whole um 

549.99 555.04 B: research was based on a- another dimension but you know what eh i think if there really 

555.17 560.20 B: was such thing as time travel then someone in our future would've already come back to change things 

564.63 567.47 B: somewhere along the line they did discover how to do it it would have al-
