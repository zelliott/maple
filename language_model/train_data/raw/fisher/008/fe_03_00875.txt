0.11 1.67 B: hey this is andy 

1.34 3.34 A: hi this is denise 

3.02 4.18 B: hello how are you 

3.95 5.45 A: fine thank you 

4.94 8.09 B: good [mn] ah affirmative action 

8.03 10.19 A: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

9.46 11.70 B: [mn] um well i'm a white male 

11.63 12.91 A: [laughter] 

12.36 21.85 B: ah so i don't know that i mean th- just so you know that um my feeling is um that america 

16.26 17.56 A: okay thank you 

21.93 26.84 B: although it is a great country has lots of problems with with ah race 

26.95 34.04 B: um [lipsmack] and that ah historically ah minorities and african americans 

34.05 35.57 B: have um 

35.66 42.73 B: [mn] been kept out of the economic pie by people like me the sort of entitled white male 

43.00 48.86 B: and i think affirmative action is a reasonable way of trying to remedy a um 

43.06 43.91 A: (( ahah )) 

49.09 53.72 B: [lipsmack] a social and historical ah inequality in our society 

54.76 62.17 A: okay well that's that's pretty accurate so i mean do you agree you know that you should have it or d- do you disagree that 

61.54 63.49 B: oh i'm all for it yeah 

62.88 64.10 A: oh you are 

63.50 68.26 B: yeah no i i sort of feel like if you're if you if you're 

68.69 73.86 B: if you're white most white people have never been discriminated against and have never 

72.66 73.36 A: mm 

74.61 83.23 B: don't know what it feels like to be denied opportunities so um i totally understand how um 

76.42 78.02 A: true very true 

83.27 92.69 B: you know if you think like back in nineteen twenty six if a white guy and an african american were applying for a job the boss would have been white and he would have given it to the white guy 

92.64 96.19 A: all right ah just so you know i'm an african american female 

95.76 97.06 B: (( mhm )) 

96.66 100.90 A: so basically in nineteen twenty six you could have raped me and i couldn't do a thing about it 

100.29 101.81 B: sure sure 

101.84 112.27 B: um and i think i think that there's been this twist where the other the other kind of difficult part is [mn] america believes in in sort of um 

112.29 126.71 B: in individuality and that you should people should be free to to try to get what they want in the world [mn] so in some ways they see affirmative action as giving someone a favor giving someone a little [mn] 

126.58 131.75 B: extra than somebody else but i think that's totally the wrong way to look at it because 

128.46 129.35 A: no 

131.66 138.76 B: in if if this were a hundred yard dash white people would be twenty yards away from the start line from the finish line at the beginning 

138.67 149.49 B: and everybody else would be way far behind so affirmative action is just an attempt to even the playing field [mn] ah for for people so i don't i i mean i understand [mn] ah 

140.59 141.43 A: true 

148.90 154.16 A: so how do you feel about this whole thing this whole controversy going on about bush trying to get rid of affirmative action 

153.91 155.94 B: i dislike bush very much 

155.80 159.53 A: so am i going to see you february i mean um april first in washington d._c. 

159.11 160.32 B: i'm sorry 

159.78 164.26 A: am i going to see you on april first in washington d._c. protesting 

163.97 165.16 B: (( ah )) 

164.62 166.02 A: for affirmative action 

165.39 172.91 B: [laughter] i don't think i'll be there but but ah m- but my sympathies will be allied with with the movement um 

166.24 167.27 A: (( ahah )) 

167.95 168.86 A: oh 

171.71 176.34 A: oh well thank you so much i mean you being a white man and everything so thanks 

173.02 174.68 B: sure yes well i'm also 

174.81 187.98 B: yes well i'm also against i'm also against the war in iraq but um i think it's going to happen whether or not i protest it so but that's that's a whole different thing is i i i sometimes you know i'm i'm sor- i'm forty and i've 

187.94 194.44 B: i'm not young any more and back in my my early days i would've see political action as a viable solution but [mn] 

194.54 197.38 B: not any more it's like 

196.61 210.58 A: [mn] well i'm going to be there on april first because i mean i'm a graduate student and i plan on being a graduate student for ah you know m- many more years since i plan on getting my ph d and as an african american and as a woman i have two strikes against me 

198.82 200.55 B: well i think that's good 

206.24 207.13 B: sure 

210.27 211.90 B: right right 

210.79 216.39 A: so it's not just african americans you know who should be worried anyway and you know it should be women as well 

216.03 219.00 B: oh no i agree i agree 'cause there's a whole glass ceiling 

217.14 218.48 A: you know because 

218.83 226.44 A: so i mean just me being you know double i have two strikes against me plus i have a disability so i'm i'm a disabled black woman 

226.38 239.38 A: i mean it's going to be really difficult for me in life and i want to make sure that you know i everything is taken care of and right now that's threatened you know and and [lipsmack] i'm scared for myself i'm scared for my friends who are also 

228.87 229.77 B: sure 

232.58 233.53 B: yeah 

239.17 251.90 A: in professional schools how is that going to affect graduate students you know are we going to have that chance you know to get an education to get into the schools to get the money you know to pay for the schools am i going to have a job after i'm done with my school 

244.99 246.37 B: right i agree 

248.88 249.93 B: (( sure [noise] )) 

252.01 255.09 A: [noise] i mean those are things that we have to think about 

254.45 263.12 B: right and i think i think the a._d._a. too um is is sort of i think i think our society is big enough 

263.06 273.09 B: and strong enough to take for everyone to take care of everyone and it's not just the american dream is not just getting your slice of the pie [mn] but having sort of 

272.95 279.49 B: an equitable society in which [mn] in which everyone can be free everyone can have equal opportunity 

278.92 280.31 A: (( where are you from )) 

279.97 281.16 B: ah chicago 

281.05 283.49 A: okay 'cause you're not from the south [laughter] 

282.68 284.46 B: [laughter] no actually 

283.58 285.85 A: you're not from the south [noise] 

285.20 287.82 B: i was born in baltimore um which is 

287.82 290.31 B: which i i always think of baltimore as being 

290.20 304.27 B: more a southern city than an eastern city i think a lot of people think that maryland's on the east coast [mn] which it is but really it's more like charleston and [mn] and cities in the south it's very people there are very s- they talk slowly and they just have a very laid back 

304.15 309.07 B: opinion but um yeah i so i sort of feel like with the a._d._a. 

309.98 318.95 B: having cut downs on streets making accommodations for people having making sure that restaurants have bathrooms big enough for people to get into with a wheel chair 

318.73 330.67 B: i don't see how that like i i see that as a positive thing that doesn't mean you lose your slice of the pie by helping somebody else [mn] and i think it's the same thing with affirmative action is that [mn] there there are 

330.93 335.03 B: there has been a history of the people in power 

335.67 340.85 B: keeping opportunities from minorities and all this is is simply an attempt 

340.95 353.07 B: to um to try to at least for a while level it off and maybe [mn] you know maybe forty years from now we'll say okay things are more level things are more even but it just it just strikes me as funny that you have all these 

352.93 366.34 B: these these rich white people who say oh you know this is terrible this is against america and it's like y- what you've been doing is against america th- the ideal of america for three hundred years so i always i always find the sort of 

366.35 369.15 B: the argument about affirmative action um 

368.68 375.65 A: did you have like black friends or only white friends you haven't so you but you so you have white and non white friends 

370.71 372.65 B: i do i do have black friends 

375.03 377.38 B: yes yes i also 

376.48 378.65 A: for a long time or 

378.29 390.10 B: yeah yeah i think i mean i grew up in the in the suburbs of chicago i mean and we moved from baltimore when i was like seven and they were mostly white but um i think uh you know [mn] i just think 

390.21 392.80 B: uh i i know i mean i 

392.32 395.44 A: well did you have friends in high school black friends i mean 

393.97 400.35 B: oh yeah yeah yeah i actually i had a um a friend that i went to um homecoming dance with 

400.39 402.14 B: and she was african american 

401.81 402.99 A: ooh 

402.21 412.20 B: and she actually ended up working for jerry springer of all things but she's like a she's like a talk show um producer now [mn] but um i sort of 

405.48 406.34 A: [laughter] 

411.26 414.37 A: that must've been a big thing for you though back in the day 

414.01 424.15 B: yeah well i think it was [mn] she was yeah it was it was [mn] the ah we grew up in a very sort of liberal area so it wasn't so much like you know um 

424.23 424.79 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

425.11 426.30 B: (( ah )) 

427.89 440.84 B: the westside story or something like that but um but i think too that in just in my family of origin that my parents were were kind of ah not very good parents and i sort of know you know what it's like to 

429.56 430.51 A: [laughter] 

440.84 450.72 B: to um sort of be in a situation that's uncomfortable and that [mn] that could be made different just by changing some things around so i've always i mean i've always had the sense that like 

450.37 452.11 A: so you are compassionate 

451.49 452.94 B: yes yes 

453.20 466.49 B: um and i don- and i i think affirmative action is a a sort of realistic and and um you know governmental albeit social way of trying to address some of those issues so 

466.52 469.22 B: um [lipsmack] i also teach e._s._l. 

469.11 470.79 A: oh that's my major 

470.20 473.38 B: yeah yeah i'm i'm guessing a lot of us are going to be 

473.28 484.49 B: in that so you know i work with with lots of you know now it's it's it's not even true to say that they're minorities any more because ah the face of ah the united states is changing so much that [mn] 

484.37 485.38 B: (( that [mn] )) 

485.19 499.73 B: soon it'll be there's it's going to be like there's going to be a third hispanic you know twenty five per cent asian twenty five per cent um african american and and twenty per cent white and there won't be any there won't be any majority it'll all be you know like quarters or something 

499.68 501.38 B: (( [mn] so um [lipsmack] )) 

500.61 503.19 A: well i i mean so like 

503.29 513.38 A: so that so you're you're comfortable with that i mean obviously because um of your profession so you kind of grew up with that and so you know and you feel a a particular compassion for 

507.44 508.87 B: oh yeah yeah 

513.07 514.52 B: i i think so 

513.70 515.36 A: non white people 

514.76 519.01 B: sure sure and it's you know i think that is one of the [mn] 

519.09 532.13 B: america has some problems america has some bad things about it [mn] but it does have some basic core beliefs and and i think one of those one of those beliefs are that people are you know hopefully that you can deal with people as if they're equal to you that [mn] 

531.92 541.85 B: that you can that you're free to get to try to get what you want and other people are free to try to get what they want and you know in within reason [mn] and um you know 

533.08 533.74 A: (( [mn] )) 

541.22 548.58 A: you know i must say i am very i'm i'm surprised and maybe that's a little disturbing but i'm i'm i'm surprised to to 

548.62 559.62 A: be listening to a white man white man have such compassion for you know minorities [lipsmack] i mean 'cause you're being realistic you know also but i mean i'm i'm surprised i'm very surprised 

553.68 554.67 B: um 

556.29 557.28 B: right 

559.24 562.95 B: well i think it it kind of depends too what [mn] 

562.97 566.11 B: so what's your experience with where did you grow up 

565.71 577.58 A: i mean i grew up in in white suburbia i was born in brooklyn [mn] and my mother decided to move out to long island to make sure that we you know received a good education in particular because my parents aren't from this country 

569.16 570.08 B: okay 

574.18 575.15 B: right 

577.95 580.47 A: okay so my parents are immigrants
