13.60 20.19 A: yes it is very weird [laughter] i was just trying to scan my brain trying to think of what i could think of [mn] oh gosh 

20.36 21.39 A: um 

22.46 26.01 A: i can think of a few things ah let me just pick one [laughter] 

26.16 29.91 A: ah time travel and if we could go back the one thing that we could change 

30.87 35.95 A: [mn] well um i think i know what i would change if i could go back in time travel 

35.97 36.76 A: ah 

36.14 40.88 B: i'm trying to think if there's anything really big i would change i'm only twenty years old so [mn] 

40.36 42.01 A: oh okay 

41.10 45.24 B: i'd like to think that so many of my life mistakes are ahead of me not behind me 

44.93 47.91 A: yeah i'm thirty two so i can 

46.60 47.35 B: (( [laughter] )) 

47.73 48.78 B: [laughter] 

47.98 52.07 A: there's many there would you like me to start though would that be easier 

50.52 51.45 B: okay 

51.82 52.56 B: (( yes )) 

52.41 53.25 A: (( ah )) 

53.40 55.05 A: i would go to college 

55.39 56.36 B: (( [lipsmack] that's ah )) 

57.08 68.64 A: um i'd definitely go to college i ah put off going and now that i'm thirty two it's not quite as easy getting on the track going back to it [laughter] that's the one thing that i would change [mn] 

68.90 69.80 A: um 

70.49 75.78 A: you know instead of being older course i wouldn't mind going now that i'm older in fact i'm thinking about it 

75.56 78.83 B: [mn] you definitely should i mean i'm currently there [laughter] 

78.44 84.42 A: oh really tha- that's cool i i envy or not really envy but i admire i guess is what i mean to say 

79.24 80.34 B: yeah 

83.81 86.59 B: i'm sitting in ah my dorm room actually [mn] 

86.26 88.34 A: oh cool that's cool 

87.21 88.25 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

88.48 95.12 B: um i guess there is a few things i don't think i would have given up my part in our sixth year production when i was like [mn] 

95.39 96.45 B: eleven 

96.51 97.67 A: oh wow 

97.09 101.97 B: because i didn't want to miss my gymnastics practices but it was stupid of me i lasted only one month 

102.13 106.78 B: and i i don't think it was a smart decision and i think i would have declared one of my majors earlier 

106.82 116.91 B: instead of being stupid about it because now i've just declared it like a month ago and now it's like getting [mn] now i have to like take six classes or like take classes over the summer and stuff [mn] so 

116.92 120.56 B: you know so i was just like being thick-headed i was like the 

120.49 131.29 B: major doesn't really suit my needs even though i knew i was always going to be i should have always been an english major from the second i got here and now it's like [mn] so i ended up doing another major which i really liked but you know it's just like 

131.23 142.60 B: [mn] damn it i really should be an english major too and i am now i just declared it but like later so i have to like i'm not really doing the concentration i totally want to do in my english in the like the major 

134.70 135.82 A: that's good 

142.68 155.60 B: so it's like you know i made a few mistakes there i mean they're not like i guess fatal in the end but like [mn] you know i should really like i i'm doing like a twentieth century concentration with twentieth century literature which is really interesting but i'm more of like a creative writer 

145.52 146.41 A: yeah 

155.53 161.81 B: [mn] but it was like it was like it was like too late to do that one because i like didn't have any classes really to count into that 

155.66 157.72 A: oh wow what's that 

161.91 170.04 B: you know like like you know you can play around with like your double accounting classes so i could graduate on time [laughter] you know but still and still have the other major 

170.11 173.41 B: [mn] you know my mom's not like gonna pay for fifth year of college 

173.20 175.65 A: oh did you say you was a creative writer 

175.12 177.33 B: [laughter] i like to write so i'm doing that 

176.44 178.25 A: you know what i do too 

178.39 181.26 B: [lipsmack] yeah that's what what do you write like what type 

180.67 182.16 A: um poetry 

182.07 185.58 B: [mn] ah i like to do i'm more a prose type of person 

185.32 186.41 A: a what 

186.10 187.52 B: (( i like to write prose )) 

187.44 188.67 A: what is that 

188.41 191.42 B: like you know wr- like stories like more like 

191.54 193.33 B: prose and um 

192.63 199.27 A: oh okay well you know i've i've noticed that some of the stuff that i write and i've got a feeling we're going to get off the topic now [laughter] 

198.42 199.90 B: [mn] that's okay 

199.61 203.74 A: it is hard to stay on that certain topic though you know it really is 

202.44 204.64 B: [noise] yeah i don't think it really matters 

204.29 205.19 A: um 

205.82 211.60 A: i think um some of the stuff that i write ends up turning into like a small story 

211.99 216.58 A: and so i guess i didn't know that's what they were called so you see i'm 

215.31 225.02 B: [noise] [mn] well pr- oh i mean there's just like genres like in the within the concentration you know like the creative writing concentration in our english major [mn] there's like the [mn] 

225.38 228.09 B: creative prose creative poetry 

228.19 236.15 B: you know creative poetics like those are like types of those proses like you know like a story telling type of writing poetry is 

234.91 239.72 A: okay yeah well that sounds so fascinating i think that's great that you're doing that 

239.53 240.89 B: yeah so 

239.82 240.62 A: um 

240.69 245.08 A: i've always been i've always leaned more towards ah more of an artistic ah 

245.69 250.07 A: oh ability i'm not real goo- i'm not real technical as a person 

249.93 251.29 B: [mn] [laughter] neither am i. 

250.33 257.66 A: i'm more um it- very um ah ah sometimes i don't feel like i fit in you know it's more of a um 

257.93 267.69 A: oh i really never have fit in really [laughter] i just don't understand some you know it's not as simple for me like i said i mentioned that i wish i would have went to college 

267.31 268.20 B: mhm 

267.62 274.60 A: and now i've instead i stayed home i i've got a family i raised well i'm still raising my children and um 

274.78 278.88 A: so now i'm thinking okay they're older and i'd like to do something else 

278.93 280.41 A: [mn] and so 

280.50 287.36 A: you know and everyone else i'm like okay i guess you know it's not as simple to just go out and get a job i want to do something i enjoy 

287.55 288.44 B: (( yeah )) 

287.64 297.69 A: and um it's not real easy to try to find um you know i've got stuff i've written and i keep going over it and going over it and i'm i'm i'm my worst critic of my work 

296.50 298.90 B: well everyone is their own worst critic 

298.63 308.85 A: and you know th- and sometimes i'm like you know maybe i should change it maybe i shouldn't and um i i must have this fear because i really ought to just try to submit something 

308.74 311.95 B: [mn] well it's i mean it's very hard to um 

309.08 309.99 A: you know 

313.06 315.87 B: i mean what i mean like you c- 

316.12 317.36 B: most people 

317.51 327.17 B: [lipsmack] in terms of submitting things i mean just from things i've learned 'cause i also took like screen writing classes like that that you can't just submit things to like companies 'cause they can't take unsolicited manuscripts 

327.45 334.98 B: they're not allowed to by law like there are companies which just won't do it see like the best way to do those type of things is just submit them to contests 

334.94 341.44 B: [mn] which which do take unsolicited manuscripts so if you do well in those if you get like in the like top something 

335.18 336.29 A: yeah 

341.31 353.42 B: then you have like a better edge over somebody else you know because that's really discussing like a screen play but like it works for all types of literary submissions 'cause at like publishing places or anything they won't take anything that's unsolicited 

348.87 349.80 A: yeah 

352.69 355.85 A: i know it's like you have to be like already known you know 

355.54 356.63 B: mhm 

356.04 364.31 A: um and i've and i've been doing a lot of research on the computer of different companies um 'cause the stuff i write is more towards leans towards children 

364.42 373.39 A: [mn] and um so i've been researching like i don't want to you know and if they were happening to be accepting unsolicited there is like a couple of 'em i know that 

373.49 382.44 A: they're looking for certain things and i don't want to send something that i have in to a publisher that is totally not looking for what i've got you know i i 

382.74 384.49 A: [mn] plus i guess i kind of 

384.63 389.28 A: i don't know i ought to just do it though i really should you know if i do find one 

389.61 392.89 A: [mn] you know or like a contest but i'm kind of leery about 'em 

392.80 397.80 B: [noise] [noise] well i mean a lot of contests are quite reputable and people do actually do well from them and as i said 

398.04 399.92 B: [mn] it's really a lot like the 

400.15 402.42 B: like the resort for all people who 

402.43 414.51 B: don't have agents or something like that because [mn] because the publishing companies or any of these companies really won't take anything that's unsolicited [mn] but you know once you've like gone through a contest and like you have that organization type of thing [mn] 

414.51 418.37 B: they like you know sometimes can like y- help you out with that type of stuff 

418.14 425.23 A: yeah really well tha- well that's some great advice i'm gl- i'm so glad we're talking [laughter] and it's so neat too to find that 

425.24 429.43 A: you know that we've got that in common you know that's really neat um 

429.66 435.30 A: i've always also enjoyed i when i talked about going back to college i thought even um 

429.71 430.44 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

435.57 439.48 A: i've always enjoyed literature um as far as ah 

439.70 447.49 A: the reading part and like um plays and stories and i thought boy it would be neat to become a teacher and teach that stuff you know 

447.88 451.27 A: [mn] um so i've got a lot of areas i'm trying to consider 

451.06 451.99 B: yeah 

451.44 454.26 A: i know one thing for sure whatever i do 

454.51 456.40 A: i want to enjoy it you know 

456.03 464.95 B: well that's key i mean that's another reason um [mn] i declared a second major is i mean i believe like now i'm like going crazy i'm mean like of the week 

465.17 469.64 B: you know it's like i'm down to it i just like really have to read all the time just like 

468.85 470.10 A: yeah 

469.69 471.03 B: (( you know [mn] )) 

470.71 472.43 A: my big thing is quotes 

472.51 482.92 A: i love quotes i'm always i i've started this thing now where i find these really great quotes and i email everyone on my address book and i hope to inspire them 

483.05 490.32 A: um i ought to start up my own little thing where [laughter] um i like to make 'em i like to make people think you know 

490.57 496.24 A: and ah then hopefully they make and you know what's really neat about quotes is that everybody takes them a little bit different 

496.43 504.55 A: and i find that really fascinating 'cause i'll have i'll get a couple responses and um it's really neat and they're always good responses 

502.84 503.62 B: i mean 

503.91 511.45 B: i mean quotes and stuff like that are i think very good but they're just they're they're just like a fragment you know 

511.06 512.30 A: yeah 

511.70 512.63 B: so 

512.83 514.32 B: i mean they 

514.47 516.68 B: they do capture something but 

516.97 520.43 B: they ah isolate a lot of things out and 

520.13 521.41 A: yeah they do 

521.47 523.11 A: i guess that's why i guess 

522.84 524.53 B: and you know what and like 

525.11 538.16 B: now everyone writes in a very quotable type of way you know there are some people who are just [mn] everything they say or everything they write is a quotation but [mn] everyone writes in a very quotable type of way but sometimes there's writers who actually have a lot more to say 

527.44 528.42 A: yeah 

538.45 539.05 B: (( [mn] )) 

539.19 540.26 B: um 

540.62 541.39 B: than 

541.92 549.58 B: [mn] i don't know like sometimes sometimes if you can reduce all that every something that everyone says or all the wisdom to you like all the lines 

549.82 553.38 B: i don't think there's so much contained in that line you know 'cause i fi- 

553.86 557.32 B: i just finished reading i think one of the best books i've ever read and 

557.70 569.87 B: i think one of the things he tries to do is just try to just like [mn] you know abolish this whole idea of just like reducing things like to these trite you know platitudes [mn] 'cause he was writing about war and like 

569.89 580.53 B: he starts off with a typical platitude about war war is hell and then he just expands it and he goes into every single contradiction about war so you're expecting your typical platitude like a typical clich 

580.41 581.48 A: yeah 

580.63 581.99 B: your typical quote 

582.09 586.19 B: and then it's just done away with because it isn't that quote 

586.43 587.32 B: (( you know )) 

586.94 588.30 A: yeah 

588.37 591.53 A: oh that sounds neat i i bet that would be a good book 

590.80 594.57 B: it is if you want if you're interested it's called the things they carried 

594.90 598.30 B: (( and it's by tim o'brien it's really amazing um )) 

599.32 599.89 B: it's
