29.14 29.73 A: yeah 

30.18 31.93 A: a million dollars would be nice 

32.40 34.94 A: but uh friends don't come along every day i mean good ones 

35.11 38.07 B: right and a million dollars doesn't buy friends 

38.15 39.20 A: no it doesn't 

38.99 40.98 B: so it's better to stick with the ones you have 

39.95 40.27 A: not 

40.93 42.42 A: not true friends anyway

122.30 123.46 A: uh the day before that 

123.91 127.79 A: but i was not able to go ahead and and participate -cause i was in the middle of doing something else 

128.05 128.95 B: oh 

129.01 130.68 A: so this you know it'll 

131.08 131.95 A: happen quick 

132.59 137.14 B: yeah and i put down uh between eight and ten and they must call you as soon as the uh 

132.71 133.97 A: when did you sign up 

136.51 137.89 A: yeah they do uh-huh 

137.50 139.10 B: the time frame starts 

138.79 140.75 A: yeah i put between five and eight so 

141.38 143.89 A: they usually call around seven o'clock or a little bit after 

144.70 145.26 A: just good 

146.47 147.92 A: i don't know if they are recording this do you 

148.60 149.77 B: i think so 

149.79 153.49 A: oh are they okay well maybe we ought to stick to the subject i don't know 

150.48 150.93 B: yeah 

154.05 154.48 A: uh 

154.19 155.29 B: yeah i um 

157.21 161.54 B: i used to have a little book that had these kinds of questions in it you know for parties and stuff 

160.33 160.86 A: oh 

161.16 162.15 A: really uh-huh 

161.93 163.43 B: you could just sit around and 

163.74 170.03 B: you know if you were stranded on an island what would you want you know what book would you want with you or something like that 

165.79 166.42 A: uh-huh 

169.22 169.97 A: oh yeah 

170.20 171.00 B: but uh 

171.65 172.79 B: yeah i i 

173.04 176.20 B: a friend of mine sent me the link to sign up for this and i 

175.41 175.85 A: uh-huh 

178.09 185.96 B: was was curious you know it didn't really wasn't too explanatory as to what it was but i thought it was interesting that you know they did mention 

183.17 183.59 A: yeah 

186.36 189.08 B: you'd probably talk to people you didn't know 

189.09 189.65 A: mhm 

190.17 192.83 B: which is neat to get other people's insight on issues 

192.34 193.08 A: oh sure 

194.25 197.18 B: and interesting to hear what how other people respond to things 

194.39 194.80 A: yeah 

197.41 197.87 A: yeah 

198.08 201.40 A: and you know it it's better than getting out and getting in a group i mean you know 

201.82 202.37 A: uh 

202.67 203.03 A: seeing uh 

203.14 205.61 A: people and talking to -em together and talking to them together in a group is fine but 

205.98 208.24 A: you can do this at your own house i mean it's it's great 

207.88 208.45 B: right 

209.04 209.53 B: right 

209.45 210.63 A: and they pay you for it so 

211.07 211.67 A: it doesn't hurt 

217.07 217.73 A: uh-huh 

218.55 219.19 A: uh-huh 

220.01 220.45 A: yes 

220.20 223.27 B: i didn't want to miss the chance so 

222.26 222.76 A: mhm 

223.40 226.63 B: um i've got a little boy so i'm always home at night and 

226.35 226.82 A: really 

227.47 228.05 B: figured 

227.73 228.10 A: well 

228.28 230.54 A: i'm i'm fortunate i don't have to work yet 

231.89 232.30 A: so 

233.41 234.41 A: i mean my husband does 

235.62 236.95 A: i could stay home with the kids 

242.64 244.04 A: but anyway my answer is 

244.31 245.27 A: was no 

246.26 247.71 A: uh money is not everything 

248.20 249.43 A: i mean it is nice to have 

250.91 252.31 A: but it definitely isn't everything 

252.33 253.00 B: right 

254.07 255.57 A: i mean friends are harder to replace 

255.85 261.20 B: plus the friends that you get when you have the money will probably disappear as soon as the money does too 

259.91 261.17 A: sure uh-huh 

261.60 263.37 B: whereas you know your best friends 

263.78 267.17 B: whether you have the money or not it's always going to be there 

265.77 267.18 A: oh sure yeah 

267.85 273.20 A: they don't care about your uh i mean they care about your financial situation but they don't care if your loaded or not 

272.81 273.55 B: right 

276.24 278.74 A: anyway this is kind of interesting huh 

280.08 281.54 A: oh sound like you have a cold 

282.91 287.22 B: well i think uh just a little stuffy it's snowing here now and 

285.54 285.98 A: oh yeah 

287.08 288.76 A: oh where are you at i'm in texas 

288.57 289.79 B: pennsylvania 

289.43 290.47 A: oh wow 

290.23 290.81 B: yeah 

290.88 294.28 A: i have some relatives in arkansas i just got off the phone with them and it's snowing there too 

294.08 295.54 B: jeeze 

295.60 296.19 A: yeah 

296.83 297.29 B: it's been a 

297.69 299.50 B: not a bad winter just 

300.30 301.74 B: brutally cold and 

301.78 302.42 A: really 

302.33 303.10 B: yeah 

303.49 307.55 A: uh we've we've uh not had it too bad yet we're supposed to have some sleet 

307.99 310.96 A: i live here in south texas we really don't get much of a winter 

311.79 313.05 A: which i like you know 

313.99 315.40 B: i have an uncle in plato 

315.84 316.25 A: do you 

316.88 318.52 B: yeah he loves it there 

320.41 322.40 A: yeah this is nice we're we're right on the coast 

324.36 327.52 A: it might get we have some hot summers but the winters are mild 

327.77 328.44 B: yeah 

328.45 329.63 A: i don't like the cold 

330.25 331.82 A: i'm not not that type of person 

334.71 337.03 A: okay so we are supposed to stay on the phone -til somebody else 

337.57 343.28 B: i guess i would think that if we could hang up they would say just 

338.08 339.72 A: (( )) the computer interrupts us or 

343.98 346.21 B: say what you have to say and hang up but i don't know 

346.44 347.45 A: yeah i didn't i didn't 

346.96 347.96 B: they weren't very 

348.32 351.01 A: i didn't get an email about uh the computer 

351.27 352.23 A: coming on or something 

354.49 355.41 A: so i don't know 

358.84 359.13 B: hm 

361.98 367.75 A: i didn't even hear the question when it came on my son answered the phone he said it's a recording and i said oh give it to me you know 

367.87 369.40 A: -cause i'm expecting a recording huh 

370.69 372.71 A: but i missed two of them already i thought well i (( )) 

372.96 375.42 A: should participate in this one anyway since i have time 

377.00 378.67 A: but it was a fairly simple question 

378.44 379.13 B: yeah 

381.39 383.80 B: yeah somebody else told me they got one and it was about 

384.14 387.47 B: the stock market or something and it's one of those deals where like 

385.87 386.58 A: oh (( you're kidding )) 

387.65 391.39 B: they knew nothing about it and don't even participate and 

391.63 394.67 B: so i'm glad i got something that's just more hypothetical than 

394.56 395.63 A: yeah something 

394.98 395.74 B: factual 

395.73 396.53 A: true yeah 

397.68 398.91 A: well i've i've just started 

399.04 402.14 A: playing the stock market which i guess is not a good time to be doing it 
403.00 403.85 A: it's it's fun 

404.04 405.47 A: i do it on on my computer 

405.77 406.38 B: yeah 

406.99 408.40 A: try to make a little extra money 

410.27 411.10 A: that's basically

436.95 437.91 A: well this this 

438.33 441.37 A: question doesn't take much of a discussion i don't think 

440.70 441.48 B: no 

442.36 443.51 B: i don't think so either 

443.56 444.01 A: yeah
