5.26 5.86 A: travel to 

7.18 13.90 B: um let's see i guess it would be when i bought my house and instead of buying it here i would buy it in a different state 

14.67 14.97 A: (( )) 

15.79 16.49 B: what about you 

17.29 19.01 A: i would probably travel back

28.45 29.14 A: like 

29.40 31.77 A: elementary school really just to re-live everything

38.01 40.33 B: yeah that was the fun time i guess yeah 

42.51 44.56 A: seems like it would be a good thing just to go back then 

45.52 45.96 A: i'm like 

46.11 48.67 A: nothing really i didn't care about anything nothing mattered 

48.84 49.66 B: right 

53.42 55.07 B: but then the key would be able to 

55.17 55.90 B: to be able to 

56.01 58.86 B: stop time that you can stay in those years 

59.05 59.48 A: yeah 

61.32 62.68 A: growing up you (( )) 

65.85 67.97 A: why would you travel back to when you bought your house 

68.99 73.81 B: -cause i'm originally from new york and i went out to massachusetts 

74.39 78.34 B: to go to college and i met my husband out here and i bought a house out here 

79.15 83.52 B: but now my parents are getting older and i would like to be back in new york 

85.74 90.34 B: but i've got roots out here that i have got to deal with before i can relocate 

91.16 91.86 A: still visit new york 

92.64 94.71 B: yeah i go often but 

95.62 102.60 B: eh as they get older i would like to be able to just pop in for a cup of coffee instead of having to plan it as a whole day trip 

102.77 103.38 B: you know 

102.80 103.20 A: yeah 

107.89 109.09 B: what state are you in

115.74 116.56 A: all my life 

118.98 125.23 B: and they say say to stay on the topic but it is really kind of hard to keep talking about this forever huh 

124.60 125.22 A: yeah i know 

125.80 130.48 B: think we are supposed to talk for ten minutes is this the first one you've done or have you done others 

130.22 132.93 A: yeah they called earlier but the answering machine came on 

133.20 134.25 A: came on and i wasn't home yet 

134.45 138.59 B: yeah they've been uh leaving recordings all over my answering machine for days 

141.19 143.05 A: is there anywhere else you would travel back in time 

143.95 149.00 B: um i guess well if i could travel back to a period and then freeze it and 

149.10 152.93 B: stay there it would be the years i was in college those were the best 

153.07 153.60 B: years 

156.42 157.30 A: where did you go to college 

158.33 160.04 B: i went for two years 

160.29 165.04 B: part of the suny system in new york and then i came out here to springfield college 

165.83 168.26 B: and finished my bachelors and my masters 

170.45 172.42 B: and now i don't use any of my degrees 

172.89 181.07 B: so i guess if i could travel back in time i wouldn't bother spending all those thousands of dollars but it was fun years 

181.27 181.59 A: right 

184.76 187.80 A: i'm really just getting into the college stuff now i'm a junior in high school 

188.34 189.09 B: oh really

189.74 191.37 B: are you planning on going to college 

191.50 191.94 A: yeah 

192.05 194.95 A: i'm not sure where i want to go though i'm not even really sure what i want to do 

196.61 200.00 B: i thought i wanted to go into education 

201.13 206.88 B: but then i decided it was fun for a little while but i didn't think i wanted to teach every day of my life 

209.94 210.55 A: (( )) 

210.77 212.41 A: it just really depends on (( )) 

212.58 214.47 A: where it has a hockey team that i want to go 

214.81 215.73 A: i play ice hockey 

215.88 217.13 B: oh 

217.73 219.08 B: are you hoping for a scholarship 

219.72 221.58 A: i don't think i would get a scholarship because 

221.95 224.78 A: team i play for now is like no one is going to find it now 

225.83 227.34 A: i just go to go to try outs and 

228.45 229.25 A: hope for the best 

233.09 235.67 B: you never know i guess it is just a matter of 

236.21 237.73 B: the right person seeing you 

250.13 252.27 B: more affordable if you stay local 

253.78 254.85 A: go as far away as poss- 

255.03 257.31 B: understandable 

259.10 259.86 B: in times that 

260.51 263.76 B: nice to leave an area and go to another area 

265.62 268.73 B: but then sometimes it is nice to go back home 

270.45 270.85 A: yeah 

271.96 272.70 A: fed up 

272.83 273.37 A: right now 

275.06 275.89 A: family 

276.09 277.12 A: won't leave me alone 

277.33 284.78 B: that is the age i know that is how i felt that is why i left the state and took off for college i wanted my own space 

299.64 301.08 A: why did you like college so much 

302.51 312.73 B: i think the independence the fact that i i grew up in a really big family i was the youngest of eight kids so i really felt like i had to leave the area to find my own identity 

312.93 313.25 A: yeah 

313.76 318.62 B: so i went someplace new and suddenly i was nobody's little sister i was just myself 

319.96 321.54 B: and that was kind of neat 

324.90 326.33 B: but it was hard work i 

326.88 332.97 B: worked my way you know i had a job all through college plus student loans that i'm still paying back 

334.42 336.13 A: yeah i'm just looking for a job now 

337.44 339.02 B: it is a hard time to find a job 

343.90 345.35 A: brother is in college now so 

345.68 347.32 A: kind of learning a little bit from him 

347.67 348.48 B: there you go 

349.50 351.37 B: did he stay local or did he go away 

358.54 359.86 B: now that is going away 

360.33 362.54 B: can't come home just for a quick weekend 

364.54 365.69 B: do you get to go visit

389.74 390.30 A: it was 

390.81 391.91 B: ah that sucks 

393.12 400.83 B: you got to look for a chance to let mom send you out for a school vacation or something and spend a few days there and see what college life is like 

411.07 411.32 A: i've 

411.41 412.10 A: visited (( ))

415.06 415.91 A: a couple of others 

416.67 419.09 B: the suny system is pretty good and it is 

419.30 421.71 B: more affordable than some of the other schools 

422.04 423.63 A: that is like right up there too so 

424.11 424.37 A: well 

424.38 426.09 B: they are all over new york state

452.36 455.73 B: and i got my associates and transferred to springfield college 

459.44 467.19 B: but i like the suny system and my loans from the suny program were a lot easier to pay off than my loans from the private school 

467.07 467.38 A: yeah 

472.30 479.50 B: let's see i suppose if i could turn back time in more recent history i would turn back to before september eleventh 

479.39 479.85 A: yeah 

480.84 483.22 B: when our country went into shock 

483.93 485.05 A: or just last week 

485.80 489.45 B: or just last week yeah that would be another good one to turn back 

490.27 493.28 B: i suppose only if we could prevent them from happening though 

494.21 495.06 A: (( )) 

495.18 495.48 A: (( )) 

495.63 496.34 A: a year and a half 

496.86 497.86 B: like a scary 

498.17 499.40 B: world right now 

502.59 505.97 B: but just think you are living all these moments in history 

506.89 509.75 B: some day your kids are going to read about -em in their history book 

515.53 517.45 A: still it is hard to imagine everything that has happened
