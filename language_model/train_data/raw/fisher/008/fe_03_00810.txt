58.67 63.23 A: uh i ju- just finished uh i'm own a manufacturing plant 

63.43 64.04 B: mhm 

64.06 70.89 A: and i changed that because it's i i would change it now because manufacturing is really dead in the economy right now 

71.06 72.38 B: right right 

72.02 75.87 A: so it really hurts so i go into a the field that probably 

76.69 79.54 A: i don't know exactly what but something that i knew wouldn't 

79.77 81.66 A: you know change by the economy 

81.91 83.75 A: something that people needed all the time 

84.15 84.52 B: right 

84.74 85.90 B: so is it any 

84.77 85.14 A: you know 

85.30 89.10 A: a service rather than a a commodity let's put it that way 

87.22 87.81 B: okay 

88.68 89.18 B: right 

89.32 90.36 B: that's understandable 

90.35 90.64 A: yeah 

91.14 91.95 B: understandable 

92.05 92.70 A: so that's me 

92.81 93.90 A: i guess that's what i do 

94.21 99.72 B: that's good um i guess for me right now i'm in college and so i think i would just 

97.44 97.76 A: mhm 

99.97 104.93 B: probably take a few more credits each semester so i could graduate sooner 

104.55 105.83 A: that's that uh cool 

106.03 106.55 B: yeah 

106.09 106.96 A: yeah that'd work 

107.51 109.63 B: so it's just it's taking forever 

109.67 110.18 A: is it 

110.37 112.69 B: it's so (( )) i'm ready 

110.77 111.10 A: eh 

111.27 113.29 A: got to do for four years right 

113.40 118.10 B: right but um with my major it's it's going to end up being five years total 

114.48 114.88 A: yeah 

117.55 118.11 A: oh really 

118.29 118.62 A: yeah 

118.86 119.71 B: and so 

119.90 123.10 B: and i have a lot of general requirements that i have to take 

123.01 123.40 A: okay 

123.88 125.49 B: so it's going to take a while 

125.04 126.13 A: it'll take a while huh 

126.22 126.95 B: right 

126.59 128.72 A: oh there you go well that's a good idea too then 

129.45 131.79 A: so there we both came up with something we should change 

131.82 135.18 B: exactly that was perfect 

132.61 133.91 A: there you go 

134.38 135.42 A: very uh you got it 

136.33 137.02 A: all right 

136.38 138.44 B: so is there anything you can think of 

138.79 141.09 B: that you other things that you would change or 

141.57 142.21 A: um 

143.43 146.39 A: not right off the top of my head i can't think of anything else right now 

146.62 147.25 B: right 

147.58 147.95 A: yeah i 

147.93 148.22 B: right 

148.10 149.50 A: that's the only thing i can think of 

149.86 150.26 B: right 

150.20 150.82 A: i mean that's uh 

150.98 151.74 A: that's a pretty 

151.85 153.44 A: that's a pretty big thing right there 

153.72 156.48 B: right that is that is a very big thing 

154.83 155.15 A: yeah 

155.89 156.87 A: yeah that's a pretty 

157.00 157.87 A: pretty decent one 

157.70 164.47 B: so are there any hobbies or anything that sparks your interest right now that you kind of wish that you had focused on earlier 

164.16 170.50 A: oh absolutely if if if it's just that way yeah i would i would just like to have get into professional sports i would have like to 

170.98 172.38 A: be a professional football player 

172.59 173.47 B: really 

173.29 173.96 A: absolutely 

174.11 175.57 B: that's interesting 

175.67 178.81 B: so i'm assuming that you played football during high school and 

178.54 178.89 A: yeah 

179.00 179.66 A: and college 

180.05 180.32 A: yeah 

180.67 183.79 B: aw that's really nea- in college where which college 

181.57 181.89 A: yeah 

184.07 185.65 A: oh it was just the university of buffalo 

185.98 186.67 B: okay 

186.99 188.54 B: that's really neat that's neat 

188.44 188.75 A: yeah 

189.52 190.39 A: so but uh 

189.64 189.99 B: (( )) 

190.83 192.07 A: yeah i'd love to try that 

192.34 192.59 A: (( )) 

193.50 195.39 A: over the hill for that now but i would've 

195.86 197.15 A: liked to back then 

197.58 198.81 B: kind of focus on that 

199.73 201.28 B: that's really neat that's interesting 

200.56 203.15 A: yeah cause right now my focus was on you know 

203.49 206.56 A: starting my own business and you know making a go of it and 

206.57 207.56 B: right 

207.43 208.37 A: so i didn't you know 

208.47 210.51 A: really want to think about sports back then 

210.54 213.81 B: right did you have a family were you married or anything like that 

213.79 214.64 A: back then yeah 

215.09 216.56 A: (( )) 

215.12 215.71 B: okay 

216.67 216.93 A: (( )) 

217.80 222.02 A: i guess that's sort of uh sort of a thing it didn't want me to do it too because you know 

222.28 222.83 B: right 

222.73 227.97 A: i mean you got a family you don't want to get hurt you don't want to get injured on the field and have people worrying about you so 

225.08 225.52 B: yeah 

225.79 226.21 B: you have 

227.62 229.61 B: mhm different responsibilities 

229.29 233.22 A: yeah yeah yeah yeah i guess i used my priorities and put them in a different way 

233.62 234.02 B: well 

234.81 235.28 B: well 

235.99 237.49 B: that's good hey 

236.70 239.16 A: hey what can you do right 

238.38 239.77 B: exactly 

239.35 245.61 A: i'm not i'm not regretting but if you know if i had the opportunity to change those three things i'd probably give it a shot 

245.13 245.82 B: right 

246.58 249.38 B: like right now i'm going into elementary education 

249.44 249.77 A: mhm 

250.51 252.39 B: but i love to write 

252.95 254.94 B: and so i kind of wish that i had had 

255.10 260.35 B: the guts to kind of just go into that area of creative writing and just english 

260.47 260.79 A: yeah 

260.93 264.59 B: but i wasn't daring enough and i love to teach as well so that's good 

263.72 264.14 A: okay 

264.69 269.47 B: but i'm sacrificing some of my other interests for this one 

264.72 265.12 A: yeah 

268.93 269.43 A: are you 

269.59 270.07 A: yeah 

270.51 270.84 B: (( )) 

270.55 273.04 A: oh you could still do the writing couldn't you if you really wanted to 

272.95 273.42 B: yeah 

273.53 274.21 A: yeah you could 

273.55 274.23 B: yeah 

274.40 274.66 B: the 

274.76 275.68 B: see that's true 

275.84 276.10 A: yeah 

275.88 276.50 B: and so 

276.50 277.60 A: you could still try that 

277.94 279.38 B: that's that's definitely an option 

279.55 279.86 A: yeah 

279.77 280.13 B: but 

280.75 281.36 A: well you know 

281.63 284.57 A: it it's open at least it's not closed you know 

283.88 286.20 B: that's true that's true 

285.27 287.23 A: yeah you you have that opening 

287.33 288.08 A: that's pretty good 

288.21 289.72 B: so do you have any th- up 

289.84 292.54 B: other things that would be an opening for you 

292.70 293.49 B: you know what i mean 

294.42 294.92 B: like 

294.59 302.98 A: no just the same old stuff i bet you that everybody wishes and never will happen they want to be a millionaire and never have to work again how does that sound 

301.87 306.13 B: no that's perfect right there 

303.33 312.77 A: there you go i mean you know let us just cut to the chase and not have to do a thing just have it handed to you on a silver platter you know there you go 

311.04 317.03 B: yeah and just go vacationing everywhere and just do things like that 

314.43 317.41 A: there you go travel around the world i'd li- that's 

317.73 320.37 A: that's a dream it'll never be a goal but that's a dream 

320.58 321.05 B: right 

321.17 321.70 B: no 

321.17 323.81 A: i'd love to travel around the world and just see things 

324.16 325.95 B: like where would you want to go what's you 

325.63 327.20 A: all everywhere it's just 

326.73 327.70 B: just everywhere 

327.32 328.74 A: oh uh australia first 

328.87 330.64 A: for some reason australia yeah 

328.90 329.75 B: australia 

330.31 331.78 B: um very interesting 

331.83 332.12 A: yeah 

332.24 333.87 A: i'd love to go to australia first 

332.42 333.26 B: that would be neat 

334.82 338.89 B: yeah i think i'd prefer like ireland or somewhere with the castles and just 

338.87 339.41 A: stuff like that 

339.62 340.25 B: yeah 

339.65 339.94 A: yeah 

340.54 345.72 A: yeah i like the i i guess i like the open country and the you know the like say the woods and uh 

345.63 346.55 B: yes 

345.88 348.78 A: out back and you know oceans and stuff like that

359.09 359.50 A: pretty good 

359.78 360.26 A: that's neat 

360.43 361.22 A: you think you'll do it 

361.38 361.88 A: maybe 

361.53 362.02 B: um 

362.21 363.47 B: maybe we'll 

362.35 363.00 A: you going to try 

363.75 364.28 B: yes 

364.35 365.04 A: yeah okay 

364.46 368.13 B: definitely will try but 

366.15 367.11 A: there you go there you go 

367.86 370.56 A: may not happen but you're going to try right 

369.95 372.30 B: exactly 

370.86 372.71 A: that's fine that's fine 

373.51 373.97 B: i'm just 

373.72 374.07 A: good 

374.34 374.74 B: yeah 

374.94 375.29 A: yeah 

375.69 375.95 B: so 

376.26 377.11 B: that's always good 

376.32 376.74 A: hey (( )) 

377.17 377.56 A: yeah 

378.56 380.15 A: that's it i don't think i can 

378.67 378.96 B: so 

380.37 382.22 A: boy i think that's about it though for me 

383.21 383.75 B: yeah 

383.84 386.01 A: yeah i don't really think there is a lot more to 

386.30 387.51 A: change or want to change 

388.73 389.00 A: you know 

389.20 390.02 B: right 

389.37 392.68 A: i've i've done a few things and i've you know i've been happy with it and just 

393.61 399.92 B: right and and also there is those simple mistakes that maybe during that moment of time you wish you could go back and change 

400.54 400.80 B: but 

401.23 402.69 B: i don't remember any of them 

402.55 408.63 A: yeah that's true that's true i mean sure if you sit back maybe if spend an hour and think about it you might come up with a few 

408.41 410.70 B: exactly but when 

409.17 415.69 A: you know and then even the things i wanted to change if i did them maybe i wouldn't have liked them i might have wanted to change them again 

414.39 415.09 B: right 

415.48 418.59 B: see that's true and then you would've wanted to change it and maybe just 

418.77 420.64 B: do it the way you had done it 

419.79 421.97 A: that's right the way i've already done it yeah 

421.57 423.14 B: exactly so 

422.40 427.43 A: yeah they say some but i i i've heard somewhere or read somewhere that they say 

427.61 431.06 A: your life is predetermined for you and everything that happens for you 

431.60 434.66 A: then it all happens for a purpose so maybe it does i don't know 

434.96 437.75 B: but right i can i can see some parts of that you know 

437.51 437.83 A: yeah 

438.58 441.23 B: just get put in to situations where 

441.49 441.99 B: something 

442.10 443.87 B: just needs to happen that way and so 

444.52 445.24 B: it happens 

445.34 447.68 A: it happens yeah (( )) say there has got to be a 

448.13 450.06 A: a reason for it you know i mean i'm not 

449.67 450.17 B: right 

450.56 453.86 A: i don't know exactly what they are but there is a reason for everything that happens 

454.05 456.10 B: i guess have you watched the movie signs 

456.29 460.93 A: yeah i no i didn't i apologize i i didn't watch it but i bought it i got a d._v._d. player and i 

460.35 461.03 B: really 

461.17 463.14 A: i've got it but i haven't had time to watch it yet 

462.37 463.51 B: you need to see it 

463.56 464.07 A: it's good 

464.24 466.91 B: cause it kind of follows what we were just talking about 

466.34 467.29 A: oh was it really 

467.41 471.65 A: well i liked the i like the you know the previews i've seen on the t._v. so i said i'm going to 

471.05 471.73 B: right 

471.95 473.37 A: i'm going to get it when it comes out 

474.42 477.42 A: i haven't looked at it yet is it good yeah i thought it would be too 

474.46 475.44 B: very interesting 

477.48 479.40 B: so you'll just have to watch it tonight 

479.02 485.36 A: oh uh tonight no tonight i can't do it i'd love too but i'll get it soon though i have to 

485.81 486.26 B: right 

485.87 486.31 A: i mean 

486.40 491.72 A: you know uh i mean i don't i don't like to see anything sit around once i get something but i've just been so busy lately 

491.89 493.06 B: really yeah 

492.71 493.88 A: haven't had the time 

494.51 496.30 A: i'm sure you can understand that right 

496.32 498.41 B: oh i understand that 

497.19 500.99 A: there is not enough time in the day for half the stuff you want to do 

499.22 509.14 B: it's so true and then you just get behind and you just have to get your priorities straight do what you have to do first 

503.41 503.90 A: that's it 

508.44 508.90 A: that's it 

509.35 509.69 A: yeah 

510.06 513.42 A: get that done and then everything else will fall in sooner or later 

512.81 513.59 B: yeah 

516.99 522.24 A: there you go hey i like that one that's good did you read that somewhere or come up with that on your own 

520.18 532.02 B: i came up with that on my own i'm just applying it back to the main topic even though i don't really know what else to say about that 

523.36 525.78 A: very good there you go 

527.73 528.53 A: there you are 

531.51 536.78 A: oh i (( )) i think you said enough or i hope we have both of us i think we hit a pretty good 

535.58 536.35 B: i agree

537.39 539.11 A: yeah we had a pretty darn good 

538.90 540.98 B: i think i think we're set 

540.56 541.75 A: okay it sounds good 

542.19 544.07 A: do you know what we're supposed to do next
