84.03 95.43 A: uh weird strange thing that you can think about that you can even imagine um and they are getting so out of it seems that they are getting a little bit out of control 

95.72 97.81 A: to me um on uh what 

97.20 97.63 B: now that 

98.06 102.23 A: what people will do in order to get on t._v. 

101.88 110.05 B: yeah the last one um the guy left and he mocked the other person that actually did the uh 

110.75 114.02 B: i think it was like maggots in cheese and it was like 

115.08 115.73 B: well 

115.38 115.76 A: huh 

116.06 119.72 B: military people actually eat that (( )) 

118.54 121.22 A: oh that's true 

120.32 124.45 B: -cause we i'm over by a military base so 

122.28 122.55 A: (( )) 

124.91 129.37 B: um i watch i'm a celebrity get me out of here that was hilarious 

138.95 141.94 B: oh i watched that i watched the end i had to watch (( the end )) 

139.24 139.75 A: because 

141.46 148.65 A: yeah yeah it was the same with me i didn't i only watched i think one and then i ended up watching the very end 

148.77 149.35 A: um 

149.67 154.76 A: and i actually ended up liking that one because i felt like for once you know the nice 

155.06 158.71 A: person actually one you know the prize 

158.49 160.78 B: my husband didn't like it at all he 

159.07 159.43 A: so 

160.51 161.62 A: really 

161.05 163.79 B: he thought yeah he thought that uh 

164.09 167.98 B: it was a lie from the beginning and how could a man do that 

168.46 169.26 A: huh 

169.71 171.98 B: which was a different perspective i thought 

172.22 173.03 A: yeah 

173.31 178.03 B: and then i thought well you know these ladies are going on here there's got to be a twist 

178.58 186.38 B: y- i mean nothing is never exactly the way it is said when you're going on these reality shows and then they cut 

185.82 186.48 A: mhm 

186.88 187.53 B: they cut 

187.84 191.17 B: things out and they add things they manipulate it 

191.81 192.94 B: for a good show 

193.19 197.78 A: that's true i think there's probably a whole lot that you never even see 

198.24 201.52 A: because it's not how they want it to be portrayed 

202.03 206.43 B: so you don't really know if it's true so you don't really take it 

202.21 203.26 A: in the program 

207.64 209.79 B: it's just an entertaining thing 

210.00 210.79 A: yeah 

210.25 212.64 B: but you don't really take it seriously 

213.07 213.84 A: mhm 

214.15 215.22 B: you know what i mean 

215.09 220.69 A: yeah i know exactly what you mean i think the scary thing i have a daughter who is fourteen and 

220.03 220.76 B: so do i 

221.13 225.82 A: do you and she is really into watching these shows like (( ))

229.56 230.95 A: yeah and i 

230.01 233.44 B: she watched a couple a couple of -em and i said nope that was it 

233.77 241.79 A: yeah well because (( )) somehow ends up in a hot tub or something and i just feel it's so inappropriate and it's on at like lunchtime 

248.39 249.43 A: it's right there 

249.86 259.62 A: and um they're just it's hard to explain to her that most people that you will meet in your life are not going to act like that 

251.99 252.41 B: right 

259.83 261.11 A: but (( it's )) 

260.57 260.97 B: they act 

261.10 261.53 B: so 

261.72 262.33 B: sleazy

304.35 305.50 B: the uh 

306.76 310.66 B: some of the family members it would be okay with but 

311.33 318.25 B: there's a lot on his side of the family that it would be so cut throat i see i i couldn't be that cut throat 

318.49 319.15 B: i'm i'm just 

318.75 320.04 A: no 

319.43 324.53 B: that kind of person i can't believe what they put their it's just like uh daytime

371.64 376.58 A: i know it was already starting to get nasty and it was only the first show 

376.99 387.79 A: and you can already tell kind of who i think the producers wanted to win on that one because out of all those people they only showed one person who actually ever said thank you or anything to the 

377.36 377.76 B: (( )) 

388.08 389.09 A: the hired help
