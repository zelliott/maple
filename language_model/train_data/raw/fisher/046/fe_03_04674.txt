16.74 19.90 A: i get my information as far the current events from 

20.00 23.38 A: a little bit from the t._v. on the nightly news 

23.47 24.37 B: mhm 

23.80 29.87 A: and also from ah the radio the talk the news talk type radio programs 

29.20 30.73 B: mhm mhm 

30.49 32.76 A: and a little bit from newspapers 

34.21 35.34 B: okay 

35.53 42.33 B: i'm pretty pretty much like you i get ah most of my information from i i use the internet 

42.34 45.44 B: a lot and i'll go on line and look at 

45.55 48.30 B: certain ah news sites 

48.57 53.45 B: i also listen to a lot of talk radio because i'm in my car a lot during the day 

54.43 57.10 B: so i listen to talk radio often 

57.55 60.09 B: ah i read the newspapers 

60.81 64.11 B: usually on line but i'll i will 

64.44 67.18 B: i'm i have a subscription to um 

67.22 71.10 B: the thursday through sunday local papers 

72.83 74.20 B: and um 

74.33 75.93 B: basically that's it 

77.53 83.73 A: yeah i think i if there's something in particular that's of interest um 

84.04 87.26 A: that i want to find other sources like ah 

87.59 89.47 A: like when the war was going on 

89.80 91.85 A: um you know i would try 

91.87 93.22 A: like c._n._n. 

93.41 95.62 A: on line also c._n._n. or 

94.69 96.21 B: mhm mhm 

95.66 97.92 A: m._s._n._b._c. or something 

97.34 98.26 B: mhm 

97.96 99.04 A: um 

99.30 102.03 A: or like right now with ah 

102.13 113.48 A: the the stuff that's going on over in the middle east with israel and the palestinians you know i'll also ah find some information on on the web regarding that 

104.71 105.68 B: mhm 

107.83 108.79 B: mhm 

112.65 114.11 B: right right 

114.19 116.68 B: i basically like um 

116.76 120.46 B: i like using the web for news because it is 

120.57 126.81 B: up to the minute you know it's kinda like watching c._n._n. but you know if you're at work or 

126.82 136.82 B: on the run you can't watch television then that then the net allows you to um to catch what's happening right right when it's happening if you 

129.88 130.73 A: right 

136.50 145.53 A: and you can pick specifically what information rather than waiting for c._n._n. to come around and talk about whatever subject you're looking for 

139.77 140.64 B: will 

145.73 152.14 B: c._n._n. what about local news my lord sometimes you have to go through so much in order to get to what you really 

152.49 156.70 B: were waiting for when they teased it all day 

156.37 158.86 A: [laughter] yeah 

157.13 165.39 B: [laughter] and they even tease it on the radio and then you rush home and try to get the news and it's like a blurb you know 

166.04 176.08 B: and so at least usually it'll say for more information check our web but you know our web site and it's just as easy to go to the web site and get it right there as opposed to 

171.46 173.86 A: right 

176.16 178.62 B: getting just that little taste 

179.40 181.27 A: (( yeah for us the ah )) 

181.82 185.17 A: the news coming on at night is usually pretty late 

185.21 188.55 A: and generally during the six o'clock news 

188.74 189.81 A: um 

190.32 197.17 A: you know we're just getting home or getting dinner eating dinner or something so we don't get to see the news on t._v. as much 

192.82 193.50 B: (( mm )) 

197.09 198.79 B: mhm mhm 

198.88 205.42 B: no i don't either in fact i i'm not home yet from work so i was just getting in the car just leaving so 

205.52 208.77 B: i wouldn't get it anyway so that's why 

209.09 212.36 B: it seems that i get more from talk radio anyway because 

212.93 217.51 B: the current events are always being discussed you know right there 

217.82 219.69 B: as it's happening if you will 

220.69 225.90 A: yeah then if you miss it th- there'll be usually every fifteen or twenty minutes they'll go over 

227.22 228.33 B: mhm 

227.73 230.15 A: all the all the most current information 

229.79 230.88 B: mhm 

230.35 233.66 A: probably repeat it or or come in with any breaking news 

233.52 235.25 B: mhm mhm 

236.30 244.34 A: and then too they they give you sports updates and and the weather an all that every ten minutes or so too so 

244.44 248.32 B: true true especially now with the weather so tentative 

248.65 254.34 B: it seems like every other minute something's happening weather wise here lately so 

254.75 263.37 B: and i have family that i'm the only one that lives in this state and my family all live somewhere else and so it's real important for me to 

263.59 269.17 B: to keep up with them they're in the mid west right in the middle of tornado alley so 

270.51 275.67 B: it i get more information from listening to talk radio 

275.77 281.03 B: than on television because when that big tornado hit in missouri 

281.54 287.93 B: it i heard on the t._v. that several hundred people were were dead or couldn't be located and 

288.08 291.17 B: when i listened to the radio it made more sense 

292.13 295.84 B: so by the time i was able to get in touch with my family 

295.89 298.60 B: because the the lines were down for a while 

298.65 308.95 B: you know i found that only about you know there were only a few people really missing and it didn't even hit on their end of the city so 

309.53 310.82 A: i guess that's another 

309.80 312.78 B: and i get more reliable information from the radio 

312.78 316.37 A: yeah that that i guess that's another way i get some news is 

316.47 318.97 A: from my coworkers 'cause ah 

319.46 322.17 A: they'll normally come over and talk to me about 

322.55 325.22 A: you know did you hear about this or did you hear about that or 

325.55 328.76 A: because there is ah this lady i work with 

328.93 332.75 A: her parents also live in missouri and they just moved there a couple of years ago 

332.61 333.72 B: mhm 

333.32 336.19 A: so when when all that was happening they ah 

336.33 345.12 A: she was telling us what her parents were you know were telling her about the tornados and how close it wa- you know they were to them 

344.53 346.28 B: mhm mhm 

345.76 349.51 A: and they generally talk about other you know other stuff that goes on too so 

349.52 350.34 B: (( true )) 

351.67 357.10 B: that does give a little bit ah different perspective than what you really hear or see on the news 

357.13 360.10 B: when someone's right there in it 

361.35 362.26 B: so 

363.34 364.37 B: well 

365.52 366.87 B: anything else 

366.95 369.96 A: ah no pretty much that's those are the only 

371.30 375.53 A: those are the that we normally get our our current events from 

376.33 377.36 A: um 

379.20 380.70 B: mm mm mm 

381.10 383.67 B: and our ten minutes must not be up yet i 

383.34 384.86 A: [laughter] 

384.38 387.16 B: didn't realize that ten minutes was so long huh 

388.34 389.97 B: [laughter] 

391.11 396.19 A: so so do we just see what happens we ju- we just have to wait until they tell us 

396.66 399.48 B: i guess mario i don't know 

399.76 400.80 B: um 

401.15 406.59 A: yeah my wife says that we just have to wait for them to to tell us ten minutes is up 

405.78 406.91 B: oh really 

408.69 409.76 B: (( okay hm )) 

410.83 414.52 B: so what else can we talk about on current events 

415.58 416.72 A: um 

417.37 422.77 B: we decided that we get our news from the internet from other people from newspapers 

422.78 424.72 B: from talk radio 

425.70 427.94 B: and sometimes the evening news 

429.89 436.12 A: i guess for for for me it goes in cycles too depending if something really ah 

438.10 440.53 A: something really important or something really ah 

441.11 441.94 A: ah 

442.36 447.31 A: where the whole you know nation is really looking into it i'll end up watching more 

447.89 450.63 A: you know news especially during the war it was 

451.61 453.13 A: you know with every day 

453.54 459.88 A: the whole day on the radio pretty much that's all they were talking about and trying to find out what was going on 

460.53 466.50 A: i think and both during those times i ended up watching the news more and listening to the radio more 

466.30 468.24 B: mhm mhm 

469.18 470.08 B: well 

469.57 471.45 A: trying to understand what's going on 

472.22 475.00 B: yeah because to me it was a little confusing 

475.15 481.33 B: ah y- you know and so you're right a- and you did get a different perspective in listening to 

481.44 483.12 B: or different 

483.20 485.08 B: listening to the different networks 

485.74 486.82 B: um 

487.03 494.73 B: and also from those people that were embedded with the truth versus those that were on the outside looking in 

494.68 495.97 A: all right that was kind of 

496.95 498.22 A: (( kind of ah i )) 

498.72 503.98 A: guess odd or strange to see them there showing live coverage of what was going on 

504.52 506.77 B: i thought it was pretty scary myself 

506.28 509.33 A: yeah 

508.46 514.64 B: i think as a as a news reporter i'd wanna be up on what was going on but not there 

515.30 516.31 B: you know 

517.55 519.89 A: yeah i think that would be kind of scary 

519.30 520.79 B: mhm i think so 

521.03 522.07 B: (( i think so )) 

523.41 524.44 B: (( so )) 

526.71 532.01 B: you know i get a lot of information too from looking at um or picking up 

532.22 535.16 B: weekly papers 

536.05 537.71 B: to find out 

538.18 540.01 B: not necessarily 

540.57 545.91 B: historic events but what events are happening in a certain locale 

546.61 548.19 B: so for instance 

548.41 549.97 B: [cough] are you in atlanta 

550.42 551.28 A: i'm sorry 

550.68 552.16 B: where are you 

552.27 553.98 A: in san jose california 

553.74 557.54 B: oh you're in san jose oh ooh what a great place to be 

557.52 558.30 A: [laughter] 

557.69 559.60 B: ah i'm in atlanta 

559.73 564.33 B: and we have a weekly newspaper called creative loafing 

564.56 569.28 B: and it it has a lot of information about social events 

569.49 574.11 B: and you know fun kinds of things that that you can do in the city 

574.26 581.12 B: so if i'm trying to find out what's going on and i have people visiting or coming to town or if i just want to get out 

581.17 585.53 B: then i i'll pick up that paper it comes out every wednesday 

586.21 590.16 B: it it it's kind of a fun paper it's a little 

586.60 587.61 A: oh okay 

590.56 595.38 B: little off the chart sometimes but it's a fun paper 

595.71 596.76 A: actually 

596.95 599.56 A: another person that i work with he's from ah
