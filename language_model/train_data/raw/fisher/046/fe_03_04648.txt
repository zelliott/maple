0.15 1.50 A: hello 

0.99 3.20 B: hi i'm patrick mcgorian 

3.13 7.56 A: yeah hi i'm uh robert calling from brooklyn new york city 

7.64 13.17 A: um the topic today i believe is current events and how we get it and so forth 

12.56 14.55 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

13.58 26.22 A: uh i guess i could start when i get home from work i typically turn on the uh the news hour which is on p._b._s. which is a one hour uh television news show 

26.45 34.20 A: and that is really my main source for getting news 'cause i watch it basically monday through friday and i rarely miss a day 

34.58 46.59 B: oh yeah i mean i watch various news shows and i get a lot of my news off the internet just like you know i mean and uh whenever i like i don't get the paper delivered to my house but whenever i'm a- around it i pretty much read it so 

46.59 54.51 A: when you um when you're on the internet do you go to the general news site like the new york times or some specialty sites 

53.94 64.53 B: uh no normally i get it with my internet on yahoo then uh i work my way from there and then if i find something interesting i'll go i'll just research it straight from there i'll just type it straight into like a 

64.57 69.41 B: like the google search and it'll come up with all different various news news searches 

69.28 81.30 A: oh i see in my case i'm sort of a stock market buff so on the internet i go to a couple of my favorite financial news sites like c._b._s. marketwatch primarily 

81.39 88.03 A: and then um i kinda go to some additional stories based upon what i find on c._b._s. marketwatch 

88.01 95.26 B: yeah i i don't play the market but i i try to keep up a little bit and i i normally get my information of that off m._p._r. though 

88.19 89.35 A: but 

95.78 97.32 A: what's that m._t._r. 

96.76 103.27 B: yeah for the market just 'cause it has like a a little bit like uh a different take on it than most of the mainstream media 

102.64 107.28 A: and that's the letters m. t. r. oh 'cause i never heard of that one 

106.64 111.20 B: uh the the m._p._r. the it's a radio station 

110.65 123.14 A: oh whoa whoa yeah yeah m._p._r. radio right yeah okay well sometimes when i'm uh up early in the morning i listen to that one hour m._p._r. news show is that is that what you're referring to 

113.29 115.15 B: (( yeah )) 

123.10 135.62 B: yeah this one i forget the name of it but it's a specific like uh show just about f- the finances yeah and it's a it's really quite good like they just they they have a little bit different take on it and i think they're 

135.68 141.84 B: they're not so like pro like mainstream investor they're more like you know they break it down for like 

141.87 151.92 B: you know this is good for mainstream invest- investors this one this is what's gonna benefit like the professional investor this is what's good for the the person who is just doing it part time from their house and so you know what i mean 

151.53 154.85 A: now is that m._p._r. radio or m._p._r. on the internet 

154.27 156.16 B: no that's on the that's on the radio 

156.04 160.49 A: oh okay 'cause in new york city i don't know that uh i get that 

159.86 164.25 B: oh that that it's a it's a pretty interesting show i i wish i could remember the name of it though 

163.93 165.66 A: do you know what time it's on 

166.08 171.08 B: (( uh i don't know it's normally when i'm driving so i know i just normally yeah )) 

169.40 172.79 A: oh it's on b- between n- nine and five perhaps 

172.05 174.08 B: yeah yeah 

173.03 182.35 A: oh all right i'm not aware of that because what i listen to is early in the morning like seven or eight a._m. and then there's a night time m._p._r. show which is like 

182.25 189.98 A: five o'clock or something like that as i recall [noise] but what i used to what what you're talking about is new to me and it sounds kinda interesting 

185.00 186.18 B: yeah 

189.44 200.61 B: it it it's definitely good it's it's definitely a different perspective than like the mainstream one you're just gonna get you know from the i don't know the new york times or or wall street journal or something like this 

199.71 204.23 A: do they come with specific company recommendations or it's more general than that 

203.65 204.75 B: uh 

204.89 213.50 B: company recommendations and just uh investment recommendations in general and just like yeah they talk about like how they see the trends like in the future like go you know what i mean 

213.34 214.43 A: right 

213.81 224.04 B: they're very like open about like uh you know how they feel like different things like for instance you say war 'cause that was like lately it's gonna effect the stock market and like and stuff like this 

223.58 227.28 A: so uh so do you ever invest at all in any stocks 

227.24 228.60 B: uh 

228.84 236.30 B: no i probably should because like normally the ones i pick do pretty well but i just don't really i i don't know i i just never done it i just 

235.68 239.98 A: oh i'm sort of amazed that you'd even bother to regularly listen to a 

240.11 248.02 A: to a financial show if i wasn't investing in the stock market on a regular basis i don't i don't know that i would necessarily bother with financial news 

247.30 257.11 B: but but it's it's interesting anyway it's like it it i mean american society is based on like it's so much based on like just finances and stuff like this you know what i mean 

256.50 257.95 A: yeah that's true 

257.89 269.20 B: i mean you can see like how the how like i mean i i i i go i feel like a lot of our just normal like social news is like almost like foreshadowed by the financial world you know what i mean 

269.28 274.42 A: yeah i agree because i've been following financial news with the stock market over the years 

274.25 286.14 A: and even though i haven't necessarily done that spectacularly financially i've learned a tremendous amount which is interesting and worth knowing which i wouldn't have known about if like i hadn't been interested in the stock market 

285.46 287.12 B: oh definitely yeah 

286.53 289.42 A: so that's a tremendous secondary benefit 

289.18 296.58 B: and my dad's a big stock market buff and i'm sure some day he'll leave me some stocks here and there and i'll have to keep track of them and 

294.73 297.30 A: do you even know what he has 

297.63 308.02 B: uh no i just i think he actually sold a lot of them because he just moved to ireland i think he he like he had a lot of blue chips that his dad left him but i think he he sold most of that stuff 

307.76 321.32 A: oh that's interesting because in my case my father uh has never had any interest in the market at all and as a matter of fact he tends to be rather suspicious of the stock market he assumes he assumes it's all loaded with a bunch of crooks 

321.08 328.82 B: well i mean it is loaded with some crooks but i mean i mean some crooks not all of them you can sell like i mean 

325.99 327.38 A: yeah 

329.36 337.48 B: it's like it i i see it as like legal legal gambling but it's also something which you can be very well informed with you know what i mean 

337.58 343.94 B: it's like it's like kinda of legal gambling if you if you like are researching like sports teams or something like this 

344.31 355.98 A: there's a strong element of gambling in it no question about it and that's probably one of the reasons that it appeals to many people including myself 'cause when you win big you really get kinda excited 

355.39 357.68 B: of course yeah 

356.93 359.87 A: but the problem is you lose big occasionally too 

361.20 370.20 A: so in the end as far as i know most long term investors don't do all that well you'd be better off i suspect buying a house and sticking with with real estate 

365.75 366.57 B: (( yeah )) 

369.59 378.67 B: oh probably but the last stock i picked went up like uh went up three hundred percent in six months and i just killed myself for not buying any 

378.93 381.83 A: oh in other words you followed it but you never bought it 

381.27 384.91 B: oh yeah i i was i was really i was researching while but then like 

382.00 383.09 A: yeah 

384.96 394.75 B: when this and it's just like at this one point where the stock market was just taking a hit i was just like oh well everyone everything's going down i'm not gonna bother buying it now but then i just didn't even think about it like when the like 

394.64 402.15 B: i mean i should have known that like of course when wars happen like stock markets shoot up at least for a short term and i just didn't think about it that this stock would like go through the roof 

402.18 416.83 A: well that's why most people are tricked i think 'cause when the stock market is doing really terribly like it was until about three months ago people figured that's not a time to buy because it really looks pretty hopeless but three months ago looks like me like it would have been a great time to buy 

416.44 417.84 B: oh yeah 

417.14 423.80 A: 'c- cause a lot of stocks especially the cheap stocks have believe it or not really gone up tremendous in the last three months 

423.60 425.04 B: yeah i wouldn't 

423.81 429.98 A: there are stocks i don't have but i follow which have gone up like two hundred three hundred percent in the last three months 

429.24 440.93 B: yeah but it's i think it's more of gamble because i think it's that's more of like i don't well i think that's more of a short short term thing i think like the i don't know i don't think the market's going to take a tremendous hit but i don't see it like i don't see it doing that well 

440.41 451.97 A: i can't figure out what's gonna happen my impression is that the stocks that the stock market is kind of on the high side and it's not going up anymore the way it has been going up for the last two or three months 

451.91 456.46 A: but i don't but i well i kind of agree with you i don't think it's gonna collapse either 

456.23 458.11 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

457.27 462.61 A: but i'm a little bit more confused about what may happen next than i [mn] usually am 

462.75 468.97 A: i really don't feel any confidence one way or the other so i haven't been investing very much lately 

468.85 474.53 B: yeah yeah i mean i would i would take i would take a precaution but i mean i would also like uh 

474.42 485.14 B: i don't know i don't think i don't think it's bad to invest now you know what i mean i don't think we're headed i don't think there's gonna be any like super like it's not gonna shoot up any super amount but i don't think it's i don't see it like just crumbling either 

484.99 496.77 A: yeah that's my guess also that the market will be kind of steady for the next six months perhaps 'cause the economy supposedly is not going to sink again to a recession but it's not gonna be doing all that well either 

497.69 500.25 B: yeah well we'll see i mean 

500.50 512.62 B: we'll just see how everything works with the whole with the whole oil situation 'cause that's pretty much what our economy is like i don't know what i see it's based on like when when oil is cheap we do well when oil is expensive we do really badly 

512.17 517.39 A: yeah that's an important factor but another important factor is not having another event like nine eleven 

518.74 523.83 A: after nine eleven the market went down uh a thousand points in like three or four days 

523.95 530.73 A: i don't think that's gonna happen again but there's a certain amount of amount of risk now that people never thought about in the past 

532.08 545.65 B: yeah yeah i i guess that that's possible but i just didn't i don't know i didn't really see that nine i mean it had that effect on the market but i didn't see it it didn't have really any real financial effects on like most americans you know what i mean 

546.01 555.19 B: i mean it scared them but it didn't like it i mean it didn't like actually like just 'cause you know with the world trade center gone it didn't cost like most people any money i mean it's definitely tragic 

554.55 559.45 A: oh yeah sure well i i guess you don't live in in in or around new york city 

558.80 561.03 B: i live in the east coast 

560.50 571.56 A: okay 'cause see i live right in new york city so i knew i don't i didn't know anyone who died but i knew people who worked at the world trade center and i knew the world trade center very well because i used to go there occasionally 

571.07 577.83 B: oh yeah i'm not saying it didn't affect a lot of people tremendously i'm just most americans like the majority of them it didn't affect directly you know 

577.77 587.07 A: yeah no it didn't affect me directly either in terms of any lives lost of people i knew or financially but but i do think about it now and then 

586.57 599.90 B: oh yeah i think about it too of course i mean it was it's a a tremendously historical and like a tragic event i mean there's no way you cannot think about it but at the same time like it it was kinda weird that it had that much of that it scared investors that well i guess it's new york and 

588.04 589.07 A: yeah
