103.31 104.60 A: yeah [laughter] it's a fun 

104.47 118.97 A: it's a fun then i've got another one that um is a strategy game like where you build a civilization and stuff and put in things and build armies and [laughter] navies and you know i i play those some but [mn] but the ki- i mean um those are probably the two 

111.35 112.28 B: mhm 

119.19 120.60 A: a- and i guess 

120.02 133.64 B: my neighbor has one that he said he was going to ah to let me ah check out and it's about running a city you you do everything as far as the governmental part and the street department and you run a city 

127.00 128.03 A: mhm 

132.01 132.77 A: right 

133.28 134.07 A: yes 

133.42 142.78 B: and i thought that sounded very interesting he said it it's real addictive you can get into it he said it doesn't sound too interesting when you're just talking about it but he said once you get into it he said it it's really 

142.74 148.79 B: [mn] you know you get involved and ah so it sounded it sounded like something i thought i might check out but 

147.81 153.99 A: yeah it's a little bit like this other one that that's a microsoft an- and i think that one's sim city or something i think my kids have 

154.15 167.51 A: [mn] i think they have it although i haven't done that one myself and stuff and then my daughter has some of it that's ah for built for teenage girls where they where they do different things go to the p- senior prom and [laughter] you know 

157.01 158.08 B: mhm 

162.94 164.10 B: mhm 

167.00 172.66 B: [laughter] have your different levels that you can participate 

167.52 169.96 A: all these different different things 

170.08 178.80 A: [laughter] yeah you do the different things you do [mn] you build your dream home and do all this other stuff but ah yeah i have i think um [lipsmack] 

178.63 191.30 A: yeah at least th- the ones that i [mn] like i said the ones i've played and stuff that [mn] just off the c._d. they are interesting and entertaining an- and you do learn some [mn] things you know if you got the right one like i know that um 

185.42 186.23 B: uh-huh 

191.13 198.27 A: my daughter used to do a lot with a game called the amazon trail where you l- you did a lot where you [laughter] 

197.00 204.24 B: i've heard of those but not having kids and all i didn't really you know investigate it but i've heard that they're a good teaching tool ah 

203.34 218.07 A: mhm [mn] that one was real educational 'cause i play used to play it with her and stuff 'cause it make you identify different animals and birds and you basically go into a place and yo- and you collect stuff and you [mn] do missions where they tell you to collect certain things 

206.27 207.34 B: yeah 

211.61 212.62 B: mhm 

216.78 220.13 B: i think they have different grade levels too on that don't they 

219.67 228.25 A: i think so but it it was a it was a i used to with her to do it because we identify the [noise] different birds and animals and stuff and i [noise] always thought that was a real good 

221.84 222.96 B: yeah 

225.94 226.91 B: uh-huh 

228.24 241.07 A: you know a a learning tool [noise] so and it goes it goes real clearly with [mn] like there's one called the oregon trail i think that [noise] is the same similar things if you go across america [noise] and do different things but those are the educational type [mn] 

229.86 231.68 B: that's sound good yeah 

237.79 238.71 B: right 

241.11 249.85 A: ones and stuff an- and i i guess there's a varie- ah you know a variety of different types of of games and stuff i always thought those were some of the better ones [laughter] 

249.10 255.75 B: [laughter] well i know they've got all kinds that that you can get hooked on and all and i 

249.91 250.74 A: yeah 

255.78 261.32 B: [mn] of course personally i i think they've got too much of the violent games that the kids can get into but ah 

260.71 261.98 A: right 

261.55 265.44 B: ah ah that i don't ah that i don't go for at all so 

264.94 267.71 A: no i don't go for those either although kids 

266.62 272.32 B: i i think i think a lot of those on the with all the violence and everything should be taken off but 

269.29 269.85 A: (( [cough] )) 

271.79 274.07 A: yeah [lipsmack] i think that they do a lot 

273.41 274.23 B: (( ah )) 

274.12 282.40 A: ah those go for both the computer games and um like the ones with um oh for the the ones you play on the playstation games 

281.32 290.02 B: yeah on the playboys the game boys and all that ah i just i'm not [mn] i think that they ought to be able to see that it's really presenting a problem 

282.96 284.56 A: yeah yeah 

290.06 290.77 A: (( yep )) 

290.08 291.32 B: and um 

291.20 297.02 A: [mn] i think yeah i think that's one part of it maybe the p- the things are giving some of the problems that we have with violence 

291.40 292.21 B: (( ah )) 

296.90 297.94 B: mhm 

297.24 304.50 A: in the schools and stuff they get so used to playing those games and tearing each other's [mn] cutting heads off and shooting [laughter] [cough] right 

300.41 302.23 B: oh yeah 

303.52 311.74 B: well they they see that they can get away with it and and do the different strategies on on a computer and and they don't realize that 

311.59 319.30 B: there's a lot of difference between a computer and when you've got an actual human being there in front of you they c- they can't differentiate between the difference i don't 

319.25 327.60 B: i think it's it's still to them they're playing the game and [mn] ah i i just believe that that a lot of those games are very harmful 

322.21 322.99 A: right 

327.43 329.05 A: (( [mn] yeah [lipsmack] i i )) 

328.87 342.75 A: think the biggest thing with with some of the stuff is and you know and i use them i me- i mean i mean on a limited scale stuff but [mn] it's the i think in some cases they get addicted to it and i guess getting on to the internet's the same way almost where you can't get [laughter] the kids to 

342.20 343.17 B: yeah 

342.65 355.08 A: get off because they want to chat and stuff instead of go be with their friends and stuff which i've [noise] yeah that's part of the [mn] i guess part of the that's the t- kind of the downside of [mn] getting too heavy into playing the games on the computer [lipsmack] 

354.73 355.83 B: mhm 

356.12 361.58 B: yeah you can um you can get too involved just like with that a- well it's it it can be an addiction just like 

361.52 376.10 B: smoking and drinking and all that stuff it it really can it can be addictive i think you have to really watch it and limit to ah whether you're a you know a young person or an older person or a middle aged person or ancient person i think you really have to watch it to ah 

362.48 363.65 A: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

365.32 366.22 A: right 

372.57 373.56 A: right 

376.00 381.15 B: to limit you know what you have on it [mn] because it can be addictive to you 

380.96 385.82 A: right and looking at some of the content of what like you said some of the really really violent ones are ah 

385.29 392.54 B: [mn] well i i think if you're not careful you can ah i- it can be such a gradual thing that it can lead you 

386.10 387.28 A: hard to believe 

392.85 406.72 B: kind of make what- what's the word kind of like down the garden path and before you realize it you- you've gotten into an area that maybe you're not really meant to get into [mn] and ah because you have just gotten so caught up in in all of it 

402.09 402.99 A: right 

406.76 412.34 B: and ah then y- you get off and you can't wait to get back on you know [laughter] so 

411.55 413.23 A: right right 

412.35 416.18 B: ah i think you have to really be careful i mean as anybody does ah 

415.87 429.49 A: mhm hey have you played the games that you know like i like i said i i haven't done that but i i know that my [mn] my middle son and my and my daughter have sometimes played where they go in and play monopoly and different things like with a group of people 

416.62 418.00 B: [mn] on it 

428.48 442.79 B: [mn] no i've never done that ah basically time wise i usually i like to if i'm kinda stressed out and all i'll go in and i'll play a [mn] ah a hand or two of free cell and that seems to kinda you know break 

442.84 454.00 B: break the tension and and all and then i go on about my business and do but as far as just sitting down and playing a bunch of games and all i just ah really time wise i don't have it for that 

452.47 453.18 A: yeah 

452.94 466.03 A: well that's the whole thing i think [laughter] if you live a [mn] busy life and got things going you don't have time and i guess that's why i s- and and plus i just i guess i've never gotten into [mn] to to you know playing games against people i mean i i assume that that could be fun 

462.92 463.91 B: mhm 

465.85 470.51 A: to to do at times if you had a if you had a game like a strategy game chess or 

470.04 483.51 B: [mn] i would imagine it would be just like people getting together to play dominoes or forty two or canasta or or something like that like they used to do but ah there again it you know it's it involves a lot of time and ah 

475.38 476.25 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

482.46 483.31 A: right 

483.64 490.18 B: ah but i ha- like i said i have found that it's it's a good i guess it's just a break in the routine to to go in and 

490.01 502.61 B: and play a couple of hands of solitaire of one of the one of the different solitaires or one of the games you know and just and just play it for [mn] just a little bit and then quit and go on an- and it seems to kinda i don't know break the day or ah 

495.52 496.42 A: right 

501.76 502.32 A: (( [cough] )) 

502.66 507.29 B: lessen the tension or [mn] whatever [laughter] 

505.77 512.20 A: yeah it's it's pretty neat just the solitaire and the minesweeper and some of the just the little games that they just put right on you know right on the 

510.78 519.43 B: yeah and they i mean it's just it's just kind of to me it's a little refreshing you know to and then you're [mn] it's almost like taking a nap you're ready to go again 

515.02 516.10 A: mhm 

518.87 520.35 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

519.70 522.51 B: get back into the world [laughter] 

521.08 532.83 A: yeah yep and i think that yeah i think those type of thing i think the [mn] of what we said probably that the the if it's used in moderation if it's something that you just do to kind of have fun on a basis it's probably yeah 

531.09 538.11 B: mhm [lipsmack] oh it's a great tool i really d- it's a good teaching tool and all but it's it does have to be [mn] governed 

538.01 549.20 A: yeah no i think tha- that- that's the whole probably the whole key to the whole thing is that it's when you get into some more violent games and some that [mn] you do wonder maybe how what kinda impact it's having on people 

548.56 549.55 B: (( mhm )) 

549.19 553.15 A: and [mn] that plus of the fact if that the kids have so many 

553.33 556.14 A: games and toys and stuff to do stuff with now that 

556.28 564.62 A: you know that instead of interacting with other people and playing like outside i know when as a kid we used to play outside a lot with each other [laughter] mhm 

563.20 570.98 B: well i think i think one of the problems that it- it's having now is that it's very difficult for the for the younger people [mn] to 

570.82 585.15 B: have a conversation a one on one conversation because ah i mean um they can get in get on into a chat room in a on a computer and and talk but to sit down face to face with each other and have a conversation it's very difficult for them 

584.58 585.85 A: (( mm yeah )) 

585.01 586.07 B: very difficult 

586.47 590.94 B: they don't they don't really know how to carry on a conversation anymore they're lost without a computer 

590.78 592.09 A: yeah well 

591.23 594.23 B: and i see that happening in a lot of of the younger people 

593.74 599.89 A: do you yeah well i know ah well i've got my that you know i have three children an- and the [mn] my young
