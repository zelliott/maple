99.27 100.44 B: mhm 

105.65 118.04 A: actually a lot of my information i get from him he was in the navy um back during the gulf war and so i like to get kind of his perspective as an ex military person 

110.71 111.64 B: oh 

118.08 122.08 A: on on the war and and different things and he can usually 

122.50 125.85 A: help me on answering any questions i have about you know 

125.89 129.29 A: different different topics on the war and that type of thing so 

129.53 131.68 A: i rely a lot on him and 

131.81 137.89 A: and um i don't i don't consider myself real political though i don't really get involved in 

137.95 147.27 A: in big debates or or anything like that i just like to keep up with what's happening and i kind of keep my opinions more to myself and 

146.74 149.14 B: yeah i'm generally the same way 

148.81 149.82 A: mhm 

149.57 153.83 B: um but when you look on the internet what sites to you usually go to 

153.23 157.17 A: um sometimes i go to m._s._n._b._c. um 

156.60 157.79 B: mhm 

157.22 164.17 A: just because like i said i kind of watch the today show and that kind of links links to that and um 

160.05 161.39 B: yeah 

164.35 168.30 A: then i always use internet explorer and i just look at kind of the front 

168.73 172.48 A: um page there and see what the headlines are and 

172.35 173.58 B: oh okay 

173.00 177.71 A: that kind of thing i don't i don't spend a lot of time reading 

177.91 179.00 B: yeah 

178.04 183.59 A: stick to the news just kind of the headlines and what's what's happening and whatever i i catch on 

183.76 185.79 A: in the morning news and 

185.82 187.16 A: and um 

187.93 196.33 A: whatever else i can you know get from talking to people and and that type of thing and you know sometimes it just gets downright depressing so 

196.15 197.90 B: definitely yeah 

196.61 203.61 A: you know and it's like you've kind of got to take a break especially when the war first started it was you know scary 

202.65 205.97 B: it was pretty appalling yeah i um 

204.19 205.26 A: mhm 

206.03 211.67 B: i was looking when i do look at the internet i do i look at ah the new york times 

211.08 212.66 A: oh okay sure 

212.21 218.70 B: which is ah a really great resource and it's a little bit different than looking at the um like c._n._n. 

218.34 219.50 A: (( mhm )) 

218.92 228.81 B: or even m._s._n._b._c. it's pretty it's a little bit different and definitely there's a lot more local things going on like doing with new york but even the front page it's ah 

225.21 226.37 A: mhm 

226.69 227.95 A: (( oh right )) 

228.84 240.74 B: somewhat opinionated but i think it's still a pretty good source and i've also looked at um from time to time i look at b._b._c. um just especially before the war um 

230.49 231.54 A: mhm 

236.31 237.55 A: oh okay 

240.68 254.08 B: like ah now that england is pretty much aligned with the united states it's um not as unbiased as as it was at least in that respect they're dealing with middle east things but it's ah it's generally a 

244.82 245.91 A: mhm 

251.73 252.71 A: (( mhm )) 

254.20 259.84 B: good way of getting a very reliable opinion that's different from the united states 

259.21 260.35 A: mhm 

260.05 262.57 B: so i like doing that also 

262.29 263.36 A: mhm 

263.45 275.00 A: yeah i know my mother does that also and she tells me you know pretty much the same thing you just said that she you know had never never followed the b._b._c. before and now she finds it very interesting so 

274.83 275.76 B: mhm 

275.31 281.42 A: yeah i guess i haven't i haven't really tried it myself but that that is ah another thing to look at 

280.11 285.45 B: and it's also available in like generally in different languages which is pretty cool 

284.00 285.96 A: (( mhm ah huh )) 

285.91 294.33 B: um but ah i actually was in china from i guess last year february until september 

286.00 286.96 A: (( sure )) 

294.14 295.26 A: oh 

294.43 307.00 B: um so for quite a few months and actually it was only recently it was ah it was last summer that they started allowing ah people to access the new york times and c._n._n. on line 

306.68 307.92 A: oh really 

306.93 310.35 B: but that's that's when i started to look at b._b._c. because 

309.73 310.67 A: uh-huh 

310.19 324.20 B: i was a very unpolitical and really knew an embarrassingly small amount of our current events and politics before i went and just being outside of the united states it made me realize how important it was to stay abreast and 

317.22 318.16 A: uh-huh 

323.11 324.29 A: right 

324.22 334.01 B: yeah b._b._c. was by far the most reliable and comprehensive news source and so then i realized how different it was in the american source sort of and it's ah 

333.84 334.87 A: mhm 

334.30 336.63 B: it it's pretty good 

336.11 339.68 A: mhm that's really interesting so um 

339.72 348.06 A: you were in china um long before the sars epidemic or had it just started then i know there's been some talk that 

344.02 347.22 B: yes yeah 

348.16 352.01 A: they've kind of kept it hidden bef- before 

351.71 353.81 B: definitely it's um 

353.90 365.71 B: yeah chinese news is completely unreliable or not necessarily unreliable but it tells you know only partial story mostly because it's controlled by the government and the government 

357.72 358.76 A: oh 

362.65 363.86 A: mhm 

365.09 365.99 A: (( sure )) 

365.70 375.93 B: wants things to not get out i mean there's the chinese principle of losing face and ah nobody wants to lose face but in the end it's so much worse 

371.14 372.32 A: mhm 

375.76 377.29 A: right right 

376.16 389.25 B: so it's it's so ridiculous and i can't believe they haven't learned yet but yeah so i i returned and that's another thing that i like to stay abreast of is what's going on with sars because i know a lot of people 

380.25 381.42 A: right 

385.47 386.35 A: mhm 

389.02 402.78 B: in east asia and so it it's definitely good to know about but i i left in september and i think like the first cases came about in um probably like february or march so 

393.33 394.13 A: (( uh- huh )) 

394.73 396.14 A: well yeah 

401.68 402.87 A: (( mhm )) 

403.07 413.47 A: well that was lucky then i know my daughter is um my eldest daughter is seven she's in first grade and one of her class mates just returned from china um 

413.63 418.05 A: she was actually adopted from china and they were going to pick up her baby brother 

417.91 419.23 B: oh wow 

418.10 426.51 A: and i was really concerned as you know are they going to be following the precautions and be quarantined and you know 

426.47 433.24 A: you just you just don't know because like you said i mean they they keep things hidden and 

433.39 439.20 A: you know i i just thought that was a really risky time to go over there an- and everything 

433.59 434.64 B: yeah 

438.26 441.04 B: well h- how recently was that 

440.64 442.87 A: just um this past month 

442.89 444.06 A: and they were over 

444.01 449.92 B: just recently i heard like in the past week or so they've stopped like um 

450.20 454.58 B: adoption of chinese babies is suspended now 

454.20 455.53 A: oh wow 

455.10 464.12 B: so they might have just made it or that was hearsay because i do get some like ah current events information from friends that was definitely hearsay 

456.59 457.89 A: i think so 

462.53 463.51 A: mhm 

463.74 467.49 A: oh you have to wonder though if it's true you know because that 

467.55 470.76 A: you know given the the circumstances now it's 

470.85 472.93 A: it's really scary and 

472.87 487.32 B: yeah i read on the c._d._c. website about three weeks ago that they were there was a lot more precautions and that foreigners coming in had to do all these extra things but yeah as of like a week ago i heard that they've suspended ah 

473.89 474.54 A: (( mhm )) 

483.54 484.52 A: uh-huh 

488.24 489.14 A: uh-huh 

489.01 500.11 B: so good for them if they made it beforehand who knows how long people are going to have wait now and those the babies that aren't getting adopted now as infants i mean th- that's pretty horrible 

491.26 492.30 A: right 

494.33 495.40 A: yeah 

499.90 500.86 A: mhm 

500.45 503.35 B: for them because they might very well never be 

503.49 508.45 A: mhm yeah yeah that is a you know is a sad thing and 

508.47 514.61 A: it is nice that she she got baby brother and i guess it's a biological child too so 

514.83 516.90 B: that's really cool 

515.82 517.90 A: (( you know yes so )) 

518.01 518.86 A: um 

519.40 531.50 A: i guess you know with them it all worked out and they did stay home for i believe two weeks and then came back to school and everything was fine so you know it worked out well for that family and 

531.55 536.26 A: so [laughter] luckily they didn't start an epidemic here or anything but mhm 

535.57 547.07 B: yeah yeah people were joking with me because um i also traveled through south east asia before i came home and pretty much i i had most of the places that had sars 

546.81 548.80 A: oh wow mhm [laughter] 

547.74 551.86 B: so like i put it there kind of thing but 

551.06 552.00 A: uh-huh 

552.20 557.02 B: i mean i met tons of people that have similar itineraries to me so it could have been anybody 

557.08 560.53 A: oh now do you travel for your job or is this 

561.02 572.33 B: i went there for a job i went to teach english really um it was more for the experience like nothing permanent so i taught english in in the spring and summer of last year 

562.70 563.74 A: oh 

565.29 566.42 A: oh wow 

568.73 569.80 A: mhm 

572.32 573.54 A: oh wow 

573.37 578.80 B: yeah it was a great time i really enjoyed it and i had always wanted to go to china and 

578.14 579.14 A: uh-huh 

579.54 581.20 A: oh what a great experience 

579.76 587.02 B: also i'm interested in economics and they're such an emerging economy right now that it's ah it's really fascinating 

586.44 587.63 A: mhm 

587.68 590.05 B: so it's quite an incredible place 

589.73 592.74 A: mhm well that's a great 

593.00 596.16 A: um so what type of work do you do then 

596.18 598.23 B: no i'm unemployed [laughter] 

597.48 599.89 A: oh [laughter] okay
