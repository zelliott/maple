177.80 178.98 A: (( oh okay )) 

183.72 189.68 B: ah not immune but ah less sensitive to some of those things i think

196.62 205.57 B: they're critical of people who are concerned about violence and things and it seems to me that one of the whole purposes of art is to inspire people 

205.50 218.82 B: and they would certainly admit that but you have to admit if that's the case that it's possible to inspire people to be bad or good so the- there has to be you know there has to be at least some consideration to that angle 

213.30 215.20 A: [noise] right right 

218.00 220.06 A: right

311.56 321.30 B: lot of the times you'll get into a game where it seems like everyone's ganging up on one one participant and ah it's not as interesting to me if that's going on

319.90 320.96 A: right 

321.03 325.96 A: right well that's really not the objective or it shouldn't be it shouldn't be the objective

408.88 410.08 A: (( [noise] )) 

409.62 417.96 B: yeah yeah a lot of those things really have an advantage on a computer you know with cards you don't have to sit there and do all the dealing which takes forever 

416.21 417.70 A: (( right [mn] )) 

418.08 422.43 B: and if you're not a good shuffler and things like that you don't have to worry about that

422.48 425.08 B: so yeah they're interesting

473.45 474.41 A: okay 

473.70 481.25 B: but ah i my brother again who's you know much more of a computer whiz than me tells me that you can really get some ah 

478.50 479.46 A: [noise] 

481.50 485.66 B: improvement in performance with a better graphics card 

485.00 487.33 A: yeah that's i hear that too so 

486.50 496.33 B: but some of the good ones are you know more than a hundred dollars so it doesn't it doesn't seem worth it to spend it on my old computer maybe in the future who knows 

492.60 493.50 A: [noise] 

496.08 498.35 A: mhm 

497.86 499.93 B: i might decide to 

501.41 506.31 B: yeah but ah i i enjoy ah you know playing them from time to time 

506.73 510.61 A: [mn] [mn] yeah it's a release you know if you work all day or go to school it's 

506.83 507.88 B: sometimes 

509.84 510.78 B: sure 

511.34 517.82 A: everyone needs a change ah and it's great that you know that they make s- a lot of the games available 

517.03 521.04 B: yeah well i was surprised to hear recently also that ah

577.84 582.30 B: one of these months i'll probably end up getting a new one with more power you know they're 

582.41 585.03 B: the the frustrating thing about that is 

585.08 590.73 B: you know [mn] they they start to come out with new games all the time and and you you can hardly 

588.29 589.71 A: (( right [noise] )) 

590.81 595.54 B: play some of them because they just take up too much ah memory and
