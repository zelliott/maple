116.56 129.90 B: a._b._c. i used to like a._b._c. but i i i began to feel that the main ah person on the news desk was editorializing rather than giving the news

178.51 182.19 A: [laughter] it's telling you something there 

181.86 188.85 B: [laughter] but it it's very interesting they said do you get news perhaps from friends 

182.37 183.73 A: [laughter] 

189.09 194.06 B: i never do the only thing that i think i've ever heard 

193.31 194.26 A: mhm 

194.18 202.56 B: about what happened was the terrible events of nine eleven because it was mid morning and i was out in my yard weeding

202.32 203.33 A: right 

202.87 204.88 B: it was a beautiful day

212.78 213.83 A: (( right right )) 

214.55 218.89 A: well you know bad news spreads faster than than positive news 

218.31 222.47 B: oh well yes i i'm quite sure about that 

221.64 223.63 A: yeah it definitely does 

223.14 225.55 B: do you believe what you watch 

225.69 227.64 A: um sometimes 

228.43 233.30 A: sometimes i think you know the news is really sometimes i don't believe what i hear 

232.75 238.18 B: do you ever wonder what happens to headlines news stories 

238.20 247.73 B: that y- you often wonder what happened to those people that were arrested or what happened to that person they never seem to follow up around here 

247.18 250.48 A: oh sometimes they do depending on the um 

250.81 256.09 A: you know how big the case is how big the the issue is and who's involved 

255.61 256.80 B: uh-huh 

256.61 258.28 A: 'cause you know like 

258.61 266.06 A: cases where there are policemen involved or or people in high places are involved they usually get more media 

265.57 279.91 B: yes that goes on and on and on but you have a situation where there's a drive by shooting of two small children i- in some sort of drug related thing or something a- and [sigh] 

267.10 268.84 A: on and on and on 

273.46 274.62 A: mhm 

279.79 281.68 A: you never hear about that after 

281.26 286.80 B: oh it's awful and everyone's standing there weeping and you never hear whether they ever caught anybody 

285.92 288.61 A: right it always falls off the air 

288.34 294.26 B: a- and sometimes i think the news is competing to see who can get the best ratings 

294.50 297.44 A: well you know th- the whole thing is competition 

297.24 302.31 B: yeah you know if you don't get the best ratings you don't get the advertisers 

303.17 307.89 B: and every once in a while i'm glad they show a little good news 

307.17 320.48 A: right because a lot of is is is negative you know give you all the crime i know people who don't who do not listen or look at the news period because they said it's too much crime 

310.91 311.93 B: yeah 

320.43 322.88 A: there are people who don't even read a newspaper 

322.94 324.59 A: for that same reason 

324.43 328.34 B: well the thing is you have to know what's going on especially 

327.05 329.94 A: that is exactly my outlook on it 

329.14 331.45 B: we have election tomorrow 

330.99 332.14 A: oh you do 

331.47 334.66 B: the local voting of primaries 

332.52 334.14 A: a local election 

334.38 335.51 A: okay 

334.68 338.93 B: and ah there is so little about the candidates 

338.41 341.32 A: (( so how are people expected to know who they're voting for )) 

339.80 345.54 B: i really don't don't know how they'll all get all primed up for the autumn 

345.15 346.29 A: right 

345.70 351.86 B: but right now you know and i don't think there's enough news about that and the only person 

351.90 362.74 B: in our news that's even doing advertising now is our city mayor and he's trying to get a head start on the election coming up [laughter] 

360.45 361.52 A: right 

362.43 363.99 A: well that's the idea 

364.07 369.02 B: but the judges and lots of those people behind the scenes that you 

369.06 377.79 B: you really don't run into until you get in trouble or someone else gets in trouble they just sort of get elected by ten percent of the electorate 

373.25 374.65 A: right 

377.66 381.56 A: yeah you always wonder how do they get elected you know yeah 

380.24 385.75 B: they get elected because they volunteer and no one else runs [laughter] 

383.59 386.56 A: well that's true there's no competition 

386.74 388.15 B: yeah 

387.36 391.66 A: you know that's usually the better of the two evils that gets voted in 

391.25 394.09 B: ah where did you originally come from 

393.97 395.60 A: trinidad and tobago 

395.22 397.10 B: trinidad ah
