5.34 6.85 A: i'm fine 

6.36 7.67 B: good [laughter] 

7.12 10.78 A: okay i really don't know how this works but it's something about computer games 

10.33 14.38 B: yeah we just have to talk about whether or not we play computer games [laughter] 

13.45 16.88 A: b- basically i don't i don't play computer games 

16.51 21.85 B: well i don't either my fiance he's obsessed with them but [laughter] i don't play them so 

22.20 28.28 A: okay now that the reason well basically i don't play computer games because i don't know one the games 

28.34 34.04 A: like say for example what's the name of that thing that came out a couple of years it used to cost like four hundred dollars um [noise] 

34.22 44.15 A: damn forget the name of it it's uh man anyway it used to cost four hundred dollars it went down to two hundred dollars and like to buy the games it's like it's too expensive 

40.30 41.26 B: mhm 

43.78 48.47 B: yeah it's like i i know my fiance he spends like fifty bucks on a game 

47.96 49.70 A: and that's per game right 

49.07 54.26 B: yeah and he and he's the only one who plays it so it's kind of kind of a waste of money i think 

53.66 55.73 A: how how many games does he have 

55.11 58.91 B: he has something like he has over a hundred 

58.67 60.42 A: (( a hundred games )) 

59.82 61.67 B: yeah [laughter] 

60.98 63.65 A: how many hours a day d- does he spend on it 

63.03 67.35 B: he honestly doesn't really uh play that much anymore 'cause he's in school 

67.02 68.11 A: right 

67.47 74.12 B: but when i first met him he would he would play them like for like three or four hours a day 

73.97 81.06 A: three or four well that's that's another reason i th- th- that stuff is like too time consuming it 

74.79 75.66 B: yeah 

79.39 82.31 B: yeah and plus it makes you lazy 

82.15 92.68 A: does all you do is want to sit around play games and instead of spending your money on something you should spend it on you're buying games for like forty fifty dollars and it's it' -s i don't i don't see any 

89.59 90.68 B: yeah 

92.70 98.65 A: (( any good outcome of it you know it just makes you lazy and i don't know it makes stupid )) 

93.87 95.09 B: yeah 

98.24 100.15 B: yeah [laughter] 

98.69 103.56 A: [laughter] i don't not stupid but it's like it doesn't do you any good 

102.81 104.69 B: yeah yeah 

103.57 106.65 A: (( unless it's like an educational game but )) 

106.00 110.92 B: yeah the only game i've ever played that i really liked was that one that's called the sims have 

110.56 111.93 A: never heard of it 

111.03 113.69 B: you heard of that it's like you create um 

113.71 120.68 B: these little characters and you put them in a house and you give you buy them furniture and you get them jobs and you 

120.11 121.86 A: [laughter] 

120.71 122.09 B: it's really neat 

122.08 123.44 A: [laughter] 

122.51 134.39 B: [laughter] you just watch them like go to work and then you you know you decorate their home for you for them and then you watch them cook and sometimes they'll catch the kitchen on fire and you have to call the fire department for them and stuff like that 

133.73 140.94 A: but who all right so while so while you're furnishing their house and all that good stuff the like the game plays itself or something 

140.32 153.44 B: yeah they you see it's really neat [laughter] they'll like it'll be like eight o'clock in the morning and their alarm clock will go off and then they'll get dressed and they'll go to work and then you just like work on the house and then they come home from work 

152.79 156.59 A: (( [laughter] i don't you know something like that is kinda cute )) 

153.45 154.88 B: [laughter] 

156.50 157.77 B: yeah 

156.62 161.87 A: so but some of these other games is like i don't know too much blood and all that i don't know it's 

161.99 165.39 A: i guess you got to have a drink or something to play them games 

164.79 166.03 B: yeah 

165.44 169.06 A: i me personally i can't see myself playing those games 

168.55 173.21 B: do you play like regular video games like nintendo and stuff like that or 

170.69 171.47 A: i 

172.45 186.70 A: i used to but it's like i don't have the time for it because if if i'm not at work i'm always doing something so i can't just like sit there or if not suddenly the phone would ring so i just i don't even bother with it anymore 

176.16 177.11 B: yeah 

180.07 181.03 B: yeah 

185.94 187.22 B: yeah 

186.64 192.54 A: (( the only game give me pinball i can play pinball something like that but with the t._v. then )) 

192.91 200.14 A: and another thing like um the joystick it has so many different kind of things uh man was a good word to play uh to say 

200.31 208.25 A: it's like um so many different you gotta do this you gotta push it this way push this one yeah and i can 

206.13 207.32 B: oh yeah 

208.77 211.06 A: uh it's just like frustrating 

210.51 211.48 B: yeah 

211.48 217.41 A: so i just leave it leave it at that and don't watch everybody else spend their money and 

217.42 218.27 A: [mn] 

218.19 221.26 B: [laughter] i i think you have better things to do [laughter] 

220.74 222.59 A: yeah basically yes 

222.60 226.26 A: instead of just sitting and just playing the games 

225.65 226.84 B: yeah 

226.27 229.53 A: 'cause like my girl's brother he doesn't work 

228.94 229.99 B: mhm 

229.64 241.37 A: and how old is he he's about he's about thirty years old and he still kinda like relies on his mother so his mother gives him money and he goes out instead of spending it on something that you know something useful 

241.27 246.00 A: he goes out and pays fifty dollars for a game and he'll just stay there all day playing the game 

245.86 246.98 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

246.15 251.04 A: so like instead of playing the game better go play the streets and go get a job or something you 

250.00 251.49 B: [laughter] 

251.08 252.10 A: know 

251.67 257.21 B: yeah some of those games too you pay for the game and then you pay like a monthly fee 

257.25 271.66 B: and it can be like fifty bucks a month like my friend i had this friend whose boyfriend he um he plays this game online and he'll like go on there for hours and hours a day and he has to pay to play like for a monthly fee 

265.12 266.13 A: mhm 

270.98 284.04 A: so now you've gotta all right so now you're gotta pay for the machine which is probably two hundred two hundred and fifty dollars then you've got to pay another fifty dollars for the game and now you have to pay fifty dollars to get online just to play the game 

274.90 275.84 B: yeah 

277.46 278.58 B: yeah 

283.40 294.76 B: yeah it's ridicul- he has it charge like his credit card every month it's like an automatic charge or whatever and he goes on there and it's one of those ones where you connect to the internet and you can talk to other people 

287.23 288.95 A: (( that jesus i couldn't mhm )) 

294.92 300.18 B: so it's kinda creepy i think if you know i don't know i think that's weird 

295.05 296.48 A: oh 

299.63 309.21 A: okay there's one game that i've seen that i wouldn't mind trying i've seen it on a commercial a couple of times it's like it's uh um the military game 

309.15 310.19 B: (( hm )) 

309.74 320.78 A: it's oh man i forgot the name because i don't really pay too much but this one looks real cool it's like they're playing uh like on missions and then they say something like i wonder who these guys are at the other end 

316.77 317.78 B: mhm 

320.55 331.87 A: and they're all military guys because i was in the military and something like that military games i wouldn't mind playing because that looks kinda cool playing you know playing other people on the internet but this this 

322.84 324.00 B: mhm 

327.79 328.76 B: yeah 

330.59 331.57 B: yeah 

331.95 338.18 A: dungeons dungeons and dragons and all that other crazy crazy name stuff [mn] that's basically not 

338.00 339.01 B: yeah 

338.25 341.60 A: (( me i'd rather i'd rather save my money )) 

341.39 342.61 B: yeah 

342.03 347.94 A: because a lot of if they if they were to realize if they were to leave them games alone for probably like six months 

347.98 353.11 A: and take the fifty dollars that they spend on these games and just put it in the bank they'd have a lot of money 

352.51 354.49 B: yeah yeah that's true 

354.36 355.54 A: (( yeah )) 

355.00 358.88 B: yeah my my dad loves to play he was in the military he was in the air force 

358.54 359.80 A: right 

359.03 363.49 B: he loved to play the military games where it's like he's the roman empire 

363.01 364.45 A: [laughter] 

363.51 366.28 B: he's like taking over other empires and stuff 

365.89 367.14 A: yeah 

366.36 372.23 B: he r- and he loves like the world war two games where he's fighting the nazis and stuff he loves that stuff 

371.87 374.38 A: what does he play he plays that online or 

373.72 380.47 B: y. no it's like a regular computer game he doesn't go online or anything i think it's called and he plays something called like command and conquer 

380.19 382.12 A: command and conquer never heard of it 

381.23 388.72 B: and he plays like the civil war games where he's like you know fighting the north and the south and stuff he loves the military stuff 

386.63 387.76 A: and how how's 

388.11 390.29 A: how's the graphics on that 

389.71 399.23 B: what was that the graphics they're they're pretty good i mean a lot of those computer games they look they look really good you know but i don't know i i think it's 

390.66 391.78 A: mhm 

399.36 407.13 B: it's it just doesn't interest me i can't just sit there for hours at a time and i gotta get out you know i gotta get up and move around 

401.24 403.06 A: (( yeah )) 

404.89 406.72 A: yeah 

406.76 414.10 A: yeah just to sit there for like hours on end just playing with a joystick and and i don't know it's like 

414.11 417.05 A: (( i it doesn't it's not exciting )) 

416.70 417.63 B: no 

417.72 421.88 A: like i said you got you gotta have a couple of beers to to sit down and play that but 

421.54 422.46 B: yeah 

422.01 427.08 A: me i'm still trying to think of that oh [noise] i think it was a playstation 

426.67 427.76 B: mhm 

427.26 429.56 A: 'cause i back in ninety six 

429.55 442.29 A: when they first came out there there was some of them in the whizz and they were like four hundred dollars and then like almost not even a year later they went down to two hundred dollars so everybody that spend four hundred i know they felt stupid because now they have 

433.37 434.46 B: yeah 

442.40 443.36 B: mhm 

442.89 454.88 A: so it's i don't know it's i i think it's like a little fad and phase that's gonna run out 'cause look at the x. the x. box looks pretty cool but they're always coming up with something different and something else 

448.79 449.69 B: yeah 

453.52 456.05 B: yeah there's always something new always 

455.73 461.07 A: and basically everybody that play these games they got like all the machines like all the games 

460.40 461.64 B: yeah 

461.08 464.96 A: like all all right if you've got the x. box they must have had the playstation 

464.24 468.22 B: and the playstation two and all that stuff 

466.25 471.37 A: yeah so when you buy one you gonna they're gonna come up with something better 

471.38 479.97 A: and then you're gonna wind up buying that but what happened to all that other stuff that you bought and nobody wants it after you spend all that money on it 'cause they're getting the new stuff 

474.71 475.86 B: yeah 

479.65 480.82 B: yeah 

480.02 490.20 A: (( so that's like a a waste of money but hey to each his own you know if if it k- you know if it keeps people from doing crazy stuff out there )) 

482.24 483.34 B: yeah 

489.55 494.06 B: yeah that's true yeah i just can't believe the kids who have that stuff because 

491.13 491.98 A: (( then )) 

494.25 500.26 B: i i can't imagine parents who spend like two hundred three hundred dollars to buy their kids like a little system like that 

499.63 508.83 A: i wouldn't do it i have two kids i wouldn't do it i wouldn't i wouldn't let my son or my daughter just sit there and and and play them games it's 

507.72 508.68 B: yeah 

508.75 522.61 A: it's i it's kinda like dulling of the mind because all that's all they wanna do and then you know maybe it gets a little intriguing if you're young but then after you know you want to run home and you wanna play the game and that's all you wanna do 

511.91 513.12 B: mhm 

522.24 523.16 B: yeah 

522.92 528.10 A: (( so instead of doing something more constructive [mn] you're sitting there on the couch )) 

528.31 531.14 A: and the next thing you know five hours went by 

530.63 531.83 B: mhm 

531.16 533.43 A: your con ed bill just went up 

532.68 534.76 B: [laughter] 

534.48 541.31 A: and now that you're saying that you got to pay fifty dollars online that's that's gonna be expensive especially for a young person 

541.00 542.17 B: yeah 

541.63 546.25 A: 'cause they gonna be the one that winds up paying for it if i was to do it it would be me 

545.81 547.07 B: yeah [laughter] 

546.40 547.86 A: so 

547.79 551.39 B: i just remember having like an a- atari when i was a kid 

550.68 552.38 A: oh yeah that was fun 

551.93 555.82 B: yeah but that was different you know it was just 

553.85 557.82 A: yeah that that was you know it wasn't nothing major 

557.49 563.44 B: no it was just like pong and pacman and stuff like that you weren't like killing people [laughter] 

559.81 561.06 A: (( yeah yes )) 

562.96 570.42 A: now pacman i tell you the two pacman i will miss pacman that was the best i'd rather play that than all this new stuff now 

567.51 568.54 B: yeah 

570.00 570.89 B: yeah 

570.91 574.20 A: and i wouldn't mind having one of those machines in the house 

573.58 576.95 B: (( yeah i don't i don't know if they're still around )) 

576.72 583.56 A: no i haven't them this i haven't seen many of those games in the longest then again all this new stuff has taken over 

580.44 581.42 B: yeah 

583.00 584.33 B: yep 

584.23 588.50 A: but they must whoever invents this stuff must be making a lot of money 

587.75 588.81 B: mhm 

588.61 598.17 A: jesus i could have you figure let me see fifty dollars a person i mean per game and the average person probably has at least you said your boyfriend has a hundred of them 

597.55 599.89 B: yeah but that's like over like ten years
