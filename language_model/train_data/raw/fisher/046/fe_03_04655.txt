29.84 30.83 B: um 

31.00 36.31 B: i pretty much get news from all the sources they mentioned i 

36.91 42.88 B: wake up and watch some news in the morning read a little bit of the newspaper and when i get to work 

42.90 48.41 B: ah the first thing i do is usually get on the internet and look at some of the top news stories 

48.91 55.36 B: and then at lunchtime where i work we have c._n._n. headline news 

55.45 57.13 B: playing in our cafeteria 

57.42 59.38 B: so pretty much 

59.59 61.37 B: (( all of the )) 

61.19 62.01 A: [laughter] 

61.58 62.55 B: news 

62.69 66.91 B: anything you can think of plus radio to and from work so you know 

66.03 67.63 A: (( yeah i'm )) 

66.94 69.95 B: newspaper internet radio t._v. all of them all 

69.16 72.30 A: i'm just about i'm just about the same way um 

73.23 79.21 A: i get up in the morning and usually catch a little c._n._n. or whatever the you know local a._b._c. c._b._s. 

79.42 81.57 A: type news stations um 

82.42 85.33 A: you know c._n._n. invariably throughout the day 

85.81 92.43 A: and then when i get home i usually you know have c._n._n. again i don't know if ah sports news is included in current events news 

88.84 90.51 B: right 

92.44 95.42 A: but certainly i'll have my share of s._b._n. during the day 

92.53 94.22 B: right 

96.33 99.60 A: usually catch ah sports center in the morning and then another one at night 

99.49 101.19 B: yeah 

101.95 103.08 B: (( do you also )) 

103.27 106.95 B: (( like to keep up with the news on the internet at work )) 

106.77 113.43 A: yeah yeah c._n._n. c._n._n. dot com and s._b._n. dot com are probably two of the ones i have most um 

111.65 113.39 B: yeah 

113.83 116.43 B: (( that certainly makes it a lot easier now with the internet )) 

116.33 118.38 A: (( yeah and it and with ah )) 

118.44 125.52 A: you know with all the stuff that's happened in the last three or four years like c._n._n. has just you know taken on such a prominent level 

125.22 126.53 B: right 

126.05 131.98 A: so i mean it's hard you know you must feel like you're behind if you haven't looked at c._n._n. once or twice you know 

129.85 131.78 B: (( [laughter] yeah [laughter] )) 

132.01 136.26 B: all right yeah i feel like i'm behind if i don't check the internet while i'm at work 

135.83 136.86 A: yeah 

136.34 138.11 B: see if anything happened 

138.02 140.50 A: well it's so easy and it's such like a you know 

140.68 149.18 A: it's more of a diversion too like it i don't think it's as frowned upon if somebody you know walks by and you're looking at c._n._n. as opposed to 

143.67 144.63 B: [laughter] 

149.34 150.76 B: some other site 

150.43 152.33 A: yeah looking at i don't know 

152.63 154.20 A: some other site [laughter] 

153.62 155.10 B: (( yeah )) 

154.53 155.52 A: um 

155.67 162.41 A: so i i guess i find myself actually going more into it and looking at like the international editions and looking at 

163.64 168.03 A: you know looking at individual people and actually seeking out more 

167.99 181.99 A: you know if i read a story about you know iraq or something and i see something about some other person who i'm not aware of you know i go and do some research and find out who that person is and find out what their story you know like i recently looked up ah 

178.45 179.66 B: right 

183.15 195.44 A: something about what's his name ah bashar assad is the syrian president you know just to get an idea of where he's positioned himself historically on a couple of the points that are prevalent today 

188.54 189.53 B: (( okay )) 

195.84 207.25 B: that's one of the advantages of the internet if you know if you want to get more information it's easy to just research that as opposed to some other news source radio or t._v. 

207.05 208.13 A: yeah 

207.52 208.39 B: (( you know )) 

208.50 215.44 B: all you can do is passively sit and listen to what they're giving you the internet gives you some you 

213.39 214.31 A: right 

215.45 216.18 B: (( know )) 

216.24 220.84 B: gives you it's more active it gives you the opportunity if you like a story you can 

220.92 224.83 B: follow up on it or if you don't like it you can just easily move on to something else 

224.85 227.44 A: yeah and even even just the availability 

227.50 233.91 A: you know is almost ah a learning tool in that it can give you perspective you know when you look on the internet and you see 

234.55 237.12 A: you know hundreds of thousands of people in 

237.67 241.21 A: tehran you know protesting against americans in 

242.06 245.78 A: you look at all the availability of all the different news that we have available 

246.41 250.20 A: and i think it's available about three times in that sense um 

250.29 251.72 A: [laughter] and you ah you 

251.75 264.61 A: know you see that those people don't have that sort of availability you know it's as if they have one t._v. station or one internet site and it's all done by one person who has a particular agenda and wants them to believe one thing 

262.43 263.75 B: right 

264.74 265.63 B: yeah 

264.77 268.61 A: and they all do and it just leaves them you know misinformed 

268.68 278.69 A: you know not to say that you know the what's available in america is you know absolutely without bias because it's not i mean i think it would be ignorant to think so 

278.44 280.64 B: (( it seems to me like a different )) 

279.77 281.07 A: yeah exactly 

280.91 289.07 B: as a you're right as opposed to especially in the middle east it all seems to be controlled by the government or who's in control 

283.84 284.88 A: yeah 

288.33 289.65 A: that's awfully true 

289.99 294.15 A: yeah it's interesting during the war with iraq they showed 

294.16 296.75 A: some perspectives from 

297.78 301.43 A: news stations in russia and france and germany 

301.89 310.27 A: and you know just some of the perspectives and it you know you look at that after watching af- after having watched c._n._n. for ten days straight 

310.31 315.18 A: and you're like what is what is wrong with these people [laughter] how do these pe- you know these people are wrong where do they get their information 

312.10 313.31 B: [laughter] 

315.43 319.84 A: you know but you know all the information to some extent is is right or wrong 

316.00 316.98 B: right 

320.43 321.97 A: you know um 

322.01 326.01 A: jus- it depends on the perspective it depends on the audience it depends on the delivery 

326.08 339.59 A: um it's really hard to say you know this this stuff over here is right and this stuff is wrong because depending on who's listening to it it really lays you know a certain amount of credence to either side and i'm sure there are plenty of iraqi's who 

333.76 335.14 B: that's true 

339.97 344.77 A: you know would turn on their station or look out their window during the war and see the likes of 

345.01 347.95 A: what was his name um mohammad said al sahaf 

348.64 356.49 A: and listening to this guy saying you know there are no americans anywhere near baghdad you know they're they're running the other way [laughter] you know like 

354.89 357.68 B: [laughter] and they and they probably believed 

357.32 361.67 A: yeah they probably did [laughter] i mean the guy you know he's probably more 

358.33 359.56 B: (( him )) 

360.63 366.69 B: meanwhile you know here's the army marching down their street [laughter] 

362.73 366.01 A: yeah exactly [laughter] 

366.01 379.83 A: um that guy's pretty funny actually they have a number of websites that were put out ju- you know just with his quotes if he if he ever decides to turn himself up you know and ge- get involved [laughter] i think he stands to make a lot of cash [laughter] 

369.49 370.80 B: yeah i know 

379.02 383.73 B: yeah he would i mean you bring up a good point though it it does seem to be 

383.81 391.13 B: somewhat dependent upon the country and the society it seems more common in the middle east where they 

391.53 400.48 B: are more willing to accept it seems like they're more willing to accept the news that they're hearing and we look at it and say you know why would you believe this it seems to be completely biased 

398.54 399.46 A: yeah 

400.03 401.16 A: that's very true 

401.92 412.20 B: and that could be because we have a lot more news sources to draw upon we have a lot more reporters and a lot more means of getting our current events 

410.02 411.06 A: right 

412.05 419.30 A: and i i think we also ha- you know in a different in a different aspect but making the same point i think we also have a lot more 

419.52 423.46 A: successful examples of questioning authority 

423.86 425.14 B: that's true 

424.24 427.69 A: i mean in the middle east you question authority and you lose your head 

427.13 428.86 B: right 

427.80 433.62 A: you know here you know and and you start to get a feel for it some at you know some 

433.73 436.89 A: to some extent when you're going through school 

436.96 441.53 A: you know when you're in the third grade and your third grade teacher tells you something 

441.65 446.52 A: you i mean it wouldn't even cross a third grader's mind to say well maybe they're not right 

446.39 447.24 B: right 

446.63 450.18 A: you know they're a teacher like of course they're right just because they're a teacher 

450.59 462.22 A: you know that's the logic that's used but then when you get into you know you get into high school you get into college you get into grad school and there's more of the questioning and you know why is this right and what about this you know how did you learn this and 

461.99 463.41 B: mhm 

463.39 467.49 A: and it leads to having different perspectives just because 

467.26 480.64 A: you know the market is there for it not the you know not the financial market but the intellectual market people want to believe different things you know that's how you have some of these different cults and some of these other things where people just don't have anything to believe and they 

472.14 473.26 B: mhm 

480.41 486.06 A: want to go out and find something you know whether they want to find themselves by what they've found or 

486.33 490.50 A: just be different or just have something that other people don't have 

490.96 492.31 A: you know that's how you you 

492.56 499.22 A: know some of these like television religious evangelists and david parishes of the world you know make their mark 

499.43 512.26 B: hm i just hope though over in iraq now they will be given the opportunity to develop their own media and develop their own sources and their own 

512.38 518.38 B: ways of communicating the news to the people hopefully it won't be all such one sided as it has been 

518.43 522.42 A: yeah yeah it would be it would be really nice if that well 

522.96 525.66 A: well you wonder [laughter] things like 

526.42 529.06 B: (( well we can hope [laughter] )) 

527.36 531.91 A: yeah y- it it just it's interesting to to think of 

532.85 536.59 A: it's interesting to mark middle eastern success 

536.77 539.08 A: and success in other 

539.36 543.23 A: cultures by what's been successful in america 

544.51 552.45 A: you know because if you even if you had a democratic state like you may still not have men viewing women as their equals 

552.16 553.85 B: yeah that's true 

552.78 555.72 A: you may you may still have you know a number of 

556.67 561.75 A: things where it's it's just not you know it's like you want the same result but you're not really playing with the same rules you know 

561.38 566.95 B: right and to play different ah experiences and backgrounds than we have here 

565.29 566.50 A: right 

567.27 568.30 A: that's true 

568.79 573.45 A: that's true i was reading an article recently about how there are a number of 

574.99 576.05 A: um 

576.96 578.02 A: women 

578.18 583.01 A: and girls in particular of islamic faiths who have 

583.19 585.15 A: expatriated from 

585.64 588.64 A: what would be the traditional arabic lands um 

589.20 593.26 A: moved into england moved into germany holland united states 

593.57 599.64 A: and where it's still expected that they will follow the culture that they learned at home
