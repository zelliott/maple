322.80 333.90 B: but it's it's not like a ride per se but it's virtual reality like the seats and the fog and and it's really they they're really doing um a lot with these um games or a lot of things that 

333.75 338.16 B: that require you to j- just it says stay home more [laughter] i guess 

337.70 342.44 A: but it's so ah yeah p- participation in other words you get brought into the game 

342.05 343.02 B: mhm 

342.73 349.72 A: and that's what i like when you in other words when you're going down a roller coaster or you see a screen of a roller coaster you feel that thrill 

349.48 350.85 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

350.43 353.27 A: and and it it'll get more and more

383.77 385.83 B: there's a lot of technology 

385.68 398.93 B: [lipsmack] and and some of them are so intricate and actually so difficult i sat down with a friend of mine's son he's five years old he knows these games i can't remember all the name of them like the back of his hand and he's beating the crap outta me 

396.29 397.31 A: mhm

408.98 409.80 B: yeah 

413.67 414.24 B: (( yeah )) 

414.69 415.52 B: (( yeah [mn] ))

420.80 429.13 A: it don't it didn't bother them but me i've got to okay which handle do i do this with whi- i got to know [laughter] 

424.84 426.86 B: (( yeah [laughter] what is this thing )) 

427.23 430.67 B: yes what's going on before you jump in [laughter] 

429.73 433.89 A: right before i go make a fool out of myself you know [laughter] 

432.77 438.20 B: yeah a- and the only ones that you can just jump in is those fighting ones because that's the plot you know 

437.46 442.44 A: [laughter] just smash buttons until you kill 'em [laughter] 

439.03 439.78 B: (( j- j- )) 

439.69 448.42 B: exa- [laughter] exactly and then now you can even download from the computer the games on to the cell phones 

448.34 458.02 B: i see you know the the the people playing on the on the trains or the or waiting for the bus that the kids are playing video games that they've downloaded from the computer 

457.98 468.10 B: onto the cell phone like bowling i think w- 'cause i asked him i said what are you doing [laughter] he said i'm playing bowling they can do bowling they can do pinball 

459.56 460.55 A: (( oh )) 

463.05 464.46 A: [laughter] 

467.52 468.51 A: uh-huh 

468.08 473.68 B: so i mean it's really really um i think the technology now is really finally i guess 

473.74 476.10 B: really going in like overdrive 

475.92 477.13 A: [mn] it is 

476.45 482.58 B: with the technology with the movies and then the transa- transition and of course it's a money making ah 

482.83 485.15 B: ah thing here as well 

484.54 490.61 A: oh yeah [sigh] there's a movie out called the spy kids two i think it is 

489.95 494.32 B: yeah i saw part one i didn't see two but i know three is coming out 

492.35 493.73 A: okay two is 

493.87 500.03 A: well one i know w- w- and it may be three but anyway it's coming out in three d. i want to see it 

496.31 497.18 B: uh-huh 

499.36 507.57 B: [mn] yes i just remember you just yes it it is you're right it three's supposed to be in three d. and that's i loved three d. movies as a youngster 

507.60 514.01 B: so i i think that that's really cool and then in m- it's probably even cooler now th- with the technology 

507.62 508.96 A: oh yeah 

513.95 522.45 A: that's right i i when they showed previews of it when we went to see daddy daycare and and i said i gotta come see that i know that's gonna be good in three d. 

522.45 530.95 B: 'cause we have this a few of these big theatres they're called sony imax and they're huge they're like a whole almost like a whole entire building 

530.82 543.55 B: and they usually show you know really like the the sound is really great and the screen is really big but sometimes they'll do three d. movies either special ones or sometimes big companies like spy kids maybe they'll they'll go there 

543.33 550.56 B: and you go and they they don't allow you to have any butter on your popcorn 'cause of the glasses you have to return them remember back when they had the paper glasses 

549.96 551.49 A: right 

550.74 562.37 B: now they have like these things with with a with the speaker connected for for the ears so you can get the sound and it's really um amazing so i'm figuring that's probably what they're gonna do 

562.19 569.44 B: with that movie and have it play at the big ah 'cause it's equipped for that and they don't allow butter so you don't get any grease on the glasses [laughter] 

569.19 570.30 A: right 

569.57 575.39 B: but yeah that's yeah that's that's gonna be a cool thing that's gonna definitely be cool 

573.32 579.24 A: i want i want to see it but ah what kind of [mn] computer games do you play on the computer 

579.80 581.26 B: (( [mn] um )) 

580.13 582.03 A: what do you like the best on them 

581.58 590.93 B: well i i usually l- like i said i'm usually if it's it has it usually boils down to the the fighting games the um 

590.89 599.89 B: [lipsmack] the superhero games the the old school games um i even like ah i like these little like the th- they have the the resident evil
