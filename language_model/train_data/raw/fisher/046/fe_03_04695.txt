279.83 281.86 A: type of stuff so i mean 

282.49 296.11 A: um you know it's a lot of fun i think when you first go it's it's nice if you do have some equipment that's kind of convenient like ah like you know maybe a propane stove or something that's that's good for cooking on when you

328.52 342.98 B: where we travel around and stay in different timeshares and [sigh] um but it would be nice to be able to not spend the money or the or points to to be able stay in a comfortable area so what do you go to certain [sigh] sites where you hook up 

343.09 345.61 B: to electricity or [sigh] or no 

345.63 348.93 A: [sigh] [noise] when we go camping we don't use electricity at all
