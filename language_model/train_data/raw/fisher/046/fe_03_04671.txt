41.60 44.16 B: [laughter] yeah 

42.93 49.35 A: see it here i can just go through it quickly and figure out the articles i want rather than flipping through sixty seventy pages 

49.23 56.13 B: is that how big the paper is [laughter] well i i guess i pick out just a couple of sections that i read i don't go through the whole thing 

55.43 61.33 A: uh-huh i think in the new york papers actually the times is a real pain to read [laughter]

84.53 85.38 B: (( [laughter] )) 

85.12 86.88 A: it's not exactly easy 

86.91 89.33 A: so i fold that sucker up [laughter] 

87.09 87.91 B: yeah 

89.74 97.73 A: yeah so what i do then is i just print a couple of pages of whatever articles i want to read over the internet and it's much easier to read that way 

97.66 106.42 B: yeah and the internet's good i mean i usually don't start at the internet but if i want to know a little more about something i can usually find it on the internet 

105.87 107.21 A: mhm 

107.00 108.37 B: and it's good 

108.78 112.87 A: oh it's just kind of the way i've done things the last couple of years i guess 

113.16 116.09 A: especially since we got the internet at work it's just easier 

116.06 117.94 B: mhm 

117.27 118.73 A: so there is some point 

118.60 123.49 B: plus if you have down time at work then [laughter] instead of just sitting around doing nothing 

124.18 127.91 A: mhm it's not necessarily down time at some point you gotta catch a breath 

127.88 128.75 B: yeah 

128.20 131.14 A: at work you know eight straight hours [laughter] 

130.95 132.46 B: yeah yeah really 

131.90 133.10 A: so 

132.69 133.77 B: what do you do 

133.98 138.88 A: ah i work for a bank and a credit card so we get a lot of that so we get some of the 

135.41 136.26 B: uh-huh 

138.92 146.48 A: news on the internet that affects the bank or credit card comes through email stuff also [laughter] a 

145.80 147.76 B: right right 

147.20 154.47 A: lot of it is just read non newspaper and t._v. wise i don't get home in time to watch the ah 

150.11 151.24 B: mhm 

155.39 158.64 A: the news 'cause it's six o'clock here 

158.22 164.39 B: yeah i don't i don't i i have- haven't been getting home in time to see world news lately since 

163.39 164.28 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

164.47 167.17 B: since i started working this summer 

168.39 179.52 A: so i just lined up by the time i get home and eat dinner it's you know the news doesn't come on till eleven o'clock then well i guess there are some ten o'clock news here in new york 

179.54 181.75 B: yeah we get one at ten o'clock here 

181.80 184.98 A: mhm well actually we got three now yeah 

185.42 187.59 A: they've expanded more of these things 

187.72 191.27 A: but by that point in time most of the news is already known [laughter] 

191.05 192.98 B: mhm 

194.17 195.99 B: yeah 

196.58 200.71 A: so i guess ah think more people you were born in texas 

200.62 201.64 B: what's that 

200.93 202.99 A: are you were you born in texas 

202.46 203.44 B: (( yes sir )) 

203.35 204.14 A: oh 

204.16 207.05 A: you can't have much of a texas accent ya'll 

207.05 217.27 B: [laughter] no i i guess not um i i was born in maine in texas and right now i'm basically that's austin so i've been in austin my whole life 

217.14 224.33 A: oh okay 'cause i i spent ah like we've moved a bunch of people to dallas a couple of years ago so i ah 

224.52 233.60 A: made six trips in a year and it seemed like most people we hired in dallas weren't from dallas or often texas even most of them were transplants 

231.90 232.89 B: yeah 

233.32 240.52 B: well my ah sister she wa- she used to live here in texas but now she works for national geographic in new york 

239.97 241.79 A: oh mhm 

240.99 242.29 B: yeah 

243.33 252.65 A: yeah i was just thinking like with a lot of people having moved from their home from their original homes more people go into the internet i would think 

252.30 253.30 B: (( mhm )) 

252.74 257.60 A: and i do i have some friends that have moved out of new york so i'll i'll forward them articles 

258.29 262.08 A: from the times if i see it which i think they'll be interested in 

258.48 259.37 B: yeah 

263.91 266.77 A: makes it you know easy to keep up with ah 

267.26 268.83 A: things you remember 

268.90 272.24 A: like there was a basketball player who passed away dave de busschere 

272.23 273.29 B: mhm 

272.75 284.96 A: which well was a big player when i was growing up some of my friends are down florida now so i just emailed them the article last week figuring it pro- good chance it won't hit the florida newspapers [laughter] or the florida 

280.34 281.16 B: yeah 

284.26 290.37 B: yeah exactly i think the nice thing about that you can do multiple articles or whatever you need and just send them on their way 

290.09 291.42 A: (( mhm )) 

290.66 295.68 B: nice and easy to look at and then you can delete 'em you know you don't have a pile of newspaper 

295.37 303.14 A: yep yep actually i did that with some people i know who're located to dallas there was an article on fort worth some of the museums there 

302.96 304.19 B: mhm 

303.56 309.59 A: so i forwarded them the articles so that they might see something that was interesting that they didn't know about 

309.03 309.85 B: (( mm )) 

309.83 311.41 A: so then it's 

311.44 315.28 A: then i buy the sunday times is what i buy 

315.30 316.04 B: (( yeah ah )) 

315.31 319.21 A: but that thing lasts a couple of days i don't know if you've seen the sunday times 

318.66 320.57 B: i don't know how big is that one 

320.50 324.72 A: ah it's ah like nine ten sections 

324.45 325.26 B: gee 

325.51 327.06 A: it's huge 

327.18 327.76 B: (( yeah )) 

327.39 328.66 A: actually the 

329.04 332.92 A: i as far as i know it's the premier newspaper in the world [laughter] 

332.51 335.11 B: mhm yeah it's got quite a reputation 

334.94 340.54 A: especially the sunday one because they have a lot of other things in there they'll have 

339.10 340.67 B: right 

340.60 344.72 A: a big travel section and then you'll have lots of leisure 

345.75 350.33 A: and besides you know the sports the news a ah magazine they 

350.41 351.99 A: have a weekly review 

350.69 352.30 B: yeah 

352.25 358.68 A: then whenever i travel i actually usually like to look at the local newspapers i find it interesting to see what's going on 

356.09 356.90 B: mhm 

358.56 362.49 B: yeah what the the important things are in different different areas 

362.01 363.51 A: mhm yeah 

362.84 364.45 B: yeah 

363.58 369.51 A: yeah it's kind of interesting to see what they consider news and get a different slant on it 

368.97 374.30 B: i do the same thing yeah yeah every once in a while i get a u._s._a. today or something 

374.40 379.73 B: encompasses the whole country basically pretty pretty good to look at every now and then 

376.95 377.87 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

379.66 384.43 A: mhm yeah you get to hear things about places that you never would dream about 

383.87 386.53 B: (( exactly exactly )) 

384.50 385.45 A: (( so it's )) 

386.23 396.63 A: yeah it's kind of so i guess the newspaper has its place but i don't know i guess more and more i'm getting into the internet with just easier to zone in on what i want 

396.30 398.13 B: uh-huh yeah yeah 

396.92 403.67 A: and then read it at my own convenience but again if i didn't have it at work if i was a teacher or something i'm not sure i would be doing that so fast 

403.59 405.23 B: (( yeah that's true )) 

404.20 405.20 A: (( [laughter] )) 

405.70 407.33 A: yeah 

406.67 412.01 B: when when i have time i like to read the newspaper if not then you have the internet's really useful 

414.89 418.45 A: mm is this your first call with these people with this fisher group or 

418.92 420.40 B: (( ah yeah )) 

419.82 420.78 A: oh okay 

421.23 426.21 A: this is my second one the other one was a much easier topic to talk about [laughter] for ten minutes 

425.78 430.29 B: yeah we kind of finished this topic off didn't we [laughter] pretty quickly 

428.70 434.83 A: oh this is like i was surprised to see it's kinda like it seemed like about a three minute four minute conversation 

434.49 435.69 B: yeah 

435.13 441.43 A: the other one was a little more you know what kind of business would you start and how would you advertise it 

440.91 442.06 B: (( oh really )) 

441.55 449.44 A: yeah so i was i mean you could we kept we were talking you know when they told us to stop 'cause there's so much you can talk about [laughter] 

442.23 443.34 B: (( that's interesting )) 

449.36 450.23 B: uh-huh 

449.82 452.81 A: this one is like how do you get your news [laughter] 

454.27 457.06 B: yeah [laughter] 

456.30 457.24 A: so 

457.34 459.30 B: yeah what are you going to do with that 

459.54 460.67 B: (( i don't know )) 

460.51 462.78 A: oh i get it from the martians [laughter] 

462.51 463.75 B: yeah really 

465.27 468.19 B: yeah watch a little c._n._n. when i can 

467.90 469.43 A: (( do you i )) 

470.21 474.61 A: i actually have protested against getting cable 

474.21 475.46 B: oh yeah 

476.03 476.94 A: so 

476.44 478.05 B: why's that 

477.97 480.27 A: because they charge you a fortune 

479.89 483.09 B: oh yeah that's true yeah i pay for it [laughter] 

482.22 487.66 A: mhm yeah and since i don't have any kids i don't feel the need i need it [laughter] 

487.97 488.94 B: yeah 

488.34 495.52 A: yeah if you got kids it's better than watching or have them do other things you can give them some of the educational the disney stuff 

495.44 500.80 B: yeah well it comes it comes in handy right about now for the play offs when they don't put the games on 

500.54 501.68 A: mhm 

500.86 502.61 B: the standard channels 

502.74 509.05 A: oh fortunately that's true but the problem is they don't put 'em on because people pay a zillion dollars 

509.09 510.07 B: yeah 

509.53 516.00 A: so i can the other thing is in new york you get a lot of stations more so than other parts of the country 

515.43 517.72 B: how many standard stations do you get 

517.31 521.30 A: got one two three four five six standard 

521.23 522.05 B: uh-huh 

522.31 525.87 A: yeah the three big ones a._b._c. n._b._c. c._b._s. 

525.99 534.37 A: they got a fox one a u._p._n. and a w._p._n. and they put a lot of local ones on the other three yeah besides the national ones 

529.41 530.27 B: mhm 

534.37 535.85 B: right right 

535.37 537.51 A: and then plus you got your p._b._s. mhm 

537.51 539.85 B: yeah i like i like to watch that when i can 

541.07 554.82 A: yep and then you actually get a couple of weird ones um or else you get a couple of p._b._s. on the other things so it's enough to keep me going i mean i sit home by myself so it's easy i'm at work all day 

554.58 560.25 B: yeah really i mean you're probably busy enough where it doesn't you're not you know [laughter] needing those other channels 

560.11 565.56 A: no no it's a couple of hours a night and on weekends i did miss some of the sports but 

565.61 566.95 B: yeah 

566.75 571.52 A: and i also complain about when they pay these guys ten million dollars a year [laughter] 

570.79 572.91 B: (( yeah what are you going to do [laughter] )) 

573.15 574.71 A: where's the cable fees 

575.11 576.32 B: yeah really 

576.09 577.32 A: so that's what 

576.43 581.89 B: my my dad he doesn't have cable but he'll come over here and watch the games [laughter] 

581.13 583.68 A: ah see he's worked that well 

583.08 584.31 B: yeah 

583.72 591.24 A: and then that's one of the things i guess i do see when i travel or friends have like c._n._n. i mean that's certainly a premier station 

591.11 592.37 B: mhm 

591.37 595.67 A: the news on that's a little different than watching a._b._c. local news 

595.63 596.53 B: yeah 

596.00 598.53 A: or even the other world news tonight 

598.07 599.01 B: (( yeah ))
