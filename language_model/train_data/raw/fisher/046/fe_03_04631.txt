24.24 26.06 B: i'm not sure i'm familiar with that 

26.18 32.35 A: okay that's where you have to try to get through the patterns that are there 

32.34 46.14 A: without getting blown up too many times and the less times you get blown up the better it is and as [cough] you said as you said i don't know if they count as computer games for what they're asking about i think they're talking about like playstation type games

91.85 94.76 A: don't ask me what the name of the game is [cough] 

95.74 97.31 A: but my nephew 

98.50 107.62 A: he's what twenty eight twenty nine he has all these games all right not necessarily that one but he has this one game that i play with him and it's uh 

107.74 111.82 A: it's sort of a well they're all i guess kung fu type style 

111.32 112.34 B: (( right mhm )) 

111.88 113.90 A: but this has more boxing in it 

115.51 128.43 A: and depending on which way he sets it and i try to get him to set it the way i like to have it set it actually has it's more boxing where it actually gives you scores like if you were boxing don't ask me how they do the scores but i love it 

128.48 129.76 A: [laughter] 

129.18 132.36 B: [laughter] well at least uh hopefully you don't have any french judges 

132.39 143.94 A: [laughter] cute cute [laughter] oh wait a minute the way they treated the the the last go round then they do with a benefit by uh 

135.93 137.32 B: forgive me on that 

137.68 138.75 B: but uh 

145.19 148.87 A: no they didn't do us benefit state they gave us second place instead of first place 

148.38 150.75 B: right well i'm thinking of the olympics 

150.74 154.80 A: (( yeah )) 

150.94 158.39 B: which was a little outrageous but an interesting side note to computer games the uh 

158.45 159.63 B: um 

160.28 162.44 B: hyundai is it hyundai 

162.56 171.96 B: one of one of the the asian car manufacturers the was uh working on a new model it's the imprezza w._r._x. it's 

171.97 177.37 B: it's really geared to that x. generation it's a smaller four seat coupe 

177.51 182.27 B: um but they had it in uh a game um 

181.82 182.86 A: (( [noise] )) 

182.41 185.34 B: something about auto auto 

185.87 188.36 B: crash i i don't know one of these auto 

187.08 190.42 A: i think i think i saw something about that i haven't seen 

189.99 190.87 B: yeah 

190.66 194.50 A: and i think you're right i think it's hyundai not honda 

193.81 195.42 B: yeah yeah it's 

194.51 196.33 A: it's the upper scale 

195.91 206.51 B: right but anyways they had this car in the game two years before they released so they had a built in in audience um a built market for it two years before they even released the car 

202.50 204.19 A: yeah 

206.07 212.92 A: well not not to digress but th- they've b- been doing that type of stuff in movies for years 

212.10 220.26 B: well i'm not sure anything quite that blatant i mean i know they've been putting products in but not you know getting people prepared for a product that's not even available 

219.80 224.15 A: oh yeah look look usually [cough] the james bond movies 

224.84 230.38 A: because then all of the sudden who who's the one who is doing the cars for them is it mercedes 

229.86 232.68 B: um actually i think the last one was a b._m._w. 

232.42 237.18 A: okay i know it was it was one of the german cars barvillian motor work 

235.15 236.15 B: right 

237.40 246.76 A: they were advertising it basically that's what they were doing before they even had it on the market in the movie and then they had the movie characters doing doing the advertisements 

246.93 254.07 B: well yeah and they also came up with a i guess an online like about a five minute uh 

254.19 258.07 B: uh clip of the movie that was actually a commercial for the 

258.17 259.34 A: b._m._w. 

258.72 259.66 B: (( uh car )) 

259.70 263.49 A: uh we better get back to uh computer games or our friends at 

261.99 268.50 B: well i think this is all an off shoot of computer games i i think they just want to see where the road will take us on these conversations 

268.05 271.83 A: oh i don't know this is my first call um 

270.25 271.03 B: (( oh )) 

273.19 275.67 B: i'm just curious you sound like you're from the east coast 

275.14 277.59 A: i'm from new york where are you from 

276.86 281.31 B: well i'm uh i grew up in the boston area but i'm in chicago these days 

279.25 280.19 A: the where 

281.56 282.63 A: gloucester 

282.59 285.57 B: um actually not far from gloucester i lived 

285.82 289.11 B: on the north shore in lynn swanset marblehead if you know that area 

289.18 295.04 A: i know where you're talking about uh not necessarily in my backyard but i know where you're talking about 

290.25 291.34 B: yeah 

293.49 294.32 B: yeah 

294.73 295.91 B: but uh 

296.06 297.93 B: so uh um 

298.07 304.00 B: [mn] i'm just trying to think where where else computer games go i mean you know if you don't play them 

302.12 305.63 A: i i wonder well i wonder if they c- consider 

306.06 309.95 A: well y- y- you've had to play these whether you've realized or not 

310.16 314.07 A: because you sound like you're about my age mid forties late 

313.97 317.04 B: well close you're thinking of pong and net 

316.89 318.04 A: yeah 

317.42 318.42 B: yeah 

318.16 320.92 A: or or how about pacman originally 

320.33 322.25 B: um absolutely 

321.93 325.29 A: yeah that thing cost me a fortune one day 

325.05 331.31 B: yeah well i think it cost us all all a fortune i think cost me most of my sophomore year in college 

327.39 328.11 A: (( oh yeah )) 

330.71 334.93 A: yeah 'cause that's what amazes me i i look at the computer games that are out there now 

335.07 348.38 A: and i i firmly believe that they must have had something else hooked up in pacman i i remember hearing all the stories about the subliminal messages that were in it i believe it must be true because i have never seen another game that has been so addictive 

342.94 343.82 B: mhm 

348.01 351.70 B: yeah well you know something i to think about this i uh 

351.90 359.80 B: i inherited a game from my uh my seventeen year old uh he downloaded it off his palm to my palm 

359.61 360.45 A: (( oh )) 

359.87 361.53 B: which is a um 

362.04 364.91 B: an updated version of uh pacman 

364.88 366.49 A: (( yeah interesting )) 

365.50 369.46 B: i hadn't even thought of that um and for the for the palm 

370.44 376.14 B: it's a nice way to you know kill a few minutes when you're uh waiting in an airport or uh you know 

374.89 376.37 A: mhm 

376.19 377.48 B: waiting anywhere 

376.88 378.64 A: yeah 

379.58 381.84 A: (( well that's true um )) 

382.13 391.08 A: but the pacman probably one of the first i guess what they would classify as computer games and and and when you look at the sophistication of the games they have out there now 

391.09 393.91 A: with the human models and and everything 

392.75 393.52 B: oh 

394.77 397.26 A: i still think pacman was a better game 

396.18 398.75 B: [laughter] yeah 

397.74 402.53 A: didn't have as many moves and anything but it the addiction of trying to 

403.51 404.51 A: beat 

404.70 406.25 A: and all it was was 

406.57 408.13 A: it was basically 

408.20 411.42 A: rows and rows of yellow dots coming at you 

410.90 420.31 B: yeah that was it i mean but it's no no different from uh you know some of these the mario brothers games where you know or donkey kong or those any of those that uh 

416.43 417.58 A: (( yeah i )) 

420.33 420.91 A: (( know )) 

420.62 427.57 B: kids play on the computers these days and you know my my my three have been through all of them and uh 

427.67 430.03 B: they're just fascinated by it 

429.57 435.94 A: mhm and i notice that boys seem to be more fascinated by them than girls 

434.93 442.02 B: for for the most part although there are some games that the um relate to uh 

442.26 445.41 B: both i mean i'm my youngest is uh is uh 

445.52 451.23 B: is my daughter who's nine and uh well anything that the boys do she wants to get involved in 

450.76 455.67 A: but that's because the boys are doing it right but like like my niece 

452.15 454.21 B: (( well exactly mhm mhm )) 

456.27 459.04 A: she is fourteen fifteen 

459.09 464.16 A: when she comes over she gets onto the computer and she gets onto a pool game 

464.99 468.60 B: she's probably paid played against my son he's the he's uh 

468.61 469.91 A: (( yeah the )) 

468.95 471.18 B: lasted a number of hours doing that 

470.78 481.16 A: [noise] and that's the thing is is i know they they play against other people online i haven't figured out how they do because they can play be themselves just you know to sharpen their wits and everything else 

478.59 479.38 B: right 

480.22 488.22 B: well it's it's very easy i mean you just get on on a network like yahoo i mean most of them come through one of those servers and it's just you know you're 

488.52 496.15 B: you're linked up uh internationally at that moment it's almost being in a in a game kind of chat room but you're not chatting you're playing 

495.70 497.53 A: oh i understand that 

497.73 511.48 A: i understand that i just h- h- haven't gotten that s- s- sophisticated if i'm going to play somebody i want them to be there because part of the you know it's like playing it's like playing cards if you're going to play against somebody part of the game is 

504.84 506.20 B: [laughter] 

508.15 509.13 B: right 

511.91 513.88 A: being able to rattle them 

514.30 516.02 A: you know chide them 

516.56 520.60 A: get them off guard yeah 

516.83 522.58 B: [laughter] psych them out right right and it's tough it's tough to collect the bets uh when they're not there at end 

522.21 526.04 A: not unless you're extremely good at what you're doing or extremely lucky 

524.30 525.20 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

526.16 534.11 A: 'cause i don't i don't i don't i remember watching her play a few times i don't remember seeing like any comment section where you can comment back to the other person 

533.56 534.83 B: oh yeah you can 

534.61 537.49 A: oh okay oh i just never saw it 

535.48 536.40 B: oh yeah 

536.98 537.93 B: oh yeah 

538.26 539.86 A: and uh 

539.67 543.00 B: and there is a lot of that that sort of trash talk that goes on 

540.54 541.41 A: (( oh )) 

544.49 551.63 B: which is which is interesting i mean i i i've seen it start at a you know a very friendly you know sort of uh 

552.24 558.15 B: conversation and then by the time the game is over it's it's they're trying to psych each other out 

556.30 557.60 A: they're vicious 

559.14 572.19 A: oh that's nothing new i mean how many times have you gotten into a game with somebody whether it be a card game with friends or whatever and i don't care [mn] yeah like i've i've lost fifty dollars at a nickel and dime poker game 

565.54 566.68 B: exactly 

571.57 572.60 B: mhm 

572.42 578.77 A: it gets vicious [laughter] and it get nasty and yeah you're trying to psych everyone out and keep everyone moving 

578.98 583.17 A: so you think you're ahead of the game but everyone else is doing the same thing so 

583.21 585.23 A: (( i don't know how far you're getting with that one )) 

585.21 589.67 B: [laughter] well yeah but uh it's it's interesting i mean you know poker is a 

589.87 596.38 B: there's there's skill involved i mean you've got to be able to read the card but you know there's you got to also to be able to read people 

595.81 599.89 A: yeah and and granted i guess it's happening
