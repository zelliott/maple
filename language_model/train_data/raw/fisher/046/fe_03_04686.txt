80.62 83.74 A: (( for about you know most days you know [noise] ))

84.15 85.29 A: pardon me 

84.77 89.29 B: ah what what else do you where else do you might you get your news from if not from the paper 

88.66 96.27 A: oh um [noise] that's pretty much the only you know i might like talking to people but i i don't watch t._v. um 

93.06 93.94 B: gotcha 

95.14 95.97 B: yeah 

96.27 104.88 A: [noise] then whenever you know i listen to the radio i'm listening for mu- to music you know sometimes the radio station you know just sort of like hip hop or pop that sort of music 

99.77 100.57 B: okay 

104.27 105.17 B: gotcha 

104.93 114.29 A: but some of the stations you know they might just have a quick news rundown in thirty seconds but you know i don't listen to any i don't listen to the radio specifically for news at all 

113.41 114.10 B: (( oh )) 

114.26 115.15 B: okay 

114.76 115.53 A: (( so )) 

115.88 121.29 B: yeah i i that that would be ah for me an alternative i i do watch t._v. in fact i have a [sigh] 

121.09 134.06 B: um ge- generally if i'm watching t._v. it's the sports i'm into basketball quite a bit i'm watching the playoffs now but [sigh] um i generally don't you know get [sigh] especially the local news i don't watch any of the l- local news stations 

127.08 128.02 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

133.98 140.92 B: [sigh] um i might tune in spec- yeah especially when the war was going on maybe i might tune in a little bit [sigh] um 

140.91 150.53 B: [mn] and then i will get my news um [sigh] i like listening to music also on the radio but i i do listen to [sigh] news and some talk also and get my news there 

150.23 153.10 A: uh-huh like n._p._r. or [noise] 

152.94 166.79 B: yeah definitely ah especially during the war 'cause i i i i kind of got frustrated with a lot of the um [sigh] with the news ah all news stuff like fox ah you're just hearing what they were how they were reporting so yeah to answer your question i 

166.56 179.26 B: [sigh] generally get it from our local n._p._r. station which is w._h._y._y. here in philly [sigh] um i feel they give- [sigh] you know a bit a more objective ah less colored view of the news [sigh] ah 

171.61 172.74 A: (( [lipsmack] uh-huh )) 

178.15 183.10 A: uh-hum [noise] so you when you do watch it on t._v. fox is your channel of choice 

182.72 193.69 B: ah no def- def- definitely not i just like i said it was just it was just kind of i'm kind of using that as a contrast to [sigh] to you know we you know flipping through i can't say i've never watched them [mn] 

188.78 189.79 A: oh okay 

191.75 192.88 A: no [noise] 

193.35 200.03 A: because i know fox is definitely more [sigh] you know news with the entertainment sort of ah outlook on it [noise] 

199.69 201.66 B: oh yeah it it's you know 

200.47 202.92 A: more so than like [noise] cnn 

203.20 203.99 B: yeah 

203.20 212.98 A: [sigh] i guess it's generally what i if i you know when i do turn on the t._v. which is very very rarely that would be the station that i would [noise] i would turn to right away 

208.34 209.00 B: (( yeah )) 

212.69 223.97 B: [sigh] do do you um [sigh] well i hear- which i think is [laughter] kind of commendable that you don't watch [sigh] t._v. i think it's better [sigh] if i i think we i think it's better if none of us watch or we we all watch less um 

219.67 220.45 A: oh 

223.38 236.12 A: right it's just such a waste of time in my opinion and [sigh] like whenever i turn on the t._v. like i'll start channel surfing and then you know before i know it's late [sigh] and i've already you know watched half of some movie on h._b._o. and just 

224.01 224.57 B: (( [sigh] )) 

235.30 236.46 B: yeah 

236.27 240.71 A: you know i just waste so much time so my apartment does have cable 

240.11 241.13 B: yeah 

241.06 248.59 A: i just you know i don't even pay for it i just let my room you know this way i'm not paying for it i'm not going to watch it and it's just much better for me 

248.41 255.13 B: got yeah i i understand do do you um do you get do you seek news over the internet at all or um 

254.55 255.66 A: um 

255.97 261.72 A: [sigh] when i was reading the paper if i didn't pick up a hard copy i just use the new york times the email 

261.70 262.55 B: (( [sigh] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

261.83 265.02 A: you know like news summary to your bo- email box 

264.85 265.73 B: (( yeah )) 

265.09 274.40 A: i kind of do that but other than the times i was you know i didn't ever go to you know c._n._n. dotcom or a._b._c. dotcom any of those web sites 

272.31 273.17 B: okay 

274.41 280.74 B: yeah i i i do symp- ah th- th- that's something i didn't sa- say before but i do subscribe to the ah [mn]

285.28 300.27 B: [sigh] ah and and they sen- except for the recent um [sigh] i guess the ah recent scan- [laughter] ah ah dare i say scandal [sigh] um for the times reporting [mn] i generally i i think they're the most interesting despite the fact i live here in philadelphia i think it's [sigh] 

294.94 296.36 A: yeah 

300.21 312.66 B: um you get you can get most out of it you can get a lot out of it especially um ah ah especially the hard copy th- that's probably why i don't read it so much if you pick it up and there there's just so much there you feel like you [sigh] um 

300.65 301.96 A: interesting 

303.91 304.81 A: uh-huh 

311.80 322.92 A: [noise] have to read it all i know there was a point when i was getting it like most days i just i'd spend you know an hour and a half just i'd have to you know go through every section you know i i'd paid for it so i felt i needed to read it all 

315.28 316.15 B: uh-huh 

322.51 325.60 B: yeah you just feel obligated to [laughter] it's just 

324.82 331.54 A: when you're doing the email thing it's much easier just to scan the headlines and delete and [mn] you know it doesn't cost you a dime so 

329.78 330.43 B: (( oh )) 

331.20 340.51 B: interesting i i you know like i say i haven't taken that much advantage even though i subscribe but maybe i'll [sigh] it's you know now that you say i might you know um [laughter]

365.02 366.18 B: right 

365.58 371.92 A: from each each section the front page of each section and then you know if you want to [sigh] get more indepth then you know

376.49 377.69 B: right okay

384.44 391.03 A: [sigh] i haven't been reading that much at all i've just yeah [noise] during you know when the war first started that's when i was really 

391.08 402.66 A: [sigh] you know i'd get the paper every day to see any new developments but after that i just started to feel like oh you know so much of the same old shit you know just [sigh] new attack new whatever it was i 

402.65 403.75 B: yeah it's 

402.89 407.28 A: didn't have the patience to you know try keeping up to date on the day to day 

406.97 407.84 B: okay 

407.57 418.90 A: happenings [noise] i just wanted to get more of you know just the general sort of [noise] you know the political policy that we might be using and just you know so bagdad was captured but i 

419.10 424.48 A: i'm not going to pay attention if [noise] you know some people are captured or you know a helicopter goes down it's just [noise] 

424.33 426.22 B: it's just the same old same old [mn]

431.38 432.66 B: [sigh] well i 

431.57 442.77 A: just sit down and read these articles and [noise] you know because when i do sit down and read them i take my time i really try to understand [sigh] rather than just glossing over it [mn] uh-hum [noise] [noise] 

439.89 440.86 B: that's probably 

441.78 450.71 B: okay sounds like a good approach actually [sigh] yeah [sigh] i [sigh] i mean th- that's kind of how i fell out i usually i remember [sigh] ah either growing up or
