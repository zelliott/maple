3.96 6.37 A: hi eric my name's lisa i'm fine how are you 

6.37 8.49 B: i'm all right and where are you 

8.54 9.91 A: i'm in texas 

9.81 18.47 B: oh okay i'm in new york a suburb of new york city not in the city uh all right well um 

15.49 16.59 A: okay 

18.95 20.89 B: do you play computer games 

20.73 25.07 A: i like to play free cell and um 

25.08 26.13 A: solitaire 

26.40 28.32 B: yeah 

28.19 33.17 A: and those are just games that are um already loaded on my computer so i don't 

32.03 38.85 B: yeah i'm with you on that i really love free cell and i like solitaire solitaire's more 

35.20 35.99 A: [laughter] 

39.04 46.03 B: you know when i'm i have like five minutes and i just need to something sometimes when i really need a break uh 

44.95 46.13 A: mhm 

46.12 47.94 B: yeah 

47.04 50.73 A: i like we uh i kind of have to set a time or i can 

50.77 53.40 A: play and play and play and play 

53.44 54.30 A: (( [laughter] )) 

54.43 57.28 B: yeah i'm also my sister 

57.31 63.83 B: downloaded this game called um snood which is very interesting it's um 

61.26 62.46 A: mhm 

63.83 73.73 B: it's almost a combination of um it is well combination of i don't know it's like a tetris type of game maybe have you ever played doctor mario 

70.88 71.74 A: mhm 

73.66 75.28 A: no i haven't 

74.58 78.58 B: it's actually kind of similar to that you get these um little guys they're 

78.94 91.83 B: or something and you shoot their heads into the top of the board but you always start with a bunch of them and as soon as there is you get more than two of the same type adjacent to each other then they disappear 

80.77 81.61 A: uh-huh 

82.51 83.24 A: uh-huh 

91.80 98.03 B: and if there's anything like underneath them that's only helped like gravitationally i guess by those 

97.97 99.05 A: mhm 

98.04 110.61 B: then they'll fall away and the object is to clear the board so it's actually i don't know if that was a good enough description but it's actually quite addictive so if you get bored then you know just try that one 

106.25 107.49 A: mhm 

110.48 111.64 A: oh okay 

111.26 112.25 B: (( [laughter] )) 

111.87 120.29 A: do you think it's something that you could i mean do you have to buy it like on a c._d. rom or can you download you can download it off the internet you said your sister did right 

120.07 121.24 B: she did 

121.23 128.17 B: i think that you can download i've actually never really played too many games from a c._d. rom my dad 

127.13 128.27 A: mhm 

128.16 136.90 B: uh bought mahjong i don't know if you've ever played that but he bought mahjong for my mother on c._d. rom and i tried to play it but i don't know how [laughter] 

132.69 134.27 A: mhm 

136.14 138.17 A: [laughter] 

137.37 150.15 B: so most of the one that i play have been um what comes on the computer but i've also played a couple of different things on the internet but they're a little a little bit more frustrating and a little bit more time consuming 

142.17 142.96 A: uh-huh 

145.58 146.40 A: uh-huh 

149.49 150.65 A: mhm 

150.90 152.21 A: yeah 

150.92 151.91 B: but um 

152.84 159.88 B: but um i guess free cell i mean between free cell and solitaire which would your favorite be 

156.09 156.82 A: (( um )) 

159.82 162.18 A: i think i like to do free cell 

161.99 164.25 B: yeah how are you at it 

163.80 168.71 A: well i used to think i was pretty good and then i started 

168.83 172.84 A: when i would load my cards i would start with the first game 

172.97 174.22 B: oh 

173.07 179.32 A: and see how far i could get going from one on up as opposed to arbitrarily letting it 

179.15 180.41 B: yeah 

179.80 191.27 A: giving you a number and then that kind of goes makes you think oh well [laughter] maybe i'm not as good as i thought i was [laughter] 

188.78 193.89 B: yeah i i completely agree i didn't do exactly that but um 

193.76 205.40 B: i started to really keep track of my statistics i don't know if you look at that but um i got to the point where i would basically win seventy five percent of the time 

197.93 198.91 A: (( mhm )) 

204.75 205.89 A: oh wow 

205.28 212.89 B: so i mean that was pretty good i was very happy with that because i remember when i first learnt how to play i thought you've got to be joking there's no way to win this 

212.46 213.36 A: uh-huh 

212.70 218.26 B: and then i got to a point where i got i was very complacent and i felt like i was winning every time 

217.82 218.67 A: uh-huh 

218.06 225.61 B: so then i really started to keep track and um then i started to see how many in a row i kept with the random ones but i still 

225.56 230.45 B: tried to see how many in a row i could win and i think i got to like eight as as 

230.41 240.65 B: the highest number consecutive wins and um and i could never match that i got up to like five or six in a row again but and i got so frustrated 

233.25 234.03 A: uh-huh 

240.25 248.26 A: yeah [laughter] so that's kind of one way of doing it and then it make and i think the confidence level thing is just arbitrarily doing one and then you win 

248.21 256.27 A: and and you're not really so focused on keeping up with wins and losses you just kinda keep going until 

248.39 249.68 B: yeah 

256.53 258.79 A: you know until you either 

259.17 265.06 A: start over with that one or you go onto the next one and it just seems like that kind of keeps the competition 

265.85 269.40 A: level down when you do that but uh 

266.06 267.50 B: yeah 

268.41 269.52 B: definitely 

269.53 277.92 A: yeah well we we uh would play games at work and got in trouble at work [laughter] so they hid all of our games [laughter] 

273.36 276.56 B: (( [laughter] do you have a )) 

277.60 280.71 B: okay yeah so they took them off 

280.77 282.85 A: so they took our games off even though 

283.05 284.22 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

283.52 298.28 A: we were doing it at lunchtime but it just looked bad with us sitting at our desks and uh playing computer games you know like i said even though it was with our lunch we they decided that that didn't look very good we didn't look busy enough and 

298.10 299.54 B: yeah 

298.57 308.79 A: it would look bad for other employees to see us you know playing games and even though it was our lunch and everybody kind of goes to lunch differently it would just not look good so uh 

304.26 305.29 B: (( [laughter] )) 

308.76 311.33 B: yes i understand that 

309.18 310.25 A: (( but we )) 

310.37 319.82 A: used to play 'em at work and [laughter] before we'd start work and before we you know we'd wait wait until it was time to go and then we'd get stuck on a game and 

319.69 320.77 B: (( mhm )) 

319.88 327.89 A: wouldn't leave and you know leave until it was until we won our game and so playing games i think can be a little bit addictive if you 

328.34 331.45 A: if you if you don't watch yourself but uh 

330.61 343.17 B: yes and um towards holiday times when things got more relaxed in the office i used to work at um because we're all on a network as i am sure you are also we would play hearts um but uh 

337.12 337.92 A: uh-huh 

342.79 346.27 A: now see that one's hard for me to play i could never get into hearts 

343.31 344.12 B: (( you know )) 

346.12 351.87 B: yeah yeah on the computer it becomes kind of annoying i i feel because it's uh 

351.94 353.09 B: it's it's 

352.87 359.48 B: i don't know there's not too much going on but when you play with other people whether in real life or on the computer it's a lot more amusing so 

356.07 356.94 A: uh-huh 

358.91 359.76 A: uh-huh 

359.27 370.21 B: being on the network we could get four of us together and play against each other so um it's hard to disguise that as work so we would generally only do that when um 

362.30 364.03 A: oh 

367.84 368.66 A: uh-huh 

370.06 376.92 B: you know like uh the day before christmas or new years or thanksgiving when really nobody was getting much work done anyway 

373.63 375.06 A: [laughter] 

376.58 377.46 A: uh-huh 

377.28 389.16 B: but um i don't now if it's good that i told you about that but maybe if you get some of your workers together and do that but you don't have any games anymore to do that but um 

382.40 383.99 A: [laughter] 

389.15 390.79 A: that sounds like fun 

390.62 392.02 B: yeah definitely is 

392.63 393.46 A: but 

392.80 393.79 B: um 

393.84 397.51 B: and uh have you ever played an internet games 

397.08 399.09 A: i haven't because 

398.92 407.95 A: i spend so much time just you know when i surf the you know just looking for different things and searching for different things that i've never downloaded any games 

407.75 417.82 A: and i haven't downloaded you know any games on my cellphone either i don't you know i'm sure they're there i've never played them so but the screen's so small that i don't know that i 

412.52 413.51 B: uh-huh 

417.87 421.11 A: mean i'd have to get my reading glasses out [laughter] 

420.47 432.34 B: oh wow but there's also games on if you never discovered it it's like actually played on the internet like people from all over really the world could play against each other 

421.41 422.25 A: (( mhm )) 

430.39 431.12 A: uh-huh 

431.84 433.09 A: oh really 

432.14 442.10 B: and yeah and so it's um it's i personally have dials up at home and i always have um i when um you can actually with uh 

437.22 438.02 A: uh-huh 

442.32 451.90 B: d._s._l. or cable it's um a lot easier because it's a better connection and um you know there were like trivia games and everything and um 

444.27 445.13 A: uh-huh 

447.93 449.01 A: oh yeah 

451.72 462.97 B: we would uh there was one in particular that uh my friend loved and introduced me to but i would only play in her room when i was in college and uh it was basically um 

458.33 459.12 A: uh-huh 

463.17 464.06 B: we would 

464.18 465.20 B: (( um )) 

465.41 466.59 B: it would give an 

466.48 476.11 B: anagram like a. p. t. o. but um not give a meaning and there would be different categories and then we would go through the categories there would be like five of them 

469.49 470.19 A: mhm 

475.82 477.20 A: (( mhm )) 

475.87 487.80 B: and then everybody would choose the anagram according to that category like um if they said like politics and a. p. t. o. would be a political travesty 

480.68 481.91 A: oh 

487.80 492.41 B: over there or something whatever it was a bad example but um and then um 

492.20 498.69 B: anonymously everybody would vote on the remainder like all the other contestants but not on themselves 

497.29 498.12 A: uh-huh 

498.47 499.17 A: (( mhm )) 

498.50 510.46 B: and whoever won you know would then go to the next level and i think that there would like real prizes given like money or something and it was it was kind of a lot of fun and certainly very addictive 

510.06 512.05 A: oh yeah 

511.44 518.89 B: yeah it's i've just never really gone too into it because again the connection it doesn't really allow for for it too much 

515.20 516.10 A: uh-huh 

518.30 522.82 A: yeah we don't have we have dial up here we don't have we have d._s._l. at work 

522.72 525.47 B: yeah maybe at work you should give it a try 

524.83 531.21 A: yeah [laughter] i'd be in real trouble then [laughter] 

528.68 534.85 B: [laughter] yeah i wish i could remember the name or um where the like what the website was but i know that on 

534.66 541.27 B: yahoo i'm pretty sure it was a yahoo game because this was a few years ago and like if you go to yahoo dot com or 

537.44 538.15 A: (( uh-huh )) 

541.13 550.97 B: other like major gateway sites like a._o._l. or like you could go to games and find some ones to play against other people or so 

543.59 544.29 A: uh-huh 

551.09 555.71 A: well that sounds like fun especially if it's something where you could you know possibly win money 

555.57 556.77 B: yeah 

555.72 561.16 A: make a little money while you're doing it be our own game show contestant that way 

557.40 558.97 B: (( [laughter] )) 

560.28 562.75 B: yeah [mn] yeah 

561.55 564.27 A: you don't have to go to california to be on a game show 

563.91 570.86 B: [laughter] but um i hope i don't incite you uh you know waste time at work but you know 

569.81 580.71 A: [laughter] well we get watched pretty pretty routinely so i won't be doing it at work but you never know at home it might be something interesting to try 

572.01 573.04 B: so 

580.87 583.43 B: yeah definitely you should give it a try i 

583.26 586.94 A: mhm so do you have game boys or 

587.00 588.71 A: play play any of those 

588.82 590.41 A: those kind of games 

589.15 599.89 B: i used to have uh nintendo years and years ago like the old classic first one but um i stopped playing that a while ago when i was in college i graduated like three years ago 

592.12 593.08 A: mhm 

595.66 596.62 A: uh-huh
