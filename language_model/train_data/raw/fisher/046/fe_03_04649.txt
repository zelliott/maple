507.63 508.19 B: (( [mn] )) 

511.18 517.96 B: yeah yeah i i i had a subscription to newsweek there for a while but uh 

518.03 527.34 B: it it seemed like i never really had the time to sit down and read the whole thing you know and by the time i did get to read it uh the story was old news and 

526.85 527.85 A: right 

527.93 528.77 B: uh 

528.88 531.70 A: yeah sometimes it might be too much news in those magazines 

530.89 535.03 B: yeah they get a little too in depth with the 

533.77 541.23 A: then i figure like every time i i read time and then i read newsweek it just seemed like they were completely opposite like viewpoints 

539.83 541.72 B: yeah 

541.63 542.82 A: so it was more of 

541.96 554.78 B: yeah well the tribune review i noticed uh in the opinion section you know they they're pretty much leaning towards the republican side you know they don't like anybody that talks about bush or anything 

554.18 555.24 A: huh 

554.99 560.91 B: and then uh you get like the new york times or something and they're total opposite 

561.20 564.59 A: uh do you or are you a supporter of ed randall for governor 

564.63 566.24 B: um 

566.29 568.04 B: (( [laughter] ))

577.98 590.34 B: he's about you know what he got philadelphia out and other people were saying oh look he's leaving it in a mess so i don't think we ever really got the whole story on that it's just two different people's opinions i think [noise] 

584.27 585.29 A: right 

590.22 591.39 A: right 

590.82 592.29 B: (( but um ))
