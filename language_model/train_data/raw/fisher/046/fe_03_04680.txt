165.18 166.66 A: oh yeah 

166.75 168.50 A: absolutely 

168.02 170.54 B: but otherwise when i click on my

180.49 190.34 A: well i do not have the internet but i happen to thank god i live in a city which i have to admit has probably some of the best newspapers in the world 

190.05 191.13 B: right 

190.42 199.75 A: i mean i've got the new york times the daily news and if you really want to go go with the sleaze you go with the new york post i don't know if you're familiar with them at all 

199.56 200.73 B: okay 

200.32 202.54 A: but i'm sure you've heard of the new york times 

202.20 203.82 B: yes i have 

203.23 205.72 A: the daily news is kind of um 

206.14 212.31 A: the next step the daily news is i would say about three steps up from the national enquirer 

212.56 214.18 B: okay [laughter] 

212.59 220.50 A: and the new york post is about maybe one step up from the national enquirer [laughter] it's kind of like um 

220.84 233.31 A: but you know i guess i i i wish i could read the paper more but i have to admit i when it comes to news i'm more of a t._v. and radio junkie when i if i need to if i want to know what's going on 

233.39 240.80 A: it's like we've got a gazillion news stations here i mean like ah if yo- like any every 

240.91 252.86 A: inch or not even an inch every eighth of an inch on say the a._m. dial is another news there's bloomberg news ten ten w._i._n._z. news c._b._s. news ab- there's like a gazillion different news stations 

252.71 253.83 B: right 

253.00 254.17 A: (( and then )) 

254.60 260.75 A: i don't know what your cable system is like but literally i i i i must have i'd say at least 

260.84 265.10 A: twenty news stations from o- on on our cable provider 

265.33 269.34 B: i think ours does too but i don't have cable so i don't know 

265.46 266.20 A: (( oh )) 

268.43 275.82 A: okay so it's like if i need to know what's going on it's not it's not a real stretch to try to find out news any time of the day 

275.86 282.93 B: that's good yeah i i like to know about the war but you know i think what they did is um 

282.96 285.57 B: a little over board coverage 

284.96 287.53 A: oh absolutely it's way over the top 

287.09 293.59 B: right so i think that gives terrorists way too much information because they think in street terms 

287.80 288.97 A: i mean it seems 

293.61 299.82 B: you know their their the enemy is you know i mean their ammunition is information 

294.28 295.47 A: yeah 

300.54 310.29 A: well i al- but i mean would you i mean how much do you think that we get as the general public is really the truth i i shouldn't say the truth but 

308.18 309.17 B: well 

310.19 312.97 B: i think it's way delayed [laughter] 

310.49 312.19 A: the whole i mean 

312.18 326.73 A: yeah i mean how mu- i i always and i've had discussions with other friends i mean it's like i i not that i'm like an advocate of conspiracy theories or anything like that but i always wonder for everything that we do know how much we don't know 

326.67 329.87 B: right and we do have to say that you know 

329.97 336.96 B: um we have to trust my husband was in the marines and you know that's what he said by the time we know 

337.27 348.88 B: you know and what we know i- is so diluted you know that it's just not the front line news like they make it out to be [laughter] 

343.00 344.00 A: yeah 

348.08 360.87 A: right see i was i i always i have wondered that myself like you know it's like you know any time of the day you can turn on whatever and see pictures coming from iraq or any place in the world and you wonder 

360.94 368.21 A: you know what are are you seeing like you know the t._v. version or are you seeing what's really happening you know what i mean 

367.28 374.57 B: right right well i mean like now they're saying saddam is alive and well in iraq blah blah blah 

374.58 379.69 B: you know and they their intelligence level is so high 

379.70 380.80 B: that 

380.97 386.38 B: you know they of course aren't going to tell us anything until it's going to work for them i think 

386.08 392.40 A: well i'm sure what they i mean where where did the information come from that he was unequivocally dead 

392.06 395.16 B: right that was never it wasn't [laughter] 

392.80 405.96 A: i never i never once heard that you know that they had a body or you know i put it you know i with just talk about the gazillion ways that we can get news i've never once heard that there was a body 

397.82 398.63 B: right 

406.10 408.74 A: and and you know 

408.79 412.42 A: i don't know it just i don't know [laughter] it makes you wonder 

412.31 420.07 B: right and i think they've known all along like i said with their levels of intelligence i mean they're saying like ex generals 

420.57 426.80 B: are giving them this information that had um went into exile before 

427.50 431.96 B: um they had been in exile and under cover er you know these are their informants
