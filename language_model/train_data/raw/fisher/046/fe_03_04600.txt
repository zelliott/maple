73.19 74.24 B: um 

74.31 85.25 B: it's uh in p- [laughter] this is a long story well it's a short story but uh it's in it's in portuguese it it's it's filmed in brazil

448.73 456.80 B: no it's not a you will not well you will like her 'cause it's a great movie but it's like so uh the movie's offensive it's about drug addiction 

456.46 457.57 A: mhm 

456.97 464.90 B: she plays this woman who's addicted to starting off with diet pills and it and she decides she gets a chance to be 

464.77 477.57 B: uh like a a a middle aged starlet or or to be on a game show or some sort of a show and so she wants to lose a bunch of weight so she takes all these drugs and gets hick- hooked on these drugs 

477.42 488.42 B: and [laughter] and she goes through these bodily changes and she just loses her whole life her lo- whole life consciousness i mean 

482.55 483.51 A: mhm 

488.59 498.30 B: that's she's just one of several characters in this that are destroyed by drugs and it is such a powerful film that 

498.31 507.72 B: the only way you're gonna this is never going to be broadcast requiem for a dream it's been with us about four years ago now at least f- three maybe three or four years ago

507.97 510.14 B: that she got that academy nomination 

510.13 513.47 B: it has never been broadcast i don't think it's even been on h._b._o. 

513.34 521.08 B: it the only way you're gonna see requiem for a dream is if you rent it because it is so powerful i- i- it's so 

520.89 533.90 B: shocking that that young people uh even though it's a good ant- it's it's really an anti drug movie but it is so personal and shocking that uh they they couldn't put that on the air

552.04 562.05 A: like that [laughter] and i like scent of a woman because uh al pacino takes except for the little boy you know he does- he doesn't have family and he's powerful in that movie 

561.67 575.20 B: oh yeah big bits but see he he has this he has that little thing he does several times it actually got a little old but he has that little thing that little sort of mannerism that he did you know [lipsmack] that was kind of fun let's
