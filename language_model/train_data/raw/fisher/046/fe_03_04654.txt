55.78 58.78 A: the evening news i listen to the radio 

58.86 61.09 B: yeah 

59.30 65.51 A: and uh i hear a lot of news from just word of mouth but you know how accurate that is is 

66.48 68.86 A: [mn] uh remains to be seen [laughter] i

86.36 87.91 A: (( mhm )) 

86.97 100.71 B: um but w- when i get home it's usually pretty hectic trying to get dinner on the table and solve the kids' problems [laughter] and all that kind of stuff so sitting down in front of the t._v. at six o'clock it's usually eight and all of a sudden it's eight o'clock and you know 

100.63 111.59 B: i'm cleaning or washing or sweeping so i i miss that so um a lot of mine is online um and it saves me a lot of money too because of all the newspapers i don't have to buy 

104.00 104.71 A: (( mhm )) 

111.54 112.46 A: right 

111.85 117.74 B: you know um you can get just about any of 'em on the internet and uh it's kinda hard to 

118.43 119.71 B: go from 

119.85 132.37 B: one uh story to the next it may not have all the pictures like they have in the newspaper i like to look at the pictures to go along and put a face with the story sometimes they don't have that so i miss the newspapers i mean 

131.48 134.04 A: so online they have daily events 

133.83 145.48 B: yeah th- you know there's several different ways like online say for instance if you've got a computer and um you use uh netscape is what they call your server i don't if you're if you use a computer at all 

145.24 148.00 A: no i don't i need to 

145.87 146.83 B: um 

147.58 151.58 B: well it's it's really great i mean i i do all kinds of stuff on the computer 

151.63 154.78 B: but say for instance you want to read a newspaper 

155.01 166.22 B: but when you first sign you when you first get on the computer and uh what the homepage or whichever one that comes up first like mine's netscape i'm looking at it right now and they have um 

166.84 172.92 B: clips from all different places in the news they have a wo- a section like maybe on the uh 

173.11 174.16 B: um 

174.81 180.46 B: oh they had some bombs uh [laughter] i can't even thing where it was the al kieda thing 

180.11 181.82 A: yeah 

180.52 186.72 B: and then maybe they'll have something about uh one of the movie stars a little story about the movie stars something up to date 

186.20 187.05 A: (( okay )) 

186.67 191.32 B: and then maybe they'll have something about what bush is talking about you know just little headlines 

191.17 202.56 B: and you click on that and it may take you to c._n._n. or it may take you to a._b._c. or you know something like that or you can go to the search you know different places different companies that will search 

202.73 206.57 B: websites for you and you put in a word like maybe um 

206.66 210.97 B: maybe you put in n._b._c. and it'll bring up n._b._c. or like um 

210.99 221.71 B: maybe uh i live in north carolina and a popular paper here is the fayetteville observer times and you put in fayetteville online and it'll bring you the front page and everything right off the newspaper 

221.32 222.14 A: okay 

222.09 224.77 B: and so you can read stuff and you can get you 

225.00 237.03 B: uh classified information and what's going on in the world and local and everything that way i don't have to buy my hometown paper the fayetteville paper the raleigh paper [laughter] but still you miss all the little 

237.27 247.84 B: the little stories you know that doesn't make it onto the website and i i miss that because sometimes something's going on that i need to know about so how many papers do you take or
