210.61 216.16 B: um make i know it probably makes you feel really connected to your neighbors but does it make you feel more informed also 

216.40 222.85 A: yeah i mean it's nice to kinda know what's going on we don't have kids and most of the people around here have kids 

222.21 223.29 B: right 

222.95 225.16 A: so we sort of feel 

225.69 229.31 A: you know sometimes we feel like we're not really in the main stream 

228.80 229.91 B: right 

229.40 234.44 A: with all the you know going to kindergarten and everything that you know the parents do 

232.44 233.34 B: uh-huh 

233.91 235.21 B: yeah 

234.51 239.74 A: so it's kinda nice to to see you know what activities are going on for the kids 

239.87 244.79 A: and so to that extent it keeps us kind of plugged in and informed 

244.32 256.85 B: uh-huh that's nice that's nice yeah well i know that um where i live [cough] you know we we sometimes you know of course we chat with our neighbors you know on the block and we you know sometimes gets news 

256.89 268.37 B: um from them you know about what's happening around the area and stuff we kind of keep each other informed and you know that informal network and um that's kind of nice makes us feel 

262.84 263.81 A: yeah 

268.34 272.05 B: connected and of course we chat about other things too but you know 

272.16 277.09 B: anything that might concern us we talk about you know locally you know

300.19 303.39 A: yeah it's y- you know it's a little generic i guess mm mhm 

302.78 314.20 B: yeah yeah that's true um sometimes they have interesting stories but it it's it's super duper political you know it's heavy duty politics usually on those programs and i don't really like that stuff 

314.66 316.87 B: um you know what i mean 

317.23 321.82 B: it's like they spend such a you know i mean if you're really into politics it's a great great thing 

321.59 325.12 A: right yeah it all kinda seems a little inside 

325.15 332.30 A: i sometimes get the feeling that you know like all these reporters sort of know each other and know the people they're talking about 

331.74 337.25 B: [laughter] that could be that could be yeah yeah um
