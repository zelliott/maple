113.77 115.75 B: really 

114.81 118.77 A: yeah i've been trying to get um i was the one i really wanted to get was uh 

119.05 120.43 A: vice city 

120.83 122.91 B: oh yeah that game's awesome 

121.88 123.25 A: grand theft auto 

123.51 126.11 B: yeah we've got that on the p._s. two 

126.31 127.66 A: yeah 

127.65 128.59 B: um 

130.07 132.76 B: so you download your games off kesar 

132.36 133.56 A: yeah 

132.95 137.60 B: that's cool i i mostly use kesar for music 

137.47 138.19 A: yeah 

139.54 141.44 A: yeah do you have high speed connection 

141.21 144.06 B: uh yeah it's a t. one 

144.21 145.31 A: yeah 

144.65 146.83 B: that's pretty fast 

147.91 151.30 A: yeah i guess they're um i just heard recently they're trying to um 

151.74 153.67 A: stop a number of 

154.45 156.08 A: recording industries now 

156.67 158.28 A: using fake um 

158.40 162.21 A: uh they're just basically trying to sabotage those uh sites now 

163.52 165.41 B: oh really 

164.92 167.37 A: yeah they there was some judgement um 

167.46 169.23 A: in favor of uh 

170.07 172.98 A: i can't remember the name of the company but it it's basically um 

173.57 176.34 A: i think it's a romanian company basically it um 

177.15 179.51 A: it's behind i think kesar and a couple 

180.90 185.15 A: or morpheus i'm not sure they're based all based on the same technology from the same company 

184.93 185.91 B: uh-huh 

185.71 190.54 A: but anyway that company got a judgement in favor of them that they weren't doing anything wrong which is kinda strange 

190.65 192.90 B: oh that they weren't doing anything wrong 

192.75 195.53 A: yeah basically because it's not 

194.96 196.43 B: yeah 

195.70 198.86 A: basically because it's not the same as napster they don't use a 

198.83 199.83 B: yeah 

199.29 201.82 A: a um a centralized server so 

201.03 210.15 B: right there's some weird loophole where if the company isn't directly giving you the song like if you're getting it from other people then it's like no illegal 

208.50 209.57 A: yeah 

210.39 213.87 A: yeah so i guess they've uh that that was their hope they would uh 

213.90 221.02 A: kill the uh those companies so anyway because of that that judgement they're uh taking up more they're taking up more and more um 

222.25 226.11 A: effort in order to sabotage those because they're putting in fake um 

226.65 228.95 A: fake downloads and things like that 

228.38 230.08 B: oh really 

231.24 238.40 A: yeah yeah i'm pretty sure i'm sure if anyone wanted to sabotage it like any company wanted to like sony i'm sure they could pretty much do a good job 

238.58 240.51 B: yeah 

242.37 243.23 A: so 

242.87 243.43 B: (( [cough] )) 

243.81 246.69 A: you know if you spend all that time downloading a a 

247.58 252.69 A: file and it ends up being some some waste of time then people pretty much give up pretty soon 

252.56 256.97 B: yeah i've had that happen to me a lot but i don't really care that much 

257.10 258.24 A: yeah 

257.67 260.28 B: i just try and find another one that works 

261.96 266.75 B: so how long does it take to download your average computer game 

266.86 269.64 A: um probably overnight i think 

269.35 270.89 B: really 

270.56 271.63 A: yeah 

271.01 274.28 B: you've got the so you've got pretty fast internet too 

274.87 275.89 A: um 

276.16 278.24 A: yeah i'm trying to think where i 

278.35 281.08 A: yeah i had i had i think cable internet 

280.76 282.15 B: really 

281.57 284.42 A: when i was downloading yeah 

283.47 284.90 B: that's cool 

286.34 289.49 B: what kind of games have you been able to find on kesar 

289.84 293.99 A: uh i think kesar pretty much has everything i mean everything you could want 

294.55 295.82 B: i've never used it 

295.11 296.76 A: i don't know how um 

297.18 305.11 A: i i guess it's not possible like playstation two it's not possible to download something well maybe it is actually and then you can can you burn it to a disk and then put it in your playstation 

305.27 308.05 B: i'm not sure i'm not sure like 

307.32 309.47 A: because i have seen i have seen uh 

310.55 313.94 A: it i have seen games on there and it says playstation 

314.51 316.25 B: really 

315.79 322.61 A: but i don't know if that means that you i don't know what that means i kinda doubt i doubt that you can pirate those though 

318.54 320.15 B: yeah maybe uh 

322.97 324.17 B: yeah it 

324.37 330.71 B: i bet you could get a like a a modulator or something or i mean um 

331.92 338.70 B: what are those things called an emulator or something for your computer so you can play playstation games on your computer 

338.98 346.52 A: oh maybe that's what it is i just assumed that it was something you could burn to a uh a disk and put because those playstation two games come 

346.91 347.74 A: um 

348.10 349.90 A: they're on a c._d. aren't they 

349.91 351.95 B: yeah 

351.08 354.50 A: yeah i just assumed that that's what it was but you're right it's probably just a a i don't know 

358.22 360.25 B: i don't know i've got uh 

361.83 368.60 B: like i've got something on my computer where i can play a bunch of old arcade games like pacman and stuff 

368.00 370.20 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

370.28 374.20 A: so what do what do use your computer for for work or just mainly for home use 

373.73 376.94 B: um well i'm a college student so 

376.62 378.51 A: oh so it's handy to have it yeah 

377.83 385.71 B: yeah always writing all sorts of papers and most of the time i just surf the internet for fun though 

385.73 389.35 A: yeah did you um did you hear about the college students that got uh 

389.57 397.10 A: they got fined some ridic- well it wasn't that bad but they got fined for um downloading music through the university computer 

397.13 398.07 B: really 

398.14 404.07 A: yeah it's like one of the first how many people have been um done for i think they 

399.04 399.85 B: (( oh )) 

404.40 410.64 A: they ended up on some payment plan for like the next ten years 'cause they each had to pay i don't know twelve thousand dollars or something 

410.21 412.79 B: what i wonder what school it was do you know 

412.88 414.51 A: (( no i don't remember what it was )) 

414.68 419.03 B: 'cause i'm pretty sure like everybody does it at my school and they don't say anything 

418.45 425.29 A: yeah out of the out of the however many millions of users there are i don't know why they chose to go against after those people 

425.28 432.72 B: yeah they need to settle down about music and downloading stuff anyways 'cause people are gonna do it no matter what 

432.36 434.41 A: yeah 

435.63 438.89 A: i guess i mean it is i guess it is possible they could um 

439.57 442.91 A: i mean if they do manage the sabotage the stall sharing systems 

443.04 444.96 B: yeah 

444.09 445.98 A: i guess they could pretty much stop 

445.86 449.58 B: but uh that'd be illegal right 

449.32 451.41 A: (( them hm )) 

450.67 456.63 B: to mess with somebody's like like software and like website and stuff 

456.65 463.14 A: no i'm not not sabotaging that way but just um fill it full of uh useless files like millions and millions of useless files 

459.06 459.85 B: oh 

462.80 465.12 B: oh yeah 

466.54 471.22 A: and yeah i'm sure they'll figure out quite figure out what 

470.58 472.71 B: (( yeah so um )) 

473.19 476.74 B: what uh what kind of games do you usually download 

477.51 478.56 A: um 

479.67 484.65 A: no i mean i've only really ever downloaded a couple that was that wolfenstein and um 

485.69 486.74 A: and uh 

486.84 488.14 A: (( can't remember what other one )) 

489.00 494.79 A: but yeah those are the kind of the games i like games like you know the classic duke nukem type where you just uh 

494.57 496.10 B: yeah 

495.12 499.56 A: yeah you know i know i guess people get into the uh civilization 

499.58 500.61 B: yeah 

499.86 501.10 A: type of games 

500.72 504.08 B: yeah my sister's really into those like simulation games 

504.11 508.16 A: yeah uh i've tried a few of them and i know they're incredibly addictive but um 

507.87 509.82 B: yeah 

509.65 515.58 A: and it was kinda just like a little bit less real just looking at the little maps and stuff like that 

514.50 517.13 B: yeah have you played a game called max pain 

518.03 519.88 A: yeah i've heard of that

523.43 526.67 B: yeah it's a yeah it's really cool 

525.24 526.87 A: like the doom style where you 

526.92 528.91 A: just have a gun sticking out ahead of you 

529.49 536.37 B: yeah it's a yeah it's just one of those shot 'em up games but it's got some really cool bells and whistles you know
