0.99 2.52 B: hi i'm alex 

2.50 3.73 A: i'm oh anne 

3.74 5.26 B: anne how are you doing anne 

4.90 6.15 A: good how are you [laughter] 

5.97 8.22 B: i'm doing pretty good 

7.19 8.49 A: good 

10.36 13.36 A: [mn] do you like to tell you what do we do ask do you know 

13.66 22.23 B: oh okay i thought it was i thought we were going to wait for a beep or probably not we've got ten minutes to discuss the current topic how do we get our news 

14.54 15.24 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

20.85 22.39 A: oh okay 

22.44 25.86 A: all right cool [sigh] um so about the news and stuff was it 

25.24 26.60 B: (( r- right [sigh] [sigh] )) 

26.37 33.17 A: oh right i um i was getting the newspaper every day so now i'd say maybe the evening news or the radio 

33.96 41.99 B: really i prefer the newspaper the evening news [sigh] national news is good ah [sigh] [noise] local news is a joke [sigh] 

41.76 44.87 A: [lipsmack] [laughter] ah i agree [laughter] 

43.58 50.44 B: nothing but promotion for the latest s- shows two minutes of important news and the rest fluff 

50.37 63.88 A: [noise] yeah that's very true i also find it just very upsetting to find all the little crimes going on [sigh] sometimes it's like i should pay attention to it for safety awareness but other times i j- just don't it's too mi- mind boggling to hear of everything that's going on around everywhere 

64.28 66.13 B: (( [noise] right )) 

65.12 79.34 A: [sigh] [lipsmack] i do prefer national news [sigh] and ah sometimes though if i go without h- hearing anything about something i'm fine with that i don't have a hunger for it [sigh] 'cause i feel there's nothing i can do anyway [laughter] it's going to continue without me [laughter] 

79.04 80.90 B: right 

79.94 89.26 A: [sigh] [lipsmack] um [lipsmack] but i do sometimes i actually like reading the little time newspapers like the brooklea daily planet or something like that [sigh] um 

88.77 90.50 B: alternative perhaps [noise] 

90.28 96.65 A: y- yeah because they give you different insight or things that you probably wouldn't read about which i might find interesting 

96.43 102.47 B: [mn] those showing 'em i'm not familiar with them but i know some of them are a bit sl- slanted in their in 

96.84 97.86 A: (( ah [lipsmack] )) 

103.19 105.50 B: their news the angle they use [sigh] 

104.14 105.33 A: yeah 

105.54 116.34 A: i guess i just i get tired of hearing about abductions and batterings and murders and shootings it's just it's too much for me [noise] [sigh] so if i hear about like a little petty thief on a cor- 

116.22 127.33 A: you know a theft on a corner or or a burglary or a dog missing or something i kind of find that a little more [sigh] interesting and enjoy- sad to say but enjoyable [laughter] 

124.76 127.72 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] [laughter] so you want something a more lighter 

127.57 136.44 A: [laughter] exactly that's a better word [laughter] um but the slanty ones i'm don't really hold such an opinion so i know some people would read them 

128.20 129.00 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

136.24 143.00 A: the alternative ones and really [sigh] find a writer or or you know an editor which they really feel strongly for or against [lipsmack] 

142.81 144.19 B: right 

143.24 145.05 A: i i've never been that way really 

145.04 155.40 B: oh i like the alternatives ah though i take what they say with a grain of salt because [sigh] i know they probably have their own little political agenda too and ah [sigh] 

154.27 155.35 A: (( [sigh] [noise] [noise] true [noise] [noise] [sigh] [noise] )) 

155.99 163.74 B: it it's good because it gives you the [noise] different point of view one you might not have or been aware of 

163.17 163.94 A: true 

163.88 170.68 B: [sigh] but but ah you wonder how [noise] reliable they are how accurate the information is 

164.02 165.46 A: right 

170.41 171.45 A: (( [noise] uh-hum )) 

171.17 173.99 B: [sigh] versus some of the major newspapers 

174.00 175.42 A: [lipsmack] it does help you 

175.92 179.03 A: develop your own opinion for and against 

177.41 183.45 B: you need a little balance so you can pick and choose hopefully what information you feel is more [sigh] 

180.58 181.89 A: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

183.54 188.80 B: accurate what about ah the internet do you ever use that [mn] 

187.74 201.81 A: um not yet i don't have the internet at home [sigh] and so when i do it i use it mostly just for doing emails [sigh] and i'm just reluctant to open up all these news things because i just don't know what that's going to connect me to and what kind of spam i'm gonna get [noise] 

195.00 196.14 B: right 

201.92 204.11 B: [laughter] 

202.05 212.03 A: so um i i haven't really used the internet that because i don't that in that way because i don't have it at work [sigh] [lipsmack] i don't have it at home and then at work i really just do it to cor- to do correspondences [noise] [noise] 

207.75 208.76 B: right 

212.84 225.20 B: right [lipsmack] i don't think you can get too much ah spam if you subscribe to c- certain ones but [noise] a lot of them such as ah m._s._n._b._c. it's pretty much what you would get on cable t._v. [noise] anyway [sigh] 

218.98 219.80 A: (( mm )) 

224.89 236.25 A: oh okay when i do the hotmail you see the m._s._n. but i don't de- i don't pay for the service there where i work pays for it [sigh] um so it's difficult for me [lipsmack] do you use the internet a lot [noise] 

225.52 227.05 B: so if you get that [noise] 

231.79 233.06 B: right 

234.71 235.55 B: (( o- [sigh] )) 

236.56 245.91 B: ah for the news not that much only [noise] because ah it's a little slow [laughter] [sigh] i'd rather go with the newspaper or i can just change at my own [noise] 

241.45 242.34 A: mm 

245.92 248.11 B: change the page at my own pace [sigh] 

247.88 248.90 A: (( [noise] uh-hum )) 

248.98 255.35 B: or the radio i think is a bit better for news news stations [noise] listening to them versus 

255.22 256.56 A: (( [noise] [lipsmack] mm [lipsmack] )) 

256.08 259.29 B: versus t._v. news because 

259.71 262.48 B: [sigh] [noise] well for the local news i think it's better 

262.79 270.54 B: [sigh] [noise] ah because ah as i mentioned earlier local news as far as t._v.'s concerned [sigh] it's nothing but sensationalism or fluff pieces and [sigh] 

269.95 271.27 A: (( [noise] [lipsmack] [noise] yeah )) 

270.59 276.09 B: [noise] they spend more time talking about who's dating who or the behind the scenes of the latest [sigh] 

276.09 276.98 A: yeah 

276.73 280.81 B: t._v. movie rather than any talk about what's actually going on [noise] 

280.63 288.08 A: [noise] yeah [sigh] do you find that that when you read the news that you want it in the morning to start your day with or when you come home to read it [noise] 

289.02 294.37 B: [lipsmack] oh ah i like it in the morning because i don't always have the luxury of time 

293.82 295.82 A: yeah [laughter] i hear you 

295.22 302.84 B: [noise] so ah in the morning it's good it's just getting a [sigh] any of the radio stations that have the news on top of the hour 

302.70 303.96 A: (( [noise] uh-huh [noise] [noise] )) 

303.24 305.13 B: (( i get to listen to it and ah )) 

305.61 310.30 B: two or three minutes worth of is there anything important that went on overnight there [mn] 

310.49 313.22 B: that i like to know about [noise] 

310.97 312.52 A: (( [noise] right [lipsmack] then i find )) 

313.03 316.84 A: [lipsmack] i find ah david letterman's monologue is very informative 

317.33 328.92 B: [sigh] yeah but i've heard some some of their ah the information that he or leno would do i would hear the news story myself in the daytime [sigh] they don't always get it right so 

317.49 318.68 A: (( [sigh] he )) 

322.18 323.17 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

325.17 325.99 A: uh-huh 

328.36 331.65 A: [noise] oh really [laughter] okay good to know [noise] [laughter] [noise] 

330.38 331.33 B: so 

331.96 340.33 B: right they may have ah got some of the information wrong or all also because it's taped earlier in the day the news might have changed a little but 

339.97 341.11 A: [lipsmack] oh okay 

340.58 343.55 B: at least it doesn't depress you when you h- hear it [laughter] [noise] i mean 

342.54 345.41 A: [noise] right right [laughter] [laughter] 

344.00 347.57 B: they put that [noise] humorous spin to it [noise] 

346.65 349.29 A: [sigh] that's true that's very true 

349.77 353.94 B: what news magazines you try that time newsweek 

350.46 351.40 A: (( [noise] )) 

351.88 352.47 A: [sigh] 

352.34 366.96 A: at just [lipsmack] doctor's offices i mean when we were little we used my parents would subscribe to it [sigh] but i find now it's more ads or pictures and the layout is just not as informative as i would want it to be [sigh] and the stories 

355.41 357.15 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

364.48 367.14 B: [sigh] at the doctor's offices 

366.96 367.86 A: pardon 

367.64 372.08 B: the doctor's offices but they're four years old there [laughter] [noise] 

370.81 382.70 A: [laughter] true but it's more or you know in the supermarkets more of a skimming through [sigh] and if it's a major story that they've covered i already feel that it's already been rehashed to pieces through other 

382.84 384.10 A: [sigh] venues 

383.80 385.37 B: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

384.31 390.41 A: that i've got the whole picture through other you know piecemeal together of other sources [sigh] um 

390.70 401.96 A: so i don't but [sigh] i still do love getting the sunday new york times and reading like their week in review magazine i think that that's just quality and that really [sigh] that will satisfy me for the whole week 

402.90 411.64 B: [noise] oh okay [noise] if you ever get one paper i'd say sunday paper [sigh] i prefer the l._a. times myself or new york times 

402.97 404.04 A: um 

410.71 416.09 A: [sigh] uh-hum [lipsmack] oh my neighbor gets it and i get it when she's done and that just keeps me busy 

416.15 428.39 A: [lipsmack] and i i feel that that they're awfully very good opinionated articles and well written and you can really attach yourself to a certain focus [sigh] there to the editorial section or just their perspective i really appreciate [mn] [noise] 

427.75 433.40 B: [sigh] well that's one good thing about the ah internet though if you have the time and the luxury [sigh] you can 

434.17 435.07 B: (( get [sigh] )) 

435.17 439.47 B: ah newspapers such as the washington post and 

438.62 440.39 A: [lipsmack] oh really 

439.73 453.78 B: other ones right just going into web sites [noise] most of them it's that same newspaper's name [noise] [sigh] or even the smaller you know the your home town [noise] was [sigh] several states away or you no longer live there most newspapers are already on line 

453.78 457.80 A: [noise] [sigh] [lipsmack] oh is it an abridged version or it's the exact thing 

454.97 455.86 B: (( it's )) 

458.41 461.09 B: a l- lot of it's the exact s- [noise] 

461.44 464.46 B: well i don't know because i don't have anything to compare it with ah 

463.71 466.10 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

464.77 473.03 B: actually i couldn't tell you what [laughter] today's washington post would say or [sigh] or some the dallas morning news 

466.92 468.46 A: [laughter] 

469.81 471.37 A: (( [noise] [sigh] uh-hum )) 

473.12 479.07 B: [sigh] ah i imag- i imagine it's abridged [sigh] whether you can go more detailed i'm not sure 

476.00 477.28 A: (( [lipsmack] oh okay [mn] )) 

479.01 480.53 A: oh i plan 

479.34 480.81 B: (( [sigh] but [noise] )) 

480.79 487.90 A: [lipsmack] i plan to look into internet service so hopefully you know maybe i will explore that [sigh] if you feel that that's a good source then huh 

487.27 489.94 B: [noise] it's a good option to have 

489.33 490.32 A: yeah 

491.21 495.06 A: hm [lipsmack] what else did they give us options of [sigh]

520.08 527.68 A: [laughter] well my boyfriend's lined up for this and he just didn't feel like doing it so i picked up the phone because we've been getting these 

527.58 538.07 A: the recorded messages every night now i know it's like my alarm clock what time i know it's ten o'clock [sigh] when we get the message going [laughter] so i said i'm putting an end to this i'm going to pick up the phone tonight 

532.64 534.16 B: [laughter]

561.90 562.87 A: oh okay 

564.97 565.80 A: yeah 

567.86 574.13 A: yeah [lipsmack] i feel more guilt when i see the pile of papers pile up [sigh] and the recycling bin gets full 

572.25 573.50 B: (( [noise] [noise] well [noise] )) 

574.65 577.48 B: [noise] ah by the time i would get home

582.96 584.12 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

584.32 586.63 A: [lipsmack] i find it's hard to keep up with it

589.68 592.87 B: newspapers more ah for commuters [noise] 

593.71 598.85 B: that's why you see them popping out those that you can read in five minutes [laughter] from front to back

598.62 599.89 A: [lipsmack] 'cause how do you feel about
