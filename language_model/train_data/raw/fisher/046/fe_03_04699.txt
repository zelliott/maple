0.16 1.00 B: (( [noise] )) 

2.00 3.74 B: [lipsmack] hello this is rich 

3.28 6.64 A: [noise] [lipsmack] um hi this is bruce ah good to talk to you 

6.24 8.64 B: [sigh] [noise] same here bruce how are you doing today 

8.67 10.72 A: i'm doing well um 

9.75 12.20 B: good 

11.34 15.38 A: so do you have any particular hobbies that you'd like to talk about 

14.15 22.26 B: [sigh] [sigh] sure [sigh] i um [sigh] i could talk a little bit about photography o- or ah music or golf [sigh] how 'bout yourself 

21.97 28.84 A: [mn] um that's cool i i i w- was into photography for a little bit but right now i'm more into um 

29.03 32.19 A: computers ah and music as well [sigh] 

31.32 32.90 B: (( [noise] [noise] [sigh] i see )) 

32.86 34.45 A: so um 

33.48 37.28 B: [sigh] tell me about your your computer and music connection 

37.56 41.70 A: well um [noise] the two aren't that connected [sigh] um 

41.76 44.95 A: although i'm moving in that direction a little bit [sigh] 

44.92 58.43 A: ah for now with computers i just like to [sigh] mess around with them a lot um [lipsmack] i like to buy spare parts and put them together ah build them for my friends and you know save them some money and [sigh] um 

58.86 62.94 A: upgrade them just mess around with them to see how they work 

60.02 61.37 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [noise] )) 

62.26 67.02 B: [sigh] [sigh] mostly windows based machines or just exclusively yeah [sigh] [noise] 

65.43 66.28 A: yes 

66.29 70.52 A: [noise] um ah almost exclusively windows based machines ah 

70.60 75.55 A: macintoshes are nice and they have they're designed pretty well and everything it's just that [noise] 

75.93 81.26 A: they don't have they're not compatible with that many other machines so you can't really mess around with them as much 

80.65 89.53 B: [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] you know i am [lipsmack] i've ah used computers probably for about twenty years [sigh] and only in the last year or so 

89.46 97.19 B: [sigh] um mostly because it was forced on me [sigh] i had to s- begin a transition from windows to mac 

97.25 98.43 A: [noise] [noise] really 

97.77 100.57 B: [sigh] yeah and um 

101.21 110.38 B: [lipsmack] i i'm one of those people that never t- thought i'd ever use a mac and matter of fact i used to always [sigh] argue the point with mac users that they were behind the times and that ah [sigh] 

110.40 112.03 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

110.59 118.23 B: they should convert to windows and [mn] stop fighting it [noise] and now i've gone [laughter] completely one hundred and eighty degrees the other way [sigh] 

117.94 125.00 A: [noise] [lipsmack] really well the i mean apple they really do design some excellent things i mean i own an ipod [sigh] 

118.90 120.35 B: (( um [sigh] )) 

124.95 138.30 A: and it's just it's just amazingly well designed and ah the o._s._x. operating system [sigh] is also um very user friendly and everything it's just not as tweakable or um 

127.55 129.05 B: (( [sigh] yes [noise] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] )) 

138.55 143.97 A: you know it's just not i mean granted windows is prone to crashing and bugs and stuff 

142.94 144.81 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] s- sure [laughter] )) 

144.31 158.32 A: everyone once in a while but um [noise] you know i yes definitely and and to me [noise] that's kind of part of the fun of it too i know most people hate that stuff but again i like to dabble in that [noise] so it really doesn't bother me [sigh] too much um 

146.61 148.54 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] less so now [sigh] [sigh] [noise] )) 

152.42 153.95 B: [laughter] 

154.80 155.95 B: (( i see [sigh] [sigh] )) 

158.40 168.92 A: i i used to do macintoshes too ah but i just wish [sigh] they were ah p._c.s because that's [sigh] what most of the people [noise] i knew were using and [noise] ah [noise] 

166.91 180.71 B: [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] it's a lot easier to you can be more competitive mac apple's so controlled their machines [sigh] and so controls their distribution [sigh] you really you can't even build your own m- mac really if you wanted to and [sigh] 

169.66 170.50 A: (( [noise] )) 

173.01 174.78 A: yeah exactly [noise] 

179.81 183.76 A: exactly that's that's my b- biggest issue basically [noise] [noise] 

182.92 185.89 B: and with windows you can do whatever you want 

186.42 189.84 A: yep oh speaking of the ah music connection um 

186.80 187.66 B: (( [sigh] it's )) 

189.07 190.99 B: (( yeah [sigh] [sigh] [noise] )) 

190.21 191.48 A: i ah 

191.88 192.69 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] )) 

192.27 203.04 A: to sort of combine my two hobbies [sigh] um one of my friends ah ah i'm in college right now and um one of my friends just graduated and he is trying to um 

203.32 204.31 A: (( ah )) 

204.31 211.62 A: get signed with a record company and so he wants to put out a really good demo c._d. he's in a he's in an excellent band [noise] he he's very talented [sigh] 

211.15 212.61 B: (( i see [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [noise] [sigh] [sigh] )) 

211.42 223.20 A: but um he needs [noise] but he doesn't have enough money to rent a studio [noise] so he has to um [noise] he's going to try to do recording on his own [noise] he has most of the equipment but what [noise] he needs is a computer [noise] that can run everything that he needs [noise] [sigh] um 

223.02 237.94 A: namely there's a software called pro tools [noise] um which [noise] basically records fixes edits music [noise] it's you know basically what all professional studios use but [noise] he'd have a very specific type of you know powerful ah 

237.95 243.73 A: pc to run that software and ah [noise] so i'm going to help him out with that over the summer 

242.74 246.66 B: [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] what does the software itself cost a- approximately 

244.23 247.47 A: (( [noise] [noise] um )) 

247.53 250.50 A: i believe it costs around five hundred dollars [noise] [noise] 

250.41 258.39 B: [sigh] [lipsmack] and the set up would be [sigh] does the does the computer actually function like t- the sound board [sigh] or 

257.20 258.45 A: (( [noise] um )) 

258.32 270.05 A: well it [noise] [lipsmack] you you really can't replace the [noise] entire soundboard [sigh] but [noise] um i i've [noise] ah been at studios [noise] recording studios [noise] before and um 

262.14 263.81 B: (( right [sigh] [noise] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] )) 

269.82 278.72 A: basically in the studios during [noise] the recording phase and everything [noise] they they pretty much [noise] exclusively use pro tools i mean they'll set the board a certain way 

278.56 288.83 A: [noise] then they'll then they won't touch the board for the entire rest of the recording session they'll just use pro tools [sigh] but when it comes to when it comes to mixing [noise] um a board will 

283.24 284.73 B: (( oh i see [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [noise] [noise] )) 

288.84 295.40 A: greatly cut down on the time it takes [noise] to mix it and you know you can [noise] you can you can 

295.52 300.07 A: get a lot more exact with a board but with this software you can 

300.09 300.99 A: (( you know )) 

301.15 303.06 A: it it's a very good substitute 

302.96 306.33 B: (( [sigh] oh i see [sigh] a lot less expensive than [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [noise] )) 

305.34 308.99 A: [noise] [noise] absolutely yeah a board would costs thousands and thousands of dollars [sigh] 

309.22 314.57 A: and you know this the wh- and the whole computer set up i mean i i'm going to be using some of his 

314.71 324.77 A: some parts from his old computer [noise] and [noise] just going to be getting the [noise] necessities for his n- new computer so he's going to get [noise] a computer that can actually run the software which 

324.59 335.36 A: is very demanding [noise] but um the whole thing should cost him ah under twelve hundred dollars when all's said and done including the price of the software so 

334.49 337.63 B: [noise] and that would be versus how much again 

335.79 337.23 A: (( [noise] )) 

337.28 342.24 A: [noise] um [lipsmack] versus hey like untold thousands of dollars 

341.29 344.87 B: (( [sigh] [laughter] oh i see [sigh] i see [noise] [sigh] [sigh] [noise] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [noise] )) 

342.71 345.50 A: for for getting a board and everything [noise] 

345.48 350.89 A: and just to rent out a studio i mean if you're going to if you're going to do a demo c._d. with say 

350.80 361.67 A: five or six songs on it and you're really going to do it right the best way to do to do it is to rent out a studio for [sigh] you know a certain number of hours and that'll that'll cost you around ten thousand dollars 

361.13 362.82 B: wow [sigh] [noise] 

361.97 366.00 A: so [noise] it's just yeah it can get kind of ridiculous [noise] [sigh] 

366.53 368.56 A: so he'd much rather ah 

368.83 375.19 A: record and then [noise] ah [noise] spend days or weeks even [noise] mixing it himself 

375.05 377.08 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] [noise] [sigh] [sigh] [lipsmack] and is [sigh] )) 

375.46 378.21 A: [noise] than shelling out that kind of money [noise] 

377.14 387.01 B: is the recording was is is the is the computer just used for [sigh] post recording is it is it used actually during used during the recording [sigh] 

381.37 382.56 A: (( [noise] )) 

384.09 385.40 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

385.71 396.14 A: [noise] um well [noise] actually [noise] the computer does a lot of the recording but [noise] because um [noise] there's so much information being recorded at once 

395.76 396.81 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] yeah )) 

396.21 400.88 A: other times you have to get a special type of external hard drive d- designed for 

401.33 404.23 A: ah this type of stuff um [noise] 

402.73 406.27 B: [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] is that f- for space and speed requirements 

406.66 410.51 A: ah excuse me [noise] oh for the computer [noise] ah yes there's 

408.37 409.61 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

410.44 422.55 A: there's a lot of hard drive space needed and the and the biggest thing [noise] is you need lots of processor speed and m- memory [noise] you need [noise] tons of ram [noise] um yeah but ah [sigh] [noise] but i mean 

416.33 417.48 B: (( sure [sigh] [sigh] )) 

422.52 429.96 A: the the most ah experience i've had in the studios i'm in an a capella group and that's probably the most demanding type of 

429.91 442.84 A: um recordings that they have at these studios because [sigh] we have about fourteen or fifteen people all r- recoding at one time simultaneously and so the computer has to record you know fifteen different tracks at once 

442.21 443.89 B: (( [sigh] [mn] [lipsmack] i see [sigh] [noise] )) 

442.76 445.80 A: but he he [noise] probably won't need that um 

445.95 452.13 A: you know anything that demanding because [noise] um when for most like 

452.10 453.16 A: um 

453.03 458.13 A: [noise] i guess just rock bands and everything [noise] or just most recordings in general [sigh] 

457.91 470.61 A: they do it by layer which means they'll [noise] just like record the percussion [noise] and then they'll record the guitar part and then they'll finish off r- recording like the lead vocal or something like that [noise] so it's not as demanding 

469.89 472.77 B: [sigh] [noise] is it compressed while it's being recorded [sigh] 

472.44 473.91 A: [noise] um 

473.99 480.17 A: it it well you can choose to do that but it'll decrease the qu- the quality a lot 

478.40 479.35 B: sure 

479.50 480.82 B: (( [sigh] right [sigh] [sigh] )) 

480.34 487.68 A: so it it i know that at the studios i've been in [noise] they definitely don't compress it [noise] and i'm going to try to 

487.94 495.51 A: um set up this guy's um machine so that it [noise] he won't have to do that too [noise] because that can really [noise] ah put a damper on it [noise] 

495.23 499.36 B: how much of a what size is the hard drive [sigh] w- will you be using 

499.37 502.80 B: you say he'll be using an internal and external hard drive [sigh] 

499.55 500.71 A: (( [noise] um )) 

502.54 515.59 A: well [noise] i i was well the thing is that it all depends on the type of budget he gives me because um he hasn't told me um [mn] how much money he has to you know use on this computer [sigh] 

507.67 508.70 B: (( yeah [sigh] [lipsmack] )) 

515.93 525.46 A: but i- ideally what i would like to do is get two eighty gigabyte internal hard drives [noise] and stripe them together as one [noise] hard drive 

525.37 526.53 B: i see 

525.85 527.19 A: and um 

527.23 537.46 A: that will record it'll record twice as fast that way [noise] and there'll be a lot of space [noise] and then if that's not enough i'll you know think i'll recommend to him 

537.49 539.10 A: getting a ah 

539.13 541.47 A: an external hard drive [noise] as well 

540.46 545.96 B: [sigh] [sigh] [mn] [mn] [lipsmack] and the ram you say is h- how much how much ram would you like to [sigh] is it a gigahertz wh- [sigh] 

545.40 558.38 A: [noise] [noise] ah well let's see the the processor ha- probably has to be around at le- at least two and a half maybe three gigahertz and then [noise] he'll probably need between 

558.26 563.23 A: five hundred twelve and one megabytes and one gigabyte of ram 

561.65 564.16 B: (( [noise] [noise] [sigh] [sigh] [noise] [noise] [sigh] i see )) 

563.82 566.87 A: so it's a lot [noise] 

565.53 569.41 B: [sigh] [noise] yeah that speed on that chip is probably going to be expensive too [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [sigh] [noise] 

569.19 574.86 A: yeah definitely well ac what i'm what i was thinking about doing instead is is getting um 

574.94 575.89 A: is 

576.18 584.43 A: getting [noise] a a mother board that can handle two processors um because [sigh] some software and this this one pro tools software actually does 

584.54 587.55 A: w- work with two processors at once so th- 

587.17 588.96 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] [lipsmack] amazing [sigh] [mn] [noise] [sigh] )) 

587.59 596.25 A: [noise] that'll cut down on costs [noise] but but for most people getting a dual processor machine is just completely [noise] impractical because 

596.70 599.89 A: the only programs that use that are video editing and
