18.85 21.58 B: okay and wh- what do you do in that game 

20.87 28.72 A: uh actually you uh you get these tiles that come down they look like scrabble tiles and you form words and get points for 'em 

28.65 36.19 A: and they throw in some burning tiles that come down and if you don't you know get use 'em for words then they eat up all your tiles 

36.05 37.73 B: huh that's okay 

36.46 39.02 A: and it's it's kinda fun it's uh 

39.09 41.13 A: it expands my vocabulary 

41.05 47.04 B: no definitely that's uh i'm pretty surprised to hear um of someone playing an academic game i must say 

45.55 48.14 A: [laughter] 

47.08 57.06 B: when i heard the topic i it just struck this like um tangible like um many of the the games are today are very aggressive and um 

56.06 57.80 A: (( very very )) 

57.43 62.27 B: very violent and very male dominated and 

61.27 63.78 A: [laughter]

86.15 87.18 A: mhm 

87.94 95.83 B: 'cause i'm i'm really out to have fun when i play a game i'm not looking for the graphic details realism and what not i think 

90.98 92.27 A: right 

93.26 94.28 A: right 

95.88 101.54 B: i mean that's what dominating um the game realm these days is how real it looks and how 

100.25 102.44 A: how exactly 

102.47 103.64 A: my um 

104.04 105.13 B: yeah 

104.05 107.67 A: one of my sons is into that very very much so uh 

108.79 112.59 A: he does quite a few hours a week playing those type of games 

112.37 113.93 B: right right 

113.94 121.43 B: well what would you um so y- you play mostly um academia type style games on the computer on the internet 

119.45 120.67 A: um 

120.91 134.32 A: i think probably seventy percent the other is some are the the puzzle games that i download from the internet and then uh i have some c._d. rom games with card games hoyle card games that kind of stuff it's just relaxation 

134.58 136.79 A: type games uh nothing 

137.07 140.14 A: [laughter] really too mind boggling and um 

139.33 140.30 B: uh-huh 

140.49 144.87 A: that would really tire me out because i sit down to relax and that's it 

144.87 147.64 B: very good very good 

145.60 146.92 A: (( and um )) 

147.43 152.79 A: mostly uh there's just two of us here and that's what generally we do we have two computers so

166.66 167.78 A: oh really 

167.77 181.18 B: and um i think that's a really interesting form of playing chess because you connect with um several different levels of chess on the internet with different people and it's a game that i think i don't know is very stimulating 

181.85 189.34 A: i have heard that it was i i only know the very basis of chess and that was back i mean years ago when i i 

189.43 191.16 A: first learnt to play it 

191.10 192.02 B: uh-huh 

191.20 196.25 A: and it was all the rage in the seventies big time you know that along with backgammon 

196.31 197.88 A: (( but um )) 

196.43 198.66 B: uh-huh right 

198.99 210.14 A: never played it on the internet i haven't played it in years so i'd probably just be really lost [laughter] in the moves i remember the names of the pieces and where they sit i could set up the board but that's [mn] you know but that's that's interesting do you play with the same people all the 

204.12 205.60 B: [laughter] 

206.22 208.52 B: oh it would be pretty easy to pick it up 

210.73 212.42 B: [laughter] 

210.96 212.54 A: (( time uh no the )) 

212.73 215.94 A: (( actually um i do a random select and it's someone that sits kinds ))

220.76 221.89 A: (( like my level okay )) 

221.26 224.70 B: and we connect and just play a l- game of chess 

225.02 228.17 B: and um have little dialogues here and there you know 

228.01 230.41 A: okay so now that you don't have internet then

237.43 238.37 A: mhm 

238.38 244.74 B: i don't you know if i'm gonna do something i'd rather read than play a game you know 

242.18 243.26 A: okay 

244.84 249.78 B: if it's just a simple game just to kinda pass the time like frog or something then

249.20 250.16 A: mhm 

250.17 253.06 B: then i like that but nothing too 

251.79 253.81 A: (( that's understandable [laughter] )) 

253.44 257.12 B: time consuming and detailed graphics and all that you know 

256.67 258.62 A: definitely definitely

292.85 295.50 A: maybe vacation or something like that 

292.93 294.18 B: very good 

295.94 297.05 A: (( but uh )) 

297.23 298.07 B: (( [cough] )) 

299.30 300.95 B: yes so 

299.97 305.37 A: it's hard to keep up a a ten minute conversation about do you play computer [laughter] games 

302.77 304.68 B: right [laughter] 

306.77 309.86 B: [laughter] like we have to find something to say about computer games 

308.56 317.07 A: [laughter] [laughter] other than what we already hit on that some of them are so stupid but 

311.97 313.06 B: um 

315.50 318.18 B: [laughter] 

317.36 318.79 A: what can you say 

319.08 322.04 A: i know my my grandson who's seven 

319.24 320.17 B: um 

322.41 323.29 B: uh-huh 

322.77 325.75 A: his their parents raised them on the computer 

326.09 326.94 B: uh-huh 

326.28 334.69 A: since he was able to almost you know sit up by himself he's being playing computer games but thank god they have basically been educational 

334.64 337.20 B: okay that's good 

335.05 336.85 A: (( but you know um )) 

337.51 341.35 A: numbers and math and and spelling that kind of stuff 

341.30 343.92 B: oh very good very good 

341.78 347.82 A: um thought provoking games which really surprised me 'cause i didn't think my son was all that academic 

347.83 350.57 A: when [laughter] when he was growing up 

350.62 351.49 A: (( but uh )) 

352.35 354.70 A: his wife is so that's that's a plus 

352.82 353.85 B: (( [laughter] )) 

354.97 357.97 B: yeah i think there are games that i mean like 

360.26 363.89 B: somewhat you know um scary 

363.27 364.37 A: mhm 

364.19 375.73 B: say to the least i mean just the contents and the direction of you know one shooter player i mean i think that might have a an effect on why violence is so great and why like 

374.60 378.08 A: okay i feel that way too i i really do 

378.54 388.93 A: and uh i mean you know like when you were talking about the atari games if you can remember i don't know how old you are when they first started you know it was just these two white blips going across the screen 

388.79 390.30 B: right yeah 

389.00 392.18 A: you know so how aggressive is that you know [laughter] 

391.84 396.30 B: there we go i mean it's a very fun [noise] game with like 

394.44 395.48 A: uh it 

396.05 399.06 A: it still takes strategy [laughter] exactly 

397.75 407.21 B: right right make your brain to work but there's no like message being told or stereotypes being formed you know which i think a lot of these games are doing today 

407.61 410.24 A: and the cost is just ridiculous 

407.81 409.74 B: (( which is very unfortunate )) 

410.42 411.44 B: excuse me 

411.12 413.08 A: the cost of the games 

412.79 414.29 B: oh it's a 

413.45 415.16 A: to buy the c._d. roms 

414.71 417.48 B: multi billion dollar industry i mean 

416.58 418.95 A: oh i wish i had stock i tell ya 

419.45 427.24 B: at the crazy m. um they say like seventy five percent of american population play and have like a video 

421.15 421.76 A: (( [laughter] )) 

427.17 439.21 B: game console of of some sort and that's just that's assuming one of them costs three hundred dollars you know plus whatever i mean it's a thousand dollars per individual who 

429.26 430.43 A: mhm 

438.96 447.15 A: exactly and they come with something a new accessory every year or every six months to go with that game unless they come out with a new version every year 

440.00 441.07 B: has one 

445.98 448.66 B: right that's what they always do right 

447.78 452.01 A: [laughter] i know it's always either add on or upgrade 

450.72 453.15 B: [laughter] 

453.98 456.26 B: perhaps we should have invested in those 

454.31 456.19 A: [laughter] 

456.31 457.29 A: oh when 

456.87 457.58 B: (( uh )) 

457.61 467.81 A: you were speaking of atari i looked up at my little game packs up here and we had bought an atari um disk set with all the old games on it and [laughter] like okay this is me 

465.67 467.39 B: mhm 

468.15 469.87 B: yeah
