64.27 65.46 A: mhm 

67.38 77.61 B: like the price ah that it cost at at the time i thought it was a better deal just go up to the arcade and play good video games instead of crappy ones [laughter] at the atari was putting out 

70.03 71.03 A: yeah 

73.68 75.17 A: sure yeah 

78.18 79.19 B: (( [mn] but ah ))

88.40 89.22 B: (( no )) 

90.71 91.58 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

93.14 99.25 B: i have to say that ah i'm not like somebody that's into it like i actually bought a playstation 

99.35 106.39 B: and that was the last console that i bought and all the new ones i haven't haven't been interested in 

101.45 102.18 A: (( mm )) 

103.91 104.56 A: (( mm )) 

106.69 112.22 A: but every time i go to the electronic store i i think about the playtoy ah playstation [cough] 

112.24 115.90 B: yeah there there are some games on there that are kinda fun but ah 

115.09 116.47 A: mhm 

117.04 122.68 B: like i guess you like you said when you get older you just kinda lose interest in 'em [laughter] 

121.97 123.77 A: (( yep yep )) 

123.16 125.27 B: you don't have the time to play 'em 

125.36 126.93 A: (( yeah that that's true )) 

125.52 136.60 B: although right now i could say i do have time to play the games but to be honest i f- i feel like the the quality of the games themselves like graphically and 

136.37 140.74 B: all that wise are like incredible but the actual fun of playing the game 

140.60 141.61 A: mhm 

140.80 144.73 B: has somewhat gone away like it's just not as fun as 

145.00 149.31 B: playing tetris even like i'm sure you've played that game [mn] 

149.42 151.02 B: have you played tetris 

151.41 152.52 A: (( [lipsmack] ah-hah )) 

153.31 160.05 B: that's just like a that's just a basic puzzle game where like the shapes fall from the top of the screen and you try and line 'em up and make 'em disappear 

153.55 154.43 A: that's 

160.21 161.40 A: mhm 

160.29 169.43 B: and when the whole screen fills up with the shapes the game's over it's like an incredibly simple game but to me that's like the best video game anybody [laughter] ever made 

168.84 169.72 A: mm 

169.57 170.48 B: 'cause 

169.81 177.77 A: well the games that i did look at i think i would like the the basketball game 'cause i'm more of new jersey net fan 

177.73 178.69 B: it's 

178.14 178.70 A: (( [mn] )) 

179.18 182.78 B: (( [lipsmack] ay i'm a s- i'm a i'm a fan [laughter] )) 

182.10 186.25 A: oh sorry guys [laughter] 

183.05 184.29 B: [laughter] 

185.46 187.58 B: oh well they deserved to lose 

187.78 190.30 A: oh yeah why did you say that 

189.77 190.97 B: um 

191.00 194.80 B: 'cause they couldn't ah they couldn't stop detroit from scoring 

194.02 195.50 A: (( hm )) 

194.76 209.07 B: well there was in game two iverson missed the two free throws and all they had to do they still were up by two all they had to do was stop 'em from scoring once and they didn't do that and the same the same thing in ah game five all they had to do was stop the guy from scoring and they couldn't do that 

203.51 204.87 A: (( right yeah )) 

209.21 212.19 B: and so that's how you lose lose 

211.56 213.44 A: yeah well maybe next year 

212.36 214.85 B: the series [laughter] 

213.98 215.30 A: [laughter] 

214.95 217.93 B: i don't the sixes aren't gonna do anything 

218.26 219.22 B: (( i don't know )) 

218.27 219.40 A: (( mm [mn] [lipsmack] )) 

220.46 224.96 B: but i i've played those games too it's actually kinda frustrating the sports games 

224.80 234.22 A: oh yeah well it it looked fun on the um [cough] advertisements that they put out that you can pick your team you pick your players and all of that 

225.73 226.68 B: yeah like 

230.56 231.56 B: it it's 

233.58 236.44 B: it's fun to an extent but it's 

236.89 241.98 B: but i don't know it's like they try and some of those games they 

242.06 245.53 B: on one hand a guy can like do a dunk from 

246.00 257.43 B: like through five peop- through five people and do a three sixty dunk and and it makes it and then you'll take like a three foot jump shot and you'll miss it you know what i mean it's not realistic that way 

246.89 249.03 A: mid court [laughter] 

253.61 254.92 A: mhm 

257.28 258.80 A: oh ah 

258.29 270.43 B: like and sometimes too like i i play more of the i've played more of the hockey games than the basketball ones but [mn] on plays that should score goals you don't score goals and then you'll score a cheap goal that shouldn't go in 

263.07 264.17 A: (( mhm [lipsmack] )) 

270.44 275.92 B: and i don't maybe they've gotten better since since i used to play 'em a lot but 

270.60 271.58 A: (( ah-hah )) 

275.27 276.88 A: how long has that been 

277.11 282.03 B: um like i said i had the playstation and the playstation two stuff so i used to play ah 

282.03 282.85 A: (( ah-hah )) 

282.05 288.33 B: n._h._l. and n._b._a. two thousand or nineteen ninety nine whenever that was 

288.17 289.07 A: mhm 

288.42 301.63 B: but that that'd be the most infuriating thing is like you would score a basket when you didn't expect to or score a goal when you didn't expect to and then when you made a play that in reality would score you would miss or 

291.01 292.25 A: (( oh yeah )) 

295.15 295.82 A: mm 

301.76 305.71 B: the guy would somehow miraculously block it on you or something like that 

306.27 308.86 B: [mn] the games are are fun to a certain 

307.96 316.01 A: yeah but [cough] they should be very much upgraded by now then a- from what i see it looks pretty exciting on t._v. but i just wouldn't have the time 

316.09 324.52 B: [mn] um that's that's kinda the nice thing about those sports games is that you can just sit down and play a couple of games and it'll only take you half an hour 

319.81 320.65 A: (( [noise] )) 

322.00 322.78 A: (( mm )) 

324.28 329.71 A: uh-huh but what i like about it too i would think [cough] that you can play with somebody across country 

329.54 340.71 B: yeah i've never really um never really done that even though i have i have the ability to i don't really i've never really done it for for one reason or ano- the other [laughter] 

332.64 333.66 A: (( ah-hah )) 

334.71 335.64 A: uh-huh 

336.56 337.35 A: mm 

339.81 340.90 A: [laughter] 

340.95 343.19 B: like ah i have played um 

343.35 347.59 B: like i'm sure you've heard of like the first person shooter games 

347.61 356.94 B: like ah quake quake is and the unreal tournament where you just you just see your gun in the f- in the bottom of the screen and you just shoot everything that moves [mn] 

347.93 349.52 A: mhm yeah 

357.40 359.33 A: yeah yeah 

357.42 361.50 B: um you can can get online and play and join 

361.56 362.64 B: games 

362.65 366.12 B: and ah people from all over join in those games and you play 

366.60 368.75 B: like just you for yourself 

368.49 369.82 A: mhm 

369.19 371.54 B: and ah or you can join teams [lipsmack] 

371.66 378.62 B: like and play games like capture the flag and other other things like that i've sort of done that but not really like ah 

379.88 380.92 B: (( i don't know )) 

381.34 387.53 B: it almost seems like you got it's too much sometimes like you'll be connected and there'll be a lag in the game 

387.48 388.18 A: (( mm )) 

388.06 392.16 B: and so like you're s- frozen almost to a certain extent and 

391.75 396.76 A: [cough] yeah what do you think about the games inside of the telepho- inside of the cell phones 

396.42 397.44 B: um 

398.08 402.40 B: it's just a good way to kill time i guess when you're riding the train or something [laughter] 

401.28 406.13 A: train yeah that's what most of them do up here in new york on the train they be playing the games yeah 

404.86 407.82 B: yeah i don't i don't have a cell phone so 

407.97 415.45 B: and but i i did try and play my friend's game once like he had snake and minesweeper or something on there 

415.03 415.91 A: (( mm mm )) 

415.47 424.27 B: those games are kind of lame [laughter] but ah yeah that's that's like supposedly the next [noise] the next ah frontier for video games [mn] 

423.85 428.53 A: [noise] oh yeah i think that the technology gets more advanced each year 

428.70 432.40 A: 'cause when i was coming up dick tra- we thought dick tracy 

432.49 435.49 A: [mn] on radio was a long way away 

435.02 436.23 B: [laughter] 

435.97 437.17 A: [laughter] 

436.28 447.09 B: they actually make something like that now i think but ah but the keys to punch in stuff is like so infinitely small i don't think you actually could type in much in it 

438.72 439.78 A: sure 

441.49 443.02 A: mhm 

447.20 460.40 B: them s- you probably heard of like the game boy advance and the game boys with their little tiny handheld things like s- i guess that's gonna merge into the cell phone eventually and so you'll have the same quality of 

447.73 448.32 A: (( yeah )) 

450.82 452.38 A: yeah mhm 

460.73 466.60 B: of video game play on your cell phone or it'll have like the expandable kind that you can make 'em bigger i guess 

466.09 467.29 A: mhm 

466.68 471.51 B: maybe get a bigger screen on there or somehow you can flip it out and have a bigger screen 

470.23 474.10 A: [noise] yeah i think they would have to improve on the bat- on the life of the battery 

473.92 475.25 B: yeah definitely 

475.11 476.14 A: (( mm )) 

475.64 481.03 B: like i'm always talking to the friends on cell phone and they're like ah my cell phone's gonna cut out in a minute i i gotta go 

479.82 481.72 A: (( [laughter] )) 

481.13 483.04 B: so when it does ah 

483.20 486.48 B: that's the end of our conversation [laughter] 

485.56 487.08 A: yeah
