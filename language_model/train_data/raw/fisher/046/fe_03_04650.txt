132.78 136.93 A: uh i don't know how many times they want us to say the same thing over and over again 

136.37 146.09 B: yeah [laughter] that's why i like to go online because there's different stories on there and it wasn't the same thing you know on t._v. it was over and over again 

145.64 147.05 A: right and you can 

147.19 152.20 A: look up more details on a certain story if you want that kind of thing 

152.22 153.36 B: yeah 

153.55 156.05 B: i get the paper every day so we 

156.46 161.20 B: get a lot of you know current events we keep up with everything through the newspaper too 

160.98 168.98 A: that's generally what i use 'cause i don't have the time to watch t._v. usually and um 

169.62 173.93 A: i generally try to make time to get to the paper every day 

173.64 174.27 B: (( hm yeah )) 

174.28 179.73 B: well my kids they usually take over the t._v. so i always like to watch the evening news

184.67 186.09 B: oh [laughter] [mn] 

185.46 189.36 A: so i'd have to watch the early show of the news 

189.88 195.39 A: but usually they have too much uh local stuff that isn't interesting 

195.67 196.79 B: (( yeah hm )) 

196.07 199.16 A: which is why i don't bother with the t._v. news too often 

200.25 204.62 A: unless there's something i know that's gonna be on the news that i wanna find out about 

204.96 206.85 A: 'cause i heard from 

206.91 208.84 A: somebody else or whatever 

209.95 216.00 B: yeah i went online a lot and you know i get different stuff online than what you get on the t._v. 

212.71 213.27 A: (( [cough] )) 

217.50 226.94 A: right and if you don't like what someone one place says you can call i mean you can uh look up a different one and see what they have to say it may not always be the same story 

218.32 219.07 B: (( hm )) 

226.40 230.51 B: yeah sometimes i'll listen to the radio too but not too often 

228.50 229.32 A: [noise] 

231.73 235.21 A: i hardly ever do because i listen to uh

237.51 239.84 A: my own music in the car 

239.28 240.04 B: hm 

240.03 242.66 A: that's about the only time i have the radio on 

240.06 241.08 B: yeah 

243.19 248.74 B: once in a while it's like if it's you know top of the hour news i'll you know switch it on to see what's 

249.27 252.18 B: on and see what the weather's gonna be and 

249.41 250.25 A: right 

252.48 257.06 A: yeah when the war was going on i was i had the radio on a lot more then 

257.58 260.91 A: to try and keep up to date with the latest developments

264.32 266.68 A: now that it's finally over with 

267.48 271.46 A: hopefully there's not a lot of late breaking serious things happening 

271.86 273.20 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

274.50 281.37 B: my husband he was amazed that he went online and you could all the stories that was on there and it was pretty interesting 

281.46 282.81 A: (( right [noise] )) 

285.19 286.60 A: have you been uh

299.29 300.78 B: was interesting 

301.64 302.31 B: hm 

301.71 308.97 A: but they uh they either ought to reduce the time or give you something a little more involved to talk about 

308.64 313.91 B: yeah [laughter] yeah ten minutes is i mean depend on a subject 

313.82 315.59 A: right 

315.05 318.37 B: the last time it went you know pretty fast 

318.81 324.29 A: yeah how do you keep up with the news is pretty much a one sentence answer and not a ten minute answer 

322.89 323.98 B: yeah 

324.63 325.93 B: it's either 

326.34 328.87 B: internet or t._v. or radio but 

328.68 330.66 A: right exactly um 

332.02 336.17 A: and there's just not that many choices but 

336.31 345.39 B: no i read one lady's her topic of the day was pets uh i mean i have a dog and a cat here so i could of talked a lot of that day 

343.96 347.26 A: uh oh yeah well you could go on for hours that way 

346.84 347.96 B: yeah 

348.35 355.32 B: something like this is really not a whole to say unless you're gonna talk about what was on the news today or [laughter] 

354.48 357.36 A: yeah but they that's not what they asked 

357.10 358.16 B: no 

359.04 363.53 A: but uh i guess they're supposed to come on and tell us when our time is up 

362.91 364.11 B: yeah 

364.23 367.61 A: or the recording will come on and tell us when our time is up 

365.43 366.31 B: hm 

368.43 374.94 B: i basically like to other people i mean my friends and stuff i don't talk to them about the news or anything 

378.70 381.16 A: [noise] i put it there uh 

381.97 383.81 A: well um 

384.14 392.34 A: let's see i've been reading the newspaper for a long time to get the news so i've sort of done it the same way for many years 

392.37 394.87 A: maybe they're interesting in that [noise] 

394.53 395.57 B: yeah 

396.32 400.31 A: so only be doing internet for the last couple of years but uh 

401.13 403.14 A: the newspaper [noise] you know 

403.18 406.27 A: [noise] newspaper's like the newspaper's like an old habit 

404.17 405.52 B: yeah i've been getting 

406.19 407.23 B: yeah 

407.38 422.29 A: it's hard to break [noise] and i don't like to s- sit at a computer monitor and read something long and involved off [noise] the screen [noise] and generally we'll print it out and and read it instead of sitting there in front of the monitor and reading it anyway 

422.02 423.18 B: yeah 

424.01 430.79 B: and basically my friends and that we don't talk the news really we talk about you know other stuff in our lives [laughter] so 

430.24 431.26 A: right 

431.17 433.34 B: basically mine is just from 

433.49 435.39 B: t._v. or the internet [mn] 

440.70 441.82 A: (( um )) 

442.03 443.89 A: well 

444.29 447.05 A: i guess there isn't a whole lot else i can tell ya 

447.33 451.89 B: no nothing for me really either should be up pretty soon 

452.11 459.85 A: yeah i forgot to look at the clock to see when the time was up i think i held on longer waiting for them to find somebody to talk to for ten minutes anyway 

455.80 457.08 B: mhm 

458.13 458.89 B: (( oh )) 

459.93 462.28 A: but i was busy doing something else 

460.85 461.65 B: hm 

462.90 467.12 B: usually i look into the t._v. once a day sometimes twice a day 

468.19 475.10 A: mhm yeah well we used to have two papers in town but haven't had two in a long time but i only read the one anyway 

472.82 473.81 B: hm 

475.21 478.01 A: 'cause i didn't have time to do it twice a day 

478.41 480.42 B: we only get one here 

480.66 488.96 A: we haven't had more than one in probably oh i don't know it's probably been along time now maybe five years or ten years maybe i don't 

488.65 489.38 B: hm 

489.49 491.37 A: who can keep track 

491.02 491.65 B: hm 

491.87 492.65 B: yeah 

492.74 499.19 B: we've only ever had one i live in a rural town and we only have one paper a day 

498.79 500.79 A: (( yeah )) 

501.14 507.77 A: yeah well i was away for the last few days so i'll be catching up on four days worth of news all at once tonight probably 

507.66 509.27 B: oh [laughter] 

508.81 514.24 A: that's one probably a bad part about only reading the paper unless you go buy the paper where you are 

514.37 515.44 B: yeah 

515.08 519.74 A: i usually don't have time to read the paper when i'm away anyway unless i'm 

519.76 523.04 A: like at the beach or something where i'm just sitting around all day 

523.49 527.74 B: we get delivered we have a paper boy and he delivers it every day so 

527.95 530.98 B: we usually home in the evening so we get to read it 

532.17 534.60 B: every night and 

534.69 539.45 B: usually i just skim over it if there's an interesting article i don't read everything 

539.12 544.53 A: right yeah just look for the headlines and see if the article's of any interest 

544.71 549.04 B: i mean when the war was going on more that's when we read the paper more [noise] [noise] 

550.75 553.44 A: i think everybody was more interested in it then 

554.32 556.73 A: but it came and went in a few weeks 

555.74 556.91 B: (( yeah )) 

556.78 558.21 A: thank goodness 

559.18 562.21 B: i'm usually online every day too so i 

562.44 564.56 B: [noise] read the headlines to see what's 

565.15 567.63 B: happening or new in the world 

570.47 571.37 B: (( [noise] )) 

573.04 574.98 B: shouldn't be too much longer 

574.58 579.08 A: [noise] no i think it's uh probably just about done 

579.21 585.08 A: i know i waited a long long time to get the cheque the first time i thought they'd forgotten about me 

581.88 582.51 B: hm 

584.40 585.08 B: (( hm )) 

585.24 588.52 B: i didn't have to wait only a few seconds 

588.82 592.63 B: i just punched in my numbers and then they connected me right away 

592.31 593.69 A: (( oh )) 

593.16 593.99 B: but 

595.73 599.89 A: well i guess that i i was the first person they were looking for and then they found me and then looked 

598.75 599.78 B: (( hm ))
