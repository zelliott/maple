4.34 5.66 B: i'm joseph 

5.57 8.04 A: okay i'm dave how are you 

7.66 8.92 B: i'm fine [mn] 

8.93 11.62 A: (( good [noise] um )) 

12.77 16.60 A: so do you play computer games no 

14.99 15.91 B: no 

16.76 24.23 A: okay well this should be interesting i i do a little bit but i'm n- not really big on it 

24.63 27.40 A: um have you ever tried any computer games 

26.97 30.16 B: no i have never tried any like i used to play the game boy 

29.99 31.09 A: (( [noise] uh-huh [noise] [noise] )) 

30.69 34.67 B: the regular game boy but computer game no i've never did 

33.89 42.01 A: okay well they they are similar to game boy it's just that really you have a bigger screen 

42.82 44.28 A: (( [noise] um )) 

45.15 50.03 B: i i believe like why i don't play them because i don't have a computer because i'm trying now to get a computer 

49.73 54.34 A: oh well it'll be tough to play computer games [laughter] without a computer wouldn't it [laughter] 

52.65 53.83 B: (( yes )) 

54.16 55.43 B: that's the problem 

55.28 56.55 A: yeah 

55.92 59.90 B: i believe i have a computer i'll be playing computer games but 

57.56 58.39 A: uh-huh 

59.44 60.80 A: okay yeah th- 

60.69 63.30 B: i do- i don't have no computer 

61.04 61.88 A: go ahead 

63.35 64.40 A: okay 

64.41 65.43 A: um 

66.48 69.22 B: (( so what basically you like about computer games )) 

68.92 70.14 A: say that again 

69.65 72.66 B: what basically you like about computer games 

72.44 79.93 A: um well i i mean like i do like game boy but y- you get a much obviously a much bigger screen 

80.14 83.80 A: and you get better graphics and i- it's more 

84.07 86.28 A: i don't know if i should say realistic but ah 

86.47 92.72 A: i- it's a better version of the games al- although it is similar and i think it's got the same basic 

93.57 95.13 A: idea 

95.41 98.45 B: so you think that computer games are good 

97.40 107.36 A: yes i do and i i enjoy it like i said i i don't do it a lot but when i do i i enjoy it my my son is big on computer games [laughter] 

107.37 113.72 B: well that's what i'm thinking about because like kids usually spend most or all of their time playing computer games 

113.80 115.90 B: do you think that is good for them 

115.36 117.35 A: (( ah i )) 

117.48 124.06 A: [mn] yes and no i i think it's good in that it helps them develop their skills using the computer 

124.37 131.05 A: but then i- if they want to sit in front of the computer all day and play games i i don't think that's [laughter] good for them 

129.97 139.59 B: mhm well because like i don't think computer games really are going to improve their skills in computer because i believe computer games when you just have to use like three or four buttons 

139.66 141.80 A: [mn] yeah that's that's true 

140.84 146.24 B: so like you not doing anything you just go forward and backwards shoot jump 

146.51 150.23 B: jump and reverse that's basically all th- all they're doing 

149.66 155.77 A: you know th- that is true [laughter] um i didn't really think of it that way but ah i agree 

156.05 167.12 B: i believe like computer games ah for me like usually for kids it's not doing any imp- no good to them because like being there all the time playing computer games 

167.56 170.32 B: they don't have time to read 

171.08 172.94 B: all they do is computer 

173.22 176.55 A: [mn] right um yeah that that is true i- it 

176.30 180.18 B: and the kids nowadays like they no- they don't play like games like 

181.43 185.63 B: (( they don't play games that use their head all they do now is computer )) 

185.85 191.57 A: ch- right yeah it ah i guess it does take away from other activities they they 

191.68 197.82 A: could spend their time on better li- like reading or [mn] or even working 

191.75 192.48 B: (( [noise] )) 

197.35 198.69 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

198.08 198.93 A: (( [laughter] you know )) 

198.86 203.79 B: and when you get addicted to that stuff you never want to u- leave your computer 

203.56 206.80 A: [mn] yeah that that's true um [mn] 

206.91 211.57 B: so that's really though i i believe that's u- usually your intelligence 

211.91 220.00 A: yeah 'cause you know the it's i there have been times when like i had to do some i had brought home work and i had to use the computer 

219.76 220.72 B: mhm 

220.10 223.14 A: and my son was busy playing a game and he 

223.35 225.22 A: doesn't want to give it up [laughter] 

225.87 228.91 A: ah so that that is a valid point [noise] 

230.16 233.75 B: (( and like you can't play most of them like can't play chess )) 

234.17 237.76 B: (( those games like they always ask them now you want to play chess on line )) 

237.77 244.37 B: you can't because it is no fun because they will be all the way out there you're all the way in here like 

244.76 251.87 B: you don't know when he's gonna move or not maybe so he's thinking it's better like you're seeing the person and okay you gonna move this 

251.88 257.05 B: this time you know like in five m- in two minutes but if you're playing like he's all the way there online 

256.95 257.81 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

257.25 262.62 B: you don't if he's gonna move maybe he's thinking he's thinking more like five ten minutes 

263.02 269.31 B: (( [mn] figuring out what to do and you be here boy so maybe he maybe he's not even there anymore )) 

269.12 272.58 A: [laughter] that's that's true [laughter] 

270.08 271.06 B: [laughter] 

272.16 278.73 B: you say maybe he's not even there anymore so why should i waste my time sitting there and trying to play this game 

278.16 279.79 A: yeah 

279.08 286.20 B: so i don't know i don't really i i hope i w- i really like i believe i would like playing them but 

287.34 291.81 B: it will not be fun for me i prefer watching movies sometimes or reading books 

291.64 293.15 A: mhm 

293.23 295.00 B: but that's not good for me 

294.76 297.54 A: [laughter] yeah um 

298.07 304.59 A: yeah to tell you the truth i i i do agree because ah most of the time i- if i'm playing a game on the computer 

299.72 300.51 B: what 

304.75 313.87 A: it's usually because i'm bored and i i just want to kill some time [laughter] and it's not really a constructive use of time 

314.27 319.49 B: but i believe a lot depends on the culture because i'm an african i come from africa sierra leone right 

319.16 320.22 A: mhm 

319.59 331.80 B: like most of the time even if you have a computer there'll be blackouts there'll be no electricity and if there is no lights you can't play computer game and sometimes you go out you go w- for weeks 

325.01 325.97 A: right 

331.97 333.52 B: without light 

332.93 334.06 A: oh wow 

333.76 340.55 B: (( so [mn] you can't even think about playing com- games you're come on man there is no time for this i just normally read my book )) 

340.86 342.43 A: mhm 

341.33 344.40 B: or play other games that you don't need [noise] 

344.86 346.66 B: or are physical games 

347.32 348.60 A: yeah um 

347.70 349.88 B: maybe play soccer or something else 

349.73 354.98 A: oh sure the physical games are much better for you to develop your motor skills [mn] [mn] 

353.52 354.72 B: (( yeah and )) 

354.91 358.17 B: (( i believe computer games leads to like obesity )) 

358.37 362.19 B: (( because like if you're playing computers [noise] there is no you don't exercise )) 

363.81 373.57 A: no y- you don't ah and ah a a physical game will will help you get exercise tone up the body develop team work and you know 

371.94 373.88 B: mhm 

374.22 377.60 B: (( wh- whereas with computer games you have none of that )) 

377.03 377.86 A: no 

377.60 391.29 B: like i just i saw some boys playing ball americans american football the computer just moving these guys and at the end of it they knew nothing they're just moving the guys they don't really actually take part in the process 

382.95 383.98 A: mhm 

391.74 395.58 A: right and that's quite true it's ah yeah 

395.14 398.13 B: all they do is press keys use the mouse 

398.59 404.16 B: they play all the game you know they're not even physical so at the end of the day i don't think it's really helpful 

404.17 409.02 B: because at least human being you need exercise and like most of them they go to school 

409.19 411.68 B: from school come home 

411.99 417.36 B: nothing to do just computer game but if you go out there this will be better though 

418.64 421.26 B: (( and these computer games are really expensive )) 

420.59 422.52 A: (( yeah ah it's amazing [mn] )) 

421.90 429.21 B: very expensive i was on playstation two the i think one hundred and fifty dollars i said come on man 

430.00 431.65 B: i don't need to buy this 

432.09 434.24 B: they are really expensive 

433.52 445.15 A: yeah and i yeah and there really is that does not seem to be that much to them that you know in as far as materials that make them or if anywhere near that kinda money [mn] [mn] 

444.58 450.92 B: (( y- yeah because when you look at the stuff it's not even worth it )) 

452.02 456.87 B: it's just that you just i don't know man and o- once you play it once or twice 

457.38 458.65 B: it's worthless 

459.00 466.59 A: oh that's another thing it's ah it's amazing how that the kids piles up a- all ah those games and they they you know they play it for a week or two 

467.01 467.57 B: (( [mn] )) 

467.25 472.21 A: then they get tired of it and then it's just sits there [laughter] [mn] 

471.58 473.86 B: (( yes sit there forever )) 

475.65 478.26 B: (( it's really really worthless )) 

478.46 481.64 B: and you spend a exorbitant amount of money on 

484.31 485.08 B: (( them )) 

485.62 486.39 A: (( hm )) 

487.32 490.73 B: why we need comput- well no you have to buy computer 

495.45 496.01 A: (( [mn] )) 

495.46 497.10 B: (( but at least it's )) 

497.16 498.27 B: (( if you are bored )) 

499.60 501.90 B: it really save time 

501.22 504.79 A: yeah that that seems to be really to me 

504.87 509.30 A: the only time i really do play computer games is i- if i'm bored or 

509.32 513.42 A: [mn] need to kill some time and i guess that in itself 

513.45 516.25 A: defines it as a waste of time [laughter] 

516.58 520.89 B: mhm it's a waste of time a big waste of time 

518.95 520.55 A: mhm 

522.88 524.52 B: (( get myself busy )) 

527.71 541.36 B: all this has been [mn] you kinda spend your hours if you go i- if you're like you are in the game you want to you want to score the highest you want to have the highest score so it's like yeah let me just keep playing 

537.80 538.63 A: (( hm right )) 

541.58 543.22 B: (( oh let me play )) 

543.48 545.79 B: and then you lose maybe you you 

545.90 549.28 B: (( already so okay [noise] let me try again )) 

547.89 548.77 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

550.22 557.54 B: and ah the more you play the more you want to get you want to get better and the more you want to get better the more you spend your time 

556.52 557.73 A: (( sure hm )) 

557.82 560.95 A: and really you know that's another point though um 

561.16 568.25 A: i- if you have a kid playing a- and he wants to get better and or or beat somebody else's higher score 

568.51 577.93 A: i can see that being demoralizing to the child too and ah where you know he wants to get better and sometimes he just can't 

578.11 581.59 B: yes and you know the people that are making the software 

581.75 585.73 B: once like you start playing this you have to buy all the series 

585.77 587.97 B: because they make it like a continuation 

587.97 588.99 A: sure [noise] 

588.50 597.19 B: once you d- whe- once you finish this series if you want to get better you must do the next so you parents with money 

597.56 599.89 B: when they finish they said mom i need this other one
