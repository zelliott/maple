127.59 132.23 A: that's you know and nobody seems to be addressing 

132.14 136.07 A: the economics it's like sliding around where 

135.92 148.45 A: you wonder are we really getting fed what we're supposed to be getting or thank god i have some brains that i'm able to use whatever knowledge and apply it to my lifestyle now 

148.41 157.07 A: you know it's it's very very frightening you know i you know we we're all under such stress with our jobs everything 

157.12 159.71 A: are you still working here in the city 

158.91 161.36 B: i'm at work right now talking to you 

161.02 166.04 A: oh my goodness yeah well i'm off unfortunately 'cause i had bronchitis 

165.36 167.54 B: all right well hopefully you'll feel better 

167.12 168.65 A: right but 

167.67 172.06 B: but i will tell you as far as the okay the world trade center hit us 

171.68 172.76 A: right 

172.57 177.13 B: and the the going after them hit us now with this iraq thing it's killing us 

176.63 183.09 A: i mean we've crept in and how i mean and the people are i mean i'm for humanity 

182.61 186.89 B: yeah i am too but not just at the united states' expense 

183.83 184.83 A: right 

186.54 187.88 A: right right 

187.06 199.80 B: it seems like you know we're leading this charge here it's supposed to be a whole u._n. based thing working together and i see one thing i see a lot of people not working i see i see i just see i'm watching everything just fall apart 

199.62 212.71 A: that's what see i i come from the old era and i certainly thought when i reached this point in life that i'm at that i would see things getting better than they even were 

203.48 204.41 B: okay 

212.20 213.39 B: right yes 

212.78 227.70 A: but now i don't understand it i never thought i would live to get this age and then see what's happening in our world now uh i i i just don't understand it's like what people that have jobs 

218.38 219.26 B: right 

227.68 234.17 A: they just don't oh they're not happy you're not getting the services that i used to get years ago 

233.65 238.76 B: well they're destroying the budget they're cutting everything and as for 

237.46 252.15 A: i work for the schools i'm a teacher so i am so hit i'm getting out i don't want to but you know what i would have worked another i don't know how many years but i feel i'm getting hit left and right in taxes 

239.04 240.14 B: okay 

241.67 242.65 B: all right 

247.81 248.85 B: right 

251.84 254.36 B: well it's not just taxes it's everything else 

252.18 252.90 A: i 

253.56 263.36 A: it's everything our rents our whole uh you know and and back to current events do you think it's because of all this stemming from nine eleven 

263.05 265.51 B: nine eleven was the crumbling point 

265.33 267.35 A: was the point of reckoning 

266.44 273.54 B: right because if you figure now over the years if you watch even through the different administrations in the city lindsay was a disaster 

271.37 272.36 A: right 

273.40 276.33 A: right [laughter] 

273.66 275.31 B: beem was a disaster 

275.52 277.88 B: hart's put the city back together 

277.64 279.44 A: right right 

278.82 285.68 B: and you know guliani pretty much kept it together but as far as financially but then nine eleven struck 

285.78 286.71 A: (( and )) 

285.85 289.48 B: and and the mayor we got now he thinks it's a big business 

289.01 289.77 A: [mn] 

289.91 295.98 A: this is what we're talking about even the current events that you see with the schools he 

294.66 296.25 B: yeah i know that's economy 

295.96 310.47 A: i mean does a businessman come into the school make a promise to our union ch- and our chapters and then just just dissemble the whole system that was wrecked because 

310.59 311.34 A: (( [mn] )) 

311.35 315.33 A: for many many reasons and i saw the downfall way back 

314.75 318.16 B: well well not for nothing i think the school system in the city stinks 

317.80 322.16 A: so what do you go along with what he says he's going to do the mayor 

321.39 325.46 B: no he think he got it backwards i'd rather see more garbage in the street 

325.21 326.31 A: right 

325.78 329.98 B: and i'd rather see less this and less that but leave the schools alone 

329.85 331.17 A: right it's it's 

330.52 335.83 B: i'd rather see less trains more garbage and school system improved 

335.76 339.20 A: so we can because these are going to be our future leaders 

338.57 340.56 B: exactly exactly 

339.96 343.81 A: and maybe what's happening with the leaders we have now 

344.10 349.04 A: it's because of no they came from well to do educational backgrounds 

348.33 353.16 B: well like i said bloomberg's a millionaires working for a dollar to be to be mayor 

352.91 354.31 A: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

353.54 355.51 B: personally i didn't vote for him 

355.27 356.41 A: mhm 

355.85 366.72 B: because i don't need a businessman running the city 'cause the businessman is going to do what he knows how to do cut cut cut cut restructure that's the let's hook up the corporations and make them stay here with tax breaks 

361.00 363.40 A: corporate money right 

366.24 367.60 A: (( uh-huh )) 

367.00 373.49 B: oh man listen listen it's just and then now too they're wasting all this money and time on the world trade center site 

373.35 374.41 A: right 

373.69 375.84 B: and they got nothing accomplished 

375.36 378.06 A: and nothing is there yet uh 

378.15 390.54 A: oh uh you know they're talking also as i saw there they want designs for memorials for the i'm just wondering if if why we just don't focus on one aspect 

389.93 400.65 B: it's a very simple solution i had it figured out build the same exact trade centers and on each floor as you get off the elevator whoever died on that floor their name gets inscribed in a marble wall 

392.33 393.34 A: tell me 

395.01 395.85 A: uh-huh 

400.60 403.71 A: you know simple sweet 

401.46 403.04 B: that takes care of it 

403.13 409.53 B: simple sweet right to the point and if somebody wants to visit all the names then they can get off at every floor 

409.34 411.46 A: and there can be a major one 

410.84 416.31 B: right and that's where that stops all the i've seen so many designs i think they're nonsense 

415.92 424.65 A: i i um i'm an art teacher and i've i've been an artist since i was in high school not to give away age 

418.70 420.01 B: yeah okay 

423.02 427.17 B: okay no no no that's fine we're not looking at age here 

424.71 426.43 A: [laughter] 

426.76 429.87 A: uh-huh but i've had my kids 

429.89 430.87 B: right 

430.26 436.87 A: design better designs that i saw in those newspapers what they were doing 

436.81 448.13 A: it was also for for for a business kind of aspect they were looking to to put more businesses within there which goes back to the money and his whole ideas 

440.12 441.59 B: yeah yeah of course 

447.38 452.19 B: yeah but still it's still it's just ridiculous it's wasting a lot of time and energy 

451.91 456.97 A: no i don't know i don't know anymore how do you travel to uh work do you 

456.21 459.08 B: m._t._a. gets you there at two dollars now 

458.84 463.78 A: at two so what do you think about the uh fare thing that they've 

462.83 473.00 B: well i want to see what's gonna happen with the court case 'cause if it's if it stays and it's not changed if the ruling doesn't change we'll be back to a dollar fifty 

469.60 470.49 A: (( uh-huh )) 

472.64 473.96 A: (( right )) 

473.03 474.78 B: on may twenty eighth 

474.35 476.39 A: is that what they're saying i didn't 

475.52 485.86 B: that's what they had said now but you know how it is they're gonna appeal it they're gonna fight it but technically m._t._a. lied because they screwed up some jobs got screwed up 

477.16 478.11 A: (( [cough] )) 

486.05 493.85 B: the bids were wrong it was tied in to people who knew people and it was nothing but a mess so here we go again we're paying for it 

489.50 490.48 A: mhm 

490.79 491.88 A: mhm 

492.87 503.59 A: and we're picking up the slack like we're doing for this war like we're doing i tell you i made less years ago and i lived better and i had peace of mind 

499.87 500.89 B: yeah 

503.20 505.64 B: yeah well it was different years ago 

505.45 507.96 A: well what made it just so different 

507.23 508.92 B: economy was better 

509.48 513.77 B: first of all it was every a lot of people more people a lot more people were working 

513.52 517.34 A: oh up up till recently we right 

515.03 521.49 B: up until recently up until last year they reformed the welfare laws so made people go work for that little bit of money 

521.37 524.42 A: and that knocks out the ones that yeah 

523.00 532.39 B: right it knocks home and do not i mean there was some changes that were good you know and now it's just like you know the city's like strapped again for money 

526.79 527.95 A: (( all right )) 

532.12 537.07 A: it's horrible i see people young people at work that have come in 

533.12 533.99 B: (( yeah )) 

537.19 540.04 A: owing so much money for tuition 

539.54 540.56 B: yeah 

540.21 544.38 A: and they're being given pink slips and stuff 

543.35 546.45 B: yeah you don't know if you're gonna have a job at the end of the week 

545.92 558.88 A: i myself i'm looking into the hospitals to all the health services every every system that we had in the city it's unbelievable what's going on 

557.01 558.05 B: (( i know i know )) 

558.98 569.86 A: i i'm i'm looking i say maybe i had a a college education when i was going to public school when i see what's going on in the systems that we have now

567.66 568.44 B: yeah 

569.21 570.29 B: that's true

580.66 584.80 A: and then i look to the paper to give me reassurance 

580.71 581.57 B: (( yeah )) 

584.14 586.55 B: there ain't no reassurance in the newspapers 

585.26 586.52 A: (( and there is ))
