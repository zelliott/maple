492.23 493.99 B: i'm too tired to do it 

495.26 499.52 A: oh so you just set up so that you call in when you have time instead 

498.90 511.88 B: yeah they called me a couple of times but i was so busy or i was not home when they called so i i think the first one they actually called me and the other ones i just called called on my own because every time they call i'm always busy and i can't get to the phone 

512.25 513.13 A: (( of )) 

513.43 518.06 B: yeah i thought the time i i thought the time i set up was a good time but it wasn't [laughter]

518.07 521.01 A: [laughter] well you finally did it huh 

520.66 523.10 B: yeah exactly finally got it done [laughter] 

523.07 526.63 A: yeah well it's worthwhile even though it's ah 

526.71 528.77 A: complicated to get 

529.01 530.81 A: get the timing in there 

530.43 532.93 B: exactly but it's worth it [laughter] 

533.43 536.40 A: what what are the subjects that you had to deal 

536.12 539.04 B: ah i think the last one was on sports 

539.38 540.01 A: (( with )) 

539.48 544.46 B: i didn't really know about i didn't really have much to talk about that one and the third was about censorship 

546.90 549.90 A: ah interesting set of topics they come up with 

549.62 555.07 B: yeah exactly but they just want i guess i guess they're looking at people how they talk and stuff i don't know [laughter] 

555.26 557.87 A: yeah i i don't know i guess i 

558.18 561.46 A: i really didn't understand their goal but that's okay 

561.17 564.33 B: uh-huh yeah exactly [laughter] yeah 

564.09 566.94 A: just sit and try and talk for ten minutes huh 

566.34 569.56 B: exactly think of things to talk about [laughter] 

568.94 570.00 A: [laughter] 

570.71 572.81 A: yeah sometimes it's tough to do 

572.72 574.60 B: uh-huh [laughter] 

578.23 581.23 A: like now [laughter] 

579.23 582.82 B: exactly yeah it's like what else can we talk about news [laughter] 

582.99 588.61 B: because like some of the topics it's like i'm not really into the news and stuff like that i'd rather not know what's going on 

589.44 591.96 A: yeah that's probably true too it's 

591.20 594.79 B: uh-huh it's with everything going on right now it's like i'd rather not know 

595.11 596.38 B: because then you don't get to 

595.20 598.64 A: ah oh yeah you get to hear all about the bombers and ah 

598.28 599.89 B: (( mhm and like i said if you don't ))
