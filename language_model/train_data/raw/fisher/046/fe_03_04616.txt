416.68 418.14 B: oh okay 

417.72 426.01 A: so and it's you know it's the recording at first and then you know i think i think the first time they called one of them was like affirmative action or something like that 

425.48 426.80 B: oh okay 

426.57 431.14 A: and i was like well [laughter] that's pretty [laughter] that's pretty indepth i think 

430.50 434.56 B: [noise] well they good a budg- i mean they must have a endless amount of topics because um 

434.47 447.06 B: [noise] i guess it's every day there's a new topic i don't how long this s- i don't know how long this study is going on for but i mean [noise] it must have a lot of different topics that to ah [mn] to ta- that people talk about 

440.18 441.12 A: huh 

444.01 445.14 A: right 

446.47 448.06 A: yeah that's for sure 

447.91 454.29 B: and i think it's interesting how they have this money to i mean they gotta have tons of i mean ah that must have been some huge grant that they got 

448.35 449.09 A: (( yeah )) 

454.39 455.11 B: to

460.94 461.50 B: (( [mn] )) 

461.64 476.45 B: yeah and you get you get i guess you get a maximum of three discussions so and i guess three or four weeks after your last discussion that you have you get you get like you know for the three calls you get thirty bucks for for ten minutes a deal so that's pretty cool 

472.61 473.66 A: right 

473.71 474.68 A: well 

475.86 483.78 A: yeah that is real cool and well see we've got ah we've got a company down here that's actually in downtown nashville that's called twenty twenty
