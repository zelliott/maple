271.75 272.47 A: huh

455.24 456.92 A: yeah they do if you like 

457.12 458.22 A: some particular 

458.42 460.31 A: well that's true on the internet 

459.30 461.52 B: lot of interaction 

461.52 465.93 A: oh yeah i guess you've got to get some game and then yeah then they have 'em linked together 

465.39 468.17 B: [noise] it just doesn't interest me in the least 

466.81 473.94 A: i don't know so that kinda sounds kinda scary to me that you're playing something you don't know [laughter] but i guess it's like playing against the computer 

471.32 472.54 B: yeah 

473.39 477.18 B: or maybe it would be exciting i don't know to like never 

475.02 481.66 A: [laughter] more challenging [mn] yeah hm 

477.31 480.13 B: know who they are yeah and don't know their 

480.37 483.24 B: level of competency [noise] but 

483.35 488.59 B: i know my husband got pretty hooked on solitaire for about a year [mn] 

488.55 491.02 A: yeah that comes with the computer i think 

490.75 492.12 B: (( oh yeah )) 

491.37 494.39 A: there's that little group of games you get that the typical 

493.89 497.31 B: oh really i haven't even looked i probably have that 

495.10 496.64 A: yeah oh yeah 

497.06 506.15 A: yeah i think any windows they give you there's five basic games or something pinball and you just look under your programs yeah 

500.19 502.32 B: mhm i didn't know that 

506.38 506.94 A: (( [mn] )) 

506.57 509.21 B: and so what's the one called that you like 

509.06 512.10 A: i well i've got like a c._d. just just like porsche 

511.89 517.18 A: auto driving you know where you drive a car it's pretty realistic it's three d. and 

511.97 513.30 B: okay 

517.04 523.17 A: it's it's kinda funny i don't have a good steering wheel or anything so i'm just banging on the keyboard so i can't really steer it's 

521.13 522.42 B: oh yeah 

523.16 532.24 A: you push one key and you go one way and one key goes the other and the car just lunges back and forth but it's really funny because it'll play back 

532.01 540.45 A: what you did and it'll do like the whole movie of you driving the race and it's got your name on the licence plate so it's 

538.50 540.19 B: (( oh really )) 

540.24 547.83 A: it's hilarious because you know i wasn't doing too good driving with a keyboard so you see the car swerving back and forth and [laughter] 

547.19 547.93 B: oh 

548.22 550.42 A: (( so yeah i think it'd be entertaining )) 

548.24 553.93 B: [laughter] it's probably like any little movement is a big swerve i would say 

552.79 562.09 A: well you wouldn't have a keyboard yeah it's like you're jerking the steering wheel over and the car the car is pretty good because it acts like it leans over when it suddenly turns 

554.60 555.88 B: yeah 

556.72 558.23 B: yeah 

560.74 561.78 B: (( oh )) 

561.82 563.23 B: sounds pretty fun 

562.86 572.35 A: oh yeah yeah it's very realistic i haven't played it in [mn] probably quite a few weeks but sometime i want to get a steering wheel you get these little steering wheel accessories you plug in 

572.03 573.96 B: well that sounds like yeah 

572.89 575.31 A: (( probably like in arcade )) 

574.65 580.00 B: that would be good um what was when did you do your other phone call last night [noise] 

579.41 581.06 A: oh it was about a week ago 

580.60 583.02 B: yeah i didn't i haven't done one for about a week 

582.28 585.34 A: (( oh yeah she's getting after me i gotta keep doing it [laughter] this ))

593.53 594.85 B: (( oh okay )) 

594.13 599.89 A: which was pretty good because i was i said i was against any minimum wage and you know he said uh i'm
