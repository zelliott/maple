103.61 117.10 B: i mean every one's gon- you know not everyone gets along you know and i think that this marriage will make it i guess i i want to be sure that this is the one and i i think everybody wants to do that before they get married 

110.24 110.80 A: (( [mn] )) 

116.52 118.20 A: yeah right right 

117.58 119.61 B: but at the same time you never know 

119.47 131.35 B: you you never really know until you get you know until you you do the every day thing for the rest of your life on your mind type thing when you realise that this is going to be the rest of your life then you realise hey this is my wife i'm gonna you know 

119.49 120.28 A: (( yes [laughter] )) 

131.23 138.26 B: i'm gonna be with her for the rest of my life so that kind it's kind of scary because i was i was like a uh i would say like i was a playboy 

138.37 141.57 B: through college and when i got out of college i had a child 

139.41 140.32 A: uh-huh 

141.67 156.43 B: and i think that that kind of pushed me towards getting married so i i don't know and i guess maybe you you'd be able to help me a little bit more 'cause you've been through one marriage already uh what do you what do you think i should do to make sure that this is the right one 

141.69 142.66 A: okay

166.94 172.67 B: uh not the in laws it's really not it really isn't the in laws um i would say it's it's more or less 

168.37 169.21 A: (( no )) 

170.01 170.86 A: oh 

172.72 174.69 B: uh it's more or less her 

174.68 176.09 A: oh okay 

174.81 177.84 B: um she had a she had a surgery 

177.85 182.94 B: um a couple of years ago she's a flight attendant not even a couple of years ago it was about uh nine months ago 

180.24 180.80 A: (( [mn] )) 

182.51 183.61 A: uh-huh 

183.07 186.99 B: and uh she had a surgery she had uh uh her lung collapsed 

186.67 188.02 A: (( oh wow )) 

187.49 192.95 B: and uh they you know and it collapsed about four times after they got it got it up finally 

192.59 193.61 A: (( uh-huh [mn] )) 

193.22 206.05 B: and she she you know she gave me a a sort of a sob story telling me you know i i really want you know i want to be married 'cause i don't know how long i'm gonna be alive and that kind of pressured me you you understand what i'm saying 

203.28 207.91 A: [laughter] oh boy that that's a lot of pressure right 

206.60 218.99 B: that that it's scary because you know you want to do the right thing but at the time at at at the same at the same token you don't want to be you know pushed into a relationship that maybe might not be the right one 

210.89 211.86 A: yeah 

218.62 222.27 A: right and it's a- all for the wrong reasons too uh 

221.27 232.49 B: yeah it it is and and and on top of that there's a child involved and that's another reason why i'm i'm you know i'm in i'm i'm basically going in on this situation and willing to you know willing to get married 

225.43 226.44 A: (( [mn] )) 

229.01 229.81 A: uh-huh 

231.80 233.98 A: how's her medical uh condition now 

233.99 244.65 B: well right now she they they have to do the other lung because it was a it was a uh uh i guess they call it it it hereditary it was a hereditary condition she has blabs on on her lung 

242.14 243.07 A: oh 

244.41 245.33 A: [mn] 

244.88 252.28 B: and these blabs she was a flight attendant and going up and down pre- the the pressure you know increasing and decreasing made them expand 

251.68 254.23 A: yeah that makes sense sure [laughter] 

252.47 253.40 B: so 

253.64 257.51 B: so she she basically had to give up what she was doing for a career 

257.53 267.42 B: and that made her depressed which made me depressed because i'm dealing with her on a regular basis you know what i mean so it's just like and then on top of that she was in hospital on her birthday 

261.60 263.54 A: yeah all right oh sure 

267.53 268.34 B: (( and [mn] )) 

268.59 275.33 B: right now we we have no idea she has c._a._t. scans you know every every week or so so i mean 

272.64 273.20 A: (( [mn] )) 

274.55 276.11 A: jesus it's a 

275.40 280.73 B: it it's it's it's really [mn] you know it's a it's a it's a pretty scary situation but at the same time 

278.73 281.63 A: is the prognosis pretty good for the future 

281.55 282.55 B: i'm sorry 

282.11 285.28 A: is the prognosis pretty good do you think she'll be okay in the future 

284.84 288.97 B: well they're saying that she's going to have to get another she's going to have get another surgery done 

288.71 289.71 A: uh-huh 

289.40 292.96 B: to uh to basically like scrape those blabs 

292.74 293.61 B: and then 

293.50 307.94 B: and then sew it back up like they take a piece of her lung out when they do that so we really don't know the doctor's saying she could go the rest of her life without having the surgery but there's a possibility a great possibility since she had one already she's going to have to have the other one done 

297.21 298.36 A: uh-huh 

307.93 308.99 A: wow 

308.70 311.39 B: so that that makes it pretty scary but i mean 

310.34 314.27 A: well maybe being maybe having a different occupation will help though too [mn] 

313.77 320.60 B: yeah yeah definitely i mean it's less stressful you know she's not in the air every day and and she got laid off on nine eleven 

320.51 321.68 A: oh 

321.40 323.59 B: 'cause she was working for u. s. airways 

323.02 324.04 A: uh-huh 

323.81 332.04 B: so you know that was kind of good but they asked her to go back and and the doctor said she can't go back because she can't even go in the water right now like going to a pool 

327.67 328.23 A: (( [mn] )) 

331.75 333.07 A: (( yeah )) 

332.51 334.91 B: until until you know she gets back 

333.79 340.81 A: 'cause there's different different pressure on her lungs right wow there's different pressure on her lungs in a pool or in the air 

337.05 338.04 B: i'm sorry 

340.25 354.64 B: oh yeah pressure [mn] and anywhere she any- anything she does air or in the water she can't do either one of 'em for a while until she gets her health back fully so she's doing health tests but basically [mn] you know i'm i'm concerned about you know 

348.11 349.43 A: (( oh )) 

354.86 358.48 B: th- this was a great topic for them to [laughter] to give me tonight 

357.60 359.80 A: [laughter] yeah really 

358.53 364.78 B: that the simple fact that i i don't know what to do and it's la- it's it's larry right 

362.12 363.47 A: are you live are 

364.18 365.40 A: right correct 

364.83 369.03 B: okay larry i'm sorry but i i you know i really don't know what to do i mean i 

368.25 370.12 A: are you living together 

369.73 373.49 B: yeah we are currently i and and and i was pushed into that too 

370.79 371.78 A: okay 

373.45 374.31 A: (( mm )) 

373.74 384.04 B: because you know she had a child she she didn't have nowhere to live so i bought a house you know and i figure look 'cause i didn't have a father and i didn't have somewhere there with my mother when i was younger 

378.27 379.18 A: uh-huh 

384.08 392.23 B: so it makes it even more important for me to be there on a regular basis and be there with her and be with my child and be with you know 

389.30 390.03 A: yeah 

391.10 394.55 A: well how long how long have you been living together so far [cough] 

394.01 396.23 B: uh three years 

396.38 397.49 A: for a year 

397.14 398.93 B: yea- thr- three years 

398.30 399.58 A: oh three years 

399.16 403.86 B: yeah so that made the pressure even more to get married because of the three years we've been together 

401.98 407.69 A: yeah well rea- really it's just like being married anyway there isn't much difference i would think 

406.46 417.67 B: yeah that that's what i was thinking i i was thinking that you know since we're together already it wouldn't make a difference if we got married or not but everybody tells me that once they got married things did change 

408.56 409.12 A: (( [cough] )) 

417.06 418.88 A: [laughter] i 

417.87 420.77 B: a lot of things change and that's what scares me 

420.25 428.49 A: heard a couple of people say that yeah that the girl got her security then and she does change it depends on the individual though it's really hard to tell 

428.62 429.52 B: okay 

428.71 429.27 A: (( [mn] )) 

429.49 430.54 A: (( uh )) 

430.55 433.08 A: you you don't know until you try it to be honest about it 

433.15 437.85 B: and [mn] let me let me tell let me say this to you larry i now let me ask you a question 

437.10 438.44 A: (( [cough] okay )) 

438.61 446.61 B: what when your first wife no just your second wife say your second wife when you got her an engagement ring what size ring did you get her if you don't mind me asking 

442.14 443.05 A: second 

446.01 449.00 A: uh no we we were living together for a while 

449.50 453.06 A: [cough] 'scuse me and i came into some money so i got her a pretty decent one 

452.97 454.76 B: okay okay 

453.86 457.62 A: i i spent over [mn] about fifteen thousand i think 

457.04 465.76 B: okay all right yeah see because she wanted she wanted a she wanted a carat and a half and i got her a carat and then there was this argument about that and i 

464.79 466.33 A: (( oh really oh [mn] )) 

465.58 475.37 B: yeah i said i said you know i said you know what i said most people are just happy to have somebody in their lives that's willing to you know spend the rest of their lives with them you know what i mean 

471.39 472.38 A: right 

474.92 484.98 A: you know it's funny though steve my wife is like that too about diamonds it really turns her on me it doesn't even bother i i wear a plain ring i i don't want no diamond or i'm not that

486.98 487.93 A: uh-huh 

487.68 501.28 B: and you know it really it it kind of bothered me because i said to myself you know i'm putting out and and on top of the fact that i had to pay for the ring the ring only cost me about six grand it's a princess cut very very clear diamond

508.80 511.03 A: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

515.16 527.53 B: and i just don't want to be the person that if i'm not gonna make her happy if that's gonna be an issue i really don't want to have to continue in this relationship and i really don't know whether to sever it or to stay i'm really in a a bind 

522.66 523.69 A: yeah 

526.96 538.28 A: yeah that's sort of a bad sign but maybe it's only that one one item like my wife's the same way she don't care that much about spending a fortune on clothes or a car just diamonds diamonds turn 'em on for some reason i don't know why
