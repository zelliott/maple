32.08 34.08 B: i did hear that i'm judy 

34.06 34.86 A: okay 

34.95 39.60 B: and i guess we're supposed to talk about what is important in a life partner 

40.78 41.87 A: well 

42.00 45.54 A: i think a a life partner i mean that should be someone 

45.67 51.00 A: like you know that you trust definitely trust and 

48.96 50.22 B: trust is big 

51.32 53.48 A: and you know communication 

53.33 54.56 B: mhm 

54.36 59.09 A: one that can communicate effectively without like holding in their feelings 

59.55 61.67 A: i don't know what do you think 

61.32 65.00 B: well i think those are both very important things i think 

65.18 76.57 B: one thing that's really important are both common interests i think that it's really important to be able to do things together but i think there should also be some interests that you don't share 

76.50 80.51 B: it gives you something to go outside and be able to 

76.99 77.82 A: right 

80.83 82.94 B: to do things so that [lipsmack] 

83.39 86.30 B: you don't feel like you're being suffocated all the time 

86.38 88.49 A: definitely definitely yeah 

86.46 87.40 B: (( you know )) 

87.92 92.67 B: nothing worse than having somebody who won't do anything unless you go with them 

93.10 102.67 A: yeah that's that's being too attached you know that's that's like forced life partner and that's that's definitely not that's not natural you know 

95.30 97.06 B: yeah [laughter] 

102.29 110.18 B: yeah i don't like that at all so i think that's really important and i think probably a shared outlook on religion is good um 

110.67 114.98 B: you know if it's important to you i think that's that's great or if it's not 

114.99 120.51 B: i just think that there's probably an issue if somebody's very religious and the other person doesn't care 

120.72 122.75 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

120.82 124.21 B: unless they're open minded enough to let that go 

124.82 126.04 A: yeah it's very 

126.37 128.59 A: (( uh like i'm in a relationship )) 

129.01 132.52 A: right now and we've been together for like two and a half years 

131.87 132.86 B: uh-huh 

132.84 134.72 A: and i'm only i'm only like 

134.93 137.07 A: almost nineteen but um 

136.03 136.89 B: (( mhm )) 

137.14 145.85 A: like i think that this is like my life partner and like we like what you're saying like that we have some like some big common interests 

139.78 140.69 B: uh-huh 

145.34 146.38 B: mhm 

145.92 154.36 A: and then there's some things like i uh i'm very physically active and she's not and like so like there's a lotta things that i like to do like show her you know like 

155.15 158.73 A: like what to do to workout or like we can go out and do you know 

158.86 162.38 A: just stuff like that and then she has stuff like she's very musical 

162.21 163.21 B: mhm 

163.32 166.97 A: but i i can relate to what you're talking about as well 

165.71 172.45 B: now do you think that'll be a problem like later in your life if if she is not physically active and you continue to be 

172.79 174.31 A: um well 

176.16 176.79 A: (( yeah )) 

177.00 178.98 A: uh i'm in the military 

178.63 179.78 B: mhm 

179.51 180.82 A: and uh 

180.95 183.09 A: so it's like my physical 

183.41 186.65 A: activity level deals a lot with like military training 

186.25 187.24 B: uh-huh 

186.69 193.75 A: so like i haven't had to deal with like like what you're talking about yet but later in life i think that might be might be a 

194.83 199.02 B: see i have i have a really good friend and he loves to ski 

195.17 195.85 A: (( problem )) 

199.18 204.81 B: he skis all the time that he can and his wife hates it 

205.69 208.03 A: does it like time away from them or 

205.83 206.73 B: and 

207.73 211.51 B: well she just doesn't like it i mean she's not a skier she's very 

212.08 217.82 B: you know she's like your girlfriend like you were saying she's not just active she doesn't like to do things like that 

217.16 217.85 A: yeah 

217.99 219.04 A: right 

218.00 219.06 B: um 

219.40 225.19 B: and he has a problem because when he wants to go on vacation he wants to go someplace where they can ski 

225.60 229.10 B: and she doesn't even like the mountains and stuff like that 

229.51 231.51 A: (( yeah right )) 

234.21 236.64 B: yeah i think that's a problem for them 

236.79 237.77 B: um 

238.83 242.91 B: you know because of course you know you wanna go on vacation together and have a good time 

243.06 246.99 B: and but maybe he's a little too focused on that you know [laughter] 

247.27 250.34 A: right but i mean a life partner though like 

250.37 254.25 A: i mean yeah the person has to be giving a little bit you know 

254.15 255.14 B: mhm 

254.43 261.48 A: and so he he might have to give up a little bit of ski time and she might have to like try to go out there a little bit more 

261.11 265.42 B: yeah because he wouldn't even mind if she just went to the you know to the resort 

265.60 268.31 B: and you know just hang hung out there 

268.40 269.72 A: right 

269.05 277.24 B: but um yeah he needs to give up on that a little bit too and say you know i'm willing to go the beach and just you know lay 'round and work on my tan but 

276.52 277.83 A: (( yeah right [laughter] )) 

277.36 288.70 B: [laughter] but and then that comes to trust too you know can you trust your partner if you if if you wanted to go skiing and she wanted to go to the beach could you trust each other enough on a 

278.16 279.01 A: right 

288.84 291.10 B: on a separate vacation maybe 

291.45 295.36 A: yeah that's that's definitely a big like i have a problem 

296.15 301.45 A: dealing with that 'cause i go to school at the university of texas and she's at overland college in ohio 

301.02 301.85 B: uh-huh 

302.20 309.92 A: so i mean that's like i mean that's i kinda deal with that on a daily basis you know because there's lots of girls here and lots of guys there 

309.81 312.90 B: now that's that's very interesting how do you deal with that 

313.75 316.57 A: (( well uh most times like can )) 

321.56 322.24 A: (( you )) 

324.36 326.33 B: i've kinda lost you alex 

326.61 327.75 A: (( hear me right now )) 

327.70 329.71 B: uh for a second i heard you 

330.13 331.17 A: (( can you hear me now )) 

330.83 331.81 B: there you go 

333.00 334.62 A: (( let me know if it happens )) 

334.60 335.83 B: okay i will 

335.97 336.83 A: um 

337.84 341.86 A: so yeah talking a lot on the cell phone that's pretty much what we do 

342.25 347.32 A: just letting each other know what's going on in our lives because we have unlimited sprint to sprint minutes 

346.72 347.78 B: (( mhm right )) 

351.91 353.87 B: so do you think it's important 

353.96 357.45 B: to like wanna have children together and things like that 

357.89 358.76 A: (( uh )) 

359.69 360.84 A: i 

362.38 363.17 A: (( do i )) 

363.88 365.57 A: (( do think it's important )) 

366.04 371.59 A: decision to be with someone like fully because like maybe one person isn't ready at that time 

370.91 371.91 B: mhm 

371.60 374.81 A: and later on like you know they would be 

375.49 378.00 A: (( yeah can can you see what i'm saying )) 

377.55 386.46 B: yeah i do completely but i mean well that's kind of the question that i had was do you think it's important to know that you either want to eventually or you don't want to 

386.65 388.94 B: (( i wonder what would happen like if say )) 

389.21 391.92 B: one person didn't wanna have kids 

392.90 393.46 A: (( [mn] )) 

393.33 401.46 B: well both people said they didn't wanna have kids and then like five years into the marriage somebody decided they wanted to and the other one still didn't want to 

402.83 403.80 B: (( you know )) 

403.10 407.04 A: well the other one would definitely have to like 

407.30 419.29 A: you know really about it and make sure that they're that they're like they have their feet down that they don't wanna have kids i mean because i mean that's a pretty strong that's a strong feeling you know 

418.68 428.70 B: oh and that's huge i mean you have you know if you have a child you can't just say oh i didn't like it i'm taking it to the pound you know [laughter] it didn't work out for me 

425.13 427.47 A: [laughter] yeah exactly 

428.49 429.60 A: yeah 

429.74 433.24 B: you know even if you get divorced that's always there mhm 

430.69 431.54 A: yeah 

433.02 434.32 A: (( exactly )) 

434.56 435.85 A: (( so i guess )) 

436.70 438.62 A: (( i guess it is important to )) 

439.73 443.01 A: to know the answer to that question before getting into a 

443.31 446.48 A: like being with someone for the rest of your life you know 

446.80 448.17 A: like you know to 

448.18 451.77 A: find out you know if they'd wanna have kids 

451.79 463.79 A: and you know if you're both no then you know that can always change but if one's yes and one's no then you know they should seriously talk about you know if they wanna be like lifetime partners make sure that's the right decision 

464.21 465.34 B: yeah 

466.11 467.73 B: that would be hard i think 

468.13 469.03 A: (( yeah that would )) 

471.14 472.10 A: (( definitely be )) 

473.00 474.36 A: (( hard how old are you )) 

474.36 476.22 B: i'm i'm losing you again 

476.47 477.77 A: (( can you hear me )) 

478.17 480.59 B: you i hear like every other word 

482.75 483.46 B: no 

484.43 485.14 A: (( now )) 

485.08 486.12 B: (( no )) 

487.51 488.30 A: how 

488.11 489.15 B: there you go 

489.54 491.65 B: [laughter] 

491.84 494.22 A: (( about now now okay i was )) 

495.78 500.52 A: just wondering if you've ever been encountered with like a situation like that 

499.75 500.67 B: um 

500.71 508.32 B: not myself i have kids and i wanted to have kids and my husband wanted to have kids so that was fine but um 

508.40 509.47 A: right 

508.97 519.10 B: i have a friend the reason i asked is because it's funny i seem to have more men friends than women friends now that i think about it but i have this friend who was married 

519.37 534.29 B: and they had both decided that they wanted to have kids somewhere down the line and i guess about five years or so into the marriage she decided she did not wanna have kids but she didn't talk to him about it she went out and had her tubes tied 

534.10 535.85 A: (( uh-huh oh )) 

534.66 535.76 B: and then 

536.17 542.03 B: and he was in the military he was gone and um when he came back she says well guess what 

542.76 546.63 B: i don't wanna have kids [laughter] and here's what i did about it um 

546.93 547.64 A: (( okay )) 

546.98 551.51 B: and and that just really ruined their whole marriage i mean he just couldn't accept that 

551.69 554.63 A: yeah that's that's that whole communication 

554.55 558.11 B: e- you know that's exactly what it is it's not so much 

558.31 562.89 B: wanting to have the kids or not wanting to have the kids it's the fact that she did something that big 

563.07 565.49 A: you've just got to talk about it i mean that's 

565.21 566.42 B: yeah 

567.45 571.51 B: yeah exactly so i agree with you communication is key 

572.69 576.76 B: you just have to have that or else there's just nothing nothing else 

576.48 577.71 A: right 

577.14 579.72 B: or else you're just two people that live in the same house 

580.81 583.30 A: (( exactly how )) 

584.37 585.32 B: i'm sorry 

585.56 588.41 A: long have you been with your have you been married 

587.85 592.67 B: oh [laughter] you're gonna laugh longer than you've been alive dear

595.24 597.85 B: i have been married for thirty one years 

598.17 599.89 A: (( that's that's awesome congratulations ))
