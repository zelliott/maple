38.19 40.36 B: um let's see 

40.54 43.21 B: quite a few things i guess um 

42.32 43.62 A: yeah 

43.31 48.63 B: i'd like someone who is of course kind and considerate someone who 

48.96 51.65 B: uh makes me feel like the only person in the world 

51.64 52.70 A: mhm 

51.81 64.55 B: um [lipsmack] someone who i can trust definitely the most important probably i would say is is trust someone who makes me feel secure in our relationship and um 

63.13 64.07 A: uh-huh 

64.83 71.34 B: definitely very very very high on the list is someone who never takes me for granted um 

69.97 71.18 A: (( all right )) 

71.62 74.98 B: [lipsmack] and let's see as far as 

75.43 81.69 B: personality traits et cetera um the most important would probably be sense of humor 

82.23 86.59 B: um i want someone to make me laugh and um 

86.79 88.59 B: someone who 

88.67 99.99 B: i don't want to shallow and say looks but i have to be attracted to the person um they don't have to be a super model [laughter] or anything like that but i would like uh to at least 

92.74 94.38 A: mhm mhm 

95.99 97.23 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

100.02 106.35 B: uh find them attractive and um [lipsmack] let's see someone who 

101.48 102.44 A: uh-huh 

106.77 117.78 B: has a good family i guess um i want someone who not so much that they have a good family um just someone who gets along with their family because i have a big family and um 

109.18 110.25 A: mhm 

117.90 120.98 B: i'm close to my family so i feel like if i if 

121.45 127.42 B: the guy is let's say close to his family um that we may get along better you know 

123.72 124.73 A: uh-huh 

127.00 128.98 A: yep i would think so 

127.95 129.75 B: similarities i guess 

129.22 131.14 A: yeah yep 

130.87 132.95 B: um how about yourself 

132.59 137.02 A: uh-huh uh well and i must are you still looking for this person 

136.73 139.37 B: yeah [laughter] 

137.65 150.59 A: [laughter] yeah [laughter] i thought the way you were talking you were married first i thought now am i gonna ask her like what she's done if this is you know if she's found this person and then as it went on i thought i don't think she's found him yet [laughter] 

141.09 142.34 B: (( it's so hard )) 

149.69 152.22 B: no not at all not yet [laughter] 

150.62 157.22 A: but but that's okay i do believe yeah definitely like if you're close with your family you wanna find somebody because 

157.14 168.98 A: that's that is close with his 'cause they'll put the importance on that otherwise you can get people that are envious or jealous or you know and they don't want you to spend time with your family and oh my that would be awful so 

160.30 161.64 B: mhm 

163.43 164.96 B: exactly 

166.35 167.59 B: mhm 

169.01 176.31 A: but um yeah i well i am married and i i've been married um for eighteen years now so 

175.38 176.75 B: oh wow 

176.37 187.91 A: and uh i i guess i you know it's just a lotta things that you mentioned uh you know somebody that's responsible and reliable dependable 

185.56 186.66 B: mhm 

187.95 196.71 A: um and trust i mean i don't even know how you could even have a relationship if you don't trust somebody i guess that's really high 

193.87 194.96 B: mhm 

196.75 197.82 A: um 

198.35 207.78 A: [lipsmack] but um i don't know there is compromise involved [laughter] i think everybody i think we have a lotta the same 

202.39 203.68 B: [laughter] 

207.88 210.28 A: goals and um 

210.55 225.37 A: uh desires for our life and for our family we have five children and yeah and we yeah we have a lot of of that going you know so i think that was probably a lot of the attractiveness of it when we first met 

213.86 214.78 B: mhm 

215.08 216.02 B: oh 

216.06 217.22 B: that's awesome 

223.59 224.70 B: mhm 

225.45 226.72 A: and um 

227.01 233.84 A: but i do think any re- i don't know i i was going to say any relationship but i'm not sure about that but in ours i know 

233.85 238.70 A: there is there is compromising you know that you have i think you have to do 

238.74 246.01 B: i think that compromise is definitely important but i think that in a lotta relationships things kinda 

246.38 256.90 B: go wrong when one person is expected to compromise everything and the other person is just kinda like nope this is my way this is what i get 'cause i know i had a relationship like that in the past 

249.94 252.58 A: (( and mhm mhm mhm )) 

255.50 256.54 A: mhm 

256.84 265.24 B: where i'm like but you're not seeing my side can you please just try to see it from my side too and nope this is the way i i think it is so this is the way that's right 

264.27 278.28 A: yeah and that like isn't too much of a compromise [laughter] it's only on the one person but you know there- therefore you're not both compromising but i think you you you probably have to do that in most relationships because 

265.26 266.17 B: so 

268.12 270.00 B: (( exact- [laughter] )) 

272.09 273.73 B: exactly if 

277.07 278.10 B: (( mhm )) 

278.25 287.51 A: it is hard probably to find somebody that is ideal but i don't know now now too i just think i also feel 

288.87 297.54 A: oh i can't believe i don't think either one of us mentioned this either but see i'm almost fifty years old now so 

297.59 302.31 A: um i just think i'm really getting down to the basic part of it where 

302.43 307.75 A: i feel that if you were truly truly in love with that person 

307.28 308.36 B: mhm 

307.91 312.05 A: that that is the most important thing 

312.41 327.07 A: and in and that other things will work out and and come together and you'll be happy but i i really feel that you've really got to sincerely love that person you know 

326.49 332.21 B: i can't believe like in all my calls no one's ever said that [laughter] i'm like oh my god that's so true 

331.89 335.99 A: yes you know and i just it's you know i've just like now 

335.76 341.29 A: well this is my second marriage also i mean you might've figured that out by now when i'm saying eighteen years i i 

337.58 338.59 B: mhm 

341.29 356.26 A: really should've been married longer than that i have a thirty year old daughter [laughter] so i was married once and i was divorced for nine years and then remarried and then had the four children and but that's what i think when i'm with when i'm talking to my children now 

348.22 349.52 B: mhm 

356.36 359.56 A: i think that's the part i wanna get across 

359.41 373.84 A: that you know love does seem to conquer all if you really love truly love that person a lotta these things you're gonna be able to to deal with overlook compromise and all that but boy if you don't really love somebody then 

361.98 362.81 B: (( mm )) 

373.74 388.55 A: i don't know its i don't even know if it's worth worth [laughter] getting married and trying to work at it if you don't truly love that person so i think that's something that i wanna hit them pretty strong with you know 

378.51 379.37 B: mhm 

387.75 388.73 B: mhm 

388.62 397.44 A: because we do get wrapped up in all the other things you know of course trust you know love and trust let's say that and then respect too 

391.78 393.43 B: definitely 

397.10 398.12 B: mhm 

397.49 400.94 A: you know is is really important because you have to 

401.14 405.93 A: have to really have respect for that person because then that kinda dictates 

406.06 413.47 A: you know how you're gonna how you're gonna treat him and how you're gonna look at him and and that so i think those are all very very important qualities 

413.05 414.25 B: [laughter] 

413.73 415.68 A: [laughter] yeah so 

414.84 416.24 B: definitely 

415.95 417.04 A: yeah 

417.76 429.53 A: but it's tough and then you know and they can just make or ya or break ya i mean it's like its well an important decision in your life you know because just make it be such an asset to you 

425.66 427.16 B: (( yeah )) 

429.51 433.85 A: or else it can just you know make it so difficult so 

434.17 440.99 A: and it's it's just amazing like i haven't witnessed this myself but you know how do people 

441.02 445.18 A: go from like you hear the stories and stuff how do people go from 

445.20 453.49 A: feeling like they are in love and getting married and then to some of these well even that man that killed his expectant wife 

452.34 454.28 B: oh yeah 

453.57 468.33 A: i mean how how does that happen you know that you can go from you know what a marriage is supposed to be to actually apparently i don't know if he hated her so bad well we don't even know if he's totally guilty but you know what i mean 

467.94 469.27 B: yeah yeah 

468.31 474.21 A: how can those extremes occur you know in in relationships it's just 

474.93 488.21 B: [sigh] i mean i just like i guess the the relation- the strong relationship that i have in my life will be like my parents their marriage i mean [lipsmack] they've been married now for twenty going to be twenty nine years 

475.32 476.31 A: pretty 

483.91 485.02 A: mhm 

487.65 488.64 A: uh-huh 

488.57 492.22 B: and any time i meet someone you know 

492.22 499.97 B: i guess that's their marriage is the standard i'm always gonna hold my relationships up to 'cause i guess i'm essentially just 

496.04 497.09 A: uh-huh 

497.17 498.34 A: uh-huh 

499.93 507.24 B: looking for a marriage as strong as theirs and you know you hear some of these stories and i try to imagine like my parents ever like [lipsmack] 

507.54 510.72 B: turning on each other and i'm just like it's so 

508.62 509.58 A: yeah 

511.27 514.77 B: out there and unfathomable it's it's just it's just 

513.19 514.16 A: mhm 

515.12 516.82 B: crazy and i 

515.77 517.96 A: would never happen yeah 

517.09 522.86 B: exactly so i see these other people and i'm like [mn] what went wrong [laughter] 

518.39 519.91 A: yeah and you know 

522.06 526.57 A: yeah yeah oh that is so wonderful that you have that to 

526.95 531.12 A: to look up i mean and i think that'll be a great asset when you're 

528.16 529.42 B: (( yeah )) 

531.21 539.09 A: when when you are you know considering i mean that's that's won- what a wonderful example now do you have brothers and sisters also

547.60 548.24 A: (( uh-huh )) 

554.82 557.69 A: oh [laughter]

583.73 585.23 A: mhm 

584.20 586.56 B: is is when you find it
