246.20 248.66 A: uh you could do i guess 

249.33 253.08 A: line dancing doesn't have a lot of back turning does it 

252.53 255.12 B: i refuse to [laughter] 

253.83 258.45 A: [laughter] i'm just i've never never seen what the uh the big

279.60 280.84 A: wow 

279.91 285.38 B: now well you you say wow but this is a woman who couldn't stay awake past nine 

285.20 296.65 B: [laughter] the rest of her life and of a sudden it's like oh well i didn't get home until three in the morning i was dancing again and [laughter] you know it'll be like again tomorrow so don't call me before noon and she's

299.13 308.98 B: [lipsmack] she sent me a link to a friend of hers website where there were pictures and videos from their wedding it's really nicely done 

307.08 308.48 A: mhm 

309.02 309.92 A: mhm

312.11 312.95 A: mhm 

317.98 318.95 A: oh 

318.26 324.63 B: and it's great they're out on this grassy slope and the girl has a beautiful dress and the guy is hefting her up on to his shoulder 

324.84 325.71 A: (( okay )) 

324.87 330.21 B: and then she leans back and her feet are up in the air and that kick is where they took the picture 

330.09 334.54 A: (( mhm )) 

330.39 339.02 B: fabulous picture then i watched the bride and groom have their first dance and i'm looking at it and thinking i don't wanna learn to dance that way [laughter] 

337.74 341.14 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

339.67 343.08 B: that don't even look like fun to me and 

343.75 354.51 B: then like my sister just got married but she didn't do her reception yet that's supposed to be in the summer and it'll be a swing dance reception i think i can't go you know i'm pretty sure i have something that night 

347.68 349.67 A: (( yeah )) 

351.06 352.32 A: (( oh )) 

352.48 359.93 A: yeah oh my god yeah so she just she just had the civil ceremony 

355.44 356.62 B: but 

359.55 366.01 B: yep yep because um there were immigration issues so she hurried up and got married 

360.60 361.57 A: (( oh okay )) 

363.30 364.27 A: oh 

365.94 366.77 A: (( oh )) 

366.08 369.24 B: and that's fine that's fine 

367.88 378.94 A: yeah that's cool well i i've always maintained that when i actually do get married i'll probably just have a civil ceremony and then on our first anniversary i'll have the the big deal 

373.04 373.84 B: mhm 

379.17 389.12 B: that probably is a much more sane way of doing it you know just the tension of doing that party at the same time that you're making all these other life changes 

382.50 383.70 A: yeah well 

385.48 387.23 A: yeah 

388.68 389.64 A: yes 

389.29 390.30 B: (( you know )) 

390.50 401.25 B: my boyfriend vacillates you know when he first started talking about our getting married he was talking about you know something where you're inviting you know small nation states to come 

400.14 404.93 A: [laughter] see i'm so anti that 

401.90 402.87 B: and then 

403.84 417.66 B: [laughter] well and then the last thing he said was you know gee i'd like one smaller than your sister's now hold on a second my sister got married and okay her siblings were there her parents were there her nephew was there 

411.66 412.72 A: mhm 

415.75 416.77 A: mhm 

417.97 429.82 B: and the groom had one friend how do you make it any smaller i said and my boyfriend my boyfriend was there too how do you make it any smaller than that honey [laughter] you know you don't invite the justice of the peace hm hm hm 

429.14 431.37 A: [laughter] 

430.32 442.44 B: i'm not sure this gonna work you know yeah i'll tell my son he can't come to my wedding that's an excellent plan [laughter] you know there won't be any resentment whatsoever dear mhm 

432.77 434.45 A: [laughter] 

442.30 446.15 A: [laughter] that's hysterical 

444.85 455.99 B: absolutely crazy whereas i started off with the idea of you know check in check out as small as possible and i said actually if i just think of it as a party 

452.66 453.46 A: yes 

456.15 459.71 B: hey you know there are some people i'd like to have a party with 

456.30 457.18 A: (( yes )) 

459.77 468.68 A: yeah well that's what i think i'd do is like the whole first anniversary thing is like i'd like to have a small reception where it's just my family and like 

459.97 461.51 B: you know [laughter] 

468.71 474.41 A: only only really there are only like five friends in the world that i'd really want to share 

473.23 474.20 B: mhm 

474.38 475.33 B: mhm 

474.65 479.51 A: you know that sort of thing with so you know those five or six friends 

476.68 477.56 B: mhm 

479.95 491.39 A: and then just have a huge party and you know whoever you know the whole thing where you have to invite this person and you can't invite this person if you don't invite this person they can all come to the party i don't even need to talk to them 

487.31 488.97 B: mhm mhm 

489.19 496.09 B: and did this person invite you will this person invite you if they didn't invite you is it rude to invite them 

493.00 493.98 A: yeah 

496.13 500.54 B: [mn] [laughter] you know it doesn't do a thing for me 

496.14 497.14 A: yeah
