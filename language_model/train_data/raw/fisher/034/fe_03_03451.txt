26.79 28.92 B: where in wilmington did you fish 

28.46 34.16 A: um on some beach [laughter] i mean my husband could tell ya i couldn't 

30.46 32.14 B: (( [laughter] )) 

32.83 36.52 B: if you drove your car out on the beach it was at carolina beach 

35.81 39.73 A: [noise] it's carolina he just yelled at me [laughter] it's carolina 

37.76 38.69 B: yeah 

39.22 42.93 B: it yeah if you drove your car out there that's where you drove [laughter] 

41.97 43.46 A: well that's 

43.66 46.85 A: that's um where we used to go fishing 

46.28 52.07 B: yeah we used to have bonfires out there and and have cookouts with the people we hang out with 

51.50 53.08 A: oh really 

52.28 58.76 B: and about three years ago they came and told us that it was against the law to have a fire we had to put our fire out 

58.38 60.05 A: [noise] oh really 

58.96 60.58 B: but nobody 

60.69 64.64 B: the the property is privately owned on that end of the beach 

64.06 65.99 A: (( oh you're kidding [sigh] [noise] )) 

65.04 69.40 B: uh-uh and i called the fire marshal the next day and he said that 

69.47 72.21 B: the police department has no jurisdiction there 

72.10 73.23 A: oh 

72.38 76.37 B: that no one does because it's it's privately owned it's not 

75.42 77.61 A: so they had no right

79.47 80.93 A: oh lord 

80.09 84.77 B: then we circled all the s._u._v.s around it when they disappeared we started it back up [laughter] 

84.28 91.22 A: well um do they still allow that i mean riding your driving your car out there and stuff 

90.85 95.15 B: um [sigh] i think they do there's been a big 

95.92 101.49 B: there's there's been a bunch of talk about it and it's been in the news and the papers for the last couple of years because 

102.04 107.10 B: you know they've got they've run other people off that beach and they they don't have a right to do that 

106.30 107.86 A: [noise] right 

107.31 114.37 B: because people have always gone out there if anybody was gonna run you away it had to be the property owners and i don't even think they live anywhere around

120.50 127.19 A: right what is the most important thing to look for in a life partner

141.95 142.80 A: i'm 

144.22 145.31 A: right 

147.59 149.79 B: also has to be very responsible 

149.69 156.92 A: [noise] right right responsibility plays a big part and willing to um you know 

156.98 159.40 A: be fifty fifty and 

159.49 160.97 A: treat you

260.76 273.69 A: b. j. really doesn't care i mean he's older than me and he's done went through all that you know where he partied and all that and you know and i'm just now 

274.10 279.08 A: [mn] you know wanting to go to clubs and dance and stuff like that 

278.97 290.94 A: and you know he respects my wishes and just like i do his you know but now don't get me wrong we do have our little arguments and ups and downs you know but 

290.89 297.46 A: it's not all perfect and everything but for the most part we have a good relationship 

297.16 303.61 B: yeah that's th- the same way with me and my husband we he didn't used to be real interested in yard work either 

303.64 305.13 A: oh really 

304.17 309.94 B: and no and i love my yard and i have a green house i just love plants i love flowers 

309.52 312.83 A: well i just planted like 

312.87 319.30 A: fif- well uh it's been like a month and a half ago i planted like thirty 

319.47 328.15 A: gladio- gladiolas bulbs and i guess only uh six have come up no 

326.08 330.90 B: oh you're kidding [laughter] you must have buried 'em too deep or turned 'em upside down 

329.37 338.73 A: i guess well no because of my best friend she te- to- she works at a nursery and she said don't forget 

338.77 340.25 A: to turn 

340.29 342.70 A: you know the um 

343.56 347.10 A: the little stem or whatever up 

347.30 362.24 A: you know the big part goes down the little part comes up i said okay and um i planted flowers and i didn't realize i have hostas and i didn't realize it would just grow grow grow 

347.81 348.78 B: yeah 

349.52 350.48 B: right 

361.51 362.48 B: uh-huh 

362.21 369.98 A: and i have and i didn't separate it which i'm gonna do you know this weekend and put it some- somewhere else 

370.07 371.30 A: but um 

371.58 384.66 A: i didn't realize that it was gonna grow so a lot of my other plants are being shaded you know so that might be why the glads didn't come up too so 

379.69 380.71 B: right 

384.10 386.23 B: well i planted a bunch but mine are 

386.28 391.49 B: golly they're they're way up they're like probably eighteen inches tall by now 

391.38 393.56 A: oh when did you plant yours [noise] 

392.99 393.96 B: (( um )) 

394.09 395.50 B: probably 

395.59 396.91 B: about a month ago 

397.02 401.66 A: well that's when i pl- i wonder if just the hostas is uh 

401.90 403.05 A: is 

402.09 404.54 B: i put mine out in the open sun 

404.08 414.85 A: right and see i think the ho- the hostas is shading mine so that might be the reason and after i get it thinned out maybe they'll come up so i'm hoping 

414.87 421.90 B: but what i was saying my husband didn't used to be interested in yard work but he's every year it seems like he gets a little more into it 

415.06 415.97 A: so 

421.25 422.97 A: well that's cool 

421.94 423.65 B: and helps a little more 

423.81 425.41 A: well that's cool 

425.45 428.01 A: um you know like 

428.15 438.14 A: i'll i'll go with b. j. like um you know fishing and all which i enjoy fishing you know but not as much as he does you know 

437.33 439.37 B: what town did you say you were from

472.86 473.84 B: okay 

476.77 481.17 B: well you know what the weather up there that's probably why your glads haven't come up 

481.16 484.27 A: yeah because it's been raining an awful lot 

483.51 484.98 B: probably been cold oh 

484.92 489.60 A: well it's warming up and see that's why um
