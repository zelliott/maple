21.76 23.08 A: ami a. m. i. 

23.07 25.02 B: okay cool um 

25.60 28.99 B: so what do you think is the most important thing in a life partner 

29.22 31.87 A: um to me i think 

32.44 37.42 A: just being compatible with them like being able to talk to them and confide in them 

37.57 38.98 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

37.64 38.56 A: um 

38.69 42.75 A: and if you can laugh with them i think that's the best thing 'cause humor 

42.89 46.74 A: is really important to me like if i can laugh with him and he makes me happy 

47.03 47.72 A: (( then )) 

48.79 51.04 A: then i'm then i'm happy so 

51.54 54.22 B: that's fair yeah i think like um 

54.40 55.55 B: for me 

55.58 65.57 B: uh yeah definitely compatibility like how well i can get along with someone intelligence is important but it's not like the top of like i really like a sense of humor in someone 

59.97 60.91 A: yeah 

61.82 62.81 A: yeah 

65.77 66.74 A: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

66.38 68.56 B: yeah as well so 

69.56 71.70 B: are you married or no 

71.18 74.40 A: no i'm only i'm actually just eighteen 

74.11 75.57 B: oh really cool 

74.91 76.46 A: yeah 

75.99 82.71 B: yeah i'm twenty three so i'm i have no plans of getting married [laughter] any time soon [laughter] 

77.88 79.51 A: oh are you married 

81.77 83.48 A: (( uh do you have a boyfriend though )) 

83.12 84.84 B: yeah i have a boyfriend 

84.82 86.37 A: how long have y'all been together 

86.10 89.99 B: um not that long probably like five or six months 

89.75 91.50 A: okay that's cool 

90.85 94.00 B: (( yeah how 'bout you do you have a boyfriend right now )) 

91.56 92.75 A: (( are you in college )) 

93.76 98.31 A: um i did for we were on and off for like three and a half years 

95.24 96.19 B: you did 

97.77 99.48 B: oh wow 

98.79 100.02 A: yeah 

100.01 102.89 B: so you started that relationship when you were really young 

102.68 105.74 A: yeah i did but that's probably why 

105.83 107.00 B: mhm 

106.05 110.53 A: we ended it just because i'm going off to college and i think it's best if we look around 

109.93 113.77 B: yeah that's the same situation i was in when i went off to college 

113.74 114.64 A: really 

114.15 116.55 B: yeah it worked out for the best [sigh] 

117.22 121.52 B: like now looking back on it at the time it sucked you know but [sigh] 

117.39 118.51 A: it it worked 

120.28 121.28 A: yeah 

122.06 122.97 A: but 

123.50 128.46 A: 'cause i mean you're always gonna meet new people you don't wanna just stick to one person and wonder if 

127.39 128.70 B: (( yeah that's true )) 

128.49 130.09 A: worked out with someone else 

129.71 133.40 B: yeah plus in college it's hard if you're like really tied down to someone 

133.29 134.41 A: yeah 

133.96 148.25 B: yeah like it's much better like to go out and have fun and not have to worry about those things and especially since like schoolwork can be intense and stuff it's just like well in my opinion at the time it was like another thing for me to worry about that i just like you know didn't need 

141.28 142.26 A: yeah 

148.28 148.86 A: (( mm )) 

149.63 150.37 B: so 

150.43 152.75 A: [lipsmack] uh what major are you doing 

152.51 160.74 B: um [sigh] well i graduated last year and i did um bioinfomatics and computational biology 

160.66 161.49 A: (( uh-huh that's )) 

161.71 165.71 B: so yeah and now i'm in grad school for [sigh] 

165.81 169.72 B: environmental health sciences so yeah 

166.02 167.62 A: oh good luck 

169.07 176.26 A: and that's another thing i think um well looking for someone that you're compatible with is he has to have the same likes as you 

176.33 178.29 B: yeah yeah definitely 

177.10 179.31 A: they're actually interested in what you're doing 

178.97 189.97 B: yeah but i i don't think i would want a like a carbon copy of myself because i i think i would bore myself [laughter] like but uh yeah definitely 

182.64 183.92 A: (( yeah true )) 

183.96 185.28 A: yeah 

186.12 186.96 A: [laughter]

240.92 245.65 B: um well i met him like when i was over like 

245.78 246.45 B: (( our )) 

246.50 257.72 B: [mn] at my school and like just around um me in general i grew up in new jersey like once you're graduated with um college there's like always like an obligatory tour of europe where you just go out and you know 

253.19 254.66 A: (( mhm )) 

257.75 258.59 A: right 

257.96 264.43 B: with your friends and just go and see what's out there and um so i met him last summer 

264.64 270.45 B: and i was on a train from going from london up to scotland and he was 

269.81 270.41 A: (( mhm )) 

270.46 273.36 B: on the train as well so that's where i met him 

272.02 273.52 A: that's cute [laughter] 

273.62 275.85 B: and i'm going out to visit him on monday 

275.94 276.92 B: (( so [lipsmack] )) 

276.07 278.11 A: oh that's cool is that expensive though 

278.56 279.55 B: um 

279.56 282.49 B: is it expensive in scotland 

282.03 283.82 A: i mean like to go visit him 

282.88 286.85 B: to go visit him not really well i have to pay for the plane ticket 

286.74 287.70 A: (( right okay )) 

287.11 294.25 B: and from leaving from new yo- like the new york area it's not as far so i guess it doesn't cost as much um 

294.26 301.68 B: but it it's even it like if i were to buy a ticket to go to california it'd probably be more expensive than going to europe so 

299.85 302.43 A: right does he visit you also 

302.23 307.44 B: yeah he visits me he better visit me [laughter] so 

304.81 307.87 A: [laughter] that's cute do your parents know 

308.04 321.40 B: what yeah my parents know [laughter] yeah he came to visit and they met him and they liked him so [sigh] yeah i think that's an important factor but i don't think it has to be like a definite factor you know 

310.12 310.97 A: (( [laughter] )) 

318.18 319.15 A: yeah 

321.16 322.83 A: right if your parents like him 

322.48 325.50 B: but it would make it a lot better if um you know 

324.91 326.17 A: yeah 

325.51 327.16 B: the parents got along with him 

328.11 328.86 B: (( [sigh] so )) 

329.53 333.03 B: [lipsmack] is this your first like conversation with someone else or 

332.82 334.12 A: yeah it is 

333.52 336.57 B: yeah this is my second woo-hoo 

334.76 335.66 A: i've act- 

335.91 339.91 A: oh really do you like it what is this for anyway like 

336.84 337.90 B: yeah 

339.29 345.49 B: i have no clue i talked about pets yesterday so go figure [laughter] 

343.18 343.96 A: (( [laughter] )) 

346.32 358.13 B: yeah it's it's qu- quite a difference between pets and life partners [laughter] i'm probably not supposed to divulge all that i like you know [laughter] i probably like ruined the experiment but whatever [laughter] but um 

350.44 351.50 A: yeah 

356.23 358.04 A: (( oh [laughter] that's okay )) 

358.14 359.39 B: yeah so 

359.59 367.65 B: i don't know what else is important like i think like you can just tell like you click it's i think i think it's harder to like put down in words what you really are looking for some- 

366.11 367.08 A: yeah 

367.78 369.06 B: like in someone 

369.14 372.40 B: you just know it like why do you like anything you know [noise] 

371.93 383.24 A: yeah i just well i mean looks is a big i mean not a big big factor to me because i just think if he's really understanding and he can tell you 

383.34 386.47 A: what's on his mind at the right time and not hold it off 

386.81 389.20 A: (( just be able to talk to you and confide in you then )) 

389.40 391.77 B: yeah that's true 

389.79 392.34 A: i think that's that's all good 

392.17 395.74 B: yeah but obviously there has to be some kind of attraction there 

395.77 406.06 B: like as i am getting older like looks used to be more important and i used to be like oh i'd never go for someone who was like shorter than blah blah blah or you know but i think like as you 

395.80 396.74 A: yeah 

402.90 403.90 A: right 

406.26 411.52 B: well at least as i've gotten older like i realize like you know there are some things i won't compromise on 

409.43 411.04 A: (( yes yeah you )) 

411.36 412.26 A: yes 

411.90 417.61 B: like and it's not gonna be personality or like what type of guy he is so it's gonna be looks you know [sigh] 

417.19 418.33 A: (( right exactly )) 

417.86 419.01 B: (( so [sigh] )) 

419.76 426.87 B: yeah i'm usually not in relationships it's like an anomaly for me to be [laughter] in a relationship so it's [laughter] 

425.69 426.49 A: (( huh )) 

426.89 434.35 B: yeah there's some girls who are like always like jump from relationship to relationship which is fine it's just not like me 

433.62 438.62 A: yeah i don't like that that i mean they're most likely the ones to get like divorces in the long run 

438.43 440.64 B: yeah yeah 

439.56 441.62 A: you know 'cause they're so used to 

441.63 443.81 A: breaking up with 

443.92 445.98 B: yeah that's true 

446.62 453.95 B: so are you looking forward to college so are you starting next year or you finish your freshman year okay yeah [sigh] 

448.81 450.04 A: oh yeah 

450.85 451.75 A: (( fall )) 

452.69 453.53 A: yeah 

455.56 457.33 A: (( it's gonna be fun )) 

457.11 458.49 B: (( yeah it should be )) 

457.52 461.73 A: i really w- i really wanted to go to austin but i didn't get accepted so 

460.97 461.94 B: oh 

462.57 468.14 B: sure you could always like look for if you don't like it at arlington you might love it there but if you you know 

468.28 469.18 B: um 

468.42 477.53 A: yeah i know a lot of people there and i know i'm gonna have fun 'cause i can have fun anywhere i go it's just i love like the atmosphere at austin 

470.86 472.32 B: that's good 

477.51 483.85 B: that's fair enough but a lot of my friends like transferred like after a year or two years so that's always an option 

479.04 479.95 A: yeah 

483.65 490.48 A: yeah if i do really good in my basics then i'm sure i'll get into nursing school at austin but it's very competitive right now 

484.21 485.00 B: yeah 

489.73 491.23 B: yeah 

492.02 496.69 B: [sigh] yeah that's hard the first year adjusting and like doing well 

496.55 497.71 A: mhm 

497.08 507.42 B: but a lot of p- other people just as a word of advice are gonna be drinking like excessively excessively so as long as you know like when you can party and when you know you can't 

507.24 516.86 B: you'll do really well in your classes and like where other people party all the time don't do that well the first semester and that really can differentiate people from you know each other 

507.39 508.27 A: right 

516.45 517.91 A: (( exactly how )) 

517.67 518.51 B: (( so )) 

518.77 520.33 B: yeah 

519.20 520.83 A: (( late do you have to do this till ))
