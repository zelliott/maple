348.47 356.39 A: um if i did that then i guess it wouldn't be a long term relationship because i wouldn't be able to get along with the chick 

353.30 354.02 B: (( mm )) 

356.45 357.20 B: (( mm )) 

356.57 361.15 A: it would probably be a physical relationship and it wouldn't really get anywhere

386.13 389.13 B: (( mm [noise] [mn] )) 

386.65 392.72 A: i wouldn't really look into that but if she's you know pretty good looking and has a personality to go with it then you know

410.94 411.50 B: (( [mn] )) 

412.50 415.17 A: she's about at least a seven out of ten you know 

415.30 416.35 A: (( it's all right ))

468.02 470.40 B: checking time time's almost up so 

471.81 474.95 B: um trying to think what else is there

478.56 481.29 B: personality of course looks 

481.67 485.66 B: (( what about education do the girls have to be smart )) 

484.58 492.43 A: uh i don't really care if she's a dumbass you know as long as she you know has a good personality you know she's down for me then i'd probably marry her 

492.55 493.93 B: (( mm mm [mn] )) 

494.47 499.51 B: and then would you in a situation that that she has a different opinion than you do 

500.21 511.73 A: then i would compromise like if i wanted you know watch some football and she wanted to watch some ballet then i'd watch you know football for like third and fourth quarter and she can watch ballet until that's when it starts yeah yeah yeah 

505.88 506.77 B: oh

545.63 547.83 A: (( yeah yeah yeah yeah for sure for sure [mn] )) 

549.04 551.22 B: (( [mn] trying to think what else um )) 

556.19 563.58 B: [sigh] i guess it's the same thing that we believe in her personality's the only thing personality and looks and she gotta be the same 

564.38 569.56 B: well would situation that some fine ass girls you met you know 

566.59 567.63 A: yeah for sure
