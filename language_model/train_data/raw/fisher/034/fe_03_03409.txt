230.66 233.09 B: [laughter] 

232.21 238.72 A: now but i i i've a lot i've got a lot more wisdom though [noise] now that i'm a little older so [noise] i guess 

236.47 237.43 B: mhm 

239.44 253.66 A: [noise] i'm able to [sigh] you know see those things and and i want uh you know if i have a female who's dating me i want her to see those type of faults in me too and [sigh] let me know whether or not she can deal with it [noise] [laughter] or not 

251.65 255.92 B: yeah that's true 'cause that's what they what do they say there's things that uh 

256.09 265.39 B: i can't remember how it goes but actually when you're first dating or something there's things that annoy you [sigh] when you get married they really become bigger problems and like i said you should know that already 

263.69 264.86 A: (( oh )) 

265.08 266.98 A: okay right 

265.60 273.10 B: but but people i think try to look over this and think oh he'll change but they won't well most people if they snore that's not something they can change or 

272.52 274.59 A: yeah right 

273.10 282.84 B: you know and and the smacking in the food a lot of people don't even realize they're doing that [sigh] so [laughter] when they're by themselves see they don't know better [laughter] [laughter] 

276.89 279.60 A: (( mm yeah [mn] exactly )) 

280.50 289.23 A: mhm exactly like what what are you talking about i'm smacking too loud oh [laughter] that's so true

289.34 295.53 A: (( you know um [noise] [mn] i don't know um [lipsmack] as far as um [noise] )) 

296.38 298.06 A: [lipsmack] what would [noise] [sigh] 

298.91 313.63 A: i don't know what [noise] besides their you know [sigh] when when you say lifetime partner do is that something you know that you think i mean 'cause you sound like you might be a little bit older than me um is that something that [sigh] that you look for [sigh] 

308.93 311.08 B: mhm i am i'm fifty 

313.72 324.89 A: uh you think that would be something to look for when you're when you're younger or you know how at what age do you look for someone to really settle down with for a long time or is there any specific age 

324.79 328.81 B: [sigh] [sigh] i don't know that there's a specific age i do think 

330.41 332.61 B: well i don't know it's ever but i w- i think 

332.74 338.13 B: the little older you the maturer you are about a situation i think you've got a better chance that it's going to 

336.41 338.03 A: [noise] that's it [noise] all 

338.33 339.60 B: last 

338.56 340.45 A: (( right okay [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

339.68 348.93 B: you know i mean there's the few people i know that have gotten married at sixteen seventeen eighteen and a very few of 'em are still married to that person a lot of them have 

346.80 348.29 A: (( [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

349.27 355.65 B: divorced moved on or just divorced and stayed single but [sigh] it seems like the older people get 

356.33 369.02 B: that's when they realize how much more important a companionship is like you say [sigh] somebody to go you know that likes the same things somebody to go out to eat with somebody to go to dinner with somebody to go to the movies [sigh] just travel with or something like that um 

365.52 367.12 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm [lipsmack] okay [noise] yeah )) 

369.03 375.46 B: one lady i worked with she was one of the girls that got married at sixteen and at about forty something her husband divorced her 

375.12 377.94 A: [noise] [noise] wow they were they were married till they were sixteen

379.97 391.92 B: and when she was about forty six she remarried and she said [laughter] that they should pass a law that you can't get married till you're forty five at least because she figured [sigh] then you were mature enough to know what you wanted 

387.90 389.00 A: wow 

391.68 392.70 A: mhm 

391.74 397.85 B: know some things about yourself and be able to go into a relationship looking at the long term

408.17 409.41 A: (( okay [noise] )) 

411.45 412.59 B: um 

412.60 420.11 B: [lipsmack] let's see she was one hundred and two and a half when she passed away he was ninety four [sigh] they were married about seventy i think it was seventy two or seventy three years

419.94 421.42 A: wow okay 

420.79 423.25 B: so they went in it for the long haul but

439.43 440.32 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

441.22 443.85 A: (( yeah mhm yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

442.84 444.79 B: there's no commitment or 

445.09 447.67 B: anything and i think if people realized that 

448.03 453.13 B: you know the bad thing is if and i know i- nobody's perfect that's what people need to realize but of 

452.46 453.82 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

453.21 463.41 B: course there are some things you can overlook more than you can others [laughter] [laughter] [sigh] but if they would just realize that they're not perfect neither is the person they're interested in that 

456.04 459.28 A: (( uh yeah exactly [laughter] yeah mhm mhm )) 

461.88 463.21 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm ))

466.23 468.69 B: big enough you can't get over 'em 

468.92 477.12 B: or are they things that they can live with they can try to work around [sigh] they can talk about it see if there's any way to adjust them and if not 

477.10 478.14 A: (( [noise] okay )) 

477.16 481.60 B: but some people divorce for some of the stupidest reasons 

480.98 484.37 A: [noise] [laughter] yeah [laughter] exactly yeah 

482.03 485.71 B: you know and um and of course they say now the biggest one is money

491.46 492.48 B: you know they 

492.61 503.66 B: most of them have got a car they've got a home they're not into the money thing they've got all that they've had a job maybe retired but now they're looking for somebody to spend their time with 'cause
