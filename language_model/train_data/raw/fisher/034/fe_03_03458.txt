0.64 1.86 A: hello 

0.77 3.25 B: hello my name's todd 

2.68 4.63 A: hi todd i'm gayle 

4.72 5.77 B: hi gayle 

5.45 6.54 A: how are you 

6.69 9.89 B: good it's my first time in this so uh 

8.58 9.63 A: oh 

9.99 14.30 B: (( i so so be gentle [laughter] )) 

11.85 22.48 A: [laughter] no it's pretty pretty easy [mn] um [lipsmack] the topic is what do you think the most important thing is to look for in a life partner in your li- in a life partner 

21.74 22.86 B: mhm 

22.79 25.03 A: uh for me i would say 

26.02 28.38 A: um somebody who's a like faith 

28.68 31.40 A: that's most important to me first of all 

30.78 31.99 B: (( [mn] okay )) 

31.98 37.11 A: and then somebody who [mn] you know you're going to grow with you want to go in the same direction 

37.25 38.15 B: sure 

37.99 48.27 A: um so you know through to 'cause you know it's rough in the beginning like you and your life with someone you pick in the beginning it's not going to be smooth sailing it's like two rivers 

48.36 49.17 B: right 

48.39 53.75 A: you know when they come together it's like rough water and then further down the line it smooths out but 

54.22 61.53 A: you know you have to be able to get through the rough time and then grow together and you can't do that with somebody you have nothing in common with 

61.57 69.02 B: sure no i definitely agree with that i think uh yeah i think it's like that someone that uh you have something in common with and i think it's 

69.04 74.91 B: um you know important to follow your heart a lot of times with that but also uh 

74.83 89.30 B: maybe uh use your head a little bit and that but uh i don't know i guess i believe mostly in following your heart and finding somebody who's compatible likes to do the same things and similar interests and all that kind of thing so you can uh can do things together 

89.57 91.53 B: and all that and learn about each other 

92.23 102.40 A: [mn] i think another thing um you have to have similar goals you know you if you want kids don't marry somebody who doesn't want them thinking you may be able to change 'em later 

92.44 93.14 B: (( so )) 

99.98 101.87 B: oh right 

102.33 103.26 B: right 

102.79 109.64 A: you know what you see right now is most likely what you're going to get [laughter] it may get worse but [laughter] it may not get better 

109.74 116.67 B: well sometimes but sometimes uh also what you see is what you want to see and then the you see something else later on so 

116.96 118.55 B: that can happen too 

118.28 122.10 A: yeah and th- that that may not be a good thing later on though 

122.18 123.04 B: yeah 

122.55 123.80 A: [laughter] 

123.16 130.60 B: e- exactly exactly so uh yeah i think that sounds pretty much what uh what i look for um 

130.70 142.42 B: probably somebody a little bit closer to your age is probably better too uh you know i've uh dated people that are considerably younger and it it only lasts for so long so somebody close to your age is probably important too 

142.34 147.12 A: yeah i've never really thought about that um i mean i guess if they came you know 

147.11 159.72 A: came along and it worked out it just worked out i mean i never went looking for anybody of like twenty years of my senior or [laughter] you know ten years my junior but if it just worked out that way it would just work out 

155.31 157.02 B: right 

159.75 161.69 B: right right mm 

160.63 165.60 A: um now basically another thing is someone who likes to have fun you 

166.19 175.69 A: know i i'm i like to just do spontaneous things you know and i don't like somebody that all they want to do is just sit around and watch t._v. 

170.35 172.03 B: right 

175.73 176.68 B: right 

176.47 179.15 A: you know t._v.'s always going to be there 

177.07 177.91 B: unless 

179.30 182.20 B: unless it's uh h._b._o. on a sunday night 

181.62 187.95 A: [laughter] gotcha line up all picked out [mn] [laughter] 

184.85 186.18 B: [laughter] 

186.62 187.99 B: (( [laughter] yeah [mn] )) 

188.14 189.19 A: yeah 

188.20 194.40 B: but uh but yeah uh that's for sure um i think i like uh also 

194.44 198.33 B: uh like to find somebody like in a similar area to 

198.24 212.15 B: um you know so you can go out and do things like in the same area like living in the city you can uh you know walk or cab or do that kind of stuff and it's kind of cool to find somebody there you don't have to go uh trucking out into the suburbs or whatever 

206.00 208.08 A: yeah 

212.80 216.62 A: uh what about somebody that takes uh pride in theirself 

216.75 222.72 A: you know they work hard to exercise kind a eat try to eat right in america 

217.01 218.36 B: yeah 

222.73 225.50 A: uh you know take pretty good care of theirself 

222.84 224.54 B: yeah 

227.06 230.54 A: i don't want anybody just sitting around waiting to die 

233.47 236.13 A: that's um definitely important to me 

237.54 248.17 A: so if somebody who wants kids it'd be nice to have you know their dad around when the important stuff came like you know graduations and weddings and kids of their own 

248.91 252.29 A: you can't really do that if you're not taking good care of yourself 

253.49 254.28 A: hello 

255.78 258.25 B: for sure that is something you have to do you have to uh 

258.29 263.61 B: take care of yourself so you feel better and uh you know enjoy other people more and all that kind of stuff too so 

263.90 266.45 B: so yeah it all feeds on itself that's for sure 

266.75 268.11 B: that's for sure 

268.39 270.04 B: yeah 

268.40 272.66 A: now let me ask you this um from a man's perspective 

272.33 273.43 B: mhm 

272.82 280.64 A: do you do you guys really think about whether you want a stay at home type like if you wanted kids do you want to stay at home 

280.93 285.35 A: type mom you know somebody who would be comfortable doing that or 

283.32 284.48 B: uh 

285.26 294.57 B: sometimes i mean uh but i think like you know you think about a balance or or whatever you'd like you know a uh your partner to be is a 

294.70 306.42 B: you know if you want somebody that just sits at home and does nothing i guess some guys want that but you know i think i'd rather have like someone that you know can do some of the things at home but also have independent activities that they do 

306.15 307.18 A: right 

306.91 317.76 B: and make sure of things uh i guess if somebody just wanted you know their partner to stay at home all the time they don't want anybody too exciting you know they don't have any interests of their own or 

317.81 318.93 A: yeah 

319.69 321.39 B: yeah 

320.21 328.62 A: i don't know that's kind of pretty selfish too if you think about it you know it's kind of like they just want them there to tend to their needs and forget about whatever they need 

329.11 332.92 B: yeah somebody can do your laundry and cook for you and clean up [noise] 

331.42 332.93 A: [laughter] 

333.04 334.40 B: yeah 

334.72 339.50 B: that's for sure that's that's kind of like a mother that's getting a mother yeah [noise] 

335.41 337.13 A: [laughter] 

337.44 339.38 A: yeah right 

339.59 345.93 B: yeah but uh i don't know do do you think that uh do women think about guys in that way what they do 

346.00 356.05 A: i think you know more of us like a control issue you know is he gonna w- w- you know want me to do this is he gonna do it you know [mn] like i have to be limited by 

349.44 350.38 B: right 

356.13 366.43 A: this is he gonna want me to feed these people does he want me to keep in touch with my family does he have problem with my mother in law when my mother comes to town yo know things like that um 

364.01 366.15 B: (( right yeah )) 

366.75 368.86 A: just something to look out for 

368.85 369.84 B: yeah 

370.56 371.63 B: (( yeah just so )) 

372.24 376.32 B: you're just looking out for patterns it wouldn't be good like family connections and things like that 

375.93 377.74 A: yeah 

377.14 377.95 B: yeah 

377.93 386.82 A: yeah i know women we tend to look at the way guys you know if their mom is around and try to how they treat their mothers 

383.53 385.87 B: right how they treat 'em 

386.56 387.37 B: right 

386.91 391.43 A: and i don't know if guys kind of look at the same relationship like um 

391.58 403.11 A: you know is she really daddy's little girl to a point where it's gonna be ha- kind of hard to break her of that because you know once you get married you know you can't be running to daddy every time you want a new dress 

403.46 406.51 B: yeah i'm sure that depends on the individual but uh 

406.61 416.22 B: you know once again probably just uh family connection's important you know if if you know if you're looking for someone that would uh want to have family or whatever how well they get along with their family 

416.44 419.98 B: you know that's probably pretty important to me anyways 

420.66 421.45 B: (( so )) 

421.39 422.27 A: (( [mn] )) 

421.94 423.48 B: (( uh yeah so ))

429.17 430.91 B: [laughter] 

431.86 439.65 B: oh okay all right but uh yeah i like i said [mn] i guess there's stuff i look for as people do have a life and uh 

439.52 449.14 B: you know do have independent activities and who do do care about family and you know things like that and take care of themselves i mean all that stuff's good stuff 

448.87 452.13 A: i don't know about you but i like to be around a lot of people 

449.81 450.37 B: (( [mn] )) 

452.28 457.28 A: and i do and you know i tend to [mn] like want 

452.42 453.68 B: you do or don't 

454.65 455.66 B: right

462.07 463.15 B: (( yeah right )) 

466.09 467.00 B: right
