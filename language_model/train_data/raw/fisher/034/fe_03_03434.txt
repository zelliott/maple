174.79 186.53 A: that's nice you know if you if you don't have a compatibility if he liked to be outside and you just liked inside it would be difficult because you'd never spend any uh fun time together

206.70 207.66 A: uh-huh 

207.23 208.17 B: yeah 

207.83 220.85 A: that's v- very possible it's it's funny that they you know they do call at different times when i signed up i did indicate you know the hours that i knew i would be home and if i was home i'd be able to talk 

218.17 218.99 B: yeah 

220.40 221.43 B: yeah 

220.82 226.72 A: because there are certain times of the day that i just wouldn't have the time to pick up the phone and spend any time 

226.30 227.50 B: yeah 

227.17 230.72 A: but uh [sigh] well how long are you married 

231.22 234.60 B: (( yeah ah ten eleven years )) 

233.99 235.14 A: okay 

235.44 242.04 A: um i'm i ours is a second marriage and we're we've been married it'll be twenty four years this year 

241.63 243.28 B: yeah oh okay 

242.34 251.14 A: yeah and uh so if if you know the first time i didn't do a real good job [laughter] so 

248.77 250.54 B: (( [laughter] )) 

251.09 261.20 A: so you get to know the things that you um you dislike or that made you unhappy and you know what to look for the second time i think a little better 

257.70 258.59 B: yeah 

261.09 262.87 B: okay yeah 

261.78 269.00 A: and um and that was one of the things you know we have a real trust in each other and that's so important 

267.53 270.62 B: that's good yeah are you christians 

270.76 273.36 A: yeah i i was raised catholic 

272.94 273.77 B: uh-huh 

273.42 277.73 A: uh-huh he he was raised in a pentecostal church 

277.05 278.18 B: (( oh okay )) 

277.88 289.70 A: so our you know our c- our religious background is a little different but it's similar enough for both of us um you know we both believe in god we both pray 

283.19 284.26 B: yeah 

289.41 290.41 B: yeah 

289.81 295.37 A: we um we don't always go to church but but you know we do um 

295.58 299.26 A: we try to adhere to the golden rule let me put it that way 

298.98 300.01 B: (( mm mm-kay mm )) 

299.97 300.91 A: you know 

301.23 302.58 A: so um 

303.01 310.60 A: i'm trying to think of what other things i i would think that are important in a life partner so someone you know 

310.88 313.47 A: someone who's willing to share the load 

312.39 315.99 B: share everything yeah that's what i think more important yeah 

315.39 318.98 A: yeah yeah because if do you work 

318.71 321.65 B: mm yeah full time [laughter] both we both work 

320.21 328.81 A: yeah so you you need someone who's willing to share the load because if they're not willing to you're putting in a full time job 

328.71 336.74 A: out of the house and then a full time job in the house and it's important that you have somebody who's willing to help out and share the load 

331.11 332.61 B: yeah 

336.66 337.53 B: yeah 

337.31 340.23 A: it's um you know it's it's uh 

340.61 345.83 A: it's important it's important i've seen a lot of people unhappy because 

345.91 355.00 A: uh women go home from work and they have to do everything at home husband's sitting there waiting for dinner and has no intention of helping out 

354.92 356.39 B: yeah [laughter] 

355.09 358.79 A: and that's that makes life a little hard 

357.34 359.02 B: (( difficult yeah )) 

358.91 361.41 A: yeah but um 

361.62 365.66 A: um how did you meet your husband 

363.93 366.80 B: um ours was an arranged marriage 

366.98 367.87 A: uh-huh 

367.52 370.85 B: yeah we are from india so our custom 

369.11 370.30 A: okay 

370.91 375.71 B: you know over there is like it's mostly arranged marriages parent your parents 

376.26 378.43 B: (( pick the prior you )) 

378.22 379.21 A: uh-huh 

378.89 380.41 B: (( know your spouse )) 

380.98 392.01 A: okay that's that's interesting we had a friend um a a young fellow that uh stayed with us for a while he was our children's age um you know they were in their 

381.66 382.76 B: yeah 

391.91 400.96 A: uh early twenties and all and his parents he was from india and his parents were still there they were both in the military in india 

400.57 401.42 B: oh 

401.67 414.13 A: and but he he did not get married there he he came to this country he rode horses and he found again someone he was very compatible with a girl over here who 

407.97 408.85 B: oh 

413.58 414.24 B: (( mm )) 

414.24 417.98 A: loved horses and who knew how to ride and 

418.56 425.86 A: they eventually got married and they gave lessons on horseback riding and all and you know they had a great compatibility there 

425.47 427.08 B: yeah that's nice 

426.48 429.90 A: yeah yeah it was very nice because 

428.75 436.48 B: yeah it's nice to talk to you too but i didn't know what kind of program this is the first time i'm you know participating in this program so 

433.89 434.79 A: yeah 

436.46 443.96 A: well this this is interesting because um yesterday i spoke to someone and the topic was pets 

436.59 437.64 B: [laughter] 

438.50 439.32 B: yeah 

443.72 446.55 B: (( oh they change the topic every day )) 

444.58 445.58 A: so 

446.35 455.11 A: yeah ev- evidently they do um the um yesterday it was pets and the person i spoke to today earlier 

446.78 447.55 B: uh-huh 

455.07 464.60 A: we had a similar conversation to the one we're having now and um she told me that she had had a call yesterday and she had spoken about pets too 

458.28 459.06 B: (( uh yeah )) 

464.28 467.41 B: uh uh oh okay every day it's kind of like every day 

464.90 466.15 A: so i guess 

467.08 468.97 A: yeah i guess so 

467.55 471.60 B: so how do they get the feedback they record our conversation mm ah 

469.59 470.48 A: pardon 

471.66 482.76 A: i think that they probably listen to it um i'm not exactly sure what they're looking for but i would imagine since it's a linguistic department um 

483.24 495.49 A: perhaps they're listening to the different um accents from different parts of the country or um the the the words you use perhaps you know i'm i'm really not sure 

486.73 487.72 B: (( yeah )) 

492.41 493.39 B: uh-huh 

495.16 496.01 B: (( oh )) 

495.61 498.25 A: but i've found it very interesting 

497.69 500.07 B: yeah it's an interesting thing yeah 

499.53 504.93 A: [laughter] the uh the lady i talked to earlier today was from wisconsin 

504.71 505.79 B: (( oh )) 

505.33 510.06 A: and then yesterday i talked to a young man who was in college in boston 

509.86 511.07 B: oh 

510.78 515.54 A: so you do get you know a variety of people to talk to and it's interesting 

514.46 527.82 B: yeah yeah i don't think i can you know right now my son was crying here and husband took him from me from my side and went downstairs that's why i was able to talk usually my son is attached to me so 

524.40 525.36 A: yes 

527.40 530.87 A: oh i know children are like that at that age

537.18 538.19 B: yeah 

541.99 548.20 A: the compatibility has to you know uh involve the the wanting of a family 

544.27 545.17 B: yeah 

547.52 548.65 B: yeah 

548.09 558.53 A: you know some people uh although they might desire marriage they're not interested in children and if there isn't a compatibility there that would be a real problem
