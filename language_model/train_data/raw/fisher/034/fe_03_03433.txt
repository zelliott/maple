13.90 15.19 B: oh really 

14.62 17.19 A: yeah we're really bicoastal here 

17.20 18.04 B: (( [laughter] )) 

18.28 25.99 B: i didn't know that they i thought since it was ten i thought they just used people in in uh pennsylvania 

25.48 29.86 A: no the woman i talked to yesterday was in virginia falls church so 

30.09 34.46 A: anyhow what do you think is the most important thing in a life partner 

32.78 33.60 B: [laughter] 

34.70 35.85 B: uh 

36.42 39.98 B: i'm still trying to figure that out [laughter] 

39.33 48.64 A: [laughter] um i would have i know this is v- very generic i'd have to just general general compatibility 

49.07 50.14 A: (( um )) 

49.56 50.81 B: yeah 

50.33 51.13 A: i 

51.25 57.51 A: was married nine years the first time it was a a disaster but i was very young 

57.96 59.30 A: and now i'm 

59.52 64.36 A: sixty years old i've been married for six and a half years to the most wonderful man in the world 

65.35 65.91 B: (( [mn] )) 

65.83 70.02 A: bec- and i think it works because we are so much alike 

71.00 73.66 A: and because we can just hang loose with each other 

75.48 77.55 A: and just see the 

75.88 76.51 B: (( mm )) 

77.57 85.17 A: cuteness in our idiosyncrasies rather than be bugged by idiosyncrasies [laughter] but i think that's something too that comes with age 

86.35 87.52 B: yeah 

88.79 89.88 A: (( so what do you )) 

89.07 89.87 B: (( so you )) 

90.02 90.74 B: (( [mn] )) 

90.05 94.25 A: what is it you look for that you think you're not finding so far 

93.81 95.16 B: [laughter] 

95.37 96.41 B: (( um )) 

96.58 98.55 B: well i am twenty nine 

98.59 101.19 B: i've never been married but i've had 

101.33 104.09 B: several relationships 

104.19 105.28 B: um 

105.59 113.88 B: [lipsmack] i don't know i've found sometimes i would have a relationship and it would end and i would swing the complete opposite direction personality wise 

113.60 118.03 A: oh yeah they say every relationship is a reaction to the previous relationship 

114.25 115.16 B: (( in the next )) 

117.39 120.80 B: yeah and so it was starting to get confusing [laughter] 

120.50 121.53 A: yeah 

121.37 124.95 B: but i think um i have a better idea 

125.28 127.51 B: i don't know i want um 

128.94 130.08 B: someone who is 

130.31 132.98 B: a good person who is very nice to me 

132.58 133.69 A: mhm 

133.25 136.98 B: but also who's not a doormat you know someone who's also challenging 

136.79 137.83 A: right 

137.44 140.03 B: and they're exciting at the same time 

139.85 140.78 A: yeah 

141.36 142.51 B: so 

143.52 146.08 B: i guess that sorta balance [laughter] 

147.05 148.43 A: it's hard 

148.93 153.90 A: it it's so difficult everybody's looking and nobody can find what they want um 

155.12 166.71 A: [lipsmack] i had given up that i would ever find anybody especially at my age you know i was fifty one when we met i had grandchildren i almost didn't go meet him 'cause i just had been there done that attitude 

168.54 170.68 A: and it's absolutely made in heaven 

170.97 171.94 A: and i 

172.40 180.96 A: i think the most important thing is that we just genuinely like each other as human beings if we weren't married we'd still be really good friends 

181.90 182.63 B: mm 

183.21 186.56 B: so when you have an argument how do you feel like you deal with it 

186.37 188.81 A: do ya wanna know the truth we haven't had one yet 

188.91 190.61 B: really you're kidding 

190.31 194.25 A: i'm not kidding we've known each other for nine years 

192.03 192.80 B: [laughter] 

193.98 195.70 B: and you've never argued 

195.32 197.11 A: we've never had an argument 

197.21 198.62 B: that's amazing 

198.61 206.67 A: it's always uh you know if something comes up well what do you think about this well this is what i think what do you think and then we just sorta say yeah well okay you know 

207.10 217.71 A: we're able to hang loose but see we're very fortunate we don't have either of the major stressors that relationships have we don't have any money problems because at this stage in our lives 

218.19 224.94 A: we're you know we're fairly financially secure and we don't have any children to raise i have a grown daughter 

225.38 231.98 A: and it's just the two of us and so without kids to worry about and no money problems i mean that really helps 

233.18 233.78 B: mm 

233.50 237.75 A: 'cause those are two of the big stressors in any relationship 

237.30 238.52 B: yeah 

239.46 241.94 B: yeah i'm finding it hard to um 

242.26 253.34 B: to i have a boyfriend but it's hard to even have one [laughter] because we both said today that you know we once we met each other that uh all our money went out the window [laughter] 

253.22 254.55 A: oh cry me 

253.61 258.53 B: and now we go out well 'cause we go out and do things a lot which is a lotta fun 

256.35 257.63 A: yeah 

259.22 264.67 B: but um you know it costs money to go out that often and neither of us has any 

262.64 263.67 A: yeah 

265.70 269.85 A: yeah they are a lotta things you can do that are inexpensive or free 

266.44 267.30 B: [laughter] 

268.85 269.90 B: yeah 

271.02 273.87 A: especially in a a metropolitan area 

275.08 276.53 B: yeah 

277.67 278.49 B: (( yeah )) 

279.75 280.69 A: so 

281.50 287.40 B: [mn] well you have so many things at night that you could go to [laughter] it costs a lot [laughter] 

284.24 285.65 A: yeah 

286.98 288.32 A: yeah i guess 

290.25 291.46 B: (( but um )) 

291.09 297.37 A: so so i've but i tend to agree with you that general niceness is the most important thing that i always look for 

298.65 299.60 B: yeah 

298.77 302.73 A: my when my husband and i first talked on the telephone 

303.05 313.74 A: i could just get the sense from the way he was talking to me and the questions he was asking he had at least a mental list you know do you smoke [laughter] you know how tall are you do you have children 

313.84 315.53 A: um this sorta thing 

315.76 323.86 A: he says he didn't but i mean he really d- he admitted c- certain things would be relationship breakers like a smoker was out of the question 

323.97 327.96 A: then he asked me what are your requirements and i said nice 

328.20 330.06 A: huh i said nice 

330.34 339.57 A: i said tall is good 'cause i'm very tall but you know not a requirement but i mean he's just gotta be really nice [laughter] and and after that 

339.65 346.58 A: you see you know whatever if you have enough in common but if they're not nice people i can't be bothered 

348.06 349.00 B: yeah 

350.79 356.50 A: and you really learn you know how they treat if you see how they treat other people then you'll know how they'll treat you 

356.53 360.67 A: the first time we went to movies 'cause as i say we we are both rather tall 

360.70 373.27 A: i went to sit down and he said no no we can't sit there i said what's wrong he says well the people behind us won't be able to see because they're kinda short and we're so tall and i thought my goodness if he has that much consideration for total strangers 

373.58 379.32 A: you know what must he be like uh as a friend or somebody who really when he really cares about you 

381.17 382.48 B: (( that's true )) 

381.39 382.77 A: and he's wonderful 

385.74 387.61 B: you know i've noticed when a 

387.97 389.73 B: [mn] the way 

389.80 393.70 B: previous boyfriends the way they've spoken to their mother or 

393.35 394.55 A: (( mhm )) 

394.39 396.35 B: that makes a difference [laughter] 

396.09 398.03 A: it does make a big difference 

396.59 403.87 B: you know if they are nice or the way that they argue i've noticed that if i've seen someone get angry or argue with another person 

404.09 408.56 B: i find that they typically within time will will they argue with you that way 

408.16 409.19 A: of course 

409.12 410.99 B: if they're screaming at someone 

410.82 411.78 A: yeah 

412.16 414.01 A: oh that's a bad sign 

415.19 416.63 B: yeah 

419.02 423.57 A: well i hope you find somebody where do you look when you or do you make an effort 

422.50 426.45 B: well i i'm seeing someone now and it's going really well [lipsmack] 

425.78 427.34 A: well that's good 

427.66 429.05 B: but um 

429.84 433.22 B: (( the last relationship i was in the person was emotionally abusive )) 

433.22 434.26 A: uh-oh oh 

434.05 435.53 B: (( very violent )) 

436.00 439.62 B: and it was the first time in my life i ever encountered someone like that 

439.48 441.86 A: yeah there's a lot of 'em 

440.35 441.77 B: (( and that was very hard )) 

442.41 443.58 B: yeah 

443.92 450.39 A: so many guys have power issues see that's another thing that's important when i i guess i group it under compatibility 

450.83 453.92 A: is that you don't have power issues 

454.26 456.94 A: neither one of us has to be in control 

458.05 460.30 A: we can just we'll just hang looser 

460.99 464.10 A: i it's hard to describe sorta you know 

464.60 467.14 A: and we take turns um 

467.16 476.74 A: you picked the movie last time 'cause he likes he's into special effects he even gets the special effects magazine so we see movies for the special effects i wouldn't ordinarily see 

476.82 484.92 A: but then he'll see chick flicks [laughter] with me that he wouldn't ordinarily go see you know and it's all it's a little trade off 

485.02 486.90 A: and that's what it should be about 

488.61 489.53 B: yeah 

491.30 491.95 B: mm 

493.97 497.64 B: so why do you why do you feel that your first marriage didn't work 

494.37 495.33 A: (( well )) 

497.91 499.41 A: oh god 

499.54 501.68 A: first of all i was twenty years old 

501.60 502.48 B: (( oh )) 

502.16 507.91 A: he was a nice old fashioned italian boy at heart which i didn't figure out 'til later 

508.64 510.84 A: i am very independent 

510.85 524.84 A: i wanted my education we got married after i did two years of college and i finished college after we were married and he was happy with that 'cause he was supporting us and i was going to school but when i got a job and i was making money 

525.76 527.49 A: it really bothered him 

527.84 531.21 A: 'cause he really he felt he lost control 

531.34 535.06 A: and to me you know i don't get this control business 

535.24 536.54 A: we're adults 

536.88 541.35 A: i remember once uh when i had to travel out of state on business 

541.53 548.91 A: and his secretary said well you're lucky he lets you and i looked at her and i said in front of him let me he's my husband not my father 

548.97 556.30 A: and i saw the look on his face and i realized oh you'd really like to have that kinda power wouldn't you [laughter] i thought this just isn't gonna work 

556.18 571.06 A: plus he just didn't want the same kind of life i wanted and i told him this when we were dating i wanted to travel i want to see the world and he said yeah yeah me too well when it came time to travel he said hey you wanna see big cities i'll take you downtown l. a. 

571.75 582.71 A: um and that's the kind of life he's had he he sits at home with his dog he he has been out of the country maybe twice in the last thirty three years since we broke up 

571.84 572.50 B: mm 

583.07 588.54 A: and i've been all over the world i've had a ball and i never could have done that if i stayed with him 

589.98 598.60 A: he just would've made it impossible he doesn't like opera we went to the opera once and he made sure i didn't enjoy it i was ready to leave at intermission 

590.19 591.01 B: mm
