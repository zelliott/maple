129.03 130.69 A: and um 

131.41 132.60 A: i guess

157.75 163.89 A: somebody that you can share that quality with i i think it makes life more fun [laughter] 

164.87 166.45 B: (( yeah mhm um )) 

166.83 171.02 B: i know a lot of people who have cheated on their partners so 

171.21 172.21 B: (( i'm )) 

172.48 179.42 B: [sigh] i'm i've almost acquired a phobia so that's um one major thing that i sort of look out for 

179.08 180.08 A: mhm 

180.21 190.37 B: uh just a guy who will be honest with me and that i can trust like go and leave him in the room with a million girls i know that nothing [laughter] is gonna happen 

187.20 188.25 A: (( [laughter] )) 

190.15 191.55 A: right 

191.01 194.21 B: w- i don't know everybody tells me dream on but 

194.60 199.02 A: yeah it it's really hard to find somebody like that 

199.27 204.67 A: you know 'cause i guess 'cause there's so many attractive women in the world and 

204.80 212.40 A: i know like out here in l._a. i mean it's like [laughter] there's so many beautiful women out here 

212.65 213.53 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

212.73 216.43 A: and i can see how men would be you know tempted 

216.73 225.19 A: to wanna like sample [laughter] sample the wares of all these beautiful women that they meet [laughter] 

220.75 221.58 B: but 

224.62 226.17 B: but in your opinion 

226.62 227.36 B: um 

226.71 227.70 A: mhm 

227.91 229.16 B: where does love 

229.22 232.08 B: fall into place you know 

232.48 234.93 A: [lipsmack] oh gosh 

235.76 236.67 A: (( mm )) 

237.17 243.65 A: i think you have to really be like really honest with yourself and really honest with the person 

243.89 246.45 A: that you're hooking up with 

247.17 248.71 A: and um 

249.19 250.43 A: [sigh] 

250.10 251.59 B: like do you think um 

251.03 259.75 A: i mean like oh and not like play these little g- head games you know that guys and girls play with each other you know 

261.09 261.80 B: (( i mean )) 

261.14 266.81 A: and just just i guess be more down to earth and more realistic about things 

267.71 268.53 B: (( well )) 

268.89 274.64 B: don't you think if someone loves someone they wouldn't um want to sample other people 

275.16 276.48 B: shouldn't they 

275.31 275.96 A: (( [mn] )) 

276.13 284.24 A: right but what but the point i'm making is that there's just so many attractive women around and 

285.33 286.38 A: um 

286.64 288.98 A: i don't know w- where did you say you're from 

288.88 290.34 B: virginia [laughter] 

289.80 295.00 A: oh you're in virginia have you ever been out here to in to l._a. or california 

294.86 296.38 B: yeah never [laughter] 

295.77 304.27 A: oh [laughter] well i don't know it's just that there's just so many really really attractive women out here i [sigh] 

298.12 299.09 B: (( i live uh-huh [noise] )) 

305.04 315.06 A: i can see how you know men would be tempted to like maybe if they were with somebody it seems like the guys out here are always looking 

314.98 321.06 A: for for the next best thing you know to come along like something better than what they've already got 

321.45 334.95 A: i don't know how men are where you are but i don't know it just seems like men out here are always like they're with somebody but they're always like looking around the corner to see what's coming to see if you know whatever's around the corner is better than what they've got 

335.05 345.38 A: and it's like like a lot of like game playing and head games and stuff like that that [sigh] people do out here maybe they do it more out here than they do where you 

345.05 345.78 B: um 

345.41 346.22 A: (( are )) 

345.86 350.03 B: maybe [laughter] maybe it's the whole hollywood thing i i don't really 

347.19 348.67 A: [laughter] 

349.42 351.19 A: yeah 

350.54 361.77 B: but when i lived in new york i lived there for five months i did actually uh see a lot of beautiful women around and i attribute that to the fashion industry 

358.60 359.72 A: mhm 

361.81 363.15 A: right 

362.24 365.20 B: yeah it's i mean it's basically the fashion capital 

365.29 368.99 B: so maybe just a lot of models live in new york or 

368.39 369.96 A: mhm 

369.35 370.40 B: um 

370.69 372.73 B: i don't know but i know what you mean and
