3.76 5.45 B: hey josh how ya doing 

5.24 6.92 A: uh good 

6.86 9.16 B: um you wanna start first or 

9.39 13.90 A: yeah okay um i think the most important thing 

14.05 16.75 A: (( um that )) 

19.61 22.36 A: that's well that she's not an idiot [laughter] 

22.75 25.12 A: that she's smart and [lipsmack] 

26.80 35.66 A: just knows or is kind of person that can figure me out and knows my strengths and weaknesses and uh 

36.22 47.35 A: can tell when i'm in a bad mood and just the kind of person that wants to get to know me and when she does knows how to act and every situation 

47.90 58.97 B: yeah i agree with that i would say someone who's not really manipulative is someone who'd you know who's not gonna try to really pull your strings and make life hard for ya and really kinda wanna get in the groove both you know 

59.36 61.05 B: being you know uh 

61.24 66.03 B: i guess civil you know and and be able to like you said not uh 

66.34 68.92 B: you know pick on on the weaknesses 

69.13 72.87 B: and try to work on each other's strengths and and work on each other's uh 

72.94 77.36 B: making one another a a better uh unit as one you know 

77.64 81.87 B: i i agree with that you know someone who's just not out there just to 

81.86 83.69 B: play games and and kinda 

83.57 98.06 B: jerk at your chain half the time you know and and test you all the time and you know and play games 'cause like as you know a lotta people play games i agree with that too you know and and i guess we've all been in that position where we've had girlfriends and you know basically uh 

85.21 86.17 A: [laughter] 

90.52 91.62 A: yeah 

97.91 103.15 B: you find out a year or two later that hey this isn't the person i thought it was and boom you know 

103.53 105.58 B: so i you you know it's 

105.82 109.48 B: i think when you look for a life partner you really wanna look for someone who's uh 

109.72 123.18 B: who's got uh you know first of all a nice disposition a good personality and uh someone who you know right off the bat isn't play games you know you know it's really hard not to play games because i guess we all play games inadvertently you know 

123.09 126.83 A: well yeah we yeah we kinda get sucked into it and we don't even realize it 

126.54 128.96 B: yeah yeah and uh 

129.25 133.46 B: but no no i i would have to agree with that as well you know 'cause there are a lot of 

133.53 141.88 B: people out there that really aren't out for anyone else's interests and they're really looking for maybe like a punching bag or someone to dump all their crap on you know 

141.66 142.38 A: [laughter] 

142.46 147.96 B: their baggage you know and that's and especially i think as we get older you know it's just more and more so 

148.12 156.77 B: i think as as as we're younger we're expected you know to actually have to go through that because of course it's a learning process but i i think as one matures 

156.95 166.76 B: you know and though age is really just a number as as you know but uh yet nevertheless i think you know through time you live and learn either learn the easy way or the hard way right josh 

166.40 168.56 A: oh it's always the hard way [laughter] 

167.74 168.93 B: yeah 

168.66 172.93 A: everyone says easy or hard way but everyone seems to go through the hard way 

173.67 179.14 B: yeah it seems like well sometimes you can't avoid the hard way 'cause you get blind sided right 

178.58 180.55 A: completely blind sided 

180.13 183.85 B: yeah it's kinda like getting hit by a mack truck or something you know you don't even know it's coming 

182.34 183.21 A: [laughter] 

184.01 191.62 A: well it's hard because like when you're looking you know at this age in basically bars and clubs i mean there's no 

192.41 197.77 A: it's really hard finding someone just out of the blue unless you get introduced by friends 

197.81 199.02 A: and then 

199.03 199.90 B: true 

199.59 204.02 A: then that's even a problem because if things don't work out 

204.83 215.91 A: then there's problems with you know the friendship can get into trouble like i've i've had that happen where it doesn't work out and you kind of your friend is stuck in the middle between the two of you 

215.85 223.52 A: and it just makes the friend completely not want to spend any time with you or her anymore 

215.89 216.84 B: yeah 

223.80 225.76 A: and it destroys everything 

226.53 228.53 B: yeah i agree you know and uh 

228.73 240.60 B: in a sense it can be you're right it can be good or bad because you never know and then let's say you're with that person a couple of years and then that person no longer talks to that friend so yeah it could be good or bad i guess right i mean 

240.63 255.41 B: you know maybe you've found a mate but then again you're not friends with that person that set you up or you're not friends with then you break up that girl and then there was some bad feelings 'cause that person might've dated at one time and you never really know what's behind the scenes you know all these other things pop up kinda like a 

252.97 254.07 A: yeah 

255.49 257.09 B: like mushrooms you know 

257.39 265.05 B: different scenarios i guess you weren't used to and then you never know what that friend told your other friend about what really they really said you know 

264.42 265.98 A: mhm 

265.38 271.64 B: even though we even though you do consider this person a close friend everybody talks a little bit about one another unfortunately you know 

271.86 273.90 B: even our closest friends will have 

273.94 276.71 B: you know most of them will have some sorta commentary 

276.54 277.89 A: oh yeah 

277.27 289.61 B: and the really quiet well if they're too quiet then that's maybe even worse because you really can't trust them then and you really find out why all of a sudden kind of like all of a sudden you find out wait a minute oh well this person really thought that about me you know 

289.83 300.73 B: or whatever yeah i agree with that too so yeah and then and then it's i think it's hard you know when you find a life mate it's good probably not to go on one those date lines the nine hundred lines those are can be quite difficult 

300.33 309.53 A: i've never done those i've just always been too it's just not my thing 'cause i i don't think it would work at all i've never seen that work for anyone even though 

306.58 307.48 B: yeah 

309.41 315.70 A: like i know of a girl who's getting married actually in june to a guy that she met over the internet 

315.61 316.56 B: wow 

315.90 317.92 A: and they're perfectly happy 

318.12 322.68 B: yeah i would say what do you think about three to five percent of those pan out i don't 

318.27 319.59 A: but 

321.92 323.40 A: yeah maybe 

323.08 324.80 B: know maybe three percent [laughter] 

325.03 326.97 B: maybe one percent you know 

327.33 332.61 B: 'cause you know they all lie too about their looks and how old they are and how much money they make and if they're balding or 

329.94 331.24 A: oh yeah 

332.62 336.48 B: or if the girl's you know got big ears or whatever right 

336.31 342.01 A: yeah i don't know how it well like the thing is they met they meet at like um what do you call it 

341.97 351.41 A: like different chat rooms for different things so they get all interested in you know you like the same music i do and let's meet and blah blah blah and 

351.39 358.79 A: i mean sometimes like i see them and you know they seem happy together but the question is do they really know each other besides 

359.20 361.17 A: you know the internet stuff 

360.78 365.52 B: yeah and how you know and how realistic is it i i mean are you i mean you're somewhat 

365.47 372.40 B: are you living in a dream world and are you truly as lonely as you're perceived to be by having to do this like going at this um 

372.35 373.89 B: for for an example 

373.84 381.99 B: you know um since we don't we're not mentioning names my friend's girlfriend actually well i don't know how i guess they're gonna have he doesn't really care i guess anymore but 

381.86 392.51 B: he's been talking she's been talking to his uh man you know across country for years and all they go is gab on the phone but then you know they turn out not to be what they what they told one another were you know 

391.88 393.30 A: yeah 

392.63 404.60 B: they send photos that are maybe twenty years old kinda like that one commercial years ago i don't know if you saw it well i don't know where you are but there was a commercial uh best buy it's a place where they sell electronics and the guy says he's like superman and they said you know he's looks more like uh 

394.88 395.51 A: [laughter] 

400.45 401.67 A: yeah 

405.14 408.37 B: you know more like uh a balding old guy 

407.67 408.40 A: [laughter] 

409.13 411.83 B: you know and then the woman says she looks like you know 

411.95 412.89 B: uh 

413.13 415.01 B: well she looks like uh 

416.16 419.75 B: cindy crawford and she turns out to you know look like you know 

420.80 422.42 B: yeah whatever 

422.57 432.38 B: so yeah i agree with that you know i think i you know on the basis of a good relationship it's always good to have that initial you know 'cause i think uh people a lotta people talk about first impressions you know 

432.77 441.62 B: those first impressions are very important and i think to deny that would be false because i think even we you know as men we want that good first impression too you know 

441.55 443.86 A: yeah but so many times they don't 

443.71 445.20 B: it's not the truth yeah 

444.50 451.01 A: yeah that's the bad thing about them and some people just base everything on it 

451.08 458.01 A: and it can i i don't understand people that just base everything on the first impression and then don't give things a second chance 

458.02 460.39 A: because i've seen that happen and it's just 

459.82 462.24 B: oh i agree with you oh i totally agree with you 

460.50 461.47 A: awful 

462.71 469.68 B: i totally agree with you on that point you know and uh women are kinda like i think women wanna hear like uh 

469.93 474.40 B: beautiful words you know they really like that they're big into words you know 

471.56 472.45 A: [mn] 

474.05 476.29 A: [laughter] and poetry and all that 

475.59 487.23 B: well yeah they wanna hear you know that you love 'em and all that and i think that's where men and women are different men wanna hear that too but they're they're not as so much i think vocal i think women are the better communicators 

486.81 487.92 A: yeah 

487.36 498.62 B: overall or they i don't i'm i'm not gonna say they talk more 'cause that wouldn't be right that would be kinda sexist but you notice how the women always wants to hear if the guy loves her all the time and you know you know they but uh 

499.15 502.73 B: i yeah i think it's important that you know and i think it's important that uh 

502.76 512.10 B: you know when you're talking about sociology i guess you've gotta look at the same income bracket i think it it works a lot better that way as well or at least on the same level in some way 

506.81 507.80 A: mhm 

512.34 513.52 A: yeah 

512.95 520.28 B: you know and i think it's important not to play a role of of who's weaker and who's stronger and then you know 'cause i think it falls into that a lot too 

520.73 528.26 B: i i think a lot of um i think it's important also i think it's important for men to somewhat play a little bit hard to get sometimes you know and not be too 

528.85 541.72 B: you know but then you know i think when a good when finding a good soul mate some some of the things just come naturally you know it's just there it's like wait hey i'm clicking with this person you know and and it could be on a phone call it could be at the mall it could be at mcdonalds you know 

541.77 549.75 A: that's true it's so much difference 'cause i just think that a soul mate's a kinda person you'll see and you both will know 

543.45 544.35 B: weird 

550.15 558.83 A: even though it's probably just idealistic but i mean i'm just hoping when i see her i'll know it and she'll know it and [laughter] that's it 

558.59 560.11 B: yeah you know 

558.85 562.13 A: and we just go it won't happen that way but 

561.88 566.93 B: yeah you never know i wouldn't you know i wouldn't count on anything anything's possible you you know 

566.94 574.53 B: they say love at first sight i don't know if i believe in love at first sight but i do believe in you know yeah lust and attraction you know that semi attraction at first sight 

570.18 571.09 A: lust 

574.78 575.88 B: but uh 

575.95 577.55 B: yeah i i um 

578.01 584.80 B: i think when you're picking your soul mate i don't think you should really try that hard if you're gonna go out and look actually look for a soul mate 

584.63 588.25 A: yeah that true it all depends where you're at and what you're looking for 

585.22 586.00 B: you know 

588.40 599.89 B: yeah yeah i think you're right do you wanna get married do you wanna have kids do you like dogs do you like cats are you allergic to pollen do you like you know are you a warm blooded cold blooded person do you like ski- you know they're really those factors that do
