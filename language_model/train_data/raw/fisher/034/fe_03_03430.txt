207.74 210.00 A: and they seem to have a lot of problems 

209.37 217.89 B: oh yeah yeah for [mn] yeah i i mean for for for for i mean for for for a man m- m- m- maturity ver- [mn] very important but for in women it's not that important i think 

217.18 218.89 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

217.86 225.90 B: [laughter] i i think well i have a different opinion yeah [laughter] um on on this topic on on on a maturity i i don't think maturity's that that important for 

225.94 231.73 B: (( you know for for girl a girl is not so so mature [laughter] i think )) 

226.07 226.77 A: right 

230.67 231.79 A: mhm 

231.74 234.50 B: so i hold a different opinion [mn] on 

234.77 236.93 B: this point yeah [mn] 

237.87 243.26 B: do you think uh loo- looks is ver- is important i mean look is important 

241.24 242.18 A: um 

243.60 244.95 A: (( mm i )) 

244.26 247.56 B: i think it's important but not it's not that important 

247.40 256.48 A: right i wouldn't say it's important but i think that a lot of times um people wouldn't you know wouldn't take the time to get to know you based on your looks [mn] 

248.24 249.08 B: yeah 

255.89 258.45 B: yeah yeah yeah yeah 

258.59 261.56 A: unf- i mean unfortunately i have like i don't 

261.73 263.86 A: that's what i think happens so 

265.40 267.08 B: (( yeah yeah [laughter] )) 

266.39 272.63 A: you know you don't you know people don't take the opportunity to get to know somebody it's like that new game show now that mr [laughter] personality 

273.18 275.23 A: with the masks and that [laughter] 

274.88 278.47 B: oh yeah with a mask whoa [laughter] oh [mn]

280.65 284.19 B: [laughter] okay with a with a mask it's it's a good idea 

280.95 281.62 A: yeah 

283.64 285.32 A: [laughter] 

284.37 292.27 B: that's a real good idea you know [laughter] [laughter] you will never [laughter] never know [laughter] who they're talking uh talking too [laughter] yeah 

286.05 287.14 A: (( [laughter] )) 

290.33 291.83 A: yep [laughter] 

293.74 294.48 B: (( uh )) 

295.15 296.35 B: [mn] what else 

296.46 300.81 A: um let's see well what in a lifetime partner 

300.86 305.30 A: uh i think we agreed on friendship and uh basic groundwork 

305.09 306.69 B: yeah yeah 

306.26 307.32 A: um 

309.86 312.08 A: hm i guess common goals 

312.40 314.08 A: would be important 

313.44 314.56 B: uh sorry 

314.34 315.84 A: common goal 

315.45 317.06 B: oh yeah that's very 

316.16 319.69 A: having the same ambition or a similar ambition 

318.62 320.70 B: wow wow [mn] 

320.88 327.08 B: yeah but [mn] i i don't think it's that it's it's not that that is im- important 

327.32 331.39 B: 'cause you know people may have a dif- may have a d- d- may have a d- 

332.12 337.54 B: d- d- d- different career so they they may not share the same goal on life 

337.51 340.98 A: well i i think i mean a different career's fine but 

341.01 348.48 A: um i think like you have to both want or or even wanting to have kids that has to be something that both people want 

346.89 351.67 B: oh yeah yeah oh yeah you mean this okay yeah i yeah 

349.31 353.60 A: yeah or or wanting to own a home versus you know not wanting

356.09 363.70 B: yeah and what else com- com- common goal and a common ground and um do you think a same hobby might be important 

363.55 364.51 A: um 

365.40 371.23 A: i think it would help but i i wouldn't think it's very impor- i wouldn't say it's it's an a 

366.92 368.18 B: yeah it help 

371.61 373.12 A: main reason 

374.11 375.89 A: for or against
