350.54 353.10 A: yes it does oh and about your kids though too

364.42 365.17 B: and i'm not 

365.38 369.52 B: patting myself on the back but just a little because i have 

367.73 370.02 A: you have to

384.82 385.93 B: was the breadwinner

390.09 392.47 A: yes they do 

395.70 400.56 A: that's that's a bad situation it's not it's not good for anybody 

401.08 406.47 B: exactly so it's kind of like now you're keeping yourself in place but it 

406.64 411.45 B: but in the same way keeping men in place and it's it's having control 

411.80 412.24 B: when 

412.58 414.20 B: they think they have control 

414.06 417.78 A: right an- well it technically goes back to love or money 

418.16 418.64 B: right 

418.57 419.76 A: you know because then 

419.49 419.90 B: right
