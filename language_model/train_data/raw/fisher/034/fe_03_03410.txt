3.65 4.89 A: hi karen 

4.69 16.84 B: hi [laughter] [sigh] so let's see life partners i didn't hear the topic the first time and uh so then i like waited till they just told me now again but [sigh] i i'm married are you married 

16.17 17.68 A: i am married 

17.08 18.16 B: you are okay 

18.13 20.53 A: uh for going on ten years 

20.40 24.36 B: [lipsmack] oh really we've been married for a little over eight 

21.30 22.19 A: yeah 

24.57 31.19 B: so [sigh] um and uh i guess the things that i look for i guess is just honesty and 

24.58 25.51 A: okay 

31.33 32.39 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

32.74 37.83 B: compatibility i guess of some sort that we're interested in the same stuff you know [sigh] 

37.14 39.18 A: (( yeah yeah the [laughter] )) 

38.10 46.76 B: kinda typical stuff you know it's been so many years since i've really thought about it [laughter] we've come so long from there you know [laughter] [sigh] [noise] 

46.01 52.57 A: yeah the first thing i thought of was compatibility as well i think it's important that your life partner [sigh] 

52.69 57.53 A: be more than just that you be more than just physically attracted to them that you um 

57.96 61.76 A: are friends with them like you want your partner to be your best friend [sigh] 

61.31 63.23 B: right yeah 

62.05 65.29 A: um [sigh] and actually [sigh] [mn] 

65.63 70.77 A: liking the same things helps um but also [sigh] uh 

71.46 73.70 A: complementing the other person [sigh] 

74.13 75.54 A: like uh [sigh] 

75.99 76.99 A: i'm 

76.38 77.30 B: yeah 

77.12 85.90 A: i'm laid back and my wife is outgoing i think that [sigh] we we tend to cover e- cover each other's weak areas 

79.50 80.60 B: yeah 

82.51 83.51 B: (( [cough] )) 

85.71 92.85 B: yeah that's exactly i agree with that too [sigh] that's how we are too my husband's the outgoing one and um 

87.14 88.13 A: so 

92.13 93.25 A: [laughter] 

92.78 101.98 B: he's very talkative and boisterous and and i'm the more of the shy one and [sigh] and i'm coming out of my shell now too after so many years but [sigh] it's 

102.13 107.22 B: like you said and he's very organized and i'm not so organized [laughter] 

106.34 108.96 A: yeah that's how i am i'm not the organized one 

108.53 116.41 B: really i wonder if that's the type of personality that's pretty typical you know those uh bunch of traits tend to go together [laughter] 

111.88 112.71 A: yeah 

114.52 117.65 A: yeah my wife is type a personality 

117.10 118.32 B: yeah 

118.30 121.36 A: the go get things done and [sigh] 

118.77 120.40 B: yeah he 

120.93 127.12 B: he's starting to relax a little bit more now but it's uh it's still really 

127.00 138.96 B: really in him pretty strongly but it's not a bad thing either but [sigh] you know he's getting at first he was r- very um [sigh] he had to get things done right now like the remote control would be gone 

128.94 129.89 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

138.55 139.77 A: [laughter] 

139.01 150.27 B: and he'd have to s- sit and search for that before he could actually watch any more t._v. [sigh] it's like okay you could go up and channel we could finish watching this program and then you could look for it [laughter] 

144.28 145.11 A: (( [noise] okay )) 

149.27 152.36 A: i think that's a guy thing yeah [laughter] 

150.67 152.96 B: is it [laughter] are you like that too 

152.49 153.34 A: oh [noise] 

153.83 154.80 B: whoops 

154.53 158.90 A: [sigh] um let's see the other things that popped into my head are uh 

159.28 160.62 A: [sigh] i think 

160.94 171.36 A: religion is important to have at least similar religious or spiritual values [sigh] um and then the other thing that i would look for in a partner 

162.67 164.11 B: yeah 

171.48 178.10 A: is somebody with a strong family background [sigh] that their family's important to them um [sigh] 

178.32 189.29 A: that they interact with their family and [sigh] and that sort of thing because i think that [sigh] i think the way people are raised [sigh] um tells a lot about how they're going to turn out 

181.12 182.25 B: yeah 

182.45 183.18 B: yeah 

189.42 190.61 B: yeah 

189.59 193.85 A: so having a strong family background would definitely be a plus in my book 

193.68 203.29 B: yeah [sigh] and uh like the religion i agree with that too it's um i don't think it's important what religion that you're involved in but [sigh] there's been a lot of um 

203.47 210.43 B: not necessarily you just hear a lot [sigh] of uh stories where people were different religions and it didn't work out because they 

210.26 218.60 B: [sigh] the kids y- if they had kids for one thing they would grow up [sigh] and the kids would be like well you don't both agree on a religion so why should i believe in either of them 

218.25 219.46 A: right 

218.83 230.99 B: and they that could tear apart a family and just you feel really togetherness th- when you're able to do something together especially something like religion where you're [sigh] s- once a week or whatever that you're involved together in the same thing 

230.54 238.01 A: yeah it's it's a whole nother aspect that i think a lot of people overlook they meet somebody in college or wherever [sigh] 

234.81 235.92 B: yeah 

237.72 239.03 B: yeah 

238.06 243.37 A: and it's one of those things that doesn't come up in typical conversation when you're dating or whatever [sigh] 

243.11 243.94 B: right 

243.50 247.43 A: but uh as far as down the road especially when you're talking life partner 

247.50 250.90 A: [sigh] i i agree that it's uh that it's a biggie 

247.57 249.02 B: (( yeah )) 

250.98 253.36 B: [sigh] and um i think uh [mn] 

253.66 262.11 B: knowing how many kids you want or if you want kids that's kind of important too uh uh i mean especially if if they don't want kids and you want kids but [cough] 

258.34 259.36 A: yeah 

261.41 265.70 A: yeah that would be a big a big red flag i think 

263.18 263.98 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

264.87 265.85 B: yeah 

265.83 274.25 A: um [sigh] and [noise] even along the lines of h- one person saying i d- i want one kid and another one saying i want ten kids [sigh] 

273.92 274.82 B: yeah 

274.39 283.50 A: um i think that that's something that would definitely [sigh] need to be addressed before you talk about marriage and stuff like that 

283.55 296.48 B: yeah yeah and uh it just and if you have kids if one of you wants to stay home with them [sigh] or if the other one thinks no we both should be working or you know or you can stay home but i'm not going to or 

287.48 288.34 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

296.44 310.64 B: that sort of thing and [sigh] for us we have kids but uh one of us stays home with them and it's [sigh] that's very important for me that and for m- my husband too that uh one of us stays home with them and them [sigh] and uh so that they're 

310.48 311.47 A: yeah 

310.86 317.25 B: they have that you know family or grow bringing up that type of bringing up and stuff but 

316.22 321.17 A: yeah and along those same lines is probably uh career 

321.40 323.65 A: [sigh] um if 

323.82 325.85 A: one person is going to be [sigh] 

325.85 332.46 A: the major breadwinner let's say and they're going to be traveling all the time or [sigh] um 

332.46 343.36 A: they're going to expect their spouse to cover for them if they're if they're going to work late all the time let's say or [sigh] be out of town for weeks at a time 

334.95 336.09 B: (( [cough] mhm )) 

343.47 344.34 A: (( uh )) 

343.66 344.41 B: yeah 

344.43 347.20 A: you can have incompatibility in that area too 

347.39 349.62 A: [sigh] you don't want two people that [sigh] 

348.01 348.70 B: yeah 

350.08 353.01 A: are both going to focus on their careers 

354.21 355.59 B: right 

354.37 358.71 A: all the time and then want to have kids too or something like that and that's [noise] 

358.00 372.80 B: right and and i personally think that that's just terrible if if people really have that expectation like you said they're gone all the time it's like [sigh] how can you expect anybody to really get to know you even much less ex- you know 

366.12 366.99 A: yeah 

372.57 374.59 B: have much of a family life 

374.31 375.40 A: (( yeah mhm yeah )) 

374.66 388.70 B: [sigh] if you're gone all the time i mean like w- you know we haul all weekday at twelve hours a day and some weekends and that sort of thing i mean that's just [sigh] i wouldn't want that even for you know a husband much less for a father 

389.13 391.35 A: [sigh] that's why i think it's important to uh 

391.71 392.87 A: (( [sigh] have )) 

392.97 402.26 A: a fairly not a long but [sigh] a decent engagement for a a decent length of time because these are the types of issues that [sigh] 

402.27 405.50 A: would come up af- wouldn't come up right away 

405.75 415.43 A: maybe in the first month or two but on down the road so that people can make sure that they really are compatible in all areas or almost all areas 

413.05 414.43 B: (( but yeah )) 

415.60 417.48 B: yeah and 

415.63 417.82 A: [sigh] before they walk down the aisle 

418.29 430.35 B: and i don't uh i don't know about you or whatever but i don't uh agree with people living together before they get married i think that just takes something out of the whole thing and it can cause a lot of problems or 

427.69 428.86 A: yeah 

430.17 434.93 B: a lot of times people think well why should i get married what's the difference between this and that you know 

434.20 443.91 A: yeah [sigh] i came from that same background [sigh] but i did live with my [mn] spouse for about three months b- between the time that 

441.91 446.55 B: oh [mn] [laughter] that's nothing though [laughter] 

444.01 452.91 A: i graduated and the time we got married and i mean we had been dating for a long time and we had been engaged for a while too so 

447.40 447.96 B: (( [cough] )) 

452.52 455.97 B: see well that that's different no 

453.38 458.53 A: i don't think it was that big of a deal but if definitely there definitely can be problems with that [sigh] 

458.42 469.97 B: yeah i'm talking about people just meeting and then then they say well let's live together first and it's like whatever and then they have a kid and two and three and then 

459.01 460.10 A: i would agree 

461.78 463.15 A: oh yeah and just 

463.16 465.36 A: yeah let's buy a house together and 

466.64 467.50 A: yeah 

469.96 473.88 B: then they split up because they just can't get along any more and 

472.64 475.43 A: yeah [sigh] i'm trying to think what else 

474.39 477.11 B: i think a lot of people are missing commitment 

477.21 484.75 B: you know you just hear about divorce is on the rise and if both people would really work together to [sigh] 

484.58 494.88 B: like me and my husband it's like we we know that we're in it for the long haul we're [mn] not going to look for an easy out if something happens like oh let's get a divorce you know too much too much you know [sigh] 

495.00 498.96 B: but uh i think a lot of people are just just want an easy fix 

498.51 508.65 A: mhm yeah yeah [lipsmack] yeah i think it's definitely important to be realistic coming in and [sigh] like i said at the beginning i think friendship is the most important thing [sigh] and if you're best friends you can get through 

506.09 507.11 B: yeah 

508.84 512.76 A: [sigh] anything i mean people get old and they're not going to be beautiful forever [sigh] 

512.42 514.19 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

512.92 514.05 A: um 

514.34 516.05 A: (( so if you're [sigh] )) 

516.42 526.89 A: down the road in forty years you're going to be spending time with your best friend not a twenty year old that's got a great body or whatever because [sigh] they're not going to be around forever 

526.96 527.91 B: yeah 

528.57 529.74 B: exactly 

530.74 536.03 A: so and then [sigh] the only other thing i can think of is i i would say that it would help to [sigh] 

530.90 531.75 B: so 

536.04 539.88 A: have similar v- views as far as money goes 

539.79 541.26 B: oh yeah 

540.07 542.61 A: um whether you're [sigh] 

543.20 545.93 A: uh saving i mean 'cause that's the 

546.00 554.46 A: at least from what i've read that's the number one reason for divorces or one o- one one of the number one reasons [sigh] is financial problems 

549.69 550.91 B: oh really 

554.57 563.31 A: or problems about money so i think it would help to have similar values as far as that goes [sigh] whether you want to be savers for saving for a house or 

562.79 563.94 B: yeah 

563.48 569.32 A: making sure you know who's going to pay the bills and [sigh] whether you're going to have the same checking account or 

569.56 571.36 A: (( separate checking accounts [sigh] )) 

571.45 572.69 B: (( yeah )) 

571.54 573.53 A: how all that stuff is going to work 

573.55 574.39 B: yeah 

573.67 575.60 A: definitely you you want to have a plan 

575.84 577.34 A: (( ahead of time )) 

576.04 587.85 B: and and you want to look for someone who who you got trust in i mean if [sigh] if you're afraid that he's been cheating around or she's been sleeping around on you or whatever i mean [sigh] don't go through with it anyway 

587.42 588.41 A: (( yeah mm )) 

587.62 598.36 B: just because you mailed out the invitations or because you've invested a year already or whatever or three months that some people you know it's like [sigh] uh you know they feel like they're pressured into it [sigh] 

599.19 599.89 B: (( so i think )) 

599.27 599.89 A: yeah
