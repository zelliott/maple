30.00 35.96 A: i hear that someone who's going to be with you through thick or thin no matter what happens to you down the line 

35.41 40.94 B: [noise] yeah definitely and with the line of work i do i i definitely need something like that you know 

41.38 45.10 A: i hear that i think everyone needs that though no matter what they do 

45.62 46.97 B: definitely 

47.21 48.99 B: wow and uh you know 

49.21 51.29 B: like what what do you look for in a 

51.42 63.58 A: i look for someone who has traits that i'm missing someone who can compliment what i can offer so that we're not too much alike but also yet we're not totally opposite 

63.54 68.43 A: someone who you feel comfortable with like you're meant to be with that person 

68.07 75.48 B: yeah definitely definitely that's one way to put it yeah i was trying to find the right words and then you just did it for me 

75.00 76.51 A: [laughter] 

75.84 81.39 B: [laughter] but yeah definitely that's that's definitely a cool way about going about doing things you know [sigh] 

83.64 89.39 A: so do you know anybody who's found their life partner and you think that wow how'd they pull that off 

89.39 94.13 B: uh i could actually just say i did i could actually say that 

94.58 99.51 B: i've uh i've been with my girl before we got married we were together for about six years 

100.04 103.06 B: then we uh just got recen- we recently just got married 

103.15 104.80 A: congratulations 

104.23 108.99 B: so it's like and we just recently had a baby girl so you know you just don't have a baby with just anyone 

107.27 108.25 A: [mn] 

108.94 113.16 A: i he- i hear that that's a [mn] big undertaking 

112.78 119.64 B: yeah but um besides that no one you know any- anybody i know it's like really 

119.55 129.60 B: their relationships really don't work out but then again they look for the wrong things in people they just you know they look for the outside appearance instead of the inside and how they feel 

129.41 138.04 A: exactly the outside changes over time but it's who someone is that's gonna matter and that's what you should be attracted to and b- and love 

135.62 137.00 B: (( definitely )) 

138.03 139.85 B: (( exactly mm )) 

139.10 153.38 A: take my best friend for instance his wife is my ex girlfriend's sister i set them up 'cause i knew they'd be good together she was dating another friend of mine who did her all wrong and they are perfect together i i i see them 

153.38 154.46 A: lasting 

154.66 156.23 A: unlike um 

156.81 160.31 A: who who uh the other person's with now i don't see them lasting 

161.43 166.76 A: 'cause he my uh my friend was looking for a partner not just someone to be with 

166.16 180.79 B: yeah yeah and th- then most you know most people that's what they do they they try to look for a partner but they always wind up getting you know the certain type of person that you just [mn] you can only sleep with and you know 

181.40 183.70 B: that's that's that's 

183.89 187.15 B: that's okay if you want to live your life you know 

187.55 188.95 B: like that 

187.56 193.89 A: you know you you want someone who you want to come go home to and you're having problems will make you feel better 

193.50 200.66 B: yeah you know you also have to look for someone who's you know who can be your best friend also you know 

194.54 195.43 A: [mn] 

199.98 201.67 A: exactly 

201.39 205.60 B: so that's that's really hard trait to find in a lot of people 

207.36 220.19 A: funny i was just having this conversation with uh one of my other friends he was saying how he met this woman and he has a kid but his marriage didn't work out and he's not looking to date like five different people a week 

220.01 221.81 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

220.03 223.35 A: he just wants to get into a relationship with one person 

223.75 230.43 A: and make that last and she didn't want that but she was afraid to tell him that 'cause she didn't want to hurt him 

230.93 233.13 B: well that's another thing too you know 

232.04 233.05 A: (( [mn] )) 

234.12 241.41 B: you sh- i the way i feel you should always [mn] you know express yourselves the way you feel you know just don't beat around the bush about things 

243.11 250.75 A: exactly you don't want to be in a relationship with someone who you think wants to be there with you and they don't but they're just afraid to tell you how they really feel 

250.19 253.31 B: you know yeah that's that's really not cool 

253.38 255.27 A: so how did you meet your wife 

254.89 262.90 B: actually i met her like we're in new york so and i was uh i was a messenger and i was delivering a package and i walked right by her job 

263.60 265.59 B: and we've been together ever since 

265.77 267.06 A: [noise] wow 

267.97 270.50 B: and that was seven years ago 

270.76 272.13 A: that's like fate 

272.17 279.32 B: exactly and you know it's like before i met her i just i had just gotten off of a very long relationship too 

279.47 284.75 B: so when i met her i told her all about it you know she became my best friend before she became my lover you know 

284.50 285.91 A: mhm [mn] [mn] 

285.21 287.56 B: so it all worked out you know 

287.36 292.88 A: now when you met her were you thinking that oh i don't want to meet anyone right now i have just got out of this relationship 

292.37 299.43 B: yeah that's [mn] that's the way i was thinking you know i was i was actually looking for a friend because you know most of my friends are female so 

299.95 300.82 B: you know 

301.12 304.43 B: and and i really can't talk to them about what i do 

304.34 304.90 A: (( yeah )) 

304.80 317.55 B: because they'll they'll you know they're the type of women that take things very very extremely like they'll take it to the next level [laughter] and you don't need that you need someone who's just gonna sit and listen and pass advice on to you you know 

318.14 319.28 A: [noise] 

319.53 326.59 A: i definitely hear that that's how it was with my best friend they they both uh swore they didn't want to date anyone 

326.74 329.35 A: and then a month later they were dating 

330.08 336.22 B: yeah i mean it's hard not to date you know it's you know there's a lot of a lot of attractive people out there 

333.00 334.22 A: it is hard 

335.14 345.74 A: [laughter] and you see it in the news who's dating who but then you see all the celebrities getting together getting married and then getting divorced they didn't have anything there 

345.29 347.32 B: yeah 

347.45 352.15 B: and that's definitely you don't want to you don't want to look for something like that 

353.46 357.60 B: like and i see myself with my wife you know for for forever 

358.06 359.95 B: i just love her so much 

360.18 366.75 B: you know like and she was with me when i started my career i'm a model now so she's you know she's been with me through the whole thing 

367.34 378.66 B: you know she actually got me into it so that was pretty cool and she knows she knows i'm surrounded by beautiful women everyday and she you know it doesn't bother her and that's also a trait that you have to look for you know 

378.54 380.94 A: that's right you have to be secure with what you have 

380.39 381.91 B: exactly 

382.04 383.70 B: exactly 

384.14 388.80 B: and she is pretty secure you know she knows i won't go around and fool around 

388.81 390.43 B: stuff like that 

388.85 393.39 A: maybe you may be with somebody during the day but at night you're home trapped with her 

393.00 395.73 B: exactly exactly 

395.88 399.24 B: you know and like i said we just had a beautiful baby girl 

399.89 403.70 B: you know so it's like strong relationship you know 

404.22 410.25 B: it's not like where you you know just go out and meet somebody at a club or something and then you know 

410.33 414.87 B: a week later you guys are not together anymore and you don't want to live like that 

414.81 417.89 A: i see that happen all the time 

418.25 420.69 B: mhm it's it's it's tough 

420.77 423.53 B: but then again you know you could never find the right one 

425.36 429.36 B: it's always hard to find that right you know your soul mate 

429.64 432.78 A: it is hard but it's worthwhile when you find that person 

431.85 434.12 B: oh definitely definitely 

434.88 438.58 A: then again you can't be looking if you're looking you don't find them 

437.90 441.22 B: definitely you you always wind up finding the wrong person 

443.02 447.61 B: which is you know i can't say that's bad either 'cause it'd you know it teach you a lesson 

447.03 451.05 A: [mn] it teaches who you don't want and then you know what you want to 

451.07 453.69 A: [mn] uh be with later down the line 

453.49 455.56 B: exactly 

455.58 458.02 B: i mean it's cool being in a relationship you know 

458.07 461.93 B: it's like i ju- i don't like being alone you know so 

462.47 464.65 B: i'm like one of those people [laughter] 

464.25 468.02 A: [laughter] i hear that i won't go to the movies by myself i 

468.25 471.11 A: won't go to a concert by myself 

471.61 475.14 A: especially when you see everyone around with somebody and then it gets you down 

474.71 477.09 B: yeah always you know [laughter] 

477.39 483.57 B: at least i know you know i you know i see couples walking down the street holding hands i always think of my wife you know 

481.67 485.51 A: oh that's so cute exactly 

484.58 486.86 B: so i'm like damn what is she doing now 

486.94 489.06 A: is she thinking about me 

488.41 491.75 B: yeah it's like you know like just like we first met you know 

492.17 500.39 B: it's like that's one thing that never changes you know if you find that right someone everytime you think about them it's like wow we just met 

503.44 504.66 A: (( yeah )) 

504.49 506.81 B: (( yeah its all good )) 

506.85 508.75 B: and when it comes down to it you know 

509.55 517.82 B: some people are kind of shady you know like you said you know they don't want to tell you you know you have to find out the hard way and stuff like that 

517.62 522.53 A: and they also don't want to tell you who they are they act like they're somebody else 'cause that's what they think 

521.97 523.29 B: yeah 

522.71 526.62 A: you want and sometimes they don't know [mn] themselves what they are 

527.04 535.43 B: exactly and when you find that out you know sometimes you don't want to point that out 'cause you don't want to lose that someone and you know [mn] a lot of things 

536.15 542.66 B: but then again it's just you know the small things that would let you know what [mn] you know what a whole person is and what they're like you 

544.20 545.54 B: (( know so )) 

545.73 556.55 B: it's like uh you know like me and my wife take you know take me and my wife for instance like you know i i never let her cook you know i always do the cooking 'cause that's me i like to cook i like to be in the kitchen you 

557.69 564.39 B: know she doesn't you know she doesn't mind sometimes it bothers her so she lets me know you know 

564.49 567.27 A: and then you let her cook or you take her out to dinner [laughter] 

566.73 571.78 B: yeah basically well i can't let her cook 'cause she doesn't know how to cook [laughter] 

570.59 574.03 A: [laughter] well that's why you got to teach her how to cook 

573.74 576.97 B: yeah she doesn't want to learn either so she you know [mn] 

577.04 587.58 B: she's always s- says i'm such a good cook and why should i learn how to cook if you know how to cook and you're such a good cook and i'm like hey it doesn't bother me as long as i make you happy 

588.80 591.98 A: that's the important thing making everybody happy 

591.19 593.29 B: mhm 

593.50 594.61 B: but uh
