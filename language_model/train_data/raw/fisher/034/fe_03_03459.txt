0.00 1.38 A: richard mellor 

1.31 4.34 B: hi my name is tina holmes 

5.08 6.32 B: hi richard 

6.08 7.55 A: hi how you doing 

7.29 10.09 B: okay i've never done this before have you 

9.25 12.38 A: no me neither this is my first time too it's kind a 

12.40 16.16 A: kind a weird i was just you know registering on the computer and stuff but uh 

15.80 17.58 B: yeah where do you live 

17.43 18.86 A: uh philadelphia 

18.69 21.26 B: oh uh-huh i live in new york city 

20.88 22.64 A: do you that's cool 

22.46 26.97 B: yeah so what do you think the most important thing to look for is in a life partner 

26.82 28.80 A: yeah i think it's someone who uh 

29.42 33.12 A: who you get along with and you have uh you can 

33.14 35.85 A: work towards your goals together and you can have fun 

36.33 40.41 B: mhm i i would say communication 

41.25 42.12 B: (( um )) 

42.13 44.05 B: very important um 

44.17 45.44 B: (( um [mn] )) 

45.46 50.36 B: you know [mn] someone you [laughter] feel attracted to on a lot of different levels um 

50.58 55.16 B: someone you feel love [laughter] for i don't know it's hard to say what the most important thing is 

54.39 57.90 A: i know it is hard to put a finger on it it's like this whole field of uh 

58.17 60.52 A: field of ranges you know and 

59.91 69.57 B: yeah yeah i um i guess someone you share interests with i i don't know but that could just be a friend you know 

69.53 72.24 A: oh that's a good point i didn't even consider that 

71.68 76.94 B: yeah yeah are are they taping [laughter] us they must be taping 

76.08 78.11 A: yeah yeah we're being recorded i believe 

77.34 79.00 B: okay yeah okay 

78.69 84.39 A: um yeah i don't know i'm also thinking like [mn] well i was thinking like the whole spectrum you know you 

84.83 86.10 A: you have um 

86.86 90.91 A: you know you have interests together you actually enjoy doing fun things together 

90.98 92.36 B: mhm 

91.18 96.12 A: um you know because once you achieve all your financial goals if you don't have any interest in the person 

96.88 98.80 A: it's pretty boring 

98.39 100.76 B: yeah yeah i mean i 

100.83 105.27 B: i don't know um i think having things in common is important 

105.94 111.22 B: um you know shared interests like you said things you like you both like doing 

111.27 112.46 B: um 

112.04 119.00 A: yeah i think i mean i think if you have that everything else pretty much falls into place you'll be communicating about things you both care about and 

118.62 123.95 B: i don't know i guess you could have shared interests but not be very communicative [laughter] about them 

123.10 125.48 A: you think yeah i guess that's a possibility 

124.66 129.76 B: i mean it depends on you know um personality types uh 

130.06 132.22 B: i don't know i mean 

133.28 138.57 B: to me i i guess like having had a life partner who did not work out 

137.94 139.09 A: right 

138.51 151.65 B: um i i would say um someone who's working on hi- him his personal growth and you know wanting [mn] wanting to put some energy into the [laughter] relationship and 

150.86 152.15 A: that makes sense 

152.20 157.04 B: uh 'cause i think those are important qualities um 

157.16 168.57 B: [lipsmack] it's really it's hm i'm trying to think of r- relationships [mn] that that are you know m- more like a life partner relationship rather than a friend 

168.53 170.02 A: right 

169.63 174.77 B: um because i think there has to be that kind of chemistry between you and a life partner 

174.96 178.20 B: there has to be some sort of i guess sexual attraction 

177.87 178.93 A: i'd say 

178.47 190.85 B: which would which is not something in [mn] you know [mn] of course i think there has to be a friendship but a life partner then there has to be that sexual attraction unless you're going to be celibate with your life [laughter] partner 

190.86 195.14 A: yeah i don't know celibate and life partner i don't i i think there's got to be sex 

195.06 198.02 B: well i guess there are those people that um 

198.23 202.17 B: have celibate relationships but i i i guess 

201.55 204.92 A: yeah but i mean you know i mean if you take two healthy people 

204.47 206.06 B: yeah yeah 

205.16 208.51 A: [laughter] your chances of celibacy go way down 

208.29 211.76 B: yeah yeah i mean maybe if they were elderly or something 

211.77 212.98 A: yeah 

212.37 214.51 B: but i don't know about [laughter] 

213.94 217.16 A: they got to be compatible on that level too i'd imagine 

216.72 222.21 B: i would i would say yeah i i think it's good to have a a friendship 

223.15 225.25 B: you know to start off with 

225.49 230.09 B: you know and and a- an a- an a- an attraction to each other 

230.69 236.24 B: you know like it like to have things in common but also be physically attracted to each other 

237.17 242.42 B: i mean if you have nothing in common with the other person i don't know if you're going to be wanting to you 

242.64 244.53 B: know engage with them 

244.22 245.49 A: yeah 

245.74 249.64 B: [mn] you know what i'm saying i i know they say opposites attract but 

250.35 254.86 B: someone's i i don't know sometimes i guess that's true what do you think 

254.13 257.02 A: um it's ha- it's ha it's happened to me a couple of times uh 

256.68 258.25 B: yeah opposites 

257.80 263.98 A: yeah someone completely opposite it's it's i don't know but then you you do have to have that tying common interest [mn] 

263.85 267.43 B: yeah how did it work out with those people who are very opposite 

266.13 268.64 A: oh no it still bombed but you know it 

268.74 271.23 A: i mean it wasn't life partner type uh 

270.88 272.20 B: yeah 

271.60 277.34 A: type commitment or anything but and there's another word you know commitment i think we need that 

277.00 280.38 B: yeah [mn] it would have to be committed to the relationship 

277.69 278.85 A: (( you know [mn] )) 

279.91 281.21 A: definitely 

281.26 284.43 B: yeah let's um 

284.55 287.19 B: [lipsmack] it's most important quality 

286.59 289.30 A: i mean especially at the life partner level 

289.39 290.51 B: yeah 

289.82 294.35 A: because if you're committed you'll you'll probably do the things that are necessary to keep it going 

294.35 298.81 B: yeah yeah a commitment to the relationship is important 

299.11 301.34 B: yeah i think that is um 

302.02 309.27 B: [lipsmack] that they both have to have those qual- be committed 'cause sometimes one person can be [laughter] committed and the other person isn't 

309.02 310.69 A: yeah 

309.73 317.03 B: so it has to be sort of an equal level of commitment i think [mn] i don't know if it ever can be like totally fifty fifty 

317.84 319.68 A: yeah i don't i don't know i mean 

319.75 321.52 A: i i don't know how that works 

322.15 328.83 A: i mean somebody told me once you know if you're only given if you you know if you think you're giving fifty percent you know you're probably only giving about ten 

329.06 331.53 A: i don't know how true that is or not but 

330.98 332.03 B: (( no )) 

332.30 337.27 B: you tend to be um the one that is doing more giving in the relationship or less 

337.35 338.56 A: who me 

337.96 338.86 B: yeah 

338.71 340.70 A: i don't know probably more giving 

340.37 342.26 B: uh-huh yeah 

341.87 343.74 A: i i don't know though i mean 

344.98 347.44 A: i'm you know i i think about it and i'm like 

347.54 353.29 A: you know i i don't know like i think if you're like at the point where you're keeping track of how much you're giving 

353.45 356.89 A: you know like i i i don't think you can truly be in love until 

357.74 359.14 A: until you um 

359.24 364.90 A: oh what's the phrase until you you stop keeping track of rights and wrongs and 

364.44 365.97 B: (( scorekeeping yeah )) 

365.48 373.73 A: yeah you know once you once you get past the scorekeeping thing things aren't bad that's like what you do on your fifth or sixth date you know you start keeping track [laughter] you know 

371.94 372.94 B: uh-huh 

373.29 385.12 B: i'm wondering if they are asking um you know what's the most important quality for you to have in a life partner like if i made my list or just in general 

385.33 386.42 A: i don't know 

386.41 387.38 B: what w- 

387.41 388.17 B: (( [mn] 'cause )) 

387.61 393.12 A: i i don't think they're that specific i think they're probably studying the interaction or something but uh 

393.21 395.33 A: (( yeah um i don't know )) 

396.19 408.42 B: yeah because like i i guess i would have to say somebody who's like working on himself and trying to grow and you know that kind of thing but that might not be important to everybody 

408.30 417.41 A: well you know they're they're only concerned about what you want i think you know plus you can't be concerned ab- i mean you really can't trouble yourself with wondering what everybody else in the world wants 

411.46 412.78 B: mm yeah i 

417.26 429.37 B: yeah yeah well that would be i i would i would find that important i like people who are interested in spiritual things and you know [mn] [laughter] all that working [mn] 

428.31 431.54 A: like like what kind of spiritual things if you don't mind me asking 

430.95 432.06 B: um 

432.34 438.10 B: well just have a spiritual path um it would be whatever that means to them 

438.16 443.55 B: although i i guess i wouldn't like someone who was in some kind of cult or [laughter] something but 

442.29 447.42 A: right but spiritual things are okay like as long as they're not in a cult 

445.28 446.27 B: yeah 

446.88 451.45 B: or somebody who's very very extreme in their spiritual path like a 

451.52 461.51 B: you know very extreme religion that's very like judgemental or something like that but somebody who has interest in a spiritual life is important to me 

461.21 462.08 A: (( i see )) 

462.68 464.43 B: is that important to you or not 

464.19 466.06 A: uh not terribly so 

465.49 468.90 B: no you're not that oriented in that area 

468.34 474.72 A: well i just you know i mean it's not well no i'm not religious actually it's absolutely not important to me 

471.89 472.85 B: mhm 

474.71 482.03 B: i'm not re- exactly religious it's more like spiritual you know it's different like i don't belong to a church or anything 

482.34 493.38 A: yeah well you kn- you know for me like and th- and this would sound bad and i don't want to like offend you or anything like someone who is like into the spiritual but not like really [mn] well i mean i figure if you're gong to do something do it 

487.36 488.46 B: yeah 

493.59 502.89 A: you know what i mean so like like i i have a respect for like your fundamental christians or your fundamental muslims or even you know your hindus just because they go all out 

499.64 500.93 B: mhm 

502.80 504.12 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

503.34 509.02 A: you know what i mean like well most most of the time when i hear spiritual i'm hearing someone who like dabbles 

509.09 513.72 B: oh i don't dabble i actually have a particular spiritual path but um 

511.94 512.80 A: (( you know )) 

513.28 517.89 A: i mean even [mn] even your hard corp i mean as long as you know get into it you know what i mean 

515.93 519.94 B: [laughter] yeah yeah i know what you mean 

519.58 526.75 A: i mean there's just so many people that are like you know so half hearted into things and i'm like you know if you're gonna do it go all out or don't go at all you know it's just 

526.00 538.22 B: yeah well that's actually probably not something that's that important to you from the sound of it but you you you place more emphasis on having fun shared interests and that sort of thing 

531.07 531.97 A: right 

537.55 539.84 A: and the intellectual yes i mean 

539.30 542.30 B: intellectual well you know like 

542.31 545.44 B: th- is that [mn] do you mean by that shared interests 

545.52 549.33 A: well not only that but i mean a person doesn't have to be 

549.40 555.04 A: the exact same interest you know because you can always find somebody to talk about your interest with 

551.07 552.02 B: uh-huh 

554.85 555.93 B: right 

555.64 563.25 A: but like you know for example i enjoy chemistry quite a bit but you know i wouldn't expect my life partner to be a chemist 

562.74 563.71 B: uh-huh 

563.34 569.49 A: um you know like you can always go to the lab or something like that and [laughter] find somebody to talk about what you're in you know 

568.16 569.22 B: yeah 

569.23 570.13 B: right 

569.94 577.54 A: but you you'd like somebody who's intelligent enough given the time that they could understand it if it was important to you and you needed to talk to them about it 

577.33 579.97 B: right to take an interest in it 

579.33 583.32 A: i mean y- you just can't [mn] i i can't be with an airhead it just wouldn't work 

582.75 586.40 B: yeah are you into chem- uh do you work in chemistry 

586.10 589.24 A: um no not right now i'm going to school for it but uh 

588.66 591.20 B: oh you're going to school oh 

591.55 598.37 B: yeah well i think yeah th- uh that's true you have to have someone who is your intellectual equal i would think 

598.42 599.95 A: yeah yeah or even superior would work
