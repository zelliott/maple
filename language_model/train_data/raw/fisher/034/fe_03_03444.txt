10.98 12.34 B: (( uh yep )) 

11.79 14.30 A: [laughter] very interesting topic 

14.39 16.00 B: uh yeah [laughter] 

15.28 16.80 A: what are your thoughts 

16.53 20.58 B: uh well uh i think that the most important thing is 

20.75 27.09 B: uh that you pick someone who understands you and uh 

27.29 28.91 A: (( compatibility )) 

27.57 28.13 B: (( [mn] )) 

28.39 31.47 B: compatibility yeah what about you 

29.39 30.74 A: mhm 

31.46 32.63 A: honesty 

33.09 34.10 B: um 

33.13 38.08 A: hones- honesty is um something that um 

38.17 43.02 A: i know um it goes a far away full disclosure 

43.47 45.88 A: and also um 

45.92 53.80 A: for someone that is going to you know keep you abreast of uh events 

53.83 55.61 A: and someone that 

56.51 59.86 A: [mn] are not going to can you hold a second please 

59.50 60.22 B: (( mm )) 

68.41 68.97 B: (( [mn] )) 

70.24 80.28 A: [noise] i'm back okay yes i think honesty's very important and caring is another very important thing because a lot of people get carried away 

70.98 72.11 B: (( all right )) 

80.49 84.81 A: with um paying attention to finances only 

84.84 90.17 A: (( and the element of caring the element of love is missing )) 

90.62 100.80 A: so um i think those are some of the things um their background is also very very it's critical 

101.70 104.78 B: uh yep i agree i guess um 

104.79 119.45 B: well i think not so much about the background but uh i definitely think that you the caring is important and uh i guess i can understand you know it's important to have a a certain level of understanding 

119.08 120.06 A: yes 

119.74 130.66 B: uh that's definitely true but i mean i i know plenty of people in uh relationships that have you know come from very different backgrounds and in all those ca- i mean in 

130.69 135.35 B: those cases it's worked out well so i think that um 

132.51 133.47 A: yes 

136.81 138.05 B: uh 

138.17 139.53 B: yeah i i would say 

140.19 144.88 B: still the understanding wha- what what else about this topics are we supposed to discuss did they say 

144.24 150.00 A: well um you know some of them the major elements for choosing a life partner 

149.54 150.47 B: uh-huh 

150.47 152.95 A: is um is the topic 

153.31 155.17 B: right 

153.38 154.97 A: (( and um [lipsmack] )) 

155.80 156.77 B: uh 

155.83 157.51 A: i believe um 

157.65 162.54 A: some of the the items that um in choosing a life partner 

162.71 167.65 A: is why why why i spoke to the background it's 

166.49 167.91 B: mhm 

167.83 174.26 A: when um you have people not everybody but in general terms a lot of people are 

174.38 181.36 A: (( um insufficiently exposed they sometimes their their behaviour )) 

181.85 186.78 A: is um a little bit indifferent from those who 

186.89 191.91 A: have had an opportunity to either be in a 

192.06 193.41 A: um 

194.79 196.72 A: two parent also 

197.13 200.97 A: or um have had an opportunity to 

197.59 198.48 B: mhm 

201.04 205.74 A: see a number of things in life that um 

206.16 209.78 A: would take them across geographical borders 

209.90 214.52 A: would also and and to understand the wider community 

214.63 217.65 A: um in a you know in addition to 

217.85 221.30 A: the relate to the wider community 

221.36 228.54 A: um so exposure plays a a very very important part and one um 

228.84 232.83 A: a person's ideal what are they looking for 

232.10 234.77 B: that's very true i definitely agree with that 

233.10 235.79 A: you know in a relationship 

235.21 236.91 B: mhm 

235.85 237.75 A: you know because um 

238.00 245.29 A: a lot of people are there uh [mn] there are a lot of myths th- they may look for 

245.39 252.02 A: some people are just really looking for they're not looking beyond the companionship 

251.39 253.27 B: mhm 

252.29 257.46 A: and some misunderstand or element of companionship also 

256.89 258.09 B: true true 

258.11 261.34 A: so um the it i think 

261.38 265.48 A: [lipsmack] a number of major ground rules should be set 

265.67 277.56 B: yeah i g- um well what i was i guess what i've um i guess when i started when i first heard the topic what i kind of thought of was what i individually was looking for i guess you know but i think 

277.67 285.53 B: um if the topic were extend to what you know people should look for in a life partner i think it's a certain compatibility of ideals 

285.54 290.84 B: um and goals and maybe even uh history 

290.21 294.58 A: you just hit a good point goals similarities and goals 

292.31 293.49 B: mhm 

294.12 297.85 B: yeah because i mean when you i mean 

298.29 302.93 B: when you commit your life to someone you know you should have like similar 

303.34 304.44 B: (( uh )) 

305.11 313.87 B: i mean financial goals of course but also you know goals for the future kids [mn] i think that's a problem with a lot of couples you know if they have differing ideas on 

313.99 316.12 B: uh how many kids 

314.62 317.19 A: yeah economically and socially 

316.64 319.71 B: yeah well how many ki- i was thinking more along the lines of you know 

319.82 325.63 B: kids like how many kids they want to have if they want to have kids i know that's always a a common 

322.58 323.57 A: right 

325.97 331.21 B: i don't know if it's a friction well yeah common source of friction between new couples at least 

330.58 331.73 A: yes 

331.95 333.24 B: um 

333.63 339.90 B: and i think that also maybe that something that's more recent than uh i mean that may be more of an issue now than it was 

339.98 341.72 A: before yes 

339.99 343.34 B: uh before i mean [mn] you know uh 

343.53 346.08 B: i think that um 

347.81 353.19 B: [lipsmack] uh hold on one second just that more you know 

354.04 367.73 B: women are more career oriented these days which is good um but i mean it does create a certain amount of i think some people may grow up with the idea that they're going to you know have a relationship and be in one one's 

367.75 379.59 B: like in one way but then you know grow up i mean and then it turns out that really they'll get something different because their idea of what a nuclear family is is based on what their parents had which 

379.77 383.42 B: [mn] probably most people these days will have something quite different 

382.82 386.11 A: yes [mn] because of the whole liberalization 

386.62 388.85 B: uh yeah 

389.97 391.05 B: um 

390.18 390.74 A: (( [mn] )) 

392.01 399.77 B: [lipsmack] but i i don't know i at the same time i mean my my mother worked full time so i don't think that um 

399.56 407.45 B: it's harder for me to say but i i do notice i think that that's made me notice the the that i talked about in other people more so 

407.39 408.39 A: right 

408.70 411.13 A: we we we have um 

408.79 409.70 B: (( um )) 

411.17 416.79 A: we have a v- a very um a society that is built now on 

417.08 426.19 A: a lot of fabrication in terms of um what are the ideal situation in choosing 

426.43 428.71 B: yeah i think that's definitely true 

426.54 431.32 A: that that they look at so mu- so you know so everything is cosmetic 

431.13 434.28 B: yeah and also i mean there is also a certain 

434.33 443.54 B: well there's a duality to the media's presentation on this i mean on one sense you watch the movies and you see you know oh you know there's real people should 

443.81 453.09 B: have this weird quirky you know love connection with someone but then you also see the very crass media treatment of things like that [mn] in you know 

452.96 465.22 B: the reality tel- television and things like that where they say oh you know as long as you just set up people in the right situation they could theoretically become life partners and i think that that's i think that's interesting because 

465.25 469.01 B: i think the truth is far away from both of [laughter] those things so 

470.24 472.25 A: yes no real values 

471.83 475.49 B: mhm 

473.04 474.54 A: you know it's it's 

474.59 476.76 A: it's all put together by the media 

476.50 478.47 B: yeah 

477.89 479.72 A: which is very unfortunate 

479.69 480.51 B: true 

480.48 482.31 A: (( very very unfortunate )) 

483.20 485.44 B: mhm [lipsmack] um 

486.86 491.78 A: we have to go back to the days when our parents and grandparents 

492.00 493.30 A: um 

493.53 497.79 A: you know they taught us to look for certain elements 

498.55 499.36 A: (( um )) 

498.60 502.53 B: i mean i think that that does stick with you because i mean i think that uh 

503.29 507.01 B: i'm conscious definitely of um 

507.36 507.92 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

509.08 515.80 B: oh what was it i'm conscious of you know certain values that were instilled into me by my parents and my grandparents when i'm 

515.93 516.73 B: (( you know )) 

516.95 518.38 B: dating someone 

520.66 523.58 B: (( um yeah )) 

522.19 527.05 A: yeah because uh there are a lot of signs [cough] sorry 

528.42 532.86 A: that one can see in at the outset 

533.17 540.48 A: i think um [lipsmack] sometimes um some of these things are clouded by the um 

540.89 542.99 A: you know uh 

543.64 545.22 A: [mn] some affection 

545.28 546.64 B: mhm 

545.38 547.63 A: (( but as soon as um )) 

548.16 556.24 A: that uh period the initial period wears off then you you you see what the person's really made of 

551.12 552.82 B: mhm 

557.50 560.48 A: so we have to be very very careful 

560.56 562.44 A: in not um 

562.47 567.49 A: trying in in not allowing a number of things to cloud our eyes 

567.39 568.18 B: (( [lipsmack] mhm )) 

568.64 570.19 A: so that uh 

569.37 570.98 B: oh uh one second 

572.68 575.22 A: to cloud our eyes so that we 

572.76 573.51 B: right 

575.50 581.88 A: um somewhat are you know blinded um from the reality of the situation 

580.21 581.98 B: mhm 

583.41 586.28 B: [lipsmack] yeah um 

587.11 588.10 B: so 

589.64 599.89 B: i mean i guess i i'd say that the most important thing there is that um so i guess i mean one interesting issue that i think is brought up here is that you know i mentioned that
