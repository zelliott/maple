123.70 124.56 B: (( um )) 

125.38 126.49 B: well 

126.90 130.44 B: some people don't believe in organized religion 

130.54 135.50 B: and some people were born into different religions 

136.51 137.57 B: so 

138.64 142.92 B: they just maybe just don't read the bible but they still believe in god 

143.08 143.99 A: (( okay )) 

143.84 145.67 B: actually i've read the whole bible 

146.61 148.95 A: well you've done better than me 

148.33 151.01 B: [laughter] yeah 

151.66 153.78 A: i have not read the whole bible yet 

154.51 160.13 B: um i sorta read it like i would read any any other book you know just a little bit every day 

160.58 161.74 A: well that's great 

161.55 162.48 B: yeah 

162.55 166.70 A: that's great i try to read a little bit every day myself which doesn't always work but 

168.09 170.80 A: i wake up every morning wanting to and 

171.43 173.82 B: yes you've just gotta make it a habit i guess 

176.69 177.90 A: um 

178.41 181.08 A: i don't know what else can we talk about a life partner 

181.38 182.92 A: i guess it is difficult 

183.37 186.81 A: it's kinda a difficult subject for you not having a a husband 

187.12 189.06 B: yeah um 

189.10 190.50 A: it it really 

190.67 194.19 A: it once you get married and one day you will 

194.10 194.91 B: uh-huh 

194.70 195.55 A: it's 

195.85 198.09 A: it's very different than even 

198.75 201.53 A: you know the best relationship you could ever think 

202.06 204.36 A: you know that you had in the past 

202.32 203.21 B: well 

203.78 205.56 B: was she your first wife 

205.79 206.67 A: yes 

207.33 209.00 B: was she your first love 

210.05 211.07 A: no 

211.73 215.46 A: no i i i don't i don't think so but 

216.59 219.01 A: again being a christian has 

221.71 228.40 A: it's it's a different love than i've ever ever experienced before so in in my opinion this is true love 

229.12 233.06 B: okay 'cause i sort of have a problem um like 

233.70 237.18 B: i sort of found the love of my life but 

238.31 243.93 B: um we've sort of star crossed [laughter] so i don't think i'm gonna end up marrying him 

244.19 247.94 A: star what what does that mean star crossed 

244.20 245.10 B: so 

245.96 251.00 B: star crossed meaning like we're just i don't know we're doomed or something 

251.55 252.88 B: and um 

254.62 257.62 B: i don't think i'm gonna end up marrying him and i was just wondering 

259.23 260.17 B: (( you know )) 

260.62 262.37 B: is it i guess 

262.90 264.61 B: like is it possible 

266.08 271.58 B: i don't know [laughter] is it possible to like meet someone and love them like that i guess 

273.54 275.91 B: it is something i wonder about personally 

276.66 278.11 A: most definitely 

278.77 279.77 A: um 

280.80 285.31 A: [lipsmack] and again i have to i have to keep bringing god into this because 

286.23 287.35 A: he 

289.13 292.55 A: it's it's a completely different love i feel you know i 

293.28 298.74 A: my wife much more than i always dreamt about true love and i'm a guy i never 

299.16 303.95 A: thought about true love you know i just went about my daily day and 

304.09 308.89 A: you know whatever you know you met someone and you dated and 

308.96 311.10 A: however it went it went you know 

311.46 318.56 A: um but i have to say even when i was uh i first fell in love with a girl when i was nineteen 

318.38 319.22 B: mhm 

318.67 329.73 A: and i mean i was head over heels uh you know i didn't think of anything i mean there was never any other woman in my life until my wife came along 

330.14 332.16 A: that compared to that 

331.57 332.44 B: uh-huh 

333.47 334.69 A: but again 

335.51 337.21 A: with my wife 

337.27 344.02 A: and having god intertwined in our relationship 

345.21 346.73 A: it was 

346.97 350.50 A: so much more fulfilling and 

351.02 354.96 A: i really believe that i that is when i found true love 

355.47 358.21 A: i i don't believe i ever had true love before that 

358.32 363.60 A: even with the girl when i was nineteen years old and i didn't think i could ever love anyone like i loved her 

363.34 365.26 B: mhm wow 

364.26 367.91 A: but i was a kid i was a kid i was only nineteen 

367.69 368.67 B: mhm 

368.90 375.68 A: um not that you can't be nineteen and find true love i think you can 

375.90 376.68 B: (( yes )) 

376.00 378.43 A: i don't necessarily think the age 

378.74 381.38 A: has anything to do with it um 

383.66 384.88 A: [lipsmack] and that's 

385.63 387.51 A: that's how i i see it i 

387.74 391.22 A: i guess so i guess for me what i'm saying is i i don't 

391.25 395.27 A: without god i don't think i still could've found true love [lipsmack] 

395.70 398.34 B: oh okay well where did you guys meet 

399.63 401.42 A: we actually 

401.61 413.91 A: went we we grew up in different towns but the town she grew up in was a very small town and the town i grew up in was a larger town that completely surrounded that town so we went to the same high school 

411.29 412.11 B: mhm 

414.04 417.36 A: but we didn't know one another 'cause it was a pretty big high school 

417.06 417.98 B: (( mhm [cough] )) 

418.42 421.35 A: and oh probably 

422.86 430.34 A: ten years after we graduated high school we met through a mutual friend and when i met her 

430.76 432.60 A: i knew i wanted to marry her 

432.94 436.08 A: but she was already a christian and she had something 

436.47 440.79 A: that no other girl that i'd ever met before had 

440.85 443.71 A: and we were friends for many years 

443.92 450.92 A: and then we started to date and after we were dating for a little over a year we got married 

452.23 453.31 B: okay 

455.37 458.68 B: it's nice to talk to people who believe in love like that 

459.91 461.14 B: i don't really have 

461.20 462.68 B: very much support 

463.26 464.83 B: from the people that i know 

465.32 467.62 A: you you don't have what support 

467.35 471.25 B: [lipsmack] i don't have really very much support from the people around me 

471.31 473.38 A: well that's too bad 

473.37 476.79 B: yeah they think that you should just find someone convenient 

477.63 478.88 B: (( [cough] like )) 

479.46 480.65 B: um 

480.69 482.78 B: they don't really believe in struggling 

484.46 485.67 A: oh no 

485.74 487.17 A: no don't settle 

487.03 488.50 B: (( [laughter] )) 

488.50 490.53 A: no don't settle i 

490.67 499.32 A: well as i said i'm forty one and we've only been we've been married for just five years in april we were just married five years so we both got married got late you

505.05 505.82 A: it 

506.23 507.00 A: what 

508.07 512.94 A: (( am i trying to say we we waited and i you know even though my wife )) 

513.34 515.67 A: she was a christian for many years 

516.07 520.22 A: and she knew because she had gotten her life 

520.57 525.18 A: she knew of the man she was waiting for me 

525.66 531.98 A: i did not have god in my life and i was just running around you know doing whatever i was doing 

533.10 541.59 A: i i didn't get married because i just didn't i was too selfish i didn't wanna get married i was still running around 

540.96 541.87 B: (( [cough] mhm ))
