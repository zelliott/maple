0.01 1.82 A: [sigh] hi this is greg 

1.58 3.52 B: hey greg i'm tom how are you 

3.13 4.73 A: tom what's going on [sigh] 

4.13 6.35 B: uh not a whole whale of a lot [laughter] 

6.06 9.43 A: so what do you think is the most important thing when choosing a life partner [laughter] 

8.76 13.33 B: oh so you want me to start huh [sigh] um [sigh] i guess 

13.89 25.80 B: you know you want to look for somebody that's gonna [sigh] you know be accepting of the way you think and that you know that you're you're able to accept how they think i think that's what it comes down to i don't think that [sigh] you know you're gonna find anybody out there who 

25.68 29.10 B: [sigh] is exactly like you you just need to find somebody who can accept you 

28.85 30.52 A: oh absolutely 

29.16 37.44 B: and and and what you and what you believe and what you think you know otherwise i guess you know the fifty percent divorce rate i guess that's the troubles people run into [sigh] 

37.21 44.26 A: [sigh] yeah i think a big part of that too is not only do you need to find somebody that uh can accept the way you are [sigh] but also challenge you 

44.39 45.33 B: mhm 

44.44 47.75 A: [sigh] you know and not just blindly say oh that's the way you are that's fine 

47.76 55.43 A: but actually like play devil's advocate sometimes and make you really understand why you believe the way you believe or [sigh] you know why you act the way you act [sigh] [cough] 

55.27 58.80 B: mhm [noise] [laughter] so do you oh i'm sorry go ahead 

56.33 57.26 A: (( now to it's )) 

58.19 59.22 A: please go ahead 

58.92 70.98 B: [sigh] no i was going to say so are you are you a believer that that people can be changed in a in a positive way or do you think that [sigh] you know once you get into something that really [sigh] you you can maybe challenge that person but they they're not going to change ultimately 

70.79 75.76 A: [sigh] well it's not really a matter of changing it's a matter of uh being sure 

73.31 74.13 B: uh-huh 

75.70 76.73 B: mhm 

76.14 80.83 A: uh like for instance um [lipsmack] i found my life partner when i was driving a cab 

80.92 85.15 A: she just happened to get in the car and we hit it off and history was made 

81.01 81.96 B: huh 

85.27 94.39 A: [sigh] and i'll come at her with uh something that i just read or just you know something that i was you know studying or whatever [sigh] and uh sh- you know i'll come at her you know pretty 

91.22 92.10 B: mhm 

94.44 102.45 A: you know confident about it and she will kind of tear it apart [sigh] and not in a not in a mean way but you know just trying to find the things that maybe i hadn't thought of 

98.03 99.41 B: [laughter] 

102.06 103.18 B: right 

102.66 105.49 A: and it's not really a matter of trying to change somebody but just [sigh] 

105.54 109.88 A: you know i think we all fall into those habits of [lipsmack] um 

110.16 111.11 A: [lipsmack] you know 

111.29 114.00 A: [mn] just kind of going with something maybe 

113.68 114.68 B: mhm 

114.08 122.64 A: or finding what you like and thinking that that's the end of it and going with that [sigh] and then having somebody around that will you know kind of play the dark side for a minute 

117.97 118.98 B: mhm 

122.59 123.44 B: true 

122.67 127.02 A: [sigh] and and not be in a negative way but just to like expand your own mind [sigh] 

126.71 127.89 B: exactly 

127.36 133.57 A: yeah i do the same thing for her you know she comes at me with stuff and i'll [sigh] i'll try to find the other stuff too and lay that back on her 

133.42 143.35 B: right and i and i think that's a good i think that helps you get through situations where [sigh] you might only be looking at one side of something even if she's not coming at it and tearing it apart saying [sigh] well did you really think about it this way and i think that's 

143.13 156.45 B: you know anybody can do that for you not only a life partner but i think that's important when you're [sigh] when you're making joint decisions to get somebody who's not just saying [sigh] well yeah yeah yeah whatever you want to do that's fine you know i don't want to interfere with you that they say well you know maybe maybe you just think about this [sigh] 

155.97 157.62 A: mhm mhm 

156.56 159.34 B: um so you are you are you married 

158.93 160.50 A: yes we are married 

160.04 163.88 B: okay good so like and you met in cab what what's were you what city were you in 

160.61 161.63 A: (( it it's )) 

163.45 165.14 A: uh west palm beach florida 

164.84 167.93 B: oh that's that's a really interesting way of meeting actually 

167.28 170.10 A: [sigh] last thing i thought was going to happen that night 

169.18 171.66 B: [laughter] [sigh] that's funny 

171.19 183.49 A: it was one of those dead nights when there was actually a tropical storm going on that night [cough] and i was one of four cabs out and she kept calling [sigh] and nobody would nobody'd go pick her up so finally i said screw it i'll go get her [sigh] and um 

174.17 176.80 B: (( hm )) 

178.48 179.34 B: uh-huh 

182.04 183.00 B: right 

184.07 198.69 A: [sigh] yeah and i picked her up from where she was working and i didn't even get her name but i called back where she where i picked her up from [sigh] and left a message that um i was her cab driver from last night [sigh] i'd really like to talk to her again and i'm not a creep [cough] 

198.56 199.89 B: (( mhm [noise] right right )) 

199.40 202.78 A: it worked and she called me back and we've been happy ever since 

202.69 204.92 B: that's amazing that's an interesting story 

204.41 205.60 A: [laughter] 

205.54 208.89 B: and uh well before you guys got married do you get the sense that [sigh] 

208.84 220.75 B: um you know i'm not married so i'm just asking i'm talking to a married guy here you know about his opinion [sigh] um did you get the sense that you guys had that kind of [sigh] communication where you you know she could differ on something from you or [sigh] 

220.65 227.09 B: you know was that something you went in knowing full well that this is the way she was and and that's how things were between you 

226.84 236.05 A: well it's actually something i saw develop in her as we you know kind of moved along [sigh] uh i'm eight years older than she is and i met her when she was nineteen 

229.44 230.33 B: mhm 

235.73 236.64 B: uh-huh 

236.09 238.99 A: so she was still in the party girl phase you know 

238.67 239.49 B: right 

239.16 249.58 A: [sigh] um not sure where she was going to [sigh] end up or you know devote her life to or anything [sigh] and then like you know just like that night i knew that she was something special 

244.50 245.39 B: mhm 

249.46 250.37 B: right 

249.64 255.75 A: [sigh] but then over time i r- i saw like her you know her worldly savvy come out 

255.14 256.42 B: mhm 

255.82 263.69 A: [sigh] and she has a pretty tough background her [sigh] parents pretty much abandoned her early on and she lived with her grandparents and when her grandparents died she lived with her sister and all that stuff 

262.03 264.21 B: (( mm )) 

263.94 268.07 A: [sigh] so she already had that uh [sigh] that survivalist attitude 

267.86 268.92 B: right 

268.39 281.16 A: and then when she got into the business world and she works for an association management company and she is like the lifeblood of that place [sigh] you know i really saw how she [lipsmack] was able to learn how to [mn] like uh what people's intentions were 

274.33 275.29 B: mhm 

281.04 281.99 B: right 

281.16 287.25 A: and the subtleties and things like that and i'm kinda like a musician and an artist i don't really pay attention to that crap too much [laughter] 

286.21 288.14 B: yeah oh yeah 

287.48 289.25 A: so we're we're a pretty good match 

289.14 293.98 B: [sigh] that's interesting 'cause you know people will say that those are the best kind of people to get together you know 

293.82 304.31 B: you're artistic you're not really business orientated and she and maybe [sigh] you know maybe that'll help in the your relationship where you you your input is you know artistic creative and hers is [sigh] well here's h- you know here's a reality situation here's 

304.18 318.56 B: here's black and white here's you know the r- you know here's uh here's our financial state do you find that that's that that's like the way things fall or do you kinda [sigh] have you kind of turned around and and more or less [sigh] you know become more of a financial mind or or do you leave that all to her 

318.03 327.08 A: [sigh] [sigh] uh pretty much i don't even know how much money we have in the check book [sigh] right now [laughter] [sigh] uh in fact i'm unemployed right now so i probably should find out [sigh] but uh 

321.40 323.62 B: uh-huh [laughter] 

325.46 326.75 B: right right [laughter] 

326.92 332.44 B: so am i that's why i'm doing this partially [laughter] [laughter] uh yeah it's not bad 

328.54 331.18 A: [laughter] [sigh] thirty bucks 

331.48 333.23 A: [laughter] it's a quick eight 

333.01 345.43 B: yeah that's kind of how how my me and my girlfriend are actually too because she's very businesslike i i just got a job off her that [sigh] um you know it was i i i really kinda had this inkling in me that it was a little shady uh the guy i spoke to and [sigh] 

333.43 334.71 A: [laughter] 

345.26 358.08 B: and i had a bad feeling about it but it was so it was like a lot of money for a real short period of time and i thought to myself and i'm i've got a job lined up for a month from now [sigh] but you know how it is to unemployed you have all this time but no money to do anything with it [laughter] 

349.91 350.90 A: mhm 

357.29 358.65 A: oh yeah oh yeah 

358.02 365.04 B: so uh and she knows that and she's been good about it and and she's employed and but she's real responsible real [sigh] businesslike um 

364.89 367.36 B: you know has had that background and i said you know 

367.35 382.15 B: uh let me just run this by at dinner and she went no way you're out of your mind don't do that like you know [sigh] and i didn't take it to say like i didn't sit there and go don't tell me what to do you know i'm a big boy but what [sigh] you know that was kind of the confirmation i kinda knew that it wasn't the right thing but i was thinking but it's so much money i could really use that money right now 

370.37 371.64 A: [laughter] 

381.35 382.71 A: [laughter] 

382.04 388.22 B: and she said you're crazy don't do that don't even don't even call that guy back and i said you know what you're right so [laughter] 

388.16 399.38 B: you know to have to i think you're right to be able to [sigh] to have somebody tell you something and it and it be not offensive and you know that that your best interests are at their heart [sigh] i think i think that's important i think that's probably what it comes down to 

395.67 396.91 A: (( oh yeah oh yeah )) 

399.13 412.24 A: [sigh] yeah and especially when you're in a situation where you're unemployed and looking for something [sigh] like i was in the same situation i got offered this ridiculous job [sigh] uh doing research for a company who's interested [sigh] in um doing business with african companies 

402.90 403.78 B: (( right mhm )) 

405.44 411.90 B: (( hm )) 

412.51 422.33 A: and on the surface and in the seminar i went to it all seemed like it could be real [sigh] but then when we started getting the materials in the mail like in a it was like on old left over three hole punch paper 

422.68 430.35 A: and i couldn't verify any of the phone numbers you know and stuff like that and she was the one saying [sigh] look it's a frigging scam [laughter] get away from it [laughter] 

428.39 430.05 B: (( mhm mhm [laughter] yeah yeah )) 

430.14 440.05 B: [laughter] i've gotten some weird emails i guess from supposed south african people wanting me to like invest with them [sigh] i wonder if that's the same group of people or what was the dealer with that 

439.53 441.68 A: i think it's a a different scam 

441.70 442.76 B: (( mm [noise] )) 

441.75 443.96 A: their their whole thing is um 

444.30 454.45 A: [sigh] like you take a test and if you do really well in the test they'll hire you but they'll say that you need training in other areas and you take their courses and it's like thirteen hundred bucks a course 

450.65 451.76 B: mhm 

454.24 455.71 B: right right 

455.18 461.83 A: and you know they rented the hotel for six hundred [sigh] so they can get twenty fifty suckers to fall for it they make a lot of money [sigh] 

461.38 467.31 B: sure and they they don't guarantee you're getting a job from it they don't guarantee you anything just that you're going to spend thirteen hundred dollars 

466.76 470.61 A: [sigh] actually they do guarantee you the job if you pass the test 

469.85 471.48 B: oh is that right wow 

470.72 481.75 A: yeah but i'm sure if you're taking their courses you're not going to pass their tests [laughter] and you're out thirteen hundred bucks [sigh] and on top of that why wouldn't they go for college grads that are like studying african culture [laughter] [sigh] 

474.39 475.80 B: [laughter] 

476.65 478.18 B: (( yeah and )) 

481.60 485.88 B: [sigh] yeah yeah that's really odd they're just they're just soliciting the general public 

486.43 488.15 B: that that is pretty strange 

486.51 490.13 A: yes i'm i'm i'm going back to pizza delivery at least that's honest 

489.92 496.26 B: [sigh] yeah it's honest and it's cash it's not bad i i don't have an economical enough car to do that or i would that was one of the things that went through my mind [sigh]

537.85 538.83 A: mhm 

538.08 550.90 B: um but it was it was a pretty interesting way to meet people and just you know spend a nice day in the city but it was it was kinda you know [sigh] as you can imagine if you've ever been to manhattan a lot of traffic a lot of [sigh] congestion a lot of horn blowing a lot of noise it was uh
