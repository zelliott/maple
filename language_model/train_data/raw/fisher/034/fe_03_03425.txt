145.83 151.66 A: so but yeah my wife uh she's working with assisted living and she um 

152.25 156.74 A: you when i was uh dating her sort of what i looked for was uh i

170.10 172.28 B: [laughter] 

173.30 174.46 A: but uh 

174.95 177.66 A: i think that you know that's important 

177.00 178.94 B: yes yes 

179.25 183.78 B: very important well i know when i first met my husband the 

183.54 196.13 B: [mn] we spent the afternoon chatting and and when we parted he said may i give you a hug i have a feeling i like you more than you like me and i probably won't see you again [laughter] and here we are eighteen years later 

192.26 195.15 A: [laughter] 

195.56 197.00 A: mhm 

197.62 200.39 B: but uh yeah trust is a big thing 

197.73 198.64 A: so 

201.44 202.58 B: and uh 

201.59 204.44 A: yeah that's what most of the people that um 

205.20 207.97 A: that that i deal with there and uh 

208.38 212.77 A: you know they're all still hurting but uh they they didn't have 

213.37 215.20 A: [sigh] they didn't have trust 

215.26 217.62 A: in the person that they were with 

217.66 220.33 A: they were too con- they were controlling 

221.39 223.83 A: or someth- you know and they 

222.99 226.70 B: which means they didn't trust themselves either 

227.26 229.51 B: or they wouldn't have made those choices 

229.80 238.83 A: yeah it's it's hard hard to say so one one girl her her husband was was drinking all the time and she didn't she didn't know that you know 

235.51 236.68 B: mhm 

239.43 244.15 A: and uh well uh knew that she didn't know that when she married him 

244.21 246.70 A: but here he was an alcoholic 

247.38 248.69 A: and uh 

248.95 254.02 A: so she's run she's run into those same problems where when she's dating with somebody 

254.19 257.24 A: she doesn't know whether to [laughter] trust him now or not 

256.61 257.90 B: yeah 

257.98 261.46 A: because when she was dating her first husband 

261.94 265.09 A: (( he [mn] there were no signs of that you know )) 

264.87 270.88 B: well and and if he's an alcoholic it tends to come on more gradually you know first it's just party time 

269.74 271.86 A: mhm 

271.39 274.69 B: and then the first thing you know it's got you and there you are 

274.58 276.91 A: yeah and i guess he hid it pretty well 

276.56 278.37 B: oh did he mhm 

277.72 281.12 A: yeah that's why she didn't know when they were dating 

280.48 282.14 B: mhm
