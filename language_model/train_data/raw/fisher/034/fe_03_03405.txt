100.16 101.25 B: that's okay 

102.08 107.48 B: and may- maybe it just means that you're a little choicer than a lotta people i wasn't young when i got married 

107.55 108.68 B: i was uh 

110.53 112.96 B: i was almost twenty seven 

113.04 115.89 B: which is you know still fairly young but i mean i wasn't 

114.74 116.70 A: that's still fairly young 

116.12 120.12 B: but i wasn't uh i wasn't very you know very young when i got married 

120.20 124.60 A: so you haven't quite had your twenty fifth anniversary yet with your husband 

123.99 127.89 B: well i have we've been married we've been married almost twenty nine years 

124.94 126.13 A: oh you have 

127.79 129.51 A: wow okay 

129.05 131.97 B: so yes we've been through that we have three daughters 

131.99 133.22 B: and uh 

132.30 139.11 A: that's great well i'm just a couple of years younger than you but i'm in the same general you know 

139.12 142.66 A: chronology i'm in my fifties so um 

141.33 143.07 B: yeah so am i okay 

143.01 145.96 A: so yeah um 

146.09 154.40 A: so i've had a lot of serious relationships and maybe not a lot but i've had several serious relationships and 

154.61 158.27 A: the longest one was nine years where i lived with the man 

158.09 160.49 B: that's a long time that's a long time 

159.11 163.43 A: yeah and we were in connecticut um but then there were 

163.83 168.16 A: sometimes really long periods of time when i didn't have 

168.18 173.07 A: anything that i would consider a serious relationship so 

173.48 183.94 B: and the reason why you you your your relationships ended was because you either mutually or one or the other of you felt that it wasn't something that you could continue to do that 

182.78 189.37 A: well interestingly um the person that i lived with for nine years i moved um 

189.40 195.40 A: i i got a phd in one of the sciences in biology actually microbiology 

195.21 209.21 A: and i was going for most post doctoral fellowship at the time leaving connecticut and going to seattle and he was supposed to follow me and he was an artist and in the process of his 

209.28 216.95 A: getting some kind of government kind of position in the arts temporarily on sort of a grant basis 

216.96 231.12 A: um he was staying for a few months and then in that period of time um this particular man he can't like obviously be without a woman and so he found another relationship like immediately 

230.57 231.51 B: wow 

231.67 246.02 A: and you know and it's the sort of i think men do that search and replace right away it's easier than trying to maintain a long distance relationship or something so our relationship ended because of that i mean i tried to 

246.10 250.28 A: go back and get him to change his mind and everything but you know 

250.17 261.31 A: he was too entrenched and then that relationship with him ended and he tried to get back with me like a couple of years later and i said you know forget it i mean the 

259.87 263.21 B: i'm not leftovers well good for you because that's important 

261.46 272.34 A: the trust yeah i said you know the trust has been eroded and everything and there were other incidents in the nine years so i didn't think he was gonna make a complete 

272.65 280.10 A: shall we say psychological cultural shift and and i had lost the ability to be able to trust him 

276.06 277.12 B: right 

279.83 294.38 B: and and that's one of the the main one of the biggest issues is is the ability to trust one another and that's very important in any relationship and that's something that we have been very fortunate you know my husband and i have been very fortunate it's always been there um 

285.78 286.65 A: right 

294.47 295.31 B: (( you know )) 

294.65 303.34 A: and so you think that like really long term monogamy is really possible between two people that's that's great it's great 

299.38 301.83 B: oh definitely oh definitely 

302.22 310.64 B: it's definitely possible i and i know you don't see a whole lot of it anymore but um my husband and i are very very close and we have a very 

310.73 314.65 B: good relationship in that we can com- communicate very well um 

314.51 319.57 B: we've learned you know and and it's not to say that there aren't times that we disagree on things and that and that 

319.39 334.23 B: uh one gets a little bit hot but we get through it very quickly it's not something that we let go you know we'll work through it you can blow off stream and then you know go back and apologize for yelling but you say you know this is how i feel about this and we've learnt how to communicate better over the years 

333.11 335.15 A: that's fantastic 

334.42 343.67 B: and that's very important um we respect each other's opinions and we don't agree on everything we we never have and we never will but uh we you know we 

344.17 350.97 B: as far as raising our children and having the same kinds of values we've had those so those the basic things have been there um 

351.07 360.44 B: [lipsmack] my husband's a very hard worker he's he's very dedicated to his family he would do anything for me that i ever asked of him he would i mean he would it's like he w- worships the ground i 

360.49 366.56 B: walk on and it's kinda frightening to me sometimes because it it's an awesome responsibility but um 

366.88 374.23 B: he's a wonderful man he's very even tempered very very rarely does he lose his temper uh and when he does he blows it off and then 

374.37 377.66 B: we get through it and it's okay you know um 

377.80 378.91 B: but uh 

378.02 386.10 A: well i think you two are very fortunate that you found each other and that you worked hard at this um and 

380.69 381.93 B: we really you know 

385.14 398.66 B: and and working hard is very is it's a major thing [laughter] i mean it's not it's never easy and it never gets easier actually it doesn't i think the longer you go sometimes the harder it can be because you know you have more and more responsibility to one another 

390.77 391.80 A: mhm 

398.52 406.76 B: but we're you know we we still have uh well one daughter in under grad school and one's in graduate school right now another one's out of school um 

406.87 419.66 B: but uh you know we still have financial responsibility to our children at this point and um you know what we feel is our responsibility and because we can afford to do it you know we we take that responsibility 

419.69 422.29 B: and uh but you know 

422.80 430.74 B: not too far down the road we'll it'll just be financially we'll only be worried about ourselves so that'll take some of the pressure off both of us and uh 

430.91 443.29 B: um i was fortunate that when my children were growing up i was able to stay home i'm a i'm a school psychologist so i do have a professional degree and you know i right now i'm working part time but that's because i wanted to 

443.22 448.32 B: keep my mind going you know so it's not because i have to work which is nice because i can 

444.95 446.04 A: mhm 

448.74 456.54 B: i don't work for a school one particular school district i work through an intermediary you know which you know i can go to any school in the county so it's nice 

455.51 458.57 A: so it's like a consulting kind of arrangement 

458.01 460.99 B: yes it is and it's very nice i mean i do the same 

460.28 461.47 A: excellent 

461.11 469.00 B: i do the same thing that the uh psychologists in the districts do but i except i don't get involved in all the meetings and all the hassle [laughter] i just you know 

468.20 470.75 A: and all the administrative ha-ha 

469.22 473.99 B: all the administrative yes you know in any kind of job especially in education but uh 

474.11 484.39 B: yeah so i i enjoy that and i'll be doing that probably for maybe two more years but uh as my husband gets closer to retirement age then i'll you know the two of us will 

484.67 489.93 B: probably travel more than we're doing now although we've been doing more traveling in the last five years but 

490.24 497.71 B: we we enjoy doing that together and with sometimes with the kids and sometimes without them but um and they're not kids anymore they're young ladies but uh 

497.92 512.66 B: uh we're leaving saturday as a matter for a vacation so it'll be nice we're going to florida that's that's my husband's ideal vacation going to the beach and he works very hard and that's where we go and that's fine with me you know i can go relax read a book do whatever i want so 

500.71 501.98 A: where are you going 

503.00 504.05 A: okay 

505.77 506.82 A: [laughter] 

512.80 514.77 B: it's very relaxing in uh 

514.93 518.75 B: in the daytime and in the evenings we always find something to do to keep busy 

518.78 519.88 B: so it's 

519.92 523.63 B: um but a good relationship is a lotta hard work 

523.85 536.57 B: but it's worth it you know i mean there's so many benefits from it that it's worth the work that you put into it i'm not a person that if something happened to my husband and when my husband dies if he dies before i do that needs to go out and replace him 

528.55 529.60 A: mhm 

536.82 540.41 B: i mean it's very difficult having a good marriage and 

540.69 545.11 B: i figure you know i'm fortunate to have it once i don't need to have it again 

546.11 551.20 B: i wouldn't be real quick to go out and get remarried it's not something i i'm not saying i would never do it 

551.30 554.12 B: but it's not something i i would look for actively 

554.16 564.69 A: right well you've had such a wonderful relationship and such great memories that god forbid if anything happened you know you might um just you know deal with 

562.60 563.66 B: right 

564.78 565.62 B: i mean 

564.81 570.54 A: learning to be on your own and and still having your husband's memory you know 

569.12 582.22 B: that's right you know and and maybe that's it i i mean there's some women who who need to have a man like some men need to have a woman you know to help to take care of them or whatever and i don't feel that i need that i mean i've i've been very fortunate to have that but i don't 

583.03 588.90 B: [sigh] and i guess because it has been so good that uh but it's a lotta hard work and i figure you know 

589.11 594.10 B: i don't know if i'd be willing to put that into a second relationship if that opportunity came along 

592.35 593.44 A: mhm 

594.14 599.89 B: i'm not saying i would deny it if it happened you know but it's not something i would actively definitely would not actively look for
