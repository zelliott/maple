0.55 1.72 A: hello 

1.19 2.44 B: (( hello )) 

2.94 4.58 A: hi my name is debbie 

4.25 5.48 B: hi richard 

5.58 6.63 A: hi richard 

6.79 9.12 B: (( so let's see )) 

6.88 7.64 A: i guess 

9.39 11.92 B: life partners with our most important what 

11.99 14.72 A: the most important thing in a life partner 

14.38 15.50 B: oh 

15.85 16.89 B: okay 

18.45 19.18 A: i 

19.48 20.35 A: well 

20.81 24.18 A: i hate the phrase life partner to begin [laughter] with [laughter] 

23.93 28.14 B: uh yeah that seems [mn] it's a rather awkward 

28.94 34.37 B: uh way to put it i guess it's supposed to be as generic as possible 

35.01 36.31 B: whatever uh 

35.02 36.24 A: i think they're tr- 

36.79 40.27 B: whatever situation you may happen to create for yourself i guess 

40.89 44.10 A: yeah i think they were trying to be politically correct 

41.01 41.73 B: [laughter] 

43.59 44.88 B: (( yes )) 

44.49 48.74 A: well for me my life partner is my husband 

47.64 52.31 B: well i think that's probably true for most of the world [laughter] 

53.41 54.95 A: uh the most 

54.10 55.03 B: uh 

55.52 58.98 B: so what do you find most important in him what you know what 

60.26 67.18 A: well for me the most important thing in choosing my husband was you know compatibility on a lot of issues 

67.67 69.00 B: mhm 

69.31 70.35 A: um 

72.01 74.21 A: you know you got to be compatible 

74.62 79.37 A: we had similar backgrounds and same religion 

79.59 82.17 A: same likes and dislikes 

83.50 86.55 A: kind of hard to spend your life with somebody you don't have anything in common with 

86.09 87.25 B: that's true 

87.41 88.52 B: the uh 

89.10 90.96 B: the allure of uh 

91.12 94.53 B: you know first meeting somebody wears off relatively fast [laughter] [laughter] 

94.23 95.49 A: [laughter] 

97.14 104.97 B: [mn] it's supposed to last about three months and then it starts tapering off from there so better have something more than just infatuation 

104.86 106.12 A: that's right 

107.96 110.72 B: [laughter] yeah i think uh at least 

111.00 112.99 B: i think probably um 

113.84 117.80 B: probably the way i characterize it is uh number one 

117.84 119.51 B: you got to be like um 

119.59 123.63 B: like your best friend you know either somebody you can 

124.00 125.80 B: hang with talk with 

126.02 131.22 B: share with without fear of judgement etcetera 

133.25 134.43 A: good point 

137.04 143.22 A: i i think a lot of people are looking for that ini- initial infatuation 

143.20 145.26 B: yeah to last forever [laughter] 

144.60 149.08 A: yeah and when that doesn't last they bail and they look for another relationship 

148.76 150.63 B: yeah 

152.12 154.21 B: you know i think that's probably true 

155.45 157.46 B: whereas as i um 

157.54 163.61 B: see what i read is that there's another trend is that basically they have uh test marriages 

164.07 165.15 A: [laughter] 

164.12 168.58 B: [laughter] where they like feel it out see what the you know the you know 

169.26 173.22 B: you know sort of sample it a little bit then go find the real thing [mn] 

174.80 177.48 A: well i've been married eleven years 

177.05 177.94 B: (( oh )) 

177.76 180.90 A: and every day it's a decision to stay together 

180.57 181.63 B: mhm 

180.99 188.86 A: you know you you we've committed for the long haul so whether you're you feel that initial [laughter] infatuation or the 

189.00 192.36 A: y- you know it doesn't matter it's it's not a daily thing 

192.47 194.49 A: it's a commitment to the end 

194.20 195.90 B: yeah 

196.37 197.29 B: (( yeah so )) 

198.10 203.92 A: [mn] so for me the most one of the most important things in finding a life partner would be somebody who has that same commitment 

204.05 205.96 B: yeah willingness to work on it 

205.75 207.24 A: mhm 

205.97 207.33 B: 'cause it is 

207.39 212.57 B: [lipsmack] it just doesn't happen for a long to get it to last forever or 

212.61 216.18 B: you know it it takes effort 

216.40 219.52 B: you got to do a lot of little things to keep it it's like a 

220.65 222.19 B: i don't know do you garden 

223.02 223.82 A: nope 

223.65 224.52 B: oh 

223.87 224.74 A: do you 

224.91 236.14 B: uh i've done it in the past uh i find it difficult with my uh current uh work schedule and so forth but i just know like 

236.01 241.65 B: like a plant uh like a or a bonfire you [mn] you basically have to 

242.22 250.91 B: take care of it it just doesn't grow on its own you have to water it light fertilize it and i think marriages relationships are are the same way 

251.73 252.94 B: if you don't 

253.74 256.86 B: uh give them the right environment they will die 

258.34 259.57 B: from neglect 

259.50 260.83 A: mhm 

259.74 263.90 B: so it's like when you talk about commitment and willingness to work on it 

264.25 265.29 B: um 

265.68 267.83 B: you know it's a decision every day 

268.00 269.17 A: yep 

268.55 271.65 B: uh that's sort of that's what 

272.17 280.12 B: um i think that's part of it you know basically a a commitment to keep nurturing that relationship 

279.70 281.55 A: so what do you think if if 

282.54 287.27 A: if it hasn't been nurtured and it's wilting and maybe dying 

288.03 289.60 A: wh -what do you think 

289.78 291.34 B: well you can 

292.98 295.28 B: you can bring a plant back to life 

295.42 296.14 B: (( if )) 

296.33 301.10 B: uh i've always found that it usually takes about the effort 

300.97 301.61 A: (( [laughter] )) 

302.20 304.66 B: than if you had just simply done maintenance 

304.90 305.81 B: you know 

306.60 307.29 B: (( to )) 

307.40 309.66 B: keep it healthy but um 

310.41 311.64 B: um 

312.25 313.76 B: i think uh 

315.54 317.73 B: so uh first aid is possible 

318.09 325.63 B: but you it again takes you know basically like you said before commitment to actually put in the effort 

327.96 336.59 B: um but i will also say that there are times when it is probably it goes too far and it basically it's like 

336.74 338.86 B: it is dead 

341.02 344.35 B: but i don't that takes a while 

345.33 346.55 A: i would agree 

346.89 350.83 B: that just doesn't happen overnight it's not like you wake up one morning and say oh 

351.35 352.54 B: (( i'm tired of you )) 

352.56 354.44 A: [laughter] 

352.91 354.28 B: time to change 

354.53 358.12 A: i think on t._v. though you watch a lot of movies and that's kind of the 

359.41 360.61 B: yeah 

359.49 364.50 A: the some of the movies oh we've just grown apart and end of story 

364.00 369.34 B: well i think and the choral area of that is also the fact that they just simply 

369.40 371.92 B: fall in love it's like bam 

372.73 376.26 B: and [mn] many times it doesn't always happen that way 

376.58 378.96 B: so you know the where um 

380.14 381.28 B: (( uh )) 

381.30 383.44 B: it's like it happens too quick 

384.66 386.82 B: uh in the movies 

386.92 387.60 A: mm 

387.14 388.36 B: it's like 

389.39 393.00 B: it's almost like the timeline in the movie is they're married in a month [laughter] 

392.52 393.69 A: oh yeah 

393.12 393.85 B: [laughter] 

394.60 398.48 B: and so everything's quick quick on quick off 

396.21 396.92 A: (( [mn] )) 

398.36 398.99 A: (( [laughter] )) 

399.48 406.57 A: my husband and i only knew each other five months when we got married and i wouldn't recommend that for anyone [laughter] 

402.23 403.10 B: (( wow that's )) 

405.93 413.18 B: no i think that's with my experience that can be risky yeah um i'm glad you guys 

413.33 414.29 B: (( you know )) 

414.65 419.47 B: it worked out for you but i i don't know from what i've observed that's that can be risky 

419.21 423.20 A: yep it sure makes for a rocky start when you don't really know the person 

422.16 428.36 B: yeah exactly and it's not like you guys made the commitment uh to 

429.07 433.53 B: work through those but it can make it the beginning very rough 

436.74 440.56 B: and i think uh [noise] 

440.64 446.69 B: i think my recommendation to like friends and stuff is you know be with the person at least two years 

446.92 451.93 B: to really get to know them so you can spend the next sixty with them 

454.24 460.68 A: yeah so what is your opinion on living with somebody to choose a life partner try it out for a while 

458.82 459.69 B: (( [sigh] )) 

460.63 461.87 B: (( mm )) 

462.45 466.71 B: no i don't [mn] i have my experience is that doesn't work 

466.93 468.61 B: unless you're already 

468.85 472.14 B: made a marriage commitment up front 

472.15 472.98 A: uh-huh 

472.34 476.24 B: and maybe you're getting together out of convenience that you've already got 

476.26 488.86 B: the commitment's already there you know you're engaged marriage plans or you know next month and you know but just to sample it um my 

489.06 490.93 B: my experience is that it 

491.56 495.95 B: it changes there's a whole different expectation which is living together versus 

496.05 497.47 B: uh a marriage 

498.12 499.11 A: i i 

498.15 500.31 B: or the expectation of a marriage 

500.29 502.48 A: i completely agree i 

502.59 503.45 B: so you 

502.64 510.76 A: i think that there's some statistic about how many marriages fail and it was a pretty high number i don't remember it's like fifty percent of all marriages fail 

510.16 511.51 B: mhm 

510.59 519.55 A: but when you look at the percentage of marriages that fail where the people lived together first it's double that 

516.71 517.92 B: mhm 

518.84 521.94 B: yeah and i think it's just because 

523.00 529.88 B: it's just your your mindset is totally different and it's sort of like going through 

532.88 540.26 B: i don't know it's like your level of commitment is just so different and then you create a whole bunch of false expectations 

540.64 544.44 B: [mn] if you do marry that um 

544.72 547.66 B: it just you will become disillusioned 

544.89 545.45 A: (( mm )) 

549.58 550.52 A: well 

549.72 552.90 B: and so i haven't i haven't seen it 

552.92 556.15 B: really work for a long haul you know 

556.71 566.19 B: i'm trying to think of somebody that i've met that who just happened to be living together and got married and it lasted for 

568.15 569.40 B: you know for 

570.21 575.84 B: where i would expect them to live 'til you know their golden anniversary and i can't think of a one 

576.28 578.12 A: i can't either mm 

583.06 586.77 B: i think that was my observation is that it just 

587.37 592.22 B: the expectations are totally different going in and and 

592.05 593.64 A: oh i think there's something 

592.40 595.05 B: it almost deludes you you delude yourself [mn] 

594.99 599.95 A: there's something about being [mn] married and having that commitment that you can be a hundred percent
