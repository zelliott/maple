0.00 1.97 B: hi i'm bevanne 

1.91 3.74 A: hi i'm carol 

4.35 5.34 B: um 

6.40 8.37 B: [noise] five fifteen 

9.16 11.35 B: that's a rough one um 

13.03 18.14 B: around here it would probably work california it wouldn't new york it wouldn't [noise] 

18.33 19.58 B: your views 

19.26 25.97 A: [mn] well um what's a you know don't laugh too much but what's the minimum wage right now 

26.65 29.18 B: i think it's four sixty five 

28.56 32.88 A: is it so that would be roughly a fifty cent increase 

32.64 33.89 B: yeah 

33.20 34.87 A: which um 

34.97 38.31 A: [lipsmack] i you know i guess really to 

38.16 50.75 A: to figure out if that's enough of a a raise i guess you kinda have to look at it historically and see what kind of increases that they've experienced and why they've done them historically i guess to really get a a good scientific 

50.62 60.64 A: determination as to whether that's enough [sigh] but um to me minimum wage is usually what they pay to 

60.77 69.60 A: you know kids who are getting their first job or to people who are unskilled and somewhat unreliable 

70.10 75.65 A: uh do you do you agree that that's kinda what the minimum wage is supposed to represent 

77.29 85.31 B: [noise] pretty much um but what arizona the state i live in it's a right to work state and there's a lot of people that just make minimum wage 

85.39 86.27 B: but 

85.52 87.70 A: really what does right to work mean 

87.86 88.95 A: (( what do you mean )) 

89.50 90.53 B: oh [noise] 

91.83 93.96 B: it's non unionized 

93.97 100.07 A: okay you know what i live in south carolina and i think that that's the way it is here too 

94.21 95.06 B: but 

99.92 100.92 B: okay 

100.71 104.02 A: yeah and i think that that kinda makes it very difficult 

104.06 109.51 A: to fire people and do that kind of thing if i remember hearing something to that effect 

109.30 110.73 B: yeah 

110.02 111.09 A: um 

111.15 112.98 A: but uh 

113.33 118.95 A: well [laughter] it's just very difficult to live on not minimum wage [mn] 

119.35 131.75 A: so you know as to whether or not that is sufficient it i don't think it's designed for people to be able to support themselves i mean do you think so 

119.61 120.56 B: right 

131.62 137.92 A: but on the other hand you gotta be able to motivate these college kids or else they're not gonna get off their lazy bums [laughter] 

131.79 132.64 B: (( um )) 

137.16 138.40 B: this is true 

138.57 145.88 B: um the people that i know that make minimum wage they're living like three and four and five families to a house 

145.98 147.45 A: oh wow 

148.14 151.63 B: there are some that are in this area that do that 

151.96 154.28 B: or they have substandard housing 

154.74 155.72 B: um 

156.85 159.61 B: it's more than welfare but 

158.59 159.60 A: (( [sigh] mhm )) 

160.06 161.86 B: i don't think it'd be easy 

161.79 165.67 A: no well this is true you know um 

167.70 173.84 A: if we're if you're looking at it from a perspective of this is an unskilled um labor force 

173.48 174.68 B: (( yeah )) 

174.16 179.15 A: and um you know they're g- i guess they're just they're they're 

179.51 186.98 A: it's necessary for them to just take just about any kind of job that you can get that they can get um 

183.95 185.04 B: right 

187.32 191.94 A: it's it's i guess it's only nominally better than being on welfare huh 

191.92 193.78 B: yeah um 

192.60 193.67 A: yeah 

195.56 196.72 B: (( i don't )) 

198.99 200.79 A: i'm sorry what was that 

199.37 199.96 B: (( know )) 

200.19 203.90 B: oh trying to think i don't know that much about it 

204.02 205.27 A: yeah i know 

204.13 205.08 B: (( um )) 

205.05 219.84 A: you know what kills me though is you go into a place and this is really not off topic but you go into a place where you know [mn] you're getting ice cream at the baskin robbins or something like that and they have a tip jar 

216.86 218.48 B: yeah and they make minimum 

219.88 222.62 A: you know do you see do you get that there 

220.11 221.02 B: (( yeah )) 

222.60 224.83 B: yeah everybody lives on tips here 

224.77 234.95 A: well you know i get a little frustrated when you go into a place where you're paying for the product and the um [lipsmack] the 

231.24 232.17 B: right 

234.72 244.27 A: cost that the or the wage that the store pays to that person is supposed to pay for 

244.34 248.21 A: that service now you know a waitress 

248.22 252.39 A: we tip waitresses and i was in the restaurant business 

250.29 251.09 B: (( yes )) 

252.72 254.53 A: so i believe in tipping 

254.56 258.33 A: waitresses because they are not even getting minimum wage 

257.98 259.28 B: right 

258.66 271.16 A: you know they're getting paid a wage that is in anticipation of them getting a tip so and that's just historically the way it is and it seems like people 

271.42 276.04 A: you know they're getting paid minimum wage or they're getting eight bucks an hour or whatever they're getting 

275.89 288.21 A: to wait on you in the in the uh coffee shop and you go in there and they want your tips on the top of what you're paying for this latte or whatever and i get really i- irate about that 

285.32 286.22 B: right 

288.22 289.73 B: (( yeah um )) 

288.81 290.89 A: you know i don't like that [sigh] 

292.58 295.05 B: but some of them don't make minimum wage 

296.58 299.99 B: the waiters and waitresses around here i know don't make minimum wage 

299.47 302.54 A: oh i know and that's why we tip them right 

302.10 303.22 B: right 

302.57 305.17 A: that's i mean and it's like their wage 

305.20 308.36 A: um scale is um 

308.38 308.95 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

308.79 310.62 B: shrunk jeeze 

309.96 315.39 A: well yeah and and you just and and i guess it's just the way it is i mean 

316.24 323.18 A: i guess let me think i can't th- think of exactly how i'm trying to explain this it's just the way it's always been 

323.16 324.22 B: yeah 

323.53 331.87 A: and it seems like people who put their little jars out at baskin robbins they're just trying to capitalize on everybody being programmed 

329.81 330.88 B: because they 

331.23 334.36 B: baskin robbins do they make better than minimum do you know 

335.12 344.45 A: [sigh] well okay let's say that they make minimum wage i believe that they would make at least minimum wage because it's not a a tip 

338.47 339.21 B: okay 

344.61 347.01 A: situation normally 

347.03 351.45 A: you know it's what people are trying to turn it into do you see what i'm saying 

350.00 350.96 B: okay 

351.12 352.33 B: yeah 

351.68 353.99 A: so i'm pretty confident 

354.00 356.66 A: that they make at least minimum wage 

356.33 357.32 B: okay 

357.48 362.70 A: which at at which point would you feel compelled to tip somebody 

363.29 366.08 A: if you knew they were making at least minimum wage 

365.83 366.65 B: no 

366.54 370.66 A: yeah and and if you went in to get your ice cream 

371.20 376.76 A: you know [mn] i get i don't i don't get ugly with them but you know i certainly don't tip them 

376.71 377.84 B: right 

377.09 382.23 A: because i'm feeling like this is just part of what i'm paying the service for 

382.83 385.85 A: and um i don't know like if you 

385.12 387.82 B: okay like dealers in las vegas 

387.34 388.21 A: yes 

388.27 389.67 B: i i tip them 

389.49 390.53 A: yeah 

390.87 393.60 B: um the change girls the 

390.92 392.19 A: (( well 'cause )) 

394.28 396.83 B: just about everybody in the casino 'cause that's 

396.85 398.18 B: it's traditional 

397.99 406.49 A: well there you go that's the word i was looking for that's it it's traditional and i'm with you there you know because they give you service 

406.73 408.08 A: and 

408.17 413.67 A: well yeah it's just something that is traditional that you've do- that you've always done 

413.62 420.97 B: but as far as new new establishments no i don't think so i get i i definitely agree with you there 

420.82 423.29 A: so you live in arizona 

423.07 424.31 B: on the border 

424.26 426.63 A: so so um 

426.76 430.46 A: in between las um nevada and 

430.53 432.11 A: and um [lipsmack] 

432.40 433.46 B: arizona 

432.88 434.08 A: arizona 

433.72 434.83 B: yeah 

434.12 441.94 A: so and do you think that um or do you think that nationally wages are high there or they're typically low 

441.51 442.80 B: typically low 

442.77 443.89 A: are they 

443.61 446.00 B: but the cost of living's low too 

445.92 447.04 A: oh is it 

447.70 452.06 A: well that's good in in south carolina here um 

453.08 458.66 A: [lipsmack] i would have to say that jobs are very difficult to get right now i think they are everywhere 

456.72 457.60 B: okay 

458.48 472.49 A: they're di- very difficult to get and you have people who are very qualified that are working you know like if they have a a college degree or something and they're working in a in a job 

469.85 470.49 B: (( yeah )) 

472.45 474.43 A: doing secretarial work 

474.59 482.44 A: so you know i think that because of the economy the way it is people are happy to work 

475.29 476.22 B: okay 

479.19 480.23 B: yeah 

482.46 489.16 A: underneath what they're capable of doing or for less than they would normally get because they're just happy to get a job 

489.77 491.04 B: okay yeah 

490.80 492.27 A: you know what i'm saying 

491.93 496.83 B: yeah here jobs are frequent but yeah they none of them pay very well 

496.92 501.35 A: really are they more labor intensive jobs like 

501.62 503.53 B: yes they are 

502.40 503.50 A: okay 

503.55 508.93 A: [mn] not like white collar professional kind of jobs like you have in new york city 

508.94 509.65 B: no 

509.52 510.59 A: okay 

510.19 512.41 B: don't have hardly any of that 

511.76 523.35 A: yeah well you have some of that here but not a lot of it so um and and the cost of living here is very low but you know in order to get 

520.85 521.65 B: okay 

523.46 529.36 A: i have a fourteen year old son and in order to get him to go out and get a job 

529.21 531.61 A: i mean he's gonna have to be impressed 

531.41 544.58 A: with [laughter] you know what he's [laughter] what he's what he's gonna get paid i can see it i know 'cause i want him to go out and get a job 'cause he can this [sigh] this um summer and you know i i know he'll be getting minimum wage 

531.76 532.55 B: (( yeah )) 

533.05 533.89 B: (( something )) 

544.66 545.86 A: which 

547.29 548.30 A: i mean 

548.71 560.88 A: i remember when i first started working i was being paid two dollars an hour and i was happy but that was minimum wage and i was you know fourteen or fifteen years old and that was a long time ago 

554.05 554.68 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

561.63 562.69 A: but 

561.88 567.68 B: around here my son's thirteen and we're setting up apprenticeships for him 

564.28 565.81 A: oh you uh-huh 

567.42 568.40 A: uh-huh 

568.49 575.17 B: they'll be volunteer k- kinda work where at least he'll have that for his resume for later on in his life but yeah they don't pay much 

573.79 574.78 A: right 

574.89 583.82 A: right right well it's a good thing that he values that because my son at this point he doesn't value that he's like um 

584.11 597.02 A: [mn] yeah i don't know he he thinks he doesn't even apply himself in school because he thinks he's just gonna grow up and be a professional hockey player ice hockey player okay so we're like dealing with this work issue thing uh ethic thing here 

591.37 592.61 B: (( okay okay )) 

596.98 599.89 A: and he thinks everything comes easy and i guess
