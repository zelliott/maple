5.75 7.14 A: nice to meet you 

6.95 8.62 B: this is my first time doing this

9.30 11.92 B: oh good [laughter] so 

11.00 13.26 A: i just signed up today actually 

12.58 14.49 B: yeah me too that's weird 

14.08 15.24 A: yeah 

14.60 15.66 B: um 

15.72 18.57 B: so what do you look for in a life partner [laughter] mm 

18.18 19.41 A: (( um )) 

19.57 22.99 A: i think the most important thing um well initially 

23.01 26.72 A: it's kind of you know the physical thing but um 

27.11 32.17 A: after you get past that i think definitely um personality 

32.24 33.26 A: my 

33.41 34.92 A: husband's very 

35.05 37.99 A: funny you know and he always keeps me laughing and 

37.69 38.75 B: (( yep )) 

38.18 40.46 A: i think that's important and also 

40.55 43.27 B: i don't mean to butt in i'm going to turn my phone up one sec 

41.73 42.92 A: oh yeah go ahead 

45.09 46.65 B: okay sorry about that 

46.32 48.95 A: um but also i think i mean 

49.33 53.56 A: as we've learned as we've married for a little while um 

56.54 58.73 A: [laughter] because 

56.99 58.20 B: [laughter] 

59.01 60.35 A: neither one of us 

60.38 64.50 A: we're both spenders you know we're not real frugal with our money so 

61.94 62.86 B: uh-huh 

63.57 64.64 B: (( that's cool )) 

65.03 73.30 A: so that's important too but [laughter] i'm not going to trade him in just because of that [laughter] 'cause i'm guilty myself so 

66.83 68.05 B: yeah 

69.61 71.04 B: yeah yeah 

72.53 78.10 B: yeah i um i actually just got engaged and i yeah and i think of 

76.05 78.27 A: oh wow congratulations 

78.11 91.83 B: of course it's the physical attraction of course that's probably the first thing you see in a person um i think also a big thing is trust and openness um i think communication is one of my biggest 

81.54 82.65 A: mhm 

88.65 89.65 A: mhm 

92.09 93.33 B: biggest things 

93.00 94.11 A: mhm 

93.53 94.68 B: um 

95.04 99.21 B: honesty and not hiding anything and um 

98.13 98.91 A: yeah 

100.04 101.28 B: i think 

101.36 102.26 B: um 

102.30 104.84 B: (( i've lost my train of thought now um )) 

105.68 111.09 B: oh as far as i was going to say money management we actually both deal with our own funds 

111.05 113.25 B: and we keep everything separate and we 

111.24 112.18 A: oh okay 

112.52 113.33 A: mhm 

113.06 127.29 B: we split everything you know rent any bills that come in we split everything we have our own vehicles and and that's always gonna stay i think [laughter] i think it's kinda easier to handle stuff that way i think even after we're married it'll probably still be like that 

114.42 115.23 A: mhm 

118.48 119.56 A: mhm 

126.69 127.67 A: mhm 

127.49 132.38 B: um 'cause i know a lotta fights and what not come from that so 

132.37 134.37 A: yeah yeah 

133.09 140.81 B: yeah i think that's probably a big a big thing um but it it'll probably be hard to do especially after we have children and everything but 

140.47 146.72 A: yeah it is hard to keep things i mean we were that way too before we got married um 

145.98 147.22 B: mhm 

146.95 153.09 A: you know we had everything separate and i mean it was just easier that way i mean we had different names and stuff too you know so 

152.86 154.08 B: (( yep mhm )) 

153.10 155.18 A: um and then 

155.38 157.80 A: you know after we got married we 

157.81 159.84 A: kinda kept it that way 

159.85 168.20 A: until we moved and then we moved and we kinda you know set up our bank accounts and stuff you know and um 

168.25 173.86 A: it just kinda all got thrown together um which wasn't really a big deal but 

173.51 174.47 B: yeah 

174.19 179.27 A: it is easier sometimes and you kinda feel like it's your money you know 

178.70 180.36 B: and do you have children and all 

180.16 182.24 A: um actually i have a nine month old 

182.23 183.16 B: oh you do 

182.83 183.78 A: yes 

183.17 185.88 B: well congratulations on that [laughter] 

184.59 187.64 A: thank you yes she's she's great 

185.97 190.60 B: yes i think it'll just get complicated when it gets to children and stuff especially 

190.58 191.73 A: yeah 

190.68 199.17 B: um because especially if i mean i plan on still working fulltime after we do have kids i don't know if 

199.32 203.59 B: hopefully i'll be able to handle that [laughter] i know that's probably very difficult 

200.86 202.06 A: [laughter] 

202.89 205.81 A: yeah i work fulltime and it is very 

204.32 205.28 B: (( do ya )) 

205.56 212.59 B: yeah and um if i do continue to work to work fulltime hopefully we'll still continue you know having things separate um 

211.39 213.28 A: yeah [cough] mhm 

212.77 213.75 B: but 

214.03 219.43 B: um if not obviously it's more difficult for some people if they don't work fulltime and 

219.74 224.98 B: obviously the husband or if he's a stay at home dad then obviously the mother has 

223.89 224.76 A: (( yes )) 

225.04 228.12 B: has to come up with the finances for all the stuff 

226.81 236.33 A: yeah yeah that's the only thing i've i've heard a lot of um like stay at home moms have problems 'cause they don't feel like they have their own money 

236.01 236.95 B: mhm 

236.34 237.96 A: you know um 

237.54 238.60 B: yeah 

238.37 242.55 A: you you know 'cause the husband's making all the money and stuff and they feel like they 

242.67 246.41 A: you know don't really have their own stuff to spend and then 

245.49 251.95 B: and maybe they're not treated the same because of it you know oh i work full- i work and make the money and 

247.36 248.32 A: yeah 

249.08 250.12 A: yeah 

251.57 254.59 A: yeah and they feel like they can't spend 

252.14 253.26 B: yeah 

254.22 256.93 B: i think i'd go crazy without my own money [laughter] 

257.09 266.96 A: yeah it's it's nice to have i mean sometimes i wonder you know we'll both go in spurts where you know we'll be spending stuff 

257.18 258.00 B: i don't 

266.65 267.61 B: mhm 

266.99 267.96 A: um 

268.43 271.13 A: but you know generally we try to 

271.17 273.78 A: keep it pretty even as long as we 

273.93 275.90 A: get the bills paid you know 

275.49 276.49 B: (( yep )) 

275.96 278.37 A: save some money stuff like that you know 

278.10 279.04 B: (( yep )) 

278.41 279.22 A: um 

279.46 281.01 A: we generally will 

281.04 287.17 B: mhm i know i know it's gonna be hard to try to keep it separate but [laughter] we'll see how that goes 

281.59 282.82 A: on each other 

285.20 286.23 A: yeah 

286.87 295.67 A: yeah we really that was really our aim but i mean it just kinda happened that way at first you know 'cause of course me met and everything was separate and then 

292.43 293.15 B: (( mhm )) 

295.39 296.31 B: yeah 

295.71 297.03 A: you know um 

297.17 301.17 A: we dated for a while and stuff but um after that 

299.61 300.42 B: mhm 

301.97 302.93 A: um 

303.37 305.63 A: it just kinda all fell together so [laughter] 

304.95 309.36 B: yeah yeah i'm trying to think what else about a life partner you look for 

309.73 311.08 B: i think um 

311.48 314.22 B: i need i personally need to be very comfortable 

314.05 315.17 A: mhm 

314.36 319.66 B: with the person obviously um need to be able to talk about any and everything 

315.39 316.23 A: yeah 

319.92 321.07 B: um 

321.85 323.59 B: need to enjoy the same thing 

323.91 328.25 B: um like the same kinda movies and or go out you know like 

324.03 324.77 A: yeah 

326.24 327.21 A: mhm 

328.35 330.89 B: we personally love to travel 

330.63 331.87 A: mhm 

330.90 334.04 B: um he don't fly though which kinda sucks [laughter] 

333.50 335.11 A: oh that is hard 

334.57 340.83 B: yeah so we we drive a lot [laughter] but we do a lotta weekend trips and we can get away 

335.50 336.47 A: [laughter] 

337.45 338.74 A: mhm 

340.81 341.82 A: yeah 

340.92 341.95 B: um 

342.80 344.11 B: (( i'm trying to think what else )) 

345.23 346.38 B: also 

346.71 351.99 B: he helps out with the housework and stuff since we both work fulltime and that helps a lot too 

349.39 350.27 A: mhm 

351.28 352.92 A: oh that's great 

352.29 353.73 B: yeah that's nice 

353.45 361.17 A: that helps a lot especially when you're working fulltime and then you get home and you know you have to work at home too 

357.00 357.82 B: yeah 

360.95 361.86 B: (( yep )) 

361.97 362.74 A: [laughter] 

362.10 363.92 B: yeah and i think um 

364.04 372.54 B: i think support is another big thing if you support like if for your partner to support you no matter you know what you do or 

366.43 367.49 A: what's that 

368.03 369.61 A: oh yeah mhm 

372.62 382.83 B: uh i know my fiance's going back to school this fall and and i you know totally support him a hundred percent and help him out any way i can you know and i'll be helping him with 

375.86 376.71 A: mhm 

380.33 381.28 A: yeah 

382.98 384.87 B: schoolwork and everything else 

384.61 386.76 A: oh and that gets hard 

386.16 388.25 B: yeah and um 

388.36 398.37 B: and you know he like this past summer he wanted to learn how to play guitar so i was helping him that and i just think you know he supports me in a lotta ways and i think that's great yeah 

395.85 397.05 A: mhm 

398.01 401.46 A: yeah that's that's very important um 

401.66 402.54 B: (( hm yep )) 

402.03 403.93 A: support that's a good one 

404.15 405.22 A: um 

406.62 408.11 A: [lipsmack] yeah i can't really 

407.71 409.23 B: (( so [laughter] )) 

408.46 411.19 A: think of anything else um 

409.78 410.47 B: (( [mn] )) 

410.64 411.22 B: (( i'm )) 

412.28 413.47 A: (( [mn] )) 

413.34 415.59 B: (( trying to think of all the things i see in him )) 

417.23 419.96 B: i'm a person that needs a lot of attention 

420.29 423.45 A: yeah my husband is very very much that way 

420.75 421.59 B: and 

422.98 426.03 B: yeah and if i don't get it i i 

426.86 436.97 B: pout [laughter] i guess i get i get irritable or mad or sad and and i need a lot of attention and luckily he's the same way so 

427.78 429.92 A: yeah he yeah 

431.22 432.42 A: yeah 

436.24 437.67 A: well that's good 

437.13 444.99 B: not maybe not as much as me but um but we tend to give each other i think enough attention and 

438.58 439.69 A: yeah 

444.37 445.55 A: yeah 

445.39 449.07 B: so i think it it's just good to find somebody that's a lot like you 

448.97 461.27 A: yeah it is in in a lotta ways i mean it's it's very helpful i mean i i need attention too but like not as much as my husband and he was worried about you know when we had a baby you know 

460.84 462.14 B: mhm 

461.57 464.98 A: i'd be giving the baby so much attention [laughter] you know that i wouldn't 

463.79 464.80 B: yeah 

465.08 467.85 A: that i wouldn't need him anymore and stuff like that 

466.76 469.48 B: now your timing's probably torn between the two of them 

469.35 479.73 A: it is it's very hard because you know i work all day so i don't get to see her at all you know and she's at a sitter's all day and i feel like you know she's not gonna 

469.53 470.29 B: no 

474.94 475.93 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

480.25 489.35 A: know me she's gonna know the sitter better you know so i wanna spend every second with her while she's awake at night and then i'm so exhausted by the time she goes to bed 

485.19 486.30 B: that's hard 

489.00 490.06 B: mhm 

489.42 495.38 A: you know i don't have very much time for him and it's true um yeah 

492.31 493.40 B: yeah 

494.37 496.24 B: and then i'm sure in the weekends 

496.33 497.06 B: you're 

496.38 499.06 A: i wanna spend every second with her again you know 

498.50 499.69 B: yeah 

499.12 502.12 A: and and with him but 

502.38 509.01 A: i don't know i think i think um we're gonna work it out where i'm gonna stay home with her and and then i think 

509.05 522.66 A: you know and i told him i said i think you know our relationship will get better if that happens because then i won't mind you know leaving her at my mom's for the night and we can do something together you know and not feel guilty about it 

519.61 520.49 B: yeah 

522.05 524.92 B: and then you come into the finance thing [laughter] 

524.22 527.32 A: yeah and then we come into the financing thing so 

526.97 528.00 B: yeah 

527.37 542.07 A: there yeah but you know we really have never had fights over over finances you know we're both not very good with like saving money and stuff we both are spenders but [laughter] 

528.70 529.44 B: yeah 

539.22 540.26 B: mhm 

541.72 542.56 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

542.93 549.67 A: but somehow we never get into a fight about it i mean we get worried and you know about things but 

549.68 556.64 A: um you know if something unexpected comes up like the car transmission goes out or something you know [laughter] but um 

554.86 555.84 B: yeah 

557.52 560.47 A: really we're both pretty laid back so 

557.60 558.53 B: i know 

559.67 568.00 B: mhm so are we i know i know like you said you know you're splitting your time between your baby and your husband now [laughter] and this is gonna sound silly but i have two birds 

567.88 568.69 A: uh-huh 

568.59 578.21 B: so they need a lot of attention and when when i come home at night um my fiance gets up at like four thirty in the morning so we go to bed early at night 

571.32 572.69 A: [laughter] 

577.78 578.97 A: oh wow 

578.58 588.79 B: so by the time i get home at night i have like an hour to eat and watch a little bit of t. v. and spend time with the birds before i you know have to come in and spend time with 

588.96 594.83 B: the fiance and [laughter] it's like breaking the time up too so i know kinda what you mean but 

590.33 591.84 A: [laughter] 

595.70 598.55 B: i know it's funny 'cause they're birds but [laughter] 

597.52 599.89 A: (( mhm it's difficult well with with anything ))
