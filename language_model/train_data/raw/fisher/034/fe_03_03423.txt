19.69 25.26 A: oh well you'll have to visit so what do you think is important in a life partner 

21.27 22.42 B: yeah [laughter] 

25.51 26.55 B: um 

26.71 33.33 B: let's see i'm thinking actually um honesty probably 

33.53 34.68 B: um 

34.83 46.87 B: that that person be honest like of themselves or sincere they [mn] like they know themselves a while they they're confident um so in that sense but also honest with like me 

42.11 43.15 A: mhm 

46.54 47.61 A: mhm 

47.02 48.21 B: um 

47.65 49.70 A: do you have a life partner michelle 

50.11 53.97 B: i have a boyfriend that i know he's not a life partner yet [laughter] [laughter] 

52.98 57.51 A: [laughter] well let's see i been married for almost twenty years 

57.12 58.30 B: oh wow 

57.93 59.16 A: and um 

59.22 62.61 A: [lipsmack] i can tell you that honesty's important 

62.12 63.00 B: mhm 

62.76 67.38 A: from my perspective um if i didn't trust my wife completely 

67.62 73.92 A: uh and she didn't trust me i don't think we could've stayed married for nearly this long [mn] but uh 

72.38 73.25 B: yeah 

74.35 79.64 A: i i just take that as a given you know i'm not going to have a life partner that i can't be honest with 

76.78 78.24 B: mhm 

79.57 81.37 B: exactly yeah 

79.88 88.33 A: um but the one thing i was thinking about this actually the other day you know because i think about how lucky i am to have found somebody and what is it that made the person appropriate 

88.32 89.22 B: yeah 

88.82 93.26 A: for me it's sharing common values 

93.23 94.37 B: oh yes 

93.40 96.33 A: uh by that i mean specifically 

96.95 104.19 A: stuff about money is so important i- if you are somebody that really is into getting a lot of things or 

104.11 118.17 A: accumulating wealth or saving for your retirement or having a fancy car or something and your spouse isn't uh man that would be disaster and you wouldn't necessarily know it unless you were thinking about it 

111.16 112.10 B: mhm 

117.58 118.82 B: yeah 

118.75 123.53 A: i don't know if you and then the other values are just lifestyle things like is uh 

123.84 126.16 A: is neatness important 

125.58 127.00 B: mhm 

126.31 135.32 A: you know if you're somebody that just frankly doesn't give a damn about whether your place is clean and your spouse that's all she or he cares about that would be awful 

135.10 142.49 B: [laughter] yeah no i i i agree with you on both points um [lipsmack] i used to be in banking and 

141.86 143.02 A: oh really 

142.69 150.69 B: yeah and i actually left it [laughter] i uh and then i i went to work for a non profit 

149.97 151.03 A: what do you do 

150.76 159.75 B: and um well i i work at a technology non profit and we provide uh web based applications to other non profits they can use to raise money on line that kind of thing 

158.87 160.35 A: really 

159.66 165.97 B: yep so i'm doing that now but um the whole banking thing um i met a lot of people who 

166.97 177.27 B: their value's equivalent to [mn] like they had dollars signs in their eyes and that was not appealing so i didn't really click with anyone um then i went out from those circles so i agree with you there 

174.00 175.31 A: mhm 

177.53 179.80 B: (( and then also on your second point um )) 

180.03 191.28 B: i have a small [laughter] studio apartment um but for like half a year when my boyfriend was moving around and um he was looking for another place he lived with me and you know [mn] 

182.85 183.90 A: (( [laughter] )) 

189.66 190.57 A: uh-huh 

191.62 199.48 B: i mean we have different like we have different hours in the first place but we were we were able to get around that i'm more of a night owl 

199.26 200.28 A: oh really 

199.58 206.37 B: um but you know i put the lights down low and and he'd he'd be the type to sleep early and then wake up at like six in the morning 

206.07 207.46 A: (( uh-huh [laughter] )) 

207.03 210.16 B: um but you know we made adjustments there but 

209.85 211.02 A: what does he do 

210.38 216.47 B: like uh he's a computer developer called fusion developer so he works with computers 

214.74 215.69 A: (( oh )) 

216.36 217.17 A: neat 

216.50 227.21 B: but um yeah but uh [laughter] i i i'm more on the sloppy side but i i try to clean up and it we did- yeah it was kind of like the oscar felix thing for a little bit but 

222.03 223.44 A: [laughter] 

226.77 227.65 A: uh-huh 

227.49 241.43 B: we managed uh to work things out after a month or so but still with such a small space no matter just because you have stuff around it it it makes it seemed crap and um we drove each other crazy sometimes but i s- i see your point [laughter] 

239.98 243.08 A: do you have any pets in your one bedroom apartment 

242.92 247.29 B: um we had a cat actually oh we were taking care of a cat for a friend 

246.79 247.77 A: uh-huh 

247.16 260.21 B: um for maybe four or five uh months out of the time that he was here um living with me so there were three of us [laughter] in the apartment [laughter] but uh but that's [laughter] okay 'cause

429.02 430.21 A: [laughter] 

433.75 434.55 A: right

463.58 466.56 A: and i'm giving my hundred or two hundred dollars a year 

466.80 481.48 A: which used to be enormous but isn't enormous any more and i'm starting to feel guilty but on the other hand i think my private sc- i went to amherst college so like wellesley and they have an endowment that's so big they don't really need my money i should be giving it to umass or something where they really need it 

468.55 469.74 B: yeah 

471.06 472.06 B: (( no )) 

479.69 480.73 B: yeah

486.91 488.08 A: (( right )) 

492.40 498.24 A: right now back to life partners i realise that they don't really care what subject we [mn] have you done this before by the way

530.79 532.86 B: (( it's kind of a [lipsmack] )) 

532.87 545.10 B: or- organic site it started out in california this guy named craig made it and it's a very simple site but if you ever want to sell anything or [mn] you're looking for like uh something to buy or if you're looking for an apartment or 

544.93 550.97 B: like community activities people just post things on line and you can respond to them and and

570.15 583.17 B: yeah 'cause craig made it so it's craigslist craigslist dot org but um you know they're like i said started in san francisco and then it got more popular and actually i met the people who came out here to start it in boston about three years ago [mn] [lipsmack] 

582.65 583.75 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

583.47 587.27 B: and it's [mn] when it first got started 

587.58 599.90 B: it it's the kind of a site where you need to reach a critical mass before it can be helpful to anyone 'cause people have to keep contributing and posting and it's gotten to that point now um where more people are going on to it so it's definitely worth check-
