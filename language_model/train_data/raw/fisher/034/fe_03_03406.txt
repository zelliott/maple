18.81 21.96 B: yeah i just got engaged [laughter] 

21.43 26.52 A: since i'm working on getting divorced yes a very interesting one one thing you have to look for is 

23.83 27.15 B: oh [laughter] other side of the spectrum 

26.55 31.06 A: [laughter] yes you need to look for somebody that is willing to communicate 

27.66 28.79 B: [laughter] 

30.89 38.34 B: yes i agree i i actually think that i lucked out i'm i'm pretty young still i'm only twenty four and uh i've been with [lipsmack] 

38.59 41.01 B: my fiance for about five years now 

41.43 44.24 B: uh when i first met him i had no intentions of 

44.27 48.93 B: settling down or anything and um it sorta 

49.03 50.89 B: became such a match 

51.05 58.66 B: that you know i every check list that i had every every item on my check list he pretty much matched up to 

58.88 63.50 B: you know and i listened to everything from what my parents said to what friends said 

62.27 66.60 A: you listen your parents i have a nineteen year old she doesn't listen to me 

66.10 69.50 B: really you know at nineteen i didn't listen to my parents [laughter] 

66.71 67.52 A: yeah 

68.74 71.19 A: [laughter] that's what everybody keeps telling me 

70.59 78.45 B: and i know there's not much difference between nineteen and twenty four uh as in years but as in maturity i think it's a world 

78.01 79.64 A: it makes a difference 

79.06 81.09 B: of difference oh yeah my 

80.14 81.45 A: well i hope so 

81.50 88.85 B: my parents i've my parents actually um are divorced and his parents are divorced and [lipsmack] 

89.30 90.27 B: um 

90.55 100.33 B: you know we thought that was going to be you know everyone said oh that's a problem you shouldn't be with somebody who who has divorced parents you know it raises the level of divorce and everything 

100.38 102.20 B: and i said no 'cause you know 

102.53 106.54 B: basically [sigh] if you're exactly right if you communicate 

106.59 107.68 B: and you get every 

106.73 120.18 A: that's it that is the key everything else you can work on but [laughter] you've gotta be able to communicate you know if you aren't willing to speak your piece and have it be heard and vice versa 

112.93 113.99 B: yeah 

119.82 120.86 B: mhm 

120.25 131.30 A: then it's just not going to work out no matter no matter what i mean somebody's going to be unhappy and there's always give and take i mean everybody has to give a little bit and take a little bit 

122.36 123.67 B: exactly 

130.81 133.41 B: mhm one of the reasons why i actually 

133.43 134.51 B: uh 

134.90 136.39 B: you know pretty much 

136.70 145.01 B: kept my focus on on him and not on anybody else was because of the fact that none of my other boyfriends had ever uh questioned me 

145.48 159.26 B: on anything or told me when i was wrong or told me when i was right um they just sort of you know all never well when i was right they were always oh okay yeah but they never challenged me at all and and i think the fact that that he 

159.36 162.90 B: my fiance jason is able was able to to do that 

163.02 167.08 B: was something that i was shocked about i thought you know usually 

167.23 169.41 B: guys when i first met him i was nineteen 

169.48 172.65 B: and usually you know men at that age usually don't 

173.14 176.66 B: they either are stubborn or they don't question at all [laughter] 

176.13 177.92 A: yeah well i think it's just that 

178.07 187.08 A: you know i think that there's a certain amount of shyness or unsurety in everybody and i think that that holds back their willingness to 

182.45 183.18 B: oh 

187.15 194.54 A: question what you think feel say react and you know 'cause it's a a fear of rejection 

190.39 191.33 B: right 

194.28 197.66 B: right and he he was just very sure of himself without being uh 

197.87 200.56 B: uh too arrogant [laughter] 

199.91 201.24 A: right 

200.57 202.75 B: you know and that that i liked but 

202.80 210.88 B: uh you know i listened to my parents and my sister even says you know men do not even walk upright until the age of probably twenty five 

211.17 212.73 A: [laughter] 

211.25 214.63 B: (( she says [laughter] that's what he says to me she's )) 

213.53 219.61 A: i think that yeah i i mean i think everybody matures at a different level and you know i i you know i 

217.08 218.15 B: yeah 

220.14 224.78 A: i don't know when i got married my h- husband was um 

226.29 231.71 A: twenty eight or twenty nine and he still is not mature 

228.32 229.35 B: mhm 

231.72 240.27 A: you know [laughter] he still does not have you know what it need- what you need what you need to have to make something work you know 

232.38 233.71 B: (( [laughter] yep )) 

239.70 241.03 B: right 

240.29 243.57 A: um he's you know he's he's like uh 

243.62 248.25 A: he's the old fashioned type as far as the man's always right 

248.09 252.99 B: my father was that way for a little while i mean my father vacillates i i under- 

251.80 263.81 A: but well yeah but a lotta times when you when you're that way then you also feel like the woman shouldn't work the woman should raise the children well he didn't feel that i mean it was you know he took all the negatives from everything 

261.26 262.25 B: [laughter] 

263.75 264.68 B: well 

263.88 272.08 A: and and so so you know it was like there wasn't even any bonus because when i talked to my mother she's well you know your dad was that way but yeah 

272.01 273.51 B: that was a different time 

272.83 285.47 A: you know my dad did not he wanted you to stay home and take care of the house okay that was that's one thing but to go to work and then come home and take care of the house that's a completely different story [laughter] 

278.17 279.20 B: right 

283.18 284.11 B: (( ex- )) 

284.47 296.60 B: that's exactly how i feel i mean i think i have a good thing my fiance and i actually i run one business with my father and then my fiance runs another business and i help him out with his business so we both work from home 

296.58 309.53 B: which is is a good thing and you know he his mother and his grandmother worked all their lives and he has no issues about that but my fath- my father does though 

306.57 308.41 A: and that's that's fine 

310.04 312.32 A: your father doesn't feel you should work 

312.00 323.69 B: oh no he feels i should work but he you know when when my mother and he were together it was it was uh that she could work that's fine that was no no issue but again when he came home he wanted dinner made 

322.94 326.84 A: right they want the dinner on the table want ya to yeah yeah 

325.08 326.19 B: mhm 

326.92 336.00 A: chief cooker yeah and that that is but that's you gotta be able to talk about it ahead of time 'cause if you can't talk about it ahead of time you're never gonna be able to talk about it 

336.13 336.98 B: yeah 

336.18 338.04 A: you know later on 

337.60 341.92 B: well i also blame that on on whoever whoever has raised that boy 

342.45 345.95 B: you know whoever raised my my grandmother who raised my father 

345.13 348.86 A: i i don't know because un- unless i mean 

349.02 351.19 A: i'd have to say my mother in 

351.36 352.20 A: (( in )) 

352.28 355.62 A: i got along better with my mother in law than i did my husband 

355.54 359.03 B: [lipsmack] right but but did did she set the example though 

356.25 357.66 A: [laughter] 

359.16 360.21 B: of 

360.05 365.77 A: yeah yes she did she i mean she set the ex- no she set a great example 

361.03 361.94 B: yeah 

364.51 366.44 B: oh she set a great example 

365.81 368.22 A: yeah i mean you know she uh 

369.28 370.53 A: you know she 

370.94 376.42 A: said that she would rather not work and so she stayed home and she raised the kids and you know 

376.50 383.82 A: and so no i mean and that was that's exactly what what what happened but it was like completely different 

376.52 377.62 B: oh right 

383.93 396.80 A: with um when we were you know together because there was always you know it was always that issue it was like you have to have your own money i mean you know you have to have your own way to support yourself 

387.63 388.67 B: yeah 

396.19 397.29 B: right 

396.86 404.78 A: um don't come to me if you know if you want uh if you want to buy this then don't come to me and ask me for money 

404.88 405.90 A: um 

405.67 406.53 B: huh 

406.19 415.01 A: well you know it's like if i stay home [laughter] if i do all you know if i do everything else that you want me to do then where am i going to go to for the money 

409.66 410.82 B: yeah [laughter] 

414.26 428.91 B: and you know what i think in my eyes that's a that's a very fair trade offer i mean i i told my fiance uh you know a few years ago when we were getting really serious i said just so you know my values are that you know i don't i believe in completely working and while i'm working that's fine 

429.07 434.95 B: but i do believe that a woman should stay home if they can with the children from age one to about three 

434.51 435.48 A: mhm 

435.31 438.85 B: and i said so just so you know this is where i'm at 

439.03 444.80 B: and this is what i feel and he said hey that's an equal trade off raising kids is harder than working any day of the week 

445.98 448.95 B: and once he once he said that i thought okay 

446.01 448.23 A: well it sounds sounds like 

449.47 452.01 A: yeah it sounds like you have um 

452.54 454.26 A: you know you've met a a 

454.68 456.58 A: a great guy so 

455.70 467.76 B: yeah we hope so [laughter] i mean di- divorce i i told him is not a word in my vocabulary but on the other hand you know life happens and i've seen it from my parents and his parents 

457.82 458.70 A: (( [laughter] )) 

467.93 469.62 B: that life happens yeah 

469.86 477.85 A: right but you have to work at it you have to constantly once you see yourself drifting apart you have to work at it you have to you know you have to 

477.97 482.89 A: um i mean like his his and your um 

483.43 484.35 A: um 

484.97 493.54 A: appetites are going to change and and and different kinds of things and you have to be willing to cut you know to meet somebody halfway 

486.52 487.67 B: oh yeah 

493.26 494.42 B: right i mean 

493.76 496.76 A: and so and he has to be able to too 

495.75 498.99 B: right luckily you know we've grown together 

499.01 512.70 B: in the past five years but you know there have been times when i've seen okay you know uh you know right now i have my mind set in a different place right now he has his mind set in a different place and you know you kinda worry uh-oh 

512.68 515.76 B: is this going to you know are we going to drift apart 

515.86 523.65 B: from this and i think the only thing that really stopped it was to as you said communicate and just say hey this is where i am 

524.19 525.64 B: you can with me 

526.06 532.86 B: or you can go your own way and and everything is okay as long as we talk about it and make sure you know where you are 

530.61 537.88 A: yeah and as long as you're willing to let the other person go in the direction they want to go in i mean you know somebody may wanna 

535.71 536.62 B: right 

538.34 539.22 A: (( you know )) 

539.25 546.35 A: somebody may wanna pursue a different career that that the other person's not quite interested can't take an interest in and that's okay 

545.88 547.00 B: yeah 

546.37 556.31 A: as long as they understand your need to do that and with that a you know say okay well you know i've been thinking about doing this or i'd like to try to this 

551.60 552.51 B: right 

556.50 558.49 A: so you know we're not going to be 

558.58 565.14 A: uh discussing the business because you're going to be [laughter] in something else you know and that's okay yeah 

562.57 564.25 B: right exactly 

564.50 569.91 B: oh yeah he i mean when i first met him he was working at a nightclub and i never ever asked him 

570.00 580.20 B: [lipsmack] not to work at a nightclub anymore um you know i never pressured him or anything about it and one day he came to me he said do you know what i don't like working in the nightclub i don't like getting home at one a. m. 

580.52 583.95 B: he said i i think that that's just not right and uh 

584.21 588.87 B: i'm gonna you know pursue go more with uh computer related things and i said okay 

589.45 597.01 B: you know that's that's fine if that's what you'd like to do by all means and uh i had told him that i wanted to go back to school and he said hey 

591.79 592.71 A: right 

597.04 599.89 B: okay well i'm you know i have a good job now i'm working
