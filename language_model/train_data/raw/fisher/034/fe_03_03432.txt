84.42 88.29 A: yeah so uh if there's no friendship well

94.28 96.57 A: yeah trust definitely is [laughter] 

97.98 110.13 B: you definitely gotta have that one of the things that i feel is probably or should be on the list probably is not when you first somebody because you get entangled with um 

110.72 117.04 B: [sigh] i wanna say infatuation or lust and you get it confused with the love 

114.35 115.29 A: okay

149.08 150.26 B: and then 

151.15 153.19 B: the sex will come after that 

153.42 158.57 A: yeah i think so too well for us women but for for men i think the sex is 

158.84 162.24 B: [laughter] 

159.30 162.09 A: [laughter] the most important thing 

162.60 166.43 B: i think you're probably right but i mean [cough] 

167.09 174.05 B: you know they always say the grass is greener on the other side but sometimes once they get there it's pretty brown [laughter] 

174.13 175.71 A: well you 

175.76 188.16 A: you have to walk in someone else's shoes uh before you can judge because it's yeah like you say it seems green on the other side but uh it's never as green as it looks like 

188.45 190.16 B: you're exactly right 

189.47 195.74 A: yeah when you go there and uh you look there oh wow it's not green [laughter] 

194.49 197.31 B: well and the thing of it is you you know

213.59 214.30 A: mhm 

214.89 221.31 A: no no yeah yeah that's true and uh 

221.52 222.80 A: no um

226.04 227.27 B: [laughter] 

229.43 234.69 A: it's wow you you begin to see things that you didn't see before 

234.83 243.88 A: and uh you have to accept you know those things so when you have a good friendship with your friend 

234.87 236.12 B: (( mhm true )) 

243.99 251.45 A: and uh it's easier to accept all those little things and um 

252.23 254.18 A: you know in life sometimes you 

254.39 260.66 A: i don't know me um twenty five years i'm with the same man and sometimes it's 

260.82 264.67 A: it's really great and it's like a wave and it's going 

264.80 275.83 A: down and it's going up and down and up even after twenty five years so the friendship is there so that's why it's still there and 

269.00 269.91 B: right 

275.22 279.51 B: and and that's true i mean i see so many times that uh 

279.48 293.92 B: um young women will pretend to be something they're not you know or try to be perfect you know for their and i say why are you doing that because once you make a mistake then you're ruined in his eyes if you portray a perfect 

286.34 287.50 A: yeah 

293.86 295.67 B: you know image 

295.39 296.35 A: mhm 

296.08 297.93 B: you know be yourself 

297.62 301.35 A: yeah because they want to attract the other one 

298.10 299.13 B: and 

301.41 308.64 A: and uh they are not uh self confident enough to act the way they are 

308.85 315.43 A: so they they they uh they pretend they are someone else because they are not confident 

313.14 314.05 B: right 

315.46 321.48 A: on uh what they are so uh self confidence is important too 

317.47 318.46 B: right 

321.38 327.53 B: i i agree if they are not comfortable with their self or they do not have um 

327.75 335.17 B: the ability to be comfortable with yourself they can't be comfortable with somebody else you know with who they're who they are 

329.18 330.18 A: mhm 

331.45 334.31 A: yeah 

335.30 339.56 B: so i agree i mean all of those are great qualities you know

374.48 388.15 A: i have some secrets from my husband he doesn't know everything in my life and i'm sure i don't i don't know everything in his life and i don't want to know every detail of his life because things you like to keep for yourself 

387.71 388.65 B: right 

388.16 390.40 A: but when you share 

391.32 392.77 A: you have to be true

399.79 402.59 B: you know maintain an honest relationship 

401.97 402.94 A: yeah 

402.83 405.53 B: because if the lying starts you know 

404.57 405.77 A: mhm 

405.71 409.21 B: it it just it shuts down the relationship process 

409.02 414.34 A: mhm so there's honesty and uh friendship and uh 

413.66 415.52 B: trust 

414.54 416.95 A: trust and uh 

416.17 417.37 B: security 

417.37 418.92 A: oh yeah 

419.21 430.84 A: we need that the women [laughter] we need security for a man i think it's sex and for a woman it's uh security [laughter] that's what we need yeah 

421.08 422.39 B: [laughter] 

427.14 428.11 B: right 

429.37 433.20 B: well we need to be able to be you know 

433.79 436.13 B: cuddled and touched without 

436.50 444.48 B: going to that ultimate intimacy you know whereas that's enough to satisfy us but 

439.74 440.71 A: mhm 

444.51 448.09 B: [laughter] a man once once the touching starts 

448.14 449.48 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

449.21 450.49 B: (( [mn] )) 

450.55 451.61 A: yeah 

450.79 452.79 B: way after that i suppose 

452.80 453.66 A: (( mm )) 

453.17 459.51 B: but i was with my husband uh he he passed away he passed away in nineteen ninety nine 

459.22 460.02 A: oh 

459.58 462.74 B: but we were together i think eighteen years at that time 

462.87 463.93 A: okay 

464.03 465.62 B: so it was quite a while 

464.39 466.36 A: so that's a long time huh 

465.99 467.12 B: yeah 

467.18 469.57 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

467.78 470.63 B: it is [laughter] it seems like forever 

470.68 472.79 B: but uh you know 

472.91 478.87 B: that's just the way it goes i mean that's part of life's ups and downs and and uh 

477.23 478.57 A: mhm 

479.22 481.56 B: i agree you know even after 

482.32 485.92 B: that many years we still had arguments 

486.00 487.16 A: oh yeah 

487.00 487.91 B: (( you know )) 

487.70 489.11 A: oh sure because 

489.29 492.27 A: you it could not be perfect 

492.30 493.01 B: (( [noise] )) 

492.78 497.32 A: and uh you have arguments and uh it's it's normal 

497.85 500.34 A: because if you don't have arguments 

500.59 503.97 A: i think it's because you uh 

504.35 508.61 A: [lipsmack] don't always express what you really feel 

508.24 509.34 B: could be 

509.04 510.81 A: because you cannot 

511.01 513.58 A: always always 

513.62 515.98 A: think like the other one 

516.54 518.93 A: you know some some things 

519.74 527.32 A: will happen and uh you will have an argument you you don't always see um the same thing 

522.93 523.82 B: right 

528.15 537.24 A: i i listen to someone speaking and my husband understands something and me i understand something else 

536.04 539.90 B: well that that goes into that big word of perception 

539.45 541.17 A: yeah 

540.06 551.41 B: you know and it's really interesting 'cause i i also do a. m. t. work and we had a whole class on perception what one person perceives another person will perceive something different 

547.17 548.05 A: uh-huh 

551.09 552.00 A: yeah 

551.58 554.04 B: but uh it it's 

552.93 561.36 A: so something happens and you you see it one way and he sees it another another way and very soon you can have an argument 

561.80 562.83 A: based on 

562.00 565.92 B: ab- absolutely but you can be some intimate you know 

563.43 564.28 A: (( based on )) 

566.39 571.82 B: not physically but emotionally intimate with each other that you know what the other one's thinking 

567.76 570.43 A: (( it mhm )) 

571.40 572.76 A: oh yeah 

572.16 581.73 B: you know because that happened a lot with me and my husband i mean he would be sitting there thinking especially with it dealt with a kid and i'll look at him and i say i know what you're thinking 

574.16 576.25 A: yeah uh-huh 

581.64 582.66 A: mhm 

582.20 585.60 B: and he'll tell say what and i'd tell him [laughter] and he'd said you're right 

585.14 587.33 A: yeah oh yeah 

586.66 588.63 B: so you know that's 

588.78 592.75 B: and that's part of the the building of the relationship being able to 

592.83 593.81 B: um 

593.93 599.89 B: to trust and and uh be secure with who you are and who your partner is
