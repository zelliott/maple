24.22 25.57 A: how 'bout yourself 

24.97 31.12 B: i'm uh an artist i'm we're we're probably uh not too far from each other i'm outside of d. c.

34.56 39.34 B: oh yeah that's out on the eastern little bit further on the eastern shore very nice out there 

38.78 41.44 A: yeah it's pretty sweet i'm been up there a couple of 

40.08 45.43 B: so are you one of one of the participants in this study or this is my first call 

43.33 44.43 A: (( times ah )) 

44.91 46.69 A: yeah mine too actually 

46.15 47.46 B: (( oh okay )) 

46.76 47.80 A: [laughter] 

47.52 48.46 B: cool 

48.04 52.54 A: do do they did you get the message brief about uh the wage increase 

51.99 55.78 B: yes i did and i guess we're supposed to talk about that 

52.79 53.62 A: okay 

55.15 57.29 A: yeah [laughter] 

56.56 61.50 B: i i didn't hear anything about the taping beginning i guess it has though huh 

60.98 63.36 A: oh um you know i'm not even really sure 

62.88 64.28 B: i'm not either 

64.34 67.98 B: well let's go from here how do you feel about it 

65.89 66.80 A: okay 

67.77 68.82 A: um 

68.85 72.94 A: i don't know i think it i didn't even know it was how much they said five fifteen 

72.59 83.25 B: ah well i think that they should definitely uh increase the the minimum wage i think that people can't make a living any other way they're better off going on welfare than 

83.36 86.73 B: earning [laughter] five fifteen or less an hour 

84.38 85.44 A: oh yeah 

86.37 91.98 A: oh yeah i believe that i i would agree with that i mean it's i couldn't believe when she said it was only five something i mean i'm 

91.29 92.56 B: exactly 

92.18 99.13 A: i remember when i was working in some restaurants it was like four seventy five and not it just always seems to be behind the times 

95.87 97.15 B: right 

98.45 99.87 B: it's slavery 

99.64 100.45 A: mhm 

100.22 103.86 B: i think that uh the minimum wage should be ten dollars an hour 

103.55 112.33 A: i know that's pretty much what all the jobs i'm working at [laughter] like part time offer right now so it almost feels like they like you're right on on that it should probably be ten dollars anyway 

106.38 107.33 B: really 

110.20 111.27 B: yeah 

111.87 121.89 B: yeah i just don't understand what their thinking is they're trying to keep the working class i guess poor i don't know why i guess it's so that the upper classes can remain rich 

121.66 124.96 A: ah [mn] that's probably one possibility 

124.37 125.67 B: yeah 

125.02 133.01 A: i just it's ridiculous though you know i mean how is anyone supposed to really honestly make it on like five dollars an hour 

129.61 130.75 B: they can't 

132.38 137.61 B: they can't they ha- would have to have you know even a student that's just spending money 

137.08 138.40 A: mhm 

137.76 143.43 B: they would have to have either a second job or some form of other income 

143.35 154.13 B: if it's a student i guess it would be grants or scholarships or money from your parents i just don't think it's right in this day and age in this [sigh] wealthy wealthy country that we're in 

143.45 144.45 A: right 

153.81 161.33 A: exactly especially with the healthcare costs are going up and everything else it's like school i i don't know but our school is going up 

156.77 157.74 B: right 

160.73 162.65 B: what's the school again that you're in 

162.24 163.30 A: v._c._u. 

163.51 164.94 B: (( ah vir- )) 

164.22 166.19 A: virginia commonwealth university 

165.55 167.07 B: where is that located 

167.00 168.94 A: uh right in richmond 

168.43 172.64 B: oh okay you're in richmond [lipsmack] and what are you majoring in 

169.88 171.12 A: mhm 

172.29 173.93 A: uh radiography 

173.95 175.49 B: very good 

174.88 179.53 A: yeah i took a couple of years off but uh you know once i got decided on what i was gonna do 

179.39 182.24 B: wonderful so you'll be reading um 

179.93 180.89 A: yeah 

182.46 184.07 B: you'll be a technician 

183.99 190.46 A: uh yeah i'll be uh hopefully i'll be going into m._r._i. which is yeah magnetic resonance imaging 

187.40 188.63 B: good for you 

189.84 195.85 B: yes that's wonderful now now you won't have to worry about a minimum wage with that that's for sure 

191.91 192.85 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

194.86 199.31 A: e- exactly that's one of the reasons i'm just like i'm over it [laughter] 

196.09 197.65 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

198.53 200.94 B: yes that's great 

200.83 202.47 A: and uh but um 

202.61 209.50 A: i don't know that's the what would that break down for a day like about fifty bucks a day if they worked ten hours 

207.61 214.65 B: well that would be well that would be ten hours and i guess it's an eight hour day so uh eight times it's uh 

212.07 213.31 A: (( for the most part )) 

214.69 222.70 A: what kind of jobs are even available that you i mean w- i wonder where people what kind of jobs people would even yeah i guess that's about it fast food 

218.37 219.49 B: mcdonald's 

220.92 222.27 B: fast food 

222.49 224.84 B: fast food um 

224.41 225.72 A: that's a shame 

225.12 228.35 B: yeah you know it's very uh uh 

227.43 231.01 A: especially since each meal there costs about five dollars now 

230.31 239.46 B: that's right and i wonder what the manual laborers uh i guess that would fall under the mini- minimum wage also can you imagine out cutting grass or 

239.54 241.24 A: digging trenches 

240.62 243.45 B: yeah for five dollars and fifteen cents an hour 

243.13 244.32 A: ah that 

243.59 246.76 B: i don't know a- and that's an increase [laughter] 

246.13 254.02 A: yeah i think if there was more initiative to have 'em do all the stuff probably be a lot less uh crime too if they had more money 

251.88 253.12 B: that's true 

253.43 258.26 B: that's another very valid thought absolutely [sigh] so 

258.50 264.68 B: i don't know what more we can say on this and i really don't know how this works i'm looking at the email as we speak 

264.08 269.88 A: oh okay yeah my i i heard it from a friend and uh they got to talk about pets so [laughter] i was like pets mm 

264.76 265.76 B: that i re- 

268.64 275.48 B: yeah i saw that one also but i didn't know how valid this thing was did you see it on craig's list by chance 

275.64 277.49 B: where did you find out about it 

275.67 276.70 A: um 

276.87 279.97 A: uh actually i went online and found it on there too 

279.55 280.69 B: you did 

280.17 281.38 A: mhm 

280.75 290.62 B: there's um a organization online called craig's list w. w. w. dot c. r. a. i. g. s. l. i. s. t. dot com 

286.02 286.90 A: (( oh really )) 

290.39 291.55 A: (( okay mhm )) 

290.93 297.73 B: and uh it's all over the country and it has specified areas like washington new york philadelphia 

297.77 300.72 B: um san francisco et cetera 

300.84 313.11 B: and um somebody had posted [lipsmack] uh about this study but they put their code number in and failed to explain that you fill out the form and then you get your own p._i._n. number 

312.80 313.83 A: right 

313.11 318.22 B: so i thought it was a scam very honestly but then they emailed me back and explained 

318.27 325.22 B: how this works so i've just received the email back from the fisher project 

325.30 328.41 B: and i'm looking to see it says it's a ten minute 

329.77 334.09 B: uh phone call is the is the length and you speak for 

333.58 334.88 A: (( uh-huh about eight minutes )) 

334.28 341.62 B: eight minutes right um but i i don't know it doesn't say whether they tell you when the time is up or not 

340.96 347.50 A: yeah oh yeah it there'll be a a voice will come on and um i think we'll get like a couple of minutes to say goodbye so 

343.27 344.35 B: okay 

346.34 348.33 B: right okay 

348.19 360.67 A: but uh have you gotten any uh have you seen any other emails about um like credit reports uh i got one i work for penrico county with m. h. and m. r. mental mental retardation [cough] and um 

355.66 356.53 B: uh-huh 

358.75 359.63 B: uh-huh 

361.06 367.72 A: i mean their minimum wage is like ten dollars an hour there yeah that's that's one of the reasons i'm saying that's why i get paid ten dollars 

363.60 364.93 B: is it really 

367.94 370.61 A: that's what they start everyone off at there 

370.01 374.60 B: yeah but that's that's their pay it's not by federal regulation 

374.16 375.63 A: right right 

374.68 385.91 B: um it's just the people who wanna stick to you know stick it to people and say well the minimum i have to pay you is five fifteen it just so happens your folks 

385.90 391.73 B: are um recognize that they can't get any ki- any kind of quality for less than ten dollars an hour 

386.91 388.80 A: mm mm nice enough [laughter] 

391.37 400.11 A: right i mean and all i really do is relief stuff i just kind of go and fill in for people that are regular workers that uh need a day off or can't make it 

398.47 399.53 B: i see 

400.02 402.99 B: yeah what county is that 

400.90 401.77 A: so 

402.38 403.56 A: penrico 

403.19 405.86 B: and that's um the richmond area 

405.27 409.32 A: yes yeah it's um i think it's just north of richmond 

408.70 410.53 B: what about your your 

410.54 412.56 B: friends and um 

412.80 413.93 B: um 

414.14 422.53 B: you know like the other guys that you go to school with i mean what do they do do they also receive uh do they do they have part time jobs 

421.97 424.21 A: [mn] uh yeah a lot of them do 

424.55 428.27 B: and do they get paid or do they get minimum wage 

428.18 436.50 A: uh i think all of 'em make uh range between like around seven to probably twelve dollars in most cases mhm 

435.82 437.06 B: really 

437.61 440.55 B: so you don't know anybody that's earning minimum wage 

439.96 452.67 A: and no the only time i can remember ever making the the minimum wage was i worked for a parking company and that was just putting to like you know just handing out the tickets to people for events like ballgames or stuff like that [sigh] 

445.60 446.57 B: mhm 

451.72 452.48 B: (( mm )) 

452.82 460.00 A: i did that for a short while 'cause the hours were really good you'd work like a couple of hours here then you could come back later and work a couple more hours 

459.36 463.89 B: you mean like at uh parking garages or at like sporting events 

463.25 475.47 A: um it like for a parking service company but they they do they have like uh certain lots that they won bids on to get to to get the use of and make money on 

464.14 465.20 B: (( like s- )) 

466.42 467.29 B: uh-huh 

473.82 474.73 B: uh-huh 

475.07 475.95 B: (( all right )) 

475.84 480.75 A: and uh yeah they were they were pretty hard they they only paid the minimum wage mhm 

480.12 481.09 B: really 

481.78 490.26 A: that's why i didn't do that very long but only it was really good in the beginning with school because i could just basically go sit on the lot with my books and read them 

483.39 484.32 B: yeah 

489.48 490.57 B: that's right 

490.38 492.65 A: [sigh] that was a that was pretty nice 

490.86 491.74 B: yeah 

492.02 499.52 B: yeah well that's you know that's sorta like easy money but uh and i and i guess that's what minimum wage is for is to um 

494.45 495.40 A: yeah 

497.87 499.03 A: i guess [noise] 

499.77 502.81 B: to sort of invite folks who 

502.96 509.10 B: you know want it somewhat easy but then what about people who really depend on that money 

508.68 514.53 A: mm i know i guess uh they must be uh they must just give enough of that out though i gue- you know 

514.95 520.23 A: uh with um especially with the adults with m. h. and m. r. a lot of them get a 

521.24 526.32 A: lot of money from the government for uh jeeze what is the name of it 

522.78 523.85 B: yeah 

524.63 527.85 B: well for [mn] soc- it's uh s. s. i. 

527.43 530.59 A: soc- uh not social security but uh wh- 

529.78 531.75 B: supplementary security income 

531.18 534.94 A: yeah a lot of 'em get that sort of thing but they all also have jobs 

535.15 539.92 A: where they i guess they would uh be considered minimum wage in some cases [noise] 

539.19 545.10 B: well it depends and what happens with s. s. i. is that they um deduct 

545.21 548.92 B: you're only allowed to make so much before they start deducting 

546.96 547.84 A: yeah 

548.38 559.11 A: i think that might be one of the good things maybe that's one good thing about the minimum wage only being five maybe it keeps them under a certain level so that they can continue to get their uh other kinds of aid that they need mhm mhm 

555.00 555.83 B: i 

558.53 569.27 B: i guess i wouldn't i wouldn't look at it that way necessarily though i mean if somebody who is disabled goes and gets a part time job and say they e- earn ten dollars an hour 

569.28 581.90 B: then uh you know the social security administration if they're receiving s. s. i. i think it's for every two dollars that you earn they take a dollar they deduct a dollar off of your monthly st- amount 

578.07 579.00 A: (( oh really )) 

581.94 583.92 B: i think that's the way it works 

584.13 591.40 B: uh over over a certain number you're al- allowed to earn a very limited amount and then over that amount they start 

584.16 585.05 A: (( huh uh yeah )) 

588.88 589.88 A: mhm 

591.54 594.57 B: cutting back on the amount that they send you monthly 

592.90 599.90 A: mhm yeah 'cause are some of the people that are like some of the clients at our location they they're some of them are really
