18.71 30.07 A: um okay so last night's topic was pets and that's a nice uh [laughter] yeah so it's kind of funny that they go from pets and now we're supposed to talk about um life partners 

22.85 23.86 B: pets 

29.49 31.52 B: [noise] yeah that's one extreme to the other 

31.36 33.73 A: (( exactly [laughter] )) 

32.20 35.19 B: well i guess if you have a life partner as a pet i don't know 

34.56 43.13 A: exactly yes it's kind a interesting so uh at at least they said at first life partners but now it's um what do we look for in in a life partner 

43.26 44.98 B: um 

45.16 49.19 B: i don't know i guess uh compatibility 

49.22 58.61 A: yeah i think i think that would work um it's funny because i actually never um really had a a serious girlfriend at all until uh until about nine months ago 

56.20 56.96 B: no 

58.43 64.47 A: um and actually i'm i'm living with her now and and it's you know i just graduated from college about uh 

64.66 75.60 A: it- it's going on a year now and it's just you know so funny because for the longest time it was like i wasn't looking at all you know and finally uh and finally that chemistry like [mn] starting to settle down a little bit 

72.01 73.19 B: so you're like 

75.22 77.41 B: are you like twenty two or something 

76.78 78.20 A: uh twenty three yeah 

77.59 81.75 B: twenty three so you just didn't have any [mn] 

78.47 79.47 A: yeah 

81.86 84.16 B: like serious relationships 

83.24 91.53 A: yeah i mean like you know my my whole [mn] interpretation of college for four years was you know go out and have fun [laughter] 

89.11 90.02 B: sure 

90.20 96.05 B: yeah what did you say you graduate college and then met someone and then gee you're living together after nine months 

93.60 95.14 A: yeah we're actually 

95.72 104.39 A: yeah it was actually really strange we um we met out in wisconsin uh because we were both working on a political campaign out there and um 

99.26 100.24 B: (( oh okay )) 

104.28 113.67 A: [lipsmack] then i think you know we were kind of like [mn] you know we started seeing each other uh [mn] there and we and we lived together out there for a little while um 

112.68 113.24 B: (( [mn] )) 

113.47 122.15 A: and then we came out to d. c. washington d. c. in january and you know got an apartment and so we've been here now for uh going on four months 

121.50 123.13 B: so you're in d. c. right now 

122.94 124.89 A: yeah i am washington d. c. 

124.37 125.80 B: oh i'm in new york city 

125.74 130.53 A: oh wow okay yeah last night i was talking to some um [lipsmack] some kid from uh new jersey 

130.28 131.68 B: (( oh really )) 

131.03 139.39 A: so yeah they they spray you all over the place but uh yeah i mean i guess you know what i i look for at least um 

137.12 145.58 B: well i'm forty one and i've been dating a or i mean i've been living and [mn] sharing my life with someone for four years now and we just had a baby but we haven't married 

145.09 146.85 A: [mn] oh wow uh-huh 

146.34 150.27 B: so uh i mean i was pretty much single and just having 

150.43 154.46 B: uh off and on relationships for about you know a number of years and then 

154.75 164.77 B: uh separating and moving on and here i'm i met someone about four years ago and we've been together since but she had a child from a previous marriage 

161.24 162.37 A: mhm 

164.66 165.51 A: uh-huh 

164.85 167.32 B: who i pretty much raised 

167.27 168.26 A: oh wow 

167.59 170.41 B: so i kind of went from a [mn] you know 

170.49 172.68 B: dating to an instant family 

172.37 175.81 A: right right well that's definitely a change um 

174.50 179.11 B: and i have a a new born uh three weeks old sitting on my chest right now 

178.87 183.17 A: (( oh [laughter] you got your h- you got your hands full )) 

180.71 181.84 B: so [laughter] 

182.72 184.09 B: yeah 

183.69 185.99 A: [laughter] 

184.48 194.83 B: so i think compatibility is a [laughter] is certainly a factor but uh i mean i i don't know [mn] what else a [mn] life partner would require you know 

188.88 190.81 A: mm 

194.74 196.31 A: yeah exactly 

195.21 198.00 B: certainly compatibility did you have any uh 

196.86 198.23 A: (( yeah )) 

198.38 199.38 B: i mean is it 

198.42 205.07 A: i mean as i like to say you know it it's someone who can put up with me you know for uh for an extended period of time 

202.39 204.05 B: [laughter] 

204.47 207.17 B: (( i think that's tolera- tolerability )) 

206.95 211.28 A: yeah exactly tolerance is uh definitely [mn] an important trait 

207.25 208.75 B: [laughter] 

209.13 218.42 B: [laughter] yeah so wh- what did you say about pets last night i mean [mn] at the end of the ten minutes talk you just kind of give a comments and that's it 

215.33 215.89 A: (( [mn] )) 

217.63 232.50 A: it's it's so funny because they they'll just say you know at the um end of uh you know [mn] it will say ten minutes has passed you now have thirty seconds to wrap things up and you know even before i could say goodbye to the guy you know that was it you know the end of it yeah yeah 

229.48 230.78 B: that's bizarre 

231.62 238.13 B: so what is uh where did you find out about this site or this this [mn] how did you get on this list that that they call you 

238.04 241.31 A: um it's really funny actually have you ever heard of craigslist 

240.71 244.14 B: yeah i that's what i was going to say i got it on craigslist in new york 

243.94 257.88 A: yeah yeah so um we have one of them in d. c. and uh so i uh found it on there and you know went through the whole procedure and i had done some studies before through harvard business school um they kind of do the same kind of stuff and 

256.62 258.20 B: and my wife went to harvard 

258.31 259.94 A: [lipsmack] what's that oh really 

259.37 261.80 B: yeah what year were you there oh 

259.99 260.91 A: wow 

261.71 272.29 A: um i uh well i mean i went to boston university but um there were there were some um studies over at um at h. b. s. so i went uh you know for the last couple of years 

269.76 270.64 B: (( ok- )) 

272.24 273.09 B: (( oh )) 

273.53 277.03 B: is she was there in eighty two and graduated in eighty two 

275.29 276.42 A: oh wow 

276.98 277.86 A: uh-huh 

277.67 289.10 B: but yeah that's strange uh i didn't know like i never think about how uh extensive craigslist ism but it's certainly a a good wealth of informa- or like just resources if you're in new york 

285.01 286.44 A: oh it's it's 

288.26 301.60 A: it is you know and and and it's the greatest thing i think um so you know i actually tried to advertise it today you know trying to recruit some people and they wouldn't let me put it on there because um they considered it a a a phone survey 

289.13 289.85 B: oh 

301.50 302.38 B: (( really )) 

302.22 309.42 A: yeah yeah so you kind of have to do it like kind of covertly and and put it like you know under for sale items and things like that 

309.22 312.95 B: i don't understand you were d- doing a phone survey for what 

312.40 317.53 A: well because they they think they consider the whole upenn fisher study as a phone survey 

317.01 319.60 B: (( oh oh oh oh i understand )) 

318.07 324.36 A: you know where in essence you know i kept telling them it's it's not a survey it's a you know it's a it's a study 

319.65 320.93 B: (( [noise] )) 

324.00 329.88 B: so it's strange i'm from pennsylvania from philadelphia and i just moved to new york city like ten months ago 

324.50 325.06 A: (( [mn] )) 

326.27 327.83 A: mm 

329.72 332.57 A: uh-huh was that because of um [lipsmack] 

330.05 331.29 B: i had been 

332.70 333.65 A: (( uh )) 

332.75 339.32 B: my wife got a job up here but then uh we uh subsequently had a baby so she left her position 

334.57 336.27 A: oh wow mhm 

339.32 353.22 B: and uh i'm retraining in school for computer stuff right now but uh i just thought it was odd to see on my call waiting or my caller i. d. it said university of pennsylvania so i had no idea this was based there 

339.35 340.39 A: right 

342.98 343.88 A: oh wow 

343.97 345.57 A: mm 

350.13 351.13 A: yeah 

352.71 357.12 A: and they're good i mean every night at you know last night at ten and tonight at ten you now 

355.99 363.73 B: yeah it seems every night about ten ten because i'd said don't call after ten as i recall on the thing i'm wondering is this for compensation is there 

363.32 374.23 A: uh yeah actually um if you signed up on the uh website you get um for ten minutes you get uh ten bucks and you can do up you can do up to three times so it's basically thirty dollars and then 

369.31 370.32 B: (( oh really )) 

374.05 378.98 A: for every with me it's for every male that i recruit um i get a dollar 

377.60 378.44 B: oh 

379.01 384.74 A: um so yeah that's that's why i'm trying to advertise [laughter] this as much as i can [laughter] 

379.20 380.25 B: oh okay 

383.52 385.04 B: oh sure it helps 

385.15 386.80 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

385.70 390.69 B: but [mn] is it a thir- like in the last thirty seconds you just kind of give a synopsis of uh 

391.35 392.36 B: of wh- 

391.44 406.42 A: uh i mean basically like what we did last night we talked about pets for the whole time you know so uh you know but again as you said kind of like what we look for in life partners you know i think you summed it up pretty well it's kind of like compatibility and it's you know somebody 

395.79 396.75 B: (( oh okay )) 

405.10 407.97 B: and how much you can tolerate of their [laughter] bad behaviour 

407.00 410.64 A: is yes it's tolerance and you know it's kind of like 

408.95 410.09 B: [laughter] 

410.69 420.00 A: [mn] part of it is like why you don't want to go into details with complete strangers about like you know your life's events and you now relationships [laughter] 

416.15 417.24 B: sure 

418.79 423.29 B: yeah well i mean kind of like you said how much they can tolerate me you know 

422.90 436.86 A: e- exact you know i mean that's to me that's the end all be all wi- with uh these kind of things you know it's tolerance and compatibility and you know at the end of the day like i guess being happy you know whatever that is 

428.38 431.01 B: [laughter] 

435.10 436.19 B: sure 

436.23 437.98 B: contentment sure 

437.31 439.16 A: yeah yeah 

438.92 440.20 B: (( well )) 

440.08 451.36 A: so it's it's definitely it's it's an interesting uh study that they're doing and basically i think it it it relates to you know how strangers talk about you know given a subject how they interact with each other 

450.94 457.49 B: i would think it's got to do i mean do they m- um we are being recorded i would assume somebody's listening in somewhere 

455.61 456.70 A: (( right mm )) 

457.15 461.44 A: mm yeah yeah i i think they say like you know it's recorded and they look at it later 

457.92 459.52 B: [laughter] 

461.05 462.82 B: yeah i would think 

462.22 476.24 A: yeah yeah but i'm sure like you know like topics like this that's what i was talking to my girlfriend about it i'm like you know i bet they're going to ask something about sex you know and they're they're going to put me like with some really like you know person that doesn't want to talk about any of that kind of stuff you know whatever 

463.00 464.02 B: but ultimate- 

469.67 470.57 B: uh-huh 

474.95 486.64 B: well the past couple of nights when i they called at ten after ten or something i i kind of thought about it i just said i want don't want to deal with this now i don't want to talk about it the pets or i don't want to talk about i don't know what it was the other night what was it the other night 

478.78 479.57 A: (( oh )) 

481.47 482.66 A: [laughter] 

484.47 485.75 A: right 

487.08 490.15 B: you said [noise] sports figures or something 

489.39 492.03 A: (( [laughter] sports [laughter] )) 

491.01 495.36 B: i mean i had no idea uh what to expect so my 

494.13 495.63 A: (( [mn] right )) 

495.47 500.66 B: wife just handed it to me she's like uh it's about life partners and like do you want to do this or not 

499.18 502.04 A: (( [laughter] )) 

501.46 503.41 B: so i just thought why not 

502.89 512.66 A: [laughter] yeah i was talking to my girlfriend 'cause you know she actually her um she has a cat you know and i i never had a pet for like a very long time you know it's good 

507.61 508.52 B: (( [mn] )) 

510.72 513.02 B: oh that's tolerability there 

512.43 524.10 A: it's a good ten or fifteen years so it was so funny 'cause like the first night was pets the second night is is like you know life partners so it's like they're picking everything out of my my life here you know that had just occurred in within the last four months 

516.35 517.45 B: oh yeah 

517.92 518.59 B: [laughter] 

523.69 527.52 B: well this is strange has this been going on for a while th- this study or 

526.53 540.95 A: you know i i i actually called over there um yesterday uh to get some more information because you know they ask for your social security number and i thought yeah i just wanted to make sure you know being from d. c. kind of a a really uh you know edgy about giving any of that stuff out 

530.34 531.08 B: (( mhm )) 

533.85 534.80 B: oh do they 

540.11 541.16 B: sure 

541.06 546.89 A: and um you know i was like how long has this been going on she said since uh january actually 

546.84 552.21 B: i don't even remember filling it out on craigslist i mean i i respond to so many of those like uh 

552.43 559.59 B: uh what do you call them uh focus groups and stuff like that and i've done quite a few 'cause there's a lot of advertising agencies here in new york 

555.71 556.79 A: sure 

557.10 557.76 A: (( oh )) 

559.24 560.28 A: of course 

559.71 571.98 B: so i i've done a few like advertising for like metlife in the last you know [mn] you know about this ad program or [mn] campaign they're doing and you know you make a hundred bucks here they buy you lunch or you know and i've done a few 

565.67 566.76 A: (( mm )) 

570.79 572.62 A: right right mm 

572.08 580.23 B: and i've passed a few on to my wife that i see and uh you know and and i'd say one out of s- six or seven of them that i i 

580.31 588.32 B: [mn] send my number too i get a response from 'cause there's so many on there and some of them [mn] aren't you know i don't fit the bill but obviously 

581.94 583.73 A: (( mm yeah )) 

586.77 588.27 A: oh yeah i mean it 

588.38 599.89 A: it's absolutely amazing i actually found out about the site um the first time when i was uh just graduating from b. u. last uh last may and i had a ton of you know old crappy college furn- 

588.44 589.02 B: (( [mn] oh )) 

596.31 597.20 B: okay
