304.45 305.34 B: [laughter] 

305.18 309.06 A: uh what are some other qualities that you'd you'd think would be good 

308.91 309.89 B: i'm sorry 

309.92 312.89 A: what are some other qualities that you think would be good 

312.35 315.94 B: uh other quality you mean the partners 

315.37 317.28 A: yeah 

316.16 322.20 B: uh yeah first i think uh your partner should be 

322.30 324.12 B: uh uh 

324.56 331.68 B: at least uh very frank to [mn] uh fr- very frank to you right and then it 

329.83 330.85 A: mhm 

333.44 336.87 B: [mn] he or she should be uh mm 

339.11 343.19 B: yeah i like somebody who is v- very honest you know 

343.82 353.02 A: yeah rather than rather than you know say something that would just keep you happy you'd rather hear their their honest opinion whether or not you agree with it 

352.37 353.67 B: yes 

353.70 354.64 B: yes 

354.68 357.88 B: and uh your partner should not be you know 

358.75 366.95 B: [mn] i i i like i like the the partner be more be honest more than keep you keep you always happy you [laughter] know 

366.84 369.50 A: yep yep 

368.55 372.25 B: it's uh useful otherwise um 

372.48 380.51 B: you know is it [mn] the partner is not uh eligible uh trust- trustable one 

380.77 381.87 A: mhm 

381.68 389.40 B: and uh if you are for example sometimes if you are a supervisor in your 

389.47 394.59 B: division a company uh you may sometimes you know you're 

394.73 395.70 B: um 

395.72 398.98 B: the m- the member in your department may 

399.08 400.02 B: uh 

400.26 404.67 B: keep you [mn] want to make you happy and then they 

405.44 406.67 B: uh 

407.24 412.56 B: say some good good words to you because you are the supervisor right 

412.15 413.27 A: mhm 

412.65 418.16 B: uh if you like [mn] them you like him you may 

418.41 419.35 B: (( hm )) 

420.05 421.04 B: (( [lipsmack] uh )) 

421.85 432.22 B: [mn] yeah you you may give give him or her uh some good some goodness during the work so but 

432.92 442.91 B: y- y- you may you may think oh uh it's my i i can't trust her trust uh him or her but that is wrong i think 

443.45 450.98 A: kind of like uh if they're saying something good they're kind of buttering you up so maybe you'll overlook something that they did wrong i 

449.90 451.23 B: yeah 

451.96 453.88 A: mean i can understand that that's 

454.68 457.74 A: yeah that that goes on a lot in the workplace i suppose 

457.81 458.74 B: [laughter] 

458.98 460.32 B: and though yes 

459.35 465.45 A: and that's that's why it's nice to have uh you know a partner that when you get home and they're not going to be 

465.25 475.57 A: you know just your biggest cheerleader they're gonna you know tell you how it is and you know maybe if you tell 'em what happened they'd be like no you know you were wrong in that situation even if it's not going to make you happy 

475.28 477.73 B: mhm yes 

480.02 481.46 B: (( yeah and uh )) 

482.69 485.86 B: yeah are are you working in com- in a company or 

485.97 489.66 A: uh yeah actually i'm a a captain in a fire department 

489.26 490.27 B: (( no oh )) 

490.60 491.52 A: so 

491.29 500.50 B: so in a in a company uh i i think in a in a in a company you i think is a harder they find somebody uh [mn] 

500.54 503.88 B: who you can trust and completely you know 

503.74 505.28 A: yeah yep 

504.83 513.56 B: because uh in the same company everyone has the related uh interest maybe sometimes um both of interest 

514.49 518.51 B: [mn] could be conflicted so at that time too 

518.84 524.71 A: yeah but you know perhaps they're they're looking out for themselves and not everybody else around them 

523.48 525.57 B: yeah everybody you know 

526.34 531.80 B: uh regardless has own interest as f- as a f- first priority [laughter] you know 

531.80 537.48 A: yep well then it's real tough in the fire department 'cause we work twenty four hour days 

537.28 538.98 B: twenty four hours days 

537.72 538.55 A: so 

538.86 544.30 A: yeah so i i come in at seven o'clock in the morning and i spend twenty fours with the same three guys 

544.02 545.02 B: oh 

544.96 551.84 A: so it's it's kind a you know you look for the same thing in in your co workers here that you would look for at home because you know 

552.12 556.16 A: uh ten days of every month i i live with these guys you know and you know 

556.03 557.02 B: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

556.90 560.06 A: so kind of look for the same things in these guys 'cause uh 

560.18 564.69 A: if if you can't get along it makes it a really really rough day [laughter] 

564.25 566.57 B: oh so crazy uh 

569.40 570.46 B: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

570.86 572.72 B: i think uh 

572.76 574.00 B: (( yeah so [mn] )) 

574.30 575.31 B: (( uh [mn] uh [mn] ))
