61.99 63.02 B: (( ahah )) 

63.53 72.85 A: and i think for for me a business that i would be interested in starting would be probably something in the information technology world um 

71.95 73.14 B: okay 

72.94 80.24 A: i have experience in software engineering and also you know i've i've dabbled around with hardware 

79.81 80.79 B: (( ahah )) 

80.33 84.00 A: um so i it's one of the things that actually i have thought about doing 

83.67 84.71 B: (( ahah )) 

84.12 85.13 A: um 

85.29 95.43 A: matter of fact i i contacted a company called computer moms about this very thing but they were setting up some kind of a franchise situation 

89.40 90.16 B: (( ah )) 

94.68 95.71 B: uh-huh 

95.65 101.43 A: and it was pretty ex- i mean it was like thirty thousand dollars just to get your foot in the door 

101.06 103.56 B: wow [laughter] [laughter] 

101.96 111.58 A: so yeah yeah i know so [laughter] it was like you gotta pony up money do you you know before you do anything but as at least outta that you get marketing and that type of thing 

107.89 108.80 B: yeah 

111.15 121.63 B: yeah well you know the thing about ah ah opening up a used furniture store which i'd like to do is the fact that my it my overhead is very low other than 

121.54 135.98 B: ah probably finding a nice location in in a store front ah that's really my only ah expenses you know because ah what i intend to do is ah you know most of the stuff that we have ah 

129.90 131.78 A: mhm right mhm 

136.07 147.87 B: furniture put out dates up in this area and so like on tuesdays and thursdays people put out a lot of furniture you know and so ah besides ah 

144.46 146.06 A: oh sure 

147.89 159.29 B: renting the space and perhaps ah electricity and and say ah heating in the winter time ah i'd only need a truck you know and i can get a used truck 

155.21 156.34 A: right right 

158.12 160.94 A: for delivery and for pick up and delivery right 

160.24 163.87 B: right right right you know and ah 

162.65 167.70 A: what about costs like i- i- insurance and those type of things business insurance you know 

165.71 166.64 B: oh 

166.68 172.25 B: well really the only insurance that i would really have is is the insurance on my on the truck 

172.29 175.12 B: and that's about it you know 

174.54 176.07 A: mhm yeah ahah 

175.33 183.86 B: b- b- because everything else is ah you know like i pick up the stuff i pick up you know the the furniture that people are putting out you know ah 

182.83 184.35 A: sure sure 

183.79 194.00 B: on those days and i just clean it up a little bit and put it in the store and and basically a- all everything i'm nearly one hundred per cent profit [laughter] you know 

192.35 193.12 A: (( ahah i- )) 

193.45 200.83 A: is who who normally picks up that stuff on tuesdays and thursdays is that open to just the general public or 

200.42 201.78 B: general public 

200.84 202.75 A: who who does that yeah 

201.81 212.82 B: general public but if no one picks it up by a say a certain time like say [mn] excuse me four o'clock well then you know the ah sanitation department comes by and they break it up and they 

212.85 216.35 B: you know dispose [laughter] of it you know yeah 

212.90 213.64 A: oh 

214.62 215.95 A: no kidding huh 

216.62 220.19 A: interesting i i didn't i didn't know they did that [laughter] 

219.08 225.52 B: yeah [laughter] yeah so tell me a little more about your you know en- your enterprise 

220.67 221.51 A: (( huh )) 

226.02 227.12 A: um 

227.70 237.50 A: well like i said i i've got a lot of experience with software development and what i could see doing especially as a lot of people are switching over to 

231.29 232.25 B: (( ahah )) 

237.59 243.81 A: broadband computer systems and they're putting you know wireless networks and and those type of things i 

243.95 257.20 A: i could very easily go in and and do that type of work for people because i've done it for myself already um and i know there's eee there there's quite a few people out there that want to do some of these things 

248.05 249.09 B: mhm 

249.77 250.63 B: yeah 

256.81 257.76 B: (( ahah )) 

257.27 267.29 A: um and and many people you know are you know they're they're smart enough to go ahead and do that but some people they're they're really kind of afraid of it 

263.99 264.94 B: right 

266.88 268.13 B: okay 

267.66 275.37 A: yeah th- they want that kind of a a a feature they want that kind of technology but they don't really understand how it all works 

274.75 276.54 B: okay okay 

275.87 285.35 A: so i i could very easily you know install both the hardware pieces of this as well as explain to them how to use the software and of course configure the software to 'em 

282.89 283.99 B: mhm 

285.41 286.42 A: um 

286.38 296.64 A: so again there's e as far as i'm concerned that you know start up costs um if i were to start my own business without the help of something like computer moms 

295.96 297.14 B: mhm 

296.51 304.81 A: it would be relatively easy for me to do it wouldn't be a whole lotta money basically it it's some advertising to get my name out there um 

300.14 301.19 B: okay 

303.39 304.32 B: (( ahah )) 

305.42 317.30 A: and you know some experience with people and i've i've already actually i've already got some experience through locally where i've volunteered time over at the colorado mountain club and i've done some software projects for them 

314.18 315.17 B: (( ahah )) 

316.77 318.11 B: right 

317.53 328.19 A: so i could easily point to that and say you know i've already done this kinda thing i'm you know i have references and i i know i could do it it's just ah a matter of whether i want to 

328.21 342.03 A: put that time and energy into a business here in golden um i when i'm actually considering long term i wanna move back down to south western colorado which is down near the four corners area 

332.14 333.43 B: (( right [noise] )) 

341.46 342.79 B: (( ahah [noise] [noise] )) 

342.03 347.99 A: which i- which was different than here up in ah i don't know if you're familiar with golden and with denver [noise] 

347.22 349.33 B: no i know nothing about [laughter] it 

349.43 351.99 B: nothing about that area at all 

352.33 358.71 B: [laughter] but you know one thing i'm wondering about though ah what about your population ah
