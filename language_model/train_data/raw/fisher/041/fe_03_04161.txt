343.02 346.71 B: yeah they're like twenty five to thirty percent off 

346.13 355.07 A: yeah and then if you look if you search the internet a little bit you can always find promotions too like an extra ten percent off or an extra twenty percent off 

351.16 352.21 B: uh-huh 

354.30 355.22 B: mhm 

355.02 361.52 A: and i'm always getting amazon gift certificates too 'cause i do the study you know like where i found this 

362.27 363.61 A: this pen 

363.37 364.64 B: (( mhm )) 

363.79 371.71 A: study you know i do those survey sites and often you do the surveys for uh for amazon d- gift certificates 

366.38 367.22 B: uh-huh 

372.04 374.78 B: oh but they usually only give five dollars 

374.42 377.13 A: no i get t- i've been getting ten lately 

376.53 388.31 B: how how do you go into the amazon dot com thing only if you buy a lot because i do buy stuff from amazon but i only usually when i get surveys to answer they only pay like five dollars 

387.99 391.41 A: no some of the d- d- do you know who does it is uh 

391.50 392.84 A: visidence 

392.97 394.27 A: they give ten 

393.26 394.58 B: (( oh vividence )) 

394.29 398.54 A: they give yeah sign up for them they give five dollar uh ten dollar gift certificates 

395.03 395.97 B: uh-huh 

397.90 402.52 B: oh okay i'm right now i i got this from armani in shopping 

402.75 406.36 B: i joined those armani in shopping the mothers at before 

405.63 407.33 A: oh yeah 

406.77 408.68 B: so that's how i learned this thing 

409.35 413.52 B: but anyway you know with the amazon dot com the shipping is great too 

413.05 415.38 A: yeah it's free yeah if you buy twenty five dollars worth 

413.58 421.11 B: they do free shipping twenty five yeah before i think it used to be seventy five and then they drop it down to twenty five which is really great 

415.45 416.46 A: yeah 

418.69 432.54 A: i tell you i think it's a smart strategy because even if it's a small shipping and handling charge i don't wanna pay it i'd probably pay i would probably psychologically i'd probably pay more for the book 

424.87 425.97 B: mhm 

432.74 437.51 A: if it were free shipping than a little less for the book and pay for shipping 

434.12 435.15 B: mhm 

436.59 442.91 B: that's true i always think that shipping costs a lot i mean you pay six bucks for shipping a book 

441.98 455.06 A: i mean there's a million there's a million of stuff that that crap they advertise on television i would own half the stuff i'd buy if it was the price they were saying but then you see the little print eight dollar shipping and handling and say oh forget 

446.31 447.41 B: uh-huh 

454.09 457.73 B: that really turns you off right yeah 

455.60 457.86 A: it yeah does it turn you off 

458.28 464.81 B: and it does it does a lot and i do a lot of shopping over the internet lately this past two years 

464.98 472.03 B: i really do a lot of shopping over the internet just because for the convenience of it and you don't need to go out but i always 

469.15 470.13 A: uh-huh 

472.46 483.00 B: either find a deal that they do free shipping or or something that you know the shipping is not way too much for me or something that in case it doesn't work out 

483.19 486.35 B: return to the store without shipping it back 

485.97 488.57 A: oh yeah that's who do you shop with 

487.31 488.37 B: yeah 

488.98 498.83 B: um i do a lot um amazon dot com and then i buy some video games from half dot com and then for my kids and then 

497.33 499.80 A: (( mostly )) 

498.93 504.72 B: um i also get from barnes and noble like the buy two books you get for free shipping 

504.31 506.87 A: oh yeah oh do they have that i didn't know that 

506.27 513.37 B: they always have it they've had it for i think almost a year already if you buy two books from barnes and noble over the internet 

513.54 518.46 B: [lipsmack] it's free shipping and then you can return it to the store in case you don't like it 

519.06 522.89 A: you know who has cheap shipping too is overstock dot com 

522.31 526.75 B: oh yeah it's only two ninety five for a flat free yeah 

523.78 527.52 A: yeah yeah i've bought a few things from them 

526.84 534.07 B: yeah i've never i wanted to buy a rug from there but i wasn't sure because sometimes you don't see it mm 

533.26 539.32 A: yeah you look and you look and you look and you think oh it looks nice it looks nice it looks nice and then you think uh wh- 

534.33 535.45 B: yeah

564.34 571.23 A: so what do you think we'd better talk about the subject a little bit did w- do you think we'd make money of our enterprises 

571.51 574.97 B: i think i would [laughter] 

575.17 581.37 B: i think i would hire a chef from toronto because they really cook very good food [lipsmack] 

580.77 583.32 A: yeah and they're all anxious to leave toronto now 

582.91 586.75 B: mhm [laughter] oh yeah from the sars right 

584.16 587.67 A: (( [laughter] yeah you get 'em cheap )) 

587.74 592.44 B: but but i think yours i don't know might be a little bit harder for you 

590.27 591.70 A: mine's not a 

591.91 594.34 A: b- mine's not a moneymaking proposition 

593.06 599.89 B: if you are just centering on just history books unless if you you do a lot more diversity with your 

596.20 597.00 A: no
