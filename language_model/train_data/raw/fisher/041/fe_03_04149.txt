0.04 1.15 A: hello 

0.65 4.41 B: hello my name is pat what is your name 

4.32 5.27 A: tina 

5.90 10.61 B: oh well um what do you think about opening up your own business 

11.00 14.98 A: if i was to open up my own business i think i would open up a salon 

15.75 17.47 B: uh a beauty salon 

17.02 18.35 A: mhm 

18.61 22.33 B: [sigh] oh that'd be nice why would you do that are you a beautician 

22.49 27.33 A: no but it's like every time i go to the salon it's really crowded 

27.36 29.66 A: and i think they make a lot of money 

30.17 31.09 A: (( so )) 

30.20 32.37 B: oh well that's true [laughter] 

31.69 34.37 A: i think that's kinda where the money's at 

35.16 45.19 B: [sigh] i think i would open up a a um a dollar store maybe in a small town that has nothing you know that they have to travel a great distance to get to a store [sigh] 

44.77 46.22 A: yeah 

46.08 60.21 B: like the town that i live in we have twelve hundred people and we have to drive twenty miles you know [laughter] you know just to get to a a decent store we have a little grocery store and that's about it [laughter] 

52.45 53.91 A: oh god 

59.88 61.48 A: oh 

61.93 63.47 A: okay 

63.09 70.34 B: [sigh] but i i think um if money wasn't an issue i i i think it would go over big because we have 

70.23 79.72 B: vacant buildings in town and i think i would [sigh] um rather than buy one i think i would rent it to see how something like that would go over [sigh] 

79.79 86.10 A: yeah i mean dollar stores over here like i live in a big city they get 

86.26 95.48 A: like a lot of business and there's like stores um like i can walk to like four of them in like five minutes and it's always crowded in each of them 

96.01 98.62 B: oh really huh [sigh] w- 

97.64 99.51 A: so i live in new york so 

100.11 104.15 B: oh whereabouts in new york we're only ten minutes uh we're we're 

104.53 109.30 B: well it it's eighteen miles to new york state [laughter] [sigh] 

108.68 110.25 A: oh 

111.28 112.62 A: (( so there's )) 

111.64 117.47 B: but all the towns round here are small so i think it would be a good opportunity for a good business 

117.49 118.30 B: (( [sigh] )) 

118.40 119.60 A: okay 

120.01 120.93 B: um 

122.08 126.04 B: what what would you have to do first would you have to go to school and be trained to 

125.96 131.63 A: i think so i mean i don't know i think as long as you have the money you can open up a salon 

126.24 126.85 B: (( [sigh] )) 

131.64 135.47 A: but i think the beauticians in the salon will have to be licensed 

136.57 138.92 B: [sigh] yeah i think so too [laughter] 

138.13 145.47 A: but it wouldn't be smart 'cause you have to have somebody that handles the money and you know like my dad was gonna give me money once 

145.39 156.32 A: to um open it up up a salon but i didn't wanna do it because it's like you have to have somebody that went to school you have to go to school and find out how to manage the money and stuff like that [sigh] 

157.05 166.99 B: well yeah and it but of course if you rented the building and and the other girls paid you for a spot to to be able to operate in there that wouldn't be bad either 

167.01 172.79 B: you know like they'd paid you [mn] for their customers to come into there to your shop 

172.28 173.52 A: yeah 

173.04 176.64 B: and you could be like a receptionist or something [sigh] 

176.00 178.95 A: yeah and see what goes on 

179.38 184.60 A: but i think that you would have to go to school just like for the money management part 

184.84 190.37 A: just managing a business period i think you will have to do some type of schooling i think it would be smart to do that 

190.85 196.72 B: well i think the only way you're gonna make really big money is to have your own build- your own business 

196.42 197.73 A: mhm 

197.25 204.28 B: 'cause my parents had a small grocery store before all the big supermarkets came into the area and 

204.29 207.69 B: they never had any time to themselves so i don't know 

207.94 210.59 B: if i would really like that or not [laughter] 

210.65 211.91 A: (( mm )) 

211.55 212.67 B: i mean they 

212.86 217.67 B: they put in a long day and seven days a week and [laughter] 

217.28 218.87 A: oh god 

220.18 223.84 A: i mean the small i have a grocery across the street from my home 

223.68 236.06 A: and around the corner is just opened up a dollar store so it was like why go across the street to the grocery store when they sell like a roll of toilet paper for seventy five cents when you can go to the dollar store and get two for a dollar 

236.35 240.28 A: so like there i know i can tell they're not making business any more 

240.01 246.39 B: [sigh] yeah or or when they start giving triple coupons you know that they're dying for new customers [laughter] 

245.75 247.24 A: yeah 

246.64 247.70 B: [laughter] 

248.08 248.81 B: (( [noise] )) 

249.77 257.97 B: but you know i think you'd have to really look around good for a good location a place where people have a place to park without having to pay for parking 

256.49 259.09 A: yeah yeah 

258.21 260.19 B: and that kind of stuff 

259.38 267.88 A: 'cause my mom was gonna open up a restaurant like it was like around the corner from like a complex area like has like complex buildings 

267.78 275.68 A: so like she knew like you know it would be a lot of money 'cause it wasn't like just houses separated like out it was like a complex 

276.18 278.82 B: you mean apartment complex [noise] 

277.55 283.77 A: yeah so like she was gonna open up she had found a place to open up the restaurant there 

284.13 295.79 A: but then she didn't end up doing it 'cause like she was like you know you have to go to school just for the money management part you have to have some type of college education about that so she didn't do it 

294.36 302.94 B: [sigh] well either that or you'd have to get a good bookkeeper that would be able you know keep track of everything for ya i think that'd be kinda hard [sigh] 

298.04 299.22 A: yeah 

302.37 303.83 A: yeah 

303.13 305.26 B: i think you'd almost have to [mn] 

306.43 312.68 B: be in the area and watch that area and watch and see how many people go back and forth all the time [sigh] 

312.15 326.21 A: yeah but out here that's not so hard 'cause it's like [noise] you know a lot of people like in and out of the city so it's it's like really crowded out here i don't know like over there where you're from 

319.96 320.88 B: (( [sigh] )) 

326.38 327.71 A: it's probably like 

326.48 330.17 B: oh no we're we're out in the country [laughter] 

329.19 335.38 A: oh okay so it's probably not that busy but it's so busy every day out here even on a sunday 

336.85 338.41 A: (( it's so busy )) 

339.85 346.12 B: and you know half the thing is when you have a business people hate to wait they wanna be taken care of right now [laughter] you know [sigh] 

346.26 347.70 A: mhm 

348.28 349.49 B: so 

349.67 351.32 B: did you ever um 

351.40 353.72 B: think of any other type of business 

353.85 360.06 A: i was thinking about a restaurant too no i was also thinking about a hotel opening up a hotel 

360.29 372.59 A: 'cause there's not a lot out here there's maybe like one but it's like really like a train ride or a bus ride away or like in a taxicab like twenty minutes so i was thinking about that 

373.56 374.52 A: but 

373.61 379.92 B: well maybe even like a bread and br- bed and breakfast type thing you know to start off small [sigh] 

379.82 380.90 A: yeah 

380.14 382.26 B: would be kinda nice [sigh] 

382.23 385.37 A: (( i really like that too )) 

385.38 390.52 A: but again you have to have like the money you have to take out a loan 

391.00 393.59 A: and stuff like that 

393.33 396.18 B: yeah but if you if you didn't really have to worry about 

396.32 403.27 B: money even a even a daycare center to open up your own daycare would be really with all the women working [laughter] 

396.76 397.89 A: the money 

400.56 402.20 A: yeah i like them 

402.67 403.92 A: yeah 

404.42 406.20 A: (( that'd be cool too )) 

406.09 409.21 B: i don't know if i could handle that though [laughter] 

408.77 416.01 A: yeah not really i wouldn't have i have patience for kids but not really it's to a certain extent it depends how old they are how 

416.09 420.34 A: like you know if they're a momma's kid and stuff like that 

419.74 425.66 B: [sigh] well i'd be afr- i i wouldn't wanna handle little babies you know in a business like that 'cause 

425.76 434.02 B: [mn] i i'd always be worrying if something happened and i'd be responsible i i'd want 'em to be about three or four years old maybe [laughter] 

433.80 439.48 A: yeah 'cause around five i say they should know right from wrong 

434.73 435.50 B: (( [sigh] )) 

439.79 441.22 B: [noise] that's right 

440.97 451.12 A: so when you deal with them and they're two they really don't know but when they're like five they should know you know right from wrong so it's better to deal with those that age group 

451.33 458.90 A: i used to work in like a daycare and i dealt with like that age group five or six year old girls and they were easy to get along with 

459.48 468.30 B: [sigh] yeah i think they're nicer when they're that age but i just wouldn't wanna be responsible for a newborn baby or something when a mother went back to work i'd just 

468.39 471.41 B: i'd i think i'd be too nervous to do that [laughter] 

470.50 473.01 A: but the thing is the newborns they have 

473.16 477.94 A: five and six year olds they always wanna you could be on the train and they have to use the bathroom 

479.15 481.33 B: well that's true too [laughter] 

479.41 480.14 A: (( so )) 

480.82 486.96 A: you have to make sure they use the bathroom and then you gotta make sure you don't give them too much to drink because then they have to use the bathroom 

490.77 500.56 B: [sigh] [sigh] oh gosh i i don't know if i would really really have the energy to to really get around and and do all the things that you have to do to start a business 

500.50 501.42 A: [laughter] 

500.78 510.30 B: [laughter] i'd rather see one maybe that was already operating and the people were gonna retire or something and maybe then you know go in and if you had the money 

509.08 513.67 A: that will be yeah that will be easier 'cause you already will have clientele 

513.74 522.27 B: yeah and not only that you you'd probably everything would be set up that you had to you wouldn't you'd know all the equipment you needed and 

522.29 524.79 B: you know what to expect really [laughter] 

524.18 525.47 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

531.89 534.88 B: [noise] i don't know would your would [mn] are you married 

534.96 537.46 A: no i'm i'm [sigh] 

535.82 536.84 B: well 

537.93 543.79 A: soon like i don't know i'm supposed to be getting proposed to soon but i don't know wanna know when 

543.53 548.68 B: oh oh 'cause sometimes husbands don't like their wives to be in business [laughter] 

548.51 549.78 A: oh [laughter] 

549.12 556.79 B: and that's why i kinda wondered i think i don't think my husband would like it too much unless he could be part of it [sigh] 

556.36 568.95 A: yeah but usually it's like a husband and wife there in charge of you know one thing it's not like the wife alone or the husband alone usually like you go in like an established business and you see like them working together 

570.07 583.77 B: yeah but like our our kids are are live far away from us now and and i'd hate to be tied down really to a small business i i think i'd have to consider that very carefully before i ever got involved [laughter] 

583.49 585.46 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

584.47 588.98 B: 'cause i'd want the free time to to be able to go and visit my family but 

590.74 598.08 B: then again it would be nice to be able to have your children working there also and have it a family business [noise] yeah i mean 'cause the doctor that i 

594.83 595.90 A: (( [noise] )) 

596.25 597.51 A: yeah
