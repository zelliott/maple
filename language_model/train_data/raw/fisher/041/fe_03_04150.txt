103.73 112.50 B: no i you know it's one of those things where it's funny that that's the topic for today because you know i people always say well why don't you do this and why don't you do that and i keep thinking 

112.48 120.09 B: well yeah but you know i'm [laughter] i'm a little i'm a little weak in that in that area [sigh] um 

117.84 118.83 A: oh

133.03 134.33 A: oh okay 

134.03 141.63 B: so um and we've moved around the country i mean we're in philadelphia now i'm doing some freelance type work now uh

146.07 149.26 B: universities uh you know medical schools here in town 

148.94 149.97 A: oh 

149.65 151.12 B: have you heard of that 

150.53 152.25 A: n- uh no no 

151.69 159.01 B: well it's actually very interesting you you basically it's kinda well acting in a way although not always um 

158.46 160.94 A: you're like a professional patient [laughter] [sigh] 

160.02 166.31 B: exactly and it's actually really interesting it's actually quite challenging there's a lot of actors that actually do it but as a 

166.32 174.52 B: um but you don't necessarily have to be you know to be an actor to do it either i mean sometimes actors don't work out because you know you have to really do 

174.90 186.72 B: you do have to be very much within the parameters of of what they set you know of the case often the more more often than not the cases are actually based on [noise] real cases and then we also do instructional work where actually i've learned i've 

179.90 180.82 A: sure 

186.74 189.78 B: learned how to do a neurological exam you know 

189.87 191.24 B: um but 

190.61 195.70 A: [laughter] well i'd love to hear more about that but i guess we should stick to the topic [laughter] 

192.32 203.11 B: yeah but i know i was just thinking i'm getting a little off the subject but actually what i was thinking would always be so much fun is one of those things i've always thought about but didn't you know begin if i had all the money in the world and i could get help 

201.64 203.68 A: yes yes yeah 

203.07 214.61 B: yeah our my husband is a south asia bibliographer [mn] well now he's a south asia bibliographer at penn and he goes back and forth to places like india bangladesh and and pakistan and you know there are so many 

214.68 222.51 B: cool things that you never see here not even at places like ten thousand villages or something which which do a really very good job 

222.56 230.84 B: and there are so many fun things that you know would also then really support people in those countries i mean a lot of them are like village crafts or whatever or even 

230.99 244.09 B: you know they have craft you know sort of craft effort you know sort of help self help efforts too and they have uh stores in major indian cities you know that that that they don't just 

237.22 238.27 A: mhm 

244.26 246.98 B: pile they don't just target the um 

247.36 259.86 B: tourists they also target you know people that live there but there are so many fun things that you never see here or even just just wonderful textiles and things and it would just be so much you know fun to 

259.92 271.62 B: be able to bring those you know to import those things i i actually think they'd find i actually think that they'd find a market uh wouldn't necessarily have your own store but you know you could sell them probably to 

263.44 265.10 A: and start a store 

271.77 276.98 B: i think you could sell them to a a whole variety of different types of venues from 

277.15 280.98 B: you know sort of urban outfitters or ikea to 

280.99 282.01 A: (( oh okay )) 

281.12 284.92 B: you know to smaller to smaller gift shops or 

283.86 286.18 A: so you're thinking big like a distributor 

286.09 292.34 B: yeah exactly more be a distributor because i think there are just so many there are just so many fun things that they have 

292.35 295.45 B: decorations and um 

295.66 301.97 B: kind of even traditional type painting and things like that you just never see here but you can get really easily when you're there 

301.59 302.87 A: mhm 

302.38 307.13 B: um so you know that's that's kind of what i always thought would be a really cool idea 

306.83 307.76 A: oh 

307.17 312.44 B: um you know you're sort of supporting people in their effort to kind of support themselves uh 

311.61 313.12 A: right right 

312.49 313.76 B: and um 

313.35 315.58 A: well uh i i 

315.53 329.01 A: uh in addition to being a screenwriter i also write books and and my experience has right now i've been trying to get this book into bookstores and it's been very hard well not bookstores sorry gift stores and it's been very difficult 

329.15 343.00 A: you know convincing these people to carry the book and you would think oh you know you know here's another product that would be appropriate to carry and yet they're like no you know we're not buying or you know it's it's we just don't wanna deal with it and blah blah blah and so 

343.31 344.93 B: yeah that's [mn] 

343.34 348.33 A: having had a little experience with that it's kind of like well okay so how would you convince these people 

347.04 359.54 B: how would you do it and that's of course the other thing is i think that you've brought up a really good point is that the other point is is kind of inertia people do things in a certain way and they and they are really afraid to step out 

359.62 364.90 B: to step out of that uh you know just sort of related to this is actually a business but a a 

364.91 374.60 B: friend of mine who's much younger than i am but is also a happens to be a standardized patient she's actually a professional dancer as well she is actually a qualified funeral director 

371.36 372.18 A: oh 

374.40 375.37 A: oh 

374.68 380.68 B: you know she was looking for something that she could do that she could also do part time and still be remain active in the art 

380.42 381.27 A: yes 

381.14 394.38 B: so she actually is a [laughter] she's been doing it for quite a few years now she actually is a funeral director and she's got you know so she actually has a degree in mortuary science but she's gotten more off now in terms of um 

394.62 407.50 B: and this is again a business which is really interesting uh 'cause she's gotten in the you know sort of funeral direction in other words helping people plan a funeral and what do they need and she's actually started a freelance business where and and more 

407.18 408.53 A: (( [noise] )) 

407.76 413.86 B: and she works with a with kind of a small handful of funeral homes that tend to be owned by younger people 

413.44 414.35 A: uh-huh 

414.06 414.94 B: uh 

414.91 415.92 B: and 

415.82 421.19 B: basically rather than having them try to do this because you actually have to have a special you actually have to 

421.16 435.69 B: [sigh] take a special examination because of the insurance thing and all that sort of thing you know so they would actually have to have somebody on their staff that has those qualifications she does it for different funeral homes and um we actually did it for my 

434.78 439.41 A: what you have to if you run a funeral home you have to take a physical or 

438.58 446.02 B: well no this isn't a physical this is a special exam that has to do with with insurance and knowing all the you know the the 

445.51 447.65 A: the regulations for handling 

446.33 454.86 B: the regulations and insurance and all that sort of thing and she's and you know you have to actually pay and it's actually a test that's only given once a year and if you flunk it you have to wait till the next year 

454.39 455.28 A: okay 

455.28 463.62 B: so she's been offering her services so she you know qualified and to several different nursing homes oh not nursing homes i mean um funeral homes 

463.64 469.20 B: and what they do is they actually go and you you actually go into people's homes and help them plan funerals and she said it's 

469.28 481.09 B: it's a complete different dynamic because she said what they are finding is that people tend to make more realistic decisions about what they really need and want whether it's for themselves or a loved one 

469.50 470.96 A: oh right pre need 

481.21 493.63 B: and uh we actually did it for my dad who's who's not in very good shape and he's in a v. a. nursing home but you know she comes you know as a friend but but you know we uh but she comes she represents a particular nursing home and um 

484.50 485.31 A: oh 

486.06 487.19 A: (( sorry to hear that yeah )) 

494.22 504.13 B: [sigh] but you know they help you make a plan so that you make something people make something that's within their budget that is kind of not too elaborate for what they want or too stripped down you know or whatever 

504.25 515.26 B: and again you would think that wow what a good idea you know you have somebody that's really qualified to help people you know it's a person that's between mediates between the the funeral home and uh 

515.33 520.19 B: and the uh the prospective [laughter] the prospective person 

519.54 521.13 A: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

520.30 532.82 B: and um and because it's so it's a service that everybody at some point is gonna need [laughter] realistically speaking but she said you know it has been very interesting just exactly what you're saying with your book it's so kind of ironic [sigh] 

524.30 526.73 A: yeah unfortunately 

532.89 536.09 B: she said it's very hard to sell a lot of these 

536.28 543.66 B: funeral homes on this because they just they don't even the funeral homes sorta they don't wanna sorta think outside the box 

536.35 537.45 A: yeah 

537.72 540.08 A: people don't wanna think about it 

543.20 544.34 A: mhm 

543.73 549.54 B: you know it's not like you're you're persuading people to spend less money or more money you're just you're 

549.46 560.86 B: you're just simply helping them to do what they think is best for their family or for themselves or what- you know making a more meaningful decision but people just don't often you know they they kind of you 

561.08 563.69 B: know it's interesting i often see how people 

564.17 567.01 B: they uh ultimately they make sorta short run decisions 

566.76 580.74 A: mhm mhm oh you know i thought of a another business i would run this is some- this is a thought i had when i ever if i ever won the lottery [laughter] would be would be to start a foundation to fund 

576.30 578.12 B: ooh [laughter] 

580.61 594.63 A: businesses of of all my friends basically you know accept proposals for you know their business ideas and then to you know if it's a sound idea or not approve it you know and give 'em seed money to start up their own businesses 

593.93 599.53 B: oh that's a great idea you know my sister and i were my sister has been casting about looking for
