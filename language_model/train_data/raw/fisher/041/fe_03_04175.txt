3.37 4.21 A: (( how you do- )) 

4.67 8.41 A: hi david uh this is steve i'm in new york city how're you doing 

8.36 13.13 B: uh pretty good i i that's like the third new york person i've gotten that's pretty cool 

9.57 10.13 A: (( [cough] )) 

12.61 15.34 A: i'm sorry i am the third new york 

15.52 18.51 B: no that's uh that's the third person i've gotten from new york 

18.33 19.48 A: oh wow 

19.21 21.06 B: out of like five calls so 

21.24 24.47 A: i've uh i've never gotten anyone from new york 

25.36 26.50 B: but um 

25.36 26.34 A: (( but um )) 

26.49 29.80 A: so if you had to open your business own business what would it be 

29.78 37.47 B: well there's a couple that i've had in mind that i actually might pursue also but are you familiar with like cyber cup um places you are 

35.43 36.34 A: yes 

37.09 38.02 A: (( yeah )) 

37.40 38.45 B: um 

38.33 38.88 B: (( a )) 

38.72 53.49 B: lot of those are like at least the ones i've seen are not very efficient they're very like i mean a lot of them have been crammed into like little like old buildings or previous businesses and if it was up to me i would combine something like a starbucks and a and there are a couple of places i think there's another one called um 

54.48 57.66 B: do you know of another one there's another one that that i've heard of 

58.38 59.55 B: um 

60.60 70.00 B: i don't remember but it uh i would really make it really elaborate real efficient i'd have couches then i'd have terminals where they could game and like that that would be my 

70.70 74.09 B: you know idea of a really cool business and uh 

74.36 84.20 B: it'd be really neat i mean it'd be like a mood setting the walls would be painted to make it all like you know make you put you in the mood and it it would offer a lot 

83.75 84.76 A: (( [noise] that's )) 

84.79 89.09 A: there's one or two things like that um i know there were a couple 

89.26 90.45 A: um 

91.65 96.68 A: a couple of years ago that went out of business but in um lower manhattan i know there's one or two 

97.04 97.89 B: (( uh-huh )) 

97.13 106.31 A: of these type of places um they're not that elaborate though they're they're just basically terminals and you can get a coffee there but um 

106.41 117.52 B: yeah see that that's that's what the one down here was and they didn't make it and i was really upset 'cause i used to go to it but it didn't make it it it closed down they cram like you know fifteen computers in this little little room 

116.68 117.40 A: (( [cough] )) 

117.60 119.41 A: (( yeah )) 

117.65 128.14 B: and there was junk everywhere and i was thinking you know if i attract more people and it was more appealing and especially if it was a coffee shop you'd try to brought a range of people and bring in more income 

128.49 130.58 B: so that was my 

129.45 132.07 A: what part of flor- i'm sorry what part of florida are you in 

132.21 134.15 B: tampa central 

132.99 133.98 A: okay 

135.54 136.97 B: so what about you 

137.20 142.87 A: um good question i i'm not really sure i think i would um i 

142.89 147.63 A: mean one of the things i really like to do is i like to go to the gym so if i 

147.82 156.25 A: had again if money was no object and they were you know like the question was and something i really enjoyed doing like to open up uh 

156.28 161.43 A: some sort of like twenty four hour gym i think would be great um 

162.01 166.85 A: i know the pitfalls for that especially um here in new york that 

166.86 171.23 A: little by little there there are no independent gyms left 

170.94 174.40 B: yeah that's true they were all knocked out by the you know 

171.32 172.24 A: uh they 

172.45 173.34 A: (( were all )) 

174.65 176.05 B: the larger ones 

175.68 178.81 A: right in fact even like some of the 

179.26 180.86 A: other um [sigh] 

181.36 185.93 A: ones that were independent um like crunch which i've never been to um 

186.49 191.21 A: i know that was taken over by balleys so [cough] um yeah there is 

191.66 195.43 A: but um no it's something i really enjoy i think um 

195.93 200.27 A: yeah i- if i had a way to do it it would be 

200.59 207.42 A: you know not not so much pressure of um uh personal trainers but they would be there not 

207.46 208.45 A: uh 

208.57 212.57 A: just more like salaried employees versus 

212.69 217.53 A: um people there trying to you know always get more clients so 

217.59 218.88 A: um 

218.02 219.70 B: yeah 

219.18 225.07 A: i i think you know that that would be the uh that would be the ideal situation 

225.39 229.60 B: would you have like like a pool area too or would you just be strictly gym 

230.08 232.91 B: like i like water type of creation 

232.10 236.99 A: good good question i i wasn't thinking of putting water in now but um 

236.67 239.86 B: i mean if money wasn't an object i don't see why not i mean 

239.33 246.73 A: that that's true it just i guess i just need a little inspiration there to think that no that that is true that would definitely 

244.78 245.34 B: (( mm )) 

246.83 247.80 A: uh 

246.92 257.28 B: i'm sure once you started sitting down and started planning it out you would come up i mean i'm sure as i would too i mean most people you know you come up with these other idea that you never thought were possible for if money weren't an object 

257.77 258.62 B: (( and and )) 

257.85 259.58 A: right 

258.84 261.43 B: that that's that'd be pretty cool 

262.35 263.31 A: yeah 

262.63 266.60 B: if money money weren't an object you'd be the big dog on the street probably then 

266.64 272.33 A: um well yeah unfortunately [laughter] as we know it that's not the case um 

272.61 279.59 A: yeah but i i was thinking more of maybe a place like more really a place for um 

280.94 289.99 A: like like what you mentioned a pool more of like a a place for middle class people i mean most of the poo- places with swimming pools in new york are 

286.05 286.81 B: yeah 

290.10 293.88 A: upper class except for balleys which is you know 

294.29 297.98 A: they're not they're not that they're like older buildings and 

297.48 298.60 B: yeah 

297.99 300.44 A: older equipment so like um 

300.69 303.92 A: that that's the something you know more for 

303.98 310.01 A: um 'cause we have some really really swank ones here in the city i don't personally go to them um [noise] 

309.43 311.05 B: yeah 

310.93 324.24 B: well that's the only reason why i haven't really joined a gym is because of the prices and and like you said i mean if it it it's just i don't go there enough for the price i mean it's pretty expensive i mean even down here in tampa i mean 

324.07 327.83 B: it's like you know you go to the the temple terrace club one 

327.60 341.52 B: and since it's the one that you know the club it's gonna be more than say an independent one which there's not many of those around and so that like like we already said that that's the problem and that's probably the best idea you know 

341.57 344.75 B: a- appeal to the middle class society then 

344.84 347.63 B: you probably actually end up getting more you know 

348.67 353.19 B: what's the word i'm looking for more people i guess than you would normally 

354.96 362.67 A: yeah a- again that's that's when you it it's just the barriers to entry for 

363.07 363.97 A: (( you know )) 

364.40 366.77 A: uh someone again without 

367.07 375.24 A: you know money without the advertising a- ability that these people have and just basically also the ability to um 

376.27 385.95 A: have uh like like they can give deals you know at at one gym it's like you play that another one you know play that an independent which 

385.97 389.84 A: in in w- you know with your idea it's um 

389.89 399.60 A: you probably wouldn't have uh um the only thing that might come about is that like you know suddenly we have more brand recognition for a start but i don't think uh 

400.10 403.45 A: you know i mean your your type of a business uh 

404.00 409.07 A: you know it it could work i think if you know if if you're just like a the proper um 

409.61 416.14 A: hip quotient from from people i think yeah um i don't see why not 

414.11 415.40 B: (( mm like )) 

415.95 430.38 B: well like the cyber cup belts here it it gave 'em more it gave i mean i i discussed this with people and i i really thought it was a good idea but i don't think it'll ever happen but i just it it's a really good dis- discussion of topic but it it it appealed to the younger 

430.23 442.36 B: you know the younger genre of people because um it it had nothing really to offer offer to the older people and you know it was a little coffee shop but it wasn't it was hardly anything at all i mean it was just like a 

442.15 449.04 B: little coffee thing and a cappuccino machine nothing compared to like a starbucks thing and i wasn't saying mixing an actual starbucks with it but 

449.07 459.20 B: something along the lines you know create your own coffee shop with you know similar characteristics that place makes a killing i mean i'll go there sometimes and i i i like it a lot and 

459.35 466.12 B: you know mixing the two together and putting in like some really good time and effort into it making it so the people or 

465.79 466.38 A: (( [noise] )) 

466.20 475.34 B: older i think it'd really really be good and you know people go to starbucks to to not not even to do 

475.77 481.68 B: not even they go to socialize or sit there and get online and with their own computers i mean 

481.75 484.35 B: have computers there for them already you know 

484.62 497.02 B: and offer things like software that they can't normally get on their computers at home so there's there's appeal you know there's a reason to make them get up out of their speed and come there instead so they come to their home on their computer 

485.58 486.41 A: right 

497.50 501.23 A: so you have like gaming there i- is that what you're 

501.63 502.79 B: i'm sorry 

502.23 504.73 A: lot of gaming computer gaming 

503.61 513.72 B: yeah yeah you know ga- you know have have like the largest selection you can possibly get of games you know and and that that'd be a that'd be a 

513.77 517.76 B: a great way to test out a game before buying it you know 

517.79 531.06 B: people would go there and test it out before they buy i mean i i did that at cyber cup but they only have that many you know games and they had had a limited selection and it worked i mean i liked it but i can only imagine if someone put like the 

518.99 520.40 A: that's a good idea 

530.96 536.77 B: the best effort towards it and really went all out how how great it would be 

536.23 536.82 A: [noise] 

538.14 542.19 A: yeah so you have like play stations around 

541.65 545.09 B: oh yeah i didn't even think about that yeah do that too 

543.92 545.46 A: and x. boxes or 

547.20 548.54 A: yeah i mean 

548.55 551.18 A: i mean the the only thing is you know 

551.43 552.60 A: um 

552.62 559.00 A: you you you'd wanna have some sort of um sort of like you know the 

559.39 563.83 A: the kids don't linger too long i mean you want them around but 

563.91 567.03 B: yeah like time limits 

565.10 566.22 A: (( [noise] there has to )) 

566.56 568.78 A: be crowd control of sorts 

568.67 569.98 B: mhm 

569.38 572.58 A: i mean i remember when x. box had a um 

572.93 576.08 A: first came out microsoft had had a 

576.39 585.37 A: uh an event here in new york and um it was free all weekend and the lines were uh were like i was on line for 

585.43 588.73 A: like five hours when i finally gave up um 

588.04 589.70 B: yeah 

589.00 596.15 A: and the the 'cause exp- they were letting people play free all weekend and people were just not leaving 

596.33 599.89 A: um it was a to be fair it was a freezing night and 

596.64 597.78 B: yeah
