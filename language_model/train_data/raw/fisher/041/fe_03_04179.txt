0.53 1.75 B: (( hello )) 

1.82 5.90 A: uh yeah my name is sri i'm from uh houston uh how are you 

6.13 8.56 B: i'm derek and i'm up here in portland oregon 

8.52 9.60 A: (( [noise] oh okay )) 

9.64 11.49 A: is that nice up there 

11.11 12.63 B: yeah it is actually 

12.37 17.19 A: yeah a friend of mine just moved to oregon i've been meaning to visit i just haven't had a chance yet 

15.94 19.22 B: hm not too bad [laughter] 

17.21 23.36 A: yeah so uh what kind of business would you open up and uh how how do you think you'd do it 

22.44 25.49 B: uh i i would do a couple of different things i've actually 

25.85 31.08 B: [lipsmack] a couple of years ago my wife and i actually owned a small business we owned a comic bookstore 

28.81 29.66 A: uh-huh 

31.01 32.21 A: oh really [laughter] 

31.73 37.52 B: yeah it was when mo- we lived in bosmo montana at the time and we we were had that for about a year and a half and uh 

38.71 44.27 B: the only reason we gave it up is because we moved here to portland and eventually some day i'd like to do it again 

43.62 46.91 A: [noise] i mean was it easy to make money in that kind of bus- 

46.23 49.02 B: absolutely not [laughter] 

47.65 62.25 A: [laughter] it seems like really ha- i mean i worked at a comic bookstore for a little bit and yeah i mean but i i did- i really didn't like to because the owners seemed to be like pressing me to try and convince kids who came in to buy as many comic books as possible and i 

52.29 53.23 B: oh did ya 

62.17 72.30 A: it seemed like all the comic bookstores that i went into when i was a kid were more they're just really relaxed laid back places where you came in and you browsed or you came and went as you pleased and made friends with the owners you know 

70.52 71.78 B: (( yeah )) 

72.54 78.31 B: yeah that that's how i would do it that's how i did do it that's how i'd do it again [laughter] 

76.96 85.30 A: yeah but i mean it seems like businesses that are really i mean are really fun places to be around like i was talking to a friend the other day about a coffee shop 

85.20 99.81 A: um it wasn't a starbucks you know where it's like eat fast in fast out you make money it it's called the spider house in austin and it's got a a large square footage and people sit there for hours and hours maybe buy one or two drinks and i'm just thinking like how does this place 

99.72 102.23 A: pay its its lease [laughter] you know what i mean 

101.70 102.92 B: right 

102.16 111.43 A: because uh i mean those kind of places are just i mean they're wonderful for college students you know to hang out in like a comic bookstore you know like you know the people there who come in regularly but 

111.34 119.15 A: uh i mean how do how do the owners actually like make a profit and it kind of goes against some of the capitalist ideals that they try to [laughter] ingrain in you you know 

118.45 131.05 B: yeah definitely i mean when we when we did our comic bookstore the whole we knew going into it that we weren't going to make any money we did it because we loved the business we loved the hobby of you know comic books 

131.15 132.28 B: and uh 

132.56 138.32 B: we never lost money we always broke even but we never really you know made any money which was fine 

135.26 136.90 A: yeah 

138.29 147.47 A: yeah i mean i mean as long as uh i mean that's the thing i mean if you're living to work then something's wrong with your life [laughter] you know because i don't want my life to occur in the 

147.30 158.73 A: you know four to five hours a day that i have free time you know and maybe after running some errands like you know three hours [laughter] um because i've been working all day trying to make money at something that i don't enjoy you know 

153.67 155.23 B: right 

158.83 160.76 B: that's true that's true 

159.82 171.10 A: i mean uh if i was going to open up a business i mean it would probably be a a language school because that's i mean that's what i'm interested in i love languages i love learning foreign languages and i like teaching english to 

171.02 177.82 A: to the people who don't you know speak english as a native language and and uh i mean i don't know 

175.30 176.34 B: oh wow 

177.64 191.18 A: like honestly uh i'm not so sure i i'd be a successful businessman i think that's probably the only business that i could really put my heart i mean maybe there are a couple of other ones but i mean a friend of mine who was starting his own business was an is an advertising magazine and i 

190.97 202.44 A: mean i really love my friend and i wanted to help him but i mean when i was when i was kind of solving a problem for him i felt good but when he asked me to go out and do sales for the magazine and he's talking about how much money we could make it just didn't 

202.59 214.44 A: it i mean it didn't excite me and it didn't i didn't have any passion for it because i didn't care about this advertising magazine that he did but if i was doing a a language school where every person that came in the door i would be helping them and then 

209.23 210.21 B: right 

214.21 228.12 A: once they got out they could you know i could see them growing like learning and new opportunities as they learned english or whatever foreign language they wanted to learn you know i i think i'd be really happy about it but i don't i don't know if i could you know keep the numbers i'd be you know 

228.48 230.88 A: the dots and dashes and xs and os 

230.90 235.04 A: in line so that i could expand my language school and grow 'til i was the size of 

235.11 237.50 A: [laughter] you know or something like that 

236.15 237.51 B: right 

238.80 243.98 B: yeah that's that's kind of where my head would be too so it would have to be something that i'm passionate about because it's 

245.30 257.93 B: if you're gonna get into it to make a buck i kind of think you're getting into it for the wrong reasons it has to be something that you love something that you're passionate about and if you do it right then eventually you know you know hopefully do well enough that that's all you have to do 

248.99 250.69 A: yeah absolutely 

251.67 253.94 A: (( yeah i think )) 

259.13 264.31 A: i i don't i just don't understand how some people like i mean they own their business like you know like a friend of mine 

264.25 275.40 A: his dad owns this carpet cleaning business and i mean i don't think he really has a passion for carpet cleaning but he's just he was very efficient about it and he expanded and he has a whole fleet and several stores now and like you know they're 

275.44 281.27 A: i mean the whole family in and all their you know relatives are employed by this carpet cleaning business [laughter] i mean 

281.37 291.78 A: i i guess i mean that's a completely different idea to the ideas you know making it on your own and like having something for yourself we're just finding a place for it rather than going out and doing something 

291.73 302.23 A: you know that you really enjoy that you can feel proud of and i mean can he feel proud that he's cleaned so many carpets maybe i i don't know [laughter] [laughter] 

296.31 304.82 B: but [laughter] i i have no idea [laughter] that's so far removed from the way that i i think about how 

304.59 305.61 A: yeah 

304.87 308.35 B: things should be i would have no idea 

307.28 313.43 A: yeah exact- i mean i i think there there is something like different about this way of you know 

313.75 319.67 A: you know trying to be passionate enjoy your work and in what i was taught in school i mean it's seems it seems 

319.78 329.02 A: s- so often in our culture it's pushed into you that you know you gotta drive to succeed and achieve and like if you have more wealth it's because you're a more put together person you know like you 

329.02 332.56 A: you're actually you know a better member of society or something and you 

332.00 333.83 B: right 

332.55 345.97 A: you and i mean if you're not you know if you like you know when people say oh tax cuts should be for the rich because you know the rich are the ones who you know provide support for everybody you know like they achieve more and you're saying you don't want to be rich i'm like well i'm not sure i want to be rich but that's not 

346.03 348.82 A: [laughter] that's not the first thing on my list is being rich 

348.37 352.23 B: right yeah i want to be successful but i don't necessarily want to be rich you know 

351.41 360.76 A: yeah yeah i wanna be happy and i wanna be fulfilled in what i'm doing and i i mean i wanna i wanna help people especially i think if i wasn't helping people whatever job i was doing 

360.95 367.53 A: i think i'd feel there's something lacking i mean i have to go and like do some volunteer work or something on the side that will 

367.95 376.78 A: you know i mean if i could feel that i i wasn't just kind of taking advantage of all this you know this wonderful life that i have when other people have really crappy lives you know 

373.58 374.25 B: (( so )) 

374.97 376.70 B: right 

378.61 387.87 B: yeah okay [laughter] yeah i totally understand that definitely my my wife volunteers and um it's it's partly for that reason as she 

379.96 383.92 A: [noise] [laughter] yeah 

387.19 388.87 A: yeah 

388.48 395.07 B: must contribute i mean she feels it's it's something that drives her you know and i feel the same way i don't have a lot of time to do it right now 

394.85 395.72 A: yeah 

395.12 398.37 B: but i would be in that same kind of situation and 

398.67 402.55 B: yeah i i think you're right if it's more of a matter of being happy as opposed to 

403.43 406.45 B: [lipsmack] you know i mean how many dollars you have at the end of the day 

406.32 408.08 A: yeah i mean i think 

406.83 412.57 B: it's definitely nice but it's not the end all be all at least not for me 

413.99 420.23 A: yeah when with even one of those businesses you know like running a language uh school or a comic bookstore i think 

420.04 433.33 A: everyday i would feel happy opening my store and i i you know would be customers would come in i'd be passion- i'd really wanna help them with what they're doing wh- i i i sold vacuum cleaners door to door for one summer and it was the worst job i've ever done it just 

433.66 444.96 A: it took ate away at my soul you know [laughter] it just would grate on me and i didn't feel happy everyday was a pain i was like okay i gotta go back to gotta go and make some money 'cause i got bills to pay or something you know 

444.92 456.38 A: [laughter] and i don't wanna ever be that way and i think if if if you find something and it's for yourself then uh you you really can be happy you know with the things that you have and and you know 

456.51 460.70 A: just making whatever small contribution or whatever whatever i mean really 

461.16 463.98 A: really ignites a a passion inside you you 

463.76 467.37 B: exactly exactly that that that's the key and i think 

467.43 478.40 B: i think there are way too many people out there who don't know what that is yet haven't figured it out for themselves yet and those are the pe- you can always tell when you walk into a business that's run by somebody like that 

477.19 478.63 A: (( know uh-huh )) 

478.49 480.36 B: 'cause they just 

480.39 483.55 B: you just tell there's a vibe you know they don't act as if 

484.16 486.84 B: they want you to be there kind of thing 

486.02 487.53 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

486.90 500.15 B: a lot of the jobs that i've held have been very retail you know a lot of retail customers reserve a space and i an when i walk into a comic bookstore or into a you know a a a retail establishment and the people there aren't excited about their job you can just tell 

496.27 497.34 A: yeah 

499.66 501.82 A: yeah yeah [laughter] 

500.27 506.65 B: and for me that that's one of the reasons why i want to do my own comic bookstore again is because i haven't i don't feel there's 

508.23 513.91 B: a place that cares enough cares about it enough as as much as i do excuse me about as much as i do 

513.85 515.18 A: yeah yeah 

514.44 521.37 B: and i wan- wanna show 'em how it's done you know i wanna do it right [laughter] 

517.42 523.34 A: yeah see i never like when i look at other people and i say like i when i delivered pizzas for a while i felt like 

523.11 525.44 A: and i could i could organize this but i mean 

525.42 538.54 A: i feel kinda bad in general because i was i was like well if i sell people extra pizza then they're gonna get like i don't know they're gonna get more heart disease and more cholesterol [laughter] and stuff like that i didn't ever really feel good about like trying to [laughter] sell extra pizza but 

534.41 544.11 B: [laughter] 

538.41 548.59 A: i still quite liked the store 'cause he runs out of give ideas on that he sort of worked with me 'cause nobody else there was really thinking about trying to trying to run things better you know [laughter] 

548.39 559.49 A: like do it well i mean there were others like this this is a job you just deliver the pizza why why do you care about it you know and so it seemed like there is there no pride in your work then of course you're gonna have turnover and like you're 

554.60 555.89 B: right 

559.26 569.64 A: not gonna have employees that are you know you can trust or that wanna stay with you for a while i mean a lot a lot of it seems really kinda intuitive to me to like do a job if you're not gonna do it well you know 

569.51 572.28 B: exactly exactly 

569.99 570.93 A: (( and )) 

571.52 580.28 A: i guess there's some people who who actually i mean they still have that drive of money i'm sure bill gates is very passionate about he wants to be the computer 

580.33 588.05 A: like god of the world [laughter] i mean he wanted to change the world some way but he in the process he doesn't mind crushing other people under his foot [laughter] you know 

587.28 590.14 B: [laughter] 

588.08 598.65 A: i mean it's just a different pa- kind of passion than i have i mean but he he obviously i think i think he probably is happy with his life the way it is you know i mean he's i mean probably has his own you know 

598.70 599.89 A: (( he has a more ))
