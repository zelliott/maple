84.35 98.46 A: ah yes uh well i used to kn- know a lady that for a while she was dancing herself and then she decided to go and actually she went to back to school [sigh] to be a teacher and then she was going she wanted to open her own business

101.48 108.20 B: oh yeah no i don't wanna do that if i don't if i'm not doing it like if i get older and i don't do it any more i'm not gonna teach it

108.07 109.52 A: oh i see 

108.96 112.26 B: no [laughter] but you know everybody's different what would you open up 

109.54 111.04 A: (( well that's interesting )) 

112.25 119.28 A: i will well as a matter of fact like as of today i am kind of tired of working in corporate america 

119.32 120.36 B: okay 

119.39 130.75 A: i've been doing customer service for my entire life first in the airline industry now i'm in retail and i am tired of it so actually i am thinking about putting my own business 

122.90 123.66 B: uh-huh 

130.70 131.58 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

130.77 137.01 A: and i have two things in mind one is maybe like a women's consignment store 

137.28 140.99 A: because it's something a women's consignment store 

137.45 138.95 B: (( what is it [noise] )) 

140.40 143.47 B: (( what is that consignment i don't even know what it [noise] )) 

142.21 143.12 A: okay 

143.14 149.90 A: where actually people can bring their clothes that they don't wanna wear any more and i can just put it out for sale 

150.09 152.78 B: (( [noise] oh yeah yeah i understand what it is uh-huh )) 

152.19 154.07 A: have you heard of it 

153.77 156.34 B: yes i i always bring my clothes there 

156.35 157.57 A: oh there we go 

156.38 157.62 B: [noise] like uh 'cause 

157.77 167.04 B: yeah i always give 'em away for free 'cause i feel bad about putting them in the garbage and usually they're not old i usually wear my stuff like twice and then throw it away or three times 

165.78 167.01 A: exactly 

167.05 169.44 B: and then yeah i always give it away 

169.30 170.69 A: yes 

171.02 177.94 A: so that is something that i am looking into doing because the investment is not you don't need a lot of money 

177.99 180.61 A: to you know uh open a business like that one 

180.58 182.27 B: no you don't 

180.72 181.64 A: the other 

181.76 188.46 A: the other thing that i've been thinking of is i have two puppies i have two labradors and i just love them to death i love animals 

187.88 189.37 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

188.69 196.88 A: so maybe looking into a company that will provide a service for any type of service for animals 

196.94 209.49 A: like for example um not necessarily like giving them the grooming or that stuff but here i live in florida here there is a lot of people that will go to your house and if you have a pet will pick up your pet and take them to the beach 

203.10 204.27 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

209.59 210.45 B: uh-huh 

210.19 215.17 A: and just kinda like get their exercise for the day and things like that and they 

214.02 216.15 B: like dog walking kind of like 

215.97 218.55 A: correct correct and um 

217.00 217.89 B: mhm 

218.66 220.29 A: do something like that 

220.18 233.80 A: and but at the same time you know if i can provide other service like the grooming and bathing and feeding and babysitting and the whole nine yards so [sigh] i don't know but you need money for that money that i don't have right now so 

233.32 235.35 B: (( how come you need money for that )) 

236.04 237.19 A: how come what 

237.21 239.72 B: how come you need money for that kind of service 

239.61 245.45 A: well because like for example i will have a special uh i will need a special uh vehicle 

245.34 259.14 A: then i will need to go and get some classes i will have to go back to school and uh learn how to groom you know them and and things like that so um i've been looking already on the internet to get some classes through the internet 

259.13 262.05 A: and uh it's quite expensive 

262.49 263.43 A: you know 

262.55 272.76 B: how come why don't you go to a a pet store where they do grooming and work there like part time for like a couple of months and learn it there and get paid for it 

272.57 282.31 A: no and and i thought about it like uh there was a petsmart a new petsmart by uh where i live and but you need to have some sort of experience or at least a certificate 

278.30 279.35 B: mhm 

282.13 290.98 A: to say that you know you went to school and at least you have an idea what you're doing they won't they won't hire you without a certification that's the problem 

290.76 292.02 B: oh 

291.57 299.75 A: so it will take me like this place that i found on the internet um it will cost over a thousand dollars and it will take me at least six months 

299.99 303.45 A: so i don't wanna wait that long so i don't know i'm just kinda like 

303.81 307.11 A: i guess um just thinking about it 

305.69 307.06 B: (( well you could um )) 

308.16 313.65 B: you could hire somebody who has a certif- certificate and who knows how to do it [sigh] 

314.03 315.68 B: and have them work for you 

314.12 315.08 A: (( that is a )) 

316.01 317.69 A: yes but then all 

317.95 331.62 A: who i was talking the other day the other day i was talking to oh i was telling to my doctor [laughter] and uh he knows me like for many years so he knows everything that goes on with my life so he was asking me well what is it you're gonna do da da da 

331.49 341.44 A: so i said well i'm thinking about this type of business and the first thing that he told me because he owns his own uh you know um i guess business as a doctor he told me 

341.43 342.59 B: mhm 

342.00 346.20 A: go into something where you won't have to hire people 

346.26 356.21 A: because then you have to get into insurance you have to get into payroll then you have to get into all this stuff and he said and believe me he said i've been doing it forever 

346.48 347.49 B: oh yeah 

349.94 351.10 B: oh 

356.16 366.95 A: it is really hard he said get into something where you or maybe your spouse you both can get into it and you both will run it just by yourselves 

366.80 374.34 A: and i think you know like right now things are kind of difficult i mean in in the i guess financially the entire country so 

374.40 379.48 A: [lipsmack] i think it's a good good suggestion what he's telling me so i don't know 

378.17 383.46 B: yeah you're right i never thought of that you're right maybe you should do that i was gonna if you open up a store 

383.29 384.33 A: yes 

383.72 396.55 B: like you said it's gonna you don't need a lot of money up front you're just gonna get some clothes from other people and then you just open the store whenever you you know you you have time to do it and you're gonna be the only one running the store 

384.98 385.88 A: uh-huh 

387.58 388.73 A: exactly 

394.43 395.40 A: yeah 

396.65 410.97 A: like right now uh i work i work for home depot that is my regular job but on saturdays i met this lady uh she has a consignment store and i'm helping her on saturdays just to learn the business and it is let me tell you it is 

408.21 409.57 B: mhm 

411.39 416.46 A: i mean well you have to like any business you have to build your clientele 

416.43 417.73 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

416.92 429.80 A: and be able you know to wait for maybe a year or so while you do that and people will come into your store and will get to know you and will see what type of clothes you carry uh and will come back um 

421.36 422.98 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

429.73 434.53 A: she she's been telling me that it took her quite a while to 

435.35 442.58 A: get a reputation and people to come back but she has regulars i mean she has people that will go there every single saturday 

442.39 443.75 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] of course 

442.52 454.23 A: i mean ev- at the same time you know and they will just check what did she receive that week and they always buy stuff and things like that and and at the same time it's kind of fun because you meet people 

454.56 462.53 A: [lipsmack] and uh old lad- old little ladies you know that want to buy purses every weekend and things like that so it's kinda like a cute business 

462.56 464.19 A: and so especially if you 

462.97 471.87 B: [noise] maybe you can also do it you know like for the first time you you still work at home depot maybe four days a week and three days a week you open the store and see how it goes 

471.91 473.38 A: exactly 

472.01 473.34 B: and the busier 

473.39 475.37 B: yeah that that'd be good 

475.32 486.04 A: something like that i don't know but you need to you know so your plan is to i guess apply for a job for a company or something and do that what you wanna do with your dancing 

486.67 497.69 B: no um no no no no i'm i'm more i'm a a songwriter singer and i publish songs i'm working on new material right now [mn] and um 

493.28 494.65 A: oh okay 

498.47 505.83 B: i'm actually working on um getting a a deal as an artist with a uh a company 

505.74 506.78 A: okay 

506.53 511.53 B: but i'm working on my own songs right now that's what what my plan is right now 

511.48 514.37 A: oh i see how interesting 

514.63 519.92 B: so um the dancing is just it's just part of of me as an entertainment package 

514.64 515.79 A: and did you have a 

519.59 520.78 A: correct 

520.54 525.55 B: but um i'm no- i don't wanna be in a dance company or anything no i i'm 

524.49 526.25 A: oh i see 

525.50 537.95 B: i i i'm trying to market myself more um with my songs and then i'm also gonna do a video where i'm gonna do a choreography to these songs in order to um get a deal as as an artist 

537.58 538.79 A: correct 

538.04 540.11 B: that's what i'm yeah that's what i'm doing 

539.97 541.06 A: do you sing 

541.46 545.92 B: yeah i sing and i dance and i write songs

544.34 546.51 A: are you good [laughter] 

546.52 552.41 B: yeah it well it's different i do like a talk singing it's kinda like between rap and singing 

552.23 553.38 A: okay 

553.78 557.08 B: so it's kinda like um yeah that's what i do 

557.44 564.11 A: uh have you have you thought about going to like a those shows now that uh how is it american idol or 

563.06 570.30 B: no because they're looking for a different type of artist what they're looking for is more for like um really singer singers 

569.95 571.32 A: oh i see 

570.73 581.19 B: uh like like really vocalists and that's not what i do my music is more um [lipsmack] more attitude it's more aggressive it's it's it it wouldn't fit in these shows 

574.01 575.01 A: i see 

581.12 584.60 A: that i see oh okay makes sense yeah 

581.59 582.41 B: so 

583.38 591.34 B: but otherwise i would've applied there but no that it was was not really what i was looking for like i mean i i don't think they're looking for me at these shows 

588.09 589.07 A: yeah 

590.53 599.11 A: [laughter] yeah definitely you need to go to a place where you know you're gonna you're gonna be appreciated and at least heard
