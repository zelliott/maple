28.10 31.82 B: um i was thinking like kinda like a 

32.64 42.78 B: country club but not really a country club but like in a urban setting like in a city setting with like multi-levels but that's kinda outrageous so 

38.20 39.18 A: uh-huh 

40.42 41.16 A: (( huh )) 

41.48 44.02 A: that's that's actually i work in one of those 

43.49 44.62 B: oh you do 

44.08 50.50 A: yeah it's it's ten stories it's a private like a country club but it's in new york city 

44.63 46.48 B: oh okay [laughter] 

49.93 63.54 B: oh okay oh you're in new york oh okay see in california we don't have a lot of those and if they are they're outside but i'm talking about one like that's inside like on the first floor is like 

51.84 52.88 A: yeah 

58.45 59.42 A: right 

63.76 71.62 B: exercise equipment the second floor is like a juice bar like inside basketball courts and everything but it's gonna be like in the city 

71.70 74.19 A: yeah that's a good idea 

73.79 75.16 B: yeah huh 

75.68 81.54 B: but i don't know how the i don't know i mean i know how to go about doing that but 

81.74 84.53 B: i don't know that's just a big dream [laughter] 

84.08 87.07 A: [laughter] yeah 

86.71 89.43 B: oh so what would you do if you could open your own business 

88.53 92.04 A: um i would probably open a recording studio 

91.56 96.70 B: oh a recording studio of oh where you record music uh-huh what kind 

92.88 94.20 A: yeah 

94.87 95.99 A: yeah 

96.28 99.58 A: um any kind of music um 

98.29 99.52 B: (( oh okay oh )) 

100.05 113.89 A: but i think that it would have to be some like a lot of studios i've been in are they're not very comfortable settings the atmosphere isn't very good i'd focus on making it very atmospheric so that it provides a 

114.25 121.75 A: a comfortable setting to do your recording and stretch yourself you know and couches and i don't know and 

121.18 122.73 B: (( okay )) 

121.78 128.51 A: t._v._d. t._v. video games i mean whatever so you can relax in between and stuff [sigh] 

128.56 130.13 A: and uh 

130.60 131.69 A: i don't know 

132.80 136.07 B: 'cause i know you're there for like long periods of time right 

135.56 139.85 A: that yeah extremely long periods of time and like there's times where uh 

137.42 139.11 B: yeah 

139.93 149.40 A: you've you know you'll have six hours where you don't need to do anything but you may need to do something at any minute so you need to be there but you gotta entertain yourself so 

146.65 147.38 B: [laughter] 

148.86 150.68 B: (( oh okay right )) 

150.26 151.22 A: um 

151.80 156.59 A: you know maybe like a little coffee bar or something in it espresso bar or something 

154.69 155.97 B: yeah 

156.93 158.56 B: oh okay 

158.86 161.63 B: and have you done the research on it or 

161.50 168.69 A: um yeah actually me and w- the my college roommate were gonna open one but we had problems with the financing 

168.65 170.64 B: oh okay [noise] 

169.49 176.58 A: um but yeah we like researched how to design it so that to get the best sound and everything and uh 

177.10 184.81 A: you know i i pretty much know all the equipment i would need and everything it's just a matter of actually doing it getting the financing together 

184.98 190.99 B: okay and then you like have to um draw up what it is a plan or s- a plan 

189.60 192.92 A: yeah you draw up a business plan um 

193.25 197.56 A: you take it to the bank or whatever whoever's financing you and then um 

198.83 201.65 A: i don't know then you start building it i guess 

201.13 203.13 B: (( [laughter] okay oh )) 

202.64 211.63 A: um it would have to be i'd wanna do it in new york because there's such a high you know demand for studio recording in new york city 

211.34 212.54 B: okay 

211.67 218.75 A: uh it'd be harder to do in a more rural area but um i think it would be successful in new york 

215.44 217.02 B: yeah 

218.45 221.97 B: yeah and then like you would charge the 

221.98 224.59 B: people per hour or something like that 

223.07 229.87 A: yeah you charge by the hour and um you can do it you can rent out an engineer as well to d- do the actual recording 

229.63 230.63 B: (( oh okay )) 

229.96 234.11 A: but that's a lot more but if you just rent the studio space um 

234.94 237.63 A: [noise] people bring their own engineers or whatever 

237.03 238.16 B: (( oh okay )) 

238.06 249.71 A: it's good though 'cause if it's the sort of thing if you get a reputation for being able to get good sound quality uh like the acoustics are good and everything then you know you'll get some ma- major level interest and 

243.86 244.89 B: uh-huh 

249.81 256.63 A: um you'll get big stars that'll come there consistently because they like the way they sound in those rooms or whatever 

256.04 257.40 B: oh okay 

257.81 258.68 B: okay 

259.78 264.42 B: yeah 'cause actually my mom is thinking about studying business 

263.96 264.98 A: (( uh-huh )) 

264.53 273.59 B: 'cause there is a empty lot across the street from our house and she was gonna do like a car uh coffee bean or a starbucks 

273.31 274.30 A: (( uh-huh )) 

273.64 276.52 B: because there is like a city college nearby 

276.17 278.12 A: oh that's a good idea 

277.57 292.18 B: yeah so i i went on the website to find out about franchising or like owning your own business and like a lot of people are not franchising right now because they're working on international franchising 

285.02 286.12 A: (( right )) 

291.58 293.25 A: right right 

292.82 295.81 B: so they're not even frani- like if you wanna if 

296.11 308.80 B: you want a franchise in canada or mexico that's fine but if you wanna do it in california or even in the united states then they're not doing it so [sigh] we're having a lotta problems with that like finding somebody to 

303.99 305.20 A: yeah 

309.27 314.37 B: you know who wants to franchise because a lot of people don't wanna franchise they're working on international 

314.43 315.71 A: right 

315.28 316.37 B: so 

317.31 322.15 B: and then also you have to give something for the area then when you draw up the proposal 

322.18 325.06 B: you have to make sure you have your um 

326.15 327.30 B: (( your )) 

327.34 334.66 B: your target group that you're gonna be selling to so it's kinda hard to figure out what can you put right there 

334.70 337.03 B: so that's what we're trying to figure out now 

336.64 338.03 A: right 

337.41 348.30 B: 'cause she thought a coffee shop would be good 'cause it's not like you have to sit down and eat but i don't know i don't know if you guys have coffee bean or starbucks up there but a lotta the college students go there and they sit and they drink 

344.78 345.59 A: yeah 

347.66 348.83 A: right 

348.21 354.96 B: and they do homework so you don't have to eat and you can you know you have a place where you can sit and do homework 

354.81 355.93 A: right 

355.29 361.42 B: and not like get food all over your um homework or whatever so we thought it was a good place for it 

361.03 368.13 A: you know what would be a good idea i know they have 'em on a lot on the east coast but i haven't seen too much in california is uh 

366.54 367.52 B: oh 

368.16 370.61 A: just p- put a drive through on it 

370.03 371.04 B: uh-huh 

370.63 374.42 A: so people just drive up in the morning on the way to work or whatever and get their coffee 

372.92 382.50 B: yeah yeah a- 'cause actually what was across street was a mcdonalds and the mcdan- the mcdonalds already had a drive through so we were gonna do was gonna keep the drive through 

377.20 378.14 A: (( uh-huh )) 

382.14 389.44 A: yeah it'd be like that you make so much money just from people not having to get out of their car and walk in to get a cup of coffee in the morning 

385.70 387.40 B: the drive through yeah 

388.59 396.70 B: yeah yeah we were actually gonna keep the drive through and i would have the drive through on there 'cause the building's already there they just probably need to renovate it 

396.41 397.36 A: uh-huh 

396.55 407.57 B: and the drive through's like there it comes in one side and goes up the other and you just keep going or you could either turn around in the parking lot 'cause it's big enough and then just go back out the same way you came in 

408.67 413.72 B: it's like you don't have to you don't have to end up back on the main street get in up on the side street 

413.44 414.80 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

415.32 421.08 B: so we're having a hard time and that and she that's all she wants to put right there is a coffee shop 

421.37 429.30 B: [laughter] and there is like a ihop across the street so therefore you know you can drink coffee here and get something here and then go 

428.89 430.12 A: (( uh-huh [noise] right right )) 

429.54 435.35 B: eat at the coff- i mean you know got eat at ihop or whatever so i thought that was a good idea but 

435.62 438.69 B: [laughter] as as a matter of fact uh 

438.97 442.15 B: coffee starbucks does not even franchise 

442.02 443.19 A: really 

442.61 450.69 B: yes it [laughter] 'cause in california they're popping up all over the place like every corner like a nail shop and a liquor store 

450.22 451.10 A: yeah 

450.87 457.36 B: and so i thought they'd franchise because there are so many popping up but come to find out they don't even franchise at all 

456.93 458.55 A: [noise] wow [noise] 

458.65 460.27 B: (( so i just thought that was )) 

460.57 461.96 A: yeah that's crazy 

461.53 463.44 B: (( i thought that was weird )) 

463.45 464.59 A: (( it is [noise] )) 

466.24 467.14 A: so 

466.28 467.14 B: (( so )) 

467.90 470.17 A: i don't i don't remember what the other uh 

470.70 473.33 A: questions were that they asked but 

472.72 477.28 B: i think it was like how would you start it if money wasn't a object 

477.61 480.88 A: [noise] [noise] yeah that it's the biggest object though 

480.45 481.75 B: [laughter] 

480.98 487.10 A: really that's i think you know everyone would own their own business if uh they had the money to [mn] 

486.54 488.64 B: yeah and nobody would be working 

487.95 490.95 A: yeah no one wants to work for someone someone else 

490.38 492.46 B: [mn] yeah huh 

493.63 494.67 A: but um 

494.99 499.32 B: (( yeah 'cause i was like my ultimate goal is to own my own business but )) 

500.33 511.32 B: i don't know you have to work before you um you know you have to work in order you know to build up some type of collateral so that's the only thing it's like if you start working 

511.68 517.27 B: it's like are you gonna get stuck working where you're at [laughter] or whatever just to get some collateral 

514.54 518.35 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah right right [noise] [noise] )) 

518.42 519.42 B: so 

519.85 522.46 B: that's the only thing about it and then like business 

522.52 533.36 B: like out here um in the u._c. system there are like so many business classes that you have to take just to get a business degree it doesn't even make any sense 

533.05 534.46 A: right 

534.62 542.49 B: it's like all type of accounting basically just like a whole of math and i don't wanna do a whole lotta math or that's why i switched out of the business program 

542.34 544.02 A: (( yeah )) 

543.46 546.00 B: (( i was like i don't think i wanna do math )) 

545.80 547.00 A: [sigh] 

547.42 551.51 A: yeah i don't know you could also just hire an accountant to do it all for you yeah 

550.90 556.79 B: [laughter] yeah but then they could be taking your money and i don't think you'd know 

557.38 559.72 B: that's the only thing about that 

559.00 561.24 A: yeah 

562.25 566.61 B: and then just like knowing how to get the business started it'd be good for that 

566.30 567.88 A: right 

568.33 578.52 A: [lipsmack] i think the beginning would be the hardest part once you open a business um just to get it going get it established and you'd have to advertise a lot 

577.91 588.94 B: [noise] yeah see that's one thing about franchising i mean there are stricter rules and they do get a percentage of your profit but they help you do everything they advertise they 

584.16 585.35 A: right 

586.65 587.90 A: (( right they )) 

588.19 591.51 A: especially like a starbucks or something it's so well known that 

589.59 590.90 B: yeah 

591.76 593.74 A: you know people would go there 

593.68 599.89 B: like they set up your decor get a interior designer they have a specialist
