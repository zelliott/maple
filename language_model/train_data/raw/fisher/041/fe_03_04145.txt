36.35 38.32 B: you know they have a lot of um [lipsmack]

56.09 58.41 A: [cough] um

65.65 67.77 B: right you have to look into it and see 

67.08 69.91 A: yeah yeah you have to look into it because 

70.57 71.74 A: you know 

72.14 78.18 A: what can you sell that's unique and people need that they don't it's not already- it's not already out there 

78.14 81.03 B: right or put a twist on something that's already uh

83.75 85.17 B: better what

87.06 88.85 B: right 

88.93 91.61 B: reinvent the wheel but put like a spin on it 

91.03 94.58 A: that's right that's a good term reinvent the wheel 

91.94 92.88 B: [laughter] 

94.41 98.72 B: [laughter] but if you s- if you market it or package it in a different way 

98.57 100.83 A: mhm mhm 

101.32 102.10 B: um 

101.40 102.59 A: (( yeah [cough] )) 

102.89 104.13 B: 'cause i mean 

104.39 114.98 B: it's supposed to be like almost everyone's dream or whatever to have your own business the one thing that sucks about working for other people is you know going by all their rules and stuff [laughter] 

114.29 116.65 A: that's right what kinda work do you do 

116.36 118.24 B: i'm a teacher what about you yep oh 

117.25 118.44 A: you're a teacher 

118.97 121.68 A: um i work for a bank 

122.69 127.82 A: in purchasing and i negotiate contracts with technology vendors 

127.22 128.28 B: okay 

129.19 131.28 B: like lending contracts or 

131.34 133.55 A: no more like um [sigh] 

133.70 140.70 A: let's say with i._b._m. we have to buy like a thousand mainframes or a couple of thousand servers or 

141.09 145.87 A: uh microsoft you know desktop licenses 

145.28 146.57 B: right 

146.31 155.89 A: um or consulting firms where we need to engage a company to come in for a year and tell us how to do things right that sort of thing um 

155.29 156.24 B: gotcha 

157.20 158.73 A: what grade do you teach 

158.43 162.45 B: uh i teach high school kids that kids that like left school like 

159.90 160.71 A: yeah 

162.93 168.94 B: either you know basically either dropped out or some kind of circumstance like kept them from finishing 

168.20 168.99 A: oh 

169.29 170.16 B: so 

169.85 173.19 A: okay so you probably have tougher kids 

172.58 175.28 B: right it's called the at risk population 

174.92 176.10 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

175.56 181.10 B: um yeah i mean if in terms of the question like well i don't remember all this details but 

181.17 183.98 B: like i said my motivation for starting the business 

184.01 189.13 B: would be sort of so you don't have to go by someone else's like hierarchy like you know be 

187.35 189.07 A: (( mhm )) 

189.23 191.55 A: right so you wanna be your own boss 

191.68 196.19 A: and kinda make your own rules and do your own thing and be independent and 

195.55 197.44 B: that would be my reason yeah 

196.84 199.46 A: yeah that's a pretty good motivation 

199.30 208.02 B: and the other thing would be i'd wanna have a business based on something that isn't necessarily a need but more of like a want 

207.45 208.64 A: mhm 

208.12 211.05 B: um and i don't know exactly what it would be but i mean 

211.19 220.22 B: more along the lines of like entertainment or leisure as opposed to like something that like you know is opposed to like a medical service or something tied to food although 

214.29 215.01 A: mhm 

220.65 221.61 B: you know 

222.55 224.08 A: yeah um [lipsmack] 

224.75 226.43 A: for myself 

226.83 233.81 A: i would probably wanna leverage you know the baby boom population of which i am one 

233.56 235.29 B: right 

234.49 238.63 A: and a lot of people are into wellness nowadays 

238.67 239.55 A: you know 

239.53 240.63 B: right 

240.01 244.45 A: being fit being healthy having a good quality of life 

244.66 251.42 A: that sort of thing but they don't always have the discipline to pursue that or know how to do it you know 

251.24 252.08 B: right 

251.50 256.31 A: and they don't wanna spend hours on the internet doing research and finding out you know what are 

256.41 261.79 A: what are the real healthy foods and what to stay away from and uh you know what kind of exercise 

261.81 273.00 A: they should pursue so i think i might to something like that more of a uh consultant business [cough] kind of kind of doing the legwork and setting up programs for people 

268.17 269.24 B: right 

272.91 274.47 B: that's a good idea 

273.86 275.49 A: yeah and um [sigh] [lipsmack] 

276.05 280.89 A: i probably want to target the higher incomes just like you said a minute ago 

280.67 282.02 B: right 

281.60 283.20 A: because um 

284.23 291.67 A: you know they're the ones who will probably want to invest more and it's more discretionary income 

291.92 295.60 A: it's not like taking the money away from the electric bill 

295.46 296.43 B: right 

295.85 298.53 A: or the house payment or that sort of thing you know 

298.94 301.59 A: because those people you know living you know 

302.39 304.31 A: um [lipsmack] 

304.39 306.06 B: yeah paycheck to paycheck 

304.64 308.98 A: stret- trying to stretch their paycheck they're not gonna wanna do something like this usually so yeah 

308.35 309.68 B: right 

309.74 316.87 A: so i think um that's probably what i would do and i think she said that uh money was unlimited 

314.91 316.01 B: not an 

316.27 318.10 B: right 

316.88 318.07 A: (( alright so mhm )) 

318.68 319.75 B: yeah i mean 

319.84 324.73 B: all different businesses require i guess different amounts of money for startup and um 

325.22 332.36 B: you know i would assume that certain businesses like it takes it's quicker to get to even and then you start making profit however 

331.89 332.99 A: yeah 

332.37 336.74 B: you know uh there's a different you know nature of all different businesses 

336.85 337.75 B: um 

337.30 338.16 A: sure 

337.81 338.64 B: if you 

338.55 352.01 B: i would want it tied to i think status because i think people that wanna use their money to acquire status like use their money in like a haphazard way [laughter] so i'd wanna be like providing that [laughter] i don't know it's sort of like 

351.91 355.67 B: i'd be catering to people that are way different than my own outlook on life 

355.58 356.82 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

356.04 357.59 B: you see what i mean like 

357.93 359.39 B: i think um 

357.99 358.78 A: (( yeah mm )) 

360.36 364.85 B: cigarettes and stuff like that are evil and yet i own stock in phillip morris so 

365.10 365.96 A: yeah 

365.21 369.25 B: i don't know [laughter] like i'm benefiting from other people's addiction 

368.82 369.38 A: (( [cough] )) 

369.34 370.53 B: [laughter] 

369.41 371.64 A: that's a good that's a good point 

371.81 374.29 A: people make a conscious choice however 

374.07 376.80 B: yeah exactly that that's what i think 

376.20 377.38 A: yeah yeah 

377.19 383.61 B: i mean it's a product that you know is unhealthy going in and and they don't just do cigarettes but 

380.79 381.88 A: that's right 

383.22 384.87 A: right they do other things 

384.93 396.36 A: and at the same time you know it is is a big business and it keeps people working provides people jobs and helps the economy and so you know i guess you could say those are benefits 

395.96 396.97 B: right 

396.39 399.63 A: to a phillip morris or a reynolds tobacco or what have you 

399.51 405.45 B: right and cigarettes and alcohol like they're as american as television or like anything else 

404.18 405.07 A: mhm 

405.11 406.09 A: right 

405.47 411.08 B: actually throughout the whole work like in europe more people smoke in europe than in america so 

410.74 411.85 A: that's true mhm 

411.26 422.22 B: it seems like by percentage at least anyway yes so that's another thing about business like if you uh uh certain businesses that are related to vices and stuff seem like [laughter] pretty uh 

422.42 424.93 B: lucrative like gambling [laughter] 

424.64 425.53 A: (( right )) 

425.26 427.66 B: although the government seems to have like a 

428.02 430.03 B: a hand you know in terms of 

430.53 433.02 B: taxes and all that stuff with gambling 

432.69 434.23 A: sure sure i 

433.79 434.67 B: (( you know )) 

435.11 442.43 A: mean the government you know if something is taxable they're gonna be there putting a tax on it and getting their getting their cut 

442.36 444.05 B: right 

444.39 450.65 A: in terms of my business i probably wanna start out small kind of in a local area but expand it 

451.03 455.46 A: um to more regional or even national 

456.87 460.53 A: uh try to build it up slowly i suppose and 

462.36 463.23 A: you know 

463.29 464.58 B: right what 

465.07 466.06 B: yeah i mean 

466.19 469.39 B: one thing i'd wanna avoid although it seems like it's in 

469.43 480.01 B: an inevitable thing about business these days is becoming like starbucks like becoming it seems like and i read about this mcdonalds is sort of the uh blueprint for this like 

480.26 483.29 B: having identical franchises everywhere 

482.88 484.14 A: (( uh right )) 

483.52 484.95 B: like i'd wanna 

485.24 491.41 B: i'd wanna try to that's why i probably wouldn't wanna to grow too big 'cause when you grow big you have to sort of become that 

490.79 491.64 A: true 

491.99 501.14 A: so you wanna avoid the franchise mentality and keep it more of a like a niche and unique and and sort of small uh uh 

499.56 501.42 B: right 

502.24 507.63 B: but i mean see a lot of people probably start out like that but then the temptation to grow 

507.31 508.64 A: mhm 

507.90 512.68 B: um and the way to grow most efficiently and profitably is 

512.70 514.11 B: to go that route 

513.94 515.14 A: (( yeah )) 

514.92 523.00 B: to make like these carbon clone copies of your business right and that that's what america is now like every [laughter] 

517.94 519.65 A: sure cookie cutter 

522.68 527.20 A: sure well that's right i mean america has become very standardized 

523.10 524.01 B: you go 

527.28 529.42 A: and we we try to 

529.52 533.80 A: kind of conform i guess to to norms and standards and 

534.51 535.96 A: things like that 

535.34 536.78 B: right things that you 

537.00 543.55 B: that you can expect and that you can rely on like i'm from philadelphia and i've traveled in a bunch of places and you 

539.02 539.88 A: (( that's right mhm )) 

543.44 552.09 B: know i've been to denver i've been out to california i've been and then you see like a home depot or a lowes and you like associate that like they have those in your town 

552.28 553.11 A: sure 

552.41 555.48 B: like not just mcdonalds but like t- you know everything 

555.78 557.15 B: so but 

555.90 557.88 A: that's right [cough] 

557.35 558.49 B: i don't know 

559.03 561.81 B: i'd wanna try to avoid that i think 

561.03 562.86 A: mhm mhm 

563.11 565.37 A: and i suppose the advantage 

565.68 575.09 A: to that is you know what you're gonna get when you go to a home depot in denver and you're gonna get the same as what you get in philadelphia same as what you get in charlotte 

574.50 575.77 B: right 

575.30 577.97 A: you know 'cause they're all the same they're all cookie cutter 

578.11 580.73 A: so in that way there's no surprises 

581.40 584.35 A: and there's consistency okay 

583.12 586.00 B: right that's why they're based like that 

584.97 588.25 A: yeah yeah um [lipsmack] 

589.12 590.05 B: um 

590.04 594.41 A: hm how old are you if you don't mind my asking twenty eight okay 

592.46 593.56 B: twenty eight 

594.04 595.01 B: (( how 'bout you )) 

595.04 596.51 A: fifty one 

596.30 597.02 B: oh 

597.14 598.35 B: i think i 

598.63 599.89 B: i'm an old twenty eight
