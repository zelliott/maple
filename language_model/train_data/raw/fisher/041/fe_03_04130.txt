0.17 1.29 B: hello 

1.02 2.14 A: (( hello )) 

2.08 3.83 B: hi my name's connie 

3.63 5.49 A: connie my name is charlene 

5.87 9.60 B: okay you wanna start or you want me [laughter] 

7.71 10.97 A: doesn't matter i've never done one of these it's my first time 

10.19 13.49 B: [cough] me neither so go go ahead [laughter] 

11.63 12.43 A: oh 

12.76 18.82 A: [laughter] okay um so i guess if i would open a home business i would probably do bookkeeping 

19.00 19.74 A: ah 

19.06 21.16 B: oh did it say a home business 

20.81 23.35 A: yeah i thought that's what it said what did yours say 

23.79 24.63 B: i 

25.05 30.77 B: well i don't know if it said home [laughter] or not i was in the middle of brushing my teeth so i didn't get it all [mn] 

28.87 29.73 A: (( [mn] )) 

30.07 36.63 A: [laughter] i thought it was if you were gonna do some sort of business or maybe it wasn't home maybe it was just if you were gonna start your own business what would it be 

35.48 37.46 B: that that's what i thought 

37.07 46.53 A: yeah maybe i would do it out of the home i guess is what i'm saying too is i would do mine out of the home as a bookkeeping stuff that's what i have my education in and stuff like that so 

46.81 51.40 A: [lipsmack] but um and i've thought about doing that in the past when my kids are starting to go to school 

51.47 55.90 A: but um and i don't know how successful i'd be i guess it would depend on how much you would 

56.54 59.99 A: you know get the word out there and stuff like that 

59.55 60.76 B: yeah 

60.10 62.85 A: yeah but what a- 

61.92 64.22 B: i don't know if i was to do one 

64.50 70.01 B: i don't know i worked retail for fifteen years so i guess it would have to be some kind of a 

66.59 67.66 A: (( oh okay )) 

70.85 72.13 B: maybe a little 

72.47 75.93 B: mom and pop type store little grocery store or something 

74.20 75.24 A: right 

75.60 76.67 A: yeah 

76.80 81.51 A: right would you have things like that in your area like where you live right now [noise] 

77.37 78.35 B: that would be 

82.04 84.48 B: well there's one down the street but 

83.65 84.77 A: oh yeah right 

85.06 90.94 B: it's been there for years but [sigh] i don't know 'cause that's about all i've ever done was retail 

86.79 87.72 A: (( yeah right )) 

90.60 92.39 A: mhm yeah 

91.66 99.16 B: although i could always open a bar [laughter] my husband's good at shooting pool a pool hall that there 

94.47 95.27 A: yeah 

98.31 100.39 A: [laughter] oh pool there you go 

100.04 101.19 B: yeah he can 

100.60 103.73 A: open a local pool hall yeah the other thing 

102.76 104.11 B: he'd like that 

103.77 114.13 A: yeah hm cool the other thing i've often thought of maybe doing is i worked at a floral shop one time and they always put together like the fruit baskets and different gift baskets 

113.81 114.93 B: yeah 

114.51 124.27 A: and so i would try and do maybe something like that where you put together different gift baskets and different things like that but that would be the other option that i might try and do sometime but 

124.47 126.13 A: (( but yeah )) 

125.37 128.69 B: yeah my my husband's a truck driver he keeps wanting to 

128.97 129.96 A: okay 

129.32 134.33 B: buy his own truck and you know try to start his own business that way and 

133.99 135.20 A: yeah 

134.60 137.97 B: i guess then i would be basically like working out of the home 

137.74 138.74 A: mhm 

138.02 141.67 B: 'cause i would be handling all the accounts and stuff 

141.02 143.80 A: the accounts and stuff like [noise] that yeah yeah 

144.38 144.94 B: (( [mn] )) 

145.15 151.70 A: well i wish they would repeat the questions that would have been helpful again when you're in the middle of the conversation [laughter] i should have wrote them down 

151.63 155.97 B: yeah well i remember the successful part i don't remember the other one yeah 

155.34 158.53 A: yeah yeah i don't know how successful 

158.60 170.40 A: i mean i'm somewhat motivated but at the same time i don't know how much i would wanna go pursue hard col- hard core like knocking on doors or you know that cold calling stuff i'm not i don't really like doing that 

170.67 183.06 A: so i don't know how i mean i guess if advertising would bring it in it would be okay but if i'd have to go knocking or doing a lot of cold calls i don't know if i'd be very successful [laughter] but yeah hm 

183.30 193.01 B: that's like if he ever did a truck business my main concern 'cause i always try to steer him off of that conversation because you have to pay for your own 

190.88 191.87 A: yeah 

193.10 197.65 B: health insurance and for a family of four that's kinda high [laughter] yeah 

194.29 195.56 A: oh okay 

197.02 202.11 A: that is when you're on your own doing that that's true for sure yeah 

202.07 215.85 A: [sigh] yeah yeah i guess that's one downfall if you try and do your own business like as a husband and wife yeah you're on your own for doing all that healthcare and all that stuff and then you don't have that benefit of the larger companies or stuff like that 

202.28 203.45 B: but that 

215.87 219.63 A: that would be a downfall of doing it as a family based business 

215.95 216.66 B: (( yeah )) 

219.89 223.05 A: rather than just one partner doing it i suppose but 

224.13 225.02 A: (( yeah )) 

226.38 227.36 B: (( those are those )) 

226.66 227.23 A: (( hm )) 

227.42 235.83 B: are probably the only ones i can think about doing i know a lot of people get on the computer and you might as well say they have business when they get on that ebay but [laughter] 

235.02 245.20 A: yeah that's i've heard about people doing that but i'm thinking well i don't know where i'd find things to sell on ebay [laughter] but yeah i know that's something that people have done with the computer stuff 

245.37 252.21 A: i i mean i'm able to do things on the computer but i don't know if i could make any money using the computer as a means of 

252.54 265.79 A: you know trying to do that but it would be a good way to advertise let's say if i was doing a business though like you know with the bookkeeping or your you know mom and pop store too well maybe not a mom and pop bookkeeping might help to get the word out there a bit somehow maybe 

265.12 266.49 B: (( yeah but trucking if )) 

266.57 267.48 A: yeah 

266.75 268.75 B: it was a trucking business it would 

268.13 269.13 A: yeah 

269.49 270.25 A: hm 

270.17 272.04 B: (( work 'cause then )) 

270.84 271.94 A: (( all that would work )) 

272.15 273.84 B: you have to use the computer 

273.85 276.98 B: to go and see about getting your loads and stuff 

276.37 279.49 A: that's right yeah that's right yeah 

278.92 283.99 B: 'cause um i don't know too much about trucking only what he tells me but 

283.32 284.67 A: (( yeah right )) 

284.06 288.27 B: he claims there's money to be made i mean he makes good money but 

288.98 292.50 B: for a owner operator he claims there's money to be made for that 

291.63 298.77 A: oh okay yeah i guess there's people always looking for people to you know drive the trucks or drive the trailers somewhere so 

298.88 299.63 A: hm 

300.74 308.11 B: yeah yeah he used to always say everybody can go out of business lose their jobs but they always need somebody to haul the stuff [laughter] 

307.12 311.93 A: that's true yeah they gotta bring the stuff somewhere and get it to people somehow so that's true 

311.90 315.14 B: well i guess actually had the money that would probably be a 

315.38 317.48 B: good business to try to start up 

316.51 319.63 A: to try and get into yeah yeah i'm just 

320.57 323.86 B: somebody's gotta pay to get it from point a to point b. i guess 

323.62 326.46 A: trying that's true yeah 

326.96 335.42 A: the other business i might do i mean i don't know if you'd call it a business but i would do maybe like a day home where i would take in kids 

335.60 349.96 A: um that i could see myself doing sometime down the road too while the 'cause then it's at least hours when the kids are my kids are in school or whatever it's not you know evenings and weekends kinda thing 'cause i wouldn't i wouldn't want my evenings and weekends taken up by some sort of job 

349.91 353.52 A: i'd still want those free in the sense of having some sort of family 

353.65 363.21 A: life with my husband and stuff so i'd try and keep it so my evenings and weekends were free but where babysitting or daycare a day home would you know be a little bit better that way but 

363.36 364.27 B: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

364.09 365.28 A: (( yeah )) 

365.70 372.60 B: i've always i've been looking in the papers to see if people need people to babysit and stuff yeah that kind of stuff 

370.73 371.91 A: oh yeah 

372.29 374.38 A: mhm yeah 

373.82 380.25 B: i don't know i have a daughter that's almost two so i don't know if i wanna throw any more in with her 'cause she's a handful [laughter] 

378.48 382.60 A: oh yeah [laughter] there you go yeah 

382.26 392.46 B: but there are people who have them kinda businesses out of their home just [sigh] take a couple of the rooms and redo 'em and set up like a little daycare in the house 

384.71 387.04 A: (( hm mhm yeah [noise] )) 

389.87 390.95 A: redo it up 

391.97 393.80 A: yeah exactly 

393.82 396.72 B: but that's always good then you don't have to leave the house and yeah 

396.04 405.81 A: well yeah you can still i like that 'cause you still are getting some of your things done around the house to a degree too i mean you can still prepare supper or do a little bit of cleaning or laundry while you're doing that stuff 

405.87 410.55 A: (( and you're not yeah you're not out away from the home and you can get that done so that's a benefit )) 

414.54 417.81 B: thems the only ones i could think about that i would probably do 

416.54 417.58 A: (( to that i suppose )) 

417.75 418.96 A: (( but hm yeah i know me too )) 

420.89 423.81 B: (( course i don't know if they'd be moneymakers or not )) 

423.57 425.43 A: i know that's the thing 

425.66 430.58 A: eh yeah what would be ben- what would be the most moneymaking bene- venture 

430.90 431.67 A: hm 

433.94 435.01 A: (( [noise] interesting )) 

435.15 437.36 B: (( that's a long ten minutes ain't it )) 

436.39 441.78 A: i know i was gonna say that was just like hey is it ten minutes soon i should have looked at my [laughter] clock 

441.96 447.15 B: [laughter] i thought my phone registered how many minutes you was on here but i guess this one don't must be the other one 

446.08 447.22 A: oh 

447.33 448.39 A: right 

449.12 449.88 A: hm 

450.81 451.98 B: (( [mn] [sigh] )) 

452.07 455.32 B: but i don't know any other kind of businesses i'd be interested in 

455.38 463.88 A: yeah yeah what was there was three questions what home business or what business would you do would you be successful and what was the other question there was three i thought 

455.52 456.29 B: (( for the )) 

464.15 467.28 B: there was but i i don't remember what that was 

465.35 467.42 A: i don't remember the other one i remember 

471.01 472.04 A: (( hm oh well )) 

473.23 476.55 A: brainstorm some more and try and think of things i suppose eh 

476.58 478.28 B: [laughter] 

477.29 481.24 A: [laughter] oh dear so you've never done one of these either though 

481.21 483.94 B: no i just signed up for it yesterday 

481.87 482.72 A: no 

483.49 486.42 A: oh okay yeah 

486.82 495.02 A: so after it's done do we have to do anything else in order to know that they we finished it or what i wonder 'cause i had some p._i._n. number given to me in one email 

494.92 496.67 B: [mn] [sigh] yeah i thought it said 

496.69 502.95 B: you would hear a a beep or something after the ten minutes it gives you time to say goodbye or whatever 

499.07 500.07 A: oh 

502.59 504.22 A: right hm i'll 

504.82 506.82 A: (( be interested in how that works )) 

505.94 510.57 B: and course maybe this is a good thing to get a business going one of these research things 

509.04 509.90 A: yeah 

510.44 513.38 A: yeah research stuff yeah that's true 

510.86 512.64 B: [laughter] 

512.68 516.45 B: 'cause i don't know who funds that type of stuff who pays for that but [laughter] 

516.08 518.58 A: yeah how you would get that yeah hm 

522.13 523.30 B: (( [sigh] well )) 

524.07 525.34 A: (( thinking what else is )) 

524.58 526.12 B: i could always um 

527.68 528.68 B: (( well no )) 

529.67 532.54 B: no i don't really know anything else i'd be interested in 

532.27 537.12 A: (( yeah i was thinking too i don't know if i would besides those three things )) 

538.20 543.95 A: 'cause it has to i mean if you're gonna do your own business it's gotta be something that you enjoy doing and like to do 

544.19 557.05 A: as well i mean that's the purpose if you're gonna do a business that you are starting yourself it's gotta be something you enjoy or like to do otherwise it's not gonna last very long if you don't even enjoy doing it why start up a business then i suppose so 

557.07 557.63 A: (( hm )) 

558.24 559.18 B: (( yeah )) 

562.07 566.36 B: course i don't know retail for fifteen years i was glad when i quit [laughter]

568.91 570.29 A: [laughter] 

569.68 571.34 B: that can be rough 

570.93 574.11 A: yeah were you up in the management level as well then 

574.30 575.28 B: uh 

575.41 578.10 B: uh well i was like a department head
