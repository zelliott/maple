22.96 25.31 B: would you why would you open a bakery [noise] 

24.85 36.86 A: i love to bake i love to cook but cooking there would be too much involved too many dishes i think and um i do a little bit better at baking i just love to bake [laughter] 

36.24 37.20 B: uh-huh 

37.11 38.75 A: what about yourself 

38.17 50.88 B: well i love baking as well i love baking cakes and cookies and brownies because i have a family and um it requires uh just a little bit of work on certain things but when you get to really like the uh 

43.38 44.49 A: (( [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

51.01 63.70 B: birthday cakes and things like that i prefer the bakery itself but at the same time i love to bake bake uh baked goods like brownies and uh matter of fact yesterday uh we baked cookies with my daughter 

53.22 54.15 A: mhm 

63.31 67.32 A: [noise] oh um it was m- oh happy mother's day as a matter of fact 

66.87 69.13 B: thank you same to you 

67.50 76.68 A: [noise] um [noise] i i made a lemon meringue pie from scratch i have a scratch recipe that actually came out of the ann landers column 

76.11 77.10 B: uh-huh 

76.89 83.51 A: [noise] so it's instead of the regular uh like a lemon pudding recipe where you would just have to fill the pie shell 

83.29 84.53 B: oh okay 

83.90 91.03 A: [noise] i did it from scratch and [noise] did the meringue do you know what i'm not good with baking though i'm 

85.40 87.32 B: right i bet that's good 

90.89 99.92 A: haven't experimented much with breads [noise] because i'm afraid of yeast [laughter] [noise] yeah do you do breads [noise] pardon me 

93.65 94.64 B: mhm 

96.22 97.44 B: oh really 

97.74 99.28 B: of overdoing it 

99.52 100.85 B: overdoing it 

100.19 105.58 A: [noise] i just don't know qu- i just cannot get a handle on the temperature 

105.32 106.57 B: oh i see 

105.85 108.96 A: [noise] i have a really good recipe for easter bread [noise] 

108.53 109.52 B: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

108.74 117.37 A: that um i had gotten from my mom my mom used to make it all the time [noise] and it's a very sweet very chewy it's a it's a 

117.17 123.77 A: special kind of bread and i can't find it anywhere to buy it [noise] and i've tried it twice on my own and 

120.65 121.51 B: uh-huh 

123.77 132.64 A: both times it didn't come out very well because i i know it was because of the yeast i just didn't the it must not have been the right temperature 

132.26 141.28 B: well you know um i think baking as in with anything just takes a little bit of practice and a little bit of time and the more you do it the better it gets 

138.46 140.03 A: (( [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

140.69 142.00 A: mhm 

141.38 147.83 B: because um i had a aunt that could really bake some of the best dinner rolls that you would ever wanna taste 

147.18 149.07 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

148.17 151.03 B: and she knew how to work with the yeast 

150.13 151.88 A: (( [noise] right )) 

151.27 159.87 B: so i understand where you're coming from and i have never been able to do that and i wish i had just took a little bit more time to learn even though i was a kid at the time 

159.49 160.76 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

160.24 163.40 B: but she made it look so easy 

163.10 167.40 A: [lipsmack] [noise] i think that because i am afraid of it or i i 

167.37 176.07 A: especially like this easter bread recipe it had [noise] a lot of ingredients so you waste a lot when it doesn't come out good because it actually makes ten loaves so you can 

169.39 170.38 B: mhm 

176.02 186.78 A: tell how much ingredients goes into it [noise] um because i don't do well with it i don't practice a lot because i'm af- always afraid i'm gonna fail with it but 

178.96 179.98 B: uh-huh 

186.14 193.46 B: well that's probably you know failing is not bad because that's how we learn and i used to feel the same way 

192.97 194.62 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

193.53 205.23 B: so the way i look at it now um there have been some things that i've failed terribly at and i used to feel really bad about it myself but it was a learning experience so instead of taking it as a waste 

205.11 206.90 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

205.13 210.70 B: or you know a failure it's more so a stepping stone to help you get to where you're trying to go 

210.33 214.45 A: [noise] mhm what is your um favorite cookie or cake 

214.19 215.50 B: brownies 

214.91 217.12 A: [noise] oh brownies you like brownies [sigh] 

216.33 218.86 B: i love brownies with ice cream 

218.36 219.33 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

219.32 224.56 B: and um matter of fact yesterday we we baked cookies and um 

219.39 219.97 A: (( [sigh] )) 

224.56 232.28 B: i used to burn up cookies believe it or not i could not get the timing right and when you put cookies in to bake 

226.05 227.57 A: [noise] really 

228.98 230.24 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

231.81 233.20 A: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

232.28 246.82 B: okay you're supposed to leave 'em in for a certain length of time i would take 'em out too soon and i'm like gosh you know okay now this isn't gonna taste good then i leave 'em in too long then i like yesterday i smelled them like oh god we're burning cookies but you know the more i did it the better it got 

234.96 235.81 A: uh-huh 

242.60 243.83 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

246.38 255.50 A: [sigh] [noise] right and i think on that the key is like a cookie sheet you need a good cookie sheet [noise] um i when i was younger and started out baking and things like that 

250.74 252.44 B: mhm mhm 

255.41 264.85 A: i would have cheaper cookie sheets so they would either [noise] you know how you're they're in there and then you hear that noise 'cause they buckled on one end or something [noise] or or they stick 

257.74 258.88 B: mhm 

261.63 263.89 B: oh yeah mhm mhm 

264.63 275.73 A: i finally invested in some really good heavy duty cookie sheets [noise] so that makes a difference now i think brownies tend to be a little touchy too because [sigh] 

268.15 270.02 B: oh yes mhm 

275.82 277.84 A: mm i know if you 

276.55 278.67 B: they get too hard around the crust 

278.25 283.12 A: [noise] i do like the ha- the i love the edge but um 

283.44 296.09 A: i even with those don't quite know when to take 'em out because sometimes they look or feel like they may not be done [noise] but yet if you leave 'em just a little bit too long then they get really hard 

290.64 291.57 B: right 

295.02 299.35 B: right now i've learned from that i used to get mine where they weren't 

299.42 309.62 B: really done and i'm thinking okay well it should be because of the edges so what i started doing i would actually sit it on a cookie sheet even though it was in a brownie pan 

299.77 301.86 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

309.17 310.81 A: [noise] oh okay [noise] 

310.34 314.21 B: and but it took so long though to figure it out even though i've 

313.14 315.77 A: and what does setting it on the cookie sheet do 

315.45 329.81 B: well it seems to me that it kinda evens it out for me um as far as like the temperature because um i baked some last week and the edges were really really kinda just rough so what i also do 

319.28 320.23 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

321.58 322.59 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

327.34 329.01 A: (( [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

329.83 332.16 B: if it says leave it in for thirty minutes 

331.54 332.41 A: (( mhm )) 

332.27 335.33 B: well when it's like down to twenty minutes 

334.42 335.74 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

335.36 346.65 B: i begin to say okay now i'm gonna just stand here and just see how where we are i check it with a a knife and some uh sometimes we bake brownies with the little chewy um chocolate chunks in it 

339.68 341.31 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

345.95 346.97 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

346.94 354.20 B: and i will make sure that i would get past that but i always check the edges to see if it's sticking around the edges itself okay 

353.94 355.41 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

354.15 364.58 B: and then if it's not sticking and you can see where it's pulled away and it's beginning to get a little bit hard if you check it with a knife then you know to take it out 'cause some brownies you can't leave in for the fu- uh full thirty minutes 

364.18 375.23 A: [noise] right well i do the same with cookies like if it says eight to ten minutes i [noise] check it on the lighter side [noise] i al- i i would tend to under bake the cookies [noise] as opposed to over bake them [noise] 

368.09 368.98 B: right 

369.80 370.82 B: right 

373.14 374.21 B: mhm 

374.59 375.69 B: mhm 

375.12 388.55 A: um because i do like 'em to be nice and soft and chewy [noise] like my um christmas cut out cookie recipe is uh made with sour cream [noise] and so they're real moist and i tend to just 

378.53 379.53 B: right 

384.05 385.36 B: oh 

388.48 394.92 A: when they're even looking just the the slightest bit brown on the bottom [noise] you know take 'em out [noise] 

392.62 393.70 B: mhm 

394.51 405.06 B: but you know what i think a a business like that would really go over great because um i have some cookies well had some cookies from mrs steele 

405.11 411.90 B: and the only cookies that i ever really had at one point were just the regular old cookies you get at the store and i'm thinking like okay 

411.87 421.21 B: what's the deal she's just like everybody else well my husband bought me this beautiful gift basket of mrs steele's cookies on one of his trips he was on last year 

414.10 415.31 A: mhm 

421.22 422.50 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

421.47 429.45 B: and i was just ecstatic i did not know they had such a wonderful variety so it's almost like a well kept secret 

428.98 430.66 A: (( [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

429.63 433.62 B: and i think the more people that get into baking 

433.90 446.22 B: that actually cook from scratch and cook originally you know like what you don't just say package it up and off you go but cook more like from scratch i think that's a wonderful idea to get into 

437.70 438.80 A: right 

440.57 442.36 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

444.56 456.42 A: [noise] mhm [noise] right and they it tastes a lot better like in addition to the lemon pie i have a really good um coconut cream pie that my sister in law gave me that you make from scratch 

455.90 456.89 B: uh-huh 

456.39 470.61 A: [noise] the good good thing about that is the crust part [noise] is just a coconut type crust like you don't need a regular crust the crust part is actually you melt butter in the pan you put coconut in it just to brown it a little bit [noise] and then 

460.74 461.66 B: mhm 

469.35 470.37 B: mhm 

470.56 479.61 A: you press that into the sides and the bottom of the dish bake it for a couple of minutes and take it out and that's your actual crust for the coconut cream pie so 

479.74 487.27 A: like you said was a lot of um different types of variations [noise] and things that you can't get every day [noise] um 

483.43 484.86 B: oh yeah yeah 

485.60 486.71 B: right 

487.33 490.77 A: i think people will always want baked goods [laughter] [noise] 

490.55 497.92 B: well i think it'll go over really great i really do and i think it'd be very successful especially you know like if you start off small 

492.52 493.80 A: mhm 

497.02 498.65 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

498.29 500.25 B: work your way into it 

500.42 508.34 B: see what type of um clientele you'll have you can even start off with sample cookies and sample baked goods to see what 

503.22 504.91 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

507.06 512.04 A: [noise] mhm [noise] i think samples are real important in any no matter what business you would decide to do 

511.73 512.77 B: oh yes 

512.10 517.52 A: [noise] i think if people are given samples you know that helps them make a decision 

517.05 529.13 B: oh yeah it definitely does it it helps so many ways because that way that's like okay where did i get this where did i taste this i've never tasted anything like that this tastes fresh this tastes wonderful this is something that i would wanna buy 

528.97 537.37 B: and and people once they find out it's like a little bakery that we have out here and uh they make everything from scratch it's a german bakery 

532.71 534.34 A: (( [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

537.03 539.17 A: oh i bet it's good 

538.54 544.65 B: and everything tastes so different from what i'm accustomed to [noise] with the chocolate and everything 

544.17 545.42 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

544.66 552.84 B: you would be amazed at the the goods and how great it tastes and the chocolate because it's different from what you would ordinarily taste 

552.31 555.00 A: [noise] right choc- [noise] chocolate's a favorite [noise] 

553.11 557.11 B: so you start off small yeah i mean they just have one shop here 

556.91 558.53 A: mhm 

557.88 563.00 B: so if you look at it like that not even investing to go over here and 

561.67 563.54 A: [noise] right and [noise] mhm 

563.07 566.41 B: you could start off and see how could you work from home 

566.52 572.57 A: [noise] i would love that that would be the plus on having my own business would be able to work from home 

572.41 577.51 B: well you may wanna check into it as far as zoning 'cause that's what i was i'm into 

572.60 573.16 A: (( [noise] )) 

577.20 578.33 A: mhm 

577.52 582.62 B: uh to see if my area can be zoned for where i can um work from home and it is 

582.18 583.36 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

582.66 587.67 B: and there are certain specifications that the courthouse um ask that i do 

587.23 591.47 A: [noise] right as far as like for health reasons and things [noise] mhm [noise] 

589.74 599.96 B: yes so you basically find out what they would require for a su- uh you know the the permits and so forth and you may be at a point where you could 

597.30 598.46 A: mhm
