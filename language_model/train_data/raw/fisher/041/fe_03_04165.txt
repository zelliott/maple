0.30 2.06 A: uh my name is mike 

1.75 3.32 B: hi i'm john 

3.37 4.35 A: hi 

4.40 5.31 B: how're you 

5.04 9.16 A: not bad uh this is my first time is this your first time 

8.15 10.04 B: yeah this is my first 

9.61 14.08 A: right um well i guess uh do you wanna start 

14.16 18.53 B: um sure i mean if i could open a business i'd probably 

18.98 24.77 B: um i would probably do something like internet related uh 

24.15 25.17 A: okay 

25.33 40.06 B: i'm not entirely sure what but um i know that you know in order to establish a web presence you have to like get you know a whole bunch of servers and um have them on the internet and um so you know whatever 

34.76 36.33 A: right 

39.20 45.83 A: which would require like quite a bit of money and as they say money's being no object then you could do that right 

43.38 44.40 B: right 

44.66 47.04 B: well but the other thing is that um 

47.07 53.46 B: they u- they do have you know larger companies which you know basically lease servers to you because 

53.49 57.34 B: you know trying to put your own on the internet would be you know 

57.56 64.09 B: very difficult because you'd have to find like you know very stable network and things like that and those can be costly so 

63.28 64.68 A: (( [mn] right )) 

64.11 74.86 B: i mean i know money's not an object but ev- if it even if it were you you could actually save by not doing it all on your own you could just go and you know um 

71.67 78.00 A: right it's like subletting so to speak from yeah right uh 

75.13 76.61 B: yeah exactly 

76.95 82.43 B: exactly leasing some server and network you know from from a larger company and then 

80.23 82.34 A: (( right )) 

83.20 86.45 B: and then you know establishing your presence that way 

86.02 94.51 A: right well my my uh what i would do would be to open an liquor store [laughter] a liquor store 

92.26 93.94 B: so a liquor store oh yeah 

94.11 96.07 B: well i'd come visit [laughter] okay 

95.10 103.18 A: [laughter] well i no longer drink but uh i remember wh- when i was a little boy um 

103.27 107.33 A: that um that's what i wanted to do i wanted to open a liquor store 

106.81 107.95 B: (( uh-huh right right )) 

107.34 108.80 A: and because i 

109.31 122.57 A: it it looked to me like uh he would uh he was making money and he was uh uh had a nice car and everything and uh its it's and we we weren't we were rather poor at that time so 

121.99 123.06 B: right 

122.78 134.63 A: uh but you know in order to do that i'd i'd have to get a liquor license uh i'd have to get uh uh uh buy the stock i'd have to buy uh the um 

134.74 147.75 A: uh i'd have to have employees uh i'd have to location location location uh and uh advertising budget um and uh a business plan 

140.53 141.67 B: (( right right )) 

147.96 151.52 A: that's what you'd need too right and uh 

149.27 150.17 B: right 

151.56 155.23 A: uh then um uh backers uh 

155.62 159.02 A: uh possibly um and um 

159.64 173.49 A: so i mean [sigh] i think everybody you know especially when you get you know that spam you that they make it sound like it's so easy to to open up a businesses but it but in reality i think you 

170.32 171.08 B: right 

173.48 178.49 A: you're more realistic you know the because this it can be quite 

179.24 180.70 A: complicated 

180.23 193.62 B: right yeah i mean definitely like i mean i was thinking you know kind of avoiding the brick and mortar story you know just because that in itself um like you said location matters but also 

188.37 189.56 A: right 

192.92 194.21 A: right 

193.79 198.32 B: the physical space you have to rent and then all the utilities that go with it you know 

197.79 200.48 A: truly yeah 

199.12 205.45 B: so but i mean it's not a bad idea i mean i'm i'm sure you know liquor stores will never run out of business right 

204.62 213.78 A: oh definitely not [laughter] that's for sure [laughter] i think they even had them during the depression so yeah so 

211.79 212.88 B: right 

213.90 217.52 A: but uh you know going with what you were 

217.70 220.44 A: you were talking about a little bit 

219.97 222.64 B: actually well the thing is the main 

222.71 226.03 B: you know i mean this is mostly off the top of my head obviously i'm not 

225.58 228.17 A: sure yeah yeah 

226.15 226.99 B: (( a business )) 

227.48 230.62 B: the one thing i'm trying to figure out was what you know 

230.93 234.56 B: it's kinda funny because i was trying to figure out what i was gonna do 

234.73 239.63 B: like wh- okay fine you wanted some sort of internet based business but what is it you know 

234.76 235.62 A: (( yeah )) 

239.18 240.41 A: right 

239.69 253.46 B: and i was thinking like you know do you try to sell something do you try to provide some sort of service and i was just thinking you know because you had mentioned the liquor store that you know i could sell liquor over the internet [laughter] well i don't know if they actually i don't know if it's legal 

249.57 251.29 A: oh sure yeah 

252.12 266.29 A: well they do that now right well they they're kind of now now they've come to some kind of a situation where young uh kids are are ordering it and uh they're being shipped to 

266.24 274.98 A: to them and um so uh uh they're um kind of um coming down on those kinds of um 

273.70 274.69 B: right 

275.20 276.72 A: of um 

277.15 278.98 A: uh businesses [sigh] 

278.48 289.29 B: right and it probably i mean i said it kinda tongue in cheek i think it's probably mm you know would be difficult because i think it's one of those things where 

289.46 303.56 B: you know people kind of like even me like you know i you know i would never buy liquor over the internet i would just go to a liquor store so it's not one of those things that people think about when they think of oh i'm gonna buy something over the internet you know 

296.74 300.12 A: right true yeah and not only what 

303.56 305.96 A: it's just not one of those things right 

306.04 310.59 A: (( it it isn't on amazon dot com [laughter] but )) 

308.53 309.46 B: right 

310.83 312.18 A: but um 

312.37 318.96 B: it'd be interesting though but it'd be i think it'd be very difficult especially with all these laws and things like that right 

313.51 314.72 A: (( [lipsmack] sure )) 

318.30 320.31 A: sure and um 

320.32 329.39 A: uh especially with drunken driving and so on and so forth and yeah it it could be kind of complicated but um 

322.86 323.67 B: (( right )) 

329.50 331.31 A: i don't know um 

331.35 333.62 A: [lipsmack] i probably 

334.00 341.31 A: and the other thing i'd probably find a location where i'd really enjoy it you know i'd probably find it i uh i live in the northeast so 

341.32 347.10 A: uh i'd probably find a place you know maybe in arizona or uh probably 

347.85 361.56 A: if money's no option what the hell uh honolulu or maui yeah right [laughter] [laughter] i mean if you're gonna dream dream big right [laughter] right 

350.77 352.54 B: yeah exactly [laughter] 

354.20 354.97 B: (( right right )) 

358.47 361.94 B: yeah you definitely wanna be in a urban area too 

361.69 363.91 A: uh right there you go 

362.60 363.79 B: (( and you know well )) 

364.05 367.34 A: (( but uh yeah w- )) 

366.47 371.51 B: you gotta be in a big city honolu- honolulu's better than new york city [laughter] 

368.41 370.36 A: honolulu would do it 

370.72 374.26 A: sure [laughter] right uh 

374.57 376.02 A: and uh 

376.04 378.22 A: let's see i could um [mn] 

379.38 386.18 A: i'm also wondering how did it well they must have liquor distributorships you know there too as well 

386.33 393.20 A: and where is the liquor coming from it's probably coming from japan as well as uh from the u- the u._s. 

392.96 395.77 B: right right i mean you're centrally located so 

395.45 397.76 A: oh definitely right 

397.90 401.03 A: but uh yeah that'd be that'd be 

399.88 405.08 B: and there's constant flights you know across the pacific and stopping in hawaii so 

404.52 407.09 A: right and then uh 

405.71 408.55 B: you're never gonna have to worry about you know 

408.82 413.58 A: and there're quite a few servicemen too and servicemen are noted for drinking so 

408.92 409.87 B: (( right [laughter] right )) 

413.59 415.89 A: they shouldn't have any problem with that 

416.16 417.35 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

417.38 418.88 A: (( but um )) 

418.33 420.12 B: i mean is it something 

420.15 422.05 B: like you know like 

422.06 425.30 B: a store you'd have open twenty four seven or just 

424.71 434.93 A: well it you know the laws with alcohol are you know i mean they've just started i mean on a ver- uh advertising on uh 

434.91 447.07 A: on t._v. you know and it's still very difficult to to uh other than wine and um and beer that's the only thing they've been advertising i think they tried it for a little while and then they stopped you know 

447.14 453.39 A: you know like whiskey and scotch and stuff like that but 

454.33 455.21 A: uh 

455.59 461.61 A: [sigh] then then finding the it's so difficult finding the market in and your niche in it 

461.07 462.54 B: (( right right )) 

461.86 463.72 A: you know so 

463.85 473.25 A: um i think in you were talking about okay um they have uh things like wine dot com 

472.57 473.56 B: right 

473.56 479.24 A: and what they have is not only uh the various kinds of wine 

479.26 486.91 A: but they also have uh the um uh information on them and the you know 

486.94 490.37 A: how to uh smelling the bouquet 

488.86 491.14 B: right kinda like a guide to 

490.67 499.30 A: guide right and uh if you're a novice and you know loads of information on that and uh 

497.13 498.18 B: right 

499.56 509.84 A: but that's a niche market so i mean in all likelihood you know a kid is not gonna order any anything like that he wants you know 

501.51 502.49 B: right 

507.12 507.83 B: (( yeah right )) 

510.01 514.03 A: hundred proof or a hundred and fifty one proof or something like that 

514.38 515.63 A: but 

514.43 527.53 B: yeah that's probably the yeah i think you you hit it on the head i mean with these internet based services you really have to carve out a sort of something that makes you different from uh any- anything else because 

528.20 542.58 B: i mean like a liquor store's different because you know p- you know it doesn't matter wh- in some ways it doesn't matter where you are although certain places are definitely better than others but you know there's gonna be people who drink and there're people who are gonna wanna you know stop by the liquor store pick up you know 

534.88 537.35 A: sure right 

542.67 548.50 B: whatever it is that they can't get in like the supermarket and all that and so you know with that 

542.96 544.22 A: right 

544.75 546.93 A: (( yeah )) 

548.61 556.05 B: um yeah if you found something that you'd be great but you don't even really need one because it's its own kind of you know self sustaining 

555.99 558.59 A: right right 

556.64 559.96 B: area wi- with the internet it's a little bit dif- 

558.93 560.60 A: it's it's it's alm- 

560.65 570.20 A: yeah i would think that that would be your best way to go i mean i don't think i i would i wouldn't like the idea of of um 

564.36 565.11 B: yeah 

570.16 583.38 A: a liquor store in the inner city because number you know number one it's you know it just seems to me like it's it just isn't right you know and number two that it's very dangerous 

573.41 574.09 B: (( right )) 

578.97 579.96 B: right 

583.69 586.37 A: you know they it's you know there's some 

586.38 599.95 A: there's some place you know in the inner city where you know there's like ten liquor stores and you know with daggers with [laughter] with loads of loads of beer and all of this and cigarettes and you know and that's 

596.63 597.63 B: right
