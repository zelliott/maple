309.49 315.37 B: would you want to have it in conjunction with a website if you ever got to expand maybe you could have 

314.61 317.53 A: yeah that'd be a good idea do that just to get it out everywhere 

317.22 318.41 B: yeah 

317.79 319.19 A: the website and the 

319.60 324.22 A: and like all these other stores doing buy it from the store if you're too embarrassed do it off the website and

371.42 372.58 A: those are interesting 

373.78 375.28 A: um [sigh] 

376.20 384.09 A: so yeah i guess i if i had an adult website though i guess i would do yeah just the co- the website and the store do a chain of stores on the website that'd be kinda cool 

383.48 386.38 B: would you wanna go national or [laughter] just uh 

386.93 390.17 B: uh keep within texas or your town or what 

390.71 391.99 A: i'd go national 

393.14 396.67 B: i might be the first i don't know if there about any other uh 

396.21 397.33 A: [laughter] 

396.73 398.27 B: i'm not too uh 

399.12 401.16 B: experienced in the whole uh 

401.22 405.52 B: adult kind of [laughter] stores but uh i don't know if there's a national chain 

405.82 407.04 A: (( i don't either )) 

406.50 411.08 B: maybe you could be like the wal-mart of like [laughter] adult entertainment and stuff like that 

409.17 411.39 A: right [laughter] 

411.20 413.38 B: or whatever yeah huh 

412.75 414.41 A: have one in every small town 

414.78 416.04 B: (( ooh )) 

416.06 417.16 A: [laughter] 

419.65 425.17 B: [sigh] huh so yeah all right um 

426.14 428.42 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] what business 

428.44 435.85 B: [lipsmack] how would you set it up well the thing that the fact that money's not a factor that kind of uh makes it a little bit too easy 

435.95 437.44 A: yeah it does 

436.82 439.31 B: like oh okay you know someone's just gonna give me this 

438.42 444.21 A: i mean 'cause i guess if money really wasn't a factor honestly i'd probably do i don't know if it's a business or like a non-profit organization 

444.09 445.12 B: (( oh okay )) 

444.87 450.78 A: and that would probably be an investment like i would probably enjoy that more than an adult that just was the first thing that came to my mind just being stupid 

450.83 451.94 A: (( but um )) 

452.33 457.79 A: 'cause like my dad was an alcoholic and i would i think a lot of the problem was that people didn't listen to him you 

457.40 458.54 B: (( mhm )) 

457.96 466.13 A: know as far as medical doctors and psychiatrists and all that just didn't no one would listen 'cause not even the doctors it's like they're they're quantity instead of quality 

465.82 466.69 B: okay 

466.35 470.58 A: they're trying to you know push people through so fast that that um 

470.90 474.63 A: they don't think anybody really listens they're just here to take the do the you know 

473.92 474.65 B: (( mhm ooh )) 

474.80 486.44 A: and um i had a friend of mine's dad that actually was an alcoholic also and he died from mixed drug and alcohol drugs were prescribed to him but you weren't supposed to drink with alcohol and he's an alcoholic and they prescribed them 

484.20 486.28 B: and they didn't know about that 

486.65 491.57 A: oh they knew he was an alcoholic and they subscribed these to him and just said don't take alcohol with them well [laughter] 

491.68 492.64 A: (( hello )) 

492.42 493.42 B: yeah 

492.79 497.62 A: you know and it's just part of the whole thing of not listening that's all he needs he needs somebody just to listen to him 

497.26 498.20 B: uh-huh 

497.68 506.89 A: and i think maybe that's what i would do like up in the hill country somewhere or something open up maybe like a non-profit organization like a camp you know where people can just come and stay and have a nice setting and you know real laid back 

505.37 507.35 B: (( kind of like a retreat or something )) 

507.24 520.07 A: yeah just to you know they can go at their own pace no one's there to pressure them to say you have to go through this many steps or this step program or whatever just somebody to sit there and there's people there to listen to 'em even volunteers just regular people you know they don't necessarily have to be a doctor 

513.99 514.88 B: uh-huh 

519.93 520.82 B: (( mhm )) 

520.21 527.65 A: or you know offer have licensed people on hand that can volunteer that would pay enough money you know be willing to pay those people but 

527.70 535.83 A: just to maybe do that like in a nice country setting you know next to the river and they can swim horseback riding you know all kinds of activities like that just to do to 

536.32 538.02 A: (( ease their mind you know what i mean )) 

537.55 539.07 B: mhm yeah 

538.48 540.36 A: (( i don't know maybe that would work )) 

539.23 541.92 B: it sounds like a a good thing for society 

541.85 546.41 A: yeah there's not really anything out there either because we tried to look into that for my dad one 

546.63 548.72 A: there's not really much of that out there 

548.52 550.04 B: mhm 

549.54 554.03 A: and the ones that they are they are like outrageously priced so i think if money wasn't 

552.27 556.06 B: yeah yeah it's kinda like for uh hollywood stars and stuff like that right 

555.17 566.80 A: yeah yeah so i think maybe if money wasn't a problem do it at either you know a low cost or maybe even get companies to sponsor people the companies they can do write offs you know like coke or pepsi or 

563.32 564.21 B: uh-huh 

566.89 570.15 A: any of these companies they can do tax write offs to donate money 

569.81 571.50 B: (( yeah )) 

570.56 573.06 A: to do that you know for to help people 

572.97 574.38 B: (( yeah that'd be a good thing )) 

573.73 574.98 A: that might be cool 

576.09 583.83 B: see a non-profit sounds pretty good kind of opposite ends to the spectrum of adult [laughter] uh porno shop 

581.91 583.69 A: (( [laughter] right yeah )) 

584.22 585.85 B: whatever floats your boat 

586.62 587.44 B: [cough] 

589.88 592.18 A: and then you you can donate tickets 

592.35 593.57 A: to these people 

593.22 594.34 B: yeah 

593.74 596.16 A: one weekend they can go out and see their game and 

595.42 596.47 B: exactly 

596.41 597.65 A: meet you and 

596.91 598.28 B: have a good time 

597.72 599.88 A: all the players and see that worked 

599.45 599.89 B: (( mhm ))
