14.58 26.74 B: [lipsmack] well i don't know actually i'm not very interested in owning my own business but just today a good friend of mine said why don't you 

26.91 39.51 B: um open a coffee shop so that i can run it because she wants to run a coffee shop but she's not an american citizen so she can't have a visa to you know just open up her own place and run it 

32.27 33.08 A: (( mm )) 

34.40 35.22 A: (( uh-huh )) 

39.46 40.37 A: uh-huh 

40.16 47.78 B: so i guess i would open up a coffee shop for my friend [laughter] 'cause i don't know what i would want to do what about you 

43.93 45.52 A: hm okay 

47.94 56.91 A: hm [lipsmack] um well they said that the money is not the issue so that changes a lot i think because [laughter] you know 

54.40 55.71 B: that's true 

56.83 63.42 A: this way i can do something that i that would be truly interesting to me like 

63.52 68.93 A: hobby maybe or like i'm very much into sports so maybe 

68.25 69.87 B: oh cool [noise] oh 

68.96 71.99 A: open like a gym or um 

72.32 74.36 A: a place where people could 

74.39 81.84 A: play games you know like a really big gym with a basketball court and you know like a field [laughter] so 

82.20 83.45 B: oh 

82.23 86.29 A: that would be something i would really wanna do and um 

86.89 91.18 A: i guess kind of like a y._m._c._a. style saying where 

90.17 91.33 B: (( cool )) 

91.42 96.00 A: when people maybe wouldn't have to pay to to go there so 

95.43 97.09 B: that would be awesome 

96.87 103.28 A: yeah but i don't know if that's a business at all [laughter] or more like a a charitable organization 

100.35 102.01 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

103.44 107.86 B: that's true 'cause they asked would we be successful business people 

103.49 104.44 A: so 

107.82 109.38 A: yeah 

109.02 117.08 B: so i mean i don't know if that means we're supposed to be non profit or if we can define success however we want [laughter] 

109.50 110.27 A: (( oh )) 

116.24 117.84 A: (( oh yeah )) 

118.09 124.92 A: um did you know that i personally think i would not be a good business woman 

118.27 119.35 B: (( [sigh] )) 

124.63 125.61 B: uh-huh 

125.11 126.41 A: (( because uh )) 

126.63 127.94 A: (( i )) 

128.61 139.27 A: like my emotions and my um feelings would get int- in in the way and very often in business you have to be kind of cold and very like 

133.65 135.10 B: me too 

139.55 143.83 A: um just using your brain not your feelings [laughter] 

142.86 147.35 B: yeah i think i would want to give everything away 

147.26 148.45 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

147.58 160.42 B: to the people who couldn't afford it or to the people who i liked or to strangers who i thought would like a nice surprise you know or like i think i would wanna be giving everything [laughter] away all the time 

152.95 153.90 A: mhm 

157.20 158.19 A: mhm 

159.52 162.16 A: yeah yeah mhm 

161.60 166.13 B: i don't know if [sigh] i mean i don't think you'll earn very much that [laughter] way 

166.08 167.70 A: (( yeah [laughter] mm )) 

167.06 175.74 B: but i don't know i mean actually i hadn't thought of it before but your idea makes me think it would be fun to have like a yoga studio 

175.80 177.31 B: i really like yoga 

177.57 178.59 A: (( oh really )) 

177.72 188.92 B: so i would like a place where but it's the same thing you say i would like a place where i could make it [mn] you know very inexpensive for people to do because 

188.89 193.03 B: that's the only bad thing is that yoga's so kind of expensive [sigh] 

189.15 190.08 A: mhm 

192.42 194.05 A: yeah yeah 

193.17 199.25 B: a lot of the time to do which doesn't really go along with most of what it's based upon [laughter] but 

198.75 199.72 A: yeah 

199.60 200.67 B: so 

200.44 201.67 A: (( yeah )) 

201.37 202.15 B: hm 

202.09 206.20 A: yeah i actually never thought about opening my own business because 

206.23 216.79 A: i'm pretty far from the business world i i g- i just got a teaching degree and so [laughter] i'm not i don't have a business mindset at all [laughter] [mn] 

211.29 212.77 B: oh 

215.95 224.56 B: yeah that's me too that's what i'm studying so we're probably all in the same boat since it's a university study [laughter] it's probably a bunch of 

222.38 223.71 A: (( oh really )) 

224.61 226.32 B: [sigh] future 

225.49 226.26 A: what 

226.48 228.76 B: teachers and professors [laughter] 

226.49 227.98 A: (( what are you studying )) 

228.72 229.64 A: [laughter] 

230.03 231.77 A: what is your major 

231.92 235.36 B: it's um how to teach english as a second language 

235.33 239.96 A: oh yeah that's mine too [laughter] i just graduated 

237.27 239.41 B: (( really where are you oh i didn't )) 

239.73 241.96 B: oh cool wow 

240.99 248.63 A: so yeah i actually we could probably open like a private school um that would be a business too 

248.36 249.98 B: [lipsmack] that's true 

248.96 251.21 A: with our degrees so 

250.97 257.46 B: that's true because there are already like um what's it called berlitz there's like berlitz 

257.77 262.54 B: where you teach language but you have to use their method 

257.94 258.65 A: (( mm )) 

263.01 274.08 B: or they have test preparation too i mean basically there are so many schools in other countries that like prepare you for the toefl test and the speak test 

263.16 264.23 A: (( oh really )) 

269.26 270.23 A: mhm 

272.20 273.19 A: mhm 

273.93 275.07 A: yeah 

275.40 286.56 A: yeah i think this kind of business would be very good in a big city with a lot of immigrants coming in all the time so um and that could be 

281.57 282.85 B: yeah 

286.76 288.24 A: (( profitable i guess )) 

288.35 297.84 B: yeah it would be i mean if we could go anywhere in the world too then i think it would be really profitable in like china 

289.37 290.44 A: (( but i don't )) 

294.78 295.83 A: (( yeah that's true )) 

297.79 298.75 A: mhm 

297.98 303.60 B: or japan where the emphasis is so high on tests 

303.53 304.46 A: (( mhm mm )) 

303.98 311.72 B: and how like you can't really do anything without passing the tests you know like here you can fail a lotta tests but get good grades 

311.80 312.79 A: mhm 

311.94 314.56 B: and still be accepted but 

314.41 315.71 A: yeah 

315.11 318.36 B: [sigh] i mean that's not really a part of the system i think 

318.23 319.56 A: mhm 

318.97 325.73 B: there and i have friends who talk about the private schools already there in china where instructors 

325.78 329.37 B: that just teach you how to pass the toefl earn 

329.70 335.15 B: like i don't know five to ten times the average teacher's salary 

335.25 336.41 A: mhm 

335.84 337.62 B: of china like 

337.67 338.57 A: mhm 

338.09 342.68 B: [sigh] [noise] i mean that's that's pretty phew that's a big difference you know 

338.89 339.83 A: (( wow )) 

342.20 346.92 A: yeah would you go to teach overseas when you get your degree 

342.69 343.47 B: [sigh] 

347.28 353.68 B: i would like to but i think i will probably head towards mexico just to stay close to 

353.96 357.12 B: uh my city and close to 

357.28 363.16 B: you know uh my boyfriend and [laughter] all that stuff yeah i don't know [sigh] 

359.84 361.45 A: mhm mhm 

363.69 364.80 A: (( okay mm mhm )) 

364.41 368.77 B: i don't know about like i mean i thought about europe and asia 

368.99 371.34 B: but i don't really see how to make that 

371.39 372.84 B: work very well 

373.45 377.85 B: without a lot of plane tickets that i won't have the money for [laughter] 

376.98 379.61 A: yeah yeah that's true [noise] 

379.07 382.38 B: yeah what about you will you try to teach overseas somewhere 

382.21 389.96 A: um actually no because i have my green card here and if i leave for over a year i lose it 

385.88 387.64 B: oh that's wonderful 

389.80 390.62 B: uh 

389.85 399.22 A: so even if i wanted to it would be hard without losing my green card so i've i was looking into teaching in a community college 

394.42 395.80 B: yeah 

399.14 400.54 B: yeah 

399.24 400.08 A: uh 

400.14 405.19 A: but it seems like there are a lot of applicants for those positions 

405.49 407.09 A: so i don't know 

407.32 409.23 A: [laughter] but we should have uh 

407.67 409.11 B: i think it's 

409.65 413.73 B: i think it's still good i think you c- it's still worth a shot 

413.78 415.59 B: especially with a degree 

414.04 415.15 A: yeah 

415.71 416.37 A: yeah 

415.75 421.39 B: so many people are teaching and they don't even have degrees in either pedagogy or english so 

421.13 422.31 A: mhm 

422.05 426.37 B: i think our chances are better with certificates and stuff [laughter] [sigh] 

425.72 427.12 A: yeah 

426.71 428.56 B: is that like a business 

428.99 433.77 A: (( um yeah i was just gonna say we should get back to the subject )) 

432.16 434.91 B: [laughter] [sigh] [sigh] exactly [laughter] 

433.89 436.76 A: um no [laughter] 

436.23 438.49 B: yeah probably not huh 

437.55 438.35 A: (( no )) 

438.44 442.36 A: uh but what do you think makes a good businessman 

443.06 444.50 A: or business person 

443.16 448.09 B: [lipsmack] i think you're right i think a good business person has to like 

448.26 454.23 B: use their head a lot and sometimes i mean you should still pay attention to intuition 

454.24 460.00 B: you should still treat people with respect and i think a good business person will do that 

456.92 457.58 A: (( mm )) 

460.02 461.10 A: mhm 

460.49 461.49 B: but 

461.68 465.05 B: i think you have to be kind of hard 

465.11 466.13 A: mhm 

465.28 466.95 B: still i mean 

467.30 467.91 B: [sigh] 

468.20 469.19 A: mhm 

468.84 472.50 B: i i don't know i don't really see it like 

472.95 476.52 B: i mean i'm in teaching because you're allowed to be 

476.73 480.63 B: you know sentimental and admit that you have emotions 

480.50 482.11 A: (( mhm yeah yeah )) 

480.67 487.98 B: and that's even a good thing you know like because you love teaching you love the contact with people you know 

488.00 489.04 A: mhm 

488.28 493.81 B: but like with business i think you're supposed to kind of deny your emotions a little 

493.96 495.75 A: yeah that's true 

494.65 497.31 B: in favor of numbers you know 

497.35 500.42 A: yeah my um uh-huh 

498.16 499.34 B: (( i don't know like )) 

500.65 501.59 B: go ahead 

502.12 507.16 A: my best friend just got a degree an m._b._a. degree and 

506.21 507.26 B: ooh 

507.12 510.31 A: her idea if she had have her way she 

510.20 516.47 A: wanted to open a business she would open a butterfly house i don't know if you know what it is 

516.36 519.95 A: but it's basically like an orchard where there are 

519.57 520.74 B: (( [noise] wow [sigh] )) 

519.74 533.54 A: butterflies just flying around it's spacious enough for them you know and it's got it would have like flowers and exotic plants and and a lot of exotic and not exotic butterflies everywhere 

533.36 542.69 A: so i thought that was a neat idea too although it would be hard to preserve and you know like make sure like that it turns out good for the butterflies 

533.64 534.73 B: (( [sigh] )) 

539.08 540.79 B: (( wow yeah )) 

542.86 548.92 A: so [laughter] but i've never heard it before and when she told me i was like wow that would be interesting 

548.75 554.04 B: that is a really neat idea i mean we have like a hummingbird 

549.03 549.64 A: (( [laughter] )) 

550.79 551.95 A: yeah 

554.13 555.44 B: garden 

555.50 556.68 A: (( mhm )) 

555.99 557.81 B: um at our desert 

558.81 559.60 A: uh-huh 

559.38 573.55 B: and like in there there are a lot of butterflies and a lot of hummingbirds and everything but that you know receives a lot of donations and i think it receives state money too i mean it's definitely not self supporting 

570.52 571.46 A: mhm 

573.66 579.10 B: but it is a part of a whole big network i mean basically if you put a tea room with the butterfly garden 

573.87 574.70 A: yeah 

579.42 580.52 A: mhm 

579.58 582.91 B: [lipsmack] you could really bring in some bucks if you're in a 

583.39 586.09 B: you know that kind of an urban area [sigh] 

584.11 585.06 A: yeah 

586.19 587.78 A: yeah that's true 

588.31 592.86 B: i'd think you know if you can get some you know the ladies to come to tea and 

588.32 589.38 A: mhm 

592.96 597.45 B: spend twenty dollars apiece on some tea and biscuits and [noise] 

596.92 597.86 A: mhm 

598.68 599.89 A: yeah
