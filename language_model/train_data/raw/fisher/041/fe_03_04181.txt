15.41 18.99 B: we're supposed to talk about setting up a business a hypothetical business 

19.31 20.23 A: yes

25.61 28.28 B: would you like to oh would you like to start first 

29.68 32.58 A: okay and what was the question again i'm sorry 

32.22 39.77 B: um well i think we're supposed to talk about what sort of business you would hypothetically set up so 

40.22 42.65 B: what sort of business would you set up 

43.13 45.02 A: oh okay um 

45.98 48.52 A: what type of business would i set up huh [laughter] 

48.05 49.60 B: [laughter] 

48.77 51.58 A: i guess i wasn't really prepared [laughter] for this but um 

50.38 52.20 B: [laughter] 

51.75 54.87 A: okay um i gotta talk for ten minutes right 

54.28 55.12 B: uh-huh 

55.49 57.47 A: okay um 

58.91 61.39 A: and how would i would how would i set it up 

62.14 67.24 B: well i suppose what type and then how one would go about it yeah 

67.40 69.25 A: okay let's go for it 

72.67 73.51 B: pardon 

74.03 75.07 A: the oh 

75.17 77.44 A: so do i go ahead and talk now 

77.33 79.34 B: yeah would you like to or should i 

79.87 82.50 A: oh i didn't know if you tape recorded it or 

82.79 85.09 A: this is the first one i've done here so 

82.94 83.51 B: (( [mn] )) 

84.30 91.52 B: this is actually my first [laughter] one i i think we're just supposed to talk for you know like ten minutes or something a- and then you know 

91.61 93.77 B: have a conversation for ten minutes yeah 

93.20 96.21 A: oh okay i see so i talk with you about this 

95.69 96.52 B: right 

96.45 98.15 A: okay [laughter] 

97.16 98.36 B: [laughter] 

98.17 99.60 A: i guess um 

100.12 103.30 A: i guess the type of business i would set up considering 

103.48 109.12 A: my background would probably be uh an accounting business a tax well a tax service 

109.95 113.37 A: and i guess how i'd go about doing that would be to 

113.69 114.66 A: um 

115.66 117.35 A: first research 

117.48 119.76 A: um any kind of 

120.83 124.04 A: um other businesses in the area and 

123.63 124.49 B: (( oh mhm )) 

124.49 126.43 A: i guess um [lipsmack] 

127.36 132.96 A: [laughter] i would probably get information from maybe small business bureau or 

133.03 133.93 A: (( um )) 

134.07 138.81 A: like the local college for um setting up a business or or 

139.20 141.79 A: putting setting forth a business plan 

141.58 142.27 B: (( mhm mm )) 

142.65 143.90 A: (( and um )) 

145.84 147.84 A: then i would probably 

150.63 151.91 A: (( um )) 

153.69 156.85 A: [lipsmack] i guess i would probably get uh 

159.45 169.25 A: then i would probably just research it a little bit and see what kind of information how much um how much money i would have to put forth in the business um 

169.29 179.62 A: and how much potential earnings how much earnings i'd need to get out of my business to pay for my debt that i accumulated to start the business [laughter] 

179.26 180.91 B: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

180.02 184.54 A: and [laughter] and uh [laughter] 

185.32 188.30 A: and uh let me see 

188.35 196.79 A: [lipsmack] and then of course i'd have to set aside any kind of costs that i would need um like my startup costs like maybe like advertising costs or 

195.55 196.47 B: (( mhm )) 

197.37 200.59 A: um [laughter] my computer 

200.68 205.22 A: or soft- you know whatever software i'd be using for the business 

205.27 206.51 A: um 

207.40 212.68 A: [lipsmack] and then of course any other costs that would incur at that time 

213.22 220.20 A: uh to start it up um like any kind of supplies or office supplies or whatever i would need at the time uh 

220.81 225.07 A: [lipsmack] and since it's a service i probably wouldn't have to pay 

225.73 226.68 A: uh 

228.91 232.47 A: you know i guess certain costs wouldn't be incurred as much as 

232.59 236.50 A: i would if i had a inventory i guess and um 

234.59 235.46 B: (( mhm mhm [noise] )) 

237.22 237.90 A: (( [laughter] )) 

237.98 239.14 A: let me see 

239.18 242.41 A: what else would i do i would probably um 

242.98 246.82 A: though of course um just kind of study the 

248.01 251.26 A: let me see and then what would i do i guess i would try to 

251.53 255.71 A: if i needed one i guess i would try to get a grant which 

256.99 262.03 A: i don't even know if i would be able to get at the moment but i guess i would look into that 

261.42 262.29 B: mhm 

262.62 263.83 A: um 

263.98 264.56 B: (( [laughter] )) 

265.75 268.67 A: [lipsmack] and of course i'd have to set aside the place 

268.71 270.54 A: where my business would be 

271.10 272.13 B: mhm 

271.50 274.01 A: and uh 

276.05 280.47 A: let me see what else [laughter] um 

283.38 286.01 A: let me see what else would i do probably 

288.19 291.63 A: um i guess i'd set up my own 

293.09 294.63 A: company uh 

294.93 296.98 A: oh of course i'd have to get like a 

297.26 302.15 A: tax id- identification number i'd have to retrieve that from the state 

302.40 303.77 A: um 

305.74 307.04 A: and then 

307.83 309.37 A: let me see 

310.26 313.72 A: i would also probably set up like a 

313.76 314.38 A: (( a )) 

314.41 320.01 A: probably like something like quick books or something for my own personal use my own personal 

318.93 320.02 B: (( mhm )) 

320.30 327.24 A: account set up any kind of checking accounts that i would need or a business checking or a 

327.89 329.05 A: (( um )) 

331.42 332.66 A: [lipsmack] i guess 

331.85 333.62 B: (( that that [mn] sorry )) 

333.80 335.09 A: [mn] go ahead [laughter] 

334.40 341.75 B: that i was just saying that's very well planned [laughter] for something hypothetical very well planned for something hypothetical 

337.68 339.08 A: it's very well what 

341.86 345.27 A: yes i don't know what else i had to say [laughter] 

343.80 347.09 B: [laughter] well i probably have to talk too so 

347.13 350.76 B: uh so i think it's probably split between us so 

351.77 352.55 B: so it's 

351.83 352.96 A: so it what 

352.97 357.44 B: [mn] well i i think it's split between us so it's probably like five minutes each 

358.15 361.35 A: oh okay oh i didn't know that i'm sorry 

358.56 362.12 B: yeah so i probably have to talk about 

362.42 365.42 B: my business my hypothetical business now 

365.38 377.84 B: uh so well i i i don't know i i i i i would be rather tempted to uh do one of these ebay things uh where one buys a lot of stuff at wholesale and then ebays it all 

378.00 380.82 B: then i would ha- have to o- obviously um 

381.14 383.65 B: to to do a lot of research on ebay 

383.79 397.15 B: as in what sort of stuff to get and uh what sort of hours the options should start and and uh potential profit margins where i might be able to get the stuff that i want to sell 

397.34 398.83 B: um 

399.21 401.99 B: and then i would have to look into 

402.27 406.39 B: supplies and how i might get them cheaply 

406.66 407.67 B: um 

408.48 411.34 B: i might have to think about uh 

412.02 413.21 B: (( setting up a i )) 

413.58 416.77 B: i mean you know incorporating i think it's called 

417.00 417.98 B: uh 

418.22 419.05 B: and to get 

419.56 421.69 B: possibly to get someone to 

421.79 423.45 B: do the packaging 

423.83 425.94 B: um and such stuff for you know 

426.08 430.62 B: (( um for for for for [mn] an hourly rate )) 

431.12 432.04 B: um 

433.57 438.31 B: i'm not really sure what else one would do but i suppose lots of research on 

438.32 440.41 B: on ebay patterns and 

440.85 444.09 B: read lots of books on what to do 

444.49 446.09 B: in such cases 

448.54 449.10 B: (( um )) 

450.56 452.77 A: that's a good business [laughter] 

451.69 453.09 B: (( uh [laughter] )) 

452.87 455.50 A: (( you could make money doing that actually [laughter] )) 

453.14 454.04 B: well 

455.09 456.84 B: (( oh you've been doing that )) 

456.92 457.92 A: do what 

457.44 459.00 B: you've been doing that 

458.97 460.23 A: am i doing that 

460.26 462.37 B: did did you say you were doing that 

462.99 466.01 A: [mn] i'm sorry i didn't understand you [laughter] 

465.19 468.38 B: oh sorry no i i didn't quite hear what you you said 

468.32 473.82 A: oh i said that sounds like a g- that that's a good idea you can make money doing that actually [laughter] 

473.00 484.62 B: uh-huh yeah that's what i've heard it it's very tempting it's just that you know uh one doesn't have you you know they have the feedback thing so to start from the very beginning is rather complicated 

484.54 485.62 A: uh-huh 

485.21 485.93 B: (( so )) 

486.12 488.58 A: well you'd have to find things too i guess 

488.50 489.50 B: right 

488.60 490.82 A: the way to buy things at 

491.51 494.85 A: you know at i guess you can get i've heard of people 

494.90 498.07 A: buying stuff at garage sales and reselling them for 

498.84 502.83 A: like an obscene amount of money compared to what they spent [laughter] mhm mhm 

498.87 499.76 B: oh that's 

501.28 509.41 B: true [laughter] right i've also heard about people actually making things uh [mn] you know like semi art 

509.53 514.75 B: works and and apparently the profit margins on that are are really stupendous 

515.19 516.37 A: mhm 

515.76 516.64 B: so 

516.88 524.40 B: but i'm i'm not artistic at all a- at least not in cer- certainly not as far as making things and drawing pictures and stuff so 

524.50 526.86 B: so i i wouldn't be able to do that 

527.01 539.51 B: but yeah th- that that's actually something i i would like to do 'cause i can't really think of doing i i i mean i can't really imagine myself doing a full time business and somehow ebay seems sufficiently part time 

539.53 543.93 B: to not you know sound like it's what i'm doing 

544.07 546.67 B: um as a main job 

547.54 548.46 B: (( but um )) 

549.13 555.34 B: yeah that i i would probably like to set something like that up so it it's a lot less um 

555.98 561.84 B: it it's a lot less organized than um an accounting [laughter] firm yeah 

562.13 563.04 B: (( uh )) 

564.14 565.28 B: uh [sigh] 

568.72 570.32 B: so uh what 

570.48 572.22 B: what would you 

572.70 573.55 B: um 

574.34 580.94 B: would you have any advice or what what else i might do for [laughter] 

578.25 579.62 A: [laughter] 

580.75 585.93 A: i don't know i've i've seen people since i worked in retail before 

581.80 582.58 B: uh-huh 

585.56 586.64 B: mhm 

585.98 592.67 A: i've seen people buy things really cheap and i don't know if that's what they're doing you know they'll buy vast quantities of 

592.76 598.51 A: a certain item in the past or whatever i don't know like they'll buy it on clearance or something 

594.74 595.64 B: uh-huh 

597.87 599.95 B: right i've heard about the famous
