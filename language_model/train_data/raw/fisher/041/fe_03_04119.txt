20.53 22.61 B: oh oh you haven't 

22.39 24.05 A: no i haven't 

23.48 24.69 B: [laughter] 

24.41 29.99 A: so yeah that's what i was wondering what i'm supposed to say but i guess we are supposed to start talking about uh 

29.97 32.89 B: what kind of business we would open 

30.02 30.98 A: um 

32.24 35.82 A: yeah i think um do you wanna start first 

35.97 46.99 B: okay if money was no object i would open um probably a shelter for animals that have been abandoned abused don't have homes 

45.88 47.77 A: [noise] mhm [noise] 

48.16 52.07 A: and i think i would go i would uh open maybe like a [noise] 

52.19 54.81 A: um candy making place 

54.59 56.23 B: oh do you make candy 

56.23 58.13 A: i love making candy yes 

57.46 67.17 B: yeah i do that i craft too and i make a little bit of candy but you know not at a not at a big scale or anything like that just kinda play with it 

66.81 68.53 A: mhm mhm yeah 

67.43 69.48 B: but um what kinda candy do you make 

69.71 75.47 A: um i like to make um mostly like shaped candy in a like uh using molds and stuff 

72.92 73.83 B: uh-huh 

75.05 78.05 B: like chocolates or hard candies or 

77.49 79.20 A: yeah that like chocolates 

78.93 81.25 B: mm yeah i make those at home too 

79.22 80.09 A: so 

81.27 83.57 A: yeah so you know and the things [mn] 

83.71 88.23 A: i think it's because um you know everything is becoming so much [noise] more commercialized these days 

87.55 89.29 B: mhm 

88.49 92.75 A: and i think it would be more fun to make more personalized things 

92.36 93.98 B: uh-huh yeah 

92.85 98.15 A: you you know like like maybe for weddings [noise] and christmas and that kind of stuff 

97.76 98.64 B: uh-huh 

98.69 99.72 B: i under- 

98.71 100.71 A: [noise] i think i would like to do that 

99.84 104.46 B: i understand that is a great business i watched um oprah where a young 

102.02 102.66 A: (( [noise] )) 

104.49 112.76 B: uh couple of kids did it i think fifteen and sixteen they made their first like million dollars or something a year or two later 

107.00 107.57 A: (( [noise] )) 

107.58 110.79 A: [noise] mhm [noise] 

110.84 112.74 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

113.14 114.56 A: wow [noise] 

113.19 126.32 B: so yeah and that they just you know did it from home got their food handler's license did it from home and then posted a website that's what they did yeah so what was the next question we were supposed to talk about 

119.08 120.03 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

122.80 124.24 A: wow yeah 

125.92 136.54 A: we're supposed to talk how we would go about doing it you know um whatever business we would open how we would start doing it [sigh] and you know what necessary [noise] things we would do to make it successful 

128.87 129.60 B: (( mm )) 

136.35 137.19 B: oh 

137.37 138.12 A: so 

138.07 139.51 B: well i think that 

138.16 141.54 A: (( [noise] we are just supposed to continue talking about this i guess so )) 

140.99 148.33 B: yeah well i think for the pets i think that you know as as long as you have the establishment type of you know 

141.72 142.67 A: [laughter] 

143.28 144.22 A: [noise] 

148.13 149.16 A: mhm 

148.52 149.91 B: that um 

151.08 163.39 B: there is so little um outside of the humane society especially in my area that i don't think that it would be hard to take off all on its own it would be just getting the word of mouth out there to the public 

156.71 157.68 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] okay )) 

158.34 160.45 A: [noise] 

162.99 169.61 A: [noise] [noise] mhm mhm [noise] so what kind of stuff would you do i mean rescue animals or um is it something like that 

164.29 165.21 B: (( so )) 

169.55 183.27 B: well yeah i think that yeah i think that that could be a possibility maybe feral cats um you know that are getting into garbages don't have homes no humans to take care of them um spay and neuter animals um 

175.49 176.30 A: okay 

182.60 183.42 A: mhm 

183.31 192.74 B: dogs that have been abandoned or you know uh just don't have homes you know there's a lot of dogs that like rottweilers for example or pit bulls 

192.60 200.20 B: um people love them and think that they're great and everything but it's hard to keep them in inner city areas 

200.08 211.99 B: um they get too big they bark too much they don't get enough attention they don't run 'em enough and so they're surrendered to shelters and and what have you and it's hard to find homes for them after they're adult dogs 

212.44 213.64 B: so you know 

212.67 220.54 A: [noise] so and i would uh i i would guess you would have to um find uh you have to first take a license right in order to do that 

219.94 227.42 B: [sigh] i i i believe that you would you'd have to do some kind of license i i imagine it would be a kennel license 

227.23 228.12 A: okay 

228.97 229.53 B: (( [noise] )) 

229.02 241.32 A: a kennel license okay and so i mean do they just give it i i mean if you apply for it do you just get it or do you have to have some kind of you know like a income requirement or you know do you have to take a loan or something for that 

241.07 242.26 B: (( um i )) 

242.49 255.86 B: don't i'm not really sure um i you know 'cause they said that money was no object but to get the um license i think that that you may have to prove you know that you have an establishment that is able to 

244.46 245.31 A: mhm 

255.95 265.74 B: um you know handle a lot of pets and things like that or however many you can handle or something like that i'm not i'm not really familiar with it so 

265.91 268.25 B: i don't know but i'm guessing that 

268.64 271.19 B: you would have to have a license 

270.95 285.11 A: mhm yeah see from uh you know where i live you um to have anything like i mean even to make uh anything at home and commercially even not commercially as an outlet but even if you just wanna sell it to somebody you do have to take a license for that 

284.70 285.87 B: oh really 

285.55 299.99 A: yeah even for christmas like i mean you know if you're gonna charge money um for stuff like maybe for christmas you you know um you bake stuff and you sell you'd i know that you have to take a license for that you just can't you know 

295.58 296.46 B: uh-huh 

298.37 307.43 B: yeah i think that you do in my area as long as it i know that you do if it is um food items you have to have a food handler's license 

305.34 306.22 A: mhm 

307.24 310.06 A: mhm mhm that's right yeah [mn] 

308.24 309.05 B: so 

309.48 317.82 B: but i don't know i mean i do crafting stuff and i sell it online and at crafting bazaars and there is no license for that 

317.63 318.92 A: okay okay 

319.03 329.88 A: so um basically your ar- uh where you live they don't really require a crafter as long as it's not food they they really don't mind if you uh just go ahead and uh 

319.21 320.35 B: but i 

329.94 332.20 A: you know start the business and that kind of stuff 

331.09 341.72 B: if you're if you're doing it from inside your home i don't think that you have to have a business license to do it but i think that if you are setting up a uh doing business as 

337.53 338.34 A: okay 

341.83 351.34 B: i i know that you have to have a license to do that and if you're doing it in a building away from your home that you're doing a business at yeah yeah 

348.97 349.91 A: mhm 

350.66 363.05 A: so what about you know you [mn] do you know at these craft booths and stuff so if you have to put um your mon- i mean if you're gonna put your stuff in a craft booth like a craft mall um do you need a license for that kind of stuff 

357.48 358.29 B: (( [noise] )) 

359.34 360.43 B: mhm 

363.25 369.67 B: um we actually we're doing a fair this weekend and there is no license requirement for it so 

366.48 367.31 A: (( mhm )) 

369.17 370.18 A: (( oh i see )) 

369.72 379.70 B: yeah we we made um [lipsmack] uh soaps and uh little homemade soaps and and fizzies and things like that and 

378.97 380.30 A: oh how cool 

379.82 384.96 B: yeah there is no um license for that no it's just a one day thing though 

382.89 383.69 A: okay 

384.69 393.99 A: oh okay see that's what i would like to know i think the first thing i would go about finding out is um you know what i for what i need a license and what i don't need a license 

392.94 394.76 B: mhm mhm 

393.96 406.17 A: you know because um suppose like you said a fair like we have a homeowners' association that keeps having like a craft bazaar and you know like a spring springtime you know when spring comes they have the bazaars and all that 

405.43 406.77 B: mhm 

406.19 412.20 A: you know like a small you set up booths and you pay like um ten bucks a day or something to set up a stall 

410.75 411.77 B: right 

411.82 412.95 B: right 

412.16 425.08 A: you know i mean i would love to make stuff for that and sell but my biggest thing would be you know how i would go about doing it and i'd probably go online and you know maybe start checking um what i'm supposed to do first 

421.34 422.24 B: yeah 

424.69 426.07 B: right 

425.36 433.74 A: because i really don't wanna to get into any kind of you know like legal trouble or stuff so i'd rather have everything known to me upfront 

429.73 430.84 B: yeah 

433.06 440.49 B: right exactly well i have girlfriends who have done this for a long time who are crafters and so [sigh] you know i kind of 

434.03 434.83 A: (( [laughter] )) 

440.66 443.12 B: started going to a booth with them 

443.14 444.51 B: and um 

444.56 448.60 B: just used their knowledge that they already had so 

447.55 448.54 A: oh okay 

448.65 461.21 B: um but yeah i do know that if we wanted to sell suckers 'cause we have thought about doing that you have to have a food handler's license to prepare them and there has to be somebody there selling them with a food handler's license 

461.21 469.91 A: oh i see yeah see those i mean that would be my first thing i would wonder about i mean even you know because money is not an issue here you would just start off you know 

469.69 470.74 B: right 

470.51 472.86 A: with this uh my biggest thing would 

471.17 478.36 B: [sigh] and a food handler's license you can do you can take a food handler's license online and i think it's like fifteen dollars 

476.52 477.26 A: okay 

477.85 479.29 A: oh i see okay 

479.03 479.95 B: yeah 

479.46 489.67 A: and for i i'm sure i mean 'cause i'm sure where i live also you would find you know that you can get a license [noise] online and stuff so i mean that would be cool because i mean 

486.14 487.19 B: yeah 

489.65 497.28 A: the first thing you know my biggest hesitation is always oh i don't know what kind of um stuff they're gonna ask me like how 

497.61 505.93 A: i mean i i am clean but having kids at home and stuff it's hard to have a you know like a commercial based kitchen you know what i'm saying 

504.56 508.94 B: right well you know i understand that totally i have four rotties at home 

509.02 510.56 A: (( [laughter] okay )) 

509.52 516.44 B: yeah and so um you know we we always when we're preparing things and stuff we um 

517.10 521.92 B: uh like baby gate the kitchen off and kinda clean it down with bleach and everything 

519.43 520.27 A: mhm 

521.95 522.74 A: okay 

521.96 531.63 B: so yeah and that is an issue um you know because you don't want dog hair or things like that in your your um food contaminants and stuff so 

524.25 525.16 A: mhm 

529.61 535.72 A: oh i know oh my god that is yeah that is kind of scary i mean yeah i mean at least for those things you would 

532.44 533.79 B: yeah 

535.50 545.54 A: you know definitely want things like licenses and you know you wanna be as spotless i mean you know that's so that's that's your first starting point for quality control i would think right 

538.24 539.12 B: yeah 

545.10 546.57 B: i would imagine 

546.45 547.37 A: yeah 

546.72 552.54 B: yeah but you know you don't want somebody eating one of your um suckers that have a dog hair in it because 

552.60 554.29 B: [sigh] you know the best 

554.54 558.44 B: service is when word of mouth and people are gonna come back to you 

558.27 559.77 A: that's right that's right 

559.09 559.85 B: so 

559.92 565.09 A: so tell me more about your um uh you know your uh this pet thing do you um 

564.88 575.50 A: uh like a shel- is it like going to be like a shelter basically like you rescue and you keep them and you um try and find homes for these animals is that how you you would like to do it 

573.86 577.36 B: yeah that's what it yeah yeah that's what i'd like to do 

576.16 576.85 A: (( okay )) 

577.32 578.28 B: um 

578.04 583.83 B: but you know i i think that if money was no object whatsoever i would love to go over to 

583.59 594.45 B: other countries and do things like that aren't domestic animals i went to school to be a veterinarian i en- didn't end up being a veterinarian i got married and had a baby 

594.24 595.17 A: mhm 

594.77 599.90 B: but i think that going over to like africa and um helping giraffes
