16.06 18.81 B: mhm well i'd say you're a business owner 

16.78 18.01 A: and 

18.66 21.64 A: well i was an employee at the time 

21.32 22.65 B: mhm [laughter] 

22.19 27.79 A: so i wasn't necessarily responsible for all the supplies and 

27.40 28.46 B: yeah 

27.80 31.74 A: all of the you know paperwork that you have to file 

31.45 32.60 B: mhm 

33.62 40.92 B: do you think that you would uh be uh successful if you were operating that kind of business or that kind of work on your won 

40.84 46.58 A: [noise] i think i would um at this time i have three children so i 

42.54 43.48 B: (( uh-huh uh )) 

47.06 49.25 A: uh time constraints 

49.90 58.37 A: really made it so it was very difficult for me to make the kinda money that i would like but i was doing um 

55.56 56.71 B: mhm 

58.39 60.70 A: a good job and [noise] [sigh] 

62.63 64.15 A: getting um 

64.71 70.02 A: clients does that make sense i'm a fundraiser grant writer [noise] and um 

68.53 69.86 B: [noise] mhm oh i see 

70.11 71.29 A: um 

71.73 74.91 A: i also do freelance writing and so 

73.54 74.52 B: mhm 

75.12 81.13 A: it really um it's something you have to have a lot of time to yourself for [noise] 

80.48 89.20 B: [noise] [laughter] yeah yeah that's true i i uh have done some of that kind of work myself as well so i [laughter] certainly know what you mean 

87.70 88.40 A: (( [noise] )) 

90.09 90.98 B: but 

90.10 93.12 A: uh what kind of business would you like to um 

93.35 94.42 B: well i 

93.55 96.41 A: open up if money was no object 

95.87 100.58 B: well if money was no object i'd open up an art education business 

100.59 106.34 B: i've been in business for um some time as a consultant and uh 

107.53 120.01 B: [sigh] we operated this business uh fulltime for some years but i've been doing it occasionally since then but if i was going to do something on my own i'd love to do something like art education where you would 

119.93 125.42 B: um have a workshop where people could experience different types of art activities 

125.56 130.78 B: i think that um adults would love to play as children do 

130.83 137.63 B: in terms of learning different kinds of art techniques and um being able to create things that they would enjoy 

138.28 144.08 A: i think it would also be a really good business to target to the home school community 

143.58 146.22 B: mhm boy that certainly is true 

144.62 145.38 A: becau- 

145.93 154.17 A: because there's a lot of home schoolers that um love those kind of electives and because they 

148.85 149.76 B: mhm 

152.40 153.45 B: mhm 

154.21 161.63 A: are at home they don't have sometimes the resources a school has so they look for outlets like that 

158.55 159.63 B: mhm 

160.94 165.53 B: mhm yeah that's a an interesting kind of market for it 

165.72 168.27 B: yeah i i intend to 

168.33 177.55 B: um undertake some of those things uh as i retire in another year or so but on a volunteer basis with youth groups 

173.81 174.76 A: uh-huh 

177.81 182.37 B: or maybe i'll organize my own youth group [laughter] 

181.55 183.56 A: well i know that um 

183.71 188.12 A: you know if you target adults you'd be limited on the times 

187.55 188.92 B: mhm 

188.85 193.08 A: but with the home school community you can target the daytime hours 

192.36 193.43 B: mhm 

193.30 194.82 A: which is nice 

194.30 199.72 B: yeah that that would be nice because um i think it's an interesting idea because 

199.80 208.79 B: i'm sure that uh women who are or men who are home schooling their children would like a little time to themselves towards the end of the day too 

209.01 210.27 A: oh yeah 

209.29 211.28 B: [laughter] 

210.28 214.55 A: i speak as a home school mom [laughter] 

211.99 215.37 B: uh-huh [laughter] 

214.56 218.29 A: and it's it's nice to have one 

218.77 228.14 A: other thing taken off of your shoulders that you know it's taken care of and they're they're learning the subject well and someone else has taken the time to prepare 

220.93 221.82 B: mhm 

224.77 225.66 B: mhm 

228.00 228.90 B: mhm 

228.16 233.62 A: and to gather all the supplies and it's it's just one of those things that gives you 

230.47 231.26 B: yeah 

233.71 238.53 A: peace of mind that your children are learning something um well 

238.35 241.73 B: [mn] and it would provide a social activity too mhm 

240.80 244.57 A: exactly and they need that they really do need that 

243.16 245.22 B: mhm yeah yeah 

244.91 248.81 A: so um i know my my girls take piano 

248.63 249.50 B: mhm 

248.85 255.29 A: and then the oldest takes tai kwan do and the youngest was for a while but she decided to go for track 

254.91 255.99 B: (( mhm )) 

255.36 261.58 A: and so that gives them some outlet and they have you know the libraries have um [lipsmack] 

262.12 266.04 A: sometimes groups that meet in them and um 

266.35 267.36 A: you know 

267.87 275.19 A: down um at the roller rinks or different places like that sometimes they cater to home schoolers with classes but 

274.50 275.92 B: mhm 

275.25 278.27 A: it's nice when those kinds of things open 

278.03 282.27 B: mhm hm are there a lot of people in your area who are doing home schooling 

282.10 283.30 A: oh yes 

283.09 283.95 B: (( mm )) 

283.36 284.84 A: oh yes i w- 

284.04 285.29 B: where do you live 

285.19 288.32 A: i live in the greater seattle area 

287.76 289.20 B: oh yeah uh-huh 

288.52 289.73 A: and 

290.37 303.88 A: we were part of a home school group that was running about sixty families and that was about a hundred and fifty kids and that's just in the city of renton itself proper and we're only one of the home school groups that 

294.87 295.75 B: mhm 

296.98 297.83 B: mhm 

299.62 300.49 B: (( mhm mm )) 

303.76 304.72 B: (( mhm )) 

304.11 305.01 A: um 

305.03 316.19 A: operate so it's a pretty l- it it's growing all the time the movement is and um there's a lot of possibility if i had an opportunity to 

316.53 321.00 A: open any kind of store i would love to do a bookstore 

320.75 321.97 B: mhm 

321.35 323.01 A: with um 

323.80 334.16 A: [lipsmack] supplies and resources for for home schooling families as well as pre schools and daycares and churches that provide you know activities for children 

326.43 327.56 B: mhm 

330.49 331.44 B: mhm 

333.96 334.84 B: mhm 

334.17 336.82 A: and then have workshops on site 

336.52 337.56 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

336.92 338.84 A: that provide [lipsmack] 

339.41 343.60 A: different um courses for the moms to take 

342.60 344.62 B: mhm [noise] mhm 

344.19 346.37 A: in helping them 

346.61 349.30 A: with the learning curve and and 

349.79 353.15 A: what it takes to uh school their own children 

352.86 353.80 B: (( mhm mm )) 

353.65 363.84 A: and um [lipsmack] there was a there was actually a business here in renton that was extraordinarily successful the gal that owned it 

363.97 368.27 A: um [lipsmack] lived in bel- bellingham which is about 

368.30 376.06 A: two to three hours north of us and it just was too um difficult logistically for her to 

370.09 371.01 B: mhm 

374.99 375.70 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

376.21 383.00 A: manage both stores so she let this one go she tried to find someone to own it at the time and it didn't really work for us 

382.56 383.43 B: (( hm )) 

383.08 384.16 A: but 

384.42 389.30 A: i think it would be a real joy and our family loves books 

388.90 390.08 B: mhm 

389.57 390.74 A: so 

390.85 392.94 A: it would be fun to just 

393.09 399.54 A: stock a l- a a wonderful assortment of books and curriculums and supplies and 

397.82 398.67 B: mhm 

399.99 406.41 A: have a a resource center there for families so that's what i would like to do 

403.97 405.39 B: mhm 

405.66 413.92 B: well and you could do um classes for kids too i mean i could see this really really being an active place [laughter] 

410.49 412.96 A: oh of course art classes 

413.06 417.82 A: yes it would be a very active place it has a lot of potential so 

414.84 416.53 B: mhm mhm 

417.19 418.31 B: yeah 

418.08 428.22 A: you know it would be nice to have a grant [laughter] from the small business administration or you know it would just 

422.89 425.00 B: [laughter] 

426.13 427.54 B: (( mm )) 

428.28 431.26 A: it that would help for start up funds but 

430.58 431.48 B: mhm 

432.02 436.36 A: i think it takes a- a lot of commitment and dedication and long hours 

435.92 437.37 B: yeah yeah 

436.69 439.14 A: and right now with our children small 

438.84 439.91 B: mhm 

439.28 443.01 A: that's more than we're willing to invest 

443.03 447.23 B: oh i would be nice if you could do that with a a partner too 

447.21 449.52 A: of course another family 

447.31 447.89 B: (( um )) 

448.95 450.82 B: yeah mhm 

449.95 457.62 A: [lipsmack] who would be willing to help carry that i agree that would be a great partnership it would have to be the right individual 

452.66 454.51 B: mhm mhm mhm 

457.19 458.40 B: yeah 

458.95 462.21 A: with a s- similar um commitment level 

461.91 463.25 B: yeah 

463.48 475.70 B: yeah i c- i could see that really working because uh you know it's s- so obviously a benefit to uh the groups that you know and uh with you know the right kind of interest and a 

475.83 480.57 B: um partner family that would i think that would really work 

480.25 481.65 A: well it would just s- 

480.56 488.62 B: i worked with a partner [sigh] for um oh i guess well it was quite a while really for about 

488.03 488.96 A: uh-huh 

488.62 501.49 B: six or eight years and um [lipsmack] it was just really a nice arrangement and our husbands joined the partnership too and they they were each doing something entirely different from what we were doing but 

501.50 507.87 B: i- it was just really a nice arrangement because we were able to um you know share some of the 

507.96 512.54 B: um common cost for the thing and uh it was a 

513.43 523.87 B: [lipsmack] sort of um [lipsmack] how should you say a community [laughter] um with just two couples even to uh be able to share in these kinds of interests 

523.54 525.19 A: (( [noise] [noise] well and )) 

525.36 529.60 A: [cough] i mean excuse me the business what can just target the home school community 

529.66 530.77 A: it would 

531.16 533.10 A: you know it would have a broad 

533.30 534.79 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

535.16 539.10 A: draw from the daycares and the 

537.53 538.40 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

539.29 540.93 A: pre schools and the 

541.29 544.90 A: childcare centers in the area and the churches 

544.69 545.55 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

545.30 549.39 A: so as far as the supply and curriculum end of things 

549.89 564.31 B: do you think that people who are home schooling would be in a position to purchase those kinds of things i mean i guess that's one of the advantages of schools is that they have more purchasing power you know you can 

564.49 572.97 B: you can purchase more materials and books and so on and so forth 'cause it's gonna be used by a lot of kids but come to think of it i guess you could well you know what i think the c- the um the home 

572.21 574.11 A: (( i think it )) 

575.57 576.44 A: (( i )) 

576.44 577.25 B: (( schoolers that i know )) 

576.45 582.80 A: are really keen on buying these so that would be a a good venue is used curriculum 

578.71 579.55 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

580.93 583.80 B: oh yeah you could recycle 'em too huh 

583.55 587.89 A: exactly and so we often look for uh 

588.42 595.16 A: curriculum that's non consumable that means it's not a bunch a text books or works book oriented 

594.47 595.86 B: yeah 

595.41 599.88 A: kinds of things um the other things is uh often
