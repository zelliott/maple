76.03 76.87 B: (( we )) 

77.47 82.05 B: yeah [laughter] what's the job market like out there 

78.68 79.28 A: (( [sigh] )) 

81.74 82.66 A: (( uh )) 

83.33 88.53 A: it's not too good 'cause everybody's getting out of school right now and scrambling to get jobs 

86.55 87.44 B: right 

88.37 95.95 B: yeah yeah it it well it's tough out here too i've been out here since uh january and uh it's it's hard to find work

96.28 98.20 B: you know and uh so 

98.30 99.26 B: um 

99.34 110.82 B: i've i thought of starting my own business through the years and it just the the government makes it a lot tougher on um patriots than than on people coming in 

110.58 111.72 A: yeah 

111.12 114.52 B: you know government loans etcetera so it can be uh 

114.63 115.98 A: it's a little tougher 

115.87 118.40 B: uh tougher and it's it's very risky 

118.25 121.90 A: yeah 'cause you're basically putting your money where your mouth is 

118.51 120.76 B: you know you've got a whole lot to lose 

121.42 125.48 B: mhm and nowadays you know i mean gosh wha- 

125.33 125.99 A: (( [mn] )) 

125.62 130.46 B: what's left you know there's a whole lot that you could open that that would be unique

132.96 135.71 A: now there are things that are needed but 

137.29 140.31 A: i mean if i had a choice of what i could do 

140.45 144.71 A: and if i had an unlimited source of money i'd probably open a paintball store 

144.66 145.68 B: uh-huh 

145.36 147.25 A: 'cause that's what i do and 

146.61 147.87 B: oh okay 

147.42 148.54 A: well 

148.71 150.99 A: there's not one for forty miles 

150.48 152.41 B: [laughter] 

152.08 156.64 A: you know i don't like driving forty miles every time i need to get something 

153.54 154.62 B: yeah 

157.21 162.54 B: i bet you forty miles in pennsylvania's not like forty miles in southern cal 

162.39 163.42 A: no 

163.03 166.06 B: or even in texas where i came from 

165.71 167.50 A: here at least you can go 

167.59 169.83 A: at a relative speed 

169.49 170.62 B: right 

170.07 171.92 A: out there it's probably gridlock 

171.77 179.23 B: [lipsmack] uh d- depending on the time of day um in texas i- it texas is the worse traffic i've ever been in in my life 

178.08 179.90 A: (( mm yeah )) 

179.32 184.95 B: but uh southern cal yeah the people it moves pretty good but there's so much traffic um 

184.55 186.43 A: yeah so many people 

185.02 185.87 B: (( you know )) 

186.10 200.88 B: yeah so many people and uh so yeah you get a little of that on each end um [lipsmack] i've been to upstate new york and i think we came down into just a corner of pennsylvania i'm not real familiar with the east coast at all 

200.28 200.98 A: (( mm )) 

200.93 202.20 B: but uh 

202.53 213.62 B: yeah you know i mean it's it's all about trade off we don't have brutal winters and you know you don't have all the crap that we associate living in southern cal 

205.65 207.46 A: (( exactly )) 

213.86 214.78 A: true 

214.61 215.52 B: so

283.29 284.13 A: no 

286.66 287.93 A: yeah winters 

289.89 297.47 A: yeah but then again winters were a little colder and it was more normal to see a foot or two of snow 

296.99 298.34 B: yeah 

298.31 302.26 A: remember ninety seven it was like we were in awe we had eight foot drifts 

301.94 303.53 B: [laughter]

341.55 342.86 B: mm that's funny

381.67 388.09 B: the other weather but i couldn't handle an earthquake and it's like i've been in three earthquakes since i've been born 

386.86 389.64 A: (( hm )) 

388.14 396.49 B: and you know every year you see these tornadoes and hurricanes going through central u._s._a. so i i don't understand that

435.59 436.70 A: yeah 

437.84 439.94 A: mm nope 

439.79 440.71 B: (( huh ))
