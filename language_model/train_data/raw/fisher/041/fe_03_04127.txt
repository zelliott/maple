491.34 494.86 A: (( like wow it's amazing yeah like i learned how )) 

491.45 501.27 B: yeah i mean who specializes in curtains that that that's like such a niche market if you can do like really good curtains then people would come to you for curtains and that's that's that 

502.22 503.06 B: huh 

503.19 504.39 A: (( to oil )) 

504.64 510.33 A: (( paint last summer and like we had a cocktail party here and my friends were like walking around looking at some ))

518.23 521.64 B: yeah i mean that that's like a whole that's like a whole 'nother thing 

521.06 529.86 A: (( that i'm like it's really not that good [laughter] but i think again they're so afraid to like take a risk in the in the art area that they like just think it's amazing and )) 

523.70 524.66 B: oh really 

530.17 533.69 A: (( it it cracked me up i just hang out with like super conservative )) 

533.08 533.98 B: yeah 

534.51 536.09 A: (( people i think )) 

536.23 537.98 A: (( that's what it is 'cause )) 

538.26 540.36 A: (( they're mostly my husband's friends )) 

540.80 545.79 A: (( and they're all doctors and lawyers and they're very )) 

546.44 548.67 A: (( they're just very conservative thinkers )) 

548.04 549.66 B: i wonder why that is 

549.36 553.25 A: (( and so they wanna surround themselves by i mean they they try to surround themselves )) 

553.22 556.03 B: oh okay well that that maybe [laughter] that's part of it 

555.12 560.19 A: (( by it like good music and art but they don't they're not really you know creators )) 

560.33 562.59 A: (( they're not really )) 

562.60 571.58 B: but at the same time they there's a really de- i mean like i have friends that are that are doctors as well and they have a real desire to like somehow connect with like the artistic side but they don't really know 

571.31 573.15 A: (( creators )) 

572.61 576.55 B: (( how right )) 

579.57 581.45 A: absolutely yeah 

581.26 594.02 B: so maybe that would be that's like a really good target market in general [laughter] if you're on the creative side like you should you know market your work towards uh towards people that uh you know spend all their all their days in a very academic or a very like a logical environment 

584.34 585.96 A: (( yeah [laughter] you're )) 

593.47 594.62 A: (( right right )) 

596.10 598.11 A: (( [noise] absolutely ))
