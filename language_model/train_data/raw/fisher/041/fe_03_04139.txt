0.22 1.59 B: brian scott 

1.78 3.43 A: i'm chris 

3.33 4.64 B: you're chris 

4.67 5.67 A: yes 

4.76 6.58 B: well hi chris how are you 

6.66 8.38 A: doing fine how are you doing 

7.81 9.80 B: doing fine where are you calling from 

9.25 12.15 A: [noise] uh d._c. washington d._c. 

11.55 16.28 B: washington d._c. well then well i guess we're we're kinda neighbors i'm i- i'm in uh virginia beach 

16.15 18.86 A: oh okay yeah so only a few miles away cool 

18.13 23.93 B: yeah okay so we're supposed to talk about um opening our own business if money's not an issue 

23.90 24.90 A: (( right [sigh] )) 

24.63 27.99 B: okay so i guess how how would you go about this 

26.64 29.48 A: (( um [lipsmack] i )) 

29.50 39.92 A: don't know i i i'm like actually very non business which is the sort of last question like would you be essential business owner um i 

40.59 46.26 A: [mn] i'm think of a of a business and i guess it would be computer consulting of a kind 

46.04 47.02 B: really 

46.31 49.75 A: um yeah and in uh in uh 

50.74 60.05 A: the business i guess would it it would be see i i work in non profits because like i think of providing services not necessarily running a business 

59.44 60.37 B: uh-huh 

60.16 69.33 A: so it's not if it doesn't matter that i make money then what i'd be doing is doing like a bridge like the the the information gap that you have between 

69.31 77.70 A: people it's not even the schools good but the the facilities available to them aren't so great and people you know we have 

74.98 75.95 B: right 

77.78 82.82 A: in a local library a a city library here which is you know in any 

83.82 93.58 A: municipal area would be under funded you know has turned into kind of a social service like where she she let there's computers provided and so she 

89.17 90.08 B: uh-huh 

93.36 103.45 A: the librarian there has over the years gotten people off the streets and jobs because she says i'll teach you how to look for a job online 

103.45 114.88 A: and look at these job listings that people don't have access to if they don't have a computer you know h- th- and so i think thinking now like that's the thing that i'd 

108.62 109.53 B: right 

114.71 121.58 A: i think i could do and and and enjoy i'm not a technical compute- like i'm not a consultant person like where people 

121.73 131.21 A: in business would need it it would s- people who don't have access to it now and need to get it that kind of thing so prov- [mn] either providing that or at least teaching 

125.45 126.60 B: (( mhm )) 

131.90 136.40 A: i think i'd like to do that um 

134.26 138.51 B: let me ask you something do you know how to build computers or would you know if no 

136.71 138.07 A: (( [mn] no )) 

138.28 139.63 A: no i'm [mn] 

138.38 153.27 B: yeah 'cause see i'll tell you here here's the reason why i say that is because i in school uh when i was going to the university of missouri in uh kansas city um one of my my essays or one of my the jobs or i i don't i guess one of my reports was 

141.12 141.86 A: yeah 

153.25 156.26 B: doing exactly this opening up your own business 

156.15 166.64 B: and what i had put together was a business that would would be uh going to these these different companies all over the area say like in d._c. and that are 

166.53 176.52 B: th- these companies that are throwing away computers because there's tons of them including government um well basically government's probably the biggest thing social service soci- not social security um 

176.43 189.19 B: the i._r._s. throws 'em away every year they they go out and buy brand new computers and they just basically they pitch 'em in a dumpster and getting a hold of these computers basically refurbishing them and then taking them to 

178.77 179.55 A: right 

189.17 199.91 B: you know some type of a like some type of a big ware- warehouse where you would actually refurbish them and now they did this in kansas city and this guy was doing a phenomenal business he was getting 

199.83 208.12 B: contributions all the time hard drives computers monitors he would fix them up and then he would turn them over the less fortunate 

208.04 215.08 B: and in some cases he would also teach them how to use the computer that way they themselves could 

215.11 223.70 B: um basically be computer literate versus illiterate and would also help the kids in s- in their um you know in their their their their reports 

223.57 224.70 A: yeah 

224.11 235.08 B: and it's something that it i wish that i'd you know i had the i wish i had the funding or i had the know how here i mean there i would because i i was from kansas city and i i just moved here four years ago and i don't know 

224.90 225.62 A: huh 

234.94 249.85 B: uh i don't know too many people here at all and it really takes someone like if you've been in d._c. a for a long time if you know people i mean basically get a whole lot of people behind you to basically somewhat fund you and it wouldn't even really take a whole lot of money 

249.48 259.99 A: [noise] [noise] yeah it's it's it's amazing uh in terms of what people will fund in uh a- and what they won't accept because i had a company i was working with 

259.76 270.82 A: where we switched over all the computers in the in the office and they were two or three year- years old and i couldn't get anybody to take them i offered them to the school they said we don't want them because we don't know how to use them 

263.28 264.18 B: mhm 

270.21 271.30 B: mhm 

270.91 278.53 A: and you'd have to i mean [mn] as you were saying like the the extra bit you to give the the computers to the school i would've had to 

278.93 285.19 A: spend ten hours a week making sure that they didn't break and teaching people how to use them 

284.59 285.82 B: right 

285.23 292.04 A: where they because they were macintoshes and they just like no we want they they come and they want pentium three i._b._m.s 

291.55 293.24 B: right 

293.25 306.25 A: and they actually i mean it it's l it's literally like you know you uh [mn] you give them they don't actually want it because it's not good enough for them and then it just goes to wa- we have you know the the resell there's a reseller in uh 

306.30 312.57 A: n- uh northern virginia i mean 'bout ten minutes over over the river as i would call it 

312.61 318.50 A: and they have a whole store and it's full and the stuff they sell 

318.49 322.58 A: like it's a reseller like you come in there and do uh on a on a consignment 

322.47 337.07 A: and [mn] more than a year old in i._b._m.s or macintoshes nobody buys 'em because there's so many of 'em that they're get even the the the six month old one if somebody's already still pr- already turning that over 

328.69 329.54 B: right 

336.64 337.80 B: exactly 

337.11 346.22 A: for four hundred bucks instead of four hundred bucks for a f- two year a a year old and so that rate is so high that um i 

338.22 338.99 B: yeah 

345.03 346.28 B: it's not worth it 

346.29 350.91 A: i i'm yeah i'm saying like pe- is that they fall behind like you can't do the recycling 

350.51 351.49 B: (( let's hear it )) 

350.92 358.57 A: um because that year there reason they're getting rid of it is just it's completely so far behind all of a sudden 

358.56 366.68 A: that uh th- th- th- that's why that turnover is i mean they're t- they're talking about this article just recently about that is somewhat slowing down 

366.31 367.28 B: right 

366.66 374.63 A: be so that the economy and people are saying like co- bill- companies are whatever like fifty percent of the co- 

374.76 385.81 A: computer market is people buy you know the company buying a new computer every year so they do it they're extending the lifetime to two years and that's gonna crash that's gonna kill the computer industry evidently 

378.79 379.69 B: right 

381.61 382.83 B: exactly 

385.86 387.06 B: that's true 

385.90 387.02 A: um 

387.65 394.13 A: [lipsmack] so yeah i mean it's funny like a- and w- w- actually it was funny when uh the with the question 

394.17 398.34 A: starting is with would you start your business i mean i don't do that at all like i don't do 

398.89 401.61 A: anything that i would consider socially ac- i mean 

401.66 413.50 A: b- i i work right now in non profit with international development with agriculture which is so socially responsible that it's like i i'd i've never done in any capacity 

406.71 407.57 B: uh-huh 

413.47 421.16 A: one of these kinda like more local projects which is kind of what i was talking about starting a business but i was trying to think of something where 

415.66 416.63 B: uh-huh 

421.37 427.13 A: if i could do anything where it would [mn] i'd keep on [mn] when it says 

427.24 432.86 A: do business i'd start thinking of concrete goals and you have sort of have to say a 

432.51 433.38 B: right 

432.63 443.98 A: specific thing where what i do right now is very very long term big idea like let's just talk about this and filter out idea and very more much more amorphous 

444.06 446.02 A: so it's kinda funny just to how they 

446.19 450.20 A: that focused my head a little bit and turned me away from what i actually do 

449.82 450.72 B: sure 

450.57 451.66 A: (( um )) 

450.75 462.09 B: well it is kinda funny you were talking about computer consulting that's what i kinda do on a part time basis i've been doing this now for what about five or six years with my wife we have our own business called j. g. f. uh systems 

453.80 454.79 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

461.93 462.77 A: mhm 

461.98 469.43 B: and i do computer consulting and it's a real real real competitive market out there because everybody and their brother is doing the same exact thing 

469.31 480.57 B: and i guess going back to this niche about instead of you know i mean yeah you could still make money in doing this refurbishing computers and giving back to community because 

469.66 470.32 A: (( [noise] )) 

480.41 492.49 B: you know there are a lot of government grants out there in fact i was out on the winternet together with my camera w- about three weeks ago it was and there were several different government grants that are in excess of a hundred grand each 

492.43 496.29 B: that would allow you to it's uh to commeet- 

492.55 493.35 A: yeah 

496.31 510.17 B: like a urban development or community development type of grant and it would still fall into that same exact category all you have to do is present your outline and your objectives 

510.06 518.69 B: and your goals and how you're going to obtain this and fill out this application and turn it into a certain agency i don't remember what it was 

518.39 519.45 A: right 

518.89 524.83 B: and there's like f- uh three or four there was three or four of these grants that were available 

525.00 534.67 B: so you know it's like okay that's that that in itself okay that's that's a good way to start making money and then of course then you get these private investors or private funders 

525.36 526.67 A: yeah 

534.74 541.85 B: and now all of a sudden you have yourself your own pay check but you're not selling 

541.99 546.66 B: computers you're giving them away and you're also training people to 

546.74 553.03 B: use a computer for not only for school but also for maybe a future business 

548.26 549.27 A: right 

553.57 554.67 A: yeah 

554.07 561.02 B: so it's it's really i mean this i tell you when you talk computers you can go a lotta different ways with this 

561.84 563.07 B: you really can 

563.05 564.39 A: (( [sigh] [sigh] yeah )) 

563.80 571.25 B: so initially and it really doesn't take a whole lot of know how it really doesn't i mean i i myself am now a 

571.43 581.29 B: c- college graduate i mean i don't have a a b._a. or a masters degree a lot of what i've learned is basically from on the job training 

581.41 582.75 A: yeah 

582.17 586.94 B: and you j- and then all then then all it takes is just practice 

587.44 598.18 B: you know doing it day in and day out which is what i was doing in my job i built computers from scratch and you know uh uh upgraded computers from scratch and the whole nine yards 

598.03 599.95 A: [noise] [sigh] [noise] [sigh] yeah i think for for 

598.61 599.51 B: so
