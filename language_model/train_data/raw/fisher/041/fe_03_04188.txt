166.45 172.52 B: yeah they have a t. shirt store but they don't i mean they don't necessarily you can't custom make them 

172.39 173.92 A: [lipsmack] oh okay 

173.71 176.85 B: and and that's what and that's more what i've been looking at is just

186.03 189.26 A: is the equipment to do that expensive

189.80 192.05 B: yeah the screen printing's pretty expensive 

192.45 194.80 A: [lipsmack] and uh does it take up a lotta space 

194.89 195.76 B: um 

196.01 204.02 B: not usually uh it's just a little i mean you just put your t. shirt on it and uh you have your print you pr- you print it off of the computer 

200.19 201.03 A: mhm 

204.15 210.47 B: and it's just a little whatever size you want your your print to be and it just goes wherever on the t. shirt you want

213.92 215.33 B: (( [sigh] uh )) 

214.42 216.31 A: like if you had a big order 

216.32 218.95 A: that you had to do how long 

219.97 223.03 A: w- how many could you print in a short amount of time 

223.88 228.02 B: [noise] i'd say like fifty like you you could do fifty in about an hour 

227.53 228.93 A: with one machine 

228.50 229.77 B: yeah 

228.96 230.48 A: [noise] wow 

230.75 238.68 B: yeah it it's it's not that hard it's really not that's why i have thought about it i'm like well this'll be easy enough [laughter] you know but 

230.83 232.02 A: [noise] wow 

237.97 245.03 A: so what just out of curiosity i don't even know if you know this like w- one machine to do that what do they cost 

244.45 246.44 B: i i honestly don't know 

246.66 247.55 A: hm 

247.74 248.30 A: (( [noise] )) 

248.44 252.12 B: just just because i mean i i have access to one 

251.91 252.88 A: mhm 

252.24 253.25 B: (( um )) 

253.43 257.30 A: [noise] so they actually you had a class in high school where you were able to do that 

256.04 259.99 B: yeah yep i took a class in high school and in junior high for it 

259.60 261.30 A: [noise] oh you're kidding [noise] 

260.41 265.16 B: (( no hm mm [noise] [noise] no when i was in junior high it was a um [noise] )) 

261.64 262.58 A: (( o._h. [noise] )) 

265.40 273.58 B: like an explorer class you took it with a whole bunch of other things like home ec and stuff like that and then in high school it was one class that you could take 

270.83 271.88 A: mhm 

274.09 275.02 B: so 

275.38 276.94 B: yeah it was pretty interesting 

277.14 278.91 A: (( [lipsmack] [noise] huh [noise] [noise] )) 

278.63 280.80 B: as as far as your herbal 

281.05 281.96 B: herbal 

282.24 285.38 B: store i mean where do you get supplies like that [noise] 

284.64 296.23 A: [noise] [noise] [lipsmack] well um just recently i know like i've been able to go online and find different things i've been drinking a lot of hibiscus tea which is basically just the hibiscus flower 

287.45 288.84 B: [noise] 

290.09 290.93 B: mhm 

296.27 306.99 A: and all you do is add four leaves to a i mean four flowers [noise] to water and sugar and you have [noise] a flowered tea and it is really really good 

301.97 302.96 B: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

306.96 312.59 A: those sort of things real simple so some things you could do yourself but i've been going online and accessing 

312.65 313.60 A: herbs 

313.53 314.32 B: uh-huh 

313.66 321.74 A: and um [lipsmack] there's a little tiny store here fairly close to me where um that is entirely what 

321.83 324.07 A: this store does um 

322.97 323.78 B: uh-huh 

324.61 339.38 A: [lipsmack] and i thought well more and more people want to go more natural in their products and um but i think there is also [mn] any more nowadays like with the bigger stores like wild oats and those kind of things there's a lotta competition too so 

330.04 331.36 B: yeah 

338.15 339.13 B: mhm 

339.30 344.23 B: [noise] yeah we don't have too many [noise] stores like that here uh 

339.51 340.78 A: i think to [noise] 

343.39 344.83 A: oh really [noise] 

344.32 346.10 B: yeah and then we have a lotta the 

345.41 345.97 A: (( [noise] )) 

346.16 351.49 B: athletic sports stores but we don't have many herbal stores like that i went to 

346.38 347.63 A: (( oh )) 

347.98 349.13 A: okay 

351.59 360.54 B: when i was pregnant i went to one store and that was the only store i found and they were had a whole bunch of herbal remedies and stuff for for dealing with 

360.63 366.88 B: morning sickness and stuff like that but that's the only store i've ever seen in this area like that [sigh] so that's kinda interesting 

362.47 364.09 A: (( [noise] right )) 

366.55 367.52 A: huh 

368.09 377.61 A: well i've been you know thinking about it just trying to get away from especially with people thinking about getting away from antibiotics as much because we've become so dependent 

376.94 378.41 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

377.86 386.23 A: so trying to think of um with my own family finding more [mn] and you know you have to like you probably learned in pregnancy you have to be real careful with herbs 

385.54 387.99 B: yeah what you can take [laughter] [noise] 

386.42 393.37 A: and um yeah and so i you know i just had a baby here she'll be two months on wednesday [lipsmack] um 

393.56 402.19 A: there were things that definitely during preg- i didn't even go near herbs because i didn't wanna chance what was not safe and what was i didn't wanna have to think about it 

401.03 401.93 B: yeah 

402.29 405.51 A: but um but i love 

402.32 403.78 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

404.05 412.13 B: yeah that was a big thing she was like well you need to be careful what you take but this is okay and this is okay and i was i was really amazed by how much you actually could 

409.17 410.60 A: [laughter] 

411.88 417.44 A: that's true there is a lot more that you can actually take there are some specific things that you can't but 

416.74 417.90 B: yeah 

417.68 418.54 A: um 

421.00 429.11 A: um but for me to have a business like that again it would be you know finding the funding 

428.77 429.91 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

429.35 436.18 A: to to do that um [lipsmack] and i can't remember all the questions they wanted us to ask do you remember 'em [laughter] 

435.84 437.82 B: no [laughter] do you well 

437.85 439.91 B: do you have a place where you would do it 

440.32 453.12 A: oh no see that if i was just doing uh starting out small i would just deal with friends but i don't know based on the fact that it is herbs and it's food related i don't know if you'd have to get 

446.42 447.29 B: uh-huh 

452.77 454.63 B: special permits or anything 

453.93 457.68 A: [lipsmack] exactly and that would be a hindrance to do something like that 

457.71 465.54 A: um every now and then you run across buildings that um are being vacated in smaller shopping centers um 

464.82 465.56 B: (( [noise] yeah mm )) 

465.77 474.31 A: but to start off on my own business i wouldn't have a site at all i'd probably start by doing what a lotta people do and just have a website 

474.02 475.33 B: yeah 

474.87 477.40 A: [lipsmack] and put word of mouth out that way 

475.51 476.87 B: and doing it from home 

477.65 480.67 A: which would be the same thing you could do with t. shirts 

480.32 481.31 B: yeah 

481.05 487.91 A: you know once you had your own equipment you could have a website and go from there 

487.84 489.31 B: yeah 

489.90 495.39 A: and i don't even know if that cost a lot of money to do a website or to own a website 

490.01 491.08 B: (( [noise] we have )) 

495.28 505.90 B: actually my brother has a website himself that he had to do on boy scouts and it didn't cost him anything it was just a free website yeah yeah a free website to get it started so 

498.83 499.67 A: oh 

501.60 503.07 A: really 

505.76 508.36 A: with boy scouts for a an eagle project 

507.75 509.08 B: uh-huh yeah 

508.48 509.73 A: oh cool 

509.47 514.30 B: yep so he had to do all of that so he knows all about that stuff [laughter] 

514.39 518.64 B: it's just the other stuff nobody really knows about the ins and outs of business 

519.09 521.52 B: [lipsmack] we've all worked for companies before 

521.42 522.65 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

522.68 528.58 A: and i was a schoolteacher for a lotta years and decided to stay home but there's always that part of mind okay 

528.68 532.22 A: what can we do to make some extra income 'cause it's hard [laughter] 

530.03 531.10 B: yeah 

531.47 532.41 B: yeah 

533.09 535.52 A: um we just had our i'm sorry 

533.11 534.13 B: (( yeah if i )) 

535.34 542.12 B: just thinking about doing something from home i mean just to stay home 'cause my son will be two in august and i'm just like 

540.72 542.82 A: oh and you just have the one 

542.59 552.73 B: yeah yeah and i work eight hours a day from eleven to or from three to eleven and it's like if i could just stay home with home [laughter] be a lot better [sigh] 

547.98 549.25 A: oh my gosh 

550.71 552.54 A: right 

552.64 561.68 A: i just had my fourth child and up until my first three were born each one i taught and this last one i just decided to stay home but 

554.37 555.13 B: (( oh [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

561.70 575.27 A: it's it's hard to do that it's hard to be the working mom and struggle to do that and it's hard to stay home and find out okay if i had a business from home well then i still have to worry about what my children are doing i have to spend time with them 

573.37 574.52 B: (( yeah yeah [laughter] )) 

575.07 575.87 B: yeah 

575.97 581.12 A: so it's it's kinda complicated to [laughter] ponder all that 

580.73 581.86 B: yeah 

584.76 589.01 B: but m- my thing with him staying home and everything is just since i do work 

588.97 589.81 A: mhm 

589.57 593.36 B: three to eleven it's just [mn] i'd really have no time with him 

593.37 594.43 A: no 

593.61 595.14 B: and and that would be 

595.39 596.40 A: idea 

595.41 597.93 B: that'd be a convenience [laughter] 

597.30 599.31 A: so do you work five days a week 

599.02 599.89 B: uh 

599.42 599.89 A: or
