70.61 71.95 A: because 

72.37 73.49 A: um 

74.29 87.66 A: you can start small and i i thought that's the way to do it you don't wanna invest a lot of money in something you just wanna start small and if it pays off you keep on expanding and and keep going like that 

87.09 87.97 B: uh-huh 

88.07 89.18 A: so uh

102.84 105.05 A: (( a lot of people do that )) 

105.09 109.74 A: [lipsmack] and another way of is to go to bali and just buy a bunch of their batik 

110.14 112.92 A: cloth that they make there for really cheap 

112.55 113.44 B: uh-huh 

113.12 118.34 A: and their carvings and all that kind of stuff just fill up a what do you call 

120.70 124.04 A: [lipsmack] one of those containers that they send across the ocean 

123.71 124.59 B: uh-huh 

124.23 125.71 A: what do you call those things 

125.31 127.07 B: like a crate or something 

127.17 128.46 B: (( i don't know what they're )) 

127.26 133.13 A: well it's like a you can pick a like a big old crane can pick it up put it onto a truck 

132.64 135.89 B: yeah i know what you're talking about but i don't know the name of it 

133.30 134.01 A: it's 

134.29 135.01 A: yeah 

135.67 137.43 A: it's called a container i guess 

137.21 138.67 B: [laughter] 

137.59 143.48 A: well i i saw this guy at a flea market and that's what he said he said you just put an ad in the paper in bali and you say 

144.10 152.18 A: [lipsmack] you know 'i wanna start this import business and uh if you're you know reputable if you're interested um respond to the ad' and he said people would write to you 

152.39 153.40 B: wow 

153.57 155.64 A: and i was like well how do you trust them 

155.85 164.02 A: and he's like they wanna do business the you don't send 'em a lot of money basically you have to end up sending 'em some money and they send you the stuff 

163.70 164.63 B: uh-huh 

165.06 166.21 A: yeah anyway 

166.23 166.96 B: hm 

166.69 168.34 A: what about you mhm hm 

167.60 172.69 B: [lipsmack] well i have thought about um starting a tutoring business 

172.75 178.56 B: i tutor kids now but um [lipsmack] of i'm sick of having to 

179.06 182.10 B: write reports after everything i do [laughter] 

181.48 183.10 A: [sigh] yeah 

182.67 187.72 B: every tiny little aspect of my life i have to write a report about it so i can get paid for it 

187.60 188.65 A: right 

187.84 194.71 B: [lipsmack] and so i figured if i uh am doing it for myself then i don't have to write those reports anymore 

194.63 196.29 A: (( [laughter] )) 

195.87 200.98 B: so i'm i'm thinking about starting an an internet tutoring business 

201.59 203.27 B: um but 

203.99 212.08 B: my big obstacles right now are finding someone to help me figure out the software because i know absolutely zero about software 

212.86 216.79 A: well how would that work would they log onto the website and they 

216.88 218.45 A: get tutored or something 

218.38 223.32 B: yeah um actually i i work for an online tutoring company right now 

223.57 228.09 B: so a lot of w- it would probably be similar um 

228.39 239.97 B: the one i work for now um it's like a subscription service and parents and schools and libraries subscribe to the service and then um kids just log on 

240.21 244.99 B: and get tutored whenever they want about whatever subjects they want 

245.87 248.76 B: they just get hooked up with a live tutor 

249.03 253.27 B: um so i'd like to improve on that by uh 

253.91 259.36 B: you know allowing them to when they log on to hook up with a specific tutor 

258.97 260.36 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

259.77 262.96 B: so they could have like standing appointments with a tutor 

263.40 272.10 B: versus what i have right now is they just when they log on they just get a random tutor just whoever's available at the time [noise] 

263.43 264.26 A: okay 

272.36 278.69 A: i see well do they not have an option of like scheduling with a certain tutor 

273.62 274.49 B: so 

278.18 283.84 B: um not not on this particular service if they want to um 

284.02 289.30 B: go to like a a private page that's then when they pay by the hour 

289.48 296.94 B: they can get a specific tutor that way but for the whole thing that they're just subscribing to they can't 

297.13 300.79 B: they just get whoever happens to be available next 

302.57 304.83 A: (( hm hm it sounds like a freelance business )) 

305.60 306.89 B: oh the tutoring 

307.21 309.89 A: no i mean if you were gonna start your own business that way 

309.60 310.61 B: yeah 

310.38 313.49 A: could you uh make enough to support yourself do you think right 

313.08 320.73 B: oh well i'm just doing it right now just to supplement my income or supplement my husband's income so 

320.12 321.32 A: right [laughter] 

321.30 325.38 B: we're you know we'd like to make some money off of it but 

325.51 328.60 B: i'm not looking at that to support my family 

329.25 334.89 A: yeah well so to start how how could you start a business that way and then i 

335.07 338.70 A: mean you need to make enough money to make it worth your time wow 

339.19 340.13 B: yeah 

340.43 343.32 B: i yeah it would people pay 

343.79 348.81 B: people pay fifty dollars and up for tutors fifty dollars an hour and up 

348.92 356.04 B: um so you y- it you don't have to charge or you don't have to do much business to make it pay for itself 

356.26 357.06 A: (( i see hm )) 

356.66 358.10 B: [laughter] 

358.25 359.20 B: um 

359.47 363.87 B: even even now i don't have to do much for it to be worthwhile 

364.09 370.23 A: so the company that you work for they take uh part of that fifty dollars and you don't get all that right oh mhm mhm 

369.51 377.29 B: well the company i work for they're not charging fifty dollars an hour i'm just saying um you know like private tutors 

378.24 379.08 B: uh 

379.09 381.92 B: either online or actually in person 

382.82 388.15 B: uh uh around here or around the d._c. area [mn] the going rate is about fifty dollars an hour 

389.19 391.60 B: a lot charge more than that 

390.93 394.66 A: hm so it's better to do it in person or over the internet right huh yeah 

394.04 396.56 B: well even online they'd pay that much 

397.36 399.68 B: for like private appointments 

400.69 401.64 B: yeah 

402.26 404.28 B: they pay all kinds of money 

404.43 406.41 B: [laughter] 

405.56 407.52 A: sure i could see that 

407.30 408.28 B: so 

408.93 413.91 B: and so you don't have to you know you don't have to have a lot of appointments for it to start being 

414.13 415.24 B: worthwhile 

418.15 422.65 A: [lipsmack] yeah i was reading about this guy that started uh blockbuster 

422.63 423.45 B: uh-huh 

423.43 426.99 A: and uh he likes rental businesses 

427.15 428.37 A: where um 

429.33 436.59 A: you know there's an initial cash outlay and then after that you your income just continues to come in because it's a rental 

436.86 437.72 B: uh-huh 

437.21 442.31 A: so he bought like thirty percent of blockbuster when it was just nineteen stores 

442.88 452.46 A: was a chain of nineteen stores and he realized that you could never find anything in any video store there was like somebody standing behind a counter saying well i think it's over there 

444.59 445.47 B: right 

452.35 459.68 A: and so he like standardized all those shops and made them all brightly lit and you know easy to find everything 

459.01 460.74 B: made it profitable 

460.83 463.98 A: sh- oh yeah and then he sold the company for all this money i 

463.62 464.63 B: wow 

464.45 469.40 A: think it was like the third it was the third company he did like that 

468.79 469.73 B: uh-huh 

469.62 473.06 A: he started as a as a trash truck driver in 

472.94 473.77 B: (( oh [noise] )) 

473.48 474.52 A: florida 

474.93 477.43 A: and it was a rental there too because you 

477.69 487.41 A: you the trash company buys those trash cans out there those things that the people put the and then they the customer pays a rental 

488.31 490.73 A: on using the trash thing 

490.40 491.53 B: right 

491.24 495.26 A: so it's there was a similarity between that and blockbuster i thought that was interesting mhm 

494.68 498.42 B: yeah you wouldn't you wouldn't normally put those together 

498.30 502.25 A: yeah well i was trying to think what kind of a rental business could i do 

504.51 506.87 A: hm the other thing this guy did was he 

506.97 512.79 A: didn't start it from scratch he went into a business that already existed and really improved it 

512.34 513.78 B: yeah 

512.89 515.62 A: so i think that would be a a great way to do it too so how 

515.34 519.46 B: it is because there's a lot less of the start up stuff 

518.97 520.25 A: (( to do that yeah )) 

519.58 524.84 B: and it's usually easier to see how something could be better versus starting from scratch 

524.53 525.84 A: yeah 

525.38 532.02 B: i'm i'm real good at at criticizing the way things are but starting it from scratch is a little harder 

529.19 530.54 A: (( [laughter] )) 

532.16 533.67 A: (( sure hm )) 

532.81 533.82 B: [laughter] 

534.87 537.73 A: did you ever think about starting a restaurant 

537.52 538.58 B: um 

538.76 541.37 B: [lipsmack] yeah my husband was talking about that 

542.40 545.09 A: i thought that was a great way to great way to go 

542.41 543.35 B: um 

545.15 549.30 B: yeah well he he wants to start like a donut shop 

549.24 550.05 A: (( [laughter] )) 

549.38 551.53 B: a drive through donut shop 

551.67 554.01 A: ooh a drive through donut shop 

553.41 554.48 B: yeah 

555.10 555.97 B: (( you know )) 

555.82 556.85 A: okay 

556.32 558.60 B: here's here's the the theory 

558.64 561.29 B: um if you're gonna be buying donuts 

561.98 568.02 B: you're probably not looking to be like exercising and all physically fit 

567.19 570.29 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

568.09 569.00 B: (( and so )) 

569.91 575.08 B: [laughter] make it as le- a little exercise as possible to even get the donuts 

575.18 576.67 B: [laughter] 

576.23 577.44 A: yeah that's true 

578.38 581.29 A: i guess people like to sit around the donut shop though 

581.48 585.24 A: and drink coffee and have another coffee and another donut 

584.83 587.77 B: yeah yeah sometimes people do at 

587.88 590.26 B: least that's what the policeman do you know 

590.60 593.04 B: [laughter] 

590.84 591.88 A: (( hm )) 

593.46 595.71 A: i've never actually seen them doing that 

596.30 597.78 B: [sigh] me neither 

597.67 599.89 A: yeah i go into donut shops and i don't see 'em there
