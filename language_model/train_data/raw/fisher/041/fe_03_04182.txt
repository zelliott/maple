82.83 83.64 A: (( i think ))

89.91 91.46 B: oh that's very nice 

91.54 93.10 A: and uh 

94.03 97.90 A: dealing primarily with the pre teens and teenagers 

97.55 98.37 B: mm 

98.13 102.08 A: because like in wyoming there is not really anything for them to do 

102.50 106.35 A: you know if they're latchkey kids um 

102.70 104.51 B: yeah i see what you're saying 

106.82 113.48 A: we don't have like y._m._c._a.s and girls' and boys' clubs and this and that 

111.53 112.88 B: really 

113.66 115.48 A: and so uh 

115.96 117.77 A: yeah uh 

116.72 118.17 B: oh wow 

118.07 120.32 A: like the area i'm in 

120.60 129.32 A: well my town is less than four hundred and then landers only like six thousand [laughter] and 

128.01 130.48 B: oh so it's really small where you are 

130.33 137.61 A: riverton is nine thousand and that's it you know you're in a in a forty mile 

137.66 139.27 A: one way distance 

139.60 145.05 B: do you have a lot of problems um with um teens you know getting into trouble there 

146.53 148.52 B: or no is it more like boredom 

146.71 147.90 A: (( um )) 

150.08 153.10 A: [mn] uh the boredom leads to problems 

153.29 154.32 A: (( you know )) 

153.82 155.39 B: yeah i agree i agree 

154.80 158.76 A: if you don't have anything to do what are you gonna do but get in trouble 

158.35 163.44 B: well yeah no that's why new york has so many we have a lot of programs because 

163.58 170.06 B: you know they have the the police athletic league you know there's there's millions and millions of them there's just so many 

170.60 175.16 B: um i think we're so also supposed to talk about how we would go about it um 

170.86 171.71 A: and 

176.19 181.72 B: how we would go about doing this um i guess what i would do is like i'm going to school 

182.15 186.74 B: um after going to school i would probably um 

187.36 188.88 B: i guess uh 

189.01 196.42 B: i would know then what to do i i guess i would in- get my money and you know buy supplies and just start i guess 

196.61 201.12 B: i mean uh i've thought about doing catering now by myself without even going to school 

201.32 202.26 B: but 

202.32 208.97 B: i'm um actually waiting for a kidney transplant so i'm not really equipped right now to take on 

209.34 211.29 B: i could be called any minute so 

212.03 214.64 B: i have to wait until i'm all done 

216.12 218.77 A: i think i would contact uh 

218.96 223.96 A: various uh law enforcement types you know the county attorney and 

224.01 230.24 A: uh the two major political parties and the churches and these types of things 

230.68 232.90 A: and tell 'em what i wanted to do 

233.15 242.03 A: and get them basically to give me feedback and quote unquote marketing research you know as to how many and so on and so forth 

242.49 254.58 A: and then try and set up a place that would have just vending machines you know like the fruit and the juice and the chips and all that as opposed to 

254.64 256.51 A: like fast food or something 

256.18 257.09 B: right 

257.19 259.90 A: and put in a bunch of computers 

259.77 262.08 B: oh yeah 

261.23 262.83 A: and 

262.97 268.76 A: then some games you know like darts and pool tables and [sigh] stuff like that

270.19 272.18 A: (( and )) 

272.95 273.77 A: (( try to )) 

276.45 281.97 B: well that sounds really wonderful did you really ever think about doing that even if you don't have all the money in the world [laughter]

389.31 391.00 A: uh yeah 

390.62 391.99 B: oh yeah i thought so 

393.30 397.18 B: i was looking for some place to go on vacation but i guess wyoming's not it 

393.70 394.87 A: but uh 

398.36 399.62 A: well there's 

399.86 401.43 A: you know places 

403.09 405.18 A: like that where you can 

410.23 411.88 B: i love to see the country 

414.97 416.63 B: i would have you ever been to new york 

421.64 422.49 B: hello 

424.14 425.76 A: every week either 

426.16 427.13 A: (( you know )) 

429.01 429.95 A: (( so uh )) 

431.59 435.32 B: you know what i'm having a really hard time hearing you you're going in and out 

435.64 437.01 A: oh really 

436.38 437.94 B: yeah 

437.76 440.09 A: you kinda faded out on me 

439.61 442.66 B: yeah you too a minute ago oh it's a little bit better now 

443.79 444.38 A: (( hm )) 

444.27 447.37 B: of course now that we're t- we're not talking about anything specific 

447.96 449.92 B: i don't know what else we're supposed to talk about 

448.27 449.18 A: but 

450.88 459.90 A: i think i'd try to get you know donations from the community i'd try to get like maybe corporate sponsorship you know like maybe minute maid or something 

457.37 458.61 B: absolutely 

459.73 462.83 B: i i my husband and i ran a fundraiser 

462.94 469.34 B: for um a policeman that was killed in the line of duty and we ran a fundraiser for his family 

469.39 480.57 B: and forget it it was all donations from politicians and local business owners and to have advertising and you know that's basically what you would have to do 

481.01 488.48 B: if you got all all the um information from the local businessmen that you know it looks good for them too it's a write off 

489.65 490.52 B: so they 

489.78 497.76 A: well we don't have all that much business but that's why i was thinking more like minute maid and you know the big corporate sponsors 

495.00 496.15 B: (( oh yeah )) 

497.17 499.50 B: right well i'm sure that would be good 

499.49 501.96 A: and try to get some grants 

499.52 500.08 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

503.43 506.44 B: i'm sure you could get something especially if there's nothing there 

507.57 515.19 A: and then i it would be a matter of finding a actual location you know building and all that 

513.99 515.81 B: big enough right 

516.69 518.41 A: actual machines 

519.00 520.31 B: right well 

521.46 525.02 B: catering a lot of people do catering in my um 

525.16 525.72 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

526.50 528.66 B: in my part of um 

528.97 532.05 B: the country um right from their homes 

532.14 545.27 B: you can do um you could do a certain degree from your home and then when you do a larger scale you need to find um you have to have a separate area though that's that's the hard part like usually if you have a basement or um 

545.28 548.76 B: a separate area to do the work in you can but 

549.93 553.74 B: it's uh it's a little bit harder when you wanna do a large scale 

554.18 559.16 B: um [lipsmack] i think i would probably wanna work for a caterer first 

559.57 562.81 B: so that i could get the ins and outs 

563.04 571.09 B: even before i go to school i real- i would like to work for a caterer but like like i said my situation it's very hard for me to make any type of commitment 

571.35 572.28 B: so 

573.43 575.78 B: that's about it i i don't it's 

575.56 577.72 A: (( yeah and i'm )) 

576.03 579.46 B: i talk about it like it's no big deal because i just i'm always cooking 

579.51 583.26 B: i'm always doing a lot my husband's work 

583.38 587.39 B: being a policeman they're always like they're always working on holidays 

587.40 588.33 A: (( uh-huh )) 

587.73 591.23 B: every thanksgiving i cook a full dinner for them 

591.57 592.99 B: and bring it to them 

593.29 599.48 B: to have at their work so that the guys that are working on thanksgiving and can't be with their families they can all have thanksgiving together
