72.20 72.83 A: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

76.80 77.83 A: mhm 

77.78 78.59 B: mm

83.18 87.62 B: mm actually it would be cancer or addiction 

87.78 95.44 B: uh research on how to get people to uh [sigh] uh stop being addicted [laughter] 

94.38 98.54 A: [mn] [laughter] yeah it's 

98.78 104.35 A: kinda hard to get your thoughts together when you're caught a little off guard [laughter] 

102.86 106.44 B: [sigh] yeah they kind of yeah exactly i 

106.66 110.38 B: i've thought about opening a business how 'bout how 'bout yourself 

109.98 118.57 A: [mn] oh i did have my own business i ran a resume business for quite some time and it was really nice because i could help people find jobs 

118.66 131.84 A: and um sometimes they came to me and they had no clue as to why they weren't being able to find a job and i'd look at the resume that they'd done for themselves and oops the answer was real quick [laughter] 

131.18 139.78 B: yeah i'd actually i've i've had problems with uh uh doing uh resumes i'm i'm really good at at what i do but 

139.74 148.58 B: um being so many years in the area in the business when it comes to actually uh doing a resume i'm not very good at it 

144.27 145.35 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

148.83 156.36 A: well you know most people when they go to do a resume for themselves don't think of the things that 

148.94 149.85 B: (( you know )) 

156.65 159.81 A: they did at work that would look good on a resume 

160.11 161.06 A: (( like )) 

160.19 161.87 B: yeah you're right 

161.16 164.89 A: like for example if you were a sales girl 

165.09 176.07 A: uh it might be that that you you know had to tell the customers about the product and educate them about the product and and maybe order new products if you were getting low on stuff 

176.13 183.86 A: and most people will think oh well all i did was sell stuff and i didn't do very much you know when they really did 

183.93 185.83 B: yeah that was my problem 

184.13 186.29 A: they had to have a lot of skills 

185.84 192.16 B: that yeah that was my problem i've i've had so many years of education and and so many things i've done 

192.19 198.64 B: so basically i couldn't get the first interview but once i got the first interview i i got the job immediately 

198.21 207.48 A: [mn] [mn] yeah [noise] yeah that's the way it is with a lot of people and um but then of course there's the people that don't know how to interview and wouldn't interview 

207.62 208.64 A: well 

208.66 214.01 A: you know even if they had the best resume in the world and so some people have to be taught how to interview 

214.42 217.12 B: wow okay that's that's interesting 

214.92 215.48 A: (( [mn] )) 

217.39 218.74 A: but uh 

219.20 221.79 A: well they're usually the people that are like 

222.10 227.51 A: uh you know they're asked a question they give a real short answer like yes or no or 

227.62 232.74 A: whatever and you can't get information out of them easily and an interviewer likes to interview somebody that can 

232.82 234.83 A: give 'em a lot of information 

235.16 239.64 B: and and what kind of int- uh what kind of resumes did you do what kind of uh 

239.11 242.16 A: oh depending upon what the person did i 

242.43 245.19 A: did the type of resume that they needed 

244.41 246.03 B: (( oh well that's interesting )) 

245.72 246.84 A: so 

247.26 250.82 A: uh sometimes if a person had been out of work for a while 

250.29 251.54 B: mhm 

250.93 254.40 A: like maybe they'd they'd stayed home to raise their kids or something 

254.11 255.19 B: mhm 

254.57 261.87 A: you would do a skills resume that would list their skills and stuff and not necessarily do a chronological resume so 

261.98 262.92 B: mhm 

262.32 263.55 A: it was fun 

264.02 264.75 B: mm 

264.59 265.64 A: it was fun 

266.19 267.57 A: and i liked it 

266.31 274.41 B: yeah i have had experience with that lately well i had it before but now i'm like working like a dog and i enjoy my job 

270.11 270.74 A: (( [sigh] )) 

274.24 275.27 A: uh-huh 

275.76 279.89 A: well yeah and i think it's important for people to enjoy what they do 

279.97 281.53 A: i mean it's [sigh] 

281.89 285.56 A: not very much fun uh doing something 

285.59 292.51 A: at least eight hours a day if you're doing it for yourself as your own business if you don't enjoy it you're gonna be miserable 

292.44 296.15 B: well it's kinda interesting because we we're allowed to uh 

296.18 303.20 B: kind of my job is my own business in a way because um i'm i'm a clinical liaison for a uh pharmaceutical 

301.89 302.45 A: (( [mn] )) 

302.87 303.80 A: uh-huh 

303.40 313.63 B: and i have a a an an m. d. background so basically i'm just speaking to doctors about medicine all day long so it's what i enjoy doing 

307.07 308.00 A: uh-huh 

313.45 319.42 A: yeah yeah and if you've got a job that that where you really enjoy doing something you 

319.61 325.39 A: probably wouldn't necessarily wanna rush into opening up your own business but uh if you 

325.66 333.60 A: you know if you've got a job that you don't like and you've got a business that you think that you could do that you would like yeah i'd switch 

333.91 334.97 A: but 

335.11 336.21 A: (( it's kind of )) 

335.21 338.58 B: well couldn't you have your cake and eat it too in a way like 

338.15 340.00 A: pardon i i can't 

338.84 341.09 B: couldn't you have your cake and eat it too 

341.09 343.70 A: yeah i think sometimes you can 

344.02 350.69 A: if you get a business running well enough you can take your vacations and go where you want and come back and run your business [mn] 

350.01 353.53 B: mm that's true that's that's gonna be difficult i see your point 

353.78 355.03 A: (( so )) 

355.29 356.84 A: (( can be a lot of fun )) 

358.19 364.89 B: it's uh when you run your own business that's that's a good point that you make you don't have much free time to do 

364.73 373.35 A: well not only that you don't necessarily have a lot of free time but you've got a lot more responsibility than if you just had a regular job because 

373.40 376.34 A: the money doesn't come in unless you bring it in 

376.69 381.14 A: it's not like a regular job where you got that paycheck every week that you can count on 

381.29 382.96 A: sometimes the uh 

383.42 386.38 A: [mn] money flow goes up and it goes down 

386.99 389.46 A: and when it goes down it's not much fun 

390.01 402.50 B: i don't know i i guess because of the the jobs that i've had they're so stressful and there's so much responsibility you're responsible for everything that i guess it [mn] having your own business kinda like [sigh] 

398.59 399.53 A: mhm 

402.49 405.56 B: i don't know maybe i'm wrong but it's like a breather for me 

405.40 406.82 A: mhm 

406.10 412.92 B: because it's like um there's so much responsibilities for patients and and everything else 

411.00 412.01 A: (( mhm )) 

412.63 413.52 A: mhm 

413.44 415.63 B: i don't know maybe it would be easier [laughter] 

415.88 416.68 B: i 

415.90 417.22 A: right 

418.23 426.13 B: uh i and and it's just so competitive out there you you do have a point i mean it's competitive it's [mn] 

425.44 427.10 A: yeah 

426.50 429.93 B: starting off your business and you're not only you're in the market 

429.67 438.35 A: i mean it's like why open up a gas station if there's three of 'em on the other three corners of of the street [laughter] you know um you have to [sigh] 

435.24 437.39 B: right right yeah 

438.67 447.51 A: find your niche and you have to be able to have the expertise to run it and you gotta be able to raise the funding to open the business and so 

447.74 455.70 A: each step takes time and it takes work and you don't get paid for all that planning on opening a business 

455.89 458.31 A: uh and that does take your time 

458.38 458.94 A: (( [mn] )) 

458.81 463.41 B: okay well how 'bout if you did it while you were working at a at a job 

462.82 468.93 A: you can do that if you was gonna open up the right type of business where you can do your planning and secure your funding and 

469.01 472.43 A: start the business maybe on a part time basis and then 

472.54 476.76 A: be able to leave your full time job after a while but uh 

477.87 480.41 A: you know you you do a lot of groundwork 

480.76 483.99 A: because if you don't do it you don't have a successful business anyway 

484.10 486.98 A: and you don't ge- necessarily get paid for that 

487.23 494.79 B: and what do you how 'bout tax wise that's the thing that concerns me all these tax loopholes and stuff and you have to pay double tax 

492.53 494.70 A: [sigh] well you have to have a good uh 

494.77 503.00 A: you have to have a good tax adviser a good tax accountant especially if you're if you're running a business and good tax software 

503.09 507.64 A: so you can make sure that that you record all your income and outgo 

507.73 510.83 A: so you get figure out what your net income is 

510.89 521.78 B: well that that's what i i did do something like that i bought the uh actually through a ebay thing [laughter] i bought one of those uh home and business softwares 

516.67 517.67 A: mhm 

521.16 522.46 A: mhm 

522.12 523.18 B: and 

523.28 528.98 B: it's it takes a lot of time to d- input everything in it's not easy i can tell you that 

527.68 528.59 A: (( no )) 

529.23 530.11 A: no 

530.14 531.88 A: and you know you can 

532.04 537.62 A: there's a lot of ways to go in terms of opening up your own business but it all takes work [mn] [mn] 

537.81 546.42 B: yeah you're right and and it's not like if you're gonna do overtime on your business you're gonna get overtime or anything like that so it kinda like you're a slave to it 

545.79 546.94 A: mhm 

547.51 550.41 A: yeah you either own the business or it owns you 

550.08 551.86 B: yes that's my problem 

551.43 552.77 A: [laughter] 

552.95 553.76 B: but 

552.97 553.86 A: (( yeah that's )) 

554.03 567.07 B: it is and it's difficult because [sigh] the personality is so is you have to have the right personality because if you can't juggle it you you've made an excellent point it your business owns you you don't own the business 

566.71 572.34 A: well not only that if you've gotta have the right personality to deal with people because 

572.74 577.44 A: if you're not [sigh] the kind of person that enjoys dealing with people 

577.49 581.76 A: not only customers but vendors that you buy stuff from and so on 

581.87 586.17 A: it'll it'll be more difficult if the customers don't like you they're not gonna come back 

585.55 586.60 B: that's true 

586.64 587.75 A: so 

588.64 590.14 A: that's just kinda 

590.65 592.31 A: how that goes 

590.74 591.72 B: and 

592.00 599.95 B: and like you said also the vendors because uh you get [sigh] i mean dealing simple little things like fedex doesn't mean
