50.15 56.56 A: because i i didn't do that enough and and when i st- i caught onto it a little late do 

56.70 66.59 A: you know what i mean just the way people act and and just even like going to their office and seeing how they conduct themselves over the phone just do you know what i mean because th- th- these 

65.56 67.12 B: yeah yeah yeah 

66.78 72.42 A: people obviously did it the right way and and i caught onto that just a little late and you know 

72.46 73.50 A: um 

72.87 81.40 B: yeah i i think for you know for me i just w- if i was going to open uh i mean i i kinda do r- i'm a musician and i i run my own 

81.32 95.66 B: business but if i could open like a whole uh i have a pr- like a production company but if i could really do anything i would probably miss the whole um like a it's like a studio for uh for films

122.36 123.42 B: yeah 

127.70 139.33 A: uh i i to to get a lot of different advice a lot like [mn] like go to older people because they've been around and then go to to younger people and you know what i mean and don't discount anything and 

137.25 150.76 B: yeah and i think i think there's always a plan like [mn] for whatever you do if you study what's been successful and how they work it then at least utilize those things as a mold and then adapt like slightly to what your specific 

149.98 163.86 A: what your style is i mean i remember when i started my my boss was like okay no no no she goes you know um uh people like me because i'm funny and you know and and you should do this and well uh they didn't really think she was funny first of all and she was obnoxious 

163.68 175.58 A: but i developed my own style and it worked you know and and it worked and and i wasn't being a phoney and and that was kind of important you know so you gotta develop your own style with people and y- you know 

164.10 165.68 B: [laughter] 

167.12 168.68 B: yeah yeah 

172.51 173.41 B: yeah

177.20 188.51 A: oh oh a niche oh god it's like i would tell actors you know you've got to find a niche and they would say oh but i'm an actor and i don't wanna be typecast i'm like well yeah but you're waiting tables now so what you know 

179.70 180.64 B: (( [mn] you know ))

196.07 199.66 A: okay and i know kelsey grammar in a very strange way 

199.45 212.47 A: or he thinks he thinks he knows me and when it's a kind of a weird s- i've see- i've had i went to a taping with a client that used to go out with him and he hugged me in front of the audience and he was like how great to see you merrin come up to my office 

212.36 224.23 A: we were like oh you know they treated me with such respect on the stage like i knew kelsey and i was like and i'm not going to embarrass him like i'm like who the hell are y- you know you you you know and 

218.90 220.08 B: (( uh-huh right )) 

222.65 225.57 B: yeah exactly [laughter]

228.12 240.16 A: i me- and he was in a bathrobe and berkinstocks i'll never forget that bathrobe and berkinstocks and he's a wonderful wonderful kind man and i i w- you know lotta 

232.83 234.05 B: (( wow mhm )) 

240.28 251.28 A: not ego and you know what i mean and this guy it's a business so we're talking about the business he has set up a business and he knows that he is frasier crane he knows that this is his career you know 

251.19 264.62 A: and he's you know unfortunately i think the show should stop well it should've stopped last year it's got one more year and it's gonna go off dead is what's happening the ratings are so pathetic but he knows it's a business and he knows what to sell you know what i mean 

251.45 252.76 B: (( mhm mm )) 

263.92 266.20 B: he he's he's comfortable with that you know 

265.44 275.61 A: he is selling himself and he has made tons of money and that's okay he knows the product he knows the market you know he knows his worth and he knows that so he's smart you know 

267.28 267.92 B: (( mhm )) 

269.35 270.56 B: yeah 

275.58 276.75 B: mhm 

276.00 286.87 A: you know and and so [mn] you know it's okay to it's it's you need to be specialized like a doctor needs to be specialized you can't just be open anymore you know what i mean 

284.40 285.21 B: mhm 

286.61 293.05 B: yeah you won't you won't make it there's just too much competition and uh everything's been done you know i think as far as 

291.69 295.67 A: yeah it's just it's just yeah you gotta find the different thing whether it's 

295.49 309.83 A: you know it's specializing in the urban market specializing in the hispanic market you know i would certainly go where there's money and i would certainly go to if i was going to appeal to a certain ethnicity or something um which is basically what is 

302.68 303.48 B: mhm 

309.83 319.63 A: what is go- is what madison avenue does obviously with telemundo and all these other stations you know you know they find that there is buying power and it's all about buying power 

315.34 316.30 B: yeah 

319.60 326.23 A: and setting up it's all it's all like you wanna get you're with a seller and you need to get a client so you know i mean and 

319.61 320.59 B: yeah 

324.72 328.03 B: so you're you're not you're not in the acting business anymore then 

327.41 336.15 A: no i got out of it but you need to really work these people and you you know whether it's called kissing ass or whether it's taking them to lunch or whether it's giving them 

328.77 329.71 B: okay 

336.17 341.07 A: you know gifts that you probably can't afford then unfortunately you have to do it 

340.90 341.88 B: mhm 

341.30 346.64 A: and if i was giving advice hypothetically again i would i would say 

346.77 353.87 A: to m- plan that you're not going to make really money for the first year or two unless you're really unless you're doing like um 

354.04 368.05 A: i don't know if you know when they have these tornadoes and then you know they have these people that appear at the the tornado site a- an hour later helping people well then you're going to get money immediately but in my business or your business or in most businesses it's you have to lay out money if 

361.63 362.98 B: yeah yeah 

365.51 366.61 B: yeah 

367.90 369.46 A: if you're gonna open up 

368.24 373.85 B: and you have to plan that you have to plan on laying out lots of money man like uh just don't yeah yeah 

371.58 376.17 A: yeah oh yeah and you have to take sacrifices in your personal life 

376.16 378.52 B: yeah that's not the only part 

376.53 387.33 A: you know and you really do and you know you got to decide well you know it's like i was working sixty seventy hours a week and you know that's that was my life and that was okay and i loved it and uh you know but 

387.35 391.25 A: y- you have it has to be your passion i mean 

390.77 391.89 B: yeah 

391.30 393.93 A: it just you know and and 

393.17 394.93 B: oh i hear that yeah 

394.12 400.27 A: don't be like i did and very stupidly listen to my father when he said 

400.71 405.81 A: don't get a small business loan and at that time i had i had very good credit at that time 

405.69 417.68 A: [sigh] because i had not i was involved in a partnership where i was i was making money and i had really good credit and they were giving me more and more credit cards more and more credit and i could've gotten a small business loan i i mean i didn't 

410.62 411.47 B: yeah 

417.46 428.07 A: own a car i was paying it off i didn't own a house but you know what i mean i could've gotten it and he said don't do it and i was stupid and i should've asked financial advisors 

421.57 422.41 B: mhm 

428.24 440.61 A: you know what i mean and i would say that's why uh i uh hypothetically and i keep saying that because i know it's what they want i would say go to financial people if you have financial questions don't go to your mother you know what i mean 

428.49 429.54 B: yeah 

438.63 447.44 B: i i think yeah i i think there i think it's the biggest [mn] thing with everybody is nobody plans on putting enough money into the business plan then and then 

446.27 449.33 A: exactly i mean i had 

450.03 451.92 A: i just couldn't okay 

452.03 462.74 A: okay let's just take a business phone bill well people don't get it unless you're in business that every time you pick up that phone in a business phone [sigh] it costs you money 

462.91 464.21 B: yeah 

463.55 469.42 A: you know it's not like um a home phone where you can make nine thousand calls and you get and they don't charge [mn] 

469.31 479.77 A: every time it's like and it's not cheap and i remember getting my first you know i remember them installing the phone in my office and i got two lines and a fax line i didn't even have the computer 

478.64 479.56 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

479.93 485.34 A: it was like two hundred and seventy dollars to install the phone because they charge you on the quarter of an hour 

485.44 486.78 B: wow yeah 

485.61 496.11 A: then you gotta put money down on it and then uh i had to buy a fax machine then i had to buy a t._b._b. cell for the office then i had to buy artwork because you you know you need to give off the impression that you're successful 

495.76 498.24 B: exactly yeah mhm 

496.01 503.70 A: in any business in our business in if you're trying to become a realtor if you're going to be a plumber i mean you have to give off 

502.77 510.77 B: people need to feel co- people need to see co- feel confidence when they order you whether you're six days old or or six years old they gotta feel that confidence 

509.12 512.41 A: oh yeah i mean i don't want to associate with a loser 

512.59 513.40 B: yeah 

512.72 514.44 A: (( i mean who does you know )) 

514.19 515.16 B: mhm

520.56 523.31 B: yeah [laughter] yeah 

521.61 528.28 A: you know it's not and it's it's not being it is you know at first i thought it was kinda being a phoney and stuff but it's 

523.70 524.71 B: yeah 

528.50 539.64 A: it's not it's not every business every business is the same you have to plan on it you have to put money away you have to prepare that you're not gonna make money you have to prepare to put money into it 

539.65 541.06 A: and you have to 

539.97 550.23 B: and having those [mn] like you said putting money away is it is a big thing like that not just putting the numbers you have to have a a slush fund of uh for contingencies and might happen and you know 

543.03 544.50 A: yeah 

548.80 556.52 A: [sigh] exactly i mean you have to have maybe nice par- i mean i didn't you know what you have to do something it's like you know you it's it's 

556.65 565.41 A: either y- i can't explain you either have to have a passion or not i have an opportunity to buy a tanning salon um with my brother 

560.93 561.82 B: yeah 

565.52 566.65 B: (( okay that )) 

565.71 566.63 A: (( and [mn] )) 

566.72 576.09 A: uh another thing is and hypothetically maybe think about before you go into business with a sibling you know we didn't do it but it's 

576.29 580.14 A: y- i didn't do it because i knew it was going to be trouble you know 

576.98 579.28 B: (( could be u- that could be ugly )) 

579.64 580.69 B: yeah 

580.24 583.03 A: yeah so you have to really trust 

583.16 594.31 A: your business partner and always always get two people to sign the checks never never should a check just be able to be signed by one partner 

594.37 595.50 B: yeah
