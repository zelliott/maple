0.40 1.77 A: (( irene )) 

1.70 3.42 B: hi i'm shaun 

3.47 4.71 A: hi shaun 

4.58 5.91 B: hi irene 

5.47 7.07 A: [laughter] how are you 

6.77 8.37 B: good how are you 

8.21 9.44 A: (( good [sigh] )) 

9.24 14.33 B: um well i'm in the process of starting my own business 

14.56 24.61 B: so this is kind of an easy question for me um i started a website and i'm going to be selling children's toys 

14.89 16.72 A: [noise] oh gosh 

24.27 25.28 A: [laughter] 

25.00 36.02 B: so i've been in communication with um two companies brio and uh learning curve they make thomas the tank engine and bob the builder toys [mn] 

35.68 40.08 A: it sounds very interesting and you have unlimited resources [laughter] like they said 

39.20 44.49 B: no i don't have unlimited resources but uh it's not that expensive um 

44.52 45.08 B: (( [noise] )) 

45.28 50.27 B: just a second i'm actually playing trivia right now too [laughter] 

47.84 58.95 A: [sigh] [laughter] yeah that you know i guess if i had unlimited resources i would start some kind of a food business i would probably go for some 

59.14 61.39 A: something sweet like some ice cream 

61.26 63.88 B: oh that sounds great like a ben and jerry's 

63.28 71.07 A: yes i think it would it would bring even more profit because people will always want to have some kind of sweet thing and 

70.32 71.63 B: right 

71.52 74.63 A: you know with unlimited resources you can really um 

75.39 78.11 A: (( [lipsmack] kick the advertisement up mhm )) 

77.55 85.60 B: yeah i think the you know the only difference between you know what i'm doing now versus having unlimited resources 

85.61 86.69 B: um 

86.65 100.85 B: obviously i'd have other people working for me you know because right now i'm designing the website myself and i'm you know doing the communication and i have to get the business licenses and it's just a lot to do all at once 

89.07 90.08 A: yeah 

100.64 102.51 A: mhm yeah when did you start it 

102.64 114.06 B: um i've been doing it for about the past two months um but since then i you know before that i've sold on ebay for the past two years 

113.45 114.31 A: uh-huh 

114.23 118.13 B: and uh i'm actually an attorney but i'm staying home with my son 

118.52 121.66 B: so this is kind of what i'm doing to be home with the baby 

121.22 122.27 A: uh-huh 

121.91 128.83 B: [laughter] so so i got used to selling things over the internet through ebay 'cause that's really easy i don't know if you know that 

122.63 124.57 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

128.55 131.47 A: yeah i kinda heard of that 

131.42 142.30 B: it's neat if you like to buy things you know cheap ebay's a great place to go look for whatever you you know you want [laughter] it's it's there and you can probably get a good deal on it [laughter] 

141.37 145.97 A: [laughter] yeah but also you need you need a fast [mn] internet connection 

146.18 159.16 B: actually you know um i don't have that i i live um you know in silicon valley so uh you know everyone here has the cable modem and everything [sigh] um i actually uh 

152.34 153.14 A: uh-huh 

159.40 162.29 B: [mn] just did it with dial up so 

161.89 163.06 A: oh really 

162.45 163.86 B: mhm 

163.17 164.84 A: wow good for you 

164.62 171.25 B: yeah so it's not it's not that hard i mean i do have cable modem now but uh you know you can uh you know 

171.46 174.58 B: have fun with ebay you know with just dial up 

174.72 176.38 A: yeah i guess so 

176.12 181.05 B: yeah what kind of um so you would go for ice cream you think and 

179.52 180.27 A: [mn] 

180.46 187.60 A: yeah i think i would probably go for ice cream or some kind of chocolate desserts of some sort [sigh] 

187.30 192.86 B: mm a chocolate dessert would be a neat idea because i've never seen anything like that 

188.05 188.94 A: so 

191.98 197.68 A: yeah you know like i was born in russia and i grew up like eating european chocolate obviously 

197.84 203.64 A: and then when i came to the states i was slightly disappointed on like hershey's and all those kind of things 

203.89 205.11 B: mhm 

204.73 212.28 A: so i think everybody would benefit from something that would be yeah and it would be 

207.89 210.87 B: from some good european type chocolate here 

212.58 225.54 A: all over the billboards on times square and everywhere and it would cost pennies because i've got unlimited resources and so i would give it away [laughter] just for the hell of it [laughter] 

214.92 217.31 B: [laughter] 

221.05 223.23 B: right [laughter] 

224.17 227.97 B: that's a great idea [laughter] 

226.21 229.73 A: [laughter] yeah what what else did they want to know 

229.77 230.84 B: um i 

229.87 231.41 A: (( do you remember )) 

230.87 235.80 B: i don't rem- i think it was you know what kind of business would you start 

236.25 242.01 B: [sigh] um if you had unlimited resources there was one other thing um 

242.36 245.82 A: maybe like how how you [laughter] would you go about it 

245.78 248.75 B: yeah and i [sigh] hm 

248.49 253.32 A: [noise] i don't remember but i guess i would just start with giving things away 

253.50 257.54 A: in mass con- massive quantities yeah 

255.47 265.21 B: right that's always worked that's always worked for me you know like if there's a new business and they offer something free then i'm so much more likely to go back there 

258.90 260.01 A: yeah 

264.75 269.11 A: yeah sure i think it it's kind of a formula for every business 

268.67 283.23 B: yeah but a lot of people don't do it i mean you know i've seen [sigh] especially you know like restaurants and stuff that open up and if they don't send out coupons they fail so fast you know you need to bring do something to bring people in or make them aware of your product 

282.52 284.04 A: yeah sure 

283.68 291.08 B: through advertising you know and of course there's always word of mouth but that just takes a lot longer if you have a business 

290.85 292.74 A: (( yeah absolutely )) 

291.56 301.46 B: you know i think i think advertising is a great idea and you know i've been to times square and it [laughter] those billboards are huge [laughter] 

294.48 295.83 A: yeah also 

297.54 300.36 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

300.51 304.39 A: yeah i guess it's harder to do it in large cities 

304.30 308.00 B: yes i think so where are you um located 

307.37 308.96 A: uh i'm in new york 

308.70 309.99 B: are you oh 

309.10 313.15 A: yeah that's [laughter] that's why the times square is the first thing that pops up 

312.25 323.84 B: yeah i was just there i have a friend who uh [sigh] um had a off sh- off broadway show that opened um yeah it's called zanadone and it's really good 

319.73 322.03 A: and oh really wow 

323.55 324.99 A: (( oh wow mhm )) 

324.25 330.47 B: and it's it's it's right it's right there right now um at the john houseman theater so we went for the premiere of that 

330.48 342.43 B: and i'm hoping that it'll be a huge hit and [sigh] you know big like cats [laughter] so that was pretty neat so we were just there um a month ago and it was pretty nice weather even 

335.34 336.58 A: (( [laughter] )) 

342.43 347.23 A: [sigh] yeah a month ago it was much nicer than it is now [laughter] 

344.93 349.24 B: oh really [laughter] 

348.23 354.02 A: yeah it's cold and unfriendly and it's like not nice not nice at all 

352.26 356.08 B: yeah so how did you hear about this study that they're doing 

356.10 359.47 A: oh you know i heard it i think from craig's list 

358.91 360.63 B: yeah that's where i did 

360.04 361.45 A: yeah 

360.93 362.59 B: i love craig's list 

361.99 363.47 A: oh me too 

363.10 370.59 B: yeah it [laughter] it it's fantastic i mean i've given stuff away i've gotten free stuff uh [mn] 

364.27 365.45 A: me too 

369.93 373.49 A: yeah i got connected with some really funny people there 

373.12 380.74 B: oh that's neat i yeah i didn't i'm married so i you know don't really hang out on that part but you've met some cool people 

373.82 375.79 A: to do really interesting things 

376.31 377.18 A: mhm 

380.22 386.00 A: well i mean you know professionally not [laughter] not like to hang out [laughter] yeah 

382.85 390.80 B: oh that's good well yeah i know they have like you know like you know you can meet someone if you wanted to date or you know just do something with someone 

390.81 392.49 B: activity wise 

391.93 395.19 A: yeah i guess so but i've never investigated those 

394.94 400.61 B: yeah i just uh um i basically you know hang out and try to find stuff to buy 

400.33 401.48 A: [laughter] 

401.13 405.58 B: [laughter] you know because i sell stuff so you know it's been great for me 

404.98 406.25 A: mhm 

405.84 410.45 B: you know and then i saw this and i thought well this is fun i like to talk to people and 

409.77 412.21 A: yeah so what kind of toys are you selling 

412.13 424.03 B: um well they're thomas the tank engine is the big one and it's gonna be um [sigh] you know like the little railroad it's like you know the railroads that kids play on wooden railroads [lipsmack] 

424.38 438.50 B: and uh um like curious george toys bob the builder um yeah [mn] it's just uh they're really both companies make really good quality toys that are actually pretty expensive 

427.77 428.76 A: uh-huh 

429.96 431.46 A: [laughter] 

437.93 438.83 A: (( mhm )) 

438.58 451.64 B: you know for just like the little tiny train that's just a couple inches long um it has magnets on it so you can attach the other trains you know but just that little wooden toy is like usually like twelve dollars 

447.12 447.96 A: uh-huh 

451.60 452.59 A: (( [lipsmack] [sigh] )) 

452.10 454.93 B: you know which is a lot i think for kids' toys 

452.62 454.05 A: (( gosh )) 

454.50 456.73 A: it is a lot it is 

455.32 464.16 B: you know and it's like and then of course to get the whole thomas set you know which most you know the kids want and don't get but if you got the whole thing it's like 

464.20 467.41 B: [sigh] um i think three hundred and fifty dollars 

467.03 468.54 A: oh my god mhm 

468.11 473.87 B: yeah so that's you know one reason i thought well maybe i'll sell that because i live in a very 

473.72 486.37 B: expensive area um you know people have that kind of money and they wanna spend it on their kids and [sigh] you know i thought it'd be a great way to start so but you know to begin with i'm doing it 

486.20 490.28 B: on a website rather than um doing it on a um 

490.74 500.59 B: [sigh] you know actually doing it as a as a brick and mortar store you know like going out and renting a store and all of that i mean that that's what i would do with unlimited funds 

500.64 504.02 A: mhm yeah that would be really really time consuming too 

503.20 506.63 B: [noise] yeah it it is it it's taking a lot of time 

506.73 507.29 B: (( [noise] )) 

506.87 508.29 A: yeah 

508.22 520.56 B: yeah this is hard to do i shouldn't um play trivia while [laughter] i'm on the i'm i'm actually on the computer in the middle of a trivia game when i got the call and [laughter] and it's an easy game but it's like 

511.71 513.19 A: [laughter] 

517.75 518.97 A: [laughter] 

520.42 527.28 B: [laughter] they're probably like what are you doing why aren't you talking [laughter]

549.68 552.96 A: [sigh] you know i'm not even sure what the rules are 

552.35 557.78 B: yeah i think i think they said like three calls and then they might select you to participate further 

557.66 558.43 A: hm 

558.37 562.61 B: you know so it'd be kind of interesting i'm sure someone's doing this as a graduate uh 

562.71 563.83 B: (( [noise] you know )) 

563.94 565.72 B: thesis or something 

565.67 569.94 A: yeah those kind of experiments are very interesting i find them very fascinating
