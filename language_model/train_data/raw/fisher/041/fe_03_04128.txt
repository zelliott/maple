473.43 474.36 B: right 

476.81 488.47 A: i think with a business you really have to know that you know that you know that your products are gonna work to be able to get out there and tell about it you know and um you know i just 

482.96 483.98 B: right 

487.74 493.92 B: and you practically have to know that like you would love the product and be able to like pitch it and like really stand by it

545.11 547.96 A: yeah and he has been 

548.05 551.85 A: in and out of the hospital his whole life he was diagnosed with it when he was a baby 

551.54 552.34 B: (( hm )) 

551.66 566.17 A: and he's been in and out of the hospital and um until we came to this business um he had a lot of pain i mean his blood cells are shaped like c's instead of like o's and he doesn't get a lot of oxygen to 'em anyway um they have a vitamin line called the daily 

566.15 575.65 A: daily for life um pack which we we purchase every month because they've got a um a vitamin called cell life which 

570.42 571.23 B: right

583.26 584.32 B: (( right [noise] )) 

583.62 590.73 A: because of your the deficiency in your blood cells so he he tried it like the first month and
