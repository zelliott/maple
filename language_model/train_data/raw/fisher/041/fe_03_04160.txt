3.15 4.76 A: hi may name's mike how're you doing 

4.45 6.49 B: hey my name's brett nice to meet you 

6.23 7.34 A: yeah good to meet you 

7.05 8.73 B: hey what part of the world are you in 

7.39 8.17 A: uh 

8.63 13.87 A: um over here um n- uh west coast california i'm living in san jose 

13.95 15.74 B: really i'm down in orange county 

15.51 17.05 A: oh excellent 

16.43 17.54 B: yeah right on 

17.28 18.82 A: [laughter] sweet 

18.32 21.14 B: yeah so let's discuss the topic of the day then 

20.89 25.12 A: that sounds good so um yeah opening a business which you'd want huh 

24.94 27.67 B: yeah have you ever tried to do this 

27.66 35.65 A: well uh you know i've i've i've dabbled in businesses but i've you know 'cause it's your your side business i don't really put the time in to it 

35.58 50.09 A: but i think if i were to open one i i think the thing i'd love to get involved in is uh is import export and main- mainly because of the opportunities it would provide you you know to to work internationally and and probably make an incredible amount of profit 

48.73 50.70 B: sure the potential 

50.91 56.27 B: i've started a couple of small businesses everything from like a small landscaping company to uh 

53.33 54.13 A: uh-huh 

56.58 61.74 B: a moving company a painting company mostly uh in a service industry like that 

59.03 59.93 A: okay 

61.51 62.51 A: right 

61.90 72.73 B: and i only ever did one that was completely legitimate where i actually did apply for a business name and tried to get my taxes and all of that together at the same time and 

66.83 67.70 A: uh-huh 

71.34 71.99 A: (( how )) 

73.12 74.66 A: how did that work out 

73.20 80.42 B: we yeah it was interesting 'cause i i submitted a uh proposal to the small business association actually i was trying to 

80.38 94.50 B: get a loan and i applied they told me that if i would present a five year business plan that showed how much my startup expenditures would be versus how much the market uh availability in portland oregon at the time where i was 

81.54 82.42 A: mhm 

94.34 95.21 A: uh-huh 

94.67 103.48 B: would generate how much money i could make and how long it would take me to pay off my initial startup cost and kick pay for my all all of my employees 

103.61 113.50 B: to where i would start being able to turn a profit after three years and i've come to understand the three year margin is when you should have any whenever you start a business you 

113.68 119.18 B: should have everything paid off in three years and be turning a profit at that point and if you're not then 

117.58 119.43 A: right 

119.26 123.83 B: the value of your business if you were to try to sell it really has no value 

123.99 127.04 A: pretty much yeah [laughter] oh 

125.43 128.13 B: yeah you know i found it to be 

128.18 138.28 B: it was kinda interesting uh just being a regular human being and stuff not rich or anything it was interesting to find out what pitfalls i ran into along the way uh 

137.56 138.67 A: okay 

138.68 143.73 B: not being aware that if i hired different mexicans uh 

144.33 153.24 B: from the country of mexico if i hired a hired one guy from the northern part and one guy from the southern part and i didn't realize there was a big animosity between the two so all of a sudden 

153.33 154.51 A: wow 

153.36 163.25 B: they were spending more time wanting to fight than they were wanting to work and so that was just one of the slight considerations and then also i found out with insurance workman's comp 

157.00 158.73 A: wow that's pretty interesting 

163.33 171.50 B: it was really an interesting thing to find out how to balance your workforce versus the load of work that you have for people to do 

172.10 181.52 B: and still try to figure out where the fine line of the balance is so you could still turn a profit after you're done paying the phone bill lights and paying for all the moving trucks or [laughter] 

181.03 186.16 A: right 'cause you always think of it just financially but you really don't think about the social interaction at all 

183.21 184.29 B: sure 

185.04 189.17 B: yeah that was something that i found out being green and not really knowing 

189.39 193.72 B: just kind of a a surprise and then of course there's how do you do your taxes 

189.45 190.44 A: wow 

193.85 202.96 B: the government wants you to either file [laughter] quarterly as a you know they estim- you want you're supposed to estimate how much money you'll make every ninety days or you can 

194.01 195.97 A: yes [laughter] 

203.10 207.63 B: file after the fact and just pay your last year off [sigh] so 

206.33 207.61 A: (( huh wow )) 

207.86 220.82 A: that's unreal yeah you've never uh yeah i've never never done anything but a sole proprietorship and and not you know you just kinda claim a side income and i never earned enough where i really had to actually pay quarterly taxes [laughter] or anything kinda got lucky i guess 

219.05 226.51 B: yeah well i didn't get quite that far either uh i gave it the old college try if you know what i mean [laughter] 

221.29 223.37 A: (( [laughter] )) 

224.09 231.32 A: there you go [laughter] that's often so what kind of business do you want to do if you were to give give yourself the opportunity 

226.89 227.81 B: yeah 

230.69 238.23 B: well i i found that the least amount of risk type of things i mean i don't know about starting dotcoms or anything like this or 

237.81 238.89 A: mhm 

238.25 241.01 B: um insurance agencies or 

240.83 251.61 B: mutual funds or all that kinda stuff never made a whole lot of sense to me i've been a working man with my hands most of my life but i can think also so i noticed a like if i had like a similar 

246.43 247.28 A: uh-huh 

251.48 261.04 B: uh thing that we're supposed to discuss today if i really did have an unlimited supply of cash to initiate the business then i would probably go into construction or remodeling 

257.69 258.51 A: (( mhm )) 

261.09 274.98 B: or some sort of a contracting situation like that see if i could buy all of the tools to good tools that it really takes and then also have the money to hire a good crew and pay for the advertising 

264.87 265.78 A: yeah 

275.00 275.94 B: to 

275.98 285.91 B: support the business and generate business while i was waiting for the reputation to be recognized and that's usually the way good old construction work goes but uh 

281.28 283.08 A: yeah 

285.11 286.63 A: right 

286.50 300.91 B: if if we had the capacity to walk onto a home site and remodel in any form or fashion whether it was repairing a swimming pool to fixing a roof to adding an addition on the side including pouring the concrete and all of that there's a lot of money in it it doesn't cost 

299.43 300.87 A: (( mhm yeah th- it )) 

300.95 315.67 A: seems to be where most of the money is in the real est- is in real estate and construction because [cough] uh you know we have so many people out here in calif- up here in northern california are uh renovating their houses because they can't sell them for what they want to sell them for 

310.57 311.49 B: mhm 

315.25 318.03 B: sure and you know it makes perfect sense that if you 

318.05 324.50 B: let's just say i go and buy a hundred thousand dollar home in a neighborhood that looks like the neighborhood's going to 

324.87 338.50 B: uh come up a little bit they're starting to weed out the the uh seedier side and you know city council's all excited about putting in some fountains and repaving the roads and all of that well that's a that's a good market right there 

329.70 331.21 A: (( [laughter] uh-huh )) 

338.20 339.52 A: right 

338.61 346.72 B: and so if i can go grab a house for a hundred thousand dollars and sink twenty grand into it and twenty grand you just for construction cost and material you can 

347.28 350.69 B: probably pull you know a hundred and seventy five two hundred back out of it 

350.35 355.43 A: exactly and it it's it's it's a little effort right [laughter] 

351.57 352.84 B: that's pretty good 

353.27 365.53 B: yeah well yeah i've noticed that there's two different sides of business some people like to make their money thinking and other people like to make their money working i've found that there's a a healthy uh 

365.73 369.55 B: uh medium right in between the two you know where you can use a little bit of both 

369.45 371.92 A: yeah yeah 

370.12 374.65 B: in fact i got the opportunity when i was eighteen to go to a seminar 

374.75 389.62 B: uh from a gentleman he was twenty three years old and became a multimillionaire and he was teaching people how to think to make money and this is what he said when i wanted to learn how to become rich i didn't look at millionaires i looked strictly towards the billionaires 

381.60 382.45 A: wow 

389.48 390.37 A: yeah 

389.71 397.11 B: the magnates of the industry huge huge barons of industry ah carnegie rockefeller dupont 

391.40 392.19 A: (( ah mhm it's )) 

397.02 409.18 B: and the one common thing that i found between all of these people was that they use other people's ideas other people's energy or other people's money to make their money and 

408.31 411.75 A: amazing huh [laughter] 

409.23 419.63 B: it really is you think about the guy who came up with smoke alarms okay it was somebody else's idea but he took that idea and he went to the insurance industry and he said hey look 

415.34 416.28 A: right 

419.59 424.78 B: if you have smoke alarms in every apartment building across the great fruited plains 

424.65 438.22 B: then your costs will go way down it will prevent uh fire loss and you won't have to pay all these premiums out or you know these compensations out that was somebody else's idea the insurance companies he used 

433.99 435.51 A: (( oh i see yeah )) 

438.17 442.80 B: their energy so he was using somebody else's energy and then all he did was solicit 

442.70 454.98 B: some funds to produce all of these smoke alarms from an investor using other people's money he got to capitalize on all three of these different things and you can only imagine he's probably not driving a volkswagen today 

451.26 452.50 A: right 

454.75 461.34 A: [laughter] no not not unless it's for novelty purposes [laughter] 

455.69 456.84 B: [laughter] 

458.47 461.59 B: right i hear you [laughter] yep 

461.52 468.62 A: that's great yeah i um i've always thought that uh you you know you really do need to look at the people who are successful in order to get successful but 

467.96 471.02 B: right you might as well aim high if you're gonna try it you know i mean i've always 

470.34 471.45 A: yeah 

470.99 483.83 B: figured also it's always a good idea to some people like to make money selling you the cheap ginsu knives or something where they can get in get out i've always found that if you do an excellent perfect job top quality of the line job 

477.32 479.68 A: right right 

483.66 490.15 B: provide a little customer support afterwards whether you're a dotcom or in my industry construction then uh 

489.41 490.16 A: (( mhm )) 

490.09 499.70 B: be available you'll be able to come back oh wow i noticed this part of something or other is a little loose hey we're right there for you and that way the reputation continues to build 

499.86 500.96 B: and uh 

501.17 507.73 B: not being one who has aspires for global dominion or anything like that i figure [laughter] yeah 

504.58 506.76 A: (( [laughter] )) 

506.90 518.02 A: well funny thing is i actually graduated in ac- uh accounting and m._i._s. i do i work on computers but i learned a lot about tax laws and one of the reasons i mentioned import export is the fact that you can travel on the company's dime [laughter] 

517.22 519.98 B: sure absolutely oh that's also a great thing 

518.73 526.54 A: you know writing off those expenses and that's to me would seem to be a little you know that's sort of your easy out right there i mean everybody needs to go on vacation right 

520.94 521.82 B: sure 

526.30 527.21 B: sure 

526.41 534.61 A: there's peace of mind thing so yeah but uh but getting started you're right getting the contacts and building that name is is probably the hardest part 

528.13 530.59 B: absolutely i fully apprec- 

533.95 540.58 B: yeah it's how to market your business okay you might have great let's say you were importing vases from uh the orient 

540.52 541.34 A: (( mhm )) 

540.66 550.21 B: and you have your import you've got everything concreted down taipei and and hong kong and all these people are ready to ship you whatever you got your tariffs and all the rest of that covered 

550.39 551.93 B: who are you gonna sell it to 

551.73 554.79 A: exactly still got just need a middle man 

552.57 556.27 B: and then the marketing of that you know is 

556.49 562.59 B: it's kind of an interesting thing when you actually when i had to submit that proposal to the s._b._a. to get my little loan 

562.76 568.55 B: and i was just having a moving company i just wanted a couple of trucks and some advertising at the local mini storage unit 

568.44 569.22 A: (( uh )) 

568.85 580.98 B: it was really interesting to apply the the theories of how can i show these folks that in three years my business will have paid itself off and then two years after that i can pay off the loan you guys gave me to 

581.69 587.13 B: create this business in the first place and still have some beans on the table while i'm doing all of this 

586.61 591.07 A: right yeah that's the hard part you say how do i pay my bills too yeah [laughter] 

588.16 589.64 B: yeah 

589.79 599.89 B: right i guess they the thing is if you have an endless supply of money to start up then it's pretty simple i mean if you inundate uh recedo with a
