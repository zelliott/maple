2.08 4.12 B: hi brett i'm marion 

4.06 7.59 A: hi marion i'm in orange county right now in california 

7.01 9.35 B: california i'm in washington state 

8.80 12.34 A: washington state i used to live up there by right by in portland oregon 

9.73 11.10 B: yeah 

12.12 14.45 B: oh yeah nice country 

12.88 13.81 A: (( yes yes )) 

14.00 18.08 A: it is so i guess we're supposed to talk about opening a business 

14.88 16.55 B: yeah 

17.80 19.76 B: yeah i guess 

19.26 24.95 A: all right well i've had a little experience with this and uh i've always found that the 

25.05 39.34 A: when opening a business it's very important to consider how much capital you have to put up front to buy equipment advertising to actually get the business up and running versus how much money you will be able to 

39.69 48.85 A: make and the goal that i always tried to set was if you can pay the initial cost off in three years then it'll might work out to be a lucrative business 

49.03 53.73 B: i've heard that three years seems to be the the key thing oh 

53.04 64.63 A: yeah it tends to work out that way because y- you're gonna have to put up the money for like your phone systems your equipment and i've always i've started a couple of smaller businesses i had a moving company 

64.70 72.39 A: uh in new orleans a long time ago which was the very first one that i ever started up with some guy sold me a truck a moving truck an old u. haul [laughter] 

71.98 74.38 B: really that good are they 

72.50 73.96 A: yeah it was like you 

74.07 88.27 A: right he says you have one month to pay off this truck we only want a thousand dollars for it but it's a twenty four foot uh truck how you gonna do it and so i thought well it's summer time and there's four major universities here so i might as well go 

74.66 75.52 B: [laughter] 

88.34 93.29 A: to these universities and move all of the kids' uh dormitory 

93.31 95.91 A: contents into mini storage units 

96.24 101.62 A: and charge 'em a hundred bucks to do it that way they don't have to make fifteen trips in their little jeeps or uh 

101.75 103.19 A: little other cars 

102.91 104.31 B: good job 

103.65 113.38 A: yeah and it started to work out to be actually a very good deal because when i started coming to the same mini storage units over and over again the mini storage units started offering me 

113.15 120.77 A: hey you know every time you come in you're making us money too and so there was a little bit of ground work laid right there and business just kept rolling 

118.69 119.99 B: wow 

120.82 121.85 A: i was pr- 

120.93 122.69 B: are you sorry you gave it up 

122.44 127.19 A: well i i couldn't live in the south that long there is no mountains or no 

127.32 129.56 A: beach to speak of [laughter] 

127.39 137.64 B: [laughter] [laughter] see that's where i'm i'm the opposite because i was raised here in washington i've been everywhere but 

130.08 131.75 A: so [laughter] 

137.84 142.96 B: uh i'm tired of green and trees i like that dead look you know 

140.85 141.80 A: (( yeah )) 

142.60 155.25 A: you know i found [laughter] it's kinda strange about that i lived in out of portland in uh i guess it was probably eighty six when i really started to travel around a whole bunch and i had been there since nineteen seventy two 

155.64 158.65 A: and used to the gray to the green 

158.75 164.73 A: and you know the three months of absolutely beautiful summer time and then to early fall [mn] 

162.61 163.47 B: (( [laughter] )) 

166.38 172.01 A: when i started traveling around i noticed there's definitely a lot of different weather environments going on 

171.81 175.67 B: yeah it really and it doesn't take a lot of miles to change it 

175.16 178.02 A: [mn] have you tried to uh ever open your own business 

177.83 183.19 B: actually i have um i had a care giving g- business where we took care of old people 

182.80 186.22 A: right my wife's a registered nurse i think that yes 

184.68 185.76 B: is she 

185.90 190.33 B: yeah well my my thing was i was taking care of people with cancer 

190.46 192.53 A: oh yeah she did oncology 

192.24 193.22 B: uh-huh 

192.81 194.24 A: yeah what 

193.34 196.65 B: and uh it it was great i i enjoyed it 

195.45 203.43 A: was it a solo practice that you actually did the business i mean you started the groundwork with the i._r._s. and everything 

201.33 202.21 B: well 

202.97 204.99 B: oh yeah i had to do that 

204.32 207.81 A: right did you have to file quarterlies after you licensed was it a 

207.71 214.70 B: well actually i did and then i went in and i talked to labor and industries and i says you know i just want to pay taxes at the end of the year period 

214.36 217.79 A: right right that's what i've usually found here instead of doing the projected 

217.71 222.47 B: oh yeah i mean that was a tough and a lot of paperwork and i really didn't have the time 

222.88 230.49 B: because the the ones i took care of personally were terminal people and so sometimes i might be there like three days straight you know 

230.01 231.86 A: sure i understand 

231.16 234.04 B: and you just don't have time to come home and do paperwork 

233.45 235.81 A: is that business still in effect today 

235.62 240.46 B: no it isn't i stopped a year ago january i did it for forty years 

240.14 243.13 A: oh wow well you know that's a commendable uh 

243.63 255.50 A: um one thing i've noticed here i was a paramedic for a little while in my life was she worked med first and then oncology and there's a certain amount of depressive uh things that would come along with that [laughter] you know so 

254.72 256.59 B: oh yeah yeah 

255.67 258.22 A: yeah you i'm sure you know the routine with that 

257.59 261.57 B: yeah after each client i would have to take two months off 

261.30 263.16 A: right that's understandable 

261.68 265.64 B: and during those two months that i had someone else work 

266.30 273.70 B: you know because yeah i couldn't handle it it was just too depressing and [lipsmack] it takes a lot out of you physically period 

273.21 283.70 A: well i'm sure that that's something to consider as far as the actually negotiating a business along those lines you know there's all kind of factors to consider and that's definitely one of 'em and 

282.82 283.89 B: oh yeah 

283.52 293.66 A: something i learned by experience was that with starting i had a little landscaping business i mean it's in- it's interesting to see the things that you would not anticipate from starting a business 

293.57 308.43 A: and then when actually you get into the field for a little bit and actually run it the there are all kind of things that pop up that you would never have considered i- initially n- yeah no matter how big of a business plan you put together and everything looks great in numbers but when it really comes down to 

301.26 302.56 B: how true 

309.04 314.62 A: do you know negotiating the business over the course of time a lot of strange things will pop up 

314.33 315.75 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

315.52 321.58 A: i noticed in my landscaping business i just started out with just a few lawn mowers and then i ended up getting a few uh 

321.71 331.57 A: clients with um industrial complexes where they wanted me to do new construction and things like just put in a pond over here full of and we'll stick a fountain over here 

330.02 333.19 B: well that that's really getting to big time there 

332.18 337.63 A: right and and well i hired a crew for these and i realized just from uh 

337.61 348.17 A: the the most efficient and effective cost effective labor was uh a group of mexicans at the time and i had to i came to learn that you can't just stick 

348.27 357.31 A: all mexicans together on one crew there is even a a difference on depending on what part of the country they were from they might have battles because one's from the north one's from the south and 

356.65 361.65 B: oh yeah [laughter] that or party time 

357.33 361.05 A: all of a sudden pr- all the activity would go right down the drain 

361.25 364.57 A: right yes exactly [laughter] 

362.44 372.47 B: [laughter] yeah i i enjoyed it when i had my business i i truly did and and i i still you know i kinda wish i was back in it 

365.48 366.51 A: (( yes so )) 

372.79 377.66 B: but uh no [laughter] i quit [laughter] [noise] 

374.51 376.13 A: yes i understand 

376.62 377.40 A: (( yes )) 

377.70 384.42 A: as did i with the responsibility of running a business i mean i've found it's always been a an even trade of 

384.77 385.56 A: uh 

385.81 399.66 A: my finances were operating on a lot more grand of a scale however at the same time the amount of stress and the amount of time that it took from my true avocation of life which is living life it it took a lot out you know so 

396.70 397.36 B: hm 

398.99 401.88 B: it did and it didn't always even up either 

401.24 403.49 A: yes exactly and 

402.55 412.94 B: [lipsmack] yeah people think you know having your own business is a piece of cake you know they they always say well gee i don't wanna work for the other guy i want my own yeah right until they get into it 

407.06 408.25 A: oh boy 

412.83 417.98 B: yeah there is so much involved you know like when i first started i didn't even know there was paperwork involved 

418.32 419.79 A: [laughter] yeah me too 

418.44 428.23 B: and i mean i knew nothing all i just knew i didn't wanna work for any more nursing homes i was sick of that [noise] so i decided to do private you know and [laughter] i 

424.42 425.72 A: understandable 

427.12 430.82 A: and then all of a sudden you got to learn just how much fun it could really be huh 

430.23 437.30 B: know [laughter] but i have no regrets on that because still you know i was my own person this way 

431.21 432.54 A: (( [laughter] hm )) 

437.39 449.05 B: you know where you work for an institution of some sort uh in the medical field and you know yourself i mean this person does this and this person does that and you know nothing ever coordinates 

437.57 438.55 A: right 

446.80 449.88 A: (( right it's a hierarchal regiment )) 

450.12 450.83 B: (( oh )) 

451.10 452.43 B: yeah so 

452.34 453.66 A: yeah it's 

454.20 463.78 A: what an interesting thing i've i've heard it said one time i forget who said it it was one of the benjamin franklin thomas jefferson thomas edison type folks who 

463.89 470.25 A: said you're either working for a living or you're working for a life and whereas you're focused on that well [laughter] 

468.70 480.11 B: [laughter] that's [mn] that's really true [laughter] yeah you have to find the balance and you know so many people just don't and i think that's why their their businesses fail 

471.88 473.72 A: it i- [laughter] 

479.98 481.84 A: yes i agree 

481.32 484.96 B: you know they either put a hundred and eighty percent into it 

485.18 487.67 B: and forget their life and family 

487.16 493.43 A: right and that's a terrible shame they might amass a million dollars and and to what avail you know right 

492.57 493.32 B: yeah 

493.35 495.69 B: and have a big old empty house [lipsmack] 

495.52 497.57 A: uh when i was a young man 

497.69 512.31 A: we had a great uncle uncle edwin and he had left home in the nineteen twenties or whenever it was at a young age and said that he would not be back until he was a millionaire and it took him sixty something years to accomplish this feat 

512.27 513.29 B: [laughter] 

512.27 524.65 A: like the gentleman lived in a uh orange grove with a in a little shack he wouldn't pay to heat his own oatmeal but he had millions of dollars coming in he finally had amassed his fortune 

524.63 530.32 A: and he tried to recontact his family of course most of them were dead at this point and he was a very 

529.10 530.46 B: oh how sad 

530.35 533.47 A: yeah and very callous man 

533.50 548.47 A: and so what he did is as he was getting ready to die he made his will so that other let's see three siblings my dad his two sisters he left one one thousand dollars he left another ten thousand dollars and left the other a million dollars 

548.36 557.79 A: just to let the legend of the curse of the money that he had lived all of his life continue on and it was an interesting and very instrumental 

557.90 568.76 A: uh thing for me to consider when i began to negotiate business myself one thing to avoid the pitfalls of how much money can confuse the issue of really living and i think 

567.80 569.45 B: oh yeah [noise] 

568.57 575.18 A: that's definitely an important factor con- to consider when one starts a business exactly how much are you willing to put into it 

574.87 575.81 B: mhm 

575.62 577.50 A: you know if you can separate your 

576.69 578.24 B: and give up for it 

577.99 582.81 A: right exactly and i i've i've seen friends of mine who have started to uh 

583.54 588.46 A: make some money in dot coms or something like this and 

588.77 597.93 A: some of them will throw themselves in head over heels and bury themselves to the point where you couldn't even get them to go see a movie or come out to dinner or something and then there's the others 

595.82 596.76 B: mhm 

597.02 598.41 B: that's not living 

598.23 599.78 A: no it's not and 

599.06 599.95 B: no it's not
