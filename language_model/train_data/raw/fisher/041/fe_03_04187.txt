3.01 4.21 A: i'm amy 

4.06 14.06 B: and i guess it we're ready to talk is that right [laughter] just about any subject huh except what we're supposed to talk about business or something like that 

7.05 10.04 A: yeah yeah [laughter] 

12.73 15.43 A: yeah opening up your own business what 

14.52 16.45 B: have you ever done that 

15.81 20.41 A: you know i never have but it's kind of funny because recently i've i've wanted to 

20.49 24.31 A: i'm not really liking my job so [laughter] yeah um 

22.39 23.58 B: oh 

23.68 38.41 B: oh i've tried opening my own business but it turns out to be a lotta work you end up working about sixteen hours a day and it's just easier to work for yourself but then again when i opened up my own business i had a partner and partnerships are pretty bad 'cause i've had three now 

27.34 28.61 A: yeah 

36.88 37.85 A: are they 

38.39 48.55 B: so that one worked out really poorly but i think if it's uh and maybe if i worked it out [noise] by opening it up by myself it probably would've done a lot better but 

38.54 39.79 A: oh really 

48.22 49.96 A: what kinda business was it 

49.30 51.64 B: [lipsmack] i had electrical business 

51.26 52.48 A: oh really 

52.12 54.31 B: yeah as an electrician 

52.79 53.71 A: oh 

54.47 58.86 B: and um but it was way back in eighty three so it was on- that was twenty years ago 

58.52 59.46 A: uh-huh 

59.18 69.68 B: and times were bad here but uh we did a lot of business during that year but like i said our partnership didn't work out so that was the main reason why we got out of business but 

64.93 65.74 A: yeah 

69.14 72.97 A: was it just differences in opinion type yeah 

71.32 79.53 B: yeah it was it a lot of it was we were doing more work than he was he was sitting on his butt all [laughter] you know 

77.34 78.63 A: (( yeah )) 

78.45 82.16 A: yeah i can see that as a problem there's somebody at work that that has talked 

82.02 96.27 A: to me at length and we've had meetings about what could we do and could open up a sandwich shop and we you know you think all these things would be great and you start looking into 'em and the franchise costs a lotta money and i know they say money is no object in the at this particular 

96.24 100.22 A: phone call so i guess that's but you know there's just so many 

97.08 98.29 B: mhm 

100.33 103.59 A: [lipsmack] if you gotta hire people and you know 

100.55 101.58 B: i know 

102.97 103.90 B: mhm 

103.94 105.46 B: i know money 

105.64 117.82 B: uh might not be um an object but you know after going into partnership a lotta times you can't get your partner to work or or they're skimming off the top or something like that and you never you never know people 

117.93 128.30 B: until you're really in business with them and it's like being in married to 'em [laughter] it's like a marriage and then when you split up it's like a horrible divorce so [laughter] yeah 

118.59 119.33 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

121.14 122.49 A: [laughter] 

122.72 123.99 A: [laughter] 

125.65 130.28 A: oh no [laughter] how long you how long was your business operating 

129.28 139.59 B: um we just had that one for um a year but i knew three months into it that we were gonna have problems because he just wouldn't he wouldn't do any work so you know 

133.22 134.15 A: uh-huh 

136.35 137.79 A: oh wow 

139.46 144.74 B: [sigh] and then i went back to work regular after three months while my husband um 

143.07 143.92 A: (( hm mhm oh )) 

144.78 152.92 B: worked at the business so i did all the book keeping at night and stuff so i was working a lotta hours and i had just had a baby and everything so it was just a real 

152.50 153.91 A: oh wow 

153.33 160.74 B: real bad situation [laughter] but we gave it a shot you know we always wanted to try it and we did and it didn't work out so [noise] 

155.09 156.37 A: yeah 

160.45 161.46 A: yeah 

160.80 171.15 B: i just wish we had learned from that one but evidently we didn't so [laughter] 'cause we went into partnership again and it like turned out worse the third time so it was just but we'll never do that again 

170.65 172.65 A: [laughter] was it the same type of business 

172.05 178.46 B: no no it was dif- completely different this time we um this time we had um we bought property together 

174.04 174.61 A: (( [cough] )) 

178.31 179.25 A: oh 

178.96 180.14 B: (( [lipsmack] and um )) 

180.01 183.11 A: on the basis that you're gonna resell it and get a profit or 

181.87 190.42 B: no no we weren't ever gonna resell it we were gonna live on the property but it was working the property it was a great deal of agricultural land and stuff 

189.99 191.16 A: oh 

190.46 195.66 B: and we end up um we bought um our partner out because 

195.69 208.36 B: it just was not going well at all it was even worse than the fir- after when i look back on it all the first partnership was the best of the three [laughter] they got worse as they exceedingly go along but 

204.27 206.11 A: [laughter] oh my gosh 

207.89 209.20 A: wow 

208.31 217.49 B: i'd really you know if anybody wanted to go into partnership with somebody i'd really say no don't do it you know because [lipsmack] somebody told me an old adage once you know 

213.40 214.36 A: yeah 

217.30 231.00 B: they said well you know god he made it he made heaven and earth and he didn't have a partner [laughter] and i said yes i sh- i should've followed that [laughter] yeah yeah but um 

222.68 225.19 A: [laughter] 

226.02 230.32 A: otherwise it wouldn't have worked uh so oh geez 

231.00 243.69 B: [lipsmack] i think maybe it's just best if you go into business for yourself you know and then you know [mn] e- either you or your or or with a you know your mate or your partner or whatever your life partner or something like you know 

234.75 235.94 A: mhm 

241.36 242.30 A: mhm 

242.96 244.63 A: yeah 

243.72 244.98 B: but um 

244.99 252.17 B: with somebody else it's just too difficult you know i i don't hardly know anybody's partnerships that have lasted at all so 

252.07 253.26 A: yeah oh wow 

252.53 262.32 B: but i know a lotta times it's for people have to g- you know su- they said that business has nothing to do with money a lotta times you have to have the money support from a second person and stuff so 

262.08 272.24 A: uh-huh well they said at the beginning of this call that money is no object and i'm thinking what would i do if money was no object 'cause it's an object now that's for sure and i i hell no 

263.08 263.97 B: yeah 

265.95 267.55 B: mhm 

268.60 269.92 B: (( [laughter] )) 

271.67 277.20 B: [laughter] so you hate your job and you wanna you wanna g- you been thinking about going into business huh 

276.82 290.00 A: yeah but you know it's one of those fleeting things where you know you really get in a rut it's your job and you start going you know i'm gonna pull out that file again and start looking at it and and what what kinda ideas did we have and you know but 

288.38 289.22 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

290.01 292.95 A: [sigh] then it gets better at work and so 

293.07 298.24 A: i i've been i work for the state and i've i've worked there for 

295.74 296.62 B: oh 

298.18 299.40 B: a long time 

298.97 307.05 A: fifteen years yeah so it's one of those you know you've got a retirement and that's something you have to factor in when you have a business is 

300.05 301.10 B: mhm 

305.40 311.24 B: mhm oh yeah you got your medical and that's really important your medical insurance [sigh] 

307.06 309.98 A: you gotta do your own retirement yep 

310.14 319.85 A: yeah yeah it's very expensive so i mean you've got to make a profit to survive and then you gotta make a profit to have your medical insurance for your family so it's 

318.05 319.68 B: (( [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

320.08 325.96 A: [cough] a lotta cost involved and you gotta really have a great idea you know 

321.69 322.61 B: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

326.19 331.64 A: and something that somebody else hasn't already thought of [laughter] or there is a really big need for 

330.44 337.73 B: [laughter] or if you're gonna have like a sandwich or a coffee shop or something it's it's i guess the number one thing is location of course you know 

336.29 346.68 A: yeah mhm yeah and i mean there's a string of coffee or of sandwich shops in the area and they all do really well but you know it's 

337.92 339.03 B: (( yeah so )) 

343.87 344.94 B: mhm 

347.01 355.94 A: what if you're the one that doesn't because they got all the good locations you know and plus it's [mn] it's fifteen thousand dollars to get into it you know just and then you 

349.26 350.38 B: mhm 

350.96 351.99 B: mhm 

354.56 368.95 B: mhm oh at least yeah i know the mcdonald's franchises are like thirty thirty five thousand dollars or something like that yeah but you must you'd le- must live in a state where the employment is pretty good huh you don't have employment 

356.29 358.67 A: yeah and then you've gotta get everything 

360.66 362.39 A: oh my gosh 

366.95 370.53 A: well washington state and it's not that good [laughter] 

369.65 371.57 B: (( [lipsmack] oh you live in so do i ))

398.16 398.95 A: oh 

402.16 403.60 A: are they really 

402.59 410.99 B: and i think it's just they're just moving out of the area so it's becoming very depressed here but housing's doesn't seem to have changed at all

410.38 412.40 A: mhm 

411.49 418.95 B: and um i've that's what i can't understand but i think it's because people can get into all these new houses with nothing down and stuff but [sigh] 

418.00 426.35 A: yeah i- it's a shame about boeing though i mean they i can't believe they didn't make them some type of deal to get them to make sure they didn't stay

471.46 472.84 B: (( oh okay mhm mhm )) 

479.28 487.40 B: well state work is pretty it's almost pretty guaranteed though you don't have a big problem with getting laid off right anything like that mhm 

480.94 481.60 A: (( yeah [cough] )) 

486.30 497.47 A: yeah e- except we're in like a two billion dollar shortfall in our budget so you know they've gotta come up come up with a way to get that money and it's probably gonna be with f._t._e.s so we'll 

497.68 503.56 A: we'll see employees are probably gonna lose their jobs this you know next biennium coming up in july so 

503.63 506.91 A: you know you just have to hope you have enough seniority to 

506.28 507.71 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

507.36 509.05 A: go through it but 

509.35 513.44 A: yeah so how has your experience been with labor and industries a little heavy [laughter] 

512.84 519.20 B: oh it's been pretty good i guess yeah yeah 'cause we i have a lotta dealings with 'em 

514.91 516.57 A: good good 

516.78 519.86 A: (( i always like to hear that uh-huh )) 

519.47 521.42 B: [mn] and um 

522.02 533.16 B: um but i've never had a claim or anything i mean you know a medical claim or anything like a lotta other people have and stuff i've been real lucky that way you know that i haven't gotten hurt on the job or anything 

526.77 527.77 A: okay 

528.93 530.10 A: yeah 

530.68 531.99 A: yeah 

533.50 534.59 A: yeah that's 

534.62 536.54 A: that's a very good thing i've 

535.55 538.00 B: (( like that yeah )) 

536.64 540.48 A: i know our claim system leaves a lot to be desired so 

539.81 545.25 B: well it's not as bad as y- as you think my i know my husband got hurt once and um 

545.49 552.78 B: they covered you know they covered everything but you know he wa- it wasn't a major accident he didn't have a broken le- anything broken or anything like that but 

551.96 552.96 A: mhm 

553.22 568.12 B: um i guess from talking to a lotta people uh it really differs from month to month it seems like how much um money they they get on on something because the same person get hurt a year later and they don't get as much money as the person before 

566.32 571.13 A: yeah there are so many rules and laws about that 

569.38 575.76 B: yeah it's all tied to what's fiscally in the in the bank i guess in in the state bank or something so 

575.12 589.15 A: it's not that but there's just so many different i mean they've got just volumes of of manuals that they have as claims managers that's why we can't hardly even keep claims managers because it's such an overwhelming job i mean 

588.39 589.34 B: mhm 

589.21 598.60 A: to know i mean you gotta be able to know where to look and oh the training is intensive and and then they get the job and then they leave [laughter] you know 

597.49 598.25 B: (( hm )) 

598.49 599.95 B: (( you don't have the inspection )) 

598.84 599.89 A: (( so ))
