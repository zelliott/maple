11.03 13.64 A: um no you can go first if you like [laughter] 

12.15 22.49 B: oh okay um i've thought of several businesses but the one i'm thinking about most right now is a travel business 

22.70 25.62 B: and i would like to 

26.22 30.04 B: i would like to focus it on people who 

30.08 39.33 B: um really want to do some travel to different lands but they are afraid to do that and so i would have a um 

39.30 46.60 B: [lipsmack] i would want a a small group i don't wanna take tours of people i would like to take two to four people to foreign countries 

46.92 51.94 B: and because i think there's a need for that and how i would go about doing it 

52.12 55.78 B: oh i think i would probably have to start by 

56.10 68.90 B: um that's that's the hardest part uh probably start by going out and maybe getting a few articles written about travels i've made to countries like china and bali and thailand and 

57.86 59.66 A: (( [noise] [noise] [laughter] [noise] )) 

68.90 71.50 B: talk about how i'd be glad to 

71.47 80.96 B: [noise] go out um once i knew the people i would be traveling with and i would go out and customize something just for them so i would 

80.91 90.08 B: um basically try to get in some things like um [lipsmack] travel magazines and feature articles and um 

90.04 100.73 B: kind of self promote without spending a lot of money and um get some folks that would be willing to let me work their dream in so they could go places they 

100.99 102.66 B: really were afraid to go 

102.78 109.67 B: [lipsmack] that's mine i think oh i don't know if i've kicked off any ideas maybe we can go back and forth 

104.50 105.86 A: [laughter] 

108.92 110.28 A: okay [cough] 

110.63 114.86 A: i think um if i were to start a business i'd probably start like a 

115.25 118.22 A: designer dress type store 

117.83 119.78 B: uh-huh [noise] 

118.41 127.58 A: um and just sell like dresses for like weddings and um for bridesmaids and proms and such like that 

126.91 127.98 B: [noise] uh-huh 

127.89 131.65 A: and i'd probably go about it by um 

131.70 132.36 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

132.78 139.20 A: going on the internet finding out information on what i need to do getting a loan and um 

140.13 143.01 A: finding somebody to design the clothes for me 

142.79 143.97 B: do you sew 

143.33 146.20 A: and doing it for myself but um 

147.44 149.23 A: i don't know [laughter] 

148.68 151.77 B: do you sew like do do you sew yourself yeah 

151.75 152.97 A: (( um a little bit ))

153.35 154.10 A: (( but )) 

158.53 163.35 A: yeah i like um drawing them out and um stuff like that 

163.65 168.18 B: [mn] i and that seems to be something that you really like to do yes or no 

167.39 168.83 A: yeah yeah 

168.11 181.18 B: okay well see that's that's it i love my paid work now but lately i i'm living to travel and that's all i can think about and do outside of work well you have to do everything else like the laundry and all that but 

179.68 180.95 A: [laughter] 

181.18 183.70 B: uh you know i think it's um 

184.33 192.21 B: [noise] i think that's where the a lot of folks just gonna go okay what could i do what could i do so that what i would be doing all my life would be 

192.62 201.47 B: um following your passion uh you know that's that's that's cool yeah i can't really think of anything other than travel and 

201.48 216.01 B: um right now that just really has me going i totally forgot about finances huh i guess yeah i would i don't wanna just do this for wealthy people although they may have to end up being my bankroll so if i had 

206.46 207.57 A: [laughter] 

216.11 221.12 B: a small number of clients that especially for whose country i hadn't recently been to 

220.95 221.81 A: (( yes )) 

221.41 223.54 B: i would have to have them like 

223.61 233.01 B: pay a retainer of some sort so i could go out and you know travel it and see the sights and and meet the native guides and so forth because um 

225.00 225.76 A: [laughter] 

233.28 247.65 B: because it would be a it would be i think it's like i can almost see the name personally you travel or you know travel the way you want i don't know the name would be the hardest thing i think [laughter] and and the and getting the the market that's 

243.19 244.36 A: [laughter] 

247.52 253.11 B: the other thing i think once you know what you wanna do you can you can do it if you can just um 

253.26 257.28 B: [lipsmack] get to the right people you know it's like okay 

257.29 267.98 B: 'cause a lot of folks wanna travel in in in like travel groups like twenty or more and i don't wanna do that [laughter] i don't wanna i don't wanna be responsible for 

257.37 258.13 A: [laughter] 

264.16 265.32 A: yeah 

267.98 282.83 B: twenty people two to four i can handle maybe six tops it'll cost extra [laughter] so that's neat well what part of the world are you from like kinda i'm not allowed to say that i don't know if i'm allowed to say that never mind well i'm from the south you can tell from my voice so 

269.00 269.96 A: mhm 

272.41 273.75 A: [laughter] 

279.66 280.89 A: [laughter] 

281.96 283.22 A: [laughter] 

283.31 286.59 B: and this is my first interview with this group so this is interesting 

286.17 287.87 A: yeah me too [laughter] 

287.17 292.53 B: well cool cool i am not looking at the clock so i have no idea ten minutes 

292.53 294.46 A: [mn] i don't know either [laughter] 

292.58 293.42 B: so 

294.15 298.72 B: okay if i had one second choice of a of of what i would do is 

298.76 300.88 B: i would have a um 

300.95 304.82 B: a nursery that would just do organic farming that would be my second one 

304.85 309.41 B: so they they didn't tell us we could go one out but that that would be my second choice because 

304.89 306.02 A: (( oh that'd be nice )) 

309.58 313.90 B: i have a organic backyard garden that would be another thing 

311.52 312.44 A: [laughter] 

313.53 314.78 A: (( that'd be nice )) 

314.53 316.78 B: yeah 

315.28 318.50 A: yeah my second choice would probably be a pet shop [laughter] 

317.74 323.75 B: ah oh you'd be at home here oh we're we're not talking the topic so we only have three animals here 

319.54 320.60 A: [laughter] 

323.78 324.88 A: mhm 

323.84 332.24 B: and that's not really true because in the backyard we have two bunny rabbits that are running through a deer that runs through in the front uh it's a regular menagerie 

331.80 334.01 A: oh wow [laughter] [mn] 

332.26 336.18 B: [laughter] that's the hardest thing is is is like you know 

336.52 341.19 B: leaving them when i travel huh that's i get homesick for them more than i do people 

338.01 338.86 A: yeah 

340.68 342.12 A: [laughter] 

341.54 348.46 B: but anyway yeah i like your idea of a of a wedding shop i would just i would be i would be so 

348.67 353.13 B: in awe of doing something like that and i was thinking about the other day a 

353.12 364.65 B: a a lady at the office was saying what what she really wished that someone would start um custom designing clothes for women in their fifties and sixties that were stylish but not like 

364.65 368.27 B: old lady clothes you know where you've got the [lipsmack] 

365.56 366.76 A: [laughter] 

368.48 374.98 B: the pants with the this elastic and stuff but that would be sensitive to people have changing 

371.00 372.32 A: mhm 

374.94 388.41 B: gravity hits you know and then then that would be a nice thing to do so older brides there's your market there's a zone nobody's ever looked at is the older bride because if you look at all the brides' magazines 

381.11 382.17 A: [laughter] 

383.81 384.54 A: (( [mn] )) 

387.66 389.06 A: they're all young 

388.56 398.19 B: they're all young and we have a tremendous amount of people getting married even first time in their forties or maybe second time 

398.73 401.86 B: you know a later marriage so 

401.93 409.20 B: yeah because that that nobody has ever done that well i've gotten gotten okay that's a sell i'm telling ya 

407.61 410.38 A: mhm [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] 

408.98 419.69 B: that is a definite sell so if you wanna go with your idea i don't know i'm i'm i've done it for you you know just get the money go for the older bride or the reluctant groom 

419.73 425.56 B: [laughter] do something to make the groom more i don't know spiff him up a little bit [laughter] 

420.19 421.31 A: [laughter] 

424.62 425.88 A: [laughter] 

425.73 440.29 B: but yeah i do like the idea of the older bride because there are there are i i see uh when i'm out i do see people trying to try on things and they just look all wrong in their twenties or th- even at you know the thirties type gown thing 

434.98 436.29 A: yeah 

440.05 441.08 A: mhm 

440.30 446.50 B: yeah and the other thing i really like on on wedding dresses i've seen a couple of them is the um 

446.51 451.10 B: [lipsmack] where they convert i i call them convertibles but it's like 

451.14 453.31 B: you can wear them again later 

453.13 454.14 A: (( yes )) 

453.80 468.52 B: you know what i'm talking about and i've seen some that even have like uh looks like [lipsmack] mm they're a longer dress and around the knee they might even have like it looks like a ribbon around it but basically underneath that it's a take off section 

464.82 466.25 A: mhm 

468.63 482.87 B: with like two lengths of it so you could have a mini or a mid calf or all the way down and the same thing with like arm sleeves so that would be very very nice to have something that could be used one more time as it were a couple more times 

481.64 483.43 A: yeah mhm 

482.82 489.24 B: 'cause that's a huge investment as we know so yeah that is neat all right 

485.51 487.25 A: yeah [laughter] 

487.82 488.80 A: (( [laughter] )) 

489.69 490.70 B: well 

490.33 491.47 A: [laughter] 

492.08 499.84 B: um i guess i can't talk ten minutes which no one that believes me would say are they gonna come on or are we just gonna run out of time or 

493.10 493.84 A: (( [laughter] )) 

495.98 497.58 A: [laughter] 

499.24 502.22 A: i have no idea i think they're supposed to come back on 

501.75 504.83 B: [laughter] so that's 

502.51 503.53 A: [laughter] 

503.64 506.02 A: (( i think that's what it said [laughter] )) 

505.22 513.39 B: that's so funny [noise] well give me a suggestion for my travel firm because truly i really am thinking about doing this in about five years 

512.48 514.54 A: oh that would be a really good idea 

514.12 516.84 B: but how would i do it how would i do it better 

516.75 517.76 A: um 

518.36 519.86 A: (( i don't know um )) 

518.87 519.45 B: (( [noise] )) 

520.64 525.61 B: what about okay i'm not gonna guess your age but i'm guessing twenties 

525.69 526.66 A: yep 

526.31 528.19 B: okay oh i'm good okay 

527.38 528.78 A: [laughter] 

528.35 533.61 B: you you don't know mine 'cause i have a younger voice than i am we won't play a guessing game [lipsmack] um 

531.01 531.90 A: (( yes )) 

532.76 533.84 A: [laughter] 

533.95 545.97 B: but i mean okay do people in their twenties even need help with that or would that be more of a thing for people that really want exotic tran- travel like [noise] rainforest travel and things like that 

546.00 552.62 A: i'd say i'd like something like that like having a guide to come with me that's maybe been there before 

551.76 553.13 B: [noise] uh-huh 

552.95 556.36 A: and that would like meet me and like help me 

556.20 562.60 B: would that be worth extra money though 'cause i mean it would you know it would it'd be it'd be a little bit more than you just like 

562.75 568.96 B: landing in brazil and going you know picking up your own guide off the street would you be willing to pay for that though 

566.76 567.80 A: (( yes )) 

568.56 569.99 A: yeah 

569.50 571.31 B: okay all right 

570.88 572.71 A: so like my own personal 

572.96 578.31 B: more of a a personal travel person yeah a tra- not you know not definitely i mean 

573.05 573.98 A: you know 

575.08 576.25 A: yeah 

578.32 588.97 B: separate lodging things like that but and that you know if you decided you wanted to have tours [noise] or but they would also be cancelable so if you were down if you got down there and you thought [lipsmack] okay 

579.55 580.56 A: yeah 

589.16 597.03 B: i really don't wanna see you know one more local museum i just wanna hang out at the pool or whatever you could do that too 

594.63 595.70 A: mhm 

596.71 597.59 A: (( yeah )) 

597.08 599.89 B: or if you wanted to do some change of plans like
