2.95 4.61 A: hi i'm wanda 

5.75 6.91 A: [noise] how are you 

6.79 8.67 B: (( i'm good thanks how are you [sigh] [sigh] )) 

8.01 9.53 A: pretty good 

9.56 15.18 A: okay our topic is if we could own our business and money was not a problem 

14.94 16.41 B: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

16.09 19.15 A: w- actually [noise] i am planning 

19.58 24.04 A: here within the next year or so to open up my own business 

23.92 24.74 B: oh 

24.79 27.15 A: i wanna open up um 

27.17 30.01 A: a restaurant a cajun restaurant 

28.60 29.18 B: (( [noise] )) 

29.78 30.83 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

30.18 36.07 A: because the area i live in it's a lotta mexican restaurants [noise] but i would like to bring [noise] [mn] [noise] 

37.18 40.48 A: excuse me i would like to bring 

40.50 43.55 A: where i'm from to where i live now 

43.64 47.16 B: mhm and where do you where are you from and where do you live now [noise] 

46.16 49.96 A: [noise] i'm from louisiana and i live in arkansas now 

50.07 51.41 B: okay [noise] [sigh] 

51.36 61.74 A: [noise] and i think it would be really interesting and i think i can really do it because everybody here when i start cooking all the neighborhood kids come can we have a plate we know you cook really good 

61.45 62.48 B: [laughter] 

62.00 69.82 A: and i'm like okay [sigh] all my kids beg me when they come to visit momma's gotta cook every time [laughter] 

69.14 71.25 B: yeah hm 

70.19 73.79 A: so i i think it would be really interesting [sigh] 

73.50 74.63 B: mhm 

76.07 83.85 B: [lipsmack] so you think that um you would probably be the main chef and just have a family restaurant kind of thing or 

83.47 91.41 A: [sigh] no actually i think if i open up my own business i wanna open up an opportunity to single mothers 

91.20 92.25 B: mhm 

91.77 103.84 A: who are struggling to make ends meet because i have a daughter who's the single mother of two children and she struggles every day to get a job and it's hard to find a sitter and everything 

94.81 95.73 B: mhm 

102.91 104.00 B: mhm 

103.93 107.88 A: so i think it'd be really interesting if i had 

108.55 111.17 A: strictly mothers 

111.28 112.86 A: single mothers 

112.52 113.69 B: mhm 

113.07 117.64 A: who can work in different shifts but also help each other out with their children 

117.81 118.80 A: i think 

117.88 119.98 B: well that would be really interesting 

119.62 123.54 A: yes i think it would it would also help out a lot 

123.26 124.34 B: mhm 

123.97 128.04 A: 'cause it's very hard in this day and age for single mothers to get a job 

128.43 130.01 A: in my opinion 

129.90 132.37 B: [sigh] yeah i think you're right [sigh] 

132.56 136.58 B: mm i must say you don't sound old enough to be a grandmother 

136.49 138.91 A: well i am i'm forty two 

138.75 139.83 B: mhm 

140.37 145.95 B: huh that's interesting i don't know if it's our connection or what but you sound you sound younger than that um 

146.71 147.50 A: (( [noise] )) 

147.60 151.40 B: so how do you think you'll go about doing that will you get a loan or 

151.70 152.96 A: [sigh] um 

152.10 154.03 B: what's your do you have a plan [noise] 

153.82 156.82 A: i my plan actually is to 

157.47 164.99 A: i've been looking into a certain building here in town and um if i get it i think i'm gonna buy it straight out 

161.51 162.39 B: mhm 

164.93 165.86 B: mhm 

165.50 170.11 A: it would be better i i find it would be better instead of going through a loan company 

170.01 171.05 B: mhm 

170.43 174.61 A: buy it straight out and set it up the way i want it 

174.44 175.42 B: mhm 

174.81 177.15 A: and get it completely [noise] 

178.17 180.43 A: (( um what's the word i'm looking for um )) 

180.68 182.37 A: get it completely 

183.00 187.26 A: done the way i want it the way i see it should be done 

184.80 185.70 B: yeah 

187.38 188.45 B: (( mhm [lipsmack] )) 

188.66 191.10 B: but that might be a lotta money to start out 

191.57 193.78 B: a business like that but i don't know 

194.47 195.99 B: i don't really have much 

196.33 197.21 B: um 

197.44 205.71 B: knowledge about how to start a business my husband is thinking about doing that so i guess um i'll kinda be going through that process with him 

205.40 206.61 A: oh okay 

205.74 209.20 B: not a restaurant but a small business and 

209.39 217.08 B: and he's he's planning on doing a partnership with another person and [mn] money is definitely an issue for for us so 

217.58 224.14 B: he has to be very careful about how he goes about it and hopefully it will be successful 'cause if it's not then he'll lose a lot 

224.22 226.46 B: of our savings but 

225.81 227.44 A: right right 

228.22 232.31 B: or his savings i guess hope not mine [laughter] so 

231.09 232.39 A: [laughter] 

233.44 239.91 B: and so it's interesting i think if i were to start my own business i would i would open some sort of um [lipsmack] 

241.13 242.43 B: counselling 

242.50 245.31 B: center or health wellness center i'm a 

245.57 250.11 B: [noise] i'm a graduate student just ending my um counselling degree so 

250.52 255.64 B: i'd like to do something like that someday on my own anyway but i'm not ready to do it quite yet 

254.73 256.65 A: [noise] oh okay [noise] 

257.88 267.86 B: yeah and i think all the all the money and the loans and all that stuff is confusing to me so i that would probably be the biggest struggle for me 

266.98 268.83 A: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

270.76 271.46 A: (( [noise] )) 

277.35 278.91 B: so would you um 

278.98 284.19 B: would you make that your full time job your own business or would you still have to do something else 

284.50 287.02 A: i would make it my full time job 

286.74 287.75 B: mhm 

287.71 297.05 A: i would make it my full time job run it until after everything was underway and going good because i would like to s- 

293.89 294.96 B: mhm 

297.16 300.50 A: once my business is stabilized and under 

300.89 305.67 A: control and everything's going good one day i would like to pass it on to my children 

305.66 306.74 B: mhm 

308.49 310.45 B: yeah that sounds like a good plan 

313.04 315.22 B: [sigh] how many children to you have 

313.38 314.11 A: so 

314.88 317.88 A: i have four kids and three grandchildren 

317.58 319.01 B: mhm 

319.95 320.67 A: (( so )) 

319.98 322.29 B: are they pretty supportive of this idea 

321.90 327.83 A: oh yeah oh yes my daughter actually is going to school to do culinary 

327.94 328.70 B: (( [noise] mm )) 

328.50 332.96 A: professional cooking she's been interested in it since she was small 

330.44 331.25 B: wow 

333.08 334.03 B: mhm 

335.52 343.37 A: so with with yours do you plan maybe five ten years or sooner or 

343.61 351.34 B: i would probably say probably in in ten years as i'm just graduating now i need to get a lot of experience and um [lipsmack] 

351.51 354.39 B: i have to go through a pretty lengthy licensure 

354.73 360.14 B: program so it's gonna be a while before i could feel good about practising on my own 

359.88 361.06 A: oh okay 

361.10 364.59 B: [lipsmack] so i have to do that and then of course there's establishing 

364.65 368.26 B: clients and getting referrals from other people 

367.86 368.91 A: right 

368.80 371.90 B: so it you know it's usually just done by word of mouth 

371.96 376.19 B: so it would take a long time to get a a good client base anyway [noise] so 

375.73 377.33 A: (( oh r- right )) 

378.07 381.10 B: it would be a while [sigh] but that's okay 

381.11 395.90 B: i don't mi- i wouldn't i'm looking forward to to working in an agency right now anyway you know i don't feel like i'm at all ready to to do anything on my own but [noise] and especially with my husband starting this new venture i think that that'll be enough for our family right now 

394.99 396.91 A: [noise] [noise] right 

401.34 406.50 B: he's actually gonna open a snowboard and skateboard shop so 

405.90 408.42 A: [noise] [noise] oh that would be interesting 

408.26 411.18 B: yeah he that's the industry that he's 

411.21 417.27 B: involved in and is r- really interested in but it's a it's a risk wherever you are so 

417.99 420.02 B: [lipsmack] i hope it goes well 

419.41 421.57 A: oh i hope so too for y'all 

421.41 423.73 B: (( [noise] yeah thanks [noise] )) 

423.97 425.97 B: so what part of arkansas do you live in 

425.95 427.68 A: [mn] little rock 

427.48 430.59 B: oh that's probably the only place i've heard of [laughter] 

430.13 438.46 A: oh wait no i'm sorry little rock is twenty miles from me it's actually a smaller town right on the outside of little rock it's uh cabbit 

435.30 436.16 B: mhm 

438.61 439.66 B: (( hm [noise] )) 

438.87 445.58 A: but most people recognize arkansas by little rock because it's like it's a lot of small towns out here 

445.37 446.44 B: mhm 

446.13 451.60 A: and little rock is the closest biggest town to us [laughter] 

450.32 451.75 B: (( mhm [noise] let )) 

452.44 454.68 B: me see do you like it out there [noise] 

454.98 460.02 A: yes i love it out here it's very beautiful there's a lotta things to do 

456.71 457.65 B: (( uh-huh )) 

462.69 465.13 B: how long ago did you move from louisiana 

465.01 466.74 A: (( [noise] um [lipsmack] )) 

467.03 468.51 A: eight months ago 

468.69 472.06 B: oh [noise] so that's a new change for you 

471.70 474.75 A: oh yeah it's very different from 

474.87 477.20 A: lots of water lots a 

477.24 480.49 A: lots of wildlife it's very different 

480.20 481.29 B: (( uh-huh [noise] [sigh] )) 

480.70 484.00 A: very different compared there to out here 

484.49 488.90 A: but it it it's more country life out here and more quiet 

488.79 490.60 B: uh-huh and you like that 

490.25 492.37 A: oh yeah where are you from 

492.64 495.11 B: [lipsmack] i grew up in montana 

495.35 498.31 B: and i right now i live in portland oregon 

498.12 499.31 A: oh okay 

499.27 500.24 B: mhm 

503.00 507.98 B: [noise] yeah so i know the [sigh] quiet country i i like that too hm 

507.49 517.26 A: right so once you would get your business up and started and running would you keep it in oregon or would you try and find 

518.51 523.26 A: a different place to try and run it would you relocate with it or 

523.86 525.64 B: um we're actually 

526.02 531.57 B: planning to move back to seattle washington in just a month or two so 

532.22 533.93 B: actually just a month so 

534.01 540.64 B: i'm planning on on establishing it there and i think that we'll probably stay in that area for quite a while 

540.69 541.84 A: oh okay 

542.80 551.61 B: yeah i really like it there and we have family there i think that's [noise] important to be [cough] in a place you liked and you're willing to stay in for a while [noise] 

551.50 553.64 A: oh yes i totally agree 

553.72 556.28 B: i think that actually starting a business is 

556.73 558.29 B: kinda limits your 

558.59 560.56 B: your moving around i guess 

560.17 562.25 A: right right 

562.75 565.89 B: you'd have to be pretty committed to wherever it is that you're living 

565.68 573.73 A: right that's why i was asking you know are y'all gonna stay there or are y'all gonna move before you plan to open your business or 

573.97 580.88 A: 'cause i've planned for many years to open a restaurant but it was finding the right place 

577.81 578.75 B: mhm 

581.31 582.29 B: (( mhm )) 

581.43 590.02 A: the place that felt right to open it and since i've moved here i've checked into places and there's a lot of fast food but there is also a lot of mexican food here 

589.82 590.86 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

590.14 592.53 A: but it's nothing like back home 

592.63 593.74 B: mhm 

593.11 595.53 A: and i really miss that so i 

595.56 599.89 A: [mn] over the past couple of months i've been sitting and really thinking about it
