106.11 108.53 B: it's about the best part of being a teacher 

108.32 112.49 A: mhm yeah i'm just a homemaker at this point so um 

111.83 113.47 B: never say just 

112.85 117.12 A: i know i never say just [laughter] i actually was an accountant wh- 

117.54 119.25 A: before i retired

127.32 133.30 B: mm lucky you i i'm not crazy about pushing pencils like that 

133.51 136.00 B: only because i found it very 

138.77 143.36 A: you know it's so different now it's not really pushing pencils everything is on the computer 

143.03 147.39 B: [sigh] yeah but if you're off by a penny you're gonna nag yourself till you find that penny 

145.23 146.76 A: [noise] 

147.08 157.48 A: oh but you know what [lipsmack] yeah that's true but then there's something called t. s. t. a. too small to a- to account for which is based upon the um [noise] [lipsmack] 

154.45 155.26 B: uh-huh 

157.56 168.82 A: you know if you're you're [noise] if you reconcile an account that's like a million dollars and you're off for a penny it's like you know it's like it's less than you know a billionth of a percent or something like that so 

161.11 161.96 B: right 

167.83 175.55 B: yeah i guess i that's the perfectionist in me it's you know it's supposed to add up right so i'm gonna keep nagging at it till i get till i find it 

175.23 177.12 A: (( oh [laughter] [noise] )) 

175.93 179.97 B: but then again i guess it's sorta the same thing with computer programs 

179.35 184.44 A: so you sound like my husband my husband's a perfectionist also and it drives me wild 

182.91 184.49 B: i'm trying to get out of that 

185.41 193.90 B: hard habit to break i'm not saying i'm good at being a perfectionist but it's a hard habit to break you're just always trying for that 

186.63 187.81 A: (( [noise] )) 

189.65 191.58 A: mhm 

191.75 203.96 A: yeah [noise] yeah we're in the middle of us selling our house and my husband is like you know everything's gotta be exactly right everything has to be cleaned up i'm like you know if i have the newspaper on the kitchen table 

203.77 208.50 A: it's no big deal i mean they're not looking at the kitchen table they're looking at the size of the kitchen [noise] 

208.66 209.73 B: mhm 

209.36 210.19 A: so 

209.96 212.18 B: but they're looking at the overall impression 

212.11 214.29 A: mhm [noise] [noise] 

212.87 214.77 B: i kinda think that 

214.88 218.40 B: i don't know if money were no object i could go into any kind of business 

218.15 219.23 A: it's true 

218.72 222.54 B: it just depends on what there's like the most profit in 

222.62 228.79 A: yeah see i don't mind doing you know opening up a store i like talking to people i like meeting different people [noise] 

228.93 233.61 A: um so i mean so that's mean i mean that would be nice and then you could also 

233.62 239.81 A: you know like you said money is no object then you can set your own hours you can work [noise] you know 

239.01 240.23 B: yeah 

240.29 243.15 A: or you can ru- or you run the right people to run the store

245.65 246.47 A: (( you know )) 

246.13 248.47 B: your husband would have a problem with that though 

248.22 249.78 A: (( [laughter] he would )) 

248.97 252.04 B: 'cause they would never do it to his standards [laughter] 

250.29 258.12 A: [laughter] it's true and you know i i tell him i say i'm you know i'm not one of your employees i said so leave me alone [laughter] 

257.59 258.78 B: yeah 

258.28 268.08 A: you know he's an attorney so he's so everything has to be precise to the leg- to the letter of the law all all the i's and the d's have to be t's have to be dotted i'm like give me a break
