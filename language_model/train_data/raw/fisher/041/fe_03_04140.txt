0.17 1.35 A: hello 

0.84 2.21 B: hi 

2.10 3.60 A: hi my name's adam 

3.14 11.57 B: hi i'm andrea andrea hi so i think um for this for this one i'd say i've i've had a business of my own 

4.50 5.52 A: andrea 

5.89 6.73 A: hi 

11.20 12.11 A: uh-huh 

11.61 13.34 B: and it was an event planning business 

13.31 14.90 A: oh i'm sorry say again 

13.64 14.53 B: um 

14.61 23.55 B: event it was event planning and public relations but now that the economy is so down no one really needs events or public relations to tell everyone how bad they're doing 

15.66 17.70 A: event planning uh-huh 

21.20 24.77 A: yeah i imagine it'd be really hard right now yeah [laughter] 

23.78 27.69 B: yeah so i'd i'd say if money weren't an issue i'd be doing that 

27.22 28.08 A: uh-huh 

27.70 28.76 B: um 

28.84 29.86 B: um i guess 

29.15 31.99 A: so i assume that business was pretty good during the boom 

31.79 46.70 B: ex- yeah it was and i i started i kind of i wa- i was m- playing around with it then and um started up closer towards the end rather then the beginning not that there was not that that was much of a time [laughter] there was a time difference there anyway there was only about two years for the whole entire thing but 

39.80 41.13 A: uh-huh [laughter] 

44.21 45.48 A: right 

47.01 50.51 B: but you know it was suc- it was successful in that you know i had 

50.87 58.07 B: you know previous previous contacts uh um from different industries that i've worked in and and i think that's how i'd facilitate doing that now 

53.10 54.18 A: right 

58.16 60.51 A: uh so what what area are you in mhm 

59.89 64.38 B: um i was actually a development director until about two weeks ago 

64.21 65.74 A: oh no [laughter] mm 

64.51 76.89 B: [laughter] so i'm uh i'm current- i'm currently interviewing for eight different like positions right now it's kind of narrowed it down to two and i think they have m- they might have two [laughter] so 

75.09 78.12 A: yeah so what what part of the country 

77.51 78.94 B: i'm in san francisco 

78.58 82.94 A: yeah me too i'm in berkley yeah 

80.15 81.24 B: in berkley 

81.62 87.55 B: yeah this is this is kind of a this is a an interest- interesting platform but but that's definitely what i would um 

87.59 89.43 B: i mean if money weren't an issue 

90.32 96.20 B: um that that's what i would do because otherwise you know i wouldn't be opening a law firm because i'm not a lawyer 

95.88 96.90 A: right 

96.35 102.55 B: um you know drea- dream job would be interior decorator but that's also you know i don't have a certificate for that so that's 

102.53 104.22 A: do you need a certificate 

103.65 107.11 B: oh you do actually i mean if if i mean and so so 

104.63 106.95 A: oh really that that's a little strange 

107.36 117.38 B: so if the question was money is not an issue um i also bring to the table is education an issue and [laughter] and i think that would be you know certification i've got you know a college degree but i don't have [sigh] 

110.21 111.59 A: how how do you get a 

112.56 113.68 A: right 

116.95 122.05 A: h- how do you get a certificate for interior decorating it's is is it like apprenticeship 

121.46 128.03 B: um it's i i mean i know that a different u._c. berkley extension offers courses a- and a- as far as that 

125.53 126.73 A: mhm 

128.17 134.00 B: so if m- money was no object i'd probably you know and money and time were no object then i'd be going back and doing that 

133.68 134.96 A: (( [noise] right )) 

134.07 137.17 B: you know and and doing so that you if 

137.35 144.77 B: they have different kind of programs there's two year programs i know there's you know you can go you can go to school and get an associate degree or 

139.90 140.79 A: mhm 

144.88 148.93 B: you know it's a t- t- i think there's two year pro- programs and there's four year programs so 

146.25 146.99 A: yeah 

147.87 153.46 A: yeah i figured there was there was probably plenty of education involved i just didn't realize that there was a certification 

152.39 166.02 B: [sigh] yeah there's there um to be part of the a._s._i._d. i guess there's some kind of kind of some some kinda yeah i wish i don't even know what that i'm not exactly quite what that stands for but um yeah a._s._i._d. certification 

156.64 158.71 A: mhm i see 

166.17 178.87 A: yeah yes i'm actually i run a s- a small business on the side i'm actually a student right now but i also have been running a web company doing advertising apartment complexes up in seattle i used to live up there 

166.85 167.63 B: so 

176.70 177.78 B: (( oh okay )) 

178.75 179.55 B: (( mm mm )) 

178.93 181.67 A: but we're we're probably gonna close it down [laughter] 

181.00 182.19 B: right 

182.35 187.14 A: well we we started it just as a hobby and the problem is none of us are salespeople 

182.53 183.49 B: yeah 

187.45 188.43 B: right 

187.47 188.85 A: and so uh 

188.87 197.62 A: uh back during the boom everyone was willing to sort of sign up with us despite the fact that we didn't have really a good sales staff but now 

196.22 197.16 B: right 

198.02 205.93 A: you know we're losing clients and none of us wanna go out and pound the payment pavement and do hard hard selling so we're probably just gonna let it die out 

201.95 203.00 B: (( [noise] right )) 

203.65 207.39 B: right 'cause th- you don't think it's gonna s- you don't think things are gonna sell right now [laughter] and 

207.42 218.26 B: [noise] was is the other problem i don't yeah i i think i think anything right now is is a particularly hard s- sell if y- so as far as starting a new business right now um i don't see 

208.89 211.21 A: yeah yeah 

212.84 214.20 A: yeah that's true 

218.58 221.09 B: [noise] um ev- even with money being an issue 

218.66 219.67 A: yeah i guess with 

220.81 221.91 A: right 

221.26 225.01 B: i think that you know i- it's hard to get people who are in um 

225.39 230.00 B: it's much easier to do a sole proprietorship and not build the team right now that's that's what i could say [noise] 

228.58 239.23 A: that's right that's for sure i guess the other thing also is the the question is a little strange because they also ask do you think you would be successful but if money's no object then what do they mean by successful 

230.34 231.32 B: because 

238.52 243.44 B: right exact- exactly yeah i mean what [mn] i mean how can you know how can you measure that 

239.40 240.77 A: [laughter] 

243.81 251.05 B: are you talking about monetary [laughter] success or or or like or just having fun you're happy with this you know because yeah 

245.16 247.98 A: that's right or j- just having fun 

248.76 249.62 A: yeah 

250.97 262.19 A: i guess if if money were no object i'd wanna start a independent research company 'cause that's what i like doing i like learning learning new stuff and so uh computer and uh just general science research 

256.52 257.60 B: oh yeah 

261.98 262.75 B: hm 

262.38 271.09 A: definitely be what i'd be most interested in but it's very expensive you know it's hard to do that um unless unless you're a university or a big company 

267.50 268.67 B: right 

270.85 272.60 B: right right [sigh] 

272.93 277.09 B: yeah i mean there there's definitely other things that i that i would probab- probably do um 

277.74 287.07 B: i mean be as far as career goals be interested in but i don't think that they would necessarily um be facilitated through starting your own company 'cause i have a i have a politics background so i think that 

279.77 280.57 A: right 

284.04 284.89 A: yeah 

286.08 287.39 A: yeah 

287.27 293.06 B: i would think that um and you know when you work in politics you don't necessarily have your own corp- you don't have a corporation you 

292.53 294.68 A: right or not necessarily 

293.09 296.55 B: usually work for someone or or run run your own office type [noise] 

296.24 297.95 A: right 

296.58 299.11 B: type type of thing consulting group maybe 

299.54 302.94 A: i'm also sure i'm b- i would be very bad at it [laughter] 

302.95 304.91 B: yeah yeah 

303.94 306.75 A: i just don't think i would make a good business person 

306.65 317.65 B: yeah i i i'm yeah i i think i'm i'm definitely uh a better business person but i think i have enough business sense to know not to start one right now [laughter] [laughter] so 

313.69 318.21 A: right that's right i guess that's part of the business sense knowing when it's not 

317.94 319.72 B: yeah so um 

318.63 320.71 A: not time to do it 

320.25 323.02 B: i mean i recently got a phone call from a guy who's starting 

323.01 337.25 B: his own um well he's he's been in the business for se- for eleven years um i think by himself and he's trying to [mn] grow a team to sell um corporate sales packages hospitality packages to people and he called me for an 

326.57 327.58 A: mhm 

336.25 339.31 A: mhm again bad timing yeah i would think 

337.42 342.08 B: for yeah for an interview you know and he's great it's a great company and it was like for final four 

341.81 343.00 A: right 

342.26 348.00 B: to sell the fin- like final four you know l._a. lakers you know world series games 

347.78 348.70 A: mhm 

348.06 355.11 B: um to you know top fortune five hundred companies and he was looking at paying people a seven hundred dollar um 

355.26 361.19 B: you know base salary per month and then plus commission which is you know offers no one any type of substantial 

361.07 363.36 A: right no no one's gonna wanna do that 

362.77 365.18 B: no one's gonna really wanna do that so 

364.05 365.00 A: (( just yeah )) 

366.00 367.01 B: so i mean he 

366.28 367.92 A: yeah it's a hard time you know 

368.13 374.60 A: a couple of my friends started a little architecture company in this area uh a couple of years ago it was actually right after nine eleven 

374.33 375.36 B: right 

374.70 378.16 A: lousy lousy timing for them they've really been struggling 

377.57 386.70 B: oh yeah now that's i mean that's that's probably the worse thing i mean the the develop i mean developers are never hurting but but you know the devel- the developers who did have projects stopped [mn] 

386.09 393.05 A: well everyone put projects on hold after nine eleven you know every one of their big projects wanted to delay 

389.15 390.67 B: yeah or 

392.83 394.17 B: yeah i believe 

393.35 395.39 A: and they're only now picking up again 

395.00 400.81 B: yeah i believe a lotta just everything was put on hold after that after after the technology boom and then that 

397.74 398.57 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

400.82 404.27 B: everything has just gone um gone south 

404.42 405.81 B: and uh you know 

405.91 410.95 B: i mean of course opening your own business without a um with no financial obligations [laughter] 

410.81 412.55 A: yeah it would be a lot easier 

411.29 425.72 B: would be fantastic [laughter] but right right but that's not the reality right now and everyone has um i think significant i mean i fortunately don't but i have you know i have a car loan and i have a home loan but i don't have any i don't have any um 

412.62 415.24 A: yeah huh but it doesn't happen 

423.19 424.40 A: right 

425.82 430.74 B: credit card debt which i think everyone is also doing right now i think people are in significant 

428.50 430.92 A: yeah building it up certainly hm 

431.08 439.68 B: credit car- i mean i don't have a friend who's not in significant credit card debt it's something i never talked to them about but you know as as the economy was going sour everyone's getting a little bit you know 

440.01 440.83 B: less 

440.92 447.65 B: confident and things are starting to come out of the woodwork like i found out my friends owe fifteen thousand dollars on their credit card or 

446.51 447.67 A: oh my 

447.67 458.01 B: or you know or or or you know they have have school loans that they keep putting off that i would never even i would never even imagine i mean these people are you know thirty five you never you'd ne- wouldn't think that they'd have 

451.45 452.29 A: yeah 

457.52 459.40 A: still have school loans sure 

458.49 464.01 B: school loans yeah i mean it was something or you know they're thirty you know i thought that that's something that you pay you know i 

464.04 473.68 A: [lipsmack] well one thing about it though is the the school loan interest is so low you actually wanna extend it as long as you can you're you're better off taking that money and and investing it 

464.04 465.84 B: that's something you pay off [laughter] 

469.73 470.95 B: right 

473.16 475.19 B: right right exactly 

473.73 483.88 A: because the interest rates are low but well in the tech field at least it it doesn't seem as bad as the media portrays almost all my friends who work in silicone valley are still employed 

483.67 484.88 B: right 

484.18 494.68 A: you know the all all the ones who have education and experience are employed the ones you know who who were less educated and have less experience they're they're having more of a hard time 

494.30 504.60 B: right i i think for i think for something to be successful right now you just have to really have some kind of product that you're selling or service that you're offering because anything else is it the 

501.39 502.21 A: (( mm )) 

505.44 507.75 A: right the the false web economy 

505.79 506.90 B: you people 

507.25 513.16 B: people yeah people c- yeah people exact- yeah people can people can you know it has it has to be a real 

508.22 509.91 A: no business models 

513.80 517.88 B: something something real that you're offering something that they can't get in house something that 

517.17 519.09 A: (( that's right )) 

518.46 521.50 B: that has some sort of other liability um 

521.69 523.61 B: that they can't take hold of so 

523.62 524.75 A: yeah 

524.04 525.53 B: uh i don't see anything 

525.98 532.53 A: yeah it's uh pretty hard in research too you know that that's what i would like to go into but uh the business climate 

526.11 526.89 B: (( i don't )) 

530.93 535.91 B: healthcare hea- yeah hea- yeah he- i mean if you wanted to go into that i think healthcare is like an excellent 

532.86 534.06 A: is pretty hard 

535.63 539.10 A: for h- research or or yeah yeah 

536.32 537.10 B: health 

537.12 546.43 B: yeah healthcare is just huge right now i mean there there's there there are somebody that nursing and healthcare and and well i mean i don't know about biotech they're still kind of 

539.35 540.86 A: yeah i guess that's true 

546.57 550.02 B: scraggling along but they're [noise] you know they're they're stable 

549.69 555.23 A: yeah i guess that's true you know as the population gets older they'll be spending more and more on healthcare 

552.59 553.49 B: yeah 

554.56 556.80 B: right right so 

555.56 556.71 A: but uh 

557.06 558.69 B: so that's something that i think 

559.05 565.25 B: i think i think would be [mn] but um but yeah you know in all fantasy i'd open up my own disneyland if i had 

565.03 568.58 A: that's right if you had [laughter] if money were really no object 

565.56 567.22 B: [laughter] 

567.58 570.37 B: if we're [laughter] yeah sure you know i'd open up a 

571.01 575.64 B: a a disneyland i'd have a private jet i think i'd probably be traveling to 

573.26 574.20 A: yeah 

575.78 576.71 B: you know 

575.89 579.91 A: yeah where would you put your disneyland [laughter] though hawaii 

578.35 579.56 B: (( yeah i don't know [mn] )) 

579.83 583.44 B: yeah yeah something like that you know san francis- yeah san francisco 

583.72 588.22 A: i guess that's the other thing is if you money were no object you could open your business anywhere 

587.56 592.43 B: [noise] yeah i'd probably actually if money were no object i'd probably open up a company that knocked down hunters point 

592.59 599.23 B: and rebuild housing there no serious- like a development company and rebuild the housing there and like you know cleaned up the city or something 

592.84 593.83 A: [laughter] 

594.22 595.56 A: right 

596.32 598.26 A: yeah yeah a nice area 

598.85 599.69 A: yeah
