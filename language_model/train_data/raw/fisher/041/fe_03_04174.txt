143.49 144.82 B: oh man 

145.20 154.67 B: and i- i- that kind of thing when you lose a job like that is like difficult because i used to be an interpreter for deaf a while back

200.78 204.39 B: so you already got your business plan going and all of that 

203.63 209.20 A: oh definitely you know if you spend your whole life working for somebody else you're never going to get ahead 

208.54 211.21 B: (( that is so true that is so true )) 

210.00 221.53 A: i- it really is a lot of my family members have opened their own businesses they're small but you know sometimes you know nob- not everyone has money to start out with you gotta start somewhere 

215.69 216.91 B: mhm 

220.94 224.80 B: yeah that's true yeah i i think right now 

224.94 229.96 B: i'm i'm still in like the uh the what is that fact finding phase of 

229.61 230.63 A: yeah 

229.95 240.13 B: i've been doing a couple of seminars here and there trying to figure out what would be better just to do the the limited liability or just do the incorporation 

240.27 241.49 B: and i i'm 

241.62 253.98 B: i'm i'm still i still have toss ups about that but you know it's like a lot of people say it's better to incorporate i don't know where what state you're from but in california it's like better to have 

253.97 257.11 B: (( inco- in a corporation yeah )) 

254.54 255.96 A: is that where you're from 

256.37 258.20 A: where what part

286.74 289.74 A: oh i love california i can't wait to get back 

289.55 291.23 B: yeah the weather huh 

290.83 297.21 A: oh yeah this weather out here sucks [laughter] i know we're not even talking about the topic but [laughter] 

293.16 293.92 B: (( right )) 

296.27 298.93 B: [laughter] oh well [laughter] 

298.21 313.13 A: yeah but uh i think in your field though the problem you're you're really running into i mean i understand with the medical god there's so many codes and laws and state bills you gotta meet and everything else with me it's just having a little bit of insurance and 

299.23 300.12 B: yeah 

307.64 308.66 B: yeah 

312.45 313.85 B: mhm 

313.56 314.65 A: you know 

314.62 319.56 B: yeah i think it's a you know a a lot more licensing involved you know 

319.37 320.56 A: yes 

319.66 324.50 B: the discipline codes and all of that i'm seeing 

323.93 329.86 A: yeah you got state walking in all the time up your butt trying to see what's going on so 

326.25 327.51 B: yeah 

329.96 338.30 B: yeah then um thinking about you know like what i see on my girlfriend's job it's like uh finding quality people you know 

338.06 348.35 A: yeah you gotta find those dedicated ones and it's like one out of every twenty thirty people so you hire so many and then you figure out who the really great ones are 

340.21 341.63 B: oh man 

344.39 345.13 B: (( exactly )) 

347.84 351.11 B: exactly and oh man it's 

351.12 354.33 B: it's a it's a mess because you know you're thinking you 

354.35 365.02 B: can you get mostly females you know there in uh in the field right and so you like you know you figure that their maternal instincts'll kick in there whatever 

358.57 359.65 A: yeah 

363.48 364.40 A: (( right )) 

364.66 366.00 A: [laughter] 

365.22 372.01 B: but some of 'em it doesn't it's like whoa it you can't go by the stereotypes on that 

368.69 369.86 A: yeah 

371.44 376.47 A: no you can't it's actually the nursing field's really starting to fill up with males too 

376.10 377.68 B: (( yeah so i've )) 

376.86 384.73 A: at the school i'm at they have the l. p. n. program there's a lot of guys 'cause the guys are seeing hey the medical field's high demand and the pay's big 

384.38 386.14 B: seen yeah yeah 

385.01 396.27 A: i mean you you can go to school for four years and make thirty five bucks an hour in california as an r. n. or you can go to school for four years to become an engineer and then have a hard time finding work 

389.97 390.98 B: exact- 

396.08 399.83 B: and the competition for engineering is like phenomenal 

399.24 413.38 A: yeah i work side by side with an engineer he was a structural engineer at enron on the assembly floor making thirteen bucks an hour with me when we started and this guy had a four year degree and all i had was uh four years of military 

404.72 405.76 B: (( oh oh )) 

405.88 406.62 B: (( yeah )) 

407.54 408.90 B: man 

413.31 414.14 B: hey 

413.36 415.65 A: you know [laughter] 

414.69 417.99 B: but did you think it helped because you have the military or 

417.78 420.73 A: no i mean there's guys in there who spent eight years in prison 

421.00 423.04 B: you're kidding eight years 

421.33 426.62 A: yeah we had ex-cons working with us too so sometimes it don't pay to go to college 

424.23 424.95 B: (( ooh )) 

426.96 433.91 A: that's why i'm doing h. back now like my my dad had told me i mean honestly it made sense i listened to the old man for once [laughter] and 

434.01 443.84 A: you know the economy drops and your plumbers your electricians your trash men just all the things you regularly really need is what you gotta shoot for sometimes 

438.13 439.75 B: (( [laughter] hm )) 

443.28 445.05 B: yeah yeah yeah 

444.00 445.96 A: medical field 

445.61 449.03 B: the the lab- quote unquote labor jobs 

449.09 459.17 A: yeah no but you you know always i i'm honestly laughing especially in california everybody and their brother seems to think that computers are the way to go 

458.82 460.95 B: [laughter] yeah pretty well 

459.62 470.75 A: but they don't realize occur- like what maybe there's probably fifteen percent of this country all thinking they're gonna get this computer degree and make all this money [laughter] 

468.61 469.58 B: yeah 

469.65 480.14 B: that's true that's true and it's like they can get down to all these other jobs wide open 'cause no one wants to do the the manual labor so quote unquote 

478.49 481.77 A: yeah no one wants the grunt work [laughter] 

480.38 485.05 B: yeah exactly everybody wants the crisp computer job 

481.97 482.99 A: that's why 

484.82 485.77 A: unt- 

485.46 486.40 B: (( [laughter] )) 

486.30 501.13 A: oh yeah i mean you know the sad thing is in in this country a lot of people don't know it if you you just go work for a company cleaning septic tanks for about a year you could open your own septic tank cleaning business and make about eighty thousand dollars a year 

501.26 505.15 A: doing it for yourself but it's just a it's a dirty job 

504.86 506.30 B: yeah 

505.80 509.28 A: but the rewards are you're your own boss 

508.90 509.90 B: true 

509.56 520.45 A: you don't have a t- time clock i mean yeah this the topic i like because working for everybody else you're gonna go and do a job hand the money to the boss and then he's gonna hand you a portion of it 

519.85 522.45 B: yeah a small portion at that 

521.74 525.14 A: exactly you're lucky to see ten percent of what you did 

524.52 533.56 B: yeah yeah i hear you i hear you yeah i think uh opening a business is you know a a good thing to look forward to it's uh 

532.35 542.57 A: oh yeah you just gotta have the spouse wi- that has a stable job when you're getting started so you don't starve [laughter] you know what i mean 

537.98 540.28 B: yeah [laughter] that does help 

540.77 543.44 B: (( yeah somebody has to [laughter] )) 

542.58 549.42 A: that that's the sad truth that that's why i'm pushing my wife i mean she she finishes l. p. n. she's gonna fast track to r. n. 

549.09 550.34 B: (( oh yeah )) 

549.72 553.92 A: i won't even try to open my business until she's making some good money 

553.54 554.81 B: i hear you 

554.57 557.76 A: yeah she you know what it's like in california 

556.76 559.30 B: oh yeah it's crazy if you don't have 

558.17 563.63 A: i love california and i'm not leaving when i get back so we gotta make it work [laughter] 

561.48 562.40 B: yeah 

562.77 568.07 B: yeah you gotta have two or three incomes to you know just to survive 

567.64 570.40 A: especially you you're in l._a. [laughter] 

570.09 571.28 B: yeah 

570.52 573.30 A: that's where my grandma my aunts and uncles live 

573.15 575.92 B: yeah l._a. is no [laughter] 

575.54 582.92 A: oh not actually l._a. lynwood up near knott's berry farm you can see the knott's berry farm tower from their house 

579.20 580.71 B: uh-huh oh yes 

582.32 583.76 B: oh really 

583.41 586.95 A: yeah so you know where they're at they're right over there 

585.00 586.06 B: (( yeah )) 

586.40 594.21 B: yeah yeah that that's an okay area it's still kinda reasonable to stay over there 

587.81 588.75 A: but 

594.83 596.90 A: it's still expensive [laughter] 

596.29 597.99 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

597.14 599.26 A: anywhere near those cities 

599.15 599.89 B: (( [laughter] yeah ))
