28.02 32.05 A: that is so uh uh [sigh] surprising because 

32.14 44.06 A: i wasn't thinking about the topics and i've only thought of it for a good second between the time that they you know hold to get you [lipsmack] and my first thought was uh 

39.96 40.74 B: (( yeah )) 

44.32 54.47 A: i'd like to have a plant store i love plants and i like to uh make things grow and watch them grow and uh flowers come the same way and it's 

53.98 54.87 B: [noise] 

54.68 58.88 A: it's funny that it would be uh similar 

59.20 60.21 A: um 

60.45 63.17 A: and money's supposed to be no object so 

63.45 65.74 A: do you have any ideas of what you would do 

66.13 70.97 B: i would open a nice little florist shop and i would sell all kinds of flowers 

70.46 72.14 A: uh-huh 

71.44 74.34 B: (( um roses daisies um )) 

74.63 78.23 B: daffodils [noise] plain [noise] 

77.09 79.50 A: yeah and uh 

79.70 81.22 A: um 

81.54 85.55 A: would you have to have specialized 

85.58 86.50 A: uh 

86.97 94.34 A: um equipment or a special kind of location or how would you get a location or do you have an idea of where you would want it to be 

94.01 97.28 B: um yeah right here in where close to where i live in tarrant 

97.49 98.51 A: uh-huh 

98.64 100.71 B: an old beauty shop [noise] yeah 

100.29 102.94 A: an old beauty shop that's great it's uh 

103.07 105.18 A: to still provide 

105.29 106.74 A: beautiful things 

106.79 108.00 A: nice things [lipsmack] 

106.82 107.38 B: (( [mn] )) 

109.14 113.82 A: that's great and uh i would 

113.87 126.64 A: like to have one also right here where i live very close by it's a big business district in a um downtown area and uh other you know f- fairly 

123.36 123.94 B: (( [noise] )) 

127.06 132.12 A: a a city of ninety thousand so it's not a big downtown [lipsmack] but i would 

132.32 145.85 A: look around there and find the kind of plants that would do well indoors and outdoors here so that i wasn't you know getting a lot of returns and losing a lot 

145.68 156.16 B: well no i think about that i'd probably i'd probably choose one around the country sort of around the countryside that way you know i could plant some things outside and all that and watch them grow and all that 

150.19 151.46 A: (( and )) 

156.14 157.50 A: yeah 

156.93 159.78 B: and that way i wouldn't have to worry about people running them over 

160.09 161.93 A: right 

162.35 164.32 A: yes that's indeed 

164.61 169.20 A: uh is it a very small tow- um [cough] and the uh 

170.28 174.64 A: [lipsmack] flowers would be along the side of the road would you cut them for sale 

174.95 176.71 A: or would those just be for you 

175.51 176.15 B: (( i )) 

176.18 183.58 B: probably wouldn't because i could use those as example of some of the flowers that i would have in my shop [noise] 

183.10 189.86 A: [mn] right there on the like a living sign for the flower shop oh that's a great idea 

185.52 186.40 B: yes 

189.97 204.66 A: that's an excellent idea i would put a lot of uh [lipsmack] variety of plants maybe even uh different kind of settings in the windows of a a store for myself for the plants and show 

204.74 206.83 A: um 'cause it's 

207.01 208.72 A: (( got the )) 

208.83 216.68 A: ocean and water here but it's also next to the dry mountains and it's also next to the very hot desert [lipsmack] a lot of things don't grow 

214.75 215.61 B: oh 

216.85 228.20 A: and a lot of things grow very well so i'd have to learn a little bit more but it would be a dream and it's sort of what it is a hypothetical business 

222.39 223.46 B: (( yes )) 

228.58 230.99 A: something that i would uh 

231.64 239.21 A: like in the best of all possible worlds if if i were just to stop work now and do something 

239.62 243.59 A: the idea of money being no object of course being the big thing because 

242.01 244.51 B: yes that's that's the only problem 

244.36 251.87 A: yeah [laughter] because that's usually what your business is about and it takes money to open it and it takes uh 

252.03 256.41 A: uh you know and you could lose it so money being no object 

256.51 258.31 A: it would be a plant store 

258.34 272.58 A: full of uh palm trees and and uh spider plants and um uh flowering indoor plants and unusual plants that you could really grow indoors just about anywhere in the 

272.40 278.55 A: world they may not do well outside in a lot of places or especially places where it snows or something 

278.49 279.70 B: (( where do you live )) 

279.95 281.33 A: uh california 

281.22 282.99 B: oh really [noise] 

283.75 284.85 A: (( yes )) 

285.76 287.89 A: um and 

288.29 295.15 A: of course it's uh a very easy place to farm and grow plants all kinds of things for 

295.29 298.42 A: so and i suppose i 

298.62 304.89 A: i see some other people at some farmer mar- farmers markets where i sometimes i buy some plants 

304.84 316.64 A: and they look like very like they have a happy existence a comfortable existence and i know the fulfillment that you get from um 

317.04 326.79 A: plants that i get from it and giving that to other people providing that for other people at a fee would be uh rewarding and a nice a nice 

324.75 325.35 B: [noise] 

326.71 327.68 B: mhm 

326.91 329.12 A: way to live and a a really 

329.23 331.98 A: nice way to make a a living 

331.64 335.90 B: [noise] yeah i think that would be i would love to do that 

336.70 337.28 B: [noise] 

337.30 339.26 A: yes uh 

340.37 342.31 A: do you grow 

341.83 342.86 B: [noise] 

342.44 348.58 A: would you have plants in there like seeds and things that you could sell to people 

347.09 349.67 B: yeah that people could grow their own self yeah [noise] 

351.33 354.40 A: and that store is in um 

354.84 356.89 A: the countryside 

356.30 358.12 B: [noise] it would be better 

357.00 359.87 A: is it does it snow there 

359.58 360.39 B: huh 

360.07 363.10 A: [lipsmack] does it snow in in that countryside 

362.56 364.77 B: oh no no not really [mn] 

364.17 366.58 A: no it's it's a warm enough climate 

366.86 370.99 A: that's a great idea to have the plants outside again like a 

371.16 372.09 A: uh 

372.78 386.96 A: a welcome sign like this is what we have and i've seen it here in california just like that [lipsmack] flowers on the side of the road and just beyond it behind it are 

386.61 387.82 B: (( flower shop [noise] i've )) 

386.90 392.92 A: a field of flowers yeah well on real flower farms those are pretty spectacular 

392.99 395.45 A: you know the ones that are two or three acres and are 

394.79 396.68 B: never been to one but 

396.00 396.93 A: uh 

397.90 400.30 B: (( yes i'm i'm planning to go to one )) 

400.59 403.92 A: good good well you'll need to go to one 

403.99 411.56 A: if you have a florist shop so that you can tell other people about what they're like and where they come from 

411.87 413.40 A: and what to 

414.45 421.27 A: look for if they're out there maybe in the wild looking for them ways that they grow [lipsmack] 

420.81 421.67 B: (( oh [noise] )) 

422.88 428.35 A: they grow in big stripes they usually put all the same colors next to each other 

428.52 431.64 A: and from the r- the road far away 

431.14 433.73 B: (( yeah they look very very pretty )) 

433.43 440.72 A: yeah it looks like uh stripes and that also is a place to sell flowers 

440.94 441.62 B: (( mm )) 

441.05 445.98 A: so right in front of those places e- especially the ones uh 

446.24 450.75 A: near they're not that nearby they're about a hundred miles away in calif- in 

450.83 453.22 A: southern california but they have uh 

453.48 454.57 A: um 

454.86 457.54 A: roadside uh uh 

458.34 462.57 A: shops right in front of the flower farm [lipsmack] that sell 

461.33 462.00 B: (( mhm oh )) 

462.60 473.04 A: plants that would do very well in the climate right around there and the climate right around there is the best for growing flowers that's what they 

473.06 480.51 A: that's what they do there but if you're visiting or if you live uh a hundred miles this way or a hundred miles into the desert 

480.54 486.97 A: you'd have to get something different so you have to ask them [lipsmack] and you have to be very knowledgeable about how [mn] 

486.60 487.55 B: (( you see )) 

487.91 491.15 B: i live in birmingham in alabama 

490.62 491.67 A: yeah 

491.34 492.67 B: and 

493.02 494.16 B: the weather's 

494.37 500.34 B: really weird at times so it's really hard to open one here and have nice flowers outside [noise] 

500.88 502.04 B: and in the 

502.24 506.87 B: town i live in here i- i mean it's a nice town and all but we have people who 

507.49 510.12 B: [noise] who don't really care they'll run over anything you 

510.59 511.29 B: know 

510.68 511.73 A: (( ah )) 

511.33 514.71 B: usually they just off anything they'll smash it up just 'cause they can 

515.07 517.84 A: oh uh a kind of angry 

517.50 519.15 B: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

518.13 519.86 A: (( hm )) 

520.04 523.82 A: [lipsmack] that's a problem that's a problem for all 

523.88 526.56 A: of the small business owners 

526.86 539.24 A: in in l- in and in california certainly the big cities it's a very big problem um a plant shop to have say uh graffiti and and tags of uh 

539.33 541.21 A: gang members or something 

541.22 544.08 A: that's a challenge for a business owner 

544.35 548.12 B: [noise] [noise] i think that would be a very big challenge [noise] yeah 

548.04 562.11 A: yeah it it is and uh and there are as uh many solutions as you can find for that for business the vandals or or 

562.17 567.90 A: delinquents whatever delinquent adults too maybe not juvenile uh 

568.46 580.67 A: will figure out a new thing to do to you [lipsmack] to the businessman just because they're whatever and these are a little jealous of uh somebody's who's trying to do something and 

578.08 583.03 B: [noise] because they're they've been an immature idiots who have nothing better to do 

583.16 585.79 B: except for destroy things that isn't theirs 

586.61 587.69 A: yes 

587.92 589.47 A: exactly 

589.76 590.81 A: (( uh )) 

592.15 599.89 A: that's um [lipsmack] what you have to be looking out for you have to watch uh you know over your shoulder
