4.98 6.47 A: (( hi wayne how are you i'm )) 

6.27 9.23 B: doing very well in nashville tennessee 

8.65 10.79 A: (( in ah nazareth pennsylvania )) 

10.83 14.74 B: and ah i understand the topic is what does family mean 

14.14 15.18 A: yes 

15.42 16.48 B: (( ah )) 

17.63 20.12 A: well would you like me to start or would you like to start 

19.51 21.59 B: oh certainly feel free 

20.95 23.65 A: [laughter] well um 

23.80 30.18 A: i guess the most important thing about a family is that you all care for each other and respect each other as much as possible um support each other is a big thing 

30.65 34.88 A: ((  )) 

35.45 38.30 A: ((  )) 

38.26 43.99 B: well i happen to agree with all of those things only because ah it's the situation i find myself in 

44.27 45.27 B: um 

45.86 48.63 B: my ah my brother and sister 

49.29 54.74 B: are not living where i do but in spite of that um 

56.01 58.26 B: we're still incredibly close 

58.32 63.13 B: and we always have been and i've always felt very fortunate that was the case 

63.07 65.41 A: (( very close contact both ah using mail and um visiting each )) 

63.29 64.02 B: (( that )) 

65.25 68.71 B: ah roughly five hundred miles they live in florida 

68.15 69.13 A: (( other so )) 

73.63 79.40 B: (( yeah )) 

80.06 81.25 B: and um 

83.55 85.32 A: oh that's good 

86.13 100.50 A: well i have a similar situation my whole family still lives in new jersey it's not as far as yours but my whole family is in new jersey and they're at least an hour to two hours away my brother's in florida so from nazareth from pennsylvania to florida that's 

99.91 101.47 B: that's a pretty good hike 

100.87 109.66 A: that's a fly right that's a flight and that so i usually only see my brother once or twice a year but we keep in contact with cell phones 

102.35 103.10 B: yeah 

109.78 111.09 A: and e-mail 

111.39 118.94 A: is a great way to keep contact with with your family which is i think also important too because that's the only that you know what's going on with everybody 

119.09 123.21 B: exact with a- and if you happen to be fortunate enough to 

125.08 128.73 B: have a close family you want to know those things i do 

127.39 128.31 A: right 

128.42 129.51 A: right 

128.89 134.61 B: and um i think it's an important thing ah i can recall once as a youngster 

135.40 139.43 B: giving my mother a little bit of grief because she didn't have more children 

139.48 140.61 B: (( and )) 

141.53 156.33 B: i can also recall her looking at me as if i really didn't know what i was talking about [laughter] 'cause it wasn't me having the babies and it wasn't me that had the responsibility the awesome responsibility of raising them but nevertheless ah 

146.28 147.56 A: (( [laughter] yeah [laughter] )) 

148.33 149.48 A: (( that's right )) 

157.31 158.63 B: (( um )) 

158.75 162.45 B: it was just something that i felt at the time and and ah 

163.69 166.29 B: just lucky to have the family i do 

166.11 178.05 A: right i agree i'm lucky also to have my my extended family which are my aunts my uncles my cousins we try to get together as much as possible even when say my daughter receives communion this year 

178.06 188.66 A: so it was never even a thought that i would invite as much of my family as i could to come and now the same thing comes down to everyone lives in new jersey so 

183.11 184.25 B: of course 

188.60 200.10 A: it's a travel for them to have to come but it's it's just so wonderful when they can all do it and we can all get together and have such a good time with each other even though we haven't seen each other as much as we would have liked to 

200.54 205.60 B: well there's the ah cliche that absence makes the heart grow fonder and ah 

204.30 205.78 A: [laughter] that's right 

205.98 212.02 B: in the case of ah some families i think that is the case is that you you ah you 

212.76 215.24 B: put more um more 

215.34 216.83 B: emphasis 

217.49 221.98 B: on being together when you have those rare moments that you are together 

221.38 222.31 A: right 

222.09 223.10 B: (( ah )) 

223.57 229.14 B: say my family used to live here but for various reasons both my sister and my brother 

229.15 229.97 B: (( ah )) 

230.28 232.22 B: moved back to florida 

231.68 232.67 A: mhm 

232.48 234.03 B: (( and ah )) 

235.23 236.13 B: um 

236.70 245.22 B: i know it was a sad day when when my brother left town and as i say there are there are ways to stay in touch if you permit distance 

240.04 241.11 A: right 

245.52 246.55 B: to 

247.52 248.84 B: um 

249.35 252.89 B: disturb what is a good healthy relationship ah 

253.15 255.06 B: you've got a problem [laughter] 

254.44 259.97 A: that's right right you you can't use distance as an excuse not to stay in contact with someone 

257.93 259.10 B: no no 

259.11 269.23 B: exactly not at all because 'cause there are too many ways to break down that that geographic distance and ah 

259.98 261.15 A: right it's 

269.92 272.26 B: to stay in 

272.34 274.88 B: contact with people that you care about 

274.50 275.76 A: right 

276.49 277.88 B: now um 

278.71 279.55 B: ah 

278.97 281.00 A: yeah that's very important 

280.32 284.19 B: oh well i think it is ah and try to pursue 

285.04 287.36 B: you know make a conscious effort to 

287.88 289.40 B: to find out what's 

289.74 292.02 B: going on even though i'm not there 

291.42 294.18 A: right and what everyone is up to 

294.32 297.33 B: that's right and ah last year 

298.76 300.85 B: as i said to my sister 

301.07 302.45 B: i said we just 

302.54 304.22 B: (( ah became orphans )) 

304.45 305.27 A: oh 

304.79 312.01 B: because ah my father had died when we were all fairly young i was only seventeen 

309.73 310.63 A: mhm 

311.98 324.17 B: and then when my mother died of course we had no parents at that point we were technically orphans and ah it's it's strange feeling knowing that that what was the 

316.06 316.71 A: [mn] 

324.31 326.97 B: foundation of your family 

327.72 329.40 B: is no longer there 

329.30 330.31 A: right 

329.75 331.01 B: um 

331.34 334.52 B: it left all of us feeling a little bit ah 

334.94 345.10 B: disjointed and that's not to say that that it hurt our relationship but but it did alter the relationship because what was once the 

345.59 347.41 B: foundation of your family 

347.78 348.69 B: is gone 

348.60 349.46 A: right 

349.28 354.52 B: so you you sort of view family i think in a slightly different light once the 

355.54 356.90 B: foundation 

355.99 356.55 A: (( [mn] )) 

356.67 359.03 A: right when the foundation is no longer there 

358.30 360.23 B: yeah is no longer there 

359.63 362.87 A: right but it's but an important part about that is that 

362.92 368.59 A: you you try to follow along in what they have done and keep it together as much as you can 

368.29 369.88 B: oh exactly 

369.11 378.36 A: like i know that when when my grandmother passed away a couple of years ago and my father and my aunt and uncle have done the best that they can to make sure the family still gets together on holidays 

378.77 386.76 A: keeps in contact and keeps in touch with each other as best as they can even though like you said the person possible for bringing it all together is no longer there 

386.59 391.57 B: that's right and and you do ah continue the process on ah 

391.79 392.99 B: (( and ah )) 

394.15 395.78 A: you do the best that you can [laughter] 

394.56 399.22 B: you know in yeah well in my case too i'm i'm my mother's boy 

399.02 399.83 A: right 

399.72 401.27 B: i have ah 

401.89 406.47 B: some of what i view as her very good qualities but i also have some ah 

407.12 409.93 B: some qualities that are ah 

410.20 411.75 B: not so good 

411.17 412.15 A: right 

412.01 415.10 B: and i recognize um 

415.20 416.94 B: some of my mother 

416.61 417.84 A: mhm 

418.01 419.41 B: in the 

419.45 422.18 B: the somewhat less desirable 

422.93 426.33 B: aspects of things that i see in myself but 

426.65 429.87 B: yeah it was probably ten or fifteen years ago 

430.97 432.96 B: i ah wrote her a letter 

433.36 434.80 B: and um 

436.19 439.53 B: i didn't really thank her that much for ah 

439.59 447.11 B: the fact that there was a roof over my head and the fact there was food on the table i never knew what hunger was 

447.83 450.93 B: um i thanked her for teaching me to read 

450.35 451.39 A: mhm 

451.41 452.72 B: because 

453.01 463.50 B: as a youngster that was emphasized and it's been a lifelong gift that that was passed along and it still is i'm 

463.89 465.16 B: still a 

466.21 468.19 B: fairly serious reader 

468.15 469.09 A: right 

468.51 476.22 B: and it's that that is that has been passed along and and it continues to live even after the death of the 

476.27 479.99 B: head of the family more or less well she was the head of the family 

479.38 480.25 A: right 

480.66 483.03 B: oldest living person anyway 

482.76 483.66 A: right 

484.18 488.87 A: yeah it's it's it's never easy when when you lose someone older or younger 

488.99 494.52 A: in a family it's just it's just hard to to to try to remember things 

494.97 495.77 A: (( that )) 

495.81 500.11 A: they instilled well it's not hard to try and remember it's important to remember 

499.59 501.71 B: i think it's important exactly 

500.31 503.09 A: to think right it's important to remember 

501.94 506.19 B: exactly and i thought it was important to say those things to 

506.77 512.29 B: you know to my mother because i knew she wasn't going to live forever ah and ah 

509.18 510.07 A: right 

512.68 519.62 B: she passed this you know along to her children and ah it has made a difference in the quality of life 

520.14 521.45 B: i think 

520.83 521.90 A: mhm 

521.75 527.95 B: um and it's it's it's just an important thing so family is ah is ah 

529.03 531.15 A: very it's it's very important 

530.74 535.77 B: yeah it's just ah i don't know i've always felt blessed you know very fortunate to 

535.88 541.27 A: yeah i have too i have always felt that i've been really fortunate t- to be given 

541.35 544.64 A: who i have you know how they say that you can't pick your family 

544.25 547.20 B: no well that's right you don't have much choice 

544.98 551.26 A: but i think that if if if i would have if i would have been looking at the people that i have in my family i probably would have picked them anyway 

551.69 556.53 B: oh yeah i would have yeah definitely oh yeah for sure 

551.88 554.30 A: th- there's just so many things 

554.56 559.74 A: you know there's just so many things that we like to do together and you know w-we can like 

559.88 566.99 A: we can come to see each other after not seeing each other for months and still feel as comfortable as if they just left the house yesterday 

565.32 565.88 B: (( [mn] )) 

566.93 568.55 B: right ah 

567.78 571.61 A: and you know it's like it- the separation is there but 

571.65 573.36 A: it's not always there 

573.98 574.82 A: that 

574.00 579.48 B: well yeah it's it's geographic and and if if 

576.50 578.03 A: right and that's it 

579.75 585.46 B: if it's only limited to geography then your family is psychologically with you 

585.12 586.13 A: right 

585.84 586.89 B: um 

586.93 593.47 B: i know that i played in a band with my brother we're both ah musicians and ah 

593.48 595.25 B: you know when i do go down 

596.11 599.83 B: ah home to visit my family i at
