99.13 104.85 B: yes my son is in fourth grade he just did a report on another city in texas 

104.60 114.28 A: it's so much easier 'cause i remember in elementary school when we wanted to write about another ci- city we'd always write to like the chamber of commerce of that city for them to write back and give us information 

105.27 106.29 B: and 

114.12 125.30 B: yeah and hope you got it back in time for the report yeah well that was what was so great i sit down there and showed him how to to find the chamber of commerce and that's what he did he emailed them

135.59 136.77 A: oh i 

136.88 142.54 A: we live off email and when i was um i'm stay at home now i'm a stay at home mom but when i was working 

142.49 153.73 A: i wouldn't even ever see my boss except for email that's how we correspond and so yeah i mean it's so impersonal now but you get a lot more i mean a lot more information a lot faster 

145.17 147.01 B: mhm yeah [laughter] 

153.48 155.26 B: right exactly 

155.25 157.07 A: [laughter]

163.96 166.38 A: oh yeah yeah that's just standard 

166.34 169.95 B: yeah and i think it's a good thing 

170.03 171.63 A: i do too i mean 

170.52 172.03 B: i really do uh-huh 

171.75 173.87 A: it's really evolved into 

174.16 182.42 A: wow you can even i couldn't even imagine ten years ago what it'd be you know computers would be so dominant now and what you get and what you use them for 

182.49 187.77 B: right and they almost have to teach it in school because it's a common everyday thing now 

187.58 189.67 A: oh yeah absolutely 

189.30 193.24 B: it's just something that it just is a part of your life now so 

193.47 197.71 A: abs- and you know they do they do a lot of classes for you know 

197.94 202.41 A: older seniors and elderly people because it's such a way of life that 

202.54 210.02 A: you know oh email how what's you know how do i do that and to even yeah a sixth grader it's like common knowledge 

209.28 217.66 B: mm right that's how my parents are we keep saying why don't you guys get the internet you know [laughter] we can email these to they live in missouri 

217.40 218.27 A: (( oh okay )) 

217.86 222.79 B: like we can email these pictures to you and well we don't know anything about it 

220.09 221.19 A: [laughter] 

223.33 231.18 B: and my dad's sister he tells she told him she says it's because you don't want to know you don't want to learn [laughter] 

228.40 229.16 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

229.47 243.56 A: [laughter] yeah well that's the nice thing about with my parents they're you know back in nebraska and and i have two small girls and so i you know we always email pictures and and that sort of thing and it's you keep in touch a lot easier 

240.79 242.57 B: yeah 

243.72 248.61 B: yeah i think it's great we've i also have a daughter that's she's just turned one 

249.03 253.33 B: and we were looking on there for um games for her 

253.80 258.80 B: and she has just like in the last month has gone from the keyboard banging 

253.81 254.82 A: oh yeah 

258.89 261.85 B: to where she knows how to grab the mouse 

261.86 265.33 B: and she's learning how to move it around you know [laughter] 

263.23 267.67 A: [laughter] see i'm afraid to do that with rose my two year old [laughter] 

266.60 274.21 B: yeah well i tell you the big drawback is she wants on the computer all the time [laughter] 

272.98 274.61 A: (( yeah i bet )) 

274.74 284.45 A: 'cause i 'cause i we're all my husband's in he's getting his masters and so he's doing his homework all the time on the computer and i'm alw- i research i look up i read a lot 

284.61 286.37 B: oh i do too uh-huh 

285.73 288.59 A: on the computer look up stuff and research and 

288.74 294.35 A: and i've learned so much i just i'm like a sponge for learning different things and 

293.72 296.70 B: oh i understand completely [laughter] 

296.46 302.88 A: you know i've learned oh especially with my you know my last pregnancy i was on there just reading about you know dulas and 

302.72 317.70 A: all sorts of things and now i want to become a dula so i'm like doing all my research on the internet and i'm just learning so much and i'm really glad it's for me being a stay at home mom it's great to have that source of you know 

307.63 308.95 B: yeah 

317.30 318.31 B: mhm 

318.08 320.94 A: for me it's my education almost [laughter] 

320.27 322.38 B: right right exactly 

322.23 323.03 A: so 

322.79 329.31 B: yeah we kinda debated about putting her up there and seeing what she could do but ah 

328.86 333.17 A: there's a web site called knee bouncers dot com that is great for toddlers 

332.94 333.89 B: really 

333.52 340.28 A: yeah knee bouncers dot com they like go on there and they like when they hit the keyboard and stuff like that it makes music or whatever and 

340.49 345.41 A: it's really fun and [laughter] so their banging is actually doing something [laughter] 

344.52 346.61 B: uh-huh right right [laughter] 

346.77 356.27 B: yeah that's kinda how these little software programs that we found ah for her are there's you know whatever key she hits will do something else and 

355.68 359.60 A: i go to nic junior a lot too because there's little games on there that they can play 

359.36 363.29 B: yes yes that's my fourth grader nic junior all the way 

362.70 363.76 A: oh yeah 

363.80 368.63 A: my daughter's just used the computer she's like dora dora [laughter] 

367.37 368.59 B: yeah 

368.66 369.85 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

370.55 371.64 B: (( [cough] )) 

372.06 376.82 A: oh it's like yeah education and computers go in hand in hand i think 

376.71 380.91 B: i do too nowadays they almost have to there's just now way around it 

379.34 380.25 A: (( yeah )) 

380.74 384.68 A: oh yeah i just think i mean in the classroom i mean students can 

384.73 391.37 A: [noise] there's one class that was going and and being email pen pals with people over in kuwait you know and it's 

391.91 394.43 A: not just that's really neat to have that 

393.90 398.00 B: uh-huh yeah well i'll tell you another big thing that i think is great where 

398.22 400.80 B: my my two older ones um 

401.51 413.54 B: if they can go to the library and look things up or if we can do it at home for the reports and things i don't have to drag my one year old to the library and disrupt everybody at the library while we're looking through encyclopedias 

405.41 407.66 A: yeah oh yeah 

412.90 420.26 A: no kidding [laughter] i i know when i was in high school though in my senior year there was a lot of problems with plagiarism and the internet 

413.61 415.15 B: (( you know [laughter] )) 

420.03 421.08 B: yes 

420.42 424.18 A: because teachers don't really have a resource to know if that's actual plag- 

424.08 436.09 A: plagiarism because you know before computers it was easy to [mn] super easy to know whether it was they were copying it right out of a book but now the resources are so unlimited that i know that's been a big problem in high school 

425.27 426.20 B: uh-huh 

435.95 438.58 B: yeah i bet that is 

437.75 438.80 A: but i think 

439.32 443.83 A: the the positive outweighs the the negative by far 

444.32 449.52 B: yeah and i know too on the plagiarism thing we always had to write down our source exactly 

449.16 450.60 A: oh yeah 

449.75 451.85 B: so the teacher could go back 

451.61 452.87 A: yeah 

452.17 459.11 B: and i think you know maybe if they kinda still pushed that a little bit like my sixteen year old you know if they would have to write down the web site 

456.65 457.70 A: mhm 

459.02 470.65 A: they do they have a they have the in the english in how you write some of the reports the little booklets i can't i can't remember what it's called but they have the exact way of how to resource the web site or 

459.17 460.36 B: you know uh-huh 

471.03 472.66 A: (( you know to write it down )) 

473.30 474.06 A: so 

473.41 481.58 B: yeah so maybe i don't know i agree with you though i just think that there's probably just almost no way to 

481.92 487.98 B: you know for the teacher to go check every single little report and but still i think it's a good thing 

484.26 486.86 A: oh yeah yeah 

489.13 490.60 A: definitely 

490.86 497.90 A: [sigh] and i overall you know it's great just having that resource the internet to you know with my parents that's just a big thing 

498.55 499.53 B: yeah 

499.06 500.86 A: keeping in touch with them better 

500.62 510.81 B: yeah we use it for everything just like my son just got a burn on his leg the other day you know and looked that up on the internet well i decided okay he really needs to go to the doctor 

502.78 504.15 A: mhm 

510.19 513.91 A: [laughter] i do that all the time if i'm sick i'm like okay 

511.25 512.33 B: (( and it )) 

513.95 520.96 B: [laughter] and we're new to this area and i didn't know where the children's hospital was where the doctor had told me to take him 

515.34 516.15 A: [laughter] 

519.03 519.98 A: mm 

520.99 528.25 B: so what'd i do i sat down on the computer and brought up map quest you know [laughter] okay now i know where i'm going 

524.30 525.20 A: [laughter] 

525.98 526.90 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

529.18 530.20 B: so it's 

531.40 532.65 B: it's a good thing 

532.71 534.15 A: sure definitely 

533.16 536.87 B: i think we keep straying from education but i i think it's all tied in 

536.74 537.75 A: yeah oh 

538.28 545.23 A: 'cause you learn so much with the internet and that's you know part educating yourself and learning the different things and keep 

545.26 546.18 A: um 

546.50 553.97 A: keeping an open mind and i think the more you learn i mean learning you learn every day and that's part of educating yourself 

553.93 555.02 B: right 

557.81 563.13 A: um mm it seems like the ten minutes is probably almost up [laughter] 

562.68 566.60 B: yeah [laughter] probably close to i know sometimes is this your first call 

566.15 567.40 A: no i 

566.66 567.51 B: no 

567.73 569.77 A: gosh i've had several 

569.20 577.20 B: really well this is only my third but it still it seems like even the first two you'd just get warmed up to the topic and that little tone comes on 

570.05 570.97 A: (( yeah )) 

575.70 576.55 A: [laughter] 

577.15 582.06 A: oh i was afraid i'd really kinda get into it start talking about something and then get that beep 

577.38 578.46 B: (( [laughter] )) 

581.97 583.55 B: yeah 

583.14 588.27 A: so but i've been so tired lately too so i don't even know how coherent i am 

588.12 590.81 B: [laughter] very you're very coherent 

590.84 594.00 B: much more than the last woman i talked to [laughter] 

592.55 593.58 A: [laughter] 

594.43 597.79 A: oh i've had some interesting people too [laughter] 

597.49 598.79 B: yeah 

598.78 599.89 A: (( mm ))
