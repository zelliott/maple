0.48 1.66 A: hi 

1.65 2.74 B: hi 

2.65 3.72 A: um 

3.81 5.51 A: i'm my name's kevin 

5.59 6.98 B: um luka 

6.94 7.97 A: (( how are you doing )) 

7.84 9.08 B: i'm good 

9.64 12.46 A: um yeah so 

12.50 15.26 B: so are we supposed to talk about computers and education 

14.86 16.57 A: yeah 

15.76 17.91 B: okay um 

18.29 21.36 A: what first first impression good or bad 

21.51 24.15 B: first impression good 

24.72 25.74 A: i agree 

25.71 27.08 B: okay why 

27.34 41.72 A: well because i think it's it's a good way to entertain the classroom um you know there's a lot of things that can be ease taught more easily using the computer um you know for people who are more visual in- you know there's better graphic models using computer than you know just drawing on the chalk board or something 

30.73 31.97 B: mhm 

41.54 42.52 B: mhm 

42.38 49.51 A: and for students that have like disabilities and stuff you know maybe computers you know for hearing impaired people or something like that it 

49.73 50.76 A: would be easier 

50.03 51.72 B: absolutely sure 

52.15 53.06 A: what about you 

53.11 59.63 B: well i think it also levels the playing field in a lot of ways because you can actually get the resources get the computers in the classrooms 

59.53 68.80 B: ah you can get information into say inner city classrooms that might not otherwise get there um international news um science 

64.63 65.42 A: (( ah )) 

68.93 73.59 B: you know that that will not necessarily be brought there by educators 

73.08 74.08 A: very true 

73.85 76.95 B: you know with who has less experience yeah 

75.91 78.28 A: kind of spreads the resources across the country too 

78.20 79.56 B: exactly 

79.87 81.19 B: exactly 

81.59 82.45 B: (( you know )) 

83.24 88.38 B: but then the other side of it [laughter] you can't always get computers into this classroom yeah 

87.50 90.04 A: that's true yeah and it's very expensive 

90.04 93.19 B: very expensive mhm yeah 

91.13 92.02 A: so 

93.16 94.83 A: what about in higher education 

95.47 101.47 B: higher education oh gosh it's getting ridiculous they're they're telling people to show up with laptops you know 

98.04 99.30 A: (( [laughter] )) 

100.95 108.20 A: yeah but then you show up with a laptop in class and you spend the whole time talking as a messenger and not actually paying attention to the teacher 

101.75 103.35 B: yeah i mean 

106.77 110.90 B: [laughter] are you a student 

108.35 109.24 A: (( you know )) 

110.91 113.86 A: am i a student yeah 

111.76 112.69 B: yeah 

112.81 120.47 B: [laughter] okay yeah it's a bit it's a bit um we weren't doing that when when i was there but yeah that's what i hear 

120.51 121.72 A: yeah i mean 

120.90 122.40 B: yeah if that's what happens 

122.15 134.47 A: so much goes on on the computer now that you know i can't go a single day without turning my computer on because i'll miss whatever's going on you know but to me you know teachers are assigning things on line and having to take tests on line and stuff 

126.77 127.72 B: mhm 

129.10 130.27 B: exactly 

134.32 135.37 B: mhm 

134.39 141.53 A: to you know just emails and stuff i mean i if i don't check my email for two hours i i miss things going on 

141.73 142.92 A: (( so you know )) 

142.02 145.79 B: oh exactly right i mean when was the last time you got a call from a professor 

145.29 147.93 A: yeah no never never happens 

146.66 147.84 B: mhm 

147.92 149.04 B: exactly 

149.44 150.95 A: and i mean you know 

151.06 159.45 A: too much time on your computer you know it's like eighty degrees and sunny outside but you have to be stuck inside checking emails and you know doing things on line which is you know 

156.46 157.64 B: mhm 

159.46 161.47 A: it's a it's kind of a waste kind of 

161.88 169.43 A: well it might help with the education aspect it kind of ties you down and chains you to something and makes you your eyes bug out from staring at the computer screen all day 

164.04 165.06 B: mhm 

168.87 180.02 B: [laughter] you can say that yeah but how much time do you actually spend working on the computer and how much do you spend you know just talking with people or or looking up things that really have nothing to do with your classes 

178.77 188.87 A: see yeah well that too but you know the more they bring into the computer the more time you're going to waste time you know playing computer games or whatever you know playing solitaire on the computer 

180.77 181.59 B: yeah 

184.45 185.59 B: yeah 

186.73 187.66 B: yeah 

188.84 200.17 B: well what about that what about keeping kids from accessing things that they shouldn't be accessing on on you know the internet in class even if it's not you know not like pornography or anything like that necessarily even just computer games 

199.85 209.09 A: yeah because there's so many so many different things like there's there's nothing there's no programme you can get to block kids from playing you know shock wave video games or something on line 

208.30 210.28 B: (( exactly exactly )) 

209.14 211.40 A: yeah yeah it's got a point i mean 

212.41 218.28 A: unrestrained use of the internet or of computers in the classroom probably wouldn't benefit anyone 

218.35 219.20 B: mhm 

218.55 221.56 A: um and that really you know has to be carefully considered and stuff 

221.79 228.46 A: i mean you know when i was in like you know grade school and stuff computers were like just coming out you know 

221.90 222.88 B: (( mhm )) 

228.53 234.48 A: like we had the old like the apple two es all through like seventh grade you know and then 

232.37 233.65 B: (( [laughter] yeah yeah )) 

233.67 234.59 B: yeah 

234.55 240.11 A: um i mean i'm sure it's a lot different now my mom's an elementary school teacher in her classroom they've got you know 

240.10 253.38 A: i remember like when i went to school she teaches at the school i went to when i was there there was one room and it had like fifteen computers in it now she has six computers just in her classroom and they're all they're all hooked up to the internet and the kids spend so much time on them and stuff 

248.99 250.03 B: wow 

253.47 254.69 A: so it's kind of 

253.80 256.54 B: oh that must make her life so much easier 

256.27 261.92 A: it does in some ways um keeps the kids occupied and stuff but i mean i don't know 

260.24 261.16 B: (( mhm )) 

262.57 267.21 A: it kind of takes a different type of teacher to use the computers a lot too you know 

266.61 273.21 B: as i say yeah somebody has to teach the teachers how to use the computers especially when you deal with a lot of 'em or you know 

269.52 271.71 A: yeah yeah exactly 

273.25 278.69 B: a lot of them older you know may be even those to retirement aren't necessarily interested in learning the new technology 

277.85 282.93 A: exactly and it's also kind of hard to incorporate the technology in two traditional classroom settings 

282.79 284.06 B: mhm 

283.03 285.06 A: you know because [cough] there's 

285.19 288.66 A: there's only so many ways you can you can you know 

288.90 298.54 A: use the computer in math class when you're teaching multiplication you know if you're using the computer too much you know you are going to get kids addicted to their calculators like they can't do simple math in their heads 

292.53 293.67 B: right 

298.56 300.04 B: exactly 

299.20 307.89 A: so there's you know i mean maybe using a computer takes away from you know human intelligence it it bases too much on artificial intelligence 

305.05 306.53 B: mhm 

307.79 309.70 B: or practical application 

309.40 310.31 A: right 

310.10 317.00 B: mhm mhm and that's to going to be harmful even just in in terms of the institutions that are already in place things like the s._a._t. where 

316.92 325.75 B: i think you can use actually i'm not sure if you can use a calculator on s._a._t. any more but i know you can't use it on your ah g._r._e. or g. maths when you get to that level and stuff 

323.75 324.79 A: right 

324.97 326.21 A: yeah 

326.14 327.18 B: (( and )) 

326.90 339.48 A: i mean they have calculators now like the the newest level of calculator i mean i- there's no point in having a class in multi variable calculus when you can just type it in into your into your um calculator and it does it for you 

339.51 340.73 B: exactly 

339.54 347.44 A: you know i mean when you can't have hal- have calculators they can do that high level of math it almost makes math class obsolete 

344.24 344.99 B: right 

347.03 347.88 B: (( mm )) 

347.49 348.37 A: which 

348.46 351.74 A: but at the same time if you don't teach math you don't teach people how to think 

351.76 352.66 A: (( you know )) 

352.15 352.89 B: right 

352.87 354.39 A: so it's kind of a 

354.92 357.11 B: well they miss the general concept 

356.90 360.59 A: right sure they can type but that's not what we're going for 

360.26 361.32 B: mhm 

360.71 361.54 A: (( you know )) 

361.53 365.11 B: mhm they don't even really need to memorize formulas any more 

364.82 366.74 A: right they can just type everything in 

366.80 367.81 B: exactly 

367.67 379.72 A: i mean you know i've taken classes where you know i think you know some people haven't understood but they can still do okay because they can type things into their calculator you know and come up with answers that are close or whatever 

377.04 378.06 B: mhm 

379.40 380.33 B: mhm 

380.76 381.56 B: yeah 

382.02 387.45 B: yeah i know it helps kids with learning disabilities so i actually work in a school 

387.72 395.76 B: and that's one of the things i do is um try to purchase software for our kids with um dyslexia in particular 

395.40 404.01 A: oh wow that's really interesting um i know my my mom had a student who had um like a muscular disorder 

397.12 398.02 B: yeah 

403.92 404.74 B: (( ah mhm )) 

403.93 411.49 A: um so he couldn't write um but they got actually got some computers and stuff so that he could type everything on the computer 

411.73 422.77 A: um so it it was really interesting they like got him a special keyboard and stuff that the keys are really far apart so that he didn't need precise movements he just used more general mom- movements to type in stuff 

416.41 417.32 B: wow 

422.26 423.85 B: oh that's really cool 

423.23 426.17 A: yeah it was really interesting and you know 

426.43 437.60 A: any- anyone else would have written it off as a kid who you know i mean it's too bad but he's never going to get far in life but you know they're given the opportunity to show that he can you know write papers and he can 

432.74 434.00 B: mhm 

437.54 442.54 A: you know make intelligent additions to the classroom despite his disability 

438.75 439.76 B: (( exactly and he can )) 

440.85 444.73 B: be yeah and he can be yeah he can be in the classroom 

444.32 446.00 A: right 

445.17 447.69 B: (( right which is a big change )) 

446.06 452.38 A: he doesn't have to be in a special classroom you know he doesn't have to be in a group of all you know special needs kids or whatever 

448.02 449.34 B: exactly 

451.86 452.86 B: mhm 

452.55 457.54 A: and i think you know that immersing them in the general population 

457.60 460.73 A: of computers would definitely aid that in many ways 

460.89 462.13 B: absolutely 

462.93 463.90 B: (( absolutely )) 

465.47 470.18 B: i don't know i don't know if they need the internet in classrooms necessarily you know 

469.89 471.13 A: yeah 

470.54 471.45 B: i mean 

471.90 480.78 B: that seems to be the big push it's not just to get the the computers in the classrooms necessarily but to get them them hooked up immediately everybody wants to do 

478.63 479.74 A: yeah 

480.48 481.41 A: i don't 

481.39 495.53 A: i don't necessarily see you know they are like oh it's this vast information network and you can get so much well i mean not really i mean you can get the information but there's not anything on it you couldn't get by going to a library you know 

489.45 490.42 B: yeah 

494.99 496.36 B: exactly 

495.62 497.33 A: i mean it's not 

497.88 509.39 A: i don't really see how that enhances the learning environment i mean yeah it's easier to do research and stuff on line than it is in a library but why not why do they need that in every classroom you know 

501.12 502.05 B: mhm 

508.36 514.14 B: right right or else we're going to wind up with you know whole generations of kids who don't know how to use the library 

513.64 520.83 A: yeah i mean i already know knows how to use it with the dewey decimal system you know like people are like card catalogue what's a card catalogue 

517.24 519.12 B: [laughter] 

520.36 522.47 B: [laughter] exactly 

520.87 522.70 A: you know i mean and i mean 

523.03 526.17 A: ten years down the road my kids won't remember you know 

525.60 526.57 B: mhm 

526.65 536.98 B: exactly and that there's no way we're going to be able to get everything on line so there will be just volumes and volumes and volumes of information that will just be missed it just won't be out there 

534.74 536.50 A: yeah 

536.98 538.92 A: no one will bother with it any more 

538.13 540.38 B: exactly exactly 

539.77 550.28 A: you know like if i'm writing a paper and i can get you know these articles on line but then these i have to go to the library and get i'll just skip the ones i have to go get you know i'll just use the ones on line because i don't have to go to the library you 

547.75 549.09 B: mhm 

550.27 551.57 B: exactly 

550.99 553.40 A: mean i mean it kind of 

553.63 556.81 A: (( i don't know it would almost kind of impede progress in the classroom )) 

556.95 558.63 B: (( mhm yeah right )) 

558.87 565.91 B: yeah what about plagiarism we get we actually had a case of that originally yeah what were you going to say 

561.97 563.80 A: but yeah i was just 

565.34 576.80 A: i was just i i thought of that but i'd forgotten um i mean they make it so much easier when you can like pay you know ten bucks to download a paper off the internet and just never even have to do it 

574.28 575.15 B: mhm 

576.26 577.39 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

576.76 582.48 A: you know and it's really untraceable you know i mean how would anyone find out you know 

579.95 581.20 B: pretty much 

582.48 594.98 B: yeah look the only way we found out actually was that the kid was was just obviously not that brilliant and and put the site where he'd gotten the information in his bibliography [laughter] 

592.67 596.51 A: and he yeah checked it out and it was all right there 

595.46 599.89 B: and there it was yeah but if you don't do that i mean no i mean i don't see
