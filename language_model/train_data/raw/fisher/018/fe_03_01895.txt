13.11 16.29 B: good right we're talking on families 

16.49 30.79 A: yes i'm having major family drama because i was an only child and i am getting married and so i have inherited two elderly parents and um some very vindictive brothers 

26.24 27.41 B: oh my 

30.87 32.46 A: and uh 

32.64 44.82 A: uh it's just difficult because this is his second marriage as is mine but i didn't have these issues because i didn't have any siblings and i certainly didn't have an ex-husband or children or any of that to deal with 

44.63 47.59 B: so your definition of family is getting ready to change 

47.45 50.77 A: yes it is getting ready to change 

50.04 60.36 B: in a big fashion gracious well i my family was you know i have a sister um we're all very close knit we live close together so when h- when i married i 

60.22 69.86 B: had um he had a brother and a sister and they still live near by his mother lives near by so we're all didn't have any major issues with family there um 

69.89 71.77 A: did you marry when you were younger 

71.34 75.11 B: i was twenty one when i married so and it is my first 

72.63 73.66 A: okay 

75.09 79.25 B: marriage and it is sixteen years now um almost seventeen um 

79.16 90.35 B: so i don't have that second family issue although my sister who married a second time and it's her husbands third time and he had grown children and not quite grown children and she had young children so [mn] 

89.18 92.74 A: wow how did that mix that's real family mix 

92.12 98.87 B: yeah it it's most everybody has been acc- has accepted my sister um 

98.03 98.99 A: mhm 

98.98 103.03 B: the oldest daughter is like twenty five now um she still 

103.61 114.01 B: has a hard time with it um but they fortunately they don't all live near by they live miles and miles and miles away so they don't have to see each other on a regular basis 

113.36 126.07 A: yeah he has the same kind of situation my uh husband to be has two daughters who are in their twenties and and i don't know if they're traumatically effected or if they just decided to take up their mothers crusade 

125.67 126.93 B: right 

125.98 131.45 A: but uh they're really giving him a hard time complete with major college debts 

131.86 135.07 A: and paying off all of her other debt 

134.96 147.87 A: and giving her the house and giving her money out of pension and it's really been quite traumatic they're they're also vindictive just in the way they communicate or rather don't communicate with him 

146.97 148.06 B: mhm 

147.91 155.51 A: the latest one has has decided to have a wedding ceremony so she sent him an invitation with the day and a time cut out 

155.69 157.40 A: so he has no way of knowing 

156.86 159.21 B: oh my gracious 

158.57 169.61 A: which which i cur- personally didn't understand because she didn't invite him as dad to come to the wedding uh she asked him to cater and serve at the wedding 

164.91 165.91 B: right 

169.58 176.06 A: because he's a cook so she asked him to cater and to serve and uh and of course to have me come along 

172.90 174.07 B: wow 

176.40 181.05 A: and cater and serve and he said nope i just want to be dad i'll pay for it catering 

180.58 181.73 B: that's right 

181.01 193.42 A: i'll do whoever you like but i'm not comfortable being in my old house with my ex-wife and my new wife to be all under the same roof they don't get along and it's not going to work and this is your day 

193.85 194.84 A: so she 

194.14 195.55 B: that was very smart 

195.17 200.25 A: so she stormed out of his office and said i never want to talk to you again and that was almost a year ago 

200.03 201.14 B: oh wow 

200.34 207.43 A: and then the invitation showed up so i'm learning a lot about this about how family are the first people that will hurt you 

207.07 209.13 B: right you are exactly right 

209.05 221.26 A: but i learned that also from my own up bringing from my family and i have always kept by distance with family and creating my own family my own world of friends and people that i like to be around 

212.87 213.92 B: mhm 

215.52 216.58 B: the family 

221.36 226.86 A: but this is this family dynamic of feeling like it's okay to mistreat you 

226.54 227.51 B: right 

226.87 234.47 A: because your brother your blood or your indispensable because you'll only have one brother it just seems a little odd to me 

234.45 246.19 A: since i'm an only child i would think you would cherish your sibling and do you best to try and figure out how to work together especially on issues of elderly parents 

235.79 236.72 B: right 

245.43 246.39 B: right 

246.31 247.17 A: which is 

246.66 250.37 B: and i think i know in in in my particular situation 

250.65 260.28 B: i'm i'm closer to my family than i probably am to any one um and i can tell them any thing um even my aunts and uncles because we're in the south and we 

260.36 264.73 B: everybody that i consider my family lives within a twenty mile radius of each other 

264.87 266.60 B: so we're all very close 

266.38 267.60 A: that's great 

266.61 281.22 B: but but on the other token there are things that i say and do to my family that i wouldn't dare say to a co-worker or do to one of my friends um and i think it's that sounding board that we feel like okay they'll still love us and still 

275.56 276.56 A: sure 

281.53 286.16 B: care about us if we are very ugly to them just a vent 

286.44 297.11 B: where as we couldn't do that with your friends and you push your family and that hard situation because they get hurt you hurt your family not necessarily meaning to but knowing that's just a good sounding board um 

288.38 289.37 A: sure 

296.81 303.34 A: sure and i think there's a difference between a family that's supportive and understand that you're venting 

303.18 314.74 A: an a and a sibling rivalry that at fifteen was okay and at twenty five it wasn't okay but you know it was understandable but at fifty five it's just pathetic 

314.85 325.57 A: so [laughter] i'm what i am sensing and seeing from this family is that they um they very much like to stay in roles he is the youngest son 

324.44 325.69 B: mhm 

325.64 330.77 A: and and has always sort of been mistreated as the youngest 

330.78 340.27 A: and him growing up turning fifty divorcing and remarrying has thrown such a monkey wrench into the family dynamic 

339.71 340.93 B: mhm 

340.11 353.50 A: because not only is he changing to stand up for himself and to do what's right for his life which means leaving behind a psychologically strange relationship that very much emulated the family dynamic 

353.07 354.01 B: right 

353.30 357.05 A: [laughter] of course and uh so they really 

356.83 368.76 A: one it puts fear into them about the kind of person he's becoming it shows up who they are and what they settled for and number two it upsets the family dynamic because they expect 

368.69 377.42 A: not only to continue to be able to mistreat him as the youngest but now the new wife should accept the same behavior because she's the wife of the youngest 

374.89 376.02 B: right 

376.35 377.69 B: the youngest 

377.55 380.35 A: and i don't tolerate that very well 

379.93 388.62 B: yeah and you know those those roles and i think you find those in families and i guess when you look at us and other creatures of the world we're a lot like 

388.64 397.48 B: other animals that you know when you have our own little clan of people you've got that and you have got the person th- that takes care of the others and 

397.24 403.90 B: and you've got the little groups within groups that and when something up sets that balance and it's like oh something's you know 

403.94 404.97 A: yes 

404.35 412.27 B: some families can can get through that and others can't i know in my family my grand mother just died last month and oh thank you and there were 

410.75 412.51 A: i'm sorry for your loss 

412.82 415.76 B: three daughters my mother and her two sisters and 

415.98 426.12 B: they all got along but they didn't get along always and you know one was thinking the other was doing more than the other for th- you know grandmother i'm t- i'm taking on all of this weight and you're not and 

418.49 419.41 A: sure 

425.23 427.51 A: oh yeah i'm seeing a lot of that now 

427.02 430.43 B: yeah i think the death actually brought them closer 

430.50 436.31 A: well that's actually good because if there was any money involved that would of been exactly the time that it blew up 

435.59 446.66 B: right and you know my gra- grandmothers estate had been dwindled down it was never very large but because she died at home and for the last two years they have been paying sitters and 

446.42 456.18 B: medicate what paying like a thousand dollars a month and it was taking them about three thousand dollars a month to pay for round the clock um care so what money she had made and put aside 

456.04 465.83 B: dwindled down and um of course the will had pretty much established the tangible things and every thing else was split and so i mean it was never really a question they all pretty much knew 

457.17 458.13 A: sure 

466.05 475.46 B: they knew how much was there but they had taken all over her finances so that was never really an uh issue it could have been if it had been several years ago before 

474.54 486.17 A: yes i quite agree i quite agree i have parents are in their eighties and their their fairly healthy and that their all they're sort of independent we do their shopping 

485.60 486.67 B: mhm 

486.03 500.16 A: and they take care of their house they just sold their house they were very fortunate they live up here in new york in up state county in a county that seems to be wildly popular with city folks that wood stalk area so they literally sold their house in one day 

494.70 495.65 B: oh wow 

500.19 501.36 B: gracious 

500.93 503.01 A: and yeah it's pretty amazing 

502.55 504.31 B: that is phenomenal 

502.96 503.98 A: and 

503.84 512.46 A: and they sold it for about three times more than they paid for it so they're sitting on assets that their youngest son 

507.38 508.53 B: (( oh man )) 

512.25 526.59 A: the one who's always pushed aside is a financial planner so he tripled or quadrupled their savings when they retired at sixty and now he sold their house for three times more than he had it built for twenty years ago 

513.76 514.78 B: mhm 

526.39 527.53 B: gracious 

526.92 535.99 A: so now they're sitting on a really nice nest egg and they're making a choice to move out of state uh 'cause we're making the same choice 

535.57 536.54 B: right 

535.88 550.84 A: and they decided out of all of their children to move to where we're moving and it you know while it was nice we constantly made them understand they should move to where ever they want to move they have three sons pick one and move near that son 

550.70 554.71 A: there's no pressure here all that we want to make sure is that you're cared for 

554.57 559.36 A: because you can no longer live alone they don't like the word assisted living 

556.77 557.70 B: right 

558.93 560.17 B: mhm 

559.17 565.57 A: but it real truth is that they do need assistance they just don't want strangers doing it cause we do the shopping 

561.22 562.59 B: that's what they need 

563.25 564.21 B: right 

565.39 575.86 A: we check in on them occasionally we cook for them um we certainly are monitoring behaviors with medicines doctors visits and we take them to those things so 

576.36 589.77 A: it's really become quite a point of contention for them to be moving to the same place we're contemplating moving why i have no idea so the very children who claim they love their parents so much 

589.87 596.51 A: are up set with their parents and taking it out on them for moving to where we're moving which i also don't get [laughter] 

594.42 595.22 B: (( then )) 

595.81 599.90 B: that could become an issue uh you'll are taking all of all of their money
