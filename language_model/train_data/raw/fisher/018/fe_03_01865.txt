2.58 4.94 B: i'm i'm tom how are you doing 

4.57 5.79 A: (( hi i'm tanya )) 

5.83 11.10 B: this is great this is the most shiny happy topic we could have possibly been given i think 

10.58 12.82 A: that's right it's an easy topic 

12.88 19.81 B: so how's things with you we're i suppose we're supposed to talk about family you want to start or shall we be more polite i don't know how this thing's supposed to work so whatever 

19.14 25.77 A: i mean that's the topic but you know how this is supposed to be natural conversation so whatever questions you want to ask 

23.19 24.52 B: (( oh okay )) 

25.54 26.85 B: yeah you know i don't 

26.94 27.96 B: (( i don't know )) 

28.11 33.96 B: family's w- i i'm not around my family right now so it's tough for me to say like sometimes they're sort of irritating 

33.99 35.65 B: (( ah which is ah )) 

36.12 43.70 B: which is why i'm in puerto rico and then sometimes i miss them which is why i go back to saint louis so i don't know well 

41.77 45.31 A: right they know what buttons to push you mean when they irritate you 

45.49 53.00 B: i don't you know i mean it's just ah i mean not irritate in a bad way it's just you know i mean there there's a point in time where it's like ah 

53.35 58.06 B: oh christ i don't know they're just [mn] they talk too much most of the time actually 

57.26 65.70 A: well certain things irritate you i totally understand i had a friend and you know we were talking about this and he said you know i only have so many years with my mom 

59.03 61.19 B: [laughter] 

65.94 71.44 A: and the things she does drives me crazy but i kinda overlook them 'cause i just want to enjoy the time that i have with her 

71.84 77.49 A: and i kinda look at things like that when my mother's irritating me i think you know what i should just need to back off and just relax 

78.32 92.90 B: [laughter] i guess that makes sense my well yeah i you know for a long time i've lived with my grand- um like my grandma moved in with us after my grandpa died right [lipsmack] and so for a long time she was around like most of my growing up experience and so my mom was always the sister role kind of thing 

92.85 104.88 B: you know like we were always at each other's throats and my grandma was always kind of there like being the matronly one to both of us and like pleasant [laughter] and my dad just kind of like stood on the sidelines and like watched us argue basically so 

104.94 113.34 B: um so i don't know i don't know i guess i guess it's family's the big word that's like i don't know what about dogs do dogs figure into family 

113.19 116.18 A: mm um i think so definitely animals 

115.84 118.46 B: or cats i'm sorry i don't know you might be a cat person 

118.27 126.90 A: i don't have any animals but i grew up around animals so definitely it is i mean look how people have relationships with their animals definitely part of the family 

119.09 119.87 B: (( oh )) 

126.39 128.55 B: you know they have pet health insurance now 

128.77 130.09 A: i'm sorry you have 

129.38 131.50 B: they have health insurance for pets 

131.53 134.02 A: oh i can understand that if you're taking 

133.32 136.03 B: for turtles even though and it's all right 

135.61 138.17 A: well if you want to pay the money i'm sure someone's gonna take it 

137.75 139.47 B: [laughter] 

139.01 145.61 A: but think about how much how expensive it can be you take your animal to the vet and that little you know problem it's expensive [laughter] 

145.35 148.36 B: i guess i don't know well down here in puerto rico it's really 

148.45 153.87 B: not so difficult you just go in and they chop them up and they give them to you still sedated and ah 

153.91 161.60 B: it's not such a br- big deal but so i don't know i don't know but i i remember in the states yeah it's quite the ah quite the ordeal that's okay 

161.48 166.86 A: but stas- statistically speaking people spend more money on their pets than they do their children 

166.37 167.79 B: are you serious 

167.40 172.42 A: yes i work for a company and we had some products that were going on the market and we did some 

167.83 169.12 B: that's ridiculous 

172.54 183.21 A: major research and it's amazing i don't remember what the average cost per person but it's more than on on kids and that's including like daycare service for your children and that 

182.99 184.18 B: do you have kids 

184.09 184.84 A: no 

184.54 188.11 B: oh okay do you are you married or anything oh okay

200.14 201.05 A: (( oh that's )) 

200.63 209.76 B: but the dog tries to eat them so we have to like take preventative measures they they've never learned the lesson they still try and sneak inside and the dog still tries to eat them and they just they haven't learned it's been like three weeks 

209.47 210.54 A: a good thing 

210.38 211.48 B: yeah carrying on 

210.60 212.94 A: well now what took you to puerto rico

216.44 225.65 B: and so and it was really cheap you know i mean i priced it in the states it's like a hundred and seventy dollars a credit down here right yeah so it was like okay i can't turned that down um 

222.03 223.40 A: are you serious 

225.30 226.08 A: (( yeah )) 

226.25 231.64 B: but i have my comprehensive exams tomorrow which is why like i'm doing this because i'm trying really hard not to study for them 

231.31 233.15 A: [laughter] okay 

232.60 234.24 B: yeah it's horrifying 

234.97 249.22 B: ah so yeah that was basically it it really wasn't to get away from my rents i mean we're you know that's fine it's just like i spent you know i'm twenty six and i spent you know whatever twenty two years i guess around them and it's just ah i mean it's good to have them there i guess but ah i don't know i mean there's [mn] 

249.17 255.28 B: i'm an only child so my mother's like super oh protective stuff so 

255.24 259.73 A: well but you know i think another thing is if you want a particular behaviour out of her or a certain 

261.49 264.43 A: you have to you have to command that 

264.56 265.83 B: (( that's true i suppose )) 

266.63 268.96 B: but at some point you know um 

268.78 269.86 A: (( you have to get out of )) 

269.14 278.44 B: i have to be able to wear dirty jeans if i want to i mean that there's just there's just certain things [laughter] like i don't want to be whatever yeah whatever i mean she's great i love her but goddamn 

277.46 279.98 A: yeah but she will treat you like a child 

279.59 281.67 B: [laughter] 

280.47 282.33 A: that child parent relationship 

282.07 286.04 B: i know i guess that's the thing that's how it works yeah 

284.46 290.40 A: you never change but if you you know you have to be careful too because you could be really sensitive 

291.34 294.51 A: and then if you say the wrong thing she'll be really mad at you for a long 

295.37 297.93 B: i just think she needs a hobby that's my own personal

312.87 313.63 A: right 

313.42 320.72 B: and it's like i don't know she doesn't have a lot of friends so consequently she just has to email me like seven times a day and it's like jesus christ will you stop 

320.68 330.94 B: emailing it's and you know it's not that i don't like to hear from her like i you know i like emailing my mom it's all fun and good but it's there's never any content it's always you know like are you washing your clothes are you blah i say okay

387.13 392.31 B: and he had this quote where it said ah i watched this is like what's your key to longevity and he said well you know i watched all my friends retire 

392.13 397.12 B: and then they started playing golf and then they started playing golf and drinking and then they just stopped playing golf and started drinking 

396.95 407.61 B: and then they died and it's like i i fear the same for my dad 'cause he's starting to like drink manhattans and ah that's got me scared 'cause i don't want him to die 'cause he's you know you know you don't want them to die so 

407.17 419.60 A: yeah my mom was a teacher she retired quite young yeah she put her thirty years in and got the heck out of there and i thought you know you're too young to retire you need to do something and she was like no way i'm not going back and i'm not gonna get another job 

412.45 413.54 B: yeah
