3.36 5.47 A: hi vicki my name is lindsay 

5.07 6.34 B: hi lindsay 

5.95 7.20 A: how are you 

6.70 8.64 B: i'm fine how are you today 

8.32 12.68 A: just fine this is the first time i've participated in this have is this your first call 

11.89 13.92 B: my first call also 

13.21 19.17 A: oh right i just got an email about this from my cousin yesterday and it all came together very quickly 

18.43 21.22 B: yes it sure did i just signed up today 

20.88 22.16 A: [laughter] 

21.46 27.36 B: [laughter] so i guess i guess computers are um educational don't you think 

26.88 30.94 A: that's right that's right it's my window to the world sometimes 

27.72 29.29 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

30.22 36.81 B: [mn] oh yes definitely i use mine every day and i i think i learn something new on it every day 

37.24 39.23 A: well me too um 

38.26 39.24 B: (( [laughter] )) 

39.40 44.31 A: so i guess our topic is what computers in education i um 

44.62 49.60 A: i don't know exactly how to proceed but um i i 

48.17 49.08 B: uh-huh 

49.61 55.45 A: my thought is that they're probably talking about how it computers are used in a traditional classroom 

55.47 57.26 B: mhm yes 

55.54 62.55 A: do you think or do you think it's for how you or i might be using it on a personal basis for our you know learning as adults 

62.65 67.34 B: well i think probably both but it sounded like possibly ah 

67.50 72.25 B: in the classroom setting or some type of institu- you know educational institution 

72.27 82.95 B: so i would think i know for a fact that computers are very good for education because ah my granddaughter uses it constantly in her school work 

82.81 83.69 A: yes 

83.34 85.50 B: and it helps her quite a bit 

85.95 88.03 A: (( remind me your name again is it vicki )) 

87.52 88.92 B: vicki uh-huh 

88.15 90.84 A: vicki and it's lindsay on this end okay 

89.06 91.78 B: and lindsay okay all right 

90.94 97.12 A: it's just i always say i need a couple of times before i make the connection particularly if i meet someone in person 

93.06 94.64 B: [laughter] 

96.74 98.30 B: oh yeah 

97.67 107.04 A: you know i i generally check check um am focused on the visual first and then i need to catch the what you hear audibly 

105.37 106.25 B: uh-huh 

107.10 108.21 A: second 

108.10 109.08 B: right 

108.87 111.76 A: but anyway i guess i'm getting a little off the topic 

111.14 114.27 B: (( oh well i don't think it matters too much [laughter] )) 

112.19 117.86 A: [laughter] well you say you say you have grandchildren who are using the computer in the classroom 

117.18 121.39 B: yes i have one one granddaughter she's the sixth grader 

121.63 131.77 B: and ah she lives with me and like i say she uses the computer at school and then she comes home and uses a lot um for homework and projects and things like that 

131.14 132.79 A: yes yes 

132.00 134.39 B: mhm do you have any children 

132.93 133.83 A: well 

133.79 139.64 A: yes i do um i my son's a sophomore in high school and then our daughter is a 

137.59 138.58 B: mhm 

139.55 149.49 A: sophomore in college and when she went off to school that was one of the first things we had to do was buy her a we actually ended up getting a laptop for her to use 

140.95 142.20 B: oh okay 

145.27 146.21 B: uh-huh 

148.92 150.19 B: oh okay 

149.63 158.23 A: for her college work and and um we have we've had a desk- desktop computer at home and the kids use it an amazing amount 

155.42 156.37 B: mhm 

157.80 159.40 B: yeah yeah 

158.74 160.40 A: i know that um 

160.72 161.55 A: (( ah )) 

161.67 162.58 A: the 

162.80 177.53 A: yesterday my computer crashed on me and i had to type out everything was was gone and [laughter] i went through this long process with dell to get it reloaded i was quite nervous about it because my son has his whole portfolio 

168.60 169.53 B: uh-huh 

172.08 173.00 B: [laughter] 

177.07 178.56 B: (( oh okay )) 

177.59 182.70 A: on um on the computer here at home and he's responsible for 

182.86 185.68 A: for turning it in on friday 

185.41 186.77 B: oh goodness 

185.82 189.84 A: so i thought oh my goodness you know he's 

187.85 188.86 B: yeah 

190.16 195.60 A: fortunately we were able to recover it all without losing any information but yeah so 

192.92 195.05 B: oh well that's good that's good 

195.64 196.63 B: (( yeah the )) 

196.69 200.88 B: computers can be scary at times [laughter] 

198.49 202.42 A: i know it taught us a little lesson about making sure we back them up 

202.15 203.37 B: right 

202.40 216.49 A: but um but you know they're hav- it's been interesting to watch because i feel like my daughter now who's she's twenty and she's she's been using the computer um a little less time in school on a regular basis than my son did i think he was 

208.50 209.53 B: mhm 

216.51 221.95 A: and it sounds like your granddaughter has been using it from even an earlier age than our kids did so it's 

221.29 222.17 B: yeah 

221.96 224.46 A: something that seems to be 

225.14 231.90 A: um you know the resources and the availability of computers in the schools seems to be expanding all the time 

231.18 233.15 B: it is it really is 

233.18 236.86 B: yeah because like you said she has been using it um 

237.01 243.83 B: she's in sixth grade and i think they started like in either third or fourth grade they introduced them to computers in the classroom 

244.05 245.25 B: and um 

245.39 251.07 B: you know i mean she's a whiz at it she knows a lot more stuff than than i do [laughter] 

249.08 253.42 A: [laughter] well vicki what part of the country are you from 

252.86 256.05 B: i'm in the ah the south east i'm in georgia 

255.45 261.92 A: in georgia okay 'cause the we're i'm here in northern california and just just north of san francisco 

256.08 256.99 B: mhm 

259.54 260.72 B: oh okay 

261.54 262.84 B: oh okay 

262.16 274.26 A: so it's interesting i'm wondering i'm curious about this um you know if they're interested in matching people up from different regions of the country for you know to different you know 'cause this is a linguistics study 

269.01 269.97 B: uh-huh 

273.79 275.46 B: right right 

274.81 275.76 A: um 

276.00 276.89 B: yeah 

276.01 277.13 A: anyway 

276.92 285.57 B: i suppose so yeah i was wondering too i was just about to ask you where you were um so it's like what about a two hour difference there huh 

285.35 288.11 A: georgia and san francisco that would be three hours 

287.42 288.78 B: three hours 

288.22 292.36 A: right i'm on the west coast and there's a and you're aren't you in the eastern time zone 

289.80 290.72 B: mhm 

291.45 293.77 B: yeah the east yeah i'm on the east coast 

292.60 295.14 A: right so it's only two o'clock out here 

294.70 308.46 B: oh okay yeah it's five here [laughter] yeah this is interesting i was wondering i said i wonder how this is gonna work and you know and how can i talk to somebody for ten minutes that you know i don't know [laughter] 

296.60 298.44 A: okay okay 

307.77 318.91 A: right well i guess that's part of the study that um and that's probably why they do give us a topic as a sort of a basis for a discussion so that you know we can kind of give it a focus and ah 

310.47 311.31 B: mhm 

313.04 314.56 B: mhm 

315.26 316.36 B: right 

319.12 325.78 A: you know but it's sort of a social thing too i mean i i've been in business a lot and you know in my career and um 

323.54 324.42 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

325.75 340.11 A: you are constantly you know on the phone talking to people and and making um carving out a relationship by by just communicating primarily through the phone or perhaps using email back and forth to solidify the relationship 

328.31 329.14 B: right 

333.36 334.26 B: mhm 

337.27 338.27 B: right 

340.37 343.56 B: yeah and i just retired i was um 

343.59 345.07 B: i worked with um 

345.26 357.04 B: telecommunications for over thirty years [laughter] and i just retired last september so i'm looking for things like this to you know keep me active [laughter] 

347.57 348.78 A: oh wow 

355.25 358.02 A: yes so how did you hear about the project 

357.52 366.26 B: i i went on line and i i'm thinking i go on there so much i don't really remember exactly where it was i'm thinking it was um 

367.42 372.48 B: darn i don't even remember what database i was in and this ah came up 

372.96 378.09 B: and i said mm that sounds interesting let me just you know check it out and that was just this morning 

377.84 391.38 A: oh great and you're right on well the computer it is fun to go um surf the internet and just sort of it's serendipitous the way you can just go from one topic to another like something will trigger your mind to 

378.42 379.61 B: [laughter] 

386.05 386.88 B: mhm 

390.60 391.72 B: right 

391.25 394.96 A: wander onward i i always as a child um 

392.82 393.64 B: (( mhm )) 

394.78 408.31 A: i always loved the dictionary because i'd look up one word and then it would take me to another and and you know of course with the power of the internet um there's just so much more um available it's just mind boggling 

398.05 398.99 B: uh-huh 

402.61 403.56 B: yeah 

405.39 406.20 B: right 

407.91 408.98 B: yes 

409.00 414.28 B: and i was a little when my phone rang i looked i said ah philadelphia p. a. 

414.39 420.82 B: um now who's calling i thought it was maybe a solicitor and then i heard the little auto the robot [laughter] you know 

420.26 421.80 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

421.03 428.50 B: i said oh the calls i didn't think they would start today but um i'm glad it is this is really interesting and like you said the computer has 

428.56 436.31 B: it brings a lot of different people together it really does so it it does broaden your education whether you're in school or not 

436.42 437.85 B: (( it does )) 

437.36 443.37 A: yes and um you know particularly here in northern california where the you know the personal computer was kind of 

443.55 449.93 A: born out in silicon valley and all that um i guess they've been using them in schools for um 

445.10 446.91 B: mhm mhm right 

450.38 459.03 A: fairly early on i know steve jobes from apple computer made a big point of getting them into the educational context as early as possible 

453.51 454.33 B: uh-huh 

456.21 457.25 B: (( right yeah )) 

458.70 459.67 B: yeah 

460.12 461.21 A: um 

460.18 462.88 B: that's that's a good thing it really is mhm 

462.21 470.75 A: yes yes but um but it took a while to get up here to our schools here we're just north of san francisco and um 

468.29 469.53 B: oh okay 

470.71 479.73 A: and i think they had lots of kinda test classrooms down down around the san jose santa clair area for the kids they were really at a super advantage there for a while 

475.65 476.83 B: oh okay 

479.43 480.45 B: right 

480.74 481.66 A: (( mm )) 

481.13 488.09 B: well it's almost like i say it is in the school systems here ah not every classroom has one but um 

488.35 492.22 B: they have what they call connection classes so they get to 

492.38 498.58 B: to interact with the computer and you know that stuff all you know during the day at least once or twice a week 

498.05 499.63 A: mhm mhm 

498.65 511.44 B: ah and i think some classrooms have the computers in there so they use them on a daily basis but ah it's it's almost becoming mandatory to have a computer you know [laughter] 

509.00 522.82 A: oh i actually that now that you bring that up it's ah you know sort of a concern i have is that it might ah until it is universal in its availability it it's a situation where 

519.08 520.04 B: mhm 

522.73 528.69 A: if a a child doesn't have the advantage of of having a computer both at home and at school 

527.99 529.13 B: mhm 

528.73 535.72 A: um that they might fall behind and it's it's a real issue i know my sister's involved in education 

530.70 531.81 B: (( right uh-huh )) 

535.73 544.44 A: in the new york city school system and there she's been involved with a program she she um she and her husband actually sort of started a 

544.68 559.38 A: public private partnership in education um for an elementary school in in harlem and they were funded to the extent of being able to put a computer in each of their children's in um in each of their students' cla- um homes 

547.26 548.58 B: oh okay 

550.52 551.43 B: mhm 

558.91 560.13 B: oh okay 

559.63 571.93 A: and and then provide training for the parents too on how to how best to use it in the home and and it's really been remarkable um what it's done for that stu- that little student body they were very fortunate too 

562.54 563.62 B: right 

567.88 568.57 B: yeah 

570.49 583.97 B: oh yeah i guess so that sounds real interesting that i look and look i'm always looking for something new and different to do that sounds like something i might try to get involved in some kind of program i'm sure they have something like that here in georgia 

583.90 587.91 B: um something similar but that sounds like a real good program 

587.52 592.91 A: well you could go into the classroom and be an aide maybe or what were you thinking 

589.87 590.90 B: mhm 

592.78 599.95 B: well i was thinking maybe something like an after school program where ah because my my granddaughter's at the age 

596.91 598.12 A: right
