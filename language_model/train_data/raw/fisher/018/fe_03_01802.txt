1.35 3.19 B: hi i'm shera 

2.74 11.03 A: hi i'm patty [laughter] hi there [laughter] so um the topic is computers in education 

4.86 6.20 B: hi [laughter] 

10.83 12.09 B: (( yes )) 

11.48 12.72 A: um 

12.73 23.75 A: i guess i think um they're very important um since that's pretty much the way of the world these days um yeah i have a little boy who's 

23.86 29.68 A: three and he's already pretty good at at handling the mouse [laughter] so um 

27.67 28.64 B: wow 

29.87 31.26 A: what do you think 

31.21 39.58 B: um i think that they can be very useful and and they're a really good tool um to learn how to use in terms of being able to access information 

39.49 40.32 A: right 

39.68 47.20 B: and um determine like which information is like useful and what is you know just junk that's out there 

45.53 46.61 A: right 

46.84 48.05 A: (( right mhm )) 

47.43 59.68 B: and um and in terms of communicating people from different parts of the world who have different backgrounds that's an incredibly useful thing in education to um be in touch with people who are from different places in terms of geography and in terms of 

59.61 62.55 B: class and race and all those things 

62.24 63.44 A: i agree 

63.68 72.95 A: that's where i used to go to a book [laughter] an encyclopedia and look things up it's right on the internet i mean you can look up anything you need um 

72.13 74.59 B: and everything gets updated so quickly 

74.14 76.50 A: yes yes that's true 

76.63 89.63 A: yep um i have a stepdaughter who actually was here and she had to plan a trip over in europe and she was telling us exactly how many miles and it just varies like you said it's a useful tool 

90.12 91.12 B: yeah 

90.57 95.55 A: like i don't know where she would of got the information you know she would of had to go to the library 

95.59 99.43 A: to get all that [laughter] and maps and you know 

97.02 97.92 B: right 

99.62 112.17 A: whereas it was right there you type in your destination and um where you want to go how you want to get there and up it pops she had the mileage how much the air fare would be everything was right there 

112.94 113.83 A: (( yep )) 

112.98 114.26 B: it's incredible 

113.96 118.69 A: yep it sure is [laughter] i wish it did it would of been more popular when i was younger 

118.97 119.88 B: [laughter] 

119.37 121.04 A: [laughter] 

120.58 129.21 B: but then there's also um the aspect of it that's um that i think is pretty useful to spend a lot of time 

129.28 136.96 B: um talking to other people like face to face and interacting with people and not machines so like finding the balance between 

134.12 135.03 A: mm 

136.74 141.78 A: that's a good point that's a real good point is people maybe are going to 

137.78 138.92 B: yeah 

141.81 146.22 A: [laughter] forget how to communicate you know as in person 

146.37 147.27 B: right 

146.41 151.34 A: i mean if they're doing everything over the internet and over the computer 

151.62 154.38 A: that that's a good point too i never thought of that 

155.72 156.56 A: hm 

156.77 157.99 A: and also 

158.29 161.50 A: something that might worry me also is maybe that 

161.66 162.78 A: maybe 

162.94 167.69 A: it's almost too easy you know you can look at that aspect too 

168.45 169.92 A: i don't know [laughter] 

169.08 180.78 B: yeah well then um i mean i i went to school pretty recently and i don't know very much about the way that like the library system works how to like look up different books on different topics 

177.93 178.82 A: that's 

180.17 184.67 A: see that that's what i was talking about is you probably never even learned it did you 

181.12 182.20 B: yeah 

183.85 186.22 B: no we didn't learn it 

184.56 185.56 A: because 

185.45 192.01 A: yeah it it's not necessary it's pretty much outdated but then again a person should know you know 

189.10 189.93 B: right 

191.91 203.62 A: yeah i learned something called the dewey decimal system and how how they're [laughter] the numbering and all that and that was years ago and yeah they probably don't even teach that anymore 

194.61 195.88 B: yeah 

203.34 206.00 B: no they don't i just heard of it 'cause my mom 

205.96 207.00 A: [laughter] 

207.93 218.65 B: um yeah i have a friend who's a librarian and um she talks a lot about how um people don't use like libraries nearly as much as they used to because 

210.99 212.27 A: oh 

218.01 219.29 A: [laughter] 

218.75 224.82 B: everything is right in the computer you don't have to interact with people you don't have to leave your house if you have it the internet in your house 

224.18 225.64 A: right 

224.96 230.32 B: and and you can just get away with being so lazy and not ever talking to people 

229.96 231.07 A: yep 

230.48 235.10 B: and not having to like really use any skills just like you know bringing up a search engine 

234.74 237.90 A: yep that that's true that's very true 

238.42 246.48 A: hm it's interesting to think about and and if if we're using it so much now what's it gonna be like you know i always think twenty years 

246.11 247.34 B: yeah 

246.67 250.12 A: you know how advanced i mean gosh everything will be 

250.41 262.52 A: automated and you know you'll be able to i mean you already can pay your bills on line and you know banking you can do your banking [laughter] you're never going to have to go to any of these institutions anymore 

255.46 256.66 B: yeah 

263.10 264.03 B: right 

263.79 265.80 A: (( you know that that's true )) 

267.69 270.75 A: um even even music um 

270.93 281.81 A: you can listen to songs you can listen before you buy a c._d. you can go to the web site or the the c._d. and listen to it you know you can get a sample right over the internet 

281.71 283.44 B: yeah 

282.54 290.50 A: so yeah it allows allows consumers to listen and make decisions before they even buy anything 

290.95 292.26 B: yeah it's 

292.50 294.28 B: yeah 

293.68 294.55 A: (( [laughter] so )) 

297.41 299.56 A: beneficial and yet you know 

299.60 302.59 A: there's probably drawbacks too [laughter] 

301.92 302.87 B: yeah 

305.65 307.76 A: so um i'm trying to think of something else 

307.49 309.01 B: [laughter] 

308.00 309.26 A: [laughter] 

310.31 315.29 A: um well i know that children are learning about computers earlier and earlier i mean i think they have them 

315.58 317.59 A: in their kindergarten classes 

318.19 320.22 A: now i'm not sure but 

318.21 319.63 B: yeah wow 

320.38 322.68 A: i know there it's when i 

321.75 324.87 B: i have i have a memory of third grade 

324.33 325.58 A: really 

325.32 327.57 B: we had a computer class and 

327.54 340.05 B: i remember my teacher was mrs allen and um and we had to make the a turtle go around it was called logo where we had to make a turtle go around the screen and make a box 

339.44 341.32 A: oh funny 

340.03 343.82 B: and then we had to fill it in and so we had to learn the commands for that 

343.18 345.88 A: oh my gosh [laughter] 

344.98 350.69 B: and you know we learned how to touch type but and and that's really useful to me to know how to do that 

350.30 351.46 A: (( yeah )) 

350.87 356.85 B: but um i've never used logo i guess they didn't know that everything was gonna like 

357.39 365.66 B: um that like it wouldn't be useful to teach people computer programming that way because um everything gets like changed and updated all the time 

361.89 362.92 A: right 

365.32 366.38 A: right 

365.83 367.04 B: but um 

367.31 371.20 B: you know like i've never needed to make a turtle go around anything 

370.39 380.50 A: [laughter] you've never used that since huh well can i ask you did you ever take a typing class or key- would they have called it keyboarding you know did you learn to type 

373.02 373.95 B: right 

380.07 387.92 B: we we learned to type in like in third grade and then my mom got a um program to teach me and my sister how to type at home 

383.92 385.05 A: (( oh my gosh )) 

386.44 387.48 A: oh 

387.57 401.59 A: okay so you were learning that early i mean that's early to me 'cause i didn't learn that 'til high school and i learned on a typewriter so that's how things have changed i mean um we had these electric typewriters that were really heavy and clunky and 

391.03 393.01 B: yeah that's very early [laughter] 

395.86 397.05 B: oh wow 

401.50 416.20 A: so [laughter] i don't think anybody even uses those anymore i know that now it's keyboarding and it's computer classes and gosh third grade so you're probably really good at [laughter] typing by the time you were in sixth grade or something you know 

415.25 416.53 B: yeah [laughter] 

416.84 419.19 A: yeah that that's changed 

418.92 429.20 B: i remember um in starting in high school um all of the papers that we were submitting for any class they all had to be computer ty- like computer printed 

428.81 430.07 A: really 

429.32 434.75 B: which was really like problematic 'cause a few kids didn't have computers 'cause their families didn't have money 

434.45 435.91 A: right so what 

435.05 439.39 B: they had to like spend all of their afternoons at school working on the papers 

438.03 441.37 A: ah see that's yeah 

439.48 440.53 B: and um 

440.69 449.90 B: it was really it was really problematic that's another problem is that um it's really good when there's like these tools that people can use and they can't afford to have them in their own homes 

449.46 450.45 A: right 

449.83 456.10 B: but it's a problem when they aren't like publicly available but they're required for students because then 

455.84 457.02 A: right 

456.15 463.46 B: like people are in the situation where they're like they have no choice but to like to have more money than they have and they just don't 

458.44 459.47 A: they're in 

461.89 470.71 A: right that that's true and and that's true not everybody is so lucky to be have one at home and you know 

471.24 479.74 A: right if they're going to a library or something or school of course they only have certain hours where they can [laughter] use it you know 

478.81 479.64 B: yeah 

479.76 482.54 A: um yeah that's true too 

485.54 499.63 A: um i i wonder too i don't know what the ratio would be of children who have their own computers in their rooms or how you know that could cause a problem too as far as not not the education part but games and that kind of thing [laughter] 

491.34 492.58 B: oh my goodness 

498.77 502.35 B: yeah i mean when you're when you're working on a typewriter 

502.21 510.09 B: you're either like typing or you're not typing but on a computer you can be typing and like my mother she was in rabbinical school 

505.16 506.16 A: [laughter] 

509.90 522.08 B: and she was studying to be a rabbi and she would you know be studying for her tests and writing papers and she spent all of her evenings playing computer games because she like you know like it's so easy to procrastinate 

521.51 523.46 A: yes that's true 

522.20 524.80 B: and so easy to distract yourself 

524.35 526.26 A: 'cause it's right at your fingertips 

525.71 528.16 B: yeah it's just like this fun toy 

527.75 529.29 A: (( right )) 

528.36 531.36 B: that's also like homework or whatever it is 

530.09 533.66 A: right right that that's a good point too 

533.76 539.53 A: um you know how many games of solitaire do you get with your programming you know a lot [laughter] 

538.71 539.73 B: yeah 

539.55 542.76 A: yeah yeah that's a good point 

542.57 546.85 B: and the internet is like such a distraction for me 

546.29 549.85 A: [laughter] i've found out the ebay 

550.12 551.33 B: oh 

550.22 556.37 A: kind of a distraction you can buy anything you want you know you can it is amazing 

557.01 561.26 A: you can just spend hours and hours on end [laughter] 

561.59 562.65 B: yeah 

562.55 563.68 A: for sure 

564.65 568.85 B: and again you can spend hours and hours on end and never see a person 

568.34 574.03 A: yeah [laughter] yeah that that's true isolate you a little bit and wow 

575.37 576.51 B: yeah 

575.92 585.55 A: i know when we first got a computer my well then boyfriend he spent hours and hours and and yet he taught himself how to use the computer 

585.60 599.89 A: so you know he never took a computer class or anything as far as education and he knows way more than i do i mean i've taken classes and but he knows as far as you know how to load this or do that or you know 

589.22 590.33 B: oh wow
