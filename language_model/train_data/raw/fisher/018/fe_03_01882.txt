108.77 112.76 B: so any idea exactly what we are supposed to talk about just family huh 

112.26 121.72 A: are supposed to talk about family i believe the study is just doing linguistics which is our vocal tones the words we choose how we enunciate and articulate 

122.26 126.57 A: um that's my understanding of what linguistics is anyway so 

127.08 133.57 A: i'm not sure exactly what they're looking for but they're trying to make the topic something general that everybody can talk about [laughter] 

133.05 138.21 B: right right so you have little ones what did you say four and six four 

137.30 141.40 A: four and five yes they are little they are fifteen months apart

162.60 164.92 B: um are they boys girls or what 

164.76 168.23 A: it's ah my younger one is a boy and my older one is a girl 

168.32 171.72 B: how has he adapted to his sister being in school 

171.70 175.79 A: well they um he is also in school so it's not been a huge 

175.57 176.36 B: (( ahah )) 

176.54 179.32 A: my daughter started preschool when she was three 

179.34 183.26 A: and at the time that was very hard for him 

183.48 186.54 A: when she started because he always wanted to go too 

186.58 187.84 B: right 

187.00 188.94 A: and he wasn't allowed to go 

189.85 196.81 A: and that was hard but now he also started school then when he turned three both of my children are in special education 

196.83 197.68 B: mhm 

197.08 200.14 A: um so they started younger and 

201.67 204.43 A: ah they are both speech language delayed 

205.90 206.77 A: so 

207.85 213.07 B: but now have you found that ah school has helped your daughter 

212.78 219.68 A: tremendously yes she is um she is still a little bit behind but she is not as far behind as she was 

219.56 220.64 B: great 

220.31 222.06 A: so it has very been very 

221.11 223.53 B: does she have a hearing problem as well 

223.28 228.56 A: no and that's what everybody says when they are speech language that hearing is the you know most common 

228.42 229.50 B: right 

229.18 234.03 A: sector and actually she did not even have an earache until she was four 

233.67 234.80 B: my goodness 

234.32 237.62 A: and my son has never had an ear infection yet 

237.03 238.66 B: oh that's wonderful 

238.72 242.13 A: so other things but not an ear infection 

241.50 246.18 B: i i wondered ah we have three boys and a girl the girl is the youngest and 

246.25 247.51 B: she had 

249.51 254.63 B: hearing problems she had ear infections from the time she was two weeks old 

253.98 255.37 A: did she get tubes 

255.10 261.74 B: ah she did get one tube and then when that tube came out it caused a hole in her eardrum 

261.53 262.81 A: oh no 

262.46 270.84 B: she's had four operations to close up that hole on her eardrum the last one i think she had when she was sixteen 

271.36 275.20 B: and that one held the longest probably 

275.24 281.72 B: mhm three or four years but the the membrane was so thin and now she does have another hole in her eardrum 

281.75 291.27 B: so she has a hearing loss but for for several years of course when she started school she had a problem with speaking she didn't have a problem 

291.86 296.81 B: as far as ah you know talking later learning to talk 

296.99 300.51 B: or talking later she had a problem with sounds 

300.97 301.82 A: yeah 

301.25 305.14 B: with words themselves understanding what the word was 

302.96 303.97 A: (( [cough] yeah )) 

305.39 310.60 B: or the concept of it and with spelling of course she had a big problem with that 

310.99 312.11 A: yeah 

311.94 313.66 B: but she has 

313.75 319.05 B: she did compensate quite well and she had speech therapy in school 

319.33 321.73 B: which helped her tremendously 

321.26 331.53 A: yeah it really does help i know with my children they both have expressive and receptive language delays and it has been a tremendous 

331.93 334.76 A: change since they started speech therapy 

334.41 335.48 B: great 

336.17 341.38 B: that's great ah is that something that's hereditary because both of your children have 

340.27 345.95 A: that's what they said yes they don't know they're they're not quite sure what you know causes it um 

346.38 351.42 A: they don't know for sure since there is no problem with the ears 

346.46 347.22 B: it 

352.09 358.40 A: why it even happens because that's always when your you know when your children are you want to know why [laughter] 

357.19 358.82 B: right of course [laughter] 

358.63 364.32 A: and they really can't say um and they say they may have some you know difficulty 

364.51 366.55 A: with learning um 

366.65 371.31 A: because they are behind with their expressive language and receptive language and they said that might you know 

371.52 377.90 A: pose difficulties and it has and you know my daughter is behind as far as general skills 

378.18 385.03 A: but not extremely far but she also has problems with the gross motor skills you know she is not as well balanced 

385.31 386.73 A: as other people 

387.55 391.92 A: her age but now my son has the same thing and he his balance is fine 

389.66 391.06 B: (( i see )) 

392.84 394.25 B: interesting isn't 

393.31 397.59 A: it's very strange 'cause they don't know exactly what causes it or 

398.21 400.40 A: you know why it happens 

400.66 402.65 A: it's a very strange thing 

400.75 401.58 B: it 

402.76 404.60 B: yes it is 

403.80 405.22 A: and we have been 

405.72 410.03 A: trying to you know adjust and figure out what ways that we can help them learn 

410.29 411.29 A: better 

412.41 415.66 A: so unfortunately they just don't quite know [laughter] 

416.64 419.75 A: they all try and help and you know they don't 

420.32 421.95 A: they don't have the answer 

421.80 422.95 B: right 

423.26 425.28 A: they don't have any answers 

423.40 424.92 B: right 

425.18 426.08 B: (( well )) 

426.67 429.79 B: so what kind of fun things do you and your family do 

431.41 436.09 A: well not much this week um my son has scarlet fever 

436.25 437.30 B: oh dear 

437.79 442.13 A: and so he is covered with a rash and he is still contagious 

442.60 449.02 A: but right now my my daughter is a daisy girl scout they start that in kindergarten 

448.44 450.72 B: oh neat i bet she's enjoying 

450.57 460.27 A: yeah two thousand i'm a i'm a co leader for that so that keeps me quite busy i volunteer in their schools it's very important to me 

453.12 454.01 B: that 

455.83 457.43 B: right 

461.07 467.94 A: to be able to do that and that's one of the reasons why i am home i am i currently stay home with my children 

467.64 471.27 B: that's one of the best jobs and the hardest jobs there is 

470.63 473.57 A: mhm and ah i love 

473.59 478.63 A: being able to do that i am a former teacher i used to teach high school english and speech and theatre 

479.73 482.35 B: well you are well suited for this study then 

482.34 489.82 A: yeah it was ah it was very important that you know i was able to stay home and and that's what we did and i've been home 

490.02 495.26 A: i had a very bad pregnancy with my daughter and i wound up leaving mid school year 

495.79 498.07 A: um on the advice of my doctor 

497.57 498.97 B: mhm 

498.16 500.00 A: with my daughter's pregnancy 

500.74 506.29 A: and ah i've been home ever since and trying to stay home [laughter] 

505.87 509.07 B: it it's great if you can i was a stay at home mom as well 

509.16 517.93 B: and my husband um is disabled he spent twenty years in the service and got out with a disability and then after that had several heart attacks so 

518.16 520.78 B: ah he had to go on permanent disability 

521.28 527.10 B: ah even well actually that was before we were married he was on permanent disability so he's always been home 

527.25 531.49 B: and i got to be a stay at home mom too 

531.55 541.62 B: and i was just talking with a friend of mine today that i went to lunch with and we were talking about television and i said one of probably one of the best things we ever did for our family was we took the t._v. out 

541.83 544.61 B: we had no television for about ten years 

544.75 556.13 B: while our kids were growing up and at first it was like a culture shock [laughter] ah but we learned to play games to read um 

548.63 550.47 A: yeah i can imagine 

556.33 562.28 B: make up games do charades little skits and plays go places together 

563.03 571.97 B: and as i look back on it i think it probably was one of the best things we ever did for our family for our kids was 

572.13 573.30 B: just to 

573.72 578.26 B: take it out because we really just sometimes weren't smart enough to turn it off 

578.59 579.97 B: disciplined enough 

580.00 581.12 B: so ah 

581.70 589.72 A: that's actually something that yeah it does t._v. is a big issue i know many of my children's friends have televisions in their bedrooms 

581.83 584.53 B: we just enjoyed our family 

589.92 591.15 B: right 

590.48 595.03 A: and i can't stand that [laughter] i can't stand it at all 

595.34 598.25 A: we have one t._v. in the house it's in our basement 

598.58 599.62 A: and it's not
