23.37 24.34 B: oh 

26.17 28.77 A: my family is pretty much my life [noise] 

28.29 29.23 B: (( ah )) 

29.95 32.73 B: well i have one son and i am 

33.44 40.56 B: a part time worker and mostly full time stay at home mom i work two and a half days a week 

37.85 38.68 A: (( ahah )) 

41.01 43.95 B: and my son is three and a half 

44.41 46.67 B: and ah i'm married 

47.31 49.63 B: and that's my little family 

48.94 50.16 A: [laughter] 

49.98 52.62 B: that and two neurotic animals 

52.02 58.74 A: oh yeah [laughter] we have two cats and a dog and i guess they would be part of our family 

53.10 54.15 B: yeah 

58.31 62.69 B: well sure sure they seem like family when they've been with you so long 

62.24 63.27 A: uh-huh 

63.41 66.38 B: and then of course we have got grannies and grandmas 

66.77 67.48 A: (( ahah )) 

67.09 68.93 B: and all of that so 

69.52 73.04 A: we we moved away from most of our um 

73.43 75.36 A: immediate family so 

74.69 75.65 B: really 

75.44 78.92 A: we kind of got a little bit of breathing room [laughter] 

78.31 80.26 B: was was it hard though too 

80.78 90.09 A: no we were ready it was time to go and it was a really small town so it was exciting to get to go see something new 

82.03 82.93 B: really 

86.17 86.94 B: (( mhm )) 

89.70 93.67 B: and i can't wait to get back to my small town [laughter] 

92.76 94.55 A: [laughter] 

93.79 95.17 B: isn't that funny 

94.74 96.04 A: yeah 

96.32 97.18 B: well 

96.93 99.66 A: so what does your son do while he is home with you 

99.84 105.36 B: he ah actually we do ah we are looking into home schooling 

105.09 106.25 A: really 

105.61 115.85 B: and so we do lots of activities together we work on our numbers and and ah he's very computer literate already which is scary 

115.45 116.24 A: (( yeah )) 

116.42 118.12 A: [laughter] 

117.24 125.54 B: but ah he's he's just a real sweet kid in fact it's odd that the topic should be family because we just found out he has a 

125.96 130.15 B: potentially life threatening condition we found out yesterday 

129.84 131.44 A: oh i'm sorry 

130.62 135.68 B: oh it's it's okay it's doubtful that it will ever threaten his life but ah 

135.83 139.70 B: he he might end up having to have a liver transplant 

139.54 140.84 A: (( oh my )) 

140.26 145.16 B: and so ah it does kind of make you think about family doesn't it 

144.44 145.59 A: mhm 

145.46 147.71 B: and how much yours means to you 

147.83 149.20 A: absolutely 

148.78 149.90 B: and ah 

150.40 155.65 B: it's funny how you you don't know what you are missing before you have 'em and when you do have 'em 

155.90 157.85 B: you just don't know what you'd do without 'em 

157.54 161.43 A: right it's hard to remember a time without kids 

160.81 164.55 B: yeah it is it is and that happens so quickly 

163.95 166.40 A: yeah [laughter] 

166.43 169.56 B: what do you do with your children do you home school or 

169.44 178.99 A: no i'm not brave enough or patient enough to do that [laughter] i enjoy my kids going to school [laughter] they ah 

176.01 177.07 B: (( [laughter] )) 

179.10 182.95 A: well my oldest one is seventeen so she'll be out shortly 

180.89 181.99 B: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

182.81 183.55 B: (( my )) 

183.03 187.64 A: and moving on to college so that will be quite an experience for us 

186.68 187.98 B: yeah 

187.82 191.15 A: and actually she's really not home a lot any more 

191.77 194.85 A: since she you know got her licence and 

194.23 195.55 B: oh yeah 

194.96 205.10 A: is a mom and is busy and my other ones are eight and ah i'm sorry we've just had a birthday nine and five so they fight a lot 

205.57 211.68 A: [laughter] mhm and ah i spend a lot of time refereeing and now we have started ah 

212.08 217.12 A: t. ball and softball and they'll do soccer and 

213.83 214.79 B: mhm 

217.09 220.29 B: we started t. ball we had our first practice tuesday 

220.81 222.41 A: yeah how did it go 

222.09 223.41 B: went great 

223.06 224.31 A: good 

223.60 226.10 B: my little fellow just loved it 

226.49 230.94 B: so because even though he's sick he doesn't feel or act sick 

231.13 234.46 B: and so that's good he he enjoys things 

234.72 236.73 B: and just has a good time 

235.19 235.79 A: (( [laughter] )) 

236.70 239.19 A: how did you um finally 

239.76 243.08 A: come to find out he was sick if he doesn't act like it 

242.46 247.18 B: he kept having elevated liver functions on his blood tests 

247.44 257.37 B: and um the doctor kind of blew me off and i pressed and pressed and pressed un- until finally we found a doctor that said yeah we need to find out what's going on 

257.40 258.67 A: good 

258.00 262.43 B: and ah we took him to vanderbilt in nashville tennessee 

261.88 262.73 A: uh-huh 

262.80 268.34 B: and they finally found it after thirty one hundred dollars worth of tests 

267.90 269.13 A: oh my 

268.86 273.88 B: they finally found it so now we know what we're up against so that's good 

273.28 275.72 A: and is there medication available 

275.15 276.81 B: no there's no treatment 

276.25 277.20 A: no 

276.88 279.16 B: no it's it's just hereditary 

279.06 280.06 A: mhm 

279.73 285.16 B: but but we're okay we're okay and i found that the more 

285.55 296.20 B: um i don't know how you feel about it but the more problems that come into my family the more i turn to god and and that's also a very vital part of our family 

292.14 293.50 A: absolutely 

295.70 296.83 A: mhm 

296.25 297.77 B: the good lord 

297.17 299.34 A: we have a wonderful church family 

299.04 299.91 B: (( ahah )) 

299.87 300.73 A: (( and )) 

300.86 302.41 A: we were just amazed 

302.69 306.87 A: i told you we had moved away from our family and they really 

307.01 314.02 A: probably support us more than our biological family just because a lot of them aren't christians 

313.38 315.92 B: isn't that funny how that begins to happen 

314.22 315.42 A: mhm 

315.61 317.02 A: yeah 

316.71 320.85 B: so the family is in danger these days so i think 

320.42 321.20 A: yes 

321.37 325.31 B: you know there's so many things that kids are having to deal with 

325.13 326.17 A: mhm 

325.80 329.84 B: with regard to families you know all these new and 

330.08 331.50 B: and 

331.90 334.15 B: unusual ideas 

333.81 335.65 A: mhm yeah 

334.67 338.66 B: and ideas that don't go along with with the way i was raised 

338.52 339.45 A: right 

339.69 344.36 B: i i don't know it's scary you wonder if someone's gonna make it 

341.86 343.33 A: and it seems like 

343.75 353.02 A: yeah it seems like if you speak out against it ah like maybe your opinion and my opinion aren't valid but theirs is you know what i'm saying 

351.25 352.22 B: right 

352.45 354.41 B: right oh i understand 

354.76 355.42 A: (( it's )) 

355.95 359.05 A: kind of weird we didn't have to deal with that when we were younger mhm mhm 

358.45 360.58 B: yeah it was nice you know 

360.59 362.49 B: and family was 

362.99 365.61 B: a very well defined role 

365.85 367.59 B: when we were kids 

367.98 369.93 B: and that was good 

369.96 373.31 B: i think those definitions and those boundaries are good 

373.44 374.40 A: yeah 

373.75 374.93 B: but 

375.11 384.75 B: but we also you know we have people at church and we consider them family and and friends that have known us forever and know all the dirty secrets and 

384.07 386.13 A: [laughter] 

385.48 388.83 B: and where all the skeletons are hidden in all their family too 

388.70 392.34 A: and they love us anyway [laughter] 

390.04 391.42 B: isn't that the truth 

392.09 393.53 B: (( isn't that the truth )) 

393.85 395.15 B: i think i think 

395.34 402.46 B: that's the most important thing that you can teach your children as far as a family goes is that a family loves each other no matter what 

401.86 403.04 A: mhm 

402.97 403.94 B: you know 

403.75 404.48 A: (( yes )) 

404.39 406.78 B: that's what i'm trying to teach my munchkin 

406.42 407.69 A: [laughter] 

408.01 415.92 B: i hear yours [laughter] mine is actually headed to granny's because i have the the beginnings of a migraine 

410.02 411.17 A: yeah 

415.55 418.26 A: oh i'm sorry i get those too 

417.56 419.40 B: ah yeah i i 

418.67 421.79 A: it's really hard to deal with when your kids are needing attention 

421.12 425.39 B: yeah luckily granny is is almost always available 

425.48 429.01 B: and ah especially when i'm sick or not feeling well 

428.19 429.80 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

429.40 435.53 B: and i see you know when you get on the phone there's this hormone in kid's bodies 

435.76 438.53 B: that says you've got to get momma off the phone 

437.39 441.55 A: [laughter] you're right [laughter] 

440.30 443.87 B: or you have to make as much noise as humanly possible 

443.14 447.01 A: yep i think husbands have that too [laughter] 

445.90 447.65 B: you know i think so 

447.98 450.31 B: it's it's a genetic thing too 

449.38 451.38 A: [laughter] 

452.06 455.25 A: my husband is gone a lot he works on the railroad and 

454.61 455.67 B: (( mhm )) 

455.92 456.71 A: i 

457.13 464.82 A: we go round and round because he's gone so much and then the kids will start acting really bad after he's gone for several days 

464.05 466.96 B: mhm that's that's bound to be hard 

465.05 465.91 A: so 

466.38 478.73 A: yeah it's like there's a kind of a power struggle every time he comes home because you know i have to handle everything while he's gone and and when he walks in he thinks it ought to be the way he wants it [laughter] 

474.19 475.27 B: (( exactly )) 

477.61 479.43 B: right right 

479.02 483.28 A: but we're we're learning to live with it and he likes his job so 

482.97 483.94 B: yeah 

483.74 485.79 A: that counts for a lot 

484.23 487.69 B: my husband is kind of the same way he's second shift 

487.14 488.43 A: oh 

487.95 490.57 B: and so i'm here the majority 

490.21 491.16 A: (( ahah )) 

490.66 493.69 B: and you know he's on fourteen off three 

494.17 502.31 B: and so we have the exact same problem when daddy's home you know i try to defer to him because it's the thing to do but 

501.57 502.49 A: yeah 

502.62 504.38 B: but it's and it's 

504.86 510.54 B: it it's really odd this is the subject because it is all about redefining family 

509.96 510.97 A: mhm 

510.97 516.86 B: you know and i'm not sure i like it i don't like the new definitions i like the old ones 

515.48 516.40 A: no 

517.77 524.40 A: yeah like the june and ward clever [laughter] not very realistic but you know 

521.82 522.65 B: (( ah )) 

523.52 524.42 B: not 

525.01 528.14 B: very realistic but definitely good 

527.57 528.61 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

528.85 531.17 B: you know something to shoot for anyway 

530.77 541.65 A: yeah that's all i've ever asked my husband for is a normal life [laughter] so the railroad's not kind of fitting into my scheme of things but that's okay 

534.46 535.46 B: uh-huh 

535.77 536.69 B: yeah 

541.94 545.11 B: it's a good living at least so i guess 

543.89 545.38 A: yeah it's not bad mhm 

546.22 548.22 B: we should be glad for that 

548.38 551.87 B: you do you have your family is all very far from you 

550.63 553.31 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

553.77 555.47 A: yeah 

554.96 556.07 B: that that 

556.63 562.70 B: while it may be good it it can also be bad you can't just ship 'em off to granny's when you are having a migraine 

562.29 564.33 A: right it's hard to get a break 

563.96 565.75 B: yeah yeah 

565.45 566.86 A: and the kids don't 

566.98 574.16 A: know grandparents like i did and [noise] grandparents can teach a kid so much 

569.89 571.00 B: right 

574.35 578.26 A: that you know maybe mum isn't patient enough or even have the time 

578.73 579.34 A: (( to )) 

579.92 581.77 B: and it's it's a 

582.23 585.74 B: it's really important to know where you came from too i think 

585.17 586.52 A: (( do it )) 

586.51 589.85 B: but my mom lives a couple of hours away [noise] so 

589.09 591.05 A: [noise] 

589.91 591.81 B: jacob doesn't see her very much 

591.98 592.93 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

592.22 597.16 B: but ah we're lucky to have granny here and granddaddy and they live on a farm 

597.12 599.05 A: oh that's nice i 

598.13 599.11 B: (( yeah yeah ))
