32.93 34.20 B: yeah 

33.68 36.88 A: um especially with everything that's going on in the world 

37.03 49.75 A: it makes me a lot closer with her you know i mean especially kidnappings and this and that you know you gotta keep your eye on you know your child and you know and with the war going on it makes you want to be closer 

49.92 55.79 A: makes me want to be closer with my family because you never know september eleventh people 

52.35 53.33 B: right 

54.90 58.81 B: you kind of value your family more mhm yeah 

55.82 57.67 A: yeah just go to work

63.09 71.96 A: so i mean they have accidents shootings you go to french quarter you know you your mother might go to the french quarter to go you know have something to eat or something and come out and get shot 

71.48 72.73 B: yeah 

72.23 77.72 A: so you have to treasure what you have because you know it might not be there tomorrow 

77.38 78.42 B: right 

77.95 79.14 A: (( and mhm )) 

78.50 83.68 B: well i'm twenty two years old i actually live with my boyfriend adrian 

83.71 95.71 B: and i it's sort of a chosen family more than my biological family i've just graduated from college so i've sort of been able to make my own decisions about my family for the first time 

95.75 98.23 B: and to me um 

98.17 103.97 B: i guess like you were saying about the war it does make me kind of value people that are in my life more 

103.89 111.33 B: some of my friends are actually serving right now so it kind of it does make me think about the safety of my family and where they are 

111.20 121.67 B: and stuff like september eleventh did make me think you know where is my family at the time actually on september eleventh my dad was flying in a plane my biological father um 

122.50 137.22 B: and you know i was really worried about him it made me realise that really our time here is limited our time with our families is limited and it also started me thinking about eventually my parents are going to die both my mom and dad are alive right now 

137.58 146.97 B: um so it made me just kind of reconsider my family you know and what they mean to me and what it would be like to have them not here anymore 

147.15 149.86 A: right that's the unexpected tragedy 

149.44 153.24 B: yeah especially something that huge i just 

153.33 163.59 B: i don't know how i i would deal with something like that you know and it's not just in an attack against your family but almost like an attack against everything we stand for is really what it was 

162.25 163.22 A: (( right exactly )) 

163.58 175.79 A: and all the people that are sitting there protesting when there's people out there and that's their families out there and they see that on television and they're like why is somebody objecting against my child and my family and their beliefs 

175.49 177.11 B: yeah i actually 

175.91 178.41 A: 'cause everybody that's there wants to be 

178.22 184.77 B: yeah well i have um one of my ex-boyfriends actually is serving in iraq right now 

184.83 185.85 A: (( oh wow )) 

184.94 197.18 B: and it kind of we were engaged for a while and we broke up um he married someone else but while he he actually just a couple of days ago sent me a letter 

197.27 206.03 B: saying you know that one time we were engaged we were really close and i want you to know that whatever happens to me you're still important to me and i hope that 

206.13 210.85 B: you know nothing i did during the course of our relationship hurt you in any way 

210.90 215.42 B: and that really well it was really touching but it also kind of made me think 

215.47 223.26 B: you know it's really a dangerous situation and a couple of my friends are married and one of my best friends her husband is over there 

223.67 224.93 A: oh wow 

223.70 226.82 B: and yeah to her it's kind of 

227.03 232.64 B: but it's this brand new family they actually got married about a week before he was shipped out 

232.50 233.84 A: oh wow 

233.05 235.66 B: yeah um and to her 

234.80 236.10 A: where are you from 

235.91 240.19 B: i'm from ah charleston south carolina but i live in ashville north carolina 

238.08 239.04 A: oh okay 

239.91 241.12 A: oh okay 

240.62 241.74 B: yeah 

241.15 243.36 A: so you're over there you're far from me [laughter] 

242.71 245.04 B: yeah quite a bit actually 

243.46 256.26 A: yeah you know more i don't know if i know anybody 'cause like i went to college and a lot of the boys did go you know they were in the army and they do their little month thing and i don't know if any of them are out there 

253.15 254.28 B: mhm 

255.63 256.99 B: yeah 

256.43 262.73 A: and um i need to find out if anybody's out there 'cause then it makes you start thinking hey i knew this person and 

262.51 272.07 A: whether or not they're not family with the word family what does that mean you know like my best friend i love my best friend with all my heart i consider her my family right 

262.53 264.05 B: i wonder if they're 

264.11 265.53 B: yeah 

271.44 283.62 B: right that's how i feel i think you choose your family i don't think like i don't think just your biological family is your family um i think that your friends are like a family you create 

277.17 278.51 A: blood right 

283.31 284.35 A: (( correct )) 

283.74 292.68 B: and to me since um i've been living on my own since i was about fifteen i moved out um so i've sort of been choosing my family since then 

292.92 293.73 A: right 

293.26 304.53 B: um and at school i know definitely my roommates became like sisters to me and i've been out of school now almost a year and i still keep in really good touch with them 

304.45 309.23 B: i talk to them probably more than i do my my blood family 

308.77 309.77 A: right 

309.52 310.38 B: um 

310.65 315.16 A: but i mean it's very hard 'cause you you start thinking about people that 

315.22 321.49 A: were your family maybe years ago that are out there and if something happened to them then you're like oh my god 

318.53 319.88 B: yeah 

321.78 324.12 A: that was part of me 

324.37 325.58 B: yeah 

324.39 331.07 A: you know especially when i was in college and partying you know that was my family back then you know now i've settled down a little bit you know and 

328.44 329.51 B: yeah 

330.24 332.71 B: have kind of a different life yeah 

331.66 336.92 A: right but i mean still that is that would affect me if something happened to them and 

334.56 335.61 B: yeah 

337.11 343.48 A: i just think family's important blood distance or just friends 

341.18 342.11 B: yeah 

343.25 344.43 B: yeah 

343.86 351.29 A: and you have to treasure them 'cause you never know what's gonna happen to them you know i mean i lost i lost somebody that was part of my life 

347.44 348.62 B: right 

351.52 362.21 A: way back when i was in my college years and i find out that she's gone and i mean i don't even know her anymore you know and it was like a big shock well i mean you know it wasn't a shock i mean [mn] 

352.44 353.52 B: mhm 

357.67 358.90 B: right 

362.39 367.39 A: but she it was just like i wished that i could a been there and maybe helped her 

367.29 368.48 B: yeah 

367.82 370.03 A: you know and 

369.59 375.54 B: i know exactly how you feel actually a friend of mine committed suicide um a few years ago 

373.37 374.56 A: wow 

375.34 388.25 A: yeah see they don't know if she committed it was a drug overdose like we don't know if she committed suicide or if it how it was you know and i've had a couple you know living in new orleans it's not that common to have drug overdoses and there's been a couple in my life 

380.13 381.39 B: right 

385.92 387.19 B: right 

387.95 389.02 B: right 

388.50 392.91 A: you know and i'm fortunate enough to not have to draw myself out of that 

393.25 397.40 A: when it got that bad when things started getting bad that i walked 

394.71 395.96 B: yeah 

397.59 398.53 B: mhm 

397.79 402.15 A: because i didn't want to be a part of that lifestyle and luckily for me 

400.14 409.88 B: right i think that's really good yeah my friend that um that died actually she this is a really strange coincidence but she was living in new orleans at the time 

409.92 412.27 B: and she was going to school um 

412.73 418.57 B: and and she was one of the people she was one of my best friends and we were really close 

418.47 427.49 B: but she had sort of started down a path in her life that included a lot of drugs a lot of bad decisions and even though she was still 

427.36 433.67 B: i would still consider her a part of my life part of my family one of my best friends but i was sort of having to 

433.72 436.94 B: separate myself from her in a lot of ways because of that 

434.95 448.50 A: right yeah you have to distance yourself when they make bad choices and you can't tell somebody what to do you know we're older we're not little kids anymore when we tell somebody you know don't do it and they're going to listen to you you know you have to try to 

438.42 439.62 B: yeah 

446.24 447.64 B: right 

448.77 462.67 A: take their mind off you know go to different places that don't have that type of things and that's what i would do but i mean i just distanced myself because it started getting too bad and that was part of i guess my family back then but 

452.51 453.88 B: mhm 

457.56 458.85 B: yeah 

462.27 463.56 B: yeah 

462.89 465.34 A: you know and you still you have feelings 

464.89 466.92 B: do you have any brothers and sisters 

466.34 467.60 A: no i don't oh okay 

467.14 477.43 B: i have um i have an older sister who is two years older than me and i have two younger brothers and one of my brothers actually is kind of what you were talking about 

477.52 490.83 B: you sort of have to i had to separate myself from him he has a lot of drug problems he has discipline problems he's been in and out of juvenile hall and jail and it's really kind of it's funny because both of my parents are 

486.29 487.33 A: oh 

490.75 495.16 B: really well educated and you know sort of my mom's a teacher 

492.33 493.72 A: right mine too 

494.84 497.82 A: oh mine is too what a coincidence [laughter] 

495.89 501.65 B: oh wow she actually has just stopped teaching high school very recently 

500.13 502.97 A: oh okay mine's middle school so 

502.09 503.74 B: yeah wow 

503.80 504.94 B: that's a job that 

504.03 513.53 A: and i went into that but i just i'm in paralegal now i i distanced myself from [laughter] teaching all together that's not a choice that i wanted to make you know 

507.18 508.24 B: yeah 

512.53 516.34 B: yeah there's teaching tends to run in families i've noticed 

515.67 530.16 A: right yeah my best friend her her mother's a teacher and she's a teacher they teach at the same school so it's like a little family there you know it's my best friend my mom knows her you know and you know my mom helped her get the job her mom and it's like we went to that school also 

520.46 522.37 B: (( wow that's kinda cool )) 

524.36 525.51 B: yeah 

529.75 530.94 B: yeah 

530.33 536.64 A: so she you know most of the teachers they have retired or or passed you know since then 'cause i mean it's been a while 

534.79 535.95 B: right 

536.25 537.27 B: right 

536.63 551.48 A: but um she does know a lot of the teachers and even and you know and that's that's like a family there because when i go up in there even the teachers that i didn't have i know them all from my mother and that's her little family like my mom calls her students she calls them her kids 

546.17 547.30 B: right 

550.80 558.36 B: yeah actually so did my mom um i don't know if i would actually want to work with my real family [laughter] or not though 

557.39 558.10 A: (( [laughter] )) 

558.34 560.28 A: (( right it is something )) 

558.39 562.64 B: um i love them but i think we'd drive each other crazy 

562.05 563.89 A: right right 

563.23 578.22 B: um but luckily you know it's kind of funny that i think in the past hundred years american business has totally changed it used to be all family businesses and now in most businesses you couldn't work with your family even if you wanted to 

573.61 574.44 A: right 

577.92 579.06 A: right 

578.41 586.49 B: and actually we were talking about that um my boyfriend works with his mom they work in the same company but in a different department 

583.13 584.11 A: oh 

586.08 587.30 A: oh okay 

586.79 598.29 B: which is for them it means they spend more time together they wouldn't otherwise spend together they ride to work together i think it does make them closer and they get along really well so i think it's okay for them but 

591.33 592.12 A: right 

598.18 599.95 A: right we're planning a wedding over 

598.64 599.50 B: [laughter]
