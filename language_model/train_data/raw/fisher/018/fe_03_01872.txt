180.12 187.40 A: you know it's like w- we don't you don't get to chose your family um but your choice is like how to how to 

188.44 199.42 A: you know a lot of the time i think the challenge is like how to be yourself the same time as like respect your family and figure out how to work out um any sort of differences you might have or 

200.14 206.49 A: um that sort of thing and you know 'cause it's like we all go through different stages of life and we all have different 

206.80 214.13 A: points when family family like as part- you know takes care of of different different needs you know

246.99 259.54 A: good five and a half hours from worcester but it's certainly you know i'm not in france or hong kong or or the west coast you know and i think that's definitely a part of it for sure 

259.61 265.53 B: yeah and i see i hav- also have a dif- different definition of family that i 

260.20 260.93 A: but

273.94 274.86 A: (( mm )) 

280.60 281.66 A: mhm 

283.86 290.64 B: they might as well have just been my family [laughter] because i would not have been able to do it without them 

286.29 288.08 A: mhm yeah 

290.32 291.58 A: mhm 

290.93 293.10 B: and my my

302.08 303.14 A: mhm 

303.43 304.53 A: yeah 

304.89 306.22 B: yeah so 

306.09 310.05 A: yeah yeah it's it's so true that like you know your family like 

310.48 316.53 A: can go beyond your biological family you know and be like your community in lots of ways 

313.42 314.60 B: (( [noise] )) 

315.92 316.63 B: [noise] 

316.66 319.37 A: um how did you lose your your father

325.25 326.35 A: mhm 

326.07 327.99 B: bad bad um 

328.64 330.93 B: bad situation but 

331.18 332.36 B: um 

331.21 332.31 A: mhm 

332.46 339.66 B: as far as we were we were a very close family um a lot of families aren't close 

336.70 337.69 A: mhm 

339.22 340.46 A: mhm 

339.73 345.61 B: so i went to take care of my brother in texas while my mother took care of my father 

345.52 346.57 A: wow 

346.81 347.73 B: (( so )) 

346.91 348.23 A: in chicago 

348.30 354.17 B: yeah my dad was in chicago and my brother was in texas my brother had a three year old at the time 

353.86 354.84 A: mhm 

354.22 361.81 B: he was young he was thirty eight he had head and neck cancer which is a a terrible cancer so um 

356.03 357.08 A: wow 

360.66 361.77 A: wow 

362.11 365.04 B: so we were close before but um 

365.67 377.83 B: it made us even closer because as adults you tend to you know go your own ways you have your own thoughts on things and and when you don't see each other all the time um 

376.90 377.94 A: mhm 

378.05 381.14 B: i found out a lot of things about my brother that i didn't know

381.51 382.58 A: like what 

381.66 382.63 B: um 

383.66 386.39 B: um like what 

387.64 388.84 B: um 

389.22 390.19 B: [mn] 

391.08 394.65 B: let's see how do i how do i word it um 

395.38 396.45 B: he 

396.80 407.62 B: he was always really rough and tumble and and um very aggressive and yet i saw this really really sweet side of him i had not seen before 

400.64 401.73 A: mhm 

407.24 408.73 A: mm mhm 

408.00 416.70 B: so um and i got to spend more time with him before he died than i probably did the last ten years because i lived in l._a. before i moved to atlanta 

413.33 414.40 A: wow 

416.38 417.52 A: mhm 

417.24 419.67 B: so and i had my kids too 

418.66 419.69 A: mhm 

419.91 428.65 B: and i think my kids have a different opinion of family than i do because i grew up with all my relatives everywhere we had italian gatherings every 

422.66 423.63 A: mhm 

426.02 427.00 A: mhm 

428.95 438.39 B: single holiday every other sunday and my kids don't have any immediate i i take it back i have an aunt who just moved here 

437.98 438.93 A: mhm 

438.62 448.29 B: but [noise] she works full time yeah it's not the same as growing up with i mean i had twenty cousins and my kids don't even know who they are [noise] se they live all over 

439.41 441.43 A: it's not the same yeah 

445.91 446.99 A: wow 

447.78 448.95 A: mhm 

448.96 450.29 B: so um 

450.34 458.20 B: i had some of my cousins come for thanksgiving this year this past year and my kids are like who are they you know my kids are 

456.24 457.35 A: wow 

458.87 463.79 B: eleven and fourteen and yet they are just meeting them for the first time so it's kind of interesting 

460.25 461.17 A: mhm 

462.08 463.10 A: wow 

463.69 468.23 A: mhm does that do you regret that at all that you can't um 

468.27 471.28 A: do you sort of wish that they did have the family that you had 

471.33 477.45 B: um no i think it's just different i i wish we were closer because as everybody gets older 

473.52 474.43 A: mhm 

477.69 482.72 B: you know you need to start taking care of your parents or we're going to have to take care of each other and 

480.04 481.12 A: yeah 

482.04 483.10 A: mhm 

482.94 486.60 B: um i think it's it's hard um 

485.42 486.42 A: mhm 

486.98 489.13 B: when you have aging parents 

488.53 491.32 A: yeah yeah for sure 

491.48 494.75 A: my brother and i actually just sort of talked about that um 

495.52 506.21 A: he was he was living in he's an actor and he was in this is kind of fun talking to people that you know that you don't know about things that you don't normally talk to people about [laughter] 

502.05 504.36 B: [laughter] 

504.99 508.62 B: exactly because who is going to tell anybody you're not going to anybody right 

506.99 510.81 A: (( i know it's like what are you you know what are you go- yeah exactly who are you going to tell )) 

510.37 511.89 B: tell right 

510.92 517.27 A: um but it's you know if i ask some questions that you don't want to answer obviously you know i would understand um 

517.43 524.12 A: and vice versa you know if you feel like asking i'm generally like a pretty open person you know but feel free to sort of if there's something
