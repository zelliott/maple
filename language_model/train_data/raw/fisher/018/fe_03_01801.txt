0.32 1.36 A: hello 

1.07 3.10 B: hi i'm teresa 

2.68 7.48 A: hi my name is barry ah i guess the topic is computers in education 

6.91 8.33 B: absolutely 

8.37 23.36 A: um i think they're good ah i definitely think in terms of the internet ah how much research you can do ah in such a short time period ah you can pick up the information that ah ah would take you hours in a library to obtain 

24.17 24.99 B: hm 

25.27 31.32 B: barry i'm i'm sitting here in the library ah that's where i work and we use computers and ah 

31.45 45.10 B: right now we have adults and and children who are um a lot more interested in subjects that they didn't think about before because like you said they can easily you know find the research material on line i agree with you a hundred per cent 

45.91 50.56 A: ah the the we- ah or wealth of information plus ah 

50.57 52.79 A: for example if you buy a um 

53.10 66.76 A: an encyclopedia it becomes out of date unless you get ah ah new ah editions or ah to it but you can get you can you know ah belong to some encyclopedia ah 

61.16 62.06 B: yeah 

66.74 72.72 A: internet ah organization and you'll get the most up to date information ah each year 

72.35 85.91 B: i totally agree and um i like the tutorials that that come with the computers because we have ah little kids you know starting out from six years old who are completely computer ah literate because they could you know 

86.04 90.36 B: they could find study materials or find information on any topic 

90.43 91.35 B: um 

91.53 96.17 B: and it's also a a real good argument for like little kids on knowing how to read 

96.28 100.19 B: because you know every kid wants to play with a computer right 

100.43 101.39 B: um 

101.58 108.51 B: so the the very fact that they can read you know is is relevant um what part of the country are you in 

108.39 110.49 A: um i'm in atlanta georgia 

110.09 112.89 B: you're in atlanta georgia you sound like you're from new york [laughter] 

112.34 116.17 A: yeah well i am from new york [laughter] 

114.15 123.43 B: well see i moved here from new york and when i accessed the new york public library there you know they they didn't have computer when i moved here to tennessee 

123.49 130.85 B: but you know it it's exciting to see how many school kids you know and teachers come in here and use the library 

131.23 132.73 B: to access the internet 

133.77 136.98 A: well i think that's it's one of the most innovative ah 

137.16 143.74 A: um machines that have come over the last thirty or forty years because if you look back for example cars 

143.51 146.46 A: although certainly cars nowadays are more 

146.23 149.57 A: ah sophisticated they basically still 

149.39 162.88 A: you know if you had a thirty or forty year old car that was running it would still get you there but computers are completely ah you know wasn't around at all ah just a little while ago and now we run our spaceships on it and ah 

152.66 153.95 B: exactly 

162.81 166.67 A: the information as i said ah that you can get i mean you can look at the news 

166.66 176.66 A: and ah get completely up to date you can go to the stock market and ah get up to date quotes of course sometimes there may be a little bit of delay in a few minutes but ah 

170.73 171.60 B: mhm 

176.44 182.12 A: basically ah get a world to research on just about anything that you possibly could want 

181.50 185.64 B: i remember when i was in school and my teachers were always telling me 

185.54 200.40 B: ah when you didn't know how to spell a word or you didn't know how to pronounce a word you know ah go find a dictionary and look it up and and as a kid in school that was sort of discouraging but you get on the internet you look up miriam webster and and there it is 

200.49 205.38 B: ah you try to spell it and you have no idea they'll show you every variation of the word 

205.28 216.40 B: and ah the thing i like the most about that is if you have a sound card in your computer all you have to do is just you know click on the little sound icon and they will pronounce it for you you know 

216.06 218.00 A: that that i wasn't aware of 

217.65 220.97 B: oh it it's wonderful you know because 

219.38 225.52 A: i i i i'm a very poor speller and what i love is the spell check when i send an email 

224.98 227.07 B: spell check is terrific 

226.96 234.31 A: and ah they'll come up with you know if you mis spelt do you mean this or do you mean that and even correct your grammar along the way 

231.51 232.41 B: mhm 

234.79 237.08 B: i i like spell check myself mhm 

236.40 249.45 A: because you send something out and you don't and all of a sudden if you if you don't have the spell check on it you realize later god i don't believe i i wrote that [laughter] so incorrectly and it but the spell check picks up an awful lot 

249.26 258.37 B: well barry i remember back when i was in school you know ah if you really wanted to impress the teacher you would have your mom type out that book report for your teacher 

258.57 263.54 B: and like ah now here at davis library we have so many kids you know 

263.75 270.63 B: who who want to learn how to word process who want to learn how to type better who who spend time in the library im- improving their typing 

270.35 278.77 A: i remember when they used that little white out [laughter] people don't do that anymore they put them out of business 

273.31 274.89 B: oh yeah 

278.83 281.91 A: ah you can correct your own thing and ah 

281.86 295.73 A: in fact go back and use it as a template and and ah you know write something even over that sometimes ah you can go in and ah ah find stuff that parts of it and paste it and copy it and whatever you need to 

284.29 285.27 B: (( that's true )) 

295.20 296.28 B: mhm 

295.60 299.03 A: from one document to another document 

298.93 303.08 B: i feel like um computers in regards to education 

303.21 308.00 B: um it it's the closest thing to science fiction that i can even think about 

307.91 320.28 B: you know like back in the sixties they used to say well you would have subterranean houses now or you would have like so many innovations which have never come to pass and it took computers a while to get to um 

321.04 324.09 B: get compact enough for everybody to have them in their home 

324.18 326.72 B: and it took the prices a while to come down 

326.68 331.63 B: but the very fact that so many ah schools around the nation 

331.55 336.89 B: ah i don't know if you have that program in atlanta but they have it here in tennessee and i've seen it in surrounding states 

336.69 348.52 B: where ah stores will tell their customers if you bring in the receipts we will contribute you know a certain amount of funds to schools so they can afford computers i think that's terrific 

348.74 353.42 A: the only negative thing are all these spam and advertisements that you get 

353.02 354.33 B: the spamming 

353.23 365.77 A: sometimes [laughter] all these little pop up ads but um you know you can go ahead and actually get a a g._e._d. on line or even a ah college degree 

354.72 355.77 B: yeah 

363.42 364.86 B: (( i didn't know that )) 

365.37 368.60 B: i didn't know you could get your g._d._n. g._e._d. on line 

368.18 377.43 A: i i think so at least i know the college part you can because i i get these emails all the time that you can have a home study course and do a lot of it on the computer 

371.29 372.39 B: cool well 

377.60 384.41 B: you've inspired me to actually do a search on getting your g._e._d. on line 'cause ah i have a friend who's looking to get his g._e._d. 

380.94 381.87 A: [laughter] 

384.68 393.23 A: i may be i i have to say there i may have misspoke on the g._e._d. but i know for college i get these emails all the time where you can ah 

393.00 401.46 A: do your course work and i i assume at some point you you might have to go there and take the test or something like that but i'm not sure i've never done it that way 

393.32 395.00 B: phoenix university 

400.07 408.77 B: well i i think that you can go to any college if you're doing like an on line thing you can go to any college and have them act as a proctor so you can take the paper test 

408.97 412.15 B: you know 'cause i've taken some correspondence courses 

413.38 415.29 B: um hm 

416.29 419.46 B: we have ah seven computers here at the library 

419.54 425.82 B: and and i have to tell you the the kids are more excited about the computers than they are the books 

425.54 429.12 A: do you control what they can pick up on the internet 

428.55 434.53 B: ah yeah we have the four or five ah computers which access the internet 

434.55 436.24 B: we have um 

436.36 438.59 B: certain controls set up 

439.04 445.52 B: but i have busted you know a twelve year old trying to pick up chicks on a chat room he's permanently banned 

443.71 450.43 A: [laughter] what'd he say he was twenty one [laughter] usually the old men are trying to pick up the young girls 

447.14 448.82 B: you can't take 

450.13 456.59 B: you can't no it was a young boy trying to pick up adult women so it goes both ways you can't change human nature 

454.89 457.19 A: god he's a little advanced for his age 

457.35 459.35 B: you can't change human nature [laughter] 

458.99 461.65 A: [laughter] that surprises me 

461.84 464.56 B: well you got to admire his ingenuity 

464.93 465.98 B: you know 

464.94 468.91 A: well i guess you yeah i guess that yeah that's possible 

468.14 471.15 B: you know i'm not tickled to death with him but ah 

471.76 474.76 B: [sigh] computers open doors 

474.58 478.60 A: and i think you even get an education ah when you go to some place 

478.64 480.01 A: ah like ebay 

479.79 480.88 B: yeah 

480.27 483.51 A: ah where you start looking at items that are for sale 

483.46 484.35 B: true 

483.64 489.02 A: and and there are things that you never even knew even existed and ah 

488.94 500.59 A: when you buy something ah it's kind of ah pushes you to find out more about it so ah it leads ah to you ah to research it and 

498.78 510.14 B: that brings up a valid point barry even if you're not using your computer for education you get one anyway 'cause let's say you're looking up something like what kind of butterfly is eating my plant in the garden 

510.30 520.44 B: it'll lead you to you know like mountains of information you didn't think you needed to know like what kinds of plant the butterfly won't eat or where the butterfly comes from 

520.61 524.18 B: it educates you going from one subject to the next 

524.16 537.80 A: and and when you go for example and and a simple thing like ah maybe paying your taxes or paying your water bill you go on site and or or you start to learn much more about your sewers or ah whatever ever information they have there 

537.66 546.52 A: because ah ah they built the site to ah to educate their customers so they won't complain about the you know the cost sometimes 

543.27 544.61 B: absolutely 

546.65 557.88 B: um i have a friend who ah sent me a link around christmastime i don't know if you seen this or not it was president bush's scottie dog it had a little camera on it as it went through the white house 

558.17 570.83 B: you know and the scottie dog's name was barney and i remember thinking what is barney cam right so as when i clicked on this link i found out that the white house has their own web site which i did not know 

570.67 576.09 A: oh definitely i'm i'm sure in fact i'm sure every senator and representative has a web site 

575.96 581.79 B: um i've been spending some time writing to our senators here in tennessee about the environment 

581.79 593.82 B: and i think it's cool that like you know kids who feel strongly about an issue can not only research it but actually send a letter to george bush and a letter to the white house and a letter to the representatives of the state 

593.80 597.10 B: um it it don't get any better than that 

596.74 599.89 A: well the other thing i like and this may be slightly off the
