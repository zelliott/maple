136.86 138.55 B: their way or no way 

138.33 145.10 A: yeah i'm not a computer person generally i don't like them and i i too find them just tedious they're so 

144.89 156.72 A: literal minded and you have to yeah d- as you say they have you've got to dot every i and cross every t and go through every little tidgy step i find them tedious in the extreme and 

156.65 170.06 A: and i'm not comfortable with them i too am of a generation where we didn't have them and i don't particularly like them but for the kind of you know endless boring stuff that language entails they're they're just priceless 

159.99 160.80 B: [laughter] 

167.43 168.61 B: yeah 

170.60 174.47 B: and and they're they're my um my son for a while um

183.60 187.81 B: there's a lot of things where it worked really great um 

188.13 188.96 B: (( ah )) 

189.67 193.05 B: and ah especially with spelling and um 

193.82 194.50 B: (( ah ))

197.39 199.46 A: mhm mhm 

204.29 205.42 B: but um 

207.20 216.35 A: i do a lot of research nowadays in my work and ah i also just love it for for the incredible convenience 

210.67 211.39 B: (( um uh-huh )) 

216.68 228.52 A: you know i remember as a graduate student you know having to use an old fashioned library with card catalogs and just just feeling how how difficult it was to to 

228.58 233.41 A: just physically get hold of the information i needed and and how i 

233.45 234.24 A: how 

234.26 237.33 A: threatened and frightened i felt at at 

237.95 245.63 A: just just feeling that i never was getting to the bottom of things and the internet is such a joy both for the ease 

245.63 253.08 A: and and the feeling of of being able to get to the bottom of things of of being able to to put your finger on 

253.18 263.60 A: if you work hard at it all the information that's ever been gathered on a on any arcane topic that that you can conceive of 

264.74 267.09 A: i mean if you gotta find a 

267.16 273.13 A: an octagonal leopard skin covered pool table that exists 

273.14 278.27 A: somewhere in the world you're probably gonna be able to find the location of the darn thing through the internet 

278.70 280.18 B: yep you're right 

279.84 285.70 A: and [laughter] you know in a library with with paper it's gonna be a 

285.93 286.92 A: (( task )) 

287.46 298.08 A: [laughter] you know you gotta go through inter library loan and the card catalog and you know x. million number of indices and even the librarians won't know how to help you half the time 

298.40 304.90 A: and the internet is such a joy for that and and that's that's revolutionized education 

305.24 310.16 B: yeah ah for education it it i i think it really is the 

310.36 316.54 B: well for all ways but ah in a lot of ways but but education especially it's ah 

316.71 318.55 B: i think a really good um 

319.32 321.46 B: um medium and in um 

321.84 328.95 B: in in you know in the classrooms for elementary and ah high school and middle school

330.73 332.32 B: you know it's really um 

333.71 335.05 B: makes it it 

335.16 340.94 B: i this gene- the generation that's in school now and you know the grades i just mentioned 

341.07 342.89 B: they seem to be 

343.95 345.69 B: born with a 

346.58 352.17 B: able to interface with a computer much better than in our older generation 

351.96 357.01 A: mhm how old was your son when he started learning to use the computer 

352.75 353.62 B: you know 

357.47 361.35 B: well i mean before the computer he was playing video games 

361.10 363.01 A: mhm 

361.96 365.21 B: and so he probably started doing that when he was 

365.59 366.54 B: seven 

366.75 367.84 A: really 

367.06 368.47 B: six or seven 

368.58 374.20 B: and he started using the computer maybe two years ago at about age ten 

374.27 378.02 A: what did he learn first handwriting or typing i'm curious 

378.28 379.65 B: (( well ah )) 

378.86 381.85 A: you know in in terms of motor skills 

379.82 384.46 B: to be honest he he to be honest he doesn't really know how to type on it 

384.28 385.24 A: uh-huh 

385.00 386.83 B: completely so ah 

386.15 387.91 A: yeah 

386.88 388.08 B: but um 

388.97 392.51 B: he can figure out things that i can't you know 

391.68 393.54 A: mhm 

392.57 393.58 B: ah just 

393.68 396.39 B: he can look at the screen and 

396.92 402.41 B: just ah he just has is adept at it and i think a lot of kids nowadays are ah 

404.72 406.48 B: they can you know they can 

407.94 410.97 B: they're more in tune with the technology 

409.32 410.48 A: mhm 

411.27 412.48 B: and um 

412.51 416.23 B: with the speed that it it can go at also 

416.78 417.54 B: um 

417.98 427.56 A: how was how has the computer influenced teaching reading and and writing in your experience with with a child 

427.55 429.39 B: well um 

430.34 433.38 B: it has hasn't helped him so far 

433.41 435.43 B: as far as writing goes 

435.55 438.62 A: yeah i mean you don't write when you use a computer that's 

437.76 438.35 B: (( yeah )) 

439.31 445.02 A: i mean you obviously write intellectually but you don't pra- you know you don't use your hand to write at all 

445.14 445.99 B: no 

446.12 447.12 B: and ah 

447.67 448.85 B: his um 

449.33 451.97 B: handwriting is definitely not um 

453.13 458.62 B: it needs it needs a lot leaves a lot to be desired and um i don't think um 

459.62 460.46 B: um 

462.43 464.96 B: well my son's probably not a good example 

465.16 471.38 B: [laughter] ah school is something that he has to get out of the way to play he doesn't have that desire to learn yet 

468.93 470.07 A: mhm 

471.05 472.89 A: mhm mhm 

472.32 477.57 B: oh um he does but it's not a priority there's other things he'd much rather do so 

474.99 476.75 A: (( yeah )) 

477.77 483.05 B: um and we're working on that but it doesn't really involve the computer so 

485.01 485.73 A: (( well )) 

485.08 486.15 B: (( ah um )) 

486.02 491.46 A: different different people different human being i think you know have different ways of learning and different 

490.90 492.20 B: exactly 

491.39 503.48 A: subjects they're interested in learning about i remember i'm not you know an academic and a researcher by nature but for example i remember that i was very slow by my parents' light 

503.35 515.46 A: ah to read and and when i thought about it as an adult i remembered that gee the reading books i was given were so dull look there was no reason why i would want to read them i mean see dick run 

513.43 516.55 B: yeah dick and jane yeah [laughter] 

515.69 520.54 A: was was so boring that why would i want to read that if someone would read to me 

520.61 523.02 A: what they would read was so much [laughter] more interesting 

523.13 524.26 A: (( but there )) 

524.28 525.67 B: yeah and 

525.19 527.32 A: was no reason for me to read 

527.45 529.38 A: and so why bother 

529.71 534.62 A: you know if they'd of given me something that aroused my curiosity i might have been a lot faster to read 

532.55 534.39 B: yeah your imagination 

535.09 536.87 B: yeah you're right exactly 

536.47 541.22 A: um you know and so i i don't take a lot of frankly what what you know 

541.32 550.75 A: people you know worry about my kid in grade school doesn't you know or even high school doesn't like school well he you know give him something he wants to learn 

551.55 558.74 A: that's taught in school and he'll be all excited about it and maybe what he wants to learn is not what's being taught in 

559.04 561.39 A: you know eight thirty to three thirty 

561.30 563.14 B: right and 

562.04 568.75 A: and so doesn't mean he's dumb or lazy it just means he's learning in a different way 

568.91 574.42 A: than what's being offered in a classroom at this point in his life [laughter] 

573.96 575.78 B: and it's interesting 

574.65 576.61 A: or with a computer 

576.91 579.53 B: it's interesting that you mentioned ah learning 

579.85 586.68 B: ah ways that kids learn because ah we're in the process of taking him out of public school and putting him a montessori school 

586.33 587.25 A: (( [laughter] mm )) 

587.10 593.72 B: because ah he they just don't well the classes are too big and they just don't um 

594.57 599.89 B: you know they aren't able to work with them in the ways that he learns that he 

596.99 598.07 A: yeah
