20.36 22.89 A: so what does family mean to you [laughter]

43.96 46.75 A: who's there at all times 

45.85 59.85 B: right 'cause we have [mn] people in our family i mean people that have been like remarried and you have like stepkids or but we have like relatives that i don't even know how we're related but technically we're related but [laughter] [mn] but um 

55.45 57.20 A: yeah exactly 

58.03 62.08 A: yeah i mean i consider family you know whoever is there 

62.23 64.61 A: for me or whoever i'm there for

66.37 67.32 B: right 

70.17 84.70 B: and more specifically i guess um you know the people you come home to every day the people that see you at your worst and your best and the people that you tell things to that you wouldn't tell anybody else [laughter] ask for help with your problems and 

76.46 77.34 A: (( yep )) 

81.02 82.66 A: exactly

454.51 455.67 A: oh i know 

455.39 460.40 B: you know i mean that could be that could take up your whole day just reading all the communications 

458.56 461.94 A: well if it wasn't for my computer i don't know how i would talk to my daughter 

462.32 467.30 A: 'cause i couldn't afford to call arizona all the time but we're talk- we talk constantly on here 

462.70 464.22 B: well that's a good thing 

464.52 466.18 B: yeah really 

467.58 469.61 A: on the computer all the time 

468.94 473.00 B: yeah that- that's a good thing that's one good thing about having it 

472.69 474.07 A: oh yeah like 

473.26 478.70 B: sometimes there's just too much information now and i'm on it every single day at work and at home so

479.30 482.23 B: no i'm not at work now i just got home but 

481.56 482.26 A: (( ah )) 

482.31 486.94 B: but yeah i mean it's just like it's so much information i mean i go to college too 

486.78 497.89 B: and then when i'm trying to do something it can never be concise you know i mean yeah it's nice not having to go out to the library so i shouldn't be [laughter] i should be grateful but at the same time um 

494.46 495.78 A: right 

497.82 499.09 B: you know i 

498.90 512.89 B: it's just so much information you could be there forever searching and searching but but another good thing about having family online [laughter] or friends that are family is i have a friend that does home schooling actually she's the one that told me about this thing 

510.53 511.54 A: mhm 

512.72 518.82 B: um and so she has to look up a lot of information for her children you know for teaching them different things 

517.28 519.90 A: right i did that with my daughter 

519.67 523.96 B: oh really oh wow see i didn't do that but i had um 

520.17 522.82 A: i did home schooling yeah 

523.77 538.32 B: you know my son had this thing to do and i'm like searching on the internet and i can't find what i want you know i just wasn't having much luck and it was really stressing me out and and then ah you know i happened to mention it to my friend you know just saying oh my gosh i got to do this and la du da du da 

531.41 532.77 A: mhm 

538.06 539.63 A: it took her thirty seconds mhm 

538.16 539.07 B: and 

538.94 548.02 B: and yeah she's like oh here let me email you this and she gives me this link and it had all these things about science projects it was grade appropriate 

545.66 546.60 A: oh 

547.88 556.71 B: and ah it was so awesome i was like oh my gosh you made my day you made my week [laughter] because i could have been on there forever searching for that 

553.22 554.12 A: (( yeah )) 

556.78 561.86 B: i think that some of the stuff that they have these kids do today is just unbelievable 

561.78 563.02 A: really i mean 

562.91 565.06 B: what's that beeping is that you
