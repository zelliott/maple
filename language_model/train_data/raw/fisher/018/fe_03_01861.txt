1.52 3.43 A: hi i'm teresa 

3.10 5.34 B: hi teresa i'm larry 

4.99 6.32 A: hi larry 

7.05 18.38 A: oh well i worked in the schools as a substitute teachers and i actually actually got to work in the computer lab but i do know that kids enjoy them a lot and they um 

18.45 20.24 A: learn quite a bit from them 

21.80 25.96 B: so ah did you ah teach or do anything with word processing 

25.80 27.11 A: ah yes we did 

27.18 28.48 A: we did 

29.16 42.80 B: have you ever considered what the difference between a kid that had a hard time learning to spell the old fashioned way and a new fashioned way where he has a word processor with a spell checker 

42.76 48.76 B: so that instantly he knows which word is misspelled rather than not even knowing which word 

49.02 51.84 B: is misspelled to look up beforehand 

51.43 52.76 A: [laughter] 

52.16 54.08 B: [laughter] 

53.08 55.35 A: it definitely spoils you 

55.41 63.35 B: yeah well it spoils you i ah i had a a real hard time when i was in grade school i injured my hands really bad 

55.68 57.71 A: [laughter] 

63.06 63.97 A: uh-huh 

63.19 70.65 B: and in the second third and fourth grade i missed probably two thirds of the time i don't remember learning spelling 

67.66 68.61 A: uh-huh 

70.48 71.73 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

70.60 80.20 B: so i've always been a horrible speller and and when you're a horrible speller you don't know which word is spelt wrong to look it up to see 

79.53 81.21 A: exactly both of my 

81.76 94.77 A: are like that they don't they're not good spellers at all and you can my dad always used to tell me get the dictionary well when you don't have an idea what the second letter is going to be that's not helpful is it [laughter] 

89.42 90.57 B: really 

92.49 99.99 B: yeah yeah there's a lot of words with is and es in them that you have to guess whether 

98.59 99.55 A: right 

100.12 101.63 B: (( you know )) 

102.23 112.14 B: whether it's i. e. a. i. e. d. or e. d. you know you know and um you can spend a lot of time in the dictionary but i have since i started using ah 

105.09 106.14 A: right 

112.27 116.06 B: a word processor my spelling has improved a hundred per cent 

115.35 126.96 A: [laughter] uh-huh and and i think you can still learn from it because when i misspell a word and i you know and it pops up and tells me and then i always spend a little extra time looking at it trying to remember it for next time 

127.28 128.33 A: but ah 

127.60 131.86 B: you've got a you've got a beautiful accent did you know that [laughter] 

130.29 134.30 A: oh no i didn't [laughter] it's a southern accent i guess 

133.47 138.73 B: i was gonna suggest maybe texas or something but [laughter] 

135.61 139.87 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

139.24 140.73 B: where are you from 

140.32 141.66 A: alabama 

141.48 145.15 B: alabama well that's close to texas [laughter] 

143.35 149.27 A: well yeah that's close [laughter] we have about the same accent i think pretty much 

148.49 155.05 B: but you know kids can get carried away in school on computers and waste time 

154.47 155.86 A: absolutely 

155.12 159.24 B: they they need to learn how to do the old fashioned research 

159.07 160.56 A: (( i agree mhm mhm )) 

160.01 163.71 B: and they should stay away from computers when they're doing research 

164.09 167.71 B: um math computers i think are wonderful 

168.08 177.78 B: my wife is well she's a physical a pediatric physical therapist but years ago she went to work for the school system and she works with ah 

175.26 176.29 A: uh-huh 

178.05 182.66 B: with severe handicapped all the way to mildly handicapped kids 

182.10 183.29 A: (( uh-huh mhm mhm uh-huh )) 

182.85 192.33 B: and ah she has there's two or three situations one in particular you got a thirteen year old boy that can neither see nor hear an hold it 

192.45 193.31 B: (( no )) 

194.56 199.94 B: he has to be able to see but anyhow oh he's a quadriplegic 

200.07 213.96 B: and his his skills were no he didn't have any skills whatsoever and they came up with a thing that there's a monitor that there's a a device that sits on top of the monitor and then he wears a 

214.00 221.98 B: a kind of a headset thing with straps and stuff and i believe it's an infrared thing that shines at the monitor 

221.94 231.93 B: and ah whatever windows application is on there he can move his head around and it will move the cursor around on the monitor 

231.34 232.43 A: (( wow )) 

231.85 239.83 B: and when his head comes to a stop for more than a programmed period of time it's the same thing as clicking on a mouse 

240.32 241.76 A: (( oh wow )) 

240.92 241.67 B: so 

241.83 251.32 B: so this kid went from from a young person that's very bright actually ah but had but was living in a in a 

247.05 248.19 A: mhm 

251.17 265.82 B: in a in an envelope where he had no stimulation of any kind whatsoever no communication couldn't talk couldn't ah i think he couldn't talk that was what it was but he was quadriplegic that could but anyway all of a sudden he learned the language 

260.98 262.04 A: (( mhm uh-huh )) 

265.40 266.46 A: oh 

265.85 269.15 B: and all the next thing you know he was he was communicating 

268.95 283.67 B: they'd start off with what do you want for lunch you know and go down through different layers of windows but ah he finally learned how to use a word processor and he'll never probably never be able to hold down a job anywhere but 

272.23 273.20 A: uh-huh 

283.46 290.01 B: it made a happy person out of somebody that was just just completely bored and couldn't communicate you know 

288.11 289.49 A: absolutely 

289.72 303.13 A: wow that's amazing they just don't teach like they used to do you know they don't teach spelling in school i have one that's eighteen years old who can't spell never did a book report or an essay 

291.11 292.17 B: (( [sigh] )) 

292.73 293.67 B: so 

297.37 299.09 B: that's right 

303.31 309.98 A: except for when what he did research on the computer and then you just print out what you want to print out you don't research it you just find it and print it 

303.75 304.72 B: (( well )) 

308.87 312.59 B: that's right and and you use somebody else's 

312.15 313.11 A: right 

313.11 317.08 B: cognitive thinking and everything so yeah 

314.00 314.97 A: (( uh-huh )) 

315.65 320.79 A: i mean they don't even teach kids how to study anymore it's frustrating for parents i can tell you that [laughter]

354.40 368.07 B: and she had a a monitor for the older kids somebody that would rat on anybody that played up but ah anyhow she did all the the course scheduling and everything all herself she wasn't married 

359.67 360.79 A: uh-huh 

367.89 382.57 B: and by the time those kids out of there came out of there they could absolutely diagram a sentence they were all skilled at at ah i don't think they went above algebra but if they took ah they could pass any test that they're asking today 

377.98 378.94 A: uh-huh 

383.37 384.45 A: wow 

383.85 386.08 B: that kids are taking today 

385.42 386.59 A: uh-huh

392.74 396.48 B: and ah all heck would break loose [laughter] 

393.58 394.76 A: and the parents 

395.44 398.46 A: uh-huh that's it exactly [laughter] 

398.04 411.61 B: there was no such thing as slothfulness if you tried hard and couldn't do it that was one thing but if you didn't turn in something ah number one ah that you were a public publicly ridiculed about it because with you know

454.91 456.94 A: (( yeah that's right )) 

457.90 462.49 B: you cannot teach somebody that refuses to learn how anything

566.59 577.14 A: no i mean here i mean it's just like they have the code of conduct you have to sign that you read it as a parent and as a student and then nothing in the book is enforced 

577.23 578.20 B: yep 

577.36 591.26 A: there's two schools here that have good principals i mean these principals rule the school but that's the only two schools and when you go over there to substitute you have no problem nobody back talks nobody did anything wrong 

591.02 592.48 B: well that's nice 

591.95 599.89 A: totally i mean so you know it depends on who's running the school for one thing and a lot of the principals around here just don't give a flying flip anymore
