61.73 64.81 A: already that's wonderful that's wonderful 

64.78 68.03 B: right [lipsmack] so yeah i i think they're a great idea 

67.42 71.23 A: [noise] yeah i think they're they're good my daughter goes to she's in ah 

71.29 73.41 A: gifted program at school 

73.73 79.98 A: that um you know they do a lot of things on the computer but more creative than educational right now 

80.46 81.49 A: but ah 

81.92 88.31 A: i always say i keep saying for m- i i work for an attorney's office and i know that there's just so many things 

88.84 91.42 A: in the computer system that i don't even know

97.30 98.60 B: [laughter] 

99.41 101.00 A: [noise] so basically she 

101.51 105.08 A: i think they use them almost every day in school you know 

103.62 104.93 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

106.16 108.55 A: [noise] but [lipsmack] i think it's a wonderful idea [noise] [noise] 

108.33 115.31 B: [noise] i do too the only thing that that bothers me is them not being able to 

116.81 120.44 B: if they depend on them so much that they can't um 

120.62 122.72 B: do things um 

122.76 124.23 B: in their head 

123.50 125.14 A: [mn] right right 

124.93 131.21 B: or like look up something in a dictionary or or a thesaurus themselves 

127.89 129.03 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

130.00 133.16 A: there's no more going to the library and doing your reports 

133.07 134.11 B: right 

133.28 138.04 A: you know basically they do most of it most of the research at home now 

138.25 148.13 B: right and times that's good because parent a lot of times don't have time to take them you know if if you have a two two parent working family 

143.02 144.33 A: (( you know [noise] exactly )) 

147.50 148.41 A: right 

148.85 156.18 B: you know and you have kids who need to go to the library after school um it it is really hard um 

151.21 152.67 A: [noise] yeah sure 

154.19 155.10 A: yeah 

156.37 159.67 B: so i guess that is a double edged sword 

159.02 160.13 A: mhm 

159.92 162.32 B: kind of because it's a good idea mhm 

161.65 163.30 A: i mean i know when i was younger y- 

163.48 168.34 A: i could just go to the library by myself at that age and think nothing of it i don't think i would 

168.67 170.82 A: really want her to be there by herself 

170.99 174.01 A: (( you know you know and like you said if i'm working )) 

171.47 172.54 B: right 

174.58 180.95 A: and then come home from work to make dinner and go to the library after work [laughter] and i have a two year old 

178.94 180.03 B: right 

181.30 182.28 B: (( oh )) 

181.54 182.79 A: (( [laughter] you know )) 

182.39 184.04 B: that makes it hard 

183.22 185.45 A: yeah yeah she's 

184.72 188.92 B: that that doesn't make it very easy for you it makes it convenient for you to 

187.94 188.88 A: it does 

189.08 193.35 B: to not have to take your two year old out also 

191.93 192.83 A: (( [noise] right )) 

194.04 195.07 B: um 

195.86 197.69 B: i just 

198.44 204.45 B: i just don't want a generation of um people who don't know how to add things 

202.00 203.66 A: that that's all they know 

204.46 206.82 B: or subtract things and you know 

207.42 209.30 B: that they always depend on 

207.73 215.27 A: [noise] [noise] right right because that's all they know you know now especially if you're just starting school now basically 

210.04 212.35 B: on a machine they consider 

215.73 216.76 B: right 

216.10 223.11 A: you know because i remember when she started i think she was like in second grade when they first started it and she was you know so upset that she couldn't type 

223.91 227.43 A: and now three years later she can type almost just as fast as i can [noise] 

227.34 228.37 B: [noise] oh wow 

227.76 230.01 A: (( yeah yeah you know )) 

230.05 237.52 A: so that that way i mean they're definitely they're definitely learning a lot from it [mn] and in our school they said you know they sent a letter home 

237.54 241.56 A: if you want permission for your child to go on the internet 

241.97 246.41 A: for certain things like i i guess some parents don't want their kids on the internet at all 

246.85 247.90 B: (( mhm right )) 

247.25 251.43 A: you know and of course the school says that they you know they block anything 

252.03 259.63 A: that they shouldn't be going into but i mean i know from just having the computer here even though she's blocked there's things that pop up on the computer that she shouldn't see 

259.71 261.18 B: exactly 

259.76 272.75 A: [noise] and that's that sets that the worse part it's like i have to be you know i have to check on all the time just to see where she's going or if somebody you know she'll be talking to someone one night and i'm like well whose this person i don't know they just instant messaged me 

266.08 267.09 B: right 

272.83 274.97 A: (( i said then you say good bye to them right now )) 

275.48 279.22 A: you know you don't know who you're talking to yeah yeah 

275.74 276.30 B: (( [mn] )) 

276.31 280.96 B: that is scary yeah and i'm i don't know 

281.09 284.84 B: if they're allowed to do that at school or not 

283.40 287.27 A: [noise] i don't think they are i don't think they have the instant message or anything 

285.62 286.60 B: um 

286.84 291.77 B: i don't think i would like it because i don't think if as you said i don't think that 

291.82 293.72 B: one teacher could 

294.06 295.08 B: um 

295.15 298.98 B: where thirty children are 

295.84 297.55 A: [noise] yeah keep an eye on 

297.92 300.25 A: ah exactly exactly 

299.41 301.70 B: at one time and what's on their screen 

301.16 307.28 A: right right i know that they you know they they had meetings about it and everything even before they would 

307.64 315.77 A: allow any sort of internet access at the school you know and then there were there were parents that that no they didn't want their children to be it on at all and they said fine you know 

315.93 318.85 A: then your child won't definitely be on a computer that had one 

319.45 320.40 A: (( you know )) 

321.61 323.45 B: [noise] i think that's a good idea 

322.88 324.81 A: yeah yeah definitely [noise] 

324.14 328.16 B: you know i know even with my seventeen year old when she's on the computer i 

328.36 332.38 B: i stop by and look and what she's what she's doing on it 

329.46 333.01 A: (( yeah oh yeah and see so what yeah yeah [noise] [noise] yeah no )) 

334.59 337.21 B: because you don't know people 

336.51 337.39 A: you don't 

337.23 338.55 B: you know [laughter] 

338.08 339.04 A: you don't know 

339.09 343.44 A: they think they're chatting with another teenager and are it's a forty year old guy you know 

343.47 345.67 A: (( you just hear of too many nightmare stories )) 

343.50 344.76 B: right

366.82 367.72 A: okay 

367.79 371.30 A: mm that keeps you busy i'm sure now do you use the computer yourself 

369.09 369.97 B: (( oh yeah )) 

370.62 372.32 B: one granddaughter [laughter] 

371.72 374.11 A: oh really oh wow how old is she

380.13 381.64 B: oh she's great 

380.98 389.05 A: you know but he'll sit he'll sit on my daughter's lap when you know when she'll go into like sesame street and stuff like that and he he already wants to be on the computer 

389.20 394.36 A: you know so it's by the time they go to preschool nowadays they probably do know how to use the computer 

394.81 395.80 A: (( you know )) 

396.37 398.57 B: mhm yeah i've seen some small ones 

398.74 406.42 B: um you know for toddlers that are called my first computer or something like that and i wondered about buying her one 

401.03 401.96 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

403.18 404.16 A: right 

405.77 406.86 A: mhm 

407.09 408.36 A: that that that's probably 

407.41 414.34 B: you know does does it get her ahead you know does she have an advantage if she uses it you know when she goes to school 

409.52 411.10 A: right right 

413.89 421.14 A: yeah [noise] and probably will because you know nowadays if you don't put your children in preschool by the time they get to kindergarten they're behind 

421.18 426.89 A: you know they're teaching them how to [mn] almost read before they even get to kindergarten some children 

427.29 428.37 B: yep 

427.58 428.83 A: you know so 

428.96 432.11 A: i mean i think it's gonna be a very computer based world 

431.85 434.30 B: (( [mn] [noise] it is and i think of [mn] )) 

432.69 438.29 A: even i mean it is so much more you know and i know there is so much more there to learn but 

438.60 442.37 A: i can't fit that into my schedule [laughter] but i would love to learn more 

442.17 443.22 B: right 

442.38 443.50 A: (( you know [mn] [mn] )) 

443.57 446.49 B: well i was kinda forced to because um 

446.61 448.98 B: i'm disabled and i'm i um 

449.59 454.22 B: i'm not able to work outside my home so the income that i do make is now off the internet 

451.07 451.82 A: okay 

453.73 454.72 A: okay 

454.56 455.98 B: [noise] and um 

456.87 463.97 B: that was you know people find that fascinating that i'm able to earn any kind of income off the internet [mn] 

461.82 466.65 A: sure sure do you do all different kinds of things like that this 

466.60 467.76 B: um 

467.89 472.67 B: yeah [noise] yeah um b- but a lot of different things 

468.29 469.25 A: yeah 

472.08 473.55 A: right right [noise] 

472.86 473.68 B: so 

475.35 477.07 B: um but um 

478.74 481.38 B: i think computers in school 

481.68 483.42 B: are a great idea 

482.65 485.84 A: (( oh [mn] you have to there them nowadays you know )) 

484.98 485.83 B: um 

486.34 487.59 A: you really do 

488.07 488.95 B: (( ah )) 

488.99 490.67 A: (( and )) 

489.07 492.20 B: i i think the children who don't are going to be 

492.26 494.65 B: behind in the in the real world 

493.02 497.84 A: absolutely absolutely and i'm sure there is a lot of schools out there that don't have them 

498.14 499.04 A: (( you know )) 

498.19 500.14 B: because of money issues 

499.47 501.64 A: right right you 

500.93 506.28 B: you know it's not cheap to set up um i'm sure it is not cheap to set up a network you know for each school oh were ruined 

504.68 514.80 A: know oh not at all yeah no it's got to be very expensive and if you you don't have the money in your budget you know or you just heard something on t._v. on 

514.99 516.08 A: (( [mn] )) 

516.20 525.10 A: long island new york and they just said a school you know not not too close but they they just had four hundred thousand dollars worth of vandalism or their computers 

523.69 525.93 B: (( yeah right so you know how long that is going to take )) 

526.13 526.88 A: (( my )) 

527.27 527.94 A: (( gosh )) 

527.31 530.16 B: em that's a i mean that's almost half a million dollars 

528.94 530.93 A: right right yeah 

530.31 533.37 B: you know that is a lot of money 

531.09 531.88 A: so 

532.68 537.43 A: you know that's gonna be all all those children you know who knows how long it's going to take them to ah 

537.85 540.24 A: to get that money back to the get the computers so 

540.11 542.87 B: but the the children 

543.13 548.80 B: who you know don't have them in their schools because their school systems are poor like 

548.06 548.82 A: (( right )) 

548.81 552.14 B: in the hills of virginia um 

550.05 551.04 A: right 

552.57 557.53 B: you know places that are kind of backwards still and we do have a lot of places like that still 

556.95 557.93 A: yeah 

557.81 561.25 B: and in the united states even though it's kinda unbelievable 

560.41 562.18 A: sure sure 

561.45 562.39 B: um 

562.53 568.39 B: but um i know several people who i've who i've talked to on on online 

567.97 568.91 A: right 

568.51 580.18 B: you know um their church has dir- a dirt floor you know you know um she's she's posted pictures of some of the homes around there and you know and they're they're shacks 

571.63 572.60 A: wow 

572.62 573.60 A: wow 

579.52 580.46 A: wow 

580.51 584.37 B: and some of them don't have running water some of them don't have electricity 

582.85 584.13 A: oh my goodness 

584.65 585.91 B: and it's 

585.46 591.08 A: so they probably have no clue what they're even missing because they don't know about it sure 

587.39 591.94 B: right and how far behind are their children gonna be 

591.21 592.63 A: exactly 

592.04 597.63 B: when they go out into the real word an- and how much of a chance are they going to have to get out of there 

596.55 599.89 A: right right well that's it that's a cycle that repeats itself
