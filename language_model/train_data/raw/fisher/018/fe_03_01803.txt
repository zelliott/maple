69.66 71.10 A: yeah 

73.43 74.66 A: without it 

74.32 80.28 B: um you know there's so much information out there on the on the internet and stuff too 

80.37 81.41 A: right 

81.69 85.31 A: and you can learn so much i know that we're taking um a 

85.15 99.77 A: an employee and i are taking um some classes tomorrow at the library they're free and they have like m._s. word and um different um computer classes they offer every month at no cost yeah and they were like two dollar i'm sorry like two hours a class 

94.63 95.79 B: oh cool 

99.40 100.40 B: oh gosh

107.47 109.88 B: oh i me too [laughter] 

108.73 120.07 A: really but you know there's a lot of little um tricks and things that you can learn like how to use your icons on your toolbar and i did not know you know when i would want to copy and paste i would go there to to edit 

120.00 127.93 A: and you know do the long way and so when i took an intro to word class a few weeks ago i discovered that the icon's right there i just have to click on it 

128.54 134.23 A: so it it really going to i guess my point is going to those classes um really helped 

134.40 138.11 A: um educate me on on what i'm doing and stuff 

137.93 146.32 B: yeah i do all you know like most of my reports and stuff are done over the internet so i would be just totally lost [laughter] without my computer 

146.10 147.28 A: right 

146.82 149.70 B: and i yeah i taught myself too so 

150.36 155.25 B: and i think kids today if they don't have a computer they're gonna be way behind in 

150.38 151.31 A: (( yeah well )) 

154.66 168.63 A: i know you know the kid my son though he's ah sixteen he's in high school he had takes computer tech um or business business well takes computer tech and um applications and um computer

172.49 175.05 B: oh i can imagine [laughter] 

174.00 181.24 A: the kids that come out of school today they know powerpoint and i mean just like even in junior high they know powerpoint and they know um

190.11 192.91 A: i don't know um near what he does 

193.32 196.76 A: but i've been taking some classes just to you know try to learn 

197.20 199.18 A: um a little bit 

197.85 204.19 B: that's neat though that the library holds them like that that is yeah that's bound to help [laughter] 

203.52 214.71 A: yeah it does and then you know our um junior um college here our community college um they offer um ah they would have like their tech- technology center they offer like i guess i told you that i'm from tulsa 

214.56 216.15 B: no oh cool 

215.44 217.30 A: yeah so where are you from 

216.81 218.30 B: i'm from kentucky

221.54 224.28 B: (( [laughter] this is this is do )) 

222.50 223.42 A: (( yeah so )) 

223.43 233.06 A: yeah our um technology department are or colleges they offer some classes and then we have the park association they offer computer classes too 

233.09 236.11 A: but now theirs are not free but they're pretty inexpensive 

236.29 239.21 A: but it's nice that the library offers the free ones 

236.44 237.59 B: you get 

238.71 244.75 B: yeah i think i think i'll check into that and see if i can find something here [laughter] to educate myself 

242.70 243.38 A: (( [cough] )) 

244.94 249.41 A: yeah if you live in a um a major city then i'm sure your library

252.05 253.84 A: oh well you know 

253.21 260.21 B: but you know the and that's one thing i think's neat you know we have like one library here and so you know if the kids have 

260.44 262.62 B: you know if they have computers and stuff 

262.99 263.89 B: they can 

263.18 266.73 A: well if you're in a small town they might not offer it i guess but 

265.75 266.64 B: prob- 

266.68 268.23 B: probably not 

267.88 268.79 A: yeah 

268.83 281.45 A: but anyway talking about education yeah it's obviously ah important to um to try and take classes 'cause i when i just did that intro class i was wasting so much time going and doing everything the long way 

281.45 286.30 A: and it's just so much easier so tomorrow we're taking the intermediate class 

286.13 287.10 B: taking what 

286.34 290.08 A: which is the intermediate which is just like step two 

289.72 290.87 B: oh cool 

290.72 292.49 A: yeah the class and of 

292.55 297.96 A: course these are short classes they're not long classes like you know so they just kind of touch on everything

314.56 316.99 B: um with the excel ah 

317.20 318.19 B: i don't know 

318.21 329.43 B: like they'll send you a form and you have to fill it out over that and all my pay is done through over the internet it it's all you know it's pretty it's pretty cool but if i

342.77 345.91 B: oh you too [laughter] and when my computer's 

344.48 356.94 A: what is wrong with you and i'm like i can't do anything i can't do a thing i can't send anything he's like well surely you can do something i said all i can do is file who wants to file i can't do a thing without my computer i have to have it well 

352.22 353.37 B: [laughter] 

356.21 362.22 B: ah that's me if something happens to my computer i would stay up for days to get it fixed um 

357.24 357.95 A: (( you )) 

362.93 363.97 B: i don't know 

363.24 369.86 A: can have the the excel like in excel i took a couple of excel classes and to me it was kinda hard to master a little bit 

369.85 378.53 A: um you know the program as far as i can do it like sort of those the charts it was kinda intimidating to try to develop the um 

378.62 381.95 A: the excel tables and stuff and get everything just right 

380.09 381.51 B: yep 

382.13 383.11 A: you know 

382.20 390.44 B: i would love to be able to take a class and learn more you know i think i learn a little bit you know as time goes on but i'd love to learn more 

385.64 386.90 A: yeah 

391.50 395.60 A: yeah well you're never too old either um you know to learn because 

395.77 405.54 A: um computers are well and you know in the classes i took too there was a lot of older people in there too it's not young really young people 'cause they're learning that in junior high and high school 

405.82 407.13 A: you know when i was 

405.96 410.31 B: i think it's i think it's cool that they're you know that they teach the kids you know 

410.24 414.43 A: yeah when i was in college you know we were learning um 

414.58 422.69 A: they were just very simple it was like creating a computer program it was like msdos and you worked in msdos you didn't work in um 

418.98 420.10 B: oh wow 

422.87 427.07 A: you know like in any of these programs they didn't have 'cause i went to college back in 

427.35 429.02 A: nineteen eighty 

429.20 430.82 A: ah seven 

430.53 431.70 B: wow 

431.44 437.20 A: yeah so they didn't have they it's not like it was now now they have the internet the superhighway and 

436.33 438.51 B: [laughter] 

437.39 441.44 A: they have all this really cool stuff you know that they didn't have then so 

440.72 454.73 B: yeah i just i you know i don't know where i would be without the internet i think that there's just so much information out there and just that it you know in a matter of minutes you can find anything that you're looking for 

455.01 460.02 B: i think i don't know it has to be a help to the kids you know that are going to school it just 

460.98 464.84 A: i know they have so much more than we had too [laughter] you know

469.28 473.75 B: now all they have to do is just you know type it in and it's right there for them so 

469.39 470.29 A: (( go ahead )) 

473.12 479.94 A: right yeah they have it i think they have it easier than they think they do definitely with the with the computers and all 

479.52 482.58 B: oh i'm sure yeah [laughter] 

481.64 488.99 A: do you um do you get a lot of your jobs at at um on the computer on the internet you do

499.25 500.13 B: uh-huh 

503.08 512.27 A: and you know at first whenever they were having everybody send the reports like on the computer just a few years ago that started i hated doing that 'cause i was like oh it's just a hassle and
