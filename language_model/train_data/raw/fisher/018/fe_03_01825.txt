19.94 20.97 B: um 

21.00 22.96 B: what's your feeling on this 

22.58 32.71 A: well considering i've just changed my children to a school whose emphasis was on technology [laughter] i would say i'm sort of for the technology you know the computers in schools 

27.45 29.73 B: (( ahah [laughter] )) 

31.88 32.95 B: okay 

32.95 38.12 A: and we've got ah right now there is almost one computer per student at this point yeah [noise] 

36.00 48.68 B: [mn] oh really that's very nice that's very nice ah we don't have quite that you know that kind of technology here yet in our school system but i mean they do have computer labs for the kids and pretty much everyone has to have one at home 

49.25 55.88 B: um i have i have a um i think computers are great you know i really think that they're the way the world is going 

56.14 59.15 B: um as far as education i think that they're they're 

59.19 63.17 B: terrific i my issue with them is as a parent 

63.65 65.76 B: is more in the social aspect 

66.24 67.89 B: than on the educational one 

68.19 76.03 B: ah your six year olds i'm sure you haven't dealt with this yet but when you get they get a little older that's their entire social situation 

76.30 80.22 A: oh no i have not had to deal with that yet no i'm not looking forward to that 

79.07 79.71 B: [mn] 

79.72 83.19 B: [mn] well they don't they won't call there is no talking 

83.54 85.89 B: all their talking is done on the computer 

86.83 89.48 B: in groups like they interact on the computer 

89.10 92.18 A: [noise] right chat rooms and stuff 

89.83 91.02 B: (( and )) 

91.46 99.88 B: yeah well not e- even instant messages and things like that and like if i say to my children why don't you see if so and so is home and they'll say okay i'll go and see if they're online 

100.12 101.02 A: [laughter] 

100.67 102.93 B: like they would never think to pick up a telephone 

103.97 110.95 B: they wouldn't [laughter] neither one of them and and everybody that that i know that has children that age feelings the same way 

106.40 107.32 A: (( [laughter] wow )) 

111.55 119.32 B: so as much as i think they're wonderful for um educational purposes and and obviously the internet has ah 

119.39 126.05 B: created a whole vast in- you know situation of knowledge ah and information that was never available 

127.06 133.24 B: ah at one point my children were doing a report one of them was doing a report on koala bears 

132.61 133.52 A: right 

133.27 136.51 B: and they actually accessed a zoo in australia 

136.32 138.03 A: oh that's cool 

137.68 145.61 B: you know they were talking to you know one of the zoo keepers there and the information obviously was tremendous 

141.93 143.13 A: (( right [noise] )) 

145.64 149.88 B: so i mean you can't i don't see how anybody can 

149.23 153.30 A: [noise] [noise] i think with anything with children you have to you know set your limits 

152.74 153.91 B: mhm 

154.40 158.07 B: (( [mn] well yeah at home obviously but [noise] )) 

154.54 155.57 A: (( they can i )) 

157.86 159.53 A: mean like with me 

159.71 163.38 A: i'm i'm an anti video game parent 

162.78 164.22 B: mhm 

163.74 166.53 A: as i'm seeing with the video games even at this age 

166.15 167.56 B: are they boys or girls 

167.37 168.59 A: one of each 

168.01 169.73 B: one of each wow right 

168.78 171.67 A: yeah so i'm i'm watching to see how 

172.10 179.01 A: they would much rather sit [noise] run to the t._v. screen with it whereas they need to be outside playing an 

178.36 179.31 B: mhm 

179.43 181.72 B: well i had that on the computer with my son 

181.72 183.00 A: yeah 

181.79 186.75 B: because he was very much into as much as the video games he was into him on the computer 

186.59 187.74 A: (( right [noise] [noise] )) 

187.17 189.19 B: and he would play over the internet 

189.90 194.60 B: and he would play with people in you know all over the world 

194.55 195.54 A: oh neat 

194.68 202.99 B: he which is interesting in that he learned a lot of things from these people because they do have some interaction as well as gaming 

202.51 203.52 A: right 

203.58 208.12 B: but i didn't feel the amount of time invested in these 

208.14 211.03 A: well i work at a school and i know like with our 

211.41 217.73 A: with the internet access we have some very stringent blocks [noise] of what they can do at school 

215.62 216.56 B: mhm 

217.35 218.25 B: yes 

217.74 224.65 A: so well i like how they have it set up at school and you know i have even looked into putting those blocks on my children's computer as they age 

224.02 225.11 B: mhm 

224.74 228.41 A: to ensure they can't access anything [laughter] 

227.78 237.30 B: [laughter] yeah well [mn] what happened here was when you did that when i did that or years ago and i'm assuming that ah obviously technology just moves at such a pace that's incredible 

237.31 245.53 B: but when i did it with my children when i did put limits on the computers and you had you know parental guidance and controls they couldn't go anywhere 

243.80 244.82 A: (( right [mn] )) 

246.09 249.52 B: because websites have to be rated 

249.68 252.37 B: in order for the parental control to kick in 

249.73 250.51 A: right 

252.88 255.25 B: so half of the websites aren't rated it 

255.38 264.37 B: doesn't mean they're x. rated it just means they're not rated so even if it's a purely educational site if it doesn't have a rating on it they couldn't access it 

264.69 269.45 A: [noise] maybe they have that problem ah it will not allow you into chat rooms though at all 

268.93 270.97 B: right which is fine 

269.51 270.27 A: which 

270.98 273.03 B: because i think those are horrible [noise] 

272.35 282.93 A: yeah i i watch with a friend of mine's son ah he was in there chatting with someone supposedly his age and they were saying things that were far beyond i thought someone they're age would 

281.97 283.55 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

282.97 284.09 A: know about 

284.15 287.55 A: and i started saying well ask him about this this this and this 

287.63 292.81 A: and they knew the answers to it and i said you're not talking to to a fifteen year old [laughter] 

290.29 291.44 B: (( right really )) 

291.76 296.37 B: yeah you have to get you have to be real careful with this i mean i um [lipsmack] 

294.36 295.18 A: yeah 

296.83 307.35 B: i told both of my children you know that um as much as i'm not looking to invade their privacy totally they're not allowed to have email accounts without having access to it 

307.09 308.01 A: right 

307.39 309.30 B: and i periodically check 

309.55 312.66 B: i check what they're sending as well as what they're getting 

309.61 310.92 A: which you should 

312.22 313.27 A: right 

312.88 317.45 B: you know because i can't you know and i've said to them it's my job to keep you safe 

317.10 317.90 A: right 

317.75 323.37 B: and i don't think you can you have the the capability at even fifteen or seventeen 

323.56 330.79 B: to know at this point what's safe or not safe or who is what they you know this is a totally blind situation 

331.06 332.95 B: you have no idea who you're talking to 

333.06 334.30 A: that's it 

333.65 339.73 B: when you are on these you know computers and and people you know they email each other instant message each other all the time 

340.23 344.85 B: and [mn] you know sometimes they'll say oh so and so gave me your name or number 

344.87 348.07 B: and you know i also tell them do not give anything 

348.13 349.30 A: right 

348.68 350.17 B: any information 

350.53 357.40 B: but i mean as far as the schooling is concerned i can't imagine how a school can even exist at this point without the technology 

357.88 358.97 A: they can't 

358.71 365.15 B: i i don't see how how it's possible i mean the advantages i just think so far outweigh 

365.53 368.56 A: now you're probably old enough you remember lost in space 

368.05 370.14 B: yes mhm 

369.01 378.32 A: there was a particular episode that has been brought back to my attention lately where all the kids were sitting in front of video scenes being taught 

378.70 379.78 B: really 

379.41 384.08 A: and i thought you know it's kind of you know funny about that's you know where it's almost going 

382.51 383.57 B: mhm 

383.91 388.42 B: oh yeah and you know a a friend of mine has as [lipsmack] son in college 

388.60 392.49 B: one of his courses was given over the television set to his dorm 

392.86 394.57 B: he didn't even have to get out of bed 

392.88 393.74 A: (( yeah [laughter] [noise] [laughter] )) 

395.29 397.84 B: it was just videoed right to his dorm 

397.87 405.32 B: i mean it's just an amazing world i i personally don't agree with that i think that is a bit far fetched get out of the bed but 

405.48 407.98 B: um i do think that the the 

408.05 415.45 B: ah information and the ability to move throughout the world for these kids is is just incredible 

415.53 422.47 B: i also happen to like i have one in my home obviously we have more than one in my home ah because we have you know those arguments 

422.27 423.33 A: (( [noise] yep )) 

422.59 423.58 B: um 

424.29 425.25 B: and 

425.32 429.34 B: when they do reports or any kind of projects for school 

429.39 441.80 B: you can access just about any library including the library of congress and they can do this on their time whether it's seven at night or eleven at night or six in the morning and there is no such thing as it's closed 

441.86 448.39 A: right and we did that and and just looking for projects something new and interesting hey let's see what we can find 

444.70 445.93 B: mhm 

448.04 449.33 B: right 

448.42 449.81 A: done that already 

449.82 461.59 B: yeah we ah i have found that i don't think that they could have gone through school to the point that they're at a this my son going to be a senior i can't imagine how they could have done it without a computer 

461.41 463.59 A: [noise] no not at this point oh 

461.83 467.14 B: for reports even e- i have to tell you teachers won't even accept anything that is handwritten any more 

467.91 475.52 B: and back up i mean they even want it half the time on disk they don't even print anything they just give the teacher the disk 

471.03 471.91 A: [laughter] 

474.85 476.76 A: wow no where not that [laughter] 

476.04 480.14 B: yeah i mean it's just an amazing thing or they download it in school 

480.58 484.42 B: you know or they research at school and they send it home 

484.66 490.10 B: to my computer at home they email to themselves they can send information it's just unbelievable 

489.63 497.00 A: now do you get a lot of parent par- you know the the p._t._a. does a lot of things over the computer they announce things to us and 

495.11 496.09 B: yeah 

496.53 502.37 B: the communication the communication that it's you know created is just so much easier 

497.06 498.29 A: we don't have 

502.86 507.05 B: except for the fact that unfortunately it doesn't make people interact 

507.10 510.68 B: and that's the only problem that my husband and i have 

510.33 512.19 A: right you're not getting the human interaction 

511.91 515.42 B: yeah you know he says we are raising a generation 

515.49 518.64 B: of non communicative typists 

518.81 521.42 B: they can all type huh- two hundred words a minute 

521.45 527.46 B: i mean my son can type you know unbelievably but he wouldn't you know he wouldn't pick up a phone to have a conversation 

523.88 524.76 A: (( [laughter] [noise] yeah no )) 

528.30 533.08 B: you know he i mean he will but for the most part his conversations are typed 

533.38 537.35 B: they're not you know verbal and and that's a scary thing for us 

537.36 543.92 B: you know we look at that and we say you know there is going to be some repercussions i really believe that somewhere down the line 

544.26 548.13 B: there is going to come out to be repercussions from that part of the the computer 

548.14 551.23 A: (( that's [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] we haven't had that thank goodness haven't that part yet )) 

550.48 551.97 B: well they're young yet 

551.68 553.84 A: [noise] yeah they're they're too young [noise] for 

554.24 555.65 A: that area 

555.07 559.01 B: mhm but i mean if i say go and call so and see if they want to come over 

559.04 561.14 B: they'll go i'll check if they're online 

561.63 569.03 B: never call i mean and i have to say the telephone use the telephone i mean what's wrong with the phone no no i'll go see if they're online 

569.49 581.36 B: and i find that even parents and and i find myself even sometimes it's easier to email someone [mn] in an unwind situation than it's to call up and go through the hi how are you and how'd the family and 

581.19 585.39 B: if i just need to send you something real quick [mn] i can email it to you in ten seconds 

584.84 586.03 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] right [noise] [noise] )) 

586.02 588.51 B: and we don't have to go through a whole conversation 

588.67 594.45 B: so it's um it's interesting from that point of view the ramifications [lipsmack] of it but 

594.88 597.84 B: as far as our schooling goes [noise] i i think that 

597.87 599.89 B: the the future is definitely going to be every
