427.61 429.40 B: yeah i don't think i want kids either 

430.47 437.50 A: well the reason being i don't want kids is because i have i have a i have a sickness i have ah rheumatoid arthritis 

437.09 438.30 B: (( oh )) 

437.79 441.49 A: and um i take a lot of medication 

441.21 442.63 B: mhm 

442.27 446.20 A: and if i were to have a child it would be very very complicated 

445.94 447.22 B: yeah 

446.60 449.83 A: so it's because i would have to stop all my medications 

449.21 450.60 B: mhm 

450.00 451.27 A: i would have to be 

451.63 455.60 A: drug free completely for like six months before i even try 

455.29 456.32 B: right 

455.74 457.72 A: to have a baby and 

456.78 457.88 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

457.77 463.92 A: by the time that happens i won't even be i won't even be in the mood to have sex [laughter] 

462.69 463.94 B: (( oh )) 

464.11 466.55 A: because yo- i would be in so much pain 

467.48 479.52 A: so forget about that that notion and um my boyfriend i told him i said he i he wants kids but he knows that um you know really it's not my body won't be able to handle it 

479.85 482.63 A: so he's pretty understanding but 

482.72 489.24 A: still usually men want children no matter what you know most most most men want children so 

485.61 486.59 B: really 

488.66 489.82 B: (( oh )) 

489.71 499.92 A: and i tell them all i says if you you know really want a child then i suggest you find somebody else and they say no no no no 

500.11 502.21 B: well what about adopting 

500.75 501.41 A: (( no )) 

503.30 506.08 A: i'm i'm open to it but he's not 

505.87 507.86 B: (( oh mm )) 

507.83 519.22 A: he's the type of person he has deep family values and you know he's like well you have to be married and you have to you know i want a kid of my my own i'm like okay 

517.61 519.07 B: mhm 

519.50 526.17 B: but you know there's so many people in the world having kids you know i mean there are a lot of people that don't have parents 

525.87 527.14 A: mhm 

526.53 527.76 B: (( um [mn] )) 

528.19 530.31 B: i don't know if i ever if i ever 

530.72 533.20 B: was in a place where i 

533.98 537.42 B: wanted to have children i i would probably adopt i think mhm 

536.80 544.67 A: yeah [cough] yeah th- i i i'm definitely would be open to it because there's a lot of children out there who don't have any parents 

544.07 545.47 B: yeah 

544.95 550.42 A: who don't want them you know and there's a lot of wanting kids out there with all with all so many things going on today
