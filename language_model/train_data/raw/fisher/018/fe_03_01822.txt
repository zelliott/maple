24.76 25.70 B: right 

26.17 27.76 B: yeah pretty much 

27.79 29.67 A: you wanna start [laughter] this thing 

29.25 36.77 B: [laughter] sure um well i was just talking ah to somebody else in ah the florida and we had the same

57.94 58.72 A: (( [noise] )) 

59.31 60.10 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

59.47 60.49 B: um 

61.10 68.37 B: yeah mine are ten eight and then i've got one straggler but not that far she's just turning two [laughter] 

66.00 66.88 A: yeah 

67.41 68.70 A: [laughter] 

68.89 75.83 B: um well that's what the other ah lady was saying her first grader has a computer lab 

75.76 76.80 A: (( [mn] ahah [noise] )) 

76.37 83.03 B: at school and that's really funny because i didn't take it i don't even think they had it at high school 

83.09 85.01 B: had it after high school 

84.41 85.33 A: (( ahah )) 

85.74 87.25 B: (( and ah )) 

87.75 101.41 B: i i think most of it is probably pretty good i r- really wouldn't want my kids sitting for hours and hours and hours unless that is their thing they're going to be into and working with but i guess it isn't really hurting anything but 

98.45 99.46 A: yeah 

100.70 102.91 A: i agree um [mn] 

103.02 104.04 A: you know 

104.26 108.47 A: [mn] the question's not very specific um i think they're [mn] 

107.50 108.42 B: no 

108.80 116.65 A: like t- to me what age are we talking about how much time is spent on it and i agree about if you're gonna 

113.17 114.25 B: right 

116.68 126.25 A: [mn] you know something that's that's work related is definitely gonna be helpful when especially when they're in junior high or high school where um 

126.33 134.34 A: old enough to get more ah into it in in more depth [mn] maybe learn some basic programming and um 

134.45 138.61 A: that sort of thing if they want to maybe it could be an elective type thing and 

138.36 140.50 B: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

138.64 140.94 A: ah get a little head start on 

141.18 144.15 A: on college that way and ah 

144.61 148.83 A: and we're in also a head start on you know job skills [mn] [mn] 

146.79 148.50 B: [mn] yeah because 

148.98 151.20 B: definitely not against ah 

151.54 164.33 B: computers i spend a lot of time on them myself [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] exactly exactly mhm so it's like do i i can't say they're too bad [mn] my biggest thing is a lot of the educational software 

153.96 157.59 A: oh me too that's how i found out about this study mhm 

164.39 166.66 B: isn't that educational 

166.70 170.68 B: it is but it m- my main complaint 

166.91 167.97 A: right 

168.57 169.13 A: (( [noise] )) 

171.03 173.07 B: i would say that it's kinda 

173.25 181.94 B: i don't know it's kinda slow like the amount you know they could play it for an hour and i'm not sure they got an hour of learning or anything out of it 

178.56 179.16 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

181.23 187.43 A: [noise] yes i know what you mean i i haven't had much experience with that yet but i've read a lot of other parents' comments on 

186.87 188.11 B: (( [noise] ahah )) 

187.89 192.79 A: things that they've gotten for their children particularly [noise] young [noise] children [noise] and i i've heard similar 

190.96 192.17 B: yeah 

193.01 200.82 A: complaints [noise] that it's just not it's not really time well spent and also that the kids get bored with it so quickly and um 

200.33 214.91 B: um ri- yeah i mean if you have a real little one i really i can't see they need to be on there for you know hours a day like the older they get i think that probably makes more sense providing they're doing something good [laughter] um 

210.68 211.68 A: yeah 

213.48 214.52 A: (( [laughter] )) 

215.52 216.36 A: (( oh [mn] )) 

215.61 223.04 B: that's what i said i do have this one software game called the quarter mile math and i really like it it's um 

220.44 221.78 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

223.11 226.12 B: it's all about speed we home school too 

225.99 227.42 A: (( oh you do )) 

227.13 228.05 B: (( yeah a )) 

227.63 230.19 A: i have a good friend who does that and [noise] 

229.29 239.81 B: a lot of people the other lady her neighbor does that i said it's so funny now i think twenty years ago it would've been really weird and now when you mention it it's like oh yeah i know somebody who does that [laughter] 

239.20 246.89 A: right well [mn] it probably is still considered pretty weird by a lot of people but those people are ignorant you know [laughter] [laughter] yeah 

244.65 256.05 B: well [mn] not as weird [laughter] but they at least know somebody before they wouldn't have even it would've been not just weird but they would've never even hardly heard of it now at least they 

247.53 248.60 A: (( [laughter] yeah [mn] )) 

256.43 259.46 B: are familiar with it it's not that strange [laughter] [noise] 

257.44 258.84 A: yeah i really 

258.93 265.11 A: i have great admiration for for people that do it too so [laughter] um 

262.59 264.28 B: [laughter] 

264.37 265.40 B: um 

265.56 267.35 A: so you get a chance 

265.92 268.28 B: um yeah the quarter mile is great 

267.86 269.61 A: yeah you get a chance [noise] 

269.85 273.38 A: to you're probably kinda familiar with a lot of those things since y- 

273.50 276.62 A: you [noise] you use it for education [noise] [noise] [noise] 

275.92 288.39 B: right yeah um you know i get catalogues and go over tons of stuff [laughter] and that type some are geared towards home schooling and some are just general education products that are open 

279.60 281.35 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

288.30 292.75 B: for a teacher any kind of teachers or anybody for that matter 

292.28 293.66 A: (( [noise] mm oh i )) 

293.99 298.20 A: was just thinking of specific things that that computers could be you 

298.24 304.07 A: know there are some things that are that are more efficient on the computer and some [noise] things it [noise] doesn't matter so [noise] much 

304.14 308.56 A: but um [noise] it seems like like letting the kids have access to things like 

308.65 309.60 A: (( ah )) 

310.63 312.40 A: (( online [lipsmack] ah )) 

312.73 318.88 A: reference books melissa get down from there now ah encyclopedias things like that 

314.37 316.83 B: (( [noise] right well that i )) 

317.43 320.28 B: i would like to get a second one to hook up 

319.96 320.97 A: mhm 

320.87 324.45 B: um that could be more monitored 

323.77 325.69 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

325.35 336.79 B: for the kids um yeah like yeah there is so many great things like you can find any kind of reference materials are on the internet there's lots of good stuff of course there's lots of garbage too [noise] 

335.46 349.63 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yes well [mn] one thing i really appreciate about the internet i mean i can hardly see how i did without it [noise] and i'm forty four you know th- they didn't have they didn't teach computer stuff when i was in school cause seventy seven was my graduation year 

349.65 350.76 A: (( but i )) 

350.97 356.12 B: yeah i graduated in eighty seven and i didn't really have anything either so [laughter] 

351.51 353.25 A: (( love [noise] [noise] )) 

354.30 354.91 A: [noise] 

354.99 356.79 A: yeah [noise] um 

356.69 367.51 A: you can [noise] things so instantly and [noise] sometimes [noise] you know [mn] you know [mn] i guess [noise] it has kinda made [noise] me lazier too [noise] [noise] because instead of looking up a word [noise] and you're physically walking over to my 

363.26 365.58 B: [laughter] [noise] 

367.41 380.57 A: [noise] book you know dictionary [laughter] [noise] i'll just go to the [noise] miriam webster si- site or something and [laughter] look it up you know [noise] [laughter] and um [noise] 

370.16 371.84 B: right 

375.28 380.56 B: dictionary dot com i know [laughter] yeah [noise] [noise] 

380.78 385.52 A: well i guess that's kinda getting off course but ah this probably is too but 

385.49 398.86 A: any time i hear about like kinda alternative things being done in school one thing always comes to mind is that's fine as long as the other more basic things are really being taught cause i i really have a concern that the 

398.92 410.40 A: kids that are coming out of schools now are just less educated i mean i think the really the m- best educated people are the ones you know who are now in their seventies you know that who grew 

408.94 410.20 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

410.46 414.82 A: up my mother back then she said they even had to take latin [noise] which 

415.08 424.42 A: you know a lot of people think that's useless but my mother's very very good with the english language and she said that when you learn latin that so much of english comes from that you 

415.53 416.63 B: right 

424.54 432.75 A: [mn] it helps you ah understand what you see are suffix or prefix and you now what it means because you've studied latin and um 

432.84 437.65 A: i'm not saying kids should go back to studying latin but [noise] my my point's more 

438.10 439.17 A: ah 

439.31 448.63 A: [noise] learning computer is fine you know use computers in ways that are that make [mn] make it more efficient but you know just to be using computers just because it's 

444.50 446.49 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

448.97 451.47 A: you know [mn] just for the heck of it you know 

449.78 454.99 B: [noise] that makes it good yeah ah i agree that um 

455.35 456.86 A: i mean teach them 

456.62 457.57 B: (( [noise] )) 

457.32 460.74 A: teach them how to spell and how to write a sentence you know 

459.43 469.10 B: yeh [laughter] right spell check is great but you better have some idea what you're doing on your own [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] [noise] 

460.92 462.55 A: (( [mn] )) 

464.46 465.56 A: (( yeah )) 

465.91 467.28 A: that's right 

467.29 470.85 A: that's right that that comes in useful and and ah 

471.10 475.19 A: i guess i can't criticize much about math because that was never my strong suit but 

475.22 476.90 A: um um well 

477.02 480.83 A: well one thing i i do like about kids using computers is because when 

477.90 479.62 B: mine neither [noise] 

480.97 481.89 A: the 

481.97 489.59 A: the emphasis on things like emailing and you know at least that's written communication [laughter] rather than being always being on the phone 

487.81 488.74 B: (( yeah )) 

490.12 491.16 B: um 

491.79 494.98 A: ah [noise] anything that helps people write more you know [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

492.13 493.60 B: yeah i don't have 

495.30 496.42 B: um 

496.63 501.34 B: yep there's lots of great opportunities that would just never be there 

501.54 506.70 B: [noise] the instant is just amazing what you can you know if your kid has a question 

504.40 505.56 A: yeah 

507.10 511.36 B: what is that let's go find out [laughter] and 

508.22 509.60 A: (( do it right away )) 

509.78 512.95 A: exactly it used to be when i was growing up my mom would 

513.09 521.66 A: you know either have to i don't know and i don't have time to check or you know or we'd have to go to the library [noise] and that's what i ca- it's just amazing to me how 

516.24 517.73 B: (( yeah right [mn] )) 

521.68 527.40 A: you don't have to go to the library constantly any more [noise] to to research things or to um 

528.02 532.54 B: [noise] right you have a whole massive library in your computer 

528.36 529.83 A: (( i mean [noise] )) 

531.29 534.37 A: right [noise] and it's then a question 

532.98 536.37 B: [noise] i still love the library but [laughter] 

535.49 548.12 A: oh me too but [noise] then guess the question is and this is okay this would be a good thing for them [noise] to teach kids i think [noise] would be how to judge the ah source um [noise] you know you're doing research 

536.68 538.13 B: [laughter] 

547.04 548.51 B: oh that's a good point 

548.88 557.69 A: yeah because anybody can write anything on the internet so like teach the kids the critical thinking well critical thinking they should teach it anyway you know to 

552.63 555.55 B: yes that's true yep [noise] 

557.71 558.70 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

558.71 563.48 A: so that when you read something y- you can kinda judge how um 

563.54 577.19 A: how valid it is you know partly based on maybe whose putting it out and what they're credentials are and like in other words teach them just not to take anything you read as gospel which the same with reading newspapers or anything and 

573.21 577.70 B: [mn] right how can you judge this the right way yeah um 

577.43 584.69 A: that's one thing i think schools are not very good at and that's one i think with home schoolers can teach their kids more to to 

584.80 589.55 A: to think thems- you know instead of of just getting information that critical thinking 

586.82 589.25 B: [noise] yeah they have tons of ah 

590.35 599.90 B: they have tons of programs you can do for thinking that's pretty popular with the home schooling thing um i i just bought some at a convention as a matter of fact i was looking at 

590.40 591.28 A: (( [cough] [noise] )) 

594.85 596.10 A: (( mhm [noise] ))
