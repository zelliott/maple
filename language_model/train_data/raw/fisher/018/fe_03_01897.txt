256.48 269.37 B: [laughter] well i consider i consider my sister my best friend i have only one sister and and we've never lived in the same town since we've been adults she lives in washington and yet ah we ta- 

268.48 270.09 A: state or d. c. 

269.71 279.85 B: washington d. c. and ah we probably talk on the phone three or four times a week and ah now of course with email we email each other too but if ah 

270.83 271.94 A: uh-huh 

279.89 291.23 B: i yeah so far as ah she's probably the one person the person i depend on the most ah besides my husband but you know but i mean in terms of a blood relative um you know 

290.81 292.81 A: is she younger or older than you 

291.97 300.07 B: she's older she's three years older than i am and um you know like i said that she's she's very very important to me and um 

294.17 295.40 A: uh-huh 

300.17 301.00 B: (( you know )) 

301.15 305.55 B: as are as are my children yeah yeah they're they're 

301.26 301.93 A: (( she )) 

305.65 311.60 B: really an important part but i also think that you know the extended family of ah 

311.85 313.70 B: cousins and ah 

314.22 322.29 B: aunts and uncles and all of them have been very important even though we haven't had a a a lot ah we neither of us 

322.22 329.45 B: neither of my parents were from big families but um you know that- are you ital- are you a hundred are you italian on both sides of your family 

324.44 326.03 A: mhm 

328.83 337.08 A: no my father screwed up the bloodline [laughter] um my mother is um partially dutch and irish 

330.55 332.72 B: [laughter] 

336.57 338.69 B: (( ah ah how how good )) 

338.20 339.59 A: (( you know but um )) 

339.72 344.20 A: it it it can be a very volatile mixture [laughter] yeah 

342.89 348.41 B: yeah yeah well i think i think ethnicity in family is always interesting because i thought yeah my 

348.28 352.67 B: my mother was ukrainian and my father was a german and i know that you 

352.43 363.47 B: know my mother was the first person in her family all the other ah her sister married a a ukrainian and you know that that whole idea of if you marry the same ethnic group and i know yeah you know that 

361.66 368.23 A: yeah well we are the melting pot i think that's went out that went out the window a long time ago [laughter] 

366.49 368.59 B: right right yeah 

368.65 382.92 B: certainly certainly the kids you know and then they have you know my husband's from several different ethnic groups so then yeah yeah what happens when you ah you know what does it mean but yeah the whole old idea of what family was when um 

383.23 391.63 B: when there was a single ethnic group was is kind of interesting and that whole kind of mixture of ah customs and traditions that you find when you have 

390.95 393.06 A: does all your children still live with you 

392.91 407.56 B: ah my thirty year old is actually on the west coast so he's uh he's on his own ah i'm wait- waiting for his grandchildren there but i think it's gonna be a while he's not married and ah doesn't show any signs of getting married married for a while so i 

395.92 397.02 A: uh-huh 

401.90 403.88 A: [laughter] 

407.55 408.89 B: (( uh yeah you know )) 

408.95 422.30 B: always always would have loved to have had a daughter and so i figure i have to wait for a granddaughter now [laughter] [mn] but um yeah but then the other one the other two are here here at home and yeah um 

413.01 416.32 A: oh the granddaughter pressure i hate that 

422.27 429.43 B: one is at junior high school ah starting to think about college and and going off and all of those things but ah 

429.57 438.51 B: like i said so so i think that that that whole issue what do you think about the whole idea that that ah of family in terms of ah 

438.93 444.79 B: oh how how would i guess that that whole idea that you choose people who ah 

444.67 455.06 B: choose their family you know say well well the family that i was born into as opposed to my friends who become family do you think friends can ever become as close as family 

454.46 459.24 A: oh definitely most most most ah definitely there's no doubt about that um 

459.69 464.20 A: in the family in the italian family kind of state of thinking um 

464.34 470.18 A: i i hate to put it like this but it's just a basic generalization that water is thicker than blood 

469.59 470.76 B: mhm 

470.21 478.23 A: um the fact is that very easily to accept someone as ah a family member from an outs- outside family of course 

478.27 482.14 A: and ah actually just treat them better or if not 

482.33 484.82 A: um as your own um 

483.74 484.68 B: right 

485.05 489.38 A: personally i i i take people for their face value 

488.96 490.17 B: yeah 

489.58 496.51 A: um as long as there's not any kinda ulterior motive involved then ah take them for what they're worth um 

493.36 494.14 B: right 

496.74 508.30 A: like like i explained my you know my father growing up in the in the depression um they they shared the house and the a guy basically a stranger i consider him my uncle to this day 

503.24 504.26 B: yeah 

507.98 509.52 B: ah yeah yeah 

508.96 513.57 A: and ah oh my god he had ah nine ten eleven kids 

513.03 514.15 B: oh my god 

513.97 516.53 A: so all them are you know 

516.79 524.00 A: [laughter] i i have a problem when it what the official label is of someone who's your uncle 

523.57 524.88 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

523.96 531.88 A: and their offspring have offspring so one separated or whatever that is oh my god it's up there in the hundreds 

525.77 527.44 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

528.49 530.44 B: yeah yeah keeps going 

531.25 533.21 B: oh i bet i bet 

532.26 540.61 A: you know and maybe if i if i hear from them maybe once or twice a year i'm lucky but it's always a good sign i mean like with especially with email we keep in touch 

536.21 537.37 B: [mn] yeah 

540.16 541.59 B: right right 

541.01 542.02 A: (( you know )) 

541.64 546.23 B: well it it's kind of i think it's interesting in terms of of especially 

546.29 554.40 B: the closest part of your family i was just thinking when you were talking about it about being you know sometimes i think we're at our best and we're at our worst with our family you know you kind of 

554.51 562.18 B: those are the times where ah you know you say things to your family that you probably wouldn't say to other to other people [laughter] you know you 

561.10 574.04 A: well i i say things that i wouldn't to other people that i wouldn't tell my family [laughter] you know um personally it's just i i wear my emotions on my sleeve and i don't hold nothing back 

565.49 568.85 B: right [laughter] 

571.86 572.94 B: yeah 

573.55 574.72 B: (( ah ah )) 

574.23 577.73 A: and sometimes i can be a godsend or i could be hell 

577.56 579.69 B: i i bet yeah 

577.86 578.80 A: (( you know )) 

579.08 583.74 A: like it could be could be the best of both worlds or it could be the worst of all 

583.22 585.20 B: [laughter] 

584.04 587.92 A: you know and that's it's that's absolutely insane um [lipsmack] 

587.22 588.92 B: [laughter] 

588.80 594.25 A: [laughter] it's very very hard to explain in ten minutes that's for sure 

590.16 591.08 B: (( ah )) 

593.05 596.22 B: oh it is it is i think yeah and i 

594.59 595.52 A: (( you know ))
