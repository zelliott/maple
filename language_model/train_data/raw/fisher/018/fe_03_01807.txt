0.05 1.12 B: leah 

1.45 3.99 A: hello this is patty hi leah 

3.73 5.04 B: hi [laughter] 

6.40 7.49 B: um 

7.73 9.50 A: have you done this before 

7.81 11.35 B: (( i guess we just talk about i haven't done this before so )) 

11.83 12.82 B: have you 

12.45 16.15 A: i did it once before so i must be an expert by now 

15.51 19.59 B: okay i'll tell you what you take the lead then [laughter] 

17.13 19.02 A: [laughter] 

19.54 29.22 A: well i'm actually very interested in computers in education and think that they can provide substantial leverage 

29.34 39.27 A: um that's sort of um my take on it like tec- books are a technology and people complained that they would take stuff away from 

39.48 41.33 A: the teacher or 

41.51 47.90 A: um voice but computers are just another way of making technology more accessible 

42.93 43.72 B: uh-huh 

48.65 62.27 B: uh-huh um yeah i agree i think i'm amazed at how much my i have a second grader um how much he already knows and you know that he's had computers in the classroom ever since kindergarten 

62.25 65.69 B: and used them um several times a week 

65.38 66.49 A: mhm 

65.90 72.51 B: um maybe not every day but several times a week so ah i i definitely think they can enhance 

72.52 73.49 B: um 

73.85 76.61 B: the education that children get and 

77.03 79.09 B: actually i would like to see you know 

80.19 84.56 B: possibly some of the public school system um 

85.35 90.99 B: maybe using them a little more so that so that the children in those areas can 

91.69 95.09 B: you know somewhat be on the same same level as 

94.19 96.78 A: mhm so your kids are in private school 

96.64 98.08 B: (( no no )) 

97.29 98.06 A: no 

98.23 101.12 B: he's in a public school um 

99.64 100.72 A: mhm 

101.47 116.00 B: but i have you know visited some other private schools for various reasons and you know i'm surprised that [laughter] they're even on a different level and i think that you know some of the children need to play catch up um 

106.57 107.54 A: mhm 

111.39 112.43 A: mhm 

115.20 116.65 A: mhm 

115.97 119.91 B: when they get into the real world as far as computers are concerned so 

120.16 122.16 A: so does he teach you stuff 

122.73 123.85 B: does he what 

123.54 127.66 A: do you still feel like you're ahead of him in computers or has he um 

127.09 132.71 B: oh yeah i still feel like i am um we kind of limit the computer use at home for him 

132.37 133.34 A: mhm 

132.76 133.85 B: um 

134.32 141.09 B: but for for quality you know c._d. for you know educational c._d.s or things like that i'm not saying like 

141.05 150.58 B: internet [laughter] you know i don't think they should be surfing the internet at school but i think a lot of the c._d.s help them and i just think that the children now are 

142.32 143.20 A: mhm 

151.50 158.38 B: they need things so fast anyway because of t._v. and the video games and all that they play with i think 

153.46 155.00 A: mhm mhm 

158.83 166.73 B: i think the some of the old style education doesn't work with them anymore so i think a computer's sometimes the only way to get through [laughter] 

162.93 164.11 A: mhm 

165.88 166.85 A: mhm 

168.37 174.59 A: i i think one of the problems is that a lot of the people that are attracted to teaching 

174.72 180.88 A: especially at the low pay scale offered by our grade schools are people who are 

178.90 179.93 B: mhm 

181.25 190.24 A: high touch kind of people who are a little bit insecure themselves the teachers with um the technology because 

189.46 190.35 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

190.66 200.29 A: they went into teaching because they wanted to deal with human beings not because they wanted to deal with machines they could get a lot more money if they went [laughter] into something dealing with 

199.51 200.65 B: that's true 

200.75 202.35 A: somewhere else 

201.98 203.21 B: that's true ah 

203.53 207.77 B: i never really thought of it like that either [laughter] um 

208.86 211.20 B: but yeah that that is true 

211.31 212.32 B: um 

212.94 216.67 B: and i can only relate to that because i'm thinking of being a teacher myself 

216.20 217.39 A: mhm 

216.79 224.14 B: so um and one of my reasons was well i like to you know get from behind the desk and talk to people more and 

224.28 229.77 B: interact with with other people more so i definitely agree with that point 

225.55 226.72 A: mhm 

227.15 228.09 A: mhm 

229.20 230.33 A: mhm 

230.44 238.88 A: yeah i think that computers are not ever going to replace what a human being can do [laughter] with another human being but they can 

236.36 237.18 B: right 

239.42 244.03 A: hopefully take away the stuff that humans are less good at 

244.38 245.30 B: right 

244.39 257.76 A: and leverage them more so that they can give more focused to individual contact you know so kids you know there's a lot of things that kids need to learn that is sort of drill like and if you can put it on a computer so 

257.71 266.31 A: the drills are coming along faster and more tuned to what that kid really needs to study then the teacher can focus more on being the human being 

262.88 263.63 B: uh-huh 

266.32 267.50 B: right 

267.59 269.27 B: right exactly 

270.53 271.54 B: um 

273.29 276.19 B: gee [laughter] ah 

274.06 280.24 A: [laughter] so how are you going to go about becoming a teacher is this just something that occurred to you recently 

280.09 281.15 B: um 

281.44 283.62 B: pretty yeah actually 

283.65 291.13 B: i've been thinking of it off and on and i've actually gone back and forth between being teacher and being a nurse but 

290.79 291.91 A: mhm 

291.32 297.50 B: the teaching ah road is gonna be a little easier because i already have my degree in english 

297.14 298.30 A: mhm 

297.69 300.43 B: and i'm an editor right now so 

299.65 300.68 A: mhm 

300.95 305.90 B: it's just a matter of going back and getting the teacher teaching certificate um 

306.34 316.84 B: and i i basically just thought of it because my son's on spring break right now and i thought gee if i was a teacher i'd be you know home with him [laughter] but um 

312.04 314.84 A: on spring break too [laughter] 

317.12 318.33 B: (( i've been )) 

318.74 327.73 B: i've been here in the office um doing this for ten years so i'm just ready for you know like i said to be out 

325.86 326.89 A: mhm 

327.35 328.43 A: mhm 

329.01 333.26 B: with the and i don't necessarily know if i'd want to um be with 

333.44 338.71 B: you know younger children or adults or um 

339.53 353.37 B: you know or you know or what kind not necessarily an english teacher maybe a english as a second language teacher or a foreign language teacher so i got a lot to think about [laughter] i got a lot to think about 

340.41 341.27 A: mhm 

345.96 346.98 A: mhm 

347.51 348.81 A: mhm 

349.53 353.02 A: [laughter] that's true 

353.44 354.32 A: there's 

354.15 359.41 A: a program called teach for america that um allows you to teach 

359.22 369.38 A: a lot quicker than i think you start teaching um or being a teacher aide while you're taking classes and it's supposed to be a quick route to 

366.93 367.91 B: oh 

369.33 374.98 A: they they place you i think in schools that are have trouble finding teachers the disadvantaged schools 

374.37 375.55 B: (( really really )) 

374.97 376.02 A: and that can be 

375.90 377.61 A: both rewarding and stressful 

377.59 380.38 A: because those schools are pretty stressed but 

377.69 378.63 B: right 

379.60 380.56 B: yeah 

380.37 393.45 A: the kids i'm doing volunteer work now at a a school that's pretty stressed out so i've seen some of the teach for america teachers and they're they come in with a lot of enthusiasm and the kids really need it because the kids are 

393.40 400.20 A: you know just as smart as the regular basic kids but they have so much more socially and economically working against them 

398.66 399.66 B: right 

399.95 401.00 B: right 

400.23 411.33 A: and then the school is so stressed because it has such little resources compared to other places that the teachers get burnt out fighting up stream and then eventually tend to move to 

405.97 406.94 B: mhm 

412.24 418.03 A: school systems where their lives are not so stressful but it's too bad for the kids 

415.27 416.31 B: right 

417.56 420.74 B: (( right oh well that's a good program thank you for telling me about that )) 

421.05 424.63 B: i i did a volunteer teaching um 

424.67 430.65 B: teaching adults actually for computers [laughter] for adults that had never been um 

427.15 428.31 A: (( mhm )) 

430.88 441.59 B: never logged on to a computer and we got them set up with a free hotmail account and told them showed them how to surf the internet um it was like a five week course 

432.98 434.11 A: mhm 

441.03 441.87 A: mhm 

442.20 444.62 B: um for like an hour and a half 

444.16 445.37 A: mhm 

444.77 445.94 B: um 

446.59 460.59 B: and i re- i i enjoyed that you know and i did i did volunteer for it just because i i wanted to kinda see you know how i would like it and um although i know it's a lot different those people wanted to be there they [laughter] the kids don't always want to be in the classroom 

448.52 449.58 A: mhm 

457.97 460.22 A: mhm right right 

460.67 469.00 B: but um i enjoyed it and so i'd like to explore it a little more so thanks a lot [laughter] um 

463.63 464.46 A: mhm 

467.14 467.89 A: (( [laughter] )) 

469.49 473.29 B: i don't know what to too much i could say about the um 

474.66 475.76 B: um 

476.94 479.17 B: i you know again negatively 

481.22 484.99 B: [sigh] i i would you know like you said i would hate to see 

485.73 490.90 B: i mean and i don't think they ever would replace it but you see more and more you know automation 

490.62 491.63 A: mhm 

491.09 492.17 B: um 

492.63 494.13 B: with everything 

494.17 495.24 A: mhm 

494.44 497.63 B: and so i wouldn't be surprised at you know 

497.86 503.83 B: some kind of automated you know if they had to do test taking on the in the computer in the classrooms or 

502.63 503.66 A: mhm 

503.90 504.98 B: um 

505.70 508.15 B: or anything like that 

506.85 512.60 A: mhm the drills and the test taking i think are good ways of using the technology because 

511.81 512.55 B: (( yes )) 

513.20 522.15 A: that is stuff that teachers probably don't like so much anyway [laughter] and it's hard to be as individualized about it as you can be with a computer 

516.70 518.87 B: right right right 

522.18 523.48 B: exactly 

523.92 525.80 B: so um 

526.12 529.57 B: and you know when i when i was teaching the teaching the adults 

529.60 530.43 B: um 

531.00 544.39 B: i kept trying to think back to when i was in school and i can't even remember the internet when [laughter] i just graduated in the early nineties and i can't remember if we had the internet in the school or not and um 

536.22 537.93 A: [laughter] yeah 

544.66 553.67 B: you know now that's it was like on every every computer in the because we actually taught in a middle a middle school um they let us use their space 

551.16 552.14 A: mhm 

553.72 561.77 B: so um we were using school actual school computers and you know it was on every desk top and and um 

561.94 570.39 B: i just wondered like how how much of the the classroom time are these [laughter] kids surfing the net you know and what kind of blocks do they have there 

567.83 569.31 A: [laughter] 

570.53 575.80 B: um but a lot of the kids like i said again it's a public school may not have 

576.12 585.70 B: access at home may not have a computer at home so um and again i think they're gonna they need to learn about it and they need to 

576.29 578.63 A: mhm mhm mhm 

579.06 580.03 A: mhm 

584.13 585.18 A: mhm 

585.72 595.24 B: you know before they get into the real world and and you know people are talking about this and that and they don't have a clue because um there's a gap there so 

590.05 591.77 A: mhm mhm 

596.66 597.65 B: um 

598.96 599.89 B: (( i don't know )) 

599.19 599.89 A: well have you
