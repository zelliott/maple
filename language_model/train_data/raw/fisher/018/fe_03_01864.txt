199.95 200.63 A: (( [laughter] )) 

200.22 207.64 B: you know and because they got you know into it at an early age and they had more access to more information at an early age 

201.23 202.39 A: (( yeah )) 

207.65 208.68 A: yeah 

207.94 213.30 B: you know it's like so they could build you know these systems and do this stuff by the time they were ten 

213.54 220.76 B: you know it's it's like this the common knowledge of of humans you know progressing through these machines 

221.46 222.41 B: you know 

222.37 224.69 A: yeah it kinda freaks me out though you know what i mean 

225.49 228.38 B: it it does um 

228.63 229.88 B: in the sense of 

229.90 232.95 B: in the sense of like you're losing a lot of stuff too i guess 

232.96 237.80 A: [laughter] yeah i don't know i still really like books do you know what i mean and a lot of people are just like 

233.27 234.27 B: um

263.50 264.54 A: oh killer 

264.89 265.82 B: so 

265.85 266.74 A: yeah 

265.87 267.02 B: the um 

267.32 271.13 B: but yeah that's that's but the dissemination of those things too 

271.17 274.96 A: oh vocab they're looking for that this is a linguistics survey 

271.35 272.33 B: you know 

272.85 273.77 B: (( you know )) 

275.26 276.70 B: oh yeah 

276.83 277.98 B: um 

278.23 280.59 B: the there was no 

281.13 292.18 B: i mean especially like with the internet just in the last few years you know the dissemination of information amongst you know every all classes has become just such a phenomenal thing 

293.01 294.00 B: you know 

293.30 294.77 A: yeah 

294.78 301.24 B: it's like before we really relied on television and now you know we have the computer stuff to really help us 

301.62 306.50 B: you know move information around in a way that's not packaged and controlled by people 

306.88 312.80 A: yeah but it's like it's like in a way it still is because of all the advertising and you know what i mean like 

313.31 318.82 A: [sigh] like if people have internet access through a._o._l. or through m._s._n. then they're going to get like a barrage of 

318.99 319.81 A: (( you know )) 

319.74 328.50 B: the constant advertising and as far as and i've kind of like a love hate thing about that it's like i hate the advertising but i've just kind of turned you know like tuned it out 

320.09 321.28 A: yes 

321.30 322.25 A: (( yeah )) 

328.31 340.35 B: and it helps pay for a lot of that stuff that otherwise you know we wouldn't be able to pay for you know it's expensive enough as it is without like imagine if if there weren't any you know commercials in there or anything 

333.76 334.87 A: yeah 

340.82 347.99 B: you know it would be twice as expensive and the people that are have you know lower income stuff that you know can't afford that regularly 

347.87 351.90 A: which is everyone which is me and which is probably you you know 

348.67 350.36 B: you know which 

351.30 356.79 B: yeah pretty much [laughter] i pay too much for access now it's crazy 

352.96 354.06 A: (( you know what i mean )) 

356.63 359.27 A: yeah like if we're gonna talk about classes i'm like 

359.42 363.76 A: they're basically like the class system in our country's totally messed up and 

363.47 365.95 B: yeah it's yeah it is 

364.91 366.97 A: we're poor i'm poor 

366.20 375.63 B: and how yeah and and how would you know and you know the i just work previously well i got laid off last year but i was working for this conservative think tank 

375.77 384.74 B: and um which was really hard with my politics you know [laughter] i just liked to keep my mouth quiet and like just do my job kinda stuff 

380.55 381.58 A: yeah 

384.96 393.15 B: but they you know a lot of their stuff they're proponents of like getting rid of public school system and doing school vouchers you know or you know 

391.24 395.77 A: well most of the public schools like are owned by pepsi and coca-cola and 

395.73 402.42 B: it's getting that way it seems like yeah you know getting they they were talking about like getting rid of like the public library system and 

396.00 396.94 A: you know 

398.09 398.95 A: yeah 

402.79 411.68 B: i was like okay hello like you remember eighteen fifty when there was no like [laughter] you know the only people who knew how to read were the people who you know 

408.12 408.96 A: yeah 

411.71 414.95 B: like were rich the only people who knew you know 

413.58 417.20 A: yeah you remember like sixteen eleven like the king james bible 

415.75 416.81 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

417.07 423.15 B: yeah exactly yeah just right back to that you know and of course they're all with like silver spoons so 

423.16 424.54 A: yeah they're so 

423.25 429.28 B: you know they don't think about those things you know i grew up you know the poor black child you know 

429.42 432.97 B: [laughter] and had ah i was joking it's a reference to the jerk 

429.65 430.45 A: what 

433.02 436.32 B: you know the steve martin movie [laughter] that's okay 

433.44 434.81 A: oh sorry 

435.61 438.00 A: you grew up as a small black child and it's like 

437.21 440.25 B: i grew up i grew up a poor black child 

440.30 441.47 A: uh-huh 

441.59 442.73 B: um 

441.89 443.44 A: [laughter] 

443.00 452.88 B: the ah i mean i did i grew up you know just really poor like in texas and we were on welfare and you know and stuff so i've seen like the other side of that thing you know 

449.09 449.98 A: (( yeah right )) 

453.23 461.05 B: and just so you know the only reason that i got you know access to a lot of the stuff i got was because of you know social programs 

461.16 467.20 B: you know like i wouldn't be able to do what i do now if it wasn't for those social programs being in place when i was a kid 

461.53 462.41 A: yeah 

467.67 470.15 B: (( most of the things they're trying to get rid of you know )) 

470.38 471.60 A: (( yeah )) 

471.33 479.59 B: so but um again off off topic i guess um [laughter] dissemination of information through computer systems 

471.75 473.25 A: (( that's freaky then )) 

479.97 481.75 B: and computers in education 

481.95 487.21 B: you know i think really just helps it helps that it's like social programs 

487.35 493.74 B: for the self motivated i guess or to help increase self motivation amongst 

493.84 497.60 B: you know kids rather than just you know shoving stuff down their throats 

497.71 499.09 A: yeah you got it 

498.11 499.06 B: (( you know )) 

499.49 500.47 B: so 

500.48 501.97 B: it's a good thing 

502.19 503.51 A: i think it is too 

503.72 505.56 B: yeah really you know 

504.26 507.21 A: but really what do i what do i know about computers or 

507.54 511.06 A: the internet or partying or anything like that anyway right 

510.42 513.87 B: [laughter] i guess just as much as any of us know 

513.53 514.78 A: yeah yeah 

514.09 518.16 B: you know you only have you only have as much information i guess as you're interested in so 

517.97 519.61 A: exactly 

519.01 519.95 B: you know 

520.57 525.29 B: that's ah but even with i believe you know like with your thing too because you're actually in school 

525.48 527.86 B: you know i'm sure you do a lot of research on line 

528.61 539.51 A: oh totally like i mean i'll half the articles i find but you don't have to like order things from the library any more you can find full academic scholarly articles on line 

538.34 539.65 B: right 

539.96 541.10 A: which is sweet 

541.22 549.60 B: right and it's right there since it's you don't have to deal with if somebody else has it check out or you know this is in our archives and you can't take it out the building or 

546.01 547.05 A: (( yeah )) 

549.50 550.58 A: (( yeah )) 

549.80 555.92 B: you know it's it's like lost in their like filing system or any of that kind of stuff 

555.97 561.06 A: but i think the scary thing about that is like the more more junk that's out there the harder the 

561.11 563.21 A: things of actual quality 

563.22 564.18 B: mhm 

563.59 566.82 A: are going to be able to find and like discerning 

566.88 569.95 A: whether it's valid information or not is gonna be 

567.14 568.50 B: right 

569.22 570.40 B: sure 

570.14 571.59 A: more difficult to 

571.95 573.95 B: like proof of 

574.22 578.92 B: of ah sources or proof of like the factuality of the information 

577.97 583.25 A: yeah like what's published because like anything can be published on line do you know what i mean 

583.18 591.27 B: right yeah and i'm always fighting with my like 'cause my mom's always sending me those things like you know gotta support the war kind of crap you know 

584.13 585.08 A: so 

590.55 591.74 A: yeah 

591.48 594.92 B: and you know i'll send it back to her and i'm like yo know mom this is a hoax 

595.01 595.97 A: yeah 

595.10 599.95 B: you know [laughter] it's like look at you know look at this thing or look at this thing over here first
