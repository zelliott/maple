0.27 1.32 B: (( hello )) 

0.81 2.48 A: hi [laughter] 

1.89 3.14 B: hi i'm vila 

3.00 4.00 A: you're phillip 

3.89 4.97 B: (( vila )) 

5.00 7.30 B: it's a nickname hi hi nice to meet you 

5.02 6.56 A: vila hi i'm susan 

7.41 8.23 A: [laughter] 

7.54 9.21 B: um where are you 

9.71 11.20 A: um i live in florida 

10.81 13.63 B: oh okay i'm in washington state [laughter] 

12.89 15.26 A: okay [laughter] well 

15.41 22.30 A: uh education i was a teacher [laughter] so but it it was prior um computer era 

17.03 18.08 B: oh 

22.40 26.21 B: oh i'm a computer guy [laughter] 

24.12 26.91 A: oh well then this might be interesting 

26.58 30.82 B: because i actually work uh on the data that they collect from to study 

30.51 31.67 A: mhm 

31.03 34.10 B: and build speech recognition systems and 

34.44 39.95 B: see how well we do in trans- building machines that transcribe these conversations 

40.28 42.81 A: oh okay that's that's neat 

43.54 44.56 B: (( yeah uh )) 

44.44 45.34 A: (( well i mm )) 

44.69 50.36 B: so when i first heard the topic it's interesting you said you were a teacher because i thought you know 

50.86 56.03 B: computers are probably irrelevant and what's really important is the teachers you know 

56.33 61.09 B: like the one thing that can make education good or bad is good or bad teachers 

61.16 69.45 A: to to a great degree i i agree with you there but um i guess people have to learn how to adjust in the world and the world is computer literate 

67.72 69.04 B: right 

69.21 70.96 B: right 

69.58 80.03 A: um i'm computer semi literate [laughter] i've got one i could do my email and i could you know search on a few things but i know my grandchildren 

73.01 75.20 B: [laughter] 

79.92 81.13 B: mhm 

80.50 81.73 A: all use them 

82.07 85.98 A: but not to the exclusion of um everything else 

85.93 94.90 B: right yeah i i think yeah it's important that you know as i say a kid graduating from high school is able to use a computer 

95.59 103.68 B: so in those terms i think there should be a subject of education like something you learn to use and be proficient in 

103.41 107.16 A: well my kids my grandch- my oldest is thi- thirteen my youngest 

107.38 115.20 A: uh is is like two [laughter] so i mean i mean they they're more even the four and five year old are more proficient in it than i am 

114.96 118.02 B: [laughter] right yeah i mean kids pick it up really quick 

117.64 121.80 A: yeah and they the the thing that i always thought when i went to school 

121.69 122.49 B: (( ahah )) 

121.91 125.47 A: and this and this maybe will have something to do with definitely with the topic 

125.79 128.29 A: i i always felt that the 

128.48 138.27 A: where where education was lacking was not necessarily teaching but in teaching people how to find things because the brain can just hold so much at any one time 

132.80 134.03 B: mhm 

137.22 139.11 B: right 

138.41 140.90 A: so i think the computer is an excellent tool 

140.69 142.34 B: mhm 

141.60 144.73 A: um i never learned how to read newspapers properly 

144.81 146.24 B: right 

144.85 149.62 A: which was of course that was our main way of edu- of um finding you know um 

149.97 151.36 A: of communication 

150.97 152.31 B: mhm 

151.65 152.85 A: (( years ago because i )) 

152.95 163.42 A: i'm little bit older obviously [laughter] and i the t._v. and television just had come you know when i was i was a kid television had just come out it certainly wasn't the um information source that it is now 

158.65 159.46 B: (( [laughter] ahah )) 

164.73 167.34 A: so i definitely think computers need to be 

167.46 169.18 A: in education and taught 

169.62 175.83 A: um you know obviously the personal touch is important but i can't see how anyone is going to make it without it 

175.74 189.02 B: right no i i just you know i think that it's just uh important not that it's important to learn people to use computers as tools i was when i heard the question what first came to mind was like 

189.09 192.15 B: you know using computers to kind of 

192.90 198.21 B: almost replace teachers like instead of you know investing in 

195.70 197.63 A: oh i didn't think of it that way 

198.27 200.33 B: getting better teachers to just 

200.40 209.21 B: you know say okay let's just get a bunch of computer labs and you know that's going somehow magically make kids learn better [laughter] you 

206.64 207.69 A: (( okay [mn] )) 

208.02 214.63 A: i hear you in that respect yes i think you're right i i don't think there is any substitute for a good teacher 

209.74 210.57 B: (( know )) 

214.08 216.80 B: right but definitely they should 

214.76 219.53 A: i i didn't think of that at all i didn't see i heard the question differently 

216.92 217.63 B: (( they )) 

219.25 227.05 B: right i mean i think i mean but i've i've talked to people who seem to think that you know 

227.24 230.18 A: that they don't need the the the um human touch 

229.82 240.11 B: right that you know that it's the end all and be all and that somehow and i think as far as teaching kids to use computers as tools 

231.96 232.72 A: (( mm )) 

239.66 244.06 A: right that's why then i think that i'm i'm more on your side in that respect 

240.95 242.20 B: right 

242.32 243.38 B: right 

243.47 246.32 B: and even that i think 

244.12 250.19 A: i didn't think of it at all as c- as computer being the the sole source of learning not at all 

248.26 256.74 B: right or or you want like a medium of learning like replacing text books with like computer programs and things like that you think so 

252.95 258.57 A: basically that that it it could help there but i think more more up to date stuff 

258.13 259.50 B: right right 

258.69 261.47 A: you know because you you can't keep up with history any more 

261.28 263.54 B: [laughter] right 

261.69 262.96 A: (( through the text book )) 

263.58 274.33 A: but um and [mn] probably use it as good for teaching and stuff like that but i mean as far as maths we used to think when we when the kids took our computers not computers calculators that 

273.30 274.16 B: right 

274.43 276.52 A: in a way it has hurt them 

276.67 285.25 A: because they don't have they may not know how to add they depend on the calculator but long as the calculator will always be around it will help but i still think they have to have an understanding 

276.96 278.00 B: right 

279.59 280.94 B: right 

284.77 286.60 B: right exactly i mean 

286.24 289.31 A: and the only way you can do that is with the personal touch 

288.66 292.95 B: yep yep and the other thing i was thinking was you know if you 

293.36 297.97 B: i think there's uh probably going to be a big difference um as far as 

298.12 308.21 B: um rich kids and poorer kids go because with richer kids they're probably having access to a computer at home and kind of um 

308.23 320.36 B: you know they will pick it up almost by themselves because they have been exposed to it whereas poorer kids who don't have access to a computer at home i think they're the ones with the most to gain from 

310.55 311.31 A: mhm 

320.68 323.98 B: you know computers being taught at school 

322.87 324.33 A: in school mhm 

324.55 326.02 B: (( because [mn] )) 

324.94 330.54 A: right because then they will have the access to it or even at a library and maybe you know stir their interest in it mhm 

326.52 327.98 B: right i mean 

328.88 331.84 B: right and the public library for example i think is a great idea 

332.67 336.46 B: because i mean growing up i was lucky enough to you know my 

336.06 337.25 A: how old are you 

337.00 339.96 B: i'm [laughter] i'm twenty eight 

339.58 344.64 A: yeah okay my my son is thirty eight so it gives you an idea mhm 

340.00 341.19 B: and 

342.73 349.54 B: right so um i i actually grew up to sri lanka which is kind of a developing country but 

349.45 357.79 B: i was lucky that my dad bought a computer when i was in third grade and i got hooked onto it 

357.87 368.88 B: and so even though i didn't have exposure to computers at school like formally i'd play around with it at home and use it for various things 

369.05 377.52 B: and you know we didn't have internet or anything like that but just just even just playing games on the thing really helped me kind of get used to using one 

377.25 389.52 A: right not be afraid of it the first time i ever touched one was when i i i worked started work about nine years ago at i [mn] not being i i stopped being a teacher when i moved down here i raised my children 

378.46 380.17 B: right exactly 

383.86 384.55 B: (( ahah )) 

388.07 389.23 B: right 

389.60 396.60 A: i used to be from new york [laughter] and um i went i got a job in in sales but the you know in a very 

390.92 391.83 B: okay 

394.74 395.67 B: mhm 

397.30 400.55 A: easy computer basically very basic type thing 

400.58 405.44 A: and um once i learned not to be afraid of it that i couldn't you know that it could find things 

405.22 406.17 B: right 

405.58 419.41 A: then i was at ease with it and which helped me become more at ease with the one at home i still can't find when i send something somewhere i often can't find it and i'm surprised when i can i know if someone would just sit down with me i could but um 

407.12 408.46 B: right 

414.70 417.12 B: [laughter] 

418.02 419.29 B: right 

419.52 421.57 A: for what i need it it works 

421.33 422.55 B: right 

421.92 424.26 A: as i said i'll probably get my kids here to help me 

424.23 428.13 B: [laughter] yep yeah 

424.42 426.70 A: (( my grandchildren to help me some day )) 

427.52 437.30 A: but uh no as replacements no i'm i'm completely against that but as an addition to and an important addition to i think that they need to have computers 

431.52 432.67 B: right 

437.90 440.80 B: and like do you how 

441.11 443.81 B: how early and how much do you think 

443.85 455.85 A: how early as much as they are willing to bear i i said i have a [mn] a little um one granddaughter who's well now she's five but when we went to one of the museums hands on museum 

454.37 455.06 B: (( ahah )) 

455.74 456.80 B: yeah 

455.99 459.79 A: and she was able to go they had a computer geared toward that age 

459.51 460.86 B: oh wow 

460.18 464.98 A: and they weren't afraid of it at all i mean and it was just simple things you know it had pictures 

465.29 470.09 A: you know and [mn] if something that matches it you know matching colors matching um 

465.32 467.08 B: right 

470.23 482.10 A: shapes letters uh they they can start very early my my two year old uh granddaughter um she's helped her parents use it so i'm sure she's not going to be afraid of it at three 

471.20 472.05 B: right 

474.01 475.11 B: oh wow 

482.24 483.98 B: right 

483.04 488.81 A: and they do have enough gear well you're in the business you must know they gear computers way down 

488.70 490.74 B: i didn't know that actually 

490.15 493.70 A: oh they do yeah they have programs for li- uh for preschoolers 

493.37 495.84 B: oh [laughter] 

495.35 503.66 A: and it's not scary it's actually fun they actually enjoy it and then by that time they are ready to [mn] have it an information tool they're not afraid of it 

496.81 497.97 B: right 

502.40 503.21 B: (( ahah )) 

503.78 505.73 B: (( right yes )) 

505.13 506.99 A: they learn how to use the mouse 

506.85 508.16 B: (( yeah the what )) 

507.08 509.57 A: it it's much easier type thing 

509.70 513.13 B: the one thing i have seen is uh language learning programs 

513.13 514.21 A: mhm 

513.57 517.40 B: and there i've seen like it seems to really help because 

517.52 526.21 B: um it listens to you pronounce words and tells you when you you know it helps you get the accent down right and 

525.71 528.17 A: oh they they actually i didn't know they had that 

527.58 536.34 B: yeah like the i was playing around with a spanish program and it just makes you repeat and then you know it will play back what you said and how you should have said it 

535.45 540.63 A: see now we both learned something you didn't know there were preschool and i didn't know there was computers that can hear 

536.95 538.58 B: [laughter] 

540.81 545.27 B: oh well yeah the reason i knew about it is because that's exactly what i work in so [mn] 

541.90 544.01 A: well basically you know and 

545.87 551.50 B: so i i was keeping track of things what that it actually gets used to used for 

551.25 552.03 A: oh 

551.76 553.09 B: but um 

553.41 556.68 B: yeah and i thought that was a kind of really neat 

555.77 558.80 A: so it can actually teach you can actually learn a language on the computer 

557.83 567.05 B: yeah you can really learn a language but i still wonder whether so these are designed primarily for people who who are not taking a language class or just sitting at home and trying to learn a language 

567.48 569.76 B: and i still wonder 

570.11 571.31 B: whether 

571.34 575.87 B: you know how well that would integrate into a class where there's a real live teacher 

575.62 583.48 A: right it would be i think that would be a little bit difficult they could learn the basics but the slang words and the expressions and stuff probably wouldn't translate very well 

579.52 581.39 B: right 

581.59 585.38 B: right yeah exactly um 

585.43 591.03 B: i guess you know if i was a teacher and i had thirty students in a spanish class then this would kind of help because 

592.10 595.39 B: you know it's hard to hard to give the kind of attention 

596.62 599.89 B: with that many so i guess it would be kind of like a multiplier 

596.81 597.73 A: right
