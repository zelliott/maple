252.98 266.92 A: we don't have time for different features maybe even sometimes family we don't have time for because we're that busy there is a little bit different family is important in a lot of ways differently than here because they make time a little bit more than what we do unfortunately

574.68 587.47 B: yeah i think it will be a really interesting study i'd be interested to find out the results of what they can conclude about like absolute strangers just talking to each other for like ten minutes and probably be very beneficial 

587.91 596.34 B: i know i learnt stuff like that as a communications major all different studies about the different ways people communicate and different depths and demographics and stuff
