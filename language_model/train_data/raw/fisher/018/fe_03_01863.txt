0.56 2.35 B: hi my name's mark 

1.91 3.71 A: hi mark i'm tanya 

3.52 4.51 B: (( how you doing )) 

4.45 5.86 A: i'm doing pretty good how about you 

5.69 11.78 B: good i i i actually missed what it said how does what have to do with um 

6.57 7.34 A: good 

11.78 13.78 A: education computers do 

14.12 15.23 B: (( oh okay )) 

14.79 17.46 A: they harm or do they enhance education 

17.02 17.95 B: okay 

19.62 20.39 A: (( so )) 

19.69 20.60 B: (( [sigh] )) 

21.58 24.52 A: i don't think we could live without computers at this point in the world 

23.93 26.65 B: yeah yeah definitely i ah 

26.82 30.03 B: i well i guess i could start ah 

30.11 34.69 B: now kids nowadays i mean they see it from early on you know a lot of 

34.75 45.52 B: parents older siblings have it they're already seeing it by the time they a couple of years old and by the time they hit first grade they're probably expecting to see the computer in the classroom so 

44.97 50.33 A: oh yeah and especially you know i don't know what percentage of homes have computers i know it's quite high 

50.59 59.30 A: but yeah they're being they've been exposed to it like you say from a very very early age and you have to have i mean if you don't have computers in the classroom they're gonna be left behind 

58.95 63.40 B: right yeah 'cause i see my nephews you know they're 

63.51 77.21 B: in like fourth grade and and kindergarten and they come over to my parents' house and like you know what can we do on the computer and you know my parents being older are like well not much [laughter] they're like no like you can do everything on the computer so 

77.39 85.21 B: just seeing that as it infiltrates society and and it starts with kids and goes up that you'll be able to do so much more so 

85.25 89.05 A: well yeah the kids are very you know they're not afraid to do anything or try 

89.09 90.83 B: right 

90.56 98.78 A: it yeah but it's interesting what the older set you know they're some are so afraid and others are just like wow this is pretty cool this is like a extension 

99.12 101.85 A: of a communication source to the outside world 

101.64 103.39 B: right 

103.39 105.99 A: (( i don't know most of the old people that i know are )) 

106.02 110.16 A: don't have a com- a problem with the computer then there are others that just won't touch it 

110.62 111.79 B: (( right [noise] )) 

113.11 113.89 A: subject 

117.48 121.10 A: it's the education and computer question is 

121.19 123.38 A: not i guess not there's not too much 

123.46 125.35 A: controversy there right 

124.67 131.06 B: right well yeah i mean you can always find something they say well okay um 

131.22 134.54 B: as far as kids learning to 

134.57 137.84 B: um communicate and that that is a part of education 

137.71 148.22 B: you know learning how to interact with people say well if they're doing everything on line and um they're not meeting people face to face you know how much are they losing but um i guess that's 

148.08 154.21 B: a lesser argument if the computer is used as a tool and not the only ah learning experience 

155.21 170.09 B: so if you have all on line classes you could say well okay maybe people aren't learning to but i think in general if it's used as um an implement to to learn more to be able to get on line and ah research a paper 

170.29 175.86 B: versus that's our only source so i mean i guess you could find a negative about anything really 

175.25 175.97 A: (( yeah ah )) 

177.93 180.66 A: you're right and then how much time do you spend you know 'cause 

180.52 182.53 B: right 

181.58 185.75 A: they spend a lot of time you know surfing the net playing games you 

185.07 186.85 B: right 

186.23 189.56 A: know it's i guess using technology responsibly 

189.46 197.21 B: right that's the same like you mentioned you know what are they using it for if they're learning well it's only good for games then 

197.20 205.54 B: it's not going to be anything different than a sega but they say well you can play games but you know you can find the news um 

205.75 211.89 B: you know you can learn how to do things if it's seen as like an infinite potential resource 

211.95 221.10 B: then they're going to get into a lot more than just something limited well you can only you know use it for chat rooms or you can only play games 

221.16 226.53 B: that the they're just not gonna pick up everything that they can but 

226.63 227.27 A: (( right )) 

226.64 229.67 B: so that's not a case with a lot of people too so 

229.46 233.21 A: i guess from a standpoint of education if the instructor re- en- 

233.23 240.88 A: requires certain things you must use the internet to find your sources and that kind of thing that could be a very positive thing a 

238.01 239.12 B: right 

240.32 241.67 B: right 

241.22 244.17 A: lot of it depends upon the educator 

244.93 246.08 B: exactly 

246.01 258.31 A: i don't have a lot of contact with younger children so i don't know you know what's what they're doing today in the classroom you know you see them working you see them you know shows and that so but what's really happening what kind of learning's really going on 

258.16 259.88 B: right 

259.90 260.90 A: benefit 

261.59 273.55 B: i started getting to that ah in college where it was the point that um there were several classes where the papers had to be submitted on line you had to look up um the homework on line 

273.13 274.26 A: really okay 

273.60 278.43 B: yeah just getting people in the habit of hey you know this is this is here to stay but then 

278.54 284.63 B: you did run into the problems cause by the computer being you know the network was congested and you know 

284.73 288.01 B: something went down there's a problem with the server so 

288.50 296.11 B: it's really not the end all of everything i mean everything has its limitations the more you rely on anything the more you're hurt when it's not there 

295.94 306.63 A: that's right that's right but boy is it nice when you go on vacation and you don't have the computer but it's interesting 'cause i was travelling abroad and checking email while i was gone and it was like 

306.51 312.51 A: i really looked forward to using the time but a short period of time not spending hours and hours 

311.79 313.15 B: right 

312.77 317.25 A: so it was great to have to communicate with people but it was also nice to walk away from it right 

316.93 324.27 B: yeah it's it's easy to ah to get sucked in you you sit down for twenty minutes and you find that you're on for three hours so 

326.16 333.12 A: that's right but but travelling and and technology and it was interesting because where we were it was you know 

333.23 340.74 A: southern hemisphere but it was very imperative to have phones so you kinda went cell phones which in the united states i don't see that very often 

336.41 337.42 B: right 

340.16 341.67 B: right 

341.05 348.62 A: but it was like no big deal and of course people who do travel they can have the third generation phones and they have that chip you can put in 

348.37 349.74 B: right 

348.99 350.62 A: just buy a block of time 

350.96 354.21 A: but um we didn't really quite realise that but 

354.21 354.93 B: (( mm )) 

355.02 360.33 A: it's amazing with technology and how it how it enhances your life i guess 

359.89 361.29 B: right 

361.73 363.39 B: exactly 

363.96 366.86 A: have you done this survey or this study before 

366.49 370.19 B: no this is this is my actually ah first call here 

369.53 372.72 A: okay i did one last night actually and it was i 

372.87 378.43 A: don't even remember what the subject was but it was i hadn't heard of this study before so it was kind of interesting 

378.18 379.74 B: right 

380.71 381.75 B: (( hm )) 

382.90 385.35 B: yeah i actually went to penn so 

385.42 386.44 A: i'm sorry 

386.05 390.87 B: that the school that i think that sponsors the ah study 

390.31 391.31 A: mhm 

391.05 393.82 B: that's how i found this someone was like hey you know 

393.38 394.65 A: penn state 

394.44 396.53 B: university of pennsylvania 

395.95 398.91 A: oh okay okay okay so you're a are you a student there 

397.27 398.23 B: yeah 

399.20 402.23 B: no i i've actually graduated 

401.62 403.49 A: okay what attended school 

403.95 406.16 A: so are you still on the east coast now 

406.19 408.88 B: ah yeah i just moved ah 

409.10 412.30 B: to ohio i was originally born and raised here so 

412.39 416.64 B: i i came back to ohio i've bounced around ah 

416.98 426.04 B: i was in philadelphia and new jersey and almost was in new york and then went off to california and i've kinda been moving around so 

426.26 428.87 A: you do that when you're young and don't have responsibilities you 

428.90 430.41 B: right 

429.58 431.76 A: can look back and go i'm glad i did that cool 

431.79 433.88 B: yeah it can be easier 

435.81 442.77 A: very cool do you know what they're gonna be i mean they're studying speech patterns and how people talk and communicate and 

442.40 448.41 B: yeah i it's it's hard to say i i don't know what they're looking for like i don't know if 

448.47 454.22 B: um they're looking to see you know how people from different regions how they talk or 

454.55 464.16 B: um your education and what words you i don't really know i mean i don't know if they get people to stick to the topic i i don't really know what they're looking for so 

464.88 472.68 B: [laughter] they send a letter thank you but you know you're rejected from anything further and i'm like well i did something wrong so [laughter] 

471.93 475.57 A: right [laughter] well that are they requiring you to do so many sessions 

475.79 476.80 B: um 

476.81 480.00 B: no just what i saw that you could do 

480.31 484.52 B: up to three i guess and then they may ask you to do more 

484.18 487.80 A: i see yeah and it's the same for i'm in seattle so 

487.37 488.36 B: okay 

487.99 489.55 A: same type of thing 

489.18 490.65 B: right 

490.46 492.14 A: but it was through 

493.02 500.27 A: through a group that i worked with and they always you know well sometimes they'll shoot you over an email oh they're looking for this type of you know they want you to look 

500.32 502.73 A: they want you to do a little part time job for them 

502.33 503.70 B: right 

503.01 504.87 A: so that's how i found it 

504.70 512.25 B: yeah i mean in a way this study is ah along the topic of ah you know computers in affecting education 'cause 

512.26 515.05 B: you learn new there's always something else 

515.18 524.53 B: um a way into something i mean hey you know we're looking around and we find okay here's a study that we actually found on line 

525.13 529.99 B: and they're you know through word of mouth and say okay you go on line and sign up so 

530.14 535.18 B: it's really becoming limitless how much you can do and then that all affects um 

535.29 543.59 B: you know personal information and identity theft and how much is gonna happen like when you sign up you're gonna get they wanted your social security number 

543.58 552.25 A: yeah that yeah they want wanted all that information i'm always a little hesitant but because i've done these things enough it's like well that's the risk you take 

551.85 552.81 B: right 

553.68 555.86 B: exactly 

554.74 558.51 A: you know it's still there's a lot of information about you out there 

559.21 562.55 B: right yeah it's kinda disturbing so 

561.97 563.38 A: yeah that's what kind of bothers 

565.38 569.29 A: me you can't let it i guess if that's what you you take the risk as long as you understand it 

569.10 574.39 B: right some things are i guess easier to accept than others so 

574.08 575.56 A: that's true it 

574.92 589.23 B: this one seemed pretty reputable to me plus i guess i guess it's a fisher study actually i worked um as an intern in the actual physical lauder fisher building so 

589.16 591.26 B: i'm like oh hey so 

591.82 593.85 B: that was kinda cool 

592.89 594.40 A: must be okay then [laughter] 

594.08 596.77 B: yeah so that was interesting 

597.65 599.95 B: wow it seems like this has been a lot longer than ten minutes
