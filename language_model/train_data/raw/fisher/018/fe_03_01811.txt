0.01 1.71 B: hi i'm tony 

1.19 2.72 A: i'm cindy 

2.38 3.39 B: hi 

2.98 4.17 A: how are you [mn] 

3.59 4.80 B: okay 

5.26 7.82 A: um that's a tough question [laughter] 

7.02 18.32 B: [laughter] um i don't know yeah i mean sometimes it can help because like i know with kids and they have a lot of questions like it's easier to just go look it up than to actually look in a book 

8.85 10.98 A: 'cause yes and no [mn] 

14.63 15.94 A: mhm 

17.85 24.18 A: as as research goes yeah but i also see my nieces and nephews kind of say that's what they're going to go do 

23.75 25.88 B: [laughter] 

25.09 27.92 A: [laughter] and go elsewhere on the computer 

27.01 31.36 B: right but then again it's like it's good if like the library is closed 

30.71 33.76 A: yeah i think it's more helpful though i really do 

33.64 36.46 B: yeah i mean yeah definitely 

33.90 35.18 A: it's easier 

36.15 38.25 A: and i think it's uh quicker 

38.25 39.54 B: yeah 

38.71 40.20 A: most definitely 

40.65 46.69 B: i think that um it makes it easier also for like reports and stuff like it looks neater when they do the projects 

44.32 45.26 A: mhm 

46.28 48.97 A: well you can print it out and keep an eye on it 

48.48 53.22 B: right but then again like that also like takes away from being creative 

53.16 54.58 A: you're right [laughter] 

54.16 56.89 B: because then you're not like coloring and drawing 

55.74 59.99 A: they're going to copy pictures and stuff right off the computer right 

58.38 62.37 B: right so and then again it does make kids lazier 

61.99 63.04 A: mhm 

63.17 69.56 A: in a way yeah that's what i was just going to say in a way going to the library is going to make them do a little more research too i [laughter] think 

68.75 73.93 B: yeah but not really i mean you go to the library and it takes you like forever just to find a book 

72.73 73.83 A: that's true 

74.51 75.58 A: yeah 

75.49 79.81 B: but then that also takes away from kids knowing actually how to use the library 

78.89 80.22 A: mhm 

81.18 83.23 A: i think it's good in the schools though 

83.18 84.19 B: yeah 

83.29 87.97 A: i think they are monitored -tored enough that the teachers know they're doing their work and 

88.55 90.66 A: i think it's helpful in education 

90.91 96.39 B: yeah but i mean not all the schools have like that many like each classroom might just have one 

95.91 100.26 A: mhm yeah yeah my niece is a teacher and there's one in her classroom 

99.72 102.80 B: and all the kids kind of have to like crowd around and fight 

101.67 102.49 A: (( yes )) 

102.77 105.06 A: yeah that's exactly it it's not like 

105.17 107.10 A: little kids sixth grade 

107.34 108.27 B: right 

108.10 111.38 A: in high school i'm sure they have more of the computers in there 

111.45 117.20 B: yeah but i guess they could take turns like if they say okay you know ten minutes each kid or something like that 

116.06 124.28 A: mhm i think that's what she does or if she is showing them one specific thing it's true they crowd around [mn] i mean she has a small class but 

119.98 120.99 B: (( right )) 

121.77 122.97 B: mhm 

124.54 126.91 B: but then they could also use it as a reward 

126.94 127.87 A: yeah 

127.82 130.34 B: like they could do games and things like that 

129.07 131.78 A: if someone did something good yeah definitely 

131.19 135.93 B: but educational games [laughter] that's another drawback 

132.80 134.71 A: [laughter] 

135.22 137.36 A: (( [laughter] )) 

137.42 140.61 B: because kids want to play like the action games and like 

139.76 144.97 A: yeah that's what my nephew kind of did would steer away from the homework 

145.74 147.10 B: it's interesting 

147.45 152.19 A: and that is a good question i never really thought about it as being really negative 

152.29 155.75 A: as a teaching thing i mean if the kids are being watched and 

156.20 161.20 A: [sigh] that's what they're doing while they're at school or if the parents are watching at home it's not a problem 

160.77 168.25 B: right but then i guess it could also take away because then they like you said go visit sites that like they're not supposed to be visiting and doing stuff 

166.78 169.23 A: yeah or chatting with friends 

168.72 171.18 B: yeah exactly [laughter] 

169.58 170.98 A: [laughter] 

171.34 172.08 A: (( [mn] )) 

171.35 175.27 B: exactly i get every once in a while i get an instant message from uh 

175.31 180.23 B: (( my little cousin can you tell me and i'm like look go look it up yourself )) 

176.46 177.60 A: yeah 

179.36 181.76 A: my niece does that all the time [laughter] 

180.99 182.43 B: [laughter] 

181.87 185.16 A: it drives me crazy actually [laughter] 

184.98 189.74 B: it's like for her to type it to send it to me she could type it into a search 

187.36 188.39 A: [laughter] 

189.31 192.13 A: that's right she could have searched for it by then 

192.59 194.10 B: it's crazy 

193.73 195.57 A: i think kids like it though 

195.89 202.17 A: i think i think really they i mean they go on to play but they realize there's so much they can look up also 

201.90 207.61 B: right like they never they never have like an i don't know to their question because there's always an answer 

202.28 202.95 A: some 

205.70 206.68 A: right 

206.95 213.25 A: even if it's something with i know i had a foster kid and she was amazed that she could go on and look at disney stuff 

213.21 214.30 B: mhm 

213.48 216.14 A: and some of it was educational the disney site 

215.81 216.84 B: right 

216.30 218.35 A: i didn't mind her playing around on there 

217.89 219.19 B: [laughter] 

218.63 220.79 A: (( [laughter] hey you can play games )) 

221.08 225.07 A: but i yeah i think it just depends on the child and helps schools 

225.03 228.50 B: yeah i guess it also depends on like how they're brought up like 

228.51 230.62 B: if they're told yeah you can learn 

230.95 231.85 A: yeah 

231.06 233.13 B: or if they're told oh just go play 

232.70 234.65 A: it's not just for games 

234.17 235.13 B: right 

236.15 237.40 B: it's interesting 

237.61 240.33 A: adults too [laughter] 

238.56 244.60 B: [laughter] oh that's a different story [laughter] [laughter] 

240.75 242.98 A: (( [laughter] )) 

243.88 246.63 A: [mn] because when i was in college 

247.05 254.89 A: i i think computers well i'm not i'm not really old but i mean it was just kind of like you could take the classes yeah and i didn't 

251.22 252.99 B: just starting 

253.81 254.78 B: mhm 

255.87 258.85 A: [mn] so i just kind of had to learn on my own for my job [mn] 

258.21 265.84 B: right yeah when i was in school the computers were just starting to come out and you can do it if you wanted to but you didn't have to 

261.27 262.33 A: yeah 

265.21 266.86 A: yeah they didn't push you 

266.74 274.90 B: right but i think that also like it kind of takes away i think now it's like you learn to type before you even learn how to write 

273.05 274.10 A: mhm 

274.66 276.13 A: that that's true 

276.18 283.38 A: i i have to admit i just i watch them even my nephew two little fingers he can really whip through that keyboard [sigh] 

281.81 283.04 B: mhm 

283.40 287.08 B: and i'm just like wow like how do they know how to type so well 

283.44 284.32 A: i mean 

285.97 287.15 A: mhm 

287.44 290.74 A: so actually i have to go with the benefit 

290.50 291.76 B: yeah that's often 

291.54 297.30 A: because i remember i have to take typing in school and probably now there's typing classes in school i don't know 

296.81 302.15 B: yeah probably not i mean they probably just have a computer class that teaches them how to type 

297.63 298.89 A: [laughter] 

299.73 300.88 A: mhm 

301.53 305.93 A: exactly because there are programs where you can follow along with the guide and 

305.49 307.59 B: right press a press b. 

306.61 307.87 A: yeah 

307.72 309.62 B: and just kind of type along 

309.35 310.92 A: that is a good point 

311.18 313.50 A: it probably eliminates some other classes 

313.60 315.25 B: yeah 

316.06 323.19 A: i remember that too all my friends were taking it and i was kind of like you know whatever [laughter] what class [laughter] [mn] 

319.98 321.90 B: [laughter] 

323.60 325.49 A: i'll skip that class 

324.78 326.11 B: (( [laughter] it's )) 

326.15 328.36 B: (( an easy class though [laughter] )) 

327.30 334.35 A: [mn] but it's kind of s- i think it's easier to learn i mean we can take classes through my job too and i'm amazed 

332.51 333.30 B: (( oh )) 

334.66 341.12 A: i've gone to a few classes and i know the basics but there's people that's actually walked out because they didn't even know how to use the mouse or anything 

340.68 342.02 B: wow 

341.21 344.26 A: and i was like okay [mn] how old are you [laughter] 

343.31 350.09 B: that's weird yeah i know i've taken one of those exams for like a job like a job required that i take an exam 

344.29 345.40 A: yeah 

349.28 351.83 A: right i have that because i work for the state we take 

351.19 355.95 B: and it was weird though because i scored like high on the advanced 

355.98 359.48 B: and low in the beginner and i'm like that's not possible 

359.11 360.62 A: really 

359.98 361.21 B: yeah 

361.39 365.70 B: but i think the advas- advanced was more like keyboard shortcuts 

365.32 366.32 A: ah 

366.29 369.28 B: and the beginner was like stupid stuff 

366.33 367.25 A: yeah 

368.88 376.60 A: exactly we have tests like that and everyone passes the easy bottom one i mean the higher one but the ones below 

374.44 375.42 B: right 

376.74 379.47 B: (( i don't understand how it works that way but )) 

377.28 378.75 A: are more technical 

379.82 380.57 A: (( because )) 

379.90 382.50 B: i guess that's just the way their system is set up 

382.18 386.75 A: i think i i was some basic excel classes and these people just walked right out 

387.06 388.50 B: (( that's weird )) 

387.86 391.58 A: and i'm like what you got to have to know something [mn] 

390.29 395.71 B: yeah i mean at at least have some kind of contact with the computer i mean nowadays everyone 

395.95 401.72 A: that's why it's it is good for them to use it in education because they're going to no matter what do they down the road 

401.59 403.61 B: mhm 

402.46 404.42 A: one one of my supervisors is 

404.51 407.58 A: lividly ex- she's just afraid of the internet [noise] 

407.77 408.84 B: wow 

408.29 414.26 A: and most of my job is on the internet so she has no clue 'cause she i'm like just sit with me it's not that bad and 

413.65 417.68 B: my aunt is like in her eighties and she just got a computer 

417.96 419.62 A: she loves it probably 

417.99 429.28 B: and she loves it [laughter] she's like it's my new toy i love this thing and she's like looking at recipes and trying to find relatives and 

422.29 423.27 A: [laughter] 

426.18 427.50 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

428.68 434.93 A: i think that's well if they do start young then that's what's going to happen they are going to be excited they will have something to do later in life 

434.34 439.76 B: and then she just likes it because she can keep in contact with people because she's so far away 

437.76 438.67 A: yeah 

439.26 442.22 A: (( yeah [noise] yeah [noise] that is )) 

441.47 445.40 B: i mean that's also teaching like a completely different generation 

444.99 454.02 A: well that's the other good thing the kids you see on t._v. write into the you know the air force and the army overseas so that that's a benefit 

451.01 452.04 B: right 

453.38 456.51 B: yeah but i definitely think it's like taking over 

456.34 459.40 A: well yeah [laughter] [laughter] 

456.94 462.52 B: [laughter] it's just beyond belief just my gosh 

462.11 464.41 A: there's no books any more pretty soon 

463.30 464.95 B: no 

464.63 467.68 A: well you can take college courses on line now 

466.73 468.62 B: yeah that too that's co- 

467.91 469.93 A: one of my bosses did that 

469.79 470.89 B: (( oh )) 

471.35 475.79 A: he just sat there at home he just read along i don't know if i would like that 

475.59 480.45 B: yeah it's not really that structured i mean you have you'd probably have like a lot of distractions 

479.86 485.85 A: that's what i said we talked about it and i said to him you know i think yeah i'd be watching t._v. listening to radio doing laundry 

485.46 488.31 B: yeah you know exactly like sitting 

486.62 487.52 A: [laughter] 

488.88 491.56 B: it's hard to sit still for something like that 

490.59 499.00 A: yeah you're not told to sit still so [laughter] i think my mind would just be he did it got his masters degree on line [laughter] 

492.51 494.98 B: [laughter] 

499.05 500.88 B: that's crazy 

500.09 501.67 A: i'm like wow [laughter] 

501.80 506.98 A: i don't know if i don't know how you did it because i would be whatever doing the dishes doing playing the dog 

504.48 506.12 B: yeah like 

506.53 509.76 B: i don't know who would actually take that seriously though 

509.43 512.57 A: it counts because it's legitimate colleges 

512.39 513.65 B: (( i guess )) 

512.82 514.88 A: it costs more money but 

515.60 518.24 A: i mean our job paid for it so he didn't care 

517.12 518.89 B: yeah so he didn't care 

518.83 521.94 A: but i'm like oh no i don't know if that's a benefit 

521.81 524.46 B: yeah i guess you're learning 

524.55 529.15 B: it's not the traditional way but now they do the s._a._t. on line too 

528.70 530.18 A: oh i didn't know that 

529.54 533.59 B: yeah it's completely converted to computer 

532.48 537.21 A: so when the the kids go that's how they take the s._a._t. no way 

534.81 539.77 B: mhm they go into they go into they go into a classroom and every person has a computer 

539.93 540.78 A: i had 

540.01 545.85 B: and if you want to skip something you just like click on the box that says skip and then you could go back to it later on 

545.55 547.08 A: i didn't know that 

546.44 552.94 B: but that totally messes up your way of learning because if you are used to learning through a book and then you're being tested on the computer 

553.40 555.75 B: i think that kind of throws things off 

555.02 558.98 A: yeah that is weird i didn't know that at all wow 

558.20 563.17 B: yeah that's been going on for a at least maybe four or five years now 

563.84 566.07 B: and in the beginning you had the option 

566.20 571.08 B: you could take the paper or the computer and now i think the computer is mandatory 

566.22 567.57 A: you could do either one 

572.28 575.71 A: wow that's true though because what if you're like i don't know 

575.99 578.73 B: i think if you're just so used to using the computer 

578.31 581.06 A: yeah you would have to really know the computer 

581.10 584.88 A: to be able to scroll and like you said press the boxes and 

584.30 587.85 B: yeah and to go back i think that's kind of hard though just because they 

587.88 591.38 B: i think you're when you're learning you're used to your surroundings 

590.77 591.93 A: yeah 

591.57 595.20 B: and then taking a test on a computer is completely different 

594.85 595.71 A: (( yeah it is )) 

595.37 598.97 B: because it's not your normal learning surroundings it's like 

599.05 599.89 B: a different envir-
