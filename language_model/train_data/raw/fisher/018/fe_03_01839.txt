13.93 20.24 A: oh wow cool so what odd how these things bring us together [laughter] 

19.52 22.15 B: [laughter] yeah 

22.32 25.76 A: okay well they said computers and education 

25.72 30.05 B: yeah whether we think it is ah harmful or beneficial 

30.23 31.12 B: i guess 

30.47 36.20 A: i think that's what they want to know [laughter] i don't know go ahead 

34.08 35.12 B: well 

36.09 46.18 B: let's see um i really i don't have a lot of education i just um completed high school graduated high school and that was it i really didn't get a lot of ah 

46.17 51.95 B: education on the computer at you know in high school and i have never been to college um 

52.12 61.52 B: i feel like ah having a computer in my home is very beneficial to me i can research pretty much any subject i want on the internet and 

61.59 64.01 B: come up with ah you know 

64.24 68.58 B: information [laughter] whether it is relevant or not i can always look at the source 

66.88 67.88 A: yeah 

68.92 76.87 B: but without my computer i really would be i think cut off from the information superhighway 

77.12 86.06 A: yeah i agree with that i only well let's see i went to high school and i did a year and a half of college either way i never touched a computer 

86.21 94.14 A: in either place we had typewriters [laughter] we didn't use computers they were just starting to be popular enough to even go 

94.92 100.98 A: in schools but i wasn't in the courses that had them [mn] we ah 

101.12 107.69 A: as far as computers in schools and all i think it's fantastic because it is the way the world is going anyway 

108.30 115.90 A: the kids are going to need to learn how to use this as quick as they can we already have two in our house and we have the kids on them 

115.99 122.79 A: not all the time but they play every game they play is educational they only have a couple that are just games 

122.86 126.27 A: so i believe that computers and education have they 

126.37 128.42 A: are going to walk hand in hand 

128.64 131.89 A: and from what i heard on the news they said that it 

132.14 138.45 A: was like california or something has already gone to a totally computerized classrooms 

138.41 139.73 B: (( [mn] really )) 

139.64 145.35 A: yeah somewhere i don't know it may be just a project that you know that they are doing 

145.26 159.94 A: to see how it goes but from what i understood they are going to have a professor but all their textbooks type stuff's going to be on the computer their tests are computerized it is all like you just go in you sit down you sit at a computer all day 

160.24 163.02 A: which i don't know if that is going to be the way to go 

163.06 168.96 A: but it would broaden our it would make it cheaper on the schools to offer things 

169.05 171.60 A: if they could use the computers that way 

171.75 173.40 A: for certain things 

173.56 185.96 B: i think that there should still be you know some supervision with the teacher present to gui- help guide them i mean you can't replace the you know one on one um 

185.77 187.10 A: oh yeah 

186.51 193.92 B: interaction with with the teacher and other class mates i mean i guess it does detract somewhat from ah 

193.93 202.69 B: people having social interaction with their peers but for the most part i mean it definitely helps with education because 

202.58 210.33 B: most jobs that you get these days you need to have some sort of computer knowledge and tha- it's just going to be increasing in the future 

210.46 217.19 B: um the need for computers and without that training you're really going to be left in the dust 

217.44 220.75 A: well that's the way i feel i feel like it's the way 

220.91 231.70 A: kids have to be taught and if they are not taught young by the time they are teenagers high school and even ready to go out into the world it is going to be so far ahead of them 

232.18 242.08 A: they are not going to know which way's up because everything is out there on the computer on the internet somewhere and it just takes that education to dig it out 

242.44 252.77 A: and a lot of trial and error and [laughter] a lot of those other searches that you do that you just you'd never get nowhere and then all of a sudden you hit the right word pattern 

252.75 253.67 B: yeah 

252.80 256.04 A: and you find out more than you ever thought you could find out 

256.11 263.12 A: anyway [mn] but i think i mean even the libraries here where i'm at are computerized now 

263.15 270.12 A: we don't have the card catalogues and all that stuff we [laughter] used to learn in school you have everything is on a computer disk 

263.20 264.06 B: (( oh yeah )) 

271.10 273.71 A: it's just amazing where it's gone to 

271.19 272.06 B: yeah 

273.73 285.03 B: yeah yeah i don't think that um children under the age of eighteen should have um exposure to the internet at school but they should definitely get on the computer at school 

285.04 291.95 B: um the internet is more for you know something you should experience at you know at home but 

291.31 294.82 A: yeah with more one on one supervision not 

294.89 298.15 A: thirteen of them in a room going anywhere they want to go 

297.85 299.86 B: yeah absolutely 

299.09 306.80 A: i agree with there too i think the internet as far as in schools in a special circumstance would work but 

306.84 311.24 A: in general knowing the kids around here no [laughter] 

311.41 315.38 A: they all want to all they want to learn about is the movie stars and the 

315.79 325.57 A: [mn] you know the same things every generation has liked but we had magazines we read and instead of reading magazines they just get on a computer and do it that way 

326.41 333.21 A: you know at least they are reading so that part's not there and their knowledge of typing and all that's there but 

333.30 337.04 A: they would do it in school all hours of the day if they had the ability 

336.98 338.64 B: (( [laughter] )) 

338.63 343.44 B: let's see i was born in nineteen seventy four and my parents 

343.36 353.65 B: did buy a computer when i was young we had a texas instrument i don't even think the internet was around at that point and um 

353.74 355.01 B: you know we had 

355.09 367.63 B: a lot of games that were for educational purposes we had math games and reading games and um memory type games and that's that's really all that 

359.40 360.35 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

367.80 374.30 B: we had we didn't have a lot of ah you know games for entertainment on the texas instrument at that point 

374.20 375.20 A: yeah 

374.32 378.44 B: things really have changed since the texas instrument came out [laughter] [laughter] 

377.72 386.97 A: yeah hasn't it [laughter] we had all the texas instruments the computerized toys the speak and spell the math and 

387.32 388.24 A: (( ah )) 

388.26 397.71 A: spell i guess is what you call it it was speak and math i think my parents were big on the texas instrument educational toys but we didn't have a computer 

397.95 399.93 A: i was born in sixty nine 

399.96 411.86 A: so i'm not much older than you but enough [laughter] just enough that we i don't know we didn't have a computer and the first computer that my grandparents bought for their business filled up a room 

412.21 418.52 A: and i think they bought it in the early seventies and it was the size of like a ten by twelve bedroom 

418.89 425.82 A: you know it was just gigantic it was like watching the um old t._v. shows where it took up a whole room 

425.97 430.66 A: for all those big wheelized looking computers and all it was that kind of a thing 

430.70 432.95 A: but we weren't allowed to touch it 

430.71 431.77 B: do you feel 

432.71 435.82 B: do you feel it was beneficial to have that then 

435.63 442.57 A: they needed it it helped with the book work and it helped with their stuff but they didn't have that internet access then 

436.99 437.90 B: oh 

442.39 443.50 B: yeah 

443.12 456.65 A: and when it came time to upgrade it you know to the smaller versions where the guys kind of put it on their desks and oh my grandmother is like no the one we have still works it's fine and she kind of got left in the dust 

456.63 459.03 A: because now computers are hand size 

459.22 460.15 A: and 

460.70 465.79 A: that other one is so obsolete i don't even think they could fix it if anything ever happened to 

465.63 466.44 B: [laughter] 

466.37 472.60 A: it it is so ol- it is one of those that just you know will be in a museum some day [laughter] 

473.38 478.72 A: because i think it it wasn't the first computer that came out but it is one of those first few 

479.00 484.65 A: that came out for businesses generally you didn't see people it wasn't a family size 

485.08 494.09 A: but she oh she just thought she was something getting that but they did they were able to store more information and do things quicker 

494.79 497.66 A: so even then the computers were great 

498.81 499.96 A: (( they ah )) 

500.26 509.06 A: like here in town i substitute teach over here at the elementary school my kids go to and the kids my son plays on a computer every day 

509.25 517.73 A: he has math games and reading games and spelling and he has to keep going till he can get it right to go to the next level 

517.98 521.31 A: and i think those are great that is what i have here at my house 

521.50 534.80 A: basically the same games and then some and i think the kids have like one minute to pacman but i never see them play it they don't want to get on there and play the games they like doing more the that reader rabbit 

535.41 538.85 A: they like reader rabbit because the rabbit talks to them 

538.84 539.99 B: [laughter] 

539.28 547.58 A: and teach even though they are learning something they think it is funny because if they mess up he'll say no no no we got to go back and we got to hunt for the information 

547.72 551.17 A: to make this work and the kids love it 

551.09 556.65 B: so your students do have access to educational programs at school then 

556.34 562.94 A: yeah they just put it in about two years ago they got there's at least one computer in every room 

563.31 564.72 A: and then 

565.03 569.98 A: i think here just the last this year i believe it was 

570.60 574.97 A: bill gates with microsoft donated so many computers 

575.39 577.07 A: i don't know whether it was 

577.16 585.01 A: nationwide or just select areas or if you had to be a poverty school but each teacher got one of those 

584.97 596.41 A: and so most of the teachers i think one out of every five teachers up there at the school has the internet access to their computer but the students are not allowed to use that 

596.99 599.52 A: because they said they cannot protect them
