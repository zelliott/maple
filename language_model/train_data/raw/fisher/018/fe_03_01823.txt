7.43 11.39 A: [laughter] okay [noise] um so 

11.57 15.20 A: [noise] as far as computers go in education um [noise] 

15.44 20.95 A: i think that they're important [noise] um that you know the internet does require reading 

21.08 25.41 A: probably a whole lot more reading than they would do watching tv [laughter] 

25.74 34.21 B: yeah and it opens opens a whole new world a lot of information's available that would not be normally available ah 

25.78 26.99 A: (( and [noise] [noise] [mn] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

34.22 39.04 B: to the run of the mill child um i don't know if you live in a big town or 

35.94 36.51 A: (( [noise] )) 

39.07 42.11 B: a small town but i live in a pretty small town 

42.43 46.65 B: and the local library just can't keep up [laughter] 

46.47 47.50 A: right 

47.22 48.10 B: so 

48.10 50.83 A: i live in a pretty small town too but [noise] um 

50.89 55.28 A: the the closest library you have to drive to it's about twenty minutes away 

55.77 57.05 A: (( and [noise] )) 

55.92 61.70 B: well yeah that would be the same here and and that would mean i would have to provide transportation 

61.88 65.92 B: for the most part so it makes it a lot more convenient [noise] 

62.89 63.81 A: right 

65.18 66.19 A: right 

66.41 72.85 A: i think [cough] as far as them being in the schools i think that's great because if they don't have a computer at home 

73.05 75.90 A: then [noise] they're at least taught the basics 

75.87 90.24 A: and um once they get to high school and start taking even more um involved computer classes and internet classes [noise] i know my son is in [noise] the fifth grade and he takes and he has um internet access at school 

90.27 96.39 A: um i know it is protected and everything else and i think it's great for him although we have computers [noise] at home 

96.80 98.90 A: [cough] and he does most of his 

98.94 101.25 A: um [noise] computer stuff here 

101.36 108.27 A: but um but there are computers at school and for kids that don't have access at home [noise] that's an excellent [noise] 

107.50 110.96 B: yes and they and they have improved as far as ah 

111.25 118.41 B: ah making sure that they have enough available m- my daughter is nineteen but i have my niece and nephew that live with me 

118.18 119.01 A: (( ahah [noise] )) 

118.63 125.23 B: um and they're eleven and seven and when my daughter went to elementary school 

124.83 125.67 A: (( [cough] [noise] )) 

125.27 134.81 B: you know they had like two computers and you got every other week you got to get fifteen minutes on it [laughter] so you know so it was ah 

131.48 133.04 A: (( wow [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

134.71 135.29 A: (( [noise] )) 

135.52 148.69 B: [lipsmack] even in high school ah you know it was it was limited she graduated last year it was limited because of the number of computers and i know now that they're expanding but they still haven't reached the point where 

148.67 151.60 B: everybody that needs to have access 

153.05 155.42 B: to a computer i mean i i 

155.45 162.14 B: look for the day when everybody has as computer at their desk and they're the teacher is there and the computer is there and they work 

161.61 162.21 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

162.64 165.39 A: right write on the computer [noise] [noise] 

164.39 173.46 B: right at the same time with the lecturers the the the visuals um i i think that would you know work out excellently 

168.08 169.01 A: mhm 

172.91 178.56 A: [noise] [noise] yeah i've seen um now my son was having some issues with reading in elementary school 

178.69 193.30 A: and um [noise] i bought some programs to help him with reading and he happened to like like ah you know mummies and egyptian stuff and there just happened to be this program for reading that involved egyptians 

188.52 189.69 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

193.51 208.13 A: and i was like oh this would be perfect you know and his reading grade in six months went up um an entire grade level [noise] and thanks to computers you know which i wouldn't have been able to do [noise] on my own and no teacher would have been able to do [noise] 

207.23 212.69 B: right because they they geared it to something he was very interested in that's excellent [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [mn] [noise] [mn] 

211.86 220.13 A: right and in in my opinion education and computers are great for education because they are interactive they make it fun 

220.38 233.74 A: and um kids can kids learn better when it is fun anyway and anything that is hands on where they actually other than writing the only thing is [noise] is that they don't write as much if they're typing instead 

233.97 237.80 A: um but i think i think that with the new 

237.92 242.85 A: with the new ah the new way things are now it's [mn] you know writing is 

242.93 252.63 A: becoming somewhat obsolete although reading is becoming more of a [noise] ah necessity you know because of the internet you have to read [noise] to be on the internet 

251.08 251.90 B: yeah 

252.93 262.51 A: and that was an incentive [noise] i used for my son [noise] i said well you have to read to be able to get your codes for your video games on the internet [laughter] [noise] [mn] 

261.87 268.54 B: that's the the only thing that i see with the two younger ones is ah an all out 

268.59 274.59 B: they they get addicted to it you know you have to really set limits and it's very difficult to set the limits 

274.17 275.26 A: (( mhm )) 

274.60 277.70 B: um because they want to be on it 

277.73 288.35 B: mor- you know morning noon and night and some of it's for the right reason and then some of it's just the video games and you know i think that i think that it's 

288.79 290.62 B: ah they confuse 

290.07 291.28 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [mn] [noise] )) 

290.75 291.74 B: the 

292.50 296.95 B: they just look at it [mn] as if all of it as fun and games 

295.88 297.24 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] right )) 

297.06 301.41 B: and w- while that does peak their interest it also um 

301.84 302.42 A: (( [noise] )) 

302.07 308.38 B: i mean my ah my niece is is somewhat overweight and [laughter] i just don't think she gets out enough you know she's not outside 

308.38 323.36 B: i mean when we were kids we walked we did this and we did you know we were outside playing constantly and i just i do see where that has a tendency to be a problem because i don't care what they say these kids have a mind of their own no matter how many rules you send down 

311.89 312.87 A: right 

322.90 324.35 A: (( [noise] [noise] oh yeah [noise] )) 

323.18 328.44 B: you know [laughter] they don't listen and they can be very stubborn [laughter] [laughter] 

327.09 332.70 A: oh yes indeed you got that right i mean my son is a little overweight now um 

332.72 338.11 A: and thank [noise] god though he has sparked in he's a a boy scout and 

338.14 344.24 A: me and him do that together so that that provides a lot of um [noise] exercise in the summer 

344.35 349.38 A: and um if you get him interested in some sort of outdoor activity usually that will 

349.49 352.71 A: get them to go outside and get you know [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

351.22 359.08 B: [noise] yeah but i think it depends on the child too my like i said my niece it i mean it is like the computer that is like her thing you know with the 

359.02 370.07 B: um you know [mn] i monitor it but it it it and i limited it but it just i mean i find i fear getting up in the middle of the night and she gets on the computer for whatever reason 

369.29 371.29 A: (( [noise] [noise] [laughter] [noise] )) 

369.96 376.33 B: you know to go to the bathroom so that you know [laughter] and i know that's not for educational purposes 

371.35 372.11 A: [mn] 

375.81 380.24 A: no she's probably checking her email [laughter] [laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

376.64 377.68 B: [laughter] 

377.70 385.56 B: or something you know something and it just you know it's like i said [mn] even though they're and and i have a 

385.33 395.69 B: i don't know about you i have this real i mean i know there is these guards that you can put on these pro- programs that you can put on but i have a real um fear of downloading 

395.98 409.20 B: things because of the spy availability when you download something so [laughter] you know [mn] i mean even programs that you buy just don't i i don't know maybe i'm a pessimist i just don't trust 

399.17 399.96 A: right 

400.28 401.40 A: mhm 

409.48 410.29 B: (( you know )) 

410.44 416.04 B: anything i mean really have to have a ah a lot of word of mouth and a lot of um 

416.43 417.37 B: um 

419.16 430.01 B: checking into and a lot of you know a lot of experts that are wiser as me as far as you know how these people can get into things because i know when i get on all of a sudden i have this 

430.26 439.84 B: i have this new ah new bar up or you know something and i s- i never put that on there how did that get there so you know you just you know 

436.11 437.56 A: (( [noise] [noise] [mn] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] right [noise] [noise] )) 

440.05 444.73 B: you just [mn] and and i did a a couple of checks about like porn 

444.83 452.92 B: (( and and there's these porn sites nobody here visits porn sites [laughter] i mean where are they coming from i mean you know so )) 

449.94 450.89 A: [mn] 

451.14 452.05 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

452.93 454.68 B: (( you know that i do have )) 

454.72 455.68 B: um 

455.80 462.44 B: a somewhat of a fear of and you know there's there's that that kind of hesitancy with it but you know i still pretty much 

458.09 458.99 A: (( right [noise] [noise] )) 

462.87 467.01 B: you know allow them because i think that in the future 

467.52 482.06 B: if they don't have ah education on how to how to work a computer how to understand some of it i i just wish the schools would get a little more um my daughter was majoring in that when she went to college and i 

481.05 482.65 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

482.08 494.32 B: noticed that that i mean even though she knew a lot about web design and and she still didn't know the meat a- about like how those programs get downloaded 

493.71 496.07 A: [noise] [noise] oh okay yeah 

494.35 495.32 B: (( you know and )) 

495.38 502.29 B: and it's like i think that there's there's this basic what everybody should know and that ought to be introduced 

498.76 499.33 A: (( [noise] )) 

502.19 502.77 A: (( [noise] )) 

502.43 504.65 B: you know in the elementary schools 

504.38 505.31 A: (( [noise] yes )) 

504.70 510.64 B: ah you know aside from just clicking here and clicking there i think they need to have some of kind of 

511.25 514.22 B: ah understanding of the mechanics 

513.41 513.97 A: (( [noise] )) 

513.88 524.18 A: right [noise] and i think um [noise] a lot of the extra curricular like boy scouts which i consider part of a ch- part of a child's education [noise] or a girl scout's [noise] 

524.08 533.23 A: um and as part of a child's education as well as school um but in school they teach my son practically nothing 

533.24 539.13 A: but with boy scouts as far as computers go he learns twice as much 

538.57 539.58 B: really 

539.36 542.93 A: yeah i mean he well i'm a web designer anyway 

542.37 543.95 B: oh [laughter] okay 

543.61 547.24 A: [laughter] [laughter] [noise] 

544.25 550.13 B: good i'm gonna ask ya g- get your number i can ask you all these questions when i when i get these stupid things [noise] mhm 

548.26 552.97 A: i i get all these you know i'm a computer geek and um 

553.14 560.28 A: so with boy scouts and stuff my son learns a whole lot more because he wants to get his computer mayor badge or his internet 

560.20 573.74 A: patch and things like [noise] that and so as far as education as far as the internet goes and stuff like that now in school they teach them safety they teach them basic [noise] how to receive and send e-mail 

573.76 583.87 A: and they teach them how to save files like in [noise] word and and simple programs but they don't teach them anything about h._t._m._l. they don't teach them anything about 

583.88 594.27 A: you know [noise] th- they just don't and i think they should know more and [noise] i think [noise] schools should have a._o._l. because a._o._l. will block any kind of porn 

594.31 599.95 A: um if you set the settings right [noise] um if you set the parental controls and sh-
