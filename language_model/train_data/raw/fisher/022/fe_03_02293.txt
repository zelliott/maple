0.79 2.46 A: hi i'm mary 

1.91 3.40 B: hi i'm heather 

2.98 4.19 A: hi heather 

4.19 6.29 B: this sounds like an interesting topic 

5.79 6.89 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

6.37 8.23 B: i had family the other day 

8.47 9.80 A: and 

9.43 18.91 B: um that was okay let's see with this well right now in nebraska the weather is really screwed up like yesterday it was seventy two and today it's fifty 

18.67 24.96 A: that's almost exactly like i'm in min- minneapolis the same thing it was gorgeous yesterday 

19.24 20.30 B: and raining 

22.02 22.80 B: oh 

24.70 30.53 B: so a couple weeks ago i had a cold that actually didn't last very long but i remember in february 

30.66 31.77 B: when 

32.02 33.68 B: we thought winter was 

33.85 38.72 B: you know going to behalf um i was like sick for three weeks [laughter] 

38.57 39.90 A: (( huh yeah )) 

39.51 44.53 B: i had a cold and then i got better and then the next day it was worse than it had been before 

44.64 48.49 B: and it seemed like everyone was passing it around school i go to the university 

48.94 61.17 A: yeah i think that happens a lot i know i was in office building and everyone was well not everyone was sick at the same time but there was it was like this huge germ just went from office to office 

52.35 53.24 B: mhm 

60.69 61.94 B: mhm 

61.30 65.62 A: and somebody in the complex was always sick and sneezing 

65.58 66.53 B: yes 

66.66 79.24 B: and then i i have a music education night class which is with some people doing masters degrees and they all teach during the day so then their elementary kids come to school sick and then they give it to the [laughter] college kids 

66.73 67.53 A: so 

72.14 73.02 A: mhm 

78.64 79.69 A: sure 

80.42 81.44 B: but i don't know 

81.93 85.57 B: i think going from winter to 

85.79 87.01 B: (( spring )) 

87.39 88.99 B: and spring to winter 

89.29 90.71 B: seems to 

90.86 92.51 B: bring a lot of illness here 

92.46 99.06 A: yeah and i i think a lot of that is caused by the fact that so many buildings now are air tight 

98.85 100.04 B: yeah 

99.72 108.36 A: and you you're not used to whatever the outside temperature is because you're in this controlled climate and then when you go outside and all of a sudden 

107.38 109.38 B: there's drastic change [laughter] 

108.77 110.90 A: yeah if the pollen has come out 

110.95 113.33 A: since you went to work in the morning 

113.52 115.18 A: it's gonna affect you 

115.01 116.92 B: yeah i agree with that 

117.30 122.05 B: i probably don't do enough to try to keep myself well i know i don't drink enough water 

122.65 125.49 B: and i don't get enough sleep when school's crazy you go home 

125.06 128.25 A: yeah well i used to it 

128.93 130.53 A: was funny um 

130.80 141.01 A: i would be really sick at night like getting a really bad cold and my voice would get bad my eyes were watering and i'd think oh for sure i'm not going to be able to go to work in the morning 

141.24 144.69 A: and then before i you know in the morning i was fine 

144.94 150.11 A: or just the opposite i would be fine in the morning and then when i got to work 

150.13 153.56 A: all of a sudden i would start to get sick and they would be like 

153.12 154.89 B: [laughter] 

153.77 155.39 A: you should go home 

155.67 167.40 B: i had the same thing in fact the last time i was sick i felt like i was getting a sore throat for about a week and then it's like i go to bed and my throat would hurt and then i'd get up in the morning and i'd be fine 

167.32 171.69 B: and then it would start again and then all of a sudden i had all this congestion and 

172.09 177.03 B: mess but i didn't have the sore throat any more it was kinda weird it was like i got the cold slowly 

174.87 175.81 A: yeah 

177.89 182.53 A: well people often ask me if i have allergies and i honestly don't know i 

180.50 181.27 B: (( mm )) 

182.86 184.84 A: nothing is severe 

185.19 186.08 A: i mean 

186.29 190.60 A: like it's i know people who are like if they're in a room with an onion 

190.76 193.06 A: their throat swells up and stuff 

192.18 193.79 B: oh yeah yeah 

193.18 194.03 A: but 

194.10 203.82 A: i don't know if i you know like i seem to get a runny nose frequently and they say do you have a cold and i no i don't think so i don't feel like i have a cold well then you must have allergies 

203.41 204.72 B: i'm the same way 

204.62 209.58 A: and i don't know if it's the change of the season and sure the pollen count is high but 

208.98 210.09 B: yeah 

209.67 212.32 A: it never stopped me from doing anything 

211.93 216.67 B: yeah and it's not like you're sneezing non stop and eyes will water and 

215.01 219.31 A: yeah i don't feel sick it's just annoying because my nose won't quit running 

219.08 219.68 B: (( mm )) 

220.34 232.20 B: well i had a a teacher in kansas once that thought echinacea was just the ultimate thing and she said that she had not been sick for years so i got some and i don't think it did anything for me 

232.50 234.55 A: i think a lot of that is mental 

234.21 235.25 B: i do too 

234.63 240.29 A: if you really believe it's going to make you better you're going to swear by it oh yeah i feel better 

237.56 238.36 B: yeah 

240.62 249.79 B: and there was something i don't remember what it was i got at walderings once it was some herbal thing that was just to make your cold not last as long i 

249.98 252.50 B: think it was something zinc based or something 

252.77 254.60 B: and i i don't really know 

255.08 262.98 B: because you can't really compare because sometimes you have a worse cold than another time so i didn't know if that did anything or not 

257.07 258.20 A: right 

260.36 261.53 A: mhm 

263.01 267.07 A: and like with the recording status you go to the doctor with a cold 

266.64 268.63 B: (( yeah it's going to last a week [laughter] )) 

268.08 270.63 A: [laughter] yeah otherwise it lasts seven days 

270.27 271.32 B: yeah 

270.70 275.14 A: i think that's very true except now they there is supposedly a medication that 

275.19 276.91 A: will get rid of a cold 

276.52 277.35 B: oh 

278.02 278.84 A: but 

279.28 281.92 A: i don't know is a cold really so awful 

281.75 292.43 B: yes yeah it could be a lot worse well i got a flu shot because everyone at school was saying that i should get a flu shot and it i never got the flu but i had some weird thing 

292.53 296.20 B: the middle of march where i had a fever and i had body aches 

296.88 303.03 B: but it was really minor it was just like you know a couple days or something and i don't know if that was still flu or what that was 

302.78 306.43 A: maybe it would have been a full blown flu if you hadn't had the shot 

305.55 307.58 B: yeah that's that's what i thought 

307.59 314.24 A: but i always kinda laugh at people who say people who say i had a flu shot and i didn't get the flu this winter i'm like well 

314.60 318.45 A: so how are we going to prove that without the shot [laughter] 

316.39 318.59 B: yeah yeah exactly 

318.84 320.32 B: you don't really know 

320.50 321.29 A: no 

322.12 323.84 B: but i don't know what else they'll 

323.88 326.80 B: they'll come up with they're always coming up with something new 

326.94 328.92 B: i had never had one before 

328.90 330.85 A: it's some i i was 

331.07 335.80 A: really ill the past two years and in and out of the hospital 

336.44 338.54 A: and the staff there 

338.67 340.48 A: they're always sick 

340.62 341.42 B: huh 

341.40 349.38 A: [laughter] like if hospital workers with all their cleanliness procedures and the gloves and everything 

349.39 353.97 A: can't stay well what hope is there for the rest of us [laughter] 

351.05 352.72 B: yeah how can we [laughter] 

354.48 356.84 B: yes that's true i take the um 

356.95 361.75 B: bus to school and i know that that's got all kinds of people with who knows what on it 

361.31 362.32 A: yeah 

362.21 366.45 B: before and after i get on there and why i'm on there and standing at the bus 

366.91 378.71 B: bus stop doesn't always help me there that's the worst thing in the winter because with that you'll be all bundled up and then the bus will come and you get on there the heat blasting and then you're all bundled up and you're on there for like ten minutes and then 

375.23 376.22 A: right 

378.61 381.92 B: you're just burning up and then you go outside and it's freezing so 

382.35 383.96 B: win- winter is not 

384.16 385.29 B: the best time 

385.54 387.83 A: you should try it in minnesota 

387.25 388.83 B: yeah i can imagine 

389.22 393.94 A: actually it hasn't been too bad the last couple of years except we had a real cold 

393.98 396.05 A: severely cold stretch 

395.73 396.45 B: (( mm )) 

396.72 402.42 A: and i didn't know what i was going to do i have a water bed and i had the heaters all cranked up as high as they would go 

402.52 405.08 A: and i had like six blankets on them 

405.11 408.60 A: and i could not get warm i didn't know what i was gonna do 

406.09 407.20 B: get warm 

408.96 409.88 B: (( well )) 

410.49 417.55 B: yeah it actually wasn't too bad here except we had probably our worst snow storm it was on april sixth 

417.80 419.57 B: after everything 

419.68 422.70 B: was spring like for two weeks 

423.09 434.20 B: and it was supposed to be a lot worse they had forecasted you know like a ton of snow and it was going to be really wet heavy snow because it was going to rain first and they were all worried about the trees 

434.21 442.62 B: and branches coming down and all of that but luckily it stayed rain longer than they had predicted but that was that was wild 

434.86 436.31 A: oh sure yeah 

442.80 443.73 A: yeah 

443.38 446.03 B: and then like two days later it was seventy 

446.31 450.36 A: is that that the same time when the east coast got all that snow 

449.72 453.16 B: yes yeah that was right bef- right after that i think 

453.32 456.05 A: i thought it was funny i was watching um 

456.68 459.97 A: some of the morning talk shows like regis and kelly 

459.50 460.66 B: mhm 

460.30 461.68 A: and he was 

461.97 471.09 A: what's the temperature now oh my god it's thirty three degrees and i was like what are you whining about that would be balmy for us 

465.18 466.23 B: [laughter] 

470.47 472.48 B: yeah yeah 

472.81 479.48 A: but then the as the snow accumulated i could see that it would be a real problem where do you put it in a city that size 

476.88 478.00 B: (( [laughter] yes )) 

479.23 482.97 B: yeah yeah i know even here they were like trucking it away 

484.31 486.90 A: yeah like a million dollars 

488.22 489.06 B: yeah 

488.45 492.61 A: a million dollars for every fifty tons i think 

492.61 493.51 B: wow 

493.71 496.82 A: and that's not much when you start filling a truck with snow 

496.66 497.76 B: yeah 

498.06 499.72 B: yeah especially if it's 

500.18 501.84 B: big heavy wet stuff 

501.58 502.49 A: yeah 

505.02 510.51 A: i know here they were um they had the trucks all ready to start sweeping the streets 

510.18 511.27 B: mhm 

510.99 515.69 A: and then the weatherman kept saying wow we got a big snow storm coming 

515.80 516.88 A: so they 

516.74 517.88 B: they were all ready 

517.06 523.67 A: took the street sweepers off the trucks put the plows back on got the sanding trucks loaded and ready to go 

523.73 525.58 A: and all it did was [laughter] rain 

525.04 526.46 B: oh gosh 

526.75 531.00 B: yeah probably this winter more than any other winter that i remember 

531.44 535.63 B: they would forecast snow all the time and then it'd either do nothing or rain 

535.60 536.41 A: yeah 

535.76 538.75 B: so like this storm on april sixth everyone was like 

538.87 542.54 B: oh it's gonna rain and then we get a huge storm there was one other 

542.62 545.49 B: time i think it was in october all of a sudden 

545.55 550.81 B: like three weeks in a row they'd been forecasting snow and it hadn't done anything and then all of a sudden 

551.03 553.52 B: they hadn't forecasted any and there was a ton 

553.67 554.59 A: yeah 

555.46 560.38 A: i think that's another reason why people may get sick more often when the seasons change 

558.81 559.69 B: yeah 

560.39 561.52 A: you kind of 

561.84 563.99 A: it's impossible to dress 

563.75 565.07 B: oh yeah 

564.52 568.88 A: you know like if you go to work in the morning and it's really really cold 

568.89 574.27 A: i know at least in minnesota it could be sixty degrees by the time you're ready to go home 

573.60 577.18 B: yeah i have that here especially right now 

575.43 577.06 A: or vice versa 

578.12 585.91 A: and then people always try and rush the seasons so they see you know as soon as it gets to be forty degrees people are walking around in shorts 

581.29 582.43 B: yeah 

585.26 588.83 B: yes yes [laughter] i saw that last week [laughter] 

586.50 587.49 A: [laughter] 

588.66 590.88 A: and they get their bicycles out 

590.34 591.23 B: yes 

590.94 592.60 A: and you know of course 

592.61 596.14 A: if you dress like that and you know then it rains 

596.32 598.39 A: you're probably gonna get sick 

597.60 598.84 B: mhm 

599.54 599.95 B: (( yeah ))
