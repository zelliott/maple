0.14 1.66 B: hi this is tom 

1.66 3.73 A: hi tom this is rebecca 

3.35 4.34 B: hi 

4.42 5.35 A: hi 

4.95 6.67 B: and basically 

6.68 13.76 B: i don't know i personally don't get sick when the season changes although i know some people that do from allergies 

13.70 15.25 A: mhm 

14.39 27.25 B: and i don't have any magic you know solution except i guess i [laughter] i take some vitamin c. and some friends of mine take vitamin c. and exercise i guess but i don't know 

27.72 30.00 A: [noise] i don't 

30.07 36.91 A: i i agree that the season the seasons changing do does affect people and um 

37.60 43.69 A: as far as what to use to feel better that i don't know it's hard to say 

43.33 44.55 B: mhm 

43.78 44.65 A: um 

44.80 47.40 A: i'm i'm sorry i need to have you hold on a second 

46.94 47.91 B: no problem 

48.18 51.31 A: (( it's again already so you just need to unload )) 

51.94 53.48 A: (( okay see you later )) 

55.00 55.91 A: um 

55.08 58.21 B: and do you yourself get affected by this or not 

58.32 60.37 B: as far as the seasons changing mm 

59.68 62.50 A: i do because of where i work 

61.98 63.28 B: mhm 

63.08 63.99 A: um 

64.35 70.26 A: i'm around kids all day and of course they catch everything 

71.05 72.03 A: so 

72.12 75.61 A: i catch a good portion of it um 

76.51 79.61 A: but yeah i see lots of people that 

80.25 81.52 A: that i work with 

82.00 83.32 A: who get sick 

84.07 86.91 A: you know once a season is how they put it 

87.53 92.22 A: um as far as going to the doctor versus not going to the doctor 

93.74 99.52 A: i don't especially for a cold i don't see that going to the doctor helps at all 

96.69 97.46 B: (( mm mm )) 

100.31 103.07 A: uh it certainly doesn't make you feel better 

102.28 109.52 B: [laughter] right mm mm mm mhm mhm right and i guess the other thing was the thing they was saying here is that of course i'm thinking about this season right now but i have a friend who 

109.78 124.74 B: when i was a kid i have my tonsils out but i have a friend who's from new england who never had his tonsils out he always seems to get sick right at the same time but it's more during the winter months and obviously [cough] it just seems like it because it keeps coming back every year not to blame everyone on the tonsils but 

119.04 120.04 A: yeah 

124.66 128.68 B: that uh you can't help thinking that's part of it you know same 

127.81 128.94 A: right 

128.90 131.21 B: type of illness every year so 

130.85 140.09 A: well and as i understand it part of it is that people are inside they're more closed up during certain parts of the year 

137.55 138.85 B: mhm 

139.81 140.81 B: right 

140.21 142.19 A: um which makes 

142.41 143.49 A: spreading 

143.76 146.06 A: the virus that much easier 

144.74 153.70 B: easier right exactly and i think the case of this guy you know with the um sars it's just that it's certainly being in an office and all those things just uh thinking 

147.06 148.28 A: yeah 

153.75 159.00 B: guess 'cause it's always sort of um a kind of eerie ear type infection that almost 

159.38 167.47 B: uh i have a lot of friends with kids who yeah they they get ear infections too but some for some of them at least getting their tonsils out is sort of clears that up but whatever 

167.53 171.79 B: so other than that i mean yeah i don't like i say have any 

167.58 168.68 A: yeah 

172.37 181.84 B: magic solution but at the same time i'm not myself haven't knock on wood haven't had that you know particular seasonal problem anyway 

181.01 182.18 A: yeah 

182.84 189.65 A: as far as from a cold i i do get colds but i guess i can't say that it's specifically from 

189.68 194.59 A: you know one each season i do know people who do get sick according to the season though 

194.28 195.63 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

194.96 195.89 A: um 

196.09 196.93 A: so 

197.44 210.33 B: and do you have know people that have allergies that sort of only kick in once a year or do they just have them all summer and take you know some medication for them or i know that's different maybe than colds but uh 

197.59 198.48 A: (( i'm not )) 

210.90 216.06 B: seasonal i don't know allergies do you know have friends that take things for allergies or 

215.39 221.37 A: oh definitely my husband um is he's allergic to alder 

221.28 222.28 B: (( mm )) 

221.61 227.33 A: and he can usually tell when alder trees are starting to open up because 

226.03 227.79 B: (( mm [laughter] )) 

227.77 229.87 A: he gets very sick 

229.51 230.43 B: wow 

230.43 237.87 A: every year and uh his eyes start itching you know and and he starts feeling congested 

231.48 232.33 B: (( mm mm )) 

237.91 240.87 A: and that's generally a sign so 

239.75 242.64 B: wow just that one tree only uh 

242.53 244.55 A: yeah as far as we can tell 

244.36 245.45 B: amazing 

245.57 246.45 A: yeah 

246.80 249.42 A: so do you know other people who 

249.53 251.17 A: allergies affect them 

250.56 257.26 B: yeah i guess they do yeah sort of mm they some people i know that have had allergies but i guess it's 

257.41 266.68 B: for them at least it's only once like in late spring or early i don't even know what it's you know to if it's grass it's pollen you know mould moss 

266.93 267.83 A: right 

267.41 270.96 B: whatever but it's just that they seem to i 

271.40 284.72 B: guess they now are taking some i'm not even sure what prescription or over the counter they take but they they manage to get it under control but i think that from childhood on you know it was obviously a drag because it there weren't all these new things 

285.11 291.56 B: to take and so they definitely suffered um just dragged along with it and uh 

291.76 297.19 B: they managed to find something recently but until then it wasn't very [laughter] you know it wasn't good 

296.17 297.26 A: yeah 

297.60 302.83 A: yeah i don't know um my husband generally doesn't take 

303.27 306.76 A: anything he doesn't care to take pills um 

305.68 307.14 B: mhm 

307.10 312.28 A: so i know he usually tries to to just deal with it but when he does 

310.40 311.41 B: right 

312.65 317.56 A: get real bad and and to the point he can't take it any more he does take um 

317.68 320.90 A: usually like allegra or something like that 

319.39 320.93 B: mhm 

320.99 323.94 A: and that seems to help right away so 

323.67 334.59 B: right and is that something that just like you said it's only this one tree and then it's or this one type of tree so that does that also mean it's only for a very specific time of year then it's 

334.38 336.57 A: it's a very specific time 

336.28 339.20 B: only when it blossoms or whatever and that's it mm 

338.82 340.00 A: yeah 

340.25 345.89 A: yeah and i don't even know if it's blossoming because i don't think that alder trees blossom 

345.19 346.76 B: ah right 

346.61 351.35 A: but um i do believe it's when the when the uh 

351.44 353.46 A: leaves are 

353.50 355.10 A: starting to come out 

355.71 359.41 A: that seems and it's always the same typ- the same time of year 

358.98 360.48 B: (( mhm )) 

360.05 363.03 A: and that's the only known allergy that he has 

362.66 363.70 B: (( mm right )) 

363.08 366.77 A: well besides cats but we don't have a cat so 

364.27 378.96 B: mm oh yeah [laughter] right so yeah and i have a lot of friends with cats that yeah obviously either they've managed to put up with their something but yeah for some people it's just so bad they can't uh they just can't have cats at all so 

366.83 367.87 A: [laughter] 

368.95 369.76 A: yeah 

378.52 380.51 A: yeah yeah 

380.63 384.95 B: but no dog no dog allergies or any other allergies 

385.46 388.23 A: not not in my family no 

387.18 389.02 B: right right 

388.48 389.40 A: no 

390.10 397.96 A: i know quite a few people who are allergic to dogs and you know it's i don't know what causes an allergy or what causes a cold 

397.97 399.61 A: but it seems like 

400.29 404.89 A: um like allergies seem to run in families and that kind of thing 

404.15 405.94 B: [laughter] mhm right 

405.64 406.59 A: um 

406.25 417.85 B: and i don't know a lot but i'm sure it does you know run it's sort of a genetic thing but it's also that i guess what i've heard is that at least for cats and dogs it's the dander it's the little flakes of skin but and then of course with 

417.90 423.86 B: grasses and poll- grasses and other plants it's supposedly the pollen or 

424.02 433.04 B: so there's just some microscopic thing that irritates um people in the [laughter] not the right way but they obviously have to have the right genetic makeup to 

432.58 434.05 A: right 

433.21 435.80 B: have this happen somehow so it's sort of 

435.20 436.39 A: right 

436.02 445.59 B: mysterious to me though i'm sure lots of new um research on [laughter] you know helping people who have them you know and uh what they can do about 

444.51 447.83 A: yeah how it can affect one person 

448.15 452.98 A: and not affect another is just intriguing 

452.58 460.54 B: mhm yeah i think it is too [laughter] but i'm just sort of glad in a way it hasn't you know whatever i haven't had that 

460.54 470.52 B: problem only because i think i'd be the grouchy type that you know wouldn't um just you know wouldn't want to be bothered with uh how to take more stuff whenever you know but 

467.06 468.18 A: yeah 

470.92 472.39 A: yeah 

470.93 478.65 B: but i don't and and that's the only seasonal thing i mean there's other people i know that just yeah like you said they might get a cold or flu the same time every year but 

478.81 479.96 B: um 

480.17 483.88 B: i think at least most of my friends that they get is 

484.35 492.78 B: the seasonal allergies and sometimes i don't know some people seem to outgrow them maybe when they get older i don't know if that's always true or not 

492.79 497.85 B: when i was a kid it seemed like some friends of ours had allergies that they grew out of or 

498.17 504.41 B: maybe they had asthma or something and i know a lot of people talk about asthma these days and for whatever reason 

504.47 508.58 B: it improved when they got older but you certainly can't rely on that 

508.76 513.36 A: yeah i i know that you can grow out of asthma because my daughter did 

511.83 512.82 B: mhm 

513.07 514.04 B: oh good 

513.44 519.83 A: um but i don't know if you can grow out of allergies i think 

518.75 520.12 B: (( mm mhm mm )) 

519.84 522.62 A: if you're allergic you're allergic 

521.78 523.10 B: (( [laughter] mm )) 

522.97 524.56 A: and um 

524.58 526.52 A: i grew into 

526.27 527.14 B: (( mm )) 

526.53 527.90 A: an allergy 

528.29 529.10 B: mhm 

528.41 532.06 A: but i don't know that anybody who's ever grown out of them 

532.73 533.43 B: (( mm )) 

535.44 540.09 B: and these are people you knew when you were younger or just that or when you were a kid or whenever 

535.55 536.52 A: so 

540.19 541.39 A: um who 

541.13 544.27 B: you you knew people that had grown out of this when you were 

544.31 548.00 B: growing up with them or when you were younger i meant i'm sorry when 

548.56 556.40 B: when you were younger you met or you knew people from childhood who grew out of these type of allergies or 

556.51 560.66 A: no no i don't know anybody who's ever grown out of an allergy 

559.56 564.82 B: or i meant to say asthma i apologize yeah i must i forgot that the asthma that you had said mhm 

563.16 564.22 A: right 

564.75 567.27 A: yeah my daughter grew out of asthma 

567.53 573.66 A: um she had it when she was newborn to the time she was about seven 

573.17 577.38 B: oh great well at least she was able to yeah get rid of it so to speak [laughter] 

576.43 577.91 A: yeah 

578.25 582.10 A: but i don't know anybody who's ever grown out of allergies 

581.52 582.90 B: mhm 

583.31 587.02 A: so i don't i don't know is it possible honestly 

586.75 590.89 B: yeah i don't know either but i guess it's just all anecdotal stuff that 

590.98 598.01 B: and i you know this was like for childhood friends so it's been a long time i certainly wouldn't pretend to know for sure 

598.26 599.78 B: (( but um ))
