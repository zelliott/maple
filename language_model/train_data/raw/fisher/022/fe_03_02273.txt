178.41 179.92 A: oh my goodness

195.09 196.13 B: (( um )) 

196.17 198.01 B: let me think wright city 

198.07 199.01 A: okay 

199.29 201.66 A: i've seen it on the map it says 

200.56 203.02 B: it's by st louis [laughter] 

202.36 203.69 A: okay 

203.86 204.72 B: it's a 

203.94 205.36 A: that's great 

204.88 209.62 B: i don't know what direction from there [laughter] i i could if i looked at a map 

208.77 210.60 A: (( around st louis somewhere )) 

210.14 211.88 B: yeah yeah 

210.78 211.70 A: okay 

212.01 213.56 A: quite a drive for me 

212.34 212.90 B: [sigh] 

213.29 218.44 B: yeah [laughter] me too [laughter] we went down for christmas so 

214.01 215.67 A: we're in kansas city 

218.44 220.19 A: oh that's nice 

219.57 223.98 B: um and the younger one she just went in um 

224.34 232.74 B: as a matter of fact when he called me they'd just got back from the emergency room with her i forget what it was with her too to tell you the truth [laughter] but there's [sigh] 

229.03 229.84 A: oh 

232.43 233.41 A: oh 

232.83 236.32 B: they seem to always be getting sick um 

237.31 243.29 B: i i didn't usually get sick from the ah seasons but my children did 

243.41 254.07 B: um once in a while i will you know but it's not like well i'm older too so when you're older you have more chronic illnesses than acute illnesses 

253.05 254.67 A: oh really 

254.33 255.27 B: yeah 

255.37 259.29 A: now i heard the strangest thing the other day that 

259.27 268.13 A: one of the theories in prevention magazine one of the theories about the allergies and things right now how they're so rampant 

267.98 278.39 A: is that um because so many people now are living in cities and landscaping their hybrid raising trees all of the male trees because they don't want 

278.40 283.15 A: um female trees drop it's either males or females 

282.14 283.34 B: the pollen 

283.35 294.42 A: drop um seeds so so people don't wanna clean up their yards so they're hydrating trees so that they don't aren't as messy so therefore there aren't the female and the male trees to 

283.93 286.18 B: or whatever right 

294.56 302.93 A: counterbalance one another so the p- the pollen they produce is just enormous and so so many more people are having pollen difficulties 

302.60 305.80 B: that that's possible another thing is 

305.81 308.90 B: actually we have it so much easier 

309.04 312.88 B: than our ancestors did okay so 

312.94 315.56 B: our immune systems aren't built up 

314.99 317.40 A: that's probably true as well 

316.85 321.67 B: you know i mean when our ancestors they had to get out and do things 

321.11 323.60 A: and we have recycled air and 

323.01 326.61 B: yeah we have everything we have everything like that 

324.15 325.67 A: right it's a 

326.10 334.06 A: if you have hay fever you can lock yourself in the ah house and turn on the air conditioner and stay out of the the outdoors 

333.46 337.41 B: right but see the thing is if you were out 

337.46 348.14 B: from a very young age where you had to be out my theory is is that you probably wouldn't have the allergies because your body would be used to it 

346.73 348.54 A: that may be true 

348.46 353.36 B: you know i mean it may may or may not i mean i'm sure some of it is hereditary 

352.96 356.87 A: but that that really makes sense because you think about all of our 

357.06 363.88 A: you know travelling in a covered wagon with all the dust around you you would have to become immune in order to survive 

361.16 362.42 B: right 

363.49 369.98 B: right exactly and not only that you know the work everybody was doing back then 

370.09 381.19 B: you know their bodies were stronger now there was a lot of disease but that was because they didn't have the medicines and stuff that for those particular ones 

370.85 373.28 A: made them stronger right 

378.11 379.09 A: right 

381.45 387.78 B: but if we had the medicines for those and we worked like we did then i don't think there'd be that much illness 

387.24 388.92 A: that's probably true 

388.80 389.76 B: you know 

389.41 394.29 A: d- how do you feel about going to the doctor do you run to the doctor or do you wait 

393.45 395.42 B: no i wait 

395.49 404.56 B: i do i really do i it's like it's not that i have a thing against doctors it's just that i don't wanna bother them if it's something i can deal with myself 

404.07 409.55 A: i agree and it seems like your choices are get an antibiotic 

409.62 418.03 A: or stay home [laughter] so what can they do if it's a virus you just go in there and pay your money for them to tell you get some rest [laughter] 

411.68 413.22 B: yeah and 

414.54 415.48 B: right 

417.85 425.36 B: and they also found that the antibiotics you can become immune to those too so then if you really need 'em 

423.07 424.18 A: right 

425.80 428.12 B: they're not gonna do any good 

426.66 432.26 A: right and my my two year old is already immune to two forms of antibiotics he's had 

432.47 436.03 A: i guess you would call him a chronically ill child he has been 

436.39 437.91 A: um he's 

437.95 441.79 A: he's twenty two months and he's been on twenty three antibiotics 

441.42 443.50 B: oh my goodness 

442.16 446.89 A: round the antibiotics so they've already found three that don't work for him anymore 

446.69 448.37 B: oh goodness [laughter] 

447.09 452.60 A: so we're getting ready to get his adenoids removed and and his ah 

452.73 459.61 A: sinuses blown out and and tubes put in his ears and then we're gonna try to stay off of all medication 

459.40 464.85 B: yeah so he he can build up now the tubes in his ears um 

459.85 461.12 A: after that 

465.32 468.76 B: i have a theory about that too but anyhow [laughter] 

467.77 468.89 A: do you 

468.85 470.37 B: yeah because 

469.51 472.71 A: i'm open to anything i don't know what to do with this child 

472.07 480.02 B: well see i i don't know because i don't know your child and i'm not a doctor okay but the thing that got me is back when my 

480.06 483.19 B: ah oldest son i have seven okay and 

482.73 483.74 A: (( [laughter] mm )) 

483.33 485.63 B: it's ah four girls three boys 

486.07 487.11 B: um 

486.23 488.80 A: oh wow [laughter] you were tired 

488.12 502.25 B: [laughter] yeah i didn't think about it then but i'll tell ya no actually i had a lotta help from the kids the older ones when they were little of course i did everything but when they were older and the younger ones were there they helped me tremendously 

491.79 492.58 A: [laughter] 

501.42 502.98 A: that's fabulous 

502.42 507.32 B: so i can't really say i did it all because they definitely helped me 

507.40 511.87 B: um but when he was about fifteen or sixteen 

511.89 521.00 B: okay there was the new rage of putting tubes in the ears okay well he had an ear infection and it was the second one in his whole life okay 

514.35 515.35 A: uh-huh 

521.06 523.52 B: (( i would not say that's whole lot )) 

523.02 524.48 A: i don't either 

524.19 527.18 B: well this doctor wanted to put tubes in his ears 

527.03 528.66 A: oh my gosh 

527.92 533.43 B: and i told him no way it was the new thing to be doing everybody had tubes in their ears 

533.53 538.01 B: and i says you're not touching my son [laughter] 

536.26 539.11 A: exactly after two infections 

538.54 549.71 B: yeah he said well he's had it too much and he just i don't think he even thought about that i would know what i'm talking about you know because here's a woman with seven kids she doesn't know nothing you know 

549.23 552.97 A: yeah [laughter] all of the respect we housewives get 

549.92 552.18 B: but ah [laughter] 

552.50 556.90 B: right [laughter] but a lot of times they just um 

553.18 554.84 A: [laughter] 

557.17 559.62 B: they do it and it's not necessary 

559.65 564.04 B: okay it sounds like your son might be different though 'cause he's sick a lot 

564.06 570.71 A: i'm i'm hoping it i don't know we have another e._n._t. appointment i've i'm getting my second opinion 

571.25 575.92 A: so we go again next week to a different e._n._t. to find out 

576.20 578.41 A: what he says but i figure 

578.53 580.53 A: [lipsmack] his pediatrician 

581.41 588.59 A: um has suggested this surgery and then we went to an allergist and now we've been to an e._n._t. and we're going to another e._n._t. 

587.88 593.21 B: yeah it sounds pretty much like he might need it does he get a lot of ear infections 

590.38 591.99 A: so [sigh] 

592.60 593.92 A: yes 

593.47 595.12 B: okay that would be 

595.13 599.89 A: a lot of ear infections a lot of sinus infections and respiratory infections 

597.98 599.95 B: oh okay yeah
