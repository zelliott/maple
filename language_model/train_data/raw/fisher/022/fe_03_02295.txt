21.23 27.87 B: so how does it work we basically chat for like another minute and we have eight minutes to talk about this thing or 

27.43 31.24 A: yeah we're we're supposed to talk about the topic of the day 

30.62 31.78 B: okay 

31.69 33.24 A: so illness 

32.66 33.74 B: all right 

33.74 38.27 A: um well i'll tell you what what i've done to try to stay better and um 

37.59 39.02 B: o- okay 

39.10 40.76 A: the atkins diet 

41.01 44.26 B: oh now tell me about that how does that work 

42.89 46.13 A: okay it it it's pretty much a low carb thing 

45.63 46.56 B: okay 

46.36 47.29 A: now 

47.91 54.80 A: um i'm thirty five and since i was thirteen i've had problems with insomnia and i i don't like to take pharmaceuticals 

51.84 53.38 B: oh really okay 

54.24 55.45 B: mhm 

54.84 58.51 A: i've tried meditation exercise i've tried taking mild 

58.53 66.77 A: you know things that make me sleep or whatever i i have a little bit of wacky blood sugar but nothing that i have to be on a controlled diet for or anything like that 

62.75 63.77 B: okay 

66.28 67.18 B: uh-huh 

66.96 73.92 A: i started doing this just you know to feel healthy i heard it give you energy it took rid it got rid of my insomnia 

73.61 75.24 B: mhm well hey that's amazing 

74.63 78.58 A: i have like more energy during the day than you can imagine and 

77.98 82.23 B: right see that's fascinating because i'm i tend not 

82.66 90.61 B: stop eating carbohydrates i'm a carbohydrate complete addict it's just like i was just thinking about that as i as as i was walking home today 

87.35 88.15 A: oh 

90.61 98.23 B: because the bulk of what i eat is carbohydrates and i wonder i mean i'm twenty four why at the end of the work day i feel like i have to come home and have a nap 

97.90 99.18 A: oh yeah 

98.59 107.57 B: you know and i'm thinking i'm twenty four i'm healthy there's no reason why i should feel like i need to have a nap at the end of my work day because it really wasn't that you know 

107.33 108.60 A: yeah 

107.97 111.65 B: and that's probably why 'cause i'm just not giving myself the right fuel 

110.85 113.21 A: oh yeah but you know because i 

113.34 116.25 A: i don't have the mid afternoon fatigue 

115.96 117.95 B: now do you crave carbohydrates 

117.56 121.85 A: oh man the first week i wanted a bowl of pasta and a side of french fries 

119.86 121.29 B: [laughter] 

121.78 127.15 B: so do they allow you any i mean can you have a piece of toast ever or is it just really like totally gone 

126.05 129.18 A: oh yeah it it's just kinda like you start off 

129.29 144.29 A: and and a lot of it is dependent on whether or not you want to lose weight you know i have my three to five pounds that i gained over christmas because of all the treats and goodies but i don't like need to lose a lot of weight but i was doing it more because i heard that people who do it feel so good 

135.09 136.02 B: mhm 

137.00 137.85 B: sure 

143.68 145.13 B: (( great all right )) 

144.94 150.29 A: you know and and yeah i lost a little bit of weight you know my three to five pounds or whatever 

147.86 148.72 B: mhm 

150.59 157.33 A: um and then you gradually start building up your carbs but yeah and also it it just depends on what you're eating 

157.26 158.54 B: yeah that 

157.71 160.76 A: like if you stay away from starch that's your big thing 

160.36 161.46 B: sure 

161.04 165.76 A: your potatoes pasta rice which is pretty much all i've ever eaten um 

164.79 172.56 B: ye- yeah 'cause i'm afraid i'd stop eating the potatoes and starch and just replace it with like ice cream and [laughter] just something worse you know [laughter] 

171.79 175.01 A: but you know eating a big fat rib eye doesn't suck 

175.01 179.49 B: yeah i ca- i can imagine having some nice like red wine sauce on it or something yeah 

178.62 186.13 A: oh yeah yeah you know and you like oh don't drink beer but have wine and alcohol i'm like well you know i think i can switch to that 

182.68 184.40 B: [laughter] 

185.44 187.32 B: (( yeah doesn't sound so bad )) 

186.20 188.94 A: i'll have a martini instead of a beer 

188.46 189.99 B: yeah no kidding 

189.56 200.17 A: but you know just all these other side things that i didn't really expect you know it wasn't my purpose but here i've had insomnia for years and i sleep like a baby 

199.48 206.53 B: wow now does the atkins diet like proclaim to help insomnia is it just that you found it was hell better 

204.05 204.91 A: no 

205.95 211.28 A: maybe it was my blood sugar that gave me insomnia i don't it it's a total fluke but 

207.24 208.76 B: wow 

210.87 212.28 B: that's wonderful 

211.61 217.34 A: on top of having more energy i actually have gone two weeks without insomnia which for me is a record so 

216.50 218.67 B: i know wow that's wonderful 

218.06 221.70 A: you know the health benefits are are really pretty cool 

221.38 229.48 B: (( yeah well maybe this is a blessing in disguise that i found an ad for this [laughter] damage i'll have to try the atkins diet who knows )) 

222.25 223.91 A: but you know 

226.61 227.51 A: well 

228.59 234.68 A: i'm i'm a health freak anyway you know i think that if you take care of yourself you know it's so much better for you 

230.35 231.37 B: yeah 

234.64 236.88 B: yeah 

234.71 235.49 A: but 

235.82 241.02 A: you know i i try to eat healthy eat soy you know and do all the right things mhm 

239.14 249.39 B: good yeah 'cause i think i mean jus- just like speaking about illness i think so many people wonder just on a global scale especially western 

249.48 258.96 B: how come i feel sick how come i don't have energy how come i have these symptoms of whatever but it's like the things that we put in our body are 

254.65 255.69 A: oh yeah 

258.26 259.22 A: oh 

259.02 265.06 B: astonishing and the level of processing i mean i'm i'm the worst i mean i'll have like these um 

265.42 268.74 B: what you call those like instant japanese noodles i mean they're like 

267.61 278.73 A: oh oh ramen noodles and i don't i couldn't if i had a dollar for every box of macaroni and cheese i've ever eaten in my life or other you know hamburger helper or other processed 

269.23 270.35 B: (( i don't like )) 

272.85 275.04 B: [laughter] 

276.49 277.51 B: (( yeah )) 

278.10 284.15 B: but it's like the i i work every morning at the cattering cancer center and um 

283.71 285.09 A: oh wow cool 

284.65 289.99 B: yeah it's um i don't i'm not actually involved in cancer research per se but 

290.11 292.76 B: it's just interesting because um 

291.86 297.67 A: i bet you get a lot of just information about nutrition as far as like how to avoid cancer 

294.59 296.83 B: oh absolutely 

297.14 299.00 B: well definitely and i mean 

299.29 308.95 B: the rates of cancer have skyrocketed and you know for all the advances we've made in medicine i mean i mean there are some diseases that have been around okay but i mean people are getting sicker 

308.49 315.43 A: but um well i mean look at americans overall we eat crap we lead a high stress life you know we're 

311.96 313.09 B: yeah [laughter] 

314.08 315.47 B: mhm 

315.64 316.37 A: we're 

316.80 326.23 A: obsessive compulsive workaholics but like i i'd sit around and i'd look at people who are like french or japanese who like culturally smoke like fiends 

318.93 320.18 B: (( yeah and )) 

323.02 323.92 B: mhm 

325.69 326.86 B: yeah 

326.30 328.51 A: and they [laughter] they have like lung 

328.70 330.28 A: lung cancer of course 

329.57 332.16 B: yeah it's really weird isn't it 

330.36 331.75 A: they're not smoking 

331.93 345.52 A: you know these horrible cigarettes with all the additives that that are put in here but i would sit around and wonder i'm like how can these people living in the ukraine who just sit there and eat sausage and smoke cigarettes live so yeah 

334.88 336.07 B: yeah 

341.99 344.74 B: yeah and sauerkraut and 

345.44 346.56 B: so true 

346.10 349.91 A: i think the low stress like lifestyle thing is important too i think 

348.92 363.62 B: yeah well it reminds me of this thing that the phone system said of like your cold's gonna last a day whether you go to a doctor or not because i mean i don't i mean a cold is a virus and the doctors love to prescribe antibac- um sorry antibiotics which 

354.59 355.72 A: yeah 

362.63 363.96 A: mhm 

363.51 364.69 B: are useless 

364.22 366.28 A: that just helps for bacteria doesn't 

365.59 379.95 B: absolutely and you mu- i i mean i suppose you might get a secondary bacterial infection i i guess but the real thing is that the antivacs do nothing for the virus and so all you do is you feel better that you've gone along to the doctor and like you he's saw you for five minutes and 

377.64 382.20 A: it but you're just building up your resistance to antibiotics really 

380.11 381.42 B: yeah and he gives you 

381.78 387.80 B: absolutely and then it's just that you get you know you're more prone to yeast infections urinary tract infections etcetera 

387.74 398.78 B: and um but it's just like i guess people feel like they need to go because they need to be sort of a bit proactive in fighting the cold but i mean it it's a they're not ready to do the things that would actually improve their lifestyle you know it takes a 

387.86 388.89 A: yeah 

393.50 394.84 A: you know i think that it 

398.60 403.60 A: oh yeah i i have a lot of friends who are like into so much holistic stuff like 

399.16 400.25 B: yeah 

402.75 403.67 B: uh-huh 

403.63 404.78 A: i remember 

404.94 411.10 A: um i'm from the north and i moved to nashville and started having like not really bad but just like seasonal allergy 

410.61 411.47 B: uh-huh 

411.28 414.28 A: and a friend of mine was like take a cayenne pepper tablet 

413.90 417.67 B: really because i have allergies right now they're killing me 

414.54 415.70 A: (( it worked )) 

416.43 420.48 A: and i'm i'm sitting here going i hate benadryl because i feel speedy 

420.02 421.26 B: uh-huh

434.56 435.51 B: wow 

435.12 442.66 A: and it yeah i got rid of it it it would only last a couple hours it wasn't like twelve hour pain relief but i also knew i wasn't like 

440.65 441.54 B: mhm 

442.87 447.30 A: take any a natural crap and i didn't get you know the speedy 

445.84 456.57 B: yeah yeah well that's really interesting i wonder if i should just include more of it in my diet just i mean aside from actually having the pill quite yet just like putting it on my food or something 

447.51 448.40 A: feeling 

452.38 453.26 A: yeah 

454.92 456.27 A: oh no yeah but 

456.29 461.86 A: yeah like nothing's better than a cold than like thai food more like getting hot

470.11 471.41 B: yeah 

473.60 477.34 B: oh interesting great and and and how do you like it there it's a good place to live 

476.82 477.82 A: (( uh )) 

478.40 480.65 A: it's a very complacent place to live 

480.09 481.08 B: okay 

480.70 488.07 A: the because it's so comfortable the cost of living's low the crime is low the traffic isn't bad the climate's not bad 

488.19 489.01 A: but 

489.15 491.45 A: when it comes to like the arts or 

491.80 492.72 A: um 

492.95 495.76 A: intellectual conversation with people you know it 

494.99 496.20 B: [laughter] 

495.85 498.28 A: goes to the wayside [laughter] 

497.66 504.14 B: yeah well that's the the best thing about new york i suppose is you there's never a dull moment and there's always somebody to 

504.40 506.88 A: do you do you like living are you from the city 

506.36 513.51 B: no i'm from a small town in western canada and i don't like most of new york i mean like i could go on forever but i 

509.21 511.26 A: oh no kidding how cool 

513.56 518.13 B: the um the amazing parts like the museums and i love music i go to the jazz 

517.16 519.00 A: i love moma 

518.56 519.72 B: it's amazing 

519.98 531.13 B: absolutely wonderful stuff but you have to get through a lot of crap to to get there you have to be able to have the time and afford it which most people can't do they move here and they find themselves like me just 

525.23 526.09 A: (( see mhm )) 

531.64 535.10 B: living in a small apartment and going on the subway and just sort of 

535.12 538.23 B: time passes and you think like what am i doing here and i go 

538.05 541.84 A: see i don't miss the stress of living back in chicago 

541.51 554.21 B: yeah i mean it takes a lot of energy like just think of grocery shopping you got to walk up the flights of stairs in your apartment then you gotta and and like no one has a car of course so you you spend hours and you came home and you feel exhausted like all you did was go grocery shopping 

541.98 542.88 A: i mean 

546.03 547.03 A: (( oh yeah )) 

553.50 557.02 A: well like i have something now that i couldn't have before a dog yeah 

556.44 561.46 B: [laughter] yes see i miss my animals see i've always had a dog and a cat it's 

561.48 568.52 B: and the people that keep pets here i think are very annoying because these poor animals are living in these tiny little apartments 

567.52 569.03 A: that's see that's not right 

568.88 570.22 B: and it's like 

569.85 575.54 A: you know and animals are supposed to be like a stress reducer but when you got to go down twelve flights 

572.47 573.40 B: yeah 

574.91 577.95 B: yeah and when you got to hire someone to walk your dog 

577.29 581.43 A: and the poor dogs never get to play on grass [laughter] i mean that's just wrong 

579.34 586.69 B: yeah i know like walking around on cement man i wouldn't want to be a dog in new york especially like it's very trendy to have a big dog like a dalmatian or a 

586.45 591.15 A: well i know this guy from new york he was down here for some work thing 

590.80 591.98 B: mhm 

591.33 599.89 A: and he owned a a great dane and i'm thinking one how can you afford an apartment big enough for a dane and god help you if you don't and what 

596.11 597.75 B: (( yeah no kidding )) 

598.71 599.95 B: yeah
