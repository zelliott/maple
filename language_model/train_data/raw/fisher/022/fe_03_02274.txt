113.46 114.83 B: yeah 

114.41 119.04 A: now i don't know if it has anything to do with the mild weather here in sacramento

117.03 118.21 B: well you 

118.37 132.84 B: you're very lucky to live in sacramento california i would give anything to live outside of new york i mean i love new york it's just it's just so much has happened to our city recently i mean with everything and the weather was terrible and um 

121.05 122.95 A: yeah yeah 

125.02 126.33 A: sure 

129.77 130.77 A: oh 

131.51 134.21 A: i know i know i saw it on t._v. it you know 

133.35 144.44 B: oh it's so ter- it thoroughly dep- there were many depressed people oh so we can't get off the subject so anyway back to depression [laughter] because we have to talk about the the other thing um 

134.35 135.57 A: i was uh 

135.92 138.47 A: snow and like oh sure 

139.21 141.83 A: (( right right well yeah )) 

143.49 147.83 A: well talking about depression don't you think depression makes you sick 

144.82 146.02 B: yes 

147.44 149.83 B: depression actually makes one sick 

149.17 159.13 A: oh yeah i agree especially when you're stuck in the house i remember back in iowa we we would we called it cabin fever and we couldn't get out for days 

149.97 151.55 B: (( always )) 

155.76 156.73 B: yeah 

158.44 159.94 B: really 

159.24 162.56 A: and you know it does it makes you really depressed and then 

161.57 174.29 B: very depressed i know well there are people i know who are affected by the sunlight i'm sure you've heard of it where they go under certain lamps um to you know bring back the um type of intensity that the sun would have normally 

162.68 164.36 A: (( yeah and so )) 

169.02 170.87 A: (( mhm )) 

173.80 176.50 A: sure sure that's a good idea 

174.46 179.52 B: yeah 'cause you know it g- gets dark here at four thirty in the winter imagine 

179.27 180.19 A: (( yeah )) 

179.49 192.10 B: so um okay i i think that we covered that now i remember the next one was didn't they ask about the funny saying a cold lasts seven days if you go to the doctor or a week if you don't 

182.60 185.10 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

189.43 190.64 A: yes 

191.46 193.58 A: yeah i i believe that's true 

193.07 195.90 B: i believe it's true [laughter] 

194.32 204.94 A: because um it's been a couple of years since i had a real real bad cold but [sigh] it it lasted a good seven days in fact i think it lasted the cough lasted for like a month 

202.27 203.29 B: right 

204.29 206.40 B: oh the cough is terrible 

205.66 208.87 A: that just hangs in there it won't go away will it 

208.17 222.08 B: no and the funny thing is when they say going to the doctor a week versus not going to the doctor seven days meaning that really a doctor can't treat a cold and whatever you do by yourself at home you just have to let it run its course right 

212.90 213.46 A: (( yeah )) 

214.51 215.23 A: (( uh-huh )) 

221.17 230.76 A: i i agree i think you just gotta let it go because [sigh] i've been to the doctor before for a bad cold and there's absolutely nothing they can do for you they can't give you antibiotics 

222.16 223.35 B: yeah 

223.71 224.90 B: definitely 

229.89 232.26 B: (( no not at all )) 

230.83 232.98 A: no they just tell you to 

232.68 234.31 B: i know because 

233.32 240.27 A: now i he did give me some cough medicine so that had that did help but that's about all i was able to get but 

236.56 238.83 B: oh well that's good that's good [mn] 

240.28 246.11 A: fortunately i didn't you know get a real bad cold this year so i'm yeah i'm really happy 

243.52 253.22 B: that's great i remember when i used when i used to smoke cigarettes um you know my cough would last forever but i'm so glad i have stopped did you ever smoke 

249.84 251.46 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

252.81 261.72 A: i used to smoke when i was in high school and 'til i got pregnant and then when i got pregnant it made me sick so i quit [laughter] yeah so 

254.79 255.79 B: [sigh] 

256.59 257.36 B: (( ah )) 

258.98 263.00 B: very good oh so you're a married lady with children

292.97 293.89 B: and 

292.98 299.35 A: that's what made me think of it when you said that about smoking he smokes and he seems to be sicker

299.59 306.40 A: you know when cau- because he smokes like if he gets a bad cold it seems to hang in there a lot longer for him

468.20 469.86 A: oh what business 

469.03 474.89 B: the insurance business that's why they hooked up isn't that strange 

470.58 476.43 A: [laughter] well i think it's just quite a coincidence huh 

475.07 478.66 B: and that you called in the same time as i called in

478.97 480.99 B: ooh oooh 

481.29 491.49 B: we're the sa- this is what i do i'm an underwriter personal loans and i'm claims manager i handle all the claims i work for a brokerage agency 

481.94 483.06 A: (( and uh )) 

484.89 487.29 A: (( oh how exciting )) 

487.91 489.01 A: wonderful 

490.63 502.05 A: hey sounds like an interesting job yeah well we probably should get back on the subject what i was gonna say is do you think as you've gotten older you get sick easier or 

492.53 495.20 B: (( [laughter] i tell you [laughter] )) 

497.37 498.10 B: yeah 

502.03 512.93 B: [lipsmack] well yes absolutely because um people also as they get older they get weaker and they get um i think depressed [laughter] right 

502.44 503.25 A: or 

508.63 509.80 A: mhm 

510.86 520.75 A: that's true that's true the only difference i see is i used to get sick a lot when the kids were still at home because they bring everything home from school 

517.58 518.56 B: yeah 

520.33 521.85 B: true 

520.92 529.25 A: and so whenever they had colds i had a cold so it seems like i don't get sick as much as i'm getting older but you know i still 

526.86 528.47 B: (( i know )) 

529.01 530.33 B: [mn] and you know 

529.32 533.80 A: everybody still gets the bad cold when it's the weather change i usually get it 

531.01 532.03 B: (( of course )) 

533.69 547.86 A: when we switch from the air condition- or from the [sigh] when when we start the air conditioners in the summer i usually that's 'cause you're in and out of hot and cold and hot and cold and i think that i think that brings it on don't you 

535.51 536.49 B: yeah 

538.71 540.87 B: right right 

543.87 546.27 B: oh right definitely 

547.38 560.53 B: oh sure and even you know it's funny that i've read things where people who um get cancer [cough] they can't sometimes you know they blame stress and they blame depression and um they might be right 

548.26 549.34 A: yeah 

549.48 552.53 A: (( mhm )) 

553.68 554.60 A: (( mhm )) 

560.14 566.87 A: yeah oh i agree i agree i've been reading about diabetes and it's a lot of it is caused by stress 

561.43 562.42 B: (( you know )) 

566.64 567.86 B: true 

567.55 573.13 A: because my blood sugar's been kinda high lately and and so my doctor's keeping an eye on me 

570.12 571.55 B: oh boy 

573.18 583.19 A: so i've been reading about it and they said if you have a stressful job in life it can it can make your blood sugar go up so i i i truly believe 

573.21 574.07 B: oh 

577.14 577.95 B: right 

578.03 578.82 B: yeah 

582.78 583.83 B: yeah 

583.21 592.93 A: that your lifestyle has a lot to do with with you getting sick you know we need to slow down and relax and stay home and you know 

584.67 586.48 B: absolutely 

586.90 588.75 B: (( of course of course )) 

592.52 594.53 B: just enjoy life 

593.59 599.45 A: [laughter] enjoy life yeah and then maybe we you know if i think if you're happy you don't get as sick 

594.87 596.12 B: i know 

597.87 598.71 B: yeah 

598.97 599.89 B: definitely
