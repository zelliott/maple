160.55 161.76 A: really 

161.23 163.65 B: or flu oh yeah

270.74 274.27 A: [laughter] [laughter] a friend of mine actually um 

274.48 276.36 A: said she's been taking pignogenol 

276.43 281.75 A: she hasn't gotten sick at all and and her attention span has gotten a lot ah sharper

283.00 283.75 A: she 

286.29 287.38 A: really 

287.56 289.19 B: yeah now ah 

289.98 294.51 B: grape seed extract [sigh] pignogenol comes from a um 

294.58 298.09 B: if i remember it comes from pine bark 

298.46 299.40 A: really 

299.08 308.90 B: and ah grape seed extract of course from obviously from gra- extract of grape seeds and there's differences of opinion as to which one is really better 

304.96 306.15 A: [laughter] 

309.15 314.05 B: um but in case of doubt take both of 'em or something [laughter] 

313.74 316.58 A: you never know you never know what's gonna help 

316.33 318.39 B: yeah and you know one of the things 

317.51 320.69 A: i actually don't get ill very often um i 

320.80 323.19 A: i got really sick last year um 

323.91 327.43 A: er i'll even i'll go to work with a cold i'll go to work sick 

327.16 328.42 B: yeah 

327.77 329.95 A: and i don't really care i can usually shake it off 

329.76 330.68 B: uh-huh 

330.06 335.71 A: but this particular cold like i was on the couch for a week that doesn't happen to me 

335.99 337.13 B: right 

337.07 338.27 A: so that's ah 

337.92 339.83 B: that's happening more and more often 

338.78 342.22 A: actually i'm feeling like i've been sick in the last five years come to think of it 

342.02 343.32 B: yeah 

342.75 344.89 A: like knock me on my ass kinda sick 

344.50 350.25 B: yeah well this you know how ah the viruses mutate 

350.40 352.09 A: yeah from person to person 

351.51 358.36 B: like the fl- flu virus can mutate that's why they have to have a different combination each year for flu shots 

353.04 353.96 A: yeah 

358.62 359.56 A: yeah 

359.30 363.23 B: and so i imagine cold viruses maybe do the same thing 

363.15 364.31 A: i would imagine 

363.50 367.20 B: and so some of 'em are probably more potent than others but ah 

367.70 369.65 B: yeah next time you 

368.88 376.14 A: i try a little of that theraflu and i do a lot of tea and um i try to take my vitamins every day but sometimes i don't succeed
