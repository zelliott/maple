0.58 2.26 B: hi this is crystal 

1.91 4.33 A: hi crystal this is ralph how are you 

3.92 5.32 B: oh good how are you 

4.97 6.17 A: (( good )) 

5.53 6.51 B: good 

6.79 12.96 B: um so i guess we're supposed to be speaking on the topic of illness and what was the last thing she said about the seven days 

9.70 10.77 A: that's right i 

13.06 18.07 A: i was i i was hoping you'd caught the whole thing it sounded to me like she was talking about ah 

18.51 21.68 A: if you're ill for more than seven days you go to the hospital 

21.32 24.07 B: oh okay all right okay that makes sense 

24.17 27.53 B: um i guess you could go ahead and start if if you get 

27.94 30.81 B: if you get sick during the season change and then i'll go 

31.37 32.60 A: (( okay ah )) 

33.44 36.83 A: i don't really notice it too much ah i live in florida 

37.48 42.03 A: so we don't we don't get the drastic changes that some people do 

41.67 53.77 B: after that oh oh yeah wow yeah florida is warm washington state so we actually do get the seasonal um stuff that's going around it's kinda damp uh where i'm in w- western washington 

43.28 44.78 A: where are you from 

46.00 46.84 A: oh it's 

53.90 67.39 B: so it's kinda damp and um we get the flu season that goes around and couple years ago our family and we had a little one year old at the time we got the the flu that was going around there was respiratory high fever 

67.35 78.50 B: it was really bad [laughter] it was just kinda knocked us all i think we spent i don't know two to four hundred dollars going to the doctor and that's after insurance and everything so it can get really bad 

78.70 89.66 B: over here we just we had to go get antibiotics and it was just you know it seems like the flu season is like february march is the worst when when we get it 

89.97 95.23 A: yeah we ah well you know we obviously get sick down here in florida it may not be so much 

95.40 103.29 A: you know climate related but you know we have flu bugs that come through and with a much older population than probably the state of washington 

103.37 107.11 A: yeah we seem to notice more sick people in florida 

106.84 110.11 B: oh yeah that's true 

110.48 111.96 B: yeah um oh 

111.14 114.16 A: i i think a lot more than of them tend to ah 

114.24 115.72 A: go to the hospital 

116.29 119.84 A: maybe sooner than than you or i would 

119.22 125.61 B: yeah yeah we don't really go to the hospital too much we usually tend to go to the doctor first and then 

125.63 130.27 B: if it's really bad then well it's not really the hospital too much 

130.67 138.99 A: i guess it depends on what kind of insurance some you know when the older folks have medicare and such that maybe they have a little better coverage than we do [laughter] 

138.52 140.81 B: (( yeah right that's true it's ah )) 

140.97 147.25 B: it's a factor and if whether you have insurance coverage we have insurance but it didn't seem to um 

147.43 149.48 B: i don't know they weren't covering it 

149.45 154.37 B: ah ah some of it so that's why we end up paying so much but it just seems like once 

154.31 164.86 B: you know february hits it's like it's flu season everybody knows it [laughter] but year this year it wasn't the respiratory flu it's more like the the stomach flu that was going round so 

164.04 166.14 A: oh even worse [laughter] 

165.31 175.70 B: yeah that that can be really bad so we kinda dodge we try to dodge people you know who are sick if we know someone's sick we go oh no we're not coming [laughter] so 

170.45 171.31 A: yeah 

174.94 183.37 A: i think people notice allergies down here i don't think that qualifies as a sickness i've never heard of anyone go to the emergency room for an allergy attack but 

183.65 187.93 B: oh what kinda allergy attacks just like um just 

187.31 188.79 A: well we have ah 

189.97 194.91 A: you know the mold spores down here because of the dampness you may experience that up where you are too 

194.69 196.01 B: yeah 

195.16 198.72 A: you know some people are just allergic to mold others are 

199.10 200.97 A: ah obviously the pollen we 

201.02 203.05 A: certain times of the year you know 

203.35 208.73 A: we don't have a really identifiable you know four seasons they just kinda flow back and forth 

208.52 210.91 B: mm yeah really warm down there then 

211.33 213.53 A: well most of the time ah [cough] 

213.70 216.46 A: you know we get nervous if it ever hits forty 

216.45 220.45 B: oh [laughter] yeah i can imagine i i can see what you 

219.90 221.51 A: today is eighty two 

221.46 222.74 B: oh wow 

222.89 224.53 B: that's nice i don't 

224.68 228.56 B: i don't know we don't usually get really warm weather in usually in 

228.59 243.11 B: june or july it's well july is when we get the warm weather so basically the sickness is like gone by july we just we have that those few months before like the you know february march april lots of cold it 

243.14 244.50 B: it starts they 

244.52 247.10 B: a- a- say we can get flu shots like in 

247.36 250.52 B: i they usually try to give us all flu shots in october 

250.91 256.03 B: so i don't know if they give a lot of flu shots down there since you don't have a lot of sickness then 

255.43 261.62 A: well they have the the flu shots they give them primarily for the elderly because they're the most vulnerable to you know 

261.55 262.62 B: right 

262.18 270.26 A: the the slightest thing that you know something that you know we may laugh off in a day it may you know be a death you know life threatening for someone who's in their eighties 

270.06 271.58 B: yeah that's true 

271.77 276.30 B: do they g- give it to infants and babies too or is it just basically the elderly 

276.00 278.11 A: i think it's it's the elderly 

278.35 282.72 A: it's available for other people but ah you know they you know some 

282.98 287.45 A: sometimes they just put on a push and if you're over sixty five they give it to you for free 

287.66 289.37 B: oh okay 

289.51 291.49 B: what does the state do that or 

292.69 296.57 A: it's probably somehow cook you know hooked up with medicare and the state 

296.07 297.15 B: (( oh okay )) 

297.95 299.16 B: yeah 

299.52 300.87 B: (( mm well )) 

301.39 303.81 B: yeah we just we don't really 

303.87 314.33 B: but ah they don't really give it to people who are like middle aged i guess i'd be classified as you know middle aged but it's mostly for infants and and the elderly um 

314.90 318.55 A: and i try to avoid shots whenever possible [laughter] 

316.97 318.87 B: yeah [laughter] yes 

319.05 320.39 B: (( oh man )) 

320.61 324.99 B: yeah shots for little kids aren't exactly fun either [laughter] 

324.90 326.52 A: oh do you have a bunch of 'em [laughter] 

326.51 328.84 B: yeah we have three little kids so 

327.82 329.82 A: oh that that's enough [laughter] 

329.30 337.65 B: yeah so but they're they're pretty healthy they don't get too sick too often it's basically just colds and stuff do you do you yourself get sick a lot or 

337.72 345.39 A: no i don't ah i'm in my mid fifties so i you know i'm kind of in the middle down here in florida i'm not quite you know ready for the 

345.76 349.46 A: the hospital but you know [laughter] not exactly young either but 

347.60 348.66 B: yeah 

349.53 351.00 A: no i don't find ah 

351.07 354.56 A: you know people that i know in my age group seem to be pretty healthy 

354.79 364.71 B: oh yeah well ah then you're kind of past the point where 'cause i know that colds if you get a certain there's like six hundred different kinds of cold i think and if once you get one cold 

364.80 375.42 B: you can't get it for the rest of your life 'cause of the antibodies so i just i know that once you're you know older than twenty five or so you've basically had all the colds when you were kids 

374.94 377.99 A: yeah let's hope i got rid of [laughter] you know of all that you know 

377.33 378.59 B: yeah 

378.29 381.58 A: number five ninety nine isn't waiting for me [laughter] 

380.89 384.80 B: [laughter] so it's kinda nice to to be over that 

384.87 389.06 B: but with little kids it's like you pick up everything that's around so [sigh] 

389.39 391.05 B: so anyway we just 

389.99 402.29 A: i guess yeah schools and ah airplanes were big i think every time i go on a plane i wind up coming off with some kind of a cold because you're you're essentially when you're on a plane you're breathing everybody else's air too 

397.81 398.78 B: yeah 

401.94 405.97 B: yes and isn't the ventilation is it not that good 

404.68 406.95 A: it it it's not that good 

406.29 417.49 B: yeah yeah like i can't imagine i wonder to take a survey of a bunch of people who just got the get gets off a plane and discover how many people [laughter] ah got the person that was sick 

417.72 419.12 B: whatever they had 

420.07 421.77 B: got this illness 

421.63 424.96 A: yeah well that's a big concern with what is it sars 

424.89 426.67 B: oh yes 

426.71 427.84 B: yep 

427.98 432.01 B: that that would be a a that's a big thing um i don't know even 

432.21 441.59 B: avoiding the airport it's not very practical but i've heard that um they're doing a lot of precautions for that especially you know over where it started 

442.03 447.20 A: well you know it's ah in i guess i have quite a bit in well by comparison to us 

447.65 449.93 A: quite a bit in canada and toronto 

449.80 451.58 B: yeah 

451.67 452.49 B: hmm 

451.78 456.92 A: and we have a large population of people from canada come down here for the winter 

456.99 460.30 A: i'm on the west coast of florida that seems to attract 'em 

459.93 462.24 B: oh okay yeah 

461.24 470.72 A: so it's a you know it it's a topic of conversation more down here perhaps than it is in you know kentucky [laughter] where there aren't any cases we got about fourteen or fifteen cases 

466.77 468.42 B: right exactly 

471.03 474.06 B: oh in in the in the united states or in the state 

472.87 475.07 A: er in in florida 

474.55 485.05 B: oh you do wow that is a lot because i know in washington i don't think they [sigh] i think they had seven at one point and i think they're stabilized and it's not spread also so 

475.45 476.28 A: yeah 

480.45 481.54 A: mhm 

485.29 487.40 B: it's not spreading any more i don't know 

487.98 492.61 B: i know that i have heard in toronto though it's get it's pretty bad 

492.82 505.31 B: but that that's too bad but i've i also heard i think it was this morning on the news that it was starting to [sigh] um not spread i think they're starting to get over it and it's contained or something so that would be good 

505.35 510.00 A: yeah i i guess i you know i i'd rather be in toronto than peking [laughter] 

509.50 510.83 B: (( [laughter] that's true )) 

510.86 513.25 B: yeah if you had an option of the two places 

513.67 514.71 B: oh 

514.98 519.07 B: but generally i guess it's not that much percentage only it's because we've 

519.08 519.96 B: (( you know )) 

520.18 526.24 A: well i think we're so conscious of ah of anything to do with diseases that we're not quite sure where they came from 

525.68 529.32 B: right exactly and it if it's hard to prevent 

529.59 532.53 B: then it's kinda tricky i know some ill illnesses 

532.54 534.52 B: you have incubation period 

534.56 536.06 B: um is 

536.31 548.98 B: you basically you can give someone something even before you get sick like i know the chicken pox we went through that and you can give the person the chicken pox before you actually get it so it's you know whether sars is something like that it's it's some things are just really hard to contain 

541.57 542.36 A: yeah 

549.01 551.54 A: yeah that's true if there's no visible sign 

551.33 552.35 B: right 

551.72 558.64 A: and all they can do now is say you know [cough] where have you been because i know down here they're [cough] you know the cruise ships 

558.86 563.34 A: are screening passengers and they're a little reluctant to let anybody on the ships 

563.60 566.23 A: that have travelled in ah the far east 

566.27 569.07 A: or in or in toronto very recently 

566.31 567.65 B: oh 

569.07 570.48 B: right 

570.68 575.45 B: so what do they do to screen it just ah wear masks and stuff and give everyone a thermometer [laughter] 

575.26 583.23 A: no i i think you know they they're i think they're relying on people telling the truth that they haven't been there before they let 'em on the ship 

583.11 584.43 B: oh okay 

583.32 591.69 A: but it's you know if there were danger of you know i mean talk about a a captive audience for disease you know a cruise ship with a thousand people on it [laughter] 

591.44 593.57 B: right [laughter] yes 

593.62 594.57 B: (( that it )) 

593.64 595.49 A: no place to escape [laughter] 

595.26 597.96 B: could spread very easily on a cruise ship then yeah
