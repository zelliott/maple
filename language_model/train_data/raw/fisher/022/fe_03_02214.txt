26.97 31.57 A: okay so you've got restaurants uh and um home cooking 

32.00 36.27 B: yeah um why don't you start ah which one do you like better 

36.79 39.08 A: um at home 

39.16 51.47 B: yes at home is much better of course um i i think it is better because not only at home every meal is made individually 

51.47 57.31 B: ah and it is made to the full attention of whoever is cooking it the be it 

57.21 59.70 B: wife girlfriend mother 

59.54 63.22 B: ah grandmother even or fathers but 

63.05 74.76 B: also since the ho- food cooked at home is prepared by somebody you probably know or at least are acquainted with i think they kind of know 

74.61 79.12 B: what you would like better and perhaps could customize a meal to your um 

79.13 81.10 B: specifications what do you think 

81.41 93.01 A: well i like the home cooking meals myself because of the fact of um you do- you don't know hm at the restaurant what type of chemical type additives they use in the food 

93.30 98.47 A: such as i guess what do you call that m._s._g. and all kind of different uh chemicals 

98.78 102.61 A: [laughter] which to into the food to so called make it taste better 

103.46 106.98 A: and you don't know what's in there um 

107.13 111.96 A: some of the restaurants [cough] do advertise they don't put any chemical agents in the uh 

111.97 113.85 A: (( food )) 

114.05 125.96 A: but ah i don- and i've worked in restaurants before and i know the um the sanitary conditions in a restaurant are not that great [laughter] 

125.69 130.93 B: yeah and um i i don't know if you've seen the book uh fast food nation it 

130.88 135.09 B: it's really revealing about what's what they do in 

134.99 146.73 B: restaurants such as fast food restaurants such as mcdonalds and um some of their food is genetically mutated like the chicken mcnuggets and some of the other food are it's just basically 

146.77 155.70 B: a concoction of chemicals and add with add a fe- a few drops of flavor to make it taste like it's real food 

154.79 156.42 A: right 

156.60 161.57 A: so the restaurant world is not that good for me and ah home cooking 

161.76 165.89 A: ah i don't buy organic food so to speak but ah 

165.98 169.67 A: [laughter] i'm getting near to that point to start buying food that's not uh 

170.02 174.92 A: um you know especially meats and chicken and stuff that are not fed uh chemically 

175.01 176.03 A: also 

176.96 190.02 B: yeah um food cooked at home mostly should be um more satis- satisfying to the person because um not not only it's probably cooked by somebody you know 

190.17 199.21 B: and they probably know what you you probably you want and even if you don't you could tell 'em what exactly do you want a little bit more salt a little less sugar 

199.08 213.88 B: th- the restaurants they're not going to know anything they're just gonna crank out meals uh like assembly line meals basically they just everything exactly the same no different it's pretty it's pretty generic and there's no personal touch to it of course yeah 

214.07 214.86 A: no 

215.82 225.58 A: there are a few restaurants back in i used to live in new york and they did have some good italian restaurants years ago in new york who it was really home cooking 

225.66 228.76 A: and not the processed type food they got today 

229.53 232.78 A: but the the quality of the food has changed because 

232.87 235.49 A: everybody wants to eat faster and 

235.51 239.33 A: supposedly the food tastes better [laughter] i don't know how that could be but 

239.77 248.27 A: they try to make it taste better i guess but i can't eat any of the like burger king or mcdonalds i can't eat that food 

248.52 249.84 A: can't digest it 

250.49 251.82 B: that sounds familiar 

250.77 251.81 A: (( my )) 

252.09 254.17 A: my stomach doesn't work on it 

254.66 267.91 B: yes some of the quality of the food has been on for quite a while now there used to be actual restaurants with um with actual people chefs who 

268.27 273.65 B: who have skills basically and now look at it very few restaurants 

273.73 278.14 B: act- actually have real chefs so to speak even those 

278.04 281.49 B: proc- self proclaimed gourmet restaurants which is 

281.37 295.91 B: i i don't know if you have them over there but here in los angeles we have an expresses well uh they claim to be um gourmet chinese food well i know for a fact since one of my friend's fathers own a chain of them they hire mexican cooks 

295.70 299.09 B: who know nothing about chinese food at all 

295.87 296.63 A: yeah 

298.47 299.84 A: [laughter] 

299.46 300.92 B: it's pretty sad 

300.86 303.81 A: yeah i was in where was it kansas city 

304.30 309.88 A: missouri and they had um one of the best italian restaurants 

310.02 318.01 A: that was there it was a chain of restaurants but they all cooked the food they had the directions on how to cook the food correctly 

318.17 319.56 A: and they 

320.36 324.87 A: weren't italian i believe they were probably spanish origin 

324.95 327.28 A: i think but that didn't 

327.48 330.82 A: (( the food wasn't bad to tell you the truth [laughter] it was real good )) 

331.00 337.71 A: when i asked the person i said how do they do this he said they make sure the ch- the the everybody go whoever cooks 

337.85 342.63 A: goes to school and they teach them how to cook exactly the way 

342.65 345.28 A: the company wants them to prepare the food 

345.88 348.34 A: and it was quite good 

348.41 349.97 B: yeah um if 

349.05 353.44 A: but i think it could be i think it's the um education wise too um 

353.50 357.36 A: now that italian place was even though it was a was a chain 

357.60 361.25 A: it did have outstanding food for an italian 

361.34 362.37 A: (( well )) 

362.65 367.30 A: non non italian people let's put it that way they weren't italian but they were educated 

367.35 370.16 A: on how to ah cook the food 

370.52 380.09 B: yeah and um some restaurants uh here in l._a. like in and out chains they're they're over here in uh california and i believe arizona um 

380.05 385.80 B: they are not a franchise restaurant although they're a chain um they're all owned by the same people and um 

385.69 399.76 B: all their food is um made quite well because not only i believe they um they have their own list of how to make it and they are all properly trained but also i believe what they have are people who 

399.70 406.71 B: uh they they're just like guests except they are paid to uh test to um eat the food and see how 

406.68 415.57 B: uh how on time the delivery is and uh how how well the food is cooked and everything and i believe in several other restaurants also have them i think 

415.46 426.19 B: jack in the box have them they're called um mystery guests if i'm not mistaken and i i think those really help to up the quality of food in restaurants to a certain standard i guess 

426.72 431.61 A: and jack in the box that used to be back east but they went out of business back east 

432.49 436.40 B: oh it's still everywhere over here uh on the west coast 

435.88 436.67 A: huh 

436.75 438.25 A: yeah 

437.03 438.39 B: every city has one 

438.26 443.28 A: they had them in connecticut i lived in connecticut they had them in connecticut but then they all of a sudden they disappeared 

444.43 455.09 B: i i believe back in nineteen ninety four nineteen ninety five they had uh a little salmonella thing where some kids died because of 

454.22 456.11 A: oh yeah yeah it might of been that 

456.57 461.14 B: yeah i i think that really took the comp- hit the company really hard uh 

461.10 471.81 B: for three or four years a lot of people just refused to eat at their place because of the infection but i i think it's a lot more clean- it's a lot cleaner now um i checked the restaurants 

471.85 478.14 B: around here and um they they look pretty clean compared to mcdonalds which is just a mess 

478.01 479.41 A: [laughter] 

479.51 481.75 A: old mcdonalds oh goodness 

482.54 487.21 A: yeah well i remember ah jack in the box it wasn't too bad 

487.61 494.37 A: when it was when i had uh one of their hamburgers i guess it was pretty good that's going back quite quite a few years 

494.78 499.13 A: [laughter] that's not that i remember exactly how it tastes even but 

500.13 503.73 A: as far as years ago when they had before they had uh what was the 

500.39 501.32 B: yeah 

503.99 507.20 A: fast food restaurant was what do they call that one it 

507.24 510.69 A: (( was twelve cents oh gee whiz )) 

511.58 514.61 A: i forget the name of it but it was had holes in the hamburger 

516.54 518.09 B: holes in the hamburger 

517.70 521.18 A: yeah castle some kind of name castle 

520.10 522.15 B: white castle white castle 

521.26 528.29 A: yeah white castle right it had four holes in the top of it and the hamburger was about a i guess a quarter 

528.52 538.13 A: a quarter of an inch about a quarter of an inch thick four holes in the hamburger why they did that i guess i suppose they cook fast or something 

538.33 543.29 A: (( and that's when i was growing up that was the only fast food place in [laughter] in brooklyn new york )) 

544.11 545.41 B: well um 

544.36 551.14 A: i think they still sell the white castle i don't know if they still have the but they still sell them sometimes frozen i've seen in the store 

551.44 557.18 B: oh i haven't seen a white castle anywhere around los angeles or anywhere in california too 

557.38 558.22 B: (( um )) 

558.40 568.09 B: for certain but what i have heard is that um because of the advent of mcdonalds and burger king all those chains um they can't really compete with um 

568.06 580.18 B: on the national level so they've retreated basically back into the south i think georgia and arkansas i know they still have some that's pretty much what i can um 

580.36 590.99 B: i know for sure and um a lot of people there still recommend them just like in and out here um they're much better than the big chain ones as far as i know 

592.00 593.23 A: yeah 

595.15 598.92 A: so our agreement is eat home [laughter] we're better off 

597.63 599.80 B: yes eat home [laughter]
