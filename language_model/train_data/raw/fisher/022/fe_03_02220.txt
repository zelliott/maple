548.68 549.53 A: mhm 

550.51 562.44 B: and then all i would need to do and then marinade it and all i would need to do the day i was cooking it is just you know put it in a pan and and finish cooking it with a lid or put it in the oven 

562.30 563.33 A: right 

562.52 567.55 B: but everything would be ready and it was just a matter of finishing it off
