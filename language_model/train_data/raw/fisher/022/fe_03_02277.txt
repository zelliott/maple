270.61 271.78 B: green tea 

271.38 276.47 A: mhm just recently i tried that for the benefits of um dieting 

276.27 277.14 B: uh-huh 

277.04 282.39 A: and i didn't like the taste of it have you so you've tried black tea 

282.63 288.98 B: yeah i personally don't really like it but i was told that if you have one or two cups a day it's good for you 

288.87 289.88 A: (( mhm mm )) 

289.21 295.59 B: 'cause it helps your body fight free radicals or something like that but i personally don't like it 

295.14 296.35 A: the taste 

295.88 298.98 B: [laughter] no it's kinda bitter i don't like it 

298.04 303.37 A: yeah the green tea i don't know if i did something wrong or what i think you're supposed to put a lot of sugar in it 

302.94 303.90 B: uh-huh 

303.60 307.37 A: and then i thought well that defeats the dieting purpose so 

307.43 310.97 A: i just yeah i have two boxes of it sitting up in my closet 

311.11 319.91 B: what do you think about dieting do you think it's important in order to stay well do you think it's important um to ke- to maintain a healthy weight 

320.14 329.96 A: i think it's important yeah i think you know not eating fast foods and greasy foods i think that can bring your body down where you might get sick more often 

329.78 330.86 B: mhm 

330.24 334.66 A: um i think it's important to eat a lot of fruits and vegetables to stay healthy 

335.25 340.30 A: and you know i've also heard if you exercise regularly that keeps your immune system 

340.17 341.35 B: yeah 

341.52 342.49 A: um 

342.50 344.13 A: you know going 

344.68 347.04 A: but i don't you know once in a while 

347.59 353.04 A: it's good i think to treat yourself to [laughter] something unhealthy [laughter] 

352.37 354.69 B: uh-huh yeah yeah yeah 

354.04 359.39 A: you have to [laughter] it's kind of a drag to think every day oh you know i got to eat healthy 

359.33 360.49 B: yeah 

359.41 366.17 A: um to stay well so once in a while it's okay to go off and you know have a little something special 

361.54 362.62 B: yeah yeah 

364.13 365.79 B: yeah yeah i agree 

366.16 373.80 B: and um how do you feel about like peace of mind and happiness do you think that's an important part of being being well 

374.10 375.19 A: yeah 

375.28 379.22 A: i think so i think you have to be happy with yourself and 

379.49 380.50 A: um 

380.80 382.16 A: (( you know and and )) 

382.43 387.98 A: and enjoy your surroundings in order to feel to feel good 

387.35 388.43 B: mhm 

388.55 389.66 A: what do you think 

389.82 393.60 B: yeah i think that's i think that's a very crucial part actually 

393.55 394.58 A: mhm 

393.64 400.90 B: i think um no matter how well you keep your body in shape if you're not you know if you have too much stresses you're unhappy 

401.09 407.44 B: with um what you're doing or in a relationship or whatsoever i think that's um 

407.61 409.79 B: can really really make you sick 

409.54 410.68 A: mhm 

411.04 414.51 A: yeah that's true i think anything that you know brings you down 

411.06 411.95 B: yeah 

414.56 421.18 A: and then you tend to you know get depressed and then you end up being irritable and and can get sick 

417.14 418.22 B: yeah 

421.12 424.59 B: yeah yeah yeah 

421.37 422.43 A: more often 

424.09 424.88 A: um 

424.82 426.70 B: and um 

427.62 436.15 B: how do you think uh [laughter] the change of seasons affects uh how we have to change our habits to stay well 

436.66 438.32 A: let's see maybe by 

438.40 439.86 A: dressing warmer 

440.21 447.59 A: um you know i like summer time because then it's warm out and yo- when you go out at night you don't have to think about bringing a jacket 

446.99 448.56 B: yeah me too 

447.68 452.72 A: but then i'm not prepared when you know in california the seasons seem to change real quick 

452.71 453.71 B: uh-huh 

453.31 454.39 A: and then 

454.41 456.56 A: suddenly it's not summer any more 

456.36 457.28 B: uh-huh 

457.07 458.54 A: and you're stuck 

458.57 461.66 A: you know out somewhere and you're freezing mhm mhm 

461.13 462.80 B: yeah yeah i know 

463.01 469.46 B: yeah so many times you know it's like really warm like especially in the winter time it's like eighty five degrees 

469.55 473.56 B: around noon and then around five o'clock you're like freezing [laughter] 

472.91 477.72 A: right or during the summer my kids enjoy you know the the beach a lot and 

477.02 478.33 B: mhm 

477.74 488.30 A: it's always freezing in the water it doesn't seem to matter to them but that's when you know a couple days later they get sick and then once the sickness starts with them it goes through our whole family 

488.05 489.38 B: (( uh-huh mm )) 

489.60 495.17 A: but i don't know if there's any way really to avoid that you know they have to have fun too 

493.24 495.46 B: (( yeah no i don't think so )) 

496.02 497.07 A: but i think 

496.25 501.89 B: i think you can't really avoid to getting i don't know get a getting flu you know occasionally 

500.95 503.52 A: yeah do you get a flu shot 

503.43 507.71 B: um i did last year i don't think i'm going to get it this year no 

507.55 510.43 A: no did you still get sick after getting the shot mhm 

509.83 510.86 B: no 

510.87 514.73 B: well i have like you know one or two colds a year but 

514.99 519.69 B: i i got it with with or without the flu shot so it didn't make a difference really 

520.12 521.03 A: right 

520.88 523.16 B: (( um then )) 

523.16 530.80 A: okay um usually what i do well actually last year was the first year that i got a flu shot and my kids did too my husband didn't want to get one 

530.59 531.69 B: (( oh okay )) 

531.22 539.12 A: but we before i'd gotten the flu shot we used to get the flu every year this is the first year knock wood that we haven't none of us has gotten it 

538.81 540.53 B: oh wow 

539.37 542.29 A: so i think i'm gonna start doing it every year 

542.09 544.14 B: yeah okay yeah probably 

542.30 544.78 A: i think it really has helped our family 

544.90 548.51 A: and plus they're around so many other kids and i work at their school 

548.36 549.47 B: uh-huh 

548.85 552.21 A: and there are so much germs you know going around there 

552.27 554.02 A: but i think it helps 

554.56 558.34 A: at least it seems to have helped us so far this year to stay well 

558.43 559.08 A: (( but )) 

558.49 560.53 B: yeah yeah probably 

559.43 562.84 A: we've just had our share you know a few little colds here and there 

562.55 563.55 B: uh-huh 

563.24 564.75 A: and that's been it 

565.23 566.73 B: yeah yeah 

566.54 570.34 A: and um one of their close friends up the street had the flu really bad and 

570.39 572.91 A: it managed to pass by us so 

573.45 575.39 A: i'm keeping my fingers crossed 

575.35 576.97 B: oh yeah [laughter] 

576.18 578.08 A: this is the time of year 

577.66 579.61 B: mhm mhm 

579.05 580.37 A: this is it 

580.91 592.23 B: and then um do you think it matters you know it affects your wellness if you're exposed to all that like public areas and stuff like that like if you work somewhere where it's like a lot of public traffic 

592.37 594.50 A: yeah i think like at the school 

594.71 599.95 A: or um you know like in the hospitals i've gone a few times to visit people and
