0.28 2.15 B: hi my name's jerry 

1.36 3.08 A: i'm christine 

2.68 4.31 B: hi christine how you doing today 

3.66 4.77 A: just fine 

5.17 7.40 B: topic of the day is illness huh 

7.01 8.59 A: correct colds 

8.35 11.30 B: ah colds and specifically i guess um 

11.53 12.19 B: (( i have )) 

12.51 16.19 B: a tendency to take uh i don't know if you've ever heard of cold ease 

16.75 18.82 B: kind of like zinc tablets 

16.78 17.91 A: um 

18.43 20.41 A: yes i've heard of those 

19.76 27.18 B: and uh i find that uh they certainly take the duration of the cold out of it and the severity of it 

27.47 33.44 B: and it's kinda hard to judge i guess if you don't have the full cold but i once i start taking those i really never get a 

33.64 38.22 B: a really bad cold where i have to call in sick to work or anything like that about you 

38.38 42.78 A: i start taking vitamin c. every two hours 

42.42 43.42 B: mhm 

42.79 45.36 A: and then i also put menthylatim 

45.37 46.78 A: in my nose 

46.83 48.14 B: oh that's a good idea 

47.17 48.45 A: for the sinus 

48.64 53.68 B: how many milligrams of vitamin c. do you try to average on a day where you're feeling sick 

53.29 61.42 A: um that goes what it's five hundred milligrams and i take like two every two hours so it's 

61.32 62.91 B: well i guess uh 

63.07 69.46 B: the body can't store it certainly doesn't manufacture it but if it gets uh an ample supply i guess it certainly help you 

69.60 74.68 A: i've just noticed that it helps me whenever i take it every two hours 

73.74 74.97 B: (( mm )) 

75.76 78.59 B: that's interesting i gotta give that a shot i think 

78.62 80.34 A: and i'm not into 

80.48 87.56 A: like really knowing the milligr- or you know how much my body can take or whatever i just don't get ill from it 

87.23 91.64 B: i'm i'm not a as far as i know i don't think you can take too much of it i mean 

91.67 99.25 B: especially in pill form i i have to question how much is actually absorbed into the body once uh once it's taken 

100.01 108.81 B: uh i know uh that it can't be all of it but um i guess the body uses what it needs but uh vitamin c. is definitely my mother always told me that as well 

109.45 113.12 B: i do notice though when the seasons change i do uh 

113.20 116.87 B: once in a while that's that's when i have the tendency to get more sick 

117.05 121.59 A: to me i sometimes feel that a cold is also allergies 

122.05 125.77 B: it could be um i don't suffer from allergies i'm fortunate do you oh 

122.38 123.02 A: (( if )) 

125.54 126.75 A: yes i do 

126.58 127.98 B: okay so 

127.18 131.90 A: and i live in an area where there are a lot of allergies a lot of pollen 

130.31 131.17 B: uh-huh 

131.49 132.43 B: where do you live 

132.44 133.66 A: florida 

133.16 137.23 B: oh okay you're talking to me in new york long island specifically 

135.05 135.71 A: ah 

137.26 139.31 A: i been there [laughter] 

138.26 142.78 B: [laughter] and we get we get the full uh the full swing of it that's for sure but um 

143.12 149.16 B: my wife's the same way she gets um well she has allergies as well but they're not uh not anywhere as near severe 

149.59 155.86 A: right well sometimes allergies and colds they mimic each other in the symptoms 

154.13 154.96 B: (( and )) 

155.37 159.11 B: yeah and it seems difficult to uh to differentiate where it came from 

159.01 165.50 A: right the sneezing and the fever and the lethargic feeling and everything 

166.63 168.62 B: mm right i'm fortunate where 

168.83 182.27 B: like i say when i take the zincs i i really don't feel it that bad and my job is pretty pretty on the move all the time so i really have to have my energy and everything and i find those certainly help me but uh 

182.11 186.78 B: vitamin c. i think i'll give that uh i take a daily vitamin but 

186.92 189.89 B: i guess it can't hurt to be taking those in addition to it 

188.30 189.44 A: [noise] 

190.99 192.87 A: hello oh okay 

191.51 192.62 B: yes i'm still here 

192.97 198.84 A: um [cough] i've never had a problem with it and i am real susceptible to medication 

198.75 199.60 B: uh-huh 

199.51 204.95 A: if i take any over the counter cold medication it puts me right to sleep 

204.54 207.79 B: yeah i have the same reaction to it i really don't care to do that 

207.71 214.44 A: and even on the now i'm drowsy i go right to sleep with it it makes me real lethargic 

212.31 213.08 B: yeah 

214.77 220.97 B: i can't be that way because i mean we have you know we have a child in the house and it's like you know you gotta have your wits about you and stuff and 

221.65 224.66 B: can't go to sleep until basically he's asleep so [laughter] 

223.83 227.23 A: [laughter] correct [laughter] that is correct 

227.14 230.23 B: but uh uh i also have would suffer from um 

231.06 237.03 B: uh from headaches in the early spring and the early fall the cold that are cluster headaches 

237.13 239.86 B: and that comes from the change of the seasons as well 

239.94 243.03 B: they don't know what causes them they last for like two weeks 

243.21 247.37 B: they're severe migraines where you they usually occur in the evening 

247.52 249.94 B: and when you come home um 

250.55 256.35 B: you just you gotta go to bed there's nothing you can do you can't they're very light sensitive and noise sensitive 

256.14 260.25 A: do you have the symptoms of cold when you have that no 

258.74 260.49 B: no no not at all 

260.63 263.44 B: interestingly enough and then two weeks and then they're gone 

263.26 266.42 A: that's more allergy i think than cold 

266.56 272.10 B: i've been to a neurologist for it and um i actually been to two and that's what they both diagnosed so 

268.68 269.35 A: mm 

272.17 287.13 B: i did some research on the internet for it as well and uh they don't know what causes it they have no idea but uh it just goes away and it does some years i don't get them and some years i get them one season and and sometimes i get them both seasons 

286.88 287.51 A: (( [noise] )) 

287.16 289.69 B: it's really weird and usually in march 

289.93 292.43 B: and usually october 

293.39 294.50 B: and uh 

293.95 297.63 A: to me that's the change of seasons where there's a lot of pollen 

295.75 303.85 B: it is it is um it but you know oddly enough i'm not i'm not allergic to anything during the rest of the year go out and cut the 

302.71 303.27 A: [noise] 

303.35 303.98 A: (( mm )) 

304.33 308.26 B: cut the grass and everything and and it's no problem 

304.77 305.81 A: [noise] sorry 

307.80 308.70 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

308.37 311.80 B: i don't take uh you know allegra or anything like that 

312.22 314.75 B: claritin's or you name it i i 

314.86 316.50 B: don't feel the need for it 

316.24 320.66 A: [noise] [noise] so have you ever taken anything besides um 

321.34 323.90 A: the zinc for your colds or 

323.09 324.16 B: um 

324.62 329.68 B: no not really i mean i'll just you know i'll drink i'll have a tendency to drink more uh orange juice 

329.90 331.64 A: [noise] which is vitamin c 

331.08 335.20 B: oh vitamin c. also um cranberry juice i'll drink too 

334.98 335.84 A: uh-huh 

335.56 338.96 B: uh cranberry juice is uh good for cleaning the blood 

338.39 339.13 A: [noise] 

339.65 350.55 B: and um i feel that uh i guess it takes uh maybe some of the toxins that may accelerate the cold out and kinda weans down the acceleration of the cold as well 

339.97 340.62 A: [noise] 

351.61 357.63 B: um but that's about it do you do anything that preventive besides the vitamin c yeah 

355.37 356.81 A: for a cold 

357.03 358.31 A: um 

358.70 360.52 B: anything you can think of anyway 

360.58 363.15 A: what i ha- do is menthylatim 

363.28 365.79 A: in the nasal every night 

365.59 367.36 B: mhm and 

366.48 370.43 A: and i started that in september because 

370.45 378.49 A: at the time it's going from well where i live it's very high humidity very hot and you're in refrigerated air all the time 

378.35 379.85 B: so it's very dry 

378.46 386.38 A: so you do not know if you have your allergies or if you have a cold you know because you're going between 

381.92 383.56 B: (( mm )) 

387.13 390.59 A: different weather cond- you know different weather types 

390.13 393.33 B: yeah you're going in from one extreme to another basically 

391.91 393.73 A: right right 

393.81 400.67 A: and so um i just it just dawned on me that i've always used 

400.84 405.02 A: you know menthylatim to cure everything whenever i'm ill 

405.64 407.46 A: or you know bad sinus 

407.31 408.55 B: right 

408.10 412.74 A: and so or nasal congestion whether it's cold or allergies 

413.18 415.17 A: and so i just kept it up 

415.23 417.12 A: ever since september 

416.32 418.57 B: (( mm that's a good idea i gotta )) 

417.77 422.72 A: and the one week that i didn't do it then i started sneezing and feeling ill 

422.62 423.51 B: wow 

423.63 429.70 A: and then our weather's been kinda sunny very hot and humid and then it goes very extreme cold 

429.74 431.50 B: what is it like right now 

431.86 437.75 A: um it's about eighty five degrees but then you have refrigerated air and everything 

434.74 436.23 B: oh it is very warm then 

437.36 438.60 B: right 

438.21 444.52 A: but then there is a lot of pollen and there are a lot of colds and a lot of sinus going around 

444.32 450.27 B: uh and another thing is uh my job i get uh i get exposed to a lot of different illnesses as well 

449.69 450.54 A: uh-huh 

450.27 462.14 B: and um i think uh that's part of the reason that i keep up on uh like my daily vitamins and stuff like that but uh on top of that i think actually my body's built somewhat of an immunity it's been 

462.13 467.26 B: a little bit of um say a plus if you would look at it that way 

467.46 475.40 B: um that [cough] uh when i first started out i would you know get sick more often more a as i used but i notice that 

475.33 483.08 B: i don't um i'm i'm a little less susceptible every year to to catching something or uh getting uh getting sick 

482.44 484.93 A: you've built your immunity up to it 

484.50 485.66 B: pardon me 

485.06 487.85 A: you've built your immunity up to it [laughter] 

486.52 488.85 B: i believe i have yeah i really do 

488.83 490.98 A: by being around it all the time 

490.43 499.68 B: yeah and uh we get we get a whole bunch of different illnesses so [laughter] but i mean the common cold and everything like that you know it's uh whatever flu strain is uh popular 

499.89 504.22 B: um and uh i think it's er certainly helped me build up my immunity 

503.91 507.42 A: i'm also a habitual hand cleaner 

507.66 508.70 B: i am too 

507.66 509.29 A: and and arm cleaner 

508.85 510.58 B: i am too my hands are 

509.61 512.02 A: anti bacterial soap and 

511.41 513.18 B: (( oh yeah )) 

512.16 517.12 A: i've read too where that's not as good for you because then you're doing away with 

517.27 520.41 A: germs that you can be getting you know 

520.64 522.67 A: that you're getting accustomed to 

523.74 535.78 B: true uh i think the worst part of it is i always have chapped hands as a result of using the alcohol based and and uh various products the puerile to to just clean my hands from time to time 

535.69 546.43 B: so i come in contact with uh people and it's like all right let me just i act- every time i come home obviously i'm washing up and everything i try to do so before leaving work 

546.81 557.23 B: and uh just to keep it out of my own home so if my immunities are being built up that's great but that doesn't necessarily mean everybody that's here has got the same results 

556.82 558.47 A: right for your family 

558.03 559.65 B: exactly 

559.62 563.00 A: well then too you have your germs on your clothing 

562.71 564.61 B: right well i make it 

563.06 564.80 A: that just you know 

564.68 574.77 B: for- fortunately i wear a uniform so generally when i'm done with my shift i just uh change back into my regular clothes and i come back home so most of that is 

569.68 570.71 A: change 

574.01 576.19 A: sounds like you're in the medical field 

575.61 579.58 B: i'm not actually [laughter] i'm in the law enforcement field 

576.46 577.23 A: (( ah )) 

579.02 580.05 A: ah 

580.20 581.97 A: yes so then you are 

583.47 584.44 A: you are 

583.59 587.47 B: and and it's not such a sterile environment on a regular basis so 

586.55 589.70 A: no it's not no it is not 

587.49 593.63 B: [laughter] no um and most of the time i work in a closed environment and i do i don't think uh 

593.98 597.04 B: nasser county's ventilation system is very good so 

597.00 597.65 A: mm 

597.64 599.89 B: uh they have and germs have a tendency to
