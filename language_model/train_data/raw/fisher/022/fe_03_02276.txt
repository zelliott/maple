3.24 4.85 A: hi i'm theresa 

4.69 6.15 B: hi theresa 

5.49 6.34 A: hi 

6.19 7.63 B: how are you doing today 

7.02 8.57 A: oh i'm pretty good 

8.24 11.69 B: so we're supposed to talk about allergies and things like that huh 

10.22 15.57 A: yeah i gu- i guess so [laughter] i've never done this is my first call ho- how about you oh 

11.74 12.98 B: [laughter] 

14.98 20.04 B: well yes it's the first one for me too so this is going to be an interesting situation 

19.64 22.40 A: yeah i don- i wasn't sure how it worked 

22.30 27.99 B: um well i know that um a lot of times i get allergies in the fall rather than in the spring 

27.74 34.83 A: yeah well with me i'm kind of the opposite i usually get 'em in the spring early just the early spring after that i'm usually fine 

31.66 32.51 B: yeah 

33.56 34.54 B: early spring 

34.87 45.56 B: yeah so um well i'm in north carolina so we have we're in full fledged into the the season that people are having problems with their eyes and things like that 

44.85 46.95 A: yeah well i'm not far i'm in kentucky 

46.86 48.58 B: oh okay okay 

47.61 53.50 A: yeah actually i just had my first bout with allergies a couple of weeks ago we went me and my son went camping 

53.48 54.31 B: (( uh-huh )) 

53.90 58.63 A: and just all of a sudden like a ton of bricks i just started uh my throat was hurting my 

58.75 62.26 A: like i had the sinus pressure you know my head was hurting real bad and 

62.32 71.41 A: you know i thought i was coming down you know with a virus or something and then uh my mom said yeah i think it's probably allergies and 'cause bu- but the next day i was fine 

68.23 69.58 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

71.40 76.51 B: oh well it takes one day do you ha- do you generally have to take medicine for it or 

76.24 84.98 A: no i mean usually i just uh every now and then i'll just take some over the counter stuff you know i'm not i don't see a doctor for my allergies or anything like that because it's not that severe 

80.39 81.29 B: oh 

84.80 97.58 B: well i was taking um allegra for mine it seemed to help because well one of the problems that i have is when i when i do have the allergies at the strange time then i end up with a sinus infection 

88.01 88.98 A: (( oh yeah )) 

97.42 98.36 A: mhm 

97.70 102.50 B: and then after the sinus infection i end up with bronchitis so i end up with 

102.80 105.31 B: major problems and have to go to the doctor 

104.74 106.34 A: (( yeah sounds bad )) 

105.46 111.73 B: but he gave me allegra but now i don't have insurance so i'm not taking that any more [laughter] 

110.14 112.15 A: yeah i know how that is too 

112.17 114.35 A: without insurance 

114.49 118.00 B: my husband generally takes as far as the um 

118.32 123.95 B: uh allergies are concerned he generally takes benadryl and he seems to be okay on that 

123.32 124.16 A: really 

124.07 127.93 B: yeah this is really strange talking about this kind of stuff isn't it 

127.55 132.17 A: yeah especially with a party that you've never spoken to in your whole entire life [laughter] it's weird 

128.12 129.20 B: [laughter] 

131.14 135.07 B: [laughter] yeah it is kinda strange but um we 

133.79 146.13 A: yeah i actually i fo- i totally forgot about it you know i i was signed up for it on the internet earlier today and then um i went to the grocery and i just got back from the grocery and the phone rang and i looked at caller i._d. i was like mm and then when i had answered it 

136.17 137.09 B: (( uh )) 

139.27 140.14 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

146.01 146.87 B: (( uh-huh )) 

146.33 148.34 A: and then it i was like oh yeah [laughter] 

148.30 160.32 B: well i didn't even get to the phone in time so then they had so then i called and they're like no you need to call the computer so and i find out today earlier too and i was like damn this happened really quick i was kinda surprised 

153.29 154.53 A: (( oh yeah )) 

157.60 159.00 A: yeah [noise] 

160.55 170.47 B: but um generally the fall let's see if i have to take something in the fall i generally take the over the counter stuff because i just started taking the allegra 

171.54 173.84 B: now working in the yard yesterday 

173.89 177.21 B: i had really bad swollen eyes 

177.05 178.23 A: yeah 

177.58 183.80 B: but sleeping seemed to help that so i really didn't have to go to the doctor or do anything with that 

183.17 185.26 A: oh that's good [noise] 

184.23 189.78 B: that that always helps yest always seems to help me a lot more than other things do 

190.13 191.87 A: uh i always um 

190.48 191.32 B: but 

191.87 206.72 A: i got a six year old little boy and i worry about him 'cause he's he's had like off and on problems with allergies and they have you know when he was younger they said well you know what when he's so little it's really hard for us to tell anything you know you just have to wait till he grows and see if he grows out of it or 

198.14 198.96 B: (( uh-huh )) 

203.82 204.74 B: yeah 

206.87 211.37 A: 'cause he used to have to take um a breathing treatment on a breathing machine 

210.57 212.39 B: (( oh my yeah )) 

211.75 222.39 A: yeah he used to have to do that and um he hasn't had to do any of that lately but when it gets real real hot i notice he has a little bit difficulty breathing and you know that co- that could even be asthma 

217.57 218.33 B: (( uh-huh )) 

222.35 223.35 B: right 

222.94 224.09 A: (( and um )) 

224.12 232.84 A: so that's still something we we keep battling with and we're not really sure because it's just so sporadic it's nothing you know consistent so we don't know what to do 

230.15 231.20 B: yeah 

232.73 245.88 B: well m- my um nephew he's six and he's had problems with everything and he had to have allergy tests done and he's allergic to all trees except carolina pine trees he's in north carolina 

240.32 241.21 A: uh-huh 

243.98 244.95 A: goodness 

245.40 247.13 A: yeah 

246.10 259.26 B: that's the only tree he's not allergic to now a long time ago when i was a kid i had allergy shots but i seem to be allergic to molds and things like that rather than well at that time anyway rather than the um 

251.50 252.22 A: uh-huh 

260.06 266.72 B: you know the trees and all those kinds of things one of the things that that the doctor told me to take is echinacea 

266.81 267.79 A: (( oh yeah )) 

267.58 270.82 B: yeah but it seemed to help and it did help 

269.09 272.17 A: i've heard of that for so many other things but not for um 

271.19 272.11 B: yeah 

272.95 274.12 A: allergies 

274.42 287.47 B: it helps will boost your immune system for everything so it helps and he even gave me that when i had a virus one time so i was like okay so i take that oh the other thing that's really good for allergies is 

277.61 278.49 A: (( mhm )) 

282.48 283.18 A: (( oh yeah )) 

287.59 292.69 B: what is it called oh now it's something seal um golden seal 

292.38 293.20 A: uh-huh 

293.12 298.67 B: golden seal helps with allergies it gets rid of all the mucus and stuff and 

297.45 299.41 A: is what is what is golden seal 

299.15 301.29 B: it's um it's an herb 

301.31 302.94 A: okay see i'm all in um 

302.63 303.88 B: yeah 

303.24 305.20 A: whatever i can do naturally you 

304.87 305.96 B: yeah 

305.40 309.99 A: know 'cause i don't have health insurance either right now and it's just if i can do it cheaper [laughter] 

307.48 308.46 B: yeah 

309.82 312.96 B: and it doesn't make you sick either which is really nice 

311.17 316.21 A: yeah that's what i like about natural stuff is yo- you don't have to worry about side effects and 

313.25 314.25 B: yeah 

315.07 324.68 B: and after you take it for about two weeks it helps to make everything you you feel better i don't have i don't end up with the sinus strains i always have this little 

317.25 318.05 A: uh-huh 

324.79 326.82 B: [cough] in my throat all the time 

326.29 327.37 A: yeah 

326.70 330.21 B: from allergies no matter what time of the year it is 

330.00 336.51 B: and that seems to help that a little bit so i i generally try to do that my doctor for some reason 

336.29 351.23 B: he just started doing this where he would say okay why don't you try taking some kind of herbs instead of other things and that way maybe that'll help you a little bit and then of course that was before he knew that i lost my insurance so 

350.38 351.79 A: yeah 

351.24 352.95 B: i lost my job so 

353.00 355.61 B: my husband couldn't pay for the insurance any more 

355.83 356.54 A: (( [cough] )) 

355.99 356.72 B: (( so )) 

357.24 362.92 A: yeah they yeah they need to have a um topic next on on insurance 'cause i could talk forever about that [laughter] 

361.75 362.81 B: yeah 

363.22 369.55 B: [laughter] who knows i don't even know how the you know as far as how many topics they end up with i was surprised i was called so fast 

368.92 370.21 A: yeah me too 

370.15 380.73 B: but um i don't know what else i would do for allergies i usually i usually do that oh i know what my mom does and you're probably going to be grossed out by this but she she um 

378.38 379.35 A: (( what uh-huh )) 

381.27 382.43 B: takes 

382.62 390.94 B: salt water warm she warms it and she puts salt in it so that it you know just tastes salty and she sniffs it up her nose 

388.84 389.62 A: yeah 

390.73 392.44 A: oh really [laughter] 

391.79 403.42 B: yeah she it she says it works she can breathe it's great cleans out all it's kinda gross 'cause you know kinda all that water and gro- gross stuff goes down in your throat and you gotta spit it out in droplets 

394.98 395.80 A: oh 

401.41 402.38 A: yeah 

402.88 412.66 A: well we haven't been able to you know the the inhalers that you you know the stuff that you sniff up your nose that you go at the store and get you know the nasal sprays i guess that's um 

409.10 410.73 B: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

411.18 412.54 B: (( yeah and all that stuff )) 

413.54 417.65 A: a good idea probably it's just that i never i would never even think of 

414.79 415.76 B: yeah 

416.85 424.45 B: well it's warmer which you know rather than the stuff you get at the store i know that one stuff that you get at the store can be um 

421.06 421.89 A: yeah 

424.49 435.93 B: you can uh get addicted to it again you know the other stuff is just saline solution and the doctor said well if you're going to use saline solution just use water 'cause it's cheaper and the saline solution burns 

426.47 427.51 A: yeah 

429.83 430.65 A: yeah 

433.26 434.16 A: yeah 

436.13 443.44 B: (( whereas the water with the just the like i said just a little bit of salt you just so it tastes it doesn't burn your nose or anything )) 

439.74 440.62 A: mhm 

443.23 451.30 A: yeah that'd probably be better 'cause i know i've had to take that stuff before and and when it does start dripping back down your throat it's just it it tastes nasty 

444.07 445.22 B: which is like 

450.61 452.39 B: (( oh yeah it does )) 

451.32 453.96 A: but salt water you know it really don't taste all that bad mm 

453.62 458.26 B: yeah no the salt water it's actually yeah that being pretty good it's not too shabby 

458.37 462.55 B: and she she does that every morning she says i can breathe 'cause i do that every morning 

462.60 466.65 B: like well i don't do it every morning so sometimes i still can't breathe but 

466.60 474.22 B: it seems like i just have all kinds of sinus problems more than i have the acute allergy type things when the seasons change you 

473.50 474.75 A: yeah 

474.12 484.27 B: know my husband has problems with them but only when the seasons change and then he also has a problem where he has to take things that are not uh drying 

484.45 485.37 A: uh-huh 

485.06 487.73 B: because he doesn't have any saliva glands 

487.32 488.45 A: oh no 

487.85 495.67 B: 'cause he got his saliva glands burnt by um radiation so if he takes something you know it dries out mouth out 

495.02 495.96 A: yeah 

495.70 510.43 B: things like ugh paste well his is worse than that because he doesn't have anything he doesn't have anything to wet his throat at all or his mouth at all so he gets really upset with me 'cause i tell him to take stuff and he's just like i don't know what to take 

500.86 501.51 A: (( [cough] )) 

509.89 510.81 A: [laughter] 

510.93 511.79 B: so 

512.09 514.48 B: but that's about all i do i guess 

514.15 515.42 A: yeah um 

514.57 517.29 B: i try to do all of those different kinds of things 

516.91 527.12 A: yeah have you ever thought about a um which i don't know if if this has anything to do with seasonal allergies or not just depending i guess maybe with the molt and the pollens getting in your house but um 

527.18 531.80 A: oh what am i thinking those um air purifiers or whatever they have 

530.09 542.83 B: yeah yeah yeah i my mom has one of those because um my dad smokes and she's allergic to that so she ta- she uses one of those that would probably be good if you kept everything um closed up 

535.44 536.54 A: (( mhm )) 

542.49 544.45 A: yeah 

543.18 546.97 B: i don't know whether it work if you had the windows open and things like that 

545.53 553.74 A: i don't know 'cause when it's the um actually today's the first day i've turned my air conditioner on up until now i've had the windows open and everything and 

553.30 554.76 B: is it warm there 

554.41 557.43 A: yeah well it's about well 

557.54 570.79 A: in in the house it was almost eighty degrees that's why i turned the air on yeah but up until now it's been kind of like inbetween it's been a little cool a little warm and um i just i just love the the natural the the smell coming through the house 

559.71 562.71 B: oh wow yeah that's a little stuffy 

566.12 567.03 B: yeah 

570.16 571.67 B: oh yeah me too 

570.90 571.97 A: so so 

572.57 577.28 B: yeah well when you turn your air conditioner on i guess that probably would help 

577.33 578.54 B: a little bit 

577.37 578.30 A: yeah 

579.18 582.06 B: yeah an air purifier would probably help 

579.69 580.54 A: yeah 

581.69 582.80 A: i'm sorry 

582.53 585.31 B: i said yeah an air purifier probably would help 

584.85 591.12 A: yeah that's it ah it's something i always had in the back of my mind that i thought about getting and i just never have gotten one uh-huh 

588.43 589.33 B: yeah 

590.72 599.89 B: yeah my mom has one uh uh in her house because of my dad smoking but not for anything else but i guess it would i guess it helps with everything else too but
