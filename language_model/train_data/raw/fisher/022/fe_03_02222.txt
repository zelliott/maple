111.62 112.75 B: [laughter] 

118.06 119.22 B: oh [laughter] 

119.83 120.71 B: mhm 

120.53 121.60 A: and 

120.79 123.87 B: i i've just been trying to lately eat at home to you know 

124.05 125.36 B: (( dieting )) 

125.86 127.96 A: (( me too dieting is that what you said )) 

127.84 131.50 B: yeah dieting 'cause it's kinda hard to diet when you eat out all the time 

130.99 134.01 A: i stopped with like the regular fast foods 

133.57 134.37 B: mhm 

134.17 143.11 A: and started doing the same thing where i'd get you know chicken breasts and that and just cook it but they're sort of like plain meals but i like it or salads 

143.27 144.15 A: but i 

143.52 144.35 B: well see 

144.64 155.84 B: whenever 'cause whenever i did fast food i'd used to always just get a salad so that's more healthier for you which i read up on and online different ingredients so i used to always get the caesar salad at chick fillet 

155.87 165.73 B: whenever anybody at work ordered chick fillet i would just get the caesar salad and it turned out the caesar salads have more fat in it because of the dressing and everything than like the chicken sandwich [laughter] 

163.24 165.16 A: than if you were to get a hamburger 

165.51 175.48 A: i know i actually i downloaded all the different fast food calories and everything subway dunkin' donuts burger king mcdonald's and compared what could i order if i went out 

175.50 176.48 A: but 

176.54 177.37 A: subway 

176.79 180.92 B: i think i think that subway diet i think that's b._s. 

179.20 180.48 A: mhm 

180.91 181.78 A: do you 

180.98 185.34 B: but i think all these people are losing weight 'cause all those carbs that you're eating 

185.56 190.76 B: you know it doesn't matter if it's wheat or what it is i mean it's still carbs and it is still fattening 

190.11 197.00 A: it probably helps for the person who does fast food like if they were getting mcdonald's you know and you're getting the 

196.07 197.30 B: every day mm 

197.03 203.30 A: the fries and a big mac and then you switch to subway it probably does make a big difference just with calories 

201.88 202.70 B: yeah 

203.52 208.46 A: but i don't know i'm not on a subway diet [laughter] i'm just trying to eat healthier 

205.91 206.67 B: [laughter] 

208.40 220.82 A: and you know it is interesting that the fast food restaurants are all starting to have salads you know mcdonald's now has it and wendy's that's what i started getting from them but getting the fat free dressing or not using dressing at all 

208.53 209.82 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

220.93 221.86 B: yeah 

221.03 222.75 A: because you're right because it is 

222.95 226.60 A: you you think you're doing well but i maybe you're eating more nutritious 

226.83 228.74 A: that's the thing go ahead 

226.94 227.91 B: is it is 

228.35 230.23 B: this your first phone call you're doing 

230.09 232.02 A: no this is my second 

231.36 232.67 B: (( oh this is my third one )) 

232.35 234.47 A: is it your third is it all the same topic 

234.59 237.44 B: no the first one i had was um 

237.63 239.99 B: (( about computer games )) 

239.83 240.54 A: mm 

240.25 246.92 B: and the second one i had was about like basically the economy and what what about the war and everything with iraq and all that stuff 

247.63 250.97 B: that was a hard topic to keep up for ten minutes [laughter] 

249.72 253.93 A: [laughter] yeah that would be difficult but i like a good challenge sometimes 

253.72 254.83 B: [laughter] 

254.91 262.99 A: but um eating at restaurants i you know what you know the more i say i'd rather eat out i wanna eat out for the convenience sake 

262.74 263.91 B: mhm 

263.28 268.62 A: and then sometimes like i do i do like different i like to go to the olive garden and i like to go to 

268.63 275.65 A: you know appleby's and i like to t._g._i. fridays i just i like those types of places they're a little diff- each one's a little different 

273.32 274.16 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

276.31 277.54 A: but 

277.64 282.64 A: i don't get an opportunity to you know i say i may prefer i but i actually do eat more in 

279.82 280.70 B: yeah 

282.80 289.97 B: yeah it's kinda hard for me to continue eating out at you know four course restaurants now 'cause i have a two year old and he doesn't want to sit still 

289.84 291.17 A: yeah 

291.04 295.44 B: we took him we went to hard rock cafe i took my mom there for her birthday and it was awesome 

295.70 310.65 B: even though i i ended up sending back my food i ordered um it was like the flaming it was like the most expensive one on the menu and i ordered that and it was supposed to be so tender and everything and it came it was so tiny it looked like one bite and it was burnt 

310.93 311.81 A: oh 

311.22 319.21 B: i mean it was so dry i had to send it back it was disgusting and i ended up getting like the t. bone steak which was oh it was so good [laughter] 

318.79 320.41 A: do do you um 

320.92 323.43 A: like get your hopes set on something like 

323.55 328.04 A: do you get disappointed easily if it's not exactly what you think it's going to be when you go to the restaurant 

326.86 334.54 B: yeah i i'm picky when it comes to food that's why if i go out on a date i like ordering something i've already ate before so i know that i like it 

332.79 335.80 A: so that you have that it's safe [laughter] [laughter] i 

334.96 343.56 B: so i'm not sending back food [laughter] when i'm like on a date i don't mind sending back food if you know if i'm with the family or something if i don't like it i'm not going to eat it you know 

343.37 348.94 A: have a sister like that i usually end up eating it anyways she'll be like oh this is the worst thing i've had oh this is the 

349.03 351.22 A: but i ended up usually end up eating it 

349.81 353.97 B: i get disappointed if i go to a restaurant going out to eat and i don't like the food 

354.29 356.24 B: i get so mad [laughter] 

356.15 363.44 A: well like i said 'cause we don't i don't get to go to you know i don't go to restaurant restaurants fast food all the time but not restaurants as often 

363.77 365.38 A: as i'd like and uh 

365.66 372.68 A: so you do kinda have this anticipation that it's going to be a nice time out and that you're going to get a good meal and really enjoy it 

371.13 374.11 B: at least you don't have to worry about dishes and all that [laughter] yeah 

373.26 375.73 A: oh i know i know that 

374.68 381.85 B: i don't i don't mind cooking if i'm cooking like we always have potlucks at my work and i usually cook up like four trays of lasagna 

378.59 379.60 A: mhm 

381.78 395.25 B: and last time i cooked up like a big like two trays of um you know chicken with potatoes and sweet potatoes i don't mind cooking if i'm co- cooking for like a whole bunch of people but if i'm just cooking a dinner for myself i'll cook something easy at the house 

393.33 395.09 A: it's not worth all the mess 

395.01 401.14 A: see i for like our family dinners and stuff like when we have like christmas and things i do all most of the cooking 

395.90 396.49 B: (( mm )) 

401.02 412.82 A: but i always have people who help they'll come and they'll help clean up like i'll do it like you i'll do the you know the trays of the lasagna the turkey the everything but it seems like i have someone come over and that's their way of helping 

412.67 424.22 A: is they'll clean they'll wash the dishes as i'm going and like that's like pure heaven to me i'll cook all you want as long as you clean [laughter] the dishes 'cause i cannot stand we make homemade pastas and stuff 'cause we're italian 

420.10 420.97 B: yeah 

424.02 426.14 B: (( yeah we're italian too [laughter] )) 

425.27 433.51 A: so we make homemade pastas and that's like a big mess but i'll do it i'll make for you know the entire everybody could have you know dozens and dozens but 

433.57 437.83 B: see my parents my parents used to own um italian restaurants when i was young 

433.64 434.87 A: help me clean 

436.78 438.36 A: oh did they really 

437.85 452.64 B: yeah so we're used to like all of our food we're used to cooking everything home made but i actually bought um 'cause we make like a lot of lasagnas and stuff and i bought those those noodles that you just add the sauce and it cooks in there lasagna noodles 

450.98 451.80 A: uh-huh

454.85 455.90 A: was it really 

455.69 465.71 B: mhm you don't have to worry about boiling all the noodles because i think lasagna is so easy to make you know you just boil the noodles and put everything down and that's it yeah [laughter] 

462.32 464.20 A: just layer it and it's in there 

464.65 474.14 A: it's like i like like mon- we make homemade monacari uh it's a little bit more work than like the lasagna 'cause you make we make the shells and everything but i feel like i get more cheese then
