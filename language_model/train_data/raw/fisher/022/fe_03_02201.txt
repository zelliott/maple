2.79 5.18 B: hello my name is jane 

5.12 7.49 A: hi jane my name is jim 

7.22 8.54 B: (( hi jim )) 

8.05 9.32 A: how are you 

8.87 10.49 B: i'm doing fine 

9.88 14.67 A: good ah talking about food they only give us ten minutes huh 

14.35 19.23 B: yeah restaurant or at home cooking i like to do at home cooking 

18.92 30.19 A: well ah i obviously like home cooking the best myself because that's where you get homemade the best nutritious meals i would think 

29.56 32.16 B: do you cook for more than one person 

32.20 41.79 A: well um my wife and i kind of share the duties ah i will do some cooking and she does some cooking and [laughter] 

37.50 38.46 B: uh-huh 

41.15 46.61 B: what um do you like ethnic food better or just meat and potatoes oh 

47.05 52.36 A: well that's a good question because they did ask us to name our favorite thing to eat i guess 

51.56 53.21 B: uh-huh yeah 

52.51 54.01 A: our favorite meal 

53.74 54.73 B: yeah 

54.09 62.69 A: um i've kind of tempered that because i've tried to ah cut down the number of carbohydrates that i take in 

62.37 63.44 B: okay 

63.04 72.23 A: and so i i cut out the ah white potatoes and the white bread and rice and things and pasta and things like that best i could 

70.03 70.90 B: okay 

71.58 72.78 B: yeah 

72.12 86.26 A: but if it was before i started doing that i could name you a lot of good things [laughter] that are my favorite meal ah but since that time ah i guess you could say um ah i love fish 

78.23 79.37 B: yeah 

86.57 87.88 A: um 

86.59 91.05 B: oh yeah fish yeah the fish and chicken are my two favorites 

88.09 90.02 A: i love fish ah 

90.45 97.55 A: fish and chicken are my favorite by far and ah i don't know what part of the country you're in but i'm down 

91.42 93.81 B: yeah yeah uh-huh 

96.54 98.30 B: i'm in dallas texas 

97.95 102.35 A: well i'm in paris texas i'm a hundred miles north east of you 

101.79 103.66 B: oh okay all right 

102.86 109.68 A: and um i have a sister that lives in plano so i do get over there quite a bit and my parents live in downtown dallas so 

107.09 108.06 B: (( oh okay )) 

108.91 110.63 B: uh-huh oh okay 

109.59 118.21 A: i'm over there all the time but ah anyway um here in paris obviously we don't have as many things available to eat at as you do 

117.71 118.73 B: uh-huh 

118.30 127.13 A: and so that's interesting that you like uh the home cooked meal the best because you have so many good places to eat out 

126.69 129.23 B: yeah but i'm just one person 

128.83 129.98 A: yes 

129.49 135.39 B: and so even though i have room mates you know we each cook separately 

134.75 136.03 A: (( i see )) 

135.47 141.25 B: and so i would cook like on saturday or sunday i'll make a big crock pot of chili 

140.57 141.99 A: oh yeah 

141.29 143.87 B: and and and then 

143.56 145.78 A: so what would be your favorite then 

145.68 152.73 B: probably um green chili is probably my favorite and by the end of the week 

150.49 152.28 A: (( mm )) 

153.04 165.46 B: you know it's getting pretty small portion or whatever and i'll start adding stuff to it you know like ah maybe a salad or whatever the first couple of days you know i'll just eat it as a stew 

156.84 157.83 A: yeah 

160.99 162.08 A: yeah 

165.24 169.67 A: now when you say green chili exactly what ah 

168.55 171.95 B: green chili is the the the 

172.10 178.84 B: green hatch chilies that have been roasted and peeled and seeded and then chopped up 

178.43 179.51 A: oh 

178.95 189.20 B: and then you add um you put them in last of course because you don't want to dissolve them but you use like maybe pork or chicken and saute it get it brown and then 

188.37 189.47 A: oh 

189.33 201.13 B: then i pour in a can of beer and make it all real tender and then you know couple of cans of chicken stock and potato onion some garlic and then it's all done 

193.61 194.65 A: yeah 

198.73 199.50 A: (( yeah )) 

201.11 203.18 B: i put in my um 

203.11 210.34 B: green chilies and then a cup of of you know water and and flour stock and make it thick 

208.67 209.94 A: (( oh okay )) 

209.96 210.94 A: (( all right )) 

210.20 218.69 B: and so by the time the end of the week is you know i've like served it over rice i've like you know served it on a hot dog 

218.01 218.95 A: uh-huh 

218.82 230.16 B: you know even though it's got the potatoes and onions and stuff in it it's still good on a hot dog so but i i like chilies mostly yeah yeah yeah you have to change it up 

223.08 224.09 A: sure 

224.37 225.25 A: sure 

225.97 228.12 A: you can be creative with it 

228.45 230.83 A: and make other things with it then 

230.51 237.44 B: yeah y- you have to change it up because [sigh] you know green chili for a week 

231.28 232.35 A: okay 

237.45 241.53 B: you know big old crock pot for one person [laughter] you know 

238.80 248.51 A: [laughter] you gotta make it stretch out and last a while for everybody or i mean that it is going to do that anyway huh 

242.24 244.04 B: (( i- yeah )) 

245.00 246.62 B: (( yeah it's the )) 

247.69 249.26 B: yeah

268.92 278.41 A: um oh my goodness there's so many things there's too many things that i like to eat ah as far as a favorite goes it's difficult to say 

274.52 275.58 B: uh-huh

290.22 292.35 B: yeah 

291.41 301.71 A: and everybody brings ah different things and i've got one man there that um his specialty is ah ribs 

301.60 306.96 A: and he he brings the best barbeque ribs you can ever eat and um 

301.64 303.44 B: oh man yeah

309.98 310.94 B: uh-huh 

313.66 323.30 A: and ah so these country cooks can really oh it's just unreal what they can fix and it is so wonderful 

319.70 320.82 B: mhm 

323.17 332.89 A: and so that's why i i'm having to to cut down on [laughter] things so [laughter] so i won't get awa- way from me here eating those wonderful things 

327.31 328.42 B: (( [laughter] )) 

332.19 334.05 B: yeah well 

332.86 339.09 A: but ah as far as eating out i like to go to dallas and eat out at several places there 

338.87 339.91 B: mhm 

339.21 340.44 A: um 

340.56 354.77 A: i i you know there's so many ah the outback and you know i could just name so many different places that i enjoy eating but when i got there i think eating at my sister's and eating there at her home
