245.02 246.65 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

255.10 260.47 B: right e- now you're right about that and and that's my dilemma as well because 

260.94 266.77 B: i i found the same thing i mean there's no restaurant that i know of that 

266.92 271.10 B: has low fat low sodium low cholesterol food 

270.52 278.55 A: right subway go- they come close ah um we really and they're good we like subs from subway and they're 

278.75 283.19 B: except the meat is processed which means it's high in sodium 

280.72 286.95 A: well that's true unless you just get the veggies if you if just get the if you're gonna go vegetarian i guess 

287.08 287.93 A: um 

287.34 291.01 B: but even that you know even that that vegetarian um 

291.45 294.41 B: with the veggie um burger that they have 

294.70 296.70 B: it's pretty high in sodium 

296.03 297.25 A: is it 

296.93 298.03 B: yeah 

297.30 298.31 A: (( is it )) 

298.18 303.14 B: so unless and even if you get the vegetables i mean like you know the peppers or 

303.70 305.50 B: if you know they're um 

305.83 313.98 B: the canned peppers or in the bottle or whatever those are high in sodium as well like pickled type vegetables yeah 

308.21 309.16 A: oh yeah oh 

311.84 313.09 A: (( all right right )) 

313.13 313.91 A: right 

314.01 323.50 B: so [laughter] you almost have to cook at home if you're going to stick to a low sodium low fat low cholesterol diet 

316.64 317.29 A: (( your )) 

317.30 318.42 A: (( doomed )) 

323.13 327.60 A: and then it's like cardboard [laughter] well you just flavor it 

325.44 328.93 B: i don't think it has to be though because 

327.82 329.69 A: (( no i know )) 

329.11 333.74 B: yeah i i actually you know like i sometimes cook um 

333.89 347.02 B: turkey turkey legs you know the turkey drumsticks and just boil them season them well my doctor was telling me 'cause i have the same problem you know low ah high cholesterol ah hypertension 

336.82 337.75 A: right 

346.65 347.68 A: right 

347.06 355.31 B: and she was telling me that [cough] you um that you you really have you need to cook at home because the only way you're gonna 

355.65 359.96 B: stay on that low fat low salt you know low cholesterol diet 

360.08 361.88 B: is to cook at home 

361.63 362.46 A: right 

362.21 365.90 B: [noise] because [cough] most restaurants [noise] 

368.04 372.59 B: you have a few of 'em that that you know they claim to have low fat foods 

372.82 375.41 A: right but you really don't know what's in it 

374.90 379.56 B: you really don't if you don't cook it [noise] in it so 

379.64 383.37 B: and they're more concerned about taste than they are about 

382.77 383.75 A: right 

383.63 386.02 B: ah giving you a healthy 

385.29 386.33 A: right 

386.11 388.82 B: hea- giving healthy healthy food so 

388.09 389.70 A: that's for sure 

389.57 394.87 B: yeah so it i mean that makes makes a lot of sense but i actually prefer 

395.19 399.71 B: to eat at home to be honest but i do like eating out too 

400.30 407.08 A: i think most people are that way i mean i we are we you know like you say it gets tiring to eat out just 

406.83 407.67 B: [noise] 

408.13 417.98 B: well because when you go out you gotta wait you [sigh] first of all if you go to a popular restaurant you're sitting there and sometimes i've been in situations where i'm waiting for 

418.47 430.15 B: or other people are waiting for the table and the waitress keeps coming back filling up my jar [laughter] you know that actually irritates me after a while because when i'm drinking coffee 

420.91 422.22 A: (( gets right )) 

425.33 426.02 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

430.13 441.74 B: and i get it just the way i want it you know i don't like coffee extremely hot and then i put a little you know put my creamer in it and i use ah sweet and low or whatever 

434.82 435.99 A: right 

441.52 454.35 B: sugar substitute get that just right and then the waiter comes along and fills my cup up again [laughter] they think they're doing me a favor but they actually they're actually not 

447.95 448.69 A: [laughter] 

454.06 459.25 A: they always come along when i have my mouth full and say how is everything mm [laughter] 

457.06 458.74 B: [laughter] 

459.92 461.47 B: yeah that too 

462.88 469.81 B: [noise] but yeah there's i mean there's just a a number of different things that just kinda irk me abou- about that whole experience but 

470.36 475.73 B: i mean i i do i like eating out though but like i said it it gets kinda old [noise] 

475.28 476.14 A: it 

476.86 479.48 A: it does what ah 

478.46 479.05 B: (( [noise] )) 

479.59 481.36 A: and when my kids were 

481.41 483.61 A: were small when they were home 

483.72 497.58 A: of course it was we didn't eat out too often it was mainly it was mainly home cooking most of the time and i was very blessed in that i didn't have to work outside so i was home i was a stay at home mom and 

495.44 498.64 B: mhm 

497.88 507.04 A: so i got to have [sigh] something ready for them when they came home from school and you know a good supper going and then on the table so i didn't have to 

507.06 508.50 A: rely on the 

508.66 511.85 A: convenience [sigh] throw it together in two minutes [laughter] 

511.43 512.62 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

511.96 516.69 A: although sometimes i did you know you buy things like that but um 

516.95 518.52 A: but basically 

518.65 523.62 A: it was and i had to real- i didn't know how to cook when we got married 

523.53 524.57 B: mm 

524.18 538.81 A: [laughter] my husband bought me a betty crocker cookbook and he said he said i like to eat i don't like to eat outta cans i don't like t._v. dinners we're not going out all the time and we're not eating at your mother's [laughter] 

538.67 540.20 B: [laughter] well you know it was [noise] 

539.12 540.39 A: and i'm not cooking 

542.97 548.68 B: you know what was what was ah funny in my situation though was that when i was growing up 

548.73 556.18 B: i never did any very much cooking at home other than the only cooking i can remember doing when i was in college and that 'cause i went to school at 

556.34 560.29 B: in ah in my home town you know with and stayed at my parents' house 

559.45 560.39 A: right 

560.31 563.99 B: for the last two years i went the first two years i went away 

564.11 565.40 B: but um 

565.63 572.83 B: i never did very much cooking except maybe scrambling an egg here or there here and there and you know maybe doing the sausage the bacon 

569.38 570.34 A: right 

572.90 584.06 B: real simple breakfast food generally but i actually learned i you know i was always you know real close to my mom and i used to sit in kitchen and talk to her all the time while she was cooking 'cause she was like you 

584.21 586.06 B: a stay at home mom 

585.47 586.38 A: mhm 

586.25 595.43 B: and um that's really how i learned to cook i mean there were a lot of things that i had never cooked before and just from watching her 

595.88 598.06 B: i remember how she did it 

597.46 599.89 A: you do you learn an awful lot just from
