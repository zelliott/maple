113.60 115.92 B: right 

114.52 115.88 A: (( yeah so um )) 

116.53 123.40 A: but occasionally we do get to go out and i apologize i'm getting laryngitis so if it's hard for you to hear me that's why 

121.86 124.76 B: oh no that's okay i can understand you fine 

124.73 125.82 A: okay good 

126.33 130.39 B: well what how old are your kids

137.51 139.72 B: yeah 

137.81 143.97 A: um my daughter is a big mcdonalds fan um my son is more taco belle

145.30 147.41 A: yeah he loves taco belle 

149.68 154.12 A: well considering it i wouldn't call it real mexican food you know what i mean 

153.43 160.62 B: well yeah but it's still better than you know mcdonalds or burger king something different 

159.14 161.78 A: yeah it is different but my daughter won't eat it 

162.13 167.21 A: so if if we went to well if my husband went to taco belle to get

181.43 183.26 B: okay 

181.65 186.07 A: but but my reasoning is people that go out to jobs 

186.11 190.02 A: their weekend starts at five o'clock on fridays 

190.17 191.80 A: so mine does too 

191.86 200.48 A: and my husband doesn't my husband doesn't get home 'til six thirty so five o'clock i stop everything which means we eat out friday night saturday

504.16 505.45 B: (( you know the whole )) 

505.62 507.29 B: idea of it 

507.34 509.18 A: (( yeah um some )) 

508.16 510.83 B: with the the subject i mean do they 

510.90 515.02 B: like what do they is it they they're testing our voices is that what they do 

514.94 519.62 A: i have no idea maybe they are looking to see what kind of foods we like 

519.46 521.18 B: yeah huh 

520.04 521.77 A: i i really don't know 

521.36 523.95 B: i wonder if it's like marketing research or 

524.22 525.79 A: (( it's possible but )) 

526.92 527.97 A: but um 

527.39 530.58 B: what other kind of food other than prime ribs do you like 

530.45 542.50 A: um well i like italian food but i don't get to eat that too often um 'cause my son has this life threatening egg allergy and most of the pastas are like home made pastas are made with egg 

541.04 542.60 B: oh right 

542.86 545.92 A: so we're stuck with boxed stuff 

545.57 551.92 B: yeah we have some customers that come in and their children are allergic as well 

551.91 553.60 A: yeah so i mean like 

552.62 555.38 B: and it doesn't seem like they can barely eat anything 

555.42 559.37 A: it it's really hard and that's another reason why like um 

559.47 573.54 A: when we go to georgine's i can't bring my kids well one they wouldn't eat the stuff but two um the only thing that they would have for little ones would be like the chicken fingers and that's dipped in egg before they 

563.70 564.63 B: [noise] 

564.93 565.83 B: (( [noise] )) 

570.97 571.97 B: (( oh okay )) 

573.69 574.96 A: ah bread it 

575.08 577.38 A: and so he wouldn't be able to have that 

575.25 577.24 B: right 

577.29 578.06 B: huh 

577.55 581.45 A: you know and it's just it's really tough you know it 

580.52 581.91 B: yeah 

581.64 584.15 A: and i i feel bad for him because 

584.29 588.68 A: he wants to have different things and he can't have it because there's eggs in it 

588.61 590.12 B: right 

589.64 591.09 A: (( oh but )) 

590.96 593.29 B: now is that hereditary do they say 

593.43 595.35 A: (( no and um it and um )) 

594.40 595.14 B: (( huh )) 

595.37 598.08 A: and it seems to be getting worse too 

597.60 599.95 B: (( [noise] really how old is he now )) 

598.98 599.89 A: yeah
