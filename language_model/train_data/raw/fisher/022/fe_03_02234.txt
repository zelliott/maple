1.24 3.79 B: hi i'm mindy 

3.37 4.54 A: hi mindy 

4.34 5.73 B: [laughter] 

5.03 9.78 A: i guess we go so which do you prefer eating at home or eating in a restaurant 

6.44 7.47 B: okay 

9.62 10.67 B: um 

10.69 14.52 B: well i guess it depends on what i'm eating [laughter] 

13.80 14.87 A: good answer 

14.71 21.43 B: [laughter] if you know i certain restaurants i like but i do like being at home 

21.53 26.54 B: but it is nice to eat at a restaurant because you don't have to clean up afterwards [laughter] 

25.65 30.81 A: good answer do you cook for yourself alone or are there others that you cook for too 

29.69 33.42 B: ah me and my husband yeah 

31.44 35.17 A: yeah and do you consider yourself a good cook 

35.29 37.07 B: um well 

37.37 44.70 B: i think that i'm i'm pretty good i mean i'm not the best but i can whip up a few specialties [laughter] um 

43.47 46.53 A: [laughter] so what's your favorite meal 

47.46 50.81 B: well my favorite meal that's a hard one 

50.73 63.65 B: i i do like roasts you know i us- i make those normally on sundays and i have lots of different recipes for different you know flavorings and stuff but roasts are always a good 

63.61 69.32 B: you know strong [laughter] good meal with mashed potatoes and gravy 

68.72 76.67 A: [mn] good old meat and potatoes fan i see so are you in the midwest perhaps [laughter] oh that's interesting 

69.96 71.54 B: yeah 

73.81 75.72 B: i'm not [laughter] 

76.20 82.32 B: i'm just used to it it was our kind of our family dinner on sunday so that's probably why we 

80.18 81.13 A: oh that's nice 

82.68 85.40 B: we really like it but yeah 

84.83 86.95 A: oh that's a good tradition to be in 

86.75 87.92 B: (( ah )) 

87.22 96.08 A: i ah when i cook it is usually for my two kids unless my husband happens to be home from work at a reasonable hour which is fairly rare 

93.45 94.42 B: [laughter] 

95.21 96.24 B: [laughter] 

95.85 104.17 A: so it's kind of like i can throw pretty much anything in front of them and the more time and effort i seem to put into something the less they actually like it so 

102.64 105.69 B: [laughter] oh that's funny 

105.28 114.62 A: well then i suppose that'll happen till they're a little bit older but now there's just nothing better than mac and cheese that comes out of a box so i just you know 

108.17 109.53 B: yeah 

112.08 113.06 B: [laughter] 

114.39 121.27 A: if i actually tried to make macaroni from scratch that just wouldn't be as good you know kind of like why bother 

118.53 119.67 B: yeah 

120.76 122.62 B: yeah that's true 

122.17 126.01 A: but the you know weekend meals when we've all got a bit more time 

125.63 127.47 B: yeah 

126.29 129.63 A: then it's nice to invest a little bit more into that i suppose 

129.56 134.56 B: yeah that's kind of the same with me i i cook more in the weekends 'cause after work i'm 

134.86 138.27 B: kind of tired i tend to do things that are easy 

138.29 141.05 B: i really like desserts i'm a kind of 

140.74 141.99 A: really 

141.97 146.65 B: yeah i love cooking baking and making desserts 

146.20 149.11 A: my i'm impressed [laughter] 

148.09 151.21 B: they just taste a lot better than everything else 

151.05 158.25 A: well that's true but that's actually why i like i you know if given a choice i mean depending on you know the day of the week and what we've been up to 

152.20 153.23 B: (( [laughter] )) 

157.68 158.83 B: (( mhm )) 

158.28 161.58 A: it's so nice just to be able to go out to a restaurant because 

162.11 171.40 A: i mean again especially with kids they get to choose what i like i get to eat something that maybe i wouldn't normally cook at home and um you know 

168.83 170.19 B: yeah 

171.61 185.76 A: i can go a little bit beyond meat and potatoes like i actually had a date this weekend so we went to a thai restaurant and it's like it is [laughter] like wow you know something beyond um 

174.52 175.81 B: yeah 

178.72 180.94 B: oh that's nice 

185.72 188.69 A: macaroni and cheese [laughter] 

187.04 193.62 B: yeah [laughter] well i love i love pasta i love making pastas 

192.93 194.15 A: (( yeah definitely )) 

193.82 204.46 B: i'm real creative and and i like to just try different things and my husband's real easygoing he'll eat anything so that makes it easy to cook [laughter] 

201.27 202.74 A: (( yeah amen )) 

204.04 216.40 A: no kidding yeah that those were the easy days when you kind of got to experiment and play around and it's interesting to talk to you and realise how much my cooking habits have changed how similar that is for other ah 

207.95 210.19 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

213.23 214.64 B: [laughter] 

216.66 219.76 A: families i guess to kind of go through that cycle 

219.38 221.82 B: yeah i'm sure it will be and we 

222.01 227.72 B: i just you know when we first got married i was like this will be so fun i get to cook and 

225.86 229.66 A: [laughter] somebody else gets to eat it mhm 

228.89 234.73 B: yeah i know and i still i i love to cook it's just time you know and 

235.25 240.82 B: and and my husband you know we have a deal that when i cook he cleans up so that's nice 

240.37 241.91 A: good answer yes 

242.46 248.09 A: absolutely so are you um like a cookbook type of person or are you more of an experimenter 

247.50 250.16 B: [laughter] um well i 

250.53 256.06 B: i use recipes that i get from people that you know have tried it and know that it's good 

255.32 257.47 A: (( oh really that's an interesting idea )) 

256.44 258.04 B: (( yeah i don't )) 

258.16 261.38 B: i don't really tend to go for the cookbooks just because 

262.35 268.19 B: i've tried you know a couple that people have given me and stuff and they never turn out that good 

267.79 268.69 A: mhm 

268.35 272.96 B: and you know i have a lot of good friends that love to cook and so 

272.69 274.05 A: oh good answer 

273.68 275.38 B: i get more 

275.60 278.21 B: ideas from them and then 

277.20 277.97 A: sure 

278.34 281.34 B: then i know that it'll turn out good 

280.30 283.19 A: sure well my staple was always um 

283.33 290.25 A: when i was first employed i worked for the company and they do you know a little monthly booklet cookbook thing 

286.02 287.13 B: oh 

289.86 290.91 B: uh-huh 

290.87 296.97 A: i'm sure you've seen on grocery store shelves they're general mills now but and that was so easy because i 

292.31 293.57 B: yeah 

294.37 295.35 B: uh-huh 

297.13 301.07 A: you know i brought a lot of product home because of my work and you know 

301.27 301.95 A: the 

302.12 312.04 A: the recipes were very easy they had great pictures you know they were all generally like thirty minutes and under and so it was just you know that was kind of like what i did in the beginning you know 

305.29 306.20 B: uh-huh 

308.51 310.05 B: yeah 

311.52 312.68 B: uh-huh 

312.51 313.85 A: really nice though 

313.70 315.20 B: yeah 

314.58 320.53 A: but i always i'm not like a gourmet magazine type of cookbook person i'm more you know 

320.51 330.01 A: good and you know easy and hardy and i should have been getting a lot of recipes like over the web or something but i like to do kind like theme stuff like whenever we have parties you know 

326.19 327.48 B: yeah 

329.52 330.74 B: uh-huh 

330.69 339.58 A: like a seafood thing and wear i didn't you know grow up cooking seafood i'll go and find some recipes on the web and we we'll have fun that way so 

339.29 347.73 B: yeah that's a good idea well i know like growing up my mom she was a single mom and so she would work all day and 

347.13 348.37 A: mhm 

347.99 359.09 B: never cook to this day i swear she has never cooked anything in her life [laughter] just always well she just like growing up we ate the most random things like cream of wheat all the 

352.14 355.24 A: wow what did you eat [laughter] 

359.37 360.61 B: (( time like )) 

360.07 364.25 A: (( i love cream of wheat [laughter] but for breakfast )) 

361.05 366.67 B: i know we did too yeah [laughter] but i thought we ate it for every meal but 

366.62 367.30 A: (( ah )) 

366.88 373.81 B: we just she never had time to cook and she just never enjoyed cooking and so we would just you know she had a microwave 

370.67 371.65 A: sure 

372.49 379.29 A: it's not terribly rewarding with children have i mentioned that [laughter] yeah yeah i know

403.13 404.38 A: (( uh-huh mhm ))

437.14 438.11 A: yeah 

438.86 448.72 B: why not we'll just go eat out and i don't know maybe it's too because you know when you first start out being married you don't have as much money so you got to be creative and stay home and
