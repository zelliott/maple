197.01 208.57 B: okay where the five and the one okay that's right then i've got that should put it on the map [sigh] well i guess getting back to the topic here in terms of illness it's something that i've spent a lot of time studying my background's in biochemistry 

208.47 214.27 B: and um i've worked with a lot of viruses that are um [lipsmack] light sensitive 

214.31 218.19 B: and so those viruses tend to um proliferate in the spring 

218.20 219.33 A: (( right mhm right mm mhm )) 

218.73 221.89 B: when people come out from their winter hibernation 

222.12 237.01 B: and they're back out in the sun sunlight particularly in the parts of the country that don't get you know as much sun as we get here in in sunny southern california so i know that there are certain viruses chicken pox usually flare up in the kindergarten populations in the spring that's a light sensitive virus persella 

237.36 242.77 B: um there are a couple of other ones herpes simplex a lot of people will say they get ah fever blisters cold blisters 

242.68 243.96 A: right i've heard that

245.00 246.57 A: (( right mhm )) 

245.86 251.28 B: and so that's a seasonal um illness my personal feeling from um 

251.30 252.28 B: not only 

252.62 261.72 B: biochemistry but also just from raising four kids and working on keeping myself healthy is that we've got to strengthen our immune systems what do you think 

261.00 262.20 A: absolutely 

262.41 264.89 B: um do you take supplements to try to do that

325.33 336.37 B: oh well i guess that's a seasonally seasonally reoccurring illness then [laughter] no it's in the chicken you know you know what strengthening your immune system does definitely affect healing those kinds of injuries too 

327.39 328.96 A: [laughter] it is seasonal

390.32 403.69 B: we we support fourteen different philanthropies in our communities and i know we're probably gonna get our hands wet because we're straying from the topic of illness but i was in the emergency room yesterday from one o'clock until seven o'clock with a very dear friend of mine who um 

393.73 394.46 A: (( really really )) 

403.70 415.05 B: i feel still very very um almost shocked that at my good fortune to have been on the phone with her when she collapsed and i heard the phone thump and i was able to call nine one one 

415.19 418.15 B: and get the ambulance over to her right away um 

418.32 425.43 B: so i mean after being in the hospital and observing emergency room technicians for the bulk of the day yesterday 

425.52 429.22 B: i came home really wiped out but completely um 

429.51 432.28 B: committed to the importance of staying healthy 

432.03 433.56 A: (( uh-huh absolutely )) 

433.35 436.78 B: it's just it's so obvious to me my husband is a physician 

436.43 437.29 A: uh-huh 

436.86 440.32 B: and his sub specialty is um endocrinology 

440.46 447.95 B: and um you know endocrine ah is a it's a very interesting sort of specialty because it involves all different areas of metabolic um 

448.08 449.66 B: uh balance 

449.28 450.43 A: right 

449.87 459.46 B: and you know balance to me is the key word so it's tough trying to stay healthy in this uh fast paced age it's also a real um 

452.22 453.12 A: mhm 

459.73 464.82 B: mission i think and i i think you've accomplished it to be able to stay um 

465.20 470.15 B: in the mode of feeding your body whole foods organically grown whole foods 

469.59 473.90 A: oh yeah i mean especially in our culture but it's much easier to have 

474.05 481.92 A: have poor health or a sort of poor health in in any way emotionally visually our environment's so polluted with refuse mhm 

481.90 488.51 B: it's so true i mean it really is and i've been try to get my kids to understand if they start to spinoff from us 

488.44 501.40 B: and establish their own apartments um that you know they've got to be responsible for how they eat and that they should really think when they go to the grocery store to get as much food as they can that does not come in any kind of package 

501.64 505.69 B: you know i just tell them look for food that's packaged as nature packages in 

505.91 508.59 B: and try to stay away from anything that's coming in a 

508.63 511.41 B: microwave safe container [laughter] or can 

510.57 518.59 A: yeah i mean even just the protas the protas are grandparents it does not it's it's not coming from the safe well the ground is not the same ground mm 

517.87 520.60 B: that's right we've depleted our soil 

520.64 526.52 B: and of course we have all these pesticides and we've got all of the things that are taking agriculture to 

523.26 524.08 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

526.75 539.54 B: new lows [laughter] it's really [sigh] it is quite a challenge i mean it i remember back as a child being um in my [mn] um [lipsmack] great aunt's garden and looking at the protas that she grew 

539.60 547.29 B: and thinking my gosh they didn't have this at the local grocery store and tomatoes that just were so sweet that you you really knew they were fruit 

547.05 548.87 A: (( mhm right [laughter] mm )) 

547.78 556.83 B: [laughter] it was really oh i don't know but i i mean there i do believe there is still [mn] the ability for us to stay healthy and to um 

557.15 566.67 B: [lipsmack] you know go with the natural flow of the seasons by looking to see what's um you know what is in season and then making sure that we get enough of that for our bodies 

566.78 567.72 B: (( um )) 

567.94 575.84 B: [mn] there's a few companies that i've been involved with that have come up that have individual products that are unique to those companies and i think that those are 

575.79 589.10 B: very good there are some things that are kind of exotic you wouldn't find them necessarily in the local grocery stores like um puree of the mango steam which is a i don't know if you've ever heard of that it's a very exotic fruit grown in the tropics 

584.24 585.13 A: mhm
