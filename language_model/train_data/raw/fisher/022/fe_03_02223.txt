0.33 1.51 B: (( hello )) 

1.18 2.43 A: hello 

2.41 4.00 B: how's it going [laughter] 

3.73 5.04 A: hi how are you 

5.05 6.27 B: i'm good 

6.11 9.82 A: um do you prefer eating in a restaurant or at home 

10.02 12.82 B: um i like both for different reasons 

12.99 14.01 A: mhm 

13.73 20.45 B: [laughter] i like um i guess mostly i prefer to eat at home but that makes me appreciate eating at a restaurant even more 

20.85 23.13 A: oh that's a good point um 

22.48 23.72 B: how about yourself 

23.64 25.62 A: i i think i 

26.18 33.79 A: do enjoy eating at home more un- unless it's a very special occasion but um i just enjoy being 

33.87 38.56 A: being able to have a more relaxed atmosphere and being able to 

39.13 42.31 A: wear what i want and take as much time as i want and 

40.87 42.44 B: [laughter] 

42.43 55.83 A: and ah yeah you know being able to get up and do something that might be distracting me around the house as long as my dining partners don't mind right exactly and um i tend to do that a lot too to probably save time 

47.93 50.43 B: yeah multi task while you eat 

55.86 57.36 A: um but 

57.94 69.03 A: then again there are probably like i wouldn't want to cook for myself on my birthday or something like that since i'm the one who does the majority of the cooking in my house it would fall to me so 

62.79 64.79 B: yeah yeah 

69.72 77.14 B: well i think also another thing is about eating at home is eating with other people when everyone's like helping to make it or whatever and it becomes like a 

77.10 90.43 B: social event and everyone's like doing their own part to like put their hands and energy into the food or whatever and put it on the table and like take the time to go through it instead of being rushed at a restaurant which i guess like you can take your time there too but just like 

90.29 94.60 B: you go there you get the menu you sit down you read it you know whatever it's just like very 

95.04 96.61 B: routine you know 

96.07 97.79 A: right right 

96.84 110.81 B: whereas like if you can hang out at home with friends or family or whatever and everyone like takes part in it and makes it like a really like a valuable experience that i guess i could take for granted but i don't know i think that like a lot of people don't interact as much as they could over food and it's such a cultural thing 

110.95 122.27 A: that's very true i can't say i've been successful in getting others to participate with me but on the rare occasions that has um yeah that's that's really an excellent point and it's a community venture 

116.02 116.74 B: [laughter] 

122.45 128.56 B: yeah and i think there a lot of other cultures take you know the preparation of food um it's like such a 

128.43 137.99 B: a normal daily thing that you know a lot of other people interact with each other so much more over that and like in the kitchen and it's like a so- social environment whereas 

137.21 138.18 A: right 

138.15 146.04 B: eating in a restaurant i mean i just love eating in a restaurant and having someone else do it for me and have them make things that i've no idea how to do [laughter] 

145.96 153.39 A: right right that's that's a good point too i always think wow i would really love to do that but i could never never pull it off or 

154.03 156.74 A: wanting to know how they do it i ah 

156.88 161.68 A: like like the food network in awe for reasons like that [laughter] um 

160.84 161.99 B: (( yeah definitely )) 

162.59 173.32 A: uh i guess the other part of the question was describe your perfect meal i've been trying to think about that in the back of my mind and i'm having trouble coming up with ah what that might be 

173.23 174.75 B: a perfect meal 

174.29 175.65 A: a perfect meal 

175.78 176.67 A: um 

179.52 180.20 B: (( [noise] )) 

180.50 184.36 A: what you said about having people around i mean that would you know 

184.61 190.68 A: that would be part of it certainly um without even identifying what the particular food items might be 

190.54 191.51 B: mhm 

191.08 192.00 A: um 

195.38 196.21 A: i guess 

195.61 196.38 B: i guess 

196.57 200.07 A: i'm sorry please go ahead [laughter] 

198.29 202.25 B: [laughter] um i guess ah 

202.29 205.87 B: a close to perfect meal for me would definitely be um 

206.30 207.51 B: daytime 

207.56 211.20 B: bunch of people participating and making the food lots of 

211.57 214.83 B: good produce happening and um 

213.58 214.60 A: mhm 

215.03 218.99 B: like salads and vegetables and whatnot and um 

219.12 220.70 B: eating outside 

220.84 222.00 B: and 

221.40 222.89 A: (( mhm )) 

222.04 225.37 B: um definitely a really exciting dessert [laughter] 

225.64 238.15 A: oh i would i would choose part of that the opposite um i really dislike eating outside so mine would definitely take place indoors i just don't want any wind or bugs or anything in my way so [laughter] 

231.48 232.48 B: really 

233.63 234.39 B: (( uh-huh )) 

236.98 238.98 B: [laughter] 

238.60 248.71 A: even when i i barbecue outside i often bring the food inside to eat it [laughter] which probably defeats the purpose a little bit but um yeah i hadn't really thought about location 

248.78 251.81 A: um yeah for me the perfect meal would definitely be 

252.24 257.45 A: inside but most likely in in my house as opposed to a restaurant 

257.79 259.83 B: what about like what's a favorite meal 

260.69 261.71 A: um 

261.76 263.58 A: (( i don't know if i have a particular )) 

264.14 266.98 A: dish but um anything with 

267.35 272.90 A: with cheese and sauce whether that be italian or other mediterranean will always work for me 

274.04 275.05 B: (( really good )) 

275.07 275.76 A: um 

275.80 277.21 A: you mentioned ah 

277.45 281.10 A: finishing things off with a perfect dessert do you have a favorite one in mind 

281.02 284.44 B: [laughter] a favorite dessert um anything involving chocolate 

282.12 283.18 A: mhm 

284.79 288.87 A: yeah that always works out pretty well [laughter] um 

286.23 288.58 B: [laughter] 

289.71 293.35 A: and uh with cherries or strawberries makes it even better 

293.77 301.88 B: yeah my friend used to have something against um eating something with fruit in it for dessert because she says it doesn't count as dessert but i don't know if you do it right i think it can 

301.62 304.43 A: oh yes absolutely [laughter] 

305.40 306.32 A: um 

307.65 314.10 A: goodness i thought this topic would be very easy to talk about um since i love food so much [laughter] 

311.61 312.57 B: [laughter] 

313.44 315.88 B: [laughter] my attitude definitely [laughter] 

315.02 316.07 A: (( and um )) 

317.14 323.59 A: people ask you know you know what's your what's your you know what's your favorite food what do you like my answer is you know food 

323.69 324.95 B: yeah 

324.15 326.21 A: i can't really think of anything i 

326.50 327.77 A: i won't eat 

327.71 335.00 B: i don't have a like one favorite but on my um top favorites is definitely carrots are in there i

350.63 354.50 B: [laughter] well i'm from california [laughter] 

353.49 356.29 A: [laughter] well maybe you do [laughter] but um

356.99 360.45 A: i mean that's all great stuff i'm not a big fan of 

360.74 362.77 A: meat myself but ah 

363.33 369.18 B: yeah i haven't eaten meat in a long time but i'm sure that if i started again that would definitely be on my top list but it's been so long so 

368.94 370.00 A: mhm 

371.11 372.11 A: right 

371.55 377.91 B: so uh what other part of the question was there or was it just do you like eating at a restaurant or at home or and what's your 

376.31 377.21 A: right 

378.15 380.37 B: perfect meal was that the only two 

378.38 381.05 A: right right i think those were the 

381.18 382.36 A: the only two 

382.72 383.75 B: um 

382.73 383.66 A: um 

385.87 387.75 B: we can talk about 

387.83 388.98 B: um 

390.44 392.10 B: (( what i don't know )) 

392.75 393.63 A: um 

393.36 395.07 B: thinking [laughter] 

394.39 395.52 A: [laughter] 

396.97 401.49 B: um what was the last restaurant experience you had that was nice 

401.50 403.94 A: oh that's a good one question um 

405.00 407.12 A: that was nice oh i gotta 

408.08 420.99 A: i guess it's just good to go to a place that would be far more expensive than i would ever choose on my own and ah while it was not an environment i was accustomed to and therefore not particularly comfortable in it was 

421.05 428.17 A: just a really nice experience to have that 'cause- probably it may be once every ten years would be able to afford something 

427.58 428.57 B: yeah 

428.38 431.82 A: that nice and um it was just that everything was 

432.55 433.85 A: perfect from 

434.39 436.39 A: start to finish from when 

436.92 438.07 A: (( you know just )) 

438.29 440.06 A: the atmosphere and 

440.44 441.93 A: the food and the 

441.94 443.79 B: what made the atmosphere good 

442.26 443.29 A: waiters 

443.86 444.84 A: i'm sorry 

444.61 446.39 B: what made the atmosphere good 

446.35 447.26 A: um 

448.81 450.05 A: it was 

450.28 453.34 A: elegant without being pretentious [laughter] um 

453.58 455.88 A: the the staff were 

456.04 459.90 A: attentive without being in your face [laughter] that's what i often find at 

459.83 460.81 B: mhm 

460.29 464.79 A: expensive restaurants i don't like if they're there too much to clean the crumbs off your table 

464.54 467.66 B: mhm yeah or they're always on your your back like 

465.22 466.23 A: [laughter] 

467.25 468.28 A: right 

467.71 472.69 B: as soon as you've finished your last drink of water they're filling it again which is really nice but it's kinda too much 

472.07 473.14 A: mhm 

473.07 474.04 B: yeah 

473.70 474.56 A: so 

474.67 477.03 A: it was a little more laid back than that so 

477.09 478.56 A: i really enjoyed that 

479.82 480.76 A: um 

480.51 482.25 B: was that for your birthday or something 

482.40 483.30 A: um 

483.74 485.12 A: actually it was kind of a 

485.22 489.14 A: random act of kindness so that made it even more special that it ah 

489.24 494.48 A: it wasn't necessarily for a particular event just kind of a just because kind of thing 

493.76 495.78 B: yeah that's nice 

495.77 498.53 A: um did you have one in mind as well 

498.46 499.59 B: um 

500.05 510.95 B: i'm trying to think of when my last really good restaurant experience was i think it was i had a friend visiting in town and we were trying to figure out where we should eat and we thought we should eat at a restaurant that we'd never 

511.10 518.76 B: eaten at before and so we picked one we picked a thai restaurant called yum yum bangkok just because it was called yum yum bangkok [laughter] we thought that was funny 

516.91 518.71 A: [laughter] 

518.75 530.14 B: and so when we got there i really thought i'd actually already eaten at that restaurant and there's an indonesian restaurant across the street so we spontaneously went from our what we thought was a spontaneous decision to the restaurant across the street 

529.81 530.97 A: that's great 

530.13 530.87 B: the 

530.82 535.17 B: indonesian place and it was really really really good like the 

534.32 535.51 A: [laughter] 

534.99 547.18 B: food was excellent and it was like kind of service where it's not too much in your face and not too unattentive and um i don't know that i'd ever eaten indonesian fo- food before but everything i ate was so good 

547.42 552.61 A: wow i- i'm pretty sure i i haven't eaten that cuisine before but um 

552.94 557.77 A: (( thai food um is very good i enjoy thai food very much )) 

556.29 567.81 B: yeah it was almost it was close to thai food it wasn't anything like shocking oh my god i've never had this before it was kind of a fusion of various other you know asian foods but i'd definitely recommend it it was really good 

561.19 562.23 A: mhm 

569.10 573.81 B: and i ate at a french cafe recently that was surprisingly really really really good too 

574.07 575.60 A: why was it surprising 

575.78 578.83 B: um i don't know i thought it was going to be kind of like 

578.92 587.12 B: posh like too posh and too expensive and like one of those places where they give you a giant plate with a tiny piece of food on it you know and it costs like fifteen dollars 

581.07 582.16 A: mhm 

585.34 586.67 A: right 

586.99 596.21 B: but um it was it wasn't over priced for what it was at all and it was just like everything about it was just like you could tell that they took a lot of care developing 

587.01 588.09 A: right 

596.30 599.95 B: you know their foods and stuff and they used like really like
