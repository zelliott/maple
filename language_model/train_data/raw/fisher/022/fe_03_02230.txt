2.14 4.03 A: my name is jonathan may 

4.05 5.70 B: how are you doing jonathan 

5.39 7.09 A: (( pretty good how are you all right )) 

6.55 11.16 B: i'm doing very well um the topic i suppose is food 

10.65 11.62 A: (( yes )) 

11.28 12.35 B: right 

11.71 15.39 A: and do you prefer eating at a restaurant or at home etcetera 

15.52 18.12 A: so what about you where do you prefer eating 

18.25 26.84 B: i guess it depends it it depends you know how i'm feeling um generally i think it's um to be out 

26.61 27.46 A: yeah 

26.86 29.20 B: basically to be out 

27.47 38.65 A: i i agree i like to eat at a restaurant um in general i like it's like one of the two things i like to spend my money on the other is travel but i i really like to go to nice restaurants and um 

38.68 49.57 A: i can get food that i i couldn't normally or wouldn't normally choose to make at home i i typically order like the fish or steak because i generally just make chicken at home myself 

49.87 56.78 B: right right and it gives you a chance to try things that you couldn't possibly make at home anyways 

56.25 58.14 A: right or wouldn't think to 

58.38 67.00 A: like things with corn meal and crusting i went to a portuguese restaurant just the other night and it was really phenomenal they just did made stuff with 

67.04 74.41 A: interesting sausages that i just ah would never have thought to make and which were wonderful little appetizers right 

74.58 79.66 B: right and and it gives you a chance to sample like you say you know portuguese you can sample 

79.70 89.27 B: many cuisines of the world and um you know you can get an introduction and um maybe it can entice you to want to go to that place 

88.91 89.98 A: right 

90.67 92.50 B: and now um 

92.79 93.76 B: (( the )) 

93.76 99.99 B: going back um but there are times when i like to entertain and be at home um mostly on the weekends 

99.81 108.84 B: but the qualifier there is that i can't get the food to taste as good as the restaurants you can get the recipes from the restaurants 

108.85 111.70 B: um say and 

110.61 111.95 A: you can do that really 

111.82 120.75 B: well not at every single one but sometimes you can um and they'll give you the sort of things but they'll always leave out one crucial ingredient 

113.87 114.69 A: uh-huh 

115.60 116.33 A: (( oh )) 

120.11 121.59 A: (( right that you need )) 

121.09 126.61 B: or not crucial but something small that gives it that extra something and it doesn't quite taste the same 

126.32 129.13 A: i found that in a lot of cookbooks that are made by famous 

129.16 142.17 A: restaurateurs that ah they have ways of keeping you from really getting their recipe just right and i think well part of that is that they make assumptions that being master chefs and having large restaurants where they would make what you wouldn't necessarily make yourself 

142.13 144.04 B: right right exactly 

142.60 144.46 A: there are certain foods though 

144.24 158.99 A: that i think i only will eat at home and prefer them at home one of them is chili um it's difficult to find a good chili i think outside of aside from like family recipes i haven't and i've been to haven't had too much success at 

158.83 163.69 A: restaurants maybe i'm a chilidog you know but then you're not really going for the chili 

162.00 163.13 B: right 

163.74 166.82 A: often meatloaf i just don't really trust meatloaf 

167.87 169.56 B: in in a restaurant 

168.97 174.82 A: yeah i mean it's such a home food anyway like if you're going to a restaurant why are you going to bother with the meatloaf 

174.80 178.71 B: that's true [laughter] that's true um 

178.75 182.14 B: going back to the chili thing i guess it depends also on 

182.23 188.10 B: if you are referring to an east coast ah south or a west coast chili now 

188.11 189.54 B: i was raised 

188.36 189.77 A: i don't know the difference 

189.98 202.71 B: actually out here in the west in the rocky mountain west or the southwest i should say there's no beans or meat it's basically or there is meat it's pork and it's green chili it's basically 

191.39 192.20 A: uh-huh 

196.25 197.05 A: oh 

200.92 208.46 A: oh yes i've heard about that i saw a t._v. show about the about chili cook off and they had like a green chili kind of sub competition 

208.41 219.07 B: right right it's fantastic it's really good i mean coming from the east going west i would ask for chili and they would i would ask where the beans were and they just would laugh [laughter] 

209.51 210.33 A: (( really )) 

218.05 220.70 A: uh so you're from the east originally 

220.30 221.94 B: ah midwest actually 

221.23 228.05 A: oh midwest yeah i'm from that's where i am right now actually yeah yeah so our i'm in massachusetts 

224.39 225.45 B: (( oh really )) 

227.77 228.81 B: oh okay 

228.37 241.88 A: i'm in the the sort of food yeah the chili that we pretty much g- grew up with is a you know ground beef and and dark red kidney beans um green chili is just completely foreign to me 

236.28 237.44 B: right 

238.35 239.38 B: sure 

241.29 254.54 B: yeah you should give it a try like if you're in albuquerque or denver it's really actually they call it the green chili trail from denver to albuquerque and you can find some nice little places off the highways you know if you just go off on a highway off off the main highway 

253.72 255.10 A: (( mm right )) 

254.46 260.87 B: and get in some good towns you know sante fe or or or or something that you can find some really nice places 

260.44 262.52 A: what makes the chili green 

262.72 267.81 B: ah the green chilies i don't i don't i don't exactly what um 

264.01 265.20 A: oh okay 

267.91 271.58 B: the type of chili is my buddy is a um fireman sorry 

271.63 278.87 B: in denver and every year they have a chili cook off for for charity and he's you know something of a master 

278.60 279.43 A: (( oh )) 

279.62 283.95 B: um cook as far as that goes 

282.51 285.12 A: is the point to make the chili spicy or just 

284.29 289.89 B: [laughter] yeah yeah he makes it spicy i mean you you can sort of vary it but he makes it very spicy 

289.85 303.75 B: and he i i think the best thing would be to is to fire roast um the chilies themselves and like i said he didn't know the name of them and i i don't think they might be anaheim chilies but i'm not certain it's sort of a light green 

299.49 301.60 A: (( mm )) 

304.32 308.55 B: um yeah it's a sort of a light green chili but it's very tasty 

306.56 307.77 A: yeah in fact 

308.14 317.72 A: in the chili that like i make for example we don't even have there aren't really whole chili peppers in it all the only to the only degree that there is chilies is just chili powder 

318.08 323.83 A: which isn't all that spicy even so i think there is probably better chilies out there than the stuff that we make at home but 

318.14 319.82 B: right 

319.97 320.97 B: yeah 

323.72 330.56 B: that's the kind i grew up with too and i i love it i do like that you know the kidney beans and you know it's very tasty very tasty 

328.59 329.46 A: right 

330.66 338.68 B: um before we run out of time i suppose the second topic was describe your ideal meal 

337.24 350.85 A: oh oh yeah ideal f- mm well um i would say it definitely has a lot to do with atmosphere um i really like um you know something that has a complete meal with an appetizer and then eventually dessert and obviously a good main course 

350.70 355.70 A: um i would say um i i love a nice r- rare tuna steak 

355.77 356.67 B: (( mm )) 

355.78 364.54 A: that's seasoned very well um with maybe a nice salad or perhaps something i don't know some sort of sausage or something as an appetizer and then 

357.38 358.41 B: very nice 

364.64 367.63 A: ah i i'm always partial to creme brule i 

367.79 373.29 A: know they have it at every restaurant which is good for me 'cause i like it with with a with a 

367.79 369.25 B: (( [laughter] )) 

371.48 374.11 B: (( yeah you get to compare huh )) 

373.99 377.43 A: nice thick espresso i think at the end how about yourself 

376.44 383.94 B: oh that sounds that sounds great actually um i guess i'm thinking of a of a nice italian place um 

384.17 394.91 B: you know i lived in chicago for eight years and um go to little italy down there and have a nice you know a simple salad maybe with some ruggela or maybe just like a de presse you know with 

395.09 402.77 B: just really nice beef steak tomatoes ah some you know what it is and a mozzarella and um 

401.50 403.07 A: mm 

403.03 406.41 B: maybe just a a simple pasta maybe um 

405.24 405.99 A: yeah 

406.66 415.03 B: the the dish is actually is is escaping me at the moment um it's it's seafood it's got a bunch of 

415.18 416.11 B: oh 

415.27 417.24 A: yeah clutinesto or something or 

417.20 421.77 B: no no it's oh it's on the tip of my tongue it's um 

421.84 424.36 B: (( tu tu temarie yeah )) 

422.96 425.03 A: (( oh tu tu fridetema tu )) 

425.84 427.65 A: tu temarie or something like that 

426.80 430.47 B: (( yeah you're right you're right frutitemarie )) 

427.71 428.67 A: (( you )) 

429.56 435.67 A: get like it's got the clams and the oysters and the yeah that's right i've had that before 

432.26 433.95 B: (( yeah )) 

434.24 435.43 B: yes 

435.87 441.24 B: and maybe you know a tiramisu and of course um a you know a cappuccino 

440.84 441.70 A: so 

441.81 443.54 B: but that's a lot of food 

442.64 444.53 A: have you eaten in italy before then 

444.67 445.96 B: yes i have 

445.40 454.68 A: oh 'cause you sound it sounds like you're describing a lot of meals i had the summer i was travelling in italy and boy i just ate great all the time my my my friend his 

450.18 451.68 B: oh is that right 

452.52 453.53 B: (( ah )) 

454.63 461.82 A: family is from sicily and we went there and ate his family's food and it's just the food is just tremendous there 

456.44 458.10 B: oh fantastic 

460.93 462.86 B: oh wow 

462.43 469.86 A: it's mostly 'cause it's just coming from the ground you know they pick the figs right off the trees and they they're just heavenly yeah 

467.45 468.54 B: (( oh )) 

469.49 470.92 B: fantastic 

469.98 478.26 A: and but all over italy wherever we ate even in even in like a train station where you wouldn't expect the food to be any good it was still pretty good [laughter] 

477.93 483.96 B: there's something about the tomatoes when i was there and it was probably fifteen years ago i was i stayed above the um 

479.65 480.47 A: yeah 

484.02 499.01 B: the market in venice and every morning i would go downstairs and you know get tomatoes and cheese and bread and just there was something with the tomatoes and i haven't quite i haven't tasted tomatoes like that since and um 

485.42 486.26 A: (( huh )) 

498.79 503.75 B: since i was a child i haven't tasted a tomato quite like that and there's something with 

504.12 513.34 B: you know there there you know the nutrients in the soil you know they lack i think it's the lack of herbicides and things like that that we use way too much of 

507.49 508.25 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

510.32 511.56 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

512.79 515.85 A: yeah that's true um the 

516.17 522.73 A: for me the best the thing that was the most notably different was the coffee and i i've and it's also been the hardest to replicate because 

522.56 531.29 A: i get some of um ah ah my friend's foods 'cause his his relatives live here and they they can do a pretty good approximation of like the brigoli's and the 

531.47 534.47 A: p- just the way they make pasta etcetera but um 

534.61 545.57 A: and i guess it is true that the fresh vegetables are pretty hard to replicate but but getting the coffee right i mean i saw the way they made it and they even gave me a coffee maker so i could try making it myself and i brought back the right coffee 

537.71 539.09 B: right right 

545.46 553.92 A: um but you know they it's just like their espresso is just like it's really thick and it's got this nice little ah little ah what do they call it cream on top 

553.31 557.58 B: yeah the cloudy yeah the really nice cloudy little yeah 

554.40 555.34 A: yeah 

556.45 565.21 A: yeah it just tastes so good and and you know the the biggest reason i want to go back is just to go to those cafes again and 

564.54 579.32 B: oh absolutely absolutely i used to work for a restaurant company in chicago and they they had a certain type of espresso that was the best i've had in america and the name you know escapes me so it really does no good 

576.46 577.23 A: (( oh )) 

578.21 582.76 A: yeah the coffee i brought back was lavasca which is oh is that it okay 

580.59 582.10 B: that's it that's it 

582.23 584.14 B: that was it absolutely 

582.87 583.99 A: i brought back 

584.06 591.65 A: bricks and bricks of it actually but but they my coffee maker actually broke i ah i think i heated it up too much and the rubber 

585.86 588.21 B: is that right 

591.82 594.47 A: kind of warped and i ended up having to throw it away 

594.54 599.89 A: like one of those you know those octagonal metal coffee makers that they used yeah yeah 

594.56 595.73 B: oh wow 

597.94 599.89 B: sure sure i've got one of those
