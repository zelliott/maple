109.66 112.95 A: it's similar to that but much better food 

112.35 125.52 B: well the only thing that i have against that is that i have seen people use their hands you know like t- to pick up say if you go for a breakfast or brunch and they pick sometimes instead of using tongs i have seen like them pick up the sausages or what have you with 

125.43 128.91 B: with their fingers and i'm like oh i don't know where your hands have been 

128.40 129.85 A: oh i see 

129.28 130.54 B: (( you know i'm like buh [noise] )) 

130.47 137.28 A: well i- i- sometimes that might be safer than what's done back in the kitchen too 

136.47 140.47 B: [noise] yes i've we've i've done my share of restaurants when i was younger 

140.06 141.65 A: yeah ah 

140.80 145.91 B: let's see they wanted us to to talk about an ideal meal what's your idea of an ideal meal 

145.51 155.33 A: oh gosh ideal meal would be ah well someone to prepare it at home and clean it up and there's an ideal meal 

151.14 152.04 B: yes 

153.02 153.82 B: (( yeah well )) 

154.90 157.53 B: [laughter] that that's the best part of it mhm 

156.96 161.86 A: ah no i i'm not sure an ideal meal would be ah 

163.14 169.02 A: oh something that ah that the family would enjoy cooked at home 

169.30 170.58 A: (( ah )) 

171.50 176.75 A: you know where it's a it's a full course you know healthy ah 

177.54 185.53 A: if you eat out i suppose again the same thing when you go to a place like chili's or what i mean you've got the menu 

185.12 186.50 B: right 

185.92 190.85 A: but then it's like sometimes you just don't know what you have a mood for and you 

190.37 192.48 B: yes yes we 

190.95 194.81 A: you know well that's where a buffet really does come in handy 

194.21 198.86 B: well you always sure you could try a little bit of everything and then and then the women have to bring a big purse though 

199.11 207.01 A: [noise] well actually i was suprised i was just there ah when did i go last saturday 

207.05 210.15 A: and they have cameras now at this buffet 

210.42 212.84 B: [laughter] for were what were people doing 

211.31 214.47 A: little cameras like at walmart in the ceiling 

213.89 215.10 B: yeah why 

215.30 217.77 A: because people take stuff 

218.15 226.56 B: or i don't i don't see a problem personally with if you've paid for a meal to bring a cookie home for for on your way home or what have you you know what i mean 

226.04 230.88 A: [noise] well i can see a cookie or yes if they give you rolls 

230.30 231.34 B: yeah 

231.25 235.21 A: because that they i think normally just throw those away 

234.75 236.57 B: well yeah i think they have to 

236.22 241.85 A: ah but i guess these people were actually taking stuff 

241.28 243.09 B: oh no that's wrong 

242.56 244.57 A: and filling yeah 

243.99 249.55 B: no you know i i would take a cookie probably even two and wrap it up in a napkin and bring it home 

249.19 250.15 A: yeah 

249.57 258.19 B: now my ideal of a perfect meal of course like you said is somebody to prepare it and clean it up but starting out with a nice salad i like salads my husband doesn't 

257.68 263.84 A: well salads are delicious and and th- that's where buffets really come in handy because 

259.22 260.00 B: yeah 

262.57 265.50 B: yeah but i want a mix of all the different ingredients 

264.15 268.84 A: if you were to buy everything that came on a salad bar 

268.47 269.65 B: oh yes 

269.18 273.15 A: i mean you you would go broke and and the price is reasonable 

272.84 283.33 B: well i wish my husband liked salad bars because i just i well i could eat at a salad bar every day but see i like a good mix of the of the um of the salad greens i like you know 

283.23 288.88 B: more the bitter greens and the sweet greens and even down to just the plain like iceberg lettuce put that on some endive 

289.37 291.99 B: and little this little that but it 

291.02 296.66 A: well that sounds like a mcdonalds commercial because what they're they claiming they have fifteen 

294.83 295.82 B: yeah 

296.87 299.58 A: fifteen kinds of lettuce 

299.32 302.04 B: yeah i like that but i've never had one of theirs 

301.42 305.14 A: i've never did ei- i didn't know there were fifteen types of lettuce [noise] 

304.28 309.68 B: well i i used to buy theirs they used to make a very good um [lipsmack] oh it was like the chefs salad 

309.74 313.70 B: um and then they had great i like the fattening ranch dressing 

313.74 321.41 B: you know and i knew but it used to be very good a lot of meat and a lot of cheese and a lot of the bacon bits and croutons and all that in there 

321.48 322.41 A: right 

321.78 324.46 B: but then then they stopped making it so i don't know 

324.22 328.16 A: i like sort of the wacky dressings the red vinegar 

328.42 330.09 B: sort of the catalina 

328.47 329.59 A: (( the ah )) 

329.82 335.82 A: what no that's too sweet ah this is the red vinaigrette 

332.25 333.27 B: (( okay okay )) 

335.49 336.60 B: okay 

335.96 337.58 A: it's like a ah 

338.66 343.39 A: a well i guess it's like italian but it's it's red and it's it's sorta tangy 

342.41 345.76 B: where they use the red vinegar right sort of like a greek dressing 

344.11 344.83 A: and 

345.38 350.96 A: well that that is good and also the sun dried tomato man that t- 

349.85 351.58 B: yeah that's very good 

351.00 352.92 A: oh that is awesome stuff 

352.28 356.08 B: yes now what about a delicious nice thick
