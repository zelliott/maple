0.06 1.75 B: i'm christina 

1.29 2.87 A: hi i'm dana 

4.15 5.27 B: hi 

6.46 8.66 A: so we're gong to talk about food 

8.85 11.59 B: okay [laughter] 

10.35 23.69 A: that's a tough question about what do you prefer eating out or dining in for me it would depend i like to dine out in that i don't have to cook it and i don't have to clean it up and it might be something that i don't know how to prepare 

14.87 15.94 B: uh-huh 

17.69 18.74 B: right 

20.23 21.46 B: right 

23.54 24.91 B: right 

24.52 30.68 A: i do like that and it's kind of a treat but sometimes it seems like a lot of effort to go out to eat 

25.73 26.79 B: mhm 

30.52 31.95 B: right 

31.63 32.68 A: not to mention 

31.97 41.36 B: well in my opinion i prefer eating out i'm pretty lazy about cooking so i know for sure that when i eat out it's going to be better than anything that i would make 

36.73 37.63 A: are you 

41.47 53.36 B: but i also e- eating in is also pretty pretty nice because then at least you know you save money and ah i don't know sometimes i just i get too lazy to dress up and go out 

48.28 49.33 A: right 

54.01 63.13 A: yeah but sometimes eating out is fun though it does seem like a treat especially if you're going someplace you either really like you know you're really going to like it or maybe something new 

58.25 59.47 B: mhm 

60.69 61.59 B: right 

63.19 64.25 B: right 

64.70 75.15 B: yeah so um i mean like i was watching a thing the other day on t._v. about like the health the health department and um like how 

72.74 73.52 A: uh-huh 

75.20 87.30 B: sometimes the health department doesn't exactly rate them correctly and then they were doing an expose on like restaurants that got i live in l._a. and like they were talking about stuff like readings like you would get an a if you're very clean b. if you're so-so clean 

78.55 79.41 A: oh 

80.67 81.50 A: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

86.15 87.30 A: right 

87.08 100.36 B: and like they were talk they were showing a restaurants the inside and the kitchen it was so disgusting like they they photographed they had like a secret camera and um they photographed people tak- like the chefs taking something out of the garbage and stuff 

100.28 111.87 B: and like it was so disgusting about that and it's like when i eat at home i know that everything that i eat [laughter] is clean you know like i made it if i drop it on the floor i'm not going to eat it [laughter] 

107.75 109.01 A: that's true 

110.31 114.11 A: that's true you have the confidence of knowing your eating was sanitary 

113.79 115.48 B: right exactly 

115.33 123.23 A: yeah that's true i don't think i worry about that too much i mean i've gone into a place and left going ah i don't think so 

118.50 119.51 B: (( yeah )) 

121.15 122.18 B: uh-huh 

123.07 126.83 B: right [laughter] right 

123.87 131.30 A: this doesn't look very clean to me because that's definitely important you could not enjoy a meal too much if if you didn't feel it was um clean 

130.54 132.31 B: right absolutely 

131.31 132.12 A: i think 

132.47 137.02 A: one thing i do like about eating out is that it's always presented really nicely 

136.71 138.34 B: mhm 

137.14 142.70 A: you know it's on a dish and it's arranged so maybe you'd have a little parsley or whatever 

139.47 140.89 B: mhm 

142.43 153.79 B: [laughter] right right right absolutely and like as far as eating out like i also feel like it it's definitely beneficial with nowadays how families don't really 

144.04 145.58 A: nothing that you'd do at home 

153.72 167.86 B: sit down a lot and have dinner together like you have to sit down and eat together if you go to a restaurant you know like you can't go and watch t._v. or play in your room or whatever like you have to do it together and be a family or be together whoever you're with 

158.97 159.97 A: that's true 

162.52 163.76 A: that is true 

166.56 167.35 A: (( that )) 

167.40 173.30 A: that's right because especially after you order and you're sitting there waiting for your meal to be prepared 

169.93 172.04 B: mhm mhm 

172.79 177.38 B: right it's a real social experience more than like sitting at home 

175.55 176.26 A: yes 

178.32 182.79 B: (( yeah i don't know how much more i can talk about this [laughter] )) 

180.21 187.92 A: yeah i do actually like it and it doesn't happen very much when we do go out to dinner with somebody else like you go with another family or go with 

185.58 186.57 B: uh-huh 

187.16 198.44 B: oh yeah absolutely i'm not married i have a boyfriend and like i really enjoy going out to dinner with him like i like staying at home and making stuff but and like it it's fun to make stuff together but i i don't know like 

188.23 189.03 A: (( friends )) 

198.90 203.94 B: i feel i feel i like it better because then it feels more like a real date when you go out 

203.27 205.24 A: sure i can see that 

204.00 215.42 B: you know like like yeah it's fun to have him come over and we can cook together and it's very much a bonding experience but then it's just sort of us hanging out you know like it's not dating it's not us being like 

212.53 213.53 A: yeah 

214.97 215.88 A: right 

215.75 228.10 B: i don't know i'm not sure how to expand on that but right right exactly it's a dress up and look pretty and then go out [sigh] so yeah mhm 

217.81 220.72 A: it's not an everyday thing it's more of a special thing 

226.20 238.04 A: that's true that changes it also i was just thinking you get to go out everybody gets to order what they want assuming it's on the menu it's not like making one meal even like for you and your boyfriend say you really wanted spaghetti and you made it and he's like ugh 

231.40 232.40 B: uh-huh 

235.78 236.70 B: right 

238.10 243.95 A: you know he's not really caring for that you can go out you can order spaghetti he can order a hamburger or whatever he wants 

238.28 240.04 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

242.71 245.00 B: (( right yeah )) 

244.26 252.35 A: that is one thing i really enjoy because there is things my family doesn't necessarily enjoy that i do so if we go out i can like ho i can finally have 

252.75 257.35 A: you know whatever it is vegetarian lasagna or something mhm 

253.65 255.69 B: right right 

256.49 257.29 B: (( and i )) 

257.42 258.23 B: (( also )) 

258.52 272.41 B: i don't know as far as like i am trying to be more health conscious lately like i used to go out all the time to eat like i never cooked and i just feel like i gained so much weight doing that 'cause you don't know what people put in it they can put like ten pounds of butter in it you would have no idea even though it tastes good 

268.45 269.42 A: right 

271.28 272.13 A: sure 

272.28 276.20 B: but y- you're more able to control like what you eat when you cook at home 

276.16 282.38 A: i think that's true and you you know they tend to they give you the full plate of food and it seems like portions are getting bigger 

280.62 281.87 B: mhm 

282.23 283.98 B: oh absolutely 

283.00 289.88 A: and you're just sitting there you have nothing else to do so you just kind of keep eating off your plate unless you make a decision o._k. i'm only eating this much of this 

289.87 291.17 B: right 

290.37 291.38 A: and i'm done 

291.36 295.86 B: right but normally that doesn't happen normally i clean my plate [laughter] 

294.95 298.04 A: well you're busy talking and enjoying yourself and before you know it 

297.95 298.88 B: uh-huh 

298.38 299.73 A: it's happened 

299.35 300.28 B: right 

300.24 306.07 A: yes it is nice at a restaurant 'cause for me i'm married i'm the mom to have a 

304.72 305.68 B: uh-huh 

306.45 314.99 A: ask me is everything okay would you like anything else let me clear that dish for you okay [laughter] 

308.81 310.52 B: [laughter] 

310.63 314.41 B: (( [laughter] )) 

314.70 323.53 B: [laughter] yeah i'm really lazy at washing dishes i had to get an apartment that had a dishwasher [laughter] otherwise we would never have eaten at home 

321.13 322.05 A: oh yes 

323.57 324.66 A: sure 

324.37 325.59 B: yeah 

324.54 337.55 A: but even if it's not made right like say you know i cook something at home for my husband and he doesn't really care for it we try a new recipe and it doesn't taste that well you know that's dinner but in a restaurant if something is not prepared to his satisfaction it's nothing on me 

327.51 328.46 B: mhm 

333.01 333.92 B: right 

337.41 338.44 B: right 

337.42 340.71 A: he can say you know what i we need to send this back 

340.43 343.50 B: right [laughter] 

341.08 346.15 A: 'cause his steak is too rare or what have you you know my feelings aren't hurt 

344.47 345.37 B: uh-huh 

346.01 347.02 B: right 

346.32 347.91 A: i didn't make it 

347.35 351.02 B: [laughter] and he can have exactly what he wants 

350.36 353.18 A: have it the way you want it right 

351.96 353.67 B: right exactly 

354.23 356.18 B: i can really hear that 

356.32 368.07 A: but dining out i think like you said the specialness of it it's different i like the variety just you can go have something different and the ease of it i don't have to cook it or clean it up or shop for it or anything 

360.10 361.30 B: mhm 

362.54 363.56 B: right 

364.88 366.34 B: mhm 

367.85 369.77 B: oh yes absolutely 

368.41 375.63 A: but there is the cost of it like you said and also not knowing well we're going to assume everybody is sanitary but 

375.05 376.38 B: right 

375.75 381.69 A: you know not knowing if i mean yes it could be vegetables but like you said do they saute it in ten pounds of butter or or 

381.29 382.48 B: mhm 

383.12 388.02 A: what would it be now i think they also said what's your favorite meal or what was your 

383.54 384.95 B: yeah 

388.09 394.05 B: oh really okay um like my favorite meal or my favorite kind of cuisine 

395.17 396.30 A: (( i don't remember um )) 

395.21 403.19 B: okay well i can address both my favorite meal would have to be corned beef and cabbage my favorite kind of cuisine is japanese 

400.24 401.09 A: really 

403.37 404.46 A: really 

404.15 405.03 B: (( yeah i )) 

404.85 407.92 A: are those like so far apart from each other or what 

405.45 406.02 B: (( know )) 

406.71 418.74 B: [laughter] yeah i love japanese food i i just think it's unbelievable but it's so expensive that's the problem like i never have japanese food it's like 

417.54 426.63 A: i've only had japanese food a few times i have to say it's not my favorite of the few times that i've had it i actually like all kinds of 

420.16 421.30 B: mhm 

422.79 423.83 B: mhm 

429.83 430.75 B: really 

430.11 432.72 A: foods i don't know i guess my an ideal 

432.97 442.75 A: meal for me if i tried to visualize it is there would be a nice salad with it there would be some very nice vegetable thing on the side some kind of zucchini mushroom and squash something 

442.11 443.09 B: uh-huh 

443.16 447.15 A: that my family doesn't normally like that i could have and probably 

445.92 446.80 B: right 

447.23 450.17 A: (( some kind of yummy pasta )) 

450.31 452.05 B: mhm 

450.46 453.24 A: with a lot of cheese [laughter] on it 

452.22 453.87 B: mhm 

453.79 454.83 A: um 

454.37 455.71 B: yeah 

455.55 457.37 A: and maybe some garlic bread 

457.47 459.56 B: oh yeah 

457.70 459.21 A: or some kind of 

459.28 460.68 A: bread like that 

460.44 461.47 B: uh-huh 

461.20 464.91 A: but then i also i don't know that's a tough one and i don't 

465.73 477.56 A: and i guess that's one thing too about eating at a restaurant is there's all that like if you made spaghetti at home you might not necessarily make garlic bread and make this and make that all the things you would get at a restaurant 

475.82 476.58 B: (( oh )) 

477.42 478.34 B: right 

478.71 480.93 A: which is maybe a good thing but 

481.38 482.35 B: right 

482.48 484.25 A: you wouldn't be having all that 

482.62 490.44 B: garlic bread with the ten pounds of butter that you can't see [laughter] yeah absolutely 

485.66 486.69 A: right 

490.57 493.86 A: yes although sometimes there's certain things i'm not 

494.50 497.58 A: very confident in preparing like seafood 

497.37 502.05 B: uh-huh oh yeah oh me neither i cook it for ever 'til it's too tough 

499.53 500.48 A: so 

501.66 509.79 A: yeah so you know in a way i like to go out for seafood because then i have a more confidence i'm really going to enjoy it and it's going to be prepared correctly 

509.17 510.36 B: mhm 

509.64 517.51 A: i mean i've asked the butcher block guy the seafood guy like okay now what do i do with this and what i mean if i was to buy it you know what do i do with this 

514.34 515.71 B: right 

517.51 518.38 B: uh-huh 

517.80 523.83 A: how would i prepare this and they've been fairly helpful and there've been a few things that i've bought that i think 

523.82 524.74 B: (( uh-huh )) 

524.15 529.40 A: there's certain things i like to go out for rather than make like greek food or um seafood 

529.46 530.42 B: really 

530.19 531.05 A: (( yeah )) 

531.31 532.29 A: have you ever 

531.37 533.14 B: i've never made greek food 

532.68 536.05 A: have you ever tried to prepare any japanese food at home mhm uh-huh 

535.72 546.13 B: um well my mom and i did try before and it was pretty fun to try to make it together but it just takes a long time and you need to be really careful especially if you want the raw fish with it 

546.07 553.57 B: like you have to be so careful how you prepare it otherwise you are going to end with salmonella poisoning and that is not fun [laughter] so 

553.61 562.18 B: um like so generally if i do want japanese food and sushi and stuff then i would have to go out like it takes too much time it would take hours to get it done 

560.73 562.21 A: yeah okay right okay 

562.09 572.56 B: right so i mean but the thing is with that is that like while i love sushi and i could eat it all day it costs so much money you know it's like thirty dollars for one meal just for you 

573.00 576.57 A: now is there certain kinds of fish that they use or seafood or 

577.16 584.15 B: oh just really fresh tuna and really fresh just like all kinds of fish and seafood and stuff 

583.56 587.12 A: mhm and there's like seaweed and a little rice and a little do you do all that 

585.76 586.79 B: right 

586.88 588.16 B: right right 

587.14 588.30 A: little wraps and 

588.61 599.89 B: right exactly so that's the biggest biggest um con against against eating out with japanese food is it's way too expensive for a just a normal day to day thing
