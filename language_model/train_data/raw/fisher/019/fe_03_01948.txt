332.64 333.52 A: oh 

335.66 341.30 B: to make a strong marriage before we decided to have children so we did a lot of travelling and 

340.84 341.85 A: oh 

341.41 345.35 B: did what we could do to like you know experience things 

345.09 347.70 A: so did that help or hurt or

350.31 355.42 B: i was married when i i got married when i was nineteen and so i've been married now almost 

355.64 358.15 B: eleven years coming up here in september 

358.02 359.25 A: oh okay 

358.59 362.58 B: and um we didn't of course we have a one and two year old so we waited were 

362.70 372.28 B: able to travel internationally local you know around the country and it actually was really good for us we did some missionary work and did a lot of 

366.54 367.52 A: wow 

371.34 372.58 A: oh where 

372.64 375.22 B: um down in southwest minnesota 

374.60 375.85 A: oh okay 

375.44 380.61 B: so i mean it doesn't it's not real far away but it's it was a very isolated area so 

378.33 379.47 A: (( oh yeah )) 

380.35 383.50 A: you can do that kind of work anywhere so 

382.85 388.59 B: right right and so we sorta just did a lot of different things and you know 

388.74 391.58 B: family means to me means you know 

391.84 402.94 B: taking it as it comes and adapting it to your family so much today people discard their family if things change in their life but i think you should adapt it 

402.60 407.69 A: oh i agree well you're supposed the idea is a lot of people get married because they 

407.84 415.94 A: think they're gonna get something good out of marriage and that their partner will make them happy but the idea is you have to bring something to marriage and 

415.28 416.55 B: exactly 

416.01 423.44 A: and you know if it's not going the way you want it you don't just throw it away 'cause your next one would be the same what you want to do is 

421.63 422.53 B: uh-huh 

423.61 426.06 A: build it so that you can grow closer 

425.73 427.33 B: right right 

426.18 433.34 A: and so you try and work on things together to grow closer instead of deciding well this isn't what i wanted 

432.84 437.11 B: yep i think people focus too many to much on their own needs and 

436.25 437.48 A: yeah they do 

437.19 438.24 B: yeah 

438.45 443.21 B: yeah it's i can totally that's like a pot button for me 

443.26 444.25 A: yeah 

443.27 453.57 B: a lot of my friends get a lot of my girlfriends are you know get divorced after a couple of years because it just doesn't work for them or it they're going separate ways and i'm like you know 

453.72 457.27 B: if that's the case then you need to like 

457.40 466.97 B: you know work together to accommodate each other if you're if one person feels unsatisfied then work together to find a way to make it better 

467.03 469.84 B: instead of saying oh this just isn't gonna work you know 

469.63 475.16 A: yeah it's not magically going to work it doesn't matter who they're with they 

472.31 473.10 B: no 

475.51 477.87 A: they'd have to work at it 

477.29 478.18 B: right 

477.98 486.05 A: to go the same way and if they're going separate ways they've got to work on just try something so that they can go the same way 

485.75 487.29 B: right right 

486.18 487.06 A: (( you know )) 

487.35 492.43 A: i agree with that there's that's one of the big problems in the world and 

491.45 492.26 B: yep 

492.95 493.91 A: but 

493.24 495.03 B: definitely definitely
