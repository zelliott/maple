0.45 2.68 A: hi this is dorie gunn 

2.67 5.94 B: hi my name's florine dillingham how are you dorie 

5.61 7.00 A: oh i'm fine 

7.11 14.13 B: good ah what do you think about especially like the enron corporation that seems to have started all this 

14.31 19.82 A: oh i don't think it really started it i think it was going on before i just think that brought it to the public eye 

19.66 24.15 B: well you're probably right that was the first pub- publicity it had 

23.56 24.85 A: yes 

24.62 29.10 B: and i believe this sort of stuff has gone on in corporations for years 

29.15 38.06 A: i'm sure it has having been in both sides or corporation in in in the offices and in the plants and things 

38.37 42.24 A: i have seen things that scared me [mn] really 

42.01 43.13 B: really 

42.94 47.74 A: and you can't you know say anything because it's your job 

47.93 49.37 A: but ah 

48.69 51.05 B: you couldn't be like a whistle blower 

50.62 57.03 A: ah well i could of except that it would of involved a whole bunch of other people that were depending on me so 

56.86 58.26 B: (( right i )) 

58.60 64.54 A: um but i think enron probably brought it to a head and i think that 

65.43 73.82 A: well i can't imagine anybody getting away with this kind of stuff but apparently they did until it was discovered 

71.67 76.89 B: understand that's what amazes me too i think there should be some kind of [mn] 

76.95 86.02 B: something that they should have to own up to this something i think it's criminal actually because they stole the money from their people 

86.26 91.49 A: that is the part that really is disgusting and sickening 

91.99 95.87 A: um there should be some more government control 

96.15 98.09 A: of that sort of thing anyway 

98.26 106.79 A: or else there should be some tightening down in the company itself about some of these people that they're hiring 

107.22 113.49 B: i agree especially those higher ups who seem to have everything in secrecy and held in secrecy 

114.44 121.86 A: well it doesn't seem like they're very careful about the people that they hire on the lower echelons i've noticed they 

122.19 130.42 A: inspect them carefully and and but i guess if you got a degree and you've got enough experience you can go anywhere 

132.18 133.27 A: but 

133.34 147.91 B: it would seem that way and to me it seems like they they have no feelings and no care no thoughtfulness for the people that are lower down they are just like pawns they don't even exist as people to these people because they're only involved in their own 

148.27 150.00 B: financial welfare 

149.61 151.43 A: (( [noise] that's true it's )) 

152.30 153.37 A: very true 

152.36 159.14 B: and the same thing is happening well it's a bit off the subject too in the airlines which is also a corporation i expect 

159.74 160.78 B: (( and ah )) 

159.76 160.80 A: (( yep )) 

160.98 163.83 B: they too were tried to take away from 

163.95 168.49 B: the lower down people and but that one got caught [laughter] 

168.16 175.64 A: yep well i think too that it's going to be they're going to be looking at them a lot more closely now 

175.72 178.04 B: well i believe so too i don't think 

176.34 179.01 A: but it's a little late for that [laughter] 

178.28 181.13 B: the government can't really police them 

180.84 182.06 A: no there's 

181.41 186.79 B: but there should be someone that they need to answer to someone the auditors the 

186.85 190.72 B: you know someone needs to answer everybody needs to answer to someone 

191.86 196.61 A: well if they're all in it together it doesn't [laughter] matter who they answer to apparently 

196.64 200.25 B: that's right but ultimately there should be some power that 

199.58 200.92 A: there should 

200.40 209.07 B: you know that everyone needs to report to not necessarily all the details but the basics so that people would know they're on the up and up 

209.55 210.82 A: yeah that's true 

209.68 215.01 B: and i think we need to go back about forty or fifty years to get where we were then [laughter] 

214.90 219.12 A: i think you know you're probably right forty years at least 

217.36 219.52 B: you know back then people could 

219.89 225.15 B: sign a deal with just a handshake and a man's word was his bond 

224.62 225.58 A: true 

225.49 229.37 B: and anymore it seems like that is going the way of the dinosaur 

230.14 231.36 A: (( yep )) 

231.70 233.22 B: and that is a shame 

233.62 236.22 B: you worked on both sides in corporations 

235.98 237.86 A: oh yes i was a buyer 

237.76 239.19 B: (( oh i see )) 

238.20 239.52 A: metal buyer 

239.76 242.33 B: and so you saw all the ugliness [laughter] 

241.71 245.03 A: yes i did well i worked for a company that 

245.38 250.06 A: ah essentially sold us out i mean they transferred all their 

250.55 254.44 A: all their ah manufacturing down south 

255.09 256.45 A: and um 

257.87 261.81 A: i mean i was almost the last person out i helped them 

261.93 262.78 A: um 

262.53 263.17 B: (( mhm )) 

263.72 269.19 A: liquidate their assets i helped them sell their properties and things and 

269.56 271.82 A: the guy behind me locked the door 

271.94 273.26 A: (( [laughter] )) 

272.48 275.71 B: but you did all this to keep your job i mean what can you do 

275.80 290.52 A: and i i told them they asked me if i wanted to transfer down there and i said no [laughter] because i don't want to leave my home and i don't know i said what you've done to us here you could do down there 

282.25 283.22 B: (( oh well )) 

288.08 289.43 B: could do it again 

290.64 293.36 B: so we've lost the trust in these people 

292.98 294.09 A: that's true 

294.06 294.99 B: yeah 

294.37 297.23 A: (( i don't know about that company anymore )) 

297.53 298.51 B: no 

297.90 300.59 A: it's not a big company and 

299.56 304.90 B: i owned a small business once and a couple of the people we made products for 

305.13 308.50 B: ah transferred down to mexico 

308.43 320.26 B: and so we no longer got the business and i think a lot of our corporations are getting products from outside the company and services especially and that's not good for the economy here 

308.44 309.19 A: (( uh-huh )) 

320.31 322.58 A: well that's true i think 

322.61 326.37 A: that has a great deal to do with the situation we're in now 

326.89 328.34 B: yes it does 

328.96 337.35 B: and ah do you think this is what these people did not necessarily enron but all those like them do you consider illegal or only immoral 

333.82 334.66 A: (( [noise] )) 

337.43 338.74 B: or unethical 

338.98 340.73 A: well it's all three 

340.68 343.24 B: [laughter] i agree i'd agree totally 

342.57 346.67 A: i mean it's got to be illegal or they wouldn't have shut them down 

347.18 349.88 B: and isn't there only like one in jail 

347.59 348.89 A: when they found out 

350.65 351.59 A: true 

351.50 357.23 B: i believe and there's like two hundred or something you know that have been 

357.45 359.24 B: exposed 

358.89 359.76 A: yeah 

360.69 365.96 B: and that if you or i if you or i did that to someone where would we be 

361.64 364.11 A: you wonder yeah 

365.85 368.87 A: [laughter] in jail for quite a while 

366.96 368.31 B: yes we would 

368.46 370.07 B: within the week [laughter] 

369.85 371.40 A: yeah 

371.06 376.37 B: and why do these why are these people not held to liability for this 

376.86 379.91 A: that's what i cannot understand 

379.18 386.29 B: me too it's like oh well we did it and we took all their money and these people have nothing left but oh well we do mhm 

386.06 392.25 A: yeah that's it well i read now i can't remember where it was that some company 

392.48 393.79 A: they're ah ah 

396.31 399.33 A: they voted not to 

400.58 401.58 A: not to 

401.60 413.13 A: some of the some of the lower down people voted not to accept a raise they said look you know the company's having trouble we don't need a raise this year and meanwhile 

414.14 417.71 A: the big guy got a couple million dollar raise 

418.09 419.22 A: and he took it 

418.13 420.35 B: and that's the way it seems to go 

419.89 421.22 A: yep 

420.41 428.25 B: it's like if you have money they'll give you a lot more to keep you why they want these people that badly i don't know maybe because they'll cover up for them 

428.28 438.31 A: that could be because you know they're they're laying off older people that have been with them longer and hiring newer ones because they can hire them for less 

437.79 444.15 B: mhm yes my husband was laid off about two and a half years ago and boy i'll tell you it hurt 

439.85 441.08 A: mine two 

443.82 444.97 A: yep 

444.68 450.77 B: because ah they got someone younger for less money and so we have no 

448.24 449.61 A: uh-huh 

450.87 455.80 B: insurance we have nothing just social security and ah they don't care [laughter] 

453.43 454.31 A: yeah 

455.77 459.06 A: well my husband had been with the company like thirty 

459.49 461.14 A: thirty years or so 

460.68 461.73 B: wow 

461.33 467.43 A: but he and well the same time the same time that my company was moving 

467.74 472.09 A: he was being dogged and they finally laid him off 

471.58 472.58 B: mhm 

472.54 476.46 A: and well he was there long enough so that he gets his pension but 

477.42 479.26 A: (( it still you know )) 

479.28 482.62 A: he could of been still working for another 

482.94 487.17 A: five years 'cause he was only like another almost ten years 

484.01 487.85 B: yeah well my husband too another five or ten years yeah 

487.20 490.14 A: yeah because he was only fifty seven 

488.23 494.91 B: and ah when you're that age and you're laid off then even the big corporations [laughter] won't pick you up 

492.17 493.15 A: it's 

494.20 496.04 A: (( impossible )) 

495.65 499.54 B: yeah it is it absolutely is and there's another 

497.85 499.04 A: i was 

499.70 501.05 B: inequity 

502.12 507.87 B: you know these corporate people some of the people in the top are not even very old 

502.15 503.29 A: (( yeah )) 

507.25 515.37 A: no and it kinda makes you mad when kids your age [laughter] are making millions doesn't it i mean kids your 

513.22 514.28 B: really 

515.68 519.67 A: people your kids' age i should of said are making millions 

516.84 517.81 B: right 

519.72 526.42 A: and the people that are working for them that have been there for forty years are making peanuts now 

525.60 528.47 B: right just minimum wage and a little more maybe 

528.81 530.80 A: yeah it's discouraging 

530.66 536.92 B: so what do you think we should do about corporations who would we hold them accountable to in the end 

535.74 537.98 A: that's a that's a good question 

537.56 539.48 B: yeah who would it be 

538.06 538.76 A: i 

539.85 545.18 B: we can't really have the government overseeing them because then it's not free anymore you know 

539.89 540.96 A: government 

544.32 545.85 A: no that's true 

545.96 551.17 A: government can't do it and if they won't there's got to be some kind of 

551.32 553.45 A: of balance somewhere but 

553.57 556.77 A: it's very difficult to decide something like that 

556.82 565.72 B: yes it is and most people you know people like you you've seen it before but many people never really see that until it's too late they don't see it coming 

565.98 567.15 A: that's right 

566.66 569.04 B: until suddenly you're out on your ear 

568.22 581.03 A: well i didn't really see it coming because they told us there'd always be this company would always be in grand rapids there's always be a detrolac in grand rapids well there isn't 

570.60 571.58 B: yeah 

576.51 577.24 B: huh 

581.82 585.34 B: well it seems like they like to lie too doesn't it [laughter] mhm 

582.66 583.75 A: [laughter] 

585.11 589.07 A: yeah they said it was really funny because 

589.48 590.38 A: (( they )) 

590.86 594.37 A: the they changed the president they 

594.67 599.89 A: they had they had a man that had been there for years that was president when i started
