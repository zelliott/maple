267.25 268.35 A: yeah 

278.09 287.48 B: it was nothing just like having your family close to you like i had friends really really good friends but there's certain things that you could tell your sisters that you just can't tell even good friends 

285.00 286.27 A: yeah 

287.34 294.97 A: yeah i wish i lived physically closer to my my family 'cause i don't really i can't i i go to school and everything 

295.01 303.92 A: so between school ah and the fact that i work all the time and the fact that i'm poor i don't really have the opportunity to go visit them 

304.51 307.34 A: very often and ah they don't 

307.96 313.37 A: they don't really like the city that much so they don't really come visit me 

314.14 320.39 A: [laughter] which i mean i wish that would change but a lot of it has to do with like my dad's panic attacks and stuff like that 

319.83 332.20 B: what you need to do no matter what you need to like put away you know save instead of like eating out you know save and just money so that you can go and visit them like surprise visits and stuff like that 'cause you don't have 

325.55 327.01 A: yeah 

330.93 332.01 A: (( yeah you know act- )) 

332.31 333.66 A: i did that 

332.56 343.73 B: like we just like we've just had holiday family means important is very important to my sister her son goes to college down here and as a surprise my brother in law sent my my nephew home for the holidays 

334.63 335.53 A: mhm 

344.23 349.03 B: and my sister almost fainted she goes that was the best gift you could of possibly have given me 

346.27 348.02 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

348.24 353.02 A: yeah that's i did my dad's fiftieth birthday was in october 

352.96 364.16 A: and ah i took a greyhound bus down to florida [laughter] and um they were having a surprise party for him and i snuck in and he about collapsed 

364.99 368.54 A: it was it was pretty fun actually [laughter] 

368.51 371.79 B: so you know what i'm saying i was in a very very bad spiral last year 

371.82 374.04 B: with my sister that i had to stay with 

374.27 375.35 A: mhm 

374.76 379.68 B: so it's important it's really important that you stay close with your immediate family 

375.84 377.23 A: oh yeah 

377.64 382.91 A: well yeah you're right i mean if if something happened to me in my house right now i wouldn't 

380.92 390.07 B: i mean if i need anything if i need anything financially i mean you know you could ask a friend but it's much better to have a family to go to ask them for help you know i 

388.68 392.14 A: right yeah i wouldn't i wouldn't ah really have anybody to go to 

390.44 401.02 B: mean you're talking about thousands of dollars you're not talking about i'll lend you a hundred you know something like that and that's why it's important that you stick together you instill values when you do have children that family is important you know what i'm saying 

400.43 401.17 A: (( mm )) 

400.89 410.27 B: you always get together on holidays you just get together and my as my mother said it doesn't have to be mother's day for me to for you to wish me a happy mother's day every day should be mother's day 

409.97 412.94 A: yeah yeah you're right 

410.59 414.68 B: and she was right when she said when she said those kind of words because you know 

414.88 417.39 B: a mother is a mother you know and that's it 

417.08 420.32 A: yeah see you're really close to your mom when you were growing up 

419.05 421.30 B: well no she passed away five years ago 

420.91 423.56 A: i mean when you were growing up you were very close 

422.48 433.46 B: yes very close yeah we had an extended family with my grandparents my aunt and uncle lived in the same house we had three floors to our house yeah we had this huge house

433.41 441.43 B: and all of us yeah mhm my grandparents had their own apartment my aunt and uncle had their own apartment and then we had the whole um upstairs and downstairs 

441.66 451.56 B: so i grew up with an extended family my aunt lived three blocks away from us and this is something that my children will never see because the closeness you know everybody moves to california this one lives here this one lives there 

450.78 452.39 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

451.36 463.88 B: and they just will never experience something like this that we had growing up you know your family of like you know like you know thirty people getting together and you know they you know we get together as a family you know but like not 

455.94 457.11 A: yeah

479.98 482.79 B: it's your family that you would call you know 

482.57 491.11 A: yeah that's another thing i think that's like that just shows why the world is like it is now 'cause so many people don't think that 

490.91 496.45 B: that's right they just lack the whole family values and friends are important and to party 

491.29 492.89 A: (( and i mean you know ))
