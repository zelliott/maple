2.64 4.11 B: after the tone 

4.12 8.27 B: corporate conduct in the u._s._a. and scandals and whether it hurts economy 

9.34 10.23 B: hello 

9.79 11.15 A: hello 

11.07 13.11 B: oh hi my name's lori 

12.55 13.98 A: my name's mary 

13.91 20.16 B: oh okay well i guess we're supposed to be talking about the i didn't hear part of it the corporate conduct or something 

19.75 24.00 A: i could hardly tell what she was saying either [laughter] corporate 

21.92 27.22 B: about the scandals well i heard about the part about scandals in the u._s._a. whether it hurts our economy 

26.84 33.81 A: yeah that's not exactly my favorite topic [laughter] do you know anything about it 

30.81 32.31 B: oh okay [laughter] 

33.74 40.92 B: well i guess they're maybe talking about like enron and you know like ah oh what's the other company that worldcom 

36.35 37.44 A: mhm 

40.59 41.90 A: yeah 

41.09 56.03 B: like i have a friend that works for worldcom and and e._d._s. too like two of my friends that work for worldcom like just their day to day daily jobs you know they're afraid they're not going to have one the next day so and i think that just hurts economy it hurts like their moral sort of selves 

51.76 52.92 A: uh-huh 

56.01 66.18 A: yeah yeah i think it's terrible i mean it it does hurt the economy and the stock market and but as far as what you do to change it i have no idea you know 

66.85 68.11 A: more laws 

66.93 70.70 B: (( yeah and and )) 

68.56 72.14 A: passing more laws or you know i don't know 

72.99 86.01 B: i i think it does hurt like the economy just as a whole because you know it's like right now we're at the lowest unemployment rate and people are going to be looking at america saying well looking at what they're doing now the lowest unemployment rate but you know still i think you know 

83.96 85.21 A: mhm 

86.73 88.92 B: i guess i'm trying to find the words it's like 

89.29 93.94 B: we'll we'll bounce back you know what we're saying 'cause like we've been through this stuff before 

91.61 92.78 A: mhm 

93.70 95.16 A: sure yeah 

94.17 101.76 B: the depression and you know stuff like that so we'll bounce back so does it like hurt the economy it's like yeah i think it does but just temporarily 

101.49 113.98 A: i think it does too but ah i don't know you know as far as changing it i suppose they need to pass more laws and and make people more accountable really it's mostly accounting fraud 

113.95 119.58 B: there you go there's the key word accountability i mean like i remember i saw like an enron um 

116.28 117.43 A: mhm 

119.67 126.51 B: like the when they were filming some of the talks about that and one lady said you know well i sent memos to this a long time ago 

126.04 127.20 A: uh-huh 

126.89 133.76 B: and you know i've indicated this before and like they called him a whistle blower i kinda called him a hero because other people in the 

133.61 145.10 B: company knew about that but they didn't step up and say something so yeah that kinda hurts the economy and the just enron as a whole it's like you can't tell me that only one person that lady who whistle blewed knew about it 

135.43 136.36 A: yeah 

144.39 146.42 A: mhm mhm 

145.87 149.53 B: so it kinda looks like maybe we're not doing honest business or something 

149.67 152.50 A: yeah that's really true that's very true 

153.02 166.94 B: 'cause i i remember ah i saw and they actually had this on jay leno that they were talking about the enron and one guy in the background was sitting there like rolling his eyes every time the chief executive was like saying something and he was like rolling his eyes like oh come on give me a break like you didn't know what was going on 

166.56 167.77 A: uh-huh 

167.29 170.60 B: and then it's funny then that guy was the one that got indicted too 

170.47 172.14 A: [laughter] 

171.72 175.21 B: [laughter] so i'm like that kinda makes it look even worse you know just the 

175.53 176.54 B: just the different 

175.64 176.62 A: yeah 

177.18 185.21 A: yeah and then they were giving themselves bonuses and you know taking all the money and and running basically it's stupid 

177.49 178.46 B: (( stuff )) 

184.19 193.40 B: yeah what was the deal with the american airlines i think they guy stepped down because is that because of the economy like he was embarrassed that he didn't admit to the bonuses or something 

191.15 192.43 A: (( i don't know )) 

193.11 200.69 A: i they're asking you know regular people to take cutbacks like stewardesses and all that so yeah then they were giving themselves bonuses 

200.80 203.62 A: that's stupid i mean it doesn't make any sense 

204.27 220.70 B: i wonder if that's why he resigned then 'cause that would be like a perfect example of like you know how how it makes us look bad like this guy's on t._v. i'm trying to help everybody and i'm trying you know to help american airlines get back together and you know it's good for the company it's called american airlines that's one thing right there america 

209.96 211.03 A: (( mhm )) 

220.41 221.92 A: mhm 

221.20 223.64 B: but then it's like if he stepped down for that 

224.14 233.41 A: they should probably just have outside accounting agencies you know handling major things and and reviewing people's books to see what's going on 

233.60 240.91 B: i i think they did with enron and who was that or something and then that that company didn't get good reputation either 

240.70 245.69 A: no they they're horrible i mean a lot of people lost money on that 

246.32 246.76 B: (( and )) 

246.77 255.54 B: i know they said like all the people this was bad for the economy it's like yeah it's bad for the enron when they're saying a lot of people lost um their life savings their nest egg 

254.65 256.41 A: mhm mhm 

255.55 267.77 B: so yeah that's definitely bad for the economy i mean it's like these people trusted the company and the trusted the economy's gonna do good i don't think it's really part of the you know the government's fault the government didn't tell the people hey lie about your accounting practices 

267.07 268.19 A: mhm 

267.94 278.78 B: you know they might have had some kind of role in it like maybe they wanted more taxes and stuff but and then they were just talking about george bush like if he asked for another tax cut to help the economy that really might just hurt the economy 

278.42 280.30 A: yeah i think it will 

279.08 280.14 B: i didn't 

280.19 283.98 B: did you read up on that or someone saying like george bush is saying that 

284.02 290.67 B: you know 'cause he wants the taxpayers to think okay i'm getting help from the government 'cause they're cutting this tax or that tax and then it's it's 

288.46 289.28 A: sure 

290.54 295.89 A: he's just trying to you know win the next election by making himself look good 

295.87 297.32 B: yeah 

295.91 300.81 A: behind the tax cut it'll do a little stimulation of the economy and then he'll look okay 

300.85 306.88 A: otherwise people are just going to say god you know i don't even have a job whatever i don't want to vote for him 

307.72 310.74 A: so that's mostly politically motivated i think 

311.27 322.00 B: yeah it i don't know like if he's personally saying like he's doing anything to help enron or it's like if he is do you know about it is it like out yeah that's 

319.45 320.78 A: i have no 

320.94 322.23 A: no idea 

322.03 330.40 B: if he is helping it's like what is he helping or it's just like do we just not read enough news about it or is he just not you know doing enough marketing to show what he's helping with 

330.18 345.06 A: i don't know i watch a lot of news but i never see anything about that you know it's just covering it up they're just kind of forgetting about it so i don't really know what he's proposing there must be something though you can't let it go on like this you know with people 

345.13 352.97 A: it's just one company after another coming forward and saying oh yeah we really weren't making [laughter] money we were losing money and you know that doesn't work 

352.69 362.54 B: and and it's amazing how some of them say like they hid like millions of dollars through this and it's like that's kind of scary that that company like god millions of dollars that seems like it's hard enough on its own 

362.38 363.63 A: mhm 

362.81 373.07 B: but we hear like one company and like you know e._d._s. and then like another big one comes out and then i'm kinda waiting for like well who's the next big one coming out 

372.30 378.24 A: i know and that's a terrible way to live because [laughter] you know how can you then invest in stocks when you think that 

378.44 381.82 A: it could be your stock next coming forward and saying you know 

381.92 384.63 A: it's not worth anything because people 

383.87 385.38 B: yeah 

384.97 392.66 A: once they they say they've done fraud and all of that nobody wants to buy the stock it just sinks down and then you're left with nothing 

392.99 396.85 B: now did that k-mart close because of accounting errors or 

396.42 407.16 A: no i think they just closed because of bad management you know [laughter] people not shopping there there's target and wal-mart nobody cares about k-mart that much you know 

400.45 401.58 B: oh okay 

406.77 415.68 B: yeah 'cause i was wondering if that had like anything to do with like corporate politics and stuff like the one i think it was enron wasn't that the guy who had like three houses or something 

415.20 417.64 A: sure yeah he he did 

416.53 418.48 B: (( so that's his personal benefit )) 

418.16 421.65 A: mhm yeah i don't think k-mart's like that they seem 

421.88 425.80 A: to be just struggling you know due to basic factors like 

425.87 429.20 A: people not going there i know that's how it is by the one near us 

429.43 431.98 A: nobody shops there and even if you 

431.02 433.69 B: (( i don't even know if there's any down here anymore )) 

433.84 437.15 A: i they closed the one by us and i don't know 

437.34 447.01 A: i'm not sorry [laughter] because i went there i couldn't find what i wanted anyway you know it's like simple things they didn't have so i'd end up going somewhere else and 

446.87 449.80 B: yeah and all those people are out of a job too so 

449.63 452.54 A: yeah there's a lot of people losing jobs there 

452.56 457.29 A: that's terrible the economy i mean it's really i think it really is bad now 

452.65 453.58 B: i mean 

457.28 470.91 B: i i think how they put it in the press like worldcom's having problems and e._d._s. is having problems and so on and so forth it would be nice to continue the press coverage about how they're doing now like my friend that works for worldcom they said they're coming out of bankruptcy but i haven't seen that in the press 

471.04 472.49 A: yeah 

471.24 474.28 B: (( they just tell their employees that )) 

472.91 478.89 A: i haven't seen anything about worldcom but i did see that k-mart emerged successfully from bankruptcy 

477.98 479.84 B: oh that's good okay 

479.13 485.43 A: so the stores that are now open they should be able to keep them open i i don't know i hope they do 

485.18 491.23 B: well that's good for the economy and that's kind of like a good example i mean whether it was corporate or not just you know that 

491.33 493.95 B: they can come out of it 'cause that's a big company 

493.66 495.49 A: (( mhm it is )) 

494.64 504.82 B: so i mean and it's kind of sad for like the people who are hard are hard workers at those company 'cause it's like once they look for another job it's like oh you worked for enron oh okay you know 

502.91 508.89 A: [laughter] yeah i didn't even think about that that's not their fault you know 

506.92 515.15 B: i mean my friend yeah she got out of there just in time you know it was like i think a year before that happened but still just on her resume you 

510.24 511.61 A: mhm 

515.36 516.47 A: yeah 

515.67 524.12 B: know people might think well did you leave the company did you jump ship or you know heaven forbid like what if somebody quit when they were part of that i mean that's 

524.20 534.74 B: bad on the economy not just for enron but for the person the employees i mean if they don't have a job that's definitely bad on the unemployment rate 'cause i mean i know some friends that 

527.97 529.26 A: mhm 

531.72 532.86 A: mhm 

534.56 544.97 B: they would say they would look for a job and then they got like an email back well five hundred people applied for this job or a thousand people applied for this and i thought they were joking so i was like dang i did not know the economy was that bad 

544.89 550.65 A: yeah i've heard that lately too over a thousand people for one job you know how do you even have a chance 

550.77 553.30 B: yeah i mean how do they even read it it's just 

553.80 559.44 A: even if you're perfect i don't think [laughter] you could get that job you know it just seems it's not fair 

559.97 564.75 A: i don't know i've got friends who have lost their jobs and their having a really hard time 

564.87 568.70 B: isn't it amazing i was like a couple of years ago we didn't know that many people that 

568.72 573.44 B: that lost um the job and now it's like you can probably name like four or five or something 

572.69 582.17 A: uh-huh it used to be there were signs everywhere help wanted you know it's like oh you could have a job in a minute if you wanted one and now it's a whole different story 

573.60 574.83 B: out of your friends 

582.17 589.49 B: yeah they had that ah the job on ah the thing about the news about that how they used to have all these help wanted signs and the story was you don't see them anymore 

589.10 593.28 A: no i haven't seen one i can't remember seeing one you know it's 

593.69 595.59 A: noone has them advertised 

594.03 594.75 B: i 

595.42 599.95 B: i think it's amazing like i saw monster board dot com being advertised on t._v.
