0.61 1.76 A: hello 

1.26 2.59 B: (( hello )) 

2.92 4.64 A: um my name's jeremy 

4.33 6.47 B: hi jeremy this is sue 

6.50 13.64 A: hi sue now all right i had problems trying to hear that recording now what what are we supposed to be discussing 

13.39 17.08 B: we're supposed to be talking about corporate scandals um 

17.36 21.94 B: and how it has affected you and what the government could do 

22.93 24.95 B: i had trouble hearing it as well 

24.67 35.87 A: let's see corporate scandal well i think that first off corporate scandal is nothing but a whole bunch of rich people sitting there trying to make more money and stuff their pockets with money 

35.67 41.43 A: stopping people like me who actually need money from having a chance to actually make money 

42.09 51.13 A: all they ever want to do is sit there and make more money and they don't care about us all they they just sit there [sigh] it's hard to explain 

51.17 52.04 A: um 

54.26 59.92 A: they'll hire on so many people and then if these people don't do what they want them to do 

60.00 69.92 A: they fire them and then have the few people that do work hard actually work more overtime even though they don't get paid for overtime do you know what i'm saying 

68.56 70.60 B: right yep 

70.03 80.53 A: and then they'll sit there and they'll hire on new people and do this over and over again and they keep keeping they keep the people that actually work really hard to 

81.53 82.47 A: (( [sigh] )) 

82.50 85.19 B: to drive down costs ultimately for them 

84.93 92.89 A: yes and they never actually offer any incentive or any reasons for these people to actually be working as hard as they are 

93.30 98.56 B: right it's cheaper for them to um pay one person overtime than to pay a second one benefits 

99.14 102.31 B: has it ever directed affected you the stock market 

101.27 103.90 A: mhm directed affected me ah 

103.33 104.91 B: like in the stock market 

104.94 113.20 A: no i actually ah don't go into the stock market 'cause i'm a i i am a spendaholic and i'm afraid that if i got 

112.28 113.24 B: [laughter] 

113.16 126.19 A: started in the stock market i would probably like make one good buy or and then sell it when it i made a profit off of it and then i'd go crazy with a whole bunch of other stuff and i'd end up like really bankrupt 

125.59 126.61 B: uh-huh 

126.25 127.33 A: so 

126.63 132.96 B: it's affected us not we don't directly deal in the stock market but with 401k it has affected us 

132.74 133.84 A: (( oh )) 

133.89 134.83 B: um 

135.17 144.77 B: i don't know how much the government can really do i mean they can do anything they really want to do but i don't know what the right solution is to get the martha stewarts 

145.26 154.92 B: out of the area that they're in but that's just all that's a lot of fudge factor is what that is you know she had the inside scoop 

152.75 153.55 A: now 

155.47 160.42 A: the government probably could do something to try and change it and make it better 

160.43 169.92 A: but i think that the government is also sitting there reaping a huge profit off of the way it's going now so why would they want to change it if they're getting what they want out of the system 

170.77 171.78 B: sure 

172.53 173.45 B: (( yep )) 

173.98 175.41 B: they always do 

176.40 179.16 A: the only time they ever actually go 

179.00 193.35 A: and seem like they're really trying to change something is if things aren't going the way they want to if they're not making the millions upon millions of dollars that they think they could make from this then they will change it and until that happens they're just going to leave it the way it is 

193.14 199.66 A: they say that they're gonna change it and they say they're gonna do this and they say they're gonna do that but they never actually do anything 

196.28 196.83 B: (( i )) 

199.10 203.51 B: know and a lot of times when the government gets their hands in on it it just makes a bigger mess 

202.89 216.48 A: mhm because sometimes they actually do fix something but more times than not all they do is get the media involved and they get people all hyped up about the issue and then nothing changes 

218.73 220.07 B: right 

220.95 227.11 B: yep i think i think there are some um c._e._o.s that have retired that's getting a bad rap 

227.16 231.74 B: like the c._e._o. from um g._e. that retired 

231.68 232.77 A: yeah 

232.15 238.86 B: i saw on hannidy and colms where or the o'reilly factor or something where they were trying to give him a bad rap 

239.19 240.14 B: um 

240.50 243.15 B: but i think the guy did work hard and make them 

243.40 249.33 B: a very lot of money and should be compensated in his retirement i don't i don't see 

247.22 257.03 A: oh well of course i mean people like him that actually go out of their way and start from basically nothing and just work their way up and make the money that they make and then they get slammed 

256.98 262.47 A: once it's time for them to actually retire and they try and like just give them the shaft 

262.28 264.06 B: yep 

263.39 273.74 A: i mean there are those that work hard to get what they've got and then once they have it you know others want to just try and take it away from them the people that actually work hard and make something out of themselves 

270.09 270.94 B: (( yep )) 

273.56 279.48 A: everybody else feels like they owe them a free ride even though this whole time they've been trying to do nothing but hold them down 

279.42 280.45 B: right 

281.84 287.96 B: well he he gave up a lot of things because of all the all the other issues in the media 

288.81 289.70 B: um 

290.91 294.67 B: from you know what i saw and what i read in fortune about it but 

295.83 299.46 B: there are there are a lot of martha stewarts out there you know 

299.58 301.35 A: yeah 

302.39 308.70 A: but there's not really much that well let's see what could the government do to actually try and change it 

309.16 311.12 A: the government could probably 

309.66 311.39 B: stiffer penalties 

311.15 325.89 A: the government could probably like keep an eye on things and say like you know you can't do this and you can't do that but then if they did do that all you would have you would have a whole bunch of people that are sitting there doing it illegally and trying to you know 

325.67 332.40 A: keep it out of the government's watch and then they'd just end up pocketing the money and nobody would be the wiser 

332.62 333.61 B: right 

334.33 336.62 A: so the thing is 

336.42 348.22 A: the probably the best things that the government could do if they really wanted to would be to try and like i guess you know go under cover in these businesses send somebody in that they don't know 

348.01 353.59 A: is you know with the government and see how things are actually running inside of these big businesses 

353.89 357.71 B: yep to police the companies themselves 

358.17 362.61 B: unfortunately that would be you know more tax dollars but 

363.63 368.24 B: i don't know i know i know it definitely has affected us due to 401k you 

370.18 372.38 B: know to watch that go down every 

372.55 375.53 B: every quarter is very disheartening 

375.78 386.97 A: yeah see my wife is thinking about buying stock in her company 'cause she works for blockbuster but with the way that the stock market has been bouncing around a lot over the last year or two she's not really sure if she wants to 

386.74 387.76 B: (( uh-huh )) 

387.07 400.49 A: 'cause the little bit of money that we do have that we could actually spare to put into that we don't want to end up just losing because some companies do something really stupid and end up losing themselves a lot of money taking away the little bit of money that we 

400.49 403.52 A: use just trying to make an extra couple of dollars 

403.08 404.58 B: (( mhm )) 

403.92 406.49 A: you know 'cause we we try and you know 

406.64 411.10 A: do things right and you know we're just trying to get by and you know 

411.16 418.22 A: sitting there working really hard making barely making it by and then if we actually invested in the stock market 

418.16 433.11 A: for like right now you would think that the war would actually help the stock market and the economy but every every month the economy has been or the unemployment rate has been getting worse since the war started 

432.56 436.24 B: i couldn't see the war stimulating the economy in any way i 

435.73 437.02 A: (( well )) 

436.38 440.24 B: think it's got a lot of people rightfully scared 

440.30 443.77 A: during world war one world war two and the vietnam war 

443.90 455.55 A: the economy did go up due to the fact that you know a lot of people got shipped across you know overseas and then those that were unemployed went and got jobs henceforth creating 

455.49 467.09 A: you know less unemployment and you know just stimulating the economy because more people had more money to spend but right now you know all you've got is a whole bunch of you know 

466.99 470.66 A: college students sitting here running around protesting 

470.54 476.34 A: and then you got people sitting there just getting into big debates over it and then all of these 

476.18 486.78 A: big musicians or actors or actresses are sitting there spewing out their opinions which are like you know causing them great problems over the whole ordeal so 

486.80 491.21 A: i just really don't know what to say about the war anymore you know 

490.58 493.48 B: i've got an opinion on that but that's a whole nother call 

493.08 494.29 A: yeah yeah 

493.62 495.93 B: [laughter] 

496.20 500.57 B: i and i i do think that made a difference in um 

500.73 505.46 B: you know of course in the economy but and and ultimately that will 

506.07 508.72 B: affect the stock market and everything 

508.84 509.67 B: um 

512.17 515.97 B: i don't know if that will play any role into corporate scandal while 

516.14 521.72 B: the cat's away the mouse will play so to speak you know you know you never know what might crop up from that 

521.66 530.83 A: yeah that's true now the thing is i think that a lot of these people that are sitting here you know in the corporate scandal that are oh so rich 

530.87 538.77 A: the main thing with them is the reason they never get caught is because they've been in it so long they've got enough money to where they can pay these 

538.63 553.00 A: you know lawyers that charge like you know a half million dollars for you know one year's worth of work and these guys are so well trained they know how to get these guys off the hook without ever actually having to do anything you know 

552.18 558.09 B: yeah i think there's might be um smaller dogs doing the dirty work for them in in some cases too 

557.87 559.55 A: that's possible you know 

559.37 563.26 A: all you have to do is find somebody that you know somebody smaller 

563.04 570.50 A: than you and they'll do the dirty work and then if anything ever goes wrong the lower guy is the one that gets in trouble 

570.28 581.33 A: and then when they you know even if they did say hey look this guy was you know paying me to do all this stuff well how were they actually going to get the proof to track it back to him 

581.00 582.26 B: mhm 

582.66 583.91 A: so you know 

584.23 587.78 A: i just really don't know how they could actually 

587.87 599.89 A: go and and catch these people it would be good if they could but i i just don't think it's any way possible for the government to actually get involved in that type of a
