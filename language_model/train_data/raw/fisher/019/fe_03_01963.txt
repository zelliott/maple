5.38 6.43 A: (( hello )) 

5.90 14.84 B: yes hi there my name is roy and ah i'm representing the university of pennsylvania on our ah survey gathering ah thing today ah can you hear me all right sir 

14.39 15.33 A: yes 

15.07 28.72 B: okay well we're just we'd like to talk to you to get to get your opinion today about corporate governance and ah you know what's going on currently in the corporate world basically ah i know there's been a lot of news about it lately regarding ah 

28.74 39.95 B: corporate scandals and that sort of thing and i was wondering if you might ah for starters just ah think if it should be a self policing thing or do you think the government should be ah perhaps more involved 

40.81 42.42 A: well ah 

42.64 45.21 A: first of all my name is jay ah 

44.65 46.17 B: and where are you from jay 

46.00 48.07 A: maryland mm 

46.76 47.90 B: okay 

48.67 51.98 A: i've always believed that the less 

52.43 55.93 A: government inter- intervention the better 

55.56 57.63 B: all right 

56.51 60.79 A: but um recently there has been some bad examples 

60.96 66.88 A: but i i i think they've come about because of government intervention in trying to 

67.17 68.32 A: um 

69.23 77.27 A: you know hide things from from the government and things like that so if there was ah less 

76.49 82.06 B: in other words you feel that the government just needs to have more regulatory authority over and above the existing 

82.10 84.10 B: laws that may be in effect 

84.97 87.14 A: ah no i don't think 

86.39 93.24 B: or do you think that ah the government should be should have less authority in fact because there may be too many laws in effect oh 

92.40 95.06 A: exactly i think it should be less laws 

95.32 100.68 A: because because the more laws you make the more ways people come up to get around them 

100.00 112.98 B: well that's that's true um but there's i think you'll you'll agree with me that most corporations out there are pretty honest but ah you know ah unfortunately the ah 

113.28 120.36 B: the results of the fewers have ruined it for the many and i think this is even reflected on the stock market itself 

120.65 121.45 A: (( yeah )) 

121.09 131.32 B: perhaps unfairly and it probably has even shied away some people from even making additional investments in the market you know even in a money market ah 

131.18 140.80 B: in a mutual fund situation where they could come in um you know with small amounts of money i think it's just given a bad ah taste to a lot of people for um 

140.86 148.19 B: ah corporations in general but ah don't don't you agree that it's the corporations in this country that really represent the 

142.78 143.54 A: mhm 

148.47 151.94 B: ah the true economy and not the government 

153.13 161.98 A: ah yeah i would i would agree that that it would represent the economy but of course the government tries to control 

162.30 167.46 A: um exactly what what the corporations' outputs are 

166.85 168.70 B: mhm 

168.04 171.54 A: ah the the more it seems the more prosperous 

171.79 175.43 A: the corporations get the more 

175.50 177.69 A: ah regulations will come 

177.93 183.26 B: well i know a lot of people feel that way and ah it's probably the results of ah 

184.03 189.50 B: certain political parties' philosophies ah which may have jurisdiction in the matter um 

189.75 194.57 B: how do you feel about ah companies having ah off shore um 

194.71 202.09 B: ah bank accounts or ah so called loopholes that they can get away with that are tolerated under the current ah tax laws 

202.65 203.64 A: (( ah )) 

203.29 213.07 B: do you think this might be for the betterment of the companies to ah perhaps ah employ more people or do you think they're just using it for selfish reasons 

204.25 205.21 A: i 

213.32 220.23 A: well of course there are some that are going to use it for selfish reasons but 

220.32 223.50 A: then there's those that that it's um 

223.66 227.56 A: it does help to to bring more jobs because it's it's 

227.74 230.43 A: it's less money that has to go away 

230.76 232.60 A: to to the government 

232.29 239.05 B: sure sure and we sure do need more jobs in this country i know that ah officially the current um 

239.29 243.46 B: unemployment rate they say is six per cent but don't you really think it's a lot higher 

244.85 251.01 A: ah i'm not [laughter] it it's hard to tell from my little corner of the world but 

246.35 248.41 B: [laughter] 

249.85 256.39 B: well in my corner of the world i sure see a lot of people out on the streets driving cars and i assume they may be out there looking for work 

255.92 257.27 A: yeah [laughter] 

257.04 261.05 B: they can't be ah joyriding during the week during the day that's for sure 

260.48 261.75 A: [laughter] 

261.97 272.48 B: ah do you think that ah so so you're saying basically that we really don't need ah more laws we just need more ah adherence to the existing laws by the corporations 

272.12 272.90 A: yes 

273.46 274.43 B: uh-huh 

274.57 280.57 B: okay and what do you think ah we should ah that should perhaps be done to 

280.52 289.72 B: ah encourage this ah ah this so called honesty by the corporations should there be maybe financial incentives or should the government maybe ah 

289.88 291.81 B: ah just try to ah 

291.97 302.07 B: ah you know come down more on the corporations in other words should should it be a voluntary thing mostly on the part of the corporations and how do you think they could get that going 

301.84 306.18 A: ah yeah i believe it would be ah voluntary um 

306.22 308.19 A: you know because money talks 

307.79 309.06 B: that's for sure 

308.43 315.14 A: and if you put some incentives out there [mn] the corporations are going to 

312.74 313.71 B: mhm 

315.15 316.71 A: eat them up [laughter] 

315.87 319.47 B: like maybe tax incentives that they could pass on to ah 

319.49 321.49 B: the employees and um 

321.92 330.69 B: you know all around be you know just have a better all around situation for everybody because some people are of the opinion that a lot of the ah 

326.29 327.80 A: exactly 

330.62 341.13 B: ah economic problems today are results of our combined tax brackets of around forty per cent when you ah you know govern in all the ah the federal the state the um 

341.55 348.69 B: you know and the property taxes and the school taxes i don't think anybody's in as low as twenty or twenty five per cent bracket 

348.06 348.87 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

349.67 356.38 B: would you like to see the i._r._a. expanded even more in other words something to get people more to save and and ah 

356.54 360.59 B: and encourage more dependence independence on their own 

360.72 366.03 A: definitely they the i._r._a. should be expanded i mean it should it should be 

366.11 367.99 A: even other avenues 

368.07 369.93 A: i mean even um 

369.98 374.69 A: you know more choices for for i._r._a. type of ah situations 

374.25 388.28 B: uh-huh because i know they're recently expanded the contribution amounts just this year to three thousand dollars from two thousand and that's been hanging at two thousand for a little bit too long ever since the middle seventies i think 

374.71 375.76 A: um 

386.88 392.15 A: yeah yeah and and and really three thousand is is not that much 

391.42 393.10 B: it sure isn't 

392.19 393.64 A: if you're talking 

393.83 396.13 A: if you want people to save 

396.28 397.95 A: ten per cent 

397.72 398.78 B: (( mhm )) 

398.21 404.54 A: you know of their gross income to put away you know especially tax free 

400.61 401.67 B: mhm 

404.25 405.25 B: mhm 

405.01 408.11 A: you know that three thousand is not a lot 

407.17 421.43 B: that's not a whole heck of a lot if you're especially if you're getting a later start in life i know if you're in your early or mid twenties that three thousand a year can ah really multiply by the time you're in your sixties but a lot of people don't ah really ah 

411.06 412.54 A: mhm [laughter] 

421.46 427.50 B: ah start to get the need to save until they're in their forties or fifties and by then it may be too late 

426.66 427.95 A: exactly 

428.13 439.47 B: ah but ah it's a start for sure ah what else do you feel the um the government um could possibly do to encourage corporations to ah 

439.56 441.46 B: be a lot more um 

441.97 446.94 B: ah voluntarily compliant ah you know for both fairness and ah 

446.96 451.96 B: you know things in general that they could help ah their employee ah employees with 

452.24 459.81 B: or or do you think the government's doing a pretty good job right now ah of of monitoring things in other words sufficiently enough 

453.22 454.47 A: [noise] 

460.64 465.08 A: ah yeah i mean [laughter] over over monitoring
