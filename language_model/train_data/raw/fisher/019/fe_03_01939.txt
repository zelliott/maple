0.58 1.63 A: (( hello )) 

1.72 2.60 A: hi 

2.20 3.70 B: hi i'm jessie 

3.72 4.90 A: i'm diane 

4.51 5.53 B: hi 

5.30 6.24 A: how are you 

5.96 7.68 B: i'm fine thanks how are you 

7.13 9.37 A: good this is strange [laughter] 

8.61 10.25 B: (( yeah it is bizarre )) 

10.65 14.80 A: [laughter] so what are we're supposed to talk about what family means to us 

14.20 15.39 B: (( yeah )) 

15.09 16.43 A: like you go ahead 

16.63 23.86 B: um well i guess i have just been thinking um i'm jewish and passover just ended um and so 

21.37 22.28 A: (( oh )) 

24.09 37.46 B: um one of one really important thing for me in terms of family is like celebrating important holidays and special occasions with my family um and it was neat because there was a bar mitzvah in my family like two weeks before 

37.44 38.28 A: (( oh )) 

37.58 41.38 B: so i had this two intense weeks of seeing like my entire family 

41.41 45.54 B: um first first for the bar mitzvah and second for the 

42.54 44.32 A: (( great my )) 

44.74 47.64 A: son just attended one of those right 

46.59 48.70 B: (( passover right so how about you )) 

49.17 57.11 A: um i you know i was i was thinking along the same lines as you i was thinking about um um you know holidays since we just had easter 

56.63 57.47 B: mhm 

57.35 65.22 A: and i'm not jewish but i ah do celebrate um you know christmas and fr- holidays and um 

62.04 62.92 B: mhm 

65.38 76.60 A: yeah easter we had some family over and my parents and a cousin and yeah it was just a nice day to just spend together and um it just means time to me 'cause so many times we 

77.48 87.96 A: just are running around and doing so many things we don't have time to really sit down and do family things which is a shame but so and and you have 

79.60 80.89 B: yeah 

88.22 89.90 A: what the family obviously 

90.12 102.50 B: yeah well actually i have a very small immediate family and a very complicated distant branch of my family that we're very close to because um we have like the same home town 

102.51 110.69 B: so even though i mean it's like the family my large family is like my grandmother's cousin's cousin's like children and grandchildren 

102.57 103.74 A: ah 

110.67 111.71 A: wow 

111.27 115.89 B: like my grandmother and her cousin's cousin were the only family that one another had 

116.15 124.27 B: um in my home town so like the families were really close even though on the family tree it's really messy and that branch of the family is huge 

124.32 126.77 A: so are they all in the same town 

126.41 138.97 B: um no now they are sort of all over the place but it's nice 'cause it means i get to see people in different parts of the country that i wouldn't necessarily get to go visit otherwise and i thought places to stay 

136.95 144.54 A: right well you know it's funny because so many families are you know nowadays at least where i live 

144.61 150.95 A: (( so many have divorces in them and you were saying you're it's kind of messy i mean so many of 'em have you know )) 

146.85 147.96 B: yeah 

151.35 156.81 A: this um axe [laughter] and that axe and so the families are a lot different than they used to be 

156.51 159.02 B: it's true they really are 

157.99 159.09 A: yeah 

159.39 160.35 A: so 

160.12 173.64 B: another thing i was thinking about in terms of family is i think the expression is actually is like home is where they have to take you in but the same thing like family you know they're the people who no matter like what else is going on in your life or no matter 

173.63 180.83 B: how other people think of you ideally anyway you know your family at least someone in your family should you know always be there for you and 

180.76 181.64 A: right 

181.03 187.80 B: you know take you in no matter what it is you've been up to and what you should be doing like they'll support you if you're not 

187.83 189.85 B: um having a hard time 

187.94 197.55 A: you know i'm i'm going to use that very thing we we i have a a teenager and he's a young teenager but we were just having that very conversation with him but you know 

197.80 206.26 A: you always you know no matter what you do you are going to make mistakes and your family is always going to be there for you no matter what and you know it's 

204.13 205.11 B: yeah 

206.36 208.30 A: we've just had that conversation 

207.90 209.64 B: mm that's neat 

209.69 213.81 A: that's a tough one do you have um is it just you in the family 

213.20 216.04 B: it is actually i am an only child 

216.05 217.37 A: (( well so am i )) 

217.49 220.38 A: i am too i am an only child as well 

217.62 218.25 B: (( mm )) 

220.27 220.98 B: (( cool )) 

220.88 224.12 A: yeah and where where do you live what state 

223.78 228.92 B: um well i'm actually i'm originally from canada um but i go to college in pennsylvania 

228.75 230.57 A: ah okay 

229.90 231.27 B: yeah 

230.71 232.93 A: well i am way way from you i'm in texas 

232.46 233.66 B: (( oh wow )) 

233.49 239.15 A: yeah so i know considering this study is being done out of what the university of pennsylvania i think 

239.16 245.01 B: yeah it is um and i i guess i think i heard about it 'cause i'm actually i'm a linguistics student um 

240.44 241.36 A: yeah 

245.03 248.11 B: and i heard about it from my department who i guess 

248.75 255.21 A: well that's interesting to hear from your perspective as a student whereas you know i'm in my early forties so you know my 

254.33 255.26 B: yeah 

255.40 263.90 A: my view of family it sounds like we're exactly the same yet we're but yeah we're looking at it from totally different perspectives that is 

257.77 259.32 B: yeah that's funny 

262.83 266.69 B: yeah and totally different backgrounds that's neat though i think that's 

266.36 267.08 A: neat 

266.94 269.37 B: that's a good thing for the world 

268.49 278.11 A: that is a good thing that is a good thing so it would be interesting to hear if they added on someone that was you know like my mom's age and see what they said 

277.55 278.76 B: yeah 

278.36 280.20 A: (( [laughter] )) 

278.97 280.60 B: (( yeah it would )) 

280.68 287.74 A: and even further talk to my eight year old and see what he says [laughter] i'm not sure what he would say about the family but 

287.93 289.72 B: so do you have a big family 

290.49 304.43 A: um i have two um two boys but my husband has um four in the family so there is three boys and one girl and family means a whole lot 

304.47 308.53 A: different to him than it did to me because my family was so small 

308.11 309.12 B: right 

308.48 320.98 A: you know we had i mean my my dad had one sister and we didn't do a lot with her and my grandparents on that side the time i was little and the other side they had five kids but we were spread all over the place so 

321.05 335.23 A: um you know we one side was more family orientated than the other um and then now it's like i came from not too big of a family and then you know my husband has a huge family [laughter] so 

335.20 341.41 A: and everybody's married and everybody has kids and um you know we were talking about holidays for july fourth 

341.48 348.92 A: we have um a lot of of family come over and we swim in our pool and let all the kids hang out and that's cool 

349.12 350.67 B: yeah that is nice 

350.79 352.86 A: do you do family reunions or 

352.64 353.27 B: (( um )) 

354.04 365.54 B: well i think at this point we all sort of there's so like i have a a lot of my cousins are all sort of around like they're you know nine ten eleven and you know a couple are thirteen and fourteen and so 

365.49 375.27 B: these days all of our sort of family reunions are just getting together for like bar mitzvahs and important ce- family celebrations some of my older cousins have gotten married so there's sort of enough like 

375.10 380.68 B: important celebration going on in the family so we all just sort of get together that way anyway 

377.13 378.04 A: right 

380.62 383.46 A: well isn't that kind of like a family reunion anyway 

382.92 384.61 B: well yeah it is 

383.97 385.59 A: yeah yeah 

384.64 393.25 B: it's just that it means that no one has to sit around like planning a family reunion because you know there's always someone planning you know a wedding or big birthday coming up anyway 

392.61 398.18 A: right right well i know that that is huge because my son you know went to 

398.29 410.96 A: a i don't know if i am pronouncing it properly but is it a bat mitzvah for the girl it's either that okay okay 'cause he just went to one and there were one a hundred and fifty kids invited 

402.59 404.57 B: (( yeah for a girl it's a bat mitzvah )) 

409.33 411.77 B: wow that's a big one 

411.34 412.98 A: those were the girl's friends 

412.73 413.96 B: yeah 

414.03 420.67 A: so yeah it was a huge one and then there was another girl that had one and that was much smaller so 

420.78 426.53 A: um but anyway it was neat because it was like she she called it her extended family 

426.20 427.15 B: mhm 

426.93 433.58 A: you know she had a lot of relatives that came in um and you know it was a huge family celebration however 

433.65 438.89 A: um you know she called the rest of 'em you know her family too so that was that was pretty neat 

436.80 437.71 B: yeah 

439.05 447.21 B: well that sounds probably a lot like my family you know that i've got you know a pretty small group of people that most people would sort of consider you know 

441.64 443.06 A: mhm 

447.32 451.17 B: family you know a a couple of cousins and a couple of aunts and uncles and then 

451.23 455.23 B: this really large extended family but it's nice you know 

453.18 454.43 A: mhm 

455.41 457.36 A: (( yeah it is )) 

456.17 461.50 B: they don't feel any less related even though there are more lines on the family tree to explain it 

458.75 459.75 A: right 

461.77 464.96 A: well you know i find i don't know about you that you know 

465.33 477.61 A: not just the traditional family but i have got a lot of really close friends from high school now you haven't been out as long as i have but i have some really close friends from high school that i consider my extended family so 

472.68 473.72 B: yeah 

477.78 485.16 A: you know i mean they are welcome at any you know holiday event anything so 'cause we've been friends forever 

480.81 481.79 B: mhm 

485.96 487.90 B: (( i think that's a neat thing )) 

488.01 499.02 B: i mean at least in my family for kids too 'cause my both of my parents have a couple of really good friends that they've known for you know an unbelievably long period of time who are very much like family 

499.17 500.72 B: and you know they 

500.72 508.00 B: very much felt like extra aunts and uncles for me except they are just nice enough level like not actually being part of my family 

507.51 509.07 A: right right 

507.98 519.82 B: but you know if there were things that were driving me crazy about my family i could go to you know someone who felt like an aunt and be like oh that aunt drives me crazy and she wouldn't mind because it wasn't actually her sister you know 

512.87 514.06 A: right 

515.79 517.29 A: right 

519.24 521.08 A: right right 

520.42 521.44 B: so 

521.15 523.70 A: are your how old are your parents do you mind me asking 

523.23 525.98 B: um no my parents are 

526.26 528.35 B: fifty nine and fifty eight 

527.79 534.29 A: oh okay okay i was i was wondering you know if they had you when they were younger and they were more my age so [laughter] 

533.37 536.06 B: yeah they were older when they had me 

534.85 537.84 A: okay so they were older when they had you okay 

537.84 549.22 A: well that's a interesting dynamic too about you know if i look around where i live i mean phew we've got [laughter] we have i mean we're we live in a pretty affluent 

549.13 552.89 A: area that has every walk of life 

552.39 553.33 B: mhm 

552.95 559.19 A: every family dynamic you know everything from divorced multiple times to you know 

559.24 564.50 A: ah somebody in their thirties and somebody in their fifties and having a having a child [laughter] 

560.82 562.17 B: (( [cough] )) 

564.52 565.52 B: mhm 

565.29 571.14 A: we we're pretty plain we've been married for we got married right out of college so we've been married for 

571.17 572.18 A: um 

572.39 575.81 A: eighteen years nineteen yeah and so 

573.12 574.36 B: wow 

575.17 577.41 B: that's something these days 

576.78 582.74 A: it is it is yeah we've only been married once and we have we waited a while though to have kids i think that 

582.86 588.72 A: makes a difference it makes your family a little bit stronger 'cause when you do it right when you get married 

583.44 584.43 B: (( yes )) 

588.77 590.21 A: (( ah it's tough )) 

590.32 595.54 B: wow i mean because you're still figuring out how to be married and then you have to figure out how to have kids and if you 

593.22 594.19 A: right 

596.05 599.07 B: you know take the time beforehand i that's right 

598.88 599.90 A: right just so
