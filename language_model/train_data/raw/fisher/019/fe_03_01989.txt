64.18 66.40 B: is ah corporate 

64.34 65.16 A: yes 

65.38 69.84 A: corporate scandals mhm and what can the government do 

66.49 68.55 B: scandals lot of them 

70.01 72.91 B: and what do how does it affect us [laughter] 

72.07 85.43 A: well it's probably a bigg- the biggest aspect of it is that it probably has affected a lot of the ec- the economy the faith in the mar- job market and it basically isn't 

85.40 90.95 A: one of the purposes of government is to have is to have a level playing field 

90.28 91.14 B: uh-huh 

91.52 94.59 A: and last several years it seems the 

94.70 98.49 A: government has unmade the level the playing field unlevel 

98.38 99.55 B: in what way ah 

100.04 103.98 A: just encour- well for example the enron affair was 

105.61 116.73 A: in seven- i think in nineteen ninety eight there was la- laws passed so that they could structure their organisation to accomp- to do what they got in trouble with 

113.51 114.41 B: mhm 

116.21 117.25 B: mhm 

117.84 118.69 B: (( okay )) 

118.74 121.62 A: um if that had never been done 

121.64 125.56 A: [mn] they would have to had 

125.75 129.66 A: been more imaginative about how to do something illegal [laughter] 

129.00 133.41 B: right right i- i actually agree with that um you think the government 

133.72 144.62 B: um could play a more hands on role with these corporations and and really like check their books a little bit better [laughter] to to prevent this kind of thing like enron and the world dot com and all that other kind of stuff 

143.76 150.86 A: well i think more i think a lot of it should i a lot of it should be that you need to have it set up so that 

152.22 156.11 A: [mn] that the rules have to be set up so that 

156.53 166.01 A: it makes a level playing field and that it makes it just it that is it would be more difficult to try except f- f- for pure fraud which is 

166.02 168.85 A: you can in a sense catch a little bit be- easier that way 

168.87 173.21 A: just to go through and do it and set it up for example on the enron piece 

173.28 175.82 A: it was set up so that you had a 

176.06 177.64 A: fake company 

177.18 178.30 B: mhm 

177.71 183.56 A: that would take all the losses so you only so basically you know if i was going to sell 

179.16 180.14 B: (( mhm mhm mm )) 

183.60 188.46 A: oil futures if i was in this state well let's say 

184.15 184.98 B: mhm 

188.48 192.20 A: well let's say natural gas is a dollar a cubic foot 

191.53 192.37 B: mhm 

192.46 199.53 A: well if i buy it f- if i buy it on the market for a dollar and sell it to you for ten dollars 

200.34 204.92 A: and of course i've ma- made a nine dollar profit you actually have made a nine dollar loss 

202.46 203.35 B: (( mhm [mn] )) 

205.17 206.03 B: right 

205.98 209.41 A: okay if i sell it to you for [mn] but the market price is only a dollar 

209.01 209.78 B: right 

209.52 211.94 A: [sigh] and but if i own you 

212.48 215.08 A: on a consolidated statement it should be a wash 

214.77 215.74 B: mhm 

215.10 218.69 A: but the laws were changed to accommodate 

218.87 219.94 A: um 

219.98 224.86 A: to accommodate it so they only had to play just one side of the equation 

224.59 226.29 B: (( ah okay )) 

227.34 228.01 B: (( i )) 

228.44 229.64 B: didn't know that 

229.01 232.54 A: and make it more to make it more interesting um 

232.97 244.87 A: there were one of the board members at the time was the wife of the senator who [mn] proposed proposed the la- the laws 

244.50 245.53 B: mhm 

244.89 246.11 A: the change 

246.30 247.22 B: wow 

248.07 250.31 B: really [laughter] ah 

248.29 251.51 A: from t- yeah and he's from texas too 

251.14 255.43 B: when did uh-oh [laughter] when did they ah um 

252.32 253.76 A: [laughter] 

256.03 257.83 B: change these laws i mean 

257.42 259.02 A: um that was back in the um 

259.11 260.27 A: ah probably 

260.28 265.05 A: in the late the late nineties mid to late nineties 

262.09 263.11 B: mhm 

264.68 265.62 B: wow 

265.69 276.91 B: so i think well what you said earlier about um how these all these scandals do affect us i mean obviously the markets and confidence our consumer confidence is down because you really don't know where to you know 

277.40 280.81 B: - you know who do you trust and who do you trust your money with 

278.98 279.94 A: yes 

280.75 290.53 A: [sigh] that's right and and some of the stuff too like um okay the auditors that catched up with enron and and part of reason they catched with it they could catch it is 'cause 

290.67 295.58 A: if it was set up so that you can declare it off off bu- off budget 

294.65 295.73 B: mhm 

295.73 310.14 A: um they don't um they if they're only looking at one side of the of the equa- if they don't have the audit for the other part um yeah i could see where they would not necessarily have have have investigated that piece unless they suspected fraud if 

307.64 308.77 B: right 

310.27 313.25 A: you don't suspect fraud you may not [mn] look at it 

312.39 316.72 B: absolutely well what is there what is there i haven't i haven't heard too much about 

316.84 322.15 B: the disposition of um those those corporate executives from enron do you do you know what happened to them 

321.89 325.30 A: um they haven't been charged yet mm 

323.43 326.36 B: they haven't been charged there's not not one of them 

326.79 327.50 A: (( mm mm )) 

327.57 336.06 A: um they had they had a coup- they had a couple well the biggest ones they had some um mid level ones had pleaded guilty 

327.93 329.20 B: they had a hearing 

335.06 336.03 B: mhm 

336.43 341.83 A: um but as far as i know the c._f._o. and the c._e._o. especially the c._e._o. have not been charged 

341.49 342.47 B: really 

342.17 346.17 A: the c._e._o. is is both of them are claiming they do didn't know what was going on 

346.16 352.19 B: and the people that all those employees that they have and all their pensions and stuff has that has the government done anything to step in and 

352.24 353.70 B: help these people or 

353.59 364.07 A: well part of it like um there is a pension guarantee corp- corporation which does ah guarantee a certain pension level a 

362.79 363.66 B: mhm 

364.33 374.24 A: not necessarily what you thought you were going to get because right for um a lot of employees it would be a- adequate but what it does it has a cap 

366.78 367.79 B: right 

373.76 374.74 B: mhm 

374.92 378.90 A: so you know so people weren't getting rich of course that now is 

379.00 388.79 A: it's been that's one that has been in existence since the mid like seventy four it has not had it has never had a deficit in its history until this past year 

383.66 384.58 B: right 

387.98 388.89 B: wow 

389.30 390.50 B: (( wow [laughter] )) 

390.80 393.57 B: that's amazing um i remember back in uh 

394.12 405.20 B: just be- just before i guess um you said they passed a law towards the late nineties but was it nineteen ninety six ninety seven when you had to get into the market at that point 

405.06 406.06 A: yes 

405.42 410.45 B: the um the stuff the trading that was going on the insider trading when all these 

410.46 412.56 B: these huge corporations 

411.25 417.30 A: well there was a there was a yes there was a lot of gr- greed aspect going on and it was just 

414.19 417.90 B: it was so manipulated oh big time yeah yeah 

417.36 427.34 A: yeah people thought they could [mn] people thought they could get away with it and the way it was being structured and then pros- then the prosecutors were not being pushed to to 

427.40 429.51 A: to get people like that you 

428.61 429.58 B: mhm 

429.87 438.79 A: know for determent you have to have people who want who want to try to be honest and have things set up so that [noise] okay just just a second 

438.80 439.44 B: (( [laughter] )) 

448.92 451.36 A: okay i'm sorry about that okay 

449.78 450.98 B: no no problem 

451.77 453.80 A: um what were we just saying 

453.16 455.81 B: um you were talking about ah 

455.86 465.59 B: we were talking about the nineteen ninety seven ninety six when the market started to take that turn and how the corruption was starting then i mean with with the manipulation of the market and 

466.27 479.02 A: well yes but one of the aspects too is has it really [mn] has it really been any worse i mean in one sense has it really has been any worse than it has been before and there's different 

479.07 485.44 A: of course in that pe- in that period of time too some of the laws had some of congress had changed some of the laws to accommodate some of these 

485.00 485.95 B: mhm 

485.73 491.35 A: and of that which which was not good [sigh] um 

488.99 490.21 B: mhm 

490.36 497.80 B: well it just became so like it was a it's just that during that time so many um lay people not just corporations and and 

496.09 496.82 A: (( mm )) 

497.68 508.60 B: investments and but people individually were just getting into the market so much and it was just so from what i saw i mean myself included it was just manipulated and these larger corporations i think um 

498.61 499.35 A: (( mm )) 

509.23 516.92 B: well what i'm saying is a company like enron or world dot com or the other ones that have ah had these scandals going on um 

513.37 514.08 A: yes 

517.20 520.43 B: they had to it had to be starting back from then 

520.52 521.97 B: and where was 

522.22 530.62 B: you know you said the government was changing laws to make it easier for them to hide things rather than make it tougher to show to prove that they you know that everything was legit what they were doing 

522.72 524.29 A: the government should just do 

525.53 526.96 A: mhm 

530.22 536.32 A: it seemed like they were it seemed like those laws were changed to accommodate something certain in favor 

536.92 537.90 B: mhm 

537.12 543.88 A: companies to get more invol- to to hide to hide things and um 

541.50 542.28 B: mhm 

544.03 545.41 B: (( you think it's a coincidence )) 

544.53 549.41 A: yes like i was saying in like the world dot com that was i mean it just 

549.44 558.24 A: that just seemed to be almost like that was real that was closer to [mn] that was a legal manipulation but that was just fraud that was 

555.49 556.44 B: mhm 

558.28 559.71 A: just pure fraud 

559.27 560.15 B: right 

560.60 563.06 A: they just they were just classifying expen- 

563.27 564.07 B: [laughter] 

563.40 567.08 A: they were classifying expenses as investments 

567.17 568.21 B: right 

567.69 570.92 A: and change your books around 

569.60 570.55 B: (( mm )) 

570.86 572.15 B: but how could um 

572.30 577.44 B: i mean there's got to be some kind of a watchdog that has to oversee this so that these these things don't happen again 

577.67 581.19 B: or laws have to be changed that they have to but you know i-i mean 

581.27 583.88 A: well one of the things that's good too is that 

584.59 585.70 A: um 

586.61 589.02 A: you have to also be you know 

589.08 599.95 A: be certain that that if you do something that is that you shouldn't be doing that you will be punished and that the punishment will be something that you would not want to happen to you it shouldn't be you know like a fine that 

597.41 598.45 B: mhm
