0.13 1.36 B: hello 

0.35 1.48 A: this is 

1.85 2.77 B: hello 

2.45 4.11 A: hello this is veronica 

3.85 5.50 B: hi this is chuck 

5.46 6.66 A: (( hi chuck )) 

5.55 6.44 B: (( ah wha- )) 

8.12 9.90 A: so how has it affected you 

10.00 15.01 B: how has it affected me well it's affected 

11.70 12.81 A: yeah 

15.05 18.58 B: me in the respect that my my grandchildren 

18.79 20.62 B: will um [mn] 

20.69 25.94 B: not ever look up to these people you know like a role model or anything because 

26.45 34.35 B: most people think [lipsmack] that when you're successful in life no matter how you get there that's what the important thing is but it 

34.36 37.42 B: but the important thing really is how you get there 

37.62 51.00 B: that you don't step on a lot of toes to get there you know to to be honest and and and trustworthy and to have integrity which is something that's really lacking in this world 

50.79 57.92 A: yeah i really think that the government should have certain laws in certain ways that they have to prosecute people that 

57.80 61.43 A: don't follow rules and the companies because um 

61.30 75.64 A: the people that work hard to make these companies successful are the ones that get affected so there definitely has to be more investigations and people you know that are actually there watching over you know 

66.17 66.87 B: tha- 

75.84 83.79 A: you know the numbers constantly there has to be more of that and there has to be laws where prosecutions you know 

83.94 92.63 B: well it seemed like people nowadays feel like if it feels good you do it you know but you can't do it at somebody else's expense because 

92.72 96.31 B: without us they wouldn't even have a job to speak you know 

96.94 110.85 B: that's that's that's what how i feel about it because it takes everybody in this world to to make it you know and if it wouldn't be for the stockholders they wouldn't have a job all the ceos'd be out cutting grass or whatever they be doing 

97.03 98.29 A: (( [mn] correct )) 

110.68 124.66 A: that's that's true i mean it's affected me in the way that um my husband worked for a company that was a fortune five hundred company and now he's laid off and the stock market has just you know completely you know that's you know 

117.53 118.47 B: uh-huh 

125.27 126.47 A: but i mean 

125.44 126.20 B: wh- 

126.72 129.27 A: what what do you do now it's like now 

128.44 131.65 B: what what happened i'm sorry 

131.25 132.25 A: yeah go ahead 

132.21 146.08 B: ah what happened to me was in nineteen eighty seven i was working for eastern airlines and um they they went down tube they went file chapter eleven you know went bankrupt but [cough] the 

146.39 152.61 B: under- underhand dealings that went along with the transfer of ah the 

152.91 157.70 B: from eastern to continental with mr frank lorenzo and frank borman 

157.80 158.76 B: was 

158.72 164.72 B: really worse than insider trading because eastern airline was sold for a song you know 

164.42 165.33 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

164.64 178.76 B: and over forty nine thousand people lost their jobs including me what i actually took an early retirement and after twenty eight years of service i ended up with five hundred and thirty two dollars a month 

178.59 192.81 B: plus the fact that i had over i i missed about twenty seven days in twenty eight years believe it or not and ah i lost over twenty four hundred hours sick leave and you could imagine how much money that was you know 

193.02 195.47 B: and i i was really bitter about it but 

195.72 204.08 B: you know you can sit around and cry about things or you can get off your duff and and go do other things and that's what i do i do merchandising work and ah 

202.39 203.11 A: (( [noise] )) 

204.03 213.70 B: i enjoy it because i meet a lot of people in all you know but these people like you say up in the top echelon should be made to pay for for what they do 

213.59 223.28 B: just like all that enron situation those people should be made to live in a tent and take in the money and give it to the people that trusted them 

218.93 219.95 A: yeah 

222.79 230.28 A: yeah the people that worked hard to make them the money that you know they did have and they just you know and no consideration yeah 

229.10 237.58 B: well that's certainly and and you know and and everybody turns their their back on it but i really do think we have 

237.77 240.13 B: (( a an administration ah )) 

240.01 241.99 B: president bush ah 

241.86 256.13 B: thank god he's in there as far as i'm concerned but ah but he has integrity and that's something we haven't had for a long time and [cough] when all the shenanigans were going on is when um slick willy president was in there you know 

243.52 244.58 A: yeah 

244.78 246.00 A: i agree 

256.04 261.84 B: and ah what bothered me was it didn't bother anybody no matter what he did you know 

261.57 270.11 A: yeah now that you know the economy and and everyone is feeling an affect now is when everyone now wants to do something about it when they should have 

270.18 273.46 A: laws should have been created way before 

271.40 272.84 B: well you know 

273.40 283.76 B: you know they had too much plastic floating around you know nobody pays for anything any more they charge it all and that's another problem you've got too you know 

283.40 286.27 A: yeah everything is too lenient there has to be 

285.15 295.26 B: and and i think um mr bush unfortunately in- inherited a lot of stuff that comes down because what happens in the time of of one 

295.28 304.72 B: leader's rule ah doesn't necessarily mean that that's the fruits of his rule it it it comes back at a later time you know 

304.73 310.99 B: so i really think he got a bum deal with all that enron business but like you said i think 

309.62 323.83 A: yeah i think that i think that i think that enron ah really just really really took a big affect on everything and a lot of the corporations are having to deal with what even the good companies out there that are trying to 

311.03 311.83 B: huh 

323.82 324.86 A: um 

325.05 336.59 A: do things the right way have taken you know affect and have had to lay off just so that they can meet you know quotas so that um they can still survive in this weak economy 

336.22 340.78 B: sure but you know also ah take american airlines 

340.63 351.86 B: those people gave up their salary come to find out that these people ah that were in the top echelon in fact the the chairman of the board resigned today or yesterday 

342.66 345.22 A: yes they did mhm 

351.88 363.42 B: bec- because ah they were taking all this money and if even if they would have gone on strike and bankrupt and everything they would have gotten like what forty five thousand dollars a year just just retir- 

362.37 371.33 A: yes and at the end at the end what is really his penalty he is out of a job but um what is really his penalty he's probably already had so much money 

371.26 381.93 A: underhand that we don't know about so i mean where where do the laws come in where he gets investigated and where he gets prosecuted you know 

373.36 374.57 B: oh sure 

378.93 381.28 B: (( i i i i don't know )) 

381.33 383.64 B: (( i don't know i um )) 

383.96 398.01 B: it's it's good for government to to you know to punish all these people and all but you can't let government run your life the people have to the people have to look for better things you know instead of a quick buck you know 

395.00 397.06 A: there has to be someone there 

397.61 408.03 A: in corporations like this there has to be someone out there looking out for the people that work hard to make you know the c._e._o.s and the presidents rich and 

405.12 407.41 B: that's true and 

407.86 409.51 B: and the harder you work 

409.78 414.64 B: the harder you work ah the more you're punished with taxes you know 

413.90 415.79 A: so what what what 

415.81 419.83 A: wouldn't you say that the government should have stricter laws or 

420.64 422.23 A: stricter penalties 

420.97 432.35 B: i think you ought to you know you can have all kind of laws but if you don't enforce 'em they're no good and that's what happens they have all these laws you know in the books 

427.79 428.86 A: correct 

432.34 440.85 B: that these people should be punished and punished severely you know even jail and i don't mean a rest home i mean i mean you know 

440.66 455.27 B: working eight ten hours a day and and earning their keep for for what the citizens are paying to put them up do you follow me but even even so when you take these big executives and you put 'em in jail what happens they go like a country club 

447.23 449.27 A: (( yeah that is definitely )) 

455.08 467.75 A: yeah it's i mean what is really that's what i'm saying it's like what is really yes he resigned yes you know he's out of a job but what about the people that gave up their salaries and they're still in the same boat from where they 

467.07 477.94 B: that's right that's why i why i say they should be made to to reciprocate for whatever people put into that and let 'em you know let 'em be um 

467.91 469.27 A: you know they 

477.85 485.60 B: i don't know how you could say it let 'em work and let the money that that they earn go back to the people that put 'em to where they were in the beginning 

485.48 488.08 A: somehow give it to a pay back 

487.75 489.28 B: yes pay back 

488.21 500.76 A: all the people all the people that had their 401ks and were investing ah in enron and believed that they were going to retire at a certain time all that all that was a lie all that is you know 

497.02 498.25 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

499.85 500.83 B: (( an- )) 

500.76 505.13 A: how do you let someone who's you know fifty five start over 

504.94 506.14 B: that's right 

505.20 514.05 A: you know how do you start over and you know how do you start saving from the start when you've worked for a company for so many years to realize that 

507.09 508.16 B: (( well how )) 

514.07 516.77 A: you know they have been robbing you blind 

514.62 516.15 B: it's hard 

516.36 518.15 B: it's hard it's just like 

517.55 518.46 A: you know 

518.02 531.83 B: like when my incident you know when eastern went bankrupt i was out on the street and then i was i i wasn't getting social security yet and if i earned over a certain amount a year 

531.80 538.36 B: i was punished i had to pay one dollar back on every three i made so why should i work for the government 

535.83 536.81 A: yeah 

537.71 542.62 A: that's true that should be that could be one of the laws that they could you know come up with you know 

538.54 539.45 B: (( you know )) 

542.29 545.04 B: well they did come up with it where where 

544.22 545.27 A: oh okay 

545.07 556.00 B: you know when you are a certain age you can you can earn some but i think they ought to make it even younger because after you reach a certain age you're not going to be on this earth too much longer you know 

556.06 569.98 A: mhm yeah but i'm talking about the c._e._o.s that you know steal money from their own company workers once they find another place or somewhere to work they they should be made to pay back so much money or they should be made to 

559.95 561.14 B: oh yeah 

566.26 567.58 B: they should 

568.33 578.65 B: they should be made to sell all their possessions they should be made to sell everything and let 'em go live in an apartment like the poor people had to do that had nothing to fall back on 

570.81 572.04 A: (( that's correct )) 

572.90 573.81 A: correct 

578.36 580.49 A: that's right that's mhm 

579.20 580.29 B: (( you know )) 

580.38 582.14 B: but but ah 

582.36 593.69 B: you know the funny thing about it is if it doesn't affect you it doesn't it doesn't if it doesn't affect people it doesn't bother 'em it only seems like when it hits home you what i mean 

593.02 593.80 A: yeah 

593.59 599.89 B: like if it's an uncle or or husband or or a cousin or whatever you know a father whatever
