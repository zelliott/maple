26.15 29.26 A: how how is it you think the government is causing it 

28.81 30.51 B: well i think 

30.65 38.51 B: they're not doing anything to first of all i don't think with the tax i think the tax is is terrible 

38.55 40.66 B: i don't think we should have a tax cut 

41.60 43.09 B: i really don't i think 

43.24 44.51 B: (( there is such )) 

44.76 48.23 B: budget deficits in this country that it's just amazing 

48.26 49.20 A: yeah 

48.31 50.18 B: and how do you feel about it 

51.89 54.91 A: i mean i agree in some respects i i 

55.53 65.73 A: i think a small some form of tax cut may help stimulate the economy but ah you know but i don't think a large tax cut 

65.66 71.69 A: is actually necessary and you can't guarantee that it's going to stimulate the economy so 

72.09 72.88 B: (( yes )) 

73.02 75.72 B: i think are you in the stock market at all 

76.24 79.62 A: um i have a 401k so 

79.61 82.69 B: similar i'm in the stock market and i just 

82.92 86.14 B: and when you know i see my stocks going down 

86.24 93.39 B: but fortunately i don't need it to live on but i just i think this country is in a very bad shape financially 

93.49 96.01 A: oh yeah oh that's definitely true 

96.35 107.24 A: but but i mean you know i i understand from the perspective of we need to do something to stimulate the economy and bring that around you know and i don't know what the answer is 

104.75 105.72 B: well 

107.16 111.20 B: what i'm afraid is that when the next president comes in we're going to have 

111.15 122.52 B: such huge debtors and we're going to have taxes that's the only way that's going to get this country started again we have to tax the people and sort a lot of new projects 

122.58 126.28 B: and i just really feel that you know we talk about 

126.62 132.96 B: [sigh] this country and i really think that we are headed for a very bad depression 

134.70 137.01 A: mhm oh i wonder 

137.71 142.53 A: i wonder if if how long it's going to take before things turn around because you know 

141.49 142.27 B: (( oh )) 

143.13 148.25 B: i don't think i don't think it will be in this i don't think it will be with this um 

149.13 157.04 B: administration i think we're going to have to have a whole new administration come in because there's going to have a lot of changes made 

156.75 157.96 A: right 

157.50 159.23 B: i mean i don't think 

159.89 160.71 B: (( well )) 

161.94 164.33 B: i mean i'm just think that 

164.39 169.84 B: it can economically this country is in for a very bad bad time 

170.00 170.57 A: (( mm )) 

170.80 178.34 A: well we've been in the bad time and i i guess i'm optimistic i still i'm still hoping that we come out of it you know 

177.62 178.35 B: (( right )) 

178.55 190.48 A: with with you know maybe when the war kind of you know the the ends of that kind of get tied up and and everybody comes back home and kind of starts doing you know their normal lives again 

189.73 196.64 B: it's not going to happen i really don't think it's going to happen i think this country is we're headed for 

197.12 205.20 B: tremendous tremendous thing because we are going to have to support this iraq forget about the oil it ain't it just ain't going to be 

205.20 206.65 A: mhm 

206.10 206.91 B: i mean 

207.28 208.23 B: i think 

208.93 211.74 B: that we're really in a very bad 

211.95 213.25 B: situation 

213.32 215.16 B: when it comes to the economy 

215.34 229.76 A: oh i agree and you can see that from from what's happening to some of the large corporations who are kind of you know going under and and i think that kind of i think there's going to have to be a lot of changes you know 

228.83 230.02 B: well look 

230.17 232.63 B: look what happened to american airlines 

232.41 234.11 A: right right 

232.84 234.07 B: there there's 

234.91 237.16 B: going to be a lot of changes and we 

237.21 239.45 B: until we get somebody who is not 

241.22 246.54 B: so oriented you know have big money behind 'em you know i just 

246.82 247.69 B: you know 

249.20 254.25 B: you live in a town you see your taxes but i think our taxes will go up 

254.30 255.32 A: mhm 

256.61 261.60 A: well you know it that might not be a bad solution 

262.14 263.11 B: well 

262.39 263.59 A: you know mhm 

265.25 271.41 B: wherever you you know it depends on what part of the country you live in but you know everything is expensive 

271.44 272.36 B: and 

273.07 276.53 B: the economy everybody talks about the economy 

276.55 279.95 B: and you cut back and you don't do this and you don't do that 

281.31 282.23 B: and 

282.98 286.62 B: tax cuts believe me and big business 

287.47 289.65 B: not doing it and you know 

290.37 293.15 B: you don't know you don't know what to do next 

293.57 294.66 A: right 

296.13 300.53 A: i don't know it's one of those things like i don't know if anybody has the answer for 

300.48 314.31 A: you know because if you raise the taxes so we get the country's budget out of the deficit you know you're going to put more pressure on the individual people and then you know they're not going to have the money to necessarily spend you know 

314.61 316.56 B: but but it's 

317.38 330.33 B: and they have proven that tax cuts does not stimulate business maybe they need some government programs building highways or building buildings or doing something to get the economy going 

330.21 331.08 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

331.31 332.13 B: like 

332.25 339.45 B: maybe like a a peace corps in the united states you know to get roads to get schools done 

340.27 340.94 B: (( but )) 

341.13 342.33 B: we have to 

342.47 346.17 B: promote within this country we really have to um 

348.06 351.34 B: start thinking about what we should do with the economy 

351.45 353.32 B: whether it's big business 

353.73 358.20 B: but big business really doesn't care about the little person it's only what they can 

358.52 360.68 B: what they can make their money on 

361.19 367.03 A: right right and that i think that's that's part of the problem and one of the things that has to change is 

367.08 375.93 A: you know big businesses not taking care of their employees taking care of you know their upper level management you know and and 

375.03 378.60 B: upper upper middle management always make the millions 

378.66 382.19 B: and millions and millions and millions and the poor 

382.57 383.62 B: person 

384.13 387.01 B: only makes x. amount of dollars 

386.94 388.48 A: (( right yeah yeah )) 

387.87 392.75 B: and and the only thing that's saving us really is that we have low inflation 

396.26 402.75 A: i think maybe there needs to be some changes so that things like what happened to the enron employees doesn't happen 

403.29 415.68 A: you know because people work for a company for so many years like that and then to just completely lose everything that they had put away for their retirement that's you know that's obviously not going to stimulate the economy 

415.18 418.99 B: and and when you have people in the sixties 

419.06 421.80 B: who can't retire because their 

421.96 425.01 B: 401k has [mn] vanished 

424.29 425.41 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

425.86 427.04 B: and i mean 

428.40 433.33 B: and you pick it up and the stock market is going [mn] down every single day 

433.83 434.69 B: i mean 

435.02 436.39 B: you just 

437.20 438.01 B: (( you know )) 

438.86 448.60 B: you just and you see services you know you look at and you really don't know what to do i don't know what the answer is i really don't 

448.72 450.46 A: mhm no i don't either 

451.13 456.13 A: i figure that's why we that's why we pay those people the big bucks to run this country [laughter] oh 

456.30 457.31 B: maybe 

459.70 462.91 B: we don't pay the big bucks i mean there were some 

463.69 464.86 B: people who 

465.14 467.13 B: will buy to become 

467.64 469.75 B: to become an elected official 

470.21 474.64 B: money is in this country is very very important 

476.07 476.95 B: like 

477.99 478.76 B: well 

478.94 481.47 B: take president bush for an example 

481.60 484.86 B: he didn't he he 

485.16 488.30 B: floundered for years and years and years 

489.31 490.88 B: and then in 

490.95 497.00 B: and then when his father became vice president he sort of kind of made a lot of money 

497.11 498.60 B: he got into oil 

498.78 499.50 A: (( yeah mm )) 

499.65 506.19 B: and he made money in oil but he was floundering for years it's the right connections you have to 

505.78 507.49 A: yeah oh yeah 

507.26 513.31 B: you have to have the right connections if you don't have the right connections you're in aid of lot 

513.33 515.14 B: lot of trouble 

515.33 523.08 A: well and it's that way from the president you know on down to to your you know normal business is it's all about who you know 

523.17 524.21 B: (( well )) 

523.32 524.20 A: (( you know )) 

524.83 527.18 B: what type of business you know 

527.42 531.70 B: what might sell in one part of the country won't sell in another part of the country 

531.50 532.66 A: (( right [noise] )) 

533.01 534.07 B: i mean 

534.85 536.05 B: example 

536.23 538.02 B: (( what can i use as an example )) 

538.92 545.50 B: everybody has a digital camera and everybody has a cell phone i don't know where people get money to do that because 

545.24 546.07 A: (( sorry )) 

546.03 548.69 B: it's very expensive with a cell phone 

550.07 551.30 A: yeah 

551.87 552.86 B: i mean 

552.95 557.27 B: there are some people have three and four cars and they're 

558.28 564.05 B: mortgaged to the hills with fifty nine houses i don't know how people live i really don't 

565.70 575.19 A: i don't either 'cause i see you know i see that a lot you can see that just driving around you know it's the not so nice neighborhoods with the really nice cars sitting outside and 

575.11 576.12 B: well i 

575.35 576.78 A: makes you wonder 

577.24 590.65 B: i live in a big city and fortunately where i live the one thing that saves it me is we have mass pratan- [mn] mass transportation and plus the fact i can do i walk a lot 

590.31 591.50 A: mhm 

592.12 594.44 B: and if i didn't have that you know 

597.48 599.89 B: and i look for bargains otherwise
