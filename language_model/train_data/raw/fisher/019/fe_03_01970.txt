80.93 84.43 B: and if that that may seem harsh but if it is then it is 

84.47 91.17 A: well it's no more harsh than than sending somebody to jail for a drug crime or 

91.39 103.35 A: or any number of other shoplifting or other things people who don't have money a lot of times are sent to jail without question without any kind of ah hesitation ah 

103.53 107.72 A: of course far more quickly than someone who has 

107.95 110.93 A: quite a bit of money like a martha stewart or

142.76 143.74 B: yes 

144.43 151.91 A: it's made me much more distrusting of ah big business of corporate corporate environment 

152.16 154.51 B: and it's done that to me too i have um 

155.09 159.90 B: it cost me a little money i there was a there used to be a company called i._p._a._l._c._o. 

160.23 161.58 B: indianapolis 

160.50 161.94 A: called what 

161.86 165.11 B: i._p._a._l._c._o. indianapolis power and light company

166.92 169.19 B: for the little person ah 

169.46 177.40 B: it had a growth rate of six or seven per cent it paid seven per cent dividends and it was just ah a marvelous place for the little person to put his ah 

177.57 178.57 B: his money 

179.28 185.49 B: and then it was taken over by a big company called a._e._s. and there's actually a lawsuit going on right now against a._e._s. 

185.58 187.36 B: a._e._s. grossly 

187.57 194.52 B: misstated ah their worth and the value of 

195.35 200.99 B: of the stock that was exchanged for i._p._a._l._c._o. stock has declined ninety nine per cent now 

200.59 201.51 A: (( [noise] mm )) 

201.14 206.30 B: now somebody can be lucky and i guess i was lucky because i only had twenty five hundred dollars 

206.62 215.99 B: that's now worth two hundred and fifty but ah i was talking to my stock broker and he said he has clients that just worked for i._p._a._l._c._o. you know for their entire life 

216.09 218.52 B: and that was their ah 

218.74 226.52 B: retirement and they came in with he had one client who came in with a quarter of a mill that's now worth twenty five hundred dollars 

228.05 228.91 A: (( mm )) 

229.21 230.52 B: that would make me bitter 

230.86 238.36 A: yeah [laughter] yeah i can't agree with you more and that's the thing that i really hate about the 

231.53 239.08 B: [laughter] 

238.42 242.28 A: situation with enron and m._c._i. and some of the other 

242.52 246.42 A: scandals that are probably in progress even as we speak 

246.51 256.54 A: that many people have lost their retirement they've lost their you know a terrific terrific amount of savings i know a teacher who um 

257.25 258.83 A: was telling me that 

259.07 270.93 A: she and her husband had quite a lot of money invested in the stock stock market and they had lost a a bunch of money from m._c._i. and from some other investments that they had 

270.83 275.34 A: so i personally know several people who've been affected by this 

275.39 281.16 A: and they can't help it i mean it has to make us anybody who has any degree of wisdom 

281.32 282.96 A: ah it has to make you 

283.03 284.95 A: much more distrusting 

286.63 287.96 A: of corporations 

289.51 290.36 B: now i 

289.65 292.03 A: it makes you think go ahead 

291.49 295.54 B: go ahead i i was just going to go to the next question but go ahead finish your thought 

294.97 296.48 A: what's the next question 

296.19 303.43 B: it was the middle question has the cascade of corporate scandals caused the mild recession and decline in the u._s. stock market and economy 

305.32 310.85 B: i really don't think so it may of had a minor effect but i think there were other things that caused that 

311.94 323.79 B: but that still doesn't say i still think martha stewart and company belong in jail and the the scandals have made me more distrustful and and bitter 

326.05 329.22 A: yeah i can say ditto as well 

329.72 336.95 A: i was gonna say that i pretty much agree with you on the fact in the fact that ah 

337.45 341.95 A: the scandals i mean that the recession was not caused by 

342.02 346.81 A: corporate scandals i think there's some other factors that have affected that [mn] 

346.84 348.08 A: (( but ah )) 

348.55 349.92 A: i too say 

350.10 351.58 A: anybody who 

351.67 358.12 A: particularly these people who have a lot of money including celebrities as well who do things and feel that they can 

358.37 362.19 A: get away and in many cases do get away with it because 

362.28 376.16 A: they have a lot of money i think they need to start making some examples of people and i hear bush talking about how he's coming down hard on corporate crime and all this kind of stuff i think that's just a lot of um 

376.59 379.34 A: idle re- rhetoric [laughter] 

379.62 381.57 A: i don't think there's anything to 

379.67 384.63 B: yep i want to see it just show me 'cause i don't believe it 

386.96 399.05 A: it yeah 'cause those are the people who support him i mean who got him in office you know those some of those ah big corporate giants so i mean i don't you wouldn't expect him to come down too hard on them 

399.55 402.08 B: no 'cause that is the ah hand that fed him 

402.19 405.44 A: yeah you're not gonna bite off the hand that feeds you 

406.03 407.67 A: in most cases 

409.43 414.48 A: but i do i do believe that something's gotta happen i mean something's gotta 

414.77 420.15 A: stop something's gotta give i mean people are just getting away and particularly the rich 

420.20 423.09 A: are getting away with too much i mean they people 

423.13 424.90 A: have a fit when somebody 

425.46 438.60 A: robs a convenience store or something like that and not to say that people should be exonerated when they do stuff like that but i don't think that's any worse than in fact i don't think that's as bad as as taking [laughter] 

438.51 446.11 A: um millions of dollars from literally out of people's pockets and ruining their retirement ruining their futures you know 

447.11 448.85 B: yeah i really agree with you 

449.24 452.88 B: we're going we're undergoing something here and i'm sure it's not 

452.99 465.65 B: um foreign to any place else in the country but united airlines has a um a great big maintenance base here but used to it only used to be in san francisco but they built one in the midwest 

465.48 466.29 A: (( mhm )) 

466.03 467.52 B: and um 

467.79 470.44 B: with the um economic slowdown 

470.66 475.82 B: united has told everybody every single person 

476.08 479.49 B: that they're on leave without pay until some time in july 

479.88 488.23 B: at the same time it was announced that there were several united upper management types 

488.57 490.47 B: that were given bonuses 

490.69 497.83 B: for saving the country i mean the company and if that's not if that's not just wrong 

493.50 494.38 A: [laughter] 

498.95 503.40 B: i've got a neighbour that probably makes around forty five thousand dollars he's got a wife and two children 

503.75 506.92 B: and now he has no money and he's worked for united for 

506.99 508.17 B: twenty years 

509.36 511.34 B: and they were giving these big ah 

511.92 519.15 B: corporate managers million dollar bonuses why don't they do away with that and ah distribute it ah 

519.27 521.03 A: among the employees 

520.39 521.86 B: among the employees 

522.22 523.12 A: yeah 

523.27 524.49 A: i agree 

525.07 526.21 A: well it's 

526.42 532.80 A: i think it's it's this is pretty we seeing the same story kinda play itself out in 

532.96 539.77 A: in our world in the in the united states and in fact throughout most of the world that we've always seen and that is 

540.01 546.40 A: the people who have money the rich get richer the poor get poorer and i think there's been there's 

546.92 548.98 A: a widening gap 

549.07 553.99 A: that's occurring between the rich and the poor i mean 

554.30 564.94 A: there's no longer a a very clearly defined middle class in between the two i think the middle classes with the line between the two is becoming more and more blurred 

565.28 566.89 A: as time goes on 

568.35 576.07 A: because of of exactly what you're talking about the kind those kinds of things i mean i i think that's one of the things that contributing to it 

577.60 582.74 B: i agree with that i see i'm in the process now of trying to get my kids through college 

583.05 583.91 B: now 

584.15 585.46 B: thirty years ago 

585.89 589.79 B: i put myself through college by um 

589.85 599.58 B: working in the summer and actually ah i drove a taxi cab at night and on weekends and i could make enough money to be able to afford
