29.51 37.07 A: the taxes and everything does it benefit us or i know it is kind of a weird question basically to ask us because [laughter] 

33.57 43.58 B: well well i i see i didn't hear i didn't hear anything about the economy i heard how can government do to curb illegal activity 

43.04 47.85 A: right that was part of it and then they were talking about the economy about the economy 

48.25 51.22 A: illegal activity about the economy ah 

50.51 52.37 B: okay okay 

51.35 58.49 A: you know everything basically or the stock market how to improve it in other words and how it has affected us in any way 

55.64 56.75 B: okay

59.55 66.28 A: ah [laughter] how to curb illegal um well basically businesses you could we could say are 

66.43 68.00 A: pretty much um 

68.43 72.61 A: following but again they're doing what they're there's a lot of illegal 

72.74 79.23 A: companies out there that are not performing correctly and not showing you know their accounts during 

79.34 82.57 A: during accounting the ir- you know the taxes 

82.67 90.05 A: they're hiding a lot of you know important information they disclose and that's why ah companies like a._o._l. and things like i've heard 

90.14 97.11 A: in the stocks and therefore they're they're they're finding them that they have a lot of illegal um 

97.63 101.34 A: ah cases where they find i don't know if you've heard of that with a._o._l. 

100.96 102.25 B: no i haven't 

102.48 108.28 A: you know certain things they're not really showing their taxes in full and um how much money they're making they're 

108.35 111.62 A: making it the amounts bigger than what they are 

110.19 114.53 B: so you're you're talking about illegal tax returns from companies 

112.70 117.31 A: yeah yeah but it's that's illegal that's what i believe they mean 

116.98 121.02 B: okay and what were they talking about the stark stock market 

117.75 118.84 A: you know ah 

120.81 126.01 A: well the stocks affect us too because people that have invested their money in there 

125.62 129.13 B: are they talking about illegal activity like um 

126.04 127.55 A: are pretty much um 

128.71 129.83 A: mhm 

130.36 143.28 A: well in businesses in businesses basically you know you know and a._o._l. is a business and a company i presume they're you know they're any company basically it's this is more like a political question for government i think i don't [laughter] 

130.98 132.40 B: oh the current 

132.93 135.29 B: okay okay okay 

142.52 144.18 B: i i agree 

143.77 151.49 A: you know this would be very hard to answer you know i mean i'm trying to think of what else to talk about illegal 

149.79 150.82 B: i know 

151.03 152.95 B: i know um 

152.62 157.37 A: the stock market and businesses and things like that how can they improve and 

157.50 160.70 A: and you know stop the illegality out there 

161.36 162.78 A: it's something that 

163.01 165.01 A: it's very hard to do really 

165.52 172.11 A: unless they produce laws more stricter laws in government and by lowering taxes 

168.23 169.49 B: well that's 

170.99 173.66 B: i would say stricter monitoring 

173.11 178.06 A: monitoring yeah yeah but lowering taxes you think they're doing anything [laughter] i mean 

178.07 179.17 A: he does 

179.44 188.97 A: want to make a budget bush this year over five hundred fifty billion dollars to cut taxes you know in order i guess 'cause he sees that this will 

188.79 190.34 B: increase spending 

189.17 192.62 A: increase right spending and increase um 

193.03 199.42 A: you know therefore the stocks will go higher and you know people who have investments that is i don't have any investments 

198.83 200.21 B: i don't either 

199.92 208.35 A: so for me it's not beneficial i don't think like everyone has stocks you know what i'm saying these are benefits to the wealthy basically 

205.32 206.36 B: uh-huh 

208.33 209.30 B: well i 

208.79 209.71 A: i mean 

209.51 216.63 B: but but i think it's just um encouraging an economy even even for people like you and i 

216.39 217.40 A: mhm 

216.78 222.40 B: that um might replace a washer and dryer where we wouldn't otherwise um 

222.51 225.14 B: i just think it increases spending 

225.35 227.94 A: right i agree too i don't think it 

226.51 229.26 B: at whatever at whatever level 

228.33 234.15 A: it does at but only to the hands of i believe to the people that have you know 

234.18 235.32 A: i mean if 

235.37 238.72 A: i don't think for the people in the middle class or the poor class 

238.73 242.03 A: um does it do any make any difference to them 

242.16 246.52 A: ah the people the richer people of course will have more money in their hands um 

245.21 246.29 B: yes 

246.38 247.74 B: well that's i 

246.73 250.59 A: of course those people that never had it won't have it basically you know [laughter] 

250.89 255.62 A: i don't know i don't agree with that much tax cutting i mean 

255.68 262.48 A: um they're thinking more jobs more beneficial for say people that are not working there's a lot of people not working now 

262.55 263.50 A: i'm 

263.25 272.27 B: well i think that it it stimulates the economy to a sense but i don't know what this tax cuts means to the everyday citizen 

263.58 264.78 A: working but 

269.65 270.45 A: (( mm )) 

271.80 275.47 A: (( right right i don't think it really does anything for the everyday )) 

273.33 282.84 B: i don't know what they're talking about how much more goes in their pocket but i believe that at the time of tax returns and um 

277.01 278.05 A: (( right mhm )) 

283.26 286.56 B: even a couple of years ago when they had um 

287.55 289.68 B: you got so much back 

289.55 290.43 A: right 

290.49 291.76 B: i don't remember 

290.79 297.09 A: what do you mean from the taxes you mean when they lower the the federal tax yeah but different types of that was a different type of tax 

292.03 293.17 B: (( yeah )) 

293.93 294.73 B: (( yeah )) 

296.96 307.48 A: because their kind of tax mostly this is more caters for businesses which will improve our jobs and things you know like things in that sense but the kind of taxes you're thinking about is salary 

307.33 312.93 A: fed taxes or state taxes where they lower them which gives us more in the pocket but this won't though 

309.07 309.99 B: yes 

312.95 327.90 A: what is bush is proposing is totally different this won't put money in our pockets more i don't i mean i haven't seen my pay check difference [laughter] yet i um you know it i don't think it's gonna you know and this one that's proposing is basically for businesses basically 

328.09 334.88 A: it's really for businesses um to make it but i don't believe that by lowering these taxes businesses will 

335.33 339.02 A: hire more people i mean they're looking to save also 

339.16 346.89 A: and they're looking you know so with the stock market down and everything they're not putting their money in there their investments are low so they're losing too so 

340.36 341.49 B: (( when there are )) 

346.95 348.07 A: i don't see 

347.12 349.21 B: they're just trying to recover 

348.75 357.00 A: they're trying to recover something that's gonna be very difficult after [laughter] you know for companies think of all the money they had invested in stocks that's 

355.95 357.17 B: that's true 

357.30 361.99 A: true they're losing and hurting too this way it's a benefit to them to make them feel they have more money 

362.03 370.23 A: and but they're laying off a lot of people they're still gonna lay off a lot of people by cutting more taxes what benefit does it do i don't i don't see the benefit of it 

369.56 373.74 B: see i didn't realize that was going primarily to big business 

373.72 380.12 A: yeah because they're mostly doing the illegal you know [laughter] is that what the the question right they 

379.37 382.30 B: well no i didn't understand it that way 

381.52 383.18 A: i know the government 

383.19 385.80 A: illegality and i 

386.07 389.04 A: i don't know which way which way did you understand it 

389.15 391.34 B: i understood it to mean 

390.99 392.06 A: mhm 

391.44 392.58 B: that 

392.77 397.76 B: how do we feel that our government can can 

395.60 396.53 A: mhm 

398.69 401.41 B: i believe believe they used the word curb 

401.85 403.10 A: curb yeah 

402.29 404.91 B: illegal um 

405.62 407.89 B: operations illegal 

407.03 408.99 A: mhm with businesses 

408.02 410.15 B: practices 

409.54 410.38 A: right 

410.74 416.23 B: but i didn't understand um that they meant how it affected our economy 

415.91 416.88 A: right 

416.33 419.04 B: i i thought i understood it 

419.84 421.59 A: well what is the government let's say 

419.91 429.40 B: as an example the ah some of the stock market scams that have gone on it's what i thought that they were talking about 

421.98 423.76 A: what is the government doing yeah 

424.80 425.67 A: right 

428.30 434.43 A: that's what i thought so too because then the second part they said was about stock and how the scams and everything 

434.02 436.78 B: did you have trouble understanding that 

436.15 448.94 A: well it didn't make it wasn't a general one point question it was like too too many in all all at once with like three different questions she said and it's like you know which one should we answer that's why we're having trouble here you know [laughter] 

439.33 440.38 B: yeah 

441.75 443.23 B: exactly 

443.50 445.07 B: exactly 

448.99 451.05 A: but you know we're trying you know [laughter] 

450.83 462.18 B: well i i agree it's better laws but i just think that it's better monitoring of those laws and and i don't know if that's done at tax time 

451.57 452.51 A: it's a 

452.56 453.51 A: separate 

457.32 458.34 A: mhm 

458.56 459.38 A: true 

462.21 463.04 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

462.71 466.70 B: um i don't know if it's done through audits 

466.92 470.34 A: right it is done through audits it is done through i know 

467.41 468.76 B: (( i would )) 

468.95 478.01 B: think that it would have to be and and that tells me that it's done at tax time whether they audit mid year i don't know maybe they need to 

470.63 471.48 A: right 

474.58 475.48 A: right 

476.51 486.29 A: maybe they should make more stricter rules and more ah right like twice a year auditing to stop you know all these scams going on for the companies that is 

484.18 486.68 B: well i i also think that there's 

486.79 489.84 B: too many loopholes for business 

489.62 490.91 A: (( there is there is )) 

490.31 491.46 B: um 

491.59 493.13 A: i agree with that too 

492.61 499.74 B: even i mean i'm more aware of it in small business and in what i see and what people use as write offs and that sort of thing 

496.81 497.67 A: right 

499.52 501.01 A: right that's true 

499.96 503.19 B: but if they do it then big business does it to 

503.08 505.68 A: mhm oh they would even do it more 

505.53 518.32 A: well they get to write off anything almost anything whatever they spend whether it is for themselves a vacation for themselves the president of the company you know they write off everything so they have their benefits to it too you know mhm 

517.69 523.62 B: well outside of whistle blowers in a company how do you feel the generally um 

524.14 526.50 B: find out that this is being done 

527.01 541.23 A: outside would be the only way is i guess auditing that's it because let's say they would have to report their expenses and what they spend and they have to really investigate on each one if they do present them bills and things like that the paperwork 

540.08 544.15 B: then they would have to they would have to follow paper trails and 

541.26 553.43 A: right they would have to investigate each right and that's the only way and sometimes they can't be accurate because someone somebody's gonna say i spent it on this when necessarily it wasn't on that you know so it maybe for themself 

553.01 554.52 B: and so we're talking 

553.44 554.85 A: it does happen 

554.57 559.70 B: we're talking big time expense government expense in monitor this 

556.58 557.46 A: right 

559.31 562.73 A: yes yes probably most likely yeah 

562.88 565.54 A: i don't know if um you could 

565.63 571.79 A: you can ah you can curb it not stop it that's what they mean you can curb it mhm 

570.65 573.74 B: well i personally think that the small 

574.02 581.09 B: um small business owner is audited more than than large corporations yes i do 

579.12 582.33 A: really what they audit it twice a year or something 

582.01 585.49 B: no i just think that there's too many red flags 

585.09 598.51 A: on on smaller companies yeah compared to bigger companies well maybe they should make more like you said more stricter ah laws for them to be monitored more often it's like small businesses you know um 

586.56 587.66 B: yeah 

588.09 589.25 B: (( yeah )) 

594.33 595.34 B: uh-huh 

598.71 599.89 A: sometimes you know what it is
