0.33 2.62 A: hi my name is ed 

3.09 6.68 B: ed ah good afternoon my name is wayne 

6.70 8.03 A: hello wayne 

7.53 10.32 B: hi i'm in nashville tennessee 

9.75 14.36 A: well we're in dallas texas [laughter] 

12.37 13.23 B: (( not )) 

13.32 15.63 B: too terribly far ah 

15.72 16.92 B: but ah 

17.07 18.35 A: is this your 

17.19 21.39 B: i understand that ah that the topic is ah 

21.90 27.51 B: is if or what if anything the government can do to um 

26.47 36.71 A: and how right and how has it affect the corporate greed has it affect you and you know what has how has it affected you 

36.20 42.18 B: right right i well understand and and ah 

42.21 55.05 A: actually ah to give you an example we were in the stock market we're retired and we were in the stock market and as the stock continually kept down going down 

55.06 66.59 A: and then we heard about enron and different other companies and how they're affecting the market we decided to go with an annuity 

66.02 67.66 B: mhm yes 

66.92 68.24 A: which 

68.31 71.10 A: gives us a little more security now 

71.35 79.44 A: when we were discussing annuity we went to ah one that was based on the which is variable 

79.44 92.27 A: which is still based on the market so as the market fluctuates we do have fluctuation on this annuity but it is guaranteed to the base amount that we have 

91.02 96.60 B: yeah there is a base ah ah for it as opposed to it bottoming out on you 

96.46 98.12 A: that is correct 

96.74 101.10 B: yeah i'm i'm just very slightly 

101.58 105.61 B: slightly aware of the variable annuity option 

105.48 117.57 A: well with the variable annuity that we have which gives us protection against economic ups and downs um we are committed for a seven year period 

116.82 120.74 B: right that is the okay that is the stipulation because 

119.47 124.83 A: that is a stipulation so if you decide to leave early 

124.77 129.80 A: you're looking at like um fifteen twenty per cent i think ours is like 

129.71 141.22 A: twenty per cent so what we would normally do is yeah we've got some chances that you know if the market turns around which hopefully it would 

141.19 154.68 A: ah now that we're getting more government intervention they're looking at accounting practices more we're gonna we're not gonna be hurt as much but yeah we were a little bit concerned 

155.09 163.76 A: now my wife ah retired from a firm got her retirement package has had not problems 

164.31 169.93 A: because it wasn't based just generally on the stock of the company 

169.98 174.30 B: well yeah for which i'm sure she is ah 

175.06 177.02 B: very grateful having 

176.33 178.07 A: oh yes 

177.35 180.19 B: watched ah very carefully 

180.90 188.58 B: even though i've never been involved in corporate life like like you i am retired i'm sixty 

188.14 192.54 A: oh you're a youngster i'm sixty five [laughter] 

190.63 197.14 B: yeah i retired a couple of years ago i was on the fire department they permit you to go when you're fifty five 

193.05 194.13 A: uh-huh 

196.37 198.25 A: oh well good for you 

197.45 200.06 B: if you have enough time in 

199.81 200.89 A: uh-huh 

200.40 213.93 B: um but watched all of it very carefully myself and the you know the question too i wonder how you feel ah whether congress itself or any legislative body for that matter 

214.57 219.21 A: well i feel that congress is getting involved ah 

215.21 216.03 B: can 

219.14 223.98 B: probably due to great protest from the american public most of whom lost money 

222.02 235.48 A: oh yeah well yeah that's true and then you know to ah if they want to stay in congress they've got to listen to their constituents and basically um 

235.63 250.50 A: the i i'm almost sure your finance and security committee is ah looking into this and looking at ah well example ah more stricter ah 

251.02 255.19 A: you know looking at stricter guidelines they're also looking at 

255.17 267.23 A: ah more um open accounting practices and ah i think what they did recently with the um executives having to sign 

267.32 268.67 A: um 

268.90 271.21 A: sort of a loyalty oath 

271.38 279.82 A: to suggest that they are going to ah govern themselves accordingly ethically et cetera 

279.70 289.14 A: it's important but you're still gonna get somebody that basically ah sees the market as a personal gain and ah 

289.24 301.40 A: wants to ah see what he can get away with and i think it's gonna be a little more difficult now because congress is aware of it these executives when they're reporting 

301.53 307.11 A: their um profit and loss statements are really signing off 

306.57 314.98 B: are signing off on what what is supposed to be the truth but it's turned out to be a colossal pack of lies everybody from worldcom to 

307.68 309.41 A: yeah and 

312.30 314.03 A: well 

314.44 327.26 A: well i'll give you an example this is what this is what's happening especially in dallas with american airlines with cottie the c._e._o. i mean he 

315.81 317.08 B: (( really )) 

325.63 327.98 B: right all of us have seen that 

327.34 333.07 A: yeah he had to resign there was nothing he could do i mean 

329.40 330.44 B: resign 

330.72 331.56 B: right 

331.88 334.91 B: well ah it's that humiliation 

335.00 336.14 B: it ah 

336.40 339.03 B: if a gentleman was 

339.49 342.45 B: willing to stand up and meet 

342.72 345.82 B: after workers make incredible concessions 

346.82 353.91 B: and they pad their pockets with colossal bonuses to stand and look at these men and women 

354.57 362.17 B: then he's got more cahonies than many texans i've met and texans have big ones [laughter] 

359.71 365.52 A: [laughter] well thank you very much ah i 

363.93 367.83 B: i was stationed in texas i don't know they treated me pretty good 

367.38 370.18 A: well and i'm passing through 

370.00 375.35 A: tennessee to ah go up to kentucky 

375.17 378.22 A: we're gonna do some we've got a national 

378.02 390.30 A: camping organization they're gonna do the midwest but basically it's true that um a lot of corporations are looking for one 

390.08 399.78 A: the profit and loss statement that's how the guarantee their um shall we say their existence 

399.79 404.13 A: ah in their positions and their salaries but 

404.75 407.13 A: still i'm amazed at how 

407.03 416.11 A: these executives and i know they have a large responsibility but just how they seem to get their bonuses 

415.98 430.10 A: their salaries their stock options and the middle class working person still has to struggle so i think with congress having them ah 

430.14 431.81 A: signing off 

432.07 436.86 A: scrutinizing them now i think ah the 

436.99 451.06 A: accounting organizations are going to have to police themselves more and ah yeah it's ah it's a big hit and a big concern but i think it's turning out to be better 

451.52 457.74 A: now not the best not cured but better now that it was before 

457.66 462.51 B: what you have ah you have a great deal of ah of faith ed in um 

462.15 465.31 A: well let me say this i'm a laborer 

463.76 465.95 B: in in our congress 

466.13 471.29 B: that that i'm sorry i don't have that i'd like to have faith 

471.30 474.45 A: (( well i understand )) 

471.54 473.59 B: but i i'm a 

473.86 478.56 B: tad sceptical having observed politics [laughter] for many years 

479.09 481.28 A: i well as a matter of fact 

480.41 481.88 B: lack of courage 

481.84 485.02 A: yeah no i agree with you and especially 

483.74 488.68 B: to buck the corporations that are in fact feeding feeding the trough as they say 

485.31 488.01 A: well not only the corporations 

489.38 493.94 A: no but i think you make a good point because you being a fireman 

494.27 503.18 A: and being a civil servant or having been a civil servant and i'm i'm sure city government has put you 

503.53 515.66 A: you know to the against the wall as they're doing right now in dallas with the police and the fire department they're giving them increases not as much as they want 

515.04 521.35 B: yes but that has very little to do with corporate life itself and and how congress ah 

517.41 519.36 A: yeah well that's true 

522.49 526.44 B: i i understand all of the things that you said 

526.63 528.90 B: and yes ah 

529.13 531.72 B: but fundamentally 

532.37 533.22 B: (( ah )) 

534.82 539.32 B: they also i think would have to use in addition to it a bit of a carrot 

539.34 542.19 B: i mean ethics are very difficult to teach 

542.11 543.93 A: mhm 

542.38 551.99 B: and i'm not too sure graduate schools ah such as ah the one we have here in town at o._g._s._m. at vanderville for example 

551.37 553.39 A: oh it's an excellent school 

552.08 555.59 B: it is they have recently started teaching ethics but 

556.20 562.27 B: i'm not too sure that you can legislate um bad behavior but you can apply 

562.94 569.08 B: instead of the carrot the stick in the sense that if enough people were locked up in prisons 

569.07 582.16 B: rather than the treatment that is normally handed out to people from a certain economic group dare i say class because someone might suggest that i was talking about class warfare um 

574.84 575.93 A: mhm 

581.53 583.01 A: no i hear you 

582.91 595.86 B: but but i have seen this i saw it at eglin air force base when i was stationed there there was a federal prison on eglin air force base and you wouldn't know it i've also been at maxwell air force base in montgomery alabama 

591.84 593.12 A: mhm 

595.44 596.45 A: come on 

595.68 599.89 B: and you wouldn't know that place was a prison because these guys are walking
