265.46 267.87 B: has anything to do with 

268.44 276.23 B: um a social aspect or not on your view of what family 'cause i hear that 

276.31 277.82 B: a lot about 

277.91 278.87 B: you 

279.06 280.99 B: know like some people do 

281.04 285.59 B: feel the same way that you do that family is like your blood connections 

286.00 287.89 B: or your next of kin 

286.09 288.80 A: maybe maybe you mean from the east 

288.75 290.13 B: i'm sorry 

289.43 294.04 A: do you mean from the east a lot of people think like i do 

293.66 295.41 B: wel- i'm um 

295.77 297.46 B: like more northern 

296.00 299.04 A: 'cause they think it's so conservative yeah conservative yeah 

298.97 303.44 B: yeah more more that it's not as um 

304.03 308.21 B: it is a more conservative view that you're 

308.28 311.58 B: more close knit you're not sharing 

311.65 313.13 B: not that you're not 

313.23 315.90 B: capable of caring or sharing 

316.09 322.73 B: [noise] just that you have a different idea [noise] of what's supposed to be personal [noise] [mn] 

322.11 329.09 A: mhm yeah and i think also um cities where people move to 

329.32 333.01 A: ah probably have the greater um ah 

334.00 346.46 A: they consider their friends as part of their family because a lot of people from the west originally was from the east and their families are back in the east 

337.65 338.64 B: right 

346.22 347.24 B: right 

346.54 351.57 A: so everybody else is in the same situation as they are 

352.61 355.20 B: that that does make sense [mn] 

354.96 366.63 A: yeah but ah you know that a- and then i think the weather has something to do with it too because in southern climates where it's warm you're outside all the time 

366.23 367.33 B: (( right )) 

366.56 375.61 A: so you're you know you meet your friends for gardening you know you meet your friends ah let's go out and do this and do that 

375.97 377.18 A: um 

377.98 385.98 A: where i guess i- i- in the east you have your like wh- where i'm born it's the sa- i live in the same city 

386.10 388.75 A: that both my grandparents lived in 

388.41 389.65 B: yeah 

390.47 393.59 B: there is not as much migrating [laughter] 

393.10 395.35 A: right exactly mhm 

394.31 396.57 B: it's more old town it's 

396.79 398.35 B: your home town 

399.04 399.98 B: since 

400.82 403.62 B: um [mn] i have one's 

403.92 406.86 B: one of my friends has lived here since she was born 

407.19 409.98 B: and the others have moved 

410.01 412.86 B: (( in since you know they were )) 

412.98 417.53 B: still small children but so their families moved here they weren't 

417.82 419.99 B: their ancestry isn't here 

419.41 427.70 A: yeah oh i see now i'm from the state pennsylvania which has the oldest population 

427.90 442.41 A: in the country other than florida so there's a second ah state that has ah the oldest population and um this isn't because people retire here this is because 

442.49 446.63 A: people tend to stay here you know in the same 

445.72 446.70 B: (( [mn] )) 

446.76 459.12 A: area where they were born and their parents were born and ah there's a certain part of south philadelphia where you have generations living in the same neighbourhood 

458.68 459.98 B: right that's 

460.57 465.22 B: that's kind of like where my grandmother lives [laughter] see where i come 

463.46 465.45 A: uh-huh where where's that 

465.46 467.78 B: um she lives in parsons kansas 

468.67 471.06 B: which is a very small city 

471.66 473.24 B: (( and um )) 

474.26 475.04 B: (( it's )) 

475.05 476.98 B: one of those places that's 

477.17 481.83 B: you're born there you very rarely move out 

481.10 482.86 A: (( uh-huh mhm right right )) 

483.85 485.82 B: (( [laughter] and )) 

484.31 489.64 A: and and that's something that philadelphia is like now 

487.73 488.57 B: (( [mn] )) 

489.64 500.59 A: i mean you have your irish section your polish section section your italian section where people have lived there for generations 

501.99 503.54 A: so you know it's 

502.12 502.95 B: ah 

503.56 508.81 A: quite different than in a in a state that receives a lot of immigrants 

509.93 514.92 A: so you you have a a big family that is wonderful 

514.10 515.55 B: yes [laughter] 

514.99 519.10 A: and that's wonderful that your husband um 

519.48 524.45 A: decided to adopt your the child of your first marriage 

524.12 524.66 B: (( ah )) 

525.09 526.38 B: he um 

526.83 527.65 B: well ah 

527.83 530.46 B: her biological father doesn't really want 

531.23 536.26 B: to have anything to do with her and my husband felt that that was just 

537.16 541.39 B: that she needed somebody and he was going to 

541.49 545.88 B: be the one to make the decisions and everything so why not it be legal 

545.43 546.45 A: uh-huh 

546.50 551.00 B: and he wanted her to feel that she was his 

550.66 553.02 A: oh that that's that's great 

553.51 554.77 B: and um 

554.91 557.14 A: how how how old are your other kids 

555.10 556.01 B: (( and after )) 

557.21 559.08 B: (( [noise] i'm sorry ))

569.30 571.32 B: (( yes [noise] )) 

571.58 575.83 A: does the older child help you with the younger 

576.29 578.19 B: she does um 

578.58 580.34 B: she gets into 

580.42 582.50 B: her own stuff and then [laughter] 

582.73 585.29 B: not wanting to help much with anything 

584.85 586.05 A: [laughter] 

586.45 592.39 B: [mn] [laughter] but um the one thing that she is mostly consistent with is the other children 

593.72 599.56 A: mhm oh well that that's great where where where did your husband come from 

596.49 597.39 B: (( [mn] and [mn] [mn] ))
