194.53 197.55 B: she's still at home and um 

197.52 201.46 B: you know i just think i guess when i think about my family i think 

201.43 214.87 B: you know i i don't know i i guess i'm kind of a very traditional person so i have a tendency to feel like my family is my job my family is my life sometimes i wonder because my daughter is fifteen years old 

206.37 206.97 A: (( mm )) 

210.44 212.67 A: yeah mhm 

214.81 225.66 B: what is my life gonna be like when she's she goes away to college because my family you know like i'm so wrapped up in them i'm home schooling and 

215.24 216.52 A: right 

219.62 221.06 A: mhm 

225.27 226.39 A: right 

225.78 235.93 B: you know my whole life is taking care of my family so i just wonder [mn] then what am i going do what am i gonna do when they're gone you know when they're all gone 

234.70 246.60 A: i understand we did home schooling uh for a couple of years and i just put my kids in a charter school last year because i feel like it's so much like home school 

246.26 247.62 B: mhm 

246.74 258.68 A: and uh my twelve year old just got kicked out of the school so i'm considering going back to home school and it was all for foolish goofy reasons i mean she didn't hurt anybody she didn't 

250.94 251.71 B: (( mm )) 

258.92 262.74 A: you know i mean just typical things that teenagers do i mean it was 

261.89 262.84 B: right 

262.95 266.02 A: it was just stupid little things that were you know 

266.30 270.66 A: i think m- m- mountains moles that were made into mountain hills but 

270.02 271.11 B: yeah 

270.98 274.39 A: so i'm considering that again i don't know what to do at this point 

274.04 276.94 B: and you said you home schooled for two years 

276.52 283.20 A: but well we did for a couple of years because we did and then we didn't and then we did you know so 

283.50 287.25 A: it kinda went back and forth [laughter] yeah 

285.07 285.94 B: (( uh-huh )) 

286.61 288.89 B: it's a big commitment but 

288.97 292.84 B: i don't know i think in in hindsight it's funny because 

292.83 305.19 B: when you're doing that and when you're investing all that time in your family you wonder am i even doing them any good sometimes you just doubt yourself but i have to say that my oldest two they're out of the house um 

296.65 297.71 A: (( mhm )) 

300.50 301.41 A: yeah 

305.75 312.13 B: would not have had it uh any other way it's funny because afterwards they'll they'll tell you you kinda get your report card 

312.17 313.14 A: yeah 

312.19 317.42 B: after it's all over but i know that particularly for my son 

317.66 330.06 B: you know he he said you know i would never send my children to school i would never do that so i think we'll that's interesting because he was the one that bucked me the most he's the one that was um 

322.29 323.47 A: (( mm [noise] )) 

323.49 324.55 A: yeah 

327.57 328.74 A: mhm 

330.41 333.47 B: you know the hardest on me and 

331.87 337.33 A: yeah so were you're kids in school at all or did you home school for the whole time 

337.13 340.18 B: um i started when he was in second grade 

340.00 342.82 A: (( mhm that's when i started with my oldest daughter )) 

340.51 342.80 B: so it's been a lot of years 

342.83 347.49 B: i've doing it so [laughter] that's why you say when i'm through 

347.82 356.08 B: you know that's what mainly my family seems to be everything that i do and when i'm through doing this job 

353.21 354.45 A: mhm 

356.22 367.58 B: i think i really often wonder what you know what am i gonna do with my life you know and it'll only be my daughter is in ninth grade so i'm only looking at three more years 

367.19 368.94 A: mhm 

367.69 374.50 B: after this and then i'm gonna have to try to figure what will i do with all that time that i spend 

374.39 377.01 A: [noise] right 

377.37 382.10 A: (( well um along kind of along the same subject [noise] )) 

382.80 385.97 A: i have a question for you about home school 

385.84 386.60 B: okay 

387.19 401.25 A: 'cause everybody does it a little bit different now were you along the lines of get up and start at eight o'clock and and you know do everything like clockwork or were you more laid back and just a relaxed schedule 

388.97 389.99 B: yeah 

401.36 406.63 B: i think i've grown to be more laid back but i it depends on the child i think you know 

403.97 405.23 A: [laughter] 

406.52 418.10 B: some of 'em you have to sit on 'em and you have to start at eight or else they're not gonna you know they won't be through till midnight 'cause you know they're gonna drag their feet you have to be more structured the one i have at home now 

412.45 413.44 A: right 

414.49 415.69 A: mhm 

418.14 428.68 B: she's pretty diligent about getting her own work done of course she's fifteen but she gets on the books and get's a lot of the work that she can do by herself she does it by herself and then 

422.25 423.57 A: mhm 

428.11 429.02 A: right 

428.83 435.29 B: um i get to um like today we're we're taking french and we're studying 

435.27 444.81 B: about french culture so today we spent the entire day at two museums in philadelphia the rodin museum and the um 

437.55 438.49 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

442.54 443.39 A: (( oh )) 

444.83 455.96 B: and there was always at the philadelphia museum of art there was a de gar exhibit so we you know just did a lot of um french art and french you know it was kinda fun but 

456.23 469.93 B: i you know i think that i got a little bit and it also depended on the subjects things like math i'm rigid it's like you know this is what you do you don't waiver from it but things like history special studies um 

460.68 461.80 A: mhm 

462.39 463.30 A: right 

463.32 464.40 A: yeah 

473.20 481.38 B: and things where you can be more creative then i'm a little bit looser you know what i mean so i think it just depends 

475.35 476.38 A: uh-huh 

478.05 479.88 A: right right 

481.83 485.19 B: and whatever fits your life best you know 

484.09 490.25 A: right now see i was i was kinda a little more relaxed when we did it before because 

490.28 492.62 A: i'm not a morning person myself 

492.24 493.14 B: right 

492.96 505.18 A: i like to get up and do things before i actually have to do anything you know [laughter] so for me for us to get up and you know do housework have breakfast clean up whatever and start at ten o'clock 

497.61 498.51 B: right 

505.44 511.35 A: that was that was fine i worked you know i could do that and we would still be done before three o'clock in the afternoon you know 

511.08 520.41 B: well yeah that's that's the key they just spend so much time in school just lining up and doing [laughter] you know what i mean it's like what a waste of time 

513.01 513.89 A: [laughter] 

516.87 524.14 A: i know i know and that's what my husband says how can you get anything done in two hours a day sometimes we'll be done by noon you know 

523.87 524.93 B: yeah 

524.14 534.15 A: i say well you know if you consider when they're at school they're in line they're going from one class to the other they spend twenty minutes getting quiet getting their books out doing this whatever in each class 

533.96 535.18 B: right 

534.31 536.30 A: and you add that all up then 

536.37 539.51 A: they're really not spending much more time than that at school anyway 

539.72 542.59 B: yep that's true it's really true 

542.85 545.23 B: i don't know i think um 

543.03 543.96 A: anyway 

544.04 545.12 A: [laughter] 

545.61 553.77 B: and you know as far as you know like this is back to the topic of family talk about being able to instill values in your own children 

548.81 549.86 A: uh-huh 

553.71 560.74 B: and you know what i mean and just not i don't know i just feel like i don't want to trust that to the school system 

555.66 556.36 A: (( yeah )) 

560.69 562.12 A: mhm 

561.07 567.74 B: you know my family is too important and like i said i did have one that did buck me oh he would have loved to have gone to school 

567.81 570.82 B: we really wrestled with him a lot 

570.32 571.79 A: mhm 

571.15 584.36 B: but now he's saying a completely different thing he's saying you know and he told as a matter of fact he told his younger sister he said if i were would have gone to school i would have gotten into so much trouble 

575.02 575.99 A: right 

584.25 599.15 A: mhm that's what i'm running into with my daughter now like i'm and i thought you know with it being this charter school that it was going to be so much like our home school by the way it's set out more along the montessori style you know and and uh 

585.01 586.15 B: you know 

596.94 598.08 B: right 

599.29 599.89 A: but
