50.56 58.56 B: see my ah children and my grandchildren and it's just it's very important i think ah to to most people i think it is

79.47 80.78 A: oh i agree 

79.58 81.13 B: for the holiday 

81.28 90.02 B: ah because i know i have people at church that don't have family and it's kinda sad i think ah for the holidays when they don't have family close 

89.74 94.43 A: i agree a hundred per cent this time in our lives my husband and i are 

91.03 92.06 B: yeah 

94.47 100.03 A: distant from our families and holidays is kind of is very hard actually mhm

108.20 109.37 A: yeah 

108.82 119.61 B: and so i at least i have the one daughter here and that really really helps a lot i think it would be tough when your kids grow up and they do move away i know it is 

119.34 120.86 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

120.02 132.00 B: and you don't have them close where you can especially with grandchildren you can spend time with them while they're growing up and to just love and nurture them and i think all children need grandparents

133.32 134.62 B: (( yes )) 

134.49 136.29 A: that's that's really true

185.02 190.77 B: my daughter in new york i don't get to see but maybe mm twice a year and that's kinda tough 

190.37 191.97 A: (( yes it's hard )) 

190.98 200.62 B: my grandchildren there are growing up and um they're thirteen and fifteen and they just grow up so fast when you don't get to spend time with them or see them 

200.70 202.28 A: yes they do 

201.87 202.90 B: yeah 

202.31 204.68 A: 'cause at that age they're it just 

204.84 206.28 A: spurt just 

205.57 206.38 B: yeah 

206.45 207.89 A: grow so fast 

207.25 208.39 B: yes 

208.52 213.13 B: so but ah i just think that of course i was raised 

213.18 218.03 B: as family being very important my grandmother had fourteen children 

217.84 219.15 A: oh wow 

218.78 227.74 B: yeah so it was just it was a big family get together on sundays at dinner and everything so i was just kinda raised around that 

225.05 226.17 A: (( yeah )) 

227.91 240.08 A: up to this day my my sister and my brother who live in the same home town as my parents they get together every weekend but i mean they're all grown up with families and they all get together every weekend right 

234.66 235.80 B: yeah 

236.80 245.00 B: that's the way my grandparents yeah uh-huh that's the way my grandparents ah when they were living that's the way it was um 

245.06 256.93 B: it's not that way so much anymore 'cause my mother's passed away now but ah when she was living well we used to go over there just about every weekend the family all got together 

256.96 260.85 A: yeah it's just to hang out i mean it's nothing special just to hang out and 

260.22 269.15 B: yeah yeah but i think times are changing i don't know i don't ah think the younger generations of the families are kind of getting away from that so 

260.99 261.87 A: [laughter] 

268.87 269.84 A: yeah 

269.57 270.77 B: i think they're miss 

269.85 270.96 A: (( everything is )) 

270.90 273.04 B: i think they're missing out on a lot 

273.14 278.78 A: i agree but life now is so busy between commuting and work and 

276.17 276.94 B: (( yeah )) 

278.13 279.18 B: it is 

278.86 282.22 A: trying to juggle the kids and work and all that stuff it's just 

279.24 280.00 B: yeah 

282.04 290.85 B: yeah both parents working and then the weekends come you know they have so many other things they have to get done before they go back to work again so 

284.46 285.30 A: right 

290.40 295.29 A: and being away from the from the grandparents too that takes a lot from the kids 

293.34 294.37 B: mhm 

294.99 297.48 B: it really does it does 

296.30 298.07 A: yeah i think so too 

297.76 302.32 B: yeah yeah 'cause i really enjoy being around 

302.65 304.25 B: my grandchildren 

304.55 308.52 A: i know and grandkids have so much to learn from the grandparents 

307.90 309.68 B: mhm yeah 

308.82 314.05 A: i used to my grandparents are passed of course but i just adore them 

314.29 318.68 B: well you get so well you get so attached to the grandkids 

318.55 319.46 A: mhm 

319.20 321.69 B: whenever they're around you know 

321.60 322.50 A: right 

322.14 322.82 B: (( it's )) 

324.16 328.28 B: and i just think it's important for them to relate that ah 

328.89 333.71 B: grandparent with part of their life and something that they'll remember 

333.75 334.64 A: yes 

334.56 339.05 B: and doing and having fun with the grandparent doing certain things 

339.66 342.00 A: and to me family's more than just a 

342.06 353.20 A: the mother the father and the kid it's more also the extended family the grandparents and the uncles and aunts and all the cousins i grew up with all my cousins and we had such a fun time

361.39 374.35 B: you know i hate to see the family kind of i think it's kind of going by the wayside but i just don't think that the families interact as much with the cousins and the getting together and the playing
