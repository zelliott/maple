73.79 74.84 A: yeah 

73.84 75.17 B: um you know 

75.27 78.03 A: but i i think it affects us 

78.06 81.03 A: personally just because of the stock market and 

81.40 87.76 A: you know personal finances that actually but it hurts it hurts every person because 

88.13 98.18 A: if you're if they're doing illegal things that causes the stock market people lose their jobs and detroit is you know a prime example because you guys have all the ah 

98.82 99.70 B: auto 

99.29 101.50 A: auto out there 

100.35 102.60 B: correct yeah 

101.53 115.77 A: yeah see we don't have we did have u._s. steel here now the only really big employer we have is u._s. air and they're pulling all kinds of really cool things with you know the because of two thousand and two 

115.72 126.46 A: and the world trade centre they're saying well travel is bad and we're one of their hubs their major hubs and all they want to pull out of their contract 

118.64 119.61 B: uh-huh 

126.50 129.67 A: with the pittsburgh nat- international airport 

130.10 135.45 B: you know and i think when things like this happen i don't i think accountability 

135.61 144.24 B: um accountability has been an issue with me in a lot of these these companies they don't seem to have the right person accountable initially 

144.01 147.88 A: no they don't no it seems like that they can 

147.95 160.09 A: we have westinghouse here and it seems like they the people that are the head of this go in take their bonuses and leave and it's almost like they're raping the count- the company 

155.48 158.70 B: right yeah and it's not fair 

159.73 167.63 B: yeah they come in with that mentality i'll go in i'll take what i can and if the company shall fall and its employees also oh well 

163.68 164.76 A: right 

167.27 169.62 A: that's that's exactly the way it is 

167.66 180.60 B: and they're they seem they be well i don't know if they are necessarily protected but it's like with all the money that they take and all the money that the company loses and as you as you stated employees losing jobs and benefits and thus for 

180.71 184.96 B: they should be held accountable to the point where they have to pay it all back and then some 

184.65 185.54 A: right 

185.23 190.73 B: and and the employees shouldn't have to suffer not to the extreme that they have been 

190.73 203.92 B: um when they have yachts and ah you know half million dollar cars and ten million dollar houses and and and and have a plane and you know all of this stuff i think i think our c._e._o.s c._f._o.s 

195.16 196.87 A: no right yeah 

197.26 198.27 A: yeah 

204.05 206.17 B: and whoever else of a o. 

206.43 209.30 B: [laughter] are living too well 

206.80 208.26 A: [laughter] 

209.41 211.79 B: on the employees you know 

210.56 213.48 A: and they're not and there isn't any accountability 

212.97 224.03 B: right there is none it's like and then you see them go they go before ah a jury of peers and what not but you can really only do so much they've already as you stated raped the company 

223.49 228.66 A: yeah and so and then they walk away and they're clear and free and they just go to another company yeah 

228.06 238.70 B: right but they've lived the life off of you and i and then the stock market will plunge because they ah doctored the books or had ten sets of books and [laughter] 

238.72 252.34 B: by the time a firm accounting is done of all the the the matters that went on in company a like you say it falters now they're at company b. but they've lived the millionaire life at company a 

252.23 255.89 B: and take that cavalier attitude to company b. and 

255.96 261.22 B: the people who hire them you would think you would think that they would say well wait a minute 

260.86 274.12 A: i don't think so i think no i think because i think those people are at the same level and probably doing the same type of thing and because one for example westinghouse was mike eisner who was ah disney 

262.06 263.23 B: [laughter] 

266.32 267.43 B: okay 

274.34 275.34 B: okay 

274.77 288.94 A: and so he was a disney and then he moved to westinghouse and westinghouse then was bought out by c._b._s. and then c._b._s. like pulled out of pittsburgh 'cause my husband works for them and you know he was forced into an early retirement 

289.35 292.38 A: and he didn't want to do that he was only fifty five 

292.66 300.15 A: but you know we were lucky he's been given a very small pension and you know our benefits are covered to a certain extent 

292.99 294.07 B: oh 

299.89 301.00 B: okay 

300.33 306.39 A: but you know and he was able to get another job so we're fine we landed on our feet but other people weren't 

306.31 307.34 B: right 

306.75 310.71 A: you know and so and now michael eisner has gone and he's somewhere else 

311.39 315.25 A: and so it you know and he'll be doing the same thing to another company 

315.54 317.65 A: and i think that just isn't 

318.25 320.29 B: it's not right 

319.13 322.59 A: no it's not it's not ethical and i 

321.81 325.83 B: do you think that i i don't i don't know if um 

325.89 327.99 B: i think the the the 

328.18 342.21 B: i guess front line employees bear down to low to to do something significant but by themselves but how can we come together collectively maybe because it would then would within a company or within 

334.97 336.07 A: i think so 

342.37 349.08 B: across across the board across companies and say that we need to have this come to a stop 

349.12 350.65 A: we have 

350.84 354.05 A: um at work we have what we call 

354.43 358.48 A: an advisory board which is made up of 

358.61 361.80 A: big executives from different companies 

362.01 365.67 A: and they come in and spend three days with us 

365.81 368.33 A: and they go through everything 

368.36 381.44 A: they go through your books they talk to employees um you know and you have to be honest with them and they look to see how many minorities you've hired and you know what your budget is and i think maybe 

381.34 386.52 A: companies a lot of other companies should do this and then they go and they 

386.60 389.07 A: take what they have done 

389.10 394.90 A: and they put this into a report and they turn this over to our c._e._o. and they come in 

395.30 397.27 A: once every three years 

397.24 398.21 B: mhm 

397.90 402.64 A: and so even though three years is a long time between 

402.91 405.47 A: it kind of makes things 

405.98 408.12 A: a little more honest 

408.01 411.15 B: but does it keep the c._e._o. on the on the 

411.36 414.06 B: honest ethical moral track 

414.24 417.44 B: is this assuming that the c._e._o. is not crooked 

417.75 425.04 A: um no i don't think it is and our our people our management people only get a five year contract 

425.36 426.11 B: oh 

425.54 429.75 A: so after five years the head of our department 

429.78 436.94 A: is he can renew his contract if other people vote for him to renew his contract otherwise he's out 

435.74 436.70 B: oh 

437.80 438.67 B: (( i mean you )) 

438.06 442.32 A: so if he's not doing a good job in five years you know 

442.54 445.39 A: they have the option and i've been there 

445.94 453.75 A: twelve years fourteen years and i have been through one two three four five department heads 

454.04 459.88 A: because some of them have stepped on and you know and some of them their contracts just haven't been renewed 

454.04 454.76 B: (( know mm )) 

460.24 467.23 A: and so maybe other companies should look at something like that you get a five year contract there are no bonuses unless 

467.88 472.04 A: stockholders and you know employees are getting their 

470.24 471.66 B: right 

472.06 473.64 A: what they need 

472.09 481.19 B: yeah yeah i would think so too i i think ah one of the biggest industries that probably should do that is the telcom industries telecommunication 

480.67 481.69 A: mhm 

481.46 486.28 B: they really should because their top people are always 

486.85 496.58 B: well compensated for a job not so well done it doesn't you know and the employees are the ones that really get the shaft on that 

496.76 503.89 B: always 'cause they come in with these horrendous like they call it um bonuses to come 

497.45 498.24 A: yeah 

503.03 503.93 A: oh 

503.85 512.73 B: and then if they do you know so well then they get additional bonuses and um meanwhile the employees aren't getting anything 

512.98 523.46 B: they're paying more [laughter] they pay more for their own benefits they get less in raises yet um and their company seem to keep going down and those those ah 

516.08 516.94 A: right 

523.63 528.33 B: industries weigh heavily in the stock market as well and i think that's probably why 

528.37 531.14 B: ah a big part of it 

531.25 533.71 B: won't come back [laughter] because 

533.06 540.55 A: right i think so too i mean that's why the steel industry one of the reasons that the steel industry failed so miserably in pittsburgh 

540.56 543.23 A: because i mean we were steel 

543.18 556.88 A: and you know it was just one thing after another and now the latest one is and there's no accountability and that's the problem l._t._v. steel just said well our retirees we can't afford benefits for them any more oh well 

557.22 561.10 A: and so now all these people who have worked thirty or forty years in the mill 

561.36 563.08 A: you know now have no 

561.53 562.54 B: right 

563.16 564.41 A: health insurance 

564.69 571.66 B: and that's not fair but have you noticed the c._e._o.s and what not those those people way high up they have they always have health insurance for life 

571.55 573.88 A: oh yes yeah that's true 

572.61 578.79 B: they have it for life and they've been they come to the company anywhere from six months to six years i mean it's it's never really long 

578.44 580.99 A: (( no no none of them stay too long )) 

579.24 584.28 B: but they are taken care of for life and this is at multiple companies 

583.57 584.81 A: that's yeah yeah 

584.64 589.41 B: they have multiple ranges of dinner sets available to them where the little people 

589.59 593.06 B: still are suffering because of their mishandling 

593.19 594.69 B: years later 

594.39 599.95 A: so i think there has to be some accountability in whether it's at the government level or a company
