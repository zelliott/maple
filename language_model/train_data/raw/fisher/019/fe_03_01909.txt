10.55 11.57 B: oh okay 

12.76 14.41 A: so family 

14.26 18.72 B: yeah family not just another word right [laughter] 

18.34 27.78 A: yeah um i don't know well i guess sometimes i think that family is just the people that are related to you but a lot of times 

26.71 27.75 B: (( well that's the most )) 

27.97 28.97 B: (( that's the most )) 

28.00 30.18 A: i feel like what 

28.99 32.36 B: that's the most simple that's the most simple definition yeah 

32.28 37.18 A: yeah but i definitely have found out that a lot of times family is like 

37.58 51.65 A: more about people that you can rely on and i know a lot of people who um are uh queer or homosexual who define family as the people that they can count on to be their allies 

51.29 52.06 B: (( mm )) 

52.53 61.14 B: yeah i see that and there's all kinds of communities i think uh like the people in the community you know are just as much family as anyone who would be related to 'em by blood you know 

61.42 67.16 A: right do you have people that you call like uncle and aunt and stuff that aren't in your family 

67.22 71.40 B: not really but i'm not particularly close with my blood family so 

71.93 76.38 B: i don't i mean like i'm more i'm closer with my friends i consider them 

73.66 74.22 A: (( [noise] )) 

77.16 81.46 B: well maybe like at least equal to my blood family so 

80.91 82.52 A: mhm 

82.23 84.51 B: and it's it's pretty much always been that way 

84.95 86.80 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

85.51 86.82 B: for me 

87.34 94.50 A: yeah i definitely have a lot of people that i grew up with in my life that um were like my parents' fraternity 

94.68 97.99 A: brothers and stuff like that and i grew up 

97.70 98.43 B: (( [noise] )) 

98.12 100.79 A: with my extended family really far away 

100.81 112.35 A: so my father's especially fraternity brothers became like uncles and their wives like aunts and i call their kids my cousins and i hang out with them like they're my cousins so 

112.55 118.78 B: well the only thing i had like that was when i was younger and one of my mom's best friends called herself my aunt you know 

118.98 121.09 A: mhm [noise] 

119.73 123.78 B: and her her daughter was my cousin you know so 

123.84 127.01 A: yeah yeah 

125.31 128.56 B: yeah of course i didn't choose that they chose that but you know 

128.32 129.54 A: [laughter] 

129.60 130.57 A: [noise] 

130.64 136.41 A: yeah i don't know i guess now i definitely have like friends that i have 

136.26 145.97 A: friends that i have been friends with for a really long time that i think of as family and oh were you know we can go months and months without talking 

138.03 138.81 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

146.16 152.82 A: and it'll still be the same kind of connection when we talk again even though a lot of time has passed 

151.92 165.71 B: mhm right that's the exact same kind of thing i have with my friends 'cause i just moved a couple of years ago and i still i talk to them you know maybe maybe once or twice a month maybe and i still feel real close to them i know when i go back there it will be just like i never left almost 

156.41 157.72 A: mhm 

165.63 178.19 A: yeah i guess yeah [laughter] i hope [laughter] a lot of times [laughter] i think i count on that but then i'm like oh wait maybe it's not enough or a few too many months for some people 

166.47 167.38 B: so 

169.79 170.85 B: [laughter] 

172.78 173.79 B: you hope 

177.07 177.85 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

178.63 179.73 A: [laughter] 

179.92 184.86 B: sometimes the time and distance really do make uh i'm not sure of the impact they have but 

179.96 181.12 A: yeah 

184.91 186.81 B: i don't think it's gonna happen in my case 

187.16 188.34 A: yeah 

188.67 189.64 B: (( [mn] so )) 

188.83 191.38 A: uh where did you relocate from 

191.45 195.49 B: uh tacole washington about thirty miles south of seattle 

195.58 197.23 A: oh [noise] 

197.19 203.24 B: but uh yeah that's where my my god- my godkids are [laughter] i have uh 

201.88 203.08 A: mhm 

203.21 213.15 B: a god a goddaughter and a godson they're my best friends kids so that's another kind of definition for the use of family i suppose is you know you have godparents or something like that 

205.44 206.57 A: mhm 

212.89 217.07 A: yeah my family became um estranged from 

213.85 214.78 B: (( [noise] )) 

217.51 219.94 A: like the people that were my godparents 

220.20 233.95 A: and uh it was really weird like i and their uh the people that are my godparents their children have my parents as their godparents and we ended up they needed up liking getting in a business dispute [noise] and 

234.07 237.40 A: we stopped talking to them completely and that was like 

234.45 235.24 B: (( mm oh )) 

237.41 246.93 A: really weird because they definitely were good enough friends at one point so wanna include them in the family like equally both parties are so 

247.30 249.12 A: (( i don't know that was kinda weird )) 

248.52 252.77 B: uh-huh yes i guess the family's kind fluid [laughter] kinda change 

252.95 254.76 B: can change based on events and 

253.08 255.41 A: yeah 

255.33 257.17 B: (( whatnot yeah )) 

256.03 257.22 A: yeah 

260.80 262.78 B: (( but uh yeah i don't know i mean )) 

263.28 264.93 B: i wonder how many people 

265.19 269.75 B: do just think of families as the people who raised i'm mean my girlfriend she's really into her family 

269.53 271.37 A: mhm 

270.30 272.82 B: you know a lot a lot more than i am into my 

272.94 274.50 B: family family 

274.63 276.51 A: yeah 

276.56 282.47 B: um i don't know how many people really do think of fam- just their blood relations as their only family you 

282.85 285.90 A: yeah i don't know i definitely like 

283.00 283.66 B: (( know )) 

287.55 288.68 A: (( i don't know )) 

288.39 290.89 B: [mn] maybe it's a trend with with younger people i 

290.90 294.89 B: don't know to you know have a wider wider definition of family 

292.42 293.24 A: well 

294.79 299.90 A: yeah well i think especially in the united states since everybody's so mobile 

298.07 298.72 B: (( uh-huh )) 

300.28 312.99 A: like i mean it's not uncommon for you know move from like all the way out in the washington to texas and you know to have people scattered everywhere that you know kind of become your family based on 

312.82 319.03 A: distance and who's around and like geographically who's available to fill in those family types of traditions 

318.74 320.07 B: yeah that's true 

319.07 319.93 A: and 

320.04 323.72 A: i think like those people like in 

323.99 327.97 A: maybe in different parts of the world where you're around 

328.12 335.89 A: your family your entire life and um the population isn't as mobile you tend to stick with blood relation with your family much more 

336.91 342.22 A: [noise] but i guess in a lot tim- a lot of times like the community is an extension of your family maybe 

342.49 348.28 A: based on the fact that your family isn't there a lot of the time and they maybe are blood relatives 

345.33 346.29 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

348.30 358.84 B: i don't know it seems kind of opposite for me and my girlfriend my girlfriend her parents worked overseas all the time she really loves 'em and wants to be with them all the time but i lived with my parents and well i didn't 

359.08 361.53 B: feel very close to them so i mean they were 

361.66 365.31 B: great parents i guess in terms of providing but you know 

365.44 366.61 A: mhm 

365.55 368.83 B: didn't have to feel close to them but it's the reverse for 

369.00 370.39 B: my girlfriend though 

370.81 372.26 B: kinda interesting 

372.46 373.55 A: yeah 

372.58 373.73 B: so uh 

373.78 375.01 B: um so 

374.13 374.82 A: well 

375.10 376.11 B: oh go ahead 

376.28 380.21 A: oh well i was gonna say i didn't really become close with my parents until i 

380.28 382.32 A: moved far away from them [laughter] 

381.89 383.67 B: [laughter] really 

383.59 388.12 A: well i think it was a matter of being able to choose when i communicated with them 

388.78 398.55 A: and if i didn't wanna talk with them i could choose not to answer the phone [laughter] rather than having to uh see them every time i went to walk out the door 

398.61 399.28 B: (( mhm )) 

399.86 404.40 B: yeah well i think my girlfriend was away from her parents during her teenage years a 

404.19 405.04 A: mhm 

404.46 407.21 B: lot maybe that helped [laughter] 

407.05 409.13 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

408.02 418.32 B: okay what about closeness do you think you have to be close to someone you consider family i mean 'cause you know i'm not particularly close with my blood relations but i they're family i guess 

419.09 421.32 A: well i don't know um 

421.41 422.46 A: i 

422.60 428.64 A: [noise] i'm definitely at a point where i feel like it's real important to be close with people especially my mother 

425.27 425.90 B: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

429.62 438.53 A: but i think that's because her relationship with her mother was really tied and i know that like she needs to have that replicated in our relationship 

439.01 445.26 A: but i know a lot of people who aren't close with their family and they're just close with other people as a result 

445.61 447.38 A: i think you need to be close with 

447.20 451.45 A: some people in the same way that you'd be close with blood relatives 

451.44 462.39 A: or as traditionally perceived as how you would be close with blood relatives because you you need some sort of support system like i'm sure that you have a different kind of support system that's outside of your family 

462.22 463.66 B: (( mm uh-huh yeah well )) 

463.74 465.82 B: all my friends but you know 

466.81 467.37 A: (( [noise] )) 

467.10 468.05 B: (( i don't know )) 

468.75 470.86 B: i don't have that much of a support here 

471.14 473.08 A: (( yeah )) 

471.21 474.12 B: you know don't have much of a family here never really 

474.54 476.44 B: been too social since i've been here 

477.32 481.06 B: just work a lo- just work a lot and hang with my girlfriend [laughter] 

477.35 478.86 A: yeah 

480.72 482.73 A: well you've got your girlfriend 

482.39 484.46 B: yeah that's something [laughter] 

484.03 491.54 A: [laughter] well maybe right now you're in a place where your life isn't so complicated that you need a huge support system 

492.37 497.12 B: mm that could be true that could be true i suppose and maybe i would have looked for it if i needed it 

497.19 501.59 A: yeah i think and you definitely like seek it out when you need it although some people 

501.68 505.34 A: just kind shrug off any closeness with any people 

505.32 506.54 B: yeah that's true 

505.55 506.87 A: but 

506.65 511.57 B: yeah i think uh i think family's becoming less and less important these days too to a lot of people 

511.84 521.29 B: i mean even even including the definition of really close people like i i just keep getting the impression there's a lot of people out there who really like to be loners and don't mind but [mn] you know 

511.87 513.66 A: yeah 

521.73 523.48 A: yeah 

522.75 523.66 B: (( uh-huh )) 

524.51 526.95 A: i don't know i well i definitely 

527.40 532.30 A: uh uh a one of those people like my family's definitely really important to me right now 

532.35 540.33 A: i definitely have like chosen to live where i do because this is where i grew and i don't want to move away from my family and i 

540.35 549.78 A: don't wanna be really far away from them and thinking about grad school and stuff like i'm like oh my god i might be on a different coast like that would be really weird [laughter] 

549.90 551.75 B: yeah no i wanna go back to where i'm from 

551.77 554.71 B: that's where all my friend family is [laughter] 

554.43 561.86 A: yeah [laughter] it's hard though it's hard to be like in a different place because you don't have the associations with it that 

556.04 557.03 B: (( so )) 

561.75 562.93 B: (( no you don't )) 

562.37 568.08 A: that you do in the place where you grew up or even just the place where you spent a large portion of your time 

568.11 578.63 A: like i from my college in boston i can see the building that my father works in 'cause it's like it's like a really tall building i can see it out the window from my classroom 

570.60 571.21 B: (( [noise] )) 

578.76 580.37 A: (( it's pretty crazy )) 

580.13 582.40 B: wow that is close [laughter] 

581.51 583.43 A: [laughter] yeah it's super close 

583.53 589.10 A: but it's not it's not bad though i mean it's like we don't have to force 

583.55 584.48 B: (( [noise] )) 

589.37 599.89 A: being together 'cause it's just like it's convenient sometimes and if i want to c- go to my parents house for dinner or something like that and it's nice to know that that's there 

597.45 598.68 B: yeah talk about it
