85.03 86.84 A: but they're my family 

86.34 99.38 B: well yes [laughter] they're yours and they may depend on you so that's that's a nice thing 'cause i'm older generation and our you know we grew up mother stayed home and took care of the children 

87.46 90.93 A: you know yeah um right um 

99.29 101.46 B: fathers were the breadwinners but 

101.62 109.80 B: in the last twenty or thirty years things have broadened and changed you know and become so oh mobile 

109.37 110.37 A: right 

109.95 122.31 B: that there is a value there of the mother being the primary influence during infancy and up to you know i guess teenage or 

122.77 123.68 A: right 

123.41 125.47 B: lower teenage 

124.31 128.49 A: especially with boys the father steps in about the young teen years 

127.63 133.37 B: yeah you know twelve thirteen fourteen and then suddenly the mother is the pain [laughter] 

132.00 135.22 A: right oh mom don't let you do nothing and 

134.51 135.92 B: [laughter] 

135.27 140.29 A: or mom's scared that we're gonna get hurt or yeah then yeah you're right it does 

139.20 148.82 B: well yeah mother's are very very protective and then there's this sort of slide for the young boy to go and identify with the male part of the family 

148.46 149.81 A: exactly 

149.28 153.02 B: and there are so many families now that have 

153.10 154.82 B: no male 

156.81 159.03 B: (( i'm trying to think of the word [lipsmack] )) 

160.45 165.19 B: not idol but no influence you know positive role model 

162.69 163.64 A: model 

164.66 166.02 A: right right 

165.96 177.16 B: and getting back to the family you know family to me is the same as you family is your wife or your parents or her parents and your children and in my case grandchildren 

170.40 170.96 A: (( [cough] )) 

177.52 185.16 B: in the family unit but i think in a broader sense it's also community um 

185.30 188.99 B: you know your society you talk about the family of man 

189.43 192.50 B: or the family of man and woman 

192.62 197.29 B: it i- it can be a broader sense it could be a religion 

197.69 200.99 A: right right right yeah [sigh] 

197.71 200.09 B: you know your family 

200.49 206.09 B: um i'm just trying to think of different uses of the word family because it could be it could be 

207.08 210.57 B: (( as you said a very inanimate )) 

211.34 212.29 B: um 

212.45 222.03 B: group or it can be inanimate or philosophical we belong to you know everybody belongs to the same family in the widest general sense 

215.84 216.97 A: right i 

221.78 227.64 A: right now see i belong to um [lipsmack] i belong to like a message board online

234.69 241.54 B: you know i've never done that and uh i use the computer a lot but i've never tried that 

234.73 236.00 A: we connect 

241.12 251.18 A: yeah it's it's neat um we've we've you know it's easier sometimes it's easier to explain something like that to someone that

265.61 279.15 A: so it's easy sometimes it's easier um we kind of use it as our counseling section you know um [laughter] we don't have to go to therapy because we can we can hash out all our problems online with our friends 

272.97 274.46 B: well that's a that's a 

278.44 283.50 B: well now that's that's a good idea because you're getting a support group and also a 

283.49 293.58 B: very very experienced group maybe some of the people have gone through some of the things that you're you're questioning or you know want to know about 

286.05 288.06 A: exactly exactly 

293.16 294.23 A: right 

293.67 296.48 B: and they can give you a different point of view or 

296.76 299.48 B: at least an alternate point of view 

299.20 305.67 A: yeah yeah i have a friend that um i have a young teen daughter 

305.52 316.17 A: um and she has a daughter that is just getting out of teens going into adulthood and i look to her for a lot of advice because she has gone through this

357.63 358.81 B: (( wow )) 

358.23 369.57 A: and this year we're hoping to make it bigger but we actually got to see each other and we knew that these weren't big old truck drivers you know this actually was the mother of the teenage girl who we were talking about you know 

364.86 366.33 B: [laughter] 

369.01 370.58 B: it was all real 

370.23 376.76 A: right and i i just did the same thing again i went to visit some relatives in k- it's amazing the people the meet 

376.78 387.09 A: that are so close to you or who have such similarities how the internet makes the world so small you know it's your family 

384.06 385.33 B: oh it does 

387.64 396.25 A: you can call i can call my dad in california and it makes the world a little smaller i can get online and i meet somebody that lives two hours away from me 

396.30 408.42 A: and it makes the little world a little smaller you know and the girl that i had met i met a girl online at my message board we talk about family a lot on the board and she was only fourteen 

397.98 400.09 B: sure it does sure it does 

408.03 409.13 B: oh gosh 

408.59 419.18 A: and so i set her up with my daughter to be pen pals and i found out that she lives in newton kansas where i go to visit three four five times a year 

412.39 413.07 B: (( oh )) 

418.60 419.69 B: my gosh 

419.22 423.69 A: and so i was able to meet her here a couple months ago and my daughter was able to meet her 

423.79 429.31 A: and so that was really neat and it was it was kind of friendly 'cause the shoe was on the other foot because 

429.66 437.39 A: when i met her you know she's fourteen her dad is her dad was a minister and so i met her at ch- at her church 

432.64 433.66 B: (( mhm [laughter] [mn] )) 

437.30 445.00 A: and at the time i'm thinking you know why don't she give us her phone number and all well she can't give me her phone number she's only fourteen she doesn't really know who i am 

444.58 445.82 B: yeah 

445.13 450.93 A: you know so she had the protection of her family there and that was really interesting 

450.69 460.26 B: well yeah you know i'll have to try that while you were talking i was thinking about family i come from a very large family i had nine brothers and sisters 

459.67 460.81 A: wow 

460.69 461.83 B: (( and so )) 

462.16 470.63 B: i had and my wife she was an only child but we had through my siblings 

470.92 477.62 B: ah i was the youngest so i had older sisters and older brothers and so they went through 

472.60 473.54 A: uh-huh 

478.00 480.91 B: a lot of the stages and things that we went through 

481.18 483.09 B: you know they'd already been through 

483.28 490.53 B: and so i you were talking to your online family i guess i well we didn't have computers in those days 

489.51 491.22 A: right right 

490.74 493.91 B: so we were lucky in that we had enough 

494.19 497.72 B: of my brothers and sisters to talk to and say you know 

497.93 509.75 B: what what do you do about this and when my wife first became pregnant she had never gone through it or had anyone that had gone through it so my sisters were very valuable to her and that's family 

499.57 500.54 A: right 

509.23 515.89 A: her mom would have had her opinions from twenty some years before whereas your sisters were right 

512.87 514.29 B: exactly 

515.92 524.69 A: i have one sister and but my mum and my dad came well my mum came from a family of seven my dad came from a family of four 

524.76 533.26 A: but i was raised born and raised in california and my mum had mum and dad moved out here in about nineteen fifty six 

528.39 529.18 B: (( ahah )) 

533.21 536.41 A: and i was born in sixty six well 

536.36 549.19 A: all of my relatives still live back here in kansas so we would come visit maybe every four five years but i didn't have any quote family in california except for my mum my dad and my sister 

539.50 540.66 B: (( oh i see )) 

548.57 552.97 B: oh i see so you were really just growing up with one sibling 

549.52 550.49 A: so when 

552.42 563.76 A: right right and then when i when i got older and here just about five years ago we moved out here to the midwest so that i could be around my family 

563.93 573.00 A: and after i've been around them for four or five years now i can understand why my dad moved from california [laughter] you know it's the patent 

569.30 571.77 B: (( [laughter] )) 

573.01 575.69 A: place gossipy type thing you know that 

575.02 576.63 B: (( oh yeah )) 

575.70 586.02 A: most relatives that that live close to each other that never move away it's that type of environment and i'm not used to that you know 

584.48 587.99 B: well california is so liquid and so 

589.33 597.01 B: i say everything's on wheels you know it's just the mobility of people here i heard a um 

591.32 592.45 A: right 

597.75 599.89 B: (( a television or maybe it was a radio commer- ))
