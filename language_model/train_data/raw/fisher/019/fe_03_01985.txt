4.18 5.91 B: hi i'm anne 

5.90 6.69 A: uh-huh 

6.80 9.32 B: um did you hear the topic 

9.19 16.73 A: it said something about the topic was ah what the government could do to um curb illegal activity in businesses 

15.45 16.95 B: right right 

16.98 19.10 B: how do you feel about that 

19.02 23.49 A: [sigh] how they can curb it they could slap ah heavy duty fines on them 

23.64 24.66 B: right 

23.83 27.01 A: and they can throw the c._e._o.s in jail 

26.63 28.76 B: well they've been doing a lot of that 

28.43 29.45 A: right 

29.35 31.84 B: um enron and 

32.29 41.04 B: the some of the other the banks have been ah you know a lot of the bank c._e._o.s have been putting are you in ah north east 

32.40 33.57 A: this is true 

37.18 38.04 A: right 

40.65 43.07 A: ah yes well i'm in north carolina 

42.76 49.50 B: oh okay because i'm in maryland and we've had a few banks and the bank c._e._o.s that were arrested 

50.22 53.09 B: and because of ill you know illegal activity 

52.74 53.65 A: right 

53.95 57.49 A: we've had that problem in the research triangle part um 

57.58 59.85 A: with some of the companies um 

60.77 61.89 A: and 

62.45 73.75 A: you know i guess catching them is the hardest part but you know if they could take the money and we've we've had problems with them dipping into people's retirement funds 

73.63 74.99 B: what do you mean we 

74.74 76.79 A: ah in this area 

76.24 77.09 B: oh 

76.94 87.36 A: not me personally but in this area of them taking the retirement money and investing it poorly and then um 

78.03 78.79 B: (( oh )) 

87.41 88.64 B: like the banks 

87.68 90.41 A: getting away with it and the and the poor people that 

90.44 93.73 A: they just don't have anything left for retirement 

92.21 93.07 B: right 

93.88 102.74 A: um the only thing they they can do that the government they can publicize when people get in trouble and slap fines on them and send them to jail 

103.43 107.33 B: how do you fine the people to begin with how do you 

106.51 114.78 A: well that's also a problem because unfortunately sometimes people the employees are afraid to speak up because something bad will happen to them 

114.48 115.69 B: right 

115.26 119.22 A: and there almost needs to be some type of 

119.50 123.26 A: anonymity to the squealers 

123.13 124.58 B: mhm 

123.94 130.48 A: or a reward um if if you do see some bad things or should be maybe get a percentage 

130.54 132.70 A: of whatever 

132.85 134.94 A: amount of money that has been 

135.05 148.63 A: done wrongly i know i._b._m. a long time ago had and i'm sure they still do an incentive program if you've come up with a great idea to save money you get a percentage of how ever much it is that you save the company 

136.47 137.45 B: mhm 

147.95 149.49 B: yes that's a good idea 

148.85 156.90 A: and they could do the same thing with squealers instead of them feeling fearful is if you find something wrong with your company 

156.20 159.27 B: yeah they probably lose their jobs because 

158.31 159.66 A: they probably do 

159.38 163.60 B: because they would be reporting like their boss you know 

163.46 164.50 A: right 

164.78 165.79 B: and ah 

165.89 176.16 A: in the long run there should be some type of reward for those who come forward i mean erin um broderick out in california or silkwood a long time ago when those 

176.22 179.90 A: i think the ladies unfortunately lost their lives when cher was in that movie 

179.67 180.71 B: mhm 

179.96 184.25 A: there should be some type of reward system for those who 

184.40 189.07 A: um tell 'cause that's the only way you're going to find out about it is if someone inside 

189.40 191.31 A: telling what happened 

190.72 191.88 B: right 

192.69 193.49 A: um 

193.06 196.24 B: does this affect you directly um 

196.02 197.84 A: as far as these press things 

196.51 198.67 B: these scandals yeah these 

198.03 201.48 A: no no i'm in in education 

199.09 200.64 B: me either 

201.26 202.96 B: uh-huh are you a teacher 

201.59 208.69 A: although they're they're cutting back like crazy and trying to get rid of jobs yet they say we're screaming we need teachers 

208.38 209.76 B: mhm 

208.95 212.88 A: you can't scream you need teachers and and then lay off 

213.07 215.80 A: almost eight hundred of 'em this year 

215.53 216.32 B: (( mm )) 

216.00 219.24 A: and ah in order to have a budget cut 

219.62 220.44 A: um 

220.95 230.38 A: but i think also the government as far as for instance it john edwards running for government they're look- i mean running for president they're now saying he's getting 

230.14 231.31 B: what's his name 

231.02 233.72 A: ah john edwards the young senator 

232.34 233.21 B: uh-huh 

233.75 234.97 B: oh i didn't hear 

234.53 244.44 A: he's a democrat trying to run for ah president he's in his forties from north carolina and now they're saying he um has received some money 

238.12 239.64 B: from north carolina 

239.96 240.88 B: uh-huh 

244.60 249.08 A: um from large companies illegally and you know 

247.02 247.93 B: (( mm )) 

248.90 252.77 B: yeah a lot of that happens in politics too you know 

252.12 263.18 A: right it doesn't stop just in business it's got to go on to ah the government also when the government does wrong they've got to get in trouble as well as the military 

257.24 258.21 B: right 

259.40 260.68 B: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

263.24 265.60 A: um the military is bad about 

265.68 270.97 A: spending money wrongfully and they have a better way of hiding things than 

271.25 274.02 A: i think companies and governments 

274.25 276.35 A: they're even bigger on hush hush 

276.11 277.15 B: oh yeah 

276.38 278.02 A: on keeping their secrets 

277.37 278.52 B: you think so 

278.42 279.61 A: i think so 

279.20 280.37 B: mhm 

280.48 281.80 B: the military 

281.42 284.07 A: i think so with the female 

282.90 285.37 B: like the department of defence you 

284.76 293.99 A: um just military in general you know the way they they treat the females or you know the hazing that they had down at saluda in south carolina 

287.03 287.92 B: (( mean )) 

293.87 294.92 B: mhm 

294.33 298.97 A: doing things that to me are illegal you know harassing women 

299.12 300.08 A: um 

300.23 303.54 A: making them do things that they should not have to do um 

305.32 314.01 A: you know selling themselves trying to move up there's there's just got to be a way for someone to squeal but then it's your word against their word 

307.66 308.60 B: right 

313.81 314.92 B: (( right )) 

314.32 318.23 A: and somehow i guess in a court of law it's the only way they can solve the problem 

319.05 320.80 A: have you ever done these things before 

320.31 321.96 B: no [laughter] 

320.88 322.50 A: (( this is my first time too )) 

322.04 327.53 B: yeah i had i looked up the topics 'cause i didn't know what kind of topics you know 

327.27 328.31 A: right 

327.62 332.37 B: they cover so i wanted to see and this is not one of the ones that was listed 

333.03 335.76 B: but um did you look up the topics 

335.48 341.28 A: i i get the email and i printed it out and i have not read all the directions 

339.47 340.31 B: (( oh )) 

340.79 346.31 B: yeah there are about twenty topics or more no more than twenty i think there are forty topics actually 

346.07 346.99 A: wow 

347.81 355.72 B: they range all you know all different kinds of politics and smoking and food and all different kinds of things 

355.10 355.98 A: right 

355.80 356.94 B: um 

358.73 362.88 B: do they tell you when the time's up [laughter] 

360.79 362.13 A: i have no idea 

362.96 367.29 B: i think i think they do but i'm not sure and then you respond to some 

367.64 369.29 A: questions afterwards 

368.62 369.91 B: yeah 

370.29 374.05 B: so you know i'm not sure how that works either this is my first time 

374.80 376.17 B: but um 

376.67 379.49 B: you know this whole thing with the scandals you know 

382.03 382.94 B: (( i mean )) 

382.71 385.37 A: well just because the um 

385.21 388.96 B: i think the higher you get you know it's so tempting 

389.63 395.01 A: it's very tempting but also it seems like the higher you get in if you're more in the public eye you don't get 

395.35 402.82 A: penalized if you're the common person if you're the common person they seem to throw the book at you whereas sometimes when you are on a pedestal 

403.18 404.70 A: they they don't 

404.89 405.92 B: well they 

405.96 408.19 B: they are you know like i said they 

408.44 411.65 B: put a lot of these c._e._o.s they arrested them 

412.41 416.82 B: um but you know to get where they where they are 

417.12 422.95 B: i mean they had to have a lot of connections and you know to get to their position 

422.76 425.50 A: exactly and sometimes they start off 

425.70 431.77 A: with a lot of good but then unfortunately sometimes they owe someone a favor 

426.75 427.85 B: right 

431.38 432.36 B: right 

431.94 434.25 A: which may not be a good favor 

433.90 435.30 B: yeah 

434.53 441.99 A: because they got in a position where they're not supposed to be but the bottom line is you've you've got to pay for whatever crime as you commit 

441.68 454.14 B: mhm and like i forgot his name but the one in um maryland where i live um as bank c._e._o. i mean he meant to do right you now he was investing people's money 

446.56 447.44 A: (( mhm )) 

450.83 451.77 A: right 

454.18 457.99 B: but he made a poor choice in investing the money 

455.82 456.64 A: right 

458.32 463.29 B: so they you know they're saying that he did it you know intentionally and that he 

463.56 468.62 B: but i mean he really intended to invest people you know people's money in the right thing 

466.71 467.57 A: right 

468.69 472.31 B: he made a poor choice and he lost a lot of money for people 

472.55 478.89 B: so is that something he should be arrested for you know if he made a poor choice but his intentions were good 

477.30 478.13 A: right 

478.74 481.55 A: well actually he's not going to harm society by 

481.81 483.64 A: being on the street 

483.71 484.67 B: right 

484.01 486.85 A: but there has to be some type of 

486.42 493.78 B: but he right but he lost a lot i mean maybe he can just you know repay them but how do you repay 

487.07 488.11 A: penalty 

493.20 494.20 A: (( yeah )) 

493.86 496.95 B: you know i mean how do you repay millions of dollars 

497.94 499.37 B: so um 

500.13 502.25 B: no a lot of questions you know 

503.62 508.43 A: well i guess if one way to keep things from going sour is 

508.81 512.91 A: usually and i guess here it is the c._e._o. you you have to have a board 

512.92 522.48 A: that's managing the c._e._o. and and questioning and approving whatever it is they do so that the c._e._o. does not get in a position like that 

522.01 524.28 B: right where he has so much power 

524.00 529.36 A: right so usually even a even a c._e._o. in some companies have a board 

529.19 530.50 B: mhm 

529.37 532.20 A: that watch i mean it's like the president 

532.15 534.04 B: (( i was just going to say that yes )) 

532.39 533.31 A: he can't 

533.34 536.24 A: do anything without some approval 

534.38 535.38 B: but see the 

535.95 542.04 B: but see the president look what he's done with iraq you know he didn't really have a lot of support 

539.03 539.91 A: right 

542.42 544.38 B: and he did it anyway 

543.99 545.11 A: this is true 

544.86 546.93 B: and that's what a lot of the people 

547.59 552.85 B: are complaining about you know that he went ahead without much you know he had like 

553.00 555.50 B: colin powell behind him 

555.74 559.46 B: you know but he didn't really have everybody's even a majority 

560.05 563.05 B: of support and he went ahead with iraq 

563.88 566.84 B: that's another topic [laughter] 

565.51 567.59 A: yeah on itself 

567.20 569.44 B: yeah anyway 

568.43 582.87 A: who knows who knows what hit they're really doing even though you can see them live and and here again even the the um the media's interpreting things the way they want to see it or want you to see it versus what maybe is really actually happening 

571.09 572.23 B: i know 

579.79 580.75 B: right 

582.85 591.64 B: mhm well i think the media has to have a limit in what they can report during time of war 'cause it can be dangerous to report too much 

583.49 584.47 A: um 

591.19 592.54 A: this is true 

591.83 599.89 B: and we have a a problem with that with we report too much you know like and with afghanistan and with iraq
