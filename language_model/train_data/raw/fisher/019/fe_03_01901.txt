98.07 99.43 B: um 

99.85 105.93 B: we like to we like to go like get pictures made together and that's a big deal to us you know having 

103.94 104.95 A: oh 

105.16 118.44 A: see we've never done that but um i think the last time we had like a big family picture together was when i was like one 'cause i it you know i'm in the picture in my mom's arms and that's you know i think that's the last time that we did that so 

111.86 114.25 B: [laughter] 

118.66 119.76 A: um 

119.91 124.00 B: so probably just like um just being together and um 

124.58 136.37 B: having you know i think just being able to um 'cause i like i have a sister that lives kind of far away but um we still stay connected you know calling each other and and um 

135.32 139.30 A: yeah yeah same here i mean actually in terms of 

136.38 137.22 B: just 

137.33 140.14 B: kind of keeping up with family stuff no 

139.48 150.70 A: oh sorry to cut you off [laughter] um yeah and i mean in terms of my immediate family i have an older sister and a younger brother and my sister and i are really close i mean i'm i'm close to my brother also 

140.63 142.12 B: (( that's okay go ahead uh-huh )) 

150.71 153.46 A: but you know my sister and i are just 

153.71 162.35 A: you know we talk to each other about everything and mm when she was away at college um you know she was far away and we'd we would keep in touch and 

162.02 175.53 B: just like the connection thing you know i think that's a lot of it is just because i think even um family can extend out of you know can extend like you said you can have extended family or extended whatever as long as you have the connection of 

163.34 164.50 A: (( yeah )) 

173.95 174.97 A: yeah 

175.65 179.13 B: you know the things you have in common and you know 

178.78 180.32 A: yeah exactly 

179.17 181.25 B: the love for things and that sort of thing 

180.99 184.47 A: mhm exactly and i i think also um 

185.46 195.42 A: i don't know if you would agree but kind of going on that definition that there are certain friends that after a while you know basically become like family yeah 

193.53 196.45 B: basically family yes exactly 

195.58 200.62 A: and you know you can even be closer to them i mean i have a few friends that i've been friends with since 

200.85 210.50 A: my junior high days that you know i think we're are closer to me than some of my cousins you know even though i still love my cousins dearly and like you know they're blood but 

202.61 203.58 B: right 

206.61 207.63 B: right 

208.49 211.41 B: exactly but you have more of a connection with 

210.81 212.16 A: mhm 

211.51 214.66 B: them or more of a commonness than you know 

213.84 215.22 A: yeah 

214.70 227.01 B: not that not that you don't with your family but i know it's kind of the same um i kind of have it too with some some friends and i mean i'm very close to um family and that sort of thing and um 

216.81 217.88 A: yeah 

220.03 221.18 A: yeah 

226.98 231.18 B: you know they have cousins and we have lots of cousins and that kind of thing but um 

231.29 233.29 B: i think a lot of it is just having 

233.69 238.66 B: you know it it is the time spent or the time that you spend at it you 

238.00 240.17 A: right exactly yeah that's true 

238.90 242.27 B: know what you what you build or whatever so 

241.17 248.51 A: yeah and i think you start to also just realize more what that means as you grow older i think when i was younger i was definitely like 

246.11 247.25 B: yeah 

248.61 255.10 A: oh i don't need my family you know when i'm independent that's it you don't i'm not dealing with them 

250.75 253.73 B: right [laughter] 

253.78 258.63 B: and i think as you get older you do realize that you need that you know you need that too 

256.64 257.74 A: yeah 

258.23 259.72 A: yeah and even 

259.03 260.86 B: and you appreciate it 

260.23 262.78 A: (( yeah definitely definitely )) 

261.75 265.65 B: so that's kind of a um being able to 

265.88 280.42 B: i don't know that's my big thing is i i love being able to get together and um just hang out and chat and you know see how they're doing and that kind of thing you know just calling and checking up on each other and i mean that's um 

270.40 271.24 A: mhm 

276.48 277.50 A: yeah 

280.45 286.61 B: that's a lot of it but like you said you can do that even with friends and you know extended extended family so 

285.96 296.58 A: yeah yeah exactly and i mean i definitely in terms of extended family like i have some cousins that i'm much closer to than others and you know so who i want to 

296.86 310.21 A: kind of keep in touch with more like recently one of my really close cousins has like um got engaged and that was just you know for you know it was like oh yay you know whereas with another cousin like i might have just gone like oh that's that's great you know but 

303.42 305.14 B: oh that's neat 

305.59 306.98 B: yeah 

308.37 312.14 B: yeah yeah somebody you could be happy with and 

310.28 312.77 A: but but yeah 

312.18 323.20 B: i i think a lot of it too you know i mean 'cause you go through so much together it's like you know happy sad you know whatever types of occasions basically you're you know that's 

323.26 326.86 B: if who you are involved with is you know they're family you know 

326.41 327.72 A: mhm 

327.01 328.73 B: so you have 

329.04 332.26 B: good times and bad times and um 

330.47 331.86 A: yeah 

332.39 333.65 B: so that's a 

334.36 337.53 B: i think it's just a lot of building building blocks 

337.13 341.06 A: yeah definitely i don't know but what what do you think of i mean 

338.01 339.08 B: you know 

341.11 348.00 A: would you go to like any extent for your family i know i have like for me i have some family that um 

348.72 360.43 A: they said like oh no matter what we're family and i'll do anything for you and go to any extent and i kinda think that's a little overboard i mean you know it depends on the situation i would 

353.27 354.61 B: right 

359.42 371.06 B: yeah yeah [laughter] i think i think i'm that because the majority of the time yes i mean if it's not i mean if it wouldn't obviously you know get me thrown in jail or something [laughter] you know what i mean [laughter] mhm but yeah i mean 

367.11 369.87 A: yeah exactly yeah exactly 

370.88 378.39 B: um for the most part you know because i think you do have that that connection or closeness or whatever there so 

378.14 379.25 A: yeah 

378.68 379.60 B: um 

379.90 380.91 B: (( but ah )) 

381.21 388.01 B: so do you all like do does does your family like do holidays and stuff you know get together once once a week or 

381.38 382.03 A: (( um )) 

387.34 398.30 A: um well yeah we tend to we tend to get together once a week actually i thought of something else that like we all love to do together we all you know watch movies together we're a big movie family you know 

388.47 389.83 B: once a month 

397.23 398.61 B: that's cool 

398.38 406.14 A: um when we were younger we used to go out to the movie theatre now we're just kind of like oh go down the street and rent a video pop it in 

404.81 407.44 B: right [laughter] 

406.08 415.82 A: and yeah and then we usually will do that um like at my grandmother's house you know because she's kind of the matriarch you know um 

415.03 416.72 B: that's neat though 

415.99 421.30 A: yeah so and yeah so and tends to be like all my 

421.62 430.20 A: yeah all the family kind of gets together like once a week i mean it's not always once a week we try to do it like once a week but not necessarily you know so 

427.44 429.02 B: yeah try to 

429.64 436.76 B: yeah we like to have family game nights and play get together and play games and and um 

431.81 433.31 A: mhm 

433.88 434.88 A: oh 

436.82 440.79 B: like everybody makes something and brings and you know get together and 

440.23 441.78 A: mhm 

440.80 443.73 B: and just hang out and um 

444.95 446.34 B: i don't know i guess 

446.61 447.50 B: you know 

447.62 450.23 A: yeah that soun- sounds like fun 

448.48 450.03 B: just 

450.01 454.33 B: connections [laughter] make it just trying to make connections with everybody so 

450.77 452.69 A: (( yeah )) 

453.42 454.77 A: yeah 

454.16 466.32 B: i think everybody kind of gets busy sometimes and when you're a member of that you know you need to be you need to you need to stay with your family or at least to be able to get with your family and hang out and that kind of thing because um you know 

466.21 471.64 B: you're not you don't know when something might happen to one of 'em so and that's kind of a big deal in our family so 

468.37 470.08 A: mhm yeah 

471.35 475.88 A: no i think it's the it's the same for our for my family i think um 

476.69 483.95 A: like my my grandfather um died about four years ago now and um 

485.06 495.10 A: like all the daughters like my mom it's my mom's father so my mom and her sister they were all really close to him and i think after that they kind of all that's kind of one i mean they would still visit him 

495.20 503.18 A: fairly frequently but i think after that one because they wanted to take you know take care of my grandmother and two because they kind of 

500.87 501.88 B: right 

503.20 506.37 A: kind of brought them back and made them realize you know 

504.39 508.17 B: kind of brings yeah yeah the realization that yeah 

507.22 509.07 A: yeah so 

508.69 518.51 B: yeah i think it's kinda it's kinda sad in a way ev- even though i see what you mean but it's kind of sad in a way when something like that brings you back to even though i think it's a good thing you know what i mean 

513.05 514.08 A: mhm 

517.52 520.68 A: yeah yeah i know i totally agree and 

518.89 519.66 B: but 

520.20 528.90 B: sometimes i think it takes something to get you know to kind of wake you up and ah no it's the same in our family kinda wake you up and spend time together and you know 

525.23 527.17 A: yeah no no 

528.96 530.51 A: yeah no it's it's 

531.31 540.91 A: definitely kind of like a contradiction because i mean it's not that before that you know we weren't tight knit and we didn't see each other it was just kind of like not as intense and now it's like oh 

535.89 537.12 B: exactly 

539.81 541.89 B: probably more haphazard than 

541.64 542.84 A: yeah 

542.22 555.25 B: and then i i well i know it's like that in our family i mean there's been times where you know you just i think you get to where you take it for granted sometimes and then when something happens sometimes you realize oh my goodness you know this is you know 

545.15 546.11 A: mhm 

549.55 550.58 A: yeah 

552.89 554.49 A: right exactly 

555.56 563.81 B: this isn't always going to be like this you know and it's a ever changing i don't know about your life but you know our family life is a ever changing thing 

557.76 558.76 A: yeah 

563.38 569.05 A: oh yeah definitely with ours yeah and just like i said with so many um 

563.83 566.08 B: so yeah [laughter] 

568.99 581.54 A: people in the extended family it's always like someone's growing up someone just had a baby someone you know is going off to college and we won't see them again so yeah yeah so 

570.75 571.56 B: (( yes )) 

574.53 575.94 B: right 

576.48 583.02 B: college and marriage and yeah i know it's just it's so amazing 

582.58 584.63 A: mhm yeah 

583.60 590.17 B: just to watch the family you know the whole way things change and um 

590.93 592.61 B: that's that really is 

592.48 598.58 A: yeah yeah it is pretty it's pretty amazing and i mean there are definitely times where 

592.62 593.91 B: truly amazing 

599.43 599.89 A: (( you know ))
