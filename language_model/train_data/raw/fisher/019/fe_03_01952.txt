0.26 1.91 B: my name's bob 

1.91 4.24 A: (( hi bob jay how you doing )) 

3.38 5.62 B: jay oh good how are you 

6.30 7.39 A: terrific 

7.15 11.99 B: good so we're supposed to talk about what the word family means to us 

11.59 13.33 A: yeah what's it mean to you 

13.00 17.15 B: well i'd say it basically means my 

17.43 18.48 B: group of 

18.71 28.21 B: group of people that i'm related to that i live with and and that we pull together and ah we 

28.99 31.19 B: love one another basically 

30.96 32.60 A: sounds about right 

31.87 34.29 B: so how does it what does it mean to you 

34.40 36.97 A: ah family to me is ah 

37.35 39.73 A: i grew up in an italian 

40.01 46.26 A: religious family so it was you know lots of people together every sunday 

41.25 42.22 B: oh 

47.74 57.53 A: some of those people are related to you a lot of them were but some of them were just there every week you could depend on them count on them ask them for favors 

58.31 60.98 A: you know they cared about what happened to you 

61.57 63.85 A: you cared about what happened to them 

63.49 65.21 B: yeah that makes sense 

64.00 69.90 A: and that that was and they didn't necessarily have to be related to me but most of my family was 

70.23 72.98 A: but now that i'm older moved on in life 

73.05 77.37 A: my family lives in other parts of the country and i don't get to see them as i did when i was a child 

77.59 79.00 A: to me ah 

79.16 80.98 A: they're still my family 

80.99 82.02 A: (( but ah )) 

82.36 86.00 A: i've also come up with that that family circle of friends 

85.94 87.25 B: oh okay 

86.56 90.77 A: and i consider those people family too like friends that at 

91.16 100.11 A: the drop of the dime five o'clock in the morning they were needed to go to the hospital or were in a car accident or stranded that i would just drop what i was doing and go get them 

100.34 106.66 A: and i feel that those people feel the same way about me it's a selected few but i consider those people family too 

107.37 117.06 B: yeah i agree i've got some friends that ah i would well different ones throughout my life i've considered family just because they're the ones i could depend on 

117.15 125.81 B: ah the people that ah you know i cared about and really wanted to make sure everything went well for them that kind of thing 

125.19 129.63 A: absolutely or like the like a friend of my mom's i always called her aunt sheila 

129.29 130.30 B: uh-huh 

129.71 132.41 A: she wasn't my aunt [laughter] you know what i mean 

131.05 133.07 B: yeah [laughter] yeah 

132.42 140.62 A: but like she went to all the weddings she knew my grandparents you know like everybody knew my aunt sheila my other cousins called her aunt sheila 

140.82 142.40 A: (( she's just aunt sheila )) 

142.10 143.01 B: uh-huh 

142.53 146.76 A: couldn't tell you her last name 'cause she was aunt sheila we weren't even related 

145.11 152.29 B: yeah she was just aunt sheila that makes sense now i under ah you know the stereotype of 

147.09 148.24 A: yeah 

152.74 162.28 B: italian families is is a pretty close knit family with lots of people coming over for dinner every week is that kinda how it was for you 

161.39 169.11 A: yeah well those those stereotypes they're based on a lot of truth [laughter] you know i don't care what stereotype it is 

165.81 166.85 B: uh-huh 

169.12 170.77 A: or who you're referring to 

171.00 174.74 A: like that stereotype was probably started by italian people 

174.33 175.70 B: i would guess 

175.00 179.51 A: [laughter] and then you know they let the secret out and everybody else found out so 

178.80 180.12 B: yeah 

180.39 182.49 A: yeah that's about right um 

182.59 188.79 A: it's a shame because i probably saw the tail end of it being older i'm in my mid thirties 

188.46 189.41 B: uh-huh 

189.01 191.77 A: but like my little sister didn't get to see it as much 

192.30 193.99 A: as like my older 

192.47 193.44 B: oh really 

194.47 198.02 A: family and the cousins and everybody because 

198.42 201.52 A: right towards i don't know i guess when i was nine or ten 

202.03 212.02 A: if one of your grandparents passed away usually it didn't make a difference but my grandparents got remarried and like in our family that was really like 

208.68 209.57 B: uh-huh 

212.98 214.61 A: kind of just i don't know 

215.06 216.81 A: made everything different 

216.32 217.84 B: oh huh 

217.10 218.10 A: so 

219.55 227.13 A: and again my mom grew up with many brothers sisters cousins my grandparents grew up with 

227.15 232.41 A: you know one of six one of seven you know what i mean and now i'm like one of three 

230.05 231.06 B: wow 

233.53 240.17 A: i'll probably have one kid you know what i mean like so that large family thing's also people can't afford to have twelve kids anymore 

235.55 236.83 B: people are having less 

239.91 241.64 B: well yeah that's true 

241.32 244.23 A: so that that's definitely curtailed to it plus 

244.37 245.29 A: (( like )) 

246.28 250.18 A: my aunt she's in her nineties she said look jay she goes 

250.39 262.38 A: you know when we lived in italy we came to america there was a lot of problems in the world then there was you know depression the plague [laughter] you know like you still had all kinds of things 

259.18 260.15 B: uh-huh 

262.65 267.34 A: almost every single family that we knew almost all of our 

267.54 269.99 A: aunts and uncles they had all lost a child 

270.43 275.29 A: problems at birth plague pneumonia smallpox whatever 

275.36 276.34 B: uh-huh 

275.72 277.48 A: people you know the 

277.71 282.55 A: fatality rate when they were young people you know hey look we gotta have three kids 

282.46 283.79 B: well that's true 

283.90 285.86 A: we may only wind up with one 

286.51 287.85 A: gotta have three 

286.52 288.13 B: yeah that's true 

288.18 293.24 A: gotta have three and that's that's you know i guess the beauty of modern technology but 

293.01 295.96 B: so do you have one now or you're planning on it 

294.94 300.19 A: no i just i plan on one kid maybe two but because ah 

297.29 298.17 B: (( oh )) 

301.11 304.97 A: i just know my age i'm a realist ah 

305.02 305.94 A: i 

306.07 311.73 A: want to be able to play if i have a boy you know softball throw him to teach a curve whatever 

311.33 312.37 B: uh-huh 

311.76 312.84 A: hockey 

313.05 317.77 A: and i feel that you know third or fourth child down the road i'd be too old to enjoy it 

317.82 319.13 B: that makes sense 

318.15 328.52 A: and i feel that i'm cheating my child if i do that just like when i was younger i wasn't financially secure enough to put myself in a position to have a kid i wouldn't put a child through that 

320.99 322.25 B: that makes sense 

328.42 332.95 B: uh-huh yeah well i had right now i've got four kids 

332.71 335.54 A: that's terrific congratulations god bless you man 

333.99 334.96 B: so 

335.19 336.83 B: i like them so 

336.98 340.86 B: you know but i started that thirteen years ago so 

340.17 341.86 A: right so you're older like me 

341.58 345.41 B: yeah i'm i'm in my mid thirties as well so 

344.99 347.01 A: right when did how old's your oldest 

346.50 347.84 B: ah he's twelve 

347.74 350.98 A: all right so you had a kid when you were like in your early twenties 

350.67 354.82 B: yeah i was what probably twenty four something like that 

352.33 358.34 A: were you financially ready when that happened to you or just you would rather have the kid than worry about the money right 

354.96 356.27 B: no but 

357.63 362.61 B: yeah that and i also had family around my you know my 

361.44 362.88 A: support system 

362.65 366.42 B: yeah and they they helped us out and you know 

365.12 367.61 A: that's terrific you need that because to do it alone 

367.75 371.77 A: like i know people i have friends they're divorced at like twenty five with a kid 

371.49 372.44 B: uh-huh 

372.18 375.02 A: somebody's left paying the bills you know what i mean 

373.92 386.24 B: yeah that's that's not good and ah part of the thing about family and marriage is having a commitment you know and there's there's a lot of people that you know they say well it's not working out 

380.79 381.80 A: i agree 

384.94 387.21 A: we got an escape clause here 

386.55 388.37 B: yeah you know let's let's 

387.26 389.09 A: they leave themselves the escape clause 

388.58 391.07 B: do the divorce thing and that's 

391.28 398.15 B: that's just sometimes it shouldn't be an option unless there's some sort of an emergency or something and 

397.86 402.71 A: i agree like that's it was a big issue when my grandfather after my grandmother passed away 

403.44 405.66 A: just remarrying was like an issue 

405.28 406.38 B: oh really 

405.77 407.21 A: in our family 

407.63 411.02 A: ah yeah that was that was pretty much the big issue and you 

411.56 418.21 A: know it caused like a like the big sunday gatherings at my grandmother's house well she was gone and my grandfather wasn't having them with his new wife 

418.13 419.03 B: oh 

418.41 422.66 A: nor were people like there's so many other people we wanted to see on a sunday then 

423.26 425.94 A: not our grandmother you know what i mean so 

424.81 425.81 B: yeah 

426.34 427.62 B: yeah 

426.96 434.12 A: it was definitely ah i i mean and and that wasn't a divorce case scenario it was just after the facts 

431.90 433.24 B: yeah 

434.43 437.55 A: i definitely agree a lot of my friends 

437.77 445.93 A: everybody got married when i was twenty four twenty five everybody i hung out with and and it sucked for me 'cause you stopped talking to those people they go about and have their 

440.29 441.14 B: uh-huh 

445.97 460.22 A: you know they don't have time to hang out and just you know whatever go watch the game every single night or whatever so you lose contact with those people but then you run into them again five years later like oh what's up oh not in this i remember you had your daughter whatever you had another kid on the way 

446.52 448.11 B: their own lives and all 

450.92 451.83 B: yeah 

460.02 463.89 A: how's everything going got any more kids no i got divorced last summer 

463.71 464.71 B: oh 

464.01 467.86 A: oh that's nice what about your kids well i get them every third day 

467.79 468.92 B: oh boy 

468.14 480.07 A: would you really want that like i want my kids i want to know they're in the next room [laughter] you know what i mean we get divorced you're buying the house next to me that's the only option i'm leaving 

469.85 470.94 B: yeah 

472.92 475.46 B: yeah want them every day 

477.35 481.98 B: yep [laughter] yeah 

481.00 485.41 A: like i don't want to joke around with kids that's why i haven't had them yet i wanted to be 

484.24 485.26 B: yeah 

485.89 487.20 B: that makes sense 

485.93 487.53 A: family exactly 

487.38 489.80 B: did you have you gotten married 

490.03 490.84 A: no

510.26 512.46 B: well yeah yeah so

525.82 527.07 B: yeah 

526.64 531.26 A: and that's i mean i don't why sell yourself short settle for less 

531.67 536.31 A: let me try this maybe it's the right one but if it's not i got an escape clause 

535.73 538.87 B: yeah i i don't go for that so much
