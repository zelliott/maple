15.57 18.86 B: oh okay i'm actually in um georgia 

18.80 21.85 A: oh so we're both southerners 

21.13 22.21 B: right 

22.11 24.30 A: [laughter] 

23.19 26.09 B: so what do you think about ah the question 

26.59 29.83 A: well i yeah i'm not really i'm 

29.96 31.91 A: not really sure 

32.04 32.88 A: ah 

32.97 40.03 A: as far as that corporate what corporate ethics i believe that's what what i'm understanding that they're wanting us to talk about 

39.75 41.11 B: right 

40.59 43.34 A: ah and how it has affected us um 

44.08 53.02 A: i'm really you know not that although i work i'm not that directly involved with with corporates um 

53.65 59.50 A: with any changes of of of corporate ethics and and i'm kind of um 

59.82 67.39 A: personally kind of agreeing with the way my company has been working i haven't seen any changes what about you 

67.56 73.86 B: well i i think they mean not only just the company that you work for but 

73.87 79.63 B: just in the overall in the environment the corporate environment within the united states 

76.95 79.04 A: mhm 

79.76 94.37 B: you know um in light of all the things that have happened recently with enron with m._c._i. martha stewart and some other people who have been involved in some major corporate scandals i personally think that 

79.86 81.24 A: mhm 

83.63 85.32 A: mhm 

89.23 89.98 A: right 

94.79 98.76 B: you know these people should be prosecuted i believe that 

99.01 110.35 B: they should be ah put in jail i think they key should be thrown away and i have very little tolerance for people who already have a lot of money 

101.94 103.58 A: yeah 

110.64 111.82 A: mhm 

110.71 125.61 B: and they're clamoring constantly to get more you know we're talking about people who have millions of dollars already we're not talking about people who are struggling trying to pay the bills to keep the lights on or you know trying to ah these people 

120.03 122.07 A: oh definitely not 

125.72 133.51 B: struggling to maybe to try to stay in their million dollar homes or something like that or and they're not even struggling to do that but 

133.57 135.75 B: you know to me it's just totally different 

136.47 149.60 B: than if you had a situation where maybe say you had a a sick child and you really needed some money to pay for his operation to keep the child alive you know to me that would be not to say that it would be right to steal 

149.86 151.02 A: mhm 

150.18 152.88 B: but i could understand that a little bit better 

153.07 162.94 B: you know but i just have very little tolerance for it and i think that it's unfortunate that the people who have the least are the ones who are penalized the most 

163.25 165.46 B: for doing crimes that are 

165.68 168.88 B: much less serious in my mind 

168.56 176.25 A: well and and i mean you're absolutely right however i'm i'm not sure and and i think that what's happening you know it's 

176.21 191.20 A: even here most recently with american airlines um i i think that it's good and i think it's going to affect change but i don't know that it's going to to filter down to the should i say the little person 

191.22 192.20 A: um 

192.59 200.44 A: until several years i think all this has to settle but i don't know that any any of any of the current 

200.57 205.66 A: um happenings the news happenings have have 

205.67 208.99 A: elicited any change as far as 

209.03 211.66 A: pay being distributed to other people 

211.96 219.05 A: within a company you know maybe ah corporations who are involved in this that haven't gotten should i say caught 

219.06 224.85 A: um are maybe looking at redistributing it but i wonder when that's gonna happen 

225.90 228.16 B: yeah that's a good question 

228.29 236.05 B: and and one of the other things that that i've seen and i think a lot of people have seen as well i've certainly seen it in the media 

235.99 247.44 B: is every time i i look at the newspaper or look at on the internet or watch t._v. i hear something about corporate executives getting these huge bonuses 

247.77 250.12 B: you know ah [laughter] you know 

247.79 249.35 A: right right 

250.22 258.75 B: i think the money should be more perhaps more evenly distributed to the employees and they should share in the profits as well if 

250.38 251.48 A: well yeah 

257.13 258.66 A: oh definitely 

258.82 261.85 A: and and what's what's mind blowing is 

261.89 268.85 A: is how these these corporate executives are are um protected even if they are 

269.02 277.10 A: fired let go or they're i mean they millions of dollars they're they're protected and yeah i agree 

275.80 277.10 B: (( they go and )) 

277.20 285.70 B: yeah if if they can somebody can go and serve as seat president and c._e._o. of a major corporation for two years 

285.76 289.45 B: and in order to get rid of him or her as the case may be 

285.80 286.74 A: mhm 

288.24 290.35 A: right uh-huh 

289.52 297.26 B: you've gotta pay them usually they even have a contract or some type of agreement where you you pay them dearly 

297.21 298.26 A: mhm 

297.28 307.40 B: to let them go i mean somebody i think the other day i was reading that some there were some executives who receive these huge what they were talking about just the 

307.73 310.63 B: (( severance packages that c._e._o.s receive )) 

308.93 311.97 A: mhm mhm mhm 

310.72 324.14 B: when they're released from corporations and you think about that in comparison with the other people with people like i'm assuming you and me you know who who maybe working for a corporation if they let us go they might give you 

319.47 320.31 A: uh-huh 

323.96 325.53 A: [laughter] i know 

324.33 325.99 B: three months' salary 

325.60 329.71 A: [laughter] i know they might give us notice that we're 

326.47 327.97 B: (( you know [laughter] )) 

329.81 333.82 A: that we're we're gonna be gone yeah instead of just locking us out 

330.25 331.34 B: yeah and 

331.57 333.32 B: (( and and just in and they don't )) 

333.47 341.13 B: yeah and you don't even know that you're gonna be let go until you know people show up for work you know i have a friend that works for coca-cola and 

335.99 337.57 A: mhm 

341.34 351.94 B: he showed up for work now he wasn't laid off but he was telling me that he showed up for work and you know the announced that there were going to be five hundred additional jobs that were gonna be reduced or seminated 

350.36 351.31 A: (( uh-huh )) 

351.97 360.22 B: and he showed up for work one day and um they called everybody and he said all of his the people in the department where he works 

360.31 361.86 B: and either the people 

362.10 376.92 B: ah remained on with coca-cola or were given raises i mean or were let go right there on the spot and they were told to go and clean out their desk and they were dismissed and they got you know maybe a couple of months' severance pay 

367.36 368.47 A: mhm 

368.85 369.80 A: mhm 

371.31 372.26 A: right 

377.00 381.28 B: um you know just a very basic severance package 

377.19 378.17 A: mhm 

381.01 383.75 A: yeah they didn't get their they didn't get 

383.76 396.85 A: half of the company and two million dollars to boot [laughter] but see and that's so that kind of brings me back to my original point so so these executives are are caught 

385.67 387.09 B: (( right )) 

387.14 389.51 B: (( and and two or three bentleys )) 

396.67 406.37 A: but how you know i don't say see these companies going well okay you know we need to reexamine this and let's kinda distribute this you know 

406.23 413.27 A: i don't see that it's going to that it's eliciting any changes so as far as as corporate ethics 

413.62 419.66 A: other than getting caught have have they changed any are they going to change any you know 

419.87 420.78 A: i don't know 

420.12 425.03 B: yeah that's i mean that that's a question that remains to be answered 

424.97 428.80 A: yeah and and is is is that 

428.94 434.15 A: is that even well yeah it should be an issue i mean it yes it should be an issue 

434.19 435.51 A: (( and ah )) 

434.56 435.58 B: oh yeah 

435.61 436.63 A: um 

436.93 450.00 A: however you know as far as our corporation is concerned ah it is well published what the president gets i mean it's in the annual port report what he gets what is severance package is gonna get 

450.11 455.92 A: so why aren't why aren't people like you and i saying hey wait a minute 

456.01 456.85 A: (( you )) 

457.69 463.71 A: know now texas is not a union state you know maybe unions are something that need to 

464.06 464.95 A: (( i don't know )) 

464.33 465.75 B: resurface 

465.46 473.18 A: maybe resurface to get i mean unfortunately maybe to improve the the ethics of of the ivory tower 

473.79 475.29 A: i would hate that 

474.42 486.37 B: [laughter] i think that's a good point i i think that may be one of the solutions to the problem you know only thing is if if generally if you're working and if you're in management 

486.48 487.86 B: typically 

488.18 490.70 B: it's very difficult to organize 

490.30 490.86 A: (( mm )) 

491.01 495.63 B: a union i mean there are no unions in management i mean you 

492.43 493.64 A: oh yeah 

496.63 498.76 B: you're just kind of on your own 

498.59 506.00 A: well i think kinda that's the point though yeah i mean the management it's the underlings who formed the union to keep the management 

506.41 510.92 B: well no well what i mean though was the lower management i was speaking of more 

509.87 511.08 A: oh oh 

511.02 521.34 B: you know there are a lot of lower and middle managers who are not really directly involved in those things who are not involved in the scandals like the i'm 

521.48 522.74 B: speaking of 

523.02 528.23 B: the people who are doing all the dirt are generally the people who are upper upper management 

527.61 529.05 A: right uh-huh 

528.90 533.35 B: the right the president and right under him his entourage 

533.11 536.04 A: uh-huh uh-huh his or his her 

534.48 535.21 B: so 

537.91 540.75 A: you were saying his i'm not kinda 

541.02 545.77 A: you know they're not all his i mean they aren't all males there are females so i was just kinda 

545.52 548.65 B: oh yeah that that's true i mean you know 

546.06 547.22 A: [laughter] 

548.66 560.85 B: and that's kind of you know pardon my sexism [laughter] but i mean but the majority of people of of corporate executives in america today still are male and that's why 

551.26 554.03 A: [laughter] 

560.84 563.69 A: yeah yeah i was just kinda jabbing you a little 

561.79 562.56 B: i'm 

562.93 570.35 B: yeah but you know um what i was gonna say though is that i what was the second question it was how can we 

564.15 565.90 A: [laughter] 

570.37 577.52 B: resolve that and one of the ways that you suggested is the unions i think by sending them to jail 

571.86 573.62 A: yeah 

577.54 585.88 B: you know [laughter] by prosecuting ah people who are who are guilty of being involved in corporate scandals 

578.26 579.13 A: [laughter] 

585.60 587.13 A: yeah well you know i 

587.71 599.95 A: that the people who are watching this are learning by example but i'm being total totally naive to think that ah and i'm sure there are some people going gee you know maybe we should rethink
