222.57 230.35 B: and then my husband was um graduate student so that's what took us to florida and um 

230.71 235.54 B: it seemed like the area in florida we came to is like really good for 

235.50 245.04 B: for families you know like they have a lot of parks and a lot of um like now my boys are into baseball so it's really really family orientated 

239.12 240.29 A: yeah 

244.94 259.93 B: where when i moved out on my own and had my family i lived in pennsylvania and it was kinda laid back and and not much to do and um yeah so it really it actually brought us cl- you know everybody closer together than 

250.30 252.61 A: (( okay yeah )) 

260.05 262.81 B: than anything which is cool 

261.00 261.93 A: (( that's nice ))

296.28 304.77 B: um yeah pretty much you know my father was a doctor so it was it was really hard because you know when your father's not around that much you don't really 

304.82 312.40 B: you can't get too close um now he's retired and i'm older an- and it seems like the closeness gets brought in 

312.11 313.13 A: i see 

312.53 314.90 B: more and um 

315.48 325.13 B: yeah so it's pretty much yeah we were close i mean sisters and brothers fight all of the time but we're a lot closer now that we're you know we have families of our own
