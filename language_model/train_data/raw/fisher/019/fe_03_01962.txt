1.77 2.93 A: (( hello )) 

2.54 4.47 B: hello my name is don how are you 

4.31 6.07 A: good how are you my name's sue 

5.81 6.56 B: sue 

8.18 11.02 B: so um your opinions on 

11.11 12.09 B: corporate 

12.98 15.26 B: legality at this point of the game right now 

15.97 19.84 A: um i i couldn't understand what they were saying what were what were they saying 

19.69 27.59 B: i i think what she i had a problem with her accent as well um i think what they're looking for is um corporate ethics at this point of the game and how it's affected us 

28.99 32.12 A: you mean like as far as enron and those scandals and stuff 

31.33 37.11 B: those scandals i would also probably assume like right now the big thing in the news would be um 

37.02 46.46 B: american airlines their employees are asked to be you know take all these concessions to keep them out of bankruptcy while they're giving away perks by the billions to their 

41.26 42.61 A: right take take 

44.98 46.24 A: right right 

46.74 48.63 B: management 

48.03 53.35 A: right well i think that people like in enron and people like 

53.46 57.19 A: the c._e._o. at american airlines i think they should all be 

57.61 63.99 A: be held criminally responsible really because it is criminal acts that they're doing and they're cheating their own people while they're 

64.06 66.16 A: putting money in their own pockets 

66.03 71.73 B: well from my from my region right here um u._s. airways is the number one employers 

71.71 84.23 B: and i'm i'm watching u._s. airways as they begged with the county and they begged with the city to give them all these concessions to get them through bankruptcy court and then they get right out of bankruptcy court and then they're going to end their leases and just terminate us 

71.84 72.69 A: mhm 

84.85 95.89 B: you know and then cost this region billions i find that that action appalling and i think the government should just start going after these these people that's ridiculous to go that far and 

87.57 88.96 A: right right 

95.20 101.98 A: no i don't think they're doing enough to i don't think that they're making any statements about it and that's why people keep doing it and getting away with it 

101.64 107.32 B: you know and i mean the effect it has to be having on the economy i mean enron definitely tanked the stock market 

106.80 112.81 A: oh definitely [laughter] that affected all of us i mean not just i mean the people that worked there 

108.21 109.28 B: (( i )) 

112.86 121.89 A: um i have a little bit of an issue with people that worked there putting all their eggs into enron you know they say that i've always been advised never to 

122.06 122.94 A: to put 

123.19 127.62 A: you know everything into one company especially a company that you work for 

127.74 134.66 A: so you know some of those people i have i feel really bad for those people that had all their money in enron 

134.80 143.13 A: but i on the other hand i don't think that they should have had it all in enron but they believed in the company and the company gave them reason to believe in them so you know 

139.36 140.99 B: mean yeah they believed they believed 

142.34 148.21 B: and you know if you work for them i would think that you should believe in the people that you work for but that's that's 

148.14 149.12 A: right 

148.60 149.65 B: tragic 

149.36 157.62 A: right i mean nobody could have anticipated anything like that happening i mean in a big company like that you would never think that it could just go just like that you know 

157.82 159.81 A: same with the airlines i mean 

159.90 162.26 A: well the airlines are a little bit different because 

162.64 164.49 A: they've suffered so much 

163.34 168.78 B: yeah nine one one did do a little bit of harm to them but i think the airlines had this coming a long time before 

168.19 171.15 A: yeah me too yeah yeah they've been ah 

170.09 170.82 B: (( hand )) 

172.43 175.75 A: they kinda have a monopoly the big airlines you know there's 

176.74 183.36 A: you know there's only so many airlines to choose from and they work in conjunction with one another one lowers their fares the other one does 

182.06 187.12 B: true but you you just can't i mean even u._s. air before their bankruptcy they they were still paying um 

186.89 199.02 B: ah michael wolfe their chairman a huge amount for his retirement and severance pay and this that whatever knowing darn well that coming down the line that they've just been you know fudging on their accounting systems to you know hold theirselves through 

198.98 200.29 A: right right 

200.70 205.08 A: yeah i mean and you know they've got to change some laws too like ah 

205.53 207.35 A: you know some of those enron people 

207.36 218.36 A: enron people had mansions being built in i think florida it was and there's no law that that they can have that you know there's no law that can take that away from them you know 

217.52 220.80 B: yeah i don't i don't begrudge anybody making money i don't 

220.24 221.52 A: oh i don't either 

222.09 236.02 A: i mean if you earn your money and you you're entitled to bonuses i think you should get them and i don't have anything against people becoming rich in corporate america because that that's the goal but to cheat other people on the way up there 

236.04 236.90 A: (( you know )) 

236.51 241.61 B: yeah and and there definitely should be some kind of a you know response from the government on this 

237.10 237.84 A: i 

241.64 242.87 A: yeah yeah 

242.34 244.53 B: more so than what they're doing i would believe 

244.25 247.39 A: right right because they're really not doing anything 

247.31 254.78 B: i mean every time you hear someone who gets investigated now on wall street basically they just get them for obstruction being the lesser charge 

247.69 248.54 A: i mean 

255.52 256.42 B: you know 

255.93 257.69 A: (( right )) 

257.26 258.99 B: well that's nothing 

258.35 261.70 A: the ordinary people like you or i if we went out and ah 

262.00 267.96 A: robbed a house or something it we'd probably be thrown in jail for longer than these guys are thrown in jail for you know 

267.57 272.15 B: yeah white collar crime is much nicer than [laughter] 

270.71 271.64 A: yeah 

271.66 277.10 A: yeah and they have they have the money to fight it they get the best lawyers they have the money to do it and 

277.11 278.82 A: you know let's face it if 

278.87 281.74 A: you have the money you can get out of it [laughter] 

281.37 282.68 B: yes you can 

282.47 285.22 A: 'cause you can buy you can buy people to get you out of it 

285.50 295.40 A: and you know then maybe they end up spending a little bit of time in federal prison which is more like a hotel room you know what i mean [laughter] some of those federal prisons are 

295.42 296.27 A: (( you know )) 

296.33 303.55 A: they say if you're gonna do a crime you might as well do a federal crime because the federal prison system is a lot better than you know regular jail [laughter] 

303.94 312.32 B: i i've never realized exactly what those people at enron were going through i mean not necessarily enron but the people in houston were going through because of the loss of enron 

312.43 317.75 B: until you know hear in allegany county western pennsylvania we were going through we are going through 

317.76 318.99 A: right 

318.25 323.83 B: you know this u._s. air mess and i mean they have laid off over forty per cent of their workers here in pittsburgh they've 

323.92 326.93 B: um it it's just become you know 

327.27 339.53 B: insurmountable at this point of the game that if county doesn't just beg and borrow to to do everything they can to keep them they're just going to walk away and just care nothing even though like three months ago we were the number one supporters of them to get them through bankruptcy 

339.38 340.68 A: right right 

340.27 343.28 B: you know so i i see what what corporate greed and um 

344.29 348.63 B: you know their actions can do 'cause they really don't care about us [laughter] they've made that clear 

348.02 351.12 A: no when it comes right down to it they really don't i mean 

350.10 357.95 B: no they they don't care about this county and you know this county has made them the number one employer in the county and now they're just cutting back and they they're ready to walk out on us 

357.98 359.29 A: yep 

359.54 365.60 B: and leaving the rest of us county payers with i believe six hundred and some million dollars worth of debt on that airport we did for them 

365.04 365.95 A: yep 

366.66 373.09 A: yeah and my husband works for a company that just recently came out of bankruptcy and you know and 

373.64 376.31 A: luckily they came out of it i mean a 

376.70 381.04 A: lot of companies never do you know unless unless they get help from the government 

381.28 382.71 A: (( you know i mean )) 

382.74 387.80 A: i don't understand the priorities [noise] the government puts on bailing people out of certain things you 

387.99 388.78 A: know 

389.06 392.40 A: i could see them wanting to bail the airlines out to a point 

392.74 395.91 A: they they kinda have to you have to have the air traffic 

395.49 396.98 B: yeah i mean 

396.25 398.28 A: you know but um 

398.88 400.02 A: i don't 

399.72 405.02 B: and that opens up a whole new can of worms then because everybody's going to pretty much feel that their industry deserves just as much 

405.16 406.25 B: credibility 

405.47 407.86 A: (( know i just right right )) 

408.28 413.06 A: yeah i live in rhode island and we went um we had that terrible nightclub fire here 

412.20 413.78 B: yes the nightclub fire 

413.09 424.35 A: you know and ah they they were turned down any federal help at all just and they were just looking for help to pay the rescue workers the overtime that it cost you know stuff like that 

424.43 429.89 A: and ah they turned them down and they appealed it and they turned it down they just turned it down again yesterday 

430.22 431.38 A: (( you know so you )) 

431.43 439.89 A: know and that that was not a lot of money you know that really would of helped the state a lot that needed it you know [laughter] i mean there was [noise] 

437.63 442.87 B: mhm where the airlines i mean that was billions that they asked for in government guarantees 

442.86 446.38 A: right right [noise] 

443.99 445.85 B: and i mean billions 

447.64 451.96 A: (( i don't know i just don't know whether [noise] could you hold on one second )) 

452.72 454.40 A: hello hello 

454.86 455.78 A: hold on 

456.55 457.94 A: (( i'm sorry )) 

457.38 459.10 B: (( that's all right )) 

458.48 459.23 A: (( jeff )) 

462.72 464.48 A: yeah i don't i don't know what about 

464.84 467.87 A: corporate america i don't know where it's headed i don't know if there's any 

468.03 469.24 A: would be any 

469.70 472.92 A: huge companies left that are that are honest companies 

473.83 484.73 B: you know i think it would probably do a whole lot more for the industry the the consumer confidence and everything if they could actually just prosecute one person and you know see it through to fruition 

485.05 496.46 B: that the american people could actually see like well at least they're trying to do something they got somebody you know you hear about all these people that they take in but then you never hear anything else no put them on court t._v. let's see the whole thing go through [laughter] 

489.30 490.29 A: right 

495.08 495.92 A: (( yeah )) 

496.06 497.57 A: yeah yeah 

497.65 500.96 A: they don't have problems putting the ordinary people on court t._v. 

499.37 505.03 B: yeah i mean it's not like i'm going for a public flogging but i mean you know show us the whole thing let's you know get somebody 

504.89 505.75 A: yep 

506.60 507.42 A: [laughter] 

509.94 511.43 A: so um 

512.15 513.69 A: (( i don't know i guess )) 

515.39 518.76 A: i don't know what you what else to say about corporate america 

519.43 532.86 B: ah well like you said you just had a husband company come out of bankruptcy and ah i've had our largest employer in our area come come out of it and they're still prepared to walk away [laughter] with government guarantees 

532.67 533.81 A: yeah 

534.10 537.01 A: well sometimes it's not enough too you know 

539.21 540.49 B: um 

540.07 544.25 A: sometimes it's just not enough that that it's not going to do it's just not going to 

544.35 549.00 A: it may help like in the short term but in the long term it's gonna end up the same way you know 

550.59 560.22 B: they they've already reduced their services um they're going to be different no matter what that u._s. air that you know up in your area's going to be different [laughter] 

560.59 568.31 A: yeah i mean they're going to have to do something because there's not going to be any airlines left i mean it's only a matter of time before the other ones are going to have to do the same thing 

567.93 572.02 B: well i mean if every airline right now is getting concessions to go into bankruptcy 

572.70 573.74 A: right 

572.75 575.81 B: i mean why would the healthy ones not do it 

575.44 577.45 A: (( right i )) 

578.69 587.69 B: and i and i'm sure a lot a lot of that is a lot of that has to do with some of those union contracts because i mean you know the airlines were getting union contract after union contract every time 

579.03 580.21 A: (( mean i )) 

587.35 588.92 A: right 

587.88 591.24 B: and i mean i'm sure some of them were accepted 

591.36 592.82 A: oh yeah sure 

594.29 599.89 B: so it's not like i can blame management on everything but i i'm a firm believer that if management
