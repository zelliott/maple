321.57 326.14 A: um do you have brothers and sisters that that have family or 

326.13 332.60 B: well they're all in a different state um my two half sisters live in um 

332.72 333.76 B: arizona 

333.87 335.88 B: my half brother lives in new hampshire 

336.33 342.14 B: my husband's um relatives all live here in california and 

342.28 345.33 B: i would consider them my family 

346.51 350.12 B: before i would consider my biological family my family 

349.80 351.41 A: oh okay 

351.13 364.54 B: um my my husband has a brother and a sister and they both have children that are close to the same age as ours um and they're not too far away we can get to anybody's house within about an hour and a half 

364.51 371.64 B: whether it's you know his brother his sister his father or his mother um they're all here in california um 

372.52 381.75 B: and those are the people besides my immediate family that live in this house those are the people that i consider family i've got a cousin here 

372.84 373.61 A: yeah 

381.80 387.97 B: um and a cousin a female cousin here and a female cousin back east in new hampshire 

388.04 397.38 B: that make up the rest of my family i'm very close with those two gals um but but that's it that's it yeah 

392.52 393.37 A: (( oh )) 

395.35 396.24 A: yeah 

396.40 397.81 A: yeah like i said i 

398.60 399.99 A: (( my ah )) 

400.05 401.39 A: my mother had ah 

402.00 403.42 A: (( brothers and sisters )) 

403.23 404.16 B: yeah 

405.27 407.11 A: she's kind of she kind of 

407.32 408.32 A: um 

408.62 410.84 A: i guess they didn't get along 

411.30 412.50 A: so she got 

412.86 416.54 A: she was kind of okay with a couple of them but 

417.09 419.55 A: but ah she hasn't kept in touch 

419.72 420.57 B: mm 

420.49 423.88 A: and my dad's the same way and i mean 

424.13 427.40 A: i don't even know really his side of the family at all so 

429.12 430.42 A: so um 

430.71 433.19 A: yeah that's why for me it's more like 

433.46 439.79 A: i don't really consider my relatives [laughter] like part of my family because they were never really a big part of my life 

439.53 442.66 B: yeah that's just kind of the way you were brought up 

442.39 443.44 A: yeah 

443.18 444.12 B: (( um )) 

444.49 451.41 B: another um thing about my family out here in california my husband and i and the kids 

451.52 462.49 B: were living in arizona and i just had nobody there and he had nobody there and i thought it was really really important for my children to grow up with their cousins 

462.50 463.40 A: (( oh )) 

462.51 468.92 B: because i had cousins when i was growing up the two gals that i mentioned to you and and their brothers 

469.18 470.57 B: and um 

470.60 473.85 B: some of my best memories you know doing some 

474.07 478.04 B: anything with my sister my cousins um 

478.18 485.08 B: you know some of my best memories and just to think that the kids weren't going to have any family to grow up with in arizona 

485.24 486.77 B: made me want to 

486.82 490.37 B: move to california just so that they'd have family to grow up with 

490.31 493.47 A: oh wow so that's mainly why you moved here then 

492.95 495.61 B: yeah yeah it is 

495.65 499.58 B: um just because there was nobody over there nobody and ah 

498.27 499.24 A: yeah 

500.08 501.10 B: um 

502.36 505.35 A: yeah i remember we did i did visit my cousins 

505.60 510.16 A: more often when i was younger i mean they lived at like 

508.27 510.05 B: yeah 

511.08 516.23 A: well we lived in dallas and they lived in san antonio so it's like a five hour drive 

515.63 517.73 B: oh yeah yeah 

516.64 518.90 A: didn't see them too often 

519.11 521.09 A: maybe once a year or something 

520.59 524.92 B: yeah so you don't have a whole lot of memories with your cousins either 

524.86 526.32 A: ah not 

525.94 527.81 B: not a lot 

526.54 529.66 A: too much there's one particular i guess 

529.74 532.98 A: brother that she visited i remember them 

533.26 536.17 A: mostly 'cause she would visit him and we would 

536.27 538.45 A: we were kind of the same age 

538.46 539.61 A: and me and 

539.78 541.46 A: some of my sisters so 

542.59 547.05 A: so um i kind of that's really they're the main ones that i remember 

547.41 549.00 A: so but we really haven't 

549.88 551.72 A: kept in touch or whatever 

551.25 558.48 B: yeah yeah so what do you do now when you have a family gathering it's it's you and your parents and maybe a brother or sister 

552.45 553.32 A: (( yeah )) 

558.68 559.62 B: or 

558.88 559.94 A: um 

560.05 564.33 A: yeah it's my family my sisters and like their boyfriends 

564.75 569.17 A: (( or husbands or whatever so that's family and that's )) 

566.31 567.24 B: yeah 

569.78 575.26 A: ah actually none of my sisters have had kids yet or anything so 

574.58 576.00 B: really yeah 

576.09 577.22 A: (( so um )) 

577.97 581.36 A: and it probably won't happen any time soon [laughter] 

581.08 584.39 B: so you don't have a whole bunch of nieces and nephews running around 

583.97 584.86 A: (( no )) 

584.48 585.43 B: (( no )) 

584.90 586.57 A: [laughter] 

585.69 588.07 B: [laughter] 

587.01 589.55 A: (( and i don't my older sister )) 

589.79 592.23 A: i don't think she even wants kids so 

591.52 592.86 B: yeah 

592.76 593.89 A: but 

594.39 599.30 A: ah my there's quite a big range between like my ah
