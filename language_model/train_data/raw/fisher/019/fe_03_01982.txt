0.79 4.71 B: hello my name is janet bolan what's your name 

4.02 7.42 A: my name is barbara maddocks how are you janet 

7.04 8.84 B: okay how are you 

8.10 11.04 A: [laughter] fine this is my first call so 

10.64 14.02 B: mine also [laughter] we're both new to this 

11.36 19.35 A: [laughter] all right okay so we're going to talk about corporate scandals all right um 

16.72 17.88 B: yeah 

19.69 24.75 A: i'm not sure that i'm stung by corporate scandals i think that ah 

24.91 27.93 A: the nature of capitalism by definition 

27.97 33.53 A: leads to corporate scandals i mean i think the i i think the um the 

33.89 38.56 A: core value of capitalism is to make money at almost any cost 

38.55 50.41 A: and ah so these these people are doing that and in a country where you can't have decent housing or decent food or health care or anything unless you have money 

50.44 53.81 A: um people then get into a a 

54.25 59.55 A: mind set where where they will do anything to have money um 

59.58 63.73 A: and so i i i'm not really surprised and i think we 

63.68 76.36 A: go through cycles of this i mean i think this has happened before and then there's an outcry and then everybody claims to clean up their act and then five years later or ten years later we go through another outcry and 

76.24 81.03 A: people claim to clean up their act and then you know so on and so forth what do you think 

81.19 91.19 B: well i'm kind of in agreement with you um i used to work as a government contract auditor so i saw a lot of this [laughter] 

90.60 91.69 A: mhm 

91.41 92.38 B: and 

92.86 103.73 B: i guess it was an eye opening experience for me because i had really been raised to believe that most people were good and honest and would do the right thing and 

103.69 108.51 B: found out that that's not always the case and it's really disappointing 

106.23 107.16 A: mhm 

109.20 121.08 B: it's hard to teach your children to be honest and do the right thing when they see the the people who don't do that are the ones who have all the outside symbols of success in our society 

121.03 130.14 A: right right um you see this have you seen this latest thing in the newspaper about the ah the guy from american airlines um 

130.09 131.59 A: and how they 

131.53 142.50 A: created a pension fund that would fund a hundred per cent of their pension these are the top executives um meanwhile you know all of these airlines are two steps from bankruptcy 

137.57 138.62 B: yeah 

142.42 154.27 A: um and in addition that he was getting some other perks and some other money and so on and ah it was really a scandal and ah now the the most recent thing i saw is that 

154.22 167.85 A: ah the the unions involved with american airlines had agreed to concessions bec- you know to try to make it through this difficult time and once they found out about this executive and the and the perks that were 

162.33 163.47 B: yeah 

167.70 178.35 A: being given to them they've taken back their agreements now so it's really it's really um i i agree with you ah particularly that it's hard to 

178.53 189.95 A: i don't have children myself but i can imagine it's hard to teach children that honesty and fairness and kindness and all those kind of things are good good values to have 

179.89 180.77 B: mhm 

189.94 195.24 A: when the people that they see who are most successful and living the good life 

195.87 198.59 A: don't have those values you 

199.40 203.03 B: yeah i'm encouraged by the 

203.05 208.80 B: steps that they do take when they catch 'em i just don't think that most of it gets caught 

208.23 209.50 A: (( know mm mm )) 

210.68 211.55 A: well 

210.81 214.41 B: i think there needs to be really strict penalties and 

214.94 217.89 B: instead of slaps on the wrist 

217.15 218.41 A: (( mm mm )) 

218.28 224.16 B: because a million dollars when you're making ten million a year is really not very much 

222.83 236.43 A: right exactly it doesn't really hurt you very much and also i saw i think it was today's paper that um they're talking about you know this ah tax credit that poor working poor people could get 

236.39 249.93 A: um when they file they could get some additional moneys back well they're going to crack down on that and they're going to require all kinds of documentation that you're entitled to it but yet these people these c._e._o.s get away with you know 

249.71 259.79 A: economic murder and and ah particularly under this administration nobody seems to be concerned about that i mean it almost seems like 

259.68 262.74 A: once you get past a certain income level 

262.60 268.82 A: you can do whatever you want and nobody will question it but as long as you're a part of the working poor or the 

268.66 279.15 A: the poor middle class um you know then you've got to justify every single penny that you get back from the government and it seems to me there's something wrong with that um 

279.40 280.92 A: with that equation 

280.94 282.59 B: yeah i know 

282.70 288.86 B: they're um are supposedly reducing their labor costs by shipping everything down to mexico 

288.81 300.34 B: and yet the prices up here stay the same so where's the windfall going it's not going to our people for to put money in their pockets for food on their tables 

300.18 305.97 A: i know years ago i used to work for a company where we did some kind of um 

306.44 312.13 A: ah computer carting i can't remember exactly what the job was now but but 

312.71 323.35 A: it was then that i found out that these companies that it's more to their benefit to ship certain work to third world countries where they pay you know 

323.30 337.89 A: cents a day to the workers and have it sent have it um flown back than it is to pay american workers to do the job even though it you know involves time and so on it's to their benefit to do that so 

324.22 325.51 B: yeah 

337.75 339.47 A: (( i mean i think um )) 

339.51 343.43 A: in a sense that's part of these corporate scandals as well 

344.57 348.02 B: yes i do think you're right on that and ah 

348.99 355.15 B: you know ethics and business it's covered in other classes i have a degree in accounting 

355.14 364.45 B: and we really should have had a whole class just on ethics we didn't but i think that every business major should have to do that 

358.96 359.67 A: (( yes )) 

363.93 365.85 A: what school did you go to did 

365.25 368.63 B: i want to ball state in muncie indiana 

367.95 369.45 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

368.86 370.17 B: where are you from 

369.79 371.39 A: i'm from new york 

371.02 372.38 B: oh okay 

371.65 373.80 A: not from there still there 

373.96 374.77 B: um 

374.17 380.66 A: [laughter] do you feel that a degree in economics um was in a way 

381.17 390.69 A: um superficial in the sense that it didn't deal with these other these deeper issues of ethics and and how corporations behave 

390.84 396.70 B: well um my degree wasn't accounting i had a couple of classes in economics but 

393.70 394.60 A: okay 

396.81 404.77 B: what i feel is that we were given you know these are the rules and these are the standards and so on 

404.95 407.26 B: but there was never this 

407.61 420.13 B: class that perhaps would have said these are the kinds of things that people might ask you to do and you know decide whether it's ethical or not maybe even have group projects on that 

420.31 427.50 B: and you know brainstorm ideas of how to do things to be profitable and still be a 

427.94 430.74 B: you know ethical while you're doing it 

430.94 440.81 A: a a which leads me to one of the questions that's been in my mind what about these accounting firms like pricewaterhousecoopers and all these others i mean what 

442.11 449.61 A: you know i'm almost dismayed and and reluctant to say it but they seem to be part of the problem you know they seem to be 

449.79 460.05 A: whoever pays the bills they'll say whatever they want them to say um rather than you you are supposed to be getting an objective audit for instance 

459.49 471.09 B: yeah and they used to be very exclusionary towards women and minorities in their hiring practices and everything else and um 

471.45 474.82 B: personally that did not surprise me 

474.95 479.92 B: that you know in other areas they were less than honest and fair 

479.60 485.61 A: oh i see because of the way they handled the hiring you you felt there was um 

486.24 491.33 A: that this wouldn't be with beyond something they would do is that what you're saying 

491.08 493.43 B: yeah exactly um 

495.16 498.05 B: so [sigh] you know from a personal point of view 

498.20 503.72 B: it was kind of justice to me to see 'em get caught [laughter] 

501.40 503.23 A: [laughter] 

503.77 504.69 A: (( but )) 

503.90 518.48 B: but um you know in the big picture you're right we rely as a public if you're buying a stock you would like to know that the income statements that you base your decision to buy it on are right 

518.99 522.00 B: that you can believe what's written there 

522.42 526.18 B: and any more you can't it's just not worth 

527.76 531.36 B: it's not worth the ink it's printed with i'm afraid 

530.99 531.98 A: what 

532.18 536.41 A: do you have any idea how this can be solved i mean 

538.18 543.90 A: any suggestions as to what can be done to keep these corporations honest 

544.50 549.98 B: well of course um sending the culprits in it to prison 

549.52 550.74 A: mhm 

550.06 553.77 B: and i like the whistle blower laws that um 

552.53 553.54 A: mhm 

554.34 560.66 B: and enforcing them making it so that it is really not worth their hassle to 

560.72 570.34 B: um go after a whistle blower and keep them silent really having effective protections in place for those people and maybe 

564.54 565.50 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

570.39 573.94 B: honoring them as the heros that they are for 

574.49 578.67 B: doing the right thing even though it might be the most difficult thing 

579.97 590.94 A: and i'm i'm thinking about even in terms of sending these guys to prison i mean number one like you said they get slaps on the wrist in terms of fines which don't mean anything i mean i 

591.06 599.89 A: i'm not sure what they do as far as taxation but i i can imagine them writing any fines off as as against their taxes you know um 

598.63 599.89 B: yeah
