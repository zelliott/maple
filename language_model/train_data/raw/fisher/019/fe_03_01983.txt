16.67 22.32 B: ah how do i think that crime or anything else could be stopped in this country would be 

22.34 26.28 B: probably better law enforcement which would include 

26.32 32.09 B: better law enforcement officers because i think the police system is rather corrupt as well

96.81 99.71 B: and that shouldn't be 

100.56 106.13 B: i wish i were a little more intelligent i could come up with a really good answer for you because 

106.83 108.90 B: this has been going on for 

109.71 118.95 B: hundreds of years ah politics and ah organized crime sometimes work hand in hand 

119.19 124.14 B: as we know ah they have proven that with the kennedy administration 

124.70 132.27 B: kennedy was ah actually enlisting the mafia to ah help him get rid of castro but that kind of backfired 

133.26 134.70 B: (( and ah )) 

137.79 141.16 B: i'm sure there's been other presidents besides kennedy that's 

141.37 150.58 B: used the well it was the the mafia that also helped him get elected president they are the ones that brought west virginia in for him 

150.60 152.17 A: i didn't know that 

150.61 151.68 B: but 

152.04 155.05 B: oh [laughter] i didn't know you could answer me

161.94 162.89 B: uh-huh 

162.97 164.00 A: um 

164.18 168.79 A: this topic is kind of not my forte either to be quite honest 

167.76 177.73 B: well i guess you can tell it isn't mine because i'm not exactly against org- organized crime you know i wish i could say i was a hundred per cent but i'm not [laughter] 

173.65 174.58 A: (( [laughter] )) 

178.15 181.71 B: because sometimes they're a good thing 

181.92 186.69 B: you know if they had succeeded in eliminating ah castro i think that would have been a good thing 

187.01 187.76 A: yes 

187.78 190.17 A: no i agree with that um 

190.30 196.17 A: i've had a little bit of exposure to it um just 'cause i am also a finance major 

195.90 196.95 B: uh-huh 

196.23 201.92 A: um although that's not my main area of study but because i'm only a sophomore um 

202.60 209.13 A: no it didn't really affect me too much but my roommate who was graduating this year in a finance major um 

209.43 218.43 A: that really affected her when she was looking for a job this year because with all the crashes in the financial companies and all these financial advisors being corrupt 

217.88 219.15 B: (( mhm yes )) 

218.55 219.59 A: um 

220.18 222.02 B: and the bail out 

220.53 221.84 A: there was just a 

222.23 226.95 A: a limited job market so she had problems finding a job 

226.43 230.38 B: well martha stuart didn't lose too much money now did she [laughter] 

229.78 231.36 A: (( [laughter] )) 

231.37 238.90 B: and ah you know she knew when to sell out and left kmart holding the bag you know kmart is just about under 

239.01 240.93 A: yes it is 

240.33 244.52 B: walmart's kind of taking over everything this is all being recorded is it not 

244.36 245.45 A: yes 

245.29 249.90 B: okay well you know ah i was trying to get my 

250.02 262.25 B: cordless phone and my standard phone together because when they tell you to punch in a number i miss half of what they're saying [laughter] so what were we supposed to talk about at the very beginning 

257.60 259.34 A: [laughter] 

262.11 274.17 A: we're supposed to talk about how the government could curb how the government could do more to curb illegal business activity so what so what kind of laws they could enforce um 

270.18 271.85 B: illegal business activity 

274.03 277.76 A: to stop illegal illegal business activity um 

277.81 280.80 A: i think they could probably enforce more 

281.01 282.18 A: um 

283.47 288.46 A: more spot checks on the major corporations um 

288.57 291.23 B: there needs to be a little more regulation 

290.92 297.82 A: yes i mean they need to have someone look more at it 'cause i took accounting this semester and there are a lot of ways that you can 

297.98 299.53 B: hide your money 

298.93 301.51 A: hide the money um 

300.24 301.21 B: uh-huh 

301.65 311.24 A: and i realize that it would probably cost the government a significant amount but some of these employees were embezzling huge amounts of money which 

311.28 312.49 B: oh yes 

311.71 315.52 A: and and and companies besides enron 

313.59 315.07 B: you're going into 

315.36 317.96 B: you're going into like bookkeeping 

317.79 318.98 A: yeah 

318.62 323.07 B: well i don't mean anything against you but i [laughter] i know a couple of people 

323.14 330.57 B: even here in this little town who were now they weren't certified you know c._p._a.s but they kept books for some businesses 

327.99 328.99 A: mhm 

330.41 331.11 A: mhm 

330.55 341.76 B: local businesses they all ended up embezzling you know and these were like women that went to church every sunday and i guess the temptation is there so somehow there should be 

336.32 337.36 A: (( yeah )) 

341.95 348.71 B: like a a balance and check system going here i think 'cause when the money's gone it's too late 

346.06 347.14 A: yes 

349.60 351.36 A: (( very true very true )) 

351.38 352.42 B: i think 

351.83 355.18 A: what else are we supposed to be talking about um 

355.67 360.72 A: um do you think that the cascade of corporate scandals has caused the mild recession 

360.84 365.96 A: um has caused the mild recession and decline in u._s. stock market and economy 

365.23 367.04 B: oh absolutely 

367.09 368.55 B: (( because ah )) 

368.82 374.58 B: speaking for myself and a lot of people in my circle of friends you're afraid to invest 

374.67 378.78 B: and you're pulling your investments out and you're going into something that's safe 

379.13 380.00 B: you know 

380.16 381.00 A: yes 

380.34 384.26 B: like government bonds or whatever you don't want to risk losing your money any more 

384.77 385.90 B: (( you know )) 

384.92 392.28 A: that's a very valid point i hadn't thought of that just 'cause i don't invest so much i'm kind of borrowing oodles of money right now [laughter] 

390.11 398.85 B: yeah well when you get when you get a little bit older you might have a i don't have now don't misunderstand me i don't have a lot of money invested but i have enough that i don't want to lose it 

398.38 399.29 A: yes 

399.63 405.36 B: and you know there for a while the stock market was just going crazy and this money was 

405.65 413.59 B: doubling and tripling and i was making all this money on the stock market and then all of a sudden it's losing losing losing so you finally pull out 

413.91 428.43 B: and reinvest in ah something a little more secure but yes it is partly due to all the scandals because people don't have they lost their trust i know you know if um 

425.30 426.25 A: (( yes )) 

429.79 431.54 B: (( if somebody like )) 

430.32 433.09 A: it's it's not worth it if you got to 

431.90 445.05 B: right if somebody lies to you even as an individual or tells something that shouldn't have been told you know like giving these little tip offs on when to bail out and sell your stock and what is that insider 

446.22 447.21 A: information 

446.96 451.76 B: insider information well when you find these things out you lose your trust 

452.64 457.81 B: and you look at somebody who is very very rich say martha stuart 

457.59 458.55 A: mhm 

457.87 462.68 B: and she lost next to nothing and the other stockholders lost 

460.25 461.04 A: (( yes )) 

462.65 477.25 B: their arse [laughter] and kmart's going under and she's still on television planting flowers so you know you do lose your trust in investing and in the government because i think well the government 

464.64 465.41 A: (( yes )) 

477.43 478.50 B: it is ah 

478.61 484.49 B: the penalties and the laws are real strict about insider information but it doesn't seem like they enforce them that much 

486.05 489.35 B: i mean if you've got some insider information 

490.03 494.64 B: just hypothetically hypothetically you were going to ah 

491.36 492.47 A: mhm 

494.71 499.61 B: make say ten million dollars would that be worth going to jail for eight months 

500.36 502.35 A: i think it might be 

501.60 503.74 B: i think it might be yes yeah 

503.18 508.19 A: 'cause as long as you can gift that money away and they can't take it away from you 

506.73 508.33 B: (( i think )) 

508.40 516.31 B: i think i'd go to jail for eight months or a year and read books while i was there and [laughter] hope that nothing bad happened to me 

508.62 509.65 A: you know it 

515.48 518.29 A: wouldn't look too good on the resume but you know 

517.88 528.71 B: yeah it doesn't look good on the resume well maybe [laughter] you know maybe if you went to jail [laughter] you'd get a free education they put a lot of them through college now 

518.45 521.31 A: after if you make enough money you don't 

528.90 529.93 A: (( [laughter] )) 

530.13 531.85 B: [laughter] which is kind of 

532.86 537.22 B: different [laughter] you know how much punishment is that 

537.77 545.29 B: go to jail and get a free education but yeah i think we need stricter laws and better enforcement of the laws 

545.99 549.25 B: for the people who who are doing these things 

549.70 551.32 B: what do you think 

551.31 559.12 A: i'm just wondering how you could um enforce the laws i mean i agree you need to have stricter ones but 

558.87 561.10 B: well like i said ah 

561.09 565.43 A: 'cause i mean even if you just look at the um airport security now 

565.05 565.99 B: oh 

565.46 571.57 A: which i mean that's costing millions and millions of dollars and is it really any better 

567.96 569.63 B: millions and millions 

571.85 573.20 B: some say 

572.12 575.50 A: i mean i think it's better but is it 

574.64 586.78 B: i'm hoping it's better [laughter] i sure am hoping every time i get on a plane i'm hoping the security was real good i know they didn't give me any trouble but then you know i'm older 

587.23 589.74 B: i don't know what they're looking for but ah 

589.87 596.90 B: you know i had very little trouble just ah as far as getting through security it was time delays that were 

597.27 598.65 B: a big nuisance 

598.59 599.50 A: mhm 

598.74 599.41 B: but
