2.27 4.65 A: hi my name is sherry how are you 

4.38 6.40 B: okay how are you 

5.68 9.88 A: i'm okay i didn't quite hear what [laughter] the whole topic is 

8.10 13.29 B: i'm lucille the topic was what can the government do to 

13.57 14.14 B: (( [cough] )) 

14.15 20.96 B: improve business practices i guess it was a little unclear i couldn't get all the words 

19.08 22.62 A: okay like corporation corruption they thinking about that enron 

21.80 27.74 B: yeah oh yes i ah yeah i have some very ah how do you feel about it 

23.03 24.17 A: and 

27.15 28.88 A: okay well let me see 

28.93 38.71 A: would the government do another intervention of the government well i think if we had better ah policing if you have major corporations and businesses like that 

38.61 48.64 A: don't they have to file you know paperwork and and taxes and account how many shop you know stocks and bonds that they have when they account you know um 

48.41 56.23 A: to account for their shareholders and that should be like public record and someone should of been able to see that for example enron 

56.46 58.40 A: wasn't um 

58.28 61.76 A: um getting the profits that they say they were getting 

61.59 73.39 A: and that they were losing money continuously and then after and particularly with that enron situation they had a woman who worked there who went to you know i guess she was a whistle whistle blower 

72.24 73.93 B: that's right yeah 

73.26 77.41 A: and said all of this was happening and nothing was done 

77.45 80.15 A: so i i don't know what more than 

79.28 90.14 B: yeah well that's not what more the government can do you know these um corporations officers accountants were breaking the law 

83.37 84.46 A: mhm 

89.71 90.95 A: mhm 

90.46 95.29 B: and i don't [mn] believe that nobody had an inkling 

95.43 98.46 B: i think part of the problem is that 

97.64 101.73 A: what do you mean nobody noone in the organization itself 

101.44 107.93 B: or even in ah the securities and exchange commission which is supposed to regulate them 

105.62 106.54 A: okay 

107.56 108.46 A: right 

108.16 110.16 B: ah because um 

110.93 116.36 B: they so many of these corporations have ties to the government 

116.43 122.18 B: you know and the vice president ah was doing the transition right after election 

121.80 122.87 A: right 

122.37 125.15 B: and ah he had a group of ah 

125.34 140.04 B: people coming in to advise him on what energy policies they should promulgate and what legislation they should ask for enron representatives were sitting at the table and they were help writing the proposals 

133.50 134.50 A: mhm 

139.53 140.48 A: mhm 

140.08 150.26 B: if these corporations were not allowed to give so much money to the political parties and the political candidates 

148.05 149.39 A: mhm 

149.83 151.14 A: mhm 

150.46 155.09 B: they would have much less influence i think that's part of it 

152.87 158.48 A: right so they think everybody else is looking the other way because they've donated 

156.43 169.13 B: yeah i i really think so and the other thing that the security and exchange commission um could crack down um you know nobody has gone to jail yet 

158.64 160.10 A: mhm 

165.20 166.37 A: mhm 

168.69 170.26 A: right what you what 

169.86 180.68 B: yeah you know they think after a while people will just forget all about it and um it'll be swept under the rug and that's that and the contributions and the 

174.19 175.25 A: mhm 

180.75 188.95 B: ah will go on now vice president chaney was an officer of halliburton before he was elected 

184.69 185.88 A: mhm 

188.32 189.20 A: yes 

189.02 190.91 B: and halliburton 

191.07 197.01 B: [cough] just pardon me just got a big contract ah in iraq 

193.20 194.57 A: you okay 

194.59 195.68 A: mhm 

196.69 198.95 A: okay yeah mhm 

197.10 198.06 B: (( ah )) 

198.27 204.51 B: condoleezza rice was involved with a big oil company i think it was chevron 

199.58 202.41 A: mhm i read that 

204.04 205.38 A: mhm 

204.70 212.62 B: you know um they're just there's just no line drawn between government and corporations 

206.17 207.11 A: so 

212.09 213.30 A: mhm 

212.73 215.78 B: and ah they're in bed with each other 

215.33 221.71 A: mhm but i think a lot of this is still when you mention the security exchange commission if you have a company 

221.57 235.56 A: like enron if you start dumping a lot of stock you know prior to things like that should of been a red flag right there and then the stock holders should of known and i guess i don't know does the s._e._c. fall under government control 

225.33 226.67 B: that's right 

235.57 236.75 A: if um 

236.97 241.35 B: yeah well yeah the head of the s._e._c. is appointed by the president 

237.37 238.48 A: because they 

240.88 242.06 A: right right 

241.87 246.09 B: and ah again you know the ah they 

246.16 253.95 B: they're not strict they look the other way for one thing they don't want to rock the market they don't want to see the stocks go down 

252.94 254.72 A: right right 

254.08 262.86 B: and for another thing you know they're all buddies they're all ah profiting and they're all ah drinking from the same trough 

258.55 259.85 A: (( [laughter] )) 

261.65 272.10 A: same deal which which scares me when you see big government and they want now they just says well let's take all our money out of social security and let you invest it in you know you can do 

272.28 280.18 A: you know stocks and bonds or you know whatever and i'm just saying i don't think that's a great idea if you have all of this corruption 

273.39 274.71 B: mhm 

280.04 283.18 B: oh there's no way you would get me to do that 

280.28 287.98 A: you know you could take you to do that you think yeah this is off their topic but it it's still all the same with me 

285.51 286.68 B: you know 

287.72 297.29 B: i'm on a pension and half of it is tied to the stock market it's variable in other words if the market goes up my pension goes up 

289.67 290.90 A: mhm 

294.42 295.40 A: (( right but )) 

296.80 299.45 A: that kind of thing you would you would get more 

297.34 301.42 B: i've lost hundreds of dollars every month because of this 

299.72 300.66 A: (( mhm )) 

300.83 305.02 A: but they were saying you would get more with the other way that you know bush is planning it 

303.00 317.76 B: that's right at least my social security is fixed you know it's a fixed amount i know i'm going to get it i hope [laughter] and ah there's no way i'm going to invest it in the stock market it's just too uncertain 

307.47 308.61 A: mhm 

310.46 312.00 A: [laughter] right right 

315.32 316.49 A: right 

316.98 322.60 A: but it would be be invested with government controls that what they were saying and i'm just gonna 

320.83 327.51 B: well you know the government are supposed to be controlling what's going on right now and i'm not impressed at all 

326.47 328.64 A: [laughter] 

327.56 330.73 B: you know i really don't trust them 

329.35 330.49 A: mhm 

330.78 335.20 B: um they ah play around with social security money 

334.65 336.67 A: right mhm 

336.01 341.73 B: ah they you know include it in their income with their budget amounts 

341.03 342.07 A: mhm 

341.72 352.48 B: and ah social security money is used to ah to finance government bonds and they only pay something like a very low percentage 

347.82 349.06 A: mhm 

351.92 353.46 A: (( mhm yep )) 

352.53 366.42 B: ah i really think they're cheating the ah social security fund and they're using it for political purposes i just don't trust the government ah to go any further with my retirement money i just don't 

356.75 357.85 A: mhm 

360.68 362.45 A: right well you 

363.13 364.19 A: mhm 

364.91 367.18 A: well you still think that 

367.41 379.39 A: um in light of everything else that like the big corporations should they should the government say look you cannot donate donate any money to any political action funds at all you think that would help with the corruption 

379.35 387.28 A: if we put a i know there is a limit i know there's a personal limit on people like two thousand dollars that's as much you can donate to anybody 

379.38 381.90 B: i think so i really do 

386.18 394.97 B: yes but the corporations you know ah they contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars you know they can get away with it 

394.96 406.66 B: ah and their officers and they use relatives and friends but the corporations are not regulated as far as contributions the same as ah as individuals 

398.53 399.48 A: mhm 

401.66 402.79 A: mhm 

403.79 409.21 A: i was saying if the government put a cap on the amount that they could donate maybe 

407.35 408.28 B: yes 

409.11 419.92 A: you know a lot of people would stop looking the other way because you know we're not greasing anybody's palms that way but i kind of figure they'll find some other way around it would be the business trip 

417.64 418.51 B: but 

418.57 430.07 B: you know there's another problem a lot of these corporation executives get jobs in the government you know the vice president condoleezza rice i'm sure there are many others 

425.62 426.93 A: mhm 

428.04 429.00 A: right 

429.42 430.72 A: mhm 

430.10 438.88 B: and then a lot of the people who leave government agencies and positions then they go and they're you know directors of corporations 

438.26 440.92 A: mhm right they go into private industry mhm 

438.89 449.31 B: so there there's no separation there has to be legislation to separate and also the legislation that exists right now is not being enforced 

448.72 449.76 A: mhm 

449.33 452.60 B: you know people that committed criminal acts 

452.54 465.75 B: are getting away with it and ordinary working people have lost a lot of money they've lost money in their retirement funds and their savings you know people who depended on their stock dividends to 

454.16 454.98 A: mhm 

464.89 467.05 A: yeah yeah absolutely 

466.01 467.43 B: for their income 

467.32 470.82 A: 'cause you know i lost all my my four oh one you know and 

469.85 471.02 B: oh dear 

470.87 473.96 A: i was like oh my god i'm still fairly young 

473.85 482.39 A: but you know i can get a bounce back but a lot of these people like if you've worked twenty and thirty and forty years for a place and then lose all your money 

482.22 496.14 A: and um there they should be like like a survivor fund that's what the government should have when those big corporations um fold under or go bankrupt these people should at least get back twenty per cent or thirty per cent of their money 

495.85 505.30 B: yeah but the trouble is the money doesn't go to investors now the government provided millions of dollars to airlines you know who were going bankrupt 

503.11 504.61 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

504.74 505.86 A: right 

505.15 512.33 B: but the investors and people who lost money on the stock market investing in those airlines didn't get a penny 

509.21 510.32 A: mhm 

511.89 513.05 A: mhm 

512.35 513.82 B: they got nothing 

513.82 515.99 A: oh yeah that's yeah 

515.96 522.26 B: ah it's just i think the government is worried so much about protecting corporations 

521.50 522.85 A: mhm 

522.30 532.88 B: and they try to persuade us that ah if the corporations and business is all right then the little people will be all right too but that's not necessarily so 

530.03 531.12 A: mhm 

532.43 535.11 A: (( oh i understand i i see )) 

535.21 544.38 A: well what else was on that topic list [laughter] other than ah you know i don't know and i guess i guess we're sorta agreeing on this um 

537.61 538.70 B: yeah 

544.68 549.83 A: i don't know you're saying that government should just have more um legislation 

550.03 554.66 A: to prevent such a such things that have been happening in big business corruption 

553.00 559.82 B: or at least say when somebody is the head of a corporation they can't go right into government 

559.74 568.65 B: there should be a time lapse and when somebody leaves the government i don't think they should be able to go immediately to work for a corporation 

563.37 564.46 A: mhm 

568.21 569.31 A: mhm 

568.71 581.14 B: because if these deals are in the works you know they know that if you do what the corporations want you're gonna get a nice job as a a director the directors make millions of dollars a year 

580.62 583.43 A: or you could become a lobby list a lobbyist 

582.94 586.45 B: oh the lobbyists oh that's another story yeah 

583.69 594.23 A: [laughter] that's like you know like chaney and all of those and condoleezza rice you know they were like lobbyists you know prior to their their their they go to um 

589.66 591.12 B: mhm 

594.41 599.95 A: give their clients you know reflect their clients' best interests on the hill so favorable legislation
