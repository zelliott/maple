80.36 84.90 B: yeah it's a very interesting time for our family so i'm definitely 

84.92 91.93 B: ah oh in a position to talk about this topic because i've been thinking about it a lot lately and sort of revisiting what 

92.04 101.44 B: what i what my vision or image of my family is 'cause it's getting to be a little well it's getting shattered basically so

124.19 126.70 B: okay cool thanks um 

125.55 128.01 A: anyway you can just call me when you get a chance 

127.74 128.67 B: okay 

128.50 129.44 A: um 

128.71 137.74 B: yeah so it's just stressful but um but i guess i guess my what family means to me has sort of changed um 

138.32 145.85 B: over the years in general but at this time it sort of means um who you choose as family and 

145.87 146.82 B: um 

147.87 149.30 B: (( are you there )) 

148.94 150.22 A: yeah 

149.74 162.31 B: and just you know what some of those bonds are like i've found that over the years i've actually chosen my own family in my friends because of just you know the way that those relationships have gone and 

162.07 163.31 A: yeah 

162.62 166.23 B: and have actually kind of surpassed what my family 

166.32 168.35 B: has been able to provide in a way 

168.47 172.29 A: well you know i know i've done the same thing i mean i've got 

168.56 169.53 B: so 

172.33 177.19 A: i don't think family exactly means biological you know so 

176.31 177.27 B: mhm 

177.73 184.31 A: you know and it's funny because i just lost both of my parents i mean they they both died in the last three years 

181.27 182.61 B: oh wow 

184.20 185.34 B: oh no 

184.89 190.66 A: and there are five kids in my family i've got two brothers and two sisters and 

190.84 203.40 A: you know through a div- i mean you're in a divorce you're grieving something and and when they die you're grieving and that you know it's almost like you can see how family stress affects each family member 

196.71 197.74 B: right 

203.75 206.96 A: and it's almost like you get to know them through a tragedy 

204.19 205.39 B: yeah 

207.25 208.51 A: almost 

207.89 215.22 B: that's true and it almost seems that when you choose your own family by you know choosing to have that commitment with 

215.61 217.04 B: feels like family 

216.62 217.58 A: uh-huh 

217.16 222.41 B: somehow it seems easier to weather the hard stuff 

222.47 235.84 B: in that relationship than with biological family and i don't know why why is it that we you know expect i guess different things or we put more difficult things on our biological family members and so on 

223.68 224.92 A: right 

235.56 238.70 A: i think because we're still holding on to 

238.94 243.00 A: maybe sometimes grudges or things that we grew up with 

243.09 249.84 A: i don't know but it's like i got to know my sister so much better through this through all this 

249.85 251.12 A: going on 

251.18 252.06 B: mhm 

251.21 260.18 A: and one sister i became so much closer to and the other one i was just so sad about how greedy she was 

260.17 262.48 B: wow you mean when your parents died 

261.84 264.43 A: yeah because i was the trustee 

264.27 266.89 B: mm oh i see [laughter] 

266.02 274.98 A: and you know and all of it there's always one in every family they say [laughter] and the five of us the four the 

271.36 272.49 B: mhm 

274.89 283.88 A: other four we were won- you know we were wonderful supportive and but the this one just oh my god it was it was so sad 

283.63 286.81 B: gosh yeah you know what's that about 

286.66 296.91 A: i know what is especially when she was what you know my mother's family did and you know it's like you at least try to learn from the past but 

287.40 288.66 B: (( [laughter] )) 

296.32 299.08 B: mhm exactly 

297.82 303.03 A: but one of the things i miss the most is family i haven't lived near family in 

303.39 305.09 A: twenty five years 

305.14 311.70 A: i haven't lived in the same town with you know i've got a brother in vermont a brother in florida a sister in california 

305.22 306.14 B: (( mm )) 

311.96 313.07 B: oh wow 

312.69 318.19 A: and and i'm in washington and my parents lived in dallas [laughter] 

317.26 323.25 B: hey [laughter] well it meant you had at least had some place to crash in every place you went 

323.33 325.60 A: i know i know 

324.36 325.30 B: [laughter] 

326.48 327.44 A: um 

326.54 330.05 B: that's interesting what you say about the trustee factor 

329.71 332.25 A: oh my gosh i could give an i 

330.17 332.50 B: because my mom actually 

332.34 334.86 A: could give an education on that 

334.24 345.09 B: well i bet and 'cause well my mom was the executor when her mom died and she has two brothers and oh my goodness i did not know there was such ugliness 

340.05 340.98 A: uh-huh 

345.05 346.48 A: i know you don't 

345.30 347.17 B: inside those people 

346.78 352.18 A: it's almost like you don't know your family until there's a death or you don't know your husband until you divorce him 

352.09 358.68 B: right [laughter] that one i believe too 'cause i've been there [laughter] 

353.24 354.17 A: [laughter] 

356.78 358.82 A: [laughter] me too 

360.71 375.44 B: yeah no yeah okay and so in a way and i mean this of course with all sarcasm and humor but that's kind of the ideal you know way of where you can say okay let's let's be family now and you can say okay let's not 

375.62 377.65 A: (( i know i know )) 

376.48 379.06 B: [laughter] 

377.74 379.84 A: it's it's true and 

379.96 385.62 A: it's like now my one of my sisters and i we're more like friends now rather than sisters 

385.67 387.15 B: mhm that's cool 

385.69 387.71 A: you know because of all this 

387.89 389.22 B: mm good 

388.45 389.87 A: and um 

390.44 393.55 A: and my other sister she's like an acquaintance now 

393.42 394.42 B: mhm 

394.08 398.40 A: but my twin brother and i i mean we're still the exact same [laughter] 

397.38 398.77 B: mhm [laughter] 

400.10 408.12 A: but um i miss living near family especially when someone one of them's in need you know 

407.05 407.98 B: mhm 

408.20 412.04 A: you want to help them but you can't get there to help them 

409.98 411.01 B: yeah 

412.00 421.19 B: yeah i actually miss my brother the most 'cause he lives um back out east with my parents well near where my parents live like a few hours away 

412.92 413.74 A: or 

421.44 431.51 B: and i just oh my brother and i grew up so close the whole time we didn't have like the sibling rivalry that a lot of kids have and really love each other and 

425.24 426.27 A: (( oh )) 

428.64 430.01 A: yeah 

431.40 437.26 B: i think that's what i miss the most you know when you say that that's what rings a bell for me is oh my brother you know 

436.44 438.02 A: (( i know )) 

438.31 442.68 A: i know i miss i tried to get my my other brother to move out here

473.83 475.41 B: [laughter] 

474.61 477.28 A: and it's basically 'cause i'm jealous 

477.14 479.63 B: yeah yeah 

478.07 488.79 A: [laughter] you know and they're having barbecues and i'm going i hate you [laughter] they always invite me though but so i adopted the family across the street 

482.61 484.13 B: yeah 

488.55 490.46 B: well see there you go 

490.01 491.35 A: (( yeah ))

514.66 520.48 B: mhm oh well then they are your family [laughter] 'cause that goes back to that whole 

520.55 525.57 B: thing about you know what separates real family from you know 

525.81 527.18 A: yeah 

525.86 526.64 B: like a 

526.58 528.42 B: pseudo family or something that

552.16 559.57 A: try to fix it you just want them to accept you okay okay sometimes i'm in a good mood sometimes in a bad mood [laughter] 

553.74 555.06 B: [laughter] 

556.93 557.73 B: yeah
