211.73 212.53 A: it was 

215.53 221.20 A: well directly of course was al qaeda from what i understand from what what i've i've read ah 

219.01 220.12 B: right 

222.38 231.12 A: bin laden was actually you know we kind of supported him way back in the day when he was fighting the soviets in afghanistan 'cause you know 

230.20 232.09 B: i didn't even know that 

231.39 239.17 A: yeah 'cause he was you know fighting all those nasty communist types and then he got upset at us 

235.98 237.56 B: right 

239.19 248.93 A: in the first gulf war because our troops were stationed in what he considered to be the holy land of saudi arabia i might add of course that there 

249.26 251.35 A: ah the arabians 

251.41 252.81 A: you know i 

253.24 260.58 A: don't know whether request but certainly with their their their blessing but that's when he turned against the united states 

253.48 254.38 B: right

269.38 270.85 B: really 

270.06 271.98 A: yeah

293.41 294.62 B: oh 

295.01 300.33 B: so you don't feel that we're being threatened by any other countries then in your opinion 

300.51 306.08 B: well i really don't have anything to to strongly base my opinion on only by 

306.36 314.59 B: i mean that's just the general feeling in in new york that that we're being threatened constantly and to be aware constantly 

309.04 310.37 A: yeah 

314.01 328.01 A: yeah i guess i mean i'm i'm sure that there are terrorists and i'm i'm certain there there gonna be some other terrorist activities of different degrees and in different places different places yeah if 

323.94 327.41 B: right but they they you know the pol- right 

328.25 337.97 A: i certainly don't foresee that a country as a country is going to attack us you know i don't

338.62 339.72 A: (( ah )) 

340.58 342.32 A: like i said i'm sure that 

340.96 348.12 B: or it could be that people from that country influencing other countries to um join in a attack 

347.74 349.74 A: yeah i mean 

349.81 358.49 A: there's there's lots of people that don't like us and i'm sure when somebody like al qaeda or something like that does something against us that they're not 

353.33 354.22 B: i mean 

358.17 361.51 B: al qaeda is is just generally a group right 

362.94 365.04 A: yeah
