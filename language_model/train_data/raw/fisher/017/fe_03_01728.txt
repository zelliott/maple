0.60 1.85 B: hello 

1.28 3.18 A: hello this is 

2.51 3.49 B: (( hi )) 

3.53 4.32 B: [noise] 

3.71 7.02 A: hi this is dee from atlanta [noise] 

7.35 10.99 B: oh hi dee my name's alisa i live in manhattan campus 

10.89 12.71 A: oh okay what's your name 

13.00 13.90 B: (( alisa )) 

13.71 15.16 A: (( alisa okay )) 

14.88 15.85 B: [noise] 

15.70 22.32 A: um so what are your thoughts on the subject do you think we're threatened by any other countries 

18.38 20.89 B: (( yeh [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

22.29 23.20 B: um 

23.34 29.19 B: i i wouldn't say that i think another country is a threat i think there are probably individual 

29.74 31.16 A: exactly 

29.83 36.89 B: that are a threat but i i wouldn't say i'm scared of another coun- not like the cold war you know with russia everybody was frightened of it but 

37.15 38.43 B: (( what do you think )) 

38.32 39.51 A: well 

39.57 45.74 A: um [sigh] i i i feel that way sort of i don't think a whole country will 

45.65 57.34 A: you know try to harm us but i do feel like a large number of people from where i don't really know [laughter] because we are not the most popular people at the time 

49.19 49.77 B: (( [noise] )) 

49.86 50.47 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

56.03 58.41 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] exact )) 

57.35 61.03 A: but i do believe that this is not the end of it 

61.03 62.73 B: yeah 

61.40 72.58 A: for some reason i do think that the middle east will revive i think that um you know the two people we're looking for the most the most wanteds osama and saddam 

72.55 76.78 A: i think they will maybe get together and we will hear from them again 

76.68 80.44 B: [noise] [noise] yeah that's i hadn't thought about that that would be a frightening thing [laughter] 

80.19 87.75 A: oh it's going to be very frightening [noise] but um you know i feel like they're not just going to go away that easily 

82.23 83.45 B: yeah 

87.64 94.62 B: i yeah that's true it does seem like everything kinda went a little bit too easily in iraq 

88.63 89.64 A: you know 

94.30 95.44 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

94.98 100.13 B: but you know it will be interesting to see how it all plays out the other thing that kinda worries me is 

100.00 113.74 B: the fact that like france and germany weren't behind us in going into iraq and then you think okay if there's another country out there and they start getting countries like germany and france on their side there's the possibility that [noise] you know 

113.54 117.32 A: yeah but do you think france and germany would go to that extreme though 

114.32 114.90 B: (( be )) 

117.51 126.14 B: i don't think so at this point no but just the fact that they were so vocal about how much they thought we were wrong how wrong they thought we were 

125.84 132.65 A: well you know to me it's um it's a cultural th- [mn] i can't talk it's a cultural thing 

130.81 131.99 B: (( it kinda [laughter] )) 

132.50 133.59 B: mhm 

132.97 140.69 A: because um if you really think about the germans and um you know the french people they are you know 

140.89 149.43 A: they have certain ways of doing things and they're just you know a knack for doing this they have to do it this way or it's not done you know 

149.01 150.39 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

149.25 162.09 A: so to me i really think and i totally agreed with them we were not supposed to be attacking [laughter] them at the time we did that we didn't give the talking long enough to take hold 

158.02 159.01 B: right 

161.28 163.40 B: yeah i agree 

162.36 176.84 A: so um i don't think france or germany will ever go to go with an extremist group like that you know i think they're gonna always be the ones sitting on the fence scared to lose what they have scared to get involved 

169.82 170.91 B: yeah 

176.74 185.69 A: and wanting everybody to do things their way but um i don't think they'll ever you know group up with you know someone that extreme 

185.38 192.30 B: yeah i don't think someone that extreme but just they're i think there's definitely a a small opening in the doorway for 

192.41 198.92 B: for people to gang up on america but i don't i mean that's not something that i would lose sleep over it at all [laughter] 

198.54 199.65 A: yeah 

199.75 201.13 B: (( but [mn] )) 

200.45 211.95 A: um i do expect to see something else you know but like you i'm i'm with you i'm not going to um ruin the quality of my life by fearing for my life 

211.83 215.79 A: you know on a daily basis or whatever i'm just going to 

215.67 221.20 A: you know keep it in the back of my mind that you know i need to try to be as safe as possible and 

221.02 230.98 A: i think finally we're taking a right step as far as you know putting reinforced doors in cockpits and you know things of this nature 

221.21 222.18 B: yeah 

230.94 236.14 A: so um i'm not going to sweat that but i do believe they will be back 

236.29 237.44 B: yeah 

237.51 241.19 B: i mean i do think i think you know with all the measures they're taking [noise] 

241.14 252.63 B: i think a lot of it is for the public as opposed to it because i feel like if they if somebody really wanted to you know hijack another airplane and crash it into a building they would be able to do it 

252.74 254.86 B: and the safety measures they're seeking 

253.46 255.99 A: it would be so much harder though 

256.17 260.19 B: mm yeah that's true that is true but i just think things are 

258.53 262.66 A: see before they didn't meet with any resistance whatsoever 

262.10 263.42 B: [laughter] that's true 

263.50 265.17 B: [laughter] it was tougher 

263.69 268.63 A: and this time would be so much harder to do you know 

268.52 276.93 B: yeah that is tru- i just think it's funny that you know you get on the airplane and they won't give you ah a real knife they'll give you a plastic knife but they'll give you a fork and a spoon 

276.92 286.61 B: i i'm like can't you do more damage with a fork than you could with a knife [laughter] but i think things like that [mn] i think it's more for public like the public than it is actually 

286.71 301.11 B: being that effective but but i would say like i'm more ah frightened of terrorists you know small radical groups of people doing things like bombing you know terrorist activities than i am of an actual another country ever coming in and 

300.95 304.94 B: taking over america or starting a war here or anything like that 

304.78 305.87 A: yeah 

305.79 306.54 B: (( ah )) 

306.12 314.07 A: i i think ah the it wouldn't be a whole country i don't have that fear whatsoever i think it would be you know ah 

310.13 311.79 B: yeah 

313.85 321.34 A: nuclear that you know everybody got together and say let's go do this to the u._s. because they did this and they did that and 

320.72 322.27 B: (( yeah )) 

321.57 325.80 A: you know they they have some points they have some good points [laughter] 

325.29 327.32 B: yeah that's true [laughter] 

326.28 328.54 A: (( you know so um )) 

327.72 340.97 B: but then you've got to think of the countries that used to be super powers and you know they obviously they sell because we're you know they major super power now and we weren't always so it's interesting it can happen but i definitely think we're raised here in the u._s. 

340.89 345.47 B: kinda with the idea that we're indestructible and you know 

345.67 347.53 A: but you know that's stupid 

347.78 348.93 B: (( yeah [noise] mhm )) 

347.94 356.63 A: that that is stupid and i think our government have um really done us a grave injustice by 

356.98 360.36 A: orienting us to that lifestyle 

359.62 361.17 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

360.58 366.48 A: because in my opinion if we had had always and think about al- when you travel abroad 

366.25 376.51 A: all of these places have some type of measures that they take you can only go so far if you don't have a ticket in the airport and things like that you know 

376.34 387.99 A: we didn't do any of that you know we're the best we're the baddest and we can do whatever we want whenever we want and they just walked right in and took away a bunch of our people 

376.37 377.29 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

383.53 384.65 B: exactly 

387.95 399.04 A: so um to me they really have done us more harm than good by not really exposing us to terrorism in the past because it has always been there 

388.11 388.98 B: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

398.86 407.81 B: [noise] [noise] oh i know also when they say they had an idea of what was going to happen [noise] and they just didn't want to frighten people it's like hello [laughter] 

404.17 405.52 A: (( i know can )) 

405.82 406.97 A: (( you imagine )) 

407.05 409.21 A: but how dumb are we 

408.61 415.38 B: [laughter] i know i almost think that our own government is more of a danger to us sometimes than another country's government would be 

415.93 417.10 A: well 

416.10 417.58 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

417.43 428.88 A: you know how that goes everybody's entitled to think what they want and we're so busy fussing among ourselves after what we want we really can't even get you know out of the door way 

428.67 430.16 B: mhm 

429.28 443.08 A: you know to address bigger problems like terrorism but i think terrorism is here to stay and um so far it seems like they're stepping to the plate taking all you know a lot of precautions not all but 

430.32 431.00 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

443.14 452.35 A: you know i think as i said it seems we really need to get with them and go with the flow you know because when you travel now so many people are complaining about the wait 

451.76 453.59 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] [noise] oh )) 

452.85 462.58 A: and everything else i mean just sort of hold it in and go with it you know because i'd rather go through that than them not having any sanctions in place at all 

461.41 466.81 B: i know [noise] oh exactly and those are probably the same people that would be complaining if there was no you know 

466.32 467.69 A: exactly 

467.31 475.55 B: in place but it's very frustrating to hear that like we're all going through the same thing it doesn't help when you're complaining about this [laughter] 

467.90 469.18 A: exactly 

470.27 471.37 A: yeah 

474.51 484.85 A: but you know the demeanor is totally different they just sort of stand there with a scowl on their face because you know they have to be two hours earlier an hour earlier whatever you know 

484.47 485.64 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

484.87 488.62 A: and um to me terrorism is not going to 

488.52 489.99 A: dissipate 

489.79 504.45 A: it has always been there we were just naive to the fact you know the public was our leaders knew what was going on but you know like you said they didn't want to bother us they didn't want us to think that we were at risk in any way 

489.85 491.22 B: yeah 

493.54 494.98 B: (( yeah exac- [mn] mhm )) 

504.44 506.92 A: and then all of a sudden boom 

507.17 516.93 A: and now you know we got to be faced with it we got to stand up and take notice of what's going on and how much do we really love our country 

516.29 518.32 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah exactly )) 

517.16 518.20 A: you know 

518.63 524.24 B: yeah i i'm really surprised at the impact it had on kinda patriotism within the u._s. how 

524.30 532.51 B: how all of a sudden everybody was just pro america and and i think it was starting to fade a little bit and then the war happened and now it's really back up again but 

531.91 532.96 A: yeah 

532.56 536.30 B: that's a really interesting kinda consequence of all this is [laughter] [noise] 

535.37 542.44 A: it it sort of appears to me and you know i guess i'm conditioned as an american also i just 

542.21 556.36 A: stayed at that they conditioned us to be a certain way and but um you know i'm i'm that way and to me they're only doing it [laughter] because of the war when it's over it'll all be gone you know [laughter] 

554.43 557.91 B: yeah until something else happens [laughter] i know [laughter] 

557.00 562.21 A: i know i know you won't see everybody wearing red and white and blue 

560.33 561.84 B: [noise] 

562.51 565.60 A: but it shouldn't take that to bring us together 

565.15 574.06 B: no it shouldn't it really shouldn't but but i must say that was that was one thing that was really nice after especially nine eleven was 

573.61 574.84 A: oh yeah 

574.10 586.21 B: amazing how everybody just pulled together and because i think i mean i have i'm twenty seven and i have i don't think i've ever felt that in my life you know there hasn't been one kinda singular event to define you know 

586.50 590.92 A: well it was it was pretty much so and desert storm 

586.78 588.69 B: define my life yet 

591.53 598.41 A: you know we went over to rescue kuwait and everything and everybody was really pro american 

592.51 593.89 B: that's t- [mn] [lipsmack] 

598.33 599.89 B: that's true it just seems like
