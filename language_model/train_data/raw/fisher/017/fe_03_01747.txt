0.07 1.27 A: hello 

0.80 3.34 B: hi my name's dianne mm 

2.77 4.17 A: hi i'm gene 

3.93 10.54 B: [laughter] it's nice to meet you gene well this is a huge topic i [laughter] 

5.95 7.34 A: nice to meet you too 

8.80 15.28 A: yeah i'm not sure about their initial question but i have very good opinions on foreign relations and the whole bush administration [mn] [noise] [noise] 

14.94 16.60 B: well it's ah 

16.62 28.75 B: a huge topic because you know foreign relations are so important i mean with the world so small now you know or so to speak you know and and the chances of the war 

24.38 25.80 A: (( exactly [mn] )) 

29.00 33.66 B: increasing every day with all the terrorism you know it's ah 

33.76 35.68 B: (( really [lipsmack] )) 

36.01 46.38 B: difficult thing you know to deal with all these different countries especially the way even european countries not just the arab world looks at us it makes it very difficult 

39.58 41.15 A: [noise] it is 

44.55 52.29 A: but that is part of what concerns me so much right now about the current administration is i feel like he's alienated so much of the international community [noise] [mn] 

52.38 58.60 B: well and at the same time um i feel like after 

59.03 62.91 B: we actually went into iraq which is you know i had 

63.35 69.58 B: i wasn't totally against but i wasn't totally for i i think some of that has been 

66.59 67.63 A: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

69.69 79.96 B: um explained as far as why france and russia were so against us going in you know because there was support on their part that never should have been there 

75.65 76.69 A: yes 

79.63 80.88 A: mhm 

80.25 89.78 B: and it it makes me sad that the united nations can't be a more effective body than it is but 

89.38 90.59 A: that's true [mn] 

89.92 99.73 B: there there's just so much politics in it that [mn] it can't do the job that it was set up to do that's how i feel 

99.64 109.40 B: because countries are going to vote the way that benefits them not t- what benefits what is best for the world 

109.43 111.84 B: or the world economy [mn] 

110.96 114.98 A: true but that's the same way america centered in the whole situation [laughter] 

113.01 114.14 B: oh yes 

114.34 123.15 B: yes and and and that's what politics is [laughter] it turns me off big time a lot of times because of that you know 

117.90 119.54 A: yes exactly 

119.92 123.90 A: [laughter] exactly 

123.18 134.62 B: ah you know a politician votes for what's best for just his state or what's best for him to get voted in again not what's best for the country or the state as a whole 

129.75 130.69 A: mhm 

134.24 135.46 A: exactly 

134.51 141.36 B: and it's very frustrating and and that all carries over then into the foreign politics um 

141.39 147.78 A: but it particularly concerns me now because i feel like over the past decade international relations have been improving 

141.56 142.79 B: (( i [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

148.12 153.43 A: and with various coalitions for peace building in the middle east some of those are working much better 

153.75 158.34 A: um and then i feel like now with the current administration they're sort of 

159.65 162.80 A: alienating people who had become allies as a 

163.55 167.42 A: sort of essentially tearing down some progress that had been made [noise] [noise] 

167.60 178.04 B: i i think there had been progress made and yet at the same time i also feel that because of the building threat of international terrorism 

177.70 179.01 A: mhm 

178.46 179.65 B: that 

179.78 183.98 B: people were side stepping that issue to avoid 

184.09 196.24 B: you know to avoid confrontation and how long can you let that go after september eleventh you know that's where my ambiguity came in when president bush decided to go to war 

186.14 187.68 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

195.98 197.00 A: (( right [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

196.38 210.63 B: i i i wasn't totally for it but at the same time i felt that nothing would ever be accomplished diplomatically through foreign relations because those countries simply 

210.58 217.51 B: aren't truthful won't change won't you know won't follow the [mn] 

217.96 227.78 B: after the last gulf wars the sanctions that were put on them they were just going in a round about way getting around that now look at north korea you know [noise] obviously 

221.17 222.29 A: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

224.30 225.23 A: mhm 

226.21 231.34 A: [noise] oh that's yeah a terrifying situation that's building and been ignored to a certain extent 

228.35 229.26 B: yes 

230.59 243.62 B: well and i think it's being ignored at this point because how much more thin can we spread ourselves that's my feeling i think that had that cropped up before the whole iraqi thing 

238.70 239.71 A: mhm 

243.57 251.80 B: that much more pressure would have been put on north korea than is right now because you can't deal with too many 

249.24 250.20 A: right 

251.82 260.28 B: apples at the same time without emptying the apple cart you know it it is scary it really is scary um 

252.60 253.91 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

260.72 271.24 B: [lipsmack] [mn] there's no good answers i don't think and i'm i'm not going to s- just tear the bush administration down because it's not an easy thing for any administration 

262.79 263.76 A: no 

269.49 275.30 A: no it isn't and at least he is taking a stand which is a recognizable stand unusual for politicians 

271.93 273.00 B: yes 

274.67 285.58 B: yes very unusual and i do admire that but at the same time okay here's a here's another problem ah let's see they ask us to say who do we think the ah 

276.06 277.10 A: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

286.01 298.02 B: the ah countries are who are a threat right now um well what about syria they may not be a direct threat to us but because of our threats to them we're further alienating 

288.92 289.85 A: (( [noise] mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

298.14 305.91 B: the arab world and here we go again and is that going to increase terrorism rather than calm it down 

299.61 300.81 A: absolutely 

305.77 316.52 A: well it's actually a question of terrorism because it's terrorism has been around you know [noise] for [noise] for far more than decades but serious terrorism for well over a decade it's just that it finally hit america 

306.04 307.66 B: it's really 

312.32 313.34 B: yes 

315.17 318.23 B: it's finally hitting us exactly mhm 

318.05 318.91 A: um 

318.27 324.59 B: and and why were we not willing to do more earlier before it hit us you know 

324.08 325.14 A: right 

324.54 334.11 B: ah for instance supporting iraq in the iran iraq war we hardly have our hands clean in this whole mess so yeah ah [sigh] 

329.71 331.97 A: [laughter] yes 

334.20 341.15 B: i i do think that colin powell is doing quite a good job he's a very good diplomat 

338.90 344.92 A: i think he's doing an admirable job yes and and and he is very sensitive to the long term implications 

341.22 342.18 B: but 

344.26 347.25 B: yes i agree with that i think so too 

345.70 348.31 A: in a way i really respect him for 

348.44 358.27 B: so i think we have that going for us but i as far as what countries are particularly a threat to us i can't say that i feel 

358.15 372.29 B: other than a terrorist act that any are what you would really call a threat because no one can stand up to our military might so i'm not sure what they meant by that question you know what countries do you feel that are a threat to us 

371.66 379.99 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [mn] [noise] right but there's also it's the question of is it the country that's a threat or is there individuals within the country because that's part of the issue of terrorism 

372.58 373.66 B: other than 

377.16 379.51 B: yes that's more to the point 

379.69 381.52 B: yes exactly 

380.82 383.92 A: is it's not necessarily a national policy 

383.71 385.76 B: yes yes 

385.38 386.32 A: (( [noise] um [noise] )) 

385.81 399.97 B: and i mean even in iraq i mean it's it's going to be a mess for a long time because you have so many factions who have never had any freedom and now are all going to be fighting against each other rather than trying to unite 

391.74 392.63 A: yes 

399.66 400.68 A: (( right [noise] )) 

399.87 414.00 B: because of their different view points and religious view points [sigh] yeah oh i don't know when we'll ever get out of there but at the same time when you see so much that was uncovered of what 

414.25 423.46 B: the regime was like and how it terrorized everyone you know it it needed to be brought down and yet 

419.02 420.01 A: yes 

423.65 427.64 B: was that our responsibility to do that you know 

426.45 431.99 A: [noise] [mn] [mn] [mn] and that's what concerns me if we do it in iraq now what's next exactly [noise] [noise] [noise] 

429.43 439.50 B: then what who's next ahah i where does it stop if you can't do anything diplomatically and and that brings me back to the united nations 

439.55 446.73 B: they just can't seem to be effective in the role that they're supposed to play because of the politics of the whole thing 

446.40 447.60 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

446.97 450.95 B: so what's the answer i certainly don't know you know i 

451.06 460.47 B: i i really politics in general really discouraged me and made me angry at times and then when you say foreign policy its even 

455.33 456.36 A: yes 

458.13 458.73 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

460.96 475.61 B: more difficult of course because i mean even the european nations are looking at us now like big bullies you know and and and i don't that they necessarily didn't before they were just quieter about it 

462.74 463.84 A: mhm 

464.15 466.63 A: because there's so many extra issues they get 

469.16 470.55 A: [noise] [noise] yeah 

475.11 478.27 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] well right they didn't have such a concrete example 

475.70 476.71 B: but 

477.87 479.75 B: yes exactly 

480.45 481.95 B: so [sigh] 

480.50 484.33 A: [noise] [noise] but partly i feel like in america [noise] it also [noise] harkens back to our [noise] initial 

484.52 485.53 A: um 

485.56 492.89 A: [noise] our initial founding [noise] when we were you know debating whether we were going [noise] to be an isolationist or [noise] an international country [noise] [noise] 

491.41 496.16 B: yeah but see you can't be an isolationist country anymore that's im- 

495.12 502.18 A: [noise] no possible i don't think you can but that's where's i feel like we're currently heading towards since we're alienating so much [noise] of the international community [noise] [noise] 

497.09 498.05 B: yeah 

502.71 514.00 B: i i guess part of that will depend on what they actually found out that iraq had in the way of weapons of mass destruction or 

512.95 516.17 A: [noise] [noise] which so far has since surprisingly little [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

515.55 520.61 B: well and that's understandable also because the one um 

521.08 531.84 B: [lipsmack] guy that they just captured that was involved in the chemical weapons program i just heard yesterday had pointed out four sites where they worked on those and said that 

531.79 546.63 B: only one week before the war many of the sites and the chemicals were destroyed some were sent to syria some were buried so it's it's not like you're going to walk in and say oh here's the chemical laboratory it's not gonna be that easy 

537.15 538.63 A: (( ahah [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

539.85 540.85 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

545.59 548.33 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] right they've b- been hiding them [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

546.57 549.17 B: that part doesn't surprise me 

548.41 549.65 A: [noise] 

549.19 560.50 B: but it does keep the world looking at us as you know you said wanted to go in here because of the terrorists right and the chemical weapons threat now where is it you know 

550.59 551.92 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

559.77 561.33 A: (( [noise] exactly [noise] )) 

560.61 569.15 B: and that's part i think of what is alienating and like you said making us appear like an is- -lationist nation again so 

568.25 569.95 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

569.50 575.91 B: it it's ah it's just sad you know i just it it's like lately i 

576.03 581.33 B: have the news on a lot and yet i don't wanna watch it but i can't help but watch it [laughter] you 

579.51 580.34 A: [laughter] 

580.81 582.17 A: exactly 

581.29 593.18 B: know [laughter] and i it's i believe i hear ah ah a little one in the background at your house so if you have a small one at home i'm sure you're it particularly worried you know what are 

588.15 589.56 A: yes [laughter] 

592.02 594.34 A: [laughter] [noise] it does me very nervous 

593.49 599.06 B: kids going to grow up what kind of a world will it be you know [sigh] and 

596.54 597.92 A: [noise] yeah [noise] 

598.00 599.89 A: (( i have relatives who are fighting th ))
