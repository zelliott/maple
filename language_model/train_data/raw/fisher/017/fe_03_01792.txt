49.25 53.17 B: the kids with the computers get the as and and win the science fairs 

55.58 59.37 B: because of you know the pretty graphics and the typed reports and all that 

59.04 60.09 A: mhm 

63.38 66.53 B: um my youngest now is a

113.86 124.05 A: you know he'll come home and tell me different sites that they've worked on or that he's got to check his email and that he's got to check a dif you know you know check on a check on a site or whatever 

124.07 132.97 A: and it it fascinates me you know from when i was younger you know i'm twenty eight years old and you know from when i was younger and they didn't have them you know and as they slowly 

133.01 136.51 A: you know got the computers and everything and 

136.67 138.64 A: it's just amazing it is 

140.28 143.81 B: i would encourage you to [noise] ah 

144.02 147.60 B: keep that environment that you've created for your children because 

146.83 147.72 A: mhm 

147.79 148.83 B: um 

149.88 154.54 B: you know maybe i just realized that with the grey hair i have on my head but one of the 

153.39 154.20 A: [laughter] 

155.08 158.74 B: one of the best things you can do for your children is create environment 

158.72 159.83 A: yeah 

160.02 164.19 B: and to make the fact that they are computer literate and 

164.60 167.41 B: ah you know they don't think computers are a big deal 

167.68 168.82 A: exactly 

169.27 172.74 B: and that is such a gift to give to them because i mean 

172.82 180.87 B: the world now is is a world of computers just think what it's going to be like when they become ah adults in this world 

175.88 176.96 A: yes it is 

179.69 189.02 A: mhm one of my aunts that is um she's i guess she's like forty eight years old she wouldn't know the first thing about computers she wouldn't even know how to turn it on 

189.28 199.95 A: and she's just am she she herself at forty eight years old is amazed at you know what the computers can do and stuff because like she'll call me and she'll say 

200.22 201.38 A: she'll say 

201.88 207.07 A: well like the other day she needed an address for a hospital or something in a different state and i said 

206.92 218.90 A: oh i can look that up on the internet and she goes you can i said yeah and she's been calling me she says can you look on the computer for such and such information well yeah and she wouldn't know the first thing about it though 

219.10 220.82 A: it's kind of it's neat though 

221.11 224.99 B: and that's what that's the gift that you're giving to your children is that education 

223.58 224.70 A: mhm 

225.03 226.37 A: yep 

226.26 239.65 B: i can remember again when my seventeen year old daughter was like in the fifth grade and she was doing well maybe you're a social studies teacher but she had to do a report on bolivia 

239.49 240.44 A: mhm 

240.56 249.34 B: with you know gross national product and major imports and pol and population and all that and again she did it on um 

249.56 251.53 B: a computer presentation 

251.62 254.10 B: with pictures and ah 

254.17 261.57 B: movies and voice and she took it in to school and you know even the stereotype fifth grade boys 

257.72 258.60 A: mhm 

261.90 265.35 B: who couldn't care less about bolivia's major exports 

266.03 269.69 B: they were very interested they paid attention they even asked questions 

269.70 276.21 B: now these kids are getting hooked by by learning by the media that's being presented to them 

279.06 280.25 A: mhm 

287.08 289.76 B: i think the um the resources 

290.27 294.18 B: that these kids find out like you said 

295.02 296.28 B: um 

297.13 299.96 B: literally to be able to go and access ah 

301.54 306.08 B: information that even our largest library could never even begin to ah 

307.00 308.24 B: to contain 

307.91 309.24 A: mhm 

310.92 323.81 A: i know with me okay like i said i'm um twenty eight and when i was in school and stuff and they was just introducing the computers and stuff and i am just fascinated with the computers and 

324.03 329.29 A: you know i've boughten all kinds of games for my kids to use on the computers that they can learn 

329.39 337.35 A: that they can learn from that i can sit down and you know learn with them and teach them and computers just fascinate me they really do 

339.22 346.66 B: and something that something that i've learned and also read about is those games are 

345.76 346.63 A: (( uh huh )) 

347.63 349.72 B: those are really learning experiences 

349.17 350.38 A: yes they are 

350.79 354.37 B: i mean again you're kind of tricking these kids because 

354.54 357.08 B: i'm sure your kids they know what a mouse is 

357.18 360.91 B: they know where they they know what a disk drive is they know what a monitor is 

357.39 358.12 A: yep 

359.50 360.27 A: yep 

360.94 363.99 B: they don't know that they've been taking computer training while they've been playing 

364.66 365.83 A: exactly 

366.15 371.95 B: and another thing that happened with these computers that just is a tremendous asset is ah 

372.74 376.19 B: when my oldest son showed up for ah let's see 

376.38 379.84 B: he took typing as an as a sophomore in high school 

379.46 380.40 A: mhm 

381.06 383.06 B: and he could type ninety words a minute 

384.36 385.91 B: and you know where it came from 

385.85 386.61 A: (( hm )) 

386.59 388.55 B: playing computer games [laughter] 

387.94 389.13 A: that's cool 

389.10 392.45 B: 'cause he had not taking you know not one minute 

392.65 394.97 B: of um of typing training 

394.71 395.74 A: mhm 

395.44 397.43 B: and it all came from just um 

397.75 399.35 B: playing computer games 

399.50 403.63 A: that's cool i learned the old fashioned way typewriting classes in high school 

404.40 407.99 B: i still hunt and peck with two fingers now but i think my 

409.07 412.03 B: my experience on the computers have sped me up also 

411.74 412.87 A: mhm 

421.49 423.14 B: i think um 

425.97 430.30 B: i think it also more than just the automation experience and maybe even more than 

430.38 433.19 B: than accessing all the information on line 

432.92 433.88 A: mhm 

433.23 435.37 B: it trains their minds to be 

435.49 438.94 B: to be problem solving and technically orientated 

438.74 439.83 A: yes it does 

450.05 452.93 B: have you bought them laptops yet [laughter] 

452.22 462.85 A: no you know my son's friend um my oldest son he's eight he's got a friend that's like ten or eleven years old that's got a laptop and he brought and it's an older one 

463.18 469.35 A: and i brought he brought it over the other day and i said oh my god what is this and i couldn't get the hang of it 

469.54 470.77 A: and 

471.41 475.79 A: maybe if it was a newer one maybe so i don't know i just 

476.35 487.14 A: i think my son got more use out of it than i did and it was kinda odd you know my son's eight years old and soon to be nine in june and but he got more use out of it than i i'm 

487.18 497.91 A: more with a desk top i'm more familiar with all of it you know i'm not one for change or whatever but you know i've always found computers fascinated but that laptop that was a different challenge you know 

498.66 508.52 B: i've had the same experience i think the laptops because they're they have to be more compact there ah there are things heck i even have trouble turning one on 

503.47 504.63 A: mhm 

510.14 515.78 A: i'm not even sure i'm not even sure i think the the the ten year old had to do it for me 

510.29 511.28 B: (( you have to )) 

516.50 521.41 A: to turn it on you know and then i thought well where's the mouse and he showed me this little button and i said 

521.42 523.56 A: ew i don't like this you know [laughter] 

523.86 526.72 A: and it was just it was different 

526.94 532.62 B: and see once again this is something that i've learned just by being around that um 

533.12 543.24 B: this is more education that you've given to your children just just by ah giving them the environment being by allowing them to be around computers 

535.56 536.59 A: mhm 

544.26 550.90 B: you've educated just by having it be there in your house and you and letting them have the access to it 

544.50 545.62 A: exactly 

547.57 548.51 A: yep 

550.28 561.26 A: well i've had the computer probably about three years now um i've been a stay at home mom for about three years and i've had the computer the computer was bought for the kids 

561.17 566.39 A: um you know although mom's on it all the time but as far you know 

566.38 579.36 A: when i bought the you know yeah we got the computer for the kids you know and we bought the games and the educational stuff for the kids and it's like this computer's gonna teach them i mean my son's got learning problems in school 

579.38 592.64 A: and he's constantly you know wanting to play his games and he and he's learning from it you know he's really he's learning and he's picking it all up and it's going in his brain and i'm i'm really happy about the internet i really am 

592.72 594.61 A: internet and education 

594.89 599.89 B: yeah i found a long time ago there's a company in its headquartered some place in silicon
