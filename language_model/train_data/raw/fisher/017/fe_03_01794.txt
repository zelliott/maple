25.42 27.03 B: how 'bout yours 

26.36 30.99 A: um yes she is nine so yes she is in school uh huh do your schools have 

28.06 29.11 B: oh okay 

29.93 34.05 B: you know it's funny they ask about the computers in school 

34.24 37.39 B: i went to ah my ten year class reunion 

37.70 38.62 B: and 

38.39 49.22 B: talked to a couple of my old teachers and oh my gosh they just think that that is the downfall of education you know that teachers are gonna be replaced by computers and that they can't 

48.28 49.62 A: oh really 

49.23 57.96 B: oh yeah i was really surprised i mean these were a couple of science teachers you know and they just they couldn't imagine anything worse than 

58.40 61.75 B: computers in schools 'cause they thought that that was gonna 

62.04 63.00 B: you know 

63.03 65.92 B: take their jobs away i guess i don't really know 

65.56 70.78 A: [laughter] but if they don't learn how to use them at some point in time and don't actively use them 

70.87 75.36 A: then what do they do when they you know grow up because that's the world now [laughter] 

74.58 77.63 B: well you know what's funny um i'm 

77.50 90.57 B: pushing forty hard and when i was in school you know it wasn't even a thought we didn't have computers but one of the one of the best things that i did just kind of accidentally was learn to type i took typing one year 

84.04 84.97 A: right 

90.77 96.55 B: and i thank thank goodness every day because i sit on a computer every single day 

97.02 99.51 A: right right well you know 

98.31 100.00 B: and and you're right 

100.30 106.03 B: you know if they don't if they don't learn about computers in school they're gonna have to use them it doesn't matter what they do 

100.40 101.33 A: yeah because 

106.28 119.47 A: right and i i find that you know my daughter will come home with a project and you know we're my mother used to drag us off to the library and now i just say go look up look it up on the internet [laughter] it has the same amount of information [laughter] 

116.62 117.94 B: oh it's amazing 

119.00 128.76 B: yeah any question that comes up you know if there's some doubt about it it's like well let's just go see yeah it's a really really good information source you're right 

125.33 126.48 A: (( that's right )) 

128.56 134.49 A: right and it's a good it's a good way for them to learn how to use it for other things than to play games [laughter] 

133.45 137.19 B: yeah yeah mine mine use it for games a lot but you know 

137.26 145.36 B: they they have some games too that they accidentally learn something along the way you know they learn math or they may just learn where the letters are 

144.95 146.10 A: right 

147.02 147.86 B: so 

149.47 150.95 B: well 

150.34 156.89 A: [laughter] okay we have to go ten minutes on this huh um [laughter] yeah i guess 

151.65 153.11 B: [laughter] 

156.66 168.50 A: the only thing that i find a little a little difficult for my daughter sometimes and i know they they do practise in school but she'll come home with a a list of spelling words where part of her homework is looking definitions in the dictionary 

168.26 176.43 A: and i remember doing that in school and you then you had to know how to find the word and now we don't even own a dictionary so she just goes on the computer and types the word in there and it pops up 

176.32 183.82 A: so i was concerned about you know do you know how to look this up in the dictionary in case there's ever a day you have to do that [laughter] 

176.56 178.22 B: yeah 

182.97 187.67 B: well and you know something else i just thought about this 'cause we did this yesterday um 

187.49 201.10 B: one of my four children's teachers um uses the internet to post homework and spelling words and so kiddo comes home without his spelling words and he's like oh we'll just go to you know the are you there 

200.98 201.90 A: yes 

201.64 203.32 B: oh we had a beep 

203.28 204.08 A: oh 

204.01 207.62 B: he said we'll just go to teacher's web site and ah 

207.89 212.07 B: you know she'll have the spelling words posted there and i'm like oh what a great idea 

211.89 213.49 A: oh yeah 

213.07 220.32 B: so the teachers are using it to communicate with parents and you know with students and kinda help them out at home as well 

220.60 234.70 A: yeah i i think you know all in all you know there may be a couple of downfalls but all in all it's it's definitely you know easier and better for them than when we were in school and you know not having to to run to the library all the time to find out every little thing 

234.74 236.54 B: right right 

236.58 245.54 B: and then you know i can email my kids' teachers and instead of you know possibly having to call them when they're home with their families and 

244.91 246.06 A: yeah 

245.52 255.31 B: the email part of it is really convenient because nobody has to answer a phone right then or answer you know the call right then you can kind of do it at your own convenience 

255.02 258.84 A: right right i know 'cause it's a lot of times it's hard to get a hold of the teacher 

258.85 265.45 A: you know they have the students in class and then they have you know sometimes conferences after after school or meetings and 

265.18 266.68 B: oh exactly 

266.05 273.88 A: yeah so it's hard to get a hold of them but the internet's so much easier you just leave your message and they write back their answer and you don't have to worry about it 

273.85 276.88 B: yeah and you know the same thing with the school district or i 

276.76 279.78 B: assume most school districts have a web site now 

279.78 293.08 B: so that you can go and look at the school calendar you know if you don't happen to have a copy of it with you or handy or whatever you can just go and see what you know days off for spring break or you know what kind of things are going on at school as well 

292.94 298.82 A: right right yeah and i know our p._t._a. uses it also to you know keep in touch what's going on 

298.74 309.28 A: in the p._t._a. meetings and um you know they send out notices when there's gonna be meetings so that you know everybody can kinda feel like they know you know what's happening and stay informed 

309.23 316.56 B: yeah ours isn't using it that much for the parents' groups but that's a good idea that's something that we probably should do more of 

316.11 326.30 A: yeah 'cause then you know i know it's they send it out in the school letter but you know a lot of times those don't get home the kids forget to bring them home or you know you throw them in a drawer and [laughter] forget about them 

324.65 336.73 B: oh yeah [laughter] i have that tray right beside my desk where it's like mom i brought that paper home remember it's like oh yeah you did [laughter] if it's on my computer i have to look at it every day so it's a lot more 

332.11 334.46 A: [laughter] 

336.71 338.43 A: right right 

337.40 338.42 B: visible 

338.35 352.94 A: yes it is and i you know i just i've gotten to the point where i don't even you know write letters to people anymore i use the computer for everything and and my daughter does too now she she will stay in touch with a lot of friends that have moved away from her school which i think is great you know and one day 

351.89 353.10 B: oh yeah 

352.77 357.62 A: she'll grow up and be glad that she stayed in touch with some of these you know grade school friends that she's had 

357.69 369.53 B: and you know i have done the same thing i have moved away from the area um you know where i spent most of my life and i left a lot of friends behind and i wouldn't pick up the phone to call them and i wouldn't ah 

370.05 373.67 B: you know sit down and write a letter but i email these people all the time 

373.48 375.07 A: right right 

374.20 377.51 B: you know so you stay in touch with people that you've gotten away from 

377.45 380.33 A: right it's a good thing for them i think in that you know 

380.55 382.12 A: (( all the all the )) 

382.24 386.69 A: all the people who are saying it's wrong i don't think it's ever going to replace a teacher 'cause the computer can't 

386.54 398.44 A: can't explain something that you don't understand if you if you're not understanding the one way the computer states it the computer can't sit down and try and and explain it to you in another way so that you can understand like the teacher can 

398.51 408.80 B: well and you know not to replace teachers but certainly as an aide to teachers you know they have so many kids in a classroom that if you've got 

408.73 418.96 B: you know say twenty five per cent of your class is actually self motivated and able to self pace you know that is ideal for that kind of an individual that doesn't necessarily need the ah 

419.06 425.35 B: the teacher to say you know step one step two step three and and it kind of teaches them that initiative 

425.23 426.31 A: right 

426.19 438.44 B: that and then you take the teacher and she's got that many fewer little bodies to deal with so that those who need the the more attention you know she's able to give them more of her time individually as well 

438.47 443.66 A: right well i know my daught- you know my daughter complains she she's bored in school sometimes because 

443.47 457.36 A: you know she's one of the ones that catches on really easily and her teacher you know lets them use the computer and um do you know extra credit reports you know just for something to do while the other kids are you know trying to catch up to where she's at already you know so 

456.11 458.42 B: yeah exactly 

457.63 467.40 A: you know he doesn't have to worry about her scheduling library time or you know having to do it at home you know he just says okay pick a topic here and you know write a report on it and she can go right to the computer and start 

467.41 475.48 A: you know working on it and have something to keep her occupied instead of you know i think a lot of those kids that that get bored in school are the ones who you know start causing trouble [laughter] 

474.80 479.67 B: yeah unfortunately you're you're exactly right it's some of the really bright kids who 

479.67 493.85 B: are causing the trouble because they don't have as much to do and and you know that's what i'm saying you could have some kind of system and the computers would certainly help with that where those kids have above and beyond and i mean that's kind of a treat for the kids you know that 

493.86 497.97 B: they can go and do some work on the computer and do some extra stuff 

496.58 506.63 A: well and i think that they all like it you know they all enjoy using the computer and what they what they like to do they will you know they'll put more effort into it than anything they don't like to do [laughter] 

504.18 505.31 B: exactly 

506.17 515.93 B: you're gonna learn a lot more if you're enjoying the way that you're learning it you know blah blah blah from a teacher [laughter] like solid classes like that 

512.12 513.67 A: (( right )) 

514.49 517.76 A: right right [laughter] 

519.82 521.14 B: so where are you from 

521.33 523.69 A: i am located in colorado 

523.39 525.13 B: oh are you oh okay 

524.23 525.13 A: (( uh huh )) 

525.34 526.51 A: where are you from

529.33 530.99 A: illinois oh 

531.05 536.76 A: and now do your kids go to a public school or a private school a public school and they have computers 

533.82 535.87 B: yeah all four 

537.38 548.72 B: yeah some of them they do like my oldest is in um middle school he's in the eighth grade and they use computers um that are actually wireless internet it's really cool 

548.64 549.57 A: wow 

548.91 551.36 B: they they call it the airport 

551.57 566.32 B: and they have a bunch of laptops that they have actually bought um and there's only enough for one classroom to use at a time but they can access the internet they just take the little laptop to their desk and they can actually access the internet right there at their desk 

566.13 569.64 A: oh wow they have really updated equipment 

567.13 568.13 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

569.37 573.63 B: well it's one of the few things around this school district but ah 

572.81 574.44 A: [laughter] 

574.43 578.53 B: you know the school building's fifty years old but they have wireless laptops [laughter] 

579.47 594.44 B: but anyway that's and they've got enough filters of course built in that the kids won't get into anything they shouldn't be getting into and they all have to sign off on agreements saying you know i'm not going to do this and i'm not going to do that and you know 

593.68 599.89 A: right we have that too like 'cause and even the parents have to sign that that they allow their child to have access to the internet 

595.13 596.24 B: yeah
