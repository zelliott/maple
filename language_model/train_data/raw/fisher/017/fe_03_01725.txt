29.70 37.60 A: i feel that if the united states would mind their business and stay out of other people's business we wouldn't have the problems that we have you know we're 

35.71 37.00 B: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

37.65 44.48 A: at war now and we're going through what we go through now because the united states just can't stay out of other people's business

48.02 49.28 A: yeah 

48.49 50.64 B: i think they're a big threat 

50.39 51.65 A: definitely 

52.21 56.34 B: [mn] since they're on i- iraq's side though the you know the whole time and against us so

65.36 75.08 A: yeah i think we are i think that you know our guys have gone out there i mean definitely he had to be taken out of power because of uh what was going on out there but 

74.56 76.23 B: (( [noise] right )) 

75.29 77.09 A: i mean it 

77.33 80.71 A: yeah i mean i think it could have been handled a little differently 

80.82 82.05 A: but you know 

82.97 85.51 B: [noise] [noise] mhm [cough] yeah i don't i don't believe in war at all either so 

84.99 86.73 A: (( [noise] yeah ))

101.60 106.65 B: [noise] yeah [cough] how much longer you think we'll be over there for 

106.56 113.49 A: um i think it's definitely going to be at least a couple more months i'm not e- i'm not i'm not really sure you know 

109.75 112.43 B: a couple of months at least yeah 

113.17 114.25 B: yeah 

113.43 124.56 A: hopefully it won't go more than that hopefully it'll just be you know two three more months and our guys will get out of there and you know they'll try to rebuild that country or do whatever they're going to do over there 

120.00 120.85 B: mhm 

124.95 132.51 A: i just hope that it teaches the united states a lesson you know okay fine we got this done but we should really you know think a little more 

133.25 134.55 B: [noise] so this doesn't ha- 

133.46 136.30 A: before we do this again you know 

135.69 138.88 B: yeah plus the fact that's it's costing billions you know 

138.62 140.48 A: oh definitely 

139.49 141.93 B: the money that's cost us just to you know 

141.93 153.33 A: mhm and it will cost us billions because we decided to do it you know and it's the country who takes over who's gotta you know and things so [sigh] 

153.09 154.75 B: (( pay for them to now rebuild and [cough] )) 

157.04 170.34 A: hopefully you know it doesn't cost us too much more and hopefully after this is over like i said you know we won't have as many problems but i mean it's not even only them you know there's war in japan and and korea and you know 

167.63 169.30 B: (( yeah [noise] [sigh] [noise] [noise] right ))

173.60 175.03 B: oh yeah [noise] 

175.33 178.44 B: i think the biggest problem is i think every country's jealous of us 

178.41 179.68 A: oh yeah 

179.00 182.85 B: they're all jealous and they all want to be us and they can't you know 

181.20 182.38 A: mhm 

183.08 184.25 A: yeah 

183.79 190.23 B: we have everything and they don't have those countries that don't have anything [cough] that's why everybody wants to come over here too

196.52 198.44 B: than they have now yeah [noise] 

197.79 210.18 A: yeah they can fend for themselves and they can take care of themselves and hopefully after we help them they no longer believe that we're the enemy you know 'cause that's also another big thing that threatens our country 

205.79 207.55 B: right 

209.35 219.13 B: and one big thing is that i totally disagree with is i mean you can't obviously don't trust any of those civilians over there 'cause they're dressed up as people and they're part of the army shooting at us 

216.59 217.84 A: (( yeah )) 

218.94 220.03 A: yeah 

219.42 220.37 B: (( you know ))

225.19 226.60 A: mhm 

227.24 228.88 A: yeah 

229.92 230.63 A: (( it's ))
