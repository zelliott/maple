139.42 143.36 B: i don't know i kinda think all those countries over there i mean like 

144.40 146.00 B: afghanistan 

146.10 157.48 B: iraq iran all of them are to be feared i mean i mean actually who knows though because didn't they say that there's terrorists groups all through the world in many different countries so who is to know i mean which 

146.39 147.25 A: right 

157.67 162.87 B: countries to be afraid of actually i don't trust anybody except our government 

163.14 167.83 A: right and sometimes you know that's kinda funny too [laughter] 

166.61 173.10 B: i know but i think we're very blessed to live in this country anyway when you see the way it is over there my god 

172.87 176.94 A: yeah and another thing is it's like um 

177.00 183.56 A: well this is kind of off our topic but you know i watched um that interview with madonna 

183.24 184.39 B: mhm 

183.44 191.88 A: and um i don't know if you heard about her video that she was going to put out but it was supposedly very anti-american 

187.64 188.53 B: no 

191.76 203.37 A: and there was going to be like grenades and she's gonna you know like throw grenades and there was going to be dead iraqi babies all over the screen and i guess yeah and i guess she was basically 

198.94 200.71 B: (( that's a horrible thing )) 

203.94 208.97 A: trying to put her opinion out but still it's like you know 

208.91 213.96 A: why why would you do something like that it's one thing to say that you're against the war 

213.83 224.70 A: but my whole thing is you know since my husband's in military i you know i might not agree with what's going on but you know i'm going to support the troops you know i think that's the number one thing that they should do 

219.91 221.22 B: mhm 

224.69 232.83 A: and what i was going to say was at least we live in a country where they can do that and they won't get like killed you know like in other places you know 

230.59 231.76 B: that's right 

232.55 233.83 B: right 

233.25 239.92 A: at least we can voice our opinion and not be you know put in some kind of concentration camp or something like that 

239.82 240.89 B: right 

239.95 249.53 A: and it's like until until they you know the troops went over there there was so many things that i never knew that saddam hussein did like he had all of these 

249.61 257.13 A: prisons and he killed all these people and he used like chemical weapons on his own people and it's like what kind of person is this you know 

256.34 257.97 B: a sick person 

257.99 262.15 B: actually i'm afraid of china and i'm afraid of cu- cuba too because 

262.25 265.26 B: i mean look at over there who you just have um 

265.27 271.95 B: castro and that man is nuts i mean he's like a hitler over there so i guess i would have to say i'm afraid of cuba 

266.66 267.76 A: uh-huh 

272.28 283.20 A: yeah that's true i mean since i'm from what i've heard for a long time you know they've had problems with him and i think he's a nutso [laughter] 

279.41 280.62 B: oh yeah 

282.23 290.15 B: yeah i guess i don't know i mean right now i wouldn't even travel myself overseas to other countries i mean with everything so unsettled who knows 

288.86 294.13 A: oh no i'm lucky that i travel within the u._s. [laughter] on a plane you know 

293.77 295.10 B: yeah 

294.61 295.53 A: so 

296.09 304.74 B: oh i don't know i i guess i can't say i don't know what countries i fear but definitely cuba iraq iran afghanistan 

305.05 310.69 B: i mean has anybody heard from osama bin laden i mean is he still alive i mean where is he 

305.16 306.27 A: mhm 

309.48 312.81 A: i don't know and it's seems like after you know 

312.64 327.42 A: you know they they sent people over there and i really didn't hear anything you know they were bombing all the caves and didn't really hear anything after that and then of course this whole iraq thing started and i'm like well what's but what about afghanistan have they killed him or what [laughter] you know 

326.41 327.95 B: (( yeah i know )) 

328.09 329.27 B: and have they 

328.13 329.33 A: 'cause i mean 

329.45 343.33 B: have they found i mean weapons of mass destruction i mean over there now in iraq i mean so last i heard they hadn't found anything and that was the whole purpose i thought of having the war because they wouldn't reveal them have they found them 

342.32 343.39 A: right 

343.73 353.42 A: uh so so blah so far as i know i haven't heard anything but i did hear there was a guy that they nicknamed chemical i- ali i think his name was 

352.57 353.53 B: uh-huh 

353.33 364.11 A: and he was like one of saddam hussein's like top guys and he was like i told you about that that they basically wiped out i think it was the kurds 

357.16 358.21 B: mhm 

363.82 364.93 B: mhm 

364.18 370.93 A: that they wiped out like a whole village you i guess they were like testing the chemical weapons it's like 

369.86 370.95 B: oh my 

370.99 376.92 A: why would you use that on your own people i mean that's just amazing and then these people are still just like 

376.91 386.29 A: saddam hussein is the greatest thing ever you know and knowing that he did these things but anyway what i was going to say was that guy chemical ali they they found him he was dead 

386.30 390.30 A: so i was like well that's a good thing [laughter] you know i mean this guy 

389.41 390.78 B: oh yeah 

390.98 394.19 A: this guy's not going to be a threat any more but 

393.88 401.47 B: oh but my husband said now we've been over there and we've gotten rid of saddam hussein's government that now they want us out of there 

401.99 408.26 A: really i haven't i have i try not to watch the news too much 'cause i'm just like oh my god it is so depressing 

408.28 416.12 A: and but i mean in the best thing i think they came you know when they had all those p._o._w.s and they finally got some of them back and 

416.41 417.49 A: but i mean 

417.65 431.12 A: you know when they took over baghdad they you know the people were actually you know they took down that statue and the people were hitting his face with their boots and stuff and supposedly that was like the biggest insult over there that you could do 

419.84 421.06 B: mhm 

426.54 428.06 B: oh yeah 

431.21 434.24 A: and i mean but to me it's amazing 

434.52 443.96 A: did you see all of the pictures he has of himself all over the country i mean i'm like what a egomaniac this guy must think he's god you know 

438.33 439.30 B: yes 

443.88 453.32 B: does he have family like in other countries because in those countries then i would be very much afraid of too would think they would be a threat if he has family or relatives in other countries 

449.29 450.22 A: yeah 

453.51 456.50 A: i know and they were saying that they thought maybe 

456.64 465.97 A: i forget the name of the city but they thought maybe if he was still alive that that he would gone back to like where he was born i guess 

465.36 466.57 B: mhm 

465.95 470.73 A: but i so far as i've found out that they didn't find him there 

470.68 481.55 A: but they say that he could be dead but i don't know i really doubt it with all the underground stuff they have i i i don't it's just almost too good to be true if he died you know 

477.54 478.73 B: mhm 

480.99 486.95 B: mhm well what country wouldn't you go to what country wouldn't you go to right now definitely 

482.20 483.61 A: (( it seems like )) 

486.11 496.12 A: oh gosh probably france [laughter] probably i i i don't i don't really know 'cause i mean you know after september eleven i really wasn't 

488.74 489.86 B: okay 

496.29 504.39 A: scar- i was kind of scared to go on a plane because my mother had come to virginia to visit me and then she went back from here to florida 

504.58 516.40 A: and i was so scared because it was like two weeks after that and i was like oh my god please let her get there safely you know but i think now it seems to me a lot of people have forgotten about what happened with the world trade center 

507.45 508.54 B: (( hm )) 

515.62 517.16 B: (( mhm )) 

516.67 523.30 A: and you know they've forgotten about all the children that got killed in the planes and in in the actual towers and 

523.30 535.22 A: i think that's so sad i mean you've got you know all of those thousands of people that died you know and i think i would be afraid of any of those middle eastern countries because they're all crazy you know 

534.11 547.87 B: right any of those terrorists that were involved in nine one one whatever countries they were from so i would be afraid of those countries and i would think that they would be a threat because if they're training those people over there to sacrifice their lives 

542.54 543.65 A: yeah 

548.31 549.09 B: then 

548.49 549.61 A: (( and they've )) 

549.44 564.34 A: and then they've got and i and i definitely wouldn't want to go to israel either because those people are crazier you know they're they're killing themselves and you know they're you know and after they do those suicide bombings and supposedly hussein had paid their family like 

553.75 555.07 B: oh yeah 

564.30 567.73 A: all of this money because they're like heroes 

567.37 568.17 B: (( mhm )) 

568.01 574.10 A: you know and they've killed these people and they've killed themselves but they're heroes i don't i don't that doesn't make any sense you know 

574.00 581.92 B: so then do you realize there's not very many countries that we would feel safe going to that we would be feel that are safe period that aren't a threat to us 

580.63 581.63 A: right 

582.04 583.82 A: right that's true 

582.56 589.13 B: i don't know why does france why is france i mean why didn't they agree with um us the united states what was their reason 

589.34 599.89 A: i don't know i think they they thought it was probably you know not necessary but it's like you know i i my dad was like this is crazy they're start-
