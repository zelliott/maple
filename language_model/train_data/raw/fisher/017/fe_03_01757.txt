8.73 11.95 A: yeah i'm ah in oregon my name's amy 

11.64 17.44 B: okay can't say i've been to oregon but [laughter] there's a lot of places i haven't been [sigh] 

17.59 22.52 B: foreign relations i don't know that's a that's a mhm that's a hard topic mostly because 

23.48 30.93 B: well one of the problems with the united states is that you know we kind of feel like we need to go get involved and help a lot of other places that have problems 

30.94 38.43 B: which i think of course leads to them some of the countries resenting us which i think kind of is how we became 

38.46 52.63 B: they kind of look i think they sometimes they resent our involvement which of course sometimes makes us vulnerable to them wanting to attack us which is probably why you know september eleven that type of stuff is going on because they kind of resent the fact that we're coming over there and you know 

52.44 59.74 B: we think we are doing the right thing and some of the people there want us to be there but there's a big group of people who don't want us to be there 

59.54 60.41 A: yeah 

60.07 69.56 B: that's the problem it's like you know we're gonna help we're gonna straighten it out and they're like some of them are like who asked you guys come over here you know and there's some who really really want us there so 

69.75 73.22 B: i think that's one of the problems 

71.97 75.90 A: well what do you think is going on with france what's their problem 

75.35 78.79 B: i don't know i mean they are just like [mn] 

78.92 93.28 B: they are just like you know everyone is just like i mean i don't know i kind of thought the point of nato was you know everybody kind of being unified [laughter] but they're are like wait a second i don't want to do that so i don't know what they call themselves doing now but 

94.64 102.37 B: i don't know i mean i thought the whole point of it was for them to try to be you know united as far as what they were gonna do 

102.42 106.03 B: and now they're just kind of doing their own thing so 

106.47 111.57 B: i don't know i don't know like i said it definitely hasn't made them very popular here and ah 

111.73 119.16 B: everyone here is like ooh france change the name from everything french you know they are pretty much getting you know the cold shoulder so 

119.83 121.00 B: (( i don't know )) 

122.13 128.61 A: i i have to admit that i don't really feel threatened living in the united states 

124.39 131.15 B: (( yeah )) 

129.02 140.38 A: i really don't i don't feel like i'm in an immediate danger so i feel a little bit disconnected from everything that's going on in iraq and and um the war in general 

141.14 145.32 A: i don't really feel like anything's gonna happen to me i'm more worried that um 

145.61 148.67 A: you know mt hood is going to blow up or something 

148.75 152.19 B: it's it's the type of situation where [sigh] 

152.23 157.41 B: i mean if it happens it's gonna be something that's so completely random it's not like you know on a general basis like 

157.29 169.53 B: say like in world war two where people in london were like living in subways i mean i don't feel like that's something we need to be doing like this whole thing with the duct tape like i'm sorry if there is a chemical attack duct tape is not going to save me that's ridiculous [laughter] i mean 

169.32 182.47 B: if there's a chemical attack i'm going to die and that's just the way things are going to be so i mean and that's just like oh have like you know ah ah you know like a fallout shelter and have the food and stuff like that and i'm thinking 

173.10 173.97 A: duct 

182.36 191.71 B: it really isn't going to make any difference because it really is chemical warfare i don't really think it's really you know me having an extra couple of gallons of water is really gonna you know save me there i really don't 

191.48 193.96 A: what is duct tape supposed to do for you 

193.04 203.67 B: i'm supposed to duct tape my windows and stuff and the door and after it's closed you stuff towels under there and then throw duct tape so you are basically supposed to like seal yourself in so you know you don't get the chemicals and stuff 

203.47 204.69 A: oh okay 

204.19 218.54 B: but i mean there i mean of course you know so how long are you going to stay in your house i mean you know it's not like you have an unlimited supply of food there so i don't know what that's supposed to be but that's what they re- that's when they ran out of duct people and people like ran to the stores and buying duct tape like it was 

218.46 223.86 B: going out of style and all i mean so they i don't know they kind of make people 

224.45 228.02 B: the hype you know or if you see so- you know it it's 

228.76 232.92 B: i don't know it's kind of making some people panic i think personally 

233.27 237.29 B: i think that some people are really kind of panicked over the whole situation 

237.39 247.94 B: but you know on a day to day basis i don't really think you know i'm feeling like danger i mean if something happens it's gonna happen and pretty much not anything i can do about it so 

248.05 248.97 B: (( you know )) 

249.70 251.16 B: i mean i went 

251.42 253.15 B: i've been away i went 

253.07 265.92 B: i mean i travel i travel i just came back earlier this month from you know going away and in the united states so you know it wasn't a big deal it's more security that they have now which isn't a problem i mean i had to take my shoes off whatever whatever 

265.81 275.09 B: and i did i went out of the country in september and you know same thing i didn't feel like oh my god their the plane's gonna be blown up i just you know 

275.96 276.94 B: figure 

277.33 279.27 B: you have got to keep living so 

280.43 283.71 A: so this last vacation you took did you travel by plane 

283.40 291.18 B: plane both by plane mhm i'm not a road trip type of person actually [laughter] my limit's about five hours and i went to kentucky 

291.21 295.31 B: one of my friends from school lives down there so i went and stayed with her 

295.34 297.16 B: my first trip down there 

297.26 298.14 B: so 

297.71 299.84 A: and they had you take your shoes off 

299.59 309.40 B: yeah i had on shoes so they did have like a little bit of metal on them when i travelled so that might have been one of the reasons and then when i came back i was wearing sneakers and i didn't have to take them off 

309.26 321.58 B: but i know i had to take my shoes off when i was in the airport for mexico and i was wearing sneakers um when i left mex- when i was leaving was i leaving mexico when i was leaving mexico headed to houston i had to take off um 

309.27 310.12 A: oh 

321.39 328.03 B: i had to take off my sneakers and you know and they looked in there because you know you could lift up the thing i guess put drugs in or whatever or weapons but 

328.55 329.69 B: yeah 

329.89 337.72 B: and my brother said when he is travelling they made him take off his sneakers as well i understand you know shoes have some a lot of shoes have metal in them 

337.76 343.42 B: um so but sneakers i can't imagine why except for you know looking for drugs or whatever 

343.62 344.51 B: so 

343.82 346.88 A: do you do you think korea is a threat to us 

347.10 348.12 B: mhm 

348.78 350.51 B: i'm not sure i mean they 

351.09 360.37 B: they may have something you know going on over there i mean it's like as much as a reason of going to iraq we have just as much reason to be in korea north korea but we are not 

360.46 364.88 B: so i mean i wouldn't rule them out either i mean 

365.28 378.52 B: which kind of obviously puts us at you know well say the military at risk because every country that you know might be a threat then you know we are going to have a war with all those countries and obviously it's expensive and you know it's costly in terms of lives as well 

379.09 380.11 B: you know 

380.52 381.94 B: so it's 

382.36 387.51 B: it's it's this real difficult situation i mean i'm glad i'm not in politics 

387.31 388.53 A: [laughter] 

387.61 399.41 B: trying to figure out all these decisions um you know who should we you know who's a threat who's not a threat what should we do about the fact that they're a threat or they you know just don't like us and they are not going to do anything or do they have the ability to actually cause you know harm 

399.89 404.78 B: i mean because a you know a decent amount of you know people have died over there you know 

405.25 407.99 B: already it hasn't been that long it's 

408.13 412.92 B: been you know they started in march and it's like a you know a month and a half later it's almost may 

413.04 415.99 B: and there's been you know a decent amount of casualties 

415.92 423.09 A: yeah i think there has been more deaths in ah afghanistan and iraq than there were here with the world trade centre 

422.85 426.60 B: yeah i mean it's been a lot of you know a lot of people 

427.32 438.30 B: unfortunately and like you know some of them are like you know the suicide guy you know like i'm like you know the own the military guy who for some reason shot his whole group i'm like what what in the world's going on with that 

438.05 440.02 A: oh the guy with the grenades or whatever 

439.21 445.80 B: yeah i'm like what is that i mean [laughter] i'm not understanding the whole point of that one but it's you know 

446.26 449.04 A: the muslim you're talking about the muslim guy right 

448.45 453.70 B: no well there was the one guy it was the one u._s. guy who like basically he wound up like 

453.72 467.29 B: he had a grenade with his unit or something like that something really weird where he wound up killing americans and he was an american and then of course you know the guy oh we are going to surrender but we're not and then they wound up you know getting a bunch of americans so it's you know i don't know 

468.06 476.70 B: [sigh] i don't know i don't know what the what the solution is i i really really don't because there's i mean there's obviously all those countries that don't think like us you know commun- 

476.62 483.18 B: communist countries and things like that but you know what are what are they really gonna do about the fact that they don't see things the way we do 

484.33 485.22 B: (( so )) 

484.99 493.46 A: well yeah supposedly cuba was a threat to us and that's why we have an embargo against them and they haven't done anything to us you know 

489.53 491.06 B: and they haven't done anything 

493.25 499.15 B: nothing at all they're just down there living real bad not doing anything to the united states at all 

499.47 506.70 B: at all not that i would go visit cuba or anything since we don't have diplomatic ties with them but um a lot of people some people sneak well they go to 

506.61 521.29 B: canada in order to fly to cuba i know somebody who who did that for you know i'm like that's okay but there's enough vacation spots i'm gonna leave cuba off the list [laughter] i really wouldn't want to go some place where we don't even have diplomatic ties 

515.44 516.43 A: [laughter] 

521.38 524.77 B: that's a little scary that's definitely a little scary 

524.61 530.71 A: it's supposed to be a nice place to live if you don't mind you know being in a conservative place 

531.52 534.61 A: i've heard cuba's real nice but i 

534.78 535.83 A: (( don't know )) 

534.86 540.24 B: yeah i guess i'll i'll stick to the rest of carribean [laughter] [laughter] the rest of the places 

537.42 538.98 A: [laughter] 

540.27 547.37 A: i guess i'm you know i think that we are more of a threat to ourselves i think that you know 

547.60 552.75 A: a lot of ah these home grown hasty type guys are 

552.95 553.83 A: you know 

554.61 556.48 A: more of a threat to us 

556.77 558.59 A: local militias 

557.90 570.58 B: yeah we do have a lot of like pennsylvanians like they hate capital we've got a lot i mean i live in phi- i live outside outside of philadelphia but there's a lot of hate groups in pennsylvania you know there is a lot we have a real problem with that here 

570.57 580.92 B: you know you know the cities are like one thing but like there's like three big decent size cities and the rest of it is really kind of roll really kind of backwards you know um 

581.20 582.47 B: definitely 

583.32 588.08 B: definitely we had some real problems with that like you never see anything like that in the city but you know 

588.48 592.68 B: you hit the turnpike and you head out west you know philadelphia is like god knows 

593.08 595.31 B: it's not something i make a habit of doing 

595.49 596.71 B: not at all
