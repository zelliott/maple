39.69 46.83 A: but um a- a- the thing that worries me i just wonder how many countries we're going to get involved in over there 

47.29 50.91 B: ah yeah [laughter] yeah 

48.34 57.19 A: [laughter] right [laughter] right that it's uh it's kind of frightening but um [lipsmack] i know when i

77.53 83.01 A: and i'd be glad to see them all come back soon [laughter] and how 'bout you 

81.70 82.71 B: (( well )) 

83.02 83.81 B: uh 

83.12 83.74 A: (( [noise] y- )) 

84.12 89.01 B: i'm i'm actually amazed that they they are bringing some things back i mean uh 

88.82 90.38 A: (( yeah )) 

89.22 93.18 B: couple of the aircraft carriers and all of their planes uh 

90.99 92.06 A: right 

92.19 93.13 A: yes 

94.20 95.25 A: uh-huh 

94.21 99.01 B: [lipsmack] uh it just amazes me that you know [laughter] things went so well [laughter] 

98.08 105.82 A: oh i know yeah but you know really when you think about it they really didn't accomplish what they went over there for right 

105.83 115.43 A: they went over after saddam and they went ou- over after all the um [lipsmack] chemicals and so on that he had i i don't think they've really uh 

116.18 120.16 A: u- u- um been able to find that many do you 

120.32 124.46 B: [lipsmack] well not yet but i mean actually we're just using soldiers i mean uh 

124.89 127.05 B: [lipsmack] they say they have some training but 

126.92 127.89 A: yeah 

127.25 129.95 B: uh i don't think it's in 

130.62 131.55 B: uh 

132.66 135.87 B: specialized training in finding this stuff i mean uh 

135.50 136.58 A: yeah 

136.18 137.44 B: (( um )) 

138.04 141.30 B: [lipsmack] i think if i had ten twelve years to 

141.46 147.38 B: hide something and i had a big desert to do it in i could do it they they wouldn't find it [laughter] 

144.01 145.47 A: yeah right [laughter] 

145.79 151.54 A: right [laughter] hey that's a good way to look at it yeah uh-huh 

149.38 150.32 B: uh 

150.95 158.51 B: but supposedly uh just a couple of days ago they got some i i don't think this was an individual they wanted to catch but uh 

159.64 163.10 B: u- he apparently was in their scientific community and 

162.67 163.56 A: yeah 

163.15 164.74 B: he was saying that the 

165.73 168.27 B: they finally destroyed some of this stuff 

168.93 172.59 B: you know just a few days before our troops went into iraq 

172.29 173.39 A: yes 

172.83 173.98 B: (( and um )) 

176.56 187.03 B: [lipsmack] i mean i don't understand saddam hussein's rationale for not destroying it and documenting it and you know the whole doggone thing would have been done with 

186.77 188.02 A: yeah 

187.14 188.05 B: uh 

188.60 189.76 B: [lipsmack] but uh 

190.54 192.94 B: [sigh] i don't understand his 

193.68 195.33 B: thinking at all 

194.88 196.16 A: right 

195.44 205.85 B: but i have been in in the army once and was was in vietnam and i understand that people in different parts of the world just don't think the way we do 

198.63 200.08 A: oh okay 

205.58 207.70 A: right yeah yeah 

206.83 209.39 B: and uh i mean it's about anything 

209.09 211.52 A: exactly yeah 

211.12 212.29 B: so uh 

212.43 226.88 A: [cough] well i guess that's what floored me when i saw where the u._s. was supposed to go over and help find out the proper folks for offices and so on for iraq and i thought what are we doing there 

227.00 235.44 A: they don't want us to be handpicking who's going to run the country and who's going to do this they want their own folks that they wanna 

234.36 236.54 B: well that's true but uh 

236.21 237.21 A: yeah 

236.55 241.38 B: we do have some experience at this i mean you look at japan you look at germany 

239.90 240.93 A: yeah 

241.36 242.34 A: yeah 

241.75 243.58 B: uh you look at south korea 

243.31 244.29 A: yeah 

244.12 249.35 B: our military has done this before and you know we and we don't stay i mean 

246.33 247.64 A: yeah 

249.49 250.91 B: we stayed in europe 

251.64 253.97 B: because of the threat of russia 

253.76 254.71 A: yeah 

254.45 262.62 B: uh but europeans allowed us i mean it wasn't that they wanted us out because we for a p- part of their economy by then [lipsmack] 

257.54 258.61 A: yes 

259.45 260.36 A: yeah 

262.16 263.07 A: yeah

271.13 273.44 B: building an infrastructure not 

272.76 275.06 A: [mn] definitely yeah 

273.62 275.10 B: not in 

275.32 282.30 B: you know el- electing people we have very bad experiences in that uh because we put saddam hussein in there

288.66 289.77 B: [laughter] 

290.16 290.84 B: but 

296.04 300.74 B: but but i think i think it's necessary that you know six months maybe even a year 

296.23 297.00 A: (( do you )) 

302.01 303.24 A: that pe- a- that 

302.20 304.70 B: that it's going to take that long for us to get

307.29 308.31 A: yeah

310.20 311.13 A: yeah
