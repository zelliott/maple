280.98 281.91 A: mhm 

286.30 292.71 A: well yeah i'm sure they had i'm sure they get like indications of that kind of stuff all the time they just they probably didn't take it very seriously 

293.09 294.36 A: (( because ah )) 

294.44 297.46 A: you know they've had i guess 

297.85 298.78 A: um

307.39 308.54 B: (( yeah i mean )) 

307.98 314.87 A: now we are sort of more the intelligence the intelligence intelligence community is going to be more looking out for that kind of stuff 

314.57 317.46 B: yeah but to me i don't care you know what 

317.62 321.79 B: you know kind of chatter you get i'd check into everything to make sure

437.95 441.49 B: i mean is this the trying you know 

441.86 445.85 B: part of the relations coming into play with all that's happened 

446.04 447.69 B: you know it makes you think 

447.60 450.33 A: yeah yeah 

448.75 449.72 B: so 

450.11 451.05 B: ah

454.97 456.22 B: yeah 

455.55 461.38 A: kind of getting dinner together you kind of called at an inopportune time i guess but that's all right 

460.43 462.40 B: yeah well i 

462.42 466.76 B: put it at six o'clock because i have my daughter down she usually goes around six o'clock 

466.87 468.69 B: so it's quiet after then 

468.71 473.34 A: yeah yeah yeah usually i actually we eat dinner earlier than this but

475.78 476.99 A: no we don't 

476.90 481.38 B: no it's something to think about you know with everything going on

481.51 482.49 A: (( yeah y- mhm )) 

482.36 489.96 B: i never planned on having children because of i don't you know you're young- younger than i am but when we were kids 

490.00 494.18 B: there could be more kids than you- were you know i were growing up 

494.41 496.63 B: things were a lot you know simpler 

497.67 499.31 A: yeah they seemed that way 

499.73 502.69 B: you know with my generation 

503.06 510.56 B: the children could play outside they could go down the street walk by themselves and not really worry about someone trying to sell them drugs 

510.69 514.83 B: you know as they do now or somebody trying it was around 

510.90 512.49 A: mhm 

514.69 515.54 A: yeah 

515.37 519.77 B: and there wasn't so many latchkey kids like you know probably when you were growing up 

520.36 524.78 B: (( there were a lot of latchkey kids and and you know in this situation )) 

522.77 524.34 A: (( mhm )) 

525.22 526.13 B: so 

526.76 529.62 B: you know it's hard to keep a conversation going up for ten minutes 

530.32 537.32 A: yeah i know what you mean i'm running out of things to say but but it's kind of [noise] it's tough if you're raising kids 

532.89 533.90 B: yeah 

537.96 549.75 A: you know we want to have kids one day too and you worry about them more you know because you know you care you care more about them than yourself you know what happens to them 

548.96 553.72 B: oh yeah and i mean i'm not putting down parents today but 

550.79 552.49 A: you don't have control over it 

553.66 565.17 B: you know unfortunately you know even with two parent homes although these parents don't take time they put them in front of t._v. the playstation the computer 

565.30 567.45 B: and they have no family time with them 

567.86 571.18 B: and you know this is just from me observing 

570.36 572.87 A: mhm 

571.64 573.14 B: you know what i'm saying 

573.16 574.52 B: and they don't 

573.91 575.84 A: oh yeah 

575.00 576.94 B: i don't know it's just 

576.60 579.87 A: the t._v. is the new babysitter yeah 

578.09 584.74 B: yeah and it's like us we don't watch a lot of t._v. if we do it's like p._b._s. because we don't have cable 

585.15 589.93 B: so we watch educational stuff and i spend quality time with her instead of quantity 

589.69 591.72 A: yeah we we don't have cable either
