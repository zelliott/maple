91.94 94.38 A: by foreign travel to 

93.77 96.72 B: well not foreign travel but to certain places 

95.27 98.33 A: those those particular parts of the world 

97.77 99.99 B: yeah places that are mostly muslim 

100.14 107.20 B: i feel like not that i have anything against muslims in particular but i just feel like it's ah not a wise idea for a travel plan 

100.21 100.99 A: okay 

106.95 112.12 A: well i know that you know i work for a place that is of christian orientation 

112.63 118.65 A: and a few years back they took the kids over the kids to israel 

118.53 119.59 B: mhm 

118.99 122.87 A: and then last year there was supposed to be a trip but it got cancelled because of the 

123.12 125.05 A: political climate and 

125.47 128.56 A: you know i don't know when they'd think about [noise] going again 

125.63 126.82 B: i bet 

128.42 129.25 B: (( [mn] )) 

129.41 139.27 B: yeah i don't i think that if i was a parent ah for any kids that were thinking of travelling to israel that i would definitely make them think otherwise you know for a little while 

137.69 139.25 A: yeah 

139.18 146.84 B: well what countries do you feel um are ah are countries that are a threat directly to the u._s. 

145.89 150.71 A: well i i have to think that that we should be worried about south korea 

150.58 151.53 B: yeah 

151.59 153.23 A: [noise] 

152.75 155.34 B: yeah that's a big issue in north korea and south korea 

157.14 157.96 A: so 

157.76 159.72 B: yeah i know they 

159.17 163.36 A: i don't know if they are going to be if they are going to emerge as the next problem country or 

163.63 165.21 A: or whether it's all 

166.21 167.56 A: (( you know just talk )) 

167.86 172.72 B: yeah with the the nukes that the north koreans are developing and stuff 

172.17 175.18 A: well that that's what they are saying they are developing nukes 

173.62 174.59 B: yeah 

176.69 179.12 A: you know if if that's the case and they're 

179.91 183.61 A: you know not willing to use them responsibly or 

185.05 195.07 B: countries like that that just it makes me so um irate that that the local superpowers can't do anything about that like china and japan should be involved or russia or somebody 

195.01 200.85 A: well the thing is that they are not all of the superpowers or not all of the major countries have the same 

201.08 202.72 A: philosophy that we do 

202.85 203.86 B: that's true 

203.68 209.85 A: you know but but i happened to read just before we started this war with iraq a very nice article in the readers digest 

210.11 214.78 A: where they interviewed tony blair and tony blair explained why 

215.11 221.60 A: countries like the united states and great britain have to be concerned about negative activities in other countries 

220.97 223.16 B: mhm 

222.22 224.99 A: you know and he kind of he took the position that you 

225.77 227.98 A: know if if people are doing 

228.18 229.79 A: bad things 

230.43 233.00 A: then somebody really ought to stop them 

232.77 234.38 B: somebody has to step in 

234.34 235.83 A: yeah for the good of the hu- 

236.35 237.87 A: humanity if you will 

237.60 238.40 B: (( ahah )) 

239.10 244.93 A: i thought i thought that the way he re- he explained it was you know a lot more concise than a lot of the rhetoric we are hearing here 

239.18 240.59 B: that makes sense 

244.90 246.01 B: [laughter] 

246.42 251.23 B: yeah we are definitely hearing a lot of a lot of rhetoric and media play here 

251.30 259.29 B: i i thought it was so funny how quicksand had changed everything from um the the the war in iraq and everything to the new iraq 

259.31 265.79 B: they were pretty quick [laughter] to change that you know it it's it's a funny thing 

265.78 275.66 B: i i'd have to agree with you that um that i think that north korea and some of the remnants of these ah the old you know communist days are probably 

275.68 282.96 B: um pretty big threats ah as well as probably iran pretty soon and pakistan yeah 

280.62 281.51 A: yeah 

283.12 284.93 A: yeah they could gear up again 

284.86 285.71 B: (( yep )) 

286.14 288.09 B: that wouldn't be a good thing [laughter] 

287.31 288.21 A: (( uh-huh )) 

288.94 300.29 B: the it's not it's not all about as as much as people keep trying to make it out to be just a religious war thing it's definitely not that yeah exactly 

296.34 298.56 A: right or an economical war 

301.12 302.55 A: yeah i was 

302.94 310.37 A: yeah i i was i was on the fence about the war i was kind of leaning more pro action than than anti action 

310.05 310.89 B: uh-huh 

310.98 316.69 A: but the minute i began to see footage of people actually being grateful to our soldiers 

317.01 320.49 A: for coming in then i kind of said you know what i think this is okay 

320.58 323.83 B: yeah i felt the same way too i was very um 

323.75 337.48 B: very much thinking oh great here we go again you know trying to just force the stuff down everybody's throat all over and then when i saw that you know people were very very after a little while people were very open and honest and happy about it and i thought well 

337.82 344.01 B: you know it's about time maybe maybe they really do want saddam to go and you know they want something new 

343.75 347.26 A: well apparently he was a very evil sort of fellow 

347.00 348.66 B: yeah 

348.72 352.72 B: it's like they're they're local version of a of a little hitler or something 

352.10 353.01 A: yeah 

352.93 353.73 B: (( you know )) 

353.78 355.20 B: oh that's good 

355.49 358.29 B: i i heard in the news today that um 

358.76 367.81 B: um they're you know they're having a big pilgrimage down to down to some place um of the shiites that were flailing themselves and everything 

367.75 374.28 B: and they were thankful that they could go on a pilgrimage and clear themselves because saddam wouldn't let them 

371.88 373.29 A: (( yeah )) 

374.37 383.03 B: but then they were all saying death to america death to america [laughter] and i was saying wait a minute you wouldn't be able to do that if we hadn't just freed you 

382.73 386.01 A: well it's amazing what freedom does for people 

385.50 388.43 B: [laughter] that's true even over here 

389.08 394.40 A: people can express all kinds of points of view that aren't particularly 

394.64 401.08 A: you know pro american or pro society or pro constitution and they they have the right to say that as long as they are not 

401.16 406.23 A: you know real dangerous like you can't say fire in a crowded theatre but otherwise 

405.27 406.91 B: [laughter] 

406.38 409.13 A: you can say pretty much what you'd like to say 

408.80 411.72 B: everywhere else yeah that's true 

411.73 414.81 B: we have been we have been watching some pretty interesting um 

415.18 419.78 B: um you know ah demonstrations and stuff over here in in new york 

419.17 420.73 A: uh-huh yeah 

420.06 427.02 B: some of them that were that were sanctioned and some that weren't but pretty much all of them went off pretty well so 

427.21 438.74 B: i have some friends that were in the anti war demonstration and then a few friends that that were in the pro [laughter] one and the pro one was sanctioned and the anti one wasn't 

438.36 439.20 A: (( mhm )) 

438.92 442.79 B: but ah it pretty much was the same thing same kind of attendance you know 

442.01 443.19 A: mhm 

443.15 446.22 B: it just depends on what on what people's views are but 

446.29 455.58 B: other than that we don't have as much freedom as we used to i think here but i think that it's still ah better than what most countries have so 

454.97 459.76 A: i would imagine that you know you feel that more strongly where you are than where where i am 

459.55 461.23 B: mhm true 

461.06 462.59 A: (( you know because i )) 

462.67 463.70 B: that's true 

462.69 463.54 A: mean 

463.58 466.03 A: i haven't flown anywhere since nine eleven 

465.85 467.32 B: oh you haven't 

466.76 470.69 A: no it's not it's not necessarily even by choice as as 

470.05 471.45 B: just hasn't come up 

470.87 475.90 A: you know by opportunity because we are going on a cruise in june 

476.22 477.10 B: okay 

476.38 480.53 A: and we are yeah we do need to get to florida and pretty much planning on flying 

478.83 480.11 B: [laughter] 

480.17 481.86 B: yeah 

480.86 488.35 A: but um you know so i haven't i haven't really felt the effects of of nine eleven on airport security and and you know i haven't 

486.25 487.10 B: uh-huh 

488.97 493.69 A: i haven't really gone into the city all that much i i live right outside of philadelphia 

493.46 495.02 B: oh okay okay 

494.52 502.59 A: you know and i guess i guess the biggest thing that has happened in our area is that you know they have they have closed the liberty bell for for periods of time and 

503.62 507.10 A: they closed the street the front of independence mall and all that 

506.81 507.73 B: mhm 

507.11 512.77 A: and now because they have reopened the street they have closed independent hall so they can install more security procedures 

512.73 514.08 B: oh really 

513.62 515.31 A: (( but other than that you know it )) 

516.49 518.91 B: that's kind of isolated 

518.08 527.05 A: right after the war started i had to go out of the state and and there was talk of you know oh gee maybe there will be you know police on the bridges stopping people and maybe 

527.16 531.18 A: you know there will be this and that going on the only thing that i really noticed 

531.22 532.93 A: (( was that on the highway )) 

533.22 538.90 A: you know there were signs that said that the country was under an increased terror alert and to 

539.46 543.50 A: um report suspicious activity and there was an eight hundred number 

543.38 545.12 B: mhm 

545.57 547.48 B: i don't think i've seen that 

546.78 552.58 A: but other than that i've you know i've been pretty fortunate again you're you know you're kind of right in the middle of it 

552.03 554.17 B: uh yeah we've seen um 

553.97 562.14 B: national guard troops ah ah almost every day for the past month or two um and the all the subway stations 

561.89 562.69 A: (( ahah )) 

561.91 571.23 B: and some of them it's so funny there are there are women soldiers that are only like four feet five or four feet eight and and the guns that they are holding are a little bit longer than them 

570.24 571.28 A: yeah 

571.50 582.81 B: and ah i have seen them a lot of them you know with ah increased police protection everywhere and i was actually out in um jersey last weekend i went down to atlantic city and when we came back in 

581.15 582.00 A: okay 

582.79 590.82 B: the um holland tunnel they were stopping anything that looked like it had a big enough trunk or container just to look inside so 

587.83 588.79 A: sure 

590.86 594.03 B: it was you know you kind of see it and feel it all over the place 

594.11 596.76 B: it's not it's not a huge one feeling 

596.90 599.89 A: well yeah again i can imagine you are just so much clo-
