30.41 41.18 A: that's a good point yeah that could that could be a long um we might need more than ten minutes to go over the list of everybody that's a threat to the united states including themselves

43.14 45.60 A: and you see anybody else besides

52.99 58.78 B: i'm just deeply disturbed by u._s. foreign policy at the moment so no i wouldn't say i think 

59.01 65.47 B: um i'm starting to believe more and more that ah the threats are fabrications for 

65.62 66.96 A: oh okay 

66.48 68.38 B: um to some degree 

67.34 68.84 A: you'd be anti

76.60 77.71 A: (( um )) 

78.34 87.41 A: i i kind of follow the i don't really probably know enough about what's going on i kind of go both ways but i feel like there's probably more that 

85.04 86.02 B: mhm 

88.45 92.83 A: can go your way that we don't even know about and then there's 

92.90 94.77 A: some of it i support 

94.78 98.84 A: um i have a step brother that's ah serving in the military there so 

99.11 100.06 A: um 

101.09 102.56 A: i don't know i don't have a 

102.59 113.44 A: very strong opinion either way so but i i did vote for president bush [laughter] you have to promise not to hang up on me you have to promise not to hang up on me

127.26 128.39 B: (( it's just that no )) 

128.64 130.28 B: actually no 

130.31 137.77 A: well i have a lot of friends that don't even vote so i think it's a step in the right direction to have um 

133.57 134.65 B: yeah 

138.52 140.69 A: to have voted at all so 

140.19 146.38 B: yeah yeah absolutely i think you're right i i think i guess what's sad to me is um 

147.45 154.11 B: that most of the people in the military are a lot a good number of the people in the military at least from what i've been reading 

154.18 159.58 B: um are working class or often go into the military because um 

159.92 162.03 B: they're looking for an education 

162.14 168.97 A: oh yes mhm i don't know very many people in the military but anybody i can think of they um 

163.91 165.15 B: (( and they normally go )) 

169.20 172.64 A: that's why they they either went in to pay off their um 

172.97 175.63 A: student loans or were 

173.82 174.69 B: right 

175.89 181.05 A: dropping out of school because they didn't know anyone that they wanted to do and just kind of ended up there 

182.03 185.42 A: i don't really know anyone who wanted to make it a career 

185.02 186.34 B: right and then 

185.72 186.91 A: from the gecko 

186.68 193.60 B: basically i just learn now only one senator of the entire u._s. congress only one senator has someone in the military 

194.32 202.05 A: oh i remember hearing that yes that they would be voting differently if it was their children who were um 

196.48 197.36 B: yeah 

203.29 204.26 A: serving 

204.22 205.58 B: yeah 

206.00 207.03 B: (( then )) 

207.70 213.19 B: ah what else was it oh yeah they have a new budget that they are trying to pass 

213.20 217.35 B: through congress it's the ah president bush's budget cuts 

217.60 221.84 B: actually cuts a lot of support monetary support for veterans 

222.26 227.20 B: and i just think that's immoral to send people off to die and not take care of them afterwards [laughter] 

227.00 229.07 A: (( [noise] excuse me )) 

229.39 232.69 A: i agree i i grew up in a town where there was 

232.66 240.37 A: it was the main presence in the town was the navy base you know those i mean they moved them every four years and 

236.13 236.94 B: (( oh )) 

240.33 248.69 A: the kids i were going to was going to school with they were all unsettled just the that's not their parents but that affected their whole family 

249.02 249.75 A: (( they were )) 

249.83 253.75 A: constantly having to um pick up and move and 

253.89 258.53 A: everything i get a lot of stuff in the mail from the ah from the disabled veterans and the um 

258.76 261.00 A: (( paralysed veterans and )) 

261.10 265.16 A: everything so yeah i i agree they should do as much as they can to 

265.24 266.10 A: um 

266.17 267.95 A: continue to support them 

267.94 273.12 B: do you think that most of them are supporting the war because they actually thought we should go to war or because 

273.18 276.23 B: they felt an allegiance to as soldiers 

277.59 278.15 A: (( um )) 

278.34 279.73 A: probably 

280.22 282.28 A: i'd go i'd say a lot of people 

282.71 291.88 A: because of the soldiers of course if you know if you have anyone in the military or if you know anyone who knows someone you know if you have any kind of um 

292.09 294.83 A: vague association with it of course you feel 

295.31 303.75 A: you don't want to offend them and then some people really do um have a very strong um belief that we should have done it so 

303.81 305.71 A: i'm probably more on the um 

305.90 308.30 A: wanting to support the military side 

307.74 308.89 B: mhm 

308.52 309.45 A: than 

309.06 311.01 B: what what are your main reasons 

311.65 312.66 A: um 

314.65 322.59 A: i don't really know enough about it to i don't have a big reason to think that we should have done it but i i do like to support the ah the military when 

322.65 328.39 A: the the decision has been made and it seemed pretty inevitable that it was going to happen so 

329.41 330.32 A: um 

331.06 335.41 A: i'm not one that was going to go down and be involved in a protest or anything 

335.19 336.12 B: mhm 

335.79 336.35 A: (( so )) 

336.85 343.44 A: there really wasn't much i live are we allowed to say where we live i don't know i live near atlanta and there wasn't 

343.50 350.51 A: i live in a small town near there and i didn't there was nothing here like you wouldn't have known the war was going on 

350.03 350.95 B: wow 

350.73 352.67 A: it was amazing [laughter] 

352.48 353.31 B: (( oh )) 

352.87 359.04 A: and we drove up just like forty five minutes north um and there were 

359.13 365.79 A: yellow ribbons everywhere it's i i think it's very local depending on what population is there 

363.28 364.14 B: yeah 

365.58 368.99 B: yeah it was pretty i live um in philadelphia and ah 

369.45 370.99 B: before the war i 

371.28 371.91 B: (( i )) 

372.00 375.33 B: had never seen such protest actually huge protest 

374.68 376.27 A: really 

375.69 384.93 B: yeah i was in new york for the i think it was the march fifteen it was the day where like a million people marched in rome against the war a million people in london where the whole world 

384.19 387.21 A: (( yeah i remember new york seeing that ahah )) 

386.71 396.36 B: and then um and i was in new york and it was it was enormous i thought that day there's no way we will go to war at least i mean not unilaterally 

396.54 397.84 B: after today 

398.69 400.38 B: but it was remar- 

399.55 408.80 A: yeah there was a great um i listen to m._p._r. and they do they do a pretty good job of covering the protests and the of course the the 

409.00 421.09 A: people in for for and against and they every day it said there was you know they were talking about the different protests around the world everywhere people everywhere were protesting so 

417.91 419.75 B: (( yeah that's pretty remarkable )) 

421.40 428.62 A: but i don't know it's it's very complicated because you start um you listen to c._n._n. and then you listen to um 

429.78 434.90 A: all the different news channels and there's something different on [noise] every station 

434.45 439.94 B: mhm it's true there is so much stuff to sort through it's hard to tell what's wrong and what's real 

439.25 446.78 A: i get very confused [laughter] i have two little children so i don't get a lot of time to read the paper or to 

446.88 449.79 A: um sift through the 

449.91 452.79 A: the the information it's very confusing 

452.21 453.25 B: mhm 

453.25 462.11 A: i am not the most informed um but i do make an effort to get the head you know get the the headlines so i know that there's more that i'm missing so 

461.35 463.92 B: yeah well the m._p._r. i think is pretty good 

463.81 465.79 A: i enjoy i try to um 

466.78 469.79 A: (( shut my kids up [laughter] so i can listen to )) 

467.91 469.93 B: [laughter] 

471.21 474.33 A: because they they go more in depth you know than just ah 

474.72 477.51 A: logged on to regular radio stations 

477.43 480.33 B: yeah that's what i like about it it's really hard to um 

480.66 481.93 B: find anything that's 

482.18 485.18 B: that goes a little bit below the surface of things 

484.21 488.66 A: mhm did did you actually go to you went to the protest 

487.96 490.85 B: oh i went to lots of protests [laughter] 

489.63 495.05 A: well great that's good that's good i don't i don't know anybody that is that um 

495.77 505.53 A: really has an opinion so all the people that i know they don't even care one way or the other you know so that's nice that you you have 

502.06 503.05 B: (( well )) 

504.74 508.74 B: yeah i i did i was doing a lot of reading and um 

509.55 513.26 B: background reading and the more i read about it the more i thought like 

513.61 514.32 B: (( um )) 

515.06 518.84 B: our emotions after september eleventh were being manipulated 

518.86 521.14 A: oh sure yes 

520.85 524.51 B: because a lot of the people who are serving in um 

524.58 525.76 B: in the current 

525.99 529.26 B: presidential cabinet served under bush senior 

528.99 531.08 A: mhm mhm

557.71 564.30 B: they talked about how after the failures of the first war wolfowitz rumsfeld and cheney wrote 

565.24 570.44 B: i forget the document um i forget the exact name of it um but it was 

571.07 574.10 B: something like the doctrine for the new american 

574.13 576.01 B: century or something like that 

576.14 589.24 B: and and it talked about and this was like nineteen ninety six or something or ninety four and it talked about how in the new millennium we were going to need the ah the u._s. the u._s. was going to 

576.24 577.39 A: oh wow
