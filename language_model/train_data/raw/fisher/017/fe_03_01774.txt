0.37 2.51 A: joe from philadelphia 

0.46 1.64 B: hi 

2.63 4.72 B: hi this is sherry from seattle 

4.41 5.71 A: (( hi how are you doing )) 

5.19 6.51 B: okay 

6.16 9.67 A: good does our time start yet 

9.81 11.66 B: i guess so 

12.73 14.30 A: (( i guess they haven't )) 

13.53 15.67 B: i guess with the ah beep 

14.76 17.99 A: they haven't come back on and say otherwise 

17.79 22.48 B: yeah ca- you know what can you repeat the question i didn't hear the last is 

22.04 33.21 A: yes it was actually ah the topic was do you consider what country what other country do you consider other than iraq are a threat to the united states are a threat to the united states at this point the 

31.53 33.71 B: oh oh okay 

34.59 37.14 A: first thing that came to my mind was syria 

37.12 38.12 B: ah 

37.98 39.99 A: because we're kind of ah 

40.23 41.86 A: teetering on ah 

43.01 46.45 A: going after them next kind of as a 

46.83 53.02 A: neighbor to iraq but i guess what other country and i guess the middle east or i guess across the world 

53.06 54.53 A: what would you consider 

55.02 56.75 A: the next possible threat 

56.82 61.60 B: well you know syria is in the news but you know what offhand i don't 

61.62 71.79 B: really feel the threat from another country here i mean it's hard for me to imagine another country being able to do what we just did in iraq you know and 

71.22 72.33 A: (( mhm right right mhm )) 

71.74 83.15 B: bring a bunch of a huge military a huge amount of arms and stuff and yeah and maybe there's countries that could send their terrorists over and we could have another world trade centre or something but 

76.21 77.00 A: right 

83.35 90.51 B: i i just don't see it you know i think the middle east is too divided up and i don't know i mean maybe 

90.17 91.46 A: i mean it's 

90.63 93.47 B: i'd i'd have to be educated a lot more on 

93.59 102.80 B: what i mean even north korea i mean you know say they do have a bomb or whatever i just ha- see i'm having a hard time getting it over here and 

98.72 99.50 A: right 

102.56 103.67 A: right 

103.05 105.89 B: and maybe i'm naive but but you know 

104.68 116.38 A: yeah it's definitely definitely an interesting subject because i think ah people are divided in the united states as far as ah whether or not we should even be involved with a war such as that 

107.73 108.72 B: uh-huh 

109.94 110.97 B: mhm 

115.81 117.01 B: mhm 

116.43 128.11 A: and you know call it a threat i think from a conventional warfare standpoint you're right you know there is no other country in the world that could could attack the united states the way we we 

128.04 131.84 A: insert ourselves in- into a country and basically just take over 

131.48 132.55 B: mhm 

131.88 135.14 A: and obviously another country in the world i mean other than 

135.23 141.70 A: you know possibly the soviet union ah being i guess the second super power to the united states 

141.49 142.70 B: mhm 

142.25 146.79 A: but i mean i think we we we truly are one of the lone 

146.78 157.26 A: supervi- or [mn] superpowers left in the world and i think just by being that i think we we are more of a threat to other nations than they are to us 

150.14 151.24 B: mhm 

157.13 160.79 B: (( mhm [mn] ah i totally agree with that [laughter] )) 

160.07 161.37 A: yeah 

160.88 162.35 B: (( yeah )) 

161.62 170.74 A: yeah i mean it's a it's a tough call because i mean we we did suffer the biggest ah terrorist attack in history um 

170.60 173.18 A: on our soil which is kind of um 

173.00 183.94 A: you know something that's never happened here and americans have a tough time dealing with it as far as other countries that could possibly pull something like that off i mean i guess the only other 

183.77 189.97 A: threat that that that i would liken that to would be a country that would have the ability to 

190.11 191.86 A: have a nuclear weapon 

191.67 205.68 A: and be able to deploy it and launch it and or you know one of those dirty bombs type ah weapons that can be smuggled into the united states and kind of planted in a in a big public venue type thing 

197.25 198.28 B: mhm 

204.32 205.38 B: mhm 

205.91 212.40 A: because i think i think those just the weapons of mass destruction that are that are available to these countries um 

212.88 215.73 A: pose more of a threat than the country itself 

215.60 224.22 B: right that that is more of a frightening concept to me to just to have them to any country that they have their um 

218.86 219.67 A: right 

224.59 231.02 B: the biological or the chemical stuff where it's it's scary i mean i don't even know what they can do but 

230.51 231.47 A: right 

230.85 240.20 B: it's just that something like that i can almost imagine wiping out not the wh- whole of the united states but a lot of people you know a lot of people 

236.83 238.17 A: (( right right )) 

238.24 241.02 A: but causing a lot of destruction and a lot of 

241.13 243.29 A: um death and 

242.48 243.44 B: (( yes )) 

244.17 250.20 B: i don't know the thing is that scares me is that i [laughter] think we're making a lot of people mad at us and that 

249.39 250.84 A: oh absolutely mhm 

250.22 259.05 B: and other countries have dealt with terrorism and i don't know i'm not really afraid in seattle i think yes something could happen again 

258.97 272.69 B: but what's the chances of me being there and if it does it it's i mean it's happening around the world and that doesn't make it right but it's part of other countries' reality and that's um [mn] 

267.60 268.61 A: right 

272.02 284.39 A: right right i mean yeah it's definitely got a point i think i think people um bring it into their own personal situation and say you know how how am i threatened and um 

283.27 284.37 B: mhm 

284.43 288.32 A: i guess i guess where i live in proximity to new york 

287.99 289.03 B: mhm 

288.42 290.17 A: closer than than ah 

290.14 297.68 A: seattle i think ah just in proximity you know itself philadelphia being closer to new york in fact we knew 

295.96 296.99 B: mhm 

297.49 306.32 A: people that were in the world trade centre and we actually you know i actually work for a big financial institution that had a lot of clients that were 

299.05 300.12 B: (( oh )) 

306.37 310.80 A: ah located in the world trade centre so we actually knew some people who lost their lives 

310.18 311.33 B: mhm 

311.21 320.87 A: and things like that so it kind of hit more closely to home um more so than i think people that are not as close in location i guess mhm 

314.46 315.54 B: mhm 

320.13 330.74 B: yeah and you know it it did you know to me it did hit close to home in the sense that if i had been say working in a building downtown s- or seattle 

330.59 335.38 B: i may have thought oh gosh that would have been scary going to work in the days following 

335.00 335.94 A: right 

335.31 344.04 B: and i mean i know it impacted people's lives there and i mean it did impact mine but i just think that a lot of planning went into that 

343.48 344.77 A: (( right mhm )) 

343.93 354.58 B: and really to me if we had just been doing a better job of supporting the c._i._a. and the f._b._i. if they'd been working better i think good chance they would have caught that 

353.93 359.20 A: ah absolutely and i think that that that's really what what's going ah to 

355.19 356.79 B: (( you know so )) 

359.41 364.16 A: assist us in identifying these other countries that are possible threats 

362.13 363.12 B: mhm 

363.82 369.43 B: mhm but i don't think it helps it when our government comes out with you know buy duct tape or 

364.25 365.20 A: (( i think )) 

369.51 370.79 A: (( all right right )) 

369.63 384.30 B: i don't know the guy that does the homeland security bit when he was talking about you know how to prepare your your house and that you know that's the same stuff a lot of what he was saying basically was the same stuff you should do already in case of an earthquake 

375.86 376.94 A: (( right yeah )) 

382.13 382.95 A: right 

384.08 392.25 B: you know or a fire and he could have just said that you know look you should have this you make you know for any you know 

387.40 388.21 A: right 

390.01 390.78 A: right 

391.31 392.06 A: right 

392.13 401.90 B: natural disaster but instead it's to me it's a fear tactic and it's really too bad because there's a lot of people that are very frightened and 

402.12 404.20 B: i i don't think we need 

404.41 407.51 B: to change our lifestyle right now 

406.60 417.57 A: yeah i i think in some ways it's it's politically positioned to where they use that scare tactic to manipulate your opinions with other countries also 

417.12 418.50 B: mhm 

417.77 426.74 A: you know and bringing it as close to home as possible meaning you know you can you need to go to home depot and buy duct tape basically brings it right into your own house 

426.56 435.04 A: and then they follow that up with you know there are countries out there that have these biological weapons and they start naming them so they now become the enemy to you 

426.65 427.62 B: mhm 

434.40 435.50 B: mhm 

435.39 447.08 A: so i think it works in conjunction i think it's politically based at you know to a point but then again you're right i mean i think if if we if we support our government enough to say 

446.97 458.86 A: you know we support what the f._b._i. is doing we support what the c._i._a. is doing we we know that they have these known terrorists under surveillance and we we can pretty much deal with them on a case by case basis 

458.92 464.65 A: and not deploy an entire army into a nation and basically take over 

461.67 462.74 B: (( right )) 

464.82 466.27 A: i think that's 

466.10 479.97 A: kind of the wa- i think i think that's the way i i look at it more so than than going in and saying okay syria's next so we go in and take over that country i don't know i don't i don't agree with that i think it's more we know who the terrorists are we know 

473.21 474.64 B: (( mhm yeah could you imagine )) 

476.16 477.27 B: mhm 

480.14 493.65 A: you know where they're being um protected and we know who's protecting them so go after those particular people and go after those particular organizations which i think we're doing to a point but i think um 

485.80 486.85 B: mhm 

490.28 490.91 B: (( mm )) 

493.97 498.57 A: i think also we've we've kind of overstepped our bounds so to speak 

497.31 498.87 B: mhm 

498.61 501.81 A: you know um really going into a country that 

502.01 503.35 A: really i mean 

503.50 509.93 A: and and and it's tough to say it because i really do support our troops and and i really wanted to yeah i really want 

507.38 508.45 B: i do too 

509.97 519.48 A: want want them to be safe but it it almost comes down to the fact that we almost have to find chemical weapons and or 

519.53 524.64 A: see them used in battle to actually save face with the rest of the world 

524.69 533.64 A: because our whole argument from day one was that iraq had weapons of mass destruction and we have yet to see one see one materialize 

531.56 532.69 B: i know 

533.46 545.18 A: so unless we do a good job of either planting the weapons there [laughter] to make it look as as if we you know found them there or we legitimately have them used against us in battle 

537.78 538.85 B: mhm 

545.03 557.69 A: is really the only way that that the united states is really going to able to truly say that that we had all of our facts straight before we went into the country and took over and and and it's tough it's tough because 

555.03 555.97 B: mhm 

557.62 570.10 A: as the days go on it's you know day after day you're kinda waiting for that news to come back and say did we find them yet did we find them yet and why that's why we're there you know we were sent over there to 

570.29 574.88 A: find these weapons and and you're not finding them yet so i need to see something you know 

572.94 574.04 B: mhm 

574.86 577.51 B: i know it's like the whole world is watching 

577.23 578.44 A: exactly 

577.75 578.59 B: (( yes )) 

578.72 579.87 A: exactly 

579.17 584.62 B: and most of the rest of the world doesn't trust us i mean people in the middle east and 

584.13 585.58 A: (( absolutely yeah )) 

584.63 587.59 B: turkey and why would they really i mean 

586.54 587.72 A: (( yeah right )) 

587.83 599.89 B: and it is i mean it's shown throughout history that you know we go in and do things in countries that aren't the greatest things and we don't they don't come out until much later like my parents' generation they can't figure out they know that
