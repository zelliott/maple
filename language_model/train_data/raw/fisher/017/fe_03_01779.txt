0.03 1.14 A: hello 

0.78 1.86 B: hi 

1.85 2.92 A: hi how are you 

2.62 3.86 B: i'm good how are you 

3.76 5.52 A: (( not bad not bad at all )) 

5.10 7.98 B: mhm um my name is anne 

5.55 6.48 A: daryl 

7.70 10.32 A: okay nice to meet you 

8.75 9.81 B: mhm 

9.88 11.48 B: yeah nice to meet you too 

11.15 18.43 A: okay now the topic i didn't quite get the topic because i had the speaker phone on and as i ran over here and got the phone when i heard the topic 

17.19 31.95 B: okay um the topic is um education and computers are they helping or hurting so i would say that they do a little bit of both because i've been reading some articles about how some kids um 

31.99 35.87 B: go into the computer and they're able to get like um 

36.07 39.04 B: the test or exams that they're having 

38.66 39.71 A: mhm 

39.20 47.78 B: and then they pass it on to other students and the parents don't really intervene one way or the other unless the students are caught and then 

46.91 59.28 A: yeah i wonder because see i haven't read too much of ah anything in this area i mean my opinion opinions would be pretty much just that it's not going to be anything that's ah based on ah 

49.61 51.03 B: mhm 

52.26 53.40 B: mhm 

59.40 64.32 A: anything factual that i've read you know studies or anything of that sort but um 

60.81 61.69 B: mhm 

63.43 64.13 B: mhm 

64.84 70.14 A: yeah i mean how are they able to do that how are they able to go in and actually ascertain that kind of info 

69.15 71.48 B: (( um they have um )) 

71.87 74.62 B: um code words or 

74.81 87.11 B: um you know if if they're in the click then you know they've done quite a bit of research and especially if they are like you know hackers they know everything about the computers and stuff so you know they're able to like um 

82.47 84.44 A: mhm mhm 

87.81 99.34 B: if they don't find the exact thing that you know they're being tested on they can find something sim- pretty similar to it and then they just pass it along to their friends and stuff and and they have the heads up on on the other kids that don't 

93.35 94.21 A: mhm 

99.47 109.68 B: so i would say that um computers are helpful in a um a lot of ways but then they are hurting the kids in in some other ways you know especially 

108.21 119.73 A: i'm wondering now like if you if they were to go and they get a test or to get questions that would be similar to ones that they might have on you know a test an upcoming test um 

111.52 112.36 B: mhm 

115.59 116.58 B: mhm 

118.11 119.06 B: mhm 

120.11 120.98 A: i mean 

121.17 130.88 A: because they could basically formulate their own questions i i'm just wondering how they would consider that to be kind of like a bad thing i mean it's not cheating i mean it's not like they're out 

130.11 132.23 B: yeah but they do cheat with them 

132.73 133.92 B: they do cheat 

133.58 137.98 A: but how do they do that i guess that's what i'm trying to understand because like 

136.31 145.27 B: um sometimes they're able to um get into an inst- instructor's computer you know and like get that test right 

141.72 144.94 A: okay all right sometimes they're able to do that 

145.07 150.38 A: okay so you mean like actually go and find out what his password might be to 

150.00 152.01 B: mhm mhm 

150.43 153.07 A: (( okay okay yeah well that's cheating )) 

152.40 153.39 B: mhm 

153.30 159.34 A: i mean that typically i mean i just basically feel that of course computers i i i think they're great i mean 

153.45 154.30 B: right 

158.16 160.11 B: mhm me too i love 'em 

159.62 161.94 A: oh god we're you know i love what 

161.03 169.71 B: i i don't know how i'd have survived you know without the internet for for for the years that i didn't but now that i have it i don't i don't think i could go back to not ever having it you know 

169.26 180.64 A: exactly i mean it's just such a great thing i mean in terms of 'cause people get information or like right now like you know we're talking about this topic to be able to go in and just punch in a few key words 

171.93 173.18 B: mhm 

173.53 174.75 B: mhm 

175.00 177.47 B: mhm mhm 

177.67 178.56 B: right 

179.54 181.55 B: mhm exactly 

180.76 185.71 A: and um you know get some information download some information on on the subject 

182.71 184.02 B: mhm 

185.37 196.78 B: i mean it's just um you can make money with it you can you know do your ah banking and you know i mean it it just makes life so much easier and you don't even have to leave home if you don't want to 

190.93 191.71 A: (( mm )) 

197.28 207.75 A: i mean because i know like right now um i think what is also great that they're doing with computers in terms of learning is that you know the on line classes some colleges you know they have that set up 

205.78 207.06 B: mhm 

207.26 208.39 B: right 

207.77 208.92 A: um 

209.32 220.21 A: you know i i think that's a pretty great thing especially if a person is working and wants to further their education you know advance in terms of getting another degree or whatever 

211.38 212.49 B: it is 

214.05 215.07 B: mhm 

216.23 217.24 B: mhm 

219.38 220.35 B: mhm 

220.01 226.25 A: um that they wouldn't have to worry about maybe travelling you know travel time is the big thing you know 

223.49 225.09 B: mhm 

225.52 226.50 B: right 

226.40 229.63 A: working nine maybe eight nine ten hours a day 

229.15 230.27 B: mhm 

229.85 236.93 A: and then having to go and sit in a class for another hour and a half or you know something of that sort i mean it could be quite draining 

233.54 234.48 B: mhm 

234.96 235.86 B: mhm 

236.46 238.24 B: yeah yeah i think that's 

237.04 241.82 A: so i think that that's a really good thing i think that's a great thing that they have going with that how do you feel about that 

240.53 252.94 B: yeah yeah i feel that's an excellent thing and like you say you don't have to leave home you can you know have your kids and and still be doing your work and you know you could with watching them at the same time so it's like you could um 

248.56 249.61 A: mhm 

253.11 258.42 B: you know be multiplexing you know and being um continuing your education all at the same time 

255.20 256.06 A: mhm 

258.06 260.07 A: mhm 

259.59 269.52 B: so i think that um they're great but somebody's always going to find you know something bad to come out of it but overall i think they're an excellent tool 

269.35 270.76 A: mhm 

270.55 285.26 A: yeah i mean 'cause there's a down side to everything you know the good and bad kind of coexists side by side you know always and i tend to try to stay focussed more on the you know the positive uses you know i don't have that kind of diabolical mind where i want to go and 

272.34 273.41 B: mhm 

275.17 276.13 B: mhm 

276.64 277.52 B: mhm 

281.10 282.10 B: mhm 

282.18 283.01 B: yeah 

285.14 289.34 A: you know hack in to somebody else's private stuff 

286.75 287.88 B: mhm 

288.53 290.16 B: mhm 

289.46 290.92 A: and um 

291.04 294.87 B: i wouldn't have the patience to try and do it i just wouldn't you know [laughter] 

292.59 294.22 A: yeah yeah i mean i know 

294.25 299.71 A: see i mean i like using computers i do but i don't have a love for computers 

295.78 297.51 B: me too i love it 

298.10 298.92 B: mhm 

299.16 300.54 B: mhm 

299.87 307.37 A: um so it's not something where i actually would like to invest that kind of time to find out how to do that i mean the extent of 

304.59 306.42 B: mhm me either 

306.57 312.91 B: i just want to do my things and the ways that it helps me then you know and then because you know 

310.04 310.76 A: (( mm )) 

313.31 318.86 B: there are such a variety of ways that i use it to enhance my life so you know i just want it to 

319.30 321.90 B: be able to do that you know and i wouldn't 

320.99 326.25 A: exactly i mean that's that's pretty much the extent of my my interest as well i mean i 

324.93 325.92 B: mhm 

326.40 338.83 A: guess i'm not trying to learn any any really in depth applications you know in terms with the computer i mean i'd just like to use it basically for you know to research things and to do you know take care of my private affairs you know 

329.34 331.12 B: mhm me either 

331.84 332.78 B: mhm 

335.20 337.38 B: mhm mhm 

337.73 338.77 B: mhm 

338.73 341.93 A: that's really about it but um 

339.86 340.93 B: right 

343.20 344.86 A: yeah i mean i 

345.00 350.99 A: think that yeah ultimately it's a very good thing you know it's a very good thing um 

347.69 348.58 B: me too 

349.43 350.53 B: mhm 

351.71 361.39 A: wow hey look i can't shed look i can't shed a whole lot of light on this topic not like the other two look i talked about i had two other other topics that were pretty good but 

360.09 362.73 B: [laughter] okay this is my first one in a while 

362.32 363.38 A: are you serious 

362.99 363.86 B: uh-huh 

363.39 365.88 A: how how how long have you done this how often have you done this 

365.61 367.66 B: um this is my second time 

367.17 369.13 A: (( oh this is your second time okay )) 

367.74 373.22 B: yeah i i think i did one like a couple of months ago and it was about um 

372.75 374.39 A: you did it the three 

375.31 378.11 A: ah the three call ins or whatever or [cough] 

377.42 379.57 B: no mhm mhm i just did one 

378.45 381.39 A: or you just did one like this oh okay 

379.78 380.59 B: right 

381.01 389.41 B: and i talked to another lady we talked about um something about trials or victims i think or something like that but ah it was pretty interesting 

386.40 387.19 A: okay 

389.08 391.48 A: mhm wow 

389.45 391.33 B: (( mhm )) 

391.70 392.83 B: well 

392.52 393.67 A: [laughter] 

393.10 396.21 B: not [laughter] about education and computers 

393.69 406.32 A: [laughter] hey look isn't that deep i tell you it loo- it loo- that was a pretty open and shut discussion there um what kinda what else could i add to this let me let me think 

401.99 402.94 B: (( yeah )) 

405.75 410.60 B: but it is you know very educational i think for the kids um even the um 

408.76 409.83 A: mhm 

411.04 423.77 B: um kindergarten kids are learning you know to use the computer and i think that's a good thing so that they will really be um you know advanced users by the time that they're in maybe fifth or sixth grade probably 

424.32 433.95 B: yeah because i know my grandson he's eleven and he can he can really maneuver around and do a lot of things that you know i couldn't a few years ago so 

433.47 437.06 A: mhm and they actually need to know those things 

436.44 437.59 B: yeah they do 

437.26 439.65 A: absolutely need to know them 

438.21 442.42 B: yeah because it's a very um highly technolog- 

442.08 447.03 A: (( hold on one second yeah yeah i'm on the phone )) 

442.79 443.67 B: mhm 

450.02 450.85 A: hello 

450.94 452.45 A: yes i'm sorry 

451.88 452.65 B: okay 

453.39 458.46 B: yeah our world is so um high tech nowadays that the kids have to know these things 

456.26 458.05 A: (( yeah )) 

458.74 468.79 A: yes i'm sorry yeah everything is so very high tech now and it's absolutely computer knowledge is absolutely essential and i think the earlier that it starts the better 

460.90 462.68 B: mhm 

465.35 466.39 B: yeah 

467.63 470.10 B: the better mhm true 

468.65 477.93 A: because i didn't encounter um computers and at the time when i was learning i mean p._c.s were just really becoming all the rage 

472.87 473.81 B: mhm 

477.33 478.35 B: yeah 

478.03 479.74 A: me i was back in the 

478.54 481.38 B: when was this like in the nineties or something 

481.05 492.58 A: yeah well you know this was back in the early eighties this is back around about ah because i went to dobbin and i took computer technology i was in that um shop you know the vocational school and um 

483.15 484.04 B: okay 

487.39 488.38 B: mhm 

490.68 491.63 B: right 

492.83 493.92 A: (( you know we were )) 

492.98 497.11 B: yeah i think i started around eighty six or something like that mhm 

495.44 496.47 A: (( oh okay )) 

496.63 502.10 A: we were using then ah they were just coming off the punch cards and that kind of thing um 

500.23 503.09 B: mhm yeah we didn't even have the internet then 

502.54 509.97 A: yeah there was no internet there was none of that stuff i mean everything was still black and white computers were still black and white graphics and all that stuff 

503.47 505.52 B: mhm mhm 

506.03 506.97 B: yeah 

507.56 510.48 B: and they were you know kind of big right 

510.10 516.67 A: yeah they were big and bulky and took up basically your whole desk you know all the space on your desk top um 

510.89 511.90 B: yeah 

512.93 514.83 B: mhm mhm 

515.07 516.13 B: (( yeah )) 

516.83 525.21 A: but um yeah even then i mean we still all these different software applications they have now we had to program in 

524.77 525.84 B: mhm 

525.66 527.84 A: we had to actually program in 

527.72 528.95 B: mhm 

528.30 529.98 A: and um 

530.47 537.52 A: yeah i mean that was very laborious i mean if you wanted it to go into print things in a certain column in a certain way 

536.97 538.24 B: mhm 

537.55 543.81 A: um you know certain text you had to go and do a flow chart and program all that stuff in so 

542.41 543.42 B: yeah 

543.54 545.35 B: i know that was time consuming 

544.81 551.48 A: oh very time consuming and then if you have an error you've got to go back and you know i mean oh wow that just you know 

546.14 547.26 B: mhm 

548.61 549.63 B: yep
