0.05 0.87 A: (( [mn] )) 

0.89 6.76 A: my name is dawn scharnagl s. c. h. a. r. n. a. g. l. 

7.04 13.06 A: phone number's eight five six two nine six zero eight zero eight two eight um i believe 

13.27 17.07 A: being a graduate of the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania 

17.04 18.79 A: um having 

18.74 27.34 A: had a masters as well as a bachelors and um a second bachelors um i can see the difference between 

27.25 36.68 A: computerization in my education which was most recent a masters um versus my original bachelors [noise] 

36.95 44.41 A: in nineteen eighty eight and i i think it made a world of difference um when i went back to school i felt as though 

45.09 46.10 A: i 

46.39 55.92 A: was a little out of out of touch and i can remember um having to go to the library and spend time there late late late at night 

56.04 61.60 A: um computerization certainly changed that i was able to go home and do all the research for 

61.97 68.98 A: and obtain the same information from the convenience of my home and typically as i was searching i would find 

69.15 78.36 A: maybe other topics or more information or other things of interest so whereas if i were using paperback books in the library 

78.37 85.52 A: i would only have learned about [mn] the one topic that i set out to learn so i think there is peripheral learning 

85.77 96.75 A: um i also believe that there is the ability to do a lot of virtual group settings group meetings through the computer via download 

97.21 103.62 A: [lipsmack] ah forwarding um it has enabled me in ah project teams to 

104.24 111.73 A: send my work to other students have them edit it and send it back so i think that that was really good and we didn't have to together 

111.82 115.80 A: um so in terms of education i think it improves 

116.11 118.82 A: um if someone wanted to 

119.09 131.66 A: not learn i guess it could be a negative they could pull something off the internet that's not copyrighted and turn it in as their own but um i would say for the most part my experience with the other students 

131.81 135.74 A: is that we used every bit of technology to our advantage 

136.33 142.00 A: um i think i actually wound up learning more about the subject that i was researching 

142.34 150.11 A: because i didn't in the library i would just get one or two pieces that allows you to have like in a little encapsulated view of 

150.16 150.98 A: um 

151.03 163.07 A: the topic and you might read it you might not um you might just put it aside for later but you've actually experienced you know how many hits in terms of the internet and ah as far as computerization 

163.26 169.69 A: um just the fact that you have a cleaner copy ah spell check i think is 

169.86 176.71 A: maybe it does not do our society justice [laughter] i think it probably prevents just like the math part 

176.73 182.60 A: ah people from learning how to spell because they rely on that um i also think that 

182.77 191.35 A: the math side there there's a potential downside and think that in a lot of cases when i went to school which would be you 

191.78 204.30 A: know right up until nineteen eighty four you would do a lot of math in your head and i think now if you had to do percentages i think the students of today are very reliant upon computerization 

204.73 205.51 A: (( um )) 

209.04 210.88 B: [noise] that was a lot dawn 

211.02 211.83 A: [laughter] 

211.63 212.56 B: [laughter] 

211.89 215.19 A: oh was that a lot was that ten minutes i didn't know i thought i was being record- 

213.49 220.99 B: no no no that wasn't ten minutes that was just a lot [laughter] [noise] you filled in a lot of time um my name is colleen 

221.28 222.11 A: mhm 

221.82 223.40 B: and 

223.48 233.33 B: okay let me just give you my input um my input would be now i i come from a a really different background because i'm a home school mom 

233.45 235.51 B: and i've taught my children at home 

235.57 241.68 B: um and i do agree i think i think computer literacy is absolutely essential 

241.50 251.86 B: but i think that if [mn] depending on what we're talking about now you're talking about higher education and i think absolutely in higher education i i don't even know how people work or function 

251.92 253.01 A: [laughter] 

251.93 257.56 B: without you know without computers i mean it's just you know it's just 

257.67 265.19 B: [mn] such an asset i don't even see the liabilities except for plagiarizing you mentioned plagiarizing and i can understand 

263.61 264.35 A: (( ahah [noise] )) 

264.98 273.74 B: that that could be a problem but i think that that probably has always been a problem we could you know you could find a book or you could find another um 

273.95 283.85 B: you know you can find other written work that you could plagiarize and and probably ah get away with it um to a certain extent i think in college but um 

284.06 292.29 B: i think and and one of the things you mentioned was spell check which i've i i'm a i'm a terrible speller i'm just terrible 

292.21 306.95 B: and i think that i have noticed in home schooling my children that some people have an aptitude for spelling and some people don't and i think even with spellcheck i think if you're the type of person that has an aptitude for spelling and you 

300.55 301.42 A: yes [noise] 

307.18 310.37 B: um are going to be a good speller i think 

310.41 316.31 B: spell check then will enhance i don't think it becomes a crutch and i think for the people who 

316.90 319.06 B: are not good spellers 

319.11 322.40 B: it's it's a needed crutch i think that 

322.33 336.67 B: um certainly i you know even when my children didn't have aptitude for spelling i drilled them on spelling words all the way up through high school even because of my own struggle with spelling i thought it was really important that they 

336.75 337.59 B: at least 

337.77 340.97 B: get as much as they could but um 

338.92 339.48 A: (( [noise] )) 

341.32 343.18 B: but i do think 

343.21 355.23 B: that it you know it's an excellent tool for people who have studied spelling you know throughout grade school and high school and still can't spell [laughter] because there are some of us that let's face it 

353.98 358.11 A: oh it definitely allows you to go i mean think about the students 

358.15 360.75 A: going back and using the dictionary 

361.34 362.21 B: yes 

361.61 362.65 A: um 

362.31 366.60 B: i mean that that just is so consuming i think it discourages 

366.91 370.69 B: students you know i mean i know from myself and that 

370.95 383.65 B: prior to using t- computers i used to say to my kids if they would ask me how to spell something because i was not a good speller i would say to them get the dictionary and they did but now that they you know once they got into high school 

382.93 387.13 A: oh it teaches you how to spell the word if you use it enough and it keeps coming up 

386.26 392.31 B: exactly exactly i think it's like almost the same as looking a word up it's and then 

392.34 401.22 B: um there are you know what there are those times when you might think you're spelling something right and you would never think to look in the dictionary as a student you know a young student 

401.24 406.48 B: um but it shows you that you aren't right it's like that instant correction 

404.23 405.93 A: repet- repetition is 

406.24 409.44 A: really good i think if you do it enough times 

409.47 419.64 A: you will pick up on it if spell check picks it up every time sometimes it's the only word sometimes it's in a whole you know group of text you may not remember it but 

419.63 425.37 A: as you i think eventually you just get good at it you learn to spell the word the common words 

422.77 423.99 B: i think so too 

424.11 435.10 B: i think so too and i think that it's almost like it's very much like instant um grading you know when you grade somebody's paper right away and you say got that wrong and that wrong and that wrong 

435.09 443.37 B: and the student can automatically it's just automat- it it's it's very instantaneous and and that i think reinforces learning 

443.49 451.52 B: um rather than down the road somebody looking at your paper and saying well you spelled that wrong but you know it's been three days since you spelt it so you're 

451.67 453.80 B: (( you know i think that instant correct- )) 

452.05 462.19 A: yeah you're right yeah because you just did it i think in terms of math though i think it can be a little bit the computers can be downside i really do 

462.59 465.81 B: now what what what i mean what is your feeling why is that 

465.55 466.59 A: um 

467.66 470.71 A: (( i think you're still forced to spell )) 

471.49 480.94 A: regardless of whether you're using a computer or not in everyday life but you're not necessarily forced to add ah or subtract or do you know minor math 

475.27 476.14 B: mhm 

481.20 483.71 A: it is it is different um 

484.18 486.87 A: i see a lot of 

487.03 492.03 A: like it used to be crucial to figure out [mn] you know just the basics um 

492.66 502.35 A: and i the reason i was so good at it and i'd go in a store with twenty percent off or if you ever look at the cashier who's behind the counter and she's bright she's you know obviously in high school 

502.71 510.03 A: and can't figure out twenty percent what's ten percent off what's the tax you know sales tax they struggle with that 

506.18 507.88 B: right right right right 

509.58 510.96 B: exactly 

510.81 516.25 A: um which is something i didn't struggle with but i see a lot more of that so i'm guess- [noise] 

514.97 529.87 B: yeah you're probably right i guess i've never used it much at home for math um in home schooling my kids i've never used the computer really for math except for math games and stuff like that just to supplement i've never used it for math curriculum 

529.90 538.30 A: i think the calculator actually did it [laughter] it did a whole generation and maybe that's not computerization but the calculator did a lot of 

532.03 533.58 B: yeah yeah 

539.28 549.02 A: because i can figure that stuff out in my head and i see they just look at you with a blank stare and i'm like you tell me you don't get this and they don't 

548.18 549.34 B: (( i know i know )) 

549.59 554.31 B: i know i think that that's true i think that's true and that was another 

554.48 561.67 B: another thing that i never used with my kids until they got into higher algebra then i allowed them to use the calculator to cut the time but 

561.86 567.57 B: to me it was essential that they knew how to do it they knew how to figure this out before they 

566.20 567.35 A: (( [noise] )) 

567.70 569.14 B: you know leaned 

569.37 574.12 B: on some other kind of technology you know to figure it out for them 

574.60 576.56 B: but yeah i think you're right 

577.82 582.83 A: [noise] and whatever we did back then has worked for me today i don't know 

583.56 590.49 A: what that what i would be like well i guess i got a taste of it i mean it wasn't it's not long ago that i received my masters 

590.53 591.16 A: (( um )) 

591.31 599.96 A: but it was a shock initially [laughter] i was like i remember the computer was a little bit of a frightening thing i'm like okay
