18.07 20.49 B: oh you do good very good 

18.82 20.61 A: yes yes 

20.87 24.37 A: um about this topic of um 

24.51 29.09 A: computers in education you know what they want for 

29.28 34.22 A: is that how it was have they i think that they definitely 

29.41 30.82 B: have they improved 

34.59 39.91 A: can improve education but i'm not quite sure 

40.20 43.25 A: ah they're doing so yet 

43.34 57.65 A: i just have um i was a teacher and um but i retired before in the school that i was in i retired before um 

58.78 70.07 A: it was really they really starting using ah the computers and and really integrating them into the educational system 

70.28 71.88 A: and um 

72.03 75.59 A: i just have a feeling that the 

76.19 78.49 A: i think that that that 

78.71 82.30 A: the children coming up will be much 

82.37 92.47 A: more able to integrate do that integration i think that that i'm not so sure how much the teachers today 

92.56 94.09 A: (( can um )) 

94.37 99.85 A: put it bring um computers into the classroom and into their 

100.35 102.84 A: education what do you think 

102.52 116.43 B: well i i think kind of along the same lines as you i think that they have um i think it's improved education i think that technology has um opened up you know when i was coming up and probably when you were coming up 

116.60 126.89 B: we went to the in we went to the library and checked and looked at and sat there and looked through encyclopedias and now now all the information is right at your fingertips but what i'm finding is 

121.17 122.20 A: yes 

126.88 135.16 B: that kids are coming out of school very computer literate but they can't spell because they don't you know they're used to spell check 

132.39 133.39 A: right 

135.17 136.47 B: they i mean they 

136.98 142.14 B: they don't have good spelling they're not equipped with good spelling tools they um 

143.35 146.96 B: they don't write as well i don't think 

147.26 148.34 B: um 

148.40 152.04 B: and they you know they're just taking all these shortcuts they 

152.31 154.30 B: they don't have good 

154.44 159.79 B: you know it kind of equates over to you know calculators and then they've got calculators now in the computer 

160.18 162.65 B: they don't learn the basics i don't think 

162.70 171.54 B: and so i think in one way computers have improved education by opening up every single avenue of um 

172.07 178.76 B: of information the information highway is there but the basic skills are possibly being overlooked 

178.81 185.63 A: yeah i i agree wholeheartedly with with that i think that there's a lot of things 

185.82 199.11 A: like in writing um like you're talking you're not talking about penmanship there you're talking about just writing i think there's something about 

192.01 193.47 B: no uh huh 

195.49 197.06 B: (( writing skills mhm mhm )) 

199.14 202.13 A: maybe this is being very old fashioned but 

202.42 213.96 A: ah i just think there's something about picking up a pencil and having paper in front of you and being able to cross it out and see it um 

213.89 217.78 A: and do it that way but that but there again 

217.91 227.48 A: i mean that's my way so i'm not sure maybe for ah like even when i was filling out this form 

227.63 228.58 A: (( um )) 

228.62 241.65 A: to get into this study i was making mistakes and and the you know trying to correct myself and stuff like that and i'm not used to what i'm using a web t._v. 

241.67 243.33 A: and um 

243.66 244.81 A: (( ah )) 

245.02 259.44 A: i just i was getting frustrated whereas if i had a pencil and eraser i think it would have been easier for me but i ah i feel the same like that putting down the ideas 

259.56 264.42 A: um on a piece of paper and developing them 

264.52 268.45 A: um ah just helps 

268.54 269.60 A: (( and )) 

269.88 279.42 A: ah but i do think but it helps to me but i think that the kids are it's such a part of them now 

278.85 280.02 B: it is 

279.56 282.36 A: (( that by the time they )) 

282.58 287.76 A: are um teachers and um you know 

288.62 291.69 A: in the classroom and working with students 

292.29 294.15 A: i think maybe they'll 

294.47 299.66 A: you know come up with better ideas and so on on how to use 

299.84 302.33 A: the computer or whatever 

301.18 311.51 B: well i think if if the kids are taught the basics and then use the computer to enhance some of the basic skills i think that would be 

311.73 316.30 B: fine but now there's computers that correct your grammar 

316.73 319.01 A: (( true and that's true i mean )) 

316.75 317.63 B: um 

318.12 323.37 B: and i mean you know they they it's got a grammar check and so 

323.45 334.68 B: you know if there's a grammatical error it's underlined or highlighted in some way and it and it puts in the correct grammar so you're really not learning and so um 

335.18 343.19 B: you know if you if you don't if if it's not learned then if you go somewhere without a computer then you're kind of up a creek because you don't have these basic skills 

343.67 348.66 A: right right and you need that just for just 

348.73 353.52 A: i mean in everyday living really i mean to get a job 

353.55 359.98 A: to get a good job um you know they'd need some some ah 

360.01 366.97 A: at least some idea of how to write a letter or what paragraphs or or whatever 

366.39 367.63 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

367.06 371.27 A: that kind of thing sentences just basic sentence structure 

370.94 372.28 B: (( mhm yep )) 

371.37 372.59 A: (( and um )) 

372.90 375.18 A: ah what do you see a solution 

375.43 384.43 B: um i you know i think that for well you've been a teacher so i think that you can probably really relate to this but i think um making sure the kids 

384.50 391.42 B: in the you know even in the lower grade schools come you know start with the basic skills and build on those skills then 

391.57 399.28 B: you know computer literacy is fine well and good and it's and it's great because you cannot really operate in this world today without a computer 

399.08 414.01 B: but to have the basic skills at your fingertips knowing that when you make a spelling error you can correct the spelling and know the correct spelling of the word rather than have the computer do it for you i i think it's just kind of an integration into good skills and good computer skills 

414.11 420.66 A: so you would have you would have them have a regular the same 

420.69 422.90 A: kind of a curriculum 

422.45 423.59 B: mhm 

422.95 424.93 A: and then um 

425.00 429.60 A: at the lower level at least and then have um 

427.10 428.11 B: right 

429.86 431.61 A: computers 

432.46 433.90 A: maybe 

434.15 437.83 A: reinforce those skills 

435.60 438.32 B: right reinforce those skills 

438.13 439.83 A: and um 

440.29 442.21 A: or add on to 

442.02 444.17 B: right exactly 

442.27 446.52 A: reinforcing them yeah that sounds like a good idea that 

445.47 458.17 B: right but you know even in the gra- even in the lower levels kids are using computers even in kindergarten right now i mean very basic comp um keyboarding things but um you know they they start them early mhm 

457.64 464.02 A: yeah i haven't been in a school in a while now you know to see 

464.12 476.50 A: i've been in a school but i haven't been in like um like kindergarten or whatever primary school to see what they're doing with the um 

477.14 481.45 A: with computers um in the classroom have you 

481.15 488.13 B: mhm um yeah i really have um my daughter is a social worker at a at a like one of those like 

488.47 489.70 B: ah several 

489.71 492.63 B: ho cluster homes for um abused children 

492.54 496.55 B: and and so she works directly with the school system so she i 

492.65 493.53 A: oh 

495.91 497.02 A: oh 

496.42 502.80 B: went on a tour with her and um it's just really amazing they've got ah they've got computers just pretty much 

502.62 514.24 B: not in every classroom they have what they call computer labs but all the classrooms have the availability to go to the computer lab and actually they they start them out very very young 

514.49 515.46 B: um 

514.86 516.33 A: oh wow 

515.65 524.99 B: and ah so you know that's made ah typing classes you know when i was in high school we i had to take a whole semester of typing it's made all that obsolete keyboard now it's keyboarding 

521.80 523.23 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

523.30 524.34 A: [laughter] 

525.36 532.35 A: oh right right because i've seen that written keyboarding they don't call it typing 

528.81 529.77 B: mhm 

530.07 531.11 B: keyboarding 

531.66 540.92 B: nope they don't call it typing anymore so they they start learning those skills so early and so by the time they're they're in the seventh eighth and ninth grade they're 

541.09 544.38 B: they're whiz kids on the computer [laughter] 

543.34 548.77 A: yes yeah well i remember when i was in school i mean there were kids that were 

549.00 556.08 A: coming to school and they really knew the computer very very well and it was 

553.10 554.09 B: mhm 

556.60 560.59 A: and at that time the school was um 

560.73 570.76 A: talking about this is about eleven twelve years ago and the school i was in a parochial school and the school was talking about um 

571.05 574.78 A: ah at that time we had a computer 

575.09 586.95 A: or a couple of computers in some of the classes not my class but in some of the the math classes and the science classes and um 

587.07 590.37 A: they were going to be putting um 

591.03 599.89 A: sort of like what you mentioned a computer lab idea where there's classes with all 

596.46 597.28 B: (( mhm mhm mhm ))
