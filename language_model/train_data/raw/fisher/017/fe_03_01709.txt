21.13 22.59 A: hi [laughter] 

23.13 24.06 A: um 

24.07 27.23 A: shall we talk about the topic if you don't want to know anything about me 

26.85 28.93 B: (( [laughter] yeah [laughter] sure )) 

28.76 37.65 A: okay um well i guess our topic is that do we consider any other country a threat to united states and if yes then which and why 

37.73 38.74 B: (( mm-kay )) 

38.63 41.30 A: yes um do you want to go ahead 

40.69 41.83 B: (( um )) 

42.32 49.14 B: right now i don't consider any other country a threat i did but right now i do not consider any other country a threat 

48.84 55.76 A: oh really a- uh well what do you think about uh what do you think about the war that just happened with iraq 

50.01 50.89 B: do you 

55.62 57.19 B: i think it was a good thing 

57.35 65.96 A: um yeah do you think like if iraq or saddam hussein wasn't considered a threat then why did why did bush really take on the war 

66.43 73.73 B: i personally think he was a threat and i i personally think he's g- we're still going to find uh weapons of mass destruction 

73.71 74.77 A: oh really 

74.43 77.55 B: so i i think eventually we'll find some 

77.98 78.86 A: okay 

78.00 83.42 B: and i also think that uh he's done harm to an awful lot of people we'll never know about 

82.85 91.82 A: oh really but then do you do you think at some point in time are you do you think even a pa- part of it is justified or anything or do you think what he did was absolutely 

92.18 95.44 A: you know it it was just not the way it should have been 

95.42 98.39 B: uh that saddam was justified or bush 

96.77 99.56 A: no no bush's bush's uh 

98.84 100.95 B: i think bush was justified 

100.85 105.71 A: oh he was so then do you think then iraq was or was not a threat 

101.65 102.59 B: yes 

105.90 108.70 B: at that time i think iraq was a threat 

108.15 112.24 A: okay so it was good that now his regime is ousted and everything 

111.82 114.94 B: correct but now i i don't consider 

112.35 113.61 A: (( [lipsmack] okay )) 

115.27 116.42 A: um 

115.31 117.20 B: [sigh] anybody a threat 

116.92 129.64 A: okay and do you do you do you think al queda and uh mm you know what happened on september eleventh and people linking it to osama bin laden is any of that really a threat to united states 

129.24 135.46 B: yes i know somebody who was killed in september eleventh so i [mn] definitely feel like 

135.61 137.40 B: [sigh] it was uh [sigh] 

138.28 150.90 B: saddam or [sigh] his partners or his underlings that uh somewhere along the line i do believe that [sigh] it was caused by him or in some way 

151.17 153.44 B: his ideas that caused it 

153.35 154.49 A: (( oh okay )) 

154.39 162.97 A: um well i personally do think um although i don't know what the september eleven findings and you know whether it was the al queda and osama bin laden 

162.83 172.68 A: but i do think that um w- the united states is threatened by a whole lot of people and i do believe that um it's you know the islamic community 

172.55 180.24 A: basically it's really really enraged right now and i do feel that um uh you know like 

180.21 186.16 A: basically the muslim population like they're not too happy with bush's yeah so 

184.37 186.43 B: right right 

186.11 196.94 A: yeah so i i don't want to pinpoint any particular coun- country like that and say like well you know let's say m- pakistan or some you know middle east country is threatening united states 

196.83 209.21 A: but i do think you know since you know that community consists of a h- [mn] that community is like pretty huge um we could expect that they could pose a threat to the united states and 

208.99 211.77 B: i think they feel threatened by us too 

210.96 217.79 A: that's yeah but then that is what is ha- that is what happens because you know united states is a superpower you know so people kind of 

216.05 216.96 B: right 

217.71 231.71 A: you know to in order to kind of defend themselves in in order to kind of protect themselves they probably you know leash terrorist activities on us and you know that obviously is a threat to at least the f- the common citizen of united states you know 

226.77 227.36 B: (( mm )) 

231.88 243.22 A: so i don't feel well [mn] they ba- it's kind of you know both ways so and um well i'm i'm from india and uh we're like in constant war with pakistan 

242.84 244.09 B: mhm 

243.44 255.76 A: and uh believe me i'm like i we we're kind of used to it because ever ever ever since we were kids we've always seen you know lynchings and killings on television and you know like it's it's 

254.73 257.82 B: not necessarily by u._s. but by 

256.58 263.56 A: no not necessarily by the united states but like i said we we're at war with pakistan over a over a kashmir issue 

263.09 264.31 B: mhm 

263.67 276.71 A: so like we've been seeing all this pretty much and so it kind of you know it's it's kind of usual for us that okay you open the newspaper and the headlines are you know hundred people killed in jammu in kashmir and things like that so 

276.73 279.88 A: but i don't think people hear they're kind of so used to it so 

279.51 284.18 B: no they aren't i have a very very good friend from india also who 

280.38 281.74 A: (( yeah )) 

283.67 284.26 A: (( [mn] )) 

284.14 294.25 B: feels extremely threatened by all of this and can't go anywhere without being just feeling threatened even if nobody says anything she feels like 

294.06 299.18 B: she is threatened and i i believe she probably has good reason to feel that way that 

299.25 305.30 B: that even though we're not out to get her she thinks that people are and and i'm sure some people would so 

304.50 310.04 A: yeah i yeah because um like you know the what happened september eleventh it's kind of 

310.09 317.63 A: it was something big that rocked america but um believe me these kind of things are kind of normal for us you know back home so 

316.84 318.46 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

317.84 320.26 A: uh yeah so i i believe 

319.09 327.11 B: you don't like to hear it but you you see it all the time right [sigh] yeah she's told me a lot of things she's seen that i never want to see [laughter] never 

322.16 323.71 A: (( yes [laughter] )) 

326.15 340.31 A: exactly so that is that is right and i think also that probably you know it it's it's basically that middle eastern and the al queda and the islamic community that stood out as people who who probably could threaten the united states maximum 

340.29 353.42 A: and i don't know like you said you know they they feel that united states is a threat to them so probably in defence they act and what happens is wars and you know more problems and things like that 

352.72 361.21 B: [laughter] in um just in india without al queda is there not another threat within india to 

353.49 354.32 A: so 

361.40 363.08 B: indians themselves though 

362.87 365.97 A: no it's it's basically w- it's n- 

365.86 379.12 A: i wouldn't say pakistan is al queda but pakistan is a very big thing with us because we are we are constantly in proxy war with them and even the northern part because they we we're fighting over uh trying to protect jammu and kashmir 

379.19 380.31 A: and you know 

379.39 380.43 B: okay 

380.07 387.61 A: yeah and they want it because at the at the time of partition you know that that came to us and that's a very big tourist 

387.43 396.23 A: attraction and it's a very big uh place you know so pakistan wants that too so we've never been able to resolve that that you know but it should 

395.13 399.43 B: so pakistan will always be against you or probably always be against you 

398.84 408.33 A: yeah they are well because they they they claim that well it belongs to us and we say no because at the pa- time of partition it came in our territory so well 

407.41 412.10 B: can you travel i- being in india can you travel back and forth to pakistan or no 

412.08 425.19 A: um uh pr- basically well at the at one point in time our prime minister did start a train kind of as a friendly gesture you know but then i think that was that didn't work out so it's not really safe to travel 

419.46 420.40 B: okay 

425.26 426.11 A: and 

425.39 428.07 B: right it's not safe but i didn't know if it was legal 

427.98 435.64 A: no it it isn't really illegal because uh let me tell you at the time of partition partition many families were split so we still have families 

435.06 436.82 B: (( ah okay )) 

436.16 443.20 A: right you know so you cannot say it's illegal but it definitely isn't safe and it definitely isn't so easy 

438.80 439.80 B: okay 

440.71 441.87 B: safe [laughter] 

443.03 448.95 B: uh she doesn't travel anywhere over there she tells me it's just not safe to stay home it's just not 

449.04 451.23 B: not safe to go anywhere so 

450.66 464.16 A: y- yeah but i wouldn't say it's illegal or anything because yeah i mean because you cannot like y- you cannot allow families not to see each other and stuff but it's it's everybody's personal choice if they do not do that because it's not safe that's it 

453.04 454.01 B: okay 

463.73 466.67 B: okay all right so it's not oh 

464.52 467.45 A: yes um that's how it is and 

467.78 480.04 A: probably because of what happened here recently in the war and everything in united states i think um you know the immigration laws have also become such that you know united states has kind of become a little strict with 

479.67 481.28 B: they're very strict 

480.45 490.69 A: yeah with a- with who to allow and who not to allow to enter their country so it's i i think it's just having its repercussions everywhere and i like y- 

489.60 493.36 B: i think yeah bush is being a little too strict though on 

492.97 494.42 A: yeah because 

493.42 494.64 B: some of his 

494.43 500.98 A: yeah because there are students you know who really deserve to come here and they're just denied visas and stuff like that so 

500.58 509.92 B: i have a a child who's a student at in canada and she cannot come home because of bush bush has closed the border so he 

507.02 508.45 A: oh really 

509.18 511.83 A: oh is it because of sars these days 

511.25 519.69 B: no she she had that but no uh no it's uh t- just because of terrorism because too many of the terrorists were on student visas 

516.73 518.18 A: (( oh really )) 

519.35 520.93 A: oh right 

519.94 523.70 B: so bush closed it to everybody on a student visa can't go either way 

523.33 529.33 A: oh really i thought canada was kind of a little easier because canada and united states kind 

523.93 525.11 B: (( so you know )) 

528.45 541.07 B: they're supposed to be but they're not he he it's a little hidden fact but but bush had closed that and if you're any kind of a student visa if you're just an adult on a regular driver's licence you're fine but 

532.30 534.11 A: [laughter] 

540.45 541.53 A: (( mhm )) 

540.92 544.75 B: [sigh] you cannot go anywhere so hopefully he's gonna 

542.70 544.64 A: mhm 

544.85 551.76 B: change his little mind but i think he kind of went overboard on that and anybody that looks suspicious of any sort and 

548.09 549.96 A: mhm 

550.96 552.48 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

551.88 559.98 B: like the poor little college kids they're and the college kids here are stuck too if you're canadian on a visa here you can't go home either so 

559.27 567.54 A: yeah so actually the thing is i think um a- after that september eleven thing they've started uh they've really started keeping uh data 

567.22 568.16 B: yes 

567.40 575.80 A: files for you know students who come here on a student visa they make sure that they are studying and they are not doing anything else that they're not supposed to do 

569.41 570.27 B: yes 

575.49 581.32 B: she has to check in constantly to make sure that yeah which is good 

575.93 576.64 A: so 

577.80 578.95 A: yes 

580.45 589.75 A: [mn] yeah which is good so that what i mean to say is that that they should still allow people to come and they can what they can do is probably you know keep a tab on them and kind of you know just 

587.98 588.85 B: right 

589.07 599.35 B: [sigh] see what they're doing and make sure they're yeah doing honest things but [sigh] um bush is just going overboard and saying nobody can do anything just in case and 

593.12 594.49 A: yeah 

595.93 597.49 A: [laughter] 

597.75 598.49 A: i 

598.58 599.89 A: i think so too be
