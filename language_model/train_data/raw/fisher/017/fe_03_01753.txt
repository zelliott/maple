139.78 140.49 B: oh 

139.85 143.45 A: er the sanctions you know they have against iraq 

143.44 144.23 B: (( ahah )) 

143.97 149.23 A: that's because we found out how much money france the u._n. 

149.68 152.08 A: germany and russia were making 

152.13 155.83 A: on the [noise] the oil for food 

155.43 156.66 B: (( ahah [noise] )) 

155.96 160.66 A: i i think france was making like seven billion dollars a year on that deal

165.41 171.16 A: now i think it they're just in the stages of that now they found that in documents in iraq [mn] 

170.84 171.72 B: (( oh [noise] )) 

171.99 185.43 A: and the u._n. was was making lots of money off of that even though saddam hussein was taking most of that money and building his his great palaces and keeping all the money for himself instead of giving it to people so 

185.35 186.99 B: right 

186.44 188.61 A: so i'm not sure if that's the reason 

189.08 190.80 B: (( [noise] well i i ))

192.38 194.96 A: (( pushing the resolutions or [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

194.98 199.97 B: [noise] [noise] well i i i think that the whole the war itself 

199.93 213.28 B: was about money i i i [mn] have a hard time believing it you know i i know they had other reasons i mean you can ask anybody they'll give you tons of reasons why they think we we went to war 

213.26 222.17 B: and i mean the oil had a had if not i i believe it it's over fifty percent [laughter] reason why 

220.98 226.33 A: [laughter] well i'm not arguing i'm not arguing that oil had something to do with it cause i believe it definitely did 

226.10 228.22 B: yeah 

226.57 229.98 A: [mn] but i believe there's also some other reasons i you know 

230.76 232.03 B: (( oh yeah well you )) 

231.12 232.70 A: [lipsmack] i i mean 

232.84 237.18 A: after nine eleven i think it changed a lot in the way in the united states 

237.20 245.76 A: i i think to be honest i believe they're afraid that it's gonna happen again and they wanna try to stop it but but 

237.33 238.50 B: (( right )) 

244.52 249.84 B: w- well my saying was that they waited too long to do something about nine eleven 

249.63 251.23 A: oh really 

250.65 254.58 B: i believe well it you know i mean it it goes back 

254.86 264.18 B: you know let man be man let boys be boys l- let's put a situation where you're in the fifth grade and somebody comes and hits you 

263.87 264.81 A: (( [noise] ahah )) 

264.87 266.88 B: and it's a devastating blow 

267.75 271.63 B: i mean if you're going to fight 'em you fight 'em then and there 

271.41 272.87 A: [noise] well that's true 

272.09 284.17 B: as soon as you find out you don't wait until you know you get into the eighth grade [laughter] and you've got all your buddies with you now [laughter] to go get back you know and i i don't know it's it's 

276.85 277.78 A: (( ha [noise] )) 

284.33 288.53 B: i and i mean my heart went out to to the people people in nine eleven but [mn] 

287.52 290.95 A: (( right well i think everybody's [mn] right ahah [noise] )) 

288.71 289.85 B: (( did really to be )) 

290.80 294.54 B: honest but but the world keeps turning life keeps going on 

294.20 295.16 A: (( [noise] )) 

295.15 301.51 B: and you know it it's i don't know so many people dwell on certain things and 

300.91 301.79 A: (( [mn] )) 

301.54 306.17 B: and they lose track and focus on what is really going on but 

306.46 318.47 B: it's it's it's a lot of countries [mn] i mean well i can't say countries but i know there are a lot of people that wouldn't mind taking a bite [laughter] out of the u._s. as a whole 

318.25 320.19 A: and why is that though [mn] 

320.31 322.06 B: w- i mean well 

321.73 331.37 A: i've never done nothing wrong to anybody why would somebody want to kill me i don't know i it's just strange to me how people can think like that they just want to kill me because 

326.85 327.63 B: (( w- )) 

331.69 335.11 A: i don't know i'm not their religion or something you know [noise] [mn] [mn] [mn] 

334.65 336.34 B: is is ew 

336.40 350.21 B: i mean it's it's human nature it's it's human nature it it goes you can go as extreme as their religions as small as like your different groups wh- i mean like you have like ah 

348.74 349.52 A: mhm 

350.90 354.69 B: you know your bully types going back in grade school

368.55 369.36 B: to 

371.89 373.11 A: at all or 

372.41 373.16 B: (( [mn] ))

374.98 376.22 A: i don't know 

376.13 384.96 B: well that's d- david versus goliath [laughter] i mean you know it i i i don't think that there's an enemy that's too little 

384.33 385.88 A: oh really 

385.31 391.04 B: cause i mean you have so many conventional and unconventional ways of going about with things 

390.38 391.65 A: (( right [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

391.05 401.04 B: you can't really you know i mean well okay those they only have a certain amount of people wanting to fight for em but they've got a certain amount of people wanting to fight and go at all costs 

401.29 411.55 B: you know war really i never understood rules of war i mean you're basically trying to kill out you know kill everybody for whatever reason 

411.07 412.21 A: right 

411.62 413.15 B: like you're able to win

413.23 414.10 A: (( ahah )) 

416.83 421.62 B: and to kill masses and i'm you know it's just ah i don't know 

422.23 424.14 B: it's the world that we live in 

423.85 424.55 A: (( [mn] [mn] [mn] )) 

425.52 438.85 A: well i think if they stopped the money maybe an- and you realize most of the money is coming from like saudi arabia and we pretend to be friends with them because we're afraid we'll lose our oil or something i don't know 

429.47 430.04 B: yeah 

435.68 436.81 B: (( oh [mn] )) 

438.76 440.28 B: well y- you know 

439.19 442.83 A: but they're afraid to stand up to saudi arabia i think 

442.25 451.45 B: w- well generally i've been doing my research i i'm twenty years old and i've probably gotten my nose in some books that i probably shouldn't but ah 

444.72 445.59 A: mhm 

451.85 456.05 B: i read up about the oil embargo back in the nineteen seventies 

455.41 456.38 A: (( ahah )) 

456.27 458.58 B: and it surprised me that ah 

458.60 461.36 B: it was a coalition over in the middle east 

460.76 461.87 A: (( ahah [noise] [noise] )) 

461.38 473.12 B: all of them decided they were not going to sell the u._s. an- any oil and basically we was going through back then what we were going through a couple of months ago but it was worse they were rationing out gasoline [laughter] 

473.66 475.69 B: and and so ah ah 

476.53 481.24 B: i i don't know where we get somebody by the name of saddam hussein who 

480.43 482.04 A: (( [mn] mhm )) 

481.31 488.36 B: decides to sell the u._s. oil and we consider him as a quote unquote freedom fighter they have even books 

488.50 489.84 B: (( and ah )) 

490.23 494.15 B: (( [lipsmack] newspaper ah clippings and everything and yeah )) 

492.88 495.57 A: oh when we when we backed saddam hussein 

495.71 496.50 B: (( yeah )) 

495.90 498.11 A: yeah i knew that i remember that 

497.59 500.53 B: and and i i just i can't

500.66 501.25 A: (( [noise] )) 

507.60 511.83 A: [mn] the same thing happened in panama they did that same thing with becker 

511.88 513.09 B: exactly 

512.43 515.04 A: and and then we went yeah 

515.07 521.66 A: [sigh] i think they've gotta cut off the money but but i agree that korea we gotta do something about that but [noise] 

519.69 520.59 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

521.62 526.39 B: yeah we do it it's it's just a resolution or something 

525.76 529.12 A: [mn] i'm not sure a war's always the way but shoo [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

529.46 537.44 B: so well i mean when you have people that that are are are trigger happy and gun happy you know war is always the answer 

537.45 542.62 B: and i mean it's it's obvious there's a lot more people that would support a war 

542.79 545.65 B: than there would be people to support peace 

546.54 557.05 B: and then some other people that that that protest an- and support peace go around go about it in a violent ways and they [laughter] and and that 

555.69 561.98 A: [mn] i support my country and my troops but i'm not not sure i agree with everything they do but
