7.16 11.36 A: ah i didn't really catch the topic i was talking to my mother at the moment so what was it 

11.53 13.32 B: oh the topic was 

13.64 16.41 B: do you consider any um 

17.63 22.34 B: what they said was do you consider any other countries ah to be 

23.12 24.01 B: (( ah )) 

24.17 27.30 B: threats to america's national security and if so why 

27.33 28.68 A: oh okay 

27.65 30.77 B: i don't i don't i don't know what they meant that as as opposed to 

31.14 32.98 A: yeah [laughter] 

31.98 34.16 B: to some particular countries or i 

34.43 35.50 B: i don't know but 

35.75 39.69 A: wow that's a that's an interesting question [laughter] 

38.96 39.96 B: (( where are you from )) 

40.38 45.62 A: um i'm from wol- from colorado although i was raised in south america but 

44.79 47.64 B: oh colorado oh i'm i'm in new jersey 

45.73 47.22 A: (( yeah )) 

48.07 49.19 B: (( so ah )) 

49.38 52.14 B: what do you think do you want to get the ball rolling or 

50.76 62.50 A: [laughter] oh that it's a difficult one because ah i don't know i mean wha- what is a threat to national security i mean i don't think that there is really going to be a like a nuclear war at the moment at least i don't think so 

62.69 65.73 A: ah and whether any country is 

65.93 71.92 A: is gonna declare war on the united states i doubt it totally i'm terrorists organizations you can call them countries i'm not sure 

72.18 74.50 A: so that's that's an interesting question 

75.39 81.20 A: although i heard say that um north korea is developing missiles which might be able to reach the ah 

81.25 83.24 A: (( the ah california )) 

83.53 85.61 A: coast so that's interesting 

85.85 86.75 B: yeah that's 

86.87 93.93 B: that's one country ob- obviously i'm very ah very concerned about another is 

95.65 98.12 B: saudi arabia at least 

98.49 101.02 B: a lot more so than iraq 

101.17 103.27 A: yeah yeah 

102.95 106.01 B: i think the perceived 

107.44 108.35 B: ah 

109.26 110.13 B: threat 

111.39 112.64 B: by iraq 

113.76 114.51 B: (( or )) 

114.79 117.11 B: at least the threat that's been 

118.17 121.12 B: claimed by iraq i think it pales in comparison to 

121.75 122.64 B: ah 

123.42 128.77 B: the threats from other countries particularly saudi arabia but but other countries in the middle east 

129.25 133.36 A: yeah well yeah saudi arabia for instance yeah definitely has some [noise] ah 

133.83 135.20 A: some 

135.81 139.41 A: they're strange i i think it's a very strange country you know 

139.52 148.16 A: and ah the thing is the funny thing is they are also like held to be like the arab country you know i have a friend who is pakistani and he's a 

148.18 155.35 A: he's a pretty strong muslim and he says you know he really admires the saudi way of running the country and you know 

155.58 159.33 A: and so that's sort of current among islam of course you know their 

159.40 173.39 A: their monarchy are very where they where they run ah muslim law and ah of course ah obviously only only muslim religion is allowed every other everything else is definitely not 

173.75 175.72 A: not permitted or at least um 

176.53 180.81 A: no open expression you are not allowed you are not allowed to even attempt attempt to 

180.96 188.92 A: to talk about conversion with with somebody else ah what else was there ah yeah lots of stuff it's it's an interesting country but 

189.21 196.40 A: if ah that's a model for many for many of the more religious muslims it's it's very interesting to say the least 

194.68 196.07 B: (( mm )) 

196.15 199.82 B: well saudi arabia in particular that's where 

201.17 203.08 B: that's from which 

204.35 206.18 B: (( ah wahabbism )) 

206.46 209.62 B: is being exported which is ah you know what that is 

206.54 207.55 A: yeah 

209.91 211.30 B: very radical 

211.60 212.64 B: um 

213.82 215.82 A: oh yeah yeah definitely 

214.73 217.73 B: very scary interpretation of islam 

217.62 218.51 A: (( ahah )) 

219.41 223.94 A: yeah ah it is it is definitely um 

224.12 231.29 A: probably well let's see of course osama bin laden is is is from saudi arabia but ah 

230.03 230.83 B: mhm 

231.79 234.93 A: and um and it's a very populous arabian country also 

234.96 236.09 A: (( ah )) 

236.50 244.83 A: well you know like iran also shou- it's probably pretty hard of course they're much more open about it while the saudi arabians maintain an open 

245.64 251.52 A: ah allegiance with the united states but ah internally they they act very differently 

251.40 252.49 B: yes well 

251.68 252.58 A: so 

252.64 255.15 B: iran's very interesting they have been going through 

257.89 260.05 B: um a lot of um internal 

261.83 263.76 B: ah turmoil of their own 

265.23 267.02 B: it's kind of between 

269.03 274.21 B: more of more of a western influence where you know women can go outside and walk without 

269.18 270.21 A: sort of 

272.89 273.73 A: (( ahah )) 

274.22 277.30 B: wearing hijabs and get get education 

277.48 280.35 B: and things like that versus these ah 

281.27 283.10 B: (( islamic clerics who are )) 

282.79 283.88 A: mhm 

283.24 286.74 B: popping up out of the woodwork and and trying to gain popular support 

287.27 288.94 A: yeah correct 

289.18 291.64 A: yeah yeah pretty much so um 

292.04 298.05 A: so there's a softening of the rent although you know how much of a softening it is i- in general terms i think it is 

298.15 310.94 A: in general they are pretty much still quite a bit like the saudis ah they may be not quite as hard line as they were before before with the ayatollah still you know they they got a lot they're having a lot of influence and so are the saudi arabians and ah 

310.96 312.38 A: definitely ah 

312.47 313.58 A: ah 

313.83 323.93 A: for instance i was remembering ah the current pakistani president you know um ah what's his name he once said he admir- the current pakistani president said he once admired the ah 

319.42 320.16 B: (( the what )) 

324.06 334.10 A: the ah the founder of the turkish republic and he was immediately accosted by the press you know turkey is about the only um democ- well somewhat democratic ah 

334.12 337.46 A: ah muslim republic out there and ah 

337.92 345.18 A: i can- can't really think of any- anybody else i'm not sure if egypt is if it is probably not quite to the same level as turkey is 

345.46 353.65 A: and and when you consider that you know that ah they really that there's a strong push to to move away from ah from a democratic basis 

353.54 365.44 A: it's sort of interesting to see what what's happening there so anyway there was a big push for a ah religious state in quite a few places right now you know the the shiites who who are getting their fir- 

365.33 373.63 A: i guess it's the shiites the shiites who are getting i never remember which is the shiites and which are the sonnies but the shiites are um celebrating their that they are actually able to ah 

373.54 380.66 A: to celebrate their special days you know the martyrdom of i don't know who it was but in any case um 

378.72 379.68 B: mhm 

381.23 386.67 A: they're at the same time that they're able to do this because ah american forces they take they 

386.70 398.53 A: get in and um get rid of saddam at the same time they're still asking there's still ah a few there that are saying oh go go away americans and let us have our our religious ah ah 

398.64 413.49 A: ah monarchy or whatever it is they want and most likely or not those are iranian plants you know people that have um been um influenced by the iranians i am sure the iranians pay a good few few payrolls there and fund some of these groups 

400.76 401.52 B: mhm 

413.68 415.76 A: so yeah 

413.84 414.72 B: yeah 

414.97 416.25 B: good point 

416.10 417.11 A: [laughter] 

417.01 422.69 B: i just yeah i've always thought iraq was interesting too because they diverge so widely from 

423.25 427.06 B: the the fundamentalist world that there be the 

427.97 428.85 B: arab 

429.38 431.18 B: camp socialism where 

431.22 432.22 B: um 

432.77 434.67 B: actually under under the bath- 

434.68 435.92 B: baathist ah 

436.40 437.38 B: party 

437.45 438.37 A: uh-huh 

439.45 441.60 B: religious devoutness was actually 

441.61 442.48 B: (( ah )) 

442.99 444.27 B: frowned upon 

444.74 446.25 A: right right 

445.70 446.84 B: obviously 

447.21 448.13 B: um 

448.27 450.22 B: punished in a lot of instances 

449.65 454.65 A: y- yeah well the interesting thing is that was one of the few places where 

454.74 465.50 A: ah ah outside religious actually the one request religion was the majorge religion the shiites if i remember correctly and ah other religions that are you know christians could as a matter of fact be in there i don't know 

465.55 472.94 A: you know or or or whatever other religions there are there's not much else there really i guess except jews christians and muslims 

472.33 474.80 B: yeah there's also um 

475.24 478.93 B: bahaiism and i think a few zoroastrians running around 

478.28 480.03 A: oh okay yeah 

479.29 480.97 B: but they yeah ob- ob- 

481.39 482.73 B: the bahaiis have 

483.21 486.31 B: kind of gotten oppressed everywhere and 

485.97 486.84 A: (( ahah )) 

486.32 490.15 B: zoroastrians there's there's so few of them it's it's it's such a 

490.75 492.33 B: kind of an esoteric 

492.90 493.87 B: um 

493.96 497.07 B: faith that they're they're just going to get beat up on wherever they are 

497.13 499.63 B: i know i know that's the situation with them in iran 

497.29 498.27 A: yeah 

499.60 503.53 A: oh i didn't even know they still existed frankly 

500.20 501.03 B: (( but ah )) 

503.51 504.74 B: yeah 

504.32 505.42 A: [laughter] 

505.13 506.29 B: it's kind of it's 

507.20 510.64 B: the um the uniqueness of iraq is why a lot of 

511.88 513.17 B: theorists 

515.29 516.26 B: thought that 

517.77 520.95 B: um a regime change in iraq would be a 

520.96 525.19 B: a kind of a foothold into the arab world and introducing 

525.27 526.09 B: (( ah )) 

526.90 529.56 B: democracy and more kind of modern 

529.75 530.60 B: (( ah )) 

530.83 531.90 B: western 

532.46 533.46 B: influence 

533.28 535.64 A: mhm mhm yeah 

534.89 536.70 B: to be honest i'm not sure 

537.02 541.62 B: if that's well it's not an entirely good or entirely bad thing but i'm not 

542.61 544.18 B: i'm not sure whether 

545.37 546.89 B: more of it is ah 

547.93 550.30 B: is goi- is going to be good or harmful 

550.23 556.71 A: yeah well the question of it is ah well getting back to the original question whether it is a um 

556.56 567.05 A: threat to america's security at the moment you know it's very hard to catalogue threats exactly how what what would be a terrorist attack from nine eleven it's 

567.29 571.73 A: very very difficult to say okay this person's a threat this person's not and so on 

571.68 572.52 B: mhm 

571.84 578.06 A: so wow of course if you have weapons of mass destruction in general it's um it's not very good but 

578.07 583.72 A: ah the question is also the character of who was who is holding the weapons of mass destruction you know 

583.99 592.48 A: and um and how they intend to use it so well yeah i guess to them it's it's pretty pretty scary iraqis 

593.11 596.36 A: he was pretty i mean he didn't 

596.70 598.87 A: just seemed strange in different ways 

598.71 599.66 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

599.38 599.96 A: and
