10.88 12.83 A: okay i'm in pittsburgh 

12.14 13.63 B: okay 

13.11 19.07 A: okay and this is my first call [laughter] okay [laughter] so it's computers in education 

14.87 16.46 B: mine too [laughter] 

18.93 22.08 B: yes [laughter] would you like to start [laughter] 

21.41 22.96 A: ah sure 

23.05 30.74 A: i guess i think that computers in education are very helpful i um actually have a degree in elementary education 

30.83 33.04 A: and so i decided not to teach 

33.01 33.98 B: (( oh okay )) 

33.75 41.48 A: doing student teaching and everything i was you know it's a second grade class and they used you know computers they had computer lab every day 

41.04 42.72 B: mhm 

42.50 43.73 A: and um 

45.56 50.26 A: [mn] [noise] i would say that [noise] i mean they have to be obviously very closely monitored 

50.37 51.66 B: right 

52.40 53.42 A: (( [noise] but )) 

54.18 56.71 A: (( i think that i don't know )) 

56.89 57.56 A: (( [laughter] )) 

58.08 66.31 B: yeah um well i i don't have that kind of experience with kids that you have other than friends' kids but um 

61.58 62.29 A: (( [sigh] [mn] [mn] )) 

63.46 64.31 A: (( right )) 

66.75 72.67 B: and and my schooling was before there was a lot of computers available um 

72.97 74.08 B: but um 

74.00 77.70 B: yeah it seems to me that it for the most part it's very helpful 

77.70 91.85 B: um i i've heard that it's gotten a knock of it allows people to find things too easily and you lose the skills of doing being able to do research and and and what it means to go to a library and actually look stuff up 

89.29 90.28 A: that's true 

91.17 101.77 A: that's definitely true i remember i- in high school not spending [noise] so much time at the library or even in junior high and then once they got in college then you know more computers became more 

92.30 93.29 B: yeah 

101.74 108.15 A: you know readily available and you actually had computer classes and that you you would never step foot in a library 

107.87 119.59 B: right right yeah see even when i was in college i took computer programming and they had us working with fortran [laughter] which wasn't quite as helpful [laughter] as the p._c.s of today so um 

115.17 116.71 A: (( [laughter] [noise] yeah [mn] )) 

117.31 118.22 A: (( no )) 

118.64 119.69 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

120.64 132.70 A: yeah when we were growing up we had our texas instrument [laughter] and then pretty much do you know like type in adventure games and stuff but that's pretty much all we did when we were growing up 

124.29 125.74 B: right right 

131.56 133.61 B: c- can i ask how old you are 

133.04 134.60 A: (( i'm thirty okay [noise] )) 

133.73 136.85 B: you're thir- i'm forty so ah yeah um 

136.98 141.29 B: yeah i mean we had a high um a computer in high school but 

141.13 155.44 B: you know with sort of like all a central computer with a couple of different terminals and and all the thing i mainly remember doing with that is is um you know programming stuff in basic and playing games was about it so 

154.60 163.00 A: [noise] [noise] yeah i think all we did was write little programs to make your name blink on the screen or something like that you know kids are [laughter] so silly [noise] [noise] 

158.64 160.23 B: right right 

163.04 163.60 A: (( [mn] )) 

163.22 172.19 B: yeah yeah i mean i have some friends who have like a ten year old a couple of ten year old twin girls and they're you know more proficient than the parents are 

172.25 179.35 B: and um but i you know i really can't say how much they actually use it for education 

179.48 184.73 A: yeah actually in the classroom and since i haven't been there you know for a while 

185.12 185.87 A: (( um )) 

186.18 188.16 A: i don't know but at home i mean 

188.53 197.30 A: [noise] we've done we actually have a very sick cat and i've done tons of research [laughter] i've spent more time on the internet in the last few weeks just learning about 

193.83 194.83 B: (( mhm ahah )) 

197.52 199.64 A: you know different treatments and that for her 

199.51 201.37 B: yeah 

200.32 205.96 A: i think i've gotten you know so much more information than i would've ever gotten just talking to the vets and stuff 

205.56 218.37 B: yeah yeah i would have to say for myself i mean that's the first place i go is the computer when i want to look something up nowadays and it's just it's it's such a great tool i mean i i just love it and and being able to 

209.70 210.72 A: mhm 

218.26 223.17 B: just punch something in and and come up with just a ton of information 

223.29 229.53 B: um you know for so for my own self education it's [laughter] been great if there's something i'm interested in you know it's 

227.33 228.15 A: (( oh yeah )) 

230.22 233.39 B: um i- it's a fantastic tool um 

235.40 236.76 B: so um 

236.89 243.35 B: yeah for for f- that aspect of it ah i really like it i like it a lot i think it's a great thing 

242.20 251.85 A: yeah i think i can't i guess the the biggest downfall would probably be with children would be not going to a library and actually looking things up on you know in books but 

252.60 256.28 A: (( for adults and that you know i think it's terrific that's right )) 

255.81 257.64 B: right yeah yeah 

257.68 265.86 B: when um you know and books can end up being outdated very quickly especially compared to this stuff that's out on the net so 

268.33 269.23 B: (( but ah )) 

269.57 272.60 B: what else to say about it [laughter] 

270.84 272.93 A: (( [laughter] it's not )) 

272.94 279.20 A: it's not my my favorite topic [laughter] or one that [laughter] i know a whole lot about 

278.37 285.32 B: [laughter] yeah yeah when i fir- when i first heard what it was i was like mm what am i going to say about this 

284.96 288.19 A: like oh it's my first phone call do i press one [laughter] 

286.82 288.96 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

288.65 289.81 A: [laughter] 

291.25 292.60 B: but um 

291.62 292.88 A: [noise] 

293.06 298.77 B: [mn] i'm just trying to think of wh- what i've heard on the news about it and what not and um um 

300.41 304.33 A: lately there doesn't y- you know i think it's kinda died down some 

304.35 306.40 A: (( you know at one point there was you know )) 

306.88 309.61 A: a lot more controversy and that but no i don't 

309.00 310.47 B: right 

310.77 313.72 A: think i've heard too much about it 

313.04 315.36 B: right i take it you don't have kids 

315.42 317.39 A: nope not yet [laughter] 

316.04 317.33 B: (( n- no t- [mn] )) 

317.34 319.70 B: i don't eith- either so ah i 

319.84 324.05 B: guess having them would obviously give us a lot more [laughter] experience but ah 

323.03 324.14 A: probably 

325.86 327.35 B: yeah um 

327.19 331.15 A: [mn] yeah i know i'm pretty much on it every single day looking something up 

331.08 333.20 B: yeah yeah 

331.37 339.77 A: even if it's just recipes or we um just bought a house and my husband's constantly looking up you know different how to projects and stuff 

339.68 342.43 B: right yeah yeah 

344.05 344.84 A: (( and )) 

344.65 354.78 B: yeah i- it can be helpful for that sometimes it can be difficult to actually find stuff too and and ah you know you put in something and you get so many things that are actually advertisements 

354.09 358.94 A: [noise] tha- that's the advertising is bad and you could be totally sidetracked 

358.51 359.89 B: yes yes 

359.10 365.76 A: i'll go to look up one thing and then two hours later [laughter] you realise you know you've been led in so many different directions and 

361.93 363.74 B: yes [laughter] 

364.70 367.28 B: i've had that happen many times too 

366.57 373.64 A: [laughter] or up way too late [laughter] thinking oh i really should go to bed now and then i'm off reading um 

370.12 371.73 B: right right 

373.87 375.87 A: all different kind of crazy things 

375.43 384.15 B: yeah but i i i've also have looked up how to stuff and actually sometimes had trouble finding stuff um 

382.90 384.01 A: mhm 

383.92 392.78 B: just because i- i- it is like [mn] most of what comes up is something for companies or or you know something that they want you to pay for 

389.32 390.42 A: (( that's right )) 

391.96 393.15 A: (( mhm right )) 

392.93 393.95 B: um 

394.09 403.92 B: or i'll put something into a forum to to try to do a search and and the things that come up aren't really the subject that i'm looking for so um 

404.53 409.38 B: you know and i wonder how much you know with kids how much they get taught 

409.55 421.56 B: how to actually look things up and and and do their own self filtering that way you know i i'd be actually i'd you know i'd be kind of curious to know how ah how they are taught that and 

411.80 412.76 A: that's true 

414.23 415.05 A: right 

421.86 429.80 B: um you know and how to discern what's actually valuable from you know and how much they get targeted wi- with advertising and 

429.19 432.36 A: that's right y- you know what'd be scary you'd have to like actually 

432.42 437.86 A: sit there and really really monitor what they watch because they could be led all over the place 

437.46 439.95 B: right right yeah i can imagine 

440.42 442.23 A: i guess there are things though 

442.39 444.54 A: there's i think there's some- something like on 

444.65 448.27 A: you can block t._v. channels and that there's probably 

449.00 451.24 A: (( something you can use to block )) 

450.04 457.15 B: i know there is software out there yeah for ah preventing them from getting to porn sites and that kind of thing um 

455.24 456.15 A: (( yeah )) 

457.77 467.61 B: (( but ah yeah i i don't know tha- that's -t's interesting and ah a- actually ah it's kinda piqued my curiosity on kinda like [mn] i'm going to go to )) 

461.57 462.86 A: mhm 

467.63 472.08 B: [mn] a couple of my friends that have kids and ask them about that [laughter] you know because 

469.91 478.13 A: yeah [laughter] [laughter] because i would be i would be a nervous wreck that would be a full time job just [laughter] always peeking in and seeing what they were [laughter] 

477.65 479.71 B: yeah yeah 

479.76 488.46 B: but tha- yeah that is interesting and ah and and i just don't know i mean how [mn] like different school systems how how they differ as far as [mn] 

488.34 497.60 B: access to computers and do does does each kid have one or is it just one per classroom and you know what kind of time kids actually get to spend on them okay 

494.47 495.45 A: (( yes when )) 

497.51 508.09 A: i was there they pretty much they had a computer class every day that they all went to in the lab and then i think in the classroom they had one computer but it was more like 

508.65 513.41 A: like when they had like their free time there were different stations so they could go you know to the 

513.34 525.64 A: arts and craft station or they can go to the computer they had just that they didn't have internet access in the classroom and so they could just have their different software on there so they could you know work on their story or you 

515.96 516.97 B: mhm 

524.89 525.94 B: (( oh okay )) 

526.12 527.60 A: (( know play a math game or something )) 

526.93 529.26 B: and this was you said second graders 

528.78 530.45 A: this was second grade yeah 

532.85 534.94 B: okay that's interesting and and how long ago was that okay okay 

534.86 536.47 A: (( this was )) 

537.41 537.97 A: (( [mn] )) 

538.14 542.81 A: i graduated at college in ninety five so like ninety six 

544.48 546.64 A: (( ninety six ninety seven it )) 

547.43 549.04 A: (( seems like a long time )) 

549.13 549.84 A: (( ago )) 

549.26 554.48 B: yeah [laughter] well in the computer world it is a long time ago 

549.88 552.08 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

554.12 555.55 A: (( it really is [laughter] )) 

555.12 560.89 B: i mean it's amazing this stuff they a- actually have on cell phones now and you are able to access the internet and 

558.56 559.86 A: mhm 

562.13 566.03 B: um you know you wonder where it's going to keep evolving to and 

565.99 570.77 A: oh yeah oh yeah it's impossible to keep keep up to date and keep equipment up to date my husband he 

570.93 579.15 A: does a lot of programming stuff and that and he's constantly buying new equipment and everything [laughter] he now wants a new some kind of new software and that 

575.38 576.65 B: mhm 

578.46 582.15 B: yep yep yeah i know how that is too [laughter] 

588.36 589.99 B: (( well )) 

591.10 595.29 B: um i'm trying to think of what else i could say about computers in education [laughter] 

594.42 596.57 A: (( yeah ah um [mn] ))
