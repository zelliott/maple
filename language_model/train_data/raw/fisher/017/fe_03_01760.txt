0.36 1.43 B: [noise] hello 

0.97 2.93 A: hello my name is paula 

2.72 4.87 B: paula hi i'm petra 

4.71 5.53 A: hello 

5.55 8.11 B: okay um is this your first time doing this 

7.84 8.95 A: yes 

8.56 10.94 B: oh okay this is my second time so 

11.09 12.13 A: [laughter] 

11.30 12.41 B: okay 

12.68 15.75 B: so what are your opinions on 

15.80 19.73 B: foreign relations specifically with regard to threats to the u._s. 

20.41 21.48 A: well 

21.98 25.65 A: i don't really believe that there are threats to the u._s. 

26.02 28.14 B: mhm interesting why 

28.56 32.37 A: i think that i think that the president was behind it 

32.58 34.01 B: the president was behind 

33.76 34.63 A: uh-huh 

34.74 36.41 B: (( it ah what specifically )) 

36.86 40.81 A: i think he was behind the whole thing as far as the trade centre went 

41.01 48.34 A: and i think that his whole whole actual agenda was to bring us in- into this war 

48.66 52.48 A: his dad couldn't kill hu- hussein and he's now he's trying to 

53.10 60.23 B: oh okay i do definitely agree with you on the he's definitely trying to follow up on daddy's mission 

60.07 61.17 A: yeah 

60.47 70.26 B: [laughter] i'm definitely with you on that one but i do think there are some threats to the u._s. not specifically maybe a whole countries but um but um 

69.31 70.40 A: yeah 

70.25 76.82 B: i think that i i'm not american by the way i'm canadian i think you guys have ah 

76.93 79.74 B: have riled up a few people here and there 

79.37 83.98 A: mhm yeah that they probably have [noise] i mean 

81.99 82.85 B: (( [laughter] okay )) 

84.32 88.10 A: i don't necessarily know that bin laden and his group is one of them 

88.25 91.75 A: to me i think it was awfully weird that they thought that he um did it 

91.77 103.40 A: they found out so quickly that their group was behind it i mean it was like the first day or the second day that they knew that information already of who did it who was behind it there's no way they could have found it that quickly 

103.08 111.52 B: okay so you think in general that um are you speaking specifically um to the more recent things 

111.08 113.26 A: well like the nine eleven bombing i 

112.64 113.89 B: okay okay 

113.28 115.37 A: don't think they could have found it that quickly 

115.05 116.14 B: (( mhm )) 

116.36 121.07 B: all right all right um i don't know um i feel like ah 

121.83 129.45 B: ah the s- the u._s. has well not only the u._s. i think that most relations between 

129.57 133.12 B: different countries are somewhat strained 

133.35 134.45 B: like i mean 

134.60 135.95 B: ah even 

136.23 138.81 B: i feel like britain is pretty much like ah 

139.13 142.59 B: ah your lackey [laughter] like a u._s. type 

142.87 145.43 B: if the u._s. says something britain will follow 

145.40 147.51 A: yes that probably is true 

147.05 160.12 B: [laughter] i kind of also think ah canada we we tend to be kind of neutral but i think we will pretty much go with you guys on most things as well um but i think there are like quite a few other ah 

160.45 162.38 B: groups maybe even 

162.53 173.04 B: smaller groups within other countries that do pose well you know what i don't even know if i'm sure about that if ah other groups really pose a significant threat to the u._s. because i feel like 

173.32 184.09 B: you guys [mn] um spend a lot of money on weapons a lot of money on defence and in general if there's problems they tend to be in other countries and not on your own soil 

184.28 186.92 B: um but ah 

184.33 185.65 A: yeah 

187.21 193.34 B: this recent thing did kind of bring it home so you think it's more like a conspiracy type 

192.73 193.55 A: yeah 

193.76 196.03 B: ah issue all right 

195.34 201.21 A: i do i think that the president had had no idea that the towers were going to crumble like that 

200.54 201.32 B: okay 

201.34 205.67 A: and he so he was thinking he was going to renew the faith of americans 

205.76 211.78 A: because of the way all the scandal that clinton had caused people had thought the government was a was a 

211.90 212.63 B: okay 

212.73 218.51 A: was just kind of a shambles and a mockery this is his way of renewing the faith of the american people 

218.46 229.45 A: he just had no idea the two the two buildings were going to crumble the way they did and cause chaos and when he did he shot that they shot that plane plane in pennsylvania out of the sky when he realised how many people it had killed 

230.22 232.17 A: so he couldn't go cause more 

232.36 233.13 B: (( mm )) 

232.86 238.13 A: he had no way probably figured it would only kill a couple hundred people you know the people in the plane 

238.15 245.08 A: were hit at and three floors around it had no idea it was going to kill thousands the way it crumbled 

244.50 245.73 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

245.90 250.79 B: so um let me think um do you think al qaeda is a myth 

251.88 256.87 B: or do you think they really exist and they're really um anti u._s. 

257.50 261.52 A: well they are they probably exist the things they're probably um 

262.78 267.77 A: probably on them you know as far as they went over there and made everybody mad 

267.47 268.23 B: okay 

268.83 273.42 A: i mean so yeah they are kind of a risk now because they've 

273.71 278.88 A: made everybody else mad who knows hussein could be hiding there for all we know 

275.34 276.19 B: okay 

278.97 280.00 B: (( [mn] okay )) 

279.31 280.63 A: we're not really 

281.09 284.07 A: bombing there and he's 

284.76 288.03 A: they have not found any hard core proof that he is dead 

287.77 289.14 B: right right 

289.55 290.78 B: um 

290.96 292.41 B: (( ah )) 

291.56 303.88 A: and i honestly believe that when i will be amazed as can be when they call the war over and bring all of our troops back if he don't pop back up and i wouldn't doubt he'll pop back up with another terrorism of some sort 

299.93 300.61 B: (( right )) 

303.63 304.50 B: okay 

304.55 305.95 B: (( okay um )) 

305.89 309.45 A: we will be lucky if they don't send a bomb over and blow half the united states up 

310.07 311.46 B: do you think that's ah 

311.47 312.44 B: (( um )) 

312.70 314.77 B: do you think that's something that really could happen 

315.30 316.74 A: i would think so 

316.51 317.34 B: okay 

317.59 323.64 A: because i mean somebody does you wrong you are going to want to do them wrong that's the way of the world 

323.19 324.99 B: mhm 

325.01 330.46 A: even though two wrongs don't make a right so i don't really believe in that they should be at war 

330.15 330.96 B: okay 

330.89 334.04 A: because two wrongs don't make a right 

332.98 333.82 B: okay 

334.87 335.94 B: um 

334.97 341.50 A: i mean even if they did do the do the nine eleven thing and stuff that was wrong why should we go over there and do them wrong 

336.97 337.86 B: right 

341.71 342.98 B: (( okay [mn] )) 

342.14 344.33 A: (( i think what that's not what )) 

344.49 348.45 A: it's intended to be and that's not the way the bible explains it to be 

348.37 350.69 B: okay um you know 

349.81 355.94 A: even though i'm not a very religious person i do believe somewhat that you shouldn't do somebody wrong just because they did you wrong 

355.83 356.68 B: okay 

356.84 361.63 B: um you are one of the few people who actually takes that point of view 

361.64 366.68 B: that i have spoken to so far um just in general on the topic um 

366.79 367.82 B: (( ah )) 

368.91 371.39 B: (( what about um )) 

372.44 380.82 B: so you think that ah it was kind of a set up but that now it's a possibility that there's a bigger threat to us because of that 

380.70 387.39 A: well yeah i mean it might have been his whole intention was probably to bring us into the war 

381.63 383.08 B: okay so 

387.16 387.95 B: okay 

387.63 392.02 A: and the whole nine eleven thing was just his way of getting all the people on his side 

392.60 393.26 B: (( okay )) 

393.21 395.25 A: so that we would go along with that 

395.28 396.06 B: (( okay )) 

396.46 408.26 A: 'cause there were so many people that were against the against the presidency and all that because of what clinton did before all this happened now they have to now they look at us well we have to rely on our presidents to protect us from terrorist threats 

408.41 409.30 B: right 

408.62 412.20 A: they have a choice because they are scared where else are they gonna turn 

412.27 413.18 B: (( mm )) 

413.88 415.57 B: (( what do you think ah )) 

416.11 419.61 B: about what we can do now to kind of 

419.78 425.17 B: ah get rid of the threat that exists now um if we can do anything at all 

425.33 426.24 A: um 

426.94 430.39 A: other than absolutely finding out for sure that they have killed 

430.59 432.63 A: saddam and all his people 

432.16 433.05 B: mhm 

433.12 436.07 A: i don't think there is anything they can really do about it at this point 

436.07 437.47 B: okay [mn] 

436.74 440.96 A: i mean they have to make sure they make good relations with whoever it is still 

441.11 444.84 A: still alive and make sure that the other ones 

442.27 443.13 B: right 

445.16 448.17 A: are silenced in some sort of way 

448.48 449.43 B: okay 

449.35 454.75 A: i mean and there's always gonna be a ter- terrorist threat of some sort from somewhere they're 

454.97 455.84 B: right 

455.54 458.20 A: just weirdos [laughter] 

456.58 462.19 B: right right um a lot of people argue in some of my classes that um 

462.33 464.14 B: a large portion 

464.22 473.51 B: of terrorists are from middle eastern countries and that here you have a general anti u._s. sentiment to begin with 

473.56 482.29 B: and that they in general pose the biggest threat to the u._s. but um a lot of people don't talk about north korea too much even though um 

482.45 490.31 B: they um every once in a while wag in front of everybody's face that they have or are working on um 

490.64 502.55 B: obtaining nuclear capabilities and um that some people have argued that they are a bigger threat than anything and um no one is really looking at them too much either so i wonder about that 

502.82 506.69 A: yeah i'm not really sure i mean i don't know a whole lot about 

506.87 512.03 A: a whole lot of about the world events when it comes to a whole lot of 

510.10 510.92 B: okay 

512.42 521.87 A: different things i have never followed a lot what goes on in the world until they until they brought us into the war and that's pretty much where i started really following what was going on 

513.11 514.24 B: okay okay 

515.71 517.15 B: (( oh okay )) 

521.50 522.52 B: (( oh okay )) 

522.72 523.57 B: okay 

522.83 536.66 A: only because i sometimes i travel to state capitals and things and i keep track of that just because i was afraid to go to the state capital which i was supposed to do when they brought the war on i was scheduled to go down there that day when it started and i turned it down 

530.57 531.86 B: right 

532.94 533.76 B: okay 

536.87 537.83 B: okay 

538.35 545.57 A: and they wanted me in the state capital if they're gonna bomb somewhere they're gonna bomb the state capital than some flaked out place like indiana to 

544.92 547.31 B: right yeah makes sense right 

545.81 547.32 A: to just make a point 

548.50 549.53 B: mhm 

548.50 549.51 A: (( it will )) 

549.53 554.73 A: be like oh there ain't nothing there but a bunch of hicks let's bomb that place that will mess 'em up 

553.06 554.18 B: so you think 

554.46 556.62 B: you think we are vulnerable right now 

557.69 562.38 A: until i would think so until they can actually show proof that they have killed 

563.18 564.43 A: (( saddam )) 

563.79 564.62 B: okay 

565.05 568.60 A: i would say they were very vulnerable they have already lowered or 

569.08 573.83 A: they have lowered our elevated status that we had as a terrorist threat 

573.39 574.29 B: mhm 

574.02 578.97 A: so there's no there's no protection that somebody from over there can't get in here 

578.72 579.72 B: right 

579.77 585.15 A: i think when in doubt with this protection going on saddam can disguise himself and walk right through in our country 

584.96 585.88 B: right 

586.27 587.10 B: (( right )) 

586.28 596.90 A: if you have no sure they have killed his sons and all this stuff but i'm sure he was aware that all that was gonna happen before he didn't surrender to begin with it wasn't like he wasn't actually warned 

596.86 599.29 B: right right right good point 

598.56 599.89 A: he doesn't care if i
