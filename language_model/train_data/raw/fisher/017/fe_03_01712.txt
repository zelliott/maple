99.35 100.08 B: (( yourself )) 

99.86 111.04 A: i guess i'm [mn] i'm probably more concerned about north korea and what they're going to do with their nuclear weapons um i i don't 

111.75 125.80 A: i don't follow what's going on very of- um a whole lot but i do know that there's been some concern about whether or not um it sounds like they're starting to activate their nuclear weapons stores and to start to produce nuclear weapons 

124.91 125.60 B: (( [noise] )) 

126.57 131.63 A: um and that's of a concern to me i guess 

131.79 138.17 A: i'm not so concerned about iraq anymore since we've gone in and supposedly 

138.18 142.05 A: eliminated saddam hussein but um 

142.82 154.73 A: i don't know the from what i've read you're correct that they it doesn't seem like they treat their people well especially the women um and there are i don't know the stores of 

154.96 157.39 A: of chemical weapons um 

157.48 166.15 A: i guess i'm actually more concerned about the damage they're inflicting to the national treasures and and all the looting and pillaging that's been going on 

166.08 173.66 B: yeah i've heard about korea too but i didn't think it set you know i didn't really pay attention really about 

174.36 177.76 A: no it seems like everyone's been focusing on iraq 

177.23 184.96 B: it yeah right yeah but i would hate you know if they were to open those stores what would happen 

185.43 193.96 B: that's a big concern we should be having [noise] instead of this iraq business if they have done away with saddam or whatever they have done 

194.06 194.91 A: mhm 

194.98 196.75 A: or they can't find him anyway 

196.60 200.08 B: yeah like they can't find bin laden so

203.57 204.72 A: um 

204.92 209.49 A: are you concerned do you think because our troops are still over there or 

208.80 209.56 B: (( yes )) 

209.92 215.87 B: yeah people are dying every day over there and i don't you know casualties are one thing 

216.78 218.16 B: but being 

218.65 221.89 B: some people were saying that it might be like a eight year war

232.93 235.22 A: who are they fighting with right now 

235.68 244.65 B: i i don't know but one of my friends that was in the army he told me that he could gone for up to eight years it's gonna be like a long long term war [noise] 

244.67 250.77 A: [sigh] that's really that's depressing and it's also frightening for anyone who's in the service 

250.40 259.76 B: right you know once the front lines are the plan [noise] is then other people have to go to the front lines and they could be killed and yeah it's 

260.26 263.27 B: a lot of casualties a lot of people dying 

263.08 264.62 A: mhm

283.30 284.22 A: mhm 

284.76 285.75 A: um 

286.35 288.67 A: do you think that having the services 

288.97 291.58 A: does that help you i mean how do you 

291.60 295.27 A: do you worry about this daily is it something that concerns you 

294.41 306.46 B: no i don't worry about it daily because i believe that um god has it planned out for us in the end i mean you know i can't worry about it daily because i know a couple of people that are over there 

306.52 307.92 B: and so i 

308.25 308.83 A: (( [noise] )) 

308.73 310.69 B: i think about it often 

310.76 311.82 A: you do 

311.75 312.79 B: yeah 

312.86 316.22 B: (( like all the people that are still over there in iraq [noise] i )) 

316.33 318.18 B: hope they're okay 

318.95 321.34 A: yeah you you do that's 

321.35 327.01 B: the thing i think about is if the nuclear bombs were to come over here what would happen to us [cough] 

329.75 335.64 A: it it's almost frightening to think about it's almost too much to more than you can think about 

334.74 337.58 B: (( [noise] right )) 

337.85 338.64 B: (( so )) 

338.87 341.71 B: (( it's really kinda depressing in )) 

342.06 343.02 B: a way 

346.04 350.86 A: are there any other countries that you can think of besides iraq and north korea 

350.62 352.15 B: (( no not really )) 

352.79 355.32 B: the people that's sided with iraq 

356.57 363.79 B: (( there was a list of them and i can't even remember who they were like i said i don't pay attention to that part of it really i just )) 

364.41 367.19 B: (( try to see if everyone's okay )) 

367.26 368.16 A: mhm 

368.60 372.62 A: yeah it's kind of interesting to me that you know it's been 

372.83 374.00 A: i don't know 

374.26 379.31 A: it's been a couple of months and all of a sudden no one's worrying about afghanistan and um 

379.35 381.21 A: the leader there any more 

381.33 382.55 B: right 

382.66 383.41 B: (( right )) 

383.46 389.40 B: like they didn't just come over here and destroy people's lives and didn't destroy buildings and 

389.45 391.40 B: cause a lot of people to die 

391.46 400.55 B: and they're not even worried about bin laden anymore they're just worried about the dollar like if he's still out there bin laden's still out there nine eleven still happened you know 

401.19 402.35 A: yeah i don't 

402.48 408.00 A: i don't know why they don't worry about bin laden and his followers because i would think that 

408.13 409.94 A: uh unless he's been 

410.09 417.69 A: unless he's been found and arrested people are going to be you know his followers are going to be out there planning revenge on us 

417.52 418.62 B: yeah 

418.63 420.44 B: (( that's what i was saying )) 

420.74 424.76 B: that kinda bothers me what if something else happened like that could this 

424.77 426.28 B: country handle it it's 

426.99 427.96 A: mhm 

429.13 431.12 B: really sad what happened [noise] 

433.84 436.19 B: i didn't know anyone that was up there 

436.34 441.83 B: and i wish they could come around and pay more attention like how can you go off and get try to 

441.94 445.58 B: capture another country when one country is still 

445.71 454.91 B: you know they still doing what they doing in afghanistan they still ah you know alive and well over there even though they killed killed us 

455.27 461.05 A: yeah it's kind of interesting that we only seem to be attacking one country at a time 

458.99 459.97 B: (( one country )) 

460.73 462.04 B: yeah 

462.48 471.29 A: i don't know if that's because um the government doesn't feel that we can manage more or they feel that only deal with the main threat at one time 

471.72 483.95 A: it i don't understand since they've got all these other countries that they've identi- or there's several other countries that they've identified why they're going ahead and they're they're just focusing on one country at a time if 

476.04 476.98 B: [noise] 

484.20 486.55 A: maybe they're there are 

487.43 491.64 A: underground groups that are going and working 

491.67 497.91 A: maybe they're doing negotiations in north korea and hoping that that will work out and maybe they're doing um 

498.08 498.98 A: (( the )) 

499.38 506.40 A: maybe they've still got armed forces in afghanistan looking for bin laden but they're not telling us about it anymore 

506.28 519.21 B: i hope so 'cause i'm like what if we're over there in iraq all of our troops are over there in iraq and you know something else like not as tragic as nine eleven happens to us something else happens like that 

519.69 525.94 B: [noise] we will what will you do then i mean we were after bin- i mean we were after saddam 

526.13 527.00 B: so 

527.20 529.59 B: what if bin laden attacks again 

529.83 530.80 A: yeah 

530.57 533.70 B: or makes another threat what are we to do then 

534.03 538.79 B: that's what i'm kinda afraid of if something else was to happen like nine eleven or 

540.97 546.25 A: [mn] are you concerned that it might happen near you or that someone you know might be involved or 

545.95 551.03 B: sometimes yeah i am kinda -cerned concerned yeah 'cause we have this 

551.10 554.07 B: station in vesberg that makes missiles 

554.77 555.69 A: okay 

556.59 559.46 B: so it's a real possible you know place 

559.63 561.19 B: you know that terrorists is 

561.25 564.96 B: trying to attack they attack places that you know they 

565.01 567.16 B: (( feel that have a threat to them )) 

567.17 568.15 A: mhm 

568.44 573.94 B: it's a place that makes missiles so they might attack that and if they attack there 

574.18 577.87 B: who knows who might get hurt who could be hurt in mississippi 

578.58 580.65 A: yeah that wouldn't be good 

583.30 584.21 A: (( um )) 

586.88 589.06 A: i don't know we still need to keep 

589.07 590.41 A: talking i guess 

590.19 591.61 B: yeah 

592.98 593.72 B: (( i )) 

594.06 597.58 A: what happened to you after nine eleven did
