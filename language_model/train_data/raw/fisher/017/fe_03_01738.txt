0.00 2.46 A: hi i'm delores who is this 

1.95 3.86 B: hi this is camille 

3.52 4.80 A: (( hi how are you )) 

4.28 5.48 B: (( good how are you )) 

5.11 6.84 A: good where are you calling from 

6.55 8.37 B: massachusetts how about you 

7.85 9.38 A: oh i'm in new york 

8.93 10.90 B: oh you're in new york okay [laughter] 

10.25 11.80 A: [laughter] 

11.66 16.27 B: so the question was what countries do we think are 

13.21 14.19 A: um 

16.07 17.16 A: a threat 

16.37 18.93 B: a threat to the to our safety 

18.65 21.04 A: right what comes to mind is iraq 

21.00 26.26 B: ob- obviously [laughter] and then um next in mind would be syria 

21.93 23.54 A: [laughter] 

26.23 27.38 A: yes 

27.74 30.73 A: and i don't know i can't really think of 

29.39 30.90 B: and north korea 

31.19 32.85 A: okay that's so 

31.68 35.46 B: okay [laughter] they've been in the news recently 

34.83 36.81 A: possibly france 

36.19 48.17 B: and fra- yeah [laughter] well actually this morning i heard just a little blurb on the news that they might be actually coming around to our side i don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing or [laughter] 

47.78 52.15 A: well i guess it wouldn't hurt to have as many countries on our side as possible 

51.69 54.71 B: true i'd rather have them as a friend than an enemy 

54.10 55.30 A: that's true 

55.53 59.69 A: um i can't i don't really think of any other countries though right now as a threat 

60.44 61.25 A: i think 

60.47 67.30 B: no i like you said i mean iraq you know that obviously springs to mind with everything that's going on 

65.34 66.36 A: right 

68.31 71.01 B: and the fact that they've found um 

72.02 77.70 B: not chemical weapons but i know they've found chemicals that could be used as weapons 

77.45 79.61 A: right that would be awful 

78.97 80.57 B: yes [laughter] 

79.78 80.79 A: [laughter] 

81.53 87.19 A: the only thing that scares me really is if they um somehow get into the water supply it 

87.59 89.42 A: wouldn't be too hard to do 

89.18 92.77 B: no it wouldn't and you know like nuclear plants 

92.81 95.10 B: that's another thing that they could target 

94.57 96.12 A: right that's true 

97.13 101.43 A: and i i i'm not i feel pretty safe about the airports at this point 

102.06 104.68 B: i really don't fly so i [laughter] 

104.06 105.53 A: oh you haven't 

104.99 107.53 B: no i i've only flown once so 

105.87 111.80 A: i haven't flown since you know since all this started or whatever like we went to florida last year 

111.85 117.72 A: and we drove and i have three kids so that's uh a feat in in in itself 

116.57 118.68 B: (( mhm yeah [laughter] )) 

117.92 122.47 A: but yeah i wouldn't consider it well maybe at this point i would 

123.14 128.20 A: uh flying i think that the airports have it all under control at this point hopefully 

128.03 133.89 B: yeah i think so from what i understand people that fly you know they have to leave so much earlier 

134.40 135.89 B: you know to go through 

136.00 137.46 B: all the checkpoints 

137.30 138.26 A: right 

137.91 141.90 B: so i th- it is probably safer [laughter] than ever before 

140.03 141.58 A: oh that's good 

142.49 145.54 A: and it's a higher security everything is um 

145.54 148.51 B: well especially i would think in new york [laughter] 

148.24 150.37 A: yeah especially in new york 

149.23 150.09 B: yeah 

150.73 158.55 A: i mean though um with the other thing the anthrax or whatever that was they had that all totally under control too 

158.06 158.89 B: mhm 

158.57 162.29 A: so i'm pretty confident in the in the president at this point 

162.37 164.83 B: i am too i'm i'm behind him i 

165.37 168.76 B: mean i don't like to see anyone go to war but i think that uh 

169.03 174.02 A: sometimes it's necessary right sometimes it's more it's necessary 

169.09 172.46 B: he knows more than we do [laughter] 

173.46 174.41 B: right 

174.72 179.18 B: and i think he's doing what he can to keep us all safe i know 

178.04 181.71 A: right i think so too boy what a tough subject 

181.28 184.07 B: (( [laughter] couldn't they give us something easy )) 

181.80 182.98 A: [laughter] 

183.42 186.64 A: right could we discuss the common cold or something 

185.13 189.27 B: [laughter] is this your first phone call 

188.68 190.72 A: no actually it's my second 

190.16 191.87 B: this is my second also 

192.21 195.15 A: my last topic was on the common cold though 

194.77 196.61 B: (( oh it was okay [laughter] )) 

195.71 197.87 A: that's why it sprang to mind 

197.52 202.96 B: mine was on holidays so [laughter] it was much easier [laughter] 

198.95 203.06 A: oh yeah holidays is kind of cheerful i wouldn't have minded that one 

203.23 207.34 B: well probably this is a subject i'm sure that everyone is talking about 

206.78 215.00 A: right everybody wants to know what the whole country is feeling and stuff it is affecting the kids though i mean i have um young children and they're very aware 

209.41 210.52 B: right 

214.76 216.88 B: now how young are your children 

216.08 218.32 A: they're five seven and ten 

217.86 218.93 B: oh wow 

218.59 220.20 A: and believe it or not 

219.17 221.82 B: well probably de- well definitely i'm sure the ten year old 

221.59 225.16 A: well believe it the seven year old is more than the three of them 

224.27 226.09 B: really wow 

225.22 233.39 A: and the thing with the ten year old now i don't know if you if you have young kids or whatever but they can't even go on a field trip without um 

228.84 230.57 B: i do [laughter] 

233.47 240.91 A: i have to sign like three different consent forms and you know because of the state of the country and it's unbelievable 

235.31 236.25 B: yeah 

238.24 239.10 B: right 

240.58 244.46 B: and they do when they talk and i know they talk it about you know at school 

245.69 247.09 B: on the bus 

246.97 249.78 A: right no i did- they definitely are aware 

249.24 250.77 B: yeah oh definitely 

250.32 251.38 A: (( you know )) 

251.64 257.59 A: i know my seven year old is um sleeping in my room [noise] sometimes if he hears a report [noise] 

257.79 260.54 A: or something like that on television 

259.92 272.08 B: well it's scary for them because you know they they only know so many things you know and we you know we can watch t._v. and read the newspaper and talk to people and they kinda get little bits and pieces 

265.06 266.66 A: (( [noise] right )) 

271.53 274.97 A: and it's like all over the t._v. so you know 

273.68 274.48 B: yeah 

274.59 277.30 B: you have to be careful what you watch you know [laughter] 

276.43 282.16 A: i know i mean you know it could be like if something happens it's on like every single channel 

281.20 290.92 B: exactly and they they did say you know if you are going to watch it try to watch it with them and you know answer their questions and kind of try to relieve you know their fears 

290.25 295.14 A: right and then they have like counselors at school and stuff like that and i'm sure they must have 

293.04 294.27 B: oh that's good 

295.50 298.54 A: you know assemblies where they discuss it or whatever 

298.65 305.03 A: but you'd be surprised i'm really surprised at how um you know how much involved they are in it all 

305.30 307.59 A: i guess they have to be now you know 

307.25 309.90 B: and some day when they're grown up they'll look back at this 

309.81 310.78 A: right 

310.06 323.51 B: you know well i know because i well i'm thirty eight so i [laughter] i don't really remember oh really oh that's neat [laughter] you know i really don't remember much like about the vietnam war and things like that or the korean war 

311.01 312.02 A: right 

313.50 314.65 A: yeah me too 

315.27 316.49 A: (( oh yeah )) 

316.60 317.93 A: [laughter] 

322.10 327.22 A: no i don't think we grew up with war either there was really nothing i mean you heard about it 

323.88 324.85 B: no 

325.43 326.89 B: no we were lucky 

327.01 328.21 B: [laughter] 

327.36 334.08 A: but it was somewhere else and even the other one the desert storm it wasn't real didn't seem real 

328.49 330.03 B: exactly 

333.47 337.79 B: right a a actually a friend of ours um is a marine and he was over there 

337.58 338.87 A: oh really 

338.03 342.94 B: yeah and he came back from afghanistan in february he was over there again um 

343.29 345.71 B: military police this time so 

344.83 345.92 A: (( oh okay )) 

345.74 348.76 B: but he's home so [laughter] 

346.99 348.62 A: oh well that's good 

348.67 354.57 A: that's good because uh i think they have a couple of kids in their class that their fathers are away 

349.42 350.32 B: yeah 

354.14 355.45 B: oh really 

354.82 358.00 A: you know so it really is hitting close to home this time 

357.61 364.19 B: there's not too many we live in a small town so there's not really too many people that have left you know from this area 

363.64 364.64 A: right 

364.24 365.22 B: um 

366.20 367.01 B: but 

369.07 373.25 A: but aside from that like th- things are going along you know 

373.60 376.12 A: as well as could be expected i think 

375.61 383.90 B: yeah you know from what i understand you know it's going along as they had planned and we haven't had too many casualties thank goodness 

382.88 384.97 A: which is a good thing right 

384.33 388.11 B: yeah it was nice to have those p._o._w.s come home [laughter] 

387.13 390.76 A: right exactly and the girl the last one 

391.03 392.13 B: oh the one 

391.04 394.75 A: what was she in the marines i can't remember exactly 

393.35 394.41 B: (( i don't )) 

395.59 398.05 B: know if sh- yeah she might have been i really 

397.22 398.13 A: uh-huh 

398.83 401.05 B: the jessica right 

400.07 401.91 A: oh right that one yeah 

401.97 407.79 A: so it seems to be okay i mean i don't like the pictures of what's going on in iraq right now though 

407.76 409.55 B: oh with the protests and 

408.89 420.89 A: yeah with all the you know their um bombing everything over there and stuff and it's and it's like years ago you didn't see it even if they had like let's say world war two or something like that it wasn't broadcast over the television 

419.80 424.67 B: oh right now i know they're right there [laughter] you can hear the bombs 

421.53 427.39 A: and now yeah i mean there was a reporter on t._v. and he was right there you know 

424.85 425.56 B: [laughter] 

426.39 428.80 B: i know it's amazing [laughter] i know 

427.48 434.65 A: he's like they just bombed down the block from here and i'm like you staying there i don't understand [laughter] 

431.17 437.05 B: and you're still there [laughter] i'd be on the next plane home [laughter] 

434.83 435.90 A: (( [mn] )) 

436.16 445.56 A: it's really something you know on the one hand it's a good thing on the other hand it's a little too much you know we it'd be better i think not to see as much as we do 

444.19 445.80 B: not to see anything at all 

445.76 446.75 A: (( you know )) 

446.72 449.32 B: anyway it's a hard call [laughter] 

447.81 450.92 A: it is it is and you know like a lot of 

450.21 458.84 B: people want it you know some people want to see you know i don't i don't know the first time i i heard the bombs going off it's you know it was very unnerving 

458.55 468.44 A: right i mean and i think maybe they should have like one channel devoted to it so that if you wanted to you could and then if you didn't you know you didn't have to 

462.11 464.91 B: right instead of all over the place 

468.53 470.97 A: i think it should be like that you know 

470.52 471.66 B: right it was 

471.10 474.33 A: also because of the kids it's you know 

472.78 473.77 B: right
