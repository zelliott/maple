93.21 97.51 B: i dated some saudi arabians in in college and yeah they 

97.55 101.74 B: they they're not as as vocal about it but yeah they do 

98.58 100.06 A: (( of views ))

104.73 106.10 A: (( okay [mn] )) 

106.15 111.41 B: or at least they did back then and i i have no reason to think it's changed now you know 

111.34 112.48 A: right 

111.88 112.96 B: um 

114.98 120.98 B: and of course these boys being in the united states were from fairly affluent families back there so 

119.73 120.94 A: (( hm sure )) 

121.70 122.92 B: you know they were 

122.17 125.41 A: (( i didn't realize that they felt that muslims were better than )) 

125.73 129.95 A: all the white i guess christians kind of feel that christianity is the right way 

130.51 135.28 B: yeah i think every religion thinks that they're the right way [laughter] you know but 

134.25 135.07 A: (( right yeah )) 

135.30 139.32 B: but very few of them are willing to kill people over it 

139.46 142.26 A: and that's true especially in this time and age 

141.93 150.51 B: yeah yeah that's you know and that that makes a little i think fanaticism in any form is unhealthy i don't care what form it is 

148.35 149.47 A: yeah 

150.51 161.82 A: yeah i would think that the muslims that i would be worried about in the middle east would be the fanatics because even in the u._s. the christian fanatics they go kill those um doctors who perform abortions and 

155.98 156.77 B: yeah 

161.57 162.55 B: right 

162.29 165.17 A: uh see i would yeah i agree with you yeah 

165.51 166.65 B: yeah i 

166.69 175.12 B: fanatics scare me they're they're kind of homegrown loonies wherever home happens to be [laughter] 

172.97 174.15 A: exactly 

174.42 178.67 A: the reason that i'm so worried about like um syria 

178.61 181.49 A: (( north korea that's it's because )) 

181.41 193.84 A: the leaders that they have i don't know exactly whose side they're on you know what i'm saying are they really trying to protect their people and north korea just wants us to do something about the fact that they're over there making nuclear weapons 

193.85 205.08 A: and the fact that they keep enticing us to do something like daring us i i that's not safe and although i have heard that some of the missiles may be able to reach the far side of california 

193.85 195.11 B: mhm 

205.00 209.03 A: i don't know that i really believe that actually to be true but 

209.10 214.75 A: that's why i'm concerned about those countries but i don't think united states should go into another war at this time yeah 

215.56 223.83 B: yeah i don't i don't think they should either unless we're pushed into it but the problem is now i was a world war two baby 

223.74 224.56 A: (( okay )) 

224.35 226.82 B: and i'm probably a little older than you are 

227.07 228.48 B: but um 

228.78 229.93 B: you know i 

230.14 232.31 B: we won the korean war 

232.56 235.21 B: and then we've lost everything since then 

235.43 236.87 A: (( okay )) 

236.26 246.89 B: and that that you know i mean the united states was for many many many many many years was considered a major political power and or military power 

246.68 247.57 A: okay 

246.95 250.58 B: and i don't think they are anymore and i think that's part of the problem [noise] 

251.39 253.34 A: (( but who could be better than us )) 

253.66 259.05 B: well we've lost [mn] we lost desert storm we lost vietnam 

259.51 262.92 A: now i don't know if anyone would admit to losing desert storm 

262.49 264.95 B: oh we did though you know we did 

264.82 266.91 A: (( now that's the one that was in nineteen ninety one )) 

266.65 267.73 B: uh-huh 

267.74 268.93 A: well bush 

269.55 271.33 B: (( you know i mean )) 

271.63 278.44 A: well no we didn't actually wait desert storm is that one where saddam tried to invade kuwait and we said no that's not going to happen 

278.71 281.31 B: yeah kind of 

280.94 294.90 A: and supposedly they claimed that our only point was to make sure saddam did not invade kuwait and i remember they called that war off kind of early because there was so many fatalities both american and uh the middle eastern people 

294.80 301.41 B: yeah but we we basically lost that i mean we just blew it they they 

299.27 300.07 A: oh 

301.95 304.95 B: sent helicopters then to the desert to 

304.96 313.32 B: pick up p._o._w.s that didn't have sand shields on them and they ended up dumping the people that were going on the rescue mission i it was just it was a mess 

311.82 312.97 A: oh 

313.39 315.71 B: it was a mess 

315.86 317.97 B: and i mean the whole world laughed 

318.79 327.76 B: the whole world laughed vietnam vietnam carried on i mean that was my that my high school and college years and that carried on forever 

325.00 326.62 A: oh 

328.64 332.11 B: and then we pulled out and we had not won we lost 

331.48 333.43 A: right right 

333.39 337.72 B: and not only did we lose over there we lost over here too because 

338.91 343.55 B: when the when the returning soldiers came back they were treated like they were criminals 

343.89 345.06 A: (( i know )) 

343.94 348.38 B: and that made the rest of the world laugh too and i i think all of that together 

349.14 351.94 B: was some jealousy you know um 

352.06 356.38 B: i mean let's face it we have a higher standard of living than any other country in the world 

355.83 357.01 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

357.03 358.07 B: um 

358.41 359.38 B: but i 

360.99 365.17 B: they think we're lazy and weak and in some ways we are 

363.09 364.17 A: they do 

365.25 375.11 A: they do believe that about us my friend and i were just talking about this before this call came through about the unilateralism that america has and why the rest of the world hates us 

375.35 389.08 A: and um my friend her mother was uh in the military and she was stationed in germany and she said in germany they always refer to americans as like uh santa claus because we get everything we want 

386.98 388.35 B: mhm 

389.00 390.15 B: yeah 

390.76 396.04 B: yeah and that's how they see although we don't see ourselves that way [laughter] 

395.04 398.51 A: (( right exactly when we're living it we don't see ourselves that way yeah )) 

397.88 407.01 B: yeah but but you know it [mn] i mean that's that's how the rest of the world looks at us they look at us as weak they look at us as greedy 

407.51 413.37 B: uh they look at us as lazy because we've got the labor unions that that um 

413.13 414.35 A: (( right )) 

414.25 415.07 B: (( you know )) 

415.26 419.58 B: if you're not making eighteen dollars an hour you don't have to work you know 

419.14 420.25 A: right 

419.89 424.51 B: i mean there's there's countries where whole families live on eighteen dollars a week 

423.84 425.68 A: (( right that's true )) 

424.80 426.92 B: and you can't blame them 

427.77 435.51 B: for being jealous i mean you really can't so the the whole trick is that you've got to be a strong enough military power that they're not going to mess with you 

435.21 436.33 A: that's true 

435.91 437.62 B: and we're not anymore 

438.36 450.34 A: i don't know if i would agr- based on what you said you do have some valid points but i just think the world still views us as super power as a military super power but i guess that's what the media feeds me 

446.58 448.33 B: well i'll tell you what 

450.27 458.89 A: the media tells me that the world still views the u._s. as a super power and that just could be the media tricking me because i understand about propaganda 

458.86 461.23 B: but let me tell you why they don't 

461.33 465.00 B: it's because we worry too much about our press 

465.56 469.01 B: we worry too much about how something is going to look 

469.58 471.51 B: so you know we we 

472.65 481.84 B: we bomb iraq and then we send in billions of dollars worth of supplies and food and people and all this to fix what we just broke 

481.68 482.76 A: right 

482.81 485.31 B: you know they wouldn't do that here 

485.46 487.88 A: (( exactly if they were )) 

486.51 490.43 B: they would not do that if they bombed this country they would not do that here 

490.52 491.72 A: right 

491.15 501.91 B: and nobody in the world would expect 'em to we have become very weak in the world's eyes because we want everybody to think we're the good guys and that's where you get into trouble 

501.06 503.86 A: we can't even afford to do it 

503.24 505.58 B: no we can't take care of our own 

505.92 512.30 A: tell me have you heard what they're going to do with that money they found in um in iraq is it four 

510.42 514.60 B: i think they're trying to say it's still not they're still not sure it's real 

514.75 517.14 A: i figured that issue was gonna come up 

516.88 523.55 B: well as well hidden as it was i'm sure it's real and i'm also sure it's gonna disappear somewhere 

523.06 524.27 A: uh-huh 

525.27 529.76 A: (( yeah i figured that issue was gonna come up i figured they were gonna try and say it was counterfeit yeah )) 

529.33 530.53 B: mhm 

530.69 536.77 B: i think they're already working on that [laughter] but uh 

533.29 534.29 A: yeah 

536.69 545.86 B: yeah i you know we we worry way too much about what the rest of the world thinks about us i mean i have no problem if the rest of the world thinks that we're jerks 

545.89 549.75 B: because you leave jerks alone because they'll kick your butt you know 

548.90 549.70 A: right 

550.47 551.39 B: um 

551.63 555.31 A: (( how do you feel about how the president's portraying this country ))

562.19 565.35 B: he's being a little politically correct for me too 

565.21 565.98 A: (( okay )) 

567.23 574.00 B: i mean you know it's it's it's his orders that are sending all this money and all this foreign aid over there and i 

572.03 574.40 A: (( right exactly ))
