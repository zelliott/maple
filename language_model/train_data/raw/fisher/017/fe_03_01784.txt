0.00 1.79 B: (( [noise] hi my name's tammy )) 

1.23 2.79 A: hi i'm melacca 

1.90 2.46 B: (( [noise] )) 

2.78 3.93 B: how are you 

3.83 5.10 A: good 

4.12 7.97 B: (( [noise] ah have you done this a lot before or is this one of your first times too )) 

7.51 8.95 A: this is my first time 

8.48 21.18 B: okay [laughter] um actually i use i'm i'm do- i'm a stay at home mom i have two kids and um [noise] and i use the com- my computer a lot because i do i'm a student of ashworth college 

20.88 21.93 A: right 

21.27 23.02 B: [noise] so i do home study 

23.14 23.74 A: (( m- )) 

23.17 25.87 B: [noise] and oh god it's such a help 

25.88 32.66 A: yes i thi- i don't know i think um computers although i don't really agree in television 

32.44 33.76 B: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

32.73 40.84 A: a lot i definitely ah agree using computers a lot because there's just so much internet connections that you can make 

40.05 51.23 B: [noise] right definitely um see it's like i i don't know how other ah distance learning programs mine i go on do my test i get the results from my test the same day 

51.16 52.12 A: right 

51.74 62.55 B: [noise] which is convenience is wonderful and then it helps with research projects [noise] you know the only downside is there's so much trouble you can get into with a computer [sigh] 

62.07 63.37 A: like what 

62.95 67.18 B: ah well i was [noise] i was actually looking for um 

67.28 71.77 B: work at home programs and got sucked into something i didn't need to get sucked into 

71.75 72.89 A: right 

71.87 78.22 B: [noise] i've got customers now ah clients of a company now coming after me because they never received their product 

77.83 78.73 A: huh [mn] 

78.61 83.56 B: so y- it can [noise] it it it definitely helps but it can also be a major hindrance 

83.60 95.85 B: 'cause there's just [noise] and you know i'm twenty three years old so i'm got that [noise] naivety still of well everybody's inherently good [noise] and you can get sucked into so many scams that way 

87.79 88.93 A: right 

92.44 93.56 A: right 

95.98 100.61 A: yeah but i definitely think that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages because um 

100.52 105.18 A: just thinking if i i- if i was going to have kids and try to home school them 

102.69 104.16 B: [noise] 

104.95 115.80 A: i could take them to different the different libraries around here there's the u. penn library that we could go to and there's so many databases on the u. penn library site and so many different 

110.67 111.85 B: right 

114.31 115.13 B: [noise] 

116.51 119.86 A: programs for kids in the free libraries 

117.57 119.18 B: oh yeah definitely 

119.69 126.85 B: [noise] definitely um and [noise] i mean the only downs- the only real downside i see to even having computers at school 

126.73 136.60 B: is that the kids will tend to rush through their school work to get to the computer you know and may not be the quality that the teachers and the parents want out of the child you know 

137.04 147.76 B: but i mean it c- it's got so many and like you said you know benefits definitely outweigh the risks because there's so much more they can learn from it that they wouldn't have access to just by looking in a book 

147.49 151.49 A: right and they might not necessarily like really 

147.77 148.63 B: (( [noise] )) 

151.66 166.21 A: take advantage of computer time in schools because there computer access is so available now and so readily accessible that it's not as exciting as it once was it's more of an everyday activity 

157.82 159.33 B: yeah 

165.22 174.29 B: [noise] yeah true and it's it's hard to think of [noise] it that way you know 'cause g- and i remember elementary school you know you got like maybe an hour a week you know 

174.03 182.03 A: mhm i'm twenty i'm twenty six and so i mean and my brother is fifteen and he just was born on the computer 

179.78 183.33 B: it's just all over the place anym- [noise] right right 

182.69 187.28 A: you know and his everyday activities and you know his everyday 

187.65 189.98 A: school work is on the computer 

187.93 190.68 B: [noise] life revolves around it 

190.66 196.37 A: it's not really an issue anymore it's more like a necessity almost 

192.84 194.47 B: [noise] right 

195.79 199.20 B: oh yeah [noise] it's and ugh 

199.45 210.35 B: got tongue tied for a second [laughter] but th- you can learn so much more with it too i mean you there's kids now that god they know more than most hackers do about computer programming you know 

210.00 212.27 A: right it yeah 

210.42 214.07 B: [noise] and it's just from being on and familiarity 

213.69 220.14 A: right and the other the other good thing about it is there's international news that you can get at your fingertips 

219.36 221.10 B: [noise] oh yeah [noise] 

220.31 226.13 A: kids can use newspapers but computers can be p- um news can be posted 

226.21 232.37 A: you know every three minutes you know there can they kids can be in their schools and um 

226.65 229.70 B: immediately [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] 

232.48 234.24 A: learn you know 

234.50 243.42 A: different links and different articles and you know by going onto independent media sites and they're constantly updating their sites 

243.23 245.32 B: (( right [noise] )) 

244.02 248.14 A: so you can like immediately have all the news in the world 

247.76 256.74 B: oh yeah i mean i [noise] there i think also that i mean granted the internet's a wonderful thing but you gotta back it up with educational programs also you know 

256.79 263.96 B: [noise] um because i mean there's so many pro- like tutoring programs that are geared even towards three year olds now you know 

256.81 257.66 A: right 

264.17 268.63 B: it's i bought my daughter the reader rabbit program and she's fi- four you know 

268.40 269.27 A: mhm 

268.79 273.97 B: and it it really it helps to build [noise] it start- it's a wonderful starting block 

274.09 279.70 B: because it starts out it starts them out with like your general word families and builds up from there you know 

279.51 280.42 A: right 

280.62 290.72 B: [noise] and it's i- it's a definite advantage because it helps them to learn things a little bit more quickly and they are a little more prepared when [noise] they go into school because school now requires so much more 

290.94 293.29 B: than they did when we went to school you know 

292.91 295.20 A: yeah and it requires a lot more um 

294.64 300.63 B: kids are required to [noise] know how to write their name know their name address phone number by the time they start kindergarten now 

300.54 301.46 A: right 

301.49 303.69 A: that's another thing the 

302.77 303.92 B: [noise] 

303.63 308.33 A: whole job world is all computer literate you know not like it was when 

306.11 307.08 B: (( oh yeah )) 

308.12 319.31 A: you know we are both in our twenties so it really wasn't that way before it there was computers but when we started you know you didn't necessarily have to be computer literate once you get out of school you have to be computer literate 

308.61 310.88 B: (( [noise] )) 

312.79 315.76 B: [noise] 

315.95 317.72 B: (( right a- )) 

317.88 325.74 B: [noise] oh yeah [noise] the- there's so much more like they are expected to learn now 'cause society's just so technologically advanced now 

325.72 326.54 A: right 

326.70 334.21 A: i mean no matter where you go there's going to be some even in arts fine arts there's all types of art programs on the computer 

332.99 335.54 B: right like t._a._d. [noise] and stuff now 

335.67 339.51 B: your engineering people have their computer aided drafting you know 

339.18 341.26 A: right i mean there's just 

341.87 347.69 A: too many things that are assisted by a computer i mean it but like you said there should be supplemental programs 

347.99 349.91 A: besides computer work 

348.77 349.80 B: (( [noise] )) 

350.04 350.85 B: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

350.20 352.19 A: you know definitely 

352.31 353.43 A: you know 

353.90 365.22 B: [noise] well now that's the one [noise] thing i think i i see people getting away from you know is a- all internet and not so much programs anymore you know or if they have programs it's just games 

365.25 366.20 A: right 

365.96 373.04 B: i mean [noise] and you can use your hard drive and your main system for so much more than internet and games 

372.93 373.85 A: right 

373.56 387.51 B: and i bought my husband's from mexico he doesn't speak english real well so i bought him the um the e._s._l. instant american english you know [noise] an- and you can use it to learn things other than having to be on the net you can go on any time 

381.80 382.72 A: right 

387.75 391.12 B: and just pop in the disk and you're there you know [noise] 

390.13 391.45 A: yeah 

391.15 397.16 B: which is a major convenience thing if you want to fork out forty fifty bucks for a program sometimes you know [noise] 

396.11 397.06 A: right 

397.21 401.35 A: that is very convenient and then there's [noise] free tutorials on the web too 

400.99 404.84 B: oh yeah there's the [noise] what is it the video professors now 

401.50 402.51 A: free 

404.80 411.07 A: free language tutorials free science tutorials there's a bunch of different free tutorials on the net 

410.85 413.00 B: and learn [noise] to type stuff an- 

413.04 418.30 B: and it's it's a wonderf- it's a wonderful thing it's added it's added more things to learn than 

418.80 420.42 B: (( anything you know )) 

420.56 431.85 A: right exactly but then at the same time you know you definitely have to um keep children um interested in reading reading actual books d- doing actual art 

428.07 429.35 B: (( [noise] )) 

430.16 432.24 B: writing [laughter] 

431.91 439.78 A: um met- li- you know helping them you know with work with their hands and with their you know bodies 

437.44 438.54 B: [noise] 

439.29 447.43 B: yeah that's the the one downside to typing i think is that a lot of kids especially ones that have sloppy handwriting stay that way you know 

439.91 441.05 A: and 

447.18 448.12 A: mhm 

447.51 452.08 B: because nobody bothers to work on [noise] their penmanship with them anymore because of computers [noise] 

451.35 452.20 A: right 

452.81 460.71 B: and you gotta you've gotta have clear writing especially especially in work depending on what you do you know 

460.37 461.19 A: right 

461.07 466.33 B: [noise] like if a child goes on to be an accountant and they've got these sloppy numbers whose going to be able to read their reports 

466.60 467.62 B: you know 

467.23 468.12 A: right 

467.64 477.41 B: and so [noise] i mean you there's still a certain amount of manual work that has to be done that i think maybe the computer takes a little bit away from you know 

477.14 478.43 A: right i mean 

478.39 485.20 A: it is still sitting in front of a television it's still sitting in front of a screen where the messages are just being 

484.99 497.42 A: you know it's still a passive passive activity you know there's a lot of information flow that's going through that you are getting a lot of stuff out but it still is a passi- passive activity no matter 

487.92 489.23 B: (( right )) 

495.40 498.45 B: [noise] you don't have to put much effort [noise] forth 

498.77 500.48 B: to get it anymore 

500.43 511.67 A: right and so i mean definitely it should be supplemented with um all kinds of other activities you know and [laughter] going outside doing outdoor activities everything 

501.66 503.53 B: [noise] [noise] 

511.59 524.01 B: oh my goodness my four year old went outside yesterday and we let her play outside by herself for the first time and she came in filthy [laughter] you know and it's [noise] just and that's another thing you know you gotta make sure there's sufficient sunlight time you know 

523.62 524.84 A: [laughter] right 

523.94 532.61 B: [noise] otherwise you'll have these kids that are [noise] white as a ghost because [laughter] they spend too much time either in front of the computer [noise] or just indoors in general and that's only 

532.96 540.49 B: b- b- the real bad thing i see about it that e- even the school system period anymore you know [noise] kids have p._e. once a week now 

537.94 538.85 A: yeah 

540.17 547.66 A: right yeah there's so many there's so many kids that um because it's such an everyday activity and everyday um 

541.03 542.29 B: (( a- [noise] )) 

547.12 549.72 B: [noise] 

547.77 552.28 A: um learning tool computers it's um it's 

552.53 556.30 A: [mn] there's less activity of other things 

555.74 558.95 B: almost contributes to child obesity problem you know 

558.65 564.81 A: right and it contributes to like you know also like interpersonal and social awareness 

561.85 563.05 B: [noise] 

563.62 570.29 B: [noise] [noise] oh yeah definitely [noise] i think that's a lot of why there's more skids now in like e._s._e. programs like um 

565.12 566.09 A: and 

570.38 573.71 B: what the heck was it called e._h. for social personally you know 

573.26 574.11 A: right 

573.99 582.35 B: [noise] and i i think that just the isolation's so much more because in a lot of schools yeah they do group projects but where are the group projects on the computer 

581.85 582.78 A: mhm 

582.71 592.53 B: [noise] and it just it takes away so much you know ch- kids don't learn a they don't e- they don't learn their study skills anymore they don't learn their interaction really much anymore 

591.74 599.89 A: group participation inter- intrapersonal and interpersonal skills you know coordination of events and you know org- 

592.69 594.53 B: [noise] exactly
