0.58 3.04 A: hi [cough] hi is anybody there 

2.57 4.58 B: yes hi i'm here [mn] 

4.95 8.50 A: okay i guess we're supposed to talk about foreign relations [noise] 

8.38 12.95 B: yes and if any we believe any countries are a threat to u._s. safety [mn] 

13.09 15.89 A: that's right and do you 

16.18 19.93 B: um [lipsmack] yes i do um 

19.01 20.95 A: okay i do too so 

20.10 21.44 B: [laughter] 

21.28 30.58 A: that won't be too hard we're [laughter] but i'm probably more unusual because right now i'm not too trustworthy of france i'm 

30.54 32.53 B: yeah that's a good point [noise] 

31.91 34.39 A: you know that's a good point because 

34.48 46.78 A: all of these compan- these countries that didn't want us to get involved and now all of a sudden they're like oh the reason you didn't want us to get involved was because you've got all your all these ties in there 

47.17 50.78 B: yeah although i don't i don't think of it so much as ah 

47.42 48.22 A: so 

50.83 53.00 B: direct threat to our safety i 

52.97 53.93 A: (( no [mn] )) 

53.63 57.93 B: i think they're you know probably not going to do us any good in the long run but 

57.34 63.15 A: no but [mn] more so of an indirect if they're supplying people that can do direct threats 

63.33 65.14 B: right that that's true 

65.00 66.43 A: you know [lipsmack] 

65.48 66.04 B: (( [mn] )) 

66.64 69.64 A: so what other country do you think of 

69.44 73.43 B: um my big c- concern is um north korea with 

73.77 79.36 B: i think it's north with their nuclear program that they have um [cough] [lipsmack] 

75.22 76.70 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

79.91 82.84 B: it concerns me because i don't 

83.45 87.34 B: think they i think they would do something 

87.56 89.93 B: um more to make a statement 

90.12 92.99 B: than to actually resolve a problem 

92.80 98.00 A: i think a lot of it is that is just making a statement you know 

96.95 97.51 B: (( [mn] )) 

98.10 100.89 A: that they can actually do something 

100.39 101.44 B: yeah 

101.06 107.02 A: it was something that i don't remember wi- who it was that said it but i think it was one of the generals 

107.47 118.74 A: they said well why are you doing that and he says because i can and you know we do we have a lot of power out there but we support so many nations with money 

110.86 112.05 B: mhm 

119.04 119.81 B: (( yes )) 

119.20 121.91 A: and everything it's like 

122.62 124.59 A: ther- there should be no reason 

124.90 132.33 A: i mean i i can't even think of a reason why they came over here in the first place except that they wanted to disrupt us 

132.48 133.98 B: [mn] why who came over here 

134.35 136.71 A: whenever they came over for nine eleven 

136.40 138.11 B: (( oh yeah yep yep )) 

137.49 141.83 A: you know it was just to disrupt us basically 

140.13 141.21 B: yeah 

142.35 150.79 B: well the other thing that i i do think about sometimes is you know a lot of times we think we talk about country and um for us to put this whole country 

150.69 160.54 B: um make a generalization and a lot of times i really think it boils down to individuals in that country um really crazy people who've gotten into a position of power 

160.80 165.22 B: and and yet we talk about the whole country as being against us and 

164.59 168.74 A: [mn] that's true and it's not the whole country it's the people that's in power 

166.54 167.56 B: yeah 

168.70 169.77 B: yeah 

168.81 170.99 A: and you know even when we 

171.43 178.48 A: went into iraq and we didn't occupy it we were liberating it [laughter] even though a lot of people laugh at me whenever i say that 

178.49 184.84 A: but i was watching them on t._v. and you know if we hadn't of won all those people that were out there cheering and everything 

184.93 187.27 A: if we hadn't of won they 

184.96 185.93 B: (( [mn] mhm )) 

187.65 190.30 A: they would probably be st- still be out there cheering 

190.46 191.42 A: for 

191.97 195.05 A: saddam hussein if he was standing in the middle of it 

192.03 194.26 B: yeah [laughter] yeah 

195.31 197.78 A: (( and it's just that they are so repressed that i think they're more so )) 

195.59 196.37 B: (( [cough] )) 

198.00 200.51 A: (( afraid to say what they really you know want that )) 

201.85 206.27 A: (( they don't know what they want [noise] [mn] no they don't um so i guess that's an example where you mentioned france )) 

206.85 209.86 A: (( you know if maybe the whole culture in france might foster that type )) 

211.12 212.73 B: that's possible 

213.84 215.54 B: (( mhm )) 

215.64 217.44 B: i think a lot of um 

217.77 222.84 B: you know a lot of what we perceived to be a threat is based in terrorism i think 

223.04 227.82 B: that's another example where the country's pol- well the country's 

228.18 232.98 B: overall policies and attitudes don't really reflect how much of a threat they are 

233.16 234.40 A: (( of um individual )) 

233.46 235.75 B: or we do to the united states 

235.35 236.44 A: (( activity mm-kay )) 

239.62 240.77 B: (( they don't )) 

242.64 243.79 B: (( that )) 

246.31 247.57 B: could hurt us 

247.48 248.73 A: right 

248.58 262.61 B: just because the culture over there is is anti american i think in general and it might really give people somewhat of a like a pass or permission to or given them a feeling that's if they're going to engage in that kind of activity that's the location to start from 

248.80 249.50 A: and 

263.59 264.98 A: [mn] this is true 

265.12 270.99 A: but i just still feel like you know you did it in my backyard so now you've got 

265.24 266.20 B: (( [cough] [noise] )) 

270.95 280.19 A: me to stop i mean before i was just nice and calm i was really naive to foreign policies and everything before nine eleven 

280.17 281.78 B: well what state do you live in 

281.41 282.90 A: i live in florida 

282.70 283.44 B: oh 

283.57 289.12 A: and i live like in a rural area so you know there's not a lot of 

289.65 298.53 A: of gangs and there's not a lot of violence in our area that we see now my son lives in new york city and my husband's from new york 

297.97 299.20 B: oh 

298.96 303.52 A: so it's like a totally different culture whenever we go up there but i guess 

303.62 305.96 A: you know i'm used to being here 

306.13 311.04 A: and you get to thinking that the whole world is like where you're at and it's not 

311.17 314.24 B: yeah i agree with that because 

311.20 311.76 A: (( [noise] )) 

314.63 318.80 B: i live in michigan and i think 

318.91 321.73 B: that the effects of nine eleven kind of 

322.06 324.65 B: dampened the farther you go from 

324.74 330.20 B: new york city and i i mean i am affected by it but i don't have family members who 

330.53 334.59 B: were directly affected i don't know anybody that was directly affected 

331.68 332.83 A: right 

334.04 338.15 A: i i don't know of anybody that was directly affected either 

338.17 341.00 A: but i know that i was glued to the t._v. 

341.07 342.22 A: and it was 

342.77 349.01 A: i was just in utter shock but then to find out that there's countries where people go through this 

349.05 351.05 A: weekly daily you know 

351.33 361.70 A: these things happening for no reason at all somebody walks into a theatre and blows themselves up i mean that's a stupid statement to make [mn] 

357.56 358.75 B: yeah 

360.62 361.48 B: [laughter] 

361.90 363.33 B: yeah [laughter] 

362.61 369.15 A: you know [laughter] there's gotta be another way besides blowing yourself up to make a statement 

364.19 365.02 B: yeah 

369.23 377.26 A: but unfortunately that you know they've got it in their heads that they're going to go to heaven they're going to get all these blessings and everything and 

376.93 381.09 B: yeah and what whatever it is they're trying to tell us i haven't changed anything it 

380.72 385.98 A: [laughter] i know [laughter] i know it just makes me really hate them more 

381.16 382.80 B: hasn't gotten through to me 

385.75 386.90 B: yeah 

386.22 387.43 A: you know but 

387.47 396.18 A: we have people in our community that our muslim and we have people in our community here that 

396.36 398.63 A: are foreigners i'm not good at 

398.92 403.02 A: looking at somebody and saying oh your pakistan you're from afghanistan 

401.60 402.58 B: oh yeah 

403.27 412.32 A: i mean i can look at you and i probably wouldn't know if you were from germany or the united states until you spoke to me and if you spoke american then i guess you're from the united states 

412.05 413.11 B: mhm 

412.43 416.36 A: but i don't blame these people here i feel sorry for them 

416.30 417.93 B: (( right yeah i do too )) 

417.10 418.91 A: because you know they're 

419.26 422.56 A: those people are portraying it for the whole country 

422.77 424.83 A: you've got one idiot 

425.86 428.93 A: and all of a sudden it's the whole country that's bad 

429.16 437.59 B: [noise] i was thinking about another thing when you were talking um i'm thiry two years old and i remember when i was like a child 

437.50 438.42 A: (( ahah )) 

438.07 452.41 B: or maybe you know like early teens and the big thing you know now the big thing to worry about is terrorism and then it was the big thing was world war three and nuclear war in russia and that was the big scary thing and i remember my parents my dad saying one time 

448.14 449.29 A: right 

452.37 463.46 B: oh he said i don't think we have to worry about those big powers he said i think some little country in the middle east is gonna start something and that's what's gonna that'll cause world war three and 

462.15 466.81 A: more than likely your father was right i probably would have to agree with him 

464.43 465.75 B: well it is 

466.20 469.83 B: yes so twenty years later it's the middle east [laughter] 

469.25 470.91 A: [noise] exactly 

470.33 476.48 B: so and again and no we're not overly concerned with the major powers 

476.18 480.15 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] but see i'm about ten years older than you i'm forty three 

480.37 481.41 A: but 

481.99 485.22 A: when i was in elementary school we had the weekly 

485.42 486.29 A: duck 

486.64 487.97 A: and hide [noise] 

488.05 495.82 A: syndrome thing you know because we were we were in florida and we were afraid that cuba was going to send an atom bomb i mean 

488.15 489.32 B: oh wow 

494.63 495.74 B: oh yeah 

496.61 503.48 A: if they would've blown us up with an [noise] atom bomb there isn't too much that us ducking under our desks really would've done 

502.54 506.32 B: [laughter] [laughter] yeah 

504.16 506.07 A: [laughter] 

506.46 513.94 A: [laughter] so it's just you know if they're going to do it they're going to do it you just have to be right in your life 

514.37 522.35 A: you know to make sure you're doing what you possibly can to keep it you know yourself safe i guess 

514.59 515.69 B: yeah 

522.09 523.08 B: mhm 

523.19 524.26 B: i guess so 

523.28 527.57 A: but i think your dad was right it's going to be the middle east that starts something 

527.92 528.95 B: yeah 

528.84 533.74 A: and it's mainly jealously is the only thing i can think of 

533.80 534.75 B: mhm 

534.13 535.87 A: i mean they have the pow- 

536.58 540.60 A: they they need to be able to provide for themselves 

541.22 544.26 A: [noise] and i think once the other countries 

541.40 542.26 B: mhm 

545.06 547.88 A: can catch up with us socially i guess 

548.48 556.97 A: then maybe things would straighten out but i'm afraid that somebody might come on in with another terrorist act before that does happen 

556.94 558.29 B: mhm 

558.28 563.27 A: did we wander too far off the subject and i'm wondering if our ten minutes are up yet 

562.65 563.52 B: um 

564.08 565.26 B: one more minute 

565.03 567.50 A: oh [laughter] [laughter] 

565.49 566.48 B: i believe 

566.71 569.98 B: and i don't think it's too far off the subject um 

569.70 571.37 A: no i don't think so 

571.84 573.71 A: i don't think so either but 

574.70 579.16 A: you know i think we're looking at syria next i don't think we should go in and try to 

580.35 589.34 A: you know overtake them or whatever like we did with this country but i think turning that little oil pipe off and saying okay fine look at 

589.77 596.69 A: send those people out of there and we'll turn the oil back on i think that was a really good move on our part 

596.33 598.29 B: (( mhm )) 

598.67 599.95 B: [mn] [cough] i was thinking about what
