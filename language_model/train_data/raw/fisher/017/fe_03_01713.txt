58.69 66.36 B: the missiles out in the pacific i think that that's a threat too and i think they're just teasing us saying oh you know what we have power

120.88 126.20 A: they're broken up now well my husband and i were talking about this last night i can't stand it when i can't think of the word 

126.50 127.39 A: um 

128.01 130.30 B: they're more like a um 

131.02 134.30 B: a ruler kind of thing there's like one person 

134.29 135.97 A: yeah dictatorship 

135.31 137.69 B: yeah like a dictatorship and stuff 

137.72 139.34 B: a democracy 

139.48 141.34 B: and yeah i 

140.78 146.25 A: communist that's what i was trying to think communist [laughter] um yeah my husband was telling me

146.54 147.46 A: um 

148.95 154.00 A: what was it that they were communist or the communist party i guess 

153.15 153.92 B: right 

154.21 155.92 A: oh i guess it was korea but 

156.03 157.25 B: (( korea )) 

157.07 159.25 A: i think they do have um 

159.93 163.18 A: re-elections or i thought they did in in korea 

163.68 165.62 A: maybe i'm thinking of another country 

167.63 168.72 B: yeah i 

169.08 170.34 B: i think [noise] 

170.54 173.31 B: are you still there okay 'cause i clicked my phone 

171.31 172.09 A: (( uh-huh )) 

173.57 174.38 B: um 

175.17 180.19 B: i think a lot of those countries that are not really saying anything they're sorta 

180.16 192.43 B: staying back in the shadows i think that maybe they might be a threat but not nothing like huge threat but 'cause they don't we don't really know what they have 'cause they don't talk 

192.77 196.70 B: they're just they keep to themselves and i think if they're threatened they will 

197.01 201.93 B: would react but if people just leave them alone i think they won't react too 

202.02 212.15 A: well according to the u._n. treaty ah there's only so many countries who are allowed to have nuclear weapons and i don't know which ones they are exactly i know we are 

202.52 203.55 B: being [noise] 

212.23 213.34 A: and 

216.24 218.63 A: and i don't know if korea is or not 

218.42 219.87 B: no is russia 

219.89 220.68 A: uh-huh 

220.80 222.65 B: is russia allowed i wonder 

222.55 223.43 A: um 

224.08 231.00 A: i think they are they're bigger but i'm not sure but in since they're broken into so many parts now you know um 

232.96 234.88 A: and each of those countries are 

234.99 237.64 A: separate now you know like poland and 

237.75 238.73 A: um 

239.63 241.62 A: croatia and you 

241.68 244.76 A: know the ones that used to be [laughter] ah yugoslavia 

243.11 246.31 B: the bos- was like bosnia and 

245.69 248.56 A: yeah bosnia there's so many of them i don't even 

249.57 252.18 A: recognize the names you know at this point i 

251.75 252.87 B: right 

252.44 254.87 A: always wanted to go to yugoslavia but 

254.56 258.05 B: oh and [laughter] oh yeah exactly exactly 

255.09 256.52 A: not now [laughter] 

258.24 259.14 B: i just 

259.20 269.18 B: i you know i i think i each i think each individual country it probably has a threat like of it's own but not 

269.21 270.61 B: not like 

270.59 285.07 B: a certain you know like like huge impact like the united states i mean we have tons of troops and weapons and stuff but i think you know some you know you never know like in these small little towns 

280.83 281.62 A: (( ah )) 

285.26 288.18 B: these people might have how to make like 

288.96 296.33 B: like biochemical weapons and stuff like that 'cause you really don't know i mean you never know what's out there 

294.48 295.43 A: (( and i )) 

295.82 299.38 A: it's like ah some of the the arab countries 

299.40 302.68 A: just seem to be threatening us and i i i 

302.86 305.99 A: i wo- really didn't want us to have to go to war but 

306.85 309.11 A: i'm not against it now because 

309.82 312.35 A: you know look what iran did to us 

312.05 313.12 B: right 

312.67 317.90 A: and you know they and and we couldn't do anything back or what we tried to do failed 

317.51 318.56 B: right 

317.97 318.96 A: um 

319.94 324.45 A: i guess bush would of sent the troops in [laughter] and getting their people 

322.48 323.62 B: yeah 

324.86 327.25 A: i don't know if that would been bad i 

328.48 330.28 B: yeah i ah 

330.58 333.72 B: i have relatives over in the war and so 

333.78 335.45 B: i i've always 

334.59 335.64 A: over where 

335.57 337.21 B: over in iraq 

336.62 337.66 A: oh do you 

337.23 350.61 B: uh-huh and i've always been for the war because it made my day when those people and the statue of saddam hussein came down and those people are just cheering like a big relief had been lifted off of them and 

345.55 346.45 A: uh-huh 

350.15 356.07 A: yeah so whoever i talked to yesterday ah they just thought you know we shouldn't have gone in 

355.88 356.86 B: uh-huh 

356.40 361.62 A: to iraq and and she said was saying you know how do you know that those people even wanted 

361.63 363.51 A: help and she didn't think 

363.64 367.03 A: you know when we left that they would probably still just go back to 

367.07 375.08 A: um fighting again and and then the religious leaders would take over and the different sects of the um 

375.72 377.46 A: parts of the religion yeah 

375.76 378.23 B: the muslims yeah 

377.57 383.90 A: and and like she was saying you know how did i know i i think we just had to go in and help them because we could 

383.50 386.68 B: right exactly it's not it's 

384.20 385.07 A: you know 

385.54 386.44 A: and 

386.80 391.64 B: in a way it's like the reversal of david and goliath finally you know 

391.27 392.37 A: yeah 

392.09 398.17 B: it 'cause i mean we in a way in the sense we were the david because 

398.26 399.30 B: we 

399.46 402.36 B: we weren't in there fighting for religion and 

401.66 402.47 A: yeah 

402.40 409.22 B: the goliath was like all muslim and i mean i don't have anything against the religion or anything i mean it's awesome but 

405.12 405.83 A: yeah 

407.57 419.15 A: yeah you know i don't understand why they have to fight within their religions but i think it's more than that i think saddam was look at all the money they found i mean he was just a greedy dictator and 

419.11 425.76 A: and certainly couldn't have been all that religious all of the [laughter] things they were all the booze and [laughter] 

426.01 431.74 A: stuff that his sons had and you know they certainly must not have practiced the religion 

427.97 429.24 B: right 

431.67 438.57 B: exactly and i think you know in a way that's why prob- those countries are a threat because 

438.82 445.72 B: they go along with instead of going along with the religion they go along with like saddam 

445.62 451.03 A: well i think they had to or else i think they they those people are oppressed you know 

450.61 451.70 B: right 

451.10 456.67 A: um and i guess the same could be true in iran but um 

456.95 460.81 A: i think that those people are maybe the whole thing is 

462.67 471.29 A: you know maybe they're the whole religion um i don't know i don't know if there's that many different sects but since it's a whole they're all muslims 

471.49 472.49 A: um 

472.83 479.21 A: you know i guess there's different parts i know there's different parts of the baptist church but we don't go fight each other [laughter] 

478.33 488.62 B: oh exactly and it's just like oh we was watching um my husband and i were watching this um called terror in children and it's where these children all over iraq and iran 

488.77 494.42 B: and it went from how different the muslim religion was taught this one boy 

494.71 499.50 B: he was like i'm gonna go to hell because i'm seeing a woman's face 'cause a woman 

499.74 506.55 B: that was interviewing him 'cause she knew how to speak their language and stuff and he was like i'm going to hell because i see your face 

506.57 507.50 A: (( yeah yeah i )) 

506.69 510.28 B: and then she was and then in ah interviewing another boy from 

510.51 522.00 B: a different part of town and stuff and he was just fine saying you know it's nice to finally see women's faces because you know our our religion's letting us do this and it's i mean you know it's 

522.11 533.09 B: it's amazing how people can have different interpretations of the same thing and i think you know with saddam hussein he made the people believe his interpretation 

533.32 540.07 B: and the same with um osama bin laden he there he was teaching people his interpretation so it was 

540.17 543.85 B: you know it's making it bad and when it's not really 

543.49 552.58 A: think that's too is a threat in these terrorist factions you know all over i think that's the threat i think that's my caller 

550.48 551.41 B: (( oh yeah )) 

552.96 556.64 A: waiting thing but i they said not to answer it so i'm not [laughter] 

556.03 557.12 B: [laughter] 

557.69 559.75 B: yeah i mean i i just 

559.95 564.64 B: i'm like i don't know i just wish i they could get rid of all the terrorism 

564.69 565.82 B: and i mean 

566.01 567.15 B: i know 

566.68 572.22 A: yeah i hope we can get rid of that osama whatever i think i know they're trying to 

567.16 567.91 B: um 

572.06 576.92 B: yep and i and just like saddam hussein they don't know if he's dead yet or not 

573.95 575.31 A: he is the devil 

576.32 577.67 A: where i know 

577.41 580.86 B: and i mean how are we gonna tell if like he has 

579.63 582.17 A: yeah how we gonna find out [laughter] 

581.11 583.19 B: he had there was like seven of him 

582.91 583.85 A: yeah 

583.22 589.01 B: so i mean for all we know he could already be hidden in china 

584.26 585.52 A: impersonators 

588.66 594.65 A: or he could be down in one of those bunkers they say they're like you know a mile down under the ground or something 

594.33 595.48 B: yeah so 

595.40 599.78 A: and and it they can't wouldn't be penetrated by the bombs
