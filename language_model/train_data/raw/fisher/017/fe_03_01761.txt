14.66 15.67 B: um

36.02 36.96 B: yeah

40.66 41.49 B: (( yeah )) 

40.78 50.68 A: um i- you know maybe not soon that they will do anything soon but i'm sure that soon enough they will do something to either us or to south korea or one of their neighboring states 

48.51 49.33 B: right 

50.35 51.19 B: right 

50.90 51.93 A: that will be 

52.42 57.40 A: that will cause us to want to rear up and act again like we did in iraq 

55.74 56.58 B: right 

56.75 57.53 B: right 

57.42 59.66 A: and i also think it's it's 

59.86 66.62 A: with the war in iraq [mn] i think that we're just waiting for another country which is not a good thing [laughter] 

63.41 64.30 B: yeah 

65.67 69.28 B: no i i i agree i feel like that that the country has 

69.37 70.35 B: um 

70.43 78.80 B: well that the gov- that the president has sort of set us up has set us up you know he's like you know if you are not with us you are against us so you know 

72.12 74.40 A: the president exactly exactly the president 

78.90 82.74 B: anybody who makes the first move we are just gonna jump on them 

82.61 89.02 A: yeah 'cause now we have shown our power already so we are ready to you know if if any other countries step out of line 

85.15 86.09 B: yeah 

88.85 89.73 B: right 

89.09 90.66 A: you know we will be right there 

90.12 96.28 B: right what's frustrating to me is that you know we define what out of line is and and that you know it's 

94.26 95.31 A: yeah 

96.14 106.16 B: of course in our best it's it's somehow in our interests to find countries that are out of line so that i don't even know so that the american people will feel safe i don't i don't quite get like what the 

105.79 108.86 A: yeah we're the rule setters of the world 

106.30 107.55 B: strategy is 

108.14 109.55 B: exactly 

108.95 112.44 A: now and i can understand why other countries will be really you know annoyed 

112.16 113.16 B: right 

112.52 123.31 A: at at that fact and i am a little annoyed at that fact myself i mean you know i look at other countries and i think okay would i would i live would i want to be a resident of any other country um 

113.60 114.54 B: yeah 

115.74 116.83 B: yep 

123.43 124.61 A: (( and )) 

124.73 128.06 A: you know nowadays it's a it's little bit harder to 

128.17 130.86 A: to say as you know years ago 

128.93 129.81 B: right 

130.83 143.18 A: you know i'm a democrat so you know whe- when clinton was in office i was like hey yeah you know i'll live in america sure this is great i have money for my education i have money for you know and and he went into 

132.03 133.10 B: yeah 

135.37 136.17 B: right 

136.23 138.40 B: [laughter] 

140.55 141.65 B: (( totally )) 

143.15 147.73 A: bosnia and and really just took care of things without creating this huge media hype 

147.02 151.09 B: that's true that that that he did well yeah i mean [noise] 

151.18 154.88 B: it's funny during the clinton years i i felt i wasn't really paying at- very close attention 

154.93 156.04 A: oh yeah 

155.66 157.16 B: sort of thing for 

157.69 161.39 B: there was stuff we were getting involved in but it didn't feel like 

161.45 171.79 B: we were out of line you know and and yeah people are now saying well bush went ahead and did this without u._n. approval and people are saying that's so horrible but so did clinton 

162.54 163.45 A: right 

171.87 181.70 A: well right and clinton did it without no- not only without u- u._n. approval but without the nation's approval in general and literally it took one quarter of the time 

176.83 178.71 B: right right 

181.34 182.45 B: yep 

181.89 186.05 A: you know more lives were lost but that's because the war had already been going on for so long 

184.57 187.49 B: right it was something that had already started we didn't initiate it 

187.05 192.02 A: right and and no other countries got up in arms about it they're like okay you go in you do your thing 

189.53 190.55 B: yeah 

191.59 192.45 B: right 

192.03 193.77 A: he did it silently 

193.31 194.09 B: right 

193.93 199.07 A: and that what did that caused our economy not to drop 

197.59 198.47 B: right 

199.12 205.64 A: you know and i think that um it's one the other callers i was on the line with was talking about she thinks that russia 

206.01 206.90 B: huh 

206.19 207.61 A: is a 

207.19 208.21 B: is a threat 

208.05 213.88 A: yeah and [cough] i i tended not to agree with her whatsoever because 

213.89 220.90 A: i just think the cold war years are over you know russia is all split up they are not a soviet union any more there are different states 

216.35 217.24 B: right 

218.99 219.87 B: right 

220.27 229.24 B: yeah i yeah i i actually i have actually spent some time in russia i was there for i was there as a foreign exchange student for a month in high school that was ninety 

224.14 225.23 A: oh really 

227.69 228.48 A: (( mm )) 

229.72 230.68 B: four 

230.41 231.37 A: okay 

231.00 232.43 B: (( and ah )) 

233.73 234.88 B: you know [mn] 

235.06 240.21 B: they have so much of their own problems to deal with there [laughter] 

237.41 242.84 A: yeah yeah they're just try- they're just trying to deal with right now the fact that they're a democracy 

241.96 248.89 B: exactly they're just trying to get their economy going and just trying to figure out like this whole you know free currency thing [laughter] i mean it's like 

247.94 249.01 A: right 

248.99 251.03 B: i really don't think 

249.42 252.28 A: and with the euros now coming up they're all messed up 

251.34 253.36 B: exactly exactly 

252.39 257.22 A: so they're not they're not i don't think they're a threat to us at all i mean i know they oppose the war 

256.83 264.52 B: right right but you know there's plenty of countries and you know do we consider france a threat to us no you know what i mean [laughter] 

258.09 260.18 A: they strongly oppose the war 

262.88 268.93 A: right right they just i mean russia didn't want to get involved because now they are a democracy they had too many business deals going on with other countries 

266.83 267.86 B: yeah 

268.18 272.25 B: yeah exactly yep i think i think the whole 

270.12 271.57 A: dangerous 

273.09 277.82 B: the whole iraq thing is interesting thinking about it in comparison with bosnia it's l- 

278.01 278.88 B: i mean 

279.12 282.20 B: i think one of the reasons why there have been so many um 

282.28 294.29 B: you know strong opinions about it just around the world has to do with the fact that you know bush was saying that we're gonna go in there and get rid of saddam because he's about because who knows what he'll do and he's gonna you know 

293.93 296.80 A: right the weapons of mass destruction 

294.26 299.41 B: right invade other people screw up other people whereas in bosnia it was sort of like we are going to go in and 

299.70 305.40 B: help this region take care of whatever you know what i mean like help them figure out the 

303.13 304.74 A: well right that was the thing 

305.57 311.98 A: and clinton and clinton didn't sit there like like bush is right now going i'm the ultimate liberator of the world 

305.67 307.30 B: (( that they're dealing with [laughter] )) 

310.12 312.04 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

312.25 325.09 A: bush is sitting there going look at me i have liberated the country no you you weren't you were flexing your power because you wanted to show something you know and it's in his family tradition to start wars you know if 

312.44 313.33 B: right 

314.46 315.78 B: oh god 

317.51 318.39 B: (( yeah )) 

319.74 320.77 B: (( yeah )) 

322.78 324.13 B: exactly 

324.26 332.17 B: but if there's a nation that is a threat to the united states i think maybe the nation is the president you know president bush like it's just 

331.24 335.40 A: exactly the republican party populates 

333.62 335.92 B: exactly [laughter] 

335.58 339.18 A: the one i don't trust them at all 

338.05 342.05 B: no no no it's really frightening to me how 

339.85 340.79 A: with any 

342.16 343.29 B: um 

344.05 350.32 B: you know how strong their agenda is and how little it's base in reality you know 

348.87 356.05 A: right and you know if you a- if you were to go to any other country and you were to ask people who do you think is a threat to your nation they would say the united states 

355.41 356.47 B: absolutely 

356.35 357.79 A: and especially now 

357.39 358.42 B: yep 

357.85 360.90 A: all of them would say the united states besides britain 

358.45 359.52 B: absolutely 

360.63 361.47 B: right 

361.19 364.55 A: you know they might say the same thing they were saying like north korea 

361.67 362.46 B: right 

363.13 365.33 B: right right right 

365.18 371.88 A: or iran you know maybe they'd say you know they're they're not people in that region i think 

365.39 366.15 B: right 

366.76 367.63 B: right 

367.74 368.65 B: yeah 

368.73 369.61 B: (( yeah )) 

372.70 381.97 A: um you know there may be certain cells like like the taliban and things like that who who i do fear you know but i i fear because they are so quiet 

378.99 379.87 B: right 

381.41 383.53 B: yeah mhm 

381.99 388.82 A: you know that that you know it's like the shady guys in the classroom you always got to worry about the real quiet one not the class clown 

385.90 387.90 B: [laughter] 

387.92 389.81 B: exactly right 

388.85 397.72 A: you know and that's that's exactly what they are so if you really have anything to fear i guess it would be just extremist cells of terrorism 

390.01 392.34 B: right right right right 

397.02 401.03 B: yeah and and i feel like um regardless of whether 

398.89 399.85 A: [cough] 

401.08 405.27 B: i mean sure you know it's better not to have nations that are funding 

405.28 406.21 A: mhm 

405.39 410.89 B: terrorists but even if there aren't any nations who are like openly or obviously 

411.13 413.41 B: harboring you know 

413.51 417.61 B: terrorist cells or whatever they are still gonna be there i mean they're still gonna 

417.14 419.36 A: yeah you are gonna find them everywhere 

418.58 433.44 B: they're gonna find their money they're gonna find their ways to do what they want to do and they are going to do what they want to do because of you know actions like the united states have just taken the past in the few months i mean that is exactly what this is and you know the thing that i think that is so explosive too about 

427.93 428.75 A: right 

433.87 436.94 B: about the kind of situation is also the whole um 

437.27 439.69 B: you know islamic versus western world 

439.11 449.48 A: yeah yeah and you you know i i hate to say that's partially our fault but it it's not our fault what it is it's a part of the government to not educate the masses on the islamic religion 

439.71 440.61 B: thing 

446.19 448.09 B: yeah yep 

448.86 449.79 B: yep

573.18 574.04 A: yeah 

577.20 588.22 B: you know everywhere every part of the country but i tend to think you know i tend to prejud- prejudicially think of you know the mid west or wherever there is so few minorities that people really don't have any experience with
