0.22 2.06 A: melissa alexander 

1.90 3.64 B: hi i'm robyn 

3.61 5.28 A: okay nice to meet you 

4.80 8.07 B: you too this is very interesting have you done this before 

7.54 9.72 A: no this is my first time 

9.28 10.26 B: me too 

9.89 17.16 A: my first time but ah the question was do do we think any other country is a threat to the u._s. 

16.67 17.56 B: right 

17.81 18.80 A: i do 

19.07 21.39 B: ah what country do you think 

20.78 25.94 A: i definitely think um syria is a threat to the u._s. 

25.97 36.93 A: and i'm kind of leaning towards russia because i i think syria is into the ah to the ah the chemical and the biological warfare 

36.55 37.57 B: mhm 

36.95 43.07 A: and i think russia has dealt a lot with um iraq 

43.09 51.27 A: and saddam and i think that they know a lot of saddam's secrets and i think that um i think 

52.45 55.31 A: also have some weapons of mass destruction too 

55.79 62.75 B: i think you are probably right um i never thought about russia being a a particular threat only 

62.04 63.00 A: mhm 

62.77 67.68 B: in that um again they seem to be opposing the ah 

67.86 70.68 B: lifting of sanctions you know to 

69.76 70.61 A: (( yeah )) 

70.82 72.57 B: from iraq but then 

72.97 81.28 B: they say that's all ah financially motivated so i'm not sure about that and um syria is always um 

75.92 76.80 A: (( yeah )) 

77.16 78.78 A: yeah 

80.65 81.60 A: (( ahah )) 

81.32 86.07 B: is is always a little bit scary a long with a couple of the african 

85.85 86.93 A: yes 

86.31 93.31 B: um countries which i think could possibly also um pose a threat at some time in the future 

90.05 91.03 A: yes 

92.94 94.27 A: i think so too 

93.58 102.34 B: ah i think that ah anyone that we find is harboring any of the fugitives um should be considered probably as a threat 

99.31 100.37 A: mhm 

102.03 102.91 A: yes 

102.65 104.44 B: and ah anyone 

104.46 106.34 B: um who 

106.53 108.39 B: well actually you know i 

108.46 114.43 B: i don't i don't really feel secure even with iraq at this point because of the 

113.79 115.08 A: no 

114.54 117.00 B: the shiite ah um 

117.34 130.13 B: demonstrations that are going on right now and the potential of iran and iraq to end up being ah more of a coalition than the u._s. and iraq is still out there you know 

119.44 120.32 A: yes 

128.18 132.48 A: exactly so iraq is still it's still a threat 

132.65 134.39 A: there's still a threat there 

134.31 136.50 B: right um do you 

136.58 137.81 B: um 

138.29 141.99 B: do you relate any country with um the ah 

142.16 143.72 B: al qaeda any more 

144.26 151.15 A: ah i think um i think i think that would be either afghanistan or iran 

150.77 152.05 B: mhm 

151.36 157.62 A: and the question still is that we have not been able to locate osama bin laden 

157.61 158.75 B: that's true 

158.19 162.45 A: you know and and that he's still very much a threat to the united states 

162.48 165.15 A: and i feel that um 

165.51 177.92 A: i feel that afghanistan and iran is still a threat to the united states and i know iran is still ah very much upset with the united states because back during the desert storm 

177.95 180.12 A: um um how 

180.56 184.32 A: the united states supposedly helped iraq 

184.50 185.51 B: right 

184.58 186.25 A: (( against iran )) 

185.93 186.80 B: right 

186.39 192.19 A: so i know i know iran still has has some you know some big problems with the 

192.23 200.85 A: united states and i'm thinking that probably one of the reasons that ah that attacks happened on nine nine eleven 

200.63 208.33 A: i think it just took that long for them to plan a terrorist attack against the united states and and execute it 

206.92 211.78 B: so you think it might have originated in iran as well as with al qae- al qaeda 

209.15 213.18 A: yes yes that's what i really feel 

211.71 218.66 B: i think you know you just brought up a pretty good point though also when you mentioned russia i never thought of it before but 

214.61 215.80 A: mhm 

218.21 219.45 A: mhm 

218.44 233.03 B: but of course ah there's afghanistan versus russia and and since we are now in in afghanistan and russia has always um had its problems with afghanistan then that makes it a little shaky in that area too 

221.94 223.18 A: exactly 

232.49 234.87 A: it very much does it 

233.79 236.53 B: yeah i never thought about it that way 

235.77 237.60 A: very much does 

236.92 239.83 B: but i somehow or another you know most of the time i 

239.78 253.33 B: i consider run- ah russia pretty benign only what i don't consider benign is um their um what they call their um their russian mafia and people who are 

251.23 252.13 A: okay 

253.28 259.76 B: trading in all kinds of ah black market um weapons and things since the 

258.18 259.53 A: exactly 

259.78 262.30 B: since the republic broke up 

261.99 273.69 A: exactly and i also ah i also had a little bit of concern with um with one of the a couple of the asian countries which i know still 

273.94 280.20 A: i mean even since the vietnam war they're still not really right with the united states 

280.00 281.44 B: oh absolutely 

280.80 289.03 A: and i feel i know i think it's japan that um have been banned from using um weapons in war 

289.20 292.85 B: absolutely um i lived in japan and for some time 

290.41 291.50 A: yeah 

292.18 293.86 A: did you okay 

293.26 295.42 B: and they're very very um 

295.55 298.59 B: opposed to anything nuclear whatsoever 

298.49 299.65 A: (( are they )) 

299.11 303.00 B: to the point that when they suspect that there is a 

303.13 306.65 B: a a ship coming into japan and even though we're 

306.27 307.14 A: (( ahah )) 

306.68 312.83 B: we're allies and we are there both to protect them and their their their military is really 

313.45 317.27 B: it's really a defensive force but um when- 

315.73 316.77 A: mhm 

317.40 319.09 B: (( whenever there's a )) 

319.28 331.22 B: suspected nuclear anything in port or coming into port there's huge demonstrations against the american bases yeah um which is it's you know it's 

321.64 322.65 A: mhm 

325.35 326.53 A: is there 

327.92 329.41 A: wow 

331.56 337.58 B: the the wounds of world war two have not gone away by any means 

334.63 335.56 A: okay 

336.10 337.88 A: no they haven't 

337.67 341.41 B: and the ah the fears are there but i think you know we're 

341.66 352.18 B: um i mean if china wasn't so busy dealing with sars right now we would be wanting to keep an eye oh that brings up that brings up north korea do 

347.07 347.93 A: yeah 

349.62 350.60 A: yes 

351.49 352.99 A: yes it does 

352.52 354.60 B: you think they are a threat 

354.64 356.58 A: yes i do 

356.43 357.50 B: mhm 

357.22 361.67 A: yes i do i think there's a chance that north korea is a threat 

361.73 362.69 A: um 

362.77 363.98 A: i heard 

364.10 370.47 A: i heard during one of the c._n._n. broadcasts then um ah since the war has been going on 

370.56 372.35 A: that the um 

372.98 379.88 A: i don't know what they i know it is not the president it might be the prime minister whatever over there really opposed to this war 

379.98 388.18 A: and the the protesting i heard really just got pretty much outrageous over there of course you know the protesting everywhere has been 

380.02 380.80 B: right 

388.20 389.02 B: true 

388.43 392.44 A: pretty bad but i i think north korea may be a threat 

392.58 398.47 A: i do you know my me and my husband were talking about this and my husband was telling me their 

398.65 401.48 A: most all the countries really 

401.50 403.48 A: don't like the united states 

403.83 409.39 B: right right they consider us imperialist and and um 

404.75 405.85 A: (( i mean )) 

407.94 408.99 A: okay 

409.55 412.22 B: a threat to their way of life 

411.62 415.28 A: and they feel that we're we're kind of bold in our actions 

414.67 423.06 B: exactly that we are much too aggressive and and we are trying to push our ideals on them and ah it's it's 

416.73 418.47 A: yeah that's true 

420.06 421.09 A: yeah 

423.17 427.04 B: that we are arrogant and and that yeah 

424.45 426.24 A: yes that's what they think 

426.32 434.81 A: that's what they think and a lot of them really don't like us for those reasons you know but i really feel that the intent 

435.41 442.95 A: was right and i think we did the right thing as far as somebody had to step in and try to get 

443.03 446.24 A: under control saddam and his regime 

446.23 449.90 B: well in twenty twenty hindsight i'd i'd go along with 

449.85 461.39 A: yeah i agree for the reasons because i believe over there um with his dictatorship and how i mean they just kill people just you know 

450.50 451.55 B: that 

461.54 465.43 A: for whatever reason the torture chambers the the rape room 

465.47 479.57 B: i think that goes on in a lot of countries and the reason we chose there is because we were hoping to end up with an alliance between um with iraq and i i have some doubts whether that is going to be what comes out of it 

465.50 466.37 A: (( i )) 

467.64 469.02 A: think it does too 

472.40 473.15 A: with 

479.15 480.95 A: i don't think it is either 

480.32 483.19 B: um i think we may ah 

483.39 493.72 B: we may end up with an alliance similar to saudi arabia where they they do their own thing but ah we have some oil interests that you know in the end 

486.60 487.48 A: okay 

493.06 503.15 A: exactly you see that brings up another topic of the conversation is um a a lot of people believe that united states or bush is in it for the oil 

493.88 495.02 B: and that 

503.77 505.39 A: (( you know the oil )) 

505.09 507.06 B: well you know i don't trust him 

506.85 508.19 A: no neither do i 

507.30 508.45 B: personally 

508.55 509.87 A: (( neither do i )) 

509.13 514.94 B: and ah i don't trust him in the least or any of his his ah 

510.04 511.62 A: [laughter] 

512.92 514.41 A: (( neither do i )) 

515.38 525.36 B: ah people surrounding him i really don't i really think that that he comes from the old school where the people are ignorant and the that the um 

517.29 518.34 A: no 

525.68 529.34 B: the business interests are really what what 

529.41 534.99 B: means more than the individual and and i don't trust him at all 

532.46 533.35 A: exactly 

534.45 535.65 A: i don't either 

535.07 542.61 B: um but on the other hand um and and my big fear of course which was not 

540.63 541.52 A: mhm 

542.69 553.05 B: did not come to pass was that as soon as we got involved in iraq that ah that israel would end up getting involved and i'm glad that didn't happen 

544.06 545.03 A: mhm 

552.37 553.62 A: me too 

553.25 560.03 B: we would have had a very big mess i was really impressed um at the fact that they 

556.44 557.23 A: yeah 

557.91 558.90 A: yeah 

560.12 564.38 B: they knocked out anything within range of israel right away 

563.78 565.37 A: yeah me too 

564.86 570.12 B: or it would have been a horrible disaster with so many of the countries then getting involved 

569.47 579.97 A: involved yeah and you know what i mean we can't fight and beat everybody you know we can't fight 'em all so i'm glad i'm glad that israel 

575.14 576.44 B: right 

578.67 590.86 B: this may well back fire i think you know i mean if this turns into another um ah shiite arab state it's gonna be a big it's gonna be a big um let down for um 

586.35 587.66 A: yeah 

590.86 599.95 B: a l- a lot of the people a lot of the world and we are now committed to rebuilding so are we going to go in there and rebuild our enemies 

592.30 593.44 A: yes it is 

597.49 598.68 A: yep
