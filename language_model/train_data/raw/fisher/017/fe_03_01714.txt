150.26 151.83 A: (( [mn] mhm [mn] )) 

151.73 156.66 B: i guess tha- that would happen if we went to any of the other ah countries 

156.04 164.04 A: yeah i had a a friend i went to college with who um [lipsmack] she's ah um [lipsmack] a little person you know like she's a midget

198.77 200.01 B: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

200.14 213.66 A: but that was just scary you know thinking about people that are handicapped [noise] or couldn't you know even couldn't even get out of the building even if you know they were on a safe floor but it was just really wild and she tells the story about 

213.65 221.04 A: you know her friends and and ah people that she worked with ah just you know being in the building when it happened but [mn] 

220.46 230.37 B: [noise] [mn] and that's that's al- always the other thing too there were so many more that could have been hurt that weren't and you always wonder why you know and and what their reasoning is 

224.49 229.32 A: right yeah i mean it was really fortunate yeah they said that 

230.55 236.30 A: [mn] yeah i mean i just think we were just blessed you know that it wasn't worse than it it you know than it was 

238.53 239.85 A: (( [noise] but [lipsmack] so [noise] )) 

238.54 239.37 B: (( mhm )) 

239.54 243.40 B: (( [mn] you know for those other countries like coming in attacking us ))

248.55 249.82 A: (( yeah i know i'm )) 

249.16 252.18 B: but maybe i'm just i'm the perpetual optimist though yeah 

251.55 256.41 A: yeah well i'm a yeah i i mean i just you know worry about all these different 

256.75 257.71 A: um 

257.83 261.03 A: terror groups you know and that 

260.46 261.94 B: because they're not sane 

261.46 263.69 A: yeah exactly [mn] [mn] 

262.88 265.39 B: you know and it's just like with the people who are 

265.45 269.69 B: [mn] murderers who you know if th- who get off and when they're 

271.29 275.51 B: considered mentally incompetent that that for me is somehow is is wrong too 

272.66 273.74 A: mhm 

275.33 276.26 A: yeah 

275.77 286.78 B: because you know they were trying to kill somebody you know why should you get less of a of a of a punishment for trying to kill someone than for actually killing someone and just cause you botched the job or something [laughter] 

283.93 284.95 A: mhm 

285.59 288.83 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

287.17 289.59 B: [laughter] does it mean you should get off lightly 

289.23 290.10 A: [laughter] 

291.37 292.31 B: but 

292.51 301.89 A: so yeah i know i don't think i i don't think any any country would like would attack us they know darn gone well we'd we'd [laughter] we'd obliterate them 

301.27 303.15 B: and we do have enough whe- for 

301.95 307.38 A: but i- if if they but i don't think i think there are some of these countries that wouldn't think twice about 

307.65 319.02 A: knowing if they got you know like a germ warfare or some kind of nuclear device that you know would do a dirty bomb that that if they could get it to a terrorist group without being 

318.97 324.41 A: you know traced to them that they would do it i think they would i mean if they could but 

320.31 321.21 B: mhm 

324.11 326.67 B: individuals right from the coun- from the
