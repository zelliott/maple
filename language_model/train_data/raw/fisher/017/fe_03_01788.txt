2.77 3.79 B: yes 

4.61 5.32 B: hi 

5.77 8.81 B: (( oh hi karen this is gina from ohio )) 

8.63 13.16 A: gina in ohio so we're talking about education and computers 

9.62 10.46 B: yes 

12.84 15.45 B: yes we are whether it harms you or helps 

15.43 17.64 A: or helps um well this is my first 

15.59 16.22 B: (( you [noise] )) 

16.29 21.86 B: i just got my son off the bus [laughter] i just got my son off the bus so if it sounds loud 

18.27 20.24 A: (( you what kids getting of the bus )) 

20.66 21.73 A: oh okay 

21.92 26.00 A: um [mn] this is my first call too so that i'm new at this but um 

24.84 26.02 B: oh okay 

26.09 26.92 A: um 

27.35 34.17 A: i think it helps if it's used in moderation ah i'm not sure how computers are used in ohio but um 

34.09 43.08 A: we start our kids off using the computers in kindergarten um and they use them a little bit throughout the day right on through 

43.10 45.68 A: um i don't know how about in ohio do they 

45.46 50.34 B: um yes we do have computers in our school system and they actually 

48.62 49.39 A: (( ahah )) 

50.40 53.90 B: i don't think they they did touch on it a little bit in kindergarten 

53.26 54.54 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

54.13 56.65 B: but they use it more in first grade 

56.29 57.21 A: right 

56.88 66.07 B: like it's a daily activity but like my husband got mad at me because [laughter] i recently did get a new computer [noise] and um i'm on the phone 

63.63 64.47 A: (( ahah )) 

66.53 73.88 B: and um [sigh] he wanted me um to have my son for me to get him on the computer and train him for one hour a day 

73.65 74.83 A: oh my goodness 

74.31 83.67 B: and i said no [laughter] um when he gets to the point where he needs to do book reports or whatever or if he's interested in a subject 

84.09 91.13 B: you know i will go on the c- i'm not on the computer a lot and i said then we can go in and look it up 

87.14 88.19 A: right 

90.52 91.61 A: right 

91.48 98.20 B: i said but i think computers do help the kids in school because any more technology 

91.64 92.33 A: so 

98.25 99.91 B: is towards ah 

101.06 104.36 B: um computers and 

104.50 108.59 B: i know that i was i just now recently got a new computer 

108.97 110.26 B: and it's ah 

110.91 111.89 B: (( [cough] )) 

112.03 118.72 B: it has educated me a lot but being computer illiterate i don't think you cannot be com- computer illiterate anymore 

113.85 114.91 A: right 

118.34 120.49 A: no i agree i mean i think in 

120.43 126.70 A: in this day and age i- i- if you don't have computer skills you're not marketable at all as far as finding a job 

121.80 122.78 B: (( [noise] )) 

126.40 128.00 B: (( exactly [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

126.60 130.58 A: um but then on the other hand [mn] you know that hands on 

130.48 144.03 A: sitting down with a magazine reading you know i know people that read the magazine i mean read newspapers on line you know i prefer to have my newspaper in front of me to read and um i think that's good for children to have that hands on 

143.97 154.54 A: with books and learning things and going to the library and actually looking at books but then on the other hand you know especially in rural areas that don't have large libraries but they've got internet access 

154.52 169.47 A: you know kids that as long as they can use a computer they've got this world of information that they can go to um i mean you've got to get that that centre line where you're not relying too much on the computers but you're relying enough on them so that the kids know how to use them 

169.14 170.70 B: exactly 

169.54 175.04 A: you know and work with them and i think in kindergarten and in first grade our schools 

174.97 177.38 A: most of what they do on the computer 

177.31 191.74 A: is the accelerated reader um they do like little book reports you have to read these litty bitty nonsense books and then you have to answer questions you know about the the subject of the book and they learned how to point and click you know which basically that's learning them how to 

183.42 184.25 B: (( ahah )) 

187.54 188.43 B: (( exact- )) 

191.85 204.65 A: point and click and find their name and find answers um get them used to the computer and then you know they use it more obviously as they keep getting older they i've got a fifth grader and they use it quite a bit in their classroom 

197.35 198.27 B: right 

205.09 208.86 B: right i think it's fine for the classroom but at home 

205.35 206.25 A: but 

209.16 214.07 B: um i don't really think the kids should be on the computer unless it is for homework 

213.71 214.62 A: right 

214.41 225.12 B: like i don't think i mean now i have a lot of niece and nephews that do use it for to write back and forth to their friends but i think there should be a time limit you know 

222.69 223.66 A: right 

224.39 227.32 A: yeah and i think that's with every technology 

225.07 230.15 B: because you could really get i know if i get on there i f- my ti- the time flies 

230.20 233.64 A: yes in an hour you're like whoa it's an hour gone already 

233.79 234.70 B: right 

235.55 249.36 A: and you know there's so many other bad things in computers that kids can get hold of you know it's got to be monitored um you know but in in in school settings now i think you know because there's more monitored then but you know and it's 

236.14 236.73 B: (( [mn] )) 

241.15 242.57 B: exactly 

249.66 251.54 A: i think it should be more of a 

251.71 252.84 A: i think they should 

253.68 256.78 A: teach the children how to learn to use the computers 

256.84 258.54 A: in addition to 

258.56 267.75 A: just trying to look up information you know learn the ins and outs of a computer you know how it right how to do programming things you know 

263.25 264.46 B: right like how 

264.93 266.04 B: (( does )) 

266.48 267.90 B: exactly 

267.81 270.54 A: that and how to to work and and like 

271.08 283.26 A: how to do reports and stuff in the computer not just as a research tool um you know that's great you know we had typewriters i'm i'm thirty seven years old and you know we had typewriters that had to do everything and now they've got word processing 

283.23 297.71 A: on every computer and it's um it's good for the kids to know how to to do to use that because when you can say that you can use excel or word or powerpoint or something you know again it makes you more marketable when you get out of school which i think is good 

296.32 300.46 B: right ah that came with my computer and i'm [laughter] i i 

299.72 300.79 A: you're learning 

300.55 307.55 B: i typed on it but i don't know like everyone says yeah do you know how to do wordperfect or whatever i'm like well i've used it i don't know if i'm doing it right 

304.84 305.80 A: right 

307.65 308.67 A: right 

307.67 310.65 B: [laughter] you know what i mean [laughter] 

309.96 321.68 A: yeah like the community colleges and they you know they offer these classes on it you know which i've never been to one i just had to pick and and fiddle with it until i figured it out but i'm sure i could probably be more efficient with it if i actually took a class 

316.97 318.64 B: right 

321.51 335.16 A: you know because i think i hope that's something that they'll especially in high school they'll offer the kids and and they may a lot of educational you know systems may do that um you know educate them into you know how you can do a book report in here and how you can you know 

321.61 323.18 B: yeah [mn] 

335.21 338.07 A: just like you had typing classes you had keyboarding classes 

337.92 338.79 B: right 

338.22 351.70 A: i i think that's a a good tool but you know i i've seen some areas where they seem like they rely too heavily on the computer you know and kids still need that hands on type stuff you know i think 

348.72 349.80 B: (( [mn] )) 

350.20 352.82 B: they need the dictionary and 

351.98 352.92 A: (( mhm you )) 

353.71 357.13 B: and like you said they need the library system and stuff too 

353.91 355.04 A: know because it's 

356.41 363.51 A: right and you know looking up a word in the dictionary you know got they've got these on line dictionaries that you just type it in and it's like 

363.66 367.08 A: you know that instead of thumbing through a dictionary yeah 

363.98 366.00 B: [noise] in the correction part 

367.48 376.90 A: and ah word correction and everything else but our our school systems i think here have done a pretty good job of integrating computers and um 

376.74 385.39 A: the our p._t._o.s are try- or are buying little bit newer computers for them to use which is you know helpful but i've been we've been fortunate here it doesn't seem like it's 

385.69 388.27 A: they're taking you know a tremendous 

389.56 394.67 A: view of all right we're going to do computers computers computers you know so we've been kind of leveled 

394.72 396.80 A: than maybe other school systems 

394.78 399.07 B: [noise] right are there our main focus here is more reading 

398.98 399.83 A: really 

399.61 403.79 B: reading and math and i do see the computer on 

403.80 405.71 B: but it's not on um 

406.68 410.15 B: they go as groups but my son's only in first grade 

408.19 409.23 A: mhm 

409.85 410.79 A: right 

410.38 414.64 B: and um i have one in preschool so [noise] it's not 

415.22 417.45 B: where i'm you know i'm right on it 

417.23 418.19 A: right 

418.00 421.19 B: i sometimes i get to go in and volunteer [laughter] 

420.41 422.73 A: ahah [laughter] which is always good 

422.25 423.45 B: yeah 

422.86 425.60 A: yeah as a matter of fact i think in the earlier grades 

425.43 439.26 A: the computers are actually in the the library which they call the resource centre now um and the computers are there and they go in as a group and they have like five at a time you know using and i think that's good that keeps it from being 

439.10 449.02 A: you know if every kid had a computer um at their desk then it would be used much heavily and we actually started in north carolina ah a new school 

449.35 453.94 A: it's still part of our school system but it's ah i can't think of the name of it but um 

449.73 450.33 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

454.36 457.27 A: part of this is an alternative type school but 

457.37 462.33 A: if you when you sign up for this school y- every child is given a brand new computer 

462.00 464.55 B: [noise] oh that's wonderful 

462.35 464.11 A: and part of their 

464.26 472.65 A: yeah and part of their assignments are that they have they interact with other kids the edison edison school that they um 

472.66 478.40 A: are in contact with other edison students um across the country and 

477.09 479.73 B: like instant messaging and stuff 

478.69 490.66 A: right kinda and and they share information and they work together on projects and that i haven't actually seen how it w- i mean the school obviously is working good they've got a waiting list to go in it but i think they re- 

490.48 493.75 A: rely heavily on the computer usage 

493.75 507.20 A: and um obviously if they're giving every student a a a computer as part of the agreement to go to that school and um and in some areas there's a long waiting list to actually get transferred over into that because it's still a public school but it's um 

500.16 501.09 B: right 

507.14 514.63 A: you know it's a whole different system and um you know that's kinda a little bit scary because you wonder just how much you know what's it mean is it 

515.06 520.62 A: too much of the teaching doing by computer and not hands on with the teacher yeah 

518.44 520.37 B: and not one on one yeah 

520.67 523.90 B: but then you get the classrooms that are way too big 

523.54 524.46 A: right 

524.20 526.82 B: and the teacher really can't get to all of them 

526.67 529.62 A: that's right so you can go and get some extra 

527.96 534.79 B: so it's kinda like [laughter] it it's got its positives and negatives but then it relies more on the parents 

530.96 532.60 A: yeah and see w- 

535.67 537.17 A: right to do the 

535.88 539.38 B: you know on the teaching part but like my son comes home now 

540.05 541.69 B: and he has tonnes of homework 

541.59 542.77 A: mhm 

542.76 545.25 B: and he's only in first grade so i mean 

544.15 545.24 A: yeah 

545.42 546.70 B: i don't know 

547.62 560.38 A: and then it's and computers i think are becoming you know i don't i hadn't read any percentages of [mn] what percentage of house- households have computers now but for those households that don't have a computer 

560.28 573.96 A: you know it puts the child at a disadvantage when every other child in the the class has a computer and has much more knowledge readily available you know every night rather than having to make a trip to the library or somewhere um 

562.70 563.71 B: (( exactly )) 

573.31 581.42 B: right that's why i ended up getting a newer computer this year because i know my son's going into second grade and he might have to start doing reports and stuff 

578.54 579.60 A: right 

581.55 583.76 B: because he does book reports now 

581.65 582.31 A: (( [noise] )) 

584.08 585.15 A: gracious 

585.07 587.29 B: so he has to read and do a book report 

587.47 590.08 B: i mean it's like three sentences but you know 

589.20 591.15 A: [noise] ahah right they still have to 

590.98 594.16 B: so [laughter] [laughter] that's a lot for first grade 

592.29 593.13 A: to do it 

593.71 598.48 A: wow in first grade a whole lot different than when i was in first grade gracious 

598.29 599.89 B: yeah i'm thirty six
