0.63 2.47 A: rachel hello 

0.67 1.72 B: (( simone )) 

2.35 4.09 B: hi i'm simone 

3.87 5.20 A: hi i'm rachel 

5.02 6.10 B: hi 

6.63 12.46 A: um so do you what countries do you think are a threat to the the u._s. 

12.70 18.08 B: i actually don't think that any countries are a threat to the u._s. um 

19.13 23.22 B: (( [lipsmack] i [noise] do you think that there are countries that are a threat to the u._s. )) 

24.15 26.09 A: wait i didn't hear you what did you say 

25.33 27.40 B: i i was can you hear me now 

27.11 27.97 A: yes 

27.97 31.86 B: i don't think that any countries are a threat to the u._s. um 

33.32 33.88 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

34.13 37.01 B: do do you think that there are countries that are a threat 

37.19 40.62 A: i think right now given the war um 

40.94 46.73 A: in those couple of years well once they you know get back to normal iraq will probably be a 

46.93 50.91 A: big threat [laughter] to us considering what we just did to them 

51.25 58.67 B: so you think that they're a threat because of what we did what the war that we [noise] um 

59.03 63.94 B: went there but why do you think that they would be a threat i mean what 

64.28 66.54 A: well right now i think they 

66.55 70.41 A: will be in in a little while once they get better maybe 

70.50 82.13 A: if um saddam is found and or if he comes about and builds an army again i i don't know if he died i haven't been watching t._v. but um d- did they find out whether he died or not 

81.90 91.03 B: i actually don't watch t._v. at all either um [lipsmack] i listen to the radio but from what i've heard they haven't um 

91.48 97.11 B: so you think that if he were in power or if he um 

97.88 101.61 B: [lipsmack] came back that there could be a threat either 

101.66 102.69 B: (( from )) 

103.06 108.46 B: um iraq as a nation or some individual people within iraq 

108.77 117.61 A: it's probably individual actually probably not the country then more so like he's a threat and people that follow him are a threat but not the country as a whole 

111.65 112.92 B: okay som- 

117.88 118.66 B: mm 

118.46 120.70 A: i guess would be more of the answer [laughter] 

118.95 119.81 B: um 

121.00 130.86 B: so i i probably would kind ah sort of agree with you just because i don't think when i say i don't think any countries are a threat it's basically because um [lipsmack] 

132.70 139.39 B: i well i mean i i do think that if we threaten other nations um 

139.75 144.00 B: you know with our power not necessarily just with war but with our policies that there's 

144.16 153.31 B: a danger um that countries begin to see us as the cause of a lot of their problems 

153.40 154.76 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

153.79 157.70 B: and so um in that sense there's 

158.21 172.73 B: a potential for that but i don't i don't necessarily feel a threat in the same way that i hear a lot of people talking about september eleventh and how you know they can attack us at any moment i actually heard somebody speaking today about how 

172.90 183.70 B: um american lives are um threatened you never know at any moment um with international terrorism every single one of us is a target 

183.84 184.84 B: um 

185.53 193.18 B: but i think that i don't think that it's necessarily any worse now than it has been in the past it might have been 

193.91 202.12 B: other groups that wouldn't necessarily have targeted americans but you could have while travelling in certain countries you could have um 

203.15 207.09 B: been like a casualty of of a target of somebody else 

207.88 208.86 A: (( mhm )) 

208.24 221.64 B: but do you know what i'm saying like [mn] it's somebody else in other countries targeted or um not just an individual but say [mn] the example that i always think of is like the i._r._a. if if they plant bombs in britain 

221.97 229.44 B: you as a traveller could potentially be hit by that and so i don't think that um 

231.03 235.27 B: [lipsmack] that that necessarily makes us any more of a threat today just because 

236.16 240.68 B: for the most part no americans are travelling to the parts of the world where 

241.18 248.03 B: iraqis live or where afghans live or do you know what i'm saying so i don't think that we're any more threatened right now 

248.16 251.93 B: than we have been and i don't think that 

250.91 254.54 A: are you talking about we as individuals or we as a country 

253.44 261.99 B: yeah yeah we as individuals and as a country just because i don't think that any of the other countries have any of the weapons that 

262.20 265.20 B: could possibly even reach the united states 

266.14 267.66 A: oh that's true 

268.19 271.92 A: that's true but they have creative ways of coming in and 

268.61 269.75 B: so 

271.30 271.86 B: (( [mn] )) 

272.11 275.43 A: doing stuff to us like ah september eleventh [laughter] 

272.44 273.32 B: that 

274.98 279.26 B: that's true but i don't i mean i think that those 

280.37 286.14 B: [mn] i don't know how to put it into words but i basically don't think that um 

288.54 290.87 B: that [mn] a person can 

291.41 297.92 B: think about those kinds of things like i mean in a sense september eleventh is completely a fluke 

297.96 300.80 B: that it went off the way that it did 

300.54 301.62 A: mhm 

301.03 303.55 B: um [lipsmack] and so 

303.75 306.35 B: while there are creative ways of 

306.93 320.28 B: getting around not having the same capabilities militarily that the united states have i don't think that i still just don't think the united states is heavily threatened when i hear bush or other people talking about 

320.56 322.81 B: oh the u._s. is you know 

322.83 332.25 B: there's this threat we have to give up our civil liberties i just i don't see that i don't see us as being in imminent threat or imminently threatened 

332.32 336.58 B: um by other nations at all or even people from those other nations 

337.87 340.02 A: mm i do see individuals 

340.25 344.34 A: especially travelling in other parts of the world not necessarily iraq but um 

344.67 350.98 A: just in other parts americans which particularly i see them as possibly being threatened just as 

351.06 353.26 A: by anti american 

353.43 363.11 A: people pretty much not countries but people because i know um i mean i i did some studying abroad last year and you know there are people out there that hate americans 

362.89 365.29 B: mhm where did you study abroad 

363.53 364.27 A: so 

364.95 365.84 A: london 

365.89 366.79 B: (( okay )) 

366.39 374.47 A: and surprisingly right you know our [laughter] our country that you know supposed to be our friend there are people over there that absolutely hate us so 

375.42 377.25 A: i definitely think that 

376.70 378.83 B: (( what do you think that they hate )) 

379.39 390.10 B: when you say us what do you mean like americans or that they dislike our government or that they dislike the attitude of americans or 

382.22 383.10 A: ameri- 

389.03 390.70 A: attitudes of americans 

391.09 396.42 B: which is not to say like that they hate us but that they hate our attitude 

396.33 399.18 A: well i think they found that um 

400.36 404.04 A: that i guess they have stereotypes of what americans are and 

403.42 404.49 B: mhm 

404.51 408.19 A: [noise] that's what they're basing it all off of they don't understand that we're different 

406.64 415.50 B: but it seems like we create those stereotypes ourselves in a sense i mean and we're making people hate us hate us with those 

415.56 424.15 B: um stereotypes either basically through the media but i think like the kinds of policies that our government um 

424.53 429.34 B: makes also kind of stereotypes us in a sense by 

430.36 444.21 B: making it like we're very individualistic we're going to make our own choices which is not necessarily like how individually americans think but in a sense like i feel like the government is stereotyping us by doing that 

445.01 445.82 A: (( mm )) 

447.00 448.18 A: i see that 

448.60 450.65 A: i can definitely see that um 

452.42 454.36 A: i don't know everything 

455.23 459.22 A: sorry i'm thinking back to i guess in the beginning everything used to be 

459.30 461.93 A: decent when ah washington 

462.00 467.57 A: used to lead the c- i think it's washington that said you know we lead by a policy of isolation we don't mess with it 

467.71 470.34 A: if it doesn't pertain to us but now everything 

470.79 472.55 A: does [laughter] 

472.58 473.99 B: mhm 

472.84 479.70 A: pertain to us so i guess that whole theory of isolation and the way we were led back then has completely died down [laughter] 

479.81 481.54 A: one hundred percent [laughter] 

481.93 482.76 B: (( mm )) 

483.80 484.72 B: so 

485.05 491.34 B: when you were travelling abroad did you meet non british people who 

491.54 492.69 B: um 

492.98 497.77 B: either disliked america or who you thought were a threat to the united states 

498.03 502.79 A: um i did meet one he was in my study group he was actually in england he was um 

503.15 507.22 A: he was very happy when september eleventh happened and i actually got in an argument over 

507.27 508.50 A: (( september eleventh )) 

507.51 509.89 B: but he wasn't he wasn't british 

509.22 514.68 A: no he was i don't know what he was actually i mean i never asked he he definitely was not 

515.01 519.17 A: english born or english raised or whatever you want to say he um 

520.73 522.80 A: [lipsmack] he was very happy about it [laughter] 

523.00 525.85 A: very happy about september eleventh so 

523.54 524.10 B: (( [mn] )) 

525.28 527.29 B: what like what did he say 

527.75 536.37 A: oh gosh i can't even remember the details i just remember he said you know americans go in and they do this to other countries all the time i'm happy to see it's happened 

536.39 537.47 B: mhm 

536.53 538.82 A: to them for once 

539.02 549.17 A: i was laughing when it happened i thought it was funny um a lot of there were also some other british kids in the room with me though and they were just they were appalled that he was saying it because i kept saying you know what 

549.33 550.49 A: it's ah 

550.19 551.42 B: [noise] 

551.06 554.49 A: innocent people that have died it's [laughter] 

554.56 555.56 A: (( you know it's )) 

554.95 556.36 B: mhm 

555.78 567.65 A: not necessarily people that are making the policies just normal people like you and me that have died and that's the sad thing and you were laughing about this what's wrong with you you know so possibly somebody like him might be [laughter] a threat [laughter] 

567.56 568.63 B: right 

567.77 570.63 A: to america someone with that mind set of um 

571.31 573.93 A: of you know you've done it to others now 

574.10 575.89 A: it's good that it's done to you 

575.82 578.76 B: but do you think that british people are a threat 

578.91 582.78 A: i wouldn't say it's british people because he definitely is not british 

582.54 589.59 B: but before you were saying that there were british people who hate america so do you think that that hatred carries over to being a threat 

590.38 591.31 A: um 

592.49 593.59 A: no 

593.84 598.46 A: they just hate us i i don't feel threatened by them or i i didn't feel threatened by them 

598.73 599.95 A: so
