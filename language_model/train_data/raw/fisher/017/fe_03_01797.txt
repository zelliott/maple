40.14 41.84 A: (( it could be both it )) 

41.95 45.51 A: could be beneficial it could not be because they don't

110.69 111.41 B: (( hm mm )) 

111.66 114.35 A: in that aspect it's kinda good then for them 

114.61 117.55 A: that they don't use it for education purposes 

118.05 120.29 A: that they're strictly book related 

121.92 122.88 A: (( so they ))

155.47 156.41 B: um 

155.62 161.23 A: i i could definitely see my daughter using the internet to do her homework since she's so 

162.24 164.29 A: so loves the computer right now 

164.10 165.25 B: mhm 

165.59 168.81 A: and she loves playing like at nic junior 

169.47 171.98 A: playing all the games and that 

170.93 179.63 B: uh-huh yeah my eight year old loves it too um she if she sees and address on t._v. you know

190.61 191.84 A: (( but then )) 

191.93 195.84 A: okay in that aspect then that's educational too then 'cause she's 

196.26 199.49 A: she's learning to put you know two and two together 

199.99 206.16 A: that web address on t._v. that she can type that in on the computer and you know get what she 

206.35 207.76 A: get to barbie 

207.90 211.95 A: so in that aspect it's educational 'cause she's learning that 

210.85 214.61 B: she's mhm yeah i was just amazed at how young she could do that 

214.14 215.30 A: (( yeah )) 

214.72 217.74 B: or take the box of macaroni and cheese and 

217.94 223.79 B: haul it in by the computer in as the cheesiest dot com or something like that and she would type it in 

222.19 223.54 A: oh wow 

223.80 225.43 A: oh wow [laughter] 

224.25 226.87 B: [laughter] 

226.24 229.42 A: that's pretty cool oh i have so much to look forward to 

228.80 231.72 B: (( [laughter] mhm )) 

231.02 235.40 A: i can see mine doing that i used to have ah oh god what was it called 

232.59 233.39 B: (( mhm )) 

236.03 239.28 A: q-bert or something it was some little 

240.23 242.56 A: it looked exactly like a mouse 

242.71 243.90 A: and you 

244.41 250.40 A: you ran the infrared light over any u._p._c. symbol and it automatically brought up the web site 

250.77 263.57 A: and i was addicted to that for a while taking everything that had a u._p._c. symbol and swiping it across there and bring up see if they had web sites and that so i can see my daughter any time she sees a web site on t._v. going 

263.52 266.79 A: (( momma momma i want to type that in and check that out )) 

266.94 270.69 A: so that's that from that aspect i guess that's educational 

271.72 275.29 B: as far as in schools you know it really 

276.85 278.78 B: for teachers it it 

279.38 283.14 A: i think it's a easy way out for teachers 

284.09 285.34 A: to have them 

284.09 285.21 B: maybe 

285.68 289.71 B: but they have access to such so much more than you would ever have 

289.08 291.03 A: well that yeah that's true 

291.23 292.19 B: (( you know )) 

293.34 296.82 A: i don't think they'd ever get it in a book one book 

297.54 298.87 A: yeah that's true 

299.05 302.01 B: mhm um educational things 

303.36 305.84 B: i'm sure there's a lot of educational things 

306.39 308.87 B: that they can use in their classroom 

310.27 312.03 B: available on the internet um 

317.08 324.75 B: but then i always wonder if there's one kid over in the corner who's watching who's clicking on pornography type 

324.76 326.06 B: [laughter] 

325.55 330.38 A: yeah i wonder how that would i wonder if they have blockers so they can't do stuff like 

329.34 332.27 B: i would imagine in schools they probably do 

332.37 334.41 A: that i'd hope so 

334.54 336.60 B: i would hope so yeah yeah 

337.08 341.30 A: i know i don't have anything blocked on mine right now but then my daughter doesn't know how to 

342.54 344.20 A: type words or 

345.16 347.82 A: she only goes on if like i let her on 

348.22 349.75 A: and bring her to the site 

349.00 351.56 B: [laughter] oh i mean you can type in something 

352.11 353.24 B: there was a 

353.59 356.47 B: a grandma in our neighbourhood who 

356.99 363.11 B: wanted some recipes and she typed in hot dish [laughter] 

361.49 363.26 A: and it brought up something 

363.26 367.08 B: oh yeah hot dishes you know that's kind of a midwestern thing 

367.09 368.32 A: (( nice )) 

368.65 370.22 B: i don't know where you're from 

370.31 371.46 A: wisconsin 

371.37 373.17 B: oh yeah see i'm in minnesota 

373.18 381.81 B: you know here we call it hot dish but other in the rest of the world it's called casserole [laughter] but when she typed in hot dish she got 

378.11 379.85 A: okay 

381.70 388.81 B: a lot more than recipes [laughter] it was pretty funny [laughter] 

383.05 384.75 A: okay 

388.75 390.07 A: (( [laughter] wow i'll )) 

389.68 390.62 B: (( i )) 

390.64 392.24 A: have to remember that one 

391.15 394.24 B: would think the schools would have to have filters on them 

394.69 398.56 A: yeah but then something like that who would ever think 

398.80 402.65 A: i would of never in a million years imagined hot dish would brought 

403.67 404.82 A: something 

405.40 407.33 A: unrelated to food up 

406.99 408.64 B: [laughter] 

408.30 412.01 A: so how how do they have blockers in school and 

411.41 413.91 B: yeah i don't know how well those work 

412.93 414.05 A: wow 

414.96 418.23 A: okay now i'm not a fan of computers in school [laughter] 

415.30 416.22 B: (( you know )) 

418.14 419.20 B: [laughter] 

420.03 421.21 A: hm 

423.69 424.70 A: but 

425.12 429.50 A: no that's i don't know just i never thought about it either i guess 

428.68 434.50 B: but you know what it's just so accessible on the internet you know when you bring up like your yahoo home page 

434.89 436.23 B: or something 

436.27 436.93 B: i 

437.32 443.47 B: not that i've studied it but i think every search engine has you know adult entertainment or 

444.34 445.28 B: you know 

445.51 446.90 B: something on their 

447.79 448.97 B: home page 

449.40 451.77 B: you know it's just as easy as can be 

453.77 458.56 A: (( hm you know what i'll have to check that out i don't even i have a._o._l. )) 

457.29 458.79 B: (( oh i think so )) 

459.23 460.50 B: in fact um 

460.78 464.44 B: there's my oldest son i can he doesn't live at home but 

464.74 467.46 B: for a while there i could tell 

468.71 469.62 B: that 

469.66 477.98 B: he was using the computer [laughter] not in the way that i would intend it we had to have a little chat [laughter] and um 

473.71 474.86 A: ah 

478.85 484.62 B: after he visited those and now this is something i get i get emails 

484.87 486.83 B: with pornographic stuff in 

486.40 488.90 A: yeah i get tons of those a week 

488.48 490.94 B: how do we get those on how do we 

492.84 493.94 A: i just 

493.30 498.48 B: get on lists like that i mean i've certainly never visited any site like that 

496.05 496.92 A: they 

498.75 500.77 A: they use um 

502.31 503.77 A: if you've ever 

503.88 509.29 A: well one is if you've ever gone to like a game room to play a game 

509.48 518.77 A: and they have a chat room attached to that particular game some people just like sit there and write down people's addresses 

519.16 526.62 A: like a._o._l. for example when you go in to play their games your name that you're playing as is your screen name 

527.35 531.19 A: so then they use that or some people just take 

531.28 532.65 A: like um 

533.08 538.88 A: they'll just take chem and they'll write chem and they'll write chem one chem two chem three 

538.93 544.44 A: and they'll do it like that and they're bound to hit somebody with a screen name like that 

544.64 551.04 B: one thing that helped to cut down on those for a while was i went in and erased all my cookies cleared my cookies 

550.63 551.61 A: right 

551.70 555.67 B: and then that helped for a while but now i'm gradually getting them back again 

554.69 556.27 A: yeah same here 

557.33 558.18 B: so 

557.71 559.18 A: it's really annoying 

559.70 563.00 A: all i do is keep hitting report spam report spam 

563.59 566.27 A: and then but mine comes up where 

566.35 569.99 A: if i report it as spam then it automatically 

570.65 571.96 A: blocks 

572.35 576.96 A: that person's address from ever sending me something again 

577.69 580.54 A: but that doesn't stop them 'cause all they do is change their name 

580.46 582.58 B: oh yeah yeah 

581.50 583.24 A: and then do it all over again 

582.91 589.67 B: and they say you shouldn't do the unsubscribe at the bottom because that just tells them that you're really there 

589.59 592.90 A: right i didn't that's what i was doing for the longest time 

590.06 591.16 B: you know 

593.27 595.81 A: i'd click on it and go unsubscribe me 

596.42 598.44 A: or i'd type them back email 

598.46 599.89 A: a nasty
