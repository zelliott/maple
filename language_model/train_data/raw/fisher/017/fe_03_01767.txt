57.05 64.97 B: (( mhm that's true that's true and now to the topic of the day like that has been assigned to us also very interesting and controversial [laughter] )) 

64.52 70.73 A: yes definitely well what's um what's your first take on the topic 

71.12 74.64 B: (( first take ah ah definitely um )) 

74.68 78.14 B: all the fundamentalist countries ah 

78.57 81.71 B: (( are a threat to ah america )) 

82.42 86.24 B: (( they somehow i i think so like fundament- )) 

86.84 95.24 B: fundamentalist countries like ah syria is one such fundamentalist country i mean even for that matter like iran is also one such 

96.81 99.40 B: (( fundamentalist country they they they )) 

101.33 109.13 B: there there are if if not the country as such that will be terrorist organization which believe in ah ah their 

110.20 116.98 B: their terrorist goals and they think that america is a is a country which is against ah 

117.75 119.67 B: (( whatever fundamental ah ah )) 

120.82 130.49 B: (( belief they have against their belief and ah they are evil and they will take they will be doing anything to the country at their own life ah )) 

131.17 133.94 B: so that is why i say that if any of 

134.15 137.12 B: those fundamentalist countries they believe in their fundamental 

138.37 139.41 B: issues 

139.03 140.71 A: mhm 

139.73 142.80 B: (( ah may be attracted to america )) 

142.82 144.83 A: mhm 

144.33 146.46 B: so what's what's your opinion 

146.15 150.49 A: well i'll tell you it's really curious i tend to um 

150.66 164.91 A: think about the question of what countries represent a threat to our country and i think that in lots of ways i make a big distinction between a threat to our 

164.89 170.70 A: country versus a threat to our way of life and um 

171.41 178.83 A: it's amazing that um until september eleventh i just really didn't think that there was a 

180.20 187.60 A: [lipsmack] set that i would live in a live in a world in which there really was some fear 

187.45 196.96 A: that some personal harm could potentially come to me or my children or my family and i think that um [mn] 

197.82 206.71 A: it's difficult for me to to understand what countries pose a risk versus certain 

206.66 219.19 A: groups and i have to admit that i don't know too much about um foreign countries and the countries the institutions of the countries um directly providing um 

219.49 226.79 A: support or directively it's directly working um or doing things that put us 

226.83 235.80 A: specifically in harm's way i mean i read news reports about certain countries providing support to terrorist fundamentalist groups 

235.99 240.73 A: and i suppose those would be the countries that concern me 

241.01 243.60 A: [lipsmack] most um 

243.73 248.99 A: but to me i'm a little bit more concerned about individuals or groups versus 

249.06 252.74 A: entities as large as a country if that makes sense 

252.21 259.71 B: (( mhm yeah yes i'm i'm absolutely right you're absolutely right and i'm also of putting of the same idea that is ah )) 

259.84 266.65 B: (( not as a country but a but a group a terrorist organizations live in these countries )) 

267.08 267.89 B: (( ah )) 

267.90 271.49 B: (( with or with total governmental knowledge are )) 

271.14 273.28 A: mhm 

271.63 272.74 B: (( a )) 

272.87 274.05 B: threat to us 

274.03 275.01 A: mhm 

274.36 279.98 B: yes ah they are the people who change the lifestyle 

280.25 290.25 B: (( ah in america particularly like america is known to have a free form of life- lifestyle so we don't fear going to a place )) 

290.02 291.48 A: mhm 

291.16 293.56 B: (( um nowadays ah ah ah )) 

293.66 300.86 B: you have to look at the next car in the parking lot as a potential threat it may blow on your face 

301.92 304.77 B: see that's that's the kind of of 

305.00 306.37 B: (( ah ah void )) 

306.41 312.69 B: (( after september elen- eleven like you are right very right so so you )) 

308.32 309.21 A: mhm 

312.90 322.93 B: you if i i if i see ah some some kind of an activity like somebody even op- opens up the bonnet and is a car that is the 

323.56 329.62 B: driver is not there i i i run away from the place or at least walk swiftly out of the place 

329.01 335.68 A: right now do you live do you live close to um excuse me do you live close to new york city 

335.02 342.26 B: (( yes it is only thirty miles and i had seen the world trade centre collapse )) 

342.00 343.64 A: oh my goodness 

343.65 349.40 A: yeah that's that's remarkable i i think the closer the closer the connection you 

349.72 358.71 A: my my feeling is that the closer that you've felt from a proximity at the same point to what happened on september eleventh 

358.84 365.70 A: the more fear i think you have so because i lived close to boston 

365.61 375.52 A: you know immediately after september eleven immediately after the towers went down that first day i can remember sitting in my office and my office is about six miles outside of boston 

375.62 377.19 A: i can remember [lipsmack] 

377.65 382.23 A: vividly hearing the lack of planes the lack of airplanes 

382.18 395.77 A: and every once in a while the air would be punctuated by the sound of jet planes all of a sudden these f16 jet planes were the only sound of plane in the air that day 

395.65 405.86 A: and yet because they were f16s they were so loud that every single time i heard a plane for the first few days there is just this fear factor 

405.81 412.69 A: because of what had happened and i think that our reactions because we both live so close to cities where 

412.99 424.72 A: like that's where it started here and ended where you are um really touched us in ways that it didn't touch someone who might live in michigan let's say 

425.31 429.10 B: mm yes that's right you are right and um i 

429.36 437.36 B: i think during those days like i worked in an office which is in manhattan right away like it was very close to the empire state building 

437.99 439.82 B: (( and )) 

438.04 441.16 A: mhm 

440.01 442.04 B: ah it was it was it was a little a little 

443.16 445.08 B: (( really ah frightening day yeah )) 

444.52 446.21 A: i can imagine 

447.15 452.63 B: yeah so that that that is why like the the fear factor has gone into the 

453.11 454.69 B: mind of 

455.52 456.62 B: (( and ah )) 

457.23 458.35 B: yes like 

459.50 461.69 B: i say i i i believe like 

463.10 468.95 B: (( [mn] there will be threat and also like it is very unfort- unfortunate that is that we )) 

469.10 475.22 B: are not able to establish the factor that we have eradicated saddam hussein and his ah group of people 

475.62 476.66 A: (( yes )) 

476.56 477.42 B: um 

477.65 480.78 B: the same is true with bin laden and ah 

481.30 482.39 B: so 

482.87 485.33 B: sort of the possibilities are 

485.99 487.40 B: ah groups 

487.76 494.77 B: ah are more groups ah growing up and developing into terrorist organizations ah 

495.86 497.41 B: (( is the reality )) 

497.24 498.16 A: yes 

497.62 498.90 B: (( and ah )) 

499.56 502.87 B: (( they may be harbored by ah )) 

503.05 505.14 B: (( the gorm- governments )) 

505.16 508.47 B: (( or may not be but ah there may be gr- )) 

508.90 511.98 B: groups which which may be funding them and ah 

513.51 516.02 B: they may be having enough ah ah 

517.18 518.49 B: funds to 

518.98 520.64 B: (( bring in harm [mn] )) 

520.32 525.81 A: yes well i think i think that one of the interesting things that um ah 

526.18 527.77 A: will be um 

528.07 536.72 A: good to watch is to see how iraq kind of falls out it concerns me that there is so much religion that gets involved 

536.66 549.17 A: in this and there's often a perception you know internationally that this is a christian attack against an islamic state and i mean i don't know about you but [mn] 

549.80 554.44 A: i don't think from an american sense it has anything to do with religion 

554.65 557.93 A: and that really concerns me 

556.07 556.83 B: (( yes )) 

557.51 570.65 B: (( yeah yeah you you true i i i would say you are you are you are perfect in ah understanding that like i say i i i am neither christian nor a ah a muslim like i say i'm i'm a hindu i come from india )) 

570.18 572.20 A: mhm 

572.25 576.69 B: (( and and we are god fearing but not fundamentalists )) 

576.59 577.66 A: right 

577.01 578.53 B: (( so ah )) 

578.56 579.92 B: see what you 

579.97 584.69 B: (( say is is true that that is why i say like these fundamental- )) 

584.74 591.38 B: fundamentalist states they start believing it is basically the christian country trying to attack a a 

591.54 597.67 B: muslim country so it is not that ah they don't view it as we are trying to mi- 

592.57 593.66 A: yes 

597.72 599.09 B: (( mitigate our )) 

599.46 599.89 B: (( risk ))
