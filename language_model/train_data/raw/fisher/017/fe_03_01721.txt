4.92 5.93 A: you too 

6.11 7.83 B: (( s- so the topic of the day is s- )) 

8.31 10.43 A: uh who we think's a threat 

10.12 11.64 B: who is a threat to us 

11.45 13.23 A: from foreign relations 

14.23 16.22 B: uh sounds absolutely fascinating 

15.25 18.40 A: i don't know if anyone's a big threat [laughter] 

19.04 21.27 A: i mean i guess anyone could be threat 

20.99 23.87 B: sure anybody could be a threat but i i think the united states 

24.07 26.26 B: military is it's pretty strong 

24.25 25.25 A: too strong 

25.62 26.98 A: yeah i agree 

26.36 29.43 B: that i don't think we have too much to worry about as far as 

29.62 32.87 B: other countries trying to 

32.45 34.30 A: sneak in like they did 

34.44 35.62 B: exactly 

34.55 37.48 A: that that's what i mean anyone could be a little threat but 

37.49 44.83 B: right that's that's correct anybody can be a little threat but the united states is in in pretty good shape based on what's just transpired in iraq and 

43.99 45.65 A: what we've seen yeah 

44.89 46.92 B: yes it didn't take very long to 

46.94 49.78 B: go in and accomplish whatever we were trying to accomplish 

50.09 56.96 B: so it looked like it was a pretty good job and i don't really think we have much of a threat or much to worry about did you 

56.16 60.00 A: i think it was quick too a lot quicker than i thought it was going to happen 

60.10 61.76 B: really think it was going a while 

61.14 66.20 A: i thought it was gonna i don't know why not that we wouldn't win but just that somehow it was going to drag on 

66.28 68.20 B: how long did you think that it was going to last for 

68.42 69.74 A: i thought a few months 

69.47 70.79 B: a few months i 

70.18 73.66 A: i thought more and more people would get called over i don't know like 

73.96 76.14 A: reserves and things like that 

76.20 77.92 B: mean i- did you think did 

76.59 79.16 A: i don't know i don't know why i thought that [laughter] 

78.76 81.63 B: did you think that quite a few body bags would be coming back 

81.30 94.22 A: i'm not yeah in a way but see w- well i know i know a lot of people where i work are in you know the national guard and they were always being called to airports and stuff and i thought that was what was going to be next that they'd be all sent over there even though they were just in the guards 

93.73 94.87 B: (( mhm )) 

94.25 96.50 A: i don't why i thought that i just did [laughter] 

96.46 97.35 B: (( [laughter] )) 

97.43 101.27 B: but it's actually turned out and it's unfortunate for those several hundred families 

101.29 110.73 B: who were were touched by tragedy but all things considering um in the time frame it was pretty pretty fast and not many lives were were lost 

101.43 102.28 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

110.34 113.88 A: and i do i think they thought they were a big threat that's for sure 

113.87 121.25 B: oh i i think so and i think uh well george bush was going in to take care of some situations that his f- his father n- never was quite able to finish 

115.16 116.48 A: (( and they were wrong )) 

118.38 119.70 A: (( that's right )) 

121.50 127.08 B: so junior junior went in there and sent his surrounded himself with the armed forces 

127.37 129.23 B: and was hopefully able to 

129.30 138.23 B: diminish what any problems he thought would occur over there but then the united states is looking at other countries now as well that could be a threat such as north korea and syria 

138.33 140.58 B: and i'm sure look at libya 

138.68 139.75 A: (( countries like )) 

139.99 141.23 A: yeah 

141.59 146.66 A: but i don't know as far as like france or any of them i don't think any of them would ever even think about [laughter] 

146.16 147.61 B: no no 

146.74 148.52 A: attacking or anything 

148.25 151.77 B: no france is france is too too much involved with selling their

159.87 164.80 A: exactly that's what some countries are worried about that's why they wouldn't attack [sigh] 

162.67 163.92 B: oh of course

335.96 342.75 B: yeah i know i know those plow guys did do quite well this year extremely well what do they charge by number of inches up there 

338.61 339.54 A: [laughter] 

342.42 345.43 A: ah no he does it by plow i have a pretty decent guy 

345.97 346.83 A: by the 

346.12 346.80 B: (( do )) 

347.26 348.42 A: the storm 

348.12 349.54 B: oh he does it by the storm 

348.96 350.13 A: yeah 

349.97 354.09 B: so so if there's twenty inches is it's one price and 

352.66 358.19 A: yeah he's i got a good guy he just charges me i mean i know some that would be like twelve inches is one price [mn] 

357.51 358.81 B: yeah 

358.30 361.82 A: no he's i've had him for a few years and he's always been decent 

361.41 365.74 B: well send him down to philly because down here they they charge based on the number of inches 

365.17 368.39 A: really it's twenty five bucks and i have a big driveway 

367.47 368.33 B: (( oh )) 

368.37 372.13 B: (( twenty five dollars these guys won't get out of bed for twenty five dollars ))

378.02 383.17 B: yeah it would i think it starts at about twenty five dollars up up to two or three inches 

382.58 384.07 A: you're kidding 

383.40 394.29 B: and then it just goes it escalates it could be tw- another twenty five dollars if it's seven inches another twenty five dollars if it's ten inches so you i mean it's not uncommon for people to have to pay a hundred dollars every time it snows 

388.96 390.74 A: (( me wow )) 

393.87 399.35 A: wow i i was complaining i paid two seventy five the whole season [laughter] [laughter]

410.52 411.40 A: [laughter] 

411.22 413.22 B: and even with the cost of fuel 

413.07 415.08 A: that's true the gas alone 

414.39 416.27 B: the gas is very expensive 

415.91 423.61 A: yep although that wa- yeah i read the gas went up because of all the problems oil the most oil i've paid for in my life 

419.91 422.02 B: (( well i guess the mhm )) 

423.12 425.02 B: so but you you have oil heating 

424.41 425.25 A: yeah 

425.45 428.73 B: and what does that cost per gallon a dollar or something mm 

427.38 436.97 A: um i have locked in at like a dollar fifteen and i bought five hundred gallons because that's all i ever use i i live you know my boyfriend comes on the weekends i'm mostly alone and 

430.14 431.00 B: (( that )) 

435.74 437.59 B: mhm 

437.36 440.28 A: i ran out by december this year 

440.48 444.45 A: so i had to pay like a dollar eighty nine or something the last two times 

444.50 445.95 B: and how long did that last you 

445.80 449.33 A: um i still have a full tank 'cause it's warmed up quite a bit 

446.68 447.43 B: does it 

448.78 451.61 B: so you went through for the winter 

451.04 452.04 A: oh about 

452.20 454.31 B: how much money you think you spent 

453.71 460.46 A: i did my initial five hundred and fifty bucks plus it was like two fifty about a thousand dollars and i've not ever done that 

459.84 462.74 B: or and that would be how many months you figure six months 

462.47 466.27 A: they fill up probably in october yeah until now 

465.93 468.75 B: so it's six months and that's twelve hundred dollars 

468.42 469.39 A: yeah 

469.43 472.80 B: yeah that's that's a that's a decent amount of money 

472.22 475.51 A: i've never spent more than six or seven hundred dollars 

475.33 481.24 B: so we had a gas bill in f- january or february that was almost five hundred dollars for one month 

480.89 482.26 A: one month w- 

481.70 485.84 B: one month it was four seventy five for one month which was the highest it's ever been 

483.95 484.60 A: (( wow )) 

485.97 489.30 B: but it was brutally cold in j- january and february 

487.34 488.62 A: (( yeah a- )) 

488.75 490.49 A: that is a lot for gas i 

490.31 492.17 B: we don't have we don't have oil 

492.53 494.50 B: just natural natural gas 

493.96 495.92 A: (( think my sister has natural gas )) 

495.64 499.71 B: and it's it gets to be either way either way it's expensive but you have to 

498.92 500.97 A: my parents have electric heat [laughter] 

500.80 502.16 B: electric heat 

501.55 502.36 A: (( yeah ))

509.08 511.36 A: i'm sure it's quite a bit a month [laughter] 

510.88 516.92 B: mhm that's quite high to have [noise] to pay to pay electric heat but n- do you have air conditioning or you don't have air conditioning 

516.35 517.84 A: no i don't 'cause
