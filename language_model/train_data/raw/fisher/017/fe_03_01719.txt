0.26 2.21 A: hello my name is rachel 

1.73 3.73 B: h- hi rachel i'm logan 

3.32 4.36 A: hi 

3.92 6.62 B: (( how are ya [laughter] )) 

4.55 5.71 A: good 

5.84 10.60 A: so i guess we're supposed to talk about what country we feel is a threat if there is one 

10.20 11.28 B: (( correct mhm )) 

11.11 13.54 A: uh i think syria is a definite threat 

13.73 16.04 A: i think iran is a definite threat 

15.81 17.09 B: mhm i would agree mhm [noise] 

16.44 22.74 A: um i think they're both uh coun- [noise] countries that are given to harboring terrorists 

22.78 24.02 A: um i 

24.68 35.46 A: was fortunate enough to spend quite a bit of time in the middle east and i know that that people in iran and syria and iraq are 

35.48 44.31 A: many of them are extremists and i don't believe that [noise] you know muslims as a whole pose any type of a problem 

43.61 45.03 B: (( mm mhm i agree mhm mhm mhm mhm )) 

44.38 53.36 A: um i i- you know i do know that uh i i was married actually to an egyptian for about ten years 

53.78 67.69 A: and i found everyone that i met in egypt to be welcoming and loving towards americans and the american way of life and they were inquisitive and they 

63.21 63.97 B: right 

67.93 82.91 A: really had no problems with americans or the american way of life um you know e- every now and then you read of an extremist and i think that those are isolated people that need to be dealt with um 

71.87 73.06 B: right right mhm 

81.37 87.82 B: mhm i agree [sigh] yeah and i would also uh add that i think korea is a definite threat 

86.73 89.44 A: [noise] [lipsmack] yes i i forgot about k- [noise] 

87.83 90.97 B: i think that kind of goes without saying [laughter] 

89.50 101.33 A: yeah k- yeah um i i think the problem with korea should have been handled years ago just as iraq should have been handled years ago before this technology became available to them 

91.01 91.75 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

97.13 98.21 B: (( right right mhm yeah i think )) 

101.29 111.67 A: um i think that um you know these type of things should have been dealt with um before they were able to get out of hand i think there are too many 

111.75 124.29 A: um people that are are just willing to say oh don't worry things will work out it i i don't think that happens i don't you know i think that there are people out there who really [lipsmack] 

124.70 127.67 A: are a threat to the united states and 

124.70 126.38 B: that mm have an agenda 

126.44 127.63 B: have an agenda 

127.81 142.68 B: true and i also think that ano- a part of the problem that that unfortunately tends to get un- un- overlooked depending on the administration is what our governments have done without our knowledge prior to things getting out of hand um what dealings they've had with certain governments 

142.74 148.35 B: uh whether it's to deal you know to say well if you join us we'll give you arms so you can go deal with russia 

148.00 155.26 A: [noise] [noise] yes i i i i believe that there you know was much of that going on um you know 

148.51 150.96 B: or whatever it is you know it's like we've 

153.37 156.64 B: mhm right playing both sides of the fence basically yeah mhm 

155.56 168.34 A: y- yes yes i think that i think you know back in the eighties and nineties there was a lot of uh you know two faced things going on back and forth and i think uh we're paying for the price for it now [lipsmack] 

161.43 162.43 B: right 

163.77 164.43 B: (( right )) 

167.07 170.05 B: unfortunately we are and on a lot of different levels mhm mhm 

169.75 176.27 A: yeah i mean i i know that you know we certainly gave guns and all types of uh 

176.67 186.27 A: munitions and technology to people that you know weren't uh capable of uh dealing with it in a responsible manner um 

177.60 178.37 B: right 

178.47 179.29 B: right 

183.44 184.79 B: (( right exactly mhm )) 

186.28 192.47 A: i think that uh a lot of the people that that we dealt with were mercenaries and they were just out to make the quick buck 

192.00 193.16 B: right 

192.53 199.97 A: and they you know took what we gave them and just turned it around and made a quick buck out of it and 

199.83 206.14 B: right whose loyalties definitely weren't with any particular government per se but just with their own with their own pockets 

202.98 204.79 A: [noise] yes 

205.54 212.80 A: with their own pockets exactly um you know i don't i don't know that we you know specifically gave anything to 

206.45 207.27 B: right 

212.73 221.94 A: you know saddam hussein but i'm sure that we gave something to someone who then turned around and sold it to him um whether that person came to us 

216.86 217.70 B: (( right mm mhm yeah mhm )) 

222.01 236.24 A: you know with the intentions of doing that i don't know but i do know that you know i'm sure that it has happened you know um i'm sure that that technology you know has has gone awry you know has has you know 

229.15 229.86 B: right 

234.08 234.94 B: right 

235.02 246.37 B: yeah i think i think part of the problem also is the simple fact that it's we see ourselves as the world power um not really as as part of a global community um and we tend to 

247.04 252.96 B: try to decide how other countries should behave or not behave based on our criteria mhm 

250.56 256.24 A: yes i i i think that i think that is true but i also think that the average american [noise] 

256.27 266.37 A: hasn't really travelled outside the united states enough to really appreciate what other countries go through on a daily basis 

258.64 259.25 B: (( mm )) 

264.43 268.56 B: oh definitely i completely agree with you we take a lot for granted mhm mm 

266.42 267.42 A: um 

267.88 269.38 A: oh we take i- 

269.44 283.56 A: so much for granted it's it's it's really quite sickening i mean first of all let me tell you i'm an american through and through and i'm never going to give up my minivan and my five t._v.s and my computer i'm never going to give them up but i can also tell you that 

278.62 281.38 B: right [laughter] [laughter] 

281.78 282.55 B: right 

283.33 289.77 A: you know i sat here watching these kids in iraq that were just grateful to get a bag of grain 

289.01 290.48 B: (( exactly mhm mhm )) 

290.13 299.31 A: when i've got a five year old who's got his own computer and you know he's got a you know all the the fancy games and everything else and i mean 

297.62 299.05 B: right right 

299.70 301.87 A: you know we have no 

300.12 305.11 B: yeah and he'll have a tantrum if doesn't get his pop tart every once in a while [laughter] 

303.03 306.97 A: yeah exactly you know we we have no idea 

306.67 307.63 B: right 

307.00 316.36 A: you know the av- i mean i do because i've you know i've been to the other side of the world i've seen you know kids picking hamburgers out of trash cans you know 

311.37 312.87 B: (( mhm right )) 

315.30 316.69 B: yeah mhm mhm 

316.47 322.97 A: um but i think the average person here in america and especially the young people 

322.39 323.30 B: mhm 

322.98 326.34 A: um they have no idea 

325.95 327.00 B: i agree mhm 

326.38 330.65 A: um of how uh the world is difficult for these people 

330.53 342.03 A: so i mean i can certainly understand the resentment that these people have you know when they look at look at a magazine or a newspaper and they see what american children have 

334.08 334.99 B: right 

335.31 336.34 B: right 

341.44 342.54 B: right 

341.89 345.23 A: and their own children are are dying of disease i mean 

344.48 345.29 B: right 

345.02 356.91 A: you know i i i thought it was incredible uh we were in egypt a couple of years ago and there was a kid that while we were there in the course of a week we heard of four different children that were electrocuted 

356.62 357.39 B: mm 

357.38 368.38 A: you know from either plugging something in or plugging you know a light in or whatever i mean when was the last time you ever heard of anybody in america being electrocuted you know it's because they don't have the education 

359.27 360.09 B: right 

360.96 361.90 B: right 

364.42 365.58 B: true true 

368.53 378.71 A: i mean they you know they run their their public service announcements on t._v. are about not swimming in the nile because the water is polluted i mean [sigh] 

376.89 377.73 B: (( mhm mhm mm )) 

379.00 380.20 B: yeah 

379.59 385.59 A: you know what i mean it's just just incredible you know the things that these people have to go through on a daily basis 

383.50 384.25 B: mhm 

384.95 393.13 B: right and i i don't know what's going to i mean i know bush i- if he was given the chance he would go to war with every single country that he thought was a threat 

393.20 405.11 B: um whether an actual threat a a a potential threat or whatever i mean he's obviously proven that even if you are a potential uh enemy that you're up for being invaded 

405.05 414.72 A: i think he has definitely demonstrated that he's not here to fool around and he's he's gonna make good on you know whatever he said he was going to do 

405.19 405.98 B: um 

409.24 410.62 B: right 

414.30 415.33 B: right 

414.73 419.09 A: um whether that's a good thing or not i don't know um 

417.04 417.98 B: mhm 

418.23 428.68 B: well i think in theory it sounds really great but i don't think when you look at the economic realities of what our country is going through i don't know where you are but um i'm in new york city 

428.78 431.70 B: and we're getting hit really really hard 

431.12 432.18 A: oh yeah

434.06 439.56 A: yeah i mean i'm i'm in um you know north central massachusetts in a very small town 

439.14 439.99 B: right 

439.70 442.54 A: you know so we're in a small town and we 

442.62 449.27 A: have you know virtually no business in our town so our taxes come out of people's pockets 

445.46 446.55 B: (( right yeah )) 

448.61 449.88 B: exactly yeah mhm 

449.22 458.42 A: and unfortunately you know our school system is a disaster you know our our high school kids if they wanna play football have to pay fifteen hundred dollars 

457.79 459.25 B: oh my goodness 

458.65 460.34 A: i mean it's you know it's [mn] 

460.62 462.36 B: oh jeeze yeah

474.01 477.18 B: right right right yeah exactly exactly 

478.01 478.86 B: (( right mhm )) 

482.70 487.77 A: um so yes our economy is is really you know seeing tough times 

487.81 488.85 A: but 

488.32 494.54 B: yeah yeah even though i would love to say hey yeah let's go and invade syria [laughter] i if we 

492.25 504.70 A: well i don't know i was just i was just reading something where they found six hundred million american dollars behind a wall in one of the palaces well gee there's half the budget 

495.18 495.99 B: (( ah )) 

499.04 499.86 B: mm 

501.84 502.60 B: (( hm )) 

504.05 507.52 B: (( there you go [laughter] )) 

505.97 509.81 A: i think we can i think we can finance this war now 

508.06 518.31 B: [laughter] [laughter] oh no [laughter] so that would be a huge kettle of fish if we just said oh by the way that's ours [laughter] to the victor go the spoils 

511.38 514.16 A: i mean it seems to me that that 

516.32 519.18 A: well they are american dollars 

518.52 529.36 B: well true but then they weren't in the possession of the [laughter] americans at the time [laughter] that would i think that would definitely cause a problem with considering uh that the people of iraq are actually starving right now 

529.11 534.16 A: well yes i you know i i understand that you know but uh [lipsmack] 

529.64 531.19 B: [laughter]

535.23 536.26 B: um 

536.46 537.31 A: but 

536.48 545.21 B: yeah i don't know i just i just don't feel comfortable giving um well first of all i think it's it's it's a little um two faced in the sense that 

545.41 550.22 B: we are saying to these countries you cannot have weapons of mass destruction 

550.38 552.06 B: but we have them 

550.55 553.28 A: and yes yes 

552.26 565.94 B: it's saying everybody's who's in our camp and plays our games can have them but you can't i understand the fundamental extremists uh who are out there who would use them for very negative purposes but at the same time i think it's definitely 

556.43 557.22 A: (( right [noise] )) 

561.82 562.75 A: mhm 

566.07 572.90 B: [sigh] like i said two faced to say well you can have it and you can have it but you cannot either we all have to disarm
