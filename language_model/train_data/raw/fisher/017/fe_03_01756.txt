23.83 27.62 A: yeah [laughter] yeah most of them out there 

28.19 30.02 A: not good countries 

29.78 41.99 B: i know that iran was um pretty ticked off to ah to put it lightly but ah i know that they were pretty mad when one of the stray missiles actually went into their country and i was hoping that they weren't 

39.65 40.77 A: yeah 

41.87 47.26 B: going to retaliate you know in in some manner to either us or to the iraqi people 

47.00 48.29 A: yeah 

47.70 48.67 B: but ah 

49.54 58.06 B: now a a lot seems to be coming up with syria and letting people um like the higher ups of iraq go over there so 

58.08 63.44 B: i kind of wonder well are they friends or are they not you know do they have something up their sleeves 

63.63 67.90 A: i know north korea has a lot of chemical weapons 

67.48 68.93 B: yeah exactly 

68.68 69.69 A: so 

69.90 72.31 A: and they don't like us very much [laughter] 

71.54 72.84 B: no [laughter] 

72.98 78.93 B: south korea was okay i don't have a problem with south korea because they seem to be on our side in in a manner but 

77.95 80.80 A: so yeah well we have taken care of them for so long 

80.59 81.84 B: yeah exactly 

82.83 83.71 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

82.98 86.34 B: yeah north korea has a a lot on their 

86.42 87.64 B: on their end 

87.93 88.67 B: so 

89.27 100.47 B: i have been worried about that i mean i don't i don't know how far you know certain weapons can reach though i'm not that like into it but of course i worry about myself and my country and everybody else but 

101.74 104.70 B: i i don't know how much damage they could really do to us 

105.50 107.36 A: um i don't know 

107.90 111.65 B: like can they really like shoot something from over there and hit us or 

112.52 116.03 A: i think they would probably catch it before it got all the way over here 

115.45 116.31 B: right 

117.53 121.87 A: and they did that for a long time in kuwait city 

117.77 118.98 B: that's scary 

122.23 123.04 B: right 

122.65 124.05 A: intercepting 

124.13 125.24 A: missiles 

125.26 127.24 B: yeah they have been doing an awesome job 

127.35 128.84 A: (( [laughter] )) 

129.64 131.76 A: yeah 

132.28 134.55 A: yeah there then i mean

136.80 137.75 B: yeah 

137.83 139.14 A: don't know 

139.85 147.50 B: they wanted us to read that we're against us going in there i mean i know there was france i think there was germany and was it russia or was it somebody else 

147.50 148.95 A: i don't know 

148.98 151.02 A: i don't remember i mean it's 

152.23 156.44 B: i don't think really france that we have anything to worry about i think that they were just 

156.41 159.93 A: france is just kind of scared to i think 

158.90 159.79 B: yeah 

159.98 163.83 A: to get into it but i mean they're over there helping us now so i 

163.12 163.95 B: right 

164.58 166.01 A: think it was just 

166.81 171.96 A: i had seen on the news too that supposedly france was covering up 

172.42 174.69 A: stuff that they were doing like selling 

174.90 175.96 A: um 

176.99 178.91 A: like missiles and 

179.32 185.67 A: stuff like that to yeah to iraq which is why they didn't want to 

180.61 181.46 B: really 

183.18 183.86 B: huh 

186.47 187.33 A: um 

188.41 190.82 A: do anything because it was going to hurt them 

190.66 192.59 B: (( right yeah that's right )) 

192.81 196.44 A: but i mean i don't know how much of that is true either so 

197.08 199.32 B: you can't believing everything on the news [laughter] 

198.77 200.93 A: (( [laughter] uh-huh )) 

200.96 203.72 A: no just 'cause it's on the news doesn't mean it's true 

203.52 204.46 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

204.59 208.25 A: [laughter] so yeah i mean 

208.44 211.00 B: i think we have more friends than we do foes 

208.45 210.37 A: i don't think france is anything 

210.96 211.73 A: huh 

211.52 214.77 B: i think we have more friends than we do foes in in terms of 

214.82 215.98 B: (( you know countries )) 

215.00 219.03 A: yeah but the foes that we do have are pretty scary 

218.57 222.59 B: yeah yeah they're pretty powerful they they know their stuff yeah 

222.80 224.95 A: (( yeah )) 

225.04 225.89 A: (( they're )) 

226.32 230.06 A: and they're all ruled by guys that have no conscious 

226.36 227.08 B: you 

230.20 231.12 A: conscience 

231.60 232.50 B: got it 

232.71 234.04 A: [laughter] 

232.82 235.13 B: do you think that iraq is still a 

235.42 236.85 B: a threat to us 

236.78 237.57 A: (( who )) 

237.68 238.56 B: iraq 

238.47 239.75 A: i don't think so 

240.84 242.32 B: i mean i hope they stop 

240.90 244.37 A: i think that if they would have done something they would have done it a long time ago 

244.25 245.06 B: right 

245.22 246.57 A: because i don't think 

247.52 249.28 A: i don't think um 

250.08 254.40 A: they really communicate too well with their military anyway you know 

253.66 254.44 B: right 

254.96 257.67 A: i don't think they're gonna do much to us any more 

257.72 270.75 B: i'm just still wondering if they actually have something over there that we haven't found yet or if they are just waiting for kind of like the calm to come over the country and that the the biggest stuff is over and then boom all of a sudden they will attack us or 

265.35 266.53 A: mhm 

270.79 272.53 A: yeah they could i mean 

272.59 273.56 A: (( it would be )) 

274.62 278.04 A: i don't know though i don't think they would any more 

278.47 279.52 B: i hope not 

279.50 283.33 A: i don't either i do too i mean but i mean 

283.72 287.14 A: i would have thought that they would have retaliated already by now 

286.82 287.59 B: yeah 

289.05 290.15 A: i don't know 

291.59 295.08 B: no i just think that right now like you said iran is a big threat 

295.04 297.11 A: iran i think is the biggest 

296.87 297.68 B: right 

298.69 299.80 B: (( and ah )) 

299.57 305.31 A: they say that i mean out of the top three dictators he is probably he is in the top three 

305.52 306.54 B: oh okay 

306.56 309.53 A: and i think the one from saudi arabia is too 

309.58 311.48 B: right yeah yeah that one is 

312.90 319.33 A: and i don't remember what the other one is but i know those two supposedly they are worse than saddam hussein 

319.41 320.14 B: (( mhm )) 

320.72 321.79 B: (( that's not good )) 

321.54 322.75 A: so i don't know 

323.44 331.58 B: i don't really know i don't know if i should worry well not me myself but i don't know if syria would really be a big problem i think they are more just 

332.32 333.52 B: (( ah i don't )) 

334.02 335.16 B: (( know how to put it )) 

335.58 344.70 B: i guess they kind of want to be a friend in a way to iraq and you know helping like the people come over and and get out of harms way so that they can or if they were really 

345.25 348.96 B: doing bad by letting the the leaders come in 

348.73 350.01 A: mhm 

350.50 353.55 B: i don't know if if they could go either way i would think 

353.49 354.60 A: yeah 

353.92 359.41 B: but i don't i don't think that they are big enough or they really have that kind of military power to 

359.86 361.70 B: (( to do anything to us to harm )) 

360.80 365.15 A: i don't think they do but i think they have are are we talking about iran 

365.43 366.73 B: us syria 

366.25 370.78 A: oh syria yeah i don't know but they have pretty some pretty scary 

371.69 374.40 A: chemical weapons i mean they wouldn't need much 

374.12 374.93 B: right 

376.17 379.96 A: just even that mustard gas is pretty ga- pretty bad 

379.11 379.73 B: (( yeah )) 

382.29 387.18 B: it was scary watching everybody prepare to go over there with all the gas masks and and 

386.07 388.70 A: oh yeah well 

387.63 388.28 B: (( their )) 

389.21 392.90 A: i had my my my husband was in the marine corp 

392.99 393.82 B: mhm 

393.87 394.82 A: so 

395.28 396.95 A: i mean he got out like 

397.29 399.13 A: two or three weeks after 

400.07 401.54 A: september eleventh 

401.40 402.63 B: (( oh okay )) 

402.61 409.61 A: so yeah we were kind of worried that they were gonna call him back in but they never did so 

407.97 409.09 B: oh right 

410.72 415.01 A: that was a good thing but i still have friends that have husbands over there right now 

414.80 415.66 B: right 

416.06 418.48 B: that's got to be so hard i can only imagine 

418.35 419.62 A: (( yeah )) 

418.49 430.96 B: my husband's a voluntary fire fighter and i guess we're in central new jersey so when the towers got hit and they were actually my husband's department was actually one of the first that they called to go over there so so it kind of 

429.26 430.64 A: oh really 

430.98 435.51 B: a- affected us i guess in the same way that it would for you and and your husband so 

434.93 436.48 A: mhm 

437.16 444.60 B: i just worry about something like that happening again but i i don't know anybody who would take that risk again what other countries if if they do then 

444.14 445.62 A: oh yeah they're all 

445.08 448.38 B: (( they're going to be pretty much screwed [laughter] )) 

446.46 450.09 A: yeah [laughter] yeah i don't think they would do it again 

450.51 452.76 A: and if they did i don't know they're pretty dumb 

453.62 458.68 A: because they know that bush isn't gonna just sit back and take it 

458.08 461.50 B: i i think he's done a pretty good job i don't think that he's 

461.64 468.15 B: like he could be better i know it's a totally different topic but i think he's handling the war and how he ah 

468.17 472.41 B: i guess confronting the country so i think he's doing a really good job with it but 

472.87 477.86 A: yeah i don't know i think they just criticize him because he's the one that's in the spotlight right now 

477.32 478.09 B: yeah 

479.00 481.48 A: and some people talk and they don't even know 

482.50 484.85 A: what they're talking about really 

484.22 485.00 B: right 

486.44 487.22 A: but 

487.36 488.55 A: (( yeah )) 

487.97 491.42 B: yeah i'm glad that we we did what we had to do over there i'm glad that 

491.10 493.96 A: yeah i don't think he had another choice 

491.48 493.13 B: (( there is some sort of peace )) 

493.88 494.71 B: right 

497.27 498.22 A: um 

499.31 506.95 A: yeah but as far as like i think the biggest ones are iran and north korea [noise] 

506.18 506.97 B: right 

508.91 513.27 B: north korea's really scary i mean the the way that they are over there if you 

513.90 515.96 B: i watch them on the news um 

516.07 518.95 B: just looking at them i don't know they just come across 

519.42 524.77 B: with no feelings or with nothing they just have like these straight looks on their face and 

521.00 522.17 A: yeah 

523.97 525.26 A: mhm 

525.30 527.76 B: they just don't care which is really 

527.34 531.46 A: well they have no conscience and they don't you know 

529.23 530.13 B: (( right i )) 

533.25 538.24 A: they just think that they need to do that to get what they want and 

538.61 540.84 A: i don't think they care about much else 

542.21 543.80 B: just don't understand how 

543.92 545.54 B: people can live like that 

545.60 550.07 B: they're just yeah right you know if you kill a whole bunch of people ah so be it you know 

549.56 550.77 A: yeah 

550.38 552.39 B: i i don't think they'll get that 

554.27 557.61 A: it's just just the way they are raised too you can't really 

558.48 562.15 A: it's kind of hard to blame a group of people when they don't know anything different 

561.83 562.61 B: right 

563.32 573.26 B: but i guess it's the same as some of the iraqis too they they don't know they don't understand like this whole new freedom so to speak you know they're like ah they don't understand the looting 

565.85 566.89 A: mhm 

572.54 575.64 A: yeah you can't blame them 

574.51 580.66 B: i don't blame them for what they're doing but at the same time it's like hey wait those are people who have businesses you know 

580.71 582.24 A: yeah 

581.59 584.55 B: you are just taking right from them you know those are your own people 

584.62 586.22 A: yeah 

586.25 591.63 A: they just i mean they're they're just they just um brain wash them so bad i think that you know 

591.03 591.81 B: right 

593.12 596.74 B: and so many are still scared that is he is gonna wind up back in power 

596.51 599.35 A: mhm i don't think he will ever be back in power
