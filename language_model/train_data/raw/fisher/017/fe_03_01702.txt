0.16 4.04 B: hi my name's erica i'm from california 

3.88 7.05 A: hi erica i'm sam i'm from illinois 

7.08 8.47 B: nice to meet you 

8.30 9.67 A: you too 

9.38 10.22 B: [laughter] 

10.87 11.82 B: okay 

10.95 13.96 A: so do you support what's going on over there 

14.29 17.06 B: um yes i do 

17.70 27.23 B: um i think that they have a different culture and you know different beliefs and different traditions so we can't expect things to go 

27.36 29.28 B: as planned down there 

29.88 40.20 B: um they're they're they're not used to what what we're used to they have different values so it's going to take a lot of effort and i think that 

40.24 43.08 B: uh well go ahead what do you think [laughter] 

43.88 46.93 A: well no go ahead and finish up what you're saying [noise] 

46.16 50.09 B: okay and then also um 

50.76 55.49 B: i think that it is unnecessary that we're doing as much as 

55.51 60.96 B: as we are down there but i think it's it's great that america 

61.16 65.59 B: does that um to try to restore the government 

62.88 65.12 A: why why do you think 

65.63 69.98 A: why do you think it's unnecessary what we're doing as much as we're doing 

68.43 69.48 B: (( um )) 

69.72 71.28 B: w- well because we 

71.20 83.73 B: our primary was just to go after saddam hussein but instead we are um going there and we we've made it into helping the people which i think is wonderful but you kn- you know 

83.58 93.59 B: there's the argument that what about you know the home front and other countries i mean 'cause we are spending a lot of money there but i fully support what they're doing 

93.50 99.72 B: but they didn't have to go all out like that but i really am happy and proud that they did 

100.91 101.98 A: i see 

102.52 103.73 A: well i 

104.41 107.33 A: [lipsmack] i know they're different cultures and everything 

106.84 108.30 B: yeah 

107.68 113.74 A: but i i think that the united states knows that you know and i think that 

112.27 113.21 B: right 

113.81 117.58 A: uh sometimes we've got to introduce other ideas 

118.01 120.02 A: uh to other cultures 

120.18 124.71 A: when when things are so bad in their country they have been 

125.15 129.37 A: ruled and brainwashed and everything else you know 

128.95 129.96 B: right 

130.42 140.62 B: i think that it will help if we introduce it but you know like new things um new ideas sometimes they'll be rejected first and it'll take some time to sink in 

130.75 131.61 A: (( so )) 

141.16 146.71 B: so i think peace will eventually come out of it but you know it may take a while [laughter] 

146.81 147.80 A: (( [noise] right )) 

148.55 149.44 A: well 

148.72 153.07 B: 'cause they already wanna have like another religious leader in there 

153.23 154.36 A: mhm 

153.98 156.00 B: and they have the religious 

156.23 161.95 B: you know separations the sheiks or s- shiites from the other 

162.02 165.56 B: from the bath party and stuff [laughter] 

166.02 169.42 A: well i know i- i- it's hard because um 

170.34 178.49 A: a lot of people are tossed my boyfriend and i are real tossed he's just totally against it over there altogether you know he just 

177.90 179.35 B: yeah 

178.97 184.20 A: everything i want peace i want peace i want peace and i go well yeah we all want peace you know 

183.75 184.98 B: right 

184.34 189.14 A: but we want peace for everybody not just for us and 

187.92 190.15 B: is he is he anti war 

190.25 192.55 A: yeah he's very 

190.84 196.83 B: yeah i have the same thing with my boyfriend we've gotten in so many arguments about it that we had to stop talking about it [noise] 

197.90 201.33 A: yeah that's that's what's going on here you know and 

201.95 209.48 A: and i don't know if he thinks that i'm cruel or what no i don't want to see people get hurt and killed from either side you know [mn] 

208.73 210.30 B: yes i agree 

210.05 216.93 A: but um i i can't stand by and watch our country be blown up and have to live in fear 

211.13 212.09 B: i think 

216.82 217.77 B: right 

217.06 224.10 A: of when is it going to happen again because of some insane person in another country [noise] you know 

220.77 221.34 B: (( [cough] )) 

223.73 235.42 B: yeah and i think that the end result that we're trying to achieve is peace but sometimes i mean what were we what were we supposed to do with saddam hussein i mean nothing else was working with him 

235.50 247.58 B: so i i don't know i they say sometimes that maybe there is a different way to go about it but i think we're letting too much time passing by and letting him get away with too much a- with no result 

235.57 236.52 A: right 

248.46 249.22 B: but 

248.56 252.40 A: well yeah i my i agree wholeheartedly and and 

249.28 250.03 B: yeah 

252.60 263.58 A: one thing you know is when i heard that we went to war the first thing i did was just sit down and cry because i've got two eighteen year old boys and 

262.97 264.40 B: yeah 

263.97 277.28 A: the first one is crying mom i'm scared i'm scared i'll get killed the first day over there if i'm drafted [sigh] you know he's just a total wimp and his twin brother just the opposite is 

271.31 272.32 B: yeah 

273.53 274.39 B: right 

277.34 277.90 B: (( [mn] )) 

277.41 283.87 A: oh w- war i gotta get down there and sign up i gotta get over there and fight for my country you know 

283.49 284.78 B: yeah 

284.16 286.26 A: and [mn] 

286.27 291.41 A: i know that when i was eighteen i was married and i thought i was all grown up 

291.51 300.85 A: and i was a woman and knew everything you know and now i'm forty eight and i look back and see my kids and 

301.38 304.03 A: they're just kids you know 

302.98 303.93 B: yeah 

304.35 306.65 A: they're they're not 

306.71 314.47 A: mentally emotionally or physically developed enough to go over and be doing that sort of thing and 

313.05 321.43 B: i mean i'm sure some of them have never you know been to another country before until now i mean it's totally different and i it's 

319.97 322.47 A: yeah yeah and 

321.67 324.57 B: it's overwhelming i'm sure and 

323.81 332.94 A: the training wasn't proper you know they're not trained proper enough to go over there thank god we haven't lost a lot 

332.51 334.33 B: yeah thank god for that 

333.57 335.52 A: but um 

335.04 337.13 B: on both sides [laughter] 

336.48 338.30 A: right right 

337.62 347.18 B: yeah and i guess people die over there every day i mean the most of the country i think like seventy five percent of the country is actually uh 

347.27 349.83 B: uh kids people under eighteen 

350.03 351.25 A: mhm 

350.91 352.60 B: and um 

352.92 356.65 B: maybe we're going to help give them more peace than they've had 

356.67 367.96 B: that would and that's what we want and i would i'd be really proud if we could do that and i know we're trying and i'm sure that it's sh- it's showing some good so 

368.85 369.86 A: right 

370.80 383.85 A: well i pray every day you know that that there's peace that settles quickly and [sigh] and that there can just be a meeting of the minds and and um something that comes good out of it you know 

377.03 377.95 B: yeah 

383.55 384.51 B: (( yes )) 

385.07 392.95 B: have they they if you've ever have you ever talked to someone from you know one of those eastern middle eastern countries 

385.33 386.45 A: (( but )) 

392.84 395.37 A: oh yeah our town is full of them 

393.63 394.65 B: yeah 

395.14 397.72 B: they yeah they have um 

398.15 398.76 B: (( ah )) 

398.80 402.74 B: such different traditions and values sometimes 

402.81 403.71 B: than 

403.23 405.71 A: but you know to talk to them 

406.33 408.72 A: they're thankful to be out of there 

408.59 413.79 B: [mn] that's true or sometimes they're upset because they had to leave and they didn't want to leave 

410.16 412.26 A: they are thankful to be 

413.69 415.88 A: right and 

415.29 418.19 B: because of the conditions down there so 

417.18 421.38 A: and it's sad with what's going on with them here because 

421.44 423.88 A: of the country that they're from 

424.02 433.89 A: uh many people if they're business owners their businesses have gone way down and of course everybody's has but theirs has s- seen a more drastic change 

433.92 437.19 A: and the way that they're treated and looked upon you know 

436.94 438.13 B: yeah 

437.30 441.83 A: well they can't help wh- who they were born to or where they were born 

442.05 444.76 A: it could be us just as easily as them 

445.23 449.35 A: you know we're just fortunate that we were born american 

449.24 450.29 B: right 

450.13 451.41 A: but um 

451.40 464.48 B: come to think of it it probably is our duty once we go in there i mean are we supposed to leave them like that i mean they need help you know those are people without water and food and the poverty i mean 

459.66 461.80 A: right exactly 

464.89 471.18 B: we c- it is i guess it is our duty when we see something like that to help out 'cause we can't leave them like that 

471.48 473.82 A: exactly exactly 

472.38 477.11 B: it's not it's not it's just not american exactly [laughter] 

477.12 479.20 B: (( but i don't )) 

478.52 488.85 A: i don't think that we're trying to make them become american or give up their cultures or their beliefs i think that we're just trying to help them see that there is light 

482.64 483.70 B: right 

489.42 495.15 A: on the other end of the tunnel and they do have choices that they can make 

494.80 496.04 B: yeah 

495.41 496.58 A: and um 

497.30 499.50 A: we're not there to 

499.60 505.88 A: give them bread but teach them how to grow the wheat you know what i'm saying to make their own bread 

504.46 505.46 B: i i 

505.92 509.49 B: yeah i i agree that we're we're not trying to 

509.55 513.14 B: um americanize them or anything 

513.68 517.27 B: but we're trying to help their government be more stable 

517.92 521.10 B: i mean we took out the government [laughter] you know so 

520.99 526.12 A: right now how old are is your boyfriend is he at the age where he might go over there 

521.84 522.66 B: (( so )) 

523.98 524.76 B: he's 

525.55 529.42 B: he's twenty two um i i don't think he would ever 

527.37 528.28 A: mhm 

529.50 531.05 B: go over there [laughter] 

531.72 533.68 A: unless he was drafted 

533.09 544.70 B: i i have some friends um i don't think any of them are over there maybe i know one of them is actually um and he was more of an acquaintance i look for him on t._v. i haven't seen him [laughter] 

544.84 546.00 B: but um 

546.63 555.64 B: yeah it i don't think luckily we don't have to go through the draft i don't think we're going to have to hopefully not unless there's further problems with other countries 

554.20 555.30 A: [noise] 

555.66 561.87 A: yeah well at first i thought we would but i don't think we're going to now 

561.69 563.12 B: yeah 

562.53 567.27 A: i think they've done a pretty good job of going in strong 

567.90 572.53 A: once they made the decision to go but i think the decision was delayed way too long 

572.12 573.57 B: i agree 

573.22 579.43 A: to go over there but i think they did go in strong and they made a good point right off the bat 

579.64 580.94 A: and um 

581.95 588.23 A: they're trying i think you know i don't wanna just see it come into another [noise] political war like vietnam 

588.55 590.76 A: that war was so stupid 

589.06 590.05 B: yeah 

590.80 591.84 B: yes 

591.08 592.02 A: um 

592.58 598.40 A: but yeah i i think that i support it support it wholeheartedly
