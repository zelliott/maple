120.10 121.23 A: (( [noise] i see )) 

121.67 127.16 A: yeah in fact in terms of threats from the other countries um 

128.19 135.84 A: maybe all of the c- other countries may will be a threat in some respects and um like it depends upon w- th- th- 

136.03 146.41 A: what kind of threat we are talking about like kind of a terrorist act or an economical um dominancy or ah any other threats 

146.42 152.06 A: i mean to be honest i think ah european union is going to be a threat 

152.26 156.76 A: ah in some manner in terms of the economy in u._s._a. 

156.48 157.61 B: mhm 

157.38 160.09 A: when compared to euro with dollar 

160.16 161.29 B: (( mhm 'kay )) 

160.19 175.08 A: for instance there's a lot i observed around the world ah and particularly in turkey um for instance like previously dollar was more valuable than any other currency that we have in turkey but right now i guess there it's [noise] 

175.03 177.87 A: i mean the difference between the euro and the dollar 

178.16 180.57 A: is increasing day by day 

180.72 190.75 A: and people like psychologically um [noise] buying euros rather than dollar and some of dollar is not increasing any more 

180.80 181.80 B: okay 

189.31 190.20 B: (( [noise] )) 

190.96 192.23 B: (( [noise] [noise] okay )) 

191.29 200.54 A: so i mean maybe i'm it's a little bit theoretical but ah this may be a threat to the whole country um in in terms of economy 

201.73 202.73 B: mhm 

203.92 207.88 A: ah what do you think about it [laughter] i mean [noise] [noise] 

204.16 204.93 B: (( hm )) 

207.01 215.93 B: yeah maybe maybe the economy well i guess i thought of it as a threat i thought of it as ah more of ah terrorist thing and whatever 

215.89 225.24 B: that's kinda what i thought of i didn't think of the economy thing so i thought it was terrorist related and um i think korea's defiantly a threat 

225.46 237.35 B: and i think a lot of countries are aiding terrorist countries that we don't know about for example france and places like that so i think americans are too trusting like let's everyone in 

235.54 236.92 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] mhm [noise] mhm )) 

237.57 242.31 B: let's everyone in and support them yeah that's how i look at it as 

240.36 241.51 A: [laughter] 

241.72 243.84 A: [laughter] well in fact 

242.80 247.25 B: so i think we've been idiots in many ways like let's trust everyone we meet 

243.94 244.73 A: mhm 

247.40 249.09 B: let's embrace everyone 

249.25 250.37 B: (( you know what i mean )) 

250.17 252.08 A: (( [noise] mhm mhm yeah )) 

250.68 252.27 B: been too trusting 

252.52 256.04 B: and you know we've helped bad guys and things like that 

252.82 253.85 A: yeah but mhm 

255.91 262.91 A: yeah but do you think france will be a threat um i mean particularly like party time [laughter] 

259.78 268.65 B: oh pshaw not a threat maybe not a threat but i think their aiding countries and um defiantly i don't think they're to be trusted 

268.65 274.70 B: i think no- i don't trust i'm the type of person i don't trust anybody anyway by my nature i trust no one 

272.44 273.75 A: mhm mm mhm 

274.57 286.15 B: except my husband and my family and a few close friends um i'm kinda the type of person that i think everyone is out to get me [laughter] that sounds terrible but i don't trust anybody and i think we're too trusting 

281.04 283.47 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

283.70 290.22 A: (( [mn] [laughter] [laughter] no it's okay maybe this is reality though that we should consider but you know )) 

290.02 293.28 B: yeah exactly now what religion are you since you're from turkey 

293.21 297.62 A: [laughter] um well the the religion in turkey is kind of 

297.73 308.58 A: practiced differently even though i mean um we all say that we are muslims [noise] to be honest my family was not um into religion in in any particular way 

302.51 303.31 B: (( ahah )) 

308.35 309.29 B: oh 

309.15 312.30 A: [laughter] so somehow i can't say that i have a religion 

312.21 313.40 B: (( oh okay )) 

312.40 320.00 A: maybe i can say i'm agnostic or um not i'll tell you because i do believe is another kind of religion that you just believe 

319.49 322.66 B: well what does your p- what were your parents raised or what were they 

320.43 321.22 A: that 

323.28 327.54 A: my friends um since i was from the capital 

327.62 336.23 A: like there are some people who believe in god and um in islam and practices in some manner 

336.62 344.13 A: but generally my friends they were kind of indifferent um we have like other concerns other than the religion [laughter] even though i 

340.28 341.32 B: oh 

343.45 344.98 B: isn't that interesting 

344.98 349.66 A: guess it's i mean from russia maybe i mean 

348.90 349.93 B: (( mhm )) 

349.85 353.94 A: because there are basically two um strong political 

354.25 362.11 A: um parties like one of them is on the right and the other one is extremely on the left and if you're kind of not um 

357.78 358.81 B: okay 

362.49 370.11 A: conservative and if you want to be open minded you need to select the left side and it somehow requires um you to 

370.48 377.27 A: um quit having your religious um thoughts in in your ideologically in terms of politics 

376.87 378.04 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

378.07 379.44 A: so i mean 

380.44 393.36 A: personally i feel it's like that but on the other hand i do respect um everyone's um religious thoughts and i think they should practice this in any way but particularly i don't buy any of these [laughter] 

387.13 388.26 B: oh yeah 

393.86 405.69 A: i mean maybe it's the way ah that i was grown up um i mean my grandmamma grandfather they were the same like me and it can be the influence of and old russia i don't know 

405.62 406.84 B: (( mhm )) 

406.21 410.95 A: but it's just the way that i um that we practiced the religion 

410.85 416.84 A: and in some manner if you ask the muslim countries like the ar the arab the arabic countries 

416.34 417.35 B: yeah 

416.69 426.23 A: they never consider us as muslim [laughter] like they never consider the turkish people as like muslim peop- i mean islamic um 

419.56 420.81 B: they never what 

422.82 423.59 B: (( mhm )) 

425.90 426.94 B: oh 

426.55 427.78 A: people 

428.04 429.94 A: but on the other hand i mean 

430.02 436.58 A: we have much more um cultural influence from islam islamic c- culture 

436.71 441.19 A: than um i mean christian or [mn] any other culture surrounds [noise] 

440.91 453.95 B: yeah that's interesting so i'd be curious to know what you think of americans because of with all this stuff going on you have your anti americans you have your people that love america you have you know what i mean [mn] i'm just curious as t- well since you're over here what you think of the whole thing 

455.10 459.66 B: because it's interesting hearing from someone like you because you you grew up in a different place 

460.18 461.13 A: (( [sigh] yes )) 

463.20 464.75 A: [mn] so um 

465.24 469.05 A: what i think about this anti american um thoughts around the world 

468.70 472.87 B: well yeah exactly or w- how do you feel about america since you've gotten to see everything 

472.33 475.37 A: mhm well in fact um 

475.93 482.09 A: most of the things on the media i think they are just like oof especially the political perspectives 

482.44 483.38 B: (( [mn] ahah )) 

483.26 494.02 A: i think they're kind of f- i thought of them a little bit fake like fake in the sense that for instance france wanted the peace when we were in the war with iraq 

493.79 494.74 B: yeah 

494.13 507.62 A: or germany b- simply because they recognize that they are not going to gain anything like after the war or though the war and they were kind of into um into i mean they were against to the war with iraq 

507.90 511.19 A: so i find their perspective a little bit fake 

511.34 512.80 A: (( like a little bit political )) 

511.44 513.04 B: (( [mn] oh yeah )) 

513.05 518.96 A: because it wasn't like big for them the iraq so they didn't really care 

519.01 530.30 A: and they used us in their politics um and on the other hand from the american perspective i've i kind of find bush's idea a little bit ah controversy to the 

530.42 533.45 A: general public's ideas and um 

533.65 536.12 A: i find them a little bit ah fake too 

536.17 537.24 B: (( mm )) 

536.51 539.69 A: i mean do you see what i mean everything seems like a little political 

539.90 547.88 B: yeah you know what i don't know if you feel the same way but i get tired of talking and hearing about the whole thing i was hoping we could be on a more exciting topic [laughter] 

546.79 549.44 A: [noise] [laughter] yeah i'm sure [laughter] 

547.95 551.93 B: [laughter] you know i thought it was going to be about toys i know this is so idiotic but 

550.77 556.18 A: (( [laughter] oh you're [laughter] )) 

552.59 555.15 B: (( i thought we were going to talk about toys )) 

555.31 561.10 B: i know that sounds goofy but i'd have more fun talking about toys we grew up with and enjoyed does that sound silly 

558.46 560.21 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

560.32 565.20 A: [laughter] [laughter] no it's not really maybe it's much more exciting [laughter] 

564.10 566.66 B: i know so now are you married with kids 

566.66 570.22 A: ah no i'm not married [laughter] no not really [laughter]
