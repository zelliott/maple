0.38 8.37 B: hi my name is stephanie seymour i'm uh calling in response to answer today's question do i think any other countries 

8.41 19.38 B: are a threat to the united states [sigh] ah i really don't think any other countries ah aside those in the middle east who have m- muslim extremism 

19.66 26.99 B: um will be a threat and also north korea and also those who probably practice extreme communism 

28.17 35.63 B: ah but what i think is mm what i think is that there are 

35.75 43.22 B: uh some groups in europe who probably don't support what the u._s. is doing i mean aside from france and germany 

43.35 52.21 B: who have been very vocal about uh that they did not support [sigh] what they are doing [sigh] what uh the u._s. is doing in the war um but i 

52.27 57.74 B: do think there are other uh european countries that do not support us um 

57.89 60.59 B: i think for the sake of diplomacy they're not 

61.22 66.65 B: uh being vocal [sigh] uh nor are they going to strike against the u._s. because we've been 

67.37 69.95 B: very aggressive in those terms 

70.27 71.01 B: um 

71.18 81.04 B: but in terms of uh north korea i know north korea has uh nuclear bombs and i read somewhere that they were going to try to the u._s. was going to have a front 

81.26 92.46 B: um at north korea and they're also it's been said that it's been a bad idea because you can't [lipsmack] unfortunately the u._s. can't be in two places at once proverbially speaking 

92.82 101.09 B: but i think if we give less attention to one or the other country like less attention to the middle east uh some of the some of the 

101.10 105.26 B: extremists who are against the u._s. or some of saddam's former followers 

105.60 107.86 B: uh will probably rise up again 

109.48 117.96 B: and battle the u._s. forces 'cause i do still i still think saddam hussein is still alive and i think he's in hiding he's probably 

118.22 122.97 B: hiding at the same place uh of osama bin laden uh [sigh] 

123.42 135.95 B: but other than that i don't think any other count- countries aside from the i mean a- aside from maybe small european organizations 'cause they've been against it since day one i know great britain was 

135.96 144.29 B: really against it in spite of you know prime minister blair's impassioned pleas for uh for the british to help the us 

144.87 150.55 B: [sigh] so i i do think there is a lot of people a lot of individuals in general 

150.72 153.35 B: who do not support the war um i 

153.55 159.73 B: do not support the war going you know going over there i mean i hope the troops are safe uh 

160.25 164.87 B: you know and i hope they come home soon i hope everything is a swift recovery but 

165.08 169.88 B: in post war iraq you know they don't even have a government now it's pretty much 

170.35 178.93 B: the government is pretty much in ruins i i don't know they're how they will fare well in terms of having a democracy i think it'll take a long time 

179.23 181.11 B: before they get used to it 

181.68 183.27 B: so i think a lot of the 

184.07 193.31 B: uh middle easterners not just the iraqi people i'm sure many of 'em are glad that they're not under saddam's regime but i think many of the middle easterners 

193.96 199.19 B: uh don't support the fact that it is blah sorry it is a democracy 

199.43 202.95 B: 'cause i also have read in the paper uh one 

203.63 208.37 B: uh man a business owner made a comment who lived in egypt he said you know they're 

208.48 211.08 B: many of the arab you know 

212.19 219.18 B: uh political regimes are dictatorial so he said that's really nothing new the fact that you know saddam 

220.10 227.24 B: e- existed in power so long not that he was supporting him but he said you know it's nothing new to to have this dictatorial regime [lipsmack] 

227.17 227.97 A: (( [noise] )) 

227.46 229.06 B: but i really think that 

229.30 232.24 B: the fact that we went in there has 

233.08 241.10 B: of course you know soured relations with many of our countries i mean many many other countries it's gonna be a long time before 

241.31 244.43 B: we repair it if we can even repair it at all 

245.28 246.39 B: 'cause you know 

245.57 251.37 A: well dr seymour i'm carol crawfield and i agree with you on ver- very many things 

251.54 264.66 A: in regard to north korea which is a threat to the u._s. 'cause we've had soldiers in south korea for years ever since the korean war and they've been getting killed over there 

264.51 273.84 A: um couple of years ago that happened and there have been skirmishes uh along the border for years um 

272.99 273.87 B: (( [noise] )) 

274.27 278.15 A: as far as the current agenda with the war in iraq 

278.76 284.10 A: i just think as long as the u._s. uh backs israel and doesn't 

284.20 288.84 A: um help to establish a a state of palestine 

288.90 292.48 A: but all of the middle east has been um 

292.88 294.10 A: um 

294.12 302.49 A: using putting a face on their enemy and and the face is uh the u._s. the sole superpower 

302.72 303.83 A: um 

304.55 306.47 A: as far as 

306.57 312.87 A: whether or not we w- should have gone to war i don't know what i would do 

312.95 317.99 A: if i were the president of the united states after nine eleven 

318.26 321.94 A: i used to work in the u._s. foreign service 

322.17 325.16 A: and was overseas 

325.29 330.72 A: for many years so for the past twenty five years both europe 

331.09 332.51 A: and africa 

332.71 337.72 A: and the middle east have had um u- u- u- unt- 

338.18 344.37 A: unknown to most of the people in the u._s. acts of terrorism and and quite a few 

344.48 350.43 A: um americans were killed some were targeted individually 

350.67 356.05 A: and uh some were at random going all the way back to the achilles lauro 

356.60 361.19 A: what do we do and how do we put a face on terrorism 

361.30 367.71 A: so we say to the terrorists we will retaliate i just don't know 

367.73 368.93 A: um 

368.72 374.76 B: well the terrorists have many faces [laughter] that's one of the problems i know after nine eleven 

375.46 380.45 B: um you know our government has [cough] declared the war on terror 

380.85 385.99 B: which is all very noble and which is all very good and we have to do that to protect our interests but 

386.23 394.03 B: you know there's many forms of terrorism and i mean you know you have the i._r._a. that's you know that terrorizes 

394.38 403.34 B: great britain you have terrorists in the u._s. there's you know you can in- you can insert a- yeah you can insert the name of any hate group [laughter] that's that's 

397.58 400.85 A: well exactly and that's why that's why 

402.54 409.25 A: yeah well that's why tony blair even joined the united states because the i._r._a. has been quiet 

409.30 418.20 A: uh since uh he joined with the u._s. against terrorism and also the irish american community here i know in philadelphia and new york 

409.88 411.09 B: mhm 

418.28 423.78 A: has stopped a- shipping money to the i._r._a. which for years they've done 

423.66 429.98 B: yes i i've heard that i've heard that um there were bars in boston that actually had collection jars 

425.45 427.29 A: yeah 

429.87 443.68 A: right and in new york and in philly uh in the irish american clubs here in philadelphia um that's where i live in philly um so i- i- y- you know the idea is um 

430.56 432.31 B: for the for the i._r._a. 

432.36 433.41 B: mhm 

437.26 438.13 B: right 

445.27 447.92 A: a- a- the thing that that really 

448.21 455.06 A: gets me as far as this goes is i don't think that going to war with iraq changed the 

455.26 457.13 A: middle eastern mind 

456.78 458.05 B: no it didn't 

457.42 459.98 A: vis a vis the united states i don't think 

459.06 463.70 B: yeah i i think it made it worse i think it gave us more of a reason to hate us 

464.36 466.66 B: i think i you know 

466.77 471.81 A: yeah see i i i i really don't i think it was for a minute there i think 

467.84 469.47 B: and i think it's fear 

471.98 479.86 A: a- a- i- in i i mean i well i used to go to the saudi embassy all the time with the youngsters just joining the foreign service and 

479.01 479.98 B: mhm 

479.85 488.85 A: um we backed the saudi and yet and yet they've really used us as a scapegoat i mean uh money has been traced 

485.31 486.83 B: right 

489.05 496.27 A: it certainly to the royal family there was an interesting interview with the head retired head of mosad 

491.21 492.12 B: mhm 

496.21 497.02 B: mhm 

496.58 500.62 A: in which he said that he really felt that the 

500.70 501.85 A: um 

502.48 509.44 A: the middle east would would we would see changes in the middle east by two thousand four two thousand five 

508.92 509.90 B: mhm 

509.50 511.52 A: and that um 

511.58 515.70 A: probably the house of saud would be overturned 

515.36 516.56 B: mhm 

515.93 520.45 A: um and a- a- a- and and 

519.81 521.45 B: mhm 

520.66 523.82 A: we would be be dealing with syria in some 

523.99 530.75 A: in some uh form or another um it was libya who pan who um 

531.05 533.10 A: [lipsmack] uh bombed 

533.31 538.15 A: uh pan am one oh three what was that twelve or thirteen years ago 

537.66 539.01 B: mhm right 

538.37 549.02 A: and um i knew some parents who were very involved in that and moammar gaddafi i was in the country when moammar gaddafi was 

543.88 544.86 B: mhm 

549.33 551.59 A: calling for a united 

552.01 554.21 A: muslim africa 

553.88 554.78 B: mhm 

554.22 559.78 A: and he's been quiet for years but he went to egypt not too long ago maybe about 

558.27 559.27 B: yeah 

559.81 564.23 A: within the past year and his picture was in the paper with mobaric 

563.81 564.98 B: mhm 

564.34 565.53 A: and so 

565.75 574.64 A: we really do have a lot of enemies who would harbor terrorists uh gaddafi being a known one mobaric we give 

570.81 571.74 B: right 

573.30 579.06 B: right well 'cause there is anti american sentiment in egypt right now i i heard a story on n._p._r. 

579.05 590.12 B: there were seven thousand men willing to join [noise] to fight against the u._s. but they [noise] you know technically the on the diplomatic level they can't because egypt is a- allied to the u._s. 

579.06 580.82 A: mhm 

590.01 598.34 A: well i think after israel most of our foreign aid goes to egypt i think it's number two which is amazing 

595.06 596.37 B: mhm 

598.35 599.89 A: um although i 

598.80 599.36 B: (( [noise] ))
