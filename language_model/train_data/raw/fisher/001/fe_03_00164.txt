103.91 104.46 B: oh really 

107.76 109.55 B: uh you know i think maybe um 

110.63 110.91 B: go- 

111.18 112.89 B: the holidays more sort of 

113.28 113.76 B: uh 

115.06 116.37 B: it's got more of a focus 

116.56 117.00 A: mhm 

116.80 119.23 B: so with with big holidays uh 

119.58 120.21 B: like 

120.47 121.70 B: thanksgiving or something 

122.05 122.44 A: mhm 

122.15 122.86 B: i think that 

122.99 123.41 B: there's 

123.65 125.04 B: there's sort of this thing you know 

125.16 126.93 B: i live in a a different state from my 

127.48 127.85 B: (( )) 

128.18 128.65 A: mhm 

128.36 128.85 B: um 

129.49 130.29 B: and 

130.53 131.06 B: uh 

131.33 131.75 B: my 

131.97 138.31 B: girlfriend's family lives in another state so there's always a sort of a debate you know where are we going to go what are we going to do 

138.49 139.04 A: mhm 

138.59 139.75 B: um and then we go 

139.84 142.07 B: and then there's this travel component that 

141.98 142.49 A: mhm 

142.52 142.92 B: makes it 

143.35 145.25 B: sort of maybe a little bit more stressful 

145.55 146.32 A: mmm 

146.30 147.94 B: but with birthdays it's sort of 

148.23 150.40 B: straightforward you just have a good time 

150.56 151.15 A: mhm 

150.98 151.26 B: and 

151.89 154.32 B: give or get presents you get together with your friends 

154.47 155.26 A: mhm 

154.91 156.87 B: there's never this sort of pressure of 

157.29 157.65 B: um 

157.87 159.77 B: i have to see my family or 

159.66 160.42 A: right 

161.16 161.53 B: um 

162.53 165.20 B: uh it's just should've laid back a good time 

165.04 171.14 A: wow i like how you put that i think when i was younger yes i used to deal with the stress and 

171.23 173.39 A: i didn- i really didn't enjoy 

176.61 176.86 B: yeah 

180.19 180.48 B: mmm 

181.51 182.44 A: in america 

190.18 199.04 A: where we're going to go for memorial day who's going to barbecue you know and who's going to bring the apron you know i 

191.82 192.72 B: yeah 

195.53 195.88 B: yeah 

208.98 209.33 B: yeah 

216.05 222.38 A: even bring home a christmas tree i don't want it you know all this stuff that goes into it 

218.46 218.74 B: yeah 

222.17 222.46 B: yeah 

222.53 223.06 A: but 

223.37 228.42 A: once i realized that i can make those holidays wherever i wished to 

228.47 228.87 B: mhm 

228.93 232.57 A: then i got smart and got rid of the (( )) 

229.95 230.22 B: yeah 

233.00 233.31 B: yeah 

233.70 241.61 A: so um i think that's the key is um not buying into the um commercial 

242.88 251.42 A: uh atmosphere of um the holidays and not buying into the stress that family members could create 

244.38 244.76 B: yeah 

246.11 246.59 B: it's true 

251.54 252.47 A: without 

252.61 254.42 A: meaning to um 

254.01 254.42 B: yeah 

254.74 255.85 B: it's always i mean 

254.85 255.27 A: and 

255.95 256.79 B: they never mean to 

256.00 256.30 A: mhm 

263.41 263.84 A: (( )) 

268.48 268.79 B: yeah 

269.24 271.05 A: do you have plans for this holiday 

271.56 272.02 B: um 

272.66 274.11 B: yeah well so 

274.20 275.00 B: um actually 

275.22 277.23 B: my family's jewish so we don't celebrate christmas 

276.27 280.58 A: i figured that but that's okay 

278.40 278.96 B: um 

279.52 282.86 B: uh but my father's birthday happens to be very close to christmas 

282.81 283.29 A: uh-huh 

283.68 284.67 B: and 

284.83 287.38 B: so i i usually try to make it because 

287.75 288.21 B: um 

288.36 289.91 B: you know i have time off from school 

290.32 291.37 B: uh so i 

291.63 292.02 B: uh 

292.16 292.89 B: i feel like 

293.09 296.16 B: i have time off so i i ca- i should be able to make the trip so i usually try 

296.49 296.98 A: mhm 

296.76 299.56 B: to uh visit them around the time of his birthday 

299.78 300.28 A: mmm 

300.30 300.75 B: um 

300.96 302.11 B: and that's what we're going to be doing 

302.36 302.93 B: this year 

303.17 310.55 A: well how do you feel uh that school lets out for a christian holiday and not for hanukkah 

311.01 311.44 B: um 

312.62 314.76 B: i think i'm just kind of used to it now 

314.93 315.43 A: mhm 

315.33 315.77 B: um 

316.90 318.98 B: it's sometimes a little bit frustrating that 

319.33 319.82 A: mhm 

319.76 320.48 B: especially when 

320.71 322.76 B: when hanukkah's a lot earlier than christmas 

322.78 324.54 A: mhm right mhm 

323.77 327.06 B: that people sort of just skip over it and you know the 

327.27 328.87 B: the sequence of holidays is 

329.04 330.67 B: thanksgiving and then christmas 

330.32 330.89 A: right 

330.94 331.38 B: um 

331.68 333.60 B: and this year hanukkah was right in the middle 

333.81 334.59 B: so there was uh 

334.00 335.06 A: of yeah 

334.72 336.45 B: a real opportunity to be like 

336.71 341.57 B: thanksgiving uh hanukkah and christmas but um that's kind of not the way people think about it but 

341.69 342.13 B: uh 

342.38 342.82 B: you know 

344.14 345.15 B: i'm sort of used to it 

345.64 346.18 A: mhm 

345.74 346.28 B: um 

346.82 348.33 B: and hanukkah's not really 

348.73 349.91 B: a really huge holiday 

349.99 350.66 A: okay 

350.80 351.27 B: um 

351.49 352.56 B: in terms of it's 

353.23 354.39 B: cultural significance 

354.52 354.98 A: mhm 

355.13 356.51 B: so it's not a big deal i mean 

356.23 357.84 A: i uh what 

357.96 358.90 A: mmm 

359.29 360.90 A: mmm uh 

366.37 366.64 B: yeah 

369.48 372.36 A: they practice the jewish faith you know but 

371.62 371.92 B: uh-huh 

372.47 377.95 A: there christians um and i think it's it's based on the bible they 

389.22 389.71 B: (( )) 

389.57 394.22 A: the reason why they practice the jewish holidays rather than the christian holidays 

395.26 395.67 B: uh-huh 

402.77 403.10 B: uh-huh 

403.57 403.93 B: yeah 

416.41 416.74 B: uh-huh 

421.18 421.65 B: it's interesting 

422.39 423.02 A: i 

430.97 432.84 A: can't remember off hand what's 

432.95 443.33 A: call and i said i'm going to go and look for that book or or audio tape or whatever i heard it on one of the the radio stations do you know of the story that i'm 

436.90 437.16 B: huh 

441.17 441.42 B: huh 

443.48 447.49 A: mmm thinking of have you heard of the nutcracker being converted 

447.18 449.64 B: oh no i haven't i didn't know about that it's interesting 

460.18 466.07 A: um lesson to learn you know in the end and uh 

462.77 463.12 B: yeah 

466.34 469.29 A: and and it was a good one i wish i could remember 

469.53 470.47 A: of the name of it 

473.85 474.10 B: yeah 

481.35 482.63 A: well what would it be 

483.75 484.11 B: mmm 

484.32 487.03 B: it's it's an in- you know what i never really thought about that 

509.54 511.00 A: the jewish holiday 

511.36 512.00 B: um 

512.36 515.58 B: you it's an interesting idea uh i'm not sure that 

516.12 516.61 B: um 

517.95 519.60 B: i like the idea of 

520.27 520.65 B: of 

521.19 522.88 B: religious holidays or 

523.16 524.27 B: well not so much that it 

524.23 524.63 A: mhm 

524.36 524.86 B: it's more 

524.96 526.52 B: i'm not sure i like it when 

526.78 528.32 B: there's a holiday on the calendar 

528.55 530.55 B: that only applies to 

530.57 531.63 A: a certain group 

531.01 531.35 B: uh 

531.60 532.24 B: yeah 

532.42 533.23 A: mhm 

532.56 532.93 B: um 

533.44 533.88 B: and that 

534.44 534.90 B: i think that 

535.40 537.06 B: it kind of takes away from it because 

538.28 539.31 B: the holiday sort of has this 

539.44 541.42 B: asterisk next to it that that says 

541.79 545.92 B: oh you know it's just for jewish people or it's just for christian people or whatever 

545.10 546.02 A: oh yeah 

546.12 547.03 A: yeah 

546.42 546.78 B: um 

547.19 549.83 B: so i think i like it more when it's for everybody 

547.23 548.34 A: are 

549.85 551.39 A: you have a great point 

551.50 557.05 A: but um i think differences should be celebrated too and 

555.98 556.79 B: it's true yeah 

557.52 565.84 A: if it's not on the calendar or putting it on the calendar in my opinion it seems as if it would give uh the 

566.31 567.14 A: culture that 

567.24 569.31 A: celebrates that uh
