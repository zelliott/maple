6.14 7.62 A: ah my name's lauren

8.80 13.22 B: my name's joan and i live i live in tennessee where do you live 

10.31 11.31 A: (( hi joan )) 

12.91 14.63 A: ah i live in philadelphia 

14.46 20.60 B: in ph- oh in philadelphia all right well we're supposed to discuss what if anything 

21.48 24.70 B: the united states should do about iraq 

24.73 27.21 A: [laughter] yeah i think that's our topic 

26.63 30.32 B: that is a that's a mouthful of a topic and ah 

29.55 31.64 A: it's a big one [laughter] 

30.57 33.49 B: yes indeed and um [lipsmack] 

33.63 41.98 B: ah what can we do about iraq um i've been watching it on the news and ah watching the ah arms inspections 

38.23 39.20 A: mhm 

41.80 42.91 A: mhm 

42.11 43.39 B: (( and ah )) 

43.71 45.37 B: then ah d- ah 

45.69 54.54 B: seeing the reaction on ah our side where they say we're just waiting for them to ah hide things and make mistakes and ah 

54.69 65.52 A: well i i think part of my concern with the whole thing really is i mean i'm glad that it it does seem as though the rest of the world is at least slightly backing us i don't think that it's a hundred percent 

65.37 66.10 B: no 

66.00 74.88 A: and i think to a certain degree bush just wants a war like it's almost as though he wants to finish his father's unfinished business 

75.85 76.98 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

75.95 82.77 B: yes yes is this what everybody in philadelphia thinks because that's exactly what my quaker friend in philadelphia thinks 

82.49 84.78 A: really oh that's so funny 

83.16 83.90 B: yes 

84.13 93.33 B: yes i was just talking with her today and ah that she's often said that this is simply a do you listen to ah radio talk shows in philadelphia 

93.20 95.71 A: no i don't i actually i'm a student at penn 

95.71 106.25 B: okay and s- and this is just a a maybe this is ah j- ah just a common response thinking that he merely wants to finish what his father started um 

105.26 110.30 A: [noise] [mn] well yeah i mean i don't know ah h- what's the attitude down there in tennessee 

110.39 111.34 B: (( ah )) 

111.48 113.02 B: actually 

113.63 128.63 B: a lot of my friends do not discuss this i mean i don't discuss this with my friends so i kind of inform my own opinion by watching the news and my husband and i talk about it um but as this is not a general topic of conversation 

124.27 125.55 A: mhm 

128.41 134.29 B: among me and my friends because ah ah most a lot of what i do is in spanish and 

128.61 129.51 A: (( [mn] )) 

130.49 131.39 A: oh 

134.61 137.32 B: ah that's not top priority for them 

135.19 136.60 A: (( really )) 

137.37 139.14 A: (( [mn] oh )) 

141.95 144.62 B: (( [laughter] )) 

142.65 144.46 A: (( [noise] oh oh )) 

146.73 147.96 B: (( [laughter] )) 

147.38 151.27 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] how long have you taught )) 

150.01 152.57 B: oh how wonderful 

152.33 153.39 A: yeah i 

152.98 156.68 B: so i i actually think that [mn] 

157.32 161.49 B: it's a burden for us to feel 

161.73 163.16 B: that 

163.82 178.61 B: we need to regulate the world at the same time [lipsmack] who else is going to do it and this man has used his weapons of ah biochemical weapons against his own people and against other people 

166.20 167.25 A: mhm 

176.99 178.01 A: mhm 

178.61 181.16 B: [mn] um the government has ah 

181.38 186.13 B: agreed that the gulf war participants were gassed 

185.57 186.68 A: mhm 

186.17 199.05 B: um they probably didn't want to agree that that had happened ah because now they have to pay for care but ah they have agreed and s- when they examined the soldiers that they 

193.41 194.44 A: right 

198.93 199.98 A: mhm 

199.29 205.73 B: do see results that are very similar to the sa- ah sar- sarin remember the 

204.23 206.43 A: um yeah sarin 

206.14 211.77 B: sarin um [mn] ah ah gas used in japan 

207.09 208.09 A: mhm 

209.36 210.57 A: from japan 

211.46 212.58 A: mhm 

212.13 219.21 B: so yes he's done it and yes he's got 'em and if he's used 'em once he surely will use them again they say he cannot 

219.36 227.86 B: ah the only reason he didn't use more of them in the gulf war is that he couldn't buy the antidote he was short on antidote which is what's it called atrop- 

228.03 229.16 B: at- atropine 

229.17 230.48 A: yeah atropine 

230.31 232.76 B: okay [mn] so 

231.18 232.15 A: mhm 

232.79 233.82 B: um 

234.10 236.24 B: [lipsmack] i since he has 

236.35 245.51 B: got them and going to use them um [lipsmack] ah if he feels like he it like it would benefit him [lipsmack] ah 

246.28 249.44 B: this changes what 

250.55 254.91 B: relations between countries are and maybe should be 

254.81 255.42 A: (( [noise] )) 

255.11 258.99 B: um do we have the right to do this is it morally correct 

259.07 260.59 B: [mn] i'm not sure 

259.46 260.31 A: well 

261.34 264.36 A: [mn] the concern that i have is that what we seem to done 

264.37 266.60 A: ah to have done at least in the media 

266.69 268.76 A: and partially in um 

269.11 282.60 A: you know from what i h- have heard in you know the few speeches that he's given and you know ashcroft has given um [mn] they they s- they're trying to associate what happened with september eleventh with iraq 

282.75 284.51 A: and you know 

283.48 286.05 B: they're probably two different issues 

285.45 295.25 A: they are completely two different issues but they're trying to tie them together in order to sway the public opinion of the country and i find that to be kind of insulting 

295.45 301.95 A: [mn] because you know i mean we've all heard who the majority of those ah terrorists were they wer- a lot of them were saudis 

300.81 303.08 B: (( yes they were saudis they were saudis yeah )) 

302.07 303.08 A: yeah 

303.23 308.33 A: you know an- but [noise] we are fighting the wrong country you know because 

303.40 305.66 B: so may- maybe we're fighting the wrong country 

306.58 310.42 B: [laughter] but but saudi arabia has more oil [laughter] 

309.64 315.58 A: exactly saudi arabia we are economically dependent on because of the oil and the reality is [lipsmack] 

315.77 320.95 A: that we can't fight them and we know it because we're just too dependent on them 

321.06 329.39 A: so we can't go into saudi arabia and blow them away but we can pick a country like kuwa- um iraq where we have past aggressions with them 

329.42 336.83 A: the leadership is faulty at best and you know a- we can come out looking like well at least in 

335.71 344.86 B: mhm with with with looking like what yeah that's [laughter] there isn't any real there isn't any real end to that sentence 'cause we'll come out looking like [laughter] mud on our face no matter what 

339.14 340.40 A: i think 

344.64 349.52 A: exactly and i think the rest of the world is sick of us i've traveled a lot i've lived 

348.88 361.51 B: but it's easy to be sick of us they're not doing it themselves and really if if this fellow does complete ah successfully a ah ah ah gassing or or 

361.49 365.39 B: or diseasing or [laughter] whatever he's planning on doing 

365.59 367.99 B: they know they're next 

367.57 368.13 A: (( mm )) 

368.70 369.87 A: (( i don't )) 

369.54 370.20 B: (( right )) 

370.09 376.79 A: know if it was really all that large of a threat i mean i it it kind of came out of nowhere 

376.90 378.96 A: he hadn't threatened us he hadn't 

379.15 381.81 A: he hadn't even been in the news for years 

382.19 386.06 A: and you know when you really think about what happened with the gulf war [mn] 

386.36 389.46 A: we went in there and devastated that country and left 

389.51 390.76 A: it wasn't like 

389.53 398.09 B: y- yet had we had we stayed and helped the kurds he would not have done that to them but they were down and he could do it 

397.77 400.10 A: exactly we never finished 

398.35 399.48 B: so he did 

400.66 405.72 A: i've had um a friend of mine was actually in the only tank that was actually hit by enemy fire 

405.41 406.77 B: mhm oh really 

406.44 407.80 A: mhm 

406.97 409.08 B: and died or was injured mhm 

408.26 413.56 A: [mn] no he was he was badly injured but no he's totally alive [mn] 

413.26 414.47 B: mhm mhm 

413.89 414.94 A: and um 

414.97 426.04 A: you know in his point of view is in from a lot of people that i've spoken to that were in it they just feel as though they went in and they didn't really finish anything and it's almost the same attitude like 

424.91 428.33 B: well we n- we never do it's we aren't doing in afghanistan either 

428.23 430.52 A: right and it's just like vietnam 

429.88 435.51 B: it yeah it's at at some point i think we back out saying ah 

435.66 438.40 B: we really shouldn't be doing this [laughter] 

437.84 448.93 A: either that or it's like okay you know we've proven that we can k- we can we can kick your butt and you know now we don't have to prove any more and the reality is it's i mean if world war two should have taught us something 

448.84 454.85 A: you know and we things were done right on a certain level you know we went in and we won but we rebuilt those countries 

454.91 462.26 A: and now those countries are you know they no- not complete democracies but they're definitely a lot closer than the dictatorships that they were 

462.49 468.94 A: you know and they are economically our allies look at japan and germany i mean we're tied with germany completely 

469.17 476.02 A: you know [noise] and it worked out to our benefit on both levels whereas you know from the korean war on all we've done is go in 

476.51 480.95 A: fight for a while and leave and it there's no victor 

478.58 480.20 B: yeah mhm mhm 

481.34 484.40 A: you know there's nothing it's just pointless war 

485.07 485.76 A: (( i- )) 

485.29 490.59 B: [mn] that and the other point th- another part of it though [mn] is 

490.83 497.77 B: if there was greater world support for this it might be easier to browbeat them 

494.00 495.04 A: mhm 

497.91 498.83 B: (( into )) 

499.46 506.19 B: if they're supposed to burn their weapons of mass destruction to browbeat them into doing it or whatever they're supposed to do with 'em 

505.88 506.95 A: right 

506.47 508.56 B: um because 

509.71 513.93 B: ah surely they are not it's it's not a stable situation 

513.88 514.62 A: (( uh-uh )) 

514.50 516.06 B: (( [lipsmack] and ah )) 

517.60 520.92 B: [mn] i'm a little worried about what they might do toward israel 

521.34 525.17 A: [mn] yeah i think well i think that's going to be that's an issue in general just 

525.23 526.28 A: i mean with 

526.37 530.71 A: between the hatred of the israelis and the hatred towards the united states 

530.85 533.11 A: i- i would not want to be in israel right now 

533.57 534.60 A: (( [mn] because )) 

534.19 540.89 B: no [laughter] i i wouldn't want to be anywhere right now except here i've stopped traveling i used to travel a lot yup 

534.99 536.37 A: [laughter] 

540.37 542.98 A: oh really oh no i'm still traveling 

542.80 544.05 B: (( oh you are mm )) 

543.62 544.37 A: mhm 

544.10 545.44 B: (( oh )) 

545.29 555.33 A: [mn] definitely um i would i would get my italian passport i wouldn't give up obviously would never give up my american passport but [mn] i would get my my grandfather was italian 

555.38 556.85 B: can you have dual 

555.52 556.22 A: (( and i )) 

556.77 560.02 A: uh-huh you can have a dual dual passport i 

559.28 563.14 B: okay do you have to start it when you're like thirteen or something or 

563.07 564.57 A: don't think so uh-uh 

563.90 566.03 B: you you can get it any time 

565.75 573.43 A: i'm pretty sure yeah they change the rules every once in a while but i'm pretty sure that it's [noise] it's fairly flexible as long as you know obviously as long as you're not 

567.03 567.95 B: okay 

571.65 579.69 B: okay th- for some for some that have dual [mn] there's a window where you can get it and then if you don't get it in that window of time you can't get your 

576.63 577.45 A: [noise] 

579.48 580.93 A: [noise] oh really 

580.14 584.37 B: point point of origin passport so if you want to get it you might look into it and see if 

584.42 586.61 A: probably depends on what country it is 

586.74 592.06 B: absolutely absolutely because it it depends on how they've decided to handle it 

586.84 588.17 A: to a certain extent 

588.81 590.24 A: [noise] 

591.76 596.34 A: exactly i'm pretty sure italy's not much of a threat [laughter] they can't even get their own stuff together 

596.26 607.90 B: oh well no but there's the the country that i'm referring to is ireland and there is a window and ireland ireland is not a threat so it doesn't have to do with whether they're a threat it has to do with reciprocal agreements 

601.97 603.14 A: oh yeah 

608.04 614.56 A: [noise] oh [noise] oh we'll that would make sense yeah huh yeah i should look into it no i haven't actu-
