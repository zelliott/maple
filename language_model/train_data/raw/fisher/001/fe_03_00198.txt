7.85 9.23 A: um [laughter] 

9.55 21.43 A: i don't know seeing as how christmas is coming up i'm pretty excited about that to be honest i'm a college student so i'm really looking forward to going home and spending time with my family 

20.75 32.57 B: mhm yeah i agree with you i think i have a daughter that's a college student so i i i can see i can relate with you very well [laughter] and as far as 

25.70 26.91 A: (( ah )) 

28.35 29.64 A: [laughter] 

32.44 35.81 B: making a holiday that's a tough one 

35.36 49.65 A: i think that is difficult i was [laughter] i don't know i mean there's so many insignificant holidays you know [laughter] like remote holidays that i guess people don't even celebrate so it would be difficult to come up with something original that's worth celebrating 

40.93 43.05 B: mhm right 

49.01 51.35 B: i know there's there's 

49.93 51.02 A: [laughter] 

51.87 57.88 B: [sigh] so many charitable things that we could make but i don't know if everybody would cooperate with it 

57.43 60.15 A: that's probably true also 

59.89 60.79 B: (( hm )) 

60.91 64.66 B: [mn] well [laughter] 

62.23 64.98 A: (( uh-huh [laughter] well i don't )) 

65.44 66.45 B: [sigh] 

65.96 76.31 A: i was reading this thing once and it like um apparently there's some day in july that's like national ice cream hol- th- like the national ice cream holiday or something 

76.54 81.83 A: and and and no one even knows about things like that i don't it's it's really 

79.33 81.42 B: (( mhm right )) 

81.90 83.13 B: [laughter] 

82.33 89.72 A: [laughter] i i'd never heard of it until i was reading i don't know what it was some magazine or book of tidbits or something like that 

89.82 90.80 A: so 

91.22 100.73 B: well you know i think like some of the more elite um card shops don't they have like a calendar or something that says 

97.06 97.91 A: mhm 

100.24 101.33 A: yeah 

100.76 104.76 B: whatever particular holiday there is that they know of 

104.18 105.40 A: mhm 

104.82 107.55 B: that would be interesting just to read that 

106.81 108.74 A: it probably would be i mean 

107.75 109.05 B: [laughter] 

108.78 118.42 A: you know you could use the most ridiculous excuses well it's a holiday today [laughter] because it you would come up with all of these crazy things 

113.21 114.71 B: [laughter] 

117.84 120.04 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

118.98 123.62 A: so i i don't but to create a holiday um 

123.64 126.09 B: you'd really have to put on your thinking cap 

125.60 127.53 A: that's probably true 

127.54 128.58 A: (( i don't )) 

127.65 134.93 B: i mean they have grandparent's day which is nice but i don't think a whole lot of people participate in that 

129.88 131.96 A: they do have grandparent's day 

133.58 135.59 A: participate in that no 

135.65 139.50 B: i know like i have a granddaughter that lives in overland park kansas 

137.56 138.33 A: mhm 

139.08 140.04 A: mhm 

139.59 147.41 B: and they have one day at school where they invite the grandparents to come to have lunch with them and and spend half the day with them 

146.99 147.83 A: mhm 

147.43 148.55 B: but now 

148.57 151.55 B: at my local where i live 

151.56 158.57 B: they don't have that at our school which is disappointing to me because i could make that one [laughter] 

155.62 156.67 A: yeah 

157.27 162.46 A: yeah that's too bad but that's neat that they do that i've never heard of that before 

160.70 161.66 B: mhm 

161.84 163.36 B: oh you haven't 

162.63 166.16 A: no i mean i've heard of grandparent's day but i've never heard of them inviting 

166.34 169.25 A: like grandparents to come yes 

166.49 168.59 B: oh in school you mean 

168.68 170.26 B: oh where are you from 

170.06 171.83 A: i'm from dallas 

171.27 173.73 B: oh okay okay 

172.08 174.34 A: so yeah 

173.80 174.81 B: oh 

175.00 177.84 B: well it's it's really popular 

177.97 188.79 B: in the kansas area i know that and i think some of the public schools in missouri do it too but not the catholic schools as much 

179.42 180.18 A: (( i i see )) 

185.67 186.77 A: mhm 

188.32 197.58 A: yeah that's that's where my grandparent well one set of grandparents live but of course i've never lived there so it's it doesn't do me a whole lot of good 

194.12 196.07 B: (( mhm oh yeah )) 

196.44 201.12 B: isn't that isn't that funny how different areas of the state have different ways 

199.41 206.37 A: different things yeah yeah 'cause i'm i'm going to school actually in the deep south which is a lot different 

206.10 207.91 B: oh 

206.93 215.89 A: than [laughter] than you know when you live in dallas it's i mean i guess they say that you know texas is southern i think that we should have a texas day there you go 

209.82 210.70 B: mhm 

215.14 217.18 B: oh yeah you go 

216.63 224.89 A: i've noticed something about that my school has a lot of n- like native texans even though it's not in texas and um 

223.55 224.62 B: uh-huh 

225.29 226.74 A: i've noticed that 

226.91 230.94 A: texans have an amazing amount of state pride i mean 

231.44 239.38 A: and i didn't even realize it because i've always lived in texas until until i came to school and i didn't even realize how 

240.17 241.64 A: [sigh] just 

241.83 245.38 A: how much it it meant to me to be a texan 

245.39 246.50 B: oh 

245.42 250.19 A: you know because when you think about or even just just like a state pride holiday of some sort 

249.57 257.76 B: mhm yeah there you go let's have once a month have a different state celebrate their state i mean you know 

250.48 251.39 A: because 

256.61 257.60 A: yeah 

257.78 263.88 A: because i mean i think there's a lot of interesting things about all the different states in the union that probably you don't know about i mean 

261.52 262.64 B: (( mhm )) 

263.27 265.07 B: right 

264.17 277.22 A: and texans probably have a lot of things to be proud of i mean i know like we do i mean we have you know little cliches of cowboys and oil millionaires that we're proud of but just you know the vastness and everything i mean 

271.88 273.11 B: (( mhm )) 

273.53 275.09 B: right right 

276.89 277.96 B: mhm 

277.33 280.81 A: and i think every state does like you were talking about have a lot of 

280.84 284.08 A: individual character so you know i mean 

282.20 288.48 B: mhm yeah there you go i think we should [laughter] get something going here 

285.90 287.13 A: [laughter] 

287.77 291.33 A: [laughter] we're gonna start writing our congressmen 

290.92 299.93 B: [laughter] the only problem is there's only twelve months in a year so we'd have to double it up somehow or whatever [laughter] 

294.72 297.15 A: unfortunately that's that's true 

297.85 308.58 A: yeah it would have to be it would have to be every i don't know four years or something along those lines i guess that would cover forty eight states we'll just leave out hawaii and alaska because they're not they're not 

302.05 303.62 B: [laughter] 

305.98 307.07 B: [laughter] 

308.52 313.31 B: well i don't think they'd they'd be happy about that though [laughter] 

309.15 310.67 A: continental u._s. 

310.84 312.23 A: [laughter] 

313.02 315.19 A: (( maybe they can have leap year or something )) 

314.49 317.29 B: well there you go yeah 

315.34 318.42 A: we'll just we'll just slip you in february [laughter] 

317.44 318.80 B: [laughter] 

319.55 322.74 B: oh gosh well it cer- it reminds me a little bit of a 

322.81 324.24 B: christmas tree 

324.22 325.08 A: mhm 

324.37 326.99 B: that has lots of ornaments 

326.62 327.62 A: mhm 

327.01 332.41 B: and every year the ornaments you they accumulate you know because of memories or whatever 

330.32 331.24 A: yes 

331.90 333.88 A: mhm yeah 

333.28 346.92 B: so um a little story relating to that is this year uh i got a very small artificial tree to just put on a table because i'm getting too old to lug the big old thing up and down the stairs 

341.06 342.14 A: mhm 

344.12 345.21 A: [laughter] 

347.08 360.33 B: and i was talking to my daughter about that and i said oh i said i don't know if i should be doing this 'cause i've got all these wonderful memories in my ornaments and she said well mom she said there's a good way of doing that she said just 

354.02 355.06 A: yeah 

355.78 356.74 A: mhm 

360.89 370.72 B: rotate every year just put different ones on and that way you'll be remembering certain ones one year and certain ones the next year 

364.80 365.51 A: (( mm )) 

369.65 371.08 A: yeah 

371.09 374.58 A: (( oh that's neat to bring out different )) 

374.07 375.31 B: yeah 

374.72 376.36 A: i know for um 

376.86 379.17 A: for thanksgiving i guess 

379.56 383.16 A: for thanksgiving we have the thanksgiving tablecloth at my house 

382.77 383.89 B: oh 

383.28 386.57 A: and we have to write something that we're thankful for every year 

386.25 387.31 B: uh-huh 

386.80 395.84 A: and so that becomes cumulative as we see you know over the years like what what it is that matters to different members of the family and it's also just something to remember who 

389.70 391.47 B: (( oh yeah )) 

392.65 393.64 B: uh-huh 

395.83 405.26 A: you know i mean it's just my mom just has like fabric markers and you know i mean a cheap tablecloth it's nothing special but just to see who was there and you know kind of what 

399.26 400.39 B: mhm 

405.08 414.41 A: like for instance wh- when we looked back at what happened last year and you know a a lot of like there was a lot of patriotism in what people said because of you know september eleventh and all 

413.69 415.94 B: right right 

414.32 423.51 A: that so you know i mean i think i think holidays are because they're kind of a way to step back from reality they're also kind of like reflective of what's going on so 

423.12 433.21 B: well you know that's interesting that you do that because that's kind of like a little diary i mean you know a memory book or whatever when you do that that's really neat 

428.14 429.23 A: mhm 

430.72 431.72 A: yeah 

432.56 439.02 A: it is i mean i don't know my mom's really great that way of always making the holidays special and and things like that so 

435.34 436.94 B: well good 

438.49 439.65 B: oh 

439.88 446.61 B: well is that kind of a tradition in your family i mean did she do that when she was growing up too 

443.55 445.04 A: (( y- yeah )) 

445.78 449.83 A: well it it's something that she started in our family i mean 

450.17 456.27 A: so it's not it's not terribly old but i mean because i guess i can remember when she started it but it seems like a 

452.33 453.29 B: uh-huh 

456.15 469.03 A: a bit back that that that happened so i mean it was it was enough to create you know some kind of interesting contrast [laughter] of as as we looked back on it just thinking huh that's that's interesting that we would say that so 

463.30 464.65 B: mhm 

468.59 472.54 B: well and then this is something that you could pass on to your family whenever 

471.46 478.68 A: exactly i'm sure that eventually it'll [laughter] it'll get too full but not yet so 

472.68 474.33 B: that was neat 

477.15 478.32 B: (( well )) 

478.65 487.72 A: i also i was reading something the other day it was much along the same lines but it was like it was a scrapbook of christmas lists you know what you want for christmas 

487.33 488.59 B: (( mhm )) 

487.82 502.56 A: and i think that that's probably similar you know because it's when you're young especially that's such a big deal the things that you want i mean 'cause you can remember i can even remember things when i was young that i just had to have for christmas that i just had to have 

493.53 494.81 B: oh yes 

500.64 501.28 B: (( mm )) 

501.83 504.86 B: right right [laughter] 

502.64 507.58 A: and everyone has them and i i'm sure looking back on it i'm sure my parents went through 

507.56 515.37 A: incredible feats to get these gifts because they were probably the toys that everyone wanted and that you couldn't find anywhere and 

510.67 511.82 B: (( correct )) 

512.86 514.32 B: (( mhm )) 

514.60 516.09 B: right 

515.34 529.29 A: you know they were the always the things that you had discarded by the end of january [laughter] because they were usually not very high quality and full of like gimmicky things but the commercials must have been really good because everyone wanted them that year so mhm 

516.31 517.37 B: [laughter] 

519.21 520.67 B: [laughter] 

526.87 528.11 B: [laughter] 

528.68 537.62 B: well then it also stems usually to the fact i've noticed with my grandchildren you can give them the most expensive gift and they really wanted it 

537.71 541.38 B: but thirty minutes later they'll be playing with the boxes 

540.77 542.34 A: yes yes 

541.43 542.54 B: you know 

542.27 542.97 A: my 

542.80 545.94 A: i'm the oldest of of of five children 

545.71 546.71 B: uh-huh 

545.71 559.07 A: and so uh i know even now my parents say you know why don't we just wrap up empty boxes [laughter] and put them under the tree because they wouldn't know the difference they just on christmas morning you can't even see the living room floor 

552.56 554.66 B: [laughter] 

558.41 560.67 B: mhm 

558.88 564.40 A: you know because there's wrapping paper and you know opened boxes everywhere and everything but 

564.09 568.83 B: and speaking of christmas have you ever done the chinese christmas presents 

569.45 572.15 A: oh those chinese christmas present exchanges 

571.76 572.87 B: yes 

572.52 577.67 A: my mother throws one of those parties every year for her girlfriends and she 

575.19 576.87 B: does she really 

577.79 591.03 A: has so much fun i think that i i don't know if she's going to do it this year because she's been having some back problems and she's but that's her friends are going to be so upset i haven't not being at home i don't know all of what goes on 

584.32 585.40 B: oh 

590.29 592.70 B: (( mhm )) 

590.99 600.48 A: [laughter] any more but i know that in years past i mean you know she she would say things like oh i'm not really sure if i feel up to doing it and all of her friends would call and say please please 

597.62 598.85 B: mhm 

599.68 600.91 B: yes 

600.98 601.88 B: whoops 

602.16 602.96 A: (( [noise] )) 

602.26 603.91 B: i guess that's it huh 

603.57 606.08 A: i don't i think that may just be my phone 

605.97 606.81 B: oh 

606.40 608.90 A: i i i think someone will come and 

608.98 610.31 A: (( tell us [laughter] )) 

609.70 612.06 B: i didn't even look at the time when we 

611.29 614.30 A: [noise] hold on just a second i think my phone has a timer 

615.80 621.37 A: i don't it doesn't look like it's done yet but but it's it's about i don't know 

618.55 620.28 B: okay maybe that was 

620.93 623.82 B: well now for this chinese thing 

623.42 624.51 A: mhm 

623.95 626.69 B: did you have a price limit as to what the guests 

625.59 629.32 A: (( yeah i think they thought like a twenty five dollar price limit )) 

628.38 630.29 B: oh it was that much 

629.83 636.40 A: but but they these women get vicious about the gifts that they want 

634.22 635.54 B: [laughter] 

636.28 637.58 B: (( [laughter] )) 

636.44 644.91 A: and and i mean you know th- 'cause they go out to dinner beforehand and so it's quite friendly and really casual and the moment 

640.91 643.05 B: (( mhm )) 

645.20 646.16 B: [laughter] 

645.94 647.46 A: that you know 

648.17 650.94 A: anything like that it it becomes 

648.19 649.08 B: (( gets )) 

651.07 662.76 A: it's funny because you know they they walk in leaving like they walk in laughing and and then the gift exchange starts up and and they're you know giving each other these dirty looks and everything and then it ends and they're friends again 

652.13 653.31 B: [laughter] 

662.26 664.16 B: [laughter] 

662.79 668.00 A: but but during that time where they're doing the gift exchange it's it's heated [laughter] and 

667.25 668.75 B: [laughter] 

668.17 675.56 A: my mom my mom always gets mad because she always gets to she always gets bad numbers i guess it works through like drawing numbers i don't know exactly how it works 

674.81 682.43 B: well i've never actually been part of it either uh my sister in law is gonna be hosting one this this coming weekend 

677.63 678.46 A: mhm 

681.79 684.02 A: oh well prepare yourself [laughter] 

683.28 697.49 B: well i mean i'm not gonna go it's it's for uh some of her special friends but she was telling me about it and she said what they decided to do was set the limit at five dollars like you know that's hard to find something 

684.73 687.14 A: oh oh 

687.48 688.56 A: mhm 

694.55 695.89 A: oh wow 

697.38 698.32 A: mhm 

697.63 699.76 B: decent for five dollars 

699.17 700.30 A: mhm 

699.88 702.33 B: and one of the things they're going to do 

702.51 706.72 B: and it concerns like you said that you want a certain 

706.95 707.96 B: gift
