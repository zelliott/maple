1.18 2.80 B: hi my name's mike 

2.29 4.33 A: hi mike my name's craig 

4.17 5.43 B: hi craig how're you 

5.20 6.43 A: good thanks 

6.75 8.93 B: so are you a hawk or a dove 

8.49 9.76 A: what's that [mn] 

9.28 13.02 B: s- i wanted to cut right to the chase so i said are you a hawk or a dove 

10.65 11.58 A: (( [laughter] )) 

11.59 13.29 A: a hawk or a dove 

13.36 19.21 A: ah i would have to label myself a dove given those two choices i guess 

18.87 20.37 B: (( yeah those are ah [noise] )) 

21.62 28.10 B: those are pretty weak ah they don't really fit a lot of people these days i think it's not a black and white world much anymore 

25.15 26.88 A: (( yeah that's true )) 

27.73 31.26 A: and it's definitely not a black and white problem over there either 

30.82 31.77 B: no 

31.72 32.79 A: (( uh-uh )) 

32.68 42.74 B: i th- i like i like the fact that if any any country in the world is actually e- enough of a threat to justify a preemptive strike it's clearly america 

42.31 43.76 A: [laughter] 

42.61 47.96 B: i mean clearly clearly we have more weapons we have a bigger [laughter] army 

47.52 49.21 A: absolutely 

48.61 58.24 B: and we have and we've aggressed quite recently [laughter] against others in the world [mn] it's not hypothetical it's it's very clear it's very well documented it's ah 

58.31 66.20 B: it's it's very sad but you know if there were [cough] anyone that needs to ah to be knocked down and [mn] back to the stone age 

66.16 67.29 A: [noise] or th- 

66.45 69.15 B: fo- for the world's safety of course only 

68.48 70.51 A: oh yes of course 

69.45 72.94 B: then i would have to say it would be ah [lipsmack] america 

72.29 78.95 A: well it might be nice if we were taken down a peg i i don't know what i i personally don't want to live in the stone age but ah 

77.54 91.45 B: [laughter] well [cough] i was thinking about that today because um i was um volunteering at a [noise] high school in preparation for my teaching certification [mn] and i was looking around it's a pretty wealthy district 

91.43 92.98 B: and most of these kids 

93.38 106.59 B: i i was just sort of doing my um at the same time i was sort of meditating on my buddhist stuff and ah thinking about the kind of suffering that's going on in this classroom and the difference between the kind of suffering that they're going through 

106.64 110.46 B: and the kind of suffering that people who are starving or don't have a place to live 

110.55 113.19 B: or are ill are going through 

112.89 113.87 A: (( right [mn] )) 

113.34 119.47 B: and i mean from a buddhist perspective and in an i b- fully believe this there is no fundamental difference in the suffering 

119.47 125.63 B: but it's almost like and i don't know maybe i'm way off on this but it's almost like these 

125.57 134.56 B: um more abstract kinds of suffering these more refined forms of suffering like socializing and ah dealing with information and and a- 

134.58 138.96 B: learning to live with a weird ego in a weird society that's very ego driven 

139.11 142.70 B: that's more complicated and torturous [laughter] 

142.71 146.90 B: than the simple fact of physical needs that need to be met 

148.15 153.34 A: hm like you almost paint it out like it's a choice between the two i mean 

152.59 156.99 B: well it's it's that's it almost seems like we've progressed from one to another 

154.52 155.08 A: (( [mn] )) 

156.64 159.39 A: i think it's i think it's um 

160.23 168.58 A: [lipsmack] fair to say that physical need probably trumps the abstract ones but i don't think people who are wondering around with a lot of physical need 

168.50 176.62 A: are you know blissfully relieved of all the [laughter] all the suffering that the kids in your class go through 

172.03 173.10 B: no 

176.30 178.95 B: no no i yeah it's not that [noise] 

177.54 181.12 A: they just probably have a very different perspective on it 

180.87 188.66 B: [sigh] well the thing about it is i guess i see people are more willing to work together on those simple basic needs 

187.10 187.66 A: (( [cough] )) 

189.15 195.06 B: they it brings a seeing people in that situation [noise] seeing that kind of suffering 

195.03 208.44 B: brings out ah a reaction in a lot of people that's much more compassionate i think and it seems like we've we've pretty clearly ah mastered most of that and if we really really wanted to as a 

199.15 200.82 A: right 

208.42 214.19 B: as a species i think we could do a pretty good job of of more or less eradicating that on the planet 

213.73 216.55 A: you mean eradicating famine and 

214.97 217.42 B: [mn] yeah famine and housing 

217.02 218.85 A: housing problems [noise] 

217.99 223.17 B: just that just basically those two needs essentially and maybe ah start to work on the health one 

223.35 229.09 B: but the funny thing is instead of doing that we've gone on to this whole other complicated ah mess of like [noise] 

229.20 243.04 B: how how titillated can we make our senses and how complicated can we make our social interactions and how much sooner can we get kids to start thinking about breeding [laughter] i mean i couldn't believe what i saw on campus today these little girls are you know between 

233.11 234.39 A: [laughter] 

236.76 238.63 A: right [laughter] right 

242.84 246.42 B: i suppose thirteen and seventeen and they all look like they're 

246.48 261.14 B: what i would have to say is nubile dressed this dress says well not dress i mean it's all shrink wrapped clothing with various parts exposed [noise] extremely tight and very exposed it was a cold rainy day well cold for the bay area but ah i 

248.78 249.69 A: right 

253.54 254.86 A: yeah right 

255.73 256.85 A: yeah 

257.20 258.00 A: yeah 

258.30 259.17 A: yeah 

259.51 260.72 A: yeah 

261.15 271.03 B: mean and they're not even conscious that they're more or less just hawking themselves [laughter] and and [cough] the guys i mean what are they going to do they're they're mostly testosterone 

265.23 266.48 A: [laughter] that's right [mn] 

271.54 274.21 B: it's a crazy crazy thing 

272.78 276.21 A: it makes me wonder how much ah 

276.86 279.17 A: my parents might have ah 

279.84 282.58 A: looked at us ah you know ah 

282.62 285.49 A: ah looked at me in that way or 

285.28 287.27 B: (( yeah )) 

285.80 292.19 A: you know i mean i i i wonder 'cause i had the same experience and um i'm ah 

289.72 290.70 B: uh-huh 

292.57 294.25 A: i'm thirty six 

294.44 307.15 A: and i look at girls in high school and college now and i think good gosh would you put some clothes on and then i think terribly old thinking that and i'm not very i mean i'm not very old to be thinking 

294.71 295.27 B: (( [noise] )) 

302.14 303.20 B: uh-huh 

304.52 305.48 B: [laughter] 

306.03 308.69 B: (( [noise] )) 

307.22 318.97 A: to be feeling old for some thoughts and i wonder is it really my age or is it that our culture has shifted so quickly is it you know is it really that they're that ah 

309.18 310.28 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

316.19 317.10 B: oh 

319.28 321.77 A: that it's that it's that ah 

322.44 323.85 B: (( it's like )) 

322.57 324.78 A: (( [mn] you know i'm i- )) 

324.82 336.25 B: i have to say i think it's i mean i know exactly what you're saying 'cause i'm thirty five and but i don't feel that way because i mean the in terms of the ah questioning i have no doubts because i [noise] i lived in a pretty ah 

324.90 325.60 A: (( i- )) 

336.44 340.32 B: [mn] pretty radical subculture for quite a while i was a punk rocker and a gothic 

339.90 340.99 A: mhm 

340.41 347.27 B: and i've been to a lot of s. and m. stuff and [noise] i've seen some pretty extreme examples of what can happen in our society 

346.82 348.04 A: mhm 

347.45 353.50 B: but now i mean this is this is not a subculture this is the mainstream 

353.08 354.33 A: (( [mn] right )) 

353.73 359.16 B: and it's being promoted by britney spears and that other s- [noise] christine aguilera 

357.28 358.37 A: well 

358.38 361.94 A: being promoted by pepsi cola and records 

360.52 362.51 B: oh e- everybody 

362.60 366.13 B: well they're but the- it's not like the ar- the artists aren't making money off of it too 

366.36 370.92 B: [noise] yes the media's and the advertising ah industry is certainly 

369.45 382.70 A: i just you know i don't i didn't think i don't think the driving force behind it is britney spears i don't think she's sitting at home thinking oh okay what kind of image should i push you know [laughter] sh- she's sitting at home thinking what's that 

378.71 392.08 B: [mn] i you know but i really wonder about christine aguilera [noise] i really wonder okay with britney spears i could because she's fairly talented but with christine aguilera it really seems like she's just blatantly 

385.58 386.73 A: right 

391.89 394.69 B: pushing that envelope because it's there 

394.93 401.28 B: and that may not be because she wants to portray a pu- a certain image maybe she just wants to be recognized and get more attention 

400.17 402.14 A: (( mm [lipsmack] yeah )) 

401.78 410.55 B: but [mn] i de- it's really strange i mean okay w- now we're marketing to to more or less children you know elementary school children 

410.58 416.04 B: [mn] the kinds of like the um abercrombie and fitch got busted for selling g. string thong underwear 

416.96 418.54 A: [laughter] they did 

416.99 424.69 B: they did they they had to take it off their shelves they were selling it to nine and ten year olds no they they marketed it and that's a major preppy chain 

418.96 420.19 A: no kidding 

421.25 422.28 A: wow 

423.03 424.05 A: wow 

424.55 425.61 A: right 

424.98 429.83 B: these are not freaks and weirdoes and counter culture people who are experimenting with odd 

429.72 430.71 A: right 

430.07 440.83 B: [mn] lifestyles these are people who are basically preparing kids for their sexuality way before their body's even ready [sigh] and i mean in some respects i could see that american society is 

430.80 431.64 A: right 

435.64 436.92 A: right 

441.00 443.98 B: a little distant and removed from our biology 

444.48 447.76 B: because let's face it by eighteen it's been a couple years of 

447.88 450.60 B: of things lying fallow if nobody's breeding [laughter] 

451.81 452.98 A: what's that 

452.50 461.94 B: i said [laughter] by by eighteen years old [mn] it's been a couple of years of things lying fallow if if there's been no breeding i mean that's a ripe ripe breeding time and if we were 

457.56 459.82 A: oh i see right [laughter] 

460.42 461.78 A: right right 

461.84 468.65 B: really needing to be a robust species we would be taking full advantage of that but you know we have all kind of augmented 

463.85 464.71 A: right 

465.40 466.40 A: (( right [mn] )) 

468.90 470.36 B: or augmented ah 

470.51 473.26 B: aspects of our our society to take care of those 

473.42 476.23 B: needs like hospitals and all the modern 

473.52 474.49 A: right 

475.40 481.96 A: right well i've heard it argued though that our our you know our minds and our culture have 

482.00 482.56 A: (( [cough] )) 

482.87 489.51 A: evolved much faster than our bodies have and that you know part of the psychological dilemma comes from 

489.59 500.75 A: bodies that just haven't haven't changed in all that much in a thousand years you know and a thousand years ago [mn] you know eighteen was a good time to be breeding 'cause you weren't going to live past thirty 

500.17 501.61 B: true true 

502.28 507.44 B: yeah i i actually think it's it i think it's not that our minds have evolved it's that [lipsmack] 

503.28 504.18 A: (( [noise] )) 

508.09 513.39 B: because i don't really see any fundamental change in our psychology and i see no fundamental understanding of our psychology 

514.30 518.76 B: [mn] i don't see that there's any improvement over the basic principle of human suffering 

518.41 519.46 A: mhm 

518.91 522.17 B: and th- that technology has been around for thousands of years 

522.62 524.62 B: in my opinion um 

523.64 524.64 A: right 

524.67 529.23 B: so there are principles by which people could live their lives and th- they do you know 

529.36 532.21 B: they do function in societies on rather large scales 

532.70 536.75 B: that ah allow a more more or less um 

537.29 537.85 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

537.87 546.18 B: a society that's geared more towards the improvement of the human condition and less towards the pavement of the planetary condition 

545.73 547.78 A: [mn] right [laughter] so 

547.34 558.75 B: and i i i mean we have so now we have opportunities and we have complications that present you know more complicated ah mental situations 

558.76 566.31 B: but i don't see us responding to them any differently i mean we still work on very basic territorial principles a lot of biological principles 

563.90 565.15 A: yeah yeah 

565.77 566.88 A: yeah 

566.33 569.35 B: ah basically permeate politics 

568.81 574.10 A: yeah i was just going to say so speaking of which ah what should the [laughter] united states do about iraq 

573.99 576.29 B: what should they do about iraq [mn] 

575.25 576.51 A: yeah 

576.43 585.00 B: well i don't actually think it's about iraq i think what the states should do is spend all their time and energy trying to fix get a separate state for palestine 

584.22 587.00 A: the palestinian problem i was just going to say 

585.27 592.26 B: an- and israel and ge- and stop stop making money off selling weapons to israel and stop allowing them to behave in ways that o- 

588.92 589.93 A: yeah 

591.84 592.90 A: yeah 

592.28 594.87 B: other countries would never allow [noise] [noise] 

593.78 603.09 A: i i think it's a i think it's a it's ah ah sh- a sad and almost a crime that the media have have 

603.09 607.89 A: skirted around the palestinian issue completely 

607.72 618.28 A: ah first you know as we sent troops to afghanistan and now it seems likely we send troops to iraq they'll still ignore the palestinian issue that's behind it all 

617.87 624.13 B: yeah yeah it's very very skewed and it's really hard for people ah to get a view of it 

623.05 625.60 A: and it's ironic that you know 

625.52 639.28 A: when the when there were ah during you know the troubles in northern ireland there was plenty of american press coverage you know and we knew everything that was going on in belfast and we had plenty of people sending money to the 

630.22 631.08 B: uh-huh 

632.48 634.34 B: (( yeah )) 

635.71 636.56 B: uh-huh 

639.59 650.72 A: ah to the to ah i._r._a. and other operatives because there were irish here and in the united states we felt you know that that should be a separate state 

650.09 652.46 B: [noise] clearly yeah 

651.01 664.71 A: and people were engaged in it politically but the palestinian issue which is to my mind has a lot of big similarities ah people a don't want to hear about it b. they don't want to think about it c. they don't want their money involved [mn] 

653.24 654.15 B: uh-huh 

664.20 670.51 B: right except unless they're um jewish or israeli yeah 

669.08 670.88 A: right or palestinian 

670.78 673.55 B: well palestinians there just aren't that many i mean 

670.98 672.07 A: [laughter] 

673.26 675.75 A: yeah i know right they're badly outnumbered 

675.56 680.26 B: yeah it's a shame it is a shame and then and 

677.15 678.84 A: (( um )) 

680.48 690.47 B: it's it's not like ah i mean actually i've seen some some reasonable reasonable um coverage but it's just the extent you know and 

690.58 695.93 B: that's what i have a really good friend from ah riad we ah we were in in school in boulder together 

695.64 697.03 A: mhm 

696.80 701.77 B: [lipsmack] and and it was [noise] really hard sometimes because there's this cultural gap where he really is 

702.47 709.32 B: um just like he's been he's been d- indoctrinated to believe that there's a zionist conspiracy against the arab countries 

708.69 709.98 A: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

709.73 719.89 B: and i mean it's just a matter of you know seeing things from that bizarre perspective long enough and then you then you see everything from that bizarre perspective but on the other hand [cough] how can it b
