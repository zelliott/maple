19.22 19.79 A: (( [mn] )) 

29.37 31.35 B: know probably christmas what do you think 

31.86 33.16 A: um 

34.56 37.05 A: well let's see 

38.08 39.92 A: (( i don't know i think um )) 

40.94 41.86 A: (( uh )) 

42.41 54.43 A: christmas kinda gets a little uh uh uh commercial for me these days uh you know it's i i guess i am christian and it's just the way that the whole um 

55.09 58.77 A: thing gets sort of reduced to uh 

58.80 68.27 A: just uh presents and santa claus kinda bothers me um i might go for like thanksgiving let's say um which 

62.78 63.80 B: mhm 

68.46 73.11 A: you know i is always a time when i get together with my family and uh 

73.47 74.52 A: um 

74.61 76.10 A: you know sort of uh 

76.17 80.82 A: the cooking and sharing and stuff like that uh i really like 

80.86 84.96 B: well i will say this i agree with you totally about the commercialism 

84.97 95.51 B: going on i try my hardest not to go to stores [laughter] around this time of year but i do i mean that's the reason i like it i like it 'cause that's when my family gets together and that's when we 

90.64 91.48 A: (( uh-huh )) 

95.41 96.68 A: right 

96.36 97.29 B: uh 

97.36 101.49 B: that's when we get together and thanksgiving is usually a smaller thing 

98.98 99.92 A: yes 

101.70 103.35 B: just my immediate family 

101.84 108.08 A: yeah i g- i mean we we usually get together around at at christmas too um uh uh 

108.11 109.52 A: it's 

110.25 115.08 A: i'm married and so it's always a trade off you you do thanksgiving at one 

115.47 116.23 A: (( uh )) 

116.28 119.37 A: you know at at one family's uh 

119.41 129.29 A: uh house you know like at you know like you do like we did thanksgiving at my parents' this year so we'll do christmas with her parents that kind of thing 

128.67 130.75 B: right and it trades off 

130.78 132.02 A: right 

133.10 135.10 A: um 

133.38 136.51 B: so what kind of holiday would you have if you could make one up

139.68 142.20 A: hm um 

142.66 144.21 A: let's see well in japan 

143.10 151.25 B: maybe one that's non secular and that just was totally about family i guess that's that's kind of like thanksgiving um 

148.38 149.25 A: (( uh-huh )) 

151.68 153.57 B: but then i also have issues with 

154.50 158.48 B: how thanksgiving came about too you know like it just makes me think about 

158.94 161.18 A: (( [noise] how you know )) 

159.21 163.34 B: you know breaking trees and and you know little 

161.70 162.77 A: right

250.21 252.20 B: it feels like they've all been invented 

256.31 261.41 A: is about uh traditions you know so to just sort of 

258.78 259.93 B: mhm

309.15 310.56 B: [laughter] 

313.53 315.81 B: [laughter] 

322.51 324.86 B: [laughter] how 'bout the unh- the unholiday

326.86 330.82 B: [laughter] where you don't buy anything you don't buy anything for it at all 

330.78 331.81 A: (( oh )) 

331.37 332.98 B: anti commercial 

332.87 334.23 A: right yeah 

333.57 336.31 B: 'cause that's a little more original at least than 

336.55 348.10 B: trying to find something else to celebrate find something else to be thankful for or whatever when all that it really is is a marketing ploy [laughter] not all it is to people but that's what it is that's what it's being 

343.70 345.09 A: right right 

348.15 351.11 B: reduced to kind of like you were saying about christmas [sigh] 

350.92 351.98 A: right 

352.64 354.57 B: yeah i think that's my final answer 

354.61 356.14 A: okay [laughter] 

355.55 358.42 B: [laughter] [sigh] oh 

359.42 360.56 A: oh right 

359.46 360.82 B: any other holidays 

360.67 364.84 A: any other holidays any other um 

360.89 361.63 B: (( that all )) 

365.77 373.65 A: well let's see i like the fourth of july you know the fireworks and everything um i mean i think um 

374.15 383.05 A: i think easter is the most important holiday in the christian calendar and i i think i think christmas tends to kind of overshadow it which 

383.34 387.45 A: [mn] you know just because it's so much more commercial um so i guess 

386.35 387.30 B: mhm 

387.99 391.62 A: from a religious point of view i'd have to point to easter 

391.68 396.20 B: i think christmas has gotten kinda out of hand with how much money people are spending 

391.72 392.66 A: (( uh )) 

396.16 397.20 A: yeah 

396.65 399.14 B: now compared to you know even like 

399.19 401.51 B: fifteen twenty years ago [sigh] 

401.46 403.15 A: yeah yeah 

403.74 405.04 A: um 

406.00 407.56 A: other holidays 

407.60 412.25 A: i mean you know not i mean halloween is is a fun holiday when you have kids 

412.32 413.36 B: mhm 

413.58 414.31 A: (( um )) 

415.40 421.12 A: so um that that's that's definitely a a high point of the year now that i have kids 

415.60 416.27 B: (( how )) 

421.84 422.83 B: old are they 

423.05 426.50 A: uh one and and four
