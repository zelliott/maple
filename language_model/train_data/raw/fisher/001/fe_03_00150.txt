4.66 8.27 A: so what do you think about arms inspections in iraq 

7.90 16.40 B: um well i'm not sure it should the u._s.'s first priority right now i guess i haven't 

16.55 19.29 B: exactly been convinced that um 

19.53 22.41 B: that it poses any real threat right now it seems to be 

22.50 25.63 B: there seems to be another agenda at play um 

25.32 26.45 A: yeah 

26.15 27.71 B: that that bush is 

28.43 30.22 B: you know covering up or or 

30.37 36.53 B: i don't know if it's trying to divert from the war on terrorism and how we haven't gotten bin laden yet or if there are oil interests or 

37.19 38.97 B: you know who knows but 

39.12 40.32 B: so how about about you 

39.30 39.91 A: yeah 

40.68 42.98 A: for me i think like i'm glad we're 

43.09 45.84 A: doing it i do think it's important to do and i 

45.94 50.53 A: kind of think that the rest of the world isn't going to do it you know it's kind of going to be us 

50.96 52.03 B: mhm 

51.20 52.97 A: with support or nobody 

53.00 53.66 B: right 

53.54 58.64 A: but i also agree that it's not actually safety driven it's agenda driven 

58.73 59.31 B: mhm 

59.25 63.23 A: it's kind of like you know ends and means questions i agree with 

63.34 71.82 A: the ends but i think his reasons for it are purely political and have nothing to do with act- the actual welfare of americans like 

72.14 73.02 B: right 

72.83 80.16 A: i mean i i don't know and honestly i voted for him i mean like i support most of his programs i'm pretty conservative and everything but 

80.90 81.73 A: but i'm a realist 

81.85 85.71 A: too you know and i think this is about reelection it's not about 

81.93 82.55 B: yeah 

85.75 86.92 B: yeah i'm not 

86.49 87.84 A: protecting america 

87.40 91.90 B: right i'm not exactly sure what it's about and i think that it opens up um 

106.87 107.40 B: they 

107.60 108.17 B: you know 

108.73 109.38 A: yeah 

109.69 118.46 B: so i i don't know if we're if we're planning i mean i don't think we're planning to invade north korea but there is that question of how far should we go with this and 

118.93 121.93 B: i think there are other countries that have potential too and 

122.27 126.17 A: yeah i think you're probably right on target again we've got the oil question 

126.98 134.24 A: you know and yeah we have oil we can use in the u._s. but we'd rather not use that so that we have it as a last resort 

134.14 134.72 B: mhm 

134.78 137.46 A: you know and i think you're right that hmm we don't get 

137.90 139.94 A: you know anything from north korea 

140.42 141.46 B: right 

140.61 145.50 A: you know we don't really get anything from the other countries that might pose a threat like 

145.94 147.76 A: (( )) we think india 

148.07 148.77 A: you know is 

148.51 149.35 B: right 

148.96 153.09 A: is testing war heads and everything like we don't really get anything from them 

153.30 154.17 B: right 

153.33 155.06 A: so fine you know 

155.33 161.20 B: yeah yeah it's hard to it's it's so hard to know what's really going on 

160.14 161.84 A: yeah that's so true 

161.51 164.84 B: i mean it's it's pretty frustrating with our media system that 

165.26 167.42 A: yeah it's true and like really 

168.37 168.95 A: i don't know it's 

169.53 171.79 A: big confusing question about is america 

174.00 174.83 B: mhm 

177.26 179.24 A: say that well we're a big country and 

179.51 180.77 A: we want to look after our own 

180.98 183.13 A: so that makes us the world watch dogs 

183.73 184.38 A: because 

184.59 190.40 A: you know we have to protect ourselves but at times i start to wonder why is this even any of our business 

184.66 185.53 B: right 

190.43 191.21 B: right 

191.32 192.04 B: right 

191.51 192.80 A: you know like it's that 

192.96 197.15 A: you know catch twenty two between being a global community and 

197.62 202.21 A: respecting sovereignty of all the nations and just doing your own thing like 

202.46 203.79 B: right and it seems 

214.12 214.48 B: they're 

214.68 216.12 B: they were saying that basically if 

216.36 222.81 B: the u._s. invaded iraq that iraq wouldn't necessary attack back at the u._s. but that they would at attack other countries in the middle east 

223.24 228.35 A: oh that's interesting the people who cooperated perhaps or o._k. yeah 

224.54 225.16 B: and 

226.65 235.21 B: right right and i think they said especially israel that iraq would maybe go after israel because of the ties to the u._s. and um 

230.83 231.53 A: yeah 

231.92 233.17 A: well we are yeah 

235.93 240.88 B: and again you know it's kind of giving us a liberty that that 

237.80 238.45 A: yeah 

241.14 247.38 B: you know there definitely i don't want iraq to have nuclear weapons because i don't trust saddam hussein 

241.97 242.32 A: yeah 

246.63 247.49 A: right yeah 

247.50 249.35 B: but yeah i i 

249.72 251.58 B: there are just so many issues at play 

251.74 252.25 A: yeah 

252.39 253.68 A: it's really like 

253.92 256.17 A: the the honest version for me is 

256.30 256.70 A: i'm 

256.89 263.52 A: very uncomfortable most of the time with most of the things that we do as americans and foreign policy 

263.60 264.44 B: mhm 

264.26 267.17 A: like on a basis of principal 

267.73 268.31 A: but 

268.79 269.46 A: i'm glad we're 

269.74 270.77 A: doing it because 

270.92 271.71 A: it's still 

272.09 276.79 A: kind of my ass at stake you know what i mean it's like it's 

273.99 277.08 B: right right 

277.04 279.94 A: it's like i mean that's the version i mean 

280.08 282.20 A: like i still feel better kind of 

282.35 285.81 A: playing on the winning team i guess you know like and 

284.10 284.85 B: right 

286.25 289.31 A: and i do feel bad for the bad things that happen 

287.81 288.46 B: mhm 

289.39 290.11 B: right 

290.11 291.31 A: for our privileges 

291.42 292.21 B: right 

291.86 294.41 A: but then i think well i could be somewhere else 

294.25 294.86 B: right 

294.87 296.02 A: and that would not be 

296.47 298.03 A: such a good thing you know like i have 

298.71 303.50 A: i don't know i lived in france for a year and when i left america to live in france i was thinking 

304.27 313.24 A: i'm just going to give up my citizenship this country sucks i'm going to go live in france and i'm going to stay there forever and it's going to be great and after about three months in france i was like 

310.31 311.16 B: right 

313.77 318.02 A: i love living in france but i'm an american for life you know like 

321.32 322.36 A: exactly 

323.73 324.11 B: for 

323.81 324.57 A: o._k. 

324.23 324.55 B: um 

324.68 326.75 B: six months and it was the same thing when i was 

326.48 327.25 A: yeah 

326.86 331.95 B: leaving i was like well maybe i won't ever go back and then you realize there are so many things that 

332.28 334.23 B: that you're just accustomed to 

334.53 335.07 A: yeah 

335.55 339.80 A: yeah and it wasn't even i mean the lifestyle in france is fabulous you know i mean 

339.41 339.99 B: mhm 

340.63 341.73 A: i really enjoyed 

341.87 342.63 A: that but 

343.06 345.70 A: but it was definitely the perspectives of 

346.33 347.38 A: you know like 

348.63 349.67 A: you know i guess there is 

350.48 355.78 A: to me it felt like a lot of the political questions in france had such blinders on 

356.15 360.46 A: like everyone would say of course we want to be protected and there should be no defense 

360.96 361.56 B: mhm 

361.52 362.56 A: you know and 

363.09 366.10 A: of course we want the government to do everything for us 

366.28 367.12 A: and 

366.48 366.91 B: hm 

367.37 368.43 A: you know like 

369.07 370.40 A: and it's a 

370.53 372.74 A: shame how much they tax us it's terrible 

373.32 374.14 B: yeah 

373.32 375.91 A: you know i was kind of like well which do you want 

375.44 377.08 B: right right 

376.28 378.85 A: you know and so i realized that you know 

379.37 380.11 A: i do 

380.43 386.00 A: want those things you know like i mean the war in iraq you know i don't like the idea of war but 

386.46 387.14 A: again 

388.09 388.76 A: better 

388.94 390.58 A: the big guys doing it 

390.73 392.51 A: and getting it cleaned up 

392.90 393.38 B: yeah 

393.44 393.92 A: you know 

393.86 396.87 B: i think i think there are questions too 

397.02 400.66 B: i guess to kind of go along with about whether or not 

401.04 407.79 B: uh i don't know if it's that we're maintaining our lifestyle at the expense of other people or if 

408.11 412.19 B: if there if we could have maybe a different foreign policy so that 

412.39 416.42 B: you know maybe as many people wouldn't get hurt or something but 

416.56 418.49 B: i i don't know i mean 

418.67 430.16 B: like i can't even phrase what i'm trying to see but it seems like you know some of our like our oil interests in the middle east for example that we've created ties with you know israel and saudi arabia people who aren't necessarily like 

423.78 424.28 A: yeah 

428.54 429.10 A: yeah 

430.52 434.83 B: you know pro humanitarian efforts and 

432.58 434.16 A: right yeah yeah 

434.93 435.41 B: if 

435.91 438.96 B: if there's a way in which you know if we were more 

439.15 443.09 B: concerned about those kinds of things if the political situation would be different 

443.26 447.29 A: i've wondered about that too but then i also wonder you know 

447.71 449.91 A: and i don't know if this is a big western 

450.61 451.83 A: or if this is a valid 

452.44 453.27 A: argument 

453.37 454.88 A: but there's been so much 

455.23 457.33 A: in fighting for so long 

457.46 458.06 B: mhm 

458.09 461.56 A: in those places that i wonder how much difference our presence makes 

461.63 462.30 B: right 

462.38 470.66 A: you know but then that's been a huge argument in africa and well i mean half the reasons for those problems is the western colonization and 

462.40 463.00 B: right 

470.29 471.25 B: right 

470.88 473.23 A: and independent stuff so i mean 

473.41 485.33 A: you know and and the middle east i mean definitely a bunch of western countries coming in and saying oh we made a new country now you know that doesn't really help either so i mean i don't know how much of that i wonder sometimes 

479.82 480.92 B: right 

482.01 482.88 B: right 

486.36 487.98 A: would they just be having their own wars 

488.43 490.01 A: independent of us anyway 

488.47 489.31 B: yeah 

490.71 492.79 A: or is it really kind of 

493.26 494.79 A: our finger in the pie that 

495.13 496.04 A: kept things going 

496.21 498.91 B: right right yeah it's really difficult to say 

496.25 496.80 A: you know 

499.13 499.72 A: yeah 

499.58 502.20 B: the and probably really the only way would be to 

502.33 509.24 B: well i mean we wouldn't know now even if we pulled out of everything now we wouldn't we wouldn't be able to tell 

506.12 507.11 A: right yeah 

508.59 509.56 A: yeah it's true
