350.64 351.44 A: you know and then it's 

351.56 355.28 A: then it starts to feel like christmas and that kind of thing so it's nice

404.76 405.42 B: right right 

405.32 415.91 A: so normally we have all the eight eight trees and she decorates them once and then she puts a plastic sack over them and puts them in the attic for the year and then brings down and takes the sack off you know and it's christmas 

414.72 415.28 B: right right 

416.18 417.53 A: well she had to like 

417.68 425.26 A: take everything off of the trees when we moved so now she had to go and re-decorate and you know she i came home for thanksgiving i thought it was christmas 

425.49 430.90 A: your like mom that is absolutely crazy she goes oh i had to i wouldn't have gotten it done in time if i hadn't so
