32.62 41.20 A: so uh we're supposed to talk about arms inspections in iraq right yeah so do any- do you know anything about it 

37.20 37.56 B: yes 

41.75 42.71 B: um 

43.42 44.93 B: i 

45.03 49.86 B: not a whole lot i should probably know a little bit more um i'm in the army 

48.18 48.95 A: uh huh 

50.10 51.66 A: uh huh oh really 

50.80 51.29 B: uh 

51.49 52.59 B: i am yeah 

52.20 53.14 A: cool 

53.21 55.81 B: uh so they're sending me to grad school right now 

55.83 56.55 A: i see 

56.07 58.02 B: um so i guess 

58.16 58.66 B: uh 

59.38 61.02 B: in the the sense of of 

61.27 63.34 B: a military soldier that would 

63.77 69.75 B: be put in harms way to go to wa- war defending the country defending other countries um 

69.02 69.42 A: mhm 

69.84 70.66 B: that i 

71.54 76.64 B: i k- kind of a vested interest in that i i don't like to think that there are 

75.62 76.09 A: yeah 

76.77 77.24 B: um 

77.43 79.23 B: there are things out there that could 

79.80 82.22 B: harm us any more than just the typical things i guess 

81.98 82.41 A: mhm 

82.51 82.93 A: mhm 

83.06 83.47 B: um 

85.51 87.45 B: and what do you think 

87.73 88.65 A: uh 

89.73 94.01 A: really um it's kind of hard to say because 

95.57 98.00 A: so you do think that uh if 

99.09 106.41 A: iraq is not disarmed completely then they're they can really potentially be a threat to the united states and to the world as a whole 

107.14 107.91 B: i think so 

108.11 108.73 A: uh huh 

108.14 108.46 B: um 

108.80 109.05 B: i 

109.58 111.29 B: i guess i think too that they're 

112.24 113.16 B: they kind of 

113.36 119.77 B: i don't know again the media plays a large part in this so who knows what is actually going on on the ground um 

119.94 120.34 B: but 

120.65 124.18 B: but from what we hear from the media then it seems like 

124.53 127.89 B: not only can they be their own bad guy but they're kind of 

128.34 128.94 B: they're kind of 

129.26 133.39 B: big brother to all bad guys in that if they have um 

131.05 131.61 A: uh huh 

133.53 134.85 B: i think that if they have 

135.17 135.96 B: the weapons 

136.07 136.34 B: that 

136.52 137.58 B: they probably don't 

138.00 141.21 B: have any bad feelings about sharing them with other countries 

141.09 141.51 A: yeah 

141.43 143.92 B: um and so that kind of proliferation 

144.09 144.77 A: i see 

144.57 145.95 B: makes me a little bit nervous 

146.24 146.84 A: i see 

148.21 152.03 A: yeah for me i think right now the u._n. is inspecting uh 

166.23 168.14 A: weapons like nuclear weapons or 

168.58 170.78 A: biological weapons and stuff like that 

170.88 172.06 A: so do you think those are 

172.30 173.06 A: actually the 

173.45 177.70 A: the only dangerous and most threatening weapons nuclear and 

177.90 182.98 A: biological or are you talking about disarming iraq as a whole 

184.36 184.86 B: um 

184.91 185.60 A: or um 

185.73 187.32 B: well i think the nuclear weapons 

187.67 188.88 B: that's where they've got 

189.40 191.20 B: the long arm reach that can 

191.31 194.44 B: that can out and touch us where we live um 

193.64 194.13 A: uh huh 

194.67 195.47 B: and so 

196.05 196.48 B: uh 

197.05 200.40 B: i think anyone in the world especially if you've got 

200.85 201.27 B: um 

201.68 204.28 B: military government dictator kind of situation 

204.60 205.94 B: um i think that that's 

206.41 207.60 B: that's very dangerous 

207.86 208.31 A: yeah 

207.98 210.23 B: i guess as a soldier on the ground then 

210.57 211.05 B: the 

211.75 214.43 B: the biological bio terror kind of things 

214.41 214.85 A: mhm 

215.00 216.19 B: um that probably 

217.02 218.43 B: that and of course mine fields 

219.19 219.51 B: um 

220.95 222.38 B: would concern me a little more 

221.28 221.91 A: yeah 

222.78 224.40 A: yeah 

224.52 230.38 A: it's uh i don't really know that there is if 

230.54 239.52 A: actually there is a war happening so if you guys decided to attack iraq and there is a war going on what do you think about the americans attitudes 

239.76 240.77 A: towards that will be 

247.26 256.47 A: say if of course they will know they know that the amer- the government is trying to defend national interests of u._s. and they are trying to protect 

256.57 260.48 A: why not just if you ask just maybe (( )) 

266.04 266.54 B: right 

269.65 271.58 A: claim they are doing this for the good of the people 

272.43 276.70 A: p- there are people who are just generally anti war whatever kind of war it is 

275.40 276.08 B: mhm 

277.43 278.00 A: (( )) 

278.09 282.48 A: as soldier or maybe if you think of yourself not as just as a citizen 

282.98 285.17 A: uh what do you think about that 

286.45 286.91 B: well i 

288.07 292.28 B: i think that anytime the u._s. isn't in war then you have 

292.51 296.69 B: very def- like you said very definite vocal anti war kind of people 

296.72 297.15 A: yeah 

296.99 297.41 B: um 

298.02 298.41 B: but 

298.66 299.34 B: i don't 

299.60 300.17 B: just 

300.32 304.28 B: in the the last couple of conflicts or involvements that i've seen 

304.64 305.07 B: um 

305.56 307.29 B: i i think that once 

308.04 309.41 B: the president and 

309.71 311.97 B: and congress and everyone commits to something 

312.29 314.00 B: that you have a lot of people 

314.22 316.33 B: although they may not agree with war 

316.39 316.87 A: mhm 

316.64 321.07 B: then they are going to support the u._s. government and they're going to support the u._s. soldiers 

321.21 321.64 A: mhm 

321.37 327.64 B: um of course they would like to try to find another maybe more peaceful situation um kind of mediation 

326.05 326.51 A: mhm 

327.81 329.64 B: that didn't require war 

329.69 330.14 A: mhm 

329.99 333.91 B: but i think they're still supportive but you do still have the people who won't be supportive 

334.17 334.69 A: mhm 

334.36 335.23 B: no matter what 

335.69 343.10 A: as you say you believe you that even there were anti war people so as long as there is a war happening people will be supportive 

343.84 346.32 B: i think so and i i think that's what the government 

344.81 345.19 A: mhm 

346.62 348.16 A: is trying to promote 

347.14 356.43 B: ultimately trying to look they realize they're never going to have a hundred percent support i mean of course this is a democracy so uh 

351.93 355.51 A: yeah yeah actu- nothing nothing 

355.61 362.45 A: nothing gets a hundred percent support you know basically there are all kinds of people all kinds of thoughts yeah 

357.37 359.95 B: exactly 

362.21 362.68 B: mhm 

363.56 370.11 A: yeah that's true this is kind of similar to you know there was a situation in china just about two years ago when uh 

370.49 373.18 A: you know about the taiwan issue 

372.98 373.42 B: mhm 

373.42 377.62 A: yeah so and there was a time i guess in nineteen ninety nine 

377.80 382.74 A: people were saying that maybe you know the chinese government was considering using 

383.08 390.20 A: the military action to just take back taiwan and of course that never materialized and there was a debate on whether if 

385.98 386.41 B: mhm 

390.34 392.96 A: there there was a war whether people 

393.33 395.13 A: would all go out to support 

395.26 396.32 A: that 

396.45 397.31 A: and uh i was 

397.49 406.83 A: i was doing my masters thesis at that time so i looked at how the media approached these kind of issues and i compared how the american media and the chinese media 

406.99 412.77 A: were you know trying to report the um the the taiwan issue at that time and it was ki- 

412.93 415.28 A: kind of interesting um to see 

416.22 418.01 A: so like you said because 

418.13 419.52 A: for most people they just 

419.67 421.97 A: get information from the media 

422.10 424.57 A: so they believe that okay we are 

427.72 428.13 B: mhm 

436.80 439.83 A: you will definitely get another picture and people there will 

439.96 448.13 A: will be saying if there is a war between u._s. and iraq then we are defending our interests and they are invading us they are trying you know just to 

446.86 447.31 B: uh huh 

448.24 454.55 A: to destruct us and that's that's actually and i i got this idea because when i was doing research on um 

455.06 463.06 A: the uh american and the chinese medias reporting the taiwan issue in that year and i realized that yeah really the media 

463.22 474.76 A: the media are playing a very important role in manipulating the public minds and lot of times because people are busy and you know they can't spend their time researching on their own so they tend to believe 

465.68 466.13 B: uh huh 

475.27 480.99 A: especially if it happens repetitively they tend to believe whatever the media say and uh 

481.16 485.73 A: so really sometimes when i look at an inte- espe- especially a political issue 

486.02 495.03 A: i just try to you know see not just to to read something from one perspective to see different perspective but generally i'm kind of a 

491.85 492.30 B: mhm 

495.24 498.83 A: i'd have to say that i i'm more like anti war 

499.55 499.93 B: uh huh 

503.43 503.81 B: uh huh 

506.04 507.01 A: i don't know about this 

507.34 508.68 A: sometimes i feel this world is 

508.88 509.61 A: such a mess 

509.84 510.63 A: there are things 

511.27 511.69 B: yeah 

511.59 512.37 A: (( )) 

512.93 515.08 A: all kinds of people i just don't understand why people just 

515.21 517.75 A: don't just want to live peacefully you know it just 

519.30 522.42 A: yeah so i i don't know yeah 

521.39 521.65 B: so 

521.91 525.08 B: look- going along the lines of the media then 

525.44 526.55 B: what does 

526.77 528.41 B: the media in china 

528.46 529.11 A: mhm 

529.32 529.86 B: do they 

530.26 535.35 B: do they carry stuff about arms inspections in iraq and the u._s. in relation to 

533.78 537.28 A: oh definitely definitely yeah 

535.79 538.73 B: what what do they say is it different from what the u._s. 

539.25 540.21 B: media kind of says 

539.33 539.75 A: yeah 

540.24 542.54 A: yeah kind of because in china um 

542.71 548.99 A: you know it's kind of complicated because china does not want to encourage war 

549.36 549.77 B: mhm
