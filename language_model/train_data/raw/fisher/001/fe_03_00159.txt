3.24 4.13 A: hi 

4.25 4.79 B: hi 

5.22 8.13 B: um we were just on last time also 

8.62 9.99 A: i don't know when was the last time 

9.70 15.40 B: oh okay no no i'm so sorry um i just had i got registered twice 

15.57 16.00 A: uh-huh 

15.80 18.02 B: by accident for this u. penn survey 

17.85 18.24 A: uh-huh 

18.23 19.81 B: so um i got 

20.03 24.67 B: a phone call ten minutes ago and no one was on the other line so i talked to myself for ten minutes 

24.78 25.91 A: oh how funny 

25.76 26.99 B: it was horrible 

26.59 27.87 A: [laugh] 

27.23 31.56 B: and when you didn't pick up i'm like oh my god it's the same person 

30.61 30.90 A: [laugh] 

31.16 33.90 A: no they just ca- this is the first call that i've gotten tonight 

33.85 36.25 B: oh okay okay because i heard a pause and i'm like 

34.48 34.98 A: yeah 

36.61 38.37 B: not again 

37.75 42.21 A: [breath] well i'm glad you have so much to say then because i'm not really sure was it the same topic 

42.43 47.81 B: ah yes and i really don't know that much so i just babbled on and heard somebody was on the other line that 

48.13 48.98 B: couldn't hear and was 

49.09 51.62 B: talking to someone else i think it was like a call center 

52.06 53.32 B: and so i was like 

53.60 57.55 B: talking to someone and i heard them talking about christmas vacation in the background and i'm like 

57.70 64.14 B: that sounds like a good plan 

59.72 61.14 A: [laugh] 

63.94 65.71 A: [laugh] oh how funny 

65.14 69.60 B: [breath] yeah it was kind of horrible but not for me just for the people that i had to listen to 

67.71 68.86 A: [laugh] 

69.52 70.87 A: [laugh] 

70.20 71.59 B: [laugh] anyway [laugh] 

71.73 75.80 B: [laugh] i'm so happy that you're a live person 

73.66 73.91 A: [breath] 

74.02 75.76 A: [laugh] 

76.21 80.00 B: so um i don't know very much about iraq and i'll probably 

80.19 81.51 B: sound very stupid but um 

81.89 87.24 B: i ah [laugh] i guess (( )) i think that we should um 

87.42 91.74 B: keep up with our arms inspections and force i guess saddam hussein or i guess whoever is 

91.87 93.28 B: will be there to um 

93.50 93.83 B: show us 

93.94 97.71 B: [laugh] their cards and what they have and ah maybe 

98.05 104.65 B: we didn't do it by ourselves we could like get other countries to do it with us so we don't always seem like the bad guys and try to police the entire world 

104.97 105.25 B: [laugh] 

111.10 120.92 A: that's what we have i mean is it is it fair to have one nation to go in and say well you know we don't trust you i mean what gives us the moral authority to do that 

121.41 122.64 B: yeah yeah i 

122.25 123.01 A: you know what i mean 

123.15 125.43 B: yeah it's like wh- you know why (( )) 

125.61 126.31 B: we have a lot of 

126.44 128.09 B: money i guess (( )) 

127.44 128.07 A: right 

128.43 130.66 B: like you know then we seem like the 

130.88 131.72 B: bad guy and 

131.68 132.83 A: right right right 

132.55 134.89 B: yeah we want to seem like the good guy (( help )) 

134.72 135.49 A: right 

135.66 137.67 B: so i i don't know i was kind of 

137.84 147.19 B: when i was talking to myself last time i was trying to think of other countries that could like get together i don't know i mean we helped israel out a lot maybe they would 

139.30 140.56 A: [laugh] 

147.44 147.90 B: kind of 

148.01 151.52 B: they're already over there maybe they would help inspect iraq 

151.63 151.89 B: with 

151.98 153.11 B: (( )) actually that's 

153.60 155.50 B: i i mean i don't know if they have anything 

155.92 156.38 B: um 

157.07 157.51 B: you know if 

157.62 160.23 B: i guess they're enemies of most of the people over there in the middle east 

160.40 162.31 B: but maybe they could help us out or egypt 

162.43 164.53 B: they're kind of friendly with us maybe 

163.84 164.99 A: right 

164.76 166.89 B: maybe some of the other middle eastern countries could like 

167.21 169.73 B: get together and so it didn't seem like 

169.97 170.48 B: like the w- 

170.05 171.45 A: it's always the u._s. 

171.23 178.91 B: yeah even if we like you know kind of got canada in on it that wouldn't really they're not such a big i don't know what they do over there 

171.62 172.17 A: going in 

175.18 176.17 A: [laugh] 

178.88 183.58 A: so do you follow the news pretty much through what sources 

183.66 189.97 B: [laugh] nothing um i don't really i har- 

185.12 185.45 A: [breath] 

186.09 187.05 A: [laugh] 

190.06 191.17 B: it's horrible but i don't 

191.35 192.85 B: read the newspaper i kind of just 

193.50 194.00 B: um 

194.72 195.47 B: i don't know i 

195.70 196.44 B: i guess i watch 

196.58 197.96 B: t._v. but i don't really watch 

198.13 200.28 B: the news that much either i guess ah 

205.80 206.68 A: [laugh] 

208.48 209.67 A: [laugh] 

209.06 217.18 B: [laugh] so i don't i think i probably have a warped or very like simplified view of what's going on in the world um 

217.70 218.56 B: i um 

218.86 221.53 B: i was at i just ah graduated college and at 

221.76 224.27 B: school i never watched the news at all i just 

224.22 226.13 A: right because you're busy doing other stuff 

225.45 228.03 B: did homework all day so i was completely out of touch 

226.84 227.23 A: right 

228.33 232.25 B: until and sadly the only time i watched t._v. was like september eleventh and like 

232.60 237.80 B: a little bit after that i'd you know put on the news and see what was going on in our own country but other than that i'm 

238.21 241.57 B: probably one of the most clue less people taking this like 

240.02 241.06 A: [laugh] 

241.67 243.17 B: survey thing 

243.31 243.92 B: but um 

244.36 244.65 A: [breath] 

244.44 245.44 B: i don't know are you 

245.71 246.50 B: are you um 

246.60 250.59 B: because i a lot of the people i talked to were also either in school or just out of school 

250.25 255.39 A: right a lot of students yeah i'm i'm actually in grad school myself so 

254.48 255.98 B: oh wow where where did you go 

255.81 257.63 A: [breath] ah northern arizona 

256.19 256.47 B: (( )) 

257.55 258.56 B: oh wow i did i 

258.70 260.53 B: spoke to somebody else from arizona but i think 

260.63 261.42 B: they were um 

261.75 263.62 B: i don't know if they were a professor or a little bit older 

263.71 264.44 A: oh cool 

264.49 266.41 B: um yeah so um 

266.00 267.66 A: and are you are you from the east coast 

267.64 268.93 B: yes i um i was 

269.10 271.89 B: i just graduated from georgetown grad school last 

271.99 272.69 B: year i mean 

272.42 273.83 A: oh congratulations 

273.33 275.83 B: yeah oh thanks i did like a five year program so 

276.07 276.43 B: i'm 

276.54 282.76 B: it was like i went there undergrad and then i just added an extra year and kind of burned myself out so know i'm like completely done with school. 

282.53 283.41 A: [laugh] 

283.37 284.50 B: forever and ever 

285.07 287.87 A: and s- and what did you- what kind of five year program was it 

285.24 285.49 B: (( )) 

287.91 294.39 B: i was in linguistics which is why i have no clue what is going on in like history or government i just know some like language 

294.52 294.78 B: stuff 

294.87 297.98 A: right and so that's how you found out about the study then 

294.95 295.23 B: (( )) 

298.23 299.16 B: yes i um 

298.60 298.96 A: right 

299.32 300.70 B: the computer ah one of the 

301.06 302.02 B: computer teachers 

302.47 305.95 B: um does a little bit in linguistics so she forwarded um 

306.83 307.86 B: the survey 

307.98 309.96 B: or what ever it's called the u. penn 

310.11 311.73 B: ah study to um 

311.86 315.82 B: to the linguist list and i e because i'm lazy and i kind of 

316.02 318.36 B: don't like to lose contacts i kept myself on the ah 

318.04 321.03 A: [breath] you didn't de-subscribe yeah 

318.49 319.82 B: georgetown mailing list 

320.27 323.05 B: yeah so i'm like well good i'll make money 

322.91 325.72 A: cool so what area of linguistics did you study 

326.17 326.79 B: um i e- 

326.93 328.08 B: from my fifth year i studied 

328.19 337.31 B: ah computational linguistics so i guess like computers but i'm unemployed now so it doesn't seem like the best idea in retrospect but i also studied spanish so um 

329.27 330.62 A: wow 

337.93 341.95 B: some a little bit of italian so i i kind of you know a little hodgepodge here or there but 

342.19 343.64 B: um i was trying to 

344.14 347.89 B: um break into like language technology you know i was interested in a lot of 

348.00 350.94 B: speech type things so maybe speech recognition whatever and um 

350.29 350.98 A: right 

351.35 354.74 B: turns out that ah there are no jobs at least on the east coast doing that 

354.92 355.36 B: [laugh] 

356.00 356.58 B: yeah 

360.53 360.88 B: ah 

367.59 372.71 A: the way that technology is advancing are there any jobs on the west coast is it where you're located that they're aren't any 

372.15 375.73 B: you know what i don't you see i'm in new york so i would think that there was 

374.31 374.75 A: right 

375.86 382.49 B: the opportunity i mean i'm on long island but um you know i was looking for jobs in the city too you know anywhere that i could 

382.72 383.88 B: either commute to or 

384.11 385.10 B: you know if i moved 

385.25 386.59 B: so you know come home on the weekends 

386.84 389.84 B: and there is nothing um there were some companies that 

390.45 390.85 B: i 

390.99 394.68 B: had like i had on a list of i think like queens or one of the 

395.44 397.05 B: you know city colleges 

397.25 397.65 A: mhm 

397.36 398.31 B: had a big list of 

398.45 401.77 B: of firms that hire and all of the ones that were from new york in linguistics 

402.12 405.00 B: i either wrote and they said like no we're like basically 

405.46 406.39 B: cutting back and 

406.60 408.55 B: definitely not even thinking of hiring or 

408.78 410.36 B: am when i looked them up they're like 

410.63 414.88 B: their u._r._l. is no longer available so their website's completely gone and 

414.99 415.72 A: huh 

415.03 418.21 B: so is their company probably i think there were a lot of like 

418.68 420.10 B: um silicon valley 

420.19 420.56 B: ones 

420.66 421.12 A: right 

420.68 422.68 B: ah you know i i don't know 

423.20 424.80 B: i really actually have never been west 

424.91 426.57 B: so i can't tell you if they're all 

426.92 429.18 B: booming as much as it seems to on the internet but 

429.33 430.01 B: it looks like 

430.43 432.87 B: all the opportunities i've seen are either in canada 

433.04 434.47 B: europe or california 

433.18 433.54 A: mhm 

434.65 435.47 A: wow 

435.33 437.07 B: or so- the- some like government 

437.17 437.43 B: type 

437.83 438.51 B: linked ones 

438.75 439.25 A: right 

438.78 439.63 B: in d._c. 

440.08 443.59 B: and maybe like there's one company in boston but they're not 

443.79 445.26 B: apparently hiring or at least they're not 

445.45 447.74 B: talking to me [laugh] and um 

447.67 448.13 A: huh 

448.11 450.06 B: yeah it's and there's ah something like 

450.35 452.79 B: seattle i guess ah and some in ah 

453.24 456.69 B: there was one or two in like oregon i know (( )) that's funny because i had a roommate she says that 

456.83 463.20 B: oregon 

457.41 459.24 A: oregon yeah [laugh] 

459.34 460.39 A: [breath] [breath] 

463.73 465.53 B: at least near california if not 

465.76 466.35 A: right 

465.84 467.93 B: in california but i don't really know 

468.13 471.15 B: you know if those are very small companies or if they're hiring but um 

471.37 473.05 B: i figure you know i i 

473.20 476.60 B: came home from d._c. because i didn't want to be that far from home anymore so 

476.94 480.88 B: i decided that i don't want to go west for a job that may or may not exist 

481.10 481.75 A: right 

481.83 482.89 B: but um i 

482.99 485.06 B: you know it's funny because i wasn't really 

485.26 486.13 B: at the time 

486.38 490.59 B: thinking of going into applied linguistics but now i'm teaching e._s._l. part time 

490.42 492.16 A: oh you are oh that's great 

491.30 491.71 B: and 

491.87 492.85 B: and i tr- i 

492.96 493.45 B: the only 

493.54 496.69 B: people that talk to me like job wise are in teaching fields 

495.45 495.74 A: mhm 

496.81 497.39 A: right 

497.31 503.47 B: and so i'm like oh my god if i did applied linguistics and i didn't do applied because i thought you know maybe i'd make money if i did computers 

503.56 504.15 A: right 

503.98 507.91 B: only the jobs that i'm missing now because i don't have certification or 

508.31 514.01 B: things that i would have got with applied linguistics so i'm kind of kicking myself now for not doing applied. 

513.87 517.26 A: that's hugely ironic and strange and really surprising 

515.18 515.70 B: yeah 

516.83 519.00 B: yes and at at the time i really like 

519.42 522.24 B: you know georgetown had a sociolinguistics applied 

522.44 522.95 B: um 

522.47 522.89 A: right 

523.12 528.95 B: computational and theoretical and theoretical was just more of the same so i'm like i'm not staying for a p._h._d. so i'm not going to do that 

529.03 529.44 A: right 

529.25 531.83 B: socio i'm like that's even worse off job wise 

532.04 532.48 A: right 

532.14 534.18 B: and applied my parents are both teachers and i'm like 

534.28 536.37 B: you know they kept telling me don't be a teacher don't be a teacher 

536.18 537.26 A: [breath] [laugh] 

536.67 539.38 B: so i'm like okay i won't be a teacher and it wasn't really like 

539.69 540.61 B: something that i was 

540.82 542.45 B: that interested in but now i'm like 

542.70 543.19 B: teaching's 

543.59 546.75 B: seems great and (( )) doesn't go bad with the economy 

546.85 547.59 A: exactly 

547.80 549.07 B: (( )) a lot of immigrants 

547.86 548.56 A: exactly 

549.32 549.89 A: right 

549.35 549.94 B: you know 

550.06 550.70 B: and ah 

550.15 550.54 A: right 

550.97 555.02 B: so now i'm like you know what you know if i did ah the fifth year applied i probably could have done it 

555.25 555.86 B: for free 

555.98 557.47 B: and i instead i paid 

557.68 560.17 B: [laugh] like more loans 

559.87 560.69 A: wow 

560.31 561.96 B: so (( )) so 

562.18 565.32 B: you know congratulations that you picked probably the good field 

565.57 565.98 B: [breath] 

573.72 579.48 B: i tr- you know they kind of threw it in last minute as like the fifth year so i took 

576.45 576.78 A: uh-huh 

577.45 577.89 A: uh-huh 

579.84 582.51 B: a perl and i did c. plus plus over the summer 

582.49 582.86 A: uh-huh 

582.99 583.95 B: um but 

584.13 588.83 B: i'm not a programmer but i mean i i worked more kind of with programming more than 

589.00 589.54 B: actually 

589.95 590.94 B: you know like we um 

591.35 593.53 B: we learned more like how it would work and then 

593.69 595.92 B: made very small programs and we pretty much 

596.01 596.77 B: sucked at them 

596.83 601.09 A: uh-huh [laugh] because you're linguists not computer people right yeah 

597.40 598.73 B: so 

599.28 599.89 B: yes 

600.43 603.68 B: yes and it's you know i'm pretty good with computers it's just that i 

604.07 605.36 B: totally didn't learn them 

605.83 609.46 B: we we didn't go about learning them the right way at the last minute they kind of said oh and 

609.63 614.96 B: you know you should be able to do this with the program and we were like well you didn't teach us basic programming so how could we possibly 

615.43 618.38 B: you know so i i took a summer course in c. plus plus and 

618.56 618.96 A: mhm 

618.67 619.79 B: you know what i could tell that 

620.00 622.00 B: in the summer ah community college 

622.38 624.17 B: they way they taught it was so much better 

624.33 625.83 B: than at georgetown when they just kind of 

626.21 627.05 A: wow 

626.23 627.10 B: threw it at us 

627.41 627.97 A: wow 

627.49 629.81 B: so it's like they didn't really give us a fighting chance 

629.95 632.13 B: to to learn compu- to learn programming 

632.29 632.81 A: wow 

632.34 635.97 B: so if i was really a programmer and knew a little bit of language i'd be better off
