48.14 50.25 A: and that's the only reason i like holidays like 

50.64 52.33 A: christmas and easter and everything because 

52.44 53.70 A: i actually grew up catholic 

54.23 59.44 A: so it's like you know we don't think (( )) we're kind of the same way we 

59.74 64.17 A: um we don't really think at all about jesus or anything we just 

64.40 69.63 A: think about getting together and eating lots of food and getting lots of candy and giving presents 

70.14 70.93 A: and um 

71.08 73.39 A: i was just thinking the other day about easter 

73.66 74.71 A: it's like nobody 

74.84 76.20 A: really cares about 

76.54 78.95 A: what the meaning of easter is we just care about getting 

79.23 81.51 A: stuff from the easter bunny 

81.32 88.00 B: yeah from from what i understand easter is kind of maybe even like a bigger deal than christmas in terms of you know religious significance 

88.08 92.61 A: yeah for for people who are really strict catholics and i don't know about 

88.24 88.64 B: you know (( )) 

92.76 94.27 A: any of the other um 

94.38 95.99 A: christian denominations but 

96.37 97.09 A: yeah i think that's 

97.69 101.47 A: a really important one i think in a lot of places in europe it's celebrated 

101.77 107.75 A: it like goes on for an entire week well i mean first there's lent which is forty days and then easter itself goes on for an entire week and 

108.12 109.61 A: it's all you know really 

110.17 110.72 A: um 

111.30 112.86 A: really in depth and 

113.27 117.60 A: they go to a lot of different masses and everything but nope not here 

117.85 122.03 B: yeah i mean i actually i really like the idea of christmas too like not not for the whole 

118.33 118.60 A: oh 

122.17 122.55 B: you know 

122.70 124.18 B: jesus stuff but uh 

124.72 130.77 B: i just like the i like all the songs alike you know music that's going on and the whole idea of good will and cheer 

128.01 128.48 A: uh-huh 

130.93 131.48 B: going on 

130.94 131.46 A: yeah 

131.75 132.20 A: yeah 

131.76 137.33 B: everywhere it's kind of nice there's like all t._v. shows are like special and happy and everybody is you know nobody is mean 

137.51 138.68 A: yeah 

138.83 142.03 A: i like um have you i don't know if you have cable or not 

142.13 142.51 A: but 

142.84 146.54 A: i've i recently got cable because i just was too bored 

146.66 153.56 A: so i got cable and i've been watching the family channel it's like the fox or the a._b._c. family channel stuff and they dug out all these 

152.27 152.72 B: right 

153.66 156.63 A: old old old christmas specials from the sixties 

156.75 160.68 A: and i mean this stuff is like really old like when they first started doing claymation 

160.89 161.35 B: right 

161.04 163.13 A: and like this really weird animation 

163.42 172.42 A: and it's just like it's so funny to watch them because it's like what you're talking about the whole christmas spirit and everything except it's really really dorky 

172.08 172.69 B: right 

172.59 180.05 A: and the you know there's one with like leprechans and i didn't really understand what they were doing but they were trying to find gold for christmas it was 

180.82 186.40 A: it was totally weird like it didn't really fit in because they were looking for gold but then they you know 

186.88 191.36 A: i don't know they beat some witch and it was christmas and they found the gold and 

191.55 192.32 B: right 

191.60 194.90 A: yeah if you have that channel then you should look into that 

195.24 199.51 B: i actually i don't have cable right now i don't e- i don't even really have regular t._v. 

199.51 199.96 A: uh-huh 

199.70 201.23 B: because i i live uh 

201.41 203.98 B: i'm a college student and my college doesn't have 

204.10 204.43 B: like 

204.60 206.93 B: i don't even have reception in my room and they don't let us get cable 

207.14 208.05 A: that's horrible 

208.30 208.63 B: yep 

209.16 215.48 A: oh my god when i was in um when i was in school they had we could get cable in our rooms 

215.74 217.76 A: and actually i don't think it was that expensive either 

218.47 220.94 A: but it was only just like one specific package you couldn't just 

221.05 221.33 A: get 

221.58 222.93 A: any old package you wanted 

223.21 223.58 B: right 

223.66 227.98 A: okay anyway back to (( )) the topic back to holidays um if you could 

225.70 225.97 B: yeah 

228.35 230.08 A: invent a holiday yeah 

228.52 229.37 B: make a holiday 

231.23 231.82 B: um 

232.21 234.93 B: i don't guess i'd i'd first say like i 

235.16 235.68 B: wouldn't 

235.78 236.84 B: you know i 

236.94 239.33 B: i don't really want to invent a holiday like i don't think 

239.94 244.21 A: people invent holidays all the time that's what (( )) day is right 

240.06 240.71 B: and i think 

242.37 242.84 B: yeah 

244.39 244.99 B: right 

244.41 245.26 A: and uh 

245.67 246.22 B: i mean 

246.29 247.22 A: other holidays 

246.48 246.79 B: like 

247.65 249.11 B: we've got you know like i don't know 

249.33 255.71 B: all the holidays seem to have like some kind of you know commercial aspect to them so i would want like some sort of non-commercial holiday 

253.09 253.55 A: right 

256.01 261.00 B: like where but that be impossible because i mean whatever holiday you have they're going to make cards and they're going to 

260.74 261.22 A: uh-huh 

261.36 268.04 B: know make money and gifts and chocolates and flowers or whatever it is you know buy your mother something you know 

267.69 268.17 A: uh-huh 

268.23 269.76 B: buy some fireworks i don't know 

270.29 271.74 B: um so 

272.19 277.14 B: i don't know some kind of like jehova's witness day you know where you don't have to do anything and you're not allowed to and 

278.08 278.58 A: i think 

278.14 278.78 B: not a 

279.24 279.84 B: yeah 

279.24 289.49 A: i think i would do like you know the holidays that we have that nobody ever celebrates except for the fact that we get off of school and work like president's day and martin luther king day and everything 

285.44 286.02 B: right 

289.52 289.99 B: right 

289.68 291.00 A: i think that we should have 

291.39 294.63 A: um some day like susan b. anthony day 

295.15 299.59 A: you know n- nobody celebrates you know the importance of 

300.11 304.21 A: what women did for the country you know or suffragette day or something like that 

304.53 308.70 A: where we could celebrate you know women getting the vote or something like that 

308.84 312.55 A: i'm i'm a feminist so i would have to make like some sort of feminist holiday 

308.95 309.48 B: sounds good 

312.77 322.24 A: but it just seems like we have martin luther king day and that's good except that you know lots of people don't care and we have president's day for lincoln and for washington 

313.46 314.07 B: okay 

319.35 319.63 B: yeah 

322.89 325.76 A: and uh what else we have veteran's day and 

326.13 329.07 A: labor day and we should have someday for it's like 

326.26 326.66 B: yeah 

329.50 331.35 A: some day for women that's not mother's day 

331.51 333.92 B: or sadie hawkins day you know where they do that whole 

331.55 332.32 A: basically 

333.25 334.01 A: there's what day 

334.13 337.35 B: sadie hawkins day sometimes like they have like dances at schools 

337.46 338.16 A: oh really 

337.71 338.08 B: where 

338.53 343.26 B: sadie hawkins was like i don't know sadie hawkins was like a dance where like a girl was supposed to ask a guy 

343.22 344.23 A: oh yeah uh-huh 

343.79 346.66 B: uh (( like you know )) like hey it's backwards because that's when (( )) 

345.98 347.98 A: it was sadie hawkins a real person 

348.18 350.05 B: i i assume i mean i don't know (( )) 

349.35 350.48 A: okay 

350.22 351.56 B: why they'd make that up 

351.01 352.04 A: uh 

351.72 352.41 B: but uh 

353.35 354.19 B: yeah so 

354.98 361.82 B: uh some sort of feminist and m- most most holidays people don't really care about the actual significance anyway like labor day like we celebrate 

361.35 361.84 A: yeah 

361.95 365.64 B: you know working i mean what is labor day i don't even know what's it's supposed to commemorate like 

365.68 366.00 A: it's 

365.84 368.33 B: we're workers so let's not go to school you know let's not 

366.81 367.45 A: yeah 

367.68 369.29 A: e- exactly that's what it is 

368.93 369.30 B: (( were )) 

370.27 378.22 B: it should be non-labor day and like memorial day yeah yeah i mean m- what is memorial day i don't actually remember like i don't actually sit down 

371.95 373.68 A: arbor day 

382.36 387.63 A: it's similar to veteran's day except it's for the ones who died in war it's for the people who have died in war 

388.31 389.74 B: day is for those who are alive 

389.86 392.42 A: yeah and veteran's day is for veteran's 

392.89 394.71 A: yeah because you have to be alive to be a veteran 

395.04 395.52 B: okay 

395.90 396.28 A: yep 

396.66 398.28 B: when you die you stop being a veteran 

398.37 399.04 A: exactly 

399.69 408.08 A: no no no if you if you die in war you stop being a vet- well no if you die in war you you never become a veteran because a veteran actually means that you went to war and you came back 

403.09 403.94 B: oh okay 

408.36 409.05 B: understood 

409.22 409.80 A: okay 

410.01 411.32 B: so do you know how long we've been talking 

410.69 411.33 A: maybe they 

411.53 411.99 A: what 

412.24 413.31 B: do you know how long we've been talking 

413.69 415.23 A: i don't know uh is it going to tell us 

415.75 416.69 B: i would assume 

416.69 417.16 A: okay 

417.35 419.04 B: they were pretty good about starting us off 

419.16 419.62 A: yeah 

420.11 420.84 B: but uh 

421.23 421.83 A: um 

422.20 424.70 A: i was going to say maybe we should have a day to 

425.01 427.48 A: commemorate all the civilians who have been killed in war 

428.08 429.97 A: nobody seems to care about them 

430.35 431.34 B: there's uh 

432.23 436.16 B: uh at my i work at a camp over over the summers and it's uh 

436.79 439.08 B: we do we do this hiroshima night thing 

439.23 440.33 A: oh really uh-huh 

439.38 440.64 B: where yeah 

441.37 442.20 B: um 

442.91 445.32 B: where on like august sixth or seventh or 

445.84 446.51 B: something 

446.87 451.19 B: uh whenever it actually was like we light candles and like make paper planes 

450.85 451.95 A: oh wow uh-huh 

452.31 453.91 B: and we do like sort of 

454.21 455.07 B: commemorate 

455.33 457.25 B: that in our little way 

457.36 457.86 A: mhm 

458.13 459.29 B: and uh 

458.37 461.19 A: well it we just passed up um pearl harbor day 

463.28 463.71 B: that's e- 

468.55 471.60 A: and nobody said or did anything about that either but 

471.89 476.14 A: in the past few years it seemed like people were getting more interested in that maybe that was because there was a movie though 

473.04 474.26 B: oh yeah yeah 

476.55 477.01 B: right 

476.59 478.81 A: i don't know but this year nobody cared 

480.93 481.48 A: oh 

481.17 481.61 B: so 

483.02 487.86 A: we're too busy with the the war on terrorism pretty soon we're going to have a day for that too 

487.63 488.13 B: right 

488.14 489.74 A: a holiday 

489.99 491.56 A: against terror 

493.16 497.48 B: but yeah i i wonder what's going to happen i mean what's going to happen to september eleventh you know in the future you know 

496.97 500.12 A: oh yeah if it's going to become it's own sort of memorial 

500.57 501.22 A: holiday 

502.05 502.58 B: exactly 

502.75 503.58 A: i don't know 

504.37 506.67 A: i think i was wondering about that earlier but it just 

507.28 507.81 A: you know 

508.30 510.27 A: i guess it's just too soon now 

511.37 512.93 A: even though it's been over a year 

513.05 514.17 A: you know people still 

513.76 514.18 B: oh yeah 

514.67 516.49 A: get upset talking about it and everything 

517.00 518.78 B: yeah i mean we'll see what happens like 

517.32 517.65 A: but 

519.21 523.22 B: i mean g- it'll be something probably like you know like pearl harbor day i mean eventually 

522.73 523.17 A: mhm 

523.51 523.96 A: yeah 

525.05 526.22 B: there's uh 

526.74 529.64 B: i've actually i read like they have a comic book like commemorating 

529.92 530.63 B: uh 

531.26 531.61 B: like 

531.82 537.33 B: you know like it was like a spiderman where it was all about how september eleventh and like the effects in that it had in the comic book world 

537.38 538.12 A: oh really 

537.71 542.76 B: and the made comparisons to yeah i mean it was pretty it was really like nicely done it was very 

542.87 546.36 B: like heart felt and serious and like you know as good as anything else that i've any other 

546.72 548.16 B: memorial type thing that i saw 

548.84 549.58 B: on that subject 

550.22 556.06 B: um and they compared there was comparisons because like in the comic world there were like people who around were around for both things and like heroes 

556.12 557.15 A: oh wow uh-huh 

557.13 558.82 B: so they were they drew similarities 

559.76 560.25 A: yeah 

559.80 560.43 B: so
