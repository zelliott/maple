172.20 173.31 B: whole situation just 

173.81 178.47 B: i'm kind of like i guess another reason i don't really pay attention to it is because i don't like to think about it 

178.66 179.28 A: uh-huh 

179.30 180.14 B: like i just don't 

180.33 182.13 B: i'd know it just kind of scares me

200.78 201.20 B: right 

202.57 204.25 A: things like that happen i guess 

205.41 206.77 B: can only imagine that's just 

207.64 208.41 B: i don't know 

208.77 210.09 B: i'm like the dessert 

210.25 211.81 B: storm and that's about it

220.06 220.81 B: i don't know 

221.13 223.36 B: i know i don't trust him so i think i- 

223.48 224.64 B: highly possible 

228.53 230.52 A: i have a hard time understanding 

230.86 231.45 A: the 

231.64 234.55 A: the thinking behind what goes on and 

234.93 237.84 A: some of those other countries and dictatorships 

236.54 236.97 B: right 

237.95 243.11 A: since i've never been much of a power grabber myself i don't really understand

321.18 322.44 A: in kansas we have

331.63 332.18 A: mhm

338.43 340.24 B: champaign is just so flat 

340.06 340.81 A: yeah

341.61 343.41 B: a lot of different though we don't have a lot of you know uh 

344.34 345.29 A: huh 

344.97 346.31 B: yeah i'm home so

394.49 395.28 A: yeah 

395.17 397.55 B: i haven't done to many of these yet so i'm not really su- 

395.42 396.02 A: (( )) 

397.71 398.70 B: familiar with it yet 

398.98 400.46 A: yea um i know that 

400.66 403.97 A: if we keep talking sooner or later they will cut us off 

405.56 407.34 A: i guess we need talking so the get a- 

408.78 409.45 A: full tape 

409.69 410.27 B: right 

410.78 411.99 B: i'm just like i don't 

412.35 414.73 B: know how this is actually going to be valid because i'm 

414.95 415.40 B: ignorant 

417.16 419.24 A: mhm well don't feel bad uh 

419.59 422.29 A: another lady and i tried to talk about uh 

422.51 427.33 A: what was it reality based t._v. shows and neither one of us new anything about that either 

427.20 427.53 B: oh 

427.71 429.86 B: i would have been okay with that 

429.66 430.47 A: oh 

430.62 432.26 A: well 

431.65 433.21 B: little bit better than this one any way 

432.78 434.97 A: yeah 

434.80 435.92 B: survivor and all that 

436.82 437.51 A: huh 

440.37 443.39 A: so you actually fine time to watch t._v. when you're going to school 

443.46 445.75 B: not very much that's why i probably wouldn't 

445.98 449.11 B: i mean there's specific shows i like to watch but other than that 

448.32 448.75 A: uh-huh 

449.32 449.76 B: um 

450.18 452.39 B: just like friends of dawson's creek or what ever 

452.70 453.27 A: yeah 

452.79 455.09 B: but i don't have a lot of free time to do that 

455.31 455.86 A: mhm 

456.02 458.32 B: try to stay away from it to cause i'm like aw i'll g- 

458.50 460.30 B: distracted and not do what i'm supposed to do 

460.09 463.28 A: yeah t._v. has a way of sucking you in 

462.63 463.01 B: yeah 

463.51 466.31 A: when i was going to college the first time 

466.71 468.93 A: and that was when star trek was new 

469.05 470.20 B: oh 

470.00 475.59 A: and so every one in my hall would gather around the t._v. when star trek came on 

475.98 476.52 B: hum 

476.59 477.75 A: (( )) 

478.36 479.15 A: probably (( )) 

479.44 482.38 A: major show that i would watch i wouldn't watch much of anything else 

482.68 483.32 B: yeah 

482.70 484.91 A: because like you i was very busy trying to 

485.12 489.09 A: keep my head above water and pass my courses 

488.07 488.43 B: yup 

490.33 490.98 B: i'm just 

491.21 493.21 B: we start finals next week so 

493.16 493.96 A: oh 

493.86 494.71 B: hopefully it'll 

495.20 498.04 B: go by quickly i'm just ready for this semester to be over 

498.45 501.11 B: last five speech and hearing classes and 

500.99 501.47 A: mhm 

501.47 504.71 B: next week or next semesters going to be a lot different so 

504.88 505.26 A: mhm 

505.49 508.55 B: have a lot more free time and enjoy the rest of my senior year so 

508.33 509.86 A: yeah uh that'll be good 

509.32 509.86 B: (( )) 

511.32 512.67 B: go for a grad school anyway 

511.48 511.84 A: i 

512.65 514.02 A: (( )) i uh 

514.35 515.63 A: i could have had 

515.99 521.72 A: uh uh reason to use a speech pathologist because my first some was born with a cleft lip and palate 

521.89 522.52 B: oh really 

522.75 524.69 A: and those kids often 

525.87 526.21 B: right 

527.84 528.34 B: nasal 

528.16 529.78 A: but um 

530.06 533.83 A: luckily after his surgery he could speak just normally so 

534.14 534.80 B: god tha- 

535.09 536.14 B: good to here 

535.75 536.76 A: yeah 

536.90 537.38 B: sometim- 

536.90 540.87 A: in fact uh the speech pathologist brought him in and had him talk and 

541.13 545.06 A: be recorded and stuff so they could figure out what he was doing right 

544.66 545.07 B: mhm 

546.06 548.25 A: never heard any more from it but it was kind of 

549.28 550.96 A: kind of an honor i guess 

550.82 551.34 B: yeah 

551.83 552.18 B: right 

552.50 553.08 A: yeah 

552.93 554.79 B: you don't a lot of times you here 

555.28 556.75 B: continues problems so 

556.75 557.22 A: mhm 

557.23 558.35 B: it's really good to hear that 

558.62 559.32 A: yeah i 

559.60 565.26 A: i have a friend who's probably in fifties if not in his sixties and he has trouble i- 

565.46 573.00 A: (( )) closing off his air ways so it's a struggle to understand him plus he's speaking french too 

573.59 574.14 B: yeah 

574.04 577.26 A: but fortunately patient person 

577.14 579.70 B: see and that's interesting to me cause you talking about like 

580.17 583.08 B: you know second language and every thing and we have to deal with that too 

583.41 583.87 A: mhm 

583.42 584.48 B: for people that aren't 

584.61 588.33 B: primarily english speakers we have to know you know the different dialects and 

588.55 589.09 A: yeah 

588.77 591.03 B: so we don't end up diagnosing the wrong 

590.83 592.35 A: right 

591.85 594.07 B: (( )) pronouncing something you know of their 

594.61 596.30 B: french decent or you know 

596.35 597.20 A: exactly 

596.54 598.27 B: that's really interesting to me 

598.15 603.74 A: yeah cause the french speakers don't have a clue about how to pronounce the t._h. sound 

603.64 604.15 B: uh-huh 

604.24 604.51 B: there's 

604.69 605.19 B: defiantly 

605.75 607.28 B: certain sounds or even like um 

608.16 610.87 B: ebonics and such 

609.61 610.58 A: mhm 

611.29 612.22 B: diagnosed as a- 

612.68 613.15 B: thing 

613.35 616.76 B: you know wrong or having a disorder when really that's just the way 

616.95 618.38 B: dialect and such so 

618.46 619.24 A: yeah 

619.50 619.99 B: yeah 

620.70 621.70 A: true 

623.35 623.82 A: yup 

624.20 632.50 A: and then another thing i struggle with my students is when to pronouns the h. and when not to since the 

632.73 635.80 A: the can pronouns the h. okay they just can't figure out 

635.89 637.72 A: when to do it 

637.00 637.46 B: mhm 

639.89 640.61 A: so 

640.13 640.95 B: see i've never been 

641.05 642.05 B: exposed to french just 

642.15 642.74 B: spanish 

643.01 643.42 A: hum 

643.81 644.28 B: so 

645.35 647.02 B: our school i come from a really small 

647.11 647.51 B: school 

648.22 649.34 B: and uh we had 

649.61 651.33 B: french and italian and that- 

651.86 652.38 B: the basics 

653.35 655.06 B: two languages we had as i grew 

655.55 656.77 B: and your normal english but 

657.63 658.56 B: that'd be neat they 

659.20 660.30 B: offer that here but 

662.24 662.62 A: hm 

664.63 667.21 A: oh where did you live that they were teaching italian 

668.42 668.90 B: um 

670.18 670.79 B: in (( ana )) 

670.92 671.51 B: jonesbrough 

672.08 672.92 B: which is 

673.41 675.22 B: they kind of taught it as a 

676.10 679.50 B: intro class in the junior high is not just little things 

679.79 680.36 A: mhm 

680.01 681.23 B: but the main thing that they 

681.43 682.60 B: taught was spanish 

682.72 683.25 A: uh-huh 

683.63 684.83 B: that wasn't really 

685.28 687.20 B: a lot in italian i never took it 

687.55 687.97 A: mhm 

688.59 689.33 B: so and i think 

689.71 691.60 B: not sure if they had french or not bu- 

691.76 692.63 B: if they did it was 

693.41 693.82 B: only 

694.03 695.31 B: maybe three or four students 

695.96 698.07 B: i know in high school the teacher that taught 

696.07 696.51 A: oh 

698.39 699.52 B: spanish we ha two of them 

699.66 701.22 B: and one of them was able to 

701.41 703.05 B: beat both spanish and french
