56.67 62.25 B: living up to your expectations and you're not telling us but we're not giving anybody proof that really concerns me 

60.60 61.16 A: right 

62.64 63.16 A: yeah 

63.19 63.88 B: um 

64.77 65.74 B: i don't 

65.95 67.44 B: believe that 

68.96 70.11 B: we will nece- 

70.22 71.00 B: -ssarily 

73.00 74.76 B: get the information 

75.09 77.52 B: all the information from the arms inspectors on the ground 

77.87 78.37 A: sure 

78.36 81.72 B: tell me tell me what (( )) not i'm not too well versed in this 

78.50 78.88 A: yeah 

80.11 81.65 A: (( yo )) yeah no i 

81.80 92.02 A: no no i totally agree i think i mean i think that my conflict is just that it's such a double standard because we think it's okay that we have ma- weapons of mass destruction and that 

91.95 92.29 B: mhm 

94.10 94.51 B: mhm 

98.76 99.45 A: -struction and we 

99.56 107.10 A: chosen iraq as one that doesn't and i just i don't know i'm just not clear about why we chose iraq versus any other country 

107.57 110.56 A: as one that's not worthy of having weapons of mass destruction 

110.93 112.52 B: i think i i 

113.88 116.48 B: (( )) think it's maybe it's earlier this year 

117.17 120.42 B: that i read an article in the new yorker and it was about 

120.98 121.73 B: i don't know if you 

121.90 125.76 B: read about this or heard about it um using poison gas on the kurds 

126.05 126.62 A: right 

126.71 127.09 B: which was 

126.76 127.16 A: right 

127.30 128.56 B: absolutely 

128.91 129.79 B: terrifying 

130.14 130.60 A: mhm 

130.70 131.44 B: and 

131.80 132.86 B: so i think 

133.88 136.08 B: you know i i would hope that 

137.52 140.15 B: if we god forbid ever used nuclear weapons 

140.35 140.82 A: right 

140.81 141.79 B: it would be 

142.06 144.73 B: in a worse case scenario um 

144.84 147.85 B: i i don't know self-defense whatever i don't i mean i don't believe in it 

147.91 148.26 A: right 

148.19 149.15 B: but there there 

149.30 152.16 B: does seem to be a more evil intent 

152.45 153.96 B: by this leader in iraq 

152.63 152.89 A: sure 

154.74 160.66 A: sure but i i feel like you know we've seen like some of the same sorts of things with like the tutsis in the 

155.13 155.70 B: um 

161.04 162.32 A: you know and the 

163.35 163.75 A: in 

164.04 168.17 A: and i just feel like we've seen this kind of thing in other parts of the world and we kind of 

167.31 170.14 B: what what is this thing with the tutsis cause i don't don't know about that 

169.32 175.51 A: well what like with the tutsis and the (( )) i think there was a whole lot of genocide going on and people weren't even using weapons of mass destruction they were just 

175.64 182.83 A: so whopping ea- each others heads off or shooting each other with guns and we saw all this genocide that was going on and we didn't do anything about it 

183.00 192.30 A: you know and and yet when the genocide is happening to the kurds not that it's not horrible it is but i'm just i'm concerned about the way that we 

183.05 183.41 B: mhm 

183.68 184.08 B: right 

184.28 184.95 B: if it were (( )) 

188.89 189.29 B: right 

192.60 193.87 A: sort of choose which 

194.46 196.54 A: eh- episodes of genocide we're going to get 

196.27 196.58 B: right 

196.64 198.66 A: we're going to get concerned about you know 

198.12 198.54 B: right 

198.72 200.91 B: right right you should be concerned about all of it 

199.03 200.32 A: i mean it seems like 

201.27 201.79 B: or none of it 

201.41 202.00 A: right 

201.95 202.71 B: so 

202.12 210.12 A: right it seems like we should we should be if we're going to be a world police we need to be you know a fair world police and say okay well we're going to put people you know 

207.27 207.59 B: right 

209.13 209.97 B: i i 

210.25 218.36 A: on the ground in sierra leone and we're going to put people on the ground in congo and we're going to put people on the ground everywhere but you know obviously we can't over commit our troops and so i think 

214.03 214.28 B: yep 

214.92 215.23 B: yep 

218.72 223.95 A: i mean it feels to me like you know we're we're driven to do something about iraq because of oil 

224.07 224.51 B: mhm 

224.24 225.34 A: you know and 

225.76 228.34 A: i don't know it just it just seems so 

229.09 231.29 A: strange like bush doesn't even want 

240.27 240.52 B: right 

240.39 243.81 A: (( )) he wants an excuse to go to war and finish his father's job you know 

243.25 243.67 B: right 

243.95 245.41 B: well i'm just curious 

245.54 249.82 B: i mean i i guess i'm i'm a little pollyannaish and i i try to 

251.38 259.75 B: huh believe that we're doing the right thing and and i think that's based out of naivete for my part it's easier for me to see the world through rose colored glasses 

254.23 255.02 A: sure 

257.29 260.02 A: no no i don't think so at all i mean i think i think 

260.21 266.67 A: i think helping the kurds is a great idea you know i mean i i think that stopping at least stopping one form of genocide is 

266.84 268.01 A: is certainly honorable 

267.48 267.86 B: right 

267.98 270.57 B: but but the question i'm i'm curious is do we have proof 

271.01 271.36 A: right 

271.41 277.08 B: i mean and if we have proof then i eh i'm a little bit more able to deal with it if we don't have proof then i like 

278.11 279.06 B: uh 

278.34 284.87 A: right and do and and is it proof that they have weapons of mass destruction or proof that they're going to use them in the way that they said they would or 

284.50 285.10 B: yeah 

285.53 294.49 A: you know and like who gave them those weapons well we gave you know cause i have i have an iranian student who was in my class and he said let me tell you if iraq's got weapons of mass destruction i'll tell you who gave them to them 

294.37 294.76 B: we did 

294.94 296.48 B: now when when was that that we did that 

295.91 296.44 A: right 

297.03 297.39 B: was that 

297.06 307.53 A: and it well well it was it during the iran iraq war and we decided that we wanted that we would rather side with iraq and so like a lot of um a lot of the anthrax type stuff um 

304.23 305.09 B: that's incredible 

307.07 307.51 B: okay 

307.88 308.30 B: mhm 

308.26 311.71 A: apparently you know according to this student now obviously he's biased because 

312.09 317.94 A: you know he feels like okay (( )) right yeah he's from iran and he said you guys gave the other guy some 

312.62 313.27 B: he's from iran 

314.67 315.23 B: yeah 

318.07 319.51 A: pretty nasty stuff 

319.06 319.49 B: yeah 

319.80 328.49 A: um but you know it was i guess it was right after september eleventh and people were getting really concerned about anthrax attacks in the u._s. and that they were being perpetrated perhaps by people in iraq and 

325.20 325.61 B: uh-huh 

328.92 330.99 A: that's sort of what he said was well 

331.90 333.52 A: you know if if saddam has it 

333.68 337.31 A: then i have a couple good guesses as to where he got it now obviously it it it 

337.65 339.73 A: he wasn't just placing blame on the u._s. but 

340.16 341.64 A: you know he said it just seems like 

342.00 345.63 A: whatever government is going to do your bidding is the government that you stand behind 

345.72 346.19 B: right 

346.49 346.90 B: right 

346.72 351.70 A: no matter how oppressive it seems to be or whatever cause we didn't give a crap about the taliban until 

352.33 352.84 A: you know 

352.40 352.74 B: right 

353.22 353.60 B: right 

353.59 354.41 A: the whole the whole 

354.53 355.11 A: crisis of 

355.25 359.91 A: what you know with the twin towers happened and you know they wouldn't turn over osama bin laden so it's just 

356.21 356.53 B: yeah 

357.53 357.92 B: right 

360.12 362.56 A: i don't know i think i'm too jaded 

361.70 363.00 B: you're too jaded 

363.39 366.85 B: well i always just feel i feel ignorant i mean because i don't 

367.00 368.52 B: i you know i i 

369.19 373.76 B: follow current events just to a small extent so i feel like there's so much i don't know 

374.45 377.19 A: well sure and well and i feel like i get such a one sided 

374.62 374.96 B: (( )) 

377.40 382.94 A: view because uh you know there are stations i refuse to watch because i think their coverage is too conservative like fox news i just don't even think it's news 

383.30 385.48 B: (( )) what part of the country are you in i'm just curious 

383.47 384.41 A: you know and 

385.60 388.25 A: i'm in the east on the east coast i'm in pennsylvania 

386.76 387.26 B: oh okay 

387.76 388.21 B: oh okay 

388.51 394.36 A: um so it's kind of interesting cause i'm sort of in an enclave that's pretty liberal but it's surrounded by really conservative 

388.52 388.85 B: yeah 

394.37 394.80 B: mhm 

394.82 396.93 A: um sort of agricultural based 

394.96 395.34 B: mhm 

397.16 398.25 A: economy 

397.82 398.89 B: uh-huh uh-huh 

398.53 401.17 A: and so you know like a lot of folks around here 

401.47 403.62 A: you know rely on fox news and that to them is 

403.82 404.28 A: you know 

404.55 407.36 A: that's news and that what i listen to n._p._r. is 

407.72 411.21 A: you know just natio- well i think they call it n._p._l._r. national public liberal radio 

409.65 411.00 B: yeah yeah no we have that too 

411.59 413.79 A: so i just you know i think that that 

411.75 412.24 B: yeah 

414.19 415.96 A: that plays a part because i feel like oh well 

416.72 418.82 A: i'm biased because i get my news from 

419.11 421.49 A: n._p._r. and i know their slant and i know there 

421.29 421.59 B: right 

421.76 422.12 B: right 

422.49 422.74 A: dig 

423.08 423.45 B: right 

423.52 429.24 A: so i feel like i i automatically won't give anything a chance if it's something that i knew came from bush or that came from 

423.92 424.70 B: yeah and i i 

429.14 430.24 B: right oh yeah yeah 

429.41 430.67 A: fox news or whatever 

430.86 431.22 B: yeah 

431.55 431.88 B: yeah 

432.35 432.93 A: so 

433.05 433.69 B: um 

434.53 439.46 A: that's really frustrating too that you know i feel like eh it's so hard to have a conversation about it with 

439.69 441.06 A: people who don't agree because 

441.90 445.87 A: we we don't even start with the same things as facts you know we just start with 

445.30 448.72 B: well there's so many i i just feel like there's so many facts out there that i don't know 

448.74 449.99 A: sure oh yeah 

448.86 453.17 B: and so i come out with these sort of half opinions and i'm you know i'm clearly uh 

454.04 454.58 B: uh 

454.27 456.08 A: but i i think that's that's kind of 

457.06 457.48 A: the 

458.30 462.21 A: a characteristic of the age i don't think anybody ever feels like they have enough information 

462.30 462.78 B: mhm 

462.40 463.74 A: you know that's why we have 

463.98 466.42 A: five things going on on c._n._n. right now 

466.80 469.73 A: like it was just amazing they went to this new format where i was like 

469.14 470.68 B: there five things meaning what 

474.34 476.35 B: oh doing that kind of stuff yeah 

477.46 482.15 A: and in another corner you have headlines but then there's also a pers- an anchor who's actually on all the time 

479.33 480.10 B: okay 

482.44 484.78 A: giving you a story so it's like these five 

482.99 483.58 B: oh really 

485.17 487.18 A: things that you're trying to pay attention to 

487.65 490.69 A: at the same time and i'm thinking whose idea was this 

487.84 488.46 B: yeah 

490.80 491.12 B: right 

490.85 494.09 A: how have we gotten to a point where we needed this much information 

493.90 494.33 B: uh-huh 

494.62 501.50 B: well this is the ki- the kids who do their homework and play video games and talk to their friends on the phone it's that kind of thing 

498.87 501.06 A: right sure yeah 

501.96 510.44 B: yes exact- i don't i don't watch t._v. so i just get i get free n._p._r. and the little bits and pieces of the newspaper the new yorker but it's just bits and pieces 

501.98 502.79 A: yeah 

510.70 512.27 A: right right are you in new york 

511.23 511.79 B: um 

512.46 514.17 B: i'm in uh boston 

514.35 515.18 A: yeah okay 

515.54 524.76 A: yeah i mean it's just it's so strange i went on the internet today to just find out what's going on in my home town i'm from charlotte north carolina they had a big ice storm there last week and my parents were without power for 

525.04 526.31 A: you know a couple days and stuff 

527.09 532.13 A: and i i knew that that was going on from the radio and stuff but i had no idea the extent to which 

532.82 535.31 A: you know this ice storm devastated my town i mean the cl- 

535.56 537.69 A: the schools are still closed they've been closed a week 

536.41 536.94 B: yeah 

537.79 542.99 A: people are dying because they're trying to run generators in their house or use charcoal to keep their houses warm 

540.86 541.27 B: mhm 

543.56 545.72 A: because they just they have no idea how to cope 

545.82 546.07 A: with 

546.27 546.89 A: the cold 

547.26 548.47 A: when there's no electricity 

548.11 548.53 B: right 

548.87 549.31 B: right 

549.66 553.90 A: and it's it's all these you know i'm having all these flashbacks to like hurricane hugo time and 

554.23 557.32 A: either trying to figure out what it is about some crises that make 

557.50 562.09 A: people turn into humanitarians and then other crises make us turn into complete animals where we like 

562.71 564.49 A: attack the power line
