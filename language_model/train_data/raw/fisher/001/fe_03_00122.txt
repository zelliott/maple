71.10 71.66 B: um 

72.97 74.00 B: go on uh 

76.56 78.05 B: on a war spree on their own

88.49 89.75 A: um they being the u._s. 

90.29 90.99 B: um 

92.82 93.80 B: well they've 

94.79 95.90 B: i think there's been 

96.54 98.31 B: quite a bit of pressure going on i suppose 

99.28 102.12 B: i'm not sure i haven't followed the whole um 

105.66 113.37 A: yeah well it is kind of hard to follow any processes around here lately with them changing all the rules 

113.38 113.74 B: yeah 

115.19 115.62 B: so what is 

115.21 115.95 A: are you 

116.28 117.32 A: have you lived in the states 

117.46 118.80 A: all along like 

119.84 122.56 B: uh no i uh i have lived here for two years 

127.74 130.94 A: ach uh here you lived here yeah 

132.73 133.41 A: well 

134.42 135.46 B: so what is your opinion 

136.16 137.74 A: i 

137.85 140.13 A: my opinion is that you know we we 

142.59 146.21 A: we as like a whole world of people have tried to put together 

146.32 146.94 A: these different 

147.15 147.77 A: bodies 

148.20 149.37 A: talk to one another 

150.36 152.61 A: uh about all these issues i mean 

152.99 154.21 A: economics aids 

157.60 158.12 A: uh 

158.71 159.99 A: and then there is this whole 

161.44 162.20 A: topic of 

162.39 165.09 A: you know being militaristic for one reason or another 

169.12 175.86 A: you know and getting back to like the question of what if anything the u._s. should do about iraq i would have to agree with you that 

176.97 177.31 A: there is 

178.10 182.44 A: there is the u._n. forum for dealing with that and that we should let 

182.99 183.56 A: that 

184.21 185.97 A: process of people talking 

188.01 188.89 A: guide 

189.18 191.79 A: whatever it is that the u._s. would do 

191.97 195.17 A: even difficult for me to say what we would do (( )) and i'm 

195.80 197.17 A: i've been here all my life 

198.88 201.66 A: uh but i don't feel very we 

202.30 207.49 A: about the u._s. which was always cool -cause it is spelled uh 

210.57 213.73 B: now it's it's uh it's been uh i think it's been a very difficult 

215.18 215.61 B: um 

217.66 218.71 B: long and al- 

218.86 220.16 B: -so i think 

221.48 222.53 B: uh all this 

222.99 225.26 B: patriotism that has come up 

227.37 227.79 B: or 

228.09 230.65 B: come up it's it's become stronger 

230.74 233.34 B: uh since all this happened and i think it 

234.79 236.70 B: i think it is important to let 

237.45 238.82 B: the united nations 

239.55 240.08 B: since 

240.59 241.49 B: uh all the parts 

243.40 244.54 B: who are involved in this 

245.25 245.99 B: conflict 

247.58 249.46 B: is at least talking in that forum 

249.86 252.89 B: because we have we are dealing with very different cultures 

254.43 254.85 B: that 

254.52 256.94 A: when you said that since all of this came up 

257.06 258.57 A: what are you referring to 

258.99 260.77 B: oh since uh september eleventh 

261.44 265.16 A: do you do you think that september eleventh has anything to do with 

265.91 267.65 A: bush and iraq armed 

268.07 268.38 B: yeah 

268.76 269.23 A: you do 

269.48 269.83 B: yeah 

272.36 272.85 A: huh 

273.20 274.86 A: see i don't well okay 

275.72 278.12 A: september eleventh had something to do with bush in my opinion 

278.74 280.72 A: however i don't think iraqi armed 

281.33 282.30 A: and september eleventh 

282.52 284.06 A: have anything to do with each other at all 

286.28 287.83 A: you know that that is just something that they are 

288.39 291.39 A: that is they are playing did you ever play a game called connect the dots 

292.01 293.16 B: uh no not really 

294.43 297.61 A: the thing that we do that we do here is a kid's game and you get 

298.28 300.24 A: numbers and dots on a piece of paper 

301.15 302.67 A: start at number one and you start 

303.05 305.56 A: looking for number two and you keep drawing around and then 

305.74 307.62 A: as you do that it makes a shape 

307.67 308.35 B: okay yeah 

308.22 310.71 A: whereas before it was just dots with numbers on a page 

311.61 312.00 A: and 

312.68 313.10 A: i don't 

313.55 315.61 A: i don't think that there is a logical connection 

315.81 318.01 A: of the dots of things september eleventh and 

319.02 321.74 A: iraqi arms or lack of arms and 

322.66 323.76 A: so they are not even assoc- 

324.52 325.29 A: completely different 

325.41 326.02 A: realm 

328.17 329.92 B: oh you mean like that uh i just 

330.03 333.81 B: think that uh if september eleventh hadn't come 

334.24 336.11 B: or hadn't happened the way it has 

336.52 338.81 B: uh i don't think uh 

339.77 341.14 B: bush or the u._s. or 

342.37 342.70 B: uh 

342.88 345.21 B: would be pushing so strongly 

345.31 345.91 B: because i 

346.04 351.18 B: think or what i have heard through the media which is obviously not the best 

351.45 354.95 B: source of information here i don't think really um 

355.62 356.14 B: it is 

358.62 360.36 B: you get the feeling that 

360.47 361.90 B: that uh 

363.40 364.13 B: bush is 

364.28 364.86 B: i don't know 

366.88 368.62 B: uh pretty 

369.78 370.64 B: um 

371.58 374.85 B: well he thinks that iraq in some way had something to do 

376.38 378.52 B: uh or back door or 

378.65 379.26 B: something 

380.97 385.80 A: yeah well that is where the logic flaws right there bush and thinks doesn't really work for 

385.43 386.23 B: i know 

387.89 390.00 B: that that is why the the the this 

390.10 392.67 B: thing feels so frightening to me 

393.21 393.87 A: yeah 

393.90 394.54 B: um 

394.84 398.54 A: well you you have been here not long enough to have lived through

408.30 408.91 A: yeah 

409.52 412.61 A: well and then before that we had the honorable mister reagan 

412.69 413.27 B: oh yes 

413.53 417.07 A: also uh very interested in playing with large guns and toys 

417.98 421.36 A: and see all of these guys have a big thing in common and that is 

421.59 422.18 A: none of them 

422.92 425.42 A: have really actually had to go and do the business 

425.56 426.36 A: of war 

427.83 431.28 A: you know jimmy carter was one of our presidents he was in the navy 

432.16 435.20 A: kennedy they they hold him up as a good president 

435.53 437.63 A: he was also in the service 

438.50 441.03 A: you guys it is like they have to prove something 

441.02 441.34 B: yes 

442.41 443.01 A: and 

442.45 442.83 B: and al-

474.23 476.33 B: carter is the only one that that 

477.18 478.51 B: i find um 

481.58 482.96 B: full in mind but i mean uh 

483.47 485.19 B: not many americans like him 

486.62 487.94 A: not many americans like whom 

486.73 487.04 B: thought 

488.07 488.72 B: uh carter 

489.80 491.46 A: oh yeah well 

492.36 495.32 A: that is because they blame a a failed attempt to

506.15 509.66 A: can concoct just about anything they want i mean when you look 

510.25 512.99 A: at the cabinet members and even the new cabinet members that
