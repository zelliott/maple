0.64 2.10 A: hi my name is alissa 

2.63 4.68 B: hi my name is lisa 

7.46 12.57 A: i just watched a special today on the nightly news and it was a big thing about how 

13.22 17.95 A: when the vietnam was was going on there were all these protesters and you could tell 

18.37 19.00 A: kind of that 

19.44 21.80 A: especially the young population felt that 

22.47 23.83 A: you know it wasn't our place 

24.28 25.07 A: but now 

25.46 26.22 A: kind of the 

27.32 31.70 A: it's more behind the scenes on the internet you can see sort of peace 

32.09 36.59 A: efforts but it's not really out in the public eye and even the people that do march 

37.14 42.35 A: know it's not as many people and so it seems to me that the country as a whole perhaps 

42.99 43.84 A: supports this 

44.92 46.00 A: effort more than 

46.62 47.28 A: in the past 

50.72 51.18 B: i don't 

51.32 51.71 B: um 

52.79 54.18 B: i don't really know because 

55.94 57.97 B: i don't think it supports it more 

60.40 61.25 B: honestly 

62.36 64.45 A: and you're thinking this because 

65.06 67.64 A: people that you speak with or your colleagues at work or 

68.50 69.50 A: the news media 

70.08 71.74 B: well i just think that since it 

72.11 73.65 B: i don't know it's not as 

74.42 76.18 B: as out there like i 

76.43 80.38 B: i just don't see that many people lobbying for it or against it or 

81.92 82.74 B: that's what i mean 

83.30 85.87 A: oh so you don't think the issue at all is as prevalent as 

86.44 87.11 A: in years past 

87.24 87.95 B: exactly 

87.96 89.18 A: o._k. i thought you meant that 

89.51 90.31 A: you thought like 

90.75 95.65 A: i don't know people weren't for it and you just think that people don't really have as much of an opinion as in 

96.22 96.95 A: prior years 

96.95 97.41 B: yeah 

98.17 98.96 A: i think 

99.06 105.24 A: if it were closer to and election time for the president perhaps it would be more in the forefront 

105.35 106.11 B: exactly 

106.04 110.35 A: and people would pay a little bit more attention and i think the president would have to listen to 

110.66 112.66 A: more of what the country says instead of what 

112.94 118.34 A: he feels i used to have this vague like yes we have to get saddam hussein and i just you know 

118.77 119.18 A: but i 

119.40 122.27 A: am always big on the news as i watched the (( different )) special 

123.18 124.44 A: with like uh 

125.51 126.53 A: sixty minutes two 

126.68 127.14 B: mhm 

126.99 127.63 A: how 

129.25 132.26 A: people quote unquote leak information to the press 

132.40 134.26 A: but in fact that information isn't 

134.58 136.86 A: all true and they made a 

135.88 136.41 B: mhm 

136.97 137.45 A: um 

137.82 138.98 A: a special thing about 

140.58 147.21 A: something that iraq was trying to buy these aluminum tubes that supposedly were used for nuclear warheads and 

147.43 149.11 A: come to find out it could be used for 

149.53 151.26 A: a multitude of things 

150.99 151.53 B: mhm 

151.38 155.19 A: however when they leaked the information they were like oh yeah by the way they're for 

155.54 155.98 B: yeah 

155.60 156.82 A: nuclear bombs 

156.36 157.33 B: nuclear bombs 

157.55 163.14 A: and then of course everyone took off oh they have nuclear bombs and all of these things and then 

163.40 163.90 A: really 

164.63 165.03 A: you know that 

165.36 169.67 A: maybe that's what they were used for but maybe not it just seems that the more 

170.56 171.41 A: i watch 

171.51 173.88 A: the news the more i realize that 

175.18 176.83 A: i'm not as sure about 

177.03 178.03 A: who's telling the truth 

178.57 178.97 B: yes 

178.57 179.70 A: as i would like to be 

179.92 180.29 B: yeah 

180.85 182.57 B: i guess 

180.89 181.24 A: and i 

183.20 184.14 B: uh throughout 

184.27 185.31 B: american history 

185.63 186.79 B: the government has 

187.61 189.12 B: tried to make the people think 

189.59 191.96 B: certain things you know to meet their own 

192.69 193.47 B: to meet their own needs 

193.59 193.99 A: yeah 

193.61 195.49 B: and maybe that's what they're doing now 

195.53 197.70 A: i certainly feel like there's an agenda 

198.08 199.73 A: on the table and 

200.26 201.90 A: president bush right now 

203.03 206.78 A: i don't see him getting reelected if it were today only because 

207.35 208.66 A: i think whatever president 

208.97 209.84 A: were in place 

209.94 216.17 A: they'd really struggle because the economy is terrible unemployment is at an all time high 

216.55 216.94 A: for 

217.08 218.30 A: people my generation i'm 

218.43 219.14 A: rather young 

219.42 219.70 A: so 

220.44 221.23 A: however 

222.54 225.59 A: truly believe it would have happened to anyone under the circumstances 

225.69 226.18 B: mhm 

226.45 228.69 A: and he's really looking for a way to 

229.78 230.24 A: lead 

230.36 231.08 A: the united states 

231.59 231.99 A: people 

232.60 237.52 A: so if we could beat this terrible evil man that he has made saddam out to be 

239.37 239.78 A: then i 

239.87 240.45 A: think like 

240.58 243.30 A: he could win back his loyal fans and 

244.55 245.22 A: would certainly 

245.95 248.00 A: feel a little bit more confident in his role 

248.63 249.04 B: yeah 

250.09 251.42 A: i think it's tricky for 

252.18 252.75 A: me 

253.70 255.97 A: being as young as i am to try to 

256.44 261.71 A: suddenly now i'm forced to make decisions that used to be whatever my parents said i would just vote that and 

262.18 262.94 A: (( oh )) yes this 

263.23 265.07 A: and now i live on my own 

265.39 267.46 A: and i truly feel like i need to 

265.48 265.91 B: yeah 

268.06 269.14 A: educate myself 

269.69 270.49 A: and i teach 

270.75 273.51 A: i'm a teacher and i have kids ask me all the time 

271.61 272.05 B: mhm 

274.40 274.91 A: know what 

275.37 278.19 A: oh what does this mean arabs on t._v. is there a war 

279.00 281.94 A: like oh jeeze i'm not the one that wants to talk to you about that 

282.00 282.59 B: yeah 

282.40 283.81 A: you know go ask your folks 

282.73 283.44 B: it should r- 

284.17 284.68 B: yeah 

284.30 285.10 A: and so it's 

285.26 285.93 A: you know 

286.31 291.66 A: i think i- it is scary that now kids are truly starting to pay attention and realize it's not a joke 

292.18 294.22 A: and for the first time they could 

295.38 297.06 A: live in a country at war 

295.61 299.13 B: wait you think it's scary that they're like not longer shielded from it 

300.19 300.92 A: i think this 

301.05 302.78 A: like i remember being in school 

303.02 304.54 A: when there was the gulf war 

304.70 305.19 B: mhm 

304.85 308.62 A: or the gulf conflict as you know it's oh they couldn't call it a war 

308.46 308.98 B: yes 

308.86 309.30 A: um 

310.08 310.71 A: and 

311.13 314.65 A: it was like oh man i can't watch my t._v. shows 

314.83 316.32 A: and that was all i mean 

316.32 316.61 B: yeah 

316.90 318.48 A: oh i'll sure i'll bring in soap 

319.00 321.28 A: we had to bring a pat of soap drive at school 

321.42 321.90 B: mhm 

321.68 322.68 A: we brought in soap 

322.80 325.19 A: and i couldn't watch my t._v. shows and that's really 

325.70 327.23 A: the only i didn't get it 

327.98 331.22 A: i truly didn't get it and i think these kids now 

331.66 333.81 A: they seem to get it a little more i think 

334.05 336.51 A: probably after september eleventh that we don't feel 

337.45 337.75 A: like 

337.90 339.63 A: everything is across the ocean 

339.73 340.18 B: mhm 

340.22 341.42 A: we feel like it could really 

341.56 342.24 A: hit home 

342.40 342.69 B: yes 

343.42 346.48 A: i have kids that are honest and truly they are scared 

346.99 348.23 A: and that's a terrible thing 

349.34 349.69 A: i just 

350.01 351.99 A: maybe i wish they could be a little more sheltered 

352.90 353.76 A: more so than they are 

354.17 354.49 B: yeah 

356.87 358.07 A: are you a student or 

358.22 359.45 B: yeah i'm a student 

360.48 361.11 A: do ever have 

361.50 363.36 A: discussion in your classes about it 

363.57 366.89 B: um well my classes aren't exactly uh 

367.04 370.01 B: dealing with like current events and politics right now 

370.08 370.38 A: oh 

370.11 370.51 B: so 

372.06 372.52 A: i think 

372.13 372.74 B: but yeah 

372.83 376.59 A: like with my students it just seems to come up all the time we were talking about the 

376.77 377.55 A: the european 

378.51 379.19 A: union 

379.31 379.81 B: mhm 

379.45 382.04 A: and how now all the frontiers are down in europe and 

382.17 384.43 A: you don't have to stop for customs you just go from 

384.73 386.64 A: portugal to spain to france to italy 

386.83 387.19 B: yeah 

387.22 387.98 A: and um 

389.00 391.54 A: their big thing was oh now 

391.76 393.21 A: now that there's not frontiers 

393.51 395.51 A: they have to send the criminals back don't they 

395.90 400.92 A: instead of f- that was like such a small itty bitty tiny piece of the puzzle 

401.22 404.22 A: but that's they wanted to focus on that now the bad guys 

405.05 409.20 A: would have to go back to whatever country they were from and they couldn't be harbored as criminals 

408.67 409.11 B: mhm 

410.06 410.36 A: and that 

410.79 413.05 A: i don't know it's a little bit scary to me 

413.61 413.96 A: that 

414.26 415.29 A: kids that young 

416.28 417.51 A: that's what they care about 

419.22 421.14 A: i wish it could be a little bit easier for them 

422.10 422.77 A: i think 

422.59 424.82 B: well how wait how young are they though 

425.11 425.81 A: sixth grade 

426.54 427.14 B: o._k. 

427.55 428.49 A: that to me seems 

429.04 429.42 A: i mean 

430.08 430.70 A: they're twelve 

431.09 431.57 B: yeah 

431.64 432.38 A: they shouldn't really 

433.08 436.37 B: it's true like when i was twelve i did not think about that at all 

436.53 437.24 A: and now 

437.46 440.68 A: and i'm in a really small town i'm not in a city they don't 

441.07 441.48 A: i mean 

442.45 442.84 A: it is 

443.70 444.42 A: very 

444.80 445.74 A: homogeneous 

446.21 447.78 A: there's no one that looks different 

448.47 451.80 A: you know everyone's the same and it's this great place and oh 

452.15 452.71 A: oh 

452.88 455.88 A: why why do those people have towels on their heads it's like guys 

456.15 458.41 A: it's not a towel they have no 

458.61 459.47 A: no concept 

460.09 462.37 A: of diversity or why people would fight 

462.81 463.51 A: like um 

464.52 465.34 A: the like 

465.51 469.94 A: muslim israeli thing they truly they don't get it because they've never been exposed 

470.11 470.58 B: mhm 

470.51 471.60 A: and now i just feel like 

472.23 474.96 A: jeeze great this is my job for the next two weeks 

475.43 476.91 A: we have to teach diversity 

477.06 478.55 A: in my school only because 

479.03 480.12 A: they have never 

480.42 481.40 A: experienced it 

481.78 483.54 A: and so it's very difficult 

483.97 487.61 A: to explain to kids why they would fight why a government would go against 

487.72 488.46 A: some people 

489.35 490.19 A: why 

490.62 491.19 A: there would be 

491.71 492.75 A: i don't know like 

493.39 495.27 A: why can't they leave that country alone 

495.62 496.61 A: it's like oh 

496.85 498.59 A: i don't know sometimes i wish we would 

499.14 501.20 A: but then you have to explain about like basic 

501.29 502.25 A: civil liberties 

502.40 502.75 B: yes 

503.21 504.24 A: and i think it's 

504.53 505.79 A: it's tough for them they 

506.04 507.02 A: can't imagine 

507.49 509.47 A: anyone not living like the united states 

510.49 510.95 B: yeah 

512.66 513.30 A: certainly uh 

513.60 514.94 B: well it's i mean 

515.08 517.01 B: like what would you do about it you can't like 

517.60 519.70 B: you can't l- it all depends on like 

520.07 521.79 B: how much media they're exposed to 

521.90 522.62 B: because 

522.11 522.46 A: yeah 

522.73 524.28 B: they're on the computer all the time 

524.44 525.47 B: or watching t._v. 

525.65 526.24 A: very true 

526.66 527.74 B: and so 

527.94 530.80 B: you know they're exposed to this they see these things but 

530.95 533.03 B: they don't really have all the information 

534.02 535.36 B: so they end up confused 

535.70 536.46 A: yes they do 

536.79 539.93 A: and i just feel like i'm not the person that needs to step in and help them 

540.78 541.85 A: sometimes i just want to 

542.17 543.09 A: go ask your folks 

543.54 544.05 A: and then 

544.30 545.23 A: you know many times 

545.58 550.18 A: some of the parents aren't even literate so they're certainly not going to be able to help they just 

550.71 555.32 A: feel the fire and then the kids come in spouting racial slurs and that's certainly not what 

556.16 557.49 A: i intended to happen 

557.64 558.01 B: yeah 

558.52 558.80 A: so 

558.90 560.68 A: i just wish that there was a way 

561.49 562.92 A: that i would know the truth 

563.29 564.61 A: and then i would make my decision 

565.21 567.11 A: should we go over there and 

567.28 568.04 A: disarm 

568.36 569.18 A: saddam 

569.36 571.91 A: go into iraq i don't know because 

572.02 573.33 A: is there anything to disarm 

574.16 577.73 A: my government would have me believe yes their government would have me believe no 

574.19 575.13 B: exactly 

580.44 580.99 A: and so 

581.20 585.01 A: i just wish that somebody could look me in the eye and tell me the truth and then 

585.46 587.46 A: i think the decision would easily be made 

588.14 589.39 A: and they've got to know 

590.42 593.55 A: that just infuriates me i truly believe that our government has got to know 

593.65 595.22 B: no our government definitely knows 

595.68 596.72 B: and either 

597.11 599.06 B: you know either iraq does have 

599.61 600.96 B: weapons and 

601.21 601.67 B: you know 

601.80 602.94 B: we're being 

603.38 604.32 B: quote unquote nice 

604.82 608.22 B: and trying to rid the world of you know possible misuse 

608.75 609.47 B: or 

609.68 615.37 B: you know this is just another tactic of bush's to deflect all the criticism he has received 

615.95 617.45 B: post nine eleven 

616.07 616.51 A: certain 

617.45 617.70 A: yup 

617.93 621.36 A: and it's just like oh i just wish i knew i'm so tired of 

622.25 624.21 A: the united states being a laughing stock 

624.57 625.07 B: mhm 

624.75 626.67 A: in global politics because 

626.97 629.60 A: it's no wonder that no one takes us seriously when we have 

630.03 630.79 A: presidents that 

631.72 633.64 A: can't be faithful to their spouses 

633.93 636.43 A: all the way to presidents that can't be faithful to their country 

637.95 638.50 A: and 

640.56 641.68 A: it's just no wonder that 

642.06 642.89 A: other nations 

643.76 646.79 A: are very skeptical to jump on the united states band wagon 

646.99 647.71 A: when we say 

648.24 650.03 A: come on england we really need your help 

650.52 651.74 A: and the prime minister is 

652.14 653.30 A: is a little hesitant to 

653.88 655.12 A: you know how can you blame him 

658.08 659.81 A: i just wish that there was a way for 

660.11 660.88 A: the president 

661.39 662.52 A: to take into account
