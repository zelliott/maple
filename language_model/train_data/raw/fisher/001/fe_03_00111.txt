21.45 23.05 B: all i heard was that we're supposed to 

23.24 23.85 B: talk about 

24.05 24.78 B: uh iraq 

25.07 26.95 A: yes exactly and uh 

27.91 32.52 A: whether sh- disarming iraq should be a top priority of the u._s. 

28.14 28.57 B: and in 

32.99 33.68 A: um 

33.99 41.61 A: i don't know i actually i think i have a lot of opinions on this subject but i've been a little bit confused it seems to me that um 

42.87 43.72 A: president bush 

56.65 56.98 A: pushing 

58.56 61.19 A: um to disarm iraq and i guess get 

61.34 63.02 A: saddam hussein out of there 

63.81 64.37 A: but um 

64.88 65.36 A: i really 

65.11 65.85 B: i know it's 

66.03 68.67 B: it seems to me that the main interest on 

68.90 72.89 B: bush's part is just to get saddam hussein out of there 

73.08 77.19 B: and he's looking for any excuse that he can possibly find and 

73.57 73.99 A: right 

77.88 80.73 B: he's fishing around for something that looks like 

80.86 83.15 B: um serious enough evidence for 

83.81 86.44 B: um some kind of arms problem that 

86.07 86.52 A: right 

87.29 89.84 B: and all he really wants to do is to invade and 

89.94 91.85 B: clear his father's name and get the oil 

90.11 90.74 A: right 

101.02 101.46 B: uh-huh 

108.50 112.75 A: he looks like you know some days seventy five percent of americans are in favor of 

112.87 114.86 A: you know attacking iraq if that's 

115.06 124.37 A: going to stop the threat of saddam hussein in the world and then another days it's only thirty five percent and it's weird because it now seems that he has some evidence but 

124.64 126.12 A: he's just waiting for them 

126.62 128.54 A: to i guess uh the people at the u._n. to 

128.73 136.48 A: to read this document and see what saddam hussein says so he can say you're a liar and you broke our trust and we're going to attack you now 

134.06 134.58 B: yeah 

136.66 137.60 A: but it's weird because 

136.86 137.60 B: yeah i think 

138.67 139.45 A: i'm sorry go ahead 

138.85 141.48 B: like like he's holding his cards until 

141.12 142.99 A: yeah exactly that's what it seems like 

141.65 142.98 B: he sees what the others do 

143.10 144.52 A: at least that what's i sort of 

143.50 143.80 B: yeah 

160.18 160.75 A: then 

161.08 163.33 A: they had can say that saddam hussein broke 

163.67 164.38 A: um or 

164.62 173.25 A: whatever the um agreement that he had with the u._n. um to not produce weapons of mass destruction and therefore since that negates everything so we can attack him 

167.09 167.44 B: right 

173.90 174.17 B: right 

174.65 177.99 A: i don't know it's really it's kind of scary actually because i this is one of the 

178.25 179.35 A: at least you know in the 

179.65 189.19 A: the gulf war in nineteen ninety one i don't know i was in high school but i don't know it sort of seemed that was the right thing to do but this issue is so confusing it really is 

189.49 190.90 A: i just i mean i am 

191.10 194.53 A: generally anti war 

194.08 196.29 B: yeah i am too i'm 

194.66 198.70 A: all the time actu- i mean all the time and i i really just feel like 

198.84 202.06 A: we're so in the dark here there's something that i'm missing because 

202.70 203.56 A: i don't know it's really 

203.09 205.92 B: well i think there's something we're not being told i 

205.16 206.29 A: right i do too 

206.86 208.80 B: i i i think i'm somewhat older 

208.92 220.79 B: than you are because i've lived through vietnam and i re- i was i was in high school and college then and i really believed that we were demonstrating and we were going to put an end to the united states going in and 

209.28 209.60 A: right 

222.92 224.47 B: no reason other than 

224.69 226.18 B: we didn't like them or something 

226.05 226.52 A: right 

227.02 230.21 B: and i thought all of our demonstrating you know finally we 

231.24 232.26 B: pr- we showed that 

232.41 237.63 B: that's not what the united states should do well that's all out the window now it seems because 

236.66 240.66 A: yes and we're supposed to be the good guys that's what kills me 

240.91 242.26 A: so 

245.71 252.69 B: justification to do it and i really think that the polls they must run around and say what they want shown in a poll find 

252.81 257.52 B: seventy percent of the people who will say this and they probably throw out 

254.40 254.94 A: right 

257.79 263.50 B: people who respond until they get the percentage that they want for showing whatever they want whoever is giving the poll 

262.89 269.23 A: right no exactly i i i think the same well i'm not sure that if they're skewing the polls that way but they seem just 

269.33 278.08 A: downright skewed to me somehow uh whether or not the demographic that they're even picking from in the beginning or to start with um but it just i've never i guess 

271.37 271.76 B: yeah 

278.60 279.39 A: so it's 

279.82 290.53 A: as much as i do now that i have absolutely no say or no power in what's happening in the government it's a really really scary it's the first time i think that i've ever felt like this and i just feel like 

284.07 284.60 B: yeah 

285.46 286.95 B: i know i do too 

289.56 291.05 B: we're just all being duped 

291.01 297.06 A: exactly and i feel like we're barreling towards some awful something and 

295.08 295.83 B: i do too 

295.96 296.66 B: i 

296.86 298.40 B: i completely agree with that 

297.41 299.30 A: i mean it's certainly not going to 

299.44 305.17 A: i guess make americans any safer you know throughout the world if we do end up attacking iraq and uh 

303.14 303.64 B: no 

304.72 312.62 B: i think it's going to make us in a lot of danger because i think that there are going to be a lot of people who for some good reasons justifiable reasons really hate 

312.74 313.35 B: america 

313.37 313.83 A: right 

314.35 316.45 A: and i think that you know sort of 

316.67 319.17 A: in the past maybe five years or so it's been 

319.35 320.21 A: i guess sort of 

320.99 321.44 A: you know 

322.12 322.60 A: um 

322.87 324.77 A: a la mode to sort of 

324.89 327.41 A: you know dislike america and europe and 

327.55 334.71 A: say that you know we're bullies and things like that but now i think there really is actually going to be justification for that 

338.53 338.97 A: right 

340.59 342.88 B: (( )) english is the only language which 

346.10 347.54 B: learn other people's languages 

347.93 349.17 B: even when we went abroad 

349.37 353.24 B: and all the ugly american sort of behaviors that now i think 

351.81 352.20 A: right 

353.43 362.02 B: it's even worse than that it's not just that we're uninformed it's that we are really on some kind vendetta it's like to me it's like a religious war 

361.22 361.58 A: right 

362.19 365.58 A: right exactly and we're being you know pro active about it about about 

362.51 363.39 B: the christians 

363.81 364.29 B: yeah 

365.48 365.85 B: right 

365.78 366.73 A: sort of our 

366.10 366.55 B: yeah 

367.44 368.68 B: we're back to the crusades 

367.84 370.52 A: imperialism so 

369.46 369.77 B: yeah 

370.21 374.33 B: we're like the crusades we're we're going to go and plunder and take and 

374.77 376.91 B: we'll pretend that it's in the name of some kind of 

377.21 381.88 B: religious thing because maybe that makes us feel like we're doing something justified but 

381.86 382.23 A: right 

382.36 382.98 B: i think that 

383.55 386.14 B: are other reasons maybe it's just the oil maybe it's 

386.96 390.78 B: bush really hates all other religions or something 

391.81 394.16 B: i i can't believe that it's to protect americans 

391.92 392.41 A: i just 

398.54 410.37 A: like you said before you know the ugly americans you know they're sort of stereotypes have existed for a long time but now americans are in physical danger when they travel in other parts of the world that aren't even i muslim countries you know 

403.92 404.31 B: yeah 

406.41 406.73 B: yeah 

409.95 410.30 B: yeah 

412.79 417.34 B: and we can even be in danger here because there are enough muslims in this country that could hate us 

418.16 419.14 B: hate the non muslims 

426.68 427.05 B: yeah 

426.77 436.61 A: so far and i don't know if i can chalk it up to great security because i don't trust the security all that much i think it really is just luck and uh 

432.30 433.80 B: no i think it's just luck 

433.96 434.31 B: yeah 

436.06 438.25 B: disorganization on the part of other people 

437.40 439.24 A: exac- yeah exactly disorganization 

439.38 444.18 A: and maybe i guess government agencies are getting a little bit in the way of the organization of these um 

444.78 448.41 A: i guess terrorists or whatever or sympathizers in america 

448.51 455.28 A: but um i don't know i think the biggest threat to us right now is our government and it's really it's terrifying 

453.39 464.32 B: i do too i do too um i went to the i was in um a train station where there was a book store recently looking for another book and i came across this book called ugly was it 

464.43 468.42 B: stupid white men stupid white men which i've only read the first five pages 

468.64 477.88 B: that is basically what it is saying in there is that our greatest danger is the government that is now in power and that we ought to appeal to the u._n. for some safe protection 

478.07 478.52 A: right 

478.29 480.33 B: from our government 

487.03 492.40 A: try to (( defect )) to any i guess industrialized country in the world and say that you know i 

492.50 498.63 A: and seeking asylum from my country and they'd probably let me come like i really i mean especially canada or 

494.27 494.63 B: yeah 

495.07 495.45 B: yeah 

496.19 496.53 B: yeah 

498.75 502.22 A: you know sensible country like that so um 

499.16 499.57 B: yeah 

500.90 508.28 B: i s- i i i would hope so or australia i think we ought to many of us ought to go help poor australia here they probably got 

504.61 504.89 A: right 

508.46 511.18 B: this horrible incident in bali because of us 

511.22 512.14 A: right exactly 

511.68 514.84 B: because they supposedly helping us and from what i heard 

524.32 524.66 A: right 

524.42 527.69 B: yet they thought they were helping us and look what happened to them
