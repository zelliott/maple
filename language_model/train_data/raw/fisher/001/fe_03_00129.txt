8.23 9.40 B: (( [noise] um )) 

9.67 10.79 B: (( i )) 

10.89 15.01 B: on the whole i think the economy would have a hard time 

15.08 24.24 B: withstanding um a war with iraq which [laughter] of course is one of the possible outcomes of the arms inspection 

18.08 19.43 A: mhm 

24.29 25.31 A: yeah 

24.31 31.61 B: but i also think that [noise] it's really important to make critical decisions when critical decisions are called for you know 

31.41 35.46 A: right yeah and it's it's so hard to know 

35.66 40.87 A: you know where that line is between it being necessary or not you know 

40.35 41.41 B: absolutely 

41.06 48.70 A: and i think none of us really have the whole story you know and i wonder whether governments do either you know i kind of doubt it 

46.96 48.02 B: mhm 

48.51 49.98 B: [mn] yeah 

49.45 50.44 A: but 

50.07 56.22 B: um my husband was actually [noise] just finished reading a book on revolutions 

56.05 57.09 A: (( uh-huh )) 

56.15 68.74 B: and he said he said that one of the things that he noticed in it [mn] is that um leaders who who when the time to make decisions is there leaders who do not 

68.90 74.51 B: make a decision [noise] end up costing a lot of lives he gave the example of french revolution 

74.61 75.62 B: (( where )) 

76.68 80.50 B: king louis whatever [laughter] i don't know what number 

78.44 79.49 A: uh-huh 

80.51 86.69 B: (( he um [mn] there was a there was a there was an uprising and th- the )) 

87.89 94.66 B: well the the gu- or the swiss guard put down the uprising came to the king and told him what had happened they said 

94.63 107.93 B: [noise] um we've put it down and there's been a a group of them a large group that has fled do you want us to to follow them and and take care of it and just end this now and the king's like i won't kill my own people 

103.91 104.63 A: mhm 

108.17 112.33 A: right but that inaction resulted in all kinds of problems 

108.63 109.57 B: which 

111.68 115.73 B: exactly it made for a lot more loss of blood 

112.55 113.79 A: yeah 

114.85 115.52 A: [cough] 

115.56 118.13 A: yeah gosh it's interesting 

118.17 124.67 A: yeah it's hard i have real mixed feelings too my husband is in the air force he's in air force pilot training right now 

124.72 136.63 A: and um so yeah war doesn't seem like a great idea to m- you know but ah you know going into the air force you can't expect that nothing will ever happen you know 

129.37 130.59 B: (( uh-huh no )) 

135.85 136.99 B: mhm 

136.86 144.29 A: um and i saw some interesting things about it on t._v. too i saw a news commentator who was saying that 

144.36 148.26 A: like president bush's real motivation for wanting to 

148.66 161.14 A: eliminate problems in ira- in iraq um was because iraq um trains a lot of the suicide bombers and the people who cause problems in israel and palestine 

161.26 171.25 A: and just fueling that conflict and because of that there's a lot of anti american sentiment you know and it helps al qaeda and all the other groups 

167.88 168.89 B: mhm 

170.99 172.33 B: mhm [noise] 

171.12 182.93 A: and so if you know we get saddam out of power he won't be able to help fuel that fire or whatever so i thought that was interesting but i don't know you know if it's really 

180.07 181.04 B: (( mhm )) 

183.02 186.64 A: accurate or just you know his thoughts 

185.39 193.97 B: yeah and you wonder too if saddam i mean is as charismatic as he may be you know i wonder how much is really 

194.40 203.30 B: all of his fault for fueling misunderstandings and and false representations i think that there's ignorance on both sides 

198.08 199.37 A: mhm 

202.97 205.22 A: oh yeah definitely definitely 

204.58 205.90 B: tons of it 

206.04 206.87 B: like 

207.26 214.18 B: e- even my parents my parents are from are from idaho and really ve- very conservative 

213.88 214.99 A: uh-huh 

214.44 216.07 B: and um 

216.51 221.64 B: they just have completely different perceptions of what 

222.17 228.93 B: what it is to be arab and and what the people are like really i spent a little bit of time in israel myself and 

228.29 229.74 A: oh uh-huh 

229.58 240.42 B: and i loved the muslim people there they were so kind and generous and you'd see them with their families and they're so family oriented 

234.85 236.38 A: mhm 

239.98 241.46 A: mhm 

240.25 246.51 B: they you never get anything ah like that off of the um media you know 

244.46 245.14 A: the 

245.41 247.72 A: t._v. news yeah definitely 

247.54 251.02 B: and i can only imagine what they get 

251.23 254.53 B: what they understand about americans from the media you know 

254.00 265.28 A: oh yeah yeah i'm sure you know i've also had i i'm an e._s._l. teacher and i've had a lot of positive experiences with students from the middle east that are studying over here 

259.76 260.59 B: oh 

265.42 266.53 A: so 

266.21 271.15 B: [sigh] yeah they're wonderful people i mean the people that i've met 

271.07 272.27 A: right 

271.60 275.39 B: in fact i [noise] just this weekend we happened to [lipsmack] 

275.53 279.46 B: my husband is studying middle eastern he's doing middle eastern studies 

277.75 281.30 A: oh wow yeah so he's an expert huh 

280.93 284.98 B: well [laughter] getting there he's trying to be [noise] learning to be 

285.25 299.85 B: and we went to a mosque this fri- or saturday just to watch some prayer callers and stuff and after after the prayers were over several people came up to us and shook our hands and 

289.34 290.44 A: uh-huh 

292.07 293.15 A: cool 

299.98 305.87 B: you know introduced themselves they were really welcoming and very very cordial 

300.44 302.73 A: were welcoming and kind 

303.77 305.03 A: yeah 

305.64 314.11 A: yeah [lipsmack] so it's interesting yeah [mn] but it's really tough to know about iraq 

313.94 314.98 B: yeah 

314.37 325.54 A: i mean and you know i've seen things on t._v. too that talk about the you know human rights violations and all the you know horrible things people being killed over there and stuff and 

322.64 323.81 B: mhm 

324.13 325.13 B: mhm 

325.68 331.20 A: you know i'm sure some of that stuff is going on [mn] and you know that's not right 

328.94 329.98 B: mhm 

331.59 341.99 A: but it's where do you draw that line of force becoming necessary to take over and i don't know about the inspections themselves and whether they really are 

334.35 335.40 B: yeah 

338.00 338.76 B: (( uh-huh )) 

342.02 343.68 A: going to do anything 

343.62 344.57 B: uh-huh 

344.16 345.34 A: you know like 

345.52 349.77 A: if they'll be able to uncover weapons that are there 

350.03 359.17 A: i kind of suspect that you know saddam is one step ahead of the inspectors as far as hiding that he wouldn't want them to find you know 

358.85 364.99 B: i would imagine so i um i just saw an article not too long ago about um 

364.44 365.14 A: [cough] 

365.22 369.86 B: a woman who's the head of the biological warfare in iraq and 

369.03 371.45 A: oh interesting 

369.96 384.23 B: she was just a a really small woman and looked really nice actually and it talked about her personal life how she was a mother and she had a six month old baby and she had been educated at cambridge in in england and 

375.79 376.66 A: huh 

379.56 380.79 A: mhm 

383.31 384.69 A: wow 

384.38 394.02 B: and really in her class she never really stood out in her class but she's manufactured enough um chemicals to kill the world twice with smallpox 

393.46 395.44 A: oh my gosh 

394.86 398.99 B: yeah [laughter] and she's 

396.36 397.39 A: wow 

399.19 403.49 B: just a really unassuming woman but and yet she has this 

403.91 406.56 B: incredible killing power [laughter] 

405.81 408.18 A: right wow 

406.91 414.05 B: and you wonder just what kind of stuff that he has if he has you know enough germ warfare to do that 

413.43 417.72 A: mhm [lipsmack] oh my gosh yeah that's pretty serious 

417.60 418.66 B: yeah 

417.81 419.41 A: (( [lipsmack] wow )) 

419.58 420.59 A: wow 

421.41 423.19 A: (( well [lipsmack] )) 

423.05 426.03 B: yeah [laughter] so what does your husband think of it [noise] mhm mhm yeah 

423.61 424.30 A: (( but )) 

425.57 426.66 A: um 

426.69 438.43 A: h- you know he doesn't really know either that's a that's a good question you know i've kind of asked him a little bit and he's like well you know we should go to war if it's necessary but like 

437.40 438.36 B: mhm 

438.63 444.08 A: i'm like well is it you know and he's not s- he's not sure you know 

444.19 449.55 A: i mean i think he has some confidence in president bush you know 

449.47 450.30 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

449.62 453.03 A: um as far as like trusting him but 

453.73 458.35 A: i don't know [lipsmack] neither of us are really sure about that 

459.14 460.26 A: so 

461.36 464.95 B: um what is it about president bush that makes him trust him 

465.14 466.74 A: oh that's a good question 

466.45 471.12 B: or do you think that he would have trusted a previous president as much uh-huh 

466.91 467.93 A: (( i )) 

469.95 476.77 A: [mn] you know i don't think he had very much confidence in president clinton as far the way that he 

477.23 486.56 A: um he demonstrated you know dishonestly in on a couple of acc- accounts and things like that you know and he felt like president bush was 

486.53 488.69 A: you know more honest 

488.60 501.86 A: um and you know has a little more similar values and of course you know president president bush's support of the military is something that he felt was important and you know agreed with that [lipsmack] 

499.50 500.46 B: mhm 

501.99 504.39 A: um [lipsmack] but 

504.52 507.76 A: yeah but i'm not i'm not real sure 

507.65 508.61 B: (( [noise] ))

515.10 517.89 A: oh gosh [laughter] that's serious 

517.75 518.80 B: mhm 

518.13 526.65 A: um so anyway so when you were in you went to israel you said were you there for an extended period or time or just a short trip 

522.68 523.56 B: uh-huh 

525.94 529.05 B: i was just there on a study abroad for six weeks 

528.62 535.43 A: for six weeks so did you ever have any like negative experiences with any of the people 

529.57 530.66 B: mhm 

535.03 542.68 B: i was actually there on um israel's fiftieth birthday so ther- there was a bit of um 

539.22 540.09 A: oh 

543.03 546.02 A: like protests and demonstrations at that time 

543.94 545.00 B: yeah 

545.65 550.14 B: yeah in fact we were on a bus on our way back to where we were staying 

550.19 551.33 A: mhm 

550.22 552.13 B: um one night and 

552.14 552.81 B: (( [noise] )) 

552.85 553.79 B: um 

554.34 558.18 B: on the in the road to where we were going there was 

558.39 565.36 B: a protest set up and a bunch of tires out in the road and the palestinian groups were um 

565.75 570.69 B: had a bonfire and were protesting and like that and there was a murder 

567.92 569.49 A: (( [mn] right )) 

570.71 573.31 B: near the dome of the rock while i 

570.77 571.82 A: wow 

573.54 579.16 A: wow but that wasn't necessarily like anti american it was more anti israeli 

573.63 574.26 B: (( was )) 

578.94 584.02 B: there yeah yeah but the prob- problem is that [cough] excuse me 

579.71 580.98 A: yeah 

584.30 590.88 B: [lipsmack] that the palestinians associate americans with the israelis because they've funded so much you know 

588.23 590.36 A: with always supporting them 

590.66 595.96 A: yeah yeah [lipsmack] huh well that's really interesting [noise] 

596.80 605.22 B: yeah and like yesterday or last week i was listening to a a talk radio host and he was talking about how 

605.58 609.27 B: [laughter] the palestinians and the arabs were so awful because 

609.40 611.18 B: they couldn't [noise] [lipsmack] 

611.33 617.32 B: have a well developed country like israel could you know [laughter] he's like yeah he said 

614.83 617.76 A: (( what what did he mean )) 

618.17 618.90 B: (( [cough] )) 

619.49 621.32 B: the guy was just ignorant 

621.13 622.29 A: uh-huh 

621.42 622.83 B: he um 

624.00 631.28 B: he talked about how going to tel aviv is just like going to some places in california which is true tel aviv is a really modern city 

630.90 631.95 A: uh-huh 

631.46 634.74 B: but he comp- compared it [cough] sorry 

635.19 636.39 B: to um 

637.14 641.91 B: to the um palestinian camps which are 

640.70 641.75 A: mhm 

642.27 645.04 B: really are not in good condition 

644.73 645.92 A: uh-huh 

645.54 646.47 B: um 

646.59 649.85 B: definitely not up to first world stan- standards 

649.33 650.59 A: mhm 

650.45 655.89 B: and he was just saying that that reflects on the character of the people which is ridiculous 

655.64 657.99 A: yeah i agree oh 

656.30 660.45 B: because the israelis have had [cough] i'm sorry 

660.56 664.63 B: the israelis have had so much american funding 

664.30 668.76 A: yeah mhm yeah definitely so much support 

668.24 669.11 B: (( [cough] )) 

669.42 671.28 A: it wasn't just them 

671.41 672.44 B: right 

672.11 676.21 A: yeah huh well that's really interesting 

676.27 677.13 B: yeah 

676.50 682.12 A: yeah i think there are so many misconceptions on both sides i guess but 

679.84 681.01 B: yeah 

681.49 683.19 B: yeah 

682.21 686.69 A: it was really sad wh- you know after september eleventh and an- and everything 

686.60 690.19 A: um some of the arab students that i had like 

686.91 688.00 B: (( [noise] )) 

690.09 703.27 A: they really had a hard time by you know just rude american students you know who were just totally ignorant and you know saying things to them and [lipsmack] so it was really a shame 

697.40 698.43 B: mhm 

700.77 702.00 B: (( mhm hm )) 

703.46 710.54 B: [mn] i can't even [laughter] that's just inconceivable to me how people can just generalize like that but 

707.76 708.81 A: yeah 

710.93 714.15 B: well i probably do it and don't even know it but 

714.15 719.90 A: it's yeah i it is unconscious for them you know so yeah i'm sure there are things that we do t
