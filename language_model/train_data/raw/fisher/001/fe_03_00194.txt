97.94 102.48 A: yeah i do actually i have a huge family my immediate family is not that big but i have tons of like 

102.74 104.93 A: cousins and you know kind of m-

127.20 127.98 B: but 

127.35 129.26 A: yeah crazy aunt edna and all that stuff 

129.34 129.87 B: yeah 

130.04 132.33 B: yeah so if you would g- 

132.43 133.45 B: we're going to um 

133.67 137.68 B: have a holiday you made up what do you think it would be 

137.67 143.39 A: uh you know ah god i don't know i've never really thought about that i can think of a few i would like to get rid of i always call them the um 

143.53 146.96 A: um the hallmark holidays where it seems like they're really 

147.07 152.14 A: th- they just exist because hallmark needs another day to sell a lot of cards (( )) 

150.64 153.14 B: right right 

152.38 160.02 A: but as far as like i really think that thanksgiving does kind of in- in- in- in the (( truest )) sense of what you are supposed to do on thanksgiving 

159.98 160.93 B: mhm 

160.26 160.99 A: is um 

161.16 164.05 A: really heavy it (( )) of what i 

164.42 166.47 A: i really like a- about 

166.59 170.15 A: holidays where you sit there and you really think about what your life is and 

169.80 170.29 B: yeah 

170.51 172.64 A: what you've got to be grateful for 

172.89 173.53 B: right 

173.03 173.45 A: so 

173.67 174.53 A: but what about you 

187.06 190.53 B: sit back and enjoy it and enjoy the people 

190.98 196.06 B: that like your family and get together with them that i think those are the best ones 

191.06 191.77 A: mhm 

196.18 197.32 A: i'd agree 

196.54 196.95 B: (( )) 

197.44 202.22 A: i agree i think you know i mean how often to you really get an opportunity to just sit down and relax 

202.66 209.85 A: with your family it doesn't happen often i mean i- i don't know if your family is anything like mine but everybody is just so busy like trying to fig- 

203.71 204.47 B: mhm 

208.78 209.49 B: right 

209.97 212.21 A: (( )) when you can actually get 

212.49 213.97 A: a day that everyone 

214.08 214.39 A: (( good )) 

214.69 215.76 A: is ridiculous 

214.89 215.66 B: mhm 

216.09 216.88 B: and (( )) 

216.17 216.84 A: we didn't 

224.51 229.17 B: usually trying to get my mom to put up the christmas tree this year and she was (( )) to put up uh 

229.37 235.75 B: smaller christmas tree that was like not the tradition and he just you know couldn't stand it so i think just 

232.59 233.00 A: (( mhm )) 

235.84 238.98 B: the tradition (( then )) holidays too can be real important 

239.05 240.63 A: i think they are because i think 

240.75 246.44 A: it's funny we had a similar situation but i mean (( )) my sister and i are (( )) definitely been out of the house for 

246.53 250.46 A: ten plus years but my nephew my sister's son is 

250.60 252.67 A: three and um my mom 

252.86 259.14 A: wanted to get a tree and my father is like why are we getting a tree no one is coming here for christmas we're all going we're all going to my sister's house because it's 

259.25 260.09 A: bigger and it's 

260.45 263.35 A: kind of in between where everyone lives and it's just much more convenient 

263.80 264.69 B: mhm 

263.94 272.19 A: then my dad is like i'm not going out and chopping down a tree and putting up this tree because there is no reason no one is going to see it and my mom is just like 

272.43 280.29 A: it's for the baby and it's (( )) because he is the first grandchild so of course anything he wants is 

279.56 281.01 B: oh definitely 

281.01 283.30 A: oh yeah he is so spoiled it's ridiculous like 

283.40 284.92 B: oh well that's good though 

283.45 284.83 A: when he has a little brother 

285.29 286.19 A: yeah if he ever has 

285.33 286.20 B: that's good 

286.58 287.43 A: i think (( )) 

287.61 290.10 A: he is not a brat but he definitely doesn't 

290.20 293.22 A: lack for any attention um

413.81 417.12 A: i started traveling and just started i've lived kind of all over and 

417.34 418.86 A: traveled for about twelve years and 

419.42 419.73 A: i just 

420.22 425.19 A: started like i went back to school a few years ago in california and i was supposed to go to berkeley and i 

425.44 428.43 A: decided not to because i was going to come home and 

428.32 428.96 B: mhm

436.61 438.15 A: but and i also kind of like 

438.27 439.26 A: i i- i- 

439.44 442.26 A: i'm happy at penn i think penn is an amazing school i mean it's 

442.82 444.20 A: you know one of the top five in the country 

444.58 445.20 B: mhm 

444.99 445.35 A: but um 

445.51 447.12 A: definitely more than 

447.32 448.04 A: more than 

448.42 450.64 A: thrilled to be going there but i think um 

451.38 454.87 A: there you know of course everybody has regrets like you make choices in life you know and 

455.36 455.94 B: right 

456.08 457.96 B: well whe- where in europe did you live 

456.11 456.37 A: yeah 

458.38 459.32 A: i lived in london 

459.81 460.44 B: ok 

459.85 461.72 A: i lived in london yeah (( )) 

460.90 462.36 B: well that's a neat experience 

462.49 464.26 A: it was great i 

464.62 472.17 A: i really think that traveling is the best thing anybody can do and i think americans really don't put enough emphasis on it i think um like 

467.81 468.37 B: mhm 

472.28 482.34 A: the idea that most of us don't speak another language and you know we're really kind of um because i mean fortunately we can be this way but um we're really kind of um 

482.78 483.86 A: egocentric 

484.24 484.84 B: mhm 

484.40 484.79 A: and it's 

485.19 486.33 A: because we can be 

486.56 488.02 A: you know and um 

486.84 487.87 B: right right 

488.79 490.29 A: but i definitely think that i- 

490.79 494.61 A: we need to kind of expand our horizons the world is changing and 

494.71 495.75 A: the idea of us 

495.85 496.83 A: we have this 

497.14 500.75 A: kind of concept of ourselves as these um 

501.62 508.29 A: you know like we're the world saviors and we're going in and we do what is right and all that stuff and the rest of the world doesn't necessarily always think that 

508.56 516.96 A: you know they have their own ways of being and their own traditions and their own you know what i mean and hundreds of thousands of years of of being that way you know and we think that we're going to go in and 

508.87 509.69 B: yeah 

517.34 527.25 A: save them from themselves and that ki- that mentality i mean the english have that same mentality and as much as we put down the english for the way (( they've )) kind of took over the planet um 

527.80 528.15 A: you know 

528.24 533.39 A: two hundred years ago three hundred years ago (( we already )) do the same thing you know there is a mcdonald's everywhere 

533.71 534.11 B: right 

534.40 540.33 A: and that's kind of disturbing when you really start to travel and you really start to see how the rest of the world sees americans 

541.09 541.82 B: definitely i- 

541.19 541.75 A: yes 

541.93 542.99 B: oh sorry 

543.26 545.00 A: that's okay wher- have you traveled 

569.79 571.27 A: you really should 

583.09 583.51 A: mhm 

592.31 593.29 A: like even back to the 

592.40 592.96 B: mhm
