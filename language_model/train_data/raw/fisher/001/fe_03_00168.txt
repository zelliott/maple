21.15 23.36 B: no not any particular one 

24.79 25.56 B: um 

26.91 28.99 B: i like odd ball holidays 

29.99 30.54 B: ones that 

30.82 32.49 B: most people don't celebrate 

32.67 33.95 A: like what 

33.67 34.08 B: well 

35.18 35.74 B: um 

36.19 37.65 B: maybe the winter solstice 

38.53 39.89 B: or the summer solstice 

41.21 42.26 A: how do you celebrate 

42.45 43.76 A: those 

44.01 46.52 B: well i just take note that um 

46.76 47.70 B: it's happening 

48.42 49.21 B: and uh 

49.37 51.24 B: i try to go outside and look at the 

51.96 53.45 B: the sun or notice when 

52.66 53.47 A: hm 

53.69 55.15 B: how long the day lasts 

55.77 56.87 B: but that's all i do 

58.61 59.97 B: other people might do more 

60.72 62.63 A: hm um i'm 

63.02 65.40 A: i guess opposite i'm more in to like 

66.36 67.90 A: exciting holidays 

68.02 71.42 A: i don't know i like christmas a lot i like the s- season 

72.00 76.46 A: i don't know i enjoy like decorations and christmas music and 

77.02 81.34 A: i guess it's a bit overdone but i still like it 

83.57 84.73 A: um 

83.65 84.67 B: oh 

87.01 89.33 B: i like them also but uh it's 

90.02 92.54 B: i like christmas and thanksgiving but 

93.62 96.09 B: commercially overdone to the point that 

96.21 97.47 B: i almost can't stand it 

98.63 101.79 A: uh-huh well i feel that everyone kind of feels that way but it 

102.30 103.21 A: um 

103.62 105.46 A: i'm not sure there is much you can do about that 

106.70 109.36 A: other than i guess ignore it but 

107.21 107.63 B: um 

109.18 110.40 B: or try to ignore it 

110.02 111.23 A: mhm 

112.28 115.94 A: mhm oh 

116.19 117.01 B: what about 

117.13 118.18 B: um 

118.99 120.30 B: holidays that 

123.60 125.36 B: um i'm like uh 

126.53 129.33 B: anniversaries of an event like 

129.98 131.80 B: uh fourth of july 

131.71 133.35 A: um 

135.03 135.76 A: i guess 

136.37 138.93 A: i can't think of too many holidays like that 

139.66 140.98 A: i guess 

141.59 144.61 A: i i enjoy holidays in general but 

145.50 147.65 A: um i find that like 

147.76 150.12 A: i don't celebrate those as 

150.59 151.82 A: i don't know 

152.09 156.71 A: as much or to the same extent or that if i i don't know 

156.95 163.19 A: it seems like when we do celebrate it it's not so much because of what happened it's just because it's a holiday 

163.66 165.23 A: if that makes any sense 

165.20 171.29 B: well the best part of a holiday is being off for a day and getting to do something different 

168.72 170.22 A: uh-huh 

170.49 170.92 A: huh 

172.38 174.12 A: mhm i have to agree with that 

174.88 176.94 A: i'm i'm a student so i 

177.96 180.79 A: very much in to holidays -cause i don't have 

180.94 182.47 A: classes 

182.64 184.06 A: but 

183.46 185.82 B: if you could invent a holiday 

186.30 187.88 B: what do you think you might do 

189.37 190.78 A: um 

190.95 197.71 A: i see i don't know i think that was kind kind of a a strange question but um 

197.85 199.90 A: i 

200.77 202.79 A: i guess i would probably it was just an 

203.10 204.65 A: a quiet holiday 

204.95 211.36 A: i don't really even know like what it would be celebrating or why but basically a day that everyone got off work and 

212.01 213.62 A: out of school and 

214.28 215.80 A: make it in the summer time so that 

215.99 217.84 A: and everyone could go outside and 

218.21 219.86 A: enjoy it but 

220.25 221.98 A: i don't i don't really 

222.73 225.54 A: hm can't think of a good reason to just 

227.44 229.12 A: create one how about you 

229.46 232.80 B: what of a holiday like uh kwanzaa which is 

232.96 235.03 B: was recently invented 

234.25 236.05 A: mhm 

235.17 238.12 B: and it's uh a very thoughtful holiday 

239.31 241.34 B: in a way it reminds me of lent 

242.25 243.82 A: hm 

242.48 244.50 B: -cause it's a time of reflection 

245.58 246.42 B: and uh 

249.45 250.26 A: so do you 

249.83 252.82 B: and i guess almost a planning of how you might 

253.15 254.53 B: live your life differently 

255.84 258.44 A: mhm so do you 

258.87 259.95 A: celebrate holidays 

260.48 260.84 A: that 

261.06 261.67 A: of like 

261.77 264.12 A: like around the world or are you just 

264.58 267.76 A: are of certain religions or 

268.10 271.23 B: um i do have a poster showing 

271.83 282.53 B: holidays around the world and of different religions and cultures and many of them are things i never heard of before so i find that interesting 

277.02 277.67 A: mhm 

283.20 285.38 A: so do you take efforts 

285.82 287.79 A: to celebrate them or 

288.99 291.17 B: uh mainly i just 

291.98 293.95 B: take note that it's happening 

295.11 297.78 B: uh it's like pearl harbor day um 

297.61 298.53 A: mhm 

298.03 300.27 B: i notice it every year but 

300.97 303.48 B: and it makes me think of certain people i know 

304.17 309.35 B: um who were alive at that time but i don't do 

310.30 312.77 B: i don't actually go out and celebrate 

312.90 313.35 B: uh 

313.65 314.11 A: mhm 

313.98 314.28 B: or 

314.48 316.83 B: any do anything noticeable like 

316.95 319.99 B: put a flag up 

318.13 320.62 A: yeah i don't think most people do but 

321.33 322.57 B: it's just something uh 

322.94 324.33 A: mhm 

323.76 325.02 B: i notice every year 

325.99 328.60 A: huh 

326.26 328.43 B: partly because it's on the calendar 

329.07 331.65 A: yes i i guess i am the same way only i don't usually 

332.11 335.05 A: a lot of times i don't even know what the holiday is and i'm 

335.58 340.30 A: you know i just scan over it as i'm writing on like my day planner and then 

341.53 344.19 A: never really give it a second thought but 

345.12 348.22 A: um 

348.40 348.84 A: well that 

348.96 350.36 A: i 

350.59 353.19 A: i just think holidays are interesting in general 

353.97 356.73 A: and i guess i wish i knew more about different ones 

356.84 357.53 A: but 

357.98 360.10 B: i wish there was a holiday like uh 

360.21 362.46 B: take a hike or fly a kite 

362.78 364.48 B: because those are things that 

365.27 368.45 B: i would like to do but i never got around to doing them 

368.49 369.48 A: mhm 

369.34 370.52 B: so if we had a 

370.66 371.13 A: huh 

373.89 378.09 A: i suppose although that's something we can do on any holiday really 

378.90 379.58 B: that's true 

378.93 383.06 A: um maybe you should just make a point of 

383.55 386.38 A: having your next holiday being one of those things but 

387.06 387.96 A: hm 

389.28 390.99 B: that's right maybe saturday 

392.01 392.41 B: uh 

394.45 395.94 B: i should make that fly a kite day 

396.45 397.38 A: you you could 

398.00 398.37 A: um 

401.57 405.38 A: so is that the kind of holiday you would create if you had the option 

407.15 407.83 B: um 

414.34 416.13 B: i think so i would check in to it 

416.83 417.51 A: hm 

418.75 420.07 B: um 

420.48 421.00 A: huh 

421.45 422.95 B: do you decorate for christmas 

423.68 424.77 A: um 

424.89 426.66 A: not much 

427.06 430.14 A: i i think that christmas decorations are very nice 

430.31 431.47 A: but i 

432.01 434.31 A: i don't usually take the time to 

434.78 436.17 A: decorate very much 

436.68 441.23 A: or and especially i really don't like taking down decorations 

441.96 444.26 A: so i generally don't put many up 

442.08 442.67 B: yes 

444.56 446.27 B: just packing them away is 

446.75 447.47 B: a chore 

447.65 449.47 A: mhm 

448.22 450.51 B: i have put up a few in my office 

450.76 452.40 A: mhm 

451.30 451.72 B: um 

453.57 455.58 B: but it's not going to be very many 

455.96 457.16 A: mhm 

456.28 458.67 B: and i probably won't put up very many at home 

458.61 460.75 A: mhm 

461.23 463.10 B: but i like to look at other people's 

463.66 465.87 B: uh decorations even if they 

466.93 468.63 B: are kind of strange 

469.56 471.08 B: or uh excessive 

471.97 473.78 B: it just makes things different 

472.04 472.48 A: uh-huh 

475.28 477.73 A: i i agree i think it's always really nice when 

478.19 480.17 A: you see everyone's christmas lights 

480.64 481.68 A: go on and 

481.80 484.83 A: the so- you know some people do put a lot of time in it and 

485.32 487.12 A: it looks nice i 

487.69 491.80 A: i don't know i don't enjoy them quite as much when you are in 

492.10 496.13 A: july and you see houses that still have christmas lights hanging on them but 

497.32 499.07 A: um 

500.18 503.36 A: i guess it's it's nice i think it's strange that 

504.19 506.69 A: i don't know christmas is usually the only holiday that 

506.85 508.63 A: people get so worked up about 

508.77 509.46 A: that 

510.05 515.36 A: they decorate their houses i mean it seems that most of the holidays people will 

515.88 518.88 A: put up one or two small things and
