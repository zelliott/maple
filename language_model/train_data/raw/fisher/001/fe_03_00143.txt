46.49 47.61 A: um 

47.76 61.23 A: [mn] i don't know it's definitely typical for a republican government [laughter] and that a lot of it i honestly think is because of his father and like just kind of wanting t- you know because of what all happened with 

52.39 53.52 B: [laughter] 

53.54 55.00 B: yeah yeah 

61.33 66.33 A: bush senior and he's just trying to do the s- like kind of make up for his father 

66.40 67.49 A: (( 'cause )) 

67.77 71.85 A: clinton didn't do anything [laughter] and um 

69.59 70.78 B: [laughter] 

72.01 73.95 A: so i think he's just 

74.41 82.32 A: following in the same footsteps and having the same enemies and i completely disagree and i'm really sick of hearing about it on t._v. and i wish all the crap would just stop 

80.52 82.06 B: [laughter] 

82.94 83.92 B: (( ah )) 

84.47 90.62 B: all most american people dislike that but i don't know why 

91.01 94.32 B: do the republicans ah succeed 

95.61 97.81 B: in the last election 

98.06 100.19 B: no no no at just ah 

99.49 105.15 A: mhm [noise] mhm 

101.15 103.33 B: the mid term election you know 

104.25 105.15 B: so 

105.67 108.95 B: i don't know [laughter] i i'm not familiar with 

109.11 113.17 B: with this topic actually [laughter] 

111.31 124.73 A: right i don't really have too much of an opinion on it other than i'm annoyed of hearing of it and it's definitely just because we have a republican government and i don't think that he is nearly as much of a threat as everybody says he is 

124.66 130.19 A: and i think we're just trying to push people around 'cause that's what democratic governors ah republican 

130.89 136.21 A: you know people do they [mn] always are wanting to start a fight and 

131.91 132.75 B: (( mm )) 

137.17 139.97 A: [mn] do all that good stuff [laughter] 

140.09 141.07 B: (( oh )) 

143.55 146.86 B: can you predict the if if ah 

146.94 148.56 B: u._s. 

148.65 149.78 B: um 

151.99 156.87 B: after the war on iraq ah were it to succeed or not 

156.66 158.30 A: [noise] um 

158.66 160.56 A: it depends i don't really think 

160.63 166.64 A: it depends on if saddam hussein thinks he's in a in major like if he's at 

166.86 169.44 A: if he's what's the word i'm looking for like 

170.40 175.69 A: if he's threatened by it and he thinks that he's going to be killed whether it's assassinated or just whatever 

175.50 189.46 A: if he thinks he's going to lose power i honestly think that he will use the weapons that he is hiding and he is going to basically end up killing us all because [mn] the weapons that he has will eventually 

190.01 192.57 A: (( [mn] whether he like a nuclear weapon )) 

192.46 206.81 A: eventually will be in the area and eventually everybody would die from it it would destroy the entire world i think if he thinks he's going to die he's the type of man that would take everybody else down with him [mn] and it just scares me to death that bush is being as ignorant as he is and 

206.49 208.14 B: mhm yeah 

207.54 210.03 A: doing the things he's doing and i hope that 

210.25 214.96 A: what happens is we kind of push around a little bit and then finally back off but 

215.76 219.71 A: i don't know i'm definitely a democrat [laughter] 

218.04 220.81 B: [laughter] 

220.03 221.02 A: so 

221.80 225.69 A: i'm really upset with the whole [laughter] situation and 

226.04 233.16 A: [mn] i mean i i think that bush handled nine eleven pretty well but i think that his actions since then have been [mn] 

233.76 243.86 A: inappropriate and [noise] i really i expected that this would happen though as soon as he came into office it was like well he's got to pick up where his dad left off [mn] 

244.12 245.25 B: (( [mn] )) 

245.85 246.67 A: um 

246.21 247.84 B: (( do- do you think )) 

247.87 249.28 B: (( bush administration )) 

249.30 250.30 B: (( ah )) 

250.32 251.35 B: um 

251.86 259.96 B: just want to divert ah people's attention from the the the recessive economy 

260.19 271.86 B: because they don't they this this im- they don't seem to have um effective solutions to to this um economic economic situation now 

268.25 269.39 A: yeah 

272.16 273.22 B: [laughter] 

272.36 284.00 A: that's a really good possibility i'm i'm not sure what do you think about the whole thing since you're not even from here like [mn] are you just completely amazed at how he's handling everything like going god what an idiot or 

274.26 275.54 B: [laughter] 

284.39 285.91 A: [mn] what do you think about it 

288.78 289.34 B: (( [mn] )) 

289.81 291.39 B: i yeah i j- 

291.45 294.53 B: i agree with you that he he just 

294.74 297.14 B: um follow his father's 

297.20 298.95 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

297.47 300.09 B: (( with foreign policy um )) 

301.48 302.48 B: um 

303.03 305.20 B: (( military um )) 

305.60 306.42 A: [noise] 

307.43 309.52 B: (( how do you say construction )) 

310.07 311.58 A: mhm 

314.07 314.96 B: (( such stuff )) 

316.68 317.95 B: mm 

322.27 323.19 A: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

322.48 323.32 B: (( mm )) 

324.06 334.10 A: what do you think that we should do about it now like just obviously we already know what bush is going to do but [noise] what do you think a good solution for the whole situation is 

336.66 342.43 B: (( i would like um [laughter] actually ah the people )) 

342.56 348.84 B: can't do anything to change the situation to change the idea of the the 

345.95 347.00 A: yeah 

349.58 353.18 B: the [mn] the political sense i think 

351.61 352.66 A: mhm 

353.70 354.91 B: mm 

358.07 362.74 B: i i i would like to see a peace solution 

363.07 364.88 B: (( on this issue [mn] )) 

365.59 366.15 A: (( [mn] )) 

366.80 373.11 A: yeah i just wish that we could all like [mn] i don't know everything seemed fine 

367.56 369.46 B: (( yeah i )) 

373.69 377.68 A: before and i thought the that we were supposed to be concentrating on 

377.98 379.03 A: the whole 

379.45 384.18 A: issue from nine eleven [noise] and instead it totally turned to the iraq thing and 

385.81 386.98 A: i don't know 

387.95 389.52 B: yeah because 

390.11 392.09 B: war always brings 

392.11 393.21 B: um 

393.45 395.79 B: (( the sorrow for the that )) 

393.72 398.74 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

397.28 399.63 B: we we don't like to see 

399.88 404.12 B: and so some people just say the 

404.51 407.87 B: the war on iraq is just like the 

407.94 409.21 B: terrorism 

410.46 411.43 B: (( it's true )) 

411.09 412.75 A: (( [noise] mhm i don't know i think )) 

413.85 416.40 A: like even people in the u._s. i'm sure 

416.62 421.22 A: we don't hear about it all that much but i'm sure that people in the u._s. do things that are 

421.80 429.03 A: bad for other countries all the time i mean like shoot our government is almost like its own terrorist organization by the way that they 

429.01 439.99 A: handle things and push everybody else around when they don't like the way things work and that's what terrorist groups are doing they don't like the way things are going over here so they're pushing us around just as much as we push every other country around [mn] 

440.15 441.31 A: [noise] 

440.40 442.04 B: yes but 

443.91 452.20 B: but um [mn] i think america as a country will benefit from the war if if it succeed if um 

452.31 458.53 B: if um the american um government can take care of um [mn] um 

458.66 459.64 B: the 

460.00 468.43 B: government's ah the government of iraq and they can just they can just how do you say 

469.06 472.70 B: to sending the troop there and ah 

470.21 473.86 A: mhm 

474.29 480.39 B: they elect they they will help the ah iraqi p- ah iraq people to elect ah 

481.18 482.49 B: a president 

482.77 490.53 B: who who will ah follow the idea of american people ah no no am- american government 

482.82 484.32 A: (( mhm )) 

487.96 489.86 A: mhm 

490.62 491.97 B: (( and ah )) 

492.17 498.50 B: (( since american government has ah a power ah in iraq oh iraq in iraq )) 

494.31 497.61 A: (( mhm )) 

498.29 499.66 A: mhm 

498.71 502.49 B: and they can lower the oil price 

502.36 503.51 A: mhm 

503.05 508.30 B: and that's w- what b- mm bush administration wants i i think 

509.18 510.26 A: yeah 

510.06 512.83 B: and so the the oil 

513.32 515.53 B: price will go down 

515.70 518.57 B: [sigh] and ah maybe it will 

515.83 516.91 A: (( mhm )) 

519.20 523.06 B: maybe it it will encourage the economy 

523.51 524.94 B: (( i don't know so )) 

525.09 525.96 A: uh-huh 

529.29 530.03 A: (( mm )) 

529.83 531.12 B: (( and ah )) 

533.63 538.37 B: with this problem in oh iraq and south asia ah asia 

538.23 539.07 A: mhm 

538.71 540.77 B: and 

541.99 542.86 B: the 

543.19 548.04 B: (( bush a- a- the american government will ah get more power from )) 

548.10 549.82 B: that area 

549.82 551.31 A: mhm 

550.61 552.15 B: and 

552.90 554.05 B: then get 

554.14 558.33 B: economic benefits from that i [laughter] that's 

558.55 559.87 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

559.01 560.29 B: what i'm thinking 

562.43 573.50 A: [noise] [mn] i don't know really what else to say on the subject because [laughter] mo- mostly i'm just annoyed by it and i want everything to kind of stop and i 

567.35 568.70 B: [laughter] 

573.80 576.82 A: don't really have too much of another opinion after that 

576.43 577.71 B: [laughter] 

576.99 582.97 A: i think i am kind of close minded though just because i am a democrat and bush is a republican and 

580.85 581.63 B: (( mm )) 

583.42 587.62 A: [mn] so i automatically just [mn] don't like anything he's doing but 

588.39 589.31 B: (( ah )) 

592.41 607.32 B: you think ah the the tax ah how do i say it the ta- ah the revenue the tax revenue should allocate to education or to ah healthcare othe- other than military 

607.52 614.23 A: yes i think that we spend way too much money on military stuff considering 

613.13 615.09 B: yeah yeah 

614.19 625.48 A: that the schools like i'm in oklahoma and the schools here in oklahoma the high schools and stuff are having to have their hall lights out because [mn] we don't have enough money for the schools to pay the electric bills and so 

624.67 625.44 B: (( [mn] )) 

625.57 628.35 A: why should we be spending a billion dollars on 

628.47 636.02 A: weapons and planes and stuff when people that [mn] in the united states don't even have the money to be going to [noise] a decent school 

635.79 637.85 B: (( right right )) 

638.21 639.34 A: so in 

639.72 647.81 A: like my tuition's being raised and we're just in a bad pla- like our whole economy's just completely in a bad place 

643.20 643.92 B: mm 

647.86 651.61 A: and it's because [laughter] we're spending so much money on 

651.73 653.88 A: unnecessary things 

653.23 655.83 B: [laughter] 

656.74 660.25 A: i don't know i just think the whole thin- like 

660.34 666.71 A: we shouldn't be involved in this at all i don't think [mn] that if he has weapons [sigh] 

666.80 668.82 A: that he's really going to use 'em 

668.95 670.14 B: mhm 

669.02 676.50 A: unless he feels threatened and what we're doing right now is pushing him to feel threatened and so we're asking him to use 'em pretty much [noise] 

678.92 680.03 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

684.38 686.07 A: i don't know [laughter] 

685.30 686.47 B: [laughter] 

690.17 693.48 B: (( do you know what ah how long did they )) 

694.50 695.62 A: (( [mn] what )) 

695.62 700.40 B: do you know h- how long we should um [lipsmack] talk on this topic 

700.64 709.86 A: they ah should tell us when our time's up that we have thirty seconds left to say goodbye or something but they haven't done it yet i'm trying to look and see how long we've been on the phone 

710.24 711.51 A: but i can't tell

713.88 718.18 B: we can't change our topic right [laughter] 

716.14 716.77 A: (( long )) 

716.84 719.89 A: yeah and they'll just hear the same talk topic the whole time i just
