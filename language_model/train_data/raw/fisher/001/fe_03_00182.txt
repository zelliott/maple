53.44 53.75 B: yeah 

54.07 57.89 A: yeah so and i i think too a lot of things about like 

58.45 62.00 A: the holidays are just you know the traditions that you 

62.36 68.32 A: celebrate and stuff i don't really like how christmas has become really commercialized and you know all about the 

68.94 73.87 A: spending the big money and stuff like that you know but i think there are a lot of things that you can do to make it 

74.49 76.99 A: more special and meaningful and stuff like that 

77.19 79.66 B: yeah i think it's valuable for families and i think 

80.05 81.52 B: commercialism is 

82.96 84.13 B: isn't good for ah 

85.10 86.27 B: the family as a unit of 

86.39 87.63 B: society anyway so 

87.42 88.48 A: yeah 

88.61 90.20 A: yeah do you have like 

90.76 96.40 A: memories from christmases in the past that have made you like prefer that holiday or 

97.25 97.92 B: um 

98.82 99.15 B: i 

99.85 100.87 B: i guess 

101.91 103.34 B: i guess so um

111.90 112.54 A: mhm 

112.57 113.76 B: so what about you 

114.00 117.19 A: yeah i think so i mean and 

117.64 122.68 A: especially like with christmas i come from a pretty big family i have three sisters and a brother 

121.53 127.01 B: well if you guys are (( )) you're probably a pretty big family 

122.86 123.31 A: um 

129.62 130.07 B: yeah 

135.08 136.37 A: i remember 

136.56 139.26 A: the christmases and s- you know an- my parents would 

139.36 140.75 A: put out like 

148.40 148.84 A: (( )) 

158.73 160.97 A: to go out there you know they're like its not morning yet

169.81 172.84 A: a special like christmas punch with the dinner and 

172.95 174.23 A: having the turkey and 

173.27 173.61 B: yeah 

175.59 176.86 A: stuff like that 

177.58 179.47 A: so what do you think about like 

179.71 181.42 A: creating a holiday like i- 

181.62 182.76 A: the question said 

182.93 186.10 B: yeah i created one i don't know about the i mean i cou- could see 

186.63 187.38 B: like with it 

187.69 189.68 B: within my family some day like 

190.03 192.47 B: cel- celebrating something that you know 

193.25 194.49 B: something from either 

195.85 200.39 B: either my parents past or my grandparents past but i think the whole thing about 

198.81 201.07 A: uh-huh a (( significant )) family day 

201.46 205.16 B: yeah i think there would have to be some tradition behind it otherwise huh 

205.59 206.93 B: the holiday is kind of pointless 

207.26 211.08 A: yeah well and it seems like we have a lot of holidays already 

210.87 211.85 B: yeah 

211.60 217.14 A: you know and i have a hard time celebrating the ones we have i haven't done any christmas shopping yet 

217.47 218.11 B: yeah 

218.15 219.66 A: so um 

219.88 224.34 A: yeah an- yeah an- so i don't know i don't know i can't say that i would like 

224.66 227.38 A: create a holiday other than you know 

226.82 228.67 B: especially a national one yeah 

228.10 232.86 A: (( )) right yeah yeah but i think you know 

233.19 237.41 A: there is a lot that i could do to celebrate the holidays that we have more 

237.66 238.04 A: you know 

238.44 239.30 A: fully or 

239.66 241.15 A: you know in a better way 

241.41 241.86 B: yeah 

242.06 242.71 A: yeah

263.05 264.28 A: stuff like that 

264.64 266.62 A: so it tends to be you know 

266.71 267.30 A: pretty 

267.87 268.44 A: simple
