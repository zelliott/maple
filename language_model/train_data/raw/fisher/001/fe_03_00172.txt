21.22 21.83 A: holiday 

21.91 23.68 B: yes my favorite holiday is halloween 

23.98 24.71 B: definitely 

24.32 25.04 A: oh really 

24.91 34.19 B: yeah and it's not it really has nothing to do with the actual holiday itself it's just um no it's just the time of year i don't even like to dress up um 

25.40 25.81 A: wow 

28.91 30.39 A: just an excuse to dress up 

34.83 36.99 B: favorite favorite favorite month of the year 

37.23 37.71 A: oh 

39.19 40.29 A: well that's really nice 

42.56 50.55 B: the weather around that time of year like the last week of october is just so crisp and nice and it's not too cold it's like perfect 

46.78 47.16 A: yeah 

48.60 49.05 A: yeah 

49.48 50.16 A: exactly 

50.26 53.56 A: i love that time of year also but i think um 

57.07 58.39 B: right 

64.01 67.74 A: all my aunts and uncles would come in from all over the world and there always lots 

68.06 72.22 A: people in the house and everybody was in a good mood at least for one day 

69.11 69.59 B: right 

72.36 75.49 A: which was really nice so 

81.69 88.59 B: usually one of the most memorable holidays for me like i can probably remember every christmas and who's been there and what's happened but um 

83.56 84.70 A: mm yeah 

88.73 90.53 B: i don't know there always seems to be something 

90.83 98.38 B: tinged with sadness about it i guess maybe because uh for so many years i guess after my mother's mother died who lived with us 

92.73 93.32 A: really 

97.23 97.68 A: uh huh 

98.16 98.52 A: yeah 

98.53 105.86 B: christmas or i my mom was never quite the same on christmas for about ten years and so that was a lot of my growing up so 

101.23 101.89 A: mhm 

102.80 103.70 A: yeah 

105.24 107.06 A: yeah it's 

105.95 111.78 B: but um and it wasn't christmas day was always fine it was just the days leading up to and the days afterward 

115.40 123.52 A: i always have all this anticipation like oh it's going to be so great and everyone's going to be there and you know i like all the traditions i like the tree i like hang- 

122.19 122.70 B: right 

123.69 127.92 A: stockings and all that stuff i love waking up on christmas morning and having a fire in the fire place 

128.10 128.55 B: right 

128.50 128.96 A: but 

129.23 135.13 A: it's always a let down inevitably because i think i build it up so much in my head but 

131.34 132.49 B: yes 

134.32 136.68 B: i think yeah i think i do too 

135.31 137.36 A: i i re- i love it 

137.78 145.23 A: i love all the preparation for it and the build up to it and the anticipation and then you know the actual event is always oh yeah right 

139.70 140.04 B: mhm 

145.33 147.23 A: i forgot about all this part 

148.10 148.49 A: so 

154.85 155.27 A: right 

156.50 160.93 B: uh home they're coming home on the twentieth so it's totally up to me to sort of 

161.42 172.54 B: to set the holiday atmosphere for christmas so i'm really actually really excited i'm going to get a tree this weekend and i'm going to go break into the attic and get all the ornaments and i plan on like 

162.70 164.25 A: wow wow 

166.22 167.82 A: that's that's really cool 

172.67 180.85 B: just putting up all the decorations and stuff and then like stuff that my father has always done or my mom and dad did together and then all the kids would come home and now it's like 

178.14 178.71 A: yeah 

181.04 182.42 A: oh that's really cool actually 

181.08 185.31 B: you know i'm doing it and they're coming back to that so i'm really excited 

183.54 184.97 A: it's weird because 

185.22 188.44 A: i bought i bought this house like three years ago and 

188.60 198.73 A: every year i've had to decide whether to get a tree or not and i'm usually not actually there on christmas day because i'm go visit my parents but 

192.92 193.42 B: right 

196.39 197.05 B: right 

206.70 207.15 B: right 

208.34 209.91 A: um this past weekend i put up lights 

211.21 212.02 B: nice 

211.83 219.79 A: i you know i've been trying to get to home depot or something to buy a wreath but i'm not going to do a tree this year because the cats always end up eating the 

215.89 216.39 B: right 

220.11 226.09 B: well that's the fun part oh i guess if they get sick that's not that fun 

220.45 229.95 A: needles and getting sick yeah so it's no fun so we're supposed to decided on some holiday that we want to create and and uh 

228.74 229.34 B: um 

230.05 231.17 B: gosh i have no idea 

230.37 230.89 A: celebrate 

231.74 235.31 B: talking more about christmas um i don't know what would i 

233.18 239.36 A: yeah christmas is nice i don't actually think we need anymore holidays i just think we need more vacation in general 

243.98 245.81 B: (( spread them out better )) off the year 

245.78 248.81 A: yeah exactly they're all clustered in the winter 

247.01 247.32 B: so 

248.71 250.51 B: yeah exactly and um 

249.97 250.56 A: yeah 

250.72 251.27 B: like 

251.48 255.23 B: i wish there were more in like january or february or at least maybe we should get off on 

255.34 259.62 B: valentines day or something although that's an awful holiday but 

259.23 263.26 A: yeah valentines day is pure evil as far as i'm concerned but 

260.60 261.70 B: it is 

262.61 270.58 B: no me too but it should definitely be a day off just to sit at home and mope if nothing else 

266.20 266.68 A: yeah 

268.53 278.01 A: yeah yeah yeah i think it would be good if something in the spring around like easter or or whatever it doesn't have to be easter but if something like that fell on a weekday 

274.53 274.87 B: right 

277.99 278.52 B: right 

278.52 285.67 A: it'd be nice to have like a two day weekend or a two day holiday before a weekend sometime in in march or april 

279.72 280.41 B: exactly 

283.55 284.08 B: yes 

285.41 290.24 B: that actually that's a great idea to have another two day or like four day weekend 

289.98 290.72 A: right right 

290.39 292.64 B: at some point or later in the year like to sort of 

291.17 293.31 A: something along the lines of thanksgiving 

292.98 299.43 B: yeah exactly and um i know because i was thinking about i'm trying to figure out when i can go visit my parents again and 

293.86 295.24 A: mhm 

304.15 305.01 A: right 

307.64 308.99 A: yeah exactly 

308.25 309.15 B: there really 

309.25 314.45 B: aren't that many a four day weekend would be perfect because then i could take two extra days off and then it would make a 

311.45 311.79 A: right 

314.59 316.93 B: trans atlantic trip worth it 

316.01 317.31 A: exactly 

317.05 319.67 B: but um just going for like three days isn't worth it 

326.58 326.92 B: right 

327.59 330.13 A: cultural tradition of it being ok 

330.51 334.68 A: for everyone to just kind of shut down for a couple of weeks at the end of the summer 

334.64 336.59 B: wait you think it's better if that's not o._k. 

336.53 345.63 A: no i wish that were o._k. because i think everyone tries to squeeze their vacations in sometime in the summer i mean in europe it's just 

337.07 337.51 B: oh you 

338.42 340.35 B: right sort of like europe 

343.99 344.52 B: right 

345.82 348.94 A: you know people just know that you don't do anything in august 

348.55 349.60 B: right exactly 

349.18 352.94 A: you just take holiday and relax it's like so civilized 

350.48 352.39 B: the whole month 

352.83 357.22 B: actually um my brother just got married in september my older brother and his uh 

353.15 353.91 A: so 

356.43 356.80 A: yeah 

357.89 362.64 B: bachelor was in the south of france because he used to live in nice for a long time and so um 

359.80 360.21 A: uh huh 

362.80 367.94 B: that's where most of his friends are sort of concentrated and uh i went to visit him and um 

364.54 365.77 A: wow 

368.29 368.79 B: the 

369.07 371.02 B: literally it was unbelievable like 

371.32 380.15 B: the whole entire country of france had descended on the south coast and you just you couldn't' even move in the streets but i don't know 

374.62 375.94 A: right 

377.72 378.31 A: yeah 

378.94 379.43 A: wow 

380.37 382.76 B: but i just that you reminded me of um 

382.61 383.28 A: so th- 

383.07 389.81 B: just having a dedicated month when no work is expected to get done i mean even if you are at work like you know it's 

384.61 385.94 A: that would be my holiday 

386.99 387.85 A: exactly 

388.94 389.26 A: right 

391.22 392.00 B: nothing important 

392.26 393.90 B: expected of me 

393.30 398.31 A: that's the holiday i want i want the three week you know mid august 

398.62 400.04 A: vacation so 

406.09 412.31 B: (( )) except that i don't even like the summer that much so i kind of like the holidays in the winter 

412.39 412.66 B: but 

412.69 413.68 A: mm 

412.96 414.38 B: i don't know having more time off 

417.92 418.22 B: just 

419.99 428.66 A: childhood associations with school starting back up or something and so you want to have some kind of break that marks the transition between the new 

421.46 422.88 B: yeah i guess the (( school )) 

422.98 424.15 B: right exactly 

426.79 431.89 B: right that's funny that you say that because even though i've been working now for a few years and i've been out of school 

428.88 429.47 A: the new year 

432.02 435.06 B: i still consider september the beginning of the year 

434.78 435.68 A: exactly 

435.17 436.57 B: it's really funny 

435.91 440.63 A: exactly i don't know i wonder how much of it has to do with working in an academic environment or 

440.34 441.19 B: right maybe 

440.91 442.63 A: something but yeah 

443.09 443.67 A: so 

443.34 443.72 B: (( )) 

444.18 444.86 A: so christmas 

445.13 445.65 A: i 

445.80 456.16 A: i'm debating still whether to um how long to be visiting my parent so it's always this c- every year it's this constant thing because it's like 

448.20 448.72 B: mhm 

451.52 452.09 B: right 

456.32 459.03 A: you know there's always that stressful 

459.40 460.64 A: component to it 

460.64 461.09 B: yes 

460.91 471.31 A: know you just become a child again when you're back in your parents house right so you know i i want to maximize my time with family and i never get to see my sisters it'll be so great but 

462.71 464.08 B: yes exactly 

469.36 469.73 B: right 

471.70 479.98 A: uh and it's a long drive also i mean they're ten hours away so it's long drive and you you don't want to just go for two days or something but um 

475.04 475.77 B: right or 

480.17 482.95 A: too much togetherness is a is a bad thing 

481.60 486.71 B: uh yeah (( )) and it's also 

483.52 484.05 A: i think 

485.24 485.63 A: yeah 

487.11 490.00 B: for me and this is something that's been frustrating me a lot like i 

490.48 493.56 B: i think i've grown up a lot in the past year and a half two years 

493.73 494.42 B: and 

494.94 497.47 B: i'm not with my family so much that 

497.13 497.57 A: mm 

497.57 498.58 B: they can see 

499.04 504.22 B: how much i've changed and grown up and it really frustrates me when we're all together because they sort of 

500.09 501.14 A: yeah yeah 

504.35 515.94 B: you know treat me still like you know the screwed up younger brother like is a total mess and that too many of days of that i can't stand although i love seeing them but i just can't 

510.03 510.81 A: exactly 

511.03 511.64 A: yeah 

513.56 514.20 A: oh i know 

514.63 519.14 A: i've i've realize actually that i have a better time with my family if i limit 

519.35 520.25 A: my interactions 

519.46 519.83 B: right 

520.35 522.48 A: with them to just a couple of days 

522.10 524.72 B: see i i have a better time with them if i 

524.89 533.83 B: it doesn't matter how long i stay but if i do them just one at a time like one brother at a time or my sister or just my parents and and uh but
