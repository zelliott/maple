59.88 63.16 A: actually finding something else and maybe i'm overly skeptical 

63.57 64.10 B: right 

64.31 65.28 A: of what's going on 

65.79 66.29 A: um 

67.26 68.13 A: but i feel like 

69.16 70.64 A: a lot of it might be 

72.20 75.38 A: trying to cover up some other investigations that are going on 

75.94 78.94 A: that might be more controversial regarding 

79.38 80.31 A: terrorism or 

86.82 87.21 B: right 

88.00 89.17 B: well you any more 

89.66 90.52 B: there is so much more 

90.81 92.67 B: mistrust in government than every before 

93.28 94.20 B: just because ah 

94.92 96.50 B: it becomes such a convoluted game 

96.88 97.47 A: mhm 

97.18 97.60 B: um 

98.01 101.48 B: everybody seems to be in bed with somebody else and then 

102.01 107.46 B: that spurs something has to happen so offset that deal and yati yati yata and so 

108.15 108.99 B: yeah it gets 

109.12 111.06 B: it gets pretty crazy plus you know i mean 

112.15 113.74 B: they have regulations and then 

114.28 114.68 B: um 

115.48 117.76 B: you know they any kind of standard or anything like that 

118.39 118.83 B: um 

119.23 121.55 B: there is more than one way to skin a cat so to speak 

121.69 122.23 A: mhm 

122.28 122.75 B: um 

123.27 123.75 B: so 

124.03 125.20 B: there might be standard that 

125.76 128.20 B: sets forth a really clear stipulation that 

128.59 130.66 B: there could be a loophole there somehow some way 

131.23 131.68 A: right 

131.90 132.45 B: so ah 

133.49 135.17 A: what do you think about the eh 

136.33 138.73 A: twelve thousand page document is it 

138.80 139.49 B: yeah 

140.09 141.97 B: oh god that's the oldest trick in the book isn't it 

142.34 143.94 B: what do they call that the snow call 

144.29 144.75 B: where 

144.88 151.17 B: where there something like that when they bombard everyone with paperwork and files lawyers like to do that you know 

151.14 151.61 A: right 

151.70 153.45 B: and they are getting ready to go into a case that like 

154.01 158.98 A: and i think it it spouts everything in this aura of mystique that we all have to 

154.14 154.65 B: some of us 

159.09 162.46 A: you know that the answer is in the twelve thousand pages and 

162.17 162.62 B: right 

162.72 163.37 A: just by that 

163.47 165.23 A: the sheer volume of it that that 

165.35 167.73 A: you know that alone is enough to eh 

168.40 170.09 A: wire up i think a lot of people 

170.93 171.24 B: yeah 

171.21 174.97 A: twelve thousand pages it's twelve thousand bombs and you know 

174.53 175.37 B: oh sure 

175.48 177.04 B: sure yeah oh gosh 

177.14 183.37 B: what yeah yeah that's funny that you should say that i mean they is so much information they tell us and there so much information they don't 

183.88 184.34 B: um 

184.68 186.02 B: you have to wonder you know 

186.69 189.03 B: everything i guess because i'm just so skeptical of 

189.68 191.73 B: politicians and government in general that 

191.94 193.83 B: when i hear that you know they are saying oh 

194.03 194.56 B: twelve p- 

194.75 196.83 B: twelve thousand page document or whatever it was 

197.19 197.62 A: yes 

197.19 198.51 B: that's like you know uh 

198.83 201.82 B: why are they telling us this i mean i understand they are trying to eh 

202.63 204.98 B: throw out you know the weight magnitude of the 

205.18 206.13 B: situation but 

206.51 207.80 B: on another level it's like 

208.99 210.74 B: they are all just trying to spear your 

211.44 211.91 B: um 

212.09 212.71 B: support 

213.54 215.86 B: for the the government and what they are doing 

215.28 215.87 A: mhm 

216.45 217.32 B: the u._s. government 

217.52 218.09 A: right right 

218.00 219.30 B: um against iraq 

218.40 220.28 A: that's being productive at least in the 

219.96 220.90 B: exactly 

220.39 222.09 A: terms of paper 

221.64 224.65 B: yeah like they are saying what kind of trickery they are doing now 

225.23 226.07 B: so yeah 

225.43 227.26 A: but it seems to me that the eh 

227.56 230.49 A: the eh eh i haven't spoken to anyone who isn't skeptical 

230.97 231.44 B: yeah 

231.19 231.78 A: um 

232.12 234.93 A: and i'm surprised that there seems to be so much wide- 

235.17 236.77 A: widespread support for just 

237.63 241.05 A: going in and putting our nose in wherever we want to 

241.66 242.28 A: um 

242.80 245.27 A: i just don't know where it's coming from i don't know what pocket 

246.53 247.17 A: of 

247.46 248.45 A: society eh 

248.55 248.96 A: you know 

250.25 254.54 A: we are so supportive because i find that the trend is to be skeptical and more of the news that i 

254.64 256.02 A: see is 

256.17 256.64 A: eh ih 

256.89 258.49 A: pig backing news about 

259.31 261.34 A: potential was with iraq is 

261.93 263.06 A: news about 

263.48 266.82 A: people who are you know anti-war protesting and 

267.04 267.91 A: on going 

268.50 271.08 A: and growing of people who are just not 

271.25 272.14 A: a lot eh 

273.38 275.36 A: in agreement with it and then if it seems that that 

275.50 276.36 A: going along 

276.64 279.07 A: with it with the media frenzy as well it's sort of like 

279.19 280.49 A: the popularization of 

281.15 281.40 A: of 

281.53 285.16 A: critique of the government it's it's a new trend for me 

285.43 285.89 B: yeah 

286.23 287.16 B: yeah i hear you 

287.74 289.16 B: yeah it almost seems like ah 

290.61 291.44 B: well anymore 

291.73 293.81 B: in in opinion it seems like 

294.43 295.67 B: and i know this has probably been 

296.05 297.90 B: the way for for a very long time but 

298.21 301.28 B: you know big business runs government so it's like you said you know 

301.40 302.66 B: the average individual 

303.01 303.54 A: mhm 

303.33 305.14 B: does has a totally different opinion 

305.48 307.73 B: than big business you know big business has 

307.92 308.38 B: um 

308.58 311.41 B: global interest so off course they want to make sure that 

311.93 316.93 B: everything stays smooth sailing and you know they are going to put money in the right pocket 

313.89 314.39 A: mhm 

317.06 318.04 B: dissent and the other but 

318.42 318.84 B: um 

319.41 320.83 B: it's really disheartening for me it's it's 

321.04 322.59 B: almost frightening really 

323.21 324.01 B: the you know 

324.12 328.85 B: what our nation has been founded upon is slowly being lost in my opinion 

329.04 329.55 A: right 

329.50 330.42 B: to you know 

331.80 332.24 B: aha 

332.99 334.33 B: large dollars and 

335.35 336.12 B: big business 

335.50 335.99 A: yeah 

336.44 336.94 B: what not 

336.65 336.97 A: and 

337.34 341.03 A: and the whole multi-national corporation term just means 

342.34 351.39 A: it it's sort of anational at this point it doesn't it doesn't belong to or support any group or nation it it sort of exists outside of the concept of nation 

352.44 352.77 B: right 

353.20 355.61 A: corporation so it not something that you 

355.83 356.94 A: no matter where where it 

357.04 357.63 A: stays 

358.13 359.82 A: it's a network that sort of ignites 

362.86 363.53 A: almost 

364.10 367.02 B: yeah well you you're dead on i mean um 

368.15 370.46 B: the company that i work for is a 

370.79 371.89 B: has lots of eh 

372.54 373.37 B: eh factories 

373.65 374.17 B: globally 

374.87 377.85 B: so you know we're constantly see people transfer in out 

378.11 379.72 B: what not yati yati yada 

380.88 382.25 B: it gets very uncomfortable 

382.35 383.68 B: in some situations like 

383.79 384.53 B: when you hear about 

385.08 385.95 B: problems and 

386.08 387.46 B: afghanistan or whatever 

387.54 387.97 A: mhm 

387.74 389.48 B: um well problems in india 

389.82 397.94 B: you know our indian friends were like you know you're walking a a fine line you know you want to be supportive of because they've been you're friends and yet on the other hand it's like 

394.26 394.73 A: right 

398.98 402.48 B: you got the whole p._c. thing politically correct see you don't want to like 

400.72 401.22 A: right 

403.48 411.86 B: talk too deep because you don't want to put somebody in an uncomfortable position and yet yeah it's getting really really more and more complex trying to 

412.32 414.78 B: to deal with these things because you know we have so many more people 

415.11 416.99 B: around us that you know i mean 

417.13 419.13 B: the united states has always been a diverse nation 

419.86 421.35 B: understandably so but 

421.60 422.02 B: um 

422.61 424.23 B: just seems to be getting more intense to me 

424.43 424.94 A: mhm 

426.18 427.16 A: yeah there is that 

427.30 430.12 A: heightened awareness but it's not going hand in hand with 

430.98 431.54 A: um 

432.25 434.57 A: acceptance of diversity at all it 

436.36 438.08 A: kind off having the opposite effect 

438.45 439.26 B: exactly 

439.71 440.88 B: yeah it's really sad 

439.73 440.27 A: and 

440.51 441.73 A: with or without reason it 

442.18 443.05 A: it's what is happening 

443.44 443.80 B: right 

444.86 445.95 B: well i mean it's 

446.84 450.12 B: you know big business wants to look out for its pocketbooks 

450.38 451.72 B: and what not and 

452.23 452.73 B: us 

452.91 453.88 B: average folk 

454.20 456.43 B: want to look out for our families and our interests you know 

456.97 457.52 A: mhm 

457.16 457.63 B: so ah 

458.37 459.51 B: yeah there is a lot of eh 

460.20 466.01 B: it's like an onion [laugh] you can keep peeling the layers look at it all kinds of different ways 

461.28 462.61 A: yeah 

463.01 464.45 A: peel it away 

466.02 468.49 A: what do you think the eh 

469.34 473.11 A: the responsibility should be if any if something is found that is 

473.83 475.82 A: dangerous on a global scale 

477.12 478.59 A: i mean in terms of the united s- 

478.77 481.01 A: states as a world power do you think that that 

481.42 483.26 A: a role that we should play 

484.81 486.24 A: that 

488.37 495.09 B: that's a tough one um suppose that it all depends on the circumstances and i don't mean that to be like a cope out cope out answer 

495.22 496.84 B: but i mean 

497.76 498.34 B: eh 

498.78 501.55 B: or you could go back to vietnam i mean that was a farce 

501.97 502.49 A: mhm 

502.29 503.47 B: there is no reason why 

504.55 506.13 B: we have to get involved in my opinion 

506.26 506.70 A: mhm 

506.64 507.05 B: em 

507.52 508.78 B: but then you look at ah 

509.24 510.33 B: some of the more recent 

511.21 512.17 B: um happenings 

512.34 512.85 B: and 

514.14 515.38 B: you almost wonder you know 

515.89 517.32 B: if we hadn't gotten involved 

517.69 519.60 B: in some of these other skirmishes way back when 

519.96 521.22 B: you know would it be 

520.00 521.11 A: what would happen now 

521.92 526.68 B: what would the world be like today what what would well you know world powers changing hands too 

527.01 528.92 B: you know the u._s. is not necessarily 

529.73 530.98 B: strongest nation anymore 

531.10 531.58 A: right 

531.70 532.85 B: there are other nations that are 

533.27 533.65 B: um 

534.33 535.69 B: very healthy contenders so 

536.02 537.63 B: i think it's a very delicate line 

536.40 538.38 A: thank god give it a break 

538.50 538.94 B: huh 

538.86 541.38 A: because i think i have time for a break 

541.44 542.28 B: oh yeah 

541.94 542.80 A: take the pressure of 

543.09 543.68 B: for sure 

545.11 547.56 B: yeah but you know on on the full side of that though 

547.93 549.90 B: i think the states has so many enemies
