79.67 82.92 B: well hum my girlfriend is a spanish teacher 

83.08 84.39 A: so maybe that's 

83.83 86.64 B: and she i don't know if she gets emails or something

88.87 92.21 B: i know she says she's talked with several people that are you know 

92.88 95.97 B: one he was a german professor so he's obviously involved in 

96.15 96.57 A: right 

96.78 97.92 B: linguistics 

96.88 97.58 A: okay 

97.76 99.61 A: yea so i wondered if there was some 

99.79 101.87 A: greater connection that's good 

102.96 103.47 A: so 

103.77 105.46 A: arms inspection in iraq 

105.06 105.90 B: i know 

106.18 108.06 A: that's a heavy duty topic 

108.02 109.02 B: i guess so 

110.21 110.66 B: huh 

110.86 112.21 B: i don't know 

112.88 114.60 B: i know one of the questions the 

115.05 115.35 B: the 

116.38 117.79 B: thing asked was 

118.12 123.21 B: what if anything should america do in disarming iraq 

123.22 123.78 A: mm 

124.20 124.95 B: i guess that 

125.19 126.75 B: if there's any 

127.20 128.70 B: good steps that that i 

128.91 130.86 B: know of or learned you know 

131.66 135.33 B: is that go through united nations first off 

135.66 136.08 A: right 

136.20 137.28 B: it seems to be 

138.13 140.45 B: get calm and peaceful ground to go on 

141.74 143.90 B: way to with 

144.08 146.41 A: yea i agree with you i think huh 

147.55 148.22 A: going 

148.48 152.40 A: going to the united nations and have them being the governing body seems like the most 

153.61 155.62 A: sensible reasonable way to approach it 

156.34 161.01 A: mean they've managed to get those arms inspectors in there now and iraq seems to be 

162.35 164.72 A: taking it a little bit seriously this time around 

164.81 165.27 B: yea 

166.03 168.61 A: yea i guess in the clinton administration they didn't 

168.96 171.85 A: take it too seriously or they kept throwing them out or 

171.93 172.41 B: yea 

172.92 175.46 A: they huh iraq was giving them the old run around 

176.35 177.02 B: i hum 

177.96 179.60 B: but i defiantly think that we need to huh 

180.25 181.67 B: get iraq disarmed or 

182.38 182.87 B: you know 

184.09 185.99 B: change the way they're 

187.30 188.87 B: there's no doubt in my mind that they 

189.75 191.26 B: you know front and 

192.38 195.73 B: and are involved in terrorist activities i think so 

195.71 200.36 A: yea i think defiantly saddam hussein is a bad guy 

200.42 201.23 B: oh yea 

201.25 204.68 A: i think that's for sure i think huh i don't know if they have 

205.51 208.31 A: i'm not convinced that they have nuclear 

208.99 210.19 A: weapon power 

211.01 212.14 A: i read something 

213.02 215.38 A: gosh some report that said that iraq was 

216.43 218.63 A: less of a threat now then they we're in the eighties 

218.91 219.34 A: when 

219.68 220.37 A: george 

220.65 222.54 A: you know know senior first went in 

221.33 221.70 B: right 

223.45 225.50 A: so i was curious to hear about that 

225.79 228.13 A: that george junior would be making such a 

228.43 229.68 A: big fuss now 

230.64 232.29 A: when some reports are saying that 

232.51 234.12 A: really iraq was less 

234.62 235.43 A: less of a threat 

235.76 236.09 B: yea 

236.56 239.70 A: that makes me wonder if george junior is just huh 

240.22 241.17 A: a warmonger 

241.65 242.09 B: yup 

242.17 244.66 A: and wants to raise his 

245.37 248.88 A: his huh public opinion by getting into a war with iraq 

248.71 249.19 B: yea 

249.63 251.16 B: i defiantly think that that 

252.27 252.81 B: the 

253.03 255.29 B: that is a situation he's in or 

255.42 257.44 B: or sort of put himself into 

257.17 257.68 A: yea 

257.62 260.71 B: you know after september eleventh he kept going 

260.85 269.72 B: they kept hearing quotes of him saying we're going to get these guys as quick and fast as we can and we're going to do what ever we can to fight terrorism and 

269.98 272.90 B: and get rid of terrorism because that's the underline problem and 

273.53 275.20 B: and i kept hearing him say that and 

275.72 276.89 B: i think all in all that 

277.59 279.41 B: in his heart he is you know 

280.22 281.48 B: he's a hard nose guy and 

281.73 284.83 B: he would rather go to war i would would think than 

284.96 285.78 B: then huh 

286.41 287.19 B: seems to be 

286.41 290.53 A: that's it i get the impression i mean i'm not a big fan of george bush but huh 

291.51 292.91 A: i thought he handled the huh 

293.10 298.18 A: aftermath of september eleventh pretty well i mean i didn't like that part of the speech where he 

296.38 296.70 B: yea 

298.95 301.82 A: talked about the access of evil i thought that was a little bit 

302.69 305.07 A: shallow and i'm not real sophisticated 

305.32 305.76 B: yea 

306.24 306.88 A: but huh 

307.76 312.68 A: but you know i mean i think the domestic side of how he handled september eleventh was good and 

313.08 313.73 A: you know and 

314.89 315.85 A: certain 

316.41 316.97 A: you know 

317.42 320.65 A: way he presented himself and the u._s. i think was all right 

321.81 328.84 A: yea this whole business of going to war with iraq with no support from the united nations i think is a little scary 

330.17 333.50 A: i mean nobody wants to go to war war is a horrible thing and why would you 

333.82 335.04 B: sure and it's 

335.74 339.09 B: beyond the fact that it's a horrible inhumane thing it's 

339.57 340.04 B: (( )) 

340.89 345.74 A: expensive and you know course the flip side of that is it will do good things for the economy 

345.75 346.25 B: right 

346.28 347.00 A: which you can't 

347.46 349.13 A: you can't ignore that 

349.24 349.57 A: that 

351.61 352.27 A: thinking about 

352.73 352.99 B: yup 

353.14 356.07 A: you know his capital goes up his huh 

357.28 359.37 A: what the american people if he 

360.29 366.73 A: you know if the economy goes up he'll probably get another four years 

367.74 370.07 A: right now when what is huh 

370.79 371.48 A: i saw 

371.81 373.32 A: gore on t._v. last night 

374.12 375.09 A: starting his little 

375.22 377.99 A: pre-campaign t._v. book tour 

378.06 378.54 B: mm 

379.29 381.11 A: you know he's thinking about reelection 

381.76 382.50 B: oh yea 

382.56 385.64 A: so your sure he gets got to be sure that george w. 

386.05 387.40 A: thinking about reelection 

387.27 389.65 B: politics plays into a lot of it 

389.71 390.69 A: it does it 

390.35 390.84 B: sure 

391.11 392.16 A: sad i huh 

393.24 394.37 A: i think hum 

394.81 397.89 A: i think if the arms inspectors can go in and do their job 

398.88 400.12 A: we'll be really impressive 

401.04 403.32 A: i think that they are up against the huge 

403.91 405.30 B: oh huge 

404.45 404.79 A: huge 

404.95 405.92 A: force 

405.96 407.42 B: oh i guess so right 

407.90 408.37 B: huh 

408.64 409.58 B: my grandparents 

409.76 410.90 B: told me that they heard 

411.78 412.42 B: our huh 

412.75 415.02 B: just a reporter or something saying that 

415.74 420.40 B: so of these biological that iraq has are in the back of motor homes 

420.59 421.64 A: oh my god yea 

421.40 422.47 B: huh trailer that only go- 

422.60 423.78 B: across iraq 

423.95 425.29 B: you know iraq and 

425.09 425.76 A: they're moving 

425.84 429.86 B: in on that's the size of california or something like that 

430.15 431.37 B: you know huge and 

432.06 433.37 B: and now how can you 

433.70 435.06 B: it's needle in a hay stack 

435.87 439.25 A: yea yea and you know i read something where there was a 

436.40 436.92 B: you know 

439.50 442.11 A: huh or maybe it was a (( m._t._r. )) report i heard huh 

442.92 444.38 A: some guy who was a former 

444.65 445.28 A: inspector 

446.02 446.58 A: u._s. 

446.83 451.87 A: citizen who was over there in iraq the first time around during the eighties or nineties 

452.81 454.67 A: must have been the nineties and he huh 

456.15 460.49 A: had some you know he got to know these guys so you know you form a relation ship with a person 

461.05 462.79 A: you'd see them every day for six months 

463.63 466.76 A: and one of the iraqi officials 

466.95 468.01 A: but something 

468.11 468.39 A: (( )) 

469.16 470.41 A: about some 

470.54 473.07 A: war head or something that you know needed 

473.74 475.09 A: that had been a secret 

475.77 478.83 A: and you know let it slip and so the arms inspector 

478.96 482.98 A: investigated then the next thing they find out the guy was executed 

483.21 483.91 B: oh wow 

484.44 485.92 A: yea can you imagine the man had his 

486.02 488.53 A: arms inspectors over there are up against 

488.66 490.77 A: the fear of you know their 

490.88 491.58 B: i know 

492.07 494.09 B: there's going to be no da- 

494.27 496.12 B: hard pressed to find defectors 

496.65 497.06 A: yea 

497.04 499.74 B: people that are giving up saddam and his secrets 

500.28 503.04 A: right cause god forbid your going to die your self 

502.93 506.81 B: oh darn right yea if it's that way than nobody's going to talk 

506.70 510.47 A: right right it's hot to you wonder what is it they're really going to find 

510.47 510.78 B: yea 

511.63 514.92 A: is it only what saddam wants them to find or is it huh 

515.50 517.72 A: you know can they actually do a good job 

519.11 520.90 A: yea finding arms that are there 

521.12 522.00 B: huh i'll tell you that 

522.38 523.11 B: hum 

523.24 524.85 B: from my point of view it's 

525.56 528.47 B: all we can do is be very sceptical about it because 

528.38 528.72 A: right 

528.98 532.12 B: that's all we get is what the news tells us 

532.37 537.38 B: and that is sometimes in this kind of situation hard to believe any ways 

537.34 540.98 A: it is it is hard to believe you don't know how much is spin and how much is 

541.93 542.65 B: yup 

542.60 544.08 A: you know what some official is 

549.41 549.92 B: defiantly 

550.31 552.73 A: yea i would prefer us not to get into a war 

554.57 556.97 A: diplomatically avoid a war 

557.43 558.49 A: that would be my vote 

559.41 560.36 A: i don't huh 

561.09 562.26 A: i don't want to see anybody 

562.58 564.19 A: anybody for huh 

565.38 567.01 A: for the cause of 

567.53 568.70 A: disarming iraq 

569.01 570.27 B: yes me too 

570.86 571.78 B: i'm just afraid that 

571.95 572.31 B: huh 

573.41 580.45 B: saddam and the way that he runs his country and the way that he has people in his military that they are so hard nosed and 

581.18 582.00 B: and every thing that 

582.33 582.81 B: there 

583.08 584.54 B: not probably not 

584.80 586.28 B: willing to give up at all 

586.90 588.03 A: yea and i'll have a good 

588.25 589.06 B: and that's huh 

590.43 591.93 B: that'll be the hard part you know 

592.10 597.16 A: yea so you have to come to position a diplomatic position like the middle east right 

597.81 603.00 A: to try to go and help the middle east you try get them to back down from their hard nose positions 

603.85 607.32 A: fine and easy find some way to back down with out losing face 

608.59 614.32 A: and i think it's going to be hard with saddam hussein because saddam doesn't care who likes him and who doesn't 

614.46 614.76 B: yea 

616.56 618.65 B: i know that one one reason why 

620.02 626.53 B: well i i guess just americans in general think that you know we need to stay friends with the middle east and iraq and 

627.15 628.99 B: especially we can because we get oil from them 

629.28 629.73 A: right 

629.82 630.55 B: but huh 

630.90 631.34 B: i heard that 

631.48 631.92 B: are 

632.99 633.44 B: poor 

633.81 637.17 B: it was on c._n._n. and this woman was saying 

637.62 642.34 B: we don't get as much oil as people think only about i out of eight barrels comes from the middle east 

642.68 644.50 A: that's interesting where does the rest come from 

644.65 649.18 B: huh venezuela a lot and other south american countries 

649.07 649.40 A: mm 

649.52 651.19 B: and huh canada 

651.82 653.02 B: and the were talking about 

653.34 654.18 B: there and 

654.47 659.68 B: arguing back and forth about huh drilling and taping into the alaskan frontier 

659.44 660.25 A: right 

660.15 660.94 B: so 

661.06 662.66 B: you know they obviously had 

663.98 665.09 B: facts about it so 

665.49 667.38 B: i think that's some thing that america's 

668.24 669.16 B: you know the 

669.39 672.05 B: society selling off that we need to stay 

672.16 672.50 B: you know 

672.98 676.91 B: to be friends with them just because oil and everything but i guess not too much comes from them 

677.69 680.97 A: that's interesting i did realize the i assumed most of are 

681.27 682.95 A: are oil came from the middle east 

684.35 686.52 B: that's what i thought for sure to 

689.39 689.93 A: yea 

690.27 692.85 A: yea it'll be interesting to see what happens i huh 

693.66 695.35 A: or how much taco 

695.78 697.42 A: correlate with the 

698.26 700.62 A: the presidential election you know 

700.66 701.19 B: oh yea 

701.34 705.59 A: you know will war be more of a threat as election comes 

705.94 707.98 A: grocer you know or will it me huh 

708.94 710.62 A: we'll be just a good thing to 

710.73 714.18 A: to campaign on and then maybe there will be no award cause 

714.12 714.58 B: yea 

714.45 716.55 A: you know who ever gets elected will hopefully 

716.68 717.05 A: not 

717.42 718.08 A: not do it 

719.05 719.92 B: i know that
