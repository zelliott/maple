160.63 163.17 A: right right right 

164.26 174.59 A: well i'm i'm very happy with christmas and i don't think i would invent any other holiday i think the only people that invent holidays are hallmark i'm convinced 

173.47 177.13 B: uh [laughter] 

174.53 181.49 A: i'm convinced that hallmark invents holidays so that they can sell cards i think they invented secretaries' day 

178.01 179.32 B: (( yes )) 

181.03 182.90 B: yes uh 

181.98 184.90 A: and then they invented grandparents' day and 

184.39 191.00 B: i didn't know there was a grandparents' day i'm sorry i must be out of the loop on hallmark [laughter] 

186.91 187.65 A: (( oh yes )) 

189.77 192.33 A: well d- you don't have grandchildren 

192.16 199.67 B: i don't no i have children but uh but i never remember dealing with grandparents' day with 

194.84 197.28 A: okay you see so you don't know about 

198.70 200.94 A: oh no it's new [laughter] 

199.81 208.45 B: yeah and and with my uh and my my children don't seem to know about a grandparents' day dealing with their grandparents 

208.18 212.84 A: oh well [laughter] hallmark better get in touch with them 

210.08 211.86 B: they just haven't been 

211.97 216.95 B: they haven't been sucked in yet all right well 

213.77 215.99 A: no uh-uh no 

216.10 226.07 A: i think there are i i really think there are enough holidays without people inventing ho- i mean to me a holiday is too important to to mark an important event 

222.72 223.72 B: yeah 

224.63 233.88 B: well not only that but we have we have things on the calendar that that nobody knows about and yet they're major i mean things th- th- th- 

228.49 230.40 A: e- exactly 

234.38 236.59 B: the memorial day and 

234.91 240.21 A: especially if you if you buy your calendar from hallmark they're all [laughter] they're on the 

238.76 250.25 B: oh of course of course they'd like you to send cards for them all that should be the central ritual [laughter] who cares what the celebration is about the important thing is that they send a card 

241.89 243.33 A: [laughter] that's right 

243.34 246.19 A: that's right that's right [laughter] 

248.20 249.73 A: send a card 

249.75 256.05 A: [laughter] yeah i we get we get cards from some people on like easter and 

250.34 251.51 B: oh [sigh] 

256.33 258.22 A: no thanksgiving cards 

257.57 262.84 B: no that's that's interesting no one has succeeded in really commercializing thanksgiving [sigh] 

263.10 266.66 A: it's too close to christmas that's one thing i like about thanks- 

264.50 270.21 B: well but they've succeeded in com- commercializing uh uh uh uh 

270.38 271.35 B: halloween 

270.98 272.40 A: halloween yes 

271.95 273.59 B: and thanksgiv- 

272.58 277.19 A: well halloween halloween was wide open for commercialization 

275.35 276.49 B: yeah 

276.64 278.36 B: but thanksgiving has 

278.40 282.56 B: has the potential but no one has really succeeded it's it's 

281.77 282.70 A: well 

282.74 287.10 A: it's just the it's just the winding up till christmas i just uh 

286.42 298.39 B: well yeah it's uh th- the the opening of the big sales to try to get people shopping but but the central the central ritual of thanksgiving in in most families is still pretty much 

289.96 292.16 A: right yeah i can 

292.22 292.87 A: i 

298.31 299.42 A: family 

298.79 301.26 B: outside of the commercial realm 

300.62 302.57 A: yeah yeah 

301.57 304.77 B: unless unless you're a turkey farmer [laughter] 

303.82 307.14 A: [laughter] yes yes 

306.56 307.64 B: (( oh )) 

307.17 310.19 A: well i can remember when i was a kid um 

310.85 312.20 A: that uh 

312.20 312.83 B: [mn] 

312.30 325.19 A: we were we were downtown one day uh i don't know it must have been early in december or or after thanksgiving and there was there was some kind of christmas de- decoration in a in a 

325.22 339.23 A: store window and my mom said oh look at that thanksgiving's hardly even over [laughter] and they've got christmas things and i think about that one now and i think man when school opens they start hauling out the christmas decorations

333.69 335.53 B: (( ah right )) 

337.57 345.48 B: yes and i also noticed that that we were getting catalogues sent to us this summer with uh with halloween costumes in them 

342.16 344.31 A: oh yeah oh 

345.34 346.68 A: oh really oh 

345.85 354.51 B: yeah you get mail order catalogues from people like lillian vernon telling you about halloween in mid summer 

351.70 352.67 A: uh-huh 

353.96 355.71 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

355.81 367.87 A: yeah i know i used to sell avon and we they always did the promotion for us avon ladies in july for the christmas stuff you know 'cause we were supposed to be aware of it 

367.40 370.77 B: oh but that's different because there you're dealing with 

371.19 375.67 B: the the when when you're when you're doing a retail sale 

375.97 384.05 B: the the the wholesale season is months ahead of the retail of the of the corresponding retail season 

377.01 378.06 A: yes 

381.45 384.56 A: that's right yeah yeah 

384.49 388.97 B: and so you were faced with that but uh 

386.95 392.20 A: right yeah but avon ladies aren't big wholesalers i guarantee you 

390.57 400.81 B: well no no but but but no avon ladies are retailers and their wholesale distributors have to get to them with the appropriate lead time 

393.41 394.49 A: yeah 

394.69 398.06 A: right but they buy from the wholesalers yes 

400.14 402.04 A: right right 

400.75 405.74 B: so that you can plan what you're going to do for the season for the for the retail season 

405.49 406.61 A: yeah 

406.08 416.10 B: you wanna know what you should order and what you should have on hand and and how many uh and and and what special theme parties to hold and [laughter] 

415.47 421.85 A: yes and i d- i did some of that when i was an avon lady but i'm glad to be out of that now 

418.46 419.79 B: yeah 

420.93 423.99 B: well i got interesting email from my son 

423.81 424.95 A: mhm 

424.35 433.08 B: he was celebrating halloween this year as a as a as a member of the marching band on his campus 

432.80 435.26 A: oh i love marching bands 

433.31 434.51 B: and 

435.02 438.37 B: what they did is they went halloween caroling 

438.33 439.93 A: [laughter] 

439.33 452.48 B: and his definition of halloween caroling is that you take the band into a place where people don't expect or you take a a a band group basically into a place where people don't expect 

448.84 449.75 A: uh-huh 

453.47 458.95 B: a band to be located and play spooky music [laughter] so

461.80 465.24 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

463.96 468.52 B: [mn] under a footbridge that people walk over at midnight in the park 

467.53 470.44 A: and then you're very quiet until you hear somebody coming 

468.70 469.64 B: or 

470.11 478.35 B: or sneaking up into a up into the clock tower which is on his campus as important as the dome of the old capital was on ours 

477.93 479.10 A: uh-huh 

478.62 487.04 B: and sneaking up into the clock tower and playing what he described as a really bad arrangement of night on bald mountain 

486.96 487.92 A: (( oh )) 

487.19 489.94 B: [laughter] 

488.30 492.23 A: [laughter] i've never heard night on bald mountain is it a spooky song 

490.74 493.18 B: oh disney's fantasia 

493.19 496.13 A: oh okay okay 

494.68 495.92 B: yeah 

495.99 507.55 B: it's uh the the the the final major selection in disney's fantasia starts with night on bald mountain and ends up with something else i forget what the something else is called that's much more 

509.15 510.27 A: joyful 

509.68 511.15 B: joyful yes 

510.49 512.16 A: (( okay [laughter] yeah )) 

511.55 516.97 B: but night on bald mountain is the one with the demons coming out 

516.32 527.79 A: oh okay okay i don't think i've ever watched fantasia all the way through our church did something for um halloween this year that i thought was was really appropriate they um 

520.55 521.43 B: (( oh )) 

527.78 537.00 A: they um got several people to volunteer for something they called light the night and um families in in various neighborhoods around town 

537.00 547.81 A: moved their halloween celebration out into their front yard and had it all lit up you know with games going on and and stuff like that because 

547.74 562.45 A: i'll tell you what trick or treating was so much fun when i was a kid and th- uh we we have like three or four trick or treaters come by our house now because everybody's so scared that their kids are gonna get hurt you know that they take 'em to halloween parties 

550.77 551.67 B: yeah 

559.07 559.76 B: (( mm )) 

561.54 570.96 B: oh but that's very neighborhood dependent we seem to be in a neighborhood that people actually travel to from other neighborhoods to trick or treat 

569.31 572.84 A: [laughter] you guys must give good candy 

572.34 578.86 B: no it's it's just it's the neighborhood is attractive to trick or treaters it's a it's a fairly large 

576.44 577.58 A: oh 

577.68 580.35 A: it's the candy that attracts them 

579.94 585.74 B: no but it's a fairly large cul de sac and so people have this feeling of security 

582.29 583.46 A: okay 

585.17 587.88 A: okay not a lot of traffic and 

586.84 592.61 B: yeah and and yet there are several hundred houses in the neighborhood 

592.53 593.84 A: (( oh )) 

592.82 604.18 B: so you you see people parking the car and and staying in the car while their kids get out to trick or treat and come back to them it's the only entrance to the neighborhood so they feel 

600.65 601.54 A: (( oh )) 

604.05 605.24 A: okay 

604.62 606.68 B: their kids won't get lost 

606.52 607.52 A: yeah 

606.88 608.70 B: uh or or 

608.95 612.16 B: so we get hordes [laughter] 

611.57 613.71 A: oh wow no i i 

613.17 614.20 B: it's fun 

614.01 621.19 A: i was uh i was gone this year i went to a linguistics uh seminar in new mexico 

621.20 630.53 A: and left halloween day so i wasn't here but my husband said yeah about you know maybe half a dozen at the most and we bought we bought 

623.22 623.92 B: (( mm )) 

630.81 639.28 A: [laughter] pr- this is probably the reason we don't get we buy those little boxes of raisins to to give the trick or treaters maybe that's why nobody 

633.30 634.37 B: [laughter] 

635.53 636.42 B: (( oh )) 

638.15 643.05 B: that would've got my attention i was a i have always been a raisin person but 

642.22 643.24 A: (( [laughter] well )) 

643.58 647.50 A: (( you know if you have candy left over you have to eat it all )) 

643.82 644.46 B: (( th- )) 

647.06 648.33 B: that's true 

647.84 653.54 A: so if if you only have raisins left over you eat the raisins and you don't have to eat up candy 

653.03 657.07 B: right which is good for you uh 

656.05 657.91 A: yes right 

658.11 663.25 B: no i i i think part of it is the modern exurbia the exurbs 

663.28 665.11 B: have 

665.89 667.38 A: what are exurbs 

666.16 670.31 B: [mn] ex- the exurbs the areas outside the city limits the 

669.37 671.91 A: oh beyond suburbs even 

671.33 673.35 B: beyond suburbs right 

673.06 674.26 A: oh 

673.41 678.29 B: places like uh the the the the noles up on the river 

678.24 679.09 A: uh-huh 

678.39 685.65 B: or or the places where there's a one acre lot size houses are too spread out to trick or treat properly 

682.74 683.64 A: (( oh )) 

684.71 686.03 A: that's true 

686.06 686.97 B: (( and )) 

686.27 690.07 A: (( but our neighborhood isn't our neighborhood is you know [noise] friendly )) 

687.93 702.02 B: y- yeah there are neighborhoods which are better but then you have art- you don't want your kids going on arterial roads or the so you keep 'em a block away from the arterials and and it cuts out so much of the city 

695.56 697.45 A: right y- uh right 

698.73 699.84 A: mhm 

701.44 703.16 A: mhm yeah 

703.35 710.67 A: yeah but i don't know what to do and so you know what my mom keeps my mom lives lives with us but she keeps saying there's no kids in this neighborhood 

710.69 719.95 A: you see yeah you just don't see many kids in this neighborhood and that's kinda true you don't see many but you know you don't see much in the way of kids anyway because they all 

715.85 716.70 B: (( well ))
