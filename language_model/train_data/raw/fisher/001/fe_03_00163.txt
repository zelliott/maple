2.54 5.17 A: uh hi my name is bill [laughter] 

4.56 8.14 B: hi bill so do you have a favorite holiday [laughter] 

7.96 9.35 A: um 

10.23 12.91 A: i don't know i mean i guess uh i 

13.86 16.15 A: think thanksgiving might be my favorite holiday 

16.01 17.28 B: and why is that 

16.23 17.10 A: how 'bout 

17.34 19.80 A: well um 

20.45 24.23 A: i think because of all of the food and 

23.40 25.59 B: (( [laughter] )) 

24.47 27.83 A: and also thanksgiving is like a very um 

27.90 31.75 A: kind of low key and relaxing holiday for me 

29.37 30.35 B: mhm 

30.92 31.95 B: mhm 

31.92 36.54 A: whereas christmas is a little bit more hectic because you kinda you have to give presents and stuff 

32.36 33.26 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

34.58 35.66 B: mhm 

36.36 37.26 B: right 

37.30 40.10 A: and so thanksgiving i just sort of it's like 

37.31 38.13 B: right 

40.49 51.80 A: it's it's nice 'cause it's cold out and you get to hang out go to my parents and they you know my mom cooks all this food and i get to like lie around all day and it's 

42.78 45.12 B: (( mhm very cozy )) 

48.57 50.12 B: mhm 

50.85 55.96 B: mhm mhm mhm i wonder if thanksgiving is your mom's favorite holiday 

52.78 54.04 A: nothing 

56.29 63.84 A: yeah [laughter] i don't know about that yeah [laughter] yeah but for me nothing is required of me so 

56.60 60.55 B: [laughter] not so relaxing for her [laughter] 

62.95 64.27 B: yeah 

63.85 65.30 A: what's your favorite holiday 

64.91 74.07 B: um well i don't know i really like thanksgiving too for a lot of reasons you're talking about i think christmas has become 

74.15 76.55 B: so overwhelming and 

76.52 77.48 A: yeah 

76.68 79.52 B: you know there's there's more stress involved than 

79.89 92.52 B: than really visiting sometimes and relaxing and and enjoying what you know the meaning of the holiday is supposed to be and the other thing that i think is nice about thanksgiving especially these days is 

87.54 88.48 A: right 

92.80 98.40 B: is that it's a very inclusive holiday you know like ev- everybody is 

96.02 97.31 A: mhm 

98.19 112.21 B: i think in the united states feels comfortable being a part of those kinds of celebrations whereas [sigh] you know the religious holidays in a way can be kind of divisive in in in some respects you know 

103.40 104.20 A: yeah 

111.70 113.12 A: yeah i can see that [noise] 

113.32 116.95 B: but i do love christmas too i love the anticipation 

116.92 129.51 B: of it the feeling of you know walking around shopping and hearing bells and everybody gets excited thinking about what they're gonna get for people you know that part of it is is fun if you have the time 

128.60 141.31 A: oh yeah oh yeah yeah definitely i mean you know don't get me wrong i really i really love christmas and you know there's all kinds of unique stuff about christmas but i guess it's not it's not quite as relaxing as thanksgiving so 

136.68 139.07 B: [laughter] 

140.84 142.53 B: right i agree 

142.35 143.29 A: yeah 

142.70 145.86 B: are you are you ready for christmas this year 

145.82 150.79 A: no no not really i haven't actually done any shopping yet but uh 

147.62 148.48 B: yeah 

149.82 150.86 B: yeah 

150.98 152.67 A: so but [laughter] how 'bout you 

152.48 159.03 B: well um yeah i'm not ready at all [laughter] i got one gift which is tickets to a show 

159.48 160.66 A: oh that's nice yeah yeah 

160.12 166.77 B: for my brother and some other friends so that should be fun but other than that i'm not doing anything because i'm 

167.02 170.68 B: [mn] i'm in school you know i'm still finishing up the semester 

170.76 172.03 A: right right 

171.38 172.99 B: so what's your excuse 

173.43 176.40 A: i don't i it's [laughter] i don't know 

176.30 177.65 B: [laughter] 

176.47 185.81 A: i haven't gotten on to it thanksgiving and everything and i don't know i've got uh i'm also i've also got school all the time and i'm 

179.48 180.43 B: yeah 

183.52 186.44 B: mhm are you a last minute shopper 

186.84 191.56 A: yeah i usually don't uh do my christmas shopping until pretty late anyway 

190.77 193.15 B: christmas eve [laughter] 

192.43 196.28 A: well sometimes yeah sometimes last year i actually 

196.43 206.89 A: last year i had all my christmas shopping done before i went home to visit my family um but that was probably the only 

202.49 203.49 B: mhm 

206.96 211.22 A: the only year i've ever actually been prepared for christmas was last year 

208.49 209.78 B: mhm 

210.42 212.44 B: mhm mhm mhm 

211.48 215.11 A: and i think this year's not gonna be like that [laughter] so 

214.21 215.28 B: uh-huh 

216.05 221.83 B: i used to be someone who would get it all done like a month ahead of time and it seems like every year now 

221.82 235.35 B: i get closer and closer to getting my presents you know close to christmas 'cause [sigh] don't have time and i don't care that much about the whole presents side of it any more you know in a way i wish you could just 

226.61 227.98 A: (( mm mhm )) 

233.53 234.90 A: mhm 

235.32 238.31 B: get rid of that part of christmas and just 

236.97 237.90 A: yeah 

238.55 243.40 B: get together and have fun and you know play games and talk and 

244.12 249.19 B: [sigh] i don't know i think the presents have have become too big a deal in a way 

249.53 252.96 A: yeah there's sort of like too many uh expectations it seems like 

252.37 254.76 B: mhm mhm mhm 

253.61 254.55 A: um 

254.56 260.99 A: i mean i think the gift giving is really nice but it it can sorta get like out of hand especially when 

259.39 260.59 B: mhm 

261.08 264.38 A: you know you're expected to give a gift to everybody or or 

263.99 265.08 B: right 

264.90 267.28 A: it's because of the expectations i think [laughter] 

266.47 271.23 B: i know and you and then you end up i end up anyway going through all these 

271.18 282.69 B: fights with myself about who you know who i should get gifts for and i cannot afford all this stuff i mean i just can't as a student but i'm old enough that i feel like 

278.06 279.26 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

282.80 290.70 B: i should be getting gifts you know for all the kids in the family and all this stuff and i just you know it's making me broke [laughter] it's 

289.97 291.46 A: yeah yeah 

292.93 295.13 B: hard have to come up with 

293.17 296.51 A: [mn] yeah but it's sort of like oh go ahead 

296.55 303.10 B: i was just gonna say i have to come up with creative ways of you know making gifts for people or something like that 

303.10 304.21 A: right 

303.80 305.67 B: but i haven't done that yet 

304.25 305.07 A: yeah 

305.71 310.88 A: yeah that's more obviously more time consuming though so it's like dilemma for somebody you know 

308.20 309.36 B: yeah 

309.97 311.02 B: (( i know )) 

311.23 313.00 A: who doesn't have a lot of time on their hands 

312.51 314.84 B: i know what were you gonna say 

314.85 325.23 A: oh i was gonna say that uh what was i gonna say oh well i mean like i like just on the uh really into the fact that i like the idea of giving presents you know 

324.62 326.26 B: mhm mhm 

325.60 326.66 A: um 

326.75 330.75 A: because i think you know it could be like a it should be like a really um 

331.70 338.43 A: [lipsmack] kind of joyful thing you know to give somebody gifts or receive gifts from people yeah when you when 

333.19 335.35 B: yeah and it is 

335.37 336.84 B: yeah it is 

338.77 342.73 A: so much is expected though then it's like you know when you're ex- 

342.55 348.76 A: when it's then it's like it's less of a gift and more of an obligation and then it sort of is not as uh 

346.10 347.22 B: right 

348.61 361.06 A: much of a happy thing but sort of just a regular thing just that it's instead of being extra happy when you get a gift it's like you're pleased to get a gift but you would be upset if you didn't get one you know and that kind of thing 

351.50 352.75 B: yeah 

359.71 366.01 B: mhm mhm mhm mhm and also the i mean what's really fun about giving gifts is when you have 

366.22 373.42 B: when you think about something that you think is really gonna make that person happy or you know something personal that 

373.72 376.32 B: is meaningful to the two of you but 

376.87 379.02 B: i i feel like with with 

379.12 393.43 B: so many gifts that i feel i should buy these days i don't even have time to think about that aspect of it it's just like get the list done it's a checklist to get through and but i i guess a lot of that is your your personal attitude you just have to 

388.27 389.78 A: (( so mm yeah )) 

394.00 403.69 B: [sigh] remember to to keep the the meaning in mind and not not get all caught up with just a checklist of obligations [laughter] 

402.96 409.11 A: yeah yeah yeah so if you could uh design your own holiday what [laughter] what would you 

407.70 408.96 B: oh yeah 

409.58 411.18 A: (( what would you do if you could )) 

410.08 413.08 B: oh jeeze that's a tough question [laughter] 

412.39 415.04 A: yeah i don't know i don't know how to answer [laughter] that question either 

414.93 422.92 B: you know but i think what i what i would love is the kind of holiday where everybody in the whole world stops 

422.84 433.11 B: for like a week and i know this is impossible but we're just playing a game here right so [laughter] where everybody could just take time to be together and that's it 

427.73 428.94 A: (( mm yeah )) 

432.17 433.19 A: yeah 

433.06 441.78 B: you know and and do fun things together and nobody has all these pressures pulling them away or you know obligations of things to do and 

433.26 434.05 A: yeah 

442.11 446.97 B: everybody could just truly enjoy the moment for a little while with each other 

446.25 448.11 A: mhm 

447.14 448.52 B: you know how 'bout you 

448.79 459.57 A: yeah well i don't know i don't know that would be nice if there was just like not you know if you could have like a true holiday where you could just relax and not really have a lot of 

460.04 461.81 A: obligations but i guess 

462.48 464.09 A: like 

464.19 468.95 A: i don't know i i guess i'd still be worried that even in that case um 

469.26 473.09 A: you know like even if you didn't have to do anything for a whole week you know 

473.13 477.11 A: and everybody could just hang out together well then like 

477.36 486.86 A: i'd you know everybody would want me to hang out with them you know like my family and and my fiancee's family you know and my 

480.90 482.16 B: that's true 

482.17 483.30 B: that's true 

484.91 488.18 B: right right [laughter] right 

487.60 493.20 A: and we'd all have to figure out like when we could spend time together you know and my aunts and my uncles and my cousins 

490.63 491.62 B: (( uh-huh )) 

491.64 499.76 B: and no matter what you do somebody's gonna be mad at you [laughter] it's true there's no escaping the guilt [laughter] 

495.25 498.64 A: [laughter] yeah somebody's gonna feel 

499.54 503.80 A: yeah yeah somebody will feel left out if you don't if you don't hang out with them so [laughter] 

503.18 507.43 B: (( [laughter] well this is a pretty depressing conclusion that we're coming to )) 

508.52 510.57 B: [laughter] there is no ideal 

509.32 514.86 A: not that it wouldn't be not that it wouldn't be fun but i don't know if the pressure could come into this but 

512.09 513.68 B: (( [laughter] )) 

514.11 516.98 B: yeah yeah yeah 

517.31 519.35 A: yeah i don't know if i would really 

520.07 522.31 A: design a holiday 

523.10 526.35 A: i i think i'm pretty satisfied with the holidays that already exist 

525.93 527.03 B: mhm 

526.85 527.76 A: (( so i don- )) 

527.74 528.76 B: mhm 

527.97 531.21 A: i don't know i can't really think of how to create 

531.49 534.42 A: an like a new holiday or anything 

533.39 535.34 B: mhm mhm 

536.03 540.19 B: [sigh] yeah maybe the one thing that i think 

540.75 551.50 B: doesn't exist that would be nice is something like that everybody would really share you know instead of national holidays and religious holidays and just with how 

544.48 545.12 A: (( mhm )) 

551.75 552.73 B: um 

553.35 565.51 B: strained tensions are between people these days i don't know it's interesting to think about if there was a holiday where really everybody in the world could reflect on 

566.62 569.43 B: that on our common you know 

570.05 571.64 B: [sigh] status as 

571.78 575.57 B: inhabitants of this planet [laughter] you know 

576.18 579.13 A: mhm yeah yeah i guess every holiday 

579.95 581.43 A: is supposed to have some 

581.54 583.12 A: meaning to it so 

583.31 587.62 A: if there was a holiday that was meaning was just being a person [laughter] 

583.36 584.54 B: mhm well 

587.82 589.33 B: but i mean being 

588.47 589.41 A: (( would be nice )) 

589.53 593.74 B: being yeah our shared humanity i think that's meaningful 

591.20 592.21 A: yeah 

592.34 593.10 A: uh-huh 

593.65 594.74 A: yeah 

593.91 601.93 B: like to transcend i mean there are all these differences and i i i mean by no means do i think difference is bad always bad but 

602.82 608.09 B: [sigh] we should think some once in a while i think about what we all have in common too 

608.16 611.25 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

611.82 612.61 A: (( would be nice )) 

611.92 615.47 B: [sigh] so [laughter] how long does this thing go on 

613.79 615.22 A: (( very peaceful and very )) 

615.58 620.71 A: i don't know i i think well it seems like we've already been talking for ten minutes 

620.67 621.74 B: uh-huh 

621.69 625.27 A: i didn't know if it was gonna cut us off when our ten minutes was up or 

624.01 625.14 B: yeah 

625.48 627.31 B: i don't know well 

626.60 628.38 A: i kinda think that it might
