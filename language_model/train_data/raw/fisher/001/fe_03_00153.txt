58.67 59.53 A: yeah so 

60.15 61.03 A: i guess i would 

60.43 60.85 B: which 

61.61 63.63 B: which we love (( )) country 

63.79 64.64 A: yes 

65.58 67.59 A: oh so you've you've gone to canada seriously 

67.79 68.26 B: yes 

68.73 69.55 A: oh wow 

69.36 72.03 B: if (( )) if we if we actually go to war with iraq i'm going to canada 

72.55 73.95 A: so you have family there 

76.26 76.72 B: (( )) 

77.01 81.08 B: (( )) i'm sorry i will see you all later goodbye 

80.99 81.46 A: oh 

82.74 83.49 A: well 

84.13 88.90 A: i don't i don't i don't i think it's kind of like a bullying tactic for us to even be 

89.03 90.00 A: dealing with iraq 

91.22 91.97 A: i don't know 

92.69 94.19 A: i don't think it's necessary for that 

92.95 93.42 B: (( )) 

95.09 99.35 A: like i'm i'm not sure what the purpose is of um having uh weapons inspections 

100.06 104.41 B: (( )) the weapons inspections to make sure that they can't nuke great britain 

105.26 105.68 A: right 

106.06 106.70 B: and 

107.58 111.42 B: the rest of it is because we want to control the oil supply 

111.10 111.59 A: right 

113.14 113.60 B: like 

114.41 116.95 B: (( )) get over it build a damn electric car 

117.17 118.54 B: we have plenty of electricity 

119.90 121.65 A: i think they actually working on um 

122.03 122.92 A: electric cars 

123.18 124.68 A: bringing those into the main stream 

125.13 127.78 B: and it's like okay 

127.90 130.84 B: out here i have batteries that real run 

130.98 134.40 B: this telecommunications equipment for sixty four hours 

135.32 140.42 B: okay and this is a lot of power this is more than it would take to turn an electric motor 

140.55 143.34 B: they have electric trains for crying out loud 

144.83 146.06 A: so then the 

146.54 148.88 A: the whole idea behi- behind um 

150.02 152.08 A: keeping our hands in the petroleum thing 

153.19 155.38 A: wouldn't that be like about power and about 

155.14 156.20 B: yes it's run 

155.66 156.72 A: domination 

156.88 157.77 B: yeah 

157.70 158.56 A: yeah so 

158.90 162.16 B: it's it's not about iraq it's about the it's about the damn oil 

162.26 162.91 A: yeah 

163.87 167.56 B: but from what i from what i've seen on t._v. these guys these (( )) 

168.05 169.72 B: think whoa (( )) 

171.00 171.68 A: yeah 

171.99 172.50 B: it's like oh 

172.63 174.87 B: seems (( )) run down and 

176.38 177.72 B: you know stuff like that i'm like 

180.14 184.26 B: you know let the let the poor third world people alone 

185.25 188.00 A: basically i would have to agree with you on that one 

185.57 185.90 B: yea- 

187.74 190.85 B: you know it's it's like swatting flies with a damn tank 

195.18 199.16 B: and i ain't i ain't going to no i ain't going to no gulf war two 

199.56 200.18 A: yeah 

200.93 202.33 A: i definitely don't support it 

203.44 206.72 A: and i i i think the majority of the people don't support it but i don't think it's 

207.59 208.36 A: people realize 

208.28 211.42 B: the the majority of the people didn't support bush 

211.62 212.55 A: exactly 

213.49 214.28 A: exactly 

213.62 215.03 B: i voted for gore 

215.98 217.61 A: yeah i did too but 

218.61 219.75 A: he's still in office 

221.85 222.43 A: and i think 

223.15 224.73 A: i think a lot of it is um 

225.11 226.05 A: oh what do you think about it 

226.60 227.47 A: about bush just 

228.29 232.13 A: pretty much picking up the agenda where his father left off cause didn't wasn't his father the one 

232.71 234.12 A: in office during uh 

234.48 235.48 B: gulf war yep 

235.22 235.77 A: yeah 

236.91 240.46 A: so i think a lot of that is just picking up the agenda where where his father left off 

240.30 243.32 B: yep and 

245.19 245.72 B: he knows 

245.23 246.85 A: and it's basically unnecessary 

247.66 250.28 A: cause i don't don't doesn't everybody have um 

247.92 248.67 B: but the 

250.72 251.56 A: nuclear weapons 

252.09 254.24 B: yeah pretty much and 

253.68 254.04 A: so 

254.93 257.76 B: what's what's more he's starting a damn recession 

258.69 259.17 A: yeah 

258.98 263.07 B: company i work for just had to lay off fifteen people because 

263.66 266.03 B: like we sell telecommunications and 

266.36 268.05 B: networking services 

268.37 269.57 B: to places like 

269.73 272.49 B: large corporation and universities and stuff 

274.37 278.20 B: we- we just lost a couple of contracts because the companies that 

278.40 280.93 B: we had been providing bandwidth to closed 

282.28 283.23 A: providing what to 

283.51 284.22 B: bandwidth 

284.16 284.75 A: oh okay 

286.46 287.36 B: like the 

287.83 291.79 B: it's the voice and voice of internet data combined is called bandwidth 

292.75 294.93 A: so what do you think it a it'll take for um 

296.30 297.42 A: for america to 

297.53 299.37 A: to get out of iraq completely 

300.26 301.74 A: what do you think it'll take for them to 

302.54 302.97 A: not 

303.12 303.92 A: be so 

304.19 305.22 A: reliant on 

305.42 306.20 A: petroleum 

308.96 310.71 B: uh it's not going to happen 

310.85 311.31 A: not 

312.23 315.33 B: not going to happen it's too ingrained into american society 

319.12 320.00 B: you know people 

320.71 324.18 B: for ninety years have been driving gasoline powered cars 

326.87 327.71 A: ninety years 

328.43 329.04 B: ninety 

330.00 330.48 B: and 

330.72 334.15 B: basically people are going to resist the change to something new 

334.87 338.82 B: oh this electric this is electric shit give me a gasoline car 

343.35 345.75 A: and so then how would that work i if if um 

347.40 348.95 A: if hypothetically we did 

350.08 352.12 A: were able to switch to an electronic 

353.02 354.43 A: or an electric system 

357.05 357.34 A: i 

357.54 357.95 A: so wha- 

357.76 363.93 B: it'd be it'd be kind of like the g._m. hybrid car they got out uh what it would be is it would have a small 

364.27 366.19 B: compressed natural gas generator 

366.35 366.79 A: mhm 

368.75 369.23 B: that 

370.58 372.43 B: um charges the batteries 

373.06 374.78 B: and you drive off the batteries 

377.20 379.53 A: so then gas stations will basically become 

380.00 380.92 A: unnecessary 

381.54 386.56 B: oh you would still have you would still have to put natural gas in at some point to drive the generator 

386.61 387.03 A: right 

388.65 391.29 B: this is something the engineering guys and i have been rolling around 

391.83 394.56 B: but everybody has natural gas service to their home 

396.15 396.81 A: oh okay 

399.11 399.86 B: you know it's be- 

401.87 404.28 B: or it would be something that would be sold 

405.09 408.29 B: actually 

408.57 409.26 B: there are 

409.86 411.80 B: fairly efficient propane engines 

413.45 413.78 A: mmm 

413.98 414.82 B: where 

415.24 418.70 B: while we're transitioning away from it we could just use gas 

421.62 423.52 A: so do you know it like of any dialogue 

424.79 429.36 A: being thrown around about actually actually letting go of petroleum at all or is that just 

429.94 432.86 B: it's it's right now it's just an idea 

433.13 434.46 B: but everybody's got 

435.13 442.68 B: how it'll be so wonderful when we have cars that don't take gasoline but you've got electric trains you've got propane forklift 

442.94 445.03 B: forklifts you've got 

445.69 448.42 B: a friend of mine has a range and it runs on natural gas 

448.56 450.08 B: a ford ranger 

451.75 452.18 A: and how 

452.77 455.40 A: how often i mean like how ma- like how much 

456.26 456.93 A: of the 

456.40 456.82 B: it's 

457.11 457.93 A: train 

458.61 460.81 A: whatever is actually electric train 

461.04 462.33 A: cause like i've never heard of that 

462.78 466.49 B: the okay you've seen those big diesel trains going along 

463.12 463.61 A: what is it 

463.72 464.37 A: is it like 

466.96 467.37 A: mhm 

467.44 470.75 B: the that's a diesel generator powering an electric motor 

473.06 474.55 A: so most trains are electric 

474.83 475.29 B: yes 

477.59 479.57 A: okay well see i i never knew that 

480.73 481.61 A: i might have to 

482.21 483.90 B: yeah the trains 

484.02 486.86 B: trains for about fifteen years have been electric 

488.50 490.63 A: all trains have been electric for fifteen years 

490.94 492.22 A: and prior to that what were they 

492.65 494.06 B: the uh they were diesel 

494.50 495.21 A: oh okay 

497.55 498.05 B: but 

497.56 499.35 A: well then maybe maybe we are um 

500.36 501.47 A: moving towards that 

500.64 501.01 B: like 

501.44 507.05 B: (( )) pe- eh people people oh it's impossible to build an electric motor that big in life look at a damn train 

508.14 508.55 B: you know 

509.23 512.19 B: sure it takes a lot of juice and you have to have an on board generator but 

512.48 513.27 B: it's possible 

514.85 516.86 B: and think about it this way 

517.13 518.99 B: you get a car the size of a honda civic 

519.21 520.56 B: it's not as big as a train 

523.07 523.67 A: yeah 

525.15 526.06 A: but then so much 

526.91 529.50 A: of american culture is on consumption and 

529.94 530.28 B: yep 

531.08 531.76 A: bigness 

531.92 533.42 B: and greed 

533.67 534.28 A: right 

535.81 536.62 A: like i remember i wen- 

536.80 538.14 A: i recently went to um 

538.48 539.75 A: spent some time in england 

540.47 542.97 A: and i was just amazed at how small the bathrooms were like 

543.98 546.31 A: in homes not only in homes but the only like 

548.55 551.77 A: size bathrooms that were comparable to anything in america were like in 

552.15 553.29 A: big commercial 

553.57 555.06 A: public hotels and 

555.17 556.41 A: restaurants things like that 

556.79 557.25 B: yeah 

557.22 559.57 A: but like all the homes and the bathrooms were so small 

559.83 561.22 B: (( )) 

560.33 561.04 A: apartments 

561.25 562.73 A: living space period was 

564.61 566.67 B: i went over there i went over there i'm like 

567.36 569.86 B: holy shit how do you people put up with this 

570.31 571.00 B: what do you mean 

572.00 574.15 B: oh okay my apartment 

574.27 574.95 B: is 

575.12 576.66 B: seventeen hundred square feet 

577.61 578.42 B: wow 

579.20 580.53 B: how big is that in square meters 

580.98 582.23 B: i'd do the calculation
