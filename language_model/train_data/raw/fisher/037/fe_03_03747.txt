0.00 1.50 B: (( hi this is danni )) 

1.18 4.06 A: hi my name is ellen how are you this evening 

3.40 5.91 B: hi ellen i'm all right how are you 

4.92 7.07 A: fine good good 

6.32 7.90 B: okay so 

8.03 11.29 B: minimum wage increase to five fifteen right 

11.11 14.57 A: yes i didn't i hadn't heard about it but 

13.88 22.35 B: i didn't either [laughter] not until now but to me it seems just a little low just because of the area i'm in i'm on the west coast 

21.76 23.34 A: uh-huh me too 

23.10 24.81 B: oh okay yeah 

23.77 31.48 A: but i think i think no matter where you are who can live on five fifteen an hour especially with the cost of living these days 

28.72 29.75 B: uh-huh i know 

30.69 36.84 B: exactly five fifteen a you know i remember when it was four twenty five an hour 

32.16 32.80 A: (( [sigh] )) 

37.33 40.25 A: i remember when it was lower than that [laughter] 

38.86 42.88 B: (( lower [laughter] well yeah there was lower [laughter] than that but [laughter] )) 

43.08 45.97 B: but i don't that that's just when i started working 

45.68 46.88 A: (( uh-huh )) 

46.18 49.46 B: [laughter] so that's where i and i was so happy when 

49.96 57.72 B: it just you know i- i- when you first start out working and it's just when you first make like i think i worked like a hundred hours [laughter] 

58.35 59.77 B: (( and i was so happy )) 

59.75 61.01 A: mhm 

60.00 63.86 B: (( [noise] not my employer had to pay the overtime so they [laughter] weren't happy )) 

64.26 65.35 B: but um 

65.46 66.81 B: five fifteen 

66.89 68.70 B: i guess well that's recent 

68.76 70.04 B: that they get that 

68.96 69.99 A: yeah 

70.00 71.23 A: yeah 

70.59 73.43 B: but i just think that's so low 

73.21 80.13 A: [laughter] it wouldn't be as bad if they let you actually keep what you earn but they don't do that 

73.73 74.68 B: [laughter] 

78.54 81.42 B: i know what is it like a third that they take out 

80.55 82.60 A: yeah yes yes 

82.20 85.80 B: (( so [laughter] and actually out of it you're only making about )) 

86.23 87.11 B: like 

87.18 88.58 B: three something [laughter] 

88.36 89.23 A: (( uh-huh )) 

89.53 96.39 A: so i mean if the government wants to take their cut they should at least ensure that you get enough that you can afford to give it to them [laughter] 

95.49 101.91 B: i know i just wonder how they calculate that if they say you know cost of liv- cost of living and everything 

102.43 107.25 B: then they say okay what someone should be able to you know get by on this much 

107.48 109.95 B: i wonder if they can take out the taxes 

110.71 111.53 B: will 

111.78 119.93 A: i think their main concern is not raising it so much that people lay off that the employers lay off employees i think that 

118.62 122.30 B: they really lay off oh if it was so high 

120.48 121.54 A: that's what 

121.77 129.08 A: yeah that's what they claim we can't afford to pay these people anymore so we have to make one person do two jobs and blah blah blah 

128.77 130.16 B: oh 

129.82 130.90 A: yeah 

130.65 135.67 B: and see employees don't really have any control i mean i guess if you're unionized 

135.72 137.86 B: then then you do have 

138.00 140.11 B: some say but most jobs 

140.95 142.96 B: in california are at will 

143.02 144.47 B: employment 

143.38 145.90 A: mm mhm mhm 

144.74 147.83 B: so they don't really have too much of a say with that 

147.85 153.62 A: yeah i don't know whether it uh washington is an at will s- state or not i think it is actually 

153.19 154.65 B: oh really uh-huh 

154.05 167.73 A: but i even worked f- uh in one job where we did have a union and i was making ten dollars an hour and i thought that was low c- for the kinda work we had to do we were doing um medical research over the phone 

163.72 164.61 B: yeah 

167.64 168.99 B: (( oh my gosh mhm )) 

167.78 179.44 A: and that really yeah and that really took the took a lot of training to do interviews with people over the phone about all these health conditions and they they were really s- picky about how you asked questions and 

179.79 185.56 A: you know collecting all of the data and we we had a union and still we were only making ten bucks an hour 

181.72 182.58 B: uh-huh 

185.64 188.57 B: see i don't know because ten dollars an hour that's 

189.64 191.75 B: that's about how much they make at like 

192.40 195.11 B: like the amusement parks or maybe the starbucks 

195.97 200.75 B: and and if you're doing medical research over the phone and if it involves that much training 

200.79 202.12 A: mhm 

201.64 202.71 B: (( you know )) 

203.58 206.37 B: and then they take taxes out of it 

205.87 206.76 A: right 

207.63 215.72 A: so that's even twice what basically what the minimum wage is roughly what the minimum wage is now and it still that seems awful low to me 

207.78 208.68 B: [laughter] 

213.26 214.21 B: yeah 

215.13 220.15 B: (( yeah i i think that th- that was low for for that type of job )) 

220.19 223.80 A: well it's different if you k- you don't you know live with you know 

223.88 232.90 A: a huge number of family members and you can pool your resources to pay your you know your rent but if you want to live by yourself 

228.02 229.06 B: together 

232.97 235.95 A: there's no way that you're gonna make it on a minimum wage 

235.48 237.43 B: then no and that's anywhere 

237.44 238.38 A: yeah 

237.53 240.79 B: i mean i i would imagine even if you're in 

241.09 245.26 B: what's a low cost of living state maybe it's kansas or iowa 

245.04 246.43 A: mhm 

245.52 247.98 B: something in the even there 

248.33 250.70 B: (( i would think that you can't get by on )) 

250.88 252.64 B: five fifteen an hour 

252.95 256.41 B: tax is taken off if you have to get a place of your own 

256.84 262.58 A: plus what if you have kids to support or ol- elderly family members to support 

258.53 259.45 B: exac- 

262.07 263.21 B: mhm 

263.52 264.77 B: (( yeah but it would be )) 

263.82 267.16 A: i don't know how people do it i really don't 

266.83 268.90 B: do you think there are people who do 

268.96 271.25 B: get by on minimum wage or 

271.61 276.06 A: you know they must really have to work every angle they possibly can 

274.73 277.78 B: [noise] like multiple jobs 

277.48 278.46 A: uh-huh 

280.02 281.09 A: also 

280.06 280.99 B: and and then 

281.94 286.54 A: [lipsmack] some people go on welfare and they work under the table but [sigh] 

285.95 287.21 B: oh that's true 

286.92 290.39 A: that would that would be unreported income anyhow but i mean 

287.96 289.12 B: (( [laughter] [sigh] )) 

290.23 291.14 B: yeah 

290.43 296.93 A: you know they're they're doing all kinds of things going to the food bank going to the clothing bank 

296.27 297.26 B: uh-huh 

299.03 300.47 B: (( [noise] that is true )) 

300.48 302.45 B: but it does seem 

302.93 304.76 B: (( i don't know i'm just so )) 

304.78 311.23 B: i don't know i i know that i couldn't live off of that if i was just doing one job but it would take so much 

311.72 315.53 B: just to to survive on five fifteen an hour 

315.03 322.75 A: yeah you oh you would have to have multiple jobs and then if you have kids the kids now who's raising the kids nobody's raising the kids 

319.27 320.55 B: yeah 

321.35 326.11 B: yeah no one's gonna be raising them what if you have to go to school [noise] [mn] 

325.68 326.99 A: oh yeah 

326.83 330.45 B: you know because you don't wanna just be making minimum wage 

330.83 332.12 B: forever 

331.85 333.46 A: that's another thing too 

333.60 336.94 B: mhm so y- i mean you either have to get some kind of training 

337.42 338.81 B: to do something 

339.17 340.08 B: (( else )) 

340.98 342.24 B: or you just 

342.41 347.10 B: i guess work at that minimum wage job until you get 

347.13 351.39 B: promoted uh but it it's not that much of a jump 

351.45 352.26 A: no 

351.94 355.19 B: okay i know you can't go too mu- too far in 

355.77 356.46 A: like 

355.85 357.11 B: (( that type of job )) 

357.06 363.39 A: uh even a mcdonald's manager i mean i had a friend who was a mcdonald's manager he wouldn't support a family on that 

363.38 364.56 B: he he wouldn't 

363.40 367.75 A: and he was making more than the employees who were making minimum minimum wage 

367.46 371.66 B: he he could support a family on that or he couldn't oh yeah 

368.97 370.91 A: he couldn't he couldn't 

371.15 376.29 A: they were living in their car that's that's what happened to them [laughter] 

373.03 374.69 B: (( oh my god that's )) 

375.46 386.85 B: [laughter] that's so bad and he's a manager [laughter] you know 'cause you imagine not everyone's a manager there there's a lot of people that are just working there as regular employees 

378.86 380.02 A: (( yeah )) 

386.67 387.62 A: mhm 

386.97 389.11 B: and they have a family to support 

390.15 393.68 A: [lipsmack] but the thing is a lot of them are kids in in high school 

393.67 394.84 B: (( well that's true )) 

393.77 394.57 A: um 

394.70 398.80 A: they don't have the expenses that that a an adult would have 

398.28 402.54 B: yeah that's true too they're living at home so 

403.26 404.76 B: like the rent 

404.85 406.29 B: isn't there [laughter] 

406.17 407.51 A: (( right mhm )) 

406.65 409.21 B: the utilities you don't have to pay for [sigh] 

412.59 414.87 B: (( but yeah i just think that's really low )) 

414.75 416.26 A: yeah 

416.28 419.79 B: [sigh] [noise] the minimum wage that's usually 

420.40 422.86 B: i know the fast food restaurants 

423.40 424.49 B: (( they )) 

425.35 428.22 B: their minimum wage but what other 

429.17 433.35 B: i guess places are usually minimum wage 

433.26 438.12 A: even regular restaurants because they figure that the employees will get tips 

437.58 439.14 B: [noise] oh that's that's 

438.20 440.27 A: and make make up the difference 

439.93 441.96 B: right so like bartenders 

442.04 444.65 B: and [noise] food servers 

445.15 446.62 B: those are usually minimum wage 

445.23 448.35 A: i think bartenders might get more i'm not sure 

448.08 449.29 B: oh okay 

448.93 451.06 A: 'cause they're more in demand 

451.40 452.63 B: oh that's true 

453.71 455.32 A: car wash people 

455.17 456.83 B: [noise] oh yeah 

455.51 456.50 A: (( you know )) 

457.06 458.55 B: (( they're minimum wage )) 

459.58 461.54 A: probably a lot of store clerks 

461.69 462.92 B: like retail 

462.85 463.77 A: (( as if )) 

464.22 464.91 B: (( that's )) 

464.96 466.51 B: oh yeah i could see that 

466.29 470.06 A: although i would hope that they would get more but some stores i'm sure they don't 

469.89 476.18 B: oh yeah like i know maybe the smaller stores they would probably get minimum wage but maybe the chains 

472.38 473.28 A: mhm 

476.57 480.93 B: might be a little higher i just kn- well all i know of right now is macy's 

481.11 481.95 A: uh-huh 

481.32 488.23 B: um i know they're but i think the minimum wage in california is about six something i wanna say 

487.40 490.24 A: yeah i thought it was higher too 

490.37 491.30 B: yeah 

490.52 495.25 A: but i guess [mn] there's a difference between your state minimum wage and your federal minimum wage [sigh] 

494.74 497.86 B: uh-huh it was good that they have to go by um 

498.19 500.13 B: [lipsmack] whichever is higher [sigh] 

499.59 500.50 A: mhm 

500.57 508.01 B: [laughter] but um yeah i know macy's is about like i think they get paid eight something or and something just little bit higher 

505.35 506.27 A: yeah 

507.94 510.24 A: no wonder the service is so bad there 

510.05 514.90 B: i know [laughter] they're not happy to be there [laughter] 

510.65 511.62 A: [laughter] 

513.84 515.56 A: no they're not 

516.43 518.72 B: the only service i guess that you get 

519.06 522.48 B: is um that's good is is if they're on commission 

522.52 523.36 A: right 

523.19 529.74 B: which is [mn] and there's there's a thing with that because you'll get hounded when they're on commission 

529.51 530.48 A: uh-huh 

529.91 534.04 B: but it's a little bothersome but at the same time 

532.10 532.98 A: sure 

534.49 538.13 B: you know when they're not on commission they really don't pay attention to you 

538.16 539.22 A: that's true 

538.72 540.74 B: 'cause they'll get paid no matter what 

540.58 550.51 A: [laughter] they really have this attitude i mean i haven't been into macy's in a while but they have this attitude that they were doing me a favor just listening to my question [laughter] [sigh] 

541.25 541.85 B: (( [laughter] )) 

548.40 550.54 B: oh my gosh see that's 

551.01 552.09 B: [laughter] 

553.32 558.94 B: yeah i i've i've been in situations like that and i just think gosh you know you really just don't get it 

560.59 563.94 B: [mn] but i mean if they're only getting paid so much then 

564.04 566.17 B: i guess you really can't expect [laughter] 

566.11 574.05 A: but see that's the other thing too it's not just the employees that suffer it's the customers that suffer when employees aren't getting enough pay [laughter] 

571.01 572.53 B: yeah and then [mn] 

573.30 579.77 B: that's right and then overall it's like and you know it puts a bad taste in your mouth you don't wanna go back to the store 

579.50 580.47 A: right 

580.11 582.25 B: if if you can help it 

582.20 589.98 A: so the store doesn't do well so in a way just having a minimum wages is doing you know the employers a favor in certain respects 

589.65 595.11 B: yeah i don't know if they see it that way though [laughter] [laughter] 

592.58 595.52 A: no i'm sure they don't i'm sure they don't 

595.17 599.95 B: they probably stop their thinking stops right at how much they have to give out
