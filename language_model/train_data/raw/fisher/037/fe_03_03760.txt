55.08 56.32 B: oh really 

57.38 59.20 B: oh mm 

59.23 68.05 A: so uh yeah that minimum wage would not cover anybody i think it's something like sixty percent of people who earn minimum are supporting a family 

67.74 68.87 B: mhm 

68.57 70.66 A: some huge number actually it 

69.68 72.45 B: well i used to i used to work at a bookshop and um 

72.89 80.51 B: i mean i was making a little bit more than minimum wage but i mean some people who like you know drive buses make like fifteen or twenty 

81.14 87.31 A: oh yeah yeah a lot of people make minimum wage if you work in a hotel and your cleaning the rooms 

81.15 83.63 B: so it's like gosh [laughter] 

86.98 87.96 B: mhm 

87.34 90.81 A: busboys waiters are making less they're living on 

91.15 92.58 A: on the tips 

92.42 94.07 B: mhm 

93.19 103.19 A: i mean you would just yeah there actually there's a woman who wrote a book uh [noise] just last year about making minimum wage and trying to survive on it it's called nickel and dimes 

102.59 104.04 B: yeah i've heard of that 

103.41 112.08 A: yeah barbara evers and she uh it's worth reading she went around like to the east and picked these really bad jobs and tried to manage and 

104.69 106.70 B: mhm 

111.50 112.30 B: (( mm )) 

112.15 119.94 A: and uh met all the other people doing it too and they were living like if you couldn't live in a city you'd have to live farther away and get in somehow 'cause nothing 

120.13 122.79 A: where these things were was a- attainable 

122.52 123.51 B: mhm 

122.86 125.09 A: you couldn't pay like rent in a 

125.20 137.37 A: in los angeles and [laughter] and make minimum wage so you'd have to live outside and drive in and no one was managing and no one had health care and people had kids and there was no [mn] 

135.60 136.23 B: (( mm )) 

136.94 141.13 B: it is true because like i remember when i was looking for an apartment about five years ago 

141.04 153.56 B: i looked at this um little book and they had apartments in palmdale which is like really really my dad lives in valencia so i you know i know the area pretty good and they were like there was like three hundred and something for like a one bedroom 

145.17 147.51 A: oh my god yeah it's way far 

149.06 150.15 A: right 

153.63 159.91 A: yeah if you wanna live in palmdale right [laughter] the only thing is it's an hour away [laughter] at best 

153.70 155.54 B: and i mean they had like a pool 

158.69 160.05 B: yeah 

160.22 162.27 A: at the best with no traffic 

162.04 166.93 B: or like they um nuclear um they're making like nuclear bombs or something in 

167.15 173.84 B: new mexico [laughter] i mean apartments near there were really cheap i mean but it's like something really terrible 

174.00 181.29 A: [sigh] hey ay so you're for an increase i mean would you support that federally i think that's a bad thing that alleged inflation 

179.56 181.14 B: yeah i'd say so 

181.29 193.02 A: 'cause wh- when you know people the people who own the business always say it would drive them out of business they would lay off people it would be bad for individuals because they couldn't afford to pay like if you were the owner of a pizza hut [mn] 

185.49 186.06 B: (( [noise] )) 

193.06 197.20 A: and you had fifteen employees and then you had to raise the minimum wage 

197.22 202.98 A: they'd say oh we didn't we would end up cutting people's job to to do that so that would be bad for the economy 

203.31 206.37 B: yeah but five fifteen is so low i mean 

206.40 210.76 B: i think they should raise to like you know maybe five seventy five and 

206.44 208.00 A: they don't buy that argument 

208.55 209.52 A: well six 

209.69 211.48 A: it's six seventy five here 

211.16 212.46 B: or huh 

212.27 214.31 A: california it's six seventy five 

213.78 215.75 B: yeah i was gonna say i mean 

215.81 220.27 B: i thought it was i didn't think it was that low here it's six seventy five 

218.34 219.66 A: yeah well it's 

219.67 231.05 A: yeah it's state by state i mean there's a federal standard but each state has its own so there's a lot to so of course california business owner say well that drives business out of california 'cause people don't wanna pay that 

221.09 222.83 B: oh yeah 

223.73 224.38 B: (( mm )) 

231.10 234.11 B: mm what did you do when you worked for the government

242.82 244.62 A: (( yeah but never mind )) 

243.67 244.67 B: (( but um )) 

245.05 246.30 A: not any longer 

246.65 251.81 B: well i still do i mean not as like a job or anything i used to kind of do it as a job 

251.82 260.90 B: but i still write letters and stuff mostly for like animal rights and i joined the green party so i guess i am in favor of you know a living wage and everything 

254.94 255.69 A: (( uh-huh )) 

260.22 262.45 A: (( [laughter] what the heck )) 

261.01 263.02 B: but my main attitude is 

263.25 265.57 B: i would rather work for myself 

265.78 274.77 B: because you can make and also i like referring people like for this study i've referred a bunch of male friends and i'm already making money because they 

271.48 272.44 A: yeah 

273.81 276.25 A: oh for this deal right right so 

275.00 277.30 B: they really love doing this and um 

277.44 281.72 B: it's like there's unlimited opportunities in sales and marketing so 

281.99 285.72 A: you're lucky [laughter] 

285.08 287.29 B: well i'm not making that much money but 

287.13 290.78 A: more than five fifteen an ho- have you ever worked for a minimum wage before and 

290.24 293.95 B: well like i said i work at that i worked at crown books uh 

292.94 294.95 A: they were paying you a minimum wage at crown 

294.38 304.56 B: well i think i was making a little bit more but i mean after a year and a half they gave me like a like a twenty five cent or something raise and i was like wow you know big deal 

303.65 305.30 A: how many years ago was that 

305.25 308.35 B: that was about like two years ago or 

308.45 309.12 B: oh 

309.42 312.41 B: about two years ago yeah 'cause they went out of business 

309.48 310.71 A: oh recently 

312.08 316.97 A: i think they were bought out wow jeeze i had no idea they only paid minimum wage 

316.82 321.16 B: well they paid more than minimum wage but not much more 

317.52 318.72 A: basically 

321.01 323.40 A: that's probably why people aren't staying though 

323.41 327.56 A: i mean who would you know you do it as a if you were a high school student or something 

328.13 335.42 B: there were a lot of uh college students there and older like kinda like this one guy was retired or whatever 

329.09 331.27 A: i bet there were i'm sure 

335.25 341.38 A: well when i go into borders i see mostly people in their thirties and forties working there i'm sure they can't be making that much money 

340.43 343.15 B: it's mostly uh college students 

342.97 350.64 A: uh not in the um the borders over uh on i always see like adults you know not students working there 

349.11 349.87 B: (( mm )) 

350.60 354.45 B: well it's i mean there's a lot of competition to get a job in a bookstore 

354.55 357.04 B: i mean i had to go back for like two interviews i 

356.57 357.90 A: (( really )) 

357.19 362.08 B: mean people l- i mean people love working in bookstores it's it's a pretty fun job to have 

361.94 363.86 A: do you have to be on your feet all day though 

363.37 373.00 B: yeah that's the thing i didn't like about it but i was so strong i mean i really worked a lot and i i mean i had to run back and forth back and forth because they only had like two phones 

373.31 377.90 A: oh when you're on the floor you're on your yeah you're on your feet the whole time you never sit probably 

373.77 375.52 B: it was exhausting though 

376.62 381.05 B: i mean crown books is cheap i mean they're like really cheap compared to like borders or 

381.33 384.85 B: but um there's a lot of competition to get a job in a bookstore 

384.59 389.62 A: for basically minimum wage that's amazing well of now i'm sure because the economy's so bad 

389.53 392.10 B: well that's what someone said to me they go um 

392.11 405.23 B: they go well people who work at bookstores you know they just have a love of books they're not there for the money i mean [laughter] it kinda took me a while i thought to myself oh i get it [laughter] because i found that you know people who like you know 

397.99 399.13 A: well 

399.48 400.43 A: sort of 

401.28 403.19 A: [laughter]

409.52 410.92 A: (( okay yeah )) 

413.73 421.22 A: well i love books too but i wouldn't work for that little unless i mean unless that was really all there was i i think you can make more at mcdonalds

430.57 431.44 B: mhm 

435.57 437.00 B: mhm

441.12 444.16 A: out of high school i had a summer job 

442.38 445.46 B: (( that's that's when i got out of i graduated in eighty )) 

445.53 450.22 A: i made five bucks an hour and i thought i was doing pretty well 'cause minimum wage was three and a quarter 

449.96 451.45 B: mhm 

450.98 454.65 A: (( so it's like oh this is great five bucks an hour [laughter] ))

488.88 489.88 A: yeah that 

490.03 491.34 A: that pays better 

492.20 495.00 A: right well that's gonna pay better than minimum certainly

510.03 524.48 B: no way i mean it was just it wasn't so much the books i mean it was just the way they treat you they believe me it looks like a really nice job but sometime- it's really a lot of pressure that the boss is so mean to you you know i mean they they want you 

514.39 515.83 A: no yeah 

523.51 525.11 A: the management was mean

572.44 580.49 A: oh wow [laughter] well i know this was a couple of years ago so the economy wasn't as bad as it is now it's probably harder to get it now
