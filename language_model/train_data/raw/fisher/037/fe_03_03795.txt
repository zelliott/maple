4.63 5.58 B: (( how are you )) 

5.32 6.33 A: good how are you 

6.07 7.26 B: good 

7.54 9.73 A: is this the first time you've ever done anything this 

9.31 12.52 B: (( no this is the i did this is my third call )) 

12.07 14.24 A: okay i haven't done this yet 

13.61 15.84 B: oh yeah it's not that bad 

15.20 16.17 A: (( okay )) 

15.91 23.77 B: [laughter] but i i kinda missed the question it's draw the line between acceptable comedy and comedy or humor and humor that does what 

16.47 17.35 A: [laughter] 

24.06 32.24 A: [mn] just unacceptable humor i guess um you know kind racy stuff [laughter] i guess like when you insult others or you know 

28.85 30.65 B: oh 

32.47 42.49 A: i guess it would alienate others if you um you know you have probably sexual humor's probably more unacceptable you know in big situations i mean you know i'm not sure with your friends or something 

40.88 41.77 B: yeah 

42.25 46.08 B: yeah [lipsmack] but it really depends on who you are or who you're with i 

45.89 46.80 A: pardon me 

46.18 50.29 B: me- i guess it depends on who you are speaking to [laughter] who the 

49.94 51.74 A: i know i don't if the 

51.75 57.59 A: i guess like just in your pub- in public what would be more acceptable conversation [laughter] 

56.99 59.12 B: oh right right right 

58.93 59.91 A: um 

60.61 62.89 A: i'm not positive [laughter] 

63.05 72.49 A: i guess probably just like day to day um things are probably more acceptable than like sex and um religion and things like that that would be a little bit more controversial 

72.28 80.14 B: right right i guess there are people who are are kind of sensitive to those things but i guess i was at a luncheon the other day and there were a lot of um 

80.26 85.47 B: th- there were like a lot of jewish people in the crowd and and brad buttons do you know what that is 

85.16 86.03 A: no 

85.81 95.95 B: me neither but he's like a famous old guy i think [laughter] and you know he made like you know some jewish jokes and they were everybody thought they were so funny but i'm not jewish so i didn't i didn't really get them so 

88.77 89.75 A: okay 

95.26 97.31 A: [laughter] that's funny 

96.62 99.96 B: (( [laughter] but they everybody else thought it was really funny )) 

97.62 98.58 A: yeah i guess 

99.71 100.70 A: yeah 

100.75 114.15 A: i think i think religion is a fine topic but some people are not so into it um you know people of different religions are like oh i accept everybody i ca- i can accept um humor you know if if it pertains to be or not you know 

114.21 118.48 A: i'm like polish and irish and when i hear polish and irish jokes i laugh i think it's funny 

118.11 119.62 B: yeah yeah [laughter] 

118.91 121.99 A: so i don't know i guess um that some people wouldn't 

122.52 125.17 A: you know accept that as much as others 

124.97 126.15 B: (( right right )) 

125.41 127.64 A: i guess if you're a laid back kind of person 

127.83 129.17 A: anything goes 

129.23 136.12 B: yeah yeah and and i guess it depends on how like how sensitive you are it's like individually um 

134.83 135.70 A: right 

136.24 143.89 A: and what kind of atmosphere does it if it's a party i think a more is acceptable [laughter] than just if you were out to eat you know out to dinner or whatever 

143.49 145.65 B: (( yeah you )) 

146.00 149.87 B: know but there's no i guess there's no like rule where you can say 

149.96 153.39 B: you this this is the line and you cannot ever cross 

153.41 156.54 A: right i don't think so i think you just kinda have to size up your 

157.16 160.71 A: group that you're with [laughter] and go from there 

158.97 160.15 B: right 

161.46 162.73 A: hm 

162.61 163.82 B: yeah 

163.21 170.67 A: i guess television would probably be a lot of um [laughter] a better a better conversation um to talk about that than other 

171.14 173.26 A: you know controversial issues 

172.60 179.25 B: [noise] yeah yeah some- sometimes i think they do draw whatever you cross the line if there were one [laughter] 

178.04 179.80 A: exactly [laughter] 

179.93 180.96 A: yeah 

180.60 189.86 B: yeah they yeah they they do 'cause oh there was that i i'm sure i hope it's not going on air but they were there was somebody c._b._s. i think were going to make a reality show 

189.82 199.90 B: with um [lipsmack] where the were gonna like pick southerners and then like bring them to l._a. and then follow them around i suppose people would think that would be funny but i don't think that's funny at all 

195.44 196.48 A: oh really 

199.54 200.46 A: no 

200.47 202.58 A: [laughter] so are you in florida

237.30 245.77 B: oh yeah so you must find every- i mean a lot of things have to be humorous [laughter] you have to have a good sense of humor [noise] to be a teacher 

242.17 244.09 A: oh yeah yeah nothing 

244.63 249.63 A: nothing can be taken too seriously [laughter] yeah that's true 

249.96 261.79 A: yeah i don't know i just i just think you kinda have to size up your group to see you know who's all kinda around and um you know you could kinda tell by people's body language if they feel uncomfortable in a conversation so you know 

261.89 264.03 A: hey let's not go there 

261.92 262.88 B: right

291.76 293.16 A: you're not into that 

293.54 294.72 A: that's funny 

295.49 296.66 A: (( mm )) 

297.11 301.48 A: so it's just going to be the two of us talking and nobody there's like no moderator or anything 

301.21 314.18 B: no that's it [laughter] they say it's only well from what the email i got was a linguistics oh it was a linguistics study but you know it could be one of those things where they like sometimes they'll bring you in 

302.13 302.95 A: oh 

302.96 304.29 A: that's funny 

314.61 318.74 B: [noise] into it like if i was doing a study and and the participants will think they're 

318.77 324.38 B: studying one thing or they're to be studying one thing but then the people who are running that the 

324.54 327.45 B: the study actually want to look at something totally different 

327.11 328.26 A: right 

327.93 331.42 B: so i wonder i wonder [laughter] but i have no clue 

328.95 331.01 A: yeah [laughter] 

331.26 332.05 A: right 

332.57 342.55 A: mm maybe they wanted to see how people would interact on the call on the telephone for ten minutes [laughter] about racy issues [laughter] huh 

337.69 338.98 B: (( yeah )) 

342.53 349.10 B: it it could be [mn] so yeah that would see now that would be funny [laughter] 

344.88 345.82 A: yeah 

347.35 349.38 A: yeah [laughter] 

349.48 353.07 B: if you know it were something say completely different than like 

352.48 358.27 A: like if you had a businessman on the phone like with a young girl or something and see how they interact that would be funny 

357.48 359.71 B: yeah yeah something like that 

358.40 367.03 A: i mean because he would be like talking about politics and she'd be like [lipsmack] okay [laughter] you know let's talk about partying [laughter] 

364.52 365.84 B: yeah 

366.25 367.38 B: [laughter] 

367.31 372.34 A: you know the- they would definitely have different views on what would be acceptable conversation 

372.52 375.69 B: right right so it could be something totally different i wonder i wonder 

375.38 376.21 A: right 

377.23 377.95 A: hm 

378.96 381.25 B: yeah 'cause i saw a study about uh 

381.39 385.32 B: they they brought people in to watch a movie and so people the the 

385.61 392.61 B: they were in there to critique this movie but they weren't they were really they were seeing how much popcorn they ate while they're watching the movie [laughter] 

392.43 394.35 A: oh that's funny [laughter] 

393.66 395.10 B: yeah so 

394.96 402.01 A: i did a study where they asked us to watch a television show and um they said you know remember as much as possible and then 

402.00 416.96 A: the next day they asked about different things but it was all about the commercials and i'm like i was watching the show [laughter] so i'm like trying to remember everything that happened in the show and they're asking me about gerber commercials i'm like oh no [laughter] i wasn't 

407.42 408.74 B: (( [noise] oh [laughter] )) 

415.21 419.61 B: [laughter] right right so i get well that's the po- that's the point you know 

418.64 421.06 A: exactly how much do you really absorb 

420.84 422.28 B: right 

422.10 423.00 A: so 

423.17 424.04 A: hm 

426.03 429.09 B: but this topic is a lot harder than the other two topics were 

428.89 434.78 A: okay good 'cause i feel like i can't do this anymore [laughter] like i'm here [laughter] 

431.46 433.30 B: me neither [laughter] 

435.03 442.23 B: 'cause you can't really draw back on your experience for humor i mean either you think you're funny or you don't but there's not there's not a whole lot 

441.92 442.75 A: right 

442.46 447.06 B: to really i guess unless you're a comedian so if they had people who did humor for a living 

446.79 447.83 A: right 

447.49 448.87 B: then they could talk about it 

448.82 449.84 A: right 

450.35 461.61 A: but where would we draw the line like if we went to a comedy club where would we draw the line like if they started saying like real racist stuff you would be like annoyed you know 'cause that's not funny you know what i mean when they talk about you know 

461.68 464.35 A: [lipsmack] you know when they go overboard and it's like oh boy 

464.61 469.02 A: 'cause you kind feel comfortable the people around you or you know [laughter] it's like oh no 

468.89 470.51 B: i suppose 

469.92 470.86 A: you know 

470.80 475.20 B: yeah but it get it depends on who's saying it [laughter] i guess and what their point is 

474.99 485.71 A: exactly yeah like eddie murphy can get away with you know a lot and that's funny but like if you're just you know comedy club you know downtown wherever you live you know what i mean you're like oh no 

478.70 479.91 B: yeah 

485.85 487.03 B: yeah 

486.14 488.92 A: they're going to get their butts kicked [laughter] you know 

489.47 492.45 A: so i don't know i think you just i [mn] 

492.66 499.62 A: you know they just look at the crowd and they say you know this is gonna fly and that's not gonna fly you know they depend depending on the area 

500.79 502.64 B: yeah yeah 

502.39 508.25 A: so i'm from up north so [laughter] i have the experience of up north down south we got it all you know 

504.64 505.47 B: (( [mn] )) 

507.86 509.18 B: yeah 

508.88 510.40 A: i think it's all funny 

511.97 512.72 A: hm 

513.93 516.55 B: yeah i i think i think you're right i 

516.64 518.04 B: (( think you're right )) 

518.58 519.58 A: (( i don't know )) 

521.29 524.69 B: so yeah humor is hard [laughter] humor is 

523.30 533.80 A: [laughter] and i think if you're drinking different humor is diff- acceptable [laughter] [mn] yeah 

529.27 530.82 B: [laughter] 

532.87 536.05 B: yeah everything is much funnier [laughter] 

534.58 548.21 A: and if you don't remember everything that you said it's all of a good [laughter] if everybody's laughing and having fun you know 'cause like if you're at the office you're saying different stuff but if you're at a party drinking it's all acceptable pretty much 

548.28 551.93 B: yeah yeah yeah and things are a lot less offensive then too [laughter] 

551.28 554.35 A: yeah it's all you're all amongst friends [laughter] 

553.59 554.33 B: yeah 

554.74 555.65 A: so 

556.37 557.31 A: i don't know 

557.40 558.88 A: this is a hard one 

559.27 559.97 B: (( mm )) 

559.87 561.24 A: this is a hard one 

561.20 567.90 B: yeah i won- yeah i think they i wonder if they change it every day before we were talking about pets and uh what do you 

566.95 568.50 A: oh pets are easy 

568.15 573.91 B: yeah i know it was [laughter] and then um what do you what do you 

574.38 577.68 B: look for in a long term mate i mean you can go on that forever 

577.42 578.96 A: oh yeah 

578.34 580.73 B: so yeah [laughter] 

579.98 588.79 A: why didn't they break me in with those [laughter] instead of like um what is unacceptable and acceptable humor um i don't know 

586.38 587.27 B: yeah 

588.64 590.97 B: just call back tomorrow and see 

591.21 591.94 A: (( yeah )) 

592.03 598.61 A: let me have a few drinks and we'll get some friends together and then we'll talk about humor [laughter] i don't know 'cause that's so vague 

595.68 597.28 B: (( yeah )) 

599.07 599.95 A: like i don't know
