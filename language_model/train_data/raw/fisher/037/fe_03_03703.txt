98.95 100.92 B: i think it's like six twenty five 

100.97 106.44 A: i wonder if the reason their that the that they they bring up the federal minimum wage though is for 

106.81 109.33 A: ah states that are a little more 

109.60 110.73 A: backwards 

111.16 113.05 B: possibly possibly 

112.39 116.65 A: [laughter] 'cause i know that oregon and washington and california tend to you know 

116.61 117.63 B: yeah 

117.02 121.05 A: be a little more liberal in their in their thinking in a lot of lot of times 

119.27 120.38 B: yeah 

121.14 127.57 B: yeah i that kind of disturbs me you know the more that i think about it you know because it's it's not something you think about every day

150.90 152.14 A: yeah 

152.15 153.35 B: that's hard 

153.76 154.59 A: (( mm )) 

155.01 156.62 A: it's kind of um 

157.79 161.02 A: it's interesting that there are some people who don't want to raise it 

161.16 162.88 B: yeah [laughter] 

162.12 165.96 A: like they don't want to be forced to have to pay a certain amount [noise] it's like um 

166.10 168.77 A: (( you know they don't they don't want to pay somebody who's a dishwasher )) 

168.85 169.75 B: mhm 

169.05 170.13 A: more money 

170.11 182.13 B: yeah i i can understand that but i i mean you know from the um you know from the personal s- perspective i mean it's not like it's not [laughter] humane you know 

181.95 182.84 A: right 

182.57 186.38 B: but from like a b- business perspective it's all about you know 

186.40 196.74 B: being as the most efficient that you can be so if there's someone there who will is willing to work for less they go ahead and try to you know get someone who will do the work for less 

196.66 197.95 A: (( [cough] yeah )) 

197.38 199.04 B: even though that's [laughter] 

199.16 201.38 B: i don't see how anyone can survive 

201.65 206.77 A: do you guys have do you have medical coupons in california do you have like state aid welfare 

206.85 212.90 B: um i don't think we do i not that i know of 

212.95 213.91 B: (( in this state )) 

213.23 216.39 A: yeah welfare in washington state 

216.46 218.10 A: pays better than 

218.51 224.18 A: five fifteen an hour like you'd do better yeah and so i think that's why washington state 

219.96 221.79 B: are you serious mm 

224.25 233.02 A: made their minimum wage higher because for for a single mom with one kid to get off of to get off of welfare she'd have to be making at least eight bucks an hour 

233.01 234.37 B: (( uh-huh wow mhm )) 

233.70 237.06 A: that was that they did a study oh i don't remember when it was like 

237.12 239.02 A: years ago like five years ago 

239.47 243.04 A: and that was five years ago that [laughter] they needed to be making eight bucks an hour 

242.14 242.97 B: yeah 

243.38 244.23 A: (( so )) 

243.39 254.15 B: well that's interesting hm that's that's bad because you know there are people i know you know i used to see those people working you know and they're not like 

254.53 257.80 B: i don't know even like in my my university i go to u._c._l._a. 

254.59 255.25 A: [cough] 

257.86 261.30 B: their their food service workers are making less than 

257.91 258.88 A: oh cool 

261.71 265.16 B: i think um they're they start out at like 

265.21 271.20 B: they hiked it up when i started out it was like six seventy five and now they're at seven fifteen they start at seven fifteen 

270.59 275.76 A: [noise] wow which if you're a student maybe that would be like sort of okay if you have sort of a 

271.57 272.64 B: and that's like 

275.96 281.41 A: i mean i i didn't make mu- i made minimum wage when i worked in oregon but you know all i was doing was like 

279.08 279.93 B: (( ah )) 

281.55 284.87 A: giving people donuts you know i mean it was something really easy 

282.79 291.33 B: well well yeah yeah yeah my first job was back in nineteen ninety five and i i made snow cones for four twenty five [laughter] 

291.41 292.38 A: (( [laughter] )) 

291.85 303.96 B: a long time ago but now [laughter] i don't know i don't know if i w- would do that 'cause in the same time you can get like um you know an office job at the university and make at least ten dollars 

297.82 298.94 A: yeah i think it's a 

303.88 306.19 A: yeah well but you have to have some 

306.31 308.41 A: some amount of skill to do that 

308.12 310.03 B: yeah i suppose 

309.41 311.07 A: like you have to be able to read 

310.96 312.85 B: [laughter] true 

311.82 316.11 A: well i mean it's true you know a lot of the people who are working minimum wage jobs are 

313.09 314.08 B: that's true 

316.08 317.02 B: that's true 

316.19 319.75 A: people who might not know how to read or might not speak very good english 

317.72 318.52 B: (( yeah that's true )) 

320.69 325.09 A: so it's a lot harder and there's a lot of people in this country who don't want to pay 

326.23 329.76 A: there's a lot of people in this country who have something against people who 

330.32 336.09 A: don't speak very good english or who don't know how to read you know i mean it's it's very classist 

336.15 337.76 A: sort of annoying 

337.87 340.55 A: viewpoint but there's a lot of american's who are like 

340.58 344.32 A: you know well if you come here you should speak english and it's like well someone has to 

344.70 349.34 A: like make that happen it's not like they're gonna come over here and just immediately know how to speak english 

346.91 348.48 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

348.86 353.24 B: yeah and they need money to go to school [laughter] yeah 

350.85 351.76 A: (( yeah )) 

351.82 357.95 A: that's just that that attitude sort of and i think those are the same people who don't want the minimum wage to go up 

357.35 358.74 B: yeah 

358.43 359.20 A: (( um )) 

359.21 366.90 B: yeah um yeah they um they had they had a law in um the santa monica city i don't know if you heard of santa monica so 

359.37 360.19 A: although

383.54 384.50 A: wow 

390.18 396.63 B: and i i kind of understand that because these hotels you're not going to find a room for under a hundred and fifty dollars 

396.28 397.87 A: (( yeah [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

396.85 398.43 B: and i mean 

398.70 403.36 B: they were making and you were and you and you're you want to pay someone like six dollars an hour to like 

403.69 405.64 B: you know to maintain this place 

405.22 406.52 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

405.78 409.37 B: so there's a there's a lot of beef but it it they get past

419.47 420.99 A: that's great 

425.96 427.17 A: mhm 

426.45 428.62 B: and you're clientele can you know 

428.84 430.16 B: can afford it

430.30 431.09 B: yeah 

432.95 438.40 A: and the bigger places like washington state has a minimum minimum wage that's much higher than the federal one 

435.14 436.03 B: mhm 

437.55 439.27 B: (( mm )) 

438.95 441.64 A: so it seems like the federal one is sort of in place for

485.32 486.27 A: yeah 

489.45 490.39 A: [laughter]
