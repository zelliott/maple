0.25 1.49 A: hello 

1.31 2.35 B: hi 

1.64 4.29 A: [mn] hi i'm owen who are you 

4.00 5.42 B: i'm wendy nice 

4.78 6.81 A: hi nice to meet you [laughter] 

5.97 8.83 B: to meet you too this is my first time ever doing this [laughter] 

8.05 17.81 A: this this is mine too i've actually listened i'm i'm actually a researcher and i've listened to some calls from other collections so i'm familiar with this kind of collection but i've never done one before 

9.42 11.25 B: oh good okay we're newbies 

16.74 19.35 B: oh okay all righty [laughter] 

18.23 18.79 A: (( [cough] )) 

19.16 20.80 A: so 

20.63 25.79 B: so humor unacceptable not acceptable what are your views [laughter] 

23.24 27.92 A: hu- right [laughter] well i haven't thought a lot about it uh 

27.36 32.64 B: me either except i do have chil- young children and sometimes some of their humor can be 

29.83 31.31 A: right 

32.74 36.15 B: a little unacceptable in my views for their age levels 

35.62 37.22 A: that's right 

36.50 40.82 B: so i don't know if that's the type of thing they're looking for or if they're looking more at adults [laughter] 

38.80 39.78 A: well that's 

40.74 47.29 A: yeah well they're both interesting questions i i'm in the same situation i've got a a six and a three year old and the six year old [sigh] 

45.81 46.71 B: (( sure oh )) 

47.63 59.68 A: is the kind of kid who likes to push limits and that's a a great way to push limits is to find words that are i mean there's some words that are this this i'm not sure this qualifies as humor but it it certainly cracks him up to uh 

54.19 55.21 B: yep 

57.18 58.55 B: [laughter] 

58.67 61.02 B: [laughter] oh of course [laughter] 

60.70 63.71 A: say naughty words and and find out where the line is 

63.18 73.63 B: yeah i've got an eight year old and a six year old and my six year old seems to be more of the ambitious one when it comes to pushing those type of limits but i think she learns a lot from the eight year old so 

73.23 76.52 A: right right [laughter] 

73.77 75.41 B: (( you know [laughter] )) 

75.60 88.00 B: i guess with them when something's just not appropriate i i just kinda look at them or i say hey you know we can't say that out and about or you know stuff like that but [sigh] um i don't know [laughter] what about what do you do with your children mhm 

83.70 84.66 A: uh-huh 

87.16 96.54 A: well i i do that and then when we have a a a time out system for you know behavior that really persists and so 

95.47 96.25 B: yeah 

96.71 110.71 A: we we give time outs for it even you know and i've found that with him it you have to be very consistent you can't make a big argument or anything you know if he says the word that's a time out you know no no negotiation no emotion and [sigh] so 

102.73 103.61 B: oh 

106.38 107.65 B: exactly 

110.17 118.68 B: yeah with children consistency is definitely a good thing and trying not to react too much to something even though you wanna go ooh you know [laughter] 

117.02 124.24 A: right right apparently that that's a big reinforcer for you know the behaviorists psychologists say you've gotta [sigh] stay very calm 

121.02 122.60 B: oh yes [laughter] 

123.05 131.73 B: if they get any kind of a reaction then that's it you're done for [laughter] um as far as adults and things i know sometimes my father can 

126.52 127.53 A: right 

127.61 130.35 A: right 

132.06 136.07 B: his his attempt of humor is not necessarily humor i want my children 

136.15 140.04 B: repeating [laughter] he he's old school that's all i'll say [laughter] 

136.98 138.03 A: uh-huh 

138.76 140.42 A: uh-huh right 

140.00 152.72 B: and again with him i'll just give him a look or say hey you know dad not in front of the kids or this or that and i i really try and look at my children and okay did they even pick up on that is it something even worth you know mentioning or saying you know 

145.43 146.43 A: mhm 

152.31 161.23 A: mhm now is that things like um sort of profane humor or uh slurs on particular uh-huh 

152.88 153.58 B: so 

156.83 158.00 B: no 

158.80 160.00 B: (( yeah )) 

160.17 162.08 B: races and things yeah 

161.37 162.46 A: right 

162.09 163.09 B: (( yes mm )) 

162.48 171.69 A: which it's kind of an interesting question i mean when they called and said comedy is the and i looked up what the topic was about i thought a little bit about it and there's 

171.86 173.07 A: um 

173.08 185.36 A: you know [mn] th- there's there's ethnic slurs which are a a a great tradition in comedy [laughter] but are now very frowned upon you know and i i pretty much agree with that that it's not not a great thing but you find 

178.61 179.51 B: yes 

182.20 183.17 B: right 

185.31 193.14 A: within ethnic groups people it's a great source of comedy still i mean blacks will you know call each other nigger and they'll 

190.07 190.85 B: yes 

193.20 198.25 A: uh you know they they and that's that's okay and other groups do the same thing i think 

195.56 196.27 B: (( [mn] )) 

196.90 206.95 B: it it's one of those things about you know hey i i can joke about my mother but don't you dare say anything about her you know i mean i think it kinda lies upon the same lines there you know if you're making a joke 

201.45 202.69 A: that's right 

206.78 214.39 B: that has something to do with yourself or your background or your nature that's acceptable but when someone else who's not 

211.27 212.37 A: right 

214.53 225.87 B: in that race or family or whatever says something you know it's like you know picking on your brother or somebody you know [laughter] you can pick on him all you want but when somebody else comes along you're probably gonna stand up for 

218.53 219.60 A: right 

221.31 223.01 A: mhm 

225.45 234.94 A: yeah yeah i guess it's the same psychological phenomena it's it's interesting that people have that strong reaction and and there's it the it came to mind when i i saw a review 

226.03 227.05 B: (( him you know mm )) 

234.93 240.70 A: uh there's a new movie out i guess and i can't even remember the title of it but it's the the plot is 

240.77 252.14 A: um what is it there's a there's a a beverly hills or some some rich white family who's in the the the father's a politician and the son is into hip hop and it's ruining his political career 

251.39 253.32 B: [laughter] 

252.23 265.92 A: and they they kidnap him and take him to a a true ghetto and uh so i don't know what the rest is but the apparently the reaction that it's having in some quarters is that [sigh] you know this is white people making fun of black culture and it's really 

263.72 264.39 B: mhm 

265.35 267.73 B: it probably is not going to go over very well 

266.82 271.99 A: yeah i saw some headlines that said you know is this the new minstrel show of of white people 

271.37 272.51 B: wow 

272.09 279.17 A: and uh but then it also reminded me i guess there was a a spike lee movie i don't know some number of years back where 

279.23 284.33 A: it was about uh well anyway i guess it was you know he he was 

284.82 288.93 A: he i actually can't i didn't see that movie either [laughter] but he uh there's 

288.20 289.76 B: malcolm x. or something 

289.26 296.29 A: no no it wasn't a seri- it was something about minstrel i think it might have had minstrel in the title and uh the plot was that um 

293.51 294.54 B: okay 

296.34 297.24 A: there were 

297.34 304.78 A: well this is actually a little bit different point isn't it but the the there were black people acting out old time minstrel show 

299.79 300.74 B: [laughter] 

304.27 305.53 B: right 

304.90 309.94 A: uh and that got a that got a reaction i mean but here was a black guy making 

306.10 306.77 B: (( [noise] )) 

310.32 313.00 A: (( uh [mn] you know )) 

312.97 315.54 B: fun of situations that they don't want brought up again 

314.98 317.80 A: right yeah so 

315.56 317.24 B: yeah yeah 

317.51 323.64 B: the whole slave issue and that kind of stuff yeah well i i guess different people view things different ways and [sigh] 

319.22 320.47 A: right 

323.85 335.60 B: i guess they they wanna try and find out what to do about it you know depending on the situation if it's a good friend and they're saying something you know then maybe i'll just say something to 'em or i just walk away or you know 

327.14 329.00 A: mhm 

335.48 337.00 A: mhm 

335.97 340.19 B: 'cause they i think the the topic was more your reaction to it wasn't it 

339.94 342.78 A: uh yeah right [laughter] 

340.90 342.15 B: [laughter] 

343.97 345.24 B: but i don't 

344.03 348.49 A: right the other thing i i the other thing that comes to mind is um 

348.79 353.71 A: and it's not really an offensive humor but i guess in bad taste i i i've noticed that 

352.82 353.97 B: (( mhm )) 

353.81 366.73 A: with my friends you know with with very old friends i have a few friends you know college buddies and and even earlier where we know each other well and we uh you know we we call it abuse of each other we we make fun of each other 

358.43 359.07 B: (( mm )) 

366.24 367.24 B: right 

366.72 371.83 A: and you you with someone you know that well it's it's you know that's how you bond sort of 

370.90 375.29 B: yes yes i completely understand i have friends from college like that too [laughter] 

372.81 374.04 A: right 

374.28 379.04 A: sure but then i've i've known other people who um 

379.47 382.99 A: who have that sort of sense of humor but you don't know them quite as well 

382.51 383.46 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

383.15 391.99 A: and and you know as someone who who has been in this the sort i appreciate that sort of humor when i'm when i feel close enough to the person but i've i've known people who 

391.98 400.25 A: i don't know as well and they they make these jokes and you sort of you have to say okay he's probably just being friendly but it seems a little abusive 'cause i don't know him that well 

397.28 398.19 B: yeah 

399.45 403.82 B: [laughter] well i i can fully relate to that because i've recently moved 

403.44 404.37 A: uh-huh 

403.74 408.33 B: we had some really good friends and you could joke and say anything at all to them you know about anything 

408.16 418.96 B: and um i've got some new friends now that i'm up here and i find myself kinda thinking okay i shouldn't say that because they don't know me that well yet and you know how are they gonna react if i say something you know [laughter] [noise] 

414.92 416.71 A: right right 

417.62 425.72 A: right right and and you're also with new friends you're not sure when they'll detect you're if you're being sarcastic or not or when you're kidding them 

424.03 430.74 B: exactly exactly since they don't know your tones and your body language and how you you know say things or whatnot so 

428.90 432.54 A: mhm where where have you moved to what what area are you in 

431.57 442.29 B: um we're up in the new york area we moved up from pennsylvania so not too huge of a move or anything like that but but big enough it's the first time i'm ever really away from my family so 

433.61 434.57 A: uh-huh 

435.07 436.30 A: oh okay 

441.83 446.57 A: oh boy that's a big change are you in uh near the city or in upstate new york or 

443.29 444.08 B: (( very )) 

445.96 449.20 B: um we're in uh more close to rochester 

448.77 455.58 A: oh okay i i went to school in rochester so i yeah i know some of that area yeah 

450.56 453.93 B: oh really okay well small world [laughter] 

454.82 457.40 B: no we moved up here for my husband's job so 

457.02 458.03 A: uh-huh 

457.76 458.77 B: (( you know )) 

458.66 460.31 A: (( yeah )) 

459.90 462.22 B: [sigh] all righty so [laughter] 

461.56 466.93 A: so what else is there to say about comedy and it's the limits of good taste 

463.33 470.59 B: [laughter] comedy is yeah um i think it's funny sometimes when you're watching old movies or whatever and 

471.06 471.91 B: (( you know )) 

472.01 481.46 B: things that were acceptable back then that you know just were commonplace because that's how people still were at the time you know getting back to racial things and things like that and to see it these days 

477.32 478.37 A: mhm 

481.38 493.55 B: you kinda look at it and go oh my god you know [laughter] like they were they were allowed to say those kind of things those things were acceptable or whereas today i guess we're just so much more politically correct that we ever were before 

484.16 485.43 A: yeah 

488.45 489.63 A: right 

492.24 494.12 A: th- that's right 

493.79 504.03 B: sometimes i think people go too far with the politically correctness stuff as well you know i mean it's one thing to to be thinking out of you know thinking of other people and things like that but sometimes i don't 

496.70 499.00 A: mhm 

504.17 510.03 B: know sometimes i think they just push it to the limits a little too much like you can't say this and you can't say that you can't do this or you know 

509.05 519.39 A: that's right right and it keeps it it keeps changing i guess it i don't know maybe it's slowed down a little bit but in the eighties it seemed like it was just i saw a there was an eddie murphy 

513.43 514.25 B: (( i think it's )) 

519.41 526.37 A: uh video of him doing a just a live standup act and i remember when i first saw it i thought wow this is you know this is hilarious i was younger too 

521.93 522.90 B: (( oh uh-huh )) 

525.85 528.77 B: no of course we our views all change [laughter] 

526.52 527.61 A: and then i 

527.85 533.78 A: yeah and i i rented it again with some other friends oh this is this great video and there was all this humor about um 

533.91 535.73 A: gay people i mean he sort of 

535.21 536.05 B: (( mm )) 

535.66 537.63 A: (( [mn] and )) 

537.48 551.38 A: it was still kind of funny part of it was that it was just older but it was also like you know this is less acceptable and then i realized you know what is this five years has gone past and i've i've been p._c. sensitized that i'm no longer allowed to laugh at these jokes [laughter] i mean i mean it was my genuine 

540.16 541.15 B: yeah exactly 

544.67 545.74 B: mhm 

549.34 550.68 B: [laughter] 

551.53 553.08 A: feeling but uh 

552.62 554.58 B: right right oh i know 

554.58 561.50 A: and uh the the other thing about uh you know if you watch old movies and things it it some of it 

561.86 563.15 A: um 

563.36 566.55 A: i haven't [mn] what am i thinking about um [cough] 

566.88 569.89 A: i saw something on t._v. about amos and andy 

569.49 570.36 B: okay 

569.99 577.75 A: and i think that was originally on the radio and i think it was actually done by white uh actors doing you know this extreme 

575.59 576.61 B: oh really 

577.88 580.81 A: caricatured black um 

579.10 581.49 B: right prototype accent type 

580.78 582.47 A: yeah black accent 

582.42 592.20 A: and and then i guess when it went to t._v. or movies or wherever it went it they they hired black actors to do the same thing but you know the whole thing has been thrown out because it was 

586.51 587.08 B: (( mm )) 

589.11 589.86 B: right 

592.08 599.90 A: i mean we there's no am- amos and andy on any broadcasts anywhere now or or revivals 'cause it's it's all basically this racist humor of 

596.35 597.18 B: no 

599.25 599.90 B: mhm
