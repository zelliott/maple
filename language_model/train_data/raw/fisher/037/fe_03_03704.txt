0.50 3.17 B: (( hello ah this is hello this is scott )) 

0.86 2.05 A: hello 

3.45 5.04 A: this is bobby 

5.10 6.69 B: how you doing 

6.24 8.32 A: okay and yourself 

7.99 10.18 B: good good 

10.16 11.47 A: that's good 

12.35 15.51 B: (( ah so the minimum wage what do you think )) 

15.32 17.04 A: i think it should be raised 

17.30 19.46 A: much higher than what it is now 

19.21 20.56 B: (( really what )) 

20.18 21.32 A: mhm 

20.84 22.19 B: do you think it should be 

23.56 28.28 A: at least seven seven dollars an hour really i do yes 

25.95 26.83 B: really 

29.25 32.50 B: i i disagree with you i don't think there should be a minimum wage 

34.35 36.07 B: but ah i think ah 

36.27 43.72 B: some of the younger kids and and teenagers need to be able to work and i don't think they need to make that much money 

45.98 46.84 B: hello 

46.90 48.90 A: yeah i'm here i'm here 

47.86 51.27 B: oh okay i i thought i heard a click i didn't know if you're still there or not 

50.28 52.57 A: no i'm just listening [laughter] 

51.75 59.66 B: [laughter] okay i think ah people should be paid what they're what they're worth and if ah they can't um 

60.29 65.26 B: ah prove that they're worth minimum wage then they should make less than win- minimum wage 

66.16 69.08 A: well don't you think then that they should be just let go 

69.60 71.33 B: what's that they should be let go 

71.23 74.79 A: mhm if they're not wor- you know if they're not worth paying 

72.03 73.83 B: um 

74.54 78.10 B: yeah i think and i think that's what happens i think some people actually let go 

78.39 80.76 B: um because they 

81.13 82.18 B: um 

82.26 84.02 B: are not worth the minimum wage 

84.66 86.00 B: (( i don't know i )) 

86.56 90.81 B: mean you know i i don't know that the minimum wage does what it's supposed to do which is to 

90.94 92.37 B: you know increase 

93.02 97.74 B: um the standard of living i guess for people and i think it tends to 

95.87 96.51 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

97.96 102.86 B: raise prices for everybody and kind of defeats the purpose in the long run 

101.10 102.19 A: that's 

102.70 109.45 A: that was my reason for saying that because everything has gotten so high including gas and 

110.45 118.25 A: you know i mean gas here is like a dollar forty something and it was um just lately it was like in the fif- a dollar fifty 

113.79 114.89 B: yeah yeah 

117.84 119.00 B: yeah 

118.90 122.18 A: and you know just everything has gone up 

121.72 122.89 B: yeah 

122.60 124.51 A: and it's hard to 

124.55 127.14 A: you know make it on 

127.40 129.65 A: i would say that amount of money 

129.20 133.19 B: oh yeah i would say it's impossible to make it on on minimum wage 

133.03 137.57 A: like you know like you said um teenagers young people 

137.11 138.38 B: mhm 

137.77 143.84 A: you know those that are eighteen and working to try to go to college and be out on their own 

143.50 144.34 B: sure 

143.95 146.38 A: it would be impossible for them to 

147.30 158.57 A: make it on five fifteen an hour so [noise] i agree with what you said too that you know the person should be paid what they- they're worth and what the employer would like to pay them 

155.51 156.44 B: mhm 

158.25 159.57 B: right 

160.06 160.97 A: they're 

161.06 164.89 A: i agree with that i've never thought of it in that way but 

165.25 172.77 A: yeah an- and then because the person the employ- -ployees they would have their own choice of whether they want to stay or go 

172.48 173.75 B: sure sure 

173.99 176.27 B: yeah i i think um [noise] 

177.79 184.33 B: [mn] well i i think you're right that you can't live off minimum wage and um i think um 

184.55 185.87 B: you know if you're 

186.11 191.57 B: an adult and you're only making minimum wage then there's probably something may be something else [laughter] wrong with 

191.73 198.85 B: um you should be making more than that you should be worth more than that certainly to anybody yeah there's no doubt 

195.62 197.20 A: right 

198.11 203.53 A: and just like waitresses they're only paid like if they're even paid hourly 

203.13 204.35 B: yeah 

203.76 208.58 A: they're only paid like anywhere from a dollar something to maybe three dollars 

207.96 209.86 B: yeah that seems ridiculous 

208.77 212.33 A: and then they have to depend on their tips and that's hard to do 

212.02 213.75 B: yeah that seems ridiculous 

212.66 215.50 A: because you cannot make a budget that way 

215.12 216.31 B: mhm 

215.97 220.95 A: or anything and it's just you know you just don't know what you're going to have from day to day 

220.48 221.65 B: mhm 

221.26 223.97 A: and that would drive me nuts [laughter] 

222.80 230.70 B: yeah i it's hard to imagine that that people are allow- you know that that live off of that but there are people that do so 

231.40 232.60 B: (( i don't know )) 

232.39 235.02 A: [noise] you sometimes wonder how they do it [noise] 

234.57 242.84 B: yeah yeah certainly and definitely there's a lot of those people there's ah a lot of waitresses and a lot of waiters and whatever that 

243.12 246.56 B: make very little money and still are able to [noise] live off of that yeah 

246.46 247.46 A: right 

247.51 254.28 A: i mean probably i was i would assume that more than half of like people that are waitresses um 

254.60 259.66 A: have you know is married and has a husband you know and they're just like 

256.87 258.94 B: yeah yeah you'd have to be 

259.75 262.43 A: working to bring a little income into the house 

262.20 263.47 B: sure true 

262.83 266.90 A: i don't really think there's that many waitresses unless it's a very 

267.77 272.63 A: exclusive place where you do get large amount of tips you know 

270.47 271.21 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

272.76 274.78 A: live by themselves 

273.99 275.64 B: sure sure 

276.36 281.24 A: [noise] i i just feel that five [noise] fifteen an hour is just [noise] 

283.64 284.92 B: yeah it's awfully low 

285.34 286.74 A: right 

285.84 287.74 B: be very difficult to um 

288.06 295.34 B: i guess to to live off of that or to pay rent or ah have a family or any any type off of that amount of money [noise] 

295.27 299.44 A: right myself i'm on um social security disability 

299.38 300.18 B: okay 

300.13 301.39 A: and 

301.68 310.11 A: they only paid me 'cause i'm only forty six so i don't get a large amount because they go by the number of years that you worked 

304.46 305.31 B: mhm 

306.66 307.48 B: sure 

309.50 310.35 B: sure 

310.22 314.53 A: and it's hard to live off of um seven sixty a month 

314.20 316.42 B: oh i bet that's almost impossible 

316.26 320.86 A: it's it's very hard to we have to like okay this month i'm going to do this 

320.96 323.17 A: next month i'll pay this one [laughter] 

323.02 325.12 B: yeah i bet that's almost impossible 

323.57 327.67 A: you know and it's it's very hard it's very hard 

326.17 326.95 B: yeah 

328.04 334.81 A: and [noise] they expect me also to take two hundred and fifty six dollars of that 

335.72 339.37 A: i have to pay that in order to have insurance for the month 

339.90 341.38 B: (( yeah really )) 

341.04 342.21 A: mhm 

341.96 344.00 B: for ah what kind of insurance 

344.53 346.34 A: (( [lipsmack] [mn] ah medicaid )) 

346.18 347.36 B: really 

347.16 348.25 A: mhm 

348.45 349.56 B: jeez 

349.47 355.05 A: and you know y- you have to do it because i'm on i have seventeen different prescriptions 

354.61 356.34 B: (( yeah what else are you going to do )) 

356.48 361.30 A: yeah you know and then they're taking their amount out you there's nothing left 

360.91 362.59 B: yeah 

361.59 365.02 A: by the time you pay rent and stuff it's ridiculous 

365.68 367.31 B: that sounds um 

367.50 368.98 B: almost impossible 

368.95 372.29 A: and then they wonder why there's so much crime and everything 

371.93 372.80 B: sure 

372.86 374.22 B: where where do you live 

374.60 376.52 A: i'm in ohio toledo

391.40 392.67 A: is it really 

391.98 395.87 B: yeah my wife's been doing it a couple of times and she talked me into doing it so 

395.88 397.37 B: this is my first one 

397.13 399.61 A: this is um like my third 

399.43 400.23 B: okay 

400.31 401.63 A: yeah 

401.88 407.17 B: 'cause it s- seems like kind of a strange deal i don't quite understand what they're doing with all the stuff but 

406.86 408.44 A: [laughter] 

407.54 410.88 B: [laughter] as long as they give their ten dollars tha- that'll be fine 

410.66 414.16 A: right ha- have you has your wife received anything 

413.75 420.90 B: ah i don't think she has i think she did her first ah one i don't know a couple of days ago or today and 

421.28 425.18 B: and has done another one so no i we haven't got anything yet but 

424.66 428.42 A: yeah the topics are definitely interesting at times 

425.23 426.53 B: she does um 

428.15 429.52 B: what's that 

429.04 430.56 A: the topics 

429.81 431.84 B: oh yeah certainly 

431.72 432.66 A: yeah 

432.79 434.01 B: (( um [mn] )) 

434.22 436.40 B: my wife does a lot of um 

436.89 440.05 B: other things like different kinds of shops 

440.43 448.28 B: where they they pay her to go to you know kmart or whatever and shop for a couple of things or pay her to go out to eat 

448.52 451.66 A: right i've seen that i've seen that [noise] 

449.01 450.13 B: she has ah 

451.14 453.59 B: yeah so we do that quite a bit 

453.54 462.01 A: [mn] see my problem is that i don't have the money to go out to eat or [laughter] you know even though they're going to pay you back i i don't have that you know 

457.88 458.58 B: but 

459.75 460.64 B: yeah 

461.07 462.00 B: sure 

462.03 465.83 B: yeah and if you don't have it to start out with it's tough but um they 

465.32 466.52 A: right 

465.94 467.51 B: most of 'em will pay 

467.72 479.73 B: pay for your meal and maybe a little bit more depending on what you order and um but we just you know we we figure we get a free meal out of the deal and fill out a survey and it's it's worth it 

479.31 480.53 A: yeah 

480.55 485.12 B: [lipsmack] and this deal seems to be worth it it's you know ten bucks for what is it ten minutes 

484.98 486.03 A: mhm 

485.65 487.23 B: that seems like a good deal 

487.21 488.25 A: (( yup )) 

488.58 489.79 B: if you do that enough 

488.69 494.07 A: it's there's a lot of different different things down there on the internet to do 

493.75 497.77 B: yeah yeah well you probably got to do some of things from ah 

497.70 501.54 A: yes that's one of the reasons i got into this [laughter] 

497.93 498.77 B: (( the point )) 

501.09 502.49 B: yeah you'd have to 

502.34 505.98 A: 'cause you know everything every little bit helps so 

505.14 505.93 B: yeah 

506.11 508.32 B: what did you do before you went on social security 

508.27 512.78 A: i was um a medical data ent- entry operator 

511.67 512.53 B: okay 

512.62 513.75 B: yeah 

513.95 515.52 A: for nursing homes 

515.28 516.86 B: yeah 

517.24 518.18 B: wow 

517.70 519.05 A: (( [noise] so )) 

519.98 524.83 A: yeah which i loved i loved the job it was i hated it when i had to quit but 

524.22 525.44 B: yeah 

525.91 529.06 A: [mn] it was for safety sakes [mn] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

528.11 530.41 B: yeah yeah 

530.69 533.10 B: well i work at a insurance company so i 

533.92 536.64 B: some of that stuff i i know about but 

538.57 547.03 A: that's something i have to try to look into [laughter] which i don't know it's just 

541.37 542.68 B: [laughter] 

547.15 549.99 A: the government is totally screwed up i think 

549.52 555.78 B: yeah well yo- you know it's it's too bad you you pay in to the social security and then 

556.30 559.23 B: ah when you need it it's really not enough to even 

559.86 562.95 B: be worth it you know it doesn't it pays you some but it doesn't 

563.18 566.06 B: sure as doesn't protect you like you'd like 

565.83 567.01 A: right 

568.33 569.40 A: (( yup )) 

569.11 572.32 B: it now i think you'd you'd be better off you know buying 

572.46 580.88 B: paying into some other insurance that actually paid you know private insurance that actually paid off something that was worth it you know 

580.74 581.89 A: mhm 

581.56 586.90 B: like i i have a disability plan that i pay into that so if i ever go on disability 

587.28 588.89 B: you know i'll get 

589.24 592.13 B: something like eighty percent of my current salary 

592.44 596.03 B: which [mn] a lot more than what social security would ever pay so 

595.74 596.78 A: right 

596.41 599.74 B: that's something you can almost you know that's something you could live off of and
