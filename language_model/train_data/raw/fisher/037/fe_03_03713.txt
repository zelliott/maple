20.91 22.09 B: not even

25.78 28.05 A: [laughter] 

26.86 33.16 B: i i think no matter where you live and i- in larger cities i think even 

33.39 35.09 B: ten isn't enough 

34.85 35.81 A: okay 

35.63 41.52 B: um well that's what four hundred dollars a week if you work you gotta pay daycare [lipsmack] 

36.06 42.07 A: mhm mhm mhm i know 

41.99 46.94 B: um a- [sigh] and then there's nothing left for insurance or 

47.45 51.91 B: ah gas or whatever i just don't think it's adequate at all 

47.90 49.07 A: right 

50.46 59.98 A: right yeah i know and healthcare is outrageous so you know what i'm saying people can't even afford to pay for heal- they don't healthcare it anymore mhm

62.60 64.49 B: (( but so [noise] )) 

62.96 65.63 A: yeah so um hm 

65.91 72.43 A: (( [sigh] i i don't know that they f- ah but boy i wonder what they're gonna do about that )) 

72.10 76.90 B: i don't know i can't believe it's stayed at five fifteen as long as it has 

76.47 77.43 A: mm 

77.43 78.73 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

79.07 82.72 B: i think was it five years ago maybe when it went 

81.62 87.97 A: mhm and some places it's seven you know so seven is not too bad 

82.92 84.22 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

87.27 88.90 B: it's moving but 

89.18 96.23 B: here in iowa it is it's still at five fifteen i mean they just haven't budged at all 

92.23 93.90 A: (( great oh )) 

95.93 98.24 A: i think it's five fifty here 

98.18 99.52 B: yeah 

98.67 99.51 A: yeah 

100.11 110.59 B: [sigh] and it's it's a [sigh] um [lipsmack] i guess if you're a high school student it's okay to to work for that but if you've got a family there's just no way 

100.12 101.23 A: mhm 

103.11 103.83 A: (( mhm )) 

109.42 113.97 A: [sigh] you're not going to make it right right 

110.88 112.08 B: to survive 

112.37 121.04 B: to me it's a social issue that it it makes people have to choose whether to be on welfare or to work i mean 

120.36 125.01 A: (( mhm )) 

121.22 125.22 B: it's it's probably more worth it to stay at home 

124.88 137.41 A: and that's why a lot of people do exactly you're right and this is w- w- w- what is it worth you know some woman that has some baby you're paying it a hundred i heard daycare is a hundred and fifty dollars a child 

126.40 127.48 B: yes [noise] 

137.23 147.50 B: oh yes e- especially little ones and then you don't even know if they're good i mean some of 'em here in iowa you don't even have to be registered it's not mandatory 

138.14 141.09 A: [sigh] oh god 

147.64 149.92 B: in daycare at all 

148.63 153.07 A: that's that's not good that's not good 

150.39 151.30 B: no 

153.13 155.58 B: so it's it's a real problem 

153.43 155.06 A: (( oh my good- )) 

155.23 158.56 A: yeah yeah yeah 

157.08 163.44 B: [lipsmack] and and i guess the other side too is uh businesses then you have to figure out how 

163.95 168.20 B: do you deal with [sigh] the little businesses that can't [mn] 

168.23 174.27 B: they're gonna fight it saying they won't be able to stay in business if they have to pay a higher wage [sigh] 

174.07 175.55 A: okay 

175.05 180.89 B: um my ah one of my friends owns a business and she 

181.06 182.26 B: (( she ah )) 

182.40 188.00 B: said right now if she pays someone ten dollars an hour she feels like she has to 

188.28 195.69 B: i- it's it comes out to about fifteen dollars an hour because she has to pay for work comp insurance and 

191.42 192.35 A: (( [sigh] )) 

196.01 197.11 B: um 

197.73 205.24 B: [lipsmack] all kinds of other r- social security taxes and different things for them that doesn't even include their benefits 

202.41 203.73 A: oh 

205.10 207.30 A: (( right right )) 

205.91 207.18 B: and so 

207.26 212.23 B: she's she would she does pay more than minimum wage but i can see that [lipsmack] 

212.46 216.77 B: you know some businesses that are really on a shoestring will fight this 

216.80 219.65 B: really hard but i- i think it's got to be done 

216.90 220.85 A: (( mhm )) 

220.04 223.75 B: especially with the ah reform to welfare 

224.24 226.51 B: i don't know what they call it now but 

225.43 228.62 A: [mn] that's what it's called mhm mhm mhm 

226.84 228.54 B: the welfare yeah it's 

228.91 231.99 B: uh i when i was young i had to 

232.05 234.15 B: ah be on welfare 

234.62 237.56 B: i was a single parent and ah 

236.21 237.81 A: mhm 

237.69 243.52 B: it's not a fun life but i think i probably was better off than five fifteen an hour 

243.43 249.89 A: (( because at least y- y- a- a- at least i- if you're on welfare y- y- you're getting a medicaid well )) 

249.52 250.55 B: (( yes [sigh] )) 

250.11 257.66 A: medicaid y- you're hospital bills are paid y- y- you're getting food stamps you know your rent is getting paid 

255.60 258.88 B: there's plenty to eat yes [laughter] 

258.04 261.21 A: so why would i want to work [laughter] 

260.57 264.17 B: for a hundred and sixty dollars a week i don't think so 

262.45 264.97 A: oh right 

264.50 271.76 B: i think that was way back my oldest daughter is nineteen years old now so it was nineteen years ago 

272.00 279.09 B: and i think at that time i was getting three hundred and eighty six dollars a month 

278.78 279.83 A: (( mm )) 

279.26 284.13 B: that was that long ago so so f- at minimum wage they're probably 

283.95 284.82 A: mm 

284.39 285.87 B: barely making 

286.00 288.36 B: what what you'd get for a check 

287.77 289.16 A: (( mm mm )) 

288.99 294.88 B: and then they wonder why people don't want to get off of it [laughter] you know that's just not fair 

291.58 292.89 A: right 

292.95 293.86 A: right 

294.43 300.62 A: mhm and i even know people too because i know some people work for like eight fifty an hour 

300.14 300.94 B: yes 

300.74 305.40 A: and a lot of the girls that have babies they keep their medicaid 

305.38 307.93 B: yes 'cause they're just barely 

306.81 309.77 A: not only for the kids but for themselves 

309.16 310.56 B: yeah 

310.50 311.19 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

311.55 319.28 B: [sigh] who is and and i guess the government's gotta just figure out that [mn] one way or the other it's gon- they're gon- 

319.85 324.50 B: i- i- [sigh] if they don't put it onto the businesses then the government's gonna have to pay 

320.07 321.39 A: w- 

324.35 325.66 A: right 

324.78 330.79 B: and i think the businesses are just the ones that are gonna have to raise it up to make it livable 

330.59 343.16 A: oh why don't they make like some kind of a business ah how should i say [lipsmack] um give 'em some kinda perks you know what i'm saying gi- l- lower the taxes for the businesses or something 

341.61 342.59 B: yeah 

342.85 343.94 B: somehow 

343.44 344.62 A: you know 

344.69 358.97 A: just so everybody can survive but maybe i'm thinking that when they do this this research here maybe i- it's some kind of a way that they can get it to the president and and then you know 

356.96 358.04 B: mhm 

358.87 362.47 B: just us regular people talking about what we think yeah i 

360.77 363.16 A: (( right right )) 

362.75 363.73 B: think 

363.43 374.72 A: right and if the people that are making the hundred thousand or more you know if they can pay some more taxes i mean come on these people have been getting breaks for years gi- 

364.16 365.29 B: (( i think so )) 

371.43 372.41 B: yes 

374.13 375.29 B: (( i know )) 

374.85 378.43 A: g- g- g- give us a chance here 

377.59 384.62 B: well the wealth is not distributed at all the the wealthiest keep getting more and more and more wealthy 

383.30 384.34 A: (( i know )) 

384.67 390.80 B: and the middle middle and lower keep getting lower and lower and lower the gap's getting bigger 

386.65 387.80 A: (( i know )) 

389.30 397.56 A: mhm but something's gonna have to happen kathy because listen if the mo- the movie tickets are ten dollars and which they're probably gonna go up more 

395.51 396.42 B: [laughter] 

397.35 404.95 A: if you gotta pay anywhere from fifteen ninety nine to twenty dollars for a c._d. what do you think people are gonna start doing 

404.67 405.91 B: mhm 

405.25 415.52 A: they're gonna stop all of the stuff and and cable's going up i'm hearing you know people are gonna cut all this stuff out and then then what th- then they're gonna feel the crunch 

410.11 410.97 B: [sigh] 

413.95 416.05 B: then the jobs are gone yeah 

415.75 421.50 A: they'll feel the crunch then yeah oh i don't know 

419.22 420.31 B: yes 

421.19 428.36 B: i don't know what the answer is either but i just don't think that that's a fair wage [mn] no matter 

429.08 431.47 B: no matter wh- what you're doing 

431.56 433.30 A: right right 

432.27 434.77 B: i'm it's just not enough 

434.07 442.17 A: but just like y- just like i said i me- i mean ten dollars is not a lot but even if you say to someone even if you make ten dollars an a- a- an hour 

442.30 444.94 A: i- i- is is much better than that 

444.55 446.30 B: yes yeah 

445.19 455.78 A: you know and even if you don't [lipsmack] have some kind of a um insurance plan you can probably find something on the side you know outside because i know there's something called the prescription um 

452.47 453.20 B: right 

456.02 458.28 A: or the p- people's prescription 

457.70 459.40 B: yes i've heard of that 

458.78 467.17 A: well it's very good i have it and i have the dental as well and they have like their own dentist that you go to and you know they have their little list 

467.00 476.74 A: and it helps and every prescription that you get for the people's um f- f- for the ah the d- th- they have the dental and then they have the prescription right 

476.37 477.46 B: mhm 

476.84 481.95 A: every prescription you get five dollars off kathy come on you can do your own little thing on the side 

481.36 482.56 B: (( mhm [lipsmack] )) 

481.97 493.45 A: you don't ha- and you pay seven ninety f- ninety five or nine ninety five p- people are not gonna to be going to do their jobs getting these health plans because it's i- th- that do- that's not worth it either [sigh] 

492.88 503.36 B: oh no my husband if he wanted to get his the best policy that he could get would be i think we would have to pay almost five hundred dollars a month and 

503.31 513.22 B: then ah his his employer would have to pay about a thousand dollars a month for fifteen hundred dollars a month for health insurance 

508.59 509.30 A: (( mhm )) 

512.07 514.65 A: (( mhm no )) 

513.52 515.96 B: there's a problem we need to 

515.01 515.74 A: no 

516.19 528.59 B: you wanna tell me a pill to manufacture a pill costs uh ten dollars a pill it's probably costing them two cents to make the pill and they just rake in the money and 

522.98 524.14 A: (( [sigh] )) 

526.21 528.24 A: (( mhm )) 

528.30 530.01 A: mhm 

528.48 535.34 B: that's where they can cut some of these costs regulate the the pharmaceutical companies 

531.66 532.60 A: right 

534.79 535.92 A: right 

535.64 538.54 B: put a cap on medical expenses 

537.86 539.06 A: (( exactly i- )) 

539.13 541.95 B: dental th- they're outrageous [lipsmack] 

541.02 550.12 A: i- i- it's [mn] phenomenal it's like you know h- a lotta people in my job are not having any kinda coverage there they're like it's not worth it 

550.23 555.02 A: you know you just go to the hospital if something happened and you just get billed and you pay the bill 

554.70 555.77 B: (( mhm [lipsmack] )) 

555.17 557.93 A: heh that's the whole that's the whole idea 

557.32 565.07 B: well and then well my brother too he had a his first wife ah died of leukemia when she was twenty four years old 

564.68 565.59 A: right 

565.16 568.74 B: and they were so young they didn't have health insurance 

568.34 575.57 A: (( mm mhm )) 

569.11 578.84 B: she thought she was still covered on her mother her mother and father's insurance plan because she was a fulltime student but because they married it was void 

579.08 582.91 B: and so she ended up not having any insurance at all 

582.57 588.20 A: mhm 

583.58 593.00 B: um [sigh] my brother thought they were going to be in financial ruins but if you have a cas- a catastrophic loss like that the state comes in and pays for it 

592.33 593.56 A: exactly 

593.30 599.95 B: so you know if you have smaller things you you pay along and then you know that that safety net's there
