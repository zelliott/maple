224.98 232.10 B: and i've got family all that live all different parts of the country too that send me all kinds of jokes so so they they get from other people 

232.42 236.08 A: so do you do you ever have to ah filter the jokes who you send to who 

236.15 238.98 B: yeah i do ah some people ah 

239.28 243.91 B: ah i i just can't send like th- the joke i just told you there's 

243.93 247.51 B: ah like a friend in boston i can't send it to her 

247.53 249.20 B: because ah 

250.29 253.58 B: the only internet she receives is at her workplace 

253.83 256.55 B: so i have to be careful what i send to her 

256.21 257.64 A: mhm 

257.08 265.35 B: and i have also a niece that's a a a nun i wouldn't send her that joke [laughter] especially about the priest [laughter] 

263.13 265.10 A: [laughter] 

265.39 270.42 B: so ah yeah i have dif- you know be pretty careful about what i send to who 

270.62 276.85 A: i have a um a friend who just got fired from work because um he had been sending kinda 

277.13 280.09 A: jokes and things like that around and um 

280.40 286.39 A: [cough] in the email and it was just to his friends and you know at work and they're in in their twenties and um 

286.69 287.98 A: then 

288.28 291.35 A: i think one of them tried to send it to his house 

291.44 305.10 A: and his email address [cough] he got wrong and so it went you know 'cause everybody's email address is pretty close to somebody elses and ah so the person who got it um contacted the company because you know it came out of a company email 

298.15 299.03 B: (( ahah ahah )) 

304.72 306.31 B: yeah out of their computer 

305.15 308.62 A: and and they like 'bout twenty people got fired over it 

308.02 312.32 B: oh jeeze that's that's see that's one of the reasons i can't send up 

311.23 312.96 A: yeah so be careful 

312.35 315.76 B: because my friend would get fired i wouldn't want that to happen to her 

314.06 315.03 A: yeah 

316.86 331.30 A: yeah ah they were mostly sexually explicit things that i mean there was like i think the one thing they got the biggest trouble over was they had made an m._p. three of like a rap song that had some sexually explicit comments in it i mean so from their standpoint you know this is public airway stuff you know it's no big deal 

319.91 320.47 B: (( [mn] )) 

326.90 327.90 B: mhm 

331.84 332.84 A: and ah 

331.94 334.93 B: well let's just say it's over the phone that's what it is so 

334.35 336.17 A: right 

335.64 342.76 B: yeah i mean it's supposed to be private and all that but [cough] it's not private when you're sending it into a 

339.12 339.68 A: (( [cough] )) 

342.86 344.95 B: a company's computer 

344.81 345.75 A: mhm 

344.97 347.27 B: that somebody works at that's for sure 

346.28 347.03 A: right 

348.49 353.41 A: so mo- is most of your filtering based on um like sexually explicit things or 

353.17 361.73 B: no no i get all kinds of jokes no i get it mo- well a lot of it is sexually explicit but i get all kinds of jokes on it 

354.81 355.94 A: all kinds of stuff 

363.67 368.90 B: i just i only remember the dirty ones [laughter] what can i tell you 

365.88 367.98 A: [laughter] 

369.17 370.04 B: (( [laughter] )) 

371.11 373.53 A: yeah so like i guess that i think i think ah 

373.85 380.36 A: the way i filter is i just anything that i think might offend somebody i just kinda leave it alone [laughter] just kinda keep myself outta trouble 

379.75 386.40 B: well i know i- [cough] i don't mind sending that on if i know who i'm sending it to like i say so that's not 

384.35 385.18 A: (( ahah )) 

385.54 393.50 A: yeah the only time i get stuff like that is when people i get you know going back to the other you know from the previous story where people send me things accidentally 

390.80 391.58 B: (( ahah )) 

392.85 394.33 B: yeah 

394.98 397.14 A: that's about the only time i get jokes ah 

398.27 400.95 B: so anyhow how did you get hooked up on this thing 

401.16 405.21 A: i just saw it on a ah bulletin board the other day um
