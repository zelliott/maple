18.65 21.77 A: um i don't really know what's she's talking about bad jokes 

21.99 31.34 B: the other lady it was like more like where you draw the line where humor should end we were like it's like the nine one one and stuff and then she talked about like political and stuff i think it's just about anything 

31.65 32.64 B: um 

32.30 35.32 A: like sexual jokes or just regular jokes 

35.46 40.38 B: i think it's a little bit of it all they really didn't give us too much of a a basis on it 

39.92 40.86 A: (( no all right oh )) 

40.71 44.48 B: i guess i'm a little bit more open to humor so that's too much 

43.09 51.16 A: i make jokes of uh at people's expenses a lot so i don't really know when to draw the line i just kind of keep going until they walk away 

48.31 49.12 B: [laughter] 

51.31 61.78 B: i guess i'm a little bit the same one i'm a blonde so i get a lot of stuff thrown at me and usually i'll be able to toss enough back and having an older brother where you're always like throwing jokes and comedy at one another was like 

61.75 66.36 B: i hope a pack of rats infest your armpit you know [laughter] it's like 

66.49 69.85 B: so i think i'm a little bit more uh wild than the side

72.19 74.53 B: or i'd throw back at somebody so 

74.63 84.86 A: yeah i'm not i'm not really i don't listen to a lot of people i'm just sarcastic like when people are ignorant i tend to point it out and that's the basis of my entire humor 

78.91 79.86 B: yeah 

85.08 86.07 A: so 

86.10 93.98 A: yeah i really don't quit because usually when people piss me off i try to make fun of them and it's usually funny for other people who'll sit there and watch that 

90.41 91.16 B: [laughter] 

93.64 105.54 B: oh yeah especially we're both from the south so you've get a little bit of the accent and i'm originally from up north so i put the north and the south together so it's like wait a minute everybody looks at me and they're like you talk funny and i'm like oh here we go [laughter] 

97.56 99.09 A: yeah i can tell 

103.72 110.00 A: yeah there's a bunch of people here from like illinois they go to school here and we tell that and then we make fun

150.34 151.07 B: (( see i )) 

150.46 162.37 A: i i think people get too upset when i make fun of them because people don't kn- really know how to take a joke i think people need to lighten up you brought up like nine eleven and everything i don't

160.94 161.75 B: uh-huh 

162.47 169.52 A: there's not really a line to be drawn it's just a moral thing there you kinda don't really touch it because 

166.37 167.39 B: it is 

167.68 168.69 B: (( yeah )) 

169.24 171.58 B: and everybody's touching it it's like wait a minute

172.53 175.75 A: and i haven't heard a lot of jokes about nine eleven but 

175.36 185.68 B: being down here we have 'cause i guess we're at disney so they thought it was like the big place that gets strikes so everybody was like throwing all this stuff at me and i'm looking i'm going we're not gonna get hit you know

191.78 194.45 A: yeah i know one live in winter park 

194.21 196.15 B: oh it's a nice area 

195.81 197.57 A: yeah i know they wait for it 

197.37 198.80 B: (( [laughter] )) 

199.13 210.94 B: yeah it's like wait a minute everything down here i mean i guess we're a little liberal down here too 'cause i was up in new york some of the jokes i'd make down here would never go up there i would have my head like writ- ripped off 

204.68 205.71 A: yeah 

209.72 214.15 A: there's a lot of liberal people down here i don't like 'em at all i make fun of them 

214.79 216.09 B: (( [laughter] it )) 

215.08 218.74 A: 'cause they're like bill clinton was the best president and i'm like you're ignorant 

217.62 219.98 B: (( no he wasn't [laughter] )) 

218.81 220.74 A: (( you're an ignoramus' balls )) 

220.17 227.88 B: [laughter] no he wasn't see i do a lot of political even though i don't get into it i'll make the jokes against 'em it's like these presidents suck you know 

227.46 242.14 A: yeah i hear a lot a lot of people make jokes down here like this is the b- big bible belt area and jay dubb's not very religious guy and everybody makes fun of him for it and make fun of how slow he is and you know what 

233.64 234.64 B: yeah 

240.67 241.43 B: [laughter] 

243.28 250.61 A: you guys are ignorant i don't really i i i'm kind of close minded when people try to make jokes that i don't really care for 

250.72 260.21 B: [mn] i am to a point but i guess like the south they really hit florida a lot because they figure we're like the most ignorant and we're all like beach bums and sit around all the time yeah 

257.74 259.51 A: the weiner of america 

260.27 265.21 B: so it's like oh my god and then when we had our ballots all done wrong it's like okay here we go 

265.06 267.06 A: yeah i know i used to live down there 

266.55 267.49 B: (( yeah )) 

267.59 269.54 B: i've been down here twelve years so 

269.75 273.00 B: it's long enough to really know what goes on it's like wait a minute 

272.58 273.74 A: (( intelligent )) 

273.87 279.90 B: but it's kind of interesting it's like you see all the stuff even on the computer 'cause i go on that more than anything 

279.91 280.90 A: (( right )) 

280.18 288.60 B: it's like i'll get on to like the comedy area and that and i think on the computer they put a little bit more on than what they do on t._v. 'cause i think they're a little bit more selective to who gets on it 

288.71 294.14 B: while television anybody can change a channel and run instant like the comedy warehouse or comedy central or 

293.45 294.34 A: yeah 

295.33 300.62 B: it's like we had a bunch of the places up in new york we actually had the comedy warehouse up there we have one down here 

300.82 310.01 B: in uh well actually like the two just being in two different places is completely different like you said the south is a little more uh different in their jokes than the north 

309.76 310.65 A: yeah 

310.60 311.59 B: um 

311.61 313.87 A: there's a bunch of jokes that are like 

313.89 321.50 A: we go on the internet and actually there's a bunch of like new jokes that i heard and they they're really funny although they're kind of bad 

318.03 318.70 B: yeah 

321.59 322.72 B: they are 

322.22 324.71 A: but this this one is crap 

324.60 333.04 B: well when it gets into that you know disney'll like jessica rabbit okay they write up jessica rabbit what's her big thing you show off her boobs well now disney doesn't like it 

333.35 342.43 B: because every picture they have her low slung and it's like come on you brought this character out that you knew was gonna be like all over and then you get mad about it 

342.16 344.94 A: disney's actually run into a lot of trouble in the past 

344.28 352.53 B: they are they they've crossed the line one too many times it's like even though you they use like buena vista for their get out it's so like they're in trouble 

351.77 357.85 A: um yeah the catholic church doesn't really care too much for disney right now 

357.11 358.50 B: no they don't 

358.53 368.73 B: neither does uh what's the other one is it methodist it's one of the them yeah baptist it's like they hate 'em and you talk to a lot of people down here like i worked for 'em for two and a half years i hate 'em 

360.84 362.38 A: (( the baptist church [mn] )) 

368.59 369.67 A: (( really )) 

369.12 374.00 B: yeah i hate the whole issue about disney i like going there and the parks and everything 

374.05 377.97 B: but when you get into like the politics and what they get into it's crazy 

377.75 381.10 A: yeah but i'd kill somebody to be michael osmond 

380.50 392.65 B: yeah oh god he makes so much money and he is he is rude as all get out they show him on t._v. yeah they show him on t._v. like the straight guy and it's like we all turn our back to him it's like [mn] go away 

385.80 387.60 A: yeah i'd be rude too
