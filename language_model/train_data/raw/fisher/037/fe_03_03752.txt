24.30 31.69 A: well i mean if if you're if you're working to live off of five fifteen an hour it's not gonna happen 

31.30 34.88 B: right right [laughter] exactly 

33.17 34.41 A: but uh 

34.51 38.91 A: you know even two people working at five fifteen an hour is not gonna pay 

39.19 42.22 A: rent and utilities and food and 

41.64 43.73 B: still can't make it 

42.45 44.89 A: [noise] no no way 

44.45 56.36 B: no it's not enough i i i agree with that especially for uh single moms that didn't get to finish their education they have to settle for minimum wage you know 

46.17 47.39 A: it isn't [noise] 

54.87 56.18 A: mhm 

56.36 64.26 B: just think of what they have to go through with no education and they have to live off of it with a baby or so you know i 

63.36 64.58 A: yeah 

64.51 67.81 B: it's hard yeah it's hard 

65.41 79.43 A: there is no way and then you know people get on on people for being on welfare and food stamps it's like well if you'd pay more for a minimum wage you wouldn't have to pay for that it's either pay for it for minimum wage and let 'em work 

73.80 75.96 B: right right 

79.43 81.54 A: or pay for it the other way 

81.18 95.39 B: right right you're right about that and um i you know i don't knock anybody that who have to get the welfare because of the minimum wage being the because groceries are high by theirselves 

88.62 90.06 A: (( you know [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

90.64 92.65 A: [noise] exactly 

93.37 94.58 A: [noise] 

94.95 101.42 A: oh man i know [noise] oh i took you know i took wick and there's 

95.97 97.84 B: [laughter] 

100.93 102.94 B: right 

101.87 106.91 A: you know i had to have that when my um my kids are still little but 

106.30 111.12 B: yeah formula was oh formula i don't even wanna get into that 

108.36 109.26 A: (( [mn] )) 

110.10 114.75 A: yeah if you had to buy diapers and formula on five fifteen an hour 

114.36 115.67 B: mhm 

115.76 116.95 B: yeah 

115.98 121.41 A: [mn] and most minimum wage jobs won't ho- won't um they won't hire people full time 

121.03 123.34 B: yeah y- i know that uh 

123.71 128.24 A: so then you know not only are they making five fifteen an hour they're not getting 

128.26 134.21 A: more than you know if they give you more than twenty hours they have to pay benefits so they're not gonna do that 

131.88 133.16 B: right 

133.76 135.79 B: so they'd rather just uh 

135.91 140.11 B: give you the minimum wage and just let you just try to make it off of that huh 

139.63 147.50 A: yeah so then you have no benefits and you're only getting twenty hours a week and you're only getting five fifteen an hour there's [noise] [noise] 

140.30 142.02 B: yeah 

144.11 145.44 B: right 

146.40 153.33 B: yeah and that's why i just really i i have i myself i experienced this this is way i had to go back to school 

153.23 167.54 B: and you know i made a mistake when i was younger i got pregnant had a kid and got out there and thought i could make it on that and you know and i had to go back to school in order to to survive you know and i try to tell my kids now you know it's education 

163.36 164.93 A: oh yeah 

167.20 168.64 A: mhm 

167.73 176.16 B: that's the key you know without that you won't make it in this world you will have to go get some welfare or some stamp or something you know 

175.37 176.48 A: something 

176.50 178.11 B: i mean it's 

177.37 187.43 A: well and it's not even you know even people there are some people that can't get an education i teach and i see kids that you know they work as hard as they can 

182.64 184.15 B: right right 

186.73 188.06 B: right 

187.46 197.33 A: and that's all they can do and they're just not they're not gonna make it at college they're just not it's they they work their little butts off and they get a c. 

188.82 190.08 B: that's right 

192.21 194.44 B: right right 

197.30 209.64 A: or a d. and that's all they can do and it's not 'cause they're lazy it's just you know they're just that's not where they're shine you know everybody's got something that they're good at and 

198.35 199.48 B: (( right mhm )) 

207.05 208.14 B: right 

209.68 215.77 A: and reading writing and maths is just not what they're good at and they're gonna have to take 

215.79 225.55 A: a minimum wage job because they're not gonna be able to make it in college they don't have the skills to make it in college and then you know we're kinda condemning them to be 

219.04 220.40 B: right 

226.03 232.72 A: in poverty just cause they're not as bright as somebody else which i don't think is right either you know

231.76 233.74 B: yeah you're right you're right 

233.77 242.72 B: um and then with the economy today and oh so many people being laid off that people just have to take what they can take to in order to survive you know
