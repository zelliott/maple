373.74 374.60 B: uh 

374.64 382.96 B: i guess it's okay if it's like a girl talking to other girls or a guy talking to other guys but people can gross each other terribly out with that 

382.85 385.43 A: yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah 

384.86 391.90 B: like if you're the only guy and there's a bunch of girls sitting around talking about menstrual periods or something like that that's not cool

403.92 404.87 B: yeah 

404.37 409.27 A: if you just in that environment where you're working with a bunch of women and they joking about it 

409.50 414.71 A: you just really just need to i don't know what you can do just walk off 

414.78 416.73 A: and then they call you anti social 

416.82 419.10 B: hey uh shaun are you black 

418.90 419.98 A: yep 

419.88 424.30 B: you don't like to hear like jokes about that right that's very offensive to you 

425.83 428.87 B: un- unless it's a black person making the jokes right 

427.10 428.10 A: (( [noise] )) 

429.52 431.99 A: well i'm my tolerance is pretty high 

431.85 435.69 B: well it upsets me to hear that i have a lot of black cousins 

436.06 444.82 B: so it just fires me up to hear some redneck you know saying the n. word and making some you know tacky joke and i'll tell him about it 

441.01 441.96 A: yeah 

444.99 456.41 B: and you know 'cause that's totally not cool you know if you're a member of a group like the females talking about pregnancy or or black people dissing each other that's one thing 

456.54 463.53 B: but if you're an outsider to that group and you come in and you're trying to be all smart and everything that's offensive i think 

461.12 462.27 A: (( [noise] )) 

466.82 467.94 B: (( i don't know )) 

468.04 477.83 B: um we have some racist rednecks up here you know who who don't have they have that drunk sense of humor like oh ha ha you know i'm gonna put somebody down to make me 

478.28 482.18 B: feel better about myself and and that offends me 

482.76 486.86 A: yeah have you heard any um um good good humor 

483.68 484.55 B: (( you know )) 

486.96 489.58 B: have i heard any good humor 

488.34 488.92 A: (( [noise] )) 

489.18 490.14 A: yeah 

489.87 495.76 B: this is terrible um i've got a friend in new york who sends me blonde jokes all the time 

495.65 500.08 A: yeah uh i just laugh at those sometimes i just laugh 

497.43 498.88 B: yeah 

500.24 506.66 B: see my mom's blond and stuff but she can still laugh like hell when she hears a good blonde joke you know 

505.95 509.38 A: yeah i'm as i say it all depends on the to- on uh tolerance 

509.78 510.78 B: (( ah )) 

511.35 516.78 B: okay this is sorta tacky and awful but i'll tell you anyway what kind of meat do priests eat 

519.19 520.13 A: (( i don't )) 

519.58 520.64 B: none 

520.85 521.46 A: (( know )) 

525.61 526.85 A: (( [noise] ah )) 

526.88 529.13 B: but they don't make it a habit

533.46 534.49 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

533.84 534.82 B: (( ah )) 

535.20 538.70 B: then again that's what we used to tell each other in the army a lot 

540.78 552.73 B: like it goes back to where you're part of a group of people you know like everybody in the army you can tell these bad jokes to everybody else you know to each other but you don't tell them to an outsider or they're gonna think it's offensive 

548.03 549.20 A: (( mhm ))
