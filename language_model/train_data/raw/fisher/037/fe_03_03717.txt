12.56 17.23 B: [noise] i'm doing well to tell you the truth i heard 

17.37 23.00 B: a wage increase from five fifteen an hour but i didn't hear what the exact topic was did you hear it 

22.43 28.84 A: [mn] the do we think that is a fair top- do we think that is a fair amount 

26.26 27.35 B: [noise] 

29.16 30.65 A: for minimum wage 

29.98 32.70 B: [noise] [noise] [lipsmack] what do you think [noise]

32.81 33.77 B: (( [noise] )) 

34.31 42.11 B: [noise] i think it has to be the t- i think it should be a state matter honestly because i live in new york state and 

42.05 57.05 B: five fifteen an hour is not enough money for it's not a living wage i'm saying you cannot find an apartment or and be able to eat on five fifteen an hour so i think and there are some states where the cost of living is r- is significantly lower than that 

57.18 64.21 B: so in my humble opinion i think it should be a state decision instead of just a standard i mean just you know what i 

61.60 62.44 A: (( we- )) 

63.16 68.66 A: yeah i do i live in arizona but i came from california 

64.32 65.18 B: (( mean [noise] ))

74.27 77.60 A: california it's six seventy five a hour 

77.85 79.28 B: how much 

78.65 80.10 A: six seventy five 

80.10 88.73 B: six seventy five wow do you think the cost of living has has change drama- i mean is it lower or cheaper lower or higher in arizona 

81.36 82.97 A: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

88.24 95.74 A: [cough] it's cheaper in arizona but [sigh] you still it's still hard to pay for anything 

95.66 97.19 B: mhm 

96.54 101.57 A: um and [sigh] i mean it's hard to 

102.78 105.06 A: [noise] to make ends meet 

104.96 110.56 B: [noise] no i completely agree with you well then i just had a new thought 

106.31 107.56 A: you know 

110.54 114.46 B: i guess five fifteen an hour would be appropriate for 

114.37 125.81 B: students you know the sixteen year olds and the fifteen year olds who are trying to get a little after school job to save up to buy a car or a couple of c._d.s on their own you know to have a little spending money on the side 

115.66 116.68 A: yeah 

125.02 127.44 A: [mn] yes that's true 

125.95 126.73 B: so 

127.66 136.23 B: so maybe it should be age dependent also like to when you get when you get to a certain age five fifteen just won't cut it [laughter] 

129.89 131.28 A: that's true 

134.84 138.23 A: yeah i mean if that's like for a single mother 

138.37 139.55 B: oh no 

138.51 142.89 A: kinda ways a couple of children or even one child 

142.10 144.03 B: yeah impossible 

143.22 148.41 A: that's not getting no child support or state aid or anything 

148.11 149.52 B: mhm 

148.94 151.01 A: you know that's not enough 

151.28 153.42 B: (( no it's definitely not )) 

151.62 155.68 A: um i know my mother raised the two of us 

155.25 156.71 B: (( [noise] )) 

155.97 158.86 A: by herself on minimum wage 

158.65 159.87 B: mhm 

159.31 162.95 A: when my neighbor lived downstairs 

163.16 167.00 A: lived on welfare made more money on welfare 

168.06 169.94 A: and had medical

170.62 172.68 A: and food stamps made

178.36 180.07 A: with no medical 

180.09 180.77 B: (( sh )) 

180.80 182.64 A: and that's not fair 

182.43 185.54 B: (( no i agree if she it's definitely not fair )) 

183.65 193.26 A: you know so i'm looking at things like that um so you know i think it should go by you know maybe age 

188.71 190.09 B: (( i agree )) 

193.43 197.13 A: and and how hard of a worker somebody is 

196.99 198.74 B: yeah definitely 

197.84 199.04 A: (( oh )) 

199.10 202.81 A: you know my mother never worked a day in her life until the divorce 

202.82 203.95 B: yeah 

203.74 209.69 A: um and i mean she started out working fast food at the bottom of the chain 

209.52 210.54 B: yeah 

210.05 212.28 A: and worked her way up to manager 

212.27 213.47 B: mhm 

213.06 216.88 A: you know within what two and a half 

214.88 215.74 B: (( [noise] )) 

216.80 217.93 B: yeah 

217.67 220.13 A: and so she started out 

220.26 228.67 A: when she started working i think she started out making it's hard to remember it seems like she started out making four seventy five a hour 

228.70 229.73 B: (( yes )) 

229.48 235.98 A: when she quit there to go to another company she was making eleven dollars a hour 

233.46 234.45 B: mhm 

236.01 236.77 B: (( mm )) 

237.00 241.79 A: but you know i mean she had to work hard to make that 

241.42 242.43 B: mhm 

242.42 250.77 B: and and now that i think about it another thing that you have to consider when when [mn] federal when the federal government's gonna consi- considering raising the minimum wage is that 

250.56 259.48 B: i don't remember see i don't know if you remember when bill clinton raise the minimum wage from four twenty five to i think well from four seven to five fifteen 

253.44 256.37 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

259.30 260.27 A: uh-huh 

259.66 262.37 B: what happened to a lot of small businesses is that 

262.20 268.96 B: them having to suddenly be forced to raise their employees rate by like i think a dollar and ninety cents 

268.77 279.64 B: they they forced them to lay off i think when you come across a company that that cannot afford to do it immediately i think maybe that company should take on like i guess a gradual increase you 

270.68 272.05 A: [lipsmack] that's right 

279.53 282.70 A: uh and you know who needs to take a lotta cuts 

279.83 280.88 B: (( know what i mean mm )) 

283.13 284.95 A: are like the government 

284.90 285.94 B: (( [laughter] )) 

285.93 291.64 A: um the people who work for the government and the white houses 

286.50 287.52 B: [laughter] 

291.62 292.99 B: [laughter] 

292.23 294.76 A: they need to take big cuts 

295.02 296.14 B: (( [laughter] )) 

295.63 299.00 A: they make all the big money the congressmen 

298.91 304.67 B: yeah somewhere in i think in the sixth in the six figure region is that right mm [mn] 

302.42 311.97 A: mm that that's it you know they are the ones with the big money and it's just like the schoolteachers don't get paid big money 

312.13 315.21 A: but the school districts do 

315.22 316.74 B: yeah 

315.40 315.97 A: (( [noise] )) 

316.34 322.16 A: the v._i._p.s make the big money to sit in these big plush offices 

318.82 319.98 B: yeah 

322.17 326.29 A: that don't have to put up with the kids or teach the kids 

322.57 323.14 B: (( [laughter] )) 

326.73 330.49 A: but schoolteachers don't make good money 

330.38 331.41 B: yeah 

331.29 334.65 A: um you know and that's not fair 

334.93 336.81 B: (( no that's sure going on hm )) 

335.36 341.50 A: the v._i._p.s the v._i._p.s shouldn't be making that kind of money the money should be going to the schoolteachers 

342.53 343.93 A: and 

342.66 350.68 B: [sigh] i completely agree with you um like a system where [sigh] the amount of money you make is dependent on 

350.73 359.37 B: how much goodness or how much positive influence y- your your [mn] that you've [mn] that you're influencing upon the world and society at large 

358.84 360.47 A: right 

359.61 368.75 B: [laughter] [laughter] a- and in my humble opinion i think teachers are far more viable in the long run than a v._i._p. or a c._e._o. 

361.09 362.25 A: right 

367.23 369.03 A: that's right 

369.15 373.52 A: the teachers are the one i mean i'm going to school to be a teacher so

376.25 377.37 B: okay

381.77 382.91 B: (( oh okay [noise] )) 

382.20 385.39 A: but teachers don't make the money 

386.35 388.73 A: that the v._i._p.s do 

388.74 390.64 B: yes i agree you 

390.29 393.02 A: so you have to 

390.75 391.64 B: don't make 

394.66 397.91 A: you know the v._i._p.s shouldn't be making that kinda money 

398.71 405.81 A: and i do know the v._i._p.s have the plush offices with the nice desk and the nice comfortable chairs 

403.60 404.73 B: (( [laughter] [sigh] yeah )) 

406.27 408.57 A: just like our congressmen do 

408.70 411.94 B: exactly do you remember your first job 

412.80 415.34 A: um my first job was working for carl's 

416.17 417.56 B: was working for what 

416.28 418.86 A: working under my mother [laughter] 

418.23 420.99 B: oh was it minimum wage at the time 

420.45 422.07 A: yes it was 

421.68 432.90 B: oh i remember my first job was um telemarketing actually in college and i i actually made about a dollar more than the 'cause uh the minimum wage at the time because 

432.92 441.94 B: um it was an on campus job and it was it was a job that was more it was more a part of the alumni association on campus 

441.44 442.39 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

441.76 453.70 B: and our and our and the school i went to was georgia tech which happens has very prestigious alumni one of which is the former president jimmy carter so our alumni gave a lot of money to our school a- and that and that's one reason why 

453.99 459.85 B: i i mean i never made the exact minimum wage i usually was able to find a job that made a little bit more than that 

458.93 460.32 A: (( [laughter] uh-huh )) 

460.23 463.96 B: w- usually i usually was a little pickier in my in my job search
