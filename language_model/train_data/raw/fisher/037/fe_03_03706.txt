1.04 2.29 B: hello 

1.86 5.14 A: yes hi [laughter] this is cherie burns 

4.99 7.02 B: hi my name's monique 

7.09 8.17 A: hi monique 

8.53 9.85 B: (( um )) 

9.95 12.80 B: [lipsmack] ah where are you from [laughter] 

11.87 17.61 A: okay all right i live in ohio in about halfway between ah cleveland and pittsburg 

17.78 20.01 B: (( okay i live in san francisco [lipsmack] )) 

20.82 24.20 B: (( [noise] so um minimum wage i guess is our topic )) 

24.22 25.61 A: yes mhm 

25.43 28.13 B: (( um what are your thoughts on that [mn] )) 

28.51 29.99 A: (( i'm sorry i didn't quite hear that )) 

29.75 31.69 B: oh what were your thoughts on that 

31.95 37.83 A: all right ah well five fifteen it depends i feel like minimum wage maybe for a high school 

38.08 39.56 A: (( person [laughter] you know )) 

39.35 41.22 B: exactly yeah i agree 

41.52 42.39 A: pardon 

41.62 44.61 B: [mn] i definitely agree with that 

43.62 52.01 A: okay yeah that might be good for them but like for for somebody to raise a family on or be married or even try to live on their own five fifteen definitely is not enough 

51.78 61.48 B: mhm and i als- also feel it there should almost be a regional difference i just moved to san francisco and i'm so amazed at how expensive it is compared to any other city i've ever lived in and 

60.63 65.20 A: oh ah usually ah east coast and west coast are a little bit more higher than 

64.98 68.27 B: yeah yeah i came from the midwest actually so 

65.42 66.52 A: many parts of 

67.59 68.69 A: oh i see 

68.64 78.77 B: and just you know things like rent are so much cheaper there and then i come out here and the minimum wage stays the same but yet everything else living expenses are a lot higher so that's what you know 

79.38 82.76 B: [sigh] i think that's something that should almost be taken into account as well 

82.28 83.52 A: yeah that's true 

83.71 97.39 A: yeah and you're right yeah i know ah [lipsmack] oh a couple of years ago i was in florida and there were signs in um like mcdonalds seven dollars an hour eight dollars an hour which is you know minimum wage at that time was probably like i don't know four fifty or something like that so 

97.74 100.19 A: it really depends on the part of the country you're in 

101.00 108.92 B: mhm yeah i guess some i guess some businesses probably regulate it regardless of what minimum wage is you know through the economy of that region 

101.58 102.47 A: yeah 

108.96 113.24 B: 'cause if it's that expensive you know they're not going to find someone to work for that low 

113.02 114.05 A: that's true 

114.65 122.00 A: although i i mean in the past i've owned my own business and when i had to pay somebody you know have you know i usually start 'em at least minimum wage or sometimes more 

122.28 127.10 A: it depends on the size of the business for a small business sometimes that's a big chunk of money but 

128.00 136.53 A: [mn] but like my partner always says if you pay peanuts you're going to get monkeys so if you pay [laughter] you know if you pay the lowest wage you're not going to get very qualified people 

132.69 133.62 B: [laughter] 

136.42 139.08 B: right exactly exactly 

138.21 140.67 A: but um maybe the minimum wage should be 

140.86 143.33 A: the absolute rock bottom basic 

143.63 145.98 A: rate for somebody who 

146.46 155.27 A: is just doing the most menial job you know like maybe flipping burgers at mcdonalds and that's why i'm thinking a high school person or teenager who lives with their mother or 

150.75 152.32 B: mhm right 

155.34 157.91 A: you know that's not too bad but 

155.39 156.23 B: mhm 

157.23 162.09 B: yeah it would also i think be a good incentive for you know people to get a higher education is you know 

162.06 175.80 B: for each degree that you hold whether it be high school or a bachelors or masters that that your minimum wage category be higher you know 'cause you spend so much money on schooling and education you think that you get out of you know high school and you should be able to 

175.78 183.58 B: you know get a certain minimum wage but let's say you were gonna you graduate from college and you know you're just or you're you're actually a student your minimum wage should actually go up you know 

183.45 184.28 A: true 

184.07 192.75 B: [mn] 'cause i'm actually in that cory- category i'm i'm currently going to graduate school i'm not getting minimum wage but at the same time i don't think i'm getting money for what i'm qualified for 

192.98 196.78 B: [lipsmack] but you know i'm still looking for the right job so that's 

197.12 202.51 B: a whole 'nother category 'cause san francisco's no one's hiring here for anything [laughter] 

201.64 205.32 A: oh right yeah well that's you know the problem all over the country actually but 

205.45 206.39 B: yeah 

205.50 213.69 A: and with and with things so bad i guess that five fifteen an hour that starts to look pretty good but still you know you can't do much with five fifteen [laughter] you know 

212.93 214.09 B: no 

213.89 223.18 A: like i i'm like you i mean i have advanced education but there are other people out there who do have degrees but still they're not qualified to do anything so [mn] 

222.65 223.90 B: (( right right and to )) 

223.86 234.15 A: [laughter] so it's tough to say yeah i think it's all relative and but maybe it's it's good as at least a starting point and benchmark for a company that they know they have to start at least there 

234.17 239.18 B: be honest i for some reason i thought it was actually higher than five fifteen but i guess it's not i 

234.30 235.17 A: (( you know )) 

238.16 242.17 A: yeah i did too yeah i was kind of surprised to hear that it's been a while since [lipsmack] 

241.17 242.71 B: (( thought it was five seventy five )) 

242.82 243.76 A: oh really 

244.08 245.28 A: (( yeah go )) 

244.09 245.69 B: (( but then i guess )) 

245.93 246.68 A: ahead 

246.91 249.11 B: [mn] unless they're just doing that to throw a 

249.21 250.36 B: (( throw a [laughter] )) 

250.56 255.45 A: ah if yeah it's been a while since we had anybody work for us that we had to worry about that sort of thing 

255.91 259.07 A: but like i said we're a small company people don't realize 

259.14 262.51 A: you know what a big chunk of money it is to pay somebody 

262.73 273.80 A: and then sometimes too once you have people who are working at minimum wage and they think well this is only a crappy minimum wage job so they don't put forward the full effort either you know [laughter] so it's it's all 

271.52 272.43 B: right 

273.94 276.80 A: [mn] depends on what perspective you're coming from or 

277.13 279.22 A: you know what your background or what your 

279.34 281.23 A: ethics are too i guess 

281.06 288.17 B: yeah [mn] i mean i guess in some ways it is good that it's standardized though at least so that people are at least getting what 

288.28 291.92 B: a minimum but it always does seem a little bit lower than it should be 

293.33 298.57 B: [mn] and then there's still people that are working for under minimum wage you know just illegally and they're 

298.01 298.79 A: true 

298.79 299.89 B: (( as well )) 

299.76 305.77 A: yeah and plus and like i said for a company i mean not only are they paying you the minimum wage but they're paying your 

305.83 312.95 A: half of your social security and and usually probably not too many benefits but there might occasionally be some benefits too on top of that so 

308.93 310.04 B: (( [mn] )) 

312.20 313.16 B: [noise] 

313.44 317.95 A: it's like probably one and a half times that at least you know what they're paying out 

316.32 323.94 B: [noise] right yeah that's true as well yeah and so much of your pay check ends up you know going away from you anyway [laughter] 

323.44 325.44 A: (( right that's true yeah )) 

325.61 326.54 B: (( so )) 

326.44 329.25 A: a good twenty five thirty percent depends on your 

329.33 330.99 A: tax bracket but 

329.51 331.78 B: (( right tax bracket )) 

332.03 335.95 B: (( i guess if you're receiving minimum wage it's not going to be that high but still you know )) 

336.85 342.13 A: yeah but like i said i i feel for like a young person you know that's not a bad wage 

342.42 343.35 B: mhm 

342.70 347.60 A: but even then i don't know if i'd work for five dollars an hour [laughter] or five fifteen or whatever 

346.64 357.10 B: now in high school when you're new to the job and you know that's pretty much i think in a lot of ways the only thing people are going to pay you the only job you're going to be getting is entry entry entry level you know and 

356.23 357.48 A: right 

357.36 367.15 B: just when you get in college and you're looking for a job at least you have had another job before and you know i think in some ways and in high school you're pretty much being supported anyway so i 

366.55 367.36 A: true 

367.94 371.58 B: (( figure minimum wage for that but yeah i think it should go up after that as well )) 

372.14 373.33 A: (( right [mn] but )) 

373.96 374.97 B: (( [mn] [mn] so no )) 

374.66 378.63 A: but i think your point about the region of the country is true because ah 

379.19 381.68 A: that's one of the businesses i've been in is 

381.82 384.92 A: placing people in different parts of the country and if you go from 

384.94 391.06 A: like ohio or indiana to east coast or west coast like you know fifty thousand dollars doesn't buy the same 

391.16 393.16 A: house like you said or 

392.18 394.25 B: no [noise] oh 

394.06 397.07 A: or or myself in this area a lot of people live in 

397.31 400.28 A: here but work in pittsburg because they can get a 

400.41 406.71 A: better house like a they can get a house here for a hundred and fifty thousand that would cost them three hundred thousand over there 

406.88 408.17 B: (( yeah )) 

407.14 411.54 A: so you're right it's regional and all relative 

411.39 412.46 B: right 

412.50 414.89 A: but yeah five fifteen in 

415.21 420.12 A: new york city doesn't buy the same as five fifteen in indiana i'm sure [laughter] 

416.76 417.78 B: [noise] 

419.49 424.47 B: (( [noise] exactly [noise] in new york city you probably couldn't go very far at all with that little money [laughter] )) 

423.66 426.23 A: probably one cup of coffee or something like that 

425.64 429.81 B: yeah i paid three dollars for a cup of coffee [laughter] 

427.89 428.97 A: (( oh really oh no [laughter] )) 

430.28 431.47 B: (( [mn] but )) 

431.47 440.49 A: but yes i know i'm i know there's a lot of ah i see sometimes when i go to work a lot of homeless people and they're in shelters where they are 

431.69 432.51 B: (( yup )) 

440.84 451.81 A: you know they can stay a night but they ha- they make 'em leave at daytime and i think you know it's a shame that they can't even go at least work for a minimum wage job somewhere you know they could still be a productive member of society 

451.81 452.81 B: mhm 

452.14 455.57 A: and i bet they'd be happy to get the minimum wage it'd be something 

454.53 455.61 B: right 

455.70 457.14 B: yeah 

456.41 461.24 A: make 'em feel better about themselves instead of just you know taking welfare checks 

461.42 465.00 B: (( mhm yeah 'cause there's a lot of that going on here as well )) 

466.05 472.40 A: yeah that's what i heard in the state of california in well l- l._a. i heard this on um bill o'reilly the other day that 

472.34 482.96 A: there's five hundred students i think it was a month are coming into the l._a. school system and they're mostly children of illegal aliens and obviously illegal aliens themselves but 

483.60 484.95 B: yeah right 

485.01 493.76 A: so their parents are probably you know they'd be grateful to get the minimum wage 'cause they come from absolutely nothing in mexico where they didn't make much and 

493.27 494.59 B: mhm 

495.83 496.76 A: (( but i don't )) 

496.43 497.54 B: (( [sigh] [lipsmack] )) 

496.92 504.17 A: know maybe there should be a tiered system like um you know based on your age like i said if you're a teenager like with i don't know fifteen to 

502.30 503.52 B: yeah right yup 

504.20 508.65 A: eighteen you have to make at least five fifteen but an adult you know 

509.02 516.77 A: eighteen to twenty five should make seven dollars an hour or whatever i don't know if that'd be po- then that'd be considered discrimination maybe i don't know but 

516.63 527.25 B: yeah but i mean there's so much discrimination there already occurs between like if you're under eighteen or over eighteen you know you're an adult then and there's so many other things that apply you know you might as well if you have to take on all those responsibilities when you turn eighteen 

527.21 536.13 B: you know you're going to need to be able to support yourself and maybe others at that age instead of being supported by a guardian below the age of eighteen you know 

535.98 537.36 A: right plus yeah 

536.65 538.51 B: i think it's really justified 

539.02 541.37 A: yeah that's true 'cause if you're eighteen then 

541.47 547.26 A: you're ah old enough to drink and you're also old enough to be drafted you know go fight in a [laughter] war but 

547.37 551.45 A: but you're not maybe old enough to get some other ah benefits out of life 

551.38 552.83 B: (( yeah yeah so )) 

554.74 555.91 B: [mn] [sigh] hm 

555.84 557.40 A: i'm trying to think of any other 

557.27 558.80 B: [laughter] 

557.60 561.18 A: concepts here on ah minimum wage that i can come up with but 

560.54 561.67 B: [laughter] 

561.29 574.55 A: i i know myself obviously when i was a teenager in high school i worked for minimum wages in a variety of jobs in nineteen sixty four or something when i first started working i think i was making a dollar an hour and i thought i was ri- rich you know [laughter] 

574.32 575.38 B: uh-huh 

574.42 581.17 A: i had like twenty dollars at the end of the week part time job after school and i worked in a hospital and then i got a 

575.40 576.31 B: [laughter] 

581.34 587.00 A: full time job at eighteen and worked for general motors making three dollars an hour and that seemed like a lot of money but of 

586.96 589.80 B: [laughter] wow [mn] 

589.30 593.79 A: course if somebody paid me five dollars an hour then i would've really thought i was wealthy but you know [laughter] 

593.52 599.89 B: (( there you go ah yeah i been i didn't really have the minimum i i worked for my like just did like ))
