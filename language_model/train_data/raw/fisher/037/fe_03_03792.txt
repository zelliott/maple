15.12 16.43 B: yeah 

16.34 18.28 A: um how do you f- 

16.94 21.67 B: so we're supposed to discuss where we draw the line in terms of acceptable 

21.46 24.72 A: [noise] comedy yeah [noise] that's a hard one 

22.08 27.38 B: comedy do they mean in terms of what we watch on t._v. probably or 

26.82 35.80 A: um probably or personal as well i have a small son so it's it's a pretty thin line [laughter] it's 

27.97 29.13 B: yeah 

32.10 33.28 B: i do too 

34.39 35.51 B: yeah 

36.24 38.95 A: i don't care much for anything that's gonna 

39.12 43.60 A: offend my son i don't want him coming home with bad words and that so

42.79 44.42 B: right how old is he 

44.16 50.39 A: he's he's only five months now but i'm stil to the point where i think he can absorb it now 

45.89 46.99 B: okay 

49.74 53.39 B: oh they absorb everything i think i have a six year old and a two year old 

53.32 54.45 A: oh you're busy 

53.54 63.43 B: so [laughter] yeah [laughter] so we're very careful also about what is on the t._v. when when they're up and and in the room um 

62.43 63.44 A: (( yeah )) 

63.81 71.22 B: pretty much p._b._s. or you know nickelodeon something age appropriate for them and even sometimes then some of those shows 

71.22 72.43 A: yeah 

71.82 77.98 B: i find the humor is a l- is a little um beyond what they can comprehend 

77.49 79.12 A: yeah we we 

78.14 79.87 B: or encourages 

80.05 88.88 B: you know bad words not so much swear words but like calling someone a butt head or some- i mean that you know stuff like yeah mean words that's a good way to put it 

84.92 86.81 A: yeah mean words 

88.50 89.28 A: [laughter] 

89.77 94.61 A: yeah we pretty much keep it on the cartoon network but even then some of them are 

94.94 98.17 A: i didn't realize how violent they were and how 

97.39 98.64 B: yeah 

98.51 101.50 A: not really funny it is [laughter] so in that 

99.91 101.22 B: no 

101.62 103.44 A: you know um 

102.50 103.48 B: (( no )) 

103.60 106.22 B: i think as you get older you're humor changes too 

106.02 108.50 A: yeah i i agree with that 

106.63 111.57 B: what you thought was funny when you were younger is not necessarily humorous when you're older 

111.68 123.50 B: and it needs to apply also to your situation i think like we like to watch everybody loves raymond because we're married with little kids and it it applies and we find humor in that commonality 

117.58 119.34 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

125.51 126.43 A: yeah i 

126.52 127.34 A: (( we don't ))

134.41 135.56 B: (( know no mm )) 

135.49 142.73 A: really want to watch it around the baby he doesn't want him to absorb that black humor i guess it is 

140.10 140.85 B: (( hm ))

157.21 158.22 A: (( [cough] um )) 

158.93 173.19 A: we we don't watch we watch basically just the cartoons and then we watch american idol at night just to hear 'em singing but we don't really watch the sit coms and that any more just bec- i mean you know with the the bad language it's really 

164.32 165.38 B: mhm 

166.05 167.10 B: mhm 

168.89 169.79 B: (( mm )) 

173.60 181.54 A: it's pretty bad ye- you know even on regular network television there's things i wouldn't want to hear myself much less

193.94 195.33 A: know even that's not 

196.14 204.09 A: [noise] it's i don't know it there's nothing funny about it to me the vulgarity and the and the rudeness and the like you know 

204.49 206.91 A: (( i don't think it used to be like that so )) 

206.75 208.01 B: no i don't

208.47 218.72 B: no it's not you that changed well i mean you did change too probably as we all do but you're right i think that trends in television have changed a lot in terms of what's acceptable to show 

219.52 220.56 B: on t._v. 

220.48 222.53 A: yeah i think it's getting 

223.32 226.55 A: getting a lot worse honestly [laughter] 

224.13 225.27 B: (( it is it )) 

225.63 229.89 B: is things that are on at eight o'clock now you you never would have seen 

230.14 235.06 B: years ago on t._v. yeah even things that are supposed to be family shows 

231.13 232.09 A: yeah 

235.01 236.22 A: yeah we 

236.26 242.93 A: come over to my mother's house and she watches um you know she enjoys like i'm trying to think of the name of it 

243.34 244.43 A: oh 

244.79 258.63 A: everwood i think is it is and some of those other late night things and like watching them like i can't believe they let 'em say those things and you know eight o'clock at night on national television and it's just not 

246.47 247.32 B: (( mm )) 

252.42 253.58 B: mhm 

256.01 256.83 B: right 

258.63 260.46 A: funny any more [laughter]

269.08 270.39 B: yeah 

271.60 272.67 B: okay 

272.60 274.63 A: [laughter] but 

273.26 278.69 B: yeah some of those older sit coms like i love lucy and things those are those we still find funny 

279.79 284.04 A: it'd be nice to be able to watch them in the evenings but 

281.89 282.72 B: (( yes )) 

284.16 286.76 A: well we don't do the friends or the 

286.06 286.75 B: no 

286.86 287.89 A: (( so )) 

289.98 292.61 B: mhm and even the dramas have gotten 

292.93 295.27 B: kind of over the top too in terms of 

294.43 296.07 A: (( yeah )) 

295.28 297.08 B: what's acceptable to show 

298.32 303.00 A: we just never did much care for those i don't know 

302.72 303.65 B: (( mm )) 

304.74 308.59 A: i think it's getting bad on the radio too though where we are 

308.06 309.13 B: mhm 

308.71 312.84 A: like we're in cincinnati and it it's just not i mean 

313.62 322.00 A: they'll let 'em say anything pretty much you know and they have family stations certain stations you know the only time you can listen to 

315.55 316.33 B: yeah 

324.34 328.37 A: [noise] any time you can listen to certain things and and then you got to listen to the d._j.s 

328.46 330.48 A: and their vulgarity and 

329.73 330.53 B: right 

330.55 332.64 A: not really funny [laughter] 

332.27 333.18 B: no 

333.30 336.42 A: so it's not just t._v. i guess 

335.62 343.43 B: yeah t._v. and radio and and e- even just people out and about that are doing things that they think are funny that 

344.19 357.54 B: [sigh] i guess wouldn't used to be socially acceptable i don't know i live in sandusky so we get a lot of um interesting tourists [laughter] who um you know don't always act in their best judgement and 

347.27 348.99 A: yeah 

356.94 358.42 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

357.44 366.23 B: [laughter] and um that's kinda hard to explain sometimes to little ones too you know why is that person doing that and why did they think that's funny and um 

361.96 364.00 A: yeah [noise] [noise] 

365.73 366.73 A: (( [noise] ))

468.23 469.35 B: yeah 

469.73 472.14 B: oh it's so fun though when they're that tiny 

471.95 477.26 A: oh yeah we have a ball he's taking a nap now thank god i wouldn't be able [laughter] to talk on the phone 

474.45 475.30 B: (( yeah )) 

476.67 477.99 B: [laughter] 

478.40 480.88 B: oh my two year old's doing the same thing 

481.62 482.65 B: (( ooh )) 

482.72 492.83 B: it's a good time of day my favorite time of day [laughter] naptime yeah oh how fun is it a little boy you have or oh 

484.53 485.48 A: yeah 

486.19 488.03 A: absolutely 

492.12 493.78 A: yes a little boy 

494.30 496.02 A: he's my first born 

495.79 496.96 B: yeah 

497.77 503.01 B: also i had a boy first too and then we have a little girl who's four years younger and 

502.40 503.50 A: (( so ooh )) 

503.30 505.26 B: idolizes her big brother 

504.73 506.76 A: how's that 

505.93 506.99 B: yeah 

507.17 520.22 B: which is fun to watch so i find humor in them most of the time the things that they do and say i guess is where we laugh the most is when we're just hanging out as a family and silly things that happen and 

512.07 513.41 A: yeah 

520.33 521.53 A: (( ooh well )) 

520.80 526.90 B: that's where most of our humor comes from i think just every day stuff amongst ourselves pretty much i mean 

527.57 530.14 A: see i can't wait for that [laughter] 

528.92 530.04 B: yeah 

530.19 533.94 A: to start playing with him and 

532.34 540.77 B: yeah it starts young too you wouldn't think that they would get jokes as early as they do but my oldest one was telling knock knock jokes when he was two 

540.91 544.75 B: and he would just crack people up with his knock [laughter] knock jokes 

541.15 542.12 A: (( ooh )) 

543.77 544.56 A: [laughter] 

544.71 546.75 A: (( that is cute )) 

544.88 552.32 B: so they do get it earlier than we think that they do um and you're right they absorb everything i think from the time they're born 

552.23 553.80 A: yeah um 

552.83 555.52 B: they may not be able to articulate it but they 

555.65 557.15 B: they absorb it all 

557.39 562.50 A: i believe it 'cause i i watch him when he's watching certain shows or 

562.07 563.09 B: mhm 

562.48 575.23 A: we're listening to the radio and and you can see some things he's kinda looking at it like what especially you know they don't get it but the real simple things he seems to get it and he giggles at it and laughs at it so 

567.53 568.37 B: [laughter] 

570.22 570.99 B: (( they make )) 

571.43 572.41 B: yeah 

573.53 574.44 B: yeah 

574.53 580.65 B: yeah and it could just even be the tone of voice that somebody's using you know that he thinks is funny or 

581.18 584.31 B: the flash of colors on the screen or whatever so 

583.50 586.92 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

585.06 586.42 B: yeah it's fun 

587.49 591.20 A: i wish it was that easy to [laughter] laugh when you're a grown up 

590.83 593.03 B: yes [laughter] 

592.40 595.20 A: [noise] [mn] [noise] 

593.87 595.46 B: yeah no that's true ooh 

598.13 599.90 B: but are you having good weather down there
