65.98 77.27 A: all right well well extortion is pretty abundant in in here locally but the only people to make minimum wage is like ah

85.91 86.99 B: yeah 

89.47 97.41 B: yeah and then there's like fast food and like places like albertson's and well actually i don't i mean just like grocery markets

117.67 118.48 B: (( so )) 

119.10 119.92 A: (( mm )) 

119.84 122.60 B: it's it's kinda hard to be living off of minimum wage 

122.88 126.80 B: yeah it's especially if it's like five dollars 

126.59 133.52 A: well actually five dollars is the minimum wage i can make that off either the internet secret shopping ah 

134.20 146.21 A: which is mystery shopping off the internet do that you can make ten dollars an hour surveys off the internet ah anywhere from five to ten dollars an hour so minimum wage is like 

146.11 150.00 A: (( i just sit in front of a computer and beat minimum wage )) 

149.19 152.47 B: yeah that sad that's well gee don't even have to go out 

152.59 157.28 A: so um minimum wage what is that taking taxes out um 

157.96 163.70 A: welfare's better than that to tell you the truth that's the reason why so many people don't work that are down here 

163.61 170.54 B: yeah yeah like welfare i mean 'cause you get your food stamps and you get everything like paid for pretty much 

170.59 179.02 B: and then like five dollars is not very much to live off of especially if you're ah taking taxes out so let's just say you get about four an hour 

179.31 181.66 B: or you know maybe even less then 

181.69 183.59 B: that's not good so 

182.62 184.18 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

184.44 192.08 B: um like i mean it's hard it's hard 'cause you know you gotta buy food and then you gotta pay for like utilities and everything 

189.98 190.81 A: (( [noise] )) 

193.31 203.53 A: [noise] then and you and like in california i can't comprehend how [noise] you could really live [noise] off minimum wage whereas just down here would be better 'cause everything costs so much less 

203.74 208.47 B: yeah california is it's very tough to live in if you're just making minimum wage 

208.65 215.45 B: 'cause like food is expensive especially if you're up in san francisco everything is so much more expensive in san francisco 

215.03 217.69 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

216.39 220.76 B: but i i think the minimum wage up there is supposed to be more expensive too 

220.80 223.15 B: to go with the cost of living or something i'm 

223.73 224.52 A: mm 

223.74 227.40 B: not too positive on it still not too much 

225.71 233.89 A: well maybe the s- yeah the state government might kick in something to offset the minimum wage without the federal [noise] government they got that standard and that's it [noise] 

234.08 234.75 B: (( yeah )) 

234.44 238.75 A: and that's supposed to be nationwide and like i said down here 

240.44 246.26 A: unemployment's not that high it's like four or five percent it was less than four percent [sigh] 

246.06 247.92 B: (( that's pretty good but )) 

246.91 247.83 A: yeah 

247.78 250.17 B: it's pretty low over here in califor- i think it's 

250.01 264.81 B: actually i think it's gotten higher over the years but um it used to be pretty low a while back and then everything went haywire with the internet bust silicon valley went down hill and i think that made it rise a lot 

264.62 268.18 A: (( [noise] [cough] that and the yeah )) 

268.56 274.46 A: from what i've seen because i can say that moving out there it's a totally different country all together unfortunately 

274.85 275.85 A: and 

274.92 278.26 B: how i mean how's it in louisiana over there 

278.14 281.86 A: well i mean gas is a dollar twenty five ah 

281.02 282.06 B: no kidding 

282.13 287.60 A: yeah and i mean it's like ah well the cheapest one is and then you've got like 

287.82 298.17 A: ah [sigh] most air conditioning i was at a girl's house tonight she had air conditioning she lived in a trailer booth like she had a seventy dollar monthly bill 

298.53 303.36 A: so everything is real low and i know down there you can live off minimum wage with 

298.83 299.74 B: (( what wow )) 

303.81 307.48 A: ah buying utilities from another state 

307.56 309.53 A: and the brown outs 

310.10 311.59 A: from what i've seen 

311.79 318.19 A: um it's like ah the rent is so much higher i couldn't even comprehend how you could live off of it 

318.56 321.16 B: yeah it's it's extremely high i'm 

318.67 319.28 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

321.27 327.81 B: a dollar twenty five for gas w- we're paying like two dollars for the cheapest gas over here 

327.31 328.84 A: mhm 

328.77 333.55 B: and that's just for like you know unleaded yeah 

332.94 338.39 A: so you couldn't even to tell you the truth you couldn't even get to work [laughter] if you lived too far off 

336.17 337.00 B: (( no )) 

338.19 344.14 B: yeah you can't it's just it's way too expensive to to pay for gas i mean 

344.16 356.30 B: my room mate has a car i mean i don't have a car personally but my room mate has a car and i mean he's got this civic type of car i mean it's it's pretty good on gas mileage too 

352.67 353.83 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

356.35 363.83 B: and he's just he's complaining about gas and he only works about a five minute drive away 

356.59 357.25 A: (( [noise] )) 

363.94 374.99 B: so i mean he's working at a grocery store right now and he's definitely complaining he's saying pay's not high enough and h- he apparently had to join some kind of union in order to keep working there so 

375.16 383.45 B: he said forget it 'cause ah the union was gonna take too much money from him it was ah gonna take about two hundred dollars from him 

383.23 390.39 A: union dues monthly dues and ah to join the union yes the large lump sum 

383.59 384.51 B: and he 

388.45 389.65 B: yeah 

390.37 405.36 B: he can't he can't do it 'cause it's like it's like his two weeks pay goes to that and you know how's he supposed to pay for gas utilities food and you know tuition there's it get's hard and there's a i mean he's c- 

405.17 416.14 B: he's like his parents aren't really helping him out with tuition or anything so he's gotta he's gotta take care of those mainly himself and he's working off some loans and and whatever 

409.39 410.37 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

416.70 420.49 B: so i mean it's it's tough for him i see him struggling 

420.47 435.23 B: and i mean it's it's harder for me 'cause i mean i can't really work but i'm i'm luckier in the sense where my parents are helping me out and you know along with like scholarships and and like you know
