27.49 30.85 A: yeah [laughter] it's the best the best city in texas [laughter] 

28.21 29.66 B: [laughter] 

30.56 33.15 B: yeah it's pretty great um 

33.79 39.28 B: but yeah so you know minimum wage i guess you know who's gonna say that it shouldn't go up right 

38.29 39.60 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

40.32 41.72 B: i uh 

42.18 48.17 B: i think i don't know they said on the recording that it's like five fifteen or something but i think it's actually higher than that 

47.57 50.32 A: is it i thought it was five fifteen i don't know 

50.33 51.88 B: i think maybe well there's like 

52.30 57.00 B: well also like here in california the minimum wage i think is like six twenty five or something 

56.82 59.21 A: oh that's pretty good 

57.33 58.36 B: so there's like 

58.66 63.98 B: but that's like a state thing for sure 'cause the federal minimum wage is around five bucks and something 

63.86 66.09 A: yeah well [noise] 

64.99 66.26 B: but uh 

67.50 68.71 B: it's too low 

67.70 68.66 A: i mean 

68.69 70.59 A: yeah it is because 

70.67 71.67 A: i mean 

71.72 72.68 A: um 

73.24 75.31 A: i was talking to this professor one time 

75.34 76.53 A: and um 

77.17 81.66 A: he said that his students uh figured out what the 

81.67 82.60 A: um 

83.22 85.35 A: how much they felt that 

85.62 86.60 A: um the 

87.41 97.21 A: like a person needed to live on for a year and it was it was a lot more than what the government said where they set the poverty levels or whatever 

97.42 105.94 B: [noise] yeah for sure and i think even if you if you do make minimum wage and you work full time like you're still probably below the poverty level anyway like 

97.61 98.41 A: (( you know )) 

98.78 99.66 A: yeah 

105.35 106.64 A: yeah definitely 

106.86 108.08 B: it's um 

108.16 113.61 B: like if you have a family or anything like you probably like qualify for food stamps and everything [noise] and uh 

114.45 125.73 B: you know it's just like i don't know the kinda stuff you read about too is like companies like walmart and stuff that you know have millions of people working for them but they're all like working thirty nine hours a week you know [noise] just so they get out of paying benefits and stuff 

125.62 126.84 A: yeah 

126.18 128.54 B: so it's like those are the kind of jobs where 

128.73 139.11 B: you know those are the that's who's getting minimum wage is like part time workers and you know it's like it's like the retail jobs and the fast food jobs and stuff those are the people that are getting minimum wage and 

137.43 139.03 A: (( yeah um [noise] )) 

139.52 141.55 B: (( [noise] i don't know it's like )) 

142.04 142.78 B: huh 

142.75 145.03 A: how much do you think it should be raised to 

145.62 146.75 B: i think [noise] 

147.43 148.40 B: i mean 

149.08 160.58 B: honestly i mean i think it could be doubled you know because it's sort of like it's something that would sorta maybe start to cause inflation a little bit because then all the stores are gonna raise their prices [noise] but it's like 

160.58 164.11 B: putting money in the pockets of people who are making the least is like 

164.29 178.44 B: you know it's like one of those basic like democrat republican issues you know like where you know that the democrats are always for raising it and the republicans wanna lower it and it's like either you're on the side of business or like people or you know and it's sort of like 

173.54 174.53 A: yeah 

176.79 179.15 A: or people yeah 

179.81 180.65 A: which is 

179.93 181.26 B: i think it 

180.69 182.19 A: really sad 

182.30 183.32 B: yeah 

182.64 184.14 A: because i mean 

184.15 185.83 A: of course people are more important 

186.44 187.40 A: and 

186.70 187.50 B: which 

187.53 193.09 B: yeah it's like well it's one of those things that makes republicans look really bad because it is like the congress that decides the minimum wage 

193.14 194.82 B: and they they have these 

195.16 202.72 B: you know these things come up and it's like it's pretty much [noise] straight down the line i think as far as i can tell that the republicans are the ones that don't wanna 

202.31 204.93 A: yeah they they just profit and not 

203.05 203.92 B: (( raise it )) 

205.20 206.25 A: and not 

206.38 208.12 A: (( what's important you know )) 

207.96 210.00 B: yeah and it's like 

210.13 214.85 B: yeah it's just like the kind of job where you're [noise] you're getting minimum wage you're like 

215.14 217.41 B: you know just like it's the kind of people that really 

217.67 219.84 B: need the money the most so 

220.70 222.15 A: yeah 

221.82 222.45 B: (( [noise] )) 

222.68 224.11 B: but uh 

225.45 228.29 B: they and they haven't raised it like 

228.35 231.40 B: (( in a long time i think to just )) 

230.01 232.36 A: [mn] yeah i think it was like 

232.45 234.35 A: (( five years ago i don't know )) 

234.35 235.74 B: yeah it's been 

235.89 239.10 B: (( it's been a long time it definitely hasn't kept up with inflation you know )) 

238.93 240.47 A: no not at all 

239.36 241.63 B: [noise] 'cause that's like 

241.92 250.33 B: somewhere between like three and five percent a year or something and it's been like yeah it's been like for a long time it's been around five bucks 

250.39 251.34 B: so 

251.61 252.36 B: (( [noise] )) 

252.44 254.87 A: how much would would that be in a year 

254.96 255.82 B: huh 

255.99 259.29 A: how much would that total to in a year if like 

258.57 261.89 B: well i think i figure that it was like 

261.99 268.05 B: about two hundred if you worked forty hours for five dollars it's about two hundred and forty dollars a week 

264.26 265.20 A: yeah 

267.76 270.43 A: oh that's pretty yeah that's pretty bad 

269.39 270.52 B: and then 

270.71 273.38 B: but then you gotta figure there's taxes too right so 

273.55 276.90 B: by the time you know you're probably taking home like two hundred bucks a week 

277.16 278.78 A: [noise] mhm 

277.35 279.85 B: you know after taxes and everything 

280.19 281.33 B: so 

282.62 284.33 B: you know that would be like maybe 

284.99 288.25 B: well i guess about maybe like ten grand a year or something 

288.22 289.52 A: yeah and that's 

290.31 291.88 A: that's horribly low [laughter] 

291.62 295.66 B: yeah i mean it's pretty insane 'cause like even for a yeah i don't think i mean 

295.98 303.11 B: that means you're living on like it's under a thousand dollars a month i don't i mean it's just like no one can possibly survive on that right 

302.60 303.50 A: right 

304.94 308.36 A: [noise] but i mean okay so if if they were to raise it 

308.62 312.16 A: i mean where do you think sacrifices would have to be made 

312.92 322.05 B: well you know something obviously you know it's like prices are gonna go up right like for some things like or just you know what i mean like the stores aren't gonna 

322.09 328.86 B: just go and make less money you know like so they're gonna like raise their prices a little bit but in a way it's like 

328.88 331.78 B: i don't i don't mind you know really i 

331.31 333.37 A: yeah 

332.28 344.24 B: i mean i guess it's kind of like there's some screwed up thing about it maybe where it's like causing inflation right because [noise] it's those people are making more money but then they have everything's costing more because everybody's making more money but 

344.67 346.27 B: i don't know i mean i don't 

346.46 361.31 B: i don't see you know and it's like maybe like the way that well the way they try to frame it when it's like you know the republican thing is like oh it's like small businesses that really you know can't afford to pay people or or won't be able to hire as many people so there won't be as many jobs but these are like the crappiest jobs in the world anyway 

361.61 363.14 A: yeah 

362.49 363.38 B: so 

364.15 371.44 B: i just can't see i mean any way like you just have to be a complete jerk to say that it [laughter] it couldn't go up really 

372.26 373.77 B: but 

374.17 375.49 B: [lipsmack] i don't know [mn] 

375.57 386.92 B: it seems to me like i mean i get an hourly wage at my work and like i get i'm making like a little like around ten dollars an hour and it's like it's hardly anything you know it's really not very much money 

382.30 384.25 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

386.84 387.92 A: (( i know )) 

388.25 396.44 B: and i'm like 'cause i'm like twenty nine and i remember like the minimum wage in my my first job was like three twenty five or something 

396.58 397.54 A: whoa 

396.74 397.72 B: (( and )) 

397.82 399.26 B: (( that was )) 

399.28 402.81 B: but that was like fifteen years ago now maybe 'cause i was in high school 

402.93 404.27 A: yeah 

403.64 405.10 B: but um 

405.57 410.02 B: but you know they say like all the prices everything doubles like every ten years so it should be 

410.04 414.02 B: it should definitely be at least a little bit higher than that just for inflation 

412.48 413.60 A: yeah 

415.73 417.30 B: but uh 

418.41 429.09 B: and i guess it's like i don't know i mean it's just a lot of these places are making a ton of money like all the retailers every mall every mall job like you start at the minimum wage and the stores are making a killing you know 

426.32 427.73 A: [noise] definitely 

429.15 431.64 A: yeah all the c._e._o.s and stuff 

431.81 433.24 A: get it all [laughter] 

432.94 440.38 B: right and it's just like yeah i think you know it's like the amounts that they're paying you have to like value people more you know than 

440.52 442.21 B: [noise] i think just as like a 

442.35 446.64 B: it's like a moral issue kind of you know it's just like value people more than 

447.02 452.67 B: than profits or like to not be as concerned about the health of like the corporation 

453.09 454.84 A: yeah 

453.37 462.60 B: you know how people are how like people are doing and especially like the people that are making the least amount of money like aren't those the people you're supposed to have the most empathy for anyway you know 

462.61 463.80 B: (( [noise] )) 

463.80 472.60 A: yeah i i read i read this article once about how a lot of u._s. companies and british companies spent a lot of um 

472.84 476.55 A: had a lot of factories in like thailand and stuff for cheap labor 

476.67 477.96 A: and it it was 

478.22 480.10 A: really horrible because 

479.90 481.10 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

480.81 487.07 A: i mean i knew this kind of stuff went on but i didn't know how bad it was but it was all for profits and the people um 

487.57 490.39 A: like the workers in the other countries had like 

490.75 494.20 A: nothing and the conditions were horrible and then 

494.53 498.18 A: and then there at one of the factories in thailand um 

498.97 499.82 A: the 

500.66 501.55 A: um 

501.56 504.59 A: the safety conditions were really bad and they were just 

504.61 511.80 A: trying to keep it at a minimum so that they didn't have to deal with everything and there was a big fire and like a lot of the employees died 

511.89 514.14 A: and and they just tried to like 

514.79 515.69 A: um 

515.98 518.21 A: not say anything about it because 

518.37 520.94 A: they didn't want people to find out how horrible this 

521.57 524.98 A: stuff was it was all just to get money 

525.30 534.70 B: yeah i mean i guess that kinda reminds me and makes me think of uh of like you know what's the minimum wage in mexico supposed to be or whatever and like wow these american like manufacturing jobs are going there and stuff 

534.93 536.33 A: yeah 

535.71 540.56 B: but it's already like there's such a huge difference between places like that and here like i don't think [noise] 

540.94 544.08 B: (( you know those kind of jobs are gonna be anyway )) 

543.95 545.93 A: yeah 

546.12 547.26 B: (( you know but )) 

546.16 547.21 A: (( i don't know )) 

549.23 550.91 B: (( [noise] i don't know )) 

553.45 560.64 B: but yes if you work a whole day for five bucks an hour how much do you get in a day it's like forty bucks or something is that right yeah 

559.87 561.60 A: yeah something like that 

561.63 564.26 B: that's not much money to take home 

564.01 564.90 A: no 

564.85 566.19 B: [laughter] 

565.55 570.11 A: [laughter] i mean you'd never be able to take take out your family for a nice dinner or anything 

566.41 567.62 B: it's kinda 

569.55 576.04 B: no that's yeah and it's like it's definitely the kind of jobs where you like you're on your feet the whole time you know and just like 

575.48 585.14 A: yeah and of course like a lot of the people who are working these jobs have like a lot of kids to take care of which makes the problem even worse 

576.86 577.80 B: and they're like 

582.58 583.96 B: yeah for sure 

586.45 592.93 B: but yeah i mean they're definitely they're not desk jobs right it's like you you're flipping burgers or like selling tee shirts or something where you're just like 

592.01 593.74 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

593.42 598.49 B: (( you're probably pretty tired at the end of the day i mean it's sort of like depressing to think about really )) 

598.64 599.95 A: (( and the thing that bothers ))
