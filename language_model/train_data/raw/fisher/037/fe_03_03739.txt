69.54 70.41 A: right 

73.04 74.90 B: you'll have to work too much 

75.89 76.81 B: you know 

76.92 80.68 A: [lipsmack] right i guess my thoughts are on 

81.40 85.43 A: if it's for every um [lipsmack] 

86.95 89.39 A: every job then 

89.43 90.50 A: um 

91.48 102.17 A: especially in this economy that they younger kids you know the high school and college kids aren't gonna be able to get jobs because employers aren't gonna be able to pay them 

102.61 103.63 A: um 

104.31 109.98 A: or you know the price of a check book or a loans gonna go up to cover higher wages 

110.75 111.76 A: um 

110.75 111.56 B: (( uh )) 

113.02 113.62 A: (( [noise] )) 

113.92 114.74 B: (( so you )) 

114.11 118.30 A: you know a a f a family means different than you know uh 

120.34 122.26 A: no one to support 

122.89 128.73 A: but you know a lot of those jobs are um minimum wage jobs are taken up by 

129.45 131.17 A: people trying to 

131.36 136.24 A: um get a better education and trying to put themselves through school and 

135.73 136.68 B: yes 

138.05 139.22 B: that's true 

139.31 141.20 B: that's true that's definitely true 

141.47 143.73 B: yeah i'm i'm a student myself 

143.89 145.75 B: so i know what you mean 

146.11 148.40 B: that is true we usually yeah 

148.76 152.64 B: i mean but but still i don't know just paying so little 

152.67 162.73 B: i know the economy i mean a lot of people is is against it because of the way you were you know you pay the it plays a bigger role on the overall economy 

162.80 163.97 A: right 

163.34 165.41 B: if they you know if it goes up 

165.57 168.06 B: then a lot of things will you know 

168.64 171.99 B: will go up i know in california there is a big debate 

172.42 175.45 B: on whether or not they should raise minimum wage and stuff 

176.96 177.87 B: so 

177.14 180.75 A: oh i didn't realize it was by state i thought it was a federal 

181.18 184.88 A: mandate or is they looking at doing something higher 

186.56 189.36 B: well did they say it was [mn] is it 

189.40 192.73 B: r- raising the federal or the state i don't i didn't 

192.10 194.57 A: i i thought it was a federal law [noise] 

194.94 196.55 B: oh really 

196.57 198.86 A: i didn't realize it was a state i 

196.73 197.49 B: (( well i )) 

198.90 201.35 B: think it's within the state as well 

201.45 204.48 B: 'cause not all the states have the same minimum wage 

206.93 207.74 A: hm 

207.69 210.14 B: some places like in pennsylvania 

210.25 212.65 B: i think it's five twenty five 

212.46 214.33 A: so it's higher than the federal 

214.71 216.44 B: probably so 

216.28 217.19 A: okay 

219.06 225.87 B: but um i used to work for minimum wage in a uh clothing store when i was in high school 

226.21 232.07 B: and i used to work eight hours and still only receive a two hundred dollar paycheck a week 

232.27 234.43 B: for forty hours of work 

235.61 240.81 B: so i don't know i in in my opinion i i don't know i would like for them to be raised a little bit 

238.25 239.21 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

239.57 242.79 A: and i have worked um yeah minimum wage 

242.89 246.71 A: many uh you know in high school and um 

247.22 249.84 A: in college as well um 

249.94 253.83 A: but my thought is would i have the job if 

253.95 257.62 A: it got priced so high they couldn't have as many people working 

257.81 258.87 B: (( mm yeah )) 

258.15 262.02 A: so is two hundred dollars better than nothing [laughter] 

261.31 264.39 B: well that's that's not only true but still 

263.35 264.10 A: (( [noise] )) 

264.43 266.60 B: you know a lot of people you know 

266.65 269.95 B: i mean yes its' a lot of college students the one 

270.03 272.24 B: that are um that 

272.46 283.68 B: are you know getting these jobs and stuff but also a lot of people just like coming off welfare you know it's that stuff that are that are getting this lower paying jobs 

274.53 275.71 A: mhm 

284.12 285.56 B: and um 

286.21 291.78 B: i mean some of them are not making sufficient money for the amount of work they're putting in 

291.81 298.69 B: especially the people that are coming out of welfare they probably be thinking why shall i keep working so hard 

298.80 306.98 B: and make so little when i can just sit and wait for a check to come to me and by doing nothing 

306.84 316.99 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] well uh that's uh to me a whole nother subject of welfare reform and no i agree especially where insurance is concerned if they get a job and then 

317.20 319.78 A: welfare won't cover their insurance then 

319.29 320.60 B: yeah 

319.97 321.76 A: then you have that insured 

322.12 323.39 A: but um 

325.01 328.13 A: you know i think when you get to the welfare that's a whole nother 

328.55 330.42 A: a whole nother ball of flack 

329.81 333.70 B: well [noise] yeah but i'm just saying you know if they had like a better 

332.57 336.89 A: but then you ha- you have um you know also all the people who 

337.04 340.03 A: uh works in the school systems and have to 

340.30 342.26 A: for the wives who 

342.47 343.49 A: um 

343.63 345.97 A: who work in the school system 

346.02 347.46 A: and schools are 

347.59 351.92 A: are already so underfunded and i mean as teachers' teachers' aids 

352.28 356.23 A: who make so little money and 

352.36 353.43 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

358.71 361.46 A: (( [lipsmack] you know positions )) 

361.53 364.93 A: which i think is worse for the students 

365.29 366.65 B: mm yes that's for real 

365.88 367.06 A: um 

367.48 368.65 A: you know so 

370.24 371.81 A: you know i can feel so- 

372.01 377.58 A: [mn] there's pros and cons but i think there there could ultimately be a lot of losses 

378.70 385.61 A: um especially in this economy we're seeing at this time i just i have um 

386.26 390.67 A: a husband right now we're thankful he has a job because he's in the telecom industry 

390.70 392.01 B: oh okay 

391.68 392.83 A: um 

393.02 395.79 A: you know so it's not just the minimum wage 

396.01 397.03 A: um 

397.24 402.42 A: i i can't tell you how many friends i have who have lost their jobs and these are college educated people 

402.19 403.32 B: mhm 

403.64 408.36 A: um but because of the industry right now they're unemployed or 

408.60 414.74 A: you know they're i've i have one who actually is working at home depot you know to to make money and 

414.08 415.04 B: mhm 

415.04 420.60 A: um you know and if he loses that job because minimum wage goes up and they have to cut people huh 

420.41 421.62 B: mm yeah that is 

420.85 422.65 A: it's a vicious cycle 

422.68 423.59 B: it is 

422.84 425.77 A: now just doesn't seem to be the time to do it 

426.20 427.20 B: it is 

427.61 432.02 B: it is definitely a vicious cycle it's really it's more complicated than 

432.30 435.73 B: than you saying yes we're gonna raise minimum wage 

432.45 433.38 A: yeah 

435.40 440.98 A: right and i'm you know and i'm not against looking at raising it down the road 

436.24 437.34 B: or not 

440.99 445.19 A: but with the economy the way it is i just think it's the wrong time 

444.96 448.40 B: well maybe they could raise minimum wage 

448.56 454.52 B: a bit and give like the smaller businesses cut them a break on taxes 

454.98 456.26 B: (( you know what i mean )) 

456.88 462.47 B: that'll help offset the pain of you know the paying people 

463.04 464.77 B: you know a higher rate 

464.89 465.95 A: right 

465.62 467.45 B: you know what i mean and then 

467.61 473.82 B: by these people earning more money they still i mean the government are still gonna get you know taxes off of 'em 

475.08 477.20 B: and you understand what i mean 

477.50 479.14 A: (( [noise] [noise] um )) 

480.09 482.72 A: somewhat i mean you didn't just to 

482.78 486.27 A: doing payroll taxes and oth- um 

486.65 487.21 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

488.27 492.62 A: yeah th- they stay and well paid on this state um 

493.50 494.93 A: for government 

495.43 496.49 A: um 

496.65 501.87 A: a lot of places get upset when you give companies tax breaks [laughter] [sigh] 

500.20 501.87 B: mhm mm yeah 

502.49 508.45 A: so once again that's the way i see it w- you make one group happy you make another one upset [sigh] 

508.86 509.86 A: um 

510.30 511.25 B: (( o- oh )) 

511.19 511.93 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

511.28 514.73 B: i don't know maybe i'm too much of an optimist [laughter] mm 

512.18 512.87 A: (( yes )) 

513.97 519.22 A: (( [laughter] i consider i i am not against um )) 

519.63 524.28 A: looking at a minimum wage just just the timing of it right now with this economy 

524.59 525.62 B: yes 

524.99 531.72 A: when you have so many um uh living here in dallas texas 

532.74 537.16 A: [noise] you know every time i turn around someone's just lost their job 

537.33 538.50 B: (( [noise] mm yes )) 

538.01 548.29 A: i have th- um three four teacher friends just at one small school whose husbands are now are currently unemployed and those are just the ones where i know their private lives 

549.13 550.29 A: um 

551.27 552.83 A: and then to 

552.97 555.42 A: (( i i think myself um )) 

555.71 559.93 A: raising that you're gonna find that more people lose their jobs [noise] because of it [noise] 

561.47 565.69 A: but as the economy turns around then i think it needs to be revisited 

566.31 567.22 B: oh 

567.47 571.30 B: oh is you know these telephones are kinda weird because it's hard to 

571.44 574.06 B: to hear like you know clearly 

574.40 577.23 B: what the other person is saying on the other end 

578.46 579.03 A: (( [noise] )) 

579.04 579.86 B: (( kinda )) 

579.94 581.69 B: (( i don't know i'll probably ))

585.25 590.13 B: no you know it's not no i don't think it is your phone this this is not the first time it happened 

589.63 590.82 A: (( oh okay )) 

590.45 597.19 B: yeah with the like the last person i was speaking to it was really hard to make out what they were saying 

595.30 596.51 A: (( mm [lipsmack] )) 

598.44 599.89 A: i know i got called a couple of nights
