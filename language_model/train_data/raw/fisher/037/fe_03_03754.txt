17.17 20.22 B: wow the person i talked to two days ago was too [mn] 

19.72 21.70 A: oh really huh 

20.82 24.36 B: mhm that's what happens in the evening you get 

22.17 23.36 A: that's cool 

24.45 26.50 B: cali- fellow californians [laughter] 

25.49 30.34 A: yeah i was gonna say i doubt that too many people on the east coast are up at this time 

30.20 32.62 B: (( [laughter] i hope not )) 

32.17 33.32 A: yeah 

33.47 34.23 B: (( [mn] )) 

33.57 36.74 A: so our topic is uh minimum wage 

37.08 38.27 B: yeah 

37.56 39.32 A: being raised 

40.09 43.85 B: i still think five fifteen an hour given i 

40.09 41.10 A: uh 

43.96 47.43 B: i personally feel like it ought be a lot more than that 

47.15 48.52 A: yeah well 

49.26 50.28 A: um 

50.77 54.51 A: we just i just moved to california in the last eight months 

54.79 58.63 A: and it seems like there is a different 

59.18 62.65 A: i mean five fifteen here doesn't go very far 

62.63 64.27 B: where did you move from 

62.99 63.67 A: (( [noise] )) 

63.77 65.89 A: um i came from utah 

66.14 69.94 A: and things are a lot cheaper there like our rent 

66.28 67.42 B: okay 

70.03 74.23 A: uh for a one bedroom here it's eight seventy five and that's pretty low for 

72.88 73.71 B: mhm 

74.71 78.66 A: for what we could find the same thing was like 

76.29 77.07 B: yeah 

79.03 80.40 A: four fifty 

80.49 81.94 A: in utah so 

82.48 86.02 A: in california definitely it i think it needs to be higher 

86.10 90.81 A: 'cause people that have to survive on five fifteen an hour aren't gonna get very far 

90.59 96.57 B: no i know that i see articles here in the paper all the time about people having to share 

96.58 107.03 B: you know like having like four people to a two bedroom apartment because they're trying to live on a minimum wage and actually here i think in san francisco i think they've 

99.74 100.72 A: yeah 

107.28 121.35 B: i wouldn't say i've seen it seen it posters i think they they have like a living wage that they've instituted like for city workers and i think it's at six fifteen or something like that but it's i know it's higher than five fifteen 

115.19 116.34 A: oh really 

118.20 118.89 A: (( uh )) 

120.87 121.78 A: uh-huh 

121.75 129.91 B: 'cause when i heard this qu- this question i thought actually that the minimum wage was about six dollars an hour and in fact it was lower than that 

129.30 136.20 A: yeah i thought i didn't realize that it was being raised to to five fifteen i thought it was close to that already 

134.27 135.19 B: yeah 

137.33 143.72 B: but i yeah i agree here in california that it's that isn't a livable wage 

143.14 145.26 A: (( mm mm not at all )) 

144.00 144.87 B: no way 

145.79 151.44 B: and you can see high schools kids that are living under their parents' roof might be able to deal with it but that's about it not 

150.70 155.46 A: yeah it seems hard to um to come up with a way though that 

151.57 152.86 B: (( not a family )) 

155.81 158.22 A: i mean i don't know if 

158.26 161.65 A: there should be a state minimum wage or 

161.96 169.78 A: i i don't know how to reconcile that 'cause on the other hand a lot of times jobs that you are doing minimum wage for they're not 

164.62 165.29 B: [mn] 

170.21 175.17 A: i mean they don't necessarily require tons of education or experience 

175.14 176.25 B: mhm 

175.39 177.39 A: so it seems like well you don't wanna 

177.95 179.24 A: (( pay )) 

178.25 179.34 B: over pay 

179.56 181.50 A: tons and tons because then 

181.58 182.71 B: yeah 

182.10 191.14 A: what's the point of getting an education if you can work a perfectly great minimum wage job and still have your satellite t._v. your nice car and [laughter] 

190.38 193.09 B: [laughter] all the amenities 

192.56 193.84 A: right 

193.87 208.26 B: but you know you that's a good point though about having a state minimum wage because that would take into account the differences in the cost of living which are drastic i mean uh i know one of my best friends lived used to live in utah she just moved about six months ago 

200.36 201.32 A: yeah 

202.62 203.80 A: oh yeah 

207.63 208.64 A: mhm 

208.43 213.78 B: and i was ap- just appal- appalled at the difference in the cost of living it's 

213.27 214.33 A: yeah 

213.95 215.44 B: incredible 

214.86 216.30 A: yeah 

216.00 220.89 B: and uh like the minimum wage is definitely going to go a lot farther in utah than it is here 

219.91 221.60 A: oh yeah definitely 

222.34 223.37 B: (( but i )) 

222.43 225.61 A: yeah have you always been in san francisco or are you 

226.16 232.13 B: um no not always i i grew up about fifty miles north but i've always been in the bay area 

231.39 232.33 A: uh-huh 

232.41 233.38 B: so 

232.45 236.41 A: yeah i love the bay area i spent a summer in merrin 

236.50 237.67 B: oh yeah 

237.07 244.04 A: yeah and like it was like oh i love san francisco i could never afford to live here [laughter] 

238.26 239.72 B: yeah it's beautiful 

243.62 254.52 B: [laughter] well i must say like i'm fortunate that i have rent control and i think that's that is that is the main reason that i'm still here now [laughter] because if it weren't for rent control i couldn't afford to live here 

250.77 251.76 A: (( mhm )) 

254.93 257.59 B: as it is it's really pricey i 

256.70 257.65 A: mhm 

257.82 259.14 B: oh my god 

259.20 260.48 B: (( [mn] )) 

260.80 267.45 B: if i had to live on minimum wage there's no way i would have to have like eight roommates [laughter] but 

263.68 264.70 A: yeah 

265.80 266.95 A: [laughter] 

268.55 269.87 A: yeah 

270.11 273.64 B: so but i think you you raise a good point though with the education 

274.28 279.37 B: that i think people they educate the incentive to get education is 

279.66 283.43 B: is both financial but i i also think it's for your own 

283.52 285.79 B: you know for your own mental growth 

285.02 286.44 A: yeah 

286.49 289.53 A: yeah i i think so too it's uh 

289.94 297.25 A: well i was uh a humanities major i just actually finished my masters degree in french and people were always saying 

297.20 307.21 A: oh french what are you gonna do with that and and there was a usually were the people that were you know in a very practical obvious 

300.19 301.39 B: (( [noise] [noise] [laughter] )) 

307.27 310.98 A: field of study like you know business or 

307.42 308.45 B: trade 

310.37 311.94 B: mhm 

311.90 318.39 A: computer science or something you know and i didn't really know necessarily i wasn't doing it to 

318.62 321.61 A: well i'm headed for this career you know it was just 

322.02 329.54 B: i have found that too with friends that were in those real practical minded major- majors like business or accounting 

329.18 330.23 A: (( mhm )) 

329.89 339.23 B: they're very goal oriented and it's very clear to them they're gonna have this business get this business degree can they you know get to c._f._o. of the company [laughter] 

332.10 333.12 A: mhm 

338.24 339.13 A: right 

339.49 344.71 B: and make x. amount of dollars and i didn't fall into that category either it's 

344.01 344.97 A: (( [laughter] )) 

345.19 346.08 B: how they 

346.19 350.92 B: i was a physiology major and i thought i was gonna to go to med school [laughter] 

349.93 351.25 A: (( mhm )) 

351.36 355.40 B: and i didn't i ended up in human resources instead [laughter] 

355.82 359.94 B: um which doesn't doesn't pay a whole lot of money but 

360.26 361.32 B: that's okay 

360.58 362.38 A: but more than minimum wage [laughter] 

362.80 366.04 B: yeah [laughter] yeah that's for sure [laughter] 

366.41 367.86 A: yeah 

366.62 367.49 B: god 

367.66 371.26 B: no i really like your idea of the state minimum wage though 

371.16 374.58 A: well i don't know i don't know how 

374.97 376.28 B: how you measure 

375.27 377.11 A: you know it makes me wonder 

377.20 379.79 A: they i'm sure they've they must have 

379.87 382.68 A: considered it before i mean it just doesn't seem 

383.74 385.75 A: practical to have a blanket 

386.00 389.04 A: wage for the whole country considering 

389.19 391.11 A: the difference costs costs 

391.49 394.14 A: of living in different regions and 

391.65 392.70 B: (( well then )) 

394.56 395.50 A: (( i don't know )) 

394.68 408.18 B: i think but you know then you look at like when they how they assess taxes if you look from i mean how much like like school like educational systems vary from county to county depending on how much money they have at their disposal 

406.87 408.31 A: oh that's true 

408.60 413.04 B: and that's that's not equitable aroun- across the country 

412.74 414.24 A: that's very true 

414.66 419.98 B: which doesn't mean it's right but there's another [laughter] case in point where it's not exactly working 

420.61 428.83 B: but then then they're be kinda cert- strain the realm of like being socialistic [laughter] society if you try to make it all 

426.47 428.09 A: (( mhm right )) 

428.84 430.59 B: absolutely 

430.98 432.00 B: equal 

431.71 433.10 A: yeah 

434.10 434.75 B: (( [lipsmack] mm )) 

434.94 436.13 A: (( mm ))

459.92 462.28 B: god i didn't know it had been going on that long 

462.99 470.90 A: yeah i think they they've changed it a little 'cause the the um opening menu was a lot more clear this time the voice was different and 

471.12 471.69 B: (( mm )) 

471.94 472.88 A: (( but [lipsmack] )) 

472.25 474.09 B: how did you find out about it

509.38 512.08 B: some of some of the companies are very good 

511.46 521.88 A: 'cause i've heard of mystery shopping and i've considered it but i was like [mn] i've never met a mystery shopper so i was a little wary you know 'cause it sounds too good to be true 

519.10 520.93 B: (( [laughter] yeah i know )) 

522.41 525.11 B: well i don't think you can get rich at it
