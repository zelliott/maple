6.58 7.61 B: (( are you )) 

7.15 8.40 A: pretty good 

7.79 12.45 B: good so i guess we're supposed to talk about comedy and humor 

11.99 12.85 A: (( mhm )) 

12.72 22.26 B: and uh i understand that we're to discuss what we find acceptable and what we feel is in bad taste okay do you wanna start or shall i 

19.02 20.01 A: right 

21.52 23.85 A: mm you go ahead 

23.40 24.90 B: okay well 

25.19 40.04 B: in my way of looking at it i think if if it's going to be something that makes people feel badly especially about themselves then it's not funny that that would to me would be in bad taste uh [mn] but i know 

40.06 51.79 B: everybody laughs when you're watching television and somebody falls down you know does a prat fall that's always been funny for years and years but as far as what's good and bad taste 

47.23 48.38 A: mhm 

52.18 56.39 B: i don't know i it's often things are close to the line don't you think 

55.79 57.49 A: yeah i do think 

57.77 60.13 B: yeah can you think of anything that 

58.84 60.84 A: i feel the same um 

61.09 65.86 A: well the way i feel about it is anything like i have two young children 

65.58 66.84 B: mhm 

66.02 68.73 A: and so i tend to anything that 

69.17 73.72 A: you know i feel that's racist or things like that you know that 

73.75 78.19 A: other people may think are funny i don't tend to think that's very funny 

77.72 82.01 B: right i i agree with you and uh certainly 

82.10 86.62 B: i don't know anything that you wouldn't want said with your name attached to it you know 

86.10 87.32 A: exactly 

86.72 97.90 B: [laughter] i think that's kind of a rule of thumb would you repea- if you hear something would you repeat it i don't know if i'm always brave enough in a group if somebody says something that i don't like i 

98.16 102.89 B: you know i don't always pipe up and say i think that's not funny [laughter] do you [noise] 

101.25 108.88 A: right i tend to have a very dry sense of humor so i'm like you know things that you know that you know th- there are things that 

109.32 112.69 A: i'm not much for the slapstick type of humor 

112.17 113.46 B: mhm 

112.82 116.75 A: you know now my eldest daughter tends to enjoy that kind of thing 

116.49 117.65 B: mhm 

116.96 120.18 A: you know movies and stuff she tends to enjoy that kind of ting 

118.82 122.39 B: sounds like my boys who always love the three stooges 

121.64 123.21 A: my daughter does 

122.68 124.67 B: [laughter] 

123.98 132.76 A: but i'm kinda more you know like i said the things that you know that my husband and my girls wouldn't necessarily catch you know i'm like get a chuckle out of it 

132.12 146.83 B: exactly yeah i think i tend more towards the dry humor type stuff too play on words i think those are particularly funny and uh but as far as again if the topic is you know what's in bad taste 

136.25 137.20 A: yeah 

139.94 140.97 A: right 

147.05 159.89 B: oh anything most things sexual i think are you know in bad taste uh and i you know i don't like that and that's why well that's why i don't watch sitcoms on television 

149.81 151.82 A: yeah i'm that way 

158.55 161.25 A: yeah i don't generally either 

160.67 168.55 B: 'cause i've watched a few minutes of a number of 'em and i think they're horrible but then i'm i'm probably older than you 'cause my kids are all grown up 

168.59 169.99 B: and 

168.66 170.78 A: oh i'm in my mid thirties 

170.12 173.54 B: and i'm in fifties [laughter] 

171.88 180.53 A: yeah but i'm ten- i tend to be pretty conservative as far as you know as far as what i watch and as far as what i allow my children to watch 

179.92 189.63 B: mhm yeah well i think it's good to to monitor the kids and see what they're they're seeing and you know 'cause it's so easy for them to misunderstand so 

188.54 193.97 A: right and some of the language is just you know 'cause i tend to i really watch 

194.08 202.60 A: you know my husband and i really wat- try to watch what we say and what we do and some of the language is just not i mean even prime time is like 

197.31 198.23 B: yeah 

198.97 199.56 B: (( [mn] )) 

200.52 201.67 B: it's horrible 

202.46 203.43 B: yeah 

202.98 205.25 A: it's just not fit for them to hear 

204.80 218.47 B: yeah it it it does it's getting worse all the time i don't like that at all uh and i know their excuses in hollywood always is well that's the way people talk but i don't know people who talk like that 

212.11 214.08 A: mhm 

218.24 228.27 B: uh we we never swear in our house uh well [laughter] let's say once in my husband never swears i might once 

223.15 224.46 A: (( [laughter] )) 

226.06 227.35 A: right 

228.32 230.66 B: in a while but um 

228.92 229.90 A: right 

230.87 236.95 B: you know it's it's just that uh i don't think i mean neither in work or our social groups 

236.74 247.93 B: we don't hear the filthy language that i don't we don't go movies but i understand there's a lot of nasty words in movies and it's almost like part of the conversation it's just built in there 

243.36 244.76 A: right mhm 

247.96 250.71 B: and i don't i don't like that at all 

250.34 265.03 A: i just don't under- i don't the thing i don't understand is why that they think they have to do this i mean i know they have to do this in order to get ratings but it's like there's just so much that you know so much of it is just like it has become common place 

258.10 259.06 B: yeah 

264.64 269.00 B: yeah and what bothers me about it if i'm watching something 

268.86 272.22 B: and there's some language in it that i find offensive 

272.02 284.31 B: it just throws me off the track and i lose the gist of the story because i'm thinking about now why did they have to say that [laughter] and i lose my concentration on the story so that that bothers me a lot 

273.97 275.26 A: mhm 

281.42 282.44 A: mhm 

283.03 296.89 A: yes that's like i said that's just like with you know as far as comedy goes now i let 'em watch like you know like we've watched bill crosby and he's pretty you know he's pretty clean and he's pretty he's pretty on target but there's a lot of 'em you know 

290.98 292.14 B: mhm 

292.79 294.80 B: he's very good yeah 

296.90 304.43 A: that my daughter'll see commercials for and she's like can we watch that and i'm like you let me watch it first and if i think it's something that you need to see 

304.38 305.78 B: yeah good for you 

304.55 306.83 A: you know then i will 

307.10 309.87 A: because i think censorship lies with parents 

309.58 313.87 B: absolutely yeah and it's uh my daughter does the same 

313.96 321.20 B: when my kids were little there there wasn't hardly anything offensive on television it just didn't happen and 

318.20 319.34 A: right 

321.10 328.70 B: uh i mean we were watching mary tyler moore and dick van [laughter] you know dick van dyke and those shows and uh 

326.93 329.10 A: mhm 

328.60 339.74 B: they they just weren't offensive they were darn good shows so uh but now it's a real chore isn't it when you've got young kids i mean you've got to watch it all the time and 

331.86 332.90 A: right 

335.13 336.51 A: mhm it is 

336.96 337.94 A: it is 

339.87 346.60 B: and uh [sigh] it it's too bad because i can imagine what the dinner table conversation must be 

346.24 347.17 A: [laughter] 

346.71 356.04 B: [laughter] with some of these shows if the kids are watching them and they really don't even get it but then they use language that they heard 

350.51 351.72 A: right 

355.79 363.65 A: well that's like i have a friend of mine who has a twelve year old boy and she allows him to watch friends and i was just appalled i was like 

363.66 369.47 A: that isn't a show that i watch but i've seen enough of it and i've heard enough of it 

365.79 367.14 B: yeah 

369.50 382.43 A: and i you know i have several of my thirty seven year old friends that just really enjoy that show and they're like you know you oughta you oughta turn it on and watch it and it's like i just don't i don't find it funny 

375.12 376.14 B: yeah 

382.16 383.10 B: (( mm )) 

382.84 388.55 A: i mean there are probably parts of it that are funny but i just don't find it funny because i can't get past the 

388.70 391.34 A: you know the language and the other stuff in it 

391.23 393.96 B: yeah yeah and yeah 

392.77 406.22 A: and and she allows her twelve year old son to watch to that and i'm just having a fit i'm thinking i wouldn't allow my you know my daughter's seven and she's very old for her age very mature but i would not allow her to watch it 

395.93 397.85 B: no that's bad 

398.22 399.22 B: yeah 

402.23 403.41 B: mhm 

405.89 413.48 B: yeah yeah oh i agree yeah i but you know i guess we all have different standards and and different opinions 

411.59 412.53 A: right 

412.77 414.11 A: right 

413.48 423.64 B: and and i'm sure what i think is in bad taste other there would be some people who would think it's not in bad taste at all that it's just part of the language nowadays 

419.05 420.08 A: mhm 

423.15 430.27 A: right i have that problem with my husband because my husband doesn't necessarily agree he thinks i'm too you know too conservative 

429.52 430.68 B: uh-huh 

430.36 435.83 A: and there have been times i work evenings and i've come home and he's let 'em watch 

436.05 440.82 A: maybe a movie or something that wasn't particularly something that i would allow 'em to watch 

440.45 441.68 B: mhm 

440.93 445.73 A: and they're like well dad let us watch it well dad doesn't have the same 

446.43 452.63 A: you know what i may find offensive he you know he doesn't find anything wrong with it 

449.74 450.63 B: (( mm )) 

452.30 453.82 B: yeah yeah 

453.15 457.64 A: and i'm like you know i told him i said well i said if i'm home you're not watching that 

457.59 458.68 B: uh-huh 

458.45 464.93 B: yeah and ther- there's some things that i may not think are terribly bad if it were just me alone watching 

464.08 465.33 A: mhm 

464.73 478.90 B: but if my you know if i had young kids if my grandkids were in the room then that would be terribly you know wrong so and i think that has a lot to do with what we find acceptable and not acceptable and i think a lot depends on what time the show is on i 

469.45 470.34 A: right 

474.27 475.78 A: (( right mhm )) 

478.77 481.29 B: mean if the i don't think anything that has 

481.52 493.88 B: well i i'm kind of a prude but [laughter] you know bad language and sexual innuendo and everything should be on when the kids are apt to be up i know kids are up at all times but but at least not until nine 

491.76 504.77 A: [laughter] it used to be that way but now it seems like even after eight o'clock you know most of the time it's like after i can remember growing up it's like after nine o'clock then they were you know before nine o'clock it was pretty calm 

496.22 497.37 B: yeah 

500.82 502.03 B: mhm 

503.88 506.10 B: that's family time for sure 

504.76 509.52 A: but then after after nine o'clock it's like pretty much anything went you know 

509.06 510.22 B: yeah 

509.63 515.02 A: like the mary hartman show and some of that stuff i can remember particularly that my mom 

512.11 513.24 B: mhm 

515.11 522.81 A: you know my mom and dad would watch it and then well like if we'd come downstairs they're like this isn't something you need to see you need to go on back upstairs you know 

520.73 521.66 B: yeah 

522.13 523.53 B: mhm 

523.05 532.61 A: and it just but it doesn't seem like they have that now that defined as far as what's considered family time and what's 

530.14 531.16 B: yeah 

533.01 535.64 B: mm i know i i've seen 

533.77 542.76 A: and even like the commercials because i've seen them show like the commercials for some of the sitcoms and even just in the clips on the commercials it's like 

540.45 541.23 B: yeah 

541.89 543.24 B: exactly 

543.24 544.32 A: you know 

543.83 554.37 B: yeah i've seen those as well and uh i'm i'm you know like constantly saying my to my husband my goodness look what they're saying [laughter] you know and uh 

552.17 553.18 A: mhm 

554.52 567.66 B: i i'm glad that there's no little kids in the house watching this and so but as i say again i've seen the promos watched the commercials and i've never seen like a whole one of the shows i we tend to watch i like larry king and 

557.70 558.66 A: right 

567.59 571.26 B: depending on the guest he has you know that sort of thing 

569.25 575.05 A: yeah i'm just not much of a t._v. watcher e._r. is like my i'm an e._r. junkie 

572.25 573.17 B: yeah 

575.17 576.20 B: uh-huh 

575.20 582.58 A: [laughter] i like my e._r. and that's really about it i don't watch the sitcoms i watch the talk shows i enjoy those 

577.46 580.08 B: yeah yeah 

581.98 586.03 B: that's what we like and uh we do watch seinfeld 

586.10 587.27 B: every night 

586.20 590.17 A: now seinfeld but seinfeld wasn't really you know 

589.60 594.86 B: this yeah they're they're pretty good uh they're of course all reruns but there's been a few 

594.72 595.80 A: right 

594.93 599.89 B: that i was well there was one on masturbation one night and i thought ooh
