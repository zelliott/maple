0.38 2.58 B: hi this is kimberley reid 

2.06 3.74 A: hi this is dan 

3.39 4.47 B: how are you 

4.06 5.22 A: (( good how are you )) 

4.92 5.71 B: (( good )) 

5.88 10.56 B: um i guess the topic is the line between humor and bad humor 

7.38 9.19 A: (( [laughter] )) 

10.29 12.78 A: between and and i guess offensive humor 

13.97 16.29 B: okay [laughter] 

14.59 15.47 A: [laughter] 

16.18 18.29 A: so do where do you draw the line 

20.42 27.43 B: it's not always easy because you have to um know the p- it it depends on the person that you're 

27.53 32.00 B: speaking with um really it's based on their values and beliefs 

32.32 34.99 B: they they may find something 

36.93 37.95 B: um 

38.94 41.76 B: as bad or you 

42.09 46.39 B: know something that they don't like in something that you don't find anything wrong with 

45.68 47.04 A: [noise] well uh 

47.11 49.98 A: sorry it's just a very bizarre situation [laughter] um 

50.50 51.87 A: what uh 

52.16 59.66 A: like what specific is there a type of humor that you think you know some people will find offensive that you don't or vice versa 

59.80 61.35 B: (( [laughter] okay um )) 

62.28 65.27 B: an example would be uh humor about religion 

65.29 66.22 A: (( okay )) 

66.08 69.94 B: some people may be very offended by certain 

70.87 74.94 B: items that you say where other people don't think anything of it 

75.27 81.69 A: [noise] what if uh what about sort of self deprecating humor if you are a member of that religion does it become more acceptable 

81.34 82.69 B: i'm sorry what was that 

82.28 92.23 A: like self deprecating humor if you are a member of that religion does it become more acceptable to laugh at jokes about that or to tell jokes about that 

93.49 94.40 B: hm 

94.74 96.22 A: just a question [laughter] 

95.93 96.72 B: yeah 

97.47 98.66 B: yeah that's a 

99.09 100.22 B: i i 

100.43 103.12 B: don't know [laughter] 

101.46 115.69 A: i uh a few years ago i went with a a large group to a comedy club not a very good one and one of sort of the the second rate acts there was doing some pretty tasteless jokes about women and most of the women in the crowd uh 

115.57 121.18 A: actually got up and left and some of them were demanding their money back i mean i've never seen anything like it [laughter] 

120.91 121.86 B: wow 

121.60 126.49 A: yeah so i think i think that was a clear case of something being offensive 

125.88 128.32 B: yeah [laughter] i would say so 

129.63 131.95 B: maybe it needs to change its act [cough] 

132.88 141.42 B: um but that i i think that that some people if you hit on a real sensitive subject um they they obviously don't find it funny 

137.75 138.85 A: mhm 

143.95 145.41 B: um uh i don't know i guess 

146.51 152.40 B: drawing the line is is [mn] i guess you can tell just about anything to offend someone 

151.99 153.60 A: [noise] that's probably true [noise] 

153.20 155.66 B: and just knowing 

155.95 157.53 B: the other person 

157.70 159.44 B: and what they're like 

161.04 164.39 B: really is is how i would draw the line of 

164.78 167.56 B: you know what type of humor they would find tasteless or not 

168.31 172.19 A: well like where are you calling from like what area of the country 

171.80 173.26 B: geor- northwest georgia 

173.23 174.75 A: okay so 

174.78 177.61 A: i mean do you get offended when people tell southern jokes 

177.42 180.16 B: no i don't but i know people who do 

179.59 182.64 A: probably or like jeff foxsworthy and redneck jokes 

182.15 190.28 B: right [laughter] i think he's hysterical [laughter] but i know people who find him offensive 

185.58 186.45 A: [laughter] 

189.97 190.53 A: (( [mn] )) 

190.30 194.68 B: so [mn] again i just think it you know depends on the person [cough] 

195.25 201.33 B: um and on the person who's telling the joke or telling or or or making the statement 

201.18 202.44 A: mhm 

201.75 208.97 B: depending on the the person uh i might find it offensive coming from one person where i wouldn't coming from another 

209.21 211.27 B: 'cause my perception is different 

211.69 213.40 B: from one person to another 

212.91 224.70 A: [mn] so do people who you think are generally okay with those jokes or sorry are generally unhappy with those jokes do they react differently you know when you someone from georgia are you is is it okay for you to tell them but you know i'm a 

224.62 228.51 A: i'm a northerner if i came down into georgia and told them would i get in trouble [laughter] 

228.17 235.73 B: i i think that's true i i think that um a person that was considered a northerner telling a a southern joke 

236.14 244.06 B: to a southerner the southerner would find it offensive and um i think the tr- the the same is true with race 

238.94 240.00 A: yeah 

244.22 245.19 A: yeah 

244.38 253.63 B: certain racial jokes um if you're the same race you you might it might be funny and if you're not the same race it may not be funny 

253.08 254.40 A: (( [laughter] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

253.67 258.55 B: [laughter] so it it again i it just really depends on the person you know 

259.28 262.14 B: making the statement and the person receiving it 

262.16 264.30 B: um i myself 

265.14 280.07 B: try not to tell or or make anything humorous that i personally don't find humorous and knowing the people that i'm speaking with i am cautious to not touch on any subjects that i know they wouldn't find 

280.17 281.60 B: um amusing 

284.15 287.83 A: [noise] sorry i've got people in my office uh giving me a hard time on this 

287.83 288.90 B: (( they are )) 

288.34 289.72 A: [laughter] 

289.36 290.65 B: (( where are you at )) 

290.25 292.18 A: i live in washington d. c. 

292.66 296.44 A: where we have some not very good humor out here [laughter] [noise] 

295.12 298.33 B: oh [laughter] 

300.69 302.46 B: well this is interesting it's 

302.52 304.54 B: a hard topic to talk about really 

303.60 307.02 A: right well i mean i i imagine anything probably uh 

307.16 308.51 A: would be 

308.83 311.78 B: yeah probably [laughter] 

312.18 314.06 A: so what else can we talk about humor 

313.98 315.22 B: humor [sigh] 

314.67 326.92 A: um do you have any comedians and that that you you know enjoy and what kind of humor do they practice i mean i'll give you i i enjoy jerry seinfeld he does a lot of jewish humor which appeals to me 'cause i'm jewish but also has uh 

326.91 334.63 A: somehow managed to appeal to most of america which you know seems a little strange to sort of transcend the cultures i mean is was he popular at all in georgia 

334.00 336.00 B: (( uh mhm oh yeah uh )) 

336.37 338.86 B: i love jerry um we 

339.09 344.80 B: my husband and i watch him quite often and just always found him funny i thought he had you know 

341.34 342.57 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

345.81 353.88 B: good sense of humor jokes that was more about day to day life and that sort of thing not necessarily depicting one 

354.61 355.99 B: area 

356.69 360.31 B: culture religion i didn't find that mhm 

358.38 365.47 A: yeah i mean i i think that's a good example of you know taking sort of a comedy niche and 

365.52 370.68 A: somehow making it appeal to the masses i don't really know exactly how he did it but clearly he was successful with it 

369.91 374.74 B: right right there i i have a lot of of um 

374.78 376.57 B: comedians that i like 

376.82 379.58 B: um there's a lot that i don't like 

379.17 380.06 A: (( like who )) 

379.74 381.37 B: um i'm trying to 

382.92 386.39 B: (( andrew dice clay is that his name )) 

385.85 389.32 A: oh yeah from the he was dirty [laughter] 

388.61 392.40 B: yes very very nasty very nasty do not like him 

392.49 393.57 B: um 

393.50 400.02 A: yeah i i feel like most people would agree that he's offensive even if they liked him i mean [laughter] 

397.70 398.91 B: extremely 

399.68 401.15 B: extremely 

401.62 404.30 B: and then there um 

405.20 406.61 B: howard stern 

406.98 413.84 B: he's not really a comedian but there's a lot of people that like him [laughter] he what 

410.09 412.02 A: he might think he is [laughter] 

413.47 415.24 A: he might think he is [laughter] 

414.62 423.13 B: right well i i my it's funny 'cause my brother thinks he's hysterical and i think he's just awful [laughter] so um 

423.51 425.17 B: i just you know 

426.44 430.64 B: i uh i think that anything that jokes against 

431.61 433.94 B: basic values of your life 

434.09 436.79 B: um i i just find tasteless 

437.33 439.45 A: okay so i mean 

441.14 442.62 A: (( [noise] [sigh] what uh i )) 

442.68 453.38 A: mean have you ever been in the situation where you've had to tell someone you know i don't find that funny or like i told you the story where you know a bunch of people just walked out of this comedy club because the guy was so tasteless 

452.86 456.84 B: mhm uh well it depends i if it was uh one person 

456.99 459.09 B: telling me um 

459.12 461.22 B: i probably just wouldn't laugh 

460.81 461.93 A: mhm 

461.33 475.47 B: i wouldn't want to of- unless it was really bad then i would say look that's you know [laughter] it's really way over the line there but most of the time i would probably just not laugh and and they would get the impression that i did not care for it 

464.91 465.62 A: (( mm )) 

468.27 469.14 A: [laughter] 

475.38 479.28 B: if i had paid to go see someone i would probably get up and leave 

478.87 479.97 A: yeah 

479.37 483.14 B: and but i would i would have had the same reaction probably as the other women 

483.25 487.45 B: in most cases i you know would just walk away from it [cough] 

486.89 496.15 A: yeah i uh several years ago i was working retail somewhere and someone told me a a joke that i thought was racially offensive and while neither 

496.11 509.61 A: the person nor i were a member of that ethnic group like i just was very uncomfortable because you know i was an employee and i was customer's always right sort of mentality yet i didn't really wanna laugh approvingly or anything like that because 

509.43 519.23 A: personally it just didn't make me comfortable yeah i just sort of gave a half smile and and just moved on to a different conversation you know tried to give a a disapproval 

509.47 511.59 B: that's a difficult situation 

516.24 530.22 B: right just kind of yeah letting them know that you you you really didn't find it funny but you know okay fine [laughter] 'cause that can be hard when you're working i work with customers quite a bit and um sometimes they do 

526.81 527.89 A: mhm 

530.36 537.47 B: begin to tell jokes and and and you're right you don't wanna offend them because they're the customer but yet you you don't want them 

534.93 536.26 A: mhm 

537.80 540.21 B: to really feel that you approve of it either 

540.00 544.53 A: right it's i mean what what sort of industry is that 

544.39 545.46 B: oh um 

545.66 550.32 B: actually my customer service has to do with financial um [mn] i._t. systems 

547.86 553.27 A: mhm really and people are telling jokes in that setting doesn't seem like a you know 

551.38 552.62 B: [laughter] 

553.21 555.08 B: finance people right 

553.69 558.39 A: when i go into the the bank or to talk to a financial adviser that's not really what i'm there to talk about but 

557.79 571.45 B: oh actually i i i support work within a corporation the finance for the corporation and i'm speaking to like h._r. and finance managers out in the different locations and a lot of payroll people um that 

564.73 565.70 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

571.49 576.88 B: they're they're not really number cruncher types of people they're more input analysts 

577.26 578.15 B: uh 

578.20 579.68 B: keyboard or 

579.81 582.60 B: key key processors i should say 

581.51 582.84 A: mhm 

582.72 592.61 B: um but yeah the the most of the real number crunchers don't tell too many jokes at all [laughter] they don't find jokes too funny [laughter] 

587.92 588.80 A: (( [laughter] )) 

592.09 598.53 A: yeah are there any like i don't know sitcoms or comedy shows on t._v. that you are loyal to now
