298.23 299.45 B: right 

300.52 301.29 B: (( oh )) 

306.99 312.07 A: unless you're out there working the five fifteen or you have a child working it 

311.99 312.92 B: mm 

313.06 320.55 A: you're not so affected by it but i i believe if our minimum wage was more then the people that are making the higher money 

320.71 323.94 A: would make better money and it wouldn't be so 

324.89 329.53 A: i it doesn't fit with the economy at all the economy is way above 

329.79 332.53 A: the five fifteen an hour yeah 

330.14 332.91 B: yeah you would think right 

332.65 334.04 A: i know here 

333.23 336.91 B: and w- w- and w- why we shouldn't have also like universal healthcare 

337.19 338.76 B: like they do in

342.29 345.60 A: [noise] yeah the countries yeah a lot of 'em have that 

343.22 347.10 B: but you know we're rich enough we got you know 

346.90 349.07 A: but we don't have that 

347.20 349.50 B: well we're not huh 

349.47 356.47 A: we don't have that we're we're the ones that have to dump three hundred a month for a family into health insurance 

356.26 358.47 B: right that's what 

356.88 359.24 A: which other countries don't have to do 

359.09 360.10 B: right 

359.87 362.42 A: and we're supposedly richer than all of 'em so 

361.64 363.94 B: (( yeah we're really supposed to be out there )) 

363.95 365.65 B: (( i just don't you know )) 

365.36 369.73 A: so if you're making five fifteen an hour you sure can't afford health insurance [sigh] 

369.30 370.65 B: (( that's true )) 

371.17 377.34 A: i know my my husband makes a lot more than that and three hundred a month you know 

379.33 387.56 A: [noise] i mean he'd have to be making forty dollars an hour to survive [laughter] with uh three hundred you know if he had to take it on himself you know 

384.01 384.92 B: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

386.75 387.74 B: (( mm [sigh] ))

392.06 392.77 B: (( [laughter] )) 

393.35 405.32 A: i love america but i i think we need to start taking care of our own and see the minimum wage go up and 'cause there it is true in most of the states it is five fifteen and [sigh] 

406.04 410.95 A: um i think oregon is the only exception i haven't heard of any other state 

410.74 411.54 B: (( mm )) 

411.97 414.68 A: maybe alaska but 

414.96 415.83 A: um 

415.01 418.39 B: but they should have it like maybe at least ten dollars an hour 

418.66 422.60 A: yeah or or even if it was seven just some people 

421.41 423.75 B: (( well that's a little better yeah i mean ))

563.53 575.94 A: it's got to be six months in between and yeah and there's some i do every month but it's so simple it's like they don't know that that's why i'm there you know so 

565.99 567.87 B: right you can't right 

575.53 576.64 B: (( oh mm )) 

576.88 579.76 A: but um 'cause they've seen me enough anyway 

579.81 588.72 A: and then i try and even when i'm not doing a shop i try and go to that shop off and on so they see my face and they don't 

589.22 591.66 A: put me like i'm a mystery shopper 

592.41 595.95 A: so i just like a plain old customer passing through [laughter] 

596.27 597.10 A: so 

597.41 599.89 A: a l- lotta reason uh for doing that is
