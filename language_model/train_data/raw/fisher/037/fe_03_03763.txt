0.31 1.52 A: (( hello )) 

1.34 3.94 B: hello this is adriana who's this 

3.64 5.01 A: this is risa 

4.94 6.68 B: hi risa how are you 

6.30 9.07 A: good um i've never done this before have you 

9.16 12.61 B: um i've done it once so it's pretty interesting 

12.42 15.02 A: so do we just sit and talk is that the deal 

15.02 20.29 B: yeah we just sit and talk we talk about if we think the minimum wage is enough 

20.27 24.78 A: um i would have to say no i would say definitely not 

24.87 25.80 A: um 

25.09 29.85 B: oh do you um have you worked in a minimum wage job before 

29.53 38.40 A: i have i haven't done one for a while like not since high school but um i definitely like i feel that there's a a really um 

38.56 51.50 A: there's a difference between the minimum wage and a living wage and i feel that the minimum wage needs to be raised to the level of a living wage for it to actually be sufficient and i think that's like somewhere around like eight dollars seven eight dollars an hour but i'm not positive 

40.14 40.75 B: (( [noise] )) 

51.17 54.21 B: really i think it depends on um 

54.24 55.77 B: on where you live 

55.77 63.30 A: yeah but i think like that's the lowest like across the nation like i live in santa cruz so it would have to be like a lot higher than that for this area 

62.60 68.26 B: oh yeah i live in l._a. so that's that would be similar for me [noise] 

63.59 64.72 A: (( but like i think )) 

67.23 81.46 A: yeah but like in the midwest you know like i'm sure in like wisconsin or something or like montana like seven or eight dollars would be fine but it's like there's all these like jobs that are leav- like a lot of the jobs are leaving the country too like we're becoming just a service sector 

71.20 72.87 B: oh yeah 

81.36 90.17 A: um economy instead of industry and like we like i know so many people that have graduated from college and like are working retail like at banana republic and that 

89.51 91.78 B: oh i know yeah 

90.20 96.89 A: you know and like it that i mean a it sucks that like you had to get a college degree to do that 'cause you definitely don't need one 

96.73 109.45 A: and then like they don't have enough money to pay back their loans like a lot of them that have the- these jobs like their parents paid for college and are are helping them out right now but if like you're relying on that to like support your family and your kids and try and send your kids to college 

107.28 110.89 B: yeah that can't last for forever yeah 

109.55 119.63 A: it can't last even for a year like you can't have medical insurance you can't like have a car you can't send your kids to school you can't like put your kids in like after school activities and things like that 

119.41 132.48 A: and like if you're working like you have to work over forty hours a week if you're making like minimum wage to actually support yourself and then like how are you going to afford to pay for kids to be in after school activities if they can't be put in after school activities then like they have a lot of time on their hands 

132.31 141.75 A: chances are like they gonna have more time to get into trouble like it's just i don't know i feel like it just perpetuates just like this really unfair system and i just don't 

135.75 137.04 B: yeah 

140.79 149.67 B: i've always kinda been kinda like um you know confused that it's one wage for the whole country 'cause like as you know as we've kinda established like 

149.59 161.15 B: it's totally different like new york city versus l._a. versus santa cruz or whatever i kinda thought how would the economy be different if we like had a relative living wage you know like depending on 

155.07 155.83 A: (( mhm mhm i )) 

159.63 160.80 A: yeah 

161.16 164.59 B: what the sliding you know like a sliding scale or whatever 

164.03 171.34 A: mhm yeah i agree i feel like isn't it though like isn't it based off of state like it 

170.36 176.18 B: [noise] oh no there's a federal well yeah they have a state one too like california's is six seventy five 

175.95 176.87 A: okay 

177.12 182.21 B: so yeah i guess that's like slightly better but um actually it's a lot better 

180.50 184.72 A: it's still it's so much more yeah but it's so much more expensive to live out here like 

184.64 196.21 A: housing is more expensive and then like even just like going to get a cup of coff- yeah gas is insane or like getting a cup of coffee or like getting a sandwich like i remember being like where was i i think i was in 

184.67 185.89 B: that's true 

186.89 188.22 B: or gas 

196.55 203.06 A: i was in a part of col- like i used to live boulder and boulder's kind of expensive but like i was in denver and denver's pretty cheap 

202.99 212.04 A: and like i was there like a couple of months ago and like i they pay like i don't know like two thirds of what we do for the same shit you know like 

211.40 218.98 B: i know and also for housing like just your housing is so expensive like what does what does in santa cruz cost 

212.20 213.02 A: (( like mhm )) 

218.49 222.93 A: i actually have a really good deal and it's five sixty a month so 

222.15 224.75 B: oh and is that a studio or what is that 

224.09 236.18 A: no it's actually one bedroom in a three bedroom apartment but like i overlook the ocean so it's pretty nice but like i i mean i would not be able to survive on i would need at least double minimum wage to survive and i'd still be poor you know 

229.66 231.04 B: wow 

236.20 237.30 A: (( like it's just )) 

236.22 238.43 B: yeah what what's your job now 

238.16 240.06 A: i'm a grad student actually 

240.01 245.18 B: oh and so am i i just finishing up grad school yeah [laughter] yeah 

241.26 242.50 A: oh really 

242.61 248.76 A: right on [laughter] is that why you're like i'm gonna do this study [laughter] [laughter] 

246.68 251.98 B: oh yeah my friend just like emailed me it and i'm like okay and i just signed up online 

250.44 257.12 A: me too and i was like cool money like helping someone else out doing their research that's cool what do you study 

257.07 259.82 B: um i'm a singer i'm study music 

259.24 263.22 A: (( oh nice right on i'm a sociologist )) 

260.34 261.61 B: yeah how about you 

263.35 265.31 B: oh wow interesting 

264.80 265.98 A: yeah 

265.54 267.45 B: so this is actually like 

267.26 268.35 A: right up my 

267.53 270.42 B: somewhat related to what you do [laughter] 

269.05 276.82 A: [laughter] it is i have like i don't know just like i mean if you seem to agree with me so like i'm not spouting off but if i was like 

276.71 283.97 A: talking to somebody that had different views i would definitely be pulling all this shit out of my arse but yeah i think it's pretty fucked up but it's just so easy to like 

283.82 296.88 A: sit here from like a perspective of like a you know middle upper class person that's like had an education and like has had opportunity in life and say oh they should be able to get by on that but like you look at the reality of the situation and it sucks and it's like 

296.73 303.15 A: you know not only that it's like they don't even enough money to like feed themselves properly and like educate their kids properly but it's like 

302.94 317.13 A: even beyond that just like i don't know like we're such a materialistic culture and like people want things they wanna buy things they wanna have nice things they wanna be able to go on vacation and like if you make that much money you're not going to be able to do any of those things and that's definitely going to affect like 

317.06 325.87 A: you know you're mental happiness especially because like everything around you in our culture says that you should buy and consume and spend money you know mhm mhm 

325.15 331.10 B: oh i know and especially like if you're if you're in that mindset of like the haves and have nots 

331.13 333.70 B: and like it makes people 

333.70 345.74 B: i don't know like do things like i don't know maybe commit crimes or something i have no idea but it's like it's like yeah i've totally been on the side of like feeling like i have what i need and i've been i've felt like 

345.70 356.67 B: like being told like i need this now and like kind of having to do a double take and like no i don't need it and just i don't know yeah it's it is quite messed up so 

355.61 368.81 A: i hear ya i was watching i remember when like i was like a kid and my parents were always like drugs are bad blah blah blah and i study a lot of stuff with drugs and i don't feel that way but you know like growing up as a kid like my parents always said that and everyone always said that to me and i remember 

368.81 383.10 A: like when i was young i was watching an interview on twenty twenty and it really stuck with me like it's like twelve years later and here i am still talking about it but it was this guy and was he like lived in a ghetto and he like dealt a bunch of drugs and he was just like you know 

383.10 392.00 A: like i feel like all these people and they have nice things and i want nice things too and he's like my mom's on welfare i can't get a job because if i get a real job 

391.77 405.92 A: then like we're gonna be above the welfare line but only like by a couple of hundred dollars so but we won't get any assistance from the government and we need that assistance 'cause i have younger brothers and sisters and he was like the jobs that i work like are like at fucking mcdonalds like the 

405.97 416.50 A: managers are assholes and like he's like but i can like go out on the street and there's a sure market and i can slip some shit and i can make a bunch of money and have some respect and have nice things you know 

416.51 418.50 A: (( and it's like yeah i do it you know )) 

416.96 422.56 B: oh yeah totally especially if there's no options for you it's like yeah i totally i mean 

421.36 436.15 A: yeah it's just like oh okay could work in mcdonalds and wear a hairnet and like get like five bucks an hour in like a shitty work environment or i can go slip some shit on the street like work two hours a day hang out with my friends and goof off the rest of the time and get like the respect of everyone around me you know 

436.19 440.22 A: like it's just like it just leads to things like that you know 

436.23 437.29 B: yeah 

440.38 445.56 A: i don't know there just needs to people just need to like sit up and like take more notice of the links between like 

445.58 457.48 A: you know like if people are unhappy and if people don't have what they feel that they wanna have or should have then like things are they're things are gonna get fucked up sooner or later somewhere down the line 'cause like they're gonna act out in some way you know 

457.05 458.99 B: yeah i know i know 

457.39 464.03 A: just like you would and like just like i would if i was in their position you know like we're just all humans we're just trying to like look out for ourselves mhm 

462.77 469.14 B: i think yeah i think when people get desperate then they do like crazy stuff you know it's just like that's just how people are 

468.65 483.18 A: yeah well it's like the if you don't have very much to lose then like you know like that i don't know that just sometimes stops people from doing ba- things that are harmful to themselves 'cause you think no i have too much to lose but if you don't then it's like what okay what's gonna stop you you know 

483.01 485.82 B: [noise] so what are you working now are you a t._a. or [noise] 

485.57 490.32 A: um i'm actually i got a fellowship this quarter but yeah usually i've been a t._a. 

490.35 492.01 A: so yeah 

491.20 494.64 B: oh that's good good for you so do you have to have a job or 

494.75 506.29 A: well i don't know it's just like i can really i mean i could take out a shit load of loans but like my department also really emphasizes t._a.s and it's like they pay for my tuition and they give me money each month to survive so that's 

506.34 509.96 A: it's kinda nice but it's also a pain in the arse so i don't know 

509.21 510.43 B: why 

510.07 522.07 A: i don't know why just because well it's just like there's so much work like 'cause just you know grad courses are a lot more work and then i'm doing my own research and then it's like the professors at my university like they all they do is deliver the lecture 

522.04 534.40 A: [lipsmack] but they assign like a lot of papers and stuff and we grade all the papers and we run the sections and we actually teach them and talk to the students and so we end up working like twenty hours a week sometimes more and 

534.35 537.89 A: it's just you know it just can be like a lot sometimes 

537.58 545.49 B: yeah and especially when you teach 'cause you have to be there for your students like if they're like can you help me out it's kinda hard to be like no [laughter] 

538.00 538.81 A: so 

543.68 552.15 A: yeah and it's also just like i mean it's also like you need to know what you're talking about and like you don't necessarily like you haven't assigned the material the professor has 

551.97 560.01 A: so like you need to know it inside and out 'cause like y- you're supposed to be the authority on it you know what i mean and so it's like you have to be really prepared and 

559.78 569.33 A: you know then there's always those students that are just like you know they don't really wanna do any work but they wanna get an a you know and so you're like battling with them and like half the time i'm just like you know what 

566.15 567.75 B: right right right 

569.10 578.08 A: this is cool but like i don't wanna be a professor and like this is taking up a lot of my time like i'm not focussing on my work at all like i didn't come here to be a t._a. you know 

578.25 583.75 B: so do you wanna be a a sociologist like are there sociologists that aren't professors out there 

580.77 581.40 A: (( um )) 

583.30 588.05 A: yeah the- there's more and more these days but like i wanna work in public policy 

588.29 592.30 A: and stuff like that so i could do it i could do it in that way but 

588.33 589.51 B: oh okay 

592.46 596.49 A: yeah what do you do do you t._a. or like what what year are you 

592.77 593.92 B: cool 

595.13 599.95 B: um i am a t._a. but i'm i'm graduating actually with a masters this semester
