14.73 15.50 A: (( yup )) 

18.64 21.02 A: [noise] minimum wage five fifteen an hour 

20.50 32.48 B: five fifteen an hour i don't know being from um a big city and um i also i go to school down in washington it just doesn't seem possible for someone to be able to survive on five fifteen an hour 

27.52 29.01 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

32.42 37.09 A: [noise] i well you know i'm in indi- indiana [noise] we're not classed as a 

37.29 43.42 A: you know the biggest we don't have any of the biggest cities in the world or anything [noise] here but still five fifteen an hour is 

43.93 48.14 A: you know what's that [noise] what's that work out to be like ten thousand dollars a year [noise] 

47.32 50.47 B: something like that like right below welfare yeah 

49.74 52.19 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah that's ah )) 

52.86 59.31 A: you know that's a a thousand dollars a month you can't [noise] you can't get an apartment and pay your bills and stuff on a thousand dollars a month no 

59.24 63.31 B: definitely not public transportation even even walking 

63.51 64.86 A: (( oh yeah )) 

63.55 64.33 B: um 

64.41 72.82 B: so i guess the government's argument then is is what that it's mostly part time workers or kids who are getting the jobs but that doesn't always hold water huh 

72.93 75.03 A: [noise] yeah um 

75.16 82.61 A: yeah you see [noise] plenty well especially with the the way the economy's tanked for the last ah what three years four years 

81.50 82.45 B: yup 

83.25 88.60 A: ah yeah [laughter] you see out of work dotcom employees at mcdonalds 

89.09 93.97 A: you you know the economy's bad when you get ah when you go to mcdonalds and they don't mess your order up 

94.09 98.95 B: [laughter] [laughter] because there's some m._i._t. grad behind the counter [laughter] 

94.18 95.15 A: that means that 

95.39 96.78 A: that means that they got 

98.35 103.54 A: yeah they got competent people at mcdonalds that's bad because they should be at a better job 

100.64 101.55 B: [laughter] 

103.48 105.66 B: yes that's true yeah 

105.60 120.57 B: i've been doing i've been reading i mean i'm just in in college now i'm a senior at georgetown but i've been reading um i mean there was just those recent you know times magazine articles and all the papers about all those the horror stories of people um you know high execs in the dotcom 

121.01 122.95 B: business who are just now 

123.66 125.37 B: going for minimum wage 

125.72 126.68 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

125.86 129.74 B: you can't raise a family on minimum wage on minimum wage either 

129.69 134.94 A: i don't see how you could ah at least well not not on minimum wage by itself i don't know 

131.57 132.27 B: (( mm mm )) 

135.59 140.22 A: government assistance on top of that you know then really what's the point 

139.69 140.63 B: mhm 

140.85 141.65 A: [laughter] 

141.27 148.54 B: that's true but if you even had two members of your family on minimum doing minimum wage jobs it'll take you over welfare and then you're 

148.78 152.19 B: you're out of luck anyway still only going on twenty thousand 

151.64 157.75 A: [noise] [noise] yeah yeah that that's true and if you're if you're up of that then you're off of um the 

152.38 153.94 B: however that is 

157.88 164.68 A: off of health care i mean and ah no no minimum wage job paying five fifteen an hour's gonna provide you with decent health care 

161.93 163.31 B: that's right 

164.26 165.46 B: exactly 

165.86 168.11 B: exactly so um 

168.51 175.91 B: i guess then i guess the problem is that um in order to raise minimum wage there's just we can't have these tax cuts that are coming 

173.39 174.14 A: (( [noise] )) 

176.13 183.78 B: or you have to raise taxes for the rest or something 'cause that money can't just come out of thin air especially when we're in a deficit 

183.86 185.00 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] hang on )) 

185.67 187.38 A: yeah um 

187.77 191.64 A: [noise] ah w- isn't there an argument that says something like ah [noise] 

191.75 199.15 A: if you lower taxes on businesses then the businesses will be able to pay [noise] employees more [noise] [noise] then 

197.79 200.91 B: (( that's weird like you know like trickle down )) 

200.90 202.33 A: (( [noise] yeah that )) 

200.93 204.32 B: economics yeah i'd believe that if they're yeah if they're 

204.53 211.59 B: you know small places it's just hard because eventually you know the first people to usually get the the pay increases [laughter] are definitely 

211.50 224.97 B: up there the execs and yeah and it kind of seems that unless you know um unless the government raises keeps on raising minimum wage it just i don't think you know those types of you know labor intensive jobs will 

211.69 214.24 A: (( yup the executives yeah )) 

225.43 227.45 B: will get the pay increase on their own 

227.53 229.16 A: (( yeah [noise] of )) 

228.06 228.99 B: (( i don't know )) 

229.65 230.84 B: (( and it's kind of a )) 

229.77 235.14 A: course i get ah the the other side of the argument though is that um people that 

235.18 239.45 A: get good at their jobs get rewarded with higher paying jobs [noise] 

239.28 240.43 B: that's true 

241.47 255.79 B: that's true i guess the other side of the argument at that see it's funny you can just keep on going back and forth with this one that um the people who'd generally get promoted or have a chance at those high paying jobs are generally people with better education and then you get into the um 

255.73 258.41 B: issue of whether or not um 

258.48 265.92 B: [lipsmack] people in certain areas or urban areas or you know are more privileged and can get to that education have the opportunities 

266.04 267.16 B: and the rest 

267.86 271.22 A: [noise] mhm hang on well that and also families with money 

271.56 276.76 A: have bec- you know with money because they have better paying jobs [noise] um 

276.88 279.33 A: get more education because they can afford it 

279.29 280.90 B: exactly 

279.58 282.82 A: which in turn gets them better paying jobs [noise] while the 

283.32 287.50 A: you know the opposite's true the other way if you can't afford to send your kids to college then 

287.67 291.21 A: they can't get as high paying a jobs and so they can't send their kids to college 

291.06 299.59 B: yeah exactly yeah and then interesting there how you brought up health care as well i guess you know without you know nationwide health care 

297.72 298.32 A: [noise] 

299.55 306.81 B: um that in itself is like taking you know it could take an enormous amount of money just to get regular checkups for your children 

306.90 313.94 B: um out of your paycheck that enorm- you know someone who is making a higher wage doesn't even have to worry about it cause it's covered 

306.93 308.84 A: mhm 

314.44 320.47 A: yeah yeah yeah that's true um being a like i said earlier i'm self employed 

320.51 323.45 A: so i [noise] i can carry 

323.52 328.22 A: you know very expensive insurance and get ten dollar prescriptions [noise] 

328.23 329.83 A: or you know i can carry 

330.28 335.23 A: really crappy insurance that you know if i get hit by a truck i'm not completely [noise] you know 

334.30 335.27 B: (( then you're in )) 

335.28 337.37 A: not completely cleaned out 

337.91 339.21 A: (( but ah )) 

338.34 341.06 B: (( the dock yeah and you never know [laughter] )) 

341.39 342.44 A: (( yeah i know )) 

341.59 342.22 B: (( i )) 

342.50 343.94 B: (( guess that mm )) 

347.11 347.93 A: (( yeah )) 

348.38 352.08 A: i've two ah [noise] two kids two little girls and ah 

351.99 353.37 B: oh really 

352.14 355.92 A: we have them yeah a six year old and a two year old 

353.42 354.22 B: oh 

355.87 356.94 B: mhm 

356.17 359.52 A: and ah we keep them covered but [noise] for 

359.88 362.48 A: ah for me and for my wife we 

363.05 363.88 A: ah 

364.30 366.69 A: i think right now we're not even covered right now 

366.99 369.87 B: really because ah to protect yeah i 

367.49 368.30 A: so 

370.02 371.60 A: it's too expensive 

372.41 379.61 B: suppose i don't know my father's been in and out of out of jobs and my mom she actually works for a um you know she works through the 

379.58 389.07 B: state college system so she's always covered somewhat but with my dad but there's certain things that the state doesn't cover like you know dental and besides basic health 

383.08 384.13 A: (( [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

389.05 397.78 B: whereas when he was in a job he had everything and all of a sudden something hits that you didn't plan for and it just the bills are just amazing 

397.79 398.63 A: mhm 

397.93 399.97 B: it's just oh my goodness 

400.12 401.53 A: yeah um both of m-

444.40 445.46 B: and 

445.54 448.45 B: i mean and minimum wages seem to be tied to 

448.51 452.34 B: so many other problems because when the people you know the 

452.70 453.72 B: um 

453.73 466.96 B: the economic the economic um that is it's getting minimum wage might it's also you know research has shown that it's also you know a- b- babies are more likely to be born out of wedlock or you know
