1.99 2.87 A: hi how are 

3.15 4.91 A: hi todd i'm jennifer 

4.88 5.96 B: how are you 

5.88 7.00 A: pretty good 

7.26 12.17 A: um let's see i'm just about to pull up in front of my house here so the ah 

7.38 8.37 B: good 

11.10 13.55 B: okay i'm walking so it's okay 

13.62 14.68 A: [laughter] 

13.74 17.89 B: so what we're supposed to talk about is the minimum wage raise to five fifteen 

16.47 17.89 A: minimum wage 

18.08 19.09 B: is that enough 

18.13 19.47 A: and is it enough 

19.40 21.63 B: hell no it's not enough 

21.37 22.63 A: [laughter] 

22.43 25.34 B: that's crazy how can you live on that 

24.97 33.44 A: yeah i mean i i sort of feel like well i guess it's enough but it depends on where you live [laughter] you know so it's 

30.82 31.81 B: right 

32.72 39.50 B: yeah i mean ah you better be living with your mom and dad [laughter] you know 

33.68 35.55 A: in a way it would be nice if 

37.13 44.75 A: yeah that's right [laughter] well all right yeah when i was living with my mom and dad man i still i had to pay for all kinds of stuff still 

44.71 48.62 B: yeah exactly e- exactly i mean ah i 

45.80 46.73 A: so 

48.80 63.50 B: mean hell i make more than that but the amount i make is like too low you know i mean ah i probably make about probably making it's like eleven dollars an hour and another couple of little commissions a little job i do and that's like that should be minimum wage you know what i mean 

54.71 55.43 A: (( mm )) 

60.83 61.45 A: (( mm )) 

63.45 66.40 A: i know it's hard it's really hard to live on 

66.53 70.14 A: so actually at the moment i'm in graduate school so 

66.64 68.14 B: yeah 

69.37 70.20 B: okay 

70.16 74.80 A: ah it's an interesting financial situation because i you know used to have a real job and 

75.06 81.71 A: you know made perfectly good money and so on and then decided to go back to school so it's been a real adjustment trying to 

81.90 87.60 A: get used to a lower wage when in fact you know what i make is still far above the minimum wage 

87.65 89.45 B: right 

87.83 91.97 A: ah but it's it's hard to do [laughter] it's very hard to do 

90.26 95.10 B: right did you work did you work for a while before you went back to grad school 

94.68 106.47 A: i did yeah about five years and you know had a proper job and was in management and all the stuff and and it was great but i sort of didn't really like the culture the you know 

105.97 107.48 B: sure or 

107.16 107.84 A: (( yeah )) 

108.00 110.86 B: right so the money wasn't the most important thing 

108.81 109.50 A: (( ah )) 

110.61 115.64 A: exactly so i you know wanted to go and pursue other things um but [laughter] 

115.52 118.60 B: were you making more than five dollars and fifteen cents an hour 

115.74 116.67 A: (( yeah i was [noise] )) 

118.69 122.33 B: [laughter] were you making more than five fifteen an hour 

118.92 119.93 A: pardon me 

122.29 134.63 A: yes i was and and ev- but even as a grad student now i'm making more than that if you average it all out for the work that i do i make way more than that but i still am just on a shoestring all the time 

122.67 124.55 B: (( oh yeah yeah )) 

128.75 129.54 B: right 

134.63 135.64 B: right 

134.94 146.53 A: because you know i work probably twenty hours a week or more so if you were to you know work that out with minimum wage that's you know over ten dollars an hour technically if it were being paid you know 

143.89 145.05 B: right 

146.63 149.19 A: equivalent of minimum wage amounts per year and 

146.88 147.96 B: right 

149.56 152.52 A: and that's still not enough you know 

152.41 153.26 B: right 

152.65 155.19 A: to live on you can't you can't get by on 

155.26 157.26 A: ten bucks an hour twenty hours a week 

155.28 169.19 B: i don't know how anybody i mean i i work like ah forty five hours a week sometimes fifty like i said i make like eleven bucks and like a small commission and i sell cellphones ah when i sell them but ah like i'm paying jack to pay jack 

163.86 164.52 A: (( mhm )) 

169.32 170.88 A: yeah 

169.38 177.02 B: you know i mean i mean i gotta pay rent and i gotta pay bills and i don't know how the hell anybody could do it on five fifteen an hour 

177.18 178.47 A: (( i know )) 

178.15 182.05 B: yeah yeah yeah 

178.78 185.44 A: but where yeah i wonder if where the where any extra money would come from to 

186.01 190.49 A: m- make it so that a higher minimum wage would be possible for employers 

190.05 198.41 B: that's true that's true because it might get [noise] for them and plus you're talking usually smaller businesses you know that would do the ah five fifteen an hour 

198.35 208.16 B: that's not gonna be like yeah it's not gonna be somebody that's doing some business it's gonna be someone that's doing more mom and pop or hiring kids or whatever that kind of thing 

198.60 199.77 A: right 

207.15 207.86 A: huh 

208.18 214.24 A: yeah i bet a call between two small business owners and they'd be like yeah the minimum wage is great [laughter] i 

213.38 216.68 B: right oh yeah right 

214.72 217.19 A: fact it's a little high [laughter] 

216.71 219.06 B: (( yeah can we make it three fifteen )) 

219.09 221.44 B: yeah right that's it [noise] 

220.54 229.58 A: [laughter] do you know i remember my first job was working as you know a hostess at some restaurant or something when i was sixteen or fifteen or i don't know 

221.53 222.25 B: but 

229.56 230.49 B: right 

229.89 238.17 A: and at that time i don't i don't know what the minimum wage was but they had said that i would make four fifty an hour 

238.40 245.98 A: and then the day that i started well i got my first paycheck after being there for a few weeks and they had only paid me four twenty five an hour 

238.42 240.07 B: right 

245.80 259.16 A: so of course i went and complained and said well you know what you said was this or that and they actually gave me lip and said you know well but for this kind of work this is all we're paying and so here's my first work experience ever 

245.94 247.34 B: (( [noise] right )) 

259.07 267.32 A: and i'm dealing people who weren't sort of holding up to their word and things like that and and i think about that and think goodness you know did it really 

259.14 260.30 B: right 

263.03 264.86 B: (( right )) 

267.27 278.70 A: how could it really matter to them that twenty five cents an hour for me who was a part time person working you know fifteen hours a week or something like that didn't get any benefits 

278.52 279.44 B: right 

278.88 281.64 A: you know how could that have been such a crisis 

281.70 282.55 B: yeah 

282.02 282.59 A: (( [noise] )) 

282.49 288.08 B: i actually i yeah it's funny 'cause i remember back ah when i was a lot younger and i worked a summer in construction 

287.94 290.70 B: and i was like a helper and that was like ah 

290.49 298.08 B: man- when they ah they're building a home and they drop off a whole truck load full of wood it's you're job to move it over ten feet 'cause it wasn't in the right spot 

297.73 299.21 A: (( right [laughter] [laughter] )) 

297.87 308.03 B: but i was like but i i was getting like five fifteen or whatever the hell the ah making five bucks an hour and i remember getting pay checks each week 'cause it would always rain like one day 

302.05 302.78 A: (( yeah ah )) 

307.99 314.93 B: and they never worked weekends with this company for some reason i'd get like a hundred and thirty five dollar paychecks like after taxes you know 

313.68 315.05 A: wow 

314.95 327.37 B: yeah and i and i was you know pretty young and living at home like going to college and stuff so it wasn't as important but get a hundred and thirty five dollar paycheck now come on you know you can spend that in a couple days you know 

322.58 323.84 A: yeah 

327.38 328.46 A: uh-huh 

328.01 331.82 B: yeah so it would be crazy that ah 

330.56 331.74 A: wow 

331.89 336.42 B: so yeah yeah [noise] so where are you a graduate student at 

336.75 339.25 A: um i'm at university of washington 

339.53 340.98 B: washington 

340.73 341.71 A: mhm 

341.07 343.96 B: so so what are you're down in d._c. 

344.16 345.71 A: um no in seattle 

346.13 349.67 B: in seattle wow so this study's like all over the country okay 

347.25 348.14 A: (( yeah )) 

349.32 351.48 A: yeah yeah it's everywhere 

350.30 351.17 B: okay 

351.58 355.33 B: all right that's like the two i'm in philly i'm in philly 

352.15 353.13 A: where are you 

354.80 357.34 A: oh okay oh i've been there 

357.30 359.31 B: yeah it's a little town little 

357.86 358.93 A: you know 

358.98 363.14 A: what you could not live in manny on c- on five fifteen an hour [laughter] 

362.99 370.56 B: no you couldn't you couldn't that's funny a buddy of mine lives in manny [noise] i'm over there once in a while but yeah that would be tough 

363.81 365.30 A: [laughter] 

367.27 368.88 A: oh yeah 

369.51 371.42 A: i almost moved there once 

371.60 383.01 B: did you yeah well it's like a little trendy area it's a yeah all right that's the twenty percent we talked about that that's the twenty percent we talked about i live right around south street as a matter of fact 

372.41 373.96 A: yeah 

374.02 375.09 A: (( cute place )) 

376.29 379.04 A: yeah but i liked the south of the area 

382.72 383.59 A: oh you do 

383.52 390.56 B: yeah yeah all right that's the twenty percent of the time we've talked too much about something else right we got to go back to topic 

384.12 385.06 A: cool 

385.26 387.06 A: that's you can't live on that 

390.20 396.79 A: oh right okay so minimum wage it would also be really hard to live on in south street so i think if you live or work in 

391.16 392.23 B: (( [noise] )) 

393.18 394.83 B: [laughter] 

396.88 400.23 A: the philadelphia metro area then the minimum wage should be higher [laughter] 

398.69 399.64 B: right 

400.24 404.25 B: right yeah exactly or or in seattle it should be higher 

403.57 408.76 A: in seattle absolutely or san francisco holy moly definitely have to be higher [noise] 

406.45 407.22 B: (( yeah i )) 

407.25 410.75 B: mean the cost of living's got to be kinda high in seattle right 

410.91 423.79 A: it is ah it's interesting because our university um the graduate student employees we are sort of in this constant process of trying to you know work out a unionization strategy or something because 

423.71 428.22 A: um our wages rank quite low compared to our peer institutions 

427.95 428.71 B: right 

428.35 436.74 A: and when you factor in the cost of living in some of these cities it's really quite startling um you know what we get paid in comparison to other 

436.83 440.37 A: grad students who live in cities where the cost of living is lower 

440.40 441.15 B: right 

440.65 441.58 A: so 

441.71 442.56 A: (( you know )) 

442.99 446.14 A: but anyway not that minimum wage really affects me but 

444.10 444.95 B: yeah 

446.59 448.01 A: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

447.67 461.37 B: yeah yeah i mean i cut my pay ah i used to have a ah i used to work making corporate sales and all that and a company car and like making good money and then i got burned out after one job after another and i decided to kind of pursue like some acting and some stuff like that that i do 

461.05 462.12 A: oh fun 

461.73 472.84 B: and ah so i took big pay cut big pay cut i mean like where i was i used to make like you know sixty five grand and a company car now it's like twenty five grand and no company car you know 

465.13 465.94 A: yeah 

471.65 473.74 A: (( right right [laughter] i )) 

473.20 475.77 B: yeah but 

473.88 476.92 A: can't believe the car [laughter] mhm 

476.07 479.84 B: yeah but it but it's ah yeah at least a little more gratifying but but 

480.00 482.26 B: that's not minimum wage i make you know 

482.44 484.68 B: so that that would be real rough 

484.05 484.83 A: right 

484.93 485.57 B: but 

485.07 493.96 A: so here's the thing so you have this other pursuit that is really interesting to you and you make some money at it and that's all great but say you wanted to supplement your 

493.96 501.18 A: that income by working at some nice small business in the evenings or something is it really worth it for five fifteen an hour 

498.68 499.75 B: right 

501.25 503.84 B: right no that's true 

502.66 511.83 A: you know it hardly seems worth the effort you go work for a four hour night shift every other night and end up kind of exhausting yourself because you're double timing 

511.83 522.91 B: i wouldn't do it actually ah that's a good question i i wouldn't do it because it's like well if i only make five fifty an hour i'd rather be spending some time with some friends or doing a an acting job at a theatre that doesn't pay 

513.44 514.93 A: e- exactly 

523.12 525.62 B: i'd rather do that 'cause that would be more satisfying 

523.26 523.85 A: (( mm )) 

525.71 530.83 A: right yeah the minimum wage just isn't enough to really sort of motivate you to go 

526.61 528.29 B: (( yeah )) 

531.02 533.16 A: take that job someplace 

532.72 537.03 B: right i mean there's enough jobs i can get at ten eleven bucks an hour 

537.10 545.51 B: you know what i mean th- that probably would kinda stink you know but i'd rather have a job that stinks for eleven bucks an hour than 

537.24 537.88 A: (( mm )) 

545.37 548.10 A: [noise] instead of one that stinks for five fifteen [laughter] 

545.54 546.91 B: (( five fifteen an hour )) 

547.84 552.64 B: right i mean i- if i can have a job that stinks i'll take the higher pay one thank you you know 

552.76 554.48 A: [laughter] yeah 

553.91 560.60 B: yeah and i don't know i guess i would think the five fifteen one would be people that might not have the wherewithal to ah you know find a at 

560.65 563.13 B: least the eight buck an hour job you know what i mean and it's 

563.12 568.25 A: mhm lets see but here's something that factors in though if you have someone who 

568.40 572.97 A: you know for whatever reason that five fifteen an hour job is appealing to them then 

571.80 572.75 B: (( gotta be right )) 

573.20 577.32 A: they may be in a situation where they don't have a car or adequate transportation 

577.43 582.09 A: so then you have to pay for that too you know to get somewhere or to 

577.50 578.35 B: true 

582.11 592.51 A: you know get a car or whatever i mean in addition to a place to live and everything else and i just can't even imagine working that out on that wage without 

592.60 598.75 A: just working an insane number of hours and then what if you know what if you're a parent and you have kids you know [laughter] 

594.98 595.96 B: that's true 

598.68 599.70 B: right 

599.32 599.95 A: or some
