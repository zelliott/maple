398.28 399.21 B: (( yeah well )) 

399.54 412.10 B: yeah i well taste is a subjective it's hard to be offended espec- if you even if you go see someone and you don't know what they're about and it's not your taste and you feel like it's over the top out of line then you leave it alone 

412.15 413.39 A: yeah yeah
