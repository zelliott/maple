1.95 3.25 A: [noise] hello 

3.27 4.18 B: hi 

3.92 4.82 A: hi 

5.36 7.21 B: (( my name is maria )) 

7.19 9.08 A: my name is juanita 

9.17 10.43 B: okay 

11.24 12.99 B: where are you from juanita 

13.04 14.73 A: i live in texas 

14.54 16.91 B: oh most of us live in texas 

16.82 18.03 A: where are you from 

18.08 20.50 B: i live in harlington texas 

20.18 23.78 A: oh really i'm in pearland 

22.88 24.11 B: (( oh okay )) 

23.84 25.87 A: near um clear lake 

26.16 29.06 B: oh okay no i'm in south texas 

28.77 31.26 A: oh so that's pretty far 

31.15 32.76 B: (( yes in the valley )) 

32.78 33.84 A: yes 

34.16 40.31 B: the reason i was asking is because you know how certain states have different wages you know 

39.97 40.99 A: yes 

40.66 44.31 B: i mean i know the minimum wage is the same for everyone right 

44.23 46.07 A: um as far as i know 

46.05 54.35 B: yeah but like you know california has better wages of course the standard of living is much more expensive 

52.51 53.50 A: oh 

53.76 58.29 A: yes i i don't know though i've never been out of texas before 

58.06 59.39 B: oh okay 

58.30 64.86 A: so i don't know i have no idea but i i have heard that the cost of living is more 

59.91 60.72 B: mhm 

64.88 67.61 B: it's way more expensive [noise] [noise] [noise] 

67.87 70.92 A: i don't think ma- minimum wage is enough 

70.91 74.52 B: no i don't think so either and you know um it's 

74.83 78.34 B: they should at least bump it to maybe seven dollars 

78.00 84.64 A: yes some people have to work two jobs because they make minimum wage and can't get by on what they make 

84.48 86.03 B: exactly yes 

86.51 90.39 A: and i know like down in the valley there's a lot of people that make 

90.41 99.47 A: less than minimum wage immigrant workers and i don't think that's fair either they can't live on that [mn] 

93.38 94.42 B: mhm 

96.78 97.51 B: (( no )) 

98.61 101.95 B: no and and that's one of the reasons why 

102.06 107.65 B: if you're not making enough money you're getting money from the government for food stamps and 

107.57 108.70 A: right 

108.07 112.21 B: [mn] all these free programs so that doesn't help the government at all 

111.80 112.88 A: right 

113.20 114.21 B: mhm 

113.56 115.94 A: so i think they should make it more 

116.82 118.12 B: yeah 

117.53 120.99 A: then people will be able to live a better standard of life 

121.94 123.43 B: that is true yes 

124.42 125.65 B: um 

126.02 133.01 B: of course living out here in the valley is not that expensive either but still you know the minimum wage doesn't help at all 

132.74 133.77 A: (( [noise] yes )) 

135.21 143.79 A: [noise] we live in pearland and um it's a a little [noise] a little bit richer area in pearland but we're not rich 

143.65 144.89 B: (( [noise] no )) 

143.83 146.23 A: we live in a we live in a trailer 

146.39 147.17 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

146.97 152.01 A: and i make more than minimum wage but it's still hard to get by with two children 

153.40 154.54 B: (( you d- [noise] )) 

153.56 157.73 A: so if i only made minimum wage i would have to work another job 

160.24 169.22 B: well i make [sigh] i don't make minimum wage i make more than that but um but i you know i i've always got a second job in order to 

160.44 161.19 A: and 

169.35 171.13 B: and i'm i'm single 

171.03 172.15 A: yes 

171.52 177.91 B: so you know in order to be able to pay my bills and live comfortably you know for i don't have a 

177.97 182.84 B: a financial district or something you know i've always had a second job

349.26 359.67 B: [mn] let me see on um minimum wage well here in the valley first of all you don't if you don't have an education there's no way you're gonna get something higher than

364.21 369.63 A: oh everybody needs education everybody if you wanna make more than minimum wage [noise]

370.99 371.82 B: but i've 

372.88 378.85 B: the only problem is up here in the valley there's not that many jobs also and you know skilled jobs 

376.59 377.70 A: i know 

378.43 381.74 A: my grandmother used to live in the valley in magellan 

381.80 384.42 A: near brownsville i think it's near brownsville

384.12 386.15 B: yeah it's an hour away from [noise] here

394.13 398.02 B: yeah it's but right now it's kind of hot you know but 

399.29 400.19 B: (( yeah )) 

399.56 403.50 A: [noise] the people are very nice too everybody is nice [noise] 

401.66 402.63 B: mhm 

403.30 404.99 B: (( very friendly people um )) 

404.60 405.61 A: yes 

407.22 413.42 A: it does get hot though it gets hot here too gets very humid here 'cause we live near um galveston 

413.89 419.97 A: so the water makes it like very sticky all the time hot and humid 

414.24 415.11 B: okay 

421.18 422.30 B: yeah 

421.26 423.79 A: but yes it does get hot in texas 

424.52 426.09 B: (( very very hot )) 

426.71 430.47 A: yeah we have w- a big air conditioning bill every summer 

430.62 431.55 B: mhm 

431.45 436.75 A: it's a good thing i make more than minimum wage or i wouldn't be able to run the air conditioner [laughter] 

437.99 445.78 A: wouldn't be able to pay the light bill the light bill's very expensive everything is so expensive i don't see how people can make a make a living on minimum wage 

445.93 449.18 B: [laughter] [noise] [sigh] [noise] no um you know like when 

449.30 452.20 B: that takes away most of your money by the way 

452.05 462.92 A: and then when you have children in school the school they want you to buy everything paper pens tissues clothes everything books you have to pay for everything 

458.99 459.80 B: yeah 

462.93 468.49 A: i remember when i went to school when i was little my mom sent me with a pencil and a lunch and said bye bye 

463.08 463.97 B: mhm 

468.87 471.01 A: now we have to buy them everything 

469.00 470.15 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

471.81 475.26 A: and i just don't see how people can do that on minimum wage 

476.34 491.30 A: especially if you were like single with two children or more or even one child it's gotta be hard very hard and then the children suffer too because they must do without certain things 

482.50 483.53 B: yeah 

484.90 485.70 B: mhm 

491.96 494.31 A: because the parent cannot afford it 

494.57 495.59 B: yeah 

498.11 500.27 B: [noise] [sigh] um well 

500.60 503.97 B: in fact what was the last time that they did a minimum wage increase 

504.12 505.61 B: (( i don't even remember )) 

505.07 508.30 A: i don't remember either it's been a little while 

508.44 509.67 B: yeah but i 

508.51 513.57 A: i think they need to raise it again because grocery prices went up a lot 

510.09 510.85 B: [noise] 

512.90 519.55 B: well you know not only that but like if w- remember if oil goes up everything goes up the price of gas 

517.88 520.14 A: oh yes yes 

520.01 526.39 B: so but they need to raise it at least you know they they raise it what a quarter every time or something like that 

526.12 529.20 A: i'm not really sure how much they raise it i 

529.65 535.60 A: i don't even know how much minimum wage is is it five five fifty 

534.52 539.89 B: i think it's five fifty or f- yeah five fifteen i don't remember it's 

538.77 541.36 A: oh yeah that's not very much 

540.12 543.03 B: been a long time since i had minimum wage 

543.15 544.55 A: yes me too 

544.60 545.57 A: me too 

544.67 545.50 B: (( mm )) 

546.74 547.84 B: (( so um )) 

548.12 553.13 B: they need to raise it at least to i i think that you start at like seven dollars 

552.51 554.48 A: yes at least 

554.58 557.47 B: and then you know work from there up 

558.99 567.63 A: [noise] or maybe it should go like depending on which state you live in because every state like you said earlier california costs more to live in california 

567.56 568.48 B: uh-huh 

568.28 575.23 A: so maybe people in california should get more minimum wage than people who live somewhere where it's very cheap to live 

575.06 576.10 B: yeah 

576.88 578.01 A: (( i don't know )) 

577.40 578.06 B: i 

578.27 580.21 B: (( i think so too but [sigh] )) 

584.31 587.77 A: do you have any um family that works for minimum wage 

587.90 593.71 B: [noise] no most of my family works at least at seven or eight dollars an hour 

593.25 596.91 A: yeah i don't know anybody either that does minimum wage 

596.57 598.42 B: (( mhm yeah )) 

597.07 599.95 A: i would never work for minimum wage i've never
