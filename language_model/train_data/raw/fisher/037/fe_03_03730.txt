149.25 150.36 B: yeah 

150.53 151.63 A: well 

150.56 152.23 B: so what you make around

152.90 154.45 B: dollars a week 

154.69 155.51 B: (( [laughter] )) 

155.82 156.40 A: (( [cough] )) 

155.99 157.87 B: and just just under 

158.08 160.22 A: [lipsmack] yeah i mean you know 

159.50 160.20 B: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

160.91 162.96 A: incredible so um 

162.39 166.98 B: that is why uh [laughter] this country just doesn't care about 

167.01 168.16 B: the poor 

168.79 169.59 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

169.87 175.28 A: [sigh] well i i've i kinda feel like the span between 

175.63 178.13 A: w- what is the middle class 

178.09 179.07 B: mhm 

178.73 184.36 A: and the wealthy but that break is getting wider and wider in the sense of um 

184.38 187.20 A: more and more people are becoming 

187.32 188.35 A: poor 

188.72 190.85 A: and the rich are becoming richer 

191.55 192.52 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

191.79 192.50 B: yeah 

192.90 201.08 A: and also i don't know in in like in your area where you live notice the growth in homelessness 

201.50 209.90 B: [noise] i i've only been here not even a year so i can't say that i'm in a position to observe [mn] such change but 

209.97 211.10 B: (( i don't know )) 

211.68 212.98 B: (( uh [mn] )) 

213.31 218.62 A: well the reason is 'cause i keep noticing ol- more and more families and women 

218.67 223.16 A: and especially older people that are just on social security [cough] 

223.43 225.95 A: because they can't afford the rents here 

226.37 228.13 B: oh down in san diego 

227.80 239.86 A: yeah they can't afford the rents because they have to have well i don't know how it is in san francisco but i know here if they're coming in with minimum wage or they're on social security which is like 

240.56 251.41 A: less than minimum wage [laughter] uh you know you figure you have to put a deposit down on a place and a w- a one bedroom goes for 

242.35 243.27 B: yeah 

252.13 257.72 A: anywhere it depends on where you live between you know six hundred and fifty on up 

257.75 258.64 B: yeah 

258.27 262.56 A: and then we're not even covering food or utilities or transportation 

262.82 263.66 B: yeah 

263.08 267.95 A: man on minimum wage you're gonna do that i don't think so 

265.48 266.48 B: yeah 

267.89 269.39 B: well the problem i mean [mn] 

269.40 273.46 B: one problem with having a really low minimum wage is that um 

273.49 279.27 B: [lipsmack] that doesn't really induce people to work you know if you're only gonna be making 

278.87 280.09 A: absolutely 

279.72 282.77 B: whatever five fifteen an hour uh 

281.53 283.83 A: i gotcha i i agree with that 

282.79 283.58 B: (( then )) 

283.84 287.73 B: you might as well stay at home and a lotta people 

288.11 291.26 B: um you know if they're on say welfare 

291.30 292.13 B: then 

292.34 302.09 B: they might even be getting more than they would be for getting if they got a minimum wage paying job so uh you know if the government had an um a policy 

302.30 303.23 B: or 

303.28 303.88 B: (( [sigh] )) 

304.32 310.92 B: if they believed that people should be working then they should have a higher minimum wage to 

311.02 313.10 B: induce people o- into the labor 

312.31 320.20 A: mm yeah and and an income if the minimum wage really were at five dollars and something odd cents as was quoted 

320.69 321.73 A: um 

321.81 324.14 A: i'm sorry no one could survive on that 

324.24 325.22 B: no 

324.93 326.30 A: yeah it's uh 

326.04 326.81 B: (( i guess )) 

326.98 328.30 A: (( and [mn] )) 

328.79 331.57 B: (( i don't [laughter] it's disgusting )) 

329.95 336.02 A: [cough] well you know too that we we have to consider look at all the billions of dollars we've spent on the war 

336.23 338.58 A: you know we have to pay that 

339.12 340.12 B: right 

339.97 341.65 A: we have to pay that 

342.25 345.79 A: and can you imagine someone who's living on 

346.03 351.64 A: a minimum wage income and you know five something an hour 

352.77 353.56 B: (( yeah )) 

353.10 354.00 A: (( [sigh] )) 

354.57 355.39 A: how

355.68 356.62 A: yeah 

361.70 371.12 B: i don't have m- money but i could you know i have a college degree i could go out and get a job that pays pretty well it's my choice to be like this 

371.40 377.19 A: mhm [cough] right and i understand that too because you know i i too have uh 

377.80 379.28 A: degrees and 

379.80 381.23 A: (( and um )) 

381.37 382.48 A: now i've 

383.74 386.68 A: [sigh] well you know 

387.11 388.86 A: what it depends on what you do 

388.96 389.82 B: (( [laughter] )) 

389.12 390.48 A: i'm still 

390.79 392.81 A: i didn't make all that much money 

393.63 394.41 B: so 

393.77 395.14 A: for what i did 

395.47 396.26 A: so

407.03 407.71 A: (( [cough] )) 

407.73 414.92 A: the most i ever earned course i will admit now i didn't work for the state or the county or for the city 

415.11 417.63 A: i worked in really for no profit 

417.97 418.79 B: right 

418.15 421.58 A: [lipsmack] and the most i ever earned was twenty eight five 

422.95 423.87 B: [noise] wow 

423.88 425.46 A: yeah that's nothing 

425.32 427.57 B: well at least you were doing a good thing

441.22 442.13 B: (( right i don't )) 

441.45 442.59 A: but um 

442.82 443.85 A: uh 

444.95 452.39 A: the and it was a struggle on that income you're talking about w- i'm i'm assuming you make more than five dollars and something cents an hour 

452.33 453.63 B: know that i do 

453.32 454.20 A: yeah 

454.11 458.88 B: oh well i could right now i don't make anything that's because i'm in school but um 

456.70 458.33 A: oh okay well the 

458.97 461.53 A: the point is you can't survive on that anyhow 

459.11 459.87 B: (( yes )) 

461.44 462.24 B: (( no )) 

462.14 462.90 A: yeah

465.26 466.43 A: i uh 

465.39 466.41 B: (( and )) 

467.08 469.81 A: this was an odd question i will have to admit 

469.56 472.62 B: [sigh] [laughter] well i don't know uh it it's 

471.53 483.55 A: but you know what in a way it's interesting though because it's gotten us to think about it and talk about it and look how you know we feel about how it affects us in in other situations too 

478.72 479.59 B: yeah 

483.88 484.86 B: yeah 

484.29 486.43 A: so that's okay it gets us thinking 

486.55 491.97 B: yeah i don't think they really care what the topic is it's just to see how people um who've never met 

486.85 487.43 A: (( mhm )) 

492.34 495.33 B: interact with one another over the phone [laughter] 

495.68 500.06 B: so we could probably talk about anything else if we wanted to 

499.64 502.44 A: (( yeah so this is this is c- um )) 

500.47 501.06 B: (( um )) 

502.46 509.28 A: yeah this is interesting [laughter] kind of enjoying this in a sense you know 'cause 

510.40 510.98 A: (( um )) 

512.64 517.24 A: it's interesting to get another person's opinion or to listen to what uh 

517.30 521.58 A: th- their ideas or what they're struggling with and going through 

521.72 522.64 B: yeah 

522.83 524.90 A: [lipsmack] you know becau- yeah 

523.15 523.95 B: well 

524.92 529.17 B: well i remember it when i was taking it was the labor economics course in college and 

529.22 531.63 B: our professor asked the class 

531.94 532.92 B: uh 

533.14 536.53 B: if they if we knew what the minimum wage was and 

536.94 543.47 B: people actually said people didn't know exactly but what people said was lower than 

543.84 546.26 B: what the minimum wage was at the time 

545.98 546.85 A: (( uh-huh )) 

546.38 549.61 B: [noise] so that was kind of interesting maybe feel 

549.70 554.34 B: that it is really low [laughter] in fact i mean when when you told me it's six seventy five 

554.40 555.39 B: um 

555.41 557.44 B: (( i i found that too kinda high )) 

558.11 559.14 B: (( and i was )) 

558.20 559.47 A: oh really 

559.21 564.53 B: yeah that's not so bad [laughter] maybe is that just california or is it the federal 

560.04 560.90 A: yeah 

563.77 565.38 A: [cough] no that's federal 

565.37 566.16 B: (( hm oh )) 

565.76 570.77 A: i believe that's federal the things are posted um 

572.69 578.93 A: [lipsmack] in your place of business and everything else when you go to places they should have the posters set up 

578.00 578.58 B: (( [noise] )) 

578.94 585.39 A: showing you know that because it's one of the things fed say you have out there where the employees can see it 

579.48 580.24 B: yeah 

585.45 587.07 B: (( oh yeah i )) 

586.01 587.26 A: (( and um )) 

587.32 588.03 A: (( [cough] )) 

588.34 589.44 A: so 

589.55 599.89 B: mean that's not so ba- i mean i guess if you're a you know a high school student when i was in high school i worked uh for minimum wage it was four fifty and i i thought it was great you know i washed dishes in a restaurant and i
