0.49 5.14 B: hello i am kevin zimmerman from provo utah 

5.29 9.13 A: hi i'm jodie from washington state 

8.57 9.87 B: [lipsmack] hi jodie 

9.57 10.67 A: (( how are you )) 

10.41 11.88 B: i'm fine thank you 

11.60 12.57 A: good 

12.91 14.92 A: so what do you think about the minimum wage 

15.23 20.75 B: the okay the idea that it should be increased to what five ten or something 

19.29 20.07 A: five 

20.37 22.39 A: five fifteen i think 

21.77 25.13 B: i didn't realize it [laughter] was still so low actually 

24.68 28.87 A: well actually in washington state it's seven twenty five i believe 

28.38 31.17 B: okay is it different for each state then 

31.25 37.53 A: um yeah i think the federal government has it at you know certain and then that each state can make it their own 

31.74 33.29 B: (( i think it )) 

37.28 38.25 B: okay 

38.53 44.82 B: well i i grew up in arizona which is a little bit of an economically depressed state and so i think it's 

45.17 49.32 B: i don't know w- what it is now but [noise] [lipsmack] i um 

50.16 58.78 B: i think it's good that each state can have you know can set it's own minimum wage because i mean living expenses really are different [noise] from state to state 

58.38 59.46 A: right 

59.18 60.16 B: um 

60.34 64.63 B: i think five whatever five fifty even is really low though 

64.42 66.27 A: yes i think that is too low 

66.38 80.45 A: but here i think that the seven what twenty five an hour is maybe a little too high at least where i am at because it's a agricultural community and it's it's hard for the farmers to you know pay that much an hour 

75.51 76.44 B: uh-huh 

80.18 81.25 B: uh-huh 

81.44 83.01 A: so i don't know 

82.04 84.54 B: do you are you on a farm 

84.10 85.12 A: yes i am 

84.89 87.00 B: okay what do you raise there 

86.92 92.32 A: um alfalfa and potatoes and corn and just a variety 

90.76 91.68 B: okay 

92.10 98.86 B: do you find yourself wanting to like hire out people but you don't want to pay them the seven twenty five an hour 

97.48 102.93 A: right actually yeah we we have to hire out our children which we can pay a little less [laughter] 

102.23 104.20 B: well that's true huh 

103.15 104.53 A: yeah 

104.54 109.24 A: so yeah it it is really hard to you know be able to afford the minimum wage here 

109.68 113.23 B: well that's that's interesting from like a an employers point of view 

113.63 120.31 B: um 'cause i've never you know employed anyone but i had worked for ah carl's junior 

120.34 122.33 B: do you have those there in washington 

121.90 124.03 A: uh-huh yeah 

122.56 126.17 B: okay so you know like my first job was ah 

126.35 136.21 B: working for carl's junior and as a you know living at home i guess as a teenager it was enough because you know it allowed me to pay for gas and stuff 

135.79 137.18 A: right 

136.22 138.17 B: for my car but um 

138.56 141.73 B: i think if you have a family especially it'd be really hard 

142.52 148.74 A: yeah i can't imagine being even two parents out there working with a couple of kids making five fifteen an hour 

143.06 144.42 B: to live on it 

148.37 150.08 B: yeah 

149.32 151.57 A: how could you make it 

150.45 157.60 B: i don't know [laughter] but i mean that i- it's definitely for like un- unskilled labor 

157.14 158.21 A: yes 

157.82 158.79 B: um 

159.69 165.13 B: and in a lot of ways i think it's almost a form um o- of enslavement you know 

165.50 179.57 B: i don't know i- if that's a [noise] a big statement or whatever but [lipsmack] i i think if someone you know has to you know make the rent and things and they don't have other skills it's a little bit hard for them to go to school 

174.72 176.03 A: right 

179.73 181.72 B: and things like that 

181.15 183.64 A: right right i see what you mean 

183.91 186.50 A: but ah yeah i guess it it 

186.59 194.06 A: it shows you that you should go to college and [laughter] you know and so you can you know make a good wage that it's too late 

192.20 200.71 B: that's true i mean i'm grateful that i had those jobs when i was younger so that 'cause i [laughter] i'm in the masters program now at the university 

200.87 202.63 B: here in utah and it's 

203.29 206.42 B: ah even now i'm making a lot [noise] better than 

206.50 209.61 B: than what i did so i mean ah 

209.61 210.84 A: yeah 

209.77 213.75 B: it's nice to grow older and get more skills and make more money 

211.36 212.19 A: (( [noise] )) 

213.14 216.97 A: right yeah i mean i guess everyone has to start somewhere 

216.63 218.33 B: yeah 

217.28 221.46 A: i mean for a for a high school student making that much money is is okay 

221.37 222.97 B: yeah 

221.85 222.97 A: but for a 

223.02 226.85 A: older person i don't know maybe they should do a graduated kind of a thing 

227.60 229.44 A: um depending on your age you know 

229.26 230.85 B: (( yup )) 

230.40 231.20 A: so 

232.34 235.30 B: so what else can we say about minimum wage 

232.53 234.42 A: so what part [laughter] 

234.85 242.38 A: [laughter] ah let's see i'm not really sure [laughter] i don't really give it much thought 

242.74 245.40 A: [lipsmack] ah so what part of utah are you from 

245.29 247.63 B: i'm from provo utah 

246.80 247.65 A: (( provo )) 

247.82 249.94 B: i've lived here for a couple of years 

250.23 252.70 B: um [noise] and it's 

252.99 258.58 B: like the the market here is so saturated with really qualified people because it's a university town 

258.57 259.47 A: uh-huh 

258.98 260.11 B: that um 

260.99 266.80 B: i mean there are some minimum wage jobs but it's mostly the the immigrants [noise] that come over from mexico 

266.58 267.72 A: right 

267.08 271.57 B: and i guess for them [cough] i mean it's 

271.69 273.84 B: it's a better living than 

273.96 275.52 B: or a better you know 

275.55 277.66 B: money than they had when they were in 

277.87 281.77 B: in mexico but still the cost of living here is higher so 

281.66 286.01 A: but i think they get around you know by living together and sharing their money and 

286.04 290.95 A: yeah we have lots of immigrants here also and and you know with the farm 

291.44 295.48 A: and they can make it on the minimum wage [lipsmack] 

294.86 302.02 B: so is it's illegal isn't it for these farmers m- mostly in california and things like that with ah 

302.03 308.21 B: what is it called the i guess to to hire migrant workers you know the ones that travel 

307.84 312.91 A: if they're illegal ah you know if they're not in the country legally then it is you can't hire them 

310.70 311.70 B: uh-huh 

312.92 314.87 A: they have to have a green card 

313.06 314.00 B: okay 

314.25 316.62 B: there are a lot of farms that do though 

316.13 318.72 A: oh yes and 

316.88 318.39 B: i just wonder how they 

318.93 322.91 A: there's just not enough i._n._s. to you know check 'em all 

322.44 324.01 B: m- to enforce it 

323.51 325.54 A: yeah yeah so 

325.22 329.19 B: you haven't considered that as an option have you up there with your farm 

328.80 336.02 A: no we haven't but there are a lot farmers that do you know to get around the minimum wage you know because you wouldn't have to pay 'em 

329.47 331.08 B: i guess if you have your kids 

332.15 333.08 B: uh-huh 

336.27 337.41 A: as much 

337.18 338.12 B: uh-huh 

337.96 339.30 A: so yeah 

338.36 340.30 B: how many kids do you have then 

340.16 341.10 A: five 

340.90 343.86 B: five and are they all of age that they can help you 

344.12 352.52 A: no we have two that are are one's four and one's two but the other's i have a sixteen and a two thirteen year olds so yeah they all work 

348.55 349.41 B: (( oh )) 

352.46 353.39 B: okay 

353.89 354.63 A: (( so )) 

355.15 362.52 A: and we pay probably right around the the not the state minimum wage but the five fifteen an hour we give them that so 

360.73 361.87 B: uh-huh 

363.75 364.58 A: you know 

363.78 370.08 B: is it is it really an hourly thing though for them or is it do you just give them you know car insurance or 

370.67 378.63 A: well i- yeah we don't just we don't actually give them an hourly thing where we taxes out and such but um it works out to about that much an hour 

371.46 373.64 B: buy them clothes when they need 'em 

378.32 379.29 B: uh-huh 

379.61 380.48 A: so 

380.50 381.31 A: you know 

380.53 384.84 B: i see would would they work for you if you didn't pay them [laughter] 

383.97 385.01 A: oh yes 

385.40 386.95 A: yeah they would 

387.17 391.30 A: i i'm thinking i'm hoping [laughter] yeah 

388.78 394.26 B: yeah you hope well it's good to give 'em some money to help them learn how to manage it i guess 

394.05 401.66 A: yeah and then they want things you know that then they can go out and buy it it themselves and yeah so we're hoping to 

398.44 399.95 B: yeah 

400.56 403.01 B: at least learn the value of work hm 

402.40 405.66 A: exactly exactly so 

406.47 407.55 A: (( um [lipsmack] ))

435.38 438.22 A: oh oh wow well that's 

437.43 448.15 B: but and she's willing to do it because you know it's helping him out and he's willing to pay her because it helps us out but still it's not like a lot of money but that's fine

498.14 499.99 A: (( yeah )) 

500.56 501.43 A: oh 

501.52 503.87 A: no sometimes it just takes a little while 

503.53 505.28 B: yeah 

505.39 508.99 A: (( ah i have you know five so [laughter] )) 

508.33 514.50 B: i mean the funny thing about teaching is that even though we're paid right now about twenty five dollars an hour like ah 

514.56 520.39 B: that's for ah the time that we're in the classroom there's actually a lot of time that we put in 

517.47 518.35 A: uh-huh 

520.63 527.96 B: ah preparing for class and then grading papers and things like that so i just wonder sometimes [laughter] if it works out to minimum wage 

528.25 535.55 A: yeah you need to break it down and see what it it does work out to it probably would be much less 

528.30 530.36 B: 'cause teachers don't really 

532.22 534.31 B: mhm 

536.43 539.56 A: i know that when we break down our income you know 

536.46 537.32 B: 'cause we 

540.02 543.47 A: i'm sure it's less than minimum wage [laughter] 

542.84 547.82 B: well probably if you live on the farm and you're you're probably putting in a lot of hours that you don't even 

547.68 551.86 A: right right we do but i- it's really the lifestyle that we're going for 

548.78 550.31 B: i don't know 

552.96 556.68 B: yeah you just wanted like a country sort of lifestyle 

552.98 553.72 A: (( you know )) 

556.45 561.07 A: right right yeah it's just a nice way to raise our children we feel 

560.91 566.16 B: that good so you decided that did you both come from a city or something and 

564.93 572.50 A: ah no my husband actually did come from a a farming community and i came from a um military background 

572.15 573.95 B: oh yeah 

572.80 575.87 A: mhm and moved around a lot so 

575.93 581.19 A: i wanted to raise my children you know where they didn't have to move and change schools and you know 

581.60 582.98 A: all of that 

582.57 585.12 B: so what's the what city are you in then
