0.00 5.37 A: (( hi my name is uh marina and i guess we're gonna talk about minimum wage )) 

4.66 11.96 B: hi my name's rhonda [sigh] um [cough] i'm up in canada so uh minimum wage up here is different where are you calling from 

11.89 13.13 A: oh l._a. 

13.10 14.43 B: oh yeah okay 

14.08 20.84 A: from all the way [laughter] like half almost half like half a co- like i'm really far away from you actually [noise] 

15.10 16.27 B: [laughter] 

19.93 29.77 B: yeah you are yeah um so i don't really know too much about how far the minimum wage would get you uh in l._a. so why don't you tell me about that 

29.30 31.17 A: okay um 

31.31 38.43 A: i think in california it's different because in california the minimum wage is six seventy five an hour 

38.46 41.79 A: but the federal minimum wage is only five fifteen 

41.87 51.35 A: but the california law is above the federal law so everybody makes at least six seventy five as long as you you know like you're like a legal worker or something 

51.00 52.84 B: oh i see okay 

52.25 61.86 A: so here it's slightly different but i um come from illinois and there the minimum wage is five fifteen and there's a lot of people that actually work for five fifteen 

61.57 63.64 B: yeah and can they get by on that mhm 

63.42 73.82 A: i don't think so because even if they work like um you know like forty hours a week they're gonna bring home around two hundred maybe two fifteen dollars two hundred and fifteen dollars 

74.22 78.58 A: and uh no i don't think they can get by there's no way 

78.23 82.66 B: yeah like are are rents really high or is it you know food costs or everything 

81.99 86.64 A: no i mean it it it's everything i mean if you have eight hundred dollars a month i mean 

87.08 92.02 A: [mn] i i don't think you can rent any place even if you're sharing it for less than three hundred a month 

91.61 93.32 B: mm i see yeah 

92.71 105.96 A: so no i don't think anybody can get by i think the way they do it is because it's probably you know c- like uh maybe uh the son is working and maybe the wife is working and then the husband has a better job 

105.71 106.51 B: (( mm )) 

105.99 113.43 A: so there's like more incomes in the family in the household and then also a lot of 'em get federal aid on top of that 

109.47 110.59 B: (( yeah i guess that )) 

113.03 114.75 B: oh i see yeah mhm yeah 

114.02 118.31 A: so i think that's the only because there's no way somebody can get by with 

118.67 120.40 A: i mean i have um 

120.61 129.93 A: i work part time because i'm a student so i have probably around five hundred a month and i have a hard time getting by with that uh five hundred a week 

129.74 131.05 B: oh i see yeah 

130.32 135.24 A: and i have a hard time getting by with five hundred a week so i can't imagine anybody 

133.07 133.98 B: yeah 

135.12 144.26 B: yeah well well here i think most people that work for minimum wage are students um with you know either with no experience or you know they're living at home 

144.21 151.42 B: um the minimum wage in canada isn't set nationally it's set provincially um 

151.46 157.20 B: [cough] so uh i don't know cana- canada has provinces rather than states like you have 

156.50 157.53 A: uh-huh 

157.30 162.32 B: [cough] excuse me every every province sets their own minimum wage so it's different uh 

161.54 163.61 A: but how much is it kind of like 

163.08 176.31 B: well in alberta here where i am it's um i believe it's eight fifty uh fi- okay five fifteen american would be approximately seven fifty canadian 

175.87 177.33 A: (( [noise] okay )) 

176.95 181.87 B: so 'cause the canadian dollar is worth less it's about seventy one cents 

182.09 183.31 A: oh okay 

182.52 184.40 B: your to your uh your dollar 

183.97 194.25 A: but i think maybe the people that work for minimum wage it's it's mainly um immigrants like first generation immigrants uh mainly from mexico 

187.16 188.18 B: mhm 

194.13 195.64 B: oh i see yeah 

194.93 196.31 A: or um 

196.85 203.21 A: uh or i think um yeah even maybe like you know like high school students or something 

202.67 209.30 B: yeah that's the case here it's mostly students that ha- that don't have any prior work experience so it's pretty like fast 

207.53 209.43 A: yes that's i think w- 

209.36 211.53 B: fast food kind of jobs 

210.90 217.81 A: exactly but even here if you work at like starbucks so if you work at like blockbusters or something 

217.31 218.55 B: mhm 

217.87 223.18 A: like even there you they don't make like seven dollars an hour so 

222.82 224.26 B: really wow 

224.34 234.22 A: yeah i think that really like straight minimum wage it i don't know hardly like maybe in i don't even think factory workers make that little 

234.99 236.09 B: yeah so 

235.23 237.32 A: but then there uh go ahead 

236.74 242.01 B: so i w- i'm just wondering why they uh they raised it to five fifteen you know if that's 

241.00 243.84 A: it was four seventy five before that 

243.16 247.21 B: yeah uh uh but like if that if five fifteen is still inadequate like 

247.22 254.84 B: w- what thinking [laughter] you know but and if nobody's really paying minimum wage because that's another thing i know that uh 

247.39 249.06 A: yes i know 

254.81 258.94 B: in the the largest major city near where i am 

258.41 259.50 A: mhm 

258.78 270.31 B: they have a lot of problems uh getting people to work in restaurants because you know the wages aren't that good so there's always always help wanted signs at just about every restaurant 

270.17 274.99 B: except the real high end places um [lipsmack] so so they 

275.21 278.21 B: they can't really pay pay too much 

278.23 287.51 B: in in the way of wages to their staff because uh they're not high end restaurants and they uh they just can't afford to so they're not being able to attract 

287.57 298.86 B: uh a lot of workers with what they're paying you know so it's just kind of a a big circle there they can't can't attract anybody 'cause they're not paying much but they can't pay much because they're not making that much so 

290.82 291.87 A: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

298.85 299.99 A: oh 

299.26 300.62 B: so it's kinda hard 

300.73 304.41 B: [cough] excuse me i'm choking here [cough] excuse me [sigh] 

302.95 303.89 A: oh 

304.35 307.01 A: yeah i i think that mainly um 

307.27 313.60 A: yeah mainly um immigrants uh like with no really experience or they can't even speak english 

313.61 314.83 B: mm i see 

313.91 319.26 A: work for that in chicago it was different i think in chica- california's better in chicago 

319.13 329.37 A: it was more common that uh like all the the big uh grocery stores and mainly you know all the cashiers jobs they paid like minimum wage 

328.81 329.78 B: mhm 

329.50 337.18 A: 'cause it seemed to be easier for them in chicago to to find uh mm you know workers but here in california it's different 

336.79 339.96 B: yeah mhm another thing might be that uh [sigh] [lipsmack] 

340.01 341.31 B: if uh 

341.51 345.23 B: if the minimum wage was quite set quite high 

344.97 346.02 A: mhm 

345.36 354.80 B: then perhaps companies would look to other countries like l- let's say they were let just for an example a t. a place that makes t. shirts 

354.77 368.34 B: okay so if um [lipsmack] if the minimum wage was set very high then that company might think okay well i'm not going to use american workers to make t. shirts because because i have to pay them ten dollars an hour minimum wage so i'm going to go to 

355.21 356.25 A: mhm 

363.96 365.11 A: (( mm )) 

365.83 366.78 A: (( yeah )) 

368.22 379.24 B: mexico or taiwan or or some other country where the labor is a lot less expensive so so perhaps the minimum wage is set low for that reason i don't know it's yeah 

374.03 375.41 A: (( exactly )) 

378.38 381.16 A: yeah probably that's probably a reason too 

380.38 382.94 B: that yeah that could be [laughter] 

382.22 392.19 A: and then what i also know though which is kind of like a bad story that i know like for example uh downtown l._a. they have a lot of like factories 

392.45 400.33 A: and uh they have a lot of like industry like industry yeah like um textile industry and lot of stuff like that 

398.58 399.50 B: mhm 

399.94 400.91 B: mhm 

400.30 409.96 A: in the in these factories they sometimes they're called sweatshops where people that don't have work papers work but for less than minimum wage 

407.15 408.65 B: oh okay yeah 

409.41 416.00 B: right yeah and they feel that they have to because they don't have have any other choice because who else is gonna hire them right 

415.91 417.48 A: yes so 

416.38 418.49 B: yeah i've heard of that yeah 

417.87 425.01 A: yeah i heard about that i never thought you know i never believed that this was actually happening but uh uh uh it is so 

426.01 427.11 A: (( but um )) 

426.26 437.76 B: yeah i'm i'm not sure what the answer is because you think logically that the minimum wage should be set to a level where someone making minimum wage can live comfortably 

437.77 442.20 B: um you know not not having to take federal aid 

442.07 443.31 A: yeah 

442.73 455.22 B: you know that that just makes sense because you don't want people to be uh on welfare or or other kind of aid you want people to be self sufficient so on one hand why wouldn't you set the minimum wage to something 

448.73 449.94 A: yes 

451.01 452.01 A: uh-huh 

455.31 461.71 B: that's more reasonable that that uh you know would enable people to actually survive 

461.83 462.98 B: comfortably 

462.66 463.77 A: mhm 

463.11 465.42 B: it makes sense but uh obviously 

464.59 469.24 A: because i think usually these jobs also don't have any benefits 

469.45 475.54 A: i don't think that minimum wages jobs you know include insurance like and stuff like no i don't think so 

469.53 470.36 B: right 

473.60 474.61 B: yeah 

474.98 479.66 B: that's a good point yeah i'm i'm not sure um how how that works 

479.75 488.43 B: um and also as far as restaurants go i don't know if a lot of people factor in the tips that uh servers make 

488.92 497.63 B: you know they they would uh i know a lot of restaurants would pay pay the minimum wage but the the servers are actually making more than that if you factor 

496.63 498.87 A: yeah that's what i know 'cause um 

498.78 499.64 A: (( um )) 

499.47 501.20 A: uh i was um 

500.98 512.68 A: uh in my last year in high school i was working in the summer as a waitress and i actually i don't even know in chicago they only paid you like three dollars an hour for that kind of job which was nothing you know 

504.86 505.66 B: (( everything mhm )) 

510.73 511.80 B: really 

512.46 520.71 A: but you know with tips i i don't know i was working for like six hours and i made like a hundred and fifty dollars so that was really good actually for me at this time 

520.29 521.40 B: mhm 

521.09 530.83 A: so i think that um [lipsmack] that uh people that actually um are waiters um make more because they make tips on top of their salary 

530.48 531.91 B: right yeah 

531.28 537.42 A: yeah but i think um you know like people that work at like mcdonald's or stuff like that i don't think they get tips 

536.77 538.35 B: no i don't think they do 

538.31 543.07 A: so all they have pretty much is their check so for them it's kind of like 

540.91 541.89 B: right 

543.38 544.81 A: hard 

544.10 553.04 B: mhm yeah and to set a national minimum wage doesn't seem right because the stand- the the cost of living in different cities is different so if they set 

550.47 551.58 A: yes 

551.93 552.94 A: (( yeah )) 

552.87 565.76 B: they set the minimum wage maybe five fifteen in some cities is fine you could go rent a one bedroom apartment and feed yourself fine but in another city five fifteen would get you you know a cardboard box under the bridge 

559.72 560.87 A: mhm 

565.71 569.47 A: (( yeah exactly 'cause um i was in the north for four months )) 

565.78 567.00 B: [laughter] so 

569.08 570.05 B: mhm 

569.49 575.74 A: and in new york i mean if if you you know like for me i thought you know like i could find like a share 

575.88 590.12 A: um in new york for maybe like four or five hundred a month easily you know 'cause i figured that was good money and no way i mean it's just so expensive in new york i mean people that make like sixty thousand a year will have to have roommates in new york 

584.12 585.27 B: really 

589.51 591.30 B: [lipsmack] oh my gosh 

590.50 595.29 A: y- y- you know like this is actually a good job sixty thousand a year that's okay 

594.99 596.43 B: oh yeah [laughter] 

595.64 599.95 A: [laughter] and and yeah and they all have to have roommates because it's it's just so
