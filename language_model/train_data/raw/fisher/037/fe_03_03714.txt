42.37 55.44 B: oh of cour- i mean you have to work i mean i actually have some friends in that position and it seems like a lot of people are working two and three if they can find two or three jobs you know working minimum wage and can you know are living with roommates and can barely support themselves 

50.11 51.23 A: right 

54.89 55.68 A: mhm

55.79 56.95 A: right 

60.58 62.58 B: jobs are just disappearing 

62.24 69.02 A: yeah no and the ones that have the minimum wage those are the ones that are busting their butts [laughter] you know to serve us to serve other people 

66.24 67.49 B: exactly 

68.98 74.72 B: and it's amazing like uh what i've found is that a i mean it's i'm in college right now it seems like 

74.85 76.75 B: far [laughter] it's becoming 

76.98 84.56 B: you need a masters degree because everybody with a bachelors degree doesn't have a job and everybody that's has a bachelors degree is taking the high schools jobs you 

79.79 81.24 A: mhm 

83.98 84.91 A: right 

84.58 88.18 B: know jobs that usually went to high school kids for summers you know it's a it 

86.74 96.65 A: yeah well i have friends that went to college you know four years college even more that that and they're working in fast food restaurants or you know minimum wage paying jobs and 

95.44 105.96 B: and it it's not you can't i know here you can't you can't even you cannot survive on minimum wage it's not possible i mean if you the pay you can't live in manhattan that's 

101.69 102.41 A: no 

105.83 113.46 B: definitely i mean is it [laughter] rent is like fifteen hundred dollars a month for a studio you know like six hundred square feet

113.19 114.45 A: (( yeah i )) 

113.57 115.13 B: nine hundred square feet 

114.63 125.10 A: [mn] i lived in um on long island um i moved here two year back the homes louisiana two years ago and um i y- you know i used to say how do people survive when you go y- you know 

124.95 126.03 B: you can't 

125.67 135.72 A: and i had friends had friends there and i mean like you said living in little basement apartments [laughter] you know and they were sharing it with people you know because they couldn't afford it and they were w- you know 

131.12 132.46 B: exactly 

135.67 140.99 A: working really good jobs and still couldn't afford it so i can just imagine people that make minimum wage 

141.42 147.09 B: no i agree and the worst part is it's y- you can't get past i mean to get a minimum wage job 

147.21 158.72 B: you have to have usually a high school diploma or you know y- be in that area but past that you need you have to have a resume you have to have previous experience which you can't get so it becomes a cycle it seems 

149.09 149.80 A: right 

156.06 157.74 A: mhm 

157.78 158.93 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

158.77 172.56 B: and unfortunately like you're stuck at youre stuck at a certain point and i mean there's no way around that unless you get lucky and it's it's a such a shame i mean i mean uh luckily you know i'm in a relatively good position i know but 

164.58 165.94 A: (( right [noise] )) 

172.47 180.83 A: yeah i'm self employed and i don't [laughter] it's not even worth it for me to go and i mean i went to para legal school for two years and i have a degree for tha 

180.95 184.91 A: and um i mean i just i'm i'm staying at home i babysit right now

206.45 207.68 A: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

211.06 214.71 B: there's something to having a living wage like i really believe that there 

215.18 219.45 B: people should be able to like they shouldn't have to work seventy and eighty hours a week 

219.17 219.95 A: no 

219.55 223.14 B: two jobs and to be able to just survive [laughter] 

222.90 223.49 A: (( [laughter] ))

260.79 263.66 A: hm yeah i've done like the clinical studies 

263.42 269.43 B: yeah it's it's so difficult to carry a conversation about minimum wage [laughter] for ten minutes though [laughter]

285.76 294.45 B: yeah i think it's more i don't even think it's about the topics at hand i really believe it's more about like they're they're studying interaction i think between two people that don't know each other at all

294.95 296.12 B: i don't know

298.37 306.74 B: yeah that's i don't have a problem with that it's actually you know and it's it's a little different than being in a face to face situation where you get like bit nervous like the body language and
