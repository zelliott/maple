63.28 66.36 B: as far as raising the minimum wage what do you think i

73.44 74.57 A: um 

75.13 82.57 A: yeah i could see i i could see them raising it i would say six dollars would be fair

85.43 86.70 A: ah 

87.10 88.21 A: i know 

88.75 94.84 A: [sigh] f- um there was one of i don't know if they still do but there was one of the fast food restaurants that 

94.95 102.28 A: ah had something they something set up with the government ah so that their the 

102.69 106.97 A: you know the high school kids you know like first job type things 

107.10 108.37 A: they would 

108.55 110.42 A: get subsidies 

112.42 127.37 A: to help they they actu- the restaurant itself actually paid like l- paid the high school kids less than minimum wage but the but the government thing whatever it was [noise] brought it up to minimum wage to help 

119.26 120.22 B: oh 

126.17 129.18 B: oh so the government was paying some of that extra 

129.02 130.18 A: yeah 

129.58 132.35 B: well that i never heard of that was that in your area 

132.20 139.35 A: yeah it wa- i keep thinking it was hardee's or something like that but i d- it's it's been a couple of years 

136.42 137.37 B: okay 

139.44 143.56 A: and and i thought that was kinda nice you know [mn] 

143.95 148.72 B: hm well that's my money [laughter] it's your money that's paying all that extra 

149.11 160.16 B: and not the restaurant i don't know how you feel about that i don't i mean because it's you know ah government money is what comes out of your pocket and my pocket um i i'm sure if the minimum wage goes up 

151.04 152.37 A: this is true 

160.17 171.65 B: um other things have to go up as well um you know if you're shopping at wall mart or whatever and ah you know the minimum wage goes up well they can't i don't really see how they could keep those prices that low 

172.29 173.23 B: um 

172.35 177.03 A: this is true every thing el- you know it's gonna all go up accordingly 

176.41 189.81 B: right it will all go up accordingly but at the same time um i think maybe i don't know if there's so much the problem of what minimum wage should be as in which jobs that are out there should be minimum wage jobs 

190.19 195.74 A: that that's true if there was more i wouldn't say regulation 'cause that's not really 

190.30 191.71 B: (( ah i mean ah )) 

195.82 199.00 A: the right word but if there was more if 

199.25 202.15 A: if there were more guidelines anyway 

201.63 212.64 B: right i mean i know that i see yeah mcdonalds um they say and starting salary at such and such and if you become a manager you could make six fifty an hour 

202.23 203.44 A: (( as to )) 

212.60 219.17 B: and i thought to myself that's really not a whole lot above minimum wage 

219.08 223.47 A: no and not for the responsibility that you get as a manager 

219.21 220.84 B: and you know 

223.07 235.03 B: not if you're running your i think your very much correct and not for all that responsibility yet there are people who seem willing to take the jobs it's just they don't seem to stay in them that long and i think that that's understandable 

235.40 240.42 A: for that yeah i mean if they're gonna pay that kind of money i don't i wouldn't blame 'em i wouldn't be staying long either 

239.93 247.25 B: right or the level of service that you receive um you know you get what you pay for 

247.27 248.70 B: i suppose 

248.77 258.41 A: well that's like um i was laid off a little over a year ago and i was you know actively job hunting but i 

248.84 249.63 B: (( ah )) 

258.62 259.73 A: took a 

260.24 263.97 A: ah an assistant manager's job for a speedway gas station 

263.63 264.59 B: mhm 

265.09 271.46 A: seven dollars an hour that's not but and there's a l- and there's a whole lot of responsibility there 

270.89 280.84 B: well i would i would say i mean any time you're a manager there's a lot of responsibility and especially you know when you're dealing with money and you have to clo- like close out and open registers 

281.01 282.72 B: and account for everything 

283.23 284.44 B: i would think that you 

283.63 287.34 A: and i made up my mind very very quick 

286.87 287.74 B: [laughter] 

287.65 289.52 A: well i was there 

290.74 293.44 A: yeah i started like the end of january 

294.17 300.35 A: ah i d- i decided real quick that i don't like guns pointed in my face 

300.46 302.08 B: oh did you have one 

302.28 305.50 A: changed my outlook on valentine's day i promise you 

305.26 306.40 B: oh boy 

306.37 308.03 A: and it's like nah 

308.18 311.35 A: seven dollars an hour is not enough 

313.74 315.11 A: to deal with this 

315.11 316.62 B: did you work nights 

316.61 317.38 A: no 

318.01 322.74 B: even during the day huh you're right yeah it's it's you're right um i mean it it 

319.58 320.34 A: (( yup )) 

321.83 326.29 A: and i was like no thank you i said nah i 

326.63 334.42 A: i was real good friends with the manager i've known him like known him for like fifteen years and i said you know i'm sorry i 

334.56 342.08 A: said you need to look actively look for someone else i said because i'm actively looking for something else i'm not gonna 

340.31 341.35 B: (( [laughter] )) 

342.11 346.22 A: i said i have a you know i have a family i'm not doing this 

347.14 354.16 A: i said that just brought things to light real well [laughter] put things in a whole new light 

350.66 356.39 B: ah yeah i mean there's only there's only so much ah you know risk you're willing to take 

356.37 360.14 A: right and you know 

360.15 361.70 A: that's like 

362.99 368.60 A: mcdonalds and and you know the fast food restaurants in general 

368.85 370.01 A: those are 

371.62 375.96 A: those are all if you want to call them that entry level positions 

376.51 378.34 A: i guess that's what you'd call them 

377.57 382.75 B: ah right entry level just basic you know learning the responsibility of having to come 

382.70 397.10 B: to work at a certain time every day dressed properly do the job that you're supposed to do punch in and punch out ah and you know be reliable and come back just learning the basics of what the responsibility is 

385.26 387.43 A: (( yeah ah yeah [cough] )) 

392.18 393.89 A: take an active part in 

396.96 400.21 A: and i that should be 

397.08 397.83 B: (( ah )) 

400.40 404.78 A: i would say in you know in the in the five 

404.84 406.86 A: to five fifty an hour 

406.88 409.69 A: range an entry level job 

407.55 408.62 B: (( but the )) 

409.07 422.77 B: but the thing is it's it's interesting because baby sitters high school baby sitters you know expecting seven i mean it depends on where you are seven eight dollars an hour i think on the east or west coast that it maybe they expect maybe ten dollars an hour 

422.83 437.66 B: and if you know if there's older kids and you're just sort of like sit- i mean if the children are a lot of responsibility but i think if you're working in a fast food restaurant and it's busy and you're behind um a counter or you're cooking food and it's hot and 

437.52 446.75 B: and it's it's just it's just more draining i think sometimes and how could a baby sitter ask for so much money when you don't get so much for minimum wage 

447.15 449.96 B: ah still like ah same same age high school age 

449.92 451.24 A: (( this is true )) 

449.97 450.87 B: and i 

450.99 452.87 B: i just um 

452.97 463.27 B: you know and well nanny i think nannies are more than that more ten or more dollars an hour but you know that's that's different but just um like you said i think for minimum wage 

463.27 468.48 B: um is okay for high school kids but i think um 

468.47 478.53 B: for people who you know are supporting a family or even if they're not supporting a family and they live alone and they have to pay rent and they have a car to take care of ah 

477.75 482.13 A: right they're over eighteen or twenty one they need you know 

482.70 484.70 A: they need something more mm 

484.07 487.82 B: well yeah definitely ah something a lot more which you know the argument might 

487.96 489.44 B: argument might be 

487.99 493.44 A: maybe they could make a age break i mean age cut not a cut off but 

493.93 501.52 B: well i think the argument might be that well if they don't like it they could just go get educated or do something or find another job like a unioned position 

501.48 509.87 B: may pay more ah but the thing is when you got when you get these jobs ah for five or seven an hour are there any good benefits like when you were working at the gas station 

509.88 511.59 B: health benefits or anything 

510.93 512.56 A: what benefits 

512.11 513.66 B: okay nothing 

513.06 516.59 A: nah i had i had none at the gas station 

516.61 519.48 B: okay that answered my question [laughter] 

518.71 520.00 A: i had none 

519.64 520.48 B: huh 

520.99 521.96 B: so 

522.89 524.08 B: and then what 

523.04 525.81 A: well if i'd of managed to stay there another 

525.93 527.63 A: five and a half months 

527.86 528.88 B: well did you 

528.07 532.65 A: i after six months you got [sigh] 

534.15 536.71 A: i believe health insurance 

536.48 538.85 B: oh if you lasted that long 

537.24 538.20 A: and they would 

539.16 544.37 A: right if you could [laughter] stay alive that long ah [laughter] 

541.37 543.03 B: right [laughter] 

543.57 555.59 B: and you're really gonna need that health insurance too if you've got a gun pointed at your face it it's it's not worth it i think maybe pizza delivery people make the same amount anybody that's working in the fast food industry um is just you know just 

547.17 548.58 A: right 

554.94 557.81 A: pizza delivery though ah they get tips 

557.72 570.76 B: that's a point and waitresses or or servers i'm sorry servers get tips that's true and e- e- evidently some of those who work at the fancy very fancy restaurants i understand could make a very good living um 

570.67 574.61 A: oh yeah that was um you know 

575.20 584.68 A: with the tips that they make i know that they make they only pay 'em like some of 'em make minimum wage i've seen restaurants where they don't even pay minimum wage 

584.80 585.70 A: (( you know )) 

585.75 589.43 A: but you can make decent tips 

588.70 591.13 B: well more than a hundred dollars a night in tips 

591.31 592.87 B: n- not bad [laughter] 

591.71 596.22 A: and right [noise] and 

593.73 598.81 B: you know but it's true actually maybe maybe a couple of hundred depending on the type of restaurant and how many you've served 

598.82 599.90 A: right 

599.24 599.90 B: um
