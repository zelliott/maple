135.14 136.38 A: mhm 

135.94 142.87 B: and so it's tough enough you know to try to make it by the like they don't have a handle on a whole bunch of things so

162.07 166.73 B: both during college and actually right now even after college um 

167.85 174.26 B: 'cause ah i find that you know there's tradeoffs 'cause y- you can you can get a high paying job 

174.28 175.18 A: mhm 

174.48 177.25 B: but you're really not free to ah 

177.86 189.75 B: [lipsmack] i don't know how to describe it but there's just a lot of demands placed on your ah mind that and so you know you are you're getting paid but at the same time there's just a lot of stress level so you're not free to do what 

183.04 184.10 A: right 

188.16 189.44 A: (( yeah that's true )) 

189.81 191.62 B: what other things you're trying to do

245.48 249.85 B: i don't know what else five fifteen's really low um 

249.23 251.20 A: (( yeah )) 

250.21 260.08 B: i mean i know that even if you're a single just to cover like your basic expenses and let's say that's assuming like no bills just like you know rent and 

253.16 255.07 A: mhm 

259.59 261.47 A: mhm 

260.14 265.94 B: food [laughter] you're gonna have to work like you know more than the average forty hours a week 

261.71 262.88 A: yeah 

265.23 266.38 A: yeah that's 

266.96 268.94 A: that's really ridiculous mhm 

268.72 271.60 B: yeah it is it is pretty ridiculous but 

272.51 276.12 B: ah well i don't know what do you think could be done [laughter] 

276.13 277.13 B: or 

276.50 277.67 A: i 

278.70 281.60 A: i don't know [laughter] i don't control where the money goes 

281.20 282.53 B: right 

281.93 285.21 A: (( but i mean i probably figuring like well i mean )) 

286.37 288.89 A: (( yeah can't get over that um [noise] )) 

289.59 297.70 A: but as far as like the food service jobs or whatever i always figure that you know they basically get by on the tips is what it is 

297.72 299.35 B: oh okay yeah their 

298.69 300.42 A: or those kind of situations 

300.64 302.39 B: right 

303.16 306.62 B: yeah i can't think of just something that's just strictly minimum wage like that 

305.78 307.54 A: i can't [noise] either like 

307.69 314.91 A: usually like especially when you're in high school like oh you got a job what d'you get eight dollars or something like that or like they really you know 

312.54 313.86 B: yeah 

315.01 316.55 A: how many kids get jobs that are like 

316.81 318.01 A: (( yeah i don't know )) 

317.36 321.45 B: right right something like that are are you calling from u._c._l._a. right now 

321.41 323.57 A: no i'm actually in orange county right now 

323.24 324.38 B: oh okay 

324.14 325.44 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

324.85 326.11 B: (( oh so )) 

328.48 330.41 B: yeah i think ah 

331.76 337.03 B: i don't know i think they there could be things done like ah maybe redistributing 

337.10 345.52 B: a lot of the tax dollars [laughter] you know especially like right now being used for war and stuff like that 

344.90 346.82 A: right 

345.87 354.81 B: you know it could be used to help like more social programs and um get i mean more so than just you know helping people get money i think that 

354.76 368.18 B: helping people get educated um not so much in the sense of institutionalized education but just educated in terms of how the system works ah i don't know i mean i guess you're kind of still in school but um 

356.67 357.82 A: mhm 

363.78 364.74 A: (( [noise] well [noise] )) 

368.18 372.31 B: i mean like there's i i believe there's like a fine line really between ah 

372.34 383.90 B: what educated means and you know most people consider that having you know if you have like a doctorate or whatnot you know you're educated but i personally you know and that's another thing that kind of leans towards this minimum wage is i know 

376.49 378.47 A: (( [noise] right )) 

383.86 390.68 B: tons of people who are you know ah educated in the sense that they know a lot and more so than those people who 

390.69 402.71 B: you know have degrees and i myself also have a degree but you know that's where i'm coming speaking from both sides of the tree is that um most people who have degrees and that that type of education um 

393.84 395.02 A: right 

402.85 407.55 B: aren't really so much educated in the sense that they're just um 

407.61 412.09 B: regurgitating stuff from ah you know books and things that have written 

409.24 410.28 A: right 

410.74 412.73 A: book smart 

412.00 423.30 B: by other people which is just you know i- in any type of field i don't care if it's science or whatever it's just theories you know 'cause nothing in the universe can be confirmed as as a absolute so you know th- 

416.75 417.92 A: mhm 

423.28 431.55 B: that's the type of education i think people need to know is kinda like you know it's kind of like the matrix thing and i don't want to get too [laughter] too you know like h- 

429.56 430.88 A: [laughter] 

431.57 443.70 B: as it's not a conspiracy theory it's just kind of like things that people don't really think about 'cause they're so caught up in trying to make it according to the rules of the system [lipsmack] but um i mean when it boils down to it 

435.86 437.35 A: mhm 

443.59 448.47 B: um it doesn't let a lot of people who are really educated and who do have a mind of their own 

448.50 454.86 B: um do things to ah earn money because you know it's like i myself i'm like um 

454.75 467.00 B: a struggling artist or whatever you want to call it art i don't really care [laughter] but i just you know i just try to do things on my own and i've found you know i've worked in jobs in corporations or whatnot and i find that 

456.42 457.38 A: mhm 

458.86 459.72 A: okay 

466.79 472.39 B: that's what you know really it taxes it takes taxing on your mind so you end up resorting to 

470.84 472.57 A: mhm 

472.30 483.22 B: um you know jobs that don't pay well like minimum wage jobs or whatnot just so you could have that freedom of not having to you know excuse the english kiss arse and do all these you know 

478.47 479.39 A: right 

482.07 483.87 A: right 

483.19 493.29 B: um procedural things that you really don't want to do because i mean me i i went i kinda came out of college naive thinking oh you know you have the skills that's all that matters 

493.15 494.14 A: mhm 

493.44 504.00 B: you know but then it's like it's really not that there's a whole bunch of politics involved in um you know and ah you know there's ah most people you know end up dealing with the politics 'cause you know it's ah 

504.05 511.30 B: you have to have the money or you know to get things that you want and it just depends on the lifestyle you want to live but um 

511.47 516.33 B: i guess for people who don't who want to have that freedom you end up resorting to minimum wage jobs 

516.29 524.48 B: and you know that's why it makes it tough for like any type of society like that to progress 'cause you have people who really need to have their ideas 

524.43 537.42 B: um put forth and out there and it's kind of like at the bottom you know of society and not too highly regarded and and and taken seriously for their ideas 'cause you know you don't have that certificate [laughter] so 

535.85 538.21 A: right yeah 

537.33 544.77 B: ah yeah i mean so that's kinda i guess how minimum wage comes into that [laughter] is um 

544.84 556.77 B: you know you get paid ah a lot less but it's not necessarily just poor people um working minimum wage jobs i know a lot of people with brilliant brilliant minds just unable to like get off their feet because 

556.73 570.48 B: there's just a lot of ah politics and you know human emotions involved when it comes to trying to like create things and it's kind of tough cause just you know do that but anyhow [laughter] 

569.34 571.30 A: right 

571.12 576.29 B: ah what else let's see five fifteen [laughter] 

576.76 586.18 B: if you were to make five fifteen a hour and you worked forty hours a week you would less taxes i say you you'd make like a hundred 

586.24 587.69 B: fifty tops 

588.03 590.84 A: (( [noise] times let's see four weeks )) 

589.85 592.18 B: yeah it's like six hundred bucks and that's 

592.57 598.16 B: and you know nowadays they take off for everything it's not just taxes it's like social security and all that 

596.67 599.29 A: right and medicare and all that 

598.44 599.89 B: so it's like between five six hun-
