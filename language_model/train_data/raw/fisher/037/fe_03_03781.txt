40.78 43.41 A: uh today's topic's what comedy 

43.27 50.14 B: th- they something about where do you draw the line between good humor and bad humor with bad taste 

49.37 53.54 A: i think everybody's got a different different should have a different opinion on 

53.61 59.77 B: yeah yeah i i'm pretty i'm pretty liberal so i don't find too much in bad taste 

55.06 58.16 A: (( that )) 

59.35 70.09 A: [mn] i'm the same way i figured that um if you're offended by things some people say uh you don't have a very good a very strong opinion of yourself 

69.78 76.91 B: yeah yeah yeah it's it's a little bit of a i don't know a weakness if you can't just let it r- you know roll off your back 

76.33 84.07 A: right that's a- amazing that the people i've talked to on here um we all seem to have somewhat the same opinions 

84.04 92.55 A: um about even the different topics um and this is my third call how many calls have you had third 

90.44 92.34 B: this is my third one also 

92.70 96.43 A: i'm talked to all men every time 

95.07 97.38 B: oh i've talked to one girl 

96.85 97.88 A: one girl 

97.49 101.89 B: yeah and uh i forget it was about pets or something so 

100.61 108.18 A: yeah but uh what do you watch comedy central 

105.42 109.33 B: no i act- actually haven't but i know there's a lot of stuff that 

109.16 120.91 B: that some people might call questionable taste but not me i'm sure but i just haven't got wrapped up into watching that channel but i know there's some good stuff like the man show and all on there that i hear about 

111.58 113.40 A: right 

120.64 130.74 A: yeah now see that's the man show i saw it a couple of times and i i don't care for it at all however um i i just think it's um 

131.44 135.22 A: for me wrong i don't i don't have any reason to watch it it's not funny to me 

134.90 135.86 B: yeah 

135.28 138.94 A: not necessarily that it's in bad taste it's just not funny 

138.04 140.05 B: yeah it's there there's uh 

139.96 147.34 B: i don't know there's something yeah that would be the the where i draw the line it's not necessarily bad taste it's just all right if it's not funny 

146.81 148.07 A: right 

147.16 160.53 B: and you're just hoping that being you know taking some uh i don't know politically incorrect angle and it's trying to make it funny if it's not funny it's not funny you know andrew dice clay i never thought was funny 

157.05 159.69 A: (( right )) 

160.27 162.39 A: (( right )) 

160.66 168.61 B: and uh his was all considered bad taste but he just wasn't funny it had nothing to do with how how wrong it was it was just 

164.56 167.44 A: [laughter] 

168.46 172.87 A: [noise] and i wonder if that's where a lot of people make the decision that it's bad taste when it's not funny 

173.07 175.72 A: is that what do you think that's what some people think 

173.15 174.62 B: yeah maybe 

176.40 182.45 B: 'cause there's some funny stuff uh you ever you well isn't no the chris rock show was a._c._o. 

182.52 190.84 B: h- his stuff will will go along some of those lines but his stuff is pretty funny most of the time i don't know if you've heard any of his stand up comedy 

188.58 197.59 A: oh yeah yeah and i like his lewis black's another one that i really like um have you heard of him but uh-huh 

195.85 197.29 B: lewis black 

197.45 199.11 B: no i haven't heard of him 

198.64 212.48 A: [cough] oh if you ever catch him on sometime you should watch him i think he's very funny because he's mostly his is political humor and um it's it's just to me it's very funny um 

212.96 219.42 A: the radio shows you listen to any of the radio shows in the morning 

215.93 217.93 B: no but i've uh 

218.15 224.53 B: my brother keeps telling me of one they they'll they'll replay the broadcast on the internet like and uh 

224.99 235.66 B: i forget which one he i think he said they're based in washington and some thing and and they do i don't know he says it's really funny but i don't know which one you got in mind 

235.16 238.93 A: uh well bob and tom john boy and billy 

237.57 240.42 B: bob and tom i think is one my brother told me about 

239.64 248.26 A: yeah bob and tom they're they're pretty good bob and tom i don't know where they're out of i thought they were out of north carolina but i could be wrong um 

248.55 254.99 A: usually bob and tom are pretty good um and they're usually on the rock stations or the classic rock stations 

255.08 269.84 A: and uh they're pretty good but they have different comedians on every day and uh it amazes me how much how hard they try to be funny sometimes and and they're not they're always trying to set the comedians up with jokes i mean you see it coming a mile away even on the radio 

269.97 276.91 A: and uh those are annoying to me but once again i don't feel like they're in bad taste i just feel like they're stupid 

276.31 290.60 B: yeah yeah i i think it's probably there's there's a line between the good comedian and the bad how do you how do you determine what peop- what what what a school teacher will call bad taste how do you make it funny and accepted uh 

286.87 292.65 A: right right 

290.75 294.11 B: i don't know that's kind of the thing you listen to howard stern any 

294.09 298.83 A: no i haven't listened to i saw him a few times probably a couple of years ago but um 

299.24 302.60 A: it's just not my thing really i'm not into 

301.34 308.14 B: yeah i used to listen to him but but it he's considered bad taste and some of the stuff he says it's 

308.10 308.67 B: it's 

308.65 313.16 B: it's shocking because he's they call him the shock shark and he but that's what he 

313.15 325.38 B: really thinks and it's actually what a lot of people think but he's the one that's he's just the one that says it it's not really necessarily funny it's just more shock i guess because he's not trying to be funny necessarily but 

313.81 315.67 A: (( right )) 

324.17 337.93 A: yeah it amazes me that just like you just said the people that um say things they consider they have you know those people have bad taste yet most of us think the things they're saying anyway or we think they're true 

337.76 341.57 B: [cough] yeah yeah now there is probably a uh 

342.53 355.02 B: regardless of what people accept uh is is is a a place in a place in time for it you know like i don't know like i've worked in really corporatey environments and there's no way 

355.09 357.28 B: (( you would consider i don't know )) 

357.79 364.90 B: i don't saying some certain things that might be funny but you know you know the job could be on the line kind of thing just for 

364.93 366.81 B: a little bit of humor's sake 

366.46 374.03 A: but that's uh i think that's and maybe that's um something they should have clarified a little more on this phone deal 

373.88 387.00 A: um i thought of whenever i thought of the subject they were talking comedian's comedy like something you'd watch i didn't even think about you know the angle of you know stuff you would do to be funny at work or things you would do in the public just to be funny 

386.59 387.76 B: yeah 

387.18 388.06 A: um 

388.53 395.61 A: i i don't i watch m._t._v. it's got a show called punk and yeah 

392.89 396.74 B: oh yeah that's a good one i've got 'em all taped on the tivo 

396.75 406.79 A: i love that thing a- and uh it's a good show i i don't really think they're ever in bad taste um and lots of things they do are actually funny now you have a tivo 

406.68 408.10 B: yeah i got the tivo 

407.57 409.44 A: how do you like it 

408.40 410.42 B: it's awesome it's uh 

410.41 424.18 B: i i i did everything i could to upgrade my satellite receiver to get the tivo on it it's uh so awesome the deals are just you know tape you know just push a couple of buttons and and and it's all on screen it's 

424.33 429.48 B: and the other thing is uh it eliminates the need for the v._c._r. so now i can have 

429.67 437.29 B: uh everything taped right onto there because i have a huge home home entertainment set up and the v._c._r.s really don't work with that i mean 

436.63 439.27 A: how many hours of programming can you 

439.32 442.37 A: program on yours about thirty 

439.68 441.31 B: about about thirty 

441.66 444.11 B: yeah so i've never filled it up 

443.37 446.70 A: and that'll leave commercials and everything out 

445.59 450.24 B: it'll it'll it'll it tapes commercials and everything so you you 

450.73 460.85 B: what you really have to do to get rid of the commercials you can't get rid of them 'cause there's nothing in the programming that cues it to screen it out you just you can fast forward through them so 

457.40 459.03 A: (( right )) 

459.33 466.03 A: right just like if you taped it in normally and you said yours come with your satellite 

461.96 463.36 B: yeah so 

465.27 470.15 B: it didn't come with it i've been a satellite user for years and i just upgraded my receiver 

469.99 471.77 A: (( oh )) 

470.67 473.47 B: but you can get it as a new subscriber 

473.42 476.05 A: yeah my uh wife's having a fit for tivo 

476.12 478.70 B: i pay i gotta say it's it was the best thing 

479.05 480.08 A: oh 

479.41 481.65 B: (( it was the best thing you know )) 

481.72 485.91 B: much better [laughter] than than playing around with v._c._r. and stuff 

486.38 491.24 B: and the fast forward is much faster than v._c._r. as well so 

491.19 496.50 A: oh good um well i guess we got off subject i don't know if that's what they're looking for but 

491.93 493.00 B: (( uh yeah )) 

493.86 499.27 B: [laughter] well now well we're i'm recording funny shows 

498.73 500.71 A: yeah [laughter] 

499.73 505.42 B: so yeah i don't know yeah the work place angle is uh something that i don't know 

505.40 515.67 B: there's where the bad taste thing in humor even even when i think it it shouldn't be done in the work place so much only because it it brings in an element of of uh 

515.50 516.10 A: (( [noise] )) 

516.22 519.13 B: of a personal side of people that you know 

519.24 521.14 B: probably you know 

521.76 530.50 B: i don't know it's probably not the best idea to have ev- everyone knowing all your personal thoughts whether it's coming out from a humorous statement or whatever 

526.76 529.65 A: (( yeah )) 

530.82 532.95 B: i mean what what what kind of place do you work in 

532.80 534.85 A: um actually i'm in school 

534.49 535.74 B: oh okay 

535.18 538.59 A: and that's why we're moving to gainesville i'm going to vet school up in gainesville 

538.05 540.02 B: oh okay lucky you 

540.16 543.39 A: yeah lucky me for the next seven years 

542.74 544.58 B: [laughter] 

544.62 546.47 A: but um 

547.16 554.62 A: i found you know most people are [noise] i guess try to be politically correct and i think that's probably where they 

554.93 563.74 A: say that this is bad you know this or that is bad taste or they get bring religion into it and people don't ever want you making fun of religion so 

562.88 564.01 B: yeah 

564.03 566.60 B: are you religious does that kind of humor bother you 

565.25 566.30 A: no 

566.31 569.06 A: doesn't bother me i enjoy it um 

567.94 570.65 B: [laughter] 

569.67 578.28 A: and i like you know it doesn't bother me when um i'm an atheist and when people make fun of atheists it don't bother me you know 

577.15 578.53 B: yeah i mean 

578.80 580.52 B: you gotta be i think you 

581.25 587.71 B: i know i think you're a strong person if you can let whatever's said just roll right off your back whether it's someone really trying to offend ya 

585.69 586.98 A: (( [noise] )) 

588.14 592.64 B: or or just trying to or saying something with the intention of humor 

592.30 593.81 A: right 

592.70 594.55 B: that might offend you but 

593.88 596.64 A: (( and a lot of times it's easier to say than to do )) 

596.68 598.82 A: even sometimes uh 

598.87 599.95 A: (( you know there's lots ))
