123.81 135.30 B: i i only know like based on some of the t._v. things uh on his sitcom i mean that's like like a comedy of the little things in daily life 

134.81 138.51 A: right and that is um which is so funny that you could every day

167.75 172.30 B: successful comedians do that type of comedy and like somebody 

171.56 172.39 A: [noise] 

172.80 177.52 B: like jay leno for example is a similar type of comedy 

175.53 176.54 A: [noise] 

179.61 186.23 A: like i never heard of him [noise] jay leno oh jay leno yeah yeah 

181.60 183.56 B: jay leno from the tonight show 

184.14 187.87 B: yeah except you know of course he he does a lot of uh

204.20 206.59 A: political 

205.85 206.98 B: satire 

207.23 211.46 A: right yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's um but i believe he's more of um 

212.01 213.33 A: (( very um )) 

213.96 218.08 A: prepared he doesn't bring it out very well i i don't enjoy him as well as um 

218.15 221.45 A: um how does it what's his name that guy 

221.52 222.09 A: (( [noise] )) 

224.99 226.77 A: (( uh )) 

225.75 227.05 B: david letterman 

227.35 234.32 A: not david letterman he's a guy jewish guy what's his name that he does the just do stand ups once in a while 

235.01 236.53 A: jackie mason 

236.19 237.10 B: (( ah )) 

237.19 241.93 A: now he will put down a piece of comedy that's droll you know no one could repeat it you know what i mean 

244.38 249.27 B: ah yeah well i i heard him uh years ago when 

245.43 246.57 A: (( you ever heard of him [noise] )) 

249.75 252.44 B: he was doing some stand up comedy on t._v. 

252.74 253.93 B: but um 

254.16 261.77 B: i know that recently you know in recent years some people say that his comedy is is offensive 

263.24 268.48 A: it is offensive in a way but it's like when he goes through the daily life 

268.59 270.29 A: he 

271.34 273.60 A: (( he puts it down so well that )) 

274.12 286.49 A: you would repeat it and you wouldn't laugh but when he says it it's so interesting so funny that's what a comedian is all about i don't believe a comedian is someone who can repeat jokes a comedian is someone who could put down a nice joke in a nice way 

286.70 290.64 A: that's what a comedian is all about the way they put it out 

288.34 292.65 B: well a a lot of it has to do with how how it's delivered yeah 

291.92 304.15 A: yeah that's right and that is the main thing that i believe you know jokes you could read all over in the newspaper and anybody can tell tell jokes but um i believe comedy's all about the way you say it and deliver it [mn] 

304.23 308.11 B: yeah well there there's also physical comedy 

308.39 313.46 B: you know which is which is a little different from just plain stand up comedy 

314.26 317.16 B: you know like slapstick comedy 

316.29 317.19 A: [noise] 

319.19 322.39 B: or uh more physical things that are funny 

322.56 323.76 A: (( like acting )) 

324.08 324.99 B: (( uh-huh )) 

325.34 330.03 A: right yeah that that that is part of um when you deliver a comedy that's how 

330.11 333.56 A: it's the way your faces are the way you act the way you do stuff [noise] 

333.36 334.97 B: yeah 

336.06 337.24 B: but um 

338.11 343.80 B: i like i like political satire a lot um there was that guy 

343.86 349.85 B: who um lost his program a couple of months ago bill myer uh 

350.05 353.63 B: politically incorrect was the name of the show ever see that 

352.76 355.08 A: (( right right right right )) 

354.06 358.67 B: yeah i i like that kind of uh comedy also which is 

358.94 363.80 B: um almost more like discussion sometimes 

364.37 366.25 A: mhm 

367.11 373.09 A: i hear what you're saying so political [mn] but when you're talking about the comedy it's more of um 

374.67 375.81 A: um 

376.63 378.27 A: a broad um 

378.55 385.68 A: you can't just keep on um it's just the topic that you like when you talk about you you like that topic it sounds like 

386.38 391.38 A: it's the difference between a comedy to a comedy it's the different topics they talk about one day they'll talk about um 

391.70 402.56 A: government that's what you like and then politic and and the next bar it's comedy about the daily life both of them are comedy but you you just choose a topic a different topic 

402.37 405.40 B: yeah yeah i mean uh 

405.45 407.00 B: i know that um 

407.12 410.39 B: someone like jay leno um 

411.21 413.05 B: you know he he likes to 

413.39 416.26 B: be somebody who who's seen as 

416.35 428.35 B: uh kind of being in the center politically so you know if he makes a joke about you know the republicans one day he'll make a joke about the democrats the next day 

430.77 439.04 A: [noise] that is that is correct but i don't know for some reason i feel that um jay leno when i listen to his convers- to his shows 

439.37 443.72 A: he's very prepared for it you know you can see it in him 

444.32 447.44 A: he's very like prepared for everything and 

447.88 451.42 A: [mn] particularly with uh the the smoothness of it 

449.47 452.35 B: [mn] it's not it's not spontaneous enough like 

452.10 454.37 A: right that's what i see 

452.74 455.51 B: too too pr- it's over over prepared 

455.80 461.97 A: yeah but you know [mn] if yeah yeah if you're reading into it it it is over prepared 

456.19 457.26 B: too too slick 

462.48 464.55 B: yeah well you know of course 

462.50 463.70 A: (( but um )) 

464.79 472.61 B: there are a lot of people writ- writing that material for him and mostly he's just reading it from cards you know that's how they do 

471.56 476.12 A: friends for example is so so good so much good lines [noise] the 

477.93 479.30 A: show friends 

479.47 480.84 B: (( it sorry )) 

480.85 483.14 A: the show friends 

482.17 483.58 B: oh the show friends 

483.55 486.69 A: that is a comedy but there's a lot of good solid lines 

486.03 487.89 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

490.08 492.22 A: (( understand )) 

490.98 495.42 B: yeah yeah so so what do you find funny about that show for example 

495.63 497.12 A: (( what )) 

496.42 499.16 B: what do you find funny about the show friends 

499.03 505.77 A: [noise] it's based it's again it's very similar to um a a seinfeld but a more um 

506.51 514.23 A: a daily life a sitcom with four people or five people that they keep on going about their daily life and they 

514.47 515.26 A: make 

517.37 518.95 A: [mn] funny um 

520.04 526.85 A: fun of each other and and it's a lot of good lines in there a lot of good jokes in there um 

526.85 534.93 B: mhm yeah so so th- those are both comedy shows where some of the comedy comes from the relationships 

535.14 539.20 B: between the people that you know you you've you've seen 

537.26 537.99 A: (( [noise] )) 

539.61 541.15 B: (( over time yeah okay )) 

544.79 548.65 A: (( right [noise] )) 

550.66 558.24 A: right it is it is but it's also about the daily daily life you know you're doing a daily what goes on in the daily life 

558.14 559.48 B: (( right right so )) 

559.60 571.14 B: um you know the the question was w- where where do you draw the line and say you know that something is not funny and we we talked about vulgarity you know bad language 

571.17 573.25 B: um are there other things that partic- 

572.87 576.86 A: [noise] where do we draw the line between comedy and not comedy 

575.58 576.64 B: yeah 

577.48 580.95 A: oh how am i gonna put that down um 

586.07 587.37 A: (( um )) 

589.01 591.75 A: (( where do i draw the line with comedy and not comedy ))
