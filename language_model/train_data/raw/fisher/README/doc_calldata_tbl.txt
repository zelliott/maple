3  TOPICID   -- ENGnn, matches the "id=..." attribute of a topic in topics.sgm
4  SIG_GRADE -- variable-length numeric ("N" or "N.N"): perceived signal quality
5  CNV_GRADE -- variable-length numeric ("N" or "N.N"): perceived conversation quality
6  APIN      -- subject-id of speaker on channel A, matches first field of pindata.tbl
7  ASEX.DIA  -- [m|f].[a.o] : male or female, American or other English dialect

# Notes:
#
# The first line of the table is the comma-delimited string of field names.
#
# The SIG_GRADE and CNV_GRADE numbers represent an "average" score of percieved
# quality for signal (relative noise or distortion) and conversation content
# (topicality, "directed speech"), where 0 is "worst score" and 4 is "best".
#
# The [AB]SEX.DIA fields have "m" or "f" for speaker sex, and "a" or "o"
# for speaker dialect (American vs. Other), as reported by auditors.
#
# The [AB]PHNUM fields are "encrypted" to conceal the actual phone
# numbers of subjects, but they are kept distinct, and the true area
# codes and exchanges (first three digits of the local 7-digit number)
# are retained; a given four-digit sequence always produces the same
# distinct 3-letter encrypted string.  The collection system sometimes
# failed to retain the phone number, or stored only a partial string;
# in these cases, you'll find the strings "no_APHNUM" or "no_BPHNUM"
# in the respective fields.
#
# The "PHSET" and "PHTYP" fields hold the responses provided by
# callers to questions about the kind of phone equipment/service they
# were using during the call; this information is missing for a number
# of calls in the collecion.  During the first few months of the
# collection, these responses were not being gathered -- the early
# calls are tabulated with just the "PHTYP" value (cell vs. cordless
# vs. standard), where this was available based on the subjects'
# registered phone information.  Even after we started collecting
# these responses during the call, they were not always successfully
# captured (or not always provided by the subject).
