3.06 4.96 B: hi cammie i'm kim 

5.57 9.13 A: i don't think i would take the million dollars and leave forever 

8.98 14.67 B: oh i don't think so either i lived in guam before for a while and it was quite the experience 

14.57 22.46 A: oh i've never been out of the united states but i've heard bad things so [laughter] you can only wonder where they'd send you then 

21.92 28.06 B: mhm yeah when i lived there it was like ten years ago but they rationed your electricity 

28.16 35.23 B: you'd pick up the newspaper in the morning if you could get one and it would tell you what times like two hour spurts you would have electricity for and everything 

35.17 36.21 A: wow 

36.06 41.31 B: yeah it's it's a lot different i mean even though it's united states territory it is ah 

41.59 43.43 B: quite different [laughter] 

43.23 44.88 A: [laughter] 

47.19 49.53 B: (( i don't know h- have you ever done one of these before )) 

49.27 50.09 A: no 

49.56 52.40 B: no i haven't either i don't know how long are we supposed to talk for 

51.92 54.27 A: [laughter] i don't know 

53.72 59.20 B: i kept getting them like last week and it would i i'd pick it up and it wouldn't say anything 

58.77 64.39 A: oh yeah like yesterday it was doing that and i'd get like four calls and i'd say well the heck with it 

64.03 69.90 B: oh i know you kept picking them up and it kept doing the same thing so i was like oh well and i know we're not supposed to be talking about this but [laughter] 

69.45 70.43 A: right 

70.81 76.95 A: well with the one million dollars thing that if you were to win the lottery even then you wouldn't have to leave 

77.57 78.95 B: this is true 

78.66 81.73 A: then would you want to share [laughter] 

80.72 83.61 B: [laughter] 

82.57 88.73 A: then you just gotta move out of the country for a while until people forget you won that money [laughter] 

88.99 91.91 B: yeah i don't think i'd even want to do that 

92.33 100.26 B: i don't know i mean after being outside it's just so much different and people treat you so much different when you're outside of the united states 

100.40 108.33 A: my father had gone to europe years ago and he said that they didn't have toilet paper it was just regular paper 

107.88 108.75 B: ooh 

108.64 111.07 A: right well that was years ago so i don't know 

109.90 110.96 B: (( uh-huh )) 

111.47 114.33 A: but just things you hear about different places 

114.62 122.32 A: and how these children are starving and there's no food well granted you wouldn't go there but i mean that's just how 

122.61 125.75 A: it goes to show that none of our people are starving like that 

125.62 138.38 B: i know i think if i could move maybe to an island or somewhere but with the stipulation of never being able to come back into the united states i don't know i'd just miss everybody i've got a grandson and my daughter and everybody you'd never be able to see anybody again 

138.13 142.28 A: right or talk to them if they don't have communication 

139.51 140.56 B: yeah 

142.73 144.12 B: this is true 

144.88 152.34 B: that was another thing it was just everything was so backward when i lived in guam too it was like some of the stuff you watched on t._v. happened a month ago 

152.37 156.38 B: it'd happened like the bulls had already won the championship 

155.68 157.65 A: [laughter] 

156.57 157.60 B: but 

157.89 161.13 B: i wa- i was watching on t._v. and the play offs were just starting 

161.19 162.40 A: wow 

161.46 165.00 B: and then they'd have the news on that way so that everything was so 

164.91 177.63 B: it was like you were in a time warp you didn't know some of the stuff was only a day behind but a lot of other stuff was just you know like monday night football came on on tuesday mornings or tuesday afternoons 

177.08 181.15 A: oh see we might get sent somewhere that wouldn't even have a television or radio 

180.58 186.93 B: oh i know that would be terrible it's like it didn't say whether th- you could pick your spot too with a million dollars or 

184.54 186.02 A: [laughter] 

187.00 192.84 A: sounds like a gilligan's island kind of place where you always have food you always have clothes and 

192.91 195.25 A: that wouldn't be too bad 

194.59 199.82 B: yeah and it was warm [laughter] i don't know 

196.37 197.88 A: (( yeah you )) 

200.88 204.68 A: never know where you get stuck with maybe somewhere that only has rice 

205.93 210.48 B: yeah that wouldn't be good the survivor type stuff i don't think i could handle that 

208.57 209.42 A: right 

209.89 215.10 A: here's your million dollars but what are you going to do with it nobody accepts money where it is sending you 

215.50 216.96 B: yeah really 

217.20 221.24 B: even if they do you can't get anything that you probably wanted or whatever 

221.60 223.42 B: rice would be the big thing 

223.82 224.73 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

225.39 229.52 B: hm i don't know how long we're supposed to go on with what tells you to stop i wonder 

229.69 230.33 B: (( [laughter] )) 

230.11 234.25 A: well and i kind of wonder wh- what are we supposed to be getting out of this 

233.68 235.23 B: ah ten dollars 

235.15 236.82 A: oh okay 

236.31 238.30 B: yeah [laughter] 

237.32 239.08 A: [laughter] 

238.32 248.39 B: it's like okay [laughter] it said first i got a email and it said up to three times and then after that it's a you could be asked up to thirty times in a month 

248.10 248.99 A: (( hell )) 

248.76 250.08 B: yeah that wouldn't be 

249.03 258.07 A: well i suppose if you answer or if you don't answer the phone they might call you thirty times but you probably only have to do it three times 

254.88 256.38 B: maybe huh 

257.84 269.62 B: oh is this like my answer machine when it started picking up one of the days last week it was finally giving the topics but up until that time it must have called fifteen times and it just i'd pick up the phone and there was nothing there 

269.76 270.70 A: hm 

272.15 276.76 B: so i don't know if we're just supposed to hang up or ah stay on the line or 

277.34 278.12 B: because 

277.68 278.85 A: their dime 

278.45 286.22 B: yeah what time did it ah what time was it on the ah thing i think one thing said forty five minutes and i was like no way possible 

286.40 288.88 A: well they'd better give us more topics then 

288.60 298.23 B: yeah that's a little bit we already know no we wouldn't leave for a million dollars [laughter] to never come back especially with the state of everything is in our 

290.75 291.80 A: (( they didn't say )) 

293.29 294.42 A: yeah 

298.66 304.35 B: i watched a thing on iraq and everything the other night and iran and oh how could you live there 

304.68 313.44 A: well one time i was watching something about africa and there's some king that lives in like this gold palace and all his people live in little huts you 

313.49 315.61 A: know why would they put up with that 

315.02 316.18 B: yeah 

315.72 317.38 A: i don't understand that 

319.00 325.73 A: i i don't understand a lot of these places or like you do with the hitler thing that why did all those people listen to 

326.17 329.41 B: yeah well sometimes they have to like they were saying you know 

329.19 334.92 A: him oh yeah but all those other people that were making the other people why did they listen in the first place i 

334.71 336.58 B: yeah it's hard to say 

335.53 342.27 A: mean right it it's really unbelievable how some people can be lead into things and thinking things 

343.04 344.08 A: and be 

344.12 348.86 B: brainwashed and they don't know any other way really it's just what they've always been used to 

344.82 345.83 A: right 

348.71 349.84 A: right that 

350.29 352.55 A: you have nothing and i have it all 

352.88 356.07 A: is pretty much how a lot of it is over there anywhere 

355.54 356.77 B: mhm 

356.35 357.91 A: outside of the united states 

358.62 361.15 B: yeah i think i would rather stay here 

362.11 372.18 B: especially after all the stuff that's been happening and nine eleven and everything else it's just you couldn't trust being somewhere i'd be afraid right now to be some place else in the world 

371.59 372.60 A: (( yeah )) 

373.72 375.64 B: because they don't always treat you 

376.26 382.40 B: i know when we were in guam just because we had blond hair it was like the people would come up to ask my daughter if they could touch her 

382.74 383.85 A: (( mm )) 

383.17 387.04 B: and then five dollars for a picture they w- kept kept telling her 

387.25 390.13 B: and they just would take your picture and give you the money 

389.84 391.58 A: she didn't grow up there 

391.08 404.35 B: no no we stayed there for a summer and a typhoon was coming and we just booked out of there the last plane out it was it was bad i was like if living conditions are no we just went there after my fiance at the time had ah 

398.88 400.62 A: was this through the service 

404.31 414.08 B: retired from the service and he'd been stationed there one time and we had a boating oh we had a big boat business and a diving business in florida so it was like oh yes beautiful [laughter] 

414.16 417.97 A: [laughter] just don't talk to anybody ooh 

414.98 416.36 B: until like after 

416.63 429.85 B: yeah well we had no st- he goes we don't have a stove and i thought he was joking around and i was like yes we do and he goes i spotted there's three of them out there and he goes they don't work and i said well why not and he goes the rats chewed through the wiring

458.53 462.36 A: pet sized things living in your house that you didn't want [laughter] 

460.59 461.99 B: mhm 

463.34 464.48 A: wow 

464.37 465.94 B: yeah i don't think i'd ah 

466.09 469.14 B: want to do that again even though the weather was nice when 

469.45 470.72 B: it wasn't raining 

471.69 479.00 B: i used every pot and pan i had because the roof completely leaked and there was just holes in the wall [laughter] i mean 

479.14 486.45 A: see so you probably actually went back in time to when your great great great grandparents were [laughter] around 

485.89 487.94 B: yeah [laughter] 

486.51 488.35 A: and that's what they had to do 

488.37 493.40 B: yeah it's like right now i live i have lived in chicago most of my life up until florida and 

493.18 505.29 B: it was i was just always used to always having whatever i wanted right there and i mean the grocery stores you couldn't get hardly anything when you did find it like a half a gallon of ice cream ten years ago was ten dollars there 

505.24 506.46 A: (( mm )) 

505.76 510.46 B: and then you didn't have electricity most of the time so you better hurry up and eat it because
