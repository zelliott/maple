235.03 236.64 B: just not funny 

237.71 239.16 A: um 

242.35 244.72 A: i think they do a lot of um 

245.04 248.05 A: like what you said a lot of talking about each other 

248.14 255.21 A: you know when the other when another one isn't there and i really don't like that yeah it's like fake fake friendship 

248.15 249.02 B: uh-huh 

251.42 252.28 B: right 

255.41 256.28 A: yeah 

255.77 256.62 B: okay 

259.33 265.78 B: i had um this one roommate one time who really really thought he was funny [laughter] 

265.16 267.75 A: uh-huh but he wasn't [laughter]

273.35 274.87 A: uh-huh [sigh] 

275.32 280.52 B: about pretty much any topic and if you didn't laugh along he got angry

322.02 322.90 B: yeah

345.56 346.38 A: (( mm )) 

348.77 349.80 A: right 

349.45 354.90 B: but they manage to keep the atmosphere pretty light you know they always have um 

355.54 359.08 B: competitions going between each other and 

358.60 359.51 A: uh-huh 

359.75 365.30 B: even if like somebody's upset about something it's still 

365.65 373.60 B: really light and you know you kind of like tease the person just a little bit but not really 

371.79 372.70 A: mhm 

373.18 375.15 A: no- no- not cross the line 

378.05 380.46 A: well it must be hard working with four men

381.78 385.35 B: oh no i have the inside scoop on the male mind 

384.74 387.03 A: [laughter] ah [laughter]

387.65 388.51 A: mm 

389.68 392.12 A: yeah i would imagine so 

390.90 403.08 B: [laughter] but no it's fun it- it's really it's competitive but i'm new there and holding my own so i i think it's all right mm 

402.50 403.28 A: (( [laughter] mm )) 

403.77 404.89 A: well that's neat 

405.28 406.44 B: yeah

407.86 409.45 A: i'm an accountant 

409.76 410.82 B: oh okay 

410.35 411.29 A: yeah 

411.30 415.24 A: in a a i'm uh like the assisting controller in a factory 

415.85 416.82 B: oh 

416.44 417.48 A: yeah 

417.80 419.21 B: what kind of factory 

419.13 427.55 A: um they make ah plastic bottle caps like for a coke bottle plastic coke bottle yeah kind of boring but 

424.03 424.75 B: uh-huh 

427.83 431.12 A: it's good it's a small company and like ah 

431.76 434.04 A: i work with just two other women 

434.13 437.00 A: in the office and it's good 

437.35 438.53 B: nice 

438.01 438.97 A: yeah 

439.77 445.23 B: do you have a lot of like light hearted chatter during the day or is everything pretty serious 

443.15 444.35 A: oh yeah 

444.55 451.98 A: yeah no no they a real open minded company you know like you can as long as you get your work done they don't care what you do 

452.41 457.93 A: you know so everyone gets along well which is odd because women working with other women is 

458.03 461.13 A: they can get kind of catty sometimes yeah 

458.26 461.51 B: (( [laughter] it usually doesn't work that way yeah )) 

461.95 463.16 A: so but 

462.34 464.64 B: is everybody pretty close in age 

464.77 471.65 A: um actually no the two other women are like fifty or sixty and i'm thirty seven so 

472.13 473.04 B: okay 

472.77 474.07 A: but they're pretty cool 

478.01 479.28 B: (( [laughter] um )) 

480.30 483.70 B: do you think it's more difficult to 

485.13 487.97 B: joke around with people who are older 

488.61 489.17 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

489.82 493.17 A: um only if i know them and their personality 

493.62 495.85 A: you know and know what they 

496.58 498.64 A: what kind of humor they like you know 

498.66 499.53 B: okay 

499.23 507.08 A: because i tend to have like a drier sense of humor and i know that one woman loves that she thinks it's so hilarious and then other people like take offence to it 

507.17 511.43 A: so if you know like what they enjoy and what they like it's a lot easier 

513.14 518.40 B: yeah i i sometimes have a little bit of problem like 

518.84 521.57 B: with people who are lot older than me 

521.20 522.06 A: mhm 

522.07 523.74 B: because i'm only twenty three 

523.31 524.15 A: mhm 

524.13 528.67 B: and before i got into sales i did a lot of office secretarial kind of work 

528.29 529.15 A: mhm 

529.24 536.68 B: and when i was working with like an office manager or somebody who was in the fifty or so age range 

536.97 539.89 B: it seemed harder to 

540.11 544.82 B: keep like a friendly upbeat kind of conversation going 

544.39 545.29 A: uh-huh 

545.62 549.21 B: because they really didn't have the same 

549.52 551.54 B: points of reference that i do 

551.21 552.27 A: right 

552.62 556.33 B: and we just didn't really think the same things were funny [laughter] 

555.82 556.70 A: mhm 

558.57 564.64 A: yeah i know a lot of people like will say oh that was such a great movie or whatever and then i watch it and it's like not my kind of 

564.69 570.38 A: kind of humor at all you know so you're getting a subjective opinion 

566.59 567.67 B: right 

571.60 573.09 B: yeah 

573.77 576.51 B: an- i i guess it's like when they're older 

576.35 577.23 A: mhm 

576.83 579.13 B: when the people you work with are a lot older 

579.26 582.66 B: ah they seem to try take a parental kind of role 

582.20 583.94 A: right yeah 

583.30 585.60 B: and sort of a supervisor kind of role 

585.04 586.01 A: right 

586.69 588.03 B: and 

589.45 591.84 B: that doesn't always make it so easy to 

592.71 595.57 B: at least for me to get along in a work environment 

594.94 595.90 A: right 

596.53 598.50 A: well there's a fine line between 

599.14 599.89 A: (( like kind of a ))
