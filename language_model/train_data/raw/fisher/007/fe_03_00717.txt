1.49 4.08 B: hi uh i'm alexandra 

4.32 6.02 A: hi i'm betty 

6.29 7.71 B: hi nice to meet you 

7.29 9.00 A: nice to meet you too 

8.57 10.18 B: [laughter] 

10.42 15.24 A: what do you think you think i don't know i guess i would 

15.39 21.11 A: panic or actually i would remain calm because i know if i panic it's going to make it worse 

20.33 28.00 B: [mn] uh i could probably see being calm in the beginning and then [laughter] panicking as it got worse and worse 

27.45 31.67 A: [noise] [laughter] [laughter] 

28.96 29.93 B: yeah 

30.34 32.83 B: [laughter] yeah like that that's right 

32.25 34.97 A: (( something like to that effect but no um )) 

34.97 47.41 A: i um i think i would i mean 'cause sometimes you think you would just like really freak out during something and then you realise that you do have a certain degree of you do retain a certain degree of calm 

47.15 48.78 B: yeah you would probably 

48.31 58.15 A: yeah 'cause i was involved in a fire [laughter] when i was in junior high school and you know they were evacuating everybody and i was i was surprisingly calm 

51.27 52.34 B: oh 

58.25 59.82 B: oh well that's good 

59.24 60.31 A: (( yeah i was )) 

60.71 64.03 A: a with this i mean it was pretty big it took out the whole cafeteria 

64.28 72.37 A: but you know in a terrorist attack and stuff like that i guess you know now that i have kids i mean i would not panic but then i would really have to keep my bearings for their sakes 

72.37 75.54 B: yeah you would think of what's important i guess 

72.43 72.99 A: (( [noise] )) 

74.84 78.30 A: yeah you'd have to get them out and whatever it is that you gotta do 

78.63 84.25 B: but i think the general atmosphere would be of panic i mean you can imagine people 

84.92 87.79 A: yeah 'cause around here we've had 

85.45 88.22 B: getting in their cars planes 

87.96 99.67 A: yeah well round here we've had a couple of shopping centers that have been threatened with bomb scares and you know different terrorist tactics and stuff and i mean i don't go out much i'm a stay at home mom 

99.80 102.05 B: uh i'm pregnant right now [laughter] 

102.14 104.47 A: oh how far on are you 

102.22 103.92 B: and that's what i'll be too 

104.35 105.89 B: uh six months 

105.27 106.80 A: this is your first 

106.22 107.78 B: yes [laughter] 

107.00 111.65 A: well you know you'll find that the children they either make you or break you 

111.87 113.02 B: uh well 

112.05 119.13 A: i mean mine made me they refined me considerably and you know what you think you put them before anything else 

119.26 120.22 B: yeah 

119.49 129.02 A: like during a terrorist attack the first thing your first thought is get my kids out you don't even after a while you don't even think about yourself all you want to do is just make sure that they're gonna be ok 

128.70 132.65 B: yeah but you have to be you know able to 

132.69 135.77 B: help them i mean so you do have to think of yourself too 

132.91 134.85 A: oh sure sure 

135.60 146.95 A: yeah so you know you have to be able bodied and stuff i mean if you're injured you're injured but you know it's like they say you got like the superhuman effort and stuff the suit like a super dose of adrenalin 

138.51 139.42 B: yeah 

145.17 146.21 B: (( yeah )) 

146.34 148.32 B: the adrenalin that's right 

147.88 160.61 A: you got a big adrenalin rush when you know okay i gotta get my kids out gotta get me out gotta you know got a lot to live for when you have when you have just your children it's like oh i have three this is my i'll close up the shop i have three of them 

151.29 152.64 B: [laughter] 

159.56 160.37 B: [laughter] 

160.78 164.04 B: it depends whether there's too you know what kind of attacks 

163.97 170.66 A: yeah 'cause the world trade centre thing was so i mean i know a lot of people who were there because i'm i'm originally from new york city 

170.93 174.86 B: that's where i am i mean i'm not in manhattan but i'm nearby 

173.86 176.23 A: [noise] oh which part of new york are you from 

175.72 176.76 B: queens 

176.71 179.99 A: oh right over the bridge i'm from the bronx 

177.33 178.64 B: we're in queens 

179.46 180.24 B: oh 

180.51 190.67 A: a lot of my family was there right you know a lot of them they i have one cousin who really she kept really kept her bearing she is in a she was like right across the street 

190.75 191.69 B: (( uh-huh )) 

191.15 196.46 A: and she's in a wheelchair so you know she really she was really heroic about it and she got out 

193.11 194.33 B: oh really 

196.46 197.88 B: she left early 

197.53 204.67 A: yeah no she was she just made it out she made it out after the explosion [noise] and you really couldn't see anything was like so 

205.39 210.73 A: it was so so full of smoke and and ash i mean it was horrible 

210.48 212.30 B: yeah i saw that 

211.40 216.65 A: something like that is just like so daunting and like wow how do i get out of this 

216.22 218.77 B: i would think that most people would be thinking 

218.78 220.93 B: i've gotta leave here [laughter] you know 

220.58 221.63 A: yeah 

221.07 222.66 B: i've gotta get away 

222.31 233.78 A: well you know as some said there were some people who were really heroic they had time to get out and they stopped and they went back and they got other people but you know i mean i don't know that's the kind of situation where you [noise] really got to be in it 

234.40 236.01 B: yeah it just depends 

234.61 241.39 A: but you know we can only speculate on what we would do i mean a lot of things in life are like that oh i don't know what i would do 

241.33 252.46 A: if you know if i went through such and such as such thing well guess what you know i was i was always afraid to go through you know i said oh my goodness it labor sounds like it really hurts it really it your mental attitude 

251.42 255.59 B: yes it does [laughter] and that's what i've been thinking about now i mean 

254.50 258.97 A: well you know it's your mental attitude really makes a difference 

259.01 261.70 B: but it's hard to control fear 

259.14 262.14 A: because you know take the le mars classes 

262.17 263.12 B: take what 

262.25 264.99 A: take the la mars classes they will help you 

263.56 266.48 B: oh yeah i'll get to that eventually but 

265.55 271.75 A: uh-huh and and to get get yourself a book called supernatural childbirth 

271.72 273.25 B: supernatural 

272.83 277.60 A: yeah it's called supernatural childbirth i had two pain free children with that 

277.32 279.12 B: really mhm 

278.17 290.89 A: yeah because what it does instead of focusing on breathing and relaxation what you're basically doing is you're praying through this thing [noise] well you know like anything in life you pray through it and god gets you through i mean there's the same thing with the terrorist attack 

285.13 286.16 B: (( uh-huh )) 

290.64 294.86 B: but that only works if you are religious and believe in god [laughter] 

293.82 300.84 A: no not really not really because i didn't consider myself a highly religious person when i when i first did it 

300.82 302.55 B: but when you felt the pain 

302.41 306.56 A: but i was like let me tell you pain has a very humbling effect 

304.84 307.21 B: [laughter] 

307.66 308.99 B: [laughter] 

307.88 309.39 A: please help me 

309.40 316.37 A: [laughter] yeah but you know it's not anything unbearable especially if you i mean i had really large children if you have a normal size child 

315.76 322.15 B: well i really hope so 'cause i'm only five feet tall [laughter] if i have a big baby i'm through it 

318.85 329.21 A: oh okay you're only five feet tall and if you have something in the six pound area the way most people do you'll be okay the problem with me is my kids were nine fourteen 

323.83 324.73 B: (( uh )) 

328.70 331.58 B: that's a lot that is really a lot 

329.96 335.88 A: yeah mine were almost my my i had my last one was they had to induce me 

335.89 339.16 A: two weeks early because he was really getting huge 

337.69 341.17 B: getting too big yeah i mean how could you get it out 

339.57 344.55 A: well they induced me two weeks early and he was nine pounds and nine ounces 

343.79 345.64 B: yep really big 

345.32 349.51 A: now that's more pain than any terrorist could possibly inflict on me honey 

349.23 352.21 B: i can only imagine and 

350.46 354.43 A: [laughter] yeah and he has well he had really broad shoulders and he's gonna be like a big 

353.54 355.10 B: oh man 

354.85 356.67 A: strapping hunk of man 

356.32 360.31 B: well that's good for him but it's not good when he's coming out [laughter] 

358.01 359.50 A: yeah well you 

359.59 363.84 A: know it's like i told you get that book and um 

364.25 371.50 A: 'cause really god can get you through anything terrorists labor you name it i mean i found him in labor i was like there you are 

370.86 372.40 B: [laughter] 

371.73 374.13 A: (( [laughter] making this whole thing bearable )) 

374.26 381.15 A: 'cause it's like nothing you've ever felt it's like you know the the cramps you didn't get for the nine months 

381.24 383.58 A: they give them all to you in the same day 

382.14 384.20 B: they all come at once 

384.13 385.53 A: [laughter] 

384.39 387.92 B: yeah that's really nice [laughter] 

386.54 394.51 A: [laughter] they give 'em all to you in the same day but you know what they're not unbearable i had a nurse who was an angel she put hot towels on my back 

394.39 396.15 B: yeah heat will help 

394.83 397.47 A: 'cause that's where it really gets you is in your back 

397.47 401.17 B: i would think so a lot of women say that they have that 

399.30 402.67 A: so you know what just like anything like any pain you think 

402.54 415.08 A: you know you think one way and something you know if i ever caught my husband cheating i would kill him you know what happens is that you have a good one and you catch him cheating the truth of the matter is you change like you know i would do anything to get him back 

414.75 416.12 B: yeah well 

415.96 423.33 A: you know or anything i mean that happened to me with my last one and breaking up with him ain't gonna happen with this one like honey please 

422.89 424.69 B: you better not [laughter] 

424.12 429.56 A: a change of attitude honey a drastic change of attitude 'cause you know human beings are unpredictable 

429.22 430.13 B: (( mhm )) 

430.67 433.73 A: we're about as unpredictable as we as it's gonna get 

434.71 436.70 B: yeah because we have free will 

436.69 438.30 A: yeah we certainly do 

436.80 438.52 B: to do whatever we want 

438.80 447.33 A: we have free will [noise] and and we don't we really don't know i mean some sometimes [noise] in horrible situations can you hear my nine month old 

446.84 448.14 B: (( yeah )) 

447.47 460.00 A: sometimes these horrible situations bring out the best in people sometimes they bring out the worst sometimes you panic sometimes you'll be okay you know and sometimes and like you said in the beginning you're like ah 

460.11 462.83 B: yeah there's gotta be some panic 

460.15 461.70 A: and then [laughter] 

462.70 464.31 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

464.36 466.52 A: sometimes panic is good 

467.16 470.74 A: although not really is it fear not so much panic it's fear 

470.89 481.65 A: [mn] because fear can you can use fear to drive you to save your own hide you know that's why god put it in there you know you like okay this is a bad situation i better get my happy butt out of this 

472.22 473.23 B: (( everything )) 

478.22 479.13 B: yeah 

481.22 482.65 B: self protection 

482.54 490.24 A: yeah the power of self preservation because you're like it's a you know it's scary to be caught in something like that [noise] 

485.16 486.01 B: yeah 

489.62 500.78 B: but it really depends what it is i mean if if if there's gonna be a nuclear if there's a nuclear explosion i mean that's very different from a couple of cases of anthrax you know 

497.89 499.05 A: oh yeah 

499.73 502.34 A: oh yeah with the anthrax and stuff 

501.80 503.03 B: it depends 

503.21 511.27 A: yeah but you know what it's i mean like you said the anthrax it depends on what it is or if it something like anthrax or nuclear explosion 

509.26 511.51 B: or contaminated water 

511.53 521.74 A: or i mean you know you don't know what sick and twisted thing can be conceived in the mind of somebody like osama bin laden you're like oh my goodness i mean 

519.89 520.87 B: yeah 

521.90 526.45 A: [noise] oliver north was ridiculed when he when he 

526.63 540.95 A: panicked because osama bin laden threatened him and [noise] you know when we and we i mean the the everybody put up one man to through ten kinds of changes and now we see what osama bin laden was capable of and we see that the man was right 

540.50 541.60 B: yeah 

541.76 551.10 A: in panicking over having his family threatened by this guy so you know you never know what sick thing can be conceived in the mind of one of those terrorists 

550.65 551.87 B: oh yeah 

551.49 555.47 A: and the only thing that'll keep you sane is knowing god is still in control 

555.99 556.92 B: well 

556.96 561.03 B: i'm not really religious at all so that doesn't help me much 

559.15 565.52 A: well you know what you don't you know what i'm not religious either i don't believe in religion organized religion 

565.55 568.77 A: but i believe in having a relationship with god 

565.75 568.03 B: i don't believe in any of that 

568.70 572.37 B: i don't so that's not a consolation to me 

569.47 571.43 A: (( you know do you do you )) 

571.75 574.05 A: do you at least admit that he's there 

573.65 576.20 B: no i don't believe in any god 

574.90 576.73 A: well you're an atheist 

576.33 579.21 B: yeah i'm pretty much an atheist but um 

578.01 581.62 A: oh that should be interesting [laughter] 

580.50 581.76 B: but you know 

582.51 593.65 B: with life and everything i think it's all random and i don't think there's a grand plan i don't think there's a puppet master i don't think that there's a reason for everything i think it's just 

591.05 595.81 A: well first of all there is no puppet master because there are no puppets we're not puppets 

595.31 596.82 B: (( it's just it's just )) 

596.21 598.76 A: it's like you said we were given free will 

596.98 599.95 B: random chance that we're just here
