27.14 36.25 B: yeah definitely i know i would [laughter] [noise] [noise] you know and it's hard to remain calm i think when you have kids which are baying on the bathroom door right now but 

30.15 31.17 A: [laughter] 

36.01 40.04 A: oh yes i know i've just walked outside 'cause i've got three of them myself gosh 

36.84 38.63 B: [laughter]

44.52 48.41 A: so you've got the same thing but oh yeah yeah definitely would panic 

45.89 47.59 B: [laughter] 

48.40 55.89 B: yeah it's uh you know i just i hope it never comes down like that it's getting kinda scary lately with everything that's going on in the news and stuff so 

56.21 59.45 A: oh i know i know my brother's over in uh 

60.62 61.44 A: (( kosovo )) 

61.22 63.59 B: oh really oh goodness 

61.88 64.76 A: yeah and uh he's over there for 

64.81 66.38 A: a few months 

65.78 67.03 B: (( oh no )) 

66.64 71.61 A: and yeah so kinda worry about that but yeah we were up in north carolina when the terrorist 

71.75 73.88 A: the uh new york 

73.95 75.37 A: happened 

74.74 75.85 B: okay 

75.43 77.57 A: my husband was in pennsylvania working 

77.28 78.43 B: oh really 

78.35 79.56 A: yeah so 

79.07 80.02 B: (( uh )) 

80.84 87.51 B: yeah that's i you know it kinda hit close to home for everybody you know but just to think of it happening now i mean 

88.02 90.11 B: you know i just 

90.21 94.87 B: i don't know you know it's kind of a touch subject with a lot of people i mean you know it's 

95.33 103.54 B: it's scary you know you don't you know i have a ten year old too or actually he just turned eleven but you know it's i i just kinda don't know how to approach it with him 

103.29 104.33 A: yeah 

103.77 111.37 B: you know i don't want to tell him too much and then have him being scared and then i don't want to tell him not enough and something happens that he doesn't want to do 

111.47 115.38 B: you know but um 'cause [noise] for the most part i mean it's just 

115.54 126.72 B: i'm sure a lot of people would panic and i'm sure a lot of people did with september eleven too but you know um the good thing that came out of it was all the calm people that helped us you know get through it and helped the people get through it you know so 

127.28 130.23 B: i think that situation would take over again but um 

130.27 131.23 B: [laughter] 

131.19 136.71 A: i think in um well especially with september eleventh is you know you're wondering if it's going to happen again 

136.28 137.31 B: mhm 

136.72 140.46 A: and now you know you hit a point where you know where everybody's gotten kind of 

141.49 144.82 A: at ease but then you wonder are they waiting for that you know 

144.45 155.42 B: exactly you know that's that's what everyone says is you know actually i heard it a lot too right after september eleventh was that you know we've got this increased security and everyone is you know 

155.43 163.29 B: uh bracing for another attack and then nothing happens nothing happens nothing happens and then you know the next thing you know we all let our guard down and it happens again 

163.06 164.28 A: exactly 

163.49 168.94 B: you know so it is it is kinda scary to me because i have to wonder what is our government doing you know 

168.92 178.66 B: what you know i always think we sit here and we have no decision you know whatsoever what goes on with our country and the president makes all these decisions and inadvertently it affects all of us 

178.74 192.13 B: you know our freedom is you know as and our safety you know [laughter] it's kinda it's kinda scary when you think about it it's [mn] you know someone's making all these decisions for us but you know if it all comes out wrong in the end you know we're the ones who pay for it 

178.98 179.54 A: (( yeah )) 

191.84 195.14 A: yeah that's true but then you know you think 

192.41 193.31 B: (( you know )) 

195.39 200.80 A: how you know how's he going to try and please everybody and that yeah that one you know 

198.55 200.07 B: (( sure it's true )) 

200.74 201.81 B: yeah 

201.10 206.12 A: that was kind of scary too so it's yeah you really don't have a choice in what's going to happen i mean 

205.57 207.39 B: no i you know 

206.17 209.32 A: if they're gonna do it they're gonna do it what part of the country are you in 

209.07 210.82 B: um i'm on uh 

211.30 212.98 B: wisconsin actually so 

212.59 216.52 A: wisconsin okay i'm down here in florida so yeah [laughter]

224.91 227.41 A: last september the end of september 

227.18 228.39 B: okay

237.57 239.18 A: it's a little bit chilly 

238.71 243.47 B: is it oh yeah well chilly to you is probably you know warm to us over here [laughter] 

242.51 243.67 A: [laughter]

245.57 248.34 B: oh well then you understand so [laughter] 

246.66 254.57 A: yeah but i know that my mom was just up here this weekend and they live down south and they said that down there that um 

252.17 253.15 B: okay 

255.06 262.42 A: two days before the um the attack that there was a house full of um 

258.58 259.41 B: uh-huh 

262.52 264.45 A: (( you know i think it was arabic's )) 

264.68 267.20 A: um that were living there 

267.13 268.29 B: really 

267.26 270.99 A: and um they disappeared two days before that 

269.99 272.25 B: [noise] oh my goodness [noise] 

271.07 280.56 A: and the house has stood empty up until just about a month ago and the people had called and called and said hey these people well they went back to their country 

275.21 276.42 B: oh wow 

280.58 283.34 A: and they were out in the front with or stuff like that 

283.24 296.86 A: and nobody you know not the police nobody bothered to check this house out now they're all over it but [laughter] yeah it's like wait a second guys you know here it is over a year later you know we have this major thing going on and you've got people calling 

288.23 289.78 B: [mn] sure yeah 

296.85 301.19 A: so i'm not sure you know what scares me a lot about terrorism is whether or not 

301.39 304.15 A: you know security is all that 

303.88 304.83 B: sure 

304.60 305.69 A: strong 

305.92 308.05 A: in our country but you know 

307.85 309.19 B: yeah 

308.20 318.52 A: people i know that a friend of ours right after it happened took his aunt and uncle to the airport and he has black hair and he has a beard and moustache and he was out in the sun 

316.01 317.14 B: (( oh okay )) 

318.45 319.55 B: okay 

318.76 327.77 A: he had forgotten his driver's licence here his aunt was in a wheelchair that is like eighty years old was searched they did nothing for him they let him walk right through 

320.71 321.45 B: (( oh no )) 

324.01 325.00 B: oh 

328.35 329.60 B: (( no oh wow )) 

328.38 331.47 A: he said he couldn't believe it [laughter] 

330.69 343.94 B: [laughter] you know i mean that's the scary thing too is you know we like you said about security we have all the security however you know it doesn't take much for one person i mean everyone's human so you know it and it always seems like the wrong people are the ones that get through 

340.82 341.95 A: (( exactly )) 

344.00 344.79 A: (( yes )) 

344.09 350.80 B: you know i mean you hear about people getting on the plane with a gun on accident but you know why does that one person get through 

350.65 351.62 A: yeah 

350.93 354.17 B: you know that it's kinda scary you know you just 

353.66 358.12 A: well you can have all the best security devices in the world it is the people that are running them that are gonna 

356.03 357.15 B: mhm 

358.33 359.33 B: sure 

358.67 359.46 A: (( you know )) 

359.39 360.47 B: yeah i mean 

360.06 361.36 A: whether or not they 

361.47 364.09 A: they are doing their job efficiently 

363.79 365.59 B: er sure exactly 

365.62 376.91 B: i mean you know i'm sure that it's hard for them and i'm su- you know you don't want to i mean you certainly don't want to single certain people out and you know pull over every arabian person or you know indian person anything like that but 

376.90 383.47 B: you know really uh you know really i figure that instinct goes along with that as well as the job you know when you're doing it you just kinda 

383.35 393.66 B: [noise] hopefully you keep saying well some people can sense things when things are not right but you know it just it always seems like the wrong people get you know by with that stuff and it's just you know 

394.08 406.34 B: i don't know it just it just amazes me and i you know it's just it's kinda scary that we have to be so careful today and i mean i'll admit i let my guard down a little bit more than you know it was pretty heightened right after september eleventh but um 

406.49 415.27 B: you know we do as a nation i think we all kinda settle back into our old routine and you know okay this is america no one's gonna come on our land but you know we've seen it happened already so it's 

412.37 413.73 A: yeah 

415.73 417.92 A: (( right sure well one of the hardest things for uh )) 

418.04 421.28 A: to realize about terrorism is that people would do that 

421.14 422.36 B: yeah 

421.30 428.87 A: you know just randomly go about and just kill people and a lot of times you know it's in the name of religion which is bad 

423.78 425.05 B: yeah 

427.48 430.08 B: yeah exactly so you know 

429.14 432.55 A: you know kinda blows my mind that you know people 

432.83 435.97 A: are saying they are killing because of religion but yet they're 

436.09 439.84 A: really not supposed to kill [laughter] well you know 

437.55 443.06 B: yeah [laughter] well you know it's funny you know i mean apparently some people just don't pick up the bible these days but 

442.08 445.28 A: yeah exactly that's yeah and it's just 

444.55 453.40 B: you know and what kind of creator would allow you to do that i mean there is none so even if you had you know fifteen different gods you know i just don't see any of them saying okay 

453.44 455.73 B: fine in the name of religion it's fine 

453.72 454.60 A: (( exactly )) 

455.70 459.07 A: yeah kill off everybody else that doesn't believe in what we believe in 

455.74 456.91 B: (( [laughter] you know )) 

459.89 461.47 A: i mean that doesn't make sense 

461.50 467.49 A: especially with the country that's where you know far away that has no bearing on your situation 

467.16 468.03 B: sure 

467.70 474.16 A: and at that point you know every country should be worrying about their own country and their own people and not worrying about you know 

472.14 473.09 B: yeah 

474.12 484.42 B: well i you know i don't think we need to be sticking our nose in everyone's business i understand we've got to keep our nation sa- i mean we've had people that have wanted to come in america you know and take over for a long long time but 

484.54 491.25 B: you know when you got people who actually have the means of doing it and have actually taken steps to try to you know disrupt our way of life you know 

490.87 492.03 A: (( yes right )) 

491.62 501.58 B: you have to wonder what could be next and you know i guess that's something i try not to think about a lot because with small kids you'd hate to think of you know the worst possible scenario with that but 

501.72 509.80 B: um you know you really do have to kinda prepare yourself and think okay what would happen and it's a shame that they would come over here and attack innocent people 

509.81 517.97 B: where we go over there and we will i mean i know that we've you know entered [laughter] and killed thousands of innocent people as well but when you think about it our job and i think 

517.96 524.93 B: most people in our military have feelings we don't just go over there and kill people mercilessly like they have come over here and done with our people 

525.05 531.41 A: oh they like in this situation i mean the effect it has put on us first the united states 

525.23 526.00 B: so 

530.08 531.19 B: mhm 

531.43 533.58 A: and it's the same when you know germany 

533.81 535.90 A: (( and japan you know )) 

536.83 542.62 A: you're you know you're protecting you're not going on to okay here i am i'm gonna [laughter] 

538.70 539.58 B: sure 

542.67 543.85 A: start you know 

544.55 545.59 A: start doing 

545.60 547.28 B: oh i'm telling you 

547.33 552.97 B: it's just uh you know i just hate to think that our world has come to this and you know 

554.05 556.43 B: i guess it's i you know you just 

555.59 558.83 A: this i you know what i have a feeling it's been like this forever 

558.79 560.49 B: oh sure yeah 

558.97 564.74 A: right from the beginning of time that you're you're you know you just have bigger things to work with 

564.66 565.71 B: yeah 

564.96 567.40 A: and uh scarier things to work with 

567.25 568.53 B: yeah 

567.83 577.59 A: that unfortunately when they started coming up with all these things you know i don't think people thought in the long range like okay if we start making all these bombs and this and that 

577.33 578.27 B: yeah 

577.68 582.00 A: (( you know yeah we're going to be protecting ourselves but can also be used against us )) 

582.74 583.31 A: (( [mn] )) 

582.93 584.16 B: well you know i mean 

584.57 596.32 B: that's the thing you know it's you know i guess in a perfect world there wouldn't be any of that but you know its true you know we build weapons someone else builds weapons you know everyone else builds them and and for our own protection but yeah you know 

596.46 599.89 B: it's almost kinda like you know when someone's storing up weapons
