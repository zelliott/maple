20.27 24.06 B: to me the homeland security act just destroyed all of our rights 

25.73 28.05 B: and it is taking away a lot of our freedoms 

28.22 29.84 A: well where would you go though 

29.68 32.12 B: um canada or europe 

32.54 34.23 A: and where in europe

41.83 42.74 A: britain so 

43.00 44.12 A: kind of varied place 

48.64 49.17 A: oh 

49.77 50.66 B: um 

54.53 55.38 B: (( )) 

55.64 60.15 B: even um you know denmark and that area always fascinated me 

56.95 57.97 A: oh 

59.89 63.29 A: they don't have any homeland security equivalent over there 

63.16 69.15 B: i'm not sure i would have to really look into it but uh the whole 

64.95 65.36 A: huh 

68.52 69.96 A: what you like about 

70.34 70.87 B: pardon 

70.91 73.96 A: well what don't you like about what passes for homeland security 

73.24 84.58 B: well the fact that um phone conversations and everything can be recorded without permission anymore you know i mean it is just 

84.41 87.12 A: you weren't at the world trade center when it collapsed were you 

87.04 88.26 B: no i wasn't 

88.11 89.13 A: oh well 

88.62 91.75 B: no i wasn't i saw the thing i am a new yorker 

91.77 92.21 A: yeah 

92.22 94.44 B: so um 

94.91 102.78 B: i just feel by passing the homeland security after terrorists in effect won by taking away a lot of the freedoms and rights that we held as uh 

103.96 106.34 A: well let me run a hypothetical by you just 

105.83 106.37 B: okay 

106.45 108.91 A: hypothetical suppose 

109.37 110.49 A: as a result of 

111.77 115.79 A: uh you know screening people's phone calls and using this new 

116.35 117.34 A: i forgot the name of that 

117.44 118.17 A: program 

118.35 118.81 A: um 

119.12 121.28 A: was it (( )) not cobra something like that 

121.06 123.70 B: yeah i know what you are talking about 

123.03 124.42 A: and as a result of that 

124.62 125.70 A: the f._b._i. 

126.13 128.23 A: gets wind of a plot to 

129.72 135.32 A: import and exploit an atomic bomb in say new york city or d._c. it doesn't matter where 

135.80 138.32 A: and without that using that program 

138.99 140.12 A: and surveillance 

141.62 143.01 A: it would not get wind of it 

143.94 146.33 A: and by using that program they save 

144.02 144.28 B: w- 

146.60 150.38 A: million lives or so can't predict it would take a few hundred thousand 

150.68 151.45 B: well the thing with 

150.90 152.39 A: is it is it worth it 

152.13 159.10 B: the thing of it is the f._b._i. and the c._i._a. and the government has always listened in and have always gotten intelligence and now they just made it legal 

160.51 163.40 A: so you think that the government has been acting illegally 

165.94 172.35 A: now what is the basis of your belief that the government has always done this without legal authority 

173.91 175.66 B: oh 

174.63 179.29 A: any specific facts that you are aware of or is this just a supposition based upon 

179.84 181.33 B: a lot of this is my own opinion 

182.12 184.33 A: well opinions are usually based on facts 

184.19 185.91 B: yeah um 

185.66 186.75 A: intelligent opinions 

196.63 197.13 B: um 

202.45 203.29 B: the hurt 

203.47 203.93 A: yeah 

204.67 205.91 B: you know of 

205.45 205.87 A: well 

206.16 207.23 B: do when 

206.19 207.47 A: (( )) the way i see it 

208.53 209.34 B: pardon 

208.53 210.62 A: (( )) i'll tell you how i see it 

210.39 211.02 B: okay 

210.98 214.39 A: it is not a question of whether you are going to lose your freedom or not 

214.72 217.77 A: the que- because some freedom under times of 

218.24 218.98 A: threat 

219.29 221.12 A: and there is an undeniable threat 

220.77 221.31 B: mhm 

221.66 223.13 A: is bound to be lost 

223.29 224.78 A: the question is 

225.11 226.17 A: given that 

226.40 232.90 A: who are you going to lose your freedom to and to what circumstances and to what degree 

233.64 235.61 A: and i really don't think that 

236.26 236.84 A: if you 

237.73 239.94 A: if you are insecure 

240.52 243.90 A: and by insecurity in this day and age 

244.04 245.06 A: it may mean 

245.49 249.73 A: getting your family blown up just because they happen to be in a tall building or 

250.62 253.07 A: walking down the street in say jerusalem and 

252.75 253.21 B: mhm 

253.17 254.11 A: they get blown up 

254.32 256.86 A: under those circumstances you are really not free 

257.41 263.04 A: as a practical matter you you are free to do and say things and not have your phone tapped but you are not free to not 

263.45 264.44 A: get killed 

265.25 272.71 A: well what i you know would i give would i chose uh to have that situation or would i chose to have a government which 

273.12 275.30 A: i believe to be generally benign 

275.77 276.55 A: uh 

276.92 279.52 A: listening to some of my conversations 

279.98 280.73 A: uh 

282.07 282.92 A: and then 

283.80 287.73 A: uh take the risk that you know they might mistakenly 

288.17 290.04 A: think that something i said you know 

291.84 294.00 A: can apply in a way which i didn't intend 

294.46 301.94 B: and so you would be willing to sit in jail without being charge indefinitely until they decide whether or not what you said was benign 

301.78 303.20 A: well i don't i 

302.39 304.14 B: on their time table 

303.85 304.26 A: well 

304.50 307.25 A: i don't think i would be sitting in jail because i don't 

307.45 308.79 A: say or do anything 

308.25 309.83 B: uh-huh 

309.27 316.03 A: which would lead anyone to believe that i am a security risk i don't think the government is ever going to throw you in jail because of your 

316.67 318.67 A: political beliefs that is you know 

319.00 324.06 A: are you a republican democrat liberal conservative libertarian communist socialist 

324.70 325.61 A: you know or 

326.03 327.07 A: say buddhist 

327.50 331.25 A: party or what whatever there is but they wo- you know so that doesn't bother me 

331.96 338.28 A: now there are some people who think that you know the government is looking for an excuse to control political fringes and i don't think so 

339.09 341.71 A: i do think though they are looking for people 

342.48 343.97 A: who are plotting 

344.25 345.26 A: you know to steal 

345.41 346.28 A: chemicals 

347.44 349.34 A: uh bomb components 

349.73 352.89 A: in exchange knowledge on how to blow up 

353.77 354.63 A: buildings 

356.52 361.20 A: and i'll take the risk that the government you know would somehow misinterpret what i say 

361.66 362.09 B: mhm 

361.79 363.97 A: but i think that possibility is so 

364.63 368.46 B: well i i can i can understand and respect your opinion 

364.95 365.54 A: (( )) 

365.82 366.57 A: i'll take it 

369.04 371.35 A: oh and i you know i'm going to respect 

370.03 371.36 B: you know 

371.45 372.64 A: you know yours 

372.91 374.56 A: you know and that is what you know makes 

374.62 377.21 B: that is what makes you know that is what america is about 

377.75 380.76 A: that is right and under no circumstances would i say that 

381.17 383.99 A: you know because i disagree that you shouldn't be allowed 

384.23 384.72 B: mhm 

384.23 385.32 A: to say what you say and 

385.53 386.89 A: to try to convince others 

387.48 388.71 A: more power to you 

389.14 390.73 A: because if you believe you are right 

391.46 394.60 A: then you should not be afraid of 

394.81 397.93 A: anyone else convincing the majority that you are wrong 

397.74 398.32 B: right 

398.67 399.10 A: so 

399.30 400.62 A: we can always agree on that 

400.62 401.03 B: mhm 

400.84 401.55 A: (( )) 

402.15 406.06 A: you know and if people you know would take a million dollars or whatever to go 

406.19 406.62 A: well 

406.90 408.35 A: the borders are open 

408.74 409.90 A: at least going out 

410.81 414.51 A: and are they interested to see you know how many people 

414.72 416.53 A: af- after taking such an offer 

416.98 419.35 A: would regret the decision and want to return 

421.34 423.44 A: i'm always impressed by the fact that 

424.05 428.97 A: you see all these people trying to get into this country illegally if they have to 

428.55 429.46 B: mhm 

429.29 432.47 A: and at the risk of their own life and the lives of their families 

432.91 436.28 A: but you don't see any people trying to get into 

436.64 437.06 A: you know 

438.15 440.89 A: russia or north korea or cuba 

440.95 444.59 B: um no but there's other countries that they do try to get into like canada 

445.33 445.77 A: yeah 

445.75 449.24 B: you know for instance i only live thirty miles from the canadian border so 

449.40 452.11 A: i used to live not too far from canada 

451.56 453.77 B: yeah um so 

453.49 456.12 A: it is a lovely place i have nothing against canada 

455.53 463.69 B: yeah oh yeah it is nice um you know i i have to say i love my country it is the government i don't trust 

456.94 457.25 A: yeah 

463.58 464.03 A: right 

464.23 468.09 A: well it is it is healthy to not entirely trust your government 

467.47 471.09 B: mhm 

468.50 473.62 A: because that is what keeps the government largely and i undermine largely trustworthy 

472.52 475.02 B: right 

474.55 475.35 A: uh you know 

475.49 478.10 A: felt you know the price of freedom is eternal vigilance 

477.92 478.80 B: mhm 

478.64 480.86 A: and a healthy lack of trust 

481.87 483.19 A: is part of vigilance 

482.99 483.44 B: right 

483.85 485.04 A: on the other hand 

486.34 487.65 A: it is somewhat 

489.67 493.53 A: well i think that y- y- you set yourself up for a lifetime of unhappiness 

494.00 494.61 A: by 

494.72 495.55 A: always 

495.70 497.24 A: being distrustful 

497.74 499.42 A: of of government 

500.00 501.15 A: which is 

502.81 506.75 A: chosen democratically you know perhaps not entirely fairly 

506.86 509.00 A: of course of and of course of money and so forth
