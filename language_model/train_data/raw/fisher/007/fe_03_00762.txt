10.63 13.40 A: um my answer would be no on that obviously 

13.77 15.10 B: right um 

15.87 19.41 B: and now what are they talking about like uh in a court case do you think or in 

18.96 21.17 A: um i would imagine 

20.91 22.38 B: right right 

22.76 23.93 A: you know or any other um 

24.07 25.28 A: you know situation 

25.55 32.65 B: yeah any other situation you know maybe i would terrible to say but maybe for a family for a family member 

36.16 37.93 B: oh me neither you know 

40.53 41.01 B: right 

46.63 47.43 B: oh yeah 

48.78 52.61 B: that is true though i'll tell you you can not lie because it is always going to effect you 

53.27 53.92 B: you know 

55.39 60.23 A: i'm here with you um i'm in the middle of baking a cake so but i still have you uh on the line here 

59.60 60.14 B: oh okay 

60.76 69.38 B: now what uh -cause i know we uh kept getting the phone calls but are we just supposed to say our answer and then hang up i mean how does it work we never uh you know really uh they never explained to us 

75.59 82.52 A: um i was able to receive i know they called at least three times during the week and um i just realized that every time i was picking up saying hello nobody was there so i would hang up 

82.61 83.35 B: yeah 

83.02 86.51 A: and then realizing that you have to pretty much stay on the phone for at least a minute or so 

88.06 91.69 A: you know before the recording comes on 

91.19 92.78 B: oh okay yeah 

92.89 93.41 B: yeah 

93.88 94.63 B: um 

94.68 96.55 A: now is this uh this is your first call also 

96.91 99.56 B: no they called me like three other times and we just 

99.72 105.61 B: uh said our answer and we didn't know if we then just hang up or what you are supposed to do from there you know 

105.60 111.22 A: well they um from what i was told uh from people that i've been reading from on the uh internet um 

117.92 120.01 B: oh see we didn't know that 

118.05 124.66 A: so i guess the ones that you might have done uh you are probably not going to be paid for because it wasn't for the exact uh ten minutes that you are supposed to stay on 

124.66 127.32 B: oh so you are really supposed to talk about the topic for ten minutes 

126.27 127.21 A: yeah 

127.39 130.73 A: um can i ask what um what board that you saw the information on 

130.90 131.81 B: um 

132.03 133.33 B: i it could've been a mystery 

133.46 135.52 B: shopping board possibly i don't 

135.16 137.98 A: oh okay i um -cause i go to a lot of the freebie sites 

138.07 138.95 B: yeah um 

138.45 141.47 A: uh big big savings (( )) and stuff like that so i ended up seeing that 

141.52 145.15 B: well maybe a (( goodies )) site like maybe it was (( goodies )) or something i don't 

144.91 156.71 A: oh i don't know i'm not really um you know aware of those like i said there are a lot of us at home moms who do a lot of surveys for (( money and pegs )) or home with the kids so it helps pay for the bills and um and that is where we got it but um 

151.32 152.35 B: yeah that is me 

155.20 156.95 B: yeah well that is me 

157.15 167.11 A: we'll get back on topic here because uh obviously we are being recorded um uh speaking with that um three years ago my brother was murdered by the mother of three children 

160.69 161.38 B: right 

167.15 168.05 B: oh my god 

173.27 173.68 B: wow 

173.47 175.60 A: and talk speaking about perjury because 

175.91 180.99 A: there was a lot of people in town who knew both of him and her and uh the family members actually tried getting 

181.72 184.66 A: um his friends to get up on the stand and lie 

184.67 185.81 B: see that is terrible 

185.05 185.65 A: for her 

186.22 196.93 A: and i'm saying to myself you know you know you s._o._b. -s if this were to ever happen you know i mean i i would love for them to all get caught but you know it didn't end up going to trial because she would have gotten forty years plus for it 

197.37 198.82 A: and um 

197.67 200.72 B: terrible i mean it should have went to trial i i think 

200.44 202.97 A: exactly but uh this happened in uh pennsylvania 

213.05 215.74 A: uh you know with the system like that i've never been involved with the law in this 

215.84 217.51 A: you know it's been a real eye opener on 

218.19 219.80 A: how things actually work 

219.84 220.70 B: yeah 

220.46 226.81 A: um you know as far as with the judges and the lawyers and the d._a. -'s office and it was a you know it was a terrible experience 

233.64 239.19 A: you know with them to get answers and trying to do everything long distance and me being pretty much the main 

233.65 234.60 B: yeah 

239.60 241.28 A: uh speaker for the family if you will 

241.35 241.96 B: yeah 

251.73 256.61 A: you know it all comes down to you know she knew she was wrong you know she lied about a lot of different things about 

256.75 261.80 A: you know them and their situation how they were blah blah blah and it's like you know -cause i have all the reports 

261.98 262.68 B: yeah 

262.09 266.34 A: you know myself and obviously she had to try and lie 

266.81 272.22 A: you know to try and save her butt because you know it is her word against his and she is here and he is not so 

271.51 272.84 B: yeah right right 

272.97 281.48 A: you know and it is just you know a shame that you know number one that it happened and number two to sit back and to see all the lies you know that having going around with the situation 

278.54 279.34 B: i know 

282.50 288.54 B: see i know when they first asked the question you know when they just said to me i had to think about i really just had to think about it -cause i'm thinking well 

289.33 296.41 B: i've got to think about the situation you know what i'm saying but if it was something like uh you know to the degree of like you are saying god forbid 

296.58 301.98 B: i knew if somebody in my family killed somebody i could never lie to cover that up you can't i mean
