0.77 1.67 B: hi i'm pam 

2.14 3.24 A: hi i'm laura 

3.26 4.47 B: hi laura how are you doing 

4.54 6.65 A: not too bad how are you 

5.82 10.42 B: good good ah so ah our topic is would we commit perjury 

10.61 15.20 B: i would say for a friend a best friend my answer would be no 

10.87 12.55 A: yeah 

15.71 18.66 A: really never you like think you would never ever do it 

16.31 16.80 B: yeah 

18.81 24.30 B: well it depends all right i should say never ever it depends on upon the situation what arises 

24.48 26.63 B: what would be a hypothetical thing 

24.69 25.54 A: yeah 

26.43 29.64 A: well i mean i think there's are a couple of different issues i mean 

29.91 35.39 A: i think normally most people would say go to this then it when it came that time for them to actually go 

35.65 39.13 A: you know and take the stand and say yes my mother killed somebody 

39.28 40.62 A: that would be a little bit harder 

47.07 48.38 A: well 

47.57 53.49 B: family member but he is saying a friend and it has to i mean murder if you know your best friend murdered somebody 

53.92 54.81 B: what would you do 

54.14 54.62 A: mhm 

55.45 63.97 A: well i think i mean that's a good question like did they murder somebody or did they just like steal something right so i mean if you go up there and say that they did it are they getting you know 

64.10 69.11 A: the death penalty or are they going to go to jail for two years or are they you know just going to get you know a slap on the wrist 

79.50 80.96 B: the women ran over her husband 

82.02 82.87 A: oh on purpose 

82.94 88.10 B: on pur- well she is claiming now it wasn't on purpose that she ah 

88.56 89.50 B: didn't see him 

89.64 90.76 B: but prior to that 

90.86 96.60 B: her daughter was in the car and said that the mother saw the father there and ran him over purposely 

96.41 97.00 A: wow 

96.74 104.81 B: now she confided in her best friend and her best is taking the witness stand and insisted that ah 

105.45 108.68 B: she didn't kill him purposely it was an accident it was an accident 

109.24 111.27 B: they want to know who's telling the truth 

109.58 110.36 A: oh 

111.77 113.56 B: now they're best friends 

111.79 114.13 A: right is it the daughter or is it the friend 

124.11 127.54 B: i i i just it we- i went crazy and i hit him with my car 

128.02 129.79 B: and now i got caught would you lie to (( )) 

128.14 128.69 A: right 

129.96 133.28 B: put me on the stand and say that i didn't hit him i was a good wife 

133.60 134.49 B: what would you do in 

133.95 138.29 A: i i mean so that's the question right i mean are you are you lying because 

138.54 139.19 A: you think 

139.31 150.26 A: you know your friend did it but you don't want them to go to jail anyway or do you think maybe that like they were justified because you know say the guy is abusive right and like she's afraid of him and like thinks she might die if she doesn't kill him 

142.12 142.53 B: right 

150.86 151.55 A: i mean 

151.88 153.11 B: yeah i know 

152.06 156.62 A: in that situation are you really going to tell the person say that you think the person should go to jail 

163.10 163.74 B: all that 

163.49 164.07 A: right 

170.10 171.20 B: nobody 

175.13 175.45 A: right 

175.82 176.73 B: right about it 

175.86 179.55 A: like if you if you feel that justice has been served by what your friend did 

179.34 180.36 B: exactly 

179.73 181.16 A: and like the guy deserved it 

181.33 183.05 A: then you don't want your friend to go to jail for it 

183.01 190.56 B: no and no one with society today they don't look high upon women anyway they they do you know how many people have court orders against their 

190.67 199.90 B: husbands and things all the shows i watch on t._v. it's amazing and then these men still uh slip through the loops and get to the women so 

199.57 202.80 A: right well exactly i mean it's possible even 

202.91 208.21 A: regardless of how she tries to involve the law that she could still be in danger and really there was nothing else that she could do 

208.07 208.86 B: right 

208.35 208.61 A: (( )) 

208.81 209.34 A: but of course 

209.49 210.04 A: i mean 

210.33 214.76 A: if you decide to go on to the stand and perjure yourself you put yourself in danger too right 

214.21 216.19 B: of course of oh yes you do 

215.24 216.06 A: so that's the 

216.69 225.76 B: you have to decide is it worth my risk of also now i'm perjuring myself for this person do i want to go to jail if i get caught 

216.87 217.51 A: exactly it's 

218.28 218.80 A: mhm 

224.09 224.66 A: mhm 

226.02 232.21 A: right so i mean it's just a moral issue like is it right to perjure yourself or whatever you still you're taking on a certain amount of ri- 

228.35 229.49 B: and doesn't look good 

233.14 233.49 A: and 

234.51 237.17 A: i mean i guess both of those are pretty significant factors 

237.46 237.94 A: you know 

237.51 238.19 B: yes 

238.80 242.61 A: and i guess maybe it also it also depends like how likely it is you think you're going to get caught 

238.88 239.18 B: i've 

243.32 244.07 B: that's true too 

244.46 247.50 A: you know i mean if it is something that somebody could prove wrong 

244.48 249.95 B: but if we're talking if we're talking about other than a murder trial we're talking about a different situation 

250.27 250.87 A: mhm 

250.66 257.65 B: about spousal ah in like in a divorce court or something then i don't know if i would feel so bad 

257.67 260.26 A: right well right so it's like is it that important 

257.86 261.94 B: because we're not condemning anyone to their life or anything 

262.33 262.73 A: uh-huh 

262.53 270.08 B: i'm not the one putting the finger out and saying all right now you got to get the death sentence or something in divorce court i wouldn't mind as much 

268.31 268.66 A: mhm 

270.90 273.50 B: because i know we all exp- well i thank god 

270.99 271.38 A: yeah 

272.91 274.84 A: well are their witnesses in divorce court 

275.09 277.54 B: ah i haven't experienced it 

277.96 280.08 A: me either (( )) 

278.16 284.61 B: so i don't know i am married (( )) never went through it i i i guess i mean 

285.08 286.48 B: you go 

285.38 287.49 A: maybe like character witnesses or something 

287.70 296.40 B: well it depends upon if we're going for outstanding amounts of money you know it depends upon the wealth of the thing if you are just going to a simple divorce no 

292.43 292.98 A: uh-huh 

293.64 297.78 A: right like if you have to try to prove like that somebody was cheating on you or something 

297.24 300.77 B: right if you're if somebody's ah contesting the divorce 

300.99 301.86 A: right right right right 

301.20 301.73 B: yeah 

302.15 312.33 B: then they might need ah you know to go to court and things it like it all depends upon the money i'm looking at the money end of it or the custody of the children too which is an important factor 

309.01 309.29 A: huh 

310.92 311.37 A: uh-huh 

311.47 312.51 A: right so i guess if you 

312.69 313.09 A: mhm 

313.35 320.92 A: if you're them on (( )) you're trying to get the kids you might need to prove one or another that like somebody is a bad parent of cheated on you or whatever 

320.09 325.51 B: right okay now here w- in court if would you perjure yourself if you had to go 

336.68 340.99 B: things like that and the mother only tries and tries but she has been abused over the years 

337.86 338.25 A: mhm 

341.16 342.12 B: but he works 

342.31 351.02 B: she doesn't and in the court's eye he makes money and she's not and he could support those children better than she can who gets the children 

349.16 349.60 A: uh-huh 

350.76 356.58 A: well in that in that case though you would hope that by telling the truth you would get the kids into the right place right i mean if you 

356.14 356.47 B: oh 

356.73 358.41 A: if you take the stand and say the guy is 

364.49 366.40 A: yeah so i mean i would say like i would 

365.63 366.50 B: all right let's say 

366.61 370.95 B: both parents and this is hypothetical both parents 

368.36 368.80 A: yeah 

369.97 377.57 A: right i wouldn't i wouldn't perjure myself you know if i had if i had the option of telling the truth and it would come out the same way i guess you only really deal with it if like 

371.89 373.94 B: or alcoholics or something 

378.12 380.02 A: you you feel like the court won't see it 

380.17 381.33 A: the same way you do 

381.36 382.30 B: right 

383.12 383.86 B: (( )) 

383.53 385.18 A: so that's kind of a little bit different 

385.26 386.83 B: right 

387.15 388.07 B: i was just 

387.60 393.87 A: if you if you like know someone did something wrong and you want to see them get locked up you don't have to perjure yourself you just you know 

391.74 393.15 B: oh yeah no 

394.37 400.44 B: i know (( ha- )) i mean (( i'm haven't formed a lot of answers )) have you ever done any of these bef- this is my first telephone survey 

394.41 394.88 A: have been 

400.21 401.76 A: yeah no i haven't done one either 

401.78 403.03 B: oh this is your first one too 

403.44 404.14 A: yes 

403.91 405.47 B: oh all right cool so we 

404.56 414.53 A: so i don't really know exactly what you're supposed to really talk about because like it's not i mean sure it is a hypothetical situation but still how much can you possibly have to say about perjury i mean 

414.18 419.52 B: i don't know but just got to go for ten minutes talking about hypothetical situations it's all i know 

415.04 415.49 A: ah uh 

418.44 420.80 A: right well it's kind of funny actually the whole thing 

420.87 425.71 B: it is is where did you get the name off of ah to call for the program 

421.57 421.85 A: i 

426.39 428.31 A: um somebody sent it to ah 

428.44 429.53 A: like ah a l- 

429.65 432.17 A: an email list that i was on and it seemed like you know 

432.07 434.65 B: oh yeah same thing with me same thing with us 

432.58 433.79 A: it'll be fun and 

435.63 439.53 B: that's how i did it too through inter- through the internet and everything 

439.64 444.91 B: so and then i heard the they said also you know after we talk about it for ten minutes there will be a recording 

444.30 444.60 A: uh-huh 

445.03 448.77 B: coming on so we have to talk about let's think of another situation 

448.29 450.11 A: perjury that's (( difficult )) 

449.05 451.61 B: perjury okay what how else would we p- uh 

451.83 455.30 B: want to help our friends with perjury (( that sounds )) (( )) 

460.52 465.29 B: oh see now i heard it for yourself oh no they didn't say it for yourself they said it for your friend 

464.51 467.62 A: right so if it's just for like your friend or your family member right 

467.94 469.13 A: that's sort of i mean that's 

469.39 472.21 A: is a totally different situation than if it's for yourself like 

472.23 472.77 B: right 

472.45 476.76 A: i think almost everybody actually probably would perjure their s- perjure themselves like 

475.43 483.48 B: that's called the white lie isn't it everybody does that you're right everybody does i mean at one time in life or not 

477.27 477.80 A: right 

480.07 482.64 A: who who wouldn't lie to save themselves 

483.10 487.65 A: especially because i guess that like eliminates the problem of taking on the risk for yourself because 

487.25 488.79 B: right that's true 

487.95 494.03 A: if you're in court already right you already are in trouble right you're in a bad situation so it's not like you can make it worse 

494.31 495.55 B: right that's true 

495.10 501.44 A: well i guess it depends how bad of a situation you're already in but it's it's not likely that perjuring yourself will make it worse 

501.75 502.42 B: no 

502.27 502.65 A: so 

502.83 511.00 B: no no if you're already in a terrible situation
