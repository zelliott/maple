21.11 25.92 A: so we are supposed to talk about what we think about bioterrorism and what the u._s. could do to stop it 

26.62 26.94 A: right 

27.23 28.71 B: right 

27.78 28.83 A: you go first 

29.88 32.61 B: you want me to say my opinion 

32.32 32.87 A: yeah 

34.06 35.83 B: to stop terrorism 

35.65 36.52 A: bioterrorism 

36.98 40.04 B: bioterrorism oh boy 

40.91 41.94 B: that is a good question 

42.65 44.92 A: i don't i don't think there is anything they can do to stop it 

44.58 47.16 B: i was going to say that is a good question 

47.41 48.61 A: i think that uh 

57.05 57.45 B: right 

57.41 58.36 A: and um 

60.34 62.00 A: i've seen all my life that 

63.09 68.87 A: people like like what happened right after nine eleven everybody was on guard about every little thing and i knew that it was going to 

69.18 73.18 A: everybody would get back to normal and not be nice to each other again and everything like that 

72.23 73.04 B: oh yeah 

73.26 73.78 B: oh yeah 

73.52 75.85 A: and it it's the same way with anything 

77.64 78.84 A: stop and realize that 

79.38 80.13 A: at any minute 

80.31 83.65 A: something can suddenly happen that changes your whole world and turns it upside down 

83.46 83.90 B: right 

89.12 89.57 B: yeah 

89.58 92.08 A: you know we don't have to watch out for that they can't 

91.45 92.15 B: yeah 

92.42 94.64 A: and and they probably have enough 

99.09 99.60 B: right 

99.59 102.85 A: and uh i don't have much faith in what the government 

103.04 104.84 A: can do or is going to do or 

105.19 107.33 A: is willing to do or even consider 

108.32 108.72 B: right 

109.20 110.20 A: so how do you feel about it 

110.41 113.17 B: the same um 

114.47 115.13 B: i'm not too 

116.60 118.56 A: well i don't think anybody is 

118.55 120.42 B: no ah the way it is handled right now 

120.66 123.06 A: i don't i'm not i'm not a political person and i'm 

122.73 123.97 B: me neither 

123.33 125.57 A: never paid much attention to stuff like this 

125.97 127.13 A: but and i don't fly 

127.48 130.23 A: um and i never did believe in airplanes 

127.54 127.96 B: right 

130.06 132.40 B: yeah i 

130.42 132.35 A: but um

137.45 137.84 B: uh ah 

137.89 139.97 A: it is a um it is supposedly the 

140.40 140.79 A: the most 

140.93 141.76 A: powerful 

142.22 143.57 A: horrible thing that they can 

143.98 145.66 A: uh i i think it's a gas 

146.10 146.86 B: oh really 

146.18 148.17 A: and um yeah they they uh 

156.62 158.18 B: huh i've never heard about that one 

156.74 157.59 A: and it 

158.10 160.71 A: kills you almost instantly i guess it um it affects 

160.84 162.46 A: the uh respiratory system 

162.81 163.78 B: oh my god 

162.82 163.22 A: and it's 

163.41 165.24 A: very very painful and very sudden 

172.38 173.23 B: oh my 

173.59 174.65 A: and i and 

175.11 176.81 A: i would think that they are probably 

177.58 178.28 A: developing 

178.38 181.48 A: a lot of that and they are going to release it someplace here like a big mall 

181.70 182.18 B: uh-huh 

181.98 182.42 A: or 

183.61 186.19 A: i don't know i worry about it but you know i figure 

186.74 190.99 A: i'm i'm spiritual and i believe that once we go we are someplace else anyway 

190.32 192.69 B: that's me too so i agree 

191.58 193.56 A: so you 

192.93 194.97 B: we have a lot in common (( )) 

194.72 196.23 A: sure sounds like it

200.73 204.12 B: are you really i told you we had a lot in common 

201.41 202.27 A: i 

203.33 211.25 A: you know and it's it's random too -cause i thought that they were going to try to match people up with either similar or conflicting uh people but it is all random they told me 

210.38 210.77 B: uh-huh 

211.46 212.61 B: oh really this is first 

211.92 212.46 A: in fact i

443.59 444.04 B: uh-huh 

443.66 445.84 A: on the on it was on the fifth of july 

446.23 451.75 A: and i wouldn't go because it was on the strip and it was the day after the fourth of july and i thought if they are going to do something 

448.50 449.52 B: oh yeah 

451.99 454.87 A: and they don't do it on the fourth of july they might wait -til the fifth 

452.14 453.02 B: yeah 

454.93 456.05 B: yes that's 

455.25 458.20 A: and i and it was bioterrorism i was mostly afraid of 

458.32 458.84 B: yeah 

460.62 462.18 A: i had heard that they had uh 

462.59 465.54 A: they had made diagrams of the m._g._m. grand hotel 

464.86 465.86 B: oh 

466.15 467.88 A: and that is one of the biggest ones on the strip 

467.76 468.53 B: oh yeah 

468.65 471.92 A: and um they had diagrams of the whole place and i'm thinking 

472.00 472.74 B: oh 

472.78 475.24 A: that is where they are likely to put something through the ventilation sy- 

475.38 475.86 A: system 

475.79 476.30 B: yeah 

476.37 480.10 A: and so i get very uh uneasy now on the strip and 

480.39 482.73 A: well when you live there you don't go there very often anyway 

482.27 483.57 B: right right 

485.03 491.21 B: yeah i worry about chicago i said i'm about about three hours away four hours i'm like chicago is a big town though 

488.13 488.56 A: mhm 

490.98 492.71 A: yeah but why would they pick chicago 

492.49 494.99 B: i don't know that's what who knows 

494.41 495.77 A: i i guess only if they are looking 

495.87 497.89 A: to hit big big cities with lots of people but 

497.10 497.56 B: yeah 

498.21 500.20 A: chicago wouldn't seem to be on their list of a 

499.55 501.06 B: i wouldn't think so you know 

508.20 509.40 B: all over again i'm like 

516.81 518.52 B: (( school )) uh not like a university they'd 

518.96 525.55 B: set off firecrack stuff and boom and they they thought it was the worst i said oh no not again i mean they freaked out
