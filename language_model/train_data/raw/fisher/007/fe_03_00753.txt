14.48 16.00 A: and the question 

16.21 19.01 A: is ho- what's [sigh] 

19.15 22.96 A: what's the cut off point for on acceptable humor 

22.39 26.04 B: (( yeah er )) 

26.48 31.08 B: (( i don't know that could be very different for each person )) 

35.16 35.73 B: (( [sigh] )) 

35.18 39.98 A: yeah um i'm trying to figure out exactly what th- what they mean by this 

36.28 37.41 B: [laughter] 

39.55 40.52 B: yeah 

41.35 42.43 A: um 

42.93 44.77 A: i guess it's you know 

45.64 52.18 A: how you know how dirty a dirty joke is too dirty or or how racist or you know 

50.12 51.48 B: yeah 

53.02 56.09 A: is it okay to tell polish jokes or or 

56.42 58.45 A: should you be politically correct 

59.15 61.61 B: yeah 

61.62 63.30 B: around those lines but 

63.97 66.89 B: how to tell ah 

67.47 70.34 B: i really don't know that one [laughter] 

70.09 74.66 A: well i mean if a person says that's not funny that's probably a dead give away 

74.15 76.01 B: yeah 

75.17 76.19 A: (( [sigh] )) 

77.34 80.79 B: cause sometimes you sa- you might make a joke 

81.36 85.89 B: that seems funny to you and it's funny to everybody else but somebody just takes it the wrong way 

85.70 87.07 A: yeah 

89.86 92.62 A: and then you stand there feeling stupid 

92.23 94.22 B: [mn] yeah [laughter] 

94.46 95.64 A: um 

97.70 103.16 A: i guess if you don't know your audience it's it's probably best to stick with really safe jokes 

104.01 111.07 B: yeah if you know who you're talking to you're less libel to put your foot in your mouth 

111.22 112.17 A: (( mm )) 

114.97 117.59 B: of course even then somebody [laughter] i 

120.00 121.33 A: (( well [sigh] )) 

120.77 128.07 B: don't really think there is a way to cause no matter what joke you tell someone or somewhere will be offended by it 

129.35 139.74 A: [sigh] probably i'm trying to think of the you know the absolute blandest jokes imaginable and they're not funny they're just boring 

140.03 141.47 A: [sigh] so 

141.85 146.27 A: if it's funny it's going to have a little bit of bite to it and that's bound to offend somebody 

145.94 147.93 B: yeah 

150.51 153.23 B: otherwise you tell it and they just sit there and look at you 

153.13 154.46 A: yeah 

155.06 158.91 A: i don't know which is worse if you offend somebody or if they just don't get the joke 

160.86 161.73 A: (( you know )) 

161.55 162.41 B: (( mm )) 

162.68 166.95 B: i'd put a line about even on that one [laughter] 

167.65 171.29 A: and they say huh i don't get it what does that mean [sigh] 

172.50 174.84 B: and then you're trying to figure out how to explain it 

173.87 177.15 A: and the more you try to explain it the stupider it sounds 

176.08 178.16 B: (( yes [laughter] [sigh] [sigh] )) 

183.04 184.45 A: (( [sigh] so )) 

184.09 187.52 B: acceptable or not acceptable how to draw the line 

187.13 188.73 A: mhm 

190.91 192.48 A: (( like ah you know )) 

193.91 196.58 A: do i te- tell the joke about 

197.13 199.19 A: how men are stupid then 

199.45 200.87 A: does that offend you 

200.83 202.84 B: [sigh] it wouldn't offend me but 

202.31 208.09 A: i mean like what a- what are the jokes like how do you get a man to exercise put the t._v. remote on the floor 

208.47 209.74 B: mhm 

209.14 211.86 A: um you know if you told a 

211.99 214.01 A: dumb blonde joke or something 

213.71 214.82 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

214.29 215.48 A: (( you know hm [sigh] )) 

220.74 225.33 A: (( maybe we should just fill our ten minutes by telling [laughter] dumb blonde jokes and light bulb jokes )) 

224.92 226.41 B: [laughter] 

225.61 228.53 A: (( [laughter] you know [laughter] )) 

228.70 234.61 A: or the most offensive things we can th- the jokes we can think of and say why we shouldn't tell them [laughter] 

233.73 235.35 B: [laughter] 

235.37 237.06 B: (( oh yeah )) 

236.66 239.49 A: i mean we are getting paid for this [laughter] 

238.07 239.06 B: yeah 

241.05 242.51 B: i mean ah 

243.01 252.66 B: like tonight i was driving down the road happened to a mail box jumped in front of me see i think that's fairly funny [laughter] 

252.25 253.13 A: (( mm )) 

253.90 254.99 B: hit the mailbox 

254.41 256.51 A: i had a tree jump out in front of me one time 

257.18 259.35 B: i don't like it when that happens 

258.65 261.36 A: [sigh] no no the car doesn't like it either 

263.99 266.57 B: [mn] at least we know where to draw that line 

266.10 267.18 A: yes 

269.84 272.44 A: [laughter] i don't think anybody would find that offensive 

272.53 276.89 A: you know th- they might find it a little bit old fashioned but not offensive [sigh] 

278.35 281.32 B: unless they have some kind of phobia of mailboxes 

283.64 286.63 A: [laughter] 

286.56 290.34 B: they had a mailbox fall over and hit them on the head as a child 

293.85 295.94 A: or they're a postal employee 

296.66 298.76 B: (( [laughter] that's even worse [laughter] )) 

300.16 303.45 B: i make postal employee jokes a lot because 

303.94 307.34 B: i know someone who's mother works in the post office 

307.88 311.41 B: she doesn't like it very much when i make them [laughter] [laughter] 

311.58 316.66 A: my dad used to work for the post office and he used to tell post office jokes [laughter] 

320.10 321.21 A: and also 

321.55 326.57 A: really offensive ethnic jokes usually that he'd been told by somebody of that ethnicity 

326.49 327.68 B: mhm 

327.12 332.83 A: you know a j- joke that insults jewish people would be told by a jew [laughter] 

332.16 333.12 B: mhm 

334.63 337.39 A: they they tend the people tend to tell 

337.54 339.72 A: the worst jokes on themselves 

340.17 341.06 A: (( you know )) 

340.67 342.54 B: yeah 

346.08 350.30 A: which is why eddie murphy is why some people think eddie murphy is funny 

350.47 351.90 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

351.37 352.65 A: (( [sigh] )) 

355.96 358.81 A: i don't tend to go much for comedy myself 

360.01 360.91 B: (( mm )) 

361.81 363.50 B: i like it a little bit 

363.13 364.03 A: (( an- )) 

365.25 367.97 A: most of the jokes that i i like tend to be 

368.74 370.27 A: bad puns 

370.32 374.01 A: or things that are just so off the wall that that people go 

374.26 377.58 A: that wasn't funny wh- what [laughter] 

377.00 378.61 B: (( yeah )) 

379.05 383.39 A: but i- i've i've been told all my life that i have a weird sense of humor 

384.46 390.22 B: i kind of like the stuff that's more like along the edge cause it seems more it seems just funnier 

390.33 394.49 A: yeah i mean there's a whole psychology of humor thing 

394.63 397.86 A: and what makes something funny is that 

399.13 401.06 A: it's actually painful 

401.61 404.91 A: but we laugh at it because it's not happening to us 

404.22 405.10 B: uh-huh 

408.90 413.12 A: so an- to to be funny humor has to be a li- little bit 

414.30 418.49 A: little bit offensive or or there's just nothing humorous 

418.19 420.07 B: yeah 

419.33 420.53 A: (( you know i mean )) 

420.60 421.68 A: (( wh- wh- )) 

421.76 423.14 A: why why 

423.85 428.86 A: the olden silent movies why was the classic joke the guy slipping on a banana peel and falling down 

429.03 430.85 A: what's funny about falling down 

431.52 433.09 B: because it's somebody else 

432.69 435.27 A: yeah it's funny when somebody else falls down 

434.79 435.97 B: yeah 

435.30 440.76 A: it's not funny if you're the one that falls down and lands on your behind that hurts 

440.51 442.08 B: yeah 

441.72 442.63 A: but 

442.80 445.27 A: watching somebody else fall down is funny 

447.65 455.09 B: [mn] or like a joke you know the old jokes where people say you know like a priest and a rabbi goes somewhere 

454.82 456.03 A: (( [laughter] )) 

455.23 459.10 B: it it just doesn't make sense if you just say a person and a person 

458.59 459.49 A: no 

461.15 463.00 A: and if you say you know a a 

463.13 468.16 A: a a priest a rabbi and a cowboy you know you're going to wind up in- [laughter] insulting 

468.35 473.10 A: (( catholics jews and cowboys [laughter] [laughter] )) 

470.12 471.19 B: uh-huh 

477.59 481.11 A: yeah i'm sure that if you told a joke about a duck 

477.73 478.57 B: (( mm )) 

481.18 482.07 A: (( you know )) 

482.45 484.93 A: somebody who loves ducks would be offended 

484.61 486.30 B: yeah peter would be on you 

486.29 487.72 A: yeah 

490.18 492.86 A: what- what's that television commercial with the ducks 

493.30 495.02 B: (( a- a._f._l._a._c. )) 

494.45 495.62 A: (( yeah those are )) 

495.19 496.45 B: (( [laughter] )) 

497.41 498.08 A: (( funny )) 

497.62 499.08 B: yeah those are funny 

498.49 499.67 A: (( those are funny [sigh] )) 

502.36 505.94 A: but i'm sure somewhere there's a duck that's offended 

504.60 505.42 B: [laughter] 

510.28 512.39 B: the ducks don't appreciate it [sigh] 

511.91 512.91 A: (( no [sigh] )) 

519.85 525.77 A: you know it's hard to talk about a pre-arranged subject for ten minutes with somebody you don't know at all 

525.26 527.27 B: (( hm yeah )) 

528.08 530.42 B: it is a little bit 

529.67 530.68 A: right 

533.39 534.88 B: especially 

535.19 537.29 B: when something like this [sigh] 

537.40 538.75 A: yeah 

539.75 544.52 A: i mean i'm tempted to just start telling jokes but that's probably not what they want well 

547.32 549.01 B: (( hm )) 

552.10 558.77 B: what is acceptable joke and what is not what what's the line between acceptable and not acceptable 

563.14 566.50 B: er i was about to say basically something that would offend somebody 

566.95 568.43 A: yeah 

569.60 573.80 A: you know i think everybody has a fairly clear idea of what's politically incorrect 

574.60 579.31 B: not like you said it depends on who you're telling it to 

578.32 582.37 A: yeah well i mean if if you know you're among friends that aren't 

582.59 584.43 A: going to take it personally 

584.62 589.09 A: but if you don't know who you're talking to then then you've got to keep it within the 

589.11 590.70 A: politically correct 

591.50 595.82 A: boundaries you know basically the kind of stuff that they print in the reader's digest 

597.04 599.89 B: and you can tell the same you can tell a joke to
