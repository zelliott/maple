11.75 13.38 A: i believe it is perjury 

13.45 24.20 B: yes uh whether either of us would commit it for a family member or for a friend so uh you want to start or would you like me to 

24.33 28.35 A: oh i'm i'm going to hope you have a little experience this is 

28.45 29.50 A: this is my first time 

32.43 34.92 A: no not in perjury 

38.32 38.68 A: oh 

40.78 42.49 B: new to me too but um 

44.15 45.58 B: do a call earlier today 

45.68 46.07 A: mhm 

47.47 49.50 B: and they talked for ten minutes and 

50.08 53.17 B: their time was up so um 

51.36 51.70 A: okay 

53.51 55.50 B: the basically um 

59.20 59.56 A: mhm 

67.95 69.96 B: um 

68.81 69.96 A: sure um 

70.76 72.59 A: um i i would think that 

73.06 76.54 A: ethically morally must of us would say no we wouldn't 

76.65 77.04 A: but i 

77.76 79.67 B: when it comes right down to it 

78.69 82.07 A: what yeah uh sometimes emotion takes over 

84.08 85.24 A: i would still say that 

85.81 87.45 A: on the surface though i wouldn't but 

87.95 89.59 A: until the time really comes it is 

89.82 90.61 A: difficult to 

91.19 92.35 A: be accurate and uh 

93.58 96.19 B: i understand exactly what you are saying i've 

97.13 106.47 B: uh told myself you know i wouldn't do such and such at times and then when the situation came up uh i did otherwise opposite of what i thought i would do so 

107.74 110.40 B: i and i guess it would depend on how serious the 

110.56 111.54 B: offense is 

111.55 111.90 A: mhm 

112.46 118.75 B: and how punishable it would be and and that i am not familiar with i don't know if you are or not 

119.49 121.18 A: no i'm not but i'm 

121.64 123.21 A: i just am fortunate in that 

123.58 124.43 A: my family (( just )) 

124.54 127.90 A: managed to stay out of legal trouble uh um 

131.46 134.72 B: same here dave where are you calling from 

131.94 133.67 A: i 

134.74 136.64 A: i'm in buffalo new york 

136.66 139.00 B: oh i'm in evansville indiana 

139.16 139.46 A: oh 

139.91 142.97 B: so i i've not been to new york but i've always wanted to be there 

147.52 147.89 A: little 

148.57 149.10 A: bit (( )) 

149.20 154.09 A: and on the snowy side i think that your weather is probably a little bit warmer than ours 

154.28 158.02 B: uh we had some snow yesterday but no accumulation 

157.99 158.31 A: mhm 

159.08 160.34 B: but it it is not too bad 

164.20 168.29 B: this is going to be hard to talk for ten minutes um 

168.36 171.27 A: okay i guess we should try to stay on the topic but i don't know 

170.98 172.07 B: absolutely 

171.84 172.78 A: how far 

173.70 174.49 A: can go with 

174.74 175.32 A: um 

181.20 184.18 B: maybe if we can think of some kind of an example 

186.25 188.37 B: i don't know why 

191.84 192.49 A: um 

193.24 194.21 A: say what do you 

194.35 195.34 A: do you have like 

196.15 196.94 A: children 

197.30 199.77 B: uh no mine are all older now 

202.06 203.57 A: children who preferably 

204.26 206.95 A: have more capability of getting into trouble than 

207.34 210.47 A: toddlers um say 

212.69 214.22 A: one of your children 

214.40 216.23 A: got into a traffic accident 

218.85 220.89 A: was uh accused of 

222.12 227.25 B: uh actually my daughter was involved in a traffic accident and um 

228.00 233.74 B: she thought the light was green and the witnesses said it was red and she was involved in that 

233.63 233.90 A: oh 

234.01 234.52 B: um 

235.79 239.16 B: uh but of course when she went to court uh she said 

239.37 244.92 B: um i thought the light was green but evidently it was not because the witness saw it otherwise you know so i must of just 

245.06 247.51 B: you know ran the red light you know 

246.89 247.45 A: okay 

247.59 249.64 A: but were you present at the time of that 

249.62 251.86 B: no i wasn't she was in nashville 

250.11 250.51 A: oh 

251.91 252.72 A: oh 

255.10 256.01 B: but 

255.15 255.46 A: well 

257.03 262.07 B: it it wouldn't have been a case of perjury i mean i believe her that she believed it was that way of course 

260.15 260.49 A: mhm 

264.47 267.18 B: i mean she didn't admit to it because you know 

267.35 272.54 A: well i- i- if she believed it was green why should she admit to going through a red light 

272.05 273.88 B: the witness was a police officer 

273.96 274.33 A: oh 

274.45 277.01 A: you lose 

276.17 280.29 B: right you know uh it was probably one of those just 

280.40 282.40 B: real close changes or something 

286.85 289.28 B: she wasn't penalized for for being honest 

292.44 295.17 A: what are her i mean what what was the outcome of uh 

295.39 297.38 B: um well actually um 

297.98 299.32 B: she you know paid um 

300.93 305.19 B: a fee and then she is on you know if she doesn't have another accident for two years 

308.08 308.45 A: mhm 

310.78 313.20 B: that that is not perjury so i'm not sure 

312.77 313.13 A: mhm 

313.29 314.09 A: no it is not 

313.60 315.66 B: i mean if we could turn that into um 

316.74 318.01 B: an example of that 

319.01 319.28 A: right 

319.64 321.57 A: uh had you been present 

322.65 323.63 A: and 

326.20 327.02 A: you 

328.37 328.65 A: thought 

329.04 335.08 A: that uh perhaps uh it had turned red very quickly at the time she thought it was green 

335.41 336.41 A: do you think you might 

337.35 338.81 A: say well well 

339.14 340.10 A: yes it was green 

341.61 351.73 B: oh i know i wouldn't have she hit another car and that car flipped over there was just there would be no way i could something like that on that instance anyway 

346.59 347.14 A: oh 

357.99 360.25 B: and and i you know i am a 

360.83 363.05 B: basically honest person um 

367.36 370.90 B: i think at times when i you know gone a little white lie route i've 

371.01 372.72 B: end up almost immediately 

373.14 373.94 B: changing 

374.25 377.10 B: um and and admitting the truth you know 

376.90 377.82 A: yeah i i think 

377.40 379.15 B: uh -cause i get so guilty 

379.11 379.50 A: sure 

381.06 386.12 A: i i think for most people it is just instinct it comes naturally that 

387.47 388.75 A: while you would like to help 

389.39 390.14 A: a (( )) 

390.34 390.68 A: out 

391.97 395.18 A: you you know what the truth is and you know the difference from right and wrong 

395.71 396.94 A: and you had to go that way 

398.33 404.23 B: and i guess it really depends on what the consequences are of whether i would even consider it 

404.40 404.75 A: mhm 

408.83 412.30 B: and i'm not talking about for me for the person that i would be considering 

419.37 420.04 A: (( )) i guess 

420.38 421.08 A: most (( )) 

422.38 422.89 A: i have uh 

429.07 430.82 A: (( )) he and some of his friends 

433.34 433.99 A: anybody know him 

435.24 438.56 A: and they and my son has a video camera 

441.04 442.55 A: very foolish and his (( )) 

442.67 446.98 A: the what they did was wrong anyway they they were throwing eggs at houses and 

446.69 449.08 B: oh uh-huh and he videotaped it 

448.04 448.42 A: (( )) 

448.98 449.37 A: uh-huh 

449.68 451.22 B: oh my 

449.69 449.99 A: yeah 

450.73 452.94 A: and (( )) and my daughter thought 

453.05 455.81 A: there was a video of her dance 

456.34 457.17 A: recital 

457.37 459.62 A: and she came across that and we found that 

460.48 465.50 A: and what we did was gather up all of the kids and their parents and we had them 

466.10 469.70 A: go to the homes obviously we had the addresses and they had video of it 

470.40 473.36 A: and admit what they did and offer 

474.26 474.75 A: to 

475.02 476.78 A: make reparations to clean it up 

478.19 480.25 B: oh so you found it immediately then 

478.22 479.17 A: um 

480.33 480.89 A: i'm sorry 

481.10 483.53 B: you found the videotape immediately 

483.57 490.11 A: it was uh a day or two later i'm not exactly sure fairly fairly soon afterwards 

490.43 493.79 A: and interestingly enough they all 

494.48 495.98 A: went to all the neighbors who 

496.28 497.11 A: were victims 

498.13 499.43 A: thanked us for they had 

499.62 504.45 A: and actually thanked the kids too i don't think they realized they went grudgingly 

504.71 509.14 A: and they said no it is not necessary we will take care of it 

512.27 513.70 A: it is not perjury but that is about as close
