24.87 25.94 A: starting a business 

26.12 27.99 B: starting a business well have you thought about ever 

28.13 29.25 B: thought about starting a business 

29.26 30.14 A: yeah i have actually 

30.18 32.02 B: what kind of business would you do would you start 

32.05 34.51 A: um i thought about starting a business 

34.68 36.16 A: doing um 

37.56 38.79 A: like um 

39.56 40.17 A: little 

40.47 42.52 A: little radio broadcast 

42.98 43.63 A: um 

44.39 45.44 A: selling them and 

46.10 47.10 A: uh syndicating it 

47.61 50.96 B: okay like u- um actually doing like a d._j. type deal or 

51.12 53.00 A: no it was like um 

53.58 54.55 A: uh 

54.78 57.76 A: information like it was a fitness training thing um 

58.18 58.73 A: where i 

58.98 61.84 A: did like little interviews it was like a one minute program 

62.06 64.73 A: um where it was like an intro and then 

65.33 69.38 A: uh thirty second commercial or one minute commercial and then one minute of information 

69.66 70.27 A: and that was it 

70.99 72.70 A: and um i actually actually 

71.02 71.58 B: okay 

73.08 74.07 A: proceeded to 

74.41 75.65 A: i took some classes and 

76.05 76.94 A: i learned all about 

77.56 79.25 A: you know starting a business and 

79.83 81.87 A: when i found out how involved it was i just 

81.98 82.50 A: bailed 

82.76 83.60 A: i said forget it 

82.90 83.70 B: yeah i t- 

84.17 88.31 B: it is uh it is kind of the nature of the beast it is like you always it's a little bit more than you 

88.63 90.83 B: when you think it is like you are biting off more than you can chew 

91.67 92.33 B: and stuff 

92.45 92.95 A: what about you 

93.46 96.60 B: um i've actually thought about opening up a business i've talked pretty seriously with 

97.03 98.95 B: um some friends of mine about it 

99.39 102.46 B: um i was a manager at a restaurant for about three years 

103.06 106.36 B: and i was running all the operations and everything and i i thought that i could 

106.83 109.59 B: either open up a restaurant or um 

109.99 114.04 B: that's m- the main bus- like the most plausible business plan that i've had so far 

114.26 114.66 A: mhm 

114.81 118.50 B: um just because either like a just a hamburger joint or something or 

119.00 121.50 B: um maybe brazilian food um you know -cause i'm 

121.59 122.74 B: kind of familiar with that 

123.61 124.20 B: um 

124.61 125.35 B: but uh 

125.67 128.72 B: i've always thought you know about different um 

129.30 131.10 B: options that are available through 

131.60 132.79 B: because of technology 

132.97 134.19 B: like um 

134.55 137.07 B: converting old home videos 

137.48 139.57 B: um from v._h._s. to d._v._d. 

139.93 140.37 A: mhm 

140.58 144.52 B: um but you know and just kind of making a demand for that and and just marketing it -cause 

145.01 148.08 B: as far as the there is not much setup required and and it wouldn't be 

148.48 150.32 B: as involved as others -cause you can let it 

150.87 152.50 B: burn burn the d._v._d. -s on on 

152.93 154.33 B: time that can spend away 

154.52 155.75 B: you know you set it to burn and 

156.51 157.08 B: um 

157.56 159.30 B: you come back like four or five hours later 

160.06 161.59 A: i'm going to switch to a land-line here 

162.03 162.62 B: okay 

162.75 165.38 A: sorry just maybe you can hear that little clicking um 

165.53 167.41 A: do you have all the equipment to do that sort of thing 

167.57 171.64 B: um pretty much i think the only thing that i would need to buy one piece of equipment and um 

172.06 174.54 B: it would probably cost about two hundred dollars or so 

175.22 176.35 B: you know which a- and then 

176.79 178.80 B: you know you can just take it from there and just kind of 

179.38 180.03 B: um 

180.64 183.57 B: it k- at first it would be a small scale operation but then you would have to 

184.18 187.86 B: um upgrade it as you know you get more demands and stuff 

186.84 191.16 A: yeah you would have to add more equipment -cause just doing one at a time wouldn't be 

191.35 193.28 A: wouldn't be 

193.25 193.83 B: yeah that is 

193.42 195.49 A: uh a good use of your time anymore you know 

195.57 196.99 B: no it really wouldn't 

196.84 199.26 A: you would have to do several at once 

198.67 199.14 B: mhm 

200.79 205.19 B: how have you uh what what kinds of ideas have you had about marketing your new product and getting it out 

200.90 201.28 A: yeah 

205.66 207.94 B: um and and getting people to know about it 

208.73 209.66 A: um 

210.02 218.12 A: well for my kind of a product which you know i totally gave up on the idea but um for my kind of a product i would have 

218.60 220.91 A: just pretty much um 

221.67 227.43 A: i had two options i could um locate a a syndicator like westward one or 

227.54 228.60 A: um 

229.00 237.29 A: clear channel you know a big radio broadcasting company or syndicator uh a._b._c. you know somebody huge and offer it to them 

230.39 231.03 B: mhm 

232.22 232.68 B: yeah 

237.84 238.50 B: uh-huh 

237.86 241.49 A: that was an option for marketing another option was to independently 

241.72 246.53 A: contact every single radio station that i thought might be willing to run it that is a big undertaking 

246.32 247.50 B: yeah that would take a long time 

246.74 248.92 A: and the other thing was to get a sponsor 

249.26 257.44 A: to pay for it and then to run it free on the radio stations but that still would mean marketing it to them being making them aware that it was there 

250.70 251.15 B: oh 

257.99 258.47 B: uh-huh 

258.02 258.43 A: so 

258.67 261.26 A: it was all just a whole lot of work that i just 

261.75 264.42 A: you know i was really going to do it and then i just 

265.14 274.66 A: backed out i mean i had everything all set and i just decided no i don't think i want to get in that deep it was something that you were responsible for producing all that stuff indefinitely 

266.29 267.47 B: (( )) out (( )) 

273.79 274.17 B: yeah 

275.25 275.89 B: that is true 

275.98 276.43 A: mhm 

276.40 279.67 B: now where would this wait where would the income come from what would it be 

279.85 282.18 A: well uh probably the best 

280.28 280.73 B: um 

282.29 284.36 A: option would have been to get a sponsor 

284.63 285.11 B: mhm 

284.65 289.61 A: to pay for everything and that would provide the income um if it was 

289.97 290.66 A: uh 

291.08 292.50 A: syndicated by a company 

293.08 294.62 A: it would just be a manner of 

294.83 301.79 A: of having a salary s- (( )) a salary off you know -cause then they would sell it to an advertiser 

301.93 302.47 B: mhm 

302.05 303.24 A: i mean they would do all that 

303.60 304.20 A: um 

304.43 306.73 A: and i would just get a portion of that for producing it 

307.33 307.63 B: hm 

308.12 309.23 A: but it really wasn't 

309.40 309.82 A: you know 

310.15 310.56 B: yeah 

310.31 312.24 A: wasn't to be and so 

311.68 314.77 B: yeah well see uh pro- i think one of the hardest things about uh 

315.19 319.46 B: opening a business is uh well about doing anything new is just kind of that first initial step 

319.98 322.67 B: um and there is always a doubt in your mind and well what if and 

323.32 327.67 B: and uh you know what if you don't make it what if the product isn't selling like i think it's going to 

328.04 331.48 B: or what if people don't like it i mean uh were those some of the issu- things that you 

331.99 334.06 B: thought about when you decided not to 

332.80 339.94 A: well uh well that is what happened i actually took a course it was provided by um it was in chicago and it was provided by a woman 

340.52 345.57 A: uh a new or woman's business owners organization it was a free course 

346.22 353.25 A: i probably went to six or eight classes at night and what they did was they gave you all these tests to evaluate you if you had what it takes 

353.60 354.22 A: to be 

354.81 355.45 B: mhm 

357.41 357.87 B: yeah 

364.35 365.69 A: you know get busy 

365.78 368.65 A: you know and and all the financial things all the 

368.94 370.35 A: the business plan and 

370.71 371.06 A: the 

371.58 371.89 A: just 

372.53 376.76 A: i can't even remember what they are right now they were just so intimidating all that um 

383.95 389.61 A: all that was just like i said really intimidating and you really need to know it for yourself because you can't trust 

389.97 391.07 A: somebody to really 

391.68 398.22 A: be all in the nit gritty of your business you know and and not knowing what is going on you go to know so 

394.57 395.10 B: mhm 

397.46 397.92 B: yeah 

398.80 399.44 A: so i just 

399.90 401.52 A: decided that it wasn't for me 

401.97 402.37 B: yeah 

403.90 408.37 B: no was it after did you just take one semester of of night classes or was it 

403.92 404.58 A: and i 

411.53 412.11 B: okay 

414.91 415.73 B: okay 

415.43 417.41 A: but it was extremely valuable i mean it really 

417.77 418.53 A: ma- i i 

418.69 424.54 A: wouldn't have been able to do it without the course and i think the course kind of weeded me out as being somebody that 

424.90 426.98 A: wasn't going to be able to to do it 

427.09 428.06 A: you know and i probably 

428.73 436.63 A: i wasn't far from it you know i wasn't completely wrong for starting my own business but i think it gave me an idea of how much work it really is and i sort of 

437.47 438.13 A: at that point 

438.49 439.10 A: backed out 

439.19 439.74 A: you know 

440.19 443.51 A: when i realized just how much work it was just how much responsibility it was 

440.37 440.79 B: yeah 

444.12 445.69 A: i decided no 

446.01 446.82 A: don't think so 

446.85 449.60 B: yeah it is a little bit more than what most people think it is 
449.63 450.30 A: mhm 

450.54 452.02 B: and stuff well that is um 

452.92 457.18 B: is that the only idea that you've had for like a product of opening a business or 

456.65 463.10 A: well at the beginning of the phone call when the recording told us what we could talk about my first thought was owning a radio station 

462.87 463.32 B: okay 

463.34 465.19 A: now that i could do and 

465.43 468.09 A: you know if i if money was no object 

468.50 472.45 A: i ab- that i would do it if i had money to spare that's 

472.20 472.88 B: uh-huh 

472.67 477.02 A: that is what i would do -cause i've been working in radio for a long time and i know the business really well 

477.12 478.10 A: and um 

478.61 480.81 A: even even the financial parts 

480.95 481.52 A: you know 

481.80 484.35 A: i could handle that that is different than 

484.73 486.32 A: you know what i was doing 

484.78 485.21 B: yeah 

486.59 490.29 A: before so i think yeah i i would definitely 

490.71 499.80 A: if money was no object that is what i would do i mean you need a couple million dollars to buy one but you know what about you if money was no object 

495.63 496.17 B: yeah if uh 

496.59 497.33 B: no 

499.60 501.50 B: if money was no object um 

502.10 506.12 B: you know what i tell i tell people this is a joke but i think it would it would really be fun would be to go down to like 

506.53 509.62 B: um you know a south american country like brazil or 

510.06 512.89 B: uruguay argentina and sell popsicles on the beach 

513.07 515.05 A: popsicles on the beach 

514.84 517.14 B: because it i- j- y- it would be just so laid back 

517.68 519.19 B: and relaxed and 

518.75 521.27 A: wouldn't there be like a language barrier there 

520.94 522.94 B: well i actually speak spanish and portuguese 

522.24 523.86 A: oh oh there you go
