46.77 48.77 A: not open a restaurant but like a 

50.68 52.73 A: cafeteria type or like 

56.33 58.13 A: some kind of stand that would be mobile 

59.02 62.83 A: some kind of like lunch wagon type thing but i don't know if i could be able to do that 

62.99 66.20 A: but um another idea i had was um 

67.81 72.02 A: i know sometimes they have like little stores in the mall uh that make jewelry and stuff 

72.32 72.57 A: um 

72.37 72.77 B: mhm

74.38 75.11 A: i don't know how 

74.64 75.05 B: like the 

75.15 75.71 B: kiosk 

75.89 76.42 B: type of thing 

76.84 77.61 B: the free standing 

79.38 82.67 A: i don't know how successful a business that would be but i think that would be fun 

83.01 83.78 A: something like 

83.03 83.51 B: uh-huh 

86.18 87.87 A: fashion kind of related 

88.05 88.52 B: mhm 

90.64 90.93 A: but 

91.03 95.34 A: it's uh i don't know if i would be good being my own boss 

96.03 97.25 A: i think that would 

96.49 97.92 B: well i've done that before it is 

98.06 99.44 B: difficult you have to have 

100.91 101.80 B: tremendous amount of 

105.00 105.84 B: uh drive 

111.89 112.40 B: (( )) 

118.72 120.22 B: uh let's see 

123.90 125.83 B: they had mentioned also 

126.84 127.62 B: in the topic 

128.01 130.85 B: topic of conversation how you would go about doing it 

132.00 133.80 B: if money were no object 

136.26 137.60 B: and i guess 

137.69 138.97 B: for me i would 

139.10 139.67 B: um 

142.16 143.61 B: first of all i would probably move 

143.72 144.92 B: to a larger area 

145.14 146.03 B: than i am in 

148.34 150.21 B: population in this area is rather small 

150.79 152.45 B: and i don't believe that there is 

152.70 153.16 B: enough 

153.29 154.08 B: to support that 

154.41 155.27 B: sort of business 

156.05 157.20 B: so i would move to a 

157.32 157.75 B: city 

158.62 159.13 B: uh 

159.23 160.52 B: for example chicago 

164.19 168.60 B: money were no object i would have a location right in the middle of the downtown 

169.76 171.85 B: gold coast area the high end area 

172.89 173.77 B: has a 

175.59 176.77 B: highly visible 

177.51 178.41 B: location 

180.92 181.42 B: have it 

182.62 183.92 B: very very high end 

185.39 185.65 B: that 

185.84 186.65 B: it would be 

188.41 188.98 B: almost like a 

189.58 190.03 B: animal 

190.13 191.15 B: (( )) as opposed to a 

191.27 191.62 B: human 

191.74 192.08 B: (( )) 

193.42 194.57 B: uh areas for the dog 

196.28 197.15 B: particularly dog 

197.53 198.58 B: play and 

199.23 199.76 B: (( )) 

204.16 206.57 B: groomed and manicured and pedicured and 

207.54 209.31 B: (( spa )) for them 

211.34 211.97 B: kind of go 

212.79 213.10 B: full 

213.93 214.75 B: full board on that 

214.94 215.76 B: sort of stuff i 

217.10 217.50 B: seen those 

218.22 218.86 B: places 

221.04 222.84 B: larger cities like new york and 

224.37 226.76 B: and i'm sure there are several in chicago as well but 

230.58 231.57 B: think that would be the 

232.39 233.40 B: my focus 

237.55 238.97 A: i think i might um 

239.96 241.38 A: like if i'm going for the like 

241.52 242.69 A: jewelry making or 

242.79 243.67 A: fashion related 

244.33 244.80 A: type 

246.13 246.82 A: option 

247.18 248.78 A: i think i would go to one of the kiosks 

251.45 252.37 A: definitely talk to 

253.64 254.43 A: working there 

263.64 264.53 A: i have some friends 

265.40 266.29 A: who um 

267.67 269.09 A: have a business of their own 

270.45 271.69 A: would talk with them and get some 

272.19 273.05 A: you know pointers 

277.59 278.20 A: i don't know 

278.64 279.12 A: um 

281.25 282.54 A: as to location 

283.85 286.73 A: my initial reaction was to say like mall of america but 

288.29 290.31 A: again there's so many stores there 

290.54 292.95 A: that i think sometimes people have to be more selective 

293.80 294.88 A: because you know they can't just 

295.18 296.65 A: shop at every store they have to 

297.32 297.80 A: pick 

299.29 299.70 A: go 

301.80 305.32 A: maybe i'd say like a a smaller mall or even like um 

306.20 308.65 A: in the uptown area it is real artsy and 

311.61 312.09 B: mhm 

311.85 314.25 A: probably somewhere like that it would do better 

314.75 315.03 A: but 

314.89 315.29 B: mhm 

315.54 317.21 A: if i was to do it in an area like that i would have 

321.06 321.86 A: yes (( )) 

321.86 322.31 B: right 

321.98 322.52 A: (( )) 

327.82 329.28 A: lots of things to think about 

334.83 335.49 B: um 

338.25 338.99 B: now if 

339.16 339.63 B: uh 

340.35 341.02 B: we're 

342.71 343.52 B: this would be my first 

344.32 344.85 B: chat 

346.45 347.81 B: i honestly don't know if we're 

347.91 348.65 B: supposed to be 

349.22 352.81 B: uh having some other interaction or if at some point 

353.32 354.81 B: we are supposed to get a 

356.62 357.24 B: some sort of 

359.85 362.12 A: yeah like push a button when we are done or 

359.98 360.85 B: uh notice 

361.87 362.59 B: exactly 

362.71 364.34 A: or have them pop in and say 

364.76 365.38 A: okay 

365.50 366.25 A: it's been five minutes 

366.46 367.01 A: (( )) 

367.31 367.71 B: right 

369.71 370.29 B: do you know what the 

370.69 372.42 B: timing is when you say five minutes 

376.11 377.07 B: a little more than that 

377.71 378.31 A: sure 

388.72 390.66 B: well i've received how many have you received 

393.13 394.41 A: calls or e. mails 

394.29 395.17 B: no e. mail 

396.15 398.30 A: um i think just the one 

401.16 402.44 A: or i think one was like 

403.28 404.19 A: send you a pin 

405.76 406.20 B: mhm

453.42 454.32 B: fairly high stressed 

459.46 460.35 B: i'm 

462.08 462.57 B: i switched 

462.70 464.12 B: to this position from 

465.11 465.70 B: my 

465.94 469.40 B: other work where where i was self-employed and i did consulting work 

470.15 473.07 B: which i also enjoy tremendously but 

473.34 476.42 B: when i was doing that i was traveling six months (( to )) nine months at a time 

477.32 478.13 B: and i needed 

478.35 479.82 B: to spend a little more time around home

484.13 484.57 B: spend 

484.74 486.26 B: time at home and

508.62 510.35 B: if i ask in this position
