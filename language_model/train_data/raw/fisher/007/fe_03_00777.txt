30.87 34.16 A: where would you go 

33.45 34.81 B: uh 

35.24 37.54 B: i'd probably go back to australia

44.23 47.13 A: i said everybody wants to go to australia huh 

46.84 54.45 B: well i didn't know if they all do or not but uh having living there for a period of time uh i was very comfortable with 

54.83 55.87 A: (( )) 

55.24 56.91 B: with the country and with the people 

56.02 58.98 A: yeah 

58.57 59.44 B: yeah 

59.82 61.32 B: and 

60.35 62.55 A: (( ))

64.19 66.10 A: (( )) 

64.36 66.37 B: that is that is a great place 

66.26 70.41 A: that is what i was thinking if i had to go i am not sure i'd go though 

70.55 76.10 B: okay that is reasonable i can a- i can accept that 

72.36 73.02 A: (( )) 

75.85 76.91 A: (( )) 

76.44 77.67 B: uh why 

79.16 80.27 A: uh i don't know 

80.53 82.30 A: everybody is coming to the u._s._a. 

83.06 85.24 B: uh yeah 

83.33 84.27 A: (( )) 

84.90 86.97 A: that war going on 

86.65 90.75 B: yeah but it is kind of interesting i mean having 

90.49 91.32 A: family here 

91.72 94.47 B: that is the thing that that was the one (( con- )) 

93.80 96.35 A: (( )) family in australia though 

95.90 98.88 B: and neither do i and neither do i have 

96.85 97.57 A: (( )) 

99.05 100.70 A: (( )) 

99.14 103.03 B: uh family other than in uh essentially italy 

103.40 106.15 B: but the reality is that uh 

106.26 112.51 B: they'll come and visit or you can pick a mutual place and you can connect up there i mean it is 

111.57 113.59 A: unless we go to war 

114.32 116.10 B: uh even if we do 

115.48 120.54 A: and then then then might not have no family left because you went to australia right 

120.75 122.07 B: um 

121.57 123.56 A: that might be the last time you see -em 

124.39 125.98 B: there is always that possibility 

126.20 130.62 B: but i you know you have to work on the basis of probability and not possibility 

131.10 132.03 A: yeah that is true 

132.16 134.94 B: that is uh that would be my contention 

134.63 136.87 A: what would you do with your million bucks after you get there 

137.75 144.94 B: oh i'd do just what i do now i'd invest it in some interesting situations that is all and uh 

144.57 145.96 A: interesting situations 

146.65 148.53 A: what are those 

151.54 152.25 B: (( high )) 

153.16 158.40 B: high risk high yield uh programs that i have been in involved with 

157.45 157.88 A: (( )) 

158.53 158.93 B: for 

159.39 161.04 B: fifteen years or so (( )) 

161.33 165.14 B: but anyway that's is what i'd do that is what i enjoy 

165.34 166.46 A: (( you do )) 

165.83 169.03 B: yup uh and what else what would you do 

169.25 173.80 A: i'd probably stay i don't think i'd go 

174.48 175.51 B: uh 

175.65 177.19 B: okay that is uh 

177.35 178.84 B: so that that would 

178.96 185.15 B: seem to imply i guess that you are pretty satisfied with your with your life here 

185.66 187.71 A: uh yeah i have a lot of family here kids 

186.98 194.63 B: well that is that is like i said that is my concern also i have a lot of family h- you know in the united states and certainly a lot of friends

200.38 204.96 B: that is nice that is what i don't have that is what the 

203.87 205.82 A: i don't think i'd be going to australia with them 

205.62 211.62 B: that is the part that is the part of uh my life i guess that 

211.74 213.45 B: i don't have 

212.06 214.56 A: if i didn't have kids and a family i think i'd go 

214.14 215.49 B: i have no children no

290.52 302.11 B: yeah i've se- i've seen spiders that jump that are poisonous uh i've seen very l- (( )) worms literally ground worms that are twenty feet long and 

302.48 303.31 B: around as 

303.10 304.96 A: twenty feet long ground worms 

304.49 309.43 B: yup and about as aroun- a as round as a rattlesnake actually

310.22 310.80 A: they bite 

311.18 318.14 B: no they don't bite or do anything like that they are just really weird i haven't obviously 

318.30 319.20 B: but 

319.43 326.79 B: they have kangaroos now the interesting i- uh one of the things i'll tell you about kangaroos is they like to sit on the roads at night 

327.58 330.40 B: because the road outside the cities 

330.69 333.99 B: actually absorbs the heat from the sun during the day 

334.16 336.66 B: it gets pretty cold in uh when you are outside 

336.76 337.75 B: city and the outback 

337.72 339.91 A: (( )) 

337.84 338.69 B: (( got a different part )) 

339.56 348.17 B: and they sit on there in groups uh to keep warm and you can be traveling down the road and all of a sudden uh 

348.28 348.83 B: y- you 

349.05 353.51 B: could just run in to a whole bunch of them and it is pretty wild and it happens a lot 

353.18 353.53 A: huh 

353.82 355.60 A: sounds interesting 

353.91 354.82 B: happens a lot 

355.18 356.19 B: it is 

356.39 357.08 B: it really is 

356.58 358.13 A: did you ever see koala beers 

358.34 364.16 B: no not in the not in the wild uh no i never did i i have seen -em 

361.47 361.93 A: no 

364.28 368.86 B: you know in the zoos uh but never in the wild 

365.60 366.97 A: yeah 

381.47 384.61 B: just do what i already do i don't it it wouldn't 

385.10 385.85 B: uh 

385.96 387.01 A: (( )) 

386.67 388.31 B: i suppose 

388.02 388.45 A: (( )) 

389.31 389.72 A: (( )) 

389.52 390.66 B: i would 

391.35 394.74 B: move because i have a pretty 

394.16 394.47 A: (( um )) 

394.82 396.24 A: (( )) 

395.91 396.89 B: global 

397.32 398.30 A: (( )) 

397.45 404.67 B: perspective and i have a lot of friends in other countries because i i have traveled around the world quite a bit 

404.29 404.80 A: (( )) 

405.25 408.02 B: and maybe that is why it isn't 

408.88 411.40 B: as critical to me to stay in the united states 

412.41 414.23 B: i think that is really what it comes down to 

413.36 415.56 A: as yeah you've been around 

416.04 416.59 A: not me 

416.72 419.65 B: yeah uh well actually 

420.17 423.19 B: uh it was something that happened in nineteen 

420.37 420.66 A: (( hm )) 

422.38 422.79 A: (( )) 

423.49 424.67 B: eighty three 

425.73 427.24 B: i got really sick 

427.34 431.24 B: and it didn't look like i was going to survive and 

428.27 428.81 A: (( )) 

431.95 436.42 B: after i did survive i decided uh i wanted to travel 

437.15 437.56 A: yeah 

437.63 441.94 B: so i started to work in the kind of business that allowed me to s- 

442.14 444.52 B: to start traveling which uh 

444.88 446.42 B: was marketing 

446.61 451.19 B: and uh i started to import products from other countries and 

451.45 453.46 B: and that made it interesting 

453.22 457.32 A: yeah i don't know if i had the million bucks i guess i'd i don't know 

454.09 455.13 B: and then 

457.60 458.90 A: i'd invest it and make more 

458.84 460.24 B: yeah absolutely 

460.49 464.44 B: it is fun it is a game that is what it is about you know you don't i- it's not 

463.47 466.20 A: and i'd send it back over to my family probably 

465.95 468.86 B: uh yeah it sounds like a wonderful thing to do 

471.98 473.19 A: (( we can do that )) 

476.37 476.89 A: right 

481.53 482.30 B: you know you could 

490.01 490.87 B: for six months 

490.98 494.44 B: (( )) in milan in rome in london 

493.70 497.24 A: yeah if you didn't have kids it would be easy to do but with kids you can't do that though 

496.73 504.89 B: yeah that is true i keep i keep forgetting that you know you've got those ties i don't think in those terms uh because i don't have that 

505.78 511.35 B: but it is better i suspect believe me to have the children than to have the uh 

512.23 513.23 B: than to have 

513.97 517.77 B: the quote on quote uh flexibility that 

517.96 522.98 B: that i have i uh the children are just that much more important in the long run 

523.26 525.28 A: they i would think so 

524.38 526.01 B: uh yeah and 

525.67 527.71 A: one day you'll probably have it 

526.13 526.81 B: i pretty 

526.98 530.56 B: i'm pretty positive i'm speaking as an outsider on this one 

530.81 531.09 B: but 

531.32 532.44 B: uh yeah
