177.52 178.50 A: me too 

178.63 181.21 B: i don't know if it's going be just the one question or if it's

194.92 197.85 A: that's right that's right 

196.35 201.53 B: like we couldn't come up with ten minutes to talk about all this okay this is [laughter] 

199.57 205.21 A: [laughter] i really can't either i don't enjoy like comedy movies all that much or 

202.65 203.32 B: (( [cough] )) 

204.43 205.72 B: right yeah 

205.78 208.35 A: this is probably not a good topic for me 

207.91 211.34 B: yeah like i like [sigh] it's like 

212.10 216.66 B: (( abo- i i i i like i like i like a lot of british comedy )) 

216.23 217.31 A: (( do ya )) 

216.81 218.93 B: but yeah cause that's because they 

219.49 229.43 B: on on the occasions when i've had access to a television um a proper t._v. station sort of things like they'll show the vicar of dibley and they'll show the um wh- what's that one ca- 

229.69 230.95 B: um 

231.73 236.90 B: the the one the one the one who's name is some song and it's not somewhere in time it's um 

237.04 247.07 B: as time goes by that was it um that that one that one as time goes by is really nice because it's it- it's it's kind it's kind of like a sitcom but it's more intelligent 

238.70 239.92 A: oh 

246.74 247.90 A: oh 

247.57 248.54 B: so 

248.48 259.15 A: yeah i can't i've never seen any of that no is that like comedy like you could watch with anyone you kids or whatever or yeah 

249.64 250.38 B: (( [cough] )) 

250.78 252.31 B: yeah 

256.16 257.28 B: oh yeah 

258.26 259.26 B: (( it's )) 

260.04 263.44 B: like like as as as time goes by it's like you know 

263.66 264.87 B: um 

266.29 267.55 B: it's 

268.05 269.14 B: you know it's 

269.17 272.74 B: kind of it's like it it's aimed at adults 

273.07 287.54 B: it it it's i guess it depends on how like you know if if if you're bothered by a television show where it's like th- th- there's clearly two of the characters are are um are sleeping together and they're not not married then you know 

287.55 294.30 B: that sure is not going work but then most shows aren't going to work [laughter] so but it's really there's not but there's not you know but there's nothing off color 

290.01 291.50 A: right 

293.90 295.53 A: oh that's good 

294.65 295.88 B: (( you know it's like )) 

296.00 309.39 B: it's like a- a- at most they'll be like you know something is like a va- like an illusion and so and it's like if if if if if your mind is thinking that way you might pick up that there's something but [cough] [laughter] 

307.15 308.78 A: [laughter] 

309.61 312.14 B: but if you know it's like if you're not looking for it it's 

312.87 315.21 A: pretty appropriate for anyone then 

313.81 314.66 B: (( you know )) 

315.00 321.93 B: yeah it's like i mean i- i- i'd have no trouble with my with you know watching it with my with my little son in the room so

322.66 323.45 B: so 

323.83 329.30 A: when i think of like british comedy i think i like benny hill that's very off-colored comedy 

326.71 328.07 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

329.01 332.79 B: yeah that's exactly what definitely the adult end [cough]
