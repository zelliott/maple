256.87 262.11 A: it's nice to meet you 

262.77 265.17 A: so you already have your business set up 

264.88 267.51 B: right i've um had it for about fourteen years 

267.86 268.62 A: oh 

268.60 269.78 B: that's my um 

270.03 274.11 B: grandfather started it back in i guess about nineteen thirty one 

274.70 277.35 B: then my parents did it when they decided to retire i took over 

277.66 281.81 A: oh that's not bad at least it was already set up and you didn't have to you know 

281.11 287.56 B: go through all the hea- the heartache of the first yeah i didn't have to start in the corner of a hardware store or anything 

286.63 289.67 A: that's so true oh 

287.98 290.75 B: and yeah so that was a blessing 

290.87 292.21 A: oh that is so good 

294.10 297.51 A: and um it's fine jewelry i would imagine not 

296.99 303.97 B: um you know we're a little bit of everything because how the market here changes depending on the season you know we have everything from 

304.19 308.22 B: twenty five dollar watches to twenty thousand dollar watches 

307.62 308.92 A: oh that makes sense 

316.57 319.14 B: we get a lot of really great estate jewelry that we sell here 

319.48 322.58 B: also on the internet um you know through different jewelry companies 

323.52 324.49 A: oh 

324.06 326.95 B: that go around like from each like estate jewelry sale 

327.80 330.39 A: oh i've never been to one of those estate sales 

330.22 334.83 B: that's beautiful things hopefully some of the pieces are mine 

333.54 340.50 A: and i would imagine in south carolina there should be some good s- estate sales 

334.97 336.72 B: you know 

340.29 342.50 B: yeah there's really nice um 

342.74 344.46 B: it's beautiful stuff 

344.57 347.17 B: and everyone gets what they want you know what i mean 

347.14 348.75 A: makes everyone happy 

348.58 354.66 B: exactly the people who are trying to get rid of it get a fair value passing it on i make a little 

355.35 355.71 B: so it's 

355.82 357.74 B: you know it's beneficial for all 

358.92 360.62 A: is that your kids in the back 

365.30 366.13 A: yeah 

366.91 370.01 A: yeah i heard something outside the window 

369.18 372.42 B: that's um the tide just went out so 

372.62 380.50 B: it's getting a little the tide th- th- the tide's really low right now for some reason so we're on actually the marsh now instead of the water 

380.47 381.18 A: oh 

381.40 386.92 B: and so it's getting a little smelly and it's kind of riling everyone up i think to try and get over the fence and see what's going on 

387.65 390.83 A: oh so you're right on the water that's awful beautiful 

389.28 390.45 B: yeah uh-huh 

390.77 392.39 B: yeah my whole life i've 

392.83 394.51 B: kind of lived in the same area 

395.01 398.23 B: live about two doors from my parents we we've always been on the water here 

398.17 400.57 A: oh that is so nice 

400.11 405.37 B: yeah but recently but like in the past ten years they've changed like the tide patterns or they've 

405.48 410.97 B: the actually the way the island is shifting has changed so now i get i have land at low tide instead of water 

411.18 411.87 A: oh 

412.14 414.54 A: i don't know if that's good or bad 

412.55 413.20 B: what i'm hope- 

413.38 417.23 B: i wonder too i'm hoping they'll come through and dredge 

417.35 418.96 B: and give me back all water 

419.09 420.57 A: oh you like the water 

420.19 425.75 B: yeah that would w- used to be able to just dive off the dock that sort of thing to go swimming any time 

425.29 426.79 A: oh 

427.60 433.50 A: yeah it don't feel to good doesn't have the same effect 

434.60 440.29 B: um but that's uh i hate to keep taking your time but i mean i don't remember being told to press a button or 

439.69 441.30 A: yeah i have no idea 

441.44 442.15 B: it just said 

442.37 443.73 B: your recording partner 

443.30 444.43 A: yeah 

444.81 445.68 B: and it sounds like the 

445.80 447.76 B: i don't know on your end my line is getting bad 

447.43 450.92 A: mine line is all staticky and cracking 

449.48 449.97 B: that's 

450.07 452.17 B: yeah that's what mine's doing here
