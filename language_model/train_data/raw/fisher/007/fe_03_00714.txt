130.21 130.75 A: uh huh 

130.69 134.43 B: on a smaller scale because they take such precautions

216.04 217.82 A: the topic i don't know if it is or not 

217.01 220.80 B: no um i do agree i think we need to go over there and take care of it 

220.87 222.96 A: yeah before it gets here you know 

221.73 222.13 B: yeah i do 

223.24 223.68 B: um 

223.95 227.56 B: because we have to much of it here and 

229.17 234.14 B: i don't know if it's that pharmaceutical company but one of the pharmaceutical companies wer- 

234.36 235.88 B: was making the um 

236.96 237.40 B: smallpo- 

237.82 238.32 B: smallpo- 

238.47 238.96 B: vaccine 

239.16 239.70 A: uh huh 

240.26 241.39 B: um and that is 

241.48 245.02 B: the thing that were supposed to be looking for the first one 

245.34 249.79 A: oh really yeah i know they talked about that a lot i just didn't know why they talked about it 

246.00 246.51 B: yeah 

250.12 252.56 B: yeah they talked about that uh they have uh 

253.48 257.89 B: they're supposedly immunizing all military personnel and um 

258.78 260.15 B: government officials 

261.28 264.35 B: and then they're going to be offering it to the general public 

265.46 269.09 B: uh but they were trying to make it because they didn't have enough quantity 

269.97 271.69 B: do all of that at one time 

272.00 272.42 A: yeah 

272.88 274.56 B: so that's what they were doing 

274.72 275.02 B: so 

274.88 276.76 A: yeah i wonder 

277.05 277.91 A: how 

278.86 282.65 A: good since like i had one when i was real little they say it's no good anymore but 

283.57 285.54 A: you know would i have a reaction 

285.74 287.42 A: if i didn't have a reaction back then 

288.20 288.69 B: you know that's 

288.89 290.56 B: that's a good question 

290.98 297.06 B: they say it's not any good that uh that when they get enough that everyone should be vaccinated against it um 

298.24 299.96 B: i know i will be because i'm immune 

300.14 300.48 B: suppressed 

301.07 301.61 A: uh huh 

301.93 304.03 B: so um i i know that but um 

305.48 305.94 B: and 

306.07 310.98 B: people are saying they don't want to because it's like the anthrax vaccine it causes a lot of problems 

316.55 317.82 B: yeah 

320.70 321.22 B: yeah 

322.81 323.20 B: yeah 

324.46 325.81 A: um i'm wondering if they 

326.28 327.42 A: even if you were to get 

328.13 334.28 A: say smallpox now i'm sure that they could treat it better than they were able to way back when 

333.22 334.65 B: i'm sure they probably could 

335.94 336.33 A: but 

335.94 336.79 B: it's my survey 

338.43 338.81 B: yeah 

339.43 339.79 A: yeah 

339.58 341.26 B: a i'm sure they could um 

342.11 342.78 B: but um 

344.08 347.84 A: do you know anyways they would spread bio-terrorism i mean you know 

347.83 352.38 B: any ways that they would there the first source would be your water supply 

352.38 359.10 A: well yeah that's what you hear i mean would it be that ea- i mean i would think with all the chemicals they put in your water supply it would kill it 

354.89 355.29 B: yeah 

358.78 359.29 B: i know 

359.66 360.93 B: it would be easy 

361.10 361.38 B: no 

362.26 362.84 A: okay 

362.52 362.91 B: because 

363.13 365.21 B: they put chemicals in your water to kill 

366.32 367.48 B: um 

368.39 370.86 B: basically certain types of bacteria 

371.89 372.32 B: but 

372.92 374.42 B: so often now 

374.97 376.90 B: you see it doesn't get through 

377.43 380.05 B: things get in the water and don't don't get through we uh 

381.18 382.00 B: were in texas 

382.13 382.56 A: uh huh 

382.50 383.00 B: um 

383.19 384.64 B: quiet often we have 

384.84 385.55 B: that uh 

385.90 388.50 B: a lot of the water supply will be uh 

389.55 390.51 B: you can't consume it 

390.80 391.27 A: uh huh 

390.95 393.11 B: it's what do you call it now can't remember the name of it 

393.62 394.04 B: um 

394.47 395.55 B: things will get through the water 

395.83 396.32 A: oh 

396.48 396.99 A: okay 

396.88 397.86 B: um and it's like 

397.99 398.93 B: in waco 

399.23 403.56 B: k- right now their water there's a certain bacteria in there 

404.04 405.16 B: that they can't kill 

405.57 406.17 A: wow 

406.40 407.94 B: so you have to bottle water 

408.17 408.62 A: yeah 

409.10 409.66 A: wow 

409.65 410.12 B: yeah 

410.35 410.63 B: so 

411.32 412.48 A: wow okay 

412.01 412.34 B: so yeah 

412.54 412.95 B: so 

413.05 415.97 A: well i wonder if this is going to cause people to quit going out to eat 

416.94 417.42 B: no 

417.59 418.50 B: uh because 

418.66 419.17 B: um 

420.19 421.60 B: everything there comes 

422.49 423.68 B: that's washed 

424.95 426.24 B: as far as 

426.47 428.02 B: your gonna consume it washed 

428.19 428.94 B: like vegetables 

428.35 428.84 A: yeah 

429.29 430.59 B: come already 

430.73 432.70 B: prepackaged to the restaurants 

433.22 433.70 A: uh huh 

434.47 438.67 B: they already prepackaged all the vegetables and everything they come prewashed prepackaged 

439.40 439.85 A: yeah 

440.17 440.67 B: so 

441.59 444.38 B: it di- it did when they talked about it to begin with 

445.52 445.91 A: uh huh 

456.07 458.50 B: a problem with it with that um 

459.87 462.44 B: people will be more careful on what they consume 

462.65 463.18 A: yeah 

463.21 463.80 B: as far as 

463.91 464.54 B: street vendors 

464.95 466.38 A: well yes that's true 

466.36 467.51 B: you know those kind of things 

467.65 472.22 A: yeah i wonder w- and the other major scales i mean are we looking at 

473.03 477.04 A: like h- him gassing us like he gassed his own people 

476.69 477.28 B: yeah 

477.49 478.94 A: how would that u- u- 

479.19 481.74 A: you know i guess i'm not that educated as far as 

482.30 485.55 A: how would that be dispensed i mean is that by like the 

485.79 488.73 A: the planes they thought about you know whenever um 

488.92 489.99 A: after nine-eleven 

490.31 490.96 B: yeah 

490.53 492.91 A: you know they were all the dust-cropters you know 

492.64 493.38 B: right 

493.17 497.63 A: uh is that how did he release that gas on those people 

496.95 499.42 B: the gas there that's how he released it with planes 

499.69 500.74 A: oh okay 

500.49 500.85 B: yeah 

501.71 504.93 B: so on his own people but really you don't even have to have that it's 

505.16 505.63 B: you can use 

505.77 506.76 B: there's canisters 

507.12 507.59 A: uh huh 

507.31 509.06 B: as long as there's a air propellent in em 

509.44 509.85 A: uh huh 

510.52 512.24 B: so it can be released anywhere 

512.80 513.29 A: yeah 

513.79 514.35 B: like 

514.92 515.76 B: say you're 

516.48 519.25 B: at a ballgame lets say your in a an enclosed area 

519.44 519.80 A: yeah 

519.45 519.78 B: you know 

520.58 521.00 B: um 

521.24 523.57 B: it can be released into the air conditioning system 

523.65 524.12 A: yeah 

524.29 526.60 A: i know my sister had um 

526.86 532.53 A: oh pathology they cut up brains and when the- at the point this what 

532.65 538.12 A: twenty-five thirty years ago um that tells you how old i am um 

534.10 534.50 B: uh huh 

538.32 545.52 A: they when they would get bored at work they would cut up the brain of the legionnaires disease people you remember the legionnaires disease 

543.78 544.88 B: uh huh 

545.78 546.06 B: yeah 

546.17 555.00 A: um back them and you know to see if they could find any kind of clues i mean you know it was just this ongoing type thing 

551.47 551.97 B: right 

555.61 558.55 A: you know that was just something i guess everybody got 

559.06 559.41 B: yeah
