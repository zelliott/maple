9.22 11.51 A: uh bio-terrorism not really 

10.49 10.85 B: yeah 

25.03 25.53 B: about 

26.13 27.79 B: how (( do we )) um 

29.06 30.23 B: small pox for example 

34.64 41.03 B: a piece a piece of equipment commonly used like in a computer industry to like you know display fine droplets 

41.23 52.71 B: the only things you got to do is like you know have have a sample um and walk into an airport with this device and with it spray these little droplets about and a certain number of people will pick up the 

52.85 58.03 B: the disease and and carry it all over the country and presumably the world 

58.13 58.73 B: um 

59.74 66.93 B: so for that for that reason i i have i have my doubts about the ability of the united states to really 

67.04 67.50 B: do 

67.89 71.13 B: anything really powerful to to control it 

72.01 72.67 A: i agree 

73.90 74.53 A: and 

74.72 76.05 A: (( )) decided no 

76.46 76.91 A: that 

77.31 78.69 A: i i haven't seen that article 

79.49 85.16 A: but i i really think that if uh if somebody is going to do that then there is nothing really anything we can do to stop them 

79.52 80.05 B: yeah 

85.87 87.12 B: yeah it it 

86.38 88.20 A: if there is a will there is a way right 

88.05 96.57 B: yeah although yeah you would think that i mean it must not be so very i mean uh you know there's obviously an article like that you know they are trying to you know 

108.11 116.66 B: i understood that in government i mean they were really you know looking at this closely and and starting to take some action uh to try to you know build uh stockpiles of 

116.81 125.47 B: vaccine back up and and at the time they thought it was going to take quite some time to manage it but um it seems that they've been able to respond you know 

125.64 128.70 B: a lot more quickly than respond at the time 

128.80 129.28 B: um 

129.44 130.32 B: so 

130.45 131.14 B: but 

130.78 132.70 A: are you going are is uh 

133.06 136.15 A: vaccinations are offered to you for smallpox are you going to 

136.27 136.90 A: accept it 

145.56 148.28 B: so i have you know some remaining immunity 

149.44 151.68 B: i don't know i you know i have not looked into this it 

152.10 152.66 B: so that you know 

153.19 161.72 B: getting to to get enough information to decide you know whether it is a worthwhile thing to do or not you know considering the risks what what do you think 

161.53 163.38 A: i don't know i saw on um 

163.53 164.30 A: i guess it was 

164.42 164.90 A: the 

165.25 168.84 A: headline news or something where doctors in two different states have refused 

169.86 170.20 A: to 

170.40 171.67 A: become vaccinated and 

172.43 174.66 A: i guess for that reason i'm kind of 

174.95 175.68 A: unsure 

176.18 176.64 B: yeah 

176.19 180.83 A: because if the doctors don't want to do it then what is that supposed to be saying about it you know 

180.43 181.00 B: right 

181.15 184.46 B: yet there was an article in the paper the other day about the the 

193.05 195.39 B: what the results and uh and the ability of 

195.68 198.88 B: the risks of like actually transmitting it to to others 

199.50 202.75 B: but that you know i i didn't get quite get it 

203.88 205.60 A: well i think i kind of discussed it 

206.41 208.19 A: with a family member of mine and we 

207.92 208.29 B: yeah 

208.36 209.59 A: both kind of agreed that 

210.15 211.90 A: it doesn't seem really practical to 

212.22 213.08 A: become vaccinated 

213.83 214.55 A: against smallpox 

218.09 227.75 B: even though uh smallpox is really devastating in a place where there's not a lot of medical care available um in the united states 

228.05 228.54 B: it's 

228.75 230.27 B: it's reasonably 

230.39 236.61 B: treatable and uh and the and part of the good news is that because it is a disease that 

236.73 240.08 B: when when it becomes communicable to other people 

240.27 251.32 B: you have really obvious symptoms and signs so that people can you know be identified uh and treated and isolated but um i don't know (( )) 

251.59 254.17 B: i don't know how easy it is for example you know like with the 

254.49 257.29 B: the situation we have with anthrax where 

257.74 261.61 B: granted it it seemed kind of technically sophisticated to be able to 

261.76 264.42 B: to actually spread it about um 

264.58 266.94 B: once you are able to do that uh it seems that 

267.23 270.85 B: it's not it's a it's not a matter of communicating the disease but just you know 

271.26 277.85 B: being able to distribute it in big ways they were sort of fearing it might be done you know using crop dusters 

278.04 278.61 B: um 

278.93 286.26 B: and i suppose you know like that's that's i suppose that's an area where the government can actually you know do something um 

285.58 286.00 A: right 

286.93 291.46 B: that although i you know i don't know how you could control you know every crop duster in the united states 

292.01 294.04 B: there there must be thousands and thousands of them 

294.41 299.27 A: but they are um going to install sensors on some of the tall buildings in new york 

300.20 301.15 A: that um 

301.78 302.95 A: guess they have a filter 

303.17 303.88 A: and 

304.38 305.67 A: if someone were to release 

306.17 306.86 B: oh really 

306.18 308.20 A: anything chemical or or bio- 

308.37 308.85 A: chemical 

308.97 309.43 B: uh-huh 

309.58 312.02 A: then it would uh pick it up and it would 

312.38 313.33 A: you know report it 

313.93 314.38 B: right 

314.61 316.61 A: so they would know exactly when 

314.80 315.14 B: but what 

317.20 318.09 A: something like that 

318.30 318.95 A: had occurred 

320.07 321.60 B: yeah but isn't it like kind of like 

321.93 324.98 B: too late then 

322.94 324.51 A: well 

324.90 326.02 A: yeah 

326.04 333.36 B: i mean like what what are they going to do like you know sound sound an an alarm you know okay everybody quick run inside and panic 

334.94 335.50 B: i don't know 

335.90 337.10 B: hm that is kind of interesting 

339.35 344.73 B: well it seems like we must have more time to talk about this 

342.34 343.71 A: yeah 

343.94 344.58 A: uh-huh 

344.85 346.66 A: what more can you say 

346.58 347.67 B: um 

348.41 349.09 B: i don't know 

348.65 350.00 A: um i don't know i 

350.82 354.03 A: like i said i i don't think it is really a big spread um i'm 

354.47 355.81 A: very confidant in 

356.73 358.72 B: well why what makes you think it is not a 

356.97 357.71 A: what what they 

357.85 361.10 A: said just the government and the country is doing to protect us from 

361.83 362.73 A: for us like that 

362.88 364.84 B: well why do you think it is not a big threat 

366.01 366.69 A: um 

368.17 370.13 A: well because after nine eleven 

370.30 370.71 B: yeah 

370.79 373.33 A: we have all these new airport security 

373.52 375.04 A: measures and 

375.78 377.95 A: you know things are being done with the i._n._s. 

378.95 380.22 A: to insure that these 

380.70 381.83 A: illegal immigrants are 

382.41 383.83 A: being found and accounted for 

384.40 387.58 B: yeah but the thing is i mean something i mean (( )) 

387.75 390.29 B: and admittedly you know it takes some um 

390.73 402.41 B: technical sophistication in order to know how to you know work with the materials and sort of work to and then handle them appropriately but the thing is that the amount of materials required 

402.52 403.94 B: are really small 

404.74 411.03 B: they are not readily detectable by any means and i know and so for example you know if somebody you know 

419.62 421.30 B: tracking sometimes that sort of thing (( )) 

426.44 434.66 B: it's it's small you know it is compact easy and it doesn't take a lot of technical sophistication um once you've got the material 

434.82 437.95 B: to disperse it really you know to disperse it widely 

438.08 438.69 B: um 

439.22 440.62 B: and so for that reason 

441.77 448.75 B: i it it it's a (( )) and i don't think that you know that it is likely that you know what i mean that any individual could like you know 

449.15 451.90 B: cook this up in a basement so 

452.13 455.85 B: but um as long as they are continued to be 

456.24 465.90 B: uh states who are you know working with and the united states more than anybody else you know has developed a lot of these kinds of agents um but you know 

475.26 477.12 B: where they you know the programs are sort of like 

477.39 479.35 B: you know stopped um 

479.99 490.46 B: but there are these you know there are scientists who have worked on the programs don't have jobs now uh the materials are maintained with like really low security um 

489.93 490.26 A: yes 

490.61 495.84 B: and with see with to begin with a sufficient incentive and money um 

496.52 500.39 B: you could get a hold of the materials and uh do a lot of damage 

500.68 507.60 B: and it would you know and kind of just like with the you know the nine eleven with the nine eleven events um it would take just a small number of 

507.90 509.46 B: of committed people 

510.17 511.03 B: to produce 

511.30 512.78 B: pretty ghastly results 

514.23 516.94 B: not that i'm hear to scare to scare the pants off you 

514.74 517.23 A: right especially if there is a bunch of scientists
