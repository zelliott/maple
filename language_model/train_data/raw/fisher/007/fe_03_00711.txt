42.62 43.04 B: right 

43.13 45.87 A: they have you know bioterrorism 

46.14 46.53 A: um 

47.94 50.48 A: chemical weapons as well as biological 

51.71 52.08 A: because 

52.44 52.71 A: that's 

52.93 57.01 A: what's (( gonna )) unite the other countries behind us to do something about this 

57.45 61.29 B: and i think i think it's been a problem for a really long time and 

61.44 62.15 B: we have not 

62.61 63.18 B: realized 

62.81 63.72 A: addressed it 

63.86 64.31 A: yeah 

64.05 67.99 B: y- we have not yet we have not addressed it we have not realized how big of a problem 

68.60 70.37 B: i don't think we've been aware of 

70.67 70.98 B: of 

71.59 73.53 B: all the vast amounts of 

74.24 77.73 B: terrorists out there that are capable and have this stuff in their hands 

78.44 80.28 B: um and now i think there's so many 

81.30 82.26 B: that have access 

83.05 83.50 A: mhm 

83.60 84.18 B: to different 

84.37 84.89 B: sources 

85.31 88.92 B: you know where they can unleash these things against us and other countries 

89.17 90.07 A: exactly 

89.76 90.61 B: um it 

90.46 99.73 A: and i'd i wonder if we would have even ever known had it not been for the nine eleven attack and everything that's followed up it's brought it all more out in the open 

99.52 100.00 B: right 

100.07 101.60 A: before it was just like 

102.17 105.43 A: you know when when when you heard of the middle east having 

105.61 107.84 A: biological weapons you kind of just 

107.38 108.75 B: it was just something you heard 

108.66 110.17 A: yeah you never really 

110.29 112.90 A: realized it or believed it you know so 

112.51 114.43 B: right but now you're hearing of things 

114.62 116.04 B: that are happening here 

116.68 120.13 B: and you hear more things everyday and i don't know 

120.62 121.03 B: um 

121.17 121.97 B: i support 

122.08 123.85 B: president bush in what he's doing 

124.49 126.26 B: however i think the problem is 

126.40 126.96 B: so 

127.52 128.39 B: large 

129.04 129.79 B: right now 

130.01 130.46 A: mhm 

130.61 131.27 B: um 

131.39 131.95 B: you know 

132.09 132.45 B: they 

133.59 137.43 B: i don't know if there's any one solution but they definitely have to 

138.12 139.42 B: become stricter 

139.81 141.00 B: in every area 

141.82 144.09 B: you know not just like what they did with the airlines 

144.45 145.06 B: labs 

144.55 145.05 A: right 

145.49 146.88 B: you know scientific labs 

145.51 145.89 A: right 

147.53 148.85 B: um research labs 

149.52 150.56 B: an- you know i mean 

150.77 153.38 B: everything has to be looked over now 

153.93 156.53 B: like you said there're so many ports of entry 

154.03 154.41 A: yes 

156.83 157.23 A: right 

157.35 157.71 A: well 

161.94 162.43 B: right 

163.32 163.91 B: mhm 

163.83 169.13 A: and they are they are stricter from what you hear and see on the news than they used to be but 

169.28 178.02 A: do you have any idea how many millions of tons of cargo come in in sealed containers how can they possibly there's no way you know 

176.07 176.54 B: right 

177.76 181.54 B: and i think before nine eleven everything was too lax 

181.68 182.60 A: oh yeah 

182.44 183.47 B: and now 

182.71 183.54 A: by far 

184.07 186.60 B: everything's on hyper alert but you can't just 

186.88 188.31 B: change this problem 

188.55 191.52 B: in a matter of a month or months or a year 

192.22 194.56 B: um i think it's something they have to constantly 

195.41 197.38 A: yeah it takes constant vigilance 

196.80 200.96 B: i live in a in a little town in rural virginia i'm originally from new jersey 

201.10 201.50 A: uh-huh 

201.60 202.17 B: um 

202.43 204.40 B: and so a lot of times 

204.64 206.94 B: i tend to feel isolated as far as 

207.68 209.78 B: you know -cause i don't live near any big cities 

210.42 211.94 B: um but i do get 

212.10 213.85 B: online reports from 

214.03 216.63 B: uh organizations that report more than the news 

216.83 217.24 A: right 

217.60 219.28 B: and so i do keep up 

219.68 221.19 B: and there's a lot more 

221.67 224.62 B: that's going on than i'm finding out from the regular news 

225.06 225.47 A: right 

225.77 227.48 B: um so it does scare me 

228.03 228.90 B: because it is a 

229.66 231.81 B: you know even though i live in rural virginia 

232.50 241.59 A: yeah it doesn't matter where you live anymore the world is too small to think like i'm ou- out of harm's way it just isn't true anymore you know 

232.55 233.04 B: i mean 

233.53 234.58 B: it doesn't matter 

241.80 244.60 A: terrorism can strike anywhere 

244.74 247.67 A: you know in any number of ways that i 

247.26 249.52 B: and i i don't you think that um 

250.61 253.01 B: a lot of times politics gets in the way 

253.46 256.58 A: oh that that's a major part of the problem i 

256.21 258.06 B: because i mean even though 

258.82 260.02 B: i happen to support 

260.21 261.35 B: president bush 

261.92 264.70 B: i wouldn't consider myself a strong republican 

264.84 265.68 B: and i really 

267.19 272.13 B: i would rather not have it be a party issue i just it it's something 

272.64 273.60 B: that the politics 

272.80 281.88 A: it should be an issue that's for the good of the country but it never works that way because of politics yeah you share the same views that i do i can see 

278.00 278.48 B: no 

278.83 279.54 B: that's right 

280.52 280.91 B: yeah 

281.02 282.31 B: i totally agree 

282.02 285.44 A: yeah yeah it it it really 

286.63 288.91 A: ah in the past say 

289.02 291.65 A: ten years i've become so 

292.17 294.26 A: bitter about politicians 

293.70 294.49 B: me too 

294.66 295.43 B: me too 

294.88 296.05 A: because i just 

296.19 306.08 A: they're not helping the country they're they're so vote minded and party minded that nothing important that should be done ever gets done 

300.99 301.47 B: right 

305.50 307.63 B: right and all the money i see 

307.91 309.68 B: you know to me you know i 

309.89 310.36 B: i was 

310.49 313.79 B: brought up and i was brought up very patriotically and i love my country 

313.94 314.42 A: yes 

314.26 315.54 B: um but you know i see these 

316.14 321.35 B: political ads and you know all that money that is getting poured into the political ads could be used 

321.86 323.65 A: for a lot better purposes 

322.49 326.34 B: for a lot of other things that would benefit al- the people of this country 

323.97 324.48 A: mhm 

326.98 328.39 B: um but i mean there's just 

328.56 329.88 B: so many ways 

330.00 330.27 B: that 

331.62 337.90 B: that bioterrorism can be unleashed i just read online about um i don't know if you read about this 

338.58 340.26 B: the national zoo just lost 

340.47 341.75 B: another rare animal 

341.86 342.88 A: oh no i didn't 

342.89 345.69 B: um in washington which is three hours from me 

345.81 346.23 A: uh-huh 

346.42 346.97 B: um 

347.25 348.96 B: and the first two deaths 

349.51 352.49 B: was not a big deal because animals die in the zoo all the time 

352.42 352.88 A: mhm 

352.97 355.00 B: but now this is like the eighth or ninth 

355.13 356.81 B: death in a matter of six months 

357.22 359.04 A: so they wonder what's going on 

357.76 358.77 B: um and 

359.02 360.65 B: poison was one of the 

361.08 361.70 B: methods 

362.35 366.44 B: um but now it's like okay these are rare animals that are (( gonna )) be extinct 

366.94 370.37 B: so is there something else going on so there's something else that we didn't even think of 

372.08 372.46 A: yeah 

372.12 373.85 B: you know there's so many avenues 

374.12 374.94 A: oh i know 

374.89 377.49 B: i mean and and if wh- depending on where you live i mean you know 

377.66 380.74 B: think of where all the food gets shipped from all over the united states 

380.92 381.34 A: mhm 

381.85 382.49 B: i mean 

382.09 391.95 A: well i i look what happened with with the uh the bioterrorism in the the mail i mean look at the huge amounts of money it took to 

388.17 388.79 B: i know 

392.72 395.87 A: to counteract that and it's still not a hundred percent 

395.99 398.13 A: safe you know the small pox 

396.75 397.28 B: sure 

398.68 399.35 A: thing and 

402.63 403.75 B: i'm a person 

404.03 404.51 B: that 

405.14 405.69 B: um 

406.60 409.81 B: is very tolerant of other people that are different than me 

409.81 410.25 A: mhm 

410.64 414.45 B: but there are so many and i said this even before nine eleven 

415.19 419.46 B: you know i hear all the people complaining about living in this country a lot of the celebrities 

420.00 420.85 B: a lot of the 

421.08 421.51 B: you know 

422.48 423.43 B: famous people 

424.09 424.81 B: uh and 

425.47 428.04 B: we have let so many people into this country 

428.51 429.25 B: and even our 

429.35 432.21 B: our immigration system i believe has been too lax 

432.91 438.10 A: well it's fallen through the cracks that's how all the terrorists got into the country 

433.00 433.36 B: an i'm 

434.83 436.05 B: yeah i'm not saying 

437.12 437.43 B: that 

437.62 438.50 B: that's right 

438.26 439.00 A: heh 

438.74 442.63 B: and there are still i mean i'm reading everyday online all the 

442.82 443.09 B: the 

443.58 445.89 B: immigrants they're arresting who have ties 

446.57 447.02 A: mhm 

446.91 447.59 B: to terrorists 

447.77 448.24 B: and 

447.87 448.33 A: yes 

448.73 450.65 B: so by no means i mean 

450.77 454.75 B: there are still a lot of people hiding out in -is in this country alone 

454.60 456.28 A: oh yes i agree 

455.33 458.37 B: that have the money and the opportunity to basically 

459.45 460.70 B: do anything they want 

460.83 461.12 B: huh 

463.38 464.45 A: that if we 

464.58 467.89 A: attack his country our country will be attacked 

468.06 472.81 A: he may in fact know that's the case because i'm sure there's a lot of terrorist cells 

473.05 477.47 A: still here in secret that would try to unleash something if war broke out 

477.30 479.46 B: right and you know these people 

479.78 481.17 B: don't think like we do 

481.40 484.76 A: of that's right and they have no respect for human life 

484.10 487.25 B: no they think they're heroes by what they're doing 

486.14 486.85 A: yes 

487.06 487.85 A: yes 

487.58 488.67 B: and you know 

488.99 490.73 B: they think we're the evil ones 

490.85 491.72 B: and so 

492.07 493.65 B: anything western to them 

494.67 495.49 A: is evil 

494.71 495.06 B: is 

495.17 495.96 B: is evil 

495.79 496.46 A: mhm
