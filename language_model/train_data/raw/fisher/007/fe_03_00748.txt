14.80 16.08 A: [laughter] 

15.40 20.57 B: i i think the worst thing about comedy these days is bad language that they use 

20.28 30.08 A: yeah there's too much of the f. word in it it seems like they can't even make a a a t._v. show any more without that word 

22.61 25.07 B: yeah that's that's not

32.00 33.08 B: (( the um )) 

33.78 37.54 B: i i think that's probably the worst thing there is about comedy today 

37.43 41.50 A: and i've got teenagers now and they can't see any thing wrong with it 

41.87 44.98 B: that's the problem with teenagers these days 

44.63 53.53 A: i also teach in the church so i really have a a um hard time trying to tell them that some of these shows that they watch that they think are so good are not 

53.15 54.42 B: yeah 

54.65 57.73 B: i th- think th- they grow up with a different standard

63.93 76.38 A: yeah i've got a i've got a twenty two year old now and when she was a teenager she thought friends was the greatest and there is a lot of comedy in it but i never realized how much drinking was in it

123.48 137.47 A: i mean the woman had a baby out of wedlock but it's excellent how she carries on and and how the teenager survives now and of course she takes care of everyone she's got a job and how she succeeds but it's got a good moral thing underneath it there's no cussing

189.87 191.09 A: (( oh )) 

191.73 205.63 A: well one thing i like about seven seven now they've got that one in this area which i was so glad to see cause i didn't know what it was till my daughter was telling me about it [sigh] and i finally sat down and was looking at it with her and it's about a minister and his wife and their family but he doesn't 

198.92 200.13 B: yeah 

204.33 206.75 B: yeah i've watched since it started 

206.22 214.53 A: yeah but it doesn't make it like they don't have any problems and that's what i like about it they find out that the world does have problems no matter what 

209.33 210.29 B: yeah 

213.89 215.22 B: yeah 

214.73 216.58 A: and they learn how to deal with them 

217.71 218.69 A: so 

218.89 221.47 B: th- they've dealt with some pretty rough stuff on that show 

221.63 227.95 A: yeah they don't have those good old comedies on i don't know how old you are but i know i like the the used to like the cosby's an- 

227.65 228.92 B: yeah

251.93 254.14 B: that is classic comedy 

253.26 255.85 A: i don't think that show loses its 

256.03 257.09 A: value 

257.21 261.93 B: no and it it they never re- at the time they were doing with things that were 

262.27 266.48 B: you know borderline bad taste but today it's just funny 

266.08 267.03 A: yeah 

267.04 277.51 B: and it's it's so it's comical to to watch it plus you can my mother in law and i she don't watch much t._v. but she and i can sit down together and watch that show 

277.80 281.62 B: because we both love it and it just never ever gets old 

282.45 294.29 A: yeah it don't get old because i mean ev- my daughter'll stay up late i don't know which night it's on saturday or sunday i think it's sunday night after church and she won't go to bed early cause she'll want to see those old old i love lucy shows 

294.40 298.34 A: and she says if you don't have good laugh in today's world it's not even worth living

333.98 335.27 B: oh my goodness 

334.75 338.55 A: so we've been growing now it wasn't that big when we first moved here 

338.16 341.96 B: um there's a there's a couple of hard types that i like a library 

342.21 343.80 B: her comedy video 

343.79 346.29 A: hm well currently i haven't seen her 

346.07 349.29 B: she's funny and she's i mean she 

349.52 351.97 B: she's real bizarre in her religion 

352.07 354.42 B: and so she brings that into her comedy show 

354.75 358.26 B: and there's a guy who travels with the gaythers who does 

358.08 363.82 A: now i love the gaythers so you're getting at my age i l- i've got a whole bunch of their tapes

388.22 389.29 A: yeah 

391.34 392.55 A: oh 

392.87 396.79 B: i think if more people could clean up their act they'd be a lot funnier 

397.14 403.27 A: well that's just like okay america's funniest videos that's one of my sixteen year old's favorite shows 

402.63 404.01 B: yeah

407.24 408.60 B: yeah 

407.92 410.47 A: so if they've got animals in it that's what she likes 

411.19 414.94 A: but she'll just sit by the hours and watch it 

414.03 421.33 B: i used to watch it but it's gotten to where they show a lot of you know people getting men getting hit in the groin and that's just not funny to me 

419.75 431.27 A: they need to back away from that now it seemed like there for a while they went into a lot of that and i didn't find it that funny either so i said something to her and then she had it on here day before yesterday i think it was 

422.19 423.21 B: (( i like )) 

430.82 431.94 B: mhm 

431.33 441.78 A: and it was basically all good clean stuff there wasn't anything on it it was all animals and kids and so it was more back where where i didn't mind her watching it 

440.39 442.16 B: yeah 

443.20 444.45 B: (( but ah ))

473.43 474.64 A: yeah 

473.98 481.42 B: it's just it's wrong and they i mean they- there's some really unfunny stuff on that show but people keep watching it 

481.56 488.49 A: well that's kind of like will and grace it it's a comedy but i kept telling my daughter she couldn't watch it cause it had a gay on it 

487.81 488.96 B: yeah 

488.44 498.33 A: and if you watch it it is funny but now she was sitting here yesterday and had it on and i said no that one you got to turn off because they were like they were promoting everything about the gays

502.05 503.28 B: oh my goodness 

502.88 515.18 A: i mean the show itself can be funny with him living with a girl but a- a- and the comedy things but it an of course one girl pretending but then when they got into everything was about teaching this guy how to be gay who didn't even want to be gay 

514.93 516.33 B: and that's just wrong 

515.61 519.98 A: i said now i draw the line there that show has had it you can't watch it no more 

517.17 518.14 B: yeah 

520.83 523.93 A: because i knew exactly what it would get to be

527.89 529.88 A: he's married and got kids 

529.49 531.83 B: i don't see why he would want to act like he is
