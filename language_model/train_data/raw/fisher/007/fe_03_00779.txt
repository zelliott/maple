6.46 9.73 A: we are supposed to be talking about opening our own business 

9.60 10.44 B: well yeah 

10.82 12.49 A: but i already have my own business 

12.28 12.89 B: oh really 

12.88 14.82 A: -cause i guess they didn't know that 

16.30 18.26 A: yes i have an insurance business 

18.14 18.56 B: oh 

19.87 21.13 A: and what would you do 

21.86 23.97 B: actually i would like to open a small bookstore 

24.22 25.28 B: something a little uh 

26.31 26.63 B: (( )) 

26.75 27.19 B: a little book- 

27.31 27.89 B: -store actually 

29.45 33.66 A: nice well uh i have a suggestion for you if you open a bookstore 

33.90 34.28 B: uh-huh 

34.89 38.37 A: because i'm buying a lot of sherlock holmes related books 

39.17 40.19 A: but um 

40.57 42.03 A: they only file by 

42.26 43.54 A: the author's name 

44.08 46.53 A: the people who are looking for sherlock holmes books 

47.03 52.12 A: want to look in the section that has all the sherlock holmes books by all the authors in the same place 

50.97 51.44 B: yeah 

52.71 56.32 A: because they never know the authors of the other ones other then the original stories 

56.37 56.93 B: that's like with 

57.12 58.74 B: star wars and those types of things 

58.81 61.56 A: right but additional stuff always keeps coming out 

62.05 65.39 A: of course none of it by arthur conan doyle since he's dead 

66.20 66.88 A: um 

67.66 72.43 A: you never know i think that i've only i've probably run into one bookstore no two bookstores 

73.06 76.98 A: that have a section like that every place else you have to go looking everywhere for it 

78.42 79.74 A: but um 

79.93 80.83 A: what do you do now 

81.92 84.20 B: well i was an assistant manager of uh 

84.75 85.64 B: store um 

88.80 89.27 A: oh 

91.37 94.39 A: well i guess if i had to open a business other then the 

107.27 108.28 A: great time to be opening 

110.02 110.57 B: yeah 

111.99 119.80 A: but i suppose if i had to open a new business i would probably open some other insurance related business since that's pretty much what i know 

120.50 120.86 B: that work 

120.96 122.02 B: pretty good for you 

121.92 126.05 A: yeah well our family has been doing it for uh eighty some years 

125.63 126.26 B: oh wow 

127.24 129.97 A: business was originally founded by my grandfather 

130.04 130.30 B: huh 

130.57 131.04 B: that's intere- 

131.71 132.62 A: but um 

133.13 135.24 A: had never thought about what else i would do 

136.14 136.56 A: um 

138.44 139.59 A: maybe a consulting bus- 

147.99 148.89 B: yeah 

149.60 151.01 A: sounds like what i'd be interested 

153.26 154.23 A: so have you um 

157.00 158.97 A: -store for a while or did you just come up with it 

158.43 159.61 B: not really it's been 

159.74 162.11 B: it's been pretty recent that i've been thinking about it 

165.06 165.45 B: yeah 

169.28 170.90 A: so keep that in mind 

171.66 172.58 A: but um 

174.10 176.33 A: i mean unless you uh are a big 

177.76 181.73 A: business like barnes and noble or somebody like that probably though 

180.46 180.88 B: yeah 

182.12 184.45 A: the only way that smaller bookstores 

185.43 189.12 A: prosper is if they specialize in a particular area i think 

187.63 188.47 B: oh yeah 

189.41 192.87 A: like a mystery bookstore or a science fiction bookstore 

193.78 195.80 A: or something like that that carries stuff that 

196.21 198.39 A: is hard for people to find otherwise 

199.91 202.62 A: i know i always go to the little mystery bookstore and 

203.53 208.18 A: and when i'm in new york and there's another little mystery bookstore i go to it and arizona that 

209.72 213.41 A: has special sherlock holmes sec- sections and they carry stuff 

214.85 216.90 A: can't get through normal channels usually 

217.01 217.49 B: yeah 

218.84 219.54 A: but 

219.92 220.48 A: whatever 

222.91 223.47 A: um 

224.23 225.54 A: i don't know actually what they want 

226.29 229.39 B: yeah this was the first survey i've taken so i don't know 

229.28 231.81 A: yeah it's the first time i've been called also 

232.98 237.91 A: and uh the problem is that they're calling my office so by the time that phone call gets to me i don't 

238.15 239.87 A: haven't heard the recording anymore 

239.60 240.14 B: oh 

241.23 244.17 A: and i just press buttons until it repeated itself 

246.64 247.19 A: um 

249.40 255.97 A: just in concept hook up two people who have never met and ask them to talk about a subject they have (( )) they have no preparation for 

255.57 256.86 B: yeah 

256.93 260.49 A: then you've got to think of something to keep talking about for ten minutes 

263.16 265.36 A: where they what area of the country are you in 

265.33 266.97 B: i'm in uh northeast ohio 

267.30 267.94 A: uh-huh in a 

268.21 269.81 A: big city or in uh 

269.66 270.24 B: um 

270.38 271.29 A: rural area 

270.79 271.85 B: in about canton 

272.02 272.77 B: around canton 

272.49 273.56 A: oh okay 

275.00 275.71 B: but uh 

275.88 278.21 B: too many neat little bookstores around here 

277.97 278.74 A: yeah well 

279.05 280.32 A: if you can find something that 

281.27 284.58 A: that people are interested in that doesn't have a lot of competition that's 

285.17 286.69 A: probably the way to go 

288.22 291.65 A: uh there's plenty of consulting businesses around that's for sure 

294.18 294.66 A: um 

295.30 295.55 A: what 

296.72 298.61 A: call him back in a couple minutes 

299.36 300.26 A: um 

305.67 306.53 A: uh well 

307.21 307.78 A: um 

309.56 314.44 A: sure you uh if you've thought about it at all you know places you got to start is 

314.82 316.29 A: finding a location and 

316.55 317.02 B: yeah 

318.63 321.74 A: and that sort of thing and getting financing and 

323.01 325.36 A: lot of research you can do online these days 

326.20 327.64 B: i do that 

329.67 330.40 A: but um 

331.14 334.50 A: i can't imagine starting something new at this point in time i'm getting 

335.15 336.44 A: i'm thinking about uh 

336.79 338.19 A: starting to wind down 

339.83 341.18 A: and do less 

342.13 343.36 B: bad economy right now 

343.35 344.69 A: travel some more 

345.62 347.58 A: well i hope you find something soon 

348.15 349.05 B: me too 

358.09 358.65 A: um 

362.04 363.39 A: i don't know what else to talk about 

365.06 365.90 A: tell you the truth 

369.45 371.25 A: have you given thought to any other um 

372.43 374.20 A: businesses besides bookstores 

374.20 374.69 B: um 

375.05 375.60 B: well not 

375.72 376.49 B: by myself 

376.73 377.31 B: but with 

377.41 377.81 B: um 

385.91 388.54 B: it would be kind of hard in this area because there's 

389.54 391.07 B: be a need for that sort of thing 

392.16 393.56 A: like a night club type thing 

393.24 393.68 B: yeah 

393.82 394.24 B: yeah 

395.99 396.52 A: yeah 

396.75 397.23 A: got to have 

397.90 399.70 A: you got to have the right market again 

399.35 399.80 B: yeah 

399.88 401.22 A: depends on what kind of 

401.72 403.90 A: whether there's going to be entertainment and 

408.04 409.38 A: and it all starts with having a 

410.29 414.65 A: if you're going to serve food with having a good chef and a good menu 

413.32 414.33 B: yeah 

416.84 418.53 A: once the word spreads 

422.69 424.13 A: failure rate's pretty high 

425.08 426.10 B: yeah exactly 

428.61 431.44 B: i have a really good location and a lot of good 

431.54 432.40 B: advertisement on that 

432.56 432.99 A: right 

434.05 436.22 A: as far as restaurant type businesses go 

439.62 440.65 A: but i guess 

441.12 443.79 A: if you do not do anything else right now then 

444.40 447.18 A: you got to be thinking about starting something on your own 

447.13 447.72 B: mhm 

448.09 452.54 A: it's always better off working for yourself i think then working for someone else 

453.72 453.98 A: but 

454.14 454.74 A: uh 

461.14 469.27 A: well i guess we'll probably be hearing a warning pretty soon that our time is up but uh i wish you lots of luck if you get started in something 

469.23 470.02 B: so well thank you 

470.67 471.85 A: and um 

473.59 475.37 A: hopefully things will turn around for you 

479.47 480.60 B: only about two weeks 

483.96 485.57 B: it was by choice 

487.27 488.21 A: that's important 

489.25 491.60 A: well now you have time take it easy for a while and then 

491.46 494.68 B: yeah that's what i thought maybe take a vacation 

492.60 493.93 A: when it warms up a little 

495.01 496.67 A: after it warms up then you can go out 

496.77 497.90 A: start looking around 

498.83 500.96 A: check out the bookstores in the area 

503.03 505.15 A: and see what you can come up with 

506.74 507.35 A: good to the like 

508.47 512.02 A: go to work for somebody else's bookstore to see how things work for a while 

511.37 512.35 B: yeah exactly 

514.62 515.93 B: so i'll be inside 

519.08 522.13 A: might be doing right or might be doing wrong that you can uh 

530.54 530.85 A: be 

547.30 549.83 A: how long ago did you sign up for this thing 

549.62 550.47 B: uh about
