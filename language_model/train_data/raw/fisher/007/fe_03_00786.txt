94.56 96.80 A: i was thinking more like a bar or night club 

96.80 97.35 B: oh 

97.36 102.30 A: yeah that's the thing to do in new york city if you want to make money and have fun

103.12 103.60 A: yeah 

106.88 108.10 A: oh you're i'm a smoker

111.61 112.54 B: i guess 

111.86 123.14 A: well i'm going to be i go down actually go down to manhattan a lot and i go out and i don't know what's going to happen now with the smoking ban with especially the the places i go to what it's going to be like 

115.65 116.28 B: uh-huh 

122.89 124.51 B: yeah yeah i don't know i think 

124.93 128.80 B: i think there's some exceptions like either very small shops or 

128.85 131.23 A: yeah i heard if they're owner operated in other words if 

130.63 131.74 B: owner operated 

131.58 142.13 A: if they're operated by the owner of the bar and they're of the bar then they they can allow smoking so what i read i read in i think new york magazine that 

138.31 138.84 B: (( )) 

141.51 142.31 B: i think you're right 

142.61 143.61 A: that um 

143.71 149.42 A: what some of the owners are doing are giving their employees like you know like half a percent ownership of the bar 

149.26 149.71 B: uh-huh 

149.66 150.59 A: to get around the law 

150.78 151.69 B: oh
