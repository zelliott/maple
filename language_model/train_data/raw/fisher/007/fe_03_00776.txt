131.22 133.21 A: ah just the accessibility of things and

170.93 172.45 B: variety of people 

172.87 173.33 A: okay 

172.96 175.38 B: because it's very hard to see so many 

175.89 181.39 B: different people you know with different colors and different backgrounds and different ethnicity 

180.17 180.68 A: right 

182.16 183.65 B: um i lived in europe

187.73 187.99 A: right 

188.33 188.79 B: so 

189.31 190.83 B: i think that part

222.49 222.85 A: okay 

223.39 224.06 B: so

231.92 232.28 B: well 

232.98 233.26 B: (( )) 

233.40 234.49 B: what did you say you 

234.83 235.37 B: would miss 

235.49 238.12 B: the food i don't understand that part because you know you 

238.71 239.46 B: kind of get 

239.69 241.32 B: american food everywhere 

241.71 242.10 A: well it's 

242.76 243.51 A: i don't know 

243.76 245.08 A: there's it's different 

245.22 246.06 A: i think it's different 

246.66 249.34 A: i mean y- there's mcdonald's everywhere but it's not the same 

249.80 250.16 B: oh th- 

250.10 255.75 A: there's there's fried chicken everywhere but it's not the same i don't know 

250.32 250.71 B: true 

253.13 253.73 B: okay 

255.88 256.98 A: maybe it's the way they make it 

257.33 258.78 A: maybe it's in the water or something 

259.40 260.15 B: oh yeah 

264.49 266.13 A: but you definitely wouldn't miss the food 

266.95 269.53 B: no guess i guess not maybe um 

269.74 272.31 B: you know not the american food maybe like 

272.45 273.64 B: indian food and 

273.63 274.08 A: i see 

274.22 277.62 B: all different kinds of food which you can get really easily 

277.93 278.30 A: i see 

278.56 278.92 B: you know 

279.06 282.07 B: if you go to go out just to any street and 

282.38 284.41 B: you pretty much find anything here 

284.91 286.97 B: and it's very hard like in europe 

287.26 287.96 B: to find 

288.24 288.50 B: just 

288.73 293.31 B: japanese food indian food and thai food in one place it's really really hard 

290.03 290.45 A: right 

293.57 294.56 B: and even in korea 

295.10 295.62 B: so 

296.75 297.18 B: i guess 

298.10 299.83 B: oh in terms of food i i'll miss 

299.95 301.18 B: that variety 

301.56 301.90 A: uh huh 

301.77 303.07 B: but not like you know 

303.51 307.82 B: american food because if i think american food then i think of like hamburgers 

308.38 310.42 B: and mcdonald's and things like that 

311.19 311.55 A: i see 

311.91 312.31 B: so 

312.01 313.12 A: (( )) um 

313.22 314.51 A: other things like what else 

315.05 317.59 A: um what else would be something that you would not miss 

318.35 318.81 B: um 

318.45 321.22 A: like in terms of like culture in terms of uh 

321.33 322.15 A: the way people act 

322.93 323.71 A: what what like 

324.06 326.72 A: you coming from korea what what have you found surprising 

327.30 328.40 A: over here in the states 

329.15 330.16 A: that you wouldn't have expected 

329.17 329.85 B: um 

332.01 332.60 B: um 

333.49 334.02 B: wow 

335.27 335.74 B: (( i'm )) 

336.12 337.45 B: i don't know actually korea is 

337.71 339.05 B: pretty much americanized 

339.45 339.98 A: oh okay 

339.51 341.08 B: so i was not very surprised 

341.27 343.67 B: so i didn't experience any culture shock 

344.16 347.33 B: and i lived in europe for four years before coming here 

346.54 347.08 A: oh okay 

347.62 351.89 B: here is not very different well it's it's very different from europe definitely 

352.21 353.03 B: but still i was 

353.24 355.83 B: kind of open to any kind of shock you know 

356.11 356.50 A: i see 

356.66 357.19 B: i think 

358.20 358.60 B: uh 

358.80 360.79 B: i would miss the the (( occur- )) 

360.90 361.98 B: academy park 

362.38 362.81 B: because 

363.18 363.60 B: i like 

363.71 366.98 B: the education system here i i like the grad school 

367.17 368.54 B: and that's why i came here 

367.49 367.98 A: okay 

369.25 369.65 B: and 

369.79 371.21 B: the interaction with the 

371.31 372.88 B: professors it's kind of 

373.53 375.05 B: it's it's very different it's not 

375.56 376.94 B: um it's very casual 

377.36 378.23 B: it's not very 

378.99 380.06 B: conservative 

380.37 380.86 A: oh okay 

381.18 383.47 B: i think i will miss that part definitely 

381.77 382.05 A: right 

385.43 385.69 B: (( but )) 

386.03 386.47 B: very 

386.72 387.86 B: friendly i think 

388.39 389.12 B: they are much 

390.51 391.75 B: more open to 

392.12 392.78 B: foreigners 

393.33 395.59 B: since they kind of grow up with foreigners 

395.79 396.17 B: you know 

395.95 396.23 A: right 

397.15 397.88 B: so i think 

398.00 401.74 B: i'll miss that part so it's kind of hard also for me to say that i'm 

402.07 403.13 B: i'll accept that 

403.87 404.24 B: you know 

404.44 405.92 B: hundred million dollars 

406.48 406.83 A: yeah 

406.50 408.50 B: and not coming back again 

408.72 410.27 A: yeah that's that's definitely something 

410.89 411.39 A: i don't know 

412.98 414.90 A: it's definitely a lifestyle change that definitely is 

415.33 416.31 A: a hard decision to make 

416.45 417.18 B: right right 

417.41 419.20 B: and i think i'll miss the landscape 

419.32 419.65 B: too 

420.24 420.93 A: the what i'm sorry 

421.21 423.55 B: the landscape you know a lot of different 

423.00 423.60 A: oh right 

424.55 429.76 B: (( phase )) a lot of different countries and eh the oceans and things like that 

427.09 427.41 A: right 

434.91 436.57 B: and what do you think you're not going to miss 

437.64 439.42 A: uh the one thing that i'm not going to miss 

440.14 440.88 A: is uh 

441.70 442.58 A: i guess uh 

443.05 443.79 A: just the amount of 

445.08 446.83 A: like in dealing with people and uh 

447.47 448.67 A: just like realizing how 

448.79 450.40 A: how people react there's a lot of 

450.98 455.11 A: of fear i realize that people have a lot of fear and a lot of racism against towards each other 

455.83 456.39 A: and i uh 

457.55 458.05 A: and uh 

458.60 461.08 A: i don't know just other other places that i've encountered you know 

461.86 462.44 A: uh 

462.68 464.57 A: i've just realized that that's something that 

464.72 466.52 A: that is not really 

467.08 467.51 A: you know 

467.69 468.54 A: it's not as 

469.24 471.48 A: bad as as it is in the states 

472.32 472.78 A: i don't know 

473.99 474.89 A: i don't know if you 

475.09 475.77 A: if you know what i'm 

476.15 478.71 A: if you understand what i'm talking about but if 

479.94 480.40 A: uh 

481.70 485.70 A: but like for instance did you know that uh that america has a 

485.89 487.27 A: high one of the most uh 

488.02 489.00 A: ah highest rate of uh 

489.40 490.48 A: gun deaths in the 

491.24 492.53 A: here in in the whole world 

492.84 494.01 B: highest rate of what 

494.76 495.66 A: highest rate of gun 

495.81 496.46 A: gun deaths 

496.46 497.48 B: oh oh okay 

496.86 498.00 A: death by guns 

497.76 498.25 B: yeah yeah 

498.11 505.24 A: and i don't know just just like compared to everywhere else it's just it's just ridiculous 

499.09 499.73 B: that's true 

505.08 507.58 B: oh yeah that's totally true that's true right 

505.41 506.13 A: i 

514.02 514.77 A: it's just uh 

515.40 516.02 A: it's just uh 

516.58 517.07 A: horrible 

517.99 518.47 A: i don't know 

519.82 520.18 A: um 

523.50 525.56 B: yeah what you just said reminds me of 

525.75 526.97 B: one thing which i'm not 

527.10 528.44 B: definitely going to miss 

529.06 529.64 B: is that 

530.67 531.09 B: well 

531.65 532.79 B: i cannot go out 

533.05 534.44 B: at night by myself 

534.70 535.92 B: since i feel very 

534.86 535.33 A: right 

536.85 537.60 B: unsafe 

537.95 538.41 B: you know 

539.21 540.15 B: and um 

540.92 541.42 B: even 

541.60 542.15 B: just 

542.62 546.50 B: like after nine o'clock or something i don't dare to go out by myself 

546.86 547.17 A: yeah
