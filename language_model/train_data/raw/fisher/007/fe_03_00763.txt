13.61 19.99 B: i got part of the the message on the machine and i didn't get the rest we're suppose to be talking what about perjury 

19.85 25.47 A: if we would purger for a friend or a close family member yeah if we would lie in court 

27.30 30.09 B: it's interesting because i've been asked to do that 

29.71 31.14 A: oh really 

30.20 35.21 B: yeah and it really gave me a dilemma because it was for a close friend 

34.97 37.62 A: oh gosh i've never been in that position 

37.75 46.96 B: i hope you never are either because it really makes you look at your values and i decided against it and i had real problems with our friendship after that 

47.25 49.88 A: oh yeah i would imagine you would 

49.53 51.16 B: but it's one of those things where 

51.59 55.61 B: you have to live with yourself but you have to do what you think is right 

55.16 59.01 A: yeah that's all you can do with anything isn't it 

55.93 56.31 B: and it 

58.13 60.19 B: well y- you know it's interesting because 

60.30 61.05 B: it wasn't 

61.26 62.96 B: the type of situation 

63.24 64.03 B: where 

64.57 65.17 B: i felt 

65.90 67.86 B: consideration was really warranted 

68.72 77.67 B: uh and i said that because we had talked about it in terms of let's say somebody in the family had gotten murdered or really seriously injured and there was evidence that showed 

77.96 84.29 B: this had happened but through a technicality the person was going to get off unless a witness came up and said such and such 

84.63 85.61 A: oh i see 

85.02 87.55 B: and in that kind of a situation i might consider it 

87.95 88.69 A: yeah 

88.15 90.04 B: but it wasn't that kind of situation 

90.28 91.02 A: no 

92.97 96.22 B: sounds like something out of law and order on television doesn't it 

96.36 98.02 A: yeah it does it does 

98.64 99.61 A: i don't know i 

99.70 100.15 A: i 

100.44 106.37 A: i think if it was for a close friend or you know or for family member i i probably 

106.95 110.97 A: i don't know i it depends like you said it depends on the situation 

111.57 113.51 A: it depends on what is at stake 

113.31 117.94 B: it's hard because the the situation i was dealing with was um 

118.81 120.35 B: basically related to a divorce 

120.65 121.50 A: oh 

121.50 122.81 B: and it wasn't related to 

122.91 127.80 B: children or custody or something like that it was a property settlement 

125.99 126.75 A: oh yeah 

128.38 129.14 A: uh 

129.25 130.04 B: and i felt 

130.56 131.77 B: (( that )) anything that was 

132.43 135.84 B: that important and not that expensive could go out and get replaced 

136.67 137.62 B: you know whereas if you 

136.68 137.29 A: that's true 

137.86 139.29 B: compromise your integrity 

140.45 142.02 B: you can't replace that 

142.39 143.04 A: no 

143.47 144.75 A: no that's true 

144.26 151.48 B: and they do make you swear on the bible that that's what you're going to do in front of a whole group of people so it really makes you look at things that way 

151.64 152.42 A: yeah 

152.74 153.35 A: yeah 

154.33 155.71 A: yeah i've never had to go to 

155.94 158.48 A: court for anything yet i'm glad 

158.49 158.97 B: well it 

158.59 160.40 A: glad i've never had to testify 

160.71 164.89 B: well i've had to do that a couple of times and i found it very uncomfortable 

165.38 168.26 B: and i understand we're all suppose to do our patriotic duty 

168.80 173.87 B: and i agree with that but sometimes you can really put yourself in situations now where 

174.67 181.47 B: i mean it could be just the opposite too supposing it was a situation where um you were being threatened by someone and 

181.61 186.25 B: or your family was and your perjury was suppose to be i didn't see anything 

188.15 191.07 B: you know and if your family is at risk and you have to say i didn't s- 

191.19 191.95 B: see anything 

192.35 194.30 B: it would sure make you think about it because 

195.34 198.06 B: nobody is out there prot- to protect you or your family really 

198.61 199.32 A: no 

199.62 203.17 A: no and and you don't know what is going to happen once you get out of 

203.29 204.46 A: the court (( house )) 

203.99 205.48 B: exactly 

204.95 206.90 A: the court room oh gosh
