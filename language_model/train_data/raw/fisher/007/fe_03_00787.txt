194.00 194.86 B: internet sites 

195.06 196.18 B: design for those 

196.72 197.22 B: i might 

197.52 200.60 B: go into doing that kind of stuff but i'm not really sure right now 

202.03 202.55 A: that will be 

202.10 204.17 B: focusing on the internet because it's really becoming 

204.41 205.72 B: larger and larger everyday 

206.54 207.22 A: mhm 

207.98 213.34 A: i have like i created some sites of my own on the internet and i can't even figure out how to put clip art in them 

213.66 214.08 B: ha 

214.35 215.50 A: i can't figure it out 

215.96 221.99 A: for the life of me so like learn knowing how to do something like that i would just be in seventh heaven like going crazy on the computer 

223.14 224.27 A: i wouldn't know what to do 

226.94 229.12 B: there are certain (( length this needs to be or )) 

229.00 231.17 A: i haven't the faintest clue 

232.84 234.11 A: i have never done one of these 

236.07 237.26 B: hoping it actually pays off 

238.67 242.42 A: um i'm not sure if it i'm not sure if it does or not i hope it does 

243.92 244.35 A: um 

248.00 255.40 A: would you like (( )) where would you like would like have an off run it out of you house or would you i'm i'm just asking these questions because 

255.53 262.60 A: maybe that's what they want us to do would they like would you run it out of your house or would you like buy a building or how would you run it 

261.66 262.44 B: i would probably 

263.12 266.17 B: if i had the money i would probably actually do like a 

267.16 269.63 B: out of my house or actually i i would rather do the 

270.03 271.69 B: business thing have my own office and everything 

272.71 277.53 B: but you know you know renting and then power electricity everything else that's involved with that 

278.44 278.81 B: um 

278.47 280.08 A: that would be so expensive 

280.41 282.32 A: like because i know the stuff that my husband does 

282.62 283.48 A: we'd have to 

283.76 284.70 A: buy a garage 

285.01 286.20 A: we'd have to buy a 

286.37 290.13 A: like a couple of vehicles for we'd have to buy the system the system is 

290.40 294.06 A: like fifteen grand plus we'd have to buy the supplies for it 

294.43 294.79 B: yeah 

294.72 299.22 A: then like it uses a whole bunch of the electricity because you have to have heat lamps 

299.82 300.29 A: and all that 

300.46 300.98 A: stuff 

300.95 301.36 B: yeah 

301.79 302.56 A: it would be 

302.61 302.87 B: uh 

302.78 303.84 A: so expensive 

303.81 306.79 B: yeah hopefully in the end it might pay off but it might take a while 

307.35 307.77 A: um 

308.01 310.10 A: well i know like we've researched 

310.50 311.73 A: the job that he does 

312.22 312.79 A: and like 

312.98 313.98 A: a lot of people 

314.54 315.01 A: um 

315.42 316.57 A: who started it 

317.13 318.80 A: within their first year they make 

320.33 322.88 A: uh usually around two hundred grand 

323.06 323.91 B: wow that's pretty nice 

323.80 331.11 A: which isn't bad but then you also got to consider like what all they got to pay out and everything so like their actual 

331.25 331.75 A: um 

333.17 336.41 A: their actual take home is like maybe a hundred grand if that 

336.86 337.21 A: but that's 

337.32 340.29 A: still pretty decent because right now he's only working making like 

340.41 342.27 A: thirteen dollars an hour which ain't much 

342.69 343.05 B: yeah 

344.34 346.01 B: especially in this world and the economy 

350.36 354.42 A: i would love it if he had his own business i wouldn't have to work i could just work there take my kids 

355.04 357.35 A: down there have have a little playroom 

357.87 359.02 A: that would be so nice 

358.62 359.12 B: it would 

359.84 360.45 A: so nice 

363.48 365.42 B: so would would you have and office or would it 

365.97 366.43 A: um 

367.49 367.87 A: like 

368.01 369.05 A: what we would do is 

369.35 372.99 A: like how we would have the garage and then like we'd have like main like 
373.12 374.00 A: we'd have like 

374.30 376.97 A: the building with a garage and the n we'd have like an attached office 

377.51 378.85 A: offices to it 

379.49 381.45 A: and all that like to do all the financial 

382.03 382.86 A: and all that in 

382.99 383.29 A: if 

383.44 386.97 A: i mean i know how like in my mind how we would have it set up 

387.90 389.77 A: because it's it's like a really complex 

390.22 390.69 A: way 

390.96 393.11 A: and i can't even i can't explain it 

393.68 395.56 A: like in words for some reason it's just 

396.13 398.70 A: i can see it in my mind but i can't speak it 

398.42 399.06 B: yeah yeah yeah 

399.16 401.30 A: but it would it would just be so awesome like 

401.81 402.77 A: the way we would do it 

403.59 403.93 A: and i 

404.87 407.26 A: one of these days eventually we're going to be able to 

413.10 414.32 B: i really don't know what to do i've 

415.90 417.25 A: i hear you on that one 

419.39 420.69 B: i was assuming it was like a 

421.88 423.17 B: a recorded thing and 

425.39 426.23 B: whatever i don't know 

426.82 430.31 A: i get what you're saying like it would come on and say okay you're done now
