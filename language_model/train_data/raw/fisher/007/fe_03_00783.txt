51.70 53.32 A: you're right 

55.00 56.50 A: (( oh is that where you're from ))

84.20 86.97 B: i can do that for ten bucks too [laughter]

101.91 103.27 A: right 

102.66 109.76 B: so unless you really had a good something to pull the people in like sales or you know just something that would pull them in 

109.76 118.42 A: i wonder how successful i would actually be if i had to motivate myself to get up and go to work in the morning [laughter] if i didn't have to

227.29 231.63 B: the wild ones yeah they're just kinda oh and you always want to tame 'em and stuff but 

231.50 235.71 B: once they get the get out there especially male cats 

235.03 236.19 A: yes 

235.55 247.86 B: yeah i've lost so many male cats because they hit that age that certain age and they're ready they're gone they're grown up they know it all they're just like a kid you know they know it all they're out of here i might see you once or twice when i come to eat and that's it 

245.32 246.91 A: (( [laughter] )) 

247.25 248.72 A: yeah there you go 

248.10 255.95 B: yeah so i i decided yeah i'd definitely have i had a male cat we'd have him neutered that way he'd be chilled out and calm down but if 

255.07 256.89 A: oh yeah 

256.29 259.94 B: but females i had them and i ended up with twenty one cats one time 

259.77 261.27 A: oh no 

260.65 273.73 B: yes it was i mean she was just like boom she'd get knocked up and then i was like you know yeah i'm not letting you out for at least two years and she'd get out i wouldn't see her she'd come back she'd be knocked up again i'd say i'm not even done getting rid of your other cats 

267.09 267.92 A: [laughter] 

270.46 271.47 A: oh 

273.61 278.49 A: that's what happens to us down here i mean the one that we have in the office we just kinda 

278.57 283.24 A: tamed it brought it in but the rest are just wild 

282.41 290.90 B: yes yes see and th- that's that's you know the hardest thing is when you do get some and you're just like oh what have i done 

290.60 293.91 A: no that's what i think it's like oh no [laughter] 

293.14 303.96 B: people called me the cat lady i was like oh come on thirty one years old i'm not you know i'm not this old crippled woman with a bunch of cats i got kids too you know [laughter]

311.13 313.04 B: wow that's weird 

312.45 315.69 A: i don't even remember how long it was supposed to be or 

315.73 327.33 B: me neither i don't and that was like the that was the question an- and fifty fifty chance of being successful around here um i say yes only 'cause you have to be optimistic if you do anything like that 

326.95 328.29 A: yeah 

327.62 334.02 B: but to be reality is the way the war and everything the economy we probably wouldn't make it 

333.37 343.48 A: right and there's pr- oil yeah yeah if you could come up with i don't know something really special that no one had thought up yet to make 

342.85 344.88 B: that would be a good idea 

344.23 345.70 A: yeah 

345.04 359.52 B: i'm always going through these magazines and th- th- there are these off print magazines and they're coming up with these you know just little knickknack that helps you in the kitchen and stuff like that and i'd say now why in the heck didn't i think of that one [laughter] exactly [laughter]

355.56 358.49 A: (( these people are going to be rich and you're just trying to )) 

358.62 363.23 A: think of this this this idea that no one has thought up yet and 

363.38 364.75 A: it's like [sigh] 

364.62 375.71 B: invention that's my my husband he is the inventor he's just constantly he's coming up with them and it's like yeah okay now i have all these inventions that you've come up with and i'm behind you on maybe 

375.63 381.21 B: n- less than half of 'em [laughter] [laughter] the other ones i think are a little over the top 

377.47 378.77 A: [laughter] 

380.36 381.98 A: [laughter] 

381.31 387.03 B: but ah now where do we go from there then you have to go get somebody to patent it who isn't going to steal your idea 

386.36 387.81 A: right 

387.19 393.40 B: or say oh it's already been done and then next year here's your product you know you can't trust these companies 

390.28 391.24 A: yeah 

392.78 394.18 A: [laughter] 

393.59 400.85 B: i'm just like paul what are you going to do now you know [laughter] you're going to keep on driving a truck is what you're going to keep doing [laughter] 

396.32 397.31 A: (( exactly i'd )) 

400.13 406.54 A: say the price of rent in any place that's in the tourist center would be just outrageous 

405.94 418.51 B: it is even thrift stores they have thrift stores down here and i'm talking because i love clothes and and um these you know and there's like at least seven just in in my area you know which and they're i'm like well there's so many

425.97 427.26 A: (( so )) 

426.85 433.38 B: i'm like okay maybe the summer time you could actually make a profit but during the winter you're you're lucky if you break even then 

432.89 434.01 A: (( i asked )) 

434.10 435.04 A: (( the lady )) 

434.98 437.69 B: ah no i wish i did but i

439.34 440.31 A: (( you )) 

448.14 449.13 A: (( know )) 

451.67 458.00 B: (( stuck together [laughter] [sigh] i do i mean i can do it but i will spend a fortune making something and i just don't see you know making a profit on it [laughter] )) 

451.69 452.52 A: (( she'd just )) 

457.93 461.61 A: (( opened it and i was like are you making a profit off this she goes well she goes )) 

461.67 463.47 A: (( to be honest we're like breaking even )) 

463.60 466.50 A: (( right now oh yeah do you craft a lot yeah yeah )) 

466.46 468.02 B: true true 

467.47 472.62 A: or selling it you know after you spend all that time making something selling it 

472.78 475.63 A: for you know what it's worth to you 

474.93 482.29 B: right because to you it's more because you put your hands your yeah your right your time all that into it and you're not going to want to let it go cheap 

482.62 491.10 B: but i did find this company that for fourteen ninety nine and i think the cheapest when it's on sale it's nine ninety nine it's a little magazine it's called collections

499.69 501.31 A: [laughter] 

508.04 513.79 B: but um i really you know and they just they must make a lot of money selling it that cheap 

513.45 514.66 A: right 

514.02 520.85 B: and i think that's why th- th- they're becoming so successful is because they don't nothing's over fourteen ninety nine in the magazine 

520.59 522.04 A: oh okay 

521.10 524.21 B: yeah everything in the magazine's fourteen ninety nine
