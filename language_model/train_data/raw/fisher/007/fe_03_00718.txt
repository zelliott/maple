236.17 237.11 A: right 

237.32 238.65 A: what would you do 

239.69 240.77 B: um 

243.15 246.00 A: children would be the first thought sheltering them 

244.53 252.96 B: yeah first thing you got to figure out where they are and make sure they're safe then try to figure out what is going on [noise] you know where is it happening at 

255.60 259.25 A: do you need to take further shelter do you need to 

256.37 258.71 B: [noise]

292.04 295.82 B: yeah most of the time it's just me and the boys 

295.28 298.39 A: so let me ask a question i think they'll ask you 

298.50 300.10 A: um how old are you 

300.12 301.51 B: i'm seventeen 

301.26 302.90 A: you're seventeen

311.52 312.43 B: [laughter] 

314.73 316.70 A: that happened you know 

316.87 321.57 A: if you were around in new york when that did happen what would be the first thing you would do 

323.81 326.32 A: do you have a vehicle of escape 

325.17 327.21 B: (( [laughter] )) 

327.26 329.17 B: well yeah 

330.01 331.25 B: i would well 

332.28 336.06 B: hopefully they wouldn't lock down the base or anything 

336.27 337.65 B: and then 

337.51 340.20 A: now there's there's your support group 

339.63 342.09 B: [laughter] yeah 

340.51 341.54 A: (( [laughter] )) 

342.82 345.78 B: (( 'cause i know any of the winners and recent )) 

346.08 351.30 B: things where there maybe terrorism [noise] they've locked down the base and no one can get off or 

351.33 352.38 A: right 

351.47 352.23 B: (( on )) 

352.30 365.28 B: so it means there's a way i'd get back down to delaware you know be with my family make sure everything's going good and uh i guess basically try to escape out of whatever we just got done experiencing 

359.34 360.77 A: right 

365.31 376.51 B: you know try to grab a grips of everything that had happened but if not i guess we'd end up over at the family services building here on base with everyone else 

378.71 379.79 A: (( mhm )) 

379.13 379.97 B: (( huh )) 

380.51 384.02 A: i think that terrorism has really affected our economy 

385.44 391.28 B: it's affected just about everything i think the way people think [noise] the way they act with each other 

391.11 392.06 A: yeah 

393.24 397.42 B: [noise] it's supposed to tear us apart but in many ways it brought us all together 

397.25 398.26 A: (( uh-hum )) 

399.98 401.48 B: [noise] 

400.85 402.07 A: (( i don't know )) 

403.29 405.17 B: (( uh-hum )) 

403.80 409.09 A: example we just had a a plant over here in north carolina blow up 

407.09 408.30 B: (( hm )) 

409.59 411.29 A: eight people died 

412.92 418.31 A: unfortunately but if your first reaction is was it terrorism 

417.91 419.33 B: exactly 

419.95 430.98 B: [noise] that's why my husband is an m._p. so he's at the gates you know checking everyone that comes in and i [noise] was asking him would do they act any different to the people from the middle east and stuff 

430.92 439.83 B: and he claims they don't but in my opinion this [noise] right being an american if i was an m._p. i'd probably would question it a little more 

439.65 441.54 A: right 

440.00 443.58 B: just because that's the first ones that you would suspect 

444.08 451.43 B: even though now they're showing that it's blacks and whites and you know people right here in america that are involved with it too 

451.89 456.45 B: but i guess it's because it you know most of it is pointed to the middle east 

456.59 458.90 B: so i would question that a lot 

461.08 462.03 A: (( hm )) 

462.05 464.29 A: you know but you think 

464.54 465.37 A: i keep 

465.61 467.39 A: thinking back to 

468.23 473.55 A: i can sit over here in north carolina and play with my computer and i can do this 

473.45 474.84 B: (( mhm [noise] )) 

473.97 474.74 A: but 

475.21 477.49 A: how long has your husband been in there 

477.34 483.03 B: he's been in for almost two years now he was in training when september eleventh happened 

483.56 484.97 A: wow 

484.25 487.07 B: [laughter] [noise] yeah i was a friend 

487.08 493.46 B: of because some of my friends had also been in training and i just knew everyone was going to be deployed 

493.95 497.43 B: and then two months after he got out of training he got deployed 

497.96 499.69 A: oh wow 

499.02 500.03 B: (( [laughter] )) 

500.04 503.68 A: so i can go in my little world i see it on the news 

503.42 504.72 B: mhm 

504.97 505.82 B: but it's 

505.74 508.55 A: it's not reality it's reality to you 

508.07 509.68 B: yeah 

510.27 515.50 A: i mean it's not just i'm thinking about how is it going to affect the economy 

515.73 517.50 A: and you're thinking is 

516.54 517.69 B: [noise] 

517.64 519.48 A: well what are you thinking 

520.67 525.32 B: well right now with iraq i'm thinking will he go how would it affect the children 

525.97 530.04 B: because even our older son took it hard when he went away when he went away for the training 

531.33 535.68 B: and ah he came back and he didn't want nothing to do with daddy he thought he left him 

535.80 537.20 A: (( mhm ah )) 

536.63 538.09 B: (( so [laughter] )) 

538.43 544.77 B: that's my biggest thing i can deal with being alone and being with the two children raising them on my own you know 'cause 

544.72 553.63 B: i married into this this is what i got basically you know i understand that so my main concerns are how will all this affect the children 

553.82 554.85 A: right 

554.11 558.83 B: and when they get older i just hope that things are better than they are now 

558.20 562.04 A: do you have uh other young ladies over there 

561.83 567.18 B: [noise] no the youngest ones i've met are like twenty five with children 

562.07 563.36 A: as friends 

567.92 573.02 B: most of them are in their thirties and forties with children at the same age as mine 

574.05 574.81 A: (( mm )) 

574.52 577.11 B: [laughter] 

576.48 579.23 A: well you might find somebody to talk to now 

580.44 585.28 B: well i guess it's kinda hard because me being young i kind of stick out of everything 

585.54 587.56 A: well do remember 

587.80 591.66 A: the terrorism has brought a lot of people back to church 

591.54 593.06 B: yeah 

592.52 595.95 A: i hadn't gone for twelve years 

594.71 595.52 B: (( [noise] ))
