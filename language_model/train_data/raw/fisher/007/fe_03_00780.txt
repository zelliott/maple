26.57 26.88 A: oh 

27.04 27.34 A: nice 

27.19 27.71 B: um 

27.88 28.86 B: like one of those little book 

28.95 29.96 B: stores um i'm not 

30.10 32.20 B: too not too much a fan of the big um 

33.28 34.92 B: corporations like barnes and noble or 

35.69 36.44 B: borders (( where it's )) 

36.17 36.60 A: borders 

36.71 37.71 B: kind of impersonal 

38.34 38.75 A: uh-huh 

39.94 42.02 B: obviously if money wasn't an object 

42.19 44.44 A: no they made that clear 

43.01 43.43 B: and what 

43.96 47.14 B: yeah i know it wouldn't matter if you lost money or not but um 

47.80 53.43 B: yeah i think that would be kind of interesting -cause i i very rarely now get a chance to read with my two my two little ones 

54.50 55.98 B: i think it would be kind of relaxing 

59.01 63.92 A: yeah and you just sit there i i mean i really used to like going to like used book stores and 

63.68 64.16 B: mhm 

64.48 65.87 A: when i went to college i 

65.97 71.92 A: spent a lot of time there and i found out about a lot of authors that i never would have any other way 

71.75 72.77 B: oh yeah definitely 

73.01 75.19 A: bring in whole collections of things and 

75.07 75.50 B: mhm 

75.41 76.90 A: and you get to talk to some of the 

77.06 77.59 A: smaller 

78.00 80.86 A: you know if they were a smaller company you get to talk to the people that own it and 

80.74 81.56 B: oh definitely 

81.12 81.39 A: it was 

81.84 85.80 A: look for things for you if you found something you needed (( )) and 

86.89 90.10 A: it's really nice -cause i have a big collection that i haven't even read yet -cause 

90.50 91.01 B: me too 

90.77 91.18 A: (( )) 

91.36 94.88 A: especially once i got my computer like nothing else matters 

94.61 95.84 B: yeah i know right 

95.98 100.26 A: i'm online all the time you know and i try to do all these survey things and 

100.19 100.70 B: mhm 

101.13 106.59 A: i think my business would be something to do with helping people finance (( )) things because 

107.15 109.57 A: i don't know where i would set it up probably online 

109.77 110.27 B: right 

110.26 111.44 A: um there are some 

111.60 112.14 A: places 

112.26 112.66 A: um 

113.16 114.79 A: for that have help desks 

115.32 116.32 A: things like people 

117.00 119.30 A: uh write in any kind of topic and find 

119.74 120.17 A: where 

120.45 121.69 A: get answers to it and 

122.01 126.42 A: i'm really good at writing complaint letters to companies and try to 

126.70 127.54 A: help people that 

127.70 129.68 A: don't have the proper skills to do that 

129.63 130.20 B: right 

130.56 131.46 A: (( )) 

131.92 135.64 A: and i've been pretty successful with the better business bureau and 

135.82 136.44 B: right 

135.89 137.55 A: sometimes directly to the company 

137.75 139.61 B: that sounds very interesting and it probably 

139.80 142.96 B: is i know if the money was no object but it would probably be a low cost 
143.83 144.82 B: business i would think 

145.41 145.79 A: mhm 

147.19 148.12 A: especially you know if you 

148.25 152.74 A: i don't know how to set up a web-page though but i know you can hire people to do that for you so 

152.97 154.29 B: i know they actually have um 

154.98 155.69 B: i have a (( )) 

161.29 162.04 B: lots of um

181.09 184.24 A: i forget did you find out about this through 

184.50 185.32 A: big big savings

190.03 191.24 A: doing anything about it 

191.35 197.50 A: i think big big savings was the first one -cause they have a lot of posts about it and that is where i found out people were starting to get the calls and 

197.27 197.75 B: mhm 

198.25 199.92 A: what times they were coming in and everything 

200.12 200.78 B: well it sounded pretty 

200.29 200.76 A: i'm glad 

201.04 202.41 B: yeah it sounded pretty interesting 

203.50 206.99 A: you know and so it was what i was able to switch it over -cause i e. mailed twice and 

207.29 208.66 A: the robot kept calling me 

208.92 211.74 A: uh every half hour the first day after they gave me 

211.90 212.29 A: pin 

212.73 214.62 A: and i was trying to tell them i couldn't 

214.93 223.95 A: press anything on my rotary phone and then finally last week when it rang again i called up and there was somebody on the other end and i told them my 

224.08 225.12 A: (( predicament but )) 

225.23 231.10 A: (( )) but like if they don't pay i'm going to be screwed because this is twenty five cents a minute on here 

231.17 232.01 B: oh no 

231.49 234.56 A: but just for sitting on hold waiting for them to find you 

234.43 235.10 B: yeah 

235.10 236.15 A: will cost me time 

236.26 238.25 A: and i have to make sure it's uh recharged now 

236.86 237.42 B: oh goodness 

240.14 240.73 B: um

259.72 260.19 B: mhm 

260.34 262.09 A: that is a really good job i don't think i'd 

262.48 264.44 A: want to even run my own business unless 

264.55 265.39 A: for some reason 

265.55 267.29 A: i didn't have that job anymore 

267.00 267.67 B: yeah 

268.72 269.44 B: so they said w- 

268.77 269.61 A: i didn't know any 

270.08 271.62 B: so they said money was no object 

272.13 272.52 A: right 

273.34 273.75 B: um 

273.73 277.58 A: yeah i do like sitting at home and doing things and i would like to do a home business 

279.04 282.73 A: try to find a natural location to set things up and be (( )) 

284.21 286.04 A: the (( )) part of town or whatever 

284.79 285.47 B: yeah 

291.54 292.35 B: well that is true

295.78 296.03 A: yeah 

299.42 302.51 A: yeah i wouldn't even really think of amazon as a bookstore anymore i mean it 

302.60 303.80 A: started that way but 

303.59 306.21 B: yeah well they've got other they have other things they branched 

306.32 306.94 B: out and then 

307.03 307.64 A: ever since 

308.02 308.45 A: even 

308.67 311.06 A: uh merged or whatever with c._d. now 

311.99 313.88 A: i was shocked -cause they had some gift certificates 

314.00 315.07 A: there that i didn't 

315.42 320.71 A: remember to use and then all of sudden i clicked on it to go on and it took me right to amazon 

321.58 322.63 A: the only option now is 

322.77 325.66 A: to transfer these over to promotional amazon gift 

325.88 326.24 A: certificates 

326.62 329.32 B: oh i would just i would just wonder if they would even be 

330.92 332.52 B: a market niche for a small 

333.14 334.49 B: small book outlet online 

335.10 335.99 A: yeah i don't know how 

335.31 335.67 B: (( )) 

336.12 337.65 A: you would be able to promote it 

338.31 338.84 B: yeah 

338.32 338.94 A: (( once )) 

339.55 341.92 A: get enough people interested in it so that you would 

342.18 343.65 A: make some money out of it 

343.52 344.82 B: well you probably would have to 

344.98 346.81 B: ha- and be able to do it and get up 

354.62 356.87 A: yeah would you want to specialize in certain books 

357.59 358.13 B: um 

359.62 360.52 B: i don't think so 

362.29 365.49 B: i mean i h- obviously have my favorites of what i like to read but 

365.47 365.85 A: mhm 

367.25 368.34 B: i just remember 

371.15 371.88 B: environmental books 

376.24 376.80 B: that we are out of 

377.81 379.29 B: and they were really good about 

380.16 380.72 B: ordering them 

399.69 400.12 B: for 

400.67 401.77 B: while i think about it 

401.98 402.27 B: -cause 

402.85 403.59 B: personal book- 

403.70 404.87 B: store because it might it's 

405.36 405.75 B: pretty hard 

406.04 406.48 B: (( )) with 

407.90 409.13 B: such a large corporation 

409.63 410.02 A: yeah 

410.29 413.81 B: probably why a lot of the uh mom and pop hardware stores are going out of business 

415.80 416.19 B: (( )) 

421.32 422.66 B: probably the best thing was the 

422.77 423.76 B: personalized service 

425.64 428.90 A: yeah it is like even the big bookstore (( )) went out of business 

429.00 429.35 A: too 

430.14 430.55 B: really 

430.63 431.16 A: with their

432.57 434.06 A: (( )) borders 

434.06 434.45 B: borders

437.53 437.99 A: yeah

441.90 444.21 A: and i know some of our malls closed even so 

442.22 442.78 B: but i think that's 

445.14 447.21 B: but i think that that is pretty much the only book 

454.38 456.13 B: i remember growing up that you 

456.34 458.14 B: see a lot more like i said mom and pop 

459.21 459.63 A: mhm 

463.33 465.97 A: right most of those are now just used bookstores 

466.15 467.22 B: yeah just used book- 

469.50 471.81 A: and there is a lot of them in college towns like 

471.20 471.71 B: (( )) 

474.60 477.91 A: i don't know how they would make money on like a text bookstore because 

477.79 478.46 B: yeah 

478.32 481.91 A: oh they go out of print so fast they have updated versions of them all the time
