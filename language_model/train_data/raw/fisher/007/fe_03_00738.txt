0.97 3.10 B: hell- hi my name's paul 

2.82 4.81 A: hi um ed 

5.15 6.38 B: hey ed how are you 

6.31 7.51 A: i'm good how are you 

7.59 11.26 B: i'm good so i've never done these before 

10.93 15.43 A: uh me neither so i guess we're supposed to talk about comedy 

15.38 18.63 B: and how you draw the line okay um 

18.94 20.43 B: well i guess 

20.75 23.73 B: the line is probably uh 

24.17 26.06 B: the use of like 

26.10 27.55 B: stereotyping 

27.82 29.28 B: (( so i probably i don't [noise] )) 

28.05 29.17 A: well 

29.21 37.98 A: i don't know personally i i don't really take things too seriously um i'm asian and um 

38.69 46.04 A: and um i don't know if you heard shaq comments a couple of weeks ago or a couple of months ago 

44.24 45.17 B: no 

46.09 50.12 A: he was talking about yao ming the china center the guy 

50.19 60.92 A: and uh he makes um some some ching chang chong chok something like that that uh to simulate ah chinese pronunciation 

50.26 51.86 B: right 

61.16 68.08 A: um and a lot of people just got really angry yeah 

61.31 62.44 B: (( i see )) 

67.63 72.73 B: oh that's interesting 'cause i guess sort of i'm just a nice sort of 

72.78 73.70 B: so i thought 

73.98 76.67 B: one of those people that suffers from political 

77.14 79.49 B: so maybe i get too um 

79.88 87.70 B: [lipsmack] too concerned for people you know i guess that's interesting sort of ask almost the people like you know an asian person if this is 

88.08 91.28 B: to 'em because it doesn't offend the people that 

91.32 95.90 B: making fun of then why should it offend everyone else right 

94.91 104.47 A: yeah i mean it's really a fine line it's really hard to determine 'cause i mean what i find offensive might not be offensive to you 

104.65 105.54 B: right 

104.77 112.34 A: and what you find offensive you know might not be offensive to me so i'm i mean 

109.27 110.03 B: right 

112.69 113.51 A: to 

113.31 127.73 A: i guess you know some commercials for example they take it real conservative and just throw out some stupid humor or some try to push the envelope and you know people get get offended 

127.53 128.95 A: (( uh )) 

127.68 132.88 B: well that's true yeah yeah so it's almost like you know if it's if it's not smart 

133.24 136.37 B: it's definitely offensive [laughter] so it's sort of 

137.06 139.76 B: funny yeah yeah 

137.15 145.44 A: right right so i don't know if we'll ever be able to find a a true definition 

145.85 148.17 A: of of where the line stands 

148.97 151.98 B: well it's in it's sort of like um 

152.78 155.23 B: [lipsmack] you know the supreme court when it comes to 

155.46 163.00 B: obscenities pornography obscenities it's sort of a it's sort of we don't know what it isn't yet so it's sort of like 

157.72 159.91 A: oh yeah yeah 

162.74 172.74 A: right right i think um for uh pornography or obscenity though even a little bit more clear cut than than offensive humor 

173.40 178.94 A: (( you know because pornography you can see it it's black or white pretty much )) 

178.30 192.88 B: right right right but yeah all i meant was yeah you're right in terms of offensive humor it's also well i guess the other thing they talk about with pornography is the community standards so it's sort of like in this case it's sort each person's standards so um 

187.33 189.17 A: (( right right [mn] by )) 

193.46 196.53 B: you know like sein- i don't know if you watch seinfeld and you know and there 

196.60 198.43 B: (( and george is )) 

198.54 203.13 B: going down the street in his little motorized wheel chair being chased 

204.52 206.86 A: (( other people in motorized wheelchairs so like yeah i saw )) 

204.58 212.34 B: who i think that's i mean i think that's funny but maybe somebody who's sitting in a motorized wheelchair wouldn't but yeah well 

211.02 214.23 A: (( that that was that was hilarious [laughter] )) 

215.16 217.78 A: yeah yeah you know some people some people 

216.51 217.14 B: (( i )) 

217.95 220.13 A: could find it offensive i suppose 

221.54 223.51 B: find what's interesting is sort of like 

223.65 227.23 B: you know about shaq's comments there'll always be 

228.65 237.06 B: somebody that wants to say they're representing everyone they'll be the asian american anti defamation league or something and that'll be 

236.36 238.13 A: right 

237.82 243.04 B: that'll be somebody who wants to get on their soapbox 'cause they want their fifteen minutes of 

243.10 253.60 B: attention to say how offensive he is and he should apologize and da da you know it's interesting that whatever group is being whether it's polish or 

253.93 262.71 B: whatever it is somebody is willing to sort of stand up and say hey hey you know i speak on behalf of these people and you know you've real but 

262.78 266.10 B: oftentimes those kind of people are just in it 

266.81 271.19 A: yeah yeah i it's i 

266.83 268.20 B: glory you know 

271.20 278.73 A: mean most times when when when i find some situations like that i just tell people you know just lighten up you know 

278.75 284.40 A: i mean some some things are just not worth getting offended by you know it's 

284.56 289.74 A: life is too short to to really take everything so seriously 

289.76 291.91 B: but then don't you think it's also 

292.22 293.37 B: when you're 

294.47 308.68 B: a group like there's certain words that you could use that you wouldn't want to hear a white person use like stuff like even in a like i think about like richard prior you know used the word 

308.94 321.54 B: you know nigger but that's a wo- you know that and that was okay but i guess if a white person in a comedy used it 'cause i guess there's all that extra stuff that goes along with it if you're not part of the group then are 

321.56 322.33 B: you 

322.37 324.02 B: using it in a yeah 

322.73 323.80 A: (( i )) 

323.92 327.02 A: mean that's to me it's kind of hypocritical you know 

327.61 336.65 A: i mean you know chinese i'm chinese and uh i guess the term is chinkster or chink you know 

336.54 348.31 A: and and i mean if people use it i don't really get that i don't really get offended but it's if people are going to tell me hey you can use it but you know people of the other race can't use it 

348.31 352.26 A: then i mean that that's just stupid 

352.37 364.60 A: you know if it's a derogatory term then it's a derogatory term it's not funny it's not funny you can't say oh if i say it's funny then if you say it then it's not funny you know i don't think that just makes 

365.17 366.58 A: everything 

367.00 368.77 A: even more blurry i guess 

368.53 378.02 B: [noise] right right but i guess you know it's interesting 'cause um last night i was speaking of comedy drawing the line [laughter] last night i happened to go see joan rivers 

377.87 378.69 A: (( mm )) 

378.72 381.00 A: [laughter] 

380.25 381.23 B: (( you know and )) 

381.57 389.04 B: but it's am- in person you know it's amazing 'cause fir- she just every other word is a cuss word which is so surprising 

387.18 388.65 A: [laughter] 

389.29 394.82 B: and close to seventy and she's saying f-ing this and f-ing that and but that a lot of 

396.95 400.30 B: um but she talks about specific 

401.11 408.00 B: famous people whether it's jackie kennedy or taylor or chelsea clinton 

408.27 409.21 B: uh 

409.25 410.30 B: so do you 

410.88 418.77 B: do you think that somebody who's in the public eye is kind of has to be more willing to be a target of that kind of humor or 

418.82 420.80 A: uh-huh i i think they're 

420.88 425.58 A: if you're in the public eye i don't think there's any way you can 

425.79 427.17 A: get away with that 

427.27 434.13 A: you know uh if you're in the public eye people are interested and you will be the target 

434.39 435.70 B: right 

435.21 437.74 A: (( you know i don't think there's any way of getting around it )) 

438.05 447.55 B: well i guess what's interesting she did say that she left chelsea clinton alone when she was a kid but now that she's grown [laughter] bec- it's also because i guess somebody like chelsea clinton who 

443.09 443.97 A: right 

448.26 454.70 B: do anything except be born to those people it's not fair [noise] i always remember on 

451.59 452.34 A: yeah 

454.76 456.86 B: saturday night live when 

457.24 460.24 B: the clintons and gore's were nominated and they 

460.36 462.44 B: you know they they had these 

462.37 476.23 B: gorgeous girls playing the gore girls and then they had i think they might have even had a guy play chelsea you know and it was really i mean it was funny but you did feel sorry for her because she's i thought here's this awkward teenage girl 

468.08 469.44 A: [laughter] 

476.32 489.42 B: and yet it is funny you know but it's it's also because she hasn't put herself in the public eye and i remember at the time like hilary clinton had complained about it and then i think most people did back off but it's like sort of like 

488.07 489.03 A: (( mhm )) 

489.45 494.89 B: th- the bush girls i mean here you know again like those you know so they have a drink or so they do 

495.34 508.75 B: only it's the they're on letterman and leno monologues and so i guess it's when you're if you're if it's if it's by association i think that's probably when people would say and that's not really fair but i guess it's also 

499.95 501.16 A: right right 

508.64 514.34 B: like what you were just i mean it's but if it's i guess if it's it's funny it's funny you know 

514.45 516.69 A: yeah i mean 

516.79 518.89 A: i just think people just 

519.01 521.56 A: take things a little bit too seriously 

521.80 524.07 B: yeah especially when it's supposed to be 

524.36 528.42 B: comedy now what do you think about though when they do 

529.21 532.95 B: (( well i guess it's what they they like a black comedy like )) 

533.49 536.60 B: about death or 

537.09 538.86 B: like is that 

538.91 543.79 B: is it different rules or is it just always still just oh if it makes you laugh it makes you laugh i mean 

543.63 552.96 A: i mean yeah i watched let's say black comedy shows and if there was a white dude up there talking the same material 

552.86 553.70 B: uh-huh 

553.03 555.57 A: i think he would be stoned to death already 

554.43 555.21 B: (( sorry )) 

555.51 562.07 B: when i said black comedy i meant like um not about black people i meant black comedy is an expression that means about um 

562.22 563.15 A: oh 

562.24 566.05 B: just like you you know when like making like death like did you see 

565.62 566.76 A: (( black humor )) 

566.78 571.07 B: black humor yeah black exactly like national lampoon vacation where 

567.86 569.26 A: oh okay uh 

573.92 580.74 B: and 'cause she dies in the back of the car but they keep driving so they just tie her to the top of the roof 

580.54 583.98 A: i think black humor is um 

584.38 585.47 A: even 

585.45 599.89 A: riskier as in uh a lot more people are gonna get offended i i remember um i went to see a play in a one of those small community uh kind of theatres and um it was um 

589.13 590.03 B: right 

596.95 598.06 B: uh-huh
