140.35 141.74 B: it's very scary 

148.91 154.60 B: to this world and i don't think bush is doing a very good job of handling this and

166.00 166.71 A: yeah 

167.60 174.60 A: he's not handling it the he the way i believe he should there are other things he could do besides going to war 

174.83 175.82 B: exactly 

176.91 181.56 B: exactly i think he's trying to make up for what his father did not do 

181.76 182.36 A: yeah 

183.15 185.73 B: which is not particularly good 

184.14 189.33 A: yeah he's got to def- got to defend his father's honor why let him do it 

189.58 190.20 B: right 

191.86 192.93 B: that's true 

193.66 198.19 B: but i'm not looking forward to a war i hope and pray that it th- 

197.57 199.14 A: i don't think anyone is 

199.46 201.47 B: i hope it doesn't go there 

203.75 205.47 B: i hope it does not go there 

204.07 204.93 A: same here

218.91 221.11 B: i think it's a pharmaceutical company 

223.69 225.62 A: well i hadn't heard anything about it so 

223.81 224.57 B: and it 

226.05 226.66 B: oh 

227.38 229.33 B: it was all over the news today 

230.45 237.01 A: i didn't watch the news i not today anyway i caught the state of the union last night and i was just wondering 

237.50 237.82 A: o- 

237.94 240.30 A: kay now he's going to try and do what 

240.75 243.46 B: mhm oh you watched the address 

243.46 244.04 A: yeah 

244.55 245.85 B: what did you think of it 

246.95 249.19 A: uh it's just 

250.83 253.49 A: some of the stuff that he mentioned in it is just 

254.06 256.63 A: i can't believe that he's actually going to do this 

257.22 257.92 B: hm 

257.25 260.12 A: going to force our beliefs again it's just 

260.45 262.61 A: inviting a whole new world of hurt 

262.87 263.40 A: on us 

263.87 264.78 B: mm 

266.64 269.79 B: that's why i didn't watch it because i 

270.22 273.81 B: i feel like he's making a lot of promises that he can't keep 

274.01 275.89 A: well that's what every politician does 

276.08 276.92 B: yeah 

277.82 280.60 B: but the president you expect a little bit more 

280.82 281.68 A: yeah 

281.77 284.31 B: i thought clinton was a very good president 

284.43 288.18 A: yeah clinton's y- at the lowest point of clinton's thing 

288.36 290.45 A: he had an approval rating of eighty percent 

290.81 291.54 B: yeah 

292.15 296.08 A: that that wa- that is s- something that everyone dreams for when they are in politics 

296.64 299.70 A: right now bush has got in the mid fifties 

299.79 301.64 A: it's not that good 

302.51 302.85 A: his 

302.97 303.33 A: best 

303.44 305.63 A: wa- hi- his best was clinton's worst 

306.27 306.93 B: yeah 

307.25 312.68 B: i don't know if you like reagan but h- he reminds me of reagan 

312.80 314.49 B: when reagan was in office 

315.18 319.16 A: everyone has their e- everyone has their own thing when it comes to politics 

320.02 321.10 A: personally 

322.94 326.35 A: uh you can't trust them as far as you can throw them is that's my th- 

326.79 327.13 A: sentiment 

326.92 328.05 B: exactly 

329.11 330.15 B: exactly 

330.34 332.11 B: i agree with you 

332.98 336.73 B: so we're supposed to talk for ten minutes about terrorism 

338.26 339.23 A: okay 

339.26 342.56 B: well 

343.20 346.19 B: this is something i'm not looking forward to 

346.37 357.69 B: but in a way i believe that america will overcome because there is no way they have the kind of power that we have as far as 

347.70 348.74 A: i- it's just 

358.47 365.57 B: military and equipment our men are trained and disciplined to protect us 

365.38 365.68 A: we- 

365.86 368.20 A: um talking about that um 

368.66 379.44 A: actually the terr- the terrorists they can disappear and reappear in different locations th- they're completely mobile it's this is a whole new war 

380.94 382.91 A: i don't think we're quite ready for it yet 

384.94 389.93 B: someone made a statement to me that this reminds them of desert storm 

390.34 390.67 A: (( well )) 

391.00 392.45 A: um desert storm 

392.99 394.73 A: kind of like it but 

395.32 401.24 A: uh this is going to be in the entire world the there it's not going to be in one country in that 

401.65 405.12 A: it's going to be the entire world i don't think we're quite ready for it 

405.58 406.69 B: where do you l- 

405.68 406.62 A: to fight 

407.31 408.07 B: okay 

408.91 409.61 B: continue 

410.20 412.87 A: i i just don't think we're quite ready to fight this 

412.97 413.88 A: th- this thing 

414.51 415.00 A: because 

416.22 419.89 A: these these are small groups of peop- dedicated people 

420.82 421.38 A: um 

422.39 422.72 A: they 

423.01 424.37 A: could cons-

440.84 441.81 A: military 

443.30 448.16 B: oh you mean how they're they're willing to die for their beliefs 

447.92 448.77 A: yes 

449.35 452.35 B: yeah that's one thing i admired about them 

453.37 455.81 B: they didn't even care that they were going to die 

457.19 459.01 B: it's all about their beliefs 

458.95 459.42 A: yeah 

460.80 461.76 B: mm 

462.87 465.10 B: well this is something that
