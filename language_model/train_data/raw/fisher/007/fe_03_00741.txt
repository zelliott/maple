1.23 3.97 B: um hello this is cathy kelly 

4.39 7.36 A: um hi this is barbara cunningham 

7.15 7.95 B: (( cath )) 

8.87 12.30 A: okay um i'll let you begin [laughter] 

12.08 18.98 B: okay i'm sorry but i i didn't actually hear all of the question because the television was too loud i turned it off 

17.32 18.46 A: [laughter] 

18.93 27.82 B: um was it how do you how do you create the differentiation between comedy that's in good taste and comedy that crosses the line was that 

28.12 34.30 A: um i believe it was how do you draw the line between acceptable comedy and 

34.59 36.67 A: or bad [laughter] 

35.84 40.95 B: yeah it was something about acceptable comedy and and something that might be just little over the line 

39.27 40.40 A: yeah 

40.68 42.84 A: yeah 

42.41 43.36 B: um 

43.96 49.36 B: i guess it would part of it would depend on the situation you were in 

49.59 50.64 B: um 

50.68 51.71 B: (( if )) 

52.03 60.69 B: i think you would have to judge by the people around you some if some comedy that might be in bad taste to some people may not be to others 

61.10 66.36 B: so i think that might be be part of what you have to use to judge the difference 

67.18 68.26 B: um 

69.15 72.52 B: i personally think that that that uh 

72.76 80.75 B: comedy that makes fun of ethnic groups or uh religious groups is always in poor taste 

82.07 91.55 A: i do too i i agree one hundred percent with that and also you've got to have um to take into consideration about little children too 

90.98 94.17 B: yes yes definitely children too 

98.86 99.68 A: (( hm )) 

99.65 103.48 B: [laughter] i'm trying to think whether there's any um 

100.16 101.60 A: (( [laughter] )) 

105.09 105.85 B: (( hm )) 

106.74 108.76 B: anything else that 

110.71 113.49 B: i mean personally i i wouldn't 

115.04 125.09 B: i probably like howard stern in the morning that kind of comedy i turn right off that just doesn't appeal to me where i know a lot of men might listen to it [laughter] but 

125.30 130.28 A: actually that's the way i feel too [laughter] yeah 

127.14 140.57 B: yeah [laughter] um i was just trying to think whether you know whether i could think of anything directly other than like i said i listened to his show for about three minutes one day and that was enough for me um 

142.02 153.76 B: i know that i know that men sort of differentiate too you know like between men and women there's gender differentiation you know like women might think some things are way over the line 

153.97 158.29 B: comedy wise where men don't [laughter] so i think that's another thing that 

156.51 157.79 A: yeah 

158.34 160.56 B: sometimes makes a difference 

160.70 161.76 B: um 

163.12 165.97 A: also too with like in mixed company you 

165.85 166.89 B: yes 

166.22 170.21 A: know like uh you know some people might not like 

170.45 175.29 A: the ladies might not like you said like to hear anything like that or what stuff like that 

173.15 174.40 B: right 

174.50 181.56 B: and where the men might be used to telling jokes that you know the bathroom humor is what i call it [laughter] it's like 

177.54 179.07 A: (( yeah )) 

180.66 181.64 A: yeah 

182.30 183.44 B: but 

183.46 184.44 B: um 

185.08 187.04 B: trying to think whether there's 

191.35 200.66 B: i mean i i have a really good sense of humor i mean people have always told me that i laugh at just about anything silly things that aren't even funny to other people just strike me funny 

200.63 207.57 B: but i definitely don't like any any humor that offends people or would make them angry or 

205.14 206.70 A: no i don't neither 

208.14 221.40 B: you know like you said and you have to kinda look at the age group and you know would it affect would it hurt someone's feelings from their religion or the way they look or you know anything like that i think that's when you cross the line that's what you don't want to do 

221.34 223.09 A: yeah 

223.38 225.65 A: (( yeah you don't want to do that 'cause )) 

225.71 234.15 A: you might be with someone and and they might feel different and then i think you need to let them know how you feel 

232.61 236.06 B: yeah i definitely think so too 

236.09 243.43 B: and if you i think if you have offended someone by something you said you should definitely apologize right away and be more careful the next time and 

241.23 242.24 A: yeah 

242.93 244.21 A: yeah 

244.95 246.36 B: (( yeah )) 

246.76 248.03 B: but i guess that's 

248.14 249.22 B: about all 

250.19 253.29 B: all i have to say i guess [laughter] 

251.48 254.66 A: (( [laughter] )) 

254.71 257.16 A: oh gosh i don't know what else to 

257.49 259.76 A: that we could add to that 

259.06 260.73 B: (( yeah um i'm )) 

262.02 265.51 B: just trying to i'm trying to think also whether hm [lipsmack] 

274.75 279.40 B: yeah i really don't know i mean i've been in office situations where you know you've 

279.63 287.79 B: you walked by an area just as someone's telling like a really off color story or joke and you know i kinda just keep walking pretending i didn't hear it but 

287.38 288.56 A: yeah 

288.00 298.06 B: but i know that's another environment you have to be very careful in in offices you know when you're you know you have to make sure you don't kinda cross over the line with things there when other people might be 

298.25 300.03 B: around to hear it but [lipsmack] 

299.42 301.72 A: mhm [lipsmack] yes 

305.27 306.49 B: i guess that's 

308.16 311.21 B: that's really about it [laughter] i don't really 

310.58 312.03 A: [laughter] 

312.15 314.28 B: know of anything else to say 

315.49 319.20 A: i don't know of anything else either 'cause i think you about said it all and 

318.21 320.21 B: okay [laughter] 

319.38 326.15 A: um you know i'm not one really that uh does a lot of talking or anything but i agree with what you say 

326.25 331.77 A: about that and um you know there's a lot of school kids that that do um 

332.19 335.77 A: a lot of off color things you can hear 'em and stuff like that 

333.37 334.58 B: (( right right )) 

334.86 336.33 B: that's right 

337.16 338.25 B: yeah 

338.39 344.29 A: and i hope that i have brought mine up that they don't do that [laughter] [laughter] 

341.46 345.24 B: yeah i hope so too [laughter] with mine [laughter] 

349.15 351.73 B: so yeah i just can't think of anything else 

352.74 353.92 A: (( yeah um )) 

353.96 357.01 A: have you participated in any of these other 

357.18 359.04 A: topics or discussions 

358.34 372.16 B: uh no actually last week i just i was out both times that they tried to call me it was usually i'm here most evenings but it just was a coincidence that we had two events last week and i missed and that was the first 

372.28 374.75 B: week we had i had signed up so 

374.15 375.09 A: uh-huh 

374.93 377.79 B: so this is the first one i have participated in 

378.84 382.96 A: okay do we get i don't know if we had to talk the full ten minutes or 

382.55 386.33 B: oh i i missed that about the ten minutes are you timing or 

386.10 391.51 A: no [laughter] that's what i didn't i didn't know whether 

386.57 388.96 B: oh i wasn't either [laughter] 

389.82 390.86 B: (( oh )) 

391.79 398.32 A: we had to talk the whole time or or they would let us know when to stop or [laughter] 

396.77 400.49 B: okay i thought i mis- i thought you were from 

401.24 402.35 A: no 

401.34 403.34 B: now i understand okay 

403.41 406.19 A: no just uh randomly selected 

405.56 407.07 B: oh okay 

406.75 409.37 A: this is the first time i've talked to anybody 

408.49 414.05 B: yeah me too so i don't know whether someone somewhere is timing us or not 

409.42 410.34 A: [laughter] 

413.89 417.80 A: yeah i think they're recording it to see what you know 

417.35 418.39 B: mhm 

418.43 419.50 B: mhm 

419.58 420.58 B: um 

420.63 425.55 B: well let me think if i can think of any other situations or 

427.29 428.93 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

432.56 434.56 B: (( gee [laughter] [laughter] um )) 

433.94 435.48 A: [laughter] 

441.11 441.78 A: oh 

441.87 444.46 A: if you were okay like you were young 

444.52 448.25 A: and uh young and school ch- school age 

447.65 448.72 B: mhm 

448.59 458.64 A: okay and you were alone on a date or something like that and you were wi- uh with your date and uh you were with a group of other people and they started 

458.52 464.44 A: you know talking and stuff like that about uh and making fun of different people of different race and stuff like that 

464.75 467.11 A: do you think that you would speak up 

469.13 476.56 B: i i i guess it would depend how well i knew the people i definitely wouldn't be laughing along with them 

476.26 477.46 A: mhm 

476.87 477.97 B: um 

479.31 486.02 B: i probably if i could either would just walk away from it i i guess it depended how well i knew 

486.07 491.61 B: the rest of the group if it was a group i knew really well i would probably say something 

487.31 488.20 A: uh-huh 

491.62 492.56 A: yeah 

491.84 500.13 B: if it was a group that i had just met you know or didn't know many if any of them just friends of my date's or whatever 

500.24 506.22 B: i would probably just sort of keep quiet and i guess by my quietness hope they knew i wasn't 

506.76 509.45 B: you know happy about it [laughter] 

508.59 516.16 A: yeah i i think some things like that goes on you know there are some school children that doesn't they're afraid to speak up 

515.74 520.42 B: i think so too that's definitely and i know when i was school aged i was very shy 

516.85 517.84 A: yeah 

519.96 521.91 A: i was too [laughter] 

520.80 526.73 B: so [laughter] probably i probably would have just sort of kept silent unless they were really good friends 

526.52 527.60 A: uh-huh 

526.79 530.88 B: and then i probably would have said well can we talk about something else or 

531.29 533.64 B: you know i don't think it's right 

532.07 533.16 A: yeah 

536.15 539.57 B: but would you probably have done the same thing i guess if 

538.49 550.01 A: uh-huh yeah i was real real shy and you know a lot of them not only that would be joking and carrying on about body parts and stuff like that and you know [laughter] you know and you go uh-oh [laughter] 

547.48 548.80 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

549.15 552.32 B: yes i would have been very embarrassed by that [laughter] 

551.24 553.32 A: yes i would have too 

553.06 554.49 B: yeah 

555.11 556.06 B: um 

556.42 560.19 B: i know sometimes even just you know you're with adult friends 

560.45 572.75 B: and we have one friend in particular although he's a very very nice person you know he'd do anything for anybody will sometimes now he doesn't call people like by racial slur names 

572.31 573.33 A: uh-huh 

572.84 573.82 B: but 

573.84 580.09 B: every once in a while if our group is together he'll tell a joke or something you know and 

580.33 595.00 B: as much as he's a really great person there are a couple of us in the group that just kinda cringe you know it's like and and immediately we change the subject [laughter] but um but i mean he would never call anybody by a 

586.33 587.42 A: uh-huh 

590.52 591.78 A: yeah 

595.31 599.89 B: you know a racial name but sometimes he'll repeat jokes and things
