212.28 220.68 B: yeah but you know what though i always fixed it though especially if like there's a room full of people and i say oh i'm sorry i didn't mean to hurt your feelings 

232.17 234.76 A: if you don't be quiet you're not getting a friendly's star

272.58 273.30 A: ye- 

274.80 283.13 A: yes right exactly but you know it's funny because like i said we're from a bunch of we're a family of (( skutches )) here and we're real 

283.43 284.67 A: i'm like real 

286.97 287.78 B: oh yeah 

290.78 293.42 A: like there are certain ti- like i tease my husband a lot 

293.80 298.82 A: but there are certain things that i would never tease him about because i know he's really sensitive about them 

299.21 302.35 B: right you know where the line is there's such a fine line though 

299.33 300.73 A: you know so i'll bust his 

302.40 303.28 A: yeah 

302.52 313.71 B: with certain people you know you get the prisses and the snobs and you got to just like you know cross your legs and mind your p.'s and q.'s and not crack any of those dirty jokes for the moment 

310.64 311.38 A: right 

312.21 320.75 A: right and then and then i but but you know if someone else does it's like you know ye- you know that they've gone too far it's like you feel kind of embarrassed 

321.24 322.70 B: yeah because of what you said 

321.55 322.00 A: you know 

322.33 322.86 A: like 

330.94 335.06 A: you cringe you know what i mean like like that was just awful 

332.12 332.76 B: yeah 

335.36 336.53 A: you know i i mean 

336.72 343.66 B: or then your friend next to you is sitting there laughing about it and you're just like oh my god you're so dumb 

340.42 345.88 A: yeah and you're just cringing you know like oh my god i wish you know i wi- i'm just mortified 

346.34 348.36 A: but like i said if you know certain people 

349.10 350.19 A: company and you tell 

350.28 356.82 A: you know an off color joke you know and people just look at you yeah that's bad 

352.84 353.87 B: yeah 

364.00 367.01 B: like fix it it's already usually too late you know 

366.48 369.88 A: yeah once it's out there it's pre- yeah it's pretty much out there 

369.96 372.24 B: and it's funny though 

370.96 372.23 A: yeah i e- well i 

372.36 377.47 A: like i said i i mean like i mean even you you di- your dry sense of humor and witty and 

382.64 388.49 B: stress going on today in everybody's life and everybody's (( well i'll say )) if you don't laugh some shit off you're going to end up dying early 

388.51 396.82 A: well that's that's true and you know what i think that people like get away with maybe a little bit more because of that now like where everybody's like a little bit 

397.25 398.59 A: like not so tight 

398.76 401.65 A: about everything or you know becau- 

398.86 399.66 B: yeah 

407.74 414.54 B: and i've where i'm always just trying to lighten the mood you know and sometimes it just doesn't happen cracking jokes you know and 

414.84 416.15 B: and saying something off 

416.29 422.90 B: you know off balance or waiting to try to get them to you know laugh a little bit and it's like wrong place wrong time sorry 

426.97 429.23 A: you know i know her 

429.37 435.04 A: so well and and to excu- 

435.16 435.75 A: olivia 

436.31 438.10 A: she um 

438.39 441.51 A: like uh like some- like i can pretty much say anything to her 

441.36 442.20 B: yeah 

441.81 450.34 A: but every now and then it's like you know you'll be like oh wrong not not the right thing like she's not finding this funny at all so let's just 

450.56 462.12 B: it's like nine and three quarters of the time is a good time and the other quarter when you've just got to push the envelope you just got to try it and it just is like i'm sorry i'm just trying to make you laugh because it worked every other time 

453.17 453.87 A: ye- 

456.45 456.93 A: yeah 

458.19 458.99 A: (( mama )) 

459.94 460.51 A: duh 

466.66 469.77 A: and it became like a big joke and it was li- and it was really stressful 

471.08 474.44 A: you know that was kind of it was kind of good because it lightened it up 

474.98 478.27 A: even though it was like a really bad topic to joke about 

478.26 480.63 B: yeah but you have to sometimes 

478.81 479.42 A: and 

479.73 483.69 A: right i i think that if anybody else was in the room 

483.96 490.30 A: and knew the situation they probably would have been like wha- that was just in the worst taste for her to say that 

490.00 491.90 B: right but it's okay for you 

490.55 494.81 A: but like i know her i thi- you get away with people that you know 

495.10 496.07 B: that is true 

495.51 498.02 A: really well more you know like 

514.26 519.75 B: so high stress and never laughed about anything and i was like you know fuck this i'm going to make somebody laugh today you know and 

520.04 522.63 B: my day went so much easier 

522.26 528.98 A: yeah well because you kind of like you said you have to and it's every now and then you kind of cross the line between good and bad taste 

529.75 531.86 B: and then those people who can't take it 

529.87 533.92 A: then i gue- that's the price you pay i guess 

540.01 541.77 B: stupid of you not to be able to take it and 

542.17 548.89 B: then it's like you know it was just a joke but they should have just laughed it off but (( ack uh )) i don't know because if people crack a joke about me 

549.14 555.12 B: unless it's really serious and i you know then they would know they were going to cross the line before it even came out of their mouth and 

554.64 560.50 A: r- right because they were just cer- like i said i mean that's the same thing with my husband there are jokes that are in really 

560.78 567.60 A: i know what he's really truly sensitive about and i would never ever joke because that would just hurt his feelings 

568.09 570.24 A: you know but every now and then like one of his because he's co-
