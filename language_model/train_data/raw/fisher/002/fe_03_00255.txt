6.48 7.99 B: i'm florida 

7.73 11.52 A: you're in florida okay that's pretty different i'm up in montana 

10.92 13.36 B: mont- oh that must be cold 

12.78 18.26 A: [laughter] well it's um it's about freezing which uh seems pretty warm to um 

18.31 24.02 A: [lipsmack] uh to me at the moment but uh yeah it's uh definitely colder than uh where you are 

23.70 26.13 B: yeah [laughter] right sure 

24.35 27.24 A: uh i was thinking that might have uh 

27.38 39.60 A: you know a bearing on what kind of uh impact um you know uh people have felt from september eleventh you're at least over towards the east coast you're still far away from new york city 

38.82 40.38 B: yeah 

39.74 41.19 A: i don't know um 

40.79 42.56 B: have have you had any 

42.63 48.19 A: well you know we um i mean i don't feel like i've made any changes in my life um 

43.82 44.76 B: (( ill effects )) 

47.37 49.91 B: yeah i haven't either [laughter] 

48.32 51.21 A: really as a result of september eleventh um 

51.42 60.02 A: you know at first it just uh [lipsmack] seemed really far away and we were just kinda drawn to it uh paying attention in the news and so on 

59.60 62.85 B: yeah who would attack montana right 

62.32 75.25 A: yeah [laughter] well um you know there there are so many fewer people in our whole state than you know in new york city or something like that although of course we did notice that in terms of increased airport security and 

62.86 64.31 B: [laughter] 

75.06 75.79 B: (( mum )) 

75.20 79.14 A: things like that and and actually we became aware that um 

79.31 86.42 A: you know i mean obviously there are connections and things happened like um like my company i work at a software company started 

86.47 96.17 A: you know receiving fewer orders and so on and other companies um you know there was the whole downturn in the economy which um was connected with that you know i 

87.12 87.85 B: (( mm )) 

96.20 102.54 A: don't think you could say that september eleventh caused that but it definitely had an economic impact that was felt here 

102.24 103.24 B: right 

102.73 105.56 A: um that must be true there too 

105.78 107.02 B: yeah i 

106.92 114.03 B: i have to say i haven't done anything really differently i was actually quite annoyed with all the all the media stuff 

113.54 114.53 A: uh-huh 

113.92 115.75 B: even even like this 

115.65 121.44 B: this last um september i thought this was re- 'cause i wasn't in the country when it happened and 

118.96 120.35 A: the anniversary so 

120.66 121.76 A: where were you 

121.33 133.89 B: i was in germany i was there for eight months i was studying and stuff so it it really i didn't really know what was going on i didn't pay attention to the news too much [laughter] 'cause everything was in german and my german was so bad so 

122.55 123.48 A: uh-huh 

133.73 140.66 A: yeah weren't people like uh constantly asking you um you know people who knew you were an american there 

139.76 143.97 B: actually i'm not an american [laughter] i'm from finland 

141.33 143.81 A: oh [laughter] may i ask what 

143.88 145.18 A: (( oh okay )) 

144.96 156.24 B: yeah so but i mean the actual people that still 'cause i've lived in america for so long now so people that kind i mean they didn't really ask me 'cause people usually know i i'm not from her originally so 

146.54 147.72 A: so right 

150.44 151.36 A: uh-huh 

156.11 159.04 A: mhm are you a graduate student there in florida or 

158.15 160.16 B: i'm an undergraduate student 

159.47 163.91 A: oh okay um studying something in linguistics related or 

163.69 168.15 B: no actually my mom [laughter] is a linguistics professor and 

166.10 167.48 A: put you on to this oh 

167.57 168.71 A: okay 

168.70 178.94 A: um yeah well that's interesting i mean one thing that i did do um starting from september eleventh i mean i'd actually done this before then but i really started paying attention to how 

178.73 187.50 A: things were reported in the international media not just in the u. s. media and there's so many different perspective you know that you would have um from 

181.87 182.92 B: right 

184.87 185.73 B: yeah 

187.54 189.48 A: reporting in europe than 

189.86 195.16 A: [mn] you know we americans had a [laughter] a big tendency to overdramatize it and 

194.59 197.92 B: yeah i mean nothing's really happened in america like 

198.32 200.62 B: of this dimension 

200.59 201.96 A: no that's 

201.16 202.30 B: and so 

202.03 209.88 A: yeah that's really true although on the other hand there are others things like the fact that you know um 

202.64 204.22 B: it was quite a shock 

210.07 216.74 A: you know ten or twenty times as many people die annually in car accidents or uh you know that sort of thing so 

215.81 216.72 B: mhm 

216.80 220.99 A: um that provides a certain kind of perspective but that's obviously a very different um 

221.10 222.64 A: sort of event 

222.03 223.19 B: yeah 

223.03 226.46 A: um one of the interesting things on this topic that um 

226.52 229.55 A: [lipsmack] that i guess i heard on the radio recently but um 

229.57 244.37 A: somebody was analyzing what was uh said and reported in the media um and what people were saying after september eleventh and just about everybody um sort of drew a lesson 

244.30 249.00 A: from you know the fact that the u. s. had been attacked and uh 

248.99 263.63 A: uh and the nature of attack and and where it uh seemed to have come from you know even before we had um better evidence and and everybody um had their own interpretation and these could be completely different you know even opposite interpretations 

263.89 270.24 A: you know like this proves that uh the islamic world will never be able to um you know to uh sort of 

270.28 283.46 A: uh [cough] get along with um with western countries or whatever and other people would say that uh you know this is proof that um the islamic world is just you know struggling to integrate itself into uh uh 

275.05 275.88 B: mhm 

283.79 287.08 A: you know the international scene or whatever i mean 

287.17 295.37 A: everybody took their own uh view and took september eleventh as proof that they were right [laughter] basically 

294.33 307.96 B: yeah i mean i i have kind of a hard time understanding that this is like a religious um out of religious reasons [mn] people did this i mean i i immediately think that because they don't want western 

308.36 309.55 A: mhm 

308.81 314.53 B: western forces to you know [laughter] take all their stuff to their countries and say here buy this 

314.27 315.32 A: right 

314.73 319.52 B: you know i mean and i can understand that that people don't want this commercialism 

319.24 321.80 A: sure absolutely yeah 

320.96 322.32 B: (( and i i mean )) 

322.71 325.17 B: it's kinda people often 

325.32 331.67 B: wonder why people would attack america but i i think there's pretty much a concrete reason 

331.40 341.28 A: i i find that so easy to believe i mean the in retrospect it's you know the amazing thing is that nothing of this nature happened earlier um [lipsmack] 

340.03 340.94 B: yeah 

341.74 355.75 A: you know and in fact we had had um you might not have been aware not being here but um you know we had some some significant terrorist attacks before the um actually turned out to be by americans there's oklahoma city bombing i don't know if you 

351.07 351.90 B: right 

354.30 356.80 B: right yeah i remember this yeah 

355.75 358.94 A: know about that were you in the u. s. at that time or 

358.32 362.17 B: yeah i was i was quite young though i remember [laughter] not much of it so 

360.58 361.53 A: uh-huh 

361.56 375.43 A: right well i remember um when that first happened um you know like the immediate reaction was this is probably some foreign terrorist um action and of course it turned out to be um as far as we know this 

370.61 371.59 B: yeah 

375.89 376.73 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

376.90 378.04 A: american 

377.95 384.80 B: yeah and also with i i guess well i don't know if this is terrorism or not but with what happened in wacko 

378.46 379.16 A: (( person )) 

384.83 385.78 A: uh-huh 

384.97 387.05 B: and it's kinda religious 

387.12 388.53 B: (( thing i don't know )) 

387.19 388.36 A: right 

388.51 403.37 A: well that's another uh interesting aspect of it i mean i think where religion comes in is not not the sense um you know that it's not a directly religious conflict but people's religion um colors the way they perceive 

399.08 400.06 B: mhm 

403.27 404.13 B: right 

403.35 406.56 A: you know other social or economic um [mn] 

405.74 407.12 B: exactly yeah 

406.60 408.04 A: things and so 

408.06 418.63 A: you know we have um a lot of fundamentalist groups in the u. s. as well that in some ways are you know just as closed minded just as capable of 

412.63 413.88 B: right 

419.85 421.12 A: you know of 

421.20 432.08 A: taking actions you know i don't wanna say that we have groups that would go out and bomb somewhere but but would wholeheartedly support you know military actions that would have similar effects yeah 

429.46 430.72 B: close to that 

431.51 432.51 B: yeah 

432.27 436.29 A: so um so religion does come into it in that sense i mean i don't 

436.48 438.83 B: yeah people get really intense when 

438.92 441.39 B: i guess when religion is taken into it 

441.67 443.75 B: or from when they when they look from 

441.87 443.00 A: yeah 

444.59 447.11 B: from look at things from a religious perspective 

447.24 451.22 A: yeah that sounds like uh that you don't [laughter] 

450.57 455.87 B: [laughter] no i don't really i don't really have too much of any religion so 

452.72 453.69 A: yeah 

455.70 466.52 A: well i guess i'm in a similar situation but uh yeah for some people that's very close to their personal um world view and and view of themselves and so it's all 

460.99 461.87 B: mhm 

464.94 465.96 B: mhm 

466.58 468.14 A: kinda tied up in 

468.63 472.50 B: yeah so you're in um did you say software 

472.45 481.36 A: yeah i am so i'm doing some uh software related to linguistic type processing and so that's how i got connected with this um 

478.03 479.01 B: (( oh )) 

481.46 489.95 A: this study um and i'd be happy to um talk about that a little bit but i guess you're not in that field yourself then 

482.81 483.76 B: yeah 

489.55 491.41 B: mm no [laughter] not really 

490.85 492.53 A: what what are you studying 

492.02 502.18 B: um i'm just i'm actually doing my associates degree right now and i'm planning on transferring to the university of florida and i'm so- um sociology is my major so 

501.38 502.31 A: uh-huh 

502.42 504.32 B: so it's sort of but my 

503.46 505.91 A: so this topic is closer to your 

506.10 506.75 B: (( mm )) 

506.17 507.02 A: um 

506.92 514.39 B: yeah more or less [laughter] um my mom is um she does uh research in bilingualism 

514.24 515.21 A: uh-huh 

514.73 516.34 B: uh she's always kind of 

516.63 522.32 B: i mean well i've alw- i have always been around linguistics most of my life so 

520.66 521.62 A: i see 

521.87 524.53 A: how how much of your life have you lived in the u. s. then 

524.09 527.65 B: i've been here thirteen years i'm twenty 

526.28 527.23 A: uh-huh 

527.56 532.99 A: okay so you must be at least bilingual probably three or four or five 

533.37 538.23 B: yeah i i fully speak english and finnish and i speak some german so 

533.49 534.71 A: languages 

536.79 537.74 A: uh-huh 

538.20 539.10 A: uh-huh 

540.08 544.59 A: was was that a sociology program that you were in germany for 

544.04 556.57 B: no i was actually at this uh shore international university and i was then i was majoring in [laughter] international relations actually but um and i did like a german language course 

551.97 552.91 A: mhm 

556.32 557.83 A: mhm 

557.08 559.79 B: so but i would like to go back there one day and try to 

559.82 561.52 B: learn more german [laughter] 

561.71 565.30 A: well you'll probably have a chance some time actually there's um 

565.20 579.41 A: some of the software i'm working um with or trying to develop uh is something i've um looked into applying in different areas which uh not exactly sociology at this point although um i'm on a mailing list with a lot of other 

569.79 570.35 B: (( mm )) 

579.52 588.41 A: um people who are doing sociology and it's um they're using a technique called content analysis to try and um basically study 

581.55 582.45 B: mhm 

588.51 599.51 A: people's perceptions as as expressed in you know for example the media or in whatever kind of um materials they might have you know typically written materials um 

599.56 611.25 A: uh but eventually it could be speech too you know for uh if you have good enough speech analysis but um basically going through uh massive amounts of text and trying to categorize 

611.45 614.84 A: um uh those texts into um 

614.81 620.86 A: you know in some way that could be related to the the kind of words people use or the kind of um 

620.81 635.78 A: you know presence of certain kind of key words either you know uh emotional words of some kind or relate into certain issues or whatever and so um a lot of people are using techniques like that to try and study um sociology issues and 

635.16 636.33 B: (( mm yeah )) 

636.64 637.83 B: it's i mean i 

638.11 641.45 B: i can see where that would [laughter] have a great impact 

643.49 644.76 A: (( um uh-huh [sigh] so )) 

644.99 651.64 A: what else i suppose we should say a few more words about september eleventh um while we're still being recorded here 

647.09 648.26 B: [laughter] 

649.01 650.14 B: (( mm [laughter] )) 

651.28 658.53 B: i think this is gonna be one of those um things that people will later on ask like what were you doing when you heard about this [laughter] 

656.33 665.25 A: [laughter] [laughter] right are you in an office where you have uh someone else listening to you talk and [laughter] they're wondering what the heck you're talking about 

663.60 666.15 B: (( [laughter] mm so [laughter] mm )) 

667.11 668.12 B: mhm 

667.22 668.01 A: (( right )) 

669.09 669.86 A: huh 

670.89 672.67 A: well i think um 

673.92 676.11 A: [lipsmack] you know it it there's 

676.06 688.94 A: there's been an interesting uh you know sociological phenomenon really in just within the u. s. too i mean i think there's kind of a a backlash of certain people in a in a way in that uh there was so much 

689.11 699.08 A: attention paid um you know immediately after the event and uh and a lot of the results of that have kind of faded um 

699.89 704.34 A: [sigh] you know within the last year i think you know it's still something that's still 

704.52 714.77 A: very much a part of our consciousness but it seems like most people who weren't directly connected you know um you know by living in new york or maybe by having um 

715.10 719.90 A: [lipsmack] you know some uh relative lost or something like that it's pretty much gone
