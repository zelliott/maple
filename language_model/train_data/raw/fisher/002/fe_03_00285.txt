5.31 7.92 A: so we are supposed to talk about airport security 

7.58 8.88 B: yes 

8.07 8.71 A: uh 

8.94 11.73 A: have you been doing much flying in the last year and a half 

11.56 14.11 B: um well i go to college away from home 

13.96 14.62 A: ah 

14.40 17.81 B: so i have to fly to and from school on every break 

17.35 19.97 A: okay so that's been probably at least half a dozen flights uh 

19.77 21.05 B: right right 

20.12 24.38 A: taken yeah i've taken quite a few too last year my girl friend was living in a different city so 

24.21 24.74 B: okay 

24.78 26.11 A: did a lot of flying 

25.95 26.67 B: yeah 

26.44 27.25 A: yeah so uh 

26.86 27.33 B: it's 

27.57 30.84 B: um kind of time consuming the whole 

30.06 31.45 A: yeah it can be 

31.56 32.01 B: so 

32.27 35.22 A: have you had a have you had a lot of um trouble getting through or uh 

34.99 44.15 B: um well this past time i went home for thanksgiving and i came back and the buckles on my birkenstocks set off the metal detector so 

35.74 36.03 A: (( well )) 

42.11 42.59 A: uh 

44.77 48.01 B: um that's the only metal thing on my entire 

47.63 48.33 A: uh right 

48.58 54.80 B: person so it was it was just kind of a hassle i understand you i know why they are doing it but 

54.92 55.66 B: it's 

56.02 57.44 B: it's a hassle 

56.95 57.39 A: yeah 

57.51 63.41 A: i had a similar problem with steel toed boots so i i finally just stopped wearing them entirely when going through uh 

62.40 62.81 B: mhm 

64.08 64.72 A: going on 

64.89 65.49 B: right 

65.51 68.13 A: um airline uh going on flights um 

68.75 79.50 A: i actually most of my flights i've been taking on south west airlines and i'm in i'm in columbus ohio here and they have uh basically uh their own terminal so you have only one airline going through uh 

71.47 72.03 B: oh okay 

73.65 74.04 B: mhm 

76.73 77.06 B: yeah 

79.62 80.12 A: the 

80.92 88.78 A: and in in in similar and other some other cities basically only one airline going into uh one part of the airport with the results that they'll the uh 

88.94 90.88 A: security lines are really very short 

90.72 91.40 B: oh okay 

91.02 99.15 A: um and and all the places where the set up is like that it really hasn't been a significant uh increase in time really 

98.96 99.62 B: right 

99.47 100.03 A: so 

99.87 103.21 B: um i go to school in boston so coming in and out of logan 

101.53 101.92 A: oh 

103.18 103.75 A: mhm 

103.33 106.65 B: is is kind of a hassle because they've they've really tried to 

107.32 108.46 B: increase the um 

108.58 110.40 B: the appearance of security and the 

110.08 111.10 A: yeah 

110.72 111.70 B: so 

112.35 112.92 B: um 

113.29 115.00 B: yeah i don't know if it makes 

115.25 118.21 B: the the actual chance of another terrorist attack less 

118.83 125.44 A: yeah i mean well obviously the the september eleventh attacks last year we're really sort of low tech attacks based on very 

125.93 128.95 A: very simple equipment that they had with them it wasn't anything high tech it was 

128.76 129.29 B: right 

129.13 131.78 A: box cutters or whatever um so it seems like 

130.37 130.75 B: mhm 

131.89 135.84 A: if someone is willing to do that sort of low low tech attack 

136.00 137.58 A: when they are willing to die for it 

137.41 137.82 B: mhm 

137.83 138.18 A: um 

139.00 142.62 A: it seems like they could always find something else to (( bodge )) together to use as a weapon 

142.64 143.24 B: right 

143.24 146.39 A: i mean some how sharpen a ball point pen or something it could become 

146.53 148.22 A: as dangerous as a box cutter 

148.06 148.58 B: right 

152.76 153.28 A: uh-huh 

156.25 162.11 B: you know people don't even think about just because when you are staring at it you you might not be as attentive as 

162.68 166.12 B: as you probably should be on a on moment to moment basis 

165.78 167.13 A: oh yeah i mean there's 

167.96 170.00 A: that definitely seems like it must be the case that 

170.20 172.86 A: humans have a sort of there's only so much 

172.98 175.54 A: tolerance for repetition eventually you have to stop 

175.76 179.66 A: paying attention whether you can't help that that's it's natural 

176.53 177.17 B: right 

179.09 180.02 B: i i 

180.16 187.90 B: also play the bassoon which means taking that back and forth i have to take it on carry on because i don't want it thrown around and 

182.98 183.44 A: oh 

186.94 187.46 A: right 

188.13 190.53 B: sometimes they don't even ask me to open my case 

190.76 192.34 B: you know there's all sorts of 

191.45 193.48 A: but they do they do put it through the machine right the x. ray 

193.14 193.95 B: ri- oh yeah 

193.77 194.61 A: yeah okay 

194.13 200.51 B: but sometimes it's you know and there's all sorts of all that they pick up is all the weird looking metal keys you know 

199.64 200.01 A: right 

200.77 201.30 B: um 

201.59 206.89 B: i'm sure that they don't like get that all the time so they can't like know what that is just by looking through the machine 

206.87 207.99 A: that's true yeah 

208.12 217.91 B: um sometimes they pick it out and they you know look through every thing but other times they definitely just send it through which i don't know how secure that makes me feel on a airline 

213.45 213.85 A: yeah 

217.62 220.59 A: uh it seems if your determined it really would be very easy to somehow 

221.41 225.57 A: hide a weapon or parts of a weapon in any of those in something like a bassoon or 

225.64 226.08 B: yeah 

226.65 228.11 A: so so do you do you have to 

228.54 230.87 A: get another seat for it or does it just work as a carry on 

230.46 233.06 B: uh i just uh put it up in my in the over head bin 

232.58 234.28 A: okay and it's it's small enough to 

234.29 237.31 B: right it's not like a monster 

237.07 240.92 A: i know people who have cellos and things like that and they actually have to pay for an extra seat to 

238.94 239.59 B: yeah 

240.77 241.37 B: yeah 

241.85 242.58 B: but 

242.67 247.37 B: i don't uh airport security it's kind of you know i understand why they are doing it 

247.40 247.75 A: mhm 

247.86 250.25 B: but it's kind of hard for me to 

252.26 252.93 B: you know it's 

253.32 258.19 B: it's something that i appreciate and i'm glad that they do but it's also kind of a pain 

258.03 258.46 A: mhm 

258.67 262.90 B: you know you have to schedule that extra time into going to the airport and 

262.01 263.79 A: yeah you have to hurry up and wait 

264.07 264.39 A: (( )) 

264.71 265.86 B: yeah and 

265.44 266.20 A: (( )) 

266.04 268.94 B: the lines are frustrating and the whole concept that 

269.17 270.70 B: you know i feel like 

270.88 272.05 B: i'm trustworthy 

272.34 273.59 B: and i 

273.95 278.59 B: i hate people questioning that but the same time i understand why they have to and 

278.55 281.16 A: oh i've never really reacted to it that way i mean 

281.74 283.65 A: yeah i guess i i you have to sort of 

283.93 285.99 A: course not take it out on the people themselves 

285.92 287.36 B: whoa oh yeah of course 

286.52 286.84 A: uh-huh 

287.05 287.74 A: and uh 

288.32 291.16 A: yeah i guess i never took it personally like that i just uh 

292.39 293.35 A: uh yeah 

294.35 295.01 A: you just sort of 

295.19 297.96 A: are you irritated with the whole situation often you're so tired and 

298.02 299.50 B: yeah exactly 

298.89 301.42 A: under slept so uh it's just a matter and you 

301.82 302.63 A: might you know 

302.74 304.81 A: you don't want to stand with the wait on your back and 

304.66 305.31 B: right 

305.36 306.09 A: all that stuff 

306.35 307.94 B: it didn't really bother me until this last 

308.13 318.29 B: time when it was set off by the buckles on my birkenstocks i mean i'm i was sweet innocent looking college student and it's setting off by this little little thing 

311.80 312.27 A: yeah 

318.60 320.58 B: and then i had to go through 

319.62 320.91 A: do you have call waiting on or something um 

320.74 323.01 B: yeah i do but i'm ignoring it because 

321.24 321.66 A: okay 

322.18 325.92 A: okay they actually said you are supposed to turn that off when you you do these calls i think in the instructions 

326.07 326.40 A: (( so )) 

326.07 328.17 B: i have no idea how to turn this off 

327.32 329.72 A: i uh you you should be able to 

329.99 331.33 A: dial some prefixes i think 

331.59 335.48 A: yeah well then you can ask your phone company but they said it could invalidate the call i don't know 

332.99 333.57 B: okay 

335.14 336.28 B: oh okay 

336.09 337.25 A: i don't know we'll just keep going 

336.40 339.80 B: i just thought it would invalidate the call if like i excepted it 

339.56 342.34 A: i don't know there's something on it in the literature (( um )) 

341.98 342.84 B: okay 

342.51 344.31 A: but any way i'm sorry where were we 

343.03 343.36 B: um 

344.16 347.64 B: i don't know i lost my train of thought i'm sorry 

347.16 348.70 A: uh 

348.91 353.49 A: you you were oh just that uh you thought it was ridiculous that the birkenstock buckles yeah 

352.24 352.83 B: yeah 

353.18 355.75 B: it's one of those things where then if you have pretty much 

355.88 359.19 B: any metal at all on any part of your body it's going to set them off 

359.36 361.41 A: yeah so a belt buckle would do the same thing 

361.01 361.76 B: right 

361.76 362.67 A: watch or any or that 

362.81 363.24 A: yeah 

362.89 363.41 B: yeah 

363.55 364.23 B: which is 

364.68 367.09 B: i mean a lot of people wear watches 

367.05 367.49 A: yeah 

368.20 368.65 B: so 

369.21 374.49 A: i whenever i had the steel toed boots i mean i got in the habit of just taking them off entirely and putting them right on the belt 

374.32 374.72 B: mhm 

374.70 376.27 A: and just not even trying to get through the 

376.43 376.97 A: the um 

377.47 379.03 A: metal detector with them and 

379.16 384.81 A: some security guards are not familiar with that practice and they were all surprised but it usually seemed to save time 

385.13 387.80 B: yeah well that at least makes sense and 

388.54 390.77 B: oh god so you are obviously like 

390.96 393.56 B: happy and complying with everything then 

392.94 393.93 A: yeah yeah 

394.67 395.28 A: i uh 

395.40 398.87 A: so yeah logan must be a nightmare i haven't been in in uh logan since 

399.24 400.84 A: all this stuff happened 

401.04 408.54 A: but uh you know i do everything i can i fly into massachusetts a lot too my parents live there but i usually try to fly into either manchester or providence 

405.08 405.57 B: okay 

408.78 409.21 B: yeah 

409.28 409.70 A: um 

409.87 411.44 A: the airports there are so much smaller 

411.59 415.62 A: everything is so much easier but i guess if you are in the in boston you don't want to have to take a bus 

415.92 417.71 A: an hour to manchester or something 

417.51 420.97 B: right and i'm from the west coast so flying to boston 

420.84 423.72 A: uh yeah you have to go through a big airport anyway (( at some )) 

423.47 424.45 B: right right 

423.82 424.78 A: right yeah 

425.33 425.79 B: so 

426.03 428.44 B: there's there's always lots of security and 

428.68 429.23 A: yeah 

429.12 430.23 B: it's kind of a pain 

430.99 431.48 B: um 

438.93 439.82 A: uh um right 

440.58 444.03 B: filled to the brim of like christmas presents and 

444.32 447.28 B: you know random clothing items and 

446.61 449.41 A: oh yeah dirty underwear and all that that's exactly and some (( )) 

447.75 448.64 B: exactly 

448.96 451.58 B: -cause um of course i'm planning on doing laundry when i go home 

451.21 452.33 A: of course 

451.70 455.62 B: and so then they can't like put everything back in the bag because i had it 

455.18 455.49 A: yeah 

455.76 461.66 B: like stuffed to the top and it was just a whole like oh yeah that's my underwear 

461.23 469.44 A: i'm sure they are used to it i feel like i had someone have to go through my sneakers once and i felt so bad for the poor person i mean they had gloves and everything but 

462.60 463.12 B: yeah 

469.28 469.84 B: right 

469.91 471.21 A: it is not uh it is kind of uh 

471.56 472.90 A: humiliating job 

473.04 473.39 A: to have 

473.15 478.71 B: right i'm sure they can't like you know can't appreciate the uh 

479.10 483.75 B: the nuances of the the security that when they are like 

483.27 483.76 A: yeah when 

483.87 489.82 B: digging through people's underwear i'm sure like if that was me i'd just be oh i don't want to do this 

489.21 491.84 A: i saw a guy to um r- right in front of me 

491.98 496.07 A: get his hand cut because he was fishing around in um a toiletry kit 

495.90 496.63 B: oh 

496.29 499.97 A: and i guess you are aloud to have safety razors because the person had a safety razor 

499.81 500.16 B: right 

500.19 502.54 A: um but he he sliced his finger on it 

502.38 502.93 B: oh 

502.84 503.71 A: so that was kind of 

503.49 504.56 B: was that in carry on 

504.74 505.88 A: yeah yeah in the carry on 

505.74 506.52 B: huh 

506.40 514.11 A: because uh yeah they definitely can't have straight razors or anything like that but this person had you know a a safety razor you know you know what i mean like a 

513.44 514.16 B: right right 

514.28 516.33 A: uh a disposable one um 

517.19 520.28 B: that's interesting because you wouldn't think they would allow anything 

520.63 521.87 B: that could cut something 

521.41 525.60 A: yeah i mean that's something i really could not see how you could make it in to a weapon 

525.71 529.85 A: you'd have to remove the razor blade and some how fasten it to something else but 

529.36 529.98 B: right 

530.34 533.94 A: but yeah i mean i- it is no more absurd than many of the other things like they don't let 

534.25 537.63 A: at they have at times not let crochet hooks through and things like that 

537.47 538.10 B: really 

537.74 544.36 A: but yeah yeah someone was telling me that that you couldn't bring knitting and crocheting equipment on a plane i don't know what the rules are now but 

551.52 561.09 B: airline pilot and he has a there is a list of things that can't go in the plane so it's it's you know and it's really long and some of them you know it's like pool cues and you think 

552.16 552.52 A: mhm 

555.26 555.63 A: mhm 

561.49 567.07 B: you know okay but at the same time you know i guess it makes sense it's just kind of 

567.39 569.04 A: it's just long is all it is it's not 

569.29 570.84 B: right um 

570.23 571.56 A: but i mean the the support 

571.68 573.14 A: s- the support them 

573.49 575.78 A: (( bars on your uh )) carry on suitcase or 

576.30 577.36 A: not that much shorter 

577.35 578.15 B: right 

578.34 581.44 B: you know i i don't know like how much 

581.60 586.90 B: it makes sense but it's not something you would instantly think about oh i can't bring uh a pool cue on the plane 

586.80 588.06 A: right yeah 

587.53 591.85 B: so it that's another thing that that could be created into a hassle 

591.42 595.90 A: yeah right people get i mean things having to be confiscated at the last moment and all that 

596.02 603.53 B: yeah you would think that in um they would take i know they have taken some measures to try and keep some people away from 

603.69 605.04 B: like the cockpit area 

605.17 605.87 B: (( uh oh )) 

605.38 606.51 A: yeah 

606.25 610.42 B: but you think that would be um more of a focus because 

610.76 612.54 B: as you said you can create 

613.09 615.14 B: a weapon out of things that you can take on 

613.84 614.25 A: yeah 

615.59 619.41 A: right but of course i mean you don't want passengers getting hurt any either and uh 

618.98 619.98 B: right uh 

619.51 624.75 A: and during the attacks last year i believe they started by you know just working in the cabin threatening passengers and 

624.59 625.15 B: really 

625.46 627.69 A: i i i thought i heard about it that way they they've 

628.16 636.02 A: killed a few people and threatened passengers and then s- sort of smoked the pilots out that way saying we will kill a person every minute until you come out of the cockpit 

635.08 636.25 B: oh i didn't know that 

636.17 638.66 A: i i seemed i thought i heard that i could be wrong 

638.49 638.93 B: okay 

639.34 643.31 A: so yeah even if the cockpit is secure it could be 

643.91 644.19 A: um 

644.33 646.47 A: you know they could still murder people 

646.31 646.91 B: that's true 

648.78 651.24 B: yeah but at the same time like 

652.74 653.80 B: clearly the 

654.15 656.79 B: the actual flying of the plane caused 

657.38 658.50 B: the devastation 

658.30 661.32 A: oh yeah yeah clearly no doubt about it but yeah they were 

661.93 664.73 A: got they were able to get into that position by attacking passengers 

664.54 665.51 B: right right 

664.83 666.12 A: and flight attendants i think 

667.64 668.57 B: oh it's just 

668.68 675.99 B: it's one of those things that i i never really wanted to think about you know you never want to be forced to think about your safety on an airplane 

675.81 678.20 A: yeah i still don't really worry um do you get
