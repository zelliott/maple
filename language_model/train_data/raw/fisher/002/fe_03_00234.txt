140.24 142.30 A: they were together a long time but 

142.32 151.69 A: i want someone that i can trust and that's that's a lot like me so because i want someone who is like back and we have our own lives but we have a life together

163.17 165.10 A: i don't either [laughter] 

164.49 178.94 B: i have no idea but i think this well the whole study is like talking about how people like deal in conversation where they don't know so i guess they're kind of trying to study how people like the equivalent of like how people meet each other or how they start conversations or you know like a 

179.06 182.12 B: um i don't know you know i guess it would be like 

182.37 184.61 B: like uh how people um 

185.02 192.49 B: [lipsmack] you know like if a guy is gonna hit on a girl or a girl's gonna hit on a guy they have to start somewhere you know so maybe they're kind of starting that that kinda of yeah 

189.82 191.07 A: that's true 

191.15 198.53 A: and so see i didn't even know what it was about my psychology adviser um [laughter] sent it to me and was like sign up for this and so 

198.93 201.59 A: i thought it would be a good thing and so i 

200.78 203.20 B: you get paid money we get paid money for it so 

202.58 205.21 A: i know that's what i thought was so interesting 

204.98 206.94 B: i know it's like i'll sit here and wait 

206.19 208.41 A: for not doing very much 

208.04 211.26 B: (( yeah i went in with a thousand dollars but we should )) 

208.82 209.78 A: (( [laughter] )) 

210.77 212.91 A: (( oh i know [laughter] i was )) 

211.60 214.79 B: [laughter] 

213.50 216.71 A: i know that's exciting so how did you find out about it 

216.58 219.94 B: um my friends my one of my other graduate student friends sent me an email 

220.54 223.01 A: ah are you a psychology graduate student 

222.36 223.53 B: (( yes yes i am )) 

223.57 227.27 A: oh okay and so yeah i would like to be [laughter] 

226.86 228.06 B: you would like to be 

227.72 230.80 A: i would like to be out if i could find undergraduate work 

230.46 232.54 B: yeah it's pretty great i like it a lot 

232.49 235.08 A: really and where in new york do you live

242.69 244.71 B: you you almost went there for undergraduate 

243.96 246.18 A: yes and so um 

246.31 250.41 A: [mn] i was actually going to major in public relations before i went and so 

250.61 254.44 A: i ended up changing my mind and coming to oklahoma and so 

254.93 257.15 B: and where are you from originally oh 

255.44 256.19 A: (( oh )) 

256.98 261.60 A: i'm from texas and so i'm going to probably go to 

261.61 265.65 A: boston or new york when i graduate next year do you like it there 

265.51 272.03 B: i do i really love it i'm from california and i went to school in northern california i grew up in southern california so i

273.19 275.62 A: i was i really want to move there 

275.98 283.17 A: and so i think it'd be very interesting and so so what are is every time we make a call it's gonna be a different subject 

283.45 284.70 B: it yeah i think so 

284.81 287.47 A: oh okay oh interesting 

285.23 287.18 B: yeah every time every time i talk 

287.46 290.78 B: yeah so if let's see if i can think of anything else for us 

291.02 291.90 A: what else 

292.43 297.55 B: [laughter] i don't want them to get this and be like oh great they just sit there and talk about themselves a little bit or whatever 

296.79 303.12 A: i know [laughter] so are you gonna um are you do you want to be married soon or would you rather be older 

297.87 298.71 B: um 

303.15 317.46 B: oh i mean i wanna be married soon like i would definitely like to have is it i like to have the security of having like that person you know kind of like done and met and accounted for and i could you know i could go for having an extended engagement or something like that but um 

309.63 310.97 A: mhm 

317.52 329.58 B: i really you know like i um i'm i'm set on having a family and a career and um i'm gonna really try and balance them and so of course you know what i would one of the things i would look for in a life partner would be 

329.60 337.68 B: like flexibility to let me do that and like support and everything and uh [sigh] and so but i don't wanna wait too long 

331.40 332.43 A: mhm 

337.72 338.57 B: (( you know )) 

337.76 339.98 A: would you want him to take care of your children 

340.01 342.38 B: oh no no no i'd want us both to take care of 

341.78 343.19 A: you want him both too 

343.21 346.54 B: yeah you know a joint effort and um 

347.48 355.26 B: [lipsmack] and so because i'm als- because an intelligent female i'd have to i would have to what i would look for in a life partner would be someone who is not threatened by that 

355.06 356.26 A: yes 

355.98 361.22 B: and uh you know it's like you get your phd and and you just wait you'll 

361.57 372.78 B: figure it out even more as you rise in the in the intellectual circles you're like you meet guys and just like they're not like they some people they're really nice guys but they just have trouble with really smart gir- you know 

373.41 374.19 B: (( [sigh] so )) 

374.05 382.05 A: right i understand that see i want someone who is intelligent also that doesn't want children because i want us to both have our own careers 

381.86 383.17 B: so you don't wanna have kids 

382.80 384.42 A: i do not no 

384.02 385.71 B: (( oh [laughter] )) 

384.72 391.34 A: and i want someone who doesn't either like maybe when i'm older i might want to adopt one but not 'til i'm old [laughter] 

388.82 389.51 B: mhm 

390.98 392.46 B: why don't you want to have kids 

392.44 401.17 A: i i wanna work and i don't i don't wanna have a nanny fulltime and i really like to travel and [lipsmack] i just felt 

400.17 401.25 B: what if you just 

402.40 406.11 A: i don't see i don't think i'd want them when i was older either [laughter] 

405.64 408.67 B: mm [lipsmack] my parents waited ten years until they had kids 

408.27 409.82 A: oh really 

409.22 411.45 B: (( yeah they were married for ten years before they had kids )) 

411.77 414.56 B: i think that's a good path to take a little bit you know 

414.11 424.13 A: yeah i just don't wanna marry someone who like really wants them because if i don't ever change my mind then i just want to be flexible with the idea if we have 'em we have 'em if we don't then we don't 

423.83 424.53 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

424.46 426.62 A: i don't want it to be a [sigh] 

426.82 441.34 A: a bit thing you know if one of us decides we want to that the other one will be open to the idea but i don't want it to be like oh we're getting married we're having kids you know and that i don't want it to be like that and i want to live in a big city and i wouldn't want to raise kids in a big city so 

440.97 441.90 B: oh really 

441.92 451.86 A: yeah i don't know i live in some really small town and i think i don't know i wanna marry someone from a small town but i want us to live together in a big city 

451.49 452.65 B: (( [laughter] )) 

452.55 457.05 A: [laughter] i'm sor- i just don't want kids and so 

456.40 466.97 B: i was i was raised in a medium sized town and uh yeah and i live i live in a big town right now but i'm not like but i can't like manhattan is like really intense 

459.19 460.29 A: really 

462.26 463.28 A: yeah 

466.83 467.68 A: (( yeah )) 

466.98 475.44 B: and so i actually live in brooklyn and i love like one of the boroughs i love going home very night to like brooklyn for there's like real streets and 

475.37 476.53 A: mhm 

475.42 484.41 B: and like families and all that kinda stuff and so um yeah i could never raise my kids in actual like manhattan but um i really like brooklyn 

484.91 490.17 A: no i li- but i'd just live in an apartment in the middle of manhattan [laughter] 

489.44 491.29 B: oh do you wanna live [laughter] 

490.63 502.00 A: yeah [laughter] and so with no children and with someone who works all the time and will have [mn] work for work things to go to and social things to go to and just no children to worry about 

501.46 502.10 B: (( mm )) 

502.32 504.95 A: and so i just want someone who works a lot 

504.86 506.86 B: [laughter] but has time for you 

506.76 510.15 A: [laughter] yes but has time for me exactly 

510.20 510.85 B: hm 

510.56 512.51 A: (( and so and so )) 

512.68 515.75 A: [mn] yes is there any other questions you have about 

515.84 518.21 B: (( [sigh] um yeah i )) 

516.32 518.71 A: (( it or talk about )) 

518.40 521.46 B: (( don't know i mean i don't really know i mean i want uh )) 

522.03 525.44 B: i guess all the other thi- the other thing i would say is that how people 

525.54 532.31 B: like um [mn] what i would want in a life partner is someone who was like ready and willing to try really hard because 

531.46 532.65 A: mhm 

532.24 535.08 B: like as much as my parents have been together for thirty two years 

534.95 548.75 B: and like everything is great with them you you know that like love is no piece of cake as it is in the movies and that you have to like really work your butt off to make it work and so i'd want someone who was dedicated and willing to like you know [sigh] make sure everything 

547.15 548.55 A: mhm 

548.89 550.48 B: pans out basically 

550.58 554.15 A: mm-mm i want someone who gets along with my friends 

553.70 554.90 B: [laughter] 

555.03 562.07 A: [laughter] that's always really important to me because all my life mm the people i have been with have been friends 

561.69 562.64 B: mhm 

562.07 563.88 A: and i want my 

563.81 570.36 A: husband and my life partner to be a friend you know and have been friends with my friends and 

570.30 580.90 A: because i mean if they should pass away then i still wanna have my friends to fall back on and you know not just my husband like my grandparents like they have no friends they just have each other 

581.01 581.63 B: (( mm )) 

581.22 587.09 A: so like when one of them dies the other one's not gonna have anything to do and i and i don't want it to be like that 

584.36 586.22 B: yeah that 

586.47 596.15 B: that's that's that's close to my parents in some respects but in other respects it's not so but yeah i i definitely want i definitely want my significant other to be my best friend 

590.53 591.80 A: right 

595.99 603.05 A: oh yes me too and so but i just want us to be able to have like a larger social group outside of just the two of us 

602.57 603.69 B: (( that's healthy that's )) 

604.05 605.98 A: yeah and so 

605.48 606.63 B: (( definitely healthy )) 

606.01 612.54 A: i don't know i don't want it to be like my parents though where they never ever saw each other and they both have their own friends and that was it [laughter] 

612.23 613.14 B: really 

612.94 617.31 A: yeah and so i just want it to be in between 

617.65 618.35 B: (( [laughter] )) 

618.46 625.72 B: i have a hard time fathom- like fathoming like what it must have been like because i know so many people that have had their parents' divorce so i'm just like i have no idea 

622.06 622.92 A: (( [cough] )) 

626.02 627.36 A: right 

626.85 630.31 B: i have like a bill cosby kind of like leave it to beaver family 

630.20 633.78 A: (( [laughter] it must be nice [laughter] )) 

630.47 634.83 B: not quite i'm being i'm exaggerating but [laughter] i'm exaggerating 

634.81 636.08 A: [laughter] no 

635.05 636.76 B: (( sometimes it feels like that )) 

637.18 644.41 A: oh that would be nice and so no i don't really want that family and i don't really want the family that i grew up in i just want somewhere in between 

644.88 646.41 A: and so with no children 

645.11 646.29 B: (( that sounds pretty good )) 

646.58 648.36 B: (( [laughter] and with no children )) 

648.51 657.35 B: one of my best friends too she doesn't want to have any kids and she's like and her and her boyfriend that she was with for a really long time really wanted to and so that's one of the reasons they broke up 

655.33 656.62 A: mhm 

657.29 663.33 A: see i i don't think i would date someone seriously that would not want children i mean that did want children 

663.57 667.36 A: because i wouldn't want it to come down to that whether we were going to be together or not 

666.84 680.92 B: yeah my my brother's going through the same thing because he's been with his girlfriend for like oh god ten years over ten years and i think the reason and they like they bought a house together and all that kind so they're committed but i think one of the reasons that they're not actually married is that 

673.86 675.29 A: oh lord 

680.85 684.72 B: he kinda wants to have kids and she's absolutely against it 

684.27 692.60 A: right see i don't want that to come between me and someone i want it to just be an option but if we don't then it's not gonna break us up 

692.30 696.62 B: but well i think he would like it to be an option too but it's not even an option [laughter] so 

695.40 696.56 A: oh it's not 

696.69 703.33 B: right she was like no and i think it's for other reasons like besides like you know like having trouble 

697.53 698.24 A: um 

703.36 718.01 B: um it's not like she had a horrible childhood whereas my friend didn't have the greatest childhood and kind of uh i think that's one of the reasons but annette doesn't want to like disfigure herself [laughter] she wants to like stay beautiful so i'm like oh my 

714.14 715.66 A: yeah 

718.41 719.89 A: (( i used to be in that )) 

718.79 719.41 B: (( god ))
