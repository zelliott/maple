183.22 184.24 A: yeah 

185.28 191.74 B: you have to think of it as sort of the same sampling of people that you might meet randomly 

191.41 192.48 A: mhm 

191.89 193.79 B: sort of out in the world 

193.32 194.80 A: mhm 

194.16 201.70 B: and if you look at it that way then i guess it's not a big deal like if you just don't take it that seriously and kind of 

200.09 201.17 A: mhm 

202.14 212.58 B: [cough] don't have it be the focus of your life you know and just sort of one thing that you do on the side in addition to all the normal things you do anyway i think it's not bad

208.50 211.06 A: mhm right

233.71 235.83 B: i joined it in um 

235.92 237.88 B: like i think may or june 

237.47 238.38 A: uh-huh 

238.42 245.78 B: but there have been like stretches of time where i haven't done it at all for like a month or two because i was too busy doin' other stuff 

245.42 250.87 A: and you you rate what do you rate your interests and what you're looking for and 

250.23 258.84 B: yeah you ra- they basically find out every you know everything about you like your age your height your hair color like 

256.94 257.81 A: uh-huh 

258.94 271.27 B: your religion you know there's this whole list of things you don't have to answer if you don't want to but everybody pretty much does and then you can either post your picture or not i don't have mine up just 'cause i don't like having my picture on the internet 

260.45 261.33 A: mhm 

263.51 264.42 A: (( mhm )) 

264.72 266.10 A: mhm 

267.03 268.19 A: mhm 

270.71 272.51 A: mhm 

271.38 278.35 B: but um and then there's two sections like you write about yourself and then you write about what you're looking for 

277.51 279.04 A: mhm mhm 

278.40 283.01 B: and then once you're in it you can search like the whole database supposedly there's like you know 

283.80 284.56 B: (( like )) 

285.16 292.83 B: two hundred thousand people or you know they're supposed to or maybe more than that like in it it's match it's match dot com 

288.97 291.85 A: mhm wow is it a national or is it 

292.48 296.91 A: match dot com is there a cost to that one uh-huh 

293.37 294.50 B: yeah 

295.45 298.98 B: yeah it's like seventeen dollars a month 

298.46 300.09 A: a month oh 

299.73 300.95 B: yeah 

300.90 301.80 A: (( wow )) 

302.45 307.18 A: is that about right is that about the going rate for those things 

305.61 310.12 B: i don't know it's the only thing i've ever done 

309.15 310.58 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

310.66 311.72 B: so 

311.17 318.11 A: there're all kinds of 'em now every like the boston globe has one there's all kinds of 

313.68 315.04 B: yeah 

317.56 327.03 B: i would recommend match because i think it's the one that most people know about which is good because you'd think that that they would maybe be that many more people on it 

319.20 320.14 A: uh-huh 

326.58 328.03 A: (( mhm )) 

327.90 332.09 B: you know it's not sort of like a self selected bunch of people that 

332.16 334.37 B: you know it's like more popular 

333.93 341.71 A: right and and so it it's a national thing right sort of the database is 

339.86 340.76 B: yeah 

341.20 345.32 B: it's international actually yeah you can search like 

342.64 343.98 A: (( international )) 

345.39 354.86 B: anywhere you're interested in looking like any you can search by like basically any criteria you want like someone's height where they live how old they are 

347.31 348.21 A: uh-huh 

354.87 355.82 A: uh-huh 

354.99 356.18 B: (( pick anything )) 

355.89 357.41 A: oh cool 

358.33 360.10 A: look into that 

359.33 364.18 B: but i i would recommend it but just like sort of take it with a grain of salt you know 

363.79 364.85 A: uh-huh 

365.00 365.88 B: i think 

365.18 367.58 A: yeah yeah 

368.06 371.77 A: yeah it's better than nothing i live in uh in 

372.02 377.73 A: a suburban community where it's kinda hard to meet single people so 

377.46 378.94 B: i can imagine 

378.21 386.08 A: something like that i mean manhattan is it's a great place must be a great place to be single must be a lotta 

385.45 390.92 B: oh i think it's overrated actually i think it's really hard to be single here 

387.70 389.10 A: [laughter] 

390.51 391.47 A: uh-huh 

391.67 396.71 B: everyone always thinks because there are so many people here that it must be great but it's like 

393.87 395.73 A: yeah 

396.84 398.52 B: it's a tough place 

398.20 399.14 A: uh-huh
