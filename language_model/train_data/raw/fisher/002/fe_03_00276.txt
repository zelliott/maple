11.99 15.68 B: oh okay i have friends from that area i'm down in atlanta right now 

15.31 17.52 A: oh really i've got friends in that area too [mn] 

16.12 18.30 B: yeah uh-huh 

18.72 19.79 A: very cool 

20.05 22.11 B: so airport security 

22.52 23.67 B: um 

23.96 25.43 A: (( yep when's the last time you flew )) 

24.23 25.09 B: what do you 

25.91 27.21 B: uh 

27.23 30.39 B: i i have flown a lot probably 

30.59 32.46 B: it's been a couple of months now 

32.73 34.82 A: (( i'm trying to remember the last time i took a plane )) 

35.97 44.20 A: 'cause let's see i haven't done any traveling this past year don't have any no no 'cause i have done some traveling this past year yeah i flew to salt lake city this uh summer 

44.19 45.14 B: okay 

44.71 51.42 A: what else did i fly did i fly to canada i don't remember my my girlfriend's uh canadian so 

51.29 52.21 B: okay 

51.45 54.07 A: she and i are always back and forth and 

53.76 54.77 B: (( oh right )) 

54.64 62.44 A: as far as i can see airport security's are gon- well not so much airport security but customs are really a big pain in the ass may be big pain in the ass 

62.43 63.40 B: yeah 

63.03 64.97 A: and not terribly effective 

66.09 76.30 A: um no um the the thing is that the things they search for i mean still don't really work all that terribly well and i mean 

66.10 67.81 B: [mn] do you think it's not 

76.67 87.76 A: pe- people still bring handguns and things into airports and knives and ah you can still sneak stuff on very easily it's just that people think that stuff is more secure [noise] 

84.19 85.18 B: yeah 

89.34 94.43 B: yeah yeah i just saw on the news last night that the atlanta airport is 

94.62 99.54 B: i think within the next month or so is getting the bomb machines in 

99.66 104.69 B: so everything coming in to the terminal is going to have to be streamed through those so 

104.71 107.42 B: that i guess will catch a little bit more 

107.13 116.27 A: yeah well the question is what are they looking for because i i mean as as dangerous as bombs are i mean when was the last time somebody bombed a plane 

108.11 109.80 B: of what we're looking for 

117.25 119.45 B: well the shoe bomber guy at 

119.19 120.51 A: oh that's true 

119.65 121.69 B: least he didn't bomb it but 

122.18 132.91 A: well yeah let's see they they do seem to be searching for nitrates th- that's one of the things we had to go through for uh going through salt lake city coming back um they they swabbed down um 

129.99 130.86 B: okay 

132.91 140.24 A: all i mean our hands as well as our uh the handles for our suitcases and things like that to check for nitrates yeah 

137.68 138.94 B: really 

139.83 140.83 B: okay 

140.49 144.05 A: which is a prime ingredient uh uh dynamite 

143.77 144.60 B: uh-huh 

144.33 145.29 A: um 

146.15 147.69 B: well that's interesting 

147.49 153.44 A: but the thing is like as far as i can tell i mean you should be able to circumvent all these things if they're smart enough 

153.74 154.57 B: yeah 

154.54 155.77 A: [mn] and uh 

156.50 159.10 A: (( there's a good well i guess having a )) 

158.88 163.36 B: but have you done much international like european air travel 

162.99 169.21 A: um i've only been to europe twice been to china a couple of times but i i mean i i've 

167.12 167.98 B: okay 

168.58 176.85 B: because china is probably about the same thing i think one of the biggest things that has impacted me in going to foreign airports was 

177.49 181.81 B: i i felt like they were much more in control about 

181.82 189.02 B: who was coming and going just the mere fact of seeing soldiers walking around with ak-47 and stuff 

188.24 189.72 A: [laughter] 

188.94 199.36 B: i felt like i didn't want to get out of line for any reason [laughter] and i just kind of i felt like it was a little bit safer and then you come in 

199.29 208.52 B: american airports and you could go all the way to the gates and i don't i felt like we didn't have a whole lot of control 

208.33 209.50 A: (( hm )) 

208.69 210.39 B: over what was going on 

210.27 211.29 A: well 

211.96 222.61 A: [sigh] yes 'cause at hong kong airport has men walking around with automatic rifles and i mean the u._s. i mean the national guard for instance has been a couple i mean let's see i flew to 

222.92 226.02 A: manchester new hampshire and they had uh 

226.32 230.46 A: national guards posted there i've seen national guards posted in columbus 

228.35 229.20 B: uh-huh 

230.49 231.50 A: um 

232.26 234.70 B: are you military though and so 

234.32 235.38 A: oh you are 

234.75 247.40 B: know where you're kind of like [laughter] what who's in the national guard a lot of the time [laughter] and i don't really feel safe in fact i feel less safe knowing they have weapons in their hands [laughter] but 

245.14 246.99 A: [laughter] 

247.34 257.41 B: but i guess i'd rather they had the weapons in their hands than some of the people that i see checking things at the security check points so um it's kind of a toss up there but 

254.07 255.43 A: yeah 

258.46 267.34 B: i don't but what you had said before you know if you're smart enough you can get by um and you can find ways around things and i think that's 

258.49 259.28 A: (( really )) 

267.30 280.86 B: what we're coming up against now is seeing that yes in fact there is a major threat out there um and then how are we going to how are we going to brainstorm what they could possibly do and i think that 

279.71 280.55 A: right 

281.16 283.57 A: interactive instead of reactive 

281.22 282.38 B: that that part 

282.98 283.90 B: yeah 

283.76 286.63 A: like i mean that that was the thing with the the shoe 

286.66 288.16 A: bomber how 

288.62 296.49 A: as soon as the shoe bomber thing happened they started checking everybody's shoes but you know it's probably unlikely that somebody's going to try that particular tactic again 

296.23 297.06 B: yeah 

297.25 306.93 A: but we should check out for it and i mean eventually what's going to happen is i mean we could keep on going on like that and we're going to build up this gigantic bureaucracy of stuff 

306.92 309.66 B: yeah [laughter] 

307.33 309.63 A: and [laughter] i mean 

309.97 316.25 A: then it said it takes three hours for one person to get through the uh airport security and uh 

314.94 316.15 B: (( yeah )) 

316.60 318.74 A: (( uh it's just going to be a nightmare )) 

318.91 321.36 B: but traveling overseas 

321.37 323.30 B: you expected 

323.13 336.46 B: that that kind of wait time was what you were going to come up against and you expected stricter security and all the different xraying of not only carry ons but of suitcases and everything before you checked in 

335.09 335.94 A: right 

336.39 350.29 B: and so i think we've just kind of been spoiled by the lackadaisical system and now the fact that you know that we can't just show up forty five minutes early that it has to be a couple of hours that just traumatizes us 

339.58 340.38 A: right 

350.12 351.05 A: well 

350.19 355.41 B: because it cuts into our mcdonald's drive through mentality that everything should be quick 

353.49 354.31 A: yeah th- 

354.82 363.30 A: yeah exactly no actually um [lipsmack] columbus had i- is still rather quick i mean i i've taken my my girlfriend to the airport and uh 

360.52 361.34 B: (( right )) 

363.41 375.98 A: we got there like you know probably fifteen minutes ahead of time and she just went up got her ticket there's nobody in the security line for the international lane of since she was flying to toronto international lane of uh 

375.27 376.11 B: uh-huh 

376.17 379.42 A: of uh columbus international and uh 

379.53 380.48 A: um 

380.79 384.29 A: she just went to the checkpoint and ended up waiting for like twenty minutes 

384.52 385.42 B: yeah 

385.25 386.44 A: so i mean 

385.58 393.44 B: i guess i have run into that sometimes and it's done a lot better but i remember standing in line [mn] um 

393.61 399.43 B: when was it end of october so just a month after the september eleventh stuff in boston 

399.14 401.04 A: (( [laughter] )) 

399.51 406.73 B: for five and a half hours just in the lobby of the airport waiting to check in at my desk 

406.37 407.86 A: yeah 

407.22 408.52 B: it was crazy 

408.65 415.88 B: and i tried to be smiley and happy but it was really hard [laughter] it was one of times when i'm like so with the gun 

411.59 412.80 A: [laughter] 

416.45 420.18 B: (( just let me sit down [laughter] )) 

418.10 419.27 A: [laughter] 

420.40 434.76 A: yeah no the um see that's interesting people get really stressed out about airports and i don't actually like waiting for trips and things like that it's not a big deal like i've missed my flight before and airlines have put me on the next flight and i was just like cool works for me but um 

432.31 433.09 B: (( right )) 

435.14 444.69 A: there's i mean i'm like really laid back about air travel i've never had a problem really and the worst thing they ever really have to deal with are 

444.94 447.81 A: you know like people that kind of 

448.20 449.13 A: um 

449.38 462.54 A: otherwise i mean people always freak i mean i have a friend who freaks out anytime she goes on a trip she has to have everything planned out and it it it's kind of it's interesting in a way because she um she 

457.92 459.94 B: [laughter] 

462.60 466.82 A: really stresses out if she doesn't know exactly what's going on and everything 

466.86 474.62 A: is like set out perfectly but then like and so like trips with her are always interesting because i'm just kinda like eh whatever 

473.74 481.02 B: [laughter] and you're like my friend from columbus 'cause he and i don't travel well together 

475.06 476.93 A: [laughter] and 

480.57 481.92 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

481.42 496.29 B: [laughter] because i am the anal planner and i would much rather as much as i say oh yeah i'll just get there i would much rather get there two and a half hours early and then just sit somewhere and people watch than be stressed out about being late 

495.90 498.51 A: right right well 

497.03 498.29 B: my dad's [laughter] 

498.41 505.84 B: like you and he's you know i'll show up if i miss it they're gonna put me on another one argh [laughter] 

503.53 505.30 A: [laughter] 

505.53 509.65 A: right that's something i try not to do terribly often [laughter] 

509.48 511.81 B: (( [laughter] )) 

509.66 514.33 A: so being being late for planes is one of those things that that isn't a terribly 

514.59 515.38 A: but it 

515.77 518.83 A: otherwise i mean traveling's not a big thing 

517.23 519.96 B: now are you in school or are you 

518.92 521.72 A: yeah i am yeah i i go to o._c._u. 

520.08 520.92 B: okay 

521.89 522.74 B: okay 

522.83 533.84 B: i'm in grad school down at georgia tech but i find that students traveling too have little different and i am ten years out of college coming back for grad school 

524.95 525.94 A: oh cool 

533.38 534.25 A: uh-huh 

533.72 538.63 B: and uh and students have much different attitudes than adults because we're 

538.59 547.84 B: well i say we as in when i was an undergrad now i'm a little more anal about it but yeah we're like oh yeah bump us off a flight at christmas so we get a free ticket 

547.65 559.17 B: and now i'm like i've got a timeline i've got a rental car i have to get to a wedding rehearsal ra ra ra [laughter] and i find that i'm much less flexible [laughter] 

547.73 548.58 A: yeah 

553.15 554.19 A: [laughter] 

554.44 555.42 A: right 

558.31 566.40 A: yeah but yeah i i i'm trying to be more responsible with uh quite a bit of this stuff and take care of a bunch of junk 

564.08 565.02 B: yeah 

566.51 569.28 A: so i i'm kinda curious what do you do for the military 

569.33 571.27 B: i'm a helicopter pilot [lipsmack] 

570.62 571.82 A: oh really 

571.51 572.30 B: yep 

572.01 577.68 A: that's cool so i mean air security is sort of something directly related to what you do 

572.78 573.47 B: so 

577.51 590.36 B: uh-huh yeah so i'm sensitive to items that come on aircraft and and what's inside of them and and all that kind of stuff i as far as my passengers i mean i'm 

587.14 587.93 A: huh 

590.49 597.51 B: flying passengers with weapons on them [laughter] i'm usually carrying one myself if i'm in that kind of situation so uh [lipsmack] 

593.00 593.90 A: right 

597.13 599.45 A: can i ask what sort of aircraft 

599.29 600.59 B: ah black hawks 

600.21 608.31 A: oh really that's that's really neat hm i i've a friend who's ah ah who just got out of uh airborne school 

601.01 601.90 B: yeah 

603.16 604.10 B: (( yeah )) 

607.97 608.96 B: okay 

608.80 609.65 A: so 

609.41 620.65 B: yeah i never did that i've had some knee problems off and on through the years so i figured i don't wanna tempt it by forcing them into the ground like that we'll just fly the things someone else can jump out 

613.19 614.26 A: ah 

620.36 627.28 A: [laughter] yep which is probably a good good strategy but apparently willing 

624.90 626.07 B: [laughter] 

626.68 629.60 B: it works for me so [laughter] 

629.56 634.95 A: yeah my girl- one of my uh girlfriend's cousins actually is in um canadian air force 

635.09 636.38 B: oh cool 

636.02 638.91 A: but it's all the way up north in one of their bases in one of their 

639.35 642.97 A: [laughter] flies their f. fifteens or whatever they have ah maybe i don't know 

642.14 643.58 B: oh nice 

644.09 647.62 A: yeah apparently they have a very very small uh 

647.81 651.13 A: uh well navy as well as air force [laughter] 

650.51 651.91 B: uh-huh yep 

651.79 656.17 A: my girlfriend actually was in the canadian uh uh armed forces for a little while 

655.75 660.80 B: okay do they have a mandatory conscription kind of thing or okay 

659.14 660.37 A: no they don't 

660.41 665.11 A: they have uh just a a standing army that's why draft dodgers 

665.26 666.41 A: fled up there 

666.25 667.05 B: okay 

666.67 667.90 A: but um 

668.18 670.74 A: yeah so actually she she got 

671.06 678.52 A: after september eleventh which actually sucked 'cause this was on my birthday that um that year she got shipped off to an undisclosed location 

675.81 676.80 B: (( oh )) 

678.48 679.97 B: oh no 

679.36 684.05 A: which i wasn't terribly happy about and like freaking out for about three days after that 

680.79 682.94 B: [laughter] 

684.11 684.96 A: so 

684.97 693.22 A: i don't know this this whole like vaguely relates to uh terrorism and things like that and i i don't the thing that gets me is i 

693.28 704.30 A: mean there's so much stuff with and people concerned about the the airlines and things like that that i mean there's so many other ways to blow things up you don't need a plane [laughter] 

702.65 703.55 B: yeah 

704.33 710.88 A: and it's kind of disturbing in that way and it's interesting to see you know 

710.96 713.58 A: everybody talking about how 

713.62 719.95 A: uh the terrorists were you know taking flying lessons and things like that and actually um
