52.72 56.30 B: well it helped to put us in the christmas mood 

63.11 64.90 A: in my car for just a short 

65.05 67.73 A: they keep the stores overheated 

68.21 80.09 A: you know and so by the time you get outside and you bundled up in your sweaters and everything your just about to have a heat stroke anyway do we actually have to talk about the 

75.62 76.16 B: yeah 

80.47 83.65 A: topic at hand or is that just a way of um 

84.34 87.42 A: sort of greasing the skids and getting people to talk with each other 

87.89 89.41 B: i really don't know 

89.97 91.12 B: i figured we could 

91.26 93.76 B: at least graze the subject if you'd like 

92.71 99.99 A: yeah sure that's fine i- i'm not sure that i have a lot to say about it though if you do why don't you go ahead and start 

100.11 100.93 B: okay well 

101.53 106.42 B: i don't have a lot to say about it but i mean it asked about changes that you've made since that time 

106.51 107.04 A: yeah 

107.37 108.23 B: and i guess 

108.75 112.54 B: i'd say the one big change that i think i've made is probably 

112.80 115.24 B: um not taking family for granted 

115.99 122.21 B: um i've really tried to make more of an effort to talk to family contact them 

122.84 123.57 B: see them more 

124.55 125.13 B: um 

125.43 126.43 B: but other than that 

127.63 132.13 B: i can't really say as far you know as flying i i haven't changed my habits 

132.89 137.40 B: regarding flying you know i still get on an airplane 

136.07 136.61 A: yeah 

138.30 142.09 A: i haven't flown since then but but the part about it that 

142.24 143.15 A: would be more 

144.11 151.58 A: um i would be more aware of would probably be how long it would take to get through security more than it would be fear 

151.92 156.34 A: of being on the plane i have a feeling that were probably safer in the air now than we've ever been 

156.66 158.00 B: i'd have to agree with you 

157.86 158.75 A: probably 

159.11 163.00 B: well here in syracuse it's kind of a small airport 

162.87 168.18 A: oh (( )) atlanta's airport is gigantic i mean i think it's supposed to be just in terms of 

168.84 178.24 A: physical space it's supposed to be the largest the largest airport in the united states i think ohare is the busiest but were supposed to be the largest i think and building on 

175.37 175.74 B: right 

178.49 178.87 A: but

343.41 344.94 B: i loved it 

345.73 353.13 B: i absolutely loved it i loved the kids i think that was probably the hardest part about going back to school was being away from them 

346.60 347.24 A: oh 

351.71 352.78 A: i'll bet 

353.28 356.96 A: well i'm since i'm used to college aged students i i 

357.48 363.54 A: children were just a mystery to me cause i don't have any of my own then i started mentoring a little girl 

363.83 366.37 A: at at local elementary school she was in her 

366.49 370.40 A: i think she was in the third grade at the time we meet 

376.59 382.58 A: spent time with her but as it turns out she wanted to show me of 

380.03 380.82 B: oh i bet 

383.47 384.80 A: and it was 

385.12 396.33 A: a whole world that i was ignorant about i love it so much it was like being in a bright garden where the flowers could jump up and run around or something it was just 

396.60 404.47 A: oh god i loved it so much anyway so i understand what you mean about the joys of being around those little children 

404.86 405.94 A: do you have kids of your own 

406.12 407.30 B: no i don't 

407.62 408.68 B: i have a dog 

408.82 412.07 A: i was gonna say that was going to be my next question i bet you have a pet 

412.15 415.49 A: don't you i hav- i have cats and and 

412.66 414.17 B: how about you 

433.51 433.83 A: two 

434.24 442.05 A: now these are just normal ordinary goldfish who are as big as a clenched fist i mean they are huge really they 

440.07 442.95 B: oh my goodness i didn't know they could get that big 

442.25 445.34 A: i didn't either i i'm i'm just 

445.49 455.36 A: sort of (( )) by this it's interesting to watch them a grow but it makes me feel good cause it makes me feel that i'm doing all the right things and giving them every thing that they need so they are really flourishing 

463.69 465.98 A: i was gonna say i was thinking about it earlier 

466.45 468.51 A: um about the attack an- 

469.36 471.75 A: and i thought i don't think that 

471.95 475.04 A: i have changed any of my habits or 

475.64 479.42 A: i i don't even think it has really taken a big um 

480.06 483.55 A: my my sense of security has taken a big hit 

483.69 484.16 A: it was 

488.23 488.54 B: yeah 

493.21 501.90 A: and they were talking about the first tower having been hit and there was some comment about investigatio- (( )) being an investigation to see um 

508.99 511.50 A: on purpose and as i was thinking that 

509.03 509.97 B: yeah 

511.87 514.89 A: because the film crews had there cameras trained on those towers 

515.42 516.86 A: the other plane hit 

517.33 521.45 A: and wa- i just remember thinking oh my god oh my god my country is under attack 

522.10 522.73 A: it was 

522.84 526.06 A: it was an appalling devastating feeling 

526.93 527.51 B: it was 

527.02 533.03 A: and i don't know why people always feel compelled to ask where were you what were doing when you found out but we do don't we 

532.88 533.58 B: we do 

534.15 535.94 A: what were you doing where were you 

535.92 538.35 B: i was in a classroom 

538.56 539.24 B: full of of 

539.54 540.54 B: first graders 

541.56 542.23 B: um 

542.56 546.53 B: and uh the principal came around and he pulled us out of the classroom 

547.28 551.85 B: um i was in with another teacher so he pulled us out one at a time and he told us 

552.54 554.66 B: briefly that there that um 

554.84 555.65 B: two planes 

555.82 556.36 B: were 

556.51 557.78 B: you know hit the towers 

558.41 559.12 B: um 

559.95 565.33 B: and that they thought it was a terrorist act and we had a block on all the t._v.'s 

566.03 566.55 B: um 

566.71 569.44 B: they requested since it was an elementary school 

569.39 569.96 A: yeah 

569.81 571.04 B: not to say anything 

573.04 573.80 B: um 

574.31 577.78 B: which i thought was silly because i've got to tell you 

578.05 579.85 B: you know these kids yes they were 

580.06 586.65 B: i was with first graders but they knew something was wrong and to not tell them 

583.44 583.92 A: yeah 

586.86 587.35 B: seemed 

587.53 587.96 B: silly 

588.84 589.42 B: um 

594.51 595.73 B: i think so 

597.60 598.17 B: it was 

598.33 599.42 B: it was a hard call 

598.74 604.37 A: did you see a lot of distress in the children in in weeks after that i mean did they seem 

605.55 609.73 A: did they seem to maybe revert to more babyish behavior or anything like that 

609.84 614.45 B: not really you know i think that we desensitize our kids 

611.07 611.91 A: oh 

615.02 616.61 B: cause a lot of them an- 

617.31 619.04 B: a lot of them thought it was a movie 

619.26 621.71 A: oh my gosh that's interesting 

621.61 623.90 B: you know they didn't realize it was real 

624.04 629.83 A: i think you're right about the desensitization i think you're absolutely right because so much that's on television 

624.05 624.67 B: i 

630.41 635.42 B: now how about you i'm i saw it from an elementary school position i'm wondering 

635.74 637.06 B: in like a college 

637.27 637.82 B: setting 

638.71 639.80 B: what was it like 

639.54 641.67 A: you know i'll tell you what was interesting about it 

643.53 645.67 A: in everyone of my classes that meet th- 

645.84 647.34 A: th- the day after 

647.90 650.56 A: we talked about it and in fact i even um 

650.96 653.55 A: encouraged them to write about it i came up with some different 

653.72 656.91 A: ways that they could incorporate it into a writing assignment 

657.91 665.12 A: and they seemed so grateful to talk about it and in everyone of my classes they said that none of their other professors
