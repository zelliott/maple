25.60 32.12 B: um sure in regards to changes that i've made in regards t- after september eleventh 

32.43 36.15 B: i would have to say being a lot more tolerant um 

36.27 36.76 B: of 

37.25 42.01 B: individuals with from different beliefs different backgrounds religions um 

42.48 45.35 B: eh most people probably think that safety is a primary issue 

45.77 47.19 B: um however 

47.65 50.97 B: people being falsely accused of situations um 

51.33 53.07 B: that they have not rendered 

53.17 54.43 B: being cautious of that 

54.90 57.85 A: yeah i i totally agree and i think 

58.60 60.21 A: um even 

60.34 62.62 A: going out of my way to 

62.79 70.06 A: make people feel better i i i noticed after september eleventh people especially people from like 

70.87 75.13 A: uh arab backgrounds or whatever started wearing um 

73.09 73.43 B: mhm 

75.35 86.45 A: like american flag t. shirts or bumper stickers or something like that and you know i felt that possibly they felt very scared for themselves and you know i would 

86.60 96.99 A: it seems funny but i really went out of my way to you know make their i don't know try to show more good will towards people because i figured their lives were hard enough to begin with 

97.19 99.81 B: oh yeah i i i don't yeah i don't find that odd at all 

99.91 101.78 B: that's that's completely true 

101.75 102.23 A: yeah 

102.43 103.01 A: um 

104.26 106.68 A: besides that uh 

108.57 110.14 A: hm i'm trying to think 

111.19 111.75 A: um 

112.01 115.03 B: have you done traveling since then and have you been cautious about traveling 

113.68 117.46 A: yeah i actually went to uh senegal 

117.72 124.92 A: uh i did a semester abroad and that's a that's a country that's ninety percent muslim and um 

118.83 119.29 B: oh 

125.08 130.94 A: that i mean it was very interesting to be there because you know it it 

131.23 142.96 A: that was too much you know everybody would meet me this was in uh january people would meet me oh you're american what do you think about september eleventh and um you know people there were very 

143.32 149.80 A: um you know there were some exceptions but they were like probably more pro american than i was um 

148.37 148.73 B: mhm 

150.09 152.04 A: not that i'm i don't know anyway 

154.66 155.02 B: hello 

157.76 158.07 B: hello 

159.32 160.10 A: here 

161.06 161.41 B: okay 

162.10 163.69 A: anyway um 

170.19 171.69 A: you know they all felt that 

171.98 175.44 A: you know americans would all be targeting muslim people and like 

175.54 183.82 A: they you know wouldn't be able to get a visa which you know may or not may or may not be true and i really 

184.14 186.33 A: had to reassure people about 

186.97 190.25 A: you know that like since september eleventh people have been 

190.76 191.12 A: like 

191.23 199.19 A: approval ratings i guess even though that's a weird word to use approval ratings of islam have gone way up since that time and such in education 

199.96 201.55 A: like people have placed so much importance 

204.71 206.31 A: to try to counter like these 

206.59 211.85 A: you know racists attacks and stuff like that i don't know that was definitely an interesting thing 

208.07 208.38 B: mhm 

213.22 214.79 B: i i know on this end um 

215.69 216.55 B: a lot of 

217.16 217.80 B: the uh 

218.44 223.25 B: i._n._s. the i- i- immigration and naturalization service i know they've been 

223.63 224.98 B: pretty stringent on 

225.38 225.78 B: um 

226.24 226.84 B: foreigners 

226.26 226.97 A: students 

227.03 234.08 B: in the area students and foreigners yeah my brother in law is actually from a different country and just for him to um 

234.37 237.06 B: he was in he was studying he graduated and 

237.65 242.12 B: right around the time he he was graduating was when he when september eleventh occurred 

242.57 243.56 A: mhm 

242.83 246.20 B: which obviously is making it very difficult for him to stay in the country 

245.99 246.53 A: yeah 

246.63 249.74 B: a- it- it's ten times more difficult um 

250.23 255.92 B: and with and with reason i know the government especially they're being a lot more cautious and people in general being 

256.04 256.56 B: definitely 

256.71 257.92 B: uh more cautious because 

259.41 259.89 B: the 

260.31 265.89 B: the potential for and threats for upcoming terrorist attacks obviously haven't gone down still 

266.30 267.80 B: lots of possibilities for that 

268.56 268.96 B: um 

269.56 271.95 B: yeah i i the questions definitely important 

272.43 273.61 B: however 

272.56 273.33 A: yeah 

274.03 276.82 B: however if you th- think look at it from the empathetic point of view 

277.83 279.86 B: uh individuals who 

280.01 283.33 B: haven't (( )) do not have anything to do with any type of terrorist attack are being 

283.72 284.94 B: uh targeted 

285.06 285.62 A: mhm 

285.25 286.50 B: um innocently 

286.62 287.16 B: a- and 

287.35 288.46 B: of course that seems 

288.62 290.09 B: unfair on that side as well 

290.77 292.43 A: yeah i mean 

292.52 296.68 A: just the stories you hear are amazing i mean 

298.87 304.91 A: uh i i was listening to something on the radio the other day uh about 

305.07 305.57 A: these 

306.26 306.67 A: uh 

306.96 307.53 A: you know 

309.21 310.16 A: i don't know 

310.38 317.40 A: i hate to make another generalization but like working class white guys going into a neighborhood that was primarily 

314.34 314.69 B: mhm 

317.68 320.83 A: like people of arab descent and like 

321.00 325.04 A: waving the flag and shouting like u._s._a. u._s._a. and 

325.45 329.48 A: kind of uh like defending the u._s. kind of way and the 

329.77 332.15 A: people on the other side the 

332.36 340.13 A: you know arab descent people all started shouting u._s._a. u._s._a. back at them but like with the entirely different meaning of like you know like 

341.15 349.52 A: this is a country with a whole bunch of different types of people and like all of us support the u._s. and i don't know it was a very interesting story 

349.80 356.59 B: that's uh interesting uh because you bring up a good point about there being a fine line between national pride 

356.92 357.45 A: mhm 

357.58 358.53 B: and um 

359.13 360.52 B: and ethnocentrism 

360.87 363.86 B: which of course ethnocentrism portrays 

361.25 361.96 A: yeah 

364.01 365.89 B: ignorance um 

366.26 372.01 B: in- instead of ac- instead of actually being proud of one's heritage and one's culture and um 

373.04 374.12 B: you know where they belong 

374.60 376.37 B: um wh- wh- where someone 

376.75 377.39 B: comes from 

378.23 379.34 B: it's sort of being 

379.78 380.85 B: close minded 

381.50 384.17 B: in in in a respect n- not knowing that 

385.39 386.12 B: favoring 

386.26 386.93 B: where 

387.70 390.56 B: your culture comes from is not necessarily always 

391.14 395.32 B: a good thing if you're closing your eyes to other possibilities and other cultures as well 

395.59 396.05 A: mhm 

396.44 400.83 A: yeah so i guess i we could say is what we've done since september eleventh is 

401.33 402.94 A: try to battle these 

403.22 404.74 A: negative effects of 

405.36 407.24 A: patriotism or so- i don't know 

407.60 407.98 B: yeah 

408.43 418.90 B: yeah i mean and being being proud that you know we're all americans is fantastic but also being tolerant that (( )) america is definitely the premise of w- of what it's about is um 

419.09 420.94 B: is independence and freedom and not 

421.13 422.05 B: not just the 

424.17 426.29 B: culturally speaking religious as well 

426.89 427.26 B: and 

427.41 428.70 B: things of that nature 

429.81 434.68 B: it sort of since national pride is sort of a a reminder of of who we are also 

435.47 439.11 B: if we're not careful of what we could become which would be a very ignorant country 

440.16 440.86 B: and and and 

441.03 442.55 B: and intolerant of others 

443.90 445.20 A: do you think that that 

446.05 449.02 A: since september eleventh you've gotten any more 

450.46 451.89 A: i mean dis- 

452.04 453.30 A: discussions and even 

453.51 455.80 A: you know fights about this like 

456.04 457.91 A: i mean i have people who obviously like 

456.30 456.66 B: yeah 

458.68 461.08 A: think different things than i do in my life so 

460.71 462.73 B: yeah it's been um it's been 

463.24 466.98 B: being culturally diverse has always been a touchy subject for me because i i 

467.10 467.44 B: i'm 

467.59 469.06 B: i'm first generation american 

469.17 473.58 B: and i i i come from a different type of culture that is 

473.22 473.73 A: mhm 

474.01 475.16 B: is different 

475.36 475.78 B: um 

476.66 477.56 A: what's your background 

477.75 479.95 B: um i'm portuguese brazilian 

480.29 481.85 A: oh wow 

480.46 483.87 B: and and the way that we we were brought up was very 

484.85 485.73 B: w- was very 

485.91 487.80 B: ethnic um 

486.92 487.45 A: mhm 

488.69 493.23 B: as i was growing just being brought up in a in a very portuguese dominating society 

495.27 498.59 B: and then growing up i sort of just embraced all of 

498.81 506.06 B: i started to learn about other religions and other ways of life and others and other cultures and i just embraced it all and that 

506.55 512.52 B: if i had not come from a different culture i am not sure i would have been as tolerant of others and now i am at the point 

513.09 513.83 B: where 

514.54 519.68 B: thi- this diversity is is is really the essence of it all um so 

518.49 518.87 A: mhm 

519.93 521.35 B: y- yeah i i- 

523.93 524.97 B: i i think it it 

525.84 529.64 B: after september eleventh it it just sort of re-confirmed the fact that 

530.05 532.48 B: the tolerance of diversity is 

533.36 533.84 B: pivotal
