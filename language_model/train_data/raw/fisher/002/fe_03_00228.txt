1.50 3.98 B: hi my name is judy [laughter] 

3.27 5.86 A: hi [laughter] uh 

5.91 9.26 A: so what is the most important thing about finding a life partner 

10.02 11.19 A: um 

10.60 13.34 B: that's a hard one isn't it [laughter] 

13.16 15.42 A: [laughter] some things are obvious uh 

17.15 21.21 A: i guess good with kids good with uh good at communicating and 

20.62 22.65 B: right good at communication 

22.75 25.91 A: mhm yeah um 

22.82 24.30 B: understanding [laughter] 

26.19 27.95 A: [laughter] 

28.09 29.42 A: (( uh let's see )) 

30.34 35.79 B: [sigh] okay there's gotta be a lot of it [laughter] 'cause this is a pretty broad topic 

32.67 33.62 A: yeah 

35.31 40.16 A: i guess i guess uh faithful or at least willing to sort of 

40.48 42.62 A: come to an agreement and stick with it 

41.71 46.42 B: right i would imagine having a sense of humor being fun 

46.10 46.96 A: (( yes )) 

46.80 49.16 B: if you enjoy being around the person 

49.19 51.13 A: and and interesting i guess 

50.79 55.68 B: and interesting right although interesting i guess interesting is different to different people right 

55.46 56.85 A: of course yeah 

56.26 57.74 B: yeah 

57.11 58.67 A: yeah 

58.84 60.17 A: huh [laughter] 

60.63 62.30 B: (( [laughter] okay )) 

62.17 63.16 A: let's see 

63.47 64.50 A: um 

63.54 69.68 B: i guess um how how important do you think it is to have common interests or 

69.76 71.67 B: (( common i don't know )) 

72.09 73.69 B: common factors 

74.12 78.74 B: like religion or or interests political interests 

74.30 75.24 A: (( um )) 

78.73 84.28 A: yeah i don't know i mean i i would say that it's pretty important but i've seen some uh some funny couples i guess 

84.57 86.57 A: that seem to have pretty opposite 

86.84 92.70 A: uh i mean i don't know how well that [laughter] what that always works or not but i mean i've seen people with 

92.96 96.63 A: very different religions and different political views so 

94.74 95.83 B: mhm 

96.60 100.30 B: but in that case you said it would be important to be very tolerant 

100.15 104.82 A: yeah i mean yeah [laughter] wouldn't want to be with somebody who's uh 

101.60 102.50 B: [laughter] 

104.85 105.61 B: uh 

105.62 107.49 B: [laughter] 

106.40 109.09 A: always imaging that you're going out or something like that 

107.55 111.98 B: that's true [laughter] yeah 

112.28 114.12 A: (( [laughter] uh let's see )) 

117.17 122.88 B: i'm trying to think what else i know this is this is [laughter] a little difficult 

117.70 119.10 A: (( [lipsmack] hm you said )) 

120.97 123.81 A: [laughter] this feels like a brainstorming session 

124.32 125.62 A: (( ah well )) 

125.65 127.55 A: um hm 

130.21 131.16 A: (( [lipsmack] [sigh] i don't know )) 

132.87 134.15 A: poss- i mean 

132.97 135.74 B: how how important do you think age would be 

136.23 138.58 A: um like being a similar age 

137.99 138.98 B: uh-huh 

138.82 142.85 A: uh it's probably pretty important although again probably exceptions as well 

142.76 143.75 B: right 

143.89 144.88 A: um 

146.90 150.07 A: i mean for some people money is very important also but i don't 

150.47 152.76 A: (( i don't necessarily think that's the most important thing )) 

152.57 163.99 B: well i think it's very hard i mean it'd be hard for for me to say what's important be- i mean what's important to me but it depends so much a- and my ideas change all the time 

160.02 161.12 A: yeah 

163.72 164.68 A: yeah 

165.08 167.61 A: i- yeah this is this is true also 

167.95 168.81 A: um 

168.17 172.62 B: um i and it depends ability [laughter] sometimes it depends on my mood 

172.34 176.27 A: [laughter] yeah yeah or uh 

173.23 173.91 B: (( i )) 

176.95 181.70 B: so it it just changes um [lipsmack] i'm widowed so 

181.87 192.47 B: and i and i'm i mean i have friends [laughter] but i don't have a life partner right now i've been with him for a while but so it so i think that what was important to me at one point 

186.98 187.85 A: yeah 

192.58 194.84 B: is not so important now 

195.16 200.40 B: depends on how lonely i am [laughter] in terms of what i would be willing to accept 

196.85 198.15 A: yeah yeah 

199.74 203.02 A: mhm yeah i mean this is true also 

203.30 205.36 A: or what people are looking for are different 

205.05 208.67 B: mhm yeah 

205.68 206.63 A: (( ways )) 

209.27 210.65 A: (( [sigh] [laughter] yeah since )) 

210.72 214.85 A: yeah i'm i'm sort of on and off dating i was just 

214.93 216.83 B: yeah 

215.16 219.07 A: it depends who i've just broken up with basically [laughter] 

217.62 220.01 B: (( [laughter] )) 

219.98 220.93 A: uh 

220.62 225.71 B: then you're probably more familiar with what you don't want [laughter] yeah [laughter] 

223.55 226.34 A: yeah [laughter] 

226.62 228.44 A: easier question to answer 

228.76 229.52 A: (( mm )) 

228.77 234.41 B: yeah yeah i'm trying to think what else i guess geographical prox- well 

234.51 236.86 A: [mn] then again there are exceptions but 

234.92 237.72 B: we meet somebody i'm sorry 

237.52 243.32 A: yeah it's meeting somebody or i mean i think it's hard to maintain some things in a long period of time over 

243.23 245.17 B: yeah 

244.13 246.37 A: (( i mean for a while i can work i think )) 

246.32 248.88 B: [sigh] or people do that too [laughter] 

248.41 250.91 A: it's true there are exceptions to every rule i guess 

250.17 261.62 B: there are and there're some people who even i i mean i've heard people on television or whatever who've said that that they should beat the longevity of the relationship to [laughter] whether or not they're together 

260.25 262.06 A: [laughter] 

262.65 269.60 A: yeah i can i can buy that [laughter] yeah i ca- [laughter] yeah 

264.36 266.14 B: oh okay [laughter] 

269.66 275.11 A: no i mean i guess everybody has a different different set of things that they want from a relationship so 

274.62 275.55 B: (( mm )) 

277.17 280.35 A: and of course some people don't even want a life partnership at all so 

279.99 281.05 B: right 

281.31 282.28 A: (( one if )) 

282.69 285.01 B: and it's interesting that they're using that term 

285.12 288.87 A: yeah i mean i guess they're trying to be as inclusive as possible 

288.28 289.40 B: right 

290.42 292.35 B: [lipsmack] yeah it's interesting 

294.02 300.46 A: with them [laughter] there's something else somebody who's of the same sexual orientation as you are is [laughter] 

297.79 303.32 B: [laughter] right okay that's [laughter] that would be important wouldn't it 

301.20 303.17 A: [laughter] 

303.92 305.54 B: (( [laughter] )) 

306.21 308.36 B: i guess have the same goals 

309.17 312.94 B: although you can change your goals yo- and goals change 

313.20 316.77 A: yeah i mean i guess flexibility is also important i guess 

315.96 322.53 B: yeah yeah i think that's very important if you were to rank them how would you rank them 

319.86 320.79 A: yeah 

322.58 323.95 A: (( how would i rank them )) 

323.45 324.86 B: yeah 

324.38 325.69 A: i guess sort of impor- 

326.37 330.14 A: communication is pretty important and i guess flexibility as well because i 

329.32 330.11 B: mm 

330.64 331.91 A: think that 

332.22 336.40 A: like we were saying people change in what they want and need over time so 

336.79 342.30 A: you just have to be able to the things and i mean lots of different things happen to people so 

341.51 342.43 B: right 

343.67 344.25 A: (( yeah )) 

343.68 349.63 B: yeah but you're i think you're right in terms of negotiation and openness 

349.23 350.11 A: yeah 

349.83 354.87 B: being able to listen to somebody else hear other people's ideas that's tolerance too 

354.88 358.13 A: yeah i mean it's yeah it's really i guess important too 

357.65 359.23 B: yeah 

360.15 361.65 A: (( uh [laughter] )) 

362.07 362.72 B: (( i )) 

363.02 363.59 B: (( know )) 

364.28 365.78 A: just trying to uh 

367.85 368.64 A: (( uh )) 

370.19 371.21 A: (( yeah i don't know i )) 

371.91 373.18 B: (( trying to think )) 

372.36 375.44 A: guess this would be easier if you know one of us had very like 

376.70 378.63 A: [sigh] there must be a you know 

378.77 382.90 A: there must be at least a multimillionaire to be suitable and then we could argue about it 

383.03 388.02 B: yeah [laughter] yeah it's much more interesting [laughter] 

383.66 386.57 A: [laughter] [laughter] 

389.56 393.32 B: yeah um [lipsmack] try to think what else 

394.18 395.12 A: (( i don't know )) 

396.17 402.01 B: oh was it and this sounds strange but i know somebody who met someone and they didn't speak the language [laughter] 

401.91 408.06 A: that was actually the situation with my parents when they first met [laughter] yeah but um they kind of learnt a little bit 

404.47 407.18 B: (( was it [laughter] )) 

407.39 409.08 B: but they worked it out huh 

408.87 410.34 A: yeah 

410.63 416.18 B: but th- [laughter] but that could end up being i mean that could end up being an impediment 

411.67 413.73 A: (( [laughter] )) 

415.34 418.74 A: yeah definitely [laughter] 

417.65 419.50 B: especially if you don't wanna work on that 

419.78 420.83 A: yeah 

420.24 423.65 B: and also if it's culturally an impediment if again 

423.48 426.50 A: yeah and i mean there are all kinds of cultural i mean 

425.77 426.59 B: right 

426.95 432.42 A: maybe the religious thing sometimes more is a problem as not between the two people who are in love but uh 

432.73 436.16 A: the social and cultural expectations of the people around them so 

436.00 437.42 B: right 

437.20 440.57 A: things can be difficult but of course i'm 

439.27 440.04 B: mm 

440.62 442.89 A: sure we all know people who [laughter] 

443.17 444.70 A: have dealt with that stuff 

444.46 446.45 B: mhm 

446.60 447.56 A: um 

448.36 449.13 A: (( hm [lipsmack] yeah i )) 

455.46 457.91 B: (( [sigh] i'm trying to think what else [laughter] )) 

458.04 459.60 A: guess people who are 

460.28 465.93 A: sort of together and you know not drug out addicts or alcoholics or things like that 

464.12 465.20 B: right 

465.46 467.34 B: yeah 

467.90 471.53 A: yeah again [laughter] i have a clear idea of things i don't want in 

471.70 476.06 B: [laughter] okay 

471.75 473.91 A: (( a [laughter] )) 

475.45 476.48 A: uh 

476.76 478.03 A: (( well [lipsmack] )) 

478.76 479.63 A: huh 

480.79 483.81 B: it's in i i find that that um 

483.84 488.76 B: [lipsmack] having the same political belief i find that to be a real obstacle if you don't 

489.90 491.58 A: [sigh] yeah i 

492.55 499.15 A: i mean i've never been with somebody that has had very radically different bel- i mean slightly different but not very 

498.91 499.79 B: (( mm )) 

499.38 507.24 A: but i guess i guess that that's true but i have sometimes have har- i can i can talk to people of different political beliefs but it kind of gets of my nerves of time so 

506.62 508.41 B: right right 

507.66 509.11 A: yeah i guess that [sigh] 

510.93 515.72 B: no i just recently met somebody who is much more conservative than i am 

515.36 516.51 A: yeah 

515.93 518.02 B: and i find that really 

518.55 524.16 B: difficult because um he expresses himself in ways that i'm not comfortable 

524.17 525.29 A: yeah 

525.51 526.36 A: yeah 

526.53 537.61 B: and and just in general i mean about people about life [laughter] not everything but it it's really um strange to relate to that i found it hard to relate to it 

531.28 532.61 A: (( yeah that's kinda )) 

536.23 537.00 A: yeah 

539.32 543.62 A: yeah yeah i would find that and and i guess that goes back to the sort of 

544.27 545.70 A: tolerance thing as 

545.76 546.54 A: (( well )) 

546.36 547.26 B: mm 

548.80 551.51 B: [lipsmack] right and it depends on how important it is i mean [sigh] 

551.27 552.14 A: yeah 

554.44 560.92 B: i mean these are political times so i guess it's these times feel very political [laughter] 

557.27 559.85 A: yeah exactly [laughter] 

561.34 564.78 A: if you could spend your life with somebody who's but you just have to 

564.99 567.86 A: spend some time apart during the election season or whatever 

567.58 569.47 B: yeah 

568.78 570.06 A: [laughter] 

571.71 572.96 A: yeah um 

574.63 577.31 A: (( that reminded me of something but i can't remember what it was huh )) 

576.79 577.73 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

583.97 590.44 A: gotta have somebody i mean this is this is just me this isn't in general but you gotta have somebody who uh likes cats because otherwise 

590.58 592.22 A: i come with a cat so 

591.60 600.49 B: oh [laughter] i have a friend who's going through that that's why i'm laughing he he's just met somebody and he he doesn't like her cat and she's feeling very 

595.30 596.99 A: [laughter] 

599.05 601.74 A: oh no [laughter] 

600.39 608.63 B: upset by [laughter] she really is no seriously she is i mean uh he if she had to make a decision between her cat and him 

602.90 603.81 A: yeah 

609.28 612.53 B: she might choose the cat right [laughter] 

611.11 616.24 A: yeah i mean it's it's tough not and especially when you've just met somebody too it's kind of like i'm 

617.15 622.05 A: not sure i've been with the cat for you know ten years and hm [laughter] 

620.57 621.23 B: (( you )) 

621.43 624.91 B: can count on a cat [laughter] 

625.12 626.35 B: that's true 

626.50 632.77 B: so i guess you have to have those types of interest too and it's it's helpful to have those types of interests 

632.22 633.59 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

634.16 635.97 A: and i guess some people are just i 

636.41 641.27 A: mean i find some people are just in general easy going and some people are in general more 

640.97 641.88 B: mm 

641.55 645.93 A: uptight they like to have things a particular way a particular you know 

645.62 646.24 B: (( mm )) 

646.16 648.88 A: everything in a i think it's easier to be with somebody who's 

649.78 651.37 A: again flexibility 

652.82 655.71 B: yeah but it i think that's when 

656.03 659.14 B: if somebody's more like if you're like each other 

658.81 659.66 A: yeah 

659.31 662.99 B: it's easier uh oh it's easier to understand each other 

662.32 667.80 A: yeah and easier to be flexible but i mean everybody's flexible within a certain range so [sigh] 

664.04 665.44 B: right 

668.08 669.74 A: it's just that you're closer to the 

674.13 677.14 B: yeah but then then again it 

677.60 679.66 B: could also have uh 

679.72 687.61 B: [lipsmack] if you have something negative that you have in common my my husband was really messy and i'm really messy and that was a great thing to have in common 

685.86 688.88 A: (( [sigh] hm [laughter] yeah )) 

688.16 697.17 B: [laughter] so we had a very messy house [laughter] we were real comfortable with it [laughter] other people weren't [sigh] 

690.17 692.08 A: [laughter] 

694.47 695.50 A: [laughter] 

696.32 697.17 A: yeah 

699.23 701.32 A: [laughter] yeah i guess that's true as well 

703.29 704.43 A: yeah 

703.73 705.57 B: yeah 

704.65 709.07 A: again i mean it it seems so individual what what each person needs or or 

710.16 712.45 A: wants it's hard to make 

711.07 712.70 B: yeah 

714.94 719.90 B: yeah what what [lipsmack] again in terms of priority what are you willing to give
