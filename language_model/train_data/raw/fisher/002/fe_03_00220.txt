42.36 44.75 B: and ability to entertain each other and 

45.04 46.06 B: and so on 

46.41 48.74 B: and i guess it's ah it's hard to know all that 

48.91 52.19 B: when you are eighteen nineteen twenty but it's clear now that i'm older 

52.33 53.85 B: (( that is )) just how important all those things are 

54.29 54.77 A: yeah 

55.86 56.30 A: um 

56.43 59.04 A: well i'm a college student too and i'm twenty 

59.35 60.49 A: but like i know 

60.65 65.55 A: what i want out of like a relationship i know that it's important to me the very first thing is religion 

65.86 70.34 A: if someone that i married doesn't have the same religion as me it's going to be so hard like especially if we have kids 

70.50 73.53 B: y- yeah so that that's interesting that that you would say that 

73.86 74.52 B: um because 

74.71 77.46 B: uh m- my wife and i o- originally 

77.58 78.88 B: ah were not the same religion 

79.28 83.95 B: and uh she converted to the same religion as as i did and i didn't think that would 

94.12 97.44 B: i've a thirteen year old and a ten year old our our kids are older now 

97.56 99.12 B: ah it has proven to be very important 

99.32 102.49 B: um and it was a it was a good move to i think early on 

102.73 103.39 B: address that 

103.79 107.56 B: and and not have that not have that just be something that we swept under the rug until later 

107.76 109.95 A: yeah uh if you don't mind my asking what religion are you 

109.93 110.43 B: jewish 

110.67 111.23 A: jewish 

111.12 111.52 B: yeah 

111.41 111.71 A: wow 

111.98 112.81 B: yeah what are you 

113.03 114.21 A: i'm uh baptist 

114.17 114.65 B: ok 

114.79 118.43 B: and and so what do you define as as far as religion w- what 

118.89 120.09 B: does somebody need to be baptist 

120.20 125.50 B: for you for you to marry them or is it kind of a protestant kind of kind of conventional protestant 

125.74 127.74 B: christianity would that be sufficient or how do you 

127.31 130.50 A: yeah something along the lines of the protestant like not um 

130.70 138.78 A: i mean they don't necessarily need to be baptist but something along that lines that is similar to the baptist because if you get something that's too different then it will still be very difficult even though they are 

138.95 139.84 A: you're both protestant 

140.05 147.23 B: right that ah that's interesting that's interesting so th- th- has so another i'd have then is have you found um have people in your family 

147.53 154.22 B: kind of share the same view as you do and or have you have there been sort of intermarriages in your in your extended family and how has that worked out 

154.43 158.88 A: oh i know when my parents were married my father was church of christ and my mom has been raised baptist 

159.06 159.44 B: uh-huh 

159.19 165.58 A: but um i don't think that was a a really big issue but my family seems to share about the same thing like marrying within like the religion 

165.86 166.33 B: yeah 

166.49 170.58 B: yeah well i agree with you i i think it is important because i see a lot of kids 

170.68 171.99 B: that kind of grow up either with 

172.15 173.65 B: no religion or grow up with 

174.13 175.45 B: two religions that are 

175.69 181.29 B: incompatible i mean you know that that have different values that that can't quite be reconciled 

181.50 185.18 B: and and i think that's um that's more difficult i think y- 

185.29 186.07 B: i i think 

186.22 191.59 B: religion is only one thing but i think it is a difficult thing i think it makes just makes it more difficult if um 

192.10 193.11 B: if um 

193.26 194.69 B: people aren't aligned that way 

195.08 195.45 B: yeah 

195.86 197.00 B: so what else do you think is important 

197.38 200.53 A: um i want someone that has a sense of humor that can make me laugh 

199.62 200.02 B: yeah 

200.87 201.29 B: yeah 

201.40 202.49 A: ah let's see 

203.43 204.79 A: someone that's intelligent 

205.70 206.25 A: uh 

206.54 209.13 A: or fairly intelligent i mean they're not going to be like a genius but 

209.77 210.84 A: ah some- i like 

211.32 214.61 A: athletic people because i was an athlete in high school 

212.22 212.53 B: yeah 

214.65 215.03 B: uh-huh 

214.98 217.53 A: and just it's just you know something to stay healthy what not 

218.08 224.67 A: ah and someone that's content with staying home as well as like going out like we don't have to go out all the time to do stuff like that we could just be happy 

225.09 227.63 A: staying in and reading a book or watching a movie or something like that 

227.72 232.32 B: do you think it's important to share uh the same idea and maybe you would with respect to re- 

232.44 241.72 B: to religion but um to share the same goals with respect to family like wanting to have a family you know like some people don't want to do that you know some people s- some people uh uh 

238.01 238.55 A: yes 

242.25 246.66 B: you know don't don't want to be tied down that way but th- i would think that would be pretty important to you 

246.90 250.25 A: yeah i want someone that's g- i mean because i want to have kids so i want my husband 

250.46 252.23 A: or potential husband to share the same thing 

252.45 252.92 B: right 

253.08 253.45 B: right 

253.93 256.13 B: so have you uh so you say you're you're 

256.26 258.83 B: twe- so you must be like a junior or something in in 

258.54 259.37 A: i'm a sophomore 

259.22 259.77 B: sophomore 

259.87 267.18 B: so so how is your (( )) i would hate to call it a search but how how how how has that been going so far have you have found people that l- 

267.34 271.70 B: look like good matches or what are you what are you even thinking about that as a sophomore in college 

271.53 280.69 A: well i'm not i mean it's always in my mind like looking at people but like right now i really want to focus on getting through school because i could never picture myself being married before i get my degree 

277.14 277.56 B: yeah 

278.02 278.28 B: yeah 

280.75 281.21 B: right 

281.31 282.37 A: because i'm always i mean 

281.42 281.75 B: right 

282.62 290.79 A: i'm kind of pessimistic in a way but i'm always looking at like worst case scenarios like if something were to happen to my husband like i want to be able to be able to provide for myself 

290.69 291.10 B: yeah 

291.21 292.79 A: if i couldn't have someone with me 

292.89 296.01 B: yeah well i think that makes good sense also i me- y- yeah that 

296.22 301.64 B: that makes make- that makes great sense it's hard to know as i think back to college which was a long time ago for me 

301.90 302.49 B: um 

303.07 305.55 B: i would like to say that i was thinking about all these things but 

305.67 309.02 B: but really i was thinking about some of them like i was looking for somebody 

309.14 309.81 B: um 

309.99 315.57 B: who i thought would be good with children and who like and would like to have children because i knew i would like that but also there is just 

316.07 317.67 B: there is just an element of um 

318.29 320.83 B: of uh the kind of physical attraction 

320.99 322.26 B: and and 

322.41 323.73 B: and other stuff that just 

324.15 326.40 B: comes that just plays a a big role 

326.51 337.28 B: that logically maybe shouldn't but that emotionally and and in reality does and that that's um that's tricky and i think maybe sometimes that has too much of a role and maybe that's why so many people get divorced 

337.40 338.06 B: and i don't know 

337.61 339.42 A: i think (( )) people that just 

339.85 342.07 A: jump into a relationship and don't base it on like 

342.42 344.43 A: things that they both mutually agree on 

344.35 344.82 B: yeah 

345.60 347.49 A: and i'm just very worried that i'm not going to 

347.65 351.31 A: that i'm going to end up settling so i'm trying to be very meticulous and picky about it 

350.69 351.97 B: that's good 

352.09 357.88 B: that's good i'm uh i'm now finding we're we're kind of at the age now where p- 

358.11 362.07 B: friends of ours are starting to get divorced actually uh people people that we knew for a long time 

370.24 379.25 B: and uh there has been a couple of others here and there and it's a very it's a very difficult process and it's difficult enough if there aren't children but when there are children it turns out to be a a real 

379.37 380.11 B: real problem 

381.12 383.31 A: especially depending upon the ages of the kids too 

383.32 383.85 B: yeah 

383.90 391.93 A: my parents divorced when i was five so i don't really remember a lot about it but like at the same time i knew enough to understand what was going on and it's just really h- tough on a kid 

386.10 386.45 B: hm 

397.72 398.17 B: (( get )) the kid 

398.74 406.71 B: the families that we know that are getting divorced actually they they seem on the outside to handle it quite well um they don't 

422.59 424.36 B: um they seem to cope pretty well 

424.71 426.05 B: at least externally i- 

426.72 427.43 B: d- do you 

428.02 430.03 B: i don't know maybe you were five years old you don't remember but 

430.12 432.26 B: but i have you seen other stuff than that 

439.61 440.24 B: hm 

442.64 447.30 A: just tried to make sure that i knew it wasn't my fault and stuff like that and to know that both of my parents still loved me 

444.89 445.40 B: right 

447.52 447.91 B: right 

447.75 455.02 A: but i just think that a lot of th- i mean a lot of times parents get too caught up in the whole dealing with each other and they tend to ignore the kids and you can't let that happen 

452.66 453.02 B: yeah 

454.32 456.51 B: oh did your parents get remarried 

456.72 457.04 A: no 

457.16 457.57 B: no 

457.76 458.15 B: oh 

458.87 464.23 B: so that's interesting so i did it work out okay i mean did you maintain contact with both both sides and did that 

464.40 465.82 A: yeah yeah i've lived with my mom 

465.92 466.29 B: yeah 

466.01 466.94 A: ah so 

467.05 469.96 A: we've grown really close and i have contact with my dad 

470.15 470.81 A: and like 

471.11 476.60 A: it wasn't until the past couple of f- like the past few years that i ha- started having a better relationship with him than i had when i was younger 

476.70 477.07 B: huh 

477.58 480.08 B: did they live in the same community or or n- 

479.68 481.12 A: uh no but he lived like 

481.35 482.67 A: no more than an hour from me 

482.54 482.90 B: oh 

483.05 484.10 B: so that's pretty close by 

483.97 484.25 A: yeah 

493.18 493.96 B: really close by 

494.41 498.96 B: and that's good for the kids i guess because the kids can easily bounce back and forth 

499.12 499.72 B: between the houses 

500.13 502.37 B: uh which i think is is what the plan is going to be but 

502.87 508.76 B: um it's also difficult because a lot of the families like us that are good friends with both sides um 

509.08 512.06 B: sometimes you see them together in the same place and and 

512.19 516.01 B: in the long run i'm sure that will work out but in the short run that can be a little awkward 

516.44 517.48 B: uh it can be a little awkward 

518.76 519.12 B: yeah 

519.95 521.27 B: so i don't h- um 

521.52 524.05 B: what else is there to talk about um 

525.54 526.01 B: hm 

527.36 529.01 A: can't really think of anything um 

529.71 530.78 A: i had something a minute ago 

532.58 533.80 A: oh where are you from 

533.73 537.72 B: oh so i'm i'm from the midwest i i grew up in uh in chicago 

538.10 538.50 A: uh-huh
