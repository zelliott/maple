63.27 63.66 B: i 

64.76 65.89 A: did you wait a long time 

65.18 65.64 B: it was 

65.87 66.92 B: uh no 

68.34 71.11 B: no not at all um i was really surprised 

72.93 74.71 B: you know in the past like sometimes 

76.48 77.40 B: my 

78.38 81.88 B: you know like metal supports in my shoes have like set off the 

86.94 89.53 A: yeah 

87.02 88.48 B: that's a real prob- 

96.66 97.36 B: uh 

99.36 100.58 B: you know i didn't have and pro- it 

101.05 101.37 B: and it 

102.21 103.26 B: it didn't take 

103.51 104.12 B: i mean it took 

104.63 107.54 B: you know five minutes to get through security it was like no problem 

107.99 109.32 B: so i mean it hasn't been 

109.81 112.06 B: it hasn't been uh difficult for me at all 

112.89 113.49 B: uh 

113.80 116.44 B: of course i flew i was flying before 

118.08 119.94 B: you know on a on a day that was not very 

120.34 120.86 B: crowded 

121.17 121.58 A: right 

124.23 125.54 B: you know uh 

125.83 128.40 B: after thanksgiving i think a lot of people 

132.71 133.60 B: after 

133.74 134.41 B: you know 

135.25 139.34 B: a lot of people were flying on sunday and i flew on saturday and it was almost empty 

139.66 141.12 B: but on sunday i heard there were 

141.37 143.52 B: there were long delays because there were so many people 

146.20 146.60 A: well 

148.13 149.03 A: but i think 

149.22 151.24 A: usually around the holidays it's 

151.38 153.73 A: it gets backed up anyway even without 

154.32 158.15 A: you know the extra security measures that they are supposed to be enforcing now 

158.18 158.64 B: mhm 

158.66 159.55 A: it seemed like 

161.11 161.54 B: right 

162.87 163.24 A: so 

163.38 163.78 B: yeah 

163.45 164.05 A: i don't know 

164.98 167.10 B: yeah uh no i think i mean 

167.48 168.33 B: i think it's great 

170.46 171.09 B: uh 

177.93 178.41 A: yeah 

178.61 179.68 B: and uh 

180.47 181.43 B: i just wish 

184.42 186.55 B: uh they could have done this previously 

186.43 186.90 A: yeah 

187.39 188.16 A: i agree 

188.77 189.87 B: but of course they wouldn't have 

189.97 192.35 A: no no it usually takes a catalyst 

192.83 195.23 B: right and you know uh 

196.78 198.24 B: it's it's kind of 

201.03 201.76 B: i mean 

201.93 205.07 B: it's really i mean it ma- it makes me angry the fact that 

207.02 208.52 B: they were known to be unsafe 

209.62 210.08 A: right 

209.89 210.60 B: and 

211.90 212.75 B: basically 

213.13 215.83 B: you know the airlines were too cheap to do anything 

216.08 216.56 A: yeah 

216.84 217.54 B: and 

231.59 234.12 B: you know people don't think about this until it's too late 

234.56 235.02 A: yeah 

235.42 235.93 B: uh 

236.17 238.00 A: well i think in this country we kind of 

238.66 241.74 A: take for granted a lot of a lot of things 

242.24 246.04 A: and i don't think anybody ever really considered that we could be attacked on our own 

246.14 246.72 A: land 

247.27 247.59 B: right 

247.52 249.02 A: which was naive on our part 

249.07 250.48 B: oh it was incredibly stupid 

250.74 251.34 A: it was 

252.12 252.80 B: uh 

252.15 253.90 A: but i you know i do think 

254.10 256.32 A: that before september eleventh we really 

256.57 257.86 A: had no clue 

258.42 259.98 A: that this could happen 

259.16 260.91 B: well some p- some people had a clue 

261.34 262.47 A: right 

262.00 264.82 B: you know gary hart and uh whoever else wrote 

267.31 268.77 B: they wrote a big report about 

269.58 269.96 A: mhm 

271.27 272.03 B: completely ignore it 

272.29 272.73 A: yeah 

272.66 273.33 B: uh 

273.83 274.33 B: and it 

276.89 277.99 B: you know i mean 

279.29 280.82 B: stupid are they they're supposed to be 

281.75 284.68 B: they're supposed to be responsible for national security and 

288.42 292.36 B: i mean i don't know it just it just bothers me 

292.59 293.26 B: uh 

293.11 294.29 A: i can understand that 

297.35 297.73 A: i guess 

298.47 300.08 A: my feeling is i mean 

301.08 303.36 A: there were people that knew about it 

303.70 305.99 A: but i think they didn't take the steps nec- 

306.09 307.16 A: -ssary to prevent it 

307.66 309.91 A: but i think even the changes that we've made 

310.30 311.43 A: i don't think are enough 

311.80 314.37 A: i mean yes we've heightened security at airports 

314.96 317.55 A: but i mean the united states is a big country 

317.68 319.87 B: yeah it's huge and we have porous borders 

320.44 324.05 A: right i mean we've always had kind of an open door policy 

321.12 321.78 B: uh 

324.48 325.52 A: which i think 

325.94 327.81 A: sets us up for terrorist attacks 

327.69 330.28 B: right i mean we have an open society too 

330.30 330.84 A: yeah 

331.03 331.75 B: uh 

332.15 334.10 A: which i don't want to do away with 

334.49 335.13 B: yes 

334.50 336.11 A: but i think we have to 

337.32 342.28 A: understand that it is a big country and that not every inch of it is going to be covered 

342.68 343.05 B: right 

343.42 344.32 B: right and 

344.84 346.91 B: uh it it also bothers me that 

347.67 349.03 B: you know um 

350.74 351.29 B: the 

351.49 353.89 B: the f._b._i. was prohibited from doing 

354.10 355.18 B: you know domestic 

356.51 356.98 B: like 

357.17 358.06 B: i mean they couldn't 

358.95 359.83 B: they couldn't even 

360.07 361.26 B: go to places like 

361.38 363.05 B: mosques they couldn't go there 

363.20 364.04 B: and 

364.62 368.25 B: you know just to find out if anybody was doing anything it was like they were prohibited 

368.34 368.86 A: yeah 

368.36 369.70 B: uh 

369.97 371.38 B: and that really makes me 

372.12 373.37 B: i mean it makes me angry 

373.63 374.10 A: yeah 

374.88 375.59 A: i guess 

376.67 377.40 A: my 

377.79 382.24 B: i mean i know they were reacting to excesses in the sixties 

383.01 383.76 B: uh 

384.47 386.03 B: you know by the f._b._i. who were 

386.68 388.99 B: who were harassing people and so on but 

391.19 391.74 A: yeah 

392.16 393.31 A: i don't know if we'll ever be able 

393.40 395.87 A: find a good balance between like you know 

396.76 398.59 A: your own personal rights and 

399.28 399.98 A: and 

400.17 402.71 A: you know how much the government should control 

400.24 401.25 B: security 

403.41 406.53 A: you know do i want the government to know every move i make 

407.57 408.18 A: no 

408.52 409.13 A: but 

408.92 412.37 B: unless you're a terrorist 

409.96 413.19 A: yeah but then how do you you know 

414.15 415.37 A: how do you you know 

415.54 416.23 A: prevent 

416.63 419.50 A: them from doing that to someone who's not a terrorist 

419.73 421.68 B: well uh i mean for one thing 

423.38 424.41 B: it amazed me that 

425.55 427.57 B: that uh the i._n._s. wasn't ke- 

427.76 428.86 B: was wasn't keeping 

429.38 432.31 B: you know records of like who was in the country 

430.53 432.61 A: yeah that's kind of scary 

432.45 434.25 B: i mean students especially 

434.34 435.04 A: yeah 

435.30 436.01 B: uh 

436.43 437.22 A: but also 

437.71 444.78 A: i found it amazing like these terrorists were (( abre )) were able if i remember correctly were able to get their airline tickets through the internet 

445.77 448.03 A: and i know like when you call and get airline tickets 

448.26 450.31 A: they kind of do like a little profile on you 

451.46 454.27 A: but when you go through the internet there's no profiling done 

454.84 455.25 B: right 

456.49 457.22 A: so i mean 

457.70 458.60 A: there's another 

458.76 460.94 A: you know the internet is another big 

462.60 464.78 A: kind of factor i guess 

464.55 464.90 B: yeah 

465.93 466.43 B: yeah it 

469.44 470.10 B: i mean 

472.48 473.48 B: such a huge job 

474.01 474.47 A: it is 

484.22 484.71 B: you know 

484.81 486.26 B: foreigners coming in everyday 

486.50 486.94 A: right 

487.42 490.11 B: uh you know and it's not just foreigners you have to worry about 

490.39 491.56 A: no not at all 

491.83 492.49 B: i mean 

493.39 494.66 B: look at timothy mcveigh 

494.86 495.33 A: yeah 

498.61 499.06 B: so 

499.69 500.62 B: yeah i mean it's 

501.08 502.86 B: it's a huge it's a huge problem 

504.56 508.09 A: yeah and unfortunately there really doesn't seem to be any easy answers for it 

509.09 509.38 B: but 

510.48 511.86 B: i'm hopeful that at least 

513.59 515.70 B: you know people realize the problem now 

516.28 516.73 A: yeah 

517.04 517.68 B: and 

519.28 522.25 B: you know things may get done slowly but 

523.08 525.04 B: but at least people recognize the need 

525.48 526.29 B: to get them done 

527.17 531.95 B: i mean i was really surprised when when i was fourteen uh i went to visit a friend in london 

532.17 532.52 A: mhm 

532.56 533.03 B: and 

533.38 534.42 B: i couldn't believe it 

535.03 535.79 B: there were 

535.91 537.25 B: signs everywhere 

537.67 539.50 B: do not leave your bags unattended 

540.55 541.59 B: um and i'm like 

542.13 543.08 B: what's that all about 

543.86 545.06 B: and my friend said well 

545.24 546.33 B: there's been terrorism 

546.90 547.38 B: you know 

547.53 548.01 A: mhm 

548.12 548.69 B: uh 

549.40 552.23 B: i mean they've been dealing with this for years and years and years and years 

552.25 552.75 A: yeah 

553.17 553.86 B: uh 

554.35 556.12 B: you know but we never got serious about it 

556.34 557.19 A: no we didn't 

557.81 558.42 B: uh 

559.95 560.60 B: so 

561.29 563.73 B: that's like other countries have been dealing with this a long time 

564.73 565.17 A: yeah 

565.13 566.28 B: we should have really
