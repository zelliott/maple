0.12 1.45 A: hello 

0.86 2.44 B: hi i'm genie 

2.04 3.71 A: hi i'm alexis 

4.40 6.31 B: so what was the question [laughter] 

5.50 13.64 A: the question was um airport security and whether we think that it lessened the chances of terrorist attacks 

13.01 14.21 B: there you go 

14.64 15.92 A: (( ah )) 

15.95 17.49 A: my feeling is 

17.50 19.00 A: probably 

19.08 27.65 A: um i think that you know i'm kind of surprised that airport security hasn't been tight anyway 

27.64 39.60 A: but i guess if there're people there who are you know looking around and um watching what's going on there's less of a chance of bad things going on 

39.81 43.72 B: well that's true and i i guess i think if we're gonna have it we should have it 

43.56 45.04 A: yeah 

44.05 47.63 B: good security [laughter] why call it security if 

45.06 46.52 A: yeah clearly 

47.64 51.15 B: you don't really have it people are just kinda sitting there watching stuff go by 

51.17 57.82 A: yeah i always traveling um during holidays and things like that i always felt like it was kind of strange they 

58.24 64.37 A: back in ah i mean back pre-september eleventh i guess and pre all of these changes 

64.23 73.70 A: they didn't pay those people well and really they were just you know your average guy off the street checking through bags what do they care 

66.67 67.49 B: right 

73.80 77.50 B: right big overweight [laughter] yeah yeah 

73.88 77.13 A: i always thought that was really strange yeah [laughter] 

77.33 80.34 A: that they would have that as their system [laughter] 

80.83 87.41 B: yep so [sigh] i agree i do think it makes it a little hard like i know my husband travels a lot and he was gonna be coming home 

87.87 95.25 B: from i forget where but he's been gone for a while i said well i could actually park and come in and get you and he goes you can't do that anyways [laughter] 

94.63 96.73 A: yeah it doesn't work out 

95.43 101.80 B: because yeah usually i just drop him off at the um at the entrance and pick him up at the entrance 

101.60 103.89 A: you don't really have any choice now 

102.03 102.60 B: (( [laughter] )) 

103.70 111.34 B: right right but since i've always done that i didn't really know that [laughter] i couldn't you know go all the way to the gate and wave goodbye through the window 

104.09 105.05 A: yeah 

106.19 108.17 A: [laughter] oh right 

111.06 112.69 A: yeah yeah 

112.06 113.68 B: you know the good old days 

113.69 114.52 B: uh 

114.98 127.96 A: i guess that is a difference um my mom can't come and meet me at the gate anymore and that's kind of a downer you know you get off the plane and you feel like a little lost traveler as opposed to [laughter] you're like you're going home 

122.17 123.23 B: i know 

126.14 127.18 B: [laughter] 

127.54 129.71 B: right being enveloped by the 

129.26 132.46 A: it's not as not as friendly i guess but 

129.98 131.30 B: (( arms when you get there )) 

131.57 134.00 B: right right but 

132.99 134.45 A: process the plane 

134.37 136.11 B: yeah so 

137.43 142.71 B: as well as as regards whether it actually reduces terrorism 

143.08 152.40 B: i'm sure they could find other ways to do it you know everything's been in the news recently you know people started watching the you know the big uh 

145.38 146.39 A: yeah 

153.06 157.28 B: trucks that go across country you know they've got a lot of fuel too so 

155.21 156.15 A: uh-huh 

157.35 159.79 B: um i guess to some extent i 

157.75 159.01 A: yeah 

159.98 162.00 B: figure where there's a will there's a way 

162.29 164.88 A: yeah and that's a 

164.97 169.76 A: relatively unsettling just in terms of you know your general comfort 

169.97 175.56 A: i um we generally tend to drive a lot more than we fly just anyway 

174.14 175.02 B: mhm 

175.21 176.13 B: mhm 

175.52 186.51 A: um not for any reason other than it's just more convenient but ah there are a lot of tr- big trucks and they look pretty scary they could do a lot of damage [laughter] 

184.12 184.73 B: (( [laughter] )) 

185.26 200.14 B: well it's probably you know driving a regular car is probably the most dangerous thing you can do [laughter] i know when we [sigh] back in eighty seven we flew over to israel and even then you know there's just been some attack on 

191.03 191.99 A: true 

200.72 215.69 B: oh i forget exactly what it was [sigh] i think it was a a cruise ship or something and um you know some people were kind of bantering about the whole terrorist part and they gave out a little pamphlet called living with uh terrorism 

215.98 224.14 B: and it said that more people die in their bathtubs every year than are killed by terrorist attacks [laughter] 

216.75 217.96 A: really 

221.56 222.73 A: (( [laughter] )) 

223.85 225.32 A: oh wow [laughter] 

224.66 228.44 B: so you have to think well i take a shower every day [laughter] 

227.03 230.36 A: yeah that's a wakeup call [laughter] 

228.60 234.67 B: you you know and and the people who you know slip and you know wham their head on their lovely 

235.13 239.63 B: cast iron and kill themselves like don't they get into the headlines worldwide [laughter] 

239.25 240.66 A: it's true 

240.08 242.58 B: you know whereas the terrorist attacks do 

242.83 245.30 A: i guess that gives you a better perspective 

244.95 251.64 B: right you know or you i think we went to an aquarium once and they were talking about shark attacks and you know more people are killed by pigs than by sharks 

248.89 249.81 A: [laughter] 

251.07 252.94 A: [laughter] 

251.70 255.63 B: and i went oh wow i don't run around -round saying oh my gosh i'm scared of pigs 

255.08 258.94 A: [laughter] oh dear that's kinda funny 

256.38 257.52 B: um 

258.48 266.01 B: so y- you know it's kind of a you kind of have to walk the middle of the road saying you know i'm gonna live my life kinda take 

266.09 275.45 B: you know some general precautions but you know you just have to keep on going because you never know where the problem's gonna lie 

271.24 272.10 A: (( yes )) 

275.21 277.09 A: it's true it's very true 

276.59 287.61 B: so it's kind of you know if you really look at it it's kind of odd you know now that [sigh] september eleventh really pointed out the flaw in the airport security 

287.10 288.06 A: mhm 

287.49 292.16 B: now that's been all beefed up tightened up like that's the only way that people can do terrorism 

292.34 295.96 A: it's a very limited view of the way the world works [laughter] yeah 

293.79 300.57 B: [laughter] right so now we feel very safe and you know if i guess if terrorists were smart then they would look for another 

300.61 304.43 B: area that is kind of as lax as airport security used to be 

304.18 305.50 A: yeah 

304.87 306.74 B: um [sigh] 

305.77 307.82 A: and i'm sure there's something 

308.10 310.31 A: you know i'm sure it's there somewhere 

310.05 312.99 B: right right but you know perhaps 

310.81 312.74 A: it's probably any number of things 

313.11 316.46 B: we should be looking a little more at um [lipsmack] 

316.61 320.09 B: you know real foreign relations [laughter] so we get along 

318.73 322.31 A: that's that's always been my point [laughter] you know 

321.05 323.62 B: how our country pisses other countries off 

322.92 328.57 A: why would it be that they would be angry [laughter] is it justified at all 

325.53 327.12 B: oh my gosh you think 

328.31 332.64 B: right right and you know can we work something out can we be a global community 

328.91 329.62 A: mhm 

332.85 333.91 B: um 

333.95 338.28 B: [sigh] somehow you know everybody compromising a little bit so we don't all have to go 

336.78 337.97 A: yeah 

338.42 345.90 A: i agree with you wholeheartedly [laughter] and now all we have to do is work on the people who are in charge [laughter] 

339.66 341.66 B: [laughter] 

344.37 349.20 B: [laughter] there you go well we try you know we try to vote [laughter] 

347.57 350.25 A: yeah yeah it's true it's true 

349.91 353.59 B: oh well that's that's another discussion [laughter] 

352.31 356.02 A: [laughter] yeah we probably shouldn't we should probably stay on topic 

354.69 357.32 B: (( in calif- in florida yeah )) 

356.58 357.67 A: yeah 

357.76 362.51 A: um so one thing that has struck me about the enforc- 

357.83 358.42 B: (( oh )) 

362.43 367.46 A: the reinforcing security and making everything all tight is the people who 

367.33 371.44 A: are just so impatient with the process 

371.30 384.18 A: and you know that those are the same people who are screaming and yelling about not feeling safe on airplanes and they just cannot stand the fact that they have to stand in line for twenty minutes to have their bags checked 

384.11 388.41 A: that just sickened me last christmas it was it was really awful 

388.38 395.59 A: this one girl was said something about how it was absolutely insane that she should have her 

395.48 409.41 A: whatever her bag checked again because she had already been on a plane and she would have just blown up the last one if she was going to blow up any plane i'm like oh dear don't say things like that in line at the airport anymore 

408.40 410.29 B: (( i know really )) 

409.37 411.31 A: this really really 

411.38 424.31 A: just really not smart [laughter] so i don't know i don't understand these people that just can't you know you get there earlier you know you wait in line 

419.79 420.40 B: (( wow )) 

422.15 429.80 B: well you know it's just one of those it's not me obviously how come they don't know that [laughter] they need to take care of all the bad people i wouldn't be one of those people 

425.96 427.73 A: yeah i don't get it 

429.33 432.52 A: yeah that's just really strange to me 

431.13 439.49 B: now my husband kinda had the opposite view 'cause he was one of the people kinda picked out of line who the whatever search more carefully 

435.71 436.87 A: mhm 

439.12 440.34 A: mhm 

439.64 443.23 B: and he took um i think he took three flights that day 

443.33 453.58 B: and he was picked out of a line on all three flights and he goes oh there must be a certain profile for today and i'm it [laughter] and he says you know if that's true and that gets out there 

446.36 447.62 A: oh 

448.04 449.14 A: yeah 

449.41 451.61 A: [laughter] yeah i guess so 

453.72 463.82 B: and if you go on your first flight and you're not picked out of the line you know then you could you know pick up something you know pick up a pair of box cutters and throw it in 'cause we won't get picked out in the line 

457.20 458.42 A: right 

463.61 464.77 A: right 

464.30 465.36 B: um 

465.41 471.52 B: you know so your friend's like oh well i would have blown up well you can you can get stuff at the the next airport 

471.40 472.82 A: yeah i guess 

472.10 475.27 B: you know so they can't really [sigh] 

475.38 479.75 B: um you know if if we want tightened security then we all have to 

479.87 481.13 B: deal with it 

480.44 489.03 A: you just have to be patient you can't your know freak out about things know it you maybe you're not a terrorist but 

482.58 484.21 B: right 

485.46 486.23 B: right 

490.07 491.33 A: (( i don't know )) 

490.09 493.69 B: well obviously they didn't think the people who were were either 

493.08 495.82 A: exactly [laughter] exactly 

496.19 497.50 A: (( i don't know )) 

497.77 503.41 A: long lines at the airport generally when i fly it's all crowded anyway so it's not really a 

497.96 498.57 B: (( [laughter] )) 

503.64 505.36 B: right [laughter] 

503.93 507.00 A: a big difference or a big surprise i 

507.67 508.80 A: (( don't know )) 

508.43 514.13 B: yeah the first time my husband got there he went like three hours early you know and boom he's through the line nothing to do [laughter] 

511.71 512.66 A: uh-huh 

513.71 515.34 A: oh dear [laughter] 

514.27 517.49 B: you know he had to wait for like two hours sitting reading the newspaper or something 

517.24 518.50 A: wow 

517.93 522.04 B: um but you know we're not [sigh] we're up in upstate new york where 

522.23 528.03 B: um yeah it's an international airport but i don't think there're many international flights [laughter] picked up out of it 

526.75 534.35 A: right i'm in philadelphia so there i mean it's a big airport and there're a lot of people going through that and 

531.77 532.65 B: yeah 

534.68 546.44 A: it really it honestly the first time we flew after um september eleventh it literally took us about ninety minutes to get through the line 

544.68 545.58 B: wow 

546.75 547.72 B: wow 

547.40 554.24 A: absolutely crazy the airport was just m- mayhem [laughter] it was like absolutely out of hand 

551.21 557.85 B: [laughter] i i remember before this was probably about four years ago i flew to dallas 

557.40 558.71 A: mhm 

558.12 564.62 B: and here was this huge airport and you could enter it at fifty million points of entry 

560.48 562.25 A: (( yeah dallas is enormous )) 

564.31 565.94 A: yeah 

564.48 578.33 B: you know rather than going in one gate and then walking down these long concourses with no entry onto the outside you just you know got left off walked in went through a little you know airport security thing and boom you're at the gate and i'm like 

574.81 575.71 A: uh-huh 

577.69 589.13 A: i'm actually from dallas and it's still like that they have yeah i mean there's security at every door but really there're a lot of ways i mean if you have your ticket you can get in 

580.21 581.59 B: really 

589.39 592.33 A: really really easily it's not far 

590.73 595.48 B: right and you don't have to like walk down these like gargantuan hallways [laughter] 

593.69 604.57 A: mhm it's just i guess the way their airport is designed and and frankly it's it's pretty good actually with the new system and the new security because you have a lot more options 

597.02 598.30 B: that must be 

604.73 610.49 A: um so the lines that i've seen haven't been as backed up and you know the 

610.47 621.95 A: yeah maybe that's more people to watch in terms of the security but in terms of the you know end users experience i must say [laughter] i like that airport better 

621.36 629.70 B: well you know it maybe it maybe that the security person's job is easier than because they're not dealing with such highly frustrated people 

625.47 626.63 A: (( mhm )) 

629.10 630.94 A: (( truly yeah )) 

629.89 640.76 B: you know they waited in a little line they understand what you're doing but the line moves as opposed to if you know two checkers are doing like fifteen gates worth of people by the time you get through 

639.21 640.16 A: (( yes )) 

641.18 645.67 B: you know you're yelling at the security guard and it's not their fault [laughter] 

645.12 657.07 A: yeah yeah one thing i feel a little sorry for um the philadelphia airport was just redesigned um like all the inside and all the stores and this and that and the other 

646.01 647.49 B: yeah so 

655.59 656.82 B: mhm 

657.03 668.95 A: um so they have some you know pretty interesting stores and lots of themes and the idea i guess was that while you wait for people to arrive you can go and do all this shopping 

668.59 669.76 B: oh i see 

669.34 678.94 A: now these stores are on the other side of security there's no shopping going on and i think they just are all suffering seriously from this 

678.98 680.79 A: um just uh 

680.72 686.29 B: i can imagine 'cause it seemed to me the people that are st- you know are layovers [laughter] are the ones that do the shopping 

685.92 688.08 A: yeah exactly 

687.80 692.22 B: and do do they really want to go through security just to go shop and then have to come through again 

691.88 695.64 A: yeah so it's it's a shame [laughter] 

692.70 693.94 B: (( yeah )) 

695.95 697.37 A: for those people 

696.03 696.92 B: yep 

697.62 699.34 B: (( i can see how that would be )) 

699.07 700.69 A: yeah 

702.26 705.29 A: well [sigh] um hmm 

705.61 706.87 A: [laughter] 

706.12 706.72 B: (( so )) 

711.74 714.33 B: what else can we talk about [laughter] 

712.91 716.75 A: i was gonna say it's hard to fill up ten minutes um 

715.92 718.84 B: i know you think ten minutes goes by so quickly [laughter] 

718.36 719.90 A: yeah it's it's harder
