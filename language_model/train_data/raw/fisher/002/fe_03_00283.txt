192.12 192.90 B: sure 

194.87 197.66 B: it's very strange that 

197.82 198.56 B: [laughter] 

198.80 202.93 B: american planes they didn't have it before i mean 

202.24 203.14 A: right

203.46 208.69 A: even doors [laughter] doors to the cockpit they didn't have i mean you know 

207.51 212.01 B: [laughter] and now they're going to arm the the pilot in the cockpit

220.23 221.55 A: yeah 

220.65 223.68 B: pilot i mean how can the pilot be 

224.24 228.62 B: be flying the plane and taking care of terrorists at the same time 

228.40 239.53 A: and how can he shoot a gun in a plane that's twenty thousand feet if if the bullet goes through the side of the plane the it'll depressurize and everybody will die [laughter] you 

239.45 240.92 B: mhm mhm 

241.39 242.93 A: know i think that's just 

242.48 252.66 B: yeah no the israelis are the best for security they really are they trained they trained the time before the revolution the time of the shah 

252.63 253.44 A: uh-huh 

252.89 254.63 B: they trained 

254.83 263.49 B: our security system and from then onwards we always had in every section of the plane even now 

256.65 257.93 A: oh yeah 

263.51 264.82 B: they have 

264.89 266.28 B: an armed 

266.55 273.54 B: person who doesn't who doesn't who looks like ordinary but he's armed and he's sitting there among the passengers 

271.82 274.48 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

274.34 279.42 B: so nobody can can you know sort of uh hijack a plane or 

279.73 290.94 A: right yeah well i i was sort of proud of the uh of the um passengers on the plane that that fought against the uh hijackers 

290.07 292.18 B: yes yes yes sure 

291.42 294.20 A: although it appears the hijackers on another plane 

293.51 295.06 B: (( [sigh] )) 

294.44 296.14 A: yeah so they couldn't 

296.31 297.85 A: they couldn't react 

297.84 298.89 B: (( mm )) 

298.27 302.78 A: so maybe that was why they didn't protest but who would think such a thing would happen anyway 

302.77 305.24 B: no no well you know 

305.55 307.71 B: planes have been hijacked 

307.76 321.21 B: so many times in since i mean for the last twenty or maybe twenty five years but you know to think that one country is an exception except also to

332.14 332.80 A: (( i know )) 

333.38 343.37 A: i'm afraid this whole crisis is showing what is to in my opinion the very worst of american character dependent on guns 

343.47 346.68 A: ah hatred of people who are not like you 

346.84 356.37 A: you know a certain number of people in the country and ah this ah feeling of superiority that they are not you can't touch them 

356.70 359.72 A: that they're invincible arrogance
