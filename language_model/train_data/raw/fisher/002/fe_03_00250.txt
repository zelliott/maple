22.61 23.06 B: right 

23.15 23.63 A: okay 

23.90 27.29 A: so what do you think what wh- what have you changed 

27.63 28.22 A: personally 

28.00 30.97 B: ah you go first 

29.24 29.84 A: huh 

30.37 33.64 A: let's see um 

34.01 34.55 A: [breath] 

34.94 37.28 A: i think i've become more tolerant 

37.44 37.96 B: uh-huh 

37.85 39.08 A: and more open um 

39.54 42.08 A: a litt- definitely listen more um 

41.26 41.94 B: yeah 

42.71 43.61 A: i um 

43.76 52.69 A: people are very different from from me or do things different- differently from the way i do them i tend to kind of pay attention and try to see if that way 

52.72 53.43 B: right 

52.80 56.33 A: and try to find common ground as oppose to as opposed to ah 

57.28 60.81 A: as opposed to as differences 

60.99 61.61 B: yeah 

61.99 64.99 A: so in in in that sense i think i think um 

65.43 66.52 A: that has 

67.38 68.64 A: i have changed that since 

68.88 69.48 B: right 

69.77 73.07 A: and so and obviously i've become more aware of um 

73.53 82.14 A: of events outside the states and and um even more interesting foreign policy issues and things of this sort 

82.41 83.76 B: right yeah 

82.96 84.52 A: so that i can open my eyes up 

84.78 85.41 B: right 

85.15 86.87 A: a little bit more on on um 

87.78 88.45 A: on this 

89.27 89.86 B: yeah 

90.27 91.08 A: and um 

92.29 92.87 A: what about you 

92.84 96.34 B: [breath] pretty similar i mean i think i've just been a little more 

96.71 100.31 B: you know considerate of other people's situations and 

99.68 100.05 A: mhm 

100.99 105.29 B: just sort of wondering if how people are affected and thinking about it more 

104.87 105.23 A: mhm 

105.46 105.98 B: um 

106.23 115.19 B: and then also just being a little bit more um cautious about i don't know maybe reading the newspaper more often watching the news more often 

113.30 113.65 A: mhm 

115.08 115.41 A: mhm 

115.32 120.96 B: um just thinking about what it means for future kids things like that 

119.81 120.58 A: mhm mhm 

120.97 121.24 A: mhm 

121.66 128.40 B: um but i i think i've made direct changes in my life by just like you were saying just being more aware of what's going on in the world 

128.46 129.22 A: oh absolutely 

130.05 131.63 A: absolutely yeah and um 

132.41 133.81 A: so in in that sense 

134.57 136.07 A: well obviously ah 

137.01 142.10 A: i i think it still a month ago sometime for split seconds i say no way did it happen 

142.33 143.12 B: right 

142.72 143.64 A: you know ah 

143.74 146.99 A: i'm shocked in in that i'm still denying it in a sense 

147.16 147.51 A: you know 

147.93 149.95 A: for split seconds nah uh that didn't happen no way 

150.12 150.79 B: right 

150.56 154.44 A: it is just too it is just too ah significant of an event 

158.25 160.82 A: god and then the way it happened [breath] i i i 

159.92 162.34 B: [breath] it's just so surprising and unbelievable 

162.17 164.56 A: (( )) and i remember the first day tuesday 

165.14 166.67 A: i just was ah 

168.06 169.44 A: i was in ah what 

169.59 172.54 A: tuesday happened on tuesday i remember that day i was just in denial 

173.00 173.89 B: yeah 

173.33 174.37 A: i was (( going on uh-uh )) 

174.69 176.81 A: i was just laughing it off things like that 

177.59 181.01 A: fo- wednesday, thursday, friday i was completely um 

181.31 186.98 A: i think w- when it hit me and it settled inside me a little bit it really ah 

187.74 189.73 A: it really got me down really depressed me actually 

189.86 190.81 B: yeah 

190.39 195.06 A: but then it took me some time to i had to actually come to terms with that stuff and you know make sure that 

196.08 198.45 A: (( )) doing what's right and 

199.36 199.93 B: right 

199.41 201.16 A: going through the motions 

201.14 201.83 B: right 

205.16 207.99 B: [breath] i think it's true in that it it sneaks back up on me at different 

208.45 211.05 B: pla- you know i'll be at a movie i'll be somewhere where i 

211.25 214.82 B: i wo- wouldn't necessarily think i'd be thinking about it and then it would come up 

214.99 215.31 A: yeah 

215.09 220.65 B: um and then it'll be somewhere when i where it's the top of discussion and i won't be thinking it sort of comes surprising 

219.31 219.59 A: um 

220.50 221.05 A: mhm 

222.05 228.93 A: after the way it happens it's out of out of a fiction book or something it's like what it's like movies (( )) movies would even do it this way 

225.03 226.17 B: yeah right 

228.37 229.45 B: exactly 

229.16 231.94 A: i'm like what e- it was it was a 

232.62 236.57 A: it was definitely ah (( )) obviously (( impacted )) everybody for sure 

236.15 237.53 B: exactly it was 

237.18 239.22 A: in one way or any other did you lose anyone ah 

239.27 240.43 B: i did not 

240.55 240.99 A: okay 

240.55 241.48 B: what about you

243.19 243.64 A: thank god 

243.84 244.60 A: ah, none 

245.70 248.63 A: um no no it's it's just looking at looking at 

248.75 249.57 A: at some um 

250.27 252.36 A: scenes on t._v. it's just really 

252.98 253.65 A: um 

254.07 257.88 A: one thing that that thi- scene scene i will never forget he said that this 

258.84 259.24 A: um 

259.74 260.81 A: for someone to ah

272.52 273.40 B: i know 

274.25 275.80 A: can you imagine being put in that situation 

276.02 283.83 B: i cannot i know it just th- those pictures are the most disturbing for me actually i always think about the people in the airplane too 

276.89 278.12 A: it it's eh 

281.29 281.63 A: i 

284.05 284.51 A: what

290.38 291.16 B: yeah 

291.57 292.73 A: i can't imagine what 

292.53 296.51 B: kind of makes you like tighter with your families right like for me

300.06 300.71 B: close with 

301.53 303.95 A: i'm not ah i don't think you know but i'm 

304.41 311.44 A: i'm arab i'm also muslim and so [breath] this this thing was (( impacted )) more directly in having to actually deal for a while with people and 

309.38 310.43 B: oh 

311.69 313.01 B: yeah of course 

314.13 316.89 A: ah those (( attacks )) against people and things like that 

317.20 321.71 A: so i mean nothing happened to me but you know i ah people were asking me ah 

321.93 322.31 A: why is that 

322.40 333.43 A: for instance i went to radio shack um like the third day and the guy that the salesman goes ah out (( )) i mean the (( )) he said ah can i ask you a question i said yeah he goes ah 

333.53 335.90 A: ah did you want to (( )) anything like that 

336.06 339.33 A: ah to me in fact that he asked that question you know it's it's ah 

340.05 342.32 A: it's ah how should i say it 

342.56 343.35 A: it's a little bit 

343.44 346.49 A: it was a little bit ah not dis- disturbing in a sense 

346.76 348.27 B: hm yeah 

347.47 349.39 A: and and so was ah (( anyway )) 

349.59 350.38 A: it was ah 

351.23 352.16 A: obviously i was more 

352.65 354.49 A: more impacted directed f- you know 

355.06 355.70 A: this week 

355.43 356.51 B: right 

356.00 357.76 A: just because i'm you know and arab 

360.52 362.54 A: so what when i i think another thing that that 

362.79 364.21 A: that i really started 

364.21 364.85 A: doing is that 

365.19 366.29 A: really trying to 

366.60 366.93 A: um 

367.35 367.93 A: to present the 

368.00 369.52 A: the culture arab culture 

369.98 371.05 A: present a little bit to people 

371.20 371.86 B: uh-huh 

371.36 372.06 A: you know 

372.30 374.96 A: where where really what it's about and stuff 

375.13 377.71 A: it's not all about you know even (( islam itself )) 

377.71 379.95 A: you know but i mean killing (( )) none of this stuff 

380.38 381.58 A: you can go on and on all this 

381.76 388.64 A: the subject but um but the (( )) i i think to a lot of people is a completely foreign thing 

388.77 389.47 B: yeah 

389.16 396.36 A: you know and so what i'm trying to do right now is whenever possible of course to (( )) obviously (( to light to light )) to a certain degree 

396.85 405.43 A: um i guess kind of give an idea a little bit you know just give them give people things to look for um give the (( )) (( more resources )) (( )) you could put it this way 

405.63 408.30 A: so that they can research stuff on their own and and um 

408.56 409.61 A: and what have you 

410.06 414.50 A: and so um, (( )) that was that was a ah
