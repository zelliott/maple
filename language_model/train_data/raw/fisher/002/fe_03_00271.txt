51.86 60.84 A: made any traumatic changes or changes that i would qualify as a direct result of september eleventh though i think there are probably a lot of things that have happened 

61.31 62.78 A: you know kind of 

63.98 69.54 A: as a result of september eleventh that i've kind of shaped and effected my life in ways that are beyond my control do you know what i mean 

69.67 70.17 B: yeah 

70.37 70.75 A: uh-huh 

70.89 71.26 B: yeah 

71.65 72.73 A: and um 

73.82 74.71 A: like conscious 

75.22 77.84 A: choice though that i made i'm a language teacher and 

77.61 77.90 B: mhm 

78.37 78.77 A: as 

78.98 82.48 A: the result of september eleventh one of the things that i kind of consciously did was 

83.37 87.39 A: change the way in which i approach 

88.78 96.44 A: language teaching in terms of uh the way we talk about culture in you know like the foreign language classroom and 

96.17 96.63 B: yeah 

96.86 102.32 A: the kinds of goals you know i always was very explicit in terms of cultural teaching but 

102.80 105.23 A: the teaching you know that i really now kind of 

105.49 108.29 A: prescribe to and really encourage my students to um 

114.95 120.55 A: you know is think about how we fit in to the rest of the world and the way you know the way the rest of the world kind of shapes 

122.72 123.57 A: the way our perception 

128.38 128.79 B: mhm 

128.49 131.98 A: kind of been an an interesting you know like free examination of how 

132.58 133.83 A: i view culture and language 

133.92 140.03 A: classroom and like the significance of culture you know in a language classroom so it's been kind of an interesting period of time and 

135.92 136.37 B: mhm 

140.17 141.39 A: do you know there's a lot of 

142.71 143.47 A: is there are 

143.61 151.67 A: trends right now you know within language study i think that have become you know increasingly like significant and more apparent you know as a result of september eleventh and so 

144.98 145.27 B: yeah 

151.77 155.07 A: you know professionally i suppose i've been very impacted by september eleventh 

156.51 157.51 B: well that's interesting 

158.25 159.01 B: i'm a student 

159.13 159.49 B: so 

160.44 160.92 B: um 

162.06 162.49 B: i guess 

162.66 163.16 B: i guess 

163.70 164.35 B: to be honest 

164.47 164.93 B: i mean 

166.47 168.15 B: it probably in a way 

169.67 170.72 B: it made me 

171.64 172.50 B: less eager 

173.34 174.20 B: because um 

174.68 175.97 B: this is my first year of college 

176.31 176.73 A: uh-huh 

176.73 182.62 B: and so last year when all of that was going on i was applying to school and deciding where i wanted to go and everything 

182.96 188.28 B: and i remember the day that it happened i came home and i said mom i said i can't go this far away 

188.29 188.95 A: sure 

188.98 195.41 B: because you know it's just a scary thing to think that you know something could happen and you wouldn't i mean i'm still considerably far from home but 

195.86 200.38 B: but it's a scary to think that something could happen and you absolutely couldn't get to your family or 

200.72 201.58 B: you know you wouldn't 

201.83 202.65 B: you wouldn't be 

203.15 204.51 B: with them and i think that 

204.93 208.39 B: you know it for me it kind of strengthened my sense of you know 

209.53 209.97 B: of 

210.25 211.80 B: of identity somehow 

212.11 212.59 A: uh-huh 

212.62 213.83 B: not only you know 

214.20 215.12 B: in um 

215.91 216.38 B: you know 

217.52 218.97 B: as a as a nation but 

219.37 221.24 B: but even like regionally you know 

221.87 226.06 B: you kind of look around and you say you know what are the values of the people around me and 

228.17 230.26 B: so i think that it it made me like want to 

231.86 232.67 B: i 

234.21 237.59 B: to to preserve that but also to to kind of challenge that 

238.22 239.81 B: and and i think that was something that i 

240.12 241.13 B: kind of used when i 

241.39 243.25 B: and it was certainly in the back of my mind when i 

243.35 244.91 B: deciding where i was going to go and 

245.39 248.55 B: you know what i wanted to pursue as far as a career and everything you know 

248.79 249.23 A: right 

248.90 251.95 B: and i've been really interested in like international travel and 

252.20 256.66 B: on the one hand it makes you kind of afraid but on the other hand it makes you even more eager to get out 

256.82 257.53 B: outside of the 

258.04 258.67 B: boundaries 

259.55 259.92 B: you know 

260.63 262.12 B: i guess you've always perceived 

262.46 265.73 A: right and the boundaries that kind of really define our existence you know 

262.64 263.05 B: especially 

265.44 266.15 B: exactly 

266.71 267.16 A: um 

267.93 269.09 A: yeah i mean i think 

269.42 270.27 A: it's 

270.61 273.75 A: you put that wonderfully you know in terms of you know like how 

274.61 275.19 A: -spective 

276.27 278.48 A: was changed by september eleventh 

278.99 286.33 A: you know not just in terms of like where you wanted to go to school but just per- perspective you know and on so many different levels yeah i think that's really 

281.64 282.05 B: yeah 

285.25 285.77 B: mhm 

287.32 288.15 A: you know almost 

288.38 290.60 A: poetically and eloquently put (( )) 

290.56 292.47 B: well i'm an english major so 

292.41 293.52 A: yeah oh i see oh 

293.23 297.17 B: well it's just made more sense then but um 

295.37 295.81 A: yeah 

297.36 298.43 B: yeah i think that 

298.58 300.50 B: it was definitely and even you know 

301.33 303.78 B: looking around you and kind of i mean 

304.20 305.33 B: there's a chance to take 

305.44 310.78 B: stock and i mean i think that i think that's really cliched and i think that it's sad how quickly 

311.34 312.78 B: people have forgotten 

313.55 314.58 B: and how you know 

315.29 315.62 B: there's this 

316.21 317.74 B: it's kind of like a battle cry but it 

318.05 318.70 B: become kind of 

319.18 321.26 B: empty and and everyone's you know 

322.53 323.38 B: quest to like 

323.71 325.83 B: i don't know go buy a new car and that's going to 

325.97 326.81 B: patch everything up 

327.24 327.79 B: i think that 

328.16 330.80 B: that's kind of sad but at the same time i mean i know that 

331.21 333.82 B: you know that day and the days that followed it was just 

334.44 336.66 B: well it is a scary time first of all you know 

337.26 338.02 B: and and 

339.82 341.19 A: yeah and i think it was really 

341.33 344.17 A: like one of the most significant days of my life 

344.00 344.78 B: oh i know 

344.62 346.76 A: and that just you know not just that day and that just 

346.99 354.62 A: you know what happened that day i mean what happened that day has certainly shaped it shaped it but you know just this feeling of you know like disorientation 

354.87 355.29 B: yeah 

354.99 356.08 A: you know this feeling of 

356.94 360.49 A: wow where am i and where do i fit into this and 

358.43 359.20 B: exactly 

360.73 361.97 A: where do we all fit into this 

362.14 362.72 B: mhm 

364.87 366.40 A: you know trying to sort through like the 

368.52 369.21 B: yeah 

370.87 371.43 A: recogni- 

383.80 384.22 B: yeah 

389.69 390.07 B: yeah 

395.85 396.76 A: about what happened 

396.95 397.33 A: though 

396.99 397.32 B: mhm 

397.71 401.45 A: you know we should never forget and we'll never forget you know but why did this happen 

401.76 402.17 B: yeah 

402.26 403.85 A: and i think that's you know like 

404.22 408.40 A: that thought is really like what just gave me this tremendous you know 

408.86 411.19 A: and so like deeply routed feeling of 

419.79 420.33 A: like 

421.42 423.92 A: how is my you know position on everything you know (( )) 

424.92 426.86 A: dramatically changed and defined by the 

425.79 426.39 B: mhm 

429.78 430.04 A: that 

430.64 431.69 A: i think about but i 

431.89 436.38 A: but it's almost like i make a conscious decision you know not to think too much about it you know (( )) 

436.08 436.62 B: yeah 

436.96 437.77 A: just because it's 

437.86 441.06 A: it brings up so many things that are so hard to sort through 

441.04 441.63 B: yeah it 

441.35 443.76 A: you know especially when so much is out of our control 

444.13 445.94 B: it's definitely an overwhelming thing 

446.75 447.26 B: i mean 

449.10 452.87 B: i i remember thinking that day and and then the days that followed that like 

453.58 454.08 B: um 

454.24 455.82 B: you always here i think i guess 

456.06 457.97 B: generation before mine was probably 

458.34 460.36 B: where were you when you heard that kennedy got shot 

461.11 463.01 B: or two generations before that you know 

463.24 468.75 B: where were you when you heard about pearl harbor or whatever and everyone remembers that and i know that you know i can ex- 

468.84 469.79 B: -plicitly remember 

470.71 471.46 B: driving to 

471.58 473.38 B: school and hearing on the radio 

473.68 475.28 B: and i thought it was some sort of like joke 

475.74 477.04 B: like i thought it was you know 

477.73 478.62 B: some sort of 

478.78 479.28 B: fake 

479.55 480.34 B: radio 

480.80 482.42 B: promotion at first and 

481.79 482.40 A: yeah 

482.80 486.74 B: and then walking into school and seeing it on every single television 

487.00 488.29 B: i remember thinking you know 

489.04 495.58 B: so this is going to be you know where were you when september eleventh happened for me and i thought you know well what am i going to tell my children about this 

496.17 497.76 B: and and what's going to happen you know 

498.13 499.51 B: that uncertainty of 

500.61 501.13 B: what 

501.26 505.03 B: what are going to be the repercussions of this long term i mean how are 

505.55 509.18 B: generations to follow going to remember this day and how it changed 

510.45 511.90 B: our nation i think 

511.69 514.11 A: yeah i mean it's interesting to think about 

515.12 516.63 A: the way things have changed 

517.30 517.76 A: uh 

518.52 519.82 A: sense then i mean you can't 

519.93 524.48 A: really open a newspaper or really go anywhere without reading something about 

524.75 526.34 A: without finding the word terrorism 

526.39 527.01 B: mhm 

527.80 530.18 A: simply you know what i mean 

528.77 529.32 B: yeah 

530.48 531.02 A: um 

531.91 534.63 A: and i think you know you're absolutely right about how 

535.54 536.77 A: we'll never really forget 

536.90 538.94 A: you know where we were and what we were doing and 

538.62 539.05 B: mhm 

541.86 544.31 A: yeah it's kind of interesting like you said you know we grew up 

544.49 550.11 A: with hearing about you know how and it was you- you're right it totally became cliche you know how everybody 

550.76 553.28 A: knew and remembered exactly what they were doing you know 

561.31 561.93 A: if i if i 

569.09 569.68 B: yeah 

571.73 573.55 A: that that day for me was just like this
