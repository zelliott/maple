34.62 39.18 A: so we're supposed to be talking about how september eleventh has changed our lives 

39.06 40.51 B: yes 

40.30 42.50 A: how did it ef- affect you in north carolina 

43.62 51.17 B: well i don't know about other north carolinians uh the the effect on me has just been the secondary effect of making air travel 

51.46 51.99 B: a lot 

52.16 53.10 B: less convenient 

53.61 54.08 A: mhm 

53.79 55.15 B: because of security 

55.20 55.71 A: mhm 

56.27 63.28 B: but i don't think it's changed my attitudes i don't walk around with any more or less fear of flying or anything else 

63.07 63.61 A: mhm 

64.19 67.82 A: what about when you're on an airplane 

64.57 65.34 B: um 

67.93 72.23 A: do you pay anymore attention to the other travelers 

73.08 73.63 B: i don't 

73.73 77.71 B: i don't really i i certainly have the 

78.33 83.17 B: you know i go on an airplane with the attitude that if anybody starts messing around you're going to have to 

84.94 85.55 A: uh huh 

97.28 97.83 A: mhm 

97.78 105.31 B: but now i don't think passengers would would ever permit it in fact i don't believe there's been a successful hijacking since 

105.60 106.93 B: september eleventh 

106.77 111.76 A: oh that's true i hadn't thought about that course they didn't happen all that frequently anyway 

113.10 113.71 A: but 

114.75 116.61 A: yeah cause before the 

116.75 117.51 A: the 

117.87 118.88 A: what the prominent 

120.04 123.61 A: thought was that if you cooperate then less people will be killed 

123.54 123.92 B: yeah 

124.28 125.21 A: and let the 

125.84 131.89 A: authorities take care of of the situation but that's certainly not the case anymore 

131.39 131.76 B: yeah 

143.64 144.06 A: plane 

144.35 144.75 B: mhm 

145.03 145.87 A: and their pot- 

146.01 147.53 A: potential i guess 

147.97 149.25 A: for um 

150.86 152.04 A: for causing damage 

152.20 152.58 B: yeah 

153.14 155.69 A: but it has made air travel a lot 

155.84 157.32 A: less convenient 

157.43 158.18 A: that's true 

158.68 161.28 B: yeah it it has in in 

161.50 165.76 B: act- in one sense it has it was another sense i realized because uh 

166.62 172.60 B: uh i do quite a bit of air traveling my wife does a tremendous amount because she's a corporate executive uh 

170.58 170.94 A: mhm 

172.34 172.74 A: mhm 

172.78 174.22 B: an uh uh international 

174.62 175.17 B: corporation 

175.55 180.94 B: it's a lot easy to get flights cause a lot of people for months and months after september eleventh didn't fly 

181.03 181.56 A: uh huh 

181.59 182.49 B: and you just call up 

182.81 186.14 B: a day in advance and you can get a flight that ordinarily you'd have to 

186.28 187.62 B: make reservations 

187.75 189.52 B: weeks or months in advance for 

189.12 190.07 A: oh really 

191.23 192.86 B: so i guess that was a 

194.16 196.74 B: i don't know whether to call that a good thing or not 

196.92 199.84 A: well it certainly was not good for the airline industry 

199.63 200.06 B: no 

200.06 200.98 A: and i think 

201.29 203.62 A: a side effect of that has been 

203.82 208.04 A: the new changes that they've made made for travel um 

208.98 213.63 A: a month ago i was supposed to go down to south carolina to visit a friend 

213.77 216.54 A: and her dad had open heart surgery 

216.74 217.93 A: unexpectedly 

218.10 220.59 A: and so i wanted to change my 

220.82 226.39 A: plans and before i could just call the airline and change my flight now i have to call 

226.54 235.68 A: the day of my departure if i call after midnight on the day of my departure i've lost the ticket totally and it cost me a hundred dollars to make the change the ticket itself was 

235.83 244.03 A: um less than two hundred dollars so i added fifty percent to the price of the ticket just so that i wouldn't lose what i had paid for it 

237.85 238.83 B: ouch 

244.72 246.62 B: was that southwest by any chance 

246.69 249.57 A: no that was uh 

252.84 253.78 A: i don't remember 

254.11 254.99 A: who it was 

254.97 255.30 B: mhm 

257.57 258.19 B: interesting 

258.20 261.58 A: well i don't remember cause i really don't have loyalty to one particular 

261.73 264.41 A: airline it's whoever can get me the cheapest price 

264.46 264.81 B: yeah 

265.40 267.68 B: ha- have you been to new york since uh 

267.92 268.76 A: no 

268.44 269.20 B: nine eleven 

269.56 271.11 A: not not new york city 

271.83 274.48 A: upstate new york yes but not new york city 

272.52 272.96 B: yeah 

275.24 277.50 A: so i haven't visited the site at all 

278.00 279.27 B: yeah i felt like i 

279.50 282.00 B: wanted to see the site and also go there and 

282.80 285.64 B: uh basically go there and spend some money in the city they took 

286.09 288.27 B: they took such a beating and uh 

287.87 288.89 A: that's true 

289.29 290.32 B: so uh 

290.44 295.28 B: my wife and i went up there in october maybe a month or five weeks later 

295.54 296.06 A: oh yeah 

296.55 297.95 B: and it was 

298.69 305.51 B: well let's just say it was an interesting and unique experience to be on that site and see the kinds of things that were going on and uh 

305.19 305.70 A: mhm 

305.88 309.48 B: the kinds of messages people left and the reaction of people and 

310.25 311.68 B: i mean you know it's just something that 

312.63 313.13 B: that 

314.07 317.64 B: most people will read in history books and they'll never have experienced it 

317.80 320.19 A: right yeah it was probably somber there 

321.44 326.20 B: it was pretty somber yeah somber would be exactly the right word 

326.65 327.92 A: i've been to the 

328.73 330.54 A: memorial in oklahoma city 

331.20 331.74 B: mhm 

331.70 336.25 A: for the murrah building and i would imagine that it would be a similar 

336.87 337.66 A: atmosphere 

338.20 339.32 A: at both places 

339.61 341.06 B: yeah how long after that 

341.29 342.59 B: bombing did you go 

342.60 344.13 A: w- let's see 

344.87 348.08 A: it was it was on the anniversary of the bombing 

350.50 354.04 A: i do not remember it was in ninety 

356.07 358.18 A: ninety nine that i went 

359.82 361.44 A: how many years would that have been 

362.14 369.78 B: i you know i i mean i certainly remember the bombing but the date you know it's not affixed to a date in my memory the way nine eleven is 

367.87 368.61 A: yeah 

370.06 373.24 A: well that's how they kept referring to it as september eleventh 

373.38 373.73 B: yeah 

373.99 377.20 A: the the media used that date so often 

374.09 374.40 B: yeah 

377.36 378.66 A: when referring to it 

378.85 379.26 B: yeah 

380.02 380.89 B: i didn't know if i had a 

381.38 388.74 B: kid born if i was a kid born on the date well it's hard to say by the time maybe five or six years from now people won't talk about it that much 

388.24 392.79 A: yeah but the thing too with the oklahoma city bombing it was one event 

393.33 393.66 B: yeah 

393.55 399.65 A: and on september eleventh and one event in one city september eleventh it was new york city and washington d._c. and pennsylvania 

397.78 398.07 B: yeah 

398.57 399.00 B: yeah 

399.58 399.88 B: yeah 

400.47 401.10 A: so 

401.51 404.51 A: you would ha- kind of have to refer to it as the date 

404.83 405.82 B: yeah that's right 

406.35 407.28 A: because of the 

408.12 408.77 A: breadth 

409.13 410.62 A: of what of what they did 

411.10 411.51 B: yeah 

411.24 412.03 A: one thing 

412.24 417.02 A: in maryland we can get into d._c. pretty easily and you certainly see some changes there 

417.95 419.97 A: now after the bombings 

418.06 418.37 B: mhm 

420.10 422.97 A: in africa the terrorist bombings in africa 

422.84 423.27 B: mhm 

423.31 426.09 A: then that's when barriers went up 

426.65 431.83 A: around most of the buildings but after september eleventh even more barriers went up 

428.95 429.30 B: right 

431.74 432.20 B: right 

432.73 435.75 A: around them to try to stop i guess truck bombs 

436.22 436.97 A: things like that 

436.81 441.45 B: yeah are are you in the sort of the d._c. metro part of maryland 

441.43 448.20 A: um i'm between baltimore and maryland so no not really i'm i'm kind of north of that 

448.95 449.80 A: but but 

450.96 453.08 A: the um tours of the white house 

453.80 454.54 A: are totally 

455.00 456.90 A: stopped now except for school groups 

457.78 462.09 A: or before if you were willing to stand in line you could go on a tour of the white house and now 

463.11 463.73 A: you just can't 

463.13 463.55 B: yeah 

464.46 464.77 B: hm 

465.47 469.29 A: that's one thing i i'm not sure about tours of uh 

469.64 470.56 A: congressional 

471.14 473.76 A: buildings or being able to go in and watch congress 

474.51 476.10 A: whether that's changed or not 

477.22 480.66 B: yeah i don't know they certainly i'm sure that to get 

481.23 482.82 B: even close you have to (( )) 

483.69 487.16 B: undergo a pretty uh pretty extensive search 

487.06 487.56 A: mhm 

488.69 489.89 B: i should think yeah 

490.04 494.20 A: yeah getting into other public buildings like the smithsonian museums 

494.91 496.49 A: i think they're still the same 

496.97 501.14 A: although it used to be one guard that was there checking your bags and now they have three or four 

501.11 501.48 B: mhm 

503.94 507.01 A: i don't know whether that's for safety's sake or just because more people are 

507.84 509.41 A: were there when i went 

510.80 513.20 A: but it hasn't really changed my habits at all 

513.34 515.05 A: similar to what you said earlier 

516.80 519.23 B: yeah i certainly think about it but it's uh 

521.97 525.56 B: and it's affected my life in a psychological kind of a way 

525.53 525.98 A: yeah 

527.21 527.75 B: this sort of 

528.59 531.73 B: i mean it does i think it really did change the way everybody looked at 

533.17 535.38 B: at the world or for people who took 

535.83 539.21 B: take the trouble to look at it from an international perspective anyway
