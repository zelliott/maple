57.40 59.95 B: i don't know i mean what about the um 

60.10 62.82 B: i mean the caliber of the people who are doing the checking 

63.52 65.21 A: uh sure that's a factor 

64.55 66.74 B: -cause that doesn't seem like it's improved much 

66.89 67.33 A: no 

67.64 68.72 B: no i mean i get check- 

68.83 69.11 B: for s- 

69.22 70.30 B: -tupid things like 

70.60 73.76 B: you know before they open up my laptop case they have to do all the 

73.89 76.14 B: dustings look for bombs and everything and 

76.79 78.65 B: i don't know they just don't seem 

79.18 80.95 B: like they really care about it all that much 

81.25 81.97 A: no but 

82.30 85.89 A: the dusting probably works better i mean the what they used to do was just turn the 

86.20 88.78 A: tell you to turn the laptop on right do you remember that 

87.94 88.24 B: right 

88.89 90.19 B: yeah i could never figure that out 

88.99 91.10 A: well that doesn't tell you anything right 

90.74 94.70 B: yeah i know like couldn't you make it so it turns on anyway even if there is a bomb inside 

93.23 94.09 A: s- sure 

96.94 104.48 A: yeah i would think so well now the- wo- all there these people are supposed to be government employees now so that should re- really improve the situation right 

105.00 108.80 B: well see that's kind of what scares me -cause i'm thinking about like the post office and 

108.23 109.01 A: mhm 

109.10 110.62 B: it's going to be something like that 

109.98 113.16 A: maybe it'll be actual terrorists in line you know 

112.40 113.27 B: yeah 

113.32 115.32 A: they'll be uh checking your baggage 

115.50 117.22 A: adding things to it or something 

118.07 120.85 B: yeah i'm glad they stopped asking those questions though -cause i don't think that 

121.47 125.27 B: really did anything at all except make me really nervous that i was going to say the wrong thing 

125.43 126.26 A: which questions 

126.47 129.60 B: you know the ones where they used to ask you have you packed all of your bags personally 

129.93 132.44 B: have you bags been with you at all times until you've 

132.02 133.39 A: have they stopped doin- that 

133.19 134.19 B: yeah they stopped doing it 

134.28 135.80 A: i hadn't really noticed that 

136.37 138.29 A: actually i haven't flown in 

138.89 141.31 A: flown in probably about six months so 

142.08 144.33 A: but yeah it's always irritating -cause you know you haven't 

144.54 145.67 A: really had your 

146.13 152.62 A: bags completely under you eye since you packed them you know but you have to say yes otherwise you don't get on the plane so 

148.58 149.16 B: yeah 

152.42 160.17 B: i know you don't want to say well you know my boyfriend was holding them for ten minutes while i went to the bathroom and then they say oh sorry you can't get on the plane 

160.87 162.10 A: yeah right 

163.28 164.49 A: uh 

164.58 169.31 B: so what are they checking for here are they checking for our speech patterns and how we talk to strangers and things like that 

169.78 170.50 A: um 

169.78 170.99 B: i think that's what i read 

171.31 172.41 A: yeah i think so 

173.02 174.57 B: that be really interesting to find out about it 

175.28 176.81 A: yeah tha- they should 

177.23 180.92 A: i i'm sure we could look on the web on their web page somewhere figure it out 

181.53 183.92 A: or at least get some information 

184.21 188.67 A: and i think one of the people actually i work with is somehow involved with the group that is doing the study so 

189.00 190.07 A: that's how i heard about it 

189.11 189.71 B: yeah we have a 

190.52 194.89 B: woman here who's doing all the language studies and she passed the email around that's how we all got it 

194.93 196.36 A: yeah so you're a student there 

196.49 198.21 B: yeah i'm a grad student 

197.97 199.48 A: okay what's your what do you 

199.55 200.71 B: i'm in engineering psych 

199.72 199.99 A: -udy 

201.09 203.05 B: so i'm in human factor psychology 

203.29 205.26 B: you probably know about that if you're in the army 

205.51 206.69 A: yeah i do- 

206.83 208.60 A: uh i don't work in that area 

208.73 208.98 A: but 

209.15 210.13 A: that's right we have a 

210.45 211.94 A: a laboratory that's uh 

212.78 213.31 A: focused 

213.47 215.58 A: pretty much exclusively on that kind of stuff 

216.28 220.13 B: yeah i really like it -cause you get to feel like you're making a difference in the world you know you're 

220.86 223.46 B: ba- making things easier to use you're designing them to be 

223.90 226.72 B: hopefully safer and more intuitive and things like that 

227.02 227.55 A: mhm 

227.63 230.59 B: or at least being able to tell people that they're not safe you know 

230.67 235.32 A: sa- so what's the background for that anyway you said it's engineering psych right it that what you said 

235.39 235.94 B: yeah 

236.13 239.54 B: so usually people ask me you know does that mean you counsel engineers 

239.03 242.70 A: you wouldn't want to have to do that 

239.99 243.09 B: oh my god no god no 

243.75 248.45 B: no um but -ell my background's in psychology and english of all things but 

248.79 252.50 B: most people have a background in like human computer interaction or 

252.81 253.31 A: mhm 

253.25 254.46 B: something to do with computers 

254.63 255.38 B: stuff like that 

255.33 257.90 A: yeah so you're a master's student or you're working on a p._h._d. 

257.10 260.29 B: well i'm finishing up my master's and then uh my p._h._d. will come after that 

260.77 262.07 B: but i'm still in the 

262.21 264.87 B: i'm s- i'm in the p._h._d. program but i'm finishing up my masters 

265.23 265.66 A: good 

265.79 266.06 B: first 

266.93 268.73 A: yeah that's right uh-huh 

268.50 270.37 B: what about you is it a job or are you a student 

270.17 273.41 A: yeah this is a job yeah for me i i work in um 

273.73 274.47 A: robotics 

274.59 275.18 A: basically 

274.81 275.50 B: oh cool 

276.91 280.35 A: um and computer vision which a- actually i know i don't know well you probably don't know 

280.11 284.19 B: you know that's really interesting because i'm working on a computer vision project right now 

284.14 284.66 A: oh yeah 

284.68 285.19 B: yeah 

285.41 285.83 A: what's that 

285.73 287.35 B: with the um college of computing 

287.72 289.26 B: we're doing error recognition 

289.52 295.55 B: so for us it's really interesting to know how a you know a computer can help train you to do something like use a a machine 

296.34 299.23 B: but for them it's interesting the question is you know how do you 

299.63 301.70 B: get the computer to recognize what the person's doing 

302.38 306.58 B: so we're developing all the feedback and trying to figure out what's the best way to tell people to do things 

307.03 312.07 B: and they're trying to figure out well how can we watch people's hands and th- and see what they're doing with the machines 

312.04 314.91 A: okay what kind of uh activities are they doing anyway 

314.67 316.75 B: well we're starting off with a blood glucose meter 

317.06 317.47 A: a what 

317.54 321.13 B: a blood glucose meter it's something that people with diabetes use to check their blood 

318.89 319.71 A: mhm 

321.33 321.79 A: okay 

321.67 325.62 B: and we've done a lot of studies before where it turns out it's really hard to train someone to use one 

326.19 326.57 A: uh-huh 

326.37 326.92 B: so 

327.03 328.42 B: they're trying to use i don't know 

328.70 330.82 B: lob recognition or something like that to 

330.97 333.03 B: see what peoples hands are doing with the meter 

333.27 333.69 A: right 

333.82 336.15 B: and that way they can get feedback whenever we say 

336.28 339.42 B: you know well if someone makes this mistake then they need to be told 

339.84 344.41 B: this particular instruction to give them a better mental model of how the machine is working 

344.38 344.85 A: sure 

346.04 347.67 A: yeah that so- sounds real interesting 

348.25 348.84 A: they uh 

349.01 352.27 A: i used to work with a guy his name was aaron bobick he's no- he was a 

351.80 352.82 B: yeah yeah he's here 

352.36 352.62 A: you k- 

353.13 353.74 A: you know him huh 

353.65 355.75 B: yeah well i don't really know him but i certainly hear the name a lot 

355.80 356.19 A: okay 

356.75 364.66 A: yeah he was at m._i._t. for awhile that's when i worked with him and then i know he went down there we also did a lot of graphic stuff with georgia tech with uh 

365.72 370.34 A: huh uh although i wasn't really involved with that one of the people's names was rubarski i think 

370.64 370.98 A: anyway 

370.86 371.87 B: bill rubarski 

371.27 373.40 A: three or four professors there yeah they have 

374.15 375.04 A: it's like um 

375.25 378.56 A: virtual reality things that they do yeah so 

378.79 381.38 A: uh some of it's three d. some of it's 

381.48 384.08 A: geographic information systems and things like that 

385.39 390.40 A: are we supposed pa- are they supposed to tell us when to stop talking or do we have to talk for like hours 

388.23 389.29 B: i think so 

389.53 395.40 B: i know well it said two to three minutes on the the thing i thought but it's been longer than that 

395.26 400.99 A: yeah i haven't read that for awhile so i've kind of forgotten what the whole i was surprised to actually get a call 

400.66 402.01 B: this is my first call yeah 

402.10 403.40 A: mine too yeah 

403.74 407.48 A: they probably just started i w- that must be pretty interesting i wonder you know 

407.66 412.77 A: probably like us most people will stay on the topic you know for a short period of time and then 

413.08 416.74 A: move off into other things so i wonder if that's something they're studying or uh 

416.69 421.74 B: yeah i don't know i bet the topic is some sort of ice breaker you know because they want to get our speech patterns and how we're 

422.29 424.28 B: you know talking to each other and how we 

424.46 425.00 B: i don't know 

425.32 425.76 A: mhm 

425.37 426.68 B: pause and things like that 

427.14 428.14 B: and so i'm guessing that 

428.31 429.18 B: you know that's just to make us 

429.88 435.82 B: start talking and then they start analyzing how many times i say like and and you know and things like that 

435.52 435.96 A: yeah 

437.15 437.85 A: did you uh 

438.46 439.87 A: did you have to wait for very long 

440.06 441.30 B: no i waited for maybe 

440.11 440.43 A: for 

441.95 442.70 B: thirty seconds 

442.81 444.45 B: listening to music and then you popped on 

445.02 445.83 A: okay -cause it 

446.53 449.32 A: -cause i you know it came on the robot came on and 

450.10 451.73 A: i had forgotten that i needed a pin 

452.38 453.13 A: and so 

453.39 456.28 A: i don't know i think i was looking around for my pin on my email for about 

456.45 459.41 A: five six minutes before i ever f- found it so 

459.52 459.97 A: and then 

460.22 461.06 A: but they may be 

461.80 463.99 A: may be sort of a random selection of uh 

464.30 465.19 A: connections 

465.78 466.80 B: yeah i bet if they just 

465.93 469.05 A: you know they maybe calling like hundreds of people and then whoever happens to c- 

469.48 470.38 B: right 

469.55 472.34 A: you know come up at the right time they connect you to i mean i don't know 

472.14 477.09 B: and i was wondering i was under the impression that there might be more than two people sometimes you know where you might be talking to 

477.63 478.53 B: two or three people 

478.52 479.49 A: yeah i think they did 

480.04 481.32 A: i i seem to remember 

482.26 483.91 A: under some cases that might happen 

484.29 486.35 A: d- you sign up for the advanced uh 

486.50 487.18 A: one if they 

487.29 490.60 B: i said yeah sure if you want to i could use some christmas money you know 

490.32 490.82 A: eh ha 

490.92 495.35 B: talking on the phone you know usually you have to run a nine hundred number to get money that way so 

494.97 496.67 A: yeah right 

497.54 498.52 A: so um 

500.05 501.37 A: wow so you have about 

501.61 503.39 A: two or three years left to go i guess huh 

502.97 503.35 B: yeah 

504.15 504.91 A: are you from 

505.33 506.27 A: georgia then or 

505.99 506.91 B: i'm from alabama 

507.43 508.08 B: actually 

507.64 507.97 A: how lo- 

508.17 509.21 A: it doesn't sound like you have an a- 

508.91 511.71 B: no that's what everybody says well a- i worked in um 

511.86 515.68 B: seattle for awhile at a cancer research center before i came back to grad school 

516.10 516.39 A: huh 

516.43 516.98 B: and 

517.08 518.87 B: i was going to work as an interviewer 

519.23 522.86 B: and um i you know i just sent in my resume and they said it looked good or whatever 

523.35 529.61 B: but then they said they were really nervous about hiring me -cause they were afraid no one was going to be able to uner- understand me -cause i was from alabama 

529.62 531.42 A: they didn't listen to you though huh they just 

530.79 537.34 B: no they hadn't talked to me yet and they just you know knew that i was from alabama and that i had been to school in texas and they thought oh god you know 

537.41 538.99 A: oh texas (( ain't )) alabama 

537.46 539.42 B: nobody's going to be able to understand her 

540.16 541.06 A: that's nonsense 

542.27 543.10 B: yeah what about you 

543.92 544.53 A: uh ac- 

544.04 544.97 B: where did you go to school 

544.63 546.43 A: actually i'm on e- where did i go to school 

546.43 546.96 B: yeah 

546.96 552.32 A: uh i have an undergraduate degree from university of maryland many years ago and uh 

551.64 552.19 B: mhm 

552.56 555.47 A: then i have a master's degree from john's hopkins in computer science 

556.77 558.31 A: yeah but that was also 

559.27 560.00 A: ten years ago 

561.99 563.58 A: so i've just been working since then
