0.09 1.76 A: hi i'm carrie 

1.39 2.96 B: hello i'm alina 

3.34 4.71 A: hi um 

6.06 11.18 A: that's september eleventh i guess i've been um um more 

11.23 19.80 A: um keeping in touch with my family and stuff like that that really made me 'cause i don't like um close to home so it really made me think about [sigh] 

14.45 15.30 B: yeah 

19.91 23.18 A: you know everything that could have happened had i lived at home 

23.00 23.95 B: yeah 

23.96 25.21 A: how 'bout for you 

25.44 26.34 B: well [lipsmack] 

26.62 37.21 B: i'm not from the states but i was i was actually in canada when it happened and we couldn't get back into the states for a while and so there was a very immediate concern right there and you know you sort of felt 

30.31 31.33 A: oh wow 

32.81 33.85 A: (( [lipsmack] oh yeah )) 

37.37 43.09 B: at a distance we were in toronto which is not so far geographically speaking but you know we're in a different country so 

43.57 49.79 B: [lipsmack] and then as a foreigner in the u._s. it's also made a big difference because things have been tightened a lot for us 

49.51 51.06 A: [lipsmack] oh absolutely 

50.48 55.00 B: so you know i have to report now to the i._n._s. if i ever move and you know you you 

55.02 63.50 B: feel more vulnerable which i mean i think it's a good thing because if you were here for legitimate reasons as i am then there's no problem with being 

63.62 65.47 B: providing this information 

65.27 66.32 A: (( right [lipsmack] )) 

65.70 72.60 B: and it's the only way or it's one way to to try and keep better tabs on people that come into the country so 

72.77 77.85 B: [lipsmack] but it's it would be in that category i mean somehow i'm sort of in the category of foreigners that 

77.86 79.39 B: could be bad people 

79.45 93.60 A: oh do you i mean have you ever have you ha- um sensed any repercussions since the eleventh like have you had any um any uh hate acts towards you or do you see notice anybody like looking at you differently or anything like that okay 

79.57 80.30 B: (( so [laughter] )) 

91.74 100.63 B: no i mean i'm i'm white i'm from i'm from northern europe so no other country yeah but i have friends from uh some of the arab world and 

95.27 96.49 A: (( oh okay )) 

99.94 100.86 A: uh-huh 

100.71 113.28 B: even though i mean we're sort of in higher education all of us and people are in general very tolerant but there's small things like i remember i went to the post office to buy some stamps and i didn't want the ones with the flag on it because i didn't feel prepared to sort of 

113.27 116.84 B: send that out as the message and and i remember 

114.30 115.25 A: right 

117.15 125.75 B: the i sailed a little thing there and this was right after which which made it even more sensitive like sort of well if you don't want it why are you here 

125.96 127.38 B: it's only thing 

125.97 130.87 A: [lipsmack] really wow yeah i wouldn't even think of som- something like that but 

128.02 128.69 B: but 

130.53 132.66 B: i can see how it's difficult because 

132.67 137.45 B: if you're not a citizen which i'm not then it's harder to criticize 

137.50 138.49 A: right 

137.75 139.34 B: because it's like you're not 

139.74 148.42 B: a contributing member i mean i do pay taxes but you know i'm not a citizen i don't have rights i don't have representatives and so i tried to keep myself informed but i can't really 

148.68 152.37 B: i could i mean i guess i can express myself but i don't have 

152.38 161.42 B: it's it's i feel more uneasy than i do about it in denmark i mean in denmark i can vote and so on and and i feel confident doing that but not here yeah 

154.87 155.78 A: right 

158.02 158.97 A: yeah 

160.99 162.27 A: wow 

161.84 167.06 B: so it made me think about that that i would like to live in a country where i can be a citizen some day yeah [laughter] 

166.81 169.74 A: where are wh- what are you a citizen of i'm sorry 

169.36 170.61 B: um denmark 

170.44 171.63 A: oh okay 

171.09 175.09 B: yeah so a very small country so even though i can vote there it doesn't feel so 

175.21 186.38 B: important because i'm so far away from it and you know the it's i mean if you live in denmark what happens in the u._s. matters if you live in the u._s. what happens in denmark doesn't really matter because of the scale right 

177.58 178.62 A: right 

185.72 186.96 A: huh 

186.61 189.55 B: so every- everybody suspected that would happen 

189.39 190.73 A: yeah 

189.66 194.82 B: september eleventh you know of course my family was actually visiting here in the states they were in los angeles 

193.58 194.84 A: oh they were 

194.94 202.54 B: yeah they were also i mean i was in toronto and they were in los angeles and [laughter] we were trying to get together so [laughter] and it worked out it worked out yeah 

199.60 200.82 A: oh wow 

201.86 203.20 A: (( oh that's good wow )) 

202.58 206.35 B: so i'm glad they didn't cancel they got here on the ninth i think 

206.50 217.07 B: and so they were very confused what to do because you know nobody knew whether to go ahead with the trip and so on but they did in the end and they had a good trip they were on the west coast all the time so 

209.81 210.93 A: oh yeah 

216.48 217.68 A: wow 

217.17 219.65 B: it didn't feel so close to it 

219.51 229.19 A: yeah actually um i'm in the military and um in in that's why i'm not at home i'm actually from the east coast and um 

222.42 223.12 B: (( yes )) 

227.64 228.46 B: yeah 

230.13 243.34 A: it i mean it really made me think oh my gosh you know i could've you know i have friends or family that live there i i don't know it was just very and now i have you know many friends that are deployed 

237.94 238.86 B: yeah 

239.77 240.52 B: yeah 

243.07 243.94 B: yes 

243.33 246.76 A: um and just to tighten security and just 

246.65 259.62 A: i i guess i was completely taken aback um some of my friends in the military said oh you know we definitely know you know that this is you know terrorist i i that was like the last thing on my mind i saw it happen on t._v. 

259.38 260.18 B: right 

259.77 262.47 A: and that was the last thing on my mind i thought 

261.51 262.29 B: yeah 

262.53 265.57 A: that you know [lipsmack] it was nothing like that 

264.93 266.95 B: it's interesting because that day 

267.01 275.00 B: when i was in toronto to stay with my partner because he's from there and my friend from when i lived in edinburgh was flying in to visit and he's originally from pakistan 

274.96 287.88 B: and she arrived that day and she was one of the last i mean apparently her flight she came from london i think was too far gone to recall it and so first they were told they would could maybe go down in montreal but then they were eventually allowed to land in toronto 

274.97 275.81 A: oh 

281.72 282.65 A: yes 

287.82 301.36 B: and so we were there to pick her up and they had only been told on the flight that something had happened in the states which is of course is very unsettling thing to be told but just since she got off the plane she was just asking us what has happened you know and 

300.76 303.38 A: oh i can't even imagine being on a plane 

302.59 313.99 B: [sigh] yeah until it i guess it's why they didn't tell them but they had to tell them something because they were making changing plans all the time about whether they were turning back or going to montreal or going to toronto so all the passengers knew that something was up 

309.76 310.85 A: (( mm )) 

314.12 314.96 A: (( wow )) 

314.18 319.03 B: plus when they got to the airport there was hardly any people there and it's a big airport so it was kinda strange 

318.46 319.98 A: oh yeah 

319.33 322.23 B: but i remember we went back and ha- and had dinner and you know 

322.59 327.69 B: very shortly she said because you know being from pakistan she knows the politics of that area and she said 

327.68 337.82 B: this is she said osama bin laden this is what's gonna happen this is what the you know first hypothesis is going to be and this is what pakistan's role is gonna be in it 

337.88 343.76 B: and i remember thinking hey wait a minute let's see what happens but she was right on about all of it 

338.01 338.66 A: (( mm )) 

342.40 343.55 A: mhm 

343.96 348.08 B: so that was very strange thing because sh- i mean 

348.11 351.14 B: she comes from a very different background and she knows the whole 

351.23 354.52 B: ties between pakistan and saudi arabia 

353.75 354.67 A: (( yeah )) 

354.59 365.11 B: moslem link and everything and even though she's i mean she's lived all her life in in scotland but she has that insight into it and she made a very clear analysis on the first day 

362.31 363.15 A: wow 

365.10 366.29 A: wow 

365.47 366.17 B: (( so )) 

366.42 373.10 B: i mean she was she was certainly shocked by what had happened but somehow you know she also had this sort of i guess political 

366.43 367.37 A: and 

372.81 379.63 A: oh that's and same with and some of same with some of my peers i mean they knew instantly and i 

373.59 374.26 B: (( yeah )) 

376.10 377.00 B: yeah 

379.63 389.90 A: um and i actually deal with um aircraft in a certain way and i just thought you know it was a mistake in that an aircraft control measure i don't know it was just a very very odd 

389.65 390.76 B: yeah 

391.54 395.68 B: yeah who alerted you to it were you actually watching t._v. when it came on 

393.83 403.20 A: i was actually watching t._v. and saw the airplanes hit both of them and still i continued on my day because i thought it was um 

403.35 408.86 A: [lipsmack] i thought it was a mistake like an air- air- airspace control measures like there're certain um 

407.27 407.99 B: right 

408.95 422.54 A: pathways that you must follow and certain heights and i thought that somebody misread them put them in the planes wrong and they were flying at too low of an altitude and it wasn't until um the pentagon got hit and then of course it was like oh my gosh 

411.48 412.24 B: yeah 

414.11 414.80 B: yeah 

414.81 415.55 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

422.17 422.91 B: right 

422.61 423.93 A: you know pure pani- 

423.20 429.99 B: right that was very different for us because we were told kind of in the country we were told somebody's attacking new york i think that was how it was put to us 

429.16 430.53 A: wow 

430.13 439.73 B: i was sitting on the computer it was crazy i was doing i mean i'm in academia and i was doing something to do with a conference you know submitting an aspect or something totally abstract from everything else and 

436.10 437.32 A: mhm 

439.04 440.41 A: mhm 

439.60 447.01 B: the people we were staying with come up and said you know bad stuff is happening in new york they're they're attacking new york and you know we rushed downstairs to the t._v. 

447.37 453.12 B: [lipsmack] so i definitely came into it with that feeling that that it was a malicious attack yeah 

452.31 461.40 A: [lipsmack] wow see yeah how 'bout is there anything else besides um having a more stricter control um i guess is it are you on a visa are you on work visa is that 

460.77 467.77 B: i'm on a student visa so it hasn't affected that i mean it could affect my chance of staying here it's not clear yet and there's been some 

465.69 466.48 A: ah 

467.74 482.15 B: i'm in california and uh one of our senators proposed a kind of tracking system for us but it hasn't been approved and i don't think there's much i mean likelihood of that but it's kind of a way of tracking us you know you have to report every so often and so on i mean it 

471.87 472.77 A: uh-huh 

476.94 477.89 A: huh 

479.62 480.75 A: right 

482.44 484.34 B: it made me of course think about 

484.65 485.60 B: (( [lipsmack] i mean )) 

485.66 500.52 B: it is kind of easy to get into the united states that's true i mean if you get accepted to a school all the paperwork runs smoothly and you know when i come int- if i go away and i come back into the country i present my paperwork from the school and it it's fine 

488.82 489.87 A: mhm 

490.54 491.31 A: yeah 

500.29 501.13 A: right 

500.83 513.11 B: but uh but as i said i mean you know being white and being sort of looking middle class i never have any problems but i think a lot of it i mean there's that kind of profiling that i think is even worse now based on how you look 

512.92 520.79 A: well actually and it's funny that you say that because and i i certain- i'm i'm absolutely certain that there is profiling going on 

520.19 521.00 B: yeah 

520.63 528.07 A: and to tell you the truth a week after it happened i was very nervous and but every time i go to the airport and i am a 

528.20 542.61 A: female i'm a caucasian female in the military i always present my military i._d. i always get searched always so i don't know if they're necessarily doing profiling as far as like the passengers that get on the planes 

530.15 530.82 B: yeah 

533.32 534.09 B: right 

535.98 536.56 B: (( [cough] )) 

539.06 540.07 B: (( no yeah )) 

542.68 547.09 A: um but yeah i do i do think that people um definitely are looking 

547.59 555.15 B: one of the few sort of positive things i remember or you know uplifting things was you know how everybody else the chaos that there was afterwards like 

555.20 558.72 B: [mn] you know how flights were cancelled for getting back into the states and you have to 

558.63 571.07 B: they did these emergency things because the airline we were flying with didn't have an office in toronto i think so they set it up at some hotel and you just had to go and line up and we were there for hours and hours for us and there was no it wasn't clear when 

567.94 568.71 A: (( mm )) 

571.32 574.29 B: we were gonna get to talk to anybody but people were just 

574.66 581.09 B: so respectful and you just waited in line and i think they gave us some donuts or something you know but this amazing 

581.23 588.75 B: [lipsmack] respectfulness and politeness and you know letting people that were there with kids or elderly people go in front and everybody had this 

589.45 601.32 B: [sigh] it just felt exactly it just came out in a way that you know particularly in airports you don't see it and people waiting in line they go through the worst thing is to try and you know jump the line or something and 

590.29 591.72 A: humanity 

596.14 597.48 A: yeah 

600.50 601.49 A: absolutely 

601.47 608.56 B: that felt kind of special in the middle of it i think it's gone now i haven't flown much since then but [laughter] i think it's probably gone now 

608.18 619.20 A: isn't that what they were saying about in the streets of new york also before and my sister used to live there so when i would visit n- you couldn't look at anybody in the eye you never spoke to anybody you didn't know 

614.23 615.00 B: yeah 

618.13 619.41 B: right right 

619.17 627.68 A: but that you know month or definitely the days following it everybody was talking to everybody else everybody was helping somebody else 

623.53 624.22 B: (( yeah )) 

625.35 626.20 B: yeah 

627.23 636.16 B: yeah when something big happens yeah it's i actually did i went to new york for the first time in october two thousand and one so that was very weird 

635.89 637.04 A: (( oh wow )) 

636.58 643.09 B: in a way it wasn't i was going for a conference and it had been planned for a long time and the conference organizers decided to go ahead with it on that 

643.44 650.67 B: i forget whether it was the mayor that came out and said you know try and do business as usual don't cancel things try and keep things going and so they did and 

646.52 647.64 A: (( yeah )) 

651.41 664.92 B: [mn] since i never had been to new york before i didn't have anything to compare with but my my colleague that i went with actually lived there 'cause he went to n._y._u. and so he was sort of feeling that things were different whereas i wasn't really so you know 

654.63 655.53 A: uh 

664.01 664.89 A: right 

665.01 665.86 B: and 

665.91 669.96 B: that my family was very worried about me going there you know that 

668.85 670.46 A: i can only imagine 

670.69 672.67 B: yeah but i just 

672.79 675.06 B: i didn't feel scared of going there 

675.16 687.43 B: and i fe- you know i guess in that sort of you know try and make things happen don't don't let new york down or don't withdraw or whatever you know whatever little thing you can do to make things go back to normal but 

686.82 687.81 A: mhm 

687.65 688.54 B: yeah 

688.63 698.09 B: [mn] so i think we did all the normal things like he showed me the part of the city that he knew and liked the best and we went to the theatre and went to central park and all those 

698.13 705.70 B: all those things and i guess n._y._u. is close to th- it's in the village so it's you know it's on fourth street or something 

705.05 706.01 A: uh-huh 

705.84 706.74 B: so 

707.22 709.28 B: we were down there but didn't 

709.50 714.12 B: i didn't see or feel anything directly from it like any smell or anything like that 

714.05 715.25 A: wow 

714.65 716.35 B: have you been back there since 

715.91 719.89 A: [lipsmack] i have not actually um i was thinking about going back on new year
