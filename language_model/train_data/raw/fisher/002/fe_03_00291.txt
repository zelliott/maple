31.34 32.27 A: yeah 

33.79 40.20 A: well we do speech recognition here um i'm in their communications ah group and um 

35.87 37.03 B: (( uh )) 

40.24 42.23 A: they ah they built 

42.63 56.87 A: um mainframe based telephone answering systems for telephone companies and you know so part of that these days is speech recognition so yeah we got hooked up with ah with the um 

48.56 49.64 B: (( huh )) 

57.41 58.37 A: (( um with )) 

58.40 70.09 A: linguistic ah consortium l._d._c. ah you know in in getting um for ah you know for testing speech recognition engines and stuff like that 

60.20 61.56 B: the l._d._c. 

69.51 70.48 B: neat 

70.17 72.74 A: so now we're making 'em [laughter] that's cool 

71.52 73.61 B: so you're making what 

73.08 76.19 A: well what now you and i are creating that database 

74.48 83.01 B: oh exactly oh so you guys are creating the stuff that allows me to say i want the number for joe's pizzeria 

76.23 77.37 A: yeah that's cool 

83.06 85.38 B: and a computer can listen to that 

84.83 87.33 A: right or if you if you ah 

87.44 92.71 A: logon to american airlines i think they have ah a voice based um 

92.97 96.15 A: system for getting information on flights 

96.03 97.23 B: on the web 

97.39 98.86 A: oh no not on the web 

98.02 100.77 B: oh just if you call right so

104.37 106.77 A: right yeah 

104.89 106.00 B: oh cool 

106.08 110.69 B: oh that's neat i i hadn't ever thought of there being an overlap between 

111.15 114.39 B: ah the linguistic people and the computer people but of course there are 

113.99 116.68 A: oh yeah in fact microsoft has a ah 

116.78 124.56 A: has a speech based browser for you can you can download a plug in to your browser and you can write um 

125.00 132.44 A: you can write x._m._l. that has speech recognition ah tags in it so you know once you have this 

130.17 131.19 B: wow 

132.59 144.52 A: e- free plug in for your browser it loads a speech recognition engine and a um text to speech engine on your on your p._c. which you can see in your ah you know you configure it in your um 

134.83 135.74 B: (( uh huh )) 

140.54 141.50 B: (( uh huh )) 

144.56 146.11 A: [mn] ah control panel 

146.35 149.88 A: and it loads a ah it installs a um 

149.92 150.80 A: (( ah )) 

150.83 163.17 A: a whatever you need to recognize these new speech recognition tags where you know it'll be a voice x._m._l. tag instead of displaying something in a certain font it says here say this to the user and it comes out over your speakers and then you say now 

162.98 165.65 A: let the user say one of these things and then 

165.43 179.16 A: when you say that if you have a microphone that goes to your sound card and tries to listen to the microphone you know if it hears you say one of those things it'll trigger that then then you go display on a web page or you know go go do some function 

167.47 168.14 B: (( [noise] )) 

177.29 179.25 B: that's really cool 

179.01 180.49 A: so it's neat 

180.24 185.11 B: how far a- away are we from an era without keyboards 

184.93 188.36 A: i think we'll always have keyboards yeah yeah 

185.22 187.04 B: i mean we'll always have them but 

187.31 191.05 B: but in terms of we won't really need them as much 

191.14 192.27 B: (( ah )) 

192.38 197.47 A: well well um i think where it's really going to take off is is in um the handheld devices 

197.22 198.34 B: oh right 

197.52 200.01 A: where it's really a nuisance to use a keyboard you 

200.10 214.29 A: know you know a mouse is pretty easy to use and speech recognition always has the problem of you know if somebody's in your office talking or something like that there's background noise that kind of thing so you know if you really want to ah really want to definitely you know 

202.50 203.46 B: mhm 

209.52 210.57 B: right 

214.18 221.39 A: tell your computer do this pointing and clicking is easier but but with a handheld device if you want to enter then you know 

215.74 216.70 B: mhm 

221.77 228.10 A: enter the name boston as your destination you know and ah it'd be a lot faster to speak it if ah 

224.47 225.44 B: right 

228.12 230.47 A: if you're in the right environment to do that 

229.91 231.47 B: that's intriguing i 

231.74 243.60 B: most of the technology stuff i i don't keep up with that much just cause i i find it's hard to keep up with as as a layperson and i'm i'm annoyed by it when it changes 

238.95 240.07 A: yeah it is 

243.09 244.12 A: yeah 

243.53 256.98 B: ah for change's sake rather than for everybody's convenience and you know i just upgraded my computer system ah and it d- you know performs marginally better but mostly it's just different 

247.66 248.52 A: yeah 

256.84 266.33 A: it's a hassle um upgrading i mean man it seems like everytime you upgrade your computer something breaks something doesn't work that used to work [mn] 

257.09 257.65 B: (( [mn] )) 

263.64 265.19 B: (( yeah )) 

266.03 268.46 B: yeah or you have to upgrade something else 

268.01 275.11 A: well what i've learned at least from my home computer is you know don't ever upgrade the operating system whatever it came with is what it'll work best with 

274.67 275.97 B: right 

275.33 286.81 A: and when you upgrade you'll always you know you'll lose a few some functionality and it'll always run slower and that kind of thing so you know i try to just live as long as i can with what it came with you know 

280.35 281.46 B: mhm 

286.41 287.56 B: right 

286.99 289.16 A: and not mess around with that 

288.44 299.41 B: yeah no i i have a computer i've had since nineteen ninety four and i just upgraded it to um mac o. s. nine one which is still you know two generations back 

296.60 297.51 A: mhm 

299.27 305.84 B: um but i i resent the idea of having to replace the whole thing which i'm going to have to do at some point soon 

305.91 307.11 B: (( ah )) 

307.23 310.43 B: just cause every you know the world is is traveling too fast 

309.90 311.10 A: yeah 

310.46 311.60 B: (( but ah )) 

311.19 321.39 A: yeah my both my son and my daughter ah are mac fans um my um my daughter's in ah she- she's in new york she's ah at pride institute 

314.68 315.59 B: (( uh huh )) 

320.80 321.71 B: (( uh huh )) 

321.50 323.13 A: do you know that you know it 

322.53 323.74 B: yeah i yeah sure 

323.46 333.52 A: and ah so she's there she's in architecture so she uses a lot of drawing and graphic stuff and then and my son is ah he's interested in um 

325.16 326.01 B: (( uh )) 

329.32 330.29 B: (( huh )) 

333.55 338.60 A: you know video production and that kind of stuff so he got [mn] they have 

334.86 336.65 B: (( mm right )) 

338.59 349.59 A: terrific mac tools for that you know for for moviemaker and you know taking video clips and editing them and special effects and you know 

347.02 347.93 B: mhm 

349.65 352.63 A: mixing and matching and merging all the all this 

349.77 350.79 B: right 

351.51 358.40 B: and mac is is particularly good for that kind of stuff i'm surprised about you your daughter though because i have architects 

354.34 355.40 A: yeah 

358.48 362.85 B: who are ah friends and they work entirely in p._c. just because 

362.03 372.82 A: cause of autocad yeah well there's a couple of um you know of mac ah drawing programs too but y- you're right you're right there is there's you know 

363.03 364.04 B: yeah 

373.12 383.24 A: the- there's two camps of of architecture people [mn] if you get you know if you work in a in an office where they've they've got the mac you know the mac suite then you know whatever it's called i don't know 

381.10 382.12 B: right 

382.96 383.52 B: (( [mn] )) 

383.20 392.38 A: then uh they're in good shape but but she likes the mac a lot better she uses a she's also taken some photography courses you know and sh- you know they 

389.62 390.62 B: (( uh huh )) 

392.52 403.82 A: photography these days you know they they still have the wet labs and they do all the work in there but they also digitize it and mess around with it and and do a lot of sp- you know effects on the computer too 

395.41 396.16 B: uh 

399.25 400.21 B: (( huh )) 

403.54 404.54 B: right 

403.93 406.54 A: and ah you know they um 

406.60 409.09 A: they she she prefers a mac for that 

408.39 417.23 B: yeah now we we haven't spoken one word about the topic that was suggested well let me ask since you're the computer guy um 

412.43 414.19 A: oh shame on us 

417.30 422.11 B: i i assume that it doesn't actually matter that the the topics are 

422.04 432.91 B: are nice to have but they're really just to direct conversation and that the aim of this study is to create a database of or a volume of words 

427.38 428.25 A: yeah 

430.93 431.85 A: right 

432.34 433.85 A: right i think so too 

432.85 439.18 B: so so that we could be as long as they're english and they're complete sentences or incomplete sentences 

436.44 437.27 A: yeah 

437.78 441.04 A: so some poor sap's got to sit down and translate this 

441.23 446.60 B: well well are they or are they going to use a computer to do it is is 

441.47 443.48 A: yeah or transcribe this 

445.91 456.69 A: um well you know you can use a computer to do it but but then it's going be only as accurate as the computer is your then then your database is corrupted and your you're telling 

452.38 454.64 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

457.00 462.58 A: another computer hey when you hear this it means whatever the computer thought it meant the first time it heard it so 

461.82 463.04 B: (( [laughter] )) 

462.43 470.13 A: no they really no i think the databases are are hand transcribed and th- then they become the masters for for new work 

466.52 467.52 B: wow 

469.49 470.56 B: right 

469.92 477.49 A: you know so it's got to be correct if it's got bugs in it or you know then then then it's it's you're just counterproductive so yeah because 

472.47 473.45 B: right 

476.61 486.99 B: so this this is how mistakes get institutionalized right they use the computer to analyze our speech and then the b- for the purpose of using computers to analyze speech [laughter] 

479.43 480.28 A: right 

485.25 486.19 A: yeah 

486.56 492.42 A: so uh so saying hello to the person who's transcribing this [laughter] 

490.64 496.32 B: [laughter] well it would make his day a little more interesting to know that he's not ah 

496.33 499.04 B: working you know like the wizard of oz he's not 

498.46 500.84 A: i wonder what they're getting paid to do that 

500.23 501.82 B: probably ten bucks an hour 

501.35 502.32 A: probably 

501.91 504.98 B: right i mean they'd get college kids i would assume 

502.33 503.03 A: yeah 

504.47 506.06 A: yeah our job's easier 

505.94 507.82 B: (( yeah right [laughter] )) 

507.34 509.59 A: (( so where where do you work oh )) 

508.60 510.28 B: i work at home 

509.84 510.60 A: (( cool )) 

510.84 511.87 B: ah 

510.88 512.98 A: and and you're in you're in the city 

512.62 516.26 B: yeah ah my wife and i both work out of our house 

516.46 521.52 B: and ah i do a lot of ah english as a second language textbooks 

521.01 522.03 A: oh cool 

521.77 529.45 B: and so i i had a piece in the times magazine over the summer about um the um the national corporates 

529.93 532.24 B: ah so that's how i got involved in this 

532.57 541.26 B: um and ah so yeah i have a a vested int- not a vested interest but a an amateur interest in seeing this 

541.47 545.95 B: ah done i assume that this is part of the a._n._c. is that 

546.10 548.83 B: to your knowledge american national corpus 

546.25 547.73 A: (( a._n._c. )) 

549.28 550.93 A: maybe i don't know 

550.51 552.00 B: i think that's what this 

552.24 555.00 B: maybe it's not maybe it's just another corpus but 

554.25 557.24 A: yeah we've always joined the um 

557.29 567.15 A: ah l._d._c. um just to get access to their their c._d.s and and data so um to put 

563.67 564.57 B: (( uh huh )) 

566.18 577.67 B: my understanding of the american national corpus was the first really broadbased corpus of language in that the the l._d._c. was was 

573.32 574.06 A: (( mm )) 

577.95 579.34 B: undertaking it 

579.05 580.11 A: mhm 

579.45 588.85 B: ah and what they had done some of it's out but it's all the written it's like the first ten million words of a hundred million word corpus 

588.34 589.17 A: wow 

589.10 592.84 B: but it's all the written stuff and they hadn't done any of the spoken language 

592.33 593.29 A: oh okay 

593.13 597.73 B: so when as soon as i got the email i forwarded it to all my ah 

597.81 611.04 B: friends who whose english i respected and ah spoke correctly and things like that um so i thought it was really interesting um today's topic though sounds just like yesterday's topic ah 

600.48 601.48 A: yeah 

603.52 604.32 A: cool 

610.89 616.34 A: yesterday as well as i wasn't near my desk i didn't take any calls but got some messages about it 

613.43 620.47 B: it was like basically the same thing it was like ah has anything changed since september eleven 

619.68 621.95 A: oh okay yeah september eleventh 

621.98 627.97 A: i don't know um i i think they'll find another way [laughter] to ah 

627.56 629.43 B: to couch the same 

628.54 639.24 A: yeah i mean as far as blowing up things with airplanes you know i think they'll try something else next as far as keeping you know controlling people and knowing who's going i think yeah i i think 

639.19 653.36 A: i think they're going to they have a lot of plans in fact unisys has some contracts in that area you know i mean they can do iris scans and face scans and hand and fingerprint scans and and that you know i think they'll improve security 

643.91 644.93 B: (( uh huh )) 

653.36 654.68 A: so they know who's 

654.87 658.26 A: going in and the turnstile and who's getting on the plane 

657.94 661.31 B: should we be afraid of that 

661.13 662.22 A: um 

663.51 667.48 A: i don't know i i i think they'll they'll probably use it make ah 

667.70 675.84 A: you know i wouldn't be afraid of that anymore than the fact that i swipe my credit card in all kinds of slots in the foodstore and every bank machine [mn] all 

675.63 686.52 A: everywhere i go so i mean you know they know who you are and where you are so what what's the difference between that and an iris scan it's like okay it's this person and now that he's here he's just went in through the door 

676.74 677.89 B: right 

685.87 688.84 B: um because the government can have it 

688.31 691.01 A: yeah that's true that's true 

689.04 690.62 B: that's what i don't like 

690.75 694.44 B: ah like i won't pay i won't use the ez-pass 

694.36 695.19 A: uh 

694.78 698.45 B: because i don't really like the government knowing where i'm going 

697.48 699.04 A: (( huh yeah )) 

698.47 705.23 B: ah and like you can here in the city you can pay for your um your subway card with a with a credit card 

703.41 704.24 A: yeah 

705.04 705.95 A: right 

705.36 712.57 B: but again i won't i won't do that because i don't really want the city knowing exactly what my movements are at all times 

712.03 712.82 A: yeah 

712.70 717.24 B: um and things like iris scans scare the crap out of me because you know 

717.34 719.89 B: they can use their powers for evil too
