78.28 86.72 B: had spouses who worked on the day shift and it worked out perfectly because when they had kids then one could take care of the kids during the day and one could take care of the kids at night 

87.35 88.39 A: hm [lipsmack] well that's 

87.75 90.90 B: you're saying you're not sure how they have the kids in the first place 

89.97 97.76 A: that's right [laughter] that is what i'm saying that is what i'm saying and and you see and this this keeps a lot of the population down in the world

98.66 99.22 B: (( [sigh] )) 

99.06 103.51 A: (( so what are some other things that i think would be important in a life partner ))

121.34 122.03 A: (( so )) 

121.39 126.18 B: i don't know i guess uh maybe you just look for the things that you don't already have 

127.40 135.76 A: no no that's not necessarily true i mean sometimes there're things you you have and you are and you want more of them you know like people who are outdoorsy 

135.81 136.61 B: uh-huh 

136.01 136.69 A: like 

137.50 142.22 A: and athletic for example often like to be with people who are athletic and outdoorsy 

142.65 143.72 B: that's true 

144.30 145.07 A: so 

146.47 148.96 A: do you consider yourself athletic and outdoorsy 

146.71 147.92 B: good point 

149.16 150.79 B: um not that much 

151.26 152.33 A: (( [laughter] no )) 

152.65 154.20 A: you're an indoorsy person hm 

153.09 156.49 B: i don't think so yeah i uh 

157.06 162.17 B: not not indoorsy as much as well i don't know i don't go out of my way to do uh 

162.35 164.08 B: outdoorsy kinds of things 

164.24 165.96 B: not that i don't like them 

166.54 168.64 A: so what are some outdoorsy things you like 

168.75 170.84 B: (( [sigh] uh )) 

172.53 177.42 B: [mn] what i want to do that i haven't done since i was a teenager is kayaking 

178.21 181.76 B: i'd like to do that and i haven't had a chance to in ages 

178.24 179.09 A: (( oh yeah )) 

181.75 184.75 A: (( you used to go kayaking when you were a teenager did you do that a lot )) 

183.91 185.00 B: yeah 

185.51 189.68 B: yeah my family was into it for a while i'm sorry 

186.40 188.40 A: do you know how to flip the kayak back over 

189.46 192.60 A: (( do you know how to flip a kayak back over once you're upside down )) 

191.54 193.42 B: no we didn't try to do that 

193.55 195.43 A: well then then it's basically 

195.63 197.58 A: canoeing with a skirt right 

197.56 198.76 B: it's kind of 

198.56 199.93 A: [laughter] 

200.33 201.29 A: i mean 

200.50 203.14 B: hey you're not required to flip it over 

203.20 213.37 A: no i [laughter] i guess you're not supposed to flip it over but the whole idea is like you know the difference between a kayak and a canoe is you can get the kayak back over once you've gone upside down right 

205.26 207.37 B: [laughter] 

211.69 212.66 B: yeah 

213.30 214.61 B: that's true 

216.20 219.81 B: so does this pertain to life partners does it matter 

216.23 217.12 A: so 

220.13 222.10 B: were we required to stay on topic 

222.25 226.50 A: um no i think we're allowed to drift a little bit but but uh 

225.00 226.06 B: oh okay 

226.95 238.07 A: you know but you see the thing is you can have somebody who is like a kayak fanatic right you wouldn't want to pair them with uh like a a a librarian 

230.94 231.75 B: uh-huh 

236.65 238.36 B: hydrophobic person 

238.70 240.83 A: well yeah like a librarian

241.48 243.82 A: a hydrophobic librarian who's a l- got 

244.52 247.90 A: what's the the word when going out in the sun makes you break out

260.69 261.76 A: really 

262.25 268.93 A: oh that's awful i mean because you you'd basically have to wear like total body sunscreen and that includes like your scalp you know 

263.42 264.28 B: yeah 

268.96 269.83 B: yeah 

269.18 272.88 A: so it's uh it's not any fun when that happens 

272.64 281.37 B: yeah well she yeah i don't know she just stays inside she she doesn't go out last time she had she had she says she had it for like a year at a time 

281.49 285.92 B: and she basically has to stay in and uh especially during the day

292.02 292.65 A: (( oh )) 

293.04 294.53 B: yeah it doesn't sound fun 

294.73 295.87 A: (( no )) 

296.08 297.02 B: so 

298.49 303.22 B: i don't know if i'd yeah i don't know how i'd react if i had a partner who was like that 

298.75 299.56 A: (( so it )) 

303.66 305.78 A: (( had to be outta the sun )) 

303.82 305.90 B: i suppose i had one 

306.71 309.86 B: yeah it was just um that limited 

311.01 311.98 A: yeah 

312.18 315.02 A: (( you sh- so what were you saying i'm sorry you suppose )) 

314.37 326.27 B: yeah i suppose i had one who was kinda like that she just refused to go out most of the time there was always a reason why usually allergies or something like that i can't go out i have allergies i can't go out for this reason or that reason 

323.03 324.34 A: (( you mm )) 

324.82 328.07 A: allergies oh i'm sorry i thought you said alligators 

327.82 329.20 B: [laughter] 

328.27 330.92 A: usually it's the alligators you know 

329.99 331.54 B: also a good reason 

331.83 339.62 A: [laughter] well you know if you're in florida i mean i don't know where you are but you know if you're in florida or something 

337.56 338.48 B: that's true 

339.93 340.98 B: yeah 

340.49 342.15 A: (( like 'cause of the alligators )) 

342.34 343.07 A: (( so )) 

343.06 344.95 B: i just saw a movie about florida 

343.16 344.77 A: in which case you should like move 

345.09 347.58 A: to minnesota you just saw a movie about florida 

347.48 355.77 B: yeah it wasn't about florida the the characters show up in florida at some point and they were wandering through the swamps and there were alligators around so 

356.15 359.20 A: what movie did you see did you go see adaptation 

358.15 358.91 B: (( adap- )) 

359.05 360.42 B: yeah adaptation 

360.46 361.94 A: oh was it good 

361.51 363.14 B: how did you know that 

363.28 366.23 A: because they go in swamps in adaptation 

366.08 367.15 B: oh okay

371.22 372.29 A: yeah 

374.58 376.64 B: [sigh] yeah it was fairly good 

377.48 384.43 A: well see that's another thing like if you have somebody who really loves movies you should pair them with somebody who doesn't see the point of going out to movies 

384.06 389.29 B: yeah or somebody who wants to see the next paulie shaw movie or something or rob schneider movie 

388.76 393.42 A: no no there's some people who love movies who want to see the next paulie shaw or rob schneider movies 

391.98 393.34 B: [laughter] 

393.67 397.93 A: you know i'll have you know i i could be going to see a

398.30 401.96 A: you know i saw the trailer for the hot chick last night

408.72 409.51 A: (( yo- )) 

409.78 422.45 A: you know the thing is i think that happens a lot more than you think and gen- well come on have we not all seen pairings of paulie shaw guy with merchant ivory girl uh yeah 

413.86 414.77 B: really 

421.56 423.37 B: yeah that's true 

422.70 434.95 A: yeah yeah they both dismiss because she just says oh he's just being a guy and he's like oh she's just being a girl and it's like no you are paulie shaw people and merchant ivory people 

428.93 430.97 B: [laughter] 

434.80 435.96 B: [laughter] 

435.30 436.35 A: you know

494.20 495.15 B: yeah 

500.63 502.17 B: yeah i'll keep my eyes open 

502.15 504.18 A: (( [laughter] )) 

503.86 507.28 B: [laughter] so and then you know there're like the 

507.38 511.17 B: the rock'n'roll guys and the show tune girls and things like that 

512.03 514.61 A: (( oh well i don't know )) 

513.23 514.24 B: i don't know 

514.46 516.05 B: i don't know how that works 

516.19 518.20 A: how that works either 

518.49 519.32 B: yeah 

518.67 523.48 A: but you know you see this is the thing is that people can like rock'n'roll and like show tunes i love both 

523.66 524.71 B: oh okay 

525.45 526.24 A: (( you know i )) 

526.54 527.83 B: mhm 

527.39 530.67 A: mean like i i you know it's sort of like 

532.31 538.64 A: i can appreciate you know uh i can appreciate them i'm trying to think like uh 

538.77 541.08 A: you know a little bit of um 

541.75 543.16 A: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

546.66 549.75 A: you know rogers and hammerstein and a little bit of sid vicious it's 

550.11 550.95 B: right 

550.59 552.07 A: (( all it's all it's all )) 

551.74 553.84 B: what did rogers and hammerstein write 

554.40 555.99 A: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

556.18 562.11 A: oklahoma which apparently underwent you know there's there's like a new revival of oklahoma 

557.58 566.52 B: (( hm )) 

562.30 568.80 A: um it was actually revived on the west end in london a couple of seasons ago and um 

568.81 578.09 A: [lipsmack] it was that was supposed to be a really incredible production sort of like there there's a lot of darkness in a lot of these uh rogers and hammerstein uh musicals actually 

577.08 586.00 B: yeah yeah you know what i work in the uh i work right around the theatre district and i walk past the theatre posters the broadway posters every day 

584.29 585.90 A: mhm mhm 

586.20 599.42 B: and i i'm thinking when i see oklahoma and some of the others especially our town somebody's doing our town right now i'm thinking they should just keep a list of which plays have been performed at every high school in america and nobody's allowed to put them on broadway anymore 

599.05 600.83 A: [laughter] 

600.57 602.46 B: [laughter] that's my new theory 

603.44 605.17 A: [lipsmack] well um 

604.07 608.15 B: i saw our town go up i saw our town go up and i just thought 

608.22 616.45 B: you know it's it's officially over now they don't need to do it on broadway any more everyone's seen it in their local high school and that should do it 

615.05 628.61 A: yeah but the ironic thing is from all the reviews that i've been seeing like uh because there's so many of these broadway productions that are star driven and the stars are generally like stars in another medium primarily film and so 

623.59 624.45 B: yeah 

626.30 627.14 B: right 

628.63 629.54 A: um 

629.89 634.63 A: the funny thing about this production of our town i've been reading the reviews of it is that 

634.66 637.99 A: paul newman's been getting pretty uniformly great reviews 

638.33 639.32 B: he's in it 

638.39 641.34 A: and then it's everybody else in the production 

640.04 641.74 B: i didn't even know he was in it 

642.14 647.88 A: paul newman is the narrator in this production and he's been getting fantastic reviews and then 

644.56 645.65 B: oh okay 

647.91 652.79 A: there's other people it's it's not like the rest of the cast is a bunch of slops or anything like jane curtain's 

652.80 654.38 A: (( another one of the members of the cast )) 

654.49 663.85 A: but the the i just uniformly they just say newman is really great it's the first time he's been on back on a broadway stage in decades but they say he's just fantastic 

659.57 660.33 B: yeah 

663.67 674.12 A: and then the rest of the production is really really flat and there's there's just way too much set preparation and for you know for our our town and uh 

666.82 667.66 B: (( mhm )) 

674.40 675.34 A: so 

674.77 676.11 B: yeah 

675.69 677.75 A: (( [lipsmack] yeah yeah )) 

676.81 681.00 B: now there's an example paul newman and and what's her name no 

680.91 681.93 A: jane curtain 

681.99 683.54 B: not jane curtain 

683.68 686.83 B: the one he's married to he's been married to forever 

684.98 690.97 A: oh joanne woodward oh joanne woodward oh well did you ever hear about his remark about steak he got in big trouble for that 

687.04 688.39 B: yeah 

690.60 691.70 B: no what 

691.84 702.66 A: they they asked him you know whether or not basically he ever had any interest in you know other women or was you know ever was tempted to go outside of his marriage and he said why would i when i 

700.78 701.60 B: uh-huh 

703.18 707.04 A: [lipsmack] you know have basically come home and have steak every night or something like that 

705.89 706.74 B: uh-huh 

707.35 719.89 A: you know and she she apparently and i mean he meant this in in the best possible way but uh she kinda was like you know i am not a side of beef thank you very much [laughter] you know he and and and i saw an interview 

711.79 712.94 B: right 

716.10 718.52 B: [laughter]
