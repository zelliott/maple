134.20 135.14 A: yeah 

134.56 146.79 B: in my in my life i'm i'm a college student so i probably hear about it i probably hear about it a lot more because i'm on college campus and and you know like there's sort of like that like political kind of atmosphere you know [mn] 

142.16 143.04 A: yeah 

146.22 147.18 A: sure 

147.14 152.69 B: but um [lipsmack] aside from that like no it didn't really affect me any way 

153.10 154.65 B: odd- oddly enough 

154.48 155.35 A: uh-huh 

155.12 163.55 B: yeah um and i i don't really i don't travel that much either [laughter] i haven't left the country either probably in about time in about ten years since i've flown as well so 

163.43 177.83 B: um the security issues didn't really didn't really affect me at all maybe i was a little nervous yeah [laughter] it was kind kind of unnerving but aside from that no i really it didn't um mm it didn't really have any any impact you know [lipsmack] 

167.16 168.08 A: yeah 

168.66 169.57 A: yeah 

177.93 179.88 B: um [laughter] 

178.77 182.36 A: yeah i feel almost unpatriotic for us but [laughter] 

181.42 184.37 B: yeah yeah that's the thing i i 

185.15 191.87 B: to me like i didn't feel so much like like that that didn't bother you bother you so much it was the fact that like i felt 

192.16 193.49 B: (( maybe i )) 

193.51 199.95 B: should be doing something different i don't know not not not in terms of like for my country but just um [lipsmack] 

200.89 201.86 B: i don't know 

201.88 214.35 B: because obviously something like something that's going wrong with the world you know like something's messed up and so i feel like maybe at least some help but i don't know it feels like like i don't know the wheels are in motion like a like a kind of a process so i can't really control you know 

206.08 206.94 A: yeah 

214.19 215.15 A: uh-huh 

215.91 216.76 A: (( i mean ))

233.61 234.40 A: oh 

234.63 237.67 A: um i mean it's occurred to me that 

237.72 242.39 A: in some way i ought to be doing something to promote peace 

242.22 243.27 B: mhm 

242.62 246.80 A: i'm not sure how an at home mom in the 'burbs 

246.85 251.61 A: um [laughter] uh in puria illinois 

247.92 248.65 B: [laughter] 

252.63 254.51 A: does that beyond 

254.61 258.88 A: uh being a basically good citizen and being a 

259.48 262.38 A: an as a i want to make that a good neighbor but um 

263.79 265.17 A: [noise] um 

265.70 266.64 B: [laughter] 

265.83 266.61 A: just 

266.74 270.19 A: [laughter] work and play well with others you know whoever i meet regardless of 

270.49 271.43 A: um 

272.13 275.60 A: of what group they might or might not represent 

275.53 276.45 B: (( mhm )) 

275.76 282.87 A: (( [laughter] but that's a pretty weenie kinda thing to do [laughter] that's not gonna do much on the face of things yeah )) 

278.87 280.99 B: [laughter] 

282.23 285.12 B: yeah but i mean like i thi- i don't know i think 

283.02 285.64 A: (( um i )) 

285.47 287.47 B: i don't know i think if you can't like 

287.57 302.25 B: if you can't you know get along with the people just you see meet every day i could understand how you know we're it's supposed to work a little so i don't know i think that's if i needed to have the what else are we really supposed to do i mean we can't go on a personal peace mission to iraq or something like that you know 

302.08 309.11 B: so yeah i don't know that that makes sense to me yeah i think that's i mean it's the most important thing really you know [lipsmack] 

309.43 311.27 B: um i'm trying to think of 

311.47 313.25 B: (( like what else )) 

313.69 316.55 B: (( maybe we should talk about [laughter] )) 

315.71 318.28 A: mean it's occurred to me sometimes that maybe 

318.64 328.45 A: somebody needs to organize not exactly a petition but just like a a letter from the people of america to the people of iraq saying basically 

328.87 333.72 A: our governments might have a a problem with each other but we don't have a problem with you 

334.14 348.49 B: yeah i i wished like i wished there was some simple way of doing that you know it's occurred to me too but it's ah it seems like really easy but it's really not like an easy thing to do at all and i mean it's so much harder to communicate like that than than you would hope it's actually the hardest thing in the world to do 

348.55 350.14 B: and and the thing is 

350.27 353.78 B: like i don't know the wheels set in motion 

354.17 357.51 B: [lipsmack] of war whatever there's nothing much you can do about it you know 

358.40 360.14 B: have you have you like 

360.15 364.21 B: a i don't know how you feel about like what's going on with iraq like 

364.02 366.11 A: man i don't know what to think 

365.69 366.73 B: yeah 

366.29 367.26 A: (( um i )) 

367.78 368.79 A: mean the 

369.88 371.88 A: [sigh] the world would be 

372.24 375.74 A: much better as far as i can tell if saddam wasn't in it 

375.69 376.62 B: (( mm )) 

376.16 377.02 A: um 

377.08 378.64 A: i don't know 

378.99 381.55 A: what the best course of action there is though 

381.39 382.44 B: yeah 

381.86 386.32 A: i have a problem with the idea of thinking that we can just around murdering people 

386.42 387.85 B: yeah exactly 

386.43 388.77 A: [noise] because we don't think that they're nice 

388.53 389.51 B: yeah [laughter] 

389.25 390.25 A: (( [noise] um )) 

390.26 393.11 A: you know oh my three year old's barking 

392.72 394.52 B: [laughter] 

394.05 395.91 A: handy um [mn] 

394.83 396.43 B: [laughter] 

396.38 397.30 A: uh 

397.43 406.31 A: 'cause what gives us the right why why shouldn't other companies or other countries decide that [sigh] you know maybe maybe bush isn't good for the world and take off and murder him 

406.42 408.61 A: you know who do we think we are 

406.42 408.03 B: [laughter] 

408.57 409.97 B: yeah exactly yeah 

408.94 413.65 A: um but i wouldn't be upset if he up and died 

413.80 419.37 A: and i'm sure that there's millions of millions of maybe billions of people who would agree [laughter] 

413.87 414.99 B: [laughter] 

418.57 419.64 B: mm bush 

419.92 420.99 A: pardon me 

420.71 422.78 B: (( are are you talking about bush )) 

421.75 423.38 A: oh no i'm talking about hussein 

422.97 428.64 B: oh okay [laughter] yeah yeah person a lot of the iraqi people too 

425.26 426.50 A: no um 

428.54 429.48 A: um 

430.15 434.17 A: i don't i don't know what the best course of action is but i do know it's a bad situation 

434.03 435.76 B: yeah it really is 

435.99 436.79 B: (( um )) 

436.91 437.92 B: [lipsmack] i don't know [lipsmack] 

438.12 443.28 B: i i mean i kinda disagree with what's going on i don't i don't really feel like 

443.34 451.21 B: i mean i i don't feel that this is the best course of action at all you know i mean the uh invading iraq [sigh] 

446.97 448.54 A: now which part of it 

451.37 452.20 B: (( ah )) 

452.21 454.76 A: have we done anything to invade them so far 

454.17 462.31 B: um no not thus far no i don't know no i'm not talking about like the arms inspections i'm talking about like the like the plan said to you know 

458.52 459.26 A: uh-huh 

462.47 466.13 B: inv- um involve ourselves you know with military 

466.02 480.56 B: if um if the arms inspections don't go well or according to how we want them to go yeah uh the you know i don't think we've done anything invasive yet but um but yeah but i i don't really feel comfortable with the idea of of going in with some sort of military action 

470.60 471.51 A: yeah 

480.48 484.51 B: you know so i i guess i guess in that way like maybe 

484.72 487.66 B: september eleventh had maybe paid more attention 

487.43 501.31 B: to um dealing with that like like with how we treat the middle east and how how we interact with the middle east you know where where foreign policy is there i think i think it definitely made me more aware of that sort of thing so i guess that's i guess it's one change changes have been 

501.18 507.64 B: like a lot more like subconscious and like really a lot more subtle than like i don't know building a bomb shelter in my backyard or something you know 

504.56 505.52 A: yeah 

507.20 513.49 A: yeah well okay you're right that does bring to mind i have started to pay more attention to um 

508.37 509.39 B: (( so [lipsmack] )) 

513.60 523.12 A: the attitudes of the rest of the world toward america which i never really gave much thought 'cause they're there and i'm here and i can't change that so [laughter] 

515.71 516.75 B: yeah 

517.21 518.60 B: i think a lot of people 

519.79 520.63 B: uh-huh 

522.67 523.73 B: mhm 

524.09 531.95 B: yeah i i think i think a lot of americans did yeah 'cause it was kind of i mean i think we're kinda isolated it seems like it seems like in europe there's a lot more like 

532.25 545.45 B: change of ideas and and things like that about what's going on with the rest of the world you know there's more infiltration of news from from other parts of the world and then you get really isolated because you know i mean i'm i'm i'm here in ohio you know i'm living in the mid west 

539.06 539.93 A: yeah 

544.88 545.67 A: uh-huh 

545.63 555.90 B: i don't know i i think i feel like living like even if you are living like a major major apartment center like new york or something i think i think you just feel i don't know you don't feel like the world ever touches you 

550.87 551.68 A: yeah 

555.70 557.66 A: oh i've got a relevant joke for you

626.19 627.02 B: (( oh really )) 

626.83 634.37 A: um so they must be i mean maybe it's just that they were in major cities but they must be more tuned in to [laughter] the rest of the world because 

634.62 637.40 A: um i sure wasn't expecting to see those 

637.01 649.78 B: yeah yeah well i can i can imagine that i mean i don't know it seems like [sigh] on the continent maybe they i don't know are sort of more to those sorts of things maybe i i don't i mean it seems really strange though 'cause we have we have

650.02 652.04 B: like populations from 

651.38 652.24 A: yeah 

652.12 655.91 B: countries but i i really i really feel i really feel like um 

655.87 664.90 B: [mn] like you know newspapers are uh uh kind of print media you know from responsible i think i think it would in new york or or places like that it's possibly because they're like in larger cities 

664.46 665.73 A: yeah that's true 

664.68 672.32 B: you know but here if i think it seems like if you're not like on either coast or something like if you're in in the middle [laughter] it's like 

669.77 670.64 A: mhm 

671.91 672.78 A: yeah 

672.10 683.27 B: i know it's kind of the big wasteland i mean i like the mid west i like it here but it's like i don't know you feel you feel like you're on an island i've like you don't feel like you're being touched very much by things that go on the outside world you know 

683.42 684.43 A: yeah 

684.71 690.46 A: yeah i especially felt that i mean i grew up in a um a rural area i mean really in the sticks 

688.82 689.70 B: mhm 

690.53 691.44 A: um 

691.79 694.79 A: [mn] and i have brown hair and i was considered the different dark one

700.01 704.25 A: you know just going to a university and then living in milwaukee and puria 

704.12 716.66 A: i've met lots of different people with lots of different viewpoints and ethnicities and races and um that's been a big change and then i think how much different it would be if you lived in say new york 

716.36 717.90 B: (( yeah )) 

717.00 719.89 A: um like wow boy how isolated am i [laughter]
