17.59 18.77 A: good thank you 

18.72 19.85 B: good 

20.23 26.04 A: so we're here to discuss the topic of how uh you've changed your life since the september eleventh terrorist attacks 

25.86 34.62 B: yes that sounds right so [sigh] well did you have like any family or anything that was affected by it 

28.07 29.05 A: (( yes )) 

34.58 38.77 A: um no family members directly affected by it um 

38.94 43.90 A: in a business wise i'm in a business myself of of commercial aviation 

43.96 44.93 B: okay 

44.60 50.62 A: so you know i i've i've um through people i know people people who were affected and 

50.83 54.11 A: and uh just the job market itself how it has changed 

54.65 56.86 B: (( yeah tremendously i think )) 

56.20 57.12 A: yes 

57.79 69.35 B: yeah i had one of um my friends from home her ex boyfriend's brother was actually working there and it the plane actually hit the floor that he was working on so 

69.21 76.85 B: it was pretty upsetting but yeah yeah so i feel like everybody could do 

71.18 72.38 A: oh wow 

77.13 80.27 B: like everyone you know was affected in a different way 

80.10 82.59 A: well i'm sure you know i mean it's uh 

82.90 86.60 A: obviously you couldn't be an american or not american and not be affected by 

86.53 87.74 B: (( yeah )) 

86.75 88.25 A: by the date itself 

88.19 95.21 B: yeah so have you done anything differently like since then like in in your life round your residence and everything 

94.76 102.40 A: you know actually i can say that i don't think i've done anything differently that i've done you know prior to as opposed to after 

102.49 103.65 A: the attacks 

102.69 103.66 B: yeah 

103.77 104.68 B: yeah 

105.32 106.31 A: um 

106.64 114.42 B: i don't think i really have either because um like i know some people are like they're hesitant to like um travel and stuff but 

114.24 122.84 B: i don't know i went with my family a while ago to um europe and i didn't feel anything you know there is no difference or anything like that so 

122.06 123.68 A: right 

123.05 124.25 B: yeah 

124.64 129.46 A: i mean on on that front i mean if you allow something to change your life 

129.69 130.75 B: yeah 

129.76 134.09 A: every time an event occurs you know you're always you're always adjusting what you do 

134.78 142.23 A: um to an extremes to just to suit the the uh the time and the time is always transient it's never the same 

134.90 136.10 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

142.61 145.80 A: so you're never really stable yourself so you really have to be 

144.86 145.87 B: yeah 

145.93 150.75 A: you have to be strong and say what you do from day to day just to to um 

151.53 153.64 A: just not be willing to change i guess 

153.52 155.77 B: yeah i definitely think so 

156.13 157.16 B: (( yeah )) 

156.26 161.46 A: you you could do things smarter of course that's always that's always a good option but just to change 

161.60 166.26 A: in terms of uh not doing something is i don't think it's it's good for your personal being 

161.82 162.92 B: yeah 

166.29 178.78 B: no i don't think it is either because if you let someone like or if you let something like that like rule your life then like you're obviously not gonna have one because bad things happen all the time i mean i'm not saying like it's like 

174.19 175.13 A: (( no right )) 

179.14 183.59 B: like what happened wasn't horrible but you know what i'm saying like you can't [lipsmack] 

182.41 183.37 A: yes 

184.10 185.79 B: you have to move on and 

186.80 188.81 B: (( [sigh] it's not easy )) 

188.83 192.98 A: that is definitely true are you in the philadelphia area 

192.40 196.35 B: um ye- um with what area 

196.25 199.05 A: do you live in the philadelphia area i live in the philadelphia area 

198.09 206.80 B: oh no no no no i live in illinois so yeah well my brother works a lot he well he works in boston so 

200.52 201.51 A: (( oh okay )) 

206.60 207.73 A: in boston 

207.50 214.03 B: yeah well actually it's like an hour or two away from boston it's in maramara new hampshire i don't know if you know 

208.32 209.08 A: (( no )) 

213.97 215.51 A: i'm not familiar 

215.51 223.46 B: okay yeah so [sigh] but yeah i don't know how it sort of affected me [laughter] honestly i don't think i 

216.57 217.35 A: okay 

223.75 226.17 B: really haven't made that big of a change but 

227.08 228.56 A: do you find it the 

227.47 240.32 B: i thought it was pretty cool about like how people in new york city were a lot better i mean there are more family on the streets and whatnot so 'cause i went there last summer and i didn't find that it was horribly rude like everyone had told me but 

236.61 238.92 A: (( mm )) 

239.79 240.69 A: yes 

242.48 243.41 A: (( well it you )) 

242.78 243.71 B: (( i don't know )) 

243.61 247.20 A: know it's unfortunate i think we have a uh a short memory 

247.38 248.58 B: yes 

247.85 252.02 A: so you know it doesn't take people long to get back to their normal ways 

252.12 253.75 B: [laughter] that's very true 

252.82 258.53 A: you know it changed soon after september eleventh and a month later they're back to themselves which you know i kinda am 

259.25 268.42 A: not in agreement with how they were before you think they'd be changed for the better but some people just don't i i don't know if it's human nature or or what it might be but um 

267.21 268.42 B: yeah 

269.32 272.69 A: i'm sure it had the the event has changed a lot of people's life 

272.68 274.58 B: yeah i think so 

272.74 276.53 A: um permanently and hopefully for the better 

276.77 279.86 B: yeah yes definitely in that 

280.10 290.57 B: i mean i think that maybe people are a little more like hesitant to fly and stuff i mean maybe like right after that but my feeling is that 

290.81 296.47 B: it's only pr- it's probably ten times safer now than it ever was you know what i mean 

295.02 296.71 A: that that's true 

296.56 303.09 B: i think it's ridiculous to not fly i mean i personally would think like i would rather fly now than i you know so 

302.73 304.85 A: you would think it would be safer now 

304.68 306.78 B: yeah yeah 

306.09 307.11 A: that's true 

306.96 308.09 B: definitely 

308.01 311.34 A: well being in the business you know i mean i get those reports uh 

311.43 312.59 B: oh really 

311.65 316.68 A: and really the travel numbers are are are back to pre 

316.85 326.71 A: september eleventh of course there was a drop off immediately after but people are people are back and traveling more so than they were before right i mean why 

316.92 317.91 B: good 

320.19 321.28 B: yeah 

323.31 325.61 B: yeah as they should you know 

326.17 327.02 B: yeah 

327.79 330.32 B: why worry about something you can't really control 

328.66 330.56 A: why totally change true 

331.12 332.77 B: (( yes exactly )) 

332.15 333.39 A: that's so true 

333.88 336.01 B: so i don't know 

336.04 336.79 B: well 

337.43 339.56 B: [lipsmack] how long do we talk for do you know 

339.35 341.76 A: um i think it's about ten minutes 

341.58 344.82 B: about ten minutes okay [lipsmack] what else could we 

343.76 348.29 A: [laughter] and i didn't get my watch so i'm not sure how far along we're into it 

345.04 345.93 B: [laughter] 

347.70 349.55 B: (( i don't either [laughter] )) 

350.15 351.27 B: um 

350.80 352.45 A: so what do you do out in illinois 

352.76 354.84 B: i'm actually a student 

354.60 356.06 A: okay and where 

355.72 358.08 B: so um university of illinois 

357.95 363.28 A: and and what was the capmus campus atmosphere after after uh september eleventh 

362.15 365.04 B: um i th- you know it was 

365.68 377.13 B: really like there were a lot of people all of a sudden like everyone was like it almost felt like there were tons of people that had relatives there or um well maybe not directly related but like 

377.04 384.23 B: you know their relative was i don't know their friend was working in there or something like that and i think it made everyone 

381.57 382.48 A: yes 

384.68 399.09 B: a lot of people went home that week and um actually classes were cancelled the next day so which was really weird because they never have um classes cancelled for like any reason at the university but yeah um there was 

395.79 400.97 A: (( right )) 

399.18 401.62 B: that and i don't know 

401.60 406.02 A: did you find the other student bodies would be to be more warming 

406.90 408.19 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

408.33 410.04 B: yeah i feel 

408.83 414.49 A: or does it seem like there or did it seem like it was more removed 'cause of the distance the physical distance from 

414.40 426.28 B: i think that there was probably more of a distance than we they sent out mass emails to all the students and it was just you know saying that you need to like have respect for um like arabs and people are 

425.99 426.82 A: right 

426.15 437.93 B: um you know whatever because it's not their fault of what happened and you don't need to like make comments to them on you know regarding these 'cause they had nothing to do with it you know what i mean which was totally 

429.15 429.93 A: (( right )) 

436.40 446.56 A: well did you notice that at all did you did you notice a change in the student body in ter- towards the uh ara- arab population i'm not sure what it is there if it all exists at all i'd imagine that you'd have some 

444.61 445.54 B: um 

445.93 449.63 B: you know yeah we we had quite a few but i don't think 

449.93 455.56 B: i i didn't notice a lot of discrimination or anything of that sort but 

455.62 463.12 B: i mean maybe i just wasn't paying attention i'm sure there are numbers and whatnot and i'm sure there were some cases of it but 

459.42 460.22 A: right 

463.14 477.13 B: as an overall i think people realize i mean obviously we're all at school you have to be smart to get in so you're educated and you're not going to take it out on someone who is has nothing to do with the situation i mean just because it's their you know 

474.90 475.92 A: (( yeah )) 

477.53 482.95 B: [lipsmack] nationality doesn't mean that i mean we've done horrible you know i mean i just think 

480.55 482.79 A: they're responsible right [laughter] 

482.97 487.69 B: people are pretty pretty you know nice about the whole situation and didn't really 

487.91 489.88 B: foster any problems but 

489.06 489.98 A: yes 

490.65 493.31 B: yeah so i don't know 

493.29 502.37 A: did you feel the uh student body was was pro military after it or kinda just still neutral or or just still held their same stance or 

500.21 501.34 B: um no 

501.98 503.36 B: i would 

503.37 506.97 B: you know i definitely think that they had 

507.09 513.47 B: um a better like sense of pride maybe here you know for everything 

510.53 511.32 A: yes 

513.64 514.64 B: um 

515.55 526.50 B: i i would probably say pro military if i had to make a decision because um i know one of my friends was in the army and he was all ready to go and you know 

527.27 537.30 B: and maybe that's because he was all ready you know proud or whatever before it happened and then this just made him more you know vocal about his opinions but [lipsmack] i think that 

530.33 531.24 A: (( yeah )) 

537.51 546.18 B: yeah there was definitely a great sense of support for any decision really that they made i mean you know i think sometimes 

546.20 547.28 B: i don't know [lipsmack] 

547.97 555.53 B: but it was good i there were some people that were obviously against you know the wa- like going to war doing anything 

554.53 555.35 A: right 

555.77 556.63 B: but 

556.85 559.26 B: for the most part i would say they were 

559.33 561.79 B: pro military but yeah 

561.56 562.50 A: (( mhm oh )) 

562.31 569.30 B: how was it at work was it different very different atmosphere were there more you know worries or anything like that or 

569.89 571.00 A: um 

572.17 575.00 A: th- there were i mean there were some people concerned i know 

575.10 576.04 A: um 

576.09 583.78 A: there we had some flight attendants who actually did not did not work or choose not chose not to work after it because they were afraid 

583.23 584.19 B: (( oh okay )) 

583.85 584.84 A: um 

585.33 595.28 A: within a pilot group uh i i didn't notice or hear of any hesitancy towards going back to work it was you know pretty much you know business as usual 

591.39 592.44 B: yeah 

595.43 596.59 B: yeah 

595.52 602.81 A: um and it's almost it was almost under my frame of if it happened once you would never expect it to happen again 

602.81 604.01 B: (( yeah )) 

602.92 614.53 A: you know this whole and ignorant but still it's always the case especially something to that magnitude you know it's almost almost like you fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me they would just never expect it to happen again a second time 

611.09 612.27 B: yeah 

613.72 614.87 B: that's true 

615.26 615.82 A: (( [sigh] )) 

615.77 616.72 B: very true 

615.86 617.71 A: so it's it 

618.91 619.99 A: but um 

620.26 624.87 A: i don't know you just you kinda seeing people just be more aware i guess of the surroundings 

625.18 626.21 B: yeah 

625.44 626.23 A: (( so )) 

626.70 628.75 A: not really hesitant but i guess 

629.35 631.73 A: maybe maybe a little more cautious 

631.93 633.03 B: yeah 

633.42 634.70 A: (( a little more cautious )) 

633.61 637.45 B: very true what um what was i going to ask you there's something 

637.80 642.61 B: oh did you have to do any other training or anything after that happened uh after it happened 

642.62 643.52 A: no 

643.68 644.68 B: really 

644.35 647.42 A: yeah we did not we did not 

646.58 648.66 B: (( the the flight attendants or anything )) 

648.59 655.82 A: n- no they did not but they were from what i understand some changes they are implementing will affect the flight attendants 

656.38 657.28 A: um 

659.80 669.60 A: you know at post post nine eleven kinda like a lessons learned what to do and i'm not sure what they are to to or where things are to be implemented but things will be changed um 

665.38 666.22 B: yeah 

668.33 669.33 B: yeah 

669.46 681.92 A: i'm not sure if they think there's a been put out yet so as we're not really speaking on there's nothing major but there will be some changes and and as far as a pod group is concerned there's i mean out- outside of arming the pilots there has been no 

674.68 675.89 B: yeah 

682.32 685.53 A: there has been no changes made tow- towards it by training 

685.80 686.66 B: okay 

686.47 691.32 A: um you know one of the kingpins has always been is may take a show of the aircraft 

691.62 697.98 A: which is always a primary thing i guess one thing that should be done i guess is just how you handle it how you handle terrorism 

691.92 692.95 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

698.30 699.29 B: yeah 

698.62 707.09 A: 'cause they never really considered it happening domestically you know it's always been international case where you kinda just give in to what they want you know if if hostages are 

707.83 708.78 A: (( are )) 

707.92 709.40 B: yeah that's true 

708.85 713.06 A: are laid on the table then it's kinda like well what can we do to save them 

712.39 714.38 B: yeah that's very true 

713.13 719.95 A: uh it's just been a shock to how do you handle domestically because it really does change the picture whereas opposed to
