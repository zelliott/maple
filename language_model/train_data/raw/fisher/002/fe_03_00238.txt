60.99 61.42 B: oh d- 

61.13 62.86 A: like what what what to look for 

63.37 64.69 A: in in our life partner 

64.81 65.56 B: right 

65.81 67.27 A: oh okay [laugh] 

66.32 67.94 B: so what do you think [laugh] 

68.22 69.19 A: um 

69.62 72.56 A: i don't know are we talking about the spouse 

72.72 77.62 B: i i think that they said life partner specifically so that they wouldn't 

72.97 73.91 A: is a life partner 

77.79 80.93 B: so it wouldn't have to be somebody that you're married to 

81.50 83.12 A: okay so it 

82.11 84.19 B: i think probably they are not talking about 

84.42 87.89 B: dogs or pets or anything like that 

86.86 94.84 A: so this could be for example some person that you decide to share your life with but you're not necessarily married to him or her 

91.32 91.96 B: right 

94.37 95.55 B: right exactly 

96.02 98.88 B: so if if you were married then you probably just 

96.05 96.75 A: aha 

99.53 100.72 B: say things about your 

100.81 101.28 B: your 

101.50 101.82 A: yeah 

101.70 103.14 B: your spouse or whoever 

103.55 105.58 A: okay um well 

106.19 109.25 A: i'd see what would be a real important thing 

109.89 110.70 A: um 

111.38 117.77 A: well ability to converse i guess this is the person you'll spend your life with [laugh] 

113.64 114.13 B: yeah 

116.02 117.25 B: yeah absolutely 

117.91 118.73 A: this one should 

119.54 120.29 A: be able to 

120.45 120.87 A: [breath] 

120.99 121.93 A: talk to you and 

122.39 123.00 A: say 

123.17 123.91 A: make you laugh 

125.24 126.55 A: [laugh] 

127.66 130.21 A: [laugh] 

131.06 133.29 B: that that's the one because 

131.09 132.18 A: yeah 

133.62 139.08 B: life is way to serious otherwise if they don't make you laugh you're up a creek 

135.82 137.05 A: um yeah why 

138.57 141.61 A: my my grandfather used to say that um 

142.77 143.76 A: you have to 

144.11 145.11 A: ah when you wanted 

145.47 145.90 A: your 

146.50 147.48 A: looking for your 

149.06 155.32 A: spouse [laugh] you have to find not the one you like but the one you can talk to and the one who makes you laugh 

149.80 150.33 B: right 

155.58 158.50 B: not the one you like but the one you can talk to 

157.98 160.14 A: well not not the one [[skip]] i mean 

160.41 162.91 A: the the liking itself is not enough 

163.16 163.68 A: because 

163.24 163.64 B: aha 

163.90 165.92 A: at one point this person will become 

166.36 171.99 A: old and ugly [laugh] but you still have to spend your life with him or her 

167.64 169.94 B: [laugh] 

170.15 172.71 B: [laugh] right right 

172.28 175.16 A: so if if you can talk to him and a 

173.95 181.20 B: that's hysterical at some point you're you're going to think that they are old and ugly and unlikable so you might as well 

180.46 183.67 A: well at some point you will become [laugh] one of them 

182.03 189.27 B: right aha old and ugly and unlikable oh my goodness yeah i would definitely say i would definitely say laughter would be 

183.96 185.12 A: yeah [laugh] 

186.15 186.67 A: [cough] 

190.16 193.54 B: and that they would they would be able to make you laugh would be 

193.71 195.60 B: awfully important and that you would like 

195.87 199.25 B: some people just have different habits that i just wouldn't be able to put up with 

200.13 200.61 B: um 

200.55 201.08 A: um 

201.39 201.79 A: yeah 

201.97 202.62 A: yeah 

202.66 205.13 B: you know like i don't i don't mean and i can't even 

202.79 203.21 A: but 

204.62 207.31 A: you have any you have any friends with ah nasty habits 

207.38 211.93 B: no i just i was about to say i can't even imagine what those habits would be but 

208.14 208.66 A: [laugh] 

212.17 215.32 A: yeah l- l- l- let's try to think of something that will like 

215.64 217.18 A: as a habit in your life parter 

216.91 220.03 B: oh this is this is such a small tiny little thing but 

220.63 221.96 B: like it it would just be g- 

222.45 227.12 B: you know icing on the cake if could if they always put their dishes away 

227.22 227.73 A: aha 

227.68 231.51 B: i mean i know that sounds absolutely absurd off course i would i mean i would 

231.71 235.39 B: i that wouldn't be like a paramount in a life-partner but like 

236.11 240.26 B: a certain order i guess it would be a certain order of respectfulness for the other person 

241.01 242.86 B: i am by that i mean like 

243.26 243.77 B: um 

243.39 244.52 A: like respect your 

244.63 245.88 A: desires and ah 

246.44 248.05 B: no i think more like 

248.67 250.43 B: i think more like be 

250.65 251.88 B: being thoughtful 

252.40 252.94 A: being what 

252.48 252.92 B: like 

253.08 254.23 B: being thoughtful 

254.36 255.16 A: ah thoughtful 

255.10 256.59 B: thoughtful as in like ah 

256.55 257.10 A: aha yeah 

257.35 257.94 B: yeah 

257.38 257.64 A: ah 

258.07 259.14 B: like a 

259.53 260.87 B: i i guess if a 

261.67 264.44 B: like that just a really about little things like 

265.11 266.17 B: m- things ah 

266.27 269.60 B: i mean i guess you have to learn for what kind of other things 

270.17 273.27 B: or they would would have to learn what kind of other little things bother you 

273.68 276.09 B: but then being thoughtful about those things 

275.76 277.01 A: well but isn't that the 

277.25 278.27 A: isn't it trues that the 

278.36 280.17 A: do you really want to deal with some 

280.58 282.13 A: somebody or someone 

282.60 283.43 A: that things that b- 

283.57 284.55 A: bother you 

284.92 285.28 A: just 

285.56 285.89 A: i don't 

286.23 286.80 A: diminish 

287.15 289.48 B: well yeah yeah they do 

289.82 293.00 B: yeah they are supposed to anyhow [laugh] 

291.61 296.82 A: [laugh] but or you have to accept him her the way she is 

294.54 296.89 B: yeah oh oh absolutely but 

297.08 297.58 A: mhm 

297.28 300.19 B: but i think i think that doesn't have to 

300.49 303.87 B: and it doesn't mean that quirkiness is bad at all i just think that 

304.45 307.67 B: see being thoughtful eh just even some of the time 

307.95 309.12 B: would be 

309.29 309.65 B: ah 

309.76 311.32 B: of really valuable 

311.52 311.87 A: mhm 

311.85 314.62 B: trait i would think just so i can't think of anything 

315.52 318.32 B: i can't think of anything really specific except for like 

318.98 320.21 B: maybe um ah 

321.28 324.49 B: maybe just doing really nice things every once in a while 

324.92 325.41 A: mhm 

326.11 326.47 B: just 

326.12 328.61 A: have and have they ever been been persons that you 

329.11 329.89 A: ah just 

330.16 332.55 A: thought of that they can eventually be 

332.92 333.69 A: life-partner 

333.95 335.38 B: have i f- have i've what 

334.00 334.57 A: i don't know 

335.80 338.33 A: have there been persons that you

338.60 340.86 A: thought that they could be they life partner 

340.36 340.92 B: yes 

341.30 342.25 B: but they weren't 

342.64 343.17 A: they weren't 

343.28 343.96 B: yeah 

343.57 344.55 A: they turned out not to be 

344.58 345.84 B: yeah they turned out not to be 

345.95 348.47 A: so what what did you like and dislike about them 

349.08 351.91 B: oh what did i like i really i really liked 

352.44 353.07 B: um 

353.99 356.58 B: i really liked how this person made me 

356.70 357.81 B: made me laugh 

358.23 360.90 B: and was very like we definitely we could talk about 

361.42 362.78 B: almost anything 

362.70 363.11 A: mhm 

364.11 364.84 B: and am 

364.90 366.78 A: what did you did you dislike about it 

366.47 369.20 B: and i didn't like that he didn't he didn't support 

369.73 370.31 B: the 

370.48 371.16 B: what i've 

371.41 372.94 B: wanted to do like it was it was 

373.04 373.60 B: we were 

374.22 377.99 B: we were sort of young and he wasn't willing to compromise 

374.33 374.76 A: aha 

378.36 378.76 A: aha 

378.90 379.52 B: am 

379.80 380.53 B: and 

381.26 385.41 B: i didn't i really just didn't like that i didn't feel i didn't feel like he was supportive 

385.91 388.98 B: about about the things that i was interested in 

388.19 391.95 A: like he was more thoughtful about his stuff than yours 

390.97 391.80 B: yeah 

392.07 393.79 B: yeah he was he 

393.04 395.26 A: more selfish 

394.20 396.97 B: yea- yeah it wasn't it wasn't really 

395.53 395.88 A: ah 

397.69 402.47 B: it wasn't even really being selfish i mean he could have done exactly the same things that he 

402.60 404.49 B: did and said 

404.76 407.41 B: different things and that might have made all the difference 

408.23 411.40 B: just said you know i think what you're doing is valuable 

412.53 412.92 B: and he 

412.66 413.03 A: ok 

413.07 414.19 B: he never said that 

414.41 417.04 A: right do you think that you would probably look for a 

417.38 419.02 A: exactly these things in your 

419.23 421.07 A: next candidate [laugh] 

421.30 423.06 B: you know i [laugh] 

421.66 422.21 A: [laugh] 

423.43 428.09 B: i think i think actually i would look for proximity to be honest 

426.67 427.89 A: [laugh] 

435.23 444.30 B: about little stuff like we could talk about anything but then we would we would get in really really good really good fights about things and 

436.83 439.47 A: [laugh] that sounds good 

444.57 447.52 B: not that not that it's awesome to get in fights with people but 

448.00 448.48 B: um 

448.33 451.92 A: yeah i understand we've all had this [laugh] 

450.75 457.27 B: right right everybody everybody has somebody that they can get in fights with i suppose but 

453.12 453.46 A: [noise] 

460.04 471.20 A: that's with your life partner come on you you'll be spending your life person so there will be sometimes he will put your toothbrush in the wrong place and that would make you kill him 

460.98 463.06 B: oh no no no no i don't expect 

463.80 464.54 B: right 

465.03 465.69 B: oh yeah 

468.54 472.34 B: exactly exactly no no i agree 

471.65 472.25 A: [breath] 

472.46 474.56 B: completely agree with you but there 

474.69 477.43 B: there it's like there are different ways to go about fights 

477.80 478.39 B: you know 

478.66 479.15 A: mhm 

478.79 483.07 B: what t- t- you could have really good fights and then you can have fights were 

483.45 484.22 B: things are just 

484.53 485.01 B: really 

485.33 486.23 B: really bad 

486.66 489.19 B: i don't even know how to explain it's like ah 

490.89 491.50 B: um 

492.44 496.16 B: um yeah you're just you're just going to get in fights with people that's all there is to it 

496.69 498.21 B: i don't i don't really even 

498.28 499.19 A: like c- c- 

498.36 498.91 B: mhm 

499.28 499.90 A: constructive fight 

500.13 507.21 B: yeah pret- much yeah if such a thing really exists if it's a construction fight people call it a disagreement right 

500.28 501.01 A: [laugh] 

501.26 502.13 A: [laugh] 

502.84 503.27 A: [breath] 

508.03 508.44 A: am 

508.72 509.25 A: well 

509.40 516.88 A: yeah [laugh] although the disagreement is the the basement the basis that the fight is built on 

510.44 511.26 B: right and 

515.68 516.51 B: right 

516.79 524.51 B: right but but if never gets to the point when you're actually screaming at each other then nobody calls it a fight they just call it a disagreement 

517.31 517.82 A: [laugh] 

524.40 526.81 A: [laugh] okay 

524.62 525.96 B: [laugh] 

526.07 530.13 B: [laugh] i mean i guess that's just been my experience then 

526.95 527.30 A: [breath] 

529.22 535.22 A: ma- maybe i can (( structify )) this ah something that makes at the end to realize ah 

535.73 536.33 A: an and and 

536.63 538.34 A: just makes you realize what the other perso- 

538.75 541.41 A: person's opinion and point while 

539.97 541.18 B: exactly 

541.93 542.67 A: an and 

542.91 545.66 A: em eventually make or appreciate that and evaluate that 

545.81 548.12 A: in future points 

546.81 551.50 B: yeah no exactly that's exactly what it is but the the thing is that with that you can't 

552.18 556.27 B: if you to have a constructive fight like that you can't resort to being 

556.59 560.35 B: really em petty and mean because you shot down the
