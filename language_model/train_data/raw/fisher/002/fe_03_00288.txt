11.69 16.52 A: it said do you think that heightened airport security will reduce the chances of terrorism 

16.90 17.41 A: in the air 

17.09 17.56 B: oh okay 

19.02 19.77 A: so what do you think 

19.37 19.70 B: uh 

21.75 23.07 B: i think it will al- 

23.26 23.73 B: though 

24.50 27.98 B: it would have been better for us to heighten the security before it actually happened 

28.56 28.92 B: and 

29.24 33.43 B: it might it might um you know intimidate them from 

33.53 35.75 B: trying something again through our airports 

35.96 36.59 B: but um 

35.99 36.53 A: uh huh 

37.20 40.09 B: i think overall it will definitely be more beneficial 

40.19 41.22 B: than if we didn't 

41.98 42.37 B: (( )) 

43.02 43.55 A: yeah it's 

43.17 43.69 B: what about you 

44.14 45.79 A: it's not going to hu- it's not going to hurt any 

46.02 46.42 B: yeah 

46.51 47.11 A: um 

47.26 50.48 A: i think if somebody was still really determined they could still do it 

51.31 51.66 A: but 

52.32 52.80 A: um 

53.59 57.78 A: they'd have a much higher chance it'd be a much bigger risk of getting caught things like that 

58.16 61.72 A: then again if you're willing to die for your cause i'm sure you're willing to go to prison for 

62.73 63.44 A: getting caught 

64.03 64.39 B: yeah 

64.87 65.30 A: um 

67.56 68.81 A: it could only help 

69.11 69.54 B: mhm 

69.78 70.29 A: but 

70.60 72.15 B: and it's very hard to say what 

72.67 74.43 B: they should do you know 

74.63 78.78 B: because it's already you know they're waiting extra long and checking everything and 

78.84 79.28 A: mhm 

79.17 79.71 B: you know 

80.24 80.79 B: so just 

81.21 84.09 B: finding ways to heighten security (( )) 

84.23 85.00 B: the problem 

85.29 86.75 A: well yeah and then you think they do 

87.04 87.52 A: um 

88.37 91.66 A: as long as you have humans involved it's going to get goofed up here and there 

92.09 92.57 B: yeah 

93.15 93.57 A: um 

93.96 95.89 A: but i think the all we can do is the best 

96.96 99.68 A: everybody can just do their best and hope for the best 

100.01 101.11 B: yeah exactly 

101.21 104.59 A: and hope that anybody trying to get through doesn't slip through the cracks that are there 

104.95 105.49 B: mhm 

108.73 112.28 B: so where are you from i don't know what else to say about that

285.13 285.91 A: moving forward 

286.46 287.00 B: yeah

313.98 314.44 A: um 

314.08 314.47 B: okay 

314.73 316.29 A: but it's just very slow 

318.35 318.73 A: and it's 

319.14 320.55 A: disheartening sometimes when 

320.97 322.45 A: see him with the other kids in his class

335.01 335.62 B: yeah 

337.26 338.84 A: but one day
