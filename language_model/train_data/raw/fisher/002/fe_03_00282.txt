60.53 61.55 A: just so they're making airplanes 

61.67 62.22 A: safer 

62.33 63.64 A: like than before i guess but 

64.19 68.29 A: like that just means that we're spending resources like one place that we can't be s- 

68.98 71.51 A: i mean that we won't be presenting somewhere else instead 

71.79 72.43 A: and like 

72.83 76.22 A: now that the airplane thing has been done before i'm pretty sure terrorists will just like 

76.71 78.72 A: find some other avenue to attack people 

78.96 79.52 B: yeah 

79.64 81.13 B: that's kind of my thinking too 

81.87 89.97 B: um and i just think that in any large scale effort there's going to be huge holes like with the way people are trained -cause it's still basically a human 

90.35 94.12 B: human error situation because the security has to be monitored by people 

94.51 95.53 A: yeah definitely 

95.69 98.24 B: so i don't know 

98.82 99.35 A: and then 

99.45 102.92 A: like remember what happened in kenya like a few days ago or a week ago or so like 

103.07 103.80 B: right 

103.43 105.92 A: where they tried to shoot down the israeli jet with like 

106.09 107.16 A: surface air missiles 

107.33 107.97 B: right 

108.06 112.88 A: i i mean if they're going to start doing things like that airport security won't even help at all 

113.06 113.92 B: exactly 

114.53 122.13 B: exactly and they're going to know i mean it's sort of like a big game if we're beefing up one way then why would they go back to the same same strategy 

121.59 123.23 A: exactly 

123.10 123.78 B: yeah 

124.21 124.92 B: i agree 

125.90 127.23 B: so you studying linguistics 

127.58 128.18 A: um yeah 

128.37 129.19 B: oh that's cool 

128.60 131.14 A: like not i'm not like majoring in it or anything but 

132.36 136.05 A: like i took a survey class just because i'm sort of interested in the area 

135.65 136.20 B: uh-huh 

137.74 138.29 B: where do you live 

138.53 142.28 A: uh i'm from orlando florida but i'm in boston right now 

142.60 145.08 B: oh i used to live in boston that's a great city 

145.45 146.27 A: so much fun here 

146.38 148.95 B: yeah it's in the fall it's so pretty 

149.61 150.44 A: cold though 

150.37 152.38 B: yeah probably after florida 

152.04 152.96 A: yeah 

153.54 155.11 B: and it's a good place to be a student 

155.89 156.42 A: oh it is 

156.75 160.16 A: definitely so much to do and like so many other colleges here 

158.29 158.93 B: yeah 

160.19 160.66 B: right 

161.49 162.08 B: wow 

163.71 164.93 A: so are you a student too or 

164.77 166.77 B: yeah actually i'm a graduate student in new york 

167.09 168.26 A: oh wow 

168.87 169.88 A: -ll where do you go 

169.92 170.93 B: i go to columbia 

171.45 172.04 A: ah 

172.17 172.87 B: where do you go 

173.21 174.00 A: harvard 

174.46 176.97 B: oh yeah i 

177.15 177.85 B: i um 

178.02 179.70 B: i actually went to tufts undergrad 

179.86 180.19 B: so 

180.97 182.40 A: oh so you spent like 

182.59 184.03 A: so you weren't like from boston just 

184.20 184.61 B: right 

184.24 184.86 A: went to college here 

184.81 186.12 B: yeah i'm from the midwest 

186.21 186.75 A: oh wow 

186.44 192.27 B: um but my sister is a linguist so she got me into this 

190.22 191.63 A: oh 

192.40 203.89 B: um and i was like oh i need money for school so i've like forwarded it to everybody and the thing is the robot calls us like every damn ten minutes when does it stop 

200.28 201.41 A: yeah 

201.78 202.39 A: i know 

203.01 206.03 A: i was out yesterday and my roommates got really annoyed by that 

205.98 209.85 B: i know you have to really be careful about the slot you give because if you give 

210.00 211.85 B: too many slots it just calls you all day 

212.56 213.04 A: yeah 

213.23 213.52 A: yeah 

213.34 213.92 B: yeah 

214.25 215.29 B: so do you like harvard 

215.80 219.18 A: yeah it's actually a lot of fun i'm sort of surprised that the people here aren't more 

219.92 220.95 A: boring 

220.53 223.15 B: no harvard's very hip in some ways 

222.84 223.43 A: yeah 

223.91 225.76 A: definitely like i was really surprised 

224.67 225.32 B: yeah 

226.42 226.70 A: eh 

226.81 228.07 A: pleasantly surprised actually 

228.46 229.72 B: and you're and undergrad or grad 

229.92 231.13 A: uh i'm an undergrad right now 

231.24 231.88 B: oh wow 

232.00 232.67 B: that's cool 

234.20 236.01 B: so that's a big move though 

236.58 237.12 B: yeah 

236.95 237.53 A: yeah 

239.92 240.99 A: so much colder up here 

241.37 241.97 B: yeah 

241.82 242.26 A: it's like 

242.68 244.39 A: the whole atmosphere is really different 

244.63 246.40 B: yeah it's different than florida 

248.63 250.61 A: but i don- i don't know if it's college but 

250.71 253.69 A: i don't people seem a lot less relaxed around here than 

254.06 255.01 A: where i used to live 

255.38 257.74 B: yeah i think boston can be pretty up tight 

258.48 259.09 A: so um yeah i guess 

259.19 259.90 A: you get used to it 

260.12 262.44 B: yeah and you're at a pretty serious school 

263.11 264.13 A: ah that's true 

264.33 264.89 B: yeah 

265.03 267.55 B: so are you getting ready to was are you in finals right now 

268.04 271.23 A: actually no they don't come until january like after our break 

270.08 277.18 B: oh that's right harvard does that oh how nasty it's awful i forgot about that 

273.74 275.19 A: really annoying but 

277.99 279.21 B: my sister went to harvard 

279.34 279.95 A: oh really 

279.39 282.61 B: i remember over every winter break it was like a nightmare for her 

283.08 285.45 A: yeah all that studying instead of having fun 

285.55 290.59 B: yeah when everyone else is relaxing and sleeping off all those hours 

289.37 290.54 A: yeah 

290.83 293.14 A: and the breaks are always shorter than everyone else's too 

293.35 293.91 B: yeah 

294.56 297.59 B: yeah at columbia we we finish next week 

298.20 298.62 A: yeah 

300.82 301.49 B: huh 

301.28 303.10 A: i'm actually going up to columbia like 

303.63 304.17 A: in 

304.55 306.14 A: january (( februaryish )) i think 

306.18 307.55 B: oh you are have you ever been 

307.05 307.35 A: yeah 

308.02 308.93 A: um not before 

309.13 313.05 B: it's really pretty it's really different than other have you seen it oh you okay 

312.66 313.91 A: actually i have seen it because 

314.44 315.46 A: i have family in new york 

315.63 316.17 B: okay 

316.23 316.62 A: and 

317.60 318.08 B: yeah 

317.77 318.92 A: so we just li- 

319.14 320.46 A: looked around at colleges there 

320.79 324.54 B: the urban sprawl yeah it's really 

322.46 322.88 A: yeah 

324.67 329.25 B: i like it it's definitely sometimes i wish i miss a greener campus -cause we're just like 

329.45 329.89 B: big 

330.17 330.51 B: blah 

330.98 331.45 B: city 

331.74 332.68 B: school 

332.45 332.99 A: oh yeah 

332.96 334.84 B: but it's i really like it 

335.85 337.37 A: mhm so close to everything too 

337.67 343.06 B: yeah it's uh there's something about being in graduate school in new york which gives it kind of a wider education 

343.41 345.39 B: because you we have everything 

345.54 347.50 B: we have the city to access just like you 

348.15 348.44 A: oh 

348.82 357.01 A: except i don't know for some reason harvard just seems like more cut off from the rest of boston anymore than like any part of new york can be cut off from the rest of new york 

353.36 354.69 B: mhm 

356.95 360.35 B: you're in like red line zone the red line world 

358.80 359.38 A: yeah 

361.31 365.06 B: harvard square though is uh they've really built it up since i was there i remember 

364.86 366.42 A: uh it's really nice but 

366.92 367.47 B: yeah 

367.72 369.53 A: the stores here are like so expensive 

369.89 371.34 B: yeah totally 

370.44 372.63 A: and i think they like unofficially just 

372.74 373.41 A: discourage 

373.78 374.13 A: like 

374.42 380.05 A: fast food and any other like cheap type of place from like popping up around the square because 

380.17 382.70 A: i guess they don't think it's good enough for harvard square or something 

383.11 387.14 B: yeah they like to have those funky interesting food places that cost a fortune 

385.88 386.68 A: yeah 

387.43 388.49 B: i remember that 

387.63 388.15 A: exactly 

388.63 389.81 B: oh god what was that 

389.96 392.66 B: big it's like vietnamese or something it's 

392.91 395.39 B: for or something it's like on the in harvard 

395.94 396.90 A: oh the hong kong 

397.17 400.05 B: no it's like in the common area where 

400.87 405.15 B: uh where a student building ah i forget but i just remember like the soups that were so expensive 

405.35 405.84 A: oh 

406.49 408.55 A: uh there are a lot of soup places around here 

408.70 409.29 B: yeah 

409.19 410.12 A: and really expensive 

410.62 412.35 B: but you have the charles to 

413.01 415.07 B: bike and stuff i mean i kind of miss that 

416.25 419.45 A: uh that's true uh there aren't really that many parks in new york 

419.65 422.77 B: central park is just you got a really it's a different feel 

420.06 420.34 A: yeah 

423.06 424.72 B: still urban to me 

424.47 424.93 A: yeah 

425.36 427.49 B: do you um do you know what you're going to major in 

427.92 429.23 A: um i'm not sure yet really 

429.94 431.50 A: i'm thinking engineering 

431.78 432.46 B: oh okay 

431.94 436.81 A: so i'm taking classes like for that so far but i'm really not decided on anything yet 

437.17 437.67 B: right 

437.81 439.24 A: what about you 

439.71 441.66 B: um well i'm in graduate school for psychology 

442.26 443.18 A: oh wow 

443.04 448.29 B: yeah which is funny with this whole experiment because i just feel like i'm 

448.60 451.54 B: second guessing everything but um 

450.27 450.81 A: mhm 

452.11 456.37 B: i ju- all i know is i want to see my check for all these phone calls i g- i mean this is my third call 

456.80 457.39 A: oh wow 

457.21 457.95 B: and they've called 

458.13 460.25 B: the day i registered they called two hours later 

461.15 461.87 A: oh wow 

461.53 463.85 B: the robot calls 

466.15 466.85 B: i don't know i just 

466.96 468.80 B: don't have a lot to say about airport security 

469.10 470.88 A: yeah i uh i don't know the topic 

472.21 474.61 A: i was i was sort of like surprised by the topics just 

475.48 476.22 B: yeah 

475.93 476.48 A: they didn't real- 

476.64 478.14 A: they didn't really seem to put to much thought into it 

478.91 479.29 A: but 

479.36 479.99 B: yeah 

480.41 481.34 B: they're kind of 

480.58 481.09 A: (( pranks )) 

481.54 482.68 B: provocative i guess 

483.97 486.64 B: maybe they're trying uh i mean i don't know how many people really get into this 

487.63 488.00 A: yeah 

490.33 493.31 B: so wow so what's orlando like 

493.86 494.54 A: um 

494.94 496.43 A: it's pretty nice like 

497.17 498.80 A: you you have the big city but 

498.98 502.59 A: most everyone else live in the smaller suburbs around it you know 

502.62 503.10 B: uh-huh 

503.17 503.75 A: so like 

504.93 505.58 A: hm it 

505.75 508.52 A: defi- it doesn't really seem like an urban area unless 

508.90 510.60 A: you drive forty five minutes and like 

510.75 511.48 A: go somewhere 

511.99 512.43 B: right 

512.49 512.88 A: so 

513.34 516.12 A: it's pretty nice there it's really different from like boston and new york 

516.44 517.77 B: are the people friendlier 

518.77 519.36 A: um 

521.41 522.57 A: i don- well i guess 

522.69 523.91 A: yes and no 

525.58 525.90 A: like 

527.39 528.90 A: i don't know it seems like the people 

529.71 531.05 A: that you know there 

531.74 535.90 A: are a little i mean like from close to you like in your neighborhood or 

536.49 537.04 A: where at like 

537.23 538.08 A: from like your 

538.59 542.05 A: smaller community like they're sort of friendlier to you i guess because like 

542.15 544.66 A: they know you better and people know each other better 

544.77 548.23 A: but like as for other pe- just other people in the city 

549.01 553.70 A: probab- i'd say probably not just -cause there's not really as much of a chance for people to interact 

555.63 557.57 A: like if you go to a movie theater cha- like 

557.80 560.79 A: just going to a movie theater or shopping or something it- 

561.05 564.20 A: extremely unlikely that you'll just randomly run into someone you know
