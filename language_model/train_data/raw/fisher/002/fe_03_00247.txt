13.73 16.69 A: so do you know anybody personally who got hurt 

16.77 17.74 A: during the attack 

17.87 18.84 B: well 

19.11 22.32 B: um i don't know anybody personally but 

35.74 43.01 B: in fact i just was talking to a guy a couple days ago whose entire office all his stuff was messed up of course he was okay fortunately 

43.12 50.26 B: um we had also folks that work nearby where we are you know who were uh a bunch of people who were on travel who were on the planes 

50.80 51.51 B: so um 

52.11 56.89 B: so i would say i was fortunate in the sense that no i i didn't know anybody directly how about yourself 

57.11 63.34 A: i was even more fortunate because at one time i was supposed to be working for a company that had their office there 

63.50 64.06 B: really 

63.75 70.31 A: and and then they ended up not hiring me i guess it worked for the best yeah actually 

67.15 67.86 B: wow 

69.19 74.83 B: wow have you have you changed anything since uh since that time i mean have you changed anything about the way you 

74.99 76.99 B: you work or live or whatever 

83.18 86.38 A: then they (( treat terrorism )) and not some abstract thing 

86.73 88.59 A: (( )) actually happened and actually here 

88.73 89.38 B: right 

89.73 92.90 A: so they but they stay closer to heart i guess 

92.94 93.39 B: right 

93.50 93.87 B: right 

109.95 120.40 B: you know the level of security uh vigilance kind of goes up sometimes it goes down other times it's still greater than it was two years ago but it's not quite as quite what it was you know when the 

120.48 124.62 A: (( )) definitely is true everyone start panicking security wise 

120.50 121.29 B: weeks 

124.40 124.93 B: right 

124.92 127.07 A: and getting all the checks and 

126.88 132.18 B: right do you travel a lot you know through airports do you find that that's a hassle or or 

132.78 135.44 A: uh i went to israel a couple of months ago 

135.60 138.34 A: so that was a big security getting in getting out 

138.92 139.39 B: right 

139.56 141.20 B: right what airline were you on 

141.59 142.12 A: el al 

142.16 145.19 B: oh so el al has like the best reputation right 

142.62 143.25 A: uh huh 

144.48 149.04 A: right they they do a good job even without terrorist attacks 

148.81 151.56 B: i heard that they that that on one of their flights 

159.18 171.07 B: and were sure there was something wrong with him but they couldn't quite figure out what it was so they ultimately put him in a window seat and they put a sky marshal next to him for the entire flight and that was how they addressed that 

171.79 173.64 A: they're always on the lookout 

171.80 172.81 B: not sure if that's true 

173.46 173.93 B: yeah 

174.09 181.19 B: yeah i i travel quite a bit i've actually found recently um at least in boston washington the places i go that 

181.54 192.73 B: it's actually the lines at security are not very long sometimes i get unlucky and on my boarding pass they you know snap it with an s. then i have to they have to go through all my stuff when i get to the gate 

202.36 208.06 B: you know i'm not sure how efficient they are but just having so many more security personnel seems to make things move fairly quickly 

208.15 208.52 B: um 

208.97 209.37 B: you know 

209.20 213.50 A: i (( )) guess you can't expect people to be on full alert this whole time 

213.79 214.25 B: right 

214.71 215.50 B: that's that 

215.62 216.15 B: that's right 

216.30 217.54 B: that's right 

218.46 221.16 B: i was where where were you then on that day 

222.14 223.87 A: oh i live in in brooklyn 

224.00 224.32 B: yeah 

231.05 239.87 A: and they they start telling the story and i think they are pulling my leg because it sounds so un unreal so i turn on the (( )) t._v. and it's on all the news 

234.57 235.18 B: right 

240.13 241.34 A: and like i (( couldn't )) 

241.48 242.80 A: get what was happening 

242.97 243.42 B: huh 

244.53 248.28 B: could you actually walk outside from where you were and kind of see smoke up in the air 

255.52 257.66 A: they kept bring in patients who had the 

257.97 262.60 A: difficulty with breathing because of all the dust and smoke that's in the air there 

262.76 263.29 B: right 

263.45 264.70 B: right right huh 

276.14 280.08 B: but they then had to leave very quickly i myself was outside of the country 

290.38 294.74 B: friday or saturday i i don't remember exactly when and i was lucky to get back actually on monday 

294.85 300.30 B: um you know i was i was finally able to get on a plane and come back so it was uh 

300.39 306.59 B: it wa- it was tri- i've heard people you know who were all over the county who uh took drove cars from california back to boston and so on 

307.39 311.36 A: the sad thing is this act of terrorism actually went unpunished 

311.96 322.33 A: and this seems to (( )) send a message to terrorists all over that it's okay to to do what they're doing and they are striking all over the world 

324.66 325.09 B: uh 

325.24 329.44 B: certainly maybe a different way of saying it is that it's been well 

329.97 330.28 B: uh 

330.41 335.13 B: perhaps the people who the the the most direct perpetrators of this died 

335.70 343.52 B: they they were in the planes i suppose and certainly um you know the eviction of a lot of these people out of out of afghanistan 

343.668 350.617 B: and the killing of some of them by you know as part of this military operation and so on is is some kind of punishment but i agree with you i mean there's no you know 

351.06 357.04 B: maybe the maybe the the very most responsible people who are still living haven't been captured yet and haven't been brought to justice i guess i would agree with that 

351.17 351.53 A: mhm 

363.35 363.75 B: right 

364.57 364.96 B: right 

365.44 367.04 B: well it's uh yeah that 

367.24 371.53 B: that's that's true where do you thing it's going i mean how do you see this playing out in the next couple of years 

376.68 379.96 A: that they they striking all over and unless somebody 

380.10 383.37 A: has the strength to put their foot down which i guess has to be america 

384.11 385.09 A: because i don't know 

385.46 394.77 A: whether they can they can do it whether they want to to go through with it like now they (( )) this whole inspection in iraq 

394.84 395.18 B: right 

394.97 397.35 A: and it seems to be leading no where also 

397.12 397.62 B: yeah 

397.84 405.71 B: yeah i heard that that just this morning that uh some kind of chemical weapon or something like that they think has been uh 

405.85 413.81 B: smuggled out of iraq into turkey i think and they think maybe that that's a weapon from saddam hussein to al qaeda 

422.94 428.51 B: i guess smuggling is pretty you know there's people have been smuggling things around there for hundreds of years so it's pretty tough to find 

429.69 430.48 B: to to find that 

431.24 436.26 A: that's ridiculous that they give them so much advanced warning we are coming we are coming 

436.37 439.26 A: and and then they have months to to hide their stuff 

439.75 447.17 B: that's true but how else could you do it you know if you have if you need a big army and if you need if you need a lot of equipment and a lot of personnel to do anything 

447.78 453.37 B: what else would you you'd almost have to have you know a hundred thousand a hundred fifty thousand troops kind of stationed in the mid east 

453.90 454.44 B: you know 

454.60 464.51 B: all the time right if you did that then i guess you could have some kind of surprise uh surprise attacks or i maybe with these inspectors do you think these inspectors will find anything 

465.91 466.95 A: i doubt it 

466.98 467.29 B: yeah 

467.50 471.53 A: considering well that that so far they've been unsuccessful 

472.23 474.29 A: like there is no reason to expect that they would 

474.44 475.87 A: do it any better in the future 

476.07 477.00 A: which is a shame 

477.44 486.16 B: yeah i i thought one of the interesting ideas was that if they want to interview some of these scientists they can take the scientists plus their whole families out of the country and to the interviews 

486.39 490.23 B: outside of iraq and so that if they if they did that they might get 

490.40 492.65 B: some of these people to actually be truthful 

492.98 497.43 B: about what was really going on you know under the assumption that they wouldn't have to go back 

497.68 498.40 B: uh and 

498.56 500.86 B: you know maybe that will end up being successful i don't know 

500.70 504.13 A: i guess if you offer them protection and give them citizenship 

503.99 504.31 B: yeah 

504.53 506.45 A: that's sound like a very good incentive 

506.30 515.34 B: right and all they need is a couple of these people if they get it would seems to me like if they get one or two or three of these scientists to say you know to corroborate each others stories and say that 

515.48 517.75 B: there is we- there are weapons of mass des- 

517.84 519.40 B: destruction in iraq
