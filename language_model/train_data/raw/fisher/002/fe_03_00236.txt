56.61 59.01 A: and the most likeable and how long have you been doing it 

59.29 65.69 B: uh for pretty much the whole almost the whole time we've been together i live in new york and he lives in the netherlands 

63.09 63.35 A: yeah 

66.44 67.31 A: in the netherlands 

67.68 68.30 B: yes 

68.46 69.34 B: yeah holland yeah 

68.47 69.13 A: that's far 

69.50 70.16 A: that's far 

69.75 70.14 B: yet 

70.31 70.58 A: yes 

71.11 73.66 B: that's serious long distance yes 

72.67 72.95 A: yes 

73.21 74.63 A: yes but there must be something else 

74.83 77.42 A: in him that or her that made it 

78.36 79.36 B: he's a he 

78.55 80.04 A: curious enough to do it 

80.25 80.61 A: yeah 

80.58 85.39 B: and uh yeah it's it's true but it's uh 

85.58 90.32 B: uh that's that's real flexibility (( )) comes into play cause it's really 

91.08 97.00 B: yeah it ca- the relationship it can't quite work like a fully normal relationship warning 

97.34 97.65 A: yeah 

99.51 100.63 B: um 

101.23 103.68 B: uh but that 

103.31 105.44 A: me cause you mainly talk on the phone or 

105.68 113.58 B: yeah cause we mainly talk on the phone um and we can't even talk on the phone that often cause there's a six hour time difference 

116.20 121.92 B: pretty much only on weekends and we can only see each other that often so it's uh yeah it's very different 

122.30 126.11 B: having to do a lot of your interacting over email or phone 

127.42 129.21 A: is it then weird when you meet in person 

129.46 130.87 B: um 

131.20 137.66 B: it has been at times i we actually had a recently had a period where we were able to spend six months together 

137.84 138.28 B: which was 

137.95 138.36 A: whew 

138.81 141.11 B: i know wow 

139.08 139.54 A: yeah 

141.74 142.86 A: yeah 

142.46 148.90 B: and then that was it was sort of the big task of well what is this like on a daily basis and it it turned out really well and so that was 

149.10 150.25 A: was it in new york or 

150.43 154.19 B: no it was in holland and amsterdam so cause i'm 

153.47 155.13 A: oh not a shabby place either 

156.02 158.72 B: no exactly so i know 

158.20 161.09 A: i thought maybe that's important too that you actually (( )) some very 

161.64 163.07 A: cool places otherwise 

163.85 167.27 A: that i mean i imagine that you're doing things that are interesting and important to you 

167.67 168.44 A: and that's why you 

169.05 170.36 A: why you're not in the same place 

170.40 172.91 B: yeah well i'm getting my degree so 

172.54 172.88 A: yeah 

173.13 176.31 B: yeah at school it gets that's always a biggie 

176.82 177.60 B: uh 

177.22 179.35 A: (( )) that cause i'm dating somebody 

180.25 183.63 A: that i'm also real serious with who's also getting a degree like i am and 

184.01 185.85 A: i wonder if that's an important thing that 

186.53 187.20 A: it enables 

187.79 188.48 A: one to 

189.28 191.72 A: the other person cause you put a lot of time into it and 

192.19 193.19 A: awesome sort of (( )) 

193.68 196.58 A: odd hours and you're never really off and so on and 

196.84 197.68 A: i don't know if one 

198.42 201.16 A: if one's partner was in a more sort of eight to four job 

201.56 202.50 A: it would be harder to 

203.95 204.93 A: you know working at it 

205.51 207.82 A: at times that should seem like they were a time off 

208.91 210.60 B: yeah that's 

213.91 214.22 A: yeah 

216.21 216.46 A: yeah 

216.73 217.01 A: yeah 

222.83 223.45 B: the people 

223.87 225.03 B: well 

225.14 228.18 B: some people it sort of for some people it sort of works because um 

228.29 229.30 B: some people have 

229.61 230.84 B: partners who are in 

231.61 232.96 B: like financial 

233.07 240.30 B: the financial business or some or things like that where oh they work crazy hours too so that that works but um 

238.05 238.59 A: yes 

239.47 239.89 A: yeah 

240.17 240.51 A: yeah 

240.67 243.29 B: yeah i know some people said it's it becomes 

243.49 245.23 B: it becomes tricky because 

246.20 252.05 B: yeah it's hard to explain to somebody well you know i need to work now 

251.69 252.03 A: yeah 

252.49 255.37 A: and then on the other hand like we're in fact in the same field my partner 

256.44 259.37 B: oh me too me and my partner too hilarious 

258.94 262.12 A: and that i mean it means you can discuss all sorts of things 

262.60 263.48 A: the love means (( )) 

263.64 265.90 A: fluid boundary between one of you discussing things that 

266.07 266.46 A: (( )) 

267.09 267.99 A: criticizing 

268.57 269.47 B: oh yes 

269.09 272.07 A: then see each other's work and when are you like lovers and when is it 

272.63 274.65 A: not so cool to criticize or you know you might 

275.55 276.65 A: this emotional thing 

276.87 277.26 A: that i 

277.67 277.99 A: hard 

278.49 281.51 B: ew yes yes and especially this is 

282.66 288.70 B: again one of those yeah this is what happens with academia there's also becomes this issue of 

289.14 290.25 B: um 

310.75 311.17 A: yes 

318.40 319.56 B: and when is it just 

319.83 321.84 B: we're close to each other and we talk 

322.06 322.65 B: like 

323.13 323.76 B: yeah 

324.85 329.65 B: yeah sort of uh not the same thing but that's kind of a related issue yeah what 

329.19 331.17 A: i've heard people say that people 

331.94 332.81 A: said to me how can you 

332.95 336.57 A: be with somebody else i'm a linguist can you be with another linguist you know 

337.15 340.82 A: in then i've also there are many people like us i mean in that field (( )) 

341.14 342.28 A: level like we're both in grad 

342.38 344.01 A: school and also people you know who are six- 

344.14 344.63 A: -ty and who 

345.86 348.15 A: been through it all and stayed married throughout all this 

348.29 349.18 A: stuff you know so 

349.60 351.78 A: there probably is no one answer whether you know 

352.39 354.86 A: sharing all this stuff together is a good thing or not and 

358.10 358.45 A: i want 

358.82 366.05 A: to be with this guy and so i can't you know i can't do anything about the fact that he's a linguist so i can't like could you go and be something else 

362.95 364.04 B: yeah 

366.29 370.07 B: i know sorry one of you guys has to change your career 

366.71 367.29 A: so uh 

369.05 371.95 A: and i don't want to 

371.31 376.93 B: then he has to you know sir i know he's in school but you know he's got to switch degrees that's all 

372.59 372.98 A: yeah 

376.33 376.87 A: yeah 

377.61 381.13 A: he's actually less committed to being an academic than me he might want to go in 

381.22 381.59 A: to like 

382.06 382.98 B: oh well that could help 

382.41 383.11 A: -puter stuff 

383.55 383.97 A: yeah 

387.02 387.58 B: this is 

387.07 388.65 A: yeah we'll we'll have to see 

397.59 397.89 A: yeah 

400.46 403.99 B: my partner's in academia as well and then it gets to that awful stage of 

404.45 409.01 B: there aren't that many jobs how do we find a 

408.32 408.58 A: yeah 

409.32 411.82 B: how do we find a job where we can actually live in the same 

412.11 413.98 B: building or house but 

413.63 413.92 A: yeah 

415.41 417.21 A: have other thi- i know that in linguistics 

417.62 418.67 A: that's the only field i know about 

418.90 421.44 A: there starting these kind of sharing a job positions 

421.71 425.72 A: which is extreme but works for some people say like when you have kids or something 

425.81 428.13 B: oh two people have one position interest- 

426.07 426.72 A: if you can 

427.58 428.83 A: use somebody's fifty fifty 

429.08 431.86 A: fifty fifty yeah fifty if you- you're both part time 

432.48 434.62 B: oh wow no i've never heard of that before 

434.14 434.66 A: yeah 

435.13 440.28 A: starving and so if you're willing to sort of have the lower income which it does mean you have incredible 

440.72 441.60 A: flexibility 

441.79 442.36 B: yeah that 

441.85 443.46 A: and you are in the same place 

444.29 445.49 B: that's really nice 

444.83 447.03 A: but it really requires (( )) balance you know but 

447.58 450.88 A: being able to be professional because i mean you're going to be in the same department 

451.83 452.53 B: yeah 

452.00 452.39 A: keep quiet 

453.21 453.90 A: a really 

456.35 459.46 B: literally together you're two halves 

457.94 458.50 A: literally 

458.60 459.29 A: together yeah 

459.60 461.12 A: you are you are sort of 

461.92 464.88 A: sharing the responsibilities and so on but some people are doing it 

465.60 467.10 B: oh that's kind of neat 

468.58 472.77 A: cause i mean the other thing i mean so are you also fifth on nationalities you and your partner 

473.14 478.23 B: um well i'm just uh i'm an american citizen and he's dutch so 

477.82 479.72 A: and he's dutch right so you also (( )) 

479.88 481.88 A: whole language and culture thing potentially 

481.70 486.15 B: oh yeah i i i don't know and the the problem is is that 

486.31 487.42 B: i mean dutch 

487.59 489.26 B: if i had learned german 

496.60 504.82 B: you know i figured this is what's much more practically useful and yeah i don't know and i haven't picked anything up and dutch people tend 

499.40 499.73 A: yeah 

504.92 505.42 B: speak 

506.21 509.98 B: a lot of it be can speak english very well so i haven't had 

510.62 513.59 B: it hasn't been necessary especially in a big city like amsterdam 

513.88 515.39 B: it hasn't been necessary yet 

515.66 519.95 B: but it's annoying enough you know it's it's that the in between of i can get along without 

520.30 522.04 B: learning dutch but it means that 

522.69 528.28 B: i walk around and there are constantly things i see that i can't read but if i talk to somebody they'll probably understand me 

528.78 529.45 B: so it's 

529.15 531.83 A: and probably also means you and your partner you will always speak english 

533.67 540.87 B: well yeah that would be that's sort of that's sort of like the golden test isn't that if i can get to a point where we'll do that 

534.52 535.29 A: (( )) 

541.77 542.17 B: so 

541.78 543.57 A: cause i'm danish and my partner's canadian 

544.33 546.06 A: and he's trying to and it is 

546.73 548.07 A: hard to learn danish 

549.24 550.43 B: oh god 

549.30 552.06 A: we were there this summer and uh yeah 

552.37 552.94 A: so um 

553.46 554.02 A: so i'm sort of 

554.25 555.26 A: sort of resigning with the 

555.49 557.55 A: fact that we'll probably always speak english together 

557.98 560.95 A: this (( )) because you know i'm fluent in english but 

561.93 564.16 A: you know some people ask me is that weird that you can't 

570.59 574.19 B: it is interesting in that have you noticed there are certain
