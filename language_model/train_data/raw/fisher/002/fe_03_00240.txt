233.79 234.26 A: (( )) 

234.09 234.42 B: yeah 

234.81 237.23 B: so you you actually got married 

237.27 240.76 A: i got married a year after i graduated from college from my undergrad 

237.35 237.95 B: like 

241.02 244.65 B: yeah and you so you dated all through so 

241.60 242.30 A: and 

245.57 246.88 B: when did you meet 

246.76 250.06 A: we met right before we graduated from high school so 

250.81 251.16 A: um 

251.37 252.09 A: pretty close 

254.47 255.13 A: and then we 

255.23 257.75 A: we had a long distance relationship for about five years 

257.99 258.39 B: mhm 

258.55 259.97 A: and we uh 

261.13 265.79 A: he we didn't really set any rules as far as you know what we were 

270.98 271.34 B: right 

274.38 277.19 A: did that and then we got married 

278.16 278.90 A: and we're happy 

279.73 280.44 B: yeah 

280.25 282.28 A: but i think the most important thing 

282.71 283.89 A: i don't know about (( )) 

285.75 286.35 A: gosh 

287.12 294.30 A: qualities in a lifetime partner i mean you have t- i think it's important to be from similar backgrounds and to have similar goals in life 

294.74 296.49 A: (( )) cause we both have pretty similar 

297.01 300.36 A: ideas of where we want to be and what we want to do and 

301.06 302.85 A: um if you don't have those 

303.31 304.88 A: (( )) same goals then 

305.14 306.52 A: think you have a harder time 

306.82 307.12 B: (( )) 

308.83 309.26 B: yeah 

309.55 310.02 A: yeah 

310.53 311.11 A: so 

310.89 313.32 B: yeah i mean i think that 

313.66 315.82 B: i mean i think that even um 

323.26 325.44 B: be it a small goal but it 

324.92 325.57 A: yes 

325.54 331.07 B: just like it's the same thing like as long as you want the same things mostly or even 

331.77 332.46 B: i don't know 

333.83 337.26 A: yeah i know what you're saying i think you're right you do you do have to 

335.34 335.98 B: yeah 

337.93 341.29 A: you have to ha- you have to share similar outlooks on life 

341.45 342.37 B: yeah exactly 

342.16 343.15 A: and have 

343.37 345.18 A: similar life goals or you're just 

345.00 345.36 B: yeah 

345.30 346.87 A: it's not going to work and so many 

347.22 348.41 A: so many people end up 

348.91 349.95 A: divorced or 

352.12 352.97 A: uh i don't know 

353.29 357.94 A: cheating on their partners and things and and i think that today 

358.81 363.99 A: and more difficult to get someone that and then to to stick to the commitment 

362.03 362.45 B: yeah 

364.41 365.64 B: right it's true 

365.89 368.05 A: it's really easy to say i'm done 

366.30 366.72 B: yeah 

369.02 369.50 B: yeah 

369.31 370.82 A: i'm not doing this anymore 

371.31 374.88 A: and i'm not going to lie to you i've had those days 

374.34 374.78 B: very 

375.02 375.91 A: but um 

376.82 378.14 A: but it's not it's not worth it 

378.81 379.22 B: yeah 

379.32 379.95 A: to actually 

380.81 381.36 A: do that 

381.44 382.12 A: we have fun 

381.76 384.30 B: right to actually like follow through with the 

384.52 385.77 B: feeling of the moment 

392.28 395.49 A: (( pull )) and you know you have problems you have to work through 

396.00 396.94 B: yeah that's true 

396.34 396.70 A: and 

396.95 399.19 A: you have good times and you have bad times and 

400.28 402.94 A: and that's just the way life is i mean that's life in general 

403.58 404.05 B: yeah 

403.97 406.33 A: and i think a lot of people don't realize that relationships work 

406.43 406.89 A: same way 

407.96 409.90 B: yeah that is true i mean because 

411.43 412.38 B: i don't know i don't 

413.07 413.73 B: really 

414.54 419.97 B: having angst i don't have any like firsthand experience with separations or anything cause i mean 

420.09 422.30 B: my parents are still together and stuff like that but 

423.14 424.09 B: yeah i mean 

424.69 432.49 B: and even seeing them like they've had good times and bad times and obviously i noticed i mean i lived with them for a long time 

430.17 430.54 A: sure 

432.07 432.87 A: exactly 

432.84 437.27 B: and you grow to know these things and i even um 

438.15 439.10 B: like on 

439.85 441.08 B: having an influence on 

441.19 442.50 B: me or any 

442.76 446.89 B: people who grew up in different situations like knowing that they 

447.30 449.31 B: still like love each other and are 

449.54 450.92 B: working together 

451.14 452.33 B: like uh after 

453.10 453.71 B: stuff that 

454.10 455.63 B: has happened in life that 

455.75 457.64 B: you've seen good times and bad times you like 

458.00 461.45 B: it eh it has an influence on you whereas like i don't know if people just can't 

462.59 464.86 B: understand that it's not always yeah always going to be 

464.65 465.02 A: right 

464.98 465.68 B: totally 

466.08 469.36 B: wonderful like honeymoon all the time 

469.57 470.32 A: yeah 

470.29 470.77 B: yeah 

470.86 474.23 A: you see yo- you know you see different things on t._v. 

474.69 475.20 A: you see these 

475.52 477.12 A: portrayals of things on the 

478.07 478.85 A: a lot of times 

479.91 480.54 A: not real 

481.62 483.58 A: or read in books or 

484.30 485.35 A: i don't know where people get 

485.62 492.62 A: idealized ideas of the way relationships work (( )) they're definitely work 

490.17 490.70 B: yeah 

493.11 494.01 B: yeah i mea- 

493.13 497.63 A: but they're fun and they're very rewarding and if you if you are lucky enough to find someone that 

497.88 500.95 A: you can make it work with i think it makes all the difference in the world 

501.52 501.88 B: yeah 

502.91 503.49 B: i mean if 

503.92 504.45 B: i mean 

504.55 513.26 B: you can have a picture of an ideal relationship and it doesn't have to be perfect all the time and that's just how it's going to be and and that doesn't mean that it has to be any less ideal for you 

513.36 513.65 B: but 

513.37 513.77 A: right 

514.41 514.79 B: yeah 

515.71 519.45 B: yeah and i also you know i really what i realized i really do love about um 

515.79 516.44 A: yeah 

519.85 525.23 B: my relationship is like my friendship i guess i think that's the thing i really like 

523.15 523.51 A: yes 

525.21 525.87 A: yeah 

525.84 526.66 B: because 

526.66 527.14 A: right 

528.63 530.02 A: it can't just be 

528.75 529.22 B: i mean i 

531.97 532.89 A: whatever you need 

533.07 533.58 A: you need to 

533.75 535.66 A: backed by a solid friendship 

535.85 536.41 B: right 

536.77 539.62 B: and that i mean that can even be different from like having 

539.73 542.63 B: same goals and stuff i mean it is different but it's 

543.09 544.09 B: it's just having 

544.45 549.28 B: that one fr- that friend that's like there for a lifetime you know that 

549.45 550.29 B: they are there 

550.48 550.95 A: yeah 

550.85 555.06 B: that he's there for my (( )) whoever's there and i mean 

552.97 553.53 A: yeah 

554.49 554.92 A: yep 

556.09 556.80 B: and that's 

557.16 558.86 B: a very important thing and i think if you 

559.33 559.73 B: can't 

560.03 562.66 B: be friends then that would be bad 

562.81 565.44 B: or i don't know is bad for some people but 

562.84 563.58 A: (( that is )) yeah 

564.35 565.84 A: no i think you're right 

566.76 570.60 A: i think you're right because actually we talk about that a lot how we're we're like best friends and 

570.60 571.04 B: yeah 

571.31 572.12 A: and um
