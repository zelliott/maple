1.67 3.64 A: hi matthew i'm susan 

3.36 5.01 B: susan nice to meet you 

4.86 6.48 A: nice to meet you too 

6.63 11.49 B: um i'm happily married and uh i i guess what i would look for 

11.63 14.36 B: in a life partner would be um 

14.62 17.18 B: just similarities between the two of us 

17.10 18.09 A: mhm 

18.93 20.77 A: what kinds of similarities 

20.50 24.76 B: uh similarities like um maybe religion and education 

24.64 25.96 A: mhm 

25.35 33.19 B: um and you know sometimes i think after a couple of dates you kinda know what they want out of life 

33.59 36.88 B: and you know if it coincides with what you want out of life 

34.71 40.53 A: mhm so kind of similar values and priorities 

39.92 41.71 B: yeah yeah 

41.27 42.48 A: mhm 

42.08 51.48 B: um i know i know there's a lot of other things that are involved but i think that's one of the most the the one of the the biggest things that people think about 

47.98 49.21 A: yeah 

51.26 63.30 A: well i would definitely agree with that i think [sigh] to have a a good [sigh] long term or lifelong relationship it's important to share similar values um i'm i'm not married but 

63.38 67.60 A: the the kinds of things that [sigh] i think um 

67.82 72.49 A: [lipsmack] are important you know along with values and priorities like 

72.50 74.30 A: like you were saying um 

75.04 78.02 A: [sigh] are things like integrity and 

78.13 79.44 B: (( mhm definitely )) 

79.25 80.49 A: yeah 

80.89 85.68 B: just to just know that they're on the same playing field as you are 

85.85 87.64 A: yeah exactly 

86.33 87.33 B: (( so to speak )) 

87.97 89.46 A: and 

89.55 93.99 A: i guess that that probably is high on my list cause that's something i've um 

94.71 100.05 A: [sigh] had a bad experiences with in the past [laughter] so 

97.27 98.25 B: oh 

98.30 103.75 B: [laughter] so you definitely want a guy who's got his head down where it belongs [laughter] 

103.10 107.21 A: yeah exactly in that yeah but you know 

104.45 106.06 B: feet on the ground 

107.54 111.81 A: is what he says he is and represents himself 

109.29 110.76 B: mhm 

112.45 118.13 A: accurately and [sigh] you know is willing to compromise when necessary and 

117.92 123.23 B: well and like it says if a life partner i always think that before you get 

118.21 119.07 A: (( in mhm )) 

122.89 123.77 A: (( cherish )) 

123.33 131.15 B: married or before you really devote yourself to a relationship you should think is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with 

131.06 132.06 A: (( them until death do )) 

131.77 134.51 B: is the vows that my wife and i made were 

132.08 132.86 A: (( us part )) 

134.56 138.45 B: uh we considered to be to god you know and to one another 

138.52 140.19 B: that we were going to be 

140.29 144.57 B: uh you know we were going to honor them and [noise] 

144.48 145.97 A: mhm 

145.02 149.59 B: and uh you know i i know it's so often now people get divorced 

147.62 151.19 A: [noise] yeah 

150.83 152.42 B: but 

152.85 156.95 B: we seem real happy we've been married for going on four years now 

155.97 156.54 A: (( [sigh] )) 

157.15 158.43 A: oh that's great 

158.08 167.39 B: and um we st- we don't have children yet but we're we're working on that we as soon as i get out of school my wife has already finished her education and she's a mortician 

167.38 177.39 B: she got her bachelors at the university of minnesota and i'm working on my bachelors here in oklahoma we moved to oklahoma and i wanna be a school teacher 

170.18 171.51 A: mhm 

177.32 184.18 B: so i've got about two years left before i'm done and then we'll we'll start having hopefully having kids [laughter] 

184.15 190.91 A: that sounds great s- so it sounds like you've both kind of helped each other out as you've been going through school and 

189.31 197.31 B: definitely yeah yeah you know she's if it wasn't for my wife there's no way i could have made it 'cause you know with with uh 

197.34 206.08 B: i had a house before and i had debt and there was no way i could do school and work the same you know the same do do them both 

205.96 207.11 A: yeah 

206.27 207.42 B: and so 

207.47 215.16 B: she helped me out a lot being able to you know afford going to school and giving me the courage to go you know [laughter] 

214.91 217.94 A: mhm yeah a partner just like that can 

218.38 221.89 A: be really helpful [sigh] invaluable i think 

219.62 220.49 B: yeah 

222.17 226.55 B: i think it's uh good for a person in general just to be with somebody 

226.44 228.42 A: (( mhm i agree )) 

228.01 229.93 B: rather than to be alone 

231.10 233.98 A: [laughter] i agree with that i um 

234.27 241.20 A: [lipsmack] the guy that i'm dating right now who probably i will end up marrying we'll see is a he's a writer 

238.89 239.98 B: well good 

241.04 242.09 B: wow 

241.51 243.83 A: and [sigh] is uh 

244.40 246.67 A: still working on getting published so 

246.47 247.79 B: mhm 

247.30 254.14 A: you know we end up kind of helping each other out and encouraging each other so i think that's important 

251.97 252.95 B: wow 

253.23 255.58 B: oh very important 

255.61 257.66 B: always wanted to write a book 

258.12 264.48 B: i always thought that would just be the most fun has has it rubbed off on you or you're gonna try writing perhaps 

261.62 262.85 A: (( [laughter] )) 

263.40 271.95 A: [noise] [noise] no i well not uh not fiction i don't think i'm not nearly as creative so 

271.01 271.93 B: yeah 

273.00 285.44 B: well my wife and i both love to read and uh she loves to read more than i do but we both enjoy it and uh she reads anything she most of the time was doesn't read fiction all that often 

275.48 276.52 A: mhm 

285.49 286.32 B: uh 

286.62 290.00 B: but any more what else what is there but fiction you know 

290.24 291.06 A: (( [laughter] )) 

290.25 299.64 B: all the everything is pretty much but uh i guess i would say she doesn't read a whole lot of the space stuff and uh a lot of the far fetched fiction but she reads uh 

300.11 303.48 B: like lately she's been reading these stories about um 

304.00 306.98 B: older women who help each other out 

307.06 308.65 A: mhm wow 

307.57 316.46 B: who are either living together as friends trying to cope with life and stuff and so she's been telling me some good stories about what she's been reading 

316.57 318.69 A: and they're fiction or nonfiction 

318.44 319.82 B: they're fiction 

319.33 321.20 A: yeah 

321.92 330.23 B: and uh i guess right now she she's reading one about uh the same concept except they're it's set back during the civil war 

332.32 334.66 B: so that one's kinda got a little bit of uh 

334.87 337.52 B: hi- history in it a- as well as fiction 

338.95 340.67 A: that sounds great 

341.03 342.36 A: [sigh] well you 

341.14 343.38 B: so how long have you been dating 

343.66 346.45 A: um let's see about ten months now 

346.10 347.27 B: wow okay 

347.26 350.72 A: yeah and actually i was married before 

350.39 351.73 B: oh really 

351.21 358.82 A: yeah so i was kind of interested about what you said about divorce because i have some similar feelings about that but 

359.02 359.93 B: yeah 

359.33 360.81 A: um [sigh] 

360.49 364.88 B: it's just i don't know my wife and i talk about it 'cause we've 

365.17 366.85 B: had our secretary 

366.90 371.37 B: at the funeral home uh she just started an- and we really like her and uh 

372.31 376.52 B: she got a divorce just like about two weeks ago 

376.51 377.86 A: yeah 

376.70 378.79 B: and we went on vacation 

379.38 388.11 B: and everything was fine when we left for vacation but as soon as we got back she said everything had gone wrong and they're ge- they were filing for a divorce 

388.24 391.23 B: (( and we were and they're and some of the )) 

391.59 392.66 A: oh 

392.47 402.16 B: things i've heard about this guy or what he did to her and what he's doing and how he's abandoning his child and his wife is just you wonder what is he thinking you know 

400.46 402.23 A: (( [noise] )) 

403.16 404.25 A: so it 

404.32 410.73 A: it sounds like it wasn't stuff that just came up all of a sudden but perhaps there were things that you didn't really see 

410.34 414.05 B: yeah a lot of things that we hadn't known about you know 

411.59 413.11 A: (( [noise] )) 

414.16 415.11 B: but uh 

415.24 418.23 B: it's just it's a sad deal for everybody 

417.88 419.67 A: yeah 

418.50 429.15 B: that- that's part of the reason why i want to be a teacher is uh especially the elementary teachers i've i'm hearing people tell me almost every time i get a a chance to talk to folks around the school that they 

429.04 434.25 B: that they uh they say that they they really are happy that i'm going into the field because 

429.23 430.34 A: mhm 

434.18 446.29 B: children don't have the male role models anymore a lot of them they're single you know single parents and the mother's usually the parent the fathers they don't know where they are [laughter] you know 

444.60 449.35 A: mhm 

446.39 453.99 B: and uh so i'm kinda i kinda feel like hopefully i'm doing my part if i could at least be a positive male role model i'll be doing my part 

453.81 456.74 A: yeah so you wanna teach elementary school 

456.36 457.39 B: yes 

457.43 458.66 B: yeah 

458.44 460.06 A: that's great 

459.16 462.63 B: i think i'd really like to teach second or first actually 

462.41 467.04 A: (( mhm )) 

463.48 465.59 B: just because they seem so [sigh] 

465.92 478.09 B: eager to learn and so happy to be at school and i know i was at that grade and as soon as i got into junior high and wa- you know middle school and high school you just started thinking it was a drag you know 

478.34 482.78 B: and so i kinda wanted to be around where they were still happy you know 

482.75 486.35 A: well maybe you can encourage them to continue to enjoy school 

485.62 487.90 B: [laughter] yeah exactly 

488.69 492.24 B: well let's see i guess my wife and i dated for um 

493.31 497.15 B: [sigh] right out about over a year before we got married 

496.00 497.59 A: mhm 

497.25 502.90 B: so we're kind- we were kind of sa- you know taking the same timeline as what you are 

498.38 507.41 A: mhm yeah so how old were you when you got married 

507.04 510.33 B: i was uh twenty one when i got married 

507.47 513.44 A: mhm 

510.70 514.69 B: and my wife she was twenty two going on twenty three 

515.50 520.28 A: mhm 

516.68 518.73 B: and uh you know 

519.00 524.24 B: i think that was a little young but for some reason it seems to be working [laughter] 

523.67 536.75 A: yeah you know it often does for many people i think and i think it it it's really depends on on the individual yeah i i got married really young 

530.31 531.17 B: yeah 

531.27 533.93 B: i i agree with you one hundred percent there 

534.00 536.50 B: i mean it just some people are ready 

536.52 537.50 B: oh really 

537.28 540.51 A: yeah so well about a [laughter] i was twenty one 

540.31 544.63 A: but for me i i'd just you know i wasn't ready 

540.68 541.76 B: [laughter] 

544.40 557.96 A: i i hadn't really thought through what i wanted and i i got married for reasons that i don't think are really good reasons and and didn't really think about what i was doing clearly so 

547.02 547.93 B: yeah 

558.14 560.84 A: i think there was just a lot of um 

560.91 561.84 A: pressure 

562.16 562.97 B: yeah 

562.28 572.97 A: from a lot of different sources so mhm 

565.18 568.23 B: that sure is true there is a lot of pressure from 

568.32 570.90 B: family and from peers sometimes 

572.87 587.18 A: yeah there really can be but i'm glad it's working out well for you that's good 

576.24 581.92 B: yeah i like you said i think some people at a young age are just m- maybe ready 

582.07 592.61 B: more so than others and then you know i th- i who knows what all that entails as far as why they're that way but i think both of us she's a little bit older than i am and 

592.62 594.39 B: uh we just seem to've 

594.64 596.53 B: been at the right points in our life 

597.08 599.85 A: yeah that's important 

597.45 603.66 B: for it but like i said i i'm just so thankful to have somebody here with me every day 

603.63 622.06 A: mhm yeah 

603.89 604.84 B: because 

604.92 614.67 B: you know i i as a guy guys do crazy things sometimes and and if i was alone all the time [laughter] you know if i was a bachelor uh heaven help me you know 

614.85 619.31 B: 'cause sometimes you know you need that person there to keep your life safe 

620.00 622.51 B: kinda keep you keep you in order 

623.91 626.88 A: well it sounds like you really value her a lot too 

626.71 635.76 B: but yes i do and vice versa i mean and you know that's one thing i think you should look into as far as you were talking about uh 

629.00 641.40 A: (( yeah )) 

636.20 637.20 B: uh 

638.72 642.02 B: the well i guess like their conduct how they 

641.91 643.94 A: how 'bout integrity 

643.30 651.26 B: uh integrity that's right and uh that would be you know if whether or not they would value you as a person how much they 

650.49 663.04 A: (( mhm )) 

651.55 655.32 B: you know how much do they appreciate other people you know 

655.88 661.97 B: and i knew right off like after the second date that she really did appreciate people 

662.47 665.50 B: and she appreciated the things that i would do for her 

664.81 679.80 A: mhm mhm oh that's great yeah i think and for me integrity really is uh at the top of my list 

665.66 669.70 B: and you know i certainly appreciated the things that she did for me 

679.63 680.43 B: yeah 

679.66 681.95 A: there are a bunch of other things that i look for too 

681.64 682.52 B: (( mhm )) 

681.96 683.15 A: that um 

683.74 692.17 A: kinda like you said you know common values and priorities and and the ability to to communicate and [sigh] you know 

692.66 696.98 A: but i think at least for me integrity is really right up there at the top of my list 

696.64 702.24 B: well i would have to agree with you again integrity you know you know if somebody 

702.40 704.73 B: has that quality that 

704.85 712.40 B: they can't be all bad [laughter] if they you know they're not gonna surprise ya [laughter] hopefully anyway 

710.29 712.07 A: yeah 

712.53 715.58 A: (( yeah i would agree with that )) 

714.16 716.54 B: it sounds like you ha- have a dog 

716.81 719.14 A: yes i do [laughter] 

718.42 719.89 B: well i've got three cats
