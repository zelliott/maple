0.22 1.26 B: hello 

0.69 3.73 A: hi i'm pat and you are 

3.26 4.59 B: i'm alvin 

4.27 5.65 A: hi alvin 

5.77 8.62 A: ah so what do you think about the topic 

8.50 14.34 B: um i the topic is airport security i guess the question was 

14.37 17.67 B: do we think that heightened security 

18.57 21.95 B: lessens the chance of terrorist attacks in the air 

21.11 23.19 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] 

22.09 23.07 B: um 

24.40 26.25 B: i certainly think that the 

27.15 29.97 B: chance of of that is far lower 

30.69 33.19 B: now than it was before september eleven 

33.23 34.23 B: um 

34.76 35.88 B: um 

37.76 40.11 B: mostly because 

40.18 49.05 B: we immediately changed the rules of engagement ah as it were on on on dealing wi- with with hijackers um 

47.55 48.67 A: mhm 

49.90 52.65 B: um and so 

53.58 54.82 B: i think the next 

55.15 66.19 B: big terrorist attack will be planned for as by to be done by some other means and the chance of what happened before um i- is greatly lessened 

59.76 62.33 A: [noise] right 

65.62 67.05 A: mhm 

67.87 69.63 B: what do you think 

69.02 75.09 A: [sigh] i agree i um definitely think ah the increase of security will 

75.11 80.28 A: ah decrease the ah chances of terrorist attacks 

80.38 81.50 A: um 

83.01 83.85 A: ah 

85.37 86.48 B: s- 

86.63 88.39 B: so i'm 

88.40 89.53 B: in some sense 

90.21 95.38 B: they have heightened security i am glad they're fortifying cockpit doors 

95.81 97.06 B: and 

97.42 99.82 B: basically saying that 

100.15 101.92 B: that hijackers will 

103.05 104.49 B: will not be able to 

104.56 106.74 B: access pilots and will not be able to 

106.75 109.25 B: get in the cockpits and will 

109.44 111.85 B: therefore have little incentive to to 

112.35 114.30 B: to try that um 

114.95 120.45 A: not only doors they're also adding ah undercover 

121.28 125.53 A: um marshalls and on the planes 

121.51 122.90 B: sky marshalls 

125.83 129.98 A: um in case anything occurs then they would 

130.10 132.16 A: (( um react )) 

133.81 136.30 B: um you know i don't have a good sense of 

136.52 142.57 B: just what percentage of flights have sky marshalls on them um they'd be rather swamped 

141.39 143.22 A: mhm that's probably a good thing 

142.68 147.63 B: well it's good you don't the the potential hijackers don't know which flights they're on 

146.30 147.56 A: exactly 

149.73 150.82 B: um 

153.44 154.77 B: but 

155.20 157.21 B: i guess well i don't know how much 

157.29 158.78 B: good other 

159.22 161.23 B: security measures are doing with 

161.37 162.11 B: with 

162.19 165.32 B: this like randomly deciding which passengers to 

165.50 168.28 B: search or whatever i suppose that 

168.92 170.23 B: (( with )) 

171.33 180.38 B: the immediate measures taken that the threat of hijacking and using the the commercial airliners as um projectiles 

180.50 181.49 B: um 

182.77 184.23 B: (( has been greatly diminished )) 

184.58 186.33 B: that 

186.77 187.98 B: the bigger 

188.07 190.20 B: issue becomes um 

190.34 197.92 B: um explosives and being stored in in in in baggage and um 

199.19 201.06 B: other measures are 

201.25 203.06 B: being put in place to 

203.20 205.39 B: to address those um 

205.89 208.31 B: um i don't know how 

207.81 208.37 A: (( mm )) 

208.72 210.43 B: well that's proceeding or how 

210.63 213.79 B: what degree of security it's it's providing [noise] 

213.23 214.50 A: mhm 

214.80 215.80 A: right 

216.92 218.09 A: um 

218.11 219.27 A: hm 

222.26 226.79 A: how and on the other hand how good is all this security 

226.74 228.38 A: (( if um )) 

228.23 232.51 A: attackers are going to be let into the system 

232.34 239.35 A: via different a route for example if when you mention you know baggage handlers 

239.16 248.78 A: um you know there's a rumor that ah there were inside people that was involved um in the ah 

249.48 251.81 A: the hijacking um 

252.41 256.35 A: if people are employed that are are 

257.02 267.07 A: are potential terrorists um then n- no matter how much security that that has been put into place since september eleven 

267.26 275.25 A: ah they still have a way in to ah attack and that's through um being employed 

275.27 276.25 A: um 

276.43 278.51 A: (( what do you think of that [noise] )) 

276.72 281.16 B: yeah well well yeah part part of the new security is um 

281.27 282.10 B: ah 

282.38 286.84 B: ah investigating the the the people who will who are employed in 

287.00 293.03 B: ah various aspects of airport operations ah and indeed the the 

290.88 291.85 A: mhm 

293.93 301.44 B: part that's been federalized with the new transportation security administration certainly there have been large numbers of people 

301.77 306.51 B: um dismissed as as airport employees at some of the major airports 

306.60 307.61 B: um 

308.12 309.78 B: mostly for for 

310.57 312.76 B: immigration violations rather than 

312.97 315.12 B: being a a specific ah 

315.28 317.62 B: ah security threat but that's 

317.86 318.81 B: ah 

319.43 322.40 B: import- relevant aspect um 

322.43 323.47 A: (( mhm )) 

322.54 324.03 B: i guess 

326.30 331.66 B: i mean of not only about baggage but about the the danger of sabotage of some type 

331.96 334.23 B: ah to aircraft 

334.24 335.73 A: mhm 

334.87 336.04 B: um 

337.18 345.78 B: i remember that from that the the november crash in new york there seemed to be some some chance of that baggage that did not turn out to be the 

346.06 347.23 A: mhm 

346.38 348.12 B: be the case but um 

349.94 350.73 B: but 

350.92 355.62 B: yes anyone who has access to secure areas of airports ah is 

355.83 357.91 A: (( [noise] )) 

356.24 357.28 B: someone 

358.04 362.00 B: that like security system needs to address in terms of of uh 

363.11 366.96 B: assuring that they're they're they're not people who who would 

367.27 368.64 B: do harm 

368.30 369.50 A: (( right )) 

370.04 373.40 A: and uh do you currently or ah 

373.58 377.58 A: use the airport um do you like using the airport 

377.90 382.59 A: uh have you used the airport since september eleven [noise] 

382.26 384.57 B: (( i've made ah )) 

385.11 389.49 B: two round trips to california since then 

389.54 390.65 B: um 

391.37 394.55 B: once for work and once 

394.65 395.89 B: on my own 

395.98 397.22 B: um 

398.96 400.37 B: i mean i'm 

401.64 405.71 B: probably less anxious to fly than before more 

405.72 408.94 B: because of the hassle factor than because of uh 

409.26 411.13 B: ah security concern 

411.21 412.73 B: (( but ah if you're )) 

412.79 414.84 B: going coast to coast ah 

415.00 420.17 B: ah there's much choice about what means of transportation ah to to to use 

419.20 420.72 A: [noise] mhm 

420.32 421.60 B: so um 

422.26 423.31 B: it probably 

424.78 430.72 B: ma- the situation makes me less anxious to fly for pleasure if i don't have a specific place to go to when i'm 

430.83 432.49 B: planning a vacation i'm 

432.55 435.58 B: likely to choose um something closer 

432.66 433.76 A: i see 

434.33 440.79 A: did you feel any more secure because of the changes did you fly before 

441.17 442.81 A: september eleven 

442.49 443.61 B: um 

444.26 447.15 B: yes um um 

447.13 455.08 A: because the only way you can really answer the question i just asked if you um have some previous experience 

447.34 448.22 B: (( sure yeah )) 

454.41 463.54 B: yeah i've flown mostly for work on on occasion i've gone i've made a trip actually to greece for the summer of two thousand and one 

463.29 464.37 A: mhm 

463.74 464.90 B: um 

467.16 468.54 B: so i mean 

468.61 476.02 B: rightly or wrongly i didn't worry about security be- before afterwards well i was aware of it as an issue but but 

476.08 480.18 B: but felt pretty pretty secure um um 

480.23 481.13 B: so in 

481.87 484.13 B: in that sense i didn't 

485.11 488.42 B: i didn't worry air travel traffic uh 

488.68 494.45 B: is basically uh uh safer than the hijacking threat and in fact 

494.46 504.28 B: the hijacking threat may be lesser now than than than ever before that is we don't these days have people who are hijacking planes for for money and that sort of thing 

503.96 505.22 A: mhm 

504.57 505.55 B: um 

506.84 510.98 B: so security as such doesn't worry me but uh 

511.68 513.49 B: probably traveling by 

513.58 517.54 B: airplane waiting in airports has become become rather less pleasant 

517.78 518.69 B: um 

519.07 522.23 B: what about you do you you you get to fly much mhm 

521.94 524.21 A: yes i i um 

524.22 530.45 A: certainly enjoy travel uh national and internationally um 

530.73 533.82 A: and i have ah flown 

533.98 539.18 A: to florida since september of eleven and um 

539.90 542.20 A: it was a very early flight 

542.30 545.38 A: and i ah found that it was very 

545.26 550.67 A: ah simple to get processed in fact i was running late and that was very silly of me 

550.52 559.28 A: but i was really lucky because the guy just checked me in from outside where i understand he shouldn't have done or he wasn't supposed to do 

559.10 570.73 A: ah within an hour of time for the plane to leave but i had only minutes so it was really nice but i was really ah cutting it close 

571.62 572.67 A: um 

573.57 580.41 A: so then you have security where situations like that uh you know um 

581.15 590.59 A: i'm not a terrorist but ah here is this woman who ah running late and why can't a terrorist ah 

591.22 600.04 A: play a role like that and there goes that bag right through ah the door because some helpful person so 

600.08 613.34 A: that's ah another um element of the system that you know is going to break down i don't ah i don't know if i feel more secure because people are are ah asking 

613.34 626.41 A: ah others or myself to take off my shoes before boarding the plane ah especially when i know that there are other people who are um not as cautious as as those people you know 

626.52 630.30 A: i didn't see much of a difference except for longer lines 

630.41 631.75 A: [laughter] 

631.36 639.07 B: [noise] yep yeah yeah the lines are are longer generally people are having to the come to the airport earlier so there are more people at the airport at any given point 

639.08 639.94 B: ah 

640.35 646.78 B: anything's but thi- this so that you were allowed to do a curbside baggage check in less than an hour before your flight 

646.37 649.64 A: yeah i probably had like 

649.87 656.71 A: maybe fifteen minutes to get on board it was really bad of me i just um 

657.43 670.71 A: it was very early flight and i just i thought taking a earlier flight would help me to avoid the long lines but i overslept and you know yada yada yada yada um 

661.26 662.16 B: yeah 

669.49 671.29 B: (( yeah i mean i know the )) 

671.85 674.47 B: concerns my inclination used to be to 

674.61 681.45 B: get early morning flights but then when i remember planning my trip to california last summer thinking 

681.73 683.42 B: well if it's a 

683.94 689.99 B: six thirty seven o'clock flight then i've got to be at the airport at four thirty five o'clock so i've got to be up 

690.19 693.16 B: three thirty or something and i don't know if i want to do this [noise] 

691.32 694.65 A: mhm [laughter] 

694.74 702.02 A: and the thing that [cough] interests me is this gentleman was more interested or or 

702.05 714.53 A: yeah he was more interested in the tip that i would give him for being such a good man and helping me than um you know um my bags you know looking um 

715.42 716.07 A: (( [noise] )) 

716.56 719.95 A: you know i don't know i just didn't feel as i-
