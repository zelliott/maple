1.56 3.18 A: hi my name's tico 

3.14 5.11 B: hi i'm julie what's your name oh 

4.96 6.48 A: tico t. i. c. o. 

6.24 7.17 B: okay 

7.22 8.17 B: how are you 

8.20 9.41 A: (( i'm good how are you )) 

9.10 10.04 B: good 

10.44 13.29 B: so what are your thoughts on airport security 

12.46 22.29 A: um i guess it's better now than it used to be i mean it used to be that i could you know like get a knife into a an airplane without much of a problem you know like even 

22.33 25.10 A: like the reasonably big one i keep on my keychain 

25.17 28.10 A: you know it's it's bigger than the than a box cutter 

28.23 30.89 A: (( and i used to you know i used to travel with it pretty frequently )) 

30.97 36.75 B: i still think i could get on with a knife though i think they only profile certain people it's what makes the new 

37.20 38.98 B: standards kind of wrong 

38.75 44.94 A: yeah yeah but i get i mean they're profiling like it's semi-legitimate you know 

45.60 47.74 A: like it is because i mean 

48.05 50.50 B: right why wouldn't i bring a knife onto a plane 

50.30 52.61 A: i don't know would you i mean 

52.96 58.95 B: i mean i don't feel see why anyone would [laughter] so like it i mean i don't see how you can profile a certain type of person 

60.56 61.48 A: (( well )) 

63.56 64.43 A: i mean 

64.73 76.19 A: empirically like all the terrorists have been arabs right so why would it you know doesn't it make sense to you know identify like oh arabs are more likely than not to be terrorists 

68.71 69.50 B: right 

77.54 80.93 B: but i think it's unfair to those arabs who are not terrorists 

82.02 91.73 A: yeah no it's somewhat unfair but like you know if they're if they're not terrorists like you know i mean right now they they still like every third person gets a has to take their shoes off and stuff 

92.03 94.62 A: so you know like it shouldn't be a huge issue 

94.82 100.00 B: i know they say every third person but i really feel like the people i seem them doing it to 

100.12 107.80 B: are definitely who meet certain profiles do you know what i'm saying like even thought it's supposedly random i don't actually observe it to be so 

103.30 104.65 A: yeah 

108.06 117.46 A: yeah i don't know i flew a lot this summer and i only got um i'm indian so i look sort of arab you know so i i only got you know i only got pulled over once 

117.77 124.04 A: and there are a lot of people like that i remember once there was old white lady was really mad because she got pulled over like had to take her shoes off and stuff 

123.75 124.69 B: uh-huh 

123.95 135.01 A: and i heard her talking at the the terminal later about how that arab and she pointed at me got to walk right through while she had she had to take her shoes off and stuff she was really angry about that 

134.35 142.39 B: [noise] [noise] well it's so interesting because like for me i've had like the opposite experience like all the times that i've flown this summer i've seen them target like 

142.54 147.64 B: only arab people or people who were like tall and had beards and things like that 

143.99 145.17 A: oh really 

147.41 148.16 A: (( oh oh )) 

147.97 154.20 B: i'm like whenever i was traveling with people like me and my friends always went through on our own 

149.40 150.17 A: (( that's )) 

153.63 157.70 A: strange i i was really worried about that because i got i spent three months in and 

157.86 158.88 B: (( this was where )) 

157.89 170.66 A: when i got back i spent three months in alaska this summer and when i got back like i hadn't shaved in three months like i hadn't cut my hair in three months so i was i was looking pretty ragged and i was just like prepared for like all sorts of trouble going through 

166.07 167.19 B: [laughter] 

170.89 178.31 A: through the the airports and i really didn't have any i'm kind of worried about like you know like anti like um profiling like 

178.47 186.18 A: airport security getting scared that oh we don't want to appear racist so we'll let you know these people through even if they do appear suspicious 

187.25 194.08 B: i actually like i don't even notice that there's been much security like the last time i went on a trip i went to texas 

193.72 194.49 A: (( uh-huh )) 

194.17 196.15 B: and i forgot to bring i._d. 

196.33 198.59 A: (( really and they let you on a plane oh )) 

196.39 197.77 B: to the airport 

197.81 199.56 B: and i got on 

199.72 200.73 A: wow 

201.50 202.78 A: that's strange 

202.43 206.12 B: i mean i was with other people and they all had i._d.s so maybe that was 

206.37 207.52 B: okay 

207.46 208.46 A: yeah 

207.60 211.78 B: but i mean i myself didn't have any i._d. i just had my ticket and i got on 

211.73 220.03 A: they wouldn't let me uh they wouldn't let me pick up my girlfriend's ticket for her even though i i had her driver's licence on me they said no she has to be here 

217.77 218.93 B: oh really 

220.71 221.59 A: (( so it's )) 

220.74 221.73 B: (( wow )) 

221.84 222.83 A: strange 

223.29 224.02 B: (( [noise] )) 

223.44 225.57 A: um 

227.50 232.00 B: so you think there has been like a good increase in security 

231.04 235.11 A: yeah well the lines are longer if nothing else i mean 

236.02 241.85 A: it seems to be harder like when i when i pick up friends at the airport i can't get into the uh i can't like meet them at the gate 

241.62 242.69 B: yeah 

241.91 243.19 A: (( because they uh )) 

243.39 245.28 A: you have to stay outside the gate which 

245.53 249.02 A: i think is pretty annoying actually but i guess it's better 

247.86 248.83 B: (( yeah )) 

248.89 252.41 B: yeah it's more annoying than i think it is safe but 

250.51 251.46 A: yeah 

251.82 255.15 A: i mean realistically i don't have any business near the airplanes 

255.31 258.36 A: so like there's no reason i should be able to walk up near them 

258.23 262.75 B: yeah i think it's sad that we have to worry about things like that 

262.28 265.31 A: (( yeah it's it's different really it's )) 

265.77 266.85 A: strange 

267.04 269.10 A: but i guess i mean like you can't even 

269.15 271.36 A: used to be i mean airplanes used to be like 

271.47 277.05 A: it feels like more fun you know you could smoke cigarettes and you know like drinks for free and now they're really like 

277.45 279.92 A: and i don't think i'm i'm 

282.03 283.07 B: oh really 

282.93 290.06 A: yeah like i think like only international only on some airlines um which i guess makes sense but 

294.99 297.19 A: um 

297.90 300.75 B: where do you do you fly to india a lot is that where you 

300.78 304.29 A: um just occasionally i haven't actually gone in several years 

304.74 305.54 A: but 

304.97 310.32 B: no i was just wondering if maybe it was just the difference between international flight security and domestic 

309.47 314.26 A: yeah oh no actually international like they're really like when you do fly them 

314.38 318.68 A: then they're like they're really strict like you have to show several forms of i._d. 

319.16 320.30 A: all these things 

319.50 324.83 B: because i've never flown internationally so maybe you know my experiences are different from yours for that reason 

324.70 326.18 A: yeah that could be it 

328.28 329.70 A: (( it's been a while yeah )) 

330.51 334.01 B: i've only flown four times since september eleventh so 

334.59 337.70 A: i i stay from i like to drive anyway 

337.95 340.32 A: but yeah i stayed away from airplanes for a while 

340.40 341.41 A: (( after that )) 

340.53 342.95 B: really because you were scared 

342.44 351.11 A: i i was yeah i was thinking well i could fly but you know i might as well drive because like i i wasn't scared of uh getting bombs but you know it was just like 

351.10 361.58 A: like the wait was longer you know like there's a hassle and like it's the kind of stress i don't need because you never really know like you know what plane is going to be targeted 

361.93 363.60 B: yeah 

362.99 368.94 A: anything i i had a friend who was on a he was on he was flying to washington and somebody stood up and that like thirty minutes 

369.41 377.44 A: thirty minutes outside of uh d._c. you're not allowed to stand up and suddenly this this old guy he sort of just got up and went to the bathroom and they had to re route the plane to a different airport 

377.81 378.86 B: (( why )) 

378.71 382.47 A: it's it's like a standard procedure when flying into reagan international now 

382.78 384.57 B: that's ridiculous so 

383.70 387.58 A: yeah if you're flying like out of reagan you can't stand up for thirty minutes until [mn] 

387.71 392.81 A: for the first three minutes or when you're flying in you can't stand up once you're thirty minutes outside the airport 

391.59 393.70 B: they had to re route the plane for that 

393.48 396.21 A: yeah they they put it into b._w._i. and 

396.22 397.29 B: wow 

396.40 404.50 A: then like you know he was at the wrong airport so he had to take a train and that cab from b._w._i. out to reagan to get his luggage and stuff 

405.20 409.46 A: so i guess like i mean in some instances like that was like a little severe you 

408.86 410.09 B: yeah 

409.67 410.47 A: (( know )) 

412.29 416.67 A: but i guess they're trying to make like regulations that people can follow rather than 

416.29 417.34 B: yeah 

416.79 418.56 A: ask people to make decisions 

418.77 419.74 B: wow 

422.36 423.84 A: what do you feel about the uh 

423.85 425.54 A: the pilots being armed 

426.51 428.93 B: um i haven't heard about that actually 

428.49 431.04 A: i don't think they passed some resolution 

429.64 431.23 B: is that is that a new issue 

431.14 438.36 A: yeah yeah about having like not like not allowing them to be armed but like regulating that pilots carry uh handguns 

438.21 441.07 B: i mean i suppose it's fine unless like the 

441.09 442.38 B: i mean i don't know 

442.31 443.26 A: (( yeah )) 

445.21 448.70 B: i guess i mean if policemen are allowed to then i don't see why 

448.43 449.84 A: (( yeah the problem it )) 

448.83 451.55 B: other authority figures shouldn't be allowed to 

451.62 457.21 A: feels strange because i mean like it's kind of like there's going to be a gun on the plane now you know and 

457.93 463.86 A: like in the ideal situation there's no gun on the plane but if pilots have guns then somebody's got a gun 

462.56 466.58 B: i guess it's better that they have one in case one of the passengers does but like 

465.79 467.40 A: (( yeah and the )) 

468.73 472.22 A: other thing that worries me is like maybe someone getting the gun away from the pilot it 

472.37 476.04 A: might happen instead of like a guy with a box cutter you've got a guy with a handgun 

474.33 482.35 B: yeah no actually that's very like statistically true that in general the people who carry weapons for self defence end up having them used against them 

484.55 486.99 B: so i guess that'll be something to keep in mind 

489.36 491.02 A: (( mm )) 

491.23 492.01 B: hello 

492.11 492.85 A: (( yeah )) 

492.63 493.60 B: oh sorry 

494.31 496.74 B: but i don't know i think 

497.05 502.63 B: a lot of the measures that have been taken as a result of the september eleventh are kind of silly 

502.77 508.24 B: just because i don't think anything like i don't really think the risk has changed since then 

508.22 515.74 A: i think i think a lot of it is just to make people feel better like there's kind of like visible like okay like security's better now you know go ahead and fly 

510.85 512.13 B: yeah 

516.31 519.08 A: because i think like the airline industry is already like in trouble 

519.97 522.68 A: in general because people aren't flying as much as they used to 

522.49 527.21 B: i know that's why i think i don't know i just think it's a little silly that people are scared all of a sudden 

527.22 533.19 B: when like there's always you know when plane crashes it doesn't even have to be a terrorist there's always been like risks involved 

532.92 533.50 A: yeah 

533.52 534.48 B: i don't know 

535.93 539.20 A: yeah i never i never really liked flying period because like 

538.62 539.53 B: what 

539.47 544.69 A: i really never fly- liked flying like period just because like you you have like zero control over what's happening 

544.78 545.87 B: yeah 

544.78 554.39 A: and you're kind of in like a precarious position you know as much as statistically it's safe like you're you know thirty thousand feet in the air you know things go wrong you don't really have much of a chance 

554.06 557.76 B: well it's a whole lot easier than like many other forms of travel 

557.44 559.33 A: yeah it is it's fast too 

560.21 562.77 B: even to like go to boston or something 

563.07 566.57 B: it it's cheaper to fly than to take amtrak from where i am 

565.67 571.96 A: yeah amtrak's just expensive for some reason it's like a it's like an eighty dollar ride to boston from philly isn't it 

572.00 573.00 B: where are you 

573.15 574.96 A: i'm in philly philadelphia 

574.74 575.85 B: okay me too 

575.82 576.81 A: yeah 

577.15 578.25 B: (( do you go to penn )) 

578.27 579.07 A: yep 

578.95 579.86 B: (( oh okay )) 

579.77 580.55 A: yeah 

581.49 582.28 A: (( do you )) 

582.43 583.23 B: what 

583.10 583.97 A: do you 

583.62 584.61 B: yes 

584.31 585.10 A: (( oh )) 

584.62 585.86 B: (( are you an undergraduate )) 

585.70 586.55 A: uh-huh 

589.29 590.28 B: but 

589.31 590.28 A: (( yeah i'm just )) 

590.61 591.78 A: how about you are you 

592.71 593.88 B: i'm a sophomore

607.62 613.39 A: i've i've just got i got one final on wednesday but i'm just kind of writing papers nonstop

624.20 626.86 A: yeah well yeah i worked for the l._d._c. briefly 

626.98 629.88 A: so i got their newsletter and i got this i don't 

628.96 629.80 B: (( oh okay )) 

630.87 632.88 B: have you experienced any like 

633.13 636.87 B: problems in terms of like being profiled for looking arab 

637.42 638.52 A: think so 

639.18 640.28 A: (( i don't know )) 

640.58 643.89 A: i'm kind of like this like non descript brown person i don't look 

643.98 645.89 A: i definitely don't look indian 

645.94 648.62 A: and i don't really look like super arab either 

648.73 649.29 B: (( mm )) 

649.35 652.07 A: i tell people i'm mexican a lot this kind of thing 

651.64 652.58 B: oh really 

652.34 653.64 A: (( yeah )) 

654.06 656.52 A: it's entertaining because i don't really have an accent 

656.33 657.48 B: yeah 

660.47 663.99 A: um yeah i can't really think of much 

664.94 668.40 B: and where have you flown to in the all the times you've been traveling this summer 

667.24 680.34 A: um mostly out west um i've got a lot of friends in san francisco and denver so it's really easy to find a cheap place out there now they've got a they've got a hundred dollar round trip to uh to denver 

680.35 681.30 B: wow 

681.67 683.67 A: yeah it's crazy i couldn't believe it 

683.64 684.78 B: on what airline 

684.91 687.95 A: (( um i think it was u._s. air )) 

688.12 689.08 B: wow 

688.53 694.12 A: i pricelined it i was kind of like i got on board i'll priceline like a ridiculously cheap you know flight 

694.82 696.36 A: so by now i don't have any 

695.22 696.95 B: i've never used priceline 

696.60 698.88 A: oh it's awesome like sometimes like 

699.01 700.76 A: a lot of times they're like you know 

700.77 703.75 A: you don't get anything but like when you hit you just like hit big 

706.16 710.05 B: so if you do priceline do you have to be prepared to like spontaneously travel 

709.88 715.75 A: no you you can say like i want to travel on this this date and i want to get back on this date this is what i've got what i'll pay 

715.88 716.46 B: (( mm )) 

717.11 719.90 A: (( the probabilities like you've got a ten percent chance of that ))
