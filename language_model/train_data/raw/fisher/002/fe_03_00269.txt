10.48 10.79 B: but 

11.99 13.20 B: anyway wh- where were you 

13.80 15.01 B: when you found out about it i guess 

14.97 17.73 A: hm i was at home getting ready for work 

18.57 20.37 A: and i have a pretty long commute so 

20.50 21.49 A: i uh 

21.62 23.80 A: listened on the radio the whole way to work 

23.96 24.67 B: oh wow 

25.40 26.10 A: and um 

27.01 30.10 A: and then listened the whole day on u- in uh internet radio 

30.97 33.36 A: while i was at work it was the whole day it was just sort of 

33.70 35.20 A: listening to the news and 

34.80 35.32 B: yeah 

35.40 36.03 A: how about yourself 

36.31 39.54 B: well i was like the first or second week of school 

40.09 43.44 B: so i was i was actually in my dorm my friend came up behind me and just 

43.65 44.38 B: and went d- 

44.86 48.88 B: (( )) the towers were attacked all this stuff and i didn't 

48.99 53.68 B: i sort of thought he was joking at first until when i got into class we were talking about it but i mean 

54.45 54.79 B: (( hello )) 

55.05 57.74 B: i like go to school across the country from where i live so it was pretty 

58.84 59.29 B: scary 

58.85 59.92 A: uh wh- where are you from 

60.14 61.02 B: i'm from california 

61.26 61.61 B: so 

61.99 62.81 A: so were you near 

62.96 63.72 A: new york when 

64.21 65.16 B: yeah pennsylvania 

65.75 67.24 A: yeah so that would probably be 

68.23 68.68 A: pretty 

68.87 70.09 A: highly charged 

70.14 72.34 B: yeah my parents flipped out ha ha 

71.66 72.37 A: ha ha ha 

72.50 73.02 B: but 

74.20 75.25 B: (( )) so i guess 

74.83 76.19 A: did you make changes 

76.33 78.36 A: since then has anything in your life changed 

79.02 82.82 B: i don't know i guess i started reading the news paper more 

82.53 83.16 A: oh really 

82.96 86.18 B: and trying to learn about i guess international issues more 

87.46 88.36 A: that's really interesting 

88.56 89.19 B: what about you 

90.03 91.82 A: i was thinking about it and i don't think that 

92.26 96.43 A: any i didn't really make any changes per se i didn't really go out my way to 

96.95 98.54 A: do things differently i think 

99.31 101.66 A: in a way i think it's somewhat and uh 

101.81 105.46 A: daily basis you know found myself saying things like well 

106.02 108.84 A: at least bombs are not falling from the sky 

107.93 108.39 B: yeah 

108.99 110.41 A: (( to the )) shrug off 

110.41 112.09 B: it puts things into perspective 

111.60 113.00 A: yeah knowing things 

113.20 115.52 A: that might have otherwise bothered me before 

115.13 115.48 B: right 

116.13 119.69 B: while i'm not sure if my you know my interest in i guess international relations is 

120.31 125.68 B: because that or because it was my first year in college you know it just happen to coincide 

123.33 123.75 A: right 

126.15 129.74 A: and when you met a lot of people in college and talk about things i think 

130.08 130.40 B: right 

130.27 132.78 A: probably being on a college campus when that happened 

133.41 135.53 A: you probably ended up talking a whole lot about it 

135.65 139.28 B: yeah it's i mean i guess it's definitely it was definitely a topic of discussion for 

139.57 142.74 B: at least a year you know i mean 

142.01 142.30 A: yeah 

144.66 145.03 B: but 

145.27 146.58 B: i don't know i guess 

146.74 149.29 B: i mean (( any of )) your political views change from it at all 

150.78 155.04 A: um not really i think uh i feel my eyes have been open somewhat to 

155.78 158.57 A: reality which is not not really pleasant 

156.76 157.13 B: yeah 

159.51 161.61 A: yeah it's the way the world works and 

162.20 162.81 A: and how 

163.45 166.08 A: it really isn't a problem that can be solved 

167.30 168.08 A: that's frightening 

168.28 168.59 B: yeah 

169.05 169.72 B: (( so it's not just )) 

169.85 172.82 B: you know (( )) it's not just a war that's going to work 

173.94 175.34 A: right and then if we have a 

175.74 179.12 A: if we live in a world were a certain country wants to be aggressive or 

180.11 184.09 A: or wants to an- annihilate another country (( )) what can you do i mean 

184.15 184.52 B: right 

184.74 185.73 A: you have no choice but 

186.54 189.85 A: to defend yourself and then people will die even innocent people 

191.42 195.39 A: but do you know people who've changed their lives you know dramatically 

195.81 197.14 A: people you know in college 

196.80 199.39 B: i don't know i mean i guess people are 

199.52 202.04 B: more aware of things like you said and 

204.77 209.69 B: i don't actually know anyone you know really well who lives in new york 

210.35 211.02 B: so i mean 

211.25 213.86 B: i would assume that either somebody was there or 

213.96 214.35 B: there 

215.14 216.48 B: (( )) they had somebody 

216.68 219.95 B: close to them who was or you know whatever if they went to (( )) it would 

220.09 221.65 B: definitely have a significant effect 

221.81 222.11 B: but 

223.24 223.68 B: i don't know 

223.81 224.91 B: ha i mean i do- i 

225.09 226.34 B: i um actually i saw this 

226.53 233.17 B: oprah show about women who's babies were being born who you know are (( wives and have met )) who's babies are being born 

230.69 231.10 A: right 

233.64 235.43 B: (( you know )) since then but who are pregnant before 

236.41 237.01 A: right 

236.69 238.84 B: i would obviously (( )) life a lot but 

239.92 245.67 A: right i think i you know in the beginning right around when it happened a lot of people were talking about how it was going to change 

245.84 246.69 A: there life and 

247.39 248.74 A: but i don't know anyone who's made 

249.16 250.47 A: really dramatic changes 

251.42 253.48 A: i think in some ways it's just kind of fate 

254.22 255.72 B: yeah but (( it is )) also 

256.10 256.71 B: (( i know i think )) 

257.32 258.95 B: yeah i mean i think (( )) you kn- 

261.12 261.57 B: (( )) 

262.03 262.34 A: right 

262.73 264.71 B: but we definitely 

265.35 269.60 B: i don't know we definitely have ha obviously more republican's views now the country does 

270.16 270.52 A: right 

270.35 271.94 B: or at least that's what's being represented 

272.31 272.64 A: right 

273.80 274.91 B: probably if (( he set foot )) 

275.25 276.39 B: i mean i don't know why 

277.29 278.25 A: are you republican 

278.69 280.31 B: i have no idea what i am 

280.01 280.67 A: heh heh heh 

280.53 280.83 B: (( heh )) 

281.01 282.70 B: no i'm not i'm not republican but 

283.42 285.53 B: i don't think i'm necessarily democrat either 

286.12 288.15 A: oh right i think in some ways the parties 

288.69 288.96 B: yeah 

289.13 292.29 A: really are not well defined and and you know in some ways they're 

292.52 293.41 A: contradictory 

294.11 294.43 B: yeah 

294.91 295.32 A: but 

294.92 295.18 B: like 

295.32 295.82 B: i don't think 

295.52 297.11 A: i just think that the whole 

297.36 299.99 A: shift to conservatism is that a fear you know the 

300.56 301.63 A: well of course we want to 

302.24 303.29 A: check their country and 

304.14 310.03 A: and and someone who stands up and and has that strong facade and we're going to go kick their butts you know that 

309.54 310.42 B: right ha 

310.64 314.34 A: that makes people feel better but in the end ha i don't know in the end if it uh 

314.91 316.21 A: really accomplishes much 

316.69 319.01 A: and we're like where is osama bin laden 

318.72 321.97 B: right because then exactly an- h- i mean obviously he's not the only 

322.12 323.76 B: problem and he was just one person and 

323.88 327.20 B: it was easy for the (( )) to focus on that but it's not 

327.88 330.35 B: i i wouldn't say that he was the main issue you know 

330.66 331.02 A: right 

331.48 334.06 A: i think i think in my my point of view has 

334.56 336.93 A: focused on you know what is the issue and that is 

337.05 338.21 A: i think it h- it has to 

338.35 339.43 A: do with the inequities 

339.69 340.37 A: uh in 

341.13 343.42 A: in living standards across the world you know the 

343.88 347.61 A: people who have lost their money versus people who have no money and never will have any money 

347.60 348.02 B: yeah 

348.25 349.15 A: and that uh 

349.64 350.71 A: you know the kind of 

351.11 353.53 A: anger and alienation and hatred that 

354.16 358.24 A: that grows grows out of feeling completely alie- alienated from 

359.02 360.01 A: you know opportunity 

360.20 363.34 B: yeah but i also believe that the same time in a lot of ways 

364.05 366.84 B: the leaders of those countries (( i mean )) even just taking saudi arabia whose 

367.01 368.46 B: supposedly our friend 

368.59 369.10 B: um 

369.45 371.93 B: i think their leader you know their leaders w- as in 

372.57 373.92 B: total luxury 

373.15 373.72 A: oh yeah 

373.91 375.00 A: oh totally right 

374.48 382.48 B: and the people and they then the people suffer and they i think they i think they sort of in a lot of ways i do believe that i mean america has a lot to do with it but i also think that 

382.63 383.16 B: a lot of 

383.28 385.64 B: anger and resentment is direct at america 

386.37 386.71 A: yes 

386.71 390.87 B: not necessarily unfairly but instead of taking you know responsibility and trying to elevate 

391.27 392.16 B: their own countries 

392.86 396.03 B: easier for people are already in lu- ha you know have luxuries 

396.21 396.55 B: to 

396.68 397.71 A: well i think the poor 

397.84 401.28 A: of and you know the suicide bombers that they're used as pawns and 

401.80 402.39 A: it's like well 

402.53 404.89 A: people who are alienated in that way can 

405.31 406.41 A: be manipulated 

406.86 411.23 A: into you know believing that well if i kill myself in this cause i'm going to 

411.76 412.38 A: you know 

412.27 415.27 B: yeah also i mean it's also taught in schools from the time they're little and they 

415.08 415.44 A: yeah 

415.57 417.46 B: yeah i think actually it's interesting that a lot of 

417.89 421.79 B: i don't know about the specific september eleventh ones but a lot of the suicide bombers are from 

422.30 425.62 B: welfare i mean in for those countries welfare families 

425.63 427.79 A: yeah this was the first time that that was the case 

428.35 428.99 B: but it wasn't 

429.54 430.63 B: (( )) that they were 

430.96 433.55 A: well but even if you're from a wealthy family and 

433.86 436.52 A: you know the whole idea of cults i'm a psychologist and 

436.86 438.01 A: you start looking at the 

438.23 439.13 A: the research on 

439.50 442.23 A: how easy it really is to brainwash people 

442.88 444.41 A: and to get them to believe 

445.37 447.21 A: wh- pretty much anything you want them to believe 

447.29 449.41 B: oh especially if they're indoctrinated from the time they're 

449.52 450.16 B: you know little 

449.65 450.01 A: right 

450.52 451.91 B: that's interesting i'm studying psychology 

452.29 453.31 A: yeah and 

453.48 455.15 A: you know it's i think that um 

455.27 456.96 A: because the world is uh 

457.28 457.93 A: you know the (( uh )) 

458.38 460.12 A: economically so imbalan- 

460.45 461.02 A: you do 

461.35 462.76 A: have these opportunities for 

463.08 465.32 A: people who are in power in these foreign countries 

466.62 471.72 A: just like in saudi arabia and the part of the world too you really manipulate what people believe 

472.49 472.85 B: (( yeah def- )) 

472.56 475.45 A: about the other side and and western europe 

476.37 479.00 A: and it really then becomes w- like i was i saw bob 

479.31 481.33 A: what is the name bill maher mar 

481.58 482.58 B: oh bill (( maher )) yeah 

482.95 486.91 A: saying (( that it's )) a cl- you know really there's a war of civilizations you know one against the other 

487.57 490.75 B: yeah it's interesting i read in different new york times (( comments )) say like 

490.88 499.60 B: thomas friedman i'm not sure if you familiar with it but he talks a lot about i mean i guess he's the middle east correspondent for the new york times and he talks a lot about how it's not you know you can't just 

501.17 504.96 B: you know do what bush is doing and (( start to say )) us against them but that it is 

505.82 506.35 B: sort of 

506.48 508.57 B: western civilization against islamic 

508.92 509.66 B: (( extremism )) 

510.61 512.16 B: because that's really i mean 

512.28 514.95 B: when it gets down to it because that's what they're trying to destroy 

515.42 517.03 B: and there has to be some way for 

517.60 518.18 B: islam 

518.42 521.95 B: for the for you know moderate muslims (( )) true muslims i guess 

522.37 522.96 B: to (( embrace )) 

523.73 524.24 B: (( )) 

525.19 525.58 B: (( )) 

525.73 526.12 B: the 

527.16 527.97 B: fundamentalism 

528.43 529.16 A: yeah yeah 

530.83 532.63 B: (( )) libraries real too 

532.99 533.31 B: how 

533.16 534.73 A: right and that's a sticky one 

534.85 535.37 A: ha ha ha 

535.06 539.59 B: ha yeah ha but i i i guess in (( senate )) sort of the whole (( )) 

536.29 536.60 A: ha ha 

540.24 540.58 B: i guess 

540.90 542.67 B: (( need anymore aware )) of everything 

543.48 547.76 B: trying to actually ha find some truth in all the ha muddiness about everything 

548.13 548.51 A: yeah 

548.89 555.50 A: i mean when when actually though we went to war against afghanistan i was essentially a pacifist you know i really did believe it wasn't 

556.27 557.65 A: you know it's never the answer 

557.71 558.02 B: right 

558.31 561.08 A: and then i can understand how other people feel differently and 

561.41 562.95 A: and i do understand why people 

563.32 567.14 A: would want to go and retaliate but in the end i just couldn't help think about 

567.45 571.06 A: (( you )) know the everyday kind of person who doesn't really have the means to 

571.27 571.93 A: control 

572.21 573.15 A: th- their lives 

573.51 573.95 B: yeah 

574.04 577.82 A: and they're you know bombs dropped from the sky onto their houses and no one cares 

578.31 579.25 B: yeah 

578.90 581.83 A: and uh you know any kind of war is going to lead to that kind of 

582.37 583.92 B: i think that it would be really 

584.10 588.20 B: (( swept )) away in (( )) we really what what should have happened was 

588.31 588.60 B: (( )) 

588.83 591.59 B: sit down and really figure out what was going on and why this 

591.76 594.00 B: you know how this happened why this happened before 

594.46 601.80 B: we just started dropping bombs if it and obviously if it came down if that became necessary i guess that's one thing you know whatever had to happen but at the same time 

602.09 602.90 B: that's not you know 

603.00 605.70 B: bombing afghanistan is not going to necessarily solve all our problems 

606.02 608.53 A: yeah or bombing i don't think bombing anything 

606.31 606.64 B: (( it was )) 

608.03 611.46 B: no right no bombing iraq is not going to solve our problems you know yeah exactly 

608.77 609.74 A: (( )) 

609.97 610.47 A: yeah 

610.85 613.95 A: oh right what about that i mean i just think i'm i'm kind of 

612.26 612.59 B: yeah 

614.70 620.61 A: i'm trying to be in denial about it but uh you know it's a it's a looming possibility that we're going to be at war in a month or so 

621.40 622.16 A: yeah it's really 

622.28 625.82 B: i'm so confused about that i don't exactly i mean i i understand that if 

626.98 628.64 B: (( )) eventually 

628.91 630.46 B: because it's similar 

630.99 635.39 B: idea of their you know (( )) the thing is i don't understand exactly why 

635.87 639.33 B: all of a sudden bush decided that there's a looming and we have to go to war 

639.58 643.01 A: right i think it has to do with an old vendetta 

643.81 646.17 A: and uh it really doesn't have any kind of 

647.50 649.10 A: an urgent you know cause 

650.16 654.65 A: and uh that's sad you know cause it's really it's about well i'm in power i can do what i want 

654.89 655.30 B: yeah 

655.44 657.86 A: and and i think essentially that's why he's doing and 

658.23 660.08 A: the economy's going down the drain and 

660.38 661.62 B: yeah ha (( )) 

661.73 663.36 B: (( )) away from that by making it worse 

663.65 671.69 A: well yeah and today i saw that the you know that algeria is going to raise the price of oil and probably the price of oil will go up if we bomb iraq you know just because of these countries 

672.23 678.27 A: well some how we suddenly supporting iraq by saying well you're going to war we're going to jack up the oil prices and then 

678.67 680.48 A: (( and )) our economy's going to suffer more 

680.96 685.16 B: well it's interesting to me is that they said bush is still mentioning saudi arabia (( as ))
