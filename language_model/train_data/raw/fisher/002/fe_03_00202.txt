26.18 38.46 B: i mean i'm in my second year of college and last year we totally didn't do this 'cause i only had one roommate and she definitely wasn't christian [laughter] but this year like all my roommates and i we got a tree we got fake pine scent to spray into the air [laughter] 

32.76 34.15 A: yeah 

37.56 41.08 A: (( oh that's so fun [laughter] )) 

39.47 42.24 B: yeah i know [laughter] but 

41.14 45.51 A: that's really fun that you have a tree while you're in college 'cause i'm actually 

43.89 47.64 B: i know it's really weird [laughter] basically one of my roommates had one 

45.70 47.42 A: yeah it's nice 

47.88 48.71 A: yes 

48.10 48.95 B: yeah 

49.05 62.59 A: well i i actually i'm a second year grad student and so i'm also moving away from home and we've been discussing whether my roommates and i are going to get a tree and i don't think we really are but it would be fun if we did [laughter] 

54.06 55.09 B: yeah 

58.04 58.90 B: yeah 

62.58 69.62 B: (( yeah my roommate like had it's fake she had one and i was like okay well put it up [laughter] ))

70.88 72.14 B: yeah yeah 

72.19 73.12 B: um 

72.38 78.25 A: i think i think christmas is probably my favorite holiday just in general anyway i think 

78.26 86.23 A: um yeah you get together with lots of different people and you know it seems like it's just a really just a really nice time 

86.41 91.43 B: yeah i i um definitely really like christmas because 

91.63 100.80 B: i mean i know all of the commercialized things have you know happened and made it very commercialized all that stuff but ah 

100.83 107.71 B: it really [laughter] all the carols and just seeing people being happy and in a giving mood 

104.58 105.56 A: (( uh-huh yeah [laughter] )) 

105.75 106.77 A: (( yes yes )) 

107.56 112.20 A: it's true people do they are in so much of a giving mood this time of year like 

111.75 112.96 B: (( yeah mm )) 

112.29 123.18 A: some of my friends and i we did this thing called operation christmas child i don't know if you've ever heard of that but you make boxes and you put all kinds of little toys and little candies in there 

123.02 124.08 B: yeah 

123.05 127.87 A: and then you ma- they mail them to um kids in third world countries who don't 

127.94 129.79 A: (( even really have anything )) 

129.77 130.91 B: yeah 

130.57 143.30 A: and it is like you know 'cause normally we don't take the time to do that sort of thing you know i mean it's alw- always good to do that but you don't even necessarily think about it unless you know someone reminds you and when you get close to christmas you know you're like oh i 

139.33 140.11 B: right 

143.61 146.07 A: people are they're much more giving i think yeah 

146.26 151.91 B: yeah like i just always remember [laughter] when i was in church when i like in sunday school and 

151.69 153.24 A: uh-huh yeah 

151.81 165.96 B: stuff um they'd give us instead of like you know the advent calendars with the chocolate in and stuff they'd give us they'd give us ones at church that were like you put a quarter in for every day and then you'd hand them in on christmas eve you know 

156.75 157.78 A: yeah 

163.11 164.06 A: uh-huh 

165.82 166.81 A: okay 

165.86 166.93 B: and um 

166.92 173.33 B: and you'd they'd give them to uh some charity it was one one specific charity i can't remember which 

173.18 178.95 B: and um i remember just around christmas i'd be so excited and every day i'd like try and find a quarter 

173.33 174.15 A: uh-huh 

178.78 187.07 B: or like find one in my change box and always wanna put it in [laughter] so it was just like even then i just wanted to 

182.15 183.68 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

186.37 187.57 A: yeah 

186.91 196.10 B: you know do stuff like that i i was like wow i'm gonna with a quarter i can make all this money with this one sheet and all these days and give it to people 

189.26 190.79 A: yeah 

193.98 194.90 A: (( i know )) 

195.89 200.52 A: yeah that's funny [laughter] well i remember i can't remember was it for 

196.94 198.86 B: [laughter] 

200.31 215.07 A: christmas or i think this one might be for easter but we used to get like the rice bowls at my church that you would take home and the same type of thing like you would put your dimes and your quarters in there and you felt like you were helping so much and i think that they even had statistics on the side like 

208.86 209.92 B: yeah 

215.00 225.26 A: [mn] one dollar will feed a family of four for a month or you know something ridiculous and you're like how is that possible that you know my spare change can really do all so much for someone 

215.53 216.42 B: (( yes )) 

220.77 222.25 B: yeah exactly 

224.54 225.48 B: right 

226.32 227.20 A: yeah 

226.53 227.77 B: yeah 

228.14 234.31 B: um i don't know i always liked also before like thanksgiving [laughter] because um 

228.36 229.05 A: (( anyway )) 

234.56 245.17 B: [lipsmack] they l- because it i don't know it's always it always seems like you can get together with like i mean get together with my family and then friends and we um 

243.43 244.42 A: yeah 

245.50 246.82 B: we always 

247.54 257.92 B: and but since there's no gifts and no pressure to get gifts it's always a different kind of spirit too and then it leads into the christmas spirit [lipsmack] that's that's cool too 

250.87 252.00 A: right 

253.33 254.17 A: yes 

255.54 256.94 A: that's true 

257.68 263.09 A: that is nice it's nice yeah 'cause there's not so much pressure i mean with christmas it just gets crazy 

258.09 258.90 B: (( [laughter] )) 

260.98 262.61 B: right 

262.93 267.55 B: yeah [noise] it's a different type of thing [laughter] 

266.78 281.22 A: it is it is yeah and christmas lasts so long it seems like every year the celebrations start earlier and like i just had a christmas party last week i think and we still have what almost a month before christmas three weeks at least so 

268.48 269.13 B: (( yeah )) 

270.47 271.35 B: yeah 

273.40 274.20 B: yes 

279.29 280.11 B: yeah 

280.66 281.45 B: yeah 

281.24 294.85 A: yeah people are crazy like that [lipsmack] and then of course it sometimes is touchy because like you were saying not everyone is christian and so you can't always say that it's a christmas party it might have to be a holiday party or something like that so 

288.52 289.26 B: right 

292.86 294.08 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

294.91 303.62 A: [laughter] yeah and that is something that's nice at thanksgiving is that you can put like you know everyone is going to be celebrating thanksgiving in in this country yeah 

300.69 302.19 B: right yeah 

303.60 304.55 B: (( yeah and )) 

304.58 319.10 B: i mean even if like my my um parents aren't from this country and like and the reason we visit um our family and friends every year is because like all my relatives live in england and all theirs do too and it's just a different kind of family and it's um 

318.25 319.57 A: (( uh-huh right )) 

319.27 329.09 B: and even if you're not from here originally you can get into the spirit because it's giving thanks or getting together and just you know using like 

325.64 326.42 A: (( yes )) 

328.21 329.35 A: (( [mn] absolutely )) 

329.13 331.40 B: (( giving thanks for what you've got and stuff like that )) 

331.24 332.82 A: yeah 

331.76 333.68 B: [laughter] 

332.97 336.20 A: one of my roommates is uh from canada 

336.33 337.27 B: mhm 

336.49 340.22 A: and they have thanksgiving also but they do it in october 

340.27 341.47 B: yeah 

340.64 344.48 A: a- and i really think it's kinda funny because they don't really 

344.79 349.31 A: have a the story like with the pilgrims and everything i mean i i guess that's why they 

349.57 358.15 A: started celebrating thanksgiving it's probably the same reason that we do but it's just different because we put a lot of emphasis i think on the history behind it and everything 

358.15 371.58 A: and she doesn't even really know the history behind canadian thanksgiving you know it's just kind of a nice time to give thanks and you know eat turkey and [laughter] you know that type of thing so it is kinda nice because even if you 

358.30 359.18 B: yeah 

365.06 366.00 B: right 

371.61 376.67 A: (( don't have the actual history you can still everyone can give thanks you know that's something that's very )) 

376.16 377.84 B: yeah it's that's very true 

378.99 380.62 B: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

379.74 383.98 A: [lipsmack] yes so if you could invent a new holiday what holiday would you invent yeah 

384.69 385.74 B: um 

386.10 388.82 B: [sigh] i don't know it's hard i mean 

389.02 390.45 B: i think 

390.49 398.37 B: it would be more along the lines of a thanksgiving holiday as opposed to a a let's 

395.40 396.41 A: right 

398.57 405.79 B: get presents for everyone we know and do something like that but i'm not sure what i would call it or anything [laughter] 

400.95 402.04 A: yeah 

402.50 403.88 A: yeah 

405.06 407.55 A: (( yeah mm )) 

407.99 418.39 A: maybe it could be some time other than the winter because it seems like in the winter there's so many holidays i mean you know you have christmas which is huge and then thanksgiving which is so close to christmas 

411.65 412.66 B: yeah 

414.25 415.25 B: (( yes )) 

418.04 426.30 B: yeah it's true i think maybe a spring holiday because i i there's stuff like uh what is there 

426.20 434.31 B: may day and stuff like that for like the celebration of spring but to me spring's really nice and it would be nice to celebrate it coming along you know 

428.15 429.49 A: yeah 

429.81 431.05 A: yeah 

433.86 435.73 A: that's true that's true 

435.86 436.66 B: so 

436.57 440.12 A: 'cause there's easter but then once again not everybody celebrates easter 

439.47 440.71 B: exactly 

440.70 450.02 A: and it varies too depending on you know what year it is sometimes it's so early that it's snowing on easter [laughter] depending on where you are i guess but 

444.24 446.12 B: yeah yeah 

446.98 448.00 B: [laughter] 

449.37 458.39 B: and depending on which uh if you [mn] which kind of like christianity you pr- practice too if you do pick different easters [laughter] 

456.00 457.26 A: right 

457.65 466.29 A: that's true that's true i've never actually met anyone who i i is it like the greek orthodox or something where they celebrate it on a different day 

464.46 465.78 B: yeah 

466.57 468.34 A: so yeah that could be 

468.43 470.67 A: that could get complicated [laughter] 

470.20 484.53 B: [noise] yeah actually um my uh dad works with a couple of people who are i think greek orthodox and so they kinda want easter time off at a different time sometimes and stuff like that 

483.21 484.63 A: right 

484.54 485.49 B: so 

485.04 490.19 A: yeah i feel sorry for people like that yeah or like people who are jewish and then in september 

485.67 486.56 B: different 

490.06 492.31 A: with rosh hashanah and yom kippur 

491.85 492.82 B: mhm 

492.16 506.40 A: you know that's always when classes are s- just getting going and yeah you're really getting into the mainstream you know you might have tests and stuff but and you know there's no holiday for christians anymore around there 

500.43 501.30 B: yeah 

505.98 506.91 B: right 

506.29 513.77 A: and you know so it's i think it's probably really hard on them if they're away from their families and they can't celebrate and that sort of thing 

510.17 511.05 B: yeah 

513.99 516.96 B: yeah actually i i remember in um [mn] 

517.15 518.66 B: when i was in 

519.10 524.54 B: elementary school my when i was in third grade they actually started um 

525.14 534.69 B: [mn] we were k- we have a som- medium jewish population in my town so they started giving us rosh hashanah and yom kippur off and it was really interesting i mean 

531.85 532.77 A: (( uh-huh oh )) 

534.46 535.63 A: yeah 

535.04 536.58 B: because i 

536.86 549.91 B: i had always known about hanukkah but i'd but i'd never known that that was kind of secondary in that these two holidays were much more important and um kind of when they started giving them off it was something that um 

539.01 540.07 A: right 

544.66 546.03 A: yeah 

550.02 552.85 B: i realized and that i 

551.68 552.76 A: yeah 

553.19 556.34 B: saw but [laughter] that was just one of my [laughter] 

554.76 556.13 A: yeah 

556.47 561.62 A: yeah well whenever um the school where i went to undergrad there were also quite a few 

562.04 569.19 A: jewish people and we didn't get class off on those days but there was a rule that um professors couldn't give tests on those days 

569.10 570.13 B: yeah 

569.53 581.88 A: so that that way if people did wanna leave or go home or say go celebrate somewhere you know at least they wouldn't be missing a test they could just you know get the notes from someone or whatever which i thought that was a really reasonable rule because then 

581.78 589.83 A: you know it doesn't shut down the whole campus for just a few people but at the same time you know if you wanna leave it's totally not a problem at all yeah 

584.65 585.61 B: right 

587.34 588.05 B: (( it )) 

589.40 592.89 B: (( yeah it's as long as they respect like the )) 

592.91 597.87 B: holidays that are important i think it's that's a good thing i think we 

598.01 604.10 B: i think i don't know if we can't give tests if professors can't give tests but i know they're definitely excused absences 

604.17 605.26 A: right 

604.33 608.24 B: if that's the case if that matters or if you know stuff like that 

607.03 609.15 A: yeah yeah 

608.58 609.46 B: (( mm [noise] )) 

609.49 613.95 A: it was kinda funny for me this past year around easter because um 

613.99 624.42 A: [lipsmack] we- i guess at i guess at my college there were a lot of they were very considerate of people's religions or something because we got the jewish holidays where you wouldn't necessarily have to take tests and then 

624.33 634.87 A: for we also got good friday off right before easter and i think we even got holy thursday off um so that was really really great so everyone would always just go home for easter or whatever 

630.02 630.94 B: mhm 

634.74 635.68 B: mhm 

634.92 640.96 A: and then now um i'm at a different school and we don't get any time off at all for easter 

640.79 641.83 B: yeah 

641.49 646.58 A: and i remember i had class like on good friday and i was thinking you know i really 

646.35 659.91 A: don't wanna go to class like i and i'm sure i probably could've gotten out of it and it probably wouldn't have been a big deal at all but i ended up going after all just 'cause you know it's kind of a pain if you have to miss and especially that late in the semester 

659.97 661.01 B: yeah 

660.10 662.95 A: i would've gotten behind it was a math class so 

662.80 663.59 B: right 

663.43 665.71 A: you know it was kinda difficult but 

665.73 669.44 A: like it almost made yeah it almost made me feel like you know 

665.78 666.83 B: yeah i mean 

669.49 675.55 A: 'cause normally christians are not the ones in that position you know usually it's like a jewish person or someone more a minority 

672.66 673.52 B: right 

675.60 679.54 B: yeah i last year actually we um 

680.07 682.94 B: didn't officially get good friday off and 

682.97 695.00 B: [sigh] but it just so happened that it was our spring break um but this year i don't think we get it off and it's really weird i mean i've never had school in my life on good friday i've always gone to at least a service on thursday night or 

685.98 687.32 A: right 

691.75 693.24 A: yeah 

694.91 699.86 B: friday day and it's really weird not that you can't do that but yeah 

695.04 696.30 A: yeah 

696.38 698.47 A: yeah yeah 

700.09 709.38 B: it's it's interesting i mean 'cause usually as you said we're not uh christians are not like in that position and it's a taste of a different thing [laughter] 

700.20 701.32 A: it's different though 

709.04 713.15 A: yeah yeah it really is it's funny how that works [lipsmack] 

713.54 715.74 B: yeah but 

716.24 718.66 B: i mean and then there's other holidays 

716.31 717.29 A: when i went 

718.91 719.90 A: uh-huh 

719.22 719.96 B: like
