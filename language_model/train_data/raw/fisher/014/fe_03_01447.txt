125.51 128.57 B: he wasn't at uh work that particular day 

128.60 141.05 B: um so i have a little bit of um you know it touched a little bit too close so it was it was probably one of the most frightening days of my life because i just didn't know what was going to happen after that

160.74 161.54 B: (( wow )) 

162.38 167.54 A: so i just heard from yesterday as a matter of fact last night when me with all my friends right 

167.71 170.78 A: man look this is easy way to make money all you got to do is like [laughter] 

170.90 172.48 A: talk to people 

172.07 177.36 B: yeah no matter how old you are you're there's ways to make money and it's always you know helpful 

177.39 187.30 B: i put a little bit mo- i put money into the budget by doing this kind of thing too i'm not real comfortable talking with people i don't know all the time but it it hasn't been too bad is this your first call 

187.20 188.31 A: yeah 

187.75 190.50 B: yeah this is my second i did one yesterday 

190.95 193.74 A: all right well you you get ten dollars per call don't you 

193.42 194.62 B: pardon me 

194.26 196.45 A: you get ten dollars for a call don't you 

195.52 197.22 B: yes mhm 

197.00 199.77 A: heck huh have you got any money yet 

199.47 208.57 B: no 'cause my first one was just yesterday so um i'm hoping that i can get um another call real quick and then you know within a couple of weeks have the check 

208.65 211.76 A: well how often do they send out the checks 

211.37 216.38 B: i don't know they probably do them in batches you know at certain times of the month i would guess 

216.50 218.07 A: yeah probably 

216.68 218.16 B: but i'm not sure 

219.02 219.99 B: i'm not 

219.15 223.38 A: don't really if they waited till you had like two hundred dollars that'd suck but 

223.39 225.04 B: no i don't think they do no 

225.08 238.57 B: when i signed up i understood that it was just three calls and then if they um you know if you reregister or something like that you can go for a further uh additional calls but from i i'm just expecting three calls and then 

238.91 240.86 B: hopefully my check'll be in the mail 

241.22 247.65 A: yeah well i got one earlier but i was getting my haircut and i i hung up on it and i wonder if that counts as one of my three calls 

243.97 244.86 B: oh 

247.12 256.46 B: no it won't as a matter of fact yesterday when i got a call um i did my phone call with somebody and then about oh maybe about thirty minutes later 

249.48 250.04 A: (( [mn] )) 

256.37 262.71 B: i got another call but i thought you could only do one call a day but you you can take more than one call per day 

262.61 263.83 A: oh really 

263.28 265.35 B: (( yeah as long as you )) 

264.08 265.40 A: (( so potential is )) 

265.59 266.43 B: what 

266.33 268.81 A: you have potential to make a lot of money then 

268.34 271.83 B: yeah i would think so if they're you know if they're interested in 

272.17 276.33 B: you know the demographics of how you fit into what that whatever they're trying to study 

276.67 281.62 A: yeah i wonder what they're what the benefit is i wonder what they're trying to accomplish 

281.18 293.81 B: yeah well you know when i was looking on the internet um i heard some other people talking that uh they have gotten paid from these kinds of studies from the university of pennsylvania so i'm i'm pretty confident that we should get paid 

293.78 294.95 A: that's cool 

294.42 297.50 B: yeah so are you having all your friends do this too 

297.62 298.63 A: yep 

298.20 301.94 B: i'm trying to get my husband to do it but he's not interested 

301.63 311.34 A: yeah all my friends i mean gee we don't have anything else to do we're sitting here thinking of ways last night to make money and this is a little better than just begging ha 

310.81 312.52 B: [laughter] 

311.77 316.67 A: just go up to people and war- just make up some little story and say i need a dollar 

317.03 318.26 B: (( [laughter] ))

321.78 325.10 B: [laughter] yeah you don't want to do that [laughter] 

324.43 331.82 A: get a like whip the cap on the little brother and take his picture and like say we got to have like expenses for medical bills 

332.38 335.67 A: we can put up little coffee cups all over town and 

335.89 337.09 A: collect the money 

336.76 342.04 B: yeah i seen people do that and i always hope that they're legit but probably not huh 

342.18 344.90 A: yeah i i don't give nobody like that money 

344.36 347.94 B: yeah no i don't either i'm not a sucker for that kind of thing

453.64 462.93 A: yeah for for nine eleven i remember that day i went and bought a bunch of gas before football practise just 'cause i thought that the gas prices were going to skyrocket 

462.38 463.44 B: mhm 

464.01 465.98 A: and uh they didn't really 

465.61 469.65 B: yeah were you at home when you first found out about it

475.63 476.50 B: oh 

480.25 483.10 A: and talked to him for a second and then he had to go 

481.78 482.60 B: yeah 

483.81 487.76 A: and uh they were on like doing fight patrol and stuff 

487.26 494.70 B: mhm well as horrible as it was you really couldn't help but watch it on t._v. 'cause you really just wanted to know everything that was going on 

488.00 488.95 A: so 

495.03 496.28 B: don't you think 

496.03 498.75 A: yeah but i mean i'm i'm kinda i 

498.93 506.32 A: can handle that kind of stuff really well i was just pissed off at the fact that they had gotten a blow in on us you know what i mean 

501.07 501.98 B: yeah 

505.86 507.63 B: yeah exactly 

506.62 512.62 A: just seeing our pentagon going up in smoke and our two american buildings on the ground 

513.16 516.17 A: pissed me off to be honest i mean that's the bottom line 

514.97 527.10 B: yeah i yeah i i felt that too i was i was more scared than anything because i have an eleven year old son and and um my first reaction was to want and go and get him and keep him safe 'cause you know you never 

526.99 530.01 B: i just didn't know what else might be in store 

530.11 533.09 B: you know that they might be coming to niagara falls or something 

533.09 537.38 A: yeah i mean no one expected they'd land in pennsylvania i 

533.50 535.13 B: and and doing something 

536.91 538.42 B: right exactly 

538.69 539.51 B: so

545.24 546.19 B: no 

546.30 551.83 A: but i i went i went to football practise that day just 'cause i knew that there wouldn't of been no reason not to 

551.25 555.02 B: yeah did they um let you talk about it at school 

555.17 561.89 A: oh yeah yeah we watched it on t._v. and talked about it and it was we had discussions wrote papers about it and stuff like that 

556.96 557.95 B: yeah 

561.32 562.69 B: yeah 

562.09 565.00 A: there's no reason not to as far as we were concerned 

563.43 564.32 B: no 

564.82 569.97 B: well for the for the younger kids and like i said my son's eleven they really didn't um 

569.94 583.37 B: want to expose that to to to expose them to that again and again at school so i guess they just expected the parents to to talk about it at home but there were an awful lot of scared little kids you know they didn't know what was going on either 

578.24 579.29 A: yeah 

583.37 586.78 A: yeah at my high school i mean you got to realize there was only
