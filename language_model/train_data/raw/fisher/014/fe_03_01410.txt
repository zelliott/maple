3.16 4.79 A: great great 

4.39 7.41 B: um so i guess the topic is september eleventh 

7.23 12.24 A: okay yes can i ask a real quick question what company is this for [laughter] 

9.65 10.56 B: sure 

11.59 13.09 B: what company 

12.50 13.79 A: yeah the 

14.22 16.67 B: what the survey or wh- uh 

15.42 16.31 A: (( yeah )) 

16.69 20.43 B: i just know it's a study through the university of pennsylvania 

19.92 22.66 A: oh oh okay i know what this is now then okay 

22.20 24.33 B: oh you do a lot of these or 

23.81 26.34 A: no no i i remember signing up now 

25.99 27.12 B: (( oh okay )) 

26.64 29.64 A: okay so what changes have i made since september eleventh 

30.74 34.33 A: i'm well i'm a little more cautious 

33.82 35.01 B: yeah 

34.44 37.31 A: um not taking plane rides 

37.10 39.08 B: do you not fly at all or 

38.68 42.73 A: um well there's been a couple of times we have decided not to 

42.66 43.57 B: really 

43.60 45.59 A: because of well 

45.70 49.78 A: one right after it happened and one recently because of the war 

50.20 53.96 B: but but you you haven't decided not to fly at all 

53.53 55.52 A: no no we haven't made that decision 

54.86 57.46 B: but just because of the timing of the two 

57.09 58.19 A: right 

57.57 64.32 B: flights you had um but i guess you're you're more a little more cautious about when you're gonna fly 

64.17 65.06 A: right 

64.68 72.51 B: i mean as far as myself um i'm kinda young so um i flew right after september eleventh actually like 

72.57 82.43 B: the first week in october um and i've flown a bunch since then i mean i'm not i don't not do it but i'm definitely more aware of you know 

82.49 85.97 B: feel- you know i mean you can't help but think about it when you're on a plane ride 

85.81 86.74 A: right 

86.09 96.50 B: um sometimes but uh i mean i've flown probably at least five or six times since september eleventh and once actually just recently during the war i went to uh to europe which 

96.47 97.57 A: oh really 

96.55 99.99 B: which was a little scary at first but um 

99.82 114.48 B: you know i mean i sort of i sort of like to go by you know the theory like if something's gonna happen it's gonna happen i mean you you do what you can and minimize the risk you're in but i'm not gonna you know live in fear and stop you know going out all together 

112.11 113.06 A: right 

114.53 122.58 B: um but uh you know i mean i guess i guess everybody sort of thinks twice you know on plane rides you know onc- since it happened um 

122.67 133.17 B: i guess the other thing is you know you sort of just i mean i go to um school at the university of maryland which is uh you know pretty close to d._c. about seven miles 

132.77 133.79 A: mhm 

133.19 146.74 B: so being that close like we hear things all the time you know about threats or you know one day i think a couple of weeks ago they said you know don't go into d._c. on friday you know they think something's gonna happen so it's i mean being in that area it's sort of like a constant 

146.73 158.17 B: you know stuff might happen so you know you're aware but you know i mean every time they like raise a terror alert you know i can't i don't really like go into hiding or anything like that 

157.66 159.36 A: well neither do we we 

158.68 160.23 B: yeah 

159.50 163.83 A: um have you changed the way you do thing financially since then 

163.67 165.56 B: financially what do you mean 

164.73 169.11 A: i mean just not spending as much money because of the economy 

168.95 183.19 B: um i mean i would say probably not i think that for me since i'm in college it just sort of you know depends on you know the money i have [laughter] at the moment um so i don't i'm not really at a point where i can you know uh 

183.28 187.90 B: spend more spend less to you know help the economy or or to save it just sort 

187.80 199.86 B: you know not driven by that but um i would say like i mean also being close to d._c. you know when it happened you know i knew a couple of people that had relatives that died um as well as well as like plenty of people that 

196.94 198.04 A: (( mm okay )) 

199.83 214.63 B: you know had uh parents that worked at the pentagon or you know world trade center and so you know just being around them you know you sort of you sort of think more about you know th- people that are close to you and sort of you know maybe things that you wouldn't have thought about as much 

214.74 220.27 B: you i at least i sort of think about more you know just 'cause you know you never know what what can happen 

220.06 222.99 A: it seems like it was closer to you than i'm in ohio 

222.35 223.60 B: oh you're in ohio 

223.38 226.71 A: so yeah it didn't it didn't affect me as much as it might have 

225.82 228.24 B: yeah that was the interesting thing because i mean i was 

228.07 242.74 B: you know i was right there and it was like i mean it was a you know a big obviously story for everybody in the country but like for us it was sort of like a local story like this is or at least the pentagon part of it you know this is happening in our backyard and you know our our school like 

238.48 239.55 A: right 

242.57 250.69 B: we closed the next day and you know people thought maybe they would target our school you know 'cause we're a big college campus and you know um 

250.73 256.94 B: so it just sort of like you know i mean i was just saying i was on another one of these calls with somebody uh 

257.05 260.63 B: um it's for me being you know being young being twenty one like 

260.86 264.14 B: before september eleventh i mean really never had 

264.02 266.00 B: like any kind of war 

265.84 276.86 B: you know that would make me think so this is the first thing really that you know before i was sort of like a peaceful and you know prosperous time to me you know growing up as a young person and then 

276.65 289.39 B: after september eleventh it was really a dramatic shift in just how i think about you know the world and what can happen you know because i had never you know really been forced to you know have been confronted with something like that before i 

289.02 290.02 A: right 

289.44 304.12 B: mean people of you know older people you know of course have pearl harbor and things like that but for peop- people my age growing up it was like the first thing that really you know sort of caused you to think and you know realize that you know noth- the sort of uh 

304.35 308.77 B: you know minute details of your life aren't as important as some other things 

308.16 317.99 A: you know it's funny though i'm a i'm a i'm in my thirties and this was totally the september eleven's probably the biggest thing that happened in my life as well 

311.42 312.42 B: mhm 

317.54 318.65 B: yeah 

318.07 322.13 A: because we had other than i think vietnam there wasn't too many 

322.84 323.85 A: nothing 

323.86 325.29 A: catastrophic like this 

324.90 327.82 B: yeah i mean i don't think there's really ever [laughter] been anything like 

327.19 328.17 A: no 

327.77 335.64 B: like it i mean you know asides from i mean just of you know on american soil you know of that you know randomness of 

335.47 343.76 B: you know innocent people killed and just you know total you know destruction i don't think has ever been 

343.80 346.74 B: you know witnessed so i mean i mean nobody really knew 

346.65 352.99 B: you know how to react or what to do or you know what to change i mean i know a lot of people have said um 

352.82 367.50 B: you know they got more patriotic i mean i'd say i was a little bit but like i remember i came home and you know my parents had an american flag in the window which is like something they've never ever done before but you know i guess right after september eleventh that was 

367.44 375.63 B: you know what people were doing they want- it meant something else having an american flag you know than before so i guess you know that was one way 

371.08 372.14 A: right 

375.69 388.71 B: uh but i mean even you know almost two years later like i thin- i would say it's still you know i still think i mean you still hear you know reference to it you know there's still you know major affects of it even this long later um so i mean i don't know 

388.67 393.60 A: well its affected our our family financially because my husband owns a small business 

392.98 394.06 B: oh really 

393.72 397.11 A: and after september eleventh um 

397.32 400.12 A: there was a dramatic decrease in our business 

399.56 401.40 B: what what kind of business is he 

400.54 401.99 A: he's a graphic artist 

401.65 402.78 B: (( in oh okay )) 

402.01 404.55 A: and it's just people cut advertising 

404.75 414.41 A: um it was kinda a trickle down effect from other things big companies that had been hit harder didn't use use us for advertising and now um 

408.87 409.89 B: yeah 

415.62 419.95 A: our financial life is a whole lot different than it was two years ago 

419.50 420.86 B: yeah 

420.20 426.46 A: um we have to be much more careful and we we think a lot more before we buy anything 

426.18 427.03 B: (( mm )) 

426.95 432.62 A: because of because of that and before that we had never had anything like that happen to us 

432.56 444.51 B: yeah i think al- like i also um have worked at a few newspapers as um and you know you just see i mean even looking at jobs you know for places i apply or you know whatever people are 

433.46 434.34 A: so 

444.32 458.88 B: you know have less openings than before and i mean it's just as far as the economy i think you know everything i mean it was so good for you know so long and then something like this hap- it's just such a dramatic shift that you know some people weren't prepared some people you know were just like 

452.11 453.10 A: right 

459.48 462.91 A: and we live in a big manufacturing town we we 

461.60 463.53 B: oh really where where in ohio 

463.06 464.06 A: toledo 

463.62 464.69 B: (( oh okay )) 

464.34 465.42 A: so we have 

465.44 469.18 A: lots of factories here and there is a huge amount of people 

469.33 470.21 A: um 

470.51 472.84 A: have who have lost their jobs recently 

472.58 473.65 B: mhm 

473.06 479.86 A: and they think that that's also a trickle down um because those people aren't selling cars and 

479.87 480.71 A: um 

480.87 486.06 A: it just seems and it might be partially the war too i'm not sure but um 

484.81 495.21 B: yeah i mean it it certainly hasn't gotten better i mean you know maybe people have people i guess usually think war you know helps the economy of production but i don't know that it that it has 

494.05 496.36 A: i don't think it's helped anything [laughter] 

495.57 500.97 B: so much this time actually i have a good friend of mine goes to school out in uh boulen green
