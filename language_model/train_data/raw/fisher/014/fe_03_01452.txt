10.36 11.78 A: nice to meet you too 

11.63 17.99 B: um i understand our topic today is september eleventh and changes we have made 

17.69 18.74 A: yes 

18.95 20.12 B: um 

22.31 23.69 B: i um 

24.81 29.44 B: actually we've made some changes in regards to that um 

31.11 41.02 B: it really opened our eyes i think in america as far as the type of security we have we've always had freedom 

35.06 35.62 A: (( [mn] )) 

41.28 46.78 B: and now our freedom has been threatened and i think you know there's been a lot of 

46.56 58.21 B: changes across the united states but on a personal basis i think i've become more aware of who's around me and what they're doing [laughter] um i don't know about you um 

58.90 62.65 B: i guess i've become a little more suspicious of some people 

63.39 64.44 B: um 

64.72 68.97 B: we've probably prepared ourself for 

69.01 72.25 B: some sort of disaster i've you know 

72.35 76.12 B: kept aside extra water and things like that um 

76.22 78.79 B: in case of terrorist attacks 

79.38 82.41 B: um have you done something similar or 

81.89 88.96 A: you know we really haven't changed that much other than you know explaining to our kids 

89.22 93.34 A: you know that things can happen you know explaining more 

93.40 95.97 A: than what we had explained before 

95.74 96.83 B: mhm 

96.03 97.30 A: because 

97.46 101.72 A: you know we we live day by day we know 

102.02 105.39 A: exactly where we're going to be if we do die 

105.56 109.75 A: and you know it's not a worry for us to do any 

109.87 110.84 A: you know 

110.94 115.41 A: preparation as far as like water or anything like that 

115.00 116.18 B: mhm 

117.30 123.59 B: i guess i'm probably more aware of it because we have um [lipsmack] the n._o._r._a._d. facility here 

123.62 129.03 B: we have military bases ah the air force academy and fort carson 

128.83 129.91 A: right 

129.21 132.80 B: and the n._o._r._a._d. facility of course tracks 

132.85 134.92 B: [mn] via satellite 

135.21 136.25 B: um 

136.44 138.38 B: for the northern hemisphere 

138.97 145.46 B: and they do a lot of tracking for the military plus ah secure communications and that type of thing so 

145.67 153.62 B: i guess it maybe has hit closer to home here [noise] because we do have military people and it has affected a lot of 

154.06 156.84 B: of the families that i know 

156.80 161.48 A: yeah well you know it's affected a lot of our families too but 

157.28 159.53 B: um just on a personal basis 

161.70 166.89 A: you know we know that you know this is something that is going to happen 

166.93 168.02 B: yes 

167.44 170.27 A: and and we knew that you know 

170.31 182.06 A: in the end times that these things were going to start happening we didn't know exactly what would happen but we do know that things are going to get worse at times 

181.98 185.06 B: yes i agree with that and 

185.26 187.69 B: yeah i mean it's just awful 

187.76 190.90 B: what happened to those people on september eleventh 

191.03 191.81 B: i mean 

191.09 194.29 A: yes it was but you know it was 

194.39 199.74 A: you know it could happen to anyone it could happen in a flat level house or 

199.90 205.18 A: you know anything like that you know it's they just happened to target a very 

201.70 202.40 B: yep 

205.82 216.21 B: well that's because they're terrorists and they go where they know it's gonna make the most impact and affect the most people and they certainly did that 

207.93 208.90 A: yes 

213.49 214.61 A: right 

215.09 216.54 A: yes they did 

216.56 223.03 B: and um i don't know how you feel about the war in iraq at this point but 

223.47 224.45 B: um 

225.46 228.71 B: my personal feeling is i hope that 

229.02 230.90 B: saddam is gone 

231.18 238.36 B: and his sons as well and i don't wish that to happen to anyone but i truly believe he's one of the leaders of the pack 

238.05 239.18 A: yeah 

238.58 244.05 B: and was working with osama bin laden and you know 

244.60 247.67 B: once you get rid of some of these people the 

247.70 254.51 B: the people in iraq have been suppressed for years and years and years and they have a right to freedom just as well as we do 

254.53 255.59 A: (( yes )) 

255.02 260.53 B: and i hope that they can get it together and have a strong country 

261.16 265.51 A: yes and i'm sure that they'll at least do some improvements 

261.50 262.77 B: after all 

265.94 276.06 A: but you know as far as myself i you know i i really we have not really changed other than since the gas prices have jumped so high 

275.56 276.92 B: mhm 

276.30 279.32 A: lately we have not really changed 

280.07 281.32 A: anything 

280.87 283.32 B: do you find you're driving less maybe 

283.14 285.88 A: no not really because 

284.54 286.62 B: i don't think we are either 

286.68 287.56 B: um 

286.70 288.54 A: because you know the 

288.79 295.85 A: the gas prices are from the war but see the war is from nine eleven and 

294.76 295.55 B: yep 

296.27 301.06 A: and and that should have been taken care of years and years and years ago but 

300.42 301.92 B: oh i agree 

302.06 307.19 A: but you know as far as we changing our lives to 

307.24 310.50 A: you know because of nine eleven [mn] 

311.29 321.46 A: the only the only thing that i think that we have really done since nine eleven is to make sure that we have told people 

321.82 323.26 A: that we love 

323.41 331.04 A: and people that you know we're very concerned about as far as their life and the way that they're living 

331.48 334.01 A: we have told them you know 

334.01 346.81 A: more directly that yes we do love you we want you to be a better person you know these are things that we think might be able ah to benefit your life 

346.53 350.93 B: right make you a stronger person and a stronger family 

348.19 358.76 A: yes make you a stronger person and make sure that you know the people that we are involved with know that we are supporting them no matter what 

358.61 360.24 B: yes i agree 

360.41 368.42 A: and that you know i think that's the only thing that has really changed in our life since nine eleven is the fact that 

368.64 373.58 A: we've had to be we- we've been forcing ourself to be more verbal 

373.70 378.46 A: as far as our emotions and stuff like that 

377.94 381.31 B: and that's made the country stronger as a whole 

380.10 381.08 A: right 

381.51 382.92 B: you know i 

383.05 389.41 B: i mean i truly believe that too and i and i agree with you i think we've done the same thing within our family unit 

389.41 399.98 B: and with our friends and so forth um it's but i also like i say i have become more aware of my surroundings and things that might be happening 

400.23 404.16 B: um with crime and things like that 

403.78 404.80 A: yeah 

404.32 411.69 B: and not to avoid it but if i can put a stop to it i will [laughter] 

410.85 412.24 A: right 

411.81 416.85 B: and not turn the other cheek on that sense um 

416.45 417.18 A: (( [cough] )) 

417.11 426.22 B: but preparing for a disaster like i say we do have a lot of military here and with the n._o._r._a._d. facility that's a the prime target 

425.89 427.08 A: right 

427.65 435.55 B: but other than that we haven't really changed either um as far as things that we've done i mean i'm not afraid to get on an airplane 

436.01 440.00 B: um you know if it's gonna be it's gonna be [mn] 

439.52 443.96 A: that's right yeah it would of happened before or it could happen after 

443.50 450.31 B: exactly and and hopefully that won't happen anymore you know that um [noise] 

444.40 445.21 A: yeah 

451.02 460.41 B: hopefully things are changing in iraq and so forth and terrorists are realizing that um it's not gonna be put up with you know 

460.17 461.18 A: right 

461.03 463.15 B: and those that are harboring 

463.89 469.92 B: harboring the terrorists too you know i think things will be happening in syria 

466.11 467.03 A: right 

470.40 471.60 B: more so 

471.44 472.75 A: yeah 

473.04 475.22 B: if some of them did escape 

475.27 478.12 B: that's probably where they went so 

479.56 484.25 B: but september eleventh was a very sad situation i 

483.16 484.02 A: (( yeah )) 

484.28 487.86 B: witnessed it on t._v. the day it was happening [mn] 

487.70 488.57 A: (( yes )) 

488.26 491.03 B: like i just couldn't believe it it's like 

492.34 494.63 B: i i can't imagine 

496.46 497.31 B: what 

497.35 507.68 B: those people were feeling and thinking and um having to go through that and then the people that cleaned up the mess and so forth you know 

509.09 511.10 B: it's just a horrible thing 

510.89 512.07 A: yeah 

512.50 513.73 B: so 

514.29 515.38 B: um
