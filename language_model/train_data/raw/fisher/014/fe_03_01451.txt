2.84 4.44 B: good i'm jeanette 

4.03 5.44 A: (( i'm florence )) 

5.34 6.60 B: (( what was your name )) 

6.08 7.41 A: florence 

6.95 9.58 B: florence pleased to meet you 

7.70 8.53 A: yeah 

9.23 10.96 A: (( yeah same here jeanette mhm mhm )) 

9.75 14.75 B: know what the topic is today how have you changed your life after september eleventh 

15.03 16.59 B: what do you think what'd you do 

16.76 19.83 A: (( i didn't do anything differently )) 

19.94 21.85 B: differently [laughter] 

20.26 26.51 A: [laughter] i mean from whatever i've been used to i didn't make any major changes 

26.50 40.91 B: yeah i didn't either but i mean it kinda makes you aware you know that i mean since it was the first attack on you know american soil since pearl harbor like it kinda makes you think and especially since it was a terroristic act you know 

27.90 28.80 A: uh-huh 

30.47 31.63 A: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

40.63 41.72 A: yeah 

41.00 53.53 B: but it it just kinda brought to light the fact of um you know i mean 'cause yo- you always kinda know that america does things to people you know america kind of puts itself first you know and then um 

49.01 49.90 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

51.40 52.50 A: mhm 

54.01 66.94 B: you realize that when you know somebody attacks us and like as horrible as it is and how nobody should die like and i totally disagree with war or you know disagree with it the attacks uh on september eleventh you know 

63.36 64.33 A: mhm 

66.75 75.09 B: i still feel that maybe uh america should look at itself and uh try to be a little more fair you know [laughter] i i don't know 

73.09 82.98 A: mhm yeah i do kinda i kind of think that we should uh since like we meddle into other people's affairs a little bit too much 

80.97 81.93 B: mhm 

82.58 83.70 B: mhm 

83.00 86.88 A: and um most of the time when we meddle 

86.92 101.49 A: one can't but think that we're doing it for secondary being you know because okay look at what is going on now without that yeah i mean with saddam now you know even though we claim that we're trying to 

90.92 91.90 B: mhm 

97.28 98.43 B: exactly 

101.35 105.87 B: yeah i know you hear about operation you know for iraqi freedom 

101.73 102.96 A: (( you know co- )) 

103.20 104.20 A: (( yeah )) 

105.39 106.91 A: yeah yeah 

105.97 113.55 B: but you know i think it's more like operation get some republican you know companies in there you know basically 

112.08 115.80 A: exactly yeah exactly that's exactly what it is 

113.78 119.63 B: you know whoever gives the most to the republican party can go in there and rebuild iraq yeah that's ridiculous 

116.58 117.85 A: yeah 

118.99 128.99 A: uh-huh and then it seems that we're doing all that to the detriment of our own people look at how many people are dying the young ones out there they have families 

128.27 138.98 B: exactly exactly why spend what was the projected budget it was something like seventy no it was like what is it what was it like eighty billion dollars on war 

129.21 130.16 A: uh-huh 

136.05 140.28 A: oh some crazy million billion dollars right we could 

139.30 142.97 B: and then uh why don't they use that for education or something 

142.49 143.89 A: mhm 

143.25 145.10 B: you know that's ridiculous 

144.48 158.73 A: and then all that means that that leaves lot more open somehow somewhere along the line could be more targets because forget the fact that they say the iraqi people are happy and all that i don't think that's the true picture 

150.61 151.47 B: right 

151.95 152.90 B: mhm 

158.52 159.39 B: yeah 

158.74 164.30 A: i think we still leaving ourselves more open and so when something like 

164.36 178.66 A: unfortunate though september september eleven was when something like that happens one can't but think that you know if like we brought this upon ourselves because sometimes it seems like we should just mhm 

167.60 168.43 B: mhm 

174.46 175.42 B: right 

176.31 180.49 B: because i mean look at the things you know you could look at the things right now that are happening 

179.41 189.01 A: yeah yeah and it's not going to stop terrorist attacks look at how we getting prepared you know we don't even know as we speak now what will happen 

188.75 189.91 B: exactly 

189.24 195.33 A: and if one says to make life changes now what type of changes are we going to make 

195.02 196.32 B: yeah right 

195.55 197.70 A: you know what [laughter] you know 

196.77 207.38 B: and then look at like you just loo- i just hate the you know look at the racism now you know look against yo- you know all types of just you know not even people from iraq like you know 

200.63 201.63 A: uh-huh 

206.85 208.03 A: mhm 

207.29 218.93 B: people from india and just anybody you know that looks like they could be from that area you know and and i heard that like people are like actually like american citizens that are iraqi 

212.18 213.32 A: yeah 

218.48 219.45 A: mhm 

218.81 223.90 B: you know are being questioned now and things like that and that's ridiculous 

220.74 221.91 A: (( yes )) 

222.04 223.23 A: yeah 

223.25 229.51 A: it is exactly exactly and and so we you know one can't but say 

229.61 236.80 A: why we doing that why why we don't need to i understand yeah war peace all that but that's 

231.41 232.34 B: mhm 

237.58 252.24 B: yeah and it's such it's such an american way of looking at things you know let's rebuild iraq as america basically you know in a democracy when people who have been living there you know i mean it's totally different you can't understand what it's like to live in this in a culture 

237.78 238.48 A: (( just )) 

241.71 242.57 A: yeah 

243.37 246.22 A: yeah why why do we have to 

247.43 248.79 A: (( mhm )) 

251.87 253.05 A: right 

252.16 255.73 B: you know you can't just walk in and impose your culture on someone else's 

254.77 257.01 A: (( on somebody else exactly )) 

255.86 260.77 B: you know huh and think it's going to work because it's superior you know just ridiculous 

257.47 258.53 A: mhm 

258.71 268.72 A: (( yeah not just yeah i mean it it's just unfortunate because when it comes to you know the nitty gritty of it it is the poor ordinary people that will suffer )) 

268.47 269.63 B: mhm 

268.72 274.49 A: (( and go for the like september eleventh should happen go oh no you know )) 

272.31 286.02 B: exactly but it's because of the big guys the big guys up top that cause you know the innocent people you know i i don't care what they say about like the middle class and everything like that you know there's the workers and then there's the people in charge you know 

274.57 275.75 A: yeah 

275.99 277.01 A: yeah 

278.05 278.94 A: mhm 

280.68 282.53 A: (( i don't i don't see )) 

284.51 292.79 A: (( any right exactly and it's always the top you know sitting on the low and the ones below no matter whichever are the )) 

290.22 293.77 B: exactly and it's the little ones blindly working for them 

293.29 295.36 A: (( yes yes yeah yeah )) 

294.07 300.63 B: you know and and i don't know that i've actually changed anything but it's just brought more ideas to light 

297.79 298.62 A: (( no )) 

300.28 302.44 A: yeah yeah it 

300.85 306.67 B: you know things about you know what you can trust and you know freedoms and things like that 

306.14 312.78 A: yeah it did bring things to light and also it makes me think go for this something actual happen 

312.64 326.49 A: you know in the future wars it lets us see plainly how we leave ourselves open for targets how we you know meddle into people's businesses and for in retaliation we leave ourselves out you know 

318.51 319.67 B: exactly 

326.32 327.73 B: yep that's right 

327.13 328.54 A: yeah yeah 

328.34 343.07 B: it's just crazy and you know and i hate these the especially especially you know and i don't know if it's the media or if it's just people believe just what they hear and things without doing research but like i i heard something like eighty per cent of the people thought saddam hussein like 

343.20 346.72 B: was behind the september eleventh att- att- you know attacks 

346.27 347.87 A: (( it mhm well )) 

347.27 354.20 B: and i saw i heard people people who are going to war saying i'm doing this because of september eleventh and it really had nothing to do with each other 

352.01 352.86 A: (( and so )) 

353.42 355.86 A: it doesn't exactly 

354.72 360.89 B: they just think oh middle east oh it's somewhere that's not in the u._s. they must be ganged up with each other 

358.40 359.70 A: (( [laughter] )) 

361.09 363.41 A: (( also how about all all )) 

365.07 369.84 A: he didn't do it you know i mean that's just it's just 

366.43 367.48 B: mhm 

370.17 379.60 A: it's just a mental thing psychology thing to get the poor military people to be sent off to be out there and unfortunately 

373.16 373.85 B: yeah 

378.04 387.31 B: yeah exactly thinking they're killing for a good reason when they're killing for oil you know they're killing so we can fuel our s._u._v.s for twenty cents less a gallon 

380.54 383.92 A: yeah yeah exactly 

386.77 401.26 A: yeah exactly exactly they're not killing for no no no just cause we don't know what is happening but you know they could be sent off somewhere that they believe it you know that they doing it for just cause god bless them but 

387.54 388.45 B: you know 

398.08 399.05 B: mhm 

401.49 405.56 A: i i don't i don't i don't approve of it at all i really don't 

404.01 405.98 B: no me neither 

405.74 407.13 A: mhm well 

406.35 411.11 B: and and it seems like like people do and i wonder why you know 

410.81 411.96 A: yeah 

411.34 418.62 B: but i guess everyone has their their right to their own their own opinion but i just wish people's opinions were a little more educated 

418.12 421.80 A: (( right [laughter] yes exactly uh-huh uh-huh )) 

419.24 420.47 B: you know [laughter] 

420.95 425.41 B: you know people just say things 'cause they hear it hear somebody else say it you know [laughter] 

423.31 424.58 A: they hear that 

424.98 429.48 A: yeah but then you know that's the that's what they want too to 

429.44 440.24 A: to make us so much like we believe it i don't even want to look at the news i don't follow the war and you know i once in a while i want to listen 

435.60 437.56 B: oh i know oh i know 

440.29 443.80 A: just to have a vague idea but i'm not seriously into it 

442.32 456.11 B: yeah but it's but it's corporate owned media you know the corporations own it and they'll show you you know as much as they say it's free media like you can tell that that the news is pro war especially fox fox is bad 

444.54 446.37 A: yes yes 

447.44 448.79 A: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

449.53 450.25 A: (( oh )) 

450.68 452.37 A: (( of course )) 

453.11 454.02 A: right 

455.39 456.04 A: (( mm )) 

456.21 456.92 A: i 

457.35 462.74 A: don't in my own eyes they are all the same they are working for the one and the same person 

462.45 463.62 B: that's right 

463.13 469.00 A: you know so we don't even have our mind to make our own opinions they no more you know 

467.79 479.38 B: right exactly and that's bad like what can you trust what do you know you know when you find out that you've been lied to like you know then who do you believe you know what what is real any more you know 

469.88 471.25 A: it is 

474.20 475.85 A: mhm yeah 

476.68 477.84 A: i know we can 

478.97 482.63 A: (( yes i know we can only trust god that's all )) 

481.90 483.22 B: (( yeah right )) 

482.78 484.48 A: really really 

484.93 486.53 A: well gosh

488.15 491.23 A: [laughter] yeah exactly what else 

490.64 493.54 B: yeah i think we've covered all those bases 

492.87 494.56 A: uh-huh so 

494.80 496.63 A: i do know that 

497.15 502.58 A: (( september eleven i wasn't you know personally um )) 

502.60 510.60 A: affected but i know as a nation we all were affected but once in a while i just think about those families you know 

506.45 507.76 B: yeah mhm 

510.85 514.91 A: those people that were you know maybe they have family there they 

514.46 519.80 B: oh that's horrible it's horrible when anyone dies in murders and car accidents anything 

515.74 517.83 A: it is it is 

518.74 520.46 A: uh-huh uh-huh 

520.16 522.22 B: you know it's not a good thing you 

521.25 523.34 A: it's not at all at all 

522.51 530.26 B: know and i didn't know anyone either i think the closest person was like my mom's brother had worked with a guy or something 

524.21 525.18 A: mhm 

529.72 530.80 A: yeah 

530.38 532.80 B: you know but but you know

535.07 536.79 B: oh yeah absolutely 

536.30 547.93 A: many times i let it go over in my mind i mean those people thinking okay they getting all that money to go to work they'll be back soon you know little little sad pictures like that 

544.79 545.74 B: mhm 

547.57 553.00 B: and that's the thing like you and i we talk about how we weren't really affected but it's been how long now 

551.37 553.66 A: mhm yeah 

552.88 565.87 B: like right after i'm sure you know i don't know about you but i was i was a little paranoid and i thought about things a little more and appreciated things a little more but just like everything else that just fades over time and you just go back into your old routine you know 

554.21 555.25 A: mhm 

557.79 558.54 A: mhm 

560.63 561.57 A: yeah 

563.08 564.18 A: it does 

565.16 572.56 A: yeah it does and that's why sometimes i'm like okay that's being and it's gone who knows what else 

572.03 573.77 B: yeah exactly 

572.57 580.48 A: you know who knows what else well we just pray nothing else happens you know but we got to 

577.80 578.78 B: yeah 

579.49 586.32 B: so but you know what are they going to do like take away our freedom you know and our you know just for security like that's not fair either 

582.64 583.78 A: mhm 

585.82 587.43 A: (( it's not it's not )) 

586.54 591.57 B: you know so like like you said we just have to look at how we're meddling with people's stuff 

590.97 593.59 A: yes exactly i'm 

592.33 599.08 B: you know but but who are we you know who are we to [laughter] if only people like you and me were running the show [laughter] 

597.94 599.90 A: (( i tell you that's right ))
