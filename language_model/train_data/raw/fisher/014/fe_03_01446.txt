105.04 105.65 A: (( well the )) 

105.48 116.97 A: biggest change i've i have noticed in my life has been that the freedoms that have been taken the legislations that have passed after september eleventh i know some of them are for good 

116.82 124.09 A: purposes but it seems like there's all our freedom that we did have even though they say it's protectionist really is 

117.75 119.21 B: oh my god 

124.33 126.18 A: taking it all away from us 

125.48 127.03 B: it's a nightmare 

126.72 127.83 A: it is 

127.20 134.03 B: i mean it's i mean it the act it's i mean it's i mean it's given the government so much license 

130.27 131.36 A: yes 

133.68 139.80 A: right they can do anything they want if they just if they don't like you they can find some reason to convict you for something 

139.38 143.09 B: yeah well you know they can hold you for questioning indefinitely now 

140.39 141.15 A: [laughter] 

142.96 147.31 A: right and they don't have to tell anybody where you're at or what you're doing or anything 

146.26 150.14 B: if they find you suspicious yeah it's it's 

148.54 149.54 A: right 

149.80 155.89 A: th- that that kind of scares me and it also scares me you know for the future for like the children in the future too i mean 

156.24 161.61 A: they're not going to know what it was like to be really in a free free country i mean it's 

161.63 163.19 A: it's changed so much 

161.91 162.95 B: yeah 

163.30 165.50 B: yeah it's really terrifying 

165.60 166.55 B: um 

166.76 176.05 B: god you know collecting like what used to be collected as aggregate data is like now available to the govern- like your shopping list like if you have like a safeway club card 

174.05 175.07 A: right 

175.97 176.90 A: right 

176.27 179.63 B: or i mean i don't know where you're from i don't know if they have safeway where you're at but 

178.99 182.40 A: ri [laughter] yeah no i don't but they do have the 

180.84 181.59 B: [laughter] 

182.50 185.69 A: they have like bi-lo and ingles and stuff like that 

184.91 186.61 B: (( yeah wh- where are you at )) 

186.35 188.31 A: i'm in south carolina where are you 

188.20 189.78 B: i'm in i'm in seattle 

189.62 191.69 A: seattle oh wow um 

193.28 195.42 A: i have um some friends in seattle 

196.56 197.58 B: um 

197.84 203.99 B: but yeah i mean i yeah i just found it really really appalling but i've also found 

204.03 206.65 B: legislation that bush has passed 

208.07 208.90 A: right 

208.76 214.50 B: you know this has been an act but especially from september eleven he's just used it as this like license to just 

211.68 212.50 A: right 

214.56 228.52 A: right to do whatever he wants well an- an- and it's always the case if if the present president party is the majority in congress too they're going to get a lot more passed than if there was like a democrat and a republican you know 

215.88 217.11 B: yeah it's 

227.60 234.18 B: yeah yeah i mean i ca- i can just you know hope that in the next presidential term like it a lot of it will be overturned 

228.68 229.39 A: (( or )) 

234.21 235.73 A: right 

234.24 238.25 B: otherwise we're totally screwed [laughter] yeah yeah you 

236.11 239.28 A: right [laughter] pretty much pretty much 

238.27 243.43 B: know on the airport going to the airport now and seeing it like people with guns 

243.45 244.70 A: (( that's much )) 

243.55 244.94 B: at your airport 

244.86 245.65 A: (( yeah )) 

244.96 248.55 B: but i remember the first time i flew after september eleventh and saw that it was just 

248.69 250.26 B: totally unreal 

249.91 255.92 A: yeah we had to fly out that weekend after it happened because my um brother's wedding was that weekend 

255.67 256.97 B: (( oh man )) 

256.16 264.14 A: so it was pretty nazi that's one thing that has changed in my life is you go to the airport earlier than what you used to [laughter] 

264.16 266.46 B: yeah yeah 

265.10 268.12 A: because half the time you don't make it if you don't 

268.21 277.33 B: and for some reason i i i don't know if i look deceptively innocent or what but like i'm always the person who is singled out to like have the extra baggage check 

277.39 278.91 A: are you serious 

278.16 280.70 B: (( yes [laughter] i don't know )) 

279.34 280.20 A: you know wh- 

280.67 285.45 A: you know what someone told me is the maj- the majority of people that have their um 

285.49 295.33 A: their luggage checked um at airports now are the people between the ages of twenty five and like thirty five single white females or females white females 

294.75 297.73 B: really where did you where did you hear that statistic 

297.35 301.13 A: [mn] um where did we hear that did we read it jake or what [noise] 

302.54 304.10 A: it's just been reported 

304.33 312.49 A: lou rockwell um different people have reported that um saying that that's that's the single most person 

307.88 308.81 B: okay 

310.71 314.92 B: well that's that's me i'm not demographic [laughter] 

312.62 313.55 A: (( have you )) 

313.57 316.56 A: [laughter] so if you fit in that category and jake 

316.37 328.89 A: his sister was flying out of the country and he said beware you are going to be checked i just know it because you're flying out the country you know because she's a missionary and you're going to be checked you're female you're thirty 

328.67 334.32 A: about thirty years old you're going to be checked don't worry about it and she's like no i've never been checked there's no big deal and she did 

334.28 335.23 B: yeah 

334.60 337.18 A: she was they let through all first class 

336.85 346.71 B: yeah i um i went to canada um you know because it's right here um right after sept- like on september twenty second and um it's usually 

344.60 345.68 A: mhm 

347.27 349.42 B: relatively easy but it was 

350.23 352.36 B: kind of okay going in 

352.46 356.01 B: but coming back it took six hours to cross the border coming back 

355.92 357.85 A: it's back into the united states oh 

357.20 371.53 B: and they interrogated me and they i mean they check not only do they like open your trunk and look in it like they look in all your bags which was totally appropriate right but it was also totally different from you know the time previous that i'd gone to canada 

370.07 378.41 A: goodness right right and the thing is if there happens to be more than once it makes you suspicious so i'm like you know hey wh- what's why are you picking on me 

377.64 388.82 B: [laughter] sort of thing the same thing at the airport like it's a i fly southwest i don't if they had i don't think they have that where you're at either but it's um one of the budget airlines where it's open boarding 

378.91 379.79 A: [laughter] 

384.21 385.01 A: uh-huh 

388.77 389.86 A: (( oh ho )) 

389.18 400.89 B: so it's by like uh like you you know you just you get a number and you you go on and so [laughter] i get kept on being singled out i had my luggage luggage checked and it totally meant that i got a terrible seat it was so lame 

399.85 405.08 A: oh 'cause you were the last person on oh my it's because you had to wait to get it right yeah 

401.95 402.88 B: (( right )) 

404.45 406.43 B: right totally 

405.61 420.07 A: oh that the the airports definitely have changes it's not not i'm sure that it has some benefits but it almost to me sometimes it feels like it's a facade like it makes you feel more secure not that it really is that much more secure 

419.86 420.91 B: yeah 

420.16 426.50 A: because i mean if you real- if someone really wanted to get through they went through as employees not as passengers 

426.44 427.45 B: yeah 

426.81 428.82 A: you know the people that did go on 

428.94 430.37 A: (( so you know )) 

429.24 430.20 B: yeah 

430.70 433.02 A: i don't know it it's a 

430.81 431.79 B: yeah 

433.19 435.31 A: win win thing i guess [laughter] 

435.03 435.81 B: [laughter] 

435.53 439.28 A: you ge- you give up some and you win some yeah so 

438.77 440.73 B: yeah i mean i don't 

441.09 444.53 B: [sigh] i don't mind being inconvenienced when i travel 

443.50 444.33 A: (( mhm )) 

444.60 450.05 B: i just you know i mind having less freedom of speech and less right to assemble [laughter] 

448.53 449.43 A: right 

449.76 450.89 A: right 

450.26 455.42 B: you know [laughter] because i'm there's basically a patriot act two on the table in 

451.27 452.34 A: right and the 

455.20 456.10 A: mhm 

455.52 457.49 B: legislature and um 

458.84 459.80 B: they're act- 

459.88 466.03 B: they're they're some i wish i could remember like the exact verbiage of it but there's legislation that says something like 

466.23 467.21 B: um 

467.90 480.95 B: any group like that you don't have the right to assemble it's like your behavior can be perceived as terrorist and it's got this really really vaguely defined definition of terrorism it means that we like any anything anti institutional is is terrorist 

475.47 476.55 A: right 

477.06 478.49 A: right yeah 

480.33 483.63 A: or you own a gun you know or something like that 

483.51 498.01 B: it yeah it it you can't i mean like totally totally infringing on like especially the right to assemble which you know is really really messed up considering you know that there's a war on and people want to protest the war 

488.47 489.43 A: mhm 

490.75 491.63 A: right 

497.92 498.78 A: right 

498.55 511.34 B: you know like like the definition of the law you know maybe it was local legislation maybe it wasn't uh federal but there's this definition that basically mean it's terrorist behavior to like attend an anti war protest 

504.09 505.54 A: right 

512.17 512.86 B: but 

512.37 513.59 A: (( oh it's nuts )) 

513.66 521.37 A: tha- that is that and i agree with that too in the they're saying you know certain acts are saying that if a child 

521.37 535.58 A: you know talks about different things then they get classified in a certain category and anytime anything happens they're the ones checked and you know when they become adults yeah i mean they're they're talking about all types of stuff where you know if 

530.38 531.86 B: are you serious 

536.25 537.54 A: your child 

538.05 543.03 A: goes hunting with you or something you're a hunter um if you have a gun and you go hunting you know there 

546.71 548.10 A: right and um 

548.23 560.11 A: my husband just said both and colorado are two of the states that have databases of potential criminals that are children right now that could grow up to pot- potentially be a criminal because they 

558.94 560.60 B: oh my god 

559.88 563.40 A: enjoy hunting they enjoy being outside an- and they enjoy 

563.41 566.40 A: you know stuff like that and it's not a crime 

565.06 572.11 B: that sort of profiling is just so terrifying i mean the fact that like police are able to do racial profiling again 

567.94 568.95 A: i know 

571.85 572.75 A: right 

572.47 575.44 B: uh uh i mean i find it totally appalling i had um 

575.47 578.46 B: an iraqi cab driver a couple of weeks ago 

578.19 579.24 A: mhm 

578.62 584.45 B: and who you know is a physicist but can only get a job driving a cab here 

583.89 585.11 A: that's sad 

585.10 592.71 B: yeah and um you know i ju- i had a really um interesting conversation with him about how he's treated 

592.66 593.75 A: mhm 

593.04 596.09 B: just post september eleventh uh 

595.23 599.95 A: oh i'm sure i'm sure there's a lot of that and it and that that 

596.29 597.26 B: you know 

598.38 599.34 B: yeah
