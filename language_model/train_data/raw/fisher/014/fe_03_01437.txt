60.18 61.22 A: yeah 

65.20 66.21 A: mhm 

65.58 70.60 B: you hear a plane and you like look out to make sure that it's not going to crash 'cause i'm real close to new orleans 

70.22 71.19 A: mhm 

70.96 75.13 B: and i know right after september eleventh i was really scared i thought that 

75.29 77.62 B: you know something was going to happen here 

77.35 78.26 A: mhm 

77.80 86.95 B: and i didn't want you know with cars that you know you go to the store you know and you you see somebody that looks different from you and you're like you know is that somebody who you know do they have a bomb on them [laughter] you know it 

86.03 87.80 A: [laughter] yeah 

87.14 90.76 B: because i have a small child too so it also 

90.65 91.51 A: (( yeah of )) 

90.84 96.07 B: you know affects the way i look with her because i don't want i i don't want anything to happen to her 

95.91 96.93 A: course 

97.35 103.37 B: so i mean it ha- it hasn't drastically changed my life but i think it makes my eyes a a little bit more open 

97.43 98.36 A: yeah 

103.28 104.23 A: yeah 

103.60 104.67 B: (( so um )) 

104.77 108.43 B: what's going on in the world makes me watch the news a little bit more and 

107.79 108.73 A: yeah 

108.64 109.79 B: you know i 

110.65 112.15 B: i don't know i just 

112.32 113.84 B: (( [noise] )) 

113.01 114.88 A: to me it just kinda like i mean 

114.84 119.99 A: i i knew that eventually something like this was going to happen anyway there's going to be many more things that happen 

119.86 120.70 B: right 

119.94 133.16 A: because i mean just basically it's it's coming now to it's about really about to be the end of the world you know what i'm saying whether people want to think think about it or you know just try to push it to the side it is going to happen and these are basically 

126.95 127.69 B: right 

132.96 141.67 A: i don't know what religion you are this is not even any religion this is just if you read the bible these are just the signs of the times different things just happen you know and 

139.37 140.26 B: (( exactly )) 

141.67 153.79 A: this whole thing going on now a war nation versus nation and just all this other crazy stuff i mean this is going to get gradually get worse and the worser it gets it's just know that th- the coming is soon but i mean 

154.09 165.63 A: like you said i i do try to keep both eyes open i'm a little more cautious of course with the little war going on now everyone's watching the news a little bit more even though it's like trying to settle down or die down now but 

164.28 168.61 B: right yeah there was just a shooting in new orleans also in a school 

168.90 170.08 A: really 

168.92 177.48 B: and that that shocked me because that's close to home you know you think you know how is your kids even safe at home you know you're not even safe you know going to work 

171.86 172.83 A: mhm 

177.14 178.20 A: yeah 

177.58 184.86 B: you know there's people just go and sh- on planes and yo- you're just you're not safe anywheres just the whole thing 

184.47 185.38 A: yeah 

185.32 197.45 B: i guess it's changed my lie 'cause i'm twenty five you know um i'm fairly young and you know i have one child and it having a child makes you also open your eyes to what's going on because i think if i was younger and it wouldn't even 

197.58 199.09 B: it wouldn't bother me 

198.80 199.80 A: yeah 

199.10 201.93 B: you know 'cause she doesn't know what's going on i'm not going to tell her 

201.91 202.81 A: yeah 

202.05 204.22 B: you know at this age but 

203.59 204.33 A: (( yeah )) 

204.57 206.45 A: 'cause she wouldn't understand anyway so 

205.78 210.66 B: yeah she wouldn't understand my friend has a seven year old and he doesn't even know what's going on 

210.57 214.52 A: my brother i don't think really understands he's thirteen so yeah 

213.69 222.04 B: yeah my mom's a school teacher and they're not even allowed to talk about it in the schools so which is good because they don't need to be around it 

221.93 223.16 A: yeah 

222.55 229.92 B: in the schools either so i mean it's bad enough that their parents are probably watching it twenty four seven and they have to go to school and see it so 

230.91 231.81 B: so 

232.01 241.87 B: i don't know i think every it's just the world everybody is just full of hatred no matter where you are you know you're judged wherever you go and no matter what 

241.85 248.56 B: what race or you know what kind of ethnicity you know you are people are going to look at you different and somebody doesn't like you 

248.93 250.95 B: you never know what's going to happen 

250.43 251.51 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

251.33 253.11 B: see i don't go into the city 

253.32 254.48 A: (( yeah yeah really [laughter] )) 

253.88 258.18 B: yeah i don't like new orleans i try to stay out of the city period 

258.75 260.55 B: i don't want tobe a part of it 

261.39 263.13 A: it kind of violent to you 

261.39 262.41 B: (( see it )) 

262.76 271.40 B: yeah you never know what's going to happen they don't know how to drive um that's where a lot of crime go you know you can go and saw dixie and he might go shoot you 

264.68 265.53 A: true 

271.61 273.04 A: (( oh lord mm )) 

272.36 277.03 B: i mean you never know what's going to ha- it's just new orleans it's just not a it's not a good city and 

277.18 281.65 B: people go out there to the french quarter for mardi gras and you know you you might end up getting shot 

281.61 282.90 A: yeah 

282.92 293.51 A: i don't even know it was really that even dangerous like that i've never been but my sister of course they've been down there a couple of times for mardi gras and go to bourbon street or whatever but mm 

292.61 296.95 B: yeah if you go if you go there late enough or if you go there during certain times 

297.43 299.05 B: then it's not safe 

299.31 300.51 A: mm 

299.47 302.74 B: you know you go in groups you don't go over there by yourself because 

302.13 303.15 A: (( mm okay mm )) 

302.79 313.05 B: people like steal you wallet you know there's always those people that ruin it mardi gras they rui- you know they always have to ruin it i know september eleventh really affected mardi gras 

313.40 317.38 B: and all the different things that we've had down here i think super bowl was here 

317.19 318.22 A: mhm 

317.42 326.94 B: or something else there's something else here that they had a you know top security you know you feel safe but you never know i think i went to a football game right after september eleventh 

327.43 328.26 A: yeah 

327.45 338.81 B: and i was nervous being up in the superdome with all those people and saying you know what this is a good place to bomb because there's so many people i mean it was packed and i was i was literally nervous 

335.40 336.42 A: yeah 

338.88 340.03 A: [laughter] 

339.38 347.54 B: [laughter] 'cause you never know 'cause i'm thinking you know these people they're not you know they're not going to do another plane i wasn't scared to ride a plane they're not going to pull that again they're going to do something different 

343.57 344.94 A: yeah 

347.08 350.16 A: yeah and you never know what it what it is but i guess 

349.96 364.51 A: the only thing that kinda saves me from even being frightened or even worried about anything like that that's just life period and that's just i guess how if god created it things are going to happen and if they're meant to happen they're supposed to happen they're going to happen anyway that's to you that's to me 

355.92 357.10 B: right 

363.00 363.97 B: right 

364.32 371.27 A: that's to anybody so you can't really sit around and actually worry or be thinking about well i hope this doesn't happen you just have to try to 

368.03 369.08 B: (( right )) 

371.04 379.57 A: pray and keep a a pretty close relationship with god and just ask whatever does happen let me able to handle it let me able to deal with it 'cause if it's meant to happen to you it going to happen anyway 

379.31 380.21 B: right 

379.37 388.31 A: like me i was really about to go into the reserves for a minute even while like the war was going on people were like are you crazy the war's going on and they're even sending reserves to the war 

388.15 398.98 A: if it's if it's meant for me to go to kuwait or whatever even though by the time i got in there it wouldn't even probably be a war anyway but of course there's going to be more things further on in life you know i could end up in 

394.72 395.52 B: right 

398.77 407.92 A: but when it's time for you to go it's your time to go you can't sit and worry about that you know that you have to live your life you have to go out there and do the same thing 'cause it's going to get worse it there's going to be more things you know so 

406.32 407.31 B: right 

408.09 410.15 A: i guess i kinda look at it like that 

408.15 412.68 B: yeah and all the people opposing it which is so makes me 

412.89 417.19 B: feel like they're not supporting the troops who are out there risking their lives for us 

417.23 427.84 A: yeah it doesn't matter what kind of feelings you have or what george bush the decision he made you still have to give them you know support them for being out there protecting us 'cause we're not out there so i mean somebody has to do it yeah 

425.63 426.97 B: 'cause they want to be 

427.21 428.27 B: they want to be 

428.16 429.38 A: yeah 

428.26 437.85 B: and those people i mean i'm in i'm in law studies and i was learning that the people on september eleventh the people that weren't in the building that were um 

437.78 447.12 B: out having coffee before they went to work they were claiming insurance on their families like pretending like they were dead in order to get insurance money and that right there was really wrong 

439.54 440.61 A: mhm 

445.13 446.48 A: (( mm mm )) 

447.07 456.65 B: because all these par- these people suffer with families and that they're just trying to get a free ride out of it which is sad 'cause all the families that really did lose 

453.21 455.06 A: mhm mm 

456.68 457.84 A: yeah 

457.42 465.06 B: you know they probably didn't get what they needed and then they have these other little jerks out there that are just trying to make a couple dollars 

461.69 462.85 A: yeah 

463.10 464.19 A: yeah 

465.44 471.05 A: i wonder how they could even try to do something like that 'cause they'll eventually know that you're still living 

469.35 472.35 B: yeah they event- they found a bunch of them yeah they found them 

472.02 477.66 A: that that's so dumb i mean 'cause they're still living what they going to do go under like another code or something another name 

476.32 480.04 B: you can go under somebody else's name it's real easy to do it 

479.96 483.34 A: and just act like you're another totally different person for the rest of your life 

482.33 491.96 B: you just go yeah you can just go look and pull up a deceased person's name and just go up and say my name is this person and i don't have my social security number i lost it in a fire and you get a new social and a new name 

492.05 495.09 A: (( mm oh okay i get it you know that's yeah you can )) 

493.51 494.84 B: so that's what they do 

495.31 498.05 A: yeah well you do bad like that it's going to come back 

496.81 510.71 B: right i mean there's ways you know i mean i learned about you know he's not teaching us how to do it but he was just telling us you know what these people are doing you know trying to get some money for their families illegally which leaves probably less money for the people that are really 

510.79 512.47 B: that really did suffer 

511.92 513.00 A: yeah 

512.72 526.98 B: 'cause i mean that right there was so sad i thought that was new orleans because my mother in law told me it's on on the t._v. and i just see this building burning and i was like what is this she's crying you know i thought it was new orleans and i mean that was a real shock [laughter] you know it was sort of like 

523.10 524.14 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

524.40 525.14 A: [laughter] 

527.10 534.48 B: what i got it re- it didn't hit me i didn't know what was going on i was like what's so bad okay well a plane hit i didn't realize the effects of it 

534.76 536.14 A: yeah exactly 

535.78 540.85 B: and then my dad flies a lot and it makes me nervous because i mean i really don't think they're going to do it on a plane again 

540.49 541.73 A: yeah 

541.10 546.22 B: i but i was so scared that the plane like maybe that day because they had some other flights but 

545.95 547.05 A: yeah 

546.40 549.89 B: and then your emails you know they get bombarded with 

549.93 558.58 B: this is the end of the world friday the thirteenth the end of the world because this is what's happening and then you start freaking out oh my god like it's the end of the world because nostradamus predicted this you know 

555.81 556.71 A: [laughter] 

558.08 559.33 A: yeah 

558.60 565.02 B: all these crazy emails and i'm just glad that i you know i wasn't in that city 'cause i don't know what i would of done 

565.25 566.20 A: yeah 

565.30 566.27 B: (( you know )) 

566.69 567.66 A: yep 

567.74 568.98 B: but um 

569.01 569.85 A: oh 

569.65 571.93 B: as far as like effect you know 

572.39 582.66 B: i do my normal day thing like i was scared to leave i had to return a movie a blockbuster september eleventh and i was scared to leave my house [laughter] i didn't want to go you know leave and return i didn't know what was going on 

572.53 573.44 A: yeah 

579.57 580.43 A: [laughter] 

582.50 586.47 A: actually it was kinda crazy because um earlier that day 

586.80 593.09 A: i was at home and i was watching t._v. and i and i saw what it's like later on that day i end up going 

593.69 599.89 A: over to my friend's house it's way over there maybe like thirty minutes away and like every and we were i think we went to the mall or
