188.48 190.17 A: and um it 

190.50 193.82 A: was actually a customer that alerted us to 

193.89 198.30 A: what was going on that morning and um 

199.13 202.48 A: uh i just really made the decision that day it was like 

202.52 206.02 A: what am i doing here my family is 

203.64 204.78 B: (( mhm )) 

206.31 208.64 A: you know six hours away from me 

208.29 209.72 B: yeah 

209.13 214.61 A: and um it was a great job i had great benefits the pay was excellent 

215.19 218.12 A: but um none of that 

217.67 219.84 B: [laughter] it's not everything right 

218.20 220.19 A: matters you know 

220.63 225.80 A: um i wasn't where i wanted to be and i wasn't doing what i wanted to do 

220.85 222.24 B: yeah 

226.04 230.94 A: and like you said it was a wake up call it's like life's too short you know 

230.34 233.29 B: yeah i think everybody is really 

233.41 236.33 B: you know we think we get caught up in everyday 

236.73 247.08 B: you know boredom and you know routines and and i think that's changed a lot of people's outlook on life that you only have one and let's do it right the first time 

237.80 238.87 A: yeah 

243.18 244.37 A: i do too 

245.00 245.95 A: right 

247.40 249.90 A: and i think it also um 

250.09 255.31 A: for me personally it gave me some perspective on the things that i complained about all the time 

254.20 256.72 B: mhm [laughter] oh yeah 

256.30 260.12 A: um i think one of the most impactful things about that event 

261.40 264.66 A: [sigh] was the number of children 

264.26 265.14 B: oh 

265.13 269.66 A: who now were left with one parent where there had been two 

266.71 267.77 B: (( mhm )) 

269.73 271.02 A: you know that 

270.22 272.07 B: oh yeah 

271.50 273.27 A: was heart wrenching um 

272.70 274.94 B: [noise] what sorry about my daughter 

274.18 276.18 A: oh no problem 

275.67 282.72 B: what bothered me was [noise] i mean that was you know [noise] one big thing but you know of course the show's afterwards you got to hear all the [noise] 

283.07 296.56 B: and you know it's hard to listen to it but it was part of it and i think the country gave we should've gave 'em that right to hear like the phone calls you know that were made and and it was just so heart wrenching to hear 

292.90 294.07 A: right 

296.64 298.82 B: the panic in those people's voices 

298.10 299.09 A: oh 

299.02 304.85 B: and to hear [noise] to be the other person on the other line what [noise] you know [noise] what did they [noise] feel 

302.82 304.49 A: i can't imagine 

304.79 306.83 A: i can't imagine [noise] 

305.77 307.85 B: [noise] shh [noise]

333.90 334.92 A: uh 

335.41 341.96 A: [mn] i think for their entire lives they're just forever changed well i think the whole world is but

436.85 440.30 A: this plan and and i was um 

441.68 444.41 A: actually this moved it up about three years 

442.01 442.58 B: [noise] 

444.26 447.51 B: [noise] oh [noise] now do you have children or 

445.64 446.56 A: so there were

471.73 473.23 B: (( [noise] but )) 

473.76 480.75 B: right so would you suggest people follow their hearts or their minds

498.05 500.83 B: hey girl [laughter] [noise] 

498.68 508.01 A: definitely definitely and uh i think you know we go through processes in our life and and events like that 

504.90 506.98 B: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

509.17 511.69 A: well you just reevaluate everything 

509.28 510.05 B: (( [noise] uh )) 

511.33 513.38 B: (( right [noise] )) 

512.78 516.70 A: i know of something else that that um i think had an impact 

517.20 520.24 A: on me personally about that day 

520.34 528.06 A: was i found myself thinking about my parents a lot because my parents had lived through pearl harbor 

523.20 525.00 B: mhm 

525.47 526.70 B: [noise] 

528.42 530.92 A: had lost friends at pearl harbor 

531.54 536.81 A: and i mean that was very different it wasn't on on american soil 

536.38 537.65 B: right 

536.98 541.65 A: but it was still an event in their lives that i don't think i ever understood 

541.38 543.85 B: [noise] right 

542.29 544.86 A: until september eleventh happened 

543.89 548.96 B: [noise] right and and especially you know when you said i was the younger generation which i am 

549.00 557.04 B: [noise] this generation's never experienced anything that bad [noise] you know and i think not trying to be rude to my 

551.99 552.86 A: no 

554.21 555.11 A: (( [cough] )) 

557.03 564.89 B: age group [laughter] but i think we have been spoiled you know and i think we haven't seen the heartbreak [noise] and 

565.52 567.34 B: (( [cough] excuse me )) 

567.45 573.05 B: and you know things like vietnam that my father went through we've we haven't experienced that 

570.86 572.05 A: right 

573.39 575.66 B: and [noise] i think this really 

575.79 578.22 B: i think it woke my generation up big time 

577.73 579.38 A: [noise] i think it did too 

578.64 581.08 B: you know because [noise] life isn't fun 

581.22 589.29 B: and it's [noise] i mean it should be fun but it's not all games [noise] and they're i think a lot of kids my my kids i'm not a kid anymore but 

584.15 585.50 A: that's right 

588.49 590.77 A: well i understand what you're saying though 

590.36 591.88 B: but [noise] i think 

591.95 594.72 B: my generation didn't look at [noise] things the way 

594.89 596.95 B: the other generation did 

596.23 597.80 A: probably not 

597.30 598.64 B: and i think that's 

599.43 599.89 A: (( oh i ))
