0.75 2.01 B: hello 

2.33 4.34 A: hi this is jamie 

4.05 5.48 B: this is amber 

5.16 6.29 A: hi 

5.82 6.94 B: hi 

6.99 12.11 B: and my response to that is gonna be real short i've made [laughter] no changes 

11.18 17.50 A: yeah i was gonna say [laughter] pretty much the same thing i'm i'm i'm a big fan of travel and the 

17.37 31.01 A: the biggest thing to me is that i would like to go to the middle east and don't feel comfortable doing that any more and i'm a little more cautious about traveling in general but it certainly hasn't freaked me out to the point of you know not traveling or 

30.89 33.55 A: restricting myself altogether but 

32.91 35.88 B: yeah how where are you located 

35.27 37.82 A: uh in pennsylvania near philadelphia 

37.48 51.87 B: oh okay so you were actually w- i'm am in connecticut um we're kind north east of hartford so we're both of us i mean not real close to new york city but close enough i mean it's not like we're out in you know kansas [laughter] or something 

42.78 44.20 A: oh okay 

46.93 48.07 A: right 

50.63 59.67 A: well the weird thing is i was actually in ireland at the time and i i watched the whole thing i watched it from the very beginning when they were sort of like 

59.52 69.27 A: had no idea what was going on a plane was buzzing around there and then i saw the whole thing on t._v. and it was just like some weird movie some weird action movie or something it was really bizarre 

67.54 68.69 B: right 

69.60 71.01 A: and i i was 

71.21 82.94 A: really shocked i guess but then i just sort of felt like oh my god we've had this coming and not that we deserved it in any way but that this was definitely a result of the way we've been acting in the world and 

82.91 84.16 B: mhm 

82.99 88.52 A: um i i think i think the people that perpetrated it were i mean 

89.03 99.65 A: were fanatics and and it wasn't a rational thing but i i do think that we in some ways brought it on ourselves and certainly those people shouldn't have suffered for that but 

90.69 91.65 B: right 

96.29 97.31 B: yeah 

99.40 100.26 B: right 

100.99 105.10 B: um y- well you said you were in ireland so do you travel a lot 

104.83 116.59 A: um that was my first time really out of the country besides like visiting friends in canada but yeah i was actually originally i was teaching english in the czech republic for a couple of months and then 

107.58 108.90 B: oh okay 

116.59 120.64 A: um i stopped in ireland on my way back over here um the friend 

119.47 121.18 B: (( so you were on your way home )) 

120.71 122.89 A: yeah yeah we 

121.94 123.86 B: and couldn't get back home [laughter] 

123.20 126.26 A: no we got delayed [laughter] for a little while yeah 

125.66 131.63 B: now would you go back to czech republic and would you go back through ireland now 

130.47 133.24 A: oh sure oh yeah definitely 

132.57 135.86 B: so this wouldn't have affected your travel 

136.10 141.48 A: not not there i just i don't know i just i think it's sad that 

141.59 152.78 A: i mean i guess i would be a little more cautious going places in general just i've always felt a little uncomfortable with how americans are viewed in that [laughter] some senses we deserve the way that we're viewed but just 

152.62 153.52 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

152.99 167.02 A: i don't know that we're very disconnected from the international world and i don't i i feel a little uncomfortable about that but not not necessarily for my own safety except perhaps in the middle east i would i would not probably visit there now 

165.08 166.23 B: yeah 

166.48 179.91 B: yeah well i n- i didn't like to fly i had a really bad flight that had nothing to do with nine eleven [laughter] and i i uh we landed in um right before um tornadoes came into florida 

172.69 173.92 A: yeah 

178.62 180.25 A: oh god ooh 

179.82 194.49 B: and um the weather pattern was moving in we didn't land into the tornadoes but we landed into the weather pattern and after that flight i never wanted to get on another one again in my life you know it was like let me off right now i don't wanna be on here and i you know you don't land 

185.83 187.13 A: oh man 

189.54 190.93 A: yeah [laughter] 

191.32 192.67 A: yeah 

194.36 205.36 B: so i- i can't say that i like i haven't liked to fly since then and i can't say that i'd like to fly less now because i 

200.36 202.46 A: no i wouldn't either 

203.97 205.23 A: right 

205.50 219.80 B: although i g- i've gotta say that every once in a while when the terrorist alert goes off or something like that happens i think [noise] more about it being in a public place or in a big place or 

210.80 211.79 A: (( mm )) 

219.50 220.74 A: yeah 

219.74 224.38 B: on public transportation or [mn] say like over um 

224.67 233.57 B: the school vacations here where where uh quite a few of my friends and relatives were gonna be traveling when they raise the terrorist alert right in 

232.70 234.21 A: mhm 

233.54 240.20 B: in and i i guess [noise] you know i think of it more like that [noise] but i don't know if i've really other than that 

240.46 253.78 B: done anything i mean i didn't even buy duct tape or whatever it is [laughter] they were saying did you i mean i have we have duct tape but i mean well there's h- hardly any on the roll and it's um you know it's g- it's because it 

241.46 242.73 A: yeah 

243.69 245.35 A: [laughter] 

247.34 249.02 A: [laughter] 

250.76 251.97 A: [laughter] 

253.80 261.97 B: you know holds everything together that we've got it it's not did you do anything precautionary like that or put in water or extra food or 

256.12 257.63 A: yeah 

261.26 263.05 A: (( not really i mean i )) 

262.93 269.80 A: i guess i feel [laughter] prepared enough but that if something were to happen that that stuff wasn't really [laughter] gonna help me anyway but [sigh] 

268.91 270.26 B: yeah 

269.65 280.80 A: i mean i i don't i don't go around living in fear but when you know when i hear something on the news about the alert and everything i think more about it being on the ground and being in public places like you said that's mhm 

280.92 286.33 B: yeah and i guess if i was inclined to travel outside of the country 

286.34 299.09 B: there would be any number of countries right now that i would be disinclined to visit [laughter] you know what i mean and like you say the middle east i would love to at some point you know see like israel or whatever and 

290.27 294.17 A: yeah yeah it's really unfortunate 

297.98 299.72 A: yeah 

298.88 307.10 B: and i would absolutely never go there but we don't really have the money to do that anyway so it's kind of a moot point but 

302.41 303.66 A: (( right [sigh] )) 

306.65 307.62 A: right 

307.23 316.44 B: should if i was rich enough to do it i most certainly you're like you would not visit there right now i just think it i i kinda think it'd be crazy 

312.46 313.73 A: yeah 

316.06 323.60 A: well totally off topic but i'm a poor college student and i [laughter] i did it but you just have to make a lot of sacrifices like i 

323.55 324.53 B: right 

323.77 331.12 A: um definitely sleeping in hostels and sometimes sleeping on benches [laughter] so it just depends how comfort you wanna have 

326.16 327.22 B: right 

327.59 328.75 B: yeah 

330.13 340.95 B: yeah well i- in it depends on who you see i have a five year old and a two year old so well i mean y- you know if i did it or my my husband and i did it it'd be one thing 

335.11 337.51 A: right i'd be a little different 

339.90 341.45 A: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

341.77 347.77 B: and and i think that that probably has changed my thinking probably more even than 

347.97 354.85 B: the terrorism and stuff and that is to have a five year old and a two year old that any decisions i make that endanger 

348.98 350.23 A: yeah 

353.33 354.20 A: (( mm )) 

354.88 357.07 B: my own personal safety 

357.48 358.99 B: impacts 

359.11 369.83 B: you know their right to have a mother [laughter] you know what i mean and i i just don't really feel like i have the right to make decisions that impair on my wellbeing knowingly 

361.22 362.50 A: yeah 

368.65 370.70 A: (( [sigh] yeah yeah yeah )) 

370.12 373.02 B: you know because you know well 

373.06 377.89 B: like i say you know i should you know i've taken out a commitment of two children i should be 

377.09 378.73 A: yeah [laughter] 

377.99 381.83 B: take on a commitment to raise them if i can so but 

380.37 381.48 A: (( mm [sigh] i guess )) 

381.86 382.90 B: um 

383.36 392.34 B: [lipsmack] but that's so how about like with the phi- like would you go like the philippines or some of those other kinds of places just just not the mi- middle east 

391.60 400.85 A: yeah i guess i would still go i'm i'm going to japan in the fall and i i mean i just not really that fond of flying in the first place and that's a big flight and i 

400.65 401.75 B: yeah 

401.18 404.57 A: but i i wouldn't not go there because of this so 

405.13 408.41 B: mm although although sars might give you a thought [laughter] 

406.80 411.75 A: yeah that that's [laughter] another concern and and the whole scene in 

409.33 410.90 B: yeah another whole 

411.25 412.56 B: (( whole another thing )) 

411.91 419.97 A: korea is a little bit troubling and i'm not really too up on how the relations are with japan right now what's going on with that but i 

419.86 420.88 B: right 

420.65 425.01 A: i don't think that this the nine eleven would affect me going [sigh] 

423.94 438.49 B: right well and i i think nine eleven i would feel very i i would still feel like we um adopted our children had they come from korea we were thinking um and actually in the works to a- adopt someone from korea 

434.11 434.93 A: (( mm )) 

438.42 439.68 A: oh wow 

438.50 443.09 B: um [lipsmack] and also i would've considered china 

443.02 451.95 B: and had my children been in those countries nothing would've stopped me [laughter] i don't care what the flight was like or whatever i would've been on it 

447.93 449.17 A: yeah 

449.72 450.95 A: (( yeah that's true )) 

451.88 458.19 B: um so that wouldn't have changed at all you know and i i would still you know go to those countries although 

454.91 455.64 A: huh 

458.10 467.39 B: uh it would give me pause not that you can but it would give me definitely give me pause to adopt from the middle east [laughter] or or somewhere like that i i don't know if i would wanna go there 

463.09 464.40 A: (( yeah it )) 

466.25 469.09 A: might be kind of precarious yeah 

468.26 473.88 B: e- even south america i mean there's some places down there right now that i'm not so sure 

473.40 475.06 A: (( [sigh] mhm )) 

474.14 474.70 B: (( [mn] )) 

474.71 477.46 B: you know where you just really feel well 

476.53 490.35 A: yeah that's one place where i i would love to go but i would definitely want to have a strong base there and know people and speak the language and have have some way another than just being a tourist i would not feel comfortable doing that mm right 

483.30 484.26 B: right 

484.76 485.84 B: right 

489.62 502.63 B: right well and it's you think too when there's when there's warnings on you know the websites um from the united states and they warn against certain areas or certain countries 

502.99 507.53 B: they don't do it lightly i don't believe you know what i mean and so i think 

505.29 506.19 A: huh 

508.60 523.14 B: i i think when you knowingly put yourself into danger like if they put a warning out on a on a country becau- they usually do it i mean there's gotta be a pretty high level of unrest there for them to put the warning on and if you knowingly go there 

511.60 512.70 A: (( mhm huh )) 

519.84 521.22 A: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

523.43 527.41 B: not that people deserve it but you know they they are really 

527.95 530.29 B: accepting a a level of risk 

528.92 531.31 A: yeah you should know you're taking that risk 

530.27 535.35 B: in their own hands you know what i mean and and then when something happens 

531.43 532.57 A: yeah 

535.32 547.01 B: it's not quite like the people in the twin towers that all their whole entire crime was they went to work you know what i mean i- it's you know i don't know it just is a kind of a difference to it 

540.73 542.02 A: (( yeah yeah [laughter] )) 

544.44 545.71 A: that's true 

546.07 547.60 A: yeah 

547.29 551.66 B: but i don't i don't think there is any part of the united states i wouldn't feel safe in 

551.26 552.73 A: yeah 

552.09 553.47 B: although i think 

553.46 555.55 A: i did one time 

555.62 559.31 A: i a couple of weeks ago there was well maybe it was more than that i don't remember 

559.17 572.30 A: a month or so ago there was supposed to be a huge protest in new york and [sigh] my friend invited me to go and i was asking about the best way to get there and he said just don't drive it's crazy there's all these security measures here so i guess that influenced me more than 

572.12 578.49 A: feeling i was going to be in danger just feeling that there were checkpoints and it would be a big inconvenience to travel there at that point 

578.10 580.62 B: s- yeah so i guess that kinda in a way 

580.17 581.36 A: yeah 

581.34 582.46 B: you know that 

582.24 582.99 A: [sigh] 

582.42 590.49 B: was not really what the first thing you would think of as nine e- eleven but it's the whole security measures things and and what you have to do and 

585.10 586.27 A: right 

587.74 588.81 A: yeah 

590.26 599.90 B: that they're gonna confiscate your um fingernail clipper [laughter] when you go on the airplane i mean there's a few of those kind of things and i and i guess those ways have changed too like i think 

593.91 594.99 A: yeah
