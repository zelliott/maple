5.40 9.00 B: my name is gerry i'm from scotland south dakota 

8.22 12.17 A: wow fantastic [laughter] how's the weather up there today 

11.79 13.86 B: oh nice actually 

12.98 20.87 A: well good good [laughter] well i guess our topic is um what changes we have made to our lives after september eleventh 

20.79 23.03 B: yeah 

21.46 26.48 A: yeah well i can honestly say i don't think i've made really many changes at all 

27.39 28.16 B: (( no )) 

27.97 28.90 A: no 

29.32 31.12 A: um i i 

31.13 36.51 A: am what some people would cons- um consider a religious person i am a christian 

36.71 39.20 A: and so i don't think my 

39.32 43.51 A: spirituality has changed any or deepened any more since that time 

44.43 46.36 A: um i've 

46.84 50.06 A: tried to make every effort to 

51.34 52.35 A: still 

52.52 56.95 A: accept different people because i know that with the attacks um 

57.51 58.31 A: um 

58.39 61.33 A: um what would you say middle eastern people 

61.07 62.91 B: right 

61.48 67.16 A: were kinda being targeted from that and so being very i guess i'm being more cautious and trying to 

67.44 69.24 A: not um 

69.48 76.03 A: you know separate them out from everyone else because i know that there are very you know a lot of middle eastern people that have nothing to do with that 

75.51 77.97 B: right not all of them are terrorists 

77.31 82.45 A: right right what do you think you've done differently or have you done differently 

81.52 88.60 B: well actually i've i've had a lot of changes since then um right around that time i was a cab driver in chicago 

88.35 89.29 A: mhm 

89.02 97.82 B: and um [mn] you know when they shut down the airports and everything and everybody was scared to travel and i mean it put a big dent in the taxi industry 

94.44 95.32 A: right 

97.65 98.71 A: right 

98.28 99.55 B: and ah 

100.09 112.12 B: you know i did what i could for a while and then one day my cab broke down in front of the chicago board of trade and i you know i couldn't move it i tried to call a tow truck and i had you know these people screaming at me 

106.02 106.77 A: (( yes )) 

112.09 119.93 B: you know that were doing security around all those buildings and stuff you know the you know that i had to move the cab they were gonna tow it blah blah blah 'cause 

114.75 116.75 A: oh wow right 

119.94 129.18 B: then one one some kind of officer checked it to make sure there wasn't a bomb in there just because you know it was the chicago board of trade it was like two weeks after nine eleven 

128.79 129.81 A: right 

129.93 131.09 B: and ah 

131.58 133.79 B: you know it was just crazy 

134.36 141.56 B: i guess aware because everyone kept thinking you know chicago's the next target they were gonna hit the sears tower or something and ah 

139.56 141.66 A: right yeah right 

142.08 152.35 B: so ah so i decided you know the heck with this and actually moved to a town of like eight hundred people in south dakota and ah no terrorist threats here [laughter] 

147.07 148.94 A: [laughter] 

150.95 153.85 A: no that's for sure that is really for sure 

152.83 159.31 B: the worst thing the worst somebody might do is hijack a a crop duster and crash it in a field you know 

158.45 167.34 A: right right but because of the smaller community everyone knows everyone else and so everyone is more aware of odd things going on 

162.33 165.25 B: yeah 

165.26 166.40 B: yeah 'cause i know 

166.91 172.76 B: 'cause i know when we moved here you know everyone was like oh hi hi you know they were kinda giving us a weird look 

173.07 182.71 B: you know making sure we were you know not of arab descent pretty much i mean one someone actually came out and said well i'm glad you're white you know it was kind of like well you know 

176.62 177.56 A: right 

180.59 181.59 A: yeah 

182.48 189.39 B: you do something like that in chicago and you're gonna have you know jesse jackson and company in front of your house chanting [laughter] but 

187.54 191.01 A: right very true very very true [laughter] 

190.91 204.68 B: i mean out here you know everybody knows everybody and ah you know like i doubt you know you're gonna have one of those terrorist sleeper cells or anything out here but i guess it's good i mean i i feel safer here than i did in chicago 

198.41 199.64 A: [noise] right 

205.29 206.45 B: and ah 

207.47 219.81 B: i don't know i guess you know that whole nine eleven thing it it ah i guess it played a big role in my life because if it didn't happen you know the travel industry wouldn't have died and i'd probably still be driving a cab 

219.30 222.94 A: right and that is a huge change for you to move from 

223.02 226.99 A: the huge metropolis of chicago to a town of eight hundred people 

226.22 227.48 B: (( yeah )) 

227.13 229.81 A: you know that that's a very huge life change 

229.18 236.92 B: yeah you go you go from not being able to hear an airplane fly over your house to you know realizing that your toaster actually makes noise when it's on 

235.66 238.01 A: (( [laughter] that's very true )) 

237.71 240.10 B: [laughter] very weird 

238.15 239.63 A: that's very true 

239.96 245.23 A: i i thought i made a similar change when i moved from southern california out to the midwest 

245.28 250.45 A: manhattan is a small town of only about fifty thousand people and i thought wow that's small 

248.28 249.96 B: yeah 

250.45 251.57 B: (( [laughter] no )) 

250.51 253.83 A: but not quite as drastic of a change as you've made so 

254.46 255.36 A: um 

255.51 257.84 A: really like i said you know um 

259.51 267.16 A: [sigh] you know possibly a change that occurred in me was you know realizing that these things could happen on our soil 

267.44 272.44 A: outside of our own selves i mean we had the oklahoma city bombing but that was from within [noise] 

271.85 273.58 B: yeah 

273.04 275.24 A: and um 

275.51 285.38 A: i think it was good because it helped break the i think in some ways the arrogance that many people may have had thinking that we're invincible 

282.50 284.28 B: yeah 

285.67 286.73 A: and 

287.28 291.94 A: i think it helped bring a lot of people together as a sense of a community the whole nation 

292.62 295.17 A: and realizing that we have to 

295.50 299.41 A: really support one another and encourage one another 

300.46 312.71 A: and you know reach out of our own selves and not be you know closed off to everyone because without that sense of community it it's very difficult and i think you probably see a lot of that within your own town 

305.70 307.46 B: mhm 

312.82 314.59 B: right 

313.11 318.78 A: because of the sense of community there there's a stronger unity and 

315.70 317.03 B: (( yeah 'cause i mean )) 

318.83 321.94 A: um [noise] you can you can trust and rely on more people that way 

321.98 324.02 B: right 

323.00 323.87 A: so 

324.44 326.46 A: but like i said you know um [lipsmack] 

327.65 331.38 A: i don't think my life really has changed much since then 

331.59 332.56 A: um 

334.56 336.50 A: i mean i was on a plane 

336.53 338.42 A: going across the country 

338.43 342.06 A: not but you know four weeks after september eleventh so 

342.90 343.86 A: um 

344.31 346.52 A: the flight really didn't 

346.62 352.47 A: bother me because i guess i figured you know if it's my time to go it is and there's nothing i can do 

350.40 351.25 B: mhm 

353.18 355.04 A: to change that so 

355.99 356.72 A: um 

356.85 361.76 A: but you know it does it does remind me that 

362.92 367.71 A: you know we're not guaranteed tomorrow [mn] and so i do have to live my life 

367.91 370.52 A: every single day to the best of my abilities 

371.18 372.39 A: and um 

373.03 374.16 A: you know i guess 

374.63 378.25 A: i guess i try to keep a better eye on things that are happening around me 

378.85 385.19 A: you know if there's any suspicious activity then i want to be aware of it and you know not um 

386.48 388.35 A: not go around i guess 

390.75 393.40 A: um totally absorbed within myself so 

393.50 394.26 B: (( mm )) 

396.87 400.53 B: all of the the i mean i think now that ah 

397.25 397.81 A: (( yeah )) 

400.73 407.09 B: you know i 'cause i guess a lot of a lot of those terrorists that were on the plane they weren't in the country legally 

407.72 408.66 A: right 

408.51 414.31 B: and ah i mean i think i think i write my congressman more about you know enforcing immigration laws 

414.71 417.11 B: i think that plays a big role in it too 

417.31 419.05 A: very true very true 

418.26 430.91 B: you know and i think i think a lot of it i think as far as the country like you said you know a lot of people are arrogant and they think it can't happen to them but you know three thousand over three thousand people are learned that you know hey it can happen to you 

430.64 431.66 A: right 

433.43 438.75 B: so i'm very make the the whole country more conscious of what's going on 

437.37 438.41 A: right 

438.48 439.78 A: right 

439.11 441.96 B: instead of worrying about their car payment and stuff you know 

441.70 443.39 A: right [laughter] right 

443.11 450.36 B: putting their kids in yeah yeah i'm out should i should i buy a boat or buy some plastic and duct tape 

443.49 445.92 A: should i buy the boat or should i not you know 

450.11 451.19 A: right 

450.77 452.27 B: [laughter] 

451.21 463.48 A: which you know let me ask you if i can you know have you taken those kind of steps for your family to buy things that you think would be necessary around your home in case there were a terrorist attack around your area 

462.84 465.36 B: not really i mean 

465.94 469.64 A: do you feel that's because you're in a small town yeah yeah 

468.02 478.38 B: yeah i mean i'm basically forty miles from nothing um i would have to drive an hour to go to mcdonald's i i mean there would be no i mean the only 

471.85 473.64 A: [laughter] 

475.60 476.58 A: right 

478.17 483.77 B: target i think that they would do in in south dakota would be maybe mount rushmore 

483.66 484.81 A: yeah 

484.76 485.69 B: (( you know )) 

484.82 485.68 A: which 

486.46 488.89 B: but ah [noise] you know that would just 

488.97 495.39 B: anyone that wants to plash a crane crash a plane into a pile of granite you know that's their own problem i guess 

495.00 498.90 A: [laughter] they'll probably do more damage to themself than anything else yeah 

495.96 500.63 B: [laughter] yeah it's not gonna it's not gonna give you know you might 

500.83 506.07 B: chip george washington's nose but that would be the extent of it 

502.58 504.69 A: [laughter] 

505.22 506.27 A: right 

506.43 509.43 A: and that's and that's the same for myself um 

511.19 516.34 A: um being in a smaller town [noise] i don't feel like there's any immediate danger 

516.68 524.98 A: and i've always tried to keep you know extra food on hand so that in case you know we had a tornado rip through here that we would have some kind of staples but um 

523.66 525.55 B: yeah 

524.79 533.86 A: you know even my canned goods aren't guaranteed to survive a tornado so you know still that's even kind of difficult to try and plan for but i i haven't gone out and bought any plastic 

533.95 536.53 A: or duct tape or anything um 

536.78 551.28 B: yeah well there there was actually i think there was a family in israel you know they were worried about you know with us attacking iraq and everything they they wrapped their house in plastic and ah they they forgot to let air in and they suffocated 

551.03 552.94 A: oh my [noise] 

552.05 562.97 B: you know so i'm i'm like you know do i want to wrap my house in plastic and suffocate or you know just take my chances with you know terrorists bombing the heartland of america and i think i'll take my chances you know 

560.31 561.66 A: right 

562.94 572.59 A: and i and i think well i think yeah in that case you know that nothing is guaranteed to us and we really don't know if something like that's gonna happen and we can go to either extreme and be totally arrogant 

569.63 571.31 B: yeah 

572.63 575.13 A: or we could come to a state of panic 

575.43 581.58 A: but um you know i think with like [mn] if they were to drop anthrax like you said from a plane 

581.52 583.42 B: yeah 

581.94 583.81 A: or something like that i think 

584.22 588.09 A: you would have to literally wrap your whole house in plastic 

587.59 591.94 B: yeah and then have oxygen in tanks and 

590.49 592.91 A: yeah and um 

592.97 595.60 A: i'm not willing to go to that extreme so 

594.98 599.35 B: yeah if it's my time to go it's my time to go you know 

597.69 599.89 A: well right yeah exactly you know [mn]
