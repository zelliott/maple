18.02 20.61 B: okay well then you kinda know what you're doing 

18.44 19.29 A: (( mhm )) 

20.50 25.23 A: okay well um what we do is um talk about um 

25.34 31.59 A: um nine eleven and if uh that has affected our life or what we've done since nine eleven 

26.94 27.77 B: right 

31.70 34.38 B: [sigh] god how could it not affect our lives 

34.08 36.55 A: correct um it was 

35.03 37.21 B: or at least that's how i feel i don't know 

36.97 38.98 A: yes it was it was uh 

39.27 45.54 A: a tragedy and an awaking- awakening for us um and our freedoms 

46.48 50.13 B: and like everything we took for granted or at least i think most people 

50.06 51.20 A: (( [noise] correct )) 

50.43 54.38 B: take for granted everything we've got here my daughter's nineteen 

54.50 58.46 B: but she just doesn't seem to get the concept of what the freedom is 

58.62 64.04 B: she can sit here and she just says blah blah blah blah blah i don't like the president on and on and on 

64.49 67.99 B: but i said do you not understand because you live here you can say that 

67.97 68.95 A: correct 

68.17 74.52 B: and and you can go to other countries and you can't say that or you can say it but you may die for it so 

72.82 73.90 A: mhm 

74.92 76.23 B: [lipsmack] not every- 

75.98 85.41 A: uh let's see uh effectiveness for um my immediate family my cousin was actually flying into new york 

84.71 86.81 B: (( uh oh [noise] [sigh] [noise] )) 

86.21 94.35 A: um with her daughter to see uh my uncle and aunt in new york and he was there at the airport to pick her up 

94.44 100.02 A: so they were affected in a way that they literally 

100.38 103.90 A: packed their bags and left new york for a while 

105.76 106.94 A: um 

106.99 109.01 A: luckily um 

109.12 114.71 A: we didn't know anyone immediately in any of the the buildings but 

114.83 119.85 A: um being that our cousins lived there we know some of the people that 

120.24 125.81 A: uh one of 'em were friends so it it affected them even worse 

125.85 131.24 A: if you could think of your own home town or where you live and one of the buildings being 

128.57 129.63 B: right 

131.71 134.29 A: or two buildings being um 

134.39 137.78 A: destroyed in that manner um it 

136.21 142.87 B: well of c- i mean of course i i think people in new york had to have to felt it stronger than i did because i'm so far away 

140.86 148.27 A: and then the then the right and then the people that actually uh went to the buildings to save people and then 

148.36 152.36 A: their families were injured and they lost a lotta lives so 

152.62 153.64 A: um 

154.30 167.47 A: it affected a lotta people in new york and then it it really made its way here because some of our firemen and policemen went and offered their services so i think it affected the whole united states 

162.52 163.33 B: right 

163.49 164.62 B: right 

168.15 169.70 A: and um 

169.99 173.38 A: and in my job place because we were um 

174.27 188.19 A: actually uh accepting shipments from other countries it sorta put us at a standstill and a lotta restrictions were put on to the containers coming in and it hurt the economy here 

188.43 190.77 A: um for a few months 

191.28 199.45 A: and uh literally um i was asked to go part time with my job which then affected me so 

199.52 201.69 A: um it has affected 

202.55 204.55 A: um our lives here 

204.66 207.02 A: even though we don't live in new york 

207.08 208.22 A: how about you 

207.15 218.37 B: well i i think [mn] well i think it just affected all of us although no it's not that seriously i actually own a cleaning service so you wouldn't think that would be affective however 

214.83 216.00 A: mhm 

219.05 230.34 B: because the cleaning getting your house cleaned or whatever it's kind of a luxury i guess uh several customers you know would call in and cancel so i had to let two of my employees go 

230.19 232.44 A: right see mhm 

230.38 243.60 B: because there just wasn't enough work so i- you know in a roundabout way it did affect me in the the first two months following it because everybody you know got a little nervous what's gonna happen will i still have a job and so of course they were you know house cleaning is your first thing to go 

234.71 236.71 A: oh yeah 

244.31 250.78 A: oh yeah luxuries and and i was selling um antique furniture and actually um 

245.34 246.15 B: so 

250.94 255.11 A: uh furniture from asia and different parts of the world so 

255.24 256.13 A: (( [noise] um )) 

256.45 257.64 A: even though 

258.17 264.55 A: that was just like a luxury par- um piece too so [noise] um it did uh 

261.85 262.79 B: right 

264.82 276.27 A: hurt our economy [noise] um and then we are a travel city 'cause we're right on the ocean and and so it hurt uh even our travel people and hotels so yes it wa- it affected us um 

276.81 279.99 A: [lipsmack] here and um of course um 

280.63 282.95 A: [lipsmack] everyone uh moves on 

282.96 287.54 A: and then um actually uh we just traveled out of the country 

287.73 289.42 A: uh recently 

289.89 300.59 A: and luckily we went to a a place that like americans and um we wouldn't have gone otherwise so it affects your travel plans too 

293.36 295.19 B: (( [laughter] )) 

300.64 306.44 B: well i- i'm sure uh obviously greyhound's uh ticket sales went up greatly last year after 

306.64 320.18 B: you know after the airline after everything happened because people didn't wanna fly anymore i don't like to fly but see i've never flown and i didn't wanna fly before this happened so [laughter] in that aspect it didn't affect me because i never wanted to fly anyway 

311.44 312.82 A: (( correct [sigh] mhm )) 

321.95 324.86 B: [sigh] but y- you know and in truly 

324.73 337.70 B: it's for the rest of your life i mean this is kinda like and of course i was too young to remember when kennedy got shot i was only a year old but my i can remember my my mother saying i'll always remember where i was when kennedy was shot well i'll always remember exactly what i was doing 

337.83 343.08 B: when i heard a plane had flown into the towers and i'll never forget it 

343.06 344.65 A: yeah i was at work 

344.88 349.31 B: yeah i was at work and someone and i didn't have a radio or a t._v. in my office 

345.97 346.99 A: mhm 

348.50 354.83 A: yeah somebody go- yeah mhm yeah they called us you won't believe yeah what happened 

349.42 353.02 B: neither one somebody called me and said oh my god are you watching this 

354.40 362.10 B: and and it just so happened the radio in my car had blown up the day before i couldn't even go out to my car and listen so i just shut the office down and went home 

362.14 364.74 B: because i i just couldn't believe it was going on 

365.16 366.81 B: i said no you must be wrong 

367.40 369.97 B: but unfortunately she wasn't 

370.26 373.39 A: and i think it woke up uh uh the government 

374.59 375.80 B: well hopefully 

377.44 378.43 A: and uh 

377.60 381.43 B: but i i i don't know i see it as something that they wanna i mean this is like 

382.17 388.36 B: [lipsmack] i don't know i don't know anything else so traumatic but i don't think it's something we'll ever forget hopefully we don't ever forget 

389.16 393.24 B: i think we that maybe too many americans were taking too much for granted 

394.72 397.64 B: and so now we appreciate a little more what we've got [noise] [noise] 

397.88 400.79 A: i believe so i believe that that's exactly uh 

400.80 408.95 A: um it hit home and then i- i- it uh it did make uh people realize um the simpler things and that um 

408.99 411.54 A: family uh meant a lot more 

411.85 412.85 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

413.34 414.61 A: and uh 

414.85 419.79 A: i remember one of the stories that uh one of the girls um 

419.89 423.57 A: had been in a building before that had been hit 

423.70 429.14 A: or wasn't she one of the ones that um um part of the building collapsed 

429.37 434.15 A: and they rebuilt it and then she went back to work in the in the same building 

433.54 434.55 B: (( right [mn] )) 

434.79 442.48 A: and then she you know she was here again in this building and she said well you know her livelihood has changed definitely 

435.12 436.18 B: (( [noise] )) 

445.07 452.50 B: i think for a lotta people it just changed your whole outlook on life i mean i don't know i mean i don't mean dramatically i just don't do a whole lotta things different but i 

447.78 448.57 A: (( so mhm )) 

452.66 455.65 B: i think a little more before i say or do something 

457.04 461.47 A: i know it has affected the uh um airlines as i said uh 

461.57 466.00 A: um we were told not to take you know like even 

466.20 473.97 A: my husband was told that he smokes and he couldn't take his lighter so he had to dispose of his lighter 

474.38 487.13 A: um and he was like well why i'm not gonna you know light somebody [laughter] but they don't know that so i said just do it i mean what what are you arguing about you can buy matches 

477.85 478.54 B: (( [sigh] [laughter] )) 

479.89 482.17 B: but they don't know that yeah 

486.69 497.61 B: and of cour- like i said i've never flown but i i and i mean of course watching the news and hearing from friends that do i know that things are dramatically changed that you've gotta get there two hours early and you've gotta go through all this check through and 

487.18 488.06 A: you know 

496.92 501.31 A: yes you can't put mhm correct mhm [lipsmack] 

497.42 501.82 B: you can't park at the drop off place and you can't do this and i'm like boy 

502.22 506.65 A: and they check in the you know you're a suspect i guess 

506.84 511.57 A: um i feel it's a s- a safety feature though um for us all 

510.01 512.42 B: [mn] and and i kinda feel like 

512.78 515.73 B: i don't know maybe not to this extreme but i kinda feel like 

515.84 521.76 B: [mn] should've been doing this all along maybe we should've been a little more careful about checking people that got onto planes 

521.36 522.32 A: mhm 

522.67 529.30 A: yeah because how did they come over here and with their visas and when we're 

529.40 537.09 A: uh letting immigrants in and i know we're all immigrants in one time or another but weren't we you know 

533.68 534.65 B: right 

537.30 543.62 A: they used to go through almost like if you were sick you were quarantined and and we don't do that anymore 

543.23 545.46 B: right you can just come over here 

545.54 548.79 A: yeah you can get in a boat and come over 

547.77 556.80 B: and uh you can just [mn] right and and i don't wanna say oh well we can't let people in anymore but it to me it's almost it's almost to that point 

553.11 554.05 A: no 

556.94 569.26 B: because [mn] i don't know there there's just a lotta people i think or i know there were several people that have actually come over from other countries get their college degrees here learn everything they can learn and go back to their country to use it against us 

570.57 571.98 A: (( correct )) 

571.08 571.96 B: well 

572.51 574.63 B: so that doesn't seem like a great idea 

572.74 585.33 A: so we i'd i i hope we've all learned something to um this tragedy and and i know they're rebuilding which is positive and and i think they're gonna do like some kind of a memorial 

581.92 582.98 B: right 

585.58 587.15 A: and um 

587.95 589.58 A: i know the out 

589.59 590.69 A: the uh 

591.65 595.48 A: you never want a terrorist to come over and uh 

595.63 596.50 A: um 

596.77 599.89 A: hurt your country but uh
