517.86 518.63 A: (( have )) 

520.32 530.41 B: and back and then you switch to the front and it has the round thing that you do the swirlies and then it has little bar bells going up the handlebars different weights 

528.48 529.30 A: oh 

530.20 532.62 A: so you can do a little different modification 

531.37 534.67 B: yeah so maybe if i did the front thing the 

534.70 537.51 B: swiveling that might help my belly 

536.14 537.12 A: uh-huh 

537.23 538.69 A: are you a smoker too
