18.33 21.61 B: little things like spending more time with your family or something 

19.17 20.22 A: um 

21.90 29.45 A: um well i did a lot of that anyway i think i think a lot of it was like changing negative behavior and thoughts 

23.88 25.55 B: (( [laughter] )) 

29.35 30.78 B: yes 

30.17 35.32 A: because um you know like most people after that anybody who was not

38.38 39.07 B: (( [noise] )) 

38.58 41.11 A: a lighter shade of white 

41.69 42.74 B: yeah 

41.85 44.85 A: or anything in the in the middle was a terrorist 

44.42 46.26 B: oh 

45.14 54.81 A: you know it was like you know the guy that i'd been buying gas from for three years now all of a sudden yeah here is my money he's supporting this terrorist guy

63.66 74.23 A: and you know a lot of that i had to sit down and you know think about this mindset it was like okay i really need to change that because everybody you meet on the street were not the same people flying those planes 

63.72 64.76 B: yeah 

73.55 74.60 B: right 

74.93 82.79 B: well the the problem that i had i found out that i had was that one of the guys who was actually the one of the terrorists 

82.80 89.25 B: um was from florida and lived not far from my mom and dad who live in florida and [noise] 

89.36 93.94 B: went t- the guy went to the same place my my mom got her hair cut

98.76 100.36 B: in your neighborhood 

99.79 101.68 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

100.63 104.54 B: and it was it wa- it took me a couple of months to go you know what 

104.58 107.91 B: you you can't you can't live like that so 

108.12 110.79 B: but i don't think i i've changed anything 

111.05 116.74 B: physically i mean not too much i mean we didn't go buy gas masks we didn't do that we 

117.08 122.61 B: we were we've just done little things like spend more time quality time with family and 

123.05 126.24 B: and just do the little things and not 

126.61 131.43 B: try not to stress out about all the big stuff [laughter] but 

130.52 138.88 A: i know um [lipsmack] one of the things i i did was like people that you used to just think about you know that you hadn't talked to or seen in a long time 

138.67 139.77 B: oh 

138.91 148.48 A: um but you would just give 'em a passing thought i wonder how such and such from high school is or such and such from co- you know yeah i started you know to um contact those people 

142.85 145.38 B: oh yeah did you end up calling anybody 

148.41 149.48 B: oh did you 

148.69 156.33 A: because yeah because you just never know you know when you'll be thinking about somebody and [noise] you know what if they were in that building 

156.18 159.23 B: oh did you end up knowing anybody in new york 

156.61 157.61 A: you know 

158.84 169.60 A: um yeah well i have some family members in new york that work close by but [noise] nobody in that building and my husband his friend used to work in that building but he's not there anymore so

167.79 168.51 B: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

168.65 170.71 B: really that's eerie isn't it 

170.01 177.66 A: so that was good and i have some other family members [noise] whose lives have not really fared well you know um 

176.13 177.36 B: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

178.03 189.51 A: [noise] one is battling substance abuse and the other two are incarcerated and you know it was crazy because i was thinking wow i'm sure glad they're deadbeats because had they been working they might have died in this building 

186.27 188.76 B: (( [noise] had they had they been )) 

189.09 192.64 B: oh that's that's sad either way though it's scary 

191.23 197.71 A: [noise] y- y- yeah it is [noise] [mn] [noise] and [noise] 

194.34 195.66 B: wow 

196.37 200.22 B: but yeah we haven't we haven't seemed to change too much [noise] we 

200.70 204.85 B: i mean we didn't we didn't cut back on the amount we flew or anything 

205.04 211.49 B: [noise] so 'cause my husband works for the airlines so we didn't we didn't cut back on you know 

211.69 217.00 B: flying or too much [noise] although i was nervous the first time that 

216.09 219.44 A: yeah that's what i was gonna ask you was there any apprehension at all 

219.11 222.83 B: yeah i- i- but i was flying with my children [noise] 

222.71 223.65 A: (( mm )) 

222.94 226.52 B: so you really couldn't go you know what i mean you couldn't wig out 

226.55 227.69 A: [laughter] 

226.55 227.76 B: because 

227.77 233.88 B: [laughter] you know you you don't wanna you don't wanna put that on them either 

231.49 232.86 A: (( [noise] )) 

233.25 234.49 A: right 

234.17 240.57 B: so and we talked to we talked to my you know especially [noise] my oldest child and you know was asking him how 

241.19 250.53 B: how he felt about everything and he was he said he was pretty not nervous about everything that was going on 

251.22 252.06 B: (( [noise] so )) 

252.16 253.43 A: how old is he 

253.29 254.67 B: he's ten 

254.39 255.42 A: okay 

255.15 258.03 B: so you know pretty pretty verbal and everything 

257.67 259.62 A: yeah 

258.63 263.51 B: but um we didn't talk about it too much with the seven year old only because of the fact that 

264.60 267.14 B: i mean you know he was asking why 

267.76 269.44 A: and you know what do you 

268.57 270.39 B: how do you explain that 

269.49 273.90 A: yeah you know they really don't like us so they just did this i mean 

272.92 276.00 B: yeah i said they were bad people who made a 

276.13 283.37 B: bad decisions and bad things happened and you know i mean o- other than that h- what are you supposed to say 

283.82 285.13 B: [noise] so 

285.53 295.19 A: and i think um something else i was um just b- remembering now was how angry i was to see them over there laughing and dancing and celebrating 

295.21 296.41 B: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

295.48 305.22 A: when you know we have never you know if we've ever done anything as far as killing people we have never over here laughed and danced and had parties in the street 

304.72 306.53 B: i know i mean that's just [noise] 

306.95 314.04 B: that was that was [noise] so sad because you know that it probably wasn't everybody over there doing that 

314.37 317.25 B: yet that's what they chose to show 

317.86 320.24 B: and it couldn't have been everybody doing that i mean i 

320.34 323.03 B: it's like the people over here protesting the war 

322.91 324.79 A: yeah 

323.79 330.17 B: you know it's not everybody over here that feels that way yet that's what they chose to show [noise] 

328.25 334.93 A: but that's what they show and that's another thing i think i started scrutinizing the media more 

334.79 338.46 B: yeah because you go you know what you're you're egging us on 

334.95 336.36 A: after that 

338.48 341.17 A: yeah basically 

339.41 346.89 B: you know and there's no there is no need for that so [noise] i i did find that i stopped watching a lot of t._v. especially the news 

346.30 347.95 A: mhm 

347.27 349.34 B: um just because of the fact that 

350.00 356.83 B: gosh you know [laughter] i i know there's bad things and i don't need to live them twenty four 

351.52 353.58 A: [lipsmack] [laughter] that [mn] 

356.36 361.45 A: seven yeah 'cause you're reflecting on 'em enough as it is so yeah 

356.87 358.41 B: seven yeah 

360.07 363.98 B: yeah they they impact your your life enough as it is so 

363.72 370.53 A: yeah we pretty much stayed on the cartoon channel and nickelodeon for quite some time after that and even now 

367.31 369.21 B: [noise] [laughter] yeah 

370.57 378.49 A: um so what about the um nation you know terrorist level alert like orange blue green do they mean anything to you 

370.67 371.34 B: [noise] 

375.58 378.38 B: (( [noise] i fou- i found it stressful )) 

378.76 382.92 B: well [sigh] only because of the fact that sometimes we were traveling 

383.14 384.99 B: and so you know 

385.89 387.23 B: (( you you )) 

387.58 390.35 B: you felt more apprehensive i think 

389.70 391.15 A: mhm 

390.66 396.25 B: but [sigh] i mean when they like when they raised it was times like well why 

396.40 401.04 B: why are they raising it why aren't they telling us why they're raising it what you know 

400.69 401.61 A: right 

401.76 407.69 B: and i just sometimes you got too much information and then other times it just seemed like not enough 

407.55 416.70 A: yeah some- th- that's what i felt too i mean i felt like after that you know we needed to be more guarded and all these secrets were coming out on t._v. 

409.26 411.47 B: [noise] 

416.61 417.84 B: yeah 

417.24 418.31 A: you know 

418.54 428.73 A: [noise] but as far as um and looking from a non traveler's standpoint like myself they those alerts those codes and levels don't mean anything to me i mean what's 

428.56 429.80 B: (( [noise] like what do you kno- )) 

428.84 434.00 A: what's an orange what's a red what does that you know translate into in terms of a 

431.26 437.29 B: yeah [laughter] and why does yellow and orange look so similar in color [laughter] 

435.54 444.22 A: yeah you know what i mean what does that translate into lives lost um catastrophic event you know what's an orange a bombing of a caf 

441.21 443.87 B: like what are what are you hearing that i'm not 

444.34 455.35 A: or you know what what's a blue you know a bombing of a a school what i mean what is that you know how are we spo- i mean this is all new to us you know how are we supposed to take that you know i mean 

449.10 450.37 B: yeah 

455.51 465.62 A: we're not from a country where every day is september eleventh we're not from you know israel where this happens daily or you know egypt or some of the countries in africa 

458.06 459.00 B: right 

463.22 465.19 B: or or yeah 

465.51 472.59 B: well i'm what what i was w- worried about when it first happened was that my children's school was in a lock down 

467.12 467.87 A: [noise] 

473.22 474.77 A: yeah 

474.15 485.50 B: and it was it was weird it was just like you know they usually have kids out checking the bus patrol and and doing all that and none of the kids were doing that it was all the teachers it was just 

486.59 491.67 B: it was like wow this is a very serious matter yet i'm not sure 

491.91 494.10 B: how it affects me or or 

494.91 496.79 B: or what to think by it 

497.66 506.02 A: yeah that that was unfortunate because the kids will su- they suffer for that and they'll be suffering the consequences of this for a long time to come 

506.21 507.65 B: yeah that was 

506.42 510.63 A: you know [lipsmack] and i think that was one the bad things about it too 

509.71 513.83 B: well i think any any child no matter their age right now is gonna remember 

513.75 514.34 A: (( [noise] )) 

514.74 520.77 B: what they were doing or where they were kinda like the john f. kennedy of of the previous generation 

520.26 523.73 A: yeah yeah and that [mn] you 

521.80 525.50 B: so they can remember where they were and what they were doing 

525.53 538.01 A: know i save uh the newspaper clippings for them and but you know beyond the same you know we're just reinforcing the discussion my four year old had in his pre k. about the bad men flying the plane into the building 

533.37 534.18 B: [noise] 

537.92 548.65 A: um you know we haven't really touched on it much because i mean when i tell him well they don't like us and i'm still trying to figure out why they don't you know is it because we have more i mean do y- 

543.77 545.72 B: (( [noise] [laughter] yeah and [noise] )) 

548.44 558.09 A: is it like an ideology you know you say you hate western influences but here you are you're riding around in your caravan of yukons okay that's a g._m._c. car 

556.17 557.36 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

558.32 568.50 A: that's a western car so you own all these western things you know saddam hussein likes um frank sinatra can you get any more american than frank sinatra

578.18 581.27 B: [laughter] right but you want our stuff 

580.97 590.47 A: and you know i think before september eleven you know that didn't really bother me nuts but now i'm just like tired of people hating us you know i'm getting to the point now where i'm like fine 

587.80 588.43 B: (( [noise] w- )) 

590.24 596.84 A: let's just pull our troops outta everywhere let 'em fight their own battles give us our money back fend for yourself i've had it
