0.02 3.15 A: hi this is karen mirolton of 

3.28 5.03 A: minnesota 

4.44 8.16 B: hi my name is zoya i'm from maryland 

7.66 8.46 A: okay 

11.82 14.61 A: are we supposed to start talking do you know 

14.35 16.90 B: i- i guess so it's my first call [sigh] 

16.49 20.53 A: [laughter] i'd had one earlier today but um 

19.79 20.46 B: (( o- )) 

20.41 28.24 A: i'm thinking i can't remember i thought that they came on and then they interrupted and said okay your timing will begin now but okay so we can 

27.47 28.34 B: (( oh oh )) 

28.01 35.79 A: talking [laughter] i guess but uh well i work at a a healthcare facility and stuff so 

35.93 38.33 A: for me it's just kind of um 

36.45 37.19 B: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

38.87 40.12 A: we 

40.16 46.41 A: i don't feel very threatened that they're gonna uh any terrorist is gonna come and bomb a hospital or anything 

46.29 47.79 B: (( right [noise] )) 

46.54 55.78 A: so as far as that goes i'm not too worried about it but you know it's it's there in the back of my mind and you see it on the news and stuff and 

55.91 62.23 A: so it's something i think about a lot but uh you know i haven't really changed my life a whole lot 

62.60 73.23 A: um we have some kids so i tend to um be a little bit more careful with them and and uh just knowing where they're at and and whatnot and so that way i guess 

73.30 75.83 A: um it directly affects me but 

76.22 83.15 B: right i i didn't make any changes to my lifestyle either i work at the library so 

82.54 87.59 A: oh okay yeah another s- pretty safe [laughter] work place it's 

85.31 86.52 B: (( the uh )) 

87.45 88.24 B: um 

87.61 91.52 A: not like they're gonna get a big kick out of bombing a library or anything you know 

91.28 100.95 B: [laughter] yeah i'm also worried about my daughter she's only two but um i was actually more worried um when there was like [lipsmack] 

101.07 103.66 B: you remember that washington sniper 

103.27 104.70 A: yeah 

103.95 109.49 B: yeah that was bothering me much more than the terrorist attacks [lipsmack] 

108.75 109.67 A: yeah 

110.32 111.06 B: um 

111.00 119.88 A: yeah 'cause just that ju- they were regular people i mean you know they just kinda i don't even remember how that all ended up if they just kinda went off the deep end or 

119.80 132.95 A: thought they were picking off people that could harm some- the united states in some way or whatever but that that is pretty scary if you think of people that just kinda anybody they could be anybody but just 

131.01 132.59 B: (( so yeah )) 

132.81 144.35 B: yeah you never know when or where it's gonna be and that was scary um i don't think um i think about that a lot i just 

133.20 134.24 A: (( [noise] snap )) 

142.04 143.00 A: yeah 

145.08 147.02 B: i prefer not to think about it [laughter] 

146.79 160.74 A: exactly yeah and you know at at work we have uh normally we just have regular badges that we just use to just time keep and that sort of thing it's just one of those swiping cards kinda like a credit card i guess 

159.76 161.67 B: mhm yeah 

161.04 164.74 A: and uh they're just basic they don't have any words on or anything 

164.91 169.88 A: well now they're gonna go to having pictures and our names on 'em so it's 

168.27 170.06 B: oh right 

170.12 182.62 A: and i from my understanding this in it's in regards to this terrorist thing they're cracking down on security and i suppose anybody could grab anybody's badge and nobody knows who that person is if that's their badge or 

181.28 182.29 B: (( oh right )) 

182.44 188.26 A: you know just 'cause they have a badge i you know you assume that they're they're a worker and stuff but 

188.22 192.27 B: right that reminds me of how this thing also we have um 

192.53 205.25 B: our crisis plan updated and we have more training on evacuation and using the um exits emergency exits and the first aid kits and everything i guess that's in response to 

205.27 207.08 B: those terrorist attacks 

207.99 209.23 A: oh yeah 

208.42 209.70 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

209.84 217.53 A: [lipsmack] but uh um and at my brother in law works at the airport in the city of sierra and 

217.57 227.59 A: he they've been i think it was in regards to september eleventh a lot of people have kind of s- slacked off on traveling and now with this iraqi thing 

226.19 227.30 B: mhm 

227.50 239.72 A: that it just people are just uh not traveling as much and they had to cut back a lot he's he's switched to a later shift and there's a chance that he might get laid off and it's pretty bad 

239.19 252.21 B: [sigh] yeah i guess it is but on the other hand my husband had to travel i in october last year and he got his tickets real cheap and uh there were only three people on the plane at that time 

244.85 245.41 A: (( [mn] )) 

246.04 247.04 A: oh 

251.31 253.06 A: oh my gosh 

252.73 253.61 B: um 

253.57 255.74 A: did he get to sit in first class then 

255.66 256.40 B: uh 

256.64 257.66 A: or did he 

256.81 259.13 B: i don- i don't remember i mean 

259.11 261.91 A: i would think that if just because you bought 

261.97 267.57 A: just because there's rumored first class y- you'd sit where you probably got your tickets at though 

264.24 265.27 B: right 

266.14 268.80 B: i think he still stayed in the coach 

268.60 269.63 A: yeah 

268.86 270.28 B: in the economy 

271.09 272.44 A: (( so he's )) 

272.56 281.02 A: well that's i didn't realize that it was that bad unless he had a really off flight but usually it's at least half full 

281.33 286.93 B: right a- and that flight was to florida so i would expect it be at least half 

285.10 286.34 A: (( geez )) 

287.09 288.01 B: [noise] full 

287.65 293.69 A: yeah especially in october everyone wants to get out of get outta where are you what state are you in 

293.23 294.54 B: uh maryland 

294.32 298.46 A: maryland yeah we have uh relatives that live around there 

298.69 299.51 B: oh 

298.77 308.67 A: in massachusetts kinda kinda by you [laughter] not really i guess [laughter] but closer to you than us [laughter] oh 

301.63 302.55 B: [laughter] 

307.20 312.43 B: wow actually i'm from russia i'm only like two and a half years in this country 

309.89 311.05 A: really 

312.44 314.22 B: uh so it's still like 

313.53 314.82 A: oh my 

315.31 319.42 A: did uh do you have relatives that still live in russia 

318.67 320.52 B: yeah yeah 

320.11 322.30 A: now how does that all affect you 

322.67 323.60 B: (( well )) 

323.84 334.87 B: actually i've been there last year and i'm i'm from st petersburg and they're having a big celebration uh it's uh three hundredth our anniversary of the city 

334.88 335.90 B: um 

336.03 349.27 B: the city is getting ready for the tourism and they expecting a lot of people there and they are actually worried about terrorist attacks because all the presidents of um most of the countries will be there 

349.42 362.26 B: and they actually closing the airports and cutting down on visas and they only issuing diplomatic visas for like officials and presidents and stuff like that i mean 

350.33 351.40 A: wow 

362.80 365.12 B: they are worried more than we do 

365.24 366.47 A: (( oh my )) 

365.88 366.93 B: (( um [sigh] )) 

367.69 379.72 A: you don't think of well uh you know i don't think of a lot of other countries i'm sure they've got a lot of problems with that sort of thing but just hearing you say that they've got problems with terrorism i wouldn't think that russia would 

379.84 383.21 A: you know it just doesn't seem like it's as big of a target 

381.14 382.56 B: yeah 

383.32 392.16 B: yeah but uh you see a lot of country leaders are going to be gathered in one place so it would be a very convenient location um 

389.30 390.39 A: right 

391.00 392.06 A: yeah 

392.86 393.66 B: um 

394.09 395.50 A: yeah 

394.16 403.05 B: i i don't know my mom actually is coming here during that celebration and she is a little bit worried about flying here 

403.16 405.36 B: um hope she's gonna be okay 

405.45 406.67 A: yeah 

405.45 407.69 B: but she's kind of nervous uh 

407.12 409.43 A: she's gonna fly to the celebration 

409.19 413.51 B: uh she's going to fly off here 

413.61 418.62 B: she's no- not going to be um in st petersburg during the celebration 

413.67 414.60 A: oh 

418.25 419.46 A: oh okay 

419.34 422.23 B: (( because i don't know [mn] yeah [noise] )) 

422.94 437.11 A: i wouldn't wanna you know you you just kinda put yourself in harm's way sometimes and you kind of pick and choose what you wanna risk your your life on or whatever you know i mean any any celebration big celebration you could have problems with riots or 

437.03 446.14 A: or just the like that washington sniper i mean just someone wanting to just get a thrill out of or whatever whatever their reasons are but 

444.31 446.44 B: right right 

446.74 447.95 A: geez 

447.93 451.28 B: i try not to think about those issues normally but n- 

451.50 452.45 A: yeah 

452.45 455.55 A: yeah and i think a lot of people 

455.54 468.34 A: uh don't think about stuff like september eleventh everyone thought that everybody would change their lives and become better people or whatever everyone was saying and it just seems like uh everybody kinda went back to the way they were you know 

468.10 470.04 B: (( yeah )) 

470.36 471.76 B: (( i guess [mn] )) 

471.99 482.61 A: i would like to see more patriotism like in our schools to get the pledge of allegiance back in there and i don't know it just seems like people have gone way overboard with things and 

482.75 489.22 A: it just kind of uh it's kinda ridiculous after a point and it it's just kind of sad that people think they're 

489.25 492.62 A: they have some sort of cause and everything if they're not 

493.08 495.39 A: uh they just they just uh 

495.47 499.77 A: pick up a cause and run with it almost even though they don't really think about it 

499.79 504.39 A: and they get uh w- way too far overboard with everything i don't know 

503.94 506.50 B: yeah sometimes that happens [laughter] 

505.81 506.87 A: yeah 

507.66 508.52 A: but 

509.11 510.43 A: so i don't know 

510.58 520.95 A: in the whole uh terrorist uh uh what where it's severe and high high alert is i think we're back to high alert now aren't we 

520.67 521.89 B: yeah 

521.24 527.14 A: yeah so that's good because i think we were at severe wasn't that the next level orange or something 

527.43 529.85 B: um i'm not sure [laughter] 

528.21 535.59 A: but [lipsmack] but i wonder how they judge that you know how they how they determine what our threat is at and stuff 

536.12 537.55 B: yeah 

537.02 541.76 A: but do you think saddam had anything to do with the ni- september eleventh attack 

541.42 544.09 B: well it's hard to say i mean um 

544.28 545.04 B: (( mm )) 

545.17 546.53 B: he might be 

546.55 548.54 B: we'll never know for sure i mean 

548.08 549.20 A: i know 

548.64 552.35 B: or what we see on the news might be not the real picture 

552.37 555.62 B: because i was talking to my relatives and they would um 

555.92 562.14 B: uh they told me that uh things they saw on t._v. was a little bit different from what was shown here 

562.18 563.26 B: and i guess 

563.37 568.31 B: i don't know there might be some censorship on the government's part [sigh] 

566.35 567.30 A: yeah 

568.61 582.75 A: yeah i wonder what the media is allowed to show and stuff and everyone thinks that the media knows everything and i i'm sure there must be a lot that's filtered out before it gets to their access you know 

583.25 584.64 B: yeah 

585.82 586.82 A: (( [noise] but )) 

586.12 586.78 B: (( [mn] )) 

587.12 589.19 A: [laughter] 

587.48 599.89 B: i mean that was fun i mean i'm not usually used to talking on the phone 'cause i'm only in this country for like a couple of years and i don't have that mu- many friends to talk with um 

595.20 596.27 A: yeah
