13.99 15.38 A: same here 

14.80 22.40 B: this is my first call um with fisher and i understand our topic is what changes we have made since nine one one 

22.71 25.79 B: um would you like to start or shall i 

25.82 27.41 A: uh you can [noise] [noise] 

26.85 28.34 B: okay um 

28.39 37.17 B: to be honest with you i don't think we've made any changes as far as travel or types of security things like that 

37.28 48.13 B: other than perhaps being more close with our friends and family because i think the incident on nine one one really brought about how 

48.27 57.05 B: how fleeting um our lives can be and how it can change in in such a rapid manner but other than that i don't think we've really 

57.09 65.39 B: gone through any significant changes maybe opening up our hearts to other and and donating more to charities i know that's for sure 

64.40 68.44 A: [noise] exactly i feel the same way i don't think 

68.63 75.28 A: think at the beginning a lot of people changed a lot of things and now it seems to be back to the same old way 

75.15 76.16 B: yeah 

75.39 84.60 A: it's like it's you know it was that time and now that time has passed and you're going on with your lives me myself 

84.89 87.06 A: i'm sorry no 

87.64 89.90 B: you must have a little one nearby huh 

89.34 98.32 A: uh yeah and he's cutting his hair [laughter] [noise] but we haven't changed our way of living since then 

91.18 93.90 B: oh no oh no that's not good 

98.45 103.10 A: um we just go one day at time [noise] 

101.69 107.67 B: i know my husband was concerned about traveling as he does a lot of business uh travel 

105.72 106.63 A: travel 

107.60 108.95 A: [noise] 

107.78 118.43 B: but um after his first flight when he saw all the um personnel and and security measures that were in place he he felt more comfortable about it 

110.28 113.00 A: (( [noise] )) 

114.98 120.03 A: (( [noise] )) 

118.49 125.40 B: uh i know he was on one flight where there was a gentleman of middle eastern descent who 

125.42 130.73 B: uh all of a sudden stood up and claimed that he was going to take over the um the plane 

130.88 132.15 A: oh wow 

131.07 137.47 B: and everybody just stopped and looked and then the guy sat down again and said oh he was just kidding 

137.25 139.98 A: [laughter] 

138.59 147.62 B: and everybody was just absolutely stunned and as soon as the plane landed he was hustled off the plane and arrested 

147.58 155.47 B: because that's something you just don't do on a plane i don't care who you are we think maybe he might have been mentally disturbed or something but um 

150.83 153.80 A: oh really he got arrested 

155.64 168.31 B: but my husband was real calm about it and said that it just reinforced his feeling that the airlines are doing what they can to prevent uh something like that from happening again [sigh] i 

167.27 172.73 A: right i think they've taken precaution as far as the airlines goes 

171.46 177.00 B: oh absolutely and it's it's they need to because it's one area that um 

177.51 184.27 B: that definitely needed some beefing up [sigh] uh simply because there was it was lax you know before this happened 

183.72 187.90 A: what do you think about uh people coming over in boats 

188.75 190.39 A: or ships 

188.79 189.75 B: um 

189.92 192.11 B: from from other countries 

192.00 199.92 A: yes i i haven't heard much about uh safety security on boats and ships 

199.77 204.00 B: i i haven't either other than the fact that supposedly 

202.44 207.61 A: 'cause they can come on that too and that's what i was wondering i'm like well what about [laughter] 

206.89 213.86 B: yeah i i would think that um immigration has been tightened up and and they're checking um 

214.85 225.95 B: identification more carefully you know and trying to screen you know a little bit better about who's being allowed into our country and who's not but it is an enormous task 

226.01 227.21 B: um 

227.43 237.71 B: i don't i guess i haven't really given that much thought simply because [laughter] i don't travel by boat you know so i haven't really thought of how that changes uh 

237.83 240.85 B: what those kind of changes would affect me personally 

240.81 242.83 A: have you guys had any uh 

243.13 246.25 A: well back when nine eleven was happening 

246.49 251.67 A: did you have any ow let go any riots going on [noise] 

250.40 252.39 B: no no in fact 

252.59 264.31 B: we were out of town when that happened uh my mother in law had had a heart attack and was in the hospital and we were we found out she needed um uh 

253.74 257.05 A: [noise] 

257.91 261.76 A: (( [noise] )) 

265.05 267.72 B: what'd you call it nursing skilled nursing home care 

268.02 273.08 B: and we were staying at a hotel and got up that morning to see 

272.70 273.61 A: [noise] 

273.13 275.83 B: the tragedy that was unfolding on t._v. 

274.64 275.34 A: [noise] 

275.78 277.35 A: oh wow 

276.52 285.39 B: and just we we were just stunned and and didn't know what was really going on a whole lot other than what we saw on the television 

284.37 288.78 A: (( [noise] )) 

285.59 293.54 B: and still had to accomplish what we were down there for dealing with her the doctors and the hospital and the social workers and the nurses and 

293.26 294.59 A: wow 

293.57 303.66 B: oh it it was a mess and the first thing that i noticed that was really odd was all these cars were lining up at gas stations everywhere across the city 

303.82 316.04 B: and i was going what is going on i thought everybody was going to be fleeing the city [laughter] maybe we were under atomic attack or something and it turned out everyone was um filling up on gas because of the rumor 

313.62 314.75 A: (( [noise] on )) 

315.96 317.75 A: the gas prices 

316.08 321.12 B: that gas was gonna yeah and that they were gonna gas lines were gonna be shut off

320.95 323.48 A: how high did yours guys get 

323.00 327.53 B: um at some stations it actually went up to almost five dollars a gallon 

327.71 332.35 A: see there were a couple here that got in big trouble for doing that [noise] 

327.74 329.23 B: which is high for 

331.20 341.01 B: yeah they ours did too the few stations that did that because it was definitely illegal but my husband said you know nuts with that that's that's just uh 

333.50 336.70 A: big trouble [noise] 

341.04 351.16 B: screwy so we just watched all these people you know in line for hours to get a [laughter] tank of gas while we just went about our business so i mean that didn't even affect us 

350.90 363.61 A: exactly it didn't affect us either now i've got a ten year old in school and there was times that the school took a lot of precaution i mean they watched every step every visitor that came in 

353.14 354.61 B: yeah we figured 

363.14 364.53 B: oh definitely 

363.74 375.92 A: now it's kinda laid back but there's still security they've got new doors at the front and and i don't live in a really uh meanful active 

376.04 381.58 A: city you know it's just kind of a laid back city and uh 

379.92 385.08 B: yeah that's what we are too we're out here in buffalo which is a more rural community 

385.01 396.65 B: and uh although we've got a fairly large high school but they've um instituted programs you know like that one and have the local sheriff's department that has has worked with the uh school 

390.42 392.81 A: (( [noise] )) 

394.72 398.10 A: (( [noise] )) 

396.66 401.50 B: to make sure that um all the all the doors are locked now except for the main entrance 

401.58 404.09 B: and visitors have to register 

404.11 409.25 B: they're they're no longer just allowed to walk in and you know walk to child's classroom like they used to 

409.49 412.59 B: so i mean i i think those changes are good 

409.81 410.59 A: (( well )) 

412.13 426.36 A: right exactly and and i feel it's good for all over especially when you're a single parent and the other partner isn't allowed to take the kids 'cause you hear a bunch about that but since september eleven they finally did something about it [noise] 

420.27 421.36 B: oh yeah 

425.39 427.88 B: sure i do know that they 

426.76 428.53 A: i know i'm sorry

448.94 458.57 A: the same time he was announcing our regrand opening was the same time we got the information that the airplane hit [laughter] so it was a kinda 

455.24 456.59 B: (( oh my god )) 

458.42 466.55 A: good day but then we couldn't continue with our ceremony because we needed to stop and listen to this [noise] we needed to respect 

464.50 465.36 B: well 

466.81 472.69 A: everybody else so we never did have our re-grand opening [laughter] 

470.11 471.30 B: oh 

471.59 476.74 B: that's is that's a shame but i can understand how you know this would take precedence because that was just so 

476.41 477.87 A: oh yeah 

477.28 482.69 B: it was just so horrifying you know to see it and it was just hard to comprehend
