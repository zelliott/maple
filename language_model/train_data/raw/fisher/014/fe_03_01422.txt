64.58 66.07 A: put in one place 

66.23 67.11 B: uh-huh

79.32 83.87 B: um that's interesting i yeah well i guess i'm uh 

84.29 90.79 B: i'm i'm used to things like this so these things don't bother me much and so i i really haven't done anything uh 

91.01 97.97 B: different uh with my life in fact uh i find travel a lot easier than it used to be 

98.35 103.12 B: uh you know they said that security was going to be much tighter or something like that but 

103.48 116.90 B: um it's very professional they do a good job but airports and so on but uh i i haven't fou- in fact there are fewer flying [laughter] so for me it's been a lot easier than um than than before 

116.92 118.93 B: uh do you do you fly much 

118.87 119.87 A: no 

119.70 121.40 B: no you don't do it 

120.07 122.46 A: not much only when we go on vacation 

122.00 125.06 B: uh okay see i fly for business so 

125.42 132.70 B: uh that uh so i can't i can't al- i don't really allow it to uh to stop me in any particular way 

132.80 140.77 B: uh but you you've you're you're uh you think it's really uh it it clearly has affected you then in the way 

139.80 144.36 A: yeah we uh it's just we don't like it 

144.21 158.45 A: we don't allow it to stop our lives or anything but we just wanna be prepared you know when it first happened they with all the news reports and everything they recommended having seven days of uh 

146.62 147.59 B: okay 

158.38 161.12 A: dry goods food and water 

160.95 162.21 B: right 

161.18 172.71 A: uh to allow at least seven days that way if there was if a terror- if there was a terrorist attack in your area you would have enough food and water to survive on until the rescuers could get to you 

172.49 173.57 B: (( mm )) 

173.13 185.94 A: and so we uh immediately stocked up with the water and everything and we've just kept it all there in the meantime especially since the uh the war that's going on right now 

185.33 186.23 B: uh-huh 

185.91 190.80 A: in case there's any kind of retaliation attack it's kinda like the threats are 

190.84 192.28 A: been renewed 

191.91 192.85 B: (( mm )) 

192.69 194.22 A: and so yeah 

193.99 199.76 B: now do you uh do you live in in a city or in a town or what what what uh 

199.05 212.61 A: well we live in a suburb we live um outside of dallas but the problem is we live far enough away from d._s._w. but um right in our area there's the arlington municipal 

204.27 205.28 B: yeah 

212.70 224.01 A: airport which is a little airport and then there's the grand prix airport a little airport and i figure the big airports have got all the the good security but those little airports 

213.44 214.90 B: (( ah )) 

224.08 225.31 B: oh 

224.09 227.64 A: are is where they're likely to slip up 

226.85 232.25 B: right right yeah i can i can imagine yeah i you know that's probably true 

232.58 234.36 A: but my husband works 

232.65 233.45 B: (( uh-huh )) 

234.57 240.18 A: uh he's a flooring contractor and he works in downtown dallas virtually everyday 

240.09 241.57 B: (( oh so you just )) 

240.66 243.14 A: and so there's um 

244.60 257.10 A: there's a lot of anxiety ther- i mean i'm not that scared for myself 'cause i work from home but with him being in those buildings if anything's going to get targeted in dallas it's gonna be downtown 

248.94 249.90 B: (( mm )) 

256.72 258.49 B: that's true yeah 

257.89 259.82 A: and uh so 

259.37 260.17 B: (( mm )) 

260.21 262.14 B: so he works in the high building 

261.82 267.07 A: yeah but he doesn't take any kind of precautions he goes about business as usual 

264.56 265.54 B: well 

266.81 275.67 B: well he can't i mean what can what can he do i mean uh except change his business and go and work somewhere else i mean what what what else could could he do 

273.02 273.83 A: [laughter] 

275.40 277.99 A: and with the job market the way it is 

277.23 278.79 B: no kidding 

278.04 280.57 A: there's that's kind of not an option 

280.17 281.55 B: yeah 

281.30 282.39 A: yeah 

281.76 284.67 B: i i bet i mean i mean it's uh 

284.73 290.31 B: to me i mean when was the last uh you know terrorist attack that's happened in the u._s. 

290.71 292.32 A: the well the 

292.17 294.66 B: (( it was uh yeah )) 

292.50 293.93 A: before that one 

294.17 298.51 A: wasn't it the same the world trade center but in the basement 

298.26 301.00 B: [mn] yeah right it was like ten years before 

301.05 310.80 A: no actually be- uh the most recent was um was the oklahoma bombing but that was that was a u._s. that was an american that did that 

305.98 307.04 B: oh right 

310.18 311.50 B: that's true 

311.50 318.08 A: but before that there was the other attack on the world trade center in the basement and they only succeeded in 

316.15 317.46 B: yeah 

318.21 320.41 A: basically caving in the basement 

319.92 321.86 B: and that was ten years before 

321.51 322.75 A: yeah 

322.13 331.18 B: so basically once every five years once every five or ten year is what we're seeing but maybe there what they are afraid of is that because of the 

331.40 341.08 B: hostilities now in the middle east people even have more more of a reason to uh to perform some of these acts and that's probably why they're worried 

340.48 341.96 A: exactly 

342.07 351.98 A: it's what i'm afraid of um i've i've believed for a long time that uh a lot of the funding for terrorism came from saddam 

343.55 344.56 B: (( mm )) 

351.78 353.15 B: mhm 

352.50 356.59 A: and so that's what i'm afraid of if we cut off their money supply 

356.22 361.50 B: oh really that's interesting because all the reports say he had nothing to do with it 

356.89 358.27 A: you know 

360.66 364.74 A: well not that he had anything directly to do with it he just gives 'em money 

362.99 365.47 B: yeah do you think so huh 

365.20 370.52 A: uh-huh that that originally that's what they said when september eleventh happened 

365.76 366.94 B: wow 

367.90 377.04 B: because see they were they were really they they opposed him a lot they opposed each other that's what's interesting i think they're giving a whole bunch of uh 

374.04 375.04 A: really 

377.14 379.44 B: uh things to scare us mostly 

379.77 380.65 A: well 

380.36 382.03 B: it's uh 

380.92 382.95 A: better safe than sorry though 

382.54 386.72 B: well no yeah yeah i cannot you know once uh 

386.77 393.37 A: but they do feel like they that's the reason they did it in the first place is they said we needed to keep our noses in our own business 

393.20 395.13 B: yeah 

393.77 396.09 A: and then we go over there and start a war 

395.79 399.43 B: [laughter] so there's even more of a reason now 

397.08 398.86 A: so yeah 

399.61 400.62 A: right 

400.22 402.91 B: (( yeah how you gonna )) 

402.43 407.89 A: and my husband went to the army he's the one who purchased the gas masks insisted on the gas masks 

408.24 415.38 A: because we have a three year old son and uh so he insisted on getting those and got 'em from the army navy store 

410.58 412.56 B: yeah 

415.58 418.33 A: and they're all on hooks on the garage wall 

418.06 424.10 B: well if it makes you feel better that's good i think yeah that's the important thing is that you feel 

420.92 422.23 A: yeah 

424.26 427.03 B: you feel you're that you're doing all you can 

427.12 435.47 B: so you know for your for your family uh see i'm i have a different background and so i i've been in war zones 

427.34 428.42 A: right 

435.44 448.96 B: and uh and so a little a little scare like this doesn't scare me anymore i've had i've had bombs fall fall all all around me and so uh once once you face 

440.92 442.29 A: right 

448.89 455.02 B: uh a situation like that where you know you can be killed at any poi- at any moment 

455.51 463.56 B: uh a single a single terrorist act is not going to uh to do it because it's obviously very localized when it happens 

463.67 469.09 B: it can happen anywhere in the world i mean you never know right and so 

466.77 468.61 A: right 

469.56 472.37 B: so even even when bombs are falling 

472.84 473.50 A: (( [noise] )) 

472.99 474.65 B: (( you know i um )) 

474.83 476.35 B: (( i remember )) 

477.58 481.44 B: thinking my gosh what am i doing here i can be killed 

481.71 485.48 B: you know as long as a bomb didn't fall right on me i was okay 

485.33 486.92 A: right [laughter] 

485.80 491.32 B: [laughter] it's like it's like being in a war i mean you know if you don't get killed it's not so bad 

491.44 501.93 B: uh but if you get killed of course that's it that's uh but the thing that there's not much you can do about it um now because in my case i 

501.95 504.04 B: i didn't know there was going to be 

504.18 513.01 B: bombing when i was there and and so uh i you know i took a little risk of course uh 

513.60 522.03 B: uh so the the thing to do for me would be not to have gone in the first place even though i thought it was quiet when i went but now 

520.34 521.36 A: right 

522.14 527.13 B: with the if a if a terrorism can act any place at any time 

527.60 537.10 B: uh then there is no way you can really avoid it yeah the only question is uh 

533.20 534.74 A: right 

537.44 538.52 B: (( you know )) 

539.56 543.23 B: can i think the the extent i mean 

544.08 546.14 B: like in new york what happened 

546.44 549.01 B: um in september eleven 

549.31 558.96 B: uh could these have people i mean what what would have stocking up done for the people there probably nothing 

559.01 563.38 B: um this is this stocking up is in case of a major 

563.87 572.16 B: thing like uh nuclear or something or some attack which nobody right now has the power to do yet 

571.92 578.56 A: right well then uh actually i'm more scared of the biological warfare 

578.78 584.17 A: that's what really i'm not i don't where i'm at i don't see bombs dropping 

582.71 584.88 B: (( [noise] )) 

584.46 586.81 A: i'm not close enough to the city 

586.66 590.86 B: mm so you think a biological yeah things i see 

586.87 588.96 A: for that but 

590.00 592.93 A: yeah but if they let anything loose 

593.14 596.04 A: you know and it starts to spread 

596.95 598.14 A: (( you know )) 

597.69 599.89 B: well then everybody is in trouble
