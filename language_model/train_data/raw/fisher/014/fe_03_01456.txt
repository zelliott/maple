123.84 128.02 A: one of the things that happened with her was that she had just bought a new home 

128.38 130.98 A: and so when she went um 

131.27 145.69 A: [cough] when she heard a plane coming over she says you know she says every time i heard a plane i felt that it wa going to crash into my house [laughter] so as well you'll get over that you know but that was her first thinking you know because 

138.50 139.35 B: right 

140.40 141.22 B: (( right )) 

142.28 143.26 B: right 

145.65 146.49 A: (( um )) 

146.65 151.77 A: uh the her house was the main thing in her life right at that moment [laughter] and so 

151.78 156.90 A: she didn't know if there was going to be a terror attack in phoenix or not but 

154.94 156.00 B: right 

156.20 164.85 B: right yeah i think yeah i mean those images that were aired over and over and over again on t._v. after september eleventh 

162.68 163.59 A: mhm 

164.90 177.82 B: i think like are now like etched into everyone's mind i know i was visiting a friend from high school of mine who who now goes to college in chicago and they were just sort of sitting around downtown chicago talking and when you look up at those big buildings 

177.51 178.76 A: mhm 

177.90 185.68 B: you al- almost like instinctively after september eleventh you have you can you can see like a plane hitting them it's really 

185.48 187.17 A: oh yeah 

185.51 195.95 B: kind of really like not that not that i actually think that that would happen but you can 'cause it's just those images are so like etched into everyone's mind because we all saw them so much i think 

195.47 204.88 A: i think maybe the media really played a a little bit on on that and everything it was like okay um 

205.27 215.99 A: there's ten people watching but then there might be ten people that haven't seen it at all and that's [laughter] they kept playing it over and over again but um you know i think that once you saw it you 

210.18 211.18 B: right 

211.77 212.58 B: right 

212.80 213.65 B: right 

215.85 230.31 A: i didn't really need to see it again because i could visualize you know things you know and how it happened and and 'cause it was very very tragic and and so i felt really sorry for the families and the the 

229.37 230.16 B: yeah 

230.51 231.46 A: um 

231.60 234.55 A: uh the people that um 

234.68 235.64 A: were 

236.04 236.85 B: (( right the )) 

236.72 237.76 A: (( right )) 

237.80 239.04 B: (( firemen that helped you )) 

238.37 240.13 A: these people and i felt 

240.16 241.34 A: (( really )) 

241.64 243.58 A: felt for them yeah 

243.44 244.11 B: (( know mm )) 

244.34 255.88 A: the thing is that um one of the thing one of the thoughts that ran through my mind though was here's these two buildings and to me they were just buildings in a financial center 

255.81 256.76 B: right 

256.11 263.35 A: uh but i thought gee they must really mean something to the people in the east or whatever 

262.11 263.97 B: yeah yeah 

263.36 264.68 A: an- and 

265.03 276.13 A: that they think that that building represents that all that whole building represents what the american people were like and you would destroy the american people if you ran into those buildings 

272.26 272.95 B: (( mm )) 

275.54 276.87 B: right 

276.31 279.27 A: you know and then of course i didn't think that 

279.28 285.66 A: you know was surprised that they had uh you know did the pentagon or something like that but 

285.47 286.39 B: right 

285.76 286.76 A: i 

286.88 297.32 A: had to think about what are those people really feeling like you know i i tried to think that um and tried to put my 

297.35 303.09 A: feet in those other people's shoes just just for a moment to say why 

300.04 301.18 B: right 

303.23 312.84 A: would they do that you know [laughter] what really makes them think that they you know will destroy the american people or their spirit or whatever 

304.99 305.67 B: (( yes )) 

310.48 311.20 B: (( right )) 

312.98 320.22 A: because those financial buildings i mean how many other countries were involved in that they said over a hundred 

319.94 321.56 B: yeah yeah 

320.78 332.14 A: uh a hundred so i learned from my last talk with someone said that there was a hundred three countries that were really involved there wasn't just the american people there 

326.86 327.68 B: uh-huh 

328.79 329.81 B: yeah 

330.70 331.62 B: right 

332.28 336.58 B: right and one of the yeah one of the things i remember thinking is 'cause 'cause 

336.69 351.22 B: of the basis for that it's just the the strong hatred of like america americanism and american people and almost just wanting to like they want to just like destroy as many as they can and i remember one of the things i'm thinking is um like 

351.26 359.74 B: here at college like uh i'm at i'm at the university of wisconsin which is like a very big university and when we go to um 

355.08 355.96 A: mhm 

357.13 358.23 A: mhm 

359.99 374.72 B: like i just remember right after september eleventh going to college football games and security was way step way you know it's very stepped up but just thinking about if they really it's it's just it was such a scary thought because especially really 

367.27 368.40 A: mhm 

374.51 382.19 B: we're just so you know hated americans so much that they just wanted to kill as many as possible uh there's no 

380.12 380.74 A: (( mm )) 

382.51 394.83 B: there's no like area where there's more people in a small area than at a college football game i mean that when that stadium fills up you've got eighty thousand people sitting in there so there was i def- i def- i remember the first they cancelled the 

387.33 387.92 A: (( mm )) 

394.63 403.40 B: our game right after september eleventh and then i remem- yeah and then i remember the next one after that security was very stepped up but i know everyone was 

396.68 397.85 A: oh they did 

403.42 409.83 B: you know a little bit anxious going through it but you know you go on with your daily life and things got back to normal 

410.04 417.14 A: yeah that's that's true uh we we have a very resil- resilient [laughter] culture 

412.16 413.28 B: yeah 

416.44 417.81 B: yeah yeah 

417.16 425.15 A: yes however however i say that anyway that we can bounce back and that's the thing and uh but m- um 

421.47 423.25 B: right yeah 

425.34 438.02 A: my travel plans have not changed and things like that that people say well it was affected this this this and this and really i've gone on with my life and my plans and what i should 

427.82 428.83 B: right 

431.89 432.67 B: right 

435.93 436.81 B: right 

438.08 444.52 A: you know do i might think about a little bit okay now what if i was cut off with my water and my 

438.48 439.27 B: yep 

444.45 445.32 B: yeah 

444.92 446.53 A: food so 

446.59 450.04 A: i kinda planned a little bit about that 

449.86 450.75 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

450.11 456.51 A: i don't think that the terrorist is biological things like i haven't done anything 

456.52 465.98 A: you know or thought anything about well if i go i go you know but um it you know a a daily thing like food and water i 

459.87 460.76 B: right 

466.09 474.98 A: kind of i i kind of stepped up that a little bit and said okay i better fill these jugs full of water you know [laughter] things like that but that 

469.53 470.52 B: right 

472.18 473.28 B: yeah 

474.01 474.90 B: yeah i 

474.97 479.74 B: yeah i think there's a lot of indirect effects just like like 

480.16 487.91 B: sorry just a sec amy can you get oh sorry my my i'm on a cellphone and my home phone is ringing but i'm just ignore it um 

485.52 486.37 A: oh 

488.21 497.00 B: it's just checked it i am actually turning twenty one in about seven hours so there's everyone's running around we're going out for dinner in about fifteen minutes [laughter] 

492.49 493.43 A: (( mm )) 

495.95 498.99 A: oh well congratulations then 

498.23 500.03 B: well thank you [laughter] 

499.10 508.28 A: have a very nice time and and um a birthday party and everything that's kind of [laughter] [laughter] okay 

501.82 502.73 B: [laughter] 

504.02 505.11 B: [laughter] 

505.26 510.64 B: yeah yeah um yeah yeah i'm trying yeah i i think there's a lot of 

510.97 519.61 B: i mean if you more think of it in terms of what september eleventh has affected in terms of other things it's just affected so you know 

519.65 525.92 B: so many other things going on today indirectly like not direct results of it but i mean even things like 

526.00 532.27 B: obviously the war with iraq and that is obviously affecting a lot of people's lives um 

528.70 529.76 A: mhm 

532.53 539.20 B: and that's certainly a um you know tied in to september eleventh i think um 

537.34 538.34 A: mhm 

539.24 540.34 B: (( but )) 

539.65 543.73 A: i think that has affected me more than september eleventh in a way because 

543.71 556.45 A: i you know i know people that have gone over there i not really personally but um you know like where i work maybe the guy had to go because he was called up in the national guards you know and i felt 

545.63 546.60 B: right 

554.48 555.36 B: right 

555.41 556.29 B: yeah 

556.65 564.83 A: really kind of sad about that and um uh this type of thing but uh and as far as uh 

558.64 559.50 B: right 

564.88 568.68 B: and it's also more of a september eleventh was more of 

564.92 565.79 A: you know 

568.86 571.98 B: more of a help a feeling of helplessness like 

571.38 572.63 A: mhm 

572.02 577.78 B: you know all these people just died this horrible thing happened how can we you know deal with it whereas 

577.95 584.23 B: you know iraq the iraq you know it's it's a preventative thing that it's more of an off- off- offensive thing when we're 

584.46 586.21 B: doing something for a reason 

585.27 586.09 A: mhm 

586.18 599.95 B: and you know it's not definitely not as clear cut i mean certainly around here the result there's there were protests all the time and you know i'm i'm definitely split on it but i think it it's very different feelings and reactions associated to the two because one was just 

589.69 590.70 A: yeah
