5.34 7.44 B: hi alma where are you at 

6.82 8.81 A: middletown new jersey 

8.63 12.66 B: okay so you were closer to the attacks than i was i'm in michigan 

11.30 12.21 A: where 

12.57 14.67 A: oh okay whereabouts in michigan 

14.67 18.75 B: in hillsdale michigan which is right down by the ohio border 

18.46 19.89 A: oh okay 

20.06 23.83 B: so how closer are you to to new york city 

24.21 32.26 A: ah too close we are we are right across the bay a large portion of people from middletown commute into the city for work yeah 

31.99 32.93 B: oh 

32.44 39.07 A: and i think we lost more residents per capita than any other town we lost about thirty seven people 

36.65 37.69 B: (( oh no )) 

39.37 40.91 B: (( oh my )) 

40.49 45.97 A: so ah yeah we it was had a great effect on our on our town [laughter] 

45.62 48.46 B: oh yes my biggest 

48.50 57.87 B: response to that or the thing that bothered me the most was that i have never in my life been afraid like i was afraid that day 

50.14 51.39 A: mhm 

57.64 59.25 A: (( mhm )) 

60.49 66.30 A: yeah it was just that we didn't know what was going to happen after that we we were all in in pennsylvania that day 

66.08 67.41 B: oh my god 

66.48 70.85 A: we were out in the woods and didn't know what had happened until we came out and found that the 

70.94 79.28 A: that the state parks the state park office was closed and we couldn't figure out why until we you know got to where we could hear [laughter] hear the news 

78.73 79.88 B: oh 

79.57 90.24 A: and of course when we got home and you look across the bay and there's nothing but smoke where those buildings were and you know where your grandchildren [laughter] have been taken to the roof and everything and ah 

85.37 86.54 B: oh 

90.19 91.25 B: oh 

91.25 94.58 A: and ah yeah it was just it was hard to take it in 

94.86 99.82 B: so i'm this had a far greater impact on you that it did me 

100.44 108.92 B: because you know i you know i was here watching it on t._v. um listening to it on the news and it was like you know to me it was um 

100.48 101.20 A: i 

101.72 102.64 A: yeah 

104.01 105.19 A: mhm 

109.12 116.43 B: unfathomable i could not imagine it it actually happening i could not imagine that you know the twin towers being gone 

114.31 115.25 A: yeah 

116.35 120.54 A: right and that that was exactly our reaction too and then of course 

120.69 133.51 A: for weeks after you know there were the obituaries where the or at least memorial notices in the paper and it just seemed to go on and on and now every little area around here seems to have a memorial or a memorial garden 

123.99 124.85 B: oh 

133.69 137.63 A: so it's it's it's like we can't get away from it [laughter] 

136.97 139.36 B: oh i'm i'm sure that you can't 

138.48 143.07 A: but ah so as far as i guess the question was what changes have we made since then 

142.84 144.16 B: mhm 

143.61 148.74 A: well i'd say i'm even more reluctant to go into the new york city [laughter] than before 

148.94 151.83 B: um it has made me very much um 

151.84 152.69 A: (( and ah )) 

152.31 164.72 B: it's it's made me afraid and i have never ever felt that way in all of my forty five years of being alive i have never felt ah afraid because we've been attacked on our soil before 

156.19 157.26 A: uh-huh 

158.95 160.65 A: yeah 

164.41 165.61 A: right 

165.80 170.17 A: and it's just the the uncertainty of where and when and what and 

170.06 178.65 B: yes yes and i live in an extremely rural area and but even in this area um everyone was 

174.26 175.42 A: mhm 

178.84 187.62 B: especially the day after the the day of the attack everyone was very very somber around here but the day the day after the attack and following that um 

183.21 184.56 A: mhm 

187.97 193.62 B: you've seen the commercial where it definitely changed america with everyone putting out their flags 

193.15 194.57 A: yes uh-huh 

193.94 203.75 B: and it really did and i think that um it's very fair to say that that the terrorist attack actually as a nation brought us together 

203.57 218.09 B: you know everyone everyone had an opinion about it um you could even walk up to total strangers and discuss what had happened because i think it affected every single one of us even though we weren't like right there it still 

217.23 218.10 A: right 

217.92 219.70 B: was was such um a 

219.78 229.12 B: huge impact and everyone was was very very in our area especially and i'm sure in your area was extremely patriotic you know there were flags flying 

225.80 226.81 A: yeah 

228.83 229.96 A: mhm 

228.89 234.91 B: um everyone was putting out flags a newspaper came out with a flag that you could tape to your window if you wanted to 

234.41 235.58 A: right 

235.00 235.98 B: um 

236.51 249.50 B: [mn] but still it was very scary and the thing that bothered me that that really bothers me quite a bit is that um i'm afraid that we will go through we haven't done it yet which is surprising is 

249.62 251.59 B: (( that after world war two )) 

251.92 254.64 B: or during world war two we rounded up 

255.79 260.21 B: and we put them in prison camps can you hang on a second thanks 

258.49 259.40 A: sure 

288.81 289.90 B: alma 

289.37 290.38 A: yes 

290.11 291.90 B: i'm sorry about that 

291.09 292.31 A: that's okay 

292.13 292.96 B: um 

292.47 296.86 A: so you think it's going to have a negative effect on civil liberties in in effect 

295.39 303.02 B: well i'm afraid of that it hasn't happened yet and i'm very surprised because i know that we rounded up all the japanese and threw them in prison camps 

302.92 313.03 B: you know and and detained them and we haven't seen that so much yet but i did notice we have a family from syria that live here in hillsdale 

303.54 304.54 A: yeah 

305.70 306.97 A: mhm 

311.22 312.31 A: mhm 

312.69 313.57 A: yes 

312.91 318.48 B: and um their store really really took a nosedive afterwards 

317.95 319.47 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

318.85 325.86 B: and i've always considered myself to be very open and unbiased and unprejudiced in my opinion 

325.67 326.75 A: mhm 

325.88 335.51 B: and it really bothered me that the community that i live in was so quick to judge thinking that these people were associated with bin laden 

335.34 348.94 B: and with the terrorist attack when it's like whoa whoa whoa these you know the people who actually own it um were born and raised in the united states it was his father that came over from syria due to the catholic and religious persecution 

342.90 343.89 A: right 

348.62 349.98 A: mhm 

349.55 353.82 B: but noone but but not a lot of people know that and 

352.47 365.12 A: no and and certainly it's you know it's happened everywhere it's it's a very it's very hard because the profile of the of not only the september eleven terrorists but the other attacks 

356.56 357.48 B: yes 

365.31 368.33 A: the mogadishu attacks were all 

368.67 371.52 A: you know [laughter] they were all middle eastern males between 

371.73 373.48 A: seventeen and forty 

373.21 374.21 B: yes 

373.66 376.88 A: and and so how do you not profile 

377.82 385.54 A: and and like so i guess i can still see doing that at airports or you know places that apt to be 

379.18 379.91 B: yes 

382.75 383.68 B: yes 

385.87 387.55 A: ah at risk 

387.85 391.01 A: and at the same time you certainly don't wanna harass 

391.52 394.10 A: like you say innocent people 

391.98 393.15 B: the innocent 

393.98 395.15 B: right 

394.43 400.13 A: who have absolutely no connection and they're as horrified as anyone else with with what happened 

399.67 412.50 B: well we also know that in the state of michigan that one of the largest arabic influences and the largest arabic immigrant population is in hamtramck michigan which is about two and a half hours from me 

409.64 410.77 A: mhm 

412.14 413.24 A: mhm 

412.45 416.22 B: and we do know that there were cells over there and there is a little town 

416.21 417.04 B: it's 

417.04 423.32 B: called cold water michigan which is to the west of me and cold water has um 

418.61 419.85 A: mhm 

423.23 432.31 B: right now we do know and everyone knows it that we have federal agents in cold water because of the amount of um 

428.81 429.50 A: yes 

432.58 434.94 B: arabic men that are there 

434.60 439.00 A: yes and i i'm sure that's true anywhere that has a large muslim community 

438.77 441.16 B: yes and it's very scary 

439.07 440.35 A: (( and and )) 

441.19 444.24 A: yeah yeah it is very scary but [laughter] 

445.04 450.89 A: i i think to some extent they they should have spoken out more strongly after this happened 

450.55 455.08 B: i think so too i i felt that we should have been over there the next day honestly and truly 

454.96 461.07 A: and i think the muslim community should have spoken out more after this happened also also 

455.26 456.53 B: my husband 

459.04 460.86 B: yes my 

461.16 465.79 B: my husband is an ex marine and and i was um 

462.83 463.98 A: mhm 

465.83 474.96 B: a marine wife [laughter] and i really i really felt that after the attack i really felt that we should have been over there in iraq the very next day 

467.24 468.44 A: mhm 

468.69 469.25 A: (( [laughter] )) 

474.70 476.11 A: mhm 

475.48 481.09 B: i had a very very strong sense of um why are we dragging our feet 

481.45 494.55 B: and this really bothered me because it was like you know we are one of the strongest richest most powerful nations in the whole world and i i felt that at the time right after the attack that we should have been doing something 

488.14 489.18 A: yeah 

495.35 496.77 B: [mn] right away 

496.89 497.93 A: yeah 

497.23 504.43 B: you know right away because what had happened to all of it the innocent blood that had been shed really really bothered me 

504.15 505.19 A: yes 

506.63 510.90 B: and i had a really hard time with dealing with it and i even told my son 

510.97 511.93 B: um 

512.03 526.39 B: that night when i put him to bed september eleventh i told him i said brandon if we don't wake up in the morning know that i have always always loved you and that you are definitely my heart and he woke up the next morning and he was like mom we're still here 

513.73 514.85 A: mhm 

520.57 521.56 A: (( mhm )) 

525.52 527.61 A: [laughter] 

526.36 532.82 B: you know [laughter] it's like yes thank god we're still here and another thing that really bothered me um 

529.24 530.31 A: yeah 

532.90 545.72 B: was that there's two military bases here in michigan and the skies we have the detroit to chicago airport and i'm like we're like in between so we we definitely see the jets and hear the jets 

535.96 537.05 A: (( mhm )) 

540.91 541.91 A: (( mhm )) 

545.46 546.45 A: yeah 

545.71 548.86 B: and there were there was nothing in the sky that day 

549.00 550.02 A: yes 

549.73 553.08 B: and it was like oh my god the sky is silent 

552.48 554.52 A: mhm 

553.28 555.33 B: and that shocked me 

555.34 556.32 A: yeah 

556.45 565.32 B: and then it was later that evening it was probably about eleven pm that we heard the military um jets go over and i knew they were military 

563.94 564.77 A: mhm 

565.09 565.99 A: yeah 

565.37 570.55 B: and that also sent a a great sense of fear through me 

570.97 575.53 A: yeah we've we've got three military installations here and of course they've been flying you 

575.73 577.86 A: know flights over new york city 

578.17 579.52 B: mhm 

578.90 580.28 A: regularly 

581.21 587.31 A: [sigh] so and also i work for a defence contractor [laughter] so i i work with a lot of ex military [laughter] 

581.58 582.66 B: well i don't 

587.06 588.61 B: oh i'm sure you do 

587.33 588.97 A: men too who 

589.19 594.33 B: and i'm sure they felt the same way it's like let's go there now let's just load 'em up and go now 

593.99 598.23 A: well of course at the time our focus was on afghanistan rather than iraq 

597.98 598.92 B: yes
