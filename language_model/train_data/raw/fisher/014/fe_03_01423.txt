1.55 3.27 B: hi i'm stephanie 

3.61 4.42 A: um 

4.94 14.31 A: we really haven't made ma- any changes in our life since the terrorist attack but [laughter] i think due to the economy i did lose my job so [laughter] 

14.08 15.33 B: oh 

15.27 21.35 A: so that you know the our changes have been due to that not to you know directly to the terrorist attack 

22.11 34.76 B: i think for me i haven't traveled as much as i would want to because of um all the security's kinda skeptical to me and i'm just not sure if it's safe still 

34.94 41.65 A: yeah we're we're mostly car travelers so that you know the air flying issue never really comes up 

43.12 43.70 B: (( mhm )) 

43.31 45.42 A: do you live in a big city 

45.02 47.55 B: i live in san francisco 

46.94 52.13 A: oh [laughter] we live in a little tiny rural area outside of pittsburgh 

51.42 52.70 B: [laughter] oh okay 

52.20 56.00 A: yeah close to where one of the jets went down [laughter] 

54.72 55.87 B: (( yes )) 

55.92 57.95 B: that's kinda scary huh 

57.25 58.78 A: yeah 

58.29 59.79 B: but um 

60.88 62.14 B: i think 

62.69 67.17 B: i don't know i don't think it's very safe out there so- still [laughter] sometimes 

66.90 69.05 A: well i see i i feel 

69.32 78.90 A: you know it's i think it's i'm more likely to be in a car accident that to uh have a terrorist attack you know touch me personally [noise] 

78.09 86.64 B: mhm i think it depends you know like where you live too because i have to cross a bridge every day to go to work and 

85.94 87.98 A: (( oh yeah )) 

87.04 96.98 B: it's just kinda of you know with all the with all that's going on in the world you never know it's it's kinda paranoiding but oh well [laughter] 

95.07 95.94 A: [laughter] 

96.45 107.20 A: yeah i have some friends that live in right in manhattan and they just go about their life that you know they say that yeah we go by the hole on our way to work but you know that 

106.53 107.79 B: yeah 

107.30 112.92 A: i guess it just becomes part of the scenery maybe they get um immune to it 

112.29 117.43 B: yeah you have to move on and you know still enjoy your life mhm 

117.50 125.32 A: yeah but yeah i think that so the major changes that we've made are due you know due to economic conditions 

125.36 126.68 A: and 

127.08 131.67 A: you know our travel is you know in my automobile has stayed the same 

131.83 133.50 B: yeah 

134.14 138.58 B: so so you lost your job because of it or 

137.87 150.14 A: well i think that because um the economy just took a downturn shortly after and you know the board of directors says oh we have keep our dividends up let's see how we can you know cut 

142.42 143.70 B: yeah 

149.88 151.61 B: mhm 

150.78 157.59 A: costs and they just you know started laying people off and then the industry that i worked in was a lot of um 

157.85 161.82 A: new construction was involved and you know 

159.62 161.09 B: (( oh mhm )) 

161.89 172.19 A: housing starts went down at the time i think they've come back up but they just you know once they make the cuts that they think oh we can live this way and make more money [laughter] 

166.81 167.80 B: yeah 

171.02 172.86 B: mhm mhm 

173.32 188.11 B: and i think also with the job situation um a lot of my friends who just finished college you know it's very difficult to find a job in the economy right now or just for the past three years or so you know 

185.17 186.48 A: yeah but 

188.07 190.43 B: it's just been really bad and hard 

190.65 194.03 B: trying to find a new job or a job at all [laughter] mhm 

193.36 200.34 A: yeah it uh that's what everybody says you know because i go to the um unemployment office and it's like well you know the 

200.55 207.46 A: uh labor's been down you know all kinds of industries are suffering and probably they'll never you know really 

207.64 211.52 A: jump back up for you know a couple more years 

213.79 216.04 A: we have to keep talking for ten minutes 

215.47 217.19 B: (( so i know [laughter] ))

228.59 231.75 B: do they do they um record us 

231.05 239.80 A: i don't know what the purpose of th- it is because it's supposed to be the linguistics study so maybe they're checking to see how accents 

233.97 235.22 B: oh okay 

239.62 240.69 B: mhm 

239.99 245.94 A: or something you know 'cause 'cause here i am all the way near pittsburgh and you're out there so maybe they're 

245.00 246.75 B: yeah 

247.88 248.64 A: hm 

248.39 249.96 B: hm i've never done this

266.45 267.18 B: (( um )) 

274.89 276.46 B: (( let me think mhm )) 

276.43 287.68 A: so do you think that there'll be more terrorism because of like now that the government our government's mad at syria too you're already you know hear of things going on in the rock and now they're 

287.90 291.59 A: telling syria to behave themselves do you think that will cause more 

292.19 298.98 B: i think there is always the potential these days and you never know if it's going to happen or not 

299.79 307.09 B: i even thought like you know 'cause of during the war times like something could happen you know 

307.40 312.70 B: but i think they're very smart if they were to you know plan something 

312.76 315.05 B: it would be out of the blue you know 

314.44 315.98 A: yeah 

315.63 321.94 B: but i can't you know we don't wanna live on like that just got to move on with life and 

322.21 325.46 B: yeah you know you know i don't want to live in fear and stuff like that 

324.64 335.48 A: yeah that's how i think that you know that i don't get in my car everyday and think oh i hope i don't have an accident so i can't you know go about days thinking oh i hope that you know 

330.44 332.33 B: yeah yeah 

335.60 336.59 A: they don't 

336.61 340.47 A: drive a car bomb into the kmart while i'm shopping or 

339.86 341.17 B: yeah 

340.57 344.80 A: so you know and it just i guess i just don't think about it

345.59 346.15 A: (( [noise] )) 

346.22 352.73 A: and it's mm that's kinda sad to think jeeze something so horrendous happened and here we already are 

352.75 355.72 A: you know but i guess that's human nature to 

354.99 360.74 B: yeah you don't wanna dwel- [mn] dwell on it if it's just gonna 

358.14 359.03 A: yeah 

360.87 363.05 B: it's not going to make you happy or so

380.90 382.51 A: (( at a time mm )) 

382.23 383.13 B: [laughter] 

383.47 388.50 B: so where you're from it's not i mean it's just a little suburb 

388.07 395.97 A: it's more rural there's actually like two miles away there's dairy farms that have cows and things like that so it's really rural 

392.38 394.54 B: oh wow oh wow
