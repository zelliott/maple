162.41 163.46 A: yeah 

163.43 167.57 B: i [mn] i have a feeling they saved her just because she was female and blonde 

168.26 169.89 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

168.76 173.46 B: because the culture just seems to really like blond americans 

173.17 176.18 A: yeah that and i kind of figured maybe 

176.32 180.09 A: they figured they would get a little more information out of her since she was female 

180.55 184.47 B: possibly i haven't heard that tact but i suppose that's possible 

185.12 185.99 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

189.47 190.40 A: (( oh i ))

210.50 213.69 A: naval bases and stuff terrorists and stuff down there 

213.26 219.79 B: yeah i'm i'm very close to camp pembleton just about thirty minutes away and i actually feel a little bit safer 

213.84 215.17 A: maybe doing stuff 

219.51 220.48 A: oh really 

220.16 223.06 B: yeah i like knowing [noise] that they're close by [noise] [noise] [mn] 

222.57 226.27 A: yeah i'd be afraid they'd try to do something too 

226.56 228.15 A: you know try and attack yeah 

228.28 232.88 B: well they could but they're on such a a look out they i don't think they'd ever get close

253.28 261.72 B: i don't think it's almost over but it sure seemed different to me for some reason [noise] [noise] maybe because we had so many more reporters over there and stuff [noise] [noise] 

261.94 263.29 A: yeah yep well 

262.37 266.16 B: [noise] i want you to hold for two seconds i have to cover up a parrot 

265.59 266.83 A: [laughter]

295.09 299.02 B: my son in law was in new york he was working right at the trade centre 

298.57 304.98 A: well now whenever that happened and my grandma actually called me and said did you see what's going on t._v. and i said no 

304.81 309.22 A: i turned it there and i really scared i really wanted to go and pick my kids up at school but i fought it 

309.01 320.35 A: because they hadn't told them there was actually supposed to be a big um thing with the governor and stuff coming to my daughter's school and they cancelled it and they didn't tell the kids what what had happened or anything so mhm yes um [mn] and for some screwy reason 

311.19 311.87 B: (( ahah ah )) 

319.75 332.69 B: well we sure knew we that that was scary it took he just happened to have a friend who grabbed him because he was pretty shell shocked and his friend dragged him down to the ferry boat and got him back to new jersey he got the first and only boat 

332.75 338.11 B: out of the whole area because that was a long scary three or four hours 

335.00 335.64 A: (( the only )) 

337.36 339.17 A: (( person that could get in or out was me )) 

342.79 343.64 A: oh

349.25 353.37 A: yeah do you um think that president bush handled it 

353.64 355.01 A: properly or 

354.97 356.56 B: you know i i know 

356.63 358.20 B: absolutely nothing 

359.02 363.98 B: but i do [mn] i would vote for him again tomorrow even though i didn't vote for him the first time around 

363.52 365.15 A: well this a 

364.29 369.36 B: i think he's done the best that anybody could possibly do under horrific conditions 

368.86 370.50 A: i i agree 

369.72 375.86 B: especially those people wanted to be free it's so clear i don't think he's lied to us any place 

371.92 372.97 A: yeah 

375.41 376.25 A: yeah 

376.02 378.86 B: and if he did lie i don't think it was by 

379.09 380.33 B: intent 

380.11 381.36 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

381.03 386.44 B: just maybe something he didn't know about i mean look what they've found today those two thousand bodies 

386.30 388.80 A: oh i haven't been watching the news i haven't even seen that 

388.66 393.45 B: yeah a thousand bodies of people that saddam slaughtered 

388.93 390.17 A: (( i just i sa )) 

393.18 395.40 A: oh where they all buried in one grave 

395.25 396.53 B: apparently so 

396.42 397.27 A: (( oh i )) 

397.85 400.11 A: might have to go turn on the news 

398.76 404.37 B: it's quite a quick flash it looked like separate graves from what i saw but who knows they haven't uncovered them yet 

404.20 405.29 A: oh 

406.50 408.72 B: that's just one bad person you 

408.58 409.65 A: yeah 

411.57 412.81 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

412.42 421.84 B: know i tend to stay away from i travel a lot um i started driving up to northern california i go up once or twice a month rather than flying 

422.48 427.76 B: um for no other reason than at by the time i get through security and checkpoints i can be there 

427.57 428.70 A: yeah 

428.06 430.87 B: you know the same six hours i sit around in airports 

430.98 433.55 B: i'm in my own car and i'm there 

433.30 442.99 A: you know that is one thing i've never flown but since that since september eleventh no and i won't now [laughter] if it's some place you have to fly i'd just soon stay at home 

436.84 437.93 B: never flown 

442.79 444.11 B: there you go 

444.80 448.44 B: well it sounds like you're in a very safe little environment there 

449.82 451.19 A: yeah well 

451.41 452.26 A: i mean 

452.01 454.89 B: west virginia is probably not on any 

455.12 456.38 A: actually it's 

455.58 457.12 B: attack plan huh 

456.96 465.56 A: well actually because of the electrical plants and the i mean our power plants supply electric to a lot more than west virginia 

465.67 467.03 A: it is on 

467.07 472.06 A: whenever we're in school we learnt that it was on one of the top ten lists of not 

472.58 478.52 A: mhm what would you call it they had a top ten list on t._v. but it was a different type of list 

477.89 482.94 B: for someone to hurt that plant they'd have to be total strangers right to get in 

482.31 483.29 A: yeah 

483.38 484.55 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

483.92 487.54 B: and you'd certainly see 'em coming if they were flying over it 

486.88 489.47 A: well see there's so many of them close together 

489.48 490.33 B: yeah 

489.89 493.07 A: and i live on ohio west virginia boarder 

492.72 493.86 B: yeah 

493.25 502.93 A: and um there's right across the river there's two of them one of them's right in my sister's back yard and she was really scared to send her kids to school after that happened 

502.73 505.67 B: i'd be scared just to live that close to a power plant to 

505.32 506.28 A: yeah 

505.91 507.76 B: (( tell you the truth )) 

507.75 508.56 A: (( because yeah ))

513.96 514.89 B: from us 

514.92 521.32 A: you know i guess that don't that don't dawn on me about that because i never talk about it and i've never thought about it 

521.47 523.53 A: you know a power plant being there but [mn] 

523.31 525.39 B: yeah you don't follow the cancer 

525.57 528.25 B: scares and the cluster outbreaks 

525.62 526.50 A: no

571.65 574.96 B: and i saw what was happening and i heard them 

576.20 579.36 B: and i'll never forget the look on that reporter's face 

580.44 584.87 B: is he's so astounded and i thought that they were replaying something 

584.98 587.91 B: from the past as somehow i had missed it 

588.57 591.16 B: you know because i was still kinda sleepy and 

590.68 592.04 A: (( yeah yeah i ))
