49.11 58.55 A: so while it's i don't think it's on the surface i think it's in the back of my mind that that are certain things are going on and i do i am kind of aware of them 

53.18 54.97 B: (( [noise] [noise] right [noise] )) 

57.31 58.33 B: (( [noise] right [noise] ))

78.99 79.61 B: [noise] 

86.14 87.10 B: (( [noise] [noise] uh-huh )) 

86.84 89.55 A: so i've been very fortunate in that respect 

89.65 104.18 B: that is lucky especially you being in new york i'm here in texas so [noise] we're a little bit further away and you know [noise] i i have some friends who live in in new york but a different part of the state [noise] and everything so that you know so it was like i i didn't know anybody there so 

92.69 93.42 A: oh 

94.42 95.35 A: uh-huh 

100.52 101.43 A: uh-huh 

103.97 104.90 A: right 

104.14 113.26 B: i mean almost to me i mean you saw on the news forever but it was almost more like a dream you know [noise] and i think if i knew somebody first hand [noise] 

109.14 110.28 A: (( right mhm )) 

113.49 115.57 B: that had been involved in it 

115.92 118.73 B: it would have been a whole different situation 

118.39 119.34 A: right 

119.09 120.98 B: and it so 

120.94 124.46 A: um did did you watch a lot of the news coverage 

123.82 135.13 B: [noise] i watched a little bit i have i have three year old triplets though and so so when they were there you know they were really young at that point and i didn't want that kind of stuff on the t._v. 

125.48 126.35 A: uh-huh 

127.43 129.41 A: oh my goodness [laughter] 

134.58 136.03 A: right right 

135.25 140.85 B: 'cause i mean they wouldn't have understood it they probably wouldn't have even understood what was being seen [noise] but it's like 

139.57 140.51 A: right 

141.01 143.73 B: i needed to keep myself cheery for them 

143.29 144.64 A: right right 

143.80 150.96 B: so i we watched a lot of barney at that time [laughter] and everything and i think that's another reason why it wasn't 

146.04 148.58 A: [laughter] 

150.91 151.81 A: right 

151.07 156.67 B: it wasn't as realistic to me because i did try and tune out of everything 

156.64 157.62 A: right 

156.77 160.39 B: because of family life and things going on and so 

160.09 161.02 A: right 

160.60 162.31 B: you know i 

161.56 166.44 A: i know what you mean about it being so realist too 'cause i mean when i i woke up and 

164.74 165.55 B: uh-huh 

166.77 173.68 A: my mom had mentioned to me that a plane had gone into the first building and uh i probably i thought it was probably just a 

169.73 170.65 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

174.00 186.89 A: uh an airplane that got misguided or something so i put on the t._v. and then they actually showed the coverage live of the second one second plane and it it just looked like one of these movies you had seen in the past 

175.78 177.17 B: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

181.91 183.72 B: right 

184.64 185.56 B: (( [noise] )) 

186.82 188.10 B: (( [noise] right )) 

186.99 193.68 A: of one of these um tragedy movies happening it was so hard to comprehend and um 

192.37 194.09 B: (( yeah )) 

193.66 204.22 A: actually uh before the second plane hit my brother works in uh borough of manhattan community college which is about five blocks away and uh um he was telling me 

197.81 198.71 B: (( [noise] )) 

199.25 200.04 B: uh-huh 

201.12 201.96 B: uh-huh 

204.42 212.92 A: that he was watching people jump out of the first building and i kept telling him stop looking this is going to affect you stop looking 

212.41 213.95 B: (( right [noise] )) 

213.05 217.99 A: and uh he finally left the building and he started to uh walk away from the building 

215.84 217.41 B: [noise] 

217.93 219.25 B: uh-huh [noise] 

218.01 226.29 A: his building that is when the second tower fell and he then he had to start running because of the cloud of smoke was behind him so um 

219.71 220.49 B: [noise] 

226.42 240.11 A: i think it has affected him deeply i wish he would yeah i wish he'd open up with it he doesn't open up to me i wish he would to get you know deal with it but um it's it's hard to live here and not bump into someone who 

228.60 230.46 B: [noise] i bet it has 

233.61 234.62 B: right 

239.56 243.60 B: [noise] has been affected by it i'm sure and [noise] 

240.32 244.61 A: yeah yeah so it it really has been something 

244.35 253.34 B: you know that's right i think that was my way of dealing with it like i said i used the kids as an excuse to not watch it and not pay attention to it you know [noise] but it was 

250.28 251.03 A: (( mm )) 

252.24 253.28 A: right 

253.36 258.68 B: you know it's like so my life i can't say my life has changed that much i mean i'm
