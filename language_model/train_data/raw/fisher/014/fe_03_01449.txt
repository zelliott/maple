57.61 58.45 A: uh-huh 

62.17 72.60 B: when i was a little kid my mom always said you know i know exactly what i was doing the day that j._f._k. was shot and like for me i knew exactly what i was doing you know the the day the second plane hit

87.59 88.52 A: uh-huh 

88.16 90.51 B: and i just i don't feel comfortable 

90.61 98.42 B: putting their life in jeopardy in a in a tumultuous time like this now that the war's over you know i probably feel a little safer 

92.40 93.47 A: right 

94.68 95.59 A: right 

98.10 99.02 A: uh-huh 

98.78 103.16 B: but i don't know it still makes me nervous 

102.37 103.81 A: right 

103.79 104.59 B: (( so )) 

105.34 118.82 A: i know it's it's it's strange like i said i like because they are so young they're three now so they were you know a little over a year so they probably wouldn't even if i'd watched it but you know like i told the other guy it was like 

119.67 122.21 A: i think it was to keep my mood upbeat 

122.08 123.05 B: right 

122.24 130.84 A: and happy i mean it for them i mean it was more if i watched it i was going to dwell on it and my attitude was not going to be 

123.19 124.54 B: right for them 

131.14 137.31 A: in the best you know frame of mind to be taking care of them when they needed their mom and everything so 

133.11 134.17 B: right 

137.37 151.21 A: we watched a lot of barney and teletubbies [laughter] yeah [laughter] all the happy fun stuff that they like anyway [laughter] just to keep the other channels off because like you never knew when they were going to break in and tell you something you 

140.20 141.52 B: (( that's good )) 

151.26 153.16 A: really didn't want to see [laughter] 

152.42 161.87 B: absolutely yeah i i think that's a big issue too i tried it with the war and with the nine eleven not to let my kids watch too much i have an older daughter she's um 

159.52 160.85 A: (( right )) 

161.83 172.68 B: she's eight so she she was involved a little bit more you know she knew what was happening and they were talking about it at school and you know we really had to talk about it on the basis of you know wh- 

162.80 163.73 A: uh-huh 

165.33 166.37 A: right 

171.54 172.70 A: right 

172.87 182.96 B: there's a reckoning beyond this life and those men uh that did that have to reckon with that an- and that made her find more comfort you know because 

180.74 182.17 A: [noise] 

182.34 183.78 A: right 

182.97 193.98 B: she couldn't understand why someone would you know to to blow up the buildings was bad but to take the people on the plane and for them to kill themselves to do this was really traumatic for her 

193.72 207.76 A: right and that's you know and that's why i try and keep the war off i i turn it on after they go to bed at night but they're three now so i they i don't think they'd still understand but i do notice them watching t._v. more often and you never know what they're picking up and what th- 

194.47 195.20 B: so 

199.06 200.18 B: yeah 

206.86 219.49 B: well you know and it was so repetitive too you know the same images over and over and over again and i don't care if they're one or three or ten they're gonna remember that or identify with it on some level and like you said pick up on your mood 

208.89 210.32 A: right 

211.36 212.71 A: right 

214.59 215.68 A: right 

216.13 217.18 A: right 

219.21 221.02 A: right so 

219.54 227.86 B: you know for me i had school that night and it was just like it was a waste what a waste i mean there was no point in going because we were all so 

224.50 225.82 A: right 

227.69 229.85 A: sh- and right 

227.88 231.12 B: wrapped up you know in what was going on and 

231.01 243.43 B: you know and it just i think though it did make me step back and really think about what was going on you know it's like i've never seen my church so full as the sunday after nine eleven it was like wow 

235.01 236.17 A: mhm 

240.11 241.19 A: right 

243.25 249.53 B: and i think for a lot of people it was like okay what are you doing in your life what is the last thing that you said to your loved one that morning 

248.53 249.63 A: right 

249.52 260.01 B: you know 'cause how many mornings do does your husband rush off to work and you know you had a tiff and you forgot to say something and i think it really i think it it brought that to light 

254.60 255.57 A: right 

258.57 268.06 A: it brought people it brought people closer together and and and it showed you know th- the good stories came back to the forefront of the news you know it wasn't all 

266.63 267.89 B: yeah 

267.85 274.67 A: you know the news there was so much negativity of what was going on in the world the news looked hard to find the happy stories 

274.28 277.31 B: oh yeah absolutely absolutely 

275.06 283.35 A: it you know and i mean that was almost a good thing out of it at least you could see the you know those heart warming stories of this 

282.53 286.54 B: oh yes and for the first time in a long time we had some patriotism 

283.53 284.60 A: and everything 

286.31 287.33 A: right 

286.63 289.35 B: you know for a country that was you know so 

289.31 301.91 B: down on america because of all of this and that you know for the first time in a long time i really felt like our country pulled together and showed some support and i think that had nine eleven not happened and we were in 

295.48 296.45 A: uh-huh 

298.03 299.21 A: right 

301.95 306.16 B: um iraq i don't think that there would be as much support for the troops 

305.55 309.81 A: right i think there'd be a lot more people antiwar and 

309.14 315.86 B: [noise] yeah i mean and people have the right to protest but still we need to support our troops because they're serving our country 

313.35 314.27 A: yeah 

315.17 324.14 A: right and that that i mean i i don't necessarily support the fact that we're at war but while we're at war i'm going to support the people over there fighting 

324.07 330.44 B: oh definitely definitely well you know i don't think our our going into it i was just really didn't want to go to war 

324.18 326.51 A: you know for our country i mean 

330.00 330.98 A: right 

330.21 339.44 B: but as we were there and seeing the liberation of the people i mean i was really proud of us and i had big reservations about going to war but i felt like look we really did 

333.35 334.27 A: uh-huh 

337.24 338.94 A: right 

339.28 347.86 B: liberate these people and that's you know for so many other wars we've gone in for so many other reasons and i really i felt good about that 

340.51 341.50 A: right 

345.07 345.96 A: uh-huh 

347.49 348.38 A: right 

349.85 350.73 B: (( so um )) 

351.72 354.21 B: yeah nine eleven i think it definitely 

354.71 368.83 B: changed the way america thinks about a lot of things my girlfriend's baby was born that day that very day [laughter] so she was in labor i told her i go well i guess at least you had something on t._v. to watch [laughter] [laughter] she goes yes that's true 

357.66 358.49 A: (( so mhm ))

385.08 385.93 A: uh-huh 

385.64 392.91 B: and my baby's eleven months and i think about all the babies that were born after their their parents died after their fathers died and 

391.15 395.07 A: uh-huh i know that's got to be hard 

393.77 399.39 B: right what a legacy that's going to leave for them you know how are they going to cope with this

398.84 400.41 A: right 

399.74 401.15 B: huge thing

407.47 421.58 B: oh yeah you know and not only the unborn children but all the children that lost their parents and for having to cope 'cause you know it's hard enough to lose a husband or you know a wife but to lose your your mom or dad that's just that's really terrible
