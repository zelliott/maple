294.40 304.30 A: holy jesus we're in a lot of shit something bad is hap- you know it just felt like a doomsday i was like oh my god what's gonna happen next what's gonna happen next you know 

299.50 300.39 B: yeah 

304.16 307.20 A: and then i'm right next to a military post so 

306.99 319.49 A: we would hear like choppers go over and i'd be like hit the damn deck something's gonna blow us up [laughter] and it sounds funny now but at the time i really was scared you know

319.30 324.63 A: i was like holy shit it's my house next you know [laughter]

331.47 335.10 B: [laughter] 

333.62 335.55 A: you know at the time you're really 

335.34 350.10 A: scared and you're embarrassed that you're scared but yet you really are you're like oh my god how do i even deal with this and then you know that if there's any repercussions whatsoever you know as soon as they started pointing towards iraq and they started pointing towards you know these different coun- 

336.19 337.74 B: oh yeah 

349.91 352.26 A: ah countries being responsible for it 

352.40 365.75 A: that hits right home to me 'cause my husband's gonna be shipped out i'm like holy crap holy crap please don't take my husband away you know we got a [noise] brand new baby at home don't take him away from his daddy but yet in the same breath 

365.80 375.37 A: you know he needs to go [noise] and do his job that's what he's in the military for not to do a eight to five but to be available to go and take care of things should 

371.02 372.27 B: yeah i know 

375.50 376.98 A: it hit the fan 

377.07 380.87 A: you know which i totally understand and i have to get over it as a military wife 

380.68 392.67 A: and support him a hundred and ten per cent on whatever happens and i totally i'm not one of them oh my husband has to go i mean yeah it sucks and i probably would cry but i'm not gonna sit and wallow in it forever you know 

392.49 393.66 B: mhm 

392.52 405.84 A: because [noise] being a military wife you you know it could happen at any times so get over it these girls that cry for months on end what'd you think he was gonna work eight to five forever come on you know it's just part of the deal 

403.37 418.35 B: i know but you know sometimes love is just so overpowering that when you lose somebody that you love so much it's not so much that you know it's a shock that it happens as it is that it actually happened 

407.87 409.19 A: yeah 

418.05 420.37 A: right no i understand that too 

420.72 429.16 A: so it's so weird how it affected everyone in one way or another it affected every i didn't know anyone in the trade center noone 

421.18 421.99 B: but 

429.60 443.22 A: i didn't know anyone i didn't know anyone who knew somebody who knew somebody who knew somebody you know i'm way out here in arizona we don't really know that many people in new york or in places like that but i'll tell you when i saw those women's group with 

434.71 435.69 B: yeah 

436.84 437.49 B: (( mhm )) 

443.18 447.82 A: the group of women that got together that have all had babies since september eleventh 

448.37 459.95 A: and those babies that will never see their daddies and i boohooed for those mommies [laughter] forever you know they didn't even want to go on with life you know because 

459.87 466.36 A: they're at one of the most wonderful times in their your entire life you know and now they don't get to 

465.23 467.02 B: that would make me cry 

466.70 473.46 A: yeah oh my gosh i saw that on t._v. and i was like i just can't watch it anymore i just can't [noise] 

473.67 474.47 A: it was 

473.78 475.41 B: how's your husband doing

479.53 483.78 A: i can i cannot explain to you how blessed we are 

479.67 480.80 B: (( how )) 

484.40 488.59 A: i mean we thank god every day that he is still here 

489.27 491.40 B: how did he not get shipped out 

491.14 493.57 A: i by the grace of god 

494.22 503.43 A: only he's an instructor here at fort wachuka and he teaches the boys what they need to know to go 

503.50 504.52 B: mhm 

503.50 504.40 A: which 

504.42 509.59 A: sucks for them but it's great for me [laughter] you know i've still got my old man you know 

507.71 508.89 B: yeah 

509.44 514.94 B: mhm well you've really gotta you know count your blessings and stuff like that because 

510.21 511.30 A: so 

515.04 525.69 B: it's just that it's so hard to lose somebody that you love so much and if you don't have to lose 'em count your blessings 

528.50 530.46 B: plus too it's it's 

528.89 529.63 A: (( yeah )) 

531.57 534.26 B: (( [mn] sorry i'm a bit tired )) 

534.78 537.95 B: plus too it's always good to know that 

538.58 540.54 B: you got um 

540.78 546.87 B: ah your husband next to you and stuff like that i know that if i ever lost my fiance 

543.63 544.46 A: yeah 

547.23 552.54 B: i i'd just especially in something like this i'd just be i'd be horrified 

552.09 553.73 A: yep 

554.08 558.33 A: i can only imagine what some of these um families have already gone through 

558.46 564.60 B: oh like that one guy on the news where he was fighting he was um in the military 

564.75 571.36 B: um he was a marine and he was fighting and his brother got gunned down in las vegas 

571.48 574.19 B: that's actually where i am right now i'm on vacation 

573.93 574.84 A: mhm 

574.33 578.58 B: and the marine had to come home because his brother got gunned down in las vegas 

578.89 579.71 A: (( mm )) 

579.71 586.36 B: and i mean maybe that has no relevancy but i mean it's kind of you know ironic 

586.43 587.38 B: that 

587.67 595.45 B: that it would happen to his brother and stuff like that and that he was spared when he was the one going and fighting 

595.57 599.89 B: but in a way again it's a blessing he gets to come home and be with his family 

599.51 599.95 A: right
