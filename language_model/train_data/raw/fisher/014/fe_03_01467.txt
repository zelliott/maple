93.73 97.87 A: that's pretty common throughout the country that we've all felt that way 

96.48 104.52 B: oh yes oh yes and i think um even um i'm in canada and right now um of course um 

104.64 110.89 B: i mean every time when i think about september eleven i i sometimes tell myself did that really happen 

110.94 112.54 A: right right 

111.38 120.32 B: you know because it still it seems like it's a dream and i am not um directly affected by it 

120.24 121.10 A: uh-huh 

120.37 133.18 B: and yet i still feel that oh my gosh is that a dream so can you imagine those people who are directly affected by it those people who have families husbands wives children who were killed 

128.13 129.48 A: oh i know 

132.89 135.00 A: it's unbelievable yeah 

133.79 142.51 B: exactly and even um the people who went to help they also a lot of them died like you know the firemen and the police and everything 

140.87 142.98 A: right yeah right 

142.66 152.29 B: so sometimes it seems like um did that really happen you know it's like a nightmare you know it happened but part of you doesn't want it yeah
