32.86 35.28 A: oh okay 

35.34 40.10 A: well [sigh] i suppose we better stick to topic [cough] being as that's what they called about 

37.46 38.85 B: yeah [laughter] 

39.52 40.60 B: yeah 

40.28 53.52 A: [lipsmack] so anyway the topic was what uh changes uh if any have been made since september eleventh occurrence and how you are looking doing or what not so what uh what's up with you 

53.23 64.65 B: hm well it didn't change my life as far as doing things a lot you know what i mean i didn't change how i act or or things that i go out and do any more than i did before 

64.81 66.08 B: um [lipsmack] 

66.71 73.93 B: so i don't know [laughter] i mean of course i was influenced by it but as far as you know buying things or 

74.11 79.80 B: i don't know you know just stuff i di- that didn't really change it how about you [laughter] 

78.95 83.74 A: mm i would say it probably made more of an impact on us than that 

83.51 84.38 B: yeah 

83.77 88.66 A: um the uh uh various things i would say 

88.67 95.68 A: would've changed uh for us um you know i think we kinda lost our kind of um 

96.40 102.60 A: [lipsmack] trust and kinda like our assumption that 

102.99 112.28 A: life is pretty normal and nice and the people around you are pretty normal and nice as opposed to now it's uh you look at people and wonder 

105.30 106.24 B: yeah 

112.54 119.21 A: you know are you here legally or illegally in our country are you an illegal alien 

114.71 115.63 B: (( mm )) 

115.82 118.22 B: [laughter] i guess that's just being paranoid 

119.28 125.84 A: do you have the right to be here and if you're here legally are you doing the right thing 

125.21 127.19 B: (( yeah uh-huh mm mhm )) 

125.73 137.02 A: you know and so i guess it's made us more cautious especially of uh foreigners because obviously there's a group of 'em that are doing such a good job on doing the right things 

135.10 136.12 B: yeah 

136.48 138.10 B: oh yeah definitely 

137.78 143.79 A: and [lipsmack] it's also made us more wary of uh shutting our doors and locking our doors and 

143.82 154.04 A: being more cautious of you know should we go down to the mega mall or should we not go down to the mega mall what's going on politically it may not be a good deal [laughter] 

148.83 150.82 B: um yeah 

152.82 154.70 B: yeah [laughter] 

154.12 158.74 A: uh i know my husband he travels a lot uh for his job 

158.24 159.10 B: mhm 

158.88 161.87 A: and he's had to make some changes 

161.24 162.21 B: oh really 

161.88 172.29 A: uh yeah that especially when it first happened he had to drive some places that he used to fly because he couldn't get a plane 

167.60 168.52 B: yeah 

169.57 170.59 B: (( mm mhm )) 

171.81 172.68 B: wow 

172.76 176.23 A: and he then when he could get a plane 

176.32 180.97 A: he then had to uh show up two and three hours ahead of schedule 

181.66 191.23 A: you know just to get on the plane you know to go through all the procedures uh we left uh the week after my daughter and i did uh we had some place scheduled to be 

183.46 185.10 B: yeah yeah 

191.67 206.00 A: [lipsmack] and on a plane and we had to leave also earlier because uh you know they were going through all our luggage and one of my friends had a um that went with us had a fingernail file you know the kind that collapses down 

194.87 195.77 B: wow 

198.77 200.02 B: mhm 

204.81 206.43 B: yeah uh-huh 

205.98 211.19 A: they didn't think anything of it i mean you know you don't think things like that if you don't have that kind of a criminal mind 

207.55 208.60 B: yeah 

210.69 211.93 B: mhm 

211.29 218.29 A: and you know of course the people looking did and so you know and it was confiscated and you know understandably you 

214.28 215.25 B: mhm 

216.25 217.08 B: wow 

218.59 224.30 A: know so uh those kind of changes um you know time wise we have made [lipsmack] 

219.00 220.09 B: yeah 

224.26 228.33 B: hm yeah see i've never gotten you know i've never flown any ways so that didn't 

227.90 229.33 A: oh 

228.49 235.46 B: that's why it didn't influence me on that behalf and i've always been a little paranoid so as far as being cautious and stuff so 

235.49 240.44 B: it's just kinda like okay yeah i know now i'm paranoid for a reason [laughter] 

239.07 252.60 A: [laughter] well there's a lot of evil out there there's a lot of people doing wrong and s- not everything that people do or think or say is right i don't care what people say it's not right 

243.27 244.62 B: (( yeah there is )) 

249.32 250.26 B: mhm 

250.94 252.26 B: (( yeah mhm mhm )) 

252.62 260.42 A: and another thing that has changed is that we we've got uh four children our youngest now is sixteen but 

260.76 274.01 A: [lipsmack] we have changed in the fact that we sat down with 'em and kind of gave them a what maybe considered politically incorrect but i don't care i look at it from reality and say hey 

273.88 279.54 A: you know there are some people out there including you know things like muslims and what not their 

279.58 293.24 A: so-called religion is evil it is wrong and it's do- making these people you know mindlessly do some really stupid wrong and wicked things and this is not to be tolerated and it's 

280.80 281.72 B: mhm 

286.52 287.81 B: (( yeah )) 

293.18 299.71 A: you don't care culturally if it's cultural garbage or whatever the culture stuff there are things culturally that are wrong 

296.11 296.93 B: mhm 

299.39 300.96 B: mhm yeah mhm 

299.63 309.92 A: period okay and i said you know this is not right and you need to learn about a little bit about this so you can understand what's wrong with these people and be very wary of them 

310.04 315.24 A: uh because you know that is an undermining of everything that they do th 

315.28 317.51 A: it's a framework from where they come from 

317.58 321.35 A: and so you've gotta be very careful with those kind of things 

320.76 321.66 B: yeah 

321.59 323.14 A: (( [lipsmack] and uh )) 

323.16 328.97 A: you know so we we've done a lot of educating of our kids from that standpoint so that they can be much more discerning 

328.77 329.76 B: (( mm mhm )) 

328.98 335.76 A: and definitely not accepting of so called other you know cultural things that are definitely wrong 

336.12 339.15 A: you know so it's changed us from that standpoint 

338.68 339.66 B: yeah 

339.55 351.57 A: and i think another thing that's changed is that we are more conscious of people who hurt and we've spent more time praying for people who lost loved ones 

350.97 351.93 B: yeah 

351.73 355.08 A: and our i know our church has and you know 

355.47 359.96 A: realize that there's other people around you know obviously besides us in our own neighborhood 

360.30 366.06 A: uh it's made made us more aware from that standpoint i don't know about you did any of that kinda 

366.13 367.94 A: happen around where you live 

367.69 375.24 B: mhm well um actually where i live about n- not even twenty miles from me i'd say 

375.29 384.00 B: this was well maybe two months ago there was that guy smuggling people into united states did you hear about this 

383.29 385.70 A: no but they're happening all over the place right 

384.83 390.08 B: well he was uh giving getting birth certificates and stuff for people who had died and 

390.23 396.96 B: and giving them to these people and you know he was from twenty miles away and h- but he'd been doing this ever since september eleventh 

397.05 399.18 A: oh great guy 

397.91 407.25 B: yeah and they just busted him like two months ago or you know just yeah [laughter] but you know that's kinda like okay that hits home 'cause it's so close you know 

400.92 402.39 A: good for them 

406.45 411.04 A: yeah illegal alien trafficking uh that's so wrong 

408.31 409.28 B: mhm 

409.30 417.30 B: mhm and it was it was like you know it was people that were associated with um those groups you know mhm 

417.12 427.39 A: doesn't surprise me they have lousy values they don't care about lives the only thing that counts is themselves money and all that kind of stuff we don't need that kinda stuff 

425.59 426.45 B: yeah 

427.03 430.10 B: no i know they're so brainwashed you know there's [laughter] 

429.79 444.50 A: well i mean th- those group of people if you read anything about the news and what not and i'm not talking about the liberal media who tries to paint everything wonderful i'm talking about the reality of these kids you know th- over in that those countries they teach their kids like in palestine 

434.41 435.38 B: mhm 

437.95 439.21 B: yeah [laughter] 

441.48 442.30 B: mhm 

444.54 455.85 A: that it's great to grow up to be a suicide bomber and blow up you know and stuff like that and they they do that to their little kids and they say brainwash 'em into evil and i mean that's the kind of 

447.59 448.96 B: yeah yeah 

451.37 452.54 B: yeah 

453.01 453.96 B: mhm 

456.00 460.42 A: i don't care what you say culturally that stinks you know that's so wrong 

458.61 459.60 B: mhm 

460.12 461.84 B: oh yeah definitely 

461.98 464.64 A: you know so and then people who 

464.69 467.97 A: do perpetrate evil like september eleventh another thing is that 

468.25 478.44 A: you know we've come to think more in terms of hey that is definitely a wrong act to do and it should have consequences and those consequences you take those many lives my goodness 

473.35 474.25 B: mhm 

478.41 483.86 A: you need to pay the price you know because it's that's just not to be done 

480.27 481.40 B: (( yeah mhm mhm )) 

484.35 486.52 A: uh you just don't get away with that kinda junk 

486.16 487.86 B: yeah oh definitely 

487.45 490.45 A: so it's made us a lot more aware of that 

489.95 496.09 B: mhm yeah i'm yeah as far as what i was saying as not physically aware just as my 

496.26 500.47 B: how i act in public and things has hasn't changed but my 

500.49 502.45 B: self awareness has 

502.75 504.04 B: do you know what i'm saying 

504.46 506.44 A: mm not exactly but 

504.90 505.73 B: like 

505.96 514.36 B: i still go out and enjoy life and have fun but there's you know it's still in my head that okay all this stuff has gone on and

523.28 526.68 A: discerning cautious and so 

524.10 524.97 B: yeah 

527.17 531.11 A: [noise] less accepting of maybe people who 

531.15 531.97 A: you know 

532.01 543.26 A: run around and try to look good i mean even people like um ted bundy and geoffrey dalmer all those wicked people who bumped off oodles and oodles of serial killer stuff they ran around looking good 

533.57 534.42 B: yeah

548.49 549.52 B: mhm 

549.45 553.44 A: so that's i'd say it's it's changed um 

554.17 558.75 A: you know there have been lot of things like you say some things have stayed the same you know
