47.66 52.97 B: yeah it's it's yeah that's kind of exactly what it is it's i'm kinda far away from new york 

53.34 54.36 B: (( sort [mn] )) 

54.70 60.24 A: yeah although i guess i must say i am more aware of things going on 

60.85 64.35 B: oh yeah yeah and the wor- and world's level 

61.80 62.55 A: (( [mn] )) 

64.49 65.22 B: from 

65.83 67.84 B: (( well for me oh okay )) 

66.84 70.82 A: yeah yeah um my daughter was flying the other day and i 

71.19 74.98 A: thinking about her she was flying to the east coast and i was 

75.39 80.34 A: thinking about her probably more than i usually would have before nine eleven 

82.59 83.56 A: so 

83.73 85.35 A: but you don't um 

85.06 90.24 B: (( and do you know of any other people that where in the area or people who that might be affected )) 

89.40 95.06 A: um i a neighbour of ours son worked in the pentagon 

95.31 100.35 A: and he is he was very very close um just a matter of 

100.57 108.67 A: yards or [mn] away from where the plane crashed in fact he knew of he knew a lot of the people that were killed 

108.77 112.12 B: by it oh that must be hard for him 

111.17 115.39 A: right and so i guess that kind of brings it home it's it's you know and you 

115.64 122.08 A: i didn't know any of the people killed but the fact that i know of someone who knew of someone how about you 

122.37 132.05 B: ah no one in particularly that was hurt by it just people that were in the area and they saw the plane and they just they felt like the ground shaking and the loud bang when it actually 

131.03 132.62 A: really 

131.90 140.09 B: occurred like there were about a maybe a couple of blocks down at fordham university which is i think maybe about ten or fifteen blocks down 

139.95 150.13 B: from where it is i think i'm not sure exactly but yeah they felt it and heard it you know everything was stopped for that moment in time for them just 

144.43 145.76 A: oh 

148.30 160.49 A: well you know i think i think even for me i will never forget where i was when i heard that i i teach in school and someone came to school in they're from another place and they said have you had the radio on 

160.57 166.44 A: ah one of the towers was just bombed so i turned on the t._v. because i work in the the library there 

166.74 171.81 A: and it didn't take long and the second tower you know was was crashed into 

171.29 173.28 B: minutes after yeah [noise] right 

172.65 186.23 A: right so i guess for me i'll never forget where i was i'm old en- also enough to remember when john kennedy was was assassinated i was in my teenage years an- and that's another day that i'll just never forget 

187.19 189.63 A: and i think some of these um 

190.29 196.34 A: things have profound profound they just you just never forget them i guess 

195.95 198.63 B: [noise] it's just a part of history that's gonna be with you 

198.71 199.84 A: right 

199.38 201.81 B: you know even twenty thirty years later 

201.77 202.94 A: yeah 

201.84 206.82 B: you're gonna remember it because you were living at that time so i understand i understand 

204.14 205.34 A: right 

206.03 212.68 A: right um do you think that we will that something like that will happen again [mn] 

212.79 222.59 B: ah well there's always a possibility but with the added security i just it puts a little bit you know a little bit let lets people 

222.60 225.95 B: live that little bit at ease you know 

226.01 228.95 B: with added security i guess but i mean you know there's 

229.45 233.29 B: so much that security can do that is how i see it 

233.21 239.94 A: yeah i i personally um i think there has been enough safeguards put into affect and and um 

240.41 244.35 A: i'm not so sure that it will happen again although i don't think we have to 

244.47 248.30 A: to go i think we have to have a changed lifestyle 

248.47 249.44 B: (( oh yes [mn] )) 

248.50 251.63 A: but but we have to just to be aware of it 

252.45 255.88 A: i also think that i can't stop living just because of this 

256.42 258.47 B: oh no you've gotta keep going on 

258.13 259.50 A: yeah otherwise they 

258.57 259.82 B: (( because life's long )) 

259.58 262.23 A: otherwise they would have accomplished their goal 

262.43 264.04 A: is the way i feel 

264.66 269.87 A: um how about like with the war now do you think that that has will 

270.32 279.57 B: i really don't think that had ah ah maybe ah i'm not sure if there was any kinda association with it it's just maybe it was just another type of 

279.88 283.15 B: it's just on the agenda and this is what came up next 

282.95 284.36 A: yeah 

283.26 289.77 B: it's all about i think personally i'm i'm a finance major i think it was to boost the economy 

289.86 291.04 A: the war 

291.05 292.45 B: (( the war was [noise] [noise] )) 

291.84 302.84 A: [laughter] you know [laughter] you and i are in complete agreement with that i i just really don't think that we needed to 

303.28 304.86 A: go to war 

304.66 307.83 B: it's just an economic little factor that's that's 

307.11 308.14 A: right 

308.06 309.81 B: (( what i [noise] you know that's )) 

310.35 317.23 B: (( what i think but it's somewhat over now and maybe [noise] i don't know there's probably too long [noise] so )) 

317.10 318.32 A: yeah 

318.45 326.66 A: um um i i i'm glad we didn't go to war after nine eleven because i i think that would have been the wrong thing to do 

326.15 334.97 B: [noise] oh well yeah it's good we waited a coup- a year or so a year or half to begin to strike [noise] and then you know just to because 

330.03 331.12 A: yeah 

335.13 337.02 B: people [noise] needed time to mourn 

338.11 341.25 A: right and and just plain recover right

355.03 356.00 A: oh yeah 

359.80 367.14 A: okay so when you were living on the coast did you feel an added added threat from terrorism 

365.94 366.95 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

367.41 371.35 B: no not not really just [noise] i didn't see 

371.70 374.03 B: houston or austin being such a big 

374.09 379.12 B: thing like new york [noise] that would be targeted by such you know terrorists groups and stuff

378.48 379.58 A: (( right ri )) 

379.44 382.99 B: [noise] it's a thing that didn't have much of a relevance [noise] not relevance just

384.62 390.07 A: okay you didn't think well what about with the oil fields and the refineries and stuff

411.57 422.52 A: um i i just can't see us being targeted for anything um you know like in rural texas there's nothing here [laughter] trees and farm land so why would people 

423.03 424.00 B: yeah 

423.23 426.31 A: why would the terrorists want to do anything here 

426.01 429.66 B: [noise] that's that's true we're just too far away [noise] 

429.00 432.46 A: right [laughter] besides it's too darn cold

463.09 464.96 A: (( good alright )) 

464.66 468.41 B: [noise] so hopefully it pays off [noise] hopefully they get something out of this [noise] 

466.25 467.43 A: yeah [laughter] 

468.04 470.57 A: i'm hoping too um 

470.67 475.22 A: if it doesn't i guess we'll find out i don't know how long the the ah do you know what the 

473.83 478.20 B: yeah i i'm not sure [noise] [noise] 

475.52 479.43 A: the time the downtime is between getting paid and 

479.55 485.29 B: [noise] and talking ah i have no idea a a friend just told me yesterday to sign up and they called me today 

485.39 487.03 B: so [noise] 

485.98 488.86 A: okay and you have friends that have gotten paid 

489.03 494.15 B: oh no he just signed up the day before and he told me to sign up so i might as well 

491.90 493.65 A: okay all right 

493.76 496.18 A: so let's just hope this isn't a scam ha 

496.17 497.75 B: (( yes hopefully [noise] we'll )) 

496.68 499.27 A: [laughter] 

497.85 500.32 B: make some money out of this but um 

500.90 502.47 B: (( ah i )) 

502.54 505.34 B: [noise] have you done any travel yourself lately [noise] 

505.39 516.26 A: um no we were well actually we were in d._c. in august and um it you know speaking of nine eleven it was rather um 

510.70 511.88 B: (( [noise] [noise] huh )) 

516.18 522.10 A: nerve racking because in alrada d._c. they would not let any one get out of their seats 

522.46 526.77 A: we had to stay in our seats and because of the added security and stuff 

527.34 530.59 B: (( ha [noise] [noise] oh no rest room breaks [noise] or anything [noise] oh yeah that )) 

527.37 528.29 A: so 

529.21 543.86 A: nothing no they would not let you go well they they announced it before saying that they would now be com going into this um secure air space and noone would be allowed to get out of their seats so if you needed go to the rest room or whatever you had to do it now 

533.92 535.09 B: (( makes sense though )) 

544.26 551.61 A: but as we um got off our plane in d._c. and stuff we really didn't see any added security or anything but 

551.68 556.36 A: you know in the buildings there were i couldn't go into a building without going through an x-ray machine 

557.20 559.06 B: (( that's everywhere [noise] )) 

557.26 558.26 A: and 

559.19 568.50 A: right and they had all these concrete barriers in front of the national buildings and stuff and it it took away from the beauty of them and it also 

567.54 569.57 B: (( oh i could imagine mhm )) 

569.23 577.81 A: it also it drove home what terrorism can do i guess and what war can do you know you you just think wow 

577.93 579.08 A: it could have been 

579.73 587.76 A: it could have been more it could have been worse and then i think about the people over in iraq and all these other people that are bombing and and what they must be going through because 

586.89 593.80 B: they're going through exactly what i mean they're you know it is not their fault but it's like they're having to suffer for it 

593.54 594.79 A: right 

595.20 598.72 A: because of one or two people basically yeah 

598.71 599.89 B: exactly
