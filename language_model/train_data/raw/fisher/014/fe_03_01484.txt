292.00 294.70 B: yes it was very very sad 

294.10 296.23 A: was that because of the time 

296.98 299.23 A: where it could've been more people um 

299.30 310.71 A: someone told me that it could've been up to like fifty or sixty thousand and i never understood whether that was because it was so early or [noise] i don't know maybe you
