9.12 10.37 B: same to you 

10.42 13.87 A: well how did things change after september eleven for you 

14.81 21.13 B: i started watching the news and keeping up with the world events a little bit more than i did before 

21.23 25.89 B: i had always kinda felt if it didn't happen around here then it didn't affect me 

26.38 37.07 A: wow well the um some of the planes that that hit the world trade center left from here and i had a friend on there so that um and i was in the military at the time 

37.15 52.00 A: so uh things changed quite a bit for me with uh reporting for duty and um also i gave blood that day immediately and it seemed like it wasn't needed but i went anyways you know 

40.94 42.63 B: (( i would imagine so )) 

52.11 55.34 B: yeah just a feeling of having something to do to help 

56.01 57.01 B: we uh 

57.20 60.13 B: had blood drives here with my son's junior high 

60.90 68.58 B: and my aunt is a nurse at the local hospital and she went up there she said it was pretty tremendous to look at 

68.99 70.21 B: and 

71.59 74.67 B: with my kids and and teaching them about 

75.47 86.03 B: patriotic american duties and freedoms and things like that because they had a lot of questions about why these people did what they did and the only thing i could answer to them was i don't know 

86.54 89.03 B: 'cause i really didn't understand it myself 

89.23 101.41 A: right see i don't have kids i'm single not married and um don't have any children so i didn't have those questions to answer i think the questions i had were all internal and just trying to sort it out for myself 

101.01 102.11 B: yes 

102.09 109.27 A: now have things continue continued to change for you since then have have anything have you been traveling as much 

109.39 116.52 B: well i don't travel that much anyway and i don't fly i'm scared to fly in the first place i've never flown on a plane before 

116.02 117.12 A: never 

116.68 117.69 B: never 

117.27 118.41 A: (( [laughter] wow )) 

117.90 127.23 B: i'm thirty one years old i have never been on an airplane [laughter] and we don't have trains in this area i have rode on a bus but it's been 

127.58 129.07 B: several years 

129.38 130.86 B: since i have 

131.00 132.68 B: and 

133.56 140.47 B: the last trip that we took out of state was probably seven or eight years ago so the travel's really not affected 

140.53 144.28 B: but i think after that happening if i were 

144.42 145.96 B: to fly on a plane 

146.15 147.87 B: i'd be scared to death 

148.27 150.95 B: not just you know for the fear of flying but 

151.26 155.64 B: (( who's going to jack the plane and fly it into another building see i was flying about um for total time in the air )) 

157.45 161.02 A: (( yeah )) 

161.18 163.24 A: (( it's just )) 

163.37 165.13 A: (( crazy wow in )) 

164.97 165.75 B: (( i was )) 

165.66 172.54 A: the amount of time so i i thought of it like that and after september eleventh and i said to myself there's 

172.48 183.72 A: there's no way i want to travel that much because i figured before september eleventh my number would be up eventually just out of the just the amount of flying i was doing 

179.94 180.86 B: (( spending about a week )) 

183.91 188.69 A: and so i do just about everything i can not to have to travel now 

190.02 193.71 B: (( per year in the air yeah i i totally understand why that )) 

194.04 197.79 B: just it puts a thought in everyone's head i think that 

198.12 204.08 B: it it one it was unexpected and two they were right here in the united states 

203.42 205.01 A: mhm 

204.93 207.39 B: and people get up 

208.03 213.19 B: do their normal morning routine get on an airplane and the next thing you know 

214.05 219.48 B: it's being hijacked and being flown into a plane where thousands of people are killed i mean that's 

219.72 223.03 B: that's just unbelievable 

223.55 226.81 B: and i couldn't understand what would possess someone to do that 

226.96 227.96 B: but 

228.20 235.29 B: i try to keep up more with everything that's going on now try to learn more and be aware of things around me and

237.40 238.37 B: you know 

237.47 244.08 A: no- now do you live anywhere oklahoma city because of the events that happened there

246.44 247.87 B: of oklahoma city 

247.49 253.87 A: and and how did that did that affect you as much more that the september eleven 

252.83 255.29 B: i think it did because it was closer to home 

255.44 256.33 A: mhm 

256.32 257.72 B: and it wasn't 

258.48 265.62 B: it wasn't a terrorist type i mean it was obviously but not like you would expect from another country 

266.33 269.86 B: i think it shocked me more so with that because 

269.93 271.69 B: he was american 

271.94 273.45 B: he was 

273.97 277.59 B: like your every day citizen you know in appearance 

277.47 278.90 A: right 

278.72 282.09 B: and i mean in my area 

282.49 284.72 B: there are that many from 

284.92 290.54 B: overseas like from pakistan or iraq or iran or anything like that there's not that many here 

290.13 291.46 A: (( right [cough] [noise] )) 

290.83 296.53 B: the majority of people are white african american or latin american 

297.59 304.27 B: so to see someone like that and after the seventh sept- ah september eleventh attack 

304.55 308.95 B: one man in our area i know he's from pakistan 

309.33 310.91 B: put on his 

311.55 313.77 B: i don't know what they call those outfits 

313.21 314.62 A: mhm 

314.36 319.58 B: solid black with a black turban on his head toting a sign

335.76 336.66 A: (( [noise] )) 

339.11 342.12 B: whatever charge i don't know i didn't follow up with it 

342.50 343.49 B: but 

344.37 354.02 B: it just makes you feel like here in your country where you have the freedom to do all these wonderful freedoms that you have it doesn't seem like 

354.26 356.57 B: you have any freedom whatsoever 

356.32 357.26 A: (( mm )) 

357.72 358.31 A: (( [noise] ))

359.75 361.21 B: that's really frightening 

361.11 368.18 A: on- one of the things is i i did a lot of world travel before september eleventh and um when i had a vacation 

368.12 378.53 A: um since then i i said i'm not going anywhere but to see the united states i wanna see some place here that i haven't seen and i went out to um

412.00 417.50 A: oh yeah wild so you do have a military connection of of some sort then 

417.16 423.34 B: right and when they buckled down after september eleventh they totally closed

424.17 425.66 B: right which 

424.69 425.98 A: right 

426.25 434.08 B: on one level having kids and being involved in soccer that's where our soccer games were held was on their polo field 

433.83 434.97 A: mhm 

434.38 442.20 B: so our city people were scrambling around trying to find some place to put eight thousand people for soccer games 

442.64 454.75 B: and that was for my kids that they you know they couldn't understand about a terrorist attack but they knew their soccer had been disputed and you know oh my gosh we're right here 

454.86 457.65 B: next to this military base and it's 

457.75 459.97 B: an artillery base at that

507.62 510.54 B: which pays better than the military around here so 

509.37 522.36 A: it sure does it sure does [laughter] so how how do you think the uh world is going to be for your kids now and is your outlook your future outlook for your children does it feel different 

522.99 526.38 B: well my son has decided he's going into the military 

526.15 527.73 A: and does that scare you 

527.69 530.50 B: on one level it does because he is my son 

530.81 532.80 B: but on the other level i'm proud 

533.25 535.29 A: mhm 

533.25 545.53 B: that he wants to stand up and fight for his country the way so many others have done and i asked him well what if we go to another war at that point and you have to go and you have fight and something happens to you 

545.97 552.26 B: are you prepared for that and he said mom when i sign that dotted line i'm prepared for everything 

552.35 558.47 B: and he's fourteen years old so i you know if that's what he wants to do then i can support him for that 

558.48 560.61 B: and i think from my kids 

562.08 563.15 B: (( if )) 

563.56 565.31 B: they learn as they go 

566.48 576.47 B: i think they'll be okay i mean we can't control the whole entire wor- world and what everyone's doing and the best we can do is just hope and pray that 

570.20 572.12 A: mhm right 

577.08 579.04 B: everything'll be okay for them 

579.31 581.38 B: i mean it when you look at 

581.72 583.18 B: our parents 

583.48 587.22 B: how different it was for them with vietnam and everything going on 

587.41 597.06 B: compared with their parents having korean war and world war one and world war two and you know it's just getting more and more intense 

592.47 593.03 A: (( [sigh] )) 

597.08 599.44 B: as each generation comes along
