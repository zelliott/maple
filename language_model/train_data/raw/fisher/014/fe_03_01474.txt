266.74 268.87 A: (( well yes it )) 

267.68 268.62 B: so 

268.93 282.67 A: has i think personally we shouldn't have or we should try not to make as many changes to our daily lives it's what the terrorists are after trying to make us scared and fear going out into the streets so i'm trying to not give them what they want 

269.01 269.97 B: um 

282.76 287.68 B: well exactly but y- are you more aware of your surroundings 

286.52 288.94 A: yes i am and shoot 

289.22 298.60 A: i've i think twice about wonder whether i wanna just drive somewhere if it's going cross country or if i'm gonna take a plane i i'm kinda cautious on that

299.46 300.49 B: (( mhm )) 

300.13 312.08 A: i'm not sure whether i'm actually up to that because i was invited to go to houston texas um like three weeks ago and i was like um no i'm not really up on flying right now

321.55 323.47 A: can't do much about it 

321.82 322.68 B: (( um )) 

323.14 331.06 B: no there's nothing you can do about it because you could be anywhere with anybody [noise] doing anything and and something could happen you know 

331.78 333.75 B: the terrorists are 

334.70 343.19 B: they're evil and they don't care they have no regard for human life you know look how they put the children in the front line over there

338.87 339.54 A: (( they )) 

342.97 343.77 A: yeah 

344.15 346.74 B: and that's a sick thing [laughter]

385.92 398.16 B: yeah we did too i mean i'm always made sure there's plenty of food around but um as far as keeping bottled water um we've never done that because our drinking water is safe here 

386.11 387.97 A: (( just to be on the safe side )) 

389.62 390.74 A: (( yeah )) 

393.16 394.23 A: (( yeah we ))

398.41 408.02 B: and um we've always just you know used our city water but um i did stockpile some extra water just in case 'cause that would be a good source too 

408.46 409.95 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

410.42 424.16 A: we bought flashlights and candles uh i went on a candle shopping spree for some reason i after september eleventh i think subconsciously i was like what if something happens candles flashlights just be sure 

424.08 425.87 B: mhm yeah

434.42 435.89 B: mhm 

435.22 436.21 A: so 

436.22 439.16 A: it's everywhere you can just 

439.84 448.01 A: uh feel it i mean and every day on the news i mean i'm not sure how it is in um other parts of the country right now but 

447.88 456.37 A: for the longest time the past five years that i've been living in maryland i'm since i'm so close to d._c. we hear all about the politics it's on the news all the time 

456.24 457.23 B: (( mhm )) 

456.24 467.32 A: and it's politics what bill they just passed what you know and now it's it's even worse you're you hear nothing but politics and what decisions have been made it's 

466.46 467.46 B: (( uh-huh )) 

468.46 469.26 B: yeah 

468.57 473.29 A: you're aware of everything that's happening the media's making sure you're aware of that 

473.04 478.19 B: certainly the how how do you commute to work do you just drive or do you take a 

477.07 479.17 A: um yeah drive 

479.00 479.88 B: okay 

479.18 480.01 A: (( car )) 

480.14 484.59 A: because i need my little freedom to go on base for can- for um 

484.64 495.83 A: lunch because the selection is kinda limited but yeah but i might start taking the metro to try and help with the little const- conservation of gas and everything [noise] 

484.91 485.82 B: (( uh-huh )) 

488.20 489.09 B: mhm 

495.80 497.95 B: well yes and you know 

497.28 499.59 A: (( [noise] yeah [mn] )) 

498.58 504.71 B: i- i'm i think there are you know the the oil industry has certainly put a 

505.27 517.40 B: a stop to making our cars more efficient and so forth and i think they can be a they have the technology to make 'em a lot more efficient but then it would um suppress the oil industry and 

517.34 521.84 B: and then what would they do you know you do one thing and it affects the other [laughter] 

521.33 522.09 A: (( yeah )) 

522.06 523.07 B: um 

522.83 524.16 A: kinda stuck 

524.35 531.86 B: but we try not to drive as much as usual and like i say we did you know avoid the stations that we know purchased 

532.10 532.87 A: yes 

532.56 534.94 B: iraqi oil um

536.76 537.54 A: yeah 

539.89 546.33 B: and i do have to say i don't believe that we've driven a lot less than we did before because of the gas prices either but 

546.39 546.97 A: (( yeah )) 

546.48 547.51 B: um 

548.88 552.79 B: other than that we really haven't made any changes so 

551.93 552.63 A: mm 

553.03 556.74 A: well i've noticed people around where i go to school they're 

556.91 563.61 A: they seem to be scared of of the indian people that are um at our school that are going to school and i'm like 

563.71 578.67 A: well you can't do that you can't base an entire you know belief system on what a few people did you can't do it and i i find myself defending people that i don't even know like you know she's not part of it he's not part of it just 

578.17 579.31 B: (( mhm ))
