17.47 19.25 A: oh why don't you go first 

18.91 33.05 B: okay um this is my second call with fisher i just had one just a couple of minutes ago and the topic apparently is the same we're supposed to discuss any personal significant changes we have gone through since nine one one 

33.26 42.09 B: and to be honest with you i don't think our family has really undergone any dramatic changes other than perhaps being 

42.20 54.68 B: more kind and gracious to friends families and strangers as a result of of the tragedy that happened um i i i don't think our travel plans have been curtailed 

54.64 67.61 B: um i know we have found ourselves giving more of ourselves to charities and volunteering help uh more so than than before even though we were involved in it quite a bit uh 

67.60 73.02 B: before nine one one but it just seems to take on a an added sense of um 

73.23 76.26 B: urgency and realism i think for us 

76.57 82.41 B: but uh we haven't really undergone anything else significant have you oh 

82.86 83.90 A: um 

84.06 87.12 A: not not per se um 

87.37 94.14 A: we we did have some travel plan changes immediately after the fact um we were scheduled to 

94.23 96.84 A: fly to my husband's um 

97.08 110.77 A: family for christmas and i just didn't want to travel on christmas day i was a little bit [laughter] i was a little i was a little paranoid and and there were some sparks there because he wasn't quite as paranoid as i was [laughter] but um 

101.81 103.14 B: i don't blame you 

110.60 113.28 B: did you did you travel after that then 

113.17 119.06 A: uh i have not yet traveled by air but just because the opportunity has not 

116.33 117.25 B: okay 

119.16 122.98 A: has not uh arisen um but 

123.47 126.15 A: but my husband has traveled quite a bit 

123.50 124.89 B: i haven't either 

125.77 135.94 B: yeah mine has too he was he was i think reluctant for that first flight it was always kind of forefront in his mind what if something happened what if what if 

134.42 135.17 A: (( yeah )) 

135.80 148.19 B: what if but he said as soon as he entered the airport and saw all the security measures that were in place and um they they could easily spot the marshalls that were flying on the planes with them 

148.16 158.00 B: he said all the the fears just dissipated and he just went about his business as normal and and uh and he has to travel for his job so he had no choice really 

157.75 159.46 A: right right 

158.70 159.66 B: but 

159.78 161.74 A: yeah we did not um 

162.16 169.71 A: you know we haven't as a family we haven't traveled we we have done you know day trips and car trips but we have not traveled by 

169.88 171.09 A: by air 

171.67 175.29 A: so that has not been a problem um 

176.12 181.80 A: i i have to say that when we were um and it and i'm not sure if it 

181.82 191.77 A: was nine one one that presented this issue or the beginning of the war recently but we were scheduled to go to new york city 

191.88 193.85 A: the weekend that 

193.98 197.04 A: the weekend after the war actually started 

196.69 197.70 B: okay 

197.36 202.45 A: and that presented some issues for me as well [laughter] 

201.87 204.38 B: was it the the security issue 

203.84 207.16 A: well it i just was i was just 

204.75 205.56 B: or just 

205.96 207.51 B: (( unsettled yeah )) 

207.03 214.93 A: yeah i was very unsettled about being there and and using the public transportation and originally going into it i was 

214.80 229.50 A: and then i found myself once i was there saying well i i just didn't feel the same way i thought i was going to be more paranoid when i was in the city and it just it just dissipated as soon as i started to use the subway and you know 

229.72 231.23 A: (( um bu- )) 

231.27 234.44 B: you know i think for us i think that when you think of the 

234.50 241.05 B: sheer number of americans you know that that i think that we have safety in numbers 

240.90 251.73 B: um when you think of that these terrorists acts if they are going to occur they're actually going to be very small pockets i mean it it it was a horrible horrible thing that happened in new york 

248.08 248.95 A: correct 

251.85 260.67 B: and and my god we lost you know three thousand people just like that but when you think of how many people there are in america 

260.98 268.54 B: it just i think the odds of something actually happening to an individual would be staggering you know what i mean 

267.46 269.64 A: right right right 

269.03 273.84 B: you know and and i think for somehow that for some reason i think that i find that calming 

273.86 279.36 B: and maybe it's just [laughter] maybe i'm just not looking at it like other people do but 

279.54 282.73 B: i just i refuse to give in to the um 

283.06 290.24 B: the terrorists you know by allowing fear to rule our lives if anything it's just made me just all the more 

290.68 295.43 B: cognizant of of how precious life is and live you life to the fullest 

295.22 296.03 A: yes 

295.97 305.04 B: each and every day but do you have um school age children have you noticed any changes in the in the schools' safety and security since this happened 

304.52 314.56 A: uh i have not uh and i do have sch- i have three school age children i have not noticed any significant i mean immediately following 

314.58 320.50 A: nine eleven yes um you know they were very security conscious um 

320.79 331.04 A: now the only change really in our school we we're in a little suburban little ur- you know very suburban area so it's not 

328.68 329.54 B: mhm 

331.06 335.85 A: um a city or anything and i think we're very complacent feeling that 

336.22 337.48 A: we're safe 

337.84 347.28 A: um we have visitor badges that we have to go in and sign in on and we're supposed to wear them throughout the school which is new other than that there have been no changes 

344.76 345.80 B: (( yeah yeah well )) 

345.87 346.71 B: yeah 

346.99 360.11 B: well got the same thing where they lock all the doors uh from the outside apparently you can leave from the inside but from the outside all the doors have been locked except for the one main entrance and you have to go right into the office to register 

359.74 360.65 A: right 

360.01 366.82 B: and sign in because before people would just come in and go out as as they pleased and you know it could of been anybody 

367.10 381.95 B: but um i i know that they have put we we our children are are grown and out of the house now but i i've read that they've got um they were talking about installing metal detectors but i don't think they went through with that but we live out in a a farming community and 

382.36 389.22 B: god knows [laughter] you know who's going to do that but then again no place is safe any more it seems 

383.70 384.67 A: [laughter] 

388.97 389.86 A: i know 

390.33 396.10 A: it's just like i said it it was easy and i guess that's why i was uncomfortable with new york city 

396.27 402.10 A: i would have felt no fear at all being in my own home town but feeling like if i was 

399.53 400.57 B: mhm 

402.15 408.64 A: because who who's going to want anybody you know who's going to want to do anything to the town i'm from you know 

408.42 417.47 B: and yet that you know that could be one of the very reasons why they would for all you know like i mean we live uh within a twenty five mile radius of a nuclear power plant 

412.19 413.87 A: (( exactly right )) 

417.54 424.60 B: and they definitely increased the security after nine one one because of fears of attacks on that 

424.70 436.72 B: um they used to even have tours where you could go in and and they would happily show you the the facility if you signed up in advance and all tours that were cancelled which is a shame for school kids 

437.12 443.45 B: and like out here i know with the farmers i read in our our local newspaper that um 

443.46 456.28 B: the farmers are having to increase security because that's one thing you never think about i mean there's about three hundred acres of farmland and the farmers are usually one guy is out in the field and everybody else is at work in town 

456.47 458.51 B: who watches their crops 

458.78 473.29 B: you know and and anybody could come in and um do bioterrorist acts on their on their uh feed and on their cattle you know and and what a horrible way to to harm the u._s. is to their food supply 

472.88 477.02 A: exactly wow see i hadn't even given any thought to that 

474.33 475.73 B: but yet i don't see 

476.40 482.33 B: i know a lot of people haven't and uh it kind of alarmed me at first when i read about it in the paper but 

482.48 487.40 B: what can you do i mean who's going to sit there and watch their farm twenty four hours a day 

487.54 492.73 B: [mn] but you just never know that's just it you know you just you just never know but 

493.14 499.14 B: i guess i just have faith that uh if my time is up my time is up you know and and uh 

499.40 509.84 B: all all we can do is is try to cooperate as much as we can you know with uh authorities but [mn] and just pray that nothing happens [laughter] so yeah so 

508.63 509.66 A: yes 

510.34 511.42 A: yes 

510.49 512.46 B: it it's strange 

511.84 516.58 A: it um it amazed me that my children were not as 

516.65 522.46 A: were not affected emotionally just because it was close to home and 

519.84 521.52 B: (( you know that's why as )) 

522.16 523.63 B: yeah 

522.86 523.93 A: um 

524.26 536.10 A: it was almost as if they wanted nothing to do with it they didn't want to know anything about it it was like too much for them to handle they could see that mom was having a tough time handling it 

536.29 539.71 A: and they didn't they didn't even want to go there 

539.76 544.22 A: it was very it was very odd and they have you know 

544.46 554.61 A: um we have gone to ground zero and you know they have seen it but they didn't see it before you know they don't know the magnitude of it because they're children 

554.93 555.94 A: um 

555.68 557.49 B: what are the ages of your children 

557.28 560.80 A: uh i have ten eight and seven 

560.52 561.57 B: (( oh okay )) 

561.36 563.20 A: so um 

562.27 564.70 B: very impressionable ages 

564.13 565.85 A: but my um 

566.21 568.30 A: my son drew a picture 

568.87 572.83 A: um in the fall they had a they had a 

573.02 578.49 A: contest not a contest but they were supposed to draw a picture about nine eleven and he did 

578.43 584.12 A: and and um his was firefighters going into the buildings and 

583.98 597.31 A: so i guess he did get a little bit out of it when we went to new york over the summer and you know he saw ground zero and he saw the rest of new york and just about everywhere you turned there was a tribute to the world trade center 

597.16 598.23 B: certainly 

597.84 599.89 A: and so i guess he
