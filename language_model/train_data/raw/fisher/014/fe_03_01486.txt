93.92 94.88 A: well 

95.29 98.29 A: well my end it changed i think it made 

98.31 101.02 A: everyone's life change not only mine 

101.17 110.32 A: and where i think people became more aware of an- of who they were who they are and of other people's feelings and emotion i think it brought up u- 

110.34 111.92 A: more people together 

112.83 117.95 A: because when that happened there was death all around us it was such a sorrowful event 

118.29 120.97 A: that many lives were affected 

121.02 126.19 A: ah i know at philadelphia people were frightened because 

126.21 130.63 A: a if you recall it was on the news about the liberty bell and um 

131.07 136.22 A: ah tesna street all were all the historical places are that we all had to be careful 

136.48 139.01 A: but yet we had- resume our normal life 

140.32 141.76 B: that's true 

142.39 146.57 B: the most stressful point for me was about 

144.51 145.61 A: (( oh [noise] )) 

146.75 154.02 B: the first couple of hours because i have a sister and brother in law who i thought worked in that section of new 

154.73 155.59 A: oh 

156.73 162.69 B: york and luckily they [laughter] neither of them were working in there that day 

163.34 167.42 B: i well actually my sister was in new york but in a different section 

167.82 169.84 B: at the time 

170.54 176.01 B: but i did what [sigh] i i did the 

176.08 177.09 B: (( what's )) 

177.50 184.50 B: called the families and whoever could get whoever could get to me first 

184.59 188.51 B: they had both my cell number and they had my work number 

188.81 192.05 B: and within an hour i found that everybody was 

192.17 194.66 B: all present and accounted for 

194.10 195.12 A: (( that's good uh )) 

196.35 198.11 B: yeah [sigh] 

199.10 201.09 B: (( i )) 

201.47 205.43 B: i even stayed at work a little while longer that day 

205.73 217.26 B: for for at least one hou- for at least one selfish reason was that i didn't want to really deal with the traffic going home that day because i 

217.89 222.24 B: it was a such a beautiful day and i rode a bike and i ride a bike 

223.80 231.02 B: but the weirdest part about it was when i went home about left for home at about i guess one or two o' clock or so 

231.40 237.24 B: there was nobody underline the word nobody on the road 

237.28 238.75 B: on arch street 

239.01 240.05 A: really 

240.96 242.41 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

242.25 246.84 A: i was at work that day but i i take a twelve- i um 

247.84 249.98 A: i was in center city that day 

250.12 252.22 A: and i had to take twelfth street 

253.38 254.71 B: yeah 

254.04 258.08 A: and i don't remember it as such i but you continue 

258.14 260.69 A: it was empty arch street 

261.04 262.25 B: oh yes 

262.28 264.44 B: (( it was empty )) 

264.69 269.48 B: on arch street it was almost like a sunday the amount of traffic 

269.54 271.38 B: on market street [mn] 

271.61 275.31 B: and through university city 

275.78 284.43 B: but i just figured because well in my line of work i went through the reaction of oklahoma city 

284.80 290.09 B: and now i went through the reaction of the world trade center disaster 

291.69 296.91 B: and essentially they needed somebody to kind of cover the phones for a while 

297.17 303.82 B: so i said i'd hang for a couple of hours just because i didn't want to be a biker out amongst all 

303.91 307.66 B: all that traffic trying to get to places 

311.40 313.71 A: you drove from center city 

313.75 315.21 A: to upper darby 

315.20 316.98 B: yeah i'm a bicyclist i 

316.99 320.20 B: (( i i'm not a motorcyclist )) 

320.71 321.58 A: oh 

324.03 329.35 A: well i know people who are terrified and i think were frightened of what could happen here 

332.68 333.98 A: don't you think so 

334.16 336.04 B: i think 

336.08 341.49 B: tha- oh yes there were a lot of the frightened people there was a lot of reaction 

341.59 345.49 B: there was a lot of over reaction 

345.16 346.32 A: mhm 

346.14 348.62 B: because of my 

349.34 353.68 B: law enforcement my law enforcement background and all 

354.12 359.61 B: i had to look at it as with a kind of gallows humor kind of thing because 

359.73 362.57 B: it's either that or i go crazy and i 

363.22 366.79 B: didn't really need to go crazy that day i needed to 

366.82 369.24 B: have my wits about me 

369.38 375.17 A: well when it happened that day you know the society hill towers right on 

375.72 376.95 A: front street 

376.69 378.43 B: yeah 

377.57 378.51 A: well 

378.91 383.91 A: at first i thought they meant somebody came and said oh the towers was hit 

383.97 386.41 A: so i thought it was the towers on 

386.87 388.38 A: the you know the 

389.07 392.05 A: in society hill the society hill towers 

392.33 400.42 A: so i i was very oh i couldn't believe it and then when i heard it was new york that was even har- more hard 

400.66 403.33 A: that was more hard to believe because 

403.94 404.51 A: (( [mn] )) 

405.24 406.09 B: how 

405.45 409.48 A: that was sabotage that was like it's just unbelievable 

409.17 418.67 B: i'll i'll be honest i i guess to give you a point of reference of how old i am i'm still a fan of imas in the morning 

418.26 419.24 A: pardon 

418.86 421.30 B: i'm a fan of imas in the morning 

420.74 421.73 A: okay 

422.24 427.91 B: i was a fan way back when long ago in a galaxy far far away in high school 

427.53 428.52 A: okay 

428.04 430.85 B: (( and oh all these years later )) 

431.40 443.36 B: i remember warner wolfe calling in on it and not really believing it at first but then all of a sudden the word came into our office turn the t._v. on 

445.01 447.61 B: and i saw the first one 

447.18 448.65 A: mhm 

448.40 450.14 B: and i swallowed 

450.62 452.12 A: it's hard to believe 

451.38 454.16 B: and i said and i said 

454.18 460.50 B: mm because i'm thinking it's only an accident that nobody is actually doing this 

459.27 461.70 A: (( yeah yeah that's what i thought it's )) 

461.25 469.17 B: then i saw the second one and i said i said something i didn't need to repeat to ah to a lady 

470.32 471.92 A: hard to believe 

473.28 478.03 A: and it's so hard to believe how they're trained to commit suicide 

478.62 483.58 A: to think nothing of it just to give their lives up just that's that's so hard to believe 

484.27 487.07 A: they kill themselves those two terrorists 

487.45 490.05 B: well the whole the whole crew in 

490.71 496.42 B: in all the airplanes and such had essentially killed killed themselves 

495.88 499.39 A: oh that was sad that too with the airplanes 

499.62 506.45 A: and the people um on the airplane trying to using their cell phones trying to contact their families 

507.04 509.32 A: trying to say what's going on 

510.15 513.03 A: and and apparently they were the white house 

512.97 514.56 B: yeah 

514.75 518.44 B: but luckily those people that flight 

519.46 521.03 B: took their best shoot 

524.02 528.14 B: there was nothing there was nothing to lose 

528.36 530.64 B: i imagine at that point 

531.60 533.83 A: but he got away with it bin laden 

535.06 536.97 B: [mn] well i 

538.30 540.71 B: i don't know if you can say 

541.52 547.65 B: he got away with it because of the way now that he has to exist if he is still existing 

548.33 549.35 A: hiding 

549.50 553.15 B: yeah i mean look at it this way 

553.81 557.48 B: twenty some odd years later they find abdul hamas 

557.39 559.25 A: mhm and that's something 

558.21 559.55 B: (( and the )) 

560.43 565.64 B: sitting there in baghdad collecting his revolutionary social security checks 

567.83 568.80 B: you know 

569.73 572.72 B: [sigh] i'll be honest i 

573.03 578.42 B: that one bin laden is one whose i'd prefer to see his head on a stick 

578.52 581.41 B: to to be convinced that he's dead 

581.72 590.78 B: i don't particularly care whether saddam hussein is dead or not but that one needs to [sigh] be shown with a head on a stick 

595.02 596.34 A: [laughter] yeah 

597.48 599.88 A: [laughter] to put on and to be everyone look at it
