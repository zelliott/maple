8.16 9.94 A: okay [laughter] 

8.68 10.08 B: [laughter] um 

10.33 13.37 B: as far as changes since september eleventh 

13.40 14.41 B: um 

14.81 22.62 B: i have never i never really did any flying but i definitely didn't think about doing any more after that [laughter] 

22.01 22.94 A: okay 

23.32 34.50 A: yeah um i guess same for me i don't fly that often but it it did make me really nervous uh my spouse had to fly a few months after that and it made me nervous um 

34.12 36.35 B: did he have to fly out of country 

35.90 41.44 A: uh no just within the state and it wasn't anywhere in the area of where you know the actual 

37.86 38.91 B: oh well 

41.50 46.35 A: planes blew up or anything over new york but it still kinda made me worry about it 

46.65 60.30 B: yeah um it also made me paranoid that you know if they hit something like that you know what makes them think that they wouldn't hit schools and so you know i've considered home schooling my two year old [laughter] 

55.51 56.66 A: right 

59.63 72.35 A: uh-huh right and i i actually have a thirteen year old a nine year old and a seven year old and four and it's the same thing here it made me really nervous and just more suspicious of people [noise] 

73.66 77.80 B: an- and also you know they had so much coverage that uh 

78.18 85.27 B: i had to go buy movies for her to watch so that she didn't have to watch that but and 

82.87 84.21 A: right 

85.34 95.93 B: you know so i changed what i watched through the day because you know at first we had nine eleven then we had the war you know that had continuous coverage so 

95.28 97.85 A: right [noise] 

96.72 101.51 B: i just i have to keep it on p._b._s. or keep movies going [laughter] 

100.69 106.70 A: right and that's and it you know that's what i found too after it happened it it almost became obsession 

106.74 117.38 A: to my husband and i to watch you know the t._v. constantly of what was developing and it even happened again once the war started that you know i felt like i was just glued to seeing what was happening next 

117.70 129.60 B: i sort of think it made me more aware that i think the government at that time knew more than what they were telling us but i don't think they anticipated that happening 

117.80 119.30 A: (( and that )) 

122.38 123.24 A: [mn] 

129.15 141.70 A: right and that's how i i felt too and i felt very suspicious of the government and in my own little way i think i felt betrayed by them that you know there weren't they hadn't done more or let the public know more 

141.82 145.60 B: yeah 'cause you know the the flight in pittsburgh 

141.93 142.78 A: um 

145.52 150.14 B: exploded and you know sometimes you wonder if they didn't shoot it down 

149.95 150.98 A: right 

150.06 154.99 B: although i know that you know those passengers 

154.85 165.29 B: may have attacked him and he might of been the terrorist he might have been strapped with explosives which you know set off but you know you just don't you don't know 

162.06 163.08 A: right 

165.08 167.97 A: right [noise] you're just like you're given the whole picture and 

167.13 171.79 B: yeah i don't understand why they had some stuff but you know 

172.54 176.32 B: choose what they want to give to the public 

175.75 183.46 A: right now did you feel like you were uh did you feel like you were more patriotic as far as putting the flags out and what not after september eleventh 

183.03 184.22 B: i did 

183.82 185.94 A: yeah and i we still actually have 

186.17 197.27 A: the newspaper decal in the i think it was the chicago tribune that um you could put on your car and we still have it in our window and um we've kind of got red white and blue things outside 

197.50 200.15 B: well i we've got um 

201.29 209.53 B: car tags that someone from texas had paid for i think in all the states it says in god we trust 

208.93 209.87 A: uh-huh 

209.46 212.09 B: and so you know to me 

211.94 225.40 B: that reper- the flag is under in god we trust [laughter] and so you know we thought about getting that and uh i really need to get a new flag because it is just worn out 'cause i 

217.44 218.63 A: right 

225.24 231.46 B: fly it all the time and i don't i don't ever it's down now but i don't take it down until i need to 

231.00 232.80 A: right right 

232.73 243.76 B: and i don't just hang it up like at memorial day or july fourth or you know special occasions any more i pretty much fly it all the time 

243.16 250.80 A: yeah that that's how i've been too and i we had one on our antenna for a while but it came off and i haven't replaced it but 

250.05 251.28 B: [laughter] 

251.32 252.53 A: yeah i just 

251.35 260.64 B: well we we had like arranged where they had some that you could roll up in your window or or somehow it was in their window 

257.53 258.48 A: uh-huh 

260.66 263.72 B: and they were like on backward or for 

263.85 266.06 B: like three months 

265.41 266.64 A: right 

265.94 278.89 B: and you so you know you saw a few riding around with it but when i went to get it they said i had to be put on the waiting list [laughter] and so i'm like well maybe i'll just try and find a sticker [laughter] 

274.19 275.96 A: yeah to get it 

277.96 286.97 A: yeah so but as far as you know making me change my adjust my daily habits i didn't really change them um i did go i 

286.95 297.39 A: bought some water that we put in storage now just for i don't know i just felt like i worried about that even more so once the war started that contaminants in the water or whatever 

297.51 300.51 A: are a little bit bothersome to me 

299.99 301.32 B: yeah i 

301.83 306.72 B: i i'm kinda like you not much really changed 

306.76 312.68 B: it just make me realize that you know we're that much closer to armageddon [laughter] 

312.06 325.82 A: right and i that's how i felt too it's like you know everybody just assumes nothing would ever happen in the united states and that was a really big wake up call for everybody that that nobody's untouchable you know if somebody wants to do something it's you know 

326.08 328.75 A: there's ways of finding it to ha- make it happen 

328.64 337.06 B: that's right and you know it it kinda makes you know if i were to go to chicago and want to go in the seers tower that 

337.20 343.59 B: september eleventh would blast in my head you know [laughter] but you know i'm 

339.99 341.17 A: right 

341.21 342.29 A: (( yep )) 

344.05 353.18 B: i don't know any other thing to do except put it in god's hands and [noise] you know if it's if it's my time to go then 

353.22 358.96 B: that's what's going to happen because i can't really do anything to stop terrorists 

358.27 360.47 A: right we can't control a thing 

359.38 370.17 B: so why why should i even waste my time worrying about it 'cause that's what the- that's their i think that's their main go anyway is to scare everybody 

364.21 365.39 A: right 

369.60 372.64 A: right to get into our minds or whatever 

372.57 377.54 B: that's right [laughter] our minds our lives and everything else 

373.45 374.74 A: [laughter] 

376.85 390.49 A: right and it i think it certainly has um you know changed like at the airport and what not where my husband went through they you know did the baggage check and things like that no i i mean it seemed like an inconvenience but it's a good thing too that 

390.40 393.29 A: they're taking all the extra precautions about it 

393.30 395.15 B: i do think that 

395.17 403.46 B: i'm more cautious about you know like this sars it kind of makes you or or even like when the was 

399.43 400.36 A: uh-huh 

403.81 404.77 A: uh-huh 

403.86 408.07 B: come it it makes you wonder if they didn't 

408.09 410.95 B: cause that somehow you know like by 

411.07 418.12 B: selecting mosquitos and injecting them with something and then releasing them over here you know i i know it's bizarre but 

416.32 417.49 A: right 

417.77 419.03 A: right it 

418.22 424.50 B: i it's stuff like that just pops in my mind and so you know when one of mine gets a cold i'm like 

424.09 426.62 A: yeah you just have a suspicion of 

426.61 435.37 B: yeah and you you don't know if they're going to get into the food lines so you you i i do a lot of organic gardening 

426.78 427.74 A: what 

434.93 435.88 A: uh-huh 

436.08 442.30 B: which you know is not going to do no good if the ground gets radiation in it but 

440.45 441.60 A: right 

442.52 444.70 A: that's so you have a two year old 

444.99 449.29 B: um i have a two year old a twenty three year old and an eighteen year old 

448.36 450.43 A: oh okay [laughter] 

449.78 451.61 B: and two grandchildren 

451.31 453.97 A: okay so you started from scratch [laughter] 

453.26 460.61 B: [laughter] well my my second husband didn't have children and so that's why we had the two year old [laughter] 

456.16 457.18 A: uh-huh 

460.00 461.71 A: well that's great though 

461.54 466.22 B: yeah and i didn't really get to raise my two 

466.04 467.00 A: uh-huh 

466.42 467.55 B: so 

467.98 481.49 B: that's what you know like i said after september eleventh i was like you know i really would like to home school her because i would hate for something to happen and her not be with me you know 

481.16 483.14 A: right right 

482.12 486.50 B: it's just maybe i'm over protective but 

486.05 496.36 A: right that's i guess that were some of my precautions were more towards my children and worrying about them and even with them watching t._v. they have a um child at the elementary school that 

496.75 511.67 A: i guess is i'm not sure what it he wears the drape clothing and stuff and it even the young kids you know were suspicious towards him and i try to teach them to not be prejudiced but it's when they see all that on t._v. it's hard for them even as kids to not 

511.60 513.67 A: think things about it 

513.26 518.07 B: well shoot you have adults acting a lot worse 

517.48 519.37 A: right yeah 

519.28 527.91 B: 'cause that we i don't live that far from charlotte north carolina which they say is supposed to be the bank capital on the east coast 

527.23 528.18 A: uh-huh 

528.02 528.88 B: (( but )) 

528.36 529.16 A: (( yeah )) 

529.07 531.59 B: they they elevated 

532.07 535.40 B: the terror alert when that happened 

534.80 535.85 A: uh-huh 

535.71 540.24 B: i mean they even elevated it higher than what the national alert was 

540.08 541.01 A: uh-huh 

540.31 541.44 B: and uh 

541.90 549.60 B: it it made me 'cause you know that that's our where we shop and go out to eat a lot now 

549.22 550.24 A: uh-huh 

549.92 552.45 B: or we used to so now we 

552.74 566.82 B: start we eat closer to home and you know if we decide to take trips we we take the the two year old with us and you know we try to encourage my old- my oldest child to you know 

561.74 562.72 A: uh-huh 

566.82 569.88 B: try to do more things with the kids 

569.31 570.92 A: right [noise] 

570.05 572.73 B: 'cause you just never know what's going to happen 

572.73 574.08 A: (( yeah )) 

574.17 577.29 B: and i you know they even though they've dropped the 

577.34 585.51 B: the the status to elevated instead of you know the next to the highest i think 

583.40 584.40 A: uh-huh 

586.47 596.58 B: i think that the terrorists may be watching that because th- those people you know if you do suicide bombs you just don't you don't what to expect from them 

589.24 590.24 A: right 

596.19 599.89 A: right and that's i think that you know that was the thing
