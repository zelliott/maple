124.92 137.58 B: um and they would just make like jokes all the time i couldn't watch the t._v. i couldn't really read the you know read the newspaper read the watch the and nothing because that's how bad it affected me in terms of psychological um 

130.98 132.21 A: mhm 

136.23 137.54 A: mhm 

137.78 150.25 B: my husband works for united airlines so that didn't help yeah and so he took a yeah i mean he hasn't lost his job which is good he still has his job but i remember the like three days prior you know it was um 

139.84 140.66 A: oh 

140.90 142.78 A: oh my gosh yes 

143.95 145.15 A: yes 

146.52 147.65 A: (( [noise] oh )) 

150.24 154.61 B: every day he'd go to work and there would be a bomb threat and he'd have to evacuate 

152.97 155.32 A: that would that that'd be pretty nerve wracking 

154.86 167.20 B: yeah he had to evacuate everybody from the buildings i mean he was he's a maintenance like a maintenance person for the buildings at work at every day he would have to evacuate the buildings and make sure everybody got out and there was just total chaos 

157.07 158.05 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

160.61 162.18 A: mhm mhm 

165.47 166.31 A: mhm 

167.21 169.55 B: and then of course they went bankrupt so

170.23 174.04 A: right they were declared bankruptcy and everything but he's he's still working 

172.13 173.10 B: yeah and so 

173.56 179.30 B: yeah i mean he gotta a he gotta sizeable chunk uh a pay cut but yeah he's still working [laughter] 

174.32 175.18 A: yeah 

178.25 182.76 A: and do you think that a lot of that's probably because of nine one one a lot of people stopped flying 

182.88 194.36 B: well i remember when nine one one happened he was they were supposed to settled their contract two weeks after it was like september thirtieth they were supposed to sign everything and it was supposed to go into effect and then as soon as september eleventh happened boom 

187.15 187.96 A: mhm 

191.69 192.69 A: yeah 

194.26 200.59 B: you know they were having financial problems prior to that and that just gave 'em the okay to you know to get out or whatever 

194.95 195.74 A: yeah 

196.70 197.66 A: yeah 

198.12 198.94 A: but that 

200.23 202.09 A: that did not help any at all 

201.80 202.78 B: excuse me 

202.40 209.58 A: but that didn't help any at all when that happened now did you fly a lot before september eleventh or anything do do you fly at all 

203.51 205.43 B: no it didn't no 

206.32 207.06 B: no 

207.32 208.74 B: no [laughter] 

209.17 214.16 B: no [laughter] we do i mean i- it's funny 'cause he works for united and everybody's like and you don't fly 

209.79 210.91 A: (( yeah see )) 

212.78 213.76 A: right 

213.95 226.85 B: um i mean we we've we've f- f- when i was found out i was pregnant with my son we went to san francisco but we don't fly a lot we choose to stay at home and spend our money at home instead of flying that's how we choose to spend our money but um 

220.33 221.36 A: mhm 

223.10 223.91 A: right 

224.16 225.01 A: well 

226.28 231.61 A: for us it's expensive to fly um i i don't know if you guys get a discount or anything with him working 

228.32 229.45 B: yeah 

230.07 236.41 B: well we didn't have to pay anything 'cause there was no contract so it was free but then you still have to pay for you know the car 

232.55 234.63 A: okay yeah 

235.53 238.09 A: anywhere you go yeah yeah 

236.68 240.50 B: right so we didn't ha- we ne- we never went m- many places 

239.95 240.96 A: mhm 

240.65 243.70 B: so that didn't affect us would i have gotten on a plane no 

243.49 249.83 A: i know yeah we we never flew a lot but i would've been very leary if i had would've had to fly yeah 

244.20 245.28 B: (( [noise] no no no )) 

249.58 260.36 B: well my husband was always saying that's the best time to fly right after it happened because everything was so heightened nothing was gonna happen you know and that was the best time to fly but we never went anywhere 

254.63 255.54 A: yeah 

258.27 259.13 A: yeah 

260.59 262.80 A: you didn't make any other changes or anything 

262.46 268.65 B: uh um no not really well he said to me right after it happened it was um you know i 

264.28 265.53 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

268.41 282.22 B: would leave th- and people thought it was very strange [noise] it wasn't that i wanted to be home all the time i had to leave the house 'cause i couldn't stay in my house i was afraid to be alone 'cause my husband worked nights and it was just me and my son and we were constantly out so what kind of changes did you make

276.75 277.82 A: yeah okay 

279.85 281.07 A: yeah 

281.90 284.95 A: probably the biggest change was i watched a lot of news [laughter]
