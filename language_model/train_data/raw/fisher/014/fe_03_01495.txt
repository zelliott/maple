3.85 5.95 A: i'm in uh pennsylvania 

5.54 7.34 B: (( and i'm in west virginia [laughter] )) 

7.56 8.58 A: (( wow )) 

8.78 10.09 A: very nice 

9.88 19.98 B: um let's see what things have i done th- th- that's changed um [lipsmack] well we had plans to fly to florida and i won't get on an airplane now 

20.11 21.04 A: (( mhm [lipsmack] )) 

20.77 22.24 B: i i won't travel 

23.96 29.49 A: um i understand that [laughter] we had uh plans to travel 

25.52 26.64 B: [laughter] 

29.70 32.71 A: to italy where my husband is from in 

32.89 46.32 A: march of two thousand one and we actually did go because uh we went but i was very paranoid [laughter] but i felt safer on an international flight for whatever reason i i don't know why 

39.64 40.71 B: i i i'm 

46.40 57.26 A: i'd say the main thing that we changed was the awareness and our daily life is very different like things that mattered before 

58.23 61.30 A: don't matter anymore what we find 

61.62 68.74 A: we were already involved in our church but we went to church a lot the next two weeks because we had no idea what else to do 

69.06 70.52 A: [lipsmack] and we actually called 

70.66 73.01 A: to give blood and just couldn't find 

73.10 77.80 A: how to get there and do it because they you had to make an appointment and everything it was amazing 

77.99 83.34 B: i i i think it's changed everybody's lives i mean nothing will ever be the same as it was ever 

82.64 83.54 A: right 

84.00 88.93 B: and the the the the sense of security that we had you know this is america nothing happens here 

88.63 89.64 A: mhm 

89.16 91.37 B: and that's kinda all gone now 

91.31 93.32 A: definitely for us it was 

93.35 97.87 A: and i have a five five year old soon to be six year old who at the time was four 

97.88 107.07 A: and we had the t._v. on constantly for the first four days and he hadn't been asking anything we hadn't been telling him anything 

107.09 109.88 A: and i guess the one thing we did tell him was that 

109.98 113.85 A: uh there was a really bad accident and that's why we were going to church 

113.86 117.42 A: because a lot of people were involved but we didn't give him details 

117.46 123.23 A: and by the fourth day he started he was a mess he he just 

123.34 132.92 A: everything upset him and i started to realize that even though he's not watching the television he's absorbing it and we turned it off from then on and and really had too much 

133.27 136.13 A: too much all at once and um 

136.50 141.95 A: [lipsmack] i think it it robbed me of the security for my child which i really 

142.10 144.34 A: enjoyed having that security 

143.90 148.69 B: yeah yeah it's even scarier for children i mean it or parents who have small children 

145.82 146.70 A: yes 

148.33 149.40 A: yes 

148.79 153.60 B: i i m- my youngest if fourteen and i can't imagine having little ones [laughter] 

153.31 154.18 A: right 

154.42 159.63 A: but even for a teenager i think it would be even scarier because they understand a lot more 

158.84 170.31 B: [lipsmack] well actually [laughter] my my daughter she just kinda says okay can you tell me what happens you know she she she didn't even pay attention to it really which is sad which is sad [laughter] she lives in a cave 

166.77 168.23 A: so that's good 

168.47 169.87 A: [laughter] 

170.37 181.89 B: well i i um i don't know i [mn] the whole thing has just affected affected me personally because i used to live in a cave and now i watch the news at least once a day 

170.40 171.45 A: (( great )) 

176.91 177.72 A: uh-huh 

181.57 182.61 A: mhm 

182.17 187.62 B: um if i don't my husband tells me you know what what he's read or what he's heard and 

186.35 187.27 A: mhm 

187.74 192.92 B: um i think i've taken dramatic steps that otherwise i probably wouldn't have um 

191.94 192.80 A: yeah 

193.03 198.65 B: we've began we've began uh a program of storing food in case there's an emergency 

198.44 199.64 A: oh okay 

198.88 200.00 B: um 

200.15 207.26 B: i actually ordered a radiation uh it's potassium iodide it's it's what the military gives um 

204.64 205.53 A: uh-huh 

207.31 212.47 B: or or people in the vicinity of nuclear plants in case there is something like that 

210.00 210.92 A: mhm 

211.98 213.61 A: we actually had um 

213.64 218.62 A: because we live within a certain within ten miles of a of a nuclear plant 

218.21 223.65 B: now see that that would scare me that right there would scare the j- beebees outta me i would just be gone 

220.12 221.97 A: that was very scary 

222.61 235.18 A: they actually didn't uh it was scary after it happened because there was a lot of planes circling the power plant and of course the fir- [mn] now when i see a plane in the sky that's the most thing 

235.26 240.34 A: probably it scares me it never used to scare me before and now i see a plane and i think why is it there 

240.59 242.71 A: and it looks awful low [laughter] 

242.12 243.01 B: yeah 

242.98 246.19 A: but we had um fighter jets around the plant 

246.58 251.57 A: for [lipsmack] i think the first week if not a little bit longer and that was very scary 

251.20 261.07 B: [cough] i i think what scares me the most as far as fear is that um i my husband and i have done some really heavy duty researching in the into september eleventh 

260.67 261.59 A: mhm 

261.20 262.79 B: and um 

262.94 272.93 B: i i i i don't buy everything that's that's that's being written i just don't buy it there's too many oddities and i honestly think that our government has had a hand in it 

272.84 273.80 A: mhm 

273.12 283.60 B: [lipsmack] i really do i mean there there's there's too many things that's that's what scares me i mean you know if foreigners came here and did it because they hate us or whatever that's scary enough 

283.25 284.12 A: right 

283.50 293.61 B: but to think that our government could have could have some kind of a cover up i mean it doesn't make any sense to me just different things like uh out of all the different airports that all these planes came from 

293.48 299.39 B: they cannot provide one picture of any of these terrorists in any of the airports with all those security cameras 

299.08 300.25 A: right 

300.32 302.92 B: i mean that that doesn't make any sense to me 

300.43 301.55 A: that's true 

302.80 303.84 A: (( right mhm )) 

303.25 308.38 B: and and you know they wanted an independent investigation uh of of what was going on and [mn] 

308.47 313.19 B: i i just i i don't know you know it never did come about i just i just don't understand 

314.12 315.21 B: so tha- 

314.15 316.45 A: i think one thing that upset me a lot 

316.48 322.48 A: was the community that the whole nation was on september twelfth went away really quickly 

322.63 328.24 A: and i just keep praying that i'll never forget how i felt on september eleventh 

328.25 329.38 A: because 

329.64 335.28 A: i'm a friendly person but it seems out in public you know other people aren't 

335.18 345.64 A: and that first two weeks you know we were all saying hi to everybody and how are you and meant it and that i think by christmas was gone and that was really sad 

345.48 346.33 B: yeah 

346.59 353.61 A: i mean it shouldn't take a tragedy like that to have people act that way but i think it should've been that way anyway 

353.01 366.05 B: i agree i agree i i uh my brother doesn't live even ten miles from me and you know we we might talk twice a year and it's you know and since that happened i you know i make frequent calls i i see how he's doing i go up and see him 

365.56 366.82 A: well that's great 

366.19 370.64 B: um i don't know i think i think it kind of changes your perspective on what's important 

370.23 375.52 A: it really did it really did i thought i knew what was important but um 

375.61 379.90 A: i i had it half wrong i would say and now 

380.13 386.43 A: it the only thing that is important what i make my priority is how will this affect the family and is this good for the family 

386.49 387.39 A: and 

386.52 390.55 B: and it and and with younger children too it makes you wonder just what kind of future do they have 

390.78 393.02 A: it very much makes me wonder that 

392.22 404.66 B: yeah yeah we're adults you know w- we've spent most of our lives at least half of it already but but they have their whole lives ahead of them and if it's this bad now i mean what are we gonna do for them to make it better 

396.63 397.62 A: mhm 

404.62 405.59 A: yeah 

405.20 416.68 B: i mean th- you you know what i'm saying our children should have the freedoms that we had they shouldn't have to go out and and and worry about playing playing in the yard and you know worrying about you know if some g- if somebody's gonna hit the nuclear plant 

416.35 417.70 A: right right 

417.16 420.01 B: [laughter] that that's just it's outrageous [cough] 

419.51 434.18 A: and that's another thing that came up a lot after september eleventh with more security in certain places and how people were saying that infringes on our rights and i just don't see it that way i feel safe knowing that there's going to be security checks and 

434.15 443.77 A: i- if you're not [sigh] i i don't understand if you're not willing to go through a little bit you know you can't have freedom and everything you want i- i- it's it's just impossible to have it all 

443.47 444.27 B: yeah 

443.84 454.77 A: and we n- if we need i don't consider it giving up my rights you know i i really don't we went to the circus last night and had metal detectors and i was thankful and 

454.74 460.05 A: i i it didn't take much longer it took probably five extra minutes than it would if they didn't have them 

460.13 465.71 A: and it just made me feel safe and i w- [sigh] i i don't understand the people who feel that 

465.99 470.33 A: it's infringing on their rights because i don't see it that way i really don't 

469.18 471.85 B: i i i have to agree with that i i do 

471.80 478.78 B: um well i g- i should say i agree with that to a point um there there are certain things that they're trying to put into the security act 

474.45 475.23 A: right 

478.71 491.96 B: uh since september eleventh i even forget the name of it now my husband knows but um you know i- where they're trying to make uh certain vaccines mandatory and the vaccines could actually be more dan- they c- i mean especially for small children 

480.03 480.75 A: mhm 

487.13 488.36 A: (( [lipsmack] yes )) 

490.06 493.63 A: yes that is very scary that is very scary 

492.96 503.00 B: the the these these [lipsmack] these mandatory vaccines that they could impose on us um sh- a- and not only that but this um [lipsmack] um the the security level 

503.23 506.00 B: i read the other day that if it goes to high 

506.06 515.27 B: that well basically um you can't leave your home if your children are in school they will be escorted to an undisclosed location and you cannot go pick up your children 

514.88 516.78 A: but we i thought we were on high 

516.81 518.37 A: t- a week ago 

516.98 519.82 B: the the one above that the one the highest one 

519.43 521.00 A: oh oh oh okay 

520.45 525.18 B: the highest one if if it goes to that you are not allowed to leave your home 

525.63 535.11 B: and you cannot go to the school and pick up your children that makes me mad i wrote i don't know how many letters because i mean yes it's affecting everybody's lives but you know some of it's just pure craziness 

534.94 540.06 A: and we can't be away from our children [laughter] in a situation like that 

537.51 550.79 B: no well you might you might wanna check it because it's all over the internet if you go and read about it it's in the newspapers um several small town schools have called into like radio stations and sent copies of the of what the school has sent them um 

543.49 544.50 A: mhm 

549.58 561.96 A: mhm the school has said something to that extent they've sent home if there is ever an emergency which we always figured this came from the power plant since we live ten miles from the power plant we have things like that 

561.97 575.60 A: and it said if there is an emergency your child will be going to this location and uh you are not to come to the school to pick them up you can meet them at that location or you know something like that and i just felt powerless as a mother 

575.17 587.44 B: yeah you mi- you might wanna read it real close because a lot of 'em are saying that um y- you're not allowed to pick 'em up and that they're not gonna disclose the location until you know the the level of threat has has dropped again 

587.10 588.12 A: right 

587.53 599.89 B: and um you know that that to me is is that to me is an infringement of my rights using a metal detector no that does not bother me because i'd rather have a sense of security that's for real than to have a false sense 

592.49 593.46 A: (( yes ))
