4.59 10.22 A: jessica i had bad connection could you tell me what the topic was 

9.93 15.91 B: yep they said um what changes have you made in your life personally since september eleventh 

15.81 18.83 A: okay well you can take off if you care 

18.46 19.90 B: [laughter] 

20.33 22.01 B: well for me 

22.03 28.31 B: i don't think i've made any changes in my life it just makes you appreciate everything a little more i think 

27.97 29.20 A: uh-huh 

30.13 31.10 B: (( i don't know )) 

30.15 32.52 A: so so you haven't made any 

32.70 37.93 A: big future changes or any actually lifechi- lifestyle changes huh 

37.39 39.99 B: not really i mean um 

40.57 43.62 B: right when that happened i remember we were trying to have a baby 

43.27 44.72 A: oh 

43.99 49.08 B: and you know that's a pretty big decision and that didn't change anything for us 

48.65 49.73 A: yeah 

49.12 53.42 B: you know it made me think twice that you know in the end we decided

62.11 63.49 B: [laughter] 

63.15 67.10 A: no i'm glad you did because i mean i'm i'm i can't say that i'm 

67.39 79.04 A: dealing with any lifestyle situations like what you've just expressed but ah honestly i believe that's the best thing we can do we just go on and live life i mean because when we turn 

79.24 88.46 A: to where we go hide in our closets or hide in our corners of our dwellings our homes our businesses and we're looking around and sheepish 

88.82 90.63 A: ah sheeps 

90.72 98.94 A: i mean sheep tend to be herded and hunted and you know if you present yourself as that that's what everybody will take you as 

98.83 107.58 A: and i couldn't i couldn't stand the idea that this country because of something as horrendous as that happening would end up going from being 

107.98 118.89 A: america to america the coward or you know i mean it just it really bothered me and i've heard so many people go well what if well what if and i'm like well what if 

118.91 123.75 A: yeah well if if we don't do anything if we 

124.30 131.51 A: let them win in a psychological battle it's gonna make it a whole lot easier in all other aspects of the world 

127.14 128.04 B: mhm 

131.47 133.06 B: yep i agree with you 

132.96 133.82 A: yeah 

133.05 146.49 B: you know because i remember right after it happened you know i'd think about going to a concert or going to anywhere there's a lot of people and i said oh my gosh you know should i go should i not and i'm like you know what i can't let this change my life 

135.58 136.49 A: mhm 

138.12 138.86 A: (( mm )) 

145.95 147.22 A: (( that's right )) 

146.59 147.67 B: and 

147.91 148.70 B: so 

149.02 156.22 B: i try not to dwell on it and it's something awful and something we should learn from and always remember but 

156.28 159.07 B: i'm trying not to let it change my life [laughter] 

158.61 173.23 A: well it hadn't it hadn't even um knowing the repercussions of like this war and everything else is really kind of coming from that it hasn't changed the the way you all are setting up your financial futures or anything 

173.91 174.94 B: um 

175.41 176.70 B: (( not really )) 

176.42 177.99 A: well that's good 

177.39 178.39 B: i mean 

178.15 180.70 A: that's good that's really good 

180.38 192.74 B: you know i think i've actually had this discussion with my parents a couple of times about you know the war in iraq and everything my mom's saying you know that's so awful and i can't believe we're doing this and i'm going but you know what 

187.11 188.09 A: mhm 

193.17 196.31 B: you want to sit back and just let something else happen 

196.88 204.96 B: i said you know there's a lot more people making these decisions than me and you and they have a lot more information than they let out to the public anyway so 

204.20 205.13 A: (( uh-huh )) 

205.12 205.87 B: (( i'm like )) 

205.92 208.02 B: i don't think they take it lightly so 

208.31 211.32 A: see that's the thing about it besides nine eleven 

211.77 217.04 A: it well think back to the world trade center but ah basically 

217.64 220.15 A: there are very few wars 

220.26 221.63 A: besides 

222.08 226.85 A: the war between the states and the war for our independence has been fought on our soil 

227.10 229.96 A: and when we start letting them bring it to us 

229.55 230.38 B: (( mm )) 

230.67 232.32 A: i mean you can say 

232.33 237.70 A: you know for all of the nay sayers that go oh we shouldn't be over there we shouldn't do this we shouldn't do that 

237.79 244.43 A: say okay well look i got an idea let's call them up and we'll tell them we're gonna start the war in your back yard tomorrow 

243.86 245.38 B: [laughter] 

244.67 255.28 A: and we'll all meet in your back yard you're ready for that aren't you you want to be a nay sayer you don't want anybody to do anything but i bet you don't want it to start in your back yard 

254.54 255.66 B: yep 

255.19 257.46 A: and very very few 

257.22 271.10 A: do i believe would actually go well i could talk them in i could change their mind and say well okay if you could change their mind i bet there's a plane heading over there why don't you go over there and stop the war for us because that'll save everybody 

261.93 263.07 B: [laughter] 

271.08 279.34 A: and the results that you claim that you really want would happen and i don't mind i'll help pay for your plane ticket 

278.79 280.17 B: [laughter] 

279.63 283.37 A: i mean you know does it not make a little bit of sense 

282.76 284.39 B: oh i agree 

284.12 285.19 A: (( you know )) 

284.73 288.23 B: and what drives me crazy are the protesters and stuff and then 

288.37 289.37 A: yeah 

288.50 290.41 B: i mean i can't say i 

290.53 293.96 B: i'm happy that we went to war i mean people die it's 

293.59 294.53 A: yep 

294.03 296.63 B: just a fact and it's horrible but 

296.68 298.87 B: it needs to be done you know 

297.93 299.35 A: (( yep )) 

299.19 302.65 B: and thank god for people in the military that's all i have to say 

302.35 309.41 A: yep yep it's it's a tough job and it was tough for people to make the decisions but um 

309.53 312.16 A: i'm glad to see that the men and women 

312.33 326.15 A: didn't you know did nothing and say well we wanted the good out of military we didn't plan on this look when this is over you all let us know and we'll serve what time in jail we need to we'll talk to you later bye 

325.50 326.81 B: [laughter] 

326.41 328.80 A: you know i mean that's just not the way it is 

328.99 334.96 A: i know i missed out on pulling in the service because my brother was a vietnam vet and he told me he said look buck 

335.05 338.40 A: the way it is is the way it is when i was over there 

338.41 343.00 A: if you volunteered it was you were approached in one situation and if you 

343.07 350.33 A: were drafted it was something else so when my age was rolling around the draft was just stopping 

345.33 346.10 B: mm 

350.42 357.35 A: so i ended up missing military and i think it's one of the biggest mistakes in my life but because of that tragedy 

357.95 366.24 A: and and it makes me feel so much better about what they're doing nowadays because nowadays instead of well i'm i'm gonna sit on my hands 

366.22 372.97 A: and if you tell me it's all right i'm gonna pull my fingers out one at a time and but you gonna control this we're not gonna 

373.04 379.29 A: the military's really not gonna tell me what to do i'm going to let government politics and all this this time 

379.36 381.20 A: they're doing it a lot different 

381.48 388.05 A: and i believe because of nine eleven it it that's the reason why they shook it up and they did everything like they did 

387.46 388.43 B: mhm 

389.10 394.31 A: i'm glad the economy hasn't gone into a t- total tailspin from it but um 

395.13 398.47 A: we have yet to see what's going to happen about that 

397.60 404.43 B: i know actually i have noticed that an all round view i'm in massachusetts that the gas prices are actually starting to go back down 

404.16 412.28 A: oh yeah ours are too um i'm in north carolina and ours the cheapest we got around are in the one thirties 

411.75 413.68 B: oh oh my gosh really 

413.32 414.59 A: yeah 

413.97 415.75 B: we're in the one sixties 

415.43 424.89 A: well hey you know you're getting there we'll see i mean that's just like when we were in the one forties i could see on the news where they were talking about in california they were in the two eighties 

416.13 417.43 B: that's the cheapest 

424.26 434.44 B: oh i know i remember i was watching the today show or something this woman had an s._u._v. and [laughter] she was pumping it was like sixty dollars or something and i said wow 

425.73 426.90 A: (( that was like )) 

430.81 432.59 A: [laughter] 

434.04 437.04 A: yeah yeah she only probably got a quarter of a tank 

436.07 439.36 B: yeah she didn't have a heck of a lot but 

438.78 444.50 A: yeah and i i believe it's all a direct result of that nine eleven but um 

444.79 454.08 A: as bad as that was i mean i just i don't know it shook me i was at work and i told i told the guys at work i said guys 

454.09 461.61 A: i said bush had to do something to save his stuff what'd he do he ended up getting some nuts to fly a plane into a building for us 

462.11 466.00 A: and the next thing i know it's it's all this kind of turmoil 

465.80 478.73 A: 'cause they said that the nuts that did it the their head people they wanted to shake us up wanted to damage damage our economy but they never thought the whole thing would fall like that 

478.07 479.00 B: (( mm )) 

478.58 482.07 A: 'cause they knew after that happened they'd be like 

482.13 495.37 A: ah ha ha we're gonna be funny we're gonna go light a paper bag full of ah tissue in front of somebody's door it's halloween and they're gonna run out and stomp it out ah ha ha ha so we go do that and then the house catches on fire and burns down 

495.16 500.97 B: mm i know that was the worst case i'm sure i don't think they were planning that that would happen 

495.91 497.23 A: but you never 

498.49 499.48 A: yeah 

500.13 508.55 A: yeah because i mean if they would they would of i believe they would of only hit americans because they had so many japanese 

508.34 522.38 A: and so many other nationalities represented by that that was an ac- an action that could nothing do nothing but be like pulling the very bottom card out of a house of cards it's gonna fall down on top of you 

523.24 523.86 A: (( whew )) 

524.28 529.48 B: mm i remember i was on vacation that was the last vacation i took [laughter]

540.18 541.39 A: yeah 

540.78 542.50 B: that was just horrible 

542.23 543.50 A: oh yeah 

542.94 547.42 B: and i remember saying to my husband i'm like oh my god do you know how many people are going to die
