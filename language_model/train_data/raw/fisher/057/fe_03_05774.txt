42.21 54.78 B: group of people that would go to church and everyone would get together for holidays and i'm i'm sure there's still families like that now but i feel like cousins are important and aren't as important to most families anymore 

54.61 59.82 B: and just that the divorce has caused family just to become dissolved 

59.69 66.88 A: yeah i'm from brooklyn new york city and um i'd say about sixty percent of the um families

105.09 117.66 B: i mean there's so many alimony payments and child support payments and it it's it's ending up being more of a a bitter topic i suppose to what it's supposed to be where two people are happily married 

117.21 120.99 A: [mn] yeah two people can be happily married just on paper in my opinion 

121.00 131.96 A: ah that's why i'm still single and thirty seven and still you know haven't made up my mind about getting married or i eventually will get married but you know i'd like to get married before forty 

131.68 140.22 B: (( right [noise] right )) 

132.38 140.82 A: and and so so should well she will want to get married too you know before she's thirty five to produce kids without deformities 

141.14 146.38 B: right ah i mean i'm i'm twenty five years old and i've been dating a girl for 

146.24 157.94 B: two years and she puts a little bit of pressure on me in terms of you know wanting to see some sort of a commitment or a ring but i'm just not sure if i'm ready for that quite yet 

158.26 161.87 A: don't worry about it i've been with her seventeen years [laughter] 

161.12 162.84 B: (( seventeen years )) 

162.49 171.13 A: yeah seventeen years but you know we went onto ah well ah she went onto graduate school so it took a toll on her and um 

171.33 182.47 A: ah i just went to ah regular um to get my baccalaureates and just been fiddling around jumping from job to job every five years so i really didn't have anything steady worthwhile to ah 

182.51 186.50 A: create a family and especially in ah brooklyn well you know you live in manhattan 

186.49 198.24 A: um houses start at three hundred thousand dollars a year i mean three hundred thousand i mean you must be have to must be making at least seventy five to a hundred thousand dollars in my opinion to pay off a mortgage 

190.42 191.45 B: right 

196.47 199.88 B: just to afford the down payment and the mortgage and 

199.16 203.70 A: [mn] yeah it's gonna be if you you you want twenty years a twenty mortgage 

203.70 204.98 B: right 

204.32 210.99 A: that's what i that's what look at try to look at but still it's a big issue and plus there's a lot of guys that i know 

211.02 218.66 A: that got fools you know they got married five years later the lady's a crack head took all their money and that was the end of that 

218.04 225.55 B: right oh i mean it's crazy but how how have you noticed has your family stayed pretty close together over the years or 

225.19 227.81 A: yeah we were um ah 

227.93 238.80 A: we went to um church together we went to ah grammar school ah we went to ah catholic highschool so ah plus she lived in the neighbourhood 

238.71 239.94 B: right 

239.32 241.13 A: so we knew each other 

241.14 243.40 A: [mn] and other than that um 

243.53 245.21 A: that's how we just know each other 

244.89 259.13 B: well i feel like neighborhoods have changed dramatically since you were growing up and i was growing up they used to be a lot more close knit where you'd let your kids go round and play in the next yard and i feel like people build up barriers and fences a lot more 

258.50 269.34 A: yeah well i grew up in a a in a italo um irish jewish neighborhood where everybody knew each other everybody intermingled and that's how we got married you know 

269.26 277.84 A: it wasn't that people went out to the suburbs and met somebody on long island that was a rarity you usually married a girl from around the corner or a or a couple of blocks away 

273.75 274.61 B: right 

277.62 282.33 B: whose family knew her family for a long time and exactly 

281.20 283.26 A: yeah that kind of stuff yeah 

282.61 289.02 B: yeah have ah have any of your ah siblings gotten married or gotten divorced or 

288.44 297.33 A: no i'm the oldest in the family and nobody else has um gotten married [mn] it's it's also the trend around my neighborhood though people that didn't get married um 

297.61 302.34 A: before they were twenty five are just lingering on into their um mid thirties 

302.06 304.26 B: yo without getting married 

303.99 312.42 A: yeah without getting married you know people are like making a commitment is also a ah a a monetary commitment too you know 

312.43 314.36 A: 'cause they see what happened when 

314.42 317.81 A: other people that had um 

318.20 326.22 A: children and the children didn't have a father around a lot of them fell between the um tracks or fell on the other side of the tracks 

326.13 327.13 B: right 

326.29 329.47 A: you know became drug addicts or whatever the hell it may be 

329.54 332.53 B: well see my father's been married to my mom for 

332.34 336.24 B: thirty five years and everyone else that he grew up working with 

336.04 349.10 B: thinks that's crazy 'cause they've all you know gotten divorced twice or been married three times or something and no one like i just feel like marriage and i don't know if you've heard that term in new york like the starter marriage 

348.85 350.14 A: yeah yeah 

349.32 353.73 B: i find the starter marriage is a crazy concept i i think it's ridiculous 

353.90 359.52 B: if someone wants to get married to someone for like two years just to 'cause it'll be fun or something i don't know 

360.20 365.71 A: that's what a lot of my friends did because they went to um graduate school or they were in the service 

365.53 379.13 A: they got married for a stint like for two years or something like that but they don't realize though um your first marriage i think all the social security benefits go to the um first wife 

379.38 381.11 A: did you hear about that 

379.47 380.43 B: really 

380.51 382.36 B: no never heard that 

381.81 385.30 A: (( you know unless the unless both parties get remarried again )) 

385.54 387.27 A: so if you want to 

385.89 390.26 B: so so the so the guy's social security benefits would go to the first wife 

389.88 394.84 A: yeah that's what i heard and i was like no that's gotta be that's gotta be crazy but that's what i heard 

393.17 393.94 B: (( yeah )) 

394.34 396.01 B: that's crazy 

395.43 399.27 A: yeah it could be it could be true though you never know you know how the situation works 

398.79 401.87 B: (( yeah i mean i gotta research that before i get married though )) 

401.77 416.45 A: and here's ano- and here's another one i used to work with these guys who are kinda lowlifes and i think um the the maximum amount of your salary for a child payment could be seventeen percent so they figure if they go on to marry another wife 

416.40 429.11 A: and then another wife and have more and more kids it's divided by the seventeen percent divided by the number of um women you have so you're screwing that bitch by um giving her less money 

424.77 425.37 B: (( [mn] )) 

428.82 430.53 B: right [laughter] 

429.06 432.82 A: but then she's playing the game too by going around and marrying the other guys 

432.54 435.29 B: trying to get some of the seventeen percent 

434.71 437.11 A: yeah trying to get the some of the seventeen percent 

435.97 439.72 B: that's crazy like i i don't think that used to happen 

437.19 437.87 A: (( yeah )) 

439.86 452.65 B: i i think like maybe some of it had to do with the fact that women had not equality in the marriage and they weren't allowed or weren't able to work and earn good pay but i think just things have changed so much recently 

452.79 456.11 A: [mn] yeah but this is ah the ghetto mentality 

456.15 463.15 A: that ah i'm talking mostly about but still it has it has bled over into regular working class and now 

462.24 466.51 B: i think a lot of the women who are trying to marry for money i mean 

466.47 477.30 B: i don't i feel like new york all the time is one reason i'm happy to be dating the girl i am is i feel like every woman is just strictly sizing up you for your bank account and how much they can take from you 

477.28 482.66 A: that's exactly what i see too but that's why i'm sticking with the one i know from seventeen years 

482.10 486.33 B: right because i mean she has a track record and you know she's not around just for the money 

486.10 487.52 A: yeah that's correct 

487.41 490.78 B: i mean it's the same thing with me so so i like it 

487.58 488.45 A: and 

490.69 505.65 A: yeah but you go into manhattan though like the clubs in brooklyn are a little bit less um less appealing but the women know what they're up against you know like the top the top salary maker's probably a cop or something like that as opposed to manhattan they're just gold digging 

505.08 513.39 B: right so what do you do well i'm an investment banker and all of a sudden their eyes light up or you say i'm a teacher and they run off they'd run away or something 

509.46 511.14 A: yeah something like that 

512.76 515.35 A: yeah yeah yeah that's exactly it 

514.88 517.10 B: it's stupid it's ridiculous 

515.70 516.50 A: [laughter] 

516.98 528.21 A: yeah but like she's stuck with me for these last six months 'cause i was laid off and i got my job back you know she had the opportunity to round out and go for somebody else but no she's been supporting me so that's pretty cool i like that 

527.61 533.88 B: yeah i mean that shows you a lot about someone's character and intentions when when you go through a bad period and they're with you 

533.84 535.33 A: yeah exactly 

534.37 538.78 B: that's kind that's kind of what happened to me a coupla months ago 'cause i was living 

538.88 547.05 B: like just bumming around and i came back and i it took me like two months to get a job but she stuck with me as opposed to all these lawyers that hit on her every day 

547.23 552.18 B: and so that tells me something there you know she likes me more than just for what i might amount to 

552.68 557.56 A: i hear ya yeah i hear that you know my girlfriend's a lawyer too but um 

552.69 554.31 B: so i like that 

557.86 570.96 A: ah with with her is that she came out of school with nothing because she had like close to three hundred thousand dollars in debt but i was like sorta supporting her you know giving her a free place to ah live 

566.10 567.10 B: right 

571.01 572.16 A: with me 

572.11 578.81 B: right that's good i mean the amount of debt you come out with after school is crazy 

578.30 583.20 A: yeah because um ah what is it ah lawyers can't deduct their ah 

583.81 592.76 A: their um [mn] tuition yeah everybody else can you know but for graduate school they can but not lawyers it's some silly law because 

584.68 586.05 B: their tuition 

592.05 595.79 B: i guess it's probably 'cause your income gets so big 

595.70 597.55 A: ah no because um 

597.77 599.62 A: (( usually when you have like a deg- ah ))
