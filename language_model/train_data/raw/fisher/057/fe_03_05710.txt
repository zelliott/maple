0.00 1.00 B: hello 

0.20 2.66 A: [lipsmack] hi my name's eric [lipsmack] 

2.32 4.46 B: hi my name's gregory [mn] [mn] 

3.89 4.85 A: hi 

5.06 8.67 A: [lipsmack] so we're supposed to talk about foreign relations 

8.08 9.37 B: yes 

8.88 13.72 A: and if we believe there are countries that pose a threat to u._s. s- security 

13.14 15.04 B: (( [noise] correct [noise] [mn] [mn] )) 

15.43 16.76 A: (( [lipsmack] s- so )) 

16.80 19.78 A: i'll start with the obvious one i think um 

20.18 23.36 A: north korea poses a threat to our security 

22.61 24.61 B: (( [mn] definitely [mn] [mn] [mn] [mn] [mn] )) 

24.55 26.28 A: i don't 

26.30 35.45 A: k- know that i think we've held off on it because it's going to require a much more nuanced approach than [noise] we used in iraq [lipsmack] 

34.92 37.12 B: (( uh-hum [lipsmack] i agree [mn] [mn] [mn] [mn] [mn] [mn] )) 

38.79 41.51 A: and i think it will actually require [noise] 

41.95 51.90 A: coordination with our allies i mean i think if we want peaceful resolution we'll need to persuade c- china that they should intervene and 

52.23 53.68 B: definitely 

53.52 55.57 A: help us diplomatically 

55.31 56.61 B: definitely 

57.40 65.65 B: [mn] um i actually [noise] [sigh] i agree with you [noise] [sigh] north korea i think unfortunately [noise] [sigh] has really been ignored [sigh] 

65.84 68.36 B: they're a larger t- threat i think than even 

68.63 73.75 B: [lipsmack] iraq because i mean these it's like when you [mn] [sigh] [mn] [mn] [mn] [mn] 

69.39 71.14 A: [sigh] [lipsmack] i think so too 

72.22 80.69 A: iraq was just the accidental association of september eleventh and the fact that it was an arab country that made it seem more urgent [noise] [noise] 

78.65 80.30 B: (( y- yeah [sigh] )) 

80.12 86.73 B: and unfortunately i [sigh] i i i really want to want to question now whether it was an [sigh] actually accidental 

86.53 88.96 B: um i i [mn] actually tend to believe that [sigh] 

88.78 102.21 B: people might have had other motives [sigh] but in terms of north korea [sigh] [mn] it's like backing a cat into a corner [sigh] they don't have food [sigh] the people are starving [mn] [sigh] that's a scary situation the r- regime's on its last legs [mn] 

96.86 97.79 A: (( uh-huh uh-hum )) 

102.51 110.08 B: um literally they have [noise] nothing to lose [sigh] and and since they're so isolated [sigh] you really don't know what's going on 

104.89 106.09 A: exactly 

110.11 113.80 B: [sigh] that that's what really concerns me [sigh] also [mn] 

112.43 116.22 A: ri- and there's no media going in or out of the country [noise] right 

115.66 122.68 B: thank you what also concerns me is [sigh] believe it or not i'm sort of concerned about saudi arabia [noise] um [lipsmack] 

123.08 126.85 B: [sigh] yeah they're an ally but when you have so many 

127.26 140.63 B: um people with extremist views [sigh] [mn] coming out of a particular country and they seem to have [sigh] no control on what what in god's name's going on um [lipsmack] [sigh] i'm actually concerned about that i think um [sigh] 

131.32 132.11 A: right 

135.20 136.07 A: (( [lipsmack] right )) 

140.67 147.94 B: that's one country that needs to have some p- pressure applied to them to [sigh] sort of [noise] get their act together because ah [mn] 

148.62 156.61 B: y- you know it's it's not a very [sigh] good situation i a- and personally [sigh] the two countries that we went into [sigh] well [noise] [sigh] 

156.57 158.43 B: i i just feel like um 

158.36 171.87 B: [noise] [mn] there wasn't e- enough preparation [noise] especially for iraq [noise] i mean [noise] [sigh] [noise] we're going to be in iraq [sigh] we're going to be in iraq probably as long as we were in japan [sigh] and we we still have troops stationed in japan 

167.97 168.82 A: (( uh-hum )) 

172.75 176.72 B: [mn] i don't right now i i don't even think [noise] we have enough troops in 

176.68 187.41 B: [noise] iraq [noise] every single day somebody dies [noise] if [noise] not every day every other day [noise] [sigh] and i'm saying that w- war has some cost but [sigh] you know 

180.85 181.77 A: (( uh-hum yeah )) 

187.37 197.25 B: p- poor planning [noise] has made this a bit [noise] a cost that's a little too hi- too h- high to bear [sigh] [noise] um [noise] 

194.69 204.19 A: [lipsmack] [sigh] yeah i don't know if it's poor planning or if it's just lack i don't even know if we h- have a plan for iraq [laughter] n- never mind whether it's a [laughter] p- poor one 

199.68 200.38 B: (( [noise] )) 

201.44 211.56 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] no i agree with you [noise] it it's ridiculous [noise] [noise] and these guys are [noise] between [noise] eighteen and twenty two [noise] [noise] oh 

205.69 206.77 A: (( [laughter] uh-hum uh-hum [noise] )) 

210.72 211.60 A: (( uh-hum )) 

211.63 222.43 B: my god [noise] haven't even men and women i should say [noise] haven't even begun to live [noise] [noise] and then [noise] [mn] the economy's in such a poor state [noise] [sigh] what's going to happen when these people return 

222.65 229.49 B: (( [noise] you know well [sigh] [noise] i should say [noise] well actually i don't believe many of them will return [sigh] these people are going to be in iraq for a long time [noise] [noise] )) 

229.65 230.47 B: [mn] 

231.12 234.73 A: [lipsmack] yeah some of t- them at least c- certainly will be [noise] uh-hum 

234.85 240.32 B: and i i actually think that um [noise] [sigh] this may cause us to institute a draft [noise] 

240.70 250.31 B: whether people agree with it or not [sigh] we're going to i- institute some sort of draft i i think [noise] 'cause ah got to keep [sigh] got to keep the troops strength up [noise] and um 

251.50 254.52 B: [noise] [sigh] i don't know some of our relations with some of these [noise] 

254.54 256.72 B: [mn] middle eastern countries [sigh] 

257.26 260.48 B: have to be reexamined i mean [sigh] [noise] s- syria 

261.11 262.40 B: and even ah [sigh] 

263.27 268.59 B: [noise] what [sigh] the whole issue with syria israel and these other countries [sigh] that has to be reexamined 

269.01 271.04 B: i i just feel like um 

273.26 283.38 B: [noise] israel's sort of been given a free reign to do what they want [sigh] but the problem is that [sigh] [noise] when they do things it sort of comes back twenty fold [noise] 

282.99 284.45 A: (( uh-hum [noise] right )) 

284.05 285.94 B: [sigh] um so i mean 

284.99 292.18 A: and it doesn't just affect them either it comes back twenty fold against them and all their p- perceived allies 

288.12 289.44 B: yes see [noise] 

290.99 296.71 B: [noise] exactly and so much of what's going on is [sigh] perception i mean 

297.43 303.11 B: thank god they have a cease fire but shit [sigh] how long has it taken to get cease fire [noise] i mean 

301.30 302.42 A: (( uh-hum uh-hum [noise] )) 

303.21 310.39 B: they are people who [noise] went from elementary school all the way to college and graduate school [sigh] and these people are still fighting 

309.20 310.47 A: (( [mn] right )) 

310.84 312.08 B: so um 

312.36 315.25 B: i i i'm afraid that um 

315.97 320.38 B: we've got a lot more work to do than we believe 

320.56 321.69 B: and ah 

323.02 325.63 B: you know i don't know what's going on with russia either [sigh] 

324.98 325.93 A: (( [sigh] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

325.86 329.74 B: i mean [noise] the country's sort of all over the place 

330.70 332.58 B: you know um [sigh] 

333.17 335.78 B: i've got i don't see them as an enemy but i mean 

336.52 339.86 B: [noise] in some ways it was better when they were one sh- 

339.06 339.63 A: (( [noise] )) 

340.61 353.51 B: because at least you had control over what was going on now you have r- rogue elements all over the place [sigh] and the country was massed you had nuclear weapons here nuclear weapons there i mean things could fall in the wrong people's hands 

342.59 344.16 A: you knew what was happening 

345.38 346.47 A: (( sure uh-hum )) 

356.23 358.97 B: (( [noise] [noise] u- um [noise] )) 

361.07 365.95 A: well i'm not real comfortable with india and pakistan having nuclear [laughter] w- weapons either 

364.88 365.52 B: (( [noise] a- )) 

366.08 367.38 B: ah 

367.47 370.65 B: that that's another thing i mean [sigh] 

371.11 381.38 B: you know india's not the richest country on the planet and they nu- they have clear weapons and so does pakistan [sigh] and these people get into these sort of um 

382.29 392.84 B: i don't know what you call 'em dick measuring contests you know and t- these people could damn near blow up half half their territory i mean they've come really close to war [noise] o- 

384.74 386.17 A: (( uh-hum uh-hum )) 

390.29 391.22 A: (( [sigh] right )) 

392.68 394.28 A: yeah they have uh-hum 

393.71 397.42 B: over [noise] total nonsense 

397.64 400.95 B: um there there's got to be a way to encourage these people that ah 

401.95 406.64 B: [mn] having nuclear weapons is just not the way [sigh] i mean just because we have one doesn't mean [noise] 

406.65 409.19 B: doesn't make a whole lot of sense 'cause 

409.04 414.26 B: [noise] i mean shit [noise] i- it it it's getting out of hand [noise] and pakistan 

414.03 427.10 B: [sigh] is one of those countries that they have the country but then they have a whole lot of area [sigh] where it's just where they have sort of no control you know so they're saying for example [noise] osama bin laden might be somewhere in pakistan [sigh] and they have this 

420.18 421.68 A: (( [sigh] exactly )) 

426.90 441.75 B: [noise] i don't know if it's like desert area where people just sort of [sigh] they have just um like ah clans that sort of run things [noise] um you know i feel like we have no ide- we still have idea what's going on in that area [noise] i thought i really thought we had some better intelligence but um 

432.95 434.79 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] uh-hum [noise] [sigh] uh-hum )) 

442.83 448.15 B: [mn] i'm concerned you know countries like haiti um 

448.56 450.00 B: who knows what's going on 

451.53 454.54 B: [noise] terrorists can actually s- sneak into these countries 

454.55 462.37 B: hide 'em hide out and never be found until they want to be found [noise] i mean you know these the terrorists 

458.62 460.04 A: (( sure uh-hum [laughter] )) 

462.56 466.11 B: [sigh] they came from certain countries so i mean 

466.93 473.39 B: it would sort of behoove us not to [sigh] stronger look at our policy towards these countries [noise] 

476.69 480.09 B: [sigh] [noise] um [laughter] i t- think we've exhausted that topic [laughter] 

482.20 483.57 A: (( [noise] [sigh] u- um ))
