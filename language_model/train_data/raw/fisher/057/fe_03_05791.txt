25.74 26.92 A: (( [laughter] [cough] )) 

26.27 33.11 B: [sigh] ah well what family means to me i guess is um 

35.44 43.85 B: the people who are in my life ah at critical moments not necessarily a blood relationship 

43.51 44.36 A: right 

44.39 45.94 B: (( ah mm )) 

46.18 47.73 B: how how about you 

47.86 61.12 A: i definitely agree i mean obviously there is blood relationship which is the definition of family but then family can be so unconventional outside of that to the friends and the people who live with 

61.50 65.90 A: the people that you surround yourself with i guess that's all considered family 

66.74 69.94 A: it's anyone that you have a real association with um 

70.10 80.37 A: that kind of models maybe what your original family situation and what the ideal family original family situation who else can be considered family just taken on a whole new meaning 

81.12 82.64 B: right 

82.29 85.58 A: have you originally come from a big family or a small family or 

85.07 88.29 B: ah actually a very large family [mn] 

87.47 88.45 A: really 

88.95 90.40 B: yeah how about yourself 

90.69 94.91 A: yeah i used to have a very large i have a very large extended family my um 

95.10 99.35 A: nuclear family or whatever is just five of us but 

99.91 105.37 A: my parents come from huge families so that makes the rest of my family very big 

105.58 107.53 B: right mine mine ah 

107.98 113.19 B: my parents came from huge families also and in our ours i have ah 

113.26 116.35 B: have three brothers and three sisters [mn] 

115.56 117.55 A: okay so that's pretty big [mn] 

118.32 119.23 B: um 

120.15 123.46 B: but i actually consider the people that i work with 

123.63 124.57 B: ah 

124.61 130.36 B: a little bit more family than my blood because i you know spend more time with them 

130.65 132.83 B: ah than i do my 

133.20 135.32 B: relatives i guess you would say 

135.31 143.16 A: absolutely yeah i'm actually an actor and um i just got back from a tour where i've been gone from home for 

143.16 152.09 A: the last month and being gone all that time and spending time with the same eleven people pretty much for a month 

152.31 156.84 A: um and not only doing it just this one time but several times over the past year 

156.94 165.58 A: we're always asked about our relationship and um do we get along and i always compare them to my brothers and sisters where where we have fights 

165.57 176.23 A: and disagreements but at the same time we'd probably kill someone for each other and vice versa so it's very much like family another way of considering family 

176.03 185.47 B: right that's um i i work for a government office and ah [sigh] e- especially i um 

185.47 198.66 B: especially deal with two ladies on an on an everyday basis and um you know when when there's a tragedy or something ah in their families or or or our family we all share it 

198.63 211.56 B: and if there's you know happiness like a birth or you know a a marriage or ah you know anything that can bring upon a little bit of happiness we all share that also so it's pretty 

198.70 199.86 A: right 

211.53 214.90 B: um you know it's pretty much like a family type 

215.24 223.49 B: ah atmosphere that i work in which is a little i think unusual for a government office ah [laughter] you know but it is 

221.95 224.71 A: that does sound a little unusual actually [laughter] 

223.55 229.02 B: a [laughter] it it is a small government so i guess that makes it a difference you know 

230.49 231.43 A: okay 

233.24 240.77 A: so do you consider any of your friends family i love how i'm doing the interviewing [laughter] it's just might as well the conversation

252.24 253.47 B: um 

254.61 259.63 B: you know who that they then they're actually probably more than my family has been for me 

259.50 261.38 A: yeah
