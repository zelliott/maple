92.55 96.61 A: you know youthfulness it you pick up a lot of energy from kids so 

96.04 102.27 B: i thought you were going to say ah you were surprised you sound so youthful to yourself at screaming you do [laughter] 

100.96 103.12 A: [laughter] no no no i

107.16 110.13 B: ah no boy that's a tough field 

109.80 122.47 A: too yeah it it was very stressful but ah we're off the subject area anyway ah it's okay ah i think [mn] ah children substitute as as a family for me in a way so 

113.63 115.08 B: oh i'm sorry 

122.13 123.39 B: okay 

124.12 134.43 A: so anyway ah i ah let's see what does family what does a family mean to me well i think ah from observing my own family which is rather peculiar i have 

133.41 135.26 B: mhm 

135.46 138.04 A: i think that they probably 

138.59 147.46 A: ah it it represents security to my family they're very anal retentive and they're they're kind of a fearful bunch of people and myself 

146.33 148.36 B: are you an anal person 

147.95 158.98 A: well you know i've i've tried very hard to not be because i i've i'm i studied psychology i was a psychology major and the whole reason i studied psychology and then later counselling is 

151.18 152.59 B: [laughter] 

159.25 166.96 A: i i wanted to escape my earlier programing and good luck on that one 'cause that's a hard thing to do you know but 

166.83 175.26 A: um i i'd say that i i'm not nearly as anal as teaching calls for you know 'cause you have to do all the 

175.49 177.26 A: (( all day long but ah )) 

177.28 186.74 A: anyway my family ah ah has to me it means security because you can i fortunately is for all their peculiarities they're 

187.25 188.75 A: (( they're )) 

188.62 202.84 A: trustworthy you know i dependab- depend i can depend on them to be honest with me and tell me what they feel and not play head games and it's ah which is a good you know it's a good thing you know 

189.61 190.64 B: okay 

197.57 199.52 B: (( yeah )) 

201.08 202.46 B: yeah 

202.93 205.99 A: 'cause a lot of people don't even have that much with their family so 

206.16 207.34 B: i know 

209.28 210.94 B: well fortunately um 

211.19 213.32 B: i'm adopted and so um 

213.85 217.48 B: i can always [sigh] view my family more objectively 

216.69 218.03 A: (( yeah yeah [laughter] uh-huh yeah )) 

218.13 221.23 B: because i knew i was from an entirely different gene pool 

220.53 221.87 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

221.61 227.52 B: i like to think a much much deeper gene pool [laughter] because 

224.16 227.21 A: [laughter] yeah that's 

227.75 233.83 B: i was the only one in my entire family to not only go to college but be a college graduate 

232.56 234.08 A: yeah yeah 

233.87 243.85 B: because my family we're from south dakota and i love my parents deeply but we give new meaning to the term [laughter] trailer trash [laughter] 

236.24 237.69 A: (( yeah huh )) 

241.27 249.01 A: yeah well i tell you what ah north dakota you say north dakota south dakota i've been through there ah it's

251.29 252.24 A: (( ah )) 

252.76 258.23 A: i did i did go by there yes that that's i guess that's a different part of the state but ah i 

257.38 263.85 B: that part of the state is overwhelming and just really cool so like i said you know being adopted i could like look 

259.10 259.94 A: yeah 

260.20 261.45 A: yeah yeah 

264.30 271.02 B: stand back and see what aspects of my family i did not like 

270.34 271.62 A: uh-huh huh 

271.24 274.71 B: and that did not work for me and try not to 

274.76 280.15 B: pick on those co- um pick try not to take on those characteristics 

279.64 280.81 A: yeah yeah 

280.52 284.45 B: you know and um and for the most part i think i did a pretty good job 

284.37 286.90 A: were you adopted at an early age 

286.59 298.10 B: um yeah so my parents you know i don't even think of other parents i was just they're the only ones i know and ah i think i had an advantage because um a lot of times if i know 

298.12 305.02 B: a friend and what i don't like about his or her parents i don't like about i don't like about him or her 

305.32 310.96 B: and [sigh] and i think you know y- you just kind of don't even think about 

306.22 307.28 A: (( mhm )) 

311.13 314.87 B: your family you just become like them 

314.58 318.73 A: yeah i i ah s- spent some time ah 

318.96 325.84 A: [mn] ah on on live it's it's called live journal it's a ah website for journaling 

322.95 324.02 B: okay 

325.55 326.61 B: wow 

325.85 338.40 A: and um ah there's a kid that i talk to on there every once and a while he's he's got massive family problems 'cause his father is so incredibly obsessive and demanding and ah 

338.90 341.31 A: (( [mn] ah he's um [mn] )) 

341.64 351.99 A: i i i keep wanting to tell him look you have some of the same traits your father does i know that that would i i know that would just really upset him terribly because he hates his father just terribly but 

349.51 350.40 B: [laughter] 

351.13 351.79 B: (( [laughter] )) 

352.19 359.12 A: but ah you can't escape you you really can't escape who who who raised you and and ah you you 

357.24 359.73 B: [laughter] right 

359.34 364.52 A: there's a there's a i suppose there is a genetic com- component to that too but ah 

364.79 372.35 A: um that that early childhood is really really it really forms a lot of your 

372.71 375.09 A: your mental patterns i think ah mm mm 

374.42 376.86 B: well what helped me so much 

377.22 379.69 B: in trying not to take on 

379.72 390.20 B: negative qualities of my family i mean it just sounds really horrible but not [laughter] only was i adopted i i'm smarter than my family 

389.03 390.97 A: well yeah i know that's 

391.20 397.13 A: that's ah but you know intelligence is a funny thing it really is yeah 

395.27 400.52 B: [laughter] yes and i'm not being a snob or arrogant at all but just 

400.53 402.01 B: (( um yeah )) 

401.17 404.93 A: mm well if if you are you are [laughter] 

402.97 410.03 B: but um what i'm saying is and i don't look at it as being better or worse than somebody else but i could 

407.17 408.07 A: yeah 

408.12 409.06 A: yeah 

410.12 416.58 B: i could stand back and look more objectively you know what don't i like about my family 

415.82 416.72 A: uh-huh 

416.62 418.55 B: and try to be 

418.62 423.61 B: a more positive person and have more positive things because you know um 

424.42 434.07 A: i think we a lot of people do that i know i try to but it's like i i have my own set of of peculiarities and and ah 

427.48 429.21 B: yeah 

433.33 435.07 B: yeah and i think we all do 

434.55 440.55 A: yeah it it's really hard for me to be judgemental you know have you ever heard of this this test called the um 

441.07 446.32 A: ah oh let's see what's the name of that thing it's the type indicator test ah 

445.69 446.75 B: yes

449.31 450.38 B: (( correct )) 

451.72 452.75 B: okay 

452.01 464.71 A: and ah it's very hard for me to make judgements about people even though i know if there's somebody i don't really want to be around i can really i know it but but i'm not ah i can't judge people it's it's an it's an impossible 

457.68 459.74 B: [laughter] yeah 

462.89 464.88 B: (( that's good )) 

464.51 470.40 A: impossible thing and i guess it's a good thing being with the a teacher of emotionally disturbed kids it's hard 

469.54 471.25 B: yeah 

470.47 480.65 A: it's a good thing to not judge sometimes i i go too far to to meet them half way but but um it's very hard for me to make judgements about people 

472.93 474.17 B: (( yeah )) 

479.68 488.17 B: well in a way though at least in my family i i had to because you know you ah ah with my family 

486.89 489.18 A: you've got to protect yourself ah so 

488.49 490.64 B: well [sigh] you had to make judgements w-

490.63 500.15 B: w- why don't i like this quality in my parents why don't i like this quality in my aunt and uncle oh it's because 

494.24 495.22 A: (( mm right )) 

498.30 498.97 A: (( mm mm )) 

499.69 500.69 A: yeah 

500.06 510.41 B: being rude isn't very [laughter] effective being loud and obnoxious isn't very effective in getting what you want so in that way i had to be [laughter] obs- ah ah i had to be judgemental [laughter] 

502.11 503.39 A: right or 

506.46 507.96 A: right in the case of 

509.78 511.98 A: i understand understand um 

511.96 520.54 A: it's like in the case of my uncle he's he's a tremendous bigot he has many positive qualities but he's a bigot and and i don't like to 

518.22 519.94 B: right 

520.45 527.34 A: [mn] i don't like to absorb that quality you know i i i i just don't like to absorb that from him but 

522.57 523.61 B: no 

527.47 528.81 A: um 

528.66 530.26 B: of course it wouldn't 

530.42 535.68 B: ah maybe this is ah stereotyping but i'm thinking arkansas there'd be a lot of people [laughter] like that [laughter]
