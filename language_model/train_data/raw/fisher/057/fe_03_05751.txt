0.75 6.70 A: ah hi my name is george i'm eighteen years old and i live in the bronx 

6.66 12.37 B: hi my name's dan [lipsmack] i am ah thirty five and i live in ah canada actually [noise] up here in canada 

12.41 14.10 B: so it's good to so 

14.70 17.56 A: all right that's pretty cool um do you wanna begin 

14.70 15.55 B: um 

17.49 31.42 B: sure ah computers and education whether they're good or bad um i i on one hand i i guess it's depending on what you're studying [noise] definitely um there are obviously ah uses for computers to simulation i think 

31.32 41.12 B: um but ah you can simulate for situations if you're you know if you're doing drafting or if you're doing architecture or engineering and those kind of things obviously computers play a big role in that 

41.60 43.96 B: (( um and so you can ah )) 

44.68 50.49 B: [noise] you know off the top of my head that's something that is a good thing i think they can they can help in those areas for sure [noise] [noise] 

51.35 65.45 A: [noise] yeah yeah i i think the like diagrams and like the little the little like movies they have on how things work i think that like those sit well beyond like describing it 

52.32 52.98 B: (( [noise] )) 

65.62 77.40 A: but um [lipsmack] it it also has to be monitored because like i go to school and like and and i have a computer course and like half the time [lipsmack] i'm sitting there playing on aim 

77.56 80.64 B: see and that's just it ah you're on the internet you're wasting time 

80.33 81.80 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

80.77 83.50 B: um you're checking your email accounts [noise] and so 

83.52 87.57 B: ah that that's a problem and i think some of it too with some of the ah 

87.64 94.21 B: the protection devices [noise] they use on some of the computers for you know so you can't look at certain websites and stuff like that like they've got the 

94.09 107.25 B: lock out i mean that takes out certain words like you know if if i'm doing a research project on something and i type it in and and and i can't get access to the sites i want because they're blocked for you know 'cause there can be one word somewhere on the site or something eh 

107.24 111.75 B: um and and that so the the blockers they put on it they can can hinder it [noise] 

111.90 116.46 B: and you just waste your time looking for stuff and you can't get access to it [noise] um 

116.89 117.95 B: i think that 

118.05 130.36 B: one of the challenges of computers can be too that that you have to you know if you're doing homework and you have to send your your homework to a certain email address or something um it assumes that you have access to the internet at home 

130.96 136.42 B: um or or somewhere publicly that you can get access to and you may not right um 

134.66 147.63 A: [noise] [noise] yeah yeah um i i know a couple of people that [noise] that um don't have it and like and the teacher's always like [noise] ah you could always go to the library you could always um 

148.72 160.04 A: go to the neighbors but like it it's it's kinda hard 'cause like a library stays open till like five six o'clock is that right [noise] 

157.55 163.26 B: yeah yeah i mean an- and often time you're we're doing homework and stuff later in the later in the evening 

163.08 177.69 A: yeah an- and not just that like if you have sports after school but if you had the weekend i guess it could work [noise] [noise] [noise] 

166.81 167.74 B: mhm 

169.90 177.23 B: yeah yeah i think computers can help too um because ah for a lot of trades and a lot of jobs 

177.35 184.05 B: i mean that's especially typing and those kinds of things too you're building you're typing skills up and there's a lot of trades and there's a lot jobs 

184.07 185.72 B: we don't need those tools 

185.79 193.21 B: like in the sector [noise] and so by using the computer for for ah education you're learning those skills kinda by default 

185.90 187.64 A: yeah 

193.59 199.83 B: ah and you can and so you don't maybe don't have to take a class on how to type because you've kinda picked it up along the way 

199.95 204.09 B: as you're doing you know using your computer for for education kinda stuff um 

204.27 210.46 A: yeah i think there's definitely a lot more good aspects of it than bad because like 

208.86 209.44 B: (( mm )) 

210.53 218.84 A: well like o- everything we mentioned like it's just like very minor so far like checking your email when you should be working 

215.84 216.93 B: (( it is yeah )) 

218.74 227.59 B: yeah some of it's it's self discipline eh i- i- it's it's if you have a s- it can it can harm you it can it can help you depending on your level of self discipline 

219.00 220.97 A: but like 

227.03 230.35 A: yeah yeah it could be helpful if you want it to be 

229.87 231.43 B: yep [noise] for sure 

231.71 232.49 B: um 

231.85 244.67 A: yeah i definitely think they're great but that they have like a bigger future um i um you can take classes in it i haven't done that yet but it's a lot cheaper than h- h- ah hiring a tutor 

244.51 257.61 B: yeah doing stuff over the internet and i mean you can i i like what you said about watching videos because i know there's some courses that ah university courses and college level courses where you can yeah you you do your assignments you watch a clip at your convenience 

257.84 268.22 B: of the of the of the prof teaching [noise] um and it might have been recorded you know months ago or or years ago or or the day before but you get to watch it at your convenience and it 

267.76 273.87 A: [noise] yeah you get to pause it when so that you have enough time to take notes and listen 

268.24 269.12 B: (( yep definitely )) 

274.21 282.17 A: 'cause that's that's like ah a a problem i find in the classroom i'm i'm not that quick of a writer so i wind 

279.87 280.58 B: (( yep )) 

282.22 285.78 A: um i wind up writing whether i'm listening 

285.61 286.69 B: yep 

286.13 293.35 A: and i i know what i wrote but like there's some parts of the lesson that i missed just because i was writing 

291.74 292.51 B: yeah 

293.20 299.27 B: i wonder if that's a drawback of using computers in education as well is that our our written skills ah 

299.27 312.47 B: you know [noise] perhaps for writing and printing don't develop so much because we're not relying on that anymore we're relying on our typing skills and so ah [noise] um you know i i work with high school students and ah i see times and times you know 

305.92 307.16 A: that's true [noise] 

312.39 322.52 B: high school students who have just writing that's just horrendous i think part of the problem is um that they're just spent so much time typing that they haven't developed that that writing skill 

322.67 330.49 B: um well enough and if they're gonna be doctors that'll be great 'cause they don't write well anyway but [laughter] um yeah 

325.66 328.55 A: [noise] [laughter] that's true [noise] 

331.04 333.98 B: um what else about computers that is good or bad um 

335.92 343.29 B: [noise] it's it's ah it's much more in- ah instant if we're looking at textbooks generally there are you know a year two or 

343.68 346.84 B: or even perhaps in some school systems quite a bit older with 

346.26 348.96 A: [noise] oh yeah that's that's definitely true 

348.80 355.04 B: computers you have up to date [noise] you know ah you've got that in- information at your fingertips that's up to date 

354.32 367.91 A: yeah and um instead of having to go buy new ones you can just download them [noise] [noise] it's just like like the best part about it i think is that it's cheaper 'cause like 

355.63 356.46 B: (( and so )) 

359.98 361.50 B: exactly 

361.81 362.55 B: yeah 

367.68 372.00 A: i'm a student i have a seven dollars an hour job 

371.61 372.40 B: (( mm )) 

372.02 377.65 A: [noise] i don't have any money and i definitely don't wanna be spending the money i have on books [noise] 

376.63 378.69 B: yep yep for sure 

377.95 389.36 A: so [noise] so yeah the computer and um and pretty much everything is there on your screen and all you're paying for is just internet service [noise] [noise] [noise] 

388.51 390.73 B: yep yep yep for sure 

391.06 392.43 B: (( um i'm )) 

392.83 395.68 B: trying to think what else is ah [sigh] possible to 

396.03 403.52 B: in ah computers i know with with younger kids i've got i've got two kids [noise] um and they're coming into grade school and they've already learnt the [noise] 

403.56 409.33 B: basic you know how to how to turn on computers how to you know how to how to navigate with the mouse all this kind of stuff 

409.48 410.75 B: and um 

411.03 419.42 B: [noise] and in a sense it's for them to come into kindergarten now and come in to grade school they'll be using computers in those classroom situations 

419.44 429.32 B: and they can use it to to learn to their fine motor skills um they can ah they're learning their their letters and and and stuff like that um a lot quicker 

429.46 435.44 A: yeah the interactive learning with certain computer programs and little games that 

433.45 434.21 B: yeah 

435.48 441.37 A: um are fun to play and they teach like little kids how to spell their a._b._c.s 

440.97 442.06 B: exactly 

441.41 444.07 A: um that's also very 

444.15 446.76 A: um i definitely think there's 

447.24 456.21 A: a whole lot more positive sides to having computers than negative i mean like sure you can fool around on like look at porn or whatever 

455.48 456.60 B: yep 

456.73 458.79 A: learn how to build a bomb even 

458.62 459.46 B: (( sure )) 

459.55 460.67 A: but um 

461.48 465.35 A: but there's so much good sides to it that it doesn't even compare [noise] 

465.20 472.75 B: yeah yep [noise] it's a it's just here i mean it it's a medium that's being used everywhere and to use it in education makes sense 

472.87 473.86 B: um 

473.94 483.18 B: i mean one of the challenges i guess is is to using computers in education assumes that the schools can afford [noise] you know school systems can afford i don't know what it's like in the in the states situation 

483.22 493.95 B: i know some schools are quite a bit behind in the times in in having computers that are up to date here in canada ah to be able to use some of the newer software and to be able to you know be fast enough to do what they need to do on the internet 

494.28 500.73 B: um [noise] but i think some companies i._b._m. and mac and some of these big companies give discounts to schools 

500.83 506.63 B: and ah assuming that's happening that's good but some school systems might not have the money to have up to date stuff 

506.67 510.79 B: um and ah i don't know if that could be a drawback 

511.28 512.55 B: ah in the long run [noise] 

511.49 525.45 A: [noise] [noise] yeah um it would be in like poor neighborhoods that don't have as much money but like they're all their um all their computers and software would be a lot older and like they'd fall back 

524.85 526.15 B: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

525.75 531.71 A: as would a teacher um all teachers would educate 

531.92 535.04 A: but like not all computers could 

534.51 543.37 B: mm [noise] yeah that's makes sense yeah yeah y- y- tea- teachers are confident but there you know computers is a tool it's not a great tool if you can't do the right job 

543.32 544.99 A: yeah 

543.76 546.46 B: mm yeah yeah 

545.88 550.26 A: 'cause teachers don't get old i mean they do but um and that's the way 

549.22 554.08 B: [laughter] no i know what you're saying yeah yeah [noise] um 

555.35 560.09 B: [lipsmack] getting back to the internet stuff um i think that ah [noise] 

560.67 567.89 B: i think that using the internet in in classes and using internet even gives you access to libraries afar and i can look 

567.83 578.55 B: and find out ah in my area for example i can look and see which of the ah metropolitan area i can look and see which ah libraries locally or college libraries have particular books that i need 

578.71 592.23 B: and instead of going there in person and so it's it's a time saver for me i can find out if they have it online find out if it's checked out or not and and you know go and get it in person rather than having to drive all these places and and find out um 

592.51 596.72 A: ((  )) 

593.49 594.42 B: (( yeah )) 

595.02 596.07 B: (( um or y- )) 

596.15 597.29 B: (( or you )) 

597.66 599.29 B: (( could just get a ))
