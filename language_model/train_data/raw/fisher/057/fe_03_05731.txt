14.80 20.88 B: right well i guess i guess what they're trying to get at is do we think that that er computers 

21.10 32.68 B: are you know can can enhance education or can harm it but i i guess the whole point is if you leave education up to computers it's harmful but if you use them as a tool like you said then 

31.58 33.19 A: exactly 

32.58 38.53 B: then [mn] i mean for one thing you have to teach students how to use computers 'cause it's a reality of the world 

37.89 39.22 A: absolutely [noise]

82.20 83.01 B: right 

85.70 96.78 A: really can't can't get by because they don't have the necessary skills they've been phased out so er you know without question you're gonna want to use computers in the educational process

341.25 342.23 A: uh-huh 

342.71 348.81 A: i think so you know i'm like you know computers and education is a no brainer really you know it's like in this day and age 

347.29 348.12 B: yeah 

348.68 359.25 A: they go hand in hand you have to have computers in order to provide a proper education because that is simply [noise] where we are in history right now 

357.45 365.58 B: right it's all about educating about how to use computers and then educating you in using computers for things like rote exercises 

365.01 366.31 A: sure 

365.60 373.02 B: um to get instant feedback to individualize um you know [mn] exercises to each student's needs 

371.47 381.53 A: well also because the biggest a big part of our lives is spent looking into these boxes you know and like you need to know how to utilize the tool 

377.19 378.17 B: right 

381.31 382.08 B: (( ahah )) 

381.35 395.00 A: completely the better you know about the tool that you're using er you know the more efficient you're gonna be and and the better you're gonna be off er you know as far as er being a good worker or whatever it is that you wanna do with it research it doesn't really matter [noise] 

384.77 385.51 B: yeah 

393.17 394.00 B: right 

394.68 398.63 B: well i think part of it too is that you don't want the computer 

398.73 412.48 B: doing i mean the computer needs to be the teacher's aide it cannot be the teacher itself because i think students especially kids are gonna always need that interaction and that you know [mn] i mean there's a whole socialization element of teaching and 

402.17 403.49 A: right 

410.32 421.94 A: yeah without question without question like i was saying before human interaction's definitely really really important [laughter] so i guess you know i think we've pretty much covered it david 

415.56 417.25 B: (( mhm mm )) 

421.48 423.67 B: (( i have- we have to stay on ten minutes )) 

421.96 422.52 A: (( [mn] )) 

423.48 424.83 A: [laughter] 

423.73 427.19 B: i think we have another few um anyway [laughter] 

426.58 430.06 A: yeah seriously so how's business out there 

429.85 437.09 B: i'm doing fine i've got er you know i i tend to get like a new client every one to two months depending on on sort of 

437.12 438.86 B: my luck or whatever or 

438.65 439.63 A: okay 

439.00 441.28 B: um you know and and so um 

441.19 447.12 A: so how do you go about it you just sit down and talk to them about er you know what their business is 

445.48 454.58 B: i network that's i network and i network and i network and then and then the more people that know what i do the more can people you know refer clients to me i rarely 

451.09 451.81 A: (( yeah )) 

454.61 460.94 B: find clients directly it's more often that i em someone will call me and say listen i met somebody who i think needs what you do 

460.91 463.02 A: how do you go about writing a business plan 

463.51 467.24 B: um well i i come from a venture capital background 

466.68 467.65 A: okay 

467.11 480.47 B: so i've seen hundreds of business plans and em for the last year and a half i've been actually writing them how do i go about doing it is i i mean i've got a em a template and i follow it and i but i work very hand in hand with the entrepreneur to 

469.91 471.44 A: right right 

479.66 481.10 A: sure of course 

480.42 494.54 B: to make sure that they own the plan that the the plan contains you know what they believe and um but you know i i i do the writing part i do the er some of the market research it all depends i mean i i can do some people come to me with a plan 

482.28 483.55 A: right right 

494.69 496.06 B: and um 

496.39 502.53 B: need to you know for it to be sort of edited and to make sure that it's all it can be 

501.05 504.21 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] suitable for getting a loan or whatever 

503.18 508.71 B: yeah the loan or venture capital financing or an s._b._a. finance in your case 

506.15 507.07 A: yeah 

507.79 511.11 A: how how is the venture capital market [laughter] these days 

510.48 520.19 B: a little better than it was but still not g- it's not like a little better than it was six to e- to ten six to twelve months ago but but nothing like it was two or three years ago 

511.84 512.90 A: yeah 

516.71 517.82 A: okay 

518.91 521.57 A: back in like ninety eight ninety nine 

520.56 524.09 B: no no no nothing like that it will be a while before it's that way like that again 

521.75 522.54 A: yeah 

522.91 525.76 A: i doubt if it'll ever get back there [laughter] 

525.16 526.58 B: it probably will 

525.97 527.19 A: you think 

526.60 529.36 B: sure some day probably in our lifetime but 

527.48 533.47 A: it's like people were just like really high on this whole internet concept and then they crashed 

531.58 541.22 B: well something will come along that we haven't even thought of that will reveluti- or will either revolutionize the world or will make us think that it will 

540.38 544.59 A: exact- [laughter] i was about to say it'll make us think it'll revolutionize the world [noise] 

541.26 542.28 B: (( [noise] )) 

543.44 551.76 B: yeah well the internet has inte- has revolutionized the wo- the world it's just that it it hasn't revolutionized [noise] i don't think it's 

551.81 556.42 B: created [noise] as many new businesses as people thought i think it's improved businesses 

554.46 555.54 A: no 

555.84 559.67 A: everyone thought it was like the er pot of gold at the end of the rainbow 

558.94 560.50 B: yeah exactly 

559.81 564.23 A: but unless you have you know a solid business plan a business model you know 

564.13 565.55 B: right that actually 

564.49 566.98 A: you're done exactly 

565.63 569.34 B: involves revenues and [laughter] profitability mhm [mn] 

567.53 573.16 A: right right right instead of eyeballs [laughter] collecting eyeballs doesn't really work out so well 

573.18 574.54 A: it's interesting 

573.97 584.13 B: yeah like this client's idea w- involving the education using using the internet you know through you use the internet to and the computers to get to 

579.08 580.08 A: (( mhm [noise] [noise] )) 

584.61 590.61 B: um this educational tool for and it's a very er reasonable price it's much cheaper than 

590.75 599.89 B: using um tutoring exactly and and therefore can reach you know much more sort of the middle class which is what probably needs it the most 

591.89 593.01 A: tutoring 

593.05 594.05 A: yeah
