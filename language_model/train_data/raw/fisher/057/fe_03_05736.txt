193.16 198.14 A: i don't think it is i mean i'm a student i don't know but i think uh [lipsmack] 

197.90 203.76 B: it would be pretty hard you'd have to end up buying a lot of books which you'd only read once and then never use them again you know 

202.89 205.54 A: yeah right definitely [laughter] 

204.07 209.45 B: yeah so you'd save your money i i know i have a friend who got got got his masters twice
