2.03 3.14 B: hello 

2.61 3.96 A: (( [noise] [noise] hello )) 

5.05 6.12 B: (( [lipsmack] hi )) 

5.29 7.31 A: how's it going 

6.48 8.08 B: h- h- hi 

7.99 9.68 A: how's it going i said 

9.29 11.41 B: i said it's going well how are you 

11.08 13.18 A: [noise] [noise] good good 

12.35 14.77 B: what do you think about computers in education 

14.98 17.63 A: [noise] um [noise] i have mixed emotions 

17.34 18.39 B: oh you do 

18.29 20.71 A: yeah i see positives and negatives 

20.40 22.47 B: uh-huh what are the negatives 

22.72 23.82 A: (( [noise] [noise] um )) 

23.94 30.61 A: kinda makes them a little bit lazier it at times promotes plagiarism 

26.40 27.25 B: uh-huh 

30.28 31.24 B: uh-huh 

31.77 46.55 A: [noise] [lipsmack] it also makes it more difficult for teachers to find plagiarism [noise] you know that they have security of websites plus the fact in college i remember at the beginning of college the biggest thing was being able to buy papers online 

40.98 41.69 B: ri- 

46.36 47.37 B: uh-huh 

47.61 51.35 A: [noise] [noise] yeah so i mean there're there are obviously vast advantages [noise] 

51.23 52.60 B: right 

52.96 57.75 B: [lipsmack] well i personally believe that the advantages out weigh the disadvantages 

57.70 59.80 A: [lipsmack] it's possible 

58.20 63.76 B: and i i think that ah people have found modes to cheat 

63.89 76.23 B: ah no matter what um is going what is available but i think that ah the major advantage is the fact that ah there's so much more access to information 

76.67 81.13 B: (( and um that you know there it's i think it's )) 

81.73 95.24 B: the information that's available is limitless ah through computers whereas before when you had to kind of dig it up by hand and and through books and through paper publications that were available through libraries um 

95.21 98.65 B: [lipsmack] ah you just couldn't ah access that much information 

98.67 102.72 A: [noise] [noise] completely agreed [noise] [noise] however con- consider this 

100.03 101.10 B: so 

102.82 109.84 A: [noise] you sound like you're a you're a at least in your mid twenties if not pos- probably older 

108.83 110.07 B: i am 

109.69 123.66 A: i i'm personally in my mid twenties [noise] and i can tell you that when i was younger you know i started with an apple two c. when i was really young which obviously is nothing like computers of today and there was no internet [noise] i mean i had to [noise] 

111.71 112.55 B: uh-huh 

116.58 117.56 B: uh-huh 

123.75 138.50 A: i i had to experience things and do research on my own on a lot of things and i can have though and i still have those capabilities just as i'm sure you do because when you were in school there was no such thing as that do do i children today 

138.51 147.04 A: have those capabilities of uh-oh the internet is down the computers are running slow there's a lightening storm outside and you can't turn on the computer 

147.89 152.76 A: do they even know how to go to a set of encyclopedia's do they even have a set of encyclopedias 

152.86 160.95 A: can do they know the dewey decimal system for christ's sake i mean there are so many different angles of what happens 

160.97 162.96 A: if technology fails 

164.13 174.64 B: [lipsmack] yeah um i mean that's an interesting [noise] proposition ah i guess what i would say to you is that the dewey decimal system would be ah a- 

175.15 178.87 B: um a dinosaur [laughter] and and 

177.48 186.48 A: [noise] of i really it already is i mean everything is on computers as well but when the computer system is down you still got to go to the cards [noise] 

179.39 180.99 B: and right 

181.52 182.44 B: right 

186.38 195.47 A: i mean and that's and that's that's just one little stupid example but there are there there are endless things that although you can do everything on the computer 

190.11 190.95 B: (( true )) 

195.89 203.31 A: one little switch one little problem and the computer goes down and it's not like only one aspect of the computer goes down the computer goes down 

203.64 205.38 B: yeah 

204.58 210.02 A: and i am all for technology in as a part of learning as a big part of learning 

210.38 211.98 A: provided that 

212.39 215.36 A: it doesn't [noise] completely supplant 

215.50 224.83 A: the rest of the rest of education and and the the actual manual learning which it inevitably does [noise] because if you tell a kid okay 

220.09 221.02 B: (( mhm )) 

224.79 232.39 A: you can do this which will take you five hours or you can do it this way and it'll take you one hour which way is the kid gonna do it 

233.37 236.33 B: well they're gonna do in the way that it's gonna take one hour 

235.96 237.05 A: of course 

236.56 243.12 B: but i i think the computer is no different than than anything else it's it's it's a it's a tool 

242.97 251.72 B: and it's a tool that can be abused but it's also a tool that if taught properly in terms of it's use ah can be used um 

252.38 265.21 B: um to be product- you know just to increase productivity [lipsmack] so um i don't really see it as that much of a deterrent i mean i you're certainly able to do a whole lot more things educationally online 

265.23 274.37 B: than you could ever do before ah and i'll just give you an example for ex- um i have a nephew who is younger than you are who's twelve 

274.71 282.35 B: and um his mom is able to not only check to find out what his homework assignments are 

282.47 287.29 B: online because that's how he accesses his a lot of his homework assignments 

285.19 286.21 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

287.45 298.08 B: but um he's also able to transmit his homework assignments online back to his instructor whether he's there in school physically or he's at home sick 

296.29 297.37 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

298.02 304.61 B: so i think you know it's it's like i said it's a tool it it it doesn't supplant the the need for knowledge 

298.07 300.15 A: [noise] right 

304.09 312.14 A: [noise] i co- i completely agree you know i took i took my my last year in college i took a class online 

312.18 324.59 A: completely online there was no classroom the instructor gave the assignments online all the required readings we took our tests online in a given time period everything was done online [lipsmack] 

313.81 314.71 B: right 

324.08 325.29 B: right 

324.65 334.38 A: but at the same time [lipsmack] you know i once did a research paper [lipsmack] and it had something to do with government and i accidentally went to this site 

334.33 341.72 A: called white house dotcom the white house dotcom or white house dotcom i don't remember the exact wording but it was one of those two 

340.17 341.06 B: uh-huh 

341.65 342.50 B: uh-huh 

342.07 351.62 A: now there is let me just tell you that i accidentally found out that there is a big difference between the white house dotcom and the white house dot gov 

352.11 356.97 A: okay because with dot gov is the official white house site quote unquote 

356.74 357.75 B: uh-huh 

357.17 361.39 A: whereas dotcom led me to a pornographic site 

361.34 362.32 B: uh-huh 

362.29 368.13 A: so now how do you feel when your twelve year old nephew discovers these types of things 

368.06 378.33 A: completely by accident or whatever [sigh] but you it a twelve year old boy or girl for that matter that accidentally stumbles on this site isn't going to have the same reaction that i had which was 

378.94 389.56 A: hey you know that's kind of rude almost or or bad for i mean it's it's good for traffic for for these companies but at the same for our education system and for our children's sake 

389.34 400.34 A: it's really a terrible thing and i was actually kind of upset because i needed the information but from a twelve year old's standpoint forget that especially from a a fifteen year old's standpoint you know 

399.61 405.75 B: well i don't i mean i don't know that that's a whole lot different than a twelve year old going into a 

405.82 414.50 B: a a st- a store that sells magazines and newspapers and happens to see a pornographic magazine whether it's whether it's in 

412.28 419.37 A: [noise] big difference a they all come in they all come in plastic b. the stores that don't have it in plastic all have people watching you 

415.59 416.51 B: yeah 

417.91 418.83 B: uh-huh 

419.31 420.26 B: uh-huh 

419.95 434.71 A: i mean there's there are clear regulations all over that whereas on the internet it is so hard to place regulations and although there are parental guidance i mean i happen to be in the technology world and it so so i do a lot with computers 

431.13 431.96 B: (( yeah )) 

434.36 435.54 B: right 

435.01 443.30 A: however i can tell you that it the the guides don't really work well because they end up eliminating half of sites that you need 

443.38 450.48 A: so in in the end you need to you need to remove those bands otherwise you can't do the the research that you need to do 

450.96 455.52 A: and in in doing so you give access to these unrestricted sites 

455.34 460.67 B: but is it your position that you would rather not have the tool of the computers in education 

460.71 466.16 B: um to avoid ah the risk of stumbling accidentally on a pornographic site 

465.47 470.94 A: is that my position one hundred percent not my position however is that 

468.03 469.05 B: oh okay 

470.84 482.47 A: we need to find ways to incorporate it as a tool and be it that a tool like a text book just a tool one aspect of learning 

482.76 484.45 A: (( with the caveat )) 

484.64 488.59 A: that there are better restrictions and guidelines 

489.62 501.16 A: um you know for me when i was a little kid if i if if i saw a naked woman on national geographic explorer that was something that was oh my god you know [noise] i mean 

499.37 500.58 B: (( [noise] right )) 

501.43 510.81 A: it's amazing in talking to my to my to my ten year old cousin the things that he has seen on the internet and how great he is with a computer [noise] and i think that's amazing 

506.92 507.79 B: (( yes )) 

508.80 509.64 B: (( yeah )) 

510.80 519.16 A: [noise] ah i mean i think back one of i i double majored in college and one of my majors was m._i._s. management information systems which is pretty much computers 

519.94 525.83 A: i know a lot about computers and i am amazed as to how much my ten year cousin already knows 

526.00 530.46 A: about computers it blows my mind away his knowledge [noise] 

527.25 528.14 B: right 

529.85 531.06 B: right 

531.10 537.29 A: but it scares me at the same time i mean you're talking about one little plug and its' gone [noise] 

532.85 534.15 B: yeah 

534.55 539.39 B: well knowl- know- know knowledge knowledge shouldn't be anything to be afraid of 

541.59 550.39 B: i mean knowledge is wisdom and it's power and ah and and the more we have the better off we all are 

544.70 546.52 A: knowledge is power 

550.28 557.06 A: yes and no you give you give the wrong people too much power before they know how to use it and bad things happen [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

550.46 552.14 B: so it's certainly nothing 

557.57 563.99 B: well yeah that's y- you know is is is the glass half full or is the glass half empty i mean like again 

563.96 574.34 B: i i would not shy away from ah providing any individual with as much knowledge as they are able to consume and if a computer can help do that well then so be it 

574.24 580.75 B: um you just as i said you have to be more involved and you have to have more hands on 

580.57 593.46 B: see your thing is not really about computers in education it sounds like you have a lot of issues just around technology in general i mean one way of looking at computers in education is to forget the internet altogether i mean you j- you just automatically assume 

593.41 598.49 B: that when you say talk about a computer in education that you're talking about somebody surfing on the web 

598.73 599.89 B: a lot of you can buy
