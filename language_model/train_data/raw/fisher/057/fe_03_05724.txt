74.26 75.29 A: no 

74.89 89.18 B: north korea i don't know if you're have you been following it north korea has already implied that they would have the capability to send missiles to reach several cities in the u._s. 

88.85 89.52 A: (( [sigh] [mn] )) 

89.20 93.65 B: including in california and i think new york 

92.89 99.42 A: er i don't i don't you know my my actually my my girlfriend is from korea and she's from south korea of course 

99.30 109.00 A: but you know she says that like we think of them as such a threat there but they have no money like they're all starving over there they have no money whatsoever 

108.44 111.39 B: well the same thing with with iraq [mn] 

111.63 122.30 B: the people were starving but not not saddam and his er his er proteges and his police force and military force and all the palaces that they had 

122.34 127.79 B: e- [mn] when what you're saying is absolutely true about south kore- i mean north korea 

127.65 141.22 B: i remember when er one of some of the astronauts said from outer space when they looked at korea you saw the south lit up like new york but the north was totally dark 

131.81 132.94 A: mhm 

134.06 134.91 A: (( ahah )) 

137.41 138.96 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

141.60 151.71 B: so [mn] you're absolutely right but does that mean that the government itself doesn't have any money you know what i'm saying so it's for example let's say 

148.54 149.80 A: yeah 

151.52 165.93 B: you and your wife you have money but you don't buy food and you don't pay your rent and yo- you just bought drugs with it and beer and you kn- you follow what i'm saying [laughter] you have the money but it's how you're spending it [laughter] you know 

156.17 157.04 A: mhm 

160.70 162.44 A: yeah of course of course 

164.01 166.34 A: right of course but um 

166.45 174.57 A: yeah of cour- i know i under- i understand what you're saying but [mn] it it was proven because er the the er the dictator of um 

174.01 175.83 B: north korea 

174.88 188.80 A: of north north korea yeah his son was er trying to go into japan for god knows what reason er and er he he went in into the the customs official and he didn't even have the power to get 

188.79 192.00 A: his son into japan japan wouldn't let him in 

191.78 206.35 A: that's how like weak they really are they they a lot of times i think they're saying things like that they have these [mn] er these powers to to send these missiles but i think a lot of times it's just to make them seem more powerful than they than they are 

205.61 206.65 B: (( [noise] mm )) 

206.96 212.68 B: okay um and you know when they asked that question i i i immediately 

209.94 211.27 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

213.09 215.35 B: my first reaction was a 

215.28 227.20 B: a you know before when we had a war we knew who to fight right let's say it was germany or japan but now it's not necessarily a country any more but let's say an ideology 

220.84 221.84 A: yeah 

226.72 227.73 A: right 

227.01 237.29 B: for example you s- you did not you said there was not a country that may be threatening us but do you think possibly al qaeda is threatening us 

236.53 250.72 A: al qaeda yes okay that's that's true yeah the question was do what other countries i i think i think terrorists in general are a threat whether it be al qaeda or or or saddam hussein um but 

240.83 242.94 B: (( right [noise] [noise] )) 

250.80 255.03 A: [mn] that's i mean these people are here i mean they're in our country 

255.15 257.70 A: a lot of them um 

256.60 258.92 B: right yeah absolutely 

258.00 263.35 A: you know er i i don't know where you're from i'm from i'm from new jersey in new york i'm in the city every day 

262.25 264.01 B: i'm in new york 

263.58 264.78 A: oh okay yeah 

264.22 266.57 B: same in new york city 

265.18 279.56 A: yeah so i mean like i'm in penn station all the time there's always guards there and everything and i have family in israel too so i mean they're like not doing real well i mean they have they have terrorists like people that blow themselves up like every day 

269.37 270.70 B: (( right mm )) 

278.85 281.29 B: mhm 

279.49 287.61 A: it's it's absolutely ridiculous um so i think terrorists of course are are a threat to us i th- however i don't think i'm not s- 

287.57 295.69 A: i don't think a a specific country is a is necessarily a threat when i think of a threat i i i think of someone that can actually 

296.18 307.56 A: touch us you know like literally bring our country completely down which is what we did to iraq i mean we completely dis- dismantled their whole entire government and and 

300.51 301.43 B: (( yeah mm )) 

306.80 310.63 B: [sigh] but yet our soldiers are being killed every single day 

310.27 319.80 A: absolutely absolutely because i think the problem is i think i think people initially when we got there 'cause we are very good in war you know we have amazing power 

319.83 321.47 A: um 

321.24 333.59 A: we have amazing power in war but [mn] the problem is building it after the war we we went in there and we and and i i definitely agree that saddam hussein's a bad man i don't think there's anybody in our country that that disagrees with that 

333.39 346.01 A: however we went in there and we we got rid of him and and disrupted the entire government and took it down and and now i think they thought that we were gonna come in and we were gonna you know we were gonna set up a whole other government and and what not but 

345.89 356.18 A: we didn't really have a plan for that you know and i think that's why a our sh- and i think it's only unfortunately it's and i have friends you know over there it's only gonna get worse because we're not 

356.01 364.45 A: we didn't we're not sending in social social people and and lawyers and people to to literally reorganize their government 

364.27 376.46 A: if we are we're not working fast enough 'cause there are people starving there you know there are people starving and dying and the whole entire culture the whole entire museum was looted and and that's like all their 

367.86 369.51 B: right 

376.49 384.21 A: their treasures of like two thousand years i mean our country is like only three hundred years old and the- it's like two thousand years 

384.34 390.68 B: you know the only thing em the only thing that that ah raised a flag is when you said we got rid of saddam hussein 

390.25 391.20 A: yeah 

390.66 403.61 B: we we we we chased him out but we didn't get rid of him and that's that i think is is key if if we can have his head on a stick and and show everybody 

393.29 395.65 A: we chased him out we haven't found him yet 

398.22 399.39 A: yeah 

403.25 404.10 A: yeah 

403.48 409.62 B: then i think that would really help a hell of a lot 'cause i i have a feeling these a lot of these iraqi's 

406.38 407.55 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

409.42 418.73 B: are still kind of er tentative and er afraid [laughter] to really help themselves er i only mean in the u._s. 

416.19 417.46 A: [sigh] of course 

418.21 419.49 A: yeah 

418.99 432.69 B: and you know it's amazing how we we we can not get get osama bin laden we could not get muller omar mohammed and now we can't get saddam and his two sons what the hell is going on man 

423.77 425.21 A: [noise] i know right 

427.01 427.91 A: uh-huh 

432.43 434.06 A: i know right 

433.11 444.15 B: and they're offering how much are they offering right [mn] twenty five million for for saddam that's er how much it's not it's beyond a fortune over there and the same thing with er 

440.42 441.31 A: (( [sigh] [noise] )) 

441.98 445.67 A: yeah oh my god that that's like the whole national economy 

445.13 457.57 B: yeah gee [sigh] [laughter] right [laughter] oh my god i don't know what's going on but er you s- so you feel safe huh i i i still feel that um [lipsmack] 

445.94 448.00 A: (( yeah that's ridiculous )) 

449.80 450.97 A: yeah 

457.08 464.30 A: i you know i don't feel i don't wanna say i feel safe i bel- i i feel i'm just answering the question i don- i don't say er 

457.67 459.94 B: (( but )) 

465.59 468.60 B: if it's not a country who whose the threat to us 

467.96 469.62 A: i think the terrorists 

469.51 471.15 B: right okay 

470.08 473.91 A: i don't think that necessarily a country itself like 

471.57 476.61 B: but if the country is re- remember what bush said and er 

476.52 488.71 B: it it's not even that is has to be you but if you're a abetting them and aiding them and sponsoring them whatever then you're it baby we're gonna call you to the task 

483.50 484.40 A: yeah 

488.86 497.25 B: we're gonna say you're just as guilty as a- for example i gave you the knife to go kill the person hey so they're gonna come to me 

493.95 495.19 A: of course 

495.40 499.96 A: but anyone that's funding them absolutely i totally agree with that yeah [noise] 

497.40 499.29 B: yeah 

499.58 511.99 B: and now they're realizing over here in the u._s. we've been funding them by allowing sales of illegal cigarettes um drugs and and all kinds of things um 

509.24 510.21 A: yeah 

511.22 512.57 A: yeah 

512.38 518.11 B: that are being sold and and the money is is being s- funneled overseas 

517.45 519.10 A: yeah it's true 

519.09 520.47 B: (( oh [sigh] )) 

519.54 521.67 A: i think they have a lot of er 

521.78 525.85 A: [sigh] i mean obviously saddam you know he took a lot of his own money 

526.00 527.72 B: yeah 

526.56 527.93 A: yeah 

528.03 536.67 B: it's amaz- okay so you're in the east coast too i i would wonder how somebody whose more or less say central u._s. would how they would feel 

535.42 538.03 A: oh yeah you know i think [sigh] 

538.06 540.50 A: i think it depends who the person is too 

540.48 541.45 A: (( you know i think [mn] )) 

541.34 546.59 A: er people on the on the er east coast especially new york are a little more 

546.60 556.48 A: cultured especially 'cause we were hit by the the trade center and and er i do- i don't know i think we're just a little more cultured and wise and um 

554.94 555.76 B: (( mm )) 

556.27 562.82 A: you know i've talked to people in texas like on the computer or something and i don't spe- specifically er 

563.40 575.90 A: we um support our president i don't think he's a very good president er at all um i think i respect our country and and i love our country and i'm i'm a patriot through and through but 

575.72 581.15 A: i'm a patriot and that's why i can say [laughter] i don't like him you know 'cause i'm embracing my freedoms 

580.82 582.57 B: right 

581.11 593.66 A: of being able to say that but i i think a lot of people like when they say oh you're you know if you don't support the war you're not supporting our boys but that's not that's not true i i completely support our troops because they're just following orders 

593.41 594.35 B: right 

594.03 595.48 A: you know however 

595.87 599.89 A: [sigh] i don't necessarily support how he's going about doing it
