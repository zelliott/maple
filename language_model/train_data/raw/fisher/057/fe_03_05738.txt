0.34 2.34 A: hello my name is matthew 

1.83 3.81 B: hi matthew my name's michael 

5.05 8.14 B: so we're supposed to talk about computers and uh education 

7.38 11.07 A: hey yeah wh- what do you think about computers and education 

11.69 15.76 B: [laughter] uh i think it's pretty much mandatory how old are you 

11.85 12.85 A: [laughter] 

15.66 17.42 A: i'm twenty five 

16.67 21.16 B: twenty five what was your what was your experience with com- computers in the classroom 

17.59 18.72 A: yeah 

21.08 26.54 A: uh pretty minimal i guess i mean i don't uh 

26.60 31.67 A: there were some in my last graduate class we used uh 

31.74 34.11 A: (( basically um [lipsmack] [sigh] )) 

34.66 36.84 A: what you would call a uh 

37.19 43.29 A: discussion group yeah we used it we had an online discussion group that was used pretty minimally um 

38.33 38.98 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

43.33 45.56 A: i mean i've always used 

45.84 49.39 A: computers outside the classroom to do papers and stuff but 

49.50 52.06 A: i guess they're probably talking about 

52.47 55.72 A: computers from a young from uh 

56.05 60.32 A: used in elementary school i imagine i i we had 

60.54 63.22 A: uh computer games in fourth grade but [sigh] 

63.55 71.47 A: we l- and learned some programs in fifth grade and stuff but we but we didn't really learn i di- it wasn't very rigorously drilled you know 

66.37 67.27 B: (( [mn] uh-huh )) 

71.51 76.80 B: huh that seems that seems odd it would seem that you you say you're twenty five so 

72.00 72.56 A: (( [mn] )) 

75.24 76.39 A: yeah 

77.04 77.60 B: (( [mn] )) 

77.63 84.35 B: like it- probably c- i guess maybe at the beginning of of [lipsmack] when they were really loading the classrooms up with them i guess 

83.93 85.58 A: i think so yeah 

84.87 88.23 B: so w- w- you're did you say graduate school 

88.13 90.07 A: yeah i'm in graduate school now 

89.32 91.07 B: yeah so what were you studying 

91.20 92.80 A: english and education 

92.50 94.42 B: english and education hah 

93.89 99.57 A: yeah and there hasn't been much use for a c- i mean i think it's 

99.66 113.35 A: it's important to educate kids on computers but i think that especially in suburban areas kids will probably have computers at home anyway but i think it's probably 

113.39 116.22 A: much more important to get out to 

116.65 121.13 A: areas where they might not have computers in the home um 

120.78 123.05 B: yeah mainly like to the inner city 

122.49 126.23 A: right um i think that- that's just to 

126.70 130.07 A: equalize things you know at this point but 

127.91 139.85 B: yeah well i i mean i know for a fact a guy that i work with his wife's uh works at the school board out here um i don't know what school district it is but it's round the ardmore area you know right outside the main line 

139.77 141.53 A: mhm 

139.82 152.76 B: [sigh] and he was telling me that most of the classrooms are actually uh [lipsmack] uh hooked up wireless there's a hub in the in the centre of the classroom [lipsmack] uh ceiling and everybody's basically issued laptops 

149.96 151.69 A: mhm 

152.88 153.89 A: oh wow 

153.70 157.18 B: yeah which i thought was pretty intense i mean 

154.65 155.36 A: [mn] 

158.11 165.27 B: [sigh] you know even if you're buying them a thousand at a time i still can't imagine you're getting 'em for less than you know nine hundred a thousand bucks a pop 

165.30 166.89 A: (( yeah i have no idea )) 

165.37 169.31 B: lot of money you know what i mean i think that it's also going to create uh 

166.93 167.97 A: yeah 

169.54 175.64 B: [lipsmack] [sigh] like a huge gap like i think is what you were alluding to earlier like between the haves and the have nots and 

174.97 178.56 A: yeah that would be definitely a bad thing yeah [laughter] 

178.24 179.65 B: yeah i think so too 

179.47 185.25 A: i think yeah 'cause that's how n- things normally are so th- normally done really i mean 

185.48 189.85 A: at the place i i mean where i've i've done substitute teaching 

190.08 197.32 A: and there's always a computer at least in the in the normal classes there you know the regular um 

197.44 204.46 A: non accelerated classes there's usually one computer and uh you know 

205.51 215.79 A: kids get like you know fifteen minutes twenty minutes on it i think and then there's computer time where they'll be taken to a computer room 

215.85 222.42 A: and and for like a half hour will get some tutorials on how to use the computer whereas 

222.43 225.70 A: the accelerated class and this is basically 

225.76 229.62 A: um an inner city sc- not really quite inner city but verging 

229.74 232.43 A: uh in s- the 

232.92 240.83 A: [mn] accelerated class they have more computers and but again it's a matter of having [mn] just like time on the computer like about five minutes 

239.91 244.27 B: yeah it doesn't seem to me you could get very much done in fifteen minutes i mean 

243.36 244.18 A: (( no )) 

245.30 252.81 B: i'm you know when i have to teach myself a program i mean i i have to set aside a you know at least an hour and a half to two hours a night for 

253.00 267.27 B: [mn] you know months at a time just to just to learn you know the intricacies of it to find out how to make it do what it is i'm trying to do and you know if they get a half an hour what can you possibly learn in half an hour i mean other than [sigh] you know how to get to a porn site you know you can get on the internet 

265.45 266.54 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

266.69 272.87 A: well that's and they mostly what they're learning is is not computer related it's just they're learning 

272.90 287.08 A: they're really learning math and other things you know o- o- on programs that are not you know they're they're just learning normal e- curriculum material just on a computer they not actually learning 

285.24 286.00 B: (( oh )) 

286.77 287.54 B: (( mm )) 

287.48 293.29 A: [mn] the intricacies o- of computers themselves or software or anything like that 

292.17 302.97 B: [mn] yeah i mean really wh- what can you do any more i mean i work in a warehouse for christ's sake and i and i mean i there's there's a computer there that i that i have to deal with like every day you know i mean wh- 

301.32 302.34 A: mhm 

302.92 307.48 B: seriously i mean aside from from from operating heavy machinery 

307.61 308.74 B: i mean [mn] 

309.16 314.80 B: y what isn't touched by it i mean i think it's pretty important you know i mean that people get comfortable with them [noise] 

311.35 312.42 A: right 

314.06 320.73 A: yeah and especially i think [sigh] it would be a very good idea to get kids to 

321.19 322.71 A: try to uh 

322.75 327.32 A: or i don't know how it would be done but to get kids to learn how to 

328.08 336.45 A: kind of work out problems with computers on their own you know do uh you know so that they can they can actually 

336.66 340.49 A: get the those kind of white collar skills of having to 

340.56 344.48 A: actually uh you know fix computers on their own 

343.94 344.77 B: uh-huh 

345.34 346.21 B: (( [mn] [sigh] )) 

345.36 351.22 A: that kind of you know work with uh complex software programs things like that you know 

349.89 360.17 B: yeah [lipsmack] i was uh i i had i'd actually gotten uh b- [mn] [sigh] uh pretty discouraged because i i spent a lot of money and time uh 

360.21 361.93 B: [lipsmack] doing photoshop 

361.92 363.04 A: yeah 

362.02 369.74 B: [sigh] and um you know i had gotten a pretty good handle on it but then i was watching television one night and there was some like little kids 

369.98 373.21 B: on this program and they were talking to their teacher 

373.20 381.54 B: and they had just casually mentioned that they just photoshopped this kid's head in on this photograph to give to the teacher so that he would remember him by 

379.90 380.67 A: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

381.53 394.16 B: and [laughter] you know i was studying this program for like six months and and you know i i'm finally getting a handle on it and here's these like kids who're like in elementary school just dropping it as you know a passing aside 

393.57 398.29 A: yeah a precocious kid who's determined to do something funny is a very uh 

398.49 401.57 A: cre- you know u- unstoppable creative force i think 

401.45 402.71 B: yeah 

402.17 404.75 A: yeah so i think if you give kids 

405.03 410.33 A: if if you under- if if you give kids uh certain tools and and 

410.53 416.87 A: and they uh and they have their leeway to do what they want with them rather than having to perform uh 

417.02 423.71 A: mechanical dry tasks they can be very uh creative you know can learn m- faster that way probably 

420.96 421.80 B: (( [noise] huh )) 

424.61 428.02 A: i don't know it depends i mean it depends on the kid of course [mn] 

426.82 429.17 B: [sigh] yeah i would imagine i would imagine 

429.00 430.90 A: (( you know but i think )) 

431.00 435.91 A: i uh which i think is uh an important part of education that people 

436.03 436.77 A: should h- 

437.06 446.86 A: need to come at it in different ways i think that's why i had a hard time learning c- computers actually before i got my my own 'cause i was learning them 

446.99 456.39 A: in school before uh learning how to use them in school before i actually got a computer and i learned much more by having a computer in my home than 

456.49 458.71 A: i did doing the kind of 

458.76 461.33 A: [lipsmack] uh exercises um 

460.89 461.79 B: (( [noise] uh )) 

461.54 469.90 A: i think doing exercise is important but it it i think it's also important just to h- have kids kind of have free rein to experiment with things 

469.74 480.93 B: yeah i would guess see i have no experience with it at all because i've been out of school for a real long time and i i basically anything that i know i you know i had to learn myself to teach myself 

474.20 475.45 A: mhm 

480.62 482.25 A: right 

480.90 495.88 B: um but it it seems to me that i i mean friends of mine have kids who are you know they're they're just walking but a a buddy of mine his kid can like stumble over to the computer and he knows how to get on the disney website i mean the kid can't even talk yet 

493.72 494.73 A: right 

495.20 496.49 A: [laughter] 

495.87 499.21 B: i'm i'm i'm being serious it's like the honest to god truth [mn] 

497.62 499.02 A: oh it's hysterical 

499.67 500.96 B: (( so [sigh] )) 

502.74 510.28 B: i think it's it's it's mandatory i think that if you're going to be able to do anything i mean if if it grows the way that it has been growing 

510.20 511.87 A: mhm 

510.82 517.18 B: i think that you're going to be at a r- real severe disadvantage if if if you're if you're in the dark which 

517.21 523.42 B: again like you had alluded to earlier in the conversation i mean y- [mn] the suburbs have got it because that's where the money is 

523.62 529.90 B: the inner city doesn't i mean it's it's the same it's the same it's just a new dividing force 

523.84 524.80 A: (( yeah i know )) 

529.80 536.38 A: it yeah it's it can it has the potential though to to be something better i think you know and uh 

536.53 538.09 A: it's i think [sigh] 

538.66 547.48 A: you have we have to be deliberate about um making sure that it doesn't develop that way i think you know that 

545.58 548.78 B: yeah do you think that that do you think that that effort's being made though 

549.64 557.12 A: yeah i don't know i i imagine that there are m- probably a lot of people thinking about that you know and and 

549.96 550.52 B: (( [mn] )) 

556.12 560.80 B: but that doesn't s- it doesn't seem to be [mn] your experience though with your substit- with your uh 

559.76 563.22 A: not in not at my level not at you know not in the d- 

563.23 566.70 A: in new york department of education you know i i 

567.36 577.04 A: i don't think that i mean i think people think they're making that effort probably by having computer time you know for a half hour but i don't think they realize that how 

577.65 580.17 A: really ineffectual that is probably 

578.81 580.99 B: yeah yeah yeah 

580.65 581.69 A: (( you know )) 

582.14 588.24 A: and maybe they think they're doing whatever they can with what they have which i mean maybe they are but [noise] 

588.93 589.75 A: they 

591.07 592.87 A: it's kind of uh 

593.08 599.91 A: you know th- i guess they really have limited resources and that's what really needs to happen and i think that's pr- you know it's probably part and pa-
