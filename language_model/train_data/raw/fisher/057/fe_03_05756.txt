0.58 1.88 A: hi i'm ron 

1.78 4.83 B: (( hey ron ah my name is ryan )) 

5.27 6.54 A: hey ryan how's it going 

5.38 6.01 B: wha- 

6.12 8.48 B: good where're you from 

7.71 10.42 A: i'm ah just south of disneyland in 

10.51 11.62 A: california 

10.55 11.94 B: (( disneyland you said ah )) 

11.89 13.07 A: yep 

12.72 15.17 B: i'm in new hampshire so we're 

14.54 15.80 A: oh that's a ways 

15.44 23.64 B: yeah we're a little ways away from each other well ah the topic is computers something i haven't really thought too much about what about you 

21.08 22.16 A: right 

24.05 29.98 A: um yeah i'm i'm really into computers i think that having computers in school is a ah 

30.42 32.56 A: is a real big advantage 

32.17 33.39 B: (( uh-huh [noise] [noise] )) 

32.74 33.73 A: (( um [noise] )) 

35.24 39.10 A: but i i think you gonna always have problems of 

35.92 42.21 B: (( mhm that's )) 

39.96 43.99 A: ah [sigh] you know the best computers still can't replace a good teacher 

44.74 45.62 B: (( true )) 

45.86 47.47 A: what do you think about that [noise] [noise] 

48.15 52.13 B: yeah the my first [sigh] yeah that that's a really good point ah 

52.26 53.08 B: 'cause 

53.93 55.60 B: well here's the thing is that 

55.88 68.31 B: everyone has a different learning style [lipsmack] and some people for instance do real do real well with reading whereas other people do better with like talking things through 

68.50 69.24 A: (( right [noise] )) 

68.59 71.13 B: and so a computer is ah 

71.30 80.93 B: probably gonna give you more reading skills like you probably read more on the computer ah but i suppose there's other things you do i mean c- a computer is more of like a 

81.58 85.88 B: either a research tool or like a practical 

85.89 87.01 B: um 

87.89 100.62 B: [sigh] ah what's the word like it's like utilitarian you know like okay use excel to do this or that um [lipsmack] so it seems like it just it seems like it depends on the type of 

91.22 92.10 A: right 

94.60 95.89 A: right 

100.83 102.25 B: the type of student 

102.32 110.57 A: right and also i guess the kind of computer because of the point that you made about everyone having a learning a different learning style it kinda makes ah 

107.59 110.12 B: (( mhm )) 

111.27 115.60 A: kinda makes an argument for having computers in school because the idea is that hey 

115.74 127.41 A: you know that the student can go as fast or as slow as he wants to because he's he's just using the computer by himself so i mean there's some- there's something i can see some things i think something else that would be 

121.69 124.19 B: (( [noise] mm i see your point )) 

127.51 130.19 A: would be a thing would be an issue of fairness 

130.23 137.15 A: because there is not enough money to go around as it is and what are you gonna do with the you know the richer school districts that get computers 

136.42 137.35 B: (( [noise] mm )) 

138.01 141.81 A: you know versus the ah the poorer schools who don't so i don't know [noise] 

141.33 146.30 B: ah yeah i mean i think fairness is gonna come down to 

147.07 153.91 B: [sigh] the fact that like we in education i don't think you actually can be fair like there's really no such thing because 

154.10 159.53 B: each student is so different each environment's so different i mean you can't 

155.70 157.35 A: (( [noise] right [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

159.62 170.52 B: you can't i mean no matter how much even even when you talk about money i mean maybe on some level you could you could ah equalize everyone's amount of funding but [lipsmack] 

170.85 172.16 B: even then 

172.07 183.20 B: like there's really not i mean every- you always have more intelligent students or more intelligent teachers and certain teachers flock to different areas and for me that's fairness isn't 

183.12 191.28 B: as much the issue i i've actually a question that maybe you know more about when it comes to computers and education is how 

191.39 201.51 B: how do you think they are primarily used because when i was at school ah there really wasn't much use of them so how like how how do you think they are used ri- ri- 

201.32 202.46 A: (( sure [noise] well you know )) 

201.55 203.00 B: nowadays 

202.65 208.09 A: well again i think now that the internet's coming you know coming really big i think they're 

205.64 206.54 B: uh-huh 

208.25 209.12 A: (( ah )) 

209.98 214.42 A: they have a lot more potential for uses as a learning tool um 

214.61 219.57 A: i think back in the back in the eighties they were just kinda thought of as a 

219.66 224.59 A: as an electric typewriter you know electronic typewriter and then now it's getting more to 

224.60 231.22 A: you know you you do all of your research on the internet and you never go into the you never touch a book and i think that's kinda bad 

230.44 237.29 B: [noise] right yeah i do to in fact that was one of my main questions was um 

237.81 247.31 B: [lipsmack] like in education it seems like you have two main types of education you have like the utilitarian type that i was talking about like technical skills 

247.21 255.61 B: ah you know like going to a tech school um but then you also have like a liberal education which is kind of learning for learning sake 

249.48 250.72 A: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

255.64 256.61 A: right 

255.99 259.00 B: and it's i mean from what i've seen 

258.98 264.57 B: computers used for i've seen them primarily used in the utilitarian sense 

264.53 269.30 B: ah used for like specific purposes and i'm not saying that's a bad thing at all 

269.25 276.56 B: but ah it seems to me that our education system was primarily set up to be more of a liberal arts education 

276.47 287.40 B: and then tech schools were more are more for either apprenticeships or tech schools specifically but like as far as education like the normal you know 

287.53 288.95 B: kindergarten through 

289.43 291.05 B: through senior high 

291.06 292.09 A: right 

291.26 295.19 B: it seems like it was primarily meant to be a liberal education so [lipsmack] 

295.31 300.40 B: it doesn't seem like computers would as much benefit that type of education 

300.69 302.50 B: i don't know what do you think [noise] 

302.18 311.27 A: [noise] right yeah i mean it's you know it's it's hard to say it's one of those things that you have to have computer skills ah to survive so i think there's definitely ah 

310.11 311.00 B: right 

311.50 321.29 A: you know it's just getting to that point where you know if you can't run if you can't do keyboarding at least ah you're just gonna be left out in the economy because you won't be ab- you know 

316.96 317.87 B: uh-huh 

319.83 320.81 B: right 

321.52 330.50 A: you won't be you'll be the guy at mcdonalds who doesn't know how to use the register you know so it's one of those um difficult things to say and i don't know about 

324.04 327.03 B: [laughter] right 

332.42 344.02 A: you know i think a lot times people say oh it's computers it's computers but in reality it's just it doesn't change anything because you're just you know you're still an underpaid 

344.89 345.91 A: drone 

345.73 346.79 B: (( [noise] uh-huh )) 

345.96 350.31 A: it's just you're an underpaid drone who gets to use a computer to do his job so you know it's 

348.35 351.04 B: [laughter] yeah 

350.44 352.30 A: so i don't know you know [lipsmack] 

352.62 360.58 A: but i mean i think as far as using computers in education i think it's definitely it's something you really need to need to have otherwise you're just gonna be 

360.75 365.64 A: you know computers are definitely not going away they're you know they're getting you know 

363.49 365.75 B: (( i [noise] right )) 

366.47 379.47 A: every eighteen months of the processor ah doubles in speed and you're hard drive size like goes up by ten times or something so i mean it's just something that you know if kids don't know how to use computers they're just gonna be stuck 

373.54 375.36 B: (( [noise] right )) 

379.32 382.15 B: so so it seems like what you're saying is 

379.53 380.32 A: (( you know )) 

382.31 387.37 B: and i hope now i'm not belaboring the point about the difference in technical and liberal education 

387.19 389.83 B: but it seems like you're main 

389.60 404.26 B: thesis is that a computer is necessary in education because without it without that technical aspect you're gonna be left out in the economy and the job market and i i mean i'm right there with you i've hundred per cent there with you but 

400.80 401.63 A: (( right yep )) 

403.04 404.52 A: yeah and i 

404.59 405.49 A: (( go ahead [noise] )) 

405.63 410.05 B: oh i'm sorry ah but it seems like it seems like my 

410.51 424.68 B: [mn] main concern in education is more the liberal aspects of education the um an and what i've seen and this is just my experience i don't know if it's even true but i've seen computers more used as a 

425.00 428.65 B: [lipsmack] ah sort of shallow learning tool 

428.81 437.01 B: they're either they're either used as like the technical in the technical sense which is i think legitimate or when they're tried to use 

436.96 439.31 B: to be used incorporated in 

439.24 453.68 B: like a liberal education it ends up being just shallow like yeah you can like you know look up on some internet sites and find some pictures or some articles but for the most part people don't do serious reading on the computer you know 

452.63 453.93 A: (( right sure [noise] [noise] )) 

453.50 456.21 B: and it seems like serious reading is what 

456.89 464.48 B: is what education is about primarily and and when i say serious reading i'm using that in a in the sense that 

464.45 477.27 B: that is broad i mean i mean i i put serious reading also with like if you're doing math skills and like serious work i'm just talking about [lipsmack] and it doesn't seem like computers lend to that very much 

473.55 474.69 A: (( right [noise] [noise] yeah i )) 

477.52 482.47 A: yeah i'd agree because it's it's one of those things that you can't take a compute- you know 

482.24 482.89 B: [noise] 

483.29 487.80 A: you can't sit ah you know with a computer screen in your lap and 

488.21 491.20 A: and thumb from page to page like you can a book so 

490.26 492.27 B: (( [noise] right )) 

491.24 494.56 A: until that that kinda thing happens um 

494.88 496.52 A: i think the you know 

497.06 505.83 A: the traditional form of education will always will always be and you know a teacher can explain something to you in a way that a computer can't so it's 

504.86 506.71 B: right 

506.19 510.71 A: you know it's hard but then again it it's hard to say because you can get 

510.60 523.16 A: if the computer stuff is done right you can get a level of information from off a computer that you would never be able to get you know unfortunately there's so much crap on the internet that it's it's hard to find good stuff but if you can find good stuff 

519.67 521.41 B: yeah 

522.96 524.74 B: yeah 

523.22 527.37 A: you know you can find almost anything on the internet so and it's always 

525.72 527.02 B: yeah that's true 

527.40 531.93 A: it's always hard i mean and and the kids are always gonna be more interested in the computers than 

532.34 536.57 A: [lipsmack] than a regular book just because the computer is more 

536.13 537.60 B: interactive 

537.00 544.82 A: yeah it's more interactive and it's more visual so it's one of those things that you know and i'm kinda and i'm a little bit concerned that you know 

539.85 540.86 B: right 

544.94 549.17 A: in a hundred years or so you know we'll be so away from books 

548.86 550.14 B: yeah 

549.62 553.52 A: you know that people won't even really have a need to read very much anymore right 

552.91 556.15 B: yeah that's i i have that concern too because i 

556.64 558.34 B: i see 

558.59 570.74 B: i see that education really about being about interacting with the great minds like it you know when you read a book you're having a conversation with plato or with lincoln or whatever 

570.61 571.49 A: right 

570.90 582.17 B: and ah that's something that will nev- computers will never really be able to afford i mean unless unless they make it so where you can in essence read online which 

582.05 592.68 B: is very tough i mean there it's just very possible to happen because you know i mean for me the main problem the reason i can't read very much on on the computers is the screen you know 

592.55 599.89 B: jacks up my eyes after a while but there's also something like romantic about being able to turn the pages
