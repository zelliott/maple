0.00 0.99 B: matt 

1.09 2.71 A: hi i'm fletcher 

9.67 10.50 B: hello 

10.34 11.45 A: hello 

11.06 12.91 B: (( hey fletcher )) 

12.98 14.51 A: hi what's up 

14.07 15.65 B: (( what's up the )) 

15.42 17.55 A: so what do you think about this topic 

17.17 24.34 B: uh i've i'm i'm very uh for it i would have to say computers in education is a very good idea 

24.98 27.59 A: yeah the thing is um 

28.31 39.89 A: um when i was growing up we always used apple computers and like i think once i got to about um [sigh] like middle school that we didn't use them that much 

31.92 33.20 B: right 

40.26 51.71 A: for some reason just didn't where i grew up we didn't i don't know maybe it was just like regional differences because i you know grew up in california and then i moved around and 

42.64 43.58 B: right 

44.17 45.65 B: and then what happened 

49.55 50.33 B: (( mhm )) 

51.80 57.20 A: i think it's kind of weird that a lot of people just i don't know don't 

57.44 60.28 A: don't think they're important in some parts of the country 

60.39 71.70 B: [sigh] oh i i i don't know well i i grew up in new york and i mean i i can't even imagine nowadays not even having a you know basic uh fundamental computer education 

64.47 65.38 A: oh yeah 

71.82 75.44 B: i mean kids nowadays younger and younger are starting to 

75.56 81.03 B: you know use the internet and you know become you know user friendly so to speak 

81.10 85.05 B: and um it's just only helps these kids you know become smarter 

85.24 89.84 B: 'cause i mean you learn words faster you know by muscle memory by typing and 

90.15 91.43 B: (( i mean uh )) 

91.49 95.76 B: i wish i had that uh opportunity afforded to me when i was growing up 

92.23 95.16 A: (( yeah )) 

95.73 102.51 A: exactly even in even in college i find like even like in my language classes 

95.94 97.87 B: (( but what are you going to do right )) 

102.61 115.83 A: like they don't even use technology for like you know just mu- you know there's some programmes that can help you with like pronunciation and [sigh] like they don't they don't use it i don't know why it's kind of weird 

115.18 116.55 B: (( mm )) 

116.97 124.94 B: well i'd have to say that when i first started really getting into computers was probably when i was in college [noise] and it just totally helped me out with um 

121.98 123.93 A: oh yeah 

124.93 136.96 B: you know with my papers and and you know obviously all that kind of preparation as far as research goes and you know cutting and pasting and i mean you know i don't know how old you are but i'm like i'm about thirty 

132.21 134.02 A: yeah 

136.73 138.60 A: oh yeah 

137.01 141.16 B: and uh that's when like probably like the whole you know 

141.08 152.90 B: windows and everything started coming out and that's when they became like very uh more mainstream than it was like in the past as far as education went but [sigh] and then it became more mainstream and it just seemed like you had to have one 

143.53 144.42 A: uh-huh 

149.53 151.24 A: yeah 

153.79 159.72 B: and whereas like you know not everybody had one before then everybody had to have one after that 

159.64 163.19 A: exactly yeah um 

160.23 161.58 B: (( seemed like it when i was in )) 

162.96 164.08 B: (( uh college )) 

164.85 178.33 A: [sigh] i i live in texas and it's just like there's it's very either either very urban or it's very rural and [sigh] like all the urban people seem a lot more tuned in to 

172.05 172.91 B: right 

178.91 181.24 A: more progressive things and more 

181.41 182.44 A: i guess 

183.60 192.03 A: uh rather than you know all the rural people who have hard time even getting internet and i think the internet is a big key too 

192.51 193.85 B: oh yeah i mean 

192.70 194.44 A: a lot of information 

194.15 196.50 B: yeah it's absolutely 

195.03 199.91 A: i don't know ho- how they use it in schools now but like you can find a lot of 

198.13 210.94 B: well as far as like um as far as research i mean i know because i have some younger cousins that are like into it right now so to say and uh whatever they want to find out about something like they have uh they have like a lesson plan for the day 

201.11 202.75 A: yeah 

210.95 222.57 B: and then when they have their free time most of the kids actually just they go to the internet they use the computers in the classroom and they find out more about it more than what they learned you know in that lesson for the day 

213.14 216.45 A: (( mhm )) 

219.47 220.64 A: yeah 

222.59 226.69 B: so kind of like it's their like unlimited uh tool to 

226.79 234.26 B: you know unlimited resource to find out more as to what they learned about or just heard about that day that's really interesting because 

232.48 234.15 A: right 

235.19 237.78 B: yeah it helps it helps push their uh 

235.29 236.44 A: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

238.08 243.82 B: [sigh] helps them question things more and you know f- feed their like you know need to to understand and learn 

243.86 244.96 A: that's true 

245.14 250.43 A: i find i think that maybe that using the computer now that it's getting 

250.67 257.74 A: things are getting faster and easier to use that like our attention spans are getting shorter 

258.32 260.48 A: (( do you think that )) 

259.66 260.88 B: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

261.01 261.57 B: (( [mn] )) 

261.13 266.08 A: like i don't know it just getting things instantaneously is just 

265.45 275.83 B: yeah i guess that kind of is like a uh i i wouldn't say like a national continuation or the next step kind of thing but i would say that that is kind of uh uh 

276.64 279.28 B: a uh you know a kind of of 

280.71 287.64 B: next step kind of thing whereas you know before you used to have to wait and you know you'd have to like uh you know actually 

287.66 299.38 B: sit there and and and have to wait but now since it is so fast that you kind of get spoiled with the idea of of attaining things so quickly so that maybe yeah you do attention spans get get shorter 

293.97 295.00 A: yeah 

295.70 296.61 A: mhm 

299.18 303.54 B: but then at the same time the trade off is that you probably like 

303.58 307.20 B: uh you know process things a lot faster as well 

307.35 310.06 B: like you actually in turn kind of speed up 

310.13 313.55 B: and maybe that's why people view their attention spans as getting shorter 

314.11 316.11 A: i think that's true for some people 

316.20 322.24 A: but um if maybe for kids maybe it's easier for them that now that they're growing up with it 

323.05 324.10 A: um 

323.64 331.52 B: [mn] yeah i think that um kids like nowadays is not the same as kids of old because they grow up much faster now 

331.34 332.42 A: yeah 

331.53 337.49 B: so when you talk about attention spans and all this stuff it's sometimes i think they're just using older terms 

333.88 334.70 A: uh-huh 

337.75 339.88 B: on a different generation 

340.10 348.43 B: but obviously kids will always be kids but i think that kids are growing up a lot faster because i mean i have a nephew and he's uh what he's going to be five 

347.81 349.27 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

348.66 362.58 B: and i mean most kids they can like speak and write and do stuff but i mean just because he's on a computer all the time he can surf the web he can like write the alphabet he knows like all the shape and knows the numbers he can count up to like a billion and i mean 

356.25 357.55 A: yeah 

357.81 358.77 A: wow 

362.53 368.62 B: that is i mean i say my opinion it's direct relationship with with having a personal computer at home 

368.93 370.66 A: yeah 

368.99 374.30 B: and the fact that he can use it on his own now and he's not even five he's four and a half 

373.40 374.38 A: wow 

374.33 378.95 B: yeah i mean what was what was i doing at four and a half you know watching sesame street you know 

378.68 380.58 A: yeah [laughter] yeah me too 

379.64 382.95 B: so it's like you know the kids are definitely different today yeah 

382.85 384.82 A: that's true that's true 

386.00 387.04 A: (( um )) 

388.49 391.69 A: but i think maybe there's just so much out there 

391.83 401.09 A: maybe it do you think like there needs to be some kind of like for kids do you think there should be s- such a thing as censorship or filtering and 

400.99 408.58 B: oh absolutely i mean i i don't i don't think uh a kid should just have free reign on the internet because i mean with the 

402.13 403.89 A: yeah 

408.85 413.94 B: introduction of this pop up garbage you know you just enter one wrong thing on the 

411.20 412.38 A: (( yeah i )) 

414.07 423.74 B: search engine and then like you know you'll get inundated with all this useless nonsense that you're just not even trying to find out about especially with a kid 

414.27 415.32 A: mean you can 

421.12 422.47 A: yeah 

422.63 433.75 A: so it's it's a trap too because it can be the best of the world and it can be the worst of the world you know just because there's just y- there's just so much information that you're not sure maybe 

427.97 428.96 B: exactly 

434.19 438.68 A: you know what to believe or if it's a reliable source or whatever 

437.64 438.20 B: (( [cough] )) 

438.79 445.72 B: oh yeah that too that's another thing also uh having a reliable source because there th you know with the internet um 

445.67 454.03 B: being up and running the way it is so many people have access to it that means there's so many different opinions and so many ways that things can be worded a lot of times you know 

454.09 457.26 B: sources can vary as to just one simple thing 

457.37 458.87 A: yeah 

457.54 460.17 B: you know like the primary colors you know 

460.43 468.77 B: and um yeah it's very you have to be very careful as to where you're getting your information from [sigh] but i think that's where that censorship needs to come in as well 

464.95 467.12 A: (( mhm )) 

469.18 472.77 A: yeah 

470.57 471.16 B: (( uh )) 

472.78 479.67 B: but then again it's also great for kids to try using computers early because they understand that the world is you know becoming a smaller and smaller place 

479.50 480.34 A: yeah 

480.37 481.49 B: (( yeah )) 

481.68 487.32 A: i think a lot of people who you do use the internet and for i think for information 

487.81 493.36 A: like i know like c._n._n.'s really popular i don't know how much kids kids read that stuff any more 

493.20 494.02 B: (( no )) 

494.03 497.97 A: if they you know go to all these news websites or 

498.74 500.36 A: i don't know if they just 

499.81 505.28 B: [sigh] well also like um you've heard of like you know the magazine people that you hear of like team people 

505.04 506.06 A: oh yeah 

505.35 507.91 B: they have a lot of sites like that for kids also 

508.02 517.01 B: they'll have like the junior version of like a big site i don't know if c._n._n. is up there but i mean that's very popular with kids also because i know that 'cause of my younger cousin 

517.11 518.36 A: yeah 

517.58 522.30 B: you know y- th- they have like it's like their whole little culture that they have within the web 

522.38 534.81 B: you know it's like depending on your age or you know what you know what kind of [mn] lifestyle you lead you know there's like a niche that fits exactly what you're into on the web and that's the great thing about it because it pretty much can service everyone 

534.64 536.22 A: (( mhm right )) 

535.25 547.64 B: so from young and old alike to you know [mn] you know crazy you know psychotic people to you know god fearing christians and whatnot you know i mean you know it's just anything you want it to be it's there 

543.36 546.15 A: (( [laughter] )) 

546.87 549.04 A: exactly like you can uh 

548.48 553.77 B: and i think you alluded to that earlier you said that you know it can be the best of everything it can be the worst of everything 

553.49 554.55 A: yeah 

554.59 563.28 A: i think it's really good to help like shape your interests or organize them um to find your niche and then 

556.63 557.95 B: (( [noise] mhm )) 

563.35 565.78 A: like organizing you know 

566.31 577.14 A: a community where you can talk to people and like using like live journal dot com or you know like having other people to talk to but not really 

572.76 573.79 B: what's that 

576.48 577.84 B: right right right 

577.99 581.00 B: yeah it's definitely yeah definitely like bring the people together 

578.19 579.74 A: i think 

580.97 582.23 A: yeah 

581.54 584.66 B: as far as like you know organizing interests and 

584.26 587.51 A: but as far as education i think maybe that 

587.83 598.52 A: there need there'll be a lot of a lot more change that you know we haven't really seen yet just because like people won't even be going to high school they'll like go take classes on the computer or 

591.34 594.29 B: (( um )) 

598.21 599.98 B: yeah oh yeah it's already happening now with
