0.00 1.76 B: hi my name is matt 

1.64 3.60 A: (( hi my name is andrew )) 

5.20 7.52 A: so what does family mean to you 

7.49 20.48 B: ah so you're going to make me start well let's see family has a couple of meanings right first there's the biological meaning the people who maybe raised you or gave birth to you and then there's more of a a deeper meaning to it like people take care of you huh 

9.37 10.14 A: (( yeah )) 

21.79 30.85 A: well would you say if it's a family if they don't take care of you at all it's it's like they like ah 

28.79 29.73 B: um 

31.86 33.23 A: if you're like 

33.26 38.48 A: part of the family but they're not really taking care of you 

38.97 41.45 A: and you're not very cohesive 

41.55 55.04 B: right that i think that's a good question and let's say that for example maybe you were were raised by different people than your biological relatives are and your biological relatives really didn't support you in that situation who really is your family 

54.83 62.44 B: i don't know i would say that both in some way are your family but i would be more inclined to say that the people who raised you are actually your family huh 

63.10 64.25 B: what do you think 

63.11 63.90 A: (( yes )) 

65.10 67.10 A: yeah i think 

67.21 72.96 A: to have a family you have to have someone to take care of you or look after your back 

72.87 83.75 A: and someone not necessarily biological because if it's their biological family they're not really a family it's just people who gave birth to you 

84.15 85.95 B: (( right )) 

84.44 87.06 A: gave you genetic codes and whatever [laughter] 

86.60 91.50 B: right but so to you what's more important is it's actually the people who do the work of raising you 

92.16 93.31 A: yeah 

92.71 105.48 B: yes oh i think i think i would agree but there's also something to be said about people who maybe rediscover their biological family after they've been raised by maybe a sub- you know ah a surrogate family 

93.64 94.47 A: yeah 

105.75 110.46 B: in that situation those people maybe have two families right because what if their first family gave up 

110.28 121.00 B: a child for like economic reasons and then later on their situation changed and they readopted that child but meanwhile in like the last ten years that that kid was raised by another family so i guess 

120.87 127.61 B: i guess it can even be both right so it's possible to have more than one family 

126.69 127.93 A: well 

128.36 133.35 A: would you still consider the family if they didn't take care of you at all 

134.35 136.16 B: yes if if they didn't raise you at all 

136.14 137.26 A: (( yeah )) 

136.68 141.15 B: yeah i think i would i mean i think in that situation let's say that let's say that i was adopted 

141.16 150.70 B: by another family which i wasn't but theoretically and then let's say that i found out that i was given up for adoption 'cause my parents couldn't afford to take care of me right maybe they were new immigrants or something um 

150.86 159.46 B: and then their situation changed and they became curious well i mean they tried to contact me and then over some time we became friends and we started a relationship and then 

159.25 168.39 B: you know i you know like even though i'm an adult now i still used to maybe i would still call them or talk to them and they would say yeah that they were my family 'cause they gave me my genetic code right they they're they're 

168.56 170.49 B: they're the people who gave birth to me so 

170.59 172.07 B: i think that's relevant huh 

172.81 175.77 A: well i guess it's part of your history but it's 

176.05 178.14 B: but you wouldn't say they're your family 

176.32 177.13 A: still 

177.57 187.40 A: i wouldn't say they would be my family because they didn't take care of me at all or i don't know anything about them ah maybe maybe later on they they may be my family but 

182.83 184.56 B: yeah i guess you're right 

187.04 194.79 B: but initially until they've earned they've kind of garnered that respect they're really not yeah i guess i guess in retrospect i kind of agree with you i don't know why i said that 

194.83 200.87 B: i think i would think of those people as my ancestors but i wouldn't say they're my family but that's there's a big difference right 

198.46 201.31 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

201.68 203.47 A: what what was that 

203.41 215.66 B: and i think there's a big difference between maybe your ancestors and your family i think what i was saying is i think the second group the people who like gave birth to you but didn't raise you i guess i would never think of them as my family but i would think of them as my ancestors or my relatives 

215.73 217.11 A: yeah i agree 

216.18 220.36 B: i guess that's what it is there's there's a difference between relatives and their family right ah 

221.00 225.89 A: well i guess so well if you never talked to your relatives at all then 

225.99 229.18 A: they wouldn't really be your relatives at all to you 

228.19 237.58 B: yeah they're not part of your family but on the other hand if you do talk to your relatives constantly then they are part of your family right it's a strange thing 

230.00 230.67 A: yeah 

233.30 235.00 A: yeah 

235.44 236.67 A: mm that's 

237.14 243.00 A: that's like what if you got like disowned if you got kicked out of the family or something 

242.48 245.59 B: right and you got adopted to another one 

243.66 245.11 A: (( it or that )) 

246.05 254.33 A: so that would mean that you're not part of that family anymore and would you still consider it family 

253.70 261.09 B: i think i'd consider it my family but people ask me i mean it depends on how old you are right and how how long ago this and for what reasons 

262.28 276.99 B: but yeah i mean i think if i was kicked out of my family when i was you know over sixteen or something then i would still consider them my family 'cause i would i'd always preface it by being like oh that i was kicked out and that they're actually my family and i i know that was a that's a tricky question 

277.03 278.15 B: that's tough 

279.00 280.32 A: (( right or or )) 

280.34 282.75 A: of if you were kicked out and disowned 

283.08 284.88 B: right 

283.48 286.24 A: then i don't know how would they 

286.65 290.35 A: how'd they be like are they still my family or 

290.44 292.87 A: or am am i not 

291.41 297.02 B: or would you be really pathetic and be like oh i don't have a family maybe that's what you would say actually huh 

295.10 296.61 A: oh yeah 

297.24 307.35 A: oh isn't that like what gang members do 'cause they don't have a real family they just their family and go to a gang which is their family 

306.66 316.39 B: yeah it's like a surrogate family they're kind of in a way they're kind of adopted so i guess that kind of brought us down to what it actually means to be a family right th- these people provide some sort of role 

310.03 311.60 A: (( yeah )) 

316.49 324.25 B: for you they provide some sort of protection and if that protections provided by like a a biological family or by you know friends or some sort of gang 

324.10 335.92 B: the definition's still the same right so i think well we can agree on this ah what that family actually does is provides protection and security and maybe guidance towards somebody as they in in their in their formative years 

326.00 327.44 A: yeah so you can 

328.23 329.03 A: (( right )) 

336.79 340.11 A: so you would dictate what your family is 

340.86 342.96 A: by being part of something 

342.39 354.51 B: yeah i would say that every family has certain roles to fulfil and upon fulfilling those roles they can be a family but if they don't then you know the question of whether or not they're actually your family is is up for debate right 

353.54 355.20 A: yeah 

354.50 363.97 B: you know if you're right you know maybe you grow up in a family but you know both your parents are alcoholics or gamblers and they've never really taken care of you and you're actually raised by a nanny or a babysitter 

363.92 378.48 B: in that case i would and then people would actually mean who's your family i don't i don't know or or if if you're raised by like the neighbor's family instead of it's more clear then i would be i wouldn't know who what i would say if i would say oh my biological relatives are or if i would say this neighbor who actually took care of me is 

367.50 369.15 A: yeah 

378.85 383.03 B: i'd probably be more inclined to say i don't i don't know actually what what what would you say 

383.98 385.28 A: well 

385.34 395.21 A: yeah it is like i would dictate what my family is so it wouldn't matter who whoever took care of me whoever took care of me would be my family so 

394.03 402.74 B: right so so if both your parents are gamblers or excessive drinkers and you were raised in fact by your neighbor you would still say that your neighbor is your family 

398.16 399.99 A: (( i wouldn't )) 

402.55 403.98 A: yeah more so 

403.99 410.20 A: but this they would still be part of m- my family if they're gambling or drunk or something 

407.17 408.17 B: yeah it's 

409.54 421.44 B: it's definitely a slippery slope 'cause i think i'd like this i think i'd like to agree with you and be like oh yeah my neighbor is my family but i think if that actually was the truth and somebody asked me i'd be like oh here's my family and boy do they suck right 

421.76 422.64 A: oh 

421.84 429.11 B: but ah you know then i would be like oh but i was raised by my neighbor but if people asked me what my family was i think i would still say my biological relatives even if they didn't raise me 

429.86 434.54 A: well i would it all depends if it c- came to that extreme i'd be like 

434.56 437.57 A: i would probably run away or something 

436.89 439.59 B: right [laughter] yeah 

438.96 446.24 A: so you'd probably like not have them as your family even say they'd be your family because they're a bunch of losers [laughter] 

445.97 450.22 B: yeah yeah i don't know it's tough wait how how old are you can i ask 

450.26 451.22 A: eighteen 

450.84 453.99 B: you're eighteen oh so so you're stuck you live with your family 

453.39 454.72 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

454.58 457.67 B: that's interesting ah so you are are your parents still together 

458.02 459.30 A: (( yeah )) 

458.84 461.55 B: yeah that's that's cool that's good 

460.80 462.30 A: how old are you 

461.81 463.26 B: i'm twenty three 

463.51 465.63 B: about to turn twenty four this weekend actually 

463.81 464.59 A: oh 

465.82 468.38 A: (( oh happy birthday [laughter] )) 

467.56 468.54 B: what's that 

468.43 469.80 A: (( happy birthday )) 

469.07 478.42 B: oh thanks [laughter] oh yeah but i moved out when i was when i was eighteen but again i was i was from a pretty happy household even though my parents did split up but 

478.35 485.99 B: and and so yes so in a way it's true i was raised by a stepfather so if people ask me who my family was i would be like oh you know despite the fact that i did see my 

486.14 491.70 B: my other father sometime there's no point to consider like the family unit like my mom and my stepdad and my brother and sister 

491.67 501.40 B: i never even for a second would have thought that my stepfather or that my you know that my other father was a family because he was just one person and even if he was married for a while ah later on 

501.62 504.42 B: still never thought of me as part of that family 

504.77 507.83 B: see i i guess our family's has to be more than one person too 

507.84 509.31 B: although not always 

510.02 512.19 B: i guess maybe if if you're among 

510.20 511.24 A: (( w- well )) 

511.26 515.15 A: (( how how long was your stepfather raising you )) 

514.92 516.62 B: ah since i was maybe two 

516.82 517.83 A: oh 

517.89 519.00 A: (( pretty young so )) 

519.01 522.48 A: do you consider him part of your family or what 

521.89 533.11 B: that's a good question not not really i mean yeah oh yeah i guess i no actually definitely i definitely do but there's always there's also some some confusion about 

529.27 530.23 A: (( no )) 

533.08 536.18 A: did you stay in contact with your original father did 

535.36 537.44 B: (( it what )) 

536.37 539.60 A: you stay in contact with your original father 

539.25 550.84 B: um no actually not not really in the beginning a little bit um yeah he was actually not even my original father just a second stepfather which it makes it even more ambiguous right yeah 

546.63 547.49 A: you could 

548.50 549.85 A: (( yeah so )) 

549.89 554.37 A: y- you don't do you consider him part of your family 

553.73 556.37 B: m- my second stepfather my first stepfather 

556.25 557.89 A: your first stepfather 

557.28 567.34 B: like certain no well and and here's why i guess when i was younger probably in grammer school i probably did but then when i grew older we grew kind of grew apart so you know and i you know i read 

565.86 567.85 A: so y- you actually did 

568.09 571.56 A: kind of disown him [laughter] as part of your family it's 

569.55 578.94 B: yeah in a w- in a way i mean i c- i um i was going into you know i was in high school with a different life i stopped seeing him so often and you know he was he was just an old fashioned kind of orthodox guy 

579.06 585.40 B: and a kind of i don't know i still write him sometimes i never hear back but i never think of him as part of my family 

585.83 588.16 A: but you still consider him part of your past 

587.82 599.95 B: yeah i can still i still yeah definitely when people ask me who raised me i would definitely mention him 'cause you know i saw him every other weekend and he he was really supportive when i was younger bought bought me all these toys and i had this special status 'cause i was his only
