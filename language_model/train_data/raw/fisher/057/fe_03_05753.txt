4.37 5.82 A: good how are you tonight 

5.46 6.82 B: i'm all right 

6.17 8.75 A: good um where're you calling from 

8.39 13.53 B: i'm calling from ah upper westchester county new york [mn] 

12.42 15.60 A: okay well i'm in ah lincoln nebraska yeah 

14.87 15.97 B: cool 

16.13 18.41 B: [sigh] how's the weather out there 

17.80 22.82 A: um hot quite hot yeah i think it's probably about ninety six today it's hot and humid 

18.86 19.96 B: yeah 

22.00 23.55 B: (( ninety six [noise] )) 

23.06 24.10 A: yeah 

23.89 25.81 B: damn that is hot [noise] 

25.05 27.82 A: it's pretty yucky in nebraska during the summer 

27.66 28.78 B: wow 

28.87 32.90 B: yeah it's pretty nice here it's like i don't know mid seventies maybe 

32.37 34.12 A: wow that does sound nice 

34.29 43.48 B: so ah i guess the topic is education and whether computers help or or harm education 

42.99 44.72 A: that's the way i understand it 

44.22 45.94 B: what do you think 

45.33 48.88 A: um well i guess i would have to say that i ah 

49.55 52.64 A: i think in some ways they harm by ah 

52.61 66.00 A: i i think um a lot of times they don't teach a lot of the basics and kinda get too complicated but um in a lot of ways too with today's technology and society the way it is and the way it's going i think it only can help 

66.25 67.76 A: um further our 

68.07 72.23 A: you know i th- i think it needs to be used in conjunction with other methods 

72.41 73.33 B: mhm 

72.88 75.72 A: but um i know um we have a 

75.78 86.47 A: two and a half year old and um heck in his day care room now they have you know computers already and i think that's good 'cause i know like my parents um 

75.84 76.43 B: (( [noise] )) 

86.70 94.31 A: didn't have computers growing up and and i've kinda grown up with them and they're no big thing to me but my parents are completely confused by them so 

94.00 96.10 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

94.73 104.52 A: um i think you know with as many computers as there are in society today you just about have to be educated on them you know and especially in order to compete in the future too 

104.41 116.02 B: definitely yeah i'd agree i think i [sigh] yeah i guess i guess i would i guess they have to [sigh] [noise] harm you know education in 

115.99 122.22 B: in some way with the personal stuff that you can only really learn you know especially 

122.36 123.71 B: like more 

123.94 127.40 B: if you talk about education with you know 

128.35 131.88 B: life experiences or or the more things that 

132.00 142.17 B: i mean you can only learn so much from a computer and it's only so interactive now and of course computers will get you know 

142.26 143.74 B: [noise] people 

144.02 152.05 B: will make computers smarter and and more and more interactive and all the rest but you can only learn really so much 

152.33 165.19 B: um about fundamentals and foundation and but i think once you have basics [noise] and once you you know understand what you're l- looking for and you have a good you know 

165.41 169.56 B: base you can learn a whole lot from them i mean 

169.57 171.34 B: i'm right now i'm 

171.79 175.92 B: figuring out how to build my own video projector 

175.56 176.61 A: [noise] oh wow 

176.15 179.77 B: and that's not really something i don't think i'd even 

180.27 190.72 B: i don't know if i'd like pick up a book and read that or or ask people to do that and it just seems really easy to you know go online and do a search for 

191.01 198.42 B: video projector like do it yourself video projectors and that's kind of what i did and so you know you get 

197.83 198.64 A: huh 

198.20 210.17 B: step by step and you you find out how to do it and you can order everything online and you know it's it it's a lot simpler than not having a computer so 

209.38 211.87 A: yeah i was gonna say that sounds pretty complicated 

212.04 222.81 B: yeah and it it is complicated but if you you know if you do one part at a time or whatever then it it's not nearly as complicated so i 

223.06 224.03 B: (( don't know )) 

223.52 225.11 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah i gotcha )) 

225.46 227.38 A: (( [noise] )) 

226.40 232.91 B: this is a this is a lot of time for this topic i think [noise] what other topics have you had 

232.74 238.53 A: um i had ah terrorism and how it's ah changed your life since nine eleven [noise] 

238.09 239.33 B: oh yeah 

238.54 241.18 A: the other day yeah i've only done one other call 

241.26 245.16 A: um but i guess you know kinda what i was thinking too i'm a 

245.57 258.11 A: um i'm a nursing student here and i've noticed it's really weird any more all the text books come not only with the text but also with you know c._d.s and c._d. roms and stuff any more 

257.99 258.91 B: wow 

258.25 259.27 A: um 

258.92 259.91 B: yeah 

259.29 263.54 A: you know for school and that's totally something different from what i was used to 

263.58 273.52 A: um i'm well thirty years old now so i'm kinda an adult student going back but um it's kinda surprising how much stuff's done with c._d. roms now 

274.29 276.34 B: [noise] yeah it is amazing 

275.57 277.40 A: it really is [noise] 

277.12 284.89 B: but i think the m- the major you know progress that they need to focus on is is making it more you know 

285.17 292.20 B: useful for people 'cause i was taking classes and and i graduated 

292.30 293.98 B: with my under grad 

294.15 301.16 B: just ah two years ago and they were using a lot of c._d.s with books as well but [noise] i mean 

302.92 315.65 B: if you don't really if you don't know where to start and you don't have somebody to talk to about you know starting out and somebody to to be very interactive then i don't think they're really useful at all 

314.60 324.80 A: yeah i well kinda what you were saying before too i think that you kinda have to i mean i think a person i don't think computers help wi- more with the fundamentals and that sort of stuff 

324.85 327.53 A: um you know i i think 

327.45 332.59 A: like with our our son and stuff i notice that almost all the toys anymore in the store 

332.44 346.99 A: have you know com- some sort of computer in them and ah just you know like the basic skills with building blocks and things like that um we're really tried to just get him some basic simple toys and things because you know i think that's 

336.00 336.87 B: mhm 

347.10 349.91 A: the best for everybody to start out with but ah 

349.37 351.25 B: yeah 

350.80 356.88 A: and i know sometimes the computer stuff he'll play with and then other times i think it's kind of a little above his head so 

356.73 359.38 B: yeah and i think another thing that might be 

359.50 361.84 B: a negative for you know 

362.74 368.18 B: being over re- dependent on computers is maybe you know how 

368.93 382.50 B: [mn] studies on kids that ah lose attention quickly and computers and flashy you know just technology in general faster faster quicker quicker 

374.15 375.06 A: sure 

382.70 387.19 B: and makes you kinda numb to a lot of surroundings i guess 

386.80 391.38 A: yeah well it takes i think it takes it too a lot of the human element out of 

391.60 395.83 A: you know and the interpersonal interaction and communication 

396.01 399.24 A: um you know when you're just staring at a computer screen 

399.07 400.24 B: yeah 

399.60 407.00 A: well plus the fact you i like at work whenever our computers go down i mean that's just awful 'cause you can't get anything done then you know 

406.39 407.90 B: yeah [laughter] 

407.31 411.63 A: so [laughter] it's kinda hard being um so reliant on them too 

411.40 413.14 B: what do you do for work 

412.56 418.18 A: um i work um as a temp for the state of nebraska processing medicaid claims 

418.17 419.03 B: cool 

418.77 428.39 A: so yeah it's you know it's something i work part time too for a a nursing home doing care type stuff but that's more just to get some experience in for the summer 

428.24 429.82 B: yeah 

428.44 436.71 A: um and what i'm doing with nursing school i plan on going and getting my masters in anesthesia when i'm done with this program so that's 

435.85 439.18 B: [noise] oh wow that sounds that sounds difficult [laughter] 

438.53 442.09 A: [laughter] um it's really hard to get into but ah 

442.10 449.50 A: right now they make the most money of of ah about everybody in the nursing field they start out making around a hundred thousand so 

448.89 456.12 B: isn't it also um the most ah highly ah litigated field in in medicine anesthesia 

454.80 469.50 A: um anesthesia is yeah um it has the highest the highest ah insurance rate for malpractice and stuff because i mean anytime during the operation somebody dies they just automatically assume you gave them you know too much anesthesia and that's about that so 

456.39 457.20 B: yeah 

467.60 471.36 B: [laughter] sure and i think it's also 

471.38 473.61 B: hard to tell you know 

474.23 482.68 B: i mean each person is different you can only tell so much from body weight and past it's kinda hard to predict how hm 

481.25 483.90 A: predict how things are gonna go that's right 

484.24 490.48 A: but ah you know it a lot of different i gu- it's not a real male dominated field so it's kinda hard to 

490.41 501.72 A: find an area where you really fit in um i went from i used to be a cop for about six years before that and i went from being a profession that was totally male dominated to one where 

501.44 502.67 B: [laughter] 

501.60 506.09 A: um in thirty four students there's two males and the rest are women so 

504.41 505.41 B: (( wow )) 

506.05 509.13 B: what made you ah go away from being a cop 

509.04 515.27 A: um i just got tired of it i i just got tired of dealing with people and and ah 

511.13 512.04 B: uh-huh 

515.35 520.76 A: um the pay's not all that good and it's really non productive to family life and 

520.95 527.52 A: um i was so happy to get out of it 'cause i you really start to get a negative view of your fellow man and [laughter] 

527.13 528.47 B: yeah i bet 

527.66 534.50 A: it's not a good thing to it's not a good thing to so you start hating the world and everybody in it and it's just not a good place to be so 

534.32 536.34 B: well good for you for getting out of it 

535.73 540.33 A: yeah i'm pretty happy um being out of it how 'bout you you married or 

540.21 542.99 B: though no no not married just 

541.48 543.92 A: [laughter] enjoying the single life then 

544.14 547.96 B: yeah yeah and ah yeah 

545.56 546.69 A: (( all right )) 

548.99 558.54 B: i i'm gonna go back to school starting in september for a m._b._a. and i work in finance so i'm just kind of 

553.25 554.08 A: (( are you )) 

555.29 556.60 A: oh wonderful 

558.97 561.10 B: doing the business thing right now 

560.96 562.02 A: i gotcha ah 

561.77 563.15 B: (( it's all right )) 

562.09 564.71 A: that's a good thing to have a head for nowadays 

564.42 567.12 B: yeah we'll see 

565.86 566.89 A: (( well i ah i )) 

567.09 569.94 A: think with the way the economy is going right now it's 

570.64 575.37 A: it's gonna be kinda hard to hard to go in in the future i think 

574.85 576.53 B: yeah i think so too 

579.62 582.33 A: yeah boy it's hard to talk for ten minutes straight 

579.99 580.55 B: (( [sigh] )) 

581.47 595.78 B: [laughter] well i mean my other topics i had the terrorism thing and talked to somebody in brooklyn who was there when it happened and i mean we filled that up pretty quick and this is my third one so the first one was on health and fitness and 

588.18 589.25 A: oh wow 

595.16 599.89 A: yeah i bet being from new york you guys probably are a little more familiar with that my wife and i
