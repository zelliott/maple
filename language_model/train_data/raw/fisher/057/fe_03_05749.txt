0.37 2.45 B: [noise] hi i'm dave 

1.72 4.12 A: hi i'm mark from philadelphia 

3.66 4.98 B: how's it going 

4.41 5.84 A: all right how are you 

5.32 6.70 B: pretty good 

6.10 7.55 A: (( yeah )) 

7.03 9.16 B: yeah are you a student 

9.07 12.64 A: no a former student but no longer and you 

11.72 12.81 B: no longer 

13.14 16.87 B: all right i'm a student in uh chapel hill down in north carolina 

16.28 17.27 A: right 

17.16 20.56 B: um [noise] it's not a bad topic 

19.79 21.77 A: undergraduate graduate or 

21.28 24.16 B: uh yeah undergrad senior year 

24.04 24.91 A: (( uh )) 

25.61 26.56 B: (( [noise] )) 

25.67 26.47 A: (( oh )) 

26.50 31.74 A: um when i was in college which was about ten years ago computers were just starting to uh 

32.33 42.31 A: make it's way i think my junior year which was ninety three i had my first email address but there were only so many people that actually had it 

33.44 34.64 B: right 

36.37 37.73 B: mhm 

40.44 41.35 B: right 

42.41 46.15 A: so and really a computer was just word processing and nothing else 

45.59 47.45 B: right it's really 

46.42 48.64 A: so i would be interested to hear 

48.99 57.13 B: yeah um [noise] well my freshman year was the first year that all freshmen had to have a computer 

56.73 58.02 A: (( right [noise] )) 

57.08 61.47 B: and if you didn't get one somewhere else you had to get it through the school which 

61.42 64.65 B: most students did especially because uh 

64.59 78.94 B: there were lots of educational loans and stuff like that they were given for 'em specifically so a lot of people got 'em for free or got 'em reduced or whatever and most people got we uh we basically had to all have laptops [noise] um 

66.77 68.60 A: (( mhm [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

79.22 91.64 B: and how much we use them really varies um the math faci- and the math and science departments now at most major universities use them a lot because chemistry labs and stuff like that can now be 

91.62 94.79 B: more automated like instead of having to 

94.81 105.22 B: take guestimations of amounts of liquid and stuff like that there are programs that can be run into the laptop and record the amounts more specifically um 

98.64 99.62 A: right 

105.32 110.13 B: there're also far more computer labs on campus than there used to be um 

110.67 121.70 B: there's one in almost every large dorm on campus there are eight or nine within different libraries and buildings nearly every department has one 

121.75 127.20 B: or two for t._a.s professors and students in that department 

126.94 127.81 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

127.43 135.47 B: um we use them every day uh the first thing you do at orientation is get your your password which lets you into 

135.55 140.75 B: online classroom websites which most classes have a website of some type 

140.72 151.34 B: um email which is basically a mandatory communication device now anything that the university needs to let us know they let us know through email um 

151.42 157.85 B: all of our grading is now online all of our class registration is now online 

158.51 159.55 B: um 

159.67 162.79 B: there's very little that's not billing 

163.13 171.54 B: there there is some like campus mail from occasion um most things like class registration can be done over the phone 

171.38 172.27 A: right 

171.66 177.28 B: but essentially everything is handled through the web um our network 

176.33 182.87 A: i actually did go down to u._n._c. a few years ago a friend of mine was getting his graduate degree there i did see the big labs they had and stuff 

180.37 181.28 B: mhm 

182.62 192.95 B: yeah there are there are some downsizing of that now that they really peaked last year or the year before that because now that every student has one 

183.29 184.16 A: (( so uh )) 

189.52 190.44 A: uh-huh 

192.87 203.10 B: with a uh a t. three network computer line in their room the the use of computers on campus is r- is cutting down 

196.07 197.04 A: right 

202.93 210.88 B: i think they are planning to keep the majority of small labs that don't have attendants that are used by professors and employees 

210.80 221.23 B: but the majority of the student run labs are being cut down specifically because printing is now a huge issue on campuses because yeah there are so many 

214.55 215.42 A: (( yep [mn] )) 

218.28 219.85 A: oh yeah the paper 

221.53 225.28 B: [noise] there are so many online documents [mn] that are um 

223.63 224.54 A: uh-huh 

225.40 229.57 B: like nearly any novel or uh 

230.01 244.42 B: text books almost anything can be found online and so there's a huge issue with students printing out hundreds and hundreds of pages of documents on a regular basis i know that our some of our computer labs print ten thousand pages an hour 

243.92 245.29 A: [noise] wow wow 

244.68 247.55 B: and do so on a regular basis 

247.58 248.57 B: so 

248.25 249.77 A: kills a lot of trees 

249.37 252.44 B: yeah that's a that's a lot of lot of trees 

252.13 258.80 A: actually when i went to law school my law school was one of the first to require each person to have a laptop but even then 

255.93 257.23 B: mhm 

259.01 270.14 A: they were still mainly using it just for word processing the web was kind of new there weren't very many legal websites out there so there wasn't much to do a couple of professors made their own websites but again [sigh] 

263.11 264.43 B: (( right [noise] [noise] )) 

270.20 272.39 A: there was nothing there special about them 

271.76 273.51 B: right we 

272.53 280.08 A: now my brother in law has got to go to college he'll be a freshman next year and we're dealing we're going to buy him a computer so he can talk about what he wants 

275.88 277.15 B: mhm 

280.33 283.24 A: and things he needs there's so much more than we ever needed 

282.48 289.33 B: [noise] yeah we definitely uh i don't know i don't really like the laptops my little brother went to state 

286.82 287.61 A: right 

289.37 298.53 B: and they didn't have an issue with desktops i think they even encouraged them so his computer is ten times what mine is and didn't even cost as much 

296.56 297.28 A: (( mm )) 

298.29 304.10 A: [noise] i like the laptop 'cause i like to take notes in class a what at the library or at the park so 

298.57 299.63 B: (( but um )) 

301.47 302.46 B: yeah 

303.77 304.86 B: yeah 

304.24 306.72 A: it allowed for a lot more flexibility [mn] 

306.09 316.90 B: that's true i like to i like to write my notes because i like to uh make a lot of like gestures and like drawings and circle things and stuff depending on what kind of class i'm taking 

313.59 314.44 A: uh-huh 

316.83 317.93 B: so 

317.69 332.44 B: a lot of that stuff i could do but the way i've had a lot of lecture classes in history and political science that are very high paced and i'd never be able to take the notes the way i want to i'm also just too nervous t- to carry mine around because i'm just 

331.23 333.06 A: right 

332.55 338.47 B: it rains so often on campus and stuff like that that you never know if you're going to do some damage to it so 

338.41 348.04 A: i don't think i also guess that email would allow you to talk to professors a lot easier than back in my day when you have to find them at their phone or at uh at their office 

338.57 339.48 B: (( i don't know )) 

345.67 358.24 B: [noise] right yeah office hours are a little bit less of a deal they they all have them but [noise] they're not there at their actual assigned times i think a lot more often than they used to probably because 

350.86 352.13 A: (( right [noise] )) 

358.33 366.36 B: a couple of students just after class tell him they have an ordeal and they'll talk to it [noise] or email 'em about it and so they won't go their office hours assuming that no one needs anything 

366.30 375.39 B: so it it is helpful it still we mostly use 'em like i mostly use mine for word processing i try to keep games and stuff like that off of it 'cause that's a distraction 

375.04 376.21 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

375.46 388.50 B: from work and mostly w- but but there are online like certain classes like introductory classes that are taught the same way every semester like info foreign languages often have quizzes or homework that you do online 

388.70 401.16 B: and i do have like a a little website that i built one day just out of because we have space a- at school to do it and i can put documents on there so that wherever i am if i need to look at something for class 

395.96 396.77 A: right 

401.03 411.82 B: or if i've made like a study guide and i want my friends to be able to get it it's a lot easier than emailing it out to everybody or just making hard copies and hoping i'll run into somebody so 

411.50 416.67 A: i think in retrospect what i'm most jealous about that if you want to research something you could sit at home and do it 

416.38 417.96 B: oh yeah definitely 

416.74 419.56 A: you know we had to run to the library and uh 

419.59 423.68 A: you know make sure the library was open and all that junk 

421.79 431.83 B: [noise] right yeah we we basically now just use the the libraries are just a big quiet space that that's pretty much all they function as no one 

427.87 428.84 A: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

431.94 435.77 B: i've checked out books but only two or three times 

435.57 450.30 B: and most of my friends have never actually checked out a book ever because even if there isn't an online copy of something [noise] most professors know that the two or three texts that they're not going to make you buy but it might be helpful 

450.19 462.65 B: they'll scan on the pages that are going to be helpful and put it on e-reserve so you do have to go to the library but it's just a bound you know set of pages [noise] that you can check out so 

462.66 474.03 B: even then you don't actually have to go find the book hunt it down and check it out and keep it it'll usually be limited to the pages that you need and they can make notes on them or whatever if they need to so 

474.03 487.97 B: yeah it definitely has changed the way research gets done you can definitely do a lot of your pre research without ever leaving the room and only going to make a couple of copies of the pages that you really need later on in the process 

481.28 482.16 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

488.17 490.31 A: that's pretty amazing to me [laughter] 

490.28 504.61 B: yeah there definitely freshman year simple papers for english classes and stuff you could definitely do without ever leaving the room and have multiple sources in different languages and everything if if need be so 

498.10 498.99 A: right 

504.80 519.09 B: there definitely is some huge things as far as that goes and information sharing with other universities as far as like duke and n._c. state and u._n._c. all share library resources and you know we don't 

507.64 508.44 A: (( [noise] )) 

517.76 524.21 A: [mn] you actually will say duke's name without you'll say duke's name without cursing or anything like that okay 

519.99 521.69 B: (( hm )) 

522.59 524.95 B: yeah you can uh 

525.06 535.78 B: [noise] yeah if we need a book and only duke has it i can request it online when i find out they're the only one that has it and they'll send it to our library for me to get in the next day or two 

528.12 528.90 A: (( [mn] mm )) 

535.71 540.83 B: so stuff like that being able to kind of double and triple your resources very simply 

540.49 541.62 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

540.74 552.45 B: just by connecting your library search engines and stuff like that that that's made a big difference i think as far as how much [noise] research have you done and how much collaboration there is between the two universities 

552.07 553.73 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

552.55 559.33 B: there are projects that have cropped up especially between caroline and dukes and we really are only twelve or thirteen miles away 

559.47 566.58 B: that now there are a lot of programs where students ride back and forth on buses taking classes at each taking online classes at the other 

566.56 578.27 B: or using an t- an advisor at another school to help them with a project if no one is quite as specialized in that area at our school but someone is somewhere else 

577.79 578.70 A: (( [noise] [noise] mm )) 

578.99 590.29 B: so there's a lot you don't have to transfer just to take classes at another school you know you can you can do it on the web or you can do it one day a week and it's a lot easier to make that happen now 

586.62 587.62 A: (( [noise] right )) 

590.24 599.78 B: with classes having websites online and so a a student taking a class at duke could access most of the class materials from their own room
