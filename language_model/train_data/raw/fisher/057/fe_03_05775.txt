0.46 2.32 A: hello how are you 

1.82 3.64 B: i'm doing well how are you 

3.44 5.59 A: good my name's chris who's this 

5.36 6.86 B: this is bryce 

6.74 8.29 A: hi bryce how are you 

8.44 9.66 B: i'm doing well 

9.45 17.57 A: good um so do you do you does your family live in the same city as you 

17.71 27.62 B: um actually right now i do live with um in the same city as my family i kinda moved back to my home town to do to work um 

28.43 35.58 B: this is a a rather i don't know difficult topic to talk about today um i don't know did you want to go first 

35.54 36.42 A: sure 

36.35 37.28 B: okay 

37.28 42.24 A: um do you wanna ask me a question or should i just start talking or 

42.24 46.54 B: um i guess you could just start talking and maybe i can gather some thoughts from there 

45.46 48.00 A: [mn] all right um 

48.09 54.21 A: that it's an interesting question i mean the question was what does family mean to you um 

56.17 60.79 A: i think i mean there's the obvious there's our our blood relations 

61.09 62.79 A: and um 

63.71 75.84 A: you know i have a very very close relationship with my family my family's very important to me um i'm lucky to have a large family so i think that i have a very 

76.29 78.63 A: [sigh] classical 

78.69 83.24 A: sort of sense of family in the sense that um 

83.66 98.02 A: you know i don't come from a divorced household um i think i have a pretty sort of traditional sense of family on another level [mn] i don't live in the same city as my family um so 

98.98 104.13 A: family also means the extended network of friends 

104.16 106.93 A: and others who 

107.27 111.88 A: i relate to and who support me on a daily basis 

112.16 113.47 A: um 

113.48 121.94 A: and i would consider them family on a in a different way but on a in a equally important way 

122.05 124.42 A: does that make sense do you feel similarly mhm 

123.39 131.51 B: um i mean on that i'd tot- that totally makes sense and and i agree with that because you know i've lived in other cities um 

131.56 134.96 B: um especially when i was living in atlanta um 

135.67 144.39 B: my friends were were basically my family um i've got i do come from a divorced household my parents were divorced when i was in fifth grade 

144.55 145.63 B: um 

145.81 147.97 B: so um 

148.11 151.80 B: i don't know i guess this is kinda what makes the topic difficult for me 

150.37 152.04 A: (( mhm mm mm mhm )) 

152.00 153.15 B: um 

153.49 160.72 B: my father and i we're not close after the divorce um i guess because i chose that i had to be cl- there for my mother 

160.75 167.23 B: um therefore i just kinda chose the role of you know not having anything to do with my father 

166.79 168.50 A: mhm 

167.36 170.91 B: um so i was i was there for my mom 

171.29 182.87 B: um but my family has been very very supportive of me um growing up you know i wasn't always the best kid on the block and and they were always there to support me um and then 

183.16 184.20 B: um 

184.60 186.14 B: (( you know i i )) 

186.26 195.73 B: am also homosexual so when i came out of the closet um when i was seventeen um i guess 

188.13 189.08 A: uh-huh 

196.15 197.31 B: (( it was )) 

197.72 202.43 B: yeah that made it to where it was [mn] really more comfortable for me um 

202.74 206.33 B: to express my my homosexuality because 

206.44 210.41 B: um they were okay with it they weren't condemning um 

209.96 211.79 A: they were supportive 

210.99 214.81 B: they were very supportive ah my my 

215.60 221.89 B: my [mn] expression i won't say my choice because i don't think it that it was actually a choice that i made 

222.02 223.15 B: um 

222.53 224.95 A: uh-huh so then um 

224.98 230.77 A: did you did you were you still living at home after you came out or did you move away or mhm mhm 

228.93 233.89 B: at the time i was seventeen so i was still living um at the time i was living with my mother 

234.12 238.47 B: um so i came out as i was living with my mother um 

238.99 243.20 B: but you know my my dad knew my mom knew 

243.15 256.16 B: um even my dad and i still had contact with each other when we still lived in the same town um and we saw each other you know probably on a daily basis but you know he just at the time wasn't my favorite person in the world 

256.74 261.62 B: um you know what family means to me today is you know [sigh] 

261.69 264.61 B: hopefully to most people 

265.41 267.98 B: that's where they get their set of values 

267.66 269.27 A: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

268.24 273.58 B: from is from their their family that's not so true um 

273.95 275.00 B: today 

274.84 275.78 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

275.21 279.82 B: um a lot of people come from broken homes um 

279.94 282.78 B: and and aren't raised in 

283.81 285.67 B: [sigh] in the best of environments 

286.13 287.30 B: um 

287.98 289.53 B: so i think today 

290.85 298.41 B: what family means to people um has definitely changed than what it has been in the past 

299.16 301.33 A: do you think um 

301.89 312.39 A: that we were both sort of talking about having an extended network outside of the family do you think that your sort of network of friends 

312.56 313.66 A: has 

313.88 315.46 A: (( become )) 

317.21 324.74 A: has is fulfilling the role of family for you equally or more than your blood family mhm 

325.40 335.17 B: [mn] [mn] um i would have to say so because i have my network of friends really understand me a lot more than my family does um 

335.15 340.45 B: because my you know also well there were some other problems growing up um 

341.45 353.28 B: you know as i was growing up and and trying to deal with my sexuality and who i was i also turned to drugs and alcohol for support and and so you 

349.41 351.26 A: (( mhm uh-huh mhm )) 

353.60 354.43 B: (( know [mn] )) 

354.38 358.08 B: to recover i kinda i got involved in a twelve step group 

357.87 372.60 B: and a lot of my friends are in recovery um and so basically they're my extended family um and you know noone really understands another alcoholic or an addict than another alcoholic or [mn] or an addict 

363.91 364.77 A: (( mm mhm )) 

372.60 374.03 B: so um 

374.76 379.64 B: yeah they really offer me more support than my family can because you know they 

380.12 393.30 B: you know if i come home and or or talk about it to my family you know it kinda them off ah you know they just don't understand um but yet i could do that with um you know somebody in a twelve step group 

392.88 398.66 A: [sigh] so we'd maybe we might say that family 

399.11 401.87 A: is someone who 

402.63 404.85 A: (( understands )) 

404.94 416.13 A: where we're coming from not just on a sympathetic level but on a true level of understanding maybe based on similar personal experience 

416.55 419.55 A: and also understands us 

419.97 423.22 A: um without judgement 

422.21 424.36 B: right exactly 

423.67 426.31 A: maybe that's how we would define 

426.45 429.99 A: family or what we would like family to be 

429.82 436.72 B: yeah i think that's what we would like family to be but that's not always the case unfortunately um i think 

437.65 440.61 B: i would have to say for my parents um 

440.68 445.35 B: they did the best that they could and and they continue to do the best that they can 

445.48 449.85 B: with i guess what they were taught growing up and what they know 

450.26 451.42 B: um 

452.92 454.00 B: (( you know )) 

454.88 460.42 B: i guess you know it's passed down from generation to generation to generation if 

461.52 468.83 B: you know had they become an alcoholic or an addict in their lifetime they would understand but they're not so 

468.95 470.15 B: um 

470.83 475.92 B: you know i can't hold it against them that they don't understand what i went through 

475.76 477.78 A: mhm 

476.34 478.09 B: you know so 

478.53 485.35 B: i can't hold it against them basically i'm content with just saying that they did the best that they can and they have 

485.78 486.95 B: um 

487.00 495.45 B: [mn] same with you know the homosexual issue i couldn't ask for them to have treated me any better or accepted me any better than they have 

495.76 496.81 B: um 

498.03 501.39 B: because that's something i i i struggled with for years 

500.82 502.43 A: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

501.44 508.77 B: for years um [mn] and you know they couldn't have made it any easier for me 

508.95 515.70 B: but it's unfortunate that not everyone has the family support that i'm fortunate to have 

516.10 517.74 A: [mn] [mn] so 

518.10 528.44 A: it seems like maybe there's there's three criteria that i'm getting out of this conversation that would sort of create a condition of family it seems like there's 

528.61 532.36 A: there's an m- someone whose family is someone who 

532.41 535.33 A: understands from personal experience 

535.62 538.63 A: (( two someone who )) 

539.67 544.58 A: doesn't judge us along with that understanding and three 

544.71 549.89 A: somebody who gives us a sense of belonging maybe 

549.72 550.86 B: right 

550.27 552.19 A: and also um 

551.97 554.37 B: and love you unconditionally you know 

553.42 556.07 A: somebody who makes us feel comfortable 

555.47 563.36 B: right yeah and somebody that's there to love you unconditionally and and really give you that understanding 

559.71 560.46 A: (( mm mm )) 

564.50 566.14 B: [mn] as best they can 

566.54 571.67 B: um is very very important in in in my opinion 

571.57 577.05 A: [mn] do you think that your i know that in my own personal experience i feel like my 

577.53 580.33 A: blood relations 

582.07 585.24 A: (( over time )) 

585.99 598.03 A: i think there are certain things we'll never be able to really understand i think that they do gain deeper levels of understanding even if it's slow do you feel like that also 

596.28 597.20 B: right 

597.71 599.92 B: yeah i i i would have to say that
