36.47 39.34 A: (( yeah ah same for me [lipsmack] u- um )) 

38.31 39.85 B: (( y- yeah [sigh] )) 

39.83 48.66 A: but i i know a guy who does this who has been paid so ah a- apparently it's on the up and up [sigh] so a- ah so what countries are you worried about 

44.56 45.68 B: oh sweet u- 

48.19 50.26 B: um 

50.28 55.61 B: [sigh] less so countries rather than factions within our own country b- 

55.25 57.21 A: [sigh] [laughter] [noise] 

56.34 61.67 B: but maybe that's just me no i'm not that worried um 

61.88 63.30 B: obviously 

63.87 65.00 B: you know 

65.06 66.42 B: north korea u- 

66.51 67.78 B: (( um [sigh] )) 

68.82 72.70 B: you know a lot of people worry about china but i personally am not um [lipsmack] 

73.41 77.79 B: and then you know obviously the middle eastern countries but [sigh] they really don't have 

78.00 79.76 B: they really don't have any sort of u- 

80.24 81.32 B: um 

81.37 83.79 B: army tech- technology to 

83.88 88.11 B: even come close to really hurting us in like a t- traditional war time sense 

88.36 92.52 B: [sigh] obviously terrorism is a factor but you know 

92.87 97.43 B: at least formally and officially it won't be state sponsored so 

98.08 109.76 A: [mn] [noise] [sigh] [mn] well and i actually i agree with everything you've said so far because u- um [lipsmack] you know right in the midst of a- all of our upheaval of course north korea was posing a threat and i think [sigh] 

109.56 113.54 A: somewhere along the line they're c- crazy enough to do something [sigh] ah 

112.61 113.55 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

114.05 117.16 B: well and they have they have the c- capability they have the technology 

114.06 114.87 A: (( you know )) 

117.10 121.65 A: yeah [mn] yeah and they're um you know i mean they and they can reach the united states 

118.11 119.21 B: and the army 

121.81 122.64 B: yeah 

122.79 136.94 A: [sigh] [lipsmack] so um yeah yeah i mean i i would say yes as far as a country [sigh] that's probably somebody we should worry about and likewise at least right now i don't really see a major concern with c- china i mean i think we're okay with china 

130.89 132.05 B: yeah 

136.87 137.78 B: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

137.15 151.94 A: [sigh] but ah y- y- you know a- a- then as you pointed out you've go to the middle east [sigh] you know it isn't necessarily the country that w- we're worried about in my opinion ah but as you stated you know kind of f- factions within these countries u- 

151.36 152.30 B: (( mm [sigh] )) 

152.39 153.64 A: (( um [sigh] )) 

153.92 156.88 A: o- osama bin laden being a good example 

157.52 165.42 A: [mn] a- ah y- y- you know i agree w- with what you're saying that they don't really have the wherewithal to launch an assault [sigh] 

157.64 158.48 B: yeah 

165.56 172.16 A: on u._s. soil in terms of you know a full blown war b- backed by a country [sigh] but [sigh] 

171.87 172.81 B: (( yeah u- )) 

172.54 182.35 A: you know you get some of these guys like ah osama bin laden who obviously has the financial wherewithal to pull off some of the stuff that he's done [sigh] and um you know that certainly worries me 

179.66 180.60 B: (( um )) 

183.48 184.75 B: yeah i mean 

185.05 187.32 B: (( [mn] i don't know i don't think i worry about it that much but )) 

187.84 188.92 B: who knows 

189.63 191.64 B: (( [sigh] i don't know um [sigh] )) 

192.39 193.53 B: what else a- 

195.14 197.97 B: (( ah gosh [sigh] u- um )) 

196.69 197.77 A: [sigh] i don't know 

197.83 207.15 A: y- you know i don't i i don't really y- y- you know as far as any other countries [sigh] i don't i i really don't feel i have a concern [sigh] 

207.10 221.43 A: for any of these other countries you know i mean i i'm really not concerned about russia i mean they're not financially stable to do anything [sigh] and ah you know germany i'm not really worried about them i mean i ah y- you know it's i [sigh] i really 

214.10 215.08 B: (( uh-hum )) 

220.04 221.63 B: germany doesn't have an army 

221.62 226.79 A: y- y- yeah well that's what i mean i mean i'm not i'm not really concerned about germany [sigh] and ah [sigh] 

223.48 224.22 B: [laughter] 

227.96 228.62 B: (( uh-hum )) 

228.03 240.76 A: [mn] b- but again it's some of these guys in the mid east that ah y- y- you know [sigh] y- y- i mean i obviously based on our conversation you're not really too worried about osama bin laden but [sigh] you know he's done substantial damage to 

242.19 254.08 A: a quite a number of people and c- certainly you know a a couple of buildings in in new york city [sigh] so it's that kind of stuff that i i feel like i'm more w- worried about but again way back to the beginning of the conversation 

254.77 259.11 A: [sigh] korea i mean that's [noise] you know that could certainly be a problem [sigh] [noise] 

259.10 260.72 B: (( yeah um [sigh] [mn] y- )) 

262.61 265.22 B: yeah i mean they're sort of [sigh] 

265.91 267.03 B: they're treating 

267.10 281.37 B: i don't know all this is like economics in my opinion [sigh] they're treating china a lot differently than they t- treated [sigh] other countries like russia and it seems to be working [sigh] like they're slowly democratizing becoming more friendly [sigh] 

281.51 284.53 B: and it's because of y- you know 

284.64 297.99 B: mostly their nation status because [sigh] opening reducing trade barriers um [sigh] opening up free markets to their goods and services [sigh] and it's like i don't know why they don't 

298.60 304.94 B: [sigh] i i mean k- korea's more hostile and they're certainly less willing to cooperate and they also don't have as much 

305.39 308.48 B: to offer the u._s. but t- they seem to 

308.65 311.62 B: i don't know t- the u._s. foreign policy seems to [sigh] 

312.01 316.01 B: turn its back on north korea and and like look at them more of an enemy than 

316.43 321.20 B: maybe they o- or which may o- only provoking them into becoming an enemy does that make sense 

321.33 333.21 A: [noise] [sigh] yeah i i yeah i understand exactly what you're saying but i think that [sigh] [lipsmack] y- you know that i i can't even think of his name but the um the their leader over there [noise] [sigh] a- ah just really seems to me y- 

331.99 334.14 B: (( kim jong yeah [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

333.41 336.74 A: yeah i mean i i mean he seems to me to be [sigh] 

336.78 341.21 A: y- you know kind of on the edge if you will you know what i mean h- he's one of these guys who [sigh] 

341.45 348.26 A: i real y- y- you know it's kind of like you can't read him what is he going to do next you know you just h- h- he seems to me to wacko enough 

348.29 351.27 A: (( [sigh] to ah p- perhaps )) 

351.59 354.16 A: try to do something of course you know i mean 

353.02 354.05 B: (( [sigh] yeah [noise] )) 

354.13 367.02 A: and and may maybe as you're pointing out [laughter] maybe [laughter] in the end result it would be provoked by us [sigh] but ah [lipsmack] you know he he seems a little unstable t- to me i guess that's the best word that i'm looking for you know he seems a little unstable to me like [sigh] 

366.95 371.10 A: you know anything's liable to set him off and then he's ah god knows what he's going to do 

371.10 374.20 B: [noise] [sigh] yeah i'm not sure that i mean the 

374.36 377.10 B: nu- nu- nuclear weapon thing is [sigh] 

377.73 380.17 B: s- sort of scary but it's also [sigh] 

380.94 385.80 B: [noise] when everyone has 'em [noise] y- they're really [noise] unlikely to use 'em [noise] 

386.76 388.16 B: you know [noise] 

389.24 390.51 B: (( [mn] are you there )) 

390.48 393.54 A: yeah yeah i'm just t- thinking about what you're thinking but 

392.19 401.83 B: like the only time in history it's been used was no one else had 'em [lipsmack] so now [noise] they have like a few nuclear weapons [sigh] we have several hundred 

396.08 396.87 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

402.17 409.27 B: [sigh] so i i i'm not afraid of that like i'm not that doesn't make me nervous at all [sigh] they're more likely to use it 

409.28 416.25 B: on south korea [sigh] or something i mean we would most likely respond [noise] you know as ah south korea's an ally [sigh] 

416.36 420.36 B: but there'd be more political obstacles t- to overcome you know [sigh] i 

419.89 421.98 A: (( yeah [sigh] like [sigh] )) 

420.57 423.80 B: mean they're more likely to they won't in my opinion they w- [sigh] 

424.75 431.29 B: ah if a nuclear attack happens in my lifetime it will not be by [sigh] a nation state [sigh] 

432.23 443.95 A: [mn] well and i agree with what you're saying is that y- you know some of these countries have a few [sigh] weapons at their disposal where obviously we have m- many more and certainly the wherewithal to [sigh] 

443.90 448.20 A: ah deposit them w- w- w- where we feel they n- need to go 

447.98 459.54 A: [sigh] um and i just had a thought process process about that w- whole thing [sigh] you know i guess and and here it is [sigh] i i think one of the things that really worries me [mn] is um [lipsmack] 

459.79 472.39 A: you know we have soldiers in so many places now you know [sigh] and and you know now we're talking about africa and you know god knows what's going to be next and it's kind of like 

462.61 463.17 B: (( [sigh] )) 

464.38 465.84 B: (( [sigh] [sigh] uh-hum )) 

466.91 467.47 B: (( [sigh] )) 

469.36 470.72 B: (( [noise] )) 

472.61 486.34 A: y- y- what worries me is getting if if we if we get ourselves spread so thin you know i mean we've got soldiers here we've got soldiers there we've got 'em all over the place [sigh] and if somebody really decides to mount an attack somehow or some way that's what bothers me 

486.82 488.22 B: (( [sigh] [noise] [noise] well )) 

486.88 491.80 A: you know it's kind of like we we're out taking care of everybody else's country we're not taking care of our own you know 

492.46 498.28 B: [sigh] well i am worried about that but for a different reason u- u- um [sigh] 

498.49 507.81 B: not spreading ourselves t- thin and you know lowering our defenses or spreading you know so to say [sigh] but more so just we're just perpetuating the negative 

508.45 520.88 B: image of america across the world i mean i just spent [sigh] ah i just spent s- six months in europe a- and things are not so good over there i mean it was during the war [sigh] huge anti american protests in every country i went to [sigh] 

520.97 525.12 B: and you know the the military force 

525.33 529.10 B: is ubiquitous and it's [sigh] you know 

529.33 537.20 B: a little bit oppressive to a lot of the people of different countries [sigh] i mean if you lived in the phillipines and you know you have 

537.43 543.55 B: american bases at your back you know i mean the phillipines a- are not really anti american but [noise] 

543.57 545.69 B: [sigh] or even germany you know [sigh] 

545.37 547.32 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] uh-hum )) 

546.28 557.99 B: and they're sort of like well we're a developed country you know we're capable of [sigh] you know ruling ourselves and yet you still have this mil- military presence in germany [sigh] and there's still a huge military presence in germany by the u._s. 

554.90 555.75 A: yeah 

558.49 562.04 A: [sigh] whe- where were you and and whe- where were you when you were in europe

563.82 565.64 B: [sigh] but i travelled all around [sigh] 

565.49 570.17 A: [noise] uh-hum [noise] i mean that's what i figured if you were over there f- for six months you must have ah [sigh] 

570.36 574.52 A: b- been able to to ah get around to ah a number of the countries over there 

574.31 575.50 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

576.40 579.32 B: i mean it was pretty fierce in some countries 

576.44 577.36 A: so wh- 

579.03 580.31 A: (( uh-hum [noise] )) 

580.33 583.95 B: you know i had a witness to everything first hand by just reading the papers and stuff 

583.91 585.54 A: yeah 

584.18 587.25 B: also but there were huge protests in spain
