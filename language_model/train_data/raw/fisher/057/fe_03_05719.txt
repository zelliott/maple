34.73 36.45 A: why am i not sure i don't know 

36.50 40.69 A: [noise] 'cause it seems like in the past this country sort of like 

42.69 46.80 A: made a big to do about things that turn out to not be very big 

46.99 51.37 A: and so i'm not exactly trusting what i'm being told in the media these days 

50.71 61.86 B: [noise] i mean i agree with you to a certain degree but like there are [noise] people who hate us like i'm a muslim american [noise] and i'm totally anti war 

56.68 57.61 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

61.41 62.52 A: yes 

61.77 72.39 B: see and i wouldn't support bush going out there like you know iraq or somewhere 'cause i know his goal isn't good i know that iraq's not a huge threat 

63.22 64.82 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

72.39 82.95 B: (( but you know like somewhere like i mean you're right it's so true now that i'm thinking about it i don't really know who is r- )) 

83.10 85.93 B: (( i just wish they would tell the truth )) 

85.77 87.33 A: (( [noise] yeah i know )) 

86.48 97.27 B: but i know that will never happen till like the second revolution or something like something big happens [noise] or until there is extreme reforms in our government 

97.31 99.18 A: yeah 

98.12 100.84 B: (( [noise] [noise] i know that's not gonna happen in my lifetime )) 

100.26 101.13 A: [laughter] 

101.91 104.13 A: i don't know i mean there's some crazy stuff going on 

104.17 106.55 A: but it seems also like there's 

106.83 109.42 A: just not really 

109.51 114.95 A: a way to be able to be to even know the truth there's just so much going on i mean it's like 

114.87 125.96 A: go to france and then try and get news on what's actually going on in your neighborhood in america you know i mean you're gonna get so many different things but it's not all gonna be from the same area 

119.87 121.94 B: so yeah 

125.74 137.56 B: like a new californian tends to be a quote very thoroughly like liberal state so what's like the part of california are you from how out there 

132.51 134.25 A: yeah 

137.10 138.56 A: i'm in los angeles 

138.49 141.53 B: okay so it's pretty like liberal yeah 

141.17 142.93 A: yeah 

141.66 144.93 B: (( the l._a. times is a pretty good newspaper for )) 

144.56 149.87 A: well it's also [sigh] [noise] i mean it depends on where in los angeles you're from 

148.99 150.74 B: (( the people yeah )) 

150.01 153.53 A: and where you live like i moved out here from the mid west so 

153.20 155.36 B: (( oh what part of the mid west )) 

154.90 155.90 A: michigan 

155.77 157.23 B: oh wow ye- 

156.53 158.82 A: yeah so 

159.34 165.75 A: like i can see areas in california that and even in los angeles that are a lot more conservative than 

165.90 172.49 A: the place in michigan that i came from um but there's also areas that are just no comparison between i 

167.72 169.36 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

172.74 175.94 A: guess night and day with how liberal it is 

176.00 178.74 B: what part of michigan are you from 

178.13 179.24 A: gunruthers 

179.82 184.37 B: okay so you're not from like near like or anything 

183.73 186.43 A: no other side of the state 

184.39 187.52 B: or little muslim america 

186.93 188.63 A: yeah 

188.13 189.12 B: okay 

189.91 194.85 B: 'cause like is like a really fairly liberal area 

193.86 197.59 A: yeah and much of michigan is really conservative 

197.34 205.38 B: yeah it's funny 'cause ann arbor correct me if i'm wrong but ann arbor's sort of like 

205.55 209.31 B: part of western michigan am i correct 

208.29 212.04 A: no ann arbor's towards detroit so it's still eastern michigan 

211.79 214.22 B: [noise] okay so it's eastern michigan 

216.89 222.28 B: that's very interesting 'cause there's like so many racist militias are from there and like and no 

220.60 222.46 A: yeah yeah [laughter] 

222.45 230.96 B: like in the topic we're supposed to be talking about which countries are like terrorism like which countries do we consider to be terrorists 

230.75 242.63 B: [noise] but like the most ironic thing about this topic is the fact that there's terrorists in our very own country and they're not muslim and they're not arabs they're like you know white europeans like 

241.60 243.85 A: [noise] right 

242.95 253.27 B: they're militias i mean militias are some of the biggest threats in the united states i mean the oklahoma city bombing i mean that was proof they're like you know 

253.43 256.89 B: that we don't have that crap under control 

256.27 257.89 A: yeah 

258.42 261.09 A: ah i think that 

261.35 274.32 A: trying to say that this country is a threat is a total misnomer because it's not the country it's like some small little offshoot group that that country probably even disowns 

267.75 269.09 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

273.74 281.51 B: [noise] exactly that's the whole thing that was the whole thing about nine eleven how we invaded afghanistan you know i mean 

280.42 282.17 A: yeah 

281.31 290.06 B: if they'd really [noise] i mean i can see afghanistan [noise] to a certain degree how the justification even though i was anti war 

290.17 291.04 B: too 

291.30 292.07 B: um 

292.73 299.70 B: i can see how bush could persuade the american public to go like yes [noise] let's go to war with this country 

299.50 309.51 B: 'cause i mean there was direct links you know the taliban was really bad but like iraq iraq was a little bit of a stretch and that's the whole weapons for [noise] mass 

309.34 318.63 A: right yeah i think iraq was much more of a stretch it i mean it's like we're gonna tell you this but we're not gonna show you how we know this or why we think this 

317.49 321.98 B: destruction what they did show it was all lies but it er 

322.18 324.35 B: like the whole satellite photos 

324.73 325.74 B: like 

324.91 330.40 A: yeah but you know take a silo and turn it on its side and it looks like a bomb you 

326.26 327.83 B: (( [mn] i mean )) 

330.29 343.10 B: yeah like exactly that's the whole point that i was like for like people who are really scared like in american public you know they're just gonna look at it and go like oh man they have bombs 

343.30 347.53 A: know yeah they're gonna see a little arrow pointing to it that says missile 

343.64 344.52 B: (( discovered )) 

347.38 348.96 B: (( yeah )) 

347.80 351.10 A: missile launch pad you know and it's like 

351.30 356.02 A: i don't know where that picture's from that could that picture could be from arizona 

356.22 367.53 B: exactly it's funny how even most conservative people people who tend to be anti government [noise] they're like always praising the homeland security department 

356.26 357.18 A: you know 

367.48 376.24 B: like um tom rich came to my town and he gave um thumbs up to cincinnati and told cincinnati they were 

371.38 372.99 A: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

376.04 390.04 B: prepared for terrorism but it's like there's nothing that's been done in our city like our mayor charlie lukens here like i said like he was asking congress and stuff for more money tom rich is 

389.94 394.33 B: an idiot it's it's just bizarre it's like 

394.21 408.35 B: they're not really lying to the american people any more the american people are upset it's like sometimes i feel as if they should be lying to me if they're like just outright being stupid like you know what i mean 

407.96 409.80 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

409.16 414.03 B: (( like it's a really bizarre feeling it's like i know that )) 

411.89 413.59 A: sometimes i think like 

414.01 424.88 A: the biggest threat to this country is not from the outside it's from the inside because there's so many people who are just willing to follow like sheep they're not thinking for themselves and they're not willing to actually 

421.21 422.92 B: (( yeah )) 

425.37 429.89 A: read offshoot magazines or newspapers that aren't gonna tell what the says 

430.44 434.78 B: yeah like um for example in um columbia there was some mobs 

434.96 435.95 B: that was 

437.03 440.98 B: broken into and people tore a whole bunch of 

441.02 441.98 A: wow 

441.64 455.32 B: (( em which is crazy 'cause like all these people bush may not have said for them to do this but they're like don't scoop out the enemy i mean it's just like when the whole anti french )) 

455.09 465.33 B: sentiment thing started back up like in cincinnati it was huge 'cause this city is like the second most conservative city in the nation 

464.62 466.35 A: (( [noise] right yeah )) 

465.16 476.91 B: but like because we have such a huge german [noise] population and a huge russian population in cincinnati there is no anti german sentiment anti russian 

477.09 478.54 B: (( sentiment um )) 

478.06 482.73 A: right well that's 'cause we've already been to war to last hundred years [laughter] 

480.83 481.60 B: yeah 

482.50 492.68 B: but other parts of like the nation where there's not a huge german population the anti german population the anti german sentiment was bigger 

492.99 505.95 B: but the thing is that the germans should um represent a larger part of the ethnic um percentage of caucasians in america i mean donald rumsfeld's german 

505.82 507.14 A: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

506.26 510.87 B: (( american i mean there's so many things german american so many famous german )) 

510.78 511.40 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

511.04 517.85 B: jews or just regular germans in our government and in our media i mean 

518.46 523.92 B: it's a- it's like if you make fun whereas there's not many french american 

523.94 529.63 B: (( like you know what i mean like i mean you can very few people you name are famous french american )) 

530.67 543.73 B: and so it's not like you're gonna have many french americans going like oh we can't believe you'd say that i mean the most famous french american i know of is er jackie kennedy that 

543.34 544.35 A: it's who 

544.34 545.57 B: jackie kennedy 

547.78 550.13 B: jackie kennedy 

549.22 553.08 A: yeah i'm trying to think if i know of any living ones ahah 

553.58 555.71 B: i know the guy who wrote um 

555.89 562.11 B: ah what's that one comic strip doonsbury his last name is trudeau 

563.52 564.83 B: (( [noise] gu trudeau )) 

564.90 566.91 B: is a french american 

567.32 572.99 B: (( and the funny thing is it's like a lot of people keep saying his like cartoon strip to be )) 

572.93 582.69 B: (( liberal but it's like the thing is it's like he was pro war well he was just pointing out all this stuff like i mean there's people who are pro war )) 

582.78 589.75 B: who have mixed up the reasons for being pro war like they're just like [noise] well there's so much u- uncertainty 

590.30 592.17 B: (( they said the people )) 

592.20 599.89 B: (( war those people i can't accept their reasons but i mean i have my reasons for being )) 

596.88 597.75 A: yeah
