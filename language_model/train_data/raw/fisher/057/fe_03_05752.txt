0.06 1.79 A: hello this is john 

1.74 3.97 B: hey i'm also john [laughter] 

3.34 4.34 A: hey john 

4.69 5.98 B: (( [laughter] hi )) 

4.82 8.74 A: (( so i guess the subjects about ah computers and education )) 

8.14 10.17 B: yeah 

9.85 13.61 A: well you know i i think it's kind of a mixed bag myself because if ah 

13.75 20.12 A: they can help a lot but they can also hinder in that they you know you take away a lot of the personalization of a regular teacher 

20.29 23.35 B: yeah i found it in in my case that it's probably been 

23.73 24.80 B: i'm sorry 

24.51 25.93 A: that's okay go ahead 

25.88 38.44 B: ah in my case it's probably been great for me i think in the like the classes i take is that you can get information online easily and that you know at like using email is wonderful for just you know talking between students and the teacher 

38.10 50.24 A: yes i agree with that one i'm i'm in college and it's like ah the same thing i can communicate with my teacher at almost any time whereas before computers i it would i'd have to wait till class almost or go take a trip to his office or something 

49.68 51.03 B: yeah [noise] 

50.50 57.49 A: so it does it does help a lot plus ah there is like a lot of information you can get too and when doing reports and stuff 

57.19 63.53 B: yeah i think i think our growing up with computers is as well i i we don't really know the other side of it [laughter] 

63.43 67.46 A: yes well you know i'm like almost forty years old and so when i was a kid we 

66.79 68.12 B: oh okay 

67.53 71.67 A: didn't we didn't have computers and so you had to use the encyclopedia and go to the library 

71.89 73.05 A: so ah 

72.80 77.12 B: yeah i haven't checked out a book in at least five years i'd say [laughter] 

75.31 83.28 A: [laughter] that's very cool yeah i haven't [laughter] i guess the closest i get is buying them on on the internet 

78.62 79.63 B: [laughter] 

80.40 82.18 B: yeah 

83.45 87.26 A: i don't really take them out either it's almost like renting them then i'd rather just buy them on the internet 

87.82 90.27 B: you buy your books on the int- the internet 

87.96 88.91 A: (( you know like )) 

89.74 92.77 A: yeah i i buy my school books and stuff on the internet 

92.38 95.62 B: ah that's cool i have actually have a website where i sell books [laughter] 

94.30 96.89 A: oh really ooh oh 

95.84 98.57 B: yeah at ah university of michigan 

98.35 101.16 A: okay yeah i'm out in california 

100.58 102.05 B: oh okay cool 

101.62 106.96 A: yeah [sigh] i i think that computers are they do aid in education a lot um 

106.85 121.49 A: i just i guess my only fear would be that some some schools would rely so heavily upon them that they couldn't you know they'd increase the class sizes and you get people sitting around you know on computers all day and only have one teacher per fifty kids on computers or something like that to try to save money 

114.19 116.15 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

120.65 125.10 B: yeah do you think they do that because of computers or do you think they d- do that anyway 

125.32 126.91 A: to save money 

126.37 128.27 B: yeah 

127.06 135.90 A: um well they didn't have computers and they couldn't i don't think they can get away with it but with computers they probably they probably could get away with it and everyone just sit around there on the computer 

135.55 140.78 B: yeah i've had some ah classes where there's been about you know four hundred people in a lecture 

136.84 137.55 A: (( um )) 

140.56 141.59 A: yes 

140.99 146.69 B: and it seems like i think it seems like they've always done that regardless of whether there was were computers or not so 

146.65 152.93 A: i think i'm i'm thinking more of like i guess in the way of um of grammar school you 

152.67 155.11 B: oh okay yeah 

153.00 164.34 A: know k. k. to twelve 'cause yeah i know when i went to u._c._s._e. it was the same way there were some classes had like three or four hundred people in them and like calculus gosh it was like a big auditorium 

163.93 166.03 B: yeah i could i could see that [noise] 

166.10 177.35 A: [sigh] but um yeah with with with um k. to twelve that would be i would be concerned for my children's well being if they get a good education if if a school district repli- relies too heavily upon 

177.60 188.23 A: using computers to teach them so i guess it just needs to be kinda watched to make sure that it's done correctly if it's done in the right blend you know if you've if you use computers the right way they are a big aid 

188.09 199.75 B: yeah do you think it puts anybody at a disadvantage as well just like people that can't afford computers so then you know when they go to into work or you know college or whatever that they're like if they went to a poorer school maybe they don't have as good of a chance 

200.20 203.32 A: yeah i guess that could yes i could see that if 

203.46 207.95 A: if it's kinda tough now though because computers are so cheap i mean it's almost like a 

208.47 219.95 A: it's almost like a priority if you don't spend the three hundred dollars and buy a cheap computer then you're just setting up a priority way in a way that you don't really want it 'cause they're pretty cheap now i think it's like three hundred bucks you can get one that actually you 

214.72 216.10 B: yeah that's true [laughter] 

220.18 221.76 A: know cruises the internet 

222.12 225.37 A: you can't play unreal on it but you can cruise the internet on 

225.62 227.22 B: yeah 

225.75 227.52 A: it yeah 

228.93 234.75 A: mm let's see what else [laughter] well let's see what else um 

229.25 231.74 B: [laughter] all right [laughter] 

235.39 241.84 A: [cough] i guess one of the dangers too would be kids screwing around on the computers too instead of ah doing what they're supposed to do 

240.19 246.90 B: yeah yeah i remember growing up we'd always play ah computer games during classes and [laughter] 

246.36 249.57 A: yeah i heard about some pretty good l._a._n. games there at school 

249.31 256.65 B: [laughter] you know we played oregon trail have you ever heard of that oh yeah it's wonderful [laughter] 

252.88 254.60 A: [laughter] yeah i heard of that 

255.53 258.09 A: i've never played it myself but i've heard it's pretty cool 

257.93 260.18 B: yeah yeah [laughter] 

258.85 261.61 A: can you play it on a l._a._n. with a bunch of people 

261.35 262.42 B: um 

262.85 267.51 B: no i think it wa- that was like an old one back in the day when computers were just coming out 

266.55 267.81 A: oh okay 

267.86 268.84 B: um 

268.90 272.60 B: now yeah now there's a ton of a ton of good games but 

271.86 280.10 A: yeah yeah i think that's a lot of the education now too when [cough] i i been taking computer classes ah like ah ah fiscal classes and stuff 

279.83 281.47 B: mhm 

280.21 284.65 A: and the guys that sit in the back they always seem to end up wanting to play video games back there in the back row 

284.46 286.12 B: [laughter] 

286.14 292.90 A: [laughter] i don't know if ah i don't know if it if any enhances their education or not back there 

286.35 287.85 B: yeah 

290.96 292.18 B: [laughter] 

292.58 295.31 B: it's tempting though they're there you know [laughter] 

294.33 300.87 A: [laughter] yeah i mean they're all yeah we all have one in front of us so yeah i can find myself cruising the web when we're in class sometimes 

300.93 303.38 A: and we're not doing much it's kinda slow 

303.26 305.61 B: yeah if you have a laptop too it's [sigh] 

305.77 308.32 A: yeah i go out cruising ebay or something like or 

307.75 308.91 B: [laughter] 

308.46 310.03 A: [laughter] 

309.55 311.45 B: yeah 

310.83 315.55 A: so i i can see where they do kinda hinder and and sometimes hinder education 

315.26 322.69 B: what i like is that you can be interactive like if you're sitting in a class and you know you wanna look the teacher wants to look up something they can do it right there 

321.28 322.37 A: (( but )) 

322.74 323.67 A: yes 

323.42 333.58 B: that's almost be- been pretty good especially like i do a lot of like sitting around in finance classes and that type of thing and you can look at the stock market live right there while you're talking about [noise] it 

332.91 334.14 A: that's pretty cool 

333.87 335.66 B: yeah 

335.25 338.72 A: yeah i i do the same we looked at like drivers and stuff like that when we were 

338.74 352.50 A: trying to make our computers work and in my computer classes it's kinda handy being able to just pull them up real quick and get everything working so yeah i like them i'm i'm trying to teach my kids to use them at an early age so they're really comfortable with them 

344.27 346.16 B: yeah 

352.39 358.99 B: yeah i was i was always scared of them when they were first coming out i don't know it's just like you're [laughter] afraid of messing something up 

357.63 368.26 A: yes yeah that's the way i was when i first started i don't wanna screw it up neither you know when you screw it up you just redo it again so i can't tell you how many i how many times i've screwed mine up 

360.26 362.19 B: yeah 

364.04 365.59 B: [laughter] 

367.71 368.80 B: [laughter] 

368.38 369.76 A: redid it and so on 

369.90 372.58 A: but i'm pretty good now so i just have to 

372.71 378.62 A: [cough] i need to dedicate a machine now to my kids that they can just totally screw up and then teach them how to fix it how 

378.75 380.03 A: to reinstall 

378.96 379.62 B: [laughter] 

380.03 387.04 B: yeah i've never i mean i don't know how to screw anything up except for maybe deleting something that you wanna save that's the only thing i could think of [mn] 

388.50 391.02 B: or downloading a virus i guess [laughter] 

389.40 394.67 A: it yeah that's too mhm i've done that one before that was like my first introduction really 

392.58 393.42 B: huh 

394.92 407.32 A: i downloaded a a virus downloaded a a trojan horse that gave away my password to a._o._l. so everybody was dialing in on my a._o._l. account it was like introduction to the internet 

403.73 405.09 B: ah 

407.16 408.38 B: [laughter] 

407.62 411.54 A: it's like within one week my account was turned off what happened 

410.13 411.11 B: (( bad )) 

411.75 412.84 A: it was bad 

413.41 419.70 A: so like i guess that would have been tough if i had to do an education at home with my computer and my account got turned off 

413.79 415.44 B: (( yeah )) 

420.48 422.84 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

420.89 427.66 A: [laughter] i don't have it now whereas i i guess you can get like um a degree at home on your computer 

427.33 432.21 B: yeah i've always wondered about that those always seem a little bit ah sketchy to me 

431.91 441.03 A: yeah it would be kinda borderline on your resume i think it'd look good having a a masters degree [laughter] in the location you had to put down you know 

436.30 437.32 B: [laughter] 

440.97 441.91 B: [laughter] 

441.30 447.59 A: my living room couch or something i don't know [laughter] 

442.95 447.00 B: take a few multiple choice ah [laughter] quizzes online [laughter] 

448.57 450.04 A: (( [sigh] yeah i don't know )) 

449.94 451.67 B: so it does actually exist 

451.74 453.61 A: those degrees online 

453.52 457.04 B: yeah yeah that's amazing 

453.67 455.93 A: yeah they do matter of fact 

456.29 457.58 A: isn't that something else 

458.17 463.12 A: yeah almost worth the money i had just to be able to say yeah i got a a masters degree 

461.41 462.46 B: [laughter] 

463.31 465.21 B: [laughter] from wherever 

464.51 474.06 A: [laughter] from swahili or something i don't know where they do it out of it must be some other foreign country or something i know they have like those cari- caribbean 

471.54 472.60 B: [laughter] 

474.22 477.93 A: schools you go to that they're cheap and you just get a degree there real quick 

477.90 478.83 B: yeah 

478.37 480.91 A: i don't think they have very much of a prestige though 

480.75 483.55 B: yeah that's where you go to med school [laughter] if you can 

482.43 485.46 A: yeah that's right that's what it is med school down there huh huh 

485.20 487.06 B: yeah 

486.67 488.18 A: med school on the web 

490.16 491.70 A: (( what if they do )) 

491.13 494.67 B: i don't know they don't they don't have it on the web but that's where 

492.74 496.89 A: (( that next no they don't have it on the web i'm just being facetious )) 

494.71 495.95 B: no [laughter] 

497.51 501.99 A: [laughter] send you a cadaver in the mail and then just practice away i don't know 

501.41 502.13 B: (( yeah all )) 

502.52 504.54 A: [laughter] 

504.07 506.44 B: right how long have we spoken for so far 

506.03 507.92 A: oh got about another minute here john 

507.75 511.45 B: oh okay well how does that work does it beep or something 

510.82 518.00 A: ah they'll come on and say that you're the time's up and then they'll give you like ten seconds to say goodbye or something like that this is only the second time i've ever done this 

517.63 521.12 B: okay yeah i just saw like ten bucks for [laughter] ten minutes 

521.09 522.46 A: ah sounds like fat walling 

522.91 524.70 B: what's that 

523.59 525.82 A: sounds like i've i found it on the internet 

525.83 527.72 B: yeah 

525.98 527.96 A: yeah i found this on the internet 

528.00 529.63 B: yeah me as well [laughter] 

529.05 530.35 A: it's pretty cool though 

530.88 535.84 A: so i i guess it's serving it's purpose for them yeah we've got about one more minute 

534.47 536.21 B: yeah 

535.91 544.13 A: so let's see what else about education can we think about here computers and education computers and education kind of a dry subject in a way 

544.16 555.26 B: yeah well it's kinda nice 'cause like you use computers everywhere in your life so it's you know it's prepar- i guess it's preparing you for that so if you don't use it you go out into the real world and then what happens 

544.94 545.99 A: um 

555.01 556.02 A: that's true 

555.85 557.92 B: yeah you're way behind 

557.21 560.34 A: yeah 'cause that is they're gonna be like everywhere you'll really 

560.42 565.69 A: i mean they're already pretty much are but in the near future they're gonna be really everywhere 

560.74 562.56 B: yeah 

565.84 568.75 A: you really won't be able to function without being able to use one 

568.82 570.69 B: yeah 

569.52 574.33 A: that's coming up pretty fast right in the next five ten fifteen years they'll be everywhere 

574.07 580.72 B: and just like even working as a cashier i mean they use you know it's kind of like a computer on the screen i used to work at a 

581.01 585.91 B: place called myer where you know the the cashier was basically like a computer 

581.66 582.93 A: (( mhm )) 

586.00 591.75 B: and you know that's you know not one of not one of the best jobs in- you know if those are using computers then 

592.43 594.32 B: (( so you know it's amazing )) 

594.45 599.89 A: yeah a lot of places are using computers now for their for work so i guess it would get you kinda worked into it to use them in sc- 

597.57 598.53 B: yeah
