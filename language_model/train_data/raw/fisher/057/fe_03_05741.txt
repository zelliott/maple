6.53 8.31 A: (( [laughter] )) 

8.08 10.02 B: where where are you located 

9.65 14.19 A: (( new york city )) 

10.93 16.84 B: i'm on long island i have an unusual name which i'm not going to even bother mentioning 

17.06 18.54 A: okay [laughter] 

17.38 19.42 B: you won't even understand it 

18.88 20.95 A: go ahead what is it 

20.40 22.39 B: oh uh kenyan 

22.34 27.32 A: kenyan all right that's not too bad go ahead 

23.01 23.82 B: (( yes )) 

24.63 30.92 B: all right let's let's get down to business 'cause i i'm so ready to talk about education and uh computers in classrooms 

30.31 32.65 A: right go ahead 

30.93 34.55 B: now you're phoning i'm going to like go crazy 

34.22 35.88 A: sure go ahead 

34.98 36.88 B: now um [lipsmack] 

37.08 38.57 B: oh you want me to go first 

37.99 38.78 A: yeah go 

39.02 41.86 B: 'cause you know uh okay 

39.07 40.96 A: (( ahead )) 

42.25 44.33 B: i'm wasting time okay 

44.77 50.08 B: [sigh] computers in education um i'm going to have to say i mean obviously 

50.53 57.84 B: obviously they woul- they would be helpful but uh if they're introduced too early 

58.86 64.80 B: i- you know uh with kids then i think it can cause some damage 

64.93 66.79 B: uh in particular 

66.26 68.23 A: what would too early be 

68.19 70.60 B: uh let me see good question um 

69.70 73.04 A: grammar school grammar school 

70.61 71.54 B: what 

72.24 79.23 B: no i would say like i would say a good good time to introduce computers would be 

79.67 81.78 B: like uh 

81.80 85.16 B: fourth grade i don't know fifth gr- fifth grade 

82.77 86.89 A: fourth or fifth grade yeah sounds all right 

85.50 87.10 B: only because uh 

87.45 92.55 B: [mn] well the main thing i have the main issue i have with computers as far as 'specially like 

92.48 103.41 B: bringing them in too soon is because of uh repetitive stress injury which can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome that i've gotten like pain in my arms that's why if you start 

97.79 99.94 A: (( right )) 

99.97 101.44 A: i had that 

103.35 113.52 B: th- the sooner you start that like the worse it's going to be and like it's if if you have like kids depending too much on computers which kids are already doing they're like playing games and shit then like 

113.92 115.66 B: [mn] that could be harmful 

115.88 118.52 B: um as far as like other things 

117.07 119.78 A: did you have it in school 

120.00 124.15 B: oh yeah but i mean when i was i mean i'm like in my late twenties so 

123.02 125.04 A: [noise] [noise] 

124.38 125.74 B: when i was 

126.55 127.97 A: (( all )) 

126.57 131.75 B: in grammar school grade school it was like computers were kind of just like starting like to be 

130.72 143.76 A: right i was in high school so i'm thirty five we had a bullshit computer class when i was in high school but it was like really super super basic i guess like 

133.86 134.95 B: yeah 

141.55 144.75 B: mhm but it wasn't there wasn't much you could do then 

144.14 152.88 A: first second generation dos based stuff just for you know if then statements if you probably don't even know what those are 

145.14 145.96 B: (( you know )) 

147.60 149.30 B: right 

152.94 155.28 A: but that's what we used to do they used to teach us to write 

155.49 163.41 B: well what do you think how about today though 'cause like now we have such uh highly developed things you can do like what do you think about right now 

157.63 159.74 A: (( these )) 

160.82 163.53 A: now it's like uh i don't know i 

163.46 175.46 A: my uh my brother's got a kid who is just uh graduating high school he's going to go to college and he's a super computer kid see that uh you can't get him away from the thing and all he does is play games 

165.28 166.59 B: mhm 

171.02 171.77 B: (( mm )) 

175.23 188.75 A: and go on the internet i guess s- so i don't know how good it was for him my brother is one of those guys who's been in computers since computers came around so he he's like a big computer tech type of guy so o- 

176.72 178.01 B: right 

187.67 189.73 B: do you think uh 

188.73 197.17 A: he's obviously his kid got into it too but his kid didn't get into it like did like my bro- my brother knows everything his kid only knows how to play games 

196.46 198.61 B: [mn] but i think um 

198.79 208.68 B: aside from like you know people kids will get computers on their own and use it at home and i think like i guess this the t- this topic is specifically aimed more aimed 

208.13 213.61 A: towards the uh in the classroom in education so uh well he uses it in school too i'm sure 

208.91 210.28 B: in the classroom 

210.92 214.20 B: yeah that's what we're supposed to be talking about more yeah mm 

213.60 225.56 A: but you never hear him talk anything about it what they do in school if they're learning programming or anything like that so uh i don't know what i didn't have them in school to to use as a learning aid so i don't know what they're doing with them now 

225.66 237.15 A: but basically alls i hear is kids playing games and s- getting in trouble [laughter] that's all um if they're not teaching them like specific computer science type stuff like programming or hardware development or anything like that i 

229.55 230.82 B: yeah 

234.61 235.30 B: (( mm )) 

237.29 239.98 A: have no idea what they're using it for 

237.35 237.97 B: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

238.36 250.33 B: d- do do you think that s- uh students should definitely be using computers more in like as a complement to their studies as opposed to like depending too much on the computer to do everything right 

248.78 252.24 A: yeah i like your idea about not getting it too early 

252.34 255.59 A: 'cause i could imagine if w- w- i had them when i was 

255.48 268.57 A: very young i wouldn't have learned the a._b._c.s and the one two threes i would have been screwing round with that thing uh left and right so i don't know if they're learning or not i think it's horrible that they're constantly in front of the computer but that's not really an education issue so 

260.20 262.26 B: mm yeah exactly 

268.60 270.37 B: yeah 

269.39 271.06 A: they're all like fat kids now 

271.42 275.89 B: yeah and also the other thing i was going to say was 

276.30 283.65 B: like computers are like are expensive so it's probably instead of uh 

284.16 290.00 B: constantly i don't intend spending a lot of money on computers they could prob- maybe use money for like other things [mn] 

289.29 290.32 A: (( [laughter] )) 

290.33 299.59 A: [noise] yeah well i know when i went back to my high school to see what was going on years later they had a whole big computer department classroom and all that and they spent 

293.84 294.68 B: mhm 

299.59 309.95 A: ridiculous amounts of money o- setting up the whole thing and there was the same guy teaching the class who taught me typing when that classroom used to be full of typewriters and uh 

308.22 309.32 B: right 

309.73 319.63 A: i think i the typing was worth it you learned how to type at least but these kids h- sit in front of a keyboard all day and they can't type 

315.21 316.21 B: yeah 

319.69 320.72 B: yeah 

319.71 333.88 A: so at least i learned some i don't know what they're learning in that class i mean he walked around with the guy and he showed me some stuff and i was like i wasn't impressed for the uh massive amount of money they spent on uh doing that which is probably all donations and shit since it was a catholic school 

333.49 335.11 B: (( right [mn] is )) 

333.84 335.53 A: but uh 

335.82 340.02 B: this is this uh have you done other phone calls 

336.31 337.78 A: (( this )) 

339.71 341.06 A: is my second one 

341.17 343.51 B: yeah how did you find out about 

343.15 351.15 A: i saw it on a listing on the internet in the craig list that's where you saw it [laughter] somebody's getting a lot of 

346.46 348.67 B: it yeah yeah that's where i found it [laughter] 

349.28 350.37 B: yeah 

351.77 354.97 A: (( referrals )) 

353.09 354.12 B: uh 

354.24 358.71 B: well like the uh the research the people doing it's probably set up there now 

359.18 366.23 A: i don't know it was a guy who had a referral code i. b. a pin number just like and me got i don't know did you sign up on the internet 

364.28 365.83 B: (( oh you think so )) 

366.56 367.39 B: huh 

367.01 370.06 A: did you sign up on their web page 

369.57 371.86 B: um i i guess so 

371.58 373.81 A: or did you call the phone number 

373.40 376.23 B: well right now well no i signed up 

375.74 379.92 A: oh yes so then you had you were they were asked for a pin number i don't know unless you 

379.15 381.18 B: right right yeah i got a pin 

380.06 382.72 A: i put a pin number in so some guy got a referral 

382.89 389.90 A: so if anybody uses my pin number i think if enough of people do it you get like a dollar per person or something like that 

384.69 385.41 B: (( mm )) 

389.12 394.02 B: you got you got anything else to say about computers and education is it is it helpful you 

394.06 399.50 A: uh yeah in some ways and some ways it's probably not 

394.83 395.57 B: think 

395.99 397.30 B: well what's helpful 

399.27 411.72 A: so i mean i don't know i- it'd be a good question to ask a younger kid if they had an opinion at all because i didn't have it in school i mean i didn't have stuff like that in school but and we did our fair share of screwing around 

410.78 416.01 B: mm [mn] right i mean well obviously there were it would be helpful because i mean mm 

414.21 417.92 A: you said you're in your twenties so you had it in high school 

417.50 419.98 B: um lemme think 

420.14 426.15 B: yeah but i just did uh like we didn't even have uh i mean there was no internet then 

426.17 431.77 B: you know but uh yeah i mean i just learned uh word processing and learned how to type and like 

426.24 429.94 A: (( right )) 

430.82 443.48 A: uh so you you were like one [noise] one level ahead of me i've had regular typing on just the regular electric typewriter and you had like a word processing type of thing so i guess it would be ha- half the kids in their 

431.89 433.82 B: other things things like that 

437.56 438.39 B: (( yeah mm )) 

443.95 445.62 A: late teens or 

445.60 450.84 A: very early twenties maybe had computers in school so i don't know i mean uh 

450.82 462.45 A: i haven't really talked to enough people to know if it's helping them or not i mean yeah it's nice to write papers and all that actually i talked to one girl who told me she used to buy term papers off the [mn] internet so i don't know how [laughter] 

462.44 465.93 A: how useful the computer was for her she didn't write the damn paper itself 

462.79 463.93 B: (( mm yeah )) 

464.83 465.82 B: but in 

465.97 468.50 B: but in yeah but in the classroom 

468.79 473.30 B: it can only like if if you're in a classroom you'd probably be uh i 

471.72 475.17 A: (( so )) 

474.13 480.11 B: mean not not everyone has a computer at home but if you're in a classroom using it then you go home and use it you know like 

478.38 490.27 A: yeah i don't know how it works in in in the classroom [laughter] does everybody have their own computer that they sit at and work on something or uh er is there only a few of them and they're using them to teach i don't 

480.69 481.72 B: can be a lot 

489.31 491.81 B: well probably depends on the school you know 

490.83 494.42 A: yeah i don't know i mean we all sat at our own computer 

493.94 494.81 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

494.24 507.49 A: when we did it in high school and we did stupid crap tried to follow along with the teacher and there was a game called uh wargames it's just like that wargames movie that was out when i was younger and that's what we did is 

504.01 504.82 B: uh-huh 

505.72 506.60 B: right 

507.38 510.03 A: the global thermonuclear war game 

510.17 511.60 B: fun stuff 

510.95 517.58 A: [laughter] not that it was like a little game where you actually typed typed words [mn] there was no mouse and all of that we didn't have a mouse 

517.53 526.78 A: just had the keyboard so i i i didn't get anything out of the whole computer thing in in school but i'm sure it has advanced tremendously now there was no windows 

517.76 518.63 B: yeah 

525.02 526.54 B: [noise] i think that 

526.94 528.67 B: (( [mn] promise you'll listen to this )) 

528.35 529.67 A: go ahead 

529.03 533.59 B: well we're going to [laughter] listen to this like i don't stress enough the repetitive stress 

530.26 533.76 A: (( did )) 

533.80 535.80 B: injury on the f- on the hand 

535.28 538.61 A: you get carpal tunnel 

536.78 544.54 B: no but i g- i get like um i started getting pain so i had to like [mn] be more careful about how much i type 

543.96 554.52 A: right i realized i was getting it and i i actually went to a doctor because carpal tunnel wasn't that big yet so when i first got a computer it was like nineteen ninety or something 

547.02 548.00 B: mhm 

550.75 551.72 B: right 

554.08 554.87 B: (( [mn] mm )) 

554.34 568.09 A: and i s- really started to learn a lot about it i'm a mechanical person so i wanted to know how it worked and uh i was spending a lot of time on it and i started to get the carpal tunnel so i don't know if the schools address that type of thing or not 

558.11 558.81 B: (( mm )) 

559.14 560.11 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

564.42 565.41 B: (( yeah )) 

566.84 574.56 B: yeah i think that's something that i mean that kind of thing is like something that's i think only getting starting to get more attention now because 

574.60 577.73 B: computers are fairly a fairly recent invention so 

578.40 581.24 B: it's only like the number 

579.90 581.99 A: you're really talking maybe ten years 

582.06 586.29 B: the number people that are experiencing that uh is starting to increase 

586.37 587.46 A: for sure 

586.87 587.68 B: (( so )) 

587.62 591.50 A: i wonder if they use them in the classroom in other countries 

593.19 594.85 B: [mn] ten minutes isn't up yet what's 

594.53 597.63 A: [laughter] i know i'm waiting for that too 

595.25 596.26 B: going on here 

597.17 598.39 B: [laughter] 

597.76 599.89 A: uh i don't know 

599.52 599.89 B: (( [mn] ))
