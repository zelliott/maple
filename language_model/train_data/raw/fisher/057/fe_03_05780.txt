15.36 24.98 A: well it said what does the word family mean to you when i hear the word family i just think of people who are biologically related you know the immediate family the mother the father and the children 

22.66 23.78 B: right 

24.62 31.39 B: right i think yeah family is you know it could be two senses i guess you know biologically related and you know those who 

31.42 38.12 B: become known as you know you feel family towards them you know close friends or whatever could be family as well 

37.58 39.65 A: yes it comes from the word familiar 

39.30 40.64 B: right exactly 

41.82 42.91 B: um 

43.68 47.47 A: but ah topic is this the first your first ah call 

43.79 45.15 B: family are people you 

46.85 48.40 B: yeah 

47.83 55.20 A: now is my third so i think this is my last one ever 'cause you you're only allowed three the first two are easier than this one

54.96 55.94 B: right 

55.25 56.33 A: um 

56.16 64.63 B: ah just anyone that you get family also you you know people you tend to count on for you know to for things that you need people that are close to 

64.92 65.60 B: (( you )) 

64.98 70.65 A: right or it has to do with people but of course they're just people that think the same way you do even if you don't meet them 

70.45 71.58 B: (( mm right )) 

70.77 79.68 A: even if you don't actually know them and it's also like a a family of um [mn] you know like i mean like a species of plants or animals or whatever 

79.07 80.41 B: exactly 

80.64 84.65 B: but you know i guess you know you said people that that think the same way you do is that what you said 

84.69 87.73 A: yeah well sometimes you feel a kinship with them 

87.19 89.38 B: right right 

88.91 92.99 A: i don't know if it's as strong as a well kinship is related to family also 

94.97 96.45 B: yeah i don't know 

95.85 98.35 A: you know the word kin means relatives 

97.77 102.81 B: (( right exactly hm it's going to be hard to fill ten minutes though with ah )) 

102.55 109.51 A: yeah but i don't think they're interested so much in ah idioms as the way we use language i think that's the nature of this study 

109.02 110.85 B: right 

110.31 114.68 A: i saw something where'd you get this off a how'd you find out about this thing 

113.64 116.15 B: actually my aunt referred me for this 

115.36 129.62 A: oh i was looking i saw something else i got to get back to them i um 'cause i don't have a computer so i've got to go use somebody elses it says thirty dollars for a a a one hour linguistics study on the telephone not this it was something else 

119.21 120.07 B: uh-huh 

126.18 127.20 B: right 

128.89 129.81 B: okay 

129.93 137.64 A: so ah [laughter] maybe there's ah like a whole bunch of things like this i don't know the only prob- 

131.23 132.09 B: [laughter] 

134.68 135.97 B: yeah maybe 

136.01 139.61 B: well she described i thought that um that the when the the conversation 

138.39 141.82 A: [mn] yeah a- actually it's a it's a family of linguistic studies 

141.81 146.08 B: (( there there you go well there's there's connection [laughter] family connection )) 

145.95 152.56 A: yeah i just wish it wasn't so long 'til you got paid it'd be great if the minute you hung up there's ten dollars and that arrived magically 

148.08 149.15 B: yeah 

151.91 166.03 B: right right but ah she when my aunt described it to me i thought that i was going to be talking to a like you know someone from the study talking to you about you know different topics i didn't realise that you were talking to other participants but but that's interesting 

164.54 172.48 A: no i i read ah i read something about this before for participants ah by the way the ad i saw they asked for all all men 

172.52 176.05 A: so i thought it was just men but last night they had me smoked speaking to a woman 

175.68 183.47 B: yeah well they said they're looking for men 'cause it's harder to it's harder for them to get men and if you can refer men you get a dollar i guess for every any every referral 

178.73 179.92 A: yeah 

182.58 185.57 A: oh is that what it is i think it's probably referring people 

184.57 190.56 B: and then if you get up to ten if you get ten ah males referred then you get fifteen dollars that's an extra five if you get a 

189.78 195.76 A: oh so it'll be an extra twenty five oh 'cause i could um i'm almost every i know lots of people who would be willing to do this 

194.89 200.21 B: no not twenty five it's it'll be just an extra five like it'll be fifteen all together yeah yeah 

197.58 203.94 A: oh so a total of fifteen i could probably get about thirty dollars i could probably recommend about twenty people well [mn] 

202.82 207.29 B: yeah i i i mean yeah between my wife and i i mean we have a quite a few people to refer 

207.38 214.62 A: yeah it's better if you don't it's better if you don't know people who are interested in picking up ten dollars this way [laughter] top dollar unfortunately i do 

207.38 208.68 B: (( so i mean )) 

211.94 213.89 B: right what were the other two topics 

214.26 216.99 B: right what were the the other two topics do you remember 

216.56 224.36 A: ah yeah last night it was about whether or not to actually use computers ah computers is it good or bad to teach kids computers in school 

223.76 224.96 B: right 

224.37 234.44 A: that was pretty open ended and the other one was do do um [mn] we think ah a- any other na- nation poses a threat to the united states 

234.68 235.97 B: (( oh okay )) 

236.32 237.30 B: [laughter] 

236.40 239.65 A: those were easy [mn] those were a lot easier to talk about 

238.22 239.32 B: right 

239.58 245.14 B: well i'm trying to think of what else we could what else ah what are my other thoughts on family i can't really think of a whole lot 

245.34 247.06 B: like i thought it'd be yeah 

246.08 252.06 A: well the well what the word family means to you i was once involved in something i i can't um 

252.56 258.36 A: [mn] i can't tell you what it was but it was a way to make money and it was legal and um [mn] 

256.13 257.00 B: uh-huh 

258.26 272.52 A: if you had i i was able to tell there were other people doing it there was a way i could tell and i felt ah it it's kind of like you look up in the sky and you figure there's life on other planets although you never get and you've got a feeling they're thinking about you also 

268.58 269.43 B: right 

272.46 273.45 B: right 

272.70 281.61 A: i i knew that i knew that these other people were out there doing this this was something which turned my life around for about a year i made a lot for a very short while i made a lot of money doing this 

278.36 279.21 B: huh 

281.17 282.17 B: yeah 

281.45 285.54 A: i knew there were other people doing it although i didn't know who they were 

285.34 296.53 A: and i was thinking about who they were and things like that and i knew they were thinking about me and one jerk pretty i mean it was kind of it was the kind of thing that was too good to last one jerk pretty much ruined it by trying he got very greedy 

296.45 297.44 B: (( really )) 

297.25 305.06 A: he he was trying he he was trying to make ah like ah a- i was making a lot of money and this guy wanted to make as much in a day as i was making in maybe a month 

304.51 306.28 B: (( oh right )) 

305.22 312.74 A: and ah it it got to the point where it got too big ah you know something had to happen and it got too big and something happened hm 

308.95 310.90 B: what was it involving and what 

311.06 312.04 B: right 

312.21 315.30 B: so what was it like and what what w- w- was the kind of thing were you doing 

315.44 322.48 A: um somebody ah i wasn't doing anything illegal but somebody else was and i found there was a way i was able to piggyback on it 

321.88 323.51 B: right right 

322.88 329.39 A: i i was able to ah stay on the sidelines ah it wasn't a guaranteed thing because one day i lost three thousand dollars doing it 

329.13 330.06 B: right 

329.46 338.87 A: but um but i can't you know the the bottom line over the long run i turned out way ahead i was actually for a while i was getting fantasies about ah 

334.50 335.49 B: uh-huh 

339.46 350.84 A: this isn't going to last a year it it didn't it only lasted maybe ah two months but i was expecting if this thing lasts a year by the time it's over maybe just maybe i'll have a quarter million dollars put away 

344.02 345.16 B: (( right )) 

350.42 352.07 B: (( right uh-huh right [laughter] )) 

351.30 356.77 A: of course it never happened [laughter] you know it just couldn't last that long one jerk i don't know who he was 

352.46 353.88 B: (( right [laughter] right )) 

356.21 357.21 B: right 

357.08 358.34 A: but um 

358.35 366.94 A: i know he was operating out of ah the boston area that's all i know about him ah i assume it was a him it was mostly men ah he ah 

360.78 361.64 B: uh-huh 

361.80 362.95 B: right 

364.08 365.08 B: (( [laughter] )) 

367.08 379.94 A: he ruined it for everybody there's a lot of things ah they there's things s- somewhat similar to that in nature has come along but they're never going to ah they're never going there's always going to be people who get greedy or get stupid or get lazy 

368.36 369.30 B: mhm 

379.31 381.39 B: right right 

380.80 393.37 A: one thing which sc- this wasn't criminal but it had something in common with criminal enterprise it required secrecy and all that one thing which screws up criminal enterprise is the people get lazy they get greedy and they start fighting with their partners 

387.40 388.30 B: uh-huh 

392.75 394.02 B: right 

393.48 403.17 A: and this is the kind of thing where people and they get lazy and they they get greedy they're going to start with other people who do it and that's going well but you see that's maybe where families are different 

398.42 399.32 B: uh-huh 

402.65 416.57 B: yeah well i was thinking about families too i guess families are constantly evolving too it's not a s- it's not a a one thing i mean yeah you're born with you have your mother and father and and brothers and sisters and then if you get married then your family your family extends and 

403.45 404.34 A: they come 

415.89 419.87 A: yeah it's the same kind of family just different people playing the rules 

416.57 417.78 B: you constantly 

419.33 420.35 B: right 

420.77 424.11 A: these mafia families are falling apart because ah 

424.42 429.00 A: you got guys like john gotti who like getting ah h- you know they like getting in the newspaper 

428.84 430.25 B: (( yeah [laughter] really that's )) 

429.63 433.14 A: it's not like the old d- the old wise guys who shunned publicity 

433.10 434.21 B: right 

433.82 436.84 A: you know they ran some cameras they didn't pose for them 

436.44 443.22 B: [laughter] yeah well that's put a different light on family too that's a whole different way of thinking about it that's a you know 

441.48 442.37 A: yeah 

442.62 445.79 A: it was a more liberal family they didn't ah 

446.25 450.07 A: for some kind of crime family to go anywhere the um 

448.91 449.73 B: (( mhm )) 

450.29 455.21 A: there has to be this one guy on top who has absol- you know it it can't be a democracy 

454.59 455.68 B: right 

455.46 460.70 A: there's got to be a guy who gives orders and he has to be feared and respected and it has to be a guy with good judgement 

460.12 461.38 B: right 

461.45 472.94 B: now also my brother um i just just thought of this has um actually just left a couple of days ago for china 'cause he and his wife are have they've they've already adopted one child from china and they're on their way to get to getting a second one 

467.99 468.98 A: china 

472.96 474.71 B: now so that's a 

474.94 478.81 B: yeah now their family's going to expand over over two different continents now 

478.96 484.57 B: so that's um you know they they've um have one i guess she's three year's old now 

484.62 491.36 B: and then um they're just on their way to getting a second one so that's how they're getting their family yeah it's really interesting 

488.38 489.30 A: i saw 

490.10 495.22 A: i saw something in a newspaper i actually found the newspaper in the computer where i was looking for a job 

495.25 496.05 B: uh-huh 

495.41 501.46 A: they um they want people native speakers in english to go to china to teach people english 

501.35 502.31 B: (( really )) 

501.91 507.22 A: which i don't know how you could do it if you can't speak chinese yourself i never understood that but 

505.95 510.38 B: yeah yeah you've got to know at least a working knowledge of china or else how could you ah 

510.30 519.51 A: well they said it's not necessary so once i get a hold of the computer i'm going to it shows how great i'm doing here that i'm looking for the [mn] yeah but i'll be eventually going to china 

512.49 513.17 B: (( oh )) 

518.71 519.97 B: (( right just )) 

519.74 526.38 A: and um i'll contact them actually i really doubt they'd ah would want want somebody like me and there's something wrong with them if they do 

526.10 530.12 B: just make sure the sars ah thing has cleared up before you go [laughter] 

526.47 527.75 A: but 

529.60 532.26 A: (( ah oh no they're saying they have that under control )) 

531.65 532.88 B: yeah 

532.28 535.10 A: but they also say you can't believe anything that comes out of there 

534.66 541.56 B: exactly well they also ah denied that it was even a problem when it was a problem so i don't really believe you know how do you know what to believe so 

535.33 536.48 A: (( you know you can't )) 

540.17 542.45 A: yes some good points good points 

542.36 543.20 B: (( so )) 

542.58 546.37 A: yeah that's the bad thing about lying though people don't believe you even when you tell the truth 

545.65 547.26 B: [laughter] yeah exactly 

546.44 551.64 A: oh by the way the thing i was telling you about ah the statute of limitations has passed on that anyway 

548.44 549.27 B: uh-huh 

551.28 553.16 B: right [laughter] 

552.16 556.45 A: [laughter] although i doubt anyone's listening for anything other than how we use language 

555.72 557.35 B: exactly yeah 

556.46 559.79 A: that whole thing was over more it ended more than six years' ago 

559.24 560.81 B: right right 

560.00 564.04 A: but it's you know once you do that it's it's hard to adjust to regular life again 

563.65 566.50 B: yeah i would imagine yeah 

564.62 567.88 A: once yeah every day is a thrill 

567.24 572.06 B: yeah [laughter] so ah what else has to do with family what else 

571.43 576.92 A: see back then i wouldn't have done this [laughter] it's just you know it's not worth picking up a phone for ten dollars 

575.70 578.05 B: [laughter] no no i don't blame you 

578.66 581.64 B: (( so can you hang on one second okay ))
