230.06 231.17 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

231.51 232.14 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

237.00 248.22 A: how i don't see anybody as a threat but ah i i guess um if anyone i have to say north korea if anybody [sigh] but on- only because they're i think they're ah their leader's a bit crazy but [sigh] you know that's just you know 

247.69 260.42 B: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah they might but i i don't think s- so [noise] because they know their whole country would be totally d- destroyed [noise] [noise] so i don't think they're that crazy

283.64 293.56 A: [sigh] well i think ah i'm sorry i i as i say i think a lot of americans think that everybody's a threat and they're afraid of everybody so they probably [sigh] when they set up this question they were probably expecting ah [sigh] 

293.71 298.69 A: you know what i mean a couple of people who are just afraid of everybody you know [sigh] talking about how canada's not ten days [noise]
