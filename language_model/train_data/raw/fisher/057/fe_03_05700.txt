198.91 203.56 A: yeah so ah wh- what else about ah threat to peace 

204.80 206.92 B: yeah maybe like 

207.02 209.80 B: if like somehow like 

209.94 213.06 B: people were to [noise] like 

214.03 217.91 B: like band against us because we were like so powerful 

217.59 219.36 A: yeah 

219.55 228.54 A: yeah like ah [noise] some other alliances going on i could see that who do you think would ah who do you think would team up against us [noise] [noise] 

223.06 224.32 B: (( yeah )) 

228.05 230.31 B: (( well it would have [noise] to be somebody big )) 

230.55 231.72 A: yeah 

232.13 233.62 A: like russia 

232.96 236.70 B: yeah 'cause we we're pretty strong 

236.11 238.26 A: yeah so's russia 

239.02 241.09 A: i don't know [noise] i think north korea's 

241.48 242.18 A: [noise] 

242.26 245.57 A: i think if they've got nuclear weapons man it'll be a threat 

244.58 247.13 B: i think everybody has nuclear weapons 

246.43 247.68 A: yeah 

248.93 250.00 B: (( you know )) 

249.28 256.77 A: [noise] i think yeah i know what you mean like everybody at war has the ability to harm someone else 

255.20 257.02 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

258.74 264.68 A: so it's tough to i guess it's tough to like pinpoint what direct threats are to us 

264.51 269.49 B: yeah i think it's stupid that you have to like kill somebody to solve a problem though 

268.84 271.77 A: oh yeah definitely 

271.82 273.78 A: i agree but 

273.86 275.95 A: i think the u._s. is kinda 

276.10 281.23 A: bringing it on ourselves like you know we go over there and kill a bunch of people 

281.46 282.42 A: and they ex- 

282.22 284.42 B: expect not to get shot 

283.36 284.99 A: (( yeah )) 

285.11 287.77 A: yeah makes people not like us in the end you know 

288.62 289.64 A: which ah 

289.87 296.05 A: shouldn't be really anything shocking but i feel like everyone's surprised that everybody hates us 

297.04 297.74 A: (( [mn] )) 

298.67 301.26 B: i'm not too much worried about north korea because they're 

301.27 305.36 B: they're fighting with south korea about r- rice or something about 

305.16 312.29 A: yeah yeah they do have other other conflicts and stuff and ah they're pretty weak economically 

307.99 313.39 B: (( that yeah )) 

312.80 314.24 A: (( ah but [mn] )) 

314.03 316.35 B: we can give them food and they'd leave us alone 

316.68 318.37 A: yeah 

318.59 320.27 A: yeah 

320.34 322.79 A: i think we should do that 

324.60 325.45 A: (( yeah )) 

325.63 326.98 A: (( [cough] um )) 

327.50 330.83 A: so you think iraq is going is going to continue to be a threat yeah 

330.46 332.93 B: yeah un- until 

334.02 338.88 B: until somebody does somebody like drastic like takes care of it 

338.58 341.34 A: yeah like what 

341.23 345.22 B: i don't know like me like i don't have any like 

345.41 347.70 B: because i stay neutral on things 

346.84 348.00 A: yeah 

347.78 352.99 B: like i don't give like like i think you should kill people or things like 

352.37 353.66 A: yeah 

354.51 358.02 B: like i just feel like if people were to like 

358.12 359.45 B: act like 

359.60 365.47 B: chris like christians like wha- what what's in the bible then we wouldn't have any of these problems 

361.41 362.43 A: mhm 

364.86 368.24 A: yeah that's that's a good point i 

368.40 370.82 A: know what you're saying i'm not really religious but ah 

371.08 374.12 B: i'm not that religious either but 

372.59 373.51 A: (( yeah um )) 

375.20 375.97 B: i 

375.99 385.37 B: i just i'm not a jehovah's witness i my parents are and i study with them and i'm just learning stuff and it's like it just makes sense 

379.72 380.58 A: yeah 

380.67 381.50 A: (( oh )) 

382.59 383.37 A: huh 

384.62 387.48 A: yeah that's cool 

388.11 389.41 A: so like 

390.10 394.39 A: how do witnesses deal with the problem like the iraq situation 

395.07 398.53 B: they they they wouldn't they would 

395.18 396.15 A: (( you know )) 

398.61 401.11 B: they would like go into hiding 

400.84 403.11 A: yeah just kinda keep to themselves 

402.49 403.22 B: yeah 

404.59 406.83 A: (( that's cool oh it )) 

406.93 409.70 A: seems that really would take care of the situation 

411.19 411.75 A: (( [cough] )) 

411.65 414.67 B: that's what he's doing he's hiding and he's waiting until 

414.68 417.95 B: the right moment he's going to get some people together to 

416.99 418.02 A: yeah 

418.15 421.69 B: i guess what happened is he took a whole bunch of money out of that bank 

421.92 423.18 A: yeah 

423.25 425.62 B: so he's got a lotta money 

424.58 427.49 A: yeah he's rich really rich 

428.15 428.90 A: (( [mn] mm )) 

429.10 432.08 B: and those people who'll do anything for money 

431.89 434.35 A: yeah definitely 

436.27 441.64 A: so what would you do if like there was a draft and you got drafted would you have to go or 

441.10 444.06 B: i'd i'd have to go but i wouldn't fight 

443.32 448.35 A: yeah hm yeah i thought about that too like what i would do 

448.62 450.80 B: (( but )) 

448.81 452.81 A: because i'm i'm anti war and like pretty much pacifist ah it 

453.39 455.30 A: (( would be weird [mn] [cough] )) 

458.02 459.01 A: er 

458.74 461.01 B: i don't like i i still have a year 

461.26 462.56 A: oh yeah 

461.81 463.53 B: yeah 

462.89 464.83 A: so you're you're only seventeen 

464.50 466.35 B: i'll be seventeen in august [mn] i 

465.72 466.93 A: (( oh ah )) 

467.09 468.62 A: that's cool 

469.26 473.62 A: yeah i don't think there'll be a draft it's just interesting to think about 

474.17 475.39 A: i think ah 

482.14 483.53 A: you know so what else [mn] man 

487.37 490.74 B: don't think cuba's that much of a threat threat any more 

489.93 494.77 A: yeah i don't think so either i think we were just kinda made them out to be a bigger threat than they were ah 

494.13 495.88 B: (( yeah )) 

496.33 499.51 B: i think we just don't like 'em because they make better stuff than we do 

499.18 503.07 A: yeah yeah i feel like um 

502.83 505.59 B: and their women are hotter 

504.18 506.51 A: [laughter] huh 

506.62 508.43 A: yeah 

508.98 512.75 A: the u._s. is about penis envy like that um 

514.37 517.47 A: yeah i think ah cuba is definitely not a threat 

518.43 519.86 A: (( i don't know i )) 

520.17 525.70 A: basically just think any threat is like a result of our our actions you know 

525.74 527.02 B: (( yeah )) 

525.75 528.86 A: it's cau- it's cause and effect inevitably 

528.47 533.50 B: yeah 'cause no one's just going to start with us 'cause we're not like someone to start with 

532.83 538.06 A: yeah i mean i don't really think there's any reason to start with anyone else in the first place but 

538.08 539.27 A: (( you know we ah )) 

540.64 542.65 A: we're going for it and 

542.46 547.43 B: another thing i think might cause us problems we keep on getting involved in like the israel 

547.82 549.12 B: (( and ah )) 

548.19 549.19 A: (( yes )) 

549.30 554.95 B: stuff and they're going to what they're going to do they're going to get pissed off at us and they're going to turn against us 

554.23 556.28 A: yeah i [mn] 

556.73 558.20 A: i think you're right that's 

558.87 561.18 A: that's a really sticky situation 

562.05 565.84 A: since we've been fighting with israel for so long it's like kinda turned 

566.30 569.00 A: the muslim world against us 

568.60 570.48 B: (( yes )) 

569.15 572.89 A: (( which is understandable i don't know they i )) 

573.11 574.18 A: think ah 

575.56 581.25 A: i think we've just been fighting with israel for so long because they're m- more like us and ah i 

582.07 582.82 B: (( yeah i )) 

582.66 584.94 A: don't necessarily think that's the right thing 

586.38 590.23 B: think we should just leave them alone and let them deal with their own problems 

589.94 591.65 A: yeah i mean 

591.46 595.26 B: just because we're big we don't have to settle our people's problems for them 

594.77 599.89 A: yeah yeah i agree especially in that situation like we've been
