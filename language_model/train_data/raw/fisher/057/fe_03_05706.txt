124.71 130.25 B: whatever type of reasons that they may have i 

130.78 136.11 B: don't think so i think this is more than a 

137.92 139.61 B: (( i don't know i think is )) 

139.79 146.31 B: i know i think it's a like more a- american paranoia type of thing 

146.35 148.14 B: that there are those 

148.25 151.94 B: (( countries over there that eh )) 

152.57 166.08 B: that they want to attack us and all all of that and ah and you know um by the way you know i i can't help but think about iraq you know 

165.99 167.41 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

166.72 167.62 B: (( i you )) 

167.65 168.77 B: know i 

169.18 171.26 B: i don't know i 

172.42 178.24 B: i i i i really think that iraq was wasn't never a real 

179.89 187.06 B: you know a real problem for united states i mean a threat for united states and ah 

187.53 197.56 B: just you know just to to to to say ah something about what what what do you think about this ir- iraq invasion and all this stuff 

198.47 199.55 A: um 

200.32 202.46 A: [mn] that the iraq invasion 

202.16 208.98 B: yeah that united states basically i can say excuse me the united states 

202.91 204.32 A: i 

209.00 211.78 B: (( occupation of )) 

211.89 213.14 B: (( iraq )) 

212.93 220.18 A: you you know when they used the term in in when they set us up that a threat to u._s. safety 

220.11 228.70 A: that made me think about the safety of americans in the u._s. um 

228.57 239.54 A: and and i mean the physical safety i- if if they talk if they if i was thinking of the safety of americans abroad um 

239.75 250.89 A: then i i would speak differently because i i think there are countries like iran and libya that have been involved in attacks on americans abroad um 

251.26 256.28 A: if it was about u._s. security um 

256.61 264.41 A: then i would say yes there are um countries that are a threat to u._s. security um because 

264.47 276.49 A: there's more to security than just physical safety like in in the first gulf war th- th- the idea that another country might choke off so much of the oil supply was a big 

276.54 285.50 A: threat to our security but i wou- didn't think of it as a threat to our safety and as far as this ir- iraq thing goes 

285.82 291.81 A: it it scared me more thinking of what saddam hussein might do in the region in the future 

291.88 293.98 A: with dangerous weapons 

294.16 297.75 A: than thinking about what might happen with him 

298.58 304.07 A: and america directly i mean the it didn't seem that they had 

304.18 315.57 A: strong evidence that he would be involved in attacks on americans in america but we've already seen what what he's done in the region he attacked two neighboring countries iran and then kuwait 

317.75 319.30 B: okay but 

318.57 324.57 A: so i so i mean i thought of thought of him as dangerous to our security but i wasn't so sure about our safety 

325.39 326.54 B: oh okay 

326.76 332.31 B: okay you thought iraq that saddam could be a danger for 

333.02 335.86 B: for our security here in america you say 

337.17 339.84 B: or for only for the region excuse me 

339.82 340.95 A: well the 

341.41 347.53 A: the rea- the reason it affects us i think i mean i think that's why we were there in the first gulf war 

347.71 349.28 B: yeah yeah 

348.11 351.38 A: because the region has a big effect on the rest of the world [sigh] 

352.37 357.08 B: well that's actually true that's actually true but ah 

358.33 362.12 B: how about all this issue of 

362.52 367.91 B: the weapons of mass destruction 

368.44 369.85 B: (( that )) 

372.10 375.43 B: that's one of the things that president bush says 

375.61 377.55 A: yeah 

376.37 379.42 B: and so far 

380.49 382.80 B: there aren't any 

383.34 387.52 B: findings about weapons of mass destruction 

387.43 389.54 A: yeah okay 

388.11 392.34 B: which is a real mess and it 

393.05 401.94 B: really becomes an issue against i can say or i may say against our government because 

402.26 407.98 B: so far they can't prove those weapons of mass destruction because 

408.27 412.75 B: they didn't find really anything about it 

413.76 415.73 B: and 

416.79 425.28 B: all all all the innocent people that is continued dying every day in iraq all our soldiers over there 

425.79 429.84 B: you know that they are dying every day 

430.27 441.79 B: that's going to take you know united states intervention's going to be for a long time in the region the same is not going the thing's not going to be finishing up tomorrow 

442.09 443.68 B: (( and ah )) 

442.75 444.54 A: yeah 

444.37 448.08 B: it may make me think if 

449.15 456.37 B: all of this was really necessary to be done you know it was necessary for united states to go there 

453.46 455.26 A: yeah 

457.14 458.57 B: ah i i 

459.05 461.81 B: yesterday i was passing by you know and ah 

462.44 464.38 B: (( i don't know how many )) 

464.79 467.50 B: (( millions a month )) 

467.71 469.29 B: united states 

470.45 473.02 B: is spending in the occupation 

473.66 476.54 B: you know it's like a mai- thing 

474.66 476.42 A: yeah 

476.80 483.17 B: could all those millions could have been used for a better you know in a better way 

484.25 486.97 B: i don't know i just thinking david wha- what i 

487.16 489.96 B: what do you think about it 

489.57 492.51 A: yeah i i don't know um 

494.25 504.95 A: ah i i really don't know if it was the best way to spend the money or or to spend those people's lives um 

505.01 506.75 A: i um 

507.12 510.08 A: as far as the weapons go 

510.09 518.04 A: there there is an argument that can be made tha- that whether or not weapons were found there are now um 

518.20 529.43 A: there there are there are there was plenty of reason to believe that it was the intention of iraq to dev- develop such weapons um 

529.34 534.95 A: and and that inspections would have had trouble finding them um 

535.22 544.76 A: [mn] because um i remember seeing on t._v. a show about the history of the inspections i think it said that after the first gulf war there was 

544.80 559.03 A: um a big iraqi nuclear program going on that the inspectors didn't even find out about for a long time until someone defected and told them about it and al- also it talked about how 

548.68 550.39 B: yeah 

559.02 562.42 A: after a few years iraq decided it was 

562.86 566.98 A: didn't want to cooperate with the inspectors anymore 

567.01 571.72 A: it and they ended up leaving the country and so then what do you do 

572.01 576.74 A: um so so that definitely ther- there was there was 

576.82 579.63 A: reason to worry about iraq um 

581.80 586.42 A: does does that answer your question i'm i'm not sure whether i answered it 

584.46 594.78 B: yes well yes you know you know just making conversation and ah and ah of course it does it really does it 

595.90 597.37 B: (( really does eh ah ))
