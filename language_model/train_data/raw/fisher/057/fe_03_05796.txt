38.71 39.86 B: mhm

45.33 47.26 B: oh okay how so 

46.35 48.20 A: how about how about yourself 

47.96 56.88 B: um well you know i i guess i should say this i'm i'm a gay man so when i when i hear about family for me it's a very loaded question you know 

56.23 57.35 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

57.00 61.92 B: given all the you know all all the politics behind it 

61.97 68.90 B: you know family means you know something else to me than to someone who is who is not gay so i would imagine 

68.80 73.55 A: well but it it but it it has ah it has a certain 

68.99 69.84 B: i 

73.89 81.37 A: ah meaning to you that ah that's okay i mean you know you [mn] family to you might be your your friends and ah 

77.61 78.54 B: mhm 

81.63 82.95 B: i see 

81.77 87.73 A: and assoc- associates and that that could be for someone who's not gay 

87.33 99.49 B: [mn] well you see the family to me probably i probably don't call it the word family and and when when they say family that particular word means to me you know mother father 

99.35 114.16 B: ah you know a child and ah and and you know like oh like like a family you know that kind of so i have a different connotation with it although i i value all those things that you mention ah what about you are you do you have a family am i allowed to ask you questions 

104.57 105.65 A: ah i see 

106.98 108.00 A: yeah 

109.97 110.53 A: (( [mn] )) 

113.51 114.51 A: sure

136.45 138.42 A: oh sure sure 

137.17 139.60 B: because of the distance do you visit them

143.66 147.29 A: well don't you don't you feel that she's ah close to you 

147.30 154.83 B: um that that's funny now that you're bringing this up you know i'm beginning to think you know 'cause to me initially the word meant 

154.65 164.81 B: you know wife and a husband you know but that's an extended family kind of i didn't think of that yeah i'm very close to my my sister and her family that is 

156.55 158.11 A: mm yeah 

160.24 161.29 A: yeah 

164.66 173.36 A: sure well see that's all that all becomes part of you part part of your family i mean it it it no matter how else you thought about it 

165.38 166.60 B: y- you know 

173.57 178.57 A: that that becomes ah ah a big factor do you see these people often 

178.23 192.36 B: i see i see my sister very often more so than in the past and i think because my parents actually moved to florida so now i feel that my sister is really the closest person 'cause i used to visit my fami- ah my parents 

189.96 190.79 A: (( [mn] )) 

192.57 199.75 B: very often 'cause they used to live next block to me so i used to go and eat what about you how how often do you visit your 

195.42 196.46 A: i see 

199.40 213.95 A: well we ah we have a let's see how to describe this we have the remnant remnants of what was a large family here in california um all of them have moved from the east coast out here

222.83 224.17 B: i see 

222.89 226.37 A: so it's it's like it's like the second tier 

226.94 228.57 B: i see 

227.85 233.05 A: but it's still close i mean it's it it makes no real difference about um 

233.48 240.21 A: how you feel about ah the people you know it's it's it's a very close relationship and we see each other quite often 

235.39 237.59 B: mhm
