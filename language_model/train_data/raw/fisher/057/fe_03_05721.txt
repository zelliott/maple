16.61 17.40 B: (( [noise] yeah [noise] okay )) 

22.82 25.06 A: and why you think so 

23.10 24.09 B: (( [noise] uh-uh )) 

25.28 32.13 A: so you basically just talk for ten minutes about what you think about er ah if america being threatened in any way 

32.15 33.29 A: and why 

33.87 38.86 B: okay sounds simple enough [noise] er you wanna start off you want me to or 

35.74 36.62 A: yeah 

38.72 46.85 A: em actually i can em i think that like between all the stuff we've had with like like iraq 

46.92 49.20 A: (( and like osama bin laden and all them )) 

49.21 56.07 A: em i think that there might be a threat but it's gonna be acts of terrorism like in that country 

56.10 57.20 B: (( [mn] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

56.51 62.25 A: i mean i'm not like sure that they're gonna like set off like a nuke or something 

61.63 64.33 B: mhm yeah i definitely do [noise] 

62.92 63.86 A: (( like er )) 

64.62 67.77 A: um you know it'll just be like 

67.88 70.60 A: probably like going for the big er 

71.20 74.51 A: city like er power plants and everything 

71.68 72.33 B: (( [noise] )) 

74.80 80.37 A: so i think it might be like our iraq and like everyone was worried about er north korea 

81.34 82.32 A: (( um i )) 

82.13 84.11 B: [mn] [noise] [noise] yeah i think with the 

83.02 83.97 A: (( mean i )) 

84.60 85.56 B: no go ahead 

84.80 86.40 A: oh go ahead 

86.08 97.21 B: i was gonna say i think with the terrorism threat [noise] the threats a lot a lot more [noise] with individuals not necessarily affiliated with any specific country you know [sigh] 

97.36 98.63 B: (( em [noise] )) 

99.02 105.96 B: i think you know when it comes to the terrorists that's something that can't really be pinpointed on one country necessarily [sigh] [mn] 

105.61 107.17 A: yeah exactly 

106.94 115.68 B: a lot of time i mean in terms of a specific country i don't even know where i consider the biggest threat i mean i think terrorism's the biggest threat but that's not a specific country you know [sigh] 

115.39 116.30 A: yeah 

116.20 121.91 B: er i i think north korea definitely poses a threat because they seem er 

119.06 119.95 A: (( yeah )) 

122.03 127.45 B: i mean at least their regime in charge seems er hard line enough to actually 

127.83 132.13 B: consider using you know nuclear weapons and some stuff like that 

132.32 137.30 B: but i don't know are you that familiar with the north korean situation or anything like that or [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

136.24 145.01 A: um i just like hearsay type of stuff um i just heard that they might have like three nukes or something um and 

144.96 151.14 A: you know like i don't know like i can't remember if we were in their country or we were by it or ever 

151.04 160.69 A: or like em i'm pretty sure if we get them to the point where we're killing a lot of their people or whatever i'm pretty sure they would do som- do something to us 

161.40 162.55 A: (( um )) 

163.88 169.51 A: like i'm i'm not sure like what but i mean po- possibly like the nuclear situation or whatever but 

170.99 175.55 B: yeah i mean th- either way i mean i think they're a threat on some level but um 

175.89 178.97 B: what about any any countries in the mid east um do 

179.03 181.83 B: you think one stands out above any others or 

181.72 185.08 A: um like besides iraq no 

185.32 191.64 A: um like i think like iraq and ah north korea are our biggest um 

192.35 193.85 A: enemies right now 

193.96 196.49 B: yeah it seems like iraq is pretty much er 

196.48 204.73 A: yeah they're pretty much taken care of but i mean they're still like we can't find all the nukes and stuff that supposedly mhm [noise] and 

204.84 209.56 B: yeah well that brings the whole question you know ho- how much of a threat was iraq really 

209.53 210.47 A: (( then )) 

210.02 213.34 B: considering we're having a har- hard time finding a lot of stuff out there [noise] 

214.07 219.94 A: i not really sure if like other countries that didn't help us out like if they're gonna be a threat either 

220.76 222.47 B: what was that which countries th- 

222.19 231.99 A: er i don't know it's like the ones that we asked the help for you know like france and um gee i don't know if we like asked russia or whatever but 

231.91 240.58 B: yeah i think co- yeah i i think thought i think the countries that were against the iraqi operation well you know that might have been 

232.32 233.22 A: (( i mean th- )) 

241.28 248.98 B: you know annoying to the united states i don't think any of those countries you know posed any sort of like physical threat to the united states necessarily 

249.37 258.78 B: i think that's just more like diplomatic you know disagreements as opposed to something that might result in any war or actually actual fighting or anything like that 

258.69 259.91 A: yeah 

259.28 265.22 B: but i mean you never know you know history goes in cycles and you never know what might start coming about 

264.47 267.09 A: yeah it seems to me that the only things 

267.06 280.75 A: that iraq should really have are like biological weapons you know i don't think i don't know if they have any weapons of mass destruction or anything but i mean i think i could see like all the terrorist stuff happen in the future it's like 

281.63 287.51 A: like one [noise] person doing it instead of like someone flying a plane over and just bombing them or shooting them or whatever 

287.96 289.66 B: mhm but do you do you 

288.23 289.90 A: that's what i see 

289.89 294.75 B: do you think that terrorism would be carried out by a country or [noise] just just a group you know 

293.50 298.04 A: no i think it just like by er a person representing its country 

298.90 308.13 B: yeah prob- i think it's more likely like that and also i mean [mn] i feel a little i mean i feel like i guess talking about it now i do feel kinda ignorant talking 

308.34 311.72 B: about possible threats but i know iran too is 

312.40 316.36 B: a country that i don't i don't think is in the most stable situation right now 

312.75 313.92 A: yeah 

316.54 321.95 B: and i don't think the the u._s. doesn't always take the most peaceful approach sometimes so 

316.96 317.69 A: (( no )) 

321.51 326.31 A: yeah what do you think about if er we don't like help liberia out like they want us to 

326.46 329.29 A: you think they'd like pose a threat 

329.21 335.11 B: yeah i that's one thing i [noise] totally em miss is the whole is what's going on in liberia i don't [noise] 

334.09 340.60 A: well i guess they have like a war going on between them amongst themselves and i guess the president um 

340.76 344.98 A: i don't really like know exactly what's going on but i think like the president like 

345.50 351.73 A: um he wants us to step in before he does something stupid basically that's what i'm thinking 

351.64 356.85 B: mhm but you wh- what what sort of threat is that to the united states 'cause it seems like the u._s. 

355.75 360.90 A: well i i that's what i was asking you do you think they pose a threat i mean i don't 

359.52 360.77 B: yeah 'cause i don- 

361.14 365.27 B: yeah i don't know much about it but the the u._s. historically 

361.48 362.29 A: go ahead 

365.34 373.09 B: doesn't seem to step into many situations where their interests you know aren't at stake somehow so i i would assume that there's 

370.52 371.44 A: mhm 

373.01 381.45 B: that we have some sort of er interest in liberia 'cause it seems like when the united states doesn't have an interest in a country they just kind of ignore it so 

381.42 382.49 A: (( yeah )) 

382.17 385.92 B: 'cause i think that's definitely a possibility but it's it's something er 

386.30 390.75 B: i haven't really been keeping up with the news in the last couple of [noise] months as well as i should have so 

391.28 395.03 B: i wish i could talk a- about things with a little more authority definitely 

394.42 402.59 A: yeah i know i wish i i mean most of the stuff i hear is like hearsay type of stuff so and most some of it's from my opinion too 

403.19 404.42 A: um 

405.61 406.28 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

405.83 412.45 A: i don't know like i think plus er like most of the people like in those type of countries are like civilians like us so 

412.94 413.76 A: (( you )) 

413.03 416.96 B: yeah i mean that's my biggest problem with the whol- with military operations is 

417.23 428.04 B: it's e- you know it's easy just to think of another country as an enemy but when you think of just the basic people living there it's just like anyone else you know [mn] it becomes a lot harder to justify war [noise] but i mean the other thing 

426.97 428.03 A: (( know [mn] )) 

428.57 429.42 B: no go ahead 

429.75 431.43 A: no go ahead you're you're 

431.96 433.44 B: (( no [mn] um )) 

434.04 435.76 B: what was i saying but um 

437.20 447.07 B: yeah but some i mean i think war is is sometimes justified you know depending on the threat but i just i don't see the u._s. is so down there right now with the military strength and we're spending 

447.41 459.58 B: s- such a huge amount of money on the pentagon budget it doesn't really seem like any country can even attempt to you know compete militarily so i'm not sure what country really would even threaten the united states 

459.60 464.40 A: yeah well like i don't know like if we have any nukes and i'm sure we do 

460.18 461.28 B: (( at this point )) 

464.49 465.45 A: like 

464.82 469.83 B: er but we we have more weapons of mass destruction that i think the rest of the world put together you know 

469.53 470.75 A: you think so 

470.71 472.87 B: [laughter] pretty close it it you know [noise] 

472.07 472.83 A: [laughter] 

473.49 475.96 B: which is kind of a hypocritical thing 

474.13 474.76 A: (( do )) 

475.60 479.01 A: you think we pose a threat on any other countries 

479.35 493.20 B: um why definitely if you you know kind of flip you know flip the perspective around if you look at you know just the average just the average guy in the middle east i'm sure would think of the u._s. as a huge threat to [noise] you know their their security 

493.30 496.07 B: you know if you you think of just like you know 

493.59 495.35 A: yeah 

496.37 499.73 B: living in new york city or somewhere and all of a sudden another country's 

499.71 506.26 B: dropping bombs on it you know that's that's the reality in baghdad that's the reality over there so i think [noise] 

506.10 518.24 B: you know we we in america don't r- ever really see the consequences of war and it's easy to just kind of look at it as a clean operation i think you know really it's not it it's not so clean it's not such a tidy thing 

518.63 523.36 B: and i think we're probably seen more of a threat than other countries are a threat to us 

523.87 529.86 A: yeah i mean like i don't know there was like a terrorism thing on an where are you from 

523.96 525.32 B: but [noise] 

529.42 532.04 B: [noise] [noise] i live in new york city [noise] actually 

531.47 534.21 A: new york city okay i live in er 

532.41 533.32 B: yeah 

534.29 538.68 A: er midland michigan and i don't know if you are familiar with dow chemical 

539.14 543.05 A: it's like a big power plant yeah like er that's what's basically 

539.25 540.34 B: (( yeah b- )) 

543.88 545.91 A: dow chemical and er er 

546.17 547.28 A: um 

548.76 550.11 A: (( dow )) 

548.95 549.76 B: (( but that [noise] )) 

550.55 552.36 A: (( ah and dow ah )) 

552.94 558.65 A: dow chemical and dow corning they are two power plants that we have in bay city 

559.25 560.08 A: (( so )) 

560.18 571.20 A: i mean like i guess that we were third on the list to be hit or whatever since it's such a big er power plant and everything and it'd just do a lot of damage so i mean 

567.62 569.41 B: (( mm t- [noise] )) 

571.45 579.49 A: i mean my i would be concerned too if there's terrorism here or whatever something could go wrong and blow us up for miles 

579.68 581.01 A: and miles 

580.93 583.85 B: yeah i mean that's that's the real threat when you think of 

583.88 589.95 B: what could be done you know by hitting a nuclear plant by hitting power plants by you know infecting the water supply 

590.15 591.04 B: (( you know )) 

591.57 599.87 B: i think that's the biggest threat to [noise] our security definitely i mean i have people gotten paranoid out where you live you know just 

595.58 596.36 A: yeah 

598.97 599.89 A: um
