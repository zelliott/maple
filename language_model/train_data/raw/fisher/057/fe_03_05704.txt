9.75 10.90 B: yeah 

10.68 15.03 A: okay it's a little unusual name [laughter] like mine too [laughter] 

13.77 16.09 B: yeah what's your name again 

15.82 18.49 A: marius m. a. r. i. u. s. 

17.99 19.62 B: (( okay marius )) 

19.26 20.15 A: [noise] yes 

19.95 20.90 B: okay 

20.90 21.60 A: (( now )) 

21.85 22.92 B: (( [cough] well )) 

21.88 30.30 A: today's topic was ah if i understood the er exactly it's the fight we we find some ah other countries a threat to the united states 

23.85 25.11 B: do you consider 

29.91 31.76 B: yeah 

31.09 32.93 A: mhm so 

31.90 33.72 B: um i think 

33.12 35.50 A: (( what um yep )) 

34.20 42.28 B: at this point i don't consider any country a serious threat to the united states the united states is like a world empire it's a a 

42.55 53.61 B: seems to be the dominant country militarily and in many ways economically and politically too that does as it pleases and i don't think there's a serious threat 

52.83 61.39 A: yeah i totally agree with you what er threat could be not to the country as um i don't know independent power maybe to the u._s. interests 

61.46 71.20 A: so this could be uh-hum a threat but er u._s. was never invaded so [laughter] i don't think there's every any country who'd try this 

71.21 79.18 B: right and they say that the september eleventh attack was like the you know the second attack on american soil after pearl harbour but 

79.16 80.41 A: [laughter] 

79.23 83.04 B: it's sort of ridiculous it's not the same as a- an actual invasion 

83.08 85.43 B: and there there has been no invasion 

85.47 87.41 B: it's sort of paranoia 

87.59 94.27 A: yes on september eleven wasn't an attack of um [mn] of a country it was an an attack upon an organisation 

94.78 105.55 B: right um and and although they say that it's the same thing it's really not the same thing that terrorists um attacks are not the same as war 

95.97 97.38 A: (( so [mn] )) 

105.65 109.66 B: and counter-terrorists' ah actions aren't the same as war either 

109.67 123.55 A: yes it's i i think it's totally different huh [laughter] but ah the response ah on this er terrorist attacks [laughter] was ah directly straight to countries so you see afghanistan invasion and then iraq 

119.56 120.40 B: (( oh yeah )) 

123.40 124.57 B: right 

123.53 127.40 A: and er [laughter] i don't know who's going to be next 

126.94 133.04 B: yeah countries which didn't seem to provo- er to be a serious threat to the american security 

133.28 134.75 A: mm yep 

133.44 135.90 B: i mean at least at the moment 

135.51 147.85 A: mhm yeah they they weren't but ah the attack was serving the u._s. ah interest you know [noise] they increased military spending they have no access to another source of oil 

147.57 148.95 B: yeah 

148.53 152.98 A: [mn] so [laughter] this was justified you know economically for for u._s. 

152.65 155.43 B: yeah it makes sense it's not surprising 

155.96 159.28 B: but um i guess the next thing is um 

159.51 164.26 B: you know for a while i thought they're going to invade syria or maybe not 

162.52 166.51 A: [laughter] there was a little more at some point in time 

167.22 171.26 B: does bush wanna go into liberia or is he trying to avoid it 

171.08 178.21 A: i thi- in like that he doesn't want to but um [mn] there's a a lot of pressure there's a lot of pressures from u._n. 

178.12 179.06 B: mhm 

178.26 192.37 A: you know for bush to intervene because he doesn't have any interests to to invade liberia there's nothing there you know that er u._s. can use but er there u._s. should intervene for humanitarian reasons you know 

192.76 206.74 A: because there's lot of er social unrest and er he he wants the dictator who's now is in charge ah he agrees that ah he will leave the country if u._s. comes in in the country and er stabilize er this invasion 

192.82 193.75 B: right 

206.63 207.54 B: right 

206.70 220.05 A: because there's a lot of fighting er right now there in liberia and er they cannot er they as a government they cannot er do anything they the army doesn't listen to them so everyone is looking at the u._s. as the only 

210.76 212.27 B: mhm 

220.15 224.46 A: power that can bring again peace or at least er 

224.55 227.56 A: (( i don't know at least stabilize the situation um [mn] )) 

227.96 234.20 A: in in liberia because that's why u._n. is making a lot of pressure to [mn] to u._s. to intervene 

234.34 242.04 A: (( so i think and i think finally after bush ah visited africa last week and er [mn] after the declarations of ah )) 

238.98 239.89 B: mhm 

242.07 244.12 A: (( u._s. er speaker )) 

243.85 245.58 B: mhm 

244.60 249.15 A: um i think they will intervene i think they will go there 

247.13 248.53 B: mhm 

248.75 258.28 B: yeah [noise] um i guess that the thing is as it seems like ah ah they used to talk about a few years back about the united states as the world policeman 

258.07 259.94 A: mhm 

258.43 261.72 B: it seems more like the world empire at this point 

260.73 268.11 A: [laughter] [laughter] yeah it's it's becoming more and more as an empire but i had years ago i had an interesting conversation with an indian guy 

262.17 263.26 B: like a 

267.89 268.83 B: mhm 

268.15 272.01 A: he told me that er in his opinion u._s. er 

271.86 283.79 A: was never able to be a true empire because they attacked many nations but they never colonized you know they're huh a poor colonizer if you look at the british empire or like the french or spanish or portuguese guys 

276.26 277.21 B: mhm 

283.60 284.59 B: right 

283.94 297.06 A: they they when ah they conquered the country they knew how to impose the systems there and how to make things work but er u._s. if you look at the invasion of el salvador or what they try to did do in did in cuba or in panama 

296.62 297.50 B: yeah 

296.86 300.57 A: they'll change the power but is not er putting anything in place 

300.28 306.87 B: right it's it's much more subtle maybe american colonialism is like you know it's a 

300.58 302.47 A: (( you know so )) 

306.30 308.79 A: (( [laughter] )) 

306.92 317.60 B: a more economic col- colonialism than of some movement of population or you know establishing their own political system that's directly connected to the american state 

317.60 318.28 A: (( [noise] mm )) 

318.13 329.44 A: yeah i i can understand that er but if you look at [laughter] in histories the colonial system was much more profitable for er for those nations if you look when ah u._k. ah colonized india 

328.88 329.93 B: mhm 

329.29 338.65 A: they took all the treasures for their you know they took diamonds the gold the [noise] [mn] they ah hm [laughter] they ah start ah they they took you know the 

333.77 334.70 B: right 

338.55 347.33 A: primary source for cul- for making textiles and then then they sold back up to they manufactured the textiles in england they sold this ah back to india you know 

347.13 348.12 B: right 

347.30 353.99 A: so they benefited a lot from er from all this er [laughter] colonialization of the other countries 

351.76 353.50 B: yeah 

354.23 368.08 B: but a lot of people still make the argument that american colonialism just is economic and cultural imperialism it's not qu- not in the it's not as as bad or as destructive or maybe just that it doesn't take away um 

368.37 376.50 B: the agency from people that are um under its power but you know that mcdonald's is in most countries in the world 

376.06 379.21 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

376.64 380.19 B: or something like that whatever that's worth 

379.57 383.31 A: (( [laughter] so you think this is like a colonization [laughter] )) 

382.66 384.54 B: yeah 

383.67 394.88 A: [laughter] colonization of mcdonalds yeah but you know that theory that er they say um [mn] that there's never a two part a war between er two countries they have mc- er they have mcdonald's 

395.04 395.77 B: (( huh )) 

395.80 401.24 A: [mn] so they they someone actually studied this you know because mcdonald's only entered in stable countries 

400.93 401.96 B: mhm 

401.31 407.23 A: so ah after mcdonald's entered one country that that country never entered in- into any war 

407.13 408.16 B: mhm 

407.54 411.57 A: at all so [laughter] this is a a pretty interesting theory 

411.52 414.70 B: yeah i don't know it seems like ah [mn] 

415.21 418.23 B: i wonder is there any mcdonald's in iraq now 

418.35 430.44 A: in iraq no they're not [laughter] no [laughter] [laughter] no in ah the middle east ah [mn] they i i don't know if they have in saudi arabia [noise] but they they have in lebanon 

419.82 420.74 B: yeah 

421.29 422.53 B: yeah 

427.28 428.57 B: mhm 

430.29 431.20 B: mhm 

430.58 437.10 A: (( ah where where in kuwait they have but i think now after the [laughter] war with iraq )) 

437.33 449.18 A: and er and i saw some pictures you know during the iraq war is mcdonald's [laughter] the camel is a make m. shape in form of the camel but anyway [laughter] [laughter] that's more than a joke 

446.04 448.41 B: oh yeah [laughter] 

449.01 451.25 B: yeah well it's 

450.27 450.86 A: (( mm )) 

451.08 454.04 B: it's funny that mcdonald's is a clever company that in 

453.97 467.41 B: in each country they try to provide some kind of food that all the ah palatable to the local taste not like some kind of just bringing american food to every country in the world so the food's actually different it's 

467.65 474.23 B: it's like the sensitive cultural [laughter] imperialism something like that 

471.97 472.96 A: (( mhm [laughter] )) 

473.45 479.48 A: yeah in er but they they er now they're starting to move the other way um the the other way too 

479.25 483.96 A: you er for example in india they adapted their offer to the local taste 

483.71 484.53 B: mhm 

483.81 495.31 A: and then er some other mcdonald's in some other countries starting importing some of the recipes they used in india now you have in europe some chicken er mccurry and er things like this 

490.22 492.97 B: (( mm )) 

494.85 496.43 B: oh right like in england 

495.62 505.86 A: well yeah so the these things that they only used to sell it in er in india but then there's a demand in other countries so now [laughter] they're selling er selling it too 

500.63 501.63 B: right 

505.85 513.08 A: so this er this mcdonald's invasion has er you know both you know it goes in er in both ways 

512.77 516.55 B: right so what do you think about north korea it's 

515.61 525.02 A: [noise] north korea i that's i think a country that could threat but er could pose a threat but not to u._s. but to south korea who's you know a a u._s. ah ally 

521.28 524.10 B: (( um )) 

524.94 530.67 A: (( ally i think they have ah or they're pretty close to to have nuclear weapons )) 

530.01 531.18 B: (( mm mhm )) 

530.61 532.14 A: (( but ah you know )) 

532.05 545.76 A: mhm compared to iraq they said that most of the iraqi people there er you know suppressed by power and things like this but er i think er north korea in much much worse conditions than ah than iraqi people 

545.79 546.86 B: yeah 

546.06 557.97 A: i think what's happening there it's er [noise] a lot of tragedy you know i think s- someone i don't know if u._s. or if not if not u._s. an international force should er should do something about er north korea because mm 

556.93 557.94 B: yeah 

558.52 567.19 B: because they're um the kind of proclamations that are made by the north korean government are totally crazy seeming how at least i don't know 

567.04 577.87 B: but it's still the argument that it's a threat to ah this rogue nation thing or a threat to american you know united states security is kind of farfetched it's more like the um 

578.19 587.87 B: you know the thing that israel it's an alliance that's that's binding the united states to this military um commitment i don't know 

585.82 587.70 A: (( mhm )) 

587.95 599.89 A: yeah they're not a direct threat they they cannot send their rocket a nuclear rock- rocket to to u._s. but they tested the weapons to attack japan but in er south korea it's [laughter] literally right there 

596.43 597.55 B: mhm
