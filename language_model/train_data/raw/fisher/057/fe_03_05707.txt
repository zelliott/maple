0.88 3.14 B: hello my name is matt 

2.95 8.28 A: good afternoon my name's eddy listen did you catch the the question for the topic 

5.23 6.14 B: hi 

8.22 9.39 B: yeah i did 

9.83 17.52 B: it was um do you consider any foreign countries a threat to the united states which countries and why i think 

18.34 20.76 A: okay um what's your opinion 

20.92 26.10 B: um my opinion is i i think that there are so- i i mean 

27.29 29.08 B: [mn] right now 

29.28 32.81 B: i i guess i don't feel like there's any countries that are 

32.96 36.61 B: like an imminent threat to to us um 

37.31 52.14 B: i was really worried about iraq before we went um yeah well before we went to war but ah you know now re- in retrospect i'm i'm starting to wonder if if it was as big of a deal as you know everybody made about it what d'you think 

40.59 41.55 A: to war 

42.86 43.75 A: yes 

53.46 54.52 A: um 

55.15 56.13 A: i 

56.24 61.46 A: i well you know for me um i i need to i have all my faith and trust and hope in the lord so 

61.51 73.14 A: although um it was ah really shocking to have a brother call up and say that you know these planes were burning up the twin towers well as i could do was ah 

73.13 81.48 A: just ah turn on the t._v. and and look and see them smoking away and then i think another one crashed or about to crash into it or something 

81.37 83.00 B: mhm 

81.56 93.13 A: and then ah as i could do was just see that it was of you know lining up with the word of god and as i could do is is in is just you know knew know that i had to start praying 

93.32 96.79 A: you know for this event that was going on and ah 

96.81 110.71 A: and and ah and then know that there was loss of lives and then to pray for comfort for the families ah of those that were going to end up knowing that they lost loved ones and and ah and although it seems cold well you know 

103.43 105.34 B: mhm 

111.41 124.14 A: ah os- you know that that's all i could do was pray for a while and then i went back to bed i had to get some sleep but um you know i i found out later you know a little bit more and ah and yes i was concerned but ah 

115.96 117.35 B: yeah 

124.46 129.09 A: you know it just it just you know showed me that um our nation is ah 

129.61 132.67 A: you know needed to get a like a wake up call 

132.57 133.53 B: mhm 

133.02 147.84 A: and that's the way i interpreted it and i perceived it and and so you know i just believed that since we knew that it was ah iraq that did it or over if you know from from that country that then of course we were going to take immediate aggressive action 

147.42 148.83 B: mhm 

147.97 159.46 A: and um so i wasn't surprised about you know saying you know do this or do that or we're going to go to war with you and then you know they just you know just laughed at us or blew it off and whatever 

158.48 159.73 B: yeah 

159.41 164.32 A: and ah trying to make fools of us thinking that we maybe weren't i don't know what they thought but ah 

164.16 175.49 A: so when we did i was like all i could do was you know praying for the right things even an easy thing that he might ah try to bail out and then we could just go in without him there because you know he that i had heard that he was trying to go 

175.53 183.51 A: he'd tried to he had a plane entourage ready to go out at some other time but then he he cancelled that ah hu- hu- 

179.91 182.69 B: who who are you talking who are you talking about now 

183.85 185.00 A: (( hudan )) 

184.26 185.92 B: hussein saddam 

184.95 199.87 A: yeah and and but he didn't go when he could have so i was just hoping and praying that if this time around that maybe he would make arrangements and he'd get out of there then we could just walk in and just start to you know rebuild and you know reconstruct whatever but he didn't and so that's why the war but ah 

192.95 194.18 B: yeah 

196.96 198.10 B: yeah 

199.85 203.01 A: so but i'd have to agree with you i don't think that there's um 

203.33 214.21 A: anything that's really an imminent threat because you know they were with what they were doing but has since they're they're no longer a a power a that's ah to be feared 

207.93 209.17 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

214.29 223.28 A: um i think that that we're basically pretty safe especially since you know that just put the the united states on its toes to be 

223.08 235.55 A: you know ah more cautious with warnings ah about other places and you know because i guess we had been warned about him but ah the military chiefs just said oh that's not going to happen and they blew it off 

235.42 244.24 A: and they overlooked it and it's the same way then to to to you know with the space shuttle they had warned about that about it's equipment and stuff 

237.32 238.58 B: yeah 

244.00 255.18 A: but they just thought well you know somebody else will do something if they want to it's not a big thing it it's always made it you know what i mean it'll make it and then look what happened so it's the same thing so you know all you know with the with that ah 

249.37 251.23 B: yeah yeah 

251.64 253.43 B: yeah 

256.02 264.41 A: so i believe that it just put us on our toes so that we would be cautious about you know all that's ah against us as a nation that's for ah israel [mn] 

265.54 267.30 B: yeah 

265.57 280.02 A: and i don't see really any im- imminent ah you know things coming about except you know the i am looking for ah the lord's return so you know i'm wanting to be you know in prayer and you know an example 'cause that's what i'm called to do 

280.14 281.39 B: right 

281.29 283.27 A: (( but um i'm )) 

283.41 285.82 A: i'm um i'm glad that um 

286.01 295.45 A: that ah it didn't take too long i i had been a over ah for about an hour and ah ten minutes waiting for ah one call and i never got it so i hung up the other day 

295.56 296.80 A: but um 

297.33 299.76 A: i i i'm um 

300.67 302.45 A: you know i i just um 

302.83 306.64 A: i'm not a you know very much of a great talker but um 

306.70 314.32 A: you know um i like to believe that we're relatively safe from ah intruders and invaders in the way of terrorists 

313.98 315.58 B: yeah 

314.71 318.91 A: but um that really did shake us up ah with all that had happened um 

318.47 320.17 B: yeah 

319.22 321.02 A: you know i'm just ah 

321.40 334.63 A: i'm just praying that er we might all learn something from it and we all might grow to be a better er country you know the united states and oth- other people ah although i don't think there'll ever be peace i i think that we could still you know 

334.84 341.88 A: learn how to live with each other until ah until that there's you know the the return of the lord or 

342.75 343.93 A: or until ah 

342.99 350.81 B: how do you suppose we'll do we'll ah do that do you suppose we'll all ah if we were all christians do you suppose that would happen or if we were all ah one religion 

352.10 355.52 A: well you know i i do i do believe that ah [mn] 

356.08 357.37 A: (( that ah )) 

357.48 366.35 A: that jesus was a a son of man and a son of god i i do believe he was sent of god to ah show us how to be you know to learn he 

365.20 373.13 B: yeah but yeah i'm i'm with you i'm a christian but i i you're not answering my question i mean how how do you suppose that peace will happen i'm not i'm not 

371.75 374.48 A: i i don't think that there'll ever be peace 

374.71 375.63 B: no 

375.41 385.25 A: no um not not real peace i i believe that there'll just be you know sporadic ah moments in in the in hope but um 

385.07 391.01 A: well you know with mankind ah you know we're all evil and wicked from from from birth so we can't you know 

389.63 390.88 B: yeah 

391.43 397.42 A: w- unless you have ah the lord as your savior you're you're not looking to being better you know 

396.19 402.26 B: so what about those well what about those arabs then how do you feel about them i mean do you suppose they're looking to be better or 

402.67 413.67 A: i really i really believe that um i i'm i love them but i mean i happen to know by the word of god you you don't try to kill in order to get what you want 

413.46 414.64 B: well i mean 

413.83 417.63 A: so i i believe their philosophy up- upon ah g- you know 

417.84 428.43 B: what about our philosophy though i mean you know what we want what we want is peace and security right i mean our philosophy is hey you know you slam planes into our world trade centre 

418.03 421.27 A: the their view of god is is is wrong 

423.34 425.11 A: yeah 

428.27 433.94 B: ah we're going to come after you well how do you feel about that isn't that killing to get what we want which is peace 

433.85 437.91 A: you know that's a pretty tough question i mean um 

437.94 443.44 A: you you do unto others ah do unto others as you would have others do unto you but i also believe 

443.27 453.46 A: that that that you never repay evil with evil and so that's where i believe it's a fine line that um i mean w- i believe we we with 

446.94 448.20 B: yeah 

453.73 460.33 A: let us go in and get these things or give 'em up and we'll take 'em out and hey then then no problem but see they didn't wanna comply 

458.16 459.84 B: yeah 

460.20 471.52 A: so then i i would have to believe that that the lord spoke to bush to all the people that ah d'you know like [mn] well known like you know billy graham ah all these godly men 

471.39 484.06 A: that that said well i believe the lord says you know give 'em the warnings if they don't then go in and and he took that advice and and so that's why that happened i believe that the lord you know was basically led us into it 

483.19 484.59 B: i see so 

484.55 494.68 B: i- well what you would say then is ah if ah if an arab receives a ah a signal from allah that says to go place or to go 

494.46 506.60 B: crash planes into the world trade centre that that's not okay but for a christian man such as bush to receive a message from god that says go into iraq and deal with evil that that's okay 

507.89 517.43 A: to deal with evil ah to ah to eliminate evil yes from a growing from a growing because ah they ah were 

512.81 514.17 B: (( all right )) 

515.89 524.75 B: do you suppose that do you suppose that allah then speaks to ah arabs in the same way that god speaks to christians let's say 

524.58 527.71 A: you know i i really would have to ah 

528.92 534.74 A: well um you know i well they they they apparently truly believe in the koran 

535.11 540.74 B: right well then they truly believe in god i mean the god of the old testament the christians do as well 

535.13 536.33 A: so 

540.14 543.27 A: yeah but he's he's a different god 

544.33 549.46 A: they don't they don't have the view of of god who sent his son 

549.80 553.18 A: that i i can't think of what their philosophy is but ah 

549.98 550.95 B: right 

553.38 561.56 A: there's something missing in their in their viewpoint of god because as you know god would not ah 

562.61 566.20 A: command his children to [noise] to go 

566.27 570.77 A: and and ruthlessly ah kill to um 

571.62 573.32 A: [mn] to just um 

573.81 577.57 A: set upon his will and his plans you know 

577.54 585.54 B: well i mean unless unless according to what you say god indeed told bush to go root out these guys and then murder is okay right 

585.87 588.84 A: i believe that he did um 

588.96 596.89 A: allow his voice to be heard to rise up against the evil that was trying to grow into the land and to try ta 

597.14 599.89 A: you know have an influence on those that want
