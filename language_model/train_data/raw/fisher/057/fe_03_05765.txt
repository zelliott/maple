41.27 46.02 B: high school i was taking a civil engineering class and we used computers um 

46.03 49.66 B: to help us ah with um with design you know cab auto cabs [lipsmack] 

49.48 50.45 A: (( [noise] )) 

49.88 62.34 B: and it was an invaluable tool you know without that [noise] then um i i don't feel that um i could've really learnt anything about the [noise] topic so [noise] you know so the internet helps us reaches i know in college it's been a most valuable tool so [noise] 

61.91 64.68 A: yeah i think our generation is spoiled by computers 

64.66 65.73 B: [noise] i'm sorry 

65.28 68.47 A: i said i think our generation is kinda spoiled by computers 

68.23 75.85 B: [noise] you know i really actually can't hea- ah understand very well what you're saying it just it comes through kinda of um [noise] loud and u- u- u- unintelligible 

75.35 78.16 A: hold on let me turn see if i can turn my volume down one second [noise] 

78.18 79.05 B: okay

82.37 83.17 A: (( okay )) 

83.52 87.31 A: yeah i said i think that our generation is spoiled by computers [noise] 

87.14 91.73 B: [noise] well i mean it's true if you look at um you know are are are you in college by any chance [noise] 

91.35 94.37 A: no i'm done i graduated about three years ago [noise] [noise] [noise] 

94.24 101.55 B: oh okay well i i'm i've i've only got another year left and um you know i i i've i basically was thinking about it actually 

101.70 109.06 B: [lipsmack] when i was writing a report about um about um deferential association for a um criminology class i was taking [noise] 

109.77 117.49 B: how um the paper that took me [noise] about five hours to research because all i could do was go to eds com host and type in um 

118.33 131.49 B: you know type in um deferential association was taking me days or not weeks to research by actually sifting through a library and now all the all the articles um from the ah different journals are um online it's just wonderful [noise] [noise] 

130.72 140.04 A: oh yeah you're right absolutely though i think that when the when i was in high school though i used to create entire papers in some classes just copying things off the internet 

140.03 148.60 B: right right well yeah definitely i i agree with that that we're um [sigh] we're a bit spoiled by it but i think it it makes it easier to learn 

140.74 141.94 A: [laughter] 

148.80 150.47 B: it also makes it easier to cheat 

151.23 154.48 A: oh i a right absolutely i think teachers are more 

154.50 163.67 A: savvy about that but like 'cause the internet was was i'm trying to think when i was in high school it wasn't that long ago but people didn't do a lot of research online 

156.68 158.47 B: (( [noise] )) 

160.09 162.55 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

163.58 164.79 B: (( right )) 

164.03 169.71 A: so you could just copy and paste things and people in and as long as you cited it at the end with the website address 

166.34 167.40 B: [noise] 

169.16 171.83 B: mhm [noise] [noise] 

169.94 175.43 A: that was considered cracked but i don't think that that's tru- i don't think that that's like kosher nowadays but 

173.71 179.11 B: [noise] well i know in college you could you could your whole paper could be um 

179.28 182.55 B: somebody's elses as long as you um cite everything 

181.96 184.21 A: (( [laughter] exactly yeah totally )) 

184.01 185.12 B: [noise] 

185.15 193.45 A: yeah but i think i mean i would be s- i i can't i gather there are some people that learn without computers like you know like third world countries and stuff 

193.53 194.81 B: right 

194.11 199.26 A: but now i think it's a problem i think people use the calc- the calculators and computers to do math 

198.65 203.27 B: [noise] [noise] well yeah [noise] 

199.48 200.34 A: that's 

201.86 205.48 A: they don't learn how to do them by ei- i don't they don't know how to math by themselves 

206.55 214.50 B: yeah well i i i always think um spell check would be also another problem and gra- grammar checks [noise] well like i know me and my my entire um 

210.08 211.50 A: [laughter] 

214.68 220.77 B: ability to spell was was killed by computers i would just you know every time i wrote a paper i would i would put down um 

220.94 230.82 B: [lipsmack] a tend- you know ah ah put down ah you know a spell check and everything would be corrected and i know i have friends and i'm like i have i have good grammar but um i have friends of my mine ah who um 

230.99 244.20 B: who ah have terrible terrible grammar and um they use spell checking and it makes them seem like they're capable when really when really if they had to write anything by hand they would be totally [noise] un- incapable of um 

237.51 239.38 A: (( [noise] yes exactly )) 

244.26 246.82 B: totally incapable of um of doing that 

246.48 251.36 A: yeah the question is can they write anything by hand 'cause everybody types everything nowadays so 

247.92 248.59 B: [noise] 

250.23 252.46 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

251.89 254.97 A: you don't have to actually like write papers out or anything like that [noise] 

255.21 263.66 B: right well you know i i used to um [lipsmack] i used to work for um for for the city and you would see the same person's memorandum 

263.74 267.17 B: ah how they wrote it and then they'd write write something by hand with the memo 

267.26 275.16 B: and um two different things i mean the spelling and grammar are just so different you could tell that they had to have somebody type it for them or or or they use spell check 

275.14 287.39 A: right exactly so yeah i think yeah i use my computer constantly i email constantly and i'm on the internet constantly i i don't think i'd i'd whenever i go on vacation i'm always surprised that i can live without it but 

276.63 277.70 B: (( do you do you )) 

286.68 288.44 B: (( mhm [noise] right )) 

288.09 294.09 A: and i guess it i guess it's today's students will be just even worse than we are than i was so 

293.67 307.57 B: [noise] right well i i um i just [noise] got back from study abroad in spain for a month [noise] and in new york i check my emails twice a day and there i was checking it um you know every three days and i felt very withdrawn and and deprived and um you know 

306.55 307.55 A: [laughter] 

307.82 308.62 B: [noise] so 

308.03 319.55 A: okay well when i used to i studied abroad in england and we used to like all my classes the computer lab used to be open until eleven so we would also try we'd always like all the american students you know they stay at the end of the day sitting in a computer lab checking their email 

319.09 321.27 B: [noise] right but 

319.95 322.60 A: when the british students were going out so 

322.01 323.58 B: you studi- you studied in london 

323.89 327.66 A: no i studied in south hampton which is south of south of london [noise] [noise] 

326.90 329.45 B: right i i studied in madrid and um 

329.48 339.53 B: and um you know a definitely they had an intranet caf but just the lines to get on to this fr- free intranet at school were long [noise] because the spanish apparently were using the the internet more than we were 

339.65 347.14 B: [noise] um so i had to pay for it and you know when you're a student you only have so much money to to pay for the intranet and it was quite pricey so [noise] like 

347.18 354.73 A: yeah that's funny i but you know it was funny because when i studied over there we had our computers were like they're like five years behind the computers in the u._s. 

355.01 356.17 B: right 

355.58 367.46 A: like for what our univers- like when i went to the university of maine what the university of maine had compared to what this school had and they thought they were like new and fancy and stuff like that but i mean they were like completely behind they were so proud but we used to make fun of them 

363.45 364.23 B: (( right [noise] )) 

367.27 371.30 B: (( [laughter] what kind of com- what what ah what do you use back then )) 

368.15 369.43 A: [laughter] 

371.41 372.90 A: what's that 

373.16 376.44 B: what what do you use back there operating system 

375.85 379.62 A: oh i have no idea probably win- like windows ninety eight or something like that 

379.04 380.10 B: (( oh okay )) 

380.60 388.60 A: maybe it's windows ninety five they were older computers and like it was just weird how you had to conn- you know like how you had to connect with them and stuff like that it wasn't like 

380.66 381.66 B: yeah 'cause 

388.31 389.65 B: (( [noise] well )) 

388.66 390.79 A: it wasn't like what we had 

390.55 393.76 B: i i i got so used to flat screens in my school 

393.03 393.90 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

393.84 401.19 B: that you know it it was pretty weird for me getting used to the internet using an optical mouse's even ah cordless cordless mou- mouse and stuff 

399.90 402.99 A: okay yeah you're you're spoilt [laughter] 

402.72 416.51 B: [noise] well no you know it it was just you know with the cordless mouse it was kinda weird you know um you know it it it's not that i had to get used to something else but um it was just it was just different you know 'cause my school has has very um modern [noise] computers and they just brought new ones last year 

416.95 429.95 A: interesting i think our i i school have like a pretty new computer lab it wasn't quite that it wasn't quite that new but and like i don't know i think it's just funny how you can how amer- american's are very dependent on their email and stuff like that and so 

421.72 424.27 B: [noise] right 

430.01 432.12 B: (( [noise] well you know um )) 

431.53 433.85 A: [noise] i am i completely admit it
