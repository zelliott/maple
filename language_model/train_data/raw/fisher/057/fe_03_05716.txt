0.00 2.42 B: [lipsmack] hello hi this is brett 

0.62 1.62 A: (( [noise] hi )) 

2.76 3.99 A: hi i'm mike 

3.90 5.83 B: hey mike [noise] um 

5.22 7.09 A: (( [noise] i i'm sorry what was your name [noise] )) 

6.71 8.03 B: (( ah brett [sigh] y- )) 

7.85 9.19 A: brett [noise] okay 

9.04 15.47 B: yeah [sigh] i was trying to i don't know if i heard exactly what the question was ah toward the end [sigh] u- um like it [noise] [noise] 

14.24 16.26 A: (( [noise] y- yeah it was a- ah )) 

16.91 24.56 A: i- is there any country that's a t- threat to the united states and if so what country and and why or something like that 

23.98 30.68 B: yeah yeah to the security i guess is the word i couldn't understand i see yeah [sigh] well um [lipsmack] 

26.36 28.08 A: right right to the security 

28.44 29.58 A: (( uh-hum )) 

30.88 34.11 B: yeah i mean i guess [sigh] i guess i believe that ah 

34.24 41.78 B: [sigh] that korea for example c- could be ah you know perceived as a threat ah simply because of its ability [sigh] 

36.67 38.46 A: (( [mn] y- yeah yeah [sigh] )) 

41.84 43.13 B: to ah 

43.25 45.49 B: ah to develop nuclear weapons 

45.46 46.27 A: uh-huh 

45.66 49.15 B: unless we've all been bluffed into that too [laughter] 

48.15 51.27 A: [laughter] [sigh] yeah that's true [sigh] [sigh] 

49.27 50.16 B: i don't know 

50.42 52.46 B: (( [sigh] well what do you think )) 

51.85 59.19 A: um well i think i mean without a doubt the u._s. military is you know far superior to um 

59.22 63.19 A: you know much of the rest of the world's military combined even [sigh] 

62.69 63.88 B: (( uh-hum [noise] )) 

63.19 75.94 A: but um i still think like nations like you know north korea and ah and even like possibly like iran [sigh] or syria you know like should they continue to ah [sigh] sponsor terrorism y- you know possibly develop 

75.91 89.50 A: you know weapons of mass destruction they could [sigh] they could pose a threat maybe not directly to the united states but um at the very least to y- you know ah vital interests of the united states you know like regional allies or 

87.31 88.10 B: right 

89.43 91.43 A: (( [sigh] you know things like that [mn] [noise] )) 

91.00 96.41 B: [noise] [sigh] true i i i think that ah you mentioned iran and that was one actually i thought of ah 

96.93 106.27 B: when i first heard the question because um simply because of the region and because of [noise] [sigh] what sort of threat could exist in that area um 

105.59 106.97 A: yeah 

106.28 111.25 B: you know and the fact that there's so much potentially [sigh] a problem but ah 

110.45 122.31 A: yeah yeah no it's definitely true have you been following this is a little l- like side of the topic i guess but like [sigh] have you been following the the recent news like with a with iran like the student protests and things like that [noise] [noise] 

121.70 127.24 B: [sigh] you know i haven't no ah what are they [sigh] protests of the current government or 

127.08 139.22 A: [noise] yeah there's like a lot of um like like like s- students who are protesting against like the um you know the clerical rule [sigh] but the the stupid thing that's going on is like ah [sigh] is ah 

127.41 127.97 B: (( [noise] )) 

134.95 136.08 B: yeah 

139.21 149.37 A: the united states like president bush keeps speaking out [sigh] in favor of the protestors which totally just undermines the whole [laughter] protestors' cause [sigh] 

149.18 160.68 A: 'cause even the protestors like they want reform and they want m- more o- of a democratic state [sigh] from most you know most of them they don't like the clerical rule and they're protesting against that they're mostly students [sigh] 

160.13 161.75 B: right 

160.67 169.47 A: but um but by the united states publicly like endorsing them that's you know they they they want democracy but they still hate the united states yeah 

168.90 170.86 B: (( interesting [noise] yeah well ah [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

169.56 181.32 A: that gives ah [sigh] the government you know a a reason t- to to get more people against the protestors because they're like look they're u._s. puppets [sigh] you know like the u._s. are supporting what they're doing [sigh] 

180.63 181.90 B: right [sigh] 

181.20 189.02 A: and everyone hates the united states there anyway so it's just [sigh] undercuts the whole t- thing i think that's ri- just ridiculous that they 

188.33 199.55 B: i agree and and and i think one of the the the difficulties there is that the perception by those [sigh] protestors that [sigh] ah statements of support would be perceived um 

199.90 201.67 B: (( [lipsmack] ah as ah )) 

201.97 209.66 B: [sigh] more h- hurting them than helping i- is a product i believe of [sigh] perhaps how we've postured ourselves internationally anyway um 

208.98 210.07 A: yeah 

209.70 217.58 B: and obviously that that ah i think stems from a- ah our war in iraq but [sigh] the notion that somehow um 

210.21 211.31 A: (( good point [noise] right )) 

217.64 231.61 B: you know something that we say as a nation to them [sigh] ah is seen as offensive [noise] i think [noise] is is a problem internationally that we have to [noise] try to figure out how to [sigh] how to remedy um and that was one thing i was really troubled by about the whole [sigh] 

224.69 226.00 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

231.82 235.99 B: action in iraq i suspect that ultimately e- even if [sigh] 

236.00 246.03 B: [noise] even if ah there had been continued diplomacy or continued ah [noise] weapons inspections [sigh] [noise] the idea would have been [noise] that ah [noise] they would've tried [sigh] 

245.97 260.72 B: ah to do something diplomatically but ultimately would have p- probably gone to war anyway the notion [noise] though of i think is that i- it least would have had [sigh] more international support doing it [sigh] and less protests like you say [noise] of those in iran who 

251.76 252.70 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

260.55 266.00 B: [noise] theoretically we agree with and they agree with us [sigh] but they can't stomach the notion of us 

266.23 268.24 B: b- bullying i guess [noise] 

267.62 274.92 A: yeah yeah i agree with you a- ah especially like you know with the iraq thing like it was it was definitely something that probably would've 

274.94 283.46 A: was at that point like pretty much inevitable [sigh] despite like whatever kind of diplomatic riddles there was like with the security council or whatever but 

282.91 284.60 B: right right 

283.79 284.90 A: like a- ah 

284.92 286.56 A: there's definitely a kind of 

286.83 300.13 A: something that [sigh] you know even if even if the united states had have made a big deal about it probably within the next few months or you know at the most like the next year or two like saddam would have done something just to instigate us further you know so uh-hum 

299.36 309.97 B: right [sigh] yeah i i a- and um or at least been exposed internationally for um [sigh] you know the the menace that he [noise] 

310.16 319.25 B: was e- even if it means he didn't have weapons of as one as o- others suspected [sigh] ah there would have been o- other things that would have happened that would have made him 

319.37 321.83 B: [sigh] i think um a- 

321.86 330.88 B: ah [sigh] i think even the french and the germans t- to some extent would concede that [sigh] a change was needed i think they had a d- difference on how the change should come about 

329.41 331.53 A: (( yeah i think t- that's true )) 

331.11 337.80 B: [sigh] and and then how did that carry over [noise] to ah other countries now that are ah 

337.99 344.03 B: [sigh] you know ah we may perceive as a threat just by the slightest thing we do may 

342.57 343.51 A: yeah 

344.05 347.21 B: may prompt something other than iran and and ah 

347.63 349.78 B: [sigh] korea are there are others that you 

349.88 351.73 B: that you wonder about 

351.84 362.62 A: [noise] [noise] i don't ah i don't know like [mn] i mean definitely iran korea and ah i mean there's definitely been talk lately a a little bit about syria [sigh] you know mostly because they 

355.15 355.84 B: (( [sigh] )) 

362.55 372.40 A: they're they're known to support terrorists you know whether they're probably not like al qaeda but they [sigh] support a lot of palestinian terrorists and things like [noise] that 

372.14 381.12 B: [noise] right [sigh] so those who would support terrorists then you believe would be a threat do you really b- believe that or have we been led to believe that [sigh] 

373.02 374.56 A: so it could be 

381.29 389.13 B: i- in because of september eleven ah these are they really threats i mean i i have a hard time understanding exactly what that threat is 

389.12 397.16 A: [noise] [sigh] yeah i know like like iran f- for e- example is like a a huge supporter of ah hezbollah which is like you know 

389.54 390.66 B: how real is it 

396.01 397.18 B: (( [noise] [noise] uh-hum [noise] )) 

397.00 409.76 A: one of the b- bigger palestinian terrorist groups and [sigh] you know they they deny that they support these terrorist groups but [sigh] these terrorist groups probably wouldn't exist if it wasn't f- for like this this financial backing 

409.42 410.40 B: (( uh-hum )) 

409.73 417.13 A: and like whereas they may not act as a as an arm of the state you know the terrorist groups are acting pretty much ind- independently but [sigh] 

417.00 425.38 A: you know through a round about way they're also serving like iran's interests you know that's why iran continues to support them financially 

425.11 426.45 B: (( uh-hum )) 

425.78 429.23 A: so there's ah you know it's like it's kind of 

429.63 443.97 A: i i don't know it's kind of a toss up like you know is iran a t- threat or is even that terrorist group a threat directly to the united states [sigh] like [sigh] you know like i highly doubt that they would a- directly attack the united states 'cause i think they [noise] know especially now that like the u._s. 

436.95 437.62 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

443.83 446.40 A: will t- track you down wherever you are you know 

446.04 449.24 B: right it's becoming more difficult i think to d- define 

449.47 458.67 B: the actual threat even even when you thought in terms of iraq it wasn't iraq that was a threat [sigh] it was a man it was s- saddam hussein 

451.06 452.64 A: (( uh-hum yeah exactly )) 

456.86 459.38 A: right yeah that's a good point [noise] [noise] 

458.64 467.42 B: [sigh] um and a- a- ah you know in in in now with everybody s- supposedly supporting terrorism 

467.72 473.02 B: [sigh] ah i don't know exactly what that means and who it points to and and ah 

473.39 475.25 B: [sigh] i don't know it seems to me that it 

475.66 479.49 B: we've we've made it more difficult to d- define our enemies as a result 

478.37 483.00 A: y- yeah and and i think it also h- has created a dangerous s- situation whereas like 

482.84 485.71 A: all too easily now politicians can 

485.55 487.14 A: [sigh] accuse 

486.90 499.39 A: so or w- whatever country or whatever group of you know ties to t- terrorism and that immediately [sigh] you know kind of black lists them in the eyes of the public when in reality there may not be that that connection or that tie [sigh] 

499.22 510.86 A: or may be there is a terrorist tie there but it it's you know to such a small extent that it's not [sigh] a threat but now they're so much better it can build up against t- terrorism like this idea of terrorism that [noise] [sigh] 

511.17 519.06 A: it may get us involved in things that you know are really not like in a you know the vital interests of of the united states you know 

518.79 529.53 B: [noise] [noise] yeah which is [noise] w- why i had i bel- i i agree i mean it's why i believe that [sigh] a sort of new generation of united nations international um 

529.84 531.10 B: [lipsmack] um 

531.89 539.70 B: diplomatic ah or international body [sigh] ah would help sort through [noise] those issues so that 

539.71 546.32 B: [sigh] singularly the united states doesn't [mn] declare you know a blacklisted you know [sigh] 

546.22 555.84 B: terrorism nation [sigh] or terrorist leading a nation [sigh] and um everyone else perceives our actions as as ah 

548.04 548.86 A: (( uh-huh y- )) 

556.08 561.81 B: [sigh] either a colonial type um action or or an act of aggression or 

561.83 565.15 B: [sigh] without some sort of international c- cooperation i 

564.75 565.95 A: yeah 

565.43 571.68 B: i think that p- poses a problem and and although you can't use the current structure because the u._n. is 

571.70 575.35 B: [sigh] and has been for decades fairly [mn] inept [sigh] [noise] 

574.98 584.77 A: [sigh] yeah i t- that's true [sigh] i don't know like you know what i i agree with you but it it's kind of scary 'cause you know i don't [sigh] think there's really much of a 

584.76 595.28 A: consensus that among at least you know the the people who make those kind of decisions that it needs to be changed fundamentally [noise] or that a new organization needs to 

595.09 599.89 A: [sigh] replace it i think the united states like at least the government i mean has ah has lost so much
