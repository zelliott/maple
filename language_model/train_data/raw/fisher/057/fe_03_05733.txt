99.14 100.31 A: (( ah i guess er )) 

100.63 103.89 B: right of course but unfortunately you know it's that 

104.50 108.27 B: you know a lot of the schools don't have them 'cause they can't afford them 

107.67 109.08 A: (( yeah no that's )) 

108.29 114.71 B: you know so that's the biggest problem so it's you know how do you get the you know you know the question is how you get the computer into everybody's

116.52 117.80 A: sure sure 

117.15 127.01 B: but it's like it's like you know you ju- you just have to have them th- there's you you don't go into an office and there's no computer i mean whatever you're going to do 

127.38 131.52 B: you know i mean even auto auto mechanics use mechanics nowadays 

131.47 132.85 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

131.82 136.23 B: you know to fix cars so i mean y- you just have know what to do with a computer [noise] 

137.42 138.24 B: (( so um )) 

138.63 143.23 B: [noise] so i don't any i don't think anyone would er would argue with that 

142.81 150.72 A: [noise] and i i really don't see how er [noise] having er computers in the classroom can er can harm anything er whatsoever 

150.49 151.93 B: mhm mhm 

151.04 154.27 A: [mn] sure you can get in trouble with a computer but you know

161.37 162.35 A: oh right [noise] 

163.26 164.24 B: um 

164.39 166.61 B: and rightfully so i mean you know the 

166.60 180.74 B: the government's very concerned that the people who work for it you know are not misusing are not spending all day on the internet um and looking at porn sites [laughter] or or or following their trading their stocks and bonds um which people do 

174.46 175.40 A: uh-huh 

181.13 184.07 B: at work which they shouldn't be doing [laughter] i guess 

182.98 183.86 A: (( true )) 

184.12 190.78 B: um i i know some people here have been disciplined for that um so you know it's [mn] 

190.98 195.14 B: you need it but then you have to have it you know controlled 

194.07 196.60 A: yeah and then there's the case of er 

197.43 204.69 A: [noise] e- exposing a system to er viruses and any other kind of damaging programs [noise] 

200.78 201.87 B: (( mhm )) 

204.18 210.58 B: right right right of course of course yeah w- with the thing being networked it's so easy to er i guess spread

206.29 206.99 A: (( [noise] )) 

211.24 213.11 B: and then you know getting all these

232.72 234.99 B: [lipsmack] my i have access to a._o._l. 

234.87 235.67 A: uh-huh 

235.68 241.44 B: and i'll get a you know look at my email through a._o._l. and there'll be messages for me 

241.51 243.96 B: s- someone using my 

244.05 245.63 B: user name 

245.00 246.25 A: oh right 

246.52 249.53 B: i you know as i- as if i sent myself some mail 

247.39 250.26 A: [laughter] you can't black it [laughter] uh-huh 

250.23 261.37 B: you know and this true the first time i saw it it was really sick i said did i send myself [laughter] an email i'm getting something from someone with the same us- user name as me and it's not possible so somehow they did they're using 

261.44 265.26 B: these advertisers are using your own email a- name 

265.86 267.52 B: you know to send you things 

265.92 267.20 A: (( yeah you know )) 

267.64 272.20 A: i i i get a couple of those every now and again and it's pretty messy because 

270.63 272.01 B: mhm

279.66 280.69 A: [laughter] 

280.62 284.41 B: yeah and then even the pop ups i mean i just and the 

283.15 291.86 A: oh that's the worst thing any pop up stoppers are you know either a service you gotta pay for itself or i i've yet to find a free one 

289.48 290.54 B: mhm 

291.71 303.01 B: right but you would think you know i'm paying twenty five dollars a month for a._o._l. and i think for that twenty five dollars i think i'm [mn] i i should expect them to block them you know 

296.53 297.38 A: (( ahah )) 

302.75 304.65 A: (( yeah or at least the majority )) 

302.77 307.00 B: i mean maybe i'm being unreasonable i don't know [laughter] 

305.47 311.41 A: right right and since you're paying for content you know they they stick it to you with all the ads anyway 

308.67 309.64 B: uh-huh 

311.19 314.73 B: right right right um so i mean 

314.94 320.32 B: i i you know the only reason i really use a._o._l. anyway is to access the internet i don't even know why i 

320.48 324.85 B: why i even bother you know 'cause you you can get free email 

324.66 325.54 A: right 

324.89 327.01 B: with things like hot hot mail
