172.39 174.39 A: that ah 

174.72 185.40 A: um united states didn't expect that to happen but but i mean i thought saudi i feel i don't think really think saudi arabia's much of a threat 

185.39 190.42 A: apparently right now it's the arab countries that that seem to be much of a threat 

190.44 192.17 A: um 

192.37 196.00 B: well saudi arabia's a a a an arab country 

195.39 197.98 A: yeah well i don't think 

198.02 201.56 A: they're like they're radical you know what i mean 

200.88 209.99 B: well see the way that i understand it is basically ah the folks who are in power over there pretty much pay ah the terrorists 

210.27 220.89 B: ah basically to leave them alone and turn a blind eye so that you know they can train and they can do their their money thing and so long as they don't bother them 

214.76 215.66 A: mhm 

220.91 223.82 B: they won't you know they won't raise a fuss 

223.15 230.28 A: well see china's a ho- a sore spot and because they support north korea 

230.50 233.69 A: you know that's that's north korea's a 

233.94 237.85 A: may be a problem and um 

237.94 240.44 A: lately i think um 

240.50 244.44 A: france is kind of getting like pro anti american 

244.12 247.34 B: yeah but what's what's what's france going to do really 

246.26 249.17 A: i i know they really can't 

247.90 249.79 B: [laughter] 

249.22 256.02 A: they i know they're like really can't do that they're kinda weak they're not a real big threat country but um 

255.28 259.32 B: noodle armed choir boys as they say on a on the simpson's 

259.34 260.42 A: what's that 

259.83 266.54 B: [laughter] oh willy the janitor on the simpson's calls the calls the french noodle armed ah choir boys 

266.67 271.57 A: oh i must have missed that one all right but um 

267.14 268.80 B: [laughter] 

271.27 273.05 B: yeah i'm not worried about france 

272.63 281.28 A: no i'm not worried about france i'm trying to think you know like could be some african countries um south africa of 

281.24 287.73 A: oh it used to be cuba but i don't think cuba's much of a threat because there's no soviet union 

287.67 301.05 A: doing any aggravation right now you know to antagonize them the cubans but um i'm trying to think of some maybe some african countries might um um 

291.41 292.47 B: right 

301.27 306.10 A: be ah involved too you know [mn] um right 

305.10 317.31 B: yeah well i was sort of surprised to find out how i i i guess it's just my ignorance of of ah the distribution of religions around the world but apparently ah there's a huge muslim pop- population that's 

317.41 319.63 B: um you know basically 

319.96 325.09 B: you know intertwined with with all of the the the middle eastern countries and 

323.88 325.30 A: right right 

325.15 330.99 B: you know i as as far as countries themselves go being a threat i don't i don't 

331.03 341.49 B: know that i see a country being ah the threat as much as i see um fanatical individuals and i mean they can be from anywhere and not necessarily even have 

337.71 338.50 A: right 

341.85 342.83 B: (( ah )) 

343.57 346.78 B: ah [mn] you know a home base i they're 

346.59 347.35 A: oh 

347.12 351.70 B: [mn] fanatical religious views i think is is more of of of 

351.71 366.52 A: some of the countries that that are the reason why they're a threat is 'cause they support terrorism they're using um as a as a base to launch the terrorism as a as a haven for terrorism [noise] and to hide funds 

351.82 352.54 B: (( a )) 

366.47 374.08 B: [mn] right but the the country itself i don't i don't think i don't necessarily see that as the threat the threat is the people who are actually doing you know who are actually 

370.62 371.65 A: no 

373.39 374.54 A: right 

373.97 387.45 B: doing the training and and doing all of the money laundering [mn] so i yeah and and and and the the real problem is that i mean if it were a country then you could do something about it whereas if it's individuals i th- i i mean 

377.46 378.10 A: (( right )) 

383.75 384.63 A: mhm 

387.54 399.88 B: [mn] much like the mess that's going on over in israel you know i mean it's it's fanatical individuals going back and forth creating all this havoc and you know i mean you watch stuff on television and and i saw that thing about how some news 

390.20 391.20 A: mhm 

392.51 394.11 A: (( right mm )) 

400.14 405.93 B: ah program had gone over and they had bought this low grade ah uranium 

405.29 406.77 A: right right 

405.98 410.11 B: did you see that one and how they they they put it on the cargo ship 

407.21 408.23 A: yeah 

409.69 410.84 A: right 

410.20 419.51 B: yeah and then they they they showed a a video of it a you know travelling in the container on a on a semi ah going into new york city i mean that's 

419.57 421.95 B: you know that's where my fear is 

421.38 422.46 A: right 

422.20 426.49 B: and that's you know that's not that's not necessarily a country that's a group of people with 

426.80 430.46 B: you know some obviously pretty strong beliefs 

427.89 431.67 A: right i've right right the united states 

431.71 432.88 A: um 

432.92 442.79 A: in in its in its wisdom oh really aggravated foreign countries or ag- aggravated people by their by the united states' actions 

442.76 453.85 B: ah yeah i think so and i think that's a pretty unpopular view i i've i i'm i think that we pretty much ah have asked for everything that we've gotten it's it's a shame that 

451.67 452.88 A: right 

453.79 454.95 A: i mean um 

454.58 464.87 B: so many people who basically just want to have lives and and loves and and you know end up paying for it but i mean we really are pretty arrogant people folks 

464.86 477.49 A: right but you know like i say i'm like there aren't really any countries i mean there might be a few a few countries that might be um a threat you know i mean china you 

477.51 488.64 A: know is really used to be a real big problem but then they aren't that much of a of a problem um and then cuba's not that much of a problem there's a couple basic- basically it's 

488.61 492.37 A: in the mid eastern in middle eastern countries you know some of 'em 

492.30 500.87 A: some of them support um terrorism ah ah libya's been very quiet haven't heard anything from ah qaddafi 

500.79 508.15 A: on that and there used to be they really used to support terrorism a lot but they're very the irish have been very 

508.17 517.35 A: um used to be very noisy and vocal but they've they they're like sneaky you know what i mean they've been very sneaky and um 

518.19 524.27 A: ah ve- very like cautious and laid back and very quiet about it but 

523.66 526.95 B: i i think it's really hard ah 

527.47 528.98 A: to blame a country 

528.91 543.50 B: [mn] y- yeah i do because i think it's hard enough for myself at any rate to to understand on an individual level i i i mean how many causes in this world in your life are you are you ready to to to give your life up for you personally 

542.13 543.06 A: mhm 

543.69 545.35 A: yeah well i 

544.44 546.59 B: may- maybe your family right 

545.98 548.62 A: right right right mm 

546.84 551.77 B: well you know i think that's that's pretty much part just being a part of the species but 

552.51 563.39 B: i think it's a whole way of thinking that is so foreign to certainly to myself and to most of the people that i know i i i don't know how 

563.47 570.93 B: i i think we need to to have a a better understanding of the people themselves because i think this is a whole thing that we're missing here 

570.35 571.45 A: (( right and )) 

571.80 572.79 A: and 

571.89 575.92 B: i just don't i just don't understand someone willing to give their life 

575.95 578.41 B: for ah for a belief 

578.34 580.47 A: well they 

580.48 585.12 B: i mean i guess the military does it all the time i mean you can you can join the the army but 

583.12 586.72 A: right well i feel if the people 

585.58 587.10 B: somehow that's different 

586.55 599.91 A: and the countries the leaders um support the terrorists um or by terrorists i mean um and they sympathize with them so therefore they give them sanctions and stuff like that
