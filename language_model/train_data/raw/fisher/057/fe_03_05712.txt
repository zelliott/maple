323.27 325.10 B: then on the other hand 

325.29 329.60 B: [mn] they have the ability to seal themselves from the so-called [sigh] 

330.36 338.53 B: islamic laws [mn] but then they don't have to worry about retribution but they e- essentially have a capitalist country within 

338.72 340.55 B: confined [sigh] to their borders 

343.44 346.72 B: [noise] this gives them the ability to do [sigh] all sorts of things 

348.16 354.33 B: lending money which is against um [noise] the ah [sigh] islamic laws 

354.45 361.84 B: and and they can lend money to get a profit which is something apparently is against ah what mohammed 

361.95 363.05 B: teaches 

363.72 364.81 B: um 

365.79 369.39 B: [noise] also we have the russian republic [noise]

381.01 383.03 B: [noise] war torn machines 

384.83 387.09 B: [noise] that are angry at capital angry at ah 

388.47 391.35 B: [noise] capitalism but um 

391.52 393.22 B: [sigh] that's all they know

412.76 413.66 B: (( i think [noise] )) 

414.36 419.91 B: they are a b- big threat the arab and not the arab emirate countries [sigh] but russian republics [mn] 

419.93 421.45 B: (( because [sigh] because ))

429.35 430.86 B: very careful in those 

431.30 432.81 B: instances 

433.15 435.72 B: [sigh] other countries [noise] that might be a threat [noise] 

436.00 441.21 B: to the united states well we have the country of haiti

458.92 460.22 B: [noise] and um

463.80 465.86 B: (( supportive of these regimes that ah [mn] )) 

467.72 472.46 B: helped m- maintain their strength throughout the years so 

473.09 479.88 B: if the united states is attacked [noise] the attackers may have the ability to ah 

480.47 483.98 B: go to these countries mozambique south africa 

484.83 490.26 B: [noise] and ah get f- for safety and no one will know and because of the terrain 

490.58 497.57 B: [noise] lack of development ah development no one will know [noise] also let's not forget ah ah indonesian countries [noise] 

498.81 499.81 B: (( which ah )) 

500.52 507.15 B: have a lot of fundamentalists and will definitely [sigh] accept and allow a lot of aberrant behavior 

508.63 511.88 B: and you know we provide [noise] aid to these countries 

513.66 518.64 B: (( [noise] and the largest suppliers of aid as well as liberia )) 

518.75 524.98 B: because in liberia there's strong links to the united states [noise] and in many ways it's considered [noise] anti 

525.24 526.94 B: (( themselves anti )) 

527.45 528.64 B: so um 

529.27 531.43 B: because of that

541.81 542.98 B: for all we know 

543.99 551.78 B: [noise] they provide safe haven [noise] for persons like osama bin laden [noise] so with that being the case 

552.63 556.92 B: [noise] we're not really sure what we should be doing 

559.80 560.90 B: (( [noise] so um )) 

563.73 567.43 B: [noise] we have to look at [sigh] countries like japan also [noise]

585.12 586.81 B: [noise] attacks the united states 

586.85 594.39 B: i mean if their economy gets off the ground [sigh] then they they're definitely going to [sigh] reassess the situation and not allow
