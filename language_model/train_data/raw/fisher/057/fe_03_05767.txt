138.57 139.65 B: right 

145.35 154.47 A: i went i attended a seminar about a company i knew about called prepaid legal i don't know if you'd know that it's a it's a service where you you pay a a like 

153.35 156.37 B: yeah it's it's like you've got a lawyer on retainer 

155.62 166.09 A: that's right okay so anyway i had known about it but i knew of some negative things ab- negative things about it too but fran torkington is the ex- ah football player

165.43 167.46 B: yeah i know he was a giant 

166.23 173.91 A: who's now also big into pro- promotion and marketing especially with ah small business type of of things 

173.79 186.67 A: i was interested because i knew he was involved with that company so i i listened to this presentation but i said to them look i i i i'm tell you firm i'm not going to be joining you right now i'm going to go and look up ah 

186.53 199.59 A: your your ah your your company and i want to see what's being offered ah via fran torkington what he's doing because it's it's a multilevel marketing but anyway i went to an internet cafe on in times square forty second street 

193.85 195.48 B: (( yeah )) 

199.24 199.94 B: (( okay )) 

199.57 212.02 A: and i made the the the wise decision of going to google you know a search engine and i didn't type in prepaid legal dot com i just typed in prepaid legal and up came 

205.49 206.86 B: right 

212.48 217.95 A: prepa- beside prepaid legal dot com prepaid legal stocks dot com 

217.34 219.27 B: (( really )) 

217.99 221.41 A: and that took me to a whole bunch of other sites 

221.24 226.18 A: that took me to sites about internet marketing and i said oh my god 

225.50 226.42 B: (( [noise] )) 

226.07 240.09 A: i stood there in in in in in total disbelief what i had been missing all this time and it literally changed my n- my life barry i'll i'll tell you and i made a decision i i'm going to make an internet business 

239.88 248.64 A: i will not work for anybody else again and ah i started to learn about internet marketing and and and how 

248.56 256.17 A: just the internet in general and also selling and and and auctions whether it's via ebay or or 

256.37 265.83 A: any other auction site including half dot com and and even amazon you could sell if you have books in your house you could if you have books in your house you can go to ebay i mean not ebay 

265.61 267.94 A: half dot com or or amazon 

267.72 273.20 A: and you could list them for free and you only pay if you sell them you only pay a commission if you sell them 

271.25 273.66 B: yeah mhm 

273.00 288.00 A: so um i've learned that the internet is an incredible credible educational tool absolutely it could be misused too and and and it has been misused where students ah literally pagil- plagiarize ah 

286.91 290.79 B: [noise] right plagiarize stuff and share term papers and all that [noise] 

288.46 289.59 A: um 

289.55 291.12 A: term papers and what not 

290.94 298.64 A: but now there there are programs out there that fight back against that and actually will a teacher can submit 

298.47 307.50 A: they can i guess scan the ah term paper submitted and they'll fin- with the software and find out if this was indeed a plagiarized or not 

306.98 321.34 B: right i didn't know that see i'm i'm still again i'm i'm very much a i'm very much not a virgin but i'm pretty close to a virgin with com- the world of computers i mean i can email and i can i can you know type a letter with microsoft word and do a couple of little 

308.17 309.63 A: yeah that's 

321.33 326.24 B: ah cut and pastes and but i'm i'm my computer skills are still very small 

325.59 331.66 A: right when you're when you're talking about using that kind of software the i would consider that like offline 

331.42 332.81 B: right 

331.43 345.68 A: but i'm talking about online where there's that whole world out there where you could liter- i i as a matter of fact today i came across a a site that was created by a reporter and he has created this [mn] 

333.18 334.25 B: right 

346.15 356.94 A: this website where you can find out almost anything about any subject he has all the resources there including you you wanna find out something about somebody 

356.65 357.71 B: right 

356.96 364.58 A: and ah even one of the ah things was like ah joe blow who is he and how to find out an- an- anything about joe blow 

364.49 375.47 A: and he he leads you to different sites where some of them are free information some of them you pay five dollars or fifteen dollars and you can find out everything about joe blow 

370.14 371.71 B: right 

375.45 381.94 A: that you may want to find out that that possibly could be found out about him but also he has all these 

379.84 381.56 B: right 

381.96 393.67 A: resources for ah reporters that can find out anything about any subject that's that's possible 'cause ah even like s- s- a a a major search engine like google 

384.43 386.17 B: mhm 

386.96 388.08 B: (( hm )) 

393.64 395.30 A: is only 

395.15 399.93 A: a shallow part of the web there's another part of the web called the deep web 

399.72 411.11 A: where if you have the the knowledge and the tools and the access you can really go very very deep and find out all kinds of things that is beyond belief 

410.90 412.34 B: (( well are they true )) 

411.97 418.23 A: oh yeah i i'm not talking about um hype and stuff i'm i'm i'm talking about just researching 

418.51 425.65 A: researching the information um that it's all out there but imagine imagine if we had to 

425.86 427.62 A: open up let's say um 

427.51 434.08 A: ah well even if it's a dictionary or an encyclopedia on the net you can have an 

434.07 447.71 A: actual moving encyclopedia so you could let's say you're looking at dinosaurs you could actually see how they can grow from from an egg to a full dinosaur and then maybe how they move and what not in animation 

445.84 452.38 B: [noise] right no i understand that i mean that that that's certainly a dimension that you're not going to get in a book 

447.77 450.48 A: (( yeah )) 

451.85 453.50 A: exactly so 

454.03 457.37 A: the question was asked can we 

457.61 460.86 A: was it the internet i guess they said internet or computers 

459.64 463.08 B: computers i think it was just computers and education 

461.05 468.90 A: yeah computers well you need computers to access the ah the web of course ah internet of course um so um 

465.07 466.80 B: right 

469.28 472.29 A: that ah actually i think creates [cough] 

472.19 474.42 A: as a matter of fact how about this 

474.23 486.43 A: you you want to be operated on but you're in an overseas country and they can actually webcam you to a doctor in the states who's an expert in whatever they have the procedure that they're using on you 

486.23 495.92 A: and he's guiding them maybe not even guiding them but guiding a robot that to do the microsurgery that you need this actually 

493.52 496.68 B: i know that's hard to believe but i know it happens 

496.02 500.45 A: yeah it it's it's it's not fairy tale this is really really happening too 

501.06 509.84 A: so computers as an educational tool me i say absolutely it's a a great enhancement what would be the negative of that ah fact 

510.10 514.43 A: unless you're talking about ah plagiarism and and 

512.23 517.92 B: you know i think that's part of the negative and i think you know that some of the personal hands on although 

517.73 527.37 B: you know it's certainly with interactive and i i mean it's it's almost the same as sitting in a classroom and certainly a lot of people are getting a formal education without leaving their homes 

526.85 541.72 A: right well you know look look at the supermarket it's five for a dollar right and they have these scanners and and and the computers tell you the change and all that so you know when you i worked in the supermarket a and p when i was a ch- a kid seventeen 

535.51 536.56 B: right 

540.82 541.60 B: mhm 

541.83 554.34 A: and ah you had to do everything you know by your mind right so if it was five for a dollar and you only bought three you know it's sixty cents right now it says five for a dollar and you only bought one they say manager manager 

544.58 545.43 B: right 

549.18 550.27 B: right 

554.12 561.93 A: (( how much is this [laughter] and the manager doesn't even know [laughter] right )) 

555.64 556.65 B: i know 

557.91 564.47 B: no i know and that is a downside i mean you know i mean that happened even before the computers were were scanning 

564.26 573.33 B: and doing it just when you know people are cashiers were just putting the amount tentative and some change was magically appearing instead of adding and subtracting 

571.86 578.37 A: right but that was ah i guess a a form of computer doing that work for them you know like a calculator 

575.09 579.19 B: yeah i guess so yeah no i guess you're right right 

578.20 588.54 A: but all of a sudden they didn't have to think even now some kids cannot apparently they cannot read a ah i guess an analogue clock you know that shows one two three four five six seven 

587.59 589.96 B: (( right they only read digitals )) 

588.55 593.45 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

590.60 595.03 B: that's hard that i mean see those are some of the downsides of technology i agree with you 

593.84 599.89 A: right but does that mean that um it's not useful i don't think so i do think you have to 

598.30 599.95 B: no but i think it
