0.26 1.61 A: hello 

1.12 2.27 B: (( hi there )) 

2.07 8.80 A: hi what's the uh my name is brian from uh i'm currently living in uh northern california around u._c. berkeley you 

8.81 11.54 B: (( right uh my name is uh adam and i'm up in seattle )) 

11.49 12.86 A: seattle okay 

12.44 14.66 B: just north of you [laughter] 

13.67 23.32 A: y- yeah that's definitely true you're up near uh redmond and all those people and the c._s. students so i'm a little familiar with that so okay i hm 

17.23 19.50 B: exactly yeah okay 

19.86 20.88 B: (( right now i )) 

21.17 25.69 B: i i work in expedia so i so you're probably familiar with uh with what we do 

25.44 29.59 A: oh yes well what uh what development end or just just 

28.08 36.74 B: um i'm actually a program manager so i work with yeah alongside the work developers and the testers and everybody else so yeah i don't i don't actually do the development myself 

36.49 40.22 A: very cool okay so let's see as for the question um 

37.40 38.16 B: (( yeah )) 

40.38 50.94 A: ah well i'd have to say probably i'd go go with my friends for the most part 'cause i've personally i've i've never been one for just straight monetary r- uh rewards one way or another you know while 

44.68 45.43 B: uh-huh 

49.36 50.91 B: yeah yeah [mn] 

50.86 58.67 A: while personally to me you know it's not a bad thing and it would be nice to have money at the same time it's not yeah i'd i'd i'd i'd i find you know 

58.71 64.45 A: concepts and stuff more interesting so hanging around people and talking is it would probably be better for me personally you 

64.20 67.24 B: yeah yeah i fully agree with uh um 

67.15 73.69 B: i mean if i- if a anonymous benefactor were to give me a million dollars with no strings attached i would take it in 

73.52 88.17 B: a heartbeat um and i i think just about any situation that i could think of where a million dollars came my way uh i would definitely consider it but it with the stipulation that i wouldn't that uh see my friends ever again or or speak with them ever again that'd be 

88.20 93.36 B: i think that would uh i think that my friends are worth more than a million dollars i guess [laughter] 

92.45 93.34 A: yeah 

93.63 94.59 A: let's see 

93.77 94.87 B: (( yeah if there was some w- )) 

94.78 95.60 A: (( hm )) 

94.91 101.41 B: if there was some way to cheat it a- and uh and somehow get 'em both in yeah i'd be stoked [laughter] 

96.76 97.84 A: [laughter] 

100.36 106.59 A: ah yes the uh the trap there's some classical story which [sigh] uh uh i've i've 

104.94 106.10 B: (( [laughter] yeah [mn] )) 

106.65 118.80 A: i'm just thinking about it it's like okay yeah for for me it's sort of weird for me though 'cause i have like you know like i said i'm going i'm going to u._c. berkeley so i got a you know i came from southern california so i'm my friends are like split into two different areas at the moment so 

117.90 118.64 B: uh-huh 

118.85 122.77 A: sort of p- perpendicular comment but hey it's it's sort of weird 

122.60 123.70 B: yeah yeah 

123.52 124.56 A: um 

123.92 125.23 B: (( yeah if uh )) 

125.40 133.76 B: if uh you know if the if the exchange was for the million dollars i couldn't live in washington state ever again or if i couldn't live in the united states ever again 

133.62 142.52 B: or it was you know i'd have to lose three of my toes or something [laughter] you know there's definitely things that i would be happy to exchange for a million dollars but uh 

142.60 149.24 B: (( you know i don't know i think i i think i like my friends a lot [laughter] wouldn't wouldn't want to do that )) 

145.73 147.10 A: (( [laughter] yeah it )) 

148.57 157.57 A: it it's it would be sort of a a a hard situation just try it and let's see and try and think of the best way to put this into any sort of words [laughter] um 

156.88 157.83 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

157.75 158.68 A: it's 

159.66 167.69 A: my my friends are sort of unique in their own way you know i i i see lots of groups of other people and they seem to sort of have a standard way of going about things but my friends are generally sort of 

162.24 162.98 B: (( mhm )) 

167.71 173.21 A: the exact perpendicular set of people if that makes any sense it it's it's just huh 

170.40 172.52 B: yeah exactly abs- 

173.18 174.83 B: absolutely absolutely 

174.76 176.40 A: it yeah it's 

176.45 182.60 A: (( they it it it it's sort of you'd have to come up with a whole new i don't know what the best way to put it is [laughter] )) 

180.34 181.82 B: yeah yeah 

181.88 187.87 B: i mean i mean for example like ah you know the the kinds of of things that that my friends and i do you know we uh 

188.06 196.01 B: for for spring break at the our last year in college we um well one of our friends was given a an o- old limousine and so uh 

195.31 196.01 A: (( mm y- )) 

195.88 205.22 B: there was six or seven of us piled in the limousine wearing leisure suits and fake mustaches and whatnot and uh we had this road trip from seattle down to california where we uh 

205.01 217.49 B: you know just just shaking it up the whole time you know just being clowns and being crazy and stuff and you know it's just uh there's not so many people in the world that can hang with that [laughter] you know and wanna go and just and be a fool in some strange city you know 

217.26 224.19 B: but uh but that's exactly the kind of thing that i like and [laughter] and that's you know why i can't g- you know give these people up [laughter] 

222.90 231.32 A: [laughter] that's pretty cool ah my my friends are sort of i i guess sort of the opposite but sort of not they they're sort of hard it it's one of those things that's hard to say it's 

224.31 225.41 B: yeah 

231.15 231.78 B: (( uh-huh )) 

231.34 243.97 A: they they're just str- they're mentally strange uh with my my my friends are tend to be you know because i'm a programmer i tend to have you know friends who are s- one way or another techni- techno- uh technically savvy or at least interested in some weird topics like 

234.87 236.04 B: (( sure yeah [laughter] )) 

241.95 242.71 B: uh-huh 

243.88 250.78 A: you know my friend is a- or like a a a you know arche- archeology major and you know stuff like that and just all of them 

247.55 248.44 B: oh cool 

249.28 250.02 B: uh-huh 

250.83 256.12 A: have some sort of disconnect with reality to a degree but it's it's sort of in in an entertaining way you know [laughter] 

253.32 254.25 B: [laughter] 

255.22 257.03 B: (( yeah absolutely uh-huh )) 

256.52 268.48 A: it it's uh i mean we we don't necessarily do anything that outrageous but at the same time you know like you know conversations get awfully weird and stuff like that tracing into odd parts of uh [laughter] i don't know what the best w- i don't what the best way to put this is 

268.44 279.38 B: yeah but yeah when you when you get when you get a group of people that um that just create a good energy with something unique like that you know where it's like you know i'd i you know a lot of my coworkers for example you know i i 

268.49 269.16 A: (( [laughter] )) 

279.24 290.54 B: you know they they come to find out about stories like the limousine story and other things like that and and [laughter] you know they the love to hear the stories but they could never do that you know [laughter] and uh 

289.41 290.76 A: (( right [laughter] )) 

290.32 301.57 B: you know and they you know like you my my idea of vacation over over winter i i ran off uh on my own to uh to south east asia to like cambodia and vietnam and stuff and you know was just running around in crazy 

301.43 301.88 B: (( you know )) 

301.89 303.30 B: dangerous places and stuff 

303.30 304.50 B: and yeah i come back and 

304.51 309.36 B: my friends are yeah they totally understand and yeah they wanna go and do the same thing when they get vacation time and 

309.36 320.72 B: you know and then my coworkers are like wow you know we went to disneyland y- you know and it's like [laughter] you know the the it's just it's a really special thing when you can find a group of people that that yeah that have that unique 

313.59 314.77 A: [laughter] 

320.50 325.11 B: thing that that makes you you that uh that that you have in common with them you know but that's 

324.37 325.58 A: right 

325.73 327.06 A: (( [sigh] that's )) 

326.18 328.21 B: a valuable thing [laughter] 

327.43 333.38 A: mhm i'm i'm just trying to think of anything any other part of this topic which is interesting sorry is it uh 

333.77 335.33 A: (( uh we [sigh] )) 

335.25 339.75 B: well so uh what what things would you uh be willing to exchange for a million dollars 

339.45 341.12 A: well i mean 

341.21 344.12 A: [laughter] um probably a whole bunch of things but at the same 

343.92 356.69 A: i don't know i'm again like i said i'm not particularly interested in that much money if it was something basically i wouldn't really be ha- i don't know if i'd really be happy with found money i'd prefer to have money for something that i did to a degree you know why you you know i'm that it it's s- it probably sounds sort of weird but 

352.53 353.62 B: true yeah 

356.71 366.42 A: uh i don't know it's it's like not that i wouldn't i wouldn't accept it but it's not like it's [mn] it's hard for me to describe this kind of a the the the way i'm thinking 

357.44 358.07 B: (( uh-huh )) 

366.26 367.06 B: uh-huh 

366.86 379.27 A: yeah i i i well let me put it this way i have like lots of random ideas that they you know as a a programmer and i'm like thinking i like being like i i'm hoping to sometime be someday possibly be like a game programmer is something like that in the entertainment business 

372.19 372.92 B: uh-huh 

379.23 388.21 A: uh but at the same time it's sort of like i if i wanted if i got money i- if i got some sort of basically i just really want is apprecia- appreciation as opposed to like money in a lot of cases 

387.91 389.49 B: (( uh-huh yeah absolutely )) 

388.41 389.11 A: w- 

389.12 391.24 A: which makes it i hope it makes some sense 

391.21 392.00 B: yeah 

391.25 392.13 A: (( i mean )) 

392.57 395.09 A: with money hm 

392.62 399.67 B: but i think you know w- w- when i think about yeah getting a big pile of money like that you know i think that that 

400.58 404.92 B: that the the best thing to do with that kind of thing is to go and and 

404.77 417.80 B: use that as a tool to to help further your goal of appreciation i mean if you had a million dollars you could start yourself a pretty damn good uh you know video game company and so um and so you know h- hopefully you'd be able to find a constructive use for it 

417.77 420.66 B: that would help satisfy that um 

420.68 421.62 B: uh 

421.67 429.95 B: the rewarding feeling um even though with found money you know but that hopefully you could get that reward and and make something with it or something like that 

425.18 426.02 A: yeah 

428.94 431.75 A: this is true this is true good point uh 

430.25 431.23 B: (( yeah )) 

431.88 439.44 A: let's see yeah it's uh and that is that that is interesting uh let's see but otherwise [sigh] i mean 

439.76 445.20 A: i i don't know i've never really thought that just really never thought about getting that much money before [laughter] 

444.52 448.97 B: yeah [laughter] that's true [laughter] 

448.09 449.80 A: uh let's see 

450.48 452.37 A: well let me just just r- uh 

452.49 462.19 A: [sigh] i don't know what i w- what i would give up for a million dollars i sort of like my life as it is if you know i mean you know i i i i like my extremities and stuff like that i [laughter] ah [mn] 

456.35 458.37 B: uh-huh yeah 

459.85 472.73 B: [laughter] but you know if if someone just said uh we we really need a pinkie finger really bad you know like yeah we'll we'll give a million bucks for it if you wouldn't mind sparing it like you think you could give it up [laughter] 

469.29 470.68 A: (( i don't )) 

471.95 478.84 A: know [mn] you know it is useful in picking stuff up and you know stuff like that you know i'd have to learn to do without it and 

476.80 478.23 B: [laughter] 

478.80 480.29 B: [laughter] 

478.89 484.04 A: yeah it's sort of a long term thing you know uh [laughter] 

481.47 484.90 B: yeah yeah y- you don't get another one yeah [laughter] 

484.19 492.43 A: um uh so [mn] it's hard to say to be honest ah i i guess see this is the kind of thing it's really hard to do unless you actually get put in that situation 

487.70 488.83 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

492.16 493.26 B: right right 

492.60 506.84 A: well but which is of course highly unlikely [laughter] uh it's just i mean it's i don't know it's i i i think i have a weird value system when it comes to like money and stuff like that but that's just me [laughter] 

495.32 497.50 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] of course [laughter] uh-huh )) 

505.61 512.14 B: sure [laughter] yeah yeah i don't know yeah i think for a pinkie finger i could do that if it were 

512.60 514.35 B: i'm not sure what would i 

514.62 516.51 B: (( give up you know )) 

516.57 522.56 B: i think it i think there would be things that i that i just think of that that i could definitely do without like for me y- you know 

522.43 531.91 B: well you said yeah well it's handy for picking things up but it's like yeah but you know when i think about it i probably use my other fingers more often than my pinkie so i could do without that one so yeah 

531.21 538.92 A: [mn] [laughter] but how are we gonna type the a and the a and z keys and stuff like that and semi colon dang it semi colon [laughter] 

536.10 537.23 B: yeah 

537.98 541.85 B: (( [laughter] and the shift button you know come on [laughter] this finger )) 

540.69 543.15 A: (( [laughter] you you )) 

543.00 544.28 B: isn't for nothing 

543.93 552.33 A: [laughter] i know it's a- again as as a coder i guess i have a different view of that kind of thing [laughter] yeah so it all works out 

549.92 552.06 B: (( yeah yeah [laughter] )) 

552.10 556.46 B: yeah that's cool [laughter] so so how did you hear about this experiment uh-huh 

555.86 563.53 A: um i th- ah was it through i i'm doing actually actually doing research at u._c. berkeley so i think i heard thr- through one of the 

563.40 572.46 A: uh i- indirectly through like one of the professors i'm working with you know just that it it's one of those random things that they heard of and i heard of you know that that they told us 

567.11 567.87 B: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

571.72 572.95 B: (( yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah )) 

572.54 578.75 A: it all worked out uh just trying to remember it i don't remember any more but ah it works it it's sort of cool 

578.44 580.52 B: yeah totally have you done any other calls 

580.46 586.32 A: huh yeah there was one there was one on a the the the pets thing which was sort of an interesting one but 

581.15 582.45 B: have you done any other calls 

585.80 587.04 B: oh it was what 

586.83 593.43 A: uh uh uh on pets you know about like do you have you know do you have pets you know what you know basically just the standard you know talk about your pets 

593.34 596.82 B: okay got you [laughter] that's funny [laughter] 

595.38 596.30 A: um 

596.34 599.95 A: the the the the only thing i remember is that's it's awfully abrupt ending
