14.06 15.00 B: so 

15.63 18.87 B: what do you think about uh the topic 

17.26 18.20 A: well 

18.27 23.29 A: it depends on what you think some states have better public schools than others where are you from 

22.71 24.58 B: i'm in georgia 

24.29 29.47 A: oh okay i'm in georgia also [laughter]

30.30 31.64 A: yeah 

31.62 32.87 B: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

33.58 36.20 B: see i don't know much about the other 

36.31 39.91 B: like any other public schools i just know about mine 

39.97 41.51 B: and just 

41.10 45.42 A: what are you from you're in high school in georgia well i go to tech georgia tech 

45.25 46.33 B: yeah 

45.73 49.04 A: and i'm originally from arkansas i went to high school there 

48.83 49.89 B: yeah 

49.30 50.28 A: i mean 

50.84 56.99 A: it's not like the school i went to it was fun 'cause basically a lot of the uh 

57.37 64.36 A: politicians and i guess yeah politicians and stuff like that went to our high schools so basically our high school got a lotta funding and stuff 

64.00 65.10 B: yeah 

64.48 77.88 A: but some of the other some of the other high schools and middle schools didn't get the best and i don't know i mean i guess based on all of who you know and what kids go to what school i mean it's kinda messed up they disliked it 

77.25 79.03 B: yeah 

78.13 80.92 A: and then especially in like the rural areas 

81.08 84.52 B: yeah see i'm an hour north of you in gainesville 

83.92 84.95 A: okay 

84.62 88.66 B: and uh it's like i go to the city school 

88.07 88.98 A: uh-huh 

88.79 89.82 B: where 

89.88 97.61 B: almost everybody that goes or at least all the white people their moms and dads are lawyers and doctors 

97.01 98.37 A: oh okay 

97.96 102.01 B: and then it's like that and then there's 

103.17 104.91 B: all that and 

105.37 111.38 B: so like we have a very nice school because of all the money coming in from the lawyers and doctors 

110.31 112.01 A: right right 

111.46 120.57 B: but then like like it's a lot nicer than the school that's fifteen minutes out where they have five times as many people 

117.54 118.49 A: uh-huh 

120.23 124.02 A: i know what you're saying and not near as many teachers anything like that 

120.99 122.12 B: but 

123.29 124.83 B: yeah it's like 

125.04 125.98 B: (( you know )) 

126.05 128.63 B: all farming community 

128.24 129.45 A: (( mhm )) 

128.83 129.69 B: (( so )) 

131.19 132.21 B: (( [lipsmack] i )) 

132.16 142.10 A: but i don't know how to really make the situation right because then people they will always say well the parents donated this much money to the school and 

132.24 133.02 B: (( don't )) 

142.46 143.56 B: (( know yeah )) 

142.95 152.60 A: i mean it i guess it would be easier if the if the donations went to like the district you know what i'm saying or the county or what not and then i guess you could organize it a little better 

148.15 149.45 B: yeah 

153.59 159.83 B: [lipsmack] see like and my mom's a teacher so i see some of that stuff 

157.11 157.95 A: uh-huh 

159.21 161.68 A: yeah my mom used to be a teacher too right 

160.84 163.65 B: yeah but 

163.68 165.45 B: like i don't know how you 

165.48 175.88 B: how you can improve it 'cause i i also haven't seen a whole lot of other situations i've just seen mine and the people next to me 

171.81 172.91 A: yeah 

175.26 176.58 A: (( i know what you're saying )) 

176.48 179.39 B: so [noise] i mean it's just 

180.11 181.79 B: (( i don't know there's )) 

182.14 188.06 A: [mn] what got me about was like when you see my middle the middle school that i went to it was okay you know 

186.44 187.40 B: mhm 

187.71 188.67 B: yeah 

187.99 197.62 A: but then the middle school that my mom taught at it was i mean it was a city school but it was like more in like the uh a lower socioeconomic status 

190.39 191.43 B: yeah 

197.39 198.29 B: yeah 

197.67 207.28 A: you know what i'm saying and i mean the school wasn't really r- run down but the the teachers really didn't get paid that much i mean they w- they wanted to teach you know but they can't 

207.67 209.19 A: it was just kinda 

209.72 215.87 A: i don't know it seemed like the more and more i looked at schools the schools are based more on so- socioeconomic 

215.68 216.84 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

215.74 229.41 A: classed and i mean they say they don't do that when they zone 'em but i mean it's hard for me to believe that that's the case 'cause then you go to another middle school and it was you know new gyms new all this new all that 

222.55 223.51 B: yeah 

229.38 238.98 B: yeah i mean that's like kinda what i'm talking about 'cause in my school we just had like a multi million dollar gym put in 

238.60 239.67 A: oh for real 

239.25 247.47 B: yeah and we have like a theater that it's like it rivals like venues in atlanta 

246.88 248.02 A: oh for real 

247.65 256.16 B: yeah and just like all this nice stuff and then the school next to us is just like it's run down yeah 

253.86 267.85 A: falling apart i know what you're saying 'cause like my little sister she played basketball and we used to go up to some of these other cities in in arkansas and i mean these places have like brand new gyms i mean like the gy- like uh 

268.46 275.66 A: one of the gyms here at tech is almost looks exactly like the gym that was up there and this is a frigging high school man 

275.22 276.58 B: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

275.76 279.34 A: and i don't under- i don't understand how they can fund it 

279.54 280.97 A: but i don't know 

280.73 289.93 B: i don't understand where we got the money to build the gym 'cause i mean we just also had like a whole new school building built 

288.43 289.25 A: (( mhm )) 

289.99 291.08 B: and then 

291.59 296.57 B: it's it's like i really am wondering where all this money's coming from 

295.98 305.07 A: but then ya hear 'em always talking about oh the education budget is so small and we don't have enough money to go around and all of that other stuff but then they started building new 

302.95 303.86 B: yeah 

305.03 316.10 A: in certain areas they're building new schools and remodeling schools 'cause like my high school they just got a budget approved the high school i went to they got a budget approved to remodel basically the entire high school 

315.97 317.07 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

316.55 320.05 A: and i don't un- i'm trying to figure where this money is go- is coming from 

321.45 327.67 B: i don't know it's like i'm still just like we have now two gyms 

327.07 328.09 A: oh for real 

327.72 337.12 B: yeah and the new one we only use for basketball basketball games and assembly and like i think there's a health class back in there somewhere 

333.26 334.14 A: uh-huh 

336.68 337.80 A: oh okay 

337.37 341.97 B: most students haven't even been in it yet and it's been up for 

339.72 341.02 A: oh 

342.32 343.69 B: about a year 

343.42 349.23 A: so what do you i is your uh basketball does your high school have a pretty decent basketball team 

348.61 351.88 B: uh i think our girls won states 

351.47 352.45 A: (( oh okay oh )) 

352.26 353.21 B: (( so )) 

353.39 355.50 B: and our boys did well 

354.99 356.55 A: okay okay 

356.26 367.97 B: but i mean like 'cause i just don't understand the need [noise] for a lot of the stuff that we have and [noise] like we have 

368.59 373.14 B: like i'm in hall county it's split up into six different high schools 

372.54 373.42 A: uh-huh 

373.26 381.04 B: and a lot of seniors in their senior year they'll transfer from the other high schools to like my high school 

380.51 381.56 A: (( oh okay )) 

381.28 388.06 B: just because like if they're playing sports and we're supposed to be very academically 

382.95 383.81 A: they'll 

384.20 385.01 A: uh-huh 

387.50 388.34 A: uh-huh 

388.27 395.64 B: and it's like well why not fix up the other schools instead of making ours so much better 

395.12 397.25 A: yeah that sounds like my high school 

396.94 398.21 B: (( yeah yeah )) 

397.62 400.60 A: i i totally agree i mean 'cause 

401.04 412.69 A: if in high i mean it's good to have a nice high school and all of that hoopla but i mean what about the other kids i mean they wanna decent education they wanna have you know a nice a nice place to go to school and what not 

412.07 414.39 B: yeah i mean 

414.59 422.10 B: [lipsmack] like my mom's told me about schools that like she's sent to 'cause she's a speech pathologist 

421.52 422.39 A: uh-huh 

422.02 432.82 B: so she just travels around and like they almost had to quarantine classrooms because like the carpet in there was so old that uh like 

423.81 424.82 A: (( oh okay )) 

433.22 439.58 B: mold had yeah mold had formed and it was traveling in the air and making kids sick 

434.18 435.55 A: are you serious 

439.00 440.15 A: (( wow )) 

440.50 442.96 B: and i was like well why 

443.10 444.11 B: (( you know )) 

444.29 449.10 B: why can't they take care of that when they're they're building new gyms 

449.20 450.38 A: yeah 

449.78 455.38 B: and that was actually in the same school district that i'm in it was just like 

454.79 456.10 A: are you serious 

455.47 458.23 B: yeah it was like an elementary school 

457.64 459.04 A: (( wow no )) 

460.28 461.42 B: and 

462.46 465.98 B: [sigh] i mean i'm no good with finances but 

465.49 467.84 A: me either i couldn't budget 

467.38 468.80 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

468.19 480.02 A: i mean but who who out there is doing the budgeting anyway is it the school i mean the superintendents the you know who elec- are are superintendents elected by what the mayor and people like that 

474.38 475.19 B: (( i )) 

478.14 478.70 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

478.97 480.06 B: (( um )) 

480.08 482.88 B: i don't think the people elect the superintendent 

483.16 484.64 A: they're appointed 

484.26 485.69 B: (( yeah i don't know )) 

486.67 490.73 B: 'cause we had one and then we just got a new one 

489.95 491.55 A: (( hm oh okay )) 

491.63 493.57 B: and 

491.78 492.88 A: hm 

493.58 497.90 B: i don't know maybe they're promoted i've no idea 

499.22 500.99 B: but 

501.74 506.94 A: maybe if they were i don't know maybe if they were elected instead of actually you know appointed kinda like 

507.51 508.60 B: yeah 

508.02 520.51 A: kinda like everything else is 'cause i mean if the if the people and then like the people who should actually vote for the people who go to like be superintendents the people who actually have kids in school you know and not just people who are single or what not who don't have kids 

516.44 517.84 B: yeah 

520.60 527.00 A: you know what i'm saying 'cause the people who have kids in school would probably know the most about what their child's education is like 

520.65 521.56 B: yeah 

526.38 530.05 B: yeah have 'em vote at p. t. a. meeting or something 

528.64 539.31 A: exactly yes exactly p. t. a. meetings have like you know how like you have like a bunch of different districts for when you go vote for the president have like each district go and vote for the superintendent 

535.59 536.64 B: yeah 

538.68 540.51 B: (( yeah i mean )) 

540.52 542.54 B: that's what they should be doing 

542.00 543.74 A: yeah i agree 

544.10 548.37 B: and i don't know why are they not doing it already but 

546.61 547.92 A: (( i don't know )) 

549.23 550.30 B: (( i don't know )) 

550.70 553.43 B: like my mom's talked about some and just 

553.73 560.77 B: complained about it but you know her thing was always like i can't do anything about it 'cause they're my boss 

560.39 565.91 A: yeah i know what you're saying they're paying they're paying your check i know what you're saying that's that's how my mom is 

563.27 565.34 B: (( so yeah )) 

566.40 567.62 B: (( [lipsmack] so )) 

568.75 569.81 B: (( i don't know ))
