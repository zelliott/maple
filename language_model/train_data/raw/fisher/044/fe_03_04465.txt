9.42 10.73 B: mhm 

11.74 14.61 B: yes so what's your opinion about them 

12.89 14.02 A: okay 

14.77 18.47 A: uh about public schools i think um 

18.78 23.96 A: [lipsmack] there's just some there's a lot of inconsistencies with as far as uh 

24.51 28.00 A: um [laughter] we have 

28.46 37.63 A: a there's a lot of inconsistencies as far as l- like levels and uh uh you know due to funding and and you know demographics where you're at and and uh 

32.60 33.58 B: yeah 

35.76 45.18 B: yeah a lot of disparities on how children are taught and the quality of education and the facilities are very different depending on your area [laughter] 

43.66 47.55 A: yeah and i think it's really i think it's even hard for uh 

48.04 53.72 A: you know a lot of teachers to do their jobs just because of um [lipsmack] some of the stuff from you know 

53.75 62.86 A: upbringing in the home and and you know just r- respect and and safety for some of 'em i mean a lot of a lot of teachers are pulling out of public schools 'cause of the safety issues you know 

55.13 56.12 B: mhm 

62.50 71.62 B: mhm and they're very underpaid and under- well they certainly don't have a lot of materials to go around especially in the poorer areas so it must be 

70.62 74.01 A: yeah my sister's actually she started a charter school 

74.16 78.07 A: and uh at where she lives and they just got you know i guess 

78.46 85.18 A: the last three years she's been doing it she's she's doing art there now but i mean and she did some home schooling with my i mean 

85.08 98.90 A: for my nieces and nephews and i mean they were just she kinda mainstreamed them back out but early on she did some home schooling and you know i mean i mean the on the one side i mean they are super intelligent i mean they're she's really stayed on 'em one on one but 

98.91 100.01 A: um 

100.42 103.70 A: i don't know i have some i have mixed feelings about that 'cause 

103.22 105.87 B: well you don't get to develop social skills as much 

105.20 108.11 A: exactly yeah yeah 

107.61 116.94 B: [mn] but um well what do you think about um the the schools being put into the hands of charter groups and outside sources besides being state run do you think that's a good idea does it solve some of the problems in the mishandling 

117.47 118.71 A: um 

118.88 123.76 A: as far as you know you mean having the choice to go to i mean i know in phila- 

122.31 131.37 B: [noise] well no that um many many places have been putting uh uh the uh the administration in running the schools into private companies to take care of them 

131.73 135.47 B: um especially in philadelphia we've been having a great debate over that they just um 

135.53 138.64 B: put most of the schools in charge of outside uh 

138.23 140.08 A: are you are you in philadelphia now 

139.39 140.44 B: yes 

140.32 143.94 A: yeah i live i'm from philly but i've moved to los angeles now so 

143.22 144.59 B: mhm 

144.02 148.36 A: um but uh yeah i was thinking in philadelphia especially they had um 

148.52 154.14 A: but they were weren't they giving you a choice you had to have a voucher whether you could uh where you could go um 

153.19 162.47 B: yeah that was that was a huge debate for a long time i'm pretty sure they still have the vouchers for them to go to the catholic schools but um i don't think that that solves much of anything 

157.43 158.49 A: yeah 

162.73 173.59 A: what how how much of the uh i mean i would have to see the track record on it 'cause i mean how how long has it been uh been going as far as you 'cause it will be essentially school for profit right i mean 

163.01 163.81 B: (( so )) 

173.07 186.81 B: right right um from what what i i've seen they haven't it hasn't completely happened yet and there's still a lot of public debate um and it hasn't gone into full force into the hands of that that private contractor i guess i don't know the names 

187.05 193.81 B: uh the the gentleman that's in charge of most of it but th- there's certainly a lot of charter schools popping up in the area um 

192.83 194.04 A: mhm 

194.06 196.50 B: outside sources but um 

196.06 198.81 A: yeah i don't do you have do you have any kids at all or 

198.92 201.02 B: no not not yet no 

200.32 205.46 A: yeah i don't i don't either so i have i just can base it on you know people i've talked 

204.22 208.53 B: well like myself my ex- i mean i went through public school all twelve years 

208.36 210.23 A: to yeah mhm 

208.83 219.74 B: um and you know depending on where i lived it was either horrendous or great i mean i had much better experiences in smaller schools obviously and more affluent neighborhoods but um 

219.56 221.02 A: (( exactly [noise] )) 

219.81 223.03 B: they were all they were all pretty much um 

223.57 236.71 B: literally falling apart at the seams sharing textbooks i remember in high school sharing a biology textbook that was thirty years old with four other students and you couldn't bring it home to do homework and that was at a yeah that was at girls' high it was at a magnate school you know [laughter] 

232.20 233.49 A: really 

235.66 237.37 A: that was in girls' high 

236.67 238.62 B: yeah so um 

238.40 239.50 A: wow 

239.23 241.57 B: [lipsmack] it was amazing it was 

240.66 243.80 A: that's supposed to be one of the the better schools in philly i mean 

242.91 251.96 B: well it still lost quite a bit and it's been under attack for a very long time for dean violation of title nine because it's all women's school they don't uh outright refuse men 

252.01 253.23 B: entrance 

253.28 265.46 B: but um none have actually gone and you know central went co ed about ten years ago and the enrollment went down spectacularly and and so they to drop their um admission requirements which you know further 

265.49 267.09 B: um i guess 

267.37 274.10 B: eroded to the quality of the school because you know a lot of the people in there weren't as um academically minded as they had when 

274.11 277.76 B: uh they weren't competing with central for the women students [lipsmack] 

277.04 283.82 A: yeah i don't i mean i don't think it's such a bad thing i don't think it's a discrimination thing i mean i mean for some people um 

281.52 292.44 B: [lipsmack] yeah it's well there's so many studies that prove that women do much better in same sex environments because of all the different psychological and sociological effects of being in a male dominated environment 

292.40 293.45 A: yeah 

292.87 296.43 B: i mean well the argument is you're going to go into that world anyway but 

296.39 298.31 A: mhm 

296.56 305.88 B: um i i think that well it took me until i was outside of it to realize how uh distinct that effect was and how much more of a relaxed supportive environment it was 

305.95 315.72 B: so when i went into a co ed school then you know you started to see the fact that none of the women spoke in class and i was the only one and when i did speak out i was accused of being overly aggressive and 

305.99 306.98 A: yeah 

315.74 321.89 B: you know other nasty words [laughter] for outspoken women and i had no idea i was outspoken so [lipsmack] 

321.40 325.38 A: well well what about cen- what about central being all all male you know 

325.07 328.17 B: oh it's not all male anymore not for the last ten years so 

327.22 330.75 A: well that's what i mean i mean it was the same it's the same kinda thing 

330.39 338.12 B: yeah i've never really ex- you know been in the classroom been around the classroom from what i've heard from other people it's a very very good school 

338.28 339.71 A: yeah yeah 

338.83 341.11 B: it has a lot of drugs problems but you 

340.75 342.47 A: oh really mm 

341.16 349.43 B: know yeah well you know they're in that area and just 'cause they're smart doesn't mean they're not going to go out and get themselves into [laughter] 

344.48 346.02 A: okay yeah 

348.46 350.50 A: yeah i hear ya i hear ya 

349.75 350.71 B: (( mm )) 

350.91 353.21 A: so um [noise] yeah but i 

351.96 354.18 B: did you go the philadelphia public schools 

354.05 363.57 A: uh i didn't i didn't go to public schools in philly i i went actually in new jersey actually southern new jersey but uh i came to philly when i was in college 

358.90 359.53 B: (( [mn] )) 

361.85 366.63 B: their schools have been doing v- very well over the last five years or so right the new jersey school system 

366.73 370.55 A: yeah well there's some that i mean like washington township was like a big 

370.50 383.20 A: school thing going there and oh i think um and in fact i've gone out and played at some schools 'cause i i do this kind of a uh a music clinic for latin music with uh with a lot of just different public schools so 

380.64 381.51 B: wow 

382.48 383.71 B: mhm 

383.14 392.29 A: i've gotten to see like a a variety of different schools from uh some of the quaker schools which are very good i mean i mean i mean 

389.94 393.54 B: yes if i have children they're going to quaker school [laughter] 

393.30 400.71 A: i mean i mean right down to like just the respect for if you have a a musical group coming in and this was like k. through eighth um 

399.80 400.68 B: mhm 

401.45 402.41 A: (( yeah )) 

403.17 409.17 B: and that's an example of maturity the ability to appreciate the arts and music and not uh make a joke of everything [mn] 

407.24 416.69 A: yeah well well it's not even that because we had fifth graders who were i mean h- half i mean respect has to be taught you know i mean these people were really interested and they're asking 

416.57 425.51 A: i mean intelligent sorts of questions i mean it's almost like because we have a section afterwards where we talk to 'em i mean i think it's really gotta come from 

425.39 434.50 A: you know your your models of things on on all right this is the way we deal under the music group here you know we show them respect and things like that and then and then if you have 

431.78 432.66 B: mhm 

434.48 443.79 A: if if you know academics are really pushed and people are really all about learning then the other parts comes where after the performance is done they ask questions you know which are 

443.79 457.00 A: you know and it's it's a shame because it really came down to you know a lot of the the demographics of of different neighborhoods there were poor neighborhoods and things money i mean just the kinda questions and even how quick they would catch 

451.57 453.92 B: yes money mhm 

457.15 465.33 A: to concepts musically sometimes too of like uh like how fast like like remembering like one of the things we had to remember 

465.18 476.85 A: uh he was teaching 'em the ch- the conga rhythm for the cha cha and he would 'em like it was about eight different sounds and he'd give them one at a time and and just their memory skills of being able to remember one adding one at a time i mean 

468.17 469.03 B: mhm 

476.80 480.82 A: sometimes it was really like wow what's going on here you know 

479.82 481.97 B: [laughter] yeah 

481.21 482.46 A: but uh 

482.56 484.82 A: yeah i mean i think it's just gotta 

485.06 489.74 A: you know i don't know what the answer is i really i wish i knew what the answer is but i know 

489.54 495.97 B: well i'm i'm pretty sure there needs to be a different way of funding that isn't based on income in the area and property value 

489.75 490.74 A: um 

495.99 497.75 B: um something that 

496.43 498.94 A: what more of a pool type more of a pool 

497.80 503.35 B: yes yes but you know then people have to be willing to do that peop- you know the american people are not 

501.77 502.97 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

503.61 506.29 B: happy [laughter] about their taxation as it is so any 

506.31 517.79 B: you know redistribution of wealth is just something that you know many people out- outwardly oppose them in in administrations as they are with you know i mean there's pretty much no checks and balances going on right now [laughter] so 

506.39 508.56 A: (( i think yeah )) 

517.75 526.27 A: yeah well i think it's i think right now because it's being attached to property tax people think well if i'm paying all these taxes i want this money in my neighborhood you know 

517.94 518.84 B: (( you know )) 

525.23 531.14 B: mhm [lipsmack] i mean i went to i don't know if you've been to the newtown area but it has one of the the best uh 

529.59 530.65 A: (( yes )) 

531.24 532.11 A: mhm 

531.48 535.67 B: public school systems in you know in the country and uh my uh 

534.14 535.63 A: yeah oh definitely 

535.61 549.35 B: [lipsmack] my my boyfriend's little brother was you know raised in the kensington area uh school system until he was ten years old and it was horrid horrendous i mean his education was completely absent he was 

541.14 542.03 A: okay 

549.33 563.10 B: pretty much illiterate and you know he still has trouble with his multiplication tables and he's thirteen years old and he went into the newtown school system and he just did not know what to do with himself and at first he he was doing very very badly but they were so effective 

549.67 550.87 A: yeah 

554.60 555.55 A: wow 

562.99 568.82 B: and actually just last this this past monday we went in to to talk to his teachers about improving his grades and 

568.77 579.72 B: you know actually his teacher called us [laughter] you know wanting us to get involved and then we met all the teachers you know in the school and it was like going into a haven you know it was clean it was organized there was artwork everywhere the 

579.60 586.78 B: all the teachers were available they had after school programs they had before school programs it was amazing i'd never seen anything like that before in philadelphia anywhere 

579.95 581.46 A: yeah 

586.90 596.79 B: and you know when their when their schools are bad they're horrifying like you've you've never been in the ones in kensington or the area they're just i mean they're literally falling apart 

586.90 587.85 A: wow
