13.77 15.84 A: wow yes very much 

15.48 19.37 B: and i'm sure the schools are very different in pittsburgh 

18.53 22.82 A: yes yes i uh i'm i'm a teacher what about you 

22.29 23.48 B: you are 

22.96 23.91 A: yes 

23.50 26.31 B: oh i actually spent um 

26.48 30.06 B: about twenty two twenty three years in public education 

29.50 31.94 A: oh jeeze here we go [laughter] 

31.17 35.50 B: yeah i was uh an administrator for special ed 

33.04 33.86 A: i'm m- 

35.14 38.58 A: much much younger than you are i'm only twenty four 

38.23 40.07 B: oh you have kids 

39.59 43.78 A: uh no no i'm the youngest in the district though for gateway 

43.46 48.78 B: is that right yeah [laughter] well you have a long career ahead of you 

44.07 45.77 A: yep yep 

48.15 50.63 A: [laughter] yeah yeah 

50.03 57.33 B: so in your opinion coming as a this is interesting 'cause you've got a newcomer and you've got somebody whose been around for a while 

58.02 59.17 A: i uh 

58.09 61.00 B: are there serious problems in public schools 

60.61 62.02 A: (( i think )) 

62.17 71.22 A: that the problems aren't exactly serious quite yet but it is growing towards that rapidly 

71.56 75.74 A: i think uh a couple more years we'll be in a lot of trouble 

75.82 79.44 B: well what do you think are the trouble spots right now 

75.88 76.76 A: (( i think )) 

78.78 90.16 A: um definitely um reading math um arithmetic or the math um 

87.71 88.54 B: right 

88.64 90.82 B: you teach elementary or secondary 

90.38 92.53 A: uh i do uh ten to twelve 

93.45 96.72 A: twelve that's my class right now high school students so 

94.88 95.65 B: right 

98.01 104.05 B: so you're you're finding them coming in without the necessary arithmetic in order to do higher level mathematics 

102.25 115.58 A: absolutely absolutely and i think the problem starts even before the math and the reading um and what i mean by that is nobody can hold still long enough in their seats 

115.40 116.11 B: yeah 

115.95 121.08 A: and their attention span is very uh short 

120.77 121.66 B: (( yep )) 

121.13 127.69 A: i'm noticing a lot of instructors they talk for maybe thirty minutes at a time now 

127.80 128.58 B: huh 

128.30 132.66 A: when i was in high school gateway by the way i graduated in ninety seven 

133.11 135.83 A: i had to sit for an hour 

136.44 140.82 A: and i was capable of doing that [laughter] 

139.55 148.62 B: [noise] well you know what they've done around here is they've gone to double blocks so the kids don't have forty five minute classes they have classes that last an hour and a half 

143.50 144.62 A: mhm 

148.44 150.26 A: (( wow you )) 

149.32 151.09 B: yeah so imagine that 

150.79 158.86 A: you like [mn] you should be able to sit for an hour and a half and uh that's that's definitely not happening here 

158.71 159.59 B: yeah 

159.09 168.57 A: um the reading skills as i mentioned the math horrible i have kids um i have an eleventh grader doesn't even know what net or gross pay is 

168.75 170.36 A: (( uh which )) 

168.76 169.60 B: yeah 

170.87 172.52 A: you know oh boy 

172.93 173.86 B: yeah 

173.26 174.70 A: (( um well )) 

174.10 178.56 B: you only have one of those i would suspect you'd have quite a few of those actually 

176.20 177.35 A: well i 

177.38 180.20 A: i i do i do i didn't wanna [mn] 

180.32 185.39 A: didn't wanna it to just sound like everybody was the problem but yeah i do have quite a few uh 

184.41 185.49 B: yeah 

185.52 189.59 B: well real world math is not something they're exposed to yeah yeah 

188.05 200.08 A: right and i agree you know you should teach a real world math uh what they call consumer math but we should also expect our kids to at least get through algebra 

200.30 211.44 A: and uh i mean that's [mn] it takes a lot you know oh there there are a lot of students no oh i took algebra i hate it i'm not moving on 

200.63 201.83 B: well yeah 

203.59 205.48 B: (( yeah [laughter] oh )) 

211.42 220.31 A: and and the catch is they've already received the number of math credits that they need so they don't have to move on 

217.19 218.73 B: (( so gradually mm )) 

221.28 230.22 A: or you've taken you know so many credits and you have the option of taking a lower math so you don't have to do as much work 

229.81 232.32 B: right and that's what they're opting for 

231.65 240.24 A: yes and i i think that they should say well okay you've completed this level you're moving up you're moving up you've nowhere to go but to move up 

239.61 240.67 B: right 

240.28 242.45 A: um that's you know 

242.98 243.62 B: yeah 

243.22 244.60 A: (( [mn] i )) 

244.75 248.79 B: yeah i and if if i were to say you know one 

244.75 245.35 A: [mn] 

249.23 254.22 B: one major problem is too low an expectation 

254.29 256.55 B: by parents and 

256.63 266.35 B: um school systems in general i mean in the elementary grades of course i worked k. twelve as a special ed director 

264.43 265.42 A: right 

265.97 267.42 A: oh wow wow 

266.55 267.50 B: okay 

267.55 271.46 B: so i was exposed to the curriculum across the board 

271.45 272.03 A: (( yeah )) 

271.50 276.79 B: and you know [sigh] the big thing is make learning fun you know 

276.47 277.51 A: mhm 

277.09 284.94 B: a- and yeah you're you're gonna get a lot of them if it's fun but when they get out in the real world th- they're going to college guess what 

282.84 283.42 A: (( yeah )) 

284.49 286.63 A: it's not fun right 

285.44 288.04 B: you have to do work yeah 

286.85 287.75 A: right 

287.81 288.98 A: right 

288.17 290.84 B: [mn] and we're not teaching our kids that 

290.39 294.31 A: uh no no um [lipsmack] my kids 

294.39 297.76 A: they have to take notes real notebooks okay 

296.55 297.53 B: (( yep )) 

298.36 304.52 A: there are classes that i've seen there are no notebooks we forget to bring our pencils 

302.19 302.97 B: right 

304.54 305.36 B: (( oh yep )) 

304.94 306.79 A: um it 

305.81 308.81 B: not prepared no expectation yep [noise] 

307.32 311.65 A: right right and some of the 

311.80 319.15 A: well [lipsmack] how do you say the non a. p. class classes okay their parents 

319.39 323.82 A: really don't have any expectations for their kids they're not around 

322.45 324.77 B: right right right 

324.38 325.85 A: you know so 

324.86 325.67 B: right 

325.88 327.75 A: they they have 

327.79 329.64 A: nothing to back them up 

329.61 330.40 B: yeah 

329.74 333.59 A: you know and my thought is they know something's wrong 

334.19 341.78 A: but they don't quite know how to fix it because there's no mom or dad support you know it's 

341.14 341.95 B: yeah 

342.77 343.33 A: (( [mn] )) 

343.10 348.81 B: well without aspiration you know [laughter] aspirations is a big problem 

345.08 347.64 A: [laughter] that yeah but these kids 

348.10 351.20 A: exac- and it goes down yeah you just you know 

349.95 350.82 B: yeah 

350.91 357.01 B: and and the ones who do have aspirations we're not teaching them the skills they need to be successful in college 

355.14 356.25 A: no be- 

356.43 365.30 A: because the other kids are holding them back right right everything now has to pop up on a screen it has to be colorful flashy big 

358.39 359.93 B: (( yeah yep )) 

364.59 365.40 B: (( yep )) 

365.57 366.61 A: and 

365.79 367.20 B: like a video game 

366.69 372.05 A: yep yep we live in a video game generation and it's buh 

372.66 373.52 A: (( you know )) 

373.25 374.73 B: that's not life yep 

374.49 380.95 A: no absolutely not now life life to me is crab because i love seafood 

380.49 381.61 B: (( [laughter] )) 

380.98 382.07 A: [laughter] 

382.24 383.00 A: (( but )) 

383.68 387.33 A: you're right it's not there isn't you know 

387.34 388.97 A: we make it 

388.01 389.75 B: well how how do we fix it 

389.91 391.09 A: well 

391.20 392.97 A: (( [sigh] )) 

393.14 394.80 A: i don't know 

395.64 396.99 A: i think 

397.03 400.15 A: we need to make the parents more accountable 

399.97 400.67 B: (( yep )) 

400.99 413.45 A: i think in order uh to it diplomatically we wanna make the parents more accountable [lipsmack] the parents say well we have to both work so i can be there with my child 

411.44 412.27 B: right 

413.42 416.66 A: so as a society maybe we need to 

417.03 425.92 A: find ways that you know i think traditionally the woman may stay home or or um you know maybe the man 

425.93 438.86 A: but find a way that single you know or parents could work you know somebody go to work somebody stay home that that type of thing 'cause things are things in general are just too expensive 

438.94 439.77 B: yeah 

439.31 448.59 A: living so if you could change the way of living or the cost of it so that a parent could be home yeah that might be a good step too 

448.91 457.90 B: well it would be a step in the right direction but you know one thing that i've seen around here is we have a large contingency of parents in fact a a local woman at a 

457.95 462.85 B: a college wrote a book about um why students shouldn't have homework 

463.24 464.18 A: [mn] 

463.60 464.42 B: none 

464.74 465.79 B: no homework 

465.36 466.12 A: (( [laughter] )) 

466.46 467.36 A: (( oh )) 

466.47 468.68 B: at what you know how do you like that one 

468.49 469.52 A: i don't 

469.24 470.33 B: uh-huh 

469.99 472.43 A: i always had homework and 

471.36 476.66 B: well as an educator we know that practice is what's going to reinforce skills 

476.10 477.32 A: exactly 

476.87 479.48 B: right and and unless you repeat 

479.53 483.29 B: all of those skills and get that practice they're not going to master them 

481.69 482.53 A: right 

482.92 487.65 A: if if you're a genius you've got a good you know sporting chance but no 

487.75 488.37 A: (( [laughter] )) 

487.85 498.31 B: yeah otherwise otherwise you've you've got especially basic skills little kids you know so that they would come in with the arithmetic they need in order to have the concepts for 

488.39 489.38 A: practice 

491.88 492.72 A: right 

493.06 493.94 A: right 

493.95 494.85 A: and 

497.37 499.31 A: oh yeah yeah 

498.71 499.81 B: algebra 

500.08 503.68 B: and and we're just not doing it and we're not expecting it of them 

503.57 504.40 A: (( right )) 

503.83 509.69 B: and i think you could do it with with two parents working in the household as long as you had that time 

509.77 515.22 B: for before dinner you're not playing video games you're doing your homework 

513.78 514.59 A: right 

514.80 527.31 A: right [mn] when when i would come home it would be that way it would be uh you know come home i'd grab a bite you know do the homework and and be ready for dinner um 

523.29 525.46 B: (( a snack do your homework yeah )) 

528.73 530.45 A: [mn] another way 

530.88 532.27 A: (( [lipsmack] in uh )) 

532.33 543.72 A: is try to do i i always try to do things without blaming people although i i it's a very touch subject 'cause i just think you know we're in real big trouble as far as ed- education but 

543.12 543.91 B: (( yep [noise] )) 

543.87 546.60 A: i think if we actually made 

546.69 548.96 A: um the subjects 

549.38 559.32 A: uh [lipsmack] how do you say it like cool like if it were a cool thing to do math or a cool thing to do algebra even calculus 

554.62 555.50 B: mhm 

559.02 559.71 B: right 

559.74 561.45 A: if it were cool 

561.93 564.29 A: you know it it is dry 

564.31 568.65 A: you know but if it were cool if it were 

568.42 570.11 B: the in thing to do 

569.72 576.78 A: the in thing to do you would be okay but the the in thing to do is to watch survivor you know 

572.82 573.65 B: yeah 

576.05 577.45 B: right right 

576.79 577.63 A: which 

578.72 579.67 A: (( [mn] i don't know )) 

579.36 583.74 B: or go out to the mall at night and sit and party in the cars and 

582.08 584.89 A: yeah yeah um 

583.95 584.84 B: yeah 

585.80 590.46 A: i know plenty of my kids stay up well past midnight which 

589.37 590.01 B: (( yep )) 

590.49 594.58 A: i'm sure we've all done it but it doesn't help 

594.21 596.77 B: they do it routinely yeah 

595.40 599.45 A: yes their sleeping patterns are way off way off 

599.07 599.89 B: yeah
