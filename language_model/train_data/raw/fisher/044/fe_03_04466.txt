101.00 110.54 B: the wealthy schools you can't put a wealthy school and their educators and their children and all the materials and resources that they have and compare it to an inner city school 

110.84 118.29 B: like in los angeles your inner schools i'm sure san francisco might have must must have some too the inner city versus the you know the the rich 

118.59 131.22 B: wealthy wealthy school system you can't compare they're they're not apples and apples they're apples and oranges it's uncomparable and bush's law of kids first they can transfer at will and they can go if they're in a failing school they could leave

278.85 283.68 A: i read uh a book when i was in uh school about two years ago it was about uh 

283.97 293.46 A: forgotten 'bout schools in um they compared schools they compared um they compared a upper scale school in new york like for the rich the the rich 

293.23 294.09 B: mhm 

294.14 301.58 A: and how they had everything they need and then they compared it to schools in um like the in- inner city and there's just 

301.93 303.25 A: they had uh 

303.45 316.45 A: the person who wrote the book went to the uh the schools and then he he described them what they lack what they don't have and it was kinda sad to realize there were some some parts of the country that they don't they don't have nothing pretty much 

316.09 328.72 B: ex- yeah i mean i i took some classes i took some you know master's classes in college and it and i'm like this is ridiculous i i withdrew from the class because my col- my classmates were complaining that the children 

328.78 342.46 B: there are children in the upper echelon let's call it classes there that they've taught that didn't have you know the latest stat or the latest you know c. d. i'm like my kids are upset because they haven't had breakfast in the morning 

342.59 355.00 B: and like let's put you know let's we can't compare your children that haven't gone to paris over spring break and and my children haven't eaten over spring break bec- or had a meal a decent meal over spring break 'cause school was closed [laughter] i mean 

354.95 362.54 B: like we are on two different levels to those people so i had to withdraw it was just mind boggling that that's what they were worried about their children had those problems 

362.59 372.33 B: or concerns and i my children's concerns were oh my god school's going to be closed for you know seven days nine days in- including the two weekends and they weren't going to have a decent meal [laughter] 

372.83 376.65 B: i'm like forget it let's close out of this school let's close out of this college class 

377.84 387.02 B: but yeah as you as you said it's you know the up- you know the upper schools in new york and that and the inner schools it's it's the resources are not available 

387.68 392.11 B: and everyone's like well put your children into private school well that costs money also 

392.12 394.37 A: [mn] [noise] yeah it does cost money 

393.62 402.07 B: yeah and in private schools they could they could they could say no i don't like you for whatever purpose and reason and and get rid of you as a as a student 

402.31 404.51 B: i mean that's how they are on the east coast at least [laughter] 

404.87 410.10 B: you know they could make up any ramification and say your child's doing this and get out you know oh 

405.77 406.47 A: (( so )) 

409.19 412.25 A: oh they're not that bad over here i i went to a private school 

412.42 417.16 B: [mn] and that's they are now the elementary schools i went to private school in i went to you know 

417.56 421.27 B: catholic schools growing up but i teach in a public school because that's where 

421.32 423.24 B: i can see the need is [laughter] 

423.41 427.50 B: somebody has to stick up for these and be the voice for these parents which is another thing the parents 

427.83 438.74 B: aren't getting there's no there's no parental support well excuse me let let me rephrase that there's not a lot of parent parental support in the inner city because a lot of inner city teachers parents rather are afraid 

439.16 450.38 B: to come in and confront a teacher about a subject anything happen in you know in upper echelon schools it's like you know mommy and dad are going to be right in there and grandma and the whole neighborhood are going to be there to help me out 

450.29 459.78 B: and sometimes it's like you know when a when a child in the inner city gets in trouble or or has a problem it's like [mn] the teacher must know best well no talk to the teacher 'cause maybe the child was right 

460.36 463.21 B: and get involved in your child's life and the academics 

463.98 469.34 B: but it also breaks down into the the family situation where they may not have time 'cause the parent has to work 

470.08 474.31 B: you know my mom and dad both had my mom and dad both had to work to keep me in the private school 

470.45 471.64 A: yeah that's true 

474.34 486.32 B: for the you know for m- middle school and high school and i i lost a lot on that you know family time on that but [lipsmack] they thought it was better and i my friends that were in public schools whose parents weren't working weren't even involved in their 

474.83 475.86 A: yep 

486.45 490.75 B: their their uh my friends when they were in high school and middle school they weren't even involved in their life 

493.21 498.17 B: but what do you think could be what was our next question what could be done to correct it or [laughter] 

497.84 500.22 A: what could be done to correct it [mn] 

499.86 502.45 B: i think the class size has a lot to do with it 

503.13 507.13 A: mon- money's the biggest one though money is like uh 

507.54 518.87 A: they say there's no money yeah money's always the problem there's always a fight 'cause of money or some- it always stems back to money you know there's there's lots of other factors money's the big issue 

507.89 509.80 B: the root of all evil [laughter] 

518.97 520.84 A: and just they need to 

521.37 530.02 A: not spend eighty seven billion or how eighty five billion dollars on you know on a war put that money into a damn school 

527.68 528.49 B: (( right )) 

529.40 531.96 B: right you know what i saw a date line um 

532.24 533.15 B: um 

533.18 545.30 B: segment a couple of years ago and they were spend- they had made a comment that they spend more money building brand new prisons and giving all the amenities to the prisons and they should take 

545.57 555.48 B: ten like even ten percent ray take ten percent of that money and put it towards a school and maybe some of those people that are filling the prisons wouldn't be in them because they've had a better education 

555.66 567.86 A: they do that because uh prisons are the out here in california prisons are the biggest money makers like the the new business because what they do is they get private private owners that build the prisons 

566.61 568.77 B: (( [mn] private bac- backers yeah )) 

568.50 576.03 A: and then they rent it out to the state and they collect money on every single prisoner every single day and it's a lotta money 

574.29 574.94 B: (( if it )) 

575.34 583.90 B: but wouldn't you rather have not i mean but if you have a choice of making this money making activity of of housing a you know backing a prison financially 

583.92 590.69 B: or educating the children when they're younger and using some of those dollars to educate the children to keep these people out of prison 

591.28 599.52 B: i mean it's like the the the news is saying the prisons are overcrowded well you know if you use some of the money that you're putting towards building these beautiful resorts
