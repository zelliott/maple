11.84 14.14 A: calling from the bay area 

14.72 19.16 B: okay now i'm down in florida that could be tampa bay or that could be san francisco or 

17.80 20.47 A: (( ah san francisco bay area w- )) 

19.29 20.50 B: okay 

21.01 24.86 B: opposite sides of the country yeah 

22.54 24.28 A: yeah 

25.96 28.29 A: so about the topic ah 

29.58 31.46 A: would you take the million dollars 

32.81 44.95 B: um i don't know that's interesting ah you know one part of me says yes i'd take it ah y- you know i don't believe that there is 

44.71 49.70 B: ah a limit on the number of friends that a person 

49.84 52.18 B: you know can have that if you lose a 

52.45 57.86 B: best friend you know when you're ah twenty that ah 

58.63 59.84 B: (( you know that ah )) 

60.95 65.07 B: there'll never be another quote unquote best friend to come along 

65.22 66.33 A: yeah 

65.56 71.53 B: um i think it's kind of a a you know one of those typical political ah 

71.76 75.77 B: questions that puts two unrelated things together 

76.02 82.85 B: and because a lot ah a lot of good could be done with a million dollars a lot of bad could be done with it too but um 

83.83 93.81 B: you know ah [sigh] who's to say that a year from now that you're you're today best friend ah may no longer be your best friend for any variety of reasons so 

94.32 97.47 B: uh yeah i'd take it how 'bout you 

96.32 97.94 A: (( yeah i'd probably take it too )) 

98.49 99.37 A: (( um )) 

100.04 103.68 A: yeah just 'cause like i'm only eighteen years old and uh 

103.01 107.36 B: oh okay good well i'm at the other end of the spectrum i'll be sixty in a couple of weeks 

106.77 108.65 A: yeah so 

109.08 111.86 A: like the friends i have now are 

111.45 112.52 B: mhm 

111.89 116.25 A: becoming more impermanent 'cause like we're all going our separate ways next year 

116.06 117.18 B: sure 

116.84 117.85 A: and so 

118.37 121.89 A: uh there aren't many things that would stop me from taking the money 

121.60 123.79 B: no uh-uh and and uh 

125.17 131.00 B: you know the uh [cough] that's interesting at eighteen i'm trying to think back now that uh 

131.41 132.89 B: uh 

133.25 138.57 B: people particularly in a society as mobile as ours do tend to drift um 

139.73 143.90 B: and you know you may reconnect [cough] 

145.07 150.28 B: with friends at high school reunions or college reunions down the road but um 

150.58 157.85 B: the intensity of the friendship i don't think uh remains throughout life at least that has not been my experience 

157.93 167.64 B: you know where it's still good to see these guys when you go back there twenty thirty you know thirty five years later ah y- you do tend to go 

168.20 178.58 B: your own ways ah you go to different colleges you enter different career paths you grow um in different ways ah 

177.43 178.30 A: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

178.81 185.94 B: you know uh politically religiously ah socially um and ah that's just life 

186.16 190.90 B: life is uh life is a ah growth process hopefully 

191.15 192.44 B: (( and um )) 

192.89 203.59 B: that's not to uh in any way shape or form ah minimize or denigrate uh friendship but ah it's just a a realization that uh 

204.38 206.00 B: you know that uh 

206.19 207.96 B: friends come friends go 

207.89 209.35 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

209.53 215.36 B: so do [laughter] so do millions [laughter] just like at the stock market the last couple of years 

215.39 218.77 B: you know ah millions come and millions go ah 

218.47 219.77 A: (( yeah yeah that they do )) 

221.97 223.93 B: but ah i i hope 

225.34 235.35 B: [cough] that future questions if you're on this for more than one question i don't know how often they call you back but ah i hate these questions where they load [mn] 

236.15 237.25 B: (( you )) 

237.83 240.31 B: know that they put ah 

240.62 242.92 B: they're they're ah complex 

242.98 246.15 B: complex in that there's two thoughts in the same question 

246.08 247.08 A: yeah 

246.31 253.60 B: you know and uh one doesn't really necessarily have anything directly to do with the other so 

253.07 254.83 A: how many of these calls have you done mm 

254.08 255.98 B: this is my first one 

256.72 263.74 B: yeah they've they've tried a couple of times during the day but i've never been home so ah i'm sitting here watching a basketball game tonight uh 

263.82 271.44 B: prestons and the seventy sixers and reading a magazine and you know getting ready to go to bed pretty soon it's ah 

271.94 273.88 B: about ten after ten here 

273.53 275.24 A: mhm 

275.02 278.80 B: but the basketball game is pretty good so that'll keep me up 'til the news and then uh

292.81 293.83 B: which one 

293.50 296.97 A: humble state which is actually in california but u- up north 

297.03 300.09 B: [mn] okay up north near w- uh sacramento or 

299.78 301.94 A: uh even farther up by oregon 

301.76 306.60 B: oh wow okay well that's pretty country up there yeah yeah 

302.46 303.28 A: yeah 

304.46 305.51 A: yeah it is 

310.48 314.55 B: [mn] so what else is going on in uh california that's uh 

315.80 317.02 B: that's exciting 

317.75 318.63 A: uh 

319.12 320.55 A: not much 

320.07 324.92 B: i i just y- you know what makes the news here uh is just the uh 

325.33 327.11 B: the tremendous ah 

327.56 329.72 B: debt that the state is incurring 

332.29 339.45 B: you know d- d- d- depending upon on who who you listen to by because of mismanagement by the current governor or 

339.74 344.65 B: uh you know just the state of the economy in general 

344.91 350.58 B: but in n- not just california there's a lot of states that are really hurting now and looking at increased 

348.63 352.41 A: yeah especially around the bay area i'm from like 

351.88 353.04 B: pardon me 

352.58 359.56 A: e- especially around where i'm from a lot of the people have no work because like my mom has been trying to get work for two years now and like 

359.64 361.63 A: uh when 

359.64 361.13 B: oh wow 

361.78 366.60 A: the economy was good she could have gotten work in many places and 

366.33 368.13 B: yeah 

367.01 367.80 A: like 

368.74 372.23 A: uh she searches all day long every day and she gets nothing 

371.90 375.56 B: oh that can be so draining uh 

373.76 374.82 A: yeah 

376.39 384.86 B: you know just pounding the pavement or you know pounding the phones looking for looking for work it's not too bad 

385.20 400.17 B: here in uh in florida uh for some reason although i'm sure that there are probably pockets in miami and in west palm beach and and that where work is hard to find but generally i think the um 

400.02 409.55 B: the unemployment rate here uh which doesn't mean squat if you don't have a job but the rate is i think is somewhat below the national average so 

410.67 413.79 B: which is a- amazing what with this 

413.96 416.33 B: sars scare that um 

416.38 423.05 B: so much of our economy here and i imagine in many parts of california too is based on tourists 

423.15 424.17 B: um 

424.73 426.09 B: (( um )) 

426.59 431.47 B: you know that our unemployment rate isn't higher because a lot of people particularly from uh 

431.94 435.84 B: from overseas are are just not travelling as much as they used to 

437.28 441.32 B: that on top of nine eleven which you know i think everybody is still 

442.71 444.80 B: suffering from the effects of that 

444.35 447.02 A: mhm yeah that totally affected everybody 

447.48 449.34 A: and there's no way around it 

448.63 450.56 B: yeah 

450.83 453.60 B: so what do you think you're going to be majoring in when you get to college 

453.69 455.87 A: uh i haven't thought about that yet 

455.08 459.18 B: okay it's still early it's still real early yeah
