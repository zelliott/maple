39.32 47.65 B: i was i think at the previous school they were at because they went to school up in washington and uh

68.63 72.59 A: you know californian schools have all sorts of um 

73.62 80.68 A: people have all sorts of opinions about them and we chose to home school our girls because um 

79.38 80.15 B: oh 

81.08 86.03 A: for us public school wasn't an option for them [laughter] um 

84.68 85.83 B: uh-huh 

86.14 92.81 A: and i went to school to be a teacher and i remember one of the um 

92.93 93.83 A: most 

94.52 97.59 A: poignant statements that was made to me 

97.75 101.00 A: during my education was that as a teacher 

101.35 103.98 A: your classroom is the fourth of 

104.02 107.45 A: the living room of every single student in your class 

107.41 109.50 B: (( mhm )) 

107.95 112.24 A: and you they're allowing you into their lives and their homes and their you know 

113.39 123.91 A: take your responsibility very serious and i think that sadly there are very few public school teachers that are able to do that any more 

123.54 126.67 B: yeah i agree 

124.38 125.18 A: and 

126.42 128.73 A: and so for us um 

128.89 130.03 A: it was 

130.29 138.96 A: i have a daughter that in she's a junior in high school and i have a daughter in eighth grade and neither of them have ever been to school 

138.87 140.02 B: gosh 

139.79 141.38 A: um they 

141.55 144.87 A: uh take some classes here and there um 

145.83 151.12 A: tori my eighth grader is taking a science class and um at a 

151.85 152.64 A: a 

152.76 155.08 A: it's a private school really um 

155.13 155.91 A: it's 

156.13 161.87 A: and vanessa has taken um she's had math tutors from um 

162.48 171.28 A: pacific university is very near where we used to live and so we had one of the students from the university was a math tutor for her 

171.43 172.97 A: and um 

173.74 174.86 A: so 

175.06 176.45 A: uh we do 

177.02 192.02 A: all sorts of different things both the girls take music lessons um vanessa plays guitar and it turns out she has um a very famous guitar teacher which when we were looking we had no idea he'd been on a world tour with somebody you know 

193.89 194.99 A: famous 

195.19 199.36 B: (( oh [laughter] )) 

195.26 196.23 A: (( and )) 

196.40 203.80 A: it's and tori plays piano and they're just really involved in a whole bunch of things and 

200.88 201.54 B: (( mm )) 

202.69 207.10 B: well that that's so neat i mean i have to admire people that 

207.13 208.16 B: um 

208.41 212.41 B: home school their kids 'cause i don't think i could do it 

212.09 215.31 A: you coulda done it you could you don't 

214.18 219.05 B: i don't i just don't think i would have the discipline you know to 

219.73 223.89 B: constantly you know keep on it and uh 

225.05 227.27 B: i don't know [laughter] 

225.17 226.03 A: well 

226.85 227.99 A: i think 

228.17 233.26 A: it it's with public education i guess that's what we're supposed to be talking about more 

232.83 235.02 B: yeah 

233.52 235.99 A: um is um 

236.61 240.05 A: you still tend to home school your kids anyway 

240.02 243.69 B: yeah i guess i see that 

242.44 244.55 A: i think you know you 

245.11 249.08 A: they're in class you know six hours a day and 

249.17 250.26 A: (( um bring )) 

250.67 253.18 A: a couple of hours of homework home every day 

253.25 255.34 B: mhm 

253.51 261.19 A: and if you know they don't get it or don't do it you're the one that has to help them with it 

260.59 263.14 B: yeah that's true that's true 

262.80 267.65 A: and so i think you know a lot of people view um 

270.09 273.11 A: a teacher just can't be everything 

273.20 276.17 B: right yeah 

273.69 278.63 A: they just can't there's there's no way that you can teach 

279.10 280.49 A: a class 

281.01 284.68 A: at a certain pace when you have kids 

284.73 286.86 A: that are excelling 

287.63 292.46 A: and then you have kids that are not getting it and then 

290.15 292.79 B: (( mhm )) 

293.33 295.27 A: you've got kids in the middle 

295.34 297.62 A: so what do you do 

297.45 309.95 B: yeah i mean i yeah i guess you know i can see both sides you know like you say the teacher can't do everything but then i see the side where there's 

305.87 307.70 A: no they can't 

309.89 313.34 B: so many students and only one teacher 

312.49 313.61 A: right 

313.37 315.03 B: and um 

315.02 324.92 A: it's very very i it's so challenging i did student teaching in third grade for third grade and for seventh grade and it was um 

325.61 330.65 A: the the variation in the capability of the students 

330.84 334.10 B: right uh-huh 

331.65 336.64 A: was so obvious and you don't want to hold back 

336.77 340.52 A: the kids that are just excelling 

340.53 343.99 A: but you don't want to leave the other guys behind 

343.55 350.36 B: yeah i mean i can remember that now what you say that as i went to school you know sometimes 

350.20 359.67 B: you'd like be ahead of the other ones or sometimes you would be be behind the other ones and i guess that really would be hard for a teacher 

351.82 353.17 A: mhm 

359.53 364.81 A: i think it would be just tremendously hard and then when you have all the peer pressure and you have all the 

364.97 367.70 A: stuff going on and you know 

368.10 370.93 A: everything that kids bring to school 

371.06 372.78 A: in their mind 

372.42 374.78 B: (( mhm )) 

373.32 377.18 A: you know it just is going great at home 

377.26 380.08 A: i mean that seems to be very rare 

379.81 382.18 B: (( mhm )) 

380.71 386.83 A: you know and then they get to school and you know mom's here and dad's there and i mean they just come in 

386.93 390.70 A: they're so frazzled and so vulnerable and 

391.11 396.30 A: to to expect a teacher to just be able to handle all of that 

396.44 399.08 A: especially for a low wage 

396.57 397.70 B: yeah 

398.94 401.17 B: (( mhm )) 

399.88 410.72 A: you know when we play pay baseball players and basketball players and movie stars millions of dollars and pay teachers so poorly 

405.06 408.71 B: yeah 

410.90 413.78 A: i think that's just which is sad 

413.64 419.71 B: yeah so i wonder what the solution is [laughter] 

419.60 420.52 A: (( mm )) 

421.07 422.33 A: well i think 

421.58 424.12 B: as far as public schools 

424.03 425.02 A: it's 

425.06 434.17 A: i think more money in the teachers' pockets would help i think help having families be 

429.84 431.76 B: mhm 

434.48 439.08 A: as responsible as they can and as involved as they can 

436.90 441.01 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

439.67 442.12 A: that that's gotta help 

442.16 446.76 A: you know the kids that seem to do the best um 

447.66 453.23 A: around here in school are the kids whose parents are pretty involved 

453.35 455.04 B: (( mhm )) 

454.72 457.61 A: checking on uh making sure how they're doing 

457.30 464.86 B: right yeah i think that's probably the case anywhere um 

462.91 464.43 A: mhm 

465.58 470.36 B: and sad to say that not every family is that way 

469.96 475.19 A: no they're really not and you know i love um 

475.62 477.85 A: the volunteer programs where 

478.06 481.49 A: you know there's after school tutors that'll come and help 

481.14 483.48 B: (( mhm )) 

482.04 483.57 A: you know it's it 

483.71 486.16 A: the with vanessa my older daughter 

486.43 490.19 A: i i knew she was at a spot that she would 

490.51 491.45 A: um 

491.48 492.42 A: take 

493.84 495.57 A: directions from 

495.84 499.41 A: someone that was just a little bit older than her 

499.55 504.37 A: college wise you know that's why we looked for a college student 

500.89 502.34 B: (( mhm )) 

503.69 508.36 B: mhm yeah 

504.68 506.18 A: to tutor her 

507.01 508.85 A: and um 

509.15 511.94 A: you know i really think that 

512.00 515.38 A: there are so many kids in high school that 

515.44 517.33 A: do service projects 

517.15 519.46 B: mhm 

518.00 523.10 A: maybe they could do some service projects at the grade schools for the kids that need help 

522.87 526.57 B: yeah mhm 

525.24 528.41 A: i mean i know my niece right now is going 

528.44 534.32 A: with she just graduated from high school and she's going with her band director to middle school 

534.35 539.13 A: to talk to kids about sticking with band when you get to high school 

539.02 540.82 B: mm that's neat 

540.28 548.99 A: and of i mean they had five hundred students graduate and they have a great big marching band and she was the one person that 

549.13 553.11 A: the band director wanted to go to the junior high with him 

553.05 554.25 B: (( mm )) 

553.64 566.58 A: and it was just such a neat opportunity for her and you know if kids are doing service projects maybe they could you know even if you did it for six weeks 

562.91 565.03 B: (( mhm )) 

566.43 576.60 B: right because that's important too to them you know um besides the education i mean um 

575.52 577.85 A: the extracurricular things 

577.16 580.65 B: yeah their other skills i mean like in 

580.96 590.02 B: i think it's important that they have encouragement and you know to say that they did a good job and uh 

584.50 585.83 A: mhm 

590.70 596.80 B: i always try to do that with my grandkids [laughter] yeah 

592.92 595.73 A: oh that's so important and 

595.81 599.22 A: you know sometimes if you've got a grandmother that'll help you
