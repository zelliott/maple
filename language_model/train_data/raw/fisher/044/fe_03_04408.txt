293.71 294.92 A: yeah 

294.28 299.92 B: for the kids but i really think that ah growing up in the city was a much different experience 

299.07 308.75 A: yeah but you know when i grew up there it was ah you know a completely different thing not like today i manage and you know armed with all the things i hear you know well anywhere 

308.72 309.82 B: mhm 

309.24 313.97 A: you know the ah the ah problems and everything you know

330.31 331.18 B: (( [laughter] )) 

330.55 345.30 A: and [laughter] that was a business deal and ah i do want to go down there you know and come back and you know check it out i'll probably be miserable but still you know i have dreams every once in a while i'm back in new york and i'm walking down the street and i go am i really here 

345.09 346.06 B: well 

345.22 346.17 A: i don't know 

346.33 353.80 B: my my company transferred me to evansville indiana for awhile which is at the very southern tip of indiana 

350.55 351.50 A: oh 

353.24 354.66 A: oh is it it's 

354.01 362.54 B: and it was so different living out in the mid west i lived there for about six years it was so different compared to new york 

358.93 359.87 A: uh-huh 

362.39 363.59 A: (( ah yeah )) 

362.75 367.35 B: um much much slower paced life cycle out there 

365.85 368.07 A: right yeah 

367.37 379.67 B: um you you go into a re- ah not a restaurant but a food store and you'll look for things that you're used to getting in new york that you find with no problem and you can't find it out there because it's not ethnic to that area 

379.11 380.68 A: right right 

379.96 384.12 B: um so after living in the mid west and living in new york it's 

384.25 390.78 B: there's no place like new york or or even california major city noth- it's n -there's no place like it 

386.06 386.99 A: yeah 

387.96 389.40 A: right yeah 

391.11 392.02 B: so 

391.40 396.43 A: oh we we we still talk about the food in new york compared to here you can't get it you know 

395.96 399.92 B: yeah that that's one thing new york has got tremendous food [laughter] 

396.55 398.33 A: and the deli you know 

399.21 404.09 A: yeah yeah oh one of these days hopefully i'll be able to go there 

404.61 410.09 A: yeah i have a friend also that lives in oklahoma in the mid west and 

405.50 406.89 B: yeah it's not an easy 

409.11 410.16 B: mhm 

410.22 424.37 A: ah he keeps saying why don't you come out here and live [mn] there's a home here it's like forty thousand dollars it's made out of brick and it's got like ten acres with it they're selling [laughter] yes but you got you know you you go where the you know it's cheaper it's there's a reason you know 

414.70 415.91 B: [laughter] 

418.80 419.65 B: yeah 

424.26 425.09 B: yeah 

424.39 427.32 A: and he and he just ah what was it they had the ah 

427.83 431.56 A: hurricanes and everything went through there the other week and boy 

430.13 431.12 B: (( yeah )) 

430.92 433.22 B: that that's the drawback to it 

432.27 434.71 A: right yeah and he 

433.02 435.39 B: [laughter] you know the other thing is 

435.15 448.73 B: um you know like like you said you're you're older i'm older if if you were looking to retire that's the type of place to do it because you buy the house and you're free and clear you know you you can't retire and live in new york very easily 

438.38 439.38 A: yeah 

440.49 441.27 A: uh-huh 

443.66 446.19 A: right yeah i was yeah yeah 

447.53 448.94 A: no no 

448.50 451.22 B: the the prices are just too high on things 

449.77 451.58 A: no no 

451.44 453.83 B: (( but um )) 

452.01 457.38 A: unless you gave up your best friend and had the million dollars right [laughter] 

454.63 456.01 B: (( yeah there you go )) 

456.73 457.69 B: [laughter] 

457.68 459.80 A: you sound like a hell of a nice guy 

459.47 460.96 B: yeah thank you 

460.60 462.02 A: yeah ah 

462.67 465.32 A: it's a kind of a different deal we've got going here 

465.35 466.22 B: (( yeah )) 

466.19 467.33 A: so 

466.63 478.88 B: i i it it's funny because i think the their the survey was probably expecting people to say no they wouldn't give up their friend they probably didn't plan on running into two guys like us that don't have any more friends [laughter] 

473.38 474.69 A: [laughter] 

476.66 480.74 A: [laughter] there there you go [laughter] 

478.72 492.96 B: you know [laughter] even even um you know the guys that were in my wedding party when i got married they've all moved away or deceased at this point or you know have their own lives and worlds and 

486.08 486.99 A: yeah 

487.68 488.80 A: yeah 

489.55 490.94 A: right 

491.37 501.41 A: right right and then go ah complaining about everything and ah one of my friends has a a lung re- removed and this one has something else happened to him boy 

498.24 499.28 B: yeah 

500.98 507.56 B: and and now the only time you see friends from what i'll say is the old neighbourhood or the old friends is you know at a wedding or a funeral 

507.27 508.15 A: yeah 

507.61 511.58 B: other than that it's it's you don't socialize the way you used to any more 

510.64 514.94 A: no no family ties aren't that great either lately 

514.70 515.68 B: yeah 

515.49 522.68 A: you know to we we used to have a close knit family too and i don't know it just you know everybody kind of scattered around 

521.95 523.04 B: mhm 

522.71 524.65 A: yeah 

525.52 531.99 B: yeah we've we've done that too as families have gotten married and things like that they extend and move away and 

525.62 526.70 A: (( and so )) 

531.38 540.14 A: yeah yeah well we got the ah ah you know the computers going with the email and so i was ah ah 

537.28 538.24 B: mhm 

540.40 549.68 A: found out by some relatives in south africa and some other ones from here and there you know and ah they find you through the i don't know one you know these ancestry ah 

549.43 550.41 B: yeah 

550.17 551.57 A: (( what do you call them ah )) 

551.45 553.22 B: through through the internet searches 

552.75 557.03 A: yeah yeah yeah so we get acquainted like that for a while and that goes 

557.05 561.77 A: they send pictures and we send pictures and it's a kind of interesting mix 

559.38 560.44 B: (( mhm )) 

561.61 571.61 B: yeah we we do the same thing we keep in touch with friends that we have out in arizona um he recently retired and moved out there because he couldn't afford staying in new york [laughter] 

565.73 566.85 A: yeah 

568.83 570.53 A: yeah that's another retirement 

570.60 573.31 A: yeah that's another retirement place arizona 

572.96 582.62 B: yeah so um what happened though was that you know through him being out there that's how we keep in touch because it's basically for free [laughter] [laughter] [noise] 

573.58 574.91 A: and ah i think 

581.15 582.06 A: yeah 

582.86 583.58 A: (( is it )) 

585.42 587.08 A: somebody was whistling i was trying 

586.96 588.48 B: [laughter] 

587.52 591.16 A: [laughter] yeah that's ah saves money too 

590.87 592.01 B: yeah 

591.35 592.97 A: yeah 

592.31 599.84 B: and it it's nice because like you said you can do the pictures you can ah you know type a note or a letter you know whatever you want to do 

599.11 599.95 A: right
