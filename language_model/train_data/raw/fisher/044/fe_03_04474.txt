5.48 6.94 B: hello how are you 

6.52 8.78 A: oh not too bad how about yourself 

8.16 10.88 B: i'm doing just fine i'm doing beautifully 

10.33 12.78 A: oh that that sounds good 

12.11 16.69 B: yes so we're talking today about public schools is that correct 

16.12 17.38 A: yes 

17.20 19.77 B: [mn] that's really something isn't it [laughter] 

19.32 21.06 A: definitely we 

20.99 21.95 B: yes 

21.63 24.79 A: it's unfortunate because i went to private school but 

24.29 30.23 B: well how about that i'm sure your opinion is just as valid as the public school people i i would assume 

28.85 32.78 A: well i ah teach in a public school so 

32.68 38.21 B: how about that well that that's some better inbuilts there for you right there 

33.23 34.41 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

37.53 39.21 A: oh definitely 

38.97 50.37 B: so maybe you should start first seeing that you may have a little bit more knowledge on it i used to teach in a catholic school uh seventh grade as a and as a home room teacher in the eighth grade 

49.59 54.18 A: oh did you really oh yeah that's where i went to school a catholic school 

50.52 51.74 B: yes 

53.74 57.37 B: so we're just kinda like on opposite sides i guess huh uh 

56.65 58.46 A: sure sure 

58.83 60.43 A: well i um 

61.14 66.40 A: i'm concerned about the uh you know i'm trying to think of a question you know 

65.06 66.01 B: yes 

66.53 67.60 A: um 

67.51 75.37 B: it said the changing or the the the effect of public schools or what could make them more effective i think i think that's what i gathered from it 

74.81 77.76 A: sure i think that um 

78.83 83.20 A: there needs to be more funding to the public school system 

82.79 84.75 B: i see mm 

83.35 90.37 A: or different programs i know in the state that i live in a lot of the programs are being cut 

90.45 92.95 A: because um 

93.12 99.69 A: of well the government is claiming inadequate you know they have inadequate um 

100.17 103.41 A: funds to help the school system 

103.67 112.14 A: um one of the things in the public school system that they're cutting they're cutting the arts and they're cutting music 

110.47 112.67 B: mm 

112.36 116.34 A: and um and the the music courses 

116.39 118.86 A: and they're keeping other sports 

119.72 120.76 A: um 

121.97 134.80 A: you know things that are happening with the school um so it doesn't really it's not well round it's not going to be a well rounded education and that's the way i feel 

124.92 125.81 B: right 

134.41 135.51 B: i see 

134.92 138.01 A: uh because of you know lack of funding 

138.10 148.89 A: and with the increase in taxes uh not only local but statewide a lot of parents um and a lot of school districts um 

149.06 151.31 A: hate to ask uh 

151.35 155.15 A: you know the the residents of the their district 

155.17 159.42 A: if they could uh put more you know or uh 

159.81 165.08 A: pay a little bit more tax money because people are already up in arms [laughter] anyway 

161.55 162.58 B: i see 

164.68 165.84 B: right 

165.17 168.00 A: but uh what do you think 

167.41 171.32 B: well i personally think but can you tell me your name once more uh 

170.56 172.14 A: (( sure it's annie )) 

171.81 173.00 B: danni 

172.57 173.68 A: annie 

173.10 178.01 B: annie okay annie's fine just as well that's right uh annie i think 

173.85 174.91 A: right 

178.18 185.19 B: it was always my opinion in public school when i attended public schools many years ago that i attended uh 

185.34 198.05 B: we needed to make it more accessible to the to the people who attended there the high school kids a lot of kids they go to high school don't see the point of high school or they think it's just a stepping stone to college 

197.62 198.52 A: sure 

198.10 210.48 B: they really don't see the value of it which is why i think a lot of them want to leave and get out of it as soon as possible uh i think it would be i would like to see a program where people who interned 

204.23 205.17 A: sure 

210.32 222.54 B: as high school students and went on to have great careers in whatever field they pursue would come back and whether it be volunteer or not uh 

222.65 234.85 B: there needs to be a greater connection between high school and a real so called so called real world where you have people that are business professionals in whatever field that the high school kids are interested in 

234.38 235.35 A: yes 

234.85 239.49 B: and they come back and set up an internship program with their company 

239.26 251.77 B: or they set up some type of program where the kids in high school can begin training or acting as an apprentice or intern or something of that sort in the real world and get some skills so that 

251.83 256.67 B: high school becomes more practical to them i i would assume uh 

255.72 257.98 A: do do you think that um 

258.46 266.82 A: a lot of kids are leaving school and what could uh you know the school staff do 

266.91 271.23 A: to keep them in you know high schools instead of quitting 

269.92 270.65 B: i 

270.95 275.74 B: as i said before the thing that i think is to help someone with their dream 

275.24 276.24 A: mhm 

275.79 286.94 B: when i was in high school i had a desire to possibly act and write and you know do film things of that nature if some people from from the film industry 

280.91 281.47 A: (( [mn] )) 

286.92 301.58 B: could could set up an internship you know or as i said before there if if they could set up something for these high school kids to do that maybe they could pursue after they get out of high school then high school wouldn't seem so 

290.65 291.54 A: sure 

301.69 314.20 B: i remember when i went to high school it seemed just like a a waste of time you know i i'm glad i did well in it and i exceeded because for some strange reason i thought it would help and it did help a great deal but 

306.56 307.63 A: yeah 

314.22 316.68 B: there needs to be a more uh 

316.77 319.21 B: practical use for it or 

318.37 319.50 A: yes 

319.01 327.62 B: or the kids need to see the to realize the practical use of it and as i said before a great idea would be internships 

327.43 334.62 B: apprenticeships or volunteer shifts and and some of these things don't cost anything to the particular school 

334.30 335.14 A: yes 

334.75 344.89 B: maybe a teacher knows someone who's in the business and says can you come and speak to these kids you know or maybe a teacher should should uh 

345.08 357.46 B: get a kid and ask them you know what are your dreams or aspirations uh a lot of times people and teachers teach and they don't really teach the children they just teach the subject matter that they have 

356.91 357.91 A: (( yes )) 

357.34 360.99 B: and they haven't engaged the children or the young people 

361.04 367.19 B: the young men and young women who are about to leave there as to what do they want to do exactly 

366.61 368.17 A: sure sure 

367.34 380.72 B: and that that would be the first thing i would say before we teach the kids we ought to as a you know i i know it's corny but we ought to listen to them you know we ought to listen to what they have to say a lot of these kids you know want to rap or something 

378.27 379.32 A: right 

380.57 394.81 B: uh maybe we should introduce some other ideas to them you know maybe rap or whatever the thing that they're seeing and the media's kinda pushed towards them maybe if they saw a successful dentist or whatever you know 

394.80 397.95 B: maybe they would want to be a dentist or something i don't know 

397.38 409.36 A: sure now we have programs like that for our high school in the area plus there are also at the local university and the local college um the like the 

404.54 405.53 B: i see 

409.28 423.01 A: eleventh and twelfth graders and maybe even the younger classes do come and take accelerated courses um we also have a training school where 

411.53 413.33 B: (( right mm )) 

417.50 419.75 B: mm 

423.06 428.73 A: the kids could learn forestry or auto mechanic um 

429.31 438.04 A: things they get to work with the local t._v. stations on how to run the cameras like well like you were you know saying you know 

433.54 434.59 B: i see 

437.74 438.71 B: right 

438.09 446.89 A: um and uh they work hands on in our community with a lot of these businesses 

442.60 444.40 B: mm 

446.92 450.69 A: but the problem is one of the problems is that 

451.07 452.51 A: it people 

452.73 463.71 A: some of the uh people that do work hands on with the kids they they're tired and and yeah they you know they just want to 

459.07 460.08 B: i see [laughter] 

463.76 467.84 A: give it up and in the meantime the kids 

464.73 465.66 B: right 

468.08 469.84 A: are roaming the streets 

469.87 483.29 A: with no direction and going to school and they have no direction because the social workers in the schools are so over loaded that they don't get to the kids to to find out what their aspirations 

472.23 473.08 B: right 

478.28 479.36 B: i see 

483.36 484.63 A: you know are 

483.66 485.05 B: right 

484.71 485.71 A: um 

486.22 496.82 A: it and uh it makes it hurt for the student and i know in my community um there are there are a lot of high school students that can't even read they come into college and 

495.70 497.07 B: (( mm )) 

496.91 498.83 A: you know and um 

498.99 502.04 A: but uh the big emphasis is on 

502.12 504.39 A: uh regent's exams 

503.93 505.02 B: yes 

504.42 513.53 A: now and um they have to pass these regent's exams well if you have a student that's going not going to be good in math but is going to be good 

513.56 527.64 A: as a as a forestry person or an auto mechanic or or who knows maybe even operating a you know a camera for a local television station that regents shouldn't be 

516.04 516.94 B: right 

524.50 525.52 B: i see 

527.81 538.53 A: you know it shouldn't be pushed down the kids' throats and i notice that the kids today that are going coming into colleges are so are under so much stress 

530.38 531.51 B: right 

537.90 539.18 B: right 

538.50 548.49 A: you know to achieve that these kids don't even have time to think about what they want to be or you know or what might interest them them 

544.15 545.14 B: right 

547.63 549.23 B: i see i see 

548.92 552.30 A: and uh you know so 

552.84 555.57 A: uh it it's a 

555.66 557.22 A: just a really 

557.99 561.23 A: you know it it's a very frustrating situation 

560.97 562.48 B: it sounds like it 

561.81 570.41 A: be- because the the uh kids when you're in high school you really need some kind of direction and and like you said you know 

571.03 574.20 A: tell someone what you're interested in 

573.78 574.95 B: right 

574.29 575.86 A: and uh 

575.86 587.69 A: you know there should be and the people from the community that do the things that maybe kids are interested in should be willing to to come in and take time with the students and and uh 

587.66 599.91 A: there are some that do and there then there are some that don't um i think this has to be changed because there are so many kids that are getting discouraged and a lot of them are quitting 

591.60 592.74 B: right
