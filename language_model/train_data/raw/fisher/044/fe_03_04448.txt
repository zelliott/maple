61.10 62.95 B: [lipsmack] cleveland public schools now 

63.24 69.55 B: i don't i don't know what you know about public schools but uh this is fairly typical for big city schools 

69.65 76.54 B: uh there's a thirty six percent graduation rate or maybe thirty five percent no it might be thirty six this year 

76.78 78.37 B: that means um 

79.90 86.33 B: a th- uh of a hundred kids who start the ninth grade only thirty six of 'em finish school 

86.06 88.89 A: god is that just in your school district or 

87.92 92.03 B: no no no that's typical that's sadly that's typical 

89.16 90.73 A: that's nationwide 

91.87 93.31 A: (( oh lord )) 

92.73 96.11 B: and i work in a summer school up here and i work in a in a um 

96.66 99.73 B: in a um high school library in uh 

100.18 103.68 B: [lipsmack] and there's it's a pretty big school it's about two thousand kids 

103.89 116.62 B: and at any time there's like nine hundred freshmen nine hundred ninth graders and sadly most of those kids will not graduate most of those nine hundred won't even finish the ninth grade 

116.10 117.76 A: oh no 

116.95 129.83 B: they don't know how to they just don't know basically how to how to how to learn [laughter] you know i mean they do but i mean learn what i mean i mean they've been turned off from school for a long time [lipsmack] and i guess um 

130.19 136.14 B: i like back to my original statement here i i see i work with a lotta people who are dedicated who really try 

136.30 143.49 B: to get get the kids motivated but it's it's like how can you motivate somebody who doesn't wanna be motivated i mean it's 

143.77 154.59 B: how these are kids who come from homes broken homes and a lotta homes are my my guess is the vast majority of them come from home where the parents didn't had a negative experience 

146.87 148.08 A: uh-huh 

154.98 157.04 B: themselves in school you know they 

157.15 160.24 B: and they they leave it all up to the schools the attitude is 

160.26 161.80 B: you know uh 

160.83 162.94 A: but then they tie your hands too 

162.64 168.95 B: yeah [mn] oh yeah no well the attitude of the parents is uh you know it's your job to educate the kids you know 

169.01 173.24 B: not mine i don't have anything to do with it you know and it doesn't work like that [laughter] 

173.02 179.45 A: i think that most of the problems with the public schools now are the behavioral problems you know but 

179.11 180.40 B: are what 

179.90 182.17 A: the behavioral problems you know 

181.36 191.36 B: oh yeah oh yeah the teachers spend so much time correcting you know the the kids that are uh they well in plain english the assholes yeah 

190.52 191.68 A: uh-huh 

191.46 194.17 B: and yeah but they they can't uh 

194.32 209.19 B: you know they exactly you know that's exactly right you you look at surveys and what what bothers teachers more than anything are uh how much time they have to spend uh on with behavior problems and i mean class- we call it classroom management you're exactly right you know 

209.41 213.89 B: [lipsmack] and so uh what was what specifically is the question here what are we supposed to be uh 

214.01 218.49 A: what's the problems with the schools today the public schools [sigh] 

215.75 217.40 B: oh is it oh is it like the 

217.92 221.61 B: yeah and what 'bout i mean wasn't there something a little more specific than that i forgot 

221.90 227.39 B: something about are they insurmountable or something i what are the pressing problems i don't know 

222.02 223.17 A: um 

227.43 230.80 B: big problems i think when you're only got thirty six 

231.04 232.88 B: out of a hundred kids 

233.36 237.24 B: graduating from high school every every year year after year i mean you know 

237.34 239.35 B: what about those other sixty four 

239.29 240.43 A: uh-huh 

239.60 242.89 B: what are what's happening to those yes it's a huge problem 

242.90 257.77 B: and i'm tired of the politicians and you know people that are are afraid to look squarely at the answer the answer is you know we've got [lipsmack] uh who uh teachers who no matter what they do they get help from home and the you know problems are just gonna 

257.75 260.50 B: keep continue to stay bad i mean 

260.64 269.06 B: i don't have an answer i mean i don't say this is what needs to be done i wish i well yes i do but i don't know how to do it yes more parental involvement i think is 

269.24 270.96 B: who if you ask 

272.17 277.88 B: you know fifty teachers forty five of 'em would tell you that's the biggest issue i i would bet i would bet you 

278.01 292.14 B: i mean i'm just i just went to graduate school a couple of years ago and got my master's in education and that's just a huge issue with urban schools but this is urban schools so we're just i mean you know there's all manners of schools i mean you know you probably live in 

292.24 297.42 B: a dallas suburb where it's uh oh you live in levick okay [laughter] where is levick by the way 

297.37 302.86 A: uh it's it's uh bottom of the panhandle uh you've probably heard of amarillo

305.52 307.13 B: so you're out west huh 

306.97 318.66 A: um yeah kinda it's considered west texas but if you look on the map it looks more like north texas but north texas is like the dallas area it's below the panhandle it's not as high you 

317.35 318.41 B: okay

372.34 382.92 B: i'm very frustrated [lipsmack] i'm very frustrated kids at this time of year they're it's like they come to school with the attitude i'm here only because i have to i don't have to do any 'cause the law tells me i have to be here 

383.83 386.42 B: and what can i mean you know it's 

386.83 395.10 B: you know in a nutshell i think yeah back to the old what's the problem here what's the core problem is you don't get support from home you know 

394.91 396.02 A: uh-huh 

395.34 397.55 B: you don't get support from home i mean 

397.58 408.04 B: i know a good friend of mine is a teacher uh who was sued this girl just lied through her teeth he's i mean the suit will be dismissed but i mean these parents think well we the school's 

408.15 411.39 B: you know maybe we could sue the school district and um 

411.78 417.48 B: [lipsmack] uh they'll settle we could get a hundred thousand dollars outta 'em the guy did absolutely nothing wrong he's most 

417.60 422.80 B: he's absolutely nothing didn't do anything wrong whatsoever this girl lied and her parents just 

422.89 427.80 B: uh you know just took it all the way as far as they could got some lawyer 

427.82 441.89 B: who some greedy lawyer and and they sued the guy and he's not i mean he'll he'll the suit will be dismissed it's just a big headache i mean people think you know uh this is the kind of population where you know sadly the people just are so suspicious of 

441.85 444.76 B: of teachers or what have you i don't know i don't know 

444.05 455.00 A: [lipsmack] i don't know how that got started you know used to the parents were behind the teachers and then now you know the least little thing you know and they're ready for a suit you know 

449.62 451.85 B: i know i know mine were always were 

454.23 455.62 B: i know i know 

455.42 465.62 A: there's a shake up here um there was a teacher that the kid there were a couple of kids that were acting up and she put masking tape over their mouth 

465.85 467.66 A: and um 

467.95 472.00 A: one of the mothers is threatening to sue because um 

472.20 473.33 A: uh 

473.47 474.59 A: it was 

475.52 480.87 A: cruel and unusual punishment and you know her child could've been killed 

478.11 486.77 B: [mn] never mind what the kid did never mind what the kid did to to to prompt the teachers do we forget about that don't we [laughter] [mn] 

482.33 483.55 A: yeah 

485.56 491.46 A: yeah and she said you know it um everybody's criticizing her 

491.38 504.77 A: she said i'm all for you know the teacher teacher investing their best but not to uh put masking tape over 'em you know if the teacher invested their best they really wouldn't have grounds for a suit 

505.08 505.97 B: (( i know )) 

505.61 520.46 A: and supposedly her son had asthma so you know that might precipitate an asthma attack he could've died or something but um you know it's masking tape you know his hands weren't tied you know it couldn't have 

506.00 506.97 B: i know 

519.28 526.02 B: or the kid couldn't have pulled the masking tape off i see [lipsmack] [laughter] oh i know 

521.08 522.40 A: sure 

523.93 525.06 A: and 

526.13 527.90 B: but if they're argu- i know 

526.29 537.89 A: you know it's things like that that i think are destructive to the public schools and then the thing that really aggravates me is you know bush is passing uh pushing for um [lipsmack] a voucher system 

537.49 538.86 B: mhm 

538.33 541.81 A: and some of the private schools are 

541.86 544.06 A: maybe to the public schools 

544.41 552.44 A: like uh the school here has um a high level of national merit scholars 

552.19 553.27 B: mhm 

552.63 559.00 A: but look at the brain banks they're drawing from you know both parents in a lot of cases are physicians you know [mn] 

558.66 561.77 B: oh i know but they just did a study here in um 

561.72 565.38 A: and a lot of the private schools aren't as good as the public schools 

561.79 562.65 B: cleve- 

564.44 569.98 B: oh i know they just did a study here i know this was just released this this week in uh ohio 

570.03 576.24 B: uh that you know the voucher students do not perform better than the public school students 

575.89 576.92 A: uh-huh 

576.48 584.76 B: um 'cause this same problem [laughter] i mean you can't you know you you take a duck outta water i mean you can't make a poor kid do better 

584.48 585.57 A: uh-huh 

584.96 598.13 B: uh if he doesn't get any if he's not gonna his parents don't help i the parents aren't helping any more than they did in public school so it's [noise] not the schools' fault i think it's the parents' fault that's what it tells me uh it's you know 

594.35 595.64 A: uh-huh 

598.14 599.89 B: i guess i the un-
