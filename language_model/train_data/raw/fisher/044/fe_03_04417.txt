263.64 264.51 A: [laughter] 

267.62 272.99 A: yeah me and me and my husband had [laughter] had a gateway it eventually just it crashed 

268.14 269.42 B: [laughter] 

273.04 279.93 A: we lost the har- the hard drive like so many times eventually we decided to get go with another brand 

279.36 284.19 B: like i thought it was um i have american online i thought it was american online but 

283.68 284.63 A: mhm 

285.46 286.99 B: they crash a lot 

287.83 300.97 A: yeah i mean i like their service i mean like i had i have a laptop with them but the desktop that we had it was just after a while just like we just gave up had got tired of reinstalling the whole operating system 

301.43 305.84 B: i i was thinking of going to general because number one it's half the y- you know 

306.32 310.98 B: half the price m- less than half the price and they have the same [noise] thing 

311.50 314.92 A: do they have good service up there in rochester for general 

314.78 317.01 B: (( i guess so i don't know [noise] )) 

318.18 321.32 A: 'cause uh we i mean we had tried them a little bit 

321.39 324.30 A: i'm saying my husband and i we had tried them 

324.84 333.50 A: here in the bronx 'cause this is where i l- i live in the bronx and uh there wasn't too many uh connections here so there wasn't really 

333.53 335.08 A: a great service 

334.82 336.09 B: oh really 

335.51 339.37 A: yeah i tr- we tried net zero too and it was always hard to get 

339.58 343.56 A: on they have more connections in certain places than others so 

343.78 348.10 A: you should maybe do a trial run with them first 

348.25 349.71 A: to see um 

350.08 354.20 A: you know to see if you can get a connection every single time you try to log on 

354.89 359.34 A: if if not then they probably don't have a lot of um connections 

360.32 365.76 A: that's probably why [laughter] a._o._l. is uh you know the monopoly right now and that uh 

366.05 368.57 B: everything is slow on a._o._l. now 

368.20 369.40 A: yeah 

369.55 371.43 B: (( but then because they they )) 

371.79 376.11 B: uh like you say [noise] they crash a lot should tell you my wife was a schoolteacher too 

376.23 377.43 A: oh yeah 

379.00 385.63 A: so i don't i don't i'm kind of hesitant of going into the public school system i work with a non profit right now 

385.88 390.33 B: well she worked in a special division they call them m._o. hospital teachers 

385.98 386.75 A: bu- 

389.96 390.82 A: yeah 

390.84 397.73 B: and she did very you know they're salaried just like a teacher only they're going to individual homes and and the jails and the prisons 

397.71 399.58 A: mhm 

398.19 399.60 B: the hospitals 

399.92 403.75 B: for individuals they work with the kids that get suspended and uh they 

405.06 406.92 A: does she like doing that 

406.33 409.11 B: yeah she did 

409.87 415.42 B: 'cause it's a one and one and you didn't have to deal with a classroom although now they're going to switch over to um 

416.27 418.91 B: (( um classrooms )) 

418.89 419.96 A: yeah 

419.83 422.03 B: to save money and 

423.09 428.00 B: it's in where we are they're trying not to suspend the kids as much either 

428.95 430.89 A: yeah 

431.49 432.11 B: [cough] 

432.58 436.14 A: which one which or which do think works better 

436.15 437.70 A: or what does she think 

438.05 445.68 B: well i'd say a smaller classroom you know some teachers uh they like it better uh you know one on one 

440.62 441.58 A: yeah 

447.66 451.56 B: but then you get usually gets a lot of special ed kids 

450.88 452.26 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

451.98 459.93 B: they have art teachers too or some of her friends are art teachers [noise] that teach in the system they teach one on one also 

460.32 462.13 B: one has a class 

463.75 467.11 B: depends where you are if you're in the jail [noise] 

468.27 472.21 B: because they do have a classroom situation too 

472.17 473.15 A: right 

472.92 475.10 B: but the main office has 

476.60 481.43 B: children in a class but they're usually the ones that are really hard to handle 

482.80 490.62 A: yeah that's kind of difficult and [sigh] uh the school system is not really [laughter] you know trying to solve the problem 

490.83 493.07 A: either you know but 

493.54 498.75 A: definitely probably the smaller size with you know people experienced working with them 

499.56 501.01 A: could definitely help 

500.89 505.44 B: but yeah well you have more one on one too with the parents because you go into their homes 

505.04 508.06 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

508.84 512.69 A: but now they [laughter] they you know particularly in the city they they're 

513.35 521.31 A: talking about cutting out all those extra helpers and things like that and make it even more difficult for 

520.56 527.18 B: and they did here they here they cut out the psychologists and counsellors too but now they're trying to get them back now 

527.74 531.17 B: governor for taxes has vetoed everything that uh 

533.13 537.23 A: how bad is how many you know do they make a lot of cuts up there too i mean 

536.83 544.36 B: well they yeah they well first of all they were going to lay off uh a whole lot of teachers [noise] and then the legislator allotted money 

544.56 548.56 B: what i don't understand is they approved a quick ferry over here 

548.27 549.42 A: mhm 

549.22 557.58 B: and then and then the the teaching came last but now now now it's hung up again because of um uh 

558.63 561.80 B: governor for taxes reviewing what the legislator 

561.90 564.70 B: did so now they have to override him so 

568.27 570.19 B: it's up in the air here 

571.22 572.34 A: gosh 

572.38 574.72 A: (( a lot of people but i mean i don't know )) 

574.79 582.32 A: how the work situation is up there i mean have a lot of people been laid off too i mean just they always just keeping talking about the city 

582.33 588.32 B: well you you heard about it up here right they got rid of the um superintendent 

582.43 583.27 A: in 

587.85 589.36 A: yeah 

588.80 594.78 B: 'cause he had spent well number one four million dollars in travelling expenses 

594.92 598.12 B: in two years [laughter] 

597.53 599.89 A: (( oh gosh [laughter] )) 

598.61 599.52 B: (( [laughter] a- ))
