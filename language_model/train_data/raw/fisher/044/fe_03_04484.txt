0.16 2.12 A: hello this is mike 

1.63 4.66 B: hello mike this is audrey grant how are you 

4.00 8.23 A: hi i'm fine audrey hi this sounds like a real interesting top- topic again 

8.38 15.93 B: yeah [laughter] okay um how can we make the school system better 

8.94 9.87 A: [laughter] 

15.76 25.75 A: right it sounds to me like that uh i guess it depends some on where you live i'm sure different school districts are are different but from what i can see i live in virginia 

25.55 26.50 B: yes 

25.73 30.91 A: and from we can se- i can see here we live in a in a kind of a heavily populated 

30.83 39.04 A: fast growing metropolitan area and and the school systems are not bad but the thing and some of the big problems i see is is with the problem of having uh 

38.93 49.11 A: just overcrowding and and a general situation like where [cough] where we don't have enough you know classrooms or or too big a size of students and stuff like that 

49.65 50.78 B: okay 

50.96 52.84 B: that's okay 

52.90 56.25 B: i can see what you're your point 

56.01 57.01 A: mhm 

56.39 58.16 B: um but to 

58.17 69.04 B: uh make it better i can go all the way back i'm from i'm not that old but i would like to go all the way back 

59.71 60.64 A: mhm 

62.60 63.50 A: mhm 

65.11 66.18 A: [laughter] 

68.64 69.68 A: mhm 

69.06 78.63 B: and i know that that is impossible but um the over crowdedness um i can see 

78.75 86.89 B: that there can be a problem but it has to do like the buddy system i feel as though that 

87.00 90.20 B: it's a lot that has to do with 

91.37 104.32 B: i go i go a way back where it has to go wi- you know saying the pledge allegiance to the flag you know and i'm not all that like to say okay quote unquote american you know like you know i'm 

95.64 96.67 A: mhm 

97.05 97.80 A: right 

104.38 107.71 B: if anything happened i have to put up american flag but 

107.72 109.20 B: it's like 

109.25 113.77 B: i believe that the whole thing stems from 

114.54 115.90 B: having the book 

116.07 117.42 B: reading a book 

116.22 118.03 A: (( mm mhm [laughter] mhm )) 

118.17 122.60 B: taking it back where there is respect 

122.69 123.46 A: right 

122.89 126.50 B: i see no respect in the classroom 

126.54 127.29 A: mhm 

126.69 131.08 B: there is less respect for the youth today 

130.84 131.88 A: mhm 

131.25 136.41 B: their morals are at like you know it just seems as though that 

137.26 141.63 B: you i can't say that it always has to do with the television 

141.69 155.54 B: or any or but it just seems like even um the adults you know are um playing a big role in the part of all of this as well with the students and their own children 

147.00 147.84 A: right 

153.10 154.09 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

155.57 164.18 B: so i mean i also see that it can also stop you know or help let's take it back you know 

164.20 172.79 B: to the beginning you know and the word you know i know that they're like what is the word you know they don't want to believe but you do see that 

165.27 166.13 A: mhm 

172.47 173.37 A: right 

172.81 178.49 B: a lot of the young folk today are trying to find that you know um 

175.09 175.94 A: mhm 

178.52 179.43 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

178.72 182.60 B: especially where i live and the congregation that i go to 

182.47 183.31 A: mhm 

182.63 186.64 B: and they are crying out you know they want help 

186.19 188.55 A: they want values and things yeah 

187.18 189.41 B: yes they do 

189.62 193.08 A: yeah i think so too [cough] and i think that is 

190.89 192.15 B: yes 

193.11 205.26 A: probably something that's kinda what's different from when i was in school like you said the pledge allegiance and even having the ten commandments sort of there was things like that that wasn't looked down on like it is now and it definitely makes some difference i think in 

205.84 218.20 A: in just what they accept as far as discipline and what and like you said i ha- i agree with you i do think that with children i can see there's a lot more disrespect in the way they talk and the language they use is is different than when i was growing up 

217.99 221.06 B: yes i mean i don't want to take it like on a sad note 

220.81 221.70 A: right 

221.04 229.29 B: you know but i i think that you know we it should be some type of a test you know it's not to say i'm no 

226.79 227.75 A: mhm 

229.17 237.07 B: it just uh i mean maybe you know maybe i'm tak- going off the subject but i would just like it to go to let's just try it 

236.44 237.44 A: mhm 

237.39 242.96 B: you know i know and then maybe that would um the over crowdedness 

242.80 248.28 B: and um it would be so more so where you can sit next to someone 

248.10 258.70 B: you know and if your foot you know happens to touch someone else it's like oh okay man all right that's fine man just watch your foot you know something like 

252.20 253.00 A: right 

257.33 260.67 A: yeah i think what i what i was thinking about is this though is is 

260.69 274.37 A: just the fact that [mn] we probably 'cause of our values and what we're people are willing to pay money for and not that anybody you know feels like they're not taxed enough but it i just think we need to put more of our priorities of our society and our 

274.33 277.13 A: nation towards the education and and just 

277.14 282.72 A: like in areas where [cough] there's i guess there are the areas where the population's dropping off and every schools aren't 

282.66 293.82 A: as crowded but to me when you put when you put thirty something students there are more into a classroom and expect a teacher to give them in- you know they can't give them an individualized time 

293.89 304.49 A: and you also have the situation where in some cases that the ones that are a little bit slower kinda fall in the in the cracks and then don't get what they need i just think that type of situation could be helped by 

304.62 313.95 A: spending a bigger portion of our money and and i and i guess the other quarter goes with it when i say all the grants there's also getting good teachers 'cause i from seeing my kids go through 

313.94 323.93 A: high school and junior high especially and stuff they had some really excellent great teachers but to me there's there is too big a percentage of teachers that are just kinda 

324.45 338.10 A: dead wood laying there [cough] not really not good teachers don't care about whether the kids learn and and they kinda just work to contract and and they got low salaries maybe but they also don't perform and i just think that's a real 

337.87 342.16 A: that's another problem i think that has to be addressed in the public schools yeah right 

341.28 342.30 B: okay 

342.33 343.50 B: i follow you 

343.66 344.83 B: okay 

344.89 346.37 B: all right um 

346.44 353.23 B: and and education and being educated as well um even even where i stand um 

353.28 354.55 B: in my 

354.68 358.62 B: uh group or where i where i work at community for learning 

358.39 359.35 A: mhm 

358.71 365.21 B: um we have implementers they go out and they help to implement 

362.26 363.20 A: mhm 

364.92 365.86 A: mhm 

365.23 371.10 B: the class rooms and they the work with the facilitators the principals 

370.82 371.71 A: right 

371.11 374.12 B: and um they work with the children but 

374.16 378.97 B: um i can see where you're saying that even though with 

379.05 382.87 B: i can see the difference in the implementing 

382.58 383.56 A: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

383.01 385.24 B: the implementers they 

385.56 389.03 B: when i first came okay we had a better 

389.11 390.05 B: um 

390.31 393.30 B: better teachers better implementers 

393.35 394.70 B: now 

394.80 397.91 B: i can see where they're 

398.32 407.81 B: the ones that they're sending out and by our director when when i can attend a meeting and i can see how much they 

406.69 409.54 A: (( mm )) 

407.89 418.71 B: are putting out towards the class and helping the- to to implement and to set the structure straight i can see that they themselves 

418.65 424.42 B: um are just just not as well educated for 

425.72 438.28 B: helping the students so i can see that too um you know even that has to do with it as well i i i do i do believe you there and we have a very excellent um 

439.08 446.66 B: um c._s._l. director right now and um she is working hard with giving them the 

441.69 442.60 A: (( mhm [cough] )) 

446.71 449.42 B: skills and the tools that they need 

447.54 448.36 A: right 

449.23 455.60 B: and making them and making them work higher and um and i can see that 

455.42 465.28 B: you know there are a couple that resent because of the fact that they're they're so much into themselves were trying to um further maybe 

465.90 467.75 B: the psych self 

467.35 468.23 A: mhm 

467.91 474.81 B: and they worry about self and really it doesn't seem as though that they're worrying too much about 

475.14 478.96 B: the children you know just yes 

476.44 477.16 A: right 

477.38 478.45 A: (( right right )) 

478.48 482.18 A: and i think that's why i mean mean i mean i really respect 

482.25 486.98 A: teachers and special and and i think and i when when i said before i was i didn't 

486.85 496.45 A: want to indicate i i think my bo- both my parents were school teachers and and i have a sister that's a school teacher in a public school in oklahoma and just you know and i see it 

496.44 502.54 A: and i've also seen ones that and these are the ones that my daughter at her high school and my sons went there too 

502.45 513.22 A: that are just excellent and they loved what they do and they work hard and they they do a lot of stuff extra stuff to try to make it a great learning experience 

513.08 525.51 A: but i also know i've had math teachers and difference the different ones that my kids have had that they really don't care you know and you and you go up and have a meeting with them and it it's just obvious that they're just kinda working to contract and they're 

519.52 520.53 B: yeah 

526.15 535.66 A: and they don't care whether kids learn anything or pick up anything and the and the the kids know it too i think when you think of that i know my daughter and and hearing my sons saying they know which teachers 

531.29 531.95 B: (( mm )) 

535.23 536.24 B: yes 

535.65 541.31 A: and are good and they know which ones really care and that love to do it and they also know the ones that are just 

538.35 539.27 B: yes 

541.18 543.29 A: kinda dead wood living there 

542.72 543.52 B: yes 

543.06 557.00 A: [mn] and i think that the thing i'm saying that that i guess what some of the thing we talk on how to fix these things and they would have to do something to to to generally upgrade the pay scale so you can get a higher caliber person to want to do it plus 

556.91 570.26 A: do some kind of reward system so you're really rewarding the teachers to keep 'em there and the ones that aren't good teachers i know that the teachers unions and different things are strong and fight against it but but if a person just really isn't a good teacher 

560.13 561.03 B: right 

561.56 562.48 B: right 

570.30 574.64 A: and it doesn't have any heart into it there oughta to be some way to 

574.73 585.72 A: you know for that to come to light and for something to be done about it 'cause because i guess what i'm saying [laughter] really as a whole we just got our values completely wrong in this country we will pay 

577.78 578.91 B: right 

586.03 597.92 A: you know millions of dollars for people to be movie stars and rock stars and stuff and yet when it comes to yeah [laughter] and when it you know when it comes to state of pay you know for a sch- education the kids a lot of times we don't 

590.52 593.10 B: what is that about [laughter] 

597.59 598.32 B: oh 

597.94 599.54 A: and it bothers me 

599.00 599.89 B: yes
