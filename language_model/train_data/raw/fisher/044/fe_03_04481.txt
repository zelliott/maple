4.57 5.60 B: hi mike 

5.30 6.80 A: (( how you doing )) 

6.23 7.89 B: okay how are you today 

7.25 9.02 A: oh pretty good here 

8.44 9.94 B: where are you located 

9.35 11.65 A: i'm in uh richmond virginia 

11.09 13.46 B: ah i'm in seattle washington 

12.81 16.02 A: are you well we're all across the country from each other [laughter] 

14.51 19.28 B: yeah i have real good friends down in the hampton roads area not too far from richmond ah 

17.43 18.44 A: yeah 

18.96 26.47 A: yeah yeah we're that that don't live too far from the area and we lived down there for a few years so i guess they wanted us to talk about the public schools 

25.56 31.70 B: the public schools yeah wha- what do you think are they in as big a mess in virginia as they are in washington state 

27.21 28.24 A: yeah 

29.08 30.18 A: [laughter] 

31.35 38.66 A: well they they're not that terrible i don't think but there are lots i think i do feel that there's lots of problems and a lot of things that 

38.67 41.29 A: could be done hopefully to improve them 

40.74 44.22 B: yeah i um i'm actually a former public high school teacher 

43.76 44.91 A: mhm 

44.28 47.53 B: so i have very strong opinions on this [laughter] 

46.21 52.24 A: yeah see yeah if you've been a teacher then you probably have seen a lot more than i have first hand i i've just had my 

52.30 58.93 A: children go through the school system and [mn] they've been in a couple of different school systems 'cause we moved around some early in my career but 

59.01 66.76 A: here in the richmond area we live in a suburban area and we have fairly good schools but there is overcrowding and there's probably too big a 

66.55 72.34 A: uh a you know te- too many students for some of the teachers in some of the different classes and 

71.74 72.68 B: yeah 

72.19 85.71 A: and there's definitely some other i think there's some cases where there is kind of how's the best way to say it th- i mean i know from my kids we they have some really good teachers that really put a lot of interest and there are some that are to me are just kinda working to contract and 

85.67 89.64 A: not really putting a lot of effort into it that could be you know the reason 

87.31 99.81 B: yeah that that's that was my experience there were always a few good ones a few dedicated ones i counted myself among those and then there was what i call dead wood and and two and two particular uh 

94.14 95.19 A: right 

96.67 97.57 A: right 

99.83 103.64 B: spring to mind one a very nice guy the other a not very nice woman 

103.35 104.24 A: mhm 

103.54 108.28 B: both of whom said oh i'd get out of here but what would i do i don't know how to do anything 

107.75 108.94 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

108.13 122.66 B: and my thinking was well if that's the case then you shouldn't be teaching in a classroom and both you know going into teaching right out of college had never done anything else i didn't become a teacher till i'd been out in the business world for about ten years i did it by choice 

113.05 114.09 A: right 

120.85 121.73 A: right 

122.55 126.26 B: and the thing is in the mid eighties when i started teaching 

126.53 137.40 B: ah i remember writing an essay for graduate school enumerating the problems with the public school system and how to address them and the issues are the same twenty years later i mean they really are 

137.13 138.13 A: (( mhm yeah is that right )) 

137.31 150.92 B: and i think you hit the nail on the head certainly here in washington state which has had a lot of growth in the seattle area in the last ten years class size is the biggest thing the number of kids per class every research project over the last fifty years has shown 

140.31 141.32 A: mhm 

146.44 147.00 A: (( [cough] )) 

150.86 162.96 B: the more individualized attention a student gets whether they're in kindergarten or first grade or eleventh or twelfth grade the better they do the better the teachers do the better the school does and unfortunately that costs money and 

160.22 161.06 A: right 

162.19 163.56 A: yeah 

162.95 165.39 B: you know people just aren't willing 

165.37 180.03 B: to uh i mean i've seen it uh trying to get school levies passed here in seattle just for things like fixing roofs and getting broken windows fixed much less hire teachers is just a real hard thing and then the no new taxes no new taxes 

167.73 168.69 A: mhm 

173.38 174.24 A: right 

175.61 176.39 A: right 

179.77 180.36 A: (( [mn] )) 

179.93 192.30 B: george bush tax cuts america of two thousand three people particularly if like if their kids have already been through school they're just not willing to pay higher property taxes and it's it's a shame 'cause i don't see 

181.68 182.46 A: right 

184.40 185.11 A: right 

189.63 191.09 A: yeah yeah 

192.64 202.01 B: how uh whether it's a rich district or a poor one how you can you know alleviate all of the problems without putting few kids in each classroom uh-huh 

195.78 196.34 A: (( [cough] )) 

201.33 209.95 A: right and that and i think that's definitely to me one of the big things because we're in a real fast growing part of the kind of the southwestern 

210.74 220.19 A: [sigh] you know far suburbs of the thing and there are just you know subdivisions going up everywhere and the and the high school that my children [mn] now go well my final daughter's going through 

220.25 229.68 A: school now and stuff is just way overcrowded 'cause i mean they they and they have a lot of facilities problems that need to be fixed up and and they're and they're talking about building another high school to 

229.51 237.63 A: which will help a lot of them take some of these overcrowding and get them there but it but your right it costs that those costs i mean a lot of people do resist the 

238.00 247.99 A: you know the increase to their property value or to other additional taxes so i do i do think that's one thing that we need to do and then i think also do something with with 

248.05 262.89 A: you know some way to weed out people that really aren't good at teaching and they're just kinda just sitting there soaking you know just doing their time but not really teaching anything and the kids hate to be in their classes but for the most part nothing seems to be done about that that i can feel 

254.51 256.91 B: yeah just doing their time yep yep 

261.64 272.01 B: yeah i've always been an advocate maybe not so much with the elementary level though to a certain extent i think it'd be a good idea but definitely with junior high and high school kids i've always said the kids should have a voice 

271.74 272.83 A: mhm 

271.87 279.92 B: it's not it's not uh by accident that as you say the kids recognize immediately who the dead wood is and who the good ones are 

278.68 279.53 A: right 

279.84 281.12 B: and often 

280.97 291.82 B: like in my case my first teaching job i was fired after two years because they didn't pass the school levy and they cut twenty per cent of faculty and it's it's last in first out it was not on merit at all i was the 

287.83 288.75 A: (( seriously )) 

290.40 291.22 A: (( right [cough] )) 

291.75 305.48 B: first new hire in the high school english department i taught at in twelve years and the fi- first new member of the faculty in six it was a small district and the only reason i'd gotten hired is a guy had had died i mean that's why there was an opening 

294.72 295.56 A: mhm 

299.77 300.80 A: right 

305.13 306.12 A: right 

305.52 310.05 B: and um you know the kids immediately uh 

310.42 320.27 B: told me you know not not 'cause i'd asked but you you became aware right away who the good teachers were and who the dead wood was and luckily uh in only two years there i got 

313.08 313.99 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

320.38 332.57 B: uh a reputation as a very good though tough teacher and that helped me in finding another job because i used for my references not just former supervisors not just former colleagues but former students 

332.23 333.11 A: (( mhm right )) 

332.53 335.90 B: and i think it would be great i don't know that it'll ever happen 

335.81 340.41 B: but if they do go to a merit only system if the teachers' unions who 

339.97 341.05 A: (( mhm right )) 

340.23 353.56 B: i have a very low opinion of ever allow it they should poll the kids and the kids will tell you honestly the bad students and the good students will say this person ought to be out of here they hate teaching they make life miserable for everybody 

344.72 345.44 A: right 

351.44 352.19 A: right 

353.44 354.37 A: (( right [cough] )) 

353.78 355.20 B: and uh 

355.14 366.11 B: you know what you were saying about the gross up where you are there's a town just north of seattle uh called mokochio which i investigated teaching when i moved out here about nine years ago because i knew they were growing so 

357.88 358.71 A: mhm 

361.05 361.78 A: right 

366.05 376.12 B: and they had let's see six years ago had built a brand new high school brand new junior high and brand new elementary school pretty small town like fifteen twenty thousand people small suburb 

373.82 374.55 A: right 

376.31 381.15 B: all of those schools five years after being built had portable classrooms behind them 

381.14 381.96 A: (( right yeah )) 

381.27 391.74 B: they couldn't even plan for the growth and of course most of the people moving in they don't want to pay extra taxes to build yet another school it's a real 

384.41 385.15 A: yeah 

388.26 389.24 A: (( yeah mm )) 

389.95 393.67 A: yeah yeah that that is a big battle i think and 

392.86 395.04 B: it's a real battle yeah mhm 

394.35 398.65 A: and and you're right tha- tha- that i think almost almost every high school 

398.81 404.02 A: and middle school in this part of the uh city have the mobile 

404.36 408.06 A: units you know out because they're just there are just too many 

407.56 408.80 B: yeah 

408.32 419.84 A: it's uh and i think there they there's some plans for that but it's you know i can't remember how many hundred million dollars and like when they try to do bonds and such it just doesn't get they don't always pass sometimes they do 

409.60 410.61 B: and it's 

419.59 426.05 B: yeah and meanwhile i think there's a deep systemic or societal cause and that's we're willing to pay 

423.47 424.41 A: (( mhm )) 

425.94 436.05 B: movie actors twenty million dollars for a movie or rock and roll singers a hundred bucks a ticket to sing for an hour and a half but teachers' salaries continue to be you know 

428.32 428.95 A: (( [mn] [cough] )) 

432.49 433.28 A: right 

435.23 437.48 A: the lowest yeah 

436.62 443.43 B: just just terribly low and if you're going to encourage professionalism in the teaching ranks and good preparation 

443.42 451.76 B: you've just you've gotta put it at least i mean i knew engineers who came out of college when i got out of college who were making six or seven times what teachers were 

443.96 444.84 A: right 

448.93 450.13 A: mhm 

451.59 452.41 A: right 

451.74 457.66 B: and anybody who goes to grad school whether they become an accountant or a doctor or a lawyer or an advanced engineer 

457.44 458.24 A: right 

457.45 472.00 B: they're gonna make five or six times the average teachers' salary if they're good and so as a result you've gotta have the people who you know will do it for the love of it and as long as the good teachers stay in there for thirty years making next to nothing 

460.50 461.44 A: right 

461.52 462.54 A: yeah 

471.80 473.02 A: right 

472.49 485.63 B: you know everybody in society says oh that's so wonderful you do that but meanwhile our our priorities in society are pretty skewed when i think the average teachers' salary nationally now is thirty two or three thousand dollars 

485.13 486.15 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

485.53 488.34 B: it's slightly under forty out here 

488.35 501.04 B: but they're laying off teachers the seattle public school district and several of the suburban districts are all laying teachers off because they have this huge budget crunch partly because of the economy in general and state money coming to the districts is low 

500.30 501.75 A: (( right [cough] )) 

501.16 503.09 B: and partly because they've had this 

503.24 513.38 B: this influx of growth but not an influx of of er of income for the districts and so what do they do they got more kids and they're firing teachers you figure it out i can't 

507.58 508.44 A: right 

510.84 511.66 A: yeah 

512.35 521.31 A: yeah it don't make sense but i do i think you hit a real a real great point to go with the others is [cough] is the salary stuff 'cause i mean i 

521.32 526.27 A: i went through school and you know and basically i mean i both my parents 

526.09 535.91 A: were public school teachers my dad coached and yes and my dad farmed and did other you know did a bunch of stuff so he could feed we have five kids in our family but and i think that i would have liked 

527.07 528.20 B: oh is that right okay 

535.85 544.91 A: being in the in a teaching profession or even at the university level possibly but but you know you just look at the things and i went into the information technology field and my salary 

544.80 554.88 A: you know is considerably higher than it would have been if i had taught but i think i would have been a very good field that i would probably like to do it even do some coaching and things like that because i think it's really a 

555.06 566.74 A: but when you kinda see what your parents and both have to work and all this stuff you go through to do what you you know people do choose other fields and i do think that if they could come up with a with a 

566.82 577.68 A: [cough] really incentive based way to pay and when people get their education and are excellent at the that would definitely be so much better because when you think about it our values are really skewed you're 

577.62 583.42 A: a hundred per cent correct i mean we people will pay all this money for sports and other types of things and 

583.56 589.76 B: right exactly yeah yeah that's a great example here in seattle we built a brand new ba- baseball park a brand new football stadium 

583.74 585.38 A: (( you know for and they will )) 

589.26 590.36 A: right 

589.79 593.36 B: and the cost of those two uh 

593.69 599.89 B: easily could have built brand new high schools throughout the area and staffed 

597.03 597.87 A: right
