0.00 1.42 B: [noise] hello 

1.30 3.43 A: hi there how ya doing 

2.09 6.30 B: [cough] how ya doing what's your what's your name 

3.75 5.41 A: [laughter] 

5.63 6.55 A: robert 

6.60 7.88 B: mine's mitch 

7.72 11.05 A: mitch okay looks like we've got a tough topic here [laughter] 

10.30 15.09 B: yeah well do i think something's wrong yes i do do you 

12.46 13.94 A: what do ya think 

15.63 20.27 A: uh yeah but it's not wholly wrong w. h. o. l. l. y. you know 

19.63 20.88 B: mhm 

21.56 29.60 A: [laughter] but anyway uh i don't know uh we keep pouring taxes tax money into the public schools and um 

27.16 31.56 B: (( [laughter] )) 

29.81 32.66 A: i'm not so sure that the uh 

32.79 40.53 A: the private schools which uh usually face these things are the necessary answer what do you think 

40.58 48.05 B: well i think if you keep on pouring taxes in that they're doing no good i think that they have to come up with another way to get the money for schools 

48.03 52.78 B: and um i think the problems with the schools a lot of the problems are 

52.69 56.99 B: not necessarily the schools it's the the the parents of the 

56.89 63.82 B: children are not getting involved with the schools or or you don't h- they're not getting involved with their kids 

60.13 61.77 A: oh that's true yeah 

63.71 64.43 A: yeah 

63.72 78.19 B: and schools pass children no matter it's i heard that it's up it's not up to the schools to pass the children it's the parents they get asked do you want your son or daughter promoted or left back and that's 

77.18 81.70 A: yeah other- otherwise they just get attendance performance that sort of um too you know 

80.11 90.24 B: exactly you know and that's ridiculous who wants their son or daughter to be left back if they need to be left back they should be left back who is going to decide that the parent or the teacher 

89.86 98.01 A: yeah i think that if if uh parents uh uh want to have their kids attend other than private school 

90.25 91.21 B: i mean 

98.02 107.23 A: uh if they can afford it it's a great thing you know so it leaves the public school with less money so i don't know how we're going to get around that you know 

106.70 108.35 B: yeah i don't know either 

108.05 115.19 A: they they waste a lot of money but i i don't know there's people that have other interests in school programs like i'm 

115.43 121.56 A: you know i think sports should continue and that sort of thing and i'm certainly uh uh 

121.58 134.99 A: glad to know that there's much as many int- uh many sports that the girls the females can get involved in uh i don't think they should be cut out you know although i don't have any kids in school right now 

134.31 136.91 B: (( mhm and )) 

135.41 136.12 A: that's 

136.41 142.42 A: that's some of the things that uh local administrators should be able to um to handle and um 

142.67 147.13 A: they seem to keep on wanting to get teacher pay raises you know well 

147.27 151.13 A: that's great but i mean when's it gonna stop you know 

151.67 160.85 B: i think the teachers deserve pay raises in a lot of times but a lot of times they don't because if the kids are so bad maybe the teachers need to be uh 

160.77 161.88 A: yeah 

161.77 169.34 B: put on not necessarily trial but brought up to snuff you know maybe they shouldn't be passed so easily in their college classes or whatever 

168.97 170.83 A: well there should be some 

170.98 176.60 A: some kinda system to evaluate the teacher the teacher 

176.24 177.58 B: mhm 

176.66 187.46 A: as to whether they would merit uh uh an increase in wage and currently in public schools in most every state i think i'm in washington state 

187.55 188.76 A: and um 

188.72 199.10 A: they all make the same damn money uh amount of money if if they all started to work at the same time you know i got twenty years in you've twenty years in we make both the same 

198.97 207.62 A: well somewhere along the line there's one teacher that's better than another teacher and the better teacher should be rewarded but 

201.79 207.57 B: mhm 

207.53 215.14 A: you can't overpay them when the when the less successful teacher is just kinda hanging on the payroll you know 

214.57 222.09 B: exactly 'cause you know they might be bottom of the barrel you know [laughter] but just because you're a teacher doesn't mean you're a good one 

219.19 220.43 A: yeah yeah yeah 

222.25 229.69 A: and and i and i know there's there's school districts uh where the the tax basis is richer and uh 

229.83 237.25 A: that works out okay for the rich ones but we still have to take care of the to the low ballers the low [mn] 

237.25 247.59 A: the low end of the thing otherwise they just wind up dropping out and then they either become uh i'm not saying uh they're not the most successful 

238.10 239.34 B: oh sure 

245.38 245.94 B: (( [mn] )) 

247.30 256.66 B: (( mhm )) 

247.62 258.26 A: uh but they drop off and become uh a liability of society you know and that's a big general statement but i i'd rather 

258.55 265.26 A: pay 'em to keep 'em in school i mean pay a teacher to keep 'em in school than have 'em drop out and turning into criminals and stuff like that you know 

262.80 263.84 B: sure 

265.54 268.41 A: i don't know what the answer is i really don't 

267.53 277.38 B: well i think i think they need i guess you have to really the only thing you can do is tax people but how how else do people get money for things you know but who do you tax 

277.60 278.32 A: yeah 

277.62 289.35 B: well i think maybe you know everybody is just all the tax smokers again you know but you know smokers i used to be a smoker i haven't been a smoker in years but you know how much more can you charge somebody for a packet of cigarettes 

289.24 291.21 A: oh oh yeah [laughter] 

289.25 296.77 B: maybe they need to you know maybe they need to put some more taxes on people who drink alcohol or people who you know 

296.18 300.54 A: well i i wouldn't [laughter] i wouldn't go that far [laughter] 

297.64 298.87 B: i don't know 

299.05 306.30 B: well [mn] i don't know or or nobody wants to pay more to the d. m. v. nobody wants to pay more you know 

306.28 307.56 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

306.30 315.48 B: so where do you put it you know ten cents here or ten cents there well maybe they put some more taxes on library books or something but um 

314.31 316.12 A: (( yeah that could be [laughter] )) 

315.99 323.97 B: there's gotta you know be a way to get that money i mean they said the lottery was the answer they get all that money from the lotteries and they're saying where did all that money go to 

321.32 322.59 A: oh that 

323.35 326.11 A: yeah you can't even track it you don't know where it goes 

324.52 338.27 B: 'cause i'm in california you know los angeles and we have a lottery out here and you know they said they make h- how many billions of dollars for the schools but then they're saying showing bad reports all the time of what's going wrong in the schools you know like 

327.90 328.86 A: wow 

329.55 330.28 A: yeah 

338.28 346.02 B: the bad things how they're unsanitary and always broken and you know special reports and you know and all this kinda stuff and then you wonder 

341.87 343.18 A: [laughter] 

343.32 344.15 A: yeah 

345.98 355.86 B: you know everybody gets lottery fever you know and they spend all that money and they're supposed to give a certain percent to the schools but where really is it going i don't know 

350.06 351.10 A: oh yeah 

354.67 360.96 A: you you can't you can't trace it the legislature never shows what they do the money just goes into a great big pot 

358.70 359.70 B: no 

359.90 364.76 B: you just kinda say okay and you believe it 'cause what else can you do about it 

364.69 365.49 A: yeah 

364.81 368.52 B: but um you know there's there's gotta be 

368.73 370.46 B: [cough] something gotta be done 'cause 

369.17 380.53 A: yeah i i i don't know i don't know the answer but i i know this that if if we're we're to increase money grants to the private schools 

380.61 390.45 A: uh i think it would just enhance them that much more and i don't know if uh financially and i don't know if it would do any do any better it seems to me that the 

390.44 396.88 A: the superior students uh drift over into the uh to the private school you know 

396.96 409.19 A: and i'm not saying that's bad but you're gonna leave behind a whole bunch of kids that are gonna turn into misfits and nothings in the public schools if you don't do something to straighten 'em up you know 

404.35 405.91 B: mhm 

408.89 414.15 B: 'cause i know my um my brother and my sister and brother in law have a

415.08 421.46 B: nine year old no excuse me twelve year old and um they're looking to move way up north 

421.33 430.50 B: to go to a better school district just because it's so poor down here you know it's so bad and my brother in law's a teacher [laughter]

447.58 460.65 A: six and three and maybe four and then two years ago only one high school student graduated because the the base is just not there and the teach- student teacher ratio is something like 

455.42 456.55 B: wow 

460.63 468.14 A: i don't know sixteen to one you know and hell you can get a lot of information packed into a kid with with a low ratio like that you know
