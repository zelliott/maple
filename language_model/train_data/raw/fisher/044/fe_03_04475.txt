0.55 2.16 B: (( hello )) 

0.60 1.79 A: (( hello )) 

2.19 4.85 A: hi i'm thelma 

4.17 6.84 B: thelma my name is lewis how are you today 

6.01 8.93 A: lewis good thank you how are you 

8.45 10.20 B: i'm doing fine thank you 

9.90 11.10 A: great 

10.60 12.38 B: so that was thelma again 

12.38 13.92 A: that's right 

13.31 14.23 B: okay 

14.48 18.60 B: so what do you think about the current situation with the school system thelma 

18.92 32.00 A: well i think that uh somehow children have to be like helped um they're not getting enough support from their parents um 

32.69 44.46 A: you know the parents are working and the kids they go out to school and the parents do their thing and there's not enough connection there and 

44.83 48.70 A: i think some of the kids are living in such 

48.94 63.60 A: poverty situations or other problems like uh maybe there's alcoholism in the family um different problems whatever they may be like that that are really serious 

63.57 65.41 A: and uh 

65.65 69.97 A: they they need more counselling i guess is what it is 

69.95 84.76 A: and we have to have outreach things where um like the food programs um that are somehow the the well to some extent that is done where uh the 

84.74 93.27 A: social worker at a school will recommend where children and their families could go for food for meals 

93.55 103.81 A: um but there isn't enough counselling and social services connected with the schools and if necessary for kids to learn 

103.44 104.45 B: (( uh-huh i )) 

104.49 116.06 B: i have to pretty much agree with what you're saying that i perhaps would take it even a step further and i think we both agree that it has a lot to do with the family environment 

115.57 117.12 A: right 

116.24 129.42 B: but i'm going to take a step further because not only are there poverty situations but even where wh- when you have the environment where there isn't a po- po- whereas poverty does not exist 

129.55 133.38 B: uh parents they just don't want to take the time to 

132.69 133.77 A: yeah 

133.68 137.46 B: raise the kids and they want the teachers at the schools to do that 

137.71 140.28 A: well you know somebody's gotta do it 

140.33 141.43 B: (( uh-huh )) 

141.53 148.80 B: so it makes it very difficult on the teachers to try and raise a child and teach the child all at the same time 

148.15 155.37 A: exactly that's right but i think that if if we had more counselling available 

155.31 168.18 A: and places for uh children to ask questions or how how can they deal with the situation and actually that there would be help for them 

168.56 170.90 A: you know if uh like 

170.93 175.31 A: where they um cal- um col- columbine 

175.32 184.46 A: ah from um where the well to do family they ah kids went and shot other people at the school now 

185.26 192.26 A: you know they may be somebody should of been aware that the these kids had problems 

192.38 199.60 A: you know how could they go all through the school system and nobody felt that these kids had problems 

200.39 204.96 B: how do you think those how do you think the problems came about with these kids because 

205.20 211.06 B: you know i i i firmly believe that if you take a child from the cradle 

211.07 223.30 B: the parent and raise that child properly and give it guidance and a sense of direction it will know where to go how to lead a life for the most part but 

222.42 225.33 A: no i think that's only if the uh parents 

225.42 234.14 A: continually support the child you know that the the children feel they can talk to their parents and their parents can take care of things 

234.07 241.63 A: but if they're in a uh a family where the parents aren't uh aren't functioning right then um 

241.77 248.94 A: there they should have a way that they can get help even for themselves what if the child is abused 

249.11 251.64 A: uh there's somebody they can talk to i 

251.76 256.40 B: so are you saying that society should take the play the role of the parent 

257.85 269.46 A: think so i think so they can't just go to school and be and learn because a lot of would show up they don't come to school see even when they're young 

269.45 273.97 A: and uh we- well maybe nobody was there to wake them up in the morning 

274.78 284.18 A: and they or they don't have clothes to wear to school or some foolish problems like that and they're not getting to school and they're not ready to learn 

285.57 298.08 B: they're not ready to learn that's for sure uh i just wonder if if society should be the one responsible i think what has happened down through the years 

297.99 302.62 B: is that that family structure has deteriorated 

302.52 304.81 A: right yeah 

303.19 310.42 B: uh-huh and so for wha- what i'm gathering with our conversation is that 

310.24 319.26 B: society should make amends for that uh deterioration that's that's an enormous task i would think 

319.09 325.45 A: it certainly is and with budgets being cut the first thing that is cut is social services 

324.97 327.01 B: absolutely 

327.36 333.64 B: so i i me personally i think the only way the situation gonna be remedied 

333.66 342.49 B: ah and i is is going back to the family values and uh i don't see that happening well 

338.32 339.78 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

342.05 346.52 A: well what would you think could be done to improve that 

346.99 347.76 A: (( you know )) 

347.94 358.80 B: you want to know my honest to goodness truth [laughter] from my want i want to say is the honest to goodness truth that i can only express my feelings and my opinion 

350.28 352.10 A: [laughter] yeah 

357.60 358.64 A: mhm 

358.80 372.25 B: and my opinion is that uh the situation is only going to get worse because society's not in a position to take the to play the role of a parent like you say counselling but 

369.75 370.54 A: yeah 

372.12 379.22 B: gosh when you look at the cost involved and and and other factors involved that's gonna be astronomical 

374.42 376.08 A: right 

378.54 379.64 A: yes 

379.42 390.87 B: so it it falls back on the family and reinventing the family value so to speak and parents taking their responsibilities and accepting their responsibilities 

390.38 391.87 A: (( that's right )) 

391.22 393.94 B: and i don't see that happening 

393.37 394.26 A: no 

394.17 407.85 A: you know what people are doing is um they're against abortion well you know i drive by this place and i see these people carrying these awful signs uh how abortion is killing and so on 

407.70 420.97 A: what about raising the child when the child is in a family where he gets beaten up all the time or where the parents aren't feeding them or they're locking them in the closet or some stupid thing like that um 

421.00 431.94 A: you know if people don't want a child they should [laughter] be allowed to have an abortion or something you know they shouldn't be forced to take this child 

431.97 434.13 A: if they don't want it 

433.37 438.79 B: and then just treat it any old kind of way like it's a herd of cattle or something yeah 

438.13 439.45 A: yeah 

439.36 445.17 B: that's very unfortunate there's so many problems in today's society um 

445.66 448.78 B: (( i i don't know thelma i uh i )) 

449.17 461.44 B: don't know that's an astronomical task ahead of us especially when when you look at the public school system the way it is there are definitely problems and with money being at issue 

461.50 462.87 A: mhm 

461.99 464.13 B: and um 

464.56 468.52 B: uh with other things in general being at issue 

468.22 469.32 A: right 

469.46 471.79 B: ah it makes it very difficult 

471.49 473.50 A: where are you calling from 

473.49 475.44 B: los angeles where are you 

475.01 484.40 A: los angeles i'm from uh no ri- i'm from new york state and i think we have the same problems in the schools that you have you 

476.30 476.98 B: oh 

483.98 485.24 B: okay 

484.54 491.83 A: know and our budgets are um very much cut now the governor has just cut the budget 

491.80 501.66 A: and the um legislators they have overridden the budget that was cut by the government but he is asking 

501.56 508.06 A: for citizens to go to court because the the taxes will go up so much he says 

507.92 515.21 B: you know what i don't understand uh thelma right thelma what i do not understand like here in the state of california 

510.75 511.77 A: yes 

516.02 519.70 B: several years ago we instituted the state lottery 

519.89 522.17 A: right now we have it too 

521.98 526.56 B: and for that express purpose of covering these financial problems 

525.91 527.11 A: yes 

526.80 529.10 B: and where is all the money going 

529.09 530.61 A: same thing here 

530.67 531.75 A: i don't know 

533.62 539.42 B: it's it's seem like a problem is greater than it what it was before we had the lottery 

539.10 540.20 A: yes 

540.04 542.35 B: i just don't understand 

540.30 542.77 A: mhm no 

545.62 546.82 A: (( i don't know )) 

547.49 551.10 A: we we do have one idea um 

551.16 553.65 A: that might make things better 

554.56 556.17 B: it how's that 

555.73 560.45 A: do you have one idea of what might make things better 

561.13 567.79 B: well you know i'm gonna tell you the idea that i have i don't see it happen well you in terms you know 

567.91 573.86 B: well since there more than one since there's more than one problem here pros- money is a problem 

574.38 577.48 B: and and we have a social problem here 

577.53 578.76 B: um 

578.80 582.29 B: are you talking about the money problem itself or or everything 

581.56 585.77 A: anything that would improve the school sys- situation 

585.59 594.35 B: well you know so far as financially monetarily speaking i ha- i just don't know what to say there because seem like the main things are in place 

594.57 599.89 B: and with what's in place is just simply not happening when you look at the millions of dollars that get
