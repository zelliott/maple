211.41 213.30 A: well see the money wasn't worth it

221.87 230.06 B: that classifies him as an extremely violent criminal even though he never shot anybody never um you know he pulled it he only pulled it out once [sigh] 

225.83 226.77 A: would he 

230.62 231.73 B: um 

231.77 235.49 A: well if you were given the million dollars would you not speak to your best friend ever again 

236.87 247.49 B: well see i i have too many sneaky ways to get around that now see i could say first of all i could claim that individual is my best friend and he was truthfully just twenty years ago 

247.84 251.82 B: [laughter] and i have no problem not talking to him 'cause i don't talk to him now [sigh] 

253.16 258.19 B: now my current best friend [lipsmack] i don't talk that much too 

259.03 266.50 B: you know we guys i don't think we're not quite as outgoing or whatever but verbally you know i just don't uh

289.57 290.55 B: rented 

291.88 298.65 B: and i'll be on my way i mean that's it's modest income 'cause they're not in the best areas 

296.43 297.31 A: (( [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

299.53 302.93 B: but i i'll have uh you know some money so 

303.17 309.39 B: i ain't poor [laughter] a million sounds like a lot when you're scraping for beans 

309.26 312.50 A: yeah i think when you can afford the necessities 

312.90 315.59 A: any more money doesn't really make you any more happy 

315.51 321.21 B: well not really in fact it also makes you more miserable in my life i've met met m- billionaires 

321.73 329.19 B: who were you know giving literally money to ronald reagan for the iran contra thing um [lipsmack] 

322.08 323.00 A: [noise] 

329.62 332.46 B: i read letters on presidential letterhead 

332.81 335.63 B: thanking them confidentially 

336.27 341.83 B: uh for moneys that you know that were never reported basically so they couldn't be 

342.37 344.67 B: uh tax deducted 

345.35 346.90 B: but uh 

347.81 352.92 B: and i've seen these people in their lives who are really miserable 

353.11 358.00 B: they really were i mean he didn't see his children he was always just concerned about money making more 

358.02 362.32 B: even though he had stacks of it higher than he would ever possibly use 

363.04 364.59 B: it was the game 

364.66 368.42 B: being in the game being part of the people who are in the game 

368.44 374.30 B: playing the game to get more um you know he went out he bought a twelve million dollar house 

374.47 378.76 B: and he made a game with himself he was going to pay for it in ninety days 

378.92 384.77 B: with new money which means money that he earned with a new idea 

384.99 392.33 B: and implemented in just ninety days and earned twelve million actually it took him about a hundred and five days to pay off the house 

391.59 392.43 A: (( mm right [noise] )) 

393.34 394.18 A: (( [noise] well )) 

393.37 396.10 B: but he was that connected 

396.15 401.78 B: and that well off he could he could make twelve million new money in in that short a time 

402.86 403.86 B: so 

402.87 405.60 A: well they say the hardest one to make is the first 

406.23 412.41 B: right and then you know once you know how to do it and you've gotten some of those connections then you know 

406.82 407.42 A: (( of )) 

412.89 418.49 B: even if you fall down and have nothing you can get back up and get back there relatively quickly 

419.04 421.32 B: so [sigh] um 

422.22 424.90 B: no at this point in life i wouldn't take the million 

422.75 423.50 A: course 

425.91 427.00 B: (( for that )) 

427.64 430.65 B: i'd try to negotiate a better deal [laughter] 

432.51 436.01 B: like i wouldn't talk to one of my sisters or something [laughter] 

435.92 438.04 A: [noise] [laughter] that would be easier for me too 

437.34 440.06 B: well they don't talk to me anyway so 

439.54 440.55 A: [laughter] 

441.34 444.79 B: you know of course i i don't call them but they don't call me either 

445.52 448.19 A: see but but then you wouldn't be earning it 

445.85 446.78 B: (( so it wouldn't )) 

448.46 453.19 B: well you wouldn't you're not really supposed to earn it 'cause it's a benefactor 

453.49 457.24 B: he's trying to to help you out right and he's giving you the benefit 

456.75 461.04 A: but there's a condition to it so really you are earning it 

461.06 464.71 B: that's true uh earning it uh 

465.42 468.02 B: being worthy of it somehow 

469.67 475.79 B: now of course what you could do is get the money spend it all real fast and then start talking again 

476.29 478.14 B: [laughter] 

478.11 480.81 A: (( [noise] and then i think you'd have to give it back [laughter] )) 

478.41 480.20 B: just consume it 

480.61 483.09 B: and then then well then they can't get it back 

484.99 487.83 B: [laughter] i sound evil now [laughter]
