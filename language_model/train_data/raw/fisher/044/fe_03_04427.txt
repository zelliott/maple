9.28 10.24 B: (( it's okay )) 

10.47 14.06 B: um i don't what i'd do uh 

13.20 16.34 A: did they say a million dollars to never speak to your loved ones again 

16.34 18.17 B: yeah 

17.30 20.37 A: oh that's no brainer not a chance in hell 

20.81 22.06 B: yeah um 

23.54 24.54 B: (( i don't know )) 

26.56 29.90 B: there uh there's got to be more to the situation than that though 

29.88 31.56 A: are you married 

31.25 32.40 B: (( no no )) 

32.28 33.30 A: okay 

33.61 37.05 A: okay i've got a twenty two month old and i don't think for 

37.43 41.30 A: a hundred million i'd never see him again never talk to him again 

39.87 41.08 B: yeah 

41.76 44.36 A: that uh i don't know that's 

44.45 55.72 B: i'm not saying that i i'm not saying that i wouldn't i mean i would not talk to my loved ones but i don't know it's only a million so you you can't really it's really not that much money 

44.61 45.60 A: not even 

52.71 54.56 A: (( that's what i think )) 

55.56 67.37 A: i agree i i had a call the other night it's like my son for a million dollars and in this day and age a million dollars is not particularly a lot of money i mean don't get me wrong it's i don't have a million dollars but 

67.64 70.85 B: yeah i don't yeah i definitely don't have it but no i don't 

67.66 68.62 A: i'm thirty 

69.72 74.13 A: i'm thirty three years old and uh i- i'm not i consider 

74.73 82.43 A: a much higher number in order to be set for life and never give to a thought to material things again it would about ten to twenty times that probably 

82.68 83.92 B: yeah 

82.94 84.71 A: you know for that to be true 

84.65 88.02 B: i agree i i definitely agree mm 

88.68 89.75 B: [lipsmack] i mean 

90.63 104.91 B: be- because once you you receive the money then there's new people that pop into your life and i doubt that they could ever be as close as the older people simply because i think you put up a defe- like some sort of wall um 

96.19 97.16 A: yeah 

105.28 109.19 B: [lipsmack] like you're afraid that that people are trying to get to your money 

108.60 113.52 A: oh sure i think that uh everybody that g- that wins the lottery or 

113.79 119.51 A: athletes as soon as they get drafted i think that's when they have a new crowd surrounding them and you don't know what they're after 

119.37 121.38 B: right 

120.39 122.52 A: what is your family situation 

123.01 124.95 B: oh i'm i just live alone 

124.68 125.67 A: okay 

125.52 127.17 B: yeah 

126.33 127.47 A: how old are you 

127.36 128.36 B: eighteen 

128.30 129.81 A: (( all right )) 

130.00 131.56 A: are you close to your parents 

130.15 130.90 B: so 

131.67 134.12 B: um i don't really have any parents so 

134.63 139.13 B: um no i can't say that i am [laughter] 

137.35 139.37 A: okay brothers and sisters 

139.18 145.13 B: yeah i have a younger brother and it's a it's a relationship in the works so [lipsmack] 

140.54 141.56 A: okay 

144.46 150.93 A: okay yeah that might explain why you hesitated longer than i did um thinking about it 

149.38 151.97 B: well it's not that i hesitated but 

152.07 154.03 B: hm it's 

154.46 163.42 B: it's an interesting situation i c- see i can't say for sure because i wa- i'm not given the choice and we never know how we react on impulse so 

163.61 166.42 A: yeah yeah well i mean 

164.65 169.49 B: but uh but i definitely but for a million no i wouldn't i mean i wouldn't accept it 

167.54 168.50 A: yeah 

170.60 171.70 A: ten million 

172.10 177.63 B: i don't think so no and i guess it all depends like where i am in that part of my life 

177.93 180.82 B: and who what kind of person i am like 

181.25 183.39 B: but right now i wouldn't you know 

182.66 184.75 A: okay hundred million 

184.70 186.46 B: no no 

185.74 186.70 A: okay 

187.34 198.70 A: uh see i just think you thought longer about it because i'm close to my parents and i've got a wife and a kid and i just can't i mean my world revolves around the particularly the kid 

199.28 202.43 A: um so i wouldn't even consider it that would be 

203.03 206.57 A: a hell [noise] if if i couldn't see him that just wouldn't even be 

204.77 207.71 B: (( mhm )) 

206.95 208.58 A: up for discussion 

208.68 210.06 B: yeah 

210.33 216.76 A: i think the question the other night was would you leave for a million dollars would you leave the country and never come back would you give that any thought 

216.29 221.51 B: [mn] yeah i would g- definitely give that a thought simply because uh there's a lot of places that i want to see 

218.37 219.34 A: okay 

221.45 223.13 A: yeah 

222.26 225.61 B: and that's the right money to see everything 

226.11 229.97 A: yeah i think i kinda had the same attitude if if it wasn't 

230.13 234.25 A: a million isn't gonna hook me up for life a 

234.09 236.96 B: yeah but wait did you say a hundred million 

234.78 235.96 A: million might give 

236.85 238.46 A: no one million 

238.24 240.75 B: oh to go to another country 

240.08 242.71 A: yeah to never return to united states 

242.37 246.14 B: i don't know that would run out quickly i thought you said a hundred million 

244.24 245.64 A: (( yeah it would )) 

245.70 247.24 A: (( no no )) 

247.62 251.71 A: it was a million again and you know like what you said a million is 

252.61 256.33 A: it takes a lot more than that to never give money another thought in your life 

256.32 258.06 B: yeah 

257.37 259.09 A: uh where are you 

259.21 260.73 B: uh new york

270.93 271.94 A: okay 

271.97 274.07 A: i've only been to new york once it was 

274.57 280.20 A: for work i didn't really do anything other than go on for meetings and hang out a little bit but nothing too exciting 

280.51 282.08 A: did you grow up there 

280.72 281.60 B: yeah 

282.09 285.88 B: no no no um i go to school here i go to n._y._u. so

288.81 290.48 A: right wow what got you up there 

290.67 292.63 B: uh new york 

292.18 293.06 A: okay 

292.94 296.15 B: so yeah there's a lot of opportunities up here so 

296.03 297.77 A: yeah without a doubt 

296.43 298.19 B: i might as well be somewhere 

298.26 300.78 A: yeah yeah 

298.30 299.34 B: like here 

299.58 302.83 B: i'm not really s- you know like i'm not really a small town 

302.84 307.43 B: like i like lots and lots of things well at least right now i do 

307.45 308.72 A: yeah 

309.05 314.88 A: yeah well this is a hard one to talk about 'cause i just don't think uh 

314.77 317.23 B: yeah there's not much of a debate here so [laughter] 

316.53 319.33 A: no there there's really there's really not 

319.63 327.53 A: it's uh pretty much a black and white issue not a no way in hell and no sense talking about it i mean i might go 

328.03 331.74 A: if they said a million to to not see somebody for a year 

331.64 334.01 B: yeah i c- i could do that 

331.93 333.33 A: i could look at 

333.37 336.17 A: yeah i could look at it as well an investment for my 

336.32 346.09 A: loved one's future so i could do that or two years maybe but uh have to be a lot of money and uh the mindset of well the only reason i'm doing it is to 

346.49 351.60 A: to help him out to pay for his school or to put money away for him or whatever the case may be but to 

351.47 353.12 B: yeah 

351.78 354.59 A: never see him again is is insane 

355.90 356.93 B: (( hm [lipsmack] )) 

359.76 362.01 A: so how did you find out about this deal 

362.24 370.06 B: i think um i i just came across it online i think and i thought it was a joke i was like hopefully they don't call 

369.96 371.06 A: yeah 

370.47 381.97 B: and then they did call one day and um i got really nervous so i hung up just because like i get weird when i think i'm not a phone person but then they said thirty dollars so it was like ah 

374.95 377.01 A: [laughter] 

383.34 385.99 B: i don't really know if they pay you or not but 

385.42 399.08 A: i don't either my wife did her third one she does she stays home with the baby and does um like mystery shopping and uh so she signed me up she said it was real easy and it is but she did her third one about three days ago and hadn't gotten a check so 

390.41 391.82 B: (( oh okay [lipsmack] i )) 

399.09 405.83 A: i just don't know who is d- i g- i don't know if the if the research is to see how strangers talk for ten minutes 

405.97 415.51 A: or i i don't understand the point um i can't imagine anybody out there any researchers are really give a damn if somebody would leave their 

415.76 420.83 A: loved ones for a million dollars or she had one about perjury would you lie under oath or 

421.00 423.56 A: i don't know if it's the point of it is to 

423.98 429.10 A: see how people interact or i don't know what it is i can't comprehend why people pay money for this 

429.19 430.47 B: yeah 

431.34 434.66 B: there's a lot of ridiculous things that people pay money for 

434.48 435.84 A: [mn] true 

435.68 443.72 B: like like for example um there's this research program and like they award money to students who are researching some idea 

443.88 457.66 B: and this person is uh like researching the velvet underground which is a k- is a band like a famous band like that that originated in new york like in the seventies and they're giving him like ten thousand dollars to do this research 

451.25 452.31 A: yeah 

457.67 460.82 B: on how the velvet underground relates to new york 

460.90 461.83 A: huh 

461.44 464.34 B: which i think is ridiculous it's a waste of ten thousand dollars 

463.94 466.55 A: yes it is yes it is i've 

465.21 469.19 B: when they could be giving like more students money to go here you know 

468.19 469.02 A: yeah 

469.18 471.33 A: yeah w- when you see a study that they 

471.42 477.60 A: you know spend a million dollars to find out that kids are fat and it's not healthy well no shit you know [laughter] it doesn't 

476.17 479.93 B: y- yeah i know that that's ridiculous yeah 

478.18 479.88 A: yeah 

480.33 485.48 A: (( yeah i see 'em all the time and you think well that's you know from the department of the obvious thanks for )) 

485.18 487.30 B: yeah that's true [laughter] 

486.48 492.85 A: thanks for telling me like stuff's on the news about high blood pressure being bad well thanks a lot that was 

493.27 494.76 A: (( that was real helpful )) 

496.27 498.38 A: is this your second or third call 

498.43 500.25 B: [laughter] it's uh my first 

499.98 502.01 A: oh it's your first okay 

501.03 508.23 B: yeah yeah the first one i hung up and then they called me back and it wasn't working or something i don't know 

502.37 503.35 A: okay 

508.38 509.41 A: okay 

508.59 512.44 B: so and i'm usually not home they catch me at really weird hours so 

512.48 516.86 A: yeah my wife did a pretty good job of she did everything signed up and did a pretty good job of 

517.02 519.97 A: when i'm going to be here and what nights i'm at home so it's been 

520.17 524.57 A: like one night i wasn't free but it's only been like a week since i started so 

524.59 528.32 A: hopefully thirty easy dollars and we just don't have to worry about anything 

528.73 529.95 B: this is true 

532.57 537.54 A: [laughter] so hopefully we're winding up here so i guess we should say in summary no 

537.56 538.88 B: [laughter] yeah no 

538.33 543.24 A: i wouldn't take a [laughter] million dollars to never see my loved ones again and that's a silly question 'cause 

543.00 544.88 B: yeah 

543.77 546.99 A: wouldn't even think about it for a half a second 

548.11 555.65 A: uh my wife like i said she had perjury the other night i mean what are you supposed to say are you the hate to be the person that takes the pro side of that debate 

556.00 558.21 A: um for perjury 

556.05 556.65 B: (( [mn] )) 

558.45 559.41 B: you are 

559.40 565.43 A: no i said i'd hate to be the person who has to take this the guy that says i'm for perjury you know that's kind of 

565.46 566.52 A: similar 

566.71 570.08 A: no brainer type question would you commit perjury 

568.34 572.28 B: well i think there are instances in which 

573.16 577.04 B: i mean i don't i don't know i don't know i guess it depends on the situation 

576.94 579.39 A: yeah yeah if it was 

578.01 582.46 B: because there are there are exceptions to every rule 

582.89 589.67 B: and a lot of thought should be especially if you're going g- do something like that there's a lot of thought that should go into it 

590.43 596.52 A: yeah i guess if somebody was gonna put my dad in jail or something i would probably lie for him 

596.53 599.89 A: like to think i wouldn't but i probably would if it came right down to it
