355.12 358.55 A: who have their children in chi- child care and they don't 

358.68 363.43 A: uh they you know a couple of games read a co- couple books and then they play 

363.56 364.57 B: right 

363.96 368.66 A: and uh i want something more more for my for my for my money let's just say 

368.81 369.37 A: (( you )) 

368.99 369.90 B: definitely 

369.40 372.94 A: know if i'm gonna spend it i want it spent wisely 

372.69 373.84 B: right 

374.09 376.58 A: but uh but as far as you know my son he's in 

376.73 382.37 A: he he's our our other son he's in elementary school uh no no real issues um 

379.50 380.24 B: (( mm )) 

382.41 385.81 A: wi- with the teachers at that you know i think they're doing a real good job 

385.84 386.92 A: um 

387.14 395.24 A: also what's important is uh if you know having a school uh and your teachers as well they they always stay in touch with the parents 

395.28 396.12 B: right 

395.47 404.25 A: they just don't just you know you know when i went to school you know the only the only only time a teacher called call- called the parents is when i weren't there you know what i mean 

402.41 403.27 B: right 

403.72 404.95 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

404.34 408.23 A: well you know james james skipped another day this is you know the number seven 

408.33 409.74 A: (( you know so )) 

410.31 411.69 A: but uh 

411.24 416.60 B: yeah i think uh for the most part there has to be a sufficient amount of parent involvement 

416.30 428.44 A: oh exactly you know when i when i was school you know as i say i went to the i went to the city um you know i was involved in some gang gang action stuff like that and it was all wrong it truly was 

417.30 418.11 B: yeah 

421.08 421.88 B: mhm 

426.99 428.12 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

428.54 432.15 A: but um so then you know well then i went to 

432.14 445.28 A: suburbs and i act- actually went to a private school uh with with that in mind and i now right there's kinda kinda like what turned my life around you know so so you know i i kinda had both been to bo- bo- both worlds 

445.20 446.84 B: right 

446.01 447.83 A: and definitely you know 

447.95 448.92 A: um 

449.57 455.14 A: i yeah i well actually yeah money is the key and that's just the way i see it um 

455.27 459.22 A: you know you mo- move to a ni- nicer area you get a nicer school 

459.58 460.49 B: mm i see 

461.07 462.06 B: i guess 

462.64 464.66 B: that sounds like something that would work 

465.42 470.89 B: uh i don't know i've just mostly seen public schools so i don't really know but mhm 

469.85 473.75 A: yeah it's it it's really tough man to be honest with you man see i i been 

473.92 477.48 A: you know i've been been on bo- both sides and um 

477.87 480.67 A: you know like when i was at school there was a lot of racial 

480.74 482.82 A: black and white um 

481.73 482.49 B: right 

483.13 495.10 A: and uh and the teachers really didn't uh i mean they they knew it obviously but but but there was never a pro- proper program where where where they could take a gro- group of trouble kids 

495.29 506.59 A: and do do do something with them it was either you know you're in class you do the work or you don't and then the teacher what- what so ever tell you you either do the work or you don't you know and um 

504.21 505.42 B: (( right yeah )) 

507.02 519.10 A: and then i'm on- i'm only speaking from you know my uh experience and the ones that don't do the work they're just kinda kinda like shunted aside and and uh 

516.75 517.76 B: yeah 

519.02 525.18 B: i've i've seen that where usually they just get pushed on to another teacher and let it become their problem 

520.43 521.36 A: yeah 

524.55 534.96 A: right and you sit in the back of the class uh you know you you don't get called called upon for nothing the on- the only time you ever go up front is when you're sitting right beside the teacher's desk 'cause you got in trouble 

534.33 535.58 B: right 

535.15 536.29 A: (( you know so )) 

536.62 537.73 A: (( um )) 

538.08 539.90 A: but uh 

540.39 553.95 A: yeah it kinda kin- kinda like where i've been uh but of course my kids now they're um i feel that they're very well well rounded and schools schools here are good um you know there's a lo- lot of pro- programs after school 

549.86 551.71 B: right 

553.88 556.98 A: uh for them and al- also during during the summer 

557.27 558.00 B: (( mm ))

562.33 564.19 B: the budget been for this year 

564.38 566.52 B: over there anyway yeah 

564.41 565.93 A: for the school 

566.31 569.29 A: (( uh it uh well )) 

569.49 580.65 A: uh like couple of ye- years ago they did did tax increase because uh where where yeah be- because it's not for say city it's kinda like on the edge of you know what i mean 

569.57 571.77 B: or is it like a private school 

580.26 581.36 B: right 

580.67 581.80 A: so
