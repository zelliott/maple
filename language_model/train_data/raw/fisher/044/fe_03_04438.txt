15.06 16.40 B: right 

16.94 18.46 B: (( [laughter] )) 

17.58 19.55 A: this is a fun thing to do isn't it 

18.96 23.80 B: oh it sure is it's very interesting did you wanna go first 

20.06 22.10 A: yeah yeah 

23.65 28.73 A: oh about the are are are you uh the subject is our public schools 

28.11 30.05 B: right right 

29.17 33.15 A: w- well i i don't think our public schools are 

33.20 35.95 A: are are teaching what they should be teaching 

35.91 37.58 B: [laughter] i agree with that 

36.93 42.60 A: yeah in in delaware they teach from kindergarten right through high school evolution 

42.63 43.60 B: uh-huh 

43.31 47.54 A: at as a as a fact of life which i'm dead set against 

46.96 49.15 B: oh i see oh yeah that's 

49.43 54.48 A: they teach that we evolved out of a out of the dust of the ground on the 

53.67 55.76 B: oh i didn't even think of that 

55.78 58.10 B: portion of it that's a good point though 

57.73 59.68 A: yeah they teach that uh 

59.71 64.58 A: we uh our our ancestors were apes and monkeys and uh 

63.96 64.88 B: uh-huh 

64.85 69.60 A: and we evolved from that and i don't know what we're going to evolve into [laughter] 

68.77 73.19 B: [laughter] you you mean rather than the adam and eve theory 

70.14 72.03 A: and but i i think 

72.95 84.10 A: yeah well i think that they should teach uh uh along with it uh creationism that god created the world and he created us as being just the way we are 

80.63 81.83 B: right 

83.65 86.44 B: even if it's another opinion 

86.57 88.01 A: (( mhm yes oh )) 

86.65 92.60 B: you know as an alter- i i yeah but you know what i would wonder i wonder if 

92.76 103.54 B: um possibly the separation of church and state has effected that because when i was a kid we s- you know we said the lord's prayer and 

103.63 107.10 B: (( recited uh uh a um [lipsmack] a psalm )) 

106.80 107.96 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

107.28 109.31 B: saluted the flag 

109.56 114.48 A: but there's no such thing as as a legal separation of state 

113.82 116.04 B: i don't believe there can be either 

115.00 118.29 A: it is is that is not in the constitution 

117.69 119.25 B: no no 

118.49 123.86 A: what the constitution says is that government cannot establish a religion 

124.00 138.09 A: and the reason they did that was um at that at that time in europe and i guess it still is in some countries that uh the the the the government established a certain religion as the state religion 

137.69 138.60 B: right 

138.28 146.91 A: like in germany uh they sup- the state supported the lutheran church and they taxed the people to pay for the church 

139.38 140.39 B: exactly 

143.06 143.93 B: (( mm )) 

147.06 151.49 A: and uh in some some countries it was the catholic church 

150.96 151.99 B: right 

151.82 160.73 A: uh but uh and then they didn't want that to happen in this church in this country they never said that there should be a a a a division 

161.19 171.84 A: but it uh but they didn't want government infringing onto onto religion and that's what that's about and also i don't think the church uh the uh the schools should be teaching 

161.26 162.03 B: mm 

171.94 177.11 A: uh sex edu- education without uh teaching the morals of it 

176.68 178.05 B: (( [lipsmack] exactly )) 

177.89 178.83 A: (( you know )) 

178.12 191.38 B: i i'm a i'm a little stressed to discover that they're they're providing condoms in but uh uh that to me that is just i i just can't understand that at all 

183.92 184.82 A: (( yes )) 

187.18 188.32 A: mhm 

190.92 192.04 A: (( yeah mm )) 

191.37 197.81 B: if that isn't e- encouraging a kid who's not emotionally equipped 

197.44 198.85 A: [laughter] 

198.23 206.02 B: you know now i don't care about physically equipped but you know when those hormones wh- when those hormones are raging 

199.12 200.20 A: yeah 

201.88 204.31 A: oh they're physically equipped [laughter] 

205.63 206.78 A: (( oh yes )) 

206.56 207.95 B: there's a lot 

208.74 218.51 B: o- of emotional responsibility and to be able to walk into a [laughter] a high school bathroom and purchase condoms 

211.46 212.52 A: uh-huh 

218.85 222.31 A: yeah well they issue them the health person issues them 

221.73 223.49 B: yeah yeah 

222.73 223.72 A: uh 

223.83 227.89 A: whoever's in ch- it's like the nurse or or the instructor 

227.69 228.83 B: m- yeah 

228.13 229.67 A: in healthcare or something 

229.32 232.74 B: but i i i just i just don't think it's a good idea 

232.50 233.68 A: (( no y- yeah )) 

232.85 236.85 B: you know i but i i also believe that there's 

237.04 241.27 B: i think there's a a lack of discipline at home 

241.03 242.91 A: mhm 

242.13 245.03 B: more so than there was when i was a youngster 

244.87 248.70 A: oh you think mom you think mom and dad ought to be talking about it huh 

245.26 246.48 B: and 

248.09 255.69 B: oh i do i'm a firm believer um i i agree there were plenty of mothers and fathers who were 

249.29 250.04 A: (( [laughter] )) 

250.74 251.89 A: (( yeah uh-huh )) 

256.51 260.99 B: how do you say nicely uneducated about sex 

261.22 267.52 B: [noise] and i- i- in some ways i think that could be dangerous also but um 

267.71 275.16 B: [noise] you know the or or were just so too embarrassed to talk about it and kids got themselves into trouble but [mn] 

275.51 279.41 B: you know to to expect these these schools 

279.52 286.20 B: to provide all this stuff no and and and aside from that i think there are a lot of things we leave out 

286.36 287.31 B: you know 

287.41 291.53 B: we came to this country under the guise of religious freedom 

291.11 292.75 A: (( mhm mhm mhm )) 

292.37 294.94 B: and then did everything we could 

295.80 299.78 B: to take everything away from from the uh 

300.01 301.97 B: people who were here 

301.44 302.78 A: mhm 

302.16 307.18 B: we have used and abused people of other races

329.91 332.96 A: yeah well i never knew it for a long time after world war two 

331.89 335.28 B: but but you know that's an important part of this 

335.76 337.17 B: country 

336.46 338.29 A: mhm 

337.34 345.06 B: a- a- a- and people who my son i mean my brother was out in [laughter] colorado in the uh air force 

345.03 357.41 B: he never knew that one of those bases right near there had been used as a concentration camp oh well we don't call 'em concentration camps that that the polite word was what p._o._w.s or 

351.29 352.55 A: (( mhm ))

562.16 562.76 B: (( [mn] [mn] )) 

566.79 567.83 B: right 

567.69 571.22 A: and then the uh the politicians found ways to 

570.98 572.29 B: to get around it 

571.33 578.87 A: to infringe on their their rights and then when then they wanted to fight to keep their ground they they were savages 

576.42 577.65 B: mhm
