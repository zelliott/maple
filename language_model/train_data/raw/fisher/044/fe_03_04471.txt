0.96 2.24 A: (( hello )) 

3.43 4.89 A: yeah my name is nick 

4.65 6.15 B: hi i'm jennifer 

6.49 7.60 A: good to meet you 

7.69 9.19 B: nice to meet you too 

10.27 12.31 B: so public schools 

14.25 16.86 A: well we home school our kids 

17.75 18.85 A: so 

17.79 18.84 B: oh okay 

19.04 21.57 A: that's healthy right there mm 

22.26 28.37 A: um i don't think there's necessarily something wrong with american public schools i think there's something wrong with the whole idea of uh 

29.27 30.37 A: forced 

30.62 32.75 A: internment camps for children 

34.54 38.96 A: i don't think they should be away from their families for that much time in the day 

38.88 42.14 B: oh well but what about either where parents have to work 

42.99 49.83 A: i don't think that if there's two parents together i don't think there's any excuse for both of them to work 

50.25 53.16 B: yeah but sometimes they you can't financially make it 

53.76 59.45 A: yeah you can you just gotta set your priorities different that's i mean i know that sounds probably 

60.42 62.36 A: um 

62.88 65.16 A: arrogant or pushy but 

65.35 78.50 B: well i think it may be a little unrealistic with just with the economy the way it is right now and just sort of in general in order you can't always with what people make in different positions you can't always do it 

78.59 84.78 A: so what's the what's the least amount of money that a family of five people can live on in your opinion mhm 

84.77 97.20 B: i don't know i haven't i mean right now i don't have any kids i mean i i have a house so we you know i've crunched numbers on that and we're having a hard time making it right now 'cause one of us was laid off and i'm trying to finish my doctorate so 

98.27 101.60 B: you know it's just sorta sometimes you can't always 

102.59 104.43 B: you just can't always do it 

105.16 106.12 A: well 

106.39 107.48 A: i make 

107.49 109.85 A: about twelve thousand dollars a year 

111.05 114.15 A: and um my wife stays home with the kids 

114.17 120.04 B: i guess it depends what part of the country you live in see the living expenses where we are and in order to buy a house 

114.29 115.46 A: and 

121.03 132.47 A: well we bought a house i mean it's not it's not a we're way below the poverty line here too but it's what it's what our priorities are and if we didn't think that 

133.69 137.32 A: that the children were going to be the most important part of our lives 

137.57 140.00 A: and that what they needed most was 

140.31 144.73 A: um constant love from their parents then we wouldn't of had them 

146.25 153.70 B: i guess i feel like i still got constant love from my parents even though i went to public schools so i was away for a good chunk of the day 

154.58 159.20 B: like i don't think one i don't think it they're necessarily mutually exclusive 

159.98 167.83 A: i i didn't mean like 'cause they didn't love you i meant that at least when when they're when you're small 

168.88 172.29 A: that you have twenty four seven 

173.11 174.02 A: um 

174.45 177.10 A: loving contact with them 

177.28 180.96 A: at least up to you know a certain age maybe four or five 

181.13 185.77 A: and i realize the school starts after that but even then 

188.24 190.53 A: i don't i don't think families should be 

191.78 193.14 A: split up that way 

195.23 200.38 B: i think it's i mean obviously there is the option for families to make that decision not to do that 

200.38 201.67 A: mhm 

202.26 206.09 B: but i also think that there is def- i for me i mean my 

206.12 211.82 B: degree is going to be an education grounding my entire education for dealing with you know colleges and universities 

211.81 214.73 B: i kinda think you know that there can be some benefits 

214.60 227.97 B: to the whole school experience 'cause you get to interact with different children and interact with people of different backgrounds from yourself and you you just you learn a lot from peer interactions and i know you can have that with home schooling and i'm not against home schooling 

228.23 234.34 B: but uh because i know there's you know extracurricular activities that you can do outside the home that get that peer benefit 

234.90 235.91 B: but 

236.54 237.50 B: (( you know )) 

238.08 245.34 B: i think there's a lot of problems with public schooling but i guess i just think calling it an internment camp for children is a little bit harsh 

246.27 247.97 A: yeah well that's what i believe 

248.58 251.93 B: and that's that's cool it's also well anyway 

252.81 254.02 B: (( and i mean )) 

254.48 257.29 B: you know i think they need to put some more funding into our 

257.31 261.42 B: into our public schools or equalize it so that all school districts 

261.50 265.12 B: get the same amount not just the wealthy school districts getting all the money 

269.87 275.74 B: um i think my i'm a big proponent that everyone should get some you know that you should get to choose what you think 

275.75 281.60 B: is the right is the right decision you know whether that's home schooling or where that whether that's 

278.41 280.22 A: mhm 

281.91 285.15 B: public school or private school or a parochial school 

286.00 287.89 A: right 

287.87 288.65 B: um 

290.86 293.02 B: i don't know just to me it sounds like you're 

293.27 297.51 B: making some judgements about about other people's choices 

297.73 300.45 A: yes well i mean it you know 

301.76 302.90 A: it's 

303.56 307.31 A: a hu- it's a human's right to have an opinion about other people's choices 

307.34 309.15 A: and it's also 

309.78 311.28 A: human nature to 

312.46 313.48 A: um 

314.17 322.51 A: since people do what they consider to be right they consider the things that they do to be right if that wasn't too convoluted of a sentence there 

322.71 324.02 A: (( did it make sense )) 

323.95 336.07 B: right but i can still think that the choices that i'm making are right and think of the pe- choices that other people make are right as well like i it's not necessarily like well my choice is right and yours is wrong like you can say that there's multiple options that are correct 

332.15 333.01 A: (( uh )) 

336.26 337.49 A: yeah that's true 

337.45 345.45 B: yeah it may be that like you think that your position is right and other people's is wrong but you can think that there's a multiple of correct options for everyone 

345.66 346.60 A: mhm 

347.77 348.72 B: um 

348.98 359.48 B: you know i mean i i don't know you know when my partner and i have kids i don't know if we're both i don't know if one of us is going to stay home i think economically it's not going to necessarily be an option and 

360.65 362.37 B: i don't even know 

363.06 371.59 B: some of it's economic and then it's also like if if we both love our careers and love what we do and enjoy that how do you decide who stays home [laughter] 

372.75 376.27 A: yeah well as far as the economic part goes 

376.64 382.64 A: like i said it's how such a priority that's the choices you make it's whether you want 

383.42 387.47 A: whether you want to stay home with your kids bad enough to 

387.98 391.03 A: to make sacrifices in other areas of your life 

390.98 393.64 B: well i think there's certain sacrifices that you be 

394.07 396.28 B: you know i don't know like just 

396.75 401.67 B: being able to pay rent and groceries and stuff you know rent or mortgage or whatever 

402.30 407.90 B: and i think how some of it depends on the part of the country that you live in i have where i am it's it's pricey 

410.11 422.82 A: oh yeah it's not i mean it the in areas that where that it's more expensive the cost of living is more expensive and the cost of labor is more expensive too in other words 

422.33 430.01 B: some way i mean everyone always says that about oh i live in the midwest you know that the houses we were talking about this with some friends of ours that their 

430.08 439.97 B: because we each bought houses within about a year of each other and how much cheaper the prices were like where my partner grew up in michigan 

440.09 450.02 B: but then everyone's like oh well you know but they pay more where we live and they pay more but it's maybe it's like ten grand more it's not some huge amount 

450.02 455.64 B: it's not like this massive difference that everyone thinks that it is you know and 

456.03 456.81 A: (( mm )) 

457.73 461.51 A: i don't know how much money you make but ten grand's a lot of money 

458.09 459.85 B: i guess just that 

461.18 464.07 B: i i don't well i don't make i'm i'm 

464.50 472.81 B: i'm working on my phd right now and i'm working part time so i'm not making very much money and my partner was just laid off so he's not making anything 

473.11 475.63 B: right now and trying to you know 

476.37 479.81 B: he's looking like crazy for something else and 

479.97 481.55 B: it's just not out there 

482.77 483.83 B: so 

484.57 486.42 B: there's certain realities 

488.07 489.06 B: um 

490.30 491.69 B: that are there 

491.91 492.67 B: (( i )) 

492.01 493.80 A: mhm 

493.11 497.81 B: think we've strayed from what the the question that they want us to actually talk about is uh 

498.56 503.62 A: well i didn't think the question's mattered i just thought they were like an ice breaker or something oh 

502.73 506.22 B: yeah i don't know i thought they kinda wanted you to stay relatively 

507.00 507.92 A: really 

507.11 510.47 B: on but that was just my impression [laughter] 

510.68 516.43 A: yeah they didn't they didn't really tell me anything more other that that just didn't rattling on for ten minutes with each call 

517.22 518.23 A: (( so huh )) 

520.61 521.42 B: um
