0.21 1.20 A: [noise] 

0.83 2.31 B: hi chris how 

2.33 3.55 A: (( hi i'm peter [noise] uh )) 

3.70 4.67 B: (( you doing )) 

4.64 6.23 A: (( i'm fine how are you )) 

5.92 7.36 B: good 

7.82 14.29 A: well that's t- terrific uh um we're supposed to talk about uh uh uh getting a million for not seeing our friend again 

8.16 8.72 B: (( [mn] )) 

14.35 15.66 B: (( right [laughter] )) 

15.06 18.34 A: [laughter] [noise] well that's [laughter] 

15.75 16.69 B: (( it )) 

17.29 19.18 B: (( would be nice to get a million huh )) 

18.99 23.90 A: well a million would be nice it's but it's it's a mighty hypothetical thing isn't it [laughter] 

23.29 25.05 B: it sure is 

24.46 25.35 A: (( um )) 

25.44 27.92 B: very odd um 

26.63 27.27 A: [noise] 

27.37 31.88 A: w- would we be able to choose our friend if uh n- nobody told us um 

31.98 34.80 A: so it it it it must be our best friend um 

34.98 40.54 B: that's what it seemed like what they they asked is it has to be your best friend so um 

34.99 35.56 A: (( [noise] )) 

40.24 43.28 A: it's not always so easy to to determine [noise] 

43.51 52.80 B: yeah exactly so um how do you det- determine your best friend 'cause what if you have like one but you have other friends that are close but not your best friend 

52.20 60.33 A: w- that is exactly my point [noise] uh uh um i have uh uh yeah many good friends n- not that many actually but uh uh um 

60.43 61.11 A: to 

61.34 66.65 A: pick one and say this is my best um i would give me a hard time [noise] 

66.69 68.58 B: yeah exactly 

68.07 69.88 A: [laughter] uh um 

68.61 69.60 B: (( [laughter] i agree )) 

70.52 77.38 B: but i i was wondering if you if you ge- if you got a million dollars you could make a lot of no- another good friends [laughter] 

76.43 80.60 A: [noise] [noise] [laughter] just with the money well they would like you for the money [laughter] 

79.72 86.45 B: [laughter] exactly [laughter] 'cause i'm wondering these people that win the lottery how many new friends they actually get 

86.05 87.69 A: (( as long as the money lasts )) 

87.58 90.66 B: yeah so i know uh 

88.35 89.57 A: yeah 

91.43 93.54 B: but it happens as far as 

93.60 95.44 B: you know if they ever 

94.76 95.45 A: (( [noise] )) 

95.72 101.18 B: if they did win they um i think i know their lives changed considerably 

96.81 97.46 A: (( [noise] )) 

101.67 104.48 A: (( i i guess so mostly yeah )) 

106.60 107.61 B: so 

106.75 113.14 A: [mn] i i i i can't really imagine what to do with all that money i mean i could buy a nice camera [noise] [laughter] 

109.87 113.63 B: [laughter] i could find a way to do something 

113.31 115.34 A: [laughter] yeah that i i 

113.93 117.77 B: i'd be m- i i think i'd be smarter with it than most people 'cause i think 

117.64 129.77 B: uh when you're given a chance of a million dollars most people would probably blow it but if you're smart and if you've worked your whole life and worked hard for the money that you do have i think you're pretty smart on 

127.18 128.14 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

129.62 140.31 B: uh spending the rest of it if you got if you if it was just handed to you i think if you're smart enough and you've worked hard enough for all the money that you have had then 

140.00 143.46 A: yeah yeah yeah you could try to invest it somehow probably [noise] 

142.80 144.16 B: exactly but 

143.93 158.79 B: l- like if if you're an older person and and you win a million dollars i think they're they're more likely to to blow it and have a good time and well i don't know i guess it all depends i mean sometimes older people are m- a little bit more responsible with their money so 

152.34 153.12 A: (( [noise] well )) 

154.84 155.75 A: yeah 

159.03 162.54 B: whereas younger people don't really care and they think they're gonna live forever 

162.32 164.38 A: [laughter] but th- 

162.84 170.12 B: so a million dollars i- is a million dollars [laughter] [laughter] they think it'll last forever but obviously it doesn't so 

166.45 167.49 A: (( yeah right [noise] )) 

170.30 178.97 A: what do you think how how important is the fact how desperately [noise] you need [noise] money to to answer [noise] the question whether you would refrain from seeing your friend again 

178.70 186.98 B: exactly [laughter] i mean how important i- 'cause obviously a million dollars isn't gonna last forever but if you invest it well then it will so 

186.24 191.49 A: yeah it it's a lot of money [noise] but i- if you say you have a decent job and you earn 

187.08 188.86 B: um 

191.93 197.52 A: [sigh] i don't know a a a a nice a- amount of money every month [noise] that that's enough for a living 

197.54 201.23 A: uh you wouldn't really need that million 

201.08 202.16 B: right 

201.60 203.51 A: and then so you [noise] 

203.52 207.36 A: uh it it would be much easier to say no to that offer a- a- 

207.05 208.41 B: oh of course 

207.25 214.28 A: and if you don't have a job you're unemployed and then and you have [noise] a lot of of debts and and um uh uh 

214.17 222.84 A: i don't know uh uh you're desperate anyway and uh uh so you might as well on the other hand in such a situation you you would need friends even more [laughter] 

222.02 225.22 B: oh of course yeah i agree u- 

223.33 226.38 A: so you would i don't know it's that's a tricky situation 

225.50 238.31 B: um yeah i mean i i live as far as you know i'm comfortable with my life as far as the money i make and uh it's not a lot but it's enough to make me happy and as long as i have a roof over my head and food on the table 

226.44 227.08 A: [laughter] 

238.01 238.95 A: (( [noise] right )) 

238.32 248.89 B: i'm i'm satisfied so you know a million is a is great but uh you know your friends will last forever for you and it's hard to find good friends nowadays 

248.59 253.78 A: [noise] yeah that's actually that's actually very true to f- find a real friend to 

253.98 259.57 A: [noise] who would last uh and be be truer than the money [laughter] uh 

258.56 260.38 B: yeah exactly 

259.76 262.76 A: if you had such a friend uh uh uh um [noise] 

263.12 266.48 A: you might be better off not giving it up and uh uh uh uh 

267.16 268.30 B: yeah 

267.20 268.78 A: not taking the money 

268.54 269.83 B: exactly 'cause 

269.90 279.02 B: i live in california and i know when i i first moved here i made a ton of friends but after a couple of years i finally realized who my true friends were and there wasn't that many 

278.44 280.24 A: (( yeah i i [noise] )) 

279.03 286.67 B: so it's hard it really is hard to find good friends and people that you can trust and rely on and i think that's 

283.50 284.16 A: [noise] 

286.86 296.53 B: that's you know a major point as far as people that will be by your side no matter what even if you're poor or even if you're rich 

294.66 295.36 A: (( or )) 

296.93 308.74 A: yeah that's right i live in los angeles now and i came there two years ago from europe and and [noise] uh uh a lot of things are lot more superficial than i uh uh uh used to think [laughter] 

306.51 310.10 B: [laughter] especially in la [laughter] 

309.49 312.70 A: yeah right it's apparently the worst [noise] town to come for it [laughter] 

312.03 323.03 B: [laughter] oh my gosh it's the if there's any superficial city it's that that and maybe new york but uh yeah l._a.'s the the king of superficiality i think 

321.51 322.35 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

322.44 329.56 A: yeah it's it's uh it's amazing uh uh i i i [laughter] [noise] i work at the at the university in u._c._l._a. so uh um 

329.70 334.10 A: people i meet there i are mostly okay because they are not from from here 

334.18 335.11 B: yeah 

334.36 344.17 A: they come from all over the world and and uh uh it it's quite a a a it's it's a great community [noise] but uh i'd sooner [noise] to go out of of of that uh uh 

344.22 353.08 A: circle and and meet people who actually live here and have been living here for a long time especially that that that movie stuff it's it's [noise] that's awful 

352.07 358.43 B: oh yeah [laughter] because people are always trying to impress somebody to get somewhere in in life in that town 

353.93 354.63 A: (( [laughter] )) 

356.67 357.47 A: yeah 

358.29 362.07 A: and there are really so many actresses uh uh uh who are 

362.41 364.59 A: just haven't been discovered yet 

364.19 365.89 B: oh yeah [laughter] 

365.92 367.50 A: (( and uh yeah )) 

366.89 369.16 B: and they're still looking and whatnot 

369.02 374.23 A: and they probably would uh give up their friends quite easily for a million d- million dollars 

373.20 382.99 B: oh yeah big time because the friends they do have are are probably just fly by nights and the people you go out with and whatnot but uh 

375.31 376.14 A: (( [laughter] )) 

379.52 380.61 A: yeah 

383.10 387.71 B: it's you know do you do you see a lot of that in um 

387.86 391.79 B: [mn] that people that moved there have changed or do you think 

390.76 392.82 A: yes i i actually see that 

392.84 394.31 B: (( yeah and that's sad )) 

394.12 396.39 A: uh uh so people coming 

396.50 400.27 A: [mn] it depends a bit on the reason why they came uh if 

400.73 408.55 A: they came to to uh uh take their chances in in the show [noise] business and and film world then they change a lot rather quickly 

408.40 409.70 B: yeah 

409.11 413.61 A: i i met a bunch of journalists [noise] uh uh over a friend of mine [noise] 

413.75 418.26 A: and and these journalists are are are i- in the film scene and and over 

418.28 423.65 A: these friends and at k- at some parties i i met some film people and that's it's really interesting 

423.54 424.47 B: uh-huh 

423.76 424.52 A: [noise] 

424.62 431.24 A: you think they are kinda nice and then then [noise] uh uh over the the month [noise] they they totally changed 

430.63 431.61 B: wow 

431.78 438.01 A: so they they meet somebody who seems to be somehow influential and and they uh prostitute themselves 

432.03 432.90 B: (( i )) 

437.64 439.32 B: yeah that's true 

438.89 441.28 A: men and women equally [laughter] 

440.72 446.01 B: yes exactly and they they try to get the next best thing you know which is so sad 

445.88 447.39 A: it is indeed 

446.97 450.11 B: yeah 'cause i i have i have a couple of friends up there 

450.79 456.39 B: that one of them's a really good friend and i i've totally seen a a big change in him 

455.81 456.60 A: [noise] 

456.60 466.68 B: that it well since he moved up there and it's just it you know and he told me he says i'm not going to change i'm not going to uh you know i'm gonna be the same person and we'll keep in touch but 

465.45 466.95 A: (( [noise] oh [noise] )) 

466.51 475.00 B: he just got wrapped up in all that that stuff up there and it just changed him completely and it's just 

467.05 467.84 A: [noise] 

469.05 469.74 A: (( [noise] )) 

474.20 475.09 A: (( that's sad )) 

475.20 476.21 B: sad 

476.09 478.52 A: because [noise] usually not to the better 

478.53 485.73 B: yeah exactly not for the better [laughter] even though they try to say they're not you know they're they're trying to say stay the same thing but 

479.67 480.41 A: [noise] 

485.14 497.29 A: [noise] and then i i i i think that such a deal getting the million losing the friend [noise] uh might trigger such a change once you you i don't know sold your soul in that way uh uh 

497.23 498.21 B: yeah 

497.63 499.75 A: (( for money once [noise] uh i mean uh )) 

499.96 505.88 A: that that might give uh that might open the door for for for more deals of that kind i 

505.16 507.17 B: [noise] right exactly 

506.47 512.85 A: don't know the the longer [noise] i i think about it [noise] and yeah talking about it the the uh less i like that idea [noise] with the million 

512.80 514.08 B: (( right )) 

514.63 516.22 B: (( [noise] hold on a second )) 

516.09 516.68 A: (( mm )) 

518.85 520.06 B: (( yeah like )) 

520.27 522.14 B: (( [laughter] i had someone at the door )) 

521.73 523.07 A: (( oh right [noise] )) 

522.64 528.31 B: (( [laughter] so um ah i was just out there and so uh )) 

529.26 531.66 B: [lipsmack] how many more minutes we got [laughter] 

531.24 533.64 A: oh i i don't know i didn't uh 

534.16 536.39 A: i guess th- three or so 

536.47 538.03 B: okay [laughter] 

537.33 539.20 A: [laughter] 

538.51 542.43 B: (( [laughter] i guess we try to stick it out [laughter] but )) 

541.41 546.32 A: yeah we are almost through with the topic we decided that we well [noise] i decided that i don't want that million [noise] 

546.14 557.15 B: yeah uh uh i i you know i i i agree i i'm happy with um with what i have and uh you know i don't make a lot of money and it's it's i'm satisfied so 

551.88 552.66 A: yeah 

556.82 561.02 A: yeah i- if it's enough for a good bottle of wine once in a while and and and 

560.01 571.63 B: [laughter] and a couple of good trips and uh maybe a couple of nice cars but you know then you gotta pay for the insurance and the gas and the [laughter] and then you got to have this parking money and 

562.41 563.49 A: exactly 

568.60 571.15 A: [laughter] [noise] i'm not that that big a fan of cars [laughter] 

571.67 573.22 A: do you like cars 

571.98 573.09 B: (( so it's so )) 

573.25 574.51 B: what's that
