34.98 37.53 A: not sure if i have a best friend right now 'cause i just 

37.77 41.15 A: [mn] uh this is my first year in college but um

50.91 59.01 A: well i mean i'm just looking at the friends i have here i'm pretty sure i'll be able to fend for myself financially once i get out of college so 

58.79 60.03 B: mhm 

59.04 61.65 A: like money isn't a huge issue to me 

60.76 61.77 B: (( [mn] )) 

61.99 65.19 A: and uh like the other thing is i i don't 

61.99 63.33 B: wow 

65.37 67.18 A: think it would sound really good 

67.33 71.31 A: it it wouldn't be responsible i guess with respect to my friends you know 'cause 

71.38 76.25 A: when you have a friend you sort of have mutual obligations and it feels like i would be betraying him 

75.32 77.92 B: [lipsmack] wow that's interesting 

77.93 78.92 A: what about you 

78.00 78.92 B: me 

78.81 88.74 B: i don't know i think um actually my husband's in in graduate school now so um [laughter] i'm thinking a million bucks that's a lot of money 

88.58 94.32 B: you know and i just think i honestly don't have a best friend like i did have a best friend 

94.44 99.46 B: from like high school all the way up to about five years ago and 

99.74 102.28 B: i don't even know like i i just think 

103.04 109.50 B: i just think every year things change people change um you know the friends that i have today 

109.62 123.90 B: are probably not going to be the best friends that i'm going to have tomorrow and and when i think back like through the years how many actual like 'cause i think they say i don't know what do they say if you're you're lucky if you find one good friend you know and i kind of thought i had that good friend 

123.76 131.79 B: and then i didn't anymore and i don't even know what happened so i don't i think for myself i i distance myself from people 

132.27 146.99 B: i guess just 'cause i felt like i was burned or whatever then i think man a million bucks i could like go anywhere and make a friend [laughter] [laughter] i i guess i don't know i just think that that that things change and i don't think i really would 

133.13 136.60 A: (( mm )) 

140.10 141.70 A: (( mhm well )) 

147.11 148.16 B: put that much 

148.24 150.64 B: stock into having a best friend 

151.01 152.05 B: you know 

152.20 152.99 A: yeah 

153.18 161.41 A: i g- i guess it does really a lot based on personal circumstances i mean if i was in your if i were in your situation and i didn't really have a best friend i'd yeah just no no question about it 

159.61 160.73 B: yeah 

161.11 166.23 B: you know i think and a million dollars that's like a lot of money what are you going to school for 

161.43 161.99 A: (( [sigh] )) 

166.45 174.99 A: ah i don't know like i i'm not sure but i i'm i'm pretty confident that i'll not be starving or anything like that once i'm out [mn] yeah 

167.53 168.29 B: oh 

169.06 170.09 B: mhm 

174.17 183.80 B: so like in general like like just in everyday like is is money not an issue to you like just in your general life then too 

175.35 178.81 A: (( um )) 

181.41 182.10 A: (( it )) 

184.08 187.34 A: well a- at those levels like 

187.95 193.71 A: yeah i've i've j- i i grew up in the suburbs so maybe that's just like a part of like the whole like it depends on 

193.72 196.03 A: your circumstances thing so i wasn't 

196.11 199.14 A: ever like you know really used to not 

199.17 200.37 B: having 

199.30 201.39 A: being yeah 

200.82 209.28 B: see that's interesting then yeah 'cause see like i was brought up like small town um nobody had a lot of money you know what i mean 

209.04 209.96 A: yeah 

209.23 217.33 B: um and money to me seems to be a really big issue 'cause i actually too and i guess it's like my husband 

217.77 222.99 B: i guess that now he's in school but like when he worked he actually worked with food pantry 

223.07 237.71 B: like he worked for like a non-profit organization or whatever so he like would you know give the free food out every month whatever and like he would come home and he would be like we are so lucky you know we have a house we have food we have you know all this stuff 

223.09 223.93 A: mhm 

237.69 251.55 B: and yet i would go to work and i work in a bank and i'd be like you know doing you know jumbo certificates of deposits for customers and stuff like that and i would come home and i'd be like we are so broke you know 

251.32 266.19 B: [laughter] so it was like it it was hard actually to find that kind of in between because i understand i am lucky you know you i do have a roof over my head and i do have food you know the basic things but i've never had a lot of money 

251.40 252.24 A: yeah 

266.30 276.47 B: you know where i could just pick up and take a vacation or you know go go to the mall without thinking how much am i spending you know where is it going to cut into my budget 

266.34 267.36 A: yeah 

276.49 277.66 A: yeah [laughter] 

277.01 281.79 B: i'm just really more money conscious of stuff like that like 

282.02 285.25 B: you know and i guess there's like limitations too 

285.27 288.07 B: you know like acc- accepting a million dollars like 

288.69 291.78 B: um do you remember that movie indecent proposal 

291.94 293.18 A: no i haven't 

292.28 294.65 B: with demi moore and 

294.70 295.53 B: (( [lipsmack] i )) 

295.60 302.18 B: can't even remember who it is but she like they w- they would give them a million dollars if she like slept with this guy 

302.43 307.69 B: that's different you know what i mean like i would never do that but like if i don't i don't think 

302.48 303.68 A: (( uh-huh yeah )) 

307.91 311.80 B: i have connected anybody that it would be worth 

309.00 311.68 A: (( mm )) 

312.20 317.46 B: giving up that million dollars you know what i mean but i guess you see it on t._v. with 

317.51 320.97 B: fear factor and stuff like that do they get money for that 

322.03 323.55 B: i don't even know 

323.73 327.35 A: i assume they get something for i guess wasting their time right 

324.87 325.53 B: (( [mn] )) 

326.73 329.49 B: yeah i mean really like if i had to like 

329.56 334.35 B: eat something that they eat i'd want compensation you know what i mean so 

333.77 334.95 A: yeah [laughter] 

334.36 337.14 B: i guess i guess that you know it is it's really [lipsmack] 

337.59 340.92 B: all how you look at it but yeah if it doesn't like that would be like 

340.97 347.13 B: like i think if it were up to like my husband he probably wouldn't either maybe it's like a gender thing too 

348.07 353.64 A: oh that's that's odd because uh i was under the impression that the stereotype is that girls stick together more than guys [laughter] 

353.08 356.49 B: really see i i think women are more catty 

357.00 357.72 A: (( oh )) 

357.07 358.90 B: you know i think we like 

359.17 361.50 B: pick over like little things 

362.05 369.38 B: whereas like i think guys i think they get a friend and they like keep that group of friends or whatever you know what i mean 

369.20 370.12 A: yeah 

369.59 375.44 B: i don't know i guess it's just it's different i yeah i think women i think we go through more friends 

375.68 376.73 B: just 'cause 

376.80 380.53 B: i think women if you're not in the same place 

380.71 383.30 B: in life you know what i mean 

382.32 382.91 A: (( mhm )) 

383.41 384.34 A: yeah 

383.44 386.89 B: like it changes like now like i lost my friend 

387.17 395.66 B: um because now you know well because then i had gotten married and she of course was still single so it's a different way of life 

395.55 396.53 A: yeah 

395.97 398.63 B: and you know that my friends that i have now 

398.67 403.32 B: you know are like different friends than i had a year ago because i had a baby 

404.07 404.98 B: so 

405.00 409.12 B: i think just life circumstances for women change more 

409.52 410.59 B: (( i don't know )) 

409.68 410.58 A: (( yeah )) 

410.59 421.65 A: i guess yeah if i were in your situation i'd probably choose the same thing you would but i i mean back back when you were still in your late teens or early twenties would you have done would you have chosen the same thing 

421.04 425.03 B: see i don't know i don't think i could put myself back in that spot 

425.11 426.33 B: (( you know what i mean )) 

425.44 427.25 A: yeah yeah 

426.56 427.61 B: um 

428.12 430.30 B: i wanna say no but then again 

430.41 431.18 B: my 

431.32 439.31 B: life situation was different too you know what i mean like i was thinking always for the future i think money always was a big issue to me though 

439.38 440.60 B: (( i don't know )) 

440.63 443.73 B: i have to say it it really always has been an issue 

443.78 451.23 B: you know just 'cause i've always wanted more i've wanted that money security you know i think that's i 

451.47 455.70 B: put them two together money and security if i have money then i'm i'm okay 

456.21 460.79 B: you know it's i don't know it's different but i meet like a lot of people that 

460.98 462.58 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

461.70 468.16 B: money really isn't the you know they live paycheck to paycheck and they don't any money in the bank and they don't save for a rainy day 

468.42 470.75 B: i just can't imagine living like that 

470.61 472.16 A: definitely [noise] 

471.79 472.81 B: (( you know )) 

473.16 474.92 B: i think um 

475.49 481.81 B: yeah i don't know i i mean can you imagine somebody offering that to you though you don't think you'd have a second doubt 

482.95 484.25 A: no not at all 

484.00 487.19 B: really that totally intrigues me 

487.59 490.94 B: i g- yeah i guess it's just different for different people 

488.12 493.78 A: (( um )) 

491.03 492.12 B: but um 

492.31 495.05 B: that's interesting have you called in before 

496.01 499.39 A: let's see i called in yesterday or the day before 

497.93 498.58 B: w- 

499.04 500.97 B: what was yester- what was that 

500.92 504.33 A: it was terrible something about starting your own business 

504.08 505.39 B: oh 

504.91 510.63 A: and both of us like just had no inclination to do that whatsoever so we just spent half of it talking about how 

510.71 511.43 A: (( was is )) 

511.28 513.12 B: oh [laughter] 

513.39 515.95 A: this your uh first second third time

517.17 518.05 A: oh wow 

522.25 525.21 B: and oh the other one was sports 

525.57 530.98 B: you know which i was like totally like it was like what do you think about professional sports and stuff like that

530.88 532.05 A: (( that yeah )) 

531.50 539.14 B: that was like interesting i think actually it was different like both times i talked with a woman and then i talked with a man 

539.50 540.48 B: um 

540.90 545.59 B: but i think you know with the women i kind of agreed with the man i seemed to disagree 

546.57 549.83 A: mhm well i guess this uh just continues the trend [laughter] 

549.46 555.64 B: yeah that's that's you know interesting wow so you're in your first year of college 

555.46 556.64 A: yeah
