2.36 4.35 B: hi this is sally 

4.48 6.80 A: hi this is brandon 

8.38 10.19 B: so what do you think of the question 

10.55 11.48 A: (( what are )) 

11.42 12.33 B: yeah 

12.64 13.82 A: the question 

13.81 14.71 B: uh-huh 

14.18 22.64 A: i really don't think there's anything wrong with the public school since i grew up going to public schools for for twelfth junior year and twelfth grade 

22.87 24.24 A: and i feel that 

24.40 29.09 A: they're very good in educating people and there's lot of opportunities 

29.40 31.34 A: for education and 

31.76 45.01 A: i feel that i've done better in education than any of my friends that went to the archdiocese there they have more um technology is more up to date than any other kind of particular school 

45.38 48.10 A: both private and public uh catholic 

49.15 54.28 B: i went to public schools too but i really don't didn't know anybody who went to private schools to compare it to 

54.26 55.83 A: yeah i think 

54.81 55.59 B: but 

56.05 56.81 B: (( what )) 

56.65 62.39 A: the pub- public school i went to it it was a really big public school but so uh there it was the 

62.55 68.65 A: teachers were much more knowledgeable in what they taught and like they actually cared 

68.22 70.10 B: right i went to a big public school 

70.35 71.18 A: (( yes )) 

70.89 77.33 B: too the only concern i have nowadays is i'm a mom and i worry about all the violence in schools 

77.27 81.92 A: well i think that public schools are more like the teachers are more um 

82.52 88.26 A: knowledgeable in how to stop um violence in schools like there's all counsellors there 

88.58 92.81 A: always available more than in a catholic school environment 

93.24 98.08 A: and even though that they say that public schools are worse it's not really that bad 

98.53 103.07 A: i grew up in a like an outer right outside of philadelphia and it wasn't that bad 

103.77 104.88 B: where did you grow up 

105.02 106.54 A: (( i )) 

106.13 107.00 B: okay 

108.29 115.00 B: [cough] i don't know i guess it's 'cause that they're more aware but you know i'm i'm quite a bit older than you i imagine i'm forty one 

115.08 120.06 B: and when i went to school we didn't have to worry about anything like that and it's just kinda scary nowadays 

120.39 125.91 A: think most of it is all just talk that public schools are that bad more than anything else 

127.05 130.72 A: um if anything does happen i think public schools are more 

130.95 134.79 A: they're more capable of stopping anything than in a catholic school 

135.24 141.61 B: i think you're right i think they are better equipped just because they're more aware and they do have larger personnel 

139.04 140.28 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

141.75 143.14 B: [noise] 

146.38 147.32 A: but 

147.81 152.70 B: i heard some talk around here that they're talking about going to uniforms for public schools what do you think about that 

151.73 159.52 A: yeah my my public school is they just changed it right after the year i graduated they started doing uniforms but but 

159.79 166.69 A: i never experienced having to wear a uniform so i really can't say but i don't think that they should um 

167.05 174.44 A: it'd be trying to change it more to like a catholic school setting than anything else 'cause people go to public schools 'cause they can't afford stuff like that 

174.61 175.66 B: that's true 

176.10 182.67 A: even if it is cheap but still people have to buy school clothes and then clothes they're not gonna wear those clothes out 

182.27 183.39 B: that's true 

183.80 185.88 B: in some ways i think it's a good idea 

186.09 187.87 B: just because everyone's the same 

188.19 193.12 B: but then you lose lose your individuality and that is a good point about having to buy two sets of clothes 

188.53 189.42 A: but 

193.08 205.29 A: yeah once you have to wear it's like conforming to one thing you lose your individuality and expressing yourself more but then you also cut down on dress code policies like midriff and stuff like that 

204.61 205.71 B: that's true 

205.74 208.97 A: 'cause we had a big problem with that in my high school but 

208.08 208.98 B: (( did you )) 

209.98 215.03 B: see my son is just getting ready to start high school next year so i'll be more informed next year [laughter] 

210.20 211.12 A: (( one way )) 

214.82 215.73 A: (( right )) 

216.25 216.81 B: (( [sigh] )) 

218.79 223.06 A: i wouldn't if i had to wear i wouldn't wear one in high school because 

223.55 228.61 A: i just couldn't i wouldn't want to have that and then have to get ano- more clothes to buy 

228.78 230.60 A: it'd be too costly 

230.64 232.07 B: that makes sense 

232.08 232.91 A: (( right )) 

232.62 235.01 B: i think that's true for a lot of people 

235.36 238.75 A: 'cause that's why they go to public school 'cause they can't afford 

238.88 245.36 A: some most people go to public school 'cause they can't afford any other type of education never mind buy more clothes for their kids 

245.42 246.88 B: that's very true 

247.31 249.00 A: (( but )) 

249.09 251.76 A: since they did it i guess they have to do it now 

251.78 256.02 B: yeah i wonder i bet the kids aren't accepting it very well do you know 

256.23 257.24 A: um 

257.32 263.76 A: i don't well the dress code they had at my high school wasn't that bad it was just like a polo shirt and khakis 

263.21 264.46 B: mhm 

263.80 266.97 A: and it could be any polo shirt as long as it was clean 

265.31 266.21 B: okay 

266.60 268.32 B: well that's not too bad 

267.72 271.20 A: (( it's not like it has a school logo on there or anything and )) 

271.23 272.92 A: you can wear sneakers 

273.99 274.95 B: well that wouldn't 

274.16 275.07 A: so i guess 

276.06 278.29 B: that wouldn't be too bad not too strict 

278.26 281.44 A: nuh but it's still extra stuff you have to buy 

280.84 281.94 B: that's true 

282.54 287.48 A: but i don't i don't know what they would do if they didn't wear it i think you get 

287.56 290.17 A: (( punishment for it otherwise )) 

289.07 289.83 B: mhm 

291.45 294.94 B: yeah i wonder how they enforce it like if they send the kids home or what 

293.28 294.17 A: yeah 

295.16 301.54 A: they might have like stuff there that they make them change into or go home to get changed and then come back and 

301.61 306.32 A: if it happens more than one time then they could suspension or something 

304.73 305.98 B: yeah 

306.70 310.84 B: did you see the thing um about the girls in chicago with the hazing incident 

310.34 313.55 A: like that yeah that made me sick 

311.49 312.77 B: wasn't that awful 

313.33 316.03 B: that was just i couldn't believe they allow that to happen 

315.98 320.00 A: well actually in that stuff none none of that happened at like my high school which was 

320.13 322.52 A: like just regular stuff like 

322.82 327.82 A: just the paint would be fun but beating them up and everything was just taking it too far 

327.59 332.11 B: oh i agree i mean we had a powder puff football game and that's all it was was a football game 

332.08 332.95 A: yeah 

333.75 340.46 A: we have we had powder puff too and it was they just did a they never had anything after it like a hazing or anything 

339.78 340.75 B: no 

340.76 342.19 A: (( and so but )) 

340.84 341.50 B: i 

343.88 347.29 A: still it's not that bad like ripping piercings out and stuff 

346.93 349.17 B: right i mean that was awful 

349.24 350.48 A: extreme 

351.58 356.06 A: and then watching the people's reactions like oh they just got beat up deal with it 

356.10 357.27 B: yeah 

357.22 358.65 A: that's kind of 

358.92 361.60 A: to think the schools are actually like that 

362.71 363.99 A: (( but )) 

363.37 367.50 B: and i can't imagine thinking that it's okay to to act that way 

367.27 372.72 A: that's they think it's okay that's the sad part about it they don't find a problem with it and to 

369.71 370.86 B: i know 

373.20 375.30 A: think that people think that way is 

375.43 377.46 B: it's pretty scary isn't it 

376.82 377.96 A: yeah 

378.51 385.25 A: but i i don't think i think that would happen at either that didn't have anything to do with if it was a public school or not 

385.13 386.71 B: oh no i don't think so 

385.46 386.72 A: (( it was the )) 

387.02 393.47 A: the pe- the people who were there and whether there were any catholic schools it still would of happened 'cause it was still out of school they 

393.03 395.59 B: right and they said it wasn't even on school grounds 

395.35 398.35 A: (( said if it was on the school grounds it probably wouldn't of happened )) 

396.55 397.47 B: was it 

398.43 403.50 B: i agree and i i think it should be on school ground you know it's a school related activity 

403.25 413.22 A: mhm because when we had a all our games that we had either had like security guards there or police from our town set would be there to keep uh people 

414.64 417.01 A: (( out of get rowdy )) 

416.81 417.75 B: right 

418.75 419.49 A: (( but )) 

421.23 423.72 A: tha- that was just gross watching them 

423.73 430.42 A: and then hear- hearing people getting what happened to them like one girl got a bacteria bacterial infection 

431.80 435.68 A: from having something i forget what it was but 

442.39 443.18 A: (( um )) 

443.18 443.88 B: (( mm [laughter] mm )) 

446.22 447.02 A: (( uh )) 

447.68 448.47 A: but 

450.04 460.53 A: i definitely think that there's more opportunities at public schools like extra like advanced placement classes and more they have more more a variety of classes to pick to from 

461.33 469.45 A: i think if anything they should change the catholic school 'cause the curriculum curriculum is a lot easier at catholic schools than public schools 

468.99 470.02 B: is it really 

469.95 471.16 A: (( yeah like )) 

470.52 472.90 B: i was always under the impression it was more difficult 

472.75 480.92 A: no it's a lot easier like the stuff they teach is at a way much lower level like at public schools they have like different of classes 

480.42 481.15 B: mhm 

481.10 486.29 A: like you have like the lower classes and you have like the advanced placement and honors classes and 

485.65 486.60 B: right 

486.36 490.05 A: that's more like college based like stuff you're doing like 

490.17 494.34 A: some of the stuff i'm doing in college now is a lot easier than my high school stuff 

493.76 494.64 B: wow 

494.87 495.75 A: and 

496.40 497.47 A: um 

497.59 503.17 A: also like at public school you get a tick if you want to do art or if you want to do like music class and 

503.39 507.99 A: like you can do like workshop and that you can't do that at catholic or any other school 

508.25 511.30 A: you have more variety and opportunities to 

512.07 517.52 B: i know and i um chose to go to vocational school which obviously i couldn't of done if i went to a private school 

517.62 518.34 A: mhm 

518.28 523.78 B: yeah my um ex-husband is thinking about sending my daughter to a private school next year and 

523.79 527.69 B: i'm not real thrilled with the idea but i guess i'm willing to give it a try 

528.45 535.72 A: i think the the one main thing that with private and um catholic schools really care about is sports too 

535.69 536.33 B: (( mm )) 

535.79 537.56 A: they're big on sport 

537.58 539.48 A: more than education so 

539.49 541.24 B: (( well that's not good mm )) 

539.80 540.76 A: i went 

540.91 546.96 A: i went to a catholic school for a couple months and then decided i wanted to go back to public school and it was just 

547.81 556.49 A: i don't know it was more beneficial if you wanted to go to college 'cause counsellors work with you more one on one and helping you get in and stuff like that 

557.56 558.88 B: well that's good to know 

558.76 559.89 A: yeah 

561.01 562.46 A: there's more um 

562.81 564.11 A: better like 

564.58 571.14 A: programs to help you get into college and there's more classes to help you learn how to study and stuff like that 

572.26 573.43 A: (( public schools )) 

573.72 574.41 B: hm 

575.08 579.17 A: (( the only thing i would change i don't think i would change anything with public school 'cause )) 

580.35 582.35 A: i think it's fine the way they are 

582.34 586.08 B: i think the only problem is that some public schools the classes are too big 

586.78 597.07 A: i i was in the the public school i went to was the biggest one in like on the ea- like dover county is i think i graduated with like twelve hundred kids 

596.40 598.44 B: wow that's even bigger than mine 

598.10 599.89 A: yeah 'cause the the high school
