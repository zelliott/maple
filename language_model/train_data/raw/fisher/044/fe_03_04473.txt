69.27 73.73 B: mm okay so the u._s. public school system um 

70.48 71.67 A: [laughter] 

73.87 75.57 B: basically 

75.58 80.72 B: i think that every state should be like new york and have regent's exams 

80.64 81.94 A: really 

81.99 84.34 B: yeah um 

82.74 84.00 A: wow 

84.79 90.46 B: 'cause i think that the kids are graduating from each class and they have no idea what they're doing 

90.34 93.59 A: oh yeah i definitely agree um 

94.14 98.37 A: i think i don't know i know we're having in florida a huge problem with the s. c._a._t.s 

98.97 100.61 B: oh yeah 

99.42 110.88 A: a seriously huge problem because all the kids are failing but you know what are we going to do just keep failing the kids because then we're not going to have anybody graduating but yet 

103.83 105.02 B: [laughter] 

109.79 117.36 B: my understanding of the s. c._a._t.s was that that was of for a rating of the school not for a rating of the student am i wrong 

117.11 122.96 A: yeah it's the rating of the school and then the that depends that determines how much funding they get 

122.93 127.71 B: right but i but i thought the students' identities were actually kept anonymous 

123.42 124.69 A: yeah 

127.90 131.45 A: i didn't think so 'cause of they send us the results and everything 

131.79 134.92 A: you know like they post the results for us 

134.30 147.80 B: oh really huh well well or not even so much that they're kept anonymous but that it doesn't really matter you know what i mean like the kid and and and i that's definitely part of the problem i mean if it doesn't matter the kids are just going to christmas tree it 

134.99 136.19 A: yeah 

139.49 141.42 A: yeah yeah 

147.22 150.82 A: yeah exactly they don't care about it 

150.44 156.31 B: where you know if it's like the regent's exams in new york i mean if you fail it you fail the class 

155.68 167.45 A: yeah that's i really i don't def- i don't disagree i just think wow i don't know you know been in a foreign school all my life i see how it is it is this 

167.82 177.92 A: it's not necessarily challenging you have your one or two you know classes that made a difference that you remember why you're in college but other than that you know
