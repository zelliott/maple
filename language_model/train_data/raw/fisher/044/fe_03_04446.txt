65.03 65.98 B: (( right on )) 

73.88 83.58 A: they were shutting it because uh it had just eroded its value the students were and the failure failure rate was phenomenal 

83.69 95.85 A: and and the city was having a budget crisis so they told uh decided to shut that school [lipsmack] and in my days um you know it was one of the premier public schools in the city 

95.79 96.64 B: (( right on )) 

95.89 98.91 A: (( it was a um [lipsmack] you know gateway )) 

99.02 102.70 A: everybody went to college from the public school and it was wonderful 

102.84 104.34 A: so you see how 

104.40 106.54 A: times have changed [laughter] 

106.05 114.45 B: very cool that's good for you i only actually attended a public school for two years i went to a private school for my first eight and my 

106.91 108.30 A: yeah 

111.28 111.84 A: (( [mn] )) 

113.53 114.45 A: mhm 

114.58 117.37 B: for my first uh ten years actually 

117.01 117.88 A: uh-huh 

117.54 127.78 B: i went to a um private school and then when i transferred i transferred to the public high school for my uh sen- junior and senior year and 

126.93 127.82 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

127.74 141.73 B: when i uh graduate- when i transferred from my private school i was ahead of everybody i was ahead of the graduating seniors when i entered the public school uh the private school that i attended had a much um 

137.29 138.19 A: uh-huh 

142.16 152.00 B: quicker pace of learning and a much um strin- more stringent uh curriculum we had uh what would be a harder curriculum than public school in our area 

143.73 144.65 A: right 

151.61 152.50 A: right 

152.37 164.42 B: and uh when i attended the public school i actually my eleventh i technically graduated uh the day that i entered the public school 'cause i had all of my credits to pass the public 

159.09 159.66 A: (( [noise] )) 

164.31 167.83 B: high school on it uh when i uh 

165.02 165.89 A: uh-huh 

167.85 178.15 B: first began and i ended up taking nothing but art and gym classes for the final two years of school so i had a total breeze my final two years of school because of that um 

171.23 172.32 A: oh wow 

172.45 173.66 A: yeah 

175.94 176.84 A: mhm 

178.46 188.30 B: also like our public school uh where i'm from i'm originally from altuna pennsylvania and there is one single public high school there 

183.70 184.61 A: (( mhm )) 

187.75 188.77 A: oh wow 

188.50 200.68 B: so it's kind of a crazy thing there's what i didn't like about that in particular was that i graduated with three thousand students my graduating class was thirty seven hundred people 

197.14 198.05 A: uh-huh 

200.07 201.38 A: oh my goodness 

200.79 203.52 B: and each of you were a number 

202.98 204.08 A: right 

203.62 208.46 B: so i had i went from extreme personal uh care and 

207.60 209.35 A: [laughter] to none 

208.96 219.62 B: to none yes i went from everybody knew my name to no one knew who i was and i found that i enjoyed i can say that i enjoyed the public schooling 'cause it was so easy for me 

209.72 210.88 A: (( uh-huh [noise] )) 

219.55 227.51 B: but i didn't learn anything in a public school so that is my experience of public schooling [laughter] yeah i learned how to water paint 

225.08 226.07 A: uh-huh 

227.50 233.44 A: yeah well like i said my experience was a very positive one but you know school has changed 

233.57 235.57 A: so much since i went to school 

235.65 238.57 A: uh and the public schools just are um 

238.74 240.55 A: they have to deal with so many 

241.16 244.67 A: issues these days it's yeah and they just have to 

242.60 243.79 B: oh yes 

244.79 258.11 A: cater to everybody and everybody's whims and the the budget crises that are going on and uh you know equal opportunity for everybody and uh disabilities and and that sort of thing it just has to be a nightmare to 

258.37 262.23 A: to uh run a public school let alone be in one 

261.87 269.45 B: yeah i really i i personally like what's going on in the news today i don't really think the public schools aside from the lack of funding 

269.61 276.59 B: i don't think the public schools are really that bad or to blame for anything i think it's the parenting that's to blame 

276.27 277.35 A: yeah that's 

276.50 290.78 B: you know like these kids come in there and they don't wanna do anything but what is a teacher to do when you can't you have no form of punishment you can't kick 'em out of school because you're jeopardizing their education which is against their constitutional right 

283.83 284.93 A: mhm 

288.21 289.28 A: right 

289.79 290.63 A: right 

291.16 297.32 B: so i think like public schools have worked themselves into kind of a hand tied kinda situation 

297.78 302.57 A: yeah 'cause private schools have a little more leeway in who they select number one 

302.24 303.13 B: uh-huh 

302.78 306.61 A: uh and the rules under which they operate aren't 

306.63 311.61 A: quite as stringent for uh public schools but i generally agree with you 

311.36 314.47 B: now is your in in texas do they do vouchering 

314.67 316.30 A: no they do not 

315.45 319.24 B: like here in pennsylvania we started doing vouchering where you 

319.39 326.18 B: as a non like um where i grew up all our schools were uh all the private schools were religious based 

325.58 326.87 A: (( right )) 

326.24 329.08 B: so what they're doing now is they're allowing 

329.48 337.08 B: children that aren't religious based to get outta the public system to go to the private schools and they get tax break vouchers 

336.79 338.89 A: no they don't do that here in texas 

337.87 343.16 B: so they're giving 'em break tax breaks to send them to p- to private school 

342.83 343.77 A: mhm 

343.18 349.51 B: and now there's there's public school kids ending up in private schools and now the private schools are tending to have a few 

349.54 354.53 B: um disciplinary problems with the same kids that came from the private schools 

354.20 361.60 A: [lipsmack] yeah no they they haven't got that in texas the big issue now is funding for schools um the way the 

361.60 370.91 A: tax basis structure in the school districts uh school districts are independent of um you know cities or whatever they have their own boundaries 

370.77 373.16 B: yeah they become their own government 

370.95 371.71 A: and 

372.61 381.28 A: uh essentially and uh they're they're autonomous and yet [cough] in texas there is uh something called a robin hood uh law 

381.32 391.01 A: where you know the larger more um wealthy districts have to give some of their tax money to the poor districts and the state 

384.63 386.45 B: mhm 

391.08 399.58 A: and it's created a a big controversy and the legislators are trying to deal with that and and change it but um uh it's just a mess 

399.21 403.42 B: yeah it's kinda like internal state socialism 

401.92 402.99 A: mhm 

403.00 414.96 A: [lipsmack] yeah and uh the other issue here with public schools well i guess any schools but primary public schools is the uh use of standardized testing throughout um 

415.02 416.78 A: the education system 

416.09 418.90 B: 'cause you have a lot of minorities 

418.35 433.30 A: uh yeah but just the whole you know to try to improve schools uh they instituted uh what they call task test textures achievement something tests for students and they have to pass them to graduate or pass them to get promoted 

431.52 432.26 B: (( [cough] )) 

433.44 434.45 B: yep 

433.50 443.03 A: and i i think they start taking them in the fourth grade and then the sixth and seventh and ninth and so on and it was just meant to improve the uh 

443.09 447.79 A: the educational level i'm not sure it has other than create a lot of more testing 

447.95 456.11 B: hm we took we took standardized tests like that also but i think ours were just to rank us in our classes and to distinguish 

451.65 452.81 A: mhm 

454.74 455.49 A: (( oh )) 

456.03 456.98 A: yeah 

456.20 459.23 B: where we were on the food chain of education 

457.91 458.89 A: mhm 

459.52 470.74 A: so um but the schools there's so many society issues that uh just creep into the schools that make it very very difficult and the budgeting is one issue but 

470.73 476.68 A: you know all the uh societal issues of um drugs and and 

476.82 482.78 A: um violence and yeah i certainly wouldn't want to teach in a high school right now 

477.17 478.11 B: violence 

482.62 490.16 B: oh i wouldn't i i actually attended college for education and um part of of my plan here was 

485.44 487.08 A: (( mm )) 

490.21 496.45 B: i got grants from the state of pennsylvania and if i taught in pennsylvania in one of the schools that they chose for me 

496.20 497.08 A: uh-huh 

496.28 500.00 B: then they would pay off the grants well i actually had to re- 

499.80 514.42 B: refuse where they wanted to put me they wanted to put me in a school in philadelphia which when i started checking into the school with other people i knew from philadelphia it is the worst school in pennsylvania [laughter] you're dealing with 

504.59 506.18 A: mhm 

512.65 514.07 A: yeah right 

514.27 521.79 B: uh very very impoverished very under educated inner city kids that have no problem with cutting you 

521.48 522.66 A: mhm 

521.68 534.75 B: if they don't get what they expected on a test so i actually went the easy route and paid the debt [laughter] as opposed to getting cut 'cause i gave someone a c. [laughter] 

523.38 524.31 A: right 

529.63 530.47 A: yeah 

532.04 538.33 A: uh-huh [laughter] right i don't know what the what the answer is i'm not sure there's any one answer 

538.23 546.01 B: i think i think its part of the the major national problem of there's too many hands in the pot 

538.37 539.16 A: but 

545.67 547.56 A: yes you're probably right 

546.85 555.03 B: you know there's too many too many heads making too many decisions for people that aren't informed about what decisions are being made for them 

554.40 556.21 A: y- yeah that's true 

555.82 563.56 B: i think our government is like that on the national level right now i mean a fine example is this whole ordeal in the middle east 

563.44 575.98 B: you know we had lots of supporters of the war and we had a lot of people against the war that spoke out and were chastised for speaking out when that's their first amendment rights to the freedom of speech 

571.81 572.82 A: (( uh-huh )) 

574.14 575.40 A: right 

575.95 581.71 B: you know and when you disagree with you you have every right to disagree with the president the congress 

581.71 591.41 B: what have you if people go to war you don't necessarily have to support the war you have to support the people out there risking their lives for your freedom 

591.33 592.26 A: right 

592.14 599.95 B: like you don't have to support that i think i think this public school system is just simply you know something that's been let go for so long
