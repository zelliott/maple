13.60 15.19 B: oh i live in brooklyn 

14.85 18.84 A: oh okay yes ah we we know the schools are bad here 

15.39 16.77 B: [laughter] 

17.44 23.14 B: oh yes we know there's something terribly wrong with the school system [laughter] 

21.53 25.20 A: yeah i ha- have you been in are you are you from new york originally 

24.45 28.07 B: [cough] well ah originally i grew up in connecticut 

27.85 28.75 A: (( aha )) 

28.33 32.64 B: and i moved here when i was thirteen and i'm forty seven now 

32.17 33.42 A: okay 

32.94 40.39 B: and my experience with moving from connecticut public schools to brooklyn's was a nightmare 

40.57 45.74 B: i was so far ahead of the the school system back then 

46.02 53.21 B: that i virtually had to do no work for numerous years and i just couldn't believe 

53.49 55.44 B: (( the new york city school system )) 

56.31 61.17 A: but you stayed you just stayed in and graduated but you it just made you very lazy [laughter] no 

58.80 59.87 B: (( yeah )) 

60.45 72.85 B: well not lazy just frustrated because i felt like i wasn't ever going to learn anything ever again [laughter] um you know the school systems are just so different when you when you're outside of new york 

72.73 78.01 A: well yeah and plus i mean new york i mean i'm from ohio originally so i didn't come here till after i finished college 

77.35 79.13 B: well so we have that in common 

78.64 79.72 A: but um 

79.59 91.71 A: but i didn't but i even with you know watching kid- people my friends who have kids trying to figure out where and what schools they're supposed to go to and how you have to sort of apply for them to go to different schools and 

91.11 92.21 B: right 

91.57 95.08 A: it seems very strange to me i don't really understand how it works 

95.46 100.56 B: um just the quality of school care here i mean i was watching a show today 

100.79 110.68 B: and i i have a fractured ankle so i haven't been doing much of anything and they were showing eight year olds that stabbed the principal's leg with a pencil 

104.34 105.27 A: right 

110.79 113.94 A: oh yeah oh my goodness they stabbed he had stabbed him 

113.95 124.24 B: yeah the kid was it was being punished and he was being taken to the principal's office and the kid leaned over and took his pencil and just stabbed the teacher and the principal in the leg with a pencil 

123.91 124.63 A: (( mm )) 

124.33 130.31 B: [mn] i mean i'm appalled at what i hear goes on and now it just seems to be younger and younger 

130.47 144.84 A: yeah but i think that at least having i don't know whether what what they're trying to do now but at least having like a curriculum that's consistent throughout the schools i think that's a good idea you know that's what the the new guy is trying to do now do you like do you think that's smart 

142.28 143.37 B: right but 

145.02 155.00 B: um i think that would be a good idea because no matter what school you're going to at least you know your child's gonna have the same education that every other child has 

154.43 167.14 A: right yeah it seems that at least it's consistent and that not that i think the regents exams are necessarily the greatest thing 'cause too often you just end up studying for exams i think instead of just getting a general education and learning how to think 

166.66 167.67 B: right 

167.56 177.76 A: but at least you know their at least it's sort of standardized throughout the system and as you said everybody knows that their kid is getting so hopefully getting the same education as 

176.48 185.65 B: right whether you you don't live if you don't live in a good neighborhood hopefully your child but you know wha- what are they learning because you just see so much 

185.55 191.67 B: problems with just controlling the kids in the classrooms and then the kids that are there to learn 

191.72 196.26 B: how much can they learn with constant disruptions going on in the classrooms 

195.84 204.69 A: yeah i don't i don't know if it has to be very rough now you know it was i mean i'm i'm forty two so i'm not that much younger than you are so but it you know 

202.59 203.58 B: yeah 

205.00 216.69 A: even even you know with pretty good kids if you you know once one kid is sort of rowdy a classroom could get away from you very quickly and i think maybe that's what's happened is that there's too much babysitting 

216.13 217.94 B: yeah i think so 

217.48 224.59 A: and um so that's that's very difficult but i think we have a responsibility and i think it's really sad 'cause 

224.44 238.49 A: so many other countries are apparently doing better than we are in the in education which is very scary really because you know we need to have you know what like they say that's our future kids are our future and education is very important 

237.91 247.57 B: well that's that's frightening [laughter] kids are the future but yeah you know at what cost and now we have the budget cuts and they want to 

240.29 242.29 A: [laughter] 

247.65 249.34 B: they want to um 

249.57 254.28 B: fire a lot of carers and teachers aides and i know my sister's a carer 

254.26 255.36 A: yes 

254.74 258.79 B: and uh it's a very difficult job and you know 

258.82 265.30 B: you want to educate the children but financially i mean i don't think the books are up to date 

266.40 279.90 A: yeah but i i'm i'm very i would be very curious to see 'cause i just it's just very scary i was doing i did some reading in one of the schools up here but i think it's a pretty good school on ninety sixth street and i had a mixed you know a mixed um 

280.91 295.76 A: student body but it did seem like it would had um you know we had i don't know it just seemed to have like a little more help with the reading and stuff like that so i don't know how how you adjust to that but as you say the books were sort of out of date and um 

294.13 295.09 B: right 

296.49 301.73 A: i don't know it it's very bad but i think that we have to really put money into it i think that's 

300.99 302.80 B: that's the key money 

302.25 313.53 A: that i think that you know you have to really put it on the top of the list and say that it's important instead of firing these people and taking that out of the budget and spending eighty billion dollars on war somewhere else 

313.10 322.81 B: yeah and i heard you know that they were going to make education a top priority and as soon as we get into financial problems what's the first thing they're going to cut education 

322.42 323.67 A: right 

323.07 324.85 B: that's so ludicrous 

324.45 327.74 A: that it really be it really is i don't know what's going on 

327.49 335.35 B: um and i'm i'm sure it must be i i feel coming moving from a different state back way back then 

335.47 341.78 B: that you know children are getting better educations in in suburbia 

342.47 344.36 A: well yeah i mean it and um 

343.42 348.42 B: i mean they still have the same kind of problems i mean there's still drugs no matter where you go 

347.69 349.12 A: right 

348.78 350.03 B: i mean um 

349.99 355.93 A: that would i mean you know there was pot certainly when i was at school and i don't know what they're doing now sniffing glue 

353.29 354.15 B: (( oh )) 

354.65 357.84 B: you know i saw more drugs in 

358.14 365.00 B: the girls' bathrooms when i was in suburbia than i did when i came to brooklyn [laughter] 

360.88 361.98 A: [laughter] 

362.81 372.26 A: right you see yeah maybe they had a little more money or just just under cover i don't know what it is it's just one of those things but you know tha- that's 

367.11 369.10 B: [laughter] 

369.77 370.51 B: oh 

372.29 379.48 A: we we really have to just pay i don't know there has to be some more attention paid to it i think and i think that the money has to be there 

379.28 391.10 A: and i think parents have to get involved too i mean i know that you know my parents moved where they lived just simply 'cause that's where they had the best schools to go to i mean and i think a lot of people do do that they move to places for schools 

391.00 398.04 A: but i mean still i think that you know every place in america you should have get a decent education it's just it shouldn't be necessary 

398.09 406.07 B: and and i think a lot of kids that are graduating just don't have a grasp on simple concepts like reading 

398.10 398.93 A: that 

406.65 412.16 B: reading you know reading is to me the way i was brought up reading was the key to everything 

411.77 413.05 A: right 

412.79 418.18 B: and you know i'm really grateful that my parents instilled that in me when i was a child 

417.77 428.35 A: well i hope people aren't out here getting graduating from high school without being able to read i just don't want to think that's going on i'm sure it is but i mean that's just really sad 

428.24 442.49 B: very sad and i i'm i have a friend that lives in the house and he's having trouble in la guardia college and there he he can't get past the entrance exam for the math and now they're talking about just 

442.60 448.11 B: letting him go through without that as a requirement 

448.46 455.09 B: and just he wants to be a vet tech and so this they're all going to get together and see if they can't just 

455.74 462.61 B: exclude him from having to take this requirement and move on to his other classes and i was appalled 

463.18 468.35 B: i really was i said you know if this really happens i'm going to feel compelled to write a letter to somebody 

467.78 469.34 A: [laughter] 

468.59 471.37 B: because that really makes a mockery out of college 

470.74 476.45 A: yeah it does i mean 'cause people need to you know you need to have the skills that you're supposed to have in order to 

476.53 479.88 A: to be certified otherwise you shouldn't be certified to 

478.95 485.32 B: yeah and and even though the the math has absolutely nothing to do with his career choice 

484.74 485.89 A: right 

486.12 489.81 B: it to me it how does you know 

490.01 500.06 B: it's just so unfair for everybody else that goes to college and they have to struggle through courses that also have nothing to do with their degree or what they're going to be doing in the field 

500.30 503.63 B: and and you know they worked their tails off 

503.79 504.94 A: yeah it's 

504.23 511.57 B: and having to pass classes that they're not going to need either but they have to do it now how can you make an exemption for somebody 

512.01 517.30 B: that that is just so unfair and i can't even believe i i'll tell you another example 

517.40 519.87 B: my uh foster sister 

520.36 534.23 B: wanted to go back and get her g._e._d. and she went to a class once it was over here head and kingsborough called her like two months later and told her she could come pick up her degree all she had to do was pay money 

525.37 526.53 A: mhm 

534.77 536.66 A: oh that's crazy 

536.52 544.53 B: so here they were offering her g._e._d. on on a silver platter with no work put into it as long as she paid the money it was there for the taking 

544.95 546.83 A: that's horrible 

546.16 550.72 B: see so these are the kind of things i hear about school and i go oh my god 

550.69 553.93 A: yeah see that's i mean that that definitely shouldn't happen 

551.90 552.81 B: (( [cough] )) 

553.96 559.75 A: that that could be well do i guess it wasn't a scale it was someone just making money off the books or what 

559.44 564.14 B: that was somebody making money i don't even know if the school system knew about it 

561.47 562.34 A: that's 

563.42 564.83 A: right 

564.32 565.23 B: (( [cough] )) 

565.29 571.97 B: but these are the kind of stories i hear and i go oh my lord if that's available to people you know why bother putting in the work 

571.49 585.03 A: yeah well i i hope that i mean i just hope that now they're trying to do better i mean i think that the school boards were just you know political lackeys who are getting paid off and so that you know they're just making money to do nothing or whatever so that 

579.04 580.70 B: oh definitely 

583.87 587.93 B: yeah and and that kind of situate- situation it was more who you knew 

587.50 599.89 A: right so that's that's just you know the city government we see the governments do it some little bit of changes in the school system which i hope will be good and that i mean like i said the testing at least people are
