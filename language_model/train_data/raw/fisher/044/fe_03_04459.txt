1.33 2.62 A: hello 

1.42 2.55 B: hello 

2.88 3.76 B: hi 

3.70 4.75 A: hi 

5.03 6.92 A: this is brett chambers 

6.64 8.22 B: hi this is abby 

8.01 9.90 A: abby how are you abby 

9.32 10.68 B: good how are you 

10.51 12.34 A: good 

12.43 13.27 B: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

13.93 18.26 A: you wanna go ahead and start the question first 

18.03 21.34 B: um it was on the public school system correct 

21.30 28.12 A: yeah something about yeah what do you think about the public school system and how it what needs to be changed 

27.54 36.23 B: what needs to be changed um [lipsmack] sure i guess i can start um i think the public school system should be changed um 

37.67 40.76 B: (( i can't believe i'm doing this um [laughter] )) 

40.39 42.88 A: are you are you a teacher or or anything 

42.70 45.40 B: um no no actually i'm a student 

45.08 47.92 A: oh okay in the public school system 

46.03 46.89 B: yes 

47.59 50.44 B: (( in the public in the public school system um )) 

50.53 52.06 B: well i go to college now 

51.74 53.37 A: oh okay which one 

52.46 53.18 B: yeah 

53.32 55.07 B: uh daraclean university 

54.49 55.88 A: (( oh daraclean okay )) 

55.32 56.65 B: (( mm [lipsmack] )) 

56.35 62.23 A: i'm i'm outta school but i'm teaching now in a college 

62.16 63.33 B: which college 

63.39 66.05 A: central university in north carolina 

65.51 66.72 B: oh okay 

66.41 67.53 A: yeah 

67.48 73.38 B: um yeah i think the public school system needs to be changed um especially in the way of history 

73.59 74.15 A: (( [mn] )) 

73.60 80.60 B: um i think that they need to incorporate more world history i think that the students 

78.05 79.07 A: okay 

80.62 93.27 B: um in general don't have a a good basis for world history i know in a lot of high schools i've talked to a lot of students that they only had one year of world history and i think that's really hard to um 

93.52 98.07 B: make future decision based on history when you don't really know it 

98.14 99.19 B: um 

99.38 110.28 B: it's i think it's very important to understand history so you can understand what's gonna happen in the future and and americans they in general just seem not to have a very good basis on world history and 

110.36 111.74 B: and culture 

111.63 112.87 A: (( right mhm )) 

111.96 114.38 B: we seem to have this like isolated view 

114.68 116.75 B: where we just 

117.44 118.39 B: um 

118.45 126.18 B: where we sit in america and worry about americans and not w- worry about anyone else 'cause it doesn't really pertain to us in our small lives so 

126.11 128.65 A: (( do do you see as isolationists )) 

128.59 138.88 B: yeah as in like in isolation if you're even in the public schools um i recently went to germany for six months and i was just amazed at how the mass population seemed to have this 

139.14 153.55 B: grasp of history which actually relates further like as people mature it really seems the logic thinking and um [lipsmack] able to you can really pool the data banks up later and and look into it and make 

148.75 152.86 A: (( hm )) 

153.74 160.64 B: um clear and more concise decisions based on logic and not just i feel this way and and make 

161.26 162.03 B: you make 

162.12 162.97 A: (( [cough] )) 

162.31 164.84 B: more profound uh decisions i think 

165.04 166.31 A: so so you 

166.94 172.42 A: if i if i hear if i think hear what you're saying it allows for a certain amount of context [mn] 

169.63 170.54 B: mhm 

172.67 173.57 B: yes 

173.87 176.38 B: yeah it gives you a basis for um 

176.95 181.22 B: for making future decisions like over politics or um 

181.49 183.16 B: just how things work 

184.05 187.78 B: and um i think it also helps you understand culture more 

188.39 192.16 B: and why countries are making the decisions that they are 

192.19 194.35 B: if you understand more about their history 

194.17 195.76 A: right 

194.94 199.74 B: and so instead of just saying well like for instance germany didn't help us the war 

199.75 206.27 B: uh okay they're we don't like them anymore as friends then y- you can look at their history and say 

206.36 216.37 B: okay this is why they've had the history of war and and they don't want to put that on someone else and they want to try to work it through diplomatically and you can look back and 

215.14 219.65 A: [cough] mm there's some basis and some lo- like you i think you said logic 

219.44 221.15 B: yeah and logic thinking 

220.81 225.28 A: yeah because there's there's an established pattern and a causal effect 

224.63 226.31 B: right exactly 

226.42 227.49 B: mhm 

227.06 228.99 A: yeah okay okay 

228.89 229.81 B: and you 

229.38 235.60 A: yeah 'cause i [cough] i thought it was an interesting question because i have even uh the the irony is i teach 

236.13 240.73 A: a class in education one of my one of my classes i teach 

237.84 239.12 B: (( oh really mm )) 

240.80 243.72 A: and the other one is mass media in society 

243.17 244.45 B: right 

243.82 250.18 A: and in many ways because i teach mass media and i teach in the school education 

249.81 250.63 B: (( mm )) 

250.42 253.14 A: i don't see that there's a big difference between the two 

253.37 254.25 B: right 

253.90 255.07 A: although 

255.83 259.22 A: the people in education see there's a huge difference in 

259.42 273.41 A: teaching and education and mass media and the way i get them to kinda see the the link is i ask them where most kids or i ask most of them where most their kids learn their 

263.76 264.85 B: mhm 

273.41 274.87 A: their a. b. c.'s 

274.28 276.55 B: right exactly that's an issue 

275.33 277.77 A: invariably most people say sesame street 

277.24 278.69 B: mhm 

278.33 283.13 A: and i always point out is sesame street in a classroom [cough] or is it on television 

281.02 282.25 B: right 

283.47 286.84 B: yeah that's true we learn a lot from television 

286.33 293.41 A: yeah and most kids learn a lot either from the other the external media to the classroom 

292.83 294.34 B: mhm 

293.47 305.57 A: even more so than they do in the classroom and it should be no surprise i mean there's a big causal center points out that students spend more time with media than they do with the classroom [cough] 

296.01 297.40 B: right 

304.45 305.38 B: right 

305.42 310.91 A: and at because of the nature of the media it has a higher impact anyway 

310.52 311.78 B: mhm 

311.38 314.78 A: and when i was the other side i used to work in broadcasting 

314.34 315.49 B: mhm 

314.86 316.06 A: and so 

316.31 325.45 A: you know to me it's like your your your whole thing was world history mine is recognition of the the elements that actually program the students 

325.02 338.68 B: right right that's yeah that's another good point and i i agree the and kids are getting pumped full of uh propaganda and stuff from from the media i think that's also a very big problem but 

333.43 334.10 A: (( [noise] )) 

337.17 346.87 A: yeah it it is and when i you know the question that they ask you know what could be done to to redo the public schools [cough] basically 

346.89 348.34 A: in some ways 

349.59 354.51 A: education's the only industry that hasn't been re-engineered 

352.28 353.22 B: mhm 

354.47 355.78 B: mhm 

355.16 365.26 A: or one of the few that's left that has not been totally re-engineered the car industry had to go through a complete reengineering [cough] even the computer industry has gone through reengineering 

360.98 362.16 B: right 

364.70 365.60 B: right 

365.45 366.71 A: um 

367.76 371.64 A: you know you the st- i mean you can't pick uh 

371.67 378.31 A: a major industry that hasn't undergone major a major overhaul [cough] except education 

375.70 377.39 B: mhm 

377.83 378.80 B: right 

378.95 385.03 A: we're still basically tied to the agricultural schedule of september to may and june 

384.50 385.38 B: right 

385.28 389.96 A: um even though there are a lot of school systems switching to the year round schools 

390.02 392.74 A: um there's still um 

392.92 407.66 A: the teacher in front of the class even though there's a lot of there's there's a movement you know for people to do more interactive and what they call constructiveness learning and more student centered but it kinda makes it counter productive and or counter 

401.63 402.58 B: mhm 

408.96 410.94 A: (( what's the word i'm looking for )) 

411.05 412.21 B: (( mhm i'm not sure )) 

411.71 423.17 A: none of just the the self interest of the teachers' unions and the teachers is not served by [cough] by that from their perception you know if you 

416.21 417.47 B: right right 

421.87 422.69 B: mhm 

423.07 429.87 A: make it put it more in the students' hands then they're not as reliant on the teachers well actually they're more reliant on the teachers to have 

430.04 436.20 A: to become a guide as opposed to being the total expert because there's so much information out there now 

433.71 434.55 B: right 

435.78 442.47 B: yes there is and another thing i i think that happens is that teachers aren't paid that much in general 

442.03 443.15 A: oh right [cough] 

442.56 455.80 B: and so you're also getting students that you're not getting the best and brightest teaching your kids you're getting just kind of the leftovers that didn't go into um computer engineering or um 

455.92 458.32 B: you're not getting the really intelligent 

458.39 460.44 B: teachers so much in the high schools 

459.58 462.00 A: well i i used to think that way 

462.01 473.45 A: and i met some of the teachers and what we're getting to me what i think we get we get we get a bunch of we get some of those people that you're talking about in addition 

466.71 467.65 B: mhm 

471.27 472.32 B: right 

473.46 476.70 A: we get those people who are the warm and fuzzy folks 

476.35 477.46 B: mhm 

477.20 479.96 A: you now um you were saying how 

477.78 478.64 B: yeah 

479.99 488.05 A: uh other countries they they don't just base everything on how they feel and we get a a lot of these uh thinking feeling people and 

487.46 488.61 B: yeah 

489.23 495.52 A: who wind up basing a lot of what they do and what they teach on thinking feeling 

494.98 496.30 B: mhm 

495.71 498.73 A: and it's kind of like uh [cough] 

499.30 508.05 A: you know they they kinda teach the way they because they don't you know you've heard that saying a.'s teach b.'s work for c.'s 

507.65 508.67 B: mhm 

508.21 513.56 A: you've heard that saying before and it's kinda like that's kinda what it is is the a.'s teach 

509.66 510.55 B: yeah 

513.18 514.44 B: mhm 

513.81 515.77 A: um they have this 

516.23 519.85 A: they're almost like mostly the anal retentive types you know 

518.79 522.67 B: [laughter] yeah you see them all through high school don't you 

522.52 523.57 A: huh 

522.96 525.15 B: you see a lot of those through high school don't you 

524.94 528.61 A: oh yeah i see a lot of 'em in the school and education where i work 

525.26 526.48 B: [laughter] 

528.01 529.35 B: mhm 

528.72 536.26 A: you know because it's all a matter of how you did it not you know and and it's like did they feel good about the way you did it 

535.89 536.81 B: yeah 

536.46 538.08 A: you know so 

537.78 541.04 B: yeah and then a lot of times it comes it's so speculative it's 

541.10 542.22 B: (( you know um )) 

542.27 549.94 B: so relative because it comes down to whether the teacher likes you or not whether you get a good grade or whether they thought you did your best and it's not really based on 

545.28 546.25 A: yeah 

550.15 553.52 B: on how well the paper is and relative to the rest of the class 

553.13 560.11 A: yeah because how well the paper is based on how they felt and their perception and their context and their background 

556.91 557.76 B: right 

558.31 559.15 B: mhm 

559.55 560.48 B: right 

559.92 568.47 A: not be- [cough] whereas a really good paper for one professor especially content wise may not be that great a paper for another professor 

568.12 570.99 B: yeah exactly you always write for your professor 

570.61 571.80 A: right 

571.20 574.66 B: you have to learn what they want and then you end up writing for them 

574.25 577.53 A: (( right [cough] yeah and what year are you at daraclean )) 

575.05 577.08 B: and that's one thing i learned 

577.70 578.93 B: i'm a sophomore 

578.70 580.14 A: are you a teacher 

580.50 581.52 B: a teacher 

580.56 583.41 A: i mean educate- education major 

583.01 587.09 B: no no not at all i'm in international business and marketing 

586.66 592.85 A: oh i see and you're probably really bright so you're you're going off to do something else as opposed to going to the classroom 

587.70 588.61 B: mhm 

592.42 597.32 B: yes i was i was hoping to go to law school at the end of the month was what i was planning on doing 

596.98 599.89 A: yeah see that [cough] that on an edu-
