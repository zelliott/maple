0.40 4.06 A: yeah hi how's it going my name's octavia i'm from dallas texas 

4.08 9.04 B: hi this is dan mccarthy i'm uh fr- uh living in boston 

7.87 12.28 A: oh okay yeah as far as uh the topic i guess um 

12.39 19.51 A: one thing i would say just from personal experience i think uh the uh up until college as far as the public school system it's pretty uh 

19.54 24.19 A: pretty much easy [laughter] you really don't learn anything till you really get to college 

21.61 22.36 B: (( do )) 

24.47 26.12 B: (( uh that was your experience )) 

25.99 27.29 A: yeah 

27.03 29.12 B: (( uh where where did you go to school )) 

28.52 30.69 A: i went to texas a and m. university 

30.09 34.23 B: and where'd you go so uh whereabouts in texas did you go to high school 

33.40 35.61 A: oh dallas in dallas texas 

34.81 42.61 B: high school dallas all right been out there a bit myself um i think it depends on 

35.79 38.25 A: yeah yeah 

42.66 45.59 B: um maybe you're just a very smart guy 

45.08 55.43 A: mm [laughter] oh okay thanks for the compliment but uh i don't know it just seemed like um that's what my experience you know yeah i did fairly good at school and um 

46.55 47.65 B: [laughter] 

48.11 48.96 B: [laughter] 

55.61 60.70 A: but as far as you know it seems like they just baby you through the whole uh process because 

60.56 66.71 A: um you know it it's totally different in college for example because when we got something wrong you were just wrong 

66.21 67.21 B: mhm 

66.57 76.55 A: and uh whereas in the public you know through el- elementary to uh high school you know you were given a second chance oh okay if you can go and find the correct answers then i'll give you half the credit 

76.45 84.52 A: you know whereas in college you know if you got it wrong [laughter] you got it wrong there was no you know extra credit or try to make up you know 

78.94 79.50 B: (( [cough] )) 

79.86 81.02 B: right 

83.28 86.65 B: [mn] yeah i guess i have to agree with you the schools i went to um 

86.71 92.80 B: you could you could basically get bs and you know without having to do any work really 

90.14 91.11 A: yeah 

92.16 93.11 A: uh-huh 

93.03 94.61 B: or not much work 

94.30 95.99 A: yeah exactly 

94.95 97.92 B: you could sort of skate by um 

97.23 98.00 A: (( so )) 

98.09 104.70 B: with a gr- so so you your experience going through school the whole time you went to school was pretty much like that 

104.07 106.90 A: yeah yeah pretty much you know and uh 

107.45 117.07 A: so you know that's my only uh drawback and as far as you know um you know as far as my younger siblings and my cousins and just people who are going to 

117.23 129.32 A: uh high school i know you know they complain how hard it is and i'm like well what's so hard about it basically you know the you just [laughter] and i i do not ever recall bringing home uh homework from high school [laughter] no 

128.85 130.40 B: right now do you have kids 

130.60 133.02 A: no actually i don't i'm single [laughter] 

132.28 133.75 B: you don't you're single 

133.33 134.36 A: yeah 

133.80 141.11 B: um i've got a son who's fi- fourteen months so i haven't experienced it as a parent but um 

137.07 137.88 A: (( mm mm )) 

141.36 145.78 B: my parents were not terribly involved either with school and i wonder if 

145.82 150.80 B: if they had been uh it might of made a difference 'cause i certainly plan to be 

147.18 148.87 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

150.60 153.16 A: oh yeah definitely it's just uh 

153.03 167.33 A: and i i'll probably be the same way is that the only thing with me is like i can comprehend and it's real hard for me to teach somebody else to comprehend it that my only drawback [laughter] you know because i don't i don't understand why people don't un- don't get it when i get it you know what i mean 

162.22 163.02 B: mhm 

166.77 168.08 B: mhm 

167.35 178.39 A: but yo- you have people like that are really you know they're and i wherein people like that are real smart they know what's going on and when they but when they try to explain it to you you know you really don't get it so 

178.33 184.58 A: i'm probably like one of those people [laughter] you know that i pick it up but i can't really explain it to somebody else to pick it up 

180.32 182.22 B: so um uh 

184.28 186.89 B: what'd you study at texas a and m 

185.41 187.70 A: [laughter] oh some engineering 

188.34 189.94 B: mechanical or 

188.37 191.06 A: yeah uh mechanical yeah 

190.03 191.80 B: yeah that's what i am as well too 

191.40 193.62 A: oh really so um 

192.84 194.38 B: what what do you do now 

194.37 203.86 A: uh right now i'm actually looking for a job [laughter] but 'cause um i'm actually thought about going back to school and get an m._b._a. now 'cause i really don't like what i'm doing 

203.78 210.33 A: uh through uh the local the company here uh lucky mine in forth worth basically basically i had to travel 

208.17 208.98 B: mm 

210.21 219.19 A: was like a forty five minute uh drive to an hour but now they have like a rail system so i can go back and forth in about thirty minutes been just a hassle going back and forth 

213.28 214.58 B: mhm 

219.13 227.68 A: and i i really don't i got a the only reason i found to set up with them is 'cause i got uh you know be something like you know get money 

227.38 228.44 B: (( mhm no )) 

227.85 230.63 A: though um you know and honestly money's not 

230.70 236.34 A: you know money's good but it's not you know if i'm not happy in what i'm doing don't gonna be happy period so so 

234.96 240.39 B: it's not doing anything everything so do you own a house or a a condo or something 

239.83 244.37 A: yeah yeah i actually um yeah and my brother are paying for a house right now 

244.37 246.85 B: so um [mn] 

246.97 252.80 B: just you know one of the on- one of the issues with school is uh is taxes that you pay for 

251.79 257.06 A: oh yeah you know that's something that i hadn't thought about the taxes was outrageous 

256.91 259.96 B: really um i'm curious as to what your taxes are 

257.16 259.41 A: (( you know yeah )) 

259.80 264.46 A: uh you're probably looking at about i think it was a two thousand dollars of school tax 

264.60 267.00 B: the school tax or the total the total 

264.94 268.63 A: so yeah no no no i take that that was property tax 

268.56 277.78 A: think maybe close to uh either seven hundred or a thousand i don't know i i like 'cause i know i know there there's three on there's one property there's uh 

273.48 274.50 B: (( and what was the )) 

277.64 284.95 A: a city tax and then there's school tax where i well i don't know how wh- how it's done where you're at but that's the way we have it here 

281.58 283.07 B: mhm 

284.09 291.43 B: well we just pay one property tax so so the total property tax you pay would be what couple thousand 

290.33 292.61 A: yeah exact- easily 

292.20 294.02 B: yeah it's uh 

293.65 303.82 A: so and the thing is um our house here you know it went up like twenty five thousand uh because the every year they do an appraisal on it and so the more money it's worth 

294.12 294.86 B: so 

301.22 302.52 B: yeah of course they want 

304.05 310.30 A: the more i have to pay the taxes so that's not good [laughter] it's great if i'm about to sell it [laughter] 

309.42 313.11 B: yeah so uh how how big is the house you 

313.25 315.48 A: big is the house it's um 

316.17 318.95 A: you know i'm not go- as far as uh 

319.31 321.97 B: know some bedrooms or whatever square footage 

320.77 322.56 A: well it's got um 

323.05 331.43 A: it's got a living room dining room it's uh three bedroom two baths and the garage actually was converted into a living room 

330.96 332.56 B: oh so you have uh 

332.62 337.54 A: basically one two three four fi- about seven rooms i think 

337.43 343.93 B: yeah it's about that's the same kind of house that i have i have a colonial in in uh the boston area and close to town 

341.70 342.50 A: uh-huh 

343.73 345.87 A: oh you guys got basements right [laughter] 

345.19 348.50 B: we have a basement that is probably the difference you don't have a basement right 

347.82 350.56 A: no we don't have basements [laughter] they got [laughter] 

349.56 351.87 B: and you don't have a garage now it sounds like 

351.17 356.76 A: no no no no garage so it's like i said it was uh converted to a living room b- before we moved in here 

355.98 358.43 B: how big's the lot 

357.61 360.11 A: um it's a 

360.64 364.09 B: quarter acre at at is it like a 

362.30 368.30 A: i'm sorry um about a quarter an acre 'cause we got a nice little uh front and back yard so 

367.59 377.53 B: that's about it's it's a little bigger lot than ours but but i'm just thinking i'm just wanting to compare with you on that because the taxes here for the price the price that i have it's probably very similar to what you have 

377.29 378.45 A: yeah 

377.79 383.16 B: in terms of property and everything the taxes i pay are like sixty six hundred dollars 

382.85 383.93 A: oh okay 

384.45 388.47 B: so you your i would like your tax bill [laughter] 

386.68 397.30 A: oh really i say it it might be more it's just like you said um it we i don't keep track of all them really 'cause you know there's not mu- there's little you can do about them you know you have to pay them period 

396.51 399.93 B: well you can you can dede- deduct it of course from your taxes right 

399.24 406.99 A: yeah that's the only good thing in as far as uh you know that uh use that as a deduction so that helps out a lot [laughter] 

406.35 416.46 B: um [mn] yeah it does help so i i'm just wondering too because i think the school the the school in the town that we're in has a has a good reputation 

414.50 415.37 A: (( mhm )) 

416.39 417.44 A: oh yeah 

416.86 418.26 B: and um 

418.14 419.29 A: yeah 

418.62 420.79 B: i'm wondering how much of a factor 

420.81 422.74 B: it is that 

421.89 424.09 A: well i always went to um 

424.34 433.61 A: well like here in dallas i went to like a suburb called richardson and richardson's always been held as a you know high esteem you know school as far as academic wise 

433.02 433.87 B: (( mm )) 

433.88 437.64 A: so um maybe i just had um good teachers i guess [laughter] 

437.82 442.82 A: and um but i guess and i think our pride another draw would probably be 

442.86 445.01 A: um i guess um 

445.35 454.68 A: not anybody really i uh i graduated from a high school about uh was it eight hundred people so you know i really yeah 

450.89 452.13 B: mhm 

452.24 453.69 B: (( the whole school )) 

454.66 456.55 B: that's a pretty small school actually 

455.94 461.13 A: oh actually no no my sorry i'm thinking about my class that was my senior class 

457.76 459.04 B: that was your class 

459.36 462.30 B: yeah mine was five that's a big that's a very big school 

461.71 472.32 A: yeah it was yeah that was my senior class i'm going back um you know and i actually just made a couple of because i'll be going back to my ten year high school reunion in about yeah so um 

464.51 465.13 B: (( mm )) 

469.65 471.80 B: (( oh you will [laughter] )) 

472.24 486.45 A: you know i've ran into some guys i had never met before had a ball you know we're just talking and you know like where you from i'm here from richardson you know which high school you go to same high school when did you graduate ninety three like i never met those guys before you know people 

485.02 486.42 B: that's funny yeah that's 

486.52 487.66 A: (( so uh )) 

487.36 488.86 B: a big school now 

488.28 490.07 A: yeah exactly 

489.60 493.40 B: um so you graduated in uh nineteen ninety three 

492.81 494.85 A: yeah ninety three exactly 

494.02 497.18 B: i i graduated in nineteen eighty 

497.01 498.06 A: oh really 

498.30 500.51 A: oh [laughter] as far as that 

499.97 501.48 B: little little older 

501.67 503.23 B: [laughter] 

502.21 505.10 A: yeah that's a little bigger difference there but uh 

505.08 513.56 A: um i don't know it's just kinda hard as far as uh if you as far as our property's concerned as far as you haven't really input because if you're not really in 

513.48 523.19 A: that position or don't have anybody in there like children you really you just have to go on past experience and that's my only past experience that i that i can think of at this point oh okay uh-huh 

522.41 526.22 B: yeah i've actually went i actually went to uh two different high schools 

525.28 526.84 A: (( um in long beach california and )) 

526.25 537.76 B: (( one in southern california it was and yeah )) 

528.81 530.18 A: (( it was the best school in in the )) 

535.14 540.15 A: town in in in long beach oh really yeah mm as far as what as far as academic or sports or 

539.68 543.37 B: bo- both but it really it had a good reputation for for academic 

543.11 543.92 A: (( uh )) 

543.52 551.16 B: and um it had excellent programs it was sorta like you know and the campus that it had sort of like a little college campus it was real nice 

548.15 548.91 A: (( mm )) 

550.87 552.02 A: oh okay 

551.95 558.13 B: but the school i went to in michigan and and i got a lot out of that program but the school i went to in michigan was 

558.17 566.40 B: um completely different um it really you really could you know i you didn't 

559.50 560.20 A: (( mm )) 

561.55 562.70 A: yeah 

566.55 568.83 B: most people didn't get a lot out of it 

568.24 569.64 A: oh yeah 

569.16 575.86 B: um you could you know work hard and do your own thing and and and but i actually wound up 

573.96 575.27 A: yeah 

575.87 579.76 B: as a senior in high school i was taking classes at the local university 

579.20 580.17 A: (( oh okay )) 

580.06 582.75 B: because i wasn't getting enough out of out of high school 

582.38 595.90 A: oh yeah okay i see what you mean yeah see that's another another just tip on that point i would say uh it's virtually in the high 'cause i don't think they prepare you enough for college uh because that you know i i didn't know how to study going up to college 

591.15 592.33 B: mhm 

595.57 596.80 B: mhm 

596.18 598.61 A: you know i was you know i you know 

597.25 598.79 B: i have to agree with that 

598.75 599.89 A: uh just uh
