1.11 2.94 B: hi this is jeff parsons 

2.50 5.12 A: hi i'm delores underwood 

4.76 6.03 B: hi nice to meet you 

6.08 7.35 A: same here 

9.45 12.63 B: so let's see public schools um 

12.77 19.18 B: i'm actually an education major in college so i guess this is right up my alley [laughter] 

17.52 18.50 A: uh-huh 

19.57 21.70 A: yeah well um 

22.26 24.57 A: all my children are out of school now 

24.73 25.88 A: they're all 

28.15 29.21 A: older 

29.70 30.75 B: (( oh okay )) 

30.08 31.49 A: and um 

32.11 35.18 A: my grandkids are too little 

35.95 37.75 A: they're not in school yet 

38.30 40.13 B: right 

39.08 43.85 A: but i never had any problem with the public school system 

44.38 45.63 B: right 

45.82 49.22 B: the only problem um that i've seen like 

49.54 52.83 B: seems like around the country right now is just the financial 

53.09 55.55 B: situation that they're all in um 

55.64 60.97 B: you know we've i know here in the south we've had a lot of teacher layoffs 

61.09 64.40 B: because of cut backs in the budget and that kind of thing 

64.05 65.42 A: yes 

64.76 74.04 B: so it makes it kind of kind of risky going into that field um you know not knowing if you're gonna be able to find a job once you're actually graduated or not that 

69.00 70.40 A: right 

74.43 78.33 B: to me i think that's the biggest problem um 

78.43 79.88 B: as far as like 

80.66 82.46 B: i mean i don't i don't really know 

83.21 87.51 B: i guess there's probably i i went to a private school when i was in high school and 

86.41 87.06 A: (( mm )) 

87.63 90.54 B: um people say that private schools are 

90.94 99.39 B: better than than public schools and i guess in a way it was i mean we didn't have as much violence and that kind of thing but um 

97.56 98.99 A: right 

99.91 101.46 B: different things like 

102.30 107.06 B: like drugs and that kind of thing i mean it was around in the private school too so 

107.43 111.41 B: it it's it's i think pretty much the same in in both 

111.71 113.77 A: yeah i agree 

117.40 118.25 B: (( um let's )) 

122.23 122.86 B: (( see )) 

126.10 127.16 A: (( yeah um )) 

126.30 127.47 B: (( and i know )) 

127.59 135.56 B: here in the well this is i guess nationwide the they've got a new act that they've come out with the no child left behind act um 

135.81 137.11 B: it says that 

137.29 138.91 B: teachers have to be 

139.90 141.06 B: have to be 

141.57 149.34 B: qualified to teach so they have to go through um they there are going to be probably a lot of lay offs in the next few years or so because of that but 

149.40 150.26 B: um 

151.05 153.82 B: like i know for for us with 

153.99 157.64 B: while we're still going through the college they told us that we'd have to 

157.66 170.02 B: we can't graduate with a degree in just education we have to have another degree to go along with it so we're gonna like since i'm maybe like an english teacher i have to have a an education degree and an english degree 

169.84 170.84 A: mm 

170.05 174.44 B: which which means that i'm gonna be in in school a lot longer than i expected but 

173.89 174.78 A: (( uh-huh )) 

175.27 176.31 B: (( but um )) 

178.80 187.19 A: no well we're live we live down south now we've just lived here three years i'm originally from michigan 

188.38 189.73 A: and um 

192.55 194.45 A: we lived in uh 

197.24 199.59 A: well middle class i guess 

200.64 202.00 A: suburb and 

202.34 208.41 A: i our school district was was one of the best in the area 

208.80 210.59 A: (( with you know more a )) 

210.71 214.05 A: little more money than some not as much as others 

214.79 216.49 A: so they they had um 

218.03 220.45 A: you know it was pretty good 

222.48 224.75 A: my son graduated 

226.02 228.06 A: with a three point eight 

228.48 231.73 A: grade point average and he you know he did real well 

231.41 233.24 B: right 

232.46 234.28 A: teachers were 

236.80 238.88 A: good you know they were 

239.78 243.48 A: caring helpful and everything 

242.47 244.30 B: right 

243.66 248.55 A: and like i don't know too much around here because like i said i don't have any kids in school 

248.81 249.77 B: right 

249.17 252.61 A: but i remember also when he was in school 

252.82 254.96 A: and my 

255.05 258.01 A: my husband's nieces and nephews were in school here 

258.02 263.27 A: he was way ahead of them they were higher like 

260.19 262.01 B: mhm 

263.36 265.36 A: a couple years older than him 

266.28 269.82 A: and what they were doing in school here he'd he'd already done 

270.50 271.53 B: right 

271.33 272.44 A: you know 

273.12 279.05 B: yeah it's that's that i think that's uh one of the problems too in in public schools um 

279.12 290.51 B: here i know like when i was in like elementary and middle school like i was in the the gifted program you know that was trying to or the enrichment program i guess is what they call it where you know they give you work that's 

285.44 286.35 A: (( mhm )) 

290.51 296.11 B: ahead of everybody else 'cause you get bored and that kind of thing which sounds kinda like what you're talking about with you know and him being 

291.28 292.83 A: (( right mm )) 

296.15 307.43 B: um more advanced than the other kids and once like i got out of middle school it's like that stopped they don't have it in like high school and um or at least down here they don't in in high school 

303.81 304.79 A: mm 

307.59 310.61 B: and they've even cut it out of some middle schools so 

311.51 314.74 B: i think it's it's a really important thing to have um 

315.10 325.05 B: something so you don't get bored and you know you're sitting in class doing this busy work all the time um because you're not really learning anything like like doing that kind of stuff 

317.19 318.23 A: right 

324.69 326.71 A: right 

329.33 330.33 B: (( um )) 

336.64 347.19 A: [mn] well i i just remember he used to he used to help them with homework you know [laughter] and he they were older than him so it was all you know 

341.33 342.63 B: oh really 

342.64 343.45 B: (( [laughter] )) 

348.12 351.05 A: from the higher grades and that he'd already done 

350.86 364.65 B: right right so do you think that was um do you think that wo- had a lot to do with like the school system he was in like the teachers and and that kind of thing um or or was it you think more like his personal um 

364.91 371.80 A: i i think it was more with the teachers and the curriculum that you know um 

364.98 366.22 B: like intelligence 

376.49 379.00 A: they what they were teaching 

380.07 386.31 A: you know what they were teaching in the lower grades there they weren't getting to that here 

385.31 392.63 B: [mn] right right yeah i think that's an important important thing is to have good teachers in like the um 

392.68 399.06 B: the critical years like you know around elementary and middle school because once you get to high school it's pretty much you know you if 

399.11 407.39 B: if you haven't learned you know how to study and you haven't learned you know to care about your work you're not gonna start doing that once you get to high school 

403.26 404.48 A: right 

406.75 408.54 A: that's right yeah 

407.82 414.11 B: so i yeah i think it's real important to have have good teachers in the lower grades and in the middle schools and um 

409.43 410.17 A: (( [cough] )) 

414.29 416.06 B: to help motivate and 

416.29 417.61 B: all that good stuff 

443.12 444.26 B: but um 

445.17 446.04 A: (( my )) 

446.13 450.11 A: youngest daughter went to special ed 

450.42 451.28 B: uh-huh 

451.03 454.77 A: and she's um she's got cerebral palsy 

455.04 455.93 B: okay 

455.54 459.10 A: so she and now you know in michigan 

459.98 463.28 A: you're entitled to an education from birth to twenty five 

463.05 464.03 B: right 

464.39 465.85 A: and 

466.91 473.16 A: she's twenty three now but had i stayed in michigan she would of still been going to 

473.47 475.24 A: the public school system 

475.36 476.74 B: right 

476.36 477.61 A: and um 

478.15 480.71 A: they also had a very good program 

480.74 488.36 A: whereas now here she she's an adult they once they turn i think it's nineteen 

488.81 491.43 A: they're they're out of the public school system

503.28 506.21 A: well i don't have to pay for it it's paid for through 

506.47 508.46 A: medicare and medicaid 

508.39 509.56 B: right 

508.91 510.25 A: but um 

510.53 512.75 A: and it's it's not bad 

514.99 517.33 B: yeah i think here the um 

515.49 516.22 A: (( but )) 

517.70 529.67 B: the the law is i think it's twenty one and then at twenty one they're um not not in public school any more if you if you're in special education uh programs 

525.58 526.50 A: mm 

529.76 531.78 B: um but i know even 

532.98 534.39 B: i think 

534.55 542.12 B: when i was in middle school we had um a couple of of kids that were i think seventeen or eighteen 

541.84 542.79 A: mm 

542.24 547.49 B: that were in the um the special education classes there so um 

548.32 552.56 B: i don't know if they if they finished out of the middle school or if they went on to the high school 

553.57 559.05 B: 'cause i don't know i'm i'm not even sure if in that school district when i went there that's that's when i was in public school the middle school 

558.04 558.90 A: mm 

559.08 563.95 B: and i only i don't know you know after i got out of middle school i transferred to private school so 

564.48 566.55 B: i'm not sure how that worked 

565.94 575.77 A: yeah i'm not sure i'm really not sure how it works here either because by like i said by the time we moved here she was already too old for the public school here 

575.82 576.80 B: right 

576.00 577.29 A: and um 

578.62 581.21 A: but they did they had a real good program 

582.20 583.98 A: you know in michigan where i 

586.10 595.78 A: where i lived and where they integrated them with in with the regular regular education and um
