14.46 15.58 B: (( yes )) 

15.70 16.44 A: (( ah )) 

15.77 18.16 B: well to ah to business 

17.85 19.68 A: yeah 

18.58 21.54 B: (( i don't know ah )) 

22.82 28.63 A: well we all we all know the value of a million bucks but we don't know the value of our friends [laughter] 

22.93 23.79 B: that's a 

28.38 41.41 B: well that's true that's true but then again i i guess we the it could we would could they consider ah writing a letter to explain why we're not speaking to them ah talking to them again 

42.01 42.99 A: (( um )) 

43.00 44.15 A: i don't know 

44.32 50.84 A: i think i i would for the purpose of our conversation we could just say that it means no further communications 

50.85 51.81 B: (( [mn] )) 

51.22 60.41 A: and you could you know would that mean you could have a friend tell a friend yeah i suppose you could or write a letter i i don't know but um [mn] i just uh 

60.87 62.41 B: (( oh )) 

61.18 63.73 A: for a million bucks [noise] [lipsmack] 

63.82 66.13 A: i think i'd probably do it 

66.54 70.83 B: [cough] yeah well you know you'd you'd probably have ah 

71.04 74.26 B: find a lot of other friends [laughter] 

72.97 78.67 A: yeah well you but a you know a lot of people would say like you know my my wife is my best friend 

79.02 80.36 A: (( and um )) 

81.19 83.56 A: i don't think i'd be willing to write her off 

85.30 87.25 B: (( i don't know that's a thought )) 

87.46 88.52 A: yeah 

88.68 97.49 B: i don't know i don't know but you know i mean i guess i g- no no i'm uh divorced ah thirty one years 

91.13 92.49 A: are you married nate 

97.08 99.73 A: thirty one years since you've been married 

99.07 100.10 B: yes 

99.95 101.78 A: wow quite a while 

101.30 103.68 B: yeah yeah 

102.65 104.82 A: uh how long were you married 

104.65 105.70 B: five 

106.23 108.72 A: so it left a pretty bad taste in your mouth 

108.95 112.66 B: well no yeah yeah yeah but ah 

114.09 116.93 B: well i guess if the right person came along i would ah 

117.24 125.15 B: reconsider but i haven't been obviously over that period of time i haven't been actively pursuing that uh kind of an endeavor 

125.55 129.52 A: yeah i suspect that between the two of us uh i would 

129.64 143.60 A: you know if i regard my wife as my best friend it's probably a deeper friend in many ways a much deeper friendship than what you would have in your life if we didn't regard her as my best friend i would suspect that because you're not married you'd probably have a couple of friendships that are 

143.66 145.44 A: pretty darn important to you 

146.68 157.34 B: yeah that's true that's true and and you know the ah the sharing of ah of your deeper your deeper feelings with someone who 

157.64 169.75 B: you know understands what you're talking about is isn't really something that uh money could buy i mean there's a lot of things that i could imagine doing with a million dollars that 

169.69 170.63 A: uh-huh 

169.83 179.78 B: that ah you know would not would not require the sharing with another person but you know on an emotional level ah 

179.95 183.17 B: i don't know you know i mean i i i can't 

184.44 198.24 B: i can't i can't that that that's a real hard one to answer i would really have to either have the money in front of me and the uh offer right there on the table or else i i would think that anything i would say would be just rhetoric in a conversation 

197.74 206.21 A: yeah the hypothetical is the difficult part because you can't you can't know how you'd really believe in what seems to be an impossible situation 

206.51 209.22 B: [mn] because you know like you you always hear uh 

209.14 221.70 B: uh somebody you know you're you're walking down the street and say somebody uh was walking in front of you and they drop what looks to be a uh a wad of money you know three inches thick and there's hundreds on both sides 

221.54 232.46 B: are you going to say hey you dropped this or and be the honest person or are you just going to uh [mn] look around and notice nobody's looking at you and just put it in your pocket and keep going 

232.50 236.99 A: well i know my answer to that without any doubt at all do you know yours mhm 

237.80 239.67 B: in that kind of situation 

240.37 251.22 B: uh probably but once again uh uh i like to think of myself as as honest uh and and um caring of uh the next person 

249.70 250.87 A: yeah 

251.21 254.49 A: i would definitely give it b- i'd say hey you dropped this 

254.56 255.63 A: (( i wouldn't )) 

255.72 259.52 A: i i would not even consider not doing that 

261.20 268.12 B: well that it's it's then it's it's it's that they didn't give that as the hypothetical because you could be concrete with that one 

261.24 262.10 A: it's a 

267.69 273.81 A: yeah [laughter] i've i'm pretty concrete with the other one too [laughter] 

272.88 285.44 B: [laughter] yeah no no no i i heard i heard when you said that and uh you know i'm i'm in a sense i guess i'm i'm envious of uh that that closeness that you have that you could immediately say that i 

285.39 289.69 B: i know i do ha- i do have friends but i would always have uh 

289.95 300.21 B: like i said they they the i would have to either [mn] the money would have to be in front of me and say okay make your decision 'cause hypothetically speaking is always 

295.60 296.87 A: yeah 

297.50 298.42 A: right 

300.02 309.25 B: you know you can you can take the high road and and just say it and uh i'm being honest you know i i there are friends that i value but uh 

309.44 315.24 B: and and the like i mentioned earlier the having somebody to uh to share your 

315.28 323.07 B: deepest feelings and know that they understand and that they don't care that you may not have any money or whatever 

322.92 335.40 B: but on the other hand uh you know having a lot of money but and then knowing that people are going to listen to whatever you say just to uh have you around because you're you're a little bit better off than they are [sigh] 

331.72 332.67 A: sure 

336.00 337.52 B: yeah 

336.84 349.95 A: yeah i think it i- i i suppose ultimately it all comes down to what one's values are and and i and i um as i said i i w- i certainly wouldn't if my wife is my best friend would not say 

350.10 355.98 A: i would accept the money i- for i can't think of another individual in the world though that i would feel that close to my 

355.24 356.33 B: [laughter] 

356.24 367.37 A: [laughter] my parents are dead my brother's dead and and so i'm kind of without family um i wouldn't i wouldn't accept the offer for i- uh if it were made with any of my children 

361.25 362.21 B: mhm 

367.71 369.50 A: you know i just uh 

369.63 374.15 A: uh but i'm but i [sigh] like i said i could just uh 

374.41 382.19 A: or i wouldn't do it if i had to give up all of my friends but one yeah [laughter] but yeah [laughter] 

377.90 383.58 B: [laughter] but not your but not your best friend 

383.99 388.87 A: well if my best friend's my wife the answer is no but i don't have anybody else that's even close 

386.41 388.12 B: right right 

388.62 389.57 B: uh-huh 

389.42 392.04 A: [lipsmack] did you see that movie with um 

392.36 395.87 A: uh demi moore and uh 

395.11 396.84 B: oh woody harrelson 

396.68 398.55 A: yeah yeah and 

397.57 402.26 B: yeah the uh about the uh what was that they were in in vegas and uh a 

402.27 405.50 B: guy gave him a million dollars for a weekend with his wife was that it 

404.77 407.15 A: yeah that was it 

407.01 409.50 B: yeah well you know it 

408.38 412.17 A: now there's a hypothetical situation that's hard to accept also [sigh] 

412.61 414.05 B: yeah that's true 

413.58 415.94 A: can you hold on [noise] just one second i'll be right with you 

415.66 417.47 B: yeah 

433.88 438.36 A: sorry i know that's not what we're getting paid to do i was [laughter] 

434.72 435.85 B: that's okay 

436.42 443.21 B: [laughter] [laughter] yeah i was i was just happy that the that the uh computer didn't cut in and say time's up 

442.65 452.14 A: [laughter] um yeah well it was uh and who was the guy that uh the i can't think of the guy with the money 

452.32 459.24 A: good looking guy that w- that and i just you know there's another one it's like well how do you make that kind of a decision 

459.37 460.90 A: you could say oh well i 

460.95 465.02 A: it's only it's not going to be personal and all that but it is 

465.45 466.77 A: (( you know and so )) 

466.90 468.40 A: there's a hard one 

468.35 472.64 B: yeah yeah well you know it it's i guess they they 

472.65 477.09 B: obviously they they think of these questions to ah try and um 

477.18 482.35 B: at least get us something that that we can talk about [laughter] pretty straight straight through for ten minutes 

482.00 488.09 A: uh-huh what's the purpose of this fisher institute what do they do with this information and these conversations 

488.27 500.79 B: i'm uh i'm not really certain i i think it has something to do with uh uh analyzing uh uh a a form of voice transcription software similar to uh 

500.89 507.83 B: what is it called you know the one you can talk into the uh computer and it will uh type words out 

506.87 511.49 A: oh i you know what i have voice recognition software on a phone system that i sell 

511.78 514.45 A: it's incredible absolutely incredible 

514.35 515.43 B: uh-huh 

515.49 516.65 A: it's um 

517.42 522.70 A: it's ama- it's abso- it's just fantastic i don't ever dial my phone i just pick it up and say 

522.74 525.39 A: you know call nate in philadelphia 

524.53 538.38 B: oh yeah yeah yeah yeah okay well no this this would be um uh well that's voice recognition i think this is this is transcription similar to uh you know computer software that uh i think i._b._m. uh 

530.39 531.36 A: yeah 

538.32 540.37 A: takes words and puts it in 

538.46 539.77 B: with the 

540.27 546.42 B: yeah yeah yeah you know you you you talk into the computer you say uh dear uh dear charles uh 

540.63 541.47 A: text 

546.51 551.11 B: uh semi colon uh paragraph uh uh how are you doing 

548.00 548.83 A: uh-huh 

549.72 553.50 A: so they don't really care what we talk about as long as we keep talking 

552.78 562.69 B: well yeah well i i i think that there are maybe they are looking for certain words that we may use uh different dialect not dialects uh different accents 

561.06 562.29 A: but dialogues 

562.72 563.79 B: um 

563.95 568.88 B: but i don't know but you know given uh that this this is my second call 

568.08 572.22 A: yeah mine too [noise] and you and you only get three right hm 

569.77 570.79 B: so 

572.16 573.21 B: yes 

573.71 586.34 B: i i thought i heard a voice there but then i i don't know 'cause when i when i spoke to the uh the interviewer initially he said that they had started out uh they were doing like between fifteen and twenty five calls 

586.49 593.22 B: you know per person and then they just yeah so maybe they were looking for more diversity 

588.01 589.53 A: oh really 

592.96 594.33 A: i suspect 

593.76 599.11 B: but uh but as i say the they they are unique unique subjects 

599.14 599.89 B: and uh
