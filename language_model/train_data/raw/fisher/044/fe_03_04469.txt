178.20 178.97 A: (( yes )) 

178.68 183.06 B: and i guess it's more of peer pressure than anything else

186.83 192.20 A: [cough] new city bus operator and i i travel you know on the buses and uh

204.87 206.08 A: and uh 

206.57 210.76 A: i'll be honest with you i i get uh i get along with the with the uh 

207.92 213.66 B: (( mhm )) 

210.89 213.30 A: kids no matter you know what age they are 

213.42 221.64 A: you know the younger ones of course i uh since i have two young children i can i can relate to them and then i 

221.72 223.88 A: you know throughout my lifetime of you know 

223.68 232.96 B: well i was just reading in today's daily news this morning that a sixteen year old got stabbed at one of the public schools so 

223.97 224.78 A: but 

231.44 232.43 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

233.08 238.65 B: i mean if he can sneak a a weapon into the school and they have metal detectors 

238.51 246.69 B: what they're trying to say is that the kid snuck the metal uh knife into um the metal part of a 

246.67 254.15 B: a um book pack or something like that that that's how the metal detectors didn't um detect it so 

248.74 250.10 A: oh right yes 

252.64 258.39 A: right well if they ever did detect it he would of just said oh that's just part of the school bag or something 

256.89 263.11 B: mhm so it's pretty bad that when you go to school and they need metal detectors 

258.53 259.61 A: mm that's 

262.99 271.93 B: i mean when i was in high school all they needed was security guards now they need metal detectors because they're scared that the students are coming to school with 

271.86 280.64 B: weapons and if you're coming to school with weapons something's not right 

277.11 278.17 A: (( yeah yes it's )) 

279.50 288.17 A: yes yeah and uh i don't know how i don't know how you feel about it do you feel that uh possibly it's uh the breakdown in the family or just uh 

288.25 297.07 A: the children or yeah people say that oh the breakdown of family well i mean today the breakdown of the family is uh one out of two 

288.25 291.24 B: um not necessarily because when i 

295.87 298.35 B: mhm 

297.57 299.46 A: and then i was reading uh 

300.37 305.66 A: just the other day or i heard it on the radio no i think i was reading it and they said that uh 

301.42 308.90 B: (( mhm )) 

305.82 307.13 A: the um 

307.51 310.25 A: (( the rate of divorce amongst )) 

310.61 315.94 A: uh parents that have been previously divorced in other words their second marriages 

315.93 326.41 A: their second marriages have a greater uh divorce rate uh sixty two percent of marriages that uh okay rebound marriages 

326.52 328.98 A: second marriages end in divorce 

329.59 339.15 A: and uh i i can i can see how this affects the children people have you know i don't actually teach the children i have taught sunday school you know 

339.10 353.15 A: and uh you know being in a church does not exempt you does not exempt you from uh having broken families because in my church i would say at least half of the people like like the national statistics 

353.24 355.29 A: at least half of the people that are there 

355.51 363.98 A: uh are either divorced they've remarried or still divorced or you know in that state and the children that are there 

363.99 373.52 A: are products of broken homes now they're they're in a church environment which is a little better but you know the uh the effects are still out there 

373.29 375.10 B: well in my case 

373.63 374.54 A: and 

375.11 376.07 B: i um 

376.07 390.59 B: i came from um you know a separated mother and father my father and mother broke up when i was younger but it really didn't affect me it's because i was the type of person where i wasn't influenced by what other people did 

379.63 380.73 A: (( yeah no )) 

389.85 391.76 A: (( that's exactly the same way yeah )) 

390.55 404.34 B: there's some kids out there you know they looking for friends and the peer pressure make them do those things my cousin she went to private school and she was like a straight a student 

404.88 406.38 B: and um 

406.52 410.80 B: she was one of the ones that took the the road of um 

410.97 417.77 B: peer pressure and she end up going down and she didn't even go to public school that's one of the reasons why her mother 

417.63 427.11 B: sent her to private school because she feared that she was going to get influenced by the wrong people and she ended up getting influenced by the by the wrong people so 

426.90 434.02 B: i don't think it's um a matter of whether the school is public or private because if a uh a a kid's going to get 

434.07 442.14 B: influenced it's gonna be no matter what school you go to private or public because when you break it down 

442.56 453.30 B: peer pressure is peer pressure no matter what there's so many kids out there they just looking for um other people to accept them that they're willing to try 

453.88 464.06 B: to do whatever their other friends are doing to be accepted so i don't i'm not i don't think it's just the public schools i think it's just you know 

464.41 467.64 A: yeah i i guess you can yes i i see that 

464.56 466.12 B: schools in general 

467.76 471.34 B: (( mhm )) 

467.91 468.71 A: (( yes )) 

469.06 475.10 A: uh in my particular school you know the uh the tuition is is so so high 

475.58 481.02 A: that the parents if the parents are going to send the children there they going to make sure that they uh 

479.60 483.11 B: (( mhm )) 

481.77 482.57 A: (( you )) 

482.64 483.48 A: (( know )) 

483.84 489.70 A: and sometimes of course they send the children to private school expecting them to be the uh 

490.29 492.84 A: the entire influence on the children 

492.89 495.23 A: (( you know the teaching and like your yeah yeah right )) 

493.13 498.73 B: yeah well i have a friend who um his um nephew 

498.75 510.07 B: is being raised by him and his uh mother and his uh sister the father of that child's not there and the child goes to um 

510.42 514.97 B: catholic school so you know and he's so 

515.80 517.88 B: far he's going down you know 

518.02 527.73 B: great path only for the influence of you know my friend but his father's not there so whatever goes on in school 

521.71 522.40 A: (( yeah )) 

527.89 534.20 B: is basically what's gonna take him down the road he's gonna go because no matter what there's always gonna be 

534.42 538.56 B: you know like they said when one bad apple spoils the whole bunch 

538.60 541.72 B: but you know there's always a a rotten apple somewhere 

542.50 544.45 B: i seen it growing up 

544.53 557.11 B: i mean i'm sure everyone's seen it growing up there's always one kid in school that no matter what he's always you know he don't want to accept the rules he wants to go and do what he wants to do 

555.70 556.44 A: yeah 

557.00 564.00 B: (( mhm )) 

557.40 560.87 A: yes that's even in uh in the sunday school 

560.91 565.47 A: uh environment that i that i that i teach children in 

565.61 574.29 A: when i'm at you know at church i see there's always you know one and and they have to be they have to be the center of attention and they have to always make comments 

572.14 573.95 B: yeah 

574.34 577.13 B: the class clown yeah 

574.41 575.61 A: funny comments 

575.95 580.98 A: class clown yeah i mean in in my lifetime i i was always a 

581.06 584.40 B: (( mhm )) 

581.35 583.45 A: (( like an a student ))
