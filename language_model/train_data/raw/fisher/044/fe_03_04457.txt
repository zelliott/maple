25.23 33.82 A: oh really oh it's kinda fun i mean you just kinda start talking on the topic and then before you know it the ten minutes is up and they interrupt you and tell you you're done

36.01 41.65 B: well excellent that's that's great and they said that the uh the topic today was the school public system 

41.04 43.81 A: yeah the the problems with the public schools 

43.72 45.48 B: i see i see 

44.95 46.89 A: do you have kids in public school 

46.58 48.62 B: i don't i 

47.73 52.74 A: i don't either [laughter] well i have kid but he's not old enough 

48.87 50.38 B: you don't have any either 

52.53 54.22 B: how how old is your kid 

53.66 55.22 A: he's only four 

54.69 56.05 B: he's only four 

55.68 58.63 A: but you know i'm not gonna send him to public school i mean 

59.18 68.25 A: there's so you know what i think i i think they're just too disorganized and their standards aren't high enough and they try to teach a bunch of crap that they really don't need 

64.79 65.88 B: mhm 

68.39 73.83 B: right right i um now now did you go to a private school when you grew when you were growing up 

73.25 74.80 A: oh no i went to public 

74.66 76.05 B: oh you went to a public 

75.01 87.62 A: i went to public yes [laughter] and you know you know it doesn't bother you when you're going there but now that you're when you're a parent you're like okay do i really want my kid going to school and then they show movies and stuff you know or they take 'em bowling or 

80.62 81.56 B: mhm 

85.35 86.40 B: yeah 

87.78 90.91 A: you know why do they do that kinda stuff it's like a waste of time 

90.59 93.11 B: yeah yeah well there's um 

93.27 106.46 B: there's i i went to a to a public school also and most of all my family uh i have two older brothers that both have kids and they're they're both in public schools and they they talk highly about it so i 

106.66 112.78 B: i i don't know i mean i the way that i look at the system is is you know i think it needs to be 

106.76 107.36 A: (( [laughter] )) 

113.15 117.73 B: maybe brought up from within that the reason that the the public schools are 

117.72 127.69 B: uh looked down upon is that maybe the teachers aren't getting paid enough and there's not enough money getting funneled through the public system to where you kind of up it a little bit 

124.99 126.01 A: right 

127.59 135.35 B: and uh be able to get some teachers in there that really care and and really just get the the feelings and the energy up a little bit higher 

130.87 132.32 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

135.19 145.52 A: yeah i think a a big problem is that the teachers are so busy trying to be parents as well because a lot of these kids you know they're they're not well fed at home they're not well clothed 

145.66 155.28 A: you know a lot are neglected or you know they're just kinda sent to school because um you know they're kinda sent and they're not really provided for at home 

148.10 149.03 B: right 

154.97 156.12 B: absolutely 

155.53 164.52 A: and then you end up um like one of my friends is a teacher and she said she has to look at the kids for lice and you know she has to send the kids lice 

162.62 163.80 B: for lice 

164.30 165.35 B: oh 

164.87 176.47 A: yeah [laughter] and that she'll send a kid home you know for being sick or for having like a lice infestation and the parents will just 'em right back you know they don't th- they'll send 'em back to school sick or 

173.07 174.37 B: yeah 

176.76 185.63 A: they're just not doing their part and so it falls on the teacher but if you want the children to learn anything you have to then start being the parent as well 

178.61 179.73 B: absolutely 

186.03 190.87 B: you're right you're right yeah i mean that's i think that that's probably the key and and um 

191.30 203.10 B: out here in in los angeles there's as many private schools as there are public schools it seems like around that the majority of the people out here do send their kids to public schools 

196.21 197.25 A: (( mhm )) 

202.67 203.84 A: yeah 

203.18 207.55 B: uh and a couple of friends of mine actually are substitute teachers in the public system 

207.10 208.17 A: (( mhm )) 

207.51 212.25 B: and they really really really talk down about the public system 

211.57 213.00 A: really 

212.15 223.88 B: yeah because of the whole system and how it works and and things just like that to where the kids arrive and they're not taken care of and then they're at the school and they're just another number 

221.00 222.15 A: yeah 

223.71 232.65 B: and they just kind of get shuffled in and out of their classes and into the next subject and it's just they don't really take much from it 

227.74 229.89 A: right right 

232.06 236.27 A: yeah and it is it's harder to involve the parents when you have so many kids 

235.91 237.10 B: absolutely 

236.30 240.60 A: you know i know in the private system um [lipsmack] it just [cough] 

240.73 245.81 A: it's really cheap down here i don't know much the private schools are out there but here they're like dirt cheap 

245.56 246.65 B: really 

245.78 256.49 A: but yeah they're really cheap so like a- about a hundred and twenty dollars a month or something like that no and but what they do is i mean if your kid doesn't do his homework 

250.31 252.16 B: oh that's not bad at all 

256.35 257.30 B: mhm 

256.65 263.63 A: after about six weeks if he's like consistently not doing his homework you have to go before the school board for review and they'll kick him out 

263.43 264.50 B: right 

263.87 266.26 A: you know they they can do that so 

266.40 271.95 A: you know if they're not keeping up or they're not participating or whatever they just they get rid of him 

271.88 275.41 B: and it just well that- that's good i mean that that keeps the um 

275.08 276.03 A: right 

275.83 278.57 B: keeps the the everything up 

278.07 289.86 A: right and they don't allow like bullying or teasing or you know the kinda things that's just terrible at public schools that if your child is being teased or something oh you know it's a nightmare for them to go to school 

284.19 285.28 B: right 

289.54 290.78 B: absolutely 

290.16 293.43 A: but the privates don't allow it you know they kick 'em right out 

293.30 302.92 B: and do you think that maybe that will kind of does that put too much of a cover over over kids and doesn't really open their 

302.73 314.07 B: their eyes up to the real world that there are going to be people that don't like them for who they are and and and really let them start learning that from the beginning because i know when i was growing up 

313.95 326.92 B: if you didn't get along with somebody you just had you learned to deal with it and you kind of dealt with it in that time and and i kinda find that maybe the public school s- or the the private kinda babies people a little bit too much 

317.03 318.55 A: mhm 

325.65 333.38 A: kinda protect them a little bit too much yeah they do come out a little bit naive [laughter] 

327.32 328.86 B: a little bit too much 

329.94 334.25 B: right and and think that they're maybe a step higher than everybody else 

333.55 343.21 A: right yeah they're kinda naive and because they're not exposed to you know the real world everything is very polite you know everything is very respectful you do your work 

340.22 341.09 B: yes 

343.37 346.31 A: um you know ev- everything's kinda peachy 

346.17 347.11 B: (( right [cough] )) 

346.43 354.00 A: um but on the other hand you know god i wouldn't wanna have one of those kids like you see on the talk shows that quit school because they're you know 

354.07 357.69 A: they were bullied and teased to death and they just couldn't do it anymore 

355.77 356.78 B: you're right 

357.87 359.89 A: you know i wouldn't want that either 

359.59 362.90 B: absolutely and i i i agree 

360.23 361.51 A: but 

362.59 372.24 A: i think i don't know what the answer is for the public i mean whether it is um to make more parental involvement or make stricter rules um 

372.44 375.60 A: i i don't think they're strict enough as far as academics go 

375.65 376.66 B: right 

376.01 378.56 A: because they pretty much let you flunk your way through 

378.69 379.54 B: yeah 

378.73 382.12 A: um [laughter] 

379.62 385.06 B: exactly it's kinda it's your choice and they don't really take a stand when you start getting below 

384.85 390.00 A: yeah and i think that it's too easy to get kinda lost in the system and not 

389.19 390.03 B: yeah 

389.78 401.34 A: be able to make it so i think they need to toughen up their standards and just do academics and i don't know i think they put too much money into sports and all this extra stuff 

390.95 392.55 B: right right 

401.14 407.25 B: yeah yeah there there there should be those options but really start um 

407.45 414.16 B: getting their priorities straight on on what's needed the most and then work down from there because i think 

409.22 410.33 A: yeah 

414.22 416.82 B: extra curricula activities are 

416.79 427.33 B: a a really good thing for kids to get 'em well rounded and and to get their their eyes opened a little bit wider to other opportunities but they should always always 

423.42 424.34 A: uh-huh 

427.12 441.01 B: make education in the classroom top priority and with a lot of the uh public schools it seems like they get those things out of whack and there's kids transferring all over the united states they go to different schools to play football basketball 

438.14 439.48 A: yeah 

440.35 443.63 A: yeah yeah [laughter] 

441.50 444.35 B: it just doesn't [laughter] it just doesn't seem right to me 

443.94 450.18 A: yeah i mean i i think the public schools can offer more as far as extra curricula activities than the private can 

449.88 451.07 B: mhm 

450.50 463.41 A: but you know they can get kind out of hand because they put so much emphasis on certain activities and you know they don't they don't push the academic stuff hard so now you know we have this country of of people who are 

458.74 460.69 B: right right 

463.70 469.89 A: mostly getting a.'s and b.'s you know when back in the fifties and stuff you know you were lucky if you got a c. 

469.52 470.94 B: mhm 

470.39 474.37 A: and they're not as well educated i mean they come out and they're just kinda 

474.44 479.00 A: you know they don't their their writing skills are not as good their 

479.08 482.61 A: their knowledge of history and things like that are just not as good 

481.94 483.13 B: right 

482.85 485.78 A: so i don't know i think all that kinda bothers me 

485.44 498.07 B: [laughter] yeah i i think so too i think that's just something that that can be worked on and and it just seems like it's not [noise] that people aren't really working on that to to right to raise the level a little bit 

492.94 494.16 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

497.57 499.96 A: now did you go to school out there in l. a. 

499.68 502.71 B: no i went to uh school in kansas actually 

502.27 502.83 A: (( [lipsmack] )) 

502.78 505.71 B: a small town in kansas yeah 

502.90 504.03 A: (( oh really )) 

504.81 506.44 A: what kind of a school did you go to 

506.23 511.75 B: uh it was a public school it was the only school in the town um 

511.78 524.11 B: and i don't know i mean we got exposed to everything and i wouldn't take back my upbringing at all because i had so many different opportunities and in a town like that it 

515.59 516.94 A: mhm 

522.23 528.35 A: yeah it yeah it sounds like it's pretty good if you've got a small town and it's really nice you know 

526.66 530.26 B: mhm yeah and it was a nice community and 

529.79 534.05 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

530.37 539.88 B: everybody got out there and knew one another and knew about your kids and your and you knew the parents of the kids and everybody just kind of knew each other so 

539.94 542.58 B: there's there's a strong foundation that's for sure 

542.04 545.42 A: yeah i mean that sounds kinda nice what what town 

543.80 546.27 B: yeah you grew up out in texas 

546.10 560.55 A: no heck no i grew up in maryland but yeah i went to a public school and it was pretty good i mean it was similar it was um [lipsmack] pretty high standards and everything but like down here i mean they just struggle and struggle 'cause there's a lot of poverty 

548.18 549.58 B: oh in maryland 

560.66 561.87 B: oh yeah 

560.85 575.59 A: and yeah [laughter] so you and you know um [lipsmack] when you know i say the parents uh the parents don't do their jobs well enough well they're not able to 'cause down here it's like um [lipsmack] i think the statistic is seventy percent of the kids are on the free lunch program 

575.70 577.40 B: oh my god 

576.69 580.54 A: and you know normally when you were at high school it was like what ten to twenty percent 

580.14 581.73 B: maybe yeah 

580.94 584.66 A: you know [laughter] yeah down here it is seventy percent 

584.47 586.30 B: oh my god 

585.12 589.10 A: seventy percent for the free lunch program so you know 

589.28 595.22 A: th- these people are really poor i mean they're really poor a lot of the parents don't speak any english 

591.49 592.45 B: mhm 

595.13 596.18 B: right 

595.91 599.95 A: so the kids go into school without knowing you know much english
