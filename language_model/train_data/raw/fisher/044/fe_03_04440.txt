269.39 284.18 B: level echelon i don't think we need that many ah assistant vice principals a- and so on where now you say you need another principal well i think we have ah too many ah higher ups in our our system 

279.46 280.50 A: (( mhm )) 

283.54 285.34 A: right right 

284.39 291.64 B: right but of course now we're not a big city like philadelphia we're just a little you know a little little town 

291.13 294.08 A: oh it's a small town this canton oh 

292.50 296.72 B: oh well a- a- actually i live in north canton

299.75 300.71 A: oh okay 

300.40 311.66 B: yeah yeah and ah i mean all the little areas like ah around here there's jackson high school and plains high school and so on you know the various ah 

311.57 317.73 B: ah surrounding areas and oh all of their uh high schools are just fantastic

323.27 324.11 A: oh 

324.54 327.52 A: (( okay mm okay mm )) 

326.10 332.24 B: right but i mean it's getting o- o- out of hand of what they keep asking for 

331.99 332.99 A: (( oh okay )) 

333.02 346.08 B: it's entirely too much and i mean i i think they need kids need a good education but i don't think you need all of the [mn] uh these all these trimmings ah to give them a good education 

338.87 339.75 A: (( well a- )) 

341.01 342.93 A: all the trimmings [laughter] 

343.46 344.43 A: no 

345.28 350.74 A: -cation yeah i'm all for that but the trimming that go along with it isn't necessary 

350.24 352.02 B: e- exactly 

351.41 358.19 A: and plus they they they they go and destroy you know they they not about not keeping nothing up wi- wi- wi- a- 

358.02 368.38 A: a- a- a- and that the the next class or or or semester come along that will appreciate how nice it was you know what i mean they you know 

366.65 367.98 B: that's right 

368.00 369.19 B: mhm 

368.43 368.97 A: (( s- )) 

369.08 376.97 B: yeah and then another thing oh the school needs this new they need that new well you know when you own your own house 

376.78 391.70 B: every year you gotta do some maintenance on it you just can't let it go and say oh i need a whole new roof if you have a if you have a leak in the roof you go up and you patch it you don't wait 'til the whole thing falls apart a- 

383.79 386.66 A: right right right [laughter] 

388.09 389.08 A: right 

390.78 392.52 A: (( before you get you get a roof )) 

392.47 399.20 B: that's right so i i think they should better maintain what they do have and take care of it 

392.88 395.09 A: yeah [laughter] 

398.64 402.94 A: (( right right mm mm mm )) 

400.69 412.75 B: and and the surrounding area they just uh they had this levy on and and it uh didn't pass it uh for eleven tries on the ballot and it finally passed 

412.66 419.22 B: and there was enough room to build uh they did need additional classrooms and there was enough 

418.99 431.99 B: of an area to build additional an addition onto the school but oh they didn't want that they went out and and spent five million dollars for another piece of land to to build a whole new high school 

431.37 434.38 A: (( oh wow five million )) 

432.75 433.74 B: you know 

433.95 440.06 B: right for a piece a land because oh i don't how many acres it is 

434.83 436.99 A: (( mm )) 

439.84 454.78 B: and then all the kids today go to school they have their own cars you know you supply busing i don't think then they need cars where now you don't have that problem in the city because you know they they more or less walk or would use public transport 

444.20 445.22 A: yeah 

449.68 451.11 A: no no 

453.50 455.32 A: public transportation 

454.73 455.80 B: right 

455.81 464.56 A: (( but out there you definitely need a car to get from i mean not definitely but it's more convenient to get from one place to the next )) 

458.06 458.67 B: mm 

464.01 465.11 B: right 

464.62 465.41 A: (( okay )) 

465.18 467.17 B: right mhm 

466.79 468.13 A: (( mm mm mm )) 

467.20 472.23 B: but i i think really the school system needs a real good overhauling 

472.37 477.53 B: and then the teachers are always complaining that they aren't paid enough 

476.54 478.64 A: (( paid enough [laughter] )) 

477.75 489.27 B: but when you stop and think i think they don't put in an eight hour day i have a teacher next door and she's home here at three thirty in the afternoons on her patio 

482.52 484.10 A: (( no never )) 

486.22 488.63 A: [laughter] 

488.66 492.86 A: (( yeah you be you be wondering does she go to work [laughter] when you see her )) 

491.33 505.18 B: right exa- exactly you know when you stop and figure what they make when you figure the hours that they put in i mean it's a pretty darn good salary and then they're always complaining that it isn't enough 

502.76 504.07 A: (( complaining )) 

504.53 507.22 A: (( just something ain't it they tell me they want [lipsmack] )) 

507.48 514.24 A: (( they wanna get the kinda p- pay well this is what they say in philadelphia they wanna get the kinda pay that the policemen get )) 

514.27 515.31 B: right 

514.91 526.18 A: because they feel as though they in danger messing with these k- some of these crazy kids just like the policeman would be when he out on the street protecting the citizens 

521.12 522.19 B: (( right [sigh] [sigh] )) 

526.49 535.33 A: that's that's their argument we wanna get the same kinda money and the same kinda benefits that the police officers get or the firemen 

534.66 536.64 B: right right 

536.76 548.03 B: mhm but you know years ago you never had such problems that they had to deal with and where do you think these problems come from i think it's the parents 

537.69 538.42 A: (( [laughter] )) 

547.38 550.72 A: i think it's the parents i'm pretty sure it's the parents 

548.38 550.07 B: and it's at home 

550.10 564.50 B: r- right i mean you didn't well i came uh fr- uh from a family that always had hunters you know and you had h- uh uh uh uh rifles and guns and all but you just knew that you weren't supposed to touch those 

556.28 557.87 A: right mhm 

562.50 565.08 A: supposed to touch 'em you right 

564.48 570.21 B: and today's kids i mean you say no to them and they turn around and laugh at you i mean 

568.91 572.60 A: yeah or turn around and kill you [laughter] 

570.63 580.04 B: or y- yeah k- kill you but i i think a lot of it has to do with the parents and they have to do more in the home with these kids 

579.43 590.88 A: (( yeah instead of just letting them stay on one of them joysticks or you know what i mean or in front of that boob tube that boob tube is another terrible uh uh mind destroyer )) 

584.44 585.39 B: yes 

586.36 587.41 B: yes 

590.44 599.44 B: oh there's nothing good on t._v. anymore we enjoy watching in the evening but nine times out of ten there isn't anything decent on to watch 

598.12 599.89 A: no no
