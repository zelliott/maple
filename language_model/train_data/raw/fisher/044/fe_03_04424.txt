18.74 20.48 B: i'm doing pretty well 

20.06 22.82 A: well they gave us a hard question didn't they 

22.79 31.46 B: uh yeah [laughter] is this is this your uh first call or have you done it before okay yeah i did this 

23.79 25.48 A: [laughter] 

28.00 29.30 A: yes 

31.48 34.12 B: uh twice before a- 

32.85 36.52 A: i was waiting to enter a pin number or something 

37.40 39.93 B: oh y- oh you haven't done that 

39.25 42.05 A: uh well i have before i think well th- 

42.11 46.34 A: there's a couple of surveys that i do and this may be one that 

46.72 49.01 A: is uh with the fisher 

49.49 51.68 B: yeah that's right 

49.98 52.74 A: okay this is my second call then 

52.95 54.03 B: okay 

53.59 54.60 A: okay 

54.62 65.68 A: well so we're just supposed to discuss uh friendship and if they gave us a million dollars we could never speak to our best friend again [laughter] 

65.15 67.10 B: [laughter] yeah 

65.61 71.10 A: well my best friend's my husband so that would [laughter] that's almost impossible 

68.96 69.92 B: [laughter] 

70.74 72.53 B: that's not an option then 

71.98 74.00 A: [laughter] not at all 

72.86 73.58 B: y- 

73.93 76.51 B: yeah i i would ah 

76.55 79.52 B: not accept the million dollars 

79.71 81.08 B: i 

80.05 83.69 A: there would be so many things attached to it 

83.64 93.15 B: yeah i mean i don't know i value my friends more than well family first but after that my friends more than more than anything 

91.02 92.29 A: right 

93.83 95.16 A: that's true 

93.94 95.80 B: (( [sigh] a- and )) 

96.24 101.59 B: yeah there's other ways of finding income 

101.61 103.42 B: than doing that so 

104.91 106.18 B: that's what i would say 

106.08 108.65 A: yeah that's probably about true because 

108.73 117.37 A: you know if if your best friend is a family member well that's just totally unacceptable you couldn't make that choice 

117.86 123.86 A: 'cause f- friends are irreplaceable you know if if they've been there for you there perhaps was 

124.10 127.10 B: yeah yeah i would definitely i mean it's [mn] 

127.20 137.44 B: you go thr- i mean from my from my experience i've been through a lot of friends and when you find the really good ones it's you know it's a good thing to have 

136.82 139.94 A: that's true you may only find one in your life 

140.06 142.08 B: that's yeah that's right 

141.48 146.15 A: that you can really trust and count on to be there for you when you need 'em 

146.39 147.76 B: yeah 

147.19 148.50 A: that's true 

151.66 153.87 B: (( [lipsmack] yeah i don't know i mean )) 

154.36 157.56 B: a million dollars is [mn] it would be nice 

156.98 158.05 A: yeah 

157.57 161.22 B: but that's yeah 

160.40 166.70 A: well they say on that commercial that certain things are priceless i guess and 

167.07 168.49 B: right right 

169.11 170.44 B: yeah 

169.80 182.94 A: try and ke- keep in contact with your best friends because you may lose contact with 'em for a while you know because everybody goes on with their life but it's a friend you'll always remember and they will be in your heart 

183.44 184.73 B: yeah 

183.54 186.57 A: no no matter where you go in the world 

189.43 191.30 A: and always remember 'em 

191.60 198.35 A: so i'd say no too that the million dollars wouldn't be worth losing your best friend 

197.60 199.73 B: yeah 

198.81 201.61 A: i guess money can't buy you everything huh 

201.43 202.62 B: [laughter] 

201.81 206.70 A: [laughter] i mean it can buy you friends but they won't be there for you 

203.00 204.27 B: yeah 

206.71 210.71 A: like a true friend they'll be there to spend your million dollars [laughter] 

210.11 213.56 B: [laughter] that's yeah that's right [mn] 

210.87 211.91 A: [laughter] 

213.51 217.05 A: so in order to have way to have friends lined up down the road 

216.71 217.88 B: (( [laughter] )) 

217.71 220.57 A: but it wouldn't been like a friend that's been there 

220.67 222.53 B: yeah 

222.62 223.95 B: that's true 

223.87 225.97 A: (( through like thick and thin )) 

228.77 229.98 A: you need someone 

229.06 233.70 B: i won- uh i wonder if uh if that's ever actually happened though 

233.93 234.98 B: someone 

234.16 235.51 A: i don't know 

235.14 239.24 B: who's left in a will with some stipulation like that 

239.81 243.80 A: that's probably going to be the next movie huh [laughter] 

242.42 243.44 B: [laughter] 

245.50 246.22 A: but 

245.54 247.40 B: (( yeah )) 

247.54 252.80 B: there's actually a movie that came out a a long time ago i think it was in the eighties 

253.05 255.05 B: called brewster's millions 

255.22 257.14 A: i did see that 

255.39 256.21 B: (( [lipsmack] a- a- )) 

257.00 260.21 B: [laughter] um and it's i mean it was 

260.64 265.58 B: different but had it was kind of similar in certain ways [lipsmack] 

264.96 267.03 A: yeah it sure is 

267.86 270.18 B: i don't i at least i remember in that movie 

270.51 276.34 B: [cough] it really put a strain on the uh the friendship of john candy and richard pryor 

275.99 276.94 A: yeah 

278.76 286.76 B: i think yeah i think if you started dealing with lots of money in- involving it with your friends it's just going to end in a big mess 

286.51 290.06 A: yeah 'cause other friends probably intimidate him 

290.43 293.08 B: yeah yeah 

291.41 294.18 A: like money changes people too 

294.20 296.10 B: yeah it definitely does 

295.59 299.80 A: so i'll just stay with what i got i'm a housewife my husband works but 

299.93 303.10 A: you know we're happy and we got love in our house so 

303.18 307.04 A: that no amount of money can can replace that 

306.32 308.35 B: yeah that's great that's 

308.54 309.81 B: (( [lipsmack] that's nice )) 

309.24 310.85 A: are you married 

310.63 312.80 B: (( um no i'm not married )) 

311.95 313.88 A: well you're young though 

314.02 314.65 A: so 

314.12 315.92 B: (( y- yeah )) 

314.69 316.23 A: you live your life 

317.04 318.57 B: (( yeah i think i )) 

317.60 318.87 A: for a little while 

319.20 320.64 B: excuse me 

320.01 324.15 A: i said live your life for a little while before you get married and tie yourself down 

324.08 330.86 B: yeah yeah i've been um dating a girl from college who i graduated with um 

331.20 333.44 B: for about a year and half now 

333.42 336.70 A: well that's great that's a committed relationship 

336.12 339.37 B: yeah [laughter] no no it is it is it's going well 

337.54 341.50 A: see that's my situation she's your best friend [laughter] 

340.91 343.65 B: [laughter] no she is definitely uh 

342.88 343.99 A: yes 

343.81 345.08 B: yeah 

344.64 348.31 A: so we both have to say no to the million dollars wouldn't we 

348.34 349.31 A: [laughter] 

348.52 352.39 B: yeah yeah i think most people would although 

352.53 361.39 B: i'm sure there are some who would just be looking for money or maybe they don't even have really good good friends so in that case then it's a 

354.82 355.70 A: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

359.22 360.05 A: yeah 

361.65 363.74 B: an easy answer for them 

363.57 370.05 A: well i'd say that's about everyone's answer if they really had a true friend and knows what friendship is 

369.46 376.97 B: yeah yeah no i mean my best guy friend uh we've been friends for about 

377.19 381.47 B: nine years now just best friends and i mean 

382.00 388.51 B: [cough] when i have problems i'll turn to him and the same thing with him and [cough] it's it's great 

385.77 386.76 A: right 

387.84 390.28 A: yeah you can depend on one another 

390.31 392.70 B: yeah yeah yeah 

391.82 396.02 A: even it's just you know face to face or over the telephone talking 

396.08 398.88 A: you probably comfort one another that way 

399.07 400.52 B: (( it's yeah )) 

401.46 404.35 A: so he's not worth a million or you wouldn't 

404.40 407.22 A: [lipsmack] stop your friendship for a million dollars would you 

406.94 408.69 B: (( mm no )) 

408.24 409.21 A: no 

411.48 412.34 A: [lipsmack] i don't 

411.50 416.18 B: that's what that's why we're good friends [laughter] we see eye to eye like that 

413.98 415.51 A: that's right 

416.31 422.29 A: yeah 'cause well good friends maybe uh girls come between 'em sometimes but 

422.09 424.00 B: yeah 

422.62 425.78 A: they they still stay friends through thick and thin 

427.45 433.34 A: i guess that's what part of a fr- a best friend is you know there for you when you really need 'em 

433.92 435.74 B: (( yeah y- oh yeah )) 

435.98 437.71 B: otherwise they 

438.38 439.99 B: wouldn't be that great 

439.70 442.93 A: yeah there's not too many you can count on neither 

442.78 443.67 B: [laughter] 

443.38 447.72 A: so if you get one that's there and you say nine years that's a long time 

448.06 451.48 B: yeah yeah no it's he's a great guy 

453.23 457.14 B: but yeah so how long have you been married for 

456.99 459.86 A: fourteen years [laughter] 

458.49 459.63 B: wow 

459.68 460.92 B: congratulations 

460.72 466.08 A: two kids got one boy fourteen and one girl she'll soon be eleven 

467.12 468.16 A: (( so )) 

468.10 469.71 B: [laughter] 

468.64 473.42 A: so that's why i say he's my best friend i wouldn't trade him for ten million dollars 

472.78 478.01 B: [laughter] yeah yeah well i think that's the case in most uh 

473.60 474.72 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

478.29 485.88 B: happy marriages that your spouse becomes your best friend that that's the case with my parents at least [mn] 

483.03 483.94 A: yeah 

486.06 491.88 A: probably friends before you know spouse well it just grows bigger and bigger 

491.87 493.99 B: yeah yeah 

495.54 499.73 A: yeah when you've been together that long it's hard to imagine your life without one another 

500.05 502.49 B: (( [mn] yeah i it's )) 

502.54 504.83 B: yeah definitely 

504.35 507.87 A: so you been committed for a little while you got a good start 

507.97 509.04 B: [laughter] 

508.40 511.62 A: most people don't last a year [laughter] 

510.98 512.66 B: yeah [laughter] it's 

512.68 514.70 B: yeah
