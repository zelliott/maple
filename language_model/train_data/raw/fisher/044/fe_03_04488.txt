29.88 30.91 B: okay 

31.46 41.65 B: okay what what do you think about parental choice giving parents the choice to enroll their sons and daughters in in private schools with vouchers 

41.87 43.48 B: would

45.29 47.03 B: (( you think it's a good idea )) 

46.43 48.26 A: yeah 

47.56 51.80 B: so you would encourage enrollment in in private schools 

51.76 52.58 A: yes 

52.64 54.16 B: and wh- why would you 

54.22 58.19 A: because then they can learn moral values 

57.99 59.02 B: (( yes )) 

59.26 60.89 A: yeah 

60.06 65.65 B: yeah i i'm i'm a big fa- i'm a big fan of vouchers you know 

65.36 66.47 A: mhm 

65.80 67.25 B: but uh 

67.50 75.45 B: unfortunately unfortunately in this country is not a popular idea so far i think that it can 

75.69 81.21 B: we can we are moving towards that uh i read that in colorado 

81.48 86.69 B: (( governor alwin owens already in- already signed legislation )) 

86.93 92.48 B: where they are instituting vouchers here in d._c. uh 

92.62 100.84 B: mayor williams already said that uh he supports the government bush initiative on vouchers 

101.16 103.95 B: and uh i think that in florida 

103.96 106.47 B: governor bush has uh 

106.31 120.43 B: has tried something like that i i heard that also in i don't know er if i'm right but it i think it's wisconsin the state that implemented vouchers and and apparently it was also being really good 

119.73 121.46 A: mhm 

120.70 122.41 B: yeah 

122.43 125.91 B: so where where do you attend where do you attend school 

126.10 131.53 A: [mn] i attended at uh public high school ri- right now i'm currently not attending 

131.96 133.40 B: okay where 

133.82 136.06 A: you mean where was my school 

135.55 136.76 B: yeah 

136.56 137.99 A: oh wisconsin 

137.77 142.25 B: oh wisconsin there you go i think that they they they implemented vouchers there 

141.76 146.08 A: yeah i went to a private school earlier on before high school 

145.89 148.62 B: okay and how was it 

148.18 151.91 A: it was pretty cool most of the teachers were 

149.89 150.74 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

151.93 154.44 A: volunteer they had very low key 

156.62 157.49 A: mhm 

157.23 158.24 B: that's fine 

158.52 161.86 B: that's fine yeah i attended a public school 

162.08 163.60 B: and uh 

164.36 171.26 B: well to be honest everything i was taught i i just forgot i just forgot it i don't remember it any more 

169.82 172.41 A: yeah same here 

172.27 173.73 B: but uh 

174.02 186.81 B: i think that the that other the the sad thing about about public schools is that they encourage uniformity among students 

187.22 191.01 B: and for example if someone is really really good in math 

190.73 192.25 A: mhm 

191.50 195.41 B: but is bad for social studies the system 

195.47 206.13 B: tries to lower this student's capacity in math and try to improve his capacity in social studies instead of being the otherwise instead of encouraging his math 

205.96 211.03 B: and not forcing him to study something he he's not good at you know 

210.65 212.46 A: yeah 

211.38 216.28 B: i had this fr- friend of mine from high school he was really really smart 

216.07 228.38 B: and he hated math and he was really good into social social studies and oh he drop out of school just because of that because the system tends to uniformity it doesn't encourage good students 

228.24 232.20 B: at something to pursue their their 

232.46 233.46 B: (( interest )) 

232.48 235.06 A: what they're good at yeah 

233.61 235.80 B: yeah so 

235.89 238.19 B: so did did you complete high school 

237.98 239.85 A: yeah 

238.79 241.57 B: uh do do you go to to college 

241.70 242.90 A: um no no 

242.74 243.59 B: no 

243.86 246.69 B: okay what what do you do currently 

246.63 251.98 A: right now i'm uh i'm a home builder with my father he owns a business 

252.09 252.89 B: okay 

253.52 254.75 B: okay cool 

255.14 257.13 B: (( yeah i )) 

257.65 259.65 B: i think that uh 

259.79 261.83 B: i think that there will be importance 

262.35 269.56 B: if if i think that vouchers are a great idea i'm not i'm not quite uh 

270.27 279.59 B: quite well read on um the technicalities of it you know some people talk about giving tax credits other people talk about uh 

274.19 275.02 A: mhm 

279.75 280.79 B: (( uh )) 

280.85 282.33 B: just giving er 

282.54 291.17 B: tax money directly to parent to parents so they can involve with that money with those bonuses with those vouchers 

290.71 299.69 A: yeah and so the government can put so much towards a small war you know and you'd think they'd be able to do some vouchers 

296.78 297.72 B: yeah 

299.73 313.57 B: yeah so well that's this it's idea that needs needs to be explored but i work uh it's one of the subjects where we are insisting more on on that i work in a publishing 

314.12 315.37 B: and uh 

315.38 317.20 B: (( precisely we had a )) 

317.30 320.02 B: a conference today in our 

320.45 326.58 B: in our institute on on educational freedom in america 

324.72 326.40 A: yeah 

326.98 331.55 B: and uh we also published a book recently on 

331.69 346.43 B: on the constitutional battle over vouchers you know because there is on constitutional also constitutional issue there for example that with tax money parents can enroll their their their 

346.73 348.89 B: theirs sons and daughters into 

349.10 353.56 B: catholic er catholic er schools 

353.25 354.43 A: (( oh mhm )) 

353.61 363.68 B: uh there is a question of constitutionality there because is is government money being used to uh promote a certain fate 

363.77 371.95 B: so that's one of the one of the issues that was raised to the constitutional court to supreme court uh mhm 

369.81 371.00 A: yeah but 

371.02 374.20 A: not all schools are catholic like 

373.52 375.96 B: yeah not all schools are catholic 

375.79 377.20 B: (( but uh )) 

377.01 378.57 B: that was raised 

378.37 387.71 B: to the con- to the supreme court and the supreme court ruled that that it didn't violate the first amendment so it was a major 

387.59 394.77 B: major victory for the voucher movement and right now what what we believe 

394.86 397.42 B: (( in um school choice )) 

397.56 404.52 B: are are awaiting is like governors governors like bush in florida and owens in in colorado 

404.72 415.73 B: who they just try to and go ahead stop the talking and try to implement these programs i think that we should we should keep looking at colorado as an example and see what what what's 

413.78 414.84 A: (( yeah mhm mhm )) 

415.90 417.13 B: going on there 

418.46 421.08 B: yeah and uh 

421.24 422.44 B: (( well the the )) 

422.64 424.97 B: the easy example is also 

425.29 431.74 B: is you know do you know this is this is really important because most are very little politician 

431.98 434.94 B: like who oppose uh vouchers 

435.74 441.77 B: and when you do a research i think that the heritage foundation did a research on on 

441.79 444.14 B: on house members 

444.47 450.78 B: of uh that are opposing vouchers most of them enrolled their sons and daughters 

450.91 454.26 B: in their children into private schools 

454.28 455.90 A: and they oppose it 

455.49 457.04 B: and they oppose it 

456.49 457.47 A: why 

457.79 470.27 B: so yeah there is that there is a big hypocrisy there there there they oppose vouchers which in in to someone is giving poor parents the option to enroll uh 

470.45 474.68 B: to enroll their their children in in good private schools 

475.07 483.18 B: because they the the wealthy will always have the choice not to send their their children to to public schools and send them to private ones 

483.41 489.53 B: is the poor the ones that lacks the money so that's that's revealing you know uh 

489.76 495.66 B: seeing that the double spe- the double standards that most politicians er 

496.38 497.48 B: have 

497.68 499.49 B: in this in this subject 

497.69 499.17 A: mhm 

499.95 502.16 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

501.14 502.41 B: yeah so 

502.70 504.91 B: so it will be good if 

505.23 507.30 B: if we can 

507.57 508.70 B: we can 

509.13 513.66 B: go ahead and and promote these and foster 

514.03 516.13 B: vouchers and school choice 

516.17 517.32 A: mhm 

516.28 525.07 B: i think that uh it will help not on- not only this country but the whole the whole continent i think if we can 

525.05 534.15 B: we can if the united states can export this idea to latin american countries i know that for example nicaragua er 

534.01 542.93 B: enroll areas in nicaragua i think i've heard that some kind of voucher system has been implemented 

543.31 546.87 B: and i think in costa rica where i'm from uh 

547.35 548.79 B: vouchers 

548.81 551.87 B: are being introduced into the public debate 

552.98 557.18 B: because unfortunately the the the 

557.84 567.26 B: the system the public system works in in totally different way the more you spend apparently the results get worse you know 

567.33 568.27 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

567.98 571.70 B: so that's why we need to explore different options 

573.17 576.62 B: yeah and uh so you're in wisconsin 

576.25 577.96 A: yeah 

577.05 578.63 B: ah how's the weather down there 

578.62 582.17 A: oh it's finally getting nice and the trees are

582.41 583.41 A: budding 

583.16 584.47 B: is it still chilly 

584.63 586.93 A: oh it's not cold no more 

586.93 588.18 B: it's not cold 

587.59 591.45 A: maybe to somebody who lives in a warmer climate 

590.27 596.18 B: yeah i i had the worst experience with this summer ah with this winter here in d._c. 

596.21 597.60 A: mhm 

596.65 599.89 B: but uh well i think this is still chilly
