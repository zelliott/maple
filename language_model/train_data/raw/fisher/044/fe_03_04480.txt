16.00 16.77 A: (( uh-huh )) 

16.71 18.37 B: where are you from 

17.75 18.62 A: maine 

18.77 19.51 B: maine 

19.92 22.04 B: well how's the weather there 

21.91 25.32 A: uh it's been a very cold spring [laughter] 

24.07 26.66 B: really it's pretty warm here 

25.71 26.89 A: cold and wet 

26.89 29.21 B: oh i bet i know they say 

28.09 29.95 A: and a long winter this year 

29.93 31.45 B: is it 

30.94 34.95 A: it was yeah yeah it it was in the fifties today 

35.25 37.28 B: oh that's not too bad 

36.04 40.47 A: but no no spring is slow to arrive 

40.76 44.36 A: uh i understand we're supposed to comment on public schools 

44.07 45.27 B: yes 

46.19 47.68 A: do you have any opinions 

47.54 53.20 B: well there's good and bad about it i mean where i grew up in uh florida they had uh 

53.41 57.79 B: public schools were pretty bad down there a lot of crime rates and stuff but uh 

58.43 65.20 B: some of the teachers didn't really seem to care about the the students or whatnot but then you had a selective few teachers that did you know 

65.72 69.87 B: but uh but out here in louisville in texas it seems a little better 

71.45 73.40 B: how are the schools out there 

74.27 75.16 A: well 

75.97 79.35 A: actually i think all things considered probably 

79.40 85.14 A: maine's education system is in pretty good uh standing compared to the rest of the nation but 

83.23 83.91 B: (( oh )) 

85.93 89.82 A: up to the fourth grade we have the highest reading scores in the country 

89.84 95.56 A: but grades four through twelve there seems to be a serious decline and 

89.91 91.11 B: really 

95.86 103.58 A: i'm not sure i can point my finger at the exact cause but i think i think we have a lot of parental interference 

103.85 113.96 A: we have a lot of parents that are making demands on the school system that perhaps are unjustified and i think that interferes a little bit with the daily operation of the schools 

109.85 110.56 B: (( mm )) 

114.39 115.31 A: uh 

116.18 119.60 A: it's my perception that what has really happened is 

120.02 123.91 A: that educators don't have control over education 

124.64 127.80 A: and i think the older the kids get 

127.83 130.75 A: the less control the educators have over 

131.05 132.64 A: the educational process 

133.63 135.44 A: i'm not sure how to correct it 

135.70 150.12 B: yeah i know out here it seems like the school system i just knew in in this metroplex over here it seems like they're highly rated i know plainer has really great schools and they rave a lot about them the students seem to 

150.13 155.77 B: have a lot of activities and and i just think that parents need to get more involved than what they are right now 

156.51 158.29 A: well that's probably a good thing 

158.96 160.91 B: that they're not or they are 

160.51 162.11 A: that they are involved 

162.02 164.11 B: yeah well they need to be you know 

164.38 177.04 B: that's definitely i know my parents were involved with us when we were in school too but there's a difference between it seems like with public schools and private schools because i went to a private school for about a year or so and it just seems 

177.08 187.46 B: totally different just i guess if they it seems like a lot of schools in dallas are adopting uh dress codes as far as you know a blue 

187.84 191.30 B: navy shirt and white pants or black pants you know 

191.60 197.75 B: that way kids don't have to worry about certain clothes that they're wearing or certain clothes that they buy and all that or 

195.40 196.25 A: right 

196.26 202.19 A: they don't have to be concerned about keeping up with the joneses [laughter] yeah when they're all dressed the same way 

199.73 201.18 B: right or 

201.53 209.92 B: yeah or gang colors and all that ridiculous stuff can focus more on education which is good but i think public schools are good for 

203.89 204.69 A: right 

210.59 222.81 B: more so than just education they're adapting to other things too you know intermingling with adults and i think learning commonsense also you know 'cause you have cliques in in schools also 

222.42 223.63 A: oh for sure 

223.06 226.30 B: so i think their mind more so 'cause i know my wife was home schooled 

226.47 234.98 B: and i know that there's things that home school that i saw that's different with public school because i was raised in a public school so i see where there is different things 

235.37 244.09 B: where it seems home school kids adapt better with adults more so than kids i guess that go to public school 

243.28 252.08 A: i think that's probably right and they probably don't get some of the social skills of uh age group though that they otherwise would get by being in the public 

244.79 245.77 B: so 

248.06 250.78 B: right 

251.86 259.95 B: and i think it's one of the the good things about public school that you do get not just education you get education on other things as well as just in the books 

255.39 256.21 A: right 

260.03 266.47 A: right unfortunately you also get subject to a number of put downs [laughter] 

260.15 262.29 B: so you get the street smarts i guess 

264.89 268.91 B: yeah and that's true too so hopefully you have a uh a stronger 

269.28 272.66 B: foothold you know [laughter] you don't let things bother you so 

272.23 273.47 A: oh that's right 

273.42 277.72 B: 'cause i know i got that growing up but you don't worry about it you don't sweat the small stuff 

276.98 283.18 A: no no and as you get older you sweat the small stuff even less [laughter] 

281.14 284.35 B: [laughter] that's true that is true 

285.23 297.32 B: but i don't know there's a lot of good things i got out of public school i mean they had some great programs and stuff that went above all the crime and all the stuff that we had at the schools and drugs and all that i mean there was i had some good times and good memories there 

296.85 301.57 A: well i think if if you really look at public schools objectively 

301.68 306.50 A: they probably are a mirror image of society at large 

307.13 313.71 A: and they will be as strong or as weak as society allows them to be 

314.37 316.20 A: no more no less 

316.63 317.53 A: uh 

317.72 326.19 A: i do believe very strongly if education were totally in the hands of educators the schools would operate a little differently than they operate right now 

325.97 328.98 B: oh yeah there is a lot of 

327.59 336.42 A: the entire board of education uh i can't speak for your state but in maine the board of education is made up of people that are 

336.82 338.69 A: uh not even 

338.97 343.33 A: skilled in the educational process okay now if you wanted to be an attorney 

340.91 347.35 B: mhm 

343.78 346.68 A: and you passed the maine bar exam 

347.43 351.65 A: all the questions and the board is made up of attorneys 

347.72 348.30 B: (( mm )) 

349.92 356.71 B: mhm 

352.32 353.98 A: not true with education 

354.47 357.54 A: and you know any anybody that 

358.10 359.61 A: is a layperson 

360.34 366.34 A: can be on the state board of education and i i can't in my own mind 

367.66 369.70 A: conceive how they 

370.53 376.40 A: could determine what the good educational process would be or what would be a good quality of school 

376.70 379.35 A: if they don't have an educational background themselves 

379.48 382.25 A: (( i don't think that they have the qualifications to do that )) 

382.23 385.68 B: i agree a lot of it goes down to politics too though 

385.40 387.55 A: oh sure that's right 

385.96 387.39 B: you know they want 

387.41 391.50 B: minorities or this and that in our in our school system and stuff too and it's 

389.76 394.14 A: that's right school is one of the biggest political footballs in the country and 

392.90 394.52 B: oh yeah uh-huh 

394.24 398.76 A: and if there's a place where there should never be any politics it's school 

398.56 399.54 B: yeah 

398.92 403.49 A: but if there's a place where there is politics it's school [laughter] 

401.58 411.40 B: that's true they'll never drop the football team in high school but they'll drop the band team funds in a heartbeat you know because that's what what's bringing in money uh-huh it's true 

405.66 406.81 A: that's right 

407.13 409.54 A: and it's so sad 

411.35 413.04 A: yeah it's true that's right 

411.77 419.93 B: that is very true mhm 

414.02 415.26 A: and uh 

415.77 423.83 A: well i think in recent years well i say in recent years over the last thirty years you know looking back over how education has changed here 

425.12 427.64 A: the school day hasn't gotten any longer 

428.58 432.45 A: but what teachers are expected to impart 

432.77 436.32 A: to the students has increased dramatically 

436.81 439.92 A: and we've gone from reading and writing and arithmetic 

440.48 452.49 A: to having six or seven different subjects in the curriculum and the school's expected to pick up the political football and go with it you know they're expected to feed them lunch they're expected to uh give them a snack break 

452.68 456.70 A: we have schools in maine now that furnish breakfast for kids 

456.71 457.66 B: wow 

457.04 464.48 A: uh health is now a requirement family life is now a requirement i'm not saying that it shouldn't be 

458.98 462.26 B: (( mhm )) 

464.59 469.50 A: but every time that you put some of those things into the school curriculum 

469.74 471.86 A: something else gets bumped a little bit 

471.77 473.05 B: yeah 

472.42 477.63 A: so our our our kids are probably doing better in terms of 

478.60 485.33 A: uh being educated in health and family life and living and probably better educated now on 

485.79 489.71 A: but at the sacrifice of reading and mathematics 

488.92 490.76 B: mhm 

489.77 492.22 A: because those were staples of the curriculum 

492.47 496.74 A: but now they make up a smaller percentage of the instructional time 

497.35 502.37 A: and every time something comes in something else has to go and uh 

503.05 508.35 A: i think that's i think that's you know a real problem and probably on a nationwide scale 

503.10 504.45 B: that is true 

508.26 516.20 B: yeah and they pay school taxes and all that it's just a shame you don't get the vote on what what classes you can have for a kid do you know what i mean 

515.98 517.45 A: oh yeah [laughter] 

516.60 523.49 B: like okay they're gonna have these activities let's all vote on them you know what i mean and but they don't that's what's kind of odd 

525.03 530.20 B: you have to give your money away but you can't have no choice [laughter] you don't have the matter what what's in school systems 

527.86 529.89 A: (( yeah right [laughter] )) 

530.07 533.46 A: well a few things in life that are certain death and taxes 

533.17 538.87 B: that is true yeah not necessarily in that order either [laughter] that is true 

533.49 535.87 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

536.43 537.58 A: that's right 

537.67 538.64 A: (( yeah )) 

539.37 543.96 A: yeah probably in reverse order [laughter] [laughter] 

541.30 543.15 B: yeah that is true 

543.76 553.67 B: that is huh the other are your schools up there are they i mean are they mixed you have a lot of spanish or blacks or whites or 

546.18 546.90 A: (( yeah )) 

552.72 554.41 A: oh gosh no 

554.31 555.17 B: no 

554.59 560.99 A: no uh it's very very rare oh probably in the in the bigger cities you know bangor and uh 

559.66 565.41 B: mhm 

561.56 564.80 A: portland area you probably have some of those but 

565.47 569.83 A: i live in the eastern part i live right near by in the arcadia national park 

570.21 581.77 A: and it's very rare to have a black person here usually they're military okay they're stationed in the navy base or coastguard or their um sorry but their parents usually are stationed at one of the bases 

573.54 580.44 B: (( yeah )) 

582.24 583.26 A: uh 

583.35 590.00 B: so you don't have security pretty strong there do you metal detectors and all that 

586.19 586.93 A: no 

587.60 588.40 A: no 

589.25 592.61 A: no that's not something we have to be concerned about yet 

592.49 595.70 B: yeah hopefully it doesn't go to that 

593.02 593.99 A: (( ah )) 

594.61 596.96 A: it it may be coming to that but 

597.12 599.17 A: we're we're hopeful that it won't
