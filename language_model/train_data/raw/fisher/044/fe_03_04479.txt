19.80 23.07 B: um okay the question being 

23.57 24.76 B: um 

25.14 28.86 B: what do we think of public schools right now and 

29.27 32.33 B: what can be done to improve them 

32.16 33.57 A: mhm 

33.00 34.95 B: is that what you heard 

35.06 38.89 A: that's uh basically what i heard yeah mm 

37.54 38.80 B: okay 

39.00 40.15 B: um 

41.42 45.55 B: ha- have you ever watched a show called street smarts

49.91 52.19 B: it it's on late at night 

52.48 54.10 B: and uh 

54.11 57.67 B: they go around and they ask all kinds of people 

57.75 59.51 B: simple questions 

59.44 60.67 A: mhm 

59.79 62.40 B: um you know like 

64.39 66.99 A: oh it sounds like the jay leno thing too 

66.33 69.00 B: yeah it it's very similar to that 

69.03 71.98 B: okay so you can take the jay leno thing 

72.09 82.74 B: an- and think about this i mean i i've seen school teachers grade school teachers asked questions about you know 

82.94 84.75 B: for instance uh 

85.43 86.59 B: (( um )) 

87.84 90.43 B: who was our first president 

90.02 91.67 A: [laughter] 

91.29 95.14 B: and and the lady did not know 

96.37 98.95 B: you know and i'm wondering 

99.04 100.55 B: how these 

100.74 106.34 B: kids can get along when when their teachers don't know 

106.77 111.45 B: simple facts that when yeah i'm sixty years old 

111.52 115.07 A: okay i got you by a couple of years by the way [laughter] 

112.36 113.22 B: and 

114.34 118.12 B: [laughter] do you well when i was uh 

115.54 116.36 A: yeah 

118.13 124.87 B: when i was in school you know i mean we we learned who the presidents were we learned uh 

124.98 134.23 B: we learned to read and write and if we spoke incorrectly we were corrected 

128.28 129.56 A: (( mhm )) 

134.13 135.15 A: mhm 

134.40 136.61 B: and nowadays 

136.81 139.81 B: these kids can't even 

139.95 141.69 B: spell correctly 

142.99 144.79 A: oh yeah it's 

145.96 148.52 A: when i was i went back to college 

148.58 151.05 A: fairly late in my life to get a 

151.53 156.06 A: an advanced degree and i ended up as a teacher's assistant 

155.64 156.70 B: mhm 

156.13 167.22 A: and this was in grad school and college graduates could not write english sentences which is pathetic you know it's bad enough that grade schools can't do it 

166.92 167.92 B: uh-huh 

167.06 172.10 A: but they have been getting through the system all the way up to graduate level 

172.11 173.96 A: it is pathetic 

174.67 186.86 B: well what do you suppose is the problem here are we are we trying to concentrate too much on um you know the sports and stuff like that 

186.50 189.61 A: well i think that it's probably 

189.74 200.81 A: just the opposite the kids in school today the grade school kids are taking so much more material than what we took it's mind boggling 

200.94 201.90 A: (( i mean )) 

202.06 216.98 A: the the world they're looking at is so different than the world that we looked you know at the maps and history and stuff like that just consider history consider what has changed in the last well fifty five years 

209.19 210.28 B: mhm 

216.69 217.77 B: oh yeah 

217.01 218.36 A: fifty years 

218.52 219.64 A: uh 

219.70 229.54 A: consider the amount of history those kids have got to uh somehow absorb and that's recent history that's not even picking up the the old stuff uh 

226.42 227.59 B: (( mhm )) 

229.16 230.55 B: right 

229.58 236.00 A: they've changed all kinds of things about the dinosaurs and you know even the basic stuff that we thought we knew 

236.43 245.17 A: they've been updating and changing so the amount of material that they're loading in kids today is mind boggling 

245.21 247.34 A: so you know it 

247.37 259.30 A: in a way they don't have the time to to deal with it and in some cases i think they don't have the people that uh or they 

260.83 266.12 A: they have so much material they're trying to provide that they don't spend the time on the basics 

266.40 269.02 A: such as reading and writing 

269.35 275.23 B: uh do you suppose that um computers could be one of the causes 

276.28 277.64 A: uh 

278.78 279.94 A: no 

279.99 284.36 A: because i think the kids or the public school systems were uh 

284.51 288.65 A: degrading long before computers became 

288.67 294.44 A: uh common computers are only really common in the last fifteen years or so 

293.86 295.76 B: mhm mhm 

295.01 299.05 A: uh you know fifteen years ago nobody dreamed that 

299.10 299.99 A: uh 

300.46 307.24 A: three quarters of the population would have a computer at home and we would be talking to each other 

307.31 309.75 A: uh by a computer 

310.21 311.05 A: it's 

311.06 315.26 A: you know there were computers but that's what big companies had or whatever 

315.44 316.72 B: well you know i 

315.65 319.65 A: and i think the school system was falling apart before that 

319.08 322.06 B: yeah i i've noticed a a lot of 

322.19 323.99 B: a lot of kids 

324.56 328.41 B: or or let's call it teenagers anyway 

328.52 329.50 A: mhm 

328.52 329.69 B: um 

329.91 337.43 B: you know they're so used to using the computers they got spell check and so they don't 

337.82 345.44 B: actually care how they're spelling because they'll go through and do a spell check and um 

343.89 344.96 A: mhm 

345.71 349.08 B: and as as far as math 

349.23 352.57 B: you know it seems like everybody's got a little calculator 

352.63 360.28 B: and i've i've talked with people that you know they cannot figure out a simple 

352.88 353.90 A: mhm 

360.37 363.20 B: addition subtraction kind of thing 

363.32 366.12 B: with without grabbing hold of a calculator 

365.92 367.66 A: mhm 

367.89 368.86 B: so 

368.07 372.31 A: yeah i you know but i think that's more laziness than lack of uh 

372.45 373.77 A: education in 

373.98 374.96 B: uh-huh 

373.98 383.42 A: fact i think if you if you probe back you'll probably find they knew how to do it it's just they didn't bother remembering or keeping up with it 

383.36 387.70 B: okay all right well what do you think then is 

385.12 388.75 A: so you know i think it it just got so easy that we 

389.26 391.11 A: forget it 

391.09 394.54 B: you you think that they're just getting too much information 

394.98 401.82 A: i think that's one of the primary things and i think that the teachers have no haven't been able to keep up with 

402.22 403.18 B: (( now uh-huh )) 

402.49 409.16 A: it and i think with too much information they're not spending the time on the fundamentals 

410.12 412.39 A: you know if you think about it 

412.42 413.69 A: when they uh 

414.21 424.91 A: start talking about cutting budgets to schools they start cutting out these non essential things like athletics when you've got the kids uh 

417.77 418.68 B: (( mhm )) 

425.37 439.19 A: are developing their mental and physical abilities which reflect back on their ability to study they cut out the arts and things like that which is probably one of the few fields where they 

429.98 431.11 B: mhm 

439.09 441.61 A: get to deal with paradoxes 

441.80 446.51 A: you know they don't the rote stuff into their brain 

447.70 452.29 A: that's the other thing is i think the text books may be done down 

452.50 453.88 A: so that uh 

454.37 469.00 A: they just their response is to go through the book and pick out the answer you know when they ask them questions as opposed to asking them questions that require them to think of an answer based on the information they have you know what i mean 

461.05 462.18 B: mhm 

469.14 473.13 B: so have have you seen that when you were doing 

473.16 475.34 B: uh um your 

475.56 479.27 B: stint in college getting that degree 

477.98 478.78 A: yeah 

479.29 481.78 A: mhm plus you know 

482.03 491.01 A: my daughter i went to help her with her studies and such and i can say that the questions or the study the test they give them 

491.09 498.42 A: essentially just ask them to identify information that's readily identifiable in the text book 

498.52 500.04 A: as opposed to 

498.86 499.74 B: uh-huh 

500.12 509.15 A: uh having to figure something out based on the information that's available in the text book you know the next level of thinking all they got to do is remember 

505.22 506.32 B: mhm 

510.41 514.66 A: and then they turn around and forget a few years later 

514.04 516.40 B: so they're concentrating then 

516.61 530.24 B: kinda what i hear you saying um too much on maybe all of these dates of things happening when they they should take the um major things 

530.26 533.48 B: you know like uh for instance our 

533.51 534.97 B: our uh 

535.18 537.21 B: war of independence 

537.27 538.31 A: mhm 

537.43 546.17 B: and make sure that the the kids know what it was about when it happened and and forget 

546.06 560.88 B: you know like this indian war happened in such a such a date and that uh that little war happened in such and such a date and you that is is that basically kinda what you're saying is 

551.04 552.16 A: mhm 

560.37 564.96 A: i yeah i think that's one of the major elements involved 

563.58 567.35 B: yeah i i can agree with that you know i 

567.76 573.35 B: [laughter] i've seen people asked uh you know what 

574.83 577.76 B: uh when was the first world war 

577.85 581.31 B: oh nineteen forty five you know 

580.65 583.38 A: yeah or was there more than one 

581.40 582.33 B: and 

583.69 596.39 B: was there more than one [laughter] yeah yeah so and and i you know there there are certain things that that need to be uh retained that are important 

596.49 598.16 A: mhm 

598.14 599.65 B: um 

598.79 599.95 A: especially the
