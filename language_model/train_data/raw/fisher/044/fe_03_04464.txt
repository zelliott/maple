3.95 6.13 B: oh hi stewart i'm in l. a. 

6.04 7.59 A: you're in l. a. cool 

7.03 8.47 B: (( yeah how ya doing )) 

8.24 11.42 A: i'm fine fine am i on speakerphone 

9.96 11.05 B: yeah 

11.58 13.44 B: yeah 

12.39 13.35 A: okay 

14.14 15.61 B: yeah i am um 

14.16 15.11 A: um 

15.70 21.53 B: i was basically i mean it's interesting uh regarding the topic on how they can be improved the public schools and um 

21.89 33.59 B: actually i feel they at least down here in l. a. that i feel they could be they could do a lot of improvements out here just because of what's going on and a lot of the way the you know 

33.85 40.12 B: people bringing you know weapons and things to school and what i mean columbine obviously is a perfect example 

39.93 40.89 A: mhm 

40.18 43.67 B: um you know as far as safety for for 

43.77 50.99 B: the students as well as you know many other things in academic areas and um what's how do you feel about what's your opinion 

50.82 65.80 A: well i i i think that they could definitely be spending a lot more money i mean i don't know what the um budget is in l. a. but in san francisco you know there's not eight hundred thousand people there's a there's a budget of eight point four billion dollars 

61.28 62.19 B: right 

65.46 66.84 B: is there really 

66.49 81.06 A: that's what that's what the budget is and and they can't even make that they're already like in the red but just the fact that a budget with with that much money they should be spending i would you know i i would like a a billion of it just on education 

80.77 82.29 B: yeah absolutely 

81.91 83.45 A: you you know what i mean 

82.84 85.33 B: absolutely and i yeah 

83.78 87.60 A: but you know there's there's just so much graft and waste here 

88.03 89.05 B: yeah 

88.07 94.61 A: that it it's ridiculous and i'm sure i don't know what it is in l. a. but i'm sure they've got a really big budget too but there's a lot more people there huh 

94.49 100.26 B: yeah actually yeah believe it or not but you know i actually most of my family a lot of my um 

100.35 111.75 B: like my uncle and uh cousins live up in san francisco which they have all their life and the fact is they even refer to l. a. as so much money's being spent on other different you know many different things that are not as priority 

111.64 112.52 A: right 

111.68 118.54 B: um you know but then again you know like we we have the california lottery which i know with a lot of the a lot of the um 

118.52 130.13 B: the money that is you know a certain amount a percentage of money that's taken from there is donated to a lot of the schools and the improvements in the schools and so on that's a good idea but i mean um 

128.41 130.17 A: yeah 

130.16 132.29 B: but i think there's a lot like 

132.26 146.54 B: i can just think back probably a few years ago where i was talking to my niece and she's now in the university of michigan but when she was out here in going to school here in l. a. that she was still complaining of the fact that there was still not air conditioning in some of the in uh some of the classes that she was attending 

146.59 148.54 A: wow wow 

147.25 149.86 B: (( and um and this and this was in high school )) 

149.76 151.37 A: yeah that's bad 

150.73 163.39 B: that's real bad and i mean the majority of 'em have that but you know some of 'em didn't and when i heard this i was just like stunned because i know in various parts of the country you know i'm sure they have their 

152.03 153.00 A: yeah 

163.38 165.83 B: their financial um 

165.86 179.02 B: reasons as well which they all tend to differ but i still think the bottom line is yes i do think that there's a lot you know going on with the school systems and i think of it has to come down with you know down to budget and what and how and how its utilized 

176.51 178.29 A: yeah 

178.98 191.53 A: yeah i think it's a waste i i mean it's it's really bad up here as far as like the every district all around the bay area is having to cut teachers and the teachers are protesting 'cause 

179.52 180.91 B: and um 

192.07 197.39 A: how how how is a child going to get an education and and it doesn't matter whether or not you have children 

196.94 198.42 B: exactly it's a limit- 

197.77 199.46 A: you know everyone wants 

199.63 205.20 A: for the kids to do good in school and and to like have what they need in order to do good 

204.06 207.06 B: exactly and um like my brother's a teacher 

207.21 209.72 B: um and he teaches you know down in uh 

209.73 210.90 B: san diego 

210.61 211.67 A: mhm 

211.09 223.26 B: and for what he has to go through is like i mean he was a substitute teacher for three years and then he finally became a permanent teacher but you know there were times where he actually had to lose his class and the students were second and third graders and they were 

223.30 231.49 B: so upset because they really wanted my brother as a teacher you know because you know kids get you know used kids get you know adapt to the teacher 

228.45 230.32 A: yeah 

231.13 232.89 A: exactly 

231.51 242.29 B: and yeah and he ended up you know they had to transfer him to another class and then to another school because they didn't have enough kids in order to provide him in order you know for you know to teach them so 

241.89 243.63 A: right 

242.35 246.13 B: it's you know it's also the red tape politics involved with it too 

245.98 248.49 A: yeah yeah 

246.48 260.64 B: you know and yeah and and it was really sad because you know they had a whole reunion for my brother they had like this whole thing and it was so adorable because they they all bought my m- they all threw my brother like a going away party and they bought him all kinda presents it was just so adorable 

260.67 272.39 B: and and my brother was like so like emotionally touched by that he was like well you know i don't want you to buy me gifts i just wanna have my students and so i mean it i think it i think it goes in a lotta different ways 

260.70 261.70 A: wow 

272.55 274.24 B: other than i mean in 

273.39 286.21 A: it's bad it's bad all the way around i think i think they should designate like a a percentage of the budget to be spent on education irregardless like twenty or thirty percent automatically just oughta go to education and not whatever 

281.85 283.19 B: absolutely 

286.05 291.00 A: it is i mean maybe the maybe the percentage is bigger i i doubt it but 

289.36 300.53 B: yeah e- exactly i gotta two and i don't know what the percentage here is in l. a. but i do know whatever it is it isn't enough just as i'm sure it isn't enough in san francisco up there 

299.87 301.46 A: mhm no 

300.49 301.62 B: and um 

301.43 303.75 B: and i have a friend that lives over in and she was 

303.73 317.94 B: telling me the same thing that even though she's you know she's like forty five minutes from nappa but she says she's going to school and she's running into the same problem up there as far as different budget cuts and different things that she's had to you know forfeit because of the financial situation 

318.07 320.95 B: and the finan- and the financial aid that's another problem 

318.19 319.99 A: yeah 

321.33 324.01 A: yeah that is a big problem 

322.90 325.05 B: you know and there's a lot of you know 

324.93 338.65 B: with with students that have to pay all this money out of pocket on financial aid and then sit there and pay off their student loans for twenty years i mean you know i understand that it does help and you've gotta do what you've gotta do to get you through school and what you need to do but 

332.20 333.97 A: yeah 

338.47 345.60 B: on the on the same token you're paying off a loan twenty or thirty years later and by the time it's paid off it's probably tripled in interest by then 

345.50 347.23 A: yeah 

345.89 360.13 B: so so you know there's so many different aspects but as far as the school system itself i mean yes i do feel that it's come a long way in the last probably twenty something years 'cause i you know i'm thirty six but um but i know that there's much room for improvement 

360.14 362.88 A: uh-huh yeah i definitely think so 

360.65 361.53 B: yeah 

362.86 371.42 B: yeah but i you know it was interesting because i just found about the survey that they were doing 'cause a friend had told me about it and so this is the second call that i've done i did you know i did one yesterday 

371.50 373.17 A: yeah this is my third 

371.81 372.58 B: (( and uh )) 

372.87 374.83 B: oh this is your third oh wow 

374.60 378.80 A: yeah so i guess i i wanna go look online i think it's the last one i do 

378.16 382.36 B: so yeah you do three yeah yeah you do three and um 

379.88 381.88 A: yeah 

382.05 383.60 A: they'll call you every day 

383.60 385.84 B: (( yeah did you do three in a row and like )) 

385.21 386.26 A: no 

386.13 387.80 B: oh you didn't oh 

386.96 394.02 A: no i i think i didn't do the last two days just 'cause when they called it was just like not the right time for me to really wanna talk on the phone 

393.48 394.84 B: yeah exactly 

394.62 397.11 A: you know i mean i've got 

395.32 400.62 B: yeah and for me it's just you know it works out well and i was like i'm like it's very interesting that the university is doing this 

400.65 402.59 A: yeah 

401.16 413.87 B: and i think it's really important because they can reach out to you know improvement and and it really sounds like it would be going up pretty far in the ladder to probably try to better improve the school system all together i mean i would certainly whatever it takes 

413.79 418.80 B: but it's it's nice to know that it's actually coming from a university where you know the 

413.83 415.49 A: yeah 

417.86 421.42 A: i suppose they have enough funding there [laughter] 

420.16 424.60 B: yeah yeah exactly and my father went to penn state [laughter] 

423.95 425.39 A: oh that's cool

433.81 435.57 A: yeah 

434.77 447.60 B: and um uh obviously the lakers too but uh you know but it's it's really been um interesting that they have a topic of this and and i'm glad if they i mean i they said that this has been around for a long time i wasn't aware of that 

447.23 449.46 A: no me either me either 

448.23 451.34 B: yeah and um did you hear about it through a friend or 

451.14 456.92 A: no on the internet on yeah look yeah look on craig's list

456.51 457.81 B: mhm 

457.15 460.12 A: under the et cetera part for jobs offered 

459.61 460.53 B: right

462.95 464.50 B: oh really 

463.75 466.40 A: yeah all the different things that that are offered 

466.48 467.74 B: oh wow 

467.53 470.75 A: yeah that's that's how i found out about it 

469.68 473.45 B: oh and and the web it's like w. w. w. dot like university of penn state 

472.49 475.27 A: craig's list yeah they've got one in l. a. too 

473.79 474.47 B: (( oh o- )) 

474.93 476.46 B: oh really 

475.88 479.82 A: yeah they've got them all over they've got they've got 'em from all over the world now i guess 

479.32 481.53 B: oh all the universities are doing it 

481.71 483.13 A: yeah 

482.52 484.94 B: oh i hadn't never even heard of that wow 

485.06 487.98 B: well that's good to know and i just i think that overall 

488.15 496.21 B: that's pretty much my my my insight of um of what i feel about it but as far as money wise i think you know 

496.55 504.80 B: once they would have this financial it could the first in so many different ways and of course the number one way of course would be number one safety evolving 

504.84 505.72 B: uh 

505.00 507.19 A: yeah yeah 

505.92 511.69 B: but sorry there's a plane going by [laughter] but um but by the same token you know 

512.03 515.86 B: i mean at least down here in l. a. with what's going on it's just you know the 

515.83 529.95 B: the gated areas i mean i live personally in a good area out here in san fernando valley but the fact is in any area you know it's amazing what you're hearing on the news is about the the safety of kids and and you know as far as having the 

529.72 541.34 B: the schools where they're they're better well dated where you don't have people walking down the street and you don't know who these people are that are watching out for their kids you know so you wanna less abductions on on on t. v. type of thing 

541.09 544.14 A: yeah yeah it was never like that when i went to school 

542.93 553.59 B: so yeah me either i mean you never you never had to worry about you know say your you know your child goes to school and he walks home and he's fine and you know you you never hear of these found on a milk carton type of thing 

550.18 551.36 A: yeah 

553.35 554.44 A: yeah 

553.81 558.79 B: um and i'm just so glad that now with the amber alert and everything that's now nat- you know national 

558.70 571.34 B: you know that'll help that problem but as far as you know relating to schools and and things like that i think that's where a lot of the money i shouldn't i wouldn't say all the money but i'd say a good portion of the money should you know be devoted to that area 

558.98 560.68 A: yeah 

571.35 572.62 A: yeah 

571.90 577.18 B: and then in addition to of course the educational part of it um you know that 

575.98 577.96 A: i think it should be free 

577.55 578.87 B: pardon me 

578.19 582.56 A: i said i i think that it should be free if you want to go un- university it should be free 

581.99 585.37 B: yeah exactly i mean the the tuitions are just enormous 

585.23 587.23 A: yeah 

585.77 591.66 B: i mean it's just u. c. l. a. out here i mean it's and you know u. s. e. it is just astronomical 

591.60 593.19 A: yeah i'm sure 

592.09 596.50 B: and um yeah i don't know how they expect you know people 

596.54 599.85 B: you know seventeen eighteen years old being able to afford you know
