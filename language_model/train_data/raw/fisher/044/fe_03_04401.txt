7.85 8.79 B: kind of a tough 

8.12 9.55 A: you want to go first 

9.13 10.95 B: kind of a tough topic 

10.97 14.29 A: yes i didn't catch this uh the first time through um 

14.48 17.03 A: because uh i didn't answer the phone and 

14.94 15.29 B: well 

16.97 19.56 B: at first when the computer said 

17.29 17.76 A: (( not good )) 

20.10 20.66 B: um 

21.97 25.48 B: your only stipulation was i started my mind started going well 

25.63 26.76 B: what wouldn't i do 

26.94 27.40 A: (( right )) 

27.32 30.75 B: but then they said never speak to your best friend (( i was all )) oh my god 

31.74 32.34 A: (( )) 

32.15 34.59 B: and you know you're supposed to say i could never do that 

34.64 35.77 A: (( laugh )) 

35.49 37.80 B: but a million dollars is a million dollars 

37.66 40.83 A: i know that's really it is a really hard one 

41.41 41.88 A: um 

42.05 43.10 B: you could always 

44.62 50.52 B: well i don't know if that would be a substitute but i was going to say you could do things for that person 

51.11 51.65 A: mhm 

52.13 53.78 B: but it wouldn't really be the same 

53.69 54.79 A: right it wouldn't be the same 

55.28 56.19 A: (( not speaking to them )) 

58.25 58.94 B: yeah 

58.25 63.34 A: yeah i had i had a similar question the other day that i was offered a million dollars to leave the united states 

63.94 66.88 A: and that one was easy for me (( )) (( laugh )) 

67.05 68.15 B: did you say you would go 

68.36 68.72 A: no 

69.11 69.43 B: oh 

69.58 70.00 A: no 

70.91 77.67 A: i i can't see any other country that i would really want to go to and it's like my husband said later a million dollars isn't really that much 

78.69 80.12 A: relocate and all that but 

78.90 79.59 B: that's true 

80.26 81.75 A: i don't this yeah this one 

82.83 83.87 B: like (( )) 

83.17 85.05 A: i think i (( )) 

84.38 86.56 B: well because i you know when you think about it 

88.74 92.03 B: it should be that your breast your best friend is your spouse 

92.28 92.67 A: right 

92.91 93.23 A: right 

94.13 94.59 B: and 

94.93 95.85 A: then you can't you know 

95.01 95.46 B: (( )) 

96.13 97.11 B: who could do that 

96.21 97.09 A: course can't do that 

97.21 97.59 A: right 

98.01 98.33 A: right 

98.92 100.19 A: that's what i was thinking too 

101.41 102.85 B: what was that movie where 

103.39 106.53 B: the woman got offered a million dollars to sleep with some guy 

107.22 107.66 B: and her uh 

107.24 108.24 A: i didn't see that 

108.58 109.37 A: or hear about that 

109.19 109.66 B: oh 

111.08 112.68 B: but her husband said go ahead and do it 

114.42 118.48 A: hm and then i assume there were problems afterwards 

118.28 120.25 B: um i think she decided not to do it 

120.10 120.75 A: oh (( )) 

121.81 123.92 B: [breath] i would have to say 

126.35 127.44 B: i wouldn't 

128.81 129.56 B: take the money 

130.39 134.24 B: and i would hope that i'd get rewarded in other ways down the road 

134.87 137.38 A: i think that seems like a very good answer 

137.58 141.26 A: now what do you talk about eight minutes 

141.37 143.18 A: yeah i think that um 

143.93 145.43 B: on the other hand 

147.22 150.01 B: in the interests of keeping the conversation going 

151.32 154.44 B: you could do a lot of good with that money that would 

155.66 156.80 B: help your friend 

156.96 157.98 A: mhm mhm 

158.35 159.44 B: but again i keep 

159.56 160.10 B: [noise] 

160.35 161.69 B: if i think about you know my 

162.04 163.56 B: my closest girlfriend 

164.21 167.76 B: doesn't even live in town here with me it's not like we see each other 

166.02 166.46 A: right 

167.71 169.09 A: and they may not know that 

169.35 169.86 A: you 

170.27 175.13 A: are doing this for them i mean if you're not speaking to them they won't speak to you and 

175.12 175.68 B: yeah 

175.25 175.57 A: (( yup )) 

175.96 179.16 A: i don't know if in a roundabout way they'd find out who is their benefactor but 

179.98 180.99 B: i suppose 

182.28 185.57 B: uh it's a technicality but i suppose you couldn't write to them either 

187.30 189.29 A: (( )) 

190.11 190.57 A: yeah 

191.14 193.17 A: i'm not allowed to speak to you 

191.18 191.89 B: but if it's 

193.30 195.94 B: if it's really your best friend 

196.62 197.49 A: i think that (( )) 

196.70 198.58 B: and you really needed the money 

199.97 201.06 B: it'd be like 

201.27 202.39 B: okay here's the deal 

202.91 205.87 B: i had to take the million dollars because i need a new kidney 

206.60 208.10 B: and you and i will split it 

208.82 210.35 B: but we can only write letters 

212.29 215.44 A: yeah i yeah that is kind of good doesn't it 

215.25 218.78 B: but if it was my spouse 

218.87 219.90 A: yeah there's no way 

220.35 221.22 B: uh-uh 

222.99 224.69 B: that's a just a mean question 

224.83 226.42 A: yeah that's uh 

226.52 228.31 A: that is a really hard one 

230.56 233.81 B: you know if you were a really awful person with a lot of money 

234.29 235.21 B: you could walk around 

235.42 236.62 B: doing that to people 

236.78 237.19 A: mhm 

237.32 239.92 B: it's like will you sell your soul to the devil sort of thing 

239.34 239.83 A: right 

240.16 240.57 A: right 

241.96 244.97 A: i don't know uh yeah and if your friend if 

245.47 249.43 A: if it wasn't something they needed the kidney or an operation if they found out that 

249.85 252.30 A: you aren't speaking to them because they took a million dollars it 

252.69 253.98 A: i would be pretty angry uh 

254.12 256.43 A: a a friend if somebody did that to me you know 

256.83 260.59 A: they were bought out for a million dollars now they aren't going to be my friend 

257.82 259.07 B: i don't know i 

259.17 259.85 B: i think 

260.18 260.93 B: i think i could 

262.08 264.31 B: you know just knowing the situation 

264.32 266.24 A: yeah as long as they shared it 

264.47 266.76 B: and hearing it i would know that 

267.83 273.43 B: she really thought long and hard about it and for whatever her reasons decided that's what she had to do 

269.98 270.38 A: right 

276.24 279.79 B: and then i would hope that she would do something for me 

279.31 279.84 A: right 

280.94 281.32 A: right 

281.48 284.27 B: [breath] you know we could really split that money 

284.37 285.07 A: mhm 

286.63 287.05 B: and 

286.64 287.00 A: yeah i 

287.48 290.15 B: another technicality what if i could talk to 

290.33 292.55 B: her mother or her spouse 

292.29 293.15 A: her spouse right 

293.17 294.33 B: or her sister 

294.25 294.77 A: right 

294.90 297.13 B: there are ways of carrying on a relationship 

297.17 297.65 A: mhm 

300.04 306.99 A: yeah or or going to the same activities and at least waiting or something or writing you're not speaking by writing a note 

302.80 304.16 B: maybe yeah 

305.55 307.47 B: you could learn sign language 

307.21 309.64 A: yeah or write a note 

309.87 310.40 A: yeah 

311.51 313.87 A: see each other at soccer games and whatever and 

314.20 319.41 B: somehow i think that's not the point they should have worded it as have no communication with 

319.51 320.76 A: right right yeah 

321.45 322.22 B: and then 

323.54 324.85 B: i think that would just be 

325.76 326.69 B: i couldn't do that 

328.27 330.25 B: because like you said your husband said 

330.77 332.91 B: it's really not that much money anymore 

333.07 333.99 A: no no 

334.13 335.81 B: it's certainly more than i have 

337.60 339.58 A: it sounds really good but yeah 

339.60 341.70 B: but when you think about it it's not like 

342.56 346.09 B: you know when i was a kid oh a million dollars would buy you the world 

346.07 346.51 A: right 

346.99 349.18 A: first of all the government would take at least half of it 

349.21 351.05 B: right that's what i was just going to say 

352.45 354.30 B: you only get half of it and then 

355.77 358.55 B: everybody's got their hand out for the other half 

357.49 357.99 A: right 

363.08 363.51 B: and then 

363.75 365.92 B: think of how indebted your friend would be 

366.44 370.86 B: i could have had a million dollars but i chose to stay your friend 

366.48 367.14 A: mhm 

371.36 373.65 B: so you better always be nice to me 

373.59 376.63 A: you think that would work 

376.64 377.11 B: no 

377.26 378.75 A: they probably wouldn't even believe that 

378.84 380.93 B: i'd get told off so fast 

380.47 384.98 A: you know they'd probably think you're joking or something they wouldn't even believe that you'd turn down a million dollars 

385.32 387.91 B: maybe i'll try that tonight i'll call her and say 

386.73 387.10 A: yeah 

389.05 392.96 B: say somebody offered me a million dollars to never speak to you again and i turned it down 

391.75 392.25 A: mhm 

393.02 393.53 A: right 

393.77 394.39 B: she'd say 

394.49 395.80 B: you idiot 

395.42 397.63 A: yeah that's probably 

397.87 399.26 A: that's true 

399.40 400.91 A: that's probably what would happen 

401.17 401.94 A: oh wow 

402.16 402.42 A: hm 

403.66 405.21 A: so what other angles 

405.81 406.35 B: well 

407.21 407.84 A: i think 

408.38 410.36 A: we've got three more (( )) 

409.93 412.28 B: writing letter 

412.95 415.44 B: communicating with other people 

416.65 418.80 B: or what if you could just like 

420.18 423.62 B: subli- well not subliminally but secretly 

424.23 425.47 B: kind of communicate but 

425.64 427.43 B: she would kind of have to figure out 

428.30 429.22 B: who it was 

429.35 429.87 A: mhm 

430.56 433.55 B: like doing these things for or like you know 

433.21 434.38 A: well your husband could t- 

434.64 436.73 A: you know speak to her husband or something 

436.65 437.29 B: yeah 

438.41 440.20 B: or like if she goes to 

440.76 442.02 B: a football game you could 

442.54 444.56 B: send a message over the uh 

444.68 446.36 B: scoreboard how do they do that 

447.75 449.99 A: yeah you wouldn't be wouldn't be talking to her 

449.14 452.63 B: hi carol 

453.01 454.95 A: oh wow 

455.31 457.86 A: yeah you've got great ideas 

456.86 462.30 B: oh i'm a schemer there's got to be a way around it 

461.16 461.99 A: uh huh 

463.71 467.27 B: but that is tough like i said she doesn't she lives in vermont 

464.34 464.68 A: yeah 

467.32 467.86 A: mhm 

467.97 469.87 B: so i don't get to see her very often 

470.47 471.39 B: but we do speak 

471.52 472.28 B: frequently 

472.70 476.13 A: well you're good thinking on your feet the first phone call i got i panicked and i 

476.39 478.07 A: i hung up because um 

478.26 484.94 A: i felt i didn't understand the question and i felt like i was in speech class and i had to give an impromptu speech and i'm the quiet shy kind and that 

485.06 486.41 A: just awful 

486.43 488.26 B: well i think you're doing just fine 

488.31 490.59 A: thank you you're doing great so that's helped 

496.60 498.57 A: real phone call too this is my second 

498.87 500.35 A: and the first one wa- um 

500.95 502.70 A: didn't have any problem speaking you know 

502.85 503.72 A: just like you (( i was )) 

504.20 504.76 A: able to 

505.04 506.24 A: carry on so i could [noise] 

505.83 511.28 B: i was i was uh my first one i was really curious about what are they listening for 

511.25 511.74 A: mhm 

511.72 512.19 B: [breath] 

511.90 512.48 A: mhm 

512.30 513.09 B: and i think they're 

513.21 514.61 B: testing phone equipment 

516.38 517.18 A: well 

517.31 520.52 A: i think it was the university of pennsylvania education uh
