31.84 33.71 A: you're from california huh 

32.95 41.30 B: yeah yeah so what do you think about the public s- what's the question is there a problem in our public schools 

40.95 42.97 A: yeah 

43.11 44.57 A: well 

45.90 52.33 A: ah i'm i'm right now i'm i'm like in my what senior year in college 

51.71 53.07 B: yeah 

53.01 60.18 A: so i i just recently got out of public school and i i don't know just where i grew up it was it was okay 

60.30 70.15 A: i don't know how it is anywhere else i don't think there's a real big problem maybe it's in in bigger cities there might be a problem with funding and stuff 

62.33 63.43 B: uh-huh 

70.97 75.50 B: so you're you're fairly ah you're kind of young then right if you're just 

74.66 76.10 A: yeah 

75.68 78.25 B: what are you twenty one twenty two years old 

77.62 79.39 A: yeah like twenty two 

79.19 92.93 B: yeah and i think what ah i think what happens when people are older like i'm fifty nine so i probably have a a broader range to look at as far as time goes 

92.78 93.66 A: (( mhm )) 

93.24 102.46 B: and what i what i see in schools today compared to how i think it was when i was going to public schools and what people earn now compared to then 

102.63 105.19 B: you know it it seems to me like ah 

105.79 120.25 B: i don't know what they're i think there's a problem because the classes are like way bigger they're twice as big as they used to be and students can't ah get as much individual attention as they used to be i don't think the quality of the teachers is quite as good as it ah 

116.76 117.79 A: yeah 

120.25 123.87 B: used to be people people nowadays ah 

124.41 129.50 B: you know nobody wants to be a teacher you just just kind of like a leftover thing you know what i mean 

129.31 130.52 A: yeah 

129.91 133.63 B: and so that's kind of sad um [sigh] 

134.64 141.75 B: i don't know i i just think schools are better they they used to be better than what they are ah what they are now 

142.38 156.12 A: yeah as far as the the subject matter at schools i don't know i think it may be a little better than it was when my parents were growing up ah i think the their subject matter was kind of limited i don't know why 

156.50 161.41 A: but um nowadays kids are introduced to a lot of stuff now 

161.83 165.94 A: i have the my point of view is i don't think school is for everyone 

166.00 168.98 A: you know some kids may not 

169.93 177.08 A: may not flourish in that type of environment some children may i think our children need some kind of training but 

176.49 177.45 B: uh-huh 

177.20 184.72 A: education on the level that most kids get it today i don't think it's i don't think it's um necessary 

184.83 186.13 A: because 

187.41 188.46 A: (( ah )) 

188.67 189.92 A: basic 

190.25 196.91 A: things maybe like basic mathematics and addition of course yes students need those but 

196.99 203.34 A: as far as when you go into upper level stuff most of the stuff that kids learn in high school 

203.28 204.38 B: yeah 

203.60 209.21 A: i think they it's it's up to them they should have a choice just to move on and start on 

209.65 221.32 A: something that they could actually you know that can benefit them because a lot of kids they don't even care a lot of kids when they graduate from high school they just go straight into the workforce and they work at mcdonalds or 

221.43 224.38 A: work at a wal mart or something like that and they don't 

224.96 236.70 A: that's all that they do you know they're they never think about anything else and st- a lot of this training that they got from fourteen to seventeen is eighteen they is 

236.81 239.57 A: it's really no use to them 

239.84 240.76 B: huh 

241.32 246.43 B: well what happens if they want to if they change their mind about what they might want later on 

246.36 249.47 A: well then they have adult education programs 

249.78 254.66 A: you know but it's no it's i mean now nowadays kids are so 

254.81 265.96 A: ah they're they're forced to grow up so fast by watching television and stuff the television feeds to them and the the the environment that you grow up in now the kids are 

261.01 262.01 B: uh-huh 

265.73 277.48 A: they should be they should be allowed to make their own choices earlier you know earlier than just eighteen maybe they should be able to start making their own choices at fourteen because a child can't be tried as an adult 

277.58 284.48 A: and i've seen about around in their teenage they are they're most definitely tried as adults so 

284.52 290.65 A: i think that is th- i- they should have they should have more control over their own destiny earlier 

290.98 294.61 B: do you think kids of fourteen are really mature enough 

293.55 306.43 A: i mean i i don't i'm not going to sa- because i know a lot of children that are twenty five and twenty seven that still live in with their parents you know i don't i'm not saying that you should just put them out in the world but i think that they should 

306.71 308.37 A: take another path 

308.64 311.72 A: other than just ah [mn] 

311.90 316.96 A: just the way the ah the form- the education that students are receiving nowadays 

317.49 319.56 B: so you think there's a problem then 

320.07 333.64 A: uh well yeah a- on that level it is a problem because ah kids are lot more advanced today i mean just now when i look at my nephew he's around eight he's almost eight years old and he's 

333.49 339.65 A: i mean the way he thinks i i i i couldn't even conceive thinking like that when i was eight 

339.62 349.51 A: maybe it took i don- i i i didn't even think about the type of things that he thought about maybe until i was maybe in the sixth or seventh grade you know so 

339.82 340.81 B: uh-huh 

350.58 356.49 A: i just think that it's something that that ah lawmakers need to really think about 

357.66 358.48 B: huh 

359.45 363.21 B: [sigh] well i i guess um 

363.43 368.93 B: my feeling about it is a little different than that i i i don't think that 

366.67 367.80 A: yeah 

368.83 379.24 B: ah i don't think that the kids get enough education i don't think the quality is good as it used to be and and i think we ought to do more to keep them in school i sure don't think kids are 

379.16 385.73 B: ah in their early teens are capable of making decisions that are going to impact them for their rest of their life especially 

385.68 396.35 B: and you can say that they adult education is available and in some places it's more available than others i'm sure of that but by the time a person gets to be an adult then maybe they have a 

396.19 403.18 B: a family and they're having to work two jobs in order to try and support the family because they didn't get the right education in the first place 

403.40 413.31 B: and they don't ha- and then they're not able to go back to school and say you know i think i'd like to go to junior college and pick up a couple of classes because they can't even get in to junior college without 

413.38 421.67 B: ah without that education that's in you know their their elementary type of edu- l- years of education so 

421.77 424.07 B: it's a hard spot for them to be 

425.25 426.57 B: that's for sure 

426.54 428.01 A: yeah 

428.15 433.19 A: well yeah you you you you you do make a point 

433.54 435.07 A: (( but [mn] )) 

436.23 440.70 A: that's what ah i think that 

441.07 448.60 A: i think that i i don't i don't want to just sound pessimistic but just the way things look you know children 

448.68 450.94 A: (( who are who are fourteen )) 

451.02 463.28 A: fifteen who are really going on a path where there's they're losing interest in school you know i mean i'm s- as an a as an example children who are losing interest in school at around fourteen to fifteen 

463.94 465.01 A: i mean 

465.58 470.41 A: they're going to be working at mcdonalds be working two or three jobs anyway 

471.62 476.99 A: they i mean maybe later on when they think about it you know th- they may 

477.22 480.15 A: want to further their education but 

480.97 495.47 A: as far as that they could be doing something productive other than just wasting their time in school and just get a high school diploma that is not going to really mean anything to them nowadays you know a high school diploma doesn't really get you too many places unless you have 

495.58 497.98 A: that hook up you know 

498.08 499.10 B: uh-huh 

500.29 501.35 A: so 

502.00 503.82 A: just 

504.32 512.17 A: just looking at it like that it's just kind of it's it just has to be it kind of gives me a different perspective when i think about how kids 

513.08 514.02 A: don't 

514.13 519.97 A: they're getting ti- i mean i have friends that actually are teachers and um 

520.94 525.79 A: they they c- they kind of complain to me about how the students 

525.83 533.31 A: and you know in secondary school and like high school and middle school how they're 

533.70 543.55 A: really th- they're acting out i mean and there's something else that i mean there's something else that they could be doing other than that because if they're not liking school then what are they going to like you know 

543.92 545.94 A: as far as the education 

546.41 551.44 A: so i don't think there's anything that could be done that'll sort of make those kids 

551.60 554.37 A: want to learn any more than they do you know 

554.52 556.43 B: yeah 

558.00 559.05 B: (( [sigh] i don't know )) 

559.33 569.09 A: i think it's all about s- a a self motivation you can't really force a child to force anyone nowadays to do something that they don't want to 

569.39 572.70 A: you know and i think it's just like 

573.22 578.91 A: that those that time once they figure out that they like they're getting sick and tired of school hey 

579.31 581.05 A: do something else 

581.43 586.71 A: go do something else that's going to benefit you instead of wasting your time in high school 

588.02 594.91 A: you know learning something that you don't even care about when you g- when you graduate if you do graduate 

596.19 599.90 A: is not going to take you anywhere [mn] because most kids if if they're not
