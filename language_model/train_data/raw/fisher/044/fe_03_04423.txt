197.74 198.84 B: uh 

197.86 205.51 A: uh es- especially if you really have a good friend you know [mn] that you've developed a friendship and relationship over 

204.45 215.67 B: and i'm as- i'm assuming that i mean if s- if it's somebody who's a good friend but you haven't seen in years and you may not see him i don't know it maybe a little different but if it's somebody you actually see 

215.16 226.40 A: yeah you're you're active with that's what i was just saying a friend that a a good friend that you are c- y- y- y- yeah it it could be your neighbor could be down at the you know a co worker that you been working with for years 

218.71 221.69 B: close you know v- value and uh 

224.27 225.33 B: yeah 

226.53 229.31 A: and you are sharing moments and time together 

229.36 231.50 A: (( you know that's kind of a little tough you know what i mean )) 

231.45 239.24 B: i think that would be very tough yeah yeah i think uh we we we don't have enough good close friends anyway 

233.34 235.88 A: [laughter] uh 

239.06 243.69 A: y- yeah exactly exactly i you're you're right about that to replace 

242.62 244.98 B: e- especially especially us men 

244.93 247.85 A: (( them [laughter] )) 

246.04 248.81 B: i mean women women have all kinds of friends 

248.25 251.47 A: y- oh yeah right right dude you're right y- you're right about that 

251.52 256.95 A: [noise] that women do have more friends and they can like [noise] go out together and you know what i mean 

251.69 253.17 B: mm 

256.64 259.11 B: yeah men men usually don't 

257.12 257.70 A: (( [noise] )) 

259.45 261.81 B: i don't why that's the case do you 

261.63 262.61 A: (( uh )) 

262.22 267.16 B: uh do you know why ah why is it that women tend to have more 

267.23 269.34 B: more close friends than men do 

269.38 273.07 A: ah because i think they also stick together 

273.17 274.52 A: (( um )) 

274.84 280.78 A: m- i don't know child raising and you know bearing and so forth they share more information 

281.02 282.74 A: (( [mn] y- you understand what i'm trying to say )) 

282.09 283.30 B: mhm 

283.04 290.56 A: they share more i don't know a man i mean we have kids too i mean we're the father [laughter] but um 

287.53 288.49 B: right 

290.71 297.58 A: i think with women it's just natural in a way and they share stick together for um strength and so forth 

296.98 298.16 B: right 

297.66 301.03 A: uh i don't know because if you look at nature you know uh 

301.19 309.97 A: some animals their females really stick together and the males are like on their own you know in in quite a few animals that happens you know 

306.39 308.28 B: yeah that's probably that's true 

309.40 310.65 B: (( yeah )) 

310.35 313.02 A: (( that the the males are not part of the herd )) 

312.68 313.73 B: yeah 

313.18 317.45 A: uh and the female are used to you know being together 

317.70 319.00 A: so uh 

318.10 321.14 B: was it was it was i hearing some water flowing 

320.77 334.14 A: yeah yeah yeah i just i just turned on the pipe [laughter] yeah i just turned on some water yeah but but but but like you said maybe maybe it is just something because as i said a man a man we're basically we're hunters right or whatever [laughter] 

323.73 326.29 B: oh oh okay okay [laughter] 

327.05 328.91 B: [laughter] 

332.85 337.59 B: well the men are yeah the the men are the hunters and the women are the gatherers 

336.94 342.43 A: gatherers so you gather well the gatherers work work together better i mean the hunters work together too right 

342.24 349.26 B: ah yeah uh depends um well i guess uh they used to when the when the animals were big 

342.50 345.61 A: (( um [laughter] )) 

349.50 350.97 A: when animals were big 

350.53 354.77 B: yeah ah i'm not sure if they still do 

351.55 352.87 A: okay 

355.14 358.83 B: uh well i mean they go together hunters people go hunting together 

359.13 360.72 A: (( right but and then you )) 

359.57 362.30 B: but it's a it's a little different 

361.79 367.12 A: y- yeah because because i said like i said to you before um i in many 

365.47 369.55 B: they don't they they're they're they don't talk very much when they hunt 

369.31 380.24 A: r- oh exactly you're right you don't communicate that much really okay y- you're right about that we don't get into um uh we we're hunting but we're not really interacting with each that much 

370.12 372.23 B: [laughter] 

379.15 380.50 B: (( mm )) 

380.29 388.49 A: you know what i mean just as you pointed out there well like i said many tribes and many um not just tribe people but animals the fewer 

381.04 382.02 B: yeah 

388.58 389.57 A: (( opportunities )) 

389.65 396.82 A: to be herd together you know what i mean just stay together i mean just to raise kids to ra- i mean to to raise their [mn] 

394.90 395.90 B: right 

396.92 399.32 A: their offspring and so forth you know what i mean 

398.94 402.01 B: i think the closest that um 

402.28 406.42 B: that men end up being stuck together is when they go ice fishing 

406.71 417.18 B: uh you know in minnesota they go ice fishing uh and they stay there like for a week and they live on the ice you know on the on the lake 

409.95 410.94 A: uh-huh 

416.93 418.42 A: (( yeah )) 

417.46 423.62 B: and uh all they do is they sit all day they dig a hole and they sit all day waiting for the fish to bite 

421.02 422.14 A: uh-huh 

423.42 424.42 A: uh-huh 

423.94 427.43 B: uh and so they they can't really travel very much 

427.50 432.31 B: and so they end up with but but i'm not sure how much they end up talking anyway 

431.97 434.64 A: [laughter] 

432.60 436.29 B: they they just sit there and stare at each other or something i don't know 

434.92 448.57 A: no y- yeah you see now you're back to that again you're back to that that we don't really say that much i mean we're busy uh hunting or or hunting or fishing or what have you but we're really not uh saying that much to each other you know uh so you have a point there too you know 

439.33 440.35 B: yeah 

445.15 446.12 B: yeah 

448.61 450.80 A: but uh um 

449.91 455.30 B: but still still uh i guess uh in spite of all that uh 

455.33 459.35 B: uh people wouldn't uh give up their friendships that easily even men 

458.76 469.49 A: mm no no if you really have a good friend solid friend for many years that like i say you've been through quite a bit ah you wouldn't just give it for a million dollars 

469.13 470.12 B: yeah 

469.45 478.21 A: i mean even if you're a poor man and you're you know [mn] you're really down and out but then again if you have a good friend and you're really down and out he might be helping you out too so 

478.30 479.68 A: (( y- you know what i mean )) 

479.25 483.03 B: yeah oh absolutely it's it's i guess that maybe if 

480.69 482.20 A: i- you know 

483.07 484.48 B: uh [cough] i wonder if 

484.87 487.49 B: somebody is really like you know destitute 

488.39 489.35 A: [mn] 

488.39 496.44 B: how how they would react to that but they they they must be in the same position i mean i don't know uh 

495.47 505.71 A: yeah yeah well you no you could be right about that too somebody who's like okay let's say for instance a panhandler in the street or or like a gro- a shopping cart lady or something like that 

503.10 504.59 B: (( mm mhm )) 

505.72 510.78 A: um and they out in the street usually those people have mental problems too you know what i mean 

511.02 516.96 A: uh but with someone like that right uh except y- 

515.72 517.28 B: yeah that's different 

517.21 521.44 A: yeah yeah that's completely different that's not your normal person you know that's not 

517.89 519.10 B: [laughter] 

521.16 523.09 B: (( no well there are people )) 

521.29 535.13 A: somebody you say is normal right because they're out in the street like that because they're living on their own and it would be difficult for you to say that that they will say yeah well i got a friend and we just sit down and or drink a bottle of wine or liquor [laughter] sometime but we're really not you know 

523.64 525.00 B: (( who are homeless so )) 

535.76 544.28 A: they're not that close close you know but they just hang out on the street two bums that hang out on the street all the time is not the same they might give up each other you know what i mean 

544.41 551.93 A: uh for the economic uh for the million dollars but i don't think that would be the same as you know looking at two normal uh y- you understand what i mean 

552.29 555.55 A: it would not be the same as just say looking at two normal people that uh 

555.64 557.53 A: that have friends and so forth 

558.04 559.66 A: but it is interesting 

559.93 561.24 A: what do you think 

562.53 564.32 A: can you hear me 

563.45 565.07 B: i can hear you fine 

564.77 566.60 A: oh okay yeah so it 

565.70 569.31 B: uh there are there are people who are homeless [lipsmack] 

569.32 577.04 B: um who are homeless not out of choice but uh because of circumstances like they lost their job 

573.77 574.37 A: (( [mn] )) 

574.73 576.27 A: (( it yeah )) 

576.68 578.44 A: yeah yeah [mn] 

577.51 583.95 B: and uh and they don't have any money and their their landlord kicks them out 

583.57 584.67 A: okay 

584.23 586.83 B: and they actually end up being homeless 

586.48 588.96 A: y- yes oh i know i know i know 

588.19 590.10 B: (( that's uh i- )) 

589.29 592.03 A: (( i know a lot of times it's not just out of choice )) 

591.50 593.59 B: it's v- it's very sad 

593.39 598.89 A: yeah and and not only that also as i said to you i found out that sometime a lot of them are mental cases too 

598.91 599.95 A: and what happened is
