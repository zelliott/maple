98.90 101.62 A: do you think the school system there is better or worse or 

100.69 110.04 B: [lipsmack] i think it's better because there's there's a higher tax base where i'm going where we live and um we're than where i was from 

104.21 105.23 A: okay 

109.55 110.69 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

110.18 114.81 B: so um although i had kind of a weird um 

114.90 126.17 B: qu- like some of my experience wasn't through the public school system some of it was so i shouldn't have said i was totally in the public school system but my par- my both um 

118.88 123.00 A: (( uh-huh mhm [noise] okay like um )) 

126.09 134.68 B: [lipsmack] well my dad's a professor and administrator at a college in upstate new york and there was a school attached to the college 

134.00 134.99 A: like a 

135.08 136.45 A: high school or 

135.84 137.76 B: it's called camper school 

137.62 139.20 A: w- what's that 

138.01 150.57 B: and um it was part of the college but it was sort of an experimental school and i went there for a few years but my parents felt like we weren't learning anything 'cause all we were doing was playing all day 

145.05 146.03 A: (( uh-huh mhm )) 

150.05 151.49 A: [laughter] 

150.68 158.86 B: so they they pulled out us and they put us in public school [laughter] and it got more regimented from there on but um 

153.89 154.84 A: (( gotta ya )) 

156.35 157.16 A: mhm 

159.16 164.25 B: [lipsmack] so the public school part when i think back when we're talking was more of my high school experience 

163.82 165.27 A: yeah same here [noise] 

164.67 168.58 B: yeah so did you go you went through public school straight through 

168.24 178.10 A: well um i only went through public school 'til middle school but in middle school i went i went to minor public school so it was a little different like i always had really good teachers and all the students were like really trying hard 

174.31 175.35 B: (( ah )) 

177.38 178.85 B: oh wow 

178.26 182.88 A: but i i didn't really like it there so i transferred out like and i went to a different high school and 

180.60 181.17 B: (( [mn] )) 

182.30 183.52 B: i see 

183.12 187.64 A: then my high school was it was a lot more relaxed like there definitely weren't a lot of good teachers there like you could um 

187.76 192.38 A: if you're willing to put the effort in they were willing to go like the extra mile to make sure you learned enough 

191.74 193.22 B: yeah 

192.50 195.02 A: but uh it's very easy to coast through 

194.85 202.61 B: yeah you could basically coast through if you wanted to but you but you're in college now what what school do you go to 

196.95 197.82 A: yeah 

200.18 201.22 A: mhm yes 

202.34 204.10 A: uh university of pennsylvania 

203.58 208.72 B: oh you do oh great i went to cornell yes so see we didn't do too badly 

204.19 205.03 A: mhm 

205.79 206.76 A: okay 

208.02 209.28 A: yeah 

208.75 211.53 B: [laughter] so that's good 

209.94 211.88 A: [laughter] i just finished my sophomore year 

212.08 213.03 B: sorry 

212.57 214.13 A: i just finished my sophomore year 

213.34 219.14 B: oh you finished congratulations so you've got two more years to go do you know what you want to do after 

215.80 216.57 A: yeah 

219.67 224.61 B: your i mean it's such a cruel question when you're finishing you're finishing sophomore year 

222.62 223.52 A: [laughter] 

223.91 226.14 A: well i figure after my senior i'll retire 

225.92 228.73 B: [laughter] oh 

227.66 228.57 A: [laughter] 

228.82 230.46 B: you go i 

229.61 232.23 A: is that the way it works sixteen years of school and you retire 

231.78 234.53 B: yeah exactly what's the problem 

233.23 234.00 A: [laughter] 

234.06 235.98 A: nothing it sounds good to me [laughter] 

235.31 239.87 B: (( it sounds like a great concept that's so funny um )) 

236.90 238.01 A: yeah 

239.57 249.55 A: i think like in philadelphia one of the big problems with um the public school system though is like it was under funded in like prob- probably in teachers 

248.95 250.66 B: yeah 

249.78 252.54 A: so like they're always gonna like shift teachers around you know 

251.46 252.98 B: oh no 

252.76 260.14 A: so it's very there's a strain on the teachers as well 'cause they had uh they work long hours and there wasn't always the right like the best equipment to use and 

259.59 260.79 B: oh yeah 

260.33 262.84 A: a lot of like students in the class and 

262.19 267.51 B: yeah i felt the same way because we have like textbooks that were like really horrible 

266.95 268.32 A: yeah same here 

267.47 272.98 B: and like ugh like it was like well you know how like in the inside of the textbook you write 

272.89 285.22 B: you know if it is in excellent condition then good and then fair and then poor well it would go like horrible and then you know like [laughter] a couple of rhymes below that [laughter] throw it out 

275.18 276.03 A: mhm 

277.39 278.33 A: yeah 

279.40 280.26 A: [laughter] 

281.83 284.55 A: please throw out [laughter] 

285.13 289.34 B: so i i completely understand about the um 

287.68 289.32 A: mhm 

289.66 290.75 A: right 

290.14 300.82 B: you know what there's my son walking in right now he's gonna run in and say hi to me uh but anyway we can keep talking that's fine um let's see um 

297.57 299.38 A: (( [laughter] [noise] mhm )) 

300.81 306.14 B: [lipsmack] i'm just gonna quickly say hi to him hi simon hi sweetie i'm on the phone 

306.66 310.85 B: i love you i'm on the phone did you have fun okay 

310.44 311.84 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

311.14 317.45 B: okay anyway sorry about that um so what else should we talk about with the the public school system 

313.39 314.32 A: (( that's okay )) 

316.19 321.36 A: um well do you think it can be improved any way or like how would you go about improving it 

321.06 327.43 B: improving it i would say that i would make sure the teachers had 

327.44 331.49 B: you know proper training and [noise] they were you know 

329.15 330.02 A: mhm 

331.59 336.85 B: had enough experience and they weren't just like thrown in immediately 

335.93 338.61 A: yeah well ex- experience is hard to get 

337.98 339.06 B: pardon me 

338.65 340.32 A: experience is hard to get 

339.78 341.82 B: that's true uh 

340.98 345.85 A: like i i know like in uh my high school sometimes you'd get tutors that were just fresh out of college 

345.25 347.24 B: yeah 

345.86 350.17 A: they didn't do too well [laughter] because the kids just walk all over them 

347.70 348.82 B: oh r- 

349.59 352.95 B: oh i know i know that's really hard 

352.44 356.46 A: yeah but there's really no other way you'd get the experience besides just to do it and learn 

356.00 359.43 B: yeah that's true sometimes you need to be thrown in 

356.71 357.59 A: so 

358.83 359.69 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

359.68 369.14 B: but um well also just i think you know what it actually comes down to funding and just like having resources and having smaller classes 

364.33 365.35 A: mhm 

366.59 367.35 A: right 

368.68 372.24 A: yeah i i know like in philadelphia the maximum class size is thirty three 

371.93 377.46 B: what are you serious you can go up to thirty three students in a class 

372.76 373.52 A: yeah 

373.84 374.99 A: yeah 

376.82 381.56 A: yeah but even then like sometimes there was like they've come out like fudge it and put like thirty five in 

381.17 383.79 B: wow that's a lot 

383.31 385.34 A: yeah they were big classes 

383.97 390.31 B: wow thirty three man that's like how does anyone get any attention 

390.18 392.02 A: how um how big were your classes 

391.74 399.16 B: well i don't think they were that big because i remember them being like oh gosh i mean they couldn't have been more 

399.51 402.03 B: twenty five because 

401.04 403.32 A: how how big was your whole school 

403.18 411.95 B: [lipsmack] well um our school was pretty big 'cause i'm trying 'cause i graduated in a class of um three hundred and twenty nine 

411.78 412.68 A: (( [noise] okay )) 

412.17 414.50 B: and um 

415.19 420.93 B: but the school was well it was a junior senior high so it was not just a high school 

420.42 422.07 A: mhm 

421.16 427.34 B: um so i'm trying to think there was about three hundred in each class maybe a little bit less 

427.35 431.75 B: but there were still i no there's no way there were thirty three kids in 

431.88 433.08 B: um 

432.04 435.78 A: okay so there were about twelve hundred kids in the whole like high school section then 

434.50 437.50 B: yeah i would say about twelve hundred 

436.16 439.13 A: yeah like in mine there was about three thousand 

438.51 439.98 B: wow 

439.58 440.94 A: yeah but 

440.15 441.59 B: (( wow )) 

441.18 444.29 A: but the very sad part is like there were three thousand students in 

443.35 445.54 B: that's like a small college 

445.10 450.51 A: yeah but anyway there were three thousand student for four years but only three hundred of them were students 

448.21 449.23 B: right 

450.20 451.36 B: right 

450.66 455.90 A: a thousand of 'em were freshmen and it like every year because a lot of people just keep failing and 

451.91 453.57 B: right oh wow 

455.21 457.06 B: oh no 

456.08 459.63 A: [laughter] yeah we we actually had a term for them we call them uh career freshmen 

457.44 458.28 B: oh 

459.22 461.81 B: oh no career freshmen 

461.25 462.45 A: yeah 

461.85 463.95 B: that's so bad 

463.30 468.87 A: yeah and so they all just stay there until eighteen and drop out so mhm 

466.67 468.45 B: really 

468.85 473.91 B: [lipsmack] wow what a bummer 'cause it so that kind of is demoralizing in a way 

470.31 471.73 A: yeah 

473.23 481.39 A: yeah 'cause they um one one of the big problems is the students are gonna have a lack of a like interest in it like you can you can't really make somebody learn if they don't feel like it 

480.83 482.59 B: no you can't 

482.39 489.99 A: but i must admit it's like a lot harder with large larger class sizes though 'cause like 'cause you can't give that like a student who doesn't wanna learn like more attention 

489.85 493.86 B: yeah that's yeah wow 

490.56 491.86 A: but [noise] 

494.09 496.53 B: that's a yeah that's a problem 

495.87 497.54 A: mhm 

497.17 505.17 B: so yeah i'm trying to think like what are both our biggest problem um our biggest problem was more like um 

505.23 505.79 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

506.58 521.10 B: we even though it was just sort of like in the boonies like there was nothing around and so there was like there were no really cool field trips there was nothing [noise] good to go to there was we were sort of isolated [noise] 

511.44 512.31 A: mhm 

517.14 517.94 A: yeah 

520.52 521.88 A: right 

521.29 523.62 B: you're a baby sweetie that's my son 

523.43 524.76 A: [laughter] 

524.09 534.92 B: okay hold on okay hold on one second okay here we go up we go all right there you go he's here on my lap um [lipsmack] let's see and um 

524.99 525.83 A: okay 

535.16 548.67 B: so i'm trying to think like there just it just wasn't a very culturally diverse atmosphere which kind of which is kind of a bummer [noise] and um that's a transformer sweetie i'm sorry to interrupt this 

540.78 541.88 A: (( mhm yeah [mn] )) 

547.77 548.98 A: (( that's okay )) 

548.66 552.54 B: um and so it was sort of a um 

553.23 561.14 B: [lipsmack] i don't know it just was even though you know it it was a college town it wasn't like a college town there 

557.97 559.21 A: (( mhm mhm [noise] )) 

561.21 568.89 B: you know it was real- it was really isolated physically so it was kind of you know not a um [lipsmack] 

569.29 570.57 B: (( not a )) 

571.16 575.78 B: i don't know just geographically physically just wasn't the ideal 

575.88 578.22 B: sort of surroundings for 

577.48 578.55 A: got ya 

578.33 579.79 B: yeah 

579.12 585.50 A: yeah there's one nice about philadelphia was 'cause it's so close to new york and d. c. and baltimore and 

584.90 587.91 B: yeah you must've had access to a lot of things 

587.07 592.68 A: yeah so liked take field trips to new york and see a play or go to d. c. or or go to like 

590.05 593.91 B: oh wow i know 'cause it's really not that far 

593.40 597.71 A: right it's like a few hours like they prepared us for everything we'd go to the mountains or the ocean 

597.15 598.97 B: oh wow 

598.51 599.89 A: it's a it's a great city
