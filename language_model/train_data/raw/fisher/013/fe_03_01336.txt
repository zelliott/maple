3.22 4.05 A: hi 

4.99 6.16 A: i'm jill 

6.05 7.55 B: jill hi jill 

7.17 8.43 A: how are you 

7.90 9.47 B: okay 

9.47 10.48 A: good 

10.17 14.45 B: i guess we just start talking this is my first time have you done any before now 

14.36 17.28 A: no i haven't this is my first time too 

15.37 16.36 B: okay 

16.81 23.65 B: okay good [laughter] well let's see i guess i'll start out by saying that ah 

18.11 19.09 A: [laughter] 

21.91 22.79 A: okay 

23.68 28.15 B: i don't feel that there's anything really wrong with um 

28.17 33.18 B: testing an employee on a job without letting the employee know 

33.29 41.07 B: and particularly when we're speaking of ah certain fields ah [noise] of work along the lines of um 

41.17 46.60 B: someone who is responsible for another person's life you know like at a hospital or 

45.72 47.10 A: sure 

46.61 48.78 B: an e._m._t. 

48.71 51.25 A: i was going to say someone who's going to be out driving like 

50.82 58.80 B: yes you know so i don't have a problem at all because you know there are so many methods now of people know that they are going to get a drug test 

51.96 53.92 A: a delivery person 

58.42 59.32 A: uh-huh 

58.82 65.87 B: basically all they'd have to do is ah go and get some kind of ah herbs or something that can ah 

66.04 68.54 B: cleanse it from their system you know right 

66.25 67.41 A: take that 

67.53 69.19 A: exactly 

68.91 69.97 B: so 

69.54 73.40 A: i know um my brother actually has a contracting business 

72.97 73.95 B: uh-huh 

73.67 77.62 A: and he's starting to to drug test his employees 

76.91 78.01 B: (( mhm )) 

77.64 92.42 A: just because they're up on roofs and and they're using tools and you know he has a he has a couple of young kids on his on his crew that he thought might be and he was like i'm just going to start doing it because i can't afford to have someone 

87.03 88.00 B: (( exactly mhm )) 

92.46 95.47 A: being high and falling off of a roof 

94.77 99.75 B: exactly because he's responsible for for getting insurance for them 

97.27 98.81 A: right 

99.39 110.19 A: yeah yeah and actually his insurance company is giving him a huge tax er not tax break but a huge premium break for doing the random testing 

109.70 111.24 B: oh really 

110.49 116.79 A: which yeah he was like well you know if an insurance company is going to give me this much of a break then i might as well do it 

116.32 118.29 B: mhm exactly 

117.64 125.63 A: so but i definitely think the same thing that if you're going to be if you're going to be able to hurt yourself or hurt somebody else 

125.08 134.56 B: right even if it's not a big thing to hurt yourself i mean if that's your choice because certainly if you're taking drugs you know that drugs are not a good thing so 

128.06 129.01 A: well 

129.24 130.41 A: [laughter] 

133.94 135.25 A: exactly 

134.79 143.40 B: you have made that decision to do that to your body but it should not be ah a decision you made that can affect another person 

138.33 139.25 A: right 

143.09 145.25 A: put on someone else right 

145.06 159.72 B: i think another subject or rather source that i'd be most concerned about making sure that they ah check on a very regular basis and not just for drugs but alcohol as well and that would be the pilots 

159.92 164.27 B: you know people fly every day and they don't know you know how high 

161.75 162.70 A: uh-huh 

164.64 168.33 B: the pilot [laughter] is that's you know in control of their lives 

167.75 168.98 A: sure 

169.17 174.62 A: i definitely think that that's that's a good one even the bus drivers or the the train drivers 

174.48 175.87 B: exactly 

175.12 181.08 A: you know i i live um i live in the d._c. area so you know i think about the cab drivers all the time 

180.50 182.36 B: oh yes definitely 

181.54 191.26 A: but getting into a cab i mean that's scary enough as it is half the time anyhow but getting into a cab with someone is is always a big concern to find out 

185.75 186.78 B: it is 

190.65 191.99 B: mhm 

191.37 193.69 A: you know to make sure that they're not 

193.76 196.99 A: intoxicated or on drugs or anything 

196.62 201.05 B: right and again doctors you know definitely you know you're 

201.07 205.26 B: getting ready to go under the knife and you might have a doctor who's about to 

205.30 213.73 B: perform surgery on you and he or she is higher than you are when they give you the drugs to knock you out [laughter] 

212.14 215.90 A: right [laughter] because they have such access to it too 

214.92 225.20 B: yeah because ah you find nowadays all kind of suits going on where doctors you know were supposed to have been a very simple um operation you know 

224.96 225.80 A: uh-huh 

225.47 228.29 B: like an append what is it appendicitis 

228.01 228.93 A: uh-huh 

228.59 238.68 B: you know and a person dies from it you know and you never know what actually went wrong i mean the doctor could have been high and and left [laughter] an instrument or something in the person you know 

238.43 240.19 A: exactly 

239.90 241.08 B: yeah 

240.81 241.90 A: uh-huh 

241.87 243.72 B: so where do you work 

243.48 247.24 A: i'm actually a education director for a learning centre 

246.93 248.33 B: for a learning centre 

247.97 249.06 A: uh-huh 

248.59 251.95 B: so you guys have to do random drug testing there 

251.63 253.99 A: no we don't actually 

253.30 254.23 B: (( really mm )) 

254.18 260.54 A: but that would be you know i mean anything in the education field that you're going to be working with kids all day too is another one 

260.61 268.82 A: i've actually never heard of i've been in the education field for ten years and never heard of anybody in my field actually 

268.94 270.11 A: having any 

270.31 271.56 A: kind of so 

270.53 271.57 B: right 

271.68 272.88 A: what about you 

272.84 279.90 B: well i actually work ah for myself i'm a real estate investor and public relations consultant 

278.48 279.40 A: okay 

279.91 286.96 B: so um and of course i don't touch drugs so i don't have any concern but you know i many many years ago 

282.80 284.06 A: (( uh-huh right )) 

287.10 292.06 B: ah we probably all have had our days where we smoked a little pot or whatever 

291.88 293.08 A: sure 

292.38 299.26 B: but back in those days um you know there would be times when i was contemplating changing jobs 

298.67 299.68 A: uh-huh 

299.26 311.07 B: and i would ah you know abstain from it for months sometime a year or two years i mean not that i was ever a user a big user but maybe do it recreationally 

308.23 309.27 A: uh-huh 

311.13 322.06 B: but ah i would go years you know because i would be telling people all you know i'm looking for a good job and i knew that some of the fortune five hundred companies particularly 

321.70 322.75 A: uh-huh 

322.16 330.40 B: with the bigger names would always have drug testing it was just a requirement in fact on a number of the jobs that i've held ah 

330.47 336.73 B: over the years working for the police department as as a nine one one operator required it 

333.12 333.93 A: okay 

336.67 338.59 A: and were you ever tested 

338.48 340.21 B: ah yeah we were tested 

339.67 340.56 A: okay 

340.22 341.32 B: yes 

341.04 341.95 A: uh-huh 

341.54 350.71 B: yeah but again you know there are methods ah you know like i know this guy who is in the car bu- business you know typically um 

350.81 358.42 B: people in sales you know they take some kind of drugs whether it's alcohol or something to keep them going because they are really never 

353.98 355.05 A: [laughter] 

358.49 360.08 B: (( off of )) 

359.07 360.64 A: off of duty 

360.07 373.88 B: right you know because i sold cars before myself and i know most of the people that i worked with were either very very heavy smokers ah cigarettes or coffee drinkers or drugs or something 

371.64 372.66 A: uh-huh 

374.03 381.59 B: and 'cause it was necessary but but fortunately i never did any of course i didn't stay in that business for six months 

376.24 377.36 A: right 

380.97 382.11 A: uh-huh 

381.65 387.36 B: but for people like truck drivers there's another example now you know those guys are on something 

387.29 388.33 A: right 

387.71 391.65 B: you know and they endanger our lives every day and every night 

391.21 392.21 A: uh-huh 

391.93 393.52 B: do you do a lot of travelling 

393.32 403.13 A: ah i don't travel a whole lot actually i mean we do a lot of a lot of east coast a lot of road trips type of travelling i have a young child so 

402.09 402.94 B: oh 

403.11 404.23 B: (( what age )) 

403.98 405.94 A: she's fourteen months 

405.47 407.17 B: oh very young 

406.56 408.77 A: [laughter] yeah very young [laughter] 

408.03 409.50 B: [laughter] 

409.32 418.44 A: so and i know we took her on a plane trip last year and the airplane just killed her you know she screamed for most of the plane trip we went to 

416.90 418.13 B: [laughter] 

418.77 423.19 A: san francisco so we've been trying to stay off of any airplanes 

422.16 423.88 B: oh [laughter] 

423.26 427.86 A: so we have to put her on [laughter] she's had a she's had a lot of ear problems 

427.17 430.82 B: oh yeah and up in that plane would add to it right 

429.04 435.78 A: yeah getting up on that plane just really really did it for her so we've been trying to just stick to the east coast 

435.80 446.06 A: my husband is my husband's in the restaurant business and you know when you just mentioned the coffee or the cigarettes or something he he's like a coffee addict 

438.65 439.65 B: (( mhm )) 

445.53 446.81 B: oh really 

446.23 451.64 A: i mean he drinks like a cup of coffee or a pot of coffee himself before even going into work in the mornings 

451.23 453.08 B: you're kidding 

452.61 459.41 A: no he's crazy about it [laughter] and before he got into the restaurant business he was in the service 

454.53 456.94 B: (( wow )) 

459.77 466.52 A: so i think just being a serviceman and being used to being up you know like on late shifts he was on submarines 

463.36 464.54 B: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

466.80 473.80 A: that he just got into this coffee and he'll drink he'll drink like two or three cups of regular coffee and go straight to bed at night 

473.37 475.06 B: (( mhm really )) 

474.44 477.39 A: yeah it doesn't it doesn't affect him at all 

475.52 478.05 B: it doesn't affect him at all 

477.58 479.01 A: not at all 

478.39 491.41 B: i'm not a big coffee drinker so ah i use it like if i'm going to be traveling to help keep me up and it would definitely keep me up if i drank a cup of coffee at night especially three cups like him i would not be able to go to sleep 

483.65 484.56 A: uh-huh 

484.63 485.65 A: sure 

491.73 502.70 A: yeah i can i can drink like eight cups you know with dinner and late at night if we're out or something but any more than that then the caffeine is doing it to me too 

496.85 497.93 B: mhm 

503.42 508.95 A: but with the with the baby and everything sometimes i'm like oh just let me drink a cup of coffee while she's out 

508.98 509.62 B: (( yeah )) 

509.83 511.67 B: (( [laughter] yeah really )) 

511.40 514.40 A: to keep myself going but i could definitely 

514.51 518.05 A: i'm a coffee drinker too but not anything you know 

517.60 519.70 B: not nearly as much as his huh 

519.17 524.30 A: no not at all [laughter] and actually before we met i didn't drink coffee at all so 

523.46 525.20 B: oh really 

524.45 525.53 A: (( yeah )) 

525.23 526.85 B: [laughter] 

526.09 528.14 A: [laughter] we met 

527.12 531.33 B: i guess if you were going to stay with him you had to become a coffee drinker 

529.41 530.81 A: exactly 

530.86 535.46 A: we met in college so i guess i was just at that age you know where you're starting 

532.29 533.24 B: (( [laughter] )) 

535.48 539.60 A: starting on the coffee but before that i wasn't a coffee drinker at all 

536.99 537.74 B: yeah 

539.04 551.44 B: yeah well that's when i started drinking heavily coffee in college you know to stay up study for those exams crashing because you party all week and then when it's time for the exam then you've got to crash the night before 

541.89 542.88 A: uh-huh 

544.85 546.17 A: exactly 

551.00 552.15 A: uh-huh 

552.33 559.34 B: [laughter] but i guess back on the subject 'cause they are recording this so i guess we need to talk more about um 

559.90 564.16 B: our opinion on whether we feel that 

564.21 565.59 B: it's okay 

565.36 568.97 A: do you think that there's anybody that it's not okay for them to test 

568.68 576.02 B: well um again if it's not affecting another person's ah life 

575.81 576.77 A: uh-huh 

576.08 577.60 B: (( then ah )) 

577.67 586.94 B: i don't see it necessary because people you know are grown and they're able to make their own decisions and they deal with the repercussions ah 

579.71 580.67 A: sure 

586.94 599.89 B: you know from what they do to their bodies but again if it's a profession any profession and i'm sure there are numerous where another person can be affected then i i don't feel that it's a problem at all 

589.25 590.42 A: uh-huh
