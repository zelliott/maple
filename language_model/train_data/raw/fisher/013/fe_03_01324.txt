30.69 33.80 A: so minimum wage is is the topic for today 

30.72 31.20 B: so 

35.00 36.52 A: and i don't know really how to 

36.86 43.85 A: go ahead and explore this but uh wh- what are your thinking your feeling about minimum wage you think right now it's 

44.12 46.32 A: it's a uh good figure for 

46.65 48.66 A: people that work by hourly wages 

49.74 50.56 B: um 

50.74 52.44 B: right now um 

53.34 57.52 B: no well i haven't been paid minimum wage in a long time so 

57.75 60.58 B: that that's kind of hard um 

59.81 64.47 A: but you know generally what what people complain a lot about not being paid 

65.31 66.01 B: well 

65.31 66.28 A: sufficient right 

66.70 69.95 B: yeah because i mean five dollars isn't really get you anywhere anymore 

70.09 72.63 A: right a sandwich costs five dollars right 

71.08 71.69 B: you know 

73.10 73.63 B: yeah at most 

73.83 75.62 B: five fifteen whatever i 

76.19 80.47 B: five twenty five but it really doesn't even even get you anything anymore 

81.44 82.05 B: you know 

82.79 83.28 A: well 

82.94 83.37 B: i it 

85.00 87.33 A: i i guess y- you're exactly right it doesn't 

87.59 89.19 A: and and inflation 

89.60 90.76 A: uh is rising 

91.45 93.55 A: uh we saw fuel energy costs 

94.10 95.15 A: uh you know go up 

95.72 97.06 A: uh this past 

98.14 99.42 A: fall and the winter 

100.25 102.90 A: and uh i don't know what they blame it on 

103.61 103.87 A: but 

104.33 107.12 A: i feel for people that was on minimum wage be able to make 

107.42 109.23 A: the payments like for the gas 

109.78 112.85 A: natural gas either for the electric or the power bill 

113.30 113.78 B: yeah 

114.61 115.17 A: i know 

115.65 117.62 A: the figures the cost here has 

117.86 118.88 A: gotten into 

119.26 119.91 A: i think it was like 

120.18 124.54 A: almost like a dollar por- per therm for natural gas 

124.20 124.88 B: oh wow 

125.41 129.55 A: point and so they was expected to go even higher so i don't know what the last numbers were 

130.36 130.74 A: but 

130.85 133.56 A: i was fortunate and i normally follow it pretty closely 

133.84 140.56 A: to sign up uh with a uh a plan they had where they'll guarantee the fixed therm rate for like a year 

141.18 141.66 B: uh huh 

141.44 145.04 A: so i i escaped the bullet on that this year so (( )) 

145.52 151.12 A: that it'll coming up the next year this next season i'll be able to do the same thing to re- to sign up again 

151.76 154.00 A: and it keeps your payment fixed 

154.18 155.34 A: uh and people 

155.66 156.85 A: have minimum wage 

157.45 159.69 A: get paid minimum wage they definitely need to be on 

159.82 162.60 A: everything is fixed in from their gas uh 

163.04 168.94 A: their power bill you know any kind of bill they have to be a fixed amount so they know exactly how much they're paying each month 

169.36 169.92 B: yeah 

169.41 170.31 A: and they won't get a 

170.58 171.14 A: um 

171.65 173.93 A: shock when they get the bill in the mail 

174.84 175.91 A: cause i can imagine 

176.14 179.26 A: you know paying uh being being paid five dollars an hour 

179.91 181.33 A: uh it's almost un- 

181.91 182.75 A: -heard of un- 

184.03 184.51 B: yeah 

185.79 186.73 B: yeah and 

187.07 190.75 B: even see i'm making seven an hour and 

191.41 193.54 B: that's even a struggle just to pay 

193.82 195.30 B: by the time you you have 

195.52 196.77 B: gas electricity 

197.29 197.83 B: um 

198.32 199.22 B: insurance 

199.49 200.12 B: phone 

201.10 203.84 B: you know just your your basics and 

205.14 206.75 B: (( )) that really makes it tough 

206.95 207.84 B: you know i 

208.12 209.34 B: it's only a one income 

209.56 210.61 B: family so 

210.32 212.28 A: okay so you head of household right 

212.60 213.01 B: yes 

214.15 216.41 B: yeah i'm i'm a single mom and 

216.65 218.72 B: and um on top of diversions 

218.92 219.99 B: (( )) and 

220.70 222.92 B: you know it's it takes 

223.46 223.72 B: it 

224.41 228.91 B: it you know seven dollars is just i'm barely squeaking by and 

230.13 230.71 B: you know 

232.05 234.81 B: it's crazy but 

235.01 240.70 B: i i can't imagine i i don't know how i would be able to make it if i was only making five dollars an hour 

240.92 241.35 B: or five 

241.53 242.37 B: five fifteen 

243.40 243.84 B: so 

244.94 248.77 A: and i don't know it like like you were saying you hadn't uh had that in a while 

249.11 252.27 A: but i guess the last time i must of had a minimum wage is when i 

257.35 257.95 B: yeah 

261.03 262.85 A: cost of living was way down so 

263.11 267.41 A: it it really did equate so it kind of equalized and equalled out 

268.10 271.46 A: but uh now it just too much disparity in in 

271.86 276.30 A: what things cost uh to be able to live and uh you know in a way 

276.41 278.60 A: comfortable as opposed to just existence 

279.03 284.48 A: and i guess eh at um minimum wage you you would basically be existing you wouldn't really be living 

284.98 285.41 B: yeah 

286.07 287.25 B: yeah exactly 

288.03 289.45 A: uh there's a new 

290.45 293.67 A: i i work out of the home so i have a office in my home and it it 

294.05 294.74 A: this particular 

295.39 300.28 A: uh venture gave me (( )) stopping off point change gears and do something 

300.67 302.74 A: else from what i'm doing during the course of a day 

303.30 304.88 A: but uh i i looked 

305.76 307.22 A: at at that uh 

308.02 314.51 A: question and and i almost you know it it cringes when i think about it and and i feel for a lot of people who have to 

315.85 317.74 A: just off that amount of money 

318.23 323.26 A: um per week uh by the hour that is but it it's just unheard of and 

323.56 325.17 A: it needs to be reevaluated 

325.65 329.28 A: and as opposed to a minimum wage i think they needs to go to 

329.54 332.48 A: a living wage what cost what's the cost of living 

332.69 334.43 A: you know for someone to be able to live 

333.03 333.40 B: yeah 

334.91 336.98 A: as opposed to what's minimal 

337.69 340.03 A: uh i (( )) comparison 

340.40 341.05 A: against 

341.43 346.60 A: uh we got our values all mixed up in the country now we we pay to be entertained 

346.72 348.00 A: more than we pay 

348.40 350.45 A: uh for things that are necessity 

351.02 351.60 B: yeah 

351.07 351.99 A: uh every day 

353.80 354.68 B: (( )) 

354.81 357.07 B: that's the thing with me i don't even have a t._v. 

357.20 359.93 B: you know i don't i don't go to the movies i don't 

360.35 363.30 B: i don't do anything i can't afford to do anything

369.26 370.27 B: free set 

370.80 371.62 B: the first 

372.21 374.10 B: um game or whatever 

374.36 375.12 B: and 

376.04 379.21 B: and i've thought about doing that but you still have to rent your shoes and (( )) 

379.56 382.87 B: i don't even have the money to rent my shoes you know so 

383.25 385.25 B: it it's like 

386.56 388.51 B: if if i can't make it 

388.71 394.80 B: on what i'm making now how can i do it no i'm not making forty hours a week either 

394.98 395.45 B: um 

396.26 397.04 B: but 

397.31 397.78 B: if 

398.46 400.22 B: especially those that 

400.67 406.10 B: are making minimum wage if they have children they're paying daycare plus all their other bills 

407.04 409.74 B: eh you know no wonder why people are 

410.33 413.37 B: cold and hungry in in the united states 

414.22 414.68 B: you know 

414.86 417.06 B: you would expect to see that in 

417.17 418.58 B: third world countries 

418.71 419.02 B: but 

419.26 420.37 B: this is the u._s. 

420.93 423.40 A: well things have gone uh the system 

423.68 425.48 A: as it is for the income 

425.81 426.84 A: has gone out of 

427.37 428.20 A: uh whack 

428.31 430.06 A: and it needs to be um 

430.24 432.59 A: i i hate to say this it needs to be readjusted 

433.20 433.65 A: um 

434.22 438.68 A: you know we we saw all of the history we seen all the history from the other 

438.82 442.30 A: nations and from the other countries and we still have not learned 

442.53 444.24 A: from the history from what happened there 

444.79 445.17 B: yeah 

444.80 448.01 A: you know like in uh in france when they had the revolt 

448.43 451.61 A: you know they went in and they you know lowly took the uh 

452.25 454.34 A: the uh the monarchy and you know they 

454.68 457.41 A: (( )) them away out of the uh palaces and they killed her 

458.22 458.73 A: so 

458.88 460.84 A: if that's what's going to wind up happening cause 

461.13 463.20 A: it at one point they had 

463.54 464.33 A: people that was 

464.64 469.78 A: making some money and then it got completely out of whack (( )) you only now had a select few 

470.47 470.82 A: that 

471.26 475.83 A: became the uh the ruling class and they the one that had all the resources 

476.44 477.67 A: uh for the country 

478.20 479.92 A: and that's what's happen here we got 

480.35 482.67 A: got two percent of the people that controlling 

483.23 485.24 A: all the resources for the whole country 

485.72 486.23 B: mhm 

488.03 488.94 A: take for instance 

489.43 489.95 A: um 

490.26 492.08 A: mister bill gates no one 

492.74 494.86 A: have ever can see that anyone can 

495.31 495.71 A: can 

496.06 500.91 A: (( )) afford to be able to have ninety to hundred billion dollars is 

501.53 502.90 A: you know it's almost unreal 

503.20 506.71 A: that mean he he does not live in the real world 

507.34 507.73 B: yeah 

507.39 510.71 A: you know th- th- the echelon that he's in they don't live in the real world 

510.93 511.32 B: yeah 

511.09 512.93 A: and it in essence what we've done 

513.45 513.95 A: we 

514.10 517.66 A: left this count- left um europe and the uh and the british 

518.12 519.18 A: to escape 

519.61 524.68 A: uh a class system but we came here and we we instead of having a royal class 

525.05 527.00 A: we created a financial class system 

527.54 528.04 B: yeah 

527.87 531.97 A: where we got uh a few people that's controlling the majority of the wealth 

532.87 535.64 A: so uh it's getting really out of hand and
