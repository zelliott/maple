14.85 17.91 A: i you know uh somewhat 

18.67 19.71 A: i do 

20.22 28.99 B: i i believe that it shouldn't be televised due to the fact that i know in most cases it's not true but 

28.99 37.31 B: these people are presumed innocent and if they are innocent there's actually someone out there that's guilty and they're getting to see all the information we have about them 

37.43 39.16 A: yeah that's right too 

40.08 46.02 B: and um you know it there's things that only the person that did it would know 

45.66 47.29 A: yeah 

46.40 50.30 B: and that's information they're releasing possibly out there to someone 

50.44 51.80 A: mhm

77.09 81.20 B: and they showed a lot of information on there you know 

81.55 91.33 B: everything was televised and everybody knew everything and that's just not safe because at that point they didn't know if he had done it by himself or if there were other people out there

93.73 94.30 B: (( [cough] ))

294.27 305.35 B: just you know some way associated with it but can't be there would like to see it you know televised on t._v. you know and that may be maybe they should have certain closed circuit you know where

306.19 307.31 A: (( that's right ))

345.19 346.24 A: okay 

345.91 360.06 B: [laughter] no they they are at a really good age but they are at an age where they ask a lot of questions and they're very observant as to what's going on you know especially like all the war that's going on right now i think they televise way too much you know 

351.87 353.96 A: yes that's right 

359.36 361.22 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

360.20 372.02 B: let us know what's going on let us be aware and prepared for what we need to be but don't show us every single thing about every person that's been killed and it causes a lot of depression for people and stuff 

372.52 381.03 B: they they they really should be a lot a lot more censored in a lot of things not just trials but war and criminal on the news 

379.65 381.31 A: (( yeah the war ))
