25.92 31.81 A: formal exercise like um you know walking a lot or doing a lot of [cough] uh 

32.30 35.36 A: work around the house or doing an active kind of job 

35.30 44.78 B: [cough] no well what yeah i do have an active job and um actually it's gonna get more intense because i'm getting ready to get a new job in sales so i'll be walking like a whole lot 

44.72 58.68 B: but for right now i do walk a lot up and down steps i'm still in s- well i go to school and i work a full time job and i was working like part time at a department store so i was walking around putting the clothes back on the racks so i get a lot of walking in 

58.65 59.84 B: but as far 

58.76 65.74 A: well you know that probably amounts to at least as much exercise as you do in an hour at the gym 

65.20 66.37 B: really 

66.26 69.10 A: i think so that's what they tell me 

66.58 67.25 B: i'm 

67.96 78.89 B: oh really but see that's the only exercise that i get in i mean just basically walking just like school and work and stuff like that but other than that no so um 

79.00 88.22 B: how well i did have a gym membership and i went one time and i had this membership for two years and i went once [laughter] so [cough] no 

84.32 85.98 A: mhm 

86.77 96.52 A: well i do try to go because it uh i have more of a sedentary job i y- i could spend a whole lotta time just uh sitting down 

96.90 103.35 A: and so so if i don't find reasons to get out and do things uh i don't get much exercise 

97.11 98.04 B: okay 

103.10 113.59 B: oh okay yeah but even on a day like today it's you know it was a nice day i got out i took a walk just like on my lunch break you know and stuff like that yeah because it was nice 

110.96 120.84 A: yeah that's great i think that's [cough] i think that's great i mean i i had to do some shopping today so instead of taking the car i walked because it was such a beautiful day 

119.28 120.30 B: (( oh okay )) 

120.55 126.94 B: yeah it was really nice so um but other than that no but i would like to actually get into another gym 

126.93 139.87 B: um but basically more than just like to exercise on the machines i would rather do stuff like um the aerobics class or something like that or even taking up like a karate course or something like that i don't think 

139.95 145.18 B: i don't know i just don't wanna get on a treadmill i don't wanna do that i mean i just wanna 

144.39 150.22 A: those things are kinda boring you know i do have to say that the classes are more fun except uh 

146.35 147.39 B: yeah 

150.41 161.31 A: um uh the gym that i belong to is almost all college students and the ones who participate in the classes are mostly young women 

156.46 157.60 B: oh okay 

161.25 162.31 B: yeah 

161.39 167.86 A: and uh as i'm older and a guy i feel kinda outta place in those classes so 

166.30 169.67 B: [laughter] yeah [cough] 

169.79 178.17 B: but i mean but then when i do go to the gym i went to lucile roberts like the one time and it was like for all women i mean it was okay but 

178.17 189.20 B: mm i g- i don't think i really liked it too much i mean and then i will like to do water aerobics [mn] i wanna learn how to swim because i can't swim to get some form of exercise and but um 

180.76 181.67 A: (( uh-huh )) 

189.11 194.38 B: [lipsmack] i haven't even found a gym that i could really do that that's like really close to where i'm working 

194.29 200.69 A: yeah well um uh have you done karate for a long time 

194.58 195.35 B: so 

196.17 196.84 B: no 

199.59 202.23 B: i haven't done karate that's something i would want to 

201.38 203.82 A: oh i see that's something you were thinking about doing 

202.99 205.68 B: yeah as a form of exercise i think that [cough] 

204.75 211.69 A: well i have a seven year old son who started doing it about a year ago and he really likes it it's meant a great deal to him 

208.71 209.56 B: uh-huh 

211.80 226.51 A: um mo- less as a form of exercise and more because it gives him a certain kind of discipline and social group of other kids that are interested in it and stuff like that he really responded well to it 

225.93 229.93 B: oh really that's good well maybe i'll look into it 

230.05 231.12 B: (( yeah i )) 

230.24 234.43 A: yeah i i haven't tried it myself but it's certainly been good for him 

234.19 242.42 B: mean because i've i've felt like okay you're you're still doing getting your heart rate up you know you're moving your body around you can still get really [laughter] oh wow [cough] sometimes in unison or 

241.20 254.49 A: well i i'll tell you f- um for him for the kids his age it's really like dance for boys that's what it is i think it it or like ballet for you know or modern dance or something for guys because uh 

248.05 249.32 B: (( sometimes individually )) 

254.48 258.72 A: they don't really do any fighting they just do these pattern movements 

258.50 260.04 B: (( so in a way it's a lot like an aerobics )) 

259.43 260.46 A: um 

260.25 261.00 B: (( class )) 

261.43 262.22 A: (( kinda )) 

263.15 264.87 A: (( like aerobic )) 

265.25 266.43 B: (( oh okay )) 

265.95 268.34 A: dancing or something 

267.50 270.09 B: (( oh okay well that's not bad at all )) 

270.29 280.73 B: that's really not bad i i mean i don't like it i mean just something when you can interact see i like the interaction part like if you go to the gym i mean you're just like basically by yourself you're working out 

280.55 285.31 B: you know and i like to meet people and get out and talk to people and different things like that 

285.24 297.60 B: so i wanna do something like that's more interactive i mean like karate okay it's interactive you can meet other people and you're not just like at table then we do karate or then we move to this then we move to that somewhere how 

296.48 298.47 A: did you ever do any team sports 

298.52 302.03 B: [lipsmack] mm out of high school no [noise] 

302.51 309.41 A: w- when i was younger when i was uh in the army and after i got out of the army i did uh 

309.48 313.36 A: uh you know basketball in leagues 

312.70 313.76 B: okay 

313.38 319.10 A: and i always enjoyed that but then my knees started to give out and i had to give it up 

316.94 318.14 B: yeah 

318.26 321.49 B: see i mean and i really don't have like um a weight problem 

321.40 334.85 B: so the only thing that i would rally wanna do if i wanted to lose anything would be like just to tone up and like tone up my stomach but that would be the only thing i mean i i don't have a weight problem but yet and still i mean even just being healthy 

334.70 338.49 B: you know you need to work out and it's good for your heart and all that 

338.01 344.82 A: yeah well i think especially as to get older to keep your heart in good shape and stuff like that it's good to get into the habit 

343.88 349.80 B: yeah it's good to get into the habit i mean like right now i'm just tw- i'm twenty eight i'll be twenty nine in september 

349.85 351.15 B: so um 

351.26 357.78 B: i don't know i guess maybe i'm not as concerned as i should be because i'm not like older i don't know 

357.60 363.40 A: yeah well you you're lucky you're in in good shape and you have a pretty active life it sounds like 

363.13 370.31 B: yeah i do so i mean as far as getting a lot of walking in i do i mean just working at the department store i mean part time 

370.23 382.30 B: four hours you're on your feet i mean that's part time like after my regular job four hours you're on your feet you're not sitting down you're constantly moving around so i mean you think about that i mean in itself that is a lot of exercise 

380.43 383.10 A: th- that's quite a lot of exercise actually 

382.68 395.80 B: yeah i mean that really is and you're constantly walking and moving and you're helping people and you're constantly moving and going and you're picking stuff up off the floor and putting it back up and you know i mean so it's just like it's somewhat of yeah somewhat of [mn] 

395.90 397.63 B: exercise but um 

398.42 403.04 B: i mean that's just about it and i'm like by the time i get home from there i am tired 

403.75 417.25 A: yeah well i found somebody tol- you know somebody pointed out to me that there are a lot of activities of everyday life that really are pretty good exercise and the good thing about taking that attitude is that there's all kinds of things 

403.89 404.55 B: (( [cough] )) 

412.98 413.89 B: uh-huh 

417.26 419.64 A: you need to do like you know uh 

419.75 423.93 A: mop the floor and take out the trash and stuff like that and if you uh 

422.09 422.92 B: [noise] right 

423.76 435.95 A: view it as something positive not just something that has to be done but something that actually does you some good as well as doing your environment some good um it uh helps make your life better that's what i've found 

434.58 437.99 B: so do you think that people can be healthy without exercise 

437.87 449.14 A: well [mn] it's a question of what kind of exercise after all right so if you're if you're living an active life if you're doing all kinds of physical work 

442.67 443.98 B: (( yeah i'll go with that )) 

449.41 457.40 A: uh walking a lot you know doing cleaning around the house doing you know building things fixing things whatever 

457.45 460.07 A: if you have a job that involves a lotta 

460.11 466.61 A: movement and lifting and going from place to place you're probably pretty healthy that's what i think 

465.42 469.37 B: yeah um my doctor says that i'm pretty healthy but um i 

469.73 477.95 B: mean i was just wondering i'm like do you think there are people you know because i mean there are some people who don't do exercise that i think are healthy then there are some people 

478.18 484.82 B: who um do exercise i mean and there have been people that worked out at the gym and had heart attacks you know 

484.60 486.43 A: yeah well it certainly 

484.97 487.07 B: even if you have a heart attack at the gym 

486.53 489.45 A: it comes to everybody sooner or later i guess [laughter] but 

489.48 490.58 B: (( i don't know i guess )) 

489.56 497.56 A: but i i think a completely sedentary life is just not too good for you and i can say that as somebody who has lived a sedentary life some of his life 

497.46 504.63 B: yeah you're right and i guess you know what along with the exercise i guess you have to really like eat healthy and stuff like that you know 

504.28 506.26 A: mhm 

504.89 511.77 B: i think that means a lot and it has a lot to do with it the thing is if you're not putting the right things in your body it really doesn't matter what you're doing 

512.04 513.01 B: (( you know )) 

512.88 515.25 A: yeah that's right 

514.74 518.52 B: so i think it's important to put the right things in your body as well 

518.54 519.42 B: so 

519.62 524.91 B: i mean as far as health foods and stuff like that are you like health conscious as far as foods are concerned 

527.12 532.55 A: do you uh make most of your own food do you eat out a lot 

531.93 533.69 B: no i eat out a lot 

534.51 536.99 B: [lipsmack] yeah so that's not healthy 

537.20 542.86 A: well i guess it depends on where you go but it actually is pretty hard to find healthy food eating out 

542.30 547.91 B: well you know what i think they do have like a couple of health food places i mean that are 

548.31 550.09 B: in city philadelphia 

549.80 551.58 A: mhm 

550.20 555.37 B: so are either like in ballerkinlet i think there's a place up there in um 

555.67 561.42 B: [lipsmack] like a little vegetarian place but i mean i haven't tried it yet but i would like to 

561.49 564.32 B: as far as just being healthy you know overall 

565.32 566.38 B: it's just like 

565.63 568.16 A: [mn] excuse me 

567.12 571.73 B: just like as far as being healthy overall like the entire body you know 

570.88 573.73 A: yeah yeah 

572.55 573.33 B: so 

574.26 575.26 B: (( [noise] i don't know )) 

575.64 576.81 B: so um 

576.90 580.56 B: what other forms of exercise do you do except for working out at the gym 

580.99 585.13 A: well i wind up walking three or four miles a day 

582.67 583.36 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

585.30 587.55 A: um because i uh 

587.75 593.26 A: you know live in the city in a situation where i really don't need to use the car very often 

592.59 595.14 B: [noise] okay [noise] 

593.84 599.89 A: and so when i go to the grocery store i walk and that's about a mile back and forth and uh
