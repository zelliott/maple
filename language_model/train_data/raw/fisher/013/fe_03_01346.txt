0.18 1.30 B: hello 

0.87 2.26 A: (( hi there )) 

1.96 4.74 B: hi um well i'm nicole 

4.74 6.27 A: nicole hi i'm taya 

5.29 10.04 B: yeah hi um and we're supposed to talk about censorship 

9.41 16.49 A: yeah um i i think it was ah do schools have the right to forbid kids from reading certain books 

15.40 21.06 B: ah okay this is the first one i've done on this okay good [laughter] 

17.17 21.13 A: (( yeah me too [laughter] so i don't know what do you think )) 

21.06 35.22 B: um no i don't think i think it's up to the parents and that if it's a controversial kind of book that they maybe a letter should be sent home or you know something should be discussed with the parents but it's not up to the school to make that kind of um decision 

22.01 22.74 A: no 

35.13 41.80 A: [mn] so y- are you talking about reading the book at all or just whether it's part of the curriculum 

41.24 48.23 B: part of the curriculum yeah because that would be the only way they would have any kind of say over it you know if a kid was reading it for 

42.13 43.22 A: (( okay yeah )) 

48.40 55.52 B: you know pub- for his own own enjoyment or you know it wasn't assigned and that's not anything to do with them what about you 

51.23 52.63 A: mhm 

54.52 58.22 A: yeah ah i agree with you i think um 

59.25 63.23 A: well i i guess it's hard it's hard to say i don't think 

63.93 67.19 A: cer- certainly they shouldn't be allowed to 

67.33 73.90 A: try to forbid you know okay you know none of the students are allowed to read this book at all on the other hand since they're cho- i 

69.40 71.35 B: yeah yeah 

73.93 75.77 A: i think practically 

75.91 76.92 A: it's 

77.84 88.25 A: [sigh] a- as far as the curriculum goes it sort of seems like at that point they do have a fair amount of control whether you want them to or not because some you know they they can't have students 

88.33 91.91 A: studying every book so they have to choose and if they decide they 

90.75 91.95 B: right 

92.14 97.31 A: don't want one of them to be part of their curriculum then i guess that's their right but um 

97.39 98.69 A: what about 

98.76 104.55 A: um including or not certain books in like in a school library 

104.41 106.87 B: no oh god um 

107.78 108.42 B: (( ah )) 

108.83 109.73 B: (( it )) 

109.89 111.35 B: that's so hard because 

111.66 117.41 B: i think i think they should all be there but then that also comes down to budgets and so 

113.55 114.41 A: mhm 

114.52 116.96 A: yeah 

117.42 118.97 B: (( but i think if we just )) 

117.49 122.74 A: um i'm sorry we just didn't have money to buy huckleberry finn [laughter] 

119.56 129.50 B: yeah yeah i mean that's true and they're they come up with any reason they want and maybe it's easier to buy less i mean harry potter for christ's sake you know 

123.54 124.40 A: (( [cough] mhm )) 

128.59 129.66 A: (( right )) 

129.82 136.06 B: is being said that's all satanical and um so i don't know i mean i don't 

132.19 134.30 A: right right 

136.12 137.48 B: that's um 

137.53 139.42 B: that's a whole other thing i think 

140.60 145.02 B: as far as these women that get together and ban books that's not helping anybody 

144.65 148.44 A: no [laughter] it's yeah um 

145.52 147.14 B: [laughter] so i really 

147.41 150.15 B: but i don't have a solution either because you know 

150.40 154.21 B: there's other book i don't oh man cookbook probably shouldn't be in there 

153.89 156.06 A: yeah probably not but 

155.04 158.65 B: because that's you know how to make bombs kind of books 

156.25 157.34 A: it's 

158.36 160.16 A: yeah um 

161.19 163.81 A: it's just it's hard to say i feel like 

163.94 167.06 A: i feel like schools have a responsibility to 

167.59 172.48 A: expose students to a lot of different viewpoints and topics 

172.55 178.91 B: especially if they're in like an area where there aren't a lot of public schools or public um libraries 

172.69 173.61 A: um 

176.95 178.02 A: mhm 

178.22 180.18 A: yeah yeah exactly 

179.09 186.13 B: that's the problem with these little tiny towns is that you know it's fine if they want to ban it from your school library you can go somewhere else but if that's all you have 

185.52 189.23 A: yeah yeah um 

186.45 187.82 B: that's really sad 

190.84 192.42 A: how their topics 

191.46 194.42 B: what do you think about different um different age levels 

194.78 196.38 A: (( um i think )) 

197.56 200.13 A: i think there is 

201.08 202.45 A: some 

203.31 207.82 A: some difference in what's appropriate for different age levels um 

209.40 210.72 A: but 

212.37 213.77 A: [sigh] i don't 

212.79 222.73 B: everything's like like in high school if someone's you know for seniors in high school that they should have to get permission from their for reading like a book about the holocaust or something that's disturbing or murder 

221.46 224.31 A: i don't think so i mean i think at that age 

224.68 228.30 A: you know you're pretty much an adult and if you're interested in that 

228.58 229.61 A: then you're 

230.31 232.76 A: probably prepared to deal with it i mean 

233.58 236.16 A: i i i think also it might be 

236.94 248.07 A: i- to some extent self regulating you know if you've got an elementary school kid in an elementary school library if there's some really you know big dense book about the holocaust in there that's probably not what the child is going to choose 

238.86 240.04 B: yeah 

247.39 249.36 B: [laughter] 

248.38 249.52 A: so 

249.55 250.75 A: um 

250.40 254.57 B: i can remember we had a a unit on it in sixth grade that was real sketchy 

253.01 253.85 A: uh-huh 

254.60 261.90 B: that mi- that it that we like we all had to get letters signed and it was kind of something that that was real controversial 

255.21 256.46 A: sketchy how so 

258.32 259.54 A: oh really 

261.37 262.36 A: huh 

262.41 267.15 B: and uh that's the only thing that i can remember that was ever and that was in dallas um 

266.45 271.47 A: yeah i don't i i i don't ever really remember having 

271.49 276.74 A: issues like that come up i mean i went to a pretty liberal high school and we were in seattle um 

275.81 276.74 B: mhm 

277.20 281.16 A: and like we we did a unit on the holocaust and and we read 

281.09 286.18 A: articles and saw a lot of movies that were fairly not like gory graphics 

283.17 284.09 B: yeah 

285.53 286.85 B: graphic yeah uh-huh 

286.12 290.58 A: but you know detailing all of the all of the things that went on and i remember 

290.49 298.33 A: some kids would would decide that it was really more than more than they could handle and they would ask to be 

295.38 297.34 B: right right and leave 

298.25 305.76 A: excused and the teacher was fine with that um but for everybody else i don't i don't remember having permission slips or anything like that 

306.10 307.08 A: (( um )) 

306.95 309.64 B: yeah you didn't live in the bible belt [laughter] 

308.74 310.81 A: [laughter] 

309.76 311.39 B: so bad 

311.05 312.75 A: yeah it's 

312.08 323.87 B: like they want to make sure that you know cover themselves anyway they can and then and dallas in like if you get into some of the smaller towns out here in the country where people just don't want to think for themselves and 

315.61 316.88 A: yeah 

323.21 324.30 A: mhm 

323.91 327.95 B: and they think everything needs to be regulated by the church it gets a little bit 

328.15 329.11 B: past 

329.39 338.90 A: yeah what do you think about censorship of like school newspapers and stuff if the if the students write articles that the administration decides they don't want in the paper 

338.62 343.39 B: i don't think there should be any censorship at all um even in my high school we had prior review 

343.27 344.06 A: uh-huh 

343.29 357.00 B: i was the editor of the newspaper and we pretty much could write anything we wanted i mean i wrote a story about about the star football players stealing a bunch of stuff the school that they didn't really want in there kind of negative publicity for the school but it still went in 

347.30 348.37 A: mhm 

353.57 354.52 A: mhm 

354.94 356.34 A: right 

356.91 357.74 A: uh-huh 

357.16 363.02 B: and that was with prior review um so i don't know it's in theory or in practice i mean in theory 

358.95 359.81 A: uh-huh 

363.24 368.80 B: it's not so bad but if they actually do censor it that really irritates me 

368.51 369.56 A: mhm 

368.91 370.02 B: what do you think 

369.93 372.56 A: yeah i i agree with you i mean just to play 

372.64 385.97 A: devil's advocate for a moment um don't you think the school has a right to you know if the if the school paper's going out with the school name on it don't you think they have a right to determine what goes in it 

373.55 374.47 B: mhm 

382.61 383.73 B: yeah 

386.04 391.71 B: i don't know to a to an extent um sure the reporters are representatives of the 

391.84 396.72 B: of the school but if i mean so is the drill team and they don't tell the drill team what to wear and what to 

396.93 404.53 B: what they can or cannot do we had a bunch of drill team you know members get in trouble well i guess they probably have a code too but i just don't even know that 

400.80 402.43 A: [laughter] 

403.78 404.72 A: mhm 

404.78 409.77 B: you know i think everybody's in a representative but you can only extend so much control of what 

409.78 412.11 B: limits your free speech and 

411.23 412.14 A: mhm 

412.25 413.38 A: it als- 

412.31 415.86 B: i think if you have a responsible advisor that's the main thing 

414.66 420.39 A: yeah yeah i- i i do agree with you i mean also since it seems like so many of the 

418.17 419.24 B: yeah 

420.45 427.55 A: kids who work on school papers are doing it because they're interested in it and they're likely to go onto journalism where you know at least ideally the 

427.68 431.88 A: purpose is to you know go out and seek the truth and report it to 

430.72 437.13 B: mhm mm well now they're they're censoring real journalism anyway and saying that we can't in the name of the national security and 

434.00 434.89 A: well 

436.47 437.74 A: yeah 

437.75 442.20 B: that's great that yeah i could talk forever on that topic [laughter] 

439.94 442.86 A: [laughter] 

442.36 444.70 B: it's not fit for the american public 

444.54 450.23 A: what what do you think about some of the um management of media that's been going on lately 

444.74 445.58 B: but ah 

449.89 454.19 B: with the corporatization and there's like i think there's nine 

454.49 458.03 B: big companies that own eighty percent of the media now 

457.92 458.94 A: (( really )) 

458.36 463.90 B: it's ridiculous um well i mean i'm a journalism major at u._t. so um 

462.25 463.05 A: okay 

464.17 474.37 B: that's we've been talking about it a lot in one of my classes but it's leading to fewer and fewer s- well i mean the internet has obviously a ton more sources than there ever existed before it 

466.69 467.63 A: mhm 

474.39 478.92 B: but there's fewer mainstream areas 

474.40 475.54 A: mhm 

479.28 480.64 A: yeah 

480.63 484.15 B: all the smaller papers are getting bought out the bigger 

484.24 487.11 B: there's about nine cities that still have two 

487.16 492.17 B: two papers and that's really rare because it's they can't compete 

488.61 489.60 A: mhm 

492.30 500.29 A: yeah well it's it's kind of ironic in in seattle we have two papers but i get the feeling they're kind of run by the same major company 

499.63 504.15 B: mhm you should look it up i mean you can find that you can totally find that out 

500.90 502.18 A: so 

503.44 511.89 A: it's because it's just it's i mean i probably could but it's just odd like when you when you set up subscriptions and stuff the number you call is subscriptions for both papers and 

511.79 512.66 B: huh 

512.16 513.57 A: um and the 

512.70 515.85 B: i bet one of them bought the other one out and is like it exists 

515.41 520.41 A: yeah it's just i i almost don't see the point [laughter] um 

518.29 519.30 B: yeah 

520.29 532.90 B: oh yeah that's why there's there's so few towns that have it i mean it was it used to be good because you you knew you were getting in the best news because both of them were competing against each other to kind of put the freshest newest greatest whatever breaking story 

530.01 531.37 A: right 

532.53 533.51 A: mhm 

533.42 540.47 B: but it's too easy when it's when you're the only paper in town to just be complacent with whatever gets and so 

533.83 534.75 A: [noise] 

539.07 540.11 A: yeah 

540.52 542.43 B: it's been eight minutes good god 

542.04 544.80 A: [laughter] 

542.56 544.18 B: [laughter] 

544.21 545.52 B: (( i'm so glad )) 

545.54 551.99 A: do you think they're that it's yeah do you think that it's possible to still get unbiased news 

546.43 547.72 B: like i'm rambling 

552.21 556.71 B: oh we talk about that too but the whole w- the whole objective 

556.78 562.03 B: concept is just a theory that it's it's a um what is it called it's a um 

562.62 565.28 B: like a goal an unobtainable goal 

563.59 565.60 A: mhm okay 

565.35 578.36 B: you know where you want to always strive for it but you know you can never achieve it so i don't think that you can get unbiased news but if you're aware if you know that those companies that the companies are owned by each other at least you know that much and you're going into it 

571.75 572.89 A: mhm 

578.59 585.88 B: you know with a with an open eye to everything you know if you know that that company owns that company and that one owns that company 

581.01 582.29 A: mhm 

585.89 586.95 A: yeah 

586.47 591.97 B: and maybe you can second guess what they're saying and look for other sources i don't know what do you think 

589.66 590.48 A: uh-huh 

592.29 598.39 A: it's it's hard to say i mean we have we have two big papers here and then a couple of smaller 

598.49 599.89 A: papers which is as far
