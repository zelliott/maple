2.66 3.47 B: (( [noise] )) 

4.64 5.76 B: hello 

5.55 6.73 A: yes 

6.30 8.20 B: oh hi my name is lisa 

7.98 8.97 A: hi 

8.79 9.96 B: hi 

10.66 12.45 A: what are we supposed to do [laughter] 

12.31 16.07 B: um we are supposed to talk about i think they said 

16.22 17.93 B: whether um 

17.93 20.36 A: [noise] about private schools can 

19.12 23.04 B: whether sc- school can require children to read certain books 

22.58 23.80 A: right 

23.34 24.39 B: right 

23.95 26.50 A: if they can censor them is that what it was 

26.76 30.57 B: oh i thought it was whether they can require them to read certain ones 

30.21 32.35 A: oh we can do both [laughter] 

31.74 37.35 B: okay [laughter] that sounds good to me what do you think 

33.10 34.54 A: [laughter] 

36.03 37.00 A: um 

37.78 41.93 A: i mean i think required reading is a good way to get them to read 

41.50 42.76 B: mhm 

42.13 44.11 A: you know and as long as it's 

45.13 52.78 A: you know an- as long as they're just like the classics or just you know things that are going to further their education i don't have any kind of problem with that however 

52.92 61.04 A: um censoring i don't think that they have the right to do that i think that you know if we've got freedom of speech they should have freedom to read whatever's been written 

61.68 65.60 B: i agree i agree um i think that um 

62.48 63.36 A: [laughter] 

65.93 69.16 B: it ties into you know the whole 

69.55 72.55 B: separating the church and the state and um 

70.79 72.38 A: (( [noise] exactly )) 

73.08 84.82 B: you know even if it's a private school i think you just have to have faith in the educational system that you've elected for your children to be a part of and 

85.09 91.76 B: sort of trust those educators that they are picking material that's educational and informative um 

92.19 94.46 B: you know because they're because some people go 

94.70 97.73 B: uh just real far with the censorship stuff 

97.10 98.21 A: i agree 

98.00 102.56 B: so [laughter] okay so we agree on that [laughter] 

98.82 100.58 A: [laughter] 

101.23 104.28 A: yeah no i'm not one to censor anything so 

104.45 108.25 A: um i think they gave us like ten minutes to talk about this so i don't know 

108.06 109.70 B: i know no i to- 

108.29 110.19 A: what else there is to talk about 

110.35 117.91 B: no i totally agree i um and i believe in in you know freedom of speech and i think you're right it ties into that and um 

117.80 120.59 A: yeah i don't believe in any of the book burnings or 

120.76 131.63 A: you know and they feel like tom sawyer is you know not good or whatever it's you know what w- everyone has rea- you know it's all been read in the past and the kids are exposed to so much more these days 

131.84 137.03 A: that you know what they're going to find in some of these books is not going to [laughter] be the worst of it 

135.63 142.96 B: oh absolut- oh absolutely oh my gosh that's so true i mean they are exposed to so much more so much younger and some 

143.04 146.51 B: places i think um censor harry potter 

146.65 148.62 A: yeah that's that actually 

148.64 152.41 A: i um have a teacher friend who [sigh] 

152.62 153.49 A: (( ah )) 

153.56 159.41 A: one of the pare- she was reading it to the class and one of the parents had a problem with it because 

159.45 160.99 A: of some of the 

161.74 169.82 A: some of the things you know the wizardry yeah and i was like give me a break you know these kids are just reading it for enjoyment they're not going to you know 

161.86 163.12 B: imagery

183.36 184.68 B: well um 

185.97 192.42 B: you know it's it's interesting because having said all that i do i have a thirteen year old and an eleven year old and um 

191.54 193.49 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

192.79 197.79 B: my thirteen is at an age they both have always liked to read but my thirteen year old's at an age 

198.12 208.00 B: being thirteen being you know pre adolescent where he just you know has his own little set of ideas and reading is not cool right now 

204.16 205.16 A: right 

207.77 210.61 A: oh but he'll still read harry potter 

208.08 209.88 B: but but yet harry 

210.37 213.14 B: well but that's the only thing that he'll read 

212.55 215.51 A: right so you're not going to discourage that because he's reading 

215.19 222.01 B: no not at all i mean i wouldn't discourage it anyway but you know what if what if it hadn't been allowed or you know 

216.72 217.78 A: right 

220.80 223.32 A: exactly exactly 

222.12 223.15 B: um 

223.39 224.33 B: um 

224.45 226.78 B: but i will say um 

225.66 226.35 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

226.82 227.76 B: there's 

228.00 237.83 B: that that i feel like i should have some control over what my kids read um in fact this past weekend my daughter's been library and she wanted to read the lovely bones 

237.63 239.19 A: (( oh no i don't know that )) 

238.56 240.73 B: and that's an adult book 

240.14 242.83 A: oh but it was in the library 

240.87 242.05 B: (( that's ah um )) 

243.09 245.86 B: yeah well no not the school library 

243.99 245.44 A: was it in the school 

245.49 246.99 A: not the school library 

246.48 249.15 B: no this was actually a public library 

247.05 250.37 A: oh okay well yeah that i agree i mean 

249.67 251.15 B: yeah 

250.56 258.79 A: you know in fifth grade i i remember you know we were all like oh let's read that forever book by judy bloom you know because it had like 

257.57 258.68 B: yeah 

258.65 265.89 A: it talked about sex and what not and you know that w- i think that was in the school library and i was in fifth grade now that you know 

263.38 264.58 B: right 

266.18 270.84 A: but you know what if you're curious and it's like you better you kind of want them to know 

270.87 276.45 A: rather than ah stumble upon you know you i don't know or you'd rather them ask you i guess 

276.57 278.01 B: yeah 

277.33 279.51 A: any questions like that but 

278.94 280.96 B: but sometimes um 

280.81 293.13 A: but yeah i believe parents do have the right to say you know what you're not old enough yet but not say you know i don't think that they should say yes but this is bad because it's going to you know it's wizardry and it's you know they're going to the devil or whatever it is 

282.82 283.39 B: (( [cough] )) 

292.54 294.67 B: right right 

293.67 297.69 A: and that i don't agree with but i i mean yes every parent's got the right to 

297.89 298.78 A: (( you know )) 

299.12 301.70 A: rule over their children until they're eighteen 

299.24 300.65 B: choose on their own 

301.73 302.83 B: right 

302.93 306.71 B: yeah no i i so agree and and honestly 

303.18 303.98 A: so 

307.13 314.12 B: just just about i mean with exceptions on adult topics for certain kids who just aren't ready to handle it 

313.92 314.96 A: right 

314.10 325.18 B: you know anytime you can get a child to read anything it's just and especially if if you know you read it with them like i'm sure you're doing right now with your one year old i mean but that just continues 

322.36 324.21 A: right 

325.51 338.82 B: it opens up an avenue for discussion you know if you if you read it together or even if you don't read it together if you kind of know what's going on in the book and it brings up things that they'll talk to you about um 

328.81 330.09 A: exactly 

335.06 336.19 A: mhm 

337.38 338.43 A: right 

338.81 345.42 B: it doesn't really matter to me what level it's at because i'd rather them hear anything and everything from me first 

344.82 345.87 A: right 

345.65 353.68 B: you know and if there is a topic in a book that you know i may be uncomfortable with i'd still rather they bring it up with me 

349.00 349.78 A: (( hm )) 

353.00 354.19 A: exactly 

353.76 355.79 B: than anybody else so 

355.08 356.70 A: exactly 

356.48 360.24 B: um anyway [laughter] 

357.99 358.94 A: yeah 

359.08 364.53 A: so now does someone like read this someone listen to our conversation and then use that to 

363.47 367.18 B: i don't know i have no idea this is the first one i've done 

364.64 365.55 A: [laughter]

367.32 368.38 B: have you done 

368.53 373.37 B: yeah yeah and did you find out for it a while ago 

368.60 370.38 A: this is the first one i've done 

372.94 379.61 A: yes and i it was funny i was just thinking gosh you know i never got anything about that i never got a call 

377.71 379.14 B: right 

379.57 385.68 B: no ah because i remember i signed up for it um during my kids' spring break which was actually like a month ago 

385.61 386.95 A: yeah 

386.34 391.91 B: and um and i thought well i guess i just missed it [laughter] but um

407.49 408.58 B: um 

409.03 412.80 B: i wonder if they try to match people from different 

413.36 414.89 A: well when i i 

413.53 414.60 B: areas of 

415.03 421.99 A: you know they asked me a bunch of questions and i punched in and they said let's find another participant so maybe or that was just what kind of phone am i on 

421.52 425.32 B: [mn] yeah yeah i had that too but um 

424.21 425.23 A: so

436.63 438.67 B: well i live in texas 

438.22 439.35 A: (( so do i )) 

439.10 440.21 B: you do 

439.80 440.63 A: (( mhm )) 

440.52 444.86 B: well i bet that um this is more of an issue in texas [laughter] 

444.36 446.39 A: oh you're right where are you 

446.17 447.56 B: i'm in dallas 

447.00 448.71 A: (( oh so am i in )) 

448.65 453.91 B: oh you are okay well i'm i'm in university park 

449.39 450.53 A: yeah 

453.32 454.82 A: okay [laughter] 

454.33 458.26 B: well that's interesting i would have thought that they might have gotten people from 

455.82 457.34 A: it is interesting 

458.43 460.84 B: different parts of the country because 

462.15 465.47 B: you know there there might be some discrepancy 

462.82 463.96 A: mhm 

464.38 475.21 A: yeah i mean i can understand that here you know just being in the midst of the bible belt and and now it's definitely a bigger issue probably here than like up north where they're just you know it's more liberal 

468.33 470.80 B: right absolutely 

475.02 476.91 B: right right 

475.97 476.93 A: um 

477.27 483.19 A: you know as the as the general thing you know i feel like i'm kind of liberal but you know i'm sure that i'm 

483.20 485.35 A: probably in the minority here for that 

485.39 486.43 B: well 

487.33 497.51 B: i think when it comes to people's rights i'm definitely more on the liberal side too and [laughter] and you know what this this definitely is the bible belt and we had 

492.85 494.18 A: right so you're 

497.82 500.29 B: people that our elementary school 

500.57 506.89 B: we had to stop calling it halloween parties we had had to call it like fall parties because 

503.15 504.48 A: oh [sigh] 

506.33 510.25 A: well the schools don't even allow them to celebrate halloween 

510.49 511.91 B: isn't that silly 

511.50 521.18 A: it's so si- i mean it's you know it's taking away all the the freedom and the fun you know it's just the kids aren't the no all hallow's eve who cares they're just going to dress up and get some candy 

520.95 528.42 B: yeah it's totally blown out of proportion and it's just an extension of the book thing and um 

521.38 522.72 A: i think it's 

523.78 524.86 A: i agree 

524.98 525.71 A: i 

528.98 531.57 B: you know i'm one of those little rebels who 

531.39 532.91 B: quite honestly if they 

532.73 536.04 B: (( censored a book i'd probably just go out and buy it it would make me )) 

534.25 535.23 A: (( yeah )) 

535.87 548.18 B: [laughter] just like my teenager it would make me want to go out and buy it and read it and say well what is it in here that you know they don't want me to see [laughter] so anyway 

539.28 541.86 A: exactly exactly 

544.19 546.04 A: [laughter] 

547.06 549.48 A: are your kids in private school here 

549.25 552.00 B: no uh-uh we're in the public schools

556.97 558.35 A: yeah 

559.78 561.29 B: i remember 

561.76 566.75 B: at our at again at elementary school level our ah librarian who has since retired 

566.86 572.32 B: um there was a series of books called the bailey school kids and the- it was kind of like 

572.53 586.11 B: [mn] werewolf don't like something and i i mean it was kind of like a little bit scary and my son just loved them i mean they're like mysteries and you could he'd sit down little paperbacks and read them cover to cover it'd take him about an hour 

576.91 577.52 A: (( [mn] )) 

581.03 582.22 A: right 

586.14 592.83 B: and this is in like second grade and so after we were done i mean you know he was done i took him to the library to donate them and 

592.90 596.94 B: (( she's like oh i don't know if we should have these here and i thought oh )) 

594.66 595.72 A: [mn]
