0.73 1.81 B: hi 

1.92 4.43 A: hi uh this is costas 

4.33 5.60 B: i'm jesse 

5.63 7.18 A: (( jesse how you doing )) 

6.57 8.21 B: good how you doing 

8.03 11.38 A: oh pretty good so uh censorship 

11.58 12.72 A: um 

13.45 17.39 A: whether or not um schools should ah what is it allow or 

17.50 20.70 A: bar students from reading certain books is that what it was 

21.24 24.06 B: [mn] like forcing students to read certain books 

23.88 25.43 A: oh forcing them okay 

25.72 28.51 A: (( ah well um )) 

28.55 31.10 A: (( i think generally ah [mn] )) 

31.83 41.02 A: you know um i think parents probably have the right to to be involved in the decision but ah you know i think generally students are ah 

41.33 43.52 A: in school to be exposed to ah 

43.59 45.71 A: you know a range of different ah 

45.91 47.97 A: (( ideas so you know )) 

48.89 55.33 A: um my feeling is they should be exposed to as much stuff as possible and kind of you know let them decide 

54.91 57.78 B: it should be dependent on the community standards 

58.03 62.16 B: like what's considered uh inappropriate 

58.17 58.77 A: (( mhm )) 

61.63 62.70 A: right 

62.90 66.48 B: like you know the definition of obscene is 

66.65 69.21 B: up to the community to set up [noise] 

71.26 73.18 A: yeah there's uh 

73.97 76.69 A: that's definitely a factor but um 

77.11 81.16 A: you know i guess it's always you know where do you draw the line it's kind of 

81.40 88.32 A: um you know there's a lot of things that that are pretty obviously obscene i think in in most communities but uh 

88.38 90.44 A: (( you know when you get to uh )) 

90.45 93.31 A: borrow certain books like say huck finn or 

93.54 97.82 A: uh catcher in the rye might be objectionable or obscene and you know 

98.96 101.13 A: how do you decide ah 

101.73 102.66 A: (( i don't know )) 

105.23 113.48 A: you don't have that there's you know it's pretty easy to point out certain things that you probably would never find in a school anyway that would be obscene 

106.14 106.98 B: yeah 

113.53 116.70 A: but it's always ah it comes down to the ah 

117.06 117.98 A: um 

118.04 121.01 A: it comes down to the the grey areas i guess 

120.81 122.45 B: yeah 

122.42 123.07 A: [noise] 

123.27 124.33 A: um 

126.35 127.71 A: well let's see 

128.18 133.59 B: so what are you saying it's unconstitutional to force people to read certain books or 

134.45 136.23 A: unconstitutional um 

137.01 139.74 A: (( well yeah i'm not sure )) 

140.91 144.04 A: force them to read certain books but um 

144.02 156.92 A: how how you define force i mean i guess if it's if a student has to read this book or else he doesn't get the grade or he can't get credit for that class then yeah i guess that's forcing him to do it um 

156.80 169.53 A: on the other hand though you gotta you know how do you keep a curriculum i mean you can't have students and their parents just kind of picking and choosing which what parts of the you know the curriculum they want to do what part they don't you know 

169.24 170.91 B: mhm 

170.27 171.31 A: um 

171.39 178.85 B: but generally if it's not too offensive then i don't think parents would object to it but if it's 

178.98 184.21 B: blatantly you know inappropriate like 

183.51 185.40 A: (( mhm )) 

184.48 188.10 B: maybe harry potter some people might say that's objectionable 

187.90 190.33 A: yeah i've heard that a lot um 

188.34 189.91 B: magic and sorcery 

190.38 194.54 A: (( you know i mean yeah i've heard that a lot from some people who just consider it's you know it's it's )) 

194.81 206.36 A: um elements i i i've got to admit i've never read it myself i have friends who who have and their kids who love it but you know they say there's elements of um you know non-christian uh 

206.88 207.83 A: uh 

208.63 209.74 A: (( values )) 

210.92 213.03 A: having your kids be exposed to 

214.78 217.07 A: (( um it's um )) 

217.17 224.31 A: you know that's where the grey area comes in i mean what what do you say i guess you can try to filter stuff that's just completely non- 

225.16 230.49 A: just completely non-offensive but how many you know how much of that stuff can you 

231.78 234.18 A: can you find 

234.38 238.18 A: and you know when the kids get to you just start to 

238.49 241.30 A: (( get into adva- more advanced material and )) 

242.20 245.82 A: i think basically you you can't please everybody all the time you know 

248.41 251.98 B: it also depends on the topic of the book i guess 

252.05 253.51 B: like if you're 

253.82 263.12 B: reading like kama sutra to like fifth graders i mean that's inappropriate but well that's extreme but you know what i'm saying 

258.93 260.82 A: well yeah 

263.00 265.17 A: yeah yeah i do um 

266.09 270.28 A: common sense ah whi- which i know is kind of a a minefield 

270.97 272.29 A: put it that way 

272.45 275.28 A: but i think generally common sense 

275.73 281.36 A: ah can take care of a lot of that ah you know you're not supposed to ah 

281.49 296.06 A: ah expose ah kids to to you know certain things like that ah not at an early age maybe never and not specifically the books but i guess this comes into play with like sex sex education it's kind of 

295.57 296.85 B: yeah 

296.22 298.90 A: you know the same thing there um 

298.78 300.89 B: i think it should be left up 

299.70 300.85 A: some people 

301.32 314.47 B: to their community i mean if you live in a certain community then the chances are you have similar values and if you happen to have differing values then you should have options available like you're a vegetarian 

315.13 317.07 A: (( right )) 

317.49 319.11 A: yeah i think uh 

320.28 323.07 A: (( i think you've got a point there you've got a good point there um )) 

323.41 331.70 A: ah i guess it makes more work for the ah ah you know school administrators and teachers and that's that's probably how it should be ah you know but 

331.86 334.67 A: ah try to accommodate everybody 

335.02 342.57 A: ah or at least the ah you know whatever's prevailing in that in that certain community ah maybe the only thing you have to consider is that ah ah in 

342.77 346.32 A: a lot of cases the kids will um 

346.42 354.85 A: grow up and you know good chance they'll go move to those other parts of the world other parts of the country and and maybe consider that as far as 

355.44 356.45 A: (( um )) 

356.63 363.29 A: you know taking into account community standards but from there kind of maybe expand the scope a little bit 

368.72 371.35 B: and you also have to consider like 

369.04 369.91 A: (( ah )) 

371.57 382.42 B: being in a very closed christian community that's very conservative and let's say you go to college in los angeles or something and it's like a culture shock 

380.73 381.41 A: (( yes )) 

382.61 385.24 A: oh god i'm sure a lot of people ah 

385.35 390.76 A: a lot of kids ah you know go through that right about that age um you 

390.92 398.39 A: live in a small town all your life and all of a sudden you ah you go to you know three thousand miles away and uh hello you know 

399.51 400.53 A: um 

401.63 403.94 A: that's why i mean i lean 

404.19 408.72 A: my my own personal view is is i really lean toward as little 

408.77 411.25 A: um restrictions as possible 

411.33 421.94 A: ah for myself i mean that would be my preference uh you know find out all you can about everything and uh dispel the mystery from there and you know 

422.08 423.07 A: um 

424.10 429.59 A: [mn] i'm i'm not sure how i guess part of it is because i'm not sure how effective it is to kind of uh 

430.25 440.13 A: restrict or keep anything from uh from anyone a kid or anything else i mean the thing about this too i mean they don't learn about it in school i mean 

440.23 442.80 A: ah the internet now um 

443.12 446.74 A: [mn] other things i mean it's it's it's hard to really um 

447.53 450.76 A: [mn] keep someone from being aware of uh things like that if 

451.28 455.47 A: if they really want to be exposed to it 

455.72 459.50 A: um at least at school where there's kind of a framework there that um 

459.73 460.57 A: uh 

460.94 462.14 A: that uh 

462.35 463.60 A: (( you know ah )) 

463.69 467.30 A: they're kind of um introduced to it in a structured way 

467.25 468.56 B: mhm 

469.12 469.81 A: (( so )) 

470.08 478.33 A: um did you ever run into that like in when you were going school like some book came up that some parents objected to or anything like that 

477.60 479.76 B: not really 

479.88 481.76 B: i mean i'm from l._a. so 

481.82 483.21 A: right yeah i'm from 

482.23 483.36 B: not much 

483.85 486.25 A: new york [laughter] so we didn't really 

484.86 485.75 B: [laughter] 

486.65 487.60 A: uh 

488.23 492.91 A: i i know that i don't remember anything like that and i know a lot of the books that we read ah 

493.18 499.07 A: ah like a separate peace or catcher in the rye they were uh back then were um 

499.79 502.40 A: we knew we i guess i was aware at that time that in 

502.53 506.15 A: ah some other parts of the country these were the kind of things that ah 

506.83 511.89 A: people were touchy about but you know it it wasn't an issue where i was 

508.41 510.04 B: mhm 

512.58 526.25 B: and it also depends on the time i mean the awakening was like really controversial i mean feminism she c- commits suicide at the end she leaves her husband and people were like wow what the heck is this 

527.11 528.21 A: yeah 

527.61 531.19 B: but a hundred years later it's totally okay [cough] 

531.48 533.11 A: yeah that's true there's 

533.99 540.33 A: a you know the mores change um especially over you know long periods of time but even 

540.86 543.87 A: you know ten twenty years later ah things 

544.32 550.67 A: [noise] things tend to be uh uh people tend to have a different attitude toward uh uh toward some things 

551.12 552.73 A: uh so 

555.24 561.23 A: (( yeah i don't know i mean it sounds like we're sort of of a like mind i guess on this )) 

562.07 562.77 A: (( uh )) 

565.03 566.36 A: the uh 

568.13 568.69 A: (( [mn] )) 

571.20 573.79 A: i'm not sure what else to add to it ah 

574.38 581.80 A: you know ah i'm trying to think of like a real solid situation where uh where it wouldn't be a good idea to um 

581.79 590.70 A: or you know where you know banning certain books would be a good idea but i'm not i'm not really think- i'm not really coming up with thinking 

592.23 593.17 A: (( ah )) 

593.46 597.29 A: you see things in the news every once in a while you know relating to this 

595.84 596.73 B: yeah
