0.63 2.29 B: hey i'm lars 

2.06 3.61 A: hi this is neil 

3.57 4.94 B: (( hey neil how's it going )) 

4.90 6.47 A: doing good uh where you from 

6.51 8.02 B: uh seattle you 

8.53 12.40 A: oh from uh texas but i'm actually in california i'm just going to school in texas 

12.29 13.46 B: oh cool 

13.62 19.62 B: so uh the topic of conversation is uh censorship in schools what do you think 

19.17 27.09 A: uh i think things should be censored but i mean but like they're selling books now that certainly should not be allowed to be read in class i mean i i agree with that 

27.09 29.11 B: like uh what sort of books 

29.49 41.73 A: i mean like if there's a s- say like there's a total anti-black book out there you know or or a racially stereotype book and i i i mean obviously you can't read it in class 'cause then all the african american citizens would be offended by it 

41.75 43.88 B: mhm what um 

42.05 43.32 A: so but i 

44.17 48.39 B: do you think there's some value in reading books like that like for example 

48.47 57.81 B: um you know one thing that i could see it being positive is that uh it could make people aware of just how 

57.94 72.19 B: racist other people can be right so you know being i'm trying to think of some some things that i've read in the past where you know if you read someone who has like a really messed up point of view it makes you realize like um 

69.49 70.47 A: mhm 

71.01 74.07 A: yeah how people are because they're in the world 

74.06 84.45 B: right exactly how bad how bad people can think and then you know i'm ok- i'm okay with people reading books like that as long as they read it in the right context right you know 

82.46 83.11 A: (( mm )) 

83.05 87.72 A: that's true but i mean but like there's like some books out there like that have no value at all educationally you know 

87.62 94.27 A: and like but like the thing that i'm against is like like huck finn they use the word that they use the n. word in there a few times 

93.39 95.12 B: mhm 

94.11 101.70 A: and so i heard like some schools are thinking of of banning reading huck finn but i mean like huck finn is a classic book that shouldn't that shouldn't be banned just because of a few words because 

101.47 113.10 A: the back in the days i mean that that's how it was you know it develops cultural context of the of the text so banning a book like that would would would offend me like it would bother me but like banning other books probably wouldn't bother me like you 

109.48 110.29 B: (( uh huh )) 

113.14 120.51 A: know like say i i i really like some books how valuable like books to have a view or value i agree with them not being read in class well i mean 

120.83 127.60 A: [lipsmack] it should be up to or it should be left up to the schools to decide 'cause there there might be some schools who are you know has more value than other schools 

127.89 129.57 B: so um 

127.91 130.28 A: just depending on the region of where you are 

130.31 134.65 B: what uh like what do you mean in terms of banning are you 

134.51 146.70 B: are you talking about banning in terms of um school including them in the their curriculum banning in terms of schools not having 'em in the library like um or banning people from like 

145.21 158.31 A: probably not in not probably not including them in the curriculum i'm sure like if you if people are interested in just like researching it then i mean by all means have it in the library but yeah i just think i guess not having in it the curriculum or if if someone was just reading it at school 

158.09 162.55 A: then it's their own free will to read it wherever they want to but i mean let's like not keep it as part of the curriculum 

162.64 165.53 B: yeah good that sounds totally reasonable to me 

165.62 168.73 B: um how about uh let's see 

168.79 174.18 B: uh i don't know are there any other types of books you think should be kept out of uh the school system or 

175.52 188.07 A: well when i went to school mostly all we read was just classics and like a few new books like catch twenty two i guess was like one of the newer books that we read but e- even that was fifty years old so like through my experience because i 

183.72 185.44 B: mhm 

187.88 198.54 A: i'm a sophomore in uh college so uh i i almost just graduated high school a few years ago so i mean there weren't even that really that many charge books i mean the the only i remember is huck finn that that's 'cause it used the n. word in there 

198.41 201.82 B: right right yeah 

198.84 199.77 A: so 

200.27 204.03 A: and i mean every other book i mean most books i read are just classics 

204.11 205.02 B: yeah 

204.47 205.32 A: so 

206.47 212.29 B: so what do you think i just heard uh on the radio the other day that uh somebody wrote a book 

212.16 225.80 B: uh basically claiming that you don't have to pay your income taxes he said like if you actually look at the laws there's no nothing in the constitution and and they just they just put an injunction on that book so it's illegal to sell it and buy it huh 

218.18 219.07 A: yeah 

219.17 220.97 A: i heard about that i heard about that 

226.37 227.93 B: it's pretty mess- 

226.51 235.19 A: i mean uh i think that's the i think it's not so good that they stopped writing um because if it's free i mean even though like have you heard of the anarchist cook book before 

235.18 236.03 B: yeah 

236.12 247.40 A: it's like it's where it teaches you how to make bombs and stuff like if you go to a bookstore you can still buy that book but i st- i don't see why you shouldn't you shouldn't be allowed to buy this book as well just because like it's about the government this time they're they're all getting they're getting upset about it 

240.16 241.08 B: yeah 

243.96 244.97 B: right 

247.60 249.66 B: right i agree i mean 

249.79 253.27 B: i think it's good to have information out there you know 

252.74 253.54 A: (( yeah )) 

253.33 254.39 B: and uh 

254.58 256.72 B: there's the whole thing too about uh 

256.86 260.48 B: the government now requiring that bookstores 

260.52 266.55 B: share their information with the department of homeland security with what books you're buying which i think is really messed up 

260.92 262.68 A: (( yeah i that )) 

265.94 272.01 A: yeah like if like even if you you go to the library and check out a book sometimes like you know like there's some libraries that say like we you know 

271.93 285.06 A: uh we're sorry but we have to comply with this like every you know you might be being watched whatever book you check out i think that's totally messed up because i mean it's up to it's up to someone that they might be used for innocent research and then and they'll probably get tagged because they're reading this book 

285.24 286.85 B: right exactly 

287.41 294.41 B: well well this debates kind of uh [laughter] i think it's just not a lot to talk about 'cause we agree on it [laughter] 

293.11 297.11 A: (( exactly and all it does is you debate 'cause i mean like we agree on most of these things yeah )) 

296.70 300.28 B: yeah so it's kinda hard to so i guess 

298.95 308.40 A: i'm so pretty much against most of this uh national national security stuff 'cause all it is just nonsense that they're just they're just trying to like make you feel secure about it just creates more of a hassle than anything else 

308.51 310.37 B: yeah completely 

308.83 321.88 A: it just it makes you it just makes people think they're safe when actually they're they are not even i mean it's actually less safe because they're they're they're thinking oh there's so much to be able to protect me so i'm not gonna need to keep my my my defenses up and then that could end up getting even more 

319.89 320.97 B: yeah 

321.99 325.74 A: more dangerous because the people aren't really watching around what's going on 

323.37 325.21 B: yeah 

325.77 330.68 B: i totally agree i'm i'm totally think our civil liberties have been completely uh 

331.52 336.33 B: you know attacked for the last twenty years i'm uh like 

336.47 337.85 B: my uh m- 

336.50 338.51 A: especially these last few years 

338.72 343.51 B: yeah i know it's really it's really quite quite quite scary um 

343.58 346.00 B: are you familiar with like the rave act at all 

346.23 347.31 A: no what now 

347.29 355.83 B: [lipsmack] it's called the rave act um sort of been nicknamed it's a it's a law that just got passed last week they've been trying to pass it for two years now 

349.63 350.97 A: mhm 

355.78 367.45 B: and basically what it says is that anyone that throws a social event so that could be like a party a dance an art thing you know whatever it might be anyone that sols- a 

367.47 382.28 B: throws a public event um if they ha- if they could reasonably believe that somebody at the event might be using illegal drugs the person that threw the event is responsible 

380.51 382.97 A: (( mm yes they could be for it )) 

383.03 389.47 B: yeah is responsible for prison time and like up to half a million dollar fine or something which is just ridiculous 'cause 

388.78 395.13 A: yeah the but like doesn't look like the same thing with like napster like napster's just a indexing service and then 

395.01 405.75 A: like people use it to trade music and so they they're going after napster um because of napster that it's happening it's almost like a similar thing you know they're only after the main person instead of attacking the individuals 

405.77 406.68 A: in a way 

405.96 407.64 B: right 

406.81 410.47 A: (( like did you ha- did you happen like i think it was like i think it was like three or four days ago )) 

410.38 422.96 A: some college student they they indexed the college network was the monthly i mean the most college students don't have his music and movies on the computers right so they created like a a program so they could uh search all the computers on the network 

417.48 418.24 B: (( uh huh )) 

422.88 428.99 A: and so what happened was that m._r. m._i._a. sued them for ninety eight billion dollars i 

428.28 429.77 B: you're kidding 

429.39 442.28 A: think every song was a hundred and fifty thousand dollar copyright violation even though a- all they did all they did was make a indexing service that that had nothing to do with music so i mean if you search for the word music you'll get music but all they made was the indexing 

433.41 434.49 B: wow 

442.05 445.16 A: and but they they still got sued for ninety eight billion dollars 

442.53 443.58 B: wow 

445.11 446.75 B: it's ridiculous it seem it 

445.21 446.86 A: (( ridiculous like )) 

447.76 456.05 B: seems like the the uh record industry is really short sighted you know they should have started doing subscription based model years ago and you know they're 

451.84 452.71 A: yeah 

456.95 465.46 B: they're like living with old technology and you know even if i go out and buy a c._d. the first thing i do is rip it to mp3 because it's more convenient to use that way you know 

464.10 472.58 A: exactly yeah like uh i just i just bought the linkin park c._d. but i i couldn't read i i i made a copy of it because i don't want the original to get damaged you know 

465.69 466.60 B: (( um )) 

472.60 474.31 B: right exactly 

472.61 480.83 A: like and like like there's some c._d.s now that have copy like like you can't copy 'em even if you buy it i mean i'm like it's my own property i can do whatever i want with it you know so 

481.05 482.92 A: (( you've got to have some some things )) 

481.06 482.28 B: yeah 

482.90 487.19 B: it's ridiculous you should be able to make a back up copy and stuff like that under uh
