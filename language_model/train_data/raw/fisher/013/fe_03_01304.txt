407.56 408.53 A: mhm 

408.44 416.17 B: uh there are a lot of you know so many problems we have in our country and when i see 

416.12 429.95 B: like things you know that people are throwing food away and all these little things you know you wish you could get you know can close your eye and snap your fingers then all these things can be over there 

430.09 431.04 A: yes 

430.27 439.35 B: so people can use it and that's where i kind of that's that's why i like to travel and see what is the difference 

439.40 450.08 B: between like you know several places and i don't know too many countries but here in the united states i've been going to a few states and i like 

450.13 454.63 B: not only i like traveling but i like driving to travel you know

457.24 458.03 B: no 

458.72 467.68 B: yeah yeah you go in no destination or anything you know where wherever you get and you tired then you stop there

467.39 468.34 A: yes 

467.54 477.93 B: which is a very which is a very good way to do it because in that case not only you go where you wanna go but you see a a lot of other things too 

478.06 479.15 A: mhm 

478.22 486.41 B: that you wouldn't probably like you know there are little towns small towns that you go to and you see like the difference you know 

486.43 495.90 B: the way they live and you wonder you know would i be able to live like that a small town like this or a big town you know like this so and so 

495.86 503.96 B: so you you you kind of compare and see which town is cleaner than the others you know [laughter] things like that 

496.24 497.06 A: yes 

503.54 509.95 A: yes and you say oh gosh i wonder if i could live on a farm or [laughter] i know i wonder if i could live yeah 

507.03 519.00 B: yeah if i well i i so i already know i can't live on a farm because i've been in [laughter] i i don't like it especially when it's raining 

513.18 513.80 A: (( [laughter] )) 

515.34 516.12 A: (( [laughter] )) 

518.83 519.82 A: uh-huh 

519.15 530.24 B: you know and the dirt's gotta become the mud and things like that i kind of i don't like that very much so i already know i tried it before which i know 

530.42 535.97 B: i won't be able to but i i like small town for the quietness 

536.32 551.00 B: but then again you know i don't like it too small either you know you want all the stores around even though you're not you're not gonna use them but you like them around in case when you need them you don't have to travel you know 

545.43 546.45 A: right 

550.78 553.99 B: too many miles away to go 

554.21 557.65 B: to to buy a gallon of milk you know things like that but 

557.57 565.15 A: right and fresno's small enough that you can drive down the street or you can go to a restaurant and you'll always run into people you know 

563.40 564.25 B: (( yeah )) 

565.01 566.19 B: (( yeah that's )) 

565.19 566.53 A: and that's nice 

566.27 577.37 B: yeah we this is california is one of the states that are on our agenda like my wife and i for us to visit sometime but since it's so big 

577.46 583.77 B: and we kind of had ideas of so many big you know cities they have i 

583.76 584.79 A: yes 

583.99 593.18 B: i think you know when we go there we should be able to have like a couple of days you know to go around and 

593.17 599.96 B: we don't know how far away the cities are from each other but at least we know it's a very large state
