28.57 35.35 B: p- uh this is my second call i was i was wondering if i was going to get a second call because it's been probably three weeks 

32.93 34.12 A: right 

35.01 36.84 A: right right same here 

35.63 43.18 B: since the first call yeah yeah i'm now i i yeah i didn't understand the topic i i 

37.34 38.74 A: yeah same here 

38.81 40.55 A: so what do we have to talk about 

42.15 48.19 A: i think we have to talk about uh if sch- first it was about censorship i think and then they said um 

48.27 57.57 A: well within this topic i had real time getting at odds with if the schools should allow or disallow certain books for students to read is that what you heard 

56.23 59.78 B: oh right yeah yeah something about that 

58.22 66.08 A: right right okay at least [laughter] because i wasn't sure either it was so fast and so mechanical that i thought my god what did he say 

60.47 61.42 B: yeah 

65.89 74.63 B: yeah that's a very strange topic too because i don't really know you know i've never really thought about um you know censorship in books and schools 

74.00 78.31 A: yeah that doesn't really matter because we can just say whatever we feel about it 

75.56 76.58 B: yeah 

78.12 85.09 B: yeah so um that's fine yeah um well i don't know do you wanna start or do you want me to start 

78.66 79.57 A: right 

84.79 92.64 A: well i don't care well i can start if you want to well i really don't i absolutely do not believe in censorship see i am german and i 

87.55 88.73 B: (( yeah that's fine )) 

92.88 99.99 A: uh still remember times when you know my parents telling me what happened during certain times in germany like the third reich 

99.97 100.95 B: mhm 

100.31 112.71 A: when everything was censored and books were burned and i'm absolutely against any kind of censorship wherever it happens you know the school or public life or private life so i'm absolutely against it so this is my take on it 

112.87 118.13 B: oh very good well i have to agree with you i i also don't believe in censorship i think that um 

118.36 122.89 B: public schools and private schools um you know schoolchildren have a 

122.92 131.18 B: right to know about everything that goes on in the world i don't think that anything should be censored yeah and i feel that the media tries to censor a lot 

124.30 125.20 A: right 

125.52 126.98 A: absolutely 

130.57 132.65 A: yes i i feel that also 

131.39 132.58 B: and i you know 

132.84 134.87 B: (( yeah so you know )) 

133.69 135.60 A: especially in the united states 

135.73 142.85 B: yes yes they only um they only broadcast what they want us to hear and [laughter] 

136.69 137.53 A: yeah 

140.44 142.01 A: right right 

142.08 157.02 A: i absolutely agree with you because you know i know it from different sides of the uh of the atlantic now and i know that is true because the different countries our countries handle this differently and the united states is one of the countries that really censors the news 

156.23 158.23 B: right right 

157.07 167.91 A: and it censors the schools and i don't believe that as you know just as you say children should know everything they should have access to everything it doesn't mean they have to read it or to like it or 

167.99 170.87 A: they but they should have the possibility at least 

170.78 173.12 B: right right well you know the the 

171.93 173.26 A: do you have children 

173.26 177.97 B: yeah i have two children i have two very young children one of them is six and the other one is eight 

177.71 178.74 A: yeah 

178.02 191.53 B: and um you know they haven't really started learning about um you know history yet but you know when they start to learn about history i want them to learn about not just american history but world history 

183.15 184.25 A: right 

190.91 191.82 A: yeah 

191.63 196.86 B: and i'd like them to learn about you know all the horrible things atrocities that happened 

196.15 198.93 A: right and are still happening right 

198.19 207.13 B: yeah and that are still happening you know i don't think that anything should be um kept from them you know i i feel that maybe we would be a better world now 

202.71 203.69 A: right 

207.13 214.45 B: um you know if people were made aware when they were younger of you know what what human beings do to each other 

210.06 211.18 A: right 

211.34 212.26 A: right 

213.98 219.00 A: right i think it's that's the point the awareness you know you have to be aware and once you are aware you 

214.99 215.73 B: so 

219.05 221.16 A: you you live your life differently 

221.08 228.50 B: that's right yeah you definitely do yeah i feel very fortunate to you know to have a lot of um 

222.27 223.59 A: absolutely 

228.67 230.42 B: different um 

231.14 237.23 B: different um medias you know coming through my my computer at work

430.71 433.63 B: yeah oh well that's nice you know i just 

433.65 437.58 B: i feel like i'm missing so much you know by working full time 

437.11 439.00 A: yeah with the kids probably no 

437.68 442.95 B: and not yeah and not being at home with the children i do i feel like i really miss out on a lot 

440.64 441.73 A: right 

443.31 446.43 B: no because here i don't know what it's like in illinois but 

446.51 451.63 B: here there aren't any after school programs that you can put your children into without having to pay for them 

449.18 450.10 A: (( mm )) 

451.34 463.86 A: oh yeah you have to pay for them here too i'm sure there are some social programs but basically no you have to pay for everything here also you see my daughter is already twenty seven so and she grew up in europe so i don't know about this 

453.41 455.25 B: yeah oh 

457.71 459.65 B: yeah yeah see 

462.13 463.26 B: oh 

463.88 467.62 A: but i only know what i hear from friends and people here they pay dearly 

464.39 465.13 B: well 

467.63 469.90 B: it is ridiculously expensive [lipsmack] 

468.96 469.70 A: (( [cough] )) 

469.93 470.92 A: (( yeah it is )) 

470.23 473.53 B: i think we we pay close to a thousand dollars a month 

473.02 474.23 A: for two kids 

473.66 476.68 B: um for two kids to be watched after school 

475.23 480.29 A: mm that's that's a lot do you know what that makes me question a question if it's 

477.14 478.15 B: yeah 

480.49 486.40 A: profitable at all for you to work full time huh when you think about that that you pay a thousand dollars 

484.32 485.72 B: yeah well you know 

486.14 495.27 B: yeah it it is because um yeah rents are very high here in california where i am [sigh] everything is a little more expensive here in fact 

487.42 489.14 A: it is yeah 

494.08 498.53 A: yeah i know i know that but it's a great place to be 

496.22 497.51 B: i have a friend that 

497.74 503.46 B: oh it's it's it's absolutely beautiful here it really is i wouldn't live anywhere else but i have a friend 

501.89 505.49 A: right i hate it here [laughter] 

503.74 510.62 B: do you well i have a friend that just moved back um they lived in our building and she and her husband decided to 

506.00 507.69 A: really [laughter] 

508.29 509.29 A: yeah 

510.75 516.25 B: um move back to uh chicago a place just outside of chicago because her parents 

514.87 518.79 A: yeah i lived also in chicago in the west western suburbs 

518.90 526.49 B: well you know she sent a picture um of a house that they had built and i couldn't believe it what they got for their money 

523.01 524.32 A: mhm 

526.22 527.48 A: yeah yeah 

526.76 539.03 B: i think they paid maybe two hundred and twenty five thousand dollars for this house for for the land and for the house to be built and it's got five bedrooms it's two stories they've got a forest in their backyard and 

530.56 531.63 A: mhm 

535.43 536.34 A: wow

546.28 547.06 A: (( mm )) 

546.73 551.68 B: i i don't know she says it's about um a twenty five minute drive outside of chicago 

551.73 555.91 A: okay that could be pretty close to where i live because that's approximately 

552.27 553.33 B: um because 

556.02 563.34 A: where i live when there's no traffic you know when there's traffic it's about a two and a half to a three hour drive but you know that much better from where you live there 

560.32 561.71 B: (( right )) 

563.06 567.53 B: oh we have horrible traffic here yeah yeah yeah 

564.47 578.19 A: right right you see i lived in montana before i moved here i moved here because of my husband's job but i really loved montana before that i lived in atlanta for six years and now i'm this area and i really do not like it much 

577.54 580.69 B: oh now what is it that you don't like is it the weather 

580.55 585.50 A: i don't like the weather i don't like the landscape it's everything's just flat you know there's 

584.66 586.13 B: oh god
