13.23 16.46 A: so just to give us an idea of of location 

15.78 17.45 B: yeah okay 

16.52 23.06 A: um yes i think schools should be able to tell them what books to read if it's uh part of the academic course 

23.70 26.16 B: (( i agree with you yes okay )) 

24.69 26.37 A: yes uh 

26.63 30.14 A: and i know sometimes some of the sch- some of the parents have been 

30.34 35.61 A: at least from what i've read in some places because my kids are all grown and gone now uh 

35.92 41.82 A: some of the parents have been upset but i th- over some of the books but i think those are the parents that also don't 

42.09 49.34 A: uh realize the uh educational benefit of them being well rounded readers under a supervision 

50.38 54.29 B: right i i i definitely agree my son is um grown

54.31 56.63 B: and uh he's twenty seven and 

56.86 68.01 B: you know um [lipsmack] i never really had that i never had that problem or never you know have spoken to anyone who had a problem with um you know the selection of the books 

67.03 68.76 A: right right 

69.38 70.37 B: um 

70.83 78.15 A: but i think that it's better for them to read stuff and get questions answered by someone who can answer it rather than just having read stuff 

78.23 82.23 A: and not understanding or taking it out of context too 

82.27 90.44 A: i think that's that's part of the educational system i really believe that the stuff that they've asked them to read i mean some of the stuff is classic stuff i mean 

90.46 98.05 A: we didn't take it as being uh perverted or anything like that when we were growing up and reading it 

96.30 99.97 B: or infringing on your or infringing on your on your 

99.92 101.49 A: yeah i mean 

100.30 104.09 B: your choices infringing on your choices or you know um 

103.05 111.10 A: you know i have a catholic education and i i think it's it's some of the greatest that anybody could ever have because they do 

105.12 105.75 B: (( mm )) 

111.32 120.40 A: uh go into depth with some of the things and explain well this is you know this was the custom or this was this and 

120.41 126.62 A: i don't know j- i think today they're they're just looking for so many things they read stuff into stuff that isn't even there 

125.97 129.03 B: yeah i agree with you there plus um [lipsmack] 

129.25 132.39 B: like you said being a rel- a well rounded person 

132.08 133.02 A: right 

132.60 134.00 B: um and 

133.83 138.32 B: understanding [sigh] um in other words being exposed to things that 

138.15 152.43 B: you wouldn't normally think of um from someone who has experience and background [sigh] someone who is a little little older in terms of you know [sigh] trying to give you the experiences and um sharing their knowledge and 

139.88 140.71 A: right 

152.34 153.55 B: and um 

153.71 168.51 B: you know and i i look at it l- you know like that because i've actually had young people tell me [sigh] oh you know i didn't know anything about that particular subject or that particular topic i'm glad you you know explained some things to me because i've never really thought of that 

163.24 164.31 A: mhm 

167.86 168.86 A: right 

168.50 172.16 B: so um i agree with you um one hundred percent 

170.70 174.36 A: yeah i think they're letter education just get out of hand i mean uh 

173.38 175.68 B: i think so too i think so too 

174.49 181.72 A: the woman across the street from me has a fourteen year old and i look at the stuff that they're doing and learning in school and i'm thinking 

181.73 182.73 A: you know 

182.88 185.63 A: these kids are not going to be ready for anything 

185.37 186.95 B: (( that's right that's right )) 

186.07 194.51 A: you know they don't know how to balance a check book they don't know how to make a budget or a shopping list i mean and those things are all important they're just as important as 

194.74 198.06 A: as anything else the big emphasis today seems to be on sports 

197.76 202.54 B: yes that's right and and well not only um 

202.91 206.83 B: um the work ethic is not there any more [sigh] um mhm well 

205.04 217.47 A: oh you know i hear this all the time because i i'm an independent consultant and i'll tell ya i go into stores and the people they're griping and groaning about the help and this and that 

214.92 216.11 B: that's right right 

217.58 220.42 A: and those are things that only come 

220.65 228.22 A: with a well rounded education and knowing that yes you have to do this in order to get this 

227.60 239.56 B: that's right exposure a lot of them you know and [sigh] i agree with you there they just don't have the exposure [sigh] i think that they need to understand what it takes to really 

229.20 230.12 A: (( yeah )) 

239.45 246.89 B: um [lipsmack] get out here and become make a living and to be and to be to become a productive citizen 

241.83 244.13 A: and make a living and survive 

246.25 259.11 A: yeah well a lot of it i blame on some of the parents they just hand their kids everything they don't have to work i don't know about you but when i was growing up as a kid i had a paper route all right guaranteed now that may not be a safe thing 

258.90 259.77 B: right 

259.17 268.15 A: to have a paper route but in your immediate neighborhood if you can't know your neighbors i mean i sold candy i made pot holders i used to shovel snow 

268.32 276.92 A: can't get the kid across the street he won't even shovel his mother's own walk he says one day how much you gonna pay me i almost picked up my hand and smacked him side the head 

271.56 273.11 B: right that's right 

273.62 274.76 B: that's right 

275.11 278.40 B: [laughter] that's right i i 

277.46 282.50 A: i mean the [sigh] [sigh] you know to me they don't have the family values 

278.41 280.42 B: yeah yeah so 

282.59 287.55 A: um or the sense of helping and both parents work 

287.33 289.03 B: that's right that's right 

287.99 294.17 A: you know and [sigh] i don't know maybe because i raised my kids from the time they could toddle they had chores 

294.18 306.93 A: even if they weren't perfect i mean put the toys in the toy basket and pull up the sheets on your bed you know i never looked for perfection because they're children but these kids today don't have to do that and it's a shame 

301.07 302.08 B: (( yeah right )) 

302.16 303.50 B: right but at least 

304.56 305.51 B: right 

305.66 306.39 B: (( re- re- )) 

306.90 308.56 B: responsibility [sigh] 

308.20 310.69 A: yeah and they learn that by reading 

310.19 316.56 B: that's right that's right and reading and and and really and reading a little bit of everything 

316.37 317.28 A: (( yes )) 

316.80 319.41 B: and and and putting themselves in 

318.78 321.93 A: i mean even the classic- even heidi for instance 

321.12 323.05 B: that's right that's right 

322.04 326.66 A: i mean [sigh] there were chores there were responsibilities 

326.12 329.68 B: mhm mhm and and and people don't realize that [sigh] 

329.83 342.77 B: with that kind of exposure in other words you're opening up a person's mind to say hey life isn't just this way life is you know um i'm looking at it through other 

334.00 335.18 A: oh yeah 

342.96 346.96 B: through another person's eyes and really trying to 

344.90 345.75 A: mhm 

347.08 354.76 B: ex- experience some of the things that go on not just only in our culture but in all cultures 

354.01 358.42 A: oh yes i i heartily agree and i think that was one of the best things 

355.20 356.14 B: (( you know )) 

358.44 360.73 A: uh with a catholic education 

360.88 366.19 A: the books that you read exposed you to that and then you talked about it 

363.99 365.18 B: (( that's right )) 

365.48 366.82 B: that's right 

366.49 368.71 A: and that that's part of of 

368.87 373.25 A: that's the biggest part of any education system is to teach 

373.31 378.40 A: and to to get that point across and they don't do this i mean 

377.72 379.56 B: yeah yeah i agree 

378.71 380.27 A: it's horrendous 

379.89 388.32 B: yeah my girlfriend is a school teacher [sigh] and every she she retired but she went back and every year she's gonna retire again

416.87 424.19 A: of what we have in this country right and then they then there wouldn't be all these people saying well we shouldn't be in this war that we're in 

417.44 418.10 B: of 

418.20 419.73 B: right right 

424.01 425.35 B: (( right right )) 

424.23 431.51 A: because most of 'em they have no clue what they're fighting for they don't understand how oppressed these people have been because they don't they haven't read 

431.27 433.56 B: right right that's right that [lipsmack] 

432.18 443.79 A: you know they only hear the bad stuff they don't hear about the good people of that are that are in a situation i mean today they were talking about some of the looting yeah they're looting food for the most part 

443.85 446.14 A: out of this one warehouse i mean 

446.88 453.06 A: but there again history repeats itself and if they read and they and they would read the classics 

452.48 454.18 B: right mhm right that's right

467.66 468.58 A: right 

468.25 476.27 B: if you study history find out what you know some of the problems that other societies have had 

476.53 481.14 B: you can you can try to improve your society 

480.54 494.57 A: right and you can see how the government works i mean you've read any of any of shakespeare's stuff and you can almost take the same situations and apply it to the to with our everyday characters in fact they have made 

492.03 493.28 B: mm that's right 

494.60 500.42 A: um a couple of the shakespeare stories and and updated them and made a movie um

527.86 531.96 A: and how people actually thought then and how 

532.49 542.02 A: i don't know the whole the whole thing you have to have a basis i mean now when you watch comedy if you don't have a background in some of their stuff you have no clue what they're talking about 

536.12 537.14 B: (( yes yes )) 

541.33 545.26 B: that's right that's right [sigh] and even when [sigh] you know if you
