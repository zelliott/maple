0.00 1.74 A: hi my name's kelly 

1.29 3.67 B: hi my name is ann 

3.49 5.29 A: (( hi how are you )) 

4.80 6.70 B: i'm good how are you 

6.17 8.05 A: (( good thank you well )) 

8.13 11.89 A: um i guess i can start if you want 

11.22 12.37 B: okay 

11.95 19.09 A: i i actually do exercise um regularly i go to i'm a taekwando student so martial arts 

19.40 20.49 B: uh-huh 

20.25 34.66 A: and um so i go like three or four times a week and i exercise for an hour each time and um it's a pretty good workout 'cause we do that plus we do like cardio kickboxing kind of thing during the class so it's pretty aerobic 

31.83 32.96 B: uh-huh 

34.26 35.44 B: uh-huh 

35.33 36.63 A: so um 

35.96 40.34 B: well i do not exercise regularly i should 

40.05 41.41 A: [laughter] 

40.43 47.55 B: but i don't um i have participated in water aerobics 

47.72 52.62 B: i think i am going to start back i feel better when i do them 

52.49 57.02 A: oh yeah you always feel so much better it's like it gives you so much more energy 

56.58 61.10 B: it does and it that doesn't make any sense but it does 

59.69 63.26 A: yeah it's kinda weird because you would think that you would get tired 

62.62 65.71 B: mhm well well i do get tired 

65.38 66.44 A: uh-huh 

66.31 74.79 B: but uh i know before when i was in water aerobics i found that it makes my stamina so much better 

74.67 84.92 A: that's supposed to be really good for you too because it with the resistance of the water really helps and it's not um stressful to anything 

76.79 79.05 B: mhm mhm 

80.64 81.83 B: mhm 

84.42 88.02 B: well they they tell you that wa- just walking 

87.89 89.06 A: mhm 

88.40 93.20 B: in the water for fifteen minutes is equivalent to walking for an hour 

93.35 94.73 A: wow 

94.42 99.02 B: so that's a pretty you know that's a pretty good trade off i think 

98.48 101.90 A: that's fantastic do you go to a gym for that 

101.27 103.71 B: um sports com yeah 

103.12 107.86 A: yeah yeah that's i mean that's so great i've seen that in my gym and 

103.94 104.98 B: mhm 

107.66 119.78 A: i they do it most of the time when i'm at work so i haven't been able to really participate but yeah i mean it looks like it's a great workout and it's funny 'cause you're thinking oh well it's just in the pool how big of a deal could it be 

110.29 111.42 B: mhm 

114.96 115.75 B: it 

119.53 129.03 B: right well i usually swim after we get through with our class for a little while that's the only kinda exercise that i enjoy at all doing 

128.89 130.38 A: yeah 

129.68 133.46 B: [laughter] i'm old and set in my ways 

133.01 140.71 A: (( [laughter] well you know it yes yeah [laughter] )) 

138.39 142.29 B: but i didn't like exercise when i wasn't old so [laughter] 

142.43 154.66 A: it's kinda hard to get into it really is i mean you know it's funny 'cause sometimes like my class for taekwando will be half an hour and i'm like oh do i really wanna go and since i have to drag myself to get there 

154.20 155.59 B: right 

154.87 163.26 A: but um you know it's usually worth it and i usually it's a great stress reliever 'cause i'm punching things and kicking things [laughter] 

161.25 169.21 B: right and you know once you get there get started it's not so bad it's just do i really want to do this 

168.83 174.53 A: exactly exactly that's i mean yeah it's just getting myself to go 

174.14 175.35 B: mhm 

174.57 186.75 A: but like the gym i have a lot of problems because i wouldn't have anybody there waiting for me to meet me there to get me to make sure that i went but like with my class if i don't go 

180.31 181.49 B: mhm 

186.55 195.37 A: my friends or the instructors will be all like where were you [laughter] and they'll call me and so that's helpful too 

190.33 192.16 B: mhm mhm 

195.45 196.45 B: yeah 

195.68 197.19 A: just for me 

196.64 197.53 B: yeah 

197.24 199.47 A: but um yeah it's 

199.02 200.65 B: now where are you from

225.51 226.57 B: uh-huh 

226.20 233.28 A: and so um it's funny 'cause i talk to him and he's a accent and sometimes i pick it up and it's 

233.39 243.55 A: funny 'cause i'll be out here talking and i'll talk to somebody and they'll be like what'd you say [laughter] well i talked to my dad [laughter] i picked it up [laughter] 

242.66 247.00 B: [laughter] yeah well i picked up some some northern 

247.58 249.84 B: in your in your voice 

249.51 253.79 A: yeah yeah the massachusetts comes through every once in a while 

253.26 255.18 B: mhm mhm 

254.46 258.35 A: my school was pretty close to boston so it picked up a little bit of that 

258.17 259.67 B: mhm 

259.09 266.23 A: (( [laughter] yeah every once in a while i say something and you know even here and they say what are you saying )) 

265.79 268.14 B: (( [laughter] )) 

267.51 275.61 A: [laughter] well [laughter] i mean you know let me say it really slowly [laughter] and enunciate yeah 

272.76 273.90 B: mhm 

275.08 276.39 B: (( mhm [sigh] )) 

275.78 287.79 A: yeah but how did yeah i mean i guess let's see more health and exercise questions i'm trying to think was there another another kind of exercise that you'd ever done beside from the water aerobics 

288.20 290.70 B: i tried the uh 

290.81 295.23 B: hilt club thing many years ago and 

292.47 293.63 A: uh-huh 

295.36 306.07 B: i just never could get into that i just couldn't get the least bit excited about that i wa- exercise just does not excite me at all it never has [laughter] 

303.02 304.58 A: [laughter] yeah 

304.91 312.24 A: yeah it's you know it's kinda boring i i had tried the um the gym like the machines and stuff and it's just like 

310.67 312.02 B: yeah 

312.29 313.92 A: so boring 

313.32 325.12 B: yeah i i tried that many many many years ago and i just it's just not my cup of the only thing i really enjoyed about that was going in the uh 

325.60 331.16 B: uh sauna and um and i did enjoy that part of it 

326.92 328.64 A: oh yeah 

330.43 333.12 A: yeah i really miss that it 

332.38 337.35 B: the things that don't require movement you know [laughter] you just sit there [laughter] 

334.93 342.55 A: [laughter] see i like that 'cause you go in there and then you look like you've been exercising 'cause you're all sweaty and you know like yeah 

340.63 343.90 B: right right now i like that part of it 

343.18 345.02 A: [laughter] 

344.36 350.47 B: i sound like i am really i'm really not nearly as lazy as i sound like [laughter] 

349.83 360.52 A: oh no no but i know exactly i mean and you know it's it's hard especially you know as you get older it's like the less less you wanna go 

360.16 361.34 B: right 

360.53 371.42 A: and you know i don't know it's i can't imagine i mean sometimes it's like i'm only thirty and i sometimes i find it like really a struggle [laughter] to get going so 

371.37 378.97 A: i'm like oh when i get a little older like when i hit forty or fifty i wonder you know how i'm gonna be able to pull it off [laughter] 

378.25 384.01 B: well i think a lot a lot depends on how much you like it when you're younger 

383.73 384.91 A: mhm 

384.23 386.79 B: and how much you participate 

386.48 387.68 A: yeah 

387.04 388.64 B: and uh 

388.90 399.12 B: if you're not really into it you'll wake up one morning when you're fifty five or so and you'll see all your sagging parts [laughter] 

398.53 403.89 A: (( [laughter] i'm starting to see that actually already it's kinda sad i don't know what happened but )) 

402.75 405.76 B: well let me tell you it gets worse 

405.17 411.36 A: (( somewhere around thirty it is as soon as i hit thirty i woke up and i thought boy this changed [laughter] )) 

411.72 418.48 A: (( this wasn't like this before [laughter] [laughter] how exactly )) 

414.19 416.23 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

417.43 422.13 B: well it only gets worse unless you do something about it 

421.53 435.27 A: yeah yeah it's i guess like it's funny 'cause the taekwando takes care of some of it but like i remember when i was a kid people used to make fun of the teachers 'cause the arms underneath the arms where it would swing 

433.34 434.33 B: uh-huh 

434.84 435.94 B: uh-huh 

435.59 440.03 A: and i was like oh i'm never gonna have that i have that now 

436.38 438.56 B: yes i have that [laughter] 

439.60 441.50 B: everybody's gonna have that 

440.91 442.69 A: [laughter] 

442.01 445.82 B: you know gravi- gravity is not real kind [laughter] 

444.81 451.68 A: (( [laughter] no it doesn't seem like it will be [laughter] everything's just kind of shifting [laughter] )) 

447.50 449.35 B: [laughter] 

450.26 454.98 B: yup yup everything just kind of sags and bags it's just [laughter] 

454.21 461.67 A: [laughter] yeah it's kinda [laughter] it's more frustrating but i guess what can you do i mean if everybody's going to go through it 

459.97 469.39 B: and you know really there's there's something that kinda not quite fair about that because the heavier somebody is 

469.88 474.57 B: as they get older the less the sag and the bag shows 

474.13 476.51 A: isn't that funny how that works 

475.06 487.07 B: when you're you know when you're i mean i'm not being vain i mean you know a pencil by any means but i'm not grossly overweight or anything like that either 

485.79 487.01 A: right 

487.04 490.97 B: and it seems like there's you're saggier 

491.32 493.78 B: when there's not as much to sag 

493.20 495.73 A: [laughter] it's like it shows more 

495.62 497.05 B: i think so 

496.83 498.22 A: (( yeah it's just )) 

498.37 506.07 A: [laughter] i don't know it's kinda it is it's disheartening [laughter] 'cause you feel it should be the other way around 

502.76 503.94 B: mhm 

505.54 516.55 B: but if you keep everything toned up you'll be g- you'll be fine uh i i did not keep things toned up [laughter] that requires work [laughter] 

516.27 525.72 A: well some of the girls i work with you know are in a gym every day you know doing their like aerobics and i just i can't get motivated to do anything like that 

525.04 526.09 B: (( nah )) 

525.83 530.86 A: i have just you know so much time and i just i guess i don't enjoy that [laughter] 

530.17 536.57 B: well i do when i do when i do participate in the water aerobics i go twice a week 

536.36 537.48 A: mhm 

536.80 540.38 B: and that seems to be enough 

540.21 542.43 A: yeah how long is the class 

540.87 541.69 B: i can 

542.04 543.26 B: it's an hour 

543.13 544.61 A: (( oh that's a good length )) 

544.45 548.91 B: it the class is an hour and then if you want to stay 

548.96 552.40 B: and swim or if you want to go early and swim 

552.14 553.43 A: mhm 

552.51 556.87 B: you can do that you can stay as long as want to after the class is over 

556.78 558.68 A: oh wow that's nice 

557.36 560.74 B: 'cause where they have 'em uh they have one in the morning 

560.98 563.22 B: it's like at nine o'clock 

563.30 567.17 B: which is not bad and then they have one at six 

567.91 570.83 B: in the evening which is not bad 

567.99 569.70 A: that's pretty good 

570.19 575.85 A: yeah that's great now do you stretch before you start doing your exercises in the pool too 

575.48 583.83 B: no we walk first we wal- the first fifteen minutes of class is just walking back and forth across the pool 

577.41 578.65 A: okay 

583.23 584.74 A: wow 

584.21 593.19 B: and then the uh stretching exercises and all this that we do in the water moves every joint in your body 

593.63 599.95 A: that's fantastic i should i should get my like relatives involved in something like this
