116.78 119.07 B: after kids [cough] 

118.33 126.34 A: you take it off very slowly and it tends to stay off better but they do you know they do stress some exercise and i did 

122.27 123.18 B: huh 

126.33 129.55 A: i've all these tapes they're called walk away the pounds 

128.83 129.75 B: uh-huh 

129.54 141.71 A: and it's a video tape and they last average about a half hour and um it's a good work out it's a really good workout first thing in the morning oh yeah 

139.15 140.02 B: huh 

141.07 142.17 B: yeah 

141.95 149.60 A: yeah you get about the tape the target and it seemed to be the rage with um the people at weight watchers 

149.31 150.26 B: huh 

150.05 151.44 A: yeah 

150.44 154.84 B: yeah was that walk away the pounds that's a good idea i'll have to check that out 

152.34 153.48 A: yeah 

154.52 158.40 A: yeah lesley sandson is the lady that's in it 

157.66 159.96 B: oh that's familiar yeah okay 

158.99 162.49 A: yeah um i was really 

161.04 165.24 B: so have you heard do you know people on the atkins have you heard anything about that or 

164.49 170.02 A: i don't know anything anybody on it mhm i really don't know a whole lot about it 

168.90 178.82 B: it's the thing where you you know eat all the protein and not the carbohydrates but i think the reason it was appealing is uh we had a friend who just lost seventeen pounds in two weeks and it was 

172.27 173.51 A: yeah 

178.20 180.03 A: ooh that's not good 

179.27 182.09 B: yeah we'll that's what i wondered it just looked appealing 

180.95 184.60 A: ah she lost a lot of water 

184.08 185.41 B: (( yeah )) 

184.84 193.19 A: not fat you need to lose fat and in order to lose fat you need to eat less fat and increase your fiber 

185.84 186.91 B: right 

189.99 190.99 B: right 

193.88 196.27 A: because fiber is like um 

196.54 205.76 A: my husband describes it as being uh a scrub brush for your insides [laughter] helps clean you out [laughter] 

201.11 201.94 B: (( huh )) 

202.34 203.63 B: yeah that's good 

204.40 211.22 B: well i'm still nursing and i think because of that i feel like i can't really focus too much on losing until i'm done nursing 

210.96 212.95 A: well 

213.06 217.42 A: you can but not too much you don't wanna lose too much 

213.07 215.23 B: i guess i just feel like i don't wanna 

216.67 222.64 B: well yeah i mean i just i i i notice that i'm i feel like i'm always a lot hungrier when i'm nursing and 

221.56 230.04 A: oh yeah you need to drink plenty i'm nursing too i've i have six kids so i've nursed five of 'em yeah really wow 

225.67 231.98 B: oh my gosh we have four but yeah this is our fourth i'm thinking this is it though but

243.61 244.92 A: but um 

244.16 245.86 B: well that's great 

245.25 248.70 A: yeah and it's hard to exercise too when you've got a nursing baby 

248.54 257.36 B: right that's the thing with that's what i'm finding out just it's finding time and with the um older ones it seems like there's a lot of driving around and 

256.25 263.87 A: uh-huh tell me about it my oldest is thirteen so you know and the youngest will be two next month so
