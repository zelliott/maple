24.30 28.37 A: you know checking it out i don't know i might go back to hawaii i don't know yet 

28.30 29.87 B: [laughter] 

29.28 34.37 A: so anyway i guess we're not supposed to talk about that we're supposed to talk about censorship 

33.79 37.00 B: censorship um 

35.02 38.33 A: d- d- did they tell you did you hear it about it 

37.68 39.83 B: yes yes i heard uh-huh 

39.60 46.85 A: and um i happen to be a teacher and it said something about what do you think about censoring books in the schools 

47.07 51.66 B: right um does private schools um have the right to 

51.94 57.97 B: um decide what's books students read that's what i think that's what i heard 

58.03 58.99 B: right 

58.72 63.65 A: yeah i think i might have heard public or private but i don't think it makes any difference because 

62.76 63.60 B: yeah 

63.59 77.22 A: well i'll just say that i don't agree with it i don't agree with censorship i'm not saying i wanna bunch of swear words in there for my kids but um i mean i'm talking about my students now i don't have my own kids but um [lipsmack] 

77.47 79.83 A: i think censorship is wrong 

79.91 80.65 B: mhm 

80.01 90.25 A: because for one you know well okay some of these people like with harry potter they think that that's like the devil or sorcery or something 

90.09 91.12 B: (( [laughter] right )) 

90.18 96.55 A: but you know it just depends how you take it there's value in everything right so i don't know that's my opinion 

94.73 95.72 B: right 

96.69 100.62 B: now can i ask you what what what what are the ages of your students 

101.63 103.04 A: well um 

102.45 104.62 B: i mean what grade or rather rather 

103.91 112.00 A: i've taught all grades actually but mostly like sixth grade and then also third grade and also first grade 

111.92 114.09 B: (( oh because the reason why i ask you because )) 

114.38 124.98 B: you know i think i i'm against censorship as well um because i think that if it should matters it should matter only you 

125.24 128.95 B: know in the way that the writers can best express themselves 

129.47 130.56 B: um 

130.59 133.67 B: and if a writer feels more comfortable using 

133.86 135.21 B: uh the 

135.41 137.42 B: society's you know 

137.39 139.99 A: vernacular or whatever the word is 

137.43 139.29 B: (( um )) 

139.37 142.23 B: vulgar vulgar words or whatever you wanna say 

142.33 145.95 B: you know i mean if it makes it that's the way he feels 

146.26 147.39 A: yeah but 

146.27 151.26 B: you know i think i think that he should have the right to use it and i think 

151.57 152.88 B: students 

152.95 158.36 B: who uh feel you know more comfortable reading you know a book that's more 

158.47 159.84 B: open-minded like 

159.21 160.22 A: well 

160.35 163.50 A: and if we were being like teachers like what do you do 

163.58 164.84 B: i'm an accountant 

164.43 171.63 A: okay well pretend you're a teacher for a minute i think and i just got off the phone with some principals and stuff here 

171.48 175.98 A: that what we need to do is decide what what grade level it would be 

175.84 182.13 A: so you know if we agreed i think we do we sound like we're kind of of the same mind that 

181.90 191.69 A: like high school kids are gonna swear among themselves anyway and it's their choice like after sixteen to either swear or not swear even though you know 

185.44 186.16 B: (( right )) 

191.77 205.89 A: it's not appropriate in the classroom but if they choose to read a book like what you're talking about i would say okay and yet the idiots at fourteen [laughter] don't let me 

204.38 205.36 B: (( [laughter] )) 

205.78 220.40 A: taint that at all with that word idiot but let's just say they're not able to discern the difference between well this book had a bunch of swear words so i'm gonna go and swear at you the teacher and all these kids around me you know what i'm saying 

220.08 221.42 B: right right 

220.85 225.15 A: so it it definitely has to do with the age yeah 

222.64 223.20 B: (( [cough] )) 

225.14 233.83 B: yeah i i agree um you know i i i think when i i didn't like i wrote that way in college and uh 

232.94 234.04 A: oh 

233.88 241.47 B: [laughter] that's the reason why i asked you know how old your students were but you know it wasn't like every other word was a 

234.69 236.19 A: (( [laughter] )) 

241.63 244.10 B: curse word you know or whatever but it was just 

243.12 246.74 A: right well even in poetry like sometimes you have to 

246.84 251.56 A: you know get more colorful but and it but sometimes it's not effective like 

248.70 249.84 B: (( right right )) 

250.98 255.00 B: exactly exactly i mean if i was writing a book on 

255.10 266.57 B: uh i don't know religion or something of course i wouldn't use you know s- a lot of those words but you know certain other topics i think that it definitely gives a creative edge 

266.43 268.84 A: see you know what i think they're getting at 

269.11 277.97 A: i think they're talking about like that religious issue like that creationism thing or whatever it is that some of these religions 

278.57 284.59 A: and i'm talking more like i don't know what i don't think it's jehovah's witness that believes that but those kids 

284.81 298.99 A: if they're in my class the parents like tell you up front that they can't celebrate their birthday they can't go to a dance they can't celebrate christmas they can't do any of this stuff okay now i'm not sure if they're the ones but somebody out there 

292.96 294.49 B: (( [lipsmack] [laughter] oh yeah yeah )) 

297.67 300.40 B: yeah that's that's it yeah that's it 

299.86 312.19 A: you know they're saying i mean i- i- i don't even know about like islam and all those people what they think about this i'm still trying to figure out all those religions i'm just working with the ones around america here 

308.53 310.76 B: (( mm )) 

312.05 325.65 A: but they they have these movements and and they tell the school and this girl i heard about through my mom from my high school turned into a big holy roller and she's been fighting the school board like 

325.72 327.18 A: this um 

327.83 337.92 A: i don't know some book that normally is no problem like stuart little or something and they say yes but stuart little are you still there 

337.74 338.78 B: (( yeah i'm here )) 

338.23 341.43 A: okay like that really is about um 

341.73 343.99 A: heaven and hell and um 

344.11 345.56 A: in that in that 

345.75 350.74 A: god didn't create you know whatever you know that's that that 

351.16 359.71 B: yeah they they you know they come from these fanatical views you know you know but totally off the wall you know 

351.53 353.00 A: what do you call it 

359.94 365.29 B: but yeah i i've heard all kinds of different interpretations of different things 

365.53 368.79 B: (( you know like harry potter for instance it's a perfect example )) 

369.05 372.04 A: yeah that they think it's like the devil or something 

370.76 373.40 B: um witchcraft yeah 

373.01 381.63 A: and so they would be like yep dead set against that and okay that's banned and so i mean as a teacher of course i would respect that 

381.40 393.89 A: that i'm not gonna force them i would have an alternate choice because you know our thing is to be more sensitive to everybody you wouldn't force them to read it whereas when i don't know how old you are but you sound like more my age like forty something 

381.47 382.33 B: (( mhm )) 

385.20 386.05 B: right 

393.76 399.55 B: [laughter] uh i'm i'm younger i'm thirty thirty one yeah 

394.80 396.18 A: are you younger 

397.90 407.34 A: oh you're a youngun but but anyway like thinking back a couple of years you know like when i was in high school i mean they made you read the stuff 

399.78 402.40 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

407.45 408.43 B: yeah 

407.90 409.77 A: you had to read that 

409.84 411.45 A: whatever it was 

409.91 410.63 B: (( mhm )) 

412.40 420.41 B: so let me ask you a question then do you think if you seen a student who wrote that way or you know wanted to read a book or whatever 

419.28 425.56 A: well i would say i can't accept it because i teach elementary school so i can't have any swear words 

425.83 428.24 B: i mean let's say if you were a high school teacher 

427.87 429.32 A: high school 

429.12 430.14 B: (( uh right )) 

429.24 435.52 A: i would have to see what my staff was telling me they might have a policy which of course i would 

435.39 440.89 A: adhere to the school's policy because if you don't have a policy the place is a shambles 

440.77 454.46 A: now let's say they're really hip and to a point that you know catcher in the rye and some of these stories where they throw in a little bad word here and there for effect and they're they're hip to that 

454.90 468.93 A: i would say okay but i'm not gonna like i've learned over the years you don't wanna butt the principal and make some kind of stand well i demand that my kids are allowed to swear in their creative writing you know 

468.82 469.95 B: right 

468.98 474.48 A: because it's not worth it it's like to me that is so small at this 

470.73 471.50 B: (( yes )) 

474.66 477.90 A: time the bigger idea is such 

477.99 480.40 A: more you know it's so much more important 

480.47 481.43 B: that's true 

482.80 484.47 B: that's true mm 

483.12 491.55 A: but see if you censor something let's say it is high school and it's like world uh history and then you're talking about 

491.31 499.63 A: different religions and and you have to you're not allowed to teach anything this could even be happening today and we don't even know it 

499.53 507.62 A: like like say you're not allowed to teach anything about islam or you know this whole part of the world where we're at war and all these religions 

507.83 509.98 A: so how are they ever gonna know 

510.02 510.92 B: right 

510.55 519.74 A: you know what i mean they block off what exactly would help them to come to a better comprehension of what it's all about 

519.18 521.27 B: right they are given a choice 

521.60 530.39 B: to choose you know what what they feel comfortable with it's just here it's take this and that's it get outta here you know sorta like a 

530.84 533.30 B: (( communist country you know but )) 

532.32 536.77 A: exactly that's exactly what i think of with censorship 

536.62 538.34 B: mhm yeah 

536.99 548.29 A: because look at we're so lucky in america and that came up during the whole thing with iraq i kept reminding the kids you know we are so lucky look at the freedoms we have compared with so many other countries 

540.22 540.78 B: (( [cough] )) 

548.37 550.21 B: (( that's true that's true )) 

549.57 555.24 A: and and you know if you don't like it i mean some people i'm not gonna say if you don't like it get out 

555.16 565.05 A: but i'm like if if you're saying you don't understand what kind of freedoms you have in this country let me tell you about a few other countries 

565.02 565.97 B: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

565.11 568.34 A: and what they do to their people like in china 

569.51 572.60 B: yeah i mean they put you in jail for 

573.02 582.42 B: you know saying anything bad against the pres- the leader or anything against their ideas or or maybe even in front of a gun squad you know 

581.69 585.53 A: yeah i was just gonna say or worse besides the imprisonment 

585.56 588.05 B: (( you know so i mean yeah that's what i )) 

588.18 591.16 B: i was in the military and i definitely don't take my 

591.37 594.21 B: freedoms of democracy for granted 

594.04 596.24 A: there you go what were you in with 

596.28 597.23 B: navy 

597.17 598.34 A: oh right 

598.13 599.89 B: yeah i was actually in prison
