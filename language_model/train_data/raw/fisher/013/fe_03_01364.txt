0.00 1.70 A: hi this is john 

1.73 4.22 B: hi this is tiffany [noise] 

3.49 5.08 A: (( hey tiffany how's it going )) 

5.02 6.87 B: it's going fine your name please 

6.37 7.51 A: [mn] i'm john 

7.31 8.50 B: john okay 

8.22 9.34 A: yeah 

8.73 11.06 B: i didn't catch that i sort i'm sorry [noise] 

10.64 14.84 A: that's all right so what are we talking about censorship in schools huh 

14.21 18.00 B: censorship in schools yeah sh- sh- should 

15.99 17.30 A: yeah 

18.23 24.40 B: private and public schools have the right to tell kids what they can't read can and cannot read 

24.10 27.49 A: well i think to a certain degree maybe they should you know 

27.31 28.55 B: right i do 

28.38 35.29 A: you know obviously kids aren't necessarily equipped to make those kinds of decisions as to what's appropriate you know 

35.00 36.86 B: yeah judgment calls there 

36.43 37.80 A: yeah 

37.18 38.24 B: definitely 

37.84 49.61 A: [laughter] so i mean you know within reason of course i mean you probably wouldn't want the schools to tell your kids like exactly what they can read or exactly like what they can't like religion and stuff and things like that you know 

38.65 40.33 B: [laughter] 

49.27 50.21 B: right 

50.42 51.85 B: yeah i think they 

52.07 53.01 B: they 

53.10 60.55 B: can to a point tell them what they can and cannot read but most of the input should come from their parents 

60.11 69.39 A: yeah absolutely their parents should definitely be in charge of that and then also it depends on their age too you know whether you're talking about like grade school or or high school 

61.92 62.93 B: (( yeah an- )) 

68.76 70.04 B: right 

69.90 78.76 A: you know 'cause by the time they're in high school you know maybe they should have a little bit more freedom to check out different things that maybe you know at a grade school level they shouldn't you know 

78.51 79.68 B: exactly 

79.70 80.56 A: yeah 

79.89 84.03 B: but then you know who's who's to say what's appropriate at high school age 

84.36 85.20 B: you know 

85.02 91.56 A: well now that's true too isn't that the problem with society you know i mean where do you draw the line and you have to draw the line somewhere 

85.92 87.39 B: [laughter] you know 

90.96 92.19 B: exactly 

92.50 95.30 B: [sigh] and a lot of the times you don't get to draw the line 

94.99 98.49 A: yeah do you have any kids in school 

98.18 100.61 B: yep i have a six year old and an eight year old 

100.16 103.67 A: (( oh i got a six year old and a three year old [laughter] )) 

102.14 106.65 B: [laughter] you're you just don't have double duty yet you just wait 

105.62 108.14 A: no huh does it get worse when they get older 

108.07 113.29 B: well the homework does at least at least here in in our state 

109.81 110.96 A: oh yeah 

112.61 114.45 A: yeah what state is that 

113.85 114.96 B: wisconsin 

114.61 115.94 A: oh wisconsin 

115.77 116.74 B: yeah 

116.17 120.51 A: yeah i think we're straying a little i don't know if [laughter] we get in trouble for that [laughter] 

120.08 122.38 B: [laughter] i don't know if we're supposed to say that either 

121.90 136.08 A: yeah but i don't know my kids um actually we're pretty fortunate the school that my kids actually my six year old is in right now is you know they're great they're really like informative about what the kids are learning and everything and i think they're very appropriate so 

122.86 123.63 B: um 

135.80 136.72 B: right 

136.61 142.65 A: i'm sure to a certain degree that they do censor stuff you know even like the war in iraq right now i mean 

139.84 140.74 B: (( yes )) 

142.84 149.37 A: they've managed to keep that away from my six year olds for the entire war now you know which has been great i think 

148.96 159.76 B: yeah yeah they only place uh my kids hear about it's at home because my husband has to watch it me it's like well it's gonna happen whether i watch it or not so i'm not watching it wasting my time [laughter] 

149.85 150.77 A: (( you know )) 

154.31 155.32 A: yeah 

158.12 162.54 A: yeah me neither i'm not one of those people that obsess on that stuff you know 

163.00 170.33 B: i watch you know i watched when the two towers went down and and of course then the kids at school knew something had gone on 

163.01 163.93 A: (( you know )) 

169.99 174.43 A: oh yeah well i was i mean that's kinda different than war in a sense i mean i don't know 

174.26 176.02 B: yeah well i think 

174.72 177.36 A: i mean they're both tragic but 

177.13 179.83 B: i think on the war subject we're getting a little um 

180.25 183.92 B: [lipsmack] how shall we say too up close and personal [laughter] 

183.19 184.27 A: yeah 

184.35 190.27 A: and that would be a good thing to censor see we're still talking computer [laughter] we're still on censorship 

184.63 185.39 B: you know 

186.91 187.72 B: yes 

189.62 194.06 B: we're talking censorship yeah they should not be playing that but i you know 

190.81 191.71 A: yes 

193.67 194.58 A: (( yes )) 

194.16 198.51 B: yeah as far as books in the schools you know [mn] 

198.98 201.02 B: common sense common logic 

200.33 211.99 A: yeah like i remember they had i think tried to ban catcher in the rye 'cause there was like a racy page in it or something i mean something like that i don't necessarily agree with 

205.95 206.99 B: yeah 

208.89 209.87 B: right 

211.39 214.99 B: yeah well thorn birds had what three pages in it that was that way 

214.88 216.61 A: yeah oh i don't even know 

216.24 218.02 B: (( [laughter] )) 

217.26 225.89 A: but it's like you know but then again i mean there's a difference between something that might be considered classical or decent and then something that might be like downright pornographic you know 

225.55 227.41 B: right oh yeah i'd 

227.45 232.36 B: i'm a firm believer in no porno none no none no skin no nothing [laughter] 

229.12 230.77 A: oh yeah me neither 

231.73 234.54 A: yeah [laughter] exactly 

233.94 235.51 B: be a kid [laughter] 

235.09 246.06 A: that's true you know and but then again there is also that point that you have brought up that where do you draw the line you know w- where can you say okay well is an ankle okay well how about like a leg you know and 

240.43 241.32 B: yeah 

245.45 251.49 B: yeah and then how high up o- on a leg and and mini skirts and the short shorts and you know 

247.44 248.59 A: yeah 

251.16 255.39 A: yeah i don't even have cable in my house for that very reason i can't even 

255.75 260.57 A: deal with that stuff and my kids are already starting to get older and i don't need them to be [lipsmack] 

260.75 261.99 B: influenced 

260.84 261.74 A: (( you know )) 

262.26 267.90 A: h- h- america who's gonna you know choose whoever's wife or husband or whatever i can't even 

267.12 268.89 B: oh that is so stupid 

268.42 271.39 A: [sigh] tell me about it you know joe millionaire 

269.63 270.62 B: [sigh] 

271.26 275.03 B: yeah you could get a life [laughter] 

272.38 273.24 A: (( like what )) 

273.38 276.58 A: [laughter] i know totally what a bunch of junk you know 

276.15 278.01 B: (( [laughter] yeah definitely [mn] )) 

277.25 281.02 A: so i'm pretty glad they don't show that kind of stuff in school you know as far as 

280.64 281.56 B: right 

281.32 283.40 A: that sort of media goes i guess 

283.21 291.09 B: right yeah some of the well my daughter's so far been pretty good about what kind of books she wants to read and and um 

291.61 300.37 B: you know what what topics they are and and they're pretty pretty much ol- age appropriate some of them are geared more towards pre teen and early teen 

300.18 301.12 A: yeah 

300.51 304.23 B: and of course most of her people that she knows are 

304.26 308.54 B: pre teen early teens so that's why she i think is attracted to those kind of books 

307.94 309.93 A: yeah 

309.22 317.36 B: and [sigh] the teachers i should say our classroom teachers for these two have been pretty good on the books that they send home 

317.41 319.52 A: well that's good 

318.48 320.89 B: and what not um 

321.20 322.27 B: yeah 

322.71 323.65 A: so i'm w- 

322.72 326.31 B: so far i'd have to say they've they're doing an okay job [laughter] 

325.46 329.62 A: yeah my kids are so uncomplicated it's so nice right now you know 

329.22 330.28 B: (( yeah )) 

329.72 335.14 A: first grade and pre school [laughter] everybody tells me it gets harder you know 

331.26 332.90 B: (( [laughter] [laughter] )) 

334.75 340.58 B: yeah it does and everybody keeps telling me it's gonna get harder than what it is and it's like can it really [laughter] 

339.63 341.58 A: (( yeah well you know )) 

342.28 354.23 B: gotta teach 'em firm values now and and you know they don't see mom and dad reading inappropriate material so then they don't have the urge to read or see inappropriate material 

344.62 345.85 A: that's right 

353.39 364.14 A: yeah that's the one thing i try to really do with my kids is we spend a lot of time reading the bible and we go to church a lot and try to instill those kind of values because it's so hard to fight 

364.74 367.16 A: that's like just overwhelms 

367.60 368.48 A: (( you know )) 

368.19 369.48 B: yeah it is 

370.66 372.03 B: yeah i 

372.17 375.13 B: am trying to get a firmer grip on um 

375.14 379.00 B: religion and church uh with my children they don't know 

377.67 378.68 A: yeah 

379.13 382.63 B: the stories like i used to because i went to sunday school and 

381.90 383.28 A: yeah 

382.95 386.29 B: i mean i grew up in a small town about seven hundred people 

385.90 387.27 A: oh yeah 

386.67 390.53 B: you know and now we're living in a town of over three thousand people 

390.64 397.46 B: and umpteen different churches to pick from and and everybody has their own different way of doing 

393.75 394.96 A: yeah 

397.81 401.03 A: true everybody does have their own beliefs you know 

398.58 399.71 B: church 

400.62 404.86 B: yeah and it's like i haven't found my belief 

404.87 408.15 B: or maybe my belief isn't correct [laughter] you know what i mean 

406.77 415.21 A: yeah well to me you know and not to totally stray at all but th- you have to ask yourself if you believe in jesus 

414.78 415.75 B: right 

415.17 423.39 A: and then if you do believe in jesus then you have to decide to try to find a church that is as close to how he taught as possible 

422.76 423.65 B: right 

423.38 432.08 A: you know like a lot of churches they say they believe in jesus but then they do their own thing and stuff and that would be the only thing i could really speak intelligently about you know 

431.71 433.71 B: yeah [laughter] exactly 

433.12 436.05 A: you know so i don't know just check it out and you know 

435.96 444.09 B: yeah because then i would get appropriate material there as far as adults giving younger people appropriate material 

440.02 441.81 A: yeah oh absolutely 

443.47 445.36 A: yeah 

444.34 451.21 B: and you know like the other day they learned a nice story and and uh my daughter wanted to take her 

451.44 452.58 B: daily little 

452.91 455.41 B: daily reading bibles to school 

455.51 456.61 A: oh yeah 

455.96 460.81 B: she wanted tyler her sis- her brother to take it to school for their book read day 

461.23 469.00 B: and i really hesitated on sending it to school because of all the problems that are going on and i finally just said take it you know 

463.81 464.81 A: you know 

465.01 465.71 A: (( [mn] )) 

468.17 474.98 A: we did the same exact thing with c. j. he's been wanting to bring his bible to school and he's actually my stepson 

474.67 475.52 B: (( uh huh )) 

475.09 483.87 A: so i was like okay you know what you can bring it to school it's okay because you're not like distributing materials at school you know so you should be allowed to bring your own bible if you want 

483.65 484.67 B: right 

484.11 495.96 A: and his father kinda got a little upset like well i don't think the school would allow to have a bible in there and i don't know and you know so it was kind of a touchy thing but i think that as far as censorship goes 

495.82 502.08 A: if a student wants to bring a bible and read it during a free time or something i don't see a problem with that you know 

501.50 504.75 B: no i don't either i i um i would encourage it 

504.08 506.07 A: well yeah [laughter] you know 

504.93 511.70 B: you know they ought to get the bible and and god back in there there doesn't have to be one religion or another 

509.25 510.11 A: (( [sigh] )) 

511.27 517.71 A: yeah well you've you gotta figure our country was definitely founded on christians and a belief of god 

517.11 517.94 B: right 

517.60 528.57 A: there's absolutely no denying that and for them to try to say you can't say god in the pledge of allegiance in school that that might be considered unconstitutional is just horrendous to me 

523.76 524.55 B: right 

527.94 529.78 B: yeah it is [cough] 

529.64 537.26 A: you know we are one nation under god and there maybe some of them are muslim or whatever but we were founded on it and our money even says in god we trust 

530.05 531.01 B: and then 

536.91 538.38 B: right exactly 

538.86 542.56 B: you know and there there for the censorship part of it um 

539.00 539.81 A: (( so )) 

543.72 549.45 B: you know we wouldn't have the problem with censorship [laughter] if they just do it the right way the first time 

548.89 561.12 A: it's true you know and then all these people like you know for instance all the people with the pornography on the internet are hiding behind censorship that they have some sort of a right to shove this junk down our throats 

560.59 561.44 B: right 

561.12 566.38 A: you know and all these pob dobs and all this stuff and you know i i don't know to me 

566.52 574.06 A: we do have draw a line somewhere but i think that common sense is a good place to start you know not a bunch of you know 

574.02 582.04 A: litigation or whatever oh well if you say this then it applies to this and that i mean just common sense and not making it too complicated 

581.34 587.75 B: yeah exactly and then you have someone say well [lipsmack] whose common sense is the right common sense 

587.13 588.65 A: yeah well 

588.03 589.83 B: [laughter] 

589.19 592.64 A: there's always going to be somebody stirring it up i guess you know 

591.79 595.96 B: yeah they one of these deta- it takes all kinds to make the world go around 

595.35 596.56 A: that's true 

595.97 598.04 B: that's what i keep telling my kids [laughter] 

597.47 599.89 A: yeah and it's just it's kinda
