23.89 24.64 A: (( so )) 

28.83 32.32 A: okay so what do you think about this topic 

32.79 38.64 B: um i think that censors- censorship is um harmful i think that um 

38.91 40.60 B: and i think that 

41.09 45.89 B: that reading can't do anything but help and i feel that in 

46.10 51.71 B: in a private or a public setting as long as parents are involved it doesn't matter what the kids have mhm 

51.57 53.77 A: i agree a hundred percent a 

54.06 57.11 A: hundred percent i have three kids and 

57.31 64.09 A: i think that if the parents are okay with it then i don't think the schools should have anything to do with it 

63.49 65.29 B: i don't think so either 

65.15 70.18 A: and if they have any material that some people deem to be questionable 

70.30 72.36 A: then have it where 

72.77 78.42 A: each individual's parent can maybe sign a permission slip or something to that effect 

77.93 79.06 B: yeah 

78.90 80.95 A: so do you have children 

80.84 81.99 B: i have three 

82.33 83.43 A: how old are they 

83.40 92.60 B: well they're they're not children any more they're all ad- they're all adults at this point but it's a matter that i put them all through school and i i signed waivers for for all of them 

92.62 97.46 B: to be able to go into to the next level up because i think children should all stretch 

97.59 98.62 A: i do too 

97.82 106.84 B: i don't think that you should have to have any child bend to to learn i think they should all h- have everything a little bit out of their reach so they have to stretch to get it 

106.53 107.46 A: right 

107.37 108.73 B: (( [lipsmack] yeah right )) 

107.92 111.87 A: i agree i have a child in the third grade 

111.71 112.63 B: mhm 

112.30 114.61 A: that reads on an eighth grade level 

114.10 117.48 B: yeah that's where my kids are are over way advanced 

117.07 118.85 A: yeah and 

118.00 128.89 B: and my son was re- read the um the story for head start 'cause i was ill and i couldn't couldn't go out and play with him so i taught him how to play poker and how to read when he was two 

125.28 126.19 A: mhm 

129.27 130.52 A: that's awesome 

129.95 132.28 B: [laughter] he's he's very intelligent 

132.73 135.73 B: he was very easy to teach so [mn] [lipsmack] 

135.30 139.48 A: yeah i just i think they're trying to get too involved 

139.27 143.80 B: i think they are too i think government needs to step back from the family 

143.42 144.62 A: right 

144.70 145.80 B: (( i think they're )) 

144.98 145.79 A: they're 

145.91 148.90 A: putting in too much and taking away too many 

148.89 151.09 B: too many rights for parents 

149.87 153.61 A: right right too many rights too many freedoms 

152.85 153.72 B: yeah 

153.72 163.00 A: and i mean we send our children to school to learn and how can they learn everything that they need to learn to face the real world 

157.21 157.80 B: (( [mn] )) 

163.10 165.29 A: if the government's taking away 

165.52 167.86 A: one of the most important things i mean 

167.61 168.71 B: yeah 

168.07 172.53 A: i mean i wouldn't want a kindgartener reading about sex but you know 

171.00 172.30 B: yeah right 

172.73 174.06 B: i feel like 

174.07 181.16 B: i feel like uh aside from the fact that most kids don't wouldn't understand it if they did read it until they're ready to do it 

180.92 181.81 A: right 

181.63 189.65 B: i think that uh you know i think that kids learn on the learn at the rate that they're meant to to assimilate it 

189.26 191.24 A: right age appropriate 

190.64 191.62 B: (( yeah )) 

191.68 198.62 A: i agree i have a a nine year old boy an eleven year old girl and a fourteen year old boy 

192.33 193.29 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

198.38 199.25 B: yeah 

199.28 203.91 A: and you know kids are starting sexual activities earlier 

199.30 199.86 B: (( [mn] )) 

203.43 204.40 B: yes 

204.03 205.27 A: than they were 

205.14 206.14 B: mhm 

205.51 210.13 A: years ago and i would rather my children read the material 

206.21 207.09 B: yes 

209.80 210.72 B: mhm 

210.43 215.63 A: and have an idea of the sexually transmitted diseases they can catch 

212.25 214.28 B: what's going on [laughter] 

214.91 215.68 B: (( yeah mhm )) 

215.79 219.19 A: about pregnancy adoption abortion 

218.72 219.69 B: yeah 

219.68 227.36 A: you know all these things that could happen h._i._v. and whatnot than to have them go into it blindly 

222.93 223.89 B: yeah 

226.91 228.60 B: yeah that's the way i feel too 

228.71 239.47 B: i mean i don't think that that foul language is appropriate any place but it's a matter that you know if they they read it in a book it's not quite s- quite so shocking when it comes up in real life 

239.04 239.92 A: right 

239.81 243.80 B: and i 'cause you can always shut the book uh you can't always shut your ears 

243.23 244.27 A: right 

244.03 245.08 B: and it's 

244.47 249.91 A: and i don't think it's so much maybe the the shocking language if they would do it 

250.63 251.99 A: in more 

252.36 256.37 A: i guess you'd say clinical terms use the appropriate terms 

253.94 254.78 B: mhm 

255.73 256.69 B: yes 

257.00 258.32 A: and teach them 

258.40 260.67 A: right from wrong from day one 

260.30 269.07 B: i think so too i just i just think that as long as as you have people out there that want to take away your rights as a parent 

269.65 273.57 B: i think that the parents should decide i think as long as parents are involved 

273.59 278.44 B: then the kids will probably work out right but if they're not involved then the kids are gonna go wrong anyway 

278.08 280.99 A: right they're left on their own to do whatever 

279.54 280.31 B: (( yes )) 

280.45 281.31 B: yeah 

281.14 283.65 A: and that's where you have kids get involved 

283.72 285.69 A: in pornography 

285.32 288.76 B: yes drugs pornography all the other bad things 

287.55 288.45 A: right 

288.50 295.30 A: instead of sex ed- sex education they're getting into pornography and they're not learning the right thing 

293.97 302.26 B: yeah th- they're not learning the right stuff i mean my i was a foster parent and i had a twelve year old come in and tell my children 

302.34 307.64 B: with very bad language just what had happened to her in her household why she was taken out 

307.44 308.71 A: oh goodness 

308.28 310.77 B: and i'm sitting there i says and they says 

310.89 322.52 B: you know my daughter comes out with a string of foul language and says is this what really happens i says well i says number one we don't use that kind of language to describe anything i says and number two 

322.60 328.05 B: that should only happen between a- grown ups it should never happen between an adult and a child 

327.60 328.64 A: right 

328.19 332.11 B: i says now and i sat her down and told her all the right stuff 

332.13 345.01 B: and then told her all the stuff th- that wasn't supposed to go on and then you know and you know she was she was only like six and i mean you really don't expect to have a six year old learning this stuff from a twelve year old that shouldn't have known it in the first place 

339.04 339.95 A: goodness 

344.48 345.48 A: right 

345.51 349.11 B: and uh i'm sitting there and then i says well i says you know 

349.28 359.40 B: i says bad things happened to her i says this is not her fault this bad things happened to her but she's got you know i told her that you know i took the other child apar- 

359.47 364.20 B: apart and told her that this was not an appropriate thing for her to be saying 

364.45 373.58 B: uh that if she wanted to talk about that maybe she'd better talk to me first so that we could tell find out what she could say to the other kids because they weren't as old as she was 

373.46 374.43 A: right 

374.22 378.24 B: and that that way you know everybody was kind of kind of 

378.99 382.75 B: satisfied that way because she wanted to get get get it out 

382.98 390.76 B: but she i had to had to limit what she was saying and how she was saying it because it was appropriate for her to get it out 

390.70 391.58 A: right 

390.96 394.01 B: but it wasn't appropriate to get it out to another child 

393.60 394.55 A: right 

394.57 395.66 B: and 

395.06 395.89 A: we 

397.21 402.21 A: read a lot here at home and i really enjoy the true crime stories 

401.61 402.42 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

402.22 405.47 A: and i'm reading one now about a family in ohio 

405.64 408.16 A: where there were twelve children in the home 

407.69 408.60 B: mhm 

408.33 415.30 A: and as each of the daughters turned thirteen the dad married them 

415.08 416.51 B: oh my lord 

415.90 417.12 A: and then 

417.38 418.40 A: you know 

418.51 420.80 A: proceeded to have sex with them 

420.38 421.25 B: oh 

421.07 423.32 A: and my daughter picked up my book 

422.94 423.84 B: mhm 

423.52 430.92 A: and she you know thumbed through a few pages and and she came across a page where one of the the girls was describing to 

431.23 435.77 A: social workers about what their dad had done to them and she said mom 

433.72 434.74 B: mhm 

435.79 437.10 B: yeah 

436.26 442.33 A: and i you know i told her i said well honey number one this is why i ask you not to pick up my books 

441.98 443.01 B: mhm 

442.38 452.59 A: you know you have yours and i have mine and you know things like this happen in the world and it's unfortunate that they happen you know and she's been through uh 

444.47 445.08 B: (( mm )) 

450.19 451.31 B: mhm 

453.08 455.39 A: teen choice programs at school 

454.30 455.89 B: mhm yeah 

455.68 459.28 A: where they teach them about abstinence and things like that 

458.14 459.71 B: mhm yeah 

459.45 467.73 A: and i- how to respect themselves and and take care of themselves and i mean these were the things i had to sign permission slips for 

464.72 465.56 B: mhm 

466.84 467.61 B: yeah 

467.97 475.13 A: and out of i think fifteen twenty girls in her class there were only eight or ten of them that were allowed to go 

467.99 468.65 B: (( [mn] )) 

474.95 476.39 B: oh my goodness now 

475.88 477.10 A: and 

476.48 488.60 B: see that to me is something that should be automatic because they should learn about this 'cause i think keeping children blind about things like this just causes yeah i mean the first thing you know they're gonna be the ones that are com- coming up pregnant 

488.58 492.98 A: right and it's not gonna be such a curiosity thing 

488.92 490.27 B: it's kinda like when 

492.47 494.51 B: yeah it's like when you know 

494.51 499.41 B: all the girls in that went to catholic school and it was so regimented 

499.32 510.96 B: it was like they got to 'cause they didn't have a catholic high school they went all through all through grade eight they went to high school and everything all the knowledge was out there to find and they were 

510.97 513.70 B: all of the catholic girls were pregnant 

513.47 514.67 A: mhm 

514.23 515.56 B: i'm sitting here 

515.90 521.99 B: i says didn't didn't you learn about this no we didn't have sex education classes we didn't have this 

521.98 522.85 A: right 

522.24 530.61 B: the nuns just told us we shouldn't do this but they they said they had they they stopped us kissing so these girls weren't kissing anybody but they were doing everything else 

531.57 535.50 A: and with the private schools versus the public schools 

535.08 536.03 B: mhm 

536.07 541.37 A: any of the private schools that we have here in our area are christian schools 

540.80 541.65 B: mhm 

542.01 546.49 A: and there is no curriculum about sex education 

546.49 551.69 B: mhm i think that's a mistake because they have to live in the real world whether it's christian or not 

547.97 549.38 A: i i agree 

551.48 552.40 A: right 

552.52 556.36 A: and um you know in a christian family you wanna teach your child 

556.53 558.13 A: christian values 

557.53 558.37 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

558.39 564.14 A: but even the best family with the best intentions their child 

564.30 569.16 A: can be just as curious as a a family who doesn't practice religion 

568.78 569.84 B: that's true 

569.49 572.10 A: you know doesn't practice 

572.72 580.35 A: family get together type sit down let's have a conversation do you have questions is there anything i can answer for you 

575.57 576.39 B: (( mhm mhm )) 

581.57 584.43 A: it it i don't think it has anything to do with a 

584.84 588.46 A: a public or a private it's not allowed in any of 'em 

588.06 599.89 B: yeah and that's the way i feel that it everything within reason i i don't think that they should have hustler on the school shelves i think i think that's i mean that shouldn't even be 

596.75 597.88 A: right
