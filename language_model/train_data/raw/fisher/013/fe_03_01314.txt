37.04 37.81 A: anymore 

37.57 38.35 B: uh huh 

38.31 40.93 A: and i think when you're in close up places 

41.06 41.53 A: that 

42.02 42.45 A: it's 

43.10 44.30 A: really bothersome 

44.62 45.14 B: uh huh 

46.09 46.69 A: how do you feel 

50.47 50.98 A: mhm 

51.78 57.77 B: um i agree with you i think that we former smokers are the worst 

57.62 59.35 A: exactly 

60.28 63.42 B: um w- where do you live linda 

63.21 64.96 A: i live in illinois by chicago

66.64 67.20 A: oh 

68.00 68.75 A: oh okay 

68.67 71.29 B: and so we have um 

71.91 73.44 B: down here most 

73.56 74.67 B: um 

78.21 78.70 A: mhm 

82.40 83.69 B: uh with regard 

83.78 84.98 B: to setting up 

85.37 86.70 B: uh like are they putting up 

86.80 88.72 B: signs saying no smoking 

88.97 89.62 B: um 

89.92 97.48 B: now in the restaurants i'm not sure exactly what they're doing uh but whatever it is it can't be too much for me 

96.67 106.00 A: right exactly um around here they um they still have the you know non smoking areas um which 

106.46 107.96 A: is fine it seems like 

108.13 110.46 A: a lot of people don't smoke 

110.96 112.46 A: um in restaurants 

112.47 112.99 B: uh huh 

113.31 116.25 A: i know when we were just down in um 

116.41 117.84 A: the daytona area 

118.59 122.06 A: we went into a couple restaurants and they were all 

122.26 123.16 A: non smoking 

123.30 123.80 B: mhm 

124.15 124.80 A: um 

124.93 130.19 A: cause when i went in there to put our name i said you know and non smoking and she said we are all non smoking 

130.81 132.86 B: yeah and you said yay 

130.84 131.29 A: which wasn't 

131.41 132.28 A: which was nice 

132.63 133.22 A: yeah 

133.91 135.46 A: cause it's hard when you're trying to have a nice 

138.95 139.74 B: that's right 

143.44 145.09 B: that that's exactly right 

162.24 162.62 A: right 

162.76 163.28 A: yes 

166.88 168.99 B: but we just paid an amendment to our state cons- 

169.09 181.00 B: -tution saying that we that we had to have no smoking in our restaurants and in other places we can still have smoking in bars and that means places where the liquor bill 

188.78 192.64 B: uh in of the revenue of the um 

194.28 195.18 B: facility 

194.33 194.94 A: of the business 

195.12 195.82 A: yeah 

195.50 202.26 B: and so basically that means a a place can sell food but the majority of their food has to come from liquor sales 

202.12 203.31 A: oh okay that's 

202.62 204.97 B: and so that means a bar can still sell 

203.80 204.19 A: yeah 

209.39 209.84 A: right 

212.83 214.71 B: you can be a bar and still sell food 

215.01 216.77 B: but um a lot of people 

216.99 217.48 B: seem 

217.59 225.75 B: seem to like to drink and smoke and but they can still have a hamburger too or steak or whatever they want but that meant that restaurants 

219.61 219.92 A: right 

223.37 223.79 A: right 

225.99 229.56 B: where the majority of their revenue comes from food can't 

229.84 231.03 B: you can't smoke in there 

231.22 232.38 A: oh well that's 

232.62 233.58 A: that's a good one 

233.66 244.15 B: i think so i think so too mhm i think so too and i don't know exactly when that takes place i don't know if it's effective april one or may one but it's effective soon 

233.88 235.25 A: i like that yeah 

236.04 236.48 A: yeah 

244.01 244.84 A: huh 

244.39 247.77 B: mhm and so that's the way it's going to be all across florida 

247.71 248.42 A: wow 

248.41 248.77 B: mhm 

248.92 251.63 A: i we i haven't even been hearing anything um 

252.09 252.69 A: up here 

253.32 257.77 A: about any type of non smoking movement i know 

257.94 261.18 A: at one time they were trying to do like um 

261.72 267.01 A: even in outdoor stadiums and stuff like that in like in soldier field and stuff like that 

267.50 269.50 A: they wanted to at one time make that 

269.66 275.40 A: uh non smoking which i think is kind of hard and you're outdoors um 

276.58 278.80 A: you know at least you have some air going around 

278.67 279.28 B: uh huh 

279.22 283.36 A: you're not indoors which i don't think you should put a ban on smoking 

283.55 284.90 A: in outdoor facilities 

293.97 294.31 B: that 

294.49 298.12 B: relates to beer but you can't smoke in that section either 

297.84 299.78 A: oh that's nice too 

299.55 304.24 B: i think it is because you don't want people um 

300.62 301.12 A: yes 

304.33 307.17 B: knocking their ashes down the back of your neck 

306.97 307.28 A: right 

307.79 308.51 A: exactly 

308.58 310.54 B: and i think that's something to consider 

310.49 310.92 A: yeah 

311.31 320.64 A: well i know when we we go down to the daytona five hundred and i where we used to sit i had a man every year i we you know we had the same seats and he had the same seats and 

320.76 325.20 A: he never stopped smoking and i was always right next to him and 

322.55 323.27 B: uh huh 

325.53 327.30 A: by the time i was 

327.82 332.74 A: by the time we left i was covered in ashes you know just blowing into my face and 

330.46 331.06 B: uh huh 

332.09 332.60 B: mhm 

332.93 333.33 B: mhm 

333.18 333.82 A: couldn't take it 

334.11 340.99 B: well i think this is for for those of us who are non smokers i think that's a drawback it makes us smell bad 

340.88 341.24 A: yeah 

350.17 350.52 A: uh 

350.19 350.60 B: now 

372.85 374.92 B: other solution (( )) i thought 

375.07 382.45 B: her breath smells bad her hair her hands smell so bad and i noticed it a lot because i'm a non smoker 

382.29 383.24 A: exactly 

383.15 394.32 B: and i thought oh your hands smell so bad and and your hair smells so bad and your clothes smell so bad so i thought okay this this ban about smoking isn't so bad after all 

388.61 389.04 A: yeah 

405.70 407.62 A: cause that smells like it 

407.83 410.52 B: did do you work outside the home 

408.04 408.54 A: you know 

410.71 411.27 A: yes i do 

411.40 416.09 B: um do peop- um is there no smoking in your workplace 

415.85 416.50 A: oh yes 

416.98 417.32 A: yes 

417.48 424.89 B: mhm um do smokers go outside do do workers in your workplace who smoke do they go outside to smoke 

424.34 426.41 A: actually we have no one that smokes 

426.80 428.51 B: oh isn't that lucky 

428.22 429.26 A: no one 

429.80 431.14 A: yeah it's really nice 

431.35 439.46 B: well i see people um i no longer work but i see people who stand outside their buildings and smoke 

439.37 440.16 A: mhm 

439.68 447.41 B: and i always think gee when i worked i used to carry the load for the workers who went outside and smoked 

447.17 447.90 A: exactly 

447.93 450.77 B: and that can cause resentment 

450.66 451.02 A: yep 

451.00 454.74 B: um the loss time costs money to the business 

454.53 454.99 A: mhm 

455.07 460.08 B: uh so i think there are other um advantages 

460.19 461.03 B: to 

461.31 462.57 B: banning smoking 

462.66 463.21 A: right 

462.83 465.73 B: banning it altogether 

465.43 470.41 A: i think that they should um i used to work at a place where um it was just 

470.51 472.70 A: two of us and 

472.83 473.56 A: um 

473.87 476.94 A: the one girl smoked and i didn't and she would go out 

477.17 478.07 A: all the time 

478.83 481.41 A: and have a cigarette i think she should have went out 

481.71 486.33 A: at designated breaks or whatever so whenever she came back from a cigarette 

484.30 484.80 B: mhm 

486.48 495.01 A: break i say well i'm going to take my cigarette break you know and go do whatever i wanted to do you know go stand outside or you know 

492.37 494.49 B: that's good linda 

494.71 495.64 B: are you 

495.14 496.67 A: so 

495.76 496.25 B: mhm 

496.68 497.07 B: mhm 

497.52 498.14 A: it was 

498.46 499.19 A: i i 

499.76 507.89 A: thought it was but then the next thing was when i started um i was breastfeeding so i would go and 

508.23 511.67 A: pop and so i would take that time so then you know 

508.84 509.80 B: yes uh huh 

511.79 514.67 A: she would say well we're kind of equal now you know 

513.70 514.49 B: uh huh 

514.71 515.24 B: uh huh 

515.42 515.82 A: so
