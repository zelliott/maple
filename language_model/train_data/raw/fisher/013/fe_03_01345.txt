6.47 8.33 A: my name is mark newell 

8.12 9.81 B: mark where are you from

13.68 14.79 A: uh-huh 

15.19 17.96 B: [mn] so what do you think about this topic 

18.05 18.98 B: mark 

19.54 21.37 A: what what is the topic again 

20.47 22.82 B: [laughter] censorship 

22.54 25.36 A: censorship in priv- in public schools 

23.84 37.65 B: oh first i don't know first they said censorship and then they [cough] said about do you think that private and public schools have the right to tell students what to read so i guess 

38.13 49.44 A: is that what it was what what they should read or that that there should be censorship of certain books for what schools could ask their students to read it seems like a distinction 

39.11 40.40 B: i guess that 

47.59 48.58 B: i 

48.82 51.02 B: yeah i think you're right 

50.96 52.18 A: i'm not sure 

51.87 58.61 B: i'm not sure myself because first she said censorship and then she went on about public and private schools ah 

53.03 54.49 A: what shall we choose 

58.66 61.79 B: is this your first day on this line 

61.22 62.51 A: it is 

61.95 64.48 B: it is well [mn] 

64.77 72.40 B: yesterday it was the same topic so [laughter] and i spoke with a gentleman out in ah texas 

73.33 78.81 B: but yesterday just said censorship now they're talking about schools i mean 

78.27 79.14 A: (( ha )) 

79.71 80.75 B: well 

79.91 82.03 A: so we we should just choose one 

81.69 83.11 B: [laughter] 

82.94 84.24 A: it sounds like 

83.64 85.58 B: yeah yeah well 

86.70 88.54 B: (( s- so ah )) 

88.30 90.90 A: so the two options are 

91.05 97.95 A: sh- should there be a should there be distinction right well 

96.36 97.27 B: right 

99.09 102.64 A: (( [sigh] so weird i've got to tell you [laughter] )) 

102.19 104.36 B: yeah it sounded like 

105.18 111.25 B: should the the um school board or what have you have the right to 

112.49 119.38 B: tell students what books to read in the public and private schools that's the way i took it but of course i could be wrong 

117.05 117.94 A: mhm 

118.78 120.32 A: well let's go with that one 

121.08 122.30 B: okay 

122.39 125.67 B: [laughter] i mean as far 

122.88 124.33 A: [laughter] 

126.80 134.31 B: i don't know if you call that censor well it's a form of censorship i guess but if you're going to a private school and ah 

134.95 141.44 B: your parents are paying you know quite a bit of money to send you there i guess ah 

143.01 145.40 B: you have to go along with the program 

147.40 149.62 A: what if the parents disagree 

150.03 155.17 B: [laughter] well that's that's a good one that's true um 

155.48 162.43 A: i mean i i i guess i would be in favor of in general 

162.68 167.53 A: the idea that the students have the students should 

167.56 173.13 A: if they can articulate why they don't want to read it why it's inappropriate or offensive or 

173.37 174.34 B: right 

173.75 180.55 A: something then it makes sense and they should propose something else that's somehow equivalent in its nature 

180.78 186.04 B: right right well if something pops up in the middle of the semester and 

186.14 190.73 B: i mean i remember a few months back they are pulling certain books out of schools now 

190.96 193.63 B: you know i didn't follow it too much 

194.73 201.84 B: you know er like catcher in the rye at some schools and this but i'm not sure if 

198.42 199.43 A: uh-huh 

201.96 203.25 B: the topic 

203.41 208.14 B: (( well let's just go on what we are going with [laughter] )) 

205.93 206.97 A: yeah 

208.36 209.70 B: but ah yeah 

208.49 214.20 A: [laughter] so that's my feeling is i'm i'm i guess i'm kind of 

214.18 217.04 B: it should be up to the student and i guess 

214.34 215.15 A: (( liberal )) 

216.65 228.78 A: make their choices they know what they want they know what they hopefully they know what they need there's some sense of responsibility what's that called that moral responsibility that you're not just shirking 

219.02 220.14 B: true 

228.92 237.23 A: the responsibility of having to stretch yourself to learn to to write a paper on something that seems difficult you know 

237.61 238.67 B: right 

237.85 244.97 A: that's the goal of the book isn't it that's the goal of a reading exercise in the school is these are typically well written 

245.71 255.01 A: classics that that provide some sense of some place of education or some good stories there's 

255.03 261.62 A: relatively a large number of things that could meet that requirement 

260.58 274.79 B: that's true well i would just think more along the lines of ah majority would rule but [mn] i don't know what certain ah school boards are doing across the country i haven't been following that too much 

267.12 268.08 A: mhm 

275.31 283.25 A: you know i get i get i do get very nervous about any sort of school boards making decisions about 

283.91 298.18 A: what's appropriate and what's not appropriate because you can get communities that might be perhaps more isolated that aren't giving exposure to topics that otherwise could be very valuable to a to a student 

297.57 303.03 B: right well i'm against also most forms of censorship i mean er 

304.16 307.82 B: isn't that how the nazis started out 

307.22 308.03 A: (( yep )) 

307.90 311.60 B: that and they took away the guns from the people 

312.61 315.56 B: and this is where we got well 

314.95 319.50 A: yeah there are lots of examples of it i mean there's quite a bit of censorship that's still 

319.64 325.27 A: you know they do you have banned books there are a lot of banned books still in the united states 

325.06 326.29 B: that's true 

326.78 328.10 A: and ah 

328.82 333.82 A: the government makes different government's involved in some of those 

333.91 336.00 B: yeah 

334.90 344.73 A: but not all of 'em and others are just more state banned some some coalition has come together and lobbied the state government to say these books shouldn't be 

344.85 348.35 A: matter of fact i think they even go as far and i don't have any 

348.84 353.92 A: this isn't particularly a topic i've studied but it seems like there's even 

354.51 364.45 A: text books that get banned because they provide a perspective on history that's not in accordance with a local or state 

364.72 366.07 B: right right 

365.28 366.87 A: group 

366.17 371.33 B: right well it seems like the government's in everything today they're into too many things 

372.09 374.46 B: so i don't know the answer 

375.45 380.12 B: i don't know it seems like the whole world's getting worse all the time 

379.79 385.92 A: mhm so what would be the ideal what what would be your ideal in this scenario 

386.22 387.25 B: (( [laughter] )) 

388.13 397.83 B: that's a good question if i knew exactly what the what the topic was but we're going along where we're at so i would just think ah 

399.54 402.29 B: like you had mentioned ah 

402.31 408.97 B: if this is something the students want you know and they can ah articulate themselves in a 

409.24 411.44 B: in a fashion that ah 

412.29 413.69 B: would let the 

414.61 416.65 B: teachers or what have you know 

418.71 421.55 B: where they stand i think if they're 

422.58 424.80 B: they should be able to choose 

425.23 426.88 A: mhm 

427.47 428.18 A: (( mm )) 

429.16 430.88 A: that's that's 

431.24 434.88 A: i'm just trying to think back to when i was in school and how 

435.97 440.94 A: you know there were books that were kind of not very interesting for whatever reason you know 

440.80 442.28 B: right 

441.92 443.81 A: that 

444.08 450.27 A: that i didn't like reading but often by the time i finished writing the paper 

450.09 451.79 B: you got interested in it 

451.04 461.90 A: i got really into it and there was all this subtle information and very useful and i often had these really profound kind of you know because there was the last minute the night before 

461.93 466.98 A: experiences where i wanted to write at the bottom of the paper thank you so much for forcing me to 

462.03 463.10 B: (( mhm )) 

466.99 471.88 A: read and write about this book i've i've got a lot out of it i've learned a lot thank you 

470.96 481.42 B: well you have a good point which is true you know a lot of things are boring or don't appeal to you and then once you get in it it may turn out to be something entirely different 

480.83 482.09 A: yeah 

481.49 483.49 B: and something that you enjoy 

483.75 484.89 B: so 

485.03 487.18 B: it's a tough one to call i 

486.92 488.16 A: yeah 

487.57 491.72 B: mean i went to mostly catholic schools you know what i mean and 

491.15 494.52 A: yeah well there's an example of probably you were exposed to 

494.59 496.82 A: only material of a certain type 

496.39 503.33 B: yeah you had religion i had to go to church each morning before class well that was in the sixties 

503.49 507.01 B: i'm probably older than you i will be well i'm forty eight 

506.63 508.41 A: mhm i'm thirty five 

508.07 509.10 B: uh-huh 

510.17 516.57 B: but i mean go in there at that time you knew you know what you were up against and what 

516.07 517.18 A: yeah 

516.63 518.68 B: you know what's going to be taught 

518.87 521.34 B: and there was never no where 

525.13 526.94 B: no where 

527.20 528.51 B: i don't know what 

530.41 532.81 B: no problem really 

533.76 535.49 B: 'course back then 

535.66 538.79 B: you know they had a paddle those nuns would whack you 

538.52 539.77 A: (( mhm yeah )) 

539.07 541.25 B: but ah [laughter] 

540.87 546.92 A: [laughter] did you feel like you had a choice could you say no i don't want to read this for whatever reason 

547.02 554.90 B: no no i didn't no what they gave you to read you read and you didn't have much of a choice no 

551.48 552.82 A: yeah 

555.41 562.70 B: of course they're bringing well like you had to wear a uniform this and that i now there's even public schools where 

562.87 570.71 B: they're telling you to wear uniforms you know that's another one to call whether you're for it or against it 

565.10 566.26 A: mhm 

570.00 574.65 A: it is it's an interesting one i could make arguments probably on both sides 

574.28 582.84 B: yeah that's the that's the thing about it i mean there's two sides you could always make points with either side so it's a hard hard one to call 

582.48 583.54 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

584.77 590.05 B: i mean yes you lose somewhat of your freedom to express yourself and what have you 

590.38 594.24 B: but then again you don't have kids 

594.25 598.89 B: you know making fun of other kids because you might be able to dress a little better 

599.12 599.89 B: you know every
