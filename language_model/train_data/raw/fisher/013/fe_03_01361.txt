446.54 447.34 A: right 

448.00 456.19 B: and i let them watch that kind of thing but it was up to the parents to censor at home what they didn't want them to watch 

456.19 465.40 A: well since they have gotten a little older i have uh bought them books myself and given 'em to them and it's books their mother had as a child 

465.45 469.04 A: identical books like the nancy drew series 

468.83 471.65 B: (( i loved those i grew un on those things )) 

469.73 483.83 A: oh yeah i've got that that set the old ones that were my daughter's i've still got 'em and i bought some for my grandkids and i told 'em read these you know it's all fiction but it's an adventure for your mind 

475.48 476.10 B: (( [sigh] )) 

480.82 481.95 B: mhm 

483.86 485.61 A: it makes you think 

484.00 485.05 B: yeah 

485.91 491.50 A: it gives you an outlet to go into another world and forget about your everyday cares 

492.08 498.02 A: and that's what children need yeah it makes them think and see if they don't sit and think and learn 

492.12 494.28 B: well it gives them creativity 

498.29 504.97 A: they're just they're just gonna be kids you know when they get older they won't have any knowledge they won't be able to 

501.17 502.02 B: mhm 

505.24 506.18 A: uh 

506.60 508.64 A: distinguish thoughts 

508.63 509.67 B: yeah 

511.27 520.13 A: i read voraciously when i was growing up i had so many books around here it was unreal now i listen to books my eyes ain't that great [laughter] 

520.46 523.66 B: well but i think children should have 

523.68 529.83 B: you know the opportunity to hear and to read and to see 

530.32 531.28 B: (( you know )) 

531.30 532.83 B: within reason 

532.76 533.75 A: right 

533.78 539.90 B: anything and everything that is available to them that is appropriate for their you know age 

539.78 540.88 A: correct 

540.89 542.17 B: and then 

540.93 548.24 A: you have some guidelines you can't give 'em access to everything across the board you gotta you have some commonsense 

545.73 547.45 B: right but then you know 

548.04 551.38 B: but then mom and dad can always come back and say 

551.43 557.16 B: you know now those are alternatives but we believe this 

558.55 565.80 B: and that's the foundation for the religion that's the foundation for politics that's a foundation for 

565.95 572.16 B: anything else you're not telling them your friends are wrong because they go to a different church 

572.21 573.29 A: that's correct 

572.48 576.43 B: your friends are wrong because they believe anything else 

576.37 577.50 A: that's right 

577.31 582.21 B: this is what we believe those are just alternatives 

582.82 588.72 A: well the united states is a melting pot of everybody and you have to have an open mind 

588.78 591.62 A: and that goes with books and literature and everything else too 

592.04 593.34 B: i agree 

593.09 598.25 A: and no two people are gonna think alike if they did this would be a very boring world 

598.51 599.89 B: oh wouldn't it though
