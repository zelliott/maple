0.31 2.59 A: (( hey this is ramel hello )) 

2.72 5.08 B: hey this is kronjit singh 

6.33 7.30 B: yes 

7.46 9.75 A: hey what what the topic was 

9.38 15.28 B: uh if we think sm- uh banning smoking in public places is a good idea i think it's a good idea 

14.73 24.28 A: [laughter] in public places i don't know i don't know if i really think it's a good idea i mean i mean actually yeah because i can't stand the smoke but 

24.27 34.03 A: no actually i'm with you [laughter] now that i really think about it because i you try to start to say they can't smoke anywhere but where will they smoke i guess they should smoke in their own private areas you know what i'm saying like 

34.19 37.85 A: 'cause smoking is bad secondhand and everything 

35.74 36.98 B: yeah 

37.04 39.97 B: it's pretty bad i agree with the same thing 

39.66 42.71 A: yeah that is true so i wonder why they haven't done that yet 

41.89 47.14 B: do you think uh they also asked if you think those quit line and all those things work 

47.50 48.70 A: quick line 

48.28 53.05 B: like um those campaigns they have on t._v. like true dot com 

52.25 55.83 A: oh true that it they they asked if it does do they work 

55.13 58.24 B: yeah or if if that's a good idea 

57.89 69.99 A: i think it's a real good idea i think they're a great idea i'm glad they're doing them because now it makes people really think you know what i'm saying it really makes people be like okay wow is this really happening you know and it's like it really is happening so 

68.95 79.69 B: yeah i think it gives uh good information to people that they don't know you know like true gives all those facts that are like that take you like off your feet and it's pretty cool that they do that 

79.72 85.11 A: yeah like the babies like you really don't know like you really didn't know about the babies um 

85.16 97.93 A: saying like okay secondhand smoke makes your baby smaller or something like that how they had smaller ones and bigger ones and how people they they were saying that um people are what did they say oh the how the government was hiding a lot of things 

97.24 98.55 B: yeah 

98.14 104.25 A: and i mean that that that really makes a significant difference man in putting that out there i mean it's just little things that people might not know 

104.54 112.23 A: now the marijuana commercials i don't know [laughter] i think those may be a little extreme what do you think 

109.83 118.97 B: i i haven't i don't remember them oh yeah the marijuana commercials i yeah but i don't think that was related to true or smoking so 

118.60 119.90 A: (( oh okay )) 

119.45 126.25 B: yeah th- those were kind of like but they were they were still effective i think in that like you know it really caught me by surprise 

125.69 128.78 A: yeah it definitely did did catch my attention 

127.15 127.97 B: and it 

128.30 132.60 B: it lo- it left like a shocking image in your mind so it was pretty cool 

132.10 135.78 A: yeah well what else are we supposed to talk about that's it yeah 

135.42 136.73 B: i think so 

136.55 144.57 A: that's that's a bad that's a topic that you can't really talk too much about especially if two people agree on it but i mean i think really though that smoking um 

144.38 156.12 A: yeah we i mean smoking's just bad i mean have it bars and all that stuff and and how they have it in um restaurants and stuff like how they you know even on planes how they sep- separate people and say okay smoking section non smoking section 

155.76 156.69 B: yeah 

156.07 160.70 A: no cut it out period because that smoke still travels over to us anyway you know 

160.12 164.92 B: it definitely does do you smoke no right obviously not [laughter] 

162.55 169.80 A: no no no no no yeah exactly and it travels over to us and it it gets in your hair it gets in your clothes that's not cool 

169.96 171.21 B: yeah 

170.67 179.21 A: so it's definitely bad so how long are we supp- we supposed to sit here and talk and then hang up or [laughter] is this your first time doing this one 

174.67 177.47 B: i i have no idea [laughter] 

178.69 179.80 B: yes 

179.34 184.60 A: oh okay mine too [laughter] all the other ones i haven't been able to do so 

184.61 196.43 A: and i i didn't really get to hear the topic man i heard it but i didn't really get to hear it so by my clock here it looks like i got five more minutes we're supposed to keep talking on here [laughter] okay um 

192.73 193.94 B: (( oh man )) 

196.30 199.71 A: if they were to have some smoking places where would we have 

200.52 207.39 B: like you mean i i was confused like do they mean like ban smoking in public areas or or like 

208.19 210.05 B: ban 'em in like 

210.71 213.24 B: in like stadiums and stuff you know 

210.97 211.74 A: (( it [mn] )) 

213.37 214.89 A: i think if if 

213.79 216.32 B: and like subway stations and 

215.88 223.85 A: you let me if you let me speak my mind i would definitely say if they asked for my opinion let me speak it i would definitely say that 

224.51 227.86 A: yeah ban it everywhere i mean for real restaurants 

228.20 232.47 A: public places bathrooms i mean all that stuff planes 

232.97 238.45 A: make smoking like you know what i think the only place that'd be good is airports like where they have 

238.74 242.73 A: you know have you ever seen the airports where they have those suctions and it sucks it up 

241.23 242.19 B: mhm 

242.53 257.36 A: that's the only place that they stuff like that unless you have like a place like that but even outside like outside walking that bothers me you walk by and you're sitting at a at a corner just across the street and somebody's smoking it's like ugh you know but that is free space but 

247.88 249.07 B: (( i know )) 

256.74 269.08 B: yeah i don't know how that's gonna settle well with the general public i mean i'm i'm i'd rather see smoking banned in public places but like it might be too much of like a socialist movement [laughter] if we did that 

259.78 261.62 A: (( i don't know either )) 

269.17 270.69 A: (( oh how you figure )) 

270.46 281.09 B: uh just 'cause like i don't know like we shouldn't i don't think the government should like intrude on everyone's privacy like th- to that extent that they can't smoke outside of like a building you know 

281.30 288.65 A: i mean they do it with other things they do that with uh marijuana they do that and they they claim it as being legal but some people say it's not so 

288.58 294.55 A: people do it in hidden terms you know what i'm saying same thing with drinking i mean drink is actually put out there but people still drinking it in their own home 

294.37 299.00 A: so if it's something bad and they know it's something i think the government basically realizes that 

298.79 302.46 A: smoking is bad and people are starting to realize that it's bad 

300.08 301.40 B: (( mm )) 

302.26 317.25 A: so you realize it's bad but you know that it's such a strong instinct and part of america and you can't really just say okay everybody get rid of it or we're about to charge you know more i mean that's what they gotta do either make a tax for it a special tax for it or make a higher fee for it now or something but 

313.38 314.79 B: mhm 

317.30 323.73 A: i mean that's really you can't you can't um i mean there you actually can i figure you know do that because 

324.41 338.35 A: why not i mean should they i mean we we're able to have drinks everywhere we're able to do other things in hidden places as well as being out on the scene so it's like i say go ahead and um ban it you know what i'm saying [laughter] for real if it's possible ban it i mean people are going to 

337.13 339.11 B: if it's possible though but 

338.32 344.23 A: yeah people are always gonna speak and have their opinions and say oh yeah we shouldn't do this and we shouldn't do that but i mean 

344.71 347.36 A: (( i mean that )) 

345.34 352.20 B: i know but uh th- th- there's such a huge public like there's such a huge portion of the u._s. public like that 

351.68 352.92 A: smokes 

352.31 361.95 B: that smokes so i don't know how that's gonna settle well but i agree too but i don't know if i wanna go that far as saying like they should ban it like they have marijuana 

353.91 356.05 A: yeah 

362.47 370.86 A: i think so i mean not ban it but just stop it though i mean it's like it's a drug you know it's a drug that's no use 

370.84 378.01 A: no positive use [laughter] tell me the positive i mean besides having people that are addicted to it cope with it i mean it's it's no use for it 

377.69 378.68 B: that's true 

378.05 379.07 A: so 

379.42 385.07 A: i mean if if it's no use for it then i mean why are we uh we do we have it it's an addiction 

383.08 384.00 B: so you 

384.78 387.74 B: you're saying make it illegal or make uh 

387.50 400.56 A: i mean i don't i i guess that i don't wanna say make it illegal but i don't know it's kinda like drinking like i really people like to drink i drink but still drinking's a drug you know look how many problems it's caused a lot of people die and stuff like that it's like 

401.33 406.94 A: make it make it like harder to use or harder to get or harder to you know um 

407.55 408.11 A: (( [mn] )) 

408.18 419.63 A: uh my microwave uh make it harder to have access you know what i'm saying accessibility to it you know or something tax it make people who really want it pay for it that's what i mean you know what i 

418.75 423.38 B: o- okay so you like you wanna limit it as much as possible pretty much 

422.73 427.16 A: mean yeah basically if you try to limit it at least i mean just exactly it 

427.56 433.12 A: would be great if you could just limit it you know but um you know that's that's the problem right there limiting 

433.23 434.35 A: so 

433.85 441.00 B: i think it's very difficult to monitor something like smoking ban- banning smoking in like public areas is like be like a park 

439.29 442.38 A: it'd make people be a black market yeah 

441.37 448.64 B: yeah like a park you know if you can't just if somebody goes in the corner and starts smoking like it it'd be hard to monitor that anyways 

449.20 451.30 A: you said if someone goes to a park and what 

450.90 462.20 B: well like if someone smokes like at the corner of a building like you know who's gonna monitor it and who's gonna like charge them with doing something wrong you know just can't have like police everywhere 

464.02 469.32 A: yeah that is true i mean that's i think that's what it would turn into it would turn into like a big um 

469.61 480.31 A: black underground market [laughter] of cigarettes got some cigarettes got some cigarettes for you and people already do that now think about a bus i just matter of fact just today i walked by downtown and um 

472.96 473.99 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

480.13 488.31 A: and by some bus stations and they the guy was like i got two newports for i think fifty cents or something like that two for a dollar or something i was like what 

487.84 488.97 B: [laughter] 

488.18 498.04 A: newports i mean cigarettes i was like come on man and that's what it could be there's people who just ask like have you got can i bum a cigarette you know or you got a cigarette and it'd be just like that too man 

498.00 509.61 A: but the thing is it i mean i guess if they just had well then it's that that'd be real hard but if it was probable i'd say make it hard to get you know have access to 'em man 

509.82 511.17 A: for real [noise] 

511.95 512.75 B: yeah 

512.78 513.71 B: i think it's 

512.93 514.67 A: someone's huh 

514.24 515.63 B: (( what were you saying )) 

515.42 516.79 A: (( no go ahead go ahead you )) 

516.40 518.77 B: i was gonna say i think we've done ten minutes 

518.76 530.12 A: i'm at mine's just now hit ten minutes and what i was just about to say it's hard to talk on this topic for ten minutes that's what i was just about to say on this one i'm a i'm a person that talks but this one here is kinda hard to talk about that topic so 

518.85 520.21 B: [laughter] but 

523.60 524.48 B: yeah 

530.04 534.04 A: yeah looks like it's ten minutes so if it's not i guess they can call us back i guess 

534.43 535.28 A: (( so )) 

535.32 538.92 B: so like do we hang up do we stay on or do we 

535.95 537.09 A: you ready to go 

538.94 551.46 A: i don't know dude i really don't know actually it's been ten minutes twenty two seconds twenty three seconds [noise] twenty four since no since they i answered the phone so i don't know yeah if i don't know if we're supposed to [noise] 

544.31 546.26 B: since we started talking or 

547.87 548.81 B: okay 

550.42 553.87 B: well maybe we just wanna wait for like a minute and a half or something 

553.16 554.86 A: yeah 

555.62 557.56 B: right so you never smoked in your life 

555.97 557.76 A: (( yeah )) 

557.73 565.50 A: uh i have [laughter] my father smokes actually and i think my father smoking that's a really i mean i used to always be like man yeah i can smoke and 

565.50 573.68 A: the crazy thing is that like that smoke has something to do with us you know what i mean it's secondhand you're making my life bad because you have a habit you know 

572.54 573.80 B: (( yeah that's true )) 

573.85 575.97 A: ain't that messed up though you know what i mean 

575.65 577.34 B: i think so too [laughter] 

577.10 588.83 A: i mean that's not cool so it's like thinking about that it's like the same thing for people who are sitting in a restaurant who are sitting there smoking and the smoke comes over to my side anyway and they're like okay um 

589.64 594.81 A: you know i'm not try- i'm handling my addiction and my my habit but it's coming to you 

594.91 599.89 B: yeah especially at like bars and clubs when you go in 'cause they don't even have like smoking non
