416.03 417.96 B: [laughter] 

419.43 430.91 B: yeah we don't get it actually kinda drives some people crazy because it's it's just sort of gray and rainy all winter and it's not really cold and it's not really hot but it i think it makes people kind of 

430.78 431.96 A: depressed 

430.81 442.35 B: you know they get bored yeah and i was mostly raised here so i'm kinda used to it but um when the sun does shine you realize how much you missed it yeah and so it's it's uh 

432.09 433.15 A: yeah 

434.59 435.54 A: mhm 

438.32 440.23 A: how nice it is yes 

441.24 444.45 A: yeah that's really true i really appreciate the sunshine 

444.19 446.38 B: yeah yeah and 

445.27 448.07 A: and your your spirits are raised immediately 

446.91 450.69 B: definitely you feel like you can do much more and you have more energy 

449.90 452.22 A: yeah yeah you're happier 

450.85 452.18 B: almost almost like 

452.57 455.68 B: almost wanna go walking every night [laughter] 

452.67 453.58 A: yeah 

454.66 458.40 A: hey that's back to the subject here [laughter] 

456.28 463.17 B: [laughter] no i don't even know how much we supposed to stick to the subject or if they're just trying to give us uh give us a topic to 

459.99 462.40 A: i don't think it matters [laughter] 

463.28 469.52 B: talk about so that we'll talk or if it's a topic that they really want us to talk about that particular thing i don't know 

464.74 465.97 A: yeah 

469.25 472.24 A: yeah i don't think it matters either but uh 

471.03 475.97 B: oh well that's good because i can talk i can just talk [laughter] 

474.20 479.00 A: yeah so actually what they're doing is they're just taking all the participants and matching them up 

476.74 477.59 B: uh-huh 

478.89 480.14 B: oh 

479.60 480.77 A: is that what they're doing 

480.50 484.18 B: yeah i guess so i mean when i i got the phone call 

484.21 487.56 B: and the computer asked me if i 

487.61 492.94 B: would want to do it now and i said yes and then i was on hold for a while while they looked for you i guess 

492.55 503.94 A: i see okay yeah that happened to me the first time i was on hold for a while but i was thinking that i was talking to someone who was hired to do this but i guess what they're doin- just doing is having the participants talk among each other 

493.48 494.51 B: yeah 

496.77 497.67 B: uh-huh 

503.47 504.76 B: yeah 

504.09 508.10 A: and then among themselves and then just recording it probably 

506.16 507.18 B: yeah 

507.64 510.55 B: probably i'm no they are recording it for sure 

510.11 511.73 A: oh i would assume so 

511.06 513.60 B: yeah how did you find out about it 

513.49 514.62 A: on the internet 

514.30 515.68 B: yeah 

514.97 523.57 A: yeah i um let's see how did i get this speech study i think i'm a mystery shopper too and i think it uh came through on some of the information 

519.78 520.71 B: mhm 

523.65 528.91 A: about the mystery shopping on some of the message boards i think that's where it came from 

526.79 530.14 B: oh well i don't know what that is what mystery shopping is i don't what 

529.55 532.10 A: mystery shopping is basically where you um 

532.18 541.90 A: you'll go you'll get an assignment like maybe go to a burger king or go to a um a pet store or a clothing store or whatever restaurant or something and um 

540.46 542.26 B: (( that is oh )) 

541.97 550.41 A: you are a shopper you sho- you buy and then you fill out a form about you know what did they say to you and what was the person wearing and um 

543.14 544.62 B: (( right )) 

546.96 548.46 B: yeah 

549.05 550.09 B: (( mhm )) 

550.54 555.09 A: uh did they try to upsell you and how clean was the bathroom and that kind of thing 

554.56 558.03 B: i know and how that you mention that i have heard of that yes 

557.37 562.05 A: yeah yeah so i do that and i think that's probably how i heard how'd you hear about it 

558.58 559.73 B: so um 

561.76 575.05 B: oh i'm in the i'm my department at school is i'm in linguistics and uh a girl a girl in our department another a fellow student of mine she heard about it through i'm not sure maybe even the i'm 

567.07 567.70 A: (( mm )) 

575.10 582.33 B: not sure how she heard about it but it is sort of linguistically related i guess and with uh voice maybe voice recognition stuff and uh 

578.29 579.77 A: oh it would be yeah 

581.44 582.74 A: i see 

582.46 586.95 B: and she was just saying hey here's a way you can make ten bucks for a 

582.86 583.84 A: interesting 

586.67 587.97 A: yeah 

587.15 591.59 B: phone call i'm like hey i like to talk on the phone so [laughter] 

589.98 598.32 A: yeah i it's easy i mean it's easy money and then they said that some people there'd be three for everybody and then some people they would pick to do like twenty 

591.64 592.81 B: yeah 

598.26 599.89 B: yeah that's right it had the 

598.33 599.89 A: twenty twenty five
