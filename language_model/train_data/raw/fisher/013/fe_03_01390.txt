273.15 274.35 A: right 

273.77 276.71 B: and then the apartment had a pool and a jacuzzi 

276.53 278.04 A: wow that's pretty cool

280.57 281.71 A: yeah 

281.14 284.81 B: and i would like do a couple of laps three or four times a day 

285.07 287.55 A: that that'd would be wonderful to have available 

286.70 294.26 B: yeah it was so good for me it was really nice and then i'd go out sometimes at night and just float in the water 

293.85 295.12 A: yeah 

294.48 297.44 B: you know and um 

298.23 302.20 B: i don't thin- i think they had some fitness equipment or something i'm not sure

307.51 308.45 A: sure 

308.74 312.99 B: but i wouldn't have this if it hadn't been given to me but it's a 

313.22 318.71 B: a godsend in many ways just you know being able to stretch where i can't really exercise 

318.09 319.06 A: sure 

319.09 321.30 B: and they have a public pool 

321.75 323.97 B: and the pool is um

334.35 335.69 B: it's like 

336.44 338.38 B: takes the fun out and then 

338.95 347.78 B: everybody goes and they get hot and so they open the doors and i can't stand the cool i have to be warm and since i can't stay under the water 

343.81 344.89 A: sure 

347.83 349.67 A: right 

348.10 351.12 B: my shoulders and stuff and i just quit going 

351.14 354.10 A: oh that's too bad it's sort of a waste of a resource 

351.72 353.26 B: (( i've often thought about it )) 

353.98 354.62 B: (( mm )) 

354.48 357.92 A: it's sort of a waste of a resource it's sort of a sad story 

357.87 362.90 B: yeah it a lot of people utilize it people with heart problems and stuff 

358.74 360.73 A: it could be a comfort to you 

362.40 363.45 A: yes 

363.37 369.53 B: and um mobility more mobility than i do but i just can't i have to be warm 

367.06 368.06 A: sure

372.32 373.31 B: mhm 

372.48 374.93 A: if it were just a little different 

374.15 375.59 B: yeah

378.13 382.16 B: bought a fixer upper home or we we're we have a lease option 

382.59 384.92 B: and i would put in a um 

385.38 387.20 B: if it was large enough 

387.76 390.99 B: i would knock the kitchen out and move it around a little bit 

391.75 395.82 B: and where our closet is i'd put the bathroom and put a 

395.91 402.25 B: uh one of those hot tub bathrooms a roman bath with the spas and stuff in it yeah 

398.52 400.44 A: yeah like a jacuzzi 

401.33 402.55 A: yeah

412.45 413.45 B: no 

415.07 418.32 B: no i think that's probably what they used to be huh 

417.65 423.44 A: yeah so you probably could do that if you had to put your mind to it 

421.70 425.85 B: no uh this place isn't big enough it's only nine hundred square feet 

425.12 426.83 A: can't quite squeeze it 

426.68 427.67 B: no 

428.13 435.29 B: there's room in the back yard but it'd take half the backyard and i like my yard finally have a nice little lawn back there
