1.04 2.99 A: hi my name is andy 

2.64 5.46 B: hi uh my name's moxy how are you 

5.28 7.71 A: i'm doing well thank you i hope you are 

7.29 9.16 B: oh real good thank you 

9.04 17.20 A: yeah i couldn't quite hear what the i know it's about censorship did you have and and public and private schools but i didn't hear the whole thing 

15.42 16.53 B: yes i 

16.85 22.61 B: uh if you uh were for or against or had any ideas about it from what i understand 

22.18 23.44 A: oh okay 

22.99 24.42 B: okay um 

23.69 27.09 A: about certain books in in schools 

25.50 27.76 B: being banned right 

28.26 37.98 A: no i'm i'm not for censorship at all uh i do agree that i mean it's just my position i agree there are books that i'd rather not have 

28.26 29.05 B: it i- 

31.04 32.12 B: mhm 

38.03 40.71 A: you know my children read 

39.45 41.19 B: personally uh huh 

41.11 45.28 A: but i i ha- i feel like i need to defend their right 

45.39 48.35 A: to read them at a certain point in their life 

48.18 54.83 B: right well i guess for a start and as long as they're in my opinion as long as it would be age appropriate too because 

54.70 66.29 B: for younger kids of course you know you wouldn't want certain kids children that are too young to be reading books that are for older children too that you know won't be really what they need to read at an early age 

66.00 75.75 A: yes i i agree with you that's a very good point that it be age appropriate but um i i certainly don't like 

66.52 67.42 B: that would be 

76.37 77.52 A: you know there are 

77.60 79.15 A: so many people that 

79.43 82.60 A: do things in the name of freedom of speech 

82.21 83.21 B: mhm 

82.57 89.60 A: and uh that i don't agree with the things that they're doing but i do agree that this country gives them the right 

89.51 100.27 A: to do what they do but as far as in public schools and private schools i think private schools probably have a little more to say over what kind of books come in 

98.29 99.11 B: i w- 

99.06 108.25 B: right i i would think it i think that they do that that's one advantage i guess about um private schools they could be able to be a little bit more selective 

108.20 118.76 B: um public schools you know my daughter goes to public school and i mean so far i have had no problem with anything that they have been reading and i think it's all been been real good 

118.65 128.09 B: i guess some you know i i think the schools themselves censor what what goes in there um i mean the board must approve of certain things i guess that they'd be reading 

128.55 133.87 A: well i thi- i do think they have um quite a a say in it but i also think they 

133.96 136.07 A: give the teachers you know 

137.33 144.54 A: some credit for selecting the right book and um i know there's been controversy in the past even 

140.09 141.18 B: right 

144.48 155.09 A: with books that have been allowed to be read by parents that were totally against it so it could be a family by family issue more than just a whole censorship type thing 

154.72 155.76 B: correct 

155.07 165.66 A: and um uh my children went to private school just for the first couple of years to i just felt like they needed more one on one type 

161.52 162.46 B: mhm 

165.88 175.73 A: teaching and then from there they have been in public school all this time and i've been i've been very satisfied uh i've been sort of 

166.53 167.66 B: mhm 

171.06 171.89 B: mhm 

175.75 180.85 A: disappointed that budget cuts in schools is taking out a lotta the arts 

181.07 184.49 A: and um things like that they're proposing that it will 

184.50 186.16 A: but i i 

185.11 186.11 B: right 

186.23 200.02 A: i think they'll always have books in schools and certainly in libraries um but as far as as far as censorship per se i i'm not a a big proponent of censoring anybody 

191.89 192.81 B: well 

199.53 200.54 B: mhm 

200.20 204.29 A: even though i may not agree with what they say or what they write 

203.38 215.85 B: right i'm the same way i pretty much think that you know things are well the way they are right now as far as the public schools go um you know i have no problem at all i think it varies from area to area it seems state to state 

215.71 219.64 B: uh how you know how much censorship that they receive we're 

215.72 216.69 A: yeah 

219.43 228.11 B: in pennsylvania and uh there isn't really an incredible amount more than you know just age appropriate material from what i understand somebody 

227.88 237.65 B: may oppose of something and you know ha- is entitled to voice their opinion about certain things and i believe the school board probably reviews those uh people's requests but 

237.55 250.76 B: um as a rule i'm pretty much open like you said w- with public libraries they're a they're a fantastic uh asset that we have in our community and i i think it's the you know the same with the schools too um they should not receive any 

248.67 249.84 A: (( [sigh] [mn] )) 

250.87 251.75 B: uh 

250.99 254.61 A: i live in i live in the south the bible belt 

254.64 269.30 A: but i i really think that uh the people in the south i'm not originally from the south but i've lived down here now for over thirty years and and i think sometimes that people in the south get a really bad rap for being um very 

269.60 284.27 A: austere in in how they think of of censorship and things and i tend to find that most parents are parents everywhere you know you're gonna have a certain group that just you know uh they just have to 

270.55 271.53 B: (( uh huh )) 

278.17 279.28 B: right 

284.05 292.16 B: i know i- i it does seem to be no yeah you can't please all the people all the time and that's definitely true right no matter where 

284.57 288.68 A: have something going on [laughter] 

289.41 292.69 A: exactly but but for the most part 

292.81 303.11 A: you know other parents are just like i am you know they they feel that yeah there's some things that they don't like but as far as in the schools down here um 

304.99 308.83 A: we haven't had any problems about censorship in the public schools 

307.24 310.42 B: mm no nothing here really locally i i 

310.25 320.38 B: i recall some time ago on the news um something a parent was complaining about a book or something that a magazine that was in the school that was pertaining to witchcraft 

320.18 330.30 B: and i don't really know what became of that you know if they took it out or what may have happened but i i think in my mind that they had taken it out it was just some- 

330.10 343.49 B: something that was right in the school like that they could go to the uh library and look at it but i think it had been removed but it wasn't here locally very locally it may have been in pennsylvania i don't quite recall 

332.93 333.86 A: yeah 

343.73 345.01 B: but um 

344.17 344.97 A: (( well )) 

345.33 355.40 B: a a complete censorship definitely would not you know that would not be good our our country is founded in you know the rights that we do have and it ma- that's what makes it great 

355.10 358.85 A: yeah [sigh] well i feel the same way i think uh you know 

355.45 357.05 B: it's for all the people 

359.72 368.38 A: there are some things in our country that can be improved upon but there is no place else i'd rather live on earth than america i think we 

365.76 368.35 B: oh definitely right 

368.43 379.18 A: i think you know a lot of times that people are who are griping about living here if they would live in some of these third world countries i think they would appreciate what they have a whole lot more 

375.51 376.90 B: i know 

377.49 389.93 B: exactly w- we are just so blessed here and i mean censorship is one of the the things that you know the openness that we have and the ability to make our own choices is what really makes our country great 

389.84 392.61 A: exactly yeah uh 

392.66 402.88 A: i don't know how long we're supposed to talk about this issue i think it was something like eight or ten minutes am i right i haven't ever been on one of these before have you done one of these 

397.81 401.33 B: ten minutes i think right yes so it should be pretty soon 

401.39 404.70 B: this is the second this is the second one i've done 

404.39 405.42 A: (( uh huh )) 

404.86 412.94 B: it's very interesting the other one uh huh it is i mean censorship i mean i i had heard last night that they were going to be talking about it and i was 

406.54 408.44 A: it really it is 

412.84 423.65 B: contemplating whether i wanted to get involved with it but you know it seems like a really good subject because there there's all different kinds of aspects that you could look at you know religious wise uh 

423.52 432.15 B: you know the age i guess the age appropriate schools normally do investigate and make sure that the material that their children do receive is age appropriate 

431.93 444.01 B: and a lot of people i have heard complain about sex education in schools but you know as long as it's age appropriate i don't have a problem with my daughter learning anything you know in um school as she gets older 

443.91 457.69 A: exactly uh i've always just told mine that you know you're gonna you are gonna be you know when it came time for her to be talking and learning about that i said but i still w- you know you and i will be talking and 

452.60 454.98 B: right we're gonna be talking [mn] 

456.56 465.39 B: right it's our responsibility to you know teach these things to our children too and you know we have influence uh on uh what they think and 

463.21 476.59 A: exactly and i you know you want to know what they're being taught so that you can you know if it's not the way that your family views certain issues that you can put uh input into that as well as what they're getting from school 

476.33 477.93 B: (( right [mn] )) 

476.83 486.38 A: uh not just because uh they're being taught sex education that means okay now i can go out and find out w- all about everything you know 

484.43 498.38 B: mhm that's the problem you know lack of communication in par- with parents and children you know i think that we a- you know as parents need to take a lot of responsibility as far as teaching our children things too 

498.26 510.67 B: and um you know i don't have any problem as far as my daughter getting access to information from school because the school that um she g- attends is a is a really good school and um you know i i 

510.67 517.87 B: have yet to see any- anybody complain in the local area about any problems or any literature that they didn't want in there 

517.61 525.69 A: yeah this school here is uh rated like the best in like three different southern states so yeah 

523.71 526.66 B: is that right what uh state is it 

526.03 527.71 A: it's south carolina 

527.07 530.71 B: oh how nice you're so lucky [laughter] yeah i'm 

528.19 529.07 A: yeah 

529.26 543.18 A: yeah so we're we're very fortunate to have a really good school and some very wonderful teachers that uh go above and beyond and um and engl- you know english literature that that she's reading 

533.38 534.22 B: mhm 

543.24 548.61 A: and talking to me about i mean i have not been against any of it 

548.81 557.06 A: it's all age appropriate and things that um i think will enrich her now there is times she's like oh i don't feel like reading this 

556.48 557.43 B: (( uh huh )) 

556.94 565.67 A: but i say well you know there'll come a time that you look back on it and say yeah i read that in school and she said but they don't it's the good with the bad 

562.36 564.81 B: right i know at some time in your life 

565.09 573.77 B: right and then you know at some point in your life if you can't use it now you you know it'll come up like you said later on and you'll you know be glad that you did learn and uh read it 

573.57 575.02 A: exactly 

573.74 583.97 B: um i think that you know it's a good thing as i said for the kids to get a general idea what's out in the world you know because when they get out of school they're gonna be making their own choices too and 

579.78 580.73 A: (( it's that's )) 

583.77 594.60 B: you know like we were saying if they if we have a rapport with our kids and talk about uh things with them while they're still young you know when they get out there it won't be so difficult for them too 

594.01 594.65 A: (( right )) 

594.78 599.89 A: that's why i really do not agree with censorship because even you gotta
