10.83 15.80 A: okay um personally i think smoking should be banned from public places because 

16.26 20.93 A: um i'm one that is highly allergic to smoke and whenever i'm around it i get very very ill 

21.34 21.85 B: hm 

30.62 32.72 A: you don't have the right to infringe upon my rights 

32.84 33.11 A: so 

32.98 33.38 B: mhm 

33.95 35.23 A: that is the way i feel about 

35.51 36.68 A: smoking in public places 

36.83 37.19 B: hm 

36.88 37.73 A: personally 

37.56 39.68 B: we were uh 

39.84 43.11 B: an exact total match because i feel exactly the same way 

43.88 52.41 B: um i was i live in california and i was so glad when they took cigarettes away awhile ago so moving back to the east coast and discovering 

52.81 55.82 B: they still smoke in public places it was awful but i 

56.15 58.91 B: kind of dealt with it but i'm in total agreement 

59.14 60.24 B: and i smell smoke 

60.76 70.95 B: um the hairs in my nose just kind of stand up to attention and my nose starts dripping so i haven't been officially declared allergic to it but i believe i have an allergy 

71.61 75.25 B: cigarettes and i totally agree that they should be banned from public places 

75.68 78.78 B: or anywhere where it interferes with um others who 

79.04 80.98 B: don't necessarily want to be exposed to 

81.58 85.75 B: cigarettes and stuff so i don't believe they have public places (( )) because children are there 

83.08 83.74 A: hm 

86.27 87.73 B: and children shouldn't have to be 

88.08 89.92 B: around that especially when 

90.60 91.26 B: you know they are not 

91.60 93.59 B: uh they are not choosing whether or not they want 

94.05 96.16 B: want to be there in the smoke environment 

96.63 99.52 B: but i don't think they should be exposed to it if they don't have to 

96.77 97.57 A: exactly 

109.88 114.79 A: you know i later on down the road get sick because of second hand smoke exposure that's 

114.89 116.35 A: people don't have the right to 

116.70 122.97 A: inflict things upon me and it may be a short-term er you know it may be a long-term sort of thing but every little bit hurts and 

122.62 123.02 B: mhm 

134.02 134.51 A: i mean 

134.80 136.46 A: that is enough for even right there 

136.48 138.25 B: right right right 

137.90 140.07 A: so but you are right about kids i mean 

140.17 144.72 A: you know it it's it's dangerous to their health and the fact that other people can hurt 

145.27 148.96 A: someone especially children to me i don't even understand why it is a question 

149.02 149.48 B: right 

149.88 155.49 B: i think i mean they got the label right there on the cigarettes the surgeon general says it is not good for your health and so they it was like 

155.68 158.83 B: they all know it but yet they still want it (( )) 

158.36 158.91 A: mhm 

159.27 161.44 B: and then i don't like the idea even in um 

161.85 165.43 B: like when you go to an office building and they don't you can't smoke in the building 

165.54 165.92 A: mhm 

165.77 171.65 B: everybody else is still outside smoking right in front and you still have to walk through all these people smoking 

171.92 173.96 B: you know they should make it if they are going to do it 

174.56 175.64 B: make the public place 

175.87 176.72 B: away from 

177.66 185.36 A: oh exactly i mean you know we have pretty bad winters around here and people go outside and smoke and they prop open the doors because they don't want to get cold 

178.42 179.02 B: (( )) 

181.61 182.53 B: mhm 

186.60 188.95 A: and that seems silly to me i mean 

193.99 194.36 A: hello 

194.45 195.10 B: oh sorry 

195.09 203.85 A: oh i didn't know if you are still there yeah um yeah people prop open the doors it's around here we have a saying smoking doesn't lead to cancer it leads to frostbite because 

196.53 196.91 B: yeah 

203.68 204.12 B: ach 

204.05 211.36 A: you know you have to go outside to do it but they don't get cold and then it all wafts in the building and what is really the point of that 

210.54 212.13 B: right right right right 

212.54 213.73 B: i i'm i'm 

214.07 215.27 B: i'm so glad somebody 

215.43 218.57 B: i talked to somebody that is in total agreement with me because i don't know 

218.67 225.35 B: i would've dealt with it but i really appreciate how you feel about cigarettes and i feel about cigarettes because it it's i mean 

225.77 228.94 B: it i'm (( )) that we are both in total agreement about it but 

228.02 228.62 A: mhm 

229.07 236.71 B: like i say this awful if you are pregnant and you have to be exposed to it you you you are in a public place and people are smoking in there 

237.08 238.74 B: infringing upon your space 

238.94 239.66 A: mhm 

239.05 247.06 B: and besides that they are smoking and they have a filter they have they are getting less smoke than we are as non-smokers because we are getting the smoke 

244.70 245.35 A: right 

249.38 250.01 A: right 

253.64 254.19 B: if you want to 

254.31 260.96 B: kill yourself because you want to smoke and you want to be exposed and suck up all the cigarettes then you should do it on your own terms and not on somebody else's 

263.02 263.73 B: right 

263.84 264.30 B: mhm 

270.83 271.52 B: right 

272.14 272.62 B: right 

272.79 273.26 B: right 

272.84 275.46 A: and in the same respect when i go to their house i know 

275.72 280.99 A: that's that's the risk that i take when i go over there i'm exposing myself but that is my choice 

278.36 279.03 B: right 

280.71 281.56 B: right exactly 

281.62 289.25 A: in a public place i don't get that choice if i have to go to a school or a store or an office building i don't have the choice not to be there 

289.50 290.80 B: right that is true 

290.05 298.45 A: so it's it's seems strange to me that they are infringing upon our personal rights and we have we can't do anything about it i don't even understand why 

295.11 295.58 B: mhm 

297.00 297.61 B: right 

298.98 302.31 A: i don't understand why it is a question if it impacts someone else then 

302.50 306.18 A: you know obviously you don't have the right to impact someone else's life in their house 

310.26 310.86 A: mhm 

313.17 313.62 A: mhm 

313.41 316.81 B: if someone to smoke and they have their windows down my thing is 

316.94 318.91 B: if you want to smoke you you should 

319.15 325.51 B: suck up all that smoke yourself roll the windows up and you sit there and smell all that smoke and not let others have to 

325.78 328.44 B: um be exposed to what it is that you want to do 

328.69 329.38 A: oh yeah 

338.51 339.67 A: mhm 

338.77 344.05 B: my (( )) i have to say i'm having to be exposed to your cigarette smoke 

340.33 340.75 A: mhm 

344.35 346.81 B: you know you are infringing upon my private space 

347.51 351.73 B: it you know and the air that i have to breathe was your cigarettes because it is something that you want to do 

351.68 358.82 A: well wait i have a sun-roof in my car and i have had on more than one occasion people actually throw cigarettes out their window and have them land in my car 

356.52 356.85 B: i 

357.15 357.63 B: oh my 

358.36 359.08 B: goodness 

359.12 363.79 A: and at one time i actually threw it back in the other person's car and they had the nerve to yell at me 

362.16 362.54 B: uh-huh 

363.93 367.23 B: oh no they didn't they threw that cigar they threw it in yours first 

365.86 369.27 A: yeah they threw it and they said well if you don't like it you should shut your window 

369.89 376.34 A: and i it it's that whole attitude that a lot of smokers have that i can do whatever i want and if you don't like it you can leave 

370.01 371.35 B: no they (( )) 

376.10 378.68 B: oh my goodness i can not believe that 

388.47 390.64 B: you flicked it up 

388.49 392.67 A: you know and starting to roll up his window so i rolled mine down and threw it into his vehicle 

392.76 394.95 B: oh my goodness that's 

394.35 401.70 A: you know and at that point an apology or even just you know kind of ignoring it but no he had the nerve to yell at me and tell me i didn't have the right to do that 

401.85 409.34 B: and he threw it at your car and here and you know infringing upon your your your space and your clean air with his cigarette oh my god 

403.74 404.18 A: mhm 

407.63 408.26 A: mhm 

408.61 409.89 A: oh right and his his 

409.98 411.50 A: he yelled and said you know if 

411.87 416.56 A: if you don't like it shut your window and what i did was an accident and what you did was intentional that is not right 

417.87 423.05 A: and i i disagreed that you unintentionally kill me or unintentionally hurt my house that doesn't 

423.41 424.78 A: change the fact that you did it 

424.23 424.79 B: right 

424.97 427.38 B: that you did what you did 

426.05 435.01 A: mhm and if these people didn't know but i mean like you said it is on the package of cigarettes everybody knows that it is harmful everybody knows second-hand smoke is bad 

434.57 435.12 B: right 

435.13 439.67 A: but they continue to make that choice for themselves which is fine but they don't have the right to make it for me 

439.70 440.18 B: right 

440.58 441.78 B: at what wait a minute 

443.65 444.17 B: is that a beep 

444.46 444.91 B: for us 

445.17 447.33 A: i don't know all i heard was a click 

447.00 448.03 B: what wait a minute 

460.42 460.82 B: hello 

460.92 461.71 A: yes 

461.35 466.36 B: oh okay i i wasn't sure it was like i hear um it was the other line that was beeping um 

465.34 466.94 A: oh call waiting 

466.63 469.80 B: yeah i i wasn't sure how the call (( )) 

470.35 472.69 A: no i don't know i have never done this before 

472.21 474.63 B: oh me nether oh okay so i guess we just 

474.76 476.39 B: continue talking how long have we talked 

476.53 480.15 A: um i think about nine minutes eight minutes or something like that 

482.02 482.47 A: yeah 

483.83 493.90 B: um like here i live in in georgia and they just passed a law about smoking in public and people are complaining and bars are complaining that they are going to lose business 

494.09 500.33 B: because you can't smoke in certain areas and i totally disagree because i think more people 

495.41 495.81 A: mhm 

500.49 507.81 B: to me as time has gone on and more people have quite smoking -cause i knew a whole lot more smokers when i was younger and people have quit smoking 

505.69 506.12 A: mhm 

508.09 511.60 B: and so more people are becoming relaxed about 

511.72 512.27 B: um 

512.78 513.34 B: um 

513.88 523.46 B: i mean they are enjoying the fact that they can go to a public place and smoke it is not all in the place and or it is like at the airport you don't have you know you can't just freely smoke and i think it's it's 

521.15 521.47 A: mhm
