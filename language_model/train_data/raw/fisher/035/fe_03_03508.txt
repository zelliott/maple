0.60 1.72 B: hello 

1.39 4.18 A: hey good afternoon it's glenn in boston 

3.95 6.42 B: hi this is boon in new york 

5.89 8.29 A: boon i used to be a new yorker 

7.83 9.78 B: you used to be in new york huh 

9.43 12.91 A: as a matter of fact i probably work for minimum wage how 'bout you 

12.32 22.85 B: [laughter] well i'm working for less than the minimum wage i'm a student uh and i'm getting a stipend from my university so it's uh it's probably less than minimum wage considering how much i work 

16.07 16.92 A: (( uh-huh )) 

22.61 24.16 A: it's legal 

23.94 31.25 B: yeah [laughter] it's legal indeed well i i suppose i should be glad that i'm one of the ones getting money instead of the ones uh dishing it out so 

31.90 32.83 B: but uh 

32.97 38.35 A: so minimum wage there's certainly plenty of work at that uh salary now 

33.24 34.04 B: yes 

38.38 40.99 B: well yeah indeed indeed 

40.19 41.68 A: what year are you in 

41.63 44.19 B: i am a first year graduate student 

43.76 47.61 A: ah wow so you're hoping to do better than minimum wage 

47.24 52.71 B: hopefully yes i'm i'm in a phd program so i will uh be a professor i imagine 

53.15 55.48 A: interesting interesting choice 

54.09 54.86 B: yes 

55.68 58.27 A: it's uh certainly going to be competitive 

58.12 69.69 B: indeed the market is uh it's tough they pump out five five phds every year for every one job opening so i'm hoping that the baby boomers will be retiring in a few years when i have my degree and i'm looking for a job 

71.14 72.70 A: so uh 

71.53 72.98 B: yes what do you do 

73.00 85.32 A: i used to be uh i used to work on wall street and i used to make a good chunk of change and now i probably i still right now i wouldn't say i've applied to too many minimum wage positions but 

84.64 85.90 B: mhm 

85.96 93.19 A: but there's certainly not a lot out there um i've been i've been rejected from minimum wage positions how do ya like that 

88.37 89.41 B: yep 

92.61 95.51 B: [laughter] that is that is too bad 

93.39 97.14 A: i've i've got ten i don't have a p. h. d. i have a college degree 

96.69 97.49 B: (( ah )) 

97.18 101.04 A: and uh you know fifteen years of computer experience 

101.19 107.22 A: so what i do now is i do uh consulting website design graphic design [lipsmack] 

104.04 104.86 B: mhm 

107.56 110.89 A: and uh that's after two years of job searching 

110.65 111.47 B: yep 

110.90 117.15 A: and uh yeah minimum wage i'm probably doing marginally better than minimum wage 

115.79 116.42 B: [mn] 

116.56 117.48 B: yes 

117.46 127.17 A: there's there's pros and cons there you know i mean if i were going to take a job for minimum wage if they were gonna pay four thousand dollars a year for my health insurance 

126.78 127.76 B: of course 

127.71 129.56 A: it's not such a bad deal 

129.53 130.56 B: right 

130.28 134.53 A: [lipsmack] although i'll tell you even star bucks pays better than minimum wage 

134.16 148.55 B: here in the city i don't think there are that many jobs for minimum wage probably in boston as well because i mean the the cost of living is so high especially rent and things like that it's so outrageous that for five fifteen an hour i don't you couldn't you literally couldn't afford to uh 

148.48 150.22 B: to pay your rent 

148.82 149.74 A: commute 

150.01 153.37 A: and now the now the subway fare's two dollars [laughter] 

150.47 152.12 B: all that rent 

152.69 155.06 B: right right so uh 

155.42 168.58 B: so yeah i think that i don't i don't know if it's sufficient i i mean i think that there are for me personally obviously when i go and get a job and i look for minimum and i look for a job if it's if i'm looking for some wacky job at at star bucks then i wanna make as much as possible 

168.51 183.00 B: no i think looking at it i'm a i'm a philosopher so when i look at it on a higher level i try to look at it as the state's responsibility i i mean i think that there's it's uh questionable i mean i'm not really sure what position i take you can take either you can take the the uh 

182.63 183.86 A: the high road 

183.00 195.27 B: the the welfare state kind of approach in which case everybody should have access to health care everybody should be making money you know as you move further left on the on the political scale everybody should have uh have access to 

195.08 208.52 B: to health care and education and uh public services and as well companies should be forced to pay their workers a fair living wage on the other hand if you're if you're kind of a cold blooded capitalist as they say or if you're if you 

207.39 208.68 A: [laughter] 

208.45 212.18 B: if you swing more right than left then your then your balance say 

212.28 225.82 B: [lipsmack] then maybe you should just let the market determine what minimum wage is and what's gonna happen eventually i mean i kind of lean this way i feel a little bad because i think that uh i i mean a lot of the world and especially a lot of ed- a lot of educated people are very liberal in their politics 

225.43 226.41 A: uh-huh 

225.64 238.54 B: but i personally feel that um if you o- over the course of a few decades if you if you take away the minimum wage or or don't raise it any more what's gonna happen is that it's gonna force education 

238.69 252.63 B: in order for people to get jobs i don't think i think i mean i think a lotta people look at it there's gonna be stratification but i but i personally think that people are going say well i better buck up and i better go out there and work as hard as i can to get the job that i can i don't know i mean it's a tough situation because you've got 

252.61 264.16 B: so many people who are disadvantaged and so it it creates a cycle where they they can't get a j- or they they can't get educated so they can't get a good job and so they're they're not worth as much to the free market right so they can't 

262.67 270.65 A: well you know if you don't have a green card you're not really getting minimum wage anyway you're not educated but the truth is 

267.14 268.97 B: right right 

270.86 274.18 A: unfortunately the reality of the situation is 

274.76 288.30 A: i'd have to say that it's it's wrong for the government to interfere in in the free market it may be well intentioned but usually the end result of the government policy is misplaced and now what you see happening is 

274.94 275.50 B: (( [noise] )) 

279.76 280.60 B: yes 

285.58 286.75 B: (( mhm yes )) 

288.32 295.82 A: hordes of worker being shipped off to india and ireland and mexico where that's not an issue 

295.76 305.40 B: it's true and i think there's a middle there's a middle ground we can't be extremist about it you can't say the government should butt out completely and we should be completely less affair about our economy because 

305.27 315.27 B: that's because we're just this is not ideal this is not a utopia we have to deal with problems that are left over from the last few hundred years of of the way things have worked uh of you know 

315.11 317.88 B: of blacks being in slavery and uh 

317.75 331.01 B: and of different people coming into and and well labor of use and things like that so we do indeed have to deal with these things and the sexes you know inequality between wages between the sexes i mean these things do have to be accounted for i think and so we can't just let less affair uh 

330.87 342.55 B: politics and less affair ec- economics take hold of the country i think we do need to the government does need to put their hand in there and make sure the workers and the peons the lower class gets get their fair share 

342.43 353.93 B: but on the other hand i think that yes like in in an ideal state and hopefully we're moving towards an ideal state the government will move more and more out of the private sector and just say and just let them do whatever they want 

353.33 356.79 A: certainly the government doesn't have too many minimum wage jobs 

356.40 358.62 B: [laughter] yeah 

357.19 360.64 A: you know what's you know what's i thought with minimum wage 

360.85 367.82 A: minimum wage is based on a national standard of living which doesn't really exist in either new york or boston 

364.34 365.14 B: right 

367.44 368.75 B: mhm 

368.34 380.66 A: um it's fine to say you live in kansas i think five fifteen an hour would suffice if you're gonna live out in the midwest where the price of the cost of living is clearly a fraction of what it would be in the northeast 

375.37 375.93 B: (( [noise] )) 

380.06 383.65 B: and really a fraction like i grew up in midwest and so i uh 

383.58 390.59 B: i know that what i that i could for what i'm paying for rent here i could live in my i could be paying a mortgage on your parents' 

386.83 387.87 A: (( oh gosh )) 

390.56 401.42 B: thirty five hundred square foot you know half a million dollar home that's the kind of differences there and i have a one bedroom in a in a four bedroom apartment so it's really outrageous and i think that you're right it is a national thing that 

401.35 415.43 B: but so what's the answer i mean to be it can't be state regulated because even here in the state of new york you know someone living upstate is gonna have a lot of different there is going to be a drastically different cost of living than here in the city so what do you think should it be should it be locally legislated 

412.29 413.95 A: that's an interesting point 

416.50 419.01 A: that's an interesting point um 

419.06 430.47 A: there would probably be a horde of conflicts of interest if they were to move the legislation down the chain of command from federal to state or local control 

428.66 429.74 B: mhm 

429.75 442.25 B: well i think another problem would be that if all of a sudden the minimum wage were really high in in the highly populated areas you'd see a disbursement of population because you'd see jobs moving outside there companies 

442.07 446.18 B: like just like they're moving to india and mexico now they would move to 

446.07 457.11 B: a more sparsely uh more sparsely populated areas that the minimum wage would be lower right and then they would and so you'd see a lotta people moving out there i think you'd see movement away from the cities into rural areas mhm [mn] 

456.42 465.73 A: it seems to me that the minimum wage i thought it was five fifty not five fifteen but it seems to me that that number is arbitrarily low based on you know 

465.92 470.01 A: government numbers that say you can live on bread water and butter 

469.83 470.88 B: (( yeah )) 

470.30 473.18 A: it's it's a reduced basket i mean 

473.60 483.65 A: you may be able to uh pay rent and and subsist and continue existing continue getting to work but uh you're gonna live in very 

483.10 485.05 B: (( [noise] )) 

483.79 490.80 A: poverty i mean that's basically at the poverty line isn't it if you make five fifteen an hour you're below the national poverty level 

487.84 488.85 B: (( yeah )) 

490.84 492.05 A: so it seems 

490.89 500.68 B: yeah well what's let's do the figuring here five hundred five fifteen let's say five dollars an hour times uh times forty dollars a forty dollars a week yeah ten thousand a year so that's uh 

496.69 498.59 A: that's about ten thousand a year 

500.78 502.27 B: right 

501.37 506.38 A: that's pretty low it seems to me then maybe the minimum wage should be closer to seven bucks 

506.61 508.19 B: yeah 

507.21 513.81 A: i mean that would certainly cover somewhere b- it should be h- i think it should be higher than five fifteen whether it 

513.10 521.35 B: yeah yeah i think you make a good point because if the government is going to go out and the government actually sets a poverty line right it's the government job they actually 

521.18 535.90 B: they make the moral decision that they're gonna set a poverty line and allow people under that line to apply for welfare and things like that and if they're gonna make a minimum wage they should if they've g- if they've already made the commitment to make a poverty line then they should make also make a commitment to make the minimum wage 

526.47 527.42 A: right 

535.56 536.75 A: above that 

535.91 540.29 B: (( above poverty level right i think you're absolutely right there being a good system yep )) 

538.52 545.82 A: it's ridiculous that means we're basically saying you can work for this amount but we're gonna have to pay you a stipend to to s- to exist 

545.45 546.56 B: exactly 

545.97 548.63 A: god forbid you have a family and kids 

548.30 549.36 B: right 

550.03 553.11 A: so where does that leave us with the minimum wage 

552.72 553.66 B: um 

554.02 555.67 B: i guess i guess 

555.46 564.17 B: my thoughts are that in a in an idealized world you know that the minimum wage wouldn't need to be in place that everyone would find their niche 

563.83 565.59 A: (( less affair )) 

563.96 572.11 B: and right less affair you know everyone would find where they belong you know and everyone would get what they're worth [laughter] things like that uh 

571.95 586.93 B: and you know what that would amount to is that c._e._o.s you know wouldn't get all the money that they get now they would get less because anyone could do that [laughter] or a lotta people can do that i would i think that in a true less affair it would be more that everyone would be closer to the middle than they are right now 

586.83 588.61 B: um so i 

587.57 592.39 A: there's certainly a a fair amount of disparity in the pay scales right now 

591.94 599.89 B: indeed and and it's certainly not based on the worth of a human being because i think that a c. e. o. making fifteen million dollars a year
