36.33 42.41 A: well we have lots of tornadoes here too but thankfully this year we've been pretty quiet 

42.24 44.51 B: oh well that's great 

43.46 50.30 A: oh yeah they scare me to death [laughter] the one thing on the planet i'm afraid of 

46.10 48.43 B: oh [laughter] well 

49.79 56.04 B: [laughter] we just kind of pray 'em past us it's like lord just send 'em right over us please and 

55.43 57.20 A: oh please yes 

56.06 66.12 B: so far i've been spared but it's it's it's one of those things we just kind of accept so well how do you feel about um [mn] 

66.28 69.18 B: raising the minimum wage to that do you 

67.85 69.05 A: i think 

69.15 71.41 A: they i don't think it's enough 

71.19 72.10 B: uh-huh 

71.79 74.39 A: i really don't i know so many 

74.61 78.24 A: people that live paycheck to paycheck me being one 

78.42 80.33 A: but it it's 

78.46 79.97 B: right 

80.72 87.22 A: uh [mn] it's v- very difficult to work minimum wage forty hour a week and support a family 

87.06 89.00 B: yeah definitely 

87.68 101.70 A: and it it just with more and more companies asking for part time work e- elimination of benefits especially medical how do you work minimum wage and take your kid to a doctor when they're sick 

101.58 102.78 B: (( yeah )) 

101.99 110.11 A: i mean fortunately for me i don't have that problem i remember a time years ago when young starting out and we did 

103.61 108.62 B: (( yeah )) 

109.85 113.37 B: yeah yeah 

110.22 113.93 A: so i just don't i don't i- think that's enough 

114.20 115.87 A: there there's too much of a 

114.35 125.73 B: well personally i don't see how you can afford at all you know i mean to me minimum wage should be for teenagers or or 

125.80 131.73 B: you know if someone's greatly mentally impaired you know but still able to work some 

131.78 133.90 B: i- that's a good you know 

133.63 134.67 A: right 

134.31 145.45 B: a good thing but to to try and live on it as an adult is for a family it just seems beyond comprehension to me you know absurd 

144.50 145.32 A: well 

145.50 150.46 A: i agree but i look at it like when you have c._e._o.s of companies 

145.86 156.32 B: (( mhm )) 

150.72 163.38 A: and their salaries are six million dollars their benefits and perks raise it to twenty million a year and yet the low guy on the totem pole you're complaining about you know having to give him a minimum raise 

163.24 167.81 B: (( right )) 

163.65 171.49 A: minimum wage raise you know what you [mn] you know what after the first couple of million how much do you really need a year 

171.48 174.95 B: well [laughter] i agree i agree 

172.09 174.50 A: you know really if 

174.46 186.63 A: if people if they put it in if they thought and put it into their workers making their workers happy happy their workplace safe and productive their prod- productivity would go up their overhead 

182.41 185.05 B: (( mhm )) 

185.18 187.87 B: mhm 

186.44 191.98 A: with turnover and training and all that would decline they'd actually make more money 

190.02 191.01 B: definitely 

191.73 192.55 B: yes 

192.79 193.80 A: you know 

193.12 198.33 B: and and the world would be a better place because of it mhm 

195.18 202.60 A: yes and and that and and just looking at the moral side of the the coin too you know it's just the right thing to do 

199.40 201.90 B: mhm mhm 

202.54 204.03 B: yeah well 

202.82 206.32 A: but people just see dollar signs and go 

206.42 209.02 A: [mn] sense just goes out the door 

208.65 214.83 B: right well did they can do you know [mn] because when the topic came up i thought 

214.84 225.78 B: [mn] you know my first thought is well nobody can live on that unless they're a teenager you know living at home and they're doing that to earn extra money and and i be- 

225.79 227.99 B: began to think um 

228.46 242.86 B: and and i've always you know lived middle class or lower middle class you know never anything greater than that so it's something um that's quite a reality to me and i um 

236.88 238.21 A: right 

242.87 251.01 B: i have two adult children and and one teenager and i think about them and i think there's just [mn] 

252.21 258.54 B: in fact my oldest is moving back home this weekend um and she makes uh [mn] 

254.97 256.20 A: yeah 

258.52 269.97 B: not double minimum wage but nearly that you know and she's still because of yeah it's still difficult so i i i wonder if they've ever considered it 

263.06 264.70 A: it's so hard 

265.16 266.51 A: and 

270.14 278.98 B: being you know okay it's minimum wage for this age and then th- this age it has to be a higher rate um 

278.12 291.72 A: uh that that's something to think about and also you had a good point with the mentally and physically challenged they are subsidized by the government they get subsidized housing and that so for them to make minimum wage 

284.19 285.06 B: uh-huh 

286.63 288.70 B: right right 

288.79 290.22 B: mhm 

291.58 298.61 A: really isn't discrimination because they're they're so- th- they have a government subsidy that makes up their any difference 

298.26 309.53 B: well and i'm i'm assuming that they're not able to do more complicated tasks you know as well but i think that adults that are you know that just simply 

302.78 305.17 A: exactly exactly 

309.51 313.98 B: are doing the best they can do they they deserve to be 

314.81 320.54 B: paid a more respectable wage um 

320.76 325.09 B: i- if they have to work at y- you know at mcdonalds you still need 

325.26 329.64 B: people with maturity you know and and that should be 

327.33 328.23 A: mhm 

329.70 331.14 B: considered 

331.27 346.13 A: exact- yes i agree but it's difficult when you have companies who will move their plants from the united states close the doors and move to the philippines is real big for medical and um 

332.29 333.51 B: y- you know 

345.16 348.08 B: mhm mhm 

346.17 350.59 A: medications prescriptions and stuff because they can pay these people 

350.63 364.09 A: a hundred dollars a week or less and yet those jobs are clearly people were making a good salary they were able to be middle class and purchase the home and have a new car and a used car in the driveway i mean 

360.91 364.84 B: (( yeah mhm mhm )) 

364.18 379.05 A: i i i you know my mom says i don't understand why you guys 'cause i have no savings well it's expensive i have four kids i have one going off to college to school blah blah well it doesn't cost that much mine it costs over a hundred dollars to register each one 

369.15 370.01 B: uh-huh

381.15 384.10 A: in your day no it didn't cost anything 

384.17 391.84 A: you know when you bought your your home it was twenty five thousand dollars and people thought you were nuts for spending so much 

391.48 393.18 B: yeah 

391.90 395.19 A: now you can't touch that same house for under two fifty 

395.03 397.08 B: right 

395.76 406.50 A: and it it's you know granted it's been forty years but i myself remember going to the store and my ma paying nine cents a pound for chicken 

406.38 416.02 B: [laughter] [laughter] yes [laughter] well what about the price a gas you know fifty nine cents [laughter]

513.49 514.68 A: oh okay

531.28 538.24 B: [laughter] well someday i'm going to take one but i know i i just 

538.77 544.86 B: anyway so i think yeah i think that there needs to be some restructuring some 

544.83 548.56 B: some rethinking just on minimum wage in general 

548.17 549.06 A: mhm 

548.39 562.41 B: but but approaching the problem not just at that end but approaching it okay w- what about restricting these companies that like you said go to the philippines you know or go to mexico where the labor's cheap 

561.88 563.05 A: mhm 

562.49 563.97 B: and um 

564.17 568.53 B: [mn] what about making it more difficult for them to do that 

568.64 570.01 A: exactly 

568.77 569.63 B: you know 

569.40 577.66 B: a- and and making it more difficult for these these people in the [mn] l- you know like you were talking about that 

577.43 591.78 B: the c._e._o.s that make these ridiculous salaries and [mn] do something [laughter] do something about it you know by attacking it not just one place but several different areas 

591.25 599.89 A: well they they they need to do something because i i can't imagine a single mom which is like fifty percent of the households in the united states 

591.55 592.54 B: yeah
