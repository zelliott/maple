0.29 1.68 A: hi 

1.91 3.28 A: (( my name's elena )) 

2.71 4.83 B: hi my name is hattie 

4.48 5.90 A: nice to meet you 

5.40 6.52 B: (( same here )) 

6.00 15.00 A: [laughter] okay so the topic um you know it's it's interesting 'cause i was just thinking god i'm maybe i'm a little unfamiliar as to what the minimum wage is 

8.50 9.45 B: yeah 

13.90 20.78 B: oh yeah and she just said it was five thousand and whatever change and ah i think [laughter] it should be much more 

18.01 19.24 A: yeah 

20.64 29.76 A: yeah i you know i think it is true and when i heard that figure i thought you know it it does seem really low and being how expensive things are 

20.96 21.98 B: i mean 

28.98 30.97 B: yeah exact- where do you live 

30.45 32.00 A: i live in new york 

31.50 45.71 B: oh i live in new york too so being what the economy is ah how could anybody i mean unless it's unless it's someone that's retired and to supplement their income you know just to earn a little extra money 

32.89 33.96 A: yeah 

37.08 39.80 A: how how do they make it how do they make ends meet 

45.03 52.78 A: right right i was thinking of ah you know someone who is very very young and is just starting to work out and it might be their spending money but 

50.52 51.64 B: right right 

51.90 64.98 B: exactly but ah like when i was a student in high school i had an after school job i made a dollar twenty five an hour [laughter] so but but ah for a person that has to support a family there's no way they can live on that and 

58.06 59.42 A: right right 

63.68 74.62 A: oh there's no way and unfortunately i mean it's there are so many people even in new york even under the radar of minimum wage 

66.71 67.53 B: it's 

74.28 76.51 B: i know i know and 

75.04 83.99 A: that it makes it um it it makes it pretty challenging and i'm i'm not even too sure if it's possible in fact you know come to think of it i i keep thinking 

84.17 88.60 A: maybe it's not i i i'm sure that they're not making ends meet 

88.38 95.08 B: they're no actually they're not and that's where a lot of people go into illegal ah activities because of that [laughter] 

93.51 100.37 A: oh absolutely absolutely because aside from even new york city which of course is expensive um 

95.56 96.58 B: (( and ah )) 

100.61 115.34 A: but i mean i think its surroundings boroughs are pretty expensive as well and even if you do need to my god with all the prices going up yes [laughter] that's an absolutely yes i mean subway now is two dollars 

109.07 111.77 B: oh it's it's it's terrible it's it's 

115.17 116.31 B: yeah 

115.68 128.67 A: and ah you know with all of that going up it would absolutely be deserving for it to go up because i would say that most people even commute on the trains and that's a fifty cent hike already 

128.73 137.85 B: well ah you know i i don't know maybe ah what the answer is ah why they're even asking this question because i don't know do they take a v- they don't vote on it do they 

137.61 141.11 A: you know i i'm i'm really curious [laughter] 

137.64 147.39 B: i i'm not sure how how who you know what group of ah political people ah decide if there's going to be an increase in the minimum wage 

147.12 148.13 A: yeah 

147.41 153.17 B: but i'm sure if they took a vote on it they would find that most people ah would say it should be much higher 

152.67 160.47 A: right right and i hope that um like i said i mean i hope that it corresponds with some of the other things that have been happening um 

160.44 173.42 A: you know from state to state but i know only speaking from new york with the subway hike just going up this past week i would say that that would definitely be an indicator to warrant maybe raising that minimum wage 

171.69 184.69 B: well yeah and and that you know they're letting people go all over the schools and and yet yet at the same time they're offering people very high paying jobs so i mean i work in the school and there are people 

175.45 176.86 A: i know 

181.43 182.28 A: right 

184.62 195.17 B: ah that are i see are they live they're wait waiting for their pink slips whereas other people are now getting a very big raise because of the way they're reorganizing the whole system 

194.48 197.54 A: right ah it it just doesn't make sense does it 

196.71 203.57 B: so you know the person sitting next to you this could be a good thing for him and the next person is is is sh- shivering [mn] 

202.98 215.46 A: well then i'm wondering too if they're going to be more people um within that minimum wage bracket because there are so many people unemployed in this ah in new york i mean it's it's pretty it's pretty high right now 

215.13 216.49 B: right right 

215.67 220.35 A: and i don't see it i don't see it going down in the in the near future unfortunately 

219.37 228.70 B: who h- who knows the things that are happening [laughter] i find it's so surprising that i just i can't believe it i can't believe what's happening i just 

226.05 227.83 A: i know i know 

228.27 235.82 A: i know i i have to agree and i it i guess it would make sense for them to raise it i mean i hate to think of it that way but i i really 

234.83 239.24 B: i didn't realise it was five it was five fourteen i don't remember what she said 

237.68 240.12 A: yeah i yeah something like that 

239.36 242.10 B: i i didn't realise that's what it was 

241.50 250.37 A: i know i didn't i didn't either it just it seems ah you know i'm not always following what the minimum wage is but to hear what the what the figure is just 

247.76 248.59 B: (( no )) 

249.58 263.75 B: well i do know the last time i read an article about it in the paper that when it w- it was due for an increase that a lot of the politicians were against it for whatever reason they were against an increase and they you know gave their reasons why they were against it 

257.70 258.93 A: wow 

260.01 261.28 A: oh gosh 

263.14 267.93 A: gosh they can't like i can't continue [laughter] oh my goodness 

264.28 265.55 B: (( but ah )) 

266.94 269.99 B: it's i mean i don't know what's happening [laughter] 

269.21 282.15 A: you're right and i wonder that's a really good question i'm wondering how often it does come in to be revoted on or how often it's looked at and ah you know decided upon whether or not it'll be increased 

282.38 292.01 B: yeah well it's i i know there are people that get laid off and i im- i imagine someone that had a very high paying job they get such a as pay five and change an hour 

288.38 289.53 A: mhm 

291.81 293.31 A: oh no 

292.04 294.39 B: it's it's it's an outrage right 

293.79 301.39 A: i know i know it's it's absolutely absurd and you know like i was mentioning before i think it would be um 

301.57 311.42 A: without a doubt a really good idea to raise it considering um that there are so many people out of work and i have a feeling that that people are going to resort to ah 

311.52 315.92 A: jobs that probably don't pay as much as their previous jobs used to pay 

314.96 319.98 B: right well what can you do i mean w- it is it's ah the people are out starving 

316.48 317.80 A: right what can you do 

320.03 321.77 A: right absolutely 

320.21 328.02 B: there're pe- there are people ah that have haven't got a they live the ones that have a pay check they live from pay check to pay check 

328.06 331.36 B: and and that's how they live they don't have a penny to spare 

331.04 332.13 A: right 

331.57 334.49 B: and then when the there's an increase in the fare 

334.58 339.78 B: they they really don't have the money a lot of people i hear are going to walk they're going to start walking [laughter] 

339.95 341.06 A: wow 

342.04 343.13 A: wow 

342.52 344.70 B: it's it's you know not good 

343.42 350.07 A: well you know y- people have to do what they've got to do and you got to stand up for what you believe to be right 

350.30 351.17 B: well 

350.39 358.40 A: and unfortunately it's it's sad to see that people would even have to resort to have having to do that and 

358.52 362.15 A: i mean it people just shouldn't have to worry about their security that much 

361.87 366.91 B: well especially the elderly people you know they're they're not treated good in this country 

362.36 363.53 A: and jobs 

364.56 365.83 A: i know 

366.67 367.94 A: i know 

367.08 368.60 B: they're really not 

368.01 374.78 A: i know it's just terrible and i'm wondering how often um the minimum wage is actually 

374.68 388.97 B: i don't know i as i said before i i read about it every now i read the paper every day and i haven't read about it recently so i don't even know why they're asking this question i i haven't i don't have you recalled reading about it recently no i have 

381.72 382.82 A: yeah 

383.98 385.07 A: yeah 

387.27 398.57 A: no i actually it i actually haven't but it's interesting that it is coming up because that would be an interesting question at a time like this when so many people are being laid off 

398.61 403.94 A: um i i know the school district's under a lot of i mean just craziness 

403.98 405.45 A: that's been happening 

403.98 406.73 B: oh that's the word for it all right i 

405.88 410.08 A: and ah you know lay offs with the city has been huge 

411.17 412.41 A: um 

411.86 422.10 B: but even if i w- i'm wondering if that's saying how much of an increase is it is it five cents what how much of an increase they're giving now it 

419.94 421.02 A: yeah 

421.40 431.08 A: yeah i think i i think that's a really really good question and i'm and what is what is the amount that could actually make a difference i'm sure every little bit 

425.08 425.73 B: (( oh )) 

431.29 432.79 A: um matters 

431.42 440.83 B: well look if a person w- works say eight hours they're saying they make five in change i mean what's that forty dollars a day ah i that's yeah i i don't 

435.72 436.80 A: right 

438.05 440.39 A: right oh my goodness 

440.86 444.73 A: oh my goodness that really doesn't gosh that really doesn't amount to much 

440.99 441.53 B: (( ah )) 

442.23 450.46 B: you know unless they don't have to pay rent if they live in a box in the street maybe then they could manage i mean that's ridiculous 

445.43 446.38 A: yeah 

448.81 450.06 A: right 

450.13 451.59 A: right i won- 

450.64 453.36 B: some people don't even have a room to their name 

453.54 455.68 A: i know i know 

455.81 462.16 A: and i wonder if they rate it on a percentage or if they measure it against ah cost of living 

459.27 462.04 B: i i i d- i d- i don't know 

462.06 470.14 B: i know even when you read something that what what you read is not always true they'll tell you half a story you don't get the you know the real picture about anything 

469.84 471.48 A: right exactly 

470.75 473.64 B: you only know what they tell you so ah 

472.49 479.57 A: that's right that's right that's definite that's definitely true i mean i can i can definitely see that i just don't 

476.37 477.22 B: well 

479.74 488.15 A: my gosh i just don't know how they i mean it's funny because i watch ah at my local sort of bodega deli it's it's ah in brooklyn um 

488.24 494.96 A: all the little kids sort of go there and work for for change in their bags to to pack the bags and 

491.14 492.17 B: right 

492.26 493.87 B: right ye- 

494.18 505.86 B: right they do this at at pas- pasmark they chase the kids away they're not supposed to do that but they come over to you and say can i help you put that in and you g- you know give them a quarter or whatever but they don't want them doing that 

498.77 500.06 A: yeah they're 

503.00 504.13 A: right 

505.29 513.99 A: right and here they i don't they don't employ them but they just allow the kids to kind of work out for their own goodwill for change and 

510.59 511.84 B: right 

512.49 515.30 B: well yeah but some stores don't allow that you know that's 

514.57 516.33 A: i know it's ah 

516.43 519.90 A: god and i i can't i can't even imagine 

520.00 528.65 A: um having to faced with all these increases and knowing that you wouldn't get an increase in your wage it seems that it would have to be 

528.80 534.88 A: they'd have to be significant jumps every from time to time because i don't think it changes yearly 

534.21 540.49 B: yeah but i don't think it's going to happen [laughter] i think not in this economic climate it's not going to happen 

536.34 538.17 A: i don't think it is either 

539.96 546.13 A: right i don't think it is either which will cause a lot of people to actually leave the city and leave 

541.97 542.85 B: (( it's it is )) 

545.41 547.23 B: you're right right 

546.22 550.25 A: leave new york particularly expensive places like new york 

550.01 554.52 B: well where do you go though oh isn't it ex- more or less expensive everywhere 

554.68 556.90 A: yeah i i guess maybe it's 

555.54 558.18 B: maybe the mid west i don't i don't [laughter] 

556.99 562.15 A: maybe yeah maybe i mean i guess the cost of living can have a tendency to be expensive 

560.11 570.03 B: well yes the ah ah there's an elderly teacher in my school she retired she said she has like a mansion and she pays s- so little rent it's in kansas city 

569.67 570.45 A: (( oh [laughter] )) 

570.25 573.42 B: but she's so unhappy there she's you know 

572.13 574.32 A: oh gosh 

574.58 575.56 B: but she 

574.66 578.84 A: right i mean there there isn't maybe necessarily a lot of things to do and 

578.02 583.19 B: no but imagine from new york going to live in kansas city a woman in her eighties 

580.59 581.83 A: oh yeah that's 

582.51 586.17 A: [laughter] that's a big change 

584.14 584.93 B: that's 

585.29 589.90 B: well she her son is there so she wanted to be near her son but she's going crazy 

587.07 587.99 A: oh 

589.33 592.97 A: oh gosh at new york to kansas is a big change 

592.75 595.50 B: i would say so i mean i've never been there but it 

594.48 598.90 A: and yeah you i mean your lower cost of living of course but ah 

597.81 599.89 B: yeah but so what i mean ah 

599.04 599.89 A: yeah [laughter]
