0.70 2.57 B: hello i'm sabrina 

0.85 1.91 A: (( hello )) 

2.64 4.07 A: hello i'm monica 

3.90 4.78 B: hi 

4.61 5.51 A: hi 

6.54 8.48 B: um [sigh] do you feel that the 

8.50 11.84 B: um minimum wage would be enough at five dollars 

11.30 19.32 A: ah not where i live i think ah in our right now in our area they're trying to fight over for the living wage going on 

18.17 19.13 B: uh-huh 

19.17 28.83 A: you know 'cause the people are just not cutting it on the minimum wage i mean it's it's i mean the cost of living is very high you know it's the you know the groceries and stuff like that uh 

22.31 23.26 B: right 

26.29 27.81 B: yeah i think 

28.53 30.50 B: yeah where do you live at what state 

30.29 32.33 A: we live in te- in texas 

31.71 36.23 B: uh-huh i live in colorado and the cost of living here is really high too 

35.54 37.76 A: oh yeah yeah it is i had a 

36.65 39.04 B: so at five dollars [laughter] 

38.81 41.10 A: that's nothing really [laughter] 

39.75 46.41 B: yeah even a two income family at five dollars at fulltime i don't think that's enough 

45.92 47.51 A: (( uh-uh uh-uh )) 

47.18 49.35 B: no not to ever get ahead and 

49.95 58.72 B: you know just barely maybe making it month to month but if anything ever happened that you know yeah that could financially ruin 'em 

54.30 58.21 A: the car breaks down or you know a couple of extras 

58.47 63.86 A: yeah yeah i think you need to raise it a little higher than that i have a sister that's uh 

63.81 75.16 A: that's going to college right now and she's y- you know working with the school you know but it's on minimum wage and it's not enough to pay like bills and and gas and stuff like that she's having a hard time 

68.12 69.14 B: mhm 

72.19 73.23 B: right 

74.83 79.70 B: right uh yeah i can't imagine even trying to pay daycare [laughter] with minimum wage 

78.03 79.31 A: oh yeah 

79.59 81.20 A: oh and forget that 

80.94 82.12 B: yeah 

82.13 95.40 A: and i you know if they're gonna do this i think they're gonna have to come up with they're probably the government's gonna end paying like for the daycare and this and that which means that the people that are paying tax are gonna be paying more i guess right to have all this stuff 

89.47 90.39 B: yeah 

95.24 99.83 B: yeah it would definitely be the taxpayers that would have to pick up the extra 

96.04 97.17 A: paid for 

99.48 101.58 A: yeah yeah which 

100.66 103.11 B: which doesn't really get anybody ahead 

102.78 104.22 A: yeah yeah 

103.25 105.27 B: you know in the long run because 

105.55 107.89 B: you're all everybody's still paying when 

107.91 110.12 B: the company should just be paying more 

109.86 112.48 A: yeah yeah 

111.32 118.91 B: and it's not like most companies can't afford you know a few dollars extra an hour 'cause i think most of 'em honestly can 

118.73 126.23 A: yeah they can they can i mean 'cause you you know they're they're making more you know tha- than they ever have you know before now you know 

124.73 125.75 B: mhm 

126.60 128.45 B: they just would have to watch their 

126.63 127.49 A: so 

128.49 130.59 B: budget somewhere else and 

130.79 138.11 B: i don't know i think money talks too it would make employees happier and more dedicated to the job and 

130.87 132.05 A: yeah 

138.55 143.42 A: you're gonna s- see a lot more smiles at work [laughter] [laughter] 

140.90 147.43 B: definitely [laughter] i'm a registered nurse so i definitely don't make minimum wage but the amount that 

147.76 149.36 B: i do make 

149.37 153.11 B: i think should be more [laughter] of course everybody thinks they need paid more 

150.86 154.41 A: yeah yeah yeah 

153.37 156.96 B: but i know people skip from job to job and 

157.12 164.09 B: you know as nurses because you know this place pays more and this other place has a sign on bonus so yeah 

163.01 164.91 A: oh yeah little extras right 

164.47 166.71 B: uh-huh and so i know 

167.24 171.82 B: money seems to keep employees happy of course if you can pay your bills [laughter] 

171.26 172.84 A: yeah yeah 

172.22 174.39 B: then you have that less stress 

175.63 181.98 B: yeah and how sad is it that um people on minimum wage you know they have babies and then they have to buy formula 

182.83 184.00 A: yeah 

183.05 184.44 B: on top of 

184.46 185.91 B: the daycare 

185.72 187.65 A: yeah 

186.62 188.46 B: that's expensive too 

188.35 194.27 A: but then you have these people that aren't actually working right and they get all the free stuff from the government 

192.03 192.84 B: right 

194.03 195.22 B: yeah 

194.46 204.61 A: but then you have all these people that are on the minimum wage you know that are barely trying to get everything you know the formula and clothing and daycare paid for and the government doesn't want to help them 

201.12 202.28 B: yeah 

204.53 206.15 B: uh that's very true 

206.04 210.74 A: so they're like caught you know in between they need to raise it up they need to raise it up [laughter] they need to 

207.86 208.86 B: yeah 

209.60 212.58 B: yeah it is almost like better off not working 

212.43 213.96 A: yes that's true 

212.86 225.04 B: because if it comes down to you can't feed your kid or if you're just barely making it and you could be living so much better if you don't work um that's no incentive to work [laughter] yeah i certainly wouldn't 

220.30 221.59 A: yeah 

222.97 224.60 A: yeah well the 

224.83 230.47 A: yeah like i have a a sister in law that's in that same that was in the same boat that she wa- she didn't work for a whole year 

230.18 231.17 B: mhm 

230.81 232.66 A: because she got everything for free 

232.31 233.20 B: (( mhm )) 

233.04 240.33 A: well to me my husband and i were like what [laughter] you need to be out there working to support your son and you know try to make a better life for yourself 

235.44 236.47 B: yeah 

239.98 241.71 B: yeah definitely 

240.36 244.59 A: you know but she had a good time you know reaping the benefits from the government 

244.31 245.08 B: yeah 

245.33 247.01 B: and i know it's hard once 

247.57 252.48 B: to once people start getting benefits it's hard to stop it's hard to get o- out of that 

252.06 254.15 A: yeah it is 

253.01 257.65 B: that mindset of 'cause i don't know i had a child when i was a teenager 

257.40 258.33 A: uh-huh 

258.01 265.66 B: and i got government benefits for a while but i kind of used it to my advantage i had the government pay for me to go to college 

265.25 267.14 A: yeah yeah 

266.52 267.51 B: and 

267.54 268.53 B: yeah 

268.62 273.36 B: i got some money from the government but in the long run i think it paid off 

273.25 287.18 A: yeah but it's just that you have people that wanna do that you know that wanna get out they don't wanna be you know the government supporting them but then you have the other ones that they couldn't care less [noise] [noise] they don't wanna get out you know they don't wanna do better than you know what they have now 

276.64 277.92 B: yeah 

282.27 283.25 B: right 

285.91 291.46 B: right until their kid is eighteen that's what they're gonna do [laughter] yeah that's true 

288.62 291.00 A: yeah yeah 

291.43 292.91 A: so it's like yeah 

292.43 296.34 B: well maybe with those people it wouldn't even help raising the minimum wage 

296.33 298.24 A: yeah 

296.90 298.82 B: they probably wouldn't care 

298.47 300.57 A: they wouldn't care [laughter] but 

299.63 309.20 B: but you know what if it did for some people if it made it i don't know if it made a difference for some people to work or not to work i think it would be worth raising it 

309.18 310.86 A: yeah 

309.37 312.31 B: to at least eight dollars or something an hour 

311.47 315.76 A: i mean a little m- more worthwhile than that i'm like god 

313.72 314.84 B: yeah 

315.38 320.01 B: some incentive to drag your butt out of bed in the morning and actually go to work 

319.38 329.40 A: yeah nobody wants to work for five dollars i don't think so [laughter] [laughter] uh my sister was doing a part time job you know working at a daycare 

323.60 325.17 B: (( uh-uh [laughter] )) 

325.89 327.21 B: no way 

329.17 330.20 B: uh-huh 

329.38 340.91 A: and they were paying these teachers uh the minimum wage and i mean they had like twenty kids per class and she would she would come out of work you know dragging she's like it's not worth it it it i'm like well it's not 

332.22 333.36 B: (( oh )) 

335.96 337.39 B: wow [laughter] 

341.08 342.96 B: mm mm definitely not 

341.57 346.44 A: (( it's not worth it and i go these teachers need to get paid more than that and they go i don't think so )) 

346.29 349.80 B: especially what that daycare was probably charging the parents 

349.47 350.97 A: oh yeah yeah 

350.11 354.27 B: you know of course they could pay more it it's just all about profit 

354.11 360.12 A: yeah and i told my sister you you you need to talk to the owner and tell him to do something because it's not fair for you guys 

359.92 361.02 B: yeah 

360.54 365.72 A: they do a lot of work and you know w- and they come out dragging [laughter] at the end of the day 

364.57 367.73 B: yeah dealing with kids all day definitely [laughter] 

366.97 369.34 A: yeah and i'm like golly 

369.22 370.13 B: (( [laughter] )) 

369.98 371.17 A: [laughter] 

371.89 374.63 B: have you ever had a minimum wage job 

374.76 377.41 A: uh n- no 

377.25 384.89 B: hm see i did when i very first started working i worked at a taco bell for [laughter] for minimum wage 

378.08 378.91 A: (( no )) 

380.64 381.46 A: (( oh oh )) 

382.39 384.20 A: okay okay 

385.04 396.43 A: no i i've worked in the mostly like in the school district area and then i used to work well actually i did kind of work the minimum wage kind of sort of but it was a little bit higher i used to work in a casino 

388.37 389.51 B: oh okay 

394.66 395.52 B: uh-huh 

396.21 397.29 B: oh okay 

397.02 400.33 A: so it was like higher than the minimum wage i think i ended up 

400.58 402.44 A: with eight something an hour 

402.40 404.47 B: oh that's not bad 

403.54 405.61 A: plus tips you know so 

405.04 406.29 B: yeah 

406.01 408.51 A: it was it was pretty good [laughter] 

407.86 410.38 B: yeah plus tips would be good [laughter] 

409.57 411.86 A: with yeah yeah so 

410.65 412.56 B: yeah definitely 

413.38 414.53 A: but i never had a 

413.47 415.32 B: i know when i did minimum wage 

415.53 422.15 B: it was mostly just going to work to have fun with my friends but and i didn't have to pay rent at the time 

421.72 422.87 A: yeah 

422.64 430.33 B: but i remember my little tiny paychecks [laughter] it's like man that was a fulltime week [laughter] [laughter] 

425.26 426.77 A: [laughter] 

427.93 432.49 A: [laughter] you're like [laughter] yeah i know [laughter] 

431.46 433.93 B: [laughter] what am i supposed to do with this [laughter] 

433.72 438.45 A: (( [laughter] yeah and it's just like it's what [laughter] yeah it's )) 

435.28 438.19 B: go buy some makeup or something [laughter] 

438.94 440.97 A: not enough it's not enough 

439.78 440.89 B: (( mm mm )) 

441.08 444.54 B: no not if somebody's seriously trying to support a family 

444.15 453.64 A: yeah yeah i mean you have all these people around the area that have so many kids and you know only one parent is working it's a minimum wage j- job and you know 

453.72 455.14 B: mhm 

454.19 456.42 A: they're doing the best they can i guess but 

455.79 461.84 B: and the cost of food keeps going up the car you know gas the gas prices oh my gosh those are just 

457.57 459.60 A: (( i know [laughter] )) 

462.53 463.92 B: you can barely even 

464.14 467.39 B: on minimum wage probably pay for gas to go to work 

466.76 474.98 A: i know i know i know like over here in uh in where we're living there's only like one main grocery chain store here 

474.50 475.43 B: uh-huh 

475.28 484.09 A: and it's like oh i hate going there 'cause it's so expensive we came home with one bag of groceries and it's about forty fifty dollars i'm like what did i buy you know 

478.46 479.56 B: yeah 

481.71 482.87 B: wow 

483.46 484.69 B: yeah 

484.53 486.72 A: god it's not worth it 

485.41 488.40 B: but if that's the only store then what choice [laughter] 

487.75 490.03 A: yeah [laughter] 

489.16 492.67 B: that or drive maybe out of town which isn't real convenient 

492.43 502.17 A: yeah but i mean like this grocery store uh the chain store here it's like mostly all of texas like the south texas part area they've like overrun the area 

499.28 500.22 B: uh-huh 

501.78 503.19 B: oh wow 

502.56 505.62 A: so i mean oh or you can go to 

504.08 506.28 B: so you pay their prices [laughter] 

505.80 510.06 A: yeah but i mean these are like to the super centers or walmart or target you know 

510.27 511.74 A: so they're a little bit better 

510.29 511.85 B: oh yeah that's true 

512.44 515.21 A: (( so um but yeah and they're like oh )) 

513.48 514.40 B: yeah 

515.33 515.98 B: (( [laughter] )) 

515.45 517.35 A: very expensive 

516.70 520.31 B: yeah and they don't actually look for cost of living to go down 

520.91 522.72 A: yeah 

521.00 523.54 B: anywhere 'cause i know it hasn't here 

523.77 525.60 A: 'cause i know colorado's pretty expensive 

523.83 526.48 B: the cost of living keeps going up [laughter] 

525.85 528.10 A: yeah i know colorado's real expensive right 

527.78 529.08 B: yeah it is 

528.56 534.58 A: i had a some cousins of mine that were living up there and they just like they wanted to get back to texas because it was too expensive over there 

534.60 536.07 B: yeah it's 

536.11 541.11 B: except for maybe like the very rural parts that there's nothing [laughter] 

540.90 543.49 A: oh okay [laughter] 

542.16 544.82 B: but i know the properties are very expensive 

544.44 545.84 A: yeah 

546.22 547.34 B: there's no way 

546.24 547.39 A: god 

547.77 548.85 B: yeah 

549.77 554.17 B: crazy what they i don't know the government i think should step in and 

554.72 556.82 B: and do something finally 

555.65 559.66 A: and what they should do maybe is work with the companies and say okay we'll match your 

559.67 565.87 A: you know match it you know fifteen percent or twenty percent or something you know give it some kind of incentive you know 

562.97 564.76 B: yeah that would be a good idea 

565.59 566.66 B: yeah 

566.73 568.87 B: then companies may be more willing 

568.70 570.30 A: yeah yeah 

569.90 572.45 B: to do that even though they should be 

570.72 578.99 A: start little by little or something if they were going to do this incentive for so many years until you guys know that it's gonna work out that you're gonna be able to pay it out you know 

572.61 573.62 B: yeah 

578.62 579.68 B: mhm 

579.60 581.64 A: something to make 'em more i don't know 

582.09 586.58 A: not too scared of putting in you know giving more money to to their employees or something 

586.33 588.30 B: right at least give it a try 

587.92 594.68 A: yeah yeah like on a trial basis just for so many years or something like that they should 

590.30 591.25 B: yeah 

593.98 594.72 B: (( uh-huh )) 

594.85 596.01 B: be hard to 

596.53 599.36 B: force a company to do that probably but 

598.63 599.89 A: yeah yeah
