281.98 283.87 B: it's terrible [mn] 

286.05 289.44 A: [mn] where what uh part of where are you located 

288.23 290.01 B: [noise] [mn] i'm in nebraska

292.13 295.17 B: texas yeah [mn] 

292.73 299.19 A: mhm yup i'm in dallas so [mn] i don't know is is minimum wage five thirty five out there as well 

298.73 300.37 B: yeah i think so 

299.89 303.44 A: oh so it's like pretty much across the board or something oh okay 

301.14 312.28 B: [noise] i think so yeah i know that um until recently most of the employers around were paying a lot more [mn] because they couldn't find enough employees but 

303.81 304.37 A: (( [noise] )) 

308.17 309.63 A: mhm 

311.51 313.66 A: (( mm mhm )) 

312.59 318.89 B: it seems like lately it's it's gone the other direction where there's a lot of people looking for jobs 

317.66 319.72 A: [noise] right right 

319.87 332.25 A: yeah so [noise] yeah but i don't know i [mn] i i think it's ridi- like i said i think it's ridiculous i mean the cost of everything else is just going up [mn] uh seem to be at a rapid rate 

331.94 333.04 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

332.41 346.79 A: i i think that that that is [mn] i mean if we're if we are seriously moved to [noise] um move people [noise] from welfare to work and that type of thing i think that that that needs to be seriously considered and to and and adjusted 

334.83 335.39 B: (( [noise] )) 

341.29 342.22 B: right 

345.92 356.19 B: [mn] yeah i mean it's hard when you think about it because [mn] you know i know a couple of people who own small business and that have you know [mn] three or four employees and 

356.42 365.66 B: you look at what they are able to pay people in benefits or [mn] in wages and they're really worried about the minimum wage increase 

360.73 361.80 A: mhm 

365.21 366.44 A: mhm 

365.65 372.40 B: because you know they will literally have to let one of their people go unless they cut benefits on all of them 

371.84 374.09 A: mm wow really 

372.67 385.03 B: and it's like you know so [mn] in addition to minimum wage needing to go up they need to give some help to small businesses i seriously think we should start this maximum wage idea [laughter] it'll be like okay look 

379.18 380.49 A: right 

382.40 386.42 A: (( [laughter] )) 

385.30 393.28 B: a million bucks a year is it [laughter] you know [laughter] if you're gonna make more than that you have to give it away [mn] 

387.78 389.90 A: right right yeah 

392.36 395.09 A: right exactly you's right [noise] 

393.56 398.46 B: i mean i am sorry what how ridiculous that you need that amount of money [laughter] [mn] [mn] [noise] 

398.35 412.91 A: [mn] ah you know we were [laughter] a friend of mine was in my garage last night and he was a he's a uh computer programmer [mn] and he [noise] was talking about his boss he was you know talking about being one of the only people to have ever been in his boss' house [mn] [lipsmack] 

412.83 427.28 A: but anyway he went on to say that his boss and his and his bosses wife it's just the two of them [mn] have a one point five million dollar home [mn] and you know [mn] with all these rooms and all these thin- and and just nothing else to do i mean 

420.61 421.90 B: oh my goodness 

427.44 431.55 A: see that's what i'm talking about [mn] this is i mean you know 

431.38 438.25 B: [laughter] you could move ten families into that house [laughter] you know [laughter] jeez 

431.83 432.71 A: i 

433.82 438.04 A: i right exactly you [laughter] 

437.96 451.49 A: right i'm just saying man you know [mn] e- you know i guess on the one hand if i was [mn] in that upper echelon [laughter] i might feel a little differently [laughter] [mn] exactly you know i'm like 

443.82 453.44 B: [noise] yeah i might feel i might feel different if i was pulling down a million a year you know what i mean i may say don't you touch my millions 

452.90 465.85 A: right [laughter] [mn] i might feel differently but as it stands now [laughter] i think there needs to be a cap [laughter] 

453.90 454.99 B: [laughter] 

455.44 457.67 B: [mn] uh yeah 

458.35 460.79 B: (( [laughter] )) 

461.98 469.84 B: i think so too you know they cap everything else i think they should just say okay dz that's it that's it you're done 

467.67 473.32 A: (( [laughter] [laughter] [mn] yeah [laughter] [mn] right you know [mn] i mean so and when you )) 

470.41 471.24 B: (( [laughter] you know )) 

471.83 476.81 B: [mn] if you cannot live off a million dollars a year you have a serious problem [mn] 

475.98 488.28 A: [noise] right you know and when you think about it i mean i guess the [noise] the people at the top are making the hard decisions but the people at the bottom are the ones working [laughter] 

483.95 489.49 B: yeah they're the ones breaking their backs so mr millionaire can live in his

511.34 513.02 B: (( [laughter] [mn] yeah that's ))
