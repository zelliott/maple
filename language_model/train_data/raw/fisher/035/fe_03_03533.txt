49.57 51.62 B: ed [laughter] 

50.79 55.74 A: and that the topic was was minimum wage what do you think about the minimum wage going to five dollars an hour 

56.28 63.08 B: [laughter] you know i live in canada so i don't know where um [laughter] 

58.95 60.50 A: [laughter] 

62.41 68.17 A: well i'm a small business employer and i feel f- five dollars is still too low [laughter] 

68.11 76.29 B: well er well if you're gonna ask me minimum wage um jeeze i i i haven't made minimum wage uh since i was in high school [sigh] 

75.53 77.35 A: (( oh wow [laughter] )) 

76.49 81.82 B: [laughter] you know so um that's a long ways away for me [laughter] 

80.77 83.83 A: is is there a such a thing as a minimum wage in canada 

83.52 86.50 B: yes there is but i believe it's uh somewhere 

87.05 97.24 B: um i don't know it's about uh seven dollars or something which is about thirty cents american i think [laughter] [laughter] 

90.64 91.49 A: uh-huh 

93.47 95.93 A: uh oh [laughter] 

96.46 98.63 A: wow [laughter] 

97.66 107.78 B: [sigh] well i think minimum wage is um you know [sigh] um i hated it when i was working because um you know you had uh other people making a lot more than you were 

107.49 108.48 A: mhm 

107.79 119.03 B: but since i was a student i i didn't think it was fair because it uh we were do we were all doing the same work so i couldn't understand why i would be paid lower than than the others 

113.59 115.17 A: the same work right 

118.74 126.82 A: see now i i don't believe in in what you're saying there i don't believe in that practice if you're hired for a job you should be paid the same as the other people doing it 

123.01 123.97 B: mhm 

125.99 128.40 B: yeah yeah exactly [mn] 

126.84 133.63 A: now mini- minimum wage should be used only for certain jobs and everyone that does that job gets minimum wage 

133.30 140.26 B: well i [sigh] i'd even take it a step further i think that uh minimum wage should only be for um 

140.32 143.70 B: uh companies who are just starting [sigh] you know 

142.79 143.62 A: uh-huh 

144.13 146.70 B: and i think um 

146.80 149.26 B: if uh they get bigger 

149.28 150.30 A: mhm 

149.76 156.92 B: i don't think they should be paying minimum wage because minimum wage i don't think you can afford anything these days [laughter] [laughter] you know 

155.26 157.98 A: [laughter] [laughter] well not much i will agree [laughter] 

157.33 158.64 B: [laughter] 

158.84 171.61 B: you know so and i and i also think that um if you want your business to flourish then um get like happier workers i don't think anyone would be happy making minimum wage [laughter] [noise] 

167.31 168.57 A: mhm 

171.00 182.60 A: no i don't no not happy you're right i i mean i agree with that um [mn] the only way you can you can make minimum wage even uh survivable is to put benefits with it it's there's really no way you can do it 

179.00 179.92 B: (( hm )) 

181.18 182.07 B: right 

182.60 186.81 A: and then really the minimum wage goes up because the benefits cost money 

186.73 192.15 B: yeah but then i d- i don't know any company who would pay minimum wage and um 

192.30 199.07 B: include benefits i thought those who uh pays minimum wage are those um who doesn't want to pay period [laughter] 

193.22 194.27 A: a benefit 

198.40 203.14 A: see now i i know some i mean you you take take one of the largest corporations in the world mcdonalds 

202.81 203.91 B: mhm 

203.31 206.48 A: they will start you know their kids at minimum wage 

206.18 207.35 B: mhm 

206.60 212.62 A: but they will offer them a uh it's it's their part time people a part time insurance programme 

212.45 213.93 B: oh i see okay 

213.17 217.41 A: or or an incentive programme to to try to get them to become a full time employee 

217.04 218.25 B: mhm 

217.64 221.47 A: you know i mean they do offer that so there are many companies that do that stuff 

221.12 222.33 B: mhm 

221.68 229.78 A: but it it's done on a a pro rated type basis you know because you're not a full time employee so you're you're only getting part time benefits 

229.69 230.72 B: mhm 

230.10 234.50 A: which really takes the minimum wage it puts it higher i mean disney does the same thing down in florida 

234.65 236.12 B: oh i see okay 

234.91 239.48 A: you know they they take college kids and they bring them in there disney pays them a dollar an hour 

240.23 245.18 A: the the government subsidizes it at five dollars an hour which brings them up to six dollars an hour 

245.23 246.42 B: mhm 

245.74 250.55 A: but then disney turns around and because their college students that come w- you know and work there 

250.57 253.20 A: disney puts them up uh in 

253.48 256.38 A: wh- wh- what's called a low income housing type thing 

256.25 257.30 B: mhm 

256.70 263.27 A: um so the students have a place to stay disney feeds them that's part of their job or part of their pay 

261.95 263.35 B: (( i see mhm [lipsmack] )) 

263.39 268.88 A: you know and disney gives them a meal ticket while they're there so they they work in the park and they go to school 

269.67 273.41 A: but their their actual wage comes closer to eleven dollars an hour 

273.49 276.48 A: when you figure in the benefits that they give them 

276.04 277.64 B: oh i see okay 

277.02 282.15 A: yeah but but when you first look at it you're only getting a dollar an hour that's ridiculous [laughter] 

281.44 288.05 B: hm right uh well that's what i mean most companies um who tries to um 

282.51 284.32 A: [laughter] but you get 

285.60 286.45 A: yeah 

288.37 294.92 B: [sigh] i don't know if it's uh if you can even call it that cutthroat um [laughter] but uh 

292.66 293.93 A: [laughter] 

294.15 296.03 A: kind of [laughter] mhm 

295.27 303.48 B: yeah i guess [laughter] you know uh but uh up here anyways uh most companies that i've i i've worked for working for minimum wage 

301.01 302.08 A: mhm 

303.68 304.66 B: uh 

304.78 311.91 B: you could even hear the bosses talking about it you know a new new guy coming in and uh you know they try and avoid uh 

312.01 313.03 A: paying the extra 

312.29 319.29 B: paying them [laughter] you know same where er they tell us to um not to uh say anything how much they're uh paying us 

313.25 314.06 A: sure 

318.78 320.21 A: (( uh-huh oh )) 

319.79 332.97 B: you know and i said well what's there to tell we're all making [laughter] minimum wage [laughter] [laughter] you know so uh uh but but what i meant is uh you know sometimes um i i i could still remember when there was um 

324.79 325.85 A: [laughter] 

333.23 341.91 B: a a a vietnamese fella who came in and you know up 'til now i still wonder if um the boss were um 

335.23 337.67 A: (( mm )) 

342.34 351.32 B: you know are st- the guy was just happy to have a job so m- maybe the guy er the boss was uh paying him uh you know below minimum wage even 

345.48 346.31 A: sure 

350.97 353.22 A: (( mhm mm )) 

351.60 358.00 B: because there were people um here who has been found uh you know uh not paying even the minimum wage 

357.62 358.81 A: yeah 

358.30 361.68 B: and they do get hefty fines but you know [noise] 

360.55 365.73 A: mhm see i don't pay minimum like i say i i'm a small business owner i own a a sound business 

365.71 379.51 A: and i don't pay minimum wage i pay above that but i i paid on a more of a uh contractual basis in other words that they that they're working basically on there er as a sub contractor to me so they're paid cash from me 

368.18 369.16 B: mhm 

372.00 373.09 B: oh i see 

377.15 378.22 B: mhm 

379.77 383.32 A: so that you know they're actually making eight to ten dollars an hour 

379.89 380.93 B: right 

383.11 384.91 B: right 

384.00 386.89 A: um and it's up to them to report it 

387.17 388.52 B: mhm 

387.89 391.85 A: that way i don't even mess with the government [laughter] 

389.89 391.32 B: (( right um )) 

391.47 395.42 B: well you know i'd uh i work on the side too um you know

399.79 402.63 B: you know what i want to do with it of course um 

402.66 405.04 B: but then again uh i 

405.06 411.25 B: i think you guys down there are a lot better when it comes to uh paying taxes though up here it's like um 

411.29 419.85 B: th- the government uh takes almost half of what you [laughter] make and at the end of the year they want more from you [laughter] you know yeah 

414.94 416.06 A: oh wow 

417.53 418.71 A: they want more 

419.26 423.38 A: yeah see we at least get to write reductions off so we get a little bit back
