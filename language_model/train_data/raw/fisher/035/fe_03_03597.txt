9.75 10.91 B: oh really 

10.57 12.37 A: yeah and we're up in 

11.27 16.45 B: i don't know anybody named theresa [laughter] [laughter] no [laughter] 

13.44 14.94 A: oh no oh 

15.41 19.16 A: um we're in the new york area up state 

18.79 24.01 B: okay i'm in california and southern california so we're 

20.49 22.37 A: (( ah so )) 

22.87 24.26 A: oh great area 

24.12 26.42 B: far apart [laughter] 

25.55 32.58 A: [laughter] um yes and i'm not quite certain of all the details of this but this is the second call i've had um 

31.56 32.97 B: (( yeah mine too )) 

33.39 36.01 A: so let's see the topic minimum wage 

36.26 42.57 A: well i i don't have to work for a minimum wage but i can't imagine living on it 

36.31 37.18 B: um 

42.59 51.48 B: no i can't either i i i think i don't know what if it's a state law or something but i think where i live the minimum wage is actually six twenty five 

51.70 61.59 B: and i don't know if it's just um like a like i said like a state law or a county law or something but even that you know is i don't even think enough 

61.64 63.53 A: yeah i think the federal 

61.99 64.45 B: (( except to be able to support yourself )) 

64.33 77.47 A: yeah i think the federal i think you're right there the federal minimum is five fifteen states can mandate higher which i'm i i'm certain california would be one that that should um cost of living is a little higher out there 

76.86 78.62 B: yeah 

77.82 81.00 A: um so i would expect it to be a little higher but 

81.11 83.73 A: yeah even six twenty five in [mn] 

83.93 87.32 A: in california how can how can you live on that 

86.76 88.83 B: oh i exactly i mean 

88.70 97.17 B: i know i worked for um a human resources department for several years and um most of the people that we had working for us you know we paid a lot of people ah 

97.10 111.07 B: six twenty five we work on a college campus and did a lot of the hiring for like the restaurants and book stores and stuff that were on campus and mostly everyone that worked for us you know was um were students and they were working for the six twenty five the 

110.96 113.70 B: you know aside from that 

111.91 115.94 A: well yeah but their parents are probably paying their tuition that six twenty five is 

114.03 120.71 B: their parents are paying everything else and i'm sure that's just just a step on that you know whatever they want to do 

116.71 117.55 A: right 

118.62 120.87 A: yeah well that's their party money [laughter] 

121.17 122.20 B: but 

122.70 135.49 B: you know it's i i mean think that you know probably for like a college student or a high school student or someone who's just you know working for a little extra money that's probably fine but when you're trying to like support at least yourself not to mention if you've got kids in the mix 

135.20 136.38 A: exactly 

135.76 138.50 B: you know there's i don't know how you could do it 

138.67 139.57 A: well 

139.83 144.52 A: i i i don't i don't either i mean i can't imagine being stuck in that situation 

144.59 148.75 A: i i struggle now making fourteen dollars an hour with a mortage and 

147.70 150.83 B: right right exactly 

149.19 150.13 A: and 

150.36 155.98 A: and i can't you know i work a full forty hour week for fourteen dollars an hour and i still struggle so 

156.50 163.06 A: i mean there's no extra money to go on vacations i haven't been on a vacation since i toured the country in ninety six 

162.96 164.44 B: yeah 

164.17 165.07 A: um 

164.55 172.36 B: yeah that's i mean i don't know we just i me and my husband myself we just we just got out of school so we're just getting into the work force 

172.49 182.22 B: um well we worked to put ourselves through school you know like studying to like actually you know like work full time and you know not everything and 

180.15 181.02 A: right 

182.46 191.49 B: it's it's tough you know you've got you've got student loans to pay for you know most people go to school you know college i think you know nowadays and you know 

191.32 199.28 B: you have to get financial aid to get that so you've got a student loan you've got you know your mortgage you know if you were lucky enough to be able to get one 

199.29 202.57 B: you know or your rent for your apartment and then you've got 

199.38 200.32 A: right 

202.95 210.94 B: car you know transportation costs and food but i really don't know what what the government would be able to do to 

210.91 219.31 B: really change that because if the government was to mandate a raise you know what would happen with the smaller companies that can't afford to pay people more 

219.58 221.67 B: than you know the minimum wage 

219.91 220.76 A: well 

221.26 224.17 A: exactly and you might come into a situation where 

224.60 234.62 A: only only the larger companies are are benefitting and therefore monopolizing further the country um and and further demeaning the 

231.00 232.31 B: that's true 

234.63 236.51 A: the little person um 

237.87 245.29 A: i think there should be um a greater push for for college and financial aid because i don't believe everybody goes to college 

245.31 248.40 B: right not not nearly enough 

246.46 250.55 A: i'm in my mid to late thirties and i am just now going to college 

250.44 252.75 B: yeah exactly i'm not 

251.15 253.16 A: and with a mortage i 

252.90 254.55 B: it's hard 

253.98 257.85 A: mean i'm not eligible for financial aid because i make too much working 

257.84 259.12 B: right 

258.90 260.17 A: so if i had a child 

259.21 260.09 B: and i 

260.37 263.21 A: then i would be eligible for financial aid but [laughter] 

263.26 270.45 B: it's it's kind of funny because they i think they just it's definitely concerning like financial aid and stuff they just look at the numbers 

270.49 274.94 B: and you know it's not necessarily reflecting the true situation 

270.55 271.48 A: mhm 

275.22 281.77 B: you know um w- i when i was going when i was going to college like right when i got out of high school you know my 

275.50 276.33 A: right 

281.73 292.44 B: i was still considered a dependant on my parents and so we had to go off of what they made and my dad you know he made too much but they didn't make nearly enough to help me i had to put myself through school 

292.59 301.67 B: so y- i that was you know that was really hard but it was something that i knew that you know i i needed to do if i was going to be able to provide for myself and my children later on 

301.75 306.41 A: right exactly and i haven't had children because ah you know i couldn't imagine having to go to something 

307.22 313.74 A: like minimum wage i mean [laughter] if if i were to make even if i had the california rate here in new york 

308.87 310.10 B: yeah 

313.87 320.94 A: at six twenty five an hour the only way i could accept six twenty five an hour is if it was going to be 

321.15 323.56 A: um a tipping position you know 

323.25 325.94 B: right like a like a waitress or something 

325.33 326.28 A: right 

326.15 335.06 B: i think that um the minimum wage i think it's it's kind of a bad situation also because i think it puts a lot of pressure on like government um supplements 

326.52 327.26 A: right 

335.21 342.48 B: they have to you know i think that when the minimum wage is so low and so many people are working for a minimum wage they have to rely on things like you know social 

341.92 343.34 A: welfare and 

342.50 353.78 B: security or welfare food stamps and things like that i think that puts a further strain on the resources of the government so i wonder if it would just be better for them to you know maybe subsidize the companies to pay a little bit more 

354.45 364.17 B: you know and and then maybe they'd be able to cut back on the other things a little bit more and and give and be able to give those welfare programs to people who really do need them that can't get jobs at all 

354.88 355.70 A: yeah 

364.02 377.60 A: there'd have to be some monitoring system though 'cause there's companies out there that would would be running things like a sweat shop [laughter] you know giving them their their decent rate um the employees a decent rate but still not giving 'em you know the 

373.45 374.74 B: (( right right )) 

377.50 382.03 A: the best treatment benefits all of that stuff you know they they may very well 

380.22 381.28 B: (( exactly )) 

382.41 392.16 A: um find a way to monopolize that like foster parents a lot of foster parents are are you know i mean there are some that are are great and and work for the people and the children 

392.10 393.02 B: uh-huh 

392.24 398.94 A: there's foster parents out there that just do it for the money so companies might get into that situation and just do it for the money 

398.87 400.11 B: right 

400.84 409.33 A: i know they might sh- they cook their books and say they've got more people and they don't and i don't know i mean big companies tend to have the big time lawyers and i just 

410.16 411.30 B: (( yeah i think )) 

410.18 412.13 A: don't know what the answer is 

411.90 416.47 B: right i don't know if there really is an answer i don't know i know that um 

416.83 426.15 B: they were talking about in santa monica um recently raising the ah minimum wage even higher than the six twenty five 

426.22 431.69 B: and there was a lot of problems going on with that because the companies are like we can't afford 

431.93 437.27 B: to pay people if we have to raise our wages we're going to have to be cutting you know cutting jobs because we can't afford that 

438.33 441.44 B: so i don't know if there really is you know an answer 

438.62 439.64 A: yeah 

441.29 443.94 A: i know and i feel bad for the the companies under those 

444.33 445.86 A: conditions um 

446.34 450.92 A: but then again like my my fiance and his father have a a landscape business 

450.80 451.93 B: mhm 

451.33 455.05 A: and they wouldn't dream of paying anybody five fifteen an hour 

455.00 456.35 B: right 

455.18 460.15 A: you know they pay well over that and they certainly aren't rich and the business is new and it's not 

460.43 462.67 A: you know that well established yet 

462.79 465.75 A: and they still pay a minimum of ten dollars 

463.31 470.60 B: and but that's what you have to do if if you have to if you have to just not hire as many people you know maybe that's what you need to do from the beginning 

470.63 475.78 B: you know is just just ah like i want to provide this kind of a quality for my employee and and 

471.00 473.38 A: well then there's the mandatory overtime 

475.32 483.43 A: well yeah you've got to work a few extra hours yourself i mean they're not they're not paying they pay the minimum they'll pay for a laborer is eight dollars an hour 

483.84 487.98 A: so they're almost three dollars an hour above 

488.29 493.04 A: what you know what the state law says they have to the federal law says they have to be 

492.88 493.77 B: oh 

493.37 497.89 A: and new york state doesn't go anything over the federal they never pay anything more [laughter] it's 

497.51 499.72 B: anything more than what's required 

499.21 504.52 A: exactly that's just new york new york's the state that takes it it really they don't care 

499.92 501.35 B: [laughter] 

503.27 504.42 B: yeah 

504.91 506.14 B: i don't know i 

504.99 505.97 A: (( new york [noise] )) 

506.26 509.03 B: that's too bad because you know that i mean 

509.23 514.18 B: new york's probably i don't i don't know a lot about the east coast and i'm sure that new york has a pretty high 

514.35 520.75 B: ah cost of living as well especially with you know around like around the ci- around the city and everything i mean 

519.44 522.37 A: new york city yes ah yeah 

521.06 526.74 B: i'm sure up up north up further north like where it's a little more rural or or not quite as 

526.55 530.76 A: yeah but we got a high tax base because we have to pay for the people down in the city 

530.76 532.14 B: oh really 

531.89 535.89 A: yeah the economy taxes might not be as high 

532.61 533.54 B: (( but then )) 

535.97 547.20 A: um as new york city um county taxes but we still a- a- as far as state taxes yeah we have to compensate for for that huge city 

537.88 539.21 B: but your state 

547.42 548.45 B: right 

547.56 548.39 A: so 

548.60 559.78 A: that's kind of split up and the counties are a little bit different here and there and i'm sure new york city is higher but we are probably higher than most states that you know with rural ar- rural areas 

559.86 560.64 B: mhm 

561.31 562.26 B: mhm 

561.61 567.80 A: and yet and yet we don't have you know our state doesn't go that extra mile and say six twenty five 

568.13 571.65 A: like california does for a minimum wage and and we 

568.19 569.36 B: right 

572.02 578.04 A: and believe me i just i can't imagine anybody living on it here in the rural areas either 

576.03 576.79 B: i 

577.98 591.29 B: i i c- i can't i can't imagine no matter where you are even if you're like in i don't know i think i remember hearing that arkansas had the lowest like you know cost of living i can't even imagine living off that that you know there 

590.68 592.93 A: yeah exactly um 

591.76 595.18 B: just that's just that's just really not leaving us no money 

595.88 599.89 A: no and and you figure i mean an average apart-
