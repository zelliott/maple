8.15 11.48 A: um what do you think about the minimum wage 

12.41 16.38 B: i think five fifteen [laughter] is rather um [laughter] 

16.59 22.02 B: insufficient is a good word i'd i'd it's not a living wage nobody nobody can live off that [noise] 

17.75 18.62 A: yeah 

21.53 23.93 A: right that's exactly how i feel 

24.22 30.17 A: [noise] um i feel it should i mean it should be i would think at least you know seven dollars an hour 

30.32 31.61 A: anyways 

31.33 35.85 B: yeah realistically i mean and it also depends on the part of the country you're in 

35.76 36.79 A: (( right [noise] [mn] )) 

35.91 47.54 B: [mn] i know where i live in michigan the cost of living is rather high whereas a friend who lives in georgia who play pays half the price for gas and milk [mn] we were comparing just the other day but um 

47.60 53.24 B: realistically minimum of seven dollars an hour across the country [mn] and that you know 

51.53 52.60 A: right 

53.52 58.03 B: that's still a tough one to raise a family on you know there's a lot of [mn] single mothers out there 

57.58 62.81 A: yeah the- yeah there is and it is it's not i want to live on you know we live um 

62.91 67.31 A: in a very rural community and [mn] we're up here in maine [laughter] [mn] 

64.71 65.74 B: mhm 

66.84 68.20 B: oh okay [laughter] 

67.32 68.38 A: and you know 

68.22 81.87 A: um like where we live the cost of living's you know pretty reasonable but where we moved from about five hours down state in the southern part of the state it's just it's so outrageous to live there you know the cost of living is 

76.89 77.95 B: mhm 

81.70 83.31 A: you know ridiculous 

82.90 89.50 B: oh yeah and myself i'm working i have a husband who has a good job [mn] but i also have a child 

89.63 94.11 B: and i was looking at the risk of him being shipped out [noise] um 

94.13 103.71 B: because he's a reservist in the military and i'm sitting there going okay [laughter] i'm a stay at home mom with [mn] minimal skills at this point [noise] 

95.96 96.94 A: (( mhm right [mn] )) 

103.85 108.74 B: how am i going to support my daughter when we take a fifty percent decrease in pay 

108.62 109.63 A: right 

109.12 114.52 B: you know there was no way and i with what minimum wage was i couldn't even afford day care 

114.82 128.78 A: well that that's what you find because you know i'm a stay at home mom and um i have three boys [noise] at home [mn] and um you know to go out and go to work it wouldn't even cover my day care cost for my children at minimum wage you know 

126.24 127.44 B: exactly 

127.97 132.63 B: it's cheaper to stay home [laughter] when you have children anymore and [mn] 

129.34 130.16 A: [laughter] 

131.69 133.93 A: [noise] [mn] oh yeah and i have 

132.96 137.85 B: the problem is there's a lot of families can't do that i i'm lucky and i know i'm lucky 

135.31 136.46 A: (( right [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

138.63 142.31 B: you know that's what concerns me is i look at you know 

142.42 147.95 B: [laughter] men work out every day of the week and and women with children earn more that 

148.01 151.63 B: child support isn't [mn] paid ninety percent of the time from what i see you 

151.30 153.03 A: right exactly [noise] [noise] [noise] 

152.42 154.45 B: know how do they support their children 

154.77 161.52 B: and i i gue- that's my biggest concern is you know how how are we feeding our children and most of these jobs do not offer medical to top it off 

161.48 169.33 A: yeah and and that's hard [noise] you know um you know [noise] when you can't i mean on mini- minimum wage who can afford medical you know 

169.64 178.10 A: i mean the a lot of the kids you're going to find go without medical attention when the parents are working at the minimum wage [noise] level because they can't afford to pay for the insurance 

177.47 178.64 B: exactly 

178.17 188.65 A: and in most states [noise] working in minimum wage jobs [noise] you know puts you over the income limi- limit for any kind of public assistance for medical also [noise] [noise] 

188.05 191.98 B: exactly exactly i mean it's it's a catch twenty two 

192.49 196.05 B: [noise] you know it where the minimum wage is at this point 

196.52 200.29 B: puts more people on welfare than it doesn't because they can't afford to go get a job 

200.09 201.59 A: [noise] right exactly [noise] 

200.41 204.18 B: by the time they're done with the medical and childcare 

204.88 206.87 B: they're not making their bills 

207.07 208.64 B: so it's 

208.92 212.75 B: in my opi- i mean [mn] five fifteen might be good when you're sixteen 

212.47 213.40 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

213.29 214.49 B: but not 

214.54 216.70 B: not not when you're trying to pay bills [mn] mhm 

216.13 230.82 A: right exactly i mean [mn] you know i'm thirty five and i have three children at home and you know for me to go out and feasibly get a job and pay for um i we have a seven year old who's disabled and has to have speech and occupational therapy and that 

230.78 237.26 A: and for us to have to pay for that you know upfront i would have to get a job that paid a minimum of like twelve dollars an hour 

236.94 238.24 B: oh yeah 

237.52 241.60 A: just to cover you know the medical expenses and everything [noise] 

241.21 246.12 B: exactly and at at that point you'd still be lucky because by the time they're done taking taxes out [laughter] 

245.94 247.17 A: right 

246.53 252.15 B: you know you're still not making but maybe [mn] you know they they take about a good third of it out [mn] 

252.51 253.93 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

252.51 258.92 B: you know and it's impossible it's impossible i don't see how they consider that a living wage 

259.29 266.17 A: [mn] i don't yeah i don't understand it you know they should have something like that for a student wage maybe but not for a minimum wage you know 

259.40 260.32 B: (( you know )) 

266.23 278.69 A: and um i know wi- you know with me 'cause i've been out of the workforce for a number of years now [mn] um you know i mean that would be the only job you know that i would be able to get would have to be minimum wage job 

278.42 280.39 B: mhm mhm exactly 

278.93 282.23 A: you know 'cause my skills aren't up to par [noise] what they need to be 

282.22 283.09 B: right 

282.77 283.85 A: you know and [noise] 

283.89 285.75 A: and it is and i think 

286.05 290.05 A: [noise] whoever's setting these rules and these laws need to really change them 

290.19 291.93 B: [mn] oh yeah i mean 

292.18 295.15 B: the thing is is five fifteen an hour [mn] 

296.01 298.92 B: ten years ago it was five fifteen an hour 

298.56 299.62 A: (( right [mn] )) 

299.25 303.78 B: you know people who get minimum wage don't even get a cost of living increase 

303.91 306.06 B: and [mn] you know 

304.43 305.45 A: yeah 

306.33 315.56 B: our economy has inflated so dramatically in ten years shoot just in the past two years it's gone sky high you know i [mn] 

315.51 323.71 B: i was paying ninety nine cents a gallon for gas before nine eleven i haven't seen it below a dollar thirty since and right now it's averaging about a dollar seventy five 

323.31 324.55 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] right )) 

323.97 324.84 B: so 

324.89 327.39 B: to get to work you've gotta have the gas 

326.83 329.90 A: right and it is and you know it's 

330.30 343.01 A: it just i i think all these [mn] the expectations you know are way too low um and i know like where we live um you know there's not a lot of high paying jobs there just isn't you know and um 

340.46 341.36 B: mhm 

343.04 347.67 A: the minimum wage jobs are what you're gonna find mostly we just have it's a farming community 

347.29 350.87 B: right that's that's the kind of area we live in right now [noise] 

350.22 363.97 A: [noise] yeah and you know um and even with that you know it's i mean [mn] you know we're pretty lucky 'cause the cost of living and stuff it allows me to stay home with the kids i don't know what i would do if i had to live in a city or even where we lived down state 

364.15 372.13 A: you know where you know we were having to pay rent you know outrageous amounts of rent you know and the groceries were like double 

372.32 373.13 A: you know 

372.40 373.51 B: oh yeah 

373.21 376.65 A: and we're talking like within three hundred about three hundred miles 

376.03 384.96 B: yeah see now i actually have to drive to the bigger cities to get [noise] my groceries [laughter] a little bit cheaper because we have exactly two grocery stores in [mn] between three towns 

379.82 380.88 A: right 

384.78 385.74 A: yeah 

384.97 393.35 B: and so that they don't buy in bulk like like the larger stores do so i actually do have to drive out to the larger stores 

392.54 400.00 A: right well we live in like we're like we don't have a post office or nothing here so we have to drive to town but it's like six or seven miles to town 

396.94 398.04 B: mhm 

399.85 400.86 B: wow [noise] 

400.22 406.74 A: you know and we have um like shop and save i don't know if you have that there or not but we have a shop and save 

403.90 404.96 B: mhm 

405.13 408.52 B: [noise] [noise] i i know what it is i'm familiar with it [mn] [noise] 

407.20 414.99 A: you know we have one of those and like i. j. you know stuff like that so and and they keep the cost really low because they know in the community you know 

414.79 416.75 B: the community can't afford it 

416.09 422.78 A: [noise] right and i just i mean i consider myself pretty lucky you know i have some friends who are really struggling 

422.73 432.09 B: [noise] [noise] [mn] oh yeah oh yeah i mean that's just [mn] i know my my husband is by trade a carpenter and nobody's building things right now 

422.87 423.79 A: (( you know mhm [noise] [mn] )) 

432.22 436.74 B: and so we live day to day goi- hoping that he has a job the next day [noise] 

436.11 437.19 A: yeah 

437.13 439.61 B: (( and [mn] you know [mn] )) 

439.69 443.80 B: that goes right along with everything else is it's just very difficult 

443.96 447.38 B: [mn] like i said i i consider myself highly lucky 

446.89 447.92 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

447.61 455.40 B: but i know here even the mcdonalds cannot get people to work for them for five fifteen an hour they're they're offering seven and eight dollars an hour 

454.97 456.68 A: [noise] yeah [mn] but the- 

455.77 458.86 B: oh and fast food restaurants are [laughter] offering that [mn] 

457.37 458.09 A: right 

458.42 465.31 A: and and you know and that's what we get up here you know um and that's what you find 'em you know offering because 

465.49 474.36 A: you know it's just it's not there um you know it's uh most of the people the people that need it you know it's not worth it for them 

474.64 485.65 A: you know and i mean i understand the past two years they want people to go they want people work and they want all this welfare and reform and stuff which is is fine and great but you gotta give people enough to live on 

485.32 489.72 B: [noise] yeah you you [noise] have to make it possible for them to get off the welfare [noise] mhm [noise] 

489.06 502.92 A: [mn] you know you can't just take say well you know you're working minimum wage you're making you know a hundred and thirty a week or whatever and everything else is gone well [mn] jeeze you know about a hundred and thirty a week my child needs a pair of glasses or whatever 

502.66 515.67 B: yeah and if you priced eyeglasses 'cause i just did [laughter] they're e- e- even i have good medical insurance and even with medical insurance they still cost me a hundred dollars out of my pocket and we don't even want to talk about dental insurance 'cause [mn] 

505.10 506.19 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

509.54 510.40 A: right 

512.27 513.51 A: yeah 

516.62 524.78 B: i don't know too many people who have a whole lot of coverage of dental which is probably why half of america has bad teeth [mn] but you can't afford these things 

521.79 522.69 A: right 

524.26 529.82 A: no it they're like luxuries you know and they shouldn't be because it's you know important to your health you know [mn] 

529.08 530.31 B: exactly 

529.66 544.21 A: i mean you know um our son who is disabled he wears glasses and his glasses um if we had to pay out of pocket the full expense it would be almo- almost five hundred dollars because he's almost le- he's considered legally blind 

540.02 541.16 B: right 

543.59 551.43 B: right you know and that's the problem is a lot of the children [mn] are being lost in this 

544.31 545.41 A: (( so [sigh] [mn] yeah [mn] right )) 

551.57 552.66 A: (( [mn] yeah )) 

551.78 555.36 B: because of you know they think that five fifteen well i know 

555.61 563.51 B: [sigh] five fifteen [mn] would not the full months pay even if i had to pay nothing else would not cover my house payment 

563.71 565.29 B: not after taxes 

564.91 565.94 A: yeah 

565.32 572.02 B: but even my hou- and i don't have a real expense house payment compared to most who live in my area [mn] my house payment is fairly low [noise] 

571.76 572.83 A: yeah 

573.15 581.34 A: and that's you know and that's where we're lucky too 'cause we don't have a big mortgage you know and our mortgage is cheaper than we were paying for rent i mean 

579.87 582.13 B: mhm oh yes [laughter] 

581.47 583.07 A: we're we're paying 

583.14 584.40 A: almost 

584.72 590.64 A: we're paying less than half you know for our mortgage than we were for paying rent 

590.36 599.89 B: right right well we [mn] well that's us i mean we got a good deal on our house we got it for fifty two thousand dollars which gave me a really good plus we got a really really good rate 

590.89 591.94 A: you know and 

599.27 599.89 A: (( [mn] great ))
