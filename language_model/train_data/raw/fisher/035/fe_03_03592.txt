1.07 4.15 B: hi there my name is alison and i'm in california 

3.80 6.72 A: hi i'm kathy in pennsylvania 

6.64 11.20 B: mm how do you feel about five dollars and fifteen cents an hour in pennsylvania 

11.33 14.69 A: well i really don't think that that's 

14.75 21.20 A: actually a high enough rate um our the cost of living rates are much higher 

21.27 22.71 B: i agree [laughter] 

22.57 26.95 A: how about in califor- oh california i'm sure you're much higher huh 

26.39 34.10 B: yeah five dollars and fifteen cents an hour let's see the average forty hour work week throughout a year would be two thousand and eighty hours 

34.27 37.19 B: times five point one five 

37.22 41.51 B: that's only ten thousand seven hundred and twelve dollars and that's before taxes 

41.43 43.67 A: i know i don't 

42.50 45.12 B: i don't know anybody who could live on that 

44.53 47.58 A: no i don't either especially families 

47.23 48.36 B: (( yeah mm )) 

48.47 50.69 A: i i could see 

50.81 53.80 A: i i feel it should be at least 

54.53 58.16 A: two dollars more seven fifteen minimum wage 

58.68 72.93 B: i wonder if there's ever a system that they could come up with where it was a graduated minimum wage so perhaps if you were you know a high school student just working a part time job obviously you wouldn't need to earn as much money 'cause you don't have a family to support 

73.32 74.23 B: so 

74.63 79.01 B: making just spending money might be acceptable at five dollars and fifteen cents an hour 

78.69 79.59 A: right 

79.64 80.83 B: but then a 

81.25 84.80 B: who knows how they would police that [laughter] 

83.86 96.33 A: [laughter] i i know ah well i think too that when they would sign up for their their income tax as to how many dependents they have and if it's m- multiple you know other than yourself 

91.98 93.10 B: mhm 

96.31 99.08 A: that you fall into another rate 

98.86 99.99 B: yeah 

99.41 103.52 A: and use a slide scale which would be really nice 

103.30 108.75 B: well we definitely need minimum wage workers because businesses can only afford so much and 

108.89 111.68 B: a lot of jobs out there don't really require 

112.12 115.03 B: a lot of knowledge where you would really 

115.07 117.09 B: have a skill set that would 

118.15 119.76 B: emphasize the 

119.89 124.58 B: you know need is probably not the right word but ah the reason to earn more money 

124.22 134.11 A: right and look at people in retirement where they can only earn so much and finding ah a job at minimum wage would be beneficial for them 

129.01 130.29 B: mhm 

133.79 135.03 B: exactly 

134.86 144.17 A: ah or a i have a a son who's ah still at high school and minimum wage is great spending money for him 

143.76 145.27 B: mhm 

144.91 146.07 A: um 

146.15 149.78 A: yeah if if they just had a way that they could ah 

150.45 155.74 A: clarify in in increases into the wage earnings 

155.13 156.33 B: yeah 

156.31 157.72 A: that would be nice 

158.24 165.36 B: well i'm actually surprised to see that it's up to five dollars and fifteen cents i think back when i first started working minimum wage was around two dollars 

165.18 168.12 A: oh i know i know same here i 

166.00 167.06 B: [laughter] 

167.97 169.07 B: [laughter] 

168.32 171.40 A: [laughter] and i and i look at ah 

171.49 175.32 A: about seven years' ago i was hired to work as 

175.53 177.33 A: an aid at a school 

177.42 182.01 A: and i was hired at minimum wage and when i look at what i did 

182.84 184.74 A: i should have been paid double 

184.47 185.12 B: (( mm )) 

184.91 190.88 A: [laughter] and i think of people like that that a lot of times don't come in at minimum wage and 

191.10 195.85 A: the amount of work that you're expected to do is just unthought of 

195.63 196.81 B: yeah 

197.46 204.06 A: i wish there was a way they could control that better but i'm gl- glad they do have minimum wage 

200.95 201.82 B: (( oh the )) 

204.70 207.34 A: where people could make in a lot less 

206.71 207.86 B: yeah 

208.17 214.69 B: although with the unemployment rate the way it is out here in silicon valley right now i suppose we should be happy to be getting any money at all 

214.24 215.90 A: right right 

215.58 220.18 B: but ah ten thousand dollars a year is just unbelievably low 

219.83 226.19 A: well i don't see how anyone could survive on that especially like we said with with families or 

226.72 230.77 A: even single head of household i [laughter] i don't see how they could do it 

230.21 231.22 B: (( yeah it's )) 

231.31 233.18 A: i really don't 

232.88 234.85 B: less than a thousand dollars a month 

234.55 235.48 A: yes 

235.96 236.78 A: yes 

237.04 242.36 A: i guess that you would just take care of the essentials and no life [laughter] 

241.77 245.10 B: yeah [laughter] 

243.11 245.94 A: [laughter] oh i know 

245.90 246.83 B: yeah 

248.41 250.91 A: well i don't know it's a 

252.21 257.24 A: what a topic i'm glad that i'm i'm glad i heard it was five fifteen an hour because i 

257.87 261.62 A: just didn't remember what the the minimum wage was 

261.10 263.97 B: yeah i honestly wouldn't have had any idea 

263.69 274.96 A: i know i know but um like i said i know with my son he thinks it's pretty good but he also thinks that he could be making more as well [laughter] 

275.00 282.22 B: i know here in california that a lot of jobs do pay more than minimum wage just because it is hard to find employees 

282.59 292.17 B: um i don't know how it is out in in pennsylvania do you feel that like most of the fast food and movie theatre jobs and things are paying more than that or 

282.63 283.38 A: right 

292.23 302.39 A: well they'll those type of jobs don't usually start out at the minimum wage and then within thirty days be reviewed and possibly get a twenty thirty cent raise 

302.15 304.02 B: oh still not much 

303.42 313.92 A: right right and then i believe they go either three to six months and then they'll review it again so they do have the possibility of of building that up 

313.95 314.85 A: um 

316.52 318.89 A: i don't know it's just 

321.59 330.63 A: it is an issue it's ah you don't think of it i mean i don't currently work so i'm not affected by it at this time but ah 

329.56 330.72 B: mhm 

330.68 336.13 A: i know should i go out and be able to get a job soon then 

337.76 340.18 A: i look at that and i'm thinking well 

340.24 342.42 A: i'd sure like a lot more [laughter] 

342.27 349.82 B: well and also you'd have to decide is is how worth it is it for you to have to get in your car and drive or to take public transportation 

350.01 354.00 B: i know here in california public transportation's fairly expensive and it's 

354.14 357.66 B: i i'm not positive but i believe it's over three dollars a day now 

357.72 362.33 B: ah to get a day pass to ride the bus or the light rail system and so 

362.37 367.46 B: when you're looking at five fifteen an hour and then every day you have to take that money out 

367.50 368.93 A: exactly 

368.12 375.58 B: and you have to you know have money to eat a lunch or something so you're probably either spending money to buy a lunch or spending money at the grocery store it kind of 

375.81 381.28 B: makes it back to you is it worth it or is it easier just to be on welfare or unemployment 

380.73 383.70 A: right and how about the ah 

383.73 385.38 A: single parents 

385.24 386.20 B: yeah 

385.85 389.22 A: have to put their child into a daycare facility 

389.59 390.79 A: to work 

390.51 394.29 B: almost seems like a vicious circle where they just wouldn't be able to 

394.34 395.50 B: get ahead 

395.37 398.61 A: exactly ex- exactly a- and 

398.80 401.50 A: when you brought up the welfare issue that 

401.99 406.64 A: you know which would which would be better you know if someone had the choice 

408.51 412.36 A: they're going to say well minimum wage isn't that great 

411.79 412.67 B: yeah 

412.73 416.84 A: and you do hear that now and they'll say well i can't go to mcdonalds and work 

416.98 419.39 A: i can't live on that 

420.48 422.07 B: which is true yeah 

420.49 421.20 A: so 

421.74 425.63 A: it would be nice it would be nice if it could be higher [mn] 

427.29 429.05 B: but then if it were higher 

429.15 437.36 B: businesses such as fast food would probably have to raise the prices in order to cover the cost to pay their workers do you think 

437.19 438.44 A: exactly 

437.65 440.60 B: consumers would be willing to fit the bill for that 

440.39 443.69 A: well see there's another thing too that they raise the 

444.68 450.82 A: to pay for their employees and and then people will say well i can't afford to do this 

452.02 457.80 A: so yeah that that is a good point where they would have to increase their pricing 

458.81 460.98 A: on various items like that 

462.89 472.71 A: i know in the the food business say a restaurant though they will start out at minimum wage but then they also rely on their tips 

472.59 478.77 A: and some places some restaurants don't even charge or pay their employees the minimum wage 

479.87 481.92 B: they pay 'em less than that 

481.30 483.96 A: they'll pay them less and 

484.04 489.55 A: they'll they'll need the tips to where the real money comes from 

489.38 490.44 B: wow 

490.23 491.33 A: i know 

491.05 493.16 B: i didn't know that they could pay 'em less 

493.80 501.13 A: yeah well now my my son does work in a restaurant so he is paid minimum wage so i take it that that could have changed 

501.61 507.51 A: but i know that restaurants used to not be held 

508.71 513.29 A: responsible or have to charge the minimum wage 

513.23 514.14 B: wow 

514.49 520.41 B: and i know that here in california as far as the tips go that employees now are um 

520.55 524.85 B: for most restaurants it's computerized so they have to key in how much of a tip they got 

524.91 530.65 B: and and they have to pay taxes at a certain rate on it so they can't hide any of that income any longer so 

531.12 535.00 B: if if people aren't giving them very good tips then 

531.22 532.02 A: oh 

535.69 538.75 B: they're not making much money at all by the time they pay taxes 

538.63 544.95 A: no not at all that's interesting we don't have that out here yet but ah i'm sure it's coming 

544.64 546.13 B: [laughter] 

545.19 550.02 A: [laughter] well in a lot of restaurants they will tell you that you 

550.04 556.47 A: ah they'll post write on their menus that you do need to tip at least fifteen percent 

556.36 557.38 B: wow 

557.51 561.49 A: so i you know i guess some of them are covering that 

562.25 568.26 A: but i don't know it's it's hard to tell someone you have to tip this much 

568.09 571.44 B: but what if they don't do it i mean how do they enforce that 

570.99 583.48 A: well that's it i don't know it most places if it is a a nice restaurant ah the people would probably be using a credit card they probably automatically just 

583.78 589.82 A: i and i've been some place too where they just automatically add it to your bill 

590.28 591.98 A: this is what you owe 

590.31 591.32 B: wow 

593.14 595.26 A: gratuity is included 

595.54 599.25 B: i don't think i'd be very happy with that [laughter] 

597.13 598.66 A: no no 

598.90 599.89 A: no so i
