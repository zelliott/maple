10.15 15.85 B: fif- oh i guess here i live in california i think minimum wage is more than that already 

14.77 20.85 A: it is yeah it actually is about i think that they were trying to pass it to be seven dollars an hour 

21.28 27.19 B: i don't know how anybody could live on five something or even seven something anywhere but 

23.22 24.40 A: (( yeah the )) 

26.56 31.95 A: yeah there isn't so are you are you do you work for the research group or are you just another person calling like me 

31.60 33.39 B: i'm just another person calling [laughter] 

33.22 36.25 A: okay yeah i was just curious i didn't know yeah i i don't think um 

36.83 40.05 A: i don't think that that's enough because that doesn't 

38.87 39.97 B: yeah i don't 

40.05 40.95 B: (( i'm sorry )) 

40.09 43.34 A: that doesn't i think twelve dollars an hour here

43.51 45.24 B: are you in california too 

44.54 46.47 A: i yeah i'm in san francisco 

45.87 47.86 B: (( oh oh yeah me too [laughter] )) 

47.68 50.66 A: yeah 'cause i'm thinking that thirteen dollars an hour 

47.92 48.48 B: (( [noise] )) 

51.75 55.71 A: only equates to about twenty five thousand dollars a year 

55.71 58.44 B: (( [noise] yeah i mean i don't know how anybody could live on )) 

57.42 59.77 A: and and and you can't live on that either here 

59.88 63.63 B: yeah that's for sure [noise] and imagine if you had kids too you know 

63.37 66.29 A: yeah there's no way if you had kids there's no way 

66.79 68.26 A: um i think that 

68.95 71.47 A: [mn] honestly i think the minimum wage for 

71.97 75.66 A: for like the san francisco bay area if there was such a thing would be 

76.44 78.56 A: about 

79.50 80.85 A: i mean livable 

80.80 82.15 B: yeah [laughter] 

81.64 85.25 A: livable would be you know fourteen dollars an hour honestly 

85.11 86.89 B: i think so too i mean 

87.69 90.40 B: but yeah [laughter] yeah that's it's kind of 

90.56 93.37 B: kinda crazy but then you have people that have really 

93.64 95.66 B: low skills but i mean 

95.79 99.14 B: but still they would need to people need to eat i guess [laughter] 

98.64 108.88 A: right i mean to be to be able to live at least in a in the bay area where we li- we live i mean i guess in other cal- parts of california you know there's such things as five hundred dollar 

109.84 114.41 A: a month rooms or or or or apartments but i don't think that i mean 

109.87 112.09 B: yeah that's true yeah 

114.46 117.60 A: here you're starting at like at least twelve hundred dollars 

117.49 120.64 B: that's true yeah that's yeah [lipsmack] 

120.65 123.77 B: yeah so i think they should definitely raise it um 

124.54 129.29 A: yeah definitely i think they should raise yeah i think they should raise it a couple at least a few dollars 

125.35 126.57 B: quite a bit [laughter] 

129.35 137.19 A: um because then that would push the standard for i mean right now they're getting like development directors [laughter] for like fifteen dollars an hour [sigh] 

136.69 140.74 B: that's so sad i remember when i first moved up here [laughter] 

140.89 151.31 B: my daughter's walking around with the telephone talking going me too me too [laughter] um [laughter] when i first moved up here everybody was like so overpaid 

144.41 146.21 A: [laughter] 

151.25 152.96 A: it's true yeah 

152.17 166.22 B: and now like you said like i look on craig's list i i'm an at home mom so i don't really i'm not like looking for work but i just kinda look to see what's out there and i mean jobs that used to pay like sixty grand are you know thirteen dollars an hour now 

163.99 164.72 A: pay 

165.75 169.18 A: yeah they're paying thirteen dollars an hour it's very true they're pay- that's 

169.25 181.99 A: and i was talking to my father about it and he said you know for every thirty thousand dollar job out there right now there's a hundred and fifty phds willing to fill it [sigh] so it's kind of it's bad because i i used to people used to fight for me um 

176.44 177.30 B: yeah 

182.35 184.90 A: in uh you know positions 

184.46 185.65 B: mhm 

185.12 190.57 A: and i'd actually turn them down and now i feel like a mor- [laughter] a moron for doing so [mn] 

189.61 194.57 B: that's what i was telling my husband when i moved up here on a whim pretty much 

194.58 200.02 B: um i came up here with like tons of job offers you know and i was like wow this is 

200.19 212.40 B: pretty nice and you know and i like i told him 'cause we were discussing if i were gonna go back to work and stuff and i just said you know what [noise] luckily all everyone that i knew they were all in like the dotcom field 

211.85 212.83 A: right 

212.21 220.57 B: and unfortunately they were all laid off and all of his friends they're all in biotech and he's in biotech and none of them have been laid off like during this whole 

220.31 221.87 A: that's true that's 

220.95 225.34 B: thing and he doesn't know what it's really like you know for everyone else 

225.52 234.90 A: yeah that's very true my my actually my fiance is a a doctor and obviously healthcare and biotechnology are the two that are not gonna go but in for everything else 

235.22 236.90 B: yeah and he's like well 

237.06 241.07 B: and i'm like no you don't understand you know i mean 'cause daycare is like 

240.98 253.21 B: at least for like [noise] super cheap is a thousand something dollars and you know if you were only gonna make you know with what the wages are now like it what's the point you know that added to worrying about your kid you know 

251.09 251.94 A: that 

252.90 260.28 A: i honestly believe if people are gonna be offered only let's say if people who are looking for work and they're gonna go back for work for about seven or eight dollars an hour 

260.33 261.53 A: they're only 

261.67 266.89 A: it it won't make sense for them to go back to work it would make more sense for them to [laughter] collect unemployment 

266.30 270.35 B: i know i i think so too i mean [noise] 

267.47 268.41 A: [laughter] 

270.34 273.16 A: or at least or at least use their unemployment 

270.36 271.42 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

273.18 274.92 A: until it's up 

274.94 279.14 A: and then you know look for for work that pays more so that they can you know 

279.98 291.46 B: i know yeah i i [sigh] i mean i don't know how people do it you know just i mean when you're single i guess you can kinda scrimp and you know that kind of thing but when you have kids and or you're married and that 

290.85 293.79 A: or you're married yeah it's much more [laughter] expensive 

294.83 297.45 A: yeah i mean i live with my i live with my um 

297.51 298.51 A: with my fi- 

298.56 303.90 A: with my fiance and there's no way i could actually live on an unemployment check there's no way 

303.59 305.59 B: [noise] i know i know it's 

305.00 314.11 A: and it mine my unemployment would be about twelve hundred dollars per month or three hundred dollars a week which is much more than a seven dollar minimum wage job would provide 

313.84 325.47 B: [lipsmack] i know yeah i got um unemployment for a little bit too and and it was the same thing it was nice i mean 'cause i at the time i really didn't need a job [laughter] so it was just kinda like extra money 

324.75 328.85 A: yeah i haven't ever thought about it but this time i'm thin- i'm thinking about it so 

328.86 332.14 A: i haven't gotten it yet so but it's 

331.48 338.88 B: well i mean not i'm not usually like a taker but you know it was kinda like well you know i had my daughter and um 

334.79 335.76 A: yeah 

338.29 349.32 A: oh no yeah no no my all my fr- all my friends are on it i mean all my friends or have been on it they were you know they were phds from stanford they went to oxford university they weren't 

339.05 341.25 B: and i was like well you know [laughter] [noise] 

349.39 362.72 A: you know i mean they just weren't these were people who are like you know educated very edu- you know at at the top schools and and they're living at home now [laughter] uh yeah oh yeah some of them have moved back home or they're yeah they've [sigh] 

352.59 353.27 B: (( mm )) 

353.36 354.74 B: right totally 

357.40 358.61 B: really 

362.19 364.77 B: we were talking about that that's really interesting 

364.81 367.22 A: yeah so i mean minimum wage 

367.59 371.10 A: i mean i think it just like it goes with the economy they need to 

371.07 371.68 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

371.64 375.33 A: i mean for the people who are actually actually do work they do need [laughter] to pay them 

375.29 376.52 B: [noise] i know 

375.49 377.65 A: a cer- have a certain standard 

377.44 382.08 B: and no matter how um bad the economy is like you know your bills 

379.35 379.91 A: (( [mn] )) 

382.12 387.80 B: they still wanna be paid they they're not gonna say oh well well i know lots of people are laid off [laughter] [noise] 

387.39 388.39 A: right 

389.08 399.77 A: right but i think i think for other states five fifteen they have to make at least that i mean they have to m- i think that i think that in all states they should at least make seven dollars an an hour and here they should at least make nine 

389.37 390.50 B: (( so yeah )) 

399.84 402.65 A: i mean at the very bare minimum i'm talking about 

401.71 403.54 B: i agree yeah [noise] 

402.97 410.80 A: working the like bare minimum but that not that that's a livable wage i think that livable's more like thirteen or four- [mn] i mean thirteen or fourteen 

410.99 413.37 B: [noise] yeah it's funny sometimes when i um [noise] 

412.72 415.67 A: if you're living by yourself that's for a single person 

417.06 417.99 A: (( [sigh] so )) 

417.74 426.88 B: yeah sometimes i encounter people that um you know make actually somebody just told me they made seven fifty and i was thinking oh my god you know i 

427.00 431.51 B: think i made that in high school and and it wasn't a lot in high school [laughter] 

430.79 438.86 A: it wasn't a lot in high school exactly no i that's that's true i think the [sigh] the lowest i've ever been paid was about i think i had an eight dollar an hour job 

438.98 441.09 A: it was at a 

439.08 439.92 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

441.20 445.45 A: uh it it was at a very high profile restaurant in san francisco when i was a teenager 

445.47 451.15 A: and i was the hostess there and it was eight dollars plus tips so i was bringing home like a hundred dollars in tips each night 

451.35 458.87 A: so it wasn't the actual it was just like being a wait- you know a waitress you don't rely on your salary you re- rely on your 

456.00 456.83 B: right 

459.20 460.94 A: on your tips so 

460.45 461.11 B: (( [noise] )) 

461.52 466.19 A: so that was like you know the lowest i think i've gone [laughter] 

464.99 470.16 B: yeah i mean so imagine like having to take some crappy job now you know 

470.18 471.18 A: yeah that 

470.25 471.88 B: (( like just to survive [noise] )) 

471.31 474.56 A: and that's what and that's what's offered right now and i think that's why 

474.88 477.46 A: there do need to be new standards because there 

477.54 478.10 A: (( [mn] )) 

478.16 483.99 A: there there's nothing there's nothing really out there and if you're getting [sigh] you know a million over qualified people 

485.43 487.98 A: you know applying for retail sales jobs 

487.70 494.99 B: yeah [laughter] it's so funny i saw someone at my starbucks you know my local starbucks that used to work with me

504.20 507.52 B: it really is i mean that's just [noise] kinda how i see it 

507.69 514.37 A: yeah i mean i mean it's kind and and i was thinking i mean i was talking about it and i was like i was you know saying hey you know this is kinda 

514.61 516.88 A: this is kinda where the economy is going 

517.06 521.30 A: and i actually was talking to some people who work for another industry tolleys 

517.39 518.01 B: (( [laughter] )) 

521.46 523.38 A: you know it's another coffee chain

525.07 525.97 A: yeah 

526.06 527.05 A: and uh 

527.63 532.04 A: 'cause they were up the street from where i work and they are all laid off dotcom people 

532.24 536.69 A: and actually i just interviewed for a position as a manager at swatch 

536.58 537.56 B: oh cool 

537.25 543.11 A: yeah w- which is like something i would have never thought of doing in my entire life 

542.68 544.43 B: [noise] 

543.53 547.51 A: ever and i think i'm being offered the position but it's 

547.87 550.56 A: um i mean if you can imagine 

550.71 553.61 B: yeah yeah retail but you know 

553.52 557.81 A: i mean it's it's managing two of them at the airport but at the same time i mean 

557.94 563.51 A: i probably can't live on forty thousand dollars a year or i don't know what they're offering for it yet i haven't discussed salary [mn] 

562.87 567.51 B: well maybe when you you know i mean not like you should live off your husband but you know but 

567.01 575.67 A: yeah i mean well that's yeah that but that's also the thing that i don't wanna put pressure on since we're not married yet [laughter] so it's kind of like you know 

575.58 588.44 B: i'm sure he would rather see you you know i mean if you can find a job where you are doing what you wanna do and you're making forty thousand dollars i would say you know do it but if it's something if you don't like it and it's forty then that would suck 

586.58 592.45 A: right no he's he's he's he wants yeah that's that's exactly what he said he wants me to do something that i enjoy at the same time 

592.96 593.95 A: (( [lipsmack] so )) 

594.80 599.32 B: yeah i mean that's kinda how it is with my husband i mean initially like we would have
