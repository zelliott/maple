394.32 395.80 B: (( [noise] mhm ))

437.95 441.44 B: the big city you know the center of city um 

439.38 440.18 A: (( uh-huh uh-huh )) 

441.51 442.35 B: (( mm )) 

442.67 446.36 B: the sometimes the rent is kind of you know leasing

468.26 469.38 B: (( oh pardon )) 

469.46 470.85 B: [laughter] 

469.58 472.03 A: i said i wonder how we're doing on time

484.57 489.57 A: yeah see i and i'm one of those that have a real strong a real strong feeling on 

489.68 490.63 A: um 

491.79 495.85 A: i think getting it changed is going to would be would be a major hassle 

496.13 497.27 B: (( okay [noise] )) 

496.37 503.16 A: um i i don't know that anybody i don't know that anybody who has the control of that really feels that it's worthwhile 

502.88 503.70 B: right 

503.70 510.81 A: because for one thing the people who are making minimum wage aren't really their constituents so much that you know they're not 

510.91 514.33 A: that pop- the the the people that are young 

514.33 515.34 B: yes 

514.72 524.89 A: or they're in economically depressed areas like inner cities and stuff and they're not the people that get out and vote they're not the people that write to congress men so i don't see 

517.90 518.85 B: right 

521.44 522.45 B: mhm 

523.91 524.89 B: right 

525.54 529.27 A: i don't see it changing any time soon

533.55 534.50 B: uh-huh 

533.96 536.99 A: but 'cause it was at three thirty five for a long time
