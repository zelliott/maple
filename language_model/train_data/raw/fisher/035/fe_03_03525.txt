0.00 1.58 B: hi my name is raquel 

0.99 2.75 A: hi my name is [noise] winnie [noise] 

2.48 15.21 B: hello [mn] um [lipsmack] so regarding the minimum wage [mn] uh i definitely don't feel that's enough i'm not sur- i'm not as familiar with [mn] the minimum wage laws if it's 

15.10 17.67 B: i'm assuming it's different in each state 

17.14 18.22 A: mhm 

17.49 25.23 B: i don't know if if that is the case or not but i'm [mn] uh i live in new york city and you know five dollars um 

25.08 32.74 B: [mn] and or five fifteen whatever it is [mn] an hour is is nothing i mean even ten dollars an hour um can't get you very far let alone 

32.77 37.48 B: half of that um [mn] so i don't know uh 

37.71 44.73 B: if um from your experience or or where you're from how how you feel that would um if that would get very far 

44.32 52.60 A: well uh i live in new york city as well yeah and i totally agree with you especially now we've got the fare increase and everything it's just 

46.35 47.28 B: okay 

52.41 67.06 A: it's just crazy um 'cause i know well right now i live at home with my parents but [mn] i'm still in college and last year i lived in an apartment and just keeping up with rent and everything it's it's just it really isn't enough 

66.91 76.22 A: especially if you want to have a family or whatever but it it's just totally [noise] not enough [mn] [noise] but i don't know i don't know what can we do about that [laughter] actually [mn] [noise] 

68.72 70.09 B: (( right [noise] )) 

74.13 79.82 B: yeah i mean i guess it's it definitely [mn] um i don't know whether that 

79.84 90.36 B: that wage is based on still keeping someone at poverty level because i w- i would imagine like you figure with that five times like forty forty dollars a day 

89.94 91.02 A: yeah 

90.54 102.54 B: um [mn] which is nothing and granted [mn] you know you don't you don't have to live like in the best neighborhood in in new york or whatever um that may be but it it will also i think [noise] 

92.63 93.24 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

96.57 97.58 A: mhm 

102.59 103.96 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

104.09 112.21 B: uh you know keep people in in their place i guess y- you know like it will definitely attract minority workers or people who are [mn] um 

106.67 107.89 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

107.95 108.71 A: yeah 

112.05 124.21 B: don't have as [mn] high a level of education 'cause th- they're gonna be the ones who [mn] um not that they want to take it necessarily but [mn] they'll be sort of the only jobs i think [noise] that they can qualify for or 

121.63 122.62 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

123.51 128.99 A: oh yeah especially immigrants as well if you're just coming in to a new country it's it's gonna be very hard 

126.94 128.10 B: right 

128.83 141.58 A: [mn] i mean i think it's everything factors in because even with um health in a way because people say well you know americans have [mn] bad health but it also goes into your diet and what kind of food you can afford and if you're you know you're not making e- 

139.71 141.96 B: right definitely 

141.39 145.40 A: you know [mn] it just all factors in [mn] so i don't know 

144.70 151.65 B: yeah and then it's also the same thing with the lil- um interesting enough 'cause there's this whole thing about unemployment now 

151.14 152.20 A: mhm 

151.59 162.10 B: and people wanting to get an extension for unemployment benefits but people who ironically enough [mn] probably the people who need it the most like the [mn] um low income workers 

162.02 167.52 B: don't even qualify for unemployment because you have uh i i believe you have to have made like 

167.37 177.33 B: some [mn] some crazy like ten thousand dollars or or some amount like that [mn] to in in like six months there's some kind of i i could be slightly off but [mn] there's some 

171.40 173.12 A: oh i didn't know that [noise] 

177.15 188.54 B: um you know golden number that you have to have made to even qualify for unemployment otherwise [mn] you don't so it's it's interesting because it's it's kinda one of those things like the people who need it the most 

183.71 184.92 A: (( [noise] [noise] mhm )) 

188.57 192.64 B: um won't have access to it because they didn't even earn enough 

192.00 193.28 A: yeah 

192.65 202.20 B: to qualify for unemployment or like someone who's a millionaire of course probably wouldn't need unemployment if anything ever happened [mn] but would be entitled to it [noise] 

198.18 199.30 A: mhm 

202.37 205.99 A: it's really interesting because right now i'm taking um a u. s. history course 

205.86 220.25 A: and it's just like with all the the way the economy's changing is just like the gap between the rich and the poor getting [mn] you know it's it's just becoming even greater wider like the rich are just getting richer and the poor are just getting poorer and it's kinda like the system that we've 

220.09 227.50 A: built right now is just gonna stay that way and it's unfortunate america is supposed to be the land of opportunity and it's 

222.83 224.09 B: right 

226.82 240.42 B: right and then and i guess for probably immigrants [mn] you know the five dollars an hour would go very far where they're at of course i mean there's [mn] you know you've got people uh [mn] around the world who are making like [mn] 

227.72 229.00 A: my husband 

235.50 237.16 A: mhm yeah 

240.46 242.25 B: much less than that 

241.88 242.80 A: mhm 

242.16 255.17 B: um [mn] but of course it [mn] the standard of living is also much lower or probably you don't need as much to go as far um not to say that they're not getting paid [mn] a lot either 'cause they're definitely not 

249.42 250.53 A: that's true 

255.09 257.80 B: um but i guess they uh 

257.84 260.83 B: like you were saying it definitely sort of [mn] um 

261.16 270.66 B: keeps you keeps you in place and it's not anything that um [mn] i think with that low wage it also [mn] comes a certain 

263.07 264.08 A: mhm 

270.72 281.20 B: level o- offer you a certain level of job and then a certain [mn] way of being treated as well um that's just normally associated with that but it's not um 

275.83 277.76 A: yeah yeah 

281.31 284.83 B: [mn] you know in indiana i don't think it's necessarily [mn] [mn] 

284.87 297.71 B: i i mean i suppose it for a certain situation it is okay for a starting point like people who [mn] literally just get off the boat and and again i'm as uh i don't know whether um 

290.62 291.52 A: yeah 

293.11 294.14 A: mhm 

297.70 305.00 B: [lipsmack] how it works even with illegal immigrants if this is if this law would pertain to them since they're illegal 

299.98 301.01 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

304.43 312.49 A: yeah i i mean i i'm guessing they would be abused [noise] 'cause i mean they probably wouldn't think they have any right to demand a higher wage if you know if they're worried about you know 

312.33 324.30 A: um some official coming along [noise] you know so i guess they would probably feel intimidated [mn] but i mean even for me like uh when i um my first job when i was in school so during spring break i went out to get a a job 

314.08 315.73 B: (( [noise] right )) 

324.22 332.98 A: and it's kinda like for me i just wanted anything out there and i didn't have the experience to actually you know lobby for myself to get a higher wage 

333.05 334.54 A: so um 

334.39 339.66 A: i kinda got taken advantage of 'cause i got paid five forty five which granted isn't that far away 

339.24 340.34 B: mhm 

339.51 344.10 A: from minimum wage [mn] so but with the amount of work that i had to do and i guess 

343.94 355.59 A: i i was just intimidated 'cause it's my first job so i didn't wanna like push for a higher wage so i guess a an immigrant would be even you know [noise] even more intimated to [noise] so it's like wow 

353.10 355.06 B: oh sure right 

355.17 366.61 B: right and then like i said i don't even know what what the law is on that let alone [mn] someone who is an immigrant who for obvious reasons probably wouldn't even want to find out because by [mn] calling and asking you're in a way 

355.63 356.19 A: (( [mn] )) 

362.28 363.27 A: yeah 

363.43 364.57 A: mhm 

366.70 376.30 B: you know giving yourself up and and saying who you are and i i guess i suppose there would be a way to call [mn] sort of anonymously um but it's 

368.00 369.40 A: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

373.82 374.81 A: yeah 

376.46 386.18 B: [mn] you know and again i don't i'm not quite sure how they even come up with this ridiculous amount um i mean especially for n- [mn] for new york city 

380.01 381.43 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

381.60 382.78 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

385.52 387.15 A: (( yeah [noise] [noise] )) 

386.09 389.83 B: um i i just don't know w- you know what 

389.62 404.46 B: [mn] i mean if the expectation is okay this is [mn] um the lowest amount because then you could be living with like three other people and [mn] you know under a bridge or you know or where wherever it may be but i don't think it's necessarily based on [mn] it 

397.14 398.18 A: mhm 

398.77 400.50 A: (( yeah you know )) 

404.32 409.67 B: it can't be based on anything all that realistic and it's like all the other um [mn] [lipsmack] 

406.64 407.52 A: no [noise] 

409.82 415.85 B: a lot of other programs uh i think that we have in place [mn] it um 

416.33 426.88 B: it sort of it ra- it's not it's more reactive rather than preventive i guess is what i'm trying to say like um especially after the attacks for instance there's a whole thing with um with f._e._m._a. 

420.39 421.34 A: okay 

426.83 436.47 B: with the federal i think it's federal emergency management agency [mn] and they were helping with their rent only at least initially only people who were 

430.56 431.51 A: mhm 

436.46 445.76 B: um being evicted [mn] and what i'm saying is well i i think now that's changed and of course they're e- expanded that to help people who 

438.26 439.71 A: (( [noise] ooh )) 

445.78 450.06 B: ha- are a- at risk for being uh evicted 

449.52 450.60 A: mhm 

450.02 461.13 B: and which to me makes more sense it's like well why wait until the problem happens you know like why not do something to prevent that from happening in the first place and [mn] it's the same thing i think with um 

451.77 452.80 A: yeah 

453.79 455.14 A: exactly 

461.37 464.93 B: uh i i don't know whether it's because it's uh again 

465.15 472.94 B: government uh mandated but [mn] the the rules seem to be um it's it's not preventive 

472.47 473.65 A: (( [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

472.95 476.60 B: you know like it's the same thing with medicaid where you can't um 

476.81 489.58 B: [noise] [mn] literally you can't be make i think more than [mn] a thousand or something very very low you can't be earning a certain amount um per month [mn] and that way they'll they'll put you on health insurance so it's like y- 

482.04 483.02 A: mhm 

489.56 493.05 B: if you have money you probably can't even afford to get health insurance 

491.95 493.80 A: (( [noise] [laughter] it's true [laughter] )) 

493.26 503.69 B: and then you have to be like very very poor to even get it in which case you've got other problems you know [mn] so i think it's probably the same way with um 

493.90 494.69 A: (( [mn] )) 

497.05 498.10 A: mhm 

499.07 499.99 A: yeah 

503.76 504.32 B: (( [mn] )) 

504.38 507.33 B: and i and i don't know i mean you know of course just 

507.54 513.34 B: looking back at i can't believe it's uh the pace doesn't seem to have kept up 

513.11 513.90 A: yeah 

513.31 525.27 B: with the times i guess you know everything else is going up you've got the subway that just [mn] i mean that's unbelievable and then stamps and um i mean e- e- e- everything else goes up 

514.19 515.37 A: mhm 

517.16 518.32 A: yeah 

519.01 520.06 A: yeah 

521.75 535.39 A: it's true [laughter] yeah [laughter] [mn] and even [laughter] even the rent i i was reading in the newspaper something about the rent is also going to be increasing [mn] as well in new york so it's like wow it's just i don't know it's just amazing 

533.36 548.04 B: right and it and it doesn't seem to be like i said the thing the areas where it could be of help to go up would be here and it doesn't seem to be keeping [mn] pace with um with the higher cost of of living 

540.77 541.91 A: mhm 

547.20 549.21 A: [noise] of living yeah that's true 

548.02 557.55 B: yeah it and it's it's strange 'cause we've got the highest unemployment rate in [mn] i don't know how many years now maybe ten or twenty years now and [mn] and yet everything is 

557.19 558.08 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

557.65 565.61 B: increasing it seems um [mn] and yeah but the rents i i think that just applies to like rent stabilized 

558.48 560.44 A: mhm [noise] mhm 

565.12 566.14 A: okay 

565.59 577.73 B: um apartments but still again a lot of those people are probably um y- you know you have a lot of sort of like artist housing i guess or that sort of thing and um you know these people are not 

573.47 574.46 A: yeah 

574.93 575.93 A: yeah 

577.97 590.54 B: that's probably all they can afford i mean granted you probably have some cushy deals [laughter] where where people who who can afford ten times more than that and and aren't moving you've definitely got you know those people as well [mn] um 

579.50 580.58 A: mhm 

581.95 583.31 A: [laughter] 

585.05 586.11 A: [laughter] 

586.76 587.57 A: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

590.79 599.95 B: [lipsmack] but uh yeah i'm just i'm just amazed 'cause i think that from the last i remember and this was like maybe [mn] ten years ago [mn] maybe the minimum wage was like around
