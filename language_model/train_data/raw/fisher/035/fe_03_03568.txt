0.08 1.28 A: hello 

0.94 2.17 B: hi 

1.80 4.36 A: hi [laughter] my name is 

2.74 5.92 B: thi this is linda and i'm in texas 

5.38 8.17 A: okay this is maria and i'm in um 

8.20 10.62 A: cambridge massachusetts [laughter] 

10.10 13.23 B: oh we're heading that way in a few weeks [laughter] 

12.45 18.42 A: oh really [laughter] um so i guess we're supposed to talk about minimum wage 

18.17 19.38 B: okay 

18.87 19.98 A: (( um )) 

20.06 25.20 B: um i'm retired so [laughter] i've just retired 

22.49 24.23 A: [laughter] 

25.35 26.57 B: (( ah )) 

26.79 32.36 B: so i don't know that much about minimum wage [laughter] i'm at the other end of the market scale 

26.83 27.50 A: is 

29.63 31.24 A: no it's something that you've 

31.97 35.48 A: have t- you not something you've had to contend with [laughter] 

35.09 43.97 B: uh no because i have a well i have children five of them and we all went through the looking for a job and minimum wage and 

43.11 44.35 A: mhm 

44.22 49.00 B: and now i live in an area where uh i live in a 

49.11 53.98 B: technical area that the lay offs are like astronomical everywhere 

50.45 51.26 A: (( mm )) 

53.84 55.15 A: (( oh i- )) 

54.62 56.36 B: and uh 

57.26 64.66 B: so that [sigh] i know an awful lot of retirees and older that are working for a minimum wage 

63.69 69.76 A: minimum wage yeah and i think they sa- i don't know what you heard before we started talking they said 

69.89 73.92 A: that minimum wage is now five dollars and 

74.30 75.96 A: did you hear what 

75.17 78.27 B: and i thought they said fifteen cents and i was 

77.01 79.34 A: yeah that's what i thought they said also 

78.45 82.78 B: and i was thinking to myself i thought it was a lot more than that 

82.20 85.02 A: i did also [laughter] i 

83.92 86.88 B: i thought it was like eight dollars and something 

86.36 93.65 A: [sigh] well i thought it was for some reason the number six seventy five [laughter] is sticking in my mind but i don't 

93.68 103.06 A: um i've i i mean i do- i don't think that i don't even have a family it's i'm just single and i couldn't live on five fifteen an hour 

103.06 104.62 B: and nor could i 

104.06 106.00 A: [laughter] 

105.12 112.17 B: and i also wonder then okay is it different from state to state or is that a federal thing [mn] 

109.92 110.66 A: i 

111.60 112.52 A: i 

112.73 117.98 A: i think that the fed- my understanding of it is that the the fed- federal 

118.54 124.23 A: the they set a minimum rate and that must be five fifteen and then 

124.48 134.58 A: state by state they can make it higher 'cause i'm originally from oregon and i just moved out here not that long ago and in oregon i'm pretty sure that 

135.08 140.28 A: minimum wage y- like any job would be at least six dollars an hour 

140.48 141.47 A: i think 

141.12 146.30 B: well then that's probably well that's why i have this recollection of eight something because 

145.57 148.82 A: yeah it could be higher in in texas 

148.18 151.67 B: i i mean even the mcdonalds starts at [laughter] 

150.72 152.01 A: yeah 

151.70 154.87 B: [laughter] at around there here so 

154.09 155.88 A: yeah that's that's 

155.98 160.23 A: y- yeah i i think that usually even very 

160.31 170.48 A: you know basic level entry level anything a- pays more than five fifteen i don't think i've ever seen a job advertised that only paid that amount 

170.60 174.31 A: and i can't imagine somebody having to live on that amount 

172.91 179.00 B: now maybe that's for restaurant workers [laughter] but who rely on tips 

178.25 180.47 A: oh right yeah i hm 

179.77 180.70 B: uh 

180.77 187.66 B: but i i agree with you i could not possibly live on that even if i had two or three roommates 

184.90 185.99 A: [laughter] 

187.48 192.12 A: yeah i mean that's my situation now i have roommates and um 

192.69 200.63 A: i just y- i don't even li- i'm not living extravagantly by any means and i'm educated and i'm cer- certainly 

200.79 206.28 A: not going to take a job for five fifteen i mean i- anybody who has to that's really 

206.30 208.55 A: unfortunate i guess because 

209.18 214.58 A: [laughter] i mean unless you put you know as many people as could possibly fit in an apartment 

215.19 216.83 A: i just can't imagine 

217.30 218.43 A: (( [lipsmack] yeah )) 

218.88 225.71 B: and i'm assuming that minimum if someone were to take that minimum wage other than maybe the states we live in 

225.84 233.72 B: it would have to be either a fast food or a a waitressing type thing hostessing maybe i uh i 

229.31 231.01 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

231.53 232.67 A: yeah 

233.24 237.25 A: or something with that has tips as well yeah 

235.54 236.43 B: right 

237.40 239.73 B: exactly um 

237.57 238.47 A: yeah 

240.95 244.49 B: labor day laborers i'm sure make more than that 

243.46 247.40 A: they m- yeah i think so i think anything that's 

248.12 262.05 A: some sort of labor job is generally going to make i've been in the job market recently so [laughter] i've been looking and i know a laborer here it's going to be at least twelve dollars an hour starting ten to twelve i would say 

263.31 266.98 A: but that might be i mean cost of living i think is probably higher 

267.17 269.92 B: oh i'm sure it's higher where you live than where i live 

267.34 268.23 A: here 

269.30 271.76 A: yeah than in texas 

272.56 277.67 B: because when i originally grew up in new york the state of new york a- 

276.83 278.92 A: oh see so [laughter] 

277.68 279.76 B: and my husband's from boston 

279.45 283.49 A: uh-huh [laughter] well you know it [laughter] 

280.36 282.12 B: so [laughter] but 

282.67 294.96 B: when we moved down here it was like whoa we going to make this our money stretch [laughter] except you don't take into account at the beginning okay but the salaries are a little different too [laughter] 

288.42 289.78 A: yeah 

294.61 309.47 A: yeah yeah i one of my roommates is going to be moving to arizona and she's very excited about looking at the the rental prices there for apartments and i said but no you're not going to make as much money [laughter] the chances are 

308.07 314.45 B: that's exactly i think it you only make out if you sell a house on either coast and then come here [laughter] 

314.14 319.77 A: yeah yeah that's sort of how you could [laughter] make out well [laughter] 

319.80 321.28 B: but uh 

321.99 327.12 B: cost of living wise uh i don't what else to s- talk about cost of living 

326.52 335.31 A: i don't know well maybe w- can you think of a place that maybe somebody could live on five dollars and fifteen cents an hour [laughter] i just 

334.64 341.63 B: i can't even think well forget alaska or hawaii since everything's so classy 'cause everything has to be shipped in 

339.31 340.97 A: so very yeah 

341.28 342.63 A: yeah 

342.04 343.14 B: um 

343.31 345.51 B: (( [lipsmack] maybe oh )) 

343.54 344.76 A: you certainly 

345.66 348.11 B: well i've never lived in 

348.16 350.50 B: like tennessee kentucky 

350.74 353.11 A: uh-huh kind of more southern 

350.86 353.33 B: (( i don't know maybe appalachia )) 

353.37 365.47 A: that's what i that's that's what popped into my mind and then i thought but there's no the the reputation i've never been there is that there aren't jobs there [laughter] so it is i'm thinking someplace 

361.68 362.92 B: exactly 

363.31 367.61 B: but on the other hand maybe five dollars and fifteen cents would really stretch 

367.10 371.95 A: yeah [laughter] if you're in a rural place and 

372.38 374.87 A: the cost of everything is quite low 

375.19 377.01 A: yeah i don't know 

375.39 381.52 B: ah maybe farming communities where you've grown most of your own food or what have you 

380.49 382.98 A: yeah maybe something like that 

382.48 383.51 B: ah 

384.17 393.89 B: so maybe in the mid west though the towns in the mid west i've been in of course i've only been in cities in the mid west because they were off the highway highway and [mn] 

390.69 392.32 A: yeah yeah which are gonna be 

393.27 396.21 A: more expensive everywhere cities will be 

394.78 395.82 B: (( uh exca- )) 

395.87 397.91 B: mhm ah 

398.17 402.32 B: so now i couldn't [laughter] think of not anywhere in the u._s. 

401.96 403.51 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

403.98 406.65 A: i guess maybe if you had like two [mn] 

404.10 404.85 B: (( so )) 

408.46 413.08 A: if you could actually physically do it if you had a couple of fulltime jobs 

413.22 414.77 A: [laughter] but 

413.92 417.44 B: yeah but then you'd run out of hours to even make it up 

415.78 416.91 A: i yeah 

416.98 419.03 A: yeah you would 

420.23 423.96 B: i mean even working an eighty hour week two jobs 

422.36 427.41 A: i know that's just that would be ridiculous i mean that would be really tough 

425.85 428.10 B: um not for that kind of money 

427.68 429.33 A: yeah yeah 

429.93 434.54 A: well i wonder what um [lipsmack] um jobs like 

435.19 446.53 A: that don't like that are based on sales or something like being a cabdriver i wonder what they make i- compared to minimum wage because i don't 

445.47 447.95 B: (( oh i don't i don't know 'cause )) 

449.65 455.79 A: i don't know if they actually get paid a wage or if it simply comes out of what they actually bring in and it's just 

454.85 457.01 B: now that i have no clue [laughter] 

456.59 458.08 A: i don't either [laughter] 

457.64 460.85 B: [laughter] we don't have all that many cabs here 

460.46 462.13 A: [laughter] 

461.09 464.18 B: [laughter] well at the airport but that's about it 

463.56 465.69 A: (( yeah yeah i don't know [mn] )) 

464.74 465.75 B: um 

467.28 468.62 B: [lipsmack] let's see 

468.99 470.04 B: (( uh i )) 

471.39 474.26 A: (( topics around minimum wage [laughter] i don't know )) 

475.51 477.82 B: mean there's not a lot of say once you've [laughter] [laughter] 

477.61 483.28 A: [laughter] no other than we have concluded that it's very low you couldn't live on it almost anywhere 

483.37 484.68 A: and uh 

483.55 488.52 B: but if they're planning on raising it the rate i agree [laughter] 

487.88 489.68 A: yeah yeah 

489.86 490.92 B: uh 

492.42 494.08 A: are do you know if 

494.19 496.71 A: there is a prospect of it being raised 

494.60 496.86 B: i don't know i i thought that's what 

497.06 500.31 B: did they mention that when they said the topic that there 

499.52 505.01 A: well i think they said it had been raised but to five fifteen [laughter] that 

504.13 510.17 B: well then i have no clue what it [laughter] i don't think it could possibly have been less than that [laughter] 

506.41 507.82 A: yeah i don't 

509.23 512.04 A: like what yeah what was it before they raised 

510.79 513.35 B: well it might have been but not recently 

512.58 517.11 A: yeah yeah i don't know how recently it's been raised or 

517.56 518.76 A: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

520.05 521.48 A: or if it was 

521.87 527.49 A: recently raised to five fifteen i don't know i it's not something that i've heard in the news recently or anything 

527.07 533.18 B: no 'cause my niece is just graduating from high school and she's been working as a hostess 

532.90 534.98 A: mhm yeah and she probably makes more than that 

534.78 544.91 B: and she makes [laughter] yes exactly [laughter] and she makes more than that [laughter] and as a teen- i said there's no way she could live on that that would just about pay for her gas 

536.84 538.24 A: yeah 

539.53 540.49 A: yeah 

544.54 549.24 A: yeah oh really especially with gas prices now [laughter] 

548.12 551.50 B: i ex- exactly well here they're pretty 

549.83 550.87 A: yeah 

551.51 553.58 B: getting better at least 

552.98 554.64 A: yeah yeah 

555.26 556.71 B: (( but um )) 

557.64 565.05 B: they were pretty expensive of course then everything's relative as we said before depending on where you live i mean it was a it's a dollar twenty eight here now 

561.03 563.24 A: right right 

565.04 567.73 A: oh that's not bad [laughter] 

566.49 571.62 B: [laughter] oh i think that's wonderful that we're getting down i keep saying please keep going down 

568.46 569.72 A: [laughter] 

571.41 572.92 A: yeah [laughter] 

572.01 575.56 B: well that's it every time i plan a trip anywhere that's when the ga- 

574.36 576.48 A: it goes up [laughter] [laughter] 

576.84 578.81 B: [laughter] that's very true 

578.57 579.59 A: (( yeah yeah )) 

578.90 583.60 B: but there's no way she could live on and pay her car insurance and 

582.74 584.57 A: oh yeah yeah 

584.75 587.64 A: definitely not i don't i can't imagine that 

589.31 593.54 A: but i and i wonder who the employers are that are paying 

589.38 590.37 B: (( yeah )) 

593.62 596.83 A: like if you have a job that you wanna fill 

597.18 599.98 A: and you're offering five fifteen an hour
