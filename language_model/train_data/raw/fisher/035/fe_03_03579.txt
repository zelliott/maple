24.89 25.93 A: yeah 

29.63 36.30 A: yes i think so too but i don't i'm actually um i work for myself so i don't have to deal with that anymore but

43.38 46.52 B: oh okay so yeah so it goes up and down 

44.31 45.27 A: yeah 

46.11 48.80 A: yeah it just depends on how many shows i have so 

46.98 47.90 B: yeah 

48.76 50.27 B: and see i'm a temp at 

49.14 51.02 A: or how much i sell basically 

51.19 56.91 B: yeah so sometimes you might make make very little and other times you might make a tremendous amount 

52.03 52.85 A: yeah 

53.35 54.83 A: (( [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

56.54 57.98 A: yeah

59.48 63.31 A: i love it [noise] i love their stuff i've i've had shows for like 

63.33 69.24 A: three years i had so after showing finally when i was working i got pregnant and got fired and 

69.26 76.53 A: i said well here's my chance i'll start selling it so [laughter] and i've been doing it for almost a year [noise] almost a year [noise] 

71.92 73.04 B: wow 

75.07 75.99 B: yeah 

76.76 78.78 B: so when you did work 

76.97 77.77 A: yeah 

78.45 79.46 A: mhm 

78.84 82.78 B: the rate that you made then and i mean the thought that you 

80.84 83.48 A: it was like four dollars and something 

83.64 84.23 A: (( [laughter] )) 

83.89 85.07 B: wow 

84.70 85.46 A: yeah 

85.73 91.97 B: yeah so the minimum i mean you would understand there that it should have been more 

87.94 88.76 A: (( [noise] )) 

91.49 93.02 A: yeah yeah [noise] 

92.42 96.83 B: yeah because it's um it's amazing to me how um 

95.14 95.74 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

97.30 104.75 B: you know you can work and it seems like the minimum wage jobs you work harder than the more advanced jobs 

102.46 103.52 A: yeah 

104.05 114.24 A: especially if you're a um waitress i never did that but i know um some friends of mine that were waiters and their minimum wage is actually less than five dollars 'cause they only got like two dollars and something 

114.33 115.80 A: and then they got tips 

116.13 122.35 B: yeah they still do that too it's like they get a very low base and then 

116.48 117.16 A: (( so )) 

118.62 119.70 A: yeah 

121.03 123.21 A: yeah i don't think that's fair [laughter] 

122.62 126.04 B: whatever the tips are because they can make a lot of money like that 

125.37 126.46 A: mhm 

126.13 127.55 B: and um 

127.74 132.09 B: i didn't have the coordination to be you know waitressing 

131.70 143.14 A: i didn't have the patience [laughter] [laughter] i'm like i ain't waiting on these people they're crazy [laughter] [laughter] course now i do that more doing what i'm doing now than i probably would have no that's 

133.07 134.71 B: [laughter] 

136.10 137.76 B: (( [laughter] )) 

142.30 146.12 B: [lipsmack] yeah but it's in a in it's in a different area though 

143.37 145.00 A: not quite so bad [laughter] 

145.63 149.69 A: yeah and it's actually fun [laughter] [laughter] 

146.35 147.74 B: you know i mean 

148.47 157.37 B: yeah and you can you can choose your own time and um because i do temporary work um for a you know a different company 

151.48 152.79 A: yeah 

154.78 155.51 A: uh-huh 

156.67 157.79 A: [noise] uh-huh 

157.54 163.74 B: and it's interesting because they tell me how much it's gonna be and you know of course the price varies 

157.92 158.84 A: (( [noise] )) 

160.60 161.39 A: (( [noise] )) 

161.41 162.37 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah )) 

162.52 164.49 A: [noise]

167.31 167.99 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

168.14 168.70 A: (( [noise] )) 

171.18 172.05 A: mhm 

173.05 180.03 B: you know this is really something for you to go to work for minimum wage and need to be paying rent or make a house payment 

178.12 179.19 A: (( [noise] )) 

179.93 180.67 A: (( [noise] mm ))

188.60 190.54 B: uh pay enough 

190.75 193.17 B: for bills to be paid 

192.63 193.51 A: (( mm mm )) 

193.31 204.31 B: you know and if you do have a family then it's even more difficult and i think the moms should be able to stay home or the dad should be able to stay home if the mom wants to work 

198.01 198.80 A: yeah 

200.38 201.49 A: yeah 

203.95 210.20 A: yeah that's what i did that's why i started doing that too when they fired me i um i decided well i'll just stay home with my daughter [noise] so

219.92 229.34 A: oh i do [laughter] it's hard to imagine i i i could ne- never imagine having a child and then i couldn't imagine now i couldn't imagine having not having her [laughter] 

229.38 231.36 A: (( [noise] so she's something else )) 

229.53 231.95 B: yeah they're pre- they're pretty neat

234.10 235.40 B: (( see well )) 

234.76 238.81 A: oh well let's see what else [noise] hm [laughter] this 

237.53 244.26 B: yeah well i know i know a lot of like with you know different companies and different people that i've spoken with 

243.88 244.70 A: mhm 

244.52 255.32 B: the um the ones that do work for minimum wage um there's a lot of factors that go into that as well where they have to do things on the side as well 

247.77 248.62 A: mhm 

255.14 256.29 A: right 

255.67 264.80 B: you know to bring more money in and granted it's good to be getting the mone- you know the money but when you think about it the taxes that are taken out 

257.66 258.72 A: yeah 

262.17 263.82 A: [noise] 

264.38 265.35 A: mhm 

264.88 266.98 B: you're actually not even making that amount 

266.67 269.29 A: no yeah [noise] yeah 

267.90 275.94 B: you know because it drops down too much and then when the tax time comes up you know hopefully you get the money back 

270.82 271.54 A: mm 

275.47 276.36 A: yeah 

276.05 277.68 B: you know but you might not 

277.50 278.95 A: oh georgia 

277.96 282.90 B: but i just thought you know when they said the topic was you know the minimum wage and i'm like 

283.08 285.00 B: oh boy [laughter] 

283.93 286.14 A: [laughter] and 

285.06 288.44 B: yeah there's a lot that could be said about the minimum wage 

287.62 294.34 A: it's been almost two years since i've been working and then i don't it's been a long time since i actually had to worry about minimum wage 

295.02 297.90 A: i was what probably seventeen i guess 

295.36 296.28 B: (( oh )) 

298.10 301.92 A: [noise] working at the grocery store when i made minimum wage [noise] everything else paid a little bit more 

300.63 301.39 B: (( oh )) 

302.08 303.95 B: well i went to uh i lived 

303.03 304.46 A: [noise] i got lucky i guess 

304.03 314.83 B: i was making two thousand dollars a month in eighty nine in california and then i moved to texas and in seventy no no no in uh ninety one 

313.13 314.65 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

314.74 320.70 B: i went to work for a a retail company and they actually hired me at four twenty five an hour 

316.99 318.23 A: mhm 

320.05 321.81 A: (( [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

320.88 326.55 B: and i just went i don't think i've made four twenty five an hour even the first job that i started with 

323.11 324.75 A: mhm [noise] 

326.23 327.21 A: (( [noise] [noise] yes )) 

326.62 328.37 B: was five something 

328.09 329.15 A: oh wow 

328.38 332.16 B: you know and that was you know in seventy nine and i'm thinking 

330.72 332.69 A: [noise] like a insult [laughter] 

332.64 340.79 B: this is really weird and then i worked for the company for three years my final check from them leaving i was making five thirty five an hour 

340.37 341.11 A: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

341.31 345.16 B: and i just went this is really something because working 

345.39 353.16 B: um you know it we worked hard and the people that i talked to 'cause i talk to just about anybody 

348.01 348.97 A: yeah 

352.68 354.07 A: (( [noise] [noise] yeah [noise] )) 

353.18 362.14 B: um but the people that i do talk with when they say you know what their job is and what they're doing some of 'em make like you know you're wondering how are you doing this 

361.27 363.04 A: (( [noise] right [noise] [noise] )) 

362.46 368.04 B: you know because what they're they're making is just so down there 

367.55 368.67 A: mhm 

368.40 369.77 B: and um 

370.31 372.89 B: you know so i'm like okay well um 

372.44 373.73 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

373.44 379.57 B: you know you're if you enjoy the job it's almost like you're volunteering but you're getting a little bit of a bonus 

377.54 378.93 A: (( [noise] right [laughter] )) 

379.14 382.03 A: yeah [laughter] wh- 

379.84 380.79 B: (( you know )) 

380.97 389.63 B: but so the ones that don't like it then it's you know even more of a hardship but i'm i'm glad that they're getting some type of compensation 

389.95 394.00 B: but it i do think that you know it definitely needs to go up higher 

394.29 396.65 B: because we are not a poor country 

394.30 394.90 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

396.53 397.39 A: right 

397.22 399.73 B: you know and the people that are making 

399.95 401.71 B: big bucks so to speak 

401.74 406.49 B: um yeah i don't know if they were ever in that position where they were making a little bit of money 

404.53 405.24 A: (( [laughter] )) 

406.02 407.17 A: yeah 

406.57 409.05 B: but yeah it it definitely needs to be 

407.61 408.24 A: (( mm )) 

408.62 412.73 A: have you ever thought about doing anything on your own like pamper chef or something like that 

412.33 417.10 B: um i did the uh tupperware i did jafra 

414.84 416.12 A: mhm 

416.79 417.59 A: mhm 

417.45 418.75 B: um 

419.17 425.23 B: and it's it is something where you go in and you know that you've gotta put money out before you can make money 

424.30 426.21 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] right right )) 

425.77 429.56 B: and i you know that's a rough thing for me because i'm 

426.55 427.67 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

429.97 435.17 B: i'm good with people but as far as getting people to set up dates for me to do something 

431.42 432.26 A: mhm 

434.73 435.63 A: right 

435.26 436.04 B: no 

436.06 441.64 A: yeah well once what i had to what i had to do was finally just to get outside of my circle of friends 

436.39 437.35 B: [laughter] 

441.77 444.63 A: and now it seems to be taking off [noise] 

444.45 445.82 B: (( oh )) 

444.89 446.22 A: (( get down georgia )) 

446.75 451.15 A: [noise] [mn] oh she's wanting to get right into everything [laughter] 

447.14 448.16 B: yeah 

450.54 452.03 B: okay 

451.19 454.02 A: [laughter] but uh yeah 

452.89 465.47 B: well what are what are your thoughts i mean as far as i know she's she's little but when she gets to be older i mean would you what would you feel if she went to do something like that and they were saying well we're going to pay you five dollars an hour 

464.56 465.71 A: [noise] 

465.82 467.31 A: (( i'm sorry [noise] )) 

466.56 474.25 B: i s- if if your daughter was gonna go and and to do a job you know when she gets older and if they were saying we're going to pay you five dollars an hour 

468.95 469.70 A: uh-huh 

470.34 471.63 A: mhm 

474.04 488.51 A: oh well by the time that she's working if they're wanting to pay her five dollars an hour they'll be crazy [laughter] [laughter] i hope minimum wage is a lot more than that by then [laughter] that's what it'll be sixteen years or uh fifteen years from now [noise] [laughter] [noise] 

478.06 479.14 B: [laughter] 

483.26 484.51 B: yeah 

487.48 489.37 B: yeah 

488.68 490.42 A: (( i don't know it just depends )) 

490.73 501.95 B: well i know my son is twenty seven and when he was real little you know it was like the amounts of money that were made depending on where you were coming from or what your background was 

492.84 493.58 A: uh-huh 

501.52 502.46 A: (( [noise] uh-huh [noise] )) 

502.06 510.80 B: um varied and when he got older you know he was he went to f- to work for a job where he was actually making more money than i had been 

509.55 511.38 A: (( [noise] [mn] wow )) 

511.21 513.20 B: and then you know he 

512.07 514.86 A: i think men get paid more than us women do anyway [noise] 

515.08 517.38 B: [lipsmack] yeah generally 

516.91 518.07 A: mhm 

517.44 523.78 B: and uh then he went to another job and you know he was making l- lower money higher money lower money 

523.81 525.85 B: and i just went wow you 

525.61 526.33 A: (( hm )) 

525.98 530.53 B: know this is really something 'cause i would like for him to make like unlimited income 

528.19 529.21 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

530.77 532.47 B: but with god's wisdom 

530.93 531.85 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

532.74 533.87 A: (( [noise] mhm )) 

532.79 535.02 B: you know on it so 

535.03 544.72 B: it's uh something but [cough] i think with uh i think if the minimum wage was higher it would possibly um uh 

545.12 548.06 B: eliminate the need for the food stamps as well 

547.65 554.43 A: [noise] yeah [noise] and you'd probably have more people working 'cause they'd actually make it enough to pay for daycare and stuff too [noise] 

548.48 549.90 B: (( you know with people )) 

550.16 551.10 B: (( and )) 

554.34 559.05 B: right yeah that's you know the other conditions too and um 

557.60 558.38 A: (( yeah [noise] )) 

559.23 560.45 B: (( you know it just )) 

560.86 572.30 B: i don't know it to me it seems for the people that are working the minimum wage jobs if they were working more you know better or if they were getting more money it would probably be that um 

566.92 568.00 A: mhm 

568.71 569.29 A: (( [noise] )) 

570.96 571.87 A: [noise]
