2.14 3.93 B: [noise] hi michelle [noise] 

3.74 4.93 A: (( hi michelle )) 

4.06 6.02 B: [noise] how are you doing today 

5.58 6.70 A: [noise] good 

7.10 11.11 A: [mn] good [mn] huh so our topic is minimum wage 

10.34 14.99 B: [noise] [noise] yes [noise] if you think it's sufficient the five fifteen an hour [noise] [noise] 

14.32 17.95 A: yeah no i don't think it is sufficient at all 

17.60 20.02 B: mhm i don't either [laughter] [noise] 

18.79 28.65 A: [laughter] there's there's just so many uh men that [mn] are working at that and they just can't raise a family on that 

20.35 21.42 B: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

28.02 36.78 B: [noise] well my husband makes over thirteen an hour [noise] and we have difficulty [laughter] um taking care of our family [noise] because i am a stay at home mom 

31.90 33.55 A: (( yeah )) 

36.54 37.66 A: yeah 

37.81 39.30 B: (( [noise] )) 

40.03 43.31 B: but um you know five fifteen that that 

43.55 47.58 B: [mn] i don't even think that would pay rent for a month [noise] 

45.95 48.33 A: no and what state are you in 

47.80 49.43 B: i'm in georgia 

48.82 54.16 A: i'm in wisconsin [mn] and it is a little bit uh li- 

50.08 51.30 B: (( [noise] oh okay )) 

53.44 54.41 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

54.06 66.34 A: cheaper to live up here but five fifteen is still not sufficient you know what that's good for a high schooler you know [laughter] but but the wage is good enough for a high schooler [sigh] [mn] [noise] right 

54.50 56.93 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

61.65 63.12 B: right [noise] right 

63.48 64.89 B: [noise] 

65.11 77.85 B: right and that's the problem that we're having is we have so many people that do graduate high school and then go on to graduate college and then they're gonna offer the type of job that that their degree is in right off the bat and they're having to settle for [noise] 

77.84 87.69 B: five dollars and fifteen cents an hour after going to school for four years i mean that's kinda like a slap in the face but i have been out of the workforce for so long 

81.42 82.97 A: right 

83.38 84.38 A: right 

87.79 91.04 B: that that's [mn] [noise] and i think even 

91.14 95.55 B: when i lost my job five years ago to raise my son that um 

95.89 97.82 B: i got paid more than that 

97.51 98.63 A: yeah 

97.87 98.95 B: then 

99.55 100.64 B: so 

100.64 110.23 A: [mn] um i did work [mn] uh started at kmart at five fifteen an hour and and you know just for the amount of work they expect out of you it 

105.24 106.46 B: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

110.25 117.59 A: [mn] ugh they just can't keep employees because uh they're expected to work at a a higher pay 

113.35 114.45 B: [noise] 

118.22 120.67 A: [mn] type of job for the low pay 

121.01 123.72 A: and it was very difficult to 

121.35 122.32 B: (( [noise] [mn] [noise] [noise] )) 

123.99 127.71 A: even get a good wage um check out of that 

125.17 127.12 B: (( [noise] [mn] [noise] exactly )) 

127.84 128.76 A: (( so )) 

129.09 135.19 A: um it should be at least six dollars an hour if not more the minimum wa- yes 

129.78 130.75 B: (( [noise] )) 

132.81 134.60 B: [noise] if not more 

134.86 139.76 B: right well i think one problem that we're having right now is our economy being so low 

138.55 140.60 A: (( yeah yup )) 

140.07 146.84 B: um that people are losing their jobs left and right so they're having no choice but to settle for something 

147.00 150.80 B: like this and like you said i mean that you can't raise a family on that 

150.15 151.52 A: (( right [noise] )) 

150.95 156.25 B: because two people both working for five fifteen are just making ten thirty an hour 

155.76 156.94 A: right 

156.26 161.71 B: and it's like i said we make over thirteen and it's hard to to raise our family 

161.17 165.97 A: right and then if you have to pay for daycare you may as not 

161.81 163.41 B: so [laughter] 

164.58 165.75 B: [noise] 

165.88 169.78 B: work [laughter] right seventy five a week [noise] 

166.12 168.97 A: even work [laughter] 

169.64 170.87 A: yeah 

169.98 171.84 B: that's what it is here i don't know 

172.33 176.38 A: i don't know it's been a long time since i've had my children are all grown 

176.30 177.17 B: (( [noise] )) 

176.65 177.50 A: (( so )) 

177.25 180.15 B: well i know that my son is in a pre k. 

180.11 193.66 B: in the pre k. that he is ian is a daycare center because we couldn't get him in one of the local school pre ks [mn] and their fee is seventy five a week [mn] so if you look at five fifteen an hour 

190.17 191.41 A: (( wow [noise] [noise] )) 

193.71 203.73 B: forty hours a week [noise] not just five dollars an hour forty hours a week is going to be two hundred dollars [noise] after taxes maybe you're gonna [mn] do good to bring home one fifty 

198.72 200.11 A: (( yeah [mn] )) 

203.78 208.51 B: and then turn around and give seventy five of that [noise] to a daycare center if you only have one child 

207.91 214.64 A: right and then to keep up you know you have to buy your lunches and clothing so you just really aren't 

208.90 210.33 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

213.06 214.17 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

214.38 215.35 B: (( ugh )) 

214.89 216.36 A: making anything 

216.71 217.68 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

217.10 218.45 A: which is sad 

218.48 224.46 A: [mn] i'm i've been unemployed now for since august and there's not even a minimum wage jobs around here 

224.38 225.13 B: (( mm )) 

224.80 227.17 A: so it's [mn] pretty tough 

228.02 241.45 B: right well another thing i'm thinking is that it's what's leading to [mn] more and more people being on welfare [noise] [mn] because you look at the fact that why are they gonna go bust [mn] their tails for five dollars an hour when they can sit home 

233.75 234.79 A: (( yup )) 

240.92 242.09 A: right 

241.34 243.40 B: and draw a bigger check than that 

243.05 247.49 A: right well wisconsin has the [mn] pretty strict welfare 

244.65 246.51 B: [noise] 

247.53 259.49 A: um laws too you have to go to work [mn] um so which is good i mean you've given like two years to get a job and then after that if you don't well your welfare's cut off also 

250.28 251.75 B: [noise] mhm [noise] 

259.39 261.11 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

259.96 260.92 A: (( [mn] so )) 

261.18 268.00 A: [mn] it's which is good because it makes people do something [laughter] just sit around so 

265.99 267.95 B: oh yeah exactly [noise] 

268.61 275.14 B: but you do have so many people that like you said it's not worth working and having a child in 

268.78 269.34 A: (( [mn] )) 

272.08 273.43 A: right 

275.41 280.90 B: daycare but at the same time they're single [noise] parents so they just sit home [laughter] 

276.19 277.21 A: right 

280.59 281.54 A: yeah 

280.96 284.39 B: so where if the incentive was there for they can make more 

283.94 285.02 A: right 

284.59 285.59 B: or 

285.90 286.65 B: (( you know )) 

287.09 288.26 B: it's like [mn] 

288.32 293.56 B: everything is going up your cost of living is going up so much 

293.04 293.86 A: (( yup )) 

293.75 297.19 B: but the wages are not going up with the cost of living 

296.66 298.06 A: no they're not 

297.87 301.91 B: and that is a very very big problem 

301.59 302.72 A: (( yup )) 

302.76 303.53 A: (( yup )) 

303.38 310.43 B: [noise] because i know you know to hear my grandmother talk in her day two hundred dollars a w- well a hundred and fifty dollars a week [noise] would have been like 

310.79 313.30 B: a thousand a week now you know 

312.53 314.48 A: (( [mn] [laughter] yup yup )) 

313.44 315.11 B: and so [laughter] 

315.30 316.63 B: that's just 

315.38 316.43 A: oh 

317.07 321.19 B: amazing i know it's very h- i did it is this is this your first call that you've done 

320.42 322.00 A: this is my second one 

321.50 327.10 B: okay [mn] this is my second it's very hard to keep [mn] a topic going for ten minutes [laughter] 

324.79 333.66 A: i know it is it is [laughter] i actually had a very good topic yesterday but [laughter] [mn] yes 

330.72 332.47 B: [mn] [noise] was it the life mate 

333.01 338.99 B: that's what mine was yesterday but it's still kinda difficult for you know ten whole minutes to 

333.85 335.62 A: (( yup yup [mn] )) 

337.71 340.26 A: (( right it is for strangers but )) 

339.31 343.86 B: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

340.20 343.70 A: it's kinda fun you know i told my husband get off the phone 'cause i'm gonna m- 

343.65 355.33 A: make ten dollars [laughter] [mn] this is about working two hours a minimum wage you know [laughter] yeah [laughter] 

349.68 351.67 B: (( [mn] [noise] oh yeah )) 

351.71 357.54 B: for ten minutes on the phone [laughter] [mn] [noise] 

355.20 364.32 A: [mn] um i don't know if there's any legislation to raise the minimum wage or not i i haven't been keeping uh in touch with that i guess [noise] [mn] 

357.56 359.04 B: [noise] 

359.52 360.51 B: [noise] 

360.73 362.27 B: (( no well )) 

363.64 365.51 B: i don't know either um 

365.62 367.21 B: 'cause like i said [noise] i've been 

368.18 369.82 B: (( [noise] )) 

369.60 370.50 A: (( oh ))

391.44 392.65 A: right 

392.18 400.94 B: extra [noise] because like i said y' kn- [noise] because like you know i i don't see how people can make it off of five dollars an hour 

400.00 401.15 A: (( [noise] [noise] no ))
