0.00 2.10 B: (( [noise] hello )) 

0.30 1.46 A: hello 

1.96 5.23 A: hi my name's amy i'm from kansas how are you 

4.86 7.79 B: [noise] hi i'm michelle i'm from erie pennsylvania 

7.59 8.60 A: cool 

8.34 9.43 B: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

9.04 11.80 A: well so our topic is [sigh] um 

10.90 12.24 B: minimum wage 

12.01 16.27 A: minimum wage yes that it's what five fifteen an hour right now 

15.64 16.47 B: uh-huh 

17.15 18.09 A: um 

18.18 21.75 A: that's kind of a hard topic for me i think because 

22.56 23.48 A: um 

24.68 33.39 A: it doesn't seem like a lot but then i understand when you look at the economics of it when you continue to raise the minimum wage 

29.45 30.26 B: mhm 

33.45 40.62 A: it affects all of the other jobs and it can actually kind of create a crisis in the economy 

38.45 40.24 B: (( [noise] right )) 

41.79 42.93 A: so [sigh] 

42.36 47.16 B: right and plus it makes it i think difficult for probably small business owners [noise] 

46.91 47.91 A: right 

48.46 53.45 B: um [noise] you know to try to keep up with the increasing wages 

53.45 54.56 A: right 

53.91 56.30 B: and you know run a business and everything 

56.91 57.86 B: um 

58.05 66.01 B: y- yeah it's kind of a catch twenty two i mean if you're if you're seeking a minimum wage job of course you want uh you know as much as you can get 

65.69 66.91 A: right 

66.26 70.78 B: but um when you're looking at it from the employers' side um 

71.30 72.76 B: that can be a problem 

72.61 73.50 A: right 

74.21 74.81 B: (( [noise] )) 

74.41 77.29 A: so i think yeah i mean just 

77.84 82.69 A: i think it's probably good to stay where it's at i don't think it should raise any higher 

83.07 84.08 A: um 

84.28 91.29 A: 'cause i think sometimes that people who are entering the job markets today and i mean you know those who are right out of high school 

91.87 92.88 A: um 

94.23 98.53 A: from my experience and just looking at my siblings i'm kind of it's hard to get in 

95.51 96.46 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

96.51 108.10 B: [laughter] [noise] [noise] my toddler's just having a meltdown right this minute hey [laughter] hey [noise] you need to cool it [noise] now i told you no juice milk 

100.32 101.58 A: oh that's okay 

108.39 109.06 B: [laughter] 

109.05 109.92 A: [laughter] 

109.23 113.12 B: i i'm having a problem with him he only wants to drink juice 

111.15 112.13 A: oh 

113.24 120.63 B: and i you can't drink juice all day long [laughter] and um so [laughter] i'm trying to 

116.06 118.64 A: that's right yeah that's right [laughter] 

121.86 125.00 B: let him have his meltdown hoping it would pass but it [laughter] 

125.66 129.28 B: i think it i think it is now [laughter] okay i'm sorry 

127.92 131.36 A: well way to good good to stick with it [laughter] 

130.49 136.18 B: well he has to 'cause i mean otherwise he would he would just dr- and it and dad will just give him juice all day long 

135.83 136.74 A: right 

136.23 139.47 B: and so then i'll take him water the juice down in the jug 

139.76 147.12 B: [laughter] so that he's not getting all juice because i know that's what dad does [laughter] but anyway 

143.96 145.26 A: right right 

146.72 153.12 A: yeah i think i think you know keeping the minimum wage at five fifteen right now is sufficient 

153.45 159.27 A: because from my point of view i think too many um individuals who are just entering into the workforce 

159.44 163.64 A: are expecting to make almost fifty thousand dollars a year from their first job 

163.81 165.94 A: and that's impossible 

165.64 166.86 B: well yeah 

166.23 171.74 A: and and i think it's good for the work ethic for people to understand that they have to start out small 

171.61 174.20 B: right and work up 

172.17 173.10 A: and 

173.19 176.25 A: and work up and the value of savings because 

176.28 181.85 A: you know we um have become a very material society materialistic and you know we expect to have 

181.92 191.79 A: everything now you know and i fall into that trap and sometimes i have to understand you know i'm not going to have everything that my parents have now because they've been in 

191.92 206.25 A: working a whole lot longer they have saved they have raised a family they have progressed in their jobs and therefore they're going to be making more and i have to understand that i need to live within my means and just stay where i'm at you know and just continue to work up 

206.67 208.03 B: right 

206.67 211.88 A: so i think for that reason i think it's also good that the minimum wage stays small 

211.98 215.00 A: it should have to increase though with um 

214.68 216.46 B: account with the economy mhm 

216.12 222.02 A: well right yeah what what do you call it um [lipsmack] inflation and just you know um 

223.16 227.16 A: oh what do they call that um living wage you know 

224.83 225.80 B: [laughter] 

226.49 227.62 B: right right 

227.34 234.91 A: you know so but then i think i mean because when you consider most minimum wage jobs they are entry level jobs 

234.54 235.27 B: right 

235.03 237.11 A: and um 

237.39 242.72 A: [noise] for someone usually in the entry level positions [noise] they 

243.16 244.14 A: um 

245.71 246.74 A: are 

247.08 252.68 A: probably even either living home at home [noise] with their parents or they're living with maybe some roommates 

247.43 248.08 B: (( [noise] )) 

252.66 253.52 B: right 

252.88 256.57 A: [noise] [noise] so maybe i mean i don't know if i'm just categorizing them 

255.80 261.78 B: well it's not you know that's not always true because like i'm i'm older and um 

260.11 261.48 A: right [noise] 

262.03 265.47 B: i've i mean i've been a mom since i was nineteen 

263.91 266.35 A: [noise] right [noise] 

265.72 270.23 B: and so all i've i i haven't i've been a stay at home mom 

269.97 270.93 A: right 

270.31 276.37 B: and if i wanted to go into the workforce the only kind of job i'm going to be able to get is a minimum wage job 

276.03 277.00 A: yeah 

276.40 284.35 B: now if i had to if for some reason i didn't have you know my husband supporting me and i had to do it on my own that would very very difficult 

284.04 285.73 A: (( right that's true )) 

284.52 290.87 B: i would i i mean i'd have to work you know several jobs and yes i could work my way up but you know 

290.96 295.01 B: for that time when i was only making minimum wage it would be extremely difficult 

294.77 295.96 A: right 

296.19 303.95 B: um so from you know from that side it it's kind of hard because there are a lot of times situations where you know 

303.96 311.01 B: people haven't ha- you know they you don't have the education or there are just not you know higher level jobs available 

311.06 316.14 B: and so you have to take a minimum wage job and it just doesn't cut it 

315.33 318.37 A: right right and that is hard you know 

318.74 323.62 A: and i think that's why there is such a battle over what the minimum wage should be because 

322.79 324.20 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

324.14 327.51 A: you know there are people similar to that situation saying 

327.52 330.88 A: this is impossible to live on i'm trying to raise a family 

329.62 331.35 B: [noise] right 

331.22 335.09 A: you know and then [sigh] i mean i know that the government does offer some 

335.44 341.10 A: support but there are a lot of people who say you know i don't wanna have to do that i want to be able to work on my own 

338.75 339.96 B: well 

341.19 354.06 B: an- and the thing that's hard too though even about the support because years a- years ago i was in that position and the thing is that as soon as you start making you know any kind of money then they take that out of the support you get 

353.89 354.92 A: right 

354.33 363.99 B: so basically you're still [laughter] not getting anywhere and that's why so many people are you know i- like stay in that like welfare rut 

357.33 358.35 A: right 

363.82 364.74 A: right 

364.07 372.68 B: because you know to go and get a job then they're going to lose their benefits and their [noise] benefits are actually better than you know [noise] [laughter] the the job 

372.39 373.93 A: well right yeah 

373.30 376.04 B: and and so and so they just you know 

376.01 390.72 B: try to stay there beca- i mean they've changed things a lot i mean now you can't just like sit in you know on welfare for years and years you have to go out and get a job but but it's still it's hard because as soon as you start making anything they take that money or you know or whatever food stamps or whatever away 

384.03 384.97 A: right 

390.37 391.22 A: right 

390.57 394.82 B: and then you know you're still in that position where you don't have enough to make ends meet [noise] 

394.33 400.16 A: right right and you don't have the opportunity to try and save to get out of that position and start making a better life 

397.94 403.22 B: [noise] ri- [noise] [noise] yeah it's a vicious circle it it it it's really hard 

400.87 401.77 A: right 

403.30 404.10 A: hm 

403.97 406.70 B: [laughter] it's a tough dilemma 

406.35 409.83 A: [laughter] yeah so they're almost creating the problem it seems like 

407.44 408.74 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

409.26 414.98 B: [noise] it it's not a black and white issue it there's just too many grey areas [noise] 

410.39 411.19 A: (( so )) 

412.18 413.17 A: [noise] 

414.26 417.34 A: right and that and that's very true that's very very true 

415.52 416.85 B: [noise] 

418.80 420.58 A: i don't know i mean 

420.25 420.86 B: (( [noise] )) 

421.20 423.14 B: (( [noise] [noise] oh no )) 

425.14 426.45 B: go on [laughter] i'm sorry 

426.48 429.01 A: well i'm just trying to think um because 

429.06 430.53 B: i know we're starting to 

430.62 432.67 B: run out of steam here [laughter] 

432.26 433.65 A: (( yeah [noise] [noise] yeah [laughter] )) 

433.00 437.35 B: some some topics are really easy to keep talking about and others it's like you kinda [laughter] 

438.03 440.61 B: this is my third my third phone call 

440.32 441.55 A: yeah same here 

441.25 442.47 B: really [laughter] 

441.88 444.54 A: yeah i don't know i mean 

442.57 443.67 B: [laughter] 

445.49 446.43 A: gee 

447.05 452.44 A: i mean i i i again like i said i think that minimum wage i think it's fair where it's at 

451.40 455.27 B: where it is right now probably yeah um 

452.71 453.58 A: right 

453.85 457.23 A: right but then you know i do see your concerns too 

456.38 460.52 B: but yeah but it's just that there's a lot of variables um 

459.17 460.17 A: right 

461.14 468.79 B: yeah if i were to need to go out and get a job at this point there it's just no way because then you'd h- i'd have to pay for day- daycare 

468.54 469.72 A: right 

469.11 474.33 B: and that would take e- everything that i would make and then it'd be like why work [laughter] 

472.37 473.26 A: right 

473.81 478.65 A: right yeah i know i'm a stay at home mom too thinking there's no way that i should work [noise] because it's 

478.50 483.54 B: well it's true though i mean i've never i mean i've [laughter] i keep having kids [laughter] 

482.44 483.46 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

483.64 488.57 B: [laughter] i'm forty two and i have a an eight month old and a two year old 

488.28 489.20 A: right 

489.74 493.91 B: and then i have a a twenty two year old and a seventeen year old and an eight year old [laughter] 

493.41 494.64 A: [laughter] 

493.92 495.55 B: oh boy [laughter] 

494.93 496.45 A: [laughter] oh wow 

496.12 498.70 B: [laughter] but um 

498.74 505.31 B: yeah for me it just it would not be feasible to go out and work and have to pay which i wouldn't want to anyway i mean 

504.95 505.89 A: right 

505.91 511.47 B: um put my children in daycare i want i had them 'cause i wanna you know be there for 'em myself 

510.97 511.83 A: right 

511.57 515.79 B: so the only other option is to try try to find something to work um from home 

515.68 516.58 A: right 

517.98 521.92 A: well and i think [cough] i think an answer to that kind of a situation too 

522.31 526.15 A: is that if you [noise] had to go out into the workforce 

526.28 535.71 A: i think there are a lot of employers that are able to [noise] help with education basically they reimburse you for education and you say you know 

535.89 547.65 A: i am willing to work for you and i want to progress in my knowledge of this area so i can continue to be a benefit to you and a service to you as well as progress in my [noise] job skills and so 

547.47 557.33 A: [mn] a lot of employers would u- um pay you a certain amount and then they would also reimburse you for any schooling expenses which makes it nice and i know that the government [noise] has also 

557.42 560.94 A: said that you can take so much out of your taxes for schooling 

561.21 567.78 A: so they do try and promote that but i don't think you know like you were saying and the welfare situation it's kind of a a vicious cycle 

562.62 563.26 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

567.79 571.27 A: i think maybe they need to promote those other items more 

571.53 574.44 A: to show that there are options out there and that you can 

574.46 582.77 A: you know for those who might be returning to the workforce um or are just getting started maybe at a later age that there are options for them 

582.79 591.22 A: to really benefit you know instead of raising the minimum wage to where you know all of a sudden it's ten dollars an hour and everyone else gets the gyp 

583.83 584.98 B: right 

591.45 599.89 A: you know what i'm saying because i think that's one of the reasons why we with the minimum wage continuing continually rising i think that's why we see so many 

592.14 592.74 B: (( [noise] [noise] ))
