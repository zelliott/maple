200.72 201.67 A: i know 

202.21 203.11 A: i know 

203.33 214.83 A: [lipsmack] and then the- they ju- they just not long ago raised it to that 'cause it wasn't that i see i was trying to remember you know before you came on i was trying to remember what it was before they did raise it to five fifteen 'cause it was lower than that

224.25 230.29 B: [noise] i i really don't remember what it was at when i was working i think it was four 

230.94 234.04 B: seventy when i was getting paid 

232.51 241.53 A: [sigh] is that is that what it was 'cause that at my last where i was waitressing um a girl came in and she just moved down here from up north [sigh] to get a job 

234.11 235.05 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

241.69 251.83 A: and um well i was talking to her she filled her application out and i was talking to her [sigh] and she was asking how much we make an hour and i told her you know two thirteen and tips and she about died

252.97 253.97 B: (( yah )) 

256.28 268.43 A: and it's two thirteen plus tips [sigh] now there are some companies [sigh] um but that's your bigger companies like bennigan's and stuff like that [sigh] i don't know if bennigans does it uh where was it [lipsmack] anyway they they do give you raises [sigh] 

269.10 274.60 A: uh maybe it's lo- maybe it's logan steakhouse [sigh] you know like every six months or so you you have to take a test 

269.27 270.15 B: (( yeah [sigh] )) 

274.78 277.29 B: yeah to meet and then [noise] if you pass 

274.94 282.68 A: and yeah yeah and they give you it's like a ten cent raise you know something like that from two thirteen 

277.60 278.57 B: (( yeah mm )) 

281.59 287.25 B: like that ten cents or even a nickle every now and then it sure helps 

286.90 289.49 A: yeah yeah anything helps 

287.36 288.24 B: [laughter] 

289.67 299.96 A: [sigh] and everything's getting it's er everybody's moving here from up north where you know staying because of work and everything is more and more expensive [sigh] now you can't afford to go anywhere 

293.32 294.13 B: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

296.63 297.42 B: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

299.66 300.59 B: (( [noise] no )) 

300.87 305.92 B: [noise] it's like er [noise] when i lived [noise] 'cause i i'm not originally from here 

305.60 308.50 A: (( [sigh] see i i'm from here i was born and raised here [sigh] [lipsmack] )) 

308.40 311.75 B: it's like 'cause i i moved down here from michigan 

311.56 313.39 A: okay my i have family there 

313.37 316.51 B: it's like and i i'm pretty sure i think 

316.90 323.57 B: 'cause i hadn't worked w- long time when i was up there either 'cause i ended up having um two children 

324.04 326.02 B: and then i moved down here 

326.77 331.32 B: [sigh] and my goodness [sigh] there there was a big difference in in 

331.59 333.08 B: the work 

332.47 345.13 A: yeah um my cousin she she's older she's my mom's age [sigh] they were raised together and her husband she doesn't have to work [sigh] uh i forget what he does um but he makes he makes like twenty five an hour
