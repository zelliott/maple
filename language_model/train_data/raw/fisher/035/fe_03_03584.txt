45.07 46.11 A: yeah 

47.05 55.55 A: i think that's like a horrible horrible wage and that's just not like actually even what i would consider a raise because 

55.50 64.33 A: i used to work my ass off for five fifteen an hour like back in ohio and i moved here to new york and like 

64.62 74.49 A: did like half the work and made more money and like i found it to be a better working environment i found myself going home and feeling much happier and everything you know 

74.27 82.45 A: i don't feel so disgruntled and like not look forward to work or like always like want to call off or like you know what i'm saying 

82.72 95.00 A: just it's it it's so much better on the employees and like everybody around plus like they take out so much like state tax and everything you know it really does need to be more than five fifteen 

95.49 101.85 B: i just i'm still in amazement that people actually work for five fifteen an hour [laughter] 

100.41 109.40 A: [laughter] yeah i know it i think that's just like almost like child slavery or like or like you know just putting people under slavery for five fifteen 

102.23 103.19 B: (( i )) 

109.44 110.63 A: like it's just ri- 

109.85 112.87 B: well and if you look at the cost of living 

113.24 117.73 B: for one single person with no children whatsoever 

118.08 121.74 B: if they worked eighty hours at five fifteen 

121.75 129.94 B: they might squeeze in rent and groceries i guess they'll just have to hustle for the likes of gas 

127.88 132.68 A: yeah like where goes the phone bill your computer bill you know 

132.85 136.04 A: electric all your bills you know [laughter] 

136.11 140.22 A: you and what if they wanna have a pet because they don't have family you know 

136.40 137.92 B: (( i don't )) 

140.64 152.96 B: i really feel the minimum wage doesn't too much affect me because i really don't know anybody that would actually work for that i'm wondering who offers that 

148.98 151.04 A: see well i would i'm like 

151.37 152.93 A: (( h- how old are you )) 

153.24 154.10 B: thirty 

154.00 161.15 A: okay i'm nineteen and when i used to work for five fifteen i was seventeen and eighteen years old 

161.23 164.08 A: you know like my i currently work for 

163.14 165.86 B: and what did you do for five fifteen an hour or 

165.08 175.88 A: i worked at i worked at a restaurant like not a restaurant but i worked at like a little like greek restaurant by these two bus- like they owned it it was a family business 

166.07 167.00 B: lower 

172.65 174.37 B: mhm 

175.75 177.44 B: mhm 

175.82 183.05 A: and i dish washed i did like cleaned off all the grills i cleaned i put together sandwiches orders 

180.38 184.32 B: uh-uh so that's like serious labor 

183.73 187.54 A: yeah and that was it's in ohio it's pretty bad [laughter] 

188.17 189.15 A: so 

188.30 194.81 B: i just wonder what shops pay that what what you had to do to get that much money an hour [laughter] 

194.83 196.12 B: oh that's ugly 

195.84 207.01 A: yeah and let me see i also worked at a car wash for a while and i just pretty much all i did was like i was a salesperson i sold like car washes and that was about it 

206.80 208.62 B: well that's not too hard though 

208.09 210.00 A: no that wasn't too bad 

208.65 209.62 B: okay 

209.77 213.45 B: you wouldn't feel too bad about the whole five dollars an hour thing 

211.47 215.52 A: but uh yeah i ended up getting commission and then like a little raise but 

215.68 217.18 A: like now i don't 

217.37 227.59 A: like i live in new york and it's a whole another world when it comes to i don't even think minimum wage exists other than mcdonalds [laughter] here it's that's about it so 

224.79 226.78 B: yeah 

228.33 236.26 A: and mostly like it seems like younger kids work at the mcdonalds around here so it seems so far and foreign people 

236.54 237.45 A: so 

237.81 244.59 A: i don't know yeah i think minimum wage though it's kind of like a trap for people who are just coming here as well 

239.03 240.27 B: (( i just think )) 

244.97 252.74 B: i would think before anybody should take that minimum wage they would go to serving or something where they get tips 

253.20 262.10 A: yeah yeah tips there's a good way but then again when you think about it server's minimum wage is like two fifteen three fifteen or something 

254.52 257.39 B: something would have to 

261.53 264.08 B: two thirteen but 

263.42 265.08 A: something weird 

264.24 269.00 B: if you figure you can serve an average of 

269.62 275.48 B: [mn] thirty tables you know at each table you make six to eight bucks 

274.50 289.45 A: but also it depends on the area you're working in you might be what if you live in a small town where like most of like people that live there are divorced and like don't have families you're probably going to get like less tips because you know just the kind of surrounding you're in if you're like in a busy like 

284.77 285.87 B: [noise] 

289.33 297.15 A: metro area you're probably going to make tons of tips like in a city surrounding or you know it also depends on your area so [mn] 

297.26 303.71 A: you know like yeah minimum wage like see where i came from in youngstown there it was not like a big area so 

304.29 306.35 B: (( oh yeah )) 

304.42 307.21 A: like you didn't get major tips like the girls 

306.44 319.37 B: i would say that's the closest i've come to making like minimum wage and when i first started off to pay for college i served and i served at a little truck stop in fortville indiana 

313.43 314.35 A: mhm 

318.80 319.78 A: mhm 

319.52 323.88 B: and would walk out with a hundred bucks a night on top of my little two eleven 

323.97 325.57 A: oh yeah 

324.01 324.92 B: an hour 

325.13 328.25 B: what's crazy was when i was sixteen 

328.78 330.87 B: and it was two eleven 

331.42 334.45 B: it is still like two thirteen 

335.43 336.16 A: [laughter] 

336.04 340.73 B: i wonder if waitresses like are aware of the whole minimum wage thing 

340.55 342.98 A: wow maybe not 

343.72 347.05 A: because if it hasn't like really changed that much 

346.81 349.87 B: i mean you're talking about when i was sixteen i'm thirty 

349.86 351.29 A: yeah 

350.50 356.13 B: and they've got two cents i wonder what they got off of this a dollar or like one cent 

351.83 363.25 A: that [laughter] wow two cents woo-hoo [laughter] that's like [laughter] [laughter] yeah that's like nothing so 

356.67 361.40 B: you might make two fourteen an hour now hey hey [laughter] 

362.81 370.52 B: you know i think they need to stop focusing on the minimum wage because nobody seems to make it 

369.97 371.77 A: (( yeah )) 

370.60 373.87 B: even mcdonalds pays over minimum wage 

373.17 379.84 A: no no they really don't but like it's there's still like areas where they don't make you know 

379.72 383.43 B: it just seems they need to focus on healthcare a little bit better 

379.86 381.98 A: they a whole bunch of money is 

382.62 386.57 A: just yeah and i definitely agree on the healthcare 

384.13 389.42 B: make the people paying the minimum wage be able to afford the health plans 

387.95 388.71 A: (( k- )) 

388.77 394.95 A: it's kind of a weird thing to be thinking about like prices and like you know minimum wage like because 

389.44 392.08 B: at their minimum wage job 

394.89 405.18 A: you don't know what the economy's doing right now why add on to like more money problems why not like work on like helping people that are dying and like who needed you know 

405.21 419.30 A: better coverage 'cause they can't afford it with their m- yeah maybe some of these people aren't on healthcare can't afford it 'cause they're making minimum wage or pretty close to you gotta think of that too maybe healthcare problems are because of minimum wage 

415.63 417.79 B: they put you in a catch twenty two 

418.82 421.68 B: if you have a job you can't get medic aid 

422.22 425.30 B: but your job only pays enough to 

425.49 428.88 B: barely cover your bills minimum wage 

429.65 433.00 B: so how could you possibly think of a healthcare plan 

433.53 434.83 B: they need to stop 

435.54 436.81 B: separating them 

437.47 444.01 B: if they're going to raise the minimum wage give the people a health plan with their minimum wage job 

444.03 447.66 A: yeah that would like kind of like in canada 

445.51 446.53 B: you know 

447.38 448.54 B: benefits 

448.64 454.02 A: that's kind of like what canada has pretty much as long as you're a resident there you got free health coverage 

454.46 456.23 A: so and that's pretty cool 

456.55 460.46 B: but i don't see anybody making five fifteen an hour able to 

461.45 463.08 B: pay for insurance 

464.32 465.99 A: for for what 

465.87 468.17 B: insurance for healthcare 

466.03 470.95 A: oh no yeah nobody who has five fifteen makes gets any kind of insurance 

472.41 473.97 A: or anything like that so 

475.53 476.72 A: it's a shame 

477.02 477.99 A: (( i don't know )) 

477.87 483.54 B: and the question was is it enough hell it ain't been enough forever [laughter] 

483.24 487.21 A: [laughter] yeah it isn't enough it's never enough nothing's ever enough 

483.94 486.89 B: [laughter] [laughter] 

487.92 489.81 A: oh man yeah that's 

490.29 491.21 A: no way 

490.63 496.11 B: i thought i i but you know what's ugly is i always thought it was around seven bucks 

492.73 498.41 A: i don't know i thought it was around six six fifty seven dollars yeah that's decent 

497.10 499.69 B: i thought that was minimum wage 

499.38 501.72 A: you did well see that's what it should be 

500.47 501.64 B: [laughter] 

503.48 505.17 A: (( but )) 

503.70 506.49 B: i guess i need to get out and 

506.55 509.30 B: learn more about the economy or something 

508.34 514.47 A: yeah [laughter] or yeah turn on that station called ny [laughter] 

513.19 518.17 B: i was like this is a raise [laughter] whoa [laughter] 

514.87 522.39 A: [laughter] how how long have you been doing this like how many of these have you done 

518.25 519.13 B: (( hm )) 

522.23 524.24 B: uh this is my third one 

523.90 526.81 A: oh cool did you get paid yet for any of 'em or 

526.64 528.88 B: no but um 

529.71 532.16 B: they all came like right in a row 

531.85 541.91 A: yeah that's pretty much how mine have come too like all in a row too i just had three of 'em one i had to hang up on them because i was in the middle of like leaving to go to the movies and i'm like um 

541.80 552.17 A: x. men two or talk to you on the phone i got to go [laughter] but yeah see yeah it i wonder how much somebody makes working at a movie place 

545.45 547.47 B: right 

552.44 554.66 A: they probably make minimum wage 

553.20 560.60 B: i think i've seen five fifty [laughter] and that's much more than they just said this raise was too 

556.53 557.95 A: (( yeah )) 

558.84 562.58 A: yeah i would yeah five fifteen isn't on 

560.66 567.47 B: that's why i don't understand it i mean i have four kids they're not mine i mean stepchildren 

566.64 568.14 A: how old are they like 

568.54 581.63 B: the oldest one is sixteen and the one under him is fifteen and they both have jobs the fifteen year old works at mcdonalds under a work permit and he makes six dollars an hour 

578.76 579.77 A: mhm 

581.41 582.96 A: oh really 

582.12 589.73 B: so i'm just really confused on this whole minimum wage thing i thought i thought it was something like way higher 

585.67 587.52 A: hm yeah 

589.41 595.12 A: so it maybe it is just like a trap for immigrants or something like you know what i'm saying 

594.58 599.01 B: like if you wanna pick these strawberries we'll give you this much 'cause we're forced to 

599.06 599.89 B: i just don't
