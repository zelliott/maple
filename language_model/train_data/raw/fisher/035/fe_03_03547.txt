172.70 174.87 A: what is that 

173.00 173.98 B: i think 

175.13 186.48 B: uh and what about benefits that go with that do you think that even at five fifteen an hour if they had ample benefits to supplement their hourly wage do you think that that would make a big difference 

183.80 186.54 A: (( what )) 

186.66 191.19 A: [mn] yes if they got insurance and didn't have to pay for it 

190.18 192.56 B: (( yeah [laughter] that's a whole [mn] )) 

191.30 195.04 A: it would make it would make a big difference

197.14 198.17 B: um 

198.47 199.80 B: that uh 

201.71 203.18 B: (( gosh i don't know )) 

203.21 205.13 A: [laughter] i don't um 

206.01 209.12 A: [mn] i think it's okay for a kid to make that though 

209.87 219.58 B: [noise] pardon yeah for a kids yeah [mn] uh just something or maybe to supplement an income but not as a primary source of income 

219.67 223.95 A: r- exactly i don't even think i'd do as the second income 

224.83 226.56 A: it doesn't seem worth it 

226.71 230.18 B: no uh um and it would depend on what the job was 

227.96 228.97 A: (( [noise] )) 

230.40 231.41 A: (( [noise] yeah )) 

230.66 231.61 B: (( um )) 

231.45 234.53 A: nothing hard labor not for that 

234.22 246.64 B: and if you're being paid minimum wage do you feel like that that's going to affect the caliber of employee that you get do you feel like if the more job pays that you're gonna get a better employee or do you think 

246.44 248.53 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

246.54 253.96 B: somebody's gonna work you don't think somebody's gonna work just as hard for five fifteen an hour as they would for six fifty 

253.13 256.83 A: [noise] [noise] i think if you're getting paid five fifteen an hour 

257.40 268.30 A: but you're like if you work if they you know you work hard they'll give ya like an incentive or something yeah but if they're not giving you an incentive and saying you're working you're making five fifteen an hour then 

263.73 264.79 B: yeah 

268.47 269.77 B: right 

269.15 271.30 A: (( ouch [laughter] [noise] [noise] )) 

270.47 278.66 B: if i had committed to a job which i would not want to work for minimum wage but if i committed to a job for five fifteen an hour 

278.68 288.01 B: i would work just as hard for that five fifteen an hour as i would for eight dollars and hour i'd just be looking for another job the [laughter] whole time 

284.20 286.22 A: [noise] right [noise] 

287.53 289.01 A: [laughter] [noise] 

287.86 301.51 B: but it would not affect my work ethics and i would follow through with uh whatever commitment i made but uh [mn] and money for me would be a motivator but as far as affecting my job performance 

294.47 296.05 A: right 

300.64 303.10 A: [noise] [noise] mhm [noise] 

301.47 306.10 B: i would still give my hundred and ten percent if i made five fifteen or if i made 

305.60 307.00 A: [noise] 

306.13 307.77 B: fifteen an hour 

307.60 313.27 A: right y- you're right [noise] i i probably would do the same thing but 

308.02 309.69 B: (( but uh [mn] [noise] )) 

313.72 319.83 A: i wouldn't be as motivated i don't know i've never been in that situation [noise] [noise] 

317.19 318.20 B: yeah 

319.25 320.37 B: right 

320.04 323.72 A: (( [noise] [laughter] )) 

320.58 322.35 B: right 

322.42 327.86 B: [noise] well gosh let's see let me think about other things about minimum wage um 

330.18 343.70 B: are you familiar with all of the burdens that are placed on employers aside from employees wages such as carrying benefits and workman's compensation and 

343.78 347.27 A: mm mm what do what do you do for a living 

344.86 345.75 B: no 

347.95 352.87 B: [mn] oh my goodness um i'm editing i do edits and 

353.00 359.07 B: i had i used to have a temporary personnel service and i sold it in nineteen ninety six 

353.44 354.24 A: (( [noise] )) 

359.24 372.57 B: and [mn] uh we always tried to pay more than minimum wage but this was probably we paid the minimum wage to general laborers because that's all that's all the companies that we had would be willing to pay 

363.92 366.22 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

367.67 368.83 A: (( [noise] [noise] right [noise] )) 

372.58 383.05 B: and as an employer you'd have to absorb certain costs you had to match the taxes that are paid you have to pay for workers' compensation and insurance and this that and the other so 

381.35 382.13 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

383.24 384.52 B: (( uh [mn] )) 

387.10 400.45 B: anyway i can see both sides of the fence but we were dealing primarily with unskilled uneducated laborers for the industrial part and as far as any clerical or administrative positions 

387.22 388.02 A: okay 

389.42 390.85 A: (( [noise] )) 

400.62 407.17 B: uh we couldn't find anybody to work for minimum wage and we would not ask them to do that independent of their skill level 

400.80 401.59 A: [noise] 

406.96 414.82 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [mn] [noise] [noise] yeah i think you you can take advantage of people by doing that 

407.92 408.84 B: so 

413.85 414.86 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

415.51 416.63 A: (( [noise] um )) 

418.18 425.81 A: [laughter] why are they giving us hard subjects [laughter] what were your previous subjects [noise] that you had to talk about before 

421.70 423.31 B: [noise] [laughter] 

426.30 428.01 B: (( uh yourself )) 

428.88 433.09 B: your what do you look for in a mate in a lifetime mate 

432.44 434.03 A: [noise] i got that one 

434.00 436.70 B: yeah that was good that was a good one 

436.71 438.30 A: yeah 

437.02 439.91 B: and um if i had 

440.40 443.22 B: [mn] going back to the minimum wage issue 

443.35 457.70 B: even if both partners were working at minimum wage at five fifteen an hour that would still the cost of living here in the state of alabama we would still ha- we couldn't get by 

443.56 444.35 A: uh-huh 

454.92 456.08 A: (( [noise] )) 

458.21 469.59 B: i mean there's no way [mn] and at five fifteen an hour if you make five if you're working for minimum wage you're not entitled to any government benefits whatsoever so it's like 

467.61 469.02 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] )) 

469.87 472.14 B: keeps you at a poverty low 

472.36 474.01 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] oh really ))
