4.00 5.42 A: nice to meet you 

7.73 11.73 A: okay this is my second call so [laughter] 

11.59 14.38 B: this is mine too isn't it supposed to tell us that it's recording 

14.76 17.58 A: um i think it started after the beep 

17.58 20.11 B: okay what do you think about minimum wage 

20.06 26.78 A: ah i think it's too low actually i didn't know what it was until i just heard her say five fifteen an hour 

27.52 29.15 B: right [noise] 

29.73 35.83 B: i agree with you i think it is much too low i think that to be able to provide for yourself 

36.65 37.78 B: you need more 

38.12 45.69 A: yeah to live in today's world yeah maybe back in the eighties five fifteen would have been enough [laughter] [laughter] 

40.16 41.37 B: (( than that exactly )) 

43.44 46.45 B: [laughter] [laughter] that's true 

46.66 47.95 A: [mn] but 

47.02 49.15 B: i don't know i think that 

49.86 54.35 B: i i mean i'll have to be honest i haven't worked for minimum wage for a long time 

55.29 62.40 B: so it's not something that you know like i like i s- i was with you i thought it was five twenty five an hour not five fifteen 

62.39 69.59 A: yeah i've i well actually yeah i thought it was like five i knew it was five something i didn't know 

70.20 73.25 A: i thought maybe like maybe just five 

74.05 79.07 A: but in to make it today i mean especially like if you're a single person 

79.29 84.31 A: trying to raise a family that's that's not going to work 

84.11 85.31 B: exactly 

85.55 90.79 B: exactly i think though even as far as um like when you go from like a 

86.63 87.34 A: it 

91.95 97.07 B: like when you move to a metropolis normally the wages are higher too and i don't agree with that either 

96.82 98.64 A: yeah 

98.15 103.33 B: ju- just because you live in a smaller town doesn't mean that your living expenses are any less 

103.09 105.27 A: right exactly 

105.89 107.50 A: exactly 

105.89 106.79 B: (( and )) 

107.56 110.86 B: and i think that i think that that's a really sad like 

110.87 116.58 B: for example i um just moved to a large city about six months ago 

116.90 123.99 B: and the walmart from the small town where i was from paid like six dollars an hour the walmarts in the city i live in pay like eight or nine to start 

123.33 124.77 A: oh wow 

124.43 126.31 B: there's a large difference [noise] 

126.12 131.13 A: oh well that's not man i wonder why that is i mean it i mean 

131.16 139.01 A: your rent your utilities your your your food everything's going to be the same whether you live in the city or the country so 

138.78 139.86 B: (( [noise] exactly )) 

139.52 153.84 A: i wonder why they do that that [sigh] wow ouch ouch for people that you know live in the country and start working and get this do the same thing people in the city do for the s- lower price 

153.22 159.51 B: exactly well i mean and i think it's just i don't know i think it's really hard to there's so many 

160.19 163.42 B: things that define minimum wage that 

162.57 163.80 A: right 

163.77 168.42 B: you know yes there's a minimum wage but could you make it in 

168.56 170.64 B: california on five fifteen 

170.90 174.89 B: could you make it in texas on five fifteen you know every place has a different 

175.99 177.00 B: (( you know )) 

176.55 179.33 A: right exactly 

177.87 181.56 B: it it's more expensive to live certain places than other places 

181.27 189.34 A: yeah like like up north oh my gosh um michigan five fifteen an hour [mn] or five twenty five just won't [mn] 

189.64 192.38 A: i don't i don't see how that can 

193.43 194.79 B: right [noise] 

193.48 195.46 A: how that can do it there 

196.91 203.07 B: right i mean i i don't know i live i guess i live in a pretty reasonable to live i live in arizona 

202.86 204.20 A: (( oh wow )) 

203.51 210.31 B: and pretty much from what i've heard we've got some of the cheapest living expenses there are but still i don't know how 

210.64 213.54 B: i mean i've got a husband and two kids 

213.68 217.08 B: if we were both making minimum wage there would there's no way 

216.88 218.58 A: right 

217.49 220.27 B: we would have the ability to support ourselves on that 

220.08 226.75 A: right exactly i mean i have a husband and two children also and we live in texas 

226.91 232.25 A: in right by austin and uh we live out in the country though so 

232.71 234.39 A: i guess you know 

235.21 242.09 A: if i ever go looking for minimum wage work i better go to the city [laughter] instead of out here in the country 

239.78 241.69 B: [laughter] 

242.43 245.46 B: i mean i just think that that's so discriminatory 

242.55 243.57 A: oh 

244.84 248.31 A: um oh it it is oh i didn't even i mean 

248.55 251.06 A: i wouldn't have thought i would have thought you know 

251.19 254.71 A: that you know they start you out the same everywhere 

255.15 255.90 B: no 

255.87 257.29 A: wow 

256.30 261.38 B: and and and i really i mean five fifteen an hour once you pay your taxes 

261.94 264.32 B: and god forbid you need health insurance 

264.02 269.90 A: [laughter] yeah yeah they're they're ouch everything i mean your your 

265.57 267.00 B: and daycare 

267.20 268.27 B: you're looking at 

270.30 280.45 A: [mn] for minimum wage if you if you are doing daycare and and taxes and and and all this well you're working to pay for all that you're not working to get anything home 

278.67 279.90 B: exactly 

280.41 288.57 B: exactly and don't i mean i guess to a point i feel like if minimum wage was higher there would be less issues with people on you know 

288.25 289.45 A: yeah 

289.11 291.29 B: federal assistance and state assistance 

290.84 294.50 A: right exactly heck yeah 

292.41 300.66 B: but you've got people who have kids who are a sole provider and it's like you said once you've paid your daycare and you've paid everything else 

300.77 304.96 B: you have nothing to live on so why not stay at home be with your kids 

305.98 307.85 A: right and 

306.31 311.45 B: and be on state assistance you know you're going to make almost the same amount of money 

311.10 313.36 A: right exactly 

312.14 314.11 B: and be with your family 

314.44 315.53 B: so i think it's 

314.55 324.27 A: and and and and have extra little different helps here and there and in- insurance and i don't know i don't know if they pay your bills or not but i mean 

325.01 326.45 B: [noise] i mean 

325.42 326.62 A: you know 

326.46 329.24 B: yeah so i think that if they were to 

329.26 334.34 B: you know raise the standards just a little bit higher [laughter] 

334.38 337.66 A: in order for people to be able to actually 

334.55 336.25 B: (( you know and there would be more )) 

337.67 344.61 A: pay their stuff and then breathe also or you know instead of just you know skimming by barely 

345.02 348.64 B: exactly i think it would just make people more self sufficient 

348.27 350.02 A: yeah 

349.31 360.36 B: and that's what you know that's what everybody says that we're trying to reform to is that people can be self sufficient and people don't be have to be on you know assistance and and then you have it to where they're not making anything 

361.42 362.86 B: (( so what do you expect )) 

362.50 363.81 A: right 

365.63 366.74 B: you know and 

367.00 373.88 B: i i don't know i mean i guess to a point i haven't seen any places that have s- that actually start people out at minimum wage anymore 

374.47 376.09 B: generally it's higher 

376.81 377.78 B: but 

378.53 379.91 B: i i don't know 

381.14 393.10 A: i don't know i i actually i'm a stay at home mom my husband he does he builds cellular phone towers so he makes good money so we can uh you know be a stay at home 

394.18 408.79 A: part family but i i the last i ever worked was in ninety five and that was a waitress so the minimum wage for us was like two thirty five [laughter] so that was kinda 

403.84 405.00 B: thirteen 

405.23 406.21 B: yeah 

406.44 407.63 B: yeah but 

408.75 411.27 A: yeah [laughter] 

409.76 413.28 B: i'm in the same predicament because my husband is actually a truck driver 

412.94 414.34 A: oh wow 

413.55 416.37 B: so i stay at home with the kids and 

416.45 423.36 B: you know and he has the ability to support us but and if i do work a job i normally work as a waitress which is two thirteen an hour 

423.42 425.00 B: but you have your tips 

425.62 427.91 B: which generally compensates 

427.63 428.85 A: uh-huh 

428.48 433.70 B: you know i've never even with tips made five fifteen an hour [laughter] so 

434.29 437.20 B: i mean i i don't know i wouldn't 

437.32 442.37 B: if if something were to change and i were to have to work a minimum wage job my kids and i could never make it 

442.20 445.39 A: oh yeah i know what you mean i i mean like 

445.58 450.84 A: oh god no i mean that's what forty bucks a day for eight hours 

447.46 448.35 B: i mean 

450.27 452.19 B: exactly exactly 

451.13 457.53 A: oh no way uh or or not even that because once like you said once taxes are taken out of that and your 

457.31 466.96 A: state and federaling tax and and your medicare and social security and all that well you're looking at what maybe four fifteen an hour 

466.88 468.91 B: exactly exactly 

469.03 470.15 A: and then 

469.31 470.15 B: (( you know a- )) 

470.36 473.32 A: on that a week what 

473.21 485.59 A: two hundred sixty bucks or something or not even that and that's going to pay your rent your car payment your electric your phone your you know food 

486.26 489.10 A: (( [sigh] that that's [laughter] )) 

486.64 488.55 B: exactly i mean 

489.20 493.87 B: maybe my kids have too high of a quality of life but that wouldn't even provide their clothes 

494.11 496.31 A: right exactly 

494.91 495.94 B: you know 

496.62 506.46 A: i i mean i can't see it doing food for four for a family of four [mn] i mean a week i i mean at least i'm saying a hundred dollars a week 

496.84 497.78 B: and then 

506.75 512.18 A: you know so how i mean and then that wow 

512.24 520.75 B: yeah and then you know like you want your kids to be involved in things but how do you pay the fees for little league or the fees for cheerleading or you know 

519.86 531.30 A: yes soccer and dance and all them goodies that come with school that everybody's doing and [sigh] if you're on minimum wage that ain't happening 

527.92 530.21 B: you don't want your kids to be left out 

531.26 537.54 B: right and the thing is is that they can't learn to participate and have strong skills to be able to help them go to college 

537.68 541.77 B: they're going to be in the same predicament that i'm raising them in because i'm doing that 

540.43 542.20 A: exactly 

542.39 548.31 B: you know so i just think that as a whole if they were to raise it a little bit then everybody would learn to be a little more self sufficient 

549.03 551.38 A: right and 

549.94 551.15 B: (( [lipsmack] you know )) 

551.79 555.59 B: or you nowadays you see so many families that it's you know 

555.93 562.25 B: a grandparent living with mom and dad or an aunt or an uncle to help pay those expenses 

563.44 566.00 B: and i think that really affects 

563.51 564.29 A: (( [sigh] or )) 

566.12 567.12 B: you know 

567.20 575.96 B: your kids' understanding that yes i'm going to grow up and i'm going to go to college or i'm going to be trained in a skilled profession to where i don't have to live like this 

575.52 578.65 A: yeah yeah [noise] 

579.16 583.59 B: so i think that i i don't know i have really strong opinions about a lot of 

583.38 584.68 A: [laughter] 

584.65 590.58 B: [laughter] just because i just don't think that it provides anything for anyone 

591.57 594.73 A: right except for maybe 

595.26 596.88 A: [laughter] like 

597.02 599.00 A: tax purposes and 

599.17 599.89 A: daycare
