0.16 3.62 B: hello my name's michelle and i'm in south carolina 

2.87 6.63 A: hi my name is terri and i'm in n- new jersey how are you 

6.27 8.09 B: oh i'm great and yourself 

7.72 11.80 A: i'm doing just good well what do you think about this minimum wage 

12.26 13.76 A: being five fifty 

12.32 13.36 B: well i 

13.63 19.35 B: i think it should have been more given you know the way the cost of living is now 

19.15 23.41 A: yes i agree um i believe that minimum wage 

23.56 34.57 A: i i would honestly think something more or less the lines of eight dollars an hour would be more sufficient because of the way that the economy is based on how people work 

32.21 33.14 B: right 

34.51 35.30 B: right 

34.54 41.33 A: um how much you make as to how much you earn as to how you're living you can't find an apartment 

35.44 36.47 B: [noise] 

41.36 50.69 A: in a decent area for less than five hundred dollars a month and a person making five fifty minimum wage clearly cannot afford that 

45.68 46.94 B: that's correct 

50.75 55.22 B: and then they make it so tough for you to get any kind of assistance 

54.94 59.79 A: right oh my gosh it's like they're like struggling for you to um i- 

60.25 67.01 A: it's like a struggle to even be on welfare then when they give you welfare welfare they give you absolutely nothing 

66.70 67.88 B: that's right 

67.58 71.82 A: and it's just like it's not a good situation especially for single parents 

71.55 72.86 B: that's correct 

72.89 78.82 A: when you have that one income coming in the house and all you have is a person making five fifty an hour 

79.08 81.06 A: that is not even clearly 

81.92 87.63 A: um sufficient to live off of especially especially for one person what if they have children 

87.48 97.90 B: [noise] not only that i- even if you know they lost their job and were reduced to okay you go get a minimum wage job to work 

97.37 98.36 A: mhm 

97.95 103.63 B: and then you're still expected to pay your bills on time that you had when you had the other income 

103.62 113.67 B: and sufficiently provide for your family or what have you or or even say it was two incomes and a person lost their job and you're on a five fifteen 

113.76 118.30 B: income or five fifty income there's no way that 

118.37 122.31 B: you can sufficiently support yourself nor your family 

121.72 129.22 A: no because i have been in that situation as an unemployed person being recently unemployed laid off from my job 

128.73 129.67 B: right 

129.07 142.45 A: there is no way in the world that i can take anything less than i was making before because i've i'm accustomed to living in that way number one number two the economy is not gonna allow me to take less than that 

142.17 143.16 B: right 

142.53 145.68 A: and for the simple fact that um 

145.99 153.58 A: y- you there is nothing really you can get for you you can't earn anything you have to be able to earn sufficient 

154.15 157.07 A: wages to even maintain the standard of living 

157.45 158.42 B: and if you're 

157.58 159.43 A: it it's just ridiculous 

159.09 160.23 B: that's right 

160.42 167.96 B: and if you don't you know there goes your credit you can't get the house you can't move from where you are 

167.50 171.39 A: and your bill collectors do not understand if you don't have a job [laughter] 

170.61 171.80 B: that's right 

171.70 176.12 A: nor do they understand you're only making minimum wage they don't care they just want their money 

176.13 188.50 B: i had one to tell me one time when i lost mine she she said well you need to work two or three jobs do what it takes to make your living and i told her i said ma'am i'm killing myself for you nor anyone else 

188.49 190.42 A: oh absolutely not 

189.79 191.07 B: yeah 

191.17 202.31 B: and she just you know she's like well you made the bill we're we're gonna to take you to court i said well let's go i said i'll tell the judge the same thing the same thing that i told you 

202.93 210.56 A: [mn] they have to be kidding us i mean it's just like it's so incredibly hard and i have five children 

204.82 205.84 B: yeah 

210.22 211.36 B: oh my 

210.85 215.67 A: and to even try to stretch out what five what minimum wage would be 

215.81 217.20 B: you wouldn't make it 

216.07 218.05 A: to accommodate all of them 

218.18 226.58 A: i wouldn't make it and like i said as a single parent there is no way in the world that you can honestly 

218.23 220.29 B: n- no you wouldn't 

227.14 235.00 A: and and in good clear faith do anything i mean and then like even when you try to get reduced lunch or something like that for your kids 

234.39 235.66 B: they won't give it 

235.03 236.59 A: they won't give it to you 

236.24 237.50 B: that's right 

236.88 245.79 A: and lunch school lunch is ridiculous i mean on top of all the bills that you have to pay try buying groceries for five people 

245.57 246.61 B: that's right 

246.07 247.54 A: (( on a minimum wage )) 

247.26 249.26 B: that's right you can't do it [mn] 

247.72 248.57 A: [laughter] 

248.59 255.84 A: i would never ever be able to do it i would never ever have anything if if i just received a minimum wage 

255.54 256.76 B: that's right 

256.76 267.68 A: and then if you get minimum wage and you get another job and you're collecting the unemployment they wanna cut your unemployment because [laughter] you're getting some money just the minimum wage it's not even worth it 

262.25 263.37 B: that's right 

267.06 270.12 B: and not to mention they wanna go up on your rent 

270.72 274.41 B: say you're making this amount of money you know you can afford more 

274.47 276.22 A: and you can't [laughter] 

275.37 277.66 B: you can't you really can't 

276.44 281.14 A: you can't it's like i wonder what type of um system they go to 

281.08 291.72 A: determine what they feel as though the minimum wage is it seems to be like it should be like a minimum wage maybe what they should do is there should be a minimum wage for 

291.68 304.90 A: um children like kids when they first started working that don't have children but if you have you're an adult and you are providing for a family then it seems to me as though there should be a minimum wage 

296.91 297.81 B: right 

304.81 307.11 A: based upon your status 

308.01 310.25 B: that's right yeah yeah 

308.03 321.48 A: you know what i'm saying so like if i had kids then i have five kids so my minimum wage you you shouldn't pay me least the least you should pay me is ten dollars an hour because of my my economic situation 

320.99 322.07 B: that's right 

322.41 323.73 A: and 

323.93 330.84 A: i don't think they look at different areas when they do minimum wage like i'm formerly from chicago 

330.45 331.37 B: okay 

331.18 343.72 A: chicago has a very high cost of living there is no way in the world that a person can get a decent apartment or a decent home in chicago and pay less than seven hundred dollars a month 

342.95 343.89 B: mhm 

343.57 352.13 A: new jersey has a very high standard of living not to mention the fact that insurance is ridiculous here so paying 

349.87 350.68 B: mm 

352.23 357.60 A: minimum wage you can't ev- a a average person can't even afford car insurance 

357.48 358.63 B: oh my 

358.89 361.10 A: so it it's like 

361.21 366.78 A: y- you're just doomed regardless you you don't know what you're gonna do you're stuck you're right in the middle 

367.32 378.81 B: well i know here working with employment statistics and well i don't do the wages but i see the wages that come in there's such a big disparity between the wages of people 

373.96 375.24 A: mhm 

378.92 382.46 B: and you know you can't just say 

382.49 387.51 B: pick 'em out and say okay because this person works in a factory this is what they need to be paid 

387.12 388.45 A: right 

387.85 391.07 B: you can't do that and i think that's a lot of what goes on 

390.76 393.90 A: oh i think too i think that minimum wage 

393.74 401.04 A: if i i if i'm correct in my history i think minimum wage started back when there were coal mines and factories 

400.02 400.88 B: right 

400.81 413.28 A: and they had to pay the factories a a fair price so what they did was they made the factory workers you know have this thing called this is the minimum wage that you can earn and it's like it's never been modified 

413.21 417.21 A: no one's done never done anything with it to change it 

416.92 418.06 B: that's right 

417.77 421.73 A: and it's just like we have just maintained the standard regardless 

422.38 425.71 B: and then you still have people out there that abuse the system 

426.33 437.76 A: uh oh gosh yeah i could i i i swear to you i could never afford if if i didn't have my fiance i i couldn't afford anything on my own 

437.80 439.10 B: (( i understand that )) 

437.81 441.95 A: i couldn't afford my mortgage i couldn't afford my car no or anything 

441.54 442.75 B: that's it mm 

442.02 444.65 A: it's like you you can't even get on the bus 

445.29 455.57 A: without having to pay an astronomical amount of money having to go to like philadelphia to work because they have city wage tax you gotta give four percent of that anyway 

455.66 465.63 A: then they turn around and then they just get minimum wage try giving four percent of your earnings from working in philadelphia and you're only making five fifty an hour 

465.95 468.73 B: that w- uh you wouldn't make it no 

467.82 476.03 A: you would not make it then to pay to br- bridge tolls and all those other things i- it's just 

469.55 470.40 B: no 

476.30 483.60 A: i mean i think they need to really look at the area that individuals live in each state should have their own state minimum wage 

483.20 485.04 B: that's right 

484.31 487.09 A: and i think that would solve a lot of the problem too 

487.32 498.44 B: and i think all of this like foreign aid and everything like that it needs to be cut out a oh yeah 'cause money is needed more so here in the u._s. 'cause that's where our money is going 

497.89 506.90 A: exactly we're sitting here paying for the rebuilding of iraq and we have people here who can't afford anything because we're paying 'em five fif- 

506.98 508.40 A: minimum wage 

508.11 509.20 B: that's right 

508.58 512.70 A: to do anything you you can't you know we're we're concerned about re- 

512.54 525.44 A: rebuilding iraq well i personally am not concerned about rebuilding iraq i'm concerned about people maintaining a standard of living in the united states and it doesn't seem to me as though we do that it seems as though we um 

520.46 521.57 B: that's right 

526.15 533.69 A: you know we just the it's just pitiful i i- it's just like you're speechless it's like you don't know what to say in regards to it 

533.35 544.82 B: and it it doesn't matter if you write your councilman or who's in office because they're going to do what they want to anyway you're just one voice crying out and saying okay this needs to be changed 

539.81 541.10 A: exactly 

542.16 543.69 A: exactly 

544.14 550.35 A: because i know for a fact that i have said something uh in regards to minimum wage before to my councilman 

550.12 551.07 B: mhm 

550.35 559.33 A: and my um state representative and nothing's ever been done it's it's like i don't even i'll never even receive a response back from it so it's like why 

559.50 561.76 A: are you asking me to do that 

561.00 562.24 B: that's right 

562.13 564.36 A: why are you asking me to 

565.09 572.02 A: to call in if you're not going to take into consideration what i've said as well as what hundreds of others have said 

572.17 576.96 A: it's like you they get you they they promise you these promises and they get in office 

576.76 591.11 A: and they don't do anything but what they wanna do and the minimum wage is definitely not one of th- the topics that i think is of importance right now i don't think anyone's concerned with it they're concerned with keeping the unemployment down which is going up and up 

586.55 587.76 B: a- that's right 

591.10 599.89 A: and the poverty level is is just rising every every every year when you do your taxes you know 

598.20 599.39 B: that's it
