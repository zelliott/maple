0.24 1.35 B: hello 

0.94 2.29 A: hi 

1.91 4.99 B: [sigh] hi [sigh] um my name's michelle 

4.79 6.27 A: my name's wade 

6.02 7.77 B: [sigh] hi can you hear me okay 

7.42 9.07 A: i can hear you just fine 

7.89 11.02 B: [sigh] okay i was cutting out a little bit before [sigh] [sigh] 

10.37 11.52 A: oh okay 

11.37 14.92 B: um okay so i guess we have a topic of the day huh [sigh] 

14.32 16.49 A: we do the minimum wage 

15.01 15.62 B: (( [sigh] )) 

16.74 21.96 B: um actually yeah i haven't really thought of that at all that [laughter] much 

17.77 20.14 A: [sigh] what do you think about the minimum wage 

21.33 23.13 A: well now you have a chance to 

22.78 27.83 B: [sigh] i know i know it was a much bigger deal when i was in high school and worrying about it 

27.29 28.60 A: [laughter] 

28.65 31.69 B: um i don't know do you have any thoughts on it 

31.37 35.26 A: [sigh] well the minimum wage in this country is relatively low 

35.25 50.09 A: in my opinion given the [sigh] [cough] given the um [lipsmack] given the cost of living in in certain places and [lipsmack] it seems to me that even raising it to [sigh] i think wh- what did they say five oh five five twenty five i 

42.20 42.97 B: mhm 

48.32 50.70 B: uh five fifteen i think 

50.00 58.45 A: don't think it really represents a a living wage especially since most of those jobs don't necessarily provide health care or insurance of any kind [sigh] 

58.33 67.30 B: yeah yeah that's actually what popped into my mind as well is that [sigh] in this country because so many people are uninsured that it's not really going to cover it 

58.48 60.27 A: um do 

67.16 76.09 A: [lipsmack] yeah it's it's um well it's it's worse because they don't actually get coverage for the most part with with a minimum wage job [sigh] [lipsmack] 

75.31 76.71 B: exactly 

76.44 80.77 A: and you know i suspect that [cough] a lot of people will 

81.27 91.54 A: [lipsmack] uh essentially be working uh you know somewhat part time so as to [sigh] avoid having f- well their so their employers can avoid having to pay their coverage 

91.16 92.56 B: (( yeah )) 

91.55 97.55 A: so it's it's in my mind not not a particularly [sigh] big boost 

96.63 107.47 B: yeah and because it it's interesting though that it is it's a federal minimum wage right and the states don't necessarily [sigh] uh do states actually ever have have a when a minimum wages differs that you know 

106.62 112.19 A: [noise] sure states can have higher minimum wage um but the federal minimum wage is a bare minimum rate 

108.42 111.02 B: yeah uh i don't think 

111.46 121.71 B: exactly and and so [sigh] i don't think that that like you mentioned that there are different uh cost of living in different in different parts of the country and that uh 

119.99 120.85 A: (( [mn] [mn] [mn] )) 

121.80 128.95 B: just definitely doesn't take into account for certain cities you know thinking about new york or [sigh] or l._a. or boston [sigh] 

128.81 139.79 B: um but i mean i suppose any increase is [sigh] is at least a step in the right direction and i think that people are thinking about problems and and the need for for keeping up i suppose [sigh] 

139.14 141.03 A: (( [noise] do you think it needs to be higher )) 

140.96 147.68 B: [lipsmack] yeah i would say it needs to be a little bit higher but um i don't know that i'd go to any extremes i mean i can see the 

147.48 160.34 B: i can see the cause for concern of businesses who you know small businesses which are struggling [sigh] um and you know need some part time help here or there [sigh] um this could this could impact their business so 

159.73 161.12 A: (( [sigh] mhm )) 

160.39 170.62 B: um this is something i would definitely need [laughter] to think about a little more because i'm i'm not [sigh] really in the position to [sigh] you know decide with either camp at this point [sigh] 

170.14 173.89 A: [sigh] mhm well [sigh] i suspect what will 

171.26 172.17 B: but 

174.38 182.07 A: what will happen is you know there's a there's a huge divide between rural and urban [sigh] in terms of in terms of cost of living 

178.97 179.74 B: (( mm )) 

182.20 191.77 A: [sigh] so what i would suspect would happen is that you know for certain states where the cost of living is inherently higher because maybe they have more urban populations [sigh] 

191.72 200.58 A: that they would they would set their own minimum wage higher i know california used to do that um i suspect massachusetts probably does something like that [sigh] 

195.98 197.18 B: (( [sigh] yeah )) 

200.66 210.15 A: and it it would make s- it would make more sense in that direction i think the federal minimum wage though is so low that i- it would probably be hard for people who [sigh] 

210.24 215.65 A: even living in rural environments uh to to really be able to live off of it [sigh] 

215.37 217.55 B: yep that's true [sigh] 

215.99 216.94 A: so 

217.64 218.56 A: (( i don't know )) 

218.56 233.32 B: we'll see uh [sigh] we'll see what comes i guess there have been enough other problems in in this country that people haven't really [sigh] um taken a stand i suppose i haven't heard of too many uh outcries about this particular uh issue right now 

232.47 233.92 A: no no 

233.73 236.77 B: so uh we'll see what happens with that [sigh] 

236.96 237.93 B: um 

237.95 239.63 B: [lipsmack] anyway [laughter] 

240.49 248.97 A: well [lipsmack] um so do you think that for instance uh [mn] what do you think a a uh living wage ought to be in this country 

248.68 250.37 B: wow um 

251.14 253.46 A: well what should it be enough to cover [mn] [mn] 

251.18 251.75 B: (( [lipsmack] )) 

253.03 256.47 B: yeah let's see [sigh] i mean i guess 

257.38 261.46 B: i guess if you're thinking about a job that definitely that doesn't have 

261.89 263.55 B: have benefits 

263.85 267.83 B: then you have to think about somebody who who needs to cover that on their own 

267.46 268.33 A: (( mhm [sigh] [noise] )) 

268.17 276.61 B: and take that into account and so if you're thinking about [lipsmack] uh an- and then again these minimum wage jobs 

276.70 280.19 B: probably aren't going to necessarily be be be full time 

280.46 285.53 B: so i have to sit down and think about it i mean if you think about it you know thirty forty hours a week 

285.64 287.49 B: [sigh] needing to cover 

287.95 290.46 B: cover expenses i mean [sigh] 

290.81 295.08 B: you know you'd w- you'd want to make sure that the calculation comes out to you know 

295.31 296.83 A: would you want them to be able to 

295.46 300.66 B: twenty to thirty thousand depending on where they live in the country i suppose as a at a minimum 

300.36 302.27 A: would you want them to be able to [sigh] 

301.29 301.85 B: (( so )) 

302.22 315.56 A: uh to for instance save for retirement or do you think that basically people earning the the low end of the minimum wage spectrum should be considering other alternatives for retirement like a career change 

306.35 307.72 B: [lipsmack] 

315.50 329.72 B: yeah um i don't [sigh] honestly i don't think that's that that is something that the minimum wage can take into account i mean the minimum wage is supposed to be a floor to safeguard people who hopefully 

330.19 334.80 B: you know i mean not not everyone who is working at minimum wage is 

334.92 339.09 B: is doing it for the rest of their life right and so 

335.59 348.53 A: right so that's a bigger question right so sh- what should it cover in in in terms of what is the bare minimum [sigh] that the minimum wage is attempting to cover in other countries the bare minimum wage is meant to cover [sigh] 

348.66 351.25 A: you know basically the ability to live 

350.27 351.94 B: (( [sigh] r- right )) 

351.34 356.46 A: um and some countries it's not even meant to cover that 

356.06 357.47 B: (( yeah )) 

356.68 369.03 A: um and in other countries it's you know designed to cover you know the the bare minimum that it would take for somebody to live and live [sigh] in such a way that they could retire and do f- you know whatever right [mn] 

368.33 375.60 B: yeah and unfortunately i don't think that we have the scope to do that well it might be nice [sigh] um i don't think that that's necessarily [sigh] 

375.48 383.84 B: the the purpose i think it is really just the [sigh] um you know lower floor to cover people who are either [sigh] temporarily you know 

383.60 397.38 B: working a job that that you know that has to that pays minimum wage [sigh] um or if you're thinking about you know younger kind of trends that have [sigh] um transition workers you know um and it is unfortunate for 

394.77 396.43 A: (( mhm )) 

397.62 402.82 B: i guess for people who who are working minimum wage jobs for a living i guess er 

403.02 408.32 B: something else has to be done but that's why we've got social security as well you know 

408.95 414.89 A: mhm so do you think minimum wage workers should be taxed at the same rate that 

408.96 409.87 B: so 

410.32 411.58 B: (( [lipsmack] um )) 

414.95 417.61 A: that uh that richer people are 

416.94 419.05 B: no actually i don't 

419.15 426.12 B: um but i think that again it's another it's another safeguard so that there there is something being 

426.18 429.78 B: being put away um so that 

429.89 436.32 B: there is income later in life but i i do not believe that they should be taxed at the same rate 

433.45 434.12 A: (( [mn] [sigh] )) 

436.58 442.06 A: well because currently social security is taxed as a fixed rate across for all people right 

436.99 437.76 B: (( right )) 

439.57 440.62 B: (( yeah i know )) 

440.87 447.81 B: i know [sigh] but that would be a whole separate [laughter] issue i suppose of litigation [sigh] um but uh yeah i mean 

443.55 444.67 A: (( [laughter] [noise] )) 

448.56 453.56 B: i i personally don't belie- believe that it's fair but it's things like that that take 

453.69 457.66 B: a long time to change [sigh] um [lipsmack] 

458.32 462.15 B: but i mean i think that having 

462.50 464.22 B: a minimum wage 

464.84 477.15 B: you know it's a s- like i said it before i think it's a step in the right direction because you're addressing you're realizing that there is a problem and that there needs to be some safeguard for [sigh] people out there um you know and having programmes 

477.21 487.21 B: like you know welfare and social security and [sigh] making sure those programmes are in place just in case and then giving people the opportunity [sigh] um 

487.38 491.37 B: to move above and beyond that you know whether it's [sigh] 

491.43 494.03 B: um you know scholarships or 

493.90 495.22 A: (( [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [mn] )) 

494.09 501.35 B: um head start programmes for kids and and things like that [sigh] but um other social programmes that can help people 

498.53 499.67 A: (( mhm [noise] )) 

502.23 503.25 B: um 

503.32 506.90 B: move into something else if if they choose to [sigh] [lipsmack] 

506.13 508.03 A: (( [noise] mhm [noise] )) 

507.72 510.39 B: they just take advantage of it so [lipsmack] 

510.62 520.82 B: [sigh] yeah i guess it's [laughter] interesting that this is the topic i mean i end up paying more attention to it i'll have to go and uh [sigh] see what what's out there it just hasn't been on my radar screen 

521.28 526.31 A: well yeah i mean i don't think it's on a lot of people's radar screens screens these days 

524.76 525.68 B: yeah 

526.11 527.69 B: yep 

526.94 527.80 A: (( at all )) 

528.19 529.01 B: (( well )) 

529.07 530.65 B: [lipsmack] we'll see what comes of it 

531.48 532.93 A: (( [noise] mhm [mn] )) 

533.57 537.80 A: [noise] so what do you think the uh current administration's policy is on all of this 

538.49 540.84 A: [mn] how do you think they feel about the minimum wage 

541.48 542.97 B: (( [mn] [mn] [noise] [lipsmack] um )) 

543.36 544.35 B: hm 

545.45 546.86 A: if you had to guess 

546.03 549.38 B: [lipsmack] yeah i mean i would say that 

549.87 559.93 B: they would they would probably argue to increase it in order at this point you know saying that they er that it would spread the economy thinking that [sigh] this is 

558.83 560.72 A: [noise] from a growth perspective 

560.01 572.94 B: yeah that this would somehow give people more spending capacity which [sigh] you know along along the arguments you know what we've been discussing as far as being able to cover [sigh] minimum standards of living it's probably not true but 

572.94 575.10 B: that's probably an argument [sigh] 

574.42 578.11 A: [mn] [sigh] and how would how would they believe that that would impact business 

578.33 583.54 B: well if people then were able to spend more um 

581.98 585.93 A: [mn] [mn] no i mean in terms of the bottom line in terms of being able to pay 

585.98 594.06 B: oh right and that's that's what i mentioned before i mean if you think about [sigh] small businesses that are already struggling at this point this is just another burden on them 

586.59 587.84 A: their payrolls 

593.87 596.65 A: so right you have all these companies that are going out of business 

596.37 597.48 B: right 

596.69 599.89 A: and now they have to pay let's say ten percent more to everybody that
