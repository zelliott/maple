103.28 104.15 A: (( mm )) 

106.48 108.08 B: but i mean 

108.11 116.83 B: i can't imagine anybody i mean like i mean obviously california is pretty expensive too you know um 

115.26 116.25 A: uh-huh 

118.07 121.11 B: i i apparently can't spell minimum there we go 

120.05 127.15 A: when i was younger i mean i'm forty seven now and when i was younger in my twenties minimum wage was like 

122.09 122.96 B: uh-huh 

127.62 132.93 A: a dollar sixty eight an hour or something like that yeah if you can imagine 

129.81 131.40 B: really 

133.04 136.01 A: so um and then i think um 

136.70 140.82 A: right when i turned twenty one i think it went up to like 

141.46 151.75 A: almost two dollars an hour i remember that because i was i was working out at the union at the time and i was thinking to myself thank god i'm i'm working union you know 

151.49 153.02 B: right right 

152.39 154.38 A: 'cause i had better wages 

154.20 155.00 B: right 

155.02 156.70 A: yeah 

157.19 160.78 A: and it's been a long that's the last time i've ever even 

157.42 158.84 B: see because i mean 

161.72 169.69 A: you know made a wage close to minimum wage you know ah to the union i think i was making like four something an hour 

165.67 166.56 B: right 

169.51 170.70 B: mhm 

170.26 172.48 A: compared to you know minimum wage 

172.59 180.05 A: yeah that was quite a bit [laughter] i think back and i think oh my gosh [laughter] how did i get by [laughter] 

177.93 178.73 B: right 

179.26 180.10 B: right 

180.57 192.63 B: i mean it's crazy um i'm trying to think like when i got my first job i think i want to say like i was making five fifteen but that was you know ten years' ago 

181.89 183.02 A: uh-huh 

189.92 190.98 A: (( mhm )) 

192.91 194.09 B: you know but 

193.60 194.67 A: uh-huh 

194.26 197.05 B: i i don't know if that's correct or not now 

195.55 200.98 A: i think it could be close to five maybe five sixty five it think that's 

199.99 204.04 B: see that's the or- that sounds better you know that sounds closer 

202.32 203.70 A: yeah 

204.41 208.77 A: seems like i heard that somewhere it's five sixty five but then i could be wrong 

204.68 205.43 B: 'cause i 

207.26 208.74 B: (( i really had thought )) 

208.99 211.01 B: (( i really had thought it'd gone up )) 

209.21 211.02 A: ah how old are you 

211.06 212.57 B: i'm twenty six 

212.24 220.07 A: twenty six yeah so you you'd come more to knowing than i would [laughter] 'cause you're in the younger group yeah 

213.20 214.45 B: yeah 

217.21 218.20 B: right 

219.30 220.66 B: right 

220.15 226.18 A: i i haven't been in the work field per say i'm sort of semi out of the work field 

226.27 234.37 A: ah for a while now um i'm a stay at home not a stay at home mom but a stay at home wifie [laughter] yeah 

227.73 228.70 B: uh-huh 

232.53 233.65 B: right 

234.06 235.03 B: right 

234.41 235.77 A: so um 

236.71 243.55 A: i don't know um but that's interesting i'm glad that they brought that topic up 'cause i'm like you i really would like to know [laughter] 

243.54 251.60 B: right yeah i know i mean i really i can't imagine okay so it's like let's say you work a normal forty hour week which i mean 

251.55 260.59 B: probably if you're making minimum wage and not working a normal forty hour week 'cause it's usually a part time job but forty forty hours a week 

256.03 257.08 A: uh-huh 

258.20 259.15 A: uh-huh 

260.63 263.44 B: times what'd they say five fifteen 

264.28 265.23 A: mhm 

264.85 268.36 B: (( [mn] is let me see let me do the maths real quick )) 

270.04 272.10 B: (( is )) 

272.22 273.21 B: six 

273.97 275.16 B: ah 

275.22 285.81 B: oh what did i do it's two hundred and six dollars a week before taxes there is no way to live on that amount of money especially in new york 

278.48 279.36 A: uh-huh 

280.55 281.60 A: (( mhm )) 

282.89 283.82 A: (( uh-uh )) 

285.72 286.85 A: no 

285.93 289.57 B: you know what i mean like it's insanely expensive to live here 

287.92 293.79 A: that's way below ah what do you call it ah low low income i would think 

293.93 294.98 A: (( you know )) 

293.98 299.54 B: actually yeah i actually just heard this thing on the radio um somebody was talking about 

300.09 304.73 B: how i i didn't catch the whole thing but they were saying something about 

305.21 306.18 B: um 

306.74 311.11 B: whoever was saying that two hundred thousand dollars is being considered 

311.25 316.52 B: upper class if you make two hundred thousand dollars a year it's being considered upper class and you're getting 

315.87 318.83 A: i'd be floating on cloud nine [laughter] 

317.93 332.72 B: [laughter] and you're going to get taxed as an upper class and and this guy was saying he was like you know i don't think two hundred thousand dollars is upper class like i'd say it's upper middle you know but i don't i don't consider that rich you know 

321.58 322.65 A: uh-huh 

332.80 335.44 B: and i mean i don't know what do you think 

335.08 337.10 A: yeah i think it it 

337.35 339.31 A: to me that that that 

339.41 343.57 A: that seems more than upper upper class you know i mean 

343.65 347.14 A: um because that's a lot of money i mean you know 

347.14 348.12 B: right 

348.17 356.97 A: to me anyway i mean here in california um i i in the community i live in [laughter] um the 

349.31 350.13 B: right 

356.97 370.33 A: i live in farm farm area and the people that work here they they you know they make pretty good money because they have the farming industry union backing them up but ah 

359.60 360.65 B: (( oh okay )) 

370.54 377.27 A: even the men y- ah think i would do with the minimum wage because of that right there um but they 

374.41 375.85 B: [laughter] 

377.41 387.28 A: what you just mentioned would ev- even that amount they would ah they'd be floating on cloud nine making that kind of money even even if if working for the unions they do 

384.05 385.02 B: right 

387.32 388.36 B: uh-huh 

387.52 393.15 A: but that ah that definitely would be um could you get by in new york on that 

393.40 394.68 A: that kind of money 

393.98 395.80 B: (( on two hundred thousand yeah )) 

395.18 397.01 A: yeah oh yeah yeah 

396.39 397.77 B: (( yeah you can )) 

397.06 399.23 A: are are you is that a year or 

399.65 401.22 B: a year yeah 

400.42 406.11 A: yeah a year yeah gee that's that's up there [laughter] with no doubt 

402.08 402.98 B: yeah 

404.93 412.07 B: you know i mean i j- i just don't think it's so far off you know like to say well that's that's um 

408.89 409.78 A: (( mhm )) 

412.18 416.80 B: that's rich or that's that's upper class you know um at least 

415.08 416.07 A: (( mhm mhm )) 

416.91 421.72 B: i guess i mean i don't know how much do people typically make like let's say where you're from 

421.74 430.65 B: like actually let me just tell ya i was just in i live like in new york city so it's like i said things are very expensive you know you know such a high 

428.66 429.62 A: (( mhm mhm mm )) 

430.75 434.99 B: you know the rent and and just everything you know is insanely expensive 

435.14 435.89 A: mm 

435.46 446.79 B: i was down in pennsylvania um a couple of days ago for for something for work and i'd picked up the paper and i was looking at the homes down there and there are homes there 

447.38 459.96 B: for like seventy five eighty thousand a hundred thousand which to me blows my mind i was like there's no way like you cannot buy anything 

460.25 466.59 B: anything anywhere in like the crappiest part of like brooklyn or the bronx 

466.68 470.03 B: harlem anywhere you can't buy anything 

470.15 474.27 B: in new york city for less than two hundred grand 

474.26 483.06 A: oh my goodness that's about the way it is in the area that i live in here in california i live in one of the most expensive areas here in california 

474.38 477.36 B: and so and so for me to see 

479.95 480.68 B: right 

482.81 483.65 B: right 

483.32 484.56 A: and ah 

484.46 488.35 A: the house that i live in i'm just lucky to be able to live in it 

488.19 501.08 A: but um to buy a house or or you know or anything like it in this area you're looking at a- more than that you know even in like you say it in the crappiest area it's around three hundred grand 

488.20 489.26 B: (( uh-huh oh )) 

500.86 502.25 B: yeah sure 

502.02 503.07 A: (( yeah mhm )) 

502.36 510.85 B: so so then to say like wow they're you know like it's it really is it's almost relative on where you live that's why i even said 

510.68 524.44 B: is it is the minimum wage more because the minimum wage yes i understand you know like it's a standard and it's a base so that they can't pay you anything less but obviously the the um 

525.26 529.88 B: [mn] ah i can't think of the word that i'm trying to think of the 

530.02 530.69 B: the 

530.63 535.17 B: price of living the the the the the cost of living that's what i'm trying to think of 

533.99 535.76 A: cost of living yeah uh-huh 

535.07 550.03 B: the cost of living is obviously much higher in new york city than it is in like where i was in pennsylvania like i was in a relative not a small little town but you know a relatively kind of suburban town um and and they had houses for 

540.78 541.77 A: (( mhm )) 

547.33 548.38 A: yeah 

550.19 555.34 B: you know seventy five eighty thousand dollars a hundred thousand dollars and i'm thinking to myself 

555.43 567.43 B: wow i should like take the money that i make in new york and move [laughter] and and go and buy myself a house down there you know what i mean like because i can never afford to buy a house in new york ever 

562.95 563.93 A: (( mm uh-huh )) 

566.49 579.98 A: mm yeah you know h- hypothetically that you know the president is the one that sets the minimum wage and like you was asking is it per state that's probably what he should do is set the minimum wage per state and the cost of living 

571.95 572.87 B: right 

580.00 583.72 B: right which wouldn't that i think that that would make more sense you know 

580.69 581.34 A: (( mm )) 

583.01 584.53 A: yeah uh-huh 

584.61 593.12 A: i i would think it would too because at you know each state it costs so much to live in that state some states it costs more to live in 

593.13 599.36 A: compared to other states like i was talking to somebody the other day who was it i was talking to that said that it was really 

594.47 595.89 B: exactly 

599.41 599.89 A: (( b- ))
