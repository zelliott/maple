145.11 146.60 B: yeah so 

147.65 153.98 B: but the question was is it fair that it is five fifty or is it fair that they've raised it to five fifty 

148.64 149.50 A: (( [laughter] )) 

153.17 156.37 A: i guess it was is it fair that they raised it to five fifteen 

155.42 157.78 B: who's it's fair or 

157.74 169.70 B: [noise] the question is is it fair to who fair to the employers that they raise it to five fifty or fair 'cause i mean obviously it's fair to people making minimum wage 'cause they're making more [laughter] money but i mean is it [mn] 

162.17 164.55 A: they didn't specify any of it 

169.19 170.64 A: right of course it 

169.46 174.36 B: if the question is if the question is it fair that five fifty is minimum wage it's a different question 

172.80 173.83 A: of course 

173.94 178.94 A: of course but that wasn't the question the question was is it fair that they that they raised it to 

179.03 179.67 B: (( [mn] [noise] )) 

179.31 182.10 A: the wage of five fifteen 

183.20 186.73 B: [mn] yeah great we are kinda screwed 

184.16 188.50 A: so is it fair that they raised it yes it's fair that they raised it 

187.01 188.10 B: my uh 

188.62 193.71 B: my uh [mn] my friend did this and uh their question was like [noise] 

194.13 204.03 B: something about what do you look for in a in a mate or something like that in like what do you look for in a significant other or something like that that would have been a much cooler question 

197.77 198.77 A: (( in a what )) 

201.29 202.31 A: really 

203.71 205.63 A: [laughter] 

204.96 207.09 B: uh all right so 

206.75 207.50 A: (( [mn] )) 

207.68 208.60 B: (( [laughter] )) 

208.59 213.77 A: [laughter] i mean i guess we could pretend it's that one if you really want [laughter] 

209.12 210.06 B: (( ok- [mn] )) 

211.12 222.54 B: [laughter] [mn] okay so no but they want us to talk about [laughter] minimum wage [mn] i guess this is the whole the whole test is how do people talk about something that is boring to talk about 

222.81 223.80 A: yeah 

223.02 226.51 B: well no if somebody could be i mean so 

226.80 229.38 B: [laughter] i mean it's 

227.40 228.43 A: [laughter] 

229.56 232.25 B: it's fair [laughter] to uh 

231.73 242.57 A: yeah [mn] i think we both agree that it's fair to increase it but the actual number isn't fair although i would say that i know some people who are working in investment banking [mn] in new york city which is where i live 

235.70 238.15 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

240.24 242.02 B: yeah 

242.24 243.36 B: oh wow 

242.80 250.69 A: and they might make a lot of money like as a a- for their bonuses or their salary but when you breakdown how many hours 

249.24 251.66 B: their base salary is oh 

250.80 256.32 A: yeah 'cause they work like over a hundred hours a week so their base salary actually ends up being 

256.90 257.91 A: about 

258.38 259.73 A: minimum wage 

259.61 261.87 B: (( [noise] well that's )) 

260.17 261.93 A: which [mn] is an interesting 

262.07 262.91 B: different i

280.76 286.81 B: i don't i don't real- i'm not super knowledgeable about people who have to live off minimum wage or you know what i mean 

285.63 293.46 A: [mn] i'm not i i mean i come from the same background so i don't really know either i mean i i only know what i've like learned or read but it 

291.07 292.30 B: (( all i know is ))

346.25 351.67 A: it it's quite a like a wake up call after not having to worry about anything 

351.47 353.30 B: really 

351.85 363.66 A: now like working and yeah wanting to enjoy the city but knowing that things are so expensive i i quite frankly can't imagine how someone who lives on minimum wage or something 

357.52 359.62 B: yeah 

363.83 368.01 A: ex- exists in this city at all [mn] like even paying for transportation

382.62 385.23 A: (( [noise] so am i [laughter] )) 

386.77 388.09 A: [laughter] 

388.63 392.05 A: exactly [laughter] 

391.98 395.69 B: um yeah so minimum wage people can uh 

392.21 393.25 A: (( [mn] [noise] [laughter] )) 

395.78 399.04 B: [noise] sign up for this study [mn] and uh 

399.28 400.70 B: make money [laughter] this way 

400.34 401.01 A: (( ye- )) 

400.78 402.65 B: you know working in research right 

402.68 407.35 B: another way [mn] i make money is i [laughter] this sounds really gross but i donate bo- [laughter] 

407.97 412.58 B: don't think of it as bad when i say this i donate bodily fluids for money being blood and saliva 

412.73 413.99 A: and what else 

414.05 415.52 B: nothing else [laughter] 

414.72 416.42 A: (( [laughter] [mn] )) 

415.81 419.34 B: nothing at [laughter] all my friend used to donate 

419.20 431.69 B: what else and if what i think you're thinking is correct he used to donate that and like he needed to buy a computer for school [mn] and like we went to we went to go buy his computer for him and we picked him up from the place [laughter] where he got his check 

421.34 422.23 A: yeah 

426.41 427.25 A: (( [mn] )) 

431.62 435.56 B: to go buy his computer 'cause he needed to get some money [mn] all right anyways 

435.01 436.96 A: [laughter] [mn] are you joking 

435.58 441.28 B: no but i i'm not joking [laughter] no but i've d- i used to donate blood for ninety dollars a pint 

437.17 438.87 A: [laughter] 

441.29 442.30 A: wow 

441.94 449.23 B: yeah [mn] it's because they pay so much money is 'cause they get it from like the blood banks or patients they have to go through all this paperwork 

443.47 445.13 A: i'm surprised that you actually ge- 

448.74 449.60 A: uh-huh 

449.23 457.25 B: but to get it just from some random guy off the street like they have to just fill out one form [mn] and they offer them lots of money so i used to get ninety dollars a pint [noise] 

457.26 460.76 A: wow i didn't know that people actually offered money for that 

460.26 468.40 B: yeah well n- yeah you have to donate to the sciences though like they were going to infect my blood with aids or something i don't know but 

465.72 466.78 A: right 

467.48 471.33 A: i mean i'm not saying i would choose to all of a sudden you know 

472.15 477.45 A: donate more blood because i get paid for it but i was just surprised that that's a practice 

475.38 476.32 B: [laughter] 

477.19 485.92 B: yeah yeah [mn] but anyways [mn] uh [laughter] that could be [laughter] an option for people working minimum wage 

477.85 478.52 A: (( hm )) 

480.78 481.85 A: interesting 

484.83 487.95 A: [laughter] 

486.29 487.97 B: [laughter] 

488.17 496.36 B: [mn] um let's see what else is there five fifty i thought minimum wage was higher than five fifty maybe i was wrong [mn] 

489.48 490.04 A: (( [mn] )) 

490.26 492.23 A: yeah i guess that could be [laughter] 

495.71 499.78 A: i actually thought it was somewhere in the fives but i wasn't sure 

498.64 502.37 B: i thought it was like five seventy five or something but maybe i was just completely off 

502.18 505.41 A: [mn] well maybe that's part of the question to see whether or not we know 

506.34 512.07 B: [mn] [noise] what is this a linguistics study so then they're studying how we you know interact and how 

507.79 509.15 A: (( [laughter] i [laughter] )) 

512.67 516.03 B: [mn] [laughter] and you [mn] did you have the email thing it's just it's like

522.73 523.81 A: no 

523.75 524.62 B: (( [mn] no )) 

524.18 527.02 A: i didn't get that email maybe i just didn't look at it 

525.37 527.97 B: well well that's what they're
