419.46 420.93 B: [laughter] yeah

462.59 463.97 B: mhm 

463.32 467.94 A: so maybe it's just picking up more and more people 

467.85 470.34 B: (( mhm well that's good well hopefully ))

470.87 471.80 A: yeah 

473.98 479.51 A: it is something and yeah ten dollars for ten minutes it's certainly better than the minimum wage topic [laughter]

477.15 483.70 B: that's pretty good i know huh [laughter] i could do this for a whole hour i could get sixty dollars in an hour [laughter] yeah

504.88 505.85 A: (( the one with ))

511.68 514.39 B: (( mhm oh yeah that's pretty good )) 

515.43 516.19 B: (( [cough] oh )) 

518.07 519.49 A: (( yeah oh ))

562.20 565.77 B: yeah i guess after a while you do kinda get tired [laughter] 

566.24 572.21 A: yeah yeah i think it also depends i my experience in accounting had been that people are very very petty 

572.09 573.18 B: mhm 

573.10 583.08 A: and so all that stupid interpersonal crap that happens in corporate environment just seemed to be really amplified in accounting departments 

582.70 584.18 B: mhm 

583.95 585.59 A: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

585.96 599.89 A: i i would go to um seminars and i'd see people from like h._r. or other depart- or marketing and they were just much nicer much happier people i just think the industry really attracts um or that that field attracts a very small 

594.15 595.19 B: (( oh mhm ))
