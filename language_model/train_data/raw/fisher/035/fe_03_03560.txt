0.07 1.88 B: hi i'm cindy 

1.32 4.29 A: hi cindy my name is karen how are you 

4.10 5.55 B: okay and you 

5.09 8.48 A: oh very good thank you um i don't 

7.17 9.80 B: wh what's the topic mini um 

9.51 20.52 A: minimum wage i believe yeah and how you feel if you feel i believe it's i think i think they said it was going up to five dollars and fifteen cents per hour and whether or not you thought that that was sufficient 

10.34 11.65 B: minimum wage 

20.07 24.29 B: [sigh] y- i it it all depends on what state you live don't you think 

23.78 32.92 A: i think so too i think it's very relative um because it obviously the cost of living comes into play and uh so definitely um [sigh] uh i i think u- 

32.74 43.40 A: uh overall i know that i mean i wish obviously ideally everybody was just you know making some astronomical amount of money [laughter] if everyone could afford to but you know [laughter] 

39.72 41.14 B: exactly 

41.18 44.22 B: but it would never be enough so it doesn't matter [laughter] 

43.55 51.15 A: right right but um i but i was going to say i guess that really does when you're trying to think about it as a base wage and whether or not it um 

51.10 58.78 A: i- it is sufficient you know just to get by i it really does depend on where you're at some places are obviously so costly and you know i'm sure it 

58.62 66.55 A: m- trying to make five fifteen an hour and living in somewhere like new york or san francisco it would probably would not um i don't know what you would do [laughter] [noise] 

65.16 76.83 B: [mn] uh i don't know what i would do either because like it's like i make pretty reasonable money and it seems like it's just not enough and you know i and i'm single and i'm living i'm living at home with my parents and i feel like i don't save anything 

71.62 72.89 A: exactly well [noise] 

76.49 87.71 A: oh my goodness well i feel i'm the same but i'm actually i um [lipsmack] i actually i i live with my fiance but i have a little boy from i was married before and so there's the three of us in our household and my fiance and i both work fulltime 

83.65 84.54 B: mhm 

87.63 96.86 A: and uh it just you know and and we're actually um we're in an area that is not tremendously expensive to live and and real estate i guess is usually one of the the biggest things that 

96.86 111.24 A: kinda really crunches people [sigh] and um and it's you know fairly uh affordable here but it still seems like it's hard to get ahead and you kinda still continue to live paycheck to paycheck and don't g- really get a chance to put much aside you know [laughter] 

107.40 108.55 B: yeah 

110.19 112.19 B: yeah i know and where do you live 

111.60 115.28 A: i actually live in the panhandle of florida where are you cindy 

115.02 118.01 B: new york [laughter] [laughter] 

115.80 129.37 A: oh wow man that's so we're quite far away um actually my fiance was living in the city um uh he was in new york and he moved to down here and uh so a couple of years ago actually so it was a big change 'cause he's actually from here 

129.17 140.13 A: and this is our hometown so we moved back and uh it it's a it was you know he still though it's funny he thought he was going to save all this money coming back from new york and and it just you don't you know [laughter] 

138.09 148.52 B: you don't you well you know like i said the more money you make the more money you need and it's like even if you're s- even if like whatever something went down then he'll find another way to spend the money 

143.13 143.91 A: yeah 

148.12 149.85 A: exactly 

148.29 155.44 B: and you don't even realize it but you spent you're like oh yeah but my my rent went down three hundred dollars why don't i have those extra three hundred dollars a month 

155.19 168.66 A: no exactly but then you it's funny because then down here you know he didn't have to have a car there but then he gets down here and you really need a car to be able to get around and you know so there's always something that ends up eating up any kind of you know difference that you might have you know [laughter] 

161.29 162.96 B: yeah and f- 

167.53 170.75 B: yeah i know and in florida you can't live without a car 

170.17 175.84 A: no you really can't and we're kinda you know we're in a area where things are not it it's just kind of um 

175.68 188.33 A: [lipsmack] it's not necessarily it's not as dense or anything as like i- down you know around south florida but i- it's just you know in order to get around you have to have it there's really no public transportation that people generally rely on that something that's really easy that 

188.11 193.79 A: you know y- and you can't just walk around and get to places everywhere [laughter] [laughter] so are you in this 

190.94 192.46 B: no you can't 

192.50 197.43 B: you can't and god forbid your your car break down 'cause 'cause you can't get to work [laughter] [mn] but 

196.37 201.37 A: exactly exactly that it it is it's ha- it's hard so um but yeah now i um 

201.20 213.52 A: i i don't know i really when you know thinking about that as far as the five dollars and fifteen cents an hour i i really i would almost feel like oh my gosh why am i working in a certain sense because it seems like it would just turn around and go so much to taxes and 

213.38 218.18 A: it i you know i would almost like i i don't know what i would do [laughter] 

216.63 228.24 B: [mn] but but if you think about it most of the times when you're making minimum wage [lipsmack] you're either a young child so either you're like fresh out of high school or still in high school so that's okay 

220.71 221.37 A: mhm 

223.05 223.80 A: right 

226.41 227.51 A: right 

228.21 235.09 B: so any money you get is just play money and then like most of the times you're making minimum wage is because you're not making anything else 

230.78 231.81 A: right 

234.62 245.97 A: right that's true [sigh] and i guess too a lot of times if you are th- probably if you're living on minimum wage and you weren't in those situations you would probably be considered on a poverty level where you would qualify for different programs and things 

245.74 258.63 A: that would help to um enhance that you know where maybe you would be able to you know a first time home owners kind of thing for somebody you know and get grants and moneys and stuff that might be available if you knew how to resource those things i think that would be key you know [sigh] but 

257.77 267.41 B: but see i think i- if if 'cause like like like for example my mother my mother's been with the same job for twenty five years and you know what she's making she's making nineteen thousand dollars now 

261.13 262.07 A: uh-huh 

267.05 269.04 A: oh my goodness does she teach 

267.95 268.86 B: and but 

269.01 271.76 B: no she [laughter] 

269.14 269.85 A: does 

270.07 280.26 A: 'cause i was gonna say that's one of the first things you think of and it's like the worst i mean it's like oh my god i have so many friends who are teachers and are it's like it's so underpaid and i hate it because it's such an important job you know 

279.72 293.49 B: it is it is an important job and teachers should be paid well actually they should be paid very well but she's that's that's what she's making but my mother's done very well for my father n- now my dad's making so between both of them they make about fifty five between both of them 

282.96 284.14 A: yeah 

284.63 286.06 A: but now but uh your 

292.26 293.03 A: (( yes )) 

293.26 295.99 B: and they they own three pieces of property 

293.29 294.48 A: isn't that amazing 

295.82 296.83 A: wow 

295.91 310.37 B: they own an an apartment in florida they own this house in in new york you know they have a little mortgage they own a a house in columbia and they own their car and they don't you know like my mother has no debts so it's like i always said it's depending on what you make you learn to live with it 

303.53 305.00 A: wow 

309.77 320.83 A: exactly you have to adapt your lifestyle accordingly and i think unfortunately a lot of people don't do that and they live beyond their means and then you see all of this you know where people get themselves way over their head and they're kind of backpedaling but 

320.61 332.46 A: if you can if you can be frugal and you know really really adjust yourself to that lifestyle and not sit there and and all of sudden just fulfil what you actually need versus what you want you know [laughter] but uh 

330.66 342.05 B: exactly it's true because like i like i said like you know i make good money and i don't have a have anything and i'm like what the hell is going on you know because we we've pissed it away on one thing or another so 

332.47 333.18 A: (( [cough] )) 

338.29 339.81 A: exactly 

341.66 350.84 A: i think that mine mine typically seems to go down the drain on stuff like you know wanting to eat out and not feeling like cooking and just being tired and stuff like that you know mhm 

347.56 348.96 B: yeah oh 

349.03 360.39 B: that that's one thing in my house my mother still cooks every day but when i was growing up we would go out to like one restaurant that the family always went to and it was only on special occasions on somebody's birthday 

360.15 369.64 B: or you know um just for mother's day or father's day or like a holiday and it was like an inexpensive restaurant that's absolutely delicious that i still go to but like 

364.43 365.43 A: mhm 

368.36 369.22 A: right 

369.59 376.19 B: we never went out to dinner and now i can't stop going out to dinner i don't ever want to eat at home because i'm like i don't wanna cook get out of here 

371.06 371.88 A: right 

375.44 383.28 A: i know i know well that sounds so familiar my parents were the same way and it might have even been less and it sounds like when your family went out and i remember even just going to like 

383.06 393.35 A: when i would go to people's houses and spend the night as a child or something and then they would even just take us somewhere like a pizza place or a you know mcdonalds even and i was like wow 'cause we never did that you know and [laughter] 

391.50 404.25 B: yeah mcdonalds either i was scared to when i was in i was in junior high i was scared to order a sicilian 'cause i i didn't know how much it would cost i thought it was going to be so expensive because i whenever we went to the pizzeria we just got like a slice of pizza with nothing on it just the regular 

397.86 399.68 A: [laughter] 

403.98 405.28 A: [laughter] 

404.03 411.42 B: but i never missed it it was just like that was just the way we always were my mother went we got pizza and we got a slice and that was it but it's not like we were poor 

411.11 412.49 A: right right 

411.55 418.15 B: you know it was just like i my mother never even 'cause she's not american so she never thought about throwing pepperonis or anything on it she just 

417.41 418.12 A: r- 

418.66 421.06 B: [laughter] she'd get that [laughter] 

420.46 429.82 A: that's pretty amazing but yeah my father is kind of sounds very similar to like your mom i mean my dad's been there since he graduated college he's been at the same job and he actually works for the state and he 

429.62 438.38 A: you know i know that i probably make more money than my father does and it's you know and and i you know i'm just in my early thirties and my father's close to retirement age you know and 

438.21 453.08 A: and it's just amazing to me that he's had that you know that wherewithal to be able to stay with a job and uh and persistence at it and he's not somebody that you know nowadays people shift around so much you know and regardless of not making a lot of money he's stuck with it you know [laughter] and they just had m- 

448.63 449.85 B: yeah i know 

451.93 465.75 B: no and that that's the both of them have been at the same jobs for about almost you know my mom since i was i'm twenty five now so as soon as i you know i was a year old she went to work there so and she works in a nursing home so all the old women known me forever the ones who are still alive 

460.21 461.17 A: mhm 

465.36 466.49 A: right 

465.65 479.50 B: and they still remember me i remember you with your little dress or whatever and my dad too and they both work in the same town where our house is at so they don't spend a lot of money on gas they don't spend a lot on you know they don't wear and tear their car their car's from nineteen eighty eight but it's still running 

479.29 488.25 A: oh yeah absolutely and now in a day and age when people want to shift every other year to get the bigger and better big huge t._v. or something you know [laughter] huh 

481.16 482.08 B: [noise] 

486.55 494.06 B: yeah no so i i gave my mother my car because i i i my company gave me a car so i just gave her mine and she's in heaven with my car 

493.79 495.07 A: oh that's nice 

493.91 506.95 B: you know 'cause they haven't sh- 'cause now she has her own car but you know whenever they need something my car is newer so they just go out with that one but i think they you know like i said the the more money you n- you make the more money you need so you would learn to live with it if you had to 

496.33 497.50 A: very good 

507.07 517.85 B: you would probably do a lot with it if if if you weren't going backwards you know if you weren't making like thirty thousand dollars and then just making getting paid five bucks an hour is like suicide [mn] 

508.67 510.26 A: right right 

511.71 513.22 A: well and i was gonna to say 

517.21 527.98 A: right and uh you know but it but i have been in the situations and stuff actually where i have actually had to pare down and uh i whenever i first had my son i decided not to work you know i was going to stay home with him for a little while 

527.79 532.06 A: and you know that was interesting because we went down to one income and you know so you just 

531.83 544.55 A: i remember it was so funny because i think i had more my life was my maybe a little bit richer in a sense because i felt i had a lot more pride about it because it such a challenge to to go and make your life as as good as it was before but on a lot less money 

544.32 556.18 A: so it was interesting i kind of liked that challenge you know [laughter] so it's it's neat you can adapt if you're willing to if you're not just gonna sit and and you know i mean you you can you can still i mean there's a lot of outlets and like i said and different 

547.24 548.33 B: (( yeah it )) 

556.00 563.25 A: resources out there to tap into where you can get little freebies or use coupons to do this and that or whatever but you gotta get creative you know [laughter] 

562.34 569.79 B: coupons or you just you know you go with the no frills brand name if you can't you know if it's two dollars cheaper and you save two dollars here so you know 

563.57 564.75 A: [laughter] 

568.71 569.92 A: exactly 

569.90 571.87 B: you don't need to have so much 

569.99 582.29 A: and or you or you gotta look for the freebie things to do like in town instead of you know the stuff you have to pay you know out the out the wazoo to entertain yourself you're like where is a neat park where is a free baseball game you know what's going on tonight you know [laughter] 

575.33 577.07 B: exactly that it 

580.84 586.18 B: [mn] yeah instead of buying food let's bring a basket yeah absolutely so i think 

583.45 584.39 A: (( mhm )) 

585.22 586.52 A: exactly 

586.63 595.57 B: [mn] you know i like i said you've done it i i've never had to do it but i don't have any kids yet [laughter] this is like my first real serious job now as an adult 

590.04 591.07 A: yeah 

591.54 593.26 A: (( yeah well )) 

595.35 599.89 A: oh well that's exciting though that's great and so are you just out have you did you recently grad- 

595.62 596.08 B: (( so ))
