0.64 2.14 B: hi i'm debbie 

1.69 3.21 A: i'm nancy 

3.20 4.76 B: oh hi nancy 

4.45 5.88 A: how are you [laughter] 

5.07 12.26 B: [laughter] i'm good i guess we're supposed to talk about if the minimum wage increased to what did they say five fifteen 

6.53 7.26 A: what 

11.86 12.72 A: right 

12.61 13.81 B: is enough 

13.82 15.15 A: that's correct 

15.12 16.12 B: okay 

16.65 19.92 B: um i have to think about that a minute 

20.80 22.18 B: um i guess 

23.08 26.07 B: i guess it's enough i don't know what do you think [laughter] 

24.74 25.39 A: (( [laughter] )) 

25.44 35.65 A: well i think so because you know if you start in a minimum job at a low income you're not supposed to be a job you spend the rest of your life in it 

35.44 36.72 B: yeah 

35.88 49.62 A: [laughter] you're supposed to be studying and helping uh get better or if uh the other end of the coin is uh senior citizens they use that sometime to help uh supplement a little bit the 

49.59 54.54 A: minimum wage isn't supposed to be your only income the way i look at it 

54.18 62.89 B: yeah i agree i have kids in school that my son's fourteen so he's going to be you know starting a job probably up at mcdonalds or someplace like that 

62.96 65.50 B: and i'm sure he'll start at minimum wage 

65.54 73.71 B: and i don't see how you know we could be expected to pay more than that you know for a fast food job or something like that 

73.08 82.68 A: right and uh the reason we're losing so much of our business i think in this country is that to be honest that americans have got a little greedy [laughter] 

82.95 87.78 B: th- that they're they're wanting to make all the m- the profits too so 

86.97 96.42 A: uh-huh i know one party that's told me well the business he's made a profit yes if a businessman doesn't make a profit then he's not going to stay around 

96.71 98.16 B: yeah 

97.43 106.49 A: and i can't blame him and at five fifteen well uh when i started working i started at a lot less than that and we paid our bills [laughter] 

105.66 107.52 B: yeah i know what you mean 

107.69 108.79 B: um 

109.29 123.16 B: i can't see 'em raising it you know too much more than that it you know five fifteen i think is okay with me too just for that reason if they start charging more than that then it's going to pass the cost onto the consumers 

122.14 123.32 A: (( m- right )) 

123.39 125.85 A: and uh you know uh 

123.39 124.74 B: yeah 

126.16 130.88 A: basically we're talking about unskilled labor at the minimum wage 

130.67 132.17 B: mhm 

131.54 137.86 A: and if you're going too high with unskilled labor then they're not going to fool with it 

137.97 148.08 A: you look at your office machines they used to hire people to uh fold the letters and stuff you know stuff envelopes there's machines to do that now 

144.29 145.39 B: mhm 

148.29 150.19 B: right that's true 

150.70 151.52 B: yeah 

151.44 156.45 A: and uh one thing about using a machine they don't call in with sick leave [laughter] 

155.78 160.02 B: [laughter] that's true [laughter] right 

158.03 159.29 A: (( and )) 

160.16 165.81 A: uh i guess we could argue better if we both didn't agree with each other [laughter] [laughter] 

164.07 167.19 B: yeah i you know i 

167.20 177.06 B: i don't work i- it for minimum wage myself but you know i'm thinking back to when i first started working twenty years ago i did and i was really happy to get the job 

176.59 177.79 A: right 

177.12 184.87 B: so you know when people get out of high school i think minimum wage is appropriate because you know when you after you go to college then 

185.04 186.16 B: then you're 

186.20 190.62 B: [mn] you know or else take some classes at least that's when you can expect the higher salary 

190.27 193.06 A: right you start moving up the ladder 

193.56 201.61 A: and like i said most people you've got in minimum wage your young kid which they've gotta a skill somewhere 

193.56 194.52 B: right 

201.77 206.05 A: you know and that's good gas money and fun money and [laughter] [mn] 

202.02 202.88 B: right 

205.49 215.05 B: yeah even you know my stepson's twenty one he started at minimum wage a- in a warehouse and but then after thirty days he got a dollar increase 

214.61 215.74 A: right 

215.19 225.78 B: so but you know you can't expect these companies to hire someone and you know pay 'em m- more than that when they're unskilled and they can't they gotta see how they do 

226.05 227.68 B: first i think 

226.06 227.03 A: and a 

227.49 240.30 A: a lot of 'em be honest doesn't last very long it's pitiful to say but they just want that paycheck and then when they find out there's work behind that paycheck they don't even do the minimum amount of work to get that minimum wage 

240.02 244.17 B: yeah well you see that a lot i think so too 

244.68 255.04 A: and it's the same way in [sigh] they're bringing you know work o- or businesses are going to foreign countries and i don't know where you're located at but i'm in missouri 

254.73 256.01 B: i'm in ohio 

255.56 260.11 A: you're in ohio and they're bringing in a lot of mexicans up here to work 

259.93 268.61 B: yeah we have a lot of mexicans working here too and i you know i do believe they pay them less than minimum wage and i don't think that's right 

268.55 270.40 A: well uh s- 

269.27 275.91 B: to to pay to bring someone else in from a foreign country and pay them less i mean it 

274.68 279.92 A: well it uh it comes out about the same they don't have to pay uh any withholdings 

280.51 292.88 A: and uh they get free housing up here so and they're also on welfare and food stamps so [laughter] but we don't you get me started in that direction we'll never get back to minimum wage 

283.99 285.18 B: oh 

292.14 294.55 B: [laughter] okay [laughter] 

293.62 299.00 A: [laughter] because they get more benefits than our citizens would you know 

299.10 310.30 B: yeah that's that's i can see that you know after somebody works a minimum wage at at you know forty hours a week they're still going to take out at least twenty percent in taxes i would think 

310.02 317.55 A: yeah that's the bad part there's where you know they say how much they're getting but actually that's not take home pay [laughter] 

317.00 318.38 B: yeah that's 

318.51 326.42 B: so i don't think i could raise anyone could raise a family on that but i think it's good i do think it's good for unskilled jobs 

326.55 328.60 B: like we said you know 

327.72 337.13 A: but you've got to look on the other side of the c- coin even with minimum wage and if they got lord forbid four or five kids which does happen with some of 'em 

337.17 340.90 A: ah there's food stamps there's welfare 

341.45 342.53 A: (( you know )) 

342.05 343.23 B: yeah 

342.61 350.96 A: and if we keep raising the wages then all the products will keep going up then we're going to have more people that are poor that's going to need more help 

350.85 353.92 B: yeah th- that's true it's a circle isn't it mm 

353.32 354.28 A: uh-huh 

354.68 366.08 A: and they never look at you know that because mcdonalds i don't know how much their mark up is but you know it's gotta be enough percentage that they think they can make a profit on it 

365.67 366.71 B: mhm 

367.04 369.13 B: and if they started paying everybody 

369.51 370.48 B: um 

371.02 375.26 B: double minimum wage then we'd be paying double for the price of a hamburger 

374.68 384.16 A: right hamburgers fries and everything and there's other ah factors besides the wages that the business has to figure in 

384.38 386.71 A: you know their taxes their 

387.15 392.97 A: unemployment they have to carry that uh workers' comp all that 

392.65 396.92 B: so really when someone's being paid minimum wage their benefits 

396.98 402.24 B: you know are really more than that even though that's all they're seeing is in their paycheck 

400.36 401.75 A: at the time 

402.51 406.66 A: and but they you know it seems like that's the favorite thing 

406.72 411.52 A: every few years or every year almost they raise the wages 

411.00 412.55 B: mhm 

412.86 418.85 A: and i think maybe if they teach budgeting in school it would have be a little bit better 

418.76 419.95 B: mhm 

419.33 424.81 A: there are some awful smart kids but then there's some kids that can't make it from paycheck to paycheck 

424.87 427.45 B: right there's a lot of adults like that too 

427.26 433.78 A: yes and if you don't have good parents they should at least be taught in school how to balance a checkbook 

433.46 434.54 B: yeah 

435.21 437.64 B: [sigh] yeah i agree um 

437.98 439.95 B: with that 

438.49 441.57 A: but uh 

441.64 443.10 A: i don't you know 

443.63 450.95 A: i don't know if that'll happen we've got baseball basketball and everything [laughter] else but it the things that makes the kids get through life 

450.72 452.29 B: yeah 

452.39 462.35 A: and at five fifteen you know i think that's you know a pretty good uh probably maybe if they quit taking so much out of their paycheck the kids could do better 

463.00 470.24 B: well i think that they have in in a low um paycheck like that that's right there is an incentive to get an education 

470.07 471.10 A: right 

470.46 477.20 B: because when you only make five fifteen you're going to qualify for government loans and grants to get an education 

478.34 482.52 A: and then you know like we said that's just a stepping stone or 

478.43 479.08 B: (( m- )) 

482.47 496.14 A: uh like here in my town uh you know some of the mommas goes in during their lunch hour or something to catch a little extra money because they really don't want a a fulltime job they need to be home for the kids when they get off from school 

496.04 497.35 B: mhm 

496.70 501.85 A: and it's more just a fill in job instead of something that you stay at 

501.56 504.23 B: yeah i agree 

504.22 505.01 A: but 

505.63 513.28 A: i expect they'll keep the raising the wages and then keep complaining that we keep losing our businesses to other countries 

513.93 519.02 A: i think top salary in old mexico's about a dollar and a half to two dollars isn't it 

513.94 514.92 B: yeah 

519.48 520.66 B: i don't know 

520.83 522.49 B: that's not very much 

522.45 524.79 A: no but uh for them 

524.86 526.74 A: they're thrilled for that 

527.32 528.75 B: beca- it 

527.46 530.19 A: and up here uh i know uh 

529.00 538.82 B: because their cost of living is less they can afford to make that much see we couldn't afford to only pay that much here five fifteen to me is the minimum 

538.75 542.90 A: yes but uh their standards isn't as high as ours 

543.21 554.98 A: see they don't well have to have all the things that we consider like computers and uh satellites and all that you know they're happy with food on the table 

555.13 563.24 A: and up here uh they come and work for the minimum wage for five years they can go back and retire rich there 

563.84 570.46 A: they're considered a very rich person or that's what the g- one of the gentlemans i was talking to at the bank told me 

570.09 570.93 B: (( hm )) 

571.05 577.77 A: uh for five years and by the time he gets back he will be considered like we would here a millionaire there 

577.87 579.08 B: wow 

579.40 581.90 B: and that's just making minimum wage 

581.52 583.41 A: that's making minimum wage 

584.24 585.58 B: that is something 

585.89 593.78 A: but uh for minimum wage he doesn't have withholdings which i think our kids should have the same thing [laughter] 

594.04 599.95 B: yeah well i i think in our incentive is you know that earned income credit when you do your taxes
