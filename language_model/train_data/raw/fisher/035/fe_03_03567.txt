22.15 33.90 A: oh gosh well i actually my son just got a job and i suspect he'll be making minimum wage and i would have to say no even at eighteen five dollars and fifteen cents doesn't seem to be enough [laughter] 

23.30 24.39 B: but 

33.23 47.07 B: oh it's nothing i mean i i worked for five dollars and fifteen cents you know when i was like fourteen and you know i could still live at my parents' house they could still feed me and i had like you know a nice little paycheck to go buy myself things you know i could live off that when i'm 

47.15 49.46 B: fourteen but not you know when i 

49.76 55.05 B: went into college and all that there's just no way that i could live off that 

54.66 57.35 A: oh absolutely yeah i agree 

56.26 57.77 B: there's just no way 

57.81 63.42 B: and i live in um [lipsmack] the town like we we i live in santa fe new mexico 

63.16 64.18 A: okay 

64.20 66.01 B: and so like um 

66.13 72.12 B: you it's really really expensive to live there like property is just like ridiculously overpriced 

72.13 78.80 B: and like everything is just ridiculously expensive and then they expect us to work for um [noise] five fifteen 

79.07 84.34 B: and there's just n- there's no way like you have to get like a little [noise] like piece of 

84.64 86.19 B: ho- housing 

86.03 88.56 A: right right the um 

89.22 103.05 A: even beyond minimum wage it's it's amazing when people are just making just a little bit above it it's still how do you live you know how do you how do ever afford not only a place to live but the food that you need and health insurance and you know 

95.72 96.64 B: right 

101.52 107.04 B: right 'cause like a lot of places but i like i'm still young like i haven't been able to keep a job for very long and 

107.14 119.16 B: you know i need health insurance but i can't have he- i'm i don't qualify for health insurances 'til you know i've worked for at a job for a certain amount of time but you know i move around a lot i'm still trying to figure where i want to live and what i want to do so 

113.56 114.68 A: mhm 

118.95 122.39 B: you know i can't stick around at a job long enough to establish 

122.43 134.40 B: you know a good insurance and a steady income they're talking about actually raising um [lipsmack] minimum wage in santa fe to like ten dollars an hour but they've been talking about that for a few years and i don't think it's going to happen 

134.51 136.93 A: wow yeah well the 

137.24 140.81 A: i think part of the issue is the small business owners really struggle 

140.85 143.90 A: every time that that the wage goes up but then again 

144.11 157.95 A: who are you going to get although in today's economy it might be different but when we were in full employment and and most everyone was working to g- to find somebody to to work a minimum wage job was really really hard 

157.82 158.81 B: right 

158.70 166.83 A: and you know now there are people that are that are that were were used to making a lot of money that are accepting minimum wage jobs just to have something 

166.96 167.89 B: right 

168.15 169.04 A: so 

168.34 182.49 B: it's like i i can't you know work with what i want but i'm struggling so hard for money that i need to accept this little five fifteen an hour job but then i w- actually like i think i worked so hard but then i don't get paid nearly enough 

180.11 181.06 A: mhm 

182.49 186.84 B: you know i- it doesn't compensate you know how hard i work 

186.87 189.04 A: right right and 

188.01 188.75 B: (( it's )) 

190.08 193.27 B: it it's like i i worked this um [lipsmack] 

190.87 191.76 A: it it 

193.65 199.93 B: i worked at this little bagel shop and they wanted me to scrub down the store every single night 

199.95 201.66 B: like the owner is this really 

202.17 212.52 B: [mn] uh uh i don't even wanna go into it but he wanted me to scrub it every he said he said every single night i want this place to look like the day i opened it up and i'm like well you're paying me five fifteen an hour so 

204.24 205.21 A: [laughter] 

212.86 223.68 B: you know after a while he just started to get so like anal about it it's just like i'm gonna g- give you five fifteen an hour's worth of work [laughter] so if you want me to s- work really hard and you know 

220.26 221.33 A: right 

223.64 228.13 B: s- working up a sweat for hours at a time you know may- maybe you should you know 

228.16 229.73 B: give me a little bit more 

229.53 230.57 A: mhm 

230.58 241.85 A: yeah yeah that dilemma of feeling that that you're you're being fairly compensated for the work you do hate to tell you it [mn] people don't feel that they are even when they're making a whole lot more than five fifteen an hour [laughter] 

236.15 237.17 B: right 

241.15 242.48 B: [laughter] right 

242.17 245.88 A: [laughter] i'm not sure it gets any better but but i mean 

246.01 249.49 A: just thinking about the the unskilled workers that are 

249.54 250.74 A: that are taking 

250.93 256.03 A: th- these jobs you know beyond being a teenager where okay you gotta start somewhere 

255.91 256.92 B: right 

256.01 267.38 A: but um you know the people that are in their thirties and forties that it's the only job they can get because maybe they're a new immigrant or or they've lived here for a while but 

267.45 275.94 A: they just don't have a lot of skill or can't work in the the the industry they want to because they don't speak english very well or or you know for whatever reason 

274.18 275.05 B: right 

276.75 278.78 A: and how do you raise a family on 

279.18 280.98 B: i don't know [laughter] 

280.34 286.16 A: that you know s- so i i'm you know even my brother who has has a job that get pays him better than minimum wage 

286.56 289.93 A: will still work side jobs just to make ends meet 

289.94 295.29 A: you know we live in the mid west in in st louis so it's pretty inexpensive to live here 

290.16 291.09 B: right 

295.29 296.43 B: mhm 

295.89 307.18 A: and there's still a lot of people struggling so i don't how people manage to live in places like santa fe or california or new york or or the people i used to work with in connecticut it's like how 

307.36 310.12 A: well you know what do you do it's like well all we do is work 

310.93 312.37 A: it's like is that a- 

311.10 316.82 B: and the- and then that that you don't get to spend time with your family or your friends or give time for yourself even 

316.88 317.80 A: right 

317.98 319.32 A: right it it just is 

318.29 320.42 B: i i i think they need to 

320.64 322.89 B: raise minimum wage if if 

323.11 334.41 B: the price of living goes up they need to raise minimum wage 'cause i think that's just what's been happening is the price of living has gone way high up but we're still working for the same amount 

326.77 328.04 A: right 

334.09 343.96 A: right i don't think minimum wage has changed a whole lot [mn] um now i'm forty so you know it was certainly lower when i was a teenager but it wasn't that much lower 

343.98 345.87 B: right how much was it 

344.78 348.14 A: so um i'm guessing boy 

348.79 359.55 A: [mn] it was probably between four and five dollars i don't think it was lower than that i mean i don't ever even remember getting paid less than that in fact the jobs i i got were in retail and they paid better than that 

352.57 353.44 B: right 

359.44 360.35 B: right 

360.16 364.14 A: so you know okay that was that was twenty two years ago 

364.58 367.78 A: and you're right the cost of living has escalated 

367.90 378.72 A: and the cost of goods the see the thing it's it's just such a dilemma because i i am a small business owner and i i don't have employees i just have me but if i was hiring people 

378.75 381.66 A: it would be very hard because 

380.41 381.33 B: mhm 

381.61 393.89 A: you know you've you gotta have a guaranteed income so that you know you can meet payroll so that you can meet the health benefit needs and all of those things have gone up in price and then you know the employee wants to be paid well jeeze 

393.67 399.86 A: so i you know i can understand the dilemma from a a business standpoint but from a a humanistic standpoint 

399.98 402.39 A: we can't expect people to live on this 

402.43 406.96 A: and then and not provide them with services to help them out like childcare 

402.70 404.06 B: right 

407.15 408.11 B: mhm 

407.87 412.05 A: um or other things that that will ease their burden 

412.17 416.39 A: you know or or some type of a of a health benefit that will [mn] 

412.44 413.29 B: right 

416.63 419.26 A: you know offset the money they're not making 

419.86 420.72 B: right 

419.94 421.48 A: (( so [mn] )) 

421.59 422.48 A: um 

423.19 424.02 A: and to 

423.27 424.21 B: i think 

424.59 434.60 B: i'm sorry were you done [laughter] [laughter] uh um i also think that like i i've been working as a waitress like that's uh like i'd rather wait tables than 

425.45 426.62 A: uh yeah 

434.80 439.89 B: you know work retail but you know because they assume that we're going to be getting tips 

440.07 445.75 B: you get paid less than minimum wage like my last job i was getting paid two thirteen an hour 

445.59 446.53 A: mhm 

446.27 454.87 B: plus tips and you know if you include in the tips and divide it out to the hours you know it calculated i was making maybe about ten or eleven dollars an hour 

454.86 463.61 B: but waiting tables is hard work like it's a l- i think it's a lot harder than you know folding clothes and you know dealing with 

457.85 458.72 A: (( hm yeah [laughter] )) 

463.70 465.67 B: obnoxious customers 'cause 

465.71 472.40 B: you know i'm bringing obnoxious customers their food and i'm only getting paid two thirteen an hour i'm on my feet running around i have to make sure 

472.27 480.76 B: everyone in is you know doing okay everything's running smoothly the food's looking good i'm sort of li- like if they don't leave me a good tip then i'm stuck at two thirteen an hour 

480.68 484.74 A: yeah and it's amazing to me how many people don't seem to realize that that 

484.91 485.81 A: um 

486.26 491.40 A: y- you know that they'll walk out and not leave a tip at all or you know leave something really measly 

491.45 492.41 B: right 

491.85 492.55 A: um 

492.70 498.34 A: you know i mean if it was deserved okay but if it wasn't you know if you really busted your gut and did a good job then 

498.47 503.78 B: they don't realize that we're living off those tips 'cause we don't get paid much hourly wage 

503.38 510.31 A: right right and you know i guess the really the same is w- is true with minimum wage that's the you know minimum wage and no tips 

510.40 511.48 B: right 

510.86 523.40 A: you know there at least as a as a waiter or waitress you have the opportunity of making more than what you're getting paid but those people don't you know it's that's it and then gee what can they expect at you know at raise time 

519.06 520.01 B: right 

523.93 526.88 A: maybe you know twenty cents ten cents you know 

526.14 535.23 B: right like i was i was um bussing tables for a while and you know we made a little bit more than the service 'cause we we only got like you know a a percentage of their tips 

535.02 535.94 A: mhm 

535.56 546.16 B: and we got paid four dollars an hour instead of the two dollars an hour but you know i i was there and i got a twenty five cent raise and you know it it wasn't 

544.21 545.09 A: wow 

546.43 550.07 B: y- you know it was a little bit but it wasn't anything significant 

549.78 550.77 A: mhm 

551.46 552.33 A: yeah 

551.77 552.40 B: (( [mn] )) 

552.64 558.29 A: boy this topic's a lot lot more difficult than the one i had yesterday [laughter] pets 

555.75 557.62 B: [laughter] what did you have 

558.09 560.44 B: i had pets the other day too [laughter] 

559.80 569.51 A: yeah that's an easy one minimum wage how about pets that get paid minimum wage um now that would be good 'cause i've got two puppies and it would be nice if they would get paid something [laughter] 

561.28 562.63 B: [laughter] 

564.74 566.11 B: [laughter] 

569.65 572.53 B: 'cause then they could you know help bring in some of the 

571.12 571.87 A: earn 

572.18 573.35 A: (( exactly )) 

573.04 574.21 B: house costs 

573.95 580.83 A: right well i'd just be happy if they would vacuum the living room floor but [laughter] [laughter] okay 

577.76 578.56 B: (( or )) 

579.70 581.96 B: if your cat could va- vacuum 

581.86 587.68 A: y- yeah or or if the cat could vacuum yeah we have a cat too so that might be good and she's not real happy about that suggestion 

584.75 586.21 B: [laughter] 

587.48 592.65 B: yeah my my mother's coming to visit tomorrow so we've been like scrubbing the apartment and 

592.40 593.72 A: [laughter] 

593.63 599.89 B: you know i gotta make it look good 'cause she's act- like she's actually been paying for my living expenses because i'm like in school fulltime
