0.76 2.61 A: (( h- hello )) 

2.78 4.54 B: hi my name's deborah 

4.30 5.67 A: hi i'm tina 

5.49 8.15 B: tina well [laughter] nice to talk to you 

7.48 9.38 A: nice to talk to you 

8.92 14.35 B: [laughter] so it looks like our topic of the day is the minimum wage increase 

13.99 15.41 A: right 

14.80 26.69 B: i w- i had didn't even know that they were about to increase it again i i hadn't heard that [sigh] well i i think they said that it w- was increasing to five fifteen an hour and i 

24.95 26.53 A: (( [laughter] right )) 

26.59 30.53 B: thought that that's about what it was that's terrible [laughter] 

29.65 37.02 A: well i know i was working a job myself not too long ago for minimum wage and i do not see how people make it 

36.60 38.32 B: [laughter] yeah i mean 

37.31 39.55 A: working you know [laughter] 

38.81 46.25 B: oh oh definitely if it if it just increased to five if it's about to increase to five fifteen what was it before 

40.83 41.74 A: (( [mn] [laughter] )) 

43.28 44.34 A: right 

46.13 54.71 A: i don't know i thought that it was five forty but i guess i was wrong [laughter] 'cause 

51.20 56.55 B: [laughter] [laughter] well that's [laughter] that's terrible [laughter] 

54.87 60.15 A: ((  )) 

59.79 73.21 B: oh no [laughter] [laughter] yeah five fifteen just doesn't sound right at all [laughter] you know the minimum wage it it's pretty bad if anybody has to work for that but i think it should be like six fifty or something 

64.73 66.32 A: no [laughter] 

70.68 71.89 A: right 

73.03 74.50 A: at least 

73.05 76.15 B: even that even that people can't live on 

75.60 78.28 A: at least because the cost of living is so high 

78.07 91.19 B: [sigh] definitely definitely and and 'specially state to state if this minimum wage is the same all throughout the united states it's even worse in some parts of the country 

78.77 79.75 A: [laughter] 

83.21 84.32 A: yeah 

87.38 88.72 A: right 

90.52 97.01 A: yeah i know the area that i'm in the cost is living is a lot lower than it is other places and people here 

96.75 97.67 B: uh-huh 

97.04 101.97 A: if they're working for minimum wage have to work two or three jobs to even make ends meet so [laughter] 

101.36 111.28 B: oh jeeze yeah that's terrible [laughter] well i'm i'm in dallas in dallas texas and the cost of living is pretty high here 

109.90 121.69 A: [noise] oh well i'm sure it's a whole lot higher there than it is here i live in a rural area of tennessee i'm actually about sixty sixty five miles outside of memphis 

114.04 115.68 B: (( yeah [lipsmack] )) 

121.59 123.23 B: oh okay 

122.62 123.85 A: so [laughter] some 

124.01 138.04 B: well you know i i with the cost of living the way it is here i can't imagine anybody in say new york or los angeles or something like that even beginning to [mn] be able to work for something that [sigh] 

131.89 133.26 A: no 

135.44 140.12 A: yeah to be able to survive on that amount that is just unreal 

139.76 144.49 B: yeah there [laughter] there's no way they'd have to work four jobs [laughter] 

143.40 147.08 A: yeah and if they had a child and had to pay daycare 

146.96 148.42 B: there's no way 

147.25 149.06 A: they might as well stay home 

148.84 154.66 B: yeah yeah and it's it's probably the reason there is such a a big um a 

154.88 156.70 B: a homeless problem 

156.38 157.55 A: that's true 

157.22 165.01 B: because you're seeing people now that um the it's it's like whole families where they've got you know three kids and 

162.23 163.02 A: right 

164.45 165.91 A: right 

165.05 176.60 B: it's just so sad and and it seems like the homeless problem is just about everywhere it's not only in big cities anymore it's in a lot of little cities and that's just so sad 

171.88 173.08 A: that's true 

174.88 176.07 A: that's true 

176.27 182.49 A: yeah it is i don't see how they can even consider that to be a sufficient amount 

177.59 178.95 B: oh dear 

182.21 185.73 B: yeah that's true that's true but then again 

182.91 183.87 A: yeah [laughter] 

185.76 197.24 B: you know maybe it would be higher if the country wasn't paying such a high welfare amount it um it just oh it just makes me sick i um 

190.35 191.63 A: that's true 

192.83 193.85 A: (( that's true )) 

197.13 208.45 B: uh knew somebody that was a friend of a boyfriend i dated last year and i've never known anybody that was on welfare before and um this was a f- a 

206.14 207.02 A: right 

208.39 217.14 B: a friend of his and i just couldn't even believe how well somebody lived 

216.98 226.63 B: that was on welfare there were times that they were living better than me because they get so much it and it was because he had kids and and mind you 

222.19 223.11 A: right 

225.59 226.63 A: that's true 

226.75 237.79 B: and a- and these were not even kids from marriage you know how some people they just keep popping out kids and and the welfare system doesn't put any 

226.77 227.60 A: yeah 

234.39 235.36 A: right 

235.71 237.27 A: right [laughter] [laughter] 

237.65 245.20 B: you they and they don't stop 'em and they just keep giving 'em more and more money and [mn] and this man wasn't even working 

241.50 242.73 A: that's right 

244.99 256.02 B: and he had several kids and yet he was getting welfare and he got a couple of hundred dollars a month just for food and the and it just and make it 

252.51 258.16 A: right and making more money than somebody that works sixty hours a week 

257.71 265.74 B: i know and it made me sick not only that they got discounted rent i mean mind you i'm in a in a house and 

258.44 259.58 A: [laughter] 

262.23 263.07 A: right 

264.16 265.79 A: (( medical insurance [laughter] yeah yeah )) 

265.53 277.02 B: yeah they i mean he got oh and definitely the insurance i can't even afford insurance and he got you know big time insurance and he's not even working 

274.84 276.10 A: right 

276.70 277.63 A: yeah 

277.41 282.49 B: [sigh] that [laughter] that that's i guess one of my pet peeves is that 

281.36 283.88 A: [laughter] yeah oh mine too [laughter] 

283.17 287.32 B: that they don't restructure the welfare system it's just 

285.29 286.46 A: right 

286.47 287.31 A: right 

287.55 293.21 B: it's it's not fair and then you know here you got people working for minimum wage barely 

289.81 290.95 A: [mn] that's true 

292.94 294.16 A: yeah 

293.62 295.85 B: (( able to survive [laughter] )) 

295.06 302.61 A: that's [laughter] that's exactly right it it'll be interesting to see the feedback they get from this question wouldn't it [laughter] [laughter] 

297.55 299.10 B: [sigh] oh 

302.02 308.00 B: (( yeah [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] it that )) 

304.44 305.85 A: [laughter] oh 

306.21 311.55 A: no i think if they feel like that this is a sufficient amount for minimum wage 

311.24 312.42 B: oh jeeze 

311.58 319.07 A: they need to pull some of these guys out of the offices in washington and let them work for this amount for a little while and go back and vote again 

317.68 318.98 B: yeah 

318.97 320.53 B: oh definitely 

319.74 321.70 A: (( [laughter] )) 

320.50 335.47 B: yes but you know that it it'll never happen our president's a millionaire he was a millionaire before well i mean i i guess you know and it's kind of sad living in texas but he bought the presidency he wasn't picked he bought the presidency 

325.19 326.43 A: (( no yeah )) 

335.28 342.80 B: but he's a millionaire he can't relate to other people his family cannot relate it's just um 

342.96 355.31 B: [sigh] you know he's done some things that are good but on so many aspects and you know welfare and minimum wage and and those type a things he cannot relate whatsoever 

354.10 355.89 A: [mn] that's true 

356.10 357.47 B: so um 

356.93 361.25 A: well a lot of the ones that are sitting in washington can't relate you know [laughter] 

360.54 370.12 B: well that's true that's true a lot of them did come from and very w- well off families and um and i i don't think you can relate that way 

365.45 367.17 A: right 

369.56 370.51 A: no 

370.50 372.84 B: so um [laughter] 

371.67 378.72 A: no but if they had could go for say six months to a year living on this amount of money they might see things a little different 

378.79 388.85 B: oh isn't that the truth oh [laughter] it'll never happen but boy [laughter] things would change if it did [laughter] 

379.41 380.58 A: [laughter] 

381.41 382.42 A: [laughter] 

382.63 383.45 A: mm 

384.40 385.44 A: no 

386.05 387.41 A: (( yeah )) 

387.43 389.85 A: yeah it would 

389.64 391.27 B: oh dear 

391.31 393.89 B: (( [lipsmack] well i minimum wage )) 

394.23 397.09 B: oh it's just so sad i mean [sigh] 

397.17 411.36 B: teenagers you know i can understand teenagers their first job working for five fifteen an hour but anybody who's you know even in their twenties or or older shouldn't have to work for that little 

407.69 408.56 A: yeah 

410.32 411.32 A: (( yeah no )) 

411.92 420.36 A: no and what's what's really sad is the restaurants can get away with paying their waitresses two fifty an hour and expect them to make up the difference on tips 

412.19 413.00 B: (( oh dear )) 

420.26 421.95 B: oh i know 

421.39 422.95 A: (( so [laughter] )) 

422.13 424.20 B: i know and and sometimes 

423.04 425.91 A: so no minimum wage is nothing [laughter] 

425.19 426.27 B: (( mhm )) 

426.36 438.51 B: that that's true that's true and some restaurants in some places that i imagine they get into you know 'cause i i've known people way back when that did that they made a lot of money and they you know 

438.36 449.66 B: it was under the table so they didn't have to pay taxes on it and made a lot of money but then on the total opposite end a lot of them don't make enough to survive because they're getting so little an hour 

441.17 442.07 A: right 

446.95 448.03 A: that's true 

449.46 453.59 B: and that's another thing i think should you know sort of be changed 

449.59 450.48 A: right 

453.25 454.15 A: (( yes )) 

454.15 461.76 B: even if they could get five fifteen an hour i'm sure they'd be happy [laughter] to go along with their tips anyway [laughter] 

456.98 457.77 A: (( yes )) 

460.51 462.63 A: yeah yeah yeah 

462.93 468.30 B: [laughter] i don't know being a waitress i've never been a waitress myself but i i've known 

468.33 478.69 B: [lipsmack] quite a few people that have have been wait staff before and um i think it's very hard for them to hang onto money because the majority of their money is all in cash 

478.31 479.37 A: that's true 

478.68 483.68 B: and it's real easy to go through cash and not know where it's spent you know 

481.66 483.01 A: yeah it is 

483.59 494.34 B: it people that ah that i've known before they were eating out every day and doing stuff every day and then it's like all their money was just slipping through their hands and 

488.67 490.05 A: (( yeah mhm [laughter] )) 

493.72 495.79 A: and they have no record of where it went [laughter] 

495.63 505.53 B: they have no record of where it went they can't afford a house and yeah it's it's a big problem that uh i've noticed that problem 

505.71 509.16 B: in uh in people that have done that type of work that 

509.57 519.70 B: if [laughter] i try not to carry too much cash around because it does it just it's so easy to just keep buying little stuff with it and then it just all goes 

514.03 515.02 A: (( [laughter] yeah )) 

519.46 520.29 A: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

519.52 533.12 B: so [laughter] at least with a checking account you can keep track of things and [laughter] you bought something you shouldn't have at least you know the money went [laughter] oh dear 

524.71 526.98 A: yeah yeah [laughter] 

529.65 531.08 A: yeah [laughter] 

532.61 533.31 A: (( so )) 

534.43 537.26 B: [laughter] oh man i can't imagine 

536.27 539.34 A: and no me either i just 

539.68 549.62 A: you know like i said i worked a minimum wage job i had a four year old that i put in daycare and after well i worked for a little over three months 

544.80 545.73 B: uh-huh 

549.30 550.29 B: mhm 

550.02 555.49 A: and there wasn't a significant difference in our household budget because by the time 

555.64 560.44 A: i i had to spend that's true the daycare and the gas back and forth 

555.72 558.02 B: [mn] by the time you paid daycare 

560.05 561.05 B: mhm 

560.55 573.60 A: and you know me having to carry my meals because a lot of times when i would work i would have to carry something for breakfast and something for lunch too because i would work strange hours and it was just 

564.01 564.98 B: yeah 

569.81 570.46 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

572.98 574.05 B: yeah 

574.06 575.46 A: so i don't see 

575.70 578.94 A: how it benefits people to work for that little amount of money mhm 

578.76 582.96 B: yeah oh definitely and especially when you have kids 

582.37 583.32 A: right 

582.91 590.66 B: [sigh] i don't know i mean i think the government should have a program we seem like such a rich nation but you don't where the money goes and 

590.46 599.89 B: and i i'm one of these people who really believes that we should have free medical and free dental and free daycare i just don't understand 

598.13 599.03 A: you would 

599.17 599.89 A: it would ben-
