440.66 441.37 A: (( [noise] [mn] [noise] [noise] )) 

444.00 455.37 B: i mean i don't know that that many businesses actually pay minimum wage there's a you know certain ones do but i know you know 'cause you can get minimum wage anywhere so if they want people to work there 

449.21 450.29 A: right 

455.54 457.74 B: they're gonna pump the rate up a little bit 

457.61 458.70 A: (( [noise] right )) 

458.05 460.92 B: i used to be in the staffing industry so [mn] [noise] 

459.88 468.08 A: [noise] ah oh yeah [mn] well i know i know i found out our chefs only start chefs start only at seven fifty an hour 

468.19 476.65 A: [mn] where we are [mn] i was like a chef [mn] you know yeah a new chef with no experience or very little experience will start at seven fifty an hour 

469.41 470.75 B: (( you're kidding me )) 

473.05 473.89 B: (( right [noise] )) 

474.15 475.54 B: but still

478.86 487.14 A: [noise] [noise] right right [mn] i couldn't even believe that i was shocked to hear that because i thought that they make twelve fourteen bucks an hour [mn] [noise] [noise] 

486.26 495.13 B: my girlfriend's um husband is is a chef in a restaurant in philly and you know he makes five grand a week [mn] so 

488.98 490.29 A: (( [noise] [noise] ))

507.89 508.82 A: [laughter] 

508.86 513.68 A: [mn] yeah but nah they definitely need to raise it [noise] all across the country though 

513.73 514.31 A: (( [noise] )) 

514.46 518.11 B: i agree the question is what do they need to raise it to that people can 

518.37 519.32 B: (( you know )) 

519.37 524.05 B: 'cause right now if you go ten bucks an hour somewhere you're making some some cash 

523.30 526.00 A: [noise] [noise] right right definitely [mn] 

525.27 528.90 B: i mean collectors make start out at like nine [noise] 

528.34 534.94 A: and they're definitely not gonna raise it at that i mean but at least [mn] try and raise it to eight or seven fifty or something 

530.47 531.66 B: (( no way [laughter] [noise] )) 

534.81 537.13 B: yeah because if you figure seven fifty 

537.66 540.10 B: times forty that's three hundred bucks a week 

539.81 545.33 A: [noise] right [mn] which is somewhat liveable [laughter] 

544.67 547.04 B: [noise] it's like twelve nine a year or something 

546.89 549.76 A: right [mn] better than eight [mn] 

549.30 555.61 B: yeah i mean either that or you're gonna have to wind up having to work five million trillion hours 

555.31 566.17 A: right right [mn] and you know in my [noise] job won't even let they don't even like you to work overtime unless they have to schedule you schedule it to you because they gotta pay you know time and a half and [noise] 

565.38 566.94 B: right 

566.41 570.67 A: [mn] um forget it and then you know you want more hours but they won't give it to ya 

570.03 574.92 B: exactly i mean you're figuring fifteen thousand six hundred bucks for um 

575.83 577.37 B: for seven fifty an hour 

577.28 578.46 A: (( [noise] [noise] right )) 

577.40 582.33 B: so fifteen grand if you can live on it you can live on that and better than [mn] 

582.36 583.63 B: you know ten 

583.31 584.86 A: (( [noise] right [noise] )) 

584.70 586.78 B: you just can't have much [laughter] 

586.32 587.15 A: (( [laughter] )) 

587.64 590.73 A: [noise] you save those pennies [noise] 

589.37 594.13 B: exactly i mean you're walking away with more a little over twelve five so [noise]
