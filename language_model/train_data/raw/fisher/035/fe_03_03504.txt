39.21 44.02 B: look how we're living but the way what they're paying us we can't even 

44.04 47.10 B: they're taking so much taxes from us

64.15 65.64 B: okay yeah 

65.17 73.14 A: you know the cost of living is lower here but it's it's ridiculous the sales tax is still ten percent or nearly it's nine percent you might as well say ten percent 

72.78 73.94 B: yeah 

73.33 77.32 A: so that hits everybody equally which is is pretty ridiculous

76.72 78.32 B: what's your name lisa 

77.88 78.83 A: yes 

78.53 84.66 B: okay i was just wondering if you know when i met people over this line if i ever could get uh 

84.89 94.42 B: i mean i never asked them if i ever kinda become friends or with someone i really like on the line i never asked the the people when i started from 

92.55 93.67 A: yeah 

94.53 98.25 B: 'cause we're we're only allowed like ten minutes to talk 

97.79 98.99 A: exactly 

98.68 101.27 B: and i never asked them if i was allowed to 

101.72 107.32 B: to get friendly with them in in my real life they never told me if if i i can do that 

104.21 105.42 A: [laughter] 

106.75 114.54 A: well you know what i don't know 'cause i've only done one other call but um anyway so do do you know anyone who actually makes minimum wage 

114.49 118.46 B: um it used to be my it used to be me but i won't do it 

114.80 116.18 A: in new york 

118.24 119.42 A: i don't blame you 

119.05 122.32 B: and it used to be my husband but he got laid off 

122.65 123.93 B: from the job 

123.69 124.75 A: yeah 

124.46 134.52 B: so now i'm like i'm saying i'd rather sit home and try to make my own way in a business trying to get myself together 'cause i'm an actress but i'm not working right now 

133.45 134.72 A: oh how cool 

134.54 141.34 B: because it's slow because of the economy over here but once it picks up you know there's work you 

137.56 138.48 A: right 

141.29 142.26 A: gotta ya 

141.98 142.91 B: know 

143.12 148.43 A: well i i don't see how anyone could live in new york city any- anywhere close to minimum wage [lipsmack] 

149.56 157.45 B: i don't know but um i have ideas about businesses and i just have to get it off the ground that's all and that's what i'm working on 

158.02 159.45 A: i understand 

158.68 163.57 B: and my friend told me about this you know job here 

163.77 166.29 B: situation and i said i'll take 

167.32 168.42 B: it you know 

167.87 177.85 A: yeah well this is this is a a good deal but to to get back to that minimum wage thing i know you get i know that we're not supposed to vary too far off the topic but what what 

170.36 171.19 B: (( yep )) 

178.24 181.81 A: um no it's hard to talk about one topic for ten minutes 

182.24 185.58 B: i know that's that's the reason why um 

185.76 192.07 B: if i like someone over the line i wanted to know if i could've became friendly with them but i would ask the office 

191.51 193.01 A: yeah i don't know 

192.60 196.44 B: you know 'cause i don't wanna do anything to jeopardize this 

196.60 200.69 B: this situation here [laughter] you know 

198.41 200.40 A: yeah no i understand 

200.95 205.46 A: so with uh i mean what was minimum wage when you were working for minimum wage 

205.03 209.35 B: um at the time it was three dollars an hour i'm forty two now 

207.95 210.17 A: oh my gosh 

209.51 214.53 B: and then it was um four four fifteen five fifteen 

214.65 216.70 B: now it's six 

216.74 221.18 B: then it's going into seven it depends on the people where you go 

220.77 221.82 A: right 

221.23 223.88 B: some of 'em will still pay you five fifteen 

223.59 230.27 A: well it's it's i mean i i i can't imagine anyone working for less than seven fifty or eight dollars an hour because i don't 

229.03 237.16 B: well i used to and then i stopped i would i would only even a week on the job not even and i would walk off the job 

234.42 235.70 A: (( well i don't blame you )) 

237.42 243.81 B: so i don't even do that anymore only only if i did it again it would be for my security work 

243.54 244.42 A: right 

244.10 246.32 B: because i need my license 

246.65 253.40 B: when you don't have a license you're not allowed to make any more than than the minimum wage with without the license 

253.19 256.05 A: with security work you mean you do private security 

254.98 263.95 B: i'm a security officer and they hired me for six dollars an hour and i had to take it because i was never an officer before i only have a a certificate 

263.39 264.33 A: right 

263.96 271.05 B: so i had to take it because no one would hire me for more than that without a license and i was never experienced 

271.22 274.52 B: so now that i'm experienced i need a license now 

274.06 283.03 A: right well i think that sometimes you have to to do what you have to do in order to you know you work for basically nothing in order to get the experience or get to what you have to do to 

278.51 280.04 B: yeah but you know 

280.82 281.84 B: (( right )) 

282.17 294.00 B: uh-huh but now the way i looked in in my outfit and having a walkie talkie walking around you would never think i was making six dollars an hour because i i look so professional 

291.52 292.42 A: (( no )) 

294.27 307.17 B: but i couldn't wait for the license and they gave me a job on the wrong site where there's um little little you know one of these little now and i got scared [laughter] i just had to had to leave 

302.46 303.45 A: mhm 

304.40 306.01 A: [laughter] i don't blame you 

307.75 315.90 B: oh my god what they did i wish they would've put me somewhere else they the first time i started they put me uh in a nice place 

316.00 318.93 B: on forty second street called dukes theater 

318.76 319.86 A: (( yeah [cough] )) 

319.61 325.22 B: and it was wonderful there but he had to change me and now i had to go to like an instruction 

325.41 328.71 B: not an instruction excuse me a construction 

328.84 329.83 B: site 

330.76 340.25 B: and i almost got hurt because something could've fell on my head from the ceiling from the top where they were making the uh 

338.03 338.96 A: well that's 

340.61 346.49 B: you know the construction it it was a big building they were uh trying to build and they 

341.26 341.96 A: right 

342.18 343.55 A: that's not good 

345.69 346.72 A: well see 

347.17 348.19 A: they they could 

347.21 348.88 B: didn't give me a helmet 

348.71 361.46 A: gotta ya they could probably keep better people if they would pay more than minimum wage more than six dollars an hour or whatever i mean that's that's the the problem i think with the economy in general is they could keep people employed they could 

358.68 360.75 B: well yeah 

361.38 366.58 A: you know if pay decent pay people a decent wage then they won't be leaving every week 

361.97 363.31 B: i mean they 

366.25 380.85 B: uh-huh well you see our mayor over here laid off a lotta people and once mayor bloomberg laid off a lotta people and he wants them to pay more taxes but how do you do that when you lay them off 

371.61 373.02 A: the mayor did

412.57 413.78 A: (( oh okay okay )) 

414.78 416.68 B: okay since he's been the mayor 

417.06 418.42 A: well that's a shame 

418.08 427.37 B: yeah but 'cause you you see now before my husband got laid off i heard there was gonna be layoffs but you know i wasn't really uh listening to it 

427.89 429.05 B: you know 

428.56 429.46 A: right

474.14 475.20 A: (( [mn] )) 

474.61 480.43 B: you know what i'm saying so we have to my i my uh idea 

475.76 476.84 A: yeah 

480.53 489.14 B: is that we have to become an independent contractor i mean an an independent worker for ourselves and not rely on the government 

488.28 489.74 A: yeah exactly 

489.73 503.89 B: and how do we go about that we have to learn more about what what i was just saying you know what i was just speaking about how do we go about that becoming an independent worker without relying on the government supporting us 

495.10 495.91 A: well 

503.25 508.84 A: well you can there are all kinds of small businesses out there i mean that's the bigger especially for women 

509.14 510.67 A: and if you i mean 

510.69 514.65 A: like if you ever make it as an actress you won't have to worry about that 'cause 

513.96 521.48 B: well that i know but i mean that's still what i mean is that's still depending on someone else to give us a job 

514.95 516.23 A: [laughter] that you know 

521.52 529.72 B: (( but if we have an idea like if you and i had an an idea and you knew me and i knew you we can we can invent an idea )) 

529.44 530.45 A: right 

529.83 535.65 B: and we go somewhere and we publicize it and somebody bought it we're rich 

535.74 536.90 A: (( yeah )) 

536.91 541.28 A: yeah yeah it it would be nice if that could happen for sure mhm 

536.95 537.93 B: (( you know )) 

540.21 550.22 B: yeah well i i i like these ideas that i have in my head but i need somebody to just help me with it that's all because you need to take it somewhere 

550.24 553.04 A: well keep on working on those ideas 

551.88 553.52 B: (( you know what i'm saying )) 

553.05 559.27 A: because especially if you're gonna continue to live i mean did you ever think of moving from new york city or is that you just love it or what 

558.10 565.25 B: well i wanted to go to california you know i was there my husband doesn't wanna leave new york 

562.65 563.50 A: yeah 

565.18 576.14 A: well i i tell ya i love new york uh but uh i don't know that i could live there all the time just because there's so many people but you'd kinda get claustrophobic but i really love new york 

574.45 584.34 B: well yes well it's not just see it's not the people for me it's more or less the the attitude here they don't like they look at you like when you say hello 

583.94 585.42 A: [noise] 

584.30 596.32 B: they look at you like you know why are you saying hello to me for and then when you go to other states and they say hel- you know you look at them and they they say hello you're like w- why are you talking to me because i'm not used to that 

587.15 588.50 A: (( [laughter] )) 

595.66 596.77 A: right 

596.56 599.53 B: (( you know and i'm like you're talking to me [laughter] ))
