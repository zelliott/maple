17.95 19.11 A: (( oh okay )) 

18.64 21.69 B: actually i don't think it's enough [laughter] 

20.22 28.59 A: yeah i agree with you five fifteen an hour is not uh is not gonna cut it in these days especially if you live in a city i think 

24.55 25.55 B: no 

25.75 26.95 B: no it's not 

27.98 37.66 B: right i mean if you if you're a single person and you're just starting out i mean with that even working you know eighty hours a week you would never even be able to pay rent 

37.35 39.00 A: yeah absolutely 

38.43 40.41 B: i mean it stinks i mean 

39.61 47.32 A: it does stink i mean i think you know if you're a high school student living at home it's probably good but other other than that nobody could survive on it 

46.86 51.93 B: that's true that's true i mean where i work they start them out at ten forty an hour 

47.64 48.64 A: yeah 

51.50 52.55 A: wow 

52.12 58.70 B: you know and and that to me isn't even a lotta money because we have a lot of single working mums 

58.09 59.33 A: uh-huh 

59.04 61.72 B: and they they still can't make ends meet 

61.62 63.53 A: yeah 

62.19 63.14 B: (( you know )) 

63.19 67.03 B: so that really stinks do do you live at home with your parents 

64.99 65.67 A: yeah 

66.44 69.33 A: no i don't actually i'm i'm on my own 

68.83 74.80 B: yeah me too but i support i still have two uh adult children home that i support 

74.26 75.66 A: oh really 

75.11 79.62 B: and i just think my god if i ever left my job and had to go back to a minimum wage 

79.10 80.92 A: oh yeah there's no way 

80.41 83.42 B: never be able to afford it never 

82.44 88.14 A: there's no way yeah fortunately i uh i'm just supporting myself right now but that's hard enough anyway 

87.64 99.99 B: [laughter] that's true that's true i know um my youngest daughter just came home from arizona and she's been looking for a job and you know she has experience it's like 

89.68 90.97 A: yeah 

100.64 104.16 B: you know what are you going to do you know where are you going go 

102.07 103.26 A: yeah 

103.62 108.54 A: it's tough these days especially i mean it's hard it's hard to find a job 

105.74 106.84 B: yeah 

108.22 117.45 B: yeah my youngest daughter is still in school and she she will work every once in a while at a at a a store here you know for just minimum wage 

116.82 118.02 A: uh-huh 

117.72 129.24 B: that's just enough to pay for her cell phone and pay her um you know gas for her car and you know otherwise i have to wind up picking up everything for her and that really kinda stinks 

123.58 124.94 A: right 

128.53 132.08 A: yeah yeah that is she in high school or in college 

130.72 133.07 B: [laughter] no she's in college 

132.46 133.93 A: she's in college okay 

133.10 138.15 B: yeah she's thirty i sense that she's going to be a college s- student for the rest of her life 

137.52 141.53 A: yeah well my brother actually is thirty and he just graduated so 

141.25 144.87 B: well she started late she quit school when she was sixteen 

144.24 145.27 A: uh-huh 

144.88 157.31 B: and then you know she worked for a while you know a crappy job and then she went back part time to college and you know she got her g. e. d. and now she's decided she loves college but she can't go out on her own either 

157.05 158.41 A: yeah 

157.36 164.48 B: even on the money that you know she does make she could never afford to go out on her own alone and that really kinda stinks 

163.88 166.10 A: yeah it does stink 

164.93 170.33 B: so i mean i think even mcdonalds here where we live offers min- more than minimum wage 

170.51 174.12 A: yeah i would guess i mean i don't know for sure but 

172.76 178.07 B: yeah they start i think at eight something an hour up here and mcdonalds that's pretty 

175.95 177.00 A: uh-huh 

178.15 189.75 B: you know well it's an okay job i guess and you know but it's a you know menial kind of job which you teach in a day and what needs to be done and they're even paying more than what the government says that you should get 

185.48 186.98 A: yeah 

189.57 190.89 A: right 

190.26 193.67 B: and then you wonder why all these people are out on welfare 

194.21 196.56 B: because they can't afford to pay them so 

196.35 198.06 A: yeah exactly 

197.35 204.30 B: you know and the job you get for a minimum wage once they find those those jobs don't even take any kind of insurance so 

204.02 208.25 A: yeah exactly there's no benefits or anything so you're kinda left stranded 

206.34 206.91 B: (( mm )) 

208.30 211.11 A: but uh it looks like bush doesn't care too much so 

210.95 213.34 B: [laughter] and what do you do for a living 

212.83 217.78 A: uh i'm actually in in grad school right now i'm i'm a a law student 

217.51 218.16 B: (( mm )) 

218.25 219.52 A: yeah 

218.94 222.75 B: so you'll definitely be making more than the minimum wage when you get done with that 

222.09 225.45 A: uh yeah hopefully i did something wrong if i'm not 

225.46 226.34 B: (( [mn] )) 

225.49 232.72 A: but uh yeah i i just came back i i i worked for about three years after college and decided that uh it was time to go back to school 

232.11 236.63 B: go back to school further your education make better mon- money than minimum wage 

236.11 241.67 A: yeah exactly plus that the job market was getting pretty tough so it seemed like a good time to go back to school 

241.07 245.83 B: mm well that's a good thing you know and you're fortunate that you can go back to school 

242.38 244.22 A: yeah 

245.73 248.49 A: yeah yeah definitely 

247.57 258.98 B: yeah see i could never do that i'm older and i've worked for my company for twenty years and you know we've seen three hand changes and like i said even people starting out in my company 

252.46 253.55 A: uh-huh 

258.86 263.80 B: at at the lowest level you know make ten forty an hour so 

263.24 264.47 A: yeah 

263.90 266.95 B: i don't know how they can say oh yeah minimum wage is 

267.00 269.25 B: what five ten or five twenty five 

269.02 278.43 A: yeah it's ridiculous i mean i know uh i i waited tables for a while and you know they don't your hourly rate is is like two fifty an hour but you get tips but 

270.39 272.08 B: yeah 

278.42 284.52 A: regardless the check you get at the end of the week is ridiculous i mean it's it's not you know it it doesn't do anything for you [mn] 

281.29 282.35 B: right 

284.07 288.29 B: and now if you um don't you have to 

288.33 298.41 B: um actually when you when you waiter i know in the state of new jersey they also will figure uh how much of a percentage of of a tip you'll get 

298.60 302.69 B: so if you don't report that you're making like all your tips 

302.29 303.83 A: yeah 

303.13 309.15 B: they take a percentage of what they think by by what you made on your hourly wage 

305.00 306.24 A: yeah 

309.09 318.16 A: yeah that's that's true in in d. c. too and i mean there's ways around it but yeah that's true i mean they they you know they ask you to report your tips too which is 

311.50 313.31 B: (( oh is it )) 

318.53 320.72 A: ridiculous but 

319.35 322.30 B: mm mm yeah my son's a hairdresser in new york and um 

322.31 329.47 B: you know they they just automatically take a percentage on his hourly rate on what his tips would be and thank god for him 

326.40 328.35 A: mhm 

329.51 331.69 B: they figure a lot lower 

331.53 332.66 A: yeah 

331.82 337.03 B: than what he really gets because um working in the city you make really good tips 

336.32 338.31 A: yeah i would bet i would bet 

337.33 340.10 B: yeah you make really good tips over there 

339.81 347.48 A: uh that's cool so what about in new jersey i've noticed that um [lipsmack] there's no self serve gas it's all full serve and i guess 

346.41 348.21 B: [lipsmack] yeah it's all full it's always been 

347.99 354.47 A: always been i wondered do you think uh i mean through like i suspect minimum wage i guess what what do those guys make you think 

348.67 349.54 B: (( mhm )) 

354.40 356.21 B: they probably make minimum wage 

355.77 359.65 A: yeah and do you tip those guys i never know when i'm up there no 

358.15 358.91 B: no 

359.28 359.97 B: no 

359.70 361.90 A: you get exact change back and 

361.21 364.09 B: get exact change you pay what you what you buy 

363.74 364.82 A: okay 

364.24 368.83 B: and and that's it and we're one of the few states that do that now 

368.44 371.87 A: yeah i haven't really seen that too much outside when i drive through 

370.08 370.82 B: yeah 

371.06 379.18 B: we drive to florida and it's oh my god i hate this [laughter] yeah but you know like um here it's just 

374.62 375.71 A: really 

379.67 389.45 B: you know you you know that when you pull into a gas station you don't have to get out and get yourself all wet like on today it's raining and you know stuff like that so 

386.14 387.56 A: yeah 

388.25 395.12 A: yeah that's good i always i always get uncomfortable 'cause i don't know if i should you know i never know when to tip 'em or whatever so this is good to know 

392.74 395.02 B: yep no don't tip them 

395.03 397.81 B: and they're mostly all asians here in new jersey 

397.31 399.20 A: oh really huh 

397.86 412.51 B: yeah some kinda asian people that own them so they must make really good money and then it's usually family members and asian people that work for them so i don't know what what they make but the one guy by us here he says he came here 

406.34 407.53 A: uh-huh 

412.43 415.38 B: and he bought this business on a franchise 

415.05 416.12 A: uh-huh 

415.47 419.29 B: so that he could go back to send send the money back to his country 

419.00 420.20 A: oh wow 

419.72 429.30 B: so i guess he's making more than the minimum wage because his gas is always lower than everybody else's mhm yeah so and that that's 

422.15 423.46 A: yeah 

425.49 427.35 A: oh really ah 

429.39 434.51 B: that's outrageous too another thing if gas stations put that on their tip [laughter] people 

433.03 444.87 A: oh yeah exactly that is ridiculous i was uh i i lived out in san francisco for a couple of years and the gas up there was absurd i mean at the peak at which i think was like a year and a half ago uh 

434.62 436.66 B: (( think that they're paying gas prices )) 

438.93 439.75 B: uh-huh 

444.92 453.89 A: it was over two dollars like two two ten and like to fill up the car it would get up to like thirty five bucks a a time yeah which is ridiculous 

447.41 449.40 B: mhm oh that's outrageous 

451.35 452.73 B: oh that's crazy 

453.48 462.86 B: that's crazy and people don't want us to go to war because they say oh its war over oil but you know what you hear nobody complaining when the gas prices go down 

462.29 463.95 A: yeah that's true 

463.29 472.30 B: you know like some places here now are a dollar thirty four and a dollar twenty nine and people are real happy about that i mean not that i'm i i was 

467.72 468.88 A: uh-huh 

472.42 478.28 B: you know for the war but you know you don't hear anybody complaining when you pay less money for your gas 

477.42 484.64 A: yeah that's true although i don't think that uh you know that's a legitimate reason to to do it it might be a good side benefit but 

484.11 487.57 B: well i i agree with you there but you know 

488.32 497.00 B: again back to somebody making the minimum wage if you've got a decent car and you're spending twenty five bucks a week to fill your tank you know there's twenty five 

497.09 501.58 B: you know there's what five six hours worth of work right there a week just to fill your tank 

501.00 502.63 A: yeah that's true 

501.91 504.47 B: so it really it really kinda stinks 

504.04 508.42 A: yeah it does kinda stink i mean i think i think it's it's rough i mean 

507.75 509.78 B: so how did you get into fisher 

509.54 516.37 A: um you know i um was just kinda looking around on uh the there's a website called craig's list it 

516.37 527.78 A: tells like um [lipsmack] a bunch of stuff for sale like people selling tickets and furniture and stuff and i just kinda looked around and there was a post on there for that and it said you know make thirty bucks in thirty minutes and i i like to do these sort of things so 

520.55 521.38 B: uh-huh 

527.15 528.31 B: yeah me too 

528.47 529.76 B: me too i thought 

529.13 530.93 A: is is this the first call you've done 

530.50 535.40 B: no this is my second yeah but i've tried like two or three times in between 

531.69 532.81 A: oh really 

535.33 548.53 B: to get connected to somebody and you know you're waiting twenty minutes and finally i just i hung up i said i'll do it another day but it's kinda to make thirty bucks you know thirty bucks is thirty bucks 

539.45 540.67 A: oh really 

545.77 547.63 A: yeah 

547.71 553.18 A: i'll take that i mean six hours of minimum wage work [laughter] in thirty minutes so 

551.03 559.62 B: yeah that's that's that's true that's true but it's it's a funny thing though to have to talk to somebody the last time i got somebody that was 

559.73 562.07 B: she was into nascar racing 

561.79 562.96 A: oh really 

562.22 565.85 B: and i am too so it was like oh this is great we 

565.16 566.43 A: oh nice 

565.98 571.90 B: yeah so and actually we were disappointed when they hung up on us you know 'cause they just kinda cut you off 

569.73 571.03 A: really [laughter] 

571.57 572.76 A: (( oh okay )) 

572.18 581.92 B: at the end of the conversation you could be in the middle of a sentence and which is coming up real short here you know but they they just cut you off and then you leave your comment so 

581.53 582.86 A: oh that's cool 

581.94 585.68 B: but i've talked to somebody about minimum wage you know or uh 

584.93 587.23 A: and what was your topic last time 

586.83 588.48 B: (( um [lipsmack] )) 

588.51 590.40 B: it was sporting events 

589.86 591.19 A: (( oh okay )) 

590.60 593.45 B: so and we both had in common 

593.46 599.89 B: that we both go to nascar races so it was really you know an easy topic for us to talk about
