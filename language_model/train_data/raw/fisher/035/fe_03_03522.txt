0.82 2.59 B: hi hi 

0.99 2.16 A: hello 

2.89 7.04 A: um i'm barbara [laughter] [laughter] okay [mn] um [mn] 

4.12 5.41 B: i'm judy [laughter] [noise] [noise] 

7.56 11.37 A: i don't i don't really this is not something that i've thought a lot about uh 

11.35 13.86 B: oh really um [lipsmack] 

13.77 26.69 B: yeah i wasn't quite sure what the minimum wage was actually [mn] but um i definitely think it should be increased um it i don't think it's sufficient at all [mn] if you think of uh someone who's working 

26.67 41.55 B: um tw- you know forty hours a week at five dollars an hour they're making like two hundred a little more than two hundred a week [mn] and if they have a family to support i mean i don't know where you live but i live in new york city and that's like um 

39.19 39.79 A: (( [noise] [noise] )) 

42.22 45.55 B: [mn] virtually impossible to s live on that [mn] 

45.00 55.85 A: [noise] [noise] well i i just don't know what the minimum wage is but i agree that people should um have decent just decent wages it's just that because i don't really know the actual facts 

55.99 57.81 A: [mn] it's hard for me to have 

57.84 59.01 A: an opinion 

59.04 59.89 B: mhm 

59.27 70.21 A: i don't know whether there is pending legislation for that [mn] or whether there is uh or whether this is just a topic they introduce just for us to throw around [laughter] in the air i just don't [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] 

69.35 75.09 B: no i mean it is that it is something that um the government is debating [mn] um 

74.97 88.95 B: you know that periodically they do raise the minimum wage and [mn] i mean there is a lot of discussion about it because like some employers i mean they do have a valid point like they hire high school kids or something [mn] you know sixteen seventeen year olds and 

88.80 91.69 B: um you know they they feel that 

91.49 102.36 B: maybe they you know they could pay them maybe four dollars an hour or something like that [mn] which would be you know sufficient for a a high school kid who's just doing it to make some you know spare change or something 

102.13 115.71 B: [mn] but um you know for someone who's who is fully employed and who has [mn] you know [mn] bills to pay and and kids to support then i think that's almost um 

115.89 119.47 B: [mn] you know ridiculous to to assume that someone 

119.55 125.88 B: could survive on on on that um you know and then there's the question of you know 

126.03 140.79 B: does the government intervene should the free market prevail you know [mn] um [mn] but you know there there are a lot of people who perform [mn] vital services [mn] and [mn] you know this is this is their livelihood 

141.31 144.70 B: and i'm sure they work just as hard as anyone else 

144.71 154.58 B: you know in what they're doing if they're doing manual labor you know physical labor it's very difficult and for you know any number of reasons 

155.24 165.94 B: this is [noise] you know what they're being offered and um a lot of times they might not even have benefits with that you know how do they afford healthcare and and other things [noise] 

165.43 169.53 A: [noise] [noise] [mn] well there's no question that that's one side of the argument [mn] um 

169.57 179.37 A: of course um [mn] i think so that um traditionally the arguments on the other side which also have some validity 

179.35 182.09 A: and don't get me wrong because actually i'm 

181.99 194.70 A: very [laughter] i'm very much a left wing liberal myself but [mn] but as you know i'm sure [mn] um the other side of the argument is if the minimum wage is priced too high [mn] that means some employers 

194.50 208.59 A: are just priced out of what they can afford to run a business on [mn] and so the question gets down to whether [mn] the government can step in and say well everyone including the college kids that or the high school that are just flipping burgers [mn] 

208.36 212.42 A: needs to be paid a wage that um [mn] uh 

212.67 223.15 A: the provider for a family would need to provide for a family [mn] and [mn] it it's very difficult and [mn] maybe the better answer would be to try to structure it so that 

223.19 224.26 A: um 

224.40 226.50 A: certain industries were 

226.68 235.73 A: excluded but then how do you define that you know how would you avoid [mn] exploiting groups of people it it's a it's a complicated issue and i you know i think 

235.79 245.62 A: at first glance it certainly looks as if we should have high minimum wages because certainly nobody should [mn] be earning small amounts of money [mn] um [lipsmack] 

246.92 261.87 A: but but i do think i do appreciate the fact that it is a complex issue i i suppose what bothers me equally [mn] is the people at the other end of the spectrum who reel in hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars for doing work that [mn] i suspect um [lipsmack] 

262.13 266.19 A: is not that much more valuable than the average middle class earner 

266.21 279.33 B: [noise] [noise] well that's another issue i mean there's there are plenty of people who who earn maybe a little bit more than the minimum wage and and and work very hard you know ver- you know versus many people who are [mn] 

279.55 291.68 B: many many times that and i mean that's a whole other issue the the the discrepancy in income and and is that fair [mn] but for someone who's you know trying to support a family it's 

291.96 301.66 B: i mean i see where you're saying like you know a lot of small businesses maybe couldn't operate but there's there's so many people who um [mn] [lipsmack] work off the books anyway 

295.63 296.21 A: (( [noise] )) 

301.81 303.35 B: and maybe they end up 

303.23 317.74 B: being paid more now if they were paid more on the books then they'd be paying taxes out of that and that money would be going back to the government [mn] but there's like all these illegal immigrants who are being hired who pay [mn] you know who are paid on a daily basis [mn] 

317.54 321.28 B: and um so they're they're ending up making 

321.33 330.48 B: the same if not more on per diem basis and they're not paying any taxes [mn] so if the minimum wage is higher then maybe the employers could just hire them 

330.79 341.28 B: legally i mean well if they're illegal i guess they can't hire them legally [mn] but at least if the minimum wage is higher then more money would be being paid out in taxes anyway you know i 

341.04 350.20 B: mean if you're making minimum wage [mn] two hundred a week that's before taxes [mn] you [laughter] know you you know you're paying state federal city taxes 

348.82 363.32 A: [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] yeah i think those people who make minimum wage aren't [mn] contributing much to the tax base but i think that's fine i think that the rest of us should supplement those people [mn] what concerns me more is that they're not being able to establish 

363.16 374.29 A: um a significant contribution to social security [mn] and other programs that then at the other end of the line they won't be able to draw very much from [mn] whereas someone who is 

374.20 383.22 A: earning much more is able to make full contributions to social security and then even though they may need it much less gets much more at the other end 

382.77 384.09 B: that's true too 

384.17 388.25 B: i mean you know all these things have to be taken into consideration [mn] 

387.50 394.23 A: [mn] well of course they do but you know [mn] that's that's the point i think these things are complex and and one reason that 

394.58 402.26 A: they're still being debated [laughter] is that it is it is a complex equation [mn] and if we if we price 

402.15 411.18 A: you know if we say nobody can be paid less than a certain amount not even the high school kids flipping burgers [mn] or the babysitters then um 

411.94 417.83 A: you know e- people who just need an an entry level or just need a little bit of help 

418.30 422.07 A: you know [mn] a little pin money so that they can 

422.19 431.82 A: have more in high school or college but they don't really need to support themselves [mn] just may not be able to find anything so a it is it's complicated 

431.68 441.38 B: well i think you know someone who hires a babysitter doesn't necessarily pay them minimum wage i don't i don't i mean i don't think every babysitter is making minimum wage [mn] 

440.83 448.14 A: they are around here [laughter] if the if the if the minimum wage is five dollars an hour [mn] yeah um the washington d._c. area 

441.78 443.62 B: oh really where do you live 

447.43 449.85 B: (( uh-huh really that's what they [mn] )) 

449.04 457.01 A: [mn] i don't hire babysitters very often it's true but [mn] they often command you know five fifty six fifty even for one kid [lipsmack] 

456.24 457.04 B: (( uh-huh )) 

457.48 458.51 B: (( [noise] mhm [mn] [cough] )) 

457.94 462.27 A: when i when i was in high school i got fifty cents an hour [laughter] [laughter] 

460.10 466.59 B: yeah [laughter] exactly [mn] oh inflation [laughter] but um 

467.17 477.68 B: [mn] but i mean a lot you know they're paid off the book up until what fifteen hundred dollars or something you're allowed to pay or you don't have to pay their social security or something like that [mn] and [noise] 

476.52 487.82 A: [noise] [mn] right but it's just a it's just a kind of a i think a guide that if there is a minimum wage not that anybody thinks about that i think when you're paying babysitters [noise] but um it is something that helps to i think 

487.80 495.38 A: act as a guide for what what is a reasonable amount to pay [mn] someone for any kind of work um [mn] 

493.49 494.42 B: (( mhm )) 

495.44 508.58 A: but certainly somebody who's working in a mcdonalds will have to make [mn] minimum wage [mn] if somebody who's working as a part time [mn] orderly uh will have to make minimum wage uh you know that sort of thing 

509.39 515.76 B: [noise] [noise] i mean um [lipsmack] yeah i you know i just i just feel that um 

509.88 510.47 A: (( [noise] )) 

516.12 527.74 B: the government has a basic responsibility i think to provide certain social services i mean someone who's making minimum wage would be better off probably on welfare 'cause they'd be getting more off benefits 

527.94 535.02 B: you know you could be working minimum wage and not [mn] get health insurance whereas if you're on welfare you could get health insurance mm [noise] 

534.19 539.70 A: [mn] well that's another issue and i personally believe that everybody should have healthcare coverage 

540.26 544.55 A: and it shouldn't be related to how much income you have [mn] um i i think that's a 

544.67 552.90 A: a separate issue and governmental benefits and programs i think is also a separate issue and certainly people who are trying to provide for a family [mn] 

552.92 559.76 A: you know need to be able to make a decent living but th- the problem is that that overlaps with the people who [mn] um 

559.66 567.85 A: you know [mn] at some of these some of these lower paying jobs really don't provide that much of a service but they do just provide a little extra pin money and so 

567.71 581.82 A: how do you discriminate you know how how do you [mn] when there's a minimum ri- wage for for everything no matter what [mn] um even the guy that you know isn't may- maybe just sitting by the telephone studying and is required to just 

581.90 587.17 A: pick up the phone occasionally when it rings then [mn] again there'll be some jobs that just go away 

587.24 588.25 A: um 

588.33 589.45 A: it's it's 

589.61 591.21 A: it's problematic 

591.81 593.16 B: (( [noise] mm [mn] )) 

592.62 595.08 A: it seems like ten minutes have passed by now [laughter] 

594.40 596.52 B: [laughter] not quite [laughter] 

595.46 596.88 A: [laughter] 

597.06 599.95 B: well i still i still think [mn] i mean
