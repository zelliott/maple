2.75 3.71 A: hi 

4.34 5.47 A: from where 

5.21 7.70 B: anthanetis california santiago 

6.55 7.40 A: (( ah this )) 

7.53 12.25 A: this is geraldine from denver ah from ah colorado springs colorado 

11.77 16.47 B: oh colorado springs oh welcome [laughter] beautiful place there 

13.22 14.35 A: yeah 

14.37 15.76 A: [laughter] hi 

16.31 18.88 A: it is it is indeed 

18.41 21.99 B: [laughter] okay so we're supposed to say 

21.09 23.18 A: minimum wage i guess 

22.90 26.65 B: is it sufficient you want to go first [laughter] 

25.15 26.31 A: um 

26.99 33.79 A: i don't think five fifteen is enough money for somebody to from minimum wage you can't live on that 

34.81 42.80 A: you can't you know that doesn't even make the the bare minimum amount of of ah money to to you know live on 

34.99 35.78 B: yeah 

43.37 50.97 B: yeah i mean it's just it seems like it's way below minimum [laughter] five fifteen an hour i mean i don't ah 

49.43 50.60 A: yeah 

51.41 62.26 B: i you know some of the places here where you ah you know like target and those kind of stores you you make like seven or eight dollars an hour that's still not enough [laughter] 

61.58 63.07 A: yeah that's true 

62.74 68.09 B: for these ah kids to work on especially after the government takes out the money 

67.90 71.24 A: [laughter] and you know they take their money first 

68.44 69.57 B: but they have 

70.23 73.83 B: [laughter] yeah so ah 

73.95 78.07 B: yeah i don't feel five fifteen an hour is sufficient at all 

78.12 81.61 B: and i don't really know too many places that pay that do you 

81.76 82.71 B: lots of them 

81.79 82.84 A: um 

82.85 84.27 A: well i know 

84.11 87.28 A: it's like ah restaurants and such pay less than that 

87.11 101.53 A: so they are required by law though they you know very rarely do they ever do it or anybody enforces it but if after your tips and everything if you don't make minimum wage of five fifteen the company has to pay you that 

101.17 102.55 B: oh i see 

102.01 106.01 A: but um um i don't know of any 

106.12 113.03 A: cashiers or or ah restaurants where that happens you know it's kind of whatever you get or to 

109.45 110.43 B: mhm 

113.24 114.62 A: kind of deal 

114.54 115.56 B: yeah 

114.71 122.68 A: they say that the company has to pay you more you know because you didn't do so good on tips or something like that you're probably not going to work there for very long 

122.39 123.30 B: uh-huh 

123.22 127.54 A: um but yeah there's there's too many people i think out there who are 

127.61 139.62 A: um are working for a minimum wage in in like um restaurants or or you know fast food places and such like that that are homeless and that's just scarier than hell 

139.35 141.94 B: yeah it really is i mean 

141.06 143.56 A: the working homeless are just 

144.01 152.79 B: i i wish there was some way where we could have a a greater distribution of money you know in in terms 'cause it seems like there's so many 

152.83 156.80 B: people that make so much money and then there's some that just make the minimum [laughter] wage 

156.41 157.90 A: yeah 

157.16 162.90 B: and if if it it was more equally balanced everybody could have everything they needed 

162.37 170.03 A: well if you raise the minimum wage up too you should also um probably looking at putting some small businesses out of business 

169.66 171.76 B: that's right that's right 

170.22 178.29 A: you know or they w- they wouldn't be able to afford it or that they would have to charge so much for their services or or whatever that that would ah 

178.39 181.28 A: put them out of the the thing too but 

180.36 184.15 B: yes i just ah i didn't think about that but ah 

183.49 184.61 A: yeah 

184.28 186.19 B: yeah i i used to work in 

186.22 194.10 B: ah retail and yeah if you everytime i would get a little bit of a raise our payroll [laughter] expenses would go way up 

193.58 195.18 A: (( mm yeah )) 

194.48 195.92 B: you know and ah 

196.19 201.38 B: it just even twenty five cents an hour would really affect us quite a bit [laughter] 

201.89 207.78 A: mm you know then um you know then you had people ah benefits and stuff like that 

201.93 202.84 B: so 

207.98 212.56 A: because you know it's hard to be able to afford the payroll and 

208.08 208.97 B: mhm 

213.26 214.77 A: all that too yeah 

213.36 223.26 B: yeah there's only like so much in the piece of pie you know and so you're right if if if the minimum wage goes up and they cut it off something else [laughter] 

223.41 227.38 B: you know 'cause otherwise they go out of business that's right 

224.25 225.31 A: (( but )) 

227.64 239.25 A: then again you're also looking at at um you know jobs being held by kids is one thing and which i i really think the the minimum wage is for you know 

239.45 240.36 B: mhm 

239.57 240.59 A: um 

241.12 247.55 A: but your you know being held by adults who are looking for it i mean you don't have a paper boy anymore you have some man 

247.56 251.43 A: and or some um adult running and doing papers 

251.41 252.52 B: mhm 

251.89 254.19 A: you know i mean there's not really 

254.82 256.79 A: jobs for kids anymore 

257.24 261.48 B: yeah and as the unemployment rate goes up 

261.59 268.45 B: you know there's going to be more people willing to take these minimum hour wages as to have any kind of money coming in 

268.21 272.35 A: yeah yeah as there unemployment runs out we have a high 

268.84 269.99 B: so 

270.01 270.70 B: (( um )) 

272.43 275.48 A: unemployment rate here in colorado springs right now the 

275.80 280.08 A: the all the high tech jobs in in the industry has just gone south 

279.90 280.78 B: (( mm )) 

280.31 289.98 A: and um you know we've got a lot of people who are who you know are have been on employment for thirteen fourteen months now it's gone and 

290.20 292.93 A: you know they're just trying to keep their house or 

292.28 293.84 B: mhm 

293.41 296.16 A: and everything right now so yeah 

295.87 307.04 B: well it would probably if if they were laid off it'd probably be better to receive unemployment than receive minimum wage at another job you'd probably make make more money 

304.81 314.90 A: exactly well up to a point up to a point um my husband was laid off um five times in four years it was 

307.33 308.25 B: yeah 

313.93 315.52 B: oh my gosh 

315.22 319.83 A: it was yeah it was pretty pretty harsh and he took some part time jobs 

319.90 330.82 A: and ah his part time job ended up panning out and being a a ah full time you know getting him another full time job he was only unemployed for 

331.00 333.83 A: he had two part time jobs um 

333.91 345.00 A: and that going against his unemployment you know as as dollar for dollar we were fifty dollars ahead but um the little part time job ended up turning into a 

344.93 356.83 A: a full time job and he was real happy with it stunned me out i was i was stunned i couldn't believe it could not believe it [laughter] but it it worked out and it worked out well 

348.50 350.01 B: yeah that's good 

350.82 352.97 B: [laughter] 

356.19 360.12 B: and he's you know making min- minimum wage is that right or 

359.28 365.44 A: mm um let's see no he was he was making more than minimum wage but not not too much more 

360.15 360.88 B: (( you know )) 

363.19 364.43 B: oh that's good 

365.07 366.29 B: mhm 

365.72 372.11 A: you know and it was it's it was an office job that ended up being a now he runs the place 

366.74 367.78 B: yeah 

372.22 376.24 A: and everything it's three months man it's just amazing but 

376.35 380.58 A: i i don't know if he would have taken a a job that was minimum wage 

380.82 391.81 B: yeah well still it's i think that having a job because it gives you a sense of worth i mean it's probably better for him having a job than even at minimum wage than not having a job at all 

386.65 387.53 A: yeah 

391.28 396.37 A: that was the whole point you you know it put us fifty dollars ahead but it was also getting out there and 

396.50 398.69 A: you know doing something and 

397.45 401.03 B: yeah a sense of value and worth [laughter] 

400.23 408.55 A: yeah the first couple of times he was laid off it was real hell but the last you know this last time he ah didn't just sit around and and ah 

408.72 422.39 A: you know do the ads in the newspaper but he he went and got these two part time jobs and everything and it really helped with his whole attitude i think after so many times of being laid off he kind of figured oh this is really not him [laughter] and he just he 

413.45 414.59 B: mhm 

421.32 422.85 B: yeah right 

422.20 430.51 A: you know like before he was like oh why didn't they keep me and [laughter] even though he was one of like ninety two laid off [laughter] you know 

425.84 427.95 B: [laughter] 

429.40 433.52 B: [laughter] right [laughter] 

431.90 439.88 A: [laughter] but um yeah the as far as jobs out there there wasn't very many and and minimum wage is you know 

440.03 440.59 A: (( [mn] )) 

440.86 445.30 A: if you if you have minimum wage you're below the poverty level you know 

444.22 445.17 B: yeah 

445.65 453.40 B: yeah and i just i've noticed a lot more adults taking those minimum wage jobs you know i just notice that um 

453.50 459.42 B: you know at the fast food places and things like that you know where normally would you would see kids 

457.06 457.90 A: yeah 

459.44 462.52 A: i mean even kids aren't delivering your pizzas anymore 

461.98 463.88 B: (( i know [laughter] )) 

462.81 466.94 A: you've got you've got a man doing it as a second job you know or something 

466.09 469.13 B: yeah yeah that's definitely true 

469.17 476.18 A: you know and it's like i i can't think of any any industry right now that is kid you know 

476.22 487.31 A: kid related i mean you've got th- that is solely kid related it used to be you couldn't find anybody but kids to do you know fast food even you know um 

478.08 479.03 B: mhm 

483.70 484.86 B: mhm 

487.21 492.08 A: all kinds of stuff we've got we've got adults doing the car wash 

491.81 492.78 B: mhm 

492.32 496.04 A: you know and all that and that's working just for kids [laughter] you know 

495.12 506.44 B: [laughter] oh goodness yeah for some reason i thought the minimum wage was higher than five fifteen when she said that i was absolutely shocked 

499.25 500.91 A: yeah 

506.46 513.46 A: yeah yeah i'm forty now when i was a a kid and you know doing those ah um 

506.89 507.84 B: because 

513.84 519.43 A: ah minimum wage jobs i think it was like like four eighty 

519.45 524.02 A: four ninety i ah it wasn't very much farther away from the five fifteen 

523.91 525.36 B: oh yeah 

524.74 528.07 A: you know and and so i was kind of surprised that it was so low 

528.11 529.67 B: well when i um 

529.82 535.08 B: you know when i first started in retail my wage was two dollars and ten cents an hour 

534.84 536.37 A: oh my goodness 

535.72 537.30 B: and so that was 

537.36 539.63 B: like twenty five years ago or something 

539.93 549.70 B: so that must have been the minimum at that time so but it still is when you think of the cost of living and how much it's gone up that's not that much of an increase from two 

542.69 543.93 A: wow 

548.77 551.55 A: it it has not been increased very much 

551.36 558.27 B: yeah so it's it's really you know it's it's hard for anybody to live on that i think 

558.44 560.55 B: it'd be impossible [laughter] 

559.65 571.08 A: i think it would be impo- i know that you know i make more than that and both me and my husband make more than that and we live in a in you know well we live in a part of town where where the schools are good 

570.91 571.84 B: mhm 

571.03 579.70 A: and everything 'cause i've got a fourteen year old but you know w- we make m- we make just the minimum amount you know there's not a lot of cush there 

573.33 574.15 B: mhm 

577.33 578.21 B: mhm 

578.98 580.28 B: yeah 

579.73 590.57 A: and everything you know now that my s- my husband's got this job though it's going to be better but you know it's just creeping by and it's like i make i make almost twice as much as a minimum 

584.92 585.89 B: yeah 

590.72 591.73 B: yeah 

590.79 599.95 A: and it's like you know if if it was just my son and i if i just have to support my son and i we couldn't make it we couldn't make it on what i make let alone 

598.67 599.78 B: mhm
