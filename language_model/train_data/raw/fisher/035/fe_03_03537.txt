7.34 9.05 B: yeah [laughter] 

9.60 21.16 A: [mn] um i i could say right up front i think that the five dollars and fifteen cents is a joke [noise] especially considering we're up to what four dollars round trip now for um subway bus fare 

15.00 16.41 B: (( [mn] [noise] mhm )) 

20.82 26.73 B: yeah yeah exactly i mean the cost of living [mn] especially out here in new york is [mn] 

27.62 31.47 B: is really high and i don't think minimum wage cuts it [laughter] 

30.74 40.97 A: [noise] [mn] i i it's been a long time since i even knew what minimum wage was i i still was under the impression it had to be somewhere like eight [laughter] dollars an hour i'm kinda shocked [mn] 

38.61 40.04 B: (( yeah )) 

40.44 44.45 B: yeah well i think the up here what i've discovered is that um 

42.75 43.56 A: (( [noise] [mn] )) 

44.97 49.02 B: like i think kind of the unofficial minimum wage is a little higher i guess 

49.35 58.79 B: it's kinda like if you go into like what normally is a minimum wage job you're gonna get a little more than [mn] like where i'm from in north carolina like you would definitely get you know five dollars fifteen cents 

58.96 61.88 A: are are you calling are you in north carolina right now 

61.40 62.91 B: no i'm in new york right now

70.83 75.52 A: uh it's exciting city it's just getting to be very expensive and um 

74.57 82.15 B: yeah yeah it is [mn] and like all the tax increases just approved and or they're trying to approve and everything 

79.91 80.73 A: (( i know )) 

82.08 91.68 A: it's scary i mean i i've been looking for work for a while and [mn] i noticed that [mn] as you said like the unofficial minimum wage seems to be like the seven eight dollar 

91.14 92.53 B: yeah yeah 

91.55 99.06 A: range which still isn't like much to live on [laughter] you know if you multiply it by thirty five hours but um 

94.35 97.19 B: oh definitely up here too yeah 

98.31 99.67 B: yeah 

99.43 105.12 A: so i wonder what it was before i wonder if it's just going up fifteen cents or i mean i don't -ow so 

104.53 106.49 B: yeah i don't know either like i 

106.97 108.11 B: (( [mn] )) 

107.87 113.67 A: that's pretty sad [laughter] i don't know how they expect people to to survive you know 

109.00 110.54 B: yeah [laughter] 

113.82 115.73 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

114.08 114.99 A: (( [mn] um )) 

115.45 123.14 A: i'm just thinking like the price of food [laughter] you know [laughter] alone [mn] like what could you possibly buy so [mn] [mn] 

118.24 119.43 B: right right right 

121.60 127.67 B: right and with all the budget cuts here and people getting laid off too i guess it's 

123.96 124.59 A: (( yeah )) 

128.34 130.07 B: never ending [sigh] 

130.23 130.98 B: (( like )) 

131.02 141.99 A: it's scary i mean yeah they w- they wanna blame it on [mn] you know all the bad things that have happened since september eleventh but i i don't really think that's all that there is too it you know i 

131.91 133.49 B: (( yeah [laughter] )) 

140.48 142.48 B: [noise] right right 

141.79 152.84 A: think there's a lot of [mn] a lot of greed out there you know and [mn] uh i don't know how many jobs you've had [mn] course your working life but i just find that 

145.36 147.85 B: mhm 

152.94 162.93 A: employers don't i don't think they appreciate people well enough you know that you know we have expenses beyond just coming to work everyday you know having lunch and 

160.19 161.65 B: (( [noise] yeah )) 

163.93 166.12 A: (( [mn] you know um it's not enough consideration )) 

164.33 169.29 B: [noise] yeah yeah transportation and housing [mn] yeah everything 

168.08 171.95 A: (( yeah this is basic [laughter] things [mn] you know )) 

169.80 171.30 B: yeah [laughter] 

172.73 174.49 B: yeah 

173.71 182.64 A: [mn] yeah i've seen jobs that say that they want people that live close to the job you know in order to like that would be like a good consideration 

182.05 183.07 B: (( oh )) 

182.71 192.24 A: to hire you if you live close i'm thinking yeah that's probably because they know people you know [mn] get stuck in uh in traffic and then they're paying high costs for 

188.91 189.98 B: mhm 

192.29 194.31 A: transportation so 

193.33 195.43 B: yeah i hadn't seen that that's interesting [noise] 

195.00 203.69 A: yeah i i saw and i thought wow [noise] you know it's not bad enough that you g- have to have the exact experience now you have to [laughter] live in the right location [laughter] [laughter] 

199.75 203.29 B: [laughter] right l- [mn] live in the right place yeah 

204.51 213.49 A: [mn] so yeah it's it's truly shocking i don't actually know enough about like the way the government works to know who's responsible for deciding on the minimum wage 

205.10 206.56 B: (( yeah [noise] )) 

213.57 217.93 A: i don't know if that's like the mayor or the governor or the you know 

217.90 220.41 B: (( yeah i'm not sure either it's you know it's [noise] [mn] )) 

220.07 222.00 A: [mn] i mean i guess it's the same 

222.27 227.35 A: everywhere which makes me wonder if the like the president you know if it's bush i- [mn] 

226.19 230.53 B: yeah i think it is i think it is some kinda federal government something [mn] 

229.41 232.71 A: yeah yeah i guess it must be then 'cause if it's the same everywhere 

232.44 234.35 B: (( yeah )) 

233.26 233.87 A: (( so )) 

234.42 241.65 B: which it kinda like raises if you were like [mn] cost more to live other places should the minimum wage be higher for certain places or not you know 

239.61 243.06 A: r- r- yeah exactly exactly 

243.01 245.53 B: i guess it should be like adjusted for [mn] 

246.07 247.75 B: different places that [mn] [mn] 

247.99 260.83 A: yeah well i i guess we're supposed to be grateful that there even is a minimum wage [laughter] you know as opposed to sweat shops and and things like that you know that pay nothing to poor immigrants who don't know any better you know or a desperate [mn] so 

251.50 253.46 B: (( that's that's true that's true )) 

255.44 256.98 B: yeah yeah 

258.89 259.97 B: right 

261.95 263.90 B: yeah 

263.23 267.03 A: uh that's strange uh makes me curious i'm [noise] gonna have to look that up and 

267.18 269.43 A: uh find out more about it [mn] 

270.20 271.06 A: (( um although i )) 

270.22 271.40 B: (( yeah )) 

271.32 276.78 A: i hope not to be in a position [laughter] where i have to take a minimum wage job [laughter] 

274.09 275.48 B: right [laughter] 

276.16 277.20 B: (( right )) 

277.67 279.82 B: what kind of job are you looking for 

279.15 284.69 A: so [mn] just about anything at this point [laughter] i i used to do like office work but that's 

281.15 282.83 B: yeah oh i understand that 

283.98 285.29 B: mhm 

284.71 297.85 A: [mn] see that's like seems to be like a major area where people are cutting back you know uh i had a a friend that i used to work with and he said that [mn] a major law firm uh they're now outsourcing to india 

288.32 290.70 B: yeah yeah 

298.14 299.14 B: wow 

298.17 306.99 A: [mn] which is amazing to me and i mean i you know i'm sure five dollars and fifteen cents is a huge amount of money to some poor starving 

306.92 316.97 A: uh india you know uh person in new delhi or something and i i i'm just you know you can't compete with that you can't compete with people who are grateful to make a dollar 

310.80 312.59 B: yeah yeah 

316.59 317.79 B: mhm 

317.08 322.20 A: you know um god from their perspective we're just a bunch of rich americans 

321.63 323.56 B: yeah you're right yeah [laughter] 

322.71 328.15 A: so you know and in that respect yes we are [laughter] you know but uh [noise] it's 

325.74 327.17 B: [laughter] 

328.15 340.17 A: uh it's kinda sad to see all this stuff going to other countries you know when [mn] when i you know i'm sure you too walk past starving people with signs saying please help me i'm hungry and you know it's 

331.70 332.70 B: mhm 

338.70 341.58 B: oh yeah all the time yeah

351.40 352.52 B: mhm 

356.42 358.08 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

358.89 364.64 B: and it seems like all the programs that are like meant to help them are getting cut from all the budget stuff here 

363.42 366.17 A: (( [noise] so [mn] right right you know )) 

366.31 367.12 A: so 

367.38 375.62 A: i don't know i mean i'm glad to be here and i i love the city where i can do a lot of walking but [laughter] it's getting harder and harder to live here [mn] 

372.11 373.22 B: (( [laughter] )) 

374.86 376.60 B: [sigh] yeah 

377.30 380.79 B: yeah i've talked to a lot of people who are thinking about moving [noise] out of the city into like 

380.83 382.19 B: suburbs somewhere 

381.81 382.93 A: (( so [noise] mhm yeah )) 

382.33 383.90 B: (( just 'cause like it costs so much )) 

384.88 388.45 A: [mn] well i guess a car's a consideration too you know 

387.70 389.22 B: mhm 

388.52 389.69 A: (( i certainly don't know how )) 

389.73 395.38 A: get five dollars and fifteen cents and pay for gas [laughter] [mn] so 

392.67 394.23 B: right right 

396.35 397.66 B: (( yeah )) 

399.53 407.81 A: yeah mm [mn] well i don't know i don't know what the answer is i'm not a politician but it seems like there's gotta be some sort of better way to help people out [mn] 

408.18 411.15 B: [noise] yeah i don't know what the answer is either [laughter] 

413.46 414.78 B: (( yeah )) 

414.18 416.85 A: yeah [laughter] well i know that with like healthcare and stuff you know like 

416.74 429.26 A: like when you have like a fixed price that they pay for doctors that [mn] i've heard doctors say that the fees are often much less than what they can possibly get you know and it seems like the same sort of thing with minimum wage you know it's like the people who are 

424.84 425.81 B: mhm 

429.21 442.01 A: saying oh well that's a good amount of money they don't have any clue i mean if it is bush or even pataki or whoever that's responsible for it [mn] they don't have to work for five [laughter] dollars and fifteen cents and support their families you know [laughter] 

432.02 433.01 B: right 

439.02 440.16 B: (( yeah )) 

440.38 442.32 B: that's right yeah that's true 

442.05 447.79 A: so it's like it's a whole different kind of of reality you know so [mn] i don't know 

446.80 448.63 B: yeah yeah 

450.64 457.27 A: i don't know what the answer is the only thing i know that's worse is that like waiters um and waitresses make less i know there's like a 

456.51 458.03 B: mhm 

457.45 460.24 A: different minimum wage for them 'cause they also get tips 

459.62 461.92 B: (( yeah i heard that i heard the yeah )) 

460.91 462.78 A: i don't remember what it is uh [mn] 

462.65 466.75 B: i wonder [mn] thought i heard it was like two or three dollars or something something 

466.09 469.86 A: wow wow you you really are [laughter] dependent on tips then 

466.91 468.35 B: something crazy yeah

481.34 482.88 B: mhm 

483.19 489.27 A: you know i've i tell friend at other states you kn- how expensive things are and they just can't believe it [laughter] 

487.76 495.29 B: yeah and yeah it seems like even in like in the grocery store like what a box of cereal costs here and then at home it's totally different [laughter] 

494.57 500.97 A: yeah i know [laughter] it's like you know you're an adult when you talk to your friends about the the prices of [laughter] 

499.29 502.38 B: yeah [laughter] exactly [laughter] 

501.40 513.26 A: as opposed to the latest movie you saw and like who can afford to see a movie at this point you know [mn] [laughter] uh it would take you you know two hours at minimum wage in order uh for you to see a movie and that's no popcorn and 

503.22 504.25 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

504.72 506.84 B: right [laughter] yeah 

510.41 511.59 B: mhm 

512.50 514.59 B: yeah [laughter] exactly

526.21 529.06 B: (( they're supposed to tell us right [mn] think they do )) 

527.39 534.13 A: yeah i think so i haven't done this before a friend had m- mentioned this thing to me i thought it just sounded interesting you know [noise] so but um 

531.43 532.58 B: yeah 

533.28 534.31 B: yeah

540.10 541.96 B: [laughter] yeah that's right 

542.24 544.00 B: (( [laughter] yeah ))

547.14 548.02 B: know 

547.50 548.56 A: (( oh )) 

548.84 554.59 A: well that's i wonder how they pick these topics i guess they're [mn] trying to pick newsworthy things maybe [mn] right well 

551.23 552.57 B: (( [mn] )) 

553.95 556.92 B: yeah something [mn] people can talk about for a while i guess 

558.43 564.70 A: [mn] well i'll tell ya it makes you have more appreciate for eight dollars and hour which i thought was not a lot you know 

562.66 563.93 B: mhm

574.85 576.08 B: (( [mn] yeah )) 

576.74 577.35 B: yeah 

578.03 585.77 A: so yeah with all the i mean at this time of year people getting out of school and stuff so like the competition is gonna be just fierce

585.32 586.73 B: (( yeah [mn] )) 

585.96 591.19 A: you know like people of all age groups are all applying for the same thing and um you

591.67 592.96 A: (( know so [mn] )) 

593.57 599.89 A: i mean i i would think it's hard enough if you're twenty two to live [noise] on minimum wage but i don't know how people twice that age
