132.26 142.17 A: um i'm assuming it's five fifteen i really didn't even know what it was i thought it was around four eighty five that's what i had in my head and then she said that the tape just said it went up to five fifteen 

138.26 139.43 B: oh really

152.41 153.95 A: and then when i'm home i 

154.50 155.95 A: goof around on the computer 

155.77 164.22 B: yeah hey um i know this is a little bit off the subject but um could i just ask you a quick question since you said you're a paralegal how you ever heard of quick claiming before 

156.59 157.73 A: [laughter] 

161.37 162.29 A: sure 

163.96 166.51 A: quick claiming a deed yes sure 

165.12 168.44 B: yeah yeah what's your attitude on that 

167.81 170.62 A: that well depending on the reason you're doing it 

170.16 184.13 B: 'cause i've got a friend uh that's trying to get me involved in doing it for real estate work and i get um i get five hundred dollars for for signing the paperwork putting the you know the the property in my name and then i quick claim it to somebody else and then i get paid you know another thousand dollars 

179.43 180.29 A: right 

183.65 184.55 A: really 

183.93 190.09 B: for the deal yeah and somebody actually i know is doing it and making money in it is it legit do you know 

185.06 185.62 A: (( [mn] )) 

187.97 189.05 A: right 

189.99 192.40 A: that doesn't sound legit to me [laughter] 

192.11 193.21 B: it doesn't 

192.53 195.22 A: i don't know what the reasoning for it is though [lipsmack] 

194.53 199.87 B: because you're actually using your credit to actually uh um to make the deal go through and 

197.91 200.91 A: oh to like get the mortgage and then 

200.25 211.75 B: yeah investors basically invest the money so the property is really not yours but it's but on paper it's showing that it's yours but your quick claimant is somebody else they take on the deed and then you get paid the fee for 

203.99 205.21 A: (( okay [mn] )) 

211.01 215.39 A: and then it goes back into their name afterwards you know i've seen it done before 

212.70 214.61 B: (( it yeah basically yeah )) 

215.10 216.14 B: yeah 

215.43 222.96 A: we call it flipping over here yeah yeah i mean i think it's i guess it's legal or people would get caught doing it 

217.07 219.39 B: that's what it is flipping yeah flipping the dollars 

222.64 232.56 B: yeah that's what i'm saying yeah i mean but someone that i know is is personally making a few thousand dollars a month off of it just by f- flipping the buck that's it 

223.09 224.09 A: (( you know )) 

224.86 227.06 A: it sounds like a quick a good way 

228.95 229.92 A: wow 

231.62 234.10 A: right so they're basically not even doing anything 

233.91 244.53 B: no no it's just their name and their credit basically but but but they but see if your credit is really bad then what they do is they actually they actually will will uh they'll actually fix it up you know 

239.09 240.06 A: right then you 

244.84 246.90 B: they'll they'll fix it up for you for free 

245.93 253.77 A: oh they can yeah my brother in law is in the mortgage business and they can pretty much get anybody [laughter] a mortgage no matter how bad your credit is 

249.14 250.06 B: okay 

251.37 252.24 B: (( yeah )) 

253.39 254.44 B: (( really )) 

253.79 254.79 A: you know 

254.56 255.64 B: wow 

254.99 259.00 A: yeah but i mean anybody working for minimum wage would never be able to get a mortgage 

256.04 257.01 B: yeah 

258.65 263.72 B: oh no i know well it's a joke like out here there's a company called labor ready 

259.07 260.18 A: (( you know )) 

260.38 261.33 A: (( mhm )) 

263.60 278.27 B: and people go there and it is a bunch of lushes that work there you know they're just a bunch of alcoholics they just all they do is they drink they smoke cigarettes they smoke you know marijuana and you know what i mean and and they and they and they work at this place and they make like a quick thirty forty dollars in a day 

268.17 269.18 A: right 

270.25 271.48 A: (( mhm )) 

277.77 278.70 A: wow 

278.19 285.80 B: it's ridiculous you know and and you know it's like it's a joke and and by the time i mean i know this one guy used to go out every single day 

278.89 279.92 A: yeah 

281.54 282.56 A: yeah 

285.42 286.29 A: (( wow )) 

285.99 293.05 B: and and and he'd make you know cash at the end of the day from the you know the drugs you know you could pull it out of the machine there but they pay you every day 

291.06 292.19 A: right 

292.54 293.66 A: right 

293.02 295.66 B: designed for homeless people basically is what it is 

294.27 296.26 A: yeah yeah 

295.64 310.24 B: um i i i hate the company with a passion i mean they're they're they're actually in a big law you know uh you know a big old lawsuit right now and and you know what i mean and they're just trying to you know get get um their money the the company's trying to actually um [lipsmack] 

301.89 303.00 A: right 

310.36 323.03 B: employers are trying to get money because um they've already got sued for the mere fact they that they didn't pay overtime they're supposed to pay double double time after twelve and time and a half after eight 

317.71 318.82 A: really
